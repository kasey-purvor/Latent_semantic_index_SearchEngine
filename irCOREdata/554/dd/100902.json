INTRODUCTION\nRecent years have seen increased interest in the role that\nsolvation pressure plays in the shortening and lengthening of\nmolecular bonds in solvated molecules. One reason for this\nis that many biological processes are sensitive to externally\napplied pressure. For example, pressure can increase the\nfolding rates of proteins which undergo reversible folding\/\nunfolding transitions when subjected to hydrostatic pressures\nof 2\u201310 katm.1,2 Although the consensus is that both pressure\nand temperature are potential denaturants of proteins, the\nformer has the advantage that it affects only the volume of\nthe system whereas the latter involves changes in both the\nvolume and thermal energy.3 Attention is focused in this area\nbecause proteins are now considered for their potential use as\nbiosensors4 and since protein misfolding can have serious\nconsequences including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases.5\nThus, a clear understanding of the specific physical prin-\nciples governing the solvation pressure mechanism offers a\npossible means for controlling pressure-dependent biological\nfunctions.\nSolvent-solute interactions can modify significantly the\nsolvent structure in the region surrounding a solute particle,\nthe cybotactic region, from that in the pure solvent. This\nleads to changes in the solvation pressure experienced by\nsolvated molecules and good evidence for the solvation pres-\nsure effect has been observed using Raman spectroscopy for\nnanosized objects such as carbon nanotubes,6,7 starch grains,8\npure solvents,9,10 and for solvent mixtures.11,12\nThe solvation pressure model asserts that all solutes, in-\ncluding particles immersed in their own liquid, experience a\npressure equal to the cohesive energy density \u0001CED\u0002 of the\nsolvent, which is defined as the energy of vaporization per\nunit volume. This can be obtained from both experimental\nmeasurements and molecular dynamics \u0001MD\u0002 simulations\nusing the molar enthalpy of vaporization \u0001Hvap and molar\ninternal energy change on vaporization \u0001uvap, respectively:\nCED \u0003\n\u0001uvap\nv\n\u0004 \u0001\u0001Hvap \u2212 RT\u0002\/v , \u00011\u0002\nwhere v is the molar volume of the solvent. The two molar\nenergies are related by\nHvap = uvap + Pvvap, \u00012\u0002\nwhere vvap is the molar volume of the vapor and P is the\npressure. A similar expression can be written for the liquid\nphase and since vvap\u00bbv, it follows that\n\u0001Hvap = \u0001uvap + RT , \u00013\u0002\nassuming the van der Waals formula holds for the vapor. The\nCED is often expressed in units of pressure and for con-\ndensed argon, water, ethanol, chloroform, and benzene is\nabout 1.8,14 24, 7, 3, and 3.5 katm, respectively.13\nSeveral theoretical models have been used to describe the\nsolvation pressure mechanism. Schweizer and Chandler in-\nvoke competition between short-range \u0001hard-sphere\u0002 and\nlong-range solvent-solute interactions.14\u201316 Good agreement\nwith experiment can be secured but the fitting parameters are\nsensitive to the hard-sphere radius of the solvent and the\nlength scales of attractive solvent-solute interactions.15 This\nhas focused effort on simpler models, such as the solvation\npressure model, where the pressure effect of a solvent on a\nsolute can be obtained simply from the CED of the liquid.\nDack\u2019s model correlates the internal pressure pi with the\nCED of a liquid system.17 Other workers have tested the\napplicability of this model to nonpolar and polar hydrogen-\nbonded liquids and have shown that for low polar liquids the\nCED can be equated to internal pressure. In contrast, for\nstrongly hydrogen-bonded liquids pi and CED do not reflect\nthe same physical property.18 Moreover, liquid comparisons\nhave shown that even when there is an equivalent internal\npressure it can correspond to a different structural state and\nhence significantly different CED.16,19 Liquid systems whose\nproperties are close to those of a van der Waals fluid are the\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 78, 054113 \u00012008\u0002\n1098-0121\/2008\/78\u00015\u0002\/054113\u000110\u0002 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society054113-1\nexception because here the cohesive energy density and in-\nternal pressure are approximately equal for the liquids being\ncompared.16\nThe internal pressure and CED of a liquid, where the\nformer is a measure of the change in internal energy of 1 mol\nof solvent as it undergoes a small isothermal expansion, are\nrelated by\npi = \u0005 \u0001u\u0001v\u0006T = n\u0001uvapv , \u00014\u0002\nwhere n is a dimensionless ratio which has been related to\nthe strength of the intermolecular forces in the liquid.20 For\nmany liquid systems, the small isothermal expansion may\nnot disrupt all intermolecular interactions associated with the\n1 mol of solvent and so the pi will diverge from the CED.\nFor example, for highly-polar liquids such as water\nn\u00070.07 and the CED deviates strongly from the internal\npressure whereas for nonpolar liquids such as benzene\nn\u00071 and the CED and internal pressure are approximately\nequal.21 Thus, the relationship between the CED and pi may\nindicate the likely validity of the solvation pressure model.\nSo cohesion, and hence CED, results in a ubiquitous solva-\ntion pressure exerted on solutes which can be masked in the\npresence of strong specific interactions. For example, MD\nsimulations of pure ethanol report that the change in bond\nlength with pressure is well described by the solvation pres-\nsure model for all bonds except for O-H, which is lengthened\nwith applied pressure due to masking by hydrogen bonding\nforces.9 In addition, a comparison between experimental data\nand MD simulations demonstrate that masking interactions\nexist in real chloroform which can be reduced or eliminated\nin simplified simulations.10\nThe different length behaviors observed have left workers\ncautious as to the general applicability of the model to\nhydrogen-bonded systems, where the vibrational properties\nof bonds are sensitive to local structure. It has been shown\nthat the results of experimental studies of the change in vi-\nbrational frequencies associated with solvated molecular\nbonds can be interpreted in terms of a general solvation pres-\nsure added to atom-specific masking interactions. Further-\nmore, it has been suggested that Schweizer and Chandler\u2019s\ntheory, adapted to include solvent-solvent effects, could\nachieve decomposition of the molecular interactions into sol-\nvation pressure plus masking interactions. However, the key\nmessage from previous tests of the validity of the solvation\npressure model using Raman spectroscopy and MD simula-\ntions is that simplifications of the potentials appear to reduce\nor eliminate masking the interactions that exist in real liq-\nuids.\nIn this paper we examine the solvation pressure effect on\na simple nonpolar dimer as vapor and immersed in a\nLennard-Jones fluid. The Lennard-Jones \u0001LJ\u0002 fluid has been\nthe focus of a number of studies22,23 and here we use this\nmodel in an attempt to isolate the general solvation pressure\nby studying a liquid system where we expect \bpi\b\u0004\bCED\b\nsuch that the potentials are sufficiently simple to suggest that\nmasking effects are reduced or eliminated. Moreover, here\nthe solvated dimer acts merely as a pressure gauge and we\nuse direct measurements of its bond behavior to test for the\nubiquitous effects of solvation pressure and hence the valid-\nity of the solvation pressure model.\nII. MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS\nTwo simple systems were considered: first a 6084 particle\npure LJ fluid; second the same LJ fluid but with 100 particles\nreplaced by 100 nonpolar dimer molecules. The MD package\nDLPOLY 2.17 \u0001Ref. 24\u0002 was used for all liquid systems stud-\nied.\nA. Simulation of pure LJ fluid\nThe pure fluid consists of N=6084 solvent particles inter-\nacting via the LJ \u000112\u20136\u0002 potential\nUSS\u0001r\u0002 = 4\u0002S\t\u0005\u0003S\nr\n\u000612 \u2212 \u0005\u0003S\nr\n\u00066\n , \u00015\u0002\nwhere \u0003S and \u0002S are the usual LJ length and energy param-\neters, respectively and the subscript identifies the solvent.\nThe solvent parameters are typical for benzene, \u0003S=5 \u00c5 and\n\u0002S \/kB=414 K,25,26 which is a nonpolar solvent with a CED\nof around 3.5 katm and a fairly wide liquid range of around\n75 K \u0001278.7\u2013353.3 K\u0002.19,25\nThe pure liquid consists of a cube containing the solvent\nparticles initially arranged in a face-centered cubic \u0001fcc\u0002 lat-\ntice, in a volume V, at a density of 800 kg m\u22123, which is\napproximately 10% lower than the experimental density of\nliquid benzene. All simulations of the pure liquid and liquid-\ndimer mixture were performed at 293 K. Periodic boundary\nconditions were employed in the normal way and the LJ\npotentials were truncated at a cutoff rcut=2.5\u0003S with the\nusual LJ tail corrections applied.27 Equilibration of the pure\nliquid was achieved by allowing repeated isotropic contrac-\ntions for 106 time steps of 0.2 fs in the N-P-T ensemble\n\u0001constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature\u0002\nwith a zero pressure target. The system was then thermalized\nfurther in the N-V-E ensemble \u0001constant number of particles,\nvolume, and energy\u0002 using the cell dimensions obtained from\nthe N-P-T thermalization and equilibration was verified by\nensuring that there was no systematic drift in pressure. This\nprocedure produced a stable equilibrated liquid system at\nzero pressure with extremely small pressure fluctuations of\n\u00041 atm.\nThere are two methods for calculating the CED of the\nliquid from the simulation. The most straightforward ap-\nproach is to evaluate\nCEDS =\n\u2212 uS\nvS\n, \u00016\u0002\nwhere uS and vS are the mean configurational energy and\nvolume per solvent particle, respectively. An alternative ap-\nproach for the calculation of the CED examines the interac-\ntions between a particle and those particles in its immediate\nsurroundings. The effective CED due to the surrounding par-\nticles can be obtained by considering the breaking and for-\nmation of bonds when a particle is inserted into the liquid.\nSuppose each particle, on average, forms bonds to c neigh-\nboring particles, where c can be considered the coordination\nJOHN P.

In the LJ liquid we would expect c\u000712 for first\nnearest neighbors as for a fcc lattice.34 A cavity is formed by\nbreaking c \/2 bonds and then a particle is inserted into the\ncavity forming c bonds.

It is then\nevident that the configurational energy is given by\nuS = 2\u0005\u0006N\u000b\n0\n\b\nUSS\u0001r\u0002gSS\u0001r\u0002r2dr , \u00018\u0002\nwhere USS\u0001r\u0002 is the solvent-solvent LJ pair potential given by\nEq. \u00015\u0002 and the CED is obtained using Eq. \u00016\u0002. For a single-\nspecies liquid, the CED obtained using either Eq. \u00015\u0002 for the\nsystem as a whole or using Eq. \u00018\u0002 for the local CED should\nproduce the same result. Equation \u00018\u0002 can be adapted, how-\never, to estimate the effective local CED experienced by the\ndimer solute molecules as explained in the following\nsection.28\nB. Simulation of solvent-dimer mixture\nThis system consists of a binary mixture of ND=100 non-\npolar dimer solutes immersed in a NS=5984 particle LJ sol-\nvent. The intramolecular dimer bond is described by a Morse\npotential\nU\u0001r\u0002 = E0\u0001\f1 \u2212 exp\r\u2212 k\u0001r \u2212 r0\u0002\u000e\u000f2 \u2212 1\u0002 , \u00019\u0002\nwith parameters that are typical of those used to model the\nsingle O-O bond in hydrogen peroxide which is liquid at\nroom temperature: E0=50 kcal mol\u22121, r0=1.468 \u00c5, and k\n=1.375 \u00c5\u22121.29,30\nThe solvent-solvent interaction pair potential and param-\neters in the mixture are the same as those of the pure fluid\npresented in the previous section. For solvent-solute interac-\ntions, the dimer is treated as two-site and the interaction\nbetween a solvent particle and each dimer site is modeled as\nLJ \u000112\u20136\u0002 but modified by a parameter x that scales the at-\ntractive term:\nUSD\u0001r\u0002 = 4\u0002X\t\u0005\u0003X\nr\n\u000612 \u2212 x\u0005\u0003X\nr\n\u00066\n , \u000110\u0002\nwhere \u0003X and \u0002X are the LJ length and energy parameters,\nrespectively, for the solute-solvent interactions and are con-\nstants independent of x. This expression may be rewritten in\nthe form\nUSD\u0001r\u0002 = 4\u0002SD\u0001x\u0002\t\u0005\u0003SD\u0001x\u0002\nr\n\u000612 \u2212 \u0005\u0003SD\u0001x\u0002\nr\n\u00066\n , \u000111\u0002\nsuch that\n\u0003SD\u0001x\u0002 = \u0003Xx\u22121\/6, \u000112\u0002\n\u0002SD\u0001x\u0002 = x2\u0002X, \u000113\u0002\nthus satisfying the requirement that the repulsive component\nof the solvent-solute potential is a constant. Since the\nsolvent-solvent length and energy parameters are fixed, any\nvariation in x represents a variation in the energy and length\nparameters associated with the solute only. For the solvent-\nsolute parameters we expect the Lorentz-Berthelot mixing\nrules to hold, thus30\n\u0003SD\u0001x\u0002 =\n1\n2\n\r\u0003S + \u0003D\u0001x\u0002\u000e , \u000114\u0002\n\u0002SD\u0001x\u0002 = \r\u0002S\u0002D\u0001x\u0002\u000e1\/2, \u000115\u0002\nwhere each dimer site, or atom, has energy and length pa-\nrameters \u0002D\u0001x\u0002 and \u0003D\u0001x\u0002, respectively, assigned oxygen-\noxygen LJ interaction parameters for the case x=1. Hence\n\u0003D\u0001x=1\u0002=2.95 \u00c5 and \u0002D\u0001x=1\u0002 \/kB=61.6 K.31 Also, in Eq.\n\u000110\u0002, \u0002X=\u0002SD\u0001x=1\u0002 \/kB=159.7 K and \u0003SD\u0001x=1\u0002=3.98 \u00c5.\nThese choices lead to the solvent-solute LJ parameters listed\nin Table I. Note that there are no solute-solute intermolecular\ninteractions.\nFor simulations of the mixture, 6084 solvent particles\nwere arranged in a fcc lattice and 100 were replaced with\ndimers. Starting with x=1, equilibration began with repeat\nN-P-T-N-V-T cycles for 106 time steps of 0.2 fs which pro-\nduced simulation cells containing the mixture at a range of\npressure from about 0 to 1.2 katm. In order to obtain systems\nwith different values of x at approximately the same volume\nand hence density, the equilibrated system with x=1 was\nequilibrated for a new x in the N-V-T ensemble for 5\t106\ntime steps of 0.2 fs and then in the N-V-E ensemble for a\nmaximum of 3\t106 time steps of 0.2 fs. As before, equili-\nbration was verified and the simulation terminated when\nthere was no pressure or bond length drift.\nEach cell was then simulated using the N-V-E ensemble\nfor a maximum of 2\t106 time steps of 0.2 fs with the ther-\nmodynamic data and atomic positions recorded every 25\ntime steps. Dimer bond length measurements were obtained\nby averaging the individual bond length measurements of the\n100 dimers over all recorded time steps. The pressure and\nbond length data were monitored throughout each run and\nfor the mixture equilibration was verified and the simulation\nterminated when there was no systematic drift in pressure or\nbond length. Each cell was then taken through a cycle of four\nTABLE I.

The stan-\ndard deviation of the pressure and temperature fluctuations\nwas typically 0.015 katm and 1.5 K, respectively. It is also\nnoted that the use of the N-V-E ensemble at the data taking\nstage is essential as the normal thermostat \u0001Nos\u00e9-Hoover\u0002 for\nN-V-T ensembles scales the atomic velocities and the normal\nbarostat \u0001Berendsen\u0002 for N-P-T ensembles scales the volume\nand hence bond lengths. Both ensembles therefore interfere\nwith the quantities we wish to measure.\nBy definition, a dimer as vapor will have a CED of zero\nand does not experience a solvation pressure. Thus, we can\ntest for the validity of the solvation pressure model by com-\nparing bond lengths obtained from liquid and vapor simula-\ntions. We modeled the vapor by placing a single dimer in a\ncubic simulation cell with the same dimensions as the liquid,\nwhich meant that the cell was sufficiently large to render\nnegligible any interactions between the molecule and its im-\nages due to periodic boundary conditions. To obtain the va-\npor bond length, we averaged the bond length obtained from\n103 simulations undertaken, at zero pressure and 293 K, us-\ning the N-V-E ensemble for 107 time steps of 0.02 fs.\nThe CED experienced by a dimer due to its local environ-\nment can be obtained by considering the bonds broken in the\nformation of a cavity and the bonds formed when a dimer is\ninserted in the manner described in Sec. II B. Here, however,\nc \/2 solvent-solvent bonds are broken in forming the cavity\nand 2c solute-solvent bonds are formed when the dimer is\ninserted.

This integral cutoff incorporates the second\nshell in the energy calculations and consequently reduces the\nerror since the interaction energy due to all neighbors beyond\nthe second shell contributes only about 1.8% of the total.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe zero pressure density of the pure fluid determined\nfrom the simulation was 871.7 kg m\u22123. Using Eq. \u00016\u0002, we\ncalculated a solvent cohesive energy density of\n2.3\u00040.3 katm. This is in excellent agreement with the CED\nof 2.2 katm obtained using Eq. \u00018\u0002 for both the pure fluid and\nfluid component of the mixture. For the pure fluid we calcu-\nlated the volume per solvent particle from V \/N, while for the\nmixture we calculated this quantity using\nvS =\nV\nNS + XSND\n, \u000118\u0002\nwhere NS and ND are the number of solvent and solute par-\nticles in the system, respectively, and XS is the mole fraction\nof the solvent equal to 0.968.\nFigure 1 shows the average normalized dimer bond length\nas a function of applied pressure for various values of x. Also\nshown is the vapor bond length and since this bond will not\nexperience the solvation pressure felt by the liquid, we plot it\nat \u20132.3 katm, equal to the CED of the solvent. All dimer\nbond lengths were normalized to the vapor bond length\nwhich was equal to 1.477 \u00c5. Typically, the standard devia-\ntion of the bond length fluctuations was 5\t10\u22124 \u00c5 for the\nliquid and 10\u22123 \u00c5 for the vapor. The applied pressure is\nconfined to a maximum of about 1.2 katm to avoid the\nliquid-solid transition which occurs at higher densities.\nAs expected, Fig. 1 shows that the mean dimer bond\nlength decreases as the attractive component of the solvent-\nsolute potential, characterized by x, is increased. The dashed\nline, obtained from the linear regression of the liquid data\nonly for the case where x=1, passes through the vapor data\nwithin the error and it appears that it is only for this value of\nx, or narrow range of values either side of x=1, that the\nbehavior of the bond length is consistent with the solvation\npressure model. In other words, the application of a uniform\nhydrostatic pressure compresses the dimer bond length in the\nsame manner as the solvation pressure acting on the liquid at\nnormal pressure compared to the vapor.\nFor x=0, 0.5, 1, and 2.1 there is a linear compression of\nthe bond with increasing hydrostatic pressure and all plots\nexhibit a similar slope. However, this is not so when x=3\nand 4 where we observe an increase in bond length as the\napplied pressure is increased. The simple LJ system reveals\nmany of the complex features observed in experiments\nwhere bond length changes are inferred from the shift of\nRaman peaks with applied uniform pressure.

The expressions for the\nlocal CED given by Eqs. \u000116\u0002 and \u000117\u0002 include contributions\nfrom the rdf and dimer volume.\nFigure 2 shows the solvent-solvent \u0001SS\u0002 and solvent-\nsolute \u0001SD\u0002 rdfs as a function of x. As x is increased the first\npeak in the solvent-solute rdfs becomes taller but narrower,\nwhich suggests a reduction in the first coordination number\naccompanied by tighter packing in the cybotactic region. A\nlow and narrow second peak close to the first develops which\nbecomes more prominent for increasing x.

The latter confirms that the\nfirst coordination number is about 12, consistent with a fcc\nstructure due to a compact liquid. For the solvent-solute co-\nordination number at x=0, we find that c1\u001012, and from\nthere we observe a decrease of c1 for increasing x, consistent\nwith the splitting of the first peak in the rdfs. As x is in-\ncreased, first shell particles are squeezed and some are forced\nout leaving a highly compact cybotactic region. For small x,\nthe solvent-solute first coordination number increases\nslightly with pressure consistent with an uniform compres-\nsion of the system. However, for x=3 and x=4, c1 is constant\nand independent of pressure thus suggesting a lower limit to\nc1 of about 5.\nRecall that the bond length data presented in Fig. 1 show\nthat there are masking effects that alter the net solvation\npressure experienced by the solute bond, which results in\nbond behavior different from that expected for a fit to the\nsolvation pressure model. We have also demonstrated using\nrdfs and first coordination numbers that increasing the attrac-\ntive component of the solvent-solute potential modifies sig-\nnificantly the solvent structure within the cybotactic region.\nTo demonstrate further the extent of structural reorganization\nwe adopt a method similar to that used by Laaksonen et al.32\nto obtain the structural density function, or local structure,\nsurrounding a molecule. We first translate each dimer so that\nits center sits at the origin and then apply rotational matrices\nto align the bond length along the x axis. An equivalent\ntranslation and rotation is then applied to solvent particles\noriginally falling within a radial distance of r\nrcut from the\ncenter of the dimer. Over the course of a simulation we\nrecord solvent positions relative to the origin or center of the\ndimer bond, and obtain two-dimensional x-y and y-z slices of\nthe solvent structure surrounding the dimer by restricting the\nrecording of solvent positions where \u22120.05 \u00c5\u000bz\u000b0.05 \u00c5\nand \u22120.05 \u00c5\u000bx\u000b0.05 \u00c5, respectively.

Figures 4 and 5 confirm that there is significant\nstructural reorganization of solvent molecules surrounding\nthe solute for large x.\nWe now turn our attention to the dimer volume. As x is\nincreased, \u0003SD\u0001x\u0002 decreases and solvent particles move\ncloser to the solute sites. Thus, the local packing environ-\nment of the dimer is altered and the volume occupied by the\ndimer is reduced leading to an increase in the local solvation\npressure according to Eq. \u000117\u0002.\nCalculating free volumes in liquids has proved a difficult\ntask partly due to the computational and experimental diffi-\nculties associated with measuring and characterizing them.\nAlthough Krekellberg et al.33 have developed a model that\npredicts how the attractive strength affects the free volume\ndistributions of a square-well fluid with short range interac-\ntions, here an elementary model is used which assumes that\nthe dimer occupies a prolate ellipsoid with major and minor\naxes as illustrated in the x-y and y-z slices, respectively.\nIf the minor and major axes are R1 and R2, respectively,\nthen\nvD =\n4\u0005\n3\n\u0001R1\n2R2\u0002 , \u000119\u0002\nwhere R1 is the distance from the dimer axis to the first peak\nof the rdf and R2=R1+d \/2 where d is the dimer bond length.\nFigure 6 confirms that the dimer volume vD decreases for\nincreasing x at zero applied pressure.

For small x,\nCEDX is negative; for example, at x=1, CEDX\u0010\u22120.2 katm.\nYet, at x=1, the behavior of the dimer bond length is consis-\ntent with the solvation pressure model and compliance with\nthe model implies that at zero applied pressure the bond\nshould experience a CED equivalent to that of the solvent\nCED, namely, about 2.3 katm. Broad agreement with the\nSPM, within bond length error, was obtained for approxi-\nmately 0.7\u000bx\u000b1.6, which corresponds to a range of solva-\ntion pressure \u22120.3\u000bCEDX\u000b1.4\u0001katm\u0002 in Fig. 7, well below\nthe solvent CED. Note that the calculation of CEDX includes\nthe effect of both the reduced dimer volume with increasing\nx and also changes to the local environment characterized by\nthe rdf. The negative CED obtained in the low x regime is\nbecause the solvent-solute interactions are dominated by the\nrepulsive component and so the affinity of solvent with sol-\nute is lower than the solvent-solute interactions. We note that\nother workers have used dilution to generate negative solva-\ntion pressures in liquids8 and state that these arise because\npressure and dilution change the environment around solute\nmolecules.34\nAt low x, CEDX is dominated by the energy of cavity\ncreation, or break up of solvent-solvent bonds, while for\nhigher x it is the solute solvation that dominates due to the\nincreasing strength of the attractive component of the\nsolvent-solute potential. For x\f1, there is both a positive\nCED and the increasing strength of the solvent-solute inter-\naction leads to significant structural reorganization of solvent\nparticles, a lower free volume, and hence a packing effect\nthat dominates the bond behavior. At x\u00102, CEDX corre-\nsponds with the CED of the solvent. The fact that CEDX\nincreases with increasing x suggests that the CED is a real\npressure that plays a role in the observed bond compression.\nHowever, what is striking is that in our simplified system\nthere is evidence of masking interactions that cause the bond\nlength to deviate significantly from the simple solvent solva-\ntion pressure dependence. It would therefore be useful to\ncompare CEDX with a direct calculation of the pressure ex-\nerted on the bond determined from the net axial force.\nThe net axial force fAXIAL is obtained by summing the\nbond-lengthening and bond-shortening force components\ndue to solvent molecules lying within a distance r\nrcut of\nthe dimer where a positive or negative net force corresponds\nto a net shortening or lengthening force, respectively. In or-\nder to calculate a net axial pressure, it is reasonable to as-\nsume that fAXIAL acts on a net area of \u0005\r\u0003SD\u0001x\u0002 \/2\u000e2. Thus the\nnet axial pressure at a given x is\nPAXIAL =\nfAXIAL\n\u0005\r\u0003SD\u0001x\u0002\/2\u000e2\n\u000120\u0002\nand these values are included on Fig. 7. A quadratic fit to\nPAXIAL provides a good fit and indicates that the zero pres-\nsure net axial force, and hence bond length, may be domi-\nnated by the energy parameter since \u0002SD\bx2.\nFigure 7 suggests that the pressure mechanism controlling\nthe bond behavior may be attributed to the internal pressure\nrather than the CED or solvation pressure. Evidence comes\nfrom Eq. \u00014\u0002 which showed that in liquids where masking\ninteraction dominate pi\u000bCED which is similar to the behav-\nior seen here where PAXIAL\u000bCEDX. We note that the dimer\nbond behavior appears to fit the solvation pressure model at\nx\u00101 which is where, as shown in Fig. 7, CEDX\u0010PAXIAL.\nFinally, we explain the pressure dependence of the bond\nlengths for large x shown in Fig. 1. For x\u000b2.1 the bond\nlengths show an approximate linear decrease for increasing\napplied pressure while for x=3 and 4 the bond lengths are\nlengthened with applied pressure, at least for small applied\npressures.\nFigures 8\u201310 present the CEDX, dimer volume, and\nPAXIAL, respectively, as functions of uniform hydrostatic\npressure for x=4. The applied pressure promotes changes in\nthe solvent structure that lead to a systematic increase in free\nvolume but the change in volume is too small to significantly\naffect the value of CEDX. The CEDX shows a small drop in\nvalue with increasing applied pressure up to a pressure of\nabout 0.2 katm before increasing once more. However, it is\nPAXIAL which shows a significant fall with increasing applied\npressure consistent with the increase in bond length observed\nin Fig. 1. The lengthening of the bond is similar to the bond\nbehavior observed in liquids where masking interactions are\nevident due to the presence of hydrogen bonds. The theoret-\nical calculation of the axial pressure would be complex be-\ncause it depends on the specific positions of the solvent par-\nticles in the cybotactic region.

CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we examine the effect of solvation pressure\non a simple nonpolar dimer immersed in a Lennard-Jones\nfluid via molecular dynamics simulation. The solvated dimer\nacts as a pressure gauge in a system where the solvation\npressure of the solvent is constant and we have attempted to\nisolate the general solvation pressure by simplification of the\npotentials. The dimer bond length is measured as a function\nof x, which scales the attractive component of the solvent-\nsolute interaction potential, and as a function of applied uni-\nform hydrostatic pressure. While ostensibly a simple system,\nour results exhibited rich behavior similar to that observed\nexperimentally, using Raman spectroscopy, for a range of\nsolute-solvent systems including those where hydrogen\nbonding is known to be a dominant factor in bond length\nbehavior.8\u201310 We found that for x\u00101, the observed bond be-\nhavior is consistent with the solvation pressure model but\nwith the caveat that neither the effective local CED nor the\naxial pressure indicate that the pressure experienced by the\ndimer was that expected for compliance with the model.\nFor weak attractive solvent-solute interactions x\u000b1 we\nfind that the dimer bond is compressed with applied pressure\nas the mean positions of the surrounding solvent particles\ndraw closer to the dimer. We calculate that the dimer expe-\nriences a negative local CED but a positive net axial force\nand axial pressure at x=1. We conclude that in the low x\nregime the bond behavior is dominated by repulsive solvent-\nsolute interactions. For x\f1, attractive solvent-solute inter-\nactions dominate and this leads to significant structural reor-\nganization of solvent particles surrounding the dimer solutes\nin which the number of first-nearest neighbors is reduced and\na second peak in the rdf appears. At x=3 and x=4, the dimer\nbond is found to lengthen with applied pressure. This is due\nto the subtle structural changes where first-nearest neighbors\nare squeezed out leading to a reduction in the axial pressure.\nInformation about the specific positions of the local solvent\nparticles is required to correctly predict this behavior and this\neffect is only partially revealed by the CED which averages\nover the local particle density. The high x regime corre-\nsponds to a positive CED, axial force, and axial pressure and\nwe conclude that here the bond length behavior is dominated\nby attractive solvent-solute interactions and the consequent\npacking restrictions or so called \u201cpacking effect.\u201d An in-\ncrease in dimer bond length with applied pressure is indica-\ntive of strong, attractive forces and local structure and is\nconsistent with experimental observations in hydrogen-\nbonded systems.9\nAlthough the main aim of this study is to test the validity\nof the solvation pressure model, and hence ubiquitous nature\nof solvation pressure, we emphasize that all the conclusions\ndrawn have been tested on the LJ system only. Other work\nworth noting is a study of how the attractive potential influ-\nences the structuring of spheres which demonstrated that co-\nhesion between atoms is enormously important to structure\nand is of greater significance than first realized.35 Also,\nKodaka36,37 has reported that there is a correlation between\nthe diameter of solvents and packing density and that the\nformer tends to increase depending on the magnitude of CED\nat constant temperature and pressure. Furthermore, that hy-\ndrophobicity is caused by the packing density of water \u0001or\norganic solvents such as ethylene glycol\u0002 being higher than\nthat expected for a solvent with the same size and lower\nCED. Therefore, it will be interesting to see whether the\n\u201cpacking effect\u201d that we have observed at high x has the\npronounced effect on bond behavior in real systems that we\nhave shown to be the case for the LJ system.\nIn conclusion, results suggest that the bond behavior\nshould be attributed to the net axial pressure, or internal pres-\nsure, rather than the cohesive energy density. We also found\nthat the dimer bond behavior appears to give a fit to the\nsolvation pressure model at x\u00101, which is the value of x for\nwhich CEDX\u0010PAXIAL. The solvation pressure model does\nnot, in general, correctly describe the change in bond length\nfrom vapor to liquid except for a specific and limited ranges\nof x. Our results do not support the idea that our simple\npressure gauge, the dimer, experiences a ubiquitous applied\npressure equivalent to the CED of the solvent. That is, the\nsolvation pressure model has limited validity in our simpli-\nfied system where we have attempted to isolate the general\nsolvation pressure by using simple LJ potentials.\nThese results should aid the interpretation of experiments\nin which the bond lengths within solute molecules are in-\nferred from changes in Raman mode frequencies as a func-\ntion of applied pressure and hence provide an insight into the\nnature of the specific solute-solvent interactions in real sys-\ntems.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nJ.
