Having its origins in Electronic Commerce, the system assumes the existence of a\ncertain kind of user, one with particular roles and responsibilities\u2014a self-service user. The\nnotion of \u2018self-service\u2019 is deployed as an integral part of the system rollout where students are\nto view, input and modify administrative and financial information on themselves and their\ncourses. Drawing from the sociology of science and technology, and material from a 3-year\nethnographic study, we describe the system\u2019s implementation in a British university. While\naccepting of the need for an ERP system the campus community reject self-service. However, as\nwe will show, because Campus Management is a \u2018global product\u2019 unwanted functionality can\nbe difficult to resist outright and this can have important implications for the autonomy of the\nuniversity and the reshaping of fundamental principles and relationships.\nKeywords: self-service technologies, universities, student identity, enterprise-wide\ncomputer systems.\nIntroduction\nIf we say that we want students to [self-administer], and because they do these\nthings for us, we have to treat them in a different way. It is similar to the\nexample of \u2018Smile\u2019 Internet banking and the way they are blurring the\nboundary between \u2018customer\u2019 and \u2018cashier\u2019.2\nUniversities are unlike many other organisations in that they are said to be\ngoverned by a number of shared principles, some of the most important of which\nare their right to self-determination in deciding how they operate and function,\ntheir autonomy in setting their aims, and their responsibility and duty of care to\ntheir students.3 Presumably, to the extent that these principles still hold,\nuniversities must work to maintain them whilst at the same time taking account of102 N. Pollock\nnew and sometimes conflicting pressures. Some of these pressures, as described in\nRonald Barnett\u2019s important book Realizing the University in an Age of Supercomplexity,4\ninclude the need to find new sources of income, to engage with new constituencies,\naudiences and knowledge, for the university to function efficiently and flexibly, and\nto become a much more modern form of organisation.5 This latter goal is\nparticularly interesting as it appears to be at odds with the historical status of\nuniversities which until relatively recently were, as Barnett describes, \u2018devoid of\nlarge-scale organisational characteristics\u2019.6 This poses intriguing questions for\nacademics and managers alike: how does an institution (seemingly without much in\nthe way of one) create for itself a greater level of organisation, what will this\norganisation look like, and what are the implications for foundational principles,\nrelationships and responsibilities?\nFor some institutional managers a part solution to what is becoming known as\na  \u2018crisis\u20197 is to be found in new forms of administrative and organisational\ncomputer systems, especially those used by large commercial firms. We focus on\nwhat are known as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and the various\norganisational philosophies that accompany them. This software promises the\nkinds of flexibility, efficiency and organisational \u2018templates\u2019 that are increasingly\ndesired by universities.8 Yet if seen as part of the solution to the \u2018organisational\nissue\u2019 they are also part of the problem. In order to bring about the kind of changes\nrequired they demand a large scale re-engineering of institutional practices. They\nalso assume the existence of certain kinds of users with specific roles and\nresponsibilities towards the support of the newly reconfigured institution. We\nconsider how a British university\u2014whom we are calling \u2018Red Brick\u2019\u2014is attempting\nto adopt such a system. The aim of the project is to shift the university from a\nprofessionally supported administrative culture to one which is increasingly\ncomputer supported and self-managed. The eventual plan being that all staff and\nstudents will become \u2018active\u2019 users of the new system with responsibilities for the\nupkeep of their own administrative records, which they will access and manage on\na \u2018self-service\u2019 basis.\nSelf-service philosophies, the principle focus of this article, while seemingly\nappropriate for the challenges facing a modern organisation do not as yet exist\nwithin this institution. Bringing the self-service user \u2018into being\u2019 will therefore\nrequire changes in organisation and thinking. In the first part of the article, we\ndescribe arguments deployed by system advocates as well as some of the resistances\nto these proposals. In the second part, we focus on the development of \u2018Campus\nManagement\u2019, a new module being built by the ERP supplier specifically for the\nmanagement and administration of students. This module is being developed\naround the needs of Red Brick and a number of other \u2018pilot sites\u2019, with the\nsupplier\u2019s eventual aim to launch it as a \u2018global product\u2019. We show how the\nadoption of the new module has implications for the reshaping of organisational\npractices and relationships.\nThe study can be located within two, as yet, unrelated literatures, one that\nconsiders the future of universities, and a second concerned with the design,\ndevelopment and implementation of information & communication technologies\n(ICTs), the sociology of science and technology. While the former is concerned\nwith the application of new technologies, much of this writing fails to provide a\nsense of where these technologies come from and how they are adopted (or\ncontested, resisted and deflected) by their intended audience. Also, it tends to\nportray technologies in a simplistic way, as instruments that simply add or detractThe \u2018Self-service\u2019 Student 103\nfrom universities. Through discussing insights from the latter literature we hope to\nshow the variety of outcomes possible through the deployment of ERP systems. We\nanalyse the notion of self-service and locate it within recent developments within\nelectronic-commerce. The subsequent section describes some of the reasons why\nself-service has become popular among universities. The institution where our case\nstudy was carried out is then described, including a brief review of its strategies for\nthe procurement of administrative computer systems. The discussion then focuses\non Campus Management and the reactions of senior managers and academics to\nproposed changes to student administration. Finally, we discuss how other\nuniversities involved in the Campus Management project are able to shape the\nsystem and ultimately Red Brick\u2019s own organisation.\nUnderstanding Technological Change in Universities\nBefore we discuss the introduction of new ICTs into universities we should say a\nlittle about what we understand the university as an organisation to be. The\ntraditional university is conventionally, if mythically, thought of as a band of\nscholars coming together in pursuit and dissemination of knowledge, governed\nby a more or less collegiate model of organisation, based around a complex\nstructure of committees and with a high degree of individual and departmental\nautonomy. In this sense, the university as an organisation tends to lack a clear\nidentity, primarily existing in the heads of people who constitute it and a myriad\nof locally negotiated practices and interactions. In organisational terms, it has\nthus been described as an exemplar of a \u2018loosely coupled system\u20199 characterised\nby a lack of clearly articulated policy and weak control over the implementation\nof policy.10 The traditional university, then, and this is what Barnett is referring\nto, often appears to be only virtually present.11 It is important to also note that\nthe university is best described as \u2018ambivalent\u2019 about change. By this we mean\nthat institutions have proven to be highly flexible and responsive (in particular to\nfinancial incentives from government) and, at the same time, highly rigid and\nresistant to organisational innovation (particularly where founding principles are\nthreatened). How has this odd, sometimes contrasting position been reflected in\nthe literature on ICTs?\nIn truth, it has not in any serious way. Much of the writing on universities tends\nto be future orientated, structured around questions about what the implications of\nthe technology will be rather than on empirical studies.12 Much of this work\noverlaps with the more general debate on the \u2018future of the university\u2019, both of\nwhich generally give a large degree of influence to the capacities of the new\ntechnologies.13 As a result, one seldom gets a sense of where these artefacts come\nfrom, how they are shaped, the processes by which they are built into institutions,\nor the variety of outcomes that might arise as they are deployed within the\n(ambivalent) institution of the university. In many accounts, ICTs are seen to simply\npreserve and reproduce the existing organisation, what Feenberg has described as\nthe \u2018principle of the conservation of the hierarchy\u2019, or they undermine or bypass\nexisting institutional forms, what he has called the \u2018principle of subversive\nrationalisation\u2019.14 Only occasionally are they described as doing both. Barnet, to\ngive one example of this latter type, argues that the Internet and email are a\nsignificant element in accentuating, if not actually causing the attenuation of\nuniversities and of destroying their \u2018defining centre\u2019.15 ICTs in this sense are\npresented as unified and monolithic.16104 N. Pollock\nOur concern is to investigate how an institution constructs a new identity and\nresponsibilities for students, the response to proposed change, and the implica-\ntions that follow from such projects. To help us, we draw on the sociology of\nscience and technology, particularly a body of work that has considered the \u2018co-\nproduction\u2019 of technologies and society. According to this view, engineers,\ninnovators, technical specialists and the like are not simply concerned with\nmaking artefacts but will also construct a theory of society or social relations\nwhich their objects can be inserted into. Such a theory can be (and often is)\nradical, ranging from the depiction of large-scale social change, such as shifts in\nconsumption patterns, through to the characteristics of the users of the future\ntechnologies.17 This process is clearly described in an article by Madeleine Akrich\non the production of electricity generators for use by villagers in French\nPolynesia.18 Her argument is that the design of a technology simultaneously\nrequires the \u2018design of the user\u2019 and his or her environment. That is, a user\u2019s\nskill, their abilities and what the technology should do in relation to the user are\n\u2018scripted\u2019 into an artefact and this influences the generators\u2019 final shape. This is\nnot to say that it is a matter of simply outlining a better description of users.\nRather, according to Akrich, the \u2018user\u2019 does not pre-exist the technology but is\nactively constructed alongside the object. In other words, the introduction of the\ntechnology may well be intended to contribute to the construction of a new kind\nof user, one with different characteristics, roles, and responsibilities than before.\nYet, it is not that an artefact simply specifies the shape of the user and his or her\nenvironment. These scripts often fail, to a greater or lesser extent, to be\ntranslated into practice. Rather they are contested, resisted, deflected or\ncomplemented by other scripts developed by their intended audience and others.\nIn other words, technologies can often have a variety of outcomes, some of which\nare often not known or expected.\nMethodology\nThis article is developed from a 3-year ethnographic study of the application of\nenterprise-wide systems in universities. In terms of \u2018what\u2019 and \u2018who\u2019 we looked at\nduring our study we drew again on lessons from the sociology of science and\ntechnology. Bruno Latour has famously advocated that technologies should be\nstudied not as finished artefacts but \u2018in the making\u2019, arguing that, by studying them\nin this way, the \u2018messiness\u2019 is still there for all to see.19 By messiness, he means not\nonly those issues identified by the researcher but those that arise during the\nbuilding and implementation of such projects. We studied Campus Management as\nit was actually being built, tested and implemented. For this, we made use of direct\nand participant observation where we attended project meetings, away-days,\ncommittee meetings, user-feedback and brain-storming sessions, technical brief-\nings, presentations and, travelled overseas to observe interaction between the\nsoftware supplier and the universities acting as pilot sites for the technology under\ndevelopment. Moreover, Latour suggests \u2018following the actors\u2019, meaning those\ncentral to rolling out these technologies. These are not people identified by the\nresearchers but are those deemed relevant by those actually building the\ntechnologies. Here we spoke to senior university managers, external consultants,\nproject managers, practitioners, academics, administrators and support staff.\nDuring this research, some interviews were taped but extensive hand-written notes\nwere taken at most sessions.The \u2018Self-service\u2019 Student 105\nSelf-service: Where Did the Concept Come From?\nThe genesis of the notion of self-service is interesting and worth exploring. Though\nit is a relatively new concept in the world of computing it first became popular some\ntime ago with the work of the economist Jonathan Gershuny. In his book, After\nIndustrial Society? The Emerging Self-Service Economy, Gershuny contradicted the firmly\nheld belief at the time that industrialised countries were becoming \u2018service\neconomies\u2019.20 His counter-argument was that people were not in fact purchasing\nmore services, but rather consumers were investing in durable goods (such as\nwashing machines, cars, etc.) that would allow them to produce and consume\nservices for themselves. Self-service principles, as he saw it, were set to spread\nelsewhere leading to the growth of a \u2018post service\u2019 economy. One only has to look\nto the world of banking and the widespread adoption of Automatic Telling\nMachines (ATMs) to see examples of this phenomenon.21 More recently self-\nservice has become an important, albeit implicit, part of many of the \u2018dis-\nintermediation\u2019 arguments surrounding the growth of the Internet.22 Most\nstrikingly it has become part and parcel of much of the marketing rhetoric that\nsoftware suppliers deploy when selling and implementing their systems. As\ndeveloped by them it has become a dominant mode of use, one might even say\n\u2018organisational philosophy\u2019. We say organisational philosophy because, for suppli-\ners, it is not simply that self-service is seen to have economic benefits through\neasing basic administration processes but it is also described as having an\n\u2018emancipatory\u2019 aspect. According to some, having direct access to personal data is\nseen to \u2018empower\u2019 employees and give them greater \u2018control\u2019 over their careers:\nThe Employee Self Service solution consists of a set of easy-to-use applications\nthat empower employees to view, create, and maintain confidential personal\ndata over an intranet or the Internet (my emphasis).23\nIt is no secret that most companies introduce self-service technology for one\nprimary reason: it can save huge sums of money by eliminating unwieldy\nprocesses that devour time and resources. Of course, other benefits can result\nfrom employees taking control of their own transactions, including helping\nthem take greater responsibility and ownership of their careers (my\nemphasis).24\nOf course, while one should be wary of accepting the above claims at face value\n(see below), it is interesting to note that such a discourse is beginning to also\nbecome popular within higher education. Below, we analyse some of the reasons for\nthis.\nSelf-service Discourse and University Expansion\nThe self-service philosophy, along with the cost saving and emancipatory rhetoric,\nhas recently influenced organisational change strategies and computer systems\nimplementations within universities. Universities, perhaps more than other large\npublic institutions, are seen to benefit from self-service technologies\u2014along with\nCampus Management we know of many other similar projects underway.25 What is\ndriving the rapid diffusion of this vision? Firstly, and most significantly, there has\nbeen a shift from elite to mass higher education taking the form of increasingly106 N. Pollock\nlarge proportions of 18\u201320 years olds going on from secondary education to higher\neducation. This phenomenon, observed around the globe, has not been\naccompanied by a proportional increase in the funding of higher education.26 This\nhas led to a declining resource per student and a concomitant search by institutions\nfor efficiency gains.27 In other words, there has been little choice but to rethink\ntraditional methods of enrolling, registering and administering students. Secondly,\nand related to this, there is an increasing tension between the demands of teaching\nand research on the staff of the university. In this respect, the application of self-\nservice and ERP technologies is widely seen as offering the possibility of new\ndivisions of labour between different categories of individuals within the university.\nWork can be shifted from staff to students\u2014i.e. students can take on responsibility\nfor checking and maintaining some parts of their student records, relieving\nadministrative and academic staff of this task.28\nThirdly, there are not only economic motives driving this philosophy, students\nare increasingly seen as discerning clients with an increasingly wide experience of\nICT from the world of private services and from the spread of these technologies\nin the home and workplace. The incorporation of ICT spend per head figures into\nmany of the influential university rankings, for example, and is seen shaping the\nchoices of potential students. Here too the provision of online services is widely\nseen as \u2018helpful\u2019 to the image and recruitment appeal of the institution. For\nexample, students can complete registration details or pay bills online before\ncoming onto campus and thus avoid lengthy queues.29 Fourthly, students are\nincreasingly seen not just as clients of the university but also as a resource to be used\nby the institution. The clearest sign of this is in terms of regional engagement (e.g.\nstudent community action), and as alumni who may be persuaded to help to fund\nthe institution and who can provide valuable contacts for research and recruitment,\nas well as openings for new graduates.30 Institutions are therefore adopting a more\ninstitutional approach to their students and self-service is seen as an important tool\nin maximising this resource\u2014i.e. students should be taking more responsibility for\ntheir own administration.31\nAs well as the examples listed above, we attended a number of conferences\nwhere people involved in these kinds of projects outlined some of their thinking\nand strategies for self-service.32 One Project Manager, for instance, described how\nthe impetus for their system stemmed directly from his Vice Chancellor who saw\nself-service not simply in cost saving terms but as \u2018empowering the students to\nmanage their own learning more actively\u2019, and how the system was \u2018for students\u2019\nand \u2018not about students\u2019.33 Another Project Manager, in contrast, described how he\ndid not see self-service as part of a student centred educational philosophy but\nmore as a reflection of wider societal, business and technological shifts to self-\nservice formats (i.e. ATM, Internet shopping). In his view the Internet and\ncomputer systems like ERP offered universities a new way of \u2018doing business\u2019, where\nthere are a \u2018defined set of rules\u2019 that have the potential to radically reshape\nuniversity structures and to make them \u2018more like other organisations\u2019. Before\nturning to the empirical material, we note two further points. The turn to ERP is\na notable departure and above we have presented what might be described as\n\u2018external influences\u2019 for this. Below we describe the move in terms of conventional\ncomputing procurement and organisational change strategies. ERP systems\npromise large rewards, though like most ICTs they often fail to deliver the kind of\nservices expected by users. We also discuss the difficulties of implementing such\ntechnologies.34The \u2018Self-service\u2019 Student 107\nImplementing ERP: Promises and Difficulties\nWhile universities relied on \u2018in house\u2019 systems for basic management and\nadministration functions this has changed in recent years as a result of complaints\nabout the \u2018fragmented\u2019 and \u2018amateurish\u2019 nature of such systems. Here, some\ncommentators too have pointed to the ambivalent attitude of universities to\nchange. Universities, argue Bull et al., have been a central factor in the\ndevelopment and proliferation of modern computing but their attitude to\nadministration systems has been \u2018highly conservative\u2019:  \u2018. . . [m]any institutions\nmight lag behind the state-of-the-art of computing systems for more than one\ngeneration; others might not have computer support at all in one or other\nadministrative domain\u2019.35 There have been various initiatives to counter this\nsituation. For instance, there was the large and expensive University Funding\nCouncil sponsored \u2018Management & Administrative Computing (MAC)\u2019 project\nwhich began in the UK in 1988. This involved institutions forming into \u2018families\u2019 to\ncollaborate with software suppliers.36 In the eyes of many the MAC system was\nregarded as \u2018a failure\u2019: having been designed only months before important\nexternal changes in higher education it was seen as incapable of dealing with the\n\u2018organisational problem\u2019 that universities were increasingly seen to have.37\nRed Brick, who had been at the forefront of the MAC initiative, were amongst\nthe first to seek an alternative solution. They engaged the services of a well-known\ngroup of management consultants to carry out a review of their systems and they,\nin turn, recommended the procurement of a \u2018tried and tested\u2019 commercial system.\nA further benefit of a commercial system over a bespoke option was that it was\nseemingly \u2018future proof\u2019 in that suppliers were constantly updating their products\n(with new upgrades and modules) to account for the changing demands and needs\nof enterprises. Shortly afterwards a tender process was conducted with a large\nEuropean supplier being selected ahead of a number of other strong competitors.\nInterestingly, the successful bidder had no previous experience working with\nBritish universities (and only a small amount of experience with higher education\nin general) whereas other suppliers had significantly more experience (several\nhaving being involved in the MAC project, for instance). The rationale for this\nchoice given by senior managers was that this was the only supplier that had\nsuggested that the exercise should be treated not in a narrow, technical way but as\nan opportunity to restructure the university\u2019s entire business processes. This met\nwith approval as the managers were in the early stages of putting together such a\nplan to restructure and devolve much of the management and administration\nissues to departments and the system appeared to offer a useful template in\nstructuring such changes.\nWhile the procurement of such generic solutions is an increasing trend among\norganisations,38 it was not a popular decision throughout Red Brick. There were\nthose within the Central Administration who thought ERP systems were not\nappropriate to the workings of a university and foresaw problems particularly\naround the amount of upheaval required. There was a feeling that many of the\nbasic assumptions, categories and models embedded in the system would not\nnecessarily translate well across the boundary from large corporation to a higher\neducation institution.39 System advocates assured colleagues, however, that the\nsupplier  was committed to re-developing its software and this would include\ntailoring existing modules, and where needs could not be met within the current\noffering, the development of new software, which would include Campus108 N. Pollock\nManagement. These tensions, however, were not resolved and remained through-\nout the life span of the project (see below).\nCampus Management\nThe actual selection of the student management system was conducted under the\nauspices of the wider ERP project. As we have said, the supplier was offering to\ndevelop the Campus Management module and to allow Red Brick access to this\nprocess as one of a number of \u2018pilot sites\u2019. From Red Brick\u2019s point of view, they were\nbeing presented with a unique opportunity to shape what would become a global\nsoftware package. Moreover, in return for their co-operation it was agreed that the\nsupplier would meet all the software and some implementation costs. There\nappeared to be little point in looking at other products. Although some evaluation\nof alternative student systems was carried out, this was by no means extensive. On\nthe project website it was described as a \u2018pioneering\u2019 development between a well-\nrespected software supplier and several prestigious universities from around the\nworld. Moreover, it described how its plan was to merge Campus Management with\nthe other ERP modules already installed, meaning that not only would Red Brick\nbe among the first to rollout the Campus Management module but also it would be\nthe first to have a fully integrated \u2018university ERP solution\u2019.\nBuilding Students into the System\nComputer systems are well known to disrupt established divisions of labour.40 What\nwas notable about previous systems (like MAC) was that they were kept within the\ndomain of the centralised administration and had little influence on the primary\nfunctions of universities and their workforce. Most academic staff rarely came into\ndirect contact and students were barely (if at all) aware of their existence, their\nrelationship to administrative systems having until now being mediated by\nacademic and support staff. Under Campus Management, however, students are to\nmove from being \u2018passive\u2019 objects of administration to one of the main groups of\n\u2018active\u2019 users. In doing so they will be expected to do many different things for\nthemselves: they will self-register for certain aspects of their degree course; they will\nvalidate the accuracy of other information (e.g. academic results, financial status\nand so on); eventually students will be able to pay bills on-line; book accommoda-\ntion; and schedule meetings with their tutors and so on. It will be possible to do all\nthese things without physically coming onto the campus. Moreover, it is not only\nthat students will be taking on new data inputting tasks, a job currently done by\nuniversity staff, but they will also be responsible for the timeliness and accuracy of\nthe data contained in their student record.\nThe work required to bring about these new divisions of labour is considerable,\nrequiring effort at the level of both software and institution. Technically speaking\nthe project appeared to pose few problems for the supplier. Having promised to\nbuild a university-specific system they were in fact proposing to use a reworked\nversion of two existing ERP modules, the Training and Events Management\nModule, a system used to run internal training programmes within firms, and the\nReal Estate module. These modules, however, are structured around commercial\ncategories (like supplier, employee, and customer) and there is no notion of \u2018the\nstudent\u2019 within the system. Therefore, this new category had to be created. There\nis not the space here to describe the fascinating process where the supplierThe \u2018Self-service\u2019 Student 109\nattempts to works out the nature of \u2018students\u2019 and some of their differences from\nexisting categories.41 Just as the notion of the student has to be built into the\nsoftware, it also had to be created within the institution. Here again the process is\nnot straightforward, as the relationship of the university to the student is a complex\none.\nOver time, the relationship has been characterised as something akin to the one\nan \u2018apprentice\u2019 might have with his or her \u2018master\u2019. In the same vein, a student has\nbeen seen as a \u2018ward\u2019 of the university placed there by parents or society. More\nrecently, students have been seen as members (albeit junior ones) of the institution\nwith rights to serve on committees and in some cases help shape university decision\nmaking. Today they are commonly viewed as an institution\u2019s \u2018customers\u2019 or as the\n\u2018consumers\u2019 of higher education.42 Despite the prominence of this latter view, no\none relationship fully dominates and the legacies of all previous relationships are\nstill found (however small). This begs the question as to how self-service might fit\nwithin this rather complicated relationship. Below we describe two facets of this\nattempt to reconfigure the student\u2013university relation (the creation of new\nexpectations concerning registration processes and building of responsibilities\ntowards information). Finally we note some of the tensions that arise as the various\nlegacies butt up against each other.\nQueuing and Confusion\nInternally, there was a widespread recognition that many of the processes relating\nto student management and administration were in need of updating. This is in\nkeeping with considerations generally that yearly enrolment or registration\nprocesses where students queue for hours in large halls to complete paperwork that\ncould be completed elsewhere (i.e. over the Internet prior to travelling to\nuniversity) are no longer acceptable. While for some the \u2018queuing and confusion\u2019\nthat one meets when arriving at university for the first time is an important facet of\n\u2018becoming a student\u2019,43 for others there is an increasing awareness that such\nfrustrations should be minimised given the changing demands of students as\n\u2018critical consumers\u2019. An internal document outlines this reorientation and move to\na \u2018service culture\u2019:\nStudent tuition charges, possible top-up fees and vouchers are fuelling\nincreased student expectations and prompting the move to a service culture.\nStudents are no longer willing to stand in long queues to register or order\ntranscripts nor are they happy to travel between different offices across the\ncampus to deal with programme registration, housing applications or payment\nof fees. Universities that can offer these functions (and others) on-line via self-\nservice to an integrated information system will gain a competitive advantage\n(Red Brick Internal Report).\nOf course, what is being articulated here are concerns for consumerism that\nhave been typical of American higher education from the 1970s and that have been\nincreasingly appearing on UK campuses since the late 1990s. There is no need to\nrehearse this debate, as the implications of this are well understood. It is sufficient\nto say that one aspect relevant to our discussion is that students as customers are\nnow commonly seen to have new rights. According to Silver and Silver, these can be\ndescribed as \u2018the delivery of services promised\u2019, \u2018appropriate forms of services\u2019 and110 N. Pollock\na \u2018greater access to information\u2019.44 Important to note here is that self-service access\nappears to correspond with the need to fulfil these rights, and at Red Brick there\nwas an emphasis on achieving this through encouraging access to and ownership of\ninformation.\nOwnership of Information\nA common complaint throughout Red Brick was that no single person or\ndepartment had \u2018ownership\u2019 of information and, therefore, those inputting data\nwere not concerned with its accuracy. Accuracy was increasingly important given\nthe new demands placed upon the university to report and manage its activities as\nwell as provide efficient services for its students.45 The resolution of this problem\nappeared to reside with self-service technologies and shifting responsibility for the\nownership of data to those who could ensure its accuracy\u2014namely students. This\nview is by no means restricted to Red Brick and can be found in good practice\nguides to institutional management in higher education:\nThe best systems ensure that those who need to rely on the data are also those\nresponsible for ensuring the accuracy of the data: it is of little use if, for\nexample, entry of student fee information is a low priority for that part of the\ninstitution which enters it, or if, on the other hand, tutors who need accurate\ncourse and module lists feel that it is not their responsibility to take registers\nof attendance. This \u2018ownership\u2019 of the data is crucial.46\nThe author of the good practice guide argues that in terms of student\ninformation the best \u2018owners\u2019 are seen to be students themselves as: \u2018. . . they have\nmost to lose if their records are wrong, and ought to be placed in a position not\nonly to change any inaccurate data easily but also to be required to ensure that they\nare changed. ..\u2019.47 The suggestion is that students should become \u2018responsible\u2019 for\nthe accuracy of all information the university might hold about them. Similar sets\nof aims were driving Campus Management. The university\u2019s \u2018Communication and\nInformation Strategy\u2019, for instance, includes the following objective:\nTo provide staff and students with access to information appropriate to their\nneeds by a wide variety of information sources. .. All information should have\nowners who are responsible for up-to-date accuracy of that information . . .\nIn a further discussion document concerning Campus Management it is\ndescribed how students\u2019 could and should have direct, real access to their \u2018...  o w n\npersonal and academic data\u2019. On top of this, it is suggested that students should\nalso be able to input and modify data and that they, therefore, be given: \u2018write\naccess to all self-service functions, including applications for admission, changes of\naddress, module registration, leave of absence\u2019. Interestingly, the tentative and\npreliminary natures of allowing students write access is highlighted by a question\nmark, which follows the suggestion. Such tentativeness is also present later in the\ndocument where it outlines some possible future scenarios for student\nregistration:\nFor Sept 2001, it is proposed that personal and module registration takes place\nin Departments via personal tutors. New students will attend first, check theirThe \u2018Self-service\u2019 Student 111\npersonal details with their tutors and select module options where appro-\npriate. Exactly how this is done depends upon the level of access to the system\nin Departments (and on the preference of the Dept):\nOption 1) If all tutors had access e.g. via MySAP.Com and a web browser, it\nwould be possible to call up the student details on screen, check\/amend\nmaster data and select modules without the need to print, distribute and\ncomplete registration forms and module selection forms (and then re-input\nthe data into the student system).\nOption 2) SAP provides student self-service via a web browser to carry out\npersonal and module registration. New students could follow Option 1 with\nreturning students carrying out their own registration after first meeting with\ntheir tutor. This could be carried out via selected clusters [of university PCs] or\nDepartmental PCs. Students could be made entirely responsible for ensuring\nthat they register correctly and that their data are accurate or students could\nenter data under the supervision of central or local administrative or academic\nstaff. With students entering data, staff time could be used more productively\nin providing services for the students.\nProviding students with direct access to the system is an issue that has raised\nsome discussion and below we consider the debate that ensued among those\ngroups responsible for Campus Management\u2019s implementation.\nCounteracting the Sponsors Group\nThe day-to-day management of the project was controlled by a small project team\n(the  \u2018Sponsors Group\u2019), which reported to a larger steering committee (the\n\u2018Strategy Group\u2019). Whereas the Sponsors Group was staffed by those actively\ninvolved in implementing Campus Management, the Strategy Group was made up\nof senior academics and non-academics who held full-time positions elsewhere and\nwould come together only once a month. The role of the Strategy Group, which was\nchaired, attended and administered by members of the Sponsors Group, was to\nultimately review progress, oversee potential problems, help co-ordinate the system\nrollout across the institution, and have the final say over the various technical and\norganisational issues that arose. In practice, however, the Strategy Group often\nacted at times as something of an \u2018orthogonal group\u2019.48 That is, they openly\nattempted to counteract the dynamics and power structures of the group they were\ncharged with supervising. While the Sponsors Group was a narrowly focused body\nwith strong investments in the Campus Management technology, the Strategy\nGroup alternatively had a much wider membership from across the campus, some\nof who were critical of the project and its far-reaching objectives.\nObjections ranged from those questioning the implications of self-service for\nfoundational relationships and responsibilities, to the more practical issues of\nmanaging self-service access. One member, for instance, thought that self-service\nwent far beyond the question of administrative procedures, to the nature of the\nuniversity\u2019s relationship to its students, and this raised an issue about the way in\nwhich the system might undermine longstanding pastoral responsibilities. For\ninstance, if a Web browser or portal were to replace conventional mechanisms for\nthe payment of accommodation bills etc., this would then increase or, worse still,112 N. Pollock\nforce credit card use among students, thereby encouraging them to enter further\nnetworks of debt. Should the university be seen to be encouraging such practices?\nAllied to this there was a general opinion that while self-service was not necessarily\na bad thing there was the possibility when replacing the administrative apparatus of\ndestroying or submerging those interactions that are tacit, informal, flexible\u2014the\nvery processes that might, for instance, offer important forms of support to\nstudents. For instance, just how might a student ask for an extension on the\npayment of a late rent bill? Was this simply a matter of \u2018functionality\u2019 just waiting\nto be built into the system? Might cases that do not quite fit be supported by the\nincreasingly ubiquitous \u2018help desk\u2019? Alternatively, will \u2018non-standard\u2019 requests\nsimply fall between the inevitable cracks in the system?\nConcerns were also expressed as to whether students actually wanted or, more\nimportantly, could be \u2018trusted\u2019 with such access. This issue of trusting students is\nrecognised as a more general problem. To return to the good practice guide\nmentioned earlier, Gledhill tackles a similar issue, suggesting that for academic\nmatters and for many administrative matters students should not be given direct,\nwrite access to a system, as there is the potential for fraudulent use. This was an\nimportant issue at Red Brick and discussions exposed many potential problems. For\ninstance, if a student was to have control over their home address say, what was to\nstop them inputting an incorrect address, thereby allowing the student to claim\nthat he or she had not been notified of a demand for payment of fees or a letter\ndetailing a problem (such as the failing of an exam)?49 There were worries not only\nabout fraudulent use but also whether students could actually be persuaded to\nupdate their own records. One department head, for instance, described how they\ncurrently had a problem with postgraduates failing to register changes in modules\nand:\nIf, as is suggested with the self-service option, the departmental student office\nno longer has responsibility for this data it is unclear what will persuade\nstudents to update their files electronically (internal memo).\nWhat really troubled members of the Strategy Group, more than these\nconceptual questions, was \u2018data access\u2019; i.e. how to organise and manage the level\nof access users had to the system, their ability to view, input and update personal\nand course information. From the outset, it was clear that deciding access rights\nheld important implications and it was thus decided to form a smaller \u2018Data Access\u2019\ncommittee.50 The task was potentially enormous. The difficult issue was the\nheterogeneity of the student body. Could all students have access to the system\nregardless of the type of course they were following. The full-time and part-time\nMBA students, for example, often had large amounts of experience in working with\nIT systems in firms. They thus expected similar kinds of access and service at the\nuniversity. In contrast, the more traditional student who had joined the university\nfrom school was often less familiar and comfortable using these systems. Would they\nhave the skills and wherewithal to self-register? Also, should distance-learning\nstudents have the same (or more) access than those studying on campus?\nTheoretically, this issue could be resolved by allocating each user with an\nappropriate \u2018authorisation profile\u2019. This was a template that would help manage\nthe kinds of access particular groups of students had. However developing and\nmaintaining different authorisation profiles for several thousand students and staff\nwas seen to be \u2018prohibitive\u2019. Originally designed around the needs of firms, theThe \u2018Self-service\u2019 Student 113\nprofiles were limited and could not capture the diversity of the user base.\nImplementing them would require the time of several full-time members of staff. In\norder to keep development and maintenance costs down, therefore, the suggestion\nfrom the Data Access committee was to limit access and, where access is granted, to\nkeep this to as basic a level as possible.\nMore generally, then, it appeared that concerns were growing among the Strategy\nGroup. There were many \u2018unknowns\u2019 (whether they could fit the student body into a\nnumber of profiles, whether students would respond favourably to, or could be\ntrusted with access, etc.). The final deciding factor was that the supplier was late in\ndelivering the latest version of the software, which meant there would be little time\nfor testing the self-service concept before the go live date. Therefore, the Strategy\nGroup stalled and decided not to decide but postpone the decision until some time in\nthe future when there might be more \u2018certainty\u2019 surrounding the system.51\nIn the mean time, if the Campus Management implementation were to\nproceed, then it must do so in a much less adventurous manner, without self-service\nfunctionality. This meant that the system, rather than radically changing the\nuniversity, would instead mirror many of the current processes. This was a\ndisappointment for the Sponsors Group who had invested much time and effort in\ndeveloping the self-service concept across the university. At an away day meeting,\nthe Pro-Vice Chancellor in charge of the project described this postponement in\nterms of the Strategy Group\u2019s aversion to \u2018risk\u2019:\nThe Strategy Group didn\u2019t want students doing self-registration or registration\nvia the Web. .. [Therefore] the message given to SAP is that we want to\nminimise risk and minimise change. The screens will be different but overall\nbusiness process will be the same. The Strategy Group consensus was \u2018risk\naverse\u2019.\nBuilding a Global Product\nAs we have already mentioned, it was not simply the needs of Red Brick\ncontributing to the building of the system, it was also to include the requirements\nof a number of \u2018pilot sites\u2019 from around the world. Despite the fact that the software\nwas being designed to accommodate the structures and processes of many\nuniversities, Red Brick was confident that this would not impinge upon the shaping\nof their institution:\nThe University will need to explore all parts of the system and decide which\nparts of the functionality it wishes to use. The approach taken by the Strategy\nGroup is that the system functionality will not drive our academic aims and\nprocesses. Functionality will only be exploited if it supports the University\u2019s\naims for the management of its students or if it is required in response to\nexternal drivers (internal document describing the project).\nIndeed, it was widely acknowledged that Red Brick had been successful in\nensuring that its needs were well represented. This was both because it was the only\nBritish institution involved in the project, and thus acted to represent this large\nmarket, and because it was among those planning to attempt an early implementa-\ntion. One other pilot\u2014a North American university we are calling \u2018Large\nCampus\u2019\u2014was also planning to go live with the system at the same time. Unlike114 N. Pollock\ntheir British partner, however, this institution appeared to be enthusiastically\nembracing the technology. Indeed, not only were they open to the possibilities that\nself-service might afford but they were also attempting to persuade the supplier to\nincorporate further advanced functionality, such as credit card payment facilities\nand Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. According to a Large\nCampus report, these technologies suited their more \u2018competitive\u2019 and \u2018market\noriented\u2019 admission processes as well as the mode of interaction they were\nattempting to establish with their students:\nWith each passing year, [Large Campus] students are becoming more and\nmore proficient in their use of the Internet. Evidence of this is the increasing\nnumber of accesses to online services for students. .. from the campus website.\nStudents can register through the web, check grades and even find out about\nholds and accounts information.52\nThe worry at Red Brick now that they had \u2018temporarily\u2019 rejected self-service, was\nthat they would lose influence over the design of Campus Management. According\nto the Pro-Vice Chancellor in charge of the project, this is what was happening with\nthe American university\u2019s requests for new CRM software. As he saw it, the other\npilots were now making requests for functionality that would not fit Red Brick\u2019s\nexisting processes:\n. . . [Large Campus] also plonked on the table more requests for CRM and that\nhas blown the whole thing apart. If SAP meets this request, then that is less for\nus. SAP has finite support and [Large Campus\u2019s] need is more complicated\nthan ours is. If they are going to go live with a CRM approach and we\u2019re going\nfor a \u2018handicraft\u2019 approach based on our more \u2018handicraft\u2019 and \u2018paper-based\u2019\napproach then this has an implication for our business processes (notes made\nat away day).\nIn other words, as Red Brick had decided that such technologies were\nincompatible with their needs, the supplier had to prioritise one set of\nrequirements over another, choosing as some internal critics have described to\nbuild the system according to the needs of the larger US market. This left Red Brick\nconcerned that a system heavily favouring the US model of student administration\nwould have implications for its own methods for managing students. Indeed, in\nvarious aspects of the system the university was finding that it had to accommodate\nsoftware designed for the other pilots. One example, and there were many other of\nthis kind, was the part of the system used to record applications by prospective\nstudents. This was built according to procedures common within American\nuniversities, and as applicants there are required to submit \u2018application fees\u2019, the\nsystem automatically generates an \u2018accounting record\u2019 for each new prospective\nstudent so that the appropriate information can be logged. There is no similar fee\nrequirement in Britain therefore leaving Red Brick with the problem of deciding\nwhat to do with all the unwanted accounting records, some 30,000 being generated\neach academic year.\nTo what extent this means that Red Brick will eventually be forced to adopt self-\nservice functionality or that its processes will come to resemble further those of\nother institutions is unclear\u2014Red Brick is yet to decide on whether to go ahead\nwith self-service. However, the fact that these types of technologies are an integralThe \u2018Self-service\u2019 Student 115\npart of Campus Management suggests that it will be a factor shaping discussions\nand decisions concerning future student management. For example, the issue of\nthe accounting records was ultimately resolved by storing the records on the system\n(seriously hampering the efficiency of the system!) which did cause some irritation\nand enjoyment among the Strategy Group. On hearing of the problem, one\nmember suggested \u2018well, why don\u2019t we also charge a fee for every application we\nreceive?\u2019 It was some moments before the others seated around the table realised\nthat he was in fact joking and they accordingly burst out laughing. For a split\nsecond, then, it was an item on the table worthy of serious consideration!\nConclusion\nUniversities, we are increasingly being told, have an \u2018organisational problem\u2019. Many\nas a result of mounting pressures (both external and internal) have turned to new\nforms of computer systems (Enterprise Resource Planning) and their associated\norganisational philosophies (self-service) in an effort to build for themselves a\ndifferent and new type of organisation. We have described the case of a British\ninstitution and its attempts to move away from a professionally supported\nadministrative culture to one that is increasingly distributed and self managed. From\nthe outset, the assumption was that self-service\u2014just as it has been found to be\npopular among proponents and users of Electronic Commerce systems\u2014would\nwork equally well within the university. Indeed, the notion that people will\nincreasingly do things for themselves appears to be entirely in keeping within the\nspirit of an organisation that lacks \u2018an organisation\u2019 (i.e. the collegiate model with\nits high degree of individual and departmental autonomy). Whether this autonomy\nextended to students (given the legacy of old and established relationships) was a\nbone of contention. Installing self-service at Red Brick, therefore, involved both the\nimplementing of the ERP system and establishing a new role and identity for\nstudents. Initially, there was much enthusiasm for the introduction of the new\nsystem, particularly in those more paper-based and time-consuming functions for\nadministering students. There was a wide-spread recognition that processes for\nregistering students were badly in need of updating; forcing students to queue for\nhours to complete paperwork that might be completed online was seen to be\nunacceptable, especially given the changing demands of students who were now\nincreasingly \u2018critical as consumers\u2019. Much work was also conducted enrolling others\ninto the idea that they should take responsibility for information concerning\nthemselves and aspects of their courses. The aspect of particular importance for the\ninstitution was to ensure the accuracy of data in its systems\u2014an essential feature of\na modern, flexible organisation.\nAs we have said, the university is ambivalent about change. On the one hand,\nthis article lends further evidence to the debate on the conservatism of large\ninstitutions; that the unique structures and sets of complex relationships (such as\nthe committee structures) mean that technologies which propose radical change\nacross an organisation are difficult to implement. Despite pressure, many staff\nremained committed to established structures, identities and relationships.\nScepticism arose because it was recognised that the system went beyond mundane\nadministrative procedures to the nature of the university\u2019s relationship to its\nstudents and this raised concerns about the way in which self-service might\nundermine longstanding pastoral responsibilities. These technologies, in other\nwords, by shifting the burden of administration to students appeared to jeopardise116 N. Pollock\nthe university\u2019s unique relationship with its students. On the other hand, as this\narticle demonstrates, the adoption of ERP presents universities with particular sets\nof issues regarding the control and shaping of their systems and ultimately their\ninstitutional and organisational practices. This is a new problem as until recently\nuniversities have developed their own organisational computer systems. Campus\nManagement as part of an ERP system is a \u2018global product\u2019 and this means it can\nbe difficult to reject unwanted functionality. Rejecting self-service would require a\nlarge software effort, therefore taking their version of the system further from the\nglobal product. If this was to happen, there was the risk that they would be unable\nto make use of later upgrades and new functionality released to the world-wide ERP\nand Campus Management user community\u2014one of the reasons why the system was\nprocured in the first place (i.e. future proofing). While it was important that the\nsystem was modified to ease concerns of prospective users, there were also\ncompelling reasons, then, why the university should simply accept and accom-\nmodate inappropriate aspects. It appears, then, that this attempt to foster increased\nself-sufficiency among staff and students has led to the university suffering a\npotential loss in its own autonomy.\nIn summary, the institution at this point in time appears to be stalled at a\ncrossroads facing two (seemingly) opposing directions of technical and organisa-\ntional development. They can either decide to revert to developing software in\nkeeping with unique characteristics or they can continue along this new path and\naccept the problems and limitations of enterprise-wide systems and self-service. In\npractice, however, as we indicated at the outset, this is not an either\/or situation\nand universities are, of course, doing both. Moreover, to talk of the loss of unique\ncharacteristics or, as Barnett has described, the loss of a \u2018defining centre\u2019 is to\nsuggest that the university is able to return to a time when there was greater\ncoherence and more certainty around just what its principles were. Such a notion\nis romantic and we are frankly sceptical that such a period ever existed. We cannot\nunderstand the reshaping of the university by reference to \u2018pretechnological\nconditions\u2019 or to \u2018some prior unity irrelevant to the contemporary world\u2019.53 This\ndoes not mean, however, that we should jump the other way to embrace\nwholeheartedly the vision of the self-administering student. Rather, we are certain\nthat while self-service will become a central feature of student and university\nadministration more generally, this is likely to be in a largely reconfigured form.\nUnderstanding the kind of self-service which will emerge within universities (as well\nas the issues and tensions that arise from it), then, is crucial for academics and\ninstitutional managers alike.\nNotes and References\n1.

Though there is no research as yet available on the diffusion of self-service, it appears that\nmost (if not all) universities in the UK are engaging in some kind of self-administration based\nproject. Two early projects of particular note were conducted at Liverpool and Bath.\nLiverpool John Moores University (JMU), for instance, as part of a nationally funded\nresearch project, recently added a \u2018self-service front end\u2019 to an existing student record\nsystem (see http:\/\/www.s3.livjm.ac.uk).

ERP systems have a complex history which has seen their initial development in one context\nwith one set of users in mind (manufacturing) and constant re-development in light of theThe \u2018Self-service\u2019 Student 119\nexperiences of later adopting organisations (financial, chemical, local government and so\non).

The application of technologies to universities is raising numerous issues to do with fraud,\nboth in the potential of new systems to be misused by students (or staff!) and, just as\nimportant, highlighting loopholes in conventional practices. For example, one issue taxing\nacademic managers is how to confirm the identity of a student who is following an online,\ndistance course. How can they control for \u2018real-time plagiarism\u2019 in which a student copies\nfrom model answers posted on the web? Advocates of these courses, in response, have argued\nthat in the campus situation, there is relatively little direct checking of the student\u2019s identity\nin the examination hall, indeed, the staff undertaking the exam invigilation may not even be\nfrom the same faculty as the student. There is, in practice, little to stop a student paying\nsomeone to sit their exam for them. For further discussion of this see J. Cornford and N.\nPollock.  \u2018The university campus as a \u201cresource constraint\u201d: process and practice in the\nconstruction of the virtual university\u2019, in Lea and Nicoll (eds), op. cit.\n50. Another task of this committee was to discuss \u2018privacy\u2019, though they tended to focus on this\nin a rather narrow way, and in terms of ensuring how academic staff would have access to only\nthose students they had teaching or tutoring responsibilities towards. There was no\nconsideration given to the level of information (or secondary information) the institution\nwas able to collect on the student and the uses to which this might be put. For a\nconsideration of some of the issues related to this, see the chapter \u2018Databases as discourse\u2019\nin Mark Poster\u2019s The Mode of Information, Polity Press, Cambridge, 1995.\n51. Such temporal strategies are relatively common in universities, see Lockwood and Davies, op.\ncit.\n52. There is no research available to suggest how widely self-service technologies are used in\nAmerican universities. More anecdotal evidence gathered during the attendance of Campus\nManagement development sessions and workshops suggests that US institutions have been\nthinking about these kinds of systems for a year or two before their European or British\npartners.\n53.
