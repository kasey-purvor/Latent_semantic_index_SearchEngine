Taken together, results presented\nin this study provide an example of hierarchical regulation of\nlocal organ stem cell homeostasis by the inter-organ macro-\nenvironment. The expression ofBmp2 in subcutaneous adipocytes\nindicates physiological integration between these two thermo-\nregulatory organs. Our findings have practical importance for\nstudies using mouse skin as a model for carcinogenesis, intra-\ncutaneous drug delivery and stem cell engineering studies, because\nthey highlight the acute need to differentiate supportive versus\ninhibitory regions in the host skin.\nMammalian skin contains thousands of hair follicles, each under-\ngoing continuous regenerative cycling. A hair follicle cycles through\nanagen (growth), catagen (involution) and telogen (resting) phases,\nand then re-enters the anagen phase. At the base of this cycle is the\nability of hair follicle stem cells to briefly exit their quiescent status to\ngenerate transient amplifying progeny, but maintain a cluster of stem\ncells. It is generally believed that a niche microenvironment is\nimportant in the control of stem cell homeostasis in various systems8.\nWithin a single hair follicle, periodic activation of b-catenin in bulge\nstem cells is responsible for their cyclic activity3. However, how these\nstem cell activation events are coordinated among neighbouring\nhairs remains unclear. It is possible that a population of hair follicles\ncould cycle simultaneously, randomly or in coordinated waves. We\nrecently observed a \u2018cyclic alopecia\u2019 phenotype inMsx2 (homeo box,\nmsh-like 2) null mice, which in essence represents coordinated hair\nregenerative activity in a population of follicles and is manifest as\ntraversing hair waves9\u201311 (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nClassical works have documented hair growth waves in rats, mice\nand other mammals12,13. Opinions differ as to whether the hair\ngrowth pattern is controlled by local inherent rhythms, systemic\nfactors or both. Because there is a period after anagen during which\n\u2018\u2018the systemic stimulus is unable to exert an effect\u2019\u2019, the concept of\n\u2018telogen refractivity\u2019 was conceived14. A substance, termed \u2018chalone\u2019,\nwhich can inhibit anagen development, was proposed to explain this\nphenomenon15. However, despite efforts to identify the chalone16,17,\nits molecular nature has remained elusive for the past 50 years.\nIntrigued by these dynamic, complex hair growth patterns (Sup-\nplementary Fig. 1), we set out to find the underlying molecular\nmechanisms. A hair-cycle domain is a region of skin that contains\na population of hair follicles cycling in coordination. The fact that\nsuch domains form implies the existence of signals that serve to\nspread and stop waves of hair growth. This prompted the suggestion\nthat skin regions in telogen can be in either of the two functional\nphases: competent telogen, which allows the anagen-re-entry wave to\npropagate, and refractory telogen, which arrests the wave (Fig. 1a, b).\nWe analysed the cycling behaviour of domains inmore than 30 living\nmice (starting from older than 2months) for up to 1 year (Supple-\nmentary Fig. 1), and consistently found that there is a minimal 28-\nday-long telogen phase; this was defined as early telogen. After this\nphase, telogen can either end right away (0 days) or persist for any\nnumber of days up to about 60 days. This phase (defined as late\ntelogen) contributes to the apparently highly variable telogen length\n(Fig. 1c).\nThis suggests that the first 28 days of telogen are essential for the\nhair cycle andmay represent the refractory phase. To test this idea, we\nused club-hair (a hair filament that has stopped growing but remains\nattached in the follicle) plucking, which can induce hair regeneration.\nWe gauged responses by the time required for regeneration to start\nafter hairs are plucked (see Methods). When 50 hairs were plucked\nfrom skin in the early telogen phase, a longer time was required for\nhair growth than when a comparable number of hairs were plucked\nduring late telogen (requiring 42 versus 13 days). When 200 hairs\nwere plucked, the time required for hairs to re-grow became shorter\nbut still differed between early and late telogen (28 versus 9 days;\nFig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 2), so anagen re-entry is faster when\n200 hairs were plucked versus 50 hairs. Thus, the functional status of\na particular skin region can be determined by the hair plucking\/\nregeneration assay. In the follicles we studied, early (up to 28 days)\n1Department of Pathology, Keck School ofMedicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90033, USA. 2Centre forMathematical Biology, Mathematical Institute,\n24\u201329 St Giles\u2019, Oxford, OX1 3LB UK. 3Oxford Centre for Integrative Systems Biology, Department of Biochemistry, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3QU, UK. 4Department of\nBiochemistry and Molecular Biology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089, USA.\nVol 451 | 17 January 2008 |doi:10.1038\/nature06457\n340\nNature  Publishing Group\u00a92008\nand late (after 28 days) telogen periods correlate well with refractory\nand competent telogen phases, respectively.\nIf the refractory and competent states of hair-cycle domains are\ntransient, then offsetting the timing of hair cycling in a localized\nregion should lead to the formation of new hair-cycle domains. We\ntested this by local application of cyclosporine A (a powerful anagen-\ninducing agent that can overcome refractory telogen18) to a skin\nregion about 10mm in diameter that was in telogen day 1.\nEight days later, the treated region was in the induced new anagen\nwhereas the surrounding skin continued its progression through\nrefractory telogen. Soon after the treated region completed anagen\nand re-entered early (new) telogen, the surrounding skin had pro-\ngressed into late (competent) telogen. When a new hair growth wave\napproached, it propagated without obstruction over the untreated\ncompetent skin, but met resistance in the treated refractory region,\nthus forming a new hair-cycle domain (Fig. 1d).\nHair-cycle domains are different from regionally specific domains\nestablished in development (for example, footpad versus dorsal paw).\nThe exact domain boundaries can shift from cycle to cycle and the\ndomain patterns become more complex as the mouse matures13\n(Supplementary Fig. 1). These complex hair-cycle domains can be\naffected by systemic factors. For example, during pregnancy and\nlactation, femalemouse hairs that enter telogen are unable to re-enter\nanagen. Thus, multiple hair-cycle domains are reset into one single\ndomain after pregnancy and lactation19 (Fig. 1e). Oestrogen and\nprolactin have been implicated in inhibition of anagen initiation\n(Supplementary Information).\nWewanted to know themolecularmechanisms that constitute this\nrefractoriness. Using in situ hybridization and several lacZ reporter\nmice (including Bmp4\u2013lacZ, Nog\u2013lacZ and the TOPGAL reporter),\nwe searched for cyclic molecular expressions that correlate with\nrefractory and competent telogen. In longitudinal sections of a\nhair-cycle domain, the hair wave is \u2018frozen in time\u2019 and successive\ntemporal hair-cycle stages are laid out in a spatial order11, thus facili-\ntating molecular analyses. We observed canonical WNT signalling\nand Msx2, amongst others, to be expressed in different hair follicle\ncompartments and to fluctuate with hair cycling, as reported\n(Supplementary Fig. 9). Unexpectedly, we observed the expression\ndynamics of interfollicular Bmp2 to be out of phase with that ofWNT\nsignalling (Fig. 2a, b, and Supplementary Fig. 5a\u2013e). Bmp2 expression\nwas absent in early anagen and gradually intensified to reach a peak\nlevel in anagen V\u2013VI. Bmp2 expression remained high in early telo-\ngen, but became absent in late telogen (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary\nFig. 5c\u2013e, g). Bmp4 exhibited similar on and off expression dynamics,\nas shown by semi-quantitative PCRwith reverse transcription, in situ\nhybridization (Fig. 2c, d) and Bmp4\u2013lacZ expression (Supplementary\nFig. 3). In contrast, Nog\u2013lacZ expression showed that on and off\ndynamics of mesenchymalNog (including dermal papilla and dermal\nsheath; Supplementary Fig. 4)17,20 coincides with the hair-cycle\nrhythm. Because BMP activity can be modulated by multiple factors\n(different ligands, antagonists and receptors), we measured BMP\nsignalling output by pSMAD (phospho SMAD) 1\/5\/8 immunostain-\ning; this showed that SMAD 1\/5\/8 is activated in refractory and is\nabsent in competent telogen hair follicles (Fig. 2e and Supplementary\nFig. 6).\nWe noted that the ability to propagate anagen induction is limited\nto early anagen follicles. A wave front is halted when it faces a refrac-\ntory telogen region. By the time this refractory telogen region pro-\ngresses into competent telogen, the previously propagating anagen\nfollicles have progressed into late anagen and propagation does not\nresume (Supplementary Fig. 5c, d). Although the surrounding envir-\nonment is now competent, late anagen follicles are unable to pro-\npagate. In this way, the traditional anagen period can be divided into\nearly (anagen I\u2013IV) propagating and late (anagenV, VI) autonomous\nanagen, with low and high expression of both Bmp2 and Bmp4,\nrespectively, in these phases (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Figs 3\nand 5). We summarize the rhythms of marker gene expression in\nFig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 10.\nWhere are the BMP-producing cells? Most of the periodically\nexpressed Bmp2 transcripts are produced by subcutaneous adi-\npocytes, as judged by double-staining with Sudan Red (Fig. 2f).\na\nc\nd\ne\nf\nb\n  Pre-pregnant                         Pregnant                         Post-lactating\nSpreading wave\n80\nA\nve\nra\nge\n d\nay\ns\nD\nay\ns \ntil\nl h\nai\nr \ngr\now\nth\n60\n40\n20\n40\n30\n20\n10\nBorder\nInitiation\ncentre\nRefractory telogen Competent tel Anagen\nDays\nRefractory telogen Refractory telogenAnagen\nCyclosporin A\nNon Tx\nTx\nFigure 1 | Defining refractory and competent telogen. a, Propagation\n(blank arrows) of hair regenerative waves is seen inMsx2-null mice (also see\nSupplementary Fig. 1).

Collectively,\nwe define the extrafollicular sources of periodic Bmp2 and Bmp4\nexpression as the dermal macroenvironment. The macroenviron-\nmental BMPs may have a large additive effect on the strength of\nintrafollicular (microenvironmental) BMP6 and BMP4 signalling21,22\nin regulating the quiescence of pSMAD-positive bulge stem cells,\nalthough these mechanisms remain to be investigated. Because the\neventual anagen initiation requires activation of WNT\/b-catenin3,4,\nthere is competitive equilibrium between BMP and WNT signal-\nling21. Stem cells have to integrate themultiple signalling inputs from\nboth the microenvironment and the macroenvironment to make the\ndecision.\nThe first telogen (around postnatal day 19) is very short and\nnew anagen initiates quickly without detectable refractory telogen.\nDermis acquires telogen refractivity with maturation and second\ntelogen (postnatal day 45\u201370; Supplementary Fig. 6b) does have\nrefractory telogen. These findings lead us to hypothesize that: first,\nin the \u2018BMP on\u2019 phase, the macroenvironment prevents micro-\nenvironment-based activation of bulge stem cells (by means of\nWNT signalling), resulting in refractory telogen; and, second, in\nthe \u2018BMP off\u2019 phase, the macroenvironmental block is removed\nand the threshold for microenvironment-based activation of stem\ncells is low. This results in competent telogen; hair follicles are free\nto enter new anagen either by stochastic self-activation or by facili-\ntation by adjacent early anagen follicles. We tested this hypothesis by\ntransgenic perturbation of BMP signalling, skin transplantation and\nadministration of exogenous BMP4.\nIf BMPs have a causative role in conferring refractory status, we\nshould be able to reduce the period of refractory telogen by down-\nregulating BMP signalling. We did this by overexpressing Nog under\nthe keratin 14 promoter inKrt14\u2013Nogmice23 (named K14-Noggin in\nref. 23). The minimal telogen length was reduced to 6 days, and the\nmaximal length was reduced to 11 days (Fig. 3b). As a result, these\nmice displayed continuous propagation of hair regenerative waves\nand have highly simplified hair-cycle-domain patterns (Fig. 3a). We\nfurther tested the response of Krt14\u2013Nog hair follicles to hair pluck-\ning. The differences in response we observed in wild-type mice in\nearly versus late telogen were eliminated in Krt14\u2013Nog mice. In all\ncases, plucked Krt14\u2013Nog hair follicles required only approximately\n6 days to re-enter anagen (Fig. 3c).

To test directly whether the\nactivation of stem cells is also subjected to non-autonomous regu-\nlation, we transplanted skin grafts from pigmented Krt14\u2013Nog mice\nonto albino severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. If the\ncontrol of stem cell activation is intrinsic to the follicles, hair cycling\nbehaviour should remain the same for both donor and host. Instead,\nwe observed donor\u2013host interactions, reflecting a non-autonomous\nrelationship, with the outcome dependent on the size of the trans-\nplanted skin graft. When a small graft of Krt14\u2013Nog skin (,1mm)\nwas transplanted, the donor skin remained in telogen for longer and\ncould respond to an anagen-activating wave originating from the\nhost (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 7). Thus, we achieved partial\nfunctional rescue ofKrt14\u2013Nog phenotypes. In contrast, when a large\nskin graft (.10mm) was transplanted, the graft exhibited a greater\ndegree of autonomous control within itself. Host telogen hair follicles\nsurrounding the graft re-entered anagen (visible as a rim of white\nhairs) when pigmented donor hairs entered anagen (Fig. 3f) after\nonly 11 days in telogen (versus 28 days), thus providing evidence of\na donor effect on the host.\nClassical experiments using skin graft transplantation to ask\nwhether hair growth patterns are controlled intrinsically or syste-\nmically have produced variable results14. We repeated autologous\nskin transplantation experiments and observed that hair growth\npatterns are initially intrinsic to the donor but gradually become\nentrained to the host rhythm after several hair cycles (not shown).\nConsequently, the discrepancy amongst classical experiments may be\ndue to the size of the graft and the time they chose for readout. At the\nmolecular level, our results demonstrate involvement of the BMP\npathway in the non-autonomous interactions among follicle popula-\ntions. It remains to be investigated whether the process depends on\nthe direct diffusion of BMPs or their antagonists, or whether it is\nindirectly mediated by other mechanisms25.\nC57BL\/6J mice\nShort telogen in K14\u2013Nog Fast response to plucking\nNumber of plucked hairs\nRescue of telogen length\nD\nay\ns\nDorsal Ventral K14N\nKrt14\u2013Nog micea\nb c d\n1 mg ml\u20131 BSA\n1 mg ml\u20131 human BMP4\nh\ngfe Krt14\u2013Nog on SCID\nWT\n60d 60d 42d 8d 38d200 50 200 508d 40d 9d\nWTK14N\nWT WT\non SCID on SCID\nWT K14N K14N\nK14N\nFigure 3 | Altered hair regenerativewave dynamics inKrt14\u2013Nogmice, and\nnon-autonomous interactions with normal cycling host skin after\ntransplantation. a, Control (left) and Krt14\u2013Nog (right) mice.

Thus, the level of BMP activity can indeed\nexplain the functional status (refractory versus competent) of a skin\nregion.\nResults here add new dimensions to our understanding of skin\nbiology. First, these findings demonstrate that, in addition to short\ndistance microenvironmental control17,22, the activation of stem cells\nwithin large groups of hair follicles is subject to long distance macro-\nenvironmental control from the surrounding dermis (Fig. 4). This\nconcept is readily applicable to other organs. For example, whereas\nBmp4 is constantly expressed in the mesenchyme of intestinal micro-\nvilli, bursts of Nog expression in the villi stem cell niche may act\ntransiently to lower BMP signalling, thus allowing stem cells to pro-\nliferate for epithelial renewal26. Second, extrafollicular periodically\nexpressed Bmp2 and Bmp4 seem to fulfil the criteria of the elegant\nbut elusive chalone proposed to explain patterned hair growth14,15,17,\nthus solving a 50-year-old puzzle. Third, the dynamic expression of\nBmp2 in dermal adipocytes suggests a link between two skin organ\nsystems. Because subcutaneous fat, like hairs, has a thermo-regula-\ntory function and leptin is present in the dermal papilla of hair\nfollicles27, periodically expressed Bmp2 may coordinate the function\nof these two organs in response to the external environment andmay\nhave implications for the evolution of integuments28. Fourth, the\nasynchronous cyclic expression of BMPs and b-catenin in the dermis\nand hair follicle provide a platform for mutual modulations of these\n\u2018clocks\u2019 in the skin. They also imply that stem cell regeneration is\nsubject to the control of biological rhythms.\nFinally, mouse skin has been used extensively as a model in studies\nof carcinogenesis, intra-cutaneous drug delivery and stem cell bio-\nlogy29,30. Such studies are usually designed on the assumption that the\nskin is a stable and largely uniform medium. Our findings show\nclearly that this assumption is rarely, if ever, justified.\nMETHODS SUMMARY\nAnimals. C75BL\/6J, Crl:CD1(ICR), C3H\/HeJ and SCID mice were used in this\nstudy. Msx2 null (C.Cg-Msx2tm1Rilm\/Mmcd), Krt14\u2013Nog (B6,CBA-Tg(Krt14\u2013\nNog)), Bmp4\u2013lacZ (129S-Bmp4lacZneo), Nog\u2013lacZ (129S-Nogtm1Amc\/J) and\nTOPGAL (STOCK Tg(Fos-lacZ)34Efu\/J) transgenic mice were also used.\nHair-cycle observation. Progression of hair growth patterns was monitored in\nmice for various intervals of time, up to 1 year. Hair clipping was selected over\nplucking or shaving to avoid wounding that can potentially interfere with nor-\nmal hair growth13,15.\nAnimal procedures. All procedures were performed on anaesthetized animals\nwith protocols approved by USC vivaria. For skin transplantation, surgical pro-\ncedures were performed when both donor and recipient skins were in early\ntelogen. This was done to ensure that wounded skin is healed by the beginning\nof the next anagen phase and that the affect of wound healing on the hair cycle is\nminimal. SCID mice were used as recipients.\nHistology and detection ofmolecular expressions.Tissues were collected, fixed\nand processed for histology as described13,23.\nFull Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of\nthe paper at www.nature.com\/nature.\nReceived 9 July; accepted 7 November 2007.\n1.

To choose early versus late telogen skin\nin living mice, we used the following protocol.\nFirst, an area on the adult mouse skin where hairs appeared to be growing was\nchosen. The use of pigmented mice made it easier to distinguish these phases.\nHairs were clipped (not plucked) near the skin surface. Anagen-phase skin con-\ntains pigment in the proximal hair follicles. This determination can be aided by\nobserving the skin under a dissectionmicroscope, especially when the skin is wet\nwith saline solution to make it appear transparent. These mice were monitored\ndaily, and the day on which skin pigmentation ceased was recorded. This coin-\ncides with the anagen\/catagen junction. We then waited for an additional 5 days\nto ensure that skins are in early telogen, giving us early telogen skin to work with.\nAlternatively, we waited for at least 40 days (well over 4weeks) after the anagen\/\ncatagen junction for late telogen skin to develop, giving us late telogen skin to\nwork with.\nScoring the plucking experiments. Hairs were plucked from the early or late\ntelogen region. After plucking, each plucked spot was monitored daily under a\ndissection microscope. We were able to detect new anagen skin on living mice\nwithout having to biopsy or kill the mice for histological specimens. We then\nlooked for changes in pigmentation since the start of melanogenesis in anagen\nIII. Pigmented hairs can be spotted under a dissectionmicroscope before the new\nhair fibres reach the skin surface. Thus, we were able to record non-invasively the\nappearance of anagen III hair follicles (when we spotted black hairs under the\nskin surface). Approximately, this corresponds to the second day of new anagen.\nIt takes another day for the new hair fibre to reach the skin surface. Thus, wewere\nalso able to record non-invasively day-3 anagen follicles when the new hair\nfilaments reach above the skin surface.\nBecause the changes in skin pigmentation are not easily visible, we used the\nappearance of new hair filaments above the skin surface as the criteria for scoring\nhair-plucking experiments. Therefore, the results shown in Fig. 1f indicate that it\ntakes approximately 9 days to observe the appearance of day-3 anagen follicles.\nThe extra time includes the period required for the follicle to heal and to get\nready to enter anagen.\nProtein administration experiment. Intracutaneous administration of exogen-\nous protein was performed as follows. Affinity chromatography Affi-gel blue gel\nbeads were obtained from Biorad. Beads were washed in 13 PBS, followed by\ndrying. The beads were then re-suspended in 5ml protein solution, either control\n(BSA 1mgml\u20131) or experimental (human BMP4 1mgml\u20131), at 4 uC for 30min.\nRecombinant human BMP4 protein was obtained from R&D Systems.\nReconstitution of the protein was performed in 4mM HCl in 0.2% BSA as per\nthe manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Approximately 100 beads were introduced to the\ncompetent telogen skin of adultmice bymeans of a single puncture wound to the\nskin made by a 30 g syringe (insulin syringe). To replenish proteins, subsequent\ndoses of 1.5 ml protein solution were microinjected to the site of the bead\nimplantation every 24 h by means of a glass micro-needle until the tissue was\nharvested. After we noted the anagen-spreading wave pass beyond the bead\nimplantation sites (1week in the case of Fig. 3g, h), we collected the skin and\ninverted it for photography. This allows the study of the anagen-wave-spreading\ndynamics around the control and human BMP4 beads.\ndoi:10.1038\/nature06457\nNature  Publishing Group\u00a92008\n"}
