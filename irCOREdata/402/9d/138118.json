In powders designed for sintering this can \nlead to a high Gibb's free energy per unit surface area and hence a low \nrequired sintering temperature.  However for this goal to be achieved the \nagglomeration behaviour of the fine particle-size ceramic powder must be \ncarefully controlled. \nProcessing routes for producing monodispersed fine powders are \nbecoming increasingly common.  Sol-gel techniques have previously been \nused by several authors [1 - 7] to create PZT powders. \nIn a previous paper [8] a new sol-gel route, was used to prepare PZT \nsub-micron powder.  This utilized polyvinylpyrrolidone [PVP] which appeared \nto have little effect the primary particle size of the PZT but to strongly affect \nthe agglomerate size when added in a second process stage. \nIn this paper agglomeration control in this sol-gel route was studied.  The \neffects of water content, aging time and polyvinylpyrrolidone molecular weight \nwere investigated. \n \n \n \nExperimental \n \nThe preparation route of the Pb1.0Zr0.9Ti0.1O3 powder is shown in Figure \n1.  \nTo produce 320 ml of sol, the following route was used.  12.14 g of \nlead(II) acetate trihydrate was left under vacuum at 100 oC for 24 hours to \n 3 \nremove the water. 12.21 g of zirconium(IV) propoxide, 76.33% by weight in n-\npropanol, and 0.9 g of titanium(IV) isopropoxide were dissolved in 240 ml \nisopropanol.  This mixture was heated to 80 oC under stirring. After three \nhours the lead(II) acetate was added.  The mixture was stirred for another \nthree hours under the same conditions.  Extra isopropanol was added until the \nfinal volume of the solution reached the 320 ml. A light-transparent PZT sol \nwas obtained.  To transform this into a PZT-PVP sol, 10.42 g of \npolyvinylpyrrolidone [PVP] with average molecular weight of 10 000 were \nadded and the stirring was continued until the mixture became clear yellow in \ncolour.  \nThe resulting PZT-PVP sol had a concentration of 0.1 M of lead.  The \nPb(OAc)2 : PVP weight ratio of the sol was 1 : 1.  \nThe sol was subsequently treated to a secondary stage designed to \ninvestigate agglomerate formation in the subsequent powder. \nThe experimental variables of the second stage and their levels are \ntabulated in Table1.  The variables were: quantity of water, PVP molecular \nweight and aging time.   \nEach powder was prepared from 20 ml of sol and each PZT-PVP gel \nwas left for 20 min under stirring at 700 r.p.m.  For the sols with water added, \nwater was first diluted in 10 ml of isopropanol and then added to 20 ml of sol \nto hydrolyse it.  The [Pb]:[H2O] molar ratio of the sol was [1]:[30]. A selection \nof the gels was then aged for five days.  The powders were subsequently heat \ntreated at 500 oC for 24 h to obtain crystalline PZT. \nA Philips XL series Scanning Electron Microscope [SEM] was used for \npowder imaging.  Size measurements of the powder were performed using a \n 4 \nZeta-Sizer 3000 (Malvern Instruments). Each powder before the \nmeasurements was diluted in water and left in an ultrasound bath for 40 min. \nThe Zeta-Sizer was calibrated for the analysis step to have an upper \ndetermination limit of approximately 5 \u00b5m.   \n \n \nResults \n \nFigures 2-3 show the agglomerate size distributions of PZT powders that \nwere produced in this study. A summary table of their agglomerate size \ndistributions is given in Table 2. \nFigure 2 presents the agglomerate size distributions of PZT powders that \nwere produced from an unhydrolysed gel.  Figure 2-a, shows the agglomerate \nsize distribution from the unaged sample with second stage PVP with 10 000 \nMW.  A bimodal agglomerate size distribution was present, with agglomerate \nsize population ranges 60 - 200 nm and 200 - 800 nm.  Figure 2-b shows the \nmeasured agglomerate size range for the aged sample with the same \nmolecular weight of PVP.  This was 200 \u2013 2 000 nm.  Figure 2-c shows the \nagglomerate size distribution for the unhydrolysed powder with second stage \nPVP with 1 300 000 MW.  The measured particle size range was 80 - 5 000 \nnm for the unaged sample, where 5 000 nm represents the upper \nmeasurement limit of the measuring device.  For the aged sample, Figure 2-d, \nthe agglomerate size range was  700 - 5 000 nm. \nFigure 3 shows PZT powders that were produced from a hydrolysed gel. \nFigure 3-a shows the measured agglomerate size for the sample with second \n 5 \nstage polymer of 10 000 MW.  This was bimodal, with populations in the \nrange of 100 - 400 nm and 400 - 5 000 nm.  For the aged sample with the \nsame PVP molecular weight, Figure 3-b, the measured agglomerate size \nrange was 900 \u2013 5 000 nm.  For the powders with 1 300 000 MW second \nstage PVP the measured agglomerate population range was 70 - 3 000 nm \nfor the unaged sample, as shown in Figure 3-c, and 600 \u2013 4 000 nm for the \naged sample, as shown in Figure 3-d.  \nFigure 4 are SEM micrographs of PZT powders that were produced \nunder different conditions. No noticeable differences can be observed in the \nprimary free standing particles which size is between 50-100 nm. \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nThis processing study appears to confirm the observation made during \nthe initial work on this processing route [8] that the second stage processing \nroute variables have little effect on the primary particle size.   \nA comparison between the size measurements of the samples that \nwere aged for five days and the unaged samples, Figures 2-3, shows that the \naverage size of the agglomerates increased with time.  For example, the \nunaged sample in Figure 2-a had a bimodal agglomerate size population with \nranges 60 - 200 nm and 200 - 700 nm.  The aged sample in Figure 2-b had \nparticle size range 200 \u2013 2 000 nm. Similar comparisons can be made \nbetween the other samples.  During the aged period the particles would have \nhad more time to react and create bigger agglomerates in the solution [9][10]. \n 6 \n A comparison between the size measurements of the samples with \nsimilar preparation conditions (water amount, aged time) but different \nmolecular weight of polymer shows that smaller peak size ranges of \nagglomerates were produced when the polymer with 10 000 average \nmolecular weight was used.  For example the sample with 10 000 average \nMW of polymer, in Figure 2-a, had agglomerate size populations with ranges \n60 - 200 nm (30 % in volume of the particles belonged to this range) and 200 - \n700 nm (70 % in volume of the particles belonged to this range).  The sample \nwith 1 300 000 average molecular weight, in Figure 2-c, had agglomerate size \npopulation with ranges 80 - 700 nm (95 % in volume of the particles belonged \nto the 200 - 700 nm range) and 2 000 - 5 000 nm.  This indicated that the \npolymer with the smaller molecular weight interacted more efficiently with the \nsol and better protected the colloidal particles from coming into contact and, \nhence, create bigger agglomerates.   \n The effect of different molecular weight of PVP in the particle size has \nalso been demonstrated by Busser et al [11].  Busser et al. estimated that a \n4.5 nm spherical rhodium (Rh) particle in a water base Rh+-PVP solution with \nmolecular weight of the polymer 40 000, is surrounded by 192 polymer \nstrings.  The same particle in a similar solution with polymer molecular weight \n360 000 will be surrounded by 21 strings.  For a particle to obtain sufficient \nstabilization a large fraction of the metal surface has to be surrounded by the \npolymer [12].  For this reason a low number of polymer strings per particle \nindicates that multiple adsorption of the polymer on the metal surface is \nnecessary for sufficient stabilization. \n 7 \n A comparison between the size measurements of the samples with \nsimilar preparation conditions (polymer molecular weight, aging time) but \ndifferent water amount shows that the unhydrolysed samples gave powders \nwith smaller agglomerates.  For example, Figure 2-a shows the unhydrolysed \nsample with bimodal agglomerate size population ranges 60 - 200 nm and \n200 - 700 nm, whereas Figure 3-a shows the hydrolysed sample with bimodal \nparticle size population in the range 100 - 400 nm and 400 - 5 000 nm.  When \nhydrolysis occurs in a sol, condensation reactions also occur.  This leads the \nsmaller particles to react and create more complex and larger structures [13]. \nThe combination of the conditions that gave the finest powder was that of \n10 000 molecular weight PVP, where the sample was unhydrolysed and \nunaged, for which the agglomerate size distribution is given in Figure 2-a. \n \n \nConclusions \n \nIn this paper agglomeration control of a sol-gel route for the production of \nPZT powder was studied.   \nAgglomeration control was achieved by the addition of \npolyvinylpyrrolidone [PVP] during a second processing step.  The primary \nparticle size appeared to be unaffected by the changing the process variables \nduring this second stage. \nUnhyrdolysed PVP containing gels produced smaller average \nagglomerate sizes, as did unaged PVP containing gels.  The effect of PVP \nmolecular weight was less clear cut, but a lower molecular weight of PVP \n 8 \nappeared to reduce agglomerate size for powder produced from an \nunhyrdolysed gel. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis work would not have been possible without the financial support \nfrom the EPSRC [grant No: GR\/R43303].  \n \n 9 \nReference: \n1.
