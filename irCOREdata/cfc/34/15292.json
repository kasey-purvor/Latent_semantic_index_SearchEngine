Based on the reflections of Seers and Graen \nin their dual attachment model, in the present study we combined task demands, Leader-\nMember Exchange, and social structure in a model of antecedents of job satisfaction. The \nresulting model was tested using structural equation modelling. While task demands and \nLeader-Member Exchange are related to their respective equivalents in job satisfaction, social \nstructure is positively related to a latent factor job satisfaction, indicating that the social \nstructure of a job has an impact on different facets of job satisfaction. The results are \ndiscussed with respect to sample characteristics.  \nSocial structure and task demands \n \n3 \nIntroduction \nThe examination of job satisfaction has a long tradition, starting with Hoppock\u2019s study in \n1935 and continuing to the present day, as can be seen in recent studies (eg., Shirmer & \nLopez, 2001) and meta-analyses (e.g., Judge & Bono, 2001). There are three main areas of \nresearch into job satisfaction: first, job satisfaction is regarded as an antecedent of \norganizational outcomes such as performance (see meta-analyses by Iffaldano, & Muchinski, \n1985, and by Six, & Eckes, 1991), turnover (e.g., Griffeth, Hom, & Gaertner, 2000; Mobley, \n1977; Williams, & Hazer, 1986), and organizational citizenship behavior (e.g., Organ, & \nRyan, 1995). Second, job satisfaction is regarded as an outcome of organizational conditions \nsuch as, for example, leadership (e.g., Podsakoff, MacKenzie, & Bommer, 1996; \nSchriesheim, Neider, Scandura, & Tepper, 1992; Sparks, & Schenk, 2001), sex of leader (e.g., \nTrempe, Rigny, & Jacoun, 1985), social support (Frone, 2000; Liden, Wayne, & Sparrowe, \n2000; Sargent, & Terry, 2000; Schirmer, & Lopez, 2001; Stepina, Perrewe, Hassell, Harris, & \nMayfield, 1991), and task characteristics (Dodd, & Ganster, 1996; Seers, & Graen, 1984; \nStepina et al., 1991). Third, job satisfaction is regarded as a disposition influenced by \npersonality traits (e.g., Dormann, & Zapf, 2001; Judge, & Bono, 2001; Judge, Bono, & \nLocke, 2000; Judge, Locke, Durham, & Kluger, 1998). \nThe focus of our study was on job satisfaction as an outcome of organizational \nvariables, namely task demands, leadership, and social structure. Task demands are defined as \ntask complexity and autonomy as well as learning possibilities provided by a task. In short, \ndemanding tasks are those tasks that are regarded as personality enhancing by action core \ntheory (e.g., Frese, & Zapf, 1994; Hacker, 1998). With respect to the social structure of a \nwork place, we take into account personal contacts that employees have. We assume that the \ncontact persons serve as a possible source of support of the respective employee. Thus, social \nSocial structure and task demands \n \n4 \nstructure is defined in this study as a combination of positive relationships between the \nemployee and colleagues as well as supervisors. In addition, we will examine a special kind \nof leadership in its relation to job satisfaction: Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) is a dyadic \nand interactional approach to leadership and focuses on the relationship quality between \nleader and member (e.g., Graen, & Uhl-Bien, 1995). \nThe aim of this study was to combine task demands, social structure, and LMX and \nexamine their relative effects on job satisfaction. Until now, most of the research into task \ndemands or task characteristics in general, social structure, and LMX in relation to job \nsatisfaction has been done in the USA (see Graen, Novak, & Sommerkamp, 1982; Seers & \nGraen, 1984; but see also de Jonge, Dormann, Janssen, Dollard, Landeeweerd, & Nijhius, \n2001 for a study in the Netherlands). Our study sought to replicate the findings from US \nstudies in a European work context. In addition, prior research has been done with samples of \nfederal agencies (Seers, & Graen, 1984), public service organizations (Graen, Novak, & \nSommerkamp, 1982), and health care professionals (see Jonge, Dormann, Janssen, Dollard, \nLandeeweerd, & Nijhius, 2001). Most of the prior studies are based on the data of only one \norganization, respectively. The present study extends this research to the sector of blue and \nwhite collar workers working at low levels of organizational hierarchy and employed in \ndifferent kinds of organizations. In addition, the predictors of job satisfaction are combined \ninto a structural equation model to test for relative effect on job satisfaction. \nJob Satisfaction and Task Demands \nSeveral studies have shown the existence of positive relationships between different task \ncharacteristics and job satisfaction. More specifically, the following characteristics have been \nfound to relate positively to job satisfaction: autonomy and variety (Dodd & Ganster, 1996), \n(positive) task characteristics in general (Stepina et al., 1991), task variety (Zaffane, 1994), \nSocial structure and task demands \n \n5 \ntask clarity and significance (Ting, 1997), and task responsibilities (Blau, 1999). In the \nfollowing section, some of the results of these studies are reported with respect to the \nrelationship between task demands and job satisfaction. As task demands are defined in this \nstudy as task complexity, autonomy, or learning possibilities, we will analyse the reported \nstudies with respect to these facets only. As task variety is considered as similar to task \ncomplexity, we will review results on this facet as well. \nIn a laboratory study, Dodd and Ganster (1996) examined the interactive effects of \nvariety, and autonomy on job satisfaction. In Pearson correlations, objective task variety (r = \n.19), objective task autonomy (r = .30), perceived task variety (r = .48), and perceived task \nautonomy (.40) related positively to job satisfaction. A similar result is reported by Stepina et \nal. (1991) who examined the relationship between job characteristics (task variety, task \nidentity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback) and job satisfaction. The authors only \nreport the correlation between an overall measure of task xx and job satisfaction. This was \npositive (r = .55). Most of the relationships to facets of job satisfaction were smaller but still \npositive (pay satisfaction: r = .07; security satisfaction: r = .19; social satisfaction: r = .36; \nsuperior satisfaction: r =.24; growth satisfaction: r = .65). \nThese studies demonstrate that the higher demands connected with a task (e.g., \ncomplexity, autonomy) the higher the satisfaction of the employees. This is especially true \nwith respect to employees\u2019 perception of task demands (Dodd, & Ganster, 1996). The higher \ncorrelations for perceived task demands can, on the one hand, be due to common method \nvariance, or, on the other hand, be ascribed to the fact that the employees\u2019 interpret their tasks \n(Hackman, 1970). An interpreted task is then more highly related to job satisfaction than is \nthe objective task. \nJob satisfaction and Leader-Member Exchange \nSocial structure and task demands \n \n6 \nSeveral studies have focused on leadership and job satisfaction (e.g., Podsakoff, MacKenzie, \n& Bommer, 1996; Schriesheim, Neider, Scandura, & Tepper, 1992; Sparks, & Schenk, 2001) \nor on superior and\/or co-worker support and job satisfaction (e.g., Bradley, & Cartwright, \n2002; Ducharme, & Martin, 2000; Sargent, & Terry, 2000; Shirmer, & Lopez, 2001). In the \nfollowing, we will first concentrate on leadership and its relation to job satisfaction and then \non the social structure of a work place and job satisfaction. \nOne leadership approach that focuses especially on the relationship quality between \nleader and member is the LMX-approach (e.g., Dansereau, Graen, & Haga, 1975). We \nconsider this approach to be especially relevant with regard to job satisfaction as we assume \nthat more than any leadership style the relationship with the supervisor is of relevance for \nemployees satisfaction. Several studies show the positive relationship between LMX and \nsatisfaction (e.g., Schriesheim et al., 1992; Schyns, 2002; Stepina et a., 1991). In a meta-\nanalysis, Gerstner and Day (1997) show a high relationship between LMX and satisfaction, \nespecially between LMX and satisfaction with the supervisor.  \nJob Satisfaction and Social structure \nIn addition to leader behavior and quality of leader-member relationship, the relationships \nwith colleagues are part of social structure at the work place and assumed to influence job \nsatisfaction. As mentioned above, we define social structure as being composed of the \nrelationships an employee has with colleagues and superiors. In the following, we will shortly \nreview some relevant studies on that topic. Sargent and Terry (2000) focused on the effect of \nsuperior and co-worker support on job satisfaction. In their longitudinal study, superior and \nco-worker support both influenced job satisfaction positively, but to different degrees. \nWhereas the correlation of superior support (t1) to job satisfaction (t2) was r = .12, that of co-\nworker support (t1) to job satisfaction (t2) was r = .40, thus indicating that co-worker support \nSocial structure and task demands \n \n7 \nwas more highly related to job satisfaction in this sample. Similarly, Schirmer and Lopez \n(2001), who concentrated on the relationship between supervisor support and job satisfaction, \nfound supervisor support to be positively related to job satisfaction (r = .49).  \nTask Demands, Social structure, and Job Satisfaction \nHaving concentrated so far on the single relationships between predictors and job satisfaction, \nwe will now review research that has combined several variables in predicting job \nsatisfaction.  \nSeers and Graen (1984; see also Graen, Novak, & Sommerkamp, 1982) established a \nmodel combining task characteristics and Leader-Member Exchange in their relationship to \njob satisfaction. Leader-Member Exchange was positively related to overall job satisfaction \nand facets of job satisfaction. In addition, both Leader-Member Exchange and task \ncharacteristics were found to add to job satisfaction in a complimentary way. In general, \nStepina et al. (1991) replicated these findings.  \nA similar but more complex model was established by de Jonge et al. (2001). \nControlling for gender, age, and negative affectivity in a sample with nurses, they found a \nnegative relationship between task demands (time pressure, hard work, complexity) at Time 1 \nand job satisfaction at Time 2, and a positive relationship between workplace social support \n(by supervisor and by colleagues) at Time 1 and job satisfaction at Time 2. Job autonomy[1] \ndid not have an impact on job satisfaction. On the basis of these empirical findings, we \npropose the model presented in the following section.  \nModel of Job Satisfaction \nSeveral studies have shown that task demands, social structure, and Leader-Member \nExchange are positively related to job satisfaction. In the dual attachment model (Seers, & \nGraen, 1984), two factors (task characteristics and LMX) were combined in order to evaluate \nSocial structure and task demands \n \n8 \ntheir complementary influence on job satisfaction. In the present study, the aim was to extend \nthis model adding social structure to the prediction of job satisfaction. In different \norganizational contexts, these factors might enhance job satisfaction to differing degrees, \ndepending on, for example, the task that employees have to fulfil or the strength of the \norganizational structure. Thus, the results obtained by Seers and Graen (1984) and \u2013 in part \u2013 \nthose obtained by de Jonge et al. (2001) should be replicated and extended in a heterogeneous \nsample rather than in a one-organization sample. \nTo this end, the results of former correlation- and regression-based research were \nintegrated in a model of job satisfaction antecedents (see Figure 1). Task demands related to \njob satisfaction in a positive way. The same was true for social structure and Leader-Member \nExchange. Job satisfaction is defined as consisting of several facets (satisfaction with \nsuperior, with colleagues, with task, and with job conditions), as is common in job \nsatisfaction studies (see e.g., Law, & Wong, 1999; Yousef, 2000). In addition to a replication \nof results of prior research, this model makes it possible to estimate the relative influence of \ntask demands, LMX and social structure on job satisfaction. As an extension to the dual \nattachment model (Seers, & Graen, 1984), not only was Leader-Member Exchange taken into \naccount but also social structure with respect to co-workers and supervisors. \n-- Insert Figure 1 about here -- \nMethod \nSample \nThe sample consisted of 326 employees at low levels of the organizational hierarchy (i.e., \nemployees with no supervisory function or only one level of employees below them, that is, \nfirst and second hierarchy level seen from bottom-up). Most employees (N = 304) worked in \ncompanies in East Germany (former GDR). The questionnaire was distributed in 13 \nSocial structure and task demands \n \n9 \ncompanies. The number of employees that filled out the questionnaire in the companies \nranged from 5 to 170 (in the latter case, different branch plants of one organization were \nassessed). The organizations belonged to different sectors such as telecommunication, \nunderground engineering, bookbindery, brewery, and automotive component suppliers. One-\nhundred-and-twenty-four of the participants were female and 196 were male (six persons did \nnot indicate their sex). The average age was 39 years (SD 9.6, range 18 to 60).  \nProcedure \nMost questionnaires (N = 275) were administered to the participants during work hours. They \nwere filled out in the presence of the first author. She explained the aim of the study and \nassured participants that the data would be treated confidentially. It was also explained that \nthe study was conducted in agreement with, but independent of, the upper management. The \nquestionnaires were collected immediately after the session. \nThe remaining questionnaires (N = 51) were distributed by superiors and sent to the \nfirst author by the participants or were collected by her. The first page of the questionnaire \ncontained the same information as was given to the other participants verbally (aim of the \nstudy, confidential treatment of data). The participants from these companies did not differ \nsignificantly from the others as regards age or organizational tenure. T-tests were done to \ncheck for differences in the dependent and independent variables. Taking into account the \nnumber of test and adjusting the alpha level accordingly (p = .05\/7 = .007) no difference \nbecomes significant. Thus, the samples can be regarded as alike and will be analysed together.  \nInstruments \nTask demands were assessed using an instrument designed by Mohr, Schyns, and Rigotti \n(2000) which is based on the action core theory (e.g., Frese, & Zapf, 1994; Hacker, 1998). \nUsing a 5-point scale, employees evaluate how demanding they experience their present \nSocial structure and task demands \n \n10 \ntasks. The scale consists of seven items (see appendix). The scale ranges from 1 = applies \ncompletely to 5 = does not apply at all. The instrument had an internal consistency \n(Cronbach\u2019s alpha) of \u03b1 = .69.[2]  \nLeader-Member Exchange is assessed using the LMX 7, an instrument recommended \nby Graen and Uhl-Bien (1995; German translation: Schyns, 2002). A sample item is: \u201cHow \nwell does your leader understand your problems and needs?\u201d. The scale ranges from 1 to 5 \nwith different verbal anchors that fit the respective question. The internal consistency \n(Cronbach\u2019s alpha) in this study was \u03b1 = .89. \nSocial structure (Rigotti, 2002) consisted of four items. The participants were asked \nto evaluate the social structure in their present working situation on a 5-point scale. A sample \nitem is \u201cAt my present workplace, I am accepted by my colleagues\u201d. Similar to the scale \nassessing task demands, this scale ranges from 1 = applies completely to 5 = does not apply at \nall. The four items had an internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s alpha) of \u03b1 = .61.  \nJob satisfaction was measured by combining the evaluation of four facets: satisfaction \nwith the superior (12 items; e.g., fair, active), with colleagues (8 items; e.g., nice, lazy), with \nthe task (12 items; e.g., boring, responsible) and with job conditions (11 items; e.g., noise, \ndirt). This instrument is based on the Job Description Survey (Hackman, & Oldham, 1975) \nand was adopted for use in Germany by Neuberger and Allerbeck (1980). The scales range \nfrom 1 = yes, 2 = rather yes, and 3 = rather no, to 4 = no. The internal consistencies \n(Cronbach\u2019s alpha) were \u03b1 = .91, \u03b1 = .83, \u03b1 = .88, and \u03b1 = .87, respectively. \nResults \nHandling of missing data and descriptive statistics \nOf the 326 subjects in the original sample, seven subjects who had missing data on all seven \nscales used in this study were removed from the sample. In the remaining sample 50 subjects \nSocial structure and task demands \n \n11 \nstill had  at least one missing score: 27 subjects had one missing score, 16 subjects had two \nmissing values, six subjects had three missing values, and one subject had four missing \nvalues. In total, 81 scores were missing which is 3.6 % of the total number of potential scores.  \nSince listwise deletion of subjects with missing scores would further reduce sample \nsize by 50 units, it was decided to impute the missing scores by using the regression approach \nas implemented in the Missing Value Analysis (MVA) procedure of SPSS 11.5. In this \napproach each missing value on a particular variable is replaced by its expected value that is \nbased on an appropriate regression analysis (Little, & Rubin, 2002). In order to prevent \nunderestimation of the variances and covariances of the variables, a randomly chosen \nregression residual was added to each imputed score.  \nTable 1 contains the means and standard deviations of the scale scores after \nimputation of the missing values. Table 2 contains the correlations among the seven scales. \n-- Insert Tables 1 and 2 about here-- \nThe correlations were all positive, and all, except one, were statistically different from \nzero.  For task demands, they ranged from r = .056 to r = .402 The highest correlation was \nfound to satisfaction with the task, i.e., the conceptually closest construct. For Leader-\nMember Exchange, correlations ranged from r = .147 to r = .701. The highest correlation was \nto satisfaction with the superior, which was also the conceptually closest construct (see also \nvan Breukelen & Konst, 1997; Gerstner & Day, 1997). For social structure, the correlations \nranged from r = .226 to r = .574, the highest being to satisfaction with the supervisor, which \nis a conceptually close dimension of job satisfaction and satisfaction with the task. \nThis preliminary analysis gives some support to the assumption of construct validity \nof the constructs used here, as the correlations between the constructs were always highest for \nthe conceptually closest constructs. \nSocial structure and task demands \n \n12 \nStructural equation modelling \nFigure 1 gives a graphical representation of the structural equation model that will be tested in \nthe following analyses. \nThis model assumes that the scores on a latent satisfaction variable F, which is \nmeasured via the four indicator variables satisfaction with the supervisor, satisfaction with \ncolleagues, satisfaction the with the task, and satisfaction with job conditions, are causally \ndetermined by the three exogenous variables task demands, Leader-Member Exchange, and \nsocial structure. Since none of these three exogenous variables is assumed to have a direct \neffect on each of the satisfaction indicators, the latent variable F acts as a mediating variable \nbetween the exogenous and indicator variables. This MIMIC model (Multiple Indicators \nMultiple Causes) consists of a structural part that describes the effects of the exogenous \nvariables on the latent satisfaction variable, and a measurement part that describes how the \nlatent variable is related to its indicators.  In the terminology of Bollen and Lennox (1991) \nand of Jarvis e.a. (2003) the four satisfaction measurements are reflective indicators for the \nlatent satisfaction construct, whereas the three exogenous variables can be considered as \nformative indicators for that construct.   The package AMOS 5.0 was used to fit and test \nseveral structural models (Arbuckle, & Wothke, 1999). \nIn a first step the measurement part of the model was investigated by testing whether \nthe covariance among the four indicators could be explained by a single factor model. This \nmeasurement model provided an excellent fit to that part of the data: the analysis yielded a \nchi-square value of 1.137 with df = 2 and p = .566 (TLI = 1.019 and RMSEA = .000). The \nstandardized factor loadings of the four indicator variables are shown in Table 3.  \n-- Insert Table 3 about here-- \nSocial structure and task demands \n \n13 \nAll four indicators are clearly related to the latent variable with job satisfaction with \nthe satisfaction with the task apparently being the best indicator of the underlying construct. \nIn a second step the integrated model as depicted in Figure 1 was tested. It had to be \nrejected since the analysis yielded a chi-square value of 100.930 with df = 11 and p = .000. \nMoreover the descriptive fit indices TLI and RMSEA attained unacceptable values for this \nmodel: TLI = .706 and RMSEA = .160. Hence, the model in which the latent variable F acts as \na mediating variable between the three exogenous variables and the six indicators does not fit. \nSince in the previous analysis the measurement part of the model was found to be \nsatisfactory, the bad fit of the complete model probably originates in its structural part. \nInspection of the modification indices provided by this analysis suggested that some direct \neffects of the formative on the reflective indicators should be added to the model.  On \nsubstantive ground direct, non mediated effects from task demands to satisfaction with the \ntask and from LMX to satisfaction with the supervisor were added to the model. Hence, direct \neffects were added between the conceptually closest concepts. The ensuing model fit the data \nvery well with a chi-square value of 57.831 with df = 10 and p = .239 (TLI = 0.990 and \nRMSEA = .030). Moreover, this model could be further simplified since the path coefficients \nof the exogenous variables task demands and LMX on F were no longer significant. Setting \nthese path coefficients equal to zero lead to the final model that is shown in Figure 2. \n-- Insert Figure 2 about here -- \nFigure 2 also gives the estimates of the standardized regression coefficients and factor \nloadings. All the coefficients reported in this figure were highly significant at the 1 % level \nand could not be removed from the model without resulting in a non-fitting model. All four \nsatisfaction variables remain excellent indicators of the underlying construct, which acts as a \nmediator between social structure and the four indicator variables. However, the correlation \nSocial structure and task demands \n \n14 \nbetween the four indicators and the two remaining exogenous variables LMX and task \ndemands are not due to indirect effects mediated by the latent satisfaction variable. \nSummary and discussion \nThe aim of this study was to further investigate task demands, Leader-Member Exchange, and \nsocial structure as they relate to job satisfaction. A model of job satisfaction was introduced \nwhich made it possible to estimate the impact of task demands, LMX, and social structure \nrelative to each other as antecedents of job satisfaction. \nIn preliminary correlation analyses, all correlations but one (satisfaction with \ncolleagues) between the task demands and the different facets of job satisfaction were \npositive, thus supporting prior research. The highest correlation was found to the conceptually \nmost closely related construct (i.e., satisfaction with the task) , thus confirming the construct \nvalidity of the instrument used here. The same holds true for LMX, social structure and job \nsatisfaction: LMX and social structure were both positively related to all facets of job \nsatisfaction. The correlations of LMX and social support were highest for satisfaction with \nthe superior. Although the correlation between social support and satisfaction with the task \nwas higher than that to satisfaction with colleagues, the correlations can serve as indicators of \nthe validity of the instruments used here. In addition, overall job satisfaction was assessed \nusing four indicator variables, that is, satisfaction with the supervisor, satisfaction with \ncolleagues, satisfaction with the task, and satisfaction with job conditions. A test of the \nmeasurement model showed that general satisfaction is adequately measured by these four \nindicator variables.  \nA model including task demands, LMX, and social structure as predictors of overall \njob satisfaction had to be rejected on the basis of the fit indices. Allowing for direct effects of \nthe variables that were conceptually closest, task demands and satisfaction with the task and \nSocial structure and task demands \n \n15 \nLMX and satisfaction with the supervisor, lead to a well-fitting model. We can, therefore, \nconclude that satisfaction with the superior and with the tasks is determined by LMX and task \ndemands, respectively. Social structure in contrast has an effect on overall satisfaction. This \nresult is extremely interesting and has some implications for the organizational practice. \nAlthough LMX has been found to be related to overall job satisfaction, we could not replicate \nthis finding in our sample. In our model, LMX was only substantially related to satisfaction \nwith the supervisor. This relationship itself is of course not surprising as the two variables are \nconceptual similar. But why does LMX not relate to overall job satisfaction? We would have \nexpected that the quality of the relationship has an impact on overall job satisfaction as LMX \nhas, for example, been shown to be related to delegation (Yukl, & Fu, 1999), which \ninfluences other components of the job and, therewith, overall job satisfaction. We can only \nspeculate that the leaders of our participants, being on low levels of the organizational \nhierarchy, may not have much power to influence their followers\u2019 jobs in general. \nTask demands did not relate to overall job satisfaction as well whereas social structure \ndid. We may be able to explain this with a special characteristic of our sample. The study \ntook place in a region with high unemployment. Employees might feel they should adapt even \nto poor working conditions in order to avoid unemployment. Particularly in times of low \nemployment rates and job insecurity, social resources are needed and become more important. \nGetting along with one\u2019s superior might reduce the fear of losing one\u2019s job. Also, the support \nof colleagues might help one to overcome negative effects due to an unsatisfying task. In \naddition, many employees that participated in this study might have experienced the \nsuspension of colleagues. Experiences like this might encourage colleagues to \u201cstick \ntogether\u201d. This notion is supported by different studies, which show that social support is \nhelpful in coping with job strains (e.g., Karasek, Gardell, & Lindell, 1987).  \nSocial structure and task demands \n \n16 \nLimitation, applications, and future research \nOne limitation of the study is the type of data: all data were based on self-report. This is \nclearly a strong limitation. Still, as the dependent variable was job satisfaction, it is important \nto note that the workers\u2019 perceptions of the actual working conditions are more relevant than \nthe objective conditions. From prior research, it is known that even workers with poor \nworking conditions report high levels of job satisfaction, a phenomenon known as resignative \njob satisfaction (Bruggemann, Grosskurth, & Ulich, 1975). Based on the results of Rosse and \nMiller (1984, see also Miller, & Rosse, 2002), adaptation to poor working conditions is \npossible. Thus, although research hints at the negative consequences of such working \nconditions (see, e.g., Volpert, 1985), for job satisfaction, the perceived conditions are more \nrelevant than the objective conditions. Of course, it would be interesting to see if more \nobjective data (e.g., measuring task demands through task analysis) would lead to the same \nresults as found here. In addition, the sample mainly consisted of employees in a region of \nhigh unemployment. In other regions, the results might be different, thereby limiting \ngeneralizability. \nThe sample consisted of employees at low levels of the organizational hierarchy. This \nmight influence the relative importance of social structure for job satisfaction. As the task \ndemands are generally low in such a sample, tasks are not satisfying in and of themselves. \nThus, social structure become more important for overall job satisfaction. \nThe limitations mentioned have implications for the use of the results in companies: if \nthe results can be replicated, companies should - especially in times of low employment - \nprovide supportive social structure in order to increase employees\u2019 overall job satisfaction. \nFor other facets of job satisfaction it seems more important to focus on the respective aspect \nof the job. \nSocial structure and task demands \n \n17 \nOne may speculate on how the limitations here, stemming from sample \ncharacteristics, influenced the results of this study. Whereas in this sample, social structure \nwere of more impact for overall job satisfaction than were task demands of LMX, this may be \ndifferent in different samples. An example might be samples with higher levels of education \nand thus higher task demands. Here, the social structure might be of less importance for job \nsatisfaction as long as tasks are of good quality and satisfying enough in themselves. For \nremote jobs (e.g., virtual teams), the social structure might be of even more importance for \njob satisfaction as employees may suffer from isolation. Thus, the model introduced here may \nlead to different results depending on the tasks the participants have to fulfil and on the social \nstructure they face in their jobs. A replication of the model using different samples would \nthus permit a comparison of results for specific samples.  \nAnother limitation is the cross-sectional design of the study. In future research, \nlongitudinal studies will be necessary to examine if task characteristics and social structure \nare necessary antecedents of job satisfaction. In a cross-sectional study, one might also \nspeculate that employees who are satisfied with their jobs contribute positively to the social \nstructure in their work groups. \nSocial structure and task demands \n \n18 \nReferences \nArbuckle , J.L., and Wothke, W.

If it is assumed that the \nm items in a homogeneous scale should  have correlations of at least 0.25 with each other, \none may prove that Cronbach\u2019s alpha should be at least m\/(m+3). Although this result is \nderived under the assumption that all items are mutually exchangeable, the criterion that \nCronbach\u2019s alpha should be larger than m\/(m+3) seems to work very well in practice. In the \npresent study all scales satisfied the criterion. One should realize of course that this rule only \nstates a minimum requirement on Cronbach\u2019s alpha and that in general one should strive at \nvalues that are much larger than this lower bound. \n"}
