The mix principle has enjoyed a long history in British housing and \nplanning policy (Bennett, 2005).  Its recent resurgence signals the intention to use \nhousing and planning policy as a corrective to the natural tendency of the housing \nmarket to segregate, rather than allowing policy to create or reproduce socially and \neconomically homogenous neighbourhoods. While this approach has recently come \nunder fire from economist Paul Cheshire (2007) who argues that state \nintervention to create mix through spatial policy cannot resolve the \u201edeeply \nentrenched social and economic forces at work\u2019 and that  \u201cthe conclusion for \npolicy is to reduce income inequality in society, not build \u201cmixed \nneighbourhoods\u201d, it tends to attract broad support elsewhere.  \n   \nPerhaps more controversially, \u201emixed communities\u201f has also now become a \nprinciple governing the regeneration of existing disadvantaged neighbourhoods, \nand this is our focus here.  The application of the approach to low-income \nneighbourhoods was first announced in January 2005 as the \u201eMixed Communities \n 3 \nInitiative (MCI)\u201f, part of the government\u201fs five year plan for the delivery of sustainable \ncommunities.  \n \nIts essential components, as described by government officials and policy documents \n(Lupton et al forthcoming) are four-fold.  First, a commitment to long term transformation \nof areas of concentrated poverty, so that they have better housing and environments, \nhigher employment, better health, less crime and higher educational attainment.  \nSecond, the achievement of transformation through changes in the housing stock and \nthe attraction of new populations as well as through improved opportunities for existing \npopulations.  Third, financing development by realizing the value of publicly owned land \nand other assets through the leverage of private sector investment, and fourth, the \nintegration of government policies and programmes at the local level to provide a \njoined-up or holistic approach, sustainable through mainstream funding programmes.   \n \nCurrently, the MCI is delivered through twelve demonstration projects (DPs), all in areas \nbetween about 7,000 and 14,000 in population, located in different regions, but among \nthe 2% most disadvantaged neighbourhoods in the country.  Importantly, and in contrast \nto previous approaches to area regeneration in the UK, the projects are not directly \nfunded by central government. They do, however, receive support and guidance from \nCommunities and Local Government (CLG)2 and from an expert panel of appointed \nconsultants, and they participate in a learning network.   They are, in a sense, \n\u201epathfinders\u201f for the mixed community approach.  The government is encouraging the \nsame approach to be taken more generally, and there are other neighbourhoods that \n                                            \n2\n The government department responsible for housing and urban policy in England. \n 4 \nare undergoing similar processes of regeneration without designation as demonstration \nprojects (Silverman et al. 2006, Bailey et al. 2006). The transformational goals and the \nmix of public and private finance have also been implemented through New Labour\u201fs \nHousing Market Renewal (HMR) initiative.3  \u201eMixed communities\u201f is therefore an \napproach as well as a specific initiative. Here, we refer to the approach as the \ngovernment\u201fs policy. The MCI demonstration projects are particular examples from \nwhich we draw evidence. \n \nIn the light of this policy development,the purpose of this paper is two-fold.  In \nthe first part we aim to shed light on the rationale and underpinnings of the mixed \ncommunities approach.  We review it in relation to theories of poverty, place and \ngentrification in urban policy, as well as in relation to debates about the \nrelationships between central and local government, capital and community.  We \nconclude that both in its underpinning analysis of the problems of poverty and \nplace and in the way it configures responsibilities for responding to these \nproblems, it represents a neo-liberal turn in New Labour\u201fs urban policy.  In the \nsecond part, we look at early evidence from the evaluation of the demonstration \nprojects to explore how the new policy approach is playing out in practice at a \nlocal level, where it is laid on top of existing ideologies and governance \nstructures.   \n                                            \n3\n HMR operates at a subregional level to intervene in areas with poor or no housing market conditions, \nHMR pathfinder bodies were specifically created by government with substantial funding (total budget of \n\u00a31.2bm between 2004-08, while MCI is an endogenous programme enacted and funded by the local state \nand focused on the neighbourhood level.  Nevertheless, some of the same principles are evident. \n 5 \n \nTheories of Poverty and Place  \n \nWhether explicitly or not, all urban regeneration interventions reflect theoretical \nunderstandings of the causes of place poverty.  We suggest that in broad terms a \ndistinction can be made between early urban regeneration by the Keynesian welfare \nstate, which enacted urban policy to internalise economic crisis and deal with its \nconsequences  through a \u201eneighbourhood improvement\u201f approach (Katz 2004), and the \n\u201eneighbourhood transformation\u201f approach of Conservative governments.   \n \nCrudely put, neighbourhood improvement policies were premised on an understanding \nthat the problems of declining areas arose from economic structures that created spatial \nas well as social inequality. They responded by concentrating on ameliorating local \nconditions and attempting to equalise life chances through compensatory social welfare \nprogrammes.  The Community Development Projects  (CDPs) of the late 1960s were an \nearly example of this approach and sparked a long-running debate about the limitations \nof local intervention in the light of broader structural inequalities (CDP 1974).  \n \nWhile some elements of the neighbourhood improvement approach have been retained \nthroughout British urban policy since the CDPs, the 1980s and early 1990s saw the \nadoption of a \u201etransformation approach\u201f.  Here the problems of poor neighbourhoods \nwere defined in terms of market failure, rather than underlying economic structures, and \nwelfarist interventions such as the creation of mass public housing estates and \n 6 \ngenerous benefit regimes were seen as compounding the problem by trapping people in \npoverty, within a context of the failure of state hierarchies in service provision compared \nwith the market (Goetz, 2003). In some accounts, residents of poor neighbourhoods \nwere partially implicated in the problem of place poverty, through notions of dependency \nculture and cultures of poverty.  Further, poor neighbourhoods were seen as holding \nback investment, particularly in inner urban areas where low income residents occupied \nprime commercial or residential space at low values. The solution was not simply the \namelioration of conditions in these neighbourhoods for the benefit of their current \nresidents, but the restoration of market functionality through physical change and \ntransformation of the position of the neighbourhood in the urban hierarchy. The clearest \nexpression of this was the Urban Development Corporation policy of the early 1980s, \nwhich brought about the transformation of London\u201fs Docklands.  A key change was that \nthe state shifted from being a regulator of the market to an agent of the market, \nfostering the conditions in which areas and communities could become economically \nproductive (Barnekov, 1989) and ensuring the social reproduction of labour and profit \n(Smith, 2002).  In these respects, the Conservative approach was clearly informed by \nneo-liberal economic and political theory (Cochrane, 2003).6   \n \nNew Labour urban regeneration policy from 1997 to 2004\/5 seemed to signal a return to \nthe improvement approach in the form of enhanced public services, the National \nStrategy for Neighbourhood Renewal, the creation of the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit, \nand the flagship regeneration programme New Deal for Communities (NDC), which \n                                            \n6\n Harvey (2005 p2) defines neo-liberalism as \u201ca theory of political practices that proposes that human \nwell-being can best be advanced by liberating entrepreneurial freedom and skills within an institutional \nframework characterised by strong private property rights, free markets and free trade\u201d (p2). \n 7 \nbrought together local agents in a holistic approach to neighbourhood improvement.  \nTransformation was not an original goal of NDC. In fact, the initial remit of the \nprogramme did not even include housing, which was a later addition. The establishment \nof locally elected boards to run NDCs gave them a strong communitarian feel, \nostensibly positioning local residents as the victims of neighbourhood decline and the \nintended beneficiaries of government investment.  Other elements of New Labour\u201fs \napproach reveal neo-liberal tendencies (Fuller and Geddes, 2008), such as the \nemphasis on \u201eequality of opportunity\u201f, rather than \u201eequality of outcome\u201f (Levitas, 1998), \nthe emphasis on individual problems rather than structural forces, and the devolution of \nresponsibility to citizens for addressing social exclusion.  However, New Labour\u201fs early \nresponse to place poverty seemed clearly to represent compensatory support for \nindividuals and places that markets put at risk through ameliorative state-funded \ninterventions.   \n \nThe more recent adoption of the mixed communities approach seems to move New \nLabour\u201fs urban policy to a more clearly neo-liberal position.  We say this for three \nreasons:   \n \nFirst, while mixed communities retains some \u201eimprovement\u201f elements, it is clearly \ndifferent from the previous New Labour initiatives in its adoption of the thesis \nthat \u201econcentrated poverty\u201f (or in some iterations, concentrated social housing \ntenure) is the problem and  \u201ede-concentration\u201f the solution.  In a way \nunprecedented in the earlier years of New Labour, UK policy documents from \n 8 \n2005 onwards draw heavily on the notion of \u201eneighbourhood effects\u201f, defined as \nthe \u201cadditional disadvantages that affect poorer people when they are \nconcentrated in poor neighbourhoods\u201d (ODPM 2005b p 52).  The Minister for \nCommunities and Local Government also argued that \u2019communities with a high \nconcentration of single-tenure, low-income residents have not worked in the past, and will not \nwork in the future\u2019 (Weaver 2006).  \n \nWe do not have space here to fully document the origins of this thesis in the work \nof US sociologist William Julius Wilson (1987; 1997) and its development through \nquantitative analyses of income segregation and neighbourhood.13 The key issue \nis that in policy discourse  \u201econcentrated poverty\u201f has become a \u201espatial \nmetaphor\u201f (Crump 2002), which subsumes the role of complex, generic social, \neconomic and political processes, and targets the individual failings of the poor \nwithin particular concentrated spaces, becoming a justification for their removal \nor dilution.  Imbroscio (2008) describes the discursive power of the concentrated \npoverty thesis in the US as a \u201edispersal consensus\u201f, which unites leftist \nacademics and city reformers with those on the right, and has provided \nlegitimacy to policies which change the spatial structures of cities through \nmarket forces.   A particular target of Imbroscio\u201fs criticism is the US federal \ngovernment\u201fs HOPE VI urban revitalization programme. This granted-aided 600 \nprojects in US cities between 1993 and 2006 with the aim of eradicating severely \n                                            \n13\n For Wilson (1987; 1996), the poor have social pathologies geared towards deviance away from the \nmainstream (described as the \u201eunderclass\u201f), which (re)produce poverty, and which are compounded by \ntheir spatial concentration (`zones of concentrated poverty').  Key to this is their socio-spatial isolation as \nthere is no middle class with social norms that would reduce social pathologies. \n 9 \ndistressed public housing. From 1998 onwards it adopted an increasing focus on \ndemolition in order to deconcentrate poverty (Popkin et al. 2004).   Hope VI is \nworth mentioning here because direct learning from this programme through site \nvisits and exchanges was highly influential in the development of mixed \ncommunities policy in the UK (Lupton and Tunstall 2008).  However, its influence \ncan be seen not so much in the detail of the policy14  but in policy discourse.  \nTransatlantic learning from HOPE VI encouraged British policy-makers and civil \nservants to talk the language of \u201edeconcentrating poverty\u201f, of the need to take \nregeneration \u201cfurther and faster\u201d with a \u201cmore radical and intensive approach\u201d \n(ODPM 2005a p38) embracing extensive demolition.  It also helped shift the focus \nonto concentrated public housing.  Extensive demolition in order to restore \nfunctioning housing markets was already underway as part of the Housing Market \nRenewal programme, but typically in areas of low demand, low value, private \nhousing, and without a discourse of poverty or tenure deconcentration. \n \nA second neo-liberal feature of the mixed communities approach is its emphasis on the \nimportance of restoring market functionality both for the consumer, enabling choice \nwithin a diverse housing stock, and for the producer, opening up new construction \nmarkets.  The choice imperative is clearly articulated in the mixed communities \napproach: \n \n                                            \n14\n There are major differences between HOPE VI and MCI, most notably the absence in the UK of direct \ncentral government funding or any deliberate intention to disperse existing residents through assisted \nmoves. \n 10 \n\u201eThe aim is that success measures should be choice. Reputation, choice of \nstaying and that people want to move in \u2013 it\u201fs about market choice\u201f (Senior CLG \nofficial, quoted in Lupton et al. forthcoming  p 36).   \n \nA functioning market, it is argued, will make it easier to achieve social outcomes, such \nas improved school performance and reduced health inequalities, and to reduce the \nneed for repeated cycles of public spending (Berube 2005). Importantly, while service \nimprovements that the state can deliver (such as better schools and more attractive \nopen spaces) will play a part in creating this market, they are not sufficient.   Physical \nchange and diversity of housing type and tenure is essential to reposition the \nneighbourhood as a place of choice.  In this context the state\u201fs role is to not only to \ninvest directly, but to create a market by reducing the proportion of public housing, or to \nstimulate existing markets by improving and diversifying the housing stock (Shaw, \n2005).  In the mixed communities approach, intervention by the local state comes not \nonly in the form of investment in better services (sometimes as in the case of schools, \nwith the explicit goal that these will attract better-off residents) but through the sale or \ngift of land for private development. Following Peck and Tickell (2003), this implies \nthat neoliberalism as practice involves the contradictory process of market \nfunctionality and expansion depending on interventionist regulatory \ninstitutions.15  In tandem with the concentrated poverty discourse, the removal of \nconcentrated social housing through its sale to the private sector as part of a \nstate-managed regeneration programme not only provides a \u201cspatial fix for \n                                            \n15\n They represent what Peck and Tickell (2006) term the \u201edestructively creative process\u201f of roll-out state \nregulation that seeks to manage the contradictions of neoliberalism, but with institutional restructuring \n\u201eoften in the name of or in the image of the market\u201f (Peck and Tickell, 2003: 168). \n 11 \npoverty\u201d but \u201copens up valuable land for the construction of profitable mixed-\nincome housing developments\u201d (Crump 2002: 593). In such circumstances there \nis the potential for developers to adjust planned social housing in accordance \nwith market dynamics, but where the local state internalises risks through \nprovision of favourable conditions for developers (Dutton, 2003).  Such \nprocesses have the potential to be prolific as developers will favour the least \nproblematic sites because of the risks associated with marginal locations, the \nneed to make a profit and the cyclical nature of the property market (Adair et al, \n2003).   \n \n \nThe third, and closely related neo-liberal feature is the alignment of mixed communities \nwith the new urban agenda in the UK, as set out in the Urban White Paper of 2000 \n(DETR 2000) and reinforced through the Sustainable Communities plan (ODPM, 2003).  \nThe Urban White paper identifies mixed neighbourhoods, where people of all income \nlevels and life stages will choose to live, as essential to the revitalised city, and in doing \nso it shifts the emphasis of urban regeneration away from \u201ebottom-up\u201f approaches that \naim to improve neighbourhoods in the interests of current residents, to aligning \nneighbourhood change with the strategic needs of the city as a whole.  These needs are \nthemselves to be identified and met through a new urban entrepreneuralism  in which \ncity leaders move away from service delivery roles to envision and promote economic \ngrowth and competitiveness, creating the conditions for capital accumulation and \ninvestment. One such condition is the presence of the middle classes.    \n 12 \n \nNumerous critics have described the urban agenda of mixed communities as \n\u201estate-led\u201f or \u201etext-book\u201f gentrification (Wyly and Hammel, 2005; Atkinson, 2004; \nCameron 2003; Lees et al 2007; Davidson, 2008; Lees 2008).   Uitermark et al \n(2007), describing similar policies in Holland, found that improvement-based \ninterventions were subsumed by the construction of owner-occupied housing \nand demolition of social housing in order to create liveable, balanced \ncommunities.  These authors argued that the purpose of this intervention was \n\u201ccivilizing and controlling these neighbourhoods\u201d (ibid: 127) so that the local \nstate could achieve operational aims (such as renting property), and equated to \nwhat Atkinson and Bridge (2005) characterised as the colonisation of the city by \nthe middle classes.  For Blomley (2004) and Kearns and Mason (2007), such \npolicies are essentially about producing new housing markets through greater \nhomeownership, self-relience, community pride and entrepreneurship; and where \nthe middle class is presented as an morally superior and \u201eactive, responsible and \nimproving population of homeowners\u201f (Blomley, 2004: 89), in \u201econtrast to a \ndemonised working class or low income groups\u201f (Lees, 2008: 2463). \n \nResponsibilities for Dealing with Poverty and Place \n \nAs this account implies, the mixed communities approach to neighbourhood \nregeneration is not just about doing different things, but also about doing things in \ndifferent ways, with different institutional arrangements reflecting newly-defined  \n 13 \nresponsibilities of different actors: central and local state, business and the community.  \nThese different institutional arrangements potentially have a significant impact on the \nnature of governance arrangements, including issues around participation, legitimacy, \nstrategic focus and power relations (Newman, 2001).   \n \n\u201eImprovement-type\u201f approaches in the UK have typically been delivered via a top-down \nmechanism, involving central state grant-giving, target setting and monitoring, as well as \nstrong direction on programme activities. By contrast, the mixed communities approach \nparticularly emphasises the role of the local state, not just as one of many partners \nworking to central government priorities, but in a community leadership role, and in the \nabsence of strong nation state intervention. MCI DPs have no centrally determined \ntargets and no \u201ecash pot\u201f for which they are accountable.  Instead a more strategic \nand entrepreneurial approach is encouraged at the local level, with local \nauthorities typically taking responsibility for development and implementation, \nand engaging other partners.  Outcomes for particular neighbourhoods are \nintegrated with broader strategies for city revitalisation and competitiveness:  \n \n\u201c[MCI is] an approach that is not constrained by specific funding streams \nor area boundaries. It\u2019s possible to look at what the problem is and work \ntowards a solution\u2026 a wider and more comprehensive approach\u201d (DP \nProject Director, cited in Lupton et al forthcoming. \n \n 14 \nIn this way, the local state internalises some of the costs and risks of the market \nprocess18 by creating favourable conditions for developers to invest, on the \nunderstanding that later capital receipts will recoup actual spend and fund new \nsocial housing and other facilities and amenities.    This responsibility was \ndescribed by one stakeholder as having \u201ctaken the risk, been a loss leader\u201d (DP \nrepresentative,author interview), an interesting adoption of entrepreneurial \nlanguage.  It resonates with other accounts of \u201estate-led gentrification\u201f in which \nthe key role of the local state has been pointed out (Cameron 2003, Dutton, 2003 \nand Slater 2004).  Indeed, for Newman and Ashton (2004) the local state in \n\u201eresource-poor cities\u201f is critical in the gentrification process as it responds to a \npolicy discourse of \u201econcentrated poverty\u201f through the utilisation of market \nprocesses.   \n \nBy the same token, the mixed communities approach gives central importance to \nprivate sector involvement (Davidson and Lees, 2005; Davidson, 2008; Lees, \n2008).  Solutions to the problems of poor neighbourhoods through \ntransformational change are evidently dependent on capital and property market \ndynamics.  State-fostered and state-subsidised regeneration works in \ncombination with private capital to produce new urban landscapes (Smith, 2002; \nNewman and Ashton, 2005).  Wyly and Hammel (2005) have argued that this has \nimportant social implications in that urban policy decisions rely on middle class \nmarket demand, including the provision of public services. Moreover, \n                                            \n18\n Costs typically relate to the acquisition of properties for demolition, actual demolition and investing in \nenvironment improvements \n 15 \nprogrammes are likely to be heavily dependent on developer\u201fs willingness to \ninvest and the strength of the housing market in particular places and times.  \nJessop et al (1999) argue that market forces restrict the actions of local \ngovernment and other actors in the processes of physical urban regeneration, \nand there is considerable evidence that property developers have determined \nlocal agendas, given the resources they possess and the state privileging them a \ncentral role in networks (Anastacio et al, 2000; Adair et al, 2003).   \n \nA more central role for capital poses potential challenges for the role of community. \nMixed communities follows on the heels of the New Deal for Communities programme, \nin which area regeneration was intended to be community-influenced in partnership with \nagents of the local state, including local government.  In reality, community influence \nhas not been as strong as it might have been (Fuller and Geddes, 2008, Perrons and \nSkyers, 2003; Imrie and Raco, 2003), and indeed some commentators have interpreted \nNDCs as the spread of neoliberal principles through the devolution of responsibilities to \ncommunities, along with new forms of control at a distance by the state (Dean, 1999; \nRaco, 2003).   However, the contrast with MCI is striking.    MCI operates with no \nspecific central direction on governance arrangements. This may simply create a space \nfor local state agents, business and communities to construct their own tailored forms of \ninvolvement, with no reduction in community influence.  A more cynical view would be \nthat the lack of protection for community involvement is a function of the pragmatic \nrequirements of business (Newman 2001), or of the need to be driven by more strategic \nand city-wide concerns.   As Katz argued, community involvement may well be a part of \n 16 \na mixed communities approach, but neighbourhood transformation \u201crequires a dynamic, \nmarket-driven notion of neighbourhood change, rather than any \u201ecommunity control\u201f \nvision dedicated to maintaining the status quo\u201d (2004:26).    \n \n \nLocal Implementation  \n \n \n \nTransformational Approaches to Poverty and Place ? \n \nThe evaluation evidence suggests that the transformational goal of the mixed \ncommunities approach and the primacy of the market are firmly embedded in local \nplans.    All the DPs identified a high proportion of low income housing as inherently \nproblematic, regardless of current levels of demand, and their plans are designed to \ncreate functioning housing markets which will attract a broader range of households, \ncreating thriving and sustainable areas in which households with choice will want to live.     \n \nLevels of projected housing provision and demolition vary between DPs, but greater \nlevels of change are planned in areas with a majority of social housing. For instance, \n6000-8000 new homes are planned in the predominantly social housing area of \nNewham, compared with just 400 new dwellings in Sheffield where there is far more \nprivate tenure (see Table 1). In Coventry, approximately 1700 homes (mostly social \nhousing) are to be demolished and replaced with 3,630 new properties (the majority \n 17 \nbeing private), with some social housing units also being refurbished. The effect will be \nto increase owner-occupation from 14% to 60%.   \n \nThe extent of planned change in social housing areas certainly reflects the greater \nleverage of the local state in areas where it is the largest landlord.   However, it also \nreflects an understanding that lack of tenure mix is the major problem in such areas.     \nThis was the case partly because social housing was seen as concentrating poverty \u2013 in \nitself problematic.  For example the Canning Town Masterplan Supplementary Planning \nGuidance highlights problems with concentrations of deprivation and high levels of \nsocial rented tenure by Newham standards and the need to create a \u201cmixed and \nbalanced community\u201d. The strategy sets out to move tenure mix for the area from 67% \nto 50% social housing over a thirty year period.  Moving closer to the national average \nfor mix is in itself a goal.   Neighbourhood transformation is to be achieved by selling or \ngiving land to private developers and housing associations to enable tenure \ndiversification and to subsidise new or refurbished social housing and infrastructure. \nPartly, however, social housing was seen as inhibiting individual choice.  Thus, even \nwhere DPs did not envisage a large scale change in income mix, they wanted to, in the \nwords of the Canning Town DP, \u201censure genuine mixed tenure and to offer residents \nthe opportunity to make choices about their housing\u201d.  This would have the additional \neffect of making it less likely that aspirational families would move out of the areas to \nsatisfy their housing needs. \n \n 18 \nThere is also evidence in some cases of a more strategic and integrated approach than \nto previous neighbourhood regeneration initiatives.   Although some of the DPs have \nevolved out of previous neighbourhood-level initiatives, particularly NDCs, in several \ncases they are very closely integrated with and driven by strategies for economic \nregeneration in surrounding areas.  This is particularly clear in DPs such as Gipton \n(Leeds) and Burngreave (Sheffield) where there is an explicit focus on city-region \nhousing demands and economic competitiveness.  Gipton DP for instance forms \npart of the East and Southeast Leeds (EASEL) Regeneration Initiative, which itself \nforms part of the Leeds Regeneration Initiative.  Neighbourhood regeneration is \ndesigned not just to benefit existing residents but to change the image of the \narea, encourage new business investment, and open up housing opportunities \nfor incoming professional residents. \n \nHowever, in some DPs, the rhetoric around area transformation and the advantages of \nmixed communities per se is less strong.  The rationale for intervention is more \npragmatic and more focused on neighbourhood renewal rather than city revitalisation or \ngentrification.   One of the demonstration projects is in the Tees Valley, where the sub-\nregional economy has not recovered from de-industrialisation. The sub-region has a \nGVA per capita index of 71 compared with 102 for England as a whole21.   As well as a \nspatial shift in jobs, there has also been a re-structuring of the labour market with more \npart-time jobs and jobs held by women.  Large scale depopulation has occurred over \n                                            \n21 Note: GVA (Gross Value Added) per capita is a measure of economic prosperity. It is based on the \nvalue of goods and services produced in the area divided by the resident population.   \nhttp:\/\/www.statistics.gov.uk\/statbase\/Product.asp?vlnk=14650 \n \n 19 \nthe last twenty years, leading to low housing demand.  While there are plans for \neconomic growth, and some household growth is now anticipated, the underlying \nweaknesses of the economy are acknowledged.   The creation of a new mixed \ncommunity is seen as important in renewing and diversifying the housing stock, \nto enable choice, stem outflow of population, meet the needs of emerging \nhouseholds, and reorient three depleted communities around a new \u201egrowth pole\u201f \nof new housing, shops and community facilities.  In this sense it is hoped that the \narea will be transformed, and indeed a transformation of the image of the area is \nseen as essential. However, it is not anticipated that the area will be transformed \ninto one where much wealthier people will live and there is little rhetoric around \nthe value of a mixed community per se.  \n \nLocal state agents involved in delivering mixed community projects also expressed \nconcerns about the neo-liberal discursive positioning of existing working class \ncommunities within the mixed communities approach, and the need for the local state to \nproject their interests during neighbourhood transformation. This was sometimes \nexpressed as a threat of gentrification.  Such views were particularly prevalent where \nprojects were part of the NDC programme, and which had spent some years delivering \nan \u201eimprovement\u201f type approach with a strong emphasis on the local community \ndetermining the direction and nature of neighbourhood change.    Officers responsible \nfor delivering the projects expressed reservations at the possible deficit implication of \nthe \u201emixed communities\u201f approach:  \n \n 20 \n\u201cto be perfectly honest, going out speaking to members of the public I have \ngreat concerns about using that kind of language [mixed communities], \u2026 \nthey\u201fll actually think it\u201fs quite patronising \u2026\u2026.. basically, if you go out there, \nand say something like that, and they\u201fll say \u201cso what you saying then? \u2013 \nwe\u201fre a crap area? \u2013 we can\u201ft look after ourselves? \u2013 we\u201fre just a bunch of, \nyou know?\u201d  (Demonstration project)  \n \n\u201cI have anxieties about the way in which it is about displacing poor \npeople, you could only apply such plans in a poor community. It seems \nto be about displacing poor people into other poor places\u201d (authors\u201f \ninterview). \n \n \nAcceptance of the need to change areas, and the inevitable role of capital in financing \narea improvements, along with reservations about the implications for working-class \ncommunities, led to plans which protected the interests of people already living in the \nareas.  In all but one DP, housing plans in the projects involved no net loss of social \nhousing (because developments were built at higher density), in sharp contrast to the \nUS HOPE VI programme where displacement was an explicit objective and residents \nwere given vouchers to move elsewhere. In some DPs, charters had been agreed to \ngive original residents a right to housing in the new development.    \n \nEspecially in \u201ewell-connected\u201f areas (inner suburbs with a potential for \ngentrification) there were concerns about affordability as land values rose, and \n 21 \ntherefore that polarisation rather than mix would occur, as people on moderate \nincomes and not in social rented homes progressively become squeezed out of \nthe market.  Too wide a \u201emix\u201f was seen as potentially problematic: \n \n\u201cWith the mixed community I\u2019m also worried about the huge contrast \nbetween people I\u2019m not sure if they will mix at all. There is quite a fear \nthing between communities, and new residents will be commuting and \nso won\u2019t be around to contribute, there may end up being mentally \ngated areas\u201d (authors\u2019 interview). \n \nHowever, these concerns had not yet been reflected in measures to retain equity in the \npublic sector or have it retained by developers with profits on subsequent sales recycled \ninto community infrastructure.  Concerns about the approach had not been converted \ninto actual policies. One demonstration project was interested in securing the freedom \nto retain stamp duty on properties built under mixed communities.  The quotation \nillustrates sensitivity to the trade-off between neighbourhood and city interests and the \ndesire to have this recognised in some appropriately redistributive policy mechanism: \n \n\u201cBut, actually, it\u201fs a way of saying, you know, this local community has been \npart of raising values, it\u201fs gone through the pain, it\u201fs gone through the \ndifficult demolitions, it\u201fs coming out the other side.  It\u201fs raised the profile of \nthe area in terms of the city and it\u201fs also raised investment potential, so why \nnot benefit from some of that?  And retaining stamp duty for those properties \n 22 \nthat have been built as part of the Mixed Communities program that could \npay for five years of concerted approach on neighbourhood arrangements \nfor the neighbourhood side of it.    (DP representative)  \n \n \nA new institutional landscape? \n \nThus, while adopting a mixed communities approach, some local projects were \nattempting to design local interventions that would limit any potential negative effects.  \nThey were adapting to mixed communities as plans unfolded.  \n \nInstitutional arrangements in the DPs also appeared to indicate a transitional phase \nwhere new relationships are evolving, contested and uncertain.  In one sense, local \nauthorities appeared to be welcoming the new urban entrepreneurial role that urban and \nlocal government policies were extending to them.  DPs welcomed the opportunity of a \nmore creative approach in which local authorities could work beyond specific funds or \nboundaries and \u201clook at what the problem is and work towards a solution\u201d (DP official). \nThey were integrating people-based initiatives and funding streams (from primary health \ncare trusts, for example) within their area masterplans, and in some cases thinking \nabout longer term strategic integration. For example, in one area, the local authority\u201fs \nhousing function was being incorporated into a community care directorate, recognising \nthe need to tackle place characteristics not in isolation but as an aspect of individual \nwell-being. \n 23 \n \nHowever, the limits of this new localism were also evident.  A particular feature of the \ndemonstration projects is that they are to be offered new \u201cfreedoms and flexibilities\u201d to \nenable local creativity and solutions tailored to local problems.  However the kinds of \nfreedoms that projects want are hard for central government to grant within existing \nlegislative frameworks or without creating inequity between local authority areas.  For \none local authority, at least, this meant that the mixed communities approach to \nparticular neighbourhoods must be incorporated within the Local Area Agreement \nstructure for governance of local authority areas, even though this was likely to \nconstrain local flexibility, and enable more central direction.  Having welcomed what \nappeared to be a chance to work independently from central government, some DPs \nwere recognising the necessity to negotiate freedoms by operating within a more \ncentrally-determined framework.   \n \n\u201cI would say that the Mixed Community programme should \u2026 definitely fit with \nLAA, because one of the, sort of, dangled carrots for Mixed Communities was \nthat we would get additional freedoms and flexibilities in line with the local \narea agreements and going beyond that. Well we haven\u201ft seen that, have we, \nto date?\u201d (Local authority) \n  \nAnother interviewee observed that creative joining-up of programmes locally was \ndifficult in the absence of the same level of co-ordination at the national level.  Thus \nspending programmes of the Department for Children, Schools and Families or the \n 24 \nHome Office were not currently determined by neighbourhood renewal\/mixed \ncommunities imperatives, making it difficult for local projects to tie in new schools, for \nexample, with new mixed housing developments.  Given strong centrally driven \nprogrammes and policy objectives, local freedom to take a place-based approach \ncannot operate unless concerns with integrating programmes at a neighbourhood level \nhave a higher priority at the centre: \n \n\u201cMCI should be linked to \u201eBuilding Schools for the Future\u201f and Home Office \ninitiatives to design out crime. Some of this is happening locally but it varies \u2013 \nthere\u201fs no real leadership from Government\u201d (Government Office) \n \nHowever, joining programmes at a central level might well have the effect that local \nprojects end up delivering joined-up programmes for neighbourhoods that have already \nbeen determined at the central level.   These tensions between central and local \nresponsibilities have clearly still to be worked out. \n \nDemonstration projects also expressed concerns about the shifting role of the local \nstate in relation to capital interests.  All were actively practising the neo-liberal approach \nof using public funds to attract and create the conditions for the investment of private \ncapital, as explicitly stated for the Leeds DP: \nEASEL is fundamentally a market driven regeneration programme. Its \nprimary aim is to create a successful housing market where increasing \nvalues will realise the financial return needed \u2026 to fund regeneration \n 25 \ninvestment (Report of the Director of Neighbourhoods & Housing \nExecutive Board: Leeds City Council, February, 2007). \n \nIn mixed tenure areas where the local state did not own large amounts of property, this \ntook the form of investing in area improvements (demolishing empty properties, \ndisplacing drug and sex markets and strengthening policing, cleaning up \u201eeyesore\u201f sites,  \ninvesting in schools, planning transport improvements and restoring historic buildings).     \nAs mentioned above, there was a general perception of DPs being \u201eloss leader\u201f  in \nfinancing these kinds of improvements to create the conditions for a mixed community:   \n \nOf course the key to market uplift is improvement to the existing state \nand image of the area. The success of EASEL is therefore dependant on \nupfront investment to address the issues most critical to the housing \nmarket; particularly the quality of place, the performance of local \nschools, the availability of high quality convenient shops and services \nand good transport links (Report of the Director of Neighbourhoods & \nHousing Executive Board: Leeds City Council, February, 2007) \n \nIn the evaluation research, DPs did not contest this approach in principle.  However, \nthey did acknowledge that this was a risky strategy, since it depended on land values \nrising sufficiently to deliver later parts of the programme.  Reliance on private capital to \ndeliver programmes could push DPs into agreeing deals with developers in order to \nease cash flow problems. \n 26 \n \n\u201cUntil we sign a deal with the developers, we don\u201ft have money. There is a \ndanger of signing a deal to take the heat out and risk getting not such a good \ndeal\u2026\u201d.(Demonstration Project). \n \nUltimately, they might also invest public funds and risk schemes falling through if the \nhousing market did not support further phases of development.  This was obviously a \nparticular concern in weaker housing markets, but the inevitability of dependence on \nprivate capital was not challenged.  The potential risks here have become much \nclearer in recent times as the  \u201ecredit crunch\u201f has begun to impact, and the \npotential divergence between capital and local state aims becomes more evident.   \n \nPerhaps the most uncertain area in institutional terms was how the roles of local state, \ncapital and community would be resolved in governance arrangements for mixed \ncommunities.   Some projects had engaged in extensive consultation processes and \nestablished neighbourhood-level governance boards with resident representation, in the \nmode of New Deal for Communities.  Indeed, this governance model was most evident \nwhere DPs had evolved from existing NDCs.  The new approach was being adopted \nwithin the old structures. Notably, it was in these cases where residents\u201f charters were \nbeing adopted to resolve tensions between capital and community.  While these \nprotected residents\u201f rights to new housing, if desired, there was a great deal of \ndiscretion for capital and the local state to change aspects of the plan, because \ncommunities had no legal rights (to be consulted and influence decisions) \n 27 \nbeyond the right to new housing.  In other areas, projects exemplified top-down \nstrategic planning, with consultation opportunities on strategic plans produced \nby local authorities, but no neighbourhood level structures for residents to be \nengaged in initial visioning or involved in ongoing governance.  Here, the active \ninvolvement of the community seemed to have been suppressed in the formation \nof close partnerships between local state and private capital to deliver strategic \nchange.  Thus, in the case of Sheffield DP the amount of social \nhousing\/affordable housing has been reduced to 20%, with little input of \nresidents into this process as discussions largely took place within the city \ncouncil and various city-wide partnerships that did not include residents from the \nDP area.  \n \nIn DP areas it is left to either the limited resources of local authority regeneration and \ncommunity engagement teams, or the NDC, to develop the ability of communities to \nengage in the MCI process.  An example of this is Coventry DP where as the main \nlocal body it has been left to the NDC, with support from the city council and RSL, \nto develop the capacity of this group.  Only recently has terms of reference and a \ncode of conduct been developed for the group, along with chair and vice-chair \npositions, all of which were developed by an NDC community capacity builder.  \nThis follows the NDC programme in that there is devolved responsibility to \ndevelop the capacity to act, but is based on an assumption that local \ncommunities are willing to act.  In this sense there is a tangible belief that \ninvolved residents are representative of the local community, and thus there have \n 28 \nbeen no efforts to ensure a systematic mechanism for ensuring that they are in \nfact representative.   \n \nOf further interest in the future will be the accountability arrangements of joint venture \ncompanies for redevelopment that some DPs are adopting as \u201especial delivery vehicles\u201f \nfor mixed communities, and which encapsulate the relations between capital, state and \ncommunities.  These structures are emergent, and it is not yet clear how \ncommunity representation will be organised in these or how the community will \nbe able to call them to account.  An interesting example occurs in Coventry DP \nwhere there is no joint venture company between all partners, but a \u201edevelopment \nagreement\u201f which sits between the Registered Social Landlord (RSL) and the \nthree developers, with a back-to-back stakeholder agreement between the NDC, \nRSL and the City Council.  This focus on pragmatic structures reduces \ngovernance to market-based contractual relations.  A core strategic group of the \nthree developers, RSL, city council and NDC is the main governance group for \nthe DP.  This group includes the regional Managing Directors of the developers \nand is considered the main arena in which there are discussions around \nreviewing the financial model and making subsequent decisions, but with no \nactual involvement from the community and voluntary sectors.  This is not an \natypical governance arrangement, but represents the creation of new governing \nspaces in the regeneration of deprived areas, where the relationship between \ncommunity, capital and state is being reconfigured towards the latter two, with \ninvolvement from communities far more reactive and piece-meal.   \n 29 \n \n \nConclusions  \n \nThe mixed communities approach  represents a  shift in ideology about poverty and \nplace problems that is more neo-liberal than New Labour\u201fs previous interventions, \nimplying new roles for capital and community and being played out in the context of \nchanging central\/local relations that support urban entrepreneurialism, but within \npotentially tighter central government control.  It is certainly the case that the \nprogramme represents a renewed focus on concentrated poverty as the cause of \ndeprivation, and the enactment of market functionality (through the promotion of largely \nmiddle class homeownership) and processes of gentrification as solutions, with the \nmiddle class viewed as being able to produce beneficial effects on those residents that \nare not displaced.  At the local level, local state agents are enacting this approach, but \nwith some reservations, and with some uncertainty as new institutional relationships \nevolve.  It is not entirely clear how the policy will take shape and with what effect at local \nlevel.  The transition between the NDC \u201eimprovement\u201f approach and the \u201emixed \ncommunities \u201etransformation\u201f approach may represent what Brenner and Theodore \n(2002) have described as the \u201eneoliberalisation of urban space\u201f as emergent neoliberal \ntendencies seek to dissolve inherited institutional arrangements that lay beyond \nneoliberalism.   \n \n 30 \nIt is highly likely that local dynamics will lend different forms to this new neo-liberalism in \ndifferent areas as \u201cnew political forms emerge out of struggle, rather than being \nimposed in a top-down manner\u201d (Larner, 2005:11).   Local mixed community projects \nare, in a sense, new local sites of contestation in which neoliberal tendencies compete \nwith alternate political imaginaries and practices (Leitner et al, 2006).  However a key \nand consistent concern must be the subordination of local interests as a process of re-\nscaling goes on in urban and regeneration policy, with the neighbourhood \u2013 a key \nfeature of earlier New Labour interventions \u2013 being supplemented and subsumed by \ncity-region and region scales. With capital likely to have an increasing role in \ngovernance arrangements, there is clearly potential for a new disempowerment of \ncommunities, through what Harvey (2000) describes as a \u201edeep substratum of coerced \nco-operations and collaborations\u201f (p 181), in which certain agents are favoured, while \nothers are disempowered.  Resolving this tension between neighbourhood and strategic \ninterests, community and capital, is a key challenge for the forms of Third Way politics \ncharacterising the nation state.  This is obviously set against a backdrop of \ncontinuing problems in the housing market.  One potential consequence of this is \na move by local state authorities to internalise further risks in the hope of \ninducing developers to build housing in marginal locations, while also further \nincreasing the bargaining power of capital relative to the local state and \ncommunities.  On the other hand, increased demand for affordable housing along \nwith a shortage of private sector investment may lead to increasing central state \nintervention and a reduced emphasis on tenure deconcentration.  How this plays \nout remains to be seen. \n 31 \n \n \nReferences \n \nAdair, A., Berry, J. and McGreal, S.
