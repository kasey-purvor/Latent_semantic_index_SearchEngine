However, subsequent work on the profitability of customers \nhas shown that some customers are very unprofitable. This leaves managers with a \nproblem: how to focus their relationship management efforts to maximise shareholder \nvalue. A suggested theoretical approach is to view the customer base as an investment \nportfolio. This paper uses the portfolio management model of risk and return to explore \nthe measurement of returns and of the risk of the customer. Some implications for CRM \nmanagers are outlined. \n \nKey words: Customer Relationship Management (CRM), customer profitability, \ncustomer risk, customer portfolio. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe emergence of Relationship Marketing with its emphasis on customer retention \n(Reichheld, 1993; Christopher et al., 1991) has sparked considerable interest in the \nrelationship between customer retention and increased profitability (for example, \nBlattberg and Deighton, 1996; Reichheld, 1996; Reichheld, 1993; Reichheld and Sasser, \n2  \n1990).  More recently, it has been suggested that a company\u2019s relationships with its \ncustomers are one of its most important assets (Srivastava et al., 1998; Hunt, 1997; \nKutner and Cripps, 1997) and that pro-active management of the customer relationship \nthat leads to greater customer satisfaction can increase the profitability of the firm as a \nwhole (e.g. Ittner and Larcker, 1998). This has encouraged companies to view their \nrelationships with customers as assets in themselves (Hunt, 1997; Kutner and Cripps, \n1997) which are capable of management. More recently, it has been suggested that one \nof the primary purposes of marketing is the delivery of shareholder value (Doyle, 2000) \nthrough customer relationship management (Srivastava et al., 1999). \n \nIf customer relationships are assets, how do they compare with the other business assets? \nAlthough not valued on the balance sheet, customer relationships share characteristics \nwith other business assets and, in particular, with brand assets. Intuitively, customer \nrelationships and brand relationships should have a lot in common. Both generate cash \nflow and profit for the business; both are intangible and difficult to measure. These two \nmarketing assets differ, though, in the degree of recognition and the consequent attitude \nof companies to their measurement. The measurement of brand assets and brand equity is \nconsidered a topic of major importance to companies and to shareholders and has \nreceived considerable coverage (for two examples in a large field see Ward and Ryals, \n2001 and Murphy, 1989) and it is recognised that brands need investment.  \n \nBy contrast, despite discussion of the importance of customer profitability measurement \nand calls for measuring the financial impact of marketing strategies (Sheth and Sharma, \n2001) and for marketing\u2019s central function in building customer relationships \n(Varadarajan and Jayachandran, 1999; Webster, 1992), most companies do not yet \n3  \nmeasure the value of their customer relationships.  Proponents of relationship marketing \nand of customer retention have argued that retained customers are more profitable \n(Reichheld, 1993; Reichheld, 1996; Reichheld and Sasser, 1990; Peppers and Rogers, \n1995).  However, more recent work has demonstrated that retained customers are not \nnecessarily more profitable and what matters is how customers are managed (Reinartz \nand Kumar, 2000; Reinartz and Kumar, 2002; Leszinski et al., 1995).  \nAs the foregoing discussion illustrates, the measurement of customer profitability is a \nsignificant topic in its own right and is linked to the management of customer \nrelationships (Gupta et al., 2001; Rust et al., 2001; Zeithaml et al., 2001; Mulhern, \n1999) and the considerable field of CRM (Ryals et al., 2000). Whilst these two fields \nare of interest in the current context, the purpose of this paper is to draw a further \nparallel between brands and customer relationships, the notion of the portfolio. It is \ncommonplace for marketing managers to discuss the brand portfolio and the \nmeasurement and management of this portfolio, the impact of brand extensions on the \nperformance of the overall portfolio, etc. (see, for example, Davidson, 1997). It is more \nunusual for marketing managers to discuss their customer portfolio. \n \nMarketing portfolio analysis \nPortfolio analysis is the process of reviewing a group of investments, usually with a \nview to making asset management or resource allocation decisions.  In marketing, \nportfolio analysis has tended to focus on product portfolios, such as the Boston Matrix.  \nOther authors have recognised the importance of customer attractiveness (profitability, \ngrowth, etc.) but have discussed this largely in qualitative terms (for example, Fiocca, \n1982). \n4  \n \nQuantitative portfolio analysis was popularised through the work of Nobel Laureate \nWilliam Sharpe in the early 1960s (Sharpe, 1964).  Sharpe\u2019s work is associated with \nModern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and with the capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).  \nThe work is based on share portfolios;  essentially, MPT suggests that investors will aim \nto maximise returns for a given level of risk.  Rational investors will demand higher \nreturns for higher levels of risk;  they will also prefer the lower-risk of any two \ninvestments which have the same returns, and prefer the higher return investment of any \ntwo which have the same risk.  The CAPM shows how the required return can be \ncalculated (Brealey, 1983; Sharpe, 1981). \n \nAlthough MPT has been enormously influential in financial markets, its influence in the \nfields of management and marketing has been limited.  The work of Larr\u00e9ch\u00e9 and \nSrinivasan is an exception;  they call for the application of quantitative portfolio \nanalysis using discounted cash flow techniques and discuss the application to business \nunit sales and marketing expenditure (Larr\u00e9ch\u00e9 and Srinivasan, 1981 and 1982).  More \nrecently, Dhar and Glazer (2003) have proposed treating the customer portfolio as a \nshare portfolio. \n \nThis paper builds on the work of Larr\u00e9ch\u00e9 and Srinivasan and Dhar and Glazer and \napplies MPT to marketing.  Specifically, it argues for a parallel between the \nmeasurement and management of the customer portfolio and the measurement and \nmanagement of share portfolios.  In particular, this paper will build on the current work \non customer lifetime value and the customer portfolio (for example, Lemon et al., 2001) \n5  \nand will draw on portfolio theory to argue that the risk of the customer should play an \nimportant part in the measurement and management of the value of individual \ncustomers and of the customer portfolio. \n \nFinancial portfolio management and the customer portfolio \nIn share portfolio management, there are two levels of management:  the overall risk \nand return profile of the portfolio, and the measurement and management of the \nconstituent shares (for example, Brealey, 1983; Sharpe, 1981).  Both risk and returns are \nactively managed.  This paper argues that the same should be true of the customer \nportfolio; the overall risk and returns of the customer portfolio should be a matter for \nmarketing measurement and management, as well as the relationships with individual \ncustomers. \n \nThe management of customers as portfolios is not unknown.  For example, in the \nfinancial services industry in the management of credit relationships that mortgage, loan \nand credit card customers have with banks, where the measurement and management of \nthe risk as well as return of the overall portfolio is taken very seriously. The overall risk \nand return profile of the customer portfolio in these cases drives decisions about how \nmany and which customers to accept; individual customer profitability and risk \ndetermines how those customers are managed by the lender.   \n \nThis paper explores the application of Modern Portfolio Theory to a portfolio of \ncustomers or customer segments and demonstrates that MPT and CAPM can be usefully \napplied to a customer portfolio.  Using MPT and CAPM, the paper argues that the \noverall risk and returns of the customer portfolio are important and two methodologies \n6  \nfor analysing customer risk are presented and analysed.  Finally, the managerial \nimplications of MPT for marketing are examined.  Risk and return analysis would allow \nmarketing managers to raise issues about which types of customers are under-\nrepresented in the portfolio, which customers are over-represented, which customers are \nnot represented at all and which customers are in the portfolio but perhaps should not \nbe.  Drawing on parallels from the management of share portfolios and on practical \nexamples from the customer portfolio management practices of the financial services \nindustry, the paper suggests how portfolio management can help CRM managers \nmaximise their returns from customers. \n \n \nRISK AND RETURNS IN THE CUSTOMER PORTFOLIO \n \nAs previously discussed, one of the most influential theories in portfolio management is \nMPT and the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).  In CAPM, high risk investments \nare associated with higher returns, which rational investors require to compensate them \nfor taking on higher risk (Brealey, 1983).  The risk\/return trade-off of MPT is important \nin determining marketing resource allocation to maximise shareholder value.  High \nreturn marketing investments may seem unduly attractive unless the concomitant risk is \nalso taken into account.  Focusing marketing investment on certain customers or \nsegments may be attractive in the short-term but may lead to problems medium to \nlonger term if these customers are inherently riskier than others.  To apply modern \nportfolio theory to the management of customer relationships, managers need to know \nhow to identify both customer returns and customer risk.  The application of CAPM to \n7  \nthe customer portfolio and methods of evaluating customer returns and customer risk \nwill now be discussed. \n \nIn CAPM, returns on a share are measured in terms of the increase in capital value of \nthe share plus the income received in the form of dividends.  Customer returns are \nusually measured either as customer profitability or customer lifetime value. However, \ncustomer profitability, a single-period measure of the returns from a customer, can be \nvery misleading as a guide to the total value of that relationship (Wilson, 1996). \nCustomers may be unprofitable in one year because of one-off factors such as the cost \nof acquisition (if the customer is new) or perhaps some customer-specific factor (for \nexample, if the customer is in temporary financial difficulties and purchase volumes \nfall faster than servicing costs). Single-period measurement of customer profitability \nmay not be a reliable guide to the true value of that customer. A better measure of \ncustomer returns is, therefore, customer lifetime value, defined as the stream of profits \nover the course of the relationship lifetime.  \n \nMethodology \nThe application of MPT and the CAPM to a customer portfolio took place during a \nlongitudinal, collaborative research project with the customer management team of a \nleading insurance company (Ryals, 2002b).  Throughout the project lifetime of 18 \nmonths, the application of MPT and CAPM was carried out through researcher \ninterventions with the Customer Delivery Team (CDT) and auxiliary team members, as \nappropriate.  Researcher interventions included workshops, face-to-face interviews and \nthe iteration of 22 spreadsheets to arrive at customer lifetime value (returns) adjusted \nfor risk.  In total, researcher intervention occurred on 14 separate occasions. \n8  \n \nThe accuracy of quantitative data was checked in two ways.  Successive versions of a \nspreadsheet (Microsoft Excel) were fed back to members of the CDT and their views \nsolicited.  This led to considerable changes in the customer revenue and cost forecasts.  \nOther quantitative data were checked for accuracy of calculation and transcribed by a \nthird party who had data entry experience. \n \nMeasuring returns from the customer portfolio \nThis section includes examples of customer risk and returns calculations carried out by \nthe customer development team (Ryals, 2002b).  The first step in applying CAPM to \nthe customer portfolio is to measure returns from the customer portfolio by estimating \nthe relationship lifetime and forecast likely revenues, costs and hence customer \nprofitability each year for the lifetime of the relationship.  Customer lifetime value has \nthree elements:  duration of relationship, revenues, and costs.  Relationship duration \ncan be forecast by the key account manager or extrapolated from previous experience.  \nRevenues are a function of actual and anticipated product or service sales.  Customer-\nspecific costs are more difficult, since most organisations are not able to identify the \nprecise costs of servicing their individual customers.  Tracking customer-specific costs \nis a live issue for CRM managers although technology can help. For example, call \ncentre and sales force automation systems can automatically identify time spent, \ncustomer by customer.  \n \nTable 1 shows the returns forecast for a major customer, a charitable foundation. \n \n9  \n[Table 1: Measuring customer lifetime value] \n \nThe total value of the customer portfolio, or customer equity of the firm, can be \ncalculated as the sum of the individual customer lifetime values (Lemon et al., 2001).  \nHowever, MPT and the CAPM model suggests that customer lifetime value, or \ncustomer equity, may be an inadequate measure of the true value of the customer. \nCustomer lifetime value and customer equity is about a profit stream, but MPT and \nCAPM says that risk, as well as returns, must be taken into account if shareholder value \nis to be created. When calculating the lifetime value of a relationship with a specific \ncustomer a discount rate is usually applied to future profits to determine customer \nlifetime value (see Table 1) but this discount rate does not necessarily bear any \nnecessary relationship to the risk of the customer.  The application of MPT and the \nCAPM to the customer portfolio means that the returns from a customer should be \nadjusted for the risk of that customer.  This risk assessment has not hitherto been \nincorporated into customer lifetime value and customer equity calculations.  Two \napproaches to assessing the risk of a customer will now be described;  later, the way in \nwhich each approach was applied to the insurance company\u2019s key customer portfolio \nwill be discussed. \n \nAssessing the risk of a customer \nMany companies assess the risk of their customers using some form of risk or credit \nscoring.  Risk scoring is an effective way of evaluating certain specific types of risk in \na customer relationship, normally the risk of default.  \n \n10  \nHowever, other types of risk associated with a customer, such as the risk of defection or \npurchasing swings, may not be captured by traditional risk scoring. Therefore, for \nmarketing purposes and for the development of customer management strategies, it \nmay be valuable to use a method for assessing customer risk that forces managers to \ndefine and evaluate customer risk for themselves (McNamara and Bromiley, 1999).  \n \nThis evaluation can take one of two forms.  Either the discount rate used to calculate \ncustomer lifetime value can be adjusted for the risk associated with that customer or \nsegment, or the risk evaluation can be expressed as a probability of obtaining the \nforecast future revenue stream from that customer or segment.  Each method will now \nbe discussed. \n \nThe CAPM expresses the risk of a share in terms of its beta.  The beta measures the \nvolatility of share price movements relative to a benchmark (for example, to a stock \nmarket index).  A share with a beta of 1.0 will be expected to move in line with the \nindex;  a share with a beta of 1.5 is riskier and will be expected to move 1.5 times as \nmuch as the index.  For this reason, high beta shares are preferred in rising stock \nmarkets and low beta shares (which move less than the index) are preferred in falling \nstock markets.  Betas are calculated by observing historic share price movements \nrelative to the index over the previous 5 years.  It is theoretically possible to calculate \ncustomer betas in the same way, relative to the customer portfolio (Dhar and Glazer, \n2003), but such data does not exist in most companies (Reinartz and Kumar, 2000) and \ndid not exist in the insurance company participating in the study.  Therefore, drawing \non McNamara and Bromiley\u2019s (1999) approach, a risk assessment exercise was devised \nin which the customer managers identified a set of risk factors, gave each factor an \n11  \nimportance weighting, and then scored each customer against each risk factor.  The risk \nfactors included how well managed the customer\u2019s business was;  how much the \ncustomer managers knew about the customer;  the risk that the customer would be \ntaken over and would change suppliers;  and the relationship with the customer.  The \nweighted risk score for each customer was then calculated relative to the average \n(unweighted)1 risk score for the customer portfolio.  The application of the first \napproach to risk adjustment (adjusting discount rates to reflect customer risk) will now \nbe discussed. \n \nAdjusting discount rates to reflect customer risk \nTo adjust the discount rate for the risk of a customer, a weighted risk score can be used. \nFor example, if the average weighted risk score is 6.00, a customer with a weighted \nscore of 9.00 could be assigned a risk loading that is 50% higher than average. \nTherefore, if the company\u2019s discount rate is 10%, the discount rate applied to the risky \ncustomer could be 15% (10% x 9.0\/6.0). Table 2 demonstrates the impact that risk-\nadjusted discount rates could have on the measurement of customer lifetime value for a \ncustomer that is 50% riskier than the portfolio average. \n \n \n[Table 2: Measuring customer lifetime value using risk-adjusted discount rates] \n \nAs Table 2 illustrates, even quite a substantial change in the risk-adjusted discount rate \nfrom 10% to 15% would not result in a major change to the customer lifetime value.  \n                                                 \n1 In the interests of simplicity.  Portfolio betas in CAPM are expressed in weighted terms. \n12  \nThe impact of a 50% increase in the discount rate is to reduce the customer lifetime \nvalue by 10% from \u00a3422,000 to \u00a3379,000. \n \nRisk-adjusted discount rates are analogous to applying CAPM to a customer portfolio, \nalthough the analogy is imperfect, as described above.  However, risk-adjusted discount \nrates have two drawbacks.  The first is that the impact on customer lifetime value is \nsmall.  This is because, typically, forecast future lifetimes are relatively short.  In \naddition, risk-adjusted discount rates have a second major drawback, which is that risk \nis calculated relative to the customer portfolio average.  Changes in the portfolio \naverage (losing or gaining customers) may result in changes to the apparent risk and \nreturns of all remaining customers. This may not be a problem where customers are \nvery numerous, as shares on a stock market are, but can be a serious drawback to the \nuse of this method where relatively few key accounts are to be considered.  Each time a \ncustomer enters (or leaves) the customer portfolio, the risk of all the customers would \nhave to be recalculated leading to changes in apparent lifetime value. \n \nThere is a considerable body of finance literature that explores the shortcomings of \nCAPM (Jagannathan and McGrattan, 1995).  Recent criticism has focused upon MPT\u2019s \napproach to risk evaluation which treats upside and downside risk as equally \nundesirable, whereas Prospect Theory has shown that investors are far more concerned \nabout downside risk (Leggio and Lien, 2003).  The risk factor analysis presented above \nand subsequent discussions with the customer delivery team revealed that the main risk \nthey identified was the extreme downside risk of losing the customer. \n \n13  \nThus, a second approach to adjusting for customer risk was developed.  This is to \nexpress customer risk in terms of a probability of obtaining the future profit stream.  \nThis method will now be discussed. \n \nIntroducing probability forecasting to reflect customer risk \nWhere future profits from a customer relationship are uncertain, a forecasting \nprobability method may be used.  The forecasting probability method can be \noperationalised using a process analogous to the development of a risk scorecard.  \nCustomer managers are asked to evaluate the riskiness of a customer on a series of \nmeasures. In the case of the insurance company these focused on factors that might \nincrease or reduce customer defection risk and included the number of contacts that \ncustomer has with the company, how warm the relationship is, the number of products \npurchased, and the amount known about the customer.  A probability is then assigned \nto forecast profits in each future year of the customer\u2019s relationship lifetime, based on \nthese responses (Table 3).  These probabilities were assigned based on discussions with \nthe customer delivery team and a senior actuary and, for consistency with the previous \nrisk assessment approach, an unweighted average probability of renewal is used. \n \n[Table 3: Measuring customer lifetime value using forecast probability] \n \nEven if the probability of retaining the customer is comparatively high (in Table 3, it is \n90% for the first two years then 75% in the following two years of the relationship \nlifetime), using probability-adjusted forecasts has a considerable impact on the present \nvalue of the relationship with that customer.  As Table 3 shows, the customer lifetime \nvalue falls from \u00a3422,000 to \u00a3344,000 (26%) using this approach to measurement. \n14  \nMore risky customers would have lower probability percentages and, hence, still lower \ncustomer lifetime values.   \n \n \nMANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS \n \nThe managerial implications of risk-adjusting customer lifetime value will be \nconsidered at the level of the overall customer portfolio and of the individual customer.  \nCalculating total customer equity based on the risk-adjusted customer lifetime value for \na customer portfolio may reveal that the customer portfolio, as currently constituted, \nmay not deliver profits targets in future years.  This then gives the CRM manager two \nstrategic choices for customer risk management: to try to reduce the risk of the current \nportfolio of customers; or to try to acquire less risky customers.  Both strategies will \nhave the impact of increasing risk-adjusted customer equity; the question for the CRM \nmanager is then how to do this using the most efficient allocation of marketing \nresources. \n \nAn example from the research participants may serve to illustrate how risk-adjusted \ncustomer lifetime value can raise urgent issues for customer managers.  One key \ncustomer\u2019s probability of retention was calculated at 75% falling to 50% in two years.  \nThis discovery led to a discussion about how the customer manager should spend her \ntime;  based on the analysis, the manager herself suggested that she should spend half \nher time trying to manage the existing relationship and half on trying to find a new \n(replacement) customer. \n \n15  \nDeveloping risk-aware CRM strategies \nRisk-aware strategies for CRM fall into two broad categories: risk reduction, and risk-\nbased pricing.  Risk reduction can be thought of as reducing the risk of losing the \ncustomer (relationship management), whereas risk-based pricing can be thought of as \nreducing the damage potential to the company of risky customers. The precise mix of \nstrategies that are used for individual customers or for customer segments will depend \non the risk factors identified during the customer risk measurement exercise. \n \nRisk reduction strategies are becoming more common a part of CRM.  One example \nconcerns Wesleyan Insurance Society, a medium-sized provider of life and pensions \nproducts based in Birmingham in the Midlands of the UK.  Wesleyan, which has won \nseveral awards for its CRM systems, wanted to reduce customer defections. An analysis \nof several months of data on customers who had defected used micro-pattern matching \nto identify certain key behavioural characteristics.  From this, an algorithm was \ndeveloped that identifies similar behaviour patterns in current customers who may be \nthinking of defecting. Customer records from these customers are transferred to a \nrelationship recovery team (Ryals, 2002a). \n \nRisk-based pricing is used to a greater or lesser extent by many financial services \ninstitutions; risky customers may have to pay more for insurance or loans than less \nrisky customers.  Some very risky customers may even be refused insurance.  This is, \nhowever, the exception rather than the rule. In many cases, very risky customers can be \nmanaged by setting special terms (through higher pricing, or limiting the insurance \ncompany\u2019s exposure to the risk through higher excess or limited cover). In other \n16  \nindustries, companies routinely manage the risk of individual customers by setting \ndiffering credit limits.   \n \nThe presence of risky customers in the customer portfolio is inevitable.  Just because a \ncustomer is risky does not mean that they cannot be a profitable customer.  In fact, to \ngrow business quickly will often entail taking on customers who are more risky or \nwhose risk is unknown.  However, portfolio theory says that the overall risk profile of \nthe portfolio is critical. Higher-risk share portfolios perform better when times are good \nand worse when times are bad than low-risk portfolios.  The same may well be true of \ncustomer portfolios.  \n \n \nLIMITATIONS \n \nThe analogy between financial portfolios and customer portfolios is, this paper argues, \nuseful in bringing the notion of customer risk to the attention of CRM managers and in \nhelping them to develop customer strategies to manage risk. \n \nAs with all analogies, however, there are limitations.  Managers of share portfolios, \nbroadly speaking, aim simply to maximise returns for a given level of risk;  there are \nusually no strategic reasons for the particular investments that they choose to make \nbeyond risk-return maximisation2  CRM managers, by contrast, may choose to continue \na relationship with customers who do not create maximum risk-adjusted returns for \nother reasons.  One reason could be regulatory;  there might be legal reasons for \n                                                 \n2 An exception to this general principle is found with ethical investment funds. \n17  \ncontinuing to serve certain customers.  Other reasons could be strategic.  The strategic \nreasons might include volume throughputs that help keep the supplier\u2019s costs down or \nbecause high-profile customers attract others to that supplier or to benefit from shared \ninnovation. \n \nAnother limitation of the application of financial portfolio theory to the management of \ncustomer portfolios is that customers may be interconnected in ways that shares in a \nfinancial portfolio are not.  This discovering and managing interconnectedness might \npay off in major ways for CRM managers;  thus, finding customers of a common type \nwho talk to one another, and then developing or tailoring products or services to this \nparticular group of customers, might pay off for CRM in ways that more than \ncompensate for the increased risk of focusing on one group of customers. \n \nA third limitation of the application of portfolio theory is, of course, that customers can \ntake independent action.  Unlike shares in a financial portfolio, customers can elect to \nleave, or even just to scale down a relationship;  or they can negotiate tougher deals and \nhigher service levels.  These are all considerable risks that customers have but shocks \nand shares do not have.  This paper has indicated how some of these risks can be \nmeasured and managed and urges that such risk management is an essential function of \nCRM. \n \n \nFUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS \n \n18  \nThe measurement of customer risk is an area of concern to practitioners that has been \nrelatively neglected in management literature.  Empirical research to examine the ways \nin which companies actually do evaluate the risk of the customer would add to the \ndomain.  The links between risk measurement and MPT versus Prospect Theory would \nprovide a useful theoretical perspective.  Such work could also provide a fuller \ndefinition of the risk of the customer than that employed by this paper. \n \nResearch is also needed to build a full conceptual model of the risk of the customer, \nrelaxing the assumption in the work discussed above that all risk drivers are equally \nimportant.  Such work could explore dependencies between different risk factors. \n \nMore generally, the application of MPT and of Prospect Theory to the customer \nportfolio could be explored in the context of how CRM managers prioritise marketing \nactivities and make marketing resource allocation decisions. \n \n \nSUMMARY \n \nFrom a CRM perspective, analysing the risk of a customer or segment helps managers \ndevelop strategies not only to maximise the probability that forecast future profits from \nthat customer are secured, but also to minimise the impact that risky customers might \nhave on their company. For example, risk evaluations allow the marketing manager to \nmake pricing decisions based on risk as well as return. This in turn may suggest new \ncustomer relationship management strategies such as retention programmes to reduce \nthe risk of customer purchasing volatility; or customer information gathering to identify \n19  \npotential defectors. Such strategies might even include NOT delivering costly CRM \nprogrammes to groups of customers whose risk\/return profile suggests that doing \nbusiness with them can never create shareholder value for an organisation. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nBrealey, R.
