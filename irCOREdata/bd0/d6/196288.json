We offer an empirical and theoretical exploration of why people in three different \nUK-based medical research projects chose to cooperate.  Data analysis of the accounts of \n128 participants across the three studies was based on the constant comparative method.  \nParticipants\u2019 cooperation was engaged by a perception that they would be contributing to the \n\u2018public good\u2019, but they also wanted to justify their decision as sensible and safe.  Critical to \ntheir cooperation was their belief that researchers would fulfil their side of the cooperative \nbargain, by not exposing participants to risks of harm or exploitation. Although participants \nwere generally unaware of the details of the regulatory regime for research, they \ndemonstrated a generalised reliance on regulation as a feature of everyday life that would \nprovide a safe context for cooperation. In their assessment of particular projects, participants \nmade judgements about whether to cooperate based on more specific cues, which acted as \nsigns to assure them that researchers shared their cooperative intentions. These cues \nincluded organisational and professional credentials, the role identities and perceived \ntrustworthiness of those involved in recruiting to research, and visible signs of reasonable \npractice mandated by regulatory systems.   Thus participants drew on their understandings of \nan institutional field that was much broader than that of research alone. We propose that the \nsocial organisation of research is fundamental to the judgements people make about \ncooperation with research. Cooperation may be a more useful way of thinking about how \npeople come to engage in collaboratively oriented actions such as research participation, \nrather than currently dominant individualistic models. Attention to the institutional context of \nresearch is critical to understanding what makes cooperation possible, and has important \nimplications for the design of regulatory regimes for research. \n \n 3 \n \n \nIntroduction \nQuestions about why people engage in cooperative behaviour have been a long-standing \ninterest of the social sciences (Halfpenny 1999), going back to the work of Durkheim (1984) \non pre-contractual solidarity. A very large body of work in economics and psychology has \nexplored cooperation, much of it using game theory. Sociological studies of cooperation have \nbeen undertaken under various rubrics, including altruism and reciprocity, and have focused \non a diverse range of areas, including the family, charitable giving, blood and organ donation, \nand helping people escape persecution.  In this paper we focus on people\u2019s cooperation with \nmedical research. We define medical research broadly as the scientific study of health and \nillness, though we recognise that the term escapes straightforward and exclusive \nspecification.  We propose that the social organisation of research is fundamental to the \njudgements people make about cooperation with research, and that cooperation may be a \nmore useful way of thinking about how people come to engage in collaboratively oriented \nactions such as research participation, rather than currently dominant (and individualistic) \nmodels such as those concerned with the adequacy of consent.  \nWe begin by making an important distinction between cooperation and decisions about \nparticipation. A burgeoning literature on research participation has aimed to understand \nindividuals\u2019 reasoning, motives, and beliefs, and other factors that influence the decisions they \nmake about participation. This literature has identified the values and characteristics of \nindividual participants (e.g. Fry & Dwyer 2001), people\u2019s perceptions of the benefits of \nparticipation, such as the possibility of securing better treatment and specialist attention \n(Slevin, Mossman, Bowling, et al. 1995; Wendler et al, 2008), risks, costs and benefits of \nparticipation (Lowton 2005) and aspects of information (Ellis, 2000: Jenkins and Fallowfield, \n2000 ) that are relevant to such decisions. But participation is distinct from cooperation. While \nparticipation focuses on an individual\u2019s involvement in a matter or event, cooperation \nnecessarily involves joint action or coordination with other parties. Drawing on a number of \ndifferent approaches, we will, for purposes of this paper, define cooperation as purposeful \npersonal contribution to a common effort. Cooperation, crucially, individuals\u2019 beliefs about the \ncooperative intentions of the other parties involved in the effort (Pruitt & Kimmel, 1977) as well \nindividuals\u2019 own motives for cooperation.  Thus, for example, it is possible that individuals \nmight be keen to join a research project (for example to gain access to new treatments) but \nmight decline an invitation to do so if they are sceptical of the cooperative intentions of the \nresearchers\/research community.   \n 4 \n \nMedical research is an interesting area for scholarly work on cooperation because of two \nfeatures. First, it has many of the characteristics of a public good or a commons, with the \nattendant familiar dilemma that it may impose costs or burdens on those who contribute (such \nas volunteering personal information, contributing biological materials, undergoing additional \ntests or invasive procedures, or making extra visits to clinics), while allowing many to benefit. \nThe research effort therefore depends on engaging the cooperation of those with the potential \nto contribute. But its second characteristic is that it appears, on the face of it, rather an \nunpromising candidate for securing cooperation: it involves risks, including those that derive \nfrom the fact that the interests of researchers may not always be identical to those of research \nparticipants. Commercial organisations or individual researchers\u2019 careers can, for example, \nprofit from the voluntary contributions of participants. A history of scandals has served to \nheighten awareness of risks of mistreatment and exploitation; physical, psychological, and \nemotional harms; and assaults on human rights and dignity (Dixon-Woods and Ashcroft \n2008), demonstrating that the research community cannot always be trusted to have \ncooperative intentions. Taken together, these potential risks and burdens would seem to pose \nchallenges related to fairness and exploitation, which generally undermine people\u2019s tendency \nto cooperate (Fehr & Schmidt, 2001). Given this, why would individuals choose to cooperate \nwith medical research, and what are the conditions necessary for their cooperation? \nThese are important questions, not least because a focus on cooperation affords a \nperspective on how decisions about participation may be socially organised, even when they \nappear to be highly individual. It directs attention in particular to the institutional and \norganisational features that help to structure and shape individuals\u2019 interests, desires, \ndecisions and actions, and the accounts they give of these (Lawrence & Suddaby, 2006; \nPowell and Colyvas, 2008). In particular, it encourages a recognition of how institutional \nforces frame the possibilities for choice and action, where institutions are understood, \nfollowing Ostrom (2005), as the prescriptions that humans use to organise all forms of \nrepetitive and structured interactions, including institutionalised cultural rules as well as formal \norganisations.  \nThis argument is consistent with recent approaches in the sociological literature on charitable \nbehaviour that stress the socially embedded nature of individuals\u2019 philanthropic endeavours \n(Ostrander, 2007), and see recipient organisations\u2019 tactics and practices, efficiency, \nresources, and logistics as helping to shape the behaviour of donors. Similarly, in his analysis \nof blood and organ donation, Kieran Healy (2006) argues that \u2018giving\u2019 is structured, promoted, \nand made logistically possible by the organisations and institutions that have interests in \nsecuring such giving.  Healy recognises that organisations do not simply manipulate their \ndonors; rather, the discourses and resources available to organisations to secure cooperation \nare dependent on social and institutional contexts.  \n 5 \n \nThese kinds of analyses encourage a recognition of both researchers and research \nparticipants as located within an institutional field. For medical research, this includes an \nextensive regulatory apparatus aimed at ensuring safe and ethical conduct of research, and \nthat participants are not exposed to undue risks of harm. In the UK, the Research \nGovernance Framework (RGF) for Health and Social Care (Department of Health 2005), \ngoverns virtually all research conducted within the National Health Service (NHS). It begins by \nrecognising the possible benefits of research, but emphasises the possible risks and the \nconsequent need for governance, and the public\u2019s right to have: \n[\u2026] confidence in, and benefit from, quality research in health and social care. The \npublic has a right to expect high scientific, ethical and financial standards, transparent \ndecision-making processes, clear allocation of responsibilities and robust monitoring \narrangements. (2005: 2) \nThe RGF further emphasises the responsibilities and accountability of researchers. It \ninstitutes a series of external controls over what researchers are permitted to do, including the \nrequirement that all research involving patients be approved by a Research Ethics Committee \nand receive research governance approval from the organisations where the research is to be \nconducted. The regulatory regime for research extends well beyond the RGF, and also \nincludes many other actors, legal instruments, and formal institutions. Taken together, the \nregime directly or indirectly structures what researchers are allowed to do and say about their \nown projects, but seeks also to structure the ways in which people respond to research as an \ninstitution. By constructing an accountability regime and associated rules and structures, \ncooperation is thus invited on grounds that formal governance procedures allow people to be \nconfident that any risks are controlled and managed and their safety can be assured.  \nThe formalisation and codification of this regulatory regime for research might be seen as a \nturn towards a \u2018confidence\u2019 based approach, where confidence is seen as secured through \nuse of formal rules, legalistic procedures, contractual forms, and the availability of monitoring \nand sanctioning procedures, away from a \u2018trust\u2019 based approach, which relies on ethical \nrelations that are not conditioned by an external framework of controls (Tonkiss and Passey, \n1999; Checkland, Marshall, & Harrison 2004; Harrison & Smith 2004; Smith 2001). At a policy \nlevel, it is no longer seen as sufficient to place trust in researchers\u2019 own moral and ethical \nframeworks to ensure that research will be conducted safely and ethically. Rather, formal \nregulatory frameworks such as the RGF explicitly self-identify as being directed towards \ngaining people\u2019s confidence by providing a rational basis for their engagement, and thus \navoiding the lack of accountability and potential for lapses associated with trust-based \napproaches (Dixon-Woods and Ashcroft, 2008). A vocal critique has pointed to the \nimportance of trust in medicine and medical research, and the risk that rule- and contract-\nbased forms of regulation may do violence to trust, with negative consequences (Checkland, \n 6 \n \net al 2004; O'Neill 2004). Despite this, there is surprising little empirically informed \nunderstanding of the basis of people\u2019s cooperation with medical research, and the extent to \nwhich these kinds of regulatory interventions are salient to the grounds on which people make \ntheir decisions to cooperate. Using people's accounts of taking part in three different \nbiomedical research projects, this paper explores people\u2019s accounts of cooperation with \nmedical research, and reflects critically on the role of regulation.   \nMethods \nThis paper is based on analysis of data from qualitative studies of participants\u2019 experiences of \nbeing invited to take part in three different biomedical research projects. These qualitative \nstudies, all approved by an NHS Research Ethics Committee, are briefly (for reasons of \nspace) described here and in Table 1, with references to published papers that provide further \ndetail of the methods. These three studies were chosen because they all provided insights \ninto why people might engage in a research effort, but also allowed for contrast and \ncomparison across different contexts of participation. Two studies (those of tissue banking \nand GRAPHIC) had specifically explored views of regulation of research.  \nThe Childhood Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) tissue banking study was a study \nof parent and child experiences and views of being asked to donate \u2018surplus\u2019 tumour material \nleft over after biopsies or excisions to a national childhood cancer tissue bank for research. It \ninvolved semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 42 families (41 mothers, 18 \nfathers and 20 children), recruited from seven tertiary centres for the treatment of childhood \ncancer across the UK (Dixon-Woods, Cavers, et al., 2008; Dixon-Woods, Wilson, Jackson, \nCavers, & Pritchard-Jones, 2008).  \nThe GRAPHIC participant study was a study of people\u2019s experiences and views of being \nasked to take part in a genetic epidemiology study of blood pressure regulation. GRAPHIC \naimed to develop a phenotyped resource of nuclear families and involved healthy volunteers \nproviding a blood sample for DNA analysis, wearing a blood pressure monitor for 24 hours, \nand responding to a nurse-administered questionnaire. The qualitative study involved semi-\nstructured interviews with a purposive sample of 29 participants from Leicestershire (Dixon-\nWoods, Ashcroft, et al., 2007). \nThe ORACLE participant study was a qualitative study of women\u2019s experiences of being \ninvolved a randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial, which investigated whether specific \nantibiotics were effective in prolonging pregnancy and improving outcomes in women with \nsigns of pre-term labour. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with a purposive sample \nof 20 participants from the Trent region, UK (Kenyon, Dixon-Woods, Jackson, Windridge, & \nPitchforth, 2006).  \n 7 \n \nIn total, 128 interviews contributed to the analysis reported in this paper. \nA systematic and iterative method of analysis based on the constant comparative method \n(Glaser & Strauss 1967) was used. We were concerned with the development, specification \nand integration of categories with theoretical purchase. In order to allow connections to be \nidentified and comparisons to be made systematically between the accounts given by \ndifferent participants in different contexts, the data were first organised into thematic charts. A \nset of themes and subthemes relating to cooperation were identified for each study based on \ncareful reading and comparison of extracts of coded text. The data from each study were then \nsummarised onto a separate chart, representing each participant\u2019s account for each theme \nand sub-theme.  These charts were used to draw up a single, higher-level chart which \nsummarised the findings from each study under the key overarching themes. The summaries \nin the higher-level chart were compared across the studies to generate a coding scheme, \nrefined following discussion with the qualitative researchers who conducted the primary data \ncollection and analysis. The coding scheme was used to assign data to categories using QSR \nN6 software, with categories adjusted and modified to ensure adequate fit with the data as \ncoding proceeded. Quotations used in this paper are anonymised, and labelled with an ID \nnumber with the prefix T to denote that the quotation comes from the tissue banking study, G \nthe GRAPHIC study, and O the ORACLE study.  \nResults \nThe three studies, all \u2018non-commercial\u2019, differed in significant ways. The GRAPHIC study was \nperhaps the most evident example of where those participating made their contribution with \nlittle expectation of a personal gain, as it involved healthy volunteers who were not \nthemselves known to be affected by a disease. The initial recruitment attempt involved no \npersonal contact, as potential participants were sent recruitment material by post and were \nthen later contacted by a study research nurse. The tissue banking study was involved no \npersonal gain for those contributing, though benefits might accrue to a fairly well-defined \npopulation \u2013 those affected by childhood cancer. Consent for the procurement and banking of \ntissue was sought by (usually familiar) staff involved in the care of the child with cancer, either \nbefore or after the surgery where it was removed for therapeutic reasons. The ORACLE trial \nwas in many ways quite distinct. It involved a possible benefit to those who participated, in the \nsense that it was possible that the interventions being studied might have improved outcomes \n\u2013 but there was no certainty of this, and it was also possible that there might be a negative \nimpact. Unlike the other two studies, those who participated were recruited during a health \ncrisis by unfamiliar professional staff. Despite these important differences between the \nstudies, and the different motives people had for participation, one of our most striking \nfindings was that of the similarity of the accounts of cooperation given across the studies. \n 8 \n \nMedical research as a public good \nA vivid feature of the accounts, across all three studies, was their emphasis on the moral \ncharacter of research participation, and in particular the status of medical research as a public \ngood to which responsible people should contribute. To some extent this is evidence of the \nmore general attempt to defend moral character found in most accounts of action. But more \nspecifically, this finding is consistent with Healy\u2019s (2006) argument that people are likely to \ncooperate with a voluntary endeavour only if they can produce a moral account of their \nactions, and is also consistent with the idea that people enjoy the benefit of a \u2018warm glow\u2019 \nwhen they do engage in this kind of cooperative behaviour (Andreoni, 1990). \nWell research is important and it's only by people, well really trial and error that you \nfind out exactly what will work and what won't work and if I can help somebody else in \na couple of years time cos I've been on this trial then all well and good (O4) \nIf they didn\u2019t do this in the past the treatment now wouldn\u2019t be there really would it? \nAs soon as you hear the research for future [\u2026] that was all I needed to know, the \nfact that it would be used for future to help other people (T2) \nRisks and safety \nClearly, accepting an invitation to serve the public good allowed participants to display their \nmoral character and gain intrinsic pay-offs. But, importantly, there was a recognition that it \nwould not be seen as morally deviant to decline the invitation either. This was because \nparticipants\u2019 eagerness to serve the public good was tempered by some wariness. Many \n(though not all) explicitly recognised medical research was not always for a \u2018good cause\u2019, \nsafe, or ethical, and they used examples such as \u2018scandals\u2019 or evidence of poor practice to \ndemonstrate this.  \nI know medical research is sometimes open to argument, it's important, I mean the \nMMR scare is the one that really brings home to you how research in inverted \ncommas can be used inappropriately or, you know, can be quite difficult to make sure \nit's to everybody's benefit (G7)  \nI was a bit apprehensive because I thought, you know, sometimes you hear stories of \nmedical research like how things go wrong (O14)  \nIn Healy\u2019s (2006) analysis of blood and organ donation, he argues that an excess of altruism \nis not seen as culturally plausible \u2013 for example, an individual who wishes to give away a \nkidney to help an unidentified other would be regarded with suspicion. Similarly, our data \nsuggested that people felt they could not reasonably be expected to accept undue risks in the \n 9 \n \ninterests of others, and their accounts thus demonstrated that the option of declining an \ninvitation to participate in research was culturally available.  Indeed, it seemed that it was \noften important for women in the ORACLE study, who were making decisions on behalf of \ntheir unborn child, to construct accounts that explicitly defended their decision. These women \nwere keen to show that they had reflected on potential risks before cooperating. In accounts \nthat displayed rationalisations and trade-offs of perceived risks and benefits, they explained \nhow the possible benefit to their babies from the treatment being tested in the trial had \nprovided a good reason for accepting a small amount of risk.  \nThe risk to [baby] you know, because he was dependent, everything was like on me \nand I wanted to make the right decision for him [\u2026] I wouldn't want to put an unborn \nbaby at risk if there was any risk (O13) \nAll right it might keep it [baby] in, but would it cause brain damage or its lungs not \ngrow properly and stuff? But then I think the fact that your baby, if it's born that early, \ncould have so many other things wrong with it anyway sort of overrides that. It's just \nlike well if that may help then yeah. (O16) \nParticipants in the tissue banking study were similarly concerned that their child should not be \nexposed to unnecessary risk, but the types of risks they identified differed markedly from \nthose perceived by the ORACLE participants. Parents perceived that there was little risk of \nphysical harm associated with obtaining tissue for research, as the surgery where it was \nremoved would be undertaken for therapeutic reasons anyway. They did, however, identify \nrisks of exploitation, including the possibility that surgeons might take extra tissue for \nresearch, or that the tissue might not be put to good or appropriate use. These might be \ncharacterised as concerns about becoming \u2018a mark\u2019 (Goffman 1952) \u2013 someone who is the \nvictim of a scam. \nI would prefer it if it was just basically medically you know for a cure or looking into \nwhy these things happen and there\u2019s ways of preventing them and everything, rather \nthan something like cosmetics or things along those lines, which I\u2019m sure it possibly \nwon\u2019t be used for that. (T64) \nI would hope that it\u2019s kept by the correct people [\u2026] I wouldn\u2019t like to see it used by \nanyone else to be honest anyone that\u2019s in that kind of [making] money out of \nsomething like that (T30) \nIn the GRAPHIC study, participants often identified possible benefits (such as \u201cwarm glow\u201d \nand getting the results of health checks) and had difficulty identifying potential risks, and any \nrisks identified were felt to be minimal and very unlikely.  These accounts again defended the \n 10 \n \ndecision to take part as reasonable, demonstrating people\u2019s expectations that they would not \ncome to any harm through their participation. \n \nCAN YOU SEE ANY RISK TO YOU IN PARTICIPATING? \nNo, well clinical risks of an infected needle of something like that, so minimal as to be \nignored, no risks, not at all \nANYTHING ELSE AT ALL? \nNo (G5) \n \nIt is clear that cooperation with any particular research project was conditional on participants \nbeing able to construct moral accounts of their decisions that allowed them to show that they \nwere contributing to the common good, and hence to gain intrinsic pay-offs from their decision \nto cooperate.  But it was also important that they could feel confident that their decision had \nnot been taken irresponsibly or stupidly \u2013 that they expected those conducting the research to \nreciprocate by acting cooperatively in return, by not exposing them to physical harm or \nexploiting their tissue or personal data. This raises the question of the grounds on which \nthese beliefs and expectations underpinning decisions to cooperate were based. \nRegulation  \nIn none of the three studies did regulation appear spontaneously in any account of why \nparticipants chose to cooperate. In two studies (GRAPHIC and tissue banking), participants \nwere specifically asked about the regulation of research. When prompted, participants \ndescribed regulation as a form of background reassurance; they assumed that research was \nregulated, but were unsure of the details of how. Most participants were unfamiliar with \nResearch Ethics Committees (RECs), but were not surprised to learn that they existed, and \nwere able to describe what they thought their role in governing research might be: to police \nthe (legal and ethical) boundaries for research. They sometimes explicitly referred to previous \nscandals involving research as part of the rationale for having such oversight. \nPerhaps as a result of mistakes that have been made before, yes, I think people are \nobviously looking at it and thinking, 'well, you know, we can't make those sort of \nmistakes again.' [\u2026] there's so many preliminary checks made now (G8) \nThere is some experimental evidence to suggest that having sanctioning systems may \ndamage trust by encouraging the view that those to whom the sanctions apply act in their own \ninterests and lack the internal motivation to do good (Mulder et al 2006). The very existence \nof policies, frameworks, and procedures might be interpreted as signals of danger. But our \ndata are more consistent with Sztompka\u2019s (2007) argument that governance can have a \nprotective role in providing an environment in which cooperation can flourish: it allows those \n 11 \n \nwith cooperative intentions and motivations to cooperate safely, building cooperative norms \nwithin the community, in the knowledge that defectors (those who harm or exploit others) will \nbe subject to punishment.  \nI'm assuming that there's certain things they can do and certain things they can't do \nbut purely that every other aspect of life is fairly tightly controlled by the government \nand by the law so you assume that areas like this would be controlled as well (G24)  \nObviously there must, everything must be monitored, you know, this is the way, this is \nwhat we do, these are the paths we go down (T13) \nParticipants\u2019 accounts demonstrated little familiarity with the specifics of regulation for medical \nresearch, but rather a more generalised reliance on regulation as a feature of everyday life.  \nIn their assessment of particular projects, participants made judgements about whether to \ncooperate based on more specific cues, including: organisational and professional \ncredentials; interpersonal trust; and visible signs of reasonable practice.  \nOrganisational and professional credentials \nGambetta and Hamill (2005) report that people seek cues and other signs as signals of the \nproperties that are relevant to trustworthiness. Similarly, participants across the three \ndatasets described relying on various cues in coming to their judgements about the values \nand trustworthiness of the research they were asked to take part in. They reported using \norganisational and professional credentials as the basis of their confidence that the research \nwould work in accordance with the Mertonian ideals of science (Merton 1973). This meant \nthey held \u2018reasonable expectations\u2019 (Parker 2005) that the research would be legitimate, \nwould produce benefits for society, and be safe and ethical. Such credentials gave people \ngrounds to assume that the cooperative intentions of the researchers were sound. Thus, even \nthough the tissue banking study was conducted not long after a major public UK scandal \ninvolving retention of children\u2019s organs and bodily materials following post-mortems (Redfern, \n2001), parents who were interviewed were nonetheless confident that any samples \ncontributed by their children would be handled appropriately: \nYou talk about the ethical use of samples, but to a certain degree I think in that \nsituation you\u2019d automatically assume that [\u2026] I\u2019d trust that they, you know it would be \ndone ethically (T20) \nParticipants\u2019 accounts frequently identified research as involving collectivities or coalitions of \nindividuals, organisations and institutions that they perceived to have a high degree of what \nSitkin and Roth (1993) term \u2018value congruity\u2019. Expectations of moral conduct by other \n 12 \n \nmembers of the collectivity were fundamental to their decisions of participants to cooperate by \nmaking their own investment in the coalition. \nYou just assume as a member of the public anything that goes on in hospitals is all \nabove board and is within reason obviously [\u2026.] they're NHS laboratories, \nuniversities or hospitals with people who work for the NHS or whatever and that\u2019s it. \nOr if it was a private company again it was to if this was farmed out to private \ncompanies it was for the great good to find a cure for cancer. [\u2026] Nobody\u2019s trying to \ndo anything underhanded here, this is above-board, we\u2019re trying to cure cancer. (T21) \nI think we all simply assumed that it was going to be carried out in a proper fashion \nand so it was. [\u2026] I suppose the fundamental belief that the vast majority of people \nwho are involved in medicine and its allied professions, I mean research, are \ndedicated professionals. [\u2026] People who go into that walk of life are doing it because \nthey want to do it and they're just dedicated. (G17) \nThese data tell us something about the values to which participants subscribe. They also \nindicate that participants expect values of cooperation and commitment to disinterested \nmedical progress to be shared throughout the social world (Dixon-Woods, Wilson, et al. \n2008a) of medical research. These expectations to a large extent are expectations of \nreciprocity: that if individual participants act from goodwill and contribute to research, research \nwill be conducted in the spirit of goodwill and contribute to the public good. Importantly, these \nassumptions were not specific to, nor derived solely from, a view of the institution of research: \nrather, in large part, they were \u2018borrowed\u2019 from broad expectations of other institutions: the \nhealth service, the organisation where the research was being conducted, and the \nprofessionals involved in recruitment. These accounts thus demonstrate the relevance of the \ninstitutional context in which people choose to co-operate, but also suggest that the (formal) \ninstitutional context that is salient for participants is not that specifically of research, but rather \nis primarily that of medicine and healthcare. Reassurances that came from those bearing the \nappropriate credentials were particularly valued:  \nYou have to put your trust in their hands don\u2019t you? And you just feel, you're just \nguided by really the consultants, you're guided by the nurses and the doctors [\u2026]  \nthey were in the medical profession. (T13)  \nI mean you know that the people that\u2019re taking it they are professional people who are \nstriving to find cures and better treatments you know so I mean whatever they decide \nthey need to use it for to the greater good of others it can\u2019t be wrong can it? (T66) \nI asked about it, yeah, and they, and nurse assured me (O19) \n 13 \n \nThese findings point to how people respond to social life on the basis of categories. Members \nof the health professions, and institutions such as the NHS, were taken to have good motives \nand to act in the public interest because, as Potter and Wetherell (1987:116) put it, they were \n\u2018taken to be members of relatively enduring categories, and in virtue of their category \nmembership inferences are made from the attributes of individuals to the attributes of the rest \nof the category\u2019. \n Interpersonal trust \nAs Lowton\u2019s (2005) has also reported, a distinct but related element of participants\u2019 \nassessment of whether cooperation was warranted relied on interpersonal trust. Interpersonal \ntrust, as described by participants, was created through \u2018facework\u2019 (Giddens 1990), where \nencounters between recruiters and those being asked to take part had characteristics of \ntrustworthiness, including qualities of friendship, respect, and politeness. Participants held the \nbelief that professionals had their best interests at heart, because these were the people \nhelping them or their child, and hence strongly believed that they would not expose them or \ntheir child to unnecessary risk. The safety associated with the institution of the health \nprofessions thus helped to augment perceptions of the safety of research. In the tissue \nbanking study, participants described relying on trust built through relationships with particular \nindividuals to manage or bracket the risks and uncertainties involved in taking part in \nresearch.  Parents relied on the trust they had already invested in the professionals caring for \ntheir child, often during repeated and intimate interactions, to provide assurances that their \nchild would not be exposed to unnecessary harm. \nBecause he knows so much about your child and the condition and everything I think \nit makes you feel a bit more comfortable \u2018cos he\u2019d only do what he thought was best \nfor your child. (T1) \n[I did] not think for one minute the surgeon that we had would be motivated by any \nother [than] altruistic means and or motives (T7) \nParticipants in the ORACLE trial also referred to the fiduciary nature of their relationship with \nthe doctors, midwives, and nurses, but in this situation they had to rely on \u2018swift trust\u2019 \n(Meyerson, Weick, & Kramer 1996) rather than trust built up over repeated interactions.  \nI was confident with the doctors who suggested it and went with them really (O11) \n\u2018Swift trust\u2019 can be formed quickly in temporary groups or encounters to enable people to \ncooperate under conditions of vulnerability, uncertainty and risk. It relies heavily on \nperceptions of others\u2019 role categories, and the enactment of \u2018technically competent role \nperformance\u2019 (Barber 1983: 9) which engenders positive expectations, as well as behaviour \n 14 \n \nthat signals the other party\u2019s trustworthiness (Dibben, Morris, & Lean 2000), as also indicated \nby the GRAPHIC participants. It was thus evident across all three studies that interpersonal \ntrust, in this sense, was institutionally located: though participants responded to individuals\u2019 \npersonal qualities, they saw also professionals as bearers of warrants.  \nVisible signs of reasonable practice \nOur data across the three studies suggested that the provision of information, and the \nenactment of the \u2018informed consent\u2019 process, were important not so much as means for \nparticipants to gain information to inform their decision-making process, but rather as cues \nthat the cooperative bargain would be fulfilled. \nI didn't really need to know all the ins and outs of it all [\u2026] you don't need all the \ndetails of what they are going to do if you agree to do it and you know they're ok (G3) \nThese routines functioned as visible signs of reasonable practice, but also signals of \nopenness, trustworthiness, honesty and good intentions on the part of the researchers to act \nwithin a cooperative model.  \nI suppose part of the process that NHS, [hospital] was there, [University] and it was \nyou know, three well known, well respected organisations so the amount of \ninformation I received was sufficient for me to make a decision. If it had been from \nJoe Bloggs, you know, bio whatever, I wouldn't have even responded. It would've \ngone in the bin [\u2026] it gives it credence; it gives it the stamp of approval really (G6) \nI think the nurse explained it to me really well. I was really pleased with the way she'd \nexplained it to me. I mean she weren't sort of putting on any pressure or, she'd \nexplained it in a way that I could only see, you know, I could see more benefits than \nanything else to it, so. (O5) \nDocumentary evidence of \u2018warrants of trust\u2019 was especially important to participants in the \nGRAPHIC study.  Logos and assurances of affiliation with hospitals and universities in the \nrecruitment paperwork were described as critical cues by people in distinguishing between \nresearch carried out by NHS organisations, and other organisations - such as pharmaceutical \ncompanies - in which they had less trust.   \nit was like this, you know, the NHS on the top, official paper shall we say, it was \nofficial paper [\u2026] I wouldn't have done it for just, I wouldn't of had needles, somebody \nput needles into me if they weren't, National Health Service (G26) \n 15 \n \nDiscussion \nOur analysis of three different studies of accounts of being asked to take part in medical \nresearch demonstrates the extent to which individual decisions may be socially organised. \nWe propose that medical research can be understood as an example of what Mancur Olson \n(1971) terms collective action, one where collaboration and cooperation are required between \na range of parties. Those who cooperate with medical research want to show that they have \ncontributed to the public good and demonstrated kinship and fellow-feeling, but they also want \nto demonstrate that they were not stupid, gullible, and foolhardy in so doing. Attention to the \ninstitutional context of research, and the social relations between participants and \nresearchers, is thus critical to understanding what enables cooperative behaviour by research \nparticipants. Our analysis suggests that, notwithstanding any benefits that may occur to \nindividuals, participation in medical research is characteristically understood by unpaid \nresearch participants as a contribution to a public good. It has identified what participants feel \nis the researcher\u2019s side of the cooperative bargain, and what signs they rely upon for \nreassurance that researchers share the same cooperative intentions. People recognise that \nresearch may be potentially risky, and sought assurances of safety. Safety in this context \nranged from protection from direct physical harms through to affirmation that participants were \nnot being \u2018taken for a ride\u2019 (duped, suckered, or conned) by cooperating with researchers. \nDecisions about cooperation were not thoughtless, irrational, or undiscriminating. But people \nalso did not make decisions in ways that would be seen as \u2018fully reasoned\u2019. Their decisions \nwere set against a context of beliefs about shared social norms, visible evidence of \ntrustworthiness, the assumed existence of a regulatory system and symbolic evidence of \nregulatory and institutional safeguards, giving participants what they saw as good reasons to \nbelieve the risks are low. \nWe drew on data on participants\u2019 views of being asked to participate in three very different \nmedical research studies, and this allowed us to identify some common aspects of people\u2019s \naccounts of their decisions. A limitation is that our data only involved people who did consent \nto participate in medical research, not those who declined participation or dropped out of the \nprimary studies. It also did it not involve those asked to take in \u2018commercial\u2019 studies. Those \nwho did not consent may have very different views, including a very different orientation \ntowards cooperation.  Nonetheless, our data provided clear evidence that people\u2019s reasoning \nand engagement were actively structured by the institutional field in which research projects \nwere located.  \nOur data suggest that decisions about cooperating with research often functioned at the level \nof heuristic. There was evidence of a strong tendency to make category-based inferences to \ninform assumptions about the motives and interests of those conducting and recruiting to \nresearch, and to assume value congruity. Using category-level inferences about the \n 16 \n \ntrustworthiness of the institutions and organisations involved in research reduced the \ncognitive and emotional demand of the decision, enabling people to make decisions that they \nfelt were consistent with their values and preferences without having to consider all \ninformation. Regulation was important as a form of background reassurance, but the specific \ndetails of the regulatory code appeared to be of little salience. Participants recognised that \nthey could not police the research themselves; they instead argued that it was reasonable for \nthem to assume that there would be a set of formal arrangements for the governance of \nresearch, and that other parties were managing the risks sufficiently well that they had no \nneed to worry. Such an analysis is consistent with Starr\u2019s (1985) argument that people\u2019s \nacceptance of risk that is not directly under their control depends on their assumptions about \nthe existence and reliability of risk management, and that violations will be sanctioned (Fehr & \nFischbacher 2004). This meant that the detail or content of various communications was \nrelatively unimportant to participants; what was important was their symbolic value: that the \nproper rituals were enacted, and the available cues were the right ones. In making \njudgements about the goodness and safety of particular studies, participants engaged in \nmonitoring of visible signs of \u2018reasonable practice\u2019 (Power 1999) of the kind that might be \nmandated by a regulatory regime, and responded to aspects of the \u2018front stage\u2019 of research \nprojects. An important consequence of this, from a regulatory perspective, is that the \nincreasing standardisation and routinisation of recruitment procedures required by regulatory \nprocesses (Dixon-Woods et al, 2007) may inadvertently reduce the level of monitoring that \npeople engage in by providing cues on which people uncritically rely. \nImportantly, the role identities of particular professionals and institutionally located \ninterpersonal relations helped to confer legitimacy and secure people\u2019s cooperation. The \nnotion of researchers and health professionals as trusted agents, and beliefs about \nprofessional morals and ethics, were highly relevant to participants despite a regulatory turn \naway from relying on trust and professional agency as means of managing risk. Doctors, \nnurses, and other health professionals acted as intermediaries in the sense described by \nColeman (1994) where they acted as guarantors of the propriety of the research project to \nwhich they were recruiting. The field of research thus in some senses \u2018grazes the commons\u2019 \n(Offer, 1996) or trades on the field of healthcare (specifically the institutional frame of the \nNHS) and the healthcare professions, and their associated credibility and credentials.  \nOur analysis therefore suggests that the social organisation of research is fundamental to the \njudgements people make about cooperation. It further suggests that cooperation may be a \nmore useful way of thinking about how people come to engage in collaboratively oriented \nactions such as research participation, rather than currently dominant (and individualistic) \nmodels such as those concerned with the adequacy of consent. Our findings also challenge \ninfluential literature which has advanced a theoretical distinction between trust and \nconfidence, and led to a polarised view of regulatory approaches as either trust- or \n 17 \n \nconfidence-based (e.g. Checkland et al, 2004). The distinction between trust and confidence \nwas difficult to discern empirically in our data. People appeared to orient towards research \nbased on positive expectations about what occurs within a community with commonly shared \nnorms and a high degree of value congruence, as well as relying on fiduciary aspects of their \nrelationships with health professionals, thus conforming to a trust-based model. But they also \nrelied on assumptions about constraint and oversight that were much more consistent with a \nconfidence-based model. Thinking about cooperation rather than trust or confidence helps to \ndirect our attention to how judgements and actions that might at first glance appear individual \n(such as consent), are in fact institutionally and organisationally structured. \nConclusions \nSecuring cooperation with medical research requires that participants are able to produce an \naccount of their actions that demonstrates first, their moral qualities, and second, that they \nhave not been reckless as to their own safety and integrity. Our evidence across three \ndifferent studies confirms that the social organisation of medical research is critical to these \naccounts. Our analysis sees people as agentic, but identifies how their reasoning, judgements \nand actions in relation to cooperation are institutionally structured. But the relevant \ninstitutional field is not a single, well-defined one solely comprising research activities, and \nindeed the regulatory regime for research is salient only in so far as regulation is assumed to \nbe a feature of everyday life. As conceived by participants, the salient institutional field is a \nbroader field including healthcare and the health professions, governed by cooperative norms \nand oriented towards serving the public good. It is on the basis of this wider field, and its \nresources of credibility, credentials, reputational capital, and background assumptions about \noversight and control, that people cooperate. Regulatory effort might usefully focus on how to \nensure that people\u2019s expectations about the cooperative norms in operation in the field of \nresearch can best be upheld rather than, perhaps, the routinisation of visible signs of \nreasonable practice at the recruitment stage.  \n \n 18 \n \n \n Potential participants Recruitment Semi-structured \ninterviews by social \nscientist \nCCLG tissue \nbanking \nstudy \nFamilies from seven UK \nchildhood cancer treatment \ncentres: \n\uf0b7 With a child diagnosed with \ncancer >6 months previously \n\uf0b7 Not experiencing health \ncrisis \n\uf0b7 Mix of social and ethnic \nbackground, different tumour \ntypes, age of child \nFamilies approached by \nhospital staff  \n42 families (41 mothers, 18 \nfathers, 20 children) consented \nExploring views on consenting \nto tissue donation (2004-5) \nGRAPHIC \nparticipant \nstudy \nGRAPHIC study participants \nwho had agreed to be \ncontacted about further studies \n(\u201chealthy\u201d volunteers \nregistered with GPs in \nLeicestershire, UK): \n\uf0b7 Mix of position in the family \n(parent\/offspring), gender, \nwillingness to be involved in \nresearch \nGRAPHIC participants invited \nto qualitative study by \nGRAPHIC principal \ninvestigator \n29 individuals (16 men, 13 \nwomen) consented \nExploring participants\u2019 \nexperiences and views of \nbeing recruited to the \nGRAPHIC study (2005) \nORACLE \nparticipant \nstudy \nORACLE participants (women \nin the Trent region who \nrequested trial results): \n\uf0b7 Socially diverse (non-\npurposive sampling) \nORACLE participants invited \nto qualitative study by \nORACLE Principal Investigator \n20 women consented \nExploring perceptions of the \nresults of the trial and \nwomen\u2019s experiences of being \nrecruited to and participating in \nthe ORACLE trial (2004) \n \n \nReferences \n \nAndreoni, J.
