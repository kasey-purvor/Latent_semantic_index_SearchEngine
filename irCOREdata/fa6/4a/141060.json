INTRODUCTION  \n \nAcoustic emissions (AE) are defined as transient elastic waves generated from a rapid \nrelease of strain energy caused by a deformation or damage within or on the surface \nof a material [1,2,3]. In this particular investigation, AE\u2019s are defined as the transient \nelastic waves generated by the interaction of two surfaces in relative motion. The \ninteraction of surface asperities and impingement of the bearing rollers over the \nseeded defect on the outer and inner races will result in the generation of acoustic \nemission.  \n \n2. ACOUSTIC EMISSION AND BEARING DEFECT DIAGNOSIS \n \nThe formation of subsurface cracks due to the Hertzian contact stress induced by the \nrolling action of the bearing elements in contact with the inner and outer races, and, \nthe rubbing between damaged mating surfaces within the bearing will generate \nacoustic emission activity.  Catlin [4] reported AE activity from bearing defects were \nattributed to four main factors including numerous transient and random AE signals \nassociated with bearing defects. Furthermore, it was stated that the signals detected in \nthe AE frequency range represented bearing defects rather than other defects such as \nimbalance, misalignment, looseness, shaft bending as well as the other major \nstructural component resonance\u2019s. In addition, Catlin noted that high frequency AE \nsignatures attenuate rapidly; therefore, if the transducer was placed close to the \nbearing, it was possible to detect the high frequency content induced mainly by the \nbearing fault since signatures originating from other machine components are highly \nattenuated upon reaching the sensor. Roger [5] utilised the AE technique for \n 3\nmonitoring slow rotating anti-friction slew bearings on cranes employed for gas \nproduction and obtained some encouraging results compared to vibration monitoring \ntechniques. Rubbing of the crack faces, grinding of the metal fragments in the bearing \nand impacts between the rolling elements and the damaged parts in the loaded zone \nwere identified as sources of detectable AE signatures.  \n \nYoshioka and Fujiwara [6,7] have shown that the AE parameters identified bearing \ndefects before they appeared in the vibration acceleration range. In addition, sources \nof AE generation were identified during fatigue life tests on thrust loaded ball \nbearings. Hawman et al [8] reinforced Yoshioka\u2019s observation that AE provided \nearlier detection of bearing faults than vibration analysis and noted that diagnosis of \ndefect bearings was accomplished due to modulation of high frequency AE bursts at \nthe outer race defect frequency. Hawman placed the AE receiving sensor directly onto \nthe bearing outer race. The modulation of AE signatures at bearing defect frequencies \nhas also been observed by other researchers [9,10]. In addition, Bagnoli et al [11] \ninvestigated demodulation of AE signatures at the defect rotational frequency (outer \nrace) of a bearing. It was noted that when the defect was absent, the periodicity of the \npassage of the balls beneath the load could be readily identified by observing the \nfrequency spectrum of demodulated AE signatures, however, it was reported that the \nAE intensity was less without the defect present. There was no mention of trigger \nlevels employed, load applied on the test bearing, method of attaching the transducers \nto the rig nor any information on background noise.  \n \nThe most commonly measured AE parameters for diagnosis are amplitude, r.m.s, \nenergy, counts and events [3]. Counts involve determining the number of times the \n 4\namplitude exceeds a preset voltage (threshold level) in a given time and gives a \nsimple number characteristic of the signal. An AE event consists of a group of counts \nand signifies a transient wave. \n \nTandon & Nakra [12] investigated AE counts and peak amplitudes for an outer race \ndefect using a resonant type transducer. It was concluded that AE counts increased \nwith increasing load and rotational speed. However, it was observed that AE counts \ncould only be used for defect detection when the defect was less than 250\u00b5m in \ndiameter, though AE peak amplitude provided an indication of defects irrespective of \nthe defect size. Loads applied ranged from 8 to 50% of the bearing static load rating. \nChoudhary et al [13] employed AE for bearing defect identification on various sized \nbearings and rotational speeds ranging from 500 to 1500rpm. It was observed that AE \ncounts were low for undamaged bearings, based on a threshold level of 1-volt. In \naddition, it was observed that AE counts increased with increasing speed for damaged \nand undamaged bearings whilst an increase in load did not result in any significant \nchanges in AE counts for both damaged and undamaged bearings. \n \nVibha Bansal et al [14] applied AE as a quality control tool on reconditioned \nbearings. Bearings were tested at 3% of the load rating. It was noted that as the load \nincreased there was little increase in the peak-to-peak amplitude level for standard \n(operational) and reconditioned bearings, however, the peak values of the \nreconditioned bearing was in some instances five-times that of a new bearing.  \n \nTan [15] used a variation of the standard AE count parameter for diagnosis of \ndifferent sized ball bearings. In addition to the difficulty of selecting the most \n 5\nappropriate threshold level for standard AE counts, Tan sited a couple of other \ndrawbacks with the conventional AE count technique. This included dependence of \nthe count value on the signal frequency. Secondly, it was commented that the count \nrate was indirectly dependent upon the amplitude of the AE pulses. Tan\u2019s variation to \nthe standard AE counts technique involved computing the accumulated area under the \namplitude-time curve of the AE waveform over a specified time period. This was \naccomplished by setting four trigger levels with amplitude multiples of 1, 2, 4 and 8, \nand calculating the area under the amplitude-time AE waveform. The final count \nassigned was weighted by the multiple of the amplitude ratio between these levels. It \nwas concluded that the \u2018new\u2019 count rates increased exponentially with increasing \ndefect sizes and increasing rotational speed. The dependence of AE counts on \nthreshold levels was also noted by Huguet et al [16] during investigations on the use \nof AE for identifying damage modes in specific materials, in this instance, a trigger \nlevel of 10% of the maximum amplitude was employed. \n \nThe acoustic emission technique has also been employed by Miettinen et al [17] to \nmonitor the lubricant condition in rolling element bearing. And successful \napplications of AE to bearing diagnosis for extremely slow rotational speeds have \nbeen reported [18, 19]. \n \nIt must be noted that the propagation of the acoustic emission is affected by material \nmicrostructure, inhomogeneties, geometrical arrangement of free surfaces, loading \nconditions and number of component interfaces. Almost all research on the \napplication of AE to bearing defect analysis have been undertaken on experimental \ntest-rigs specifically designed to reduce AE background noise. In addition, a clear \n 6\nrelationship between r.m.s, amplitude and energy with rotational speed and radial load \nhas been reported, particularly on outer race defects. The successful use of AE counts \nfor bearing diagnosis is dependent on the particular investigation, and, the method of \ndetermining the trigger level is at the discretion of the investigator. Moreover, it has \nbeen shown that AE counts are sensitive to the level and grade of lubricant within the \nbearing, adding to the complexity of this measure. For these reasons, the investigation \npresented in this paper intends to validate the use of r.m.s, amplitude, energy and AE \ncounts for diagnosis and to determine a method for selecting the most appropriate \nthreshold level for AE counts. \n \n \n3. EXPERIMENTAL EQUIPMENT \n \nA test rig was designed to simulate early stage of bearing defects, see figure 1. \nThe rig consisted of a motor\/gear box unit that providing a rotational speed range \nof between 10 to 4000 rpm. Two aligning support bearings, a rubber coupling and \na larger support bearing, type FAFNIRDRN-A9598 (internal bore diameter of \n50mm) was employed.  \n 7\n \nFigure 1 Bearing test-rig; Insert shows close-up of test bearing  \n \nThe test bearing investigated was a split Cooper spherical roller, type 01C\/40GR. \nThis type of bearing was chosen owing to its ability to be disassembled without \nremoving slave bearings, thereby allowing the test bearing to be regularly \ninspected throughout the test programme. Furthermore, it allowed assembly of the \ndefective components with minimal disruption to the test-rig. A radial load was \napplied to the top of the bearing via a hydraulic cylinder ram supported by an \u2018H\u2019 \nframe. All attempts were undertaken to ensure the amount of grease within the \nbearing remained the same. It must be noted that for all tests and simulations, the \nreceiving transducer was cemented onto the test bearing housing, see figure 2.  \n \n \n \n \n 8\nCharacteristics of the test bearing (Split Cooper, type 01C\/40GR) were: \n\u0083  Internal (bore) diameter, 40mm \n\u0083 External diameter, 84mm \n\u0083 Diameter of roller, 11.9mm \n\u0083 Number of rollers, 10 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2  Position of AE receiving sensor on test bearing \n \n4. DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM \n \nA piezoelectric type sensor (Physical Acoustic Corporation type WD) with an \noperating frequency range of 100 kHz \u2013 1000 kHz was employed. A schematic \ndiagram of the acquisition system is illustrated in figure 3. \n \n \n \n 9\n \nFigure 3 Schematic diagram of acquisition system \n \nPre-amplification ranged from 40 to 60dB (PAC type 1220A, bandwidth between 20 \nkHz and 1.2 MHz). The signal output from the pre-amplifier was connected (i.e. via \nBNC\/coaxial cable) directly to a commercial data acquisition card within a Pentium \nhost PC. This AEDSP acquisition card provided up to 8 MHz sampling rate and \nincorporated 16-bit precision giving a dynamic range of more than 85 dB. Prior to the \nanalog-to-digital converter (ADC) anti-aliasing filters were employed.  A total of \n33,000 data points were recorded per acquisition (data file) at a sampling rate of \n4MHz. One hundred (100) data files were recorded for each simulated case, providing \nover 0.8 seconds of data per fault simulation. This was equivalent to 8-revolutions of \ndata at 600rpm; 20-revolutions at 1500 rpm and 40-revolutions at 3000rpm. A trigger \nlevel of 31mV was employed, this was not set above background noise conditions so \nthat realistic diagnostic conditions were replicated, in effect this trigger level was \nequivalent to a \u2019free run\u2019 of the acquisition system. The procedure for recording data \nsimply involved arming the acquisition system at random intervals over a 15-minute \nperiod for each simulation. It was thought this would provide a good test on the \nrobustness of specific AE characteristic parameters to diagnosis of operational \nbearings. \n \nPre-amplifier,  \n40 dB or 60 dB gain \nPost-amplifier and \npower source for \npre-amplifier  \nCOMPUTER \nPost processing Analogue-to-digital converter (ADC)  \nAcoustic emission sensor,  \n100 kHz to 1 MHz  \n 10\n \n5. SIGNAL PROCESSING \n \nThe AE parameters measured for diagnosis in this particular investigation were \namplitude, r.m.s, energy and AE counts. The energy was computed with the \ntrapezoidal numerical integration. AE counts at varying percentages of a defined \namplitude were calculated. \n \n6. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE \n \n6.1 Attenuation test by breaking leads \n \nPrior to defect simulations, attenuation tests were undertaken on the test-rig to \ndetermine its characteristics. This involved pressing lead, 0.5mm 2H, obliquely \nagainst the surface at predetermined positions on the bearing. Four positions were \nidentified; the inner and outer races, the rolling elements and the bearing casing \nadjacent to the receiving transducer, see figure 4. This test is widely known as the \nNielson source test. Due to the simplicity and repeatability in generating AE signals it \nwas used for evaluating attenuation characteristics across the bearing.  \n 11\n \nFigure 4 Determining attenuation characteristics across the bearing \n \nFive readings at each position were recorded and averaged, see appendix A. During \nattenuation tests all attempts were undertaken to ensure direct contact between the \ninner race, roller, outer race and the bearing casing. This was accomplished by \npositioning a roller at top-dead-center in direct path with the load. The reference used \nfor attenuation calculations was the AE input adjacent to the sensor on the bearing \ncasing (Pref) and the relative attenuation was computed by: \n \ndB = 20*log(Pi\/ Pref)i =AE input on bearing elements   (1) \n \nThe relative attenuation of AE signatures generated on the inner race was \napproximately 12dB and 3dB, in terms of r.m.s and maximum amplitude respectively. \nRates of approximately 30dB and 16dB were observed with AE signatures generated \non the roller, whilst attenuation rates of 4dB and 0dB were also noted for AE inputs  \non the outer race, see figure 5. \nInner race \nRollers \nPart of the \nouter race\n 12\n-32.00\n-24.00\n-16.00\n-8.00\n0.00\nOR Roller\nBearing element\nA\ntt\nen\nua\ntio\nn \n(d\nB)\nMax\nr.m.s\n \n Figure 5 Relative attenuation of bearing elements at 0KN \n \nIt was noted that increasing the load during attenuation tests resulted in a decrease in \nmaximum amplitude and r.m.s values of AE signatures from the inner race, see figure \n6. This was attributed to the position of the roller at top-dead-center and the \nunrestricted rotational movement of the bearing during attenuation tests. As such, \nwhen a load was applied at top-dead-center, the roller directly in the path of the load \nwill be displaced from its initial position, thereby altering the direct transmission path. \nDue to the assembly and arrangement of the test bearing during these tests, see figure \n4, the AE source input on the roller was at bottom-dead-center where the section of \nbearing was unloaded. A clearance between the roller and the races will exist at this \nposition and explains the marked difference in attenuation of the roller in comparison \nto the inner and outer races. If however, it was possible to seed an AE source on the \nroller at top-dead-center within the loaded zone, it would be expected that the \nattenuation rate would be between that of the inner and outer races, as long as the \nroller remained at this position irrespective of the loading. In contrast, loading had no \neffect on the attenuation characteristics of the outer race. \nIR\nOR \u2013 Outer race \n IR  \u2013 Inner race \n 13\n0.00\n2.50\n5.00\n7.50\n10.00\n0 3.5 7\nLoad (KN)\nM\nax\nim\num\n (V\nol\nts\n)\nMax (Outer race)\nMax (Inner race)\nFigure 6 Effect of the load on attenuation of the test bearing  \n \n6.2 Running test \n \nTwo types of defects were seeded on the inner and outer races. The seeded fault \nwas a surface line defect that was accomplished with an engraving machine. The \nnominal width, depth and length of the line defect on the outer and inner race was \nmeasured at 1mm, 75\u00b5m and 5mm for a \u2018small defect\u2019, while the \u2018large defect\u2019 \nhad a length of approximately 15mm, see figures 7 and 8. The test-rig was \noperated at three different rotational speeds; 600 rpm, 1500 rpm and 3000 rpm. \nFor each rotational speed three load cases were considered: 0kN, 2.4kN and \n4.8kN, and for every test condition a total of 100 data files were recorded. Prior to \nseeding defects the test-rig was operated to provide an indication of background \nnoise levels.  For background noise measurements the rig was operated at up to \n4000 rpm at 0KN. To simulate realistic diagnostic conditions, the timing of data \nacquisition was selected randomly within a 15-minute test period. It was felt that \nthis approach was representative of the likely method to be employed on \n 14\noperational units.  Maximum amplitude, energy and r.m.s values detailed were \ndetermined over the complete set of one hundred data files per simulation. AE \ncounts detailed are in effect an accumulation of counts of one hundred data files. \n \n \nFigure 7 Seeded line defect on outer race \n     \nFigure 8 Seeded \u2018small\u2019 and \u2018large\u2019 defects on the inner race \n \n \n \n \n \nLarge defect Small defect \nLine defect \n 15\n7. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \n \nIt must be noted that at the higher speeds (3000 and 4000 rpm), pre-amplification \nwas reduced to 40dB.

The percentage values selected were 10%, 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% with \ncorresponding threshold values of 0.17, 0.5, 0.85, 1.2 and 1.5 volts respectively. The \nreason for selecting these specific values was it offered a wide range of values, \nparticularly useful as the investigators hoped to ascertain and determine the influence \nof threshold value on AE count results. Usually determining the threshold levels have \nbeen at the discretion of the investigator and in most cases, the values were probably \nselected on intuition and\/or experience on the particular test-rig or machine.

DISCUSION \n \nBackground results clearly indicated a rise in r.m.s, peak amplitude and energy values \nwith increasing rotational speed, this also applied to seeded defects. In addition, at \nfixed rotational speeds there was evidence to suggest that increasing the load on the \ndefect also resulted in an increase in r.m.s and energy values. This was particularly the \ncase for both \u2018small\u2019 and \u2018large\u2019 outer race defects. On inner race defect simulations, \nthe same trend was observed for the \u2018small\u2019 defect only. For \u2018large\u2019 inner race defects \nthere was an increase in r.m.s value from 0KN to either 2.4 or 4.8KN, see figure 16.  \nFor fixed speeds and loads, increasing the defect size resulted in an increase in r.m.s \nvalue for outer race defects only. It was interesting to note that values of maximum \namplitude did not increase with increasing load though an increase in rotational speed \nresulted in an increase in AE maximum amplitude. \n \nComparing r.m.s values of background noise with defect conditions, see figure 25, it \nwas evident that r.m.s values for defect conditions at a fixed speed were greater than \nvalues associated with background noise at the same speed. This was also observed \nfor maximum amplitude and energy values. However for all inner race defects at \n0KN, the corresponding r.m.s values were undistinguishable from background noise \nlevels. Furthermore, the results showed that background noise at high rotational \nspeeds could mask defect signatures at lower operational speeds irrespective of the \nAE parameter measured, r.m.s, energy or amplitude. Therefore, in application of AE \nto bearing diagnosis, particularly on machinery operated over a range of speed \nconditions, it would be advisable to investigate background noise at all operational \nspeeds. \n 30\n0\n0.8\n1.6\n2.4\n3.2\nSp\need\n 60\n0 r\npm\nNo\nise\nDe\nfec\nt, L\n0\nDe\nfec\nt, L\n2\nDe\nfec\nt, L\n4\nSp\need\n 15\n00\n rp\nm\nNo\nise\nDe\nfec\nt, L\n0\nDe\nfec\nt, L\n2\nDe\nfec\nt, L\n4\nSp\need\n 30\n00\n rp\nm\nNo\nise\nDe\nfec\nt, L\n0\nDe\nfec\nt, L\n2\nDe\nfec\nt, L\n4\nSpeed and load conditions\nr.\nm\n.s \nva\nlu\ne \n(v\nol\nts\n)\nO uter race  defects\nInner race defects\n \n Figures 25 Background noise and \u2018large\u2019 defect AE r.m.s values for varying \nspeed and load conditions \n \nAn increase in AE counts with defect size, load and speed was more evident for outer \nrace defects. This very evident proportionality was also observed for r.m.s and energy \nvalues and probably explains why most reported successful experiments on the \napplications of AE to bearing diagnosis have been undertake on the outer race.  In \naddition, it suggested that an attenuation of just 12dB and 3dB (for r.m.s and \nmaximum amplitude values respectively, see appendix A) on inner race defect \nsignatures may limit the extent of applicability of AE to monitoring changes in \nbearing operating condition of inner races. This phenomenon will probably always \nhold true irrespective of bearing size as the attenuation on bearing components will be \nmore dependent on component interfaces than the geometric size. However, it must be \nnoted that the applicability of AE to inner race defect analysis is also dependent on the \nstrength of the AE source. \n 31\n \n0\n30000\n60000\n90000\n120000\n150000\nN\noi\nse\nSi\n15\nL\n0\nSi\n15\nL\n2\nSi\n15\nL\n4\nSo\n15\nL\n0\nSo\n15\nL\n2\nSo\n15\nL\n4\nL\ni1\n5L\n0\nL\ni1\n5L\n2\nL\ni1\n5L\n4\nL\no1\n5L\n0\nL\no1\n5L\n2\nL\no1\n5L\n4\nSmall defect\ninner race\nSmall defect\nouter race\nLarge defect\ninner race\nLarge defect\nouter race\nSpeed and load conditions\nN\no.\n o\nf A\nE\n c\nou\nnt\ns Threshold - 0.17V  \nThreshold - 0.5V  \nThreshold - 0.85V  \nThreshold - 1.2V  \nThreshold - 1.5V  \nFigures 26 Background noise and defect AE counts for varying load and \ndefects conditions; speed 1500 rpm \n \nComparing AE counts of background noise with defect conditions it was noted that \ninner and outer race defect count values were greater than background noise levels for \nload conditions above 0KN, see figure 26. As observed with r.m.s values, background \nnoise AE count at higher rotational speeds could mask defect conditions at lower \nspeeds. For selection of the most appropriate threshold level it would be advisable, \nbased on observations of this investigation, to select a threshold level at or above 30% \nof the maximum background amplitude for the lowest speed and load operating \ncondition. AE threshold levels at or above this percentage value have been shown to \nprovide direct correlation with defect size, load and speed, particularly for outer race \ndefects. For some cases considered, for instance, \u2018large\u2019 outer race defect at varying \nspeed and load conditions, a threshold level of less than 30% showed trends different \nfrom all other threshold levels, see figure 21. \n 32\n9.   CONCLUSION \n \nThe use of r.m.s and count values has been validated as a robust technique for \ndetecting bearing damage. Parameters such as r.m.s and energy have been shown to \ncorrelate with increasing speed, load and defect size. Values of AE maximum \namplitude did correlate with increasing speed but not with load and defect size. In \naddition, it has been shown that the relationship between bearing mechanical integrity \nand AE counts is independent of the chosen threshold level, although a threshold of at \nleast 30% of the lowest speed and load operating condition is advised. The application \nof AE to bearing defect diagnosis in this investigation showed more success in \nmonitoring the condition on the outer race. Unlike the results reported by Tandon & \nNakra [12] it was observed that AE counts could be used for defect size detection for \nlengths of up to 15mm and widths of 1mm. In addition, the observations of \nChoudhary et al [13] were validated. It may be concluded that there isn\u2019t an ideal \nthreshold that can be applied for analysis over all operating conditions. Therefore, in \napplication of AE to bearing diagnosis, particularly on machinery operated over a \nrange of speed conditions, it would be advisable to investigate background noise at all \nprocess operational speeds. \n \nIt is interesting to note that both r.m.s and AE count values could not distinguish \nbetween \u2018large\u2019 and \u2018small\u2019 defects on the inner race, though other operational \nchanges such as increases in load had direct effects on the AE parameters. Although \nthis investigation centered on a bearing with a rotating inner race, the authors believe \nthat the results presented would be applicable to a rotating outer race with a stationary \ninner race. Whilst numerous exotic diagnostic techniques such as wavelets, higher \n 33\norder statistics, neural networks, etc, could be employed to aid diagnosis, all attempts \nmust be made to keep the method of diagnosis simple and robust as this is the only \nway to encourage the adoption of this invaluable technique. \n \n10.
