Quite remarkably, this\npower is a very encouraging power figure that gives the\nprospect of being able to power a wider range of applications\nthan is currently possible in wireless sensor network.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe power output performance of energy harvesting\ndevices (EHDs) dictates device suitability for most\napplications, and the higher the power harvested, the wider\nthe application potential can be. Geometric parameters of\nEHDs and the electric loads connected to them can\nsignificantly influence the power output performance in an\nincreased or decreased manner. Recently Zhu et al. [1-2],\nusing a commercial finite element software, developed a\ncoupled piezoelectric-circuit finite element model (CPC-\nFEM), to model a vibration-based piezoelectric EHD that\nis directly connected to a load resistor. The CPC-FEM was\nused to predict the generated output power of the EHD\nwith different load resistor values while simultaneously\ncalculating the effect of the load resistor value on the\ndisplacement amplitude of the tip of the cantilever.\nFurthermore, Zhu and Worthington [3] used the CPC-FEM\nto perform a design study of the Piezoelectric EHD\n(PEHD), which is a cantilever sandwich structure with a\nseismic mass attached to the tip, for gaining an\nunderstanding of the influence of the geometric parameters\non the electric output performance of the device. The\nauthors also established a simplified analytical model of\nthe PEHD [4] that considers the effects of both the beam\nand mass geometric parameters; the simplified analytical\nmodel was used to optimize the design of the PEHD to\nobtain maximum power output with a volume of around\n1cm3. As mentioned above, the first study of this paper\nauthors was on the effects of the resistive load value on the\nelectric power output of the device and the displacement\namplitude of the tip of the cantilever [1-2]; the second was\non the effect of the geometric parameters on the power\noutput of the device [3], and the third was for optimizing\nthe dimensions for the generation of maximum power\noutput with a volume of 1cm3 [4]. This letter further\npresents our experimental study on the electric output\nperformance of the optimized PEHD when it is directly\nconnected to a variety of different resistive load values.\nThe main motivation of this letter is, based on\nexperimental results, to gain an understanding of how the\nresistive load connected with a vibration-based PEHD\naffects its power\/voltage output performance and to\ndemonstrate the power output of our optimized PEHD.\nII. CONFIGURATION OF PEHD\nFigure 1 shows a photo of the prototyped PEHD used in\nthe experimental study, which is based on the optimised\nconfiguration studied in [3-4]. Table 1 lists the material\nproperties and structural parameters of the PEHD. It is a\npiezoelectric bimorph cantilever with a seismic mass\nsymmetrically attached at the tip. The beam is a sandwich\nstructure with a central brass substrate layer and two\npiezoelectric material layers; one bonded to the top and the\nother to the bottom of the central brass layer. The surfaces\n(both top and bottom) of each piezoelectric layer are\ncovered by a thin nickel electrode, except for those\nportions of the layers that lie between the masses. The\nelectrodes were removed from these areas using FeCL3,\nferric chloride solution, in order to reduce the piezoelectric\n1 3\n2\n4\nFigure 1 Photo of the prototyped PEHD. Note: the dimensions shown in\nthe figure 1 are all in mm and the sandwich structure detail is not shown\nin the schematic; the thickness of 0.66mm includes the brass central layer\nthickness of 0.102mm and the two piezoelectric layer thicknesses, each of\n0.278mm. The photo shows a plan view of the PEHD clamped in the\naluminum holder, where: (1): the PEHD, (2): the aluminum holder, (3):\nthe accelerometer, and (4): the shaker armature. The total volume of the\nPEHD is around 1cm3.\nTable 1 Material properties and structural parameters of the\nprototyped PEHD\nSubstrate material: brass\nYoung\u2019s modulus (GPa) 110\nPoisson\u2019s ratio \u03bcs 0.23\nDensity (kg\/m3) 2330\nLength*\u00d7width\u00d7thickness (mm)\n*The total length of mass and piezoelectric layer\n18*\u00d73.1\u00d70.102\nPiezoelectric material: PSI-5H4E (Piezo Systems Inc,\nMassachusetts).\nYoung\u2019s modulus (GPa)\nE11\nE33\nPoission\u2019s ratio\nElastic constants:(GPa)\nC11\nC12\nC13\nC33\nC44\n62\n50\n0.3\n110.8\n49.8\n49.8\n110.8\n30.5\nDensity \u03c1p(kg\/m3) 7800\nPiezoelectric constants (\u00d710-12 m\/volt)\nd33\nd31\n650\n-320\nCoupling coefficients\nk33\nk31\n0.75\n0.44\nRelative dielectric constant \u03b533 3800\nMechanical quality factor Q 32\nLength\u00d7width\u00d7thickness (mm) 6\u00d73.1 \u00d70.278\nSeismic mass material: Tungsten alloy (M & I Materials\nLtd\/Wolfmet, Manchester, UK)\nYoung\u2019s modulus (GPa) 400\nPoisson\u2019s ratio \u03bcs 0.28\nDensity (kg\/m3) 18100\nLength\u00d7width\u00d7height (mm) 12\u00d78.2\u00d79.4\ncapacitance of the device, and so increase the output\nvoltage and power, since these areas don\u2019t generate the\nelectric charge and reduce the output voltage for the\nstudied case as the charge generated is limited. The\npiezoelectric layers are poled in the same direction, so that\nwhen the PEHD is subjected to acceleration, charge of the\nsame polarity appears on the outer electrodes of the\ndevice. Thus the device is wired so that the piezoelectric\nlayers are connected in parallel: the outside electrodes are\nconnected together to make one electrical output terminal,\nand the centre layer constitutes the other electrical output\nterminal. The volume of the PEHD is around 1cm3.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP AND TESTING APPROACHES\nFigure 2 shows a photo and schematic of the experimental\nsetup. The system is based on National Instruments\nhardware and software.

In the photo:\n(1) Laptop PC with Labview SignalExpress, (2) National Instruments\nCompactDAQ chassis with 9229 and 9263 modules, (3) Shaker power\namplifier, (4) Electromagnetic shaker, (5) Aluminum holder with PEHD\nand accelerometer, (6) Circuit board for accelerometer supporting\ncomponents, (7) Load-board, (8) Power supply for accelerometer, (9)\nPower supply for load-board.\nThe PEHD is clamped into an aluminium holder that is\nmounted on top of the shaker. Also on the aluminium\nholder is an ADXL103 accelerometer (Analog Devices,\nMassachusetts) which is used to show the input\nacceleration applied to the PEHD, thus placement of the\naccelerometer was chosen to be as close as possible to the\nfixed end of the beam. The accelerometer has a sensitivity\nof 1V\/g. The output of the PEHD is connected to a custom\nbuilt load-board. The load-board is essential for taking the\nmeasurements as it serves two purposes: firstly, it allows\ndifferent resistive load values (from 25k\u03a9 to 550k\u03a9 in\n25k\u03a9 steps) to be connected to the PEHD; secondly,\nthrough use of an instrumentation amplifier it isolates the\n1M\u03a9 input impedance of the analogue input module from\nthe PEHD output, presenting instead a 10M\u03a9 input\nimpedance to the PEHD. The output of the instrumentation\namplifier is connected to an input channel of the analogue\ninput module. The output of the accelerometer is\nconnected to another input channel.\nTo test the device, Labview SignalExpress software\n(National Instruments) was first used to generate an\nelectric signal to drive the shaker at a given frequency\n(chosen arbitrarily at 110Hz) while the amplitude of\nexcitation was manually adjusted using the control on the\npower amplifier until the chosen acceleration value of +\/-\n0.23g, which is based on [6], representing an ambient\nvibration from environment, and recorded on the\naccelerometer output. SignalExpress was then used to\nperform a series of frequency sweeps from 70Hz to\n110Hz; each sweep was performed with a different\nresistive load connected to the PEHD. The responses from\nthe accelerometer and PEHD were recorded at each\nfrequency integer within this frequency range, resulting in\ntwo collections of data for each restive load applied:\nacceleration applied to the PEHD versus frequency, and\nvoltage output of the PEHD versus frequency. Since the\ndata obtained from the accelerometer showed that the\nacceleration applied to the PEHD did not maintain the\nexactly required amplitude of +\/-0.23g over the frequency\nrange (possibly caused by the shaker\u2019s dynamic response),\nthe data from the accelerometer was used to rescale the\noutput voltage of the PEHD, so that any deviation from the\nrequired +\/-0.23g that occurred as the frequency changed\nwas accounted for. The purpose of rescaling the output of\nthe PEHD was to ensure that the voltage data obtained was\nrepresentative of a constant acceleration amplitude value\nover the frequency range of interest. The power output of\nthe PEHD was then calculated from (1).\nR\nV\nP\n2\n2\n\uf03d\n(1)\nwhere P is the output power of the PEHD (equivalent to\nthe power dissipated by the load resistor), R is the load\nresistor value, and V is the output voltage amplitude of the\nPEHD, measured across the load resistor.\nI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigure 3 shows the measured output voltages of the PEHD\nas a function of frequency and with various resistive loads,\nranging from 25k\u03a9 to 550 k\u03a9. From the figure, it can be\nobserved that the maximum output voltage (occurring at\nresonance) initially increases with the increase in resistive\nload value, and then starts to approach a level. For\nexample, the difference between the voltages obtained at\nresonance with k25 \uf057\uf03dR and k50 \uf057\uf03dR is 2.01V,\nwhereas the difference between the voltages obtained at\nresonance with k525 \uf057\uf03dR and k550 \uf057\uf03dR is only\n340mV. Furthermore, it can also be observed that the\nresonant frequency of the device gradually shifts to a\nhigher frequency as the resistive load increases. These\nresults agree with our previous simulation results obtained\nby using the CPC-FEM proposed in [1-2].\nFigure 3 shows that the output voltage of the PEHD\nincreases with an increase in the resistive load value.\nHowever, the output power of the PEHD doesn\u2019t increase\nwith the value of the resistive load because the power is\ndetermined by Equation (1). Based on Figure 3 and\nEquation (1), the power dissipated by the resistor as a\nfunction of frequency versus various electric resistances\ncan be easily calculated. Figure 4 shows the voltage\nmeasured across the load resistor and power dissipated by\nit versus load resistance values, where the data were\nextracted at the frequency of the peak of the curves. A\nmaximum output power of 370\u03bcW was generated into a\nresistive load of 325k\u03a9 at the operating frequency of 87Hz\nand under an acceleration of 0.23g. This power value is\ncomparable to those presented in [5-6], in which the power\noutputs reported were 365\u03bcW [5] and 335\u03bcW [6] for a\nvolume of around 1cm3 and under the same excitation\nacceleration. This is a very encouraging power figure that\ngives the prospect of being able to power a wider range of\napplications than is currently possible.\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n25 125 225 325 425 525\nV\no\nlt\nag\ne\nam\np\nli\ntu\nd\ne\n(V\n)\nP\no\nw\ner\nam\np\nli\ntu\nd\ne\n(m\nW\n)\nLoad Resistor Value (kW)\nPower\nVoltage\nFigure 4 Voltage measured across and power dissipated by the load\nresistor versus resistance value under their resonant frequency and an\nacceleration of 0.23g\n05\n10\n15\n20\n70 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110\nV\no\nlt\nag\ne\nam\np\nli\ntu\nd\ne\n(V\n)\nFrequency (Hz)\n25kW 50kW 75kW 100kW 125kW 150kW 175kW 200kW 225kW 250kW 275kW\n300kW 325kW 350kW 375kW 400kW 425kW 450kW 475kW 500kW 525kW 550kW\nFigure 3 Output voltage of the PEHD as a function of frequency with various resistive load values and under an acceleration of 0.23g\nII. CONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, the electric output performance of a\nvibration-based PEHD directly connected to a resistive\nload has been investigated experimentally based on our\noptimized PEHD, which is a cantilever with a sandwich\nstructure and seismic mass attached to the tip. A maximum\noutput power of 370\u03bcW at 15.5 volts into a 325k\u03a9\nresistive load was achieved at the operating frequency of\n87Hz and under an acceleration of 0.23g. . Quite\nremarkably, this power is a very encouraging power figure\nthat gives the prospect of being able to power a wider\nrange of applications than is currently possible in wireless\nsensor network. In addition, Our previous findings on the\neffect of the resistive load value on the voltage and power\ngenerated by the PEHD, particularly in terms of the shift in\nresonant frequency of the device, has been validated.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support from\nIMRC (the Cranfield Innovative Manufacturing Research\nCentre) via EPSRC (Engineering and Physics Science of\nResearch Council in the UK) entitled \u201cDesign and\nManufacturing of a Novel EHDs for Self Powered Sensors\nand ICT Applications\u201d (IMRC-137) and EPSRC Platform\nGrant entitled \u201cNanoscale Multifuctinal Ferroic Material\nand Devices\u201d (EP\/D506638\/1).\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.
