Introduction\nThe precipitation of energetic particles in, for example, au-\nroral arcs can result in small-scale longitudinal and latitudinal\nconductivity gradients. Such conductivity gradients, which can\nalso be highly variable in time, occur within localized regions of\nas little as 1\u201320 km, the width of auroral arcs. Strong conduc-\ntivity gradients modify the convection-driven electrojets and\nthe associated convection electric fields. Measurements of\nelectric fields, currents, and conductivities for a localized re-\ngion of 20 km or less are rather difficult for satellite, rocket,\nand most ground-based experiments. A concise summary of\nthe various relationships that have been found to exist between\nelectric fields and conductivities, in association with auroral\narcs, is given by Aikio et al. [1993], Marklund [1984], and Baum-\njohann [1983].\nThere have been numerous observations [Evans et al., 1977;\nHorwitz et al., 1978; Cahill et al., 1980; Stiles et al., 1980; de la\nBeaujardiere et al., 1981; Marklund et al., 1982; Ziesolleck et al.,\n1983; Bru\u00a8ning and Goertz, 1986; Timofeev et al., 1987; Opge-\nnoorth et al., 1990; Valladares and Carlson, 1991; Aikio et al.,\n1993; Lewis et al., 1994] of enhanced electric fields equator-\nward (poleward) of an arc in the premidnight (postmidnight)\nsector. In fact, this is a common feature of arcs at all local times\n[Opgenoorth et al., 1990]. Such regions of electric fields have\nbeen referred to as a \u201cradar arc\u201d because coherent radar back-\nscatter also occurs there. Timofeev et al. [1987] found that\npostmidnight radar arcs appear, or suddenly intensify, with the\noptical brightening of the associated auroral arc.\nAikio et al. [1993] have proposed the following scenario\nbased on satellite measurements. A current system associated\nwith auroral arcs consists of a matched pair of magnetic field-\naligned currents (FACs). The upward current flowing above\nthe arc and the downward return current flowing on the pole-\nward (equatorward) side of the arc in the postmidnight\n(premidnight) sector are connected by a Pedersen current in\nthe ionosphere. Since the Pedersen current will flow in the\ndirection of the convection electric field (equatorward post-\nmidnight and poleward premidnight), this determines on which\nside of the optical arc the radar arc is observed. The upward\ncurrent is carried by the energetic precipitating electrons re-\nsponsible for the auroral arc. The downward current is carried\nby upward fluxes of low-energy ionospheric electrons outside\nof the arc, resulting in a depletion of ionospheric conductivity\nin that region. If the magnetospheric process resulting in an\nauroral arc acts as a current generator, then the ionospheric\nelectric field has to modify itself in such a way that current\ncontinuity in the ionosphere is preserved. Therefore the me-\nridional electric field has to increase, in conjunction with an\nenhanced ionospheric Pedersen current, in order to support\nthe enhanced downward current due to the increased upward\ncurrent above the arc. Tsunoda et al. [1976] and Timofeev et al.\nCopyright 2000 by the American Geophysical Union.\nPaper number 2000JA900102.\n0148-0227\/00\/2000JA900102$09.00\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 105, NO. A11, PAGES 24,889\u201324,898, NOVEMBER 1, 2000\n24,889\n[1987] have shown that the radar aurora corresponds to down-\nward FACs linked to the visual aurora by an ionospheric Ped-\nersen current.\nNormally, it is difficult to make a quantitative analysis of the\nFACs, as there is no simple way to estimate the ionospheric\nconductivity distribution, or the particle flux, corresponding to\nthe auroral arc. For the event under study here, the European\nIncoherent Scatter facility (EISCAT) [Folkestad et al., 1983]\nwas not available, and the TV images were not calibrated in\nintensity or wavelength. However, two other experiments with\noverlapping fields of view were available: the Scandinavian\nTwin Auroral Radar Experiment (STARE) [Greenwald et al.,\n1978] for ionospheric plasma flows and electric fields and the\nScandinavian Magnetometer Array (SMA) [Ku\u00a8ppers et al.,\n1979] for geomagnetic field disturbances and the correspond-\ning equivalent currents. STARE is sensitive to electrostatic\nwaves in the auroral E layer at ;105 km altitude [Fejer and\nKelley, 1980]. The mean Doppler shift of these waves is used to\ndeduce good approximations of the speed and direction of the\nelectron Hall drift. This method gives two-dimensional maps of\nthe plasma flow, and hence the electric field, over a section of\nthe auroral oval at those locations where the ionospheric elec-\ntric field exceeds a threshold of ;15 mV\/m [Cahill et al., 1978].\nThe measurements are made with good spatial resolution\n(20 3 20 km) over a large area (500 3 500 km) and are carried\nout on a continuous basis with a time resolution of 10 s. The\nSMA consists of a two-dimensional array of 36 magnetometers\nlocated throughout much of Scandinavia and Finland [Ku\u00a8ppers\net al., 1979]. Within STARE\u2019s field of view (67.68\u201372.68N,\n13.58\u201326.08E) the array density maximizes with magnetometers\nlocated on a grid of about 120 3 120 km. The SMA was\ndesigned to operate continuously, with a time resolution of\n10 s, throughout the International Magnetometer Study period\nof 1977\u20131979. Extensive auroral substorm studies have been\nundertaken, partly including STARE [Untiedt and Baumjo-\nhann, 1993]. At the time of the event studied here (January 15,\n1980), not all of the stations were operational. However, some\n13 stations within STARE\u2019s field of view, and just beyond the\nperiphery, continued recording.\nSince the ground magnetic field disturbance depends on the\nheight-integrated horizontal ionospheric current density J, and\nbecause the ionospheric electric field E is connected to J by\nOhm\u2019s law via the Hall (\u00a5H) and Pedersen (\u00a5P) height-\nintegrated conductivities, it is possible to estimate the two-\ndimensional conductance distribution of the ionosphere if the\ntwo-dimensional equivalent current Jeq and E distributions are\nknown [Baumjohann et al., 1981; Inhester et al., 1981; Opge-\nnoorth et al., 1983a, 1983b]. For northern Scandinavia, both Jeq\nand E are known from measurements in the overlapping fields\nof view of STARE and the SMA. Inhester et al. [1992] showed\nthat, in many cases, this was uniquely possible with an estimate\nof the Hall to Pedersen conductance ratio a, which can be\nassessed using either optical [Mende et al., 1984; Robinson et\nal., 1989] or ground magnetic data [Vickrey et al., 1981; Schle-\ngel, 1988; Lester et al., 1996]. If a is measured locally by the\nEISCAT radar, even this assumption need no longer be nec-\nessary. Amm [1995] has implemented the concept of Inhester et\nal. [1992], called \u201cmethod of characteristics,\u201d into a comput-\nerized algorithm and extended it to spherical coordinates\n[Amm, 1998]. Using the 13 SMA stations still operating within\nor near STARE\u2019s field of view at the time of the event, it has\nbeen possible to reconstruct a realistic three-dimensional cur-\nrent system associated with the event discussed in this paper.\nWe derive the equation for FACs in the ionosphere to illus-\ntrate the importance of conductance gradients. Ohm\u2019s law in\nthe ionosphere is\nJ 5 \u00a5PE 1 \u00a5H~B\u02c6 3 E! , (1)\nwhere J is the current vector, E the electric field vector, \u00a5P and\n\u00a5H are the height-integrated Pedersen and Hall conductivities,\nrespectively, and B\u02c6 is the unit vector in the direction of the\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field.\nAssuming a vertical magnetic field with B\u02c6 pointing along the\nZ axis, z\u02c6 being the unit vector pointing downward, the FAC is\ngiven by\nJ \\ 5 div J 5 div ~\u00a5PE! 1 div @\u00a5H ~ z\u02c6 3 E!# . (2)\nExpanding (2),\nJ \\ 5 \u00a5P div E 1 \u201e\u00a5P ? E 1 \u201e\u00a5H ? ~ z\u02c6 3 E! 1 \u00a5H div ~ z\u02c6 3 E! .\n(3)\nThe last term of (3) is zero because\ndiv ~ z\u02c6 3 E! 5 E ? rot~ z\u02c6! 2 z\u02c6 ? rot~E! ,\nwhere E z rot(z\u02c6) 5 0 by definition and z\u02c6 z rot(E) 5 0 since we\nassume that a curl-free potential electric field exists in the\nionosphere. Hence\nJ \\ 5 \u00a5P div E 1 \u201e\u00a5P ? E 1 \u201e\u00a5H ? ~ z\u02c6 3 E! . (4)\nIt is clear that assuming uniform conductances (i.e., dropping\nthe last two terms of (4)) may lead to considerable errors in\ncomputing FACs, since the terms relating to the conductance\ngradients are of the same order, often larger, and can be of\nopposite sign to the first term in (4). In some studies [e.g.,\nSofko et al., 1995; Sato et al., 1995] the first term was named\n\u201cmagnetospheric FAC,\u201d while the remaining terms were\nnamed \u201cionospheric FAC\u201d by these authors. However, in the\ncoupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system, such a subdivision\nis not reasonable since ionospheric conductance gradients are\nthe consequence of magnetospheric processes, as in the\npresent study. The last two terms of (4) were also omitted, with\nsignificant consequences, in the previous study of the event\nrevisited here [Kosch et al., 1998].\nAny ionospheric current measurement from ground-based\nmagnetometers will include a component due to the motion of\nthe neutral thermosphere. The neutral dynamo effect can be\nexpressed in the following way:\nE 5 ~u 2 v! 3 B\u02c6, (5)\nwhere u is the neutral wind vector and v the ion flow vector.\nThe current vector J is affected by the neutral motion via\n(1). Clearly, the neutral wind opposes the ion flow and hence\nreduces the effective electric field. Since thermospheric neutral\nforcing is ion drag dominated [Killeen and Roble, 1984], the\nneutral wind speed shows a clear relationship with geomag-\nnetic indices such as Kp or AE [McCormac et al., 1987; Aruliah\net al., 1991]. Generally, thermospheric neutral motion follows\nthe ion convection pattern [Killeen and Roble, 1988, and refer-\nences therein] with an e-folding delay time of 1\u20133 hours\n[Killeen et al., 1984]. Neutral winds can be measured by ground-\nbased optical interferometers in the lower and upper thermo-\nsphere using the Doppler shift of the O1S 557.7 and O1D 630\nnm auroral emission lines [Kosch et al., 2000]. Although elec-\ntric field measurements by an incoherent backscatter radar,\nKOSCH ET AL.: PLASMA VORTEX REVISITED24,890\nsuch as EISCAT [Folkestad et al., 1983], would be affected by\nneutral winds because it measures ion flow directly, a coherent\nbackscatter radar such as STARE is not. This is because\nSTARE infers the electric field by indirectly measuring the\nelectron Hall drift, as explained earlier, which is not affected by\nneutral winds.\n2. Observations and Discussion\nThe results reported here were obtained by three high-\nresolution systems with overlapping fields of view: a low light\nlevel TV camera for optical imaging, the Scandinavian Twin\nAuroral Radar Experiment (STARE) [Greenwald et al., 1978]\nfor ionospheric plasma flows and electric fields, and the Scan-\ndinavian Magnetometer Array (SMA) [Ku\u00a8ppers et al., 1979] for\ngeomagnetic field disturbances and equivalent currents. Al-\nthough the event has been described in detail by Kosch et al.\n[1998], it will now be summarized to serve as background for\nthe new work.\nThe data examined here were obtained at 2135 UT on Jan-\nuary 15, 1980, after the Harang discontinuity that occurred at\n;2000 UT [Kosch et al., 1998]. Geomagnetic conditions were\nquiet with \u00a5Kp 5 122 on this day and Kp 5 11 for the\nperiod 2100\u20132400 UT, unusually low values for the auroral\nactivity observed. GEOS-2 satellite magnetometer and particle\ndata [Korth et al., 1978], obtained at geostationary orbit along\nthe Swedish meridian, show virtually no activity [Kosch et al.,\n1998]. An arc was imaged in white light by an all-sky low-light-\nlevel TV camera system operated from Skibotn (69.358N,\n20.368E, L 5 6), Norway. Simultaneously, STARE was ob-\nserving the ionospheric plasma flows within the TV imager\u2019s\nfield of view with a 10 s temporal resolution and 20 3 20 km\nspatial resolution. The SMA was recording the ground mag-\nnetic disturbance due to ionospheric currents, again with 10 s\ntemporal resolution. At 2134 UT a surge of luminosity prop-\nagated eastward along the arc at ;4 km\/s, causing enhanced\nbrightness and some distortion of the arc. It was during the\nenhanced brightening of the arc, which attained its maximum 1\nmin later, that a counterclockwise plasma vortex was observed\nby STARE. Simultaneously, a clockwise vortex in equivalent\ncurrent was observed in the SMA data.\nFigure 1 shows a mapping of the auroral image, reproduced\nfrom Kosch et al. [1998], recorded at 2135 UT onto a rectilinear\ngeographic grid, for an altitude of 100 km, to remove the\nall-sky spatial distortion. The apparent radial streaking in the\nimage near the edges is partially due to the vertical extent of\nthe aurora. The thickness of the arc is ;20 km. Superimposed\nis the grid of STARE E region plasma flow vectors with the\ndirection pointing away from each white dot. Locations with no\nvectors correspond to no radar backscatter. The radar data\nprojection is also for 100 km altitude. The patch of luminosity\nnear the southwest horizon is an artifact of artificial illumina-\ntion. A counterclockwise plasma vortex is visible centered be-\ntween 178 and 218 longitude and covers a region of about 180 3\n140 km in spatial extent. Westward drifts at higher latitudes\nmerge with eastward drifts at lower latitudes near the arc. The\nplasma vortex drifted eastward at about 700\u2013800 m\/s and is\nFigure 1. The white-light TV image of the east-west aligned arc after it had brightened, taken at 2135 UT\non January 15, 1980. The all-sky image has been mapped onto a rectilinear geographic grid, at an altitude of\n100 km, to remove the all-sky distortion. Superimposed is a grid of Scandinavian Twin Auroral Radar\nExperiment (STARE) plasma flow vectors, with the direction pointing away from each white dot. Locations\nwith no vectors correspond to no radar backscatter.\n24,891KOSCH ET AL.: PLASMA VORTEX REVISITED\nassociated with a moving distortion in the arc in the same range\nof longitudes. No radar backscatter was observed in the far\npoleward part of the STARE field of view or anywhere within\nor equatorward of the arc, indicating ionospheric electric fields\nbelow the 15 mV\/m threshold [Cahill et al., 1978].\nGiven the very quiet geomagnetic conditions prevailing\n(Kp 5 11) and that the convection electric field is frequently\nbelow the STARE detection threshold in the vicinity of the\nHarang discontinuity [Nielsen and Greenwald, 1979], this indi-\ncates that the observed plasma vortex is probably entirely due\nto mechanisms associated solely with the arc. The appearance\nof the plasma vortex at the same time as the sudden brighten-\ning of the auroral arc, together with the fact that the drifting\nplasma vortex coincided with a distortion of the arc moving at\nthe same speed, is strong evidence that the vortex is causally\nrelated to the activation of the arc [Kosch et al., 1998]. Timofeev\net al. [1987] show several examples of the appearance or in-\ntensification of a radar aurora associated with the brightening\nof a postmidnight auroral arc, consistent with our observation.\nFigure 2 shows a map of northern Scandinavia and Finland\nwith the field of view of STARE (dashed line), the lower\nborder of the auroral arc at 2135 UT on January 15, 1980 (solid\ncurve), and the location of each of the SMA stations (dots)\nused in this study. The thickness of the arc (;20 km) is equiv-\nalent to 0.28 in latitude extending southward. Table 1 gives a\nlist of the relevant SMA stations, including full names and\ngeographic locations. The vectors, with the direction pointing\naway from each SMA station, are the observed horizontal\nmagnetic field disturbance rotated clockwise by 908. Clearly,\neven the raw magnetometer data indicate a clockwise vortex\nstructure in equivalent current, which is consistent with the\nSTARE observation shown in Figure 1. The general direction\nof the current vectors, except for SOY and possibly MIK in the\nextreme north of the SMA, shows that northern Scandinavia is\nunder the westward electrojet and confirms that the event time\nis after the Harang discontinuity [Kosch et al., 1998].\nFigure 3 shows a stack plot of the raw magnetograms for the\nSMA stations shown in Figure 2 and listed in Table 1. The X\n(north), Y (east), and Z (vertical down) traces are given in\ngeographic coordinates by the solid, dashed, and dotted curves,\nrespectively, for 2100\u20132200 UT on January 15, 1980.

Equatorward of the\narc (;68.58N) and poleward of 708N the magnetic disturbance\ndeclines markedly, indicating the localized nature of the event.\nFortuitously, both the STARE and SMA signatures of the\nevent maximize above Skibotn during the optical recordings. It\nseems likely that the ground-based identification of the event\nassociated with the arc required a background of prevailing\nquiet geomagnetic conditions (Kp 5 11) together with close\nproximity to the Harang discontinuity. Under active or normal\nbackground convection electric field conditions, the vortex sig-\nnature may have been impossible to identify in the STARE and\nSMA data.\nInstantaneous spatial distributions of the ionospheric mac-\nroscopic electrodynamic parameters for 2135 UT on January\n15, 1980, are derived using the method of characteristics [In-\nhester et al., 1992; Amm, 1995, 1998]. If two-dimensional input\ndata of the ionospheric electric field and the ground magnetic\ndisturbance field are given, this method can infer distributions\nof ionospheric conductances, actual (not equivalent) iono-\nspheric currents, and magnetic field-aligned currents (FACs).\nBesides the data, only an approximation of the Hall to Ped-\nersen conductance ratio a has to be provided. This ratio can be\nmodeled by following statistical studies that show its close\nrelation to the general level of ground magnetic activity [Vick-\nrey et al., 1981; Schlegel, 1988; Lester et al., 1996]. Only a rough\nestimate of a is needed, since the influence of the ratio on the\nfinal results has been shown to be uncritical [Amm, 1995]. For\nthis study, the most realistic Hall to Pedersen conductance\nratio is taken to be 1.1, in correspondance with Kp 5 11 [cf.\nSchlegel, 1988]. Another computation has been done for a 5 2,\nwhich showed no significant differences, as expected. After\nextraction of the part of the ground magnetic disturbance field\ncaused by external sources and its field continuation to the\nionosphere, a two-dimensional partial differential equation,\nderived from Ohm\u2019s law and the current continuity condition\nin the ionosphere, is solved along its characteristics to obtain\nthe Hall conductance as a primary output. From this, together\nwith the input data, the remaining ionospheric electrodynamic\nquantities mentioned above can be inferred (for details, see\nAmm [1998]).\nThe advantages of this method, compared to other methods\nthat derive ionospheric electrodynamic parameters from\nground-based observations, are that the number of modeled\ninput parameters is reduced as much as possible, no uniformity\nof the conductances has to be assumed (as was the case in the\noriginal study of this event [Kosch et al., 1998]), and an error\nestimation is built into the method to obtain information on\nthe uniqueness and existence of the solution. Additionally, only\ndata from the period to be analyzed are needed, i.e., no merg-\ning of data from different intervals is required. In contrast,\nearlier methods that used \u201ccomposite vector plots\u201d of the input\ndata fields from different time intervals had to assume the\nmovement of a stationary pattern with constant velocity. In\nparticular, the method of characteristics has proven to be much\nfaster and provides more reliable and detailed results than the\n\u201ctrial and error\u201d method [Baumjohann et al., 1981; Inhester et\nal., 1981; Opgenoorth et al., 1983a, 1983b]. In this study, a\nspatial grid of 0.58 latitude by 28 longitude, corresponding to\nabout 50 3 80 km, respectively, has been used. For the inter-\npolation of the data onto a regular grid, including some ex-\ntrapolation of the ground magnetic data, the spherical elemen-\ntary current systems (SECS) method is used [Amm and\nViljanen, 1999]. It makes use of the fact that the equivalent\ncurrents are divergence-free and that the ionospheric electric\nfield is assumed to be curl-free, thereby preserving these fea-\ntures in the interpolated vector fields.\nApplying the method of characteristics, Figure 4a shows the\ntotal ionospheric horizontal current distribution in geographic\ncoordinates at 2135 UT on January 15, 1980. The lower border\nof the arc, projected at 100 km altitude, is also shown. It must\nbe emphasized that the vectors represent real and not equiv-\nFigure 3.

Comparing Figure 4a with Figure 1, it is clear\nthat the clockwise current vortex corresponds closely to the\ncounterclockwise plasma vortex. The effect of any neutral\nwinds (see equations (5) and (1)) has been neglected, as no\ndirect observations are available. This is justified since long-\nterm studies from Kiruna (;150 km south of Skibotn) [Aruliah\net al., 1991] and recent measurements from Skibotn [Cierpka et\nal., 2000; Kosch et al., 2000], using Fabry-Perot interferom-\neters, have shown that the meridional neutral wind speed is\n,100 m\/s for Kp , 2, which is similar to the event studied\nhere. The zonal wind speed for the time under study is close to\nzero. Such wind speeds correspond to an electric field of 5\nmV\/m, which is small in comparison to the measured electric\nfields discussed below (see Figure 4b).\nE region plasma flow drifts observed by coherent-backscat-\nter radar may be converted into equivalent ionospheric hori-\nzontal electric fields by rotating the vector clockwise through\n908 and setting 1000 m\/s \u2019 50 mV\/m (V 5 E 3 B). Using this\ntransform, Figure 4b shows the ionospheric horizontal electric\nfield distribution, corresponding to the drift velocity shown in\nFigure 1, in exactly the same format as Figure 4a. No compen-\nsation for neutral winds is necessary here, as discussed earlier.\nIn Figure 4b the electric field vectors near the arc, correspond-\ning to eastward plasma flow (see Figure 1), point approxi-\nmately toward the arc. This result is not unexpected, as it\nindicates a horizontal ionospheric current flowing into the arc,\nwhich is necessary to feed the upward FAC normally present in\narcs [Armstrong et al., 1975; Kamide and Akasofu, 1976a, 1976b;\nde la Beaujardiere et al., 1977; Evans et al., 1977; Cahill et al.,\n1980; Robinson et al., 1981; Marklund et al., 1982; Bru\u00a8ning and\nGoertz, 1986]. Aikio et al. [1993] and Timofeev et al. [1987] have\nshown examples of the electric field enhancement adjacent to\nan auroral arc being simultaneous with the optical brightening\nof the arc. These are consistent with our observation. The\nelectric fields north of the arc, corresponding to westward\nplasma flow (see Figure 1), point approximately away from the\narc. This is indicative of a downward FAC in the region around\n69.68N, where the electric field reverses, consistent with the\ndivergence of the electric field. The region of electric field\ndivergence, centered approximately on 69.68N and 218E, also\ncorresponds with the center of the horizontal current vortex.\nSince the Pedersen currents flow parallel to the electric field,\nthey are the main carrier of current between the downward\nFACs in the vortex and the upward FACs in the arc. However,\nPedersen currents and their associated FACs together produce\na nearly vanishing magnetic field below the ionosphere [Fuku-\nshima, 1976; cf. Amm, 1997]. Thus the ground magnetic effect\nis dominated by the Hall currents circulating clockwise around\nthe vortex (see Figure 4a).\nKnowledge of the ionospheric conductivity is essential for\ncomputing realistic FACs. In the original study of this event\n[Kosch et al., 1998] it had not been possible to make a realistic\nestimate of the ionospheric conductance distribution. For sim-\nplicity and on the basis of the low geomagnetic activity (Kp 5\n11), a uniform Pedersen conductance of 1 S was assumed.\nThis major limitation has now been removed by using the\nmethod of characteristics [Amm, 1998]. Figure 5a shows the\nquantitative Hall height-integrated conductivity distribution at\n2135 UT on January 15, 1980, in geographic coordinates. The\nlower border of the arc, projected at 100 km altitude, is also\nshown together with conductance contours plotted in siemens.\nClearly, the values of conductance are considerably higher\nthan unity. Furthermore, the Hall conductance varies from 4.5\nto 8.5 S, a variation of almost a factor of 2, in marked contrast\nto a spatially uniform conductance of unity assumed in the\noriginal study [Kosch et al., 1998]. It is this latter point that has\na most significant effect on the FACs, as will be discussed\nbelow. It is seen that the conductance measurement repro-\nduces the arc rather well except near the ends of the arc. The\nmismatch is due to the vertical extent of the arc which is\nmapped to the incorrect horizontal position near the edges of\nthe field of view, edge effects in the method of characteristics\nresulting from a lack of SMA stations around the periphery of\nthe field of view, and the absence of STARE backscatter equa-\ntorward of the arc. Considering the thickness of the arc (;20\nkm) and the spacing of the SMA stations (;120 km), the\nFigure 4. (a) Total horizontal ionospheric current and (b) electric field distributions at 2135 UT on January\n15, 1980, in geographic coordinates. The lower border of the arc, projected at 100 km altitude, is also shown.\nKOSCH ET AL.: PLASMA VORTEX REVISITED24,894\nconductance map reproduces the arc remarkably well. The\nPedersen conductance will have exactly the same distribution\nas Figure 5a, except that values will be reduced by a factor of\n1.1 owing to the initial assumption. The results show that even\nunder very quiet geomagnetic conditions (Kp 5 11), auroral\nprecipitation can still produce significant conductivity gradients.\nFigure 5b shows the identical conductance plot as in Figure\n5a without contour labels but with the STARE plasma flow\nvectors overlaid. The lower border of the auroral arc is again\nshown. It is very clear that the region of minimum conduc-\ntance, centered on about 70.18N and 218E, corresponds to the\ncenter of the counterclockwise plasma vortex. Equivalently,\nthis region corresponds to the center in the clockwise total\ncurrent vortex (see Figure 4a). If, as supposed above, this\nregion corresponds to a downward FAC, corresponding to the\nclosure current of the arc, then it would be expected that the\nconductance be reduced here. This would be consistent with\nthe fact that the downward current would have to be carried by\nionospheric thermal electrons accelerated upward. Removal of\nthese electrons with no immediate means of replenishment\n(e.g., convection) must reduce the local conductivity.\nOnce the electric field and conductance distributions are\nknown, the FACs can be computed using (4). Figure 6a shows\nthe FAC distribution at 2135 UT on January 15, 1980, in\ngeographic coordinates. The lower border of the arc, projected\nat 100 km altitude, is also shown. Circles (crosses) correspond\nto downward (upward) current. The entire region poleward of\nthe arc (;400 3 100 km) corresponds to downward current.\nThe downward FAC region westward of 178E is not associated\nwith the vortex and probably results from aurora to the north-\nwest outside the field of view (see Figure 1 at 70.88N), which\ncorresponds to the northwest pointing electric field vectors in\nthis region (see Figure 4b). Downward FAC amplitudes ap-\npear to be quite reasonable [Armstrong et al., 1975; de la Beau-\njardiere et al., 1977; Bru\u00a8ning and Goertz, 1986; Cahill et al.,\n1980; Evans et al., 1977; Marklund et al., 1982; Robinson et al.,\n1981], with an average of 0.8 mA\/m2 and reaching a maximum\nvalue of 1.7 mA\/m2. The downward current region results\nmostly from the diverging horizontal Pedersen currents (not\nshown). The auroral arc is expected to correspond to upward\nFAC carried by precipitating electrons. In the immediate vi-\ncinity of the arc the currents appear to be rather small and only\npartly upward. This lack of a clear signature is attributed to the\nnarrowness of the arc (;20 km), whereas the spatial grid for\nthe method of characteristics is 80 3 50 km. Reducing the\nspatial grid will achieve no better resolution as, the SMA\nstations have an average spacing of only ;120 km within the\nstudy area. This spacing is justified on the grounds that, given\nan altitude of maximum ionospheric conductivity at ;100 km\nabove the ground, magnetic field variations with wavelengths\n,200 km will be strongly attenuated [Ku\u00a8ppers et al., 1979]. This\neffectively limits the spatial resolution achieveable to ;100\nkm. Therefore the \u201cmissing\u201d part of the upward FAC due to\nthe arc would have appeared in the grid points equatorward of\nthe southern boundary of the analysis area. Unfortunately, the\nlack of STARE backscatter equatorward of the arc does not\npermit any detailed analysis in this region.\nThe closure current region of the arc has a radius of ;100\nkm; hence it covers an area of p 1002 \u2019 31,400 km2 with an\naverage current density of 0.8 mA\/m2. Assuming that this cor-\nresponds to the length of the arc equatorward of the vortex\n(17 2 258 longitude), for an arc thickness of 20 km, the area of\nthe arc is 320 3 20 5 6400 km2. Furthermore, assuming that all\nof the downward FAC in the plasma vortex closes only with\nupward FAC in the selected section of the arc, the average\nupward FAC density in the arc is estimated to be 3.9 mA\/m2.\nThis is consistent with previous observations [Armstrong et al.,\n1975; de la Beaujardiere et al., 1977; Bru\u00a8ning and Goertz, 1986;\nCahill et al., 1980; Evans et al., 1977; Marklund et al., 1982;\nRobinson et al., 1981]. It is concluded that Figure 6a is a\nrealistic representation of the FAC distribution for the down-\nward FACs poleward of the arc.\nFigure 5. (a) The ionospheric Hall conductance distribution, in siemens, at 2135 UT on January 15, 1980,\nin geographic coordinates. The lower border of the arc, projected at 100 km altitude, is also shown. A\nHall-to-Pedersen conductance ratio of 1.1 is assumed. (b) The same conductance plot with the grid of\nScandinavian Twin Auroral Radar Experiment (STARE) plasma flow vectors superimposed.\n24,895KOSCH ET AL.: PLASMA VORTEX REVISITED\nIn the original study of this event [Kosch et al., 1998] an\nimportant point was that, for the first time using ground-based\ndata, it was possible to identify the spatial region, associated\nwith an auroral arc, which constituted a closed current sheet\npair linked to the magnetosphere. This was possible since the\nplasma vortex was causally linked to the arc and hence the\nregion of downward FAC was likewise causally linked to the\narc, i.e., a region of upward FAC. Figure 6b shows the previous\nresult in the same format as Figure 6a. Figure 6b is a copy of\nFigure 8 of Kosch et al. [1998], reproduced for comparison\npurposes. This earlier work did not include the SMA data;\nhence no conductivity measurements were available. Figure 6b\nwas generated by assuming a uniform conductance (1 S) and\ncomputing the FACs solely from the divergence of the STARE\nelectric fields. This corresponds to using only the first term of\n(4). It is seen that a much more localized region (160 3 20 km)\nof downward current results [Kosch et al., 1998] when com-\npared to Figure 6a. The expanded region of downward current\nin Figure 6a results directly from horizontal conductivity gra-\ndients (see Figure 5a), which previously could not be ac-\ncounted for. The spatial grid used in the method of character-\nistics (50 3 80 km), which is limited by the SMA data as\nexplained earlier, could also contribute to the smearing out of\nthe region of downward current. However, this is a secondary\neffect. In Figure 6b the grid size is much smaller (20 3 20 km)\nbecause it is limited by the STARE data only. Had there been\nno horizontal conductivity gradients, Figures 6a and 6b would\nbe identical except for a simple scaling factor. Auroral precip-\nitation produces significant horizontal conductivity gradients,\nwhich cannot be ignored when computing FACs.\nIt is seen that the conductance gradients have a significant\neffect on the distribution of the closure current associated with\nthe arc. Although it seems clear that the auroral arc can be\nconsidered to be an upward FAC sheet localized in space, the\ndownward FAC area, which constitutes the return current in\nthis event, is centered on the apex of the plasma vortex with a\nradius of ;100 km. This is considerably larger than the return\ncurrent area found in the previous study [Kosch et al., 1998],\nthe increase being approximately an order of magnitude.\nHence ionospheric conductance gradients tend to broaden the\ndownward FAC region and so decrease the FAC area density.\nThe larger analysis grid size imposed by the SMA data may\nalso contribute in a small way to the broadening of the down-\nward FAC region.\n3. Black Aurora\nBlack aurora have been reviewed by Kosch et al. [1998].\nMarklund et al. [1997] describe Freja satellite observations that\nhave been associated with black aurorae, although there were\nno direct optical observations. There are a number of striking\nsimularities with the event studied here. These include diverg-\ning electric fields in a region of very low electron precipitation\n(i.e., no auroral emission): this region has a depleted conduc-\ntivity and contains downward FAC, which is associated with\nthe upward acceleration of low-energy ionospheric electrons.\nThe positive counterpart, namely, the auroral arc, was adjacent\nto the presumed black aurora. Many of their observations\noccurred near magnetic midnight, similar to our observation.\nFor the same event studied here, Kosch et al. [1998] found\nstrong circumstantial evidence that the plasma vortex was co-\nlocated with a black aurora. Unfortunately, this could not be\nconfirmed conclusively from the all-sky optical data. However,\nSchoute-Vanneck et al. [1990] found a total of 186 black auro-\nrae from the same data set only 4 min after the event described\nhere. These were observed with a small field of view TV cam-\nera centered on the zenith over Skibotn. Unfortunately, this\ncamera did not cover the region of sky where the plasma vortex\noccurred. There are some differences also. We do not observe\nthe intense small-scale (1\u20132 km) electric fields (150 \u2013300\nmV\/m) described by Marklund et al. [1997]. However, this may\nsimply be due to our limited spatial resolution, resulting in\nFigure 6. (a) The measured field-aligned current distribution assuming a Hall-to-Pedersen conductance\nratio of 1.1. (b) The equivalent field-aligned current distribution, from electric field data only, assuming a\nconstant Pedersen conductance of 1 S. Circles and crosses represent downward and upward magnetic\nfield-aligned currents, respectively. The lower border of the arc, projected at 100 km altitude, is also shown.\nKOSCH ET AL.: PLASMA VORTEX REVISITED24,896\naveraging. We conclude that the plasma vortex was probably\ncolocated with a black aurora, which we associate with the\nsudden brightening of the auroral arc.\n4. Conclusions\nAt a geomagnetically quiet time (Kp 5 11) an auroral arc\noptically brightens following the passage of an eastward surge.\nThis has been causally related to an ionospheric plasma vortex\npoleward of the arc in which STARE plasma drift vectors\nrotate counterclockwise [Kosch et al., 1998]. Combining\nSTARE equivalent electric fields with the SMA equivalent\ncurrents allows the conductance distribution to be calculated\nand hence the real three-dimensional currents to be computed.\nThe entire plasma vortex coincides with a region of downward\nmagnetic field-aligned current (FAC), i.e., the closure current\nfor the upward FAC above the arc. The plasma vortex center\ncoincides with a minimum in conductance, which is expected\nfrom the upward flow of thermal electrons. The closure current\nregion of the arc covers approximately p 1002 \u2019 31,400 km2,\nwhich is much more extensive in area than previously reported\n(3200 km2) [Kosch et al., 1998]. This results directly from hor-\nizontal conductivity gradients that previously could not be ac-\ncounted for. Even during very quiet geomagnetic conditions,\nconductance gradients, resulting from auroral precipitation,\ncannot be neglected when computing FACs. There is circum-\nstantial evidence that the plasma vortex may be colocated with\na black aurora.\nThis study has used data from a single point in time: a\nsnapshot. We speculate that the spatial extent of the closure\ncurrent of an arc may develop with time. For example, assum-\ning that the downward closure FAC is somewhat spatially lo-\ncalized, it would be expected that the thermal electrons, which\ncarry this current, would be accelerated upward, thereby re-\nducing the local conductivity. Either conductivity gradients\nwould be created or existing ones would be enhanced. Such a\nsituation would automatically result in a spreading out of the\nclosure current region because the horizontal currents feeding\nthe closure FAC have to cross regions of changing conductiv-\nity; that is, the last two terms of (4) are increasingly invoked\nwith time. The changing spatial morphology of arc-associated\nclosure currents will be the topic of future work.\nAcknowledgments.
