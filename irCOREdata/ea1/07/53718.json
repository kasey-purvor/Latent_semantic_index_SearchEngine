A. Butler \n(Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer, 1951-5) and Hugh Gaitskell (Labour Chancellor, \n1950-1 and Shadow Chancellor, 1951-5), used to describe the general acceptance of \nKeynesian economics and demand management of the economy (for example, Howard, \n1987). This branch of Conservatism has often sought to identify its ideas with those of \nDisraeli and his concern with the social divisions (or \u201etwo nations\u201f) associated with \nindustrialisation identified in his novel Sybil, and has been linked with Baldwin in the 1920s, \nwho drew on Disraeli\u201fs ideas but spoke of \u201eOne Nation\u201f (Tyrie, 2006) as part of his \narguments for a moderate and inclusive form of Conservatism (Walsha, 2003). However, it \nwas arguably only in the post war period, with the emergence and activities of the One \nNation Group of Conservative MPs, that One Nation Conservatism became of particular \nimportance as a strand of Conservative thinking. This article considers the nature of One \nNation Conservatism in the period from 1951 to 1964 through an examination of the One \nNation Group, its key publications, and the policies pursued by the Conservative \ngovernments of the time. It suggests that the link between the One Nation Group and \nConservative policies may not be as clear as is sometimes implied, and that it was the \ncombination of a somewhat more positive and pragmatic approach to the welfare state, and \nthe economic growth of the period, rather than any new and significant commitment to social \njustice and tackling poverty, that have helped shape perceptions of One Nation Conservatism \nover the past fifty years.  \n \n \nThe One Nation Group \n \nEven before Labour\u201fs 1945 election victory the paternalistic tradition and the pragmatic \nnature of much Conservative thinking meant that the Conservative Party was willing to \nsupport state intervention in welfare to ameliorate social disadvantage, particularly where this \nwas seen as appropriate to develop or protect Britain\u201fs economic interest or development. \nThe Baldwin government of 1924 to 1929 had the avowed objective of reconciling the bitter \ndifferences in the country and did introduce reforms driven in large part by Neville \nChamberlain, such as improvements in unemployment and health insurance, the extension of \nold age pensions, and the encouragement of local authorities to develop hospital provision. \nBut at the same time, unemployment remained high, particularly in areas where coal, heavy \nindustry and textiles were suffering from a loss of their export markets, and there was \nextensive use of means-testing.  \n \nDuring the Second World War Churchill\u201fs Conservative-led coalition government introduced \nthe 1944 Education Act, with the intention of improving educational opportunities for all, the \n1945 Family Allowances Act, and published plans for major improvements in health care and \nsocial security. During the 1945 general election campaign they retained a generally positive \napproach to social and economic intervention including a commitment to high levels of \nemployment, and promises to build at least 220,000 homes in the first two years in office, to \ndevelop a compulsory National Insurance scheme, and to create a comprehensive health \nservice with no one excluded from treatment because of an inability to pay.  \n \nFollowing Labour\u201fs election victory some more progressive Conservatives called for a \nclearer statement of principles for the Party in the post-war era, and in particular for support \nfor the \u201eOne Nation\u201f vision as a way forward. Such demands were arguably reflected in the \npublication of The industrial charter (Conservative and Unionist Central Office, 1947), \nwhich, while reaffirming the Party\u201fs commitment to free enterprise, also said that the Party \nwould seek cordial relations with the trade unions and maintain a level of demand which \nwould offer jobs to all who were willing to work. In the run-up to the 1950 election The right \nroad for Britain (Conservative and Unionist Central Office, 1949), while stressing the need \nfor efficient industrial production, \u201egood housekeeping\u201f and the need to curb public \nexpenditure, also spoke of unemployment as a \u201eheavy and growing danger\u201f (p. 15), stated that \nthe Party was sympathetic to Labour\u201fs welfare reforms, such as National Health Service, \nfamily allowances and national assistance, and said that the Conservatives would continue to \n\u201emaintain the range and scope of these Services, and the rates of benefit\u201f (p. 42). \n \nFollowing the Conservatives\u201f 1950 general election defeat, nine newly-elected backbench \nMPs, including Edward Heath, Iain Macleod, Angus Maude and Enoch Powell, formed the \nOne Nation Group, the publications and ideas of which have frequently been seen as \nunderpinning the Conservatives\u201f approach to social policy through the 1950s and into the \n1960s. The apparent influence of the group was perhaps reinforced by the number of its \nmembers who were promoted to the ministerial ranks, a pattern that continued with later \nrecruits such as Keith Joseph, Reginald Maudling and Geoffrey Rippon. \n \nOne Nation Group publications \n \nThe One Nation Group produced a series of pamphlets during this period which aimed to set \nout a vision for post-war Conservative policy. The first, One nation: a Tory approach to \nsocial problems (Conservative Political Centre, 1950), was intended to help develop a \ndistinctively Conservative approach to social policy (Walsha, 2000). It  highlighted a \n\u201efundamental disagreement\u201f (p. 9) between Conservative and Labour approaches to social \npolicy, emphasising that the Conservatives would prioritise economic stability, administrative \nefficiency, selectivity and a minimal level of services, contrasting these with what they saw \nas Labour\u201fs commitment to egalitarian social expenditure, universalism and optimal levels of \nprovision, and suggesting that in relation to the redistribution of wealth the economic and \nsocial optimums had been passed and that the future well-being of the poorest and the social \nwell-being of the nation were being endangered by the effects of redistribution. It reinforced \narguments for traditional Conservative concerns, such as industrial efficiency, low taxation, a \nstable currency, self-reliance, voluntarism and charitable activities, whilst at the same time \nsuggesting that positive support for state intervention would complement, rather than \nchallenge, the progressive role of the market. It also argued that the state should provide a \n\u201eminimum standard, above which people should be free to rise as far as their industry, their \nthrift, their ability or their genius may take them\u201f (p. 9). And whilst it criticised many aspects \nof Labour\u201fs approach it stated that \u201eSocial reform is not an exact science, nor is there an end \nto it. If no dramatic advance is possible for some years \u2013 and the urgent claims of Defence are \ncertain to prevent it \u2013 there is still the not less important administrative task of making the \nWelfare State work\u201f (p. 16). The pamphlet argued that there was a need to prioritise, and that \nhousing and education should be the main priorities, with the building of new homes and \nother emergency measures being necessary to reduce homelessness and improve standards of \nhealth, and the provision of primary education and then technical schools and colleges being \nkey to an industrial nation, whilst it proposed restraint in relation to social security benefits \nand pensions. The authors argued for a \u201eprinciple of the guaranteed standard of life and \nsecurity, below which none shall be allowed to fall\u201f (p. 73) being the main purpose of state \nprovision and that the government should be responsible for maintaining full employment. \n \nTwo years after the publication of One nation, two of its authors, Macleod and Powell, \nproduced The social services: needs and means (Macleod and Powell, 1952). In this \npamphlet they argued that high taxes were a disincentive to work and that the growth of the \nwelfare state was leading to a decline in individual initiative and in family responsibility and \nquestioned the provision of welfare without a means test. They also suggested that social \npolicy was moving too far from the contributory and insurance principle, with social security \nand the National Health Service being based too much on expenditure from general taxation, \nand argued both for the NHS to be financed on an insurance basis and for the reintroduction \nof charging as a means of finance. The pamphlet argued that \u201eGiven that redistribution is a \ncharacteristic of the social services, the general presumption must be that they will be \nrendered only on evidence of need, i.e. of financial inability to provide each particular service \nout of one\u201fs own or one\u201fs family\u201fs resources\u201f (p. 5) and that this was inappropriate so that \n\u201eThe question which therefore poses itself is not, \u201cShould a means test be applied to a social \nservice?\u201d but \u201cWhy should any service be provided without a test of need?\u201d\u201f (Macleod and \nPowell, 1952, p. 5). However, Macleod and Powell also argued that where services provide a \n\u201epublic and general benefit\u201f (p. 7), as they suggested was the case with education, although \nnot the health service, then it should be provided free of charge. \n \nAnother One Nation group publication, Change is our ally (Powell and Maude, 1954) \nquestioned the role of government in the economy and central planning, and argued for a \ngreater emphasis upon market forces, with more competition and risk-taking and investment \npredominantly by the private sector, rather than governments. This increasing emphasis on \nthe free market may reflect Powell\u201fs growing influence on the Group (Walsha, 2000). The \nintroduction to the pamphlet did, however, argue \u201eTo the Tory the nation is not primarily an \neconomic entity. It may place political and social ends above economic ones, and for their \nsake may justifiably on occasion seek to prevent change or divert it\u201f (Powell and Maude, \n1954, p. 7). \n \nIn 1959 the One Nation group produced The responsible society (Conservative Political \nCentre, 1959), which argued that such a society could never be achieved on the basis of state \naction alone, but must look to \u201ethe satisfaction of religious belief and action, and to the \nfulfilment of the social responsibilities which rest on all its members, individually, as \nfamilies, and in other groupings\u201f (p. 9). Ideas of voluntarism, individualism and self-reliance \nwere recurring themes. Yet, whilst favouring lower levels of taxation and individual\u201fs \nproviding for themselves, the pamphlet nevertheless stated that \u201eThe social services for the \nmost part are here to stay: in an increasingly complex society they have come to provide a \nminimal framework of amenity\u201f (p. 31) and that \u201eThe Welfare State, combined with full \nemployment and high earnings, has added to the freedom of the citizen\u201f (p. 34). However, for \nservices such as health and pensions, the pamphlet supported a shift from payment through \ntaxation to payment by contributions. It also noted the perceived political reality that \n\u201eSuccessive general elections have been fought on the understanding that the Party which \ndoes most for the social services will fare best\u201f (p. 33). \n \nThis series of pamphlets perhaps serves to illustrate that an attempt to identify the key \nprinciples of One Nation Conservatism is not straightforward, even when restricted to the \nOne Nation Group itself. From its early days the Group itself comprised individuals with \nvaried political views, and perhaps not surprisingly, the ideas put forward in their \npublications also varied. In reality, in the most significant publication, One nation, there was \nrelatively little which had not already been foreshadowed in official party statements, \nincluding The right road for Britain. In terms of ideas and policy proposals One nation \nclearly drew on traditional Conservative concerns but it also sought to react to the perceived \nnew reality of the post war years, including the welfare state, even if these were presented as \npart of gradual creation of \u201eThe social service state\u201f (p. 14) by \u201eConservative, Liberal, \nCoalition and Socialist Governments\u201f (p. 15). Whilst the One Nation group opposed equality \nas a political principle (Hickson, 2005) and wished to check the growth of collectivism and \nencourage greater choice in social policy, they did not therefore recommend any immediate \nradical changes in the structure of the post war settlement. What the publication of One \nnation did do was to provide a broad rationale for the Conservatives\u201f approach to social \npolicy based upon the idea that whilst the state had grown too big and taken on \nresponsibilities better undertaken by citizens and civil society, there was nevertheless a case \nfor state intervention in appropriate areas of economic and social life and particularly in \nensuring minimum standards in social provision, whilst at the same time arguing for a shift \ntowards individual effort and achievement. In doing this it supported the view that the Party \nhad responded to the new demands of the post-war period. Its reception, including selling \n8,500 copies (Walsha, 2000), also reinforced the view of the One Nation Group as a \nsignificant influence upon the Party\u201fs leaders.  \n \nHowever, perhaps more entrenched and less pragmatic right-wing opposition to big \ngovernment and the welfare state was clear in the writings of scholars such as Hayek (1944, \n1960), Lees (1961) and Seldon (1961), and in the creation of the Institute of Economic \nAffairs in 1957, followed by other right-wing \u201ethink tanks\u201f which were committed to free \nmarket economics and the rolling back of the state. In addition, whilst the ideas of the One \nNation Group have perhaps generally been associated with a progressive Conservatism in \nkeeping with the approaches of individuals such as Butler, Eden and Macmillan, arguments \nsuch as those for retrenchment of taxation and means-testing have also been traced through to \nThatcherism. The reality is that both views have some truth, and indeed are not necessarily \nincompatible, given that the Group\u201fs publications reflected the context of the time and the \noften varying and competing views of a range of individuals. \n \n \nConservative social policy 1951-64 \n \nAny examination of the Conservative Party\u201fs general election manifestos from the period \nmakes clear the general acceptance of, or at least an unwillingness to express opposition to, \nmost aspects of the welfare state. Whilst emphasising traditional Conservative themes such as \ntaxation and freedom, the 1951 manifesto highlighted the need for new homes, albeit with a \npreference for owner occupation, and promised to make better use of the money being spent \non education and health, and to help those pensioners in the greatest need. Similarly the 1955 \nmanifesto stressed the need for an efficient and productive economy, and a desire for lower \ntaxes, but also emphasised full employment, slum clearance and investment in education, as \nwell as a desire for \u201ethe best National Health Service the country can afford\u201f. In 1959 the \nConservatives noted the success of the preceding governments in providing \u201eover two million \nnew homes and almost two million new school places, a better health service and a modern \npensions plan\u201f, and whilst the manifesto promised to defend grammar schools it also \nundertook to bring modern schools up to the same high standard, to continue programmes of \nhouse and hospital building and to \u201eensure that those dependent on national assistance have a \nshare in the country\u201fs increasing prosperity\u201f. Even in 1964 the manifesto continued to stress \nfull employment, educational expansion and improvements to hospital and housing stock. \n \nFollowing a narrow general election victory in 1951 the Conservatives\u201f commitment to the \nwelfare state was tested when the government was faced with a significant balance of \npayments deficit. The new Chancellor, R. A. Butler, decided to reduce imports, tighten \nmonetary policy and review public expenditure commitments. However, despite some \nchanges to welfare expenditure, such as the introduction of some charges for the NHS, and a \nreduction in the building programme for schools, there were no draconian cuts in the welfare \nbudget. Indeed, whilst the concerns over public expenditure which led to the establishment of \nthe Phillips Committee (1953) on the Economic and Financial Problems of Provision for Old \nAge and the Guillebaud Committee (1956) into the Cost of the National Health Service, were \nperhaps indicative of the Conservatives\u201f general approach to welfare, there was no attempt to \ndismantle the welfare state that had been created by the Attlee government. Whilst the \nPhillips Committee recommended that government should abandon any attempt to raise \nretirement pensions to subsistence level because of the burden it would place on public \nfinances, the Guillebaud report found that the NHS was well run and effective and that there \nwas no evidence of extravagant spending, and made recognised that rather than cuts in \nexpenditure there would be a need for increases in the future. At this time, in addition to \nButler as Chancellor, the appointment of more progressive ministers in areas such as \neducation (Eccles, 1954-7) and health (Iain Macleod, 1952-5) appeared to further establish \nOne Nation thinking within the Party. During this government it could therefore be argued \nthat something of a distinctive \u201eOne Nation\u201f approach to state welfare was emerging, with an \nemphasis upon targeting, restraints on expenditure and greater use of charging.  \n \nFollowing further victories in the 1955 and 1959 general elections and under the leadership of \nAnthony Eden (1955-7), Harold Macmillan (1957-1963) and Alec Douglas-Home (1963-4) \nthe Conservatives continued to pursue a broadly One Nation approach, seeking to balance \ntraditional Conservative economic concerns, such as low taxation and price stability, with \nsocial concerns such as the maintenance of full employment and broad support for the \nwelfare state. However, this was not always straightforward, and in the mid-1950s as \neconomic growth slowed, in an attempt to prevent tax increases immediately following the \n1955 general election the Treasury reviewed the prospects for social expenditure, noting the \nrising costs of education from the growing school population as a result of the post war \ngrowth in the birth rate and that pensioners would start to earn rights to a pension under the \npost-war scheme. In response the spending departments mounted an organised opposition, \narguing, for example, that some parts of social expenditure had economic benefits. Following \ncontinuing concerns within the Treasury about the growing costs of welfare provision, in \nJanuary 1958 the Chancellor, Peter Thorneycroft, and two cabinet colleagues (Enoch Powell \nand Nigel Birch), resigned after the Cabinet refused to agree a request for \u00a3153 million cuts \nin welfare expenditure that were intended to help reduce inflation and restore international \nconfidence in sterling. In 1961 another sterling crisis saw the Treasury again seeking cuts in \nsocial spending, whilst around the same time an internal Conservative Party review suggested \nthat policies such as the withdrawal of the universal state pension and the introduction of fees \nfor state schools would help restrain the growth of welfare spending. Although such changes \nwere arguably too radical for the Party\u201fs leadership of the time, a range of more modest \nmeasures were introduced with the aim of cutting welfare spending, such as increased health \nand social security contributions and higher rents for council tenants. \n \nHousing \n Following the Second World War the Labour government had prioritised local councils as the \nmain source of new housing but many Conservatives favoured private building for owner \noccupation. One nation had argued that \u201eHousing is the first of the social services\u201f (p. 10) and \nargued that the volume of housing build by the private sector should be increased and that \nrent controls should be reformed. The Party set itself a target of building 300,000 houses a \nyear at the 1950 Party Conference, and repeated this in the 1951 manifesto, but with a much \ngreater emphasis than Labour on private sector construction, private landlords and renting, \nand owner occupation. However, the 300,000 figure could not be met by the private sector in \nthe short term and there was therefore a need for more public expenditure on the building of \ncouncil homes. But the Conservatives tightened the controls and design limits, aiming to \nprovide a cheap and plentiful form of housing, whilst approvals for the proportion of houses \nwith three or more bedrooms was reduced significantly, from four-fifths under the Labour \ngovernment to two-fifths by the end of the 1950s. This period saw owner occupation and \nlocal authority tenancy grow, together with a major decline in the private rented sector, \naccelerated from the mid-1950s by slum clearance, which itself reinforced the view of many \nthat private landlords had \u201efailed\u201f (Green, 2002). In an attempt to revive the private rental \nmarket the government reduced the control of rents through the 1957 Rent Act, but one of the \nmain results of this was to enable landlords to evict people and sell properties that had \npreviously been let into owner occupation (Hill, 1983). From the mid-1950s there was a \ndesire to maintain the mixed economy of housing provision so that subsidies for the building \nof council homes were reduced and there was increased pressure on local authorities to sell \ncouncil homes, including through the provision of mortgages (Lowe, 1993). However, the \nprivate rental market continued to be seen as problem and the Housing Act 1961 allowed \nlandlords to raise rents only after improving their properties. \n \nEducation \n \nAs noted above, both One nation and The social services: needs and means had emphasised \nthe importance of education, with the former even arguing that so long as the Cold War \ncontinued \u201eEducation is more than a social service; it is part of Defence\u201f (p. 39). Given the \nConservatives\u201f part in the passage of the Butler Act it is perhaps unsurprising that in general \nthis period saw an increase in the resources available for state education. The post-war \u201ebaby \nboom\u201f meant that there was in any case a need for more schools and teachers, but a series of \nreports (for example, Central Advisory Council for Education, 1954, 1959; Robbins, 1963) \narguably both highlighted the importance of education and influenced policy development. \nThe Education Act 1944 had laid the foundations for a system of secondary education \ngrounded in the idea of selection through the \u201e11-plus\u201f examination, with some children \nprogressing to grammar schools and others to secondary moderns, and in some places \ntechnical schools. However, during the 1950s a number of local authorities began to \nintroduce an alternative model, comprehensive schools, but the Conservative Party, including \nin its general election manifestos in 1955 and 1959 manifestos promised to defend and \ndevelop grammar schools. Following the White Paper Secondary education for all (Ministry \nof Education, 1958) a major school building programme took place, albeit mainly of \nsecondary moderns. Within higher education, university colleges such as Sheffield and \nSouthampton were upgraded to university status, and even before the publication of the \nRobbins report approval was given for seven new universities, including East Anglia, \nLancaster, Warwick and York. \n \nHealth \n The NHS rapidly proved to be popular with the British public, meaning that whilst the \nConservatives may have disliked its universalist construction and its funding from general \ntaxation, and had favoured the retention of the voluntary hospitals and the encouragement of \nthe private sector, they found it difficult to attack. It was also an area where the views of the \nOne Nation Group appeared to vary, so that whilst One nation was generally supportive of \nthe NHS, in The social services Macleod and Powell called for a shift away from taxation \ntowards insurance and charging to finance the service, and The responsible society also \nargued for a shift from tax towards contributions. \n \nIn reality, there was little major change in health policy, although in June 1952 prescription \ncharges, which had been legislated for but not implemented under the Labour government, \nwere introduced, at the rate of one shilling (5p) per form, and these were followed by charges \nfor false teeth and for glasses. In addition, capital expenditure was kept under tight control \nand there was effectively a freeze on staffing. The one major piece of legislation during this \nperiod was the Mental Health Act 1959, which abolished the \u201ecertification\u201f procedure for the \ncompulsory admission of people to hospitals, and together with advances in treatment, \nreduced both the use of compulsory procedures and the incidence of long stays in psychiatric \nhospitals. By the early 1960s the poor state of much hospital provision led to pressure for \nchange and the development of the 1962 Hospital Plan, which aimed to provide modern and \ncomprehensive facilities based upon a network of district general hospitals, although this was \narguably not to be a great success (Lowe, 1993). \n \nSocial security \n \nWhile there were few major changes to social security provision under the Conservative \ngovernments of the 1950s and 1960s, there were developments that indicated the ongoing \ntensions within the Party, and which indeed reflected those within the One Nation Group\u201fs \npublications. For example, there was some increase in support within the Conservative Party \nfor greater selectivity and use of means-tested benefits, enabling Labour to refer to \u201etwo \nnations\u201f, one with earnings-related benefits, the other relying on Beveridge\u201fs flat-rate benefits \n(George, 1968). In addition, whilst there was a widespread belief at the time that social and \neconomic policies adopted in the 1940s and 1950s were having egalitarian and \nredistributional effects, Titmuss and others were producing evidence that inequalities of \nincome and wealth were instead growing, with Titmuss (1962) noting the decline of the \nprogressive tax system and the greater use of indirect taxes and suggesting that this \u201emay \nmean in the long run a gradual abandonment of the search for equity\u201f (p. 197). This, and the \n\u201erediscovery\u201f of poverty in a number of academic works in the early 1960s did lead to some \nreappraisal by the political parties of policies aimed at relieving poverty, but the \nConservatives\u201f manifestos for the 1955, 1959 and 1964 general elections almost completely \nneglected such issues and any immediate attempt to respond to these was left to the Labour \ngovernments of 1964-70. \n \nIn terms of policy, in 1952 the government reduced the level of the food subsidy, which had \nbeen in place since the war, although in the same year family allowances were increased, \nincluding to help minimise the possible impacts on nutrition, and in 1956 the allowance was \nextended to all school children. The government was, however, anxious to make economies, \nand the bread subsidy was abolished. Nevertheless, family allowances remained a contentious \narea, and were one of the areas proposed for cuts by Peter Thorneycroft in 1957, prior to his \nresignation. Indeed the differing pressures on social security during the period are evident in \nCabinet papers from the 1950s and 1960s which show concerns over recommendations for \nincreases made by the National Assistance Board, and in some cases differences of opinion \nbetween ministers responsible for pensions and national insurance, and the Chancellor of the \nExchequer who was seeking to contain increases in public expenditure. \n \nBy the mid-1950s there were concerns within both of the major parties about problems with \nthe National Insurance system and with Labour proposing a graduated but redistributive \nsystem of graduated but redistributive system the Conservatives felt pressured to respond. \nWhilst some Conservatives, such as Boyd-Carpenter and MacLeod, sought to develop a \nscheme not solely for economic efficiency but also on the basis of social justice, others, \nincluding in the Treasury, wished to see a reduction in the cost to the Exchequer of National \nInsurance (Bridgen, 2000). Eventually, the reformers, despite the initial support of \nMacmillan, lost out, and in 1959 a limited graduated pension scheme was introduced as a \n\u201etop-up\u201f to the flat rate system (Bridgen, 2000; Hill, 1983), although contributors were able to \n\u201econtract out\u201f of the state scheme and instead choose an approved tax-subsidised occupational \npension provided by insurance companies (Lowe, 1993), with an increasing number choosing \nto do so during the 1960s. \n \nThe personal social services \n \nUnder the Conservative governments Children\u201fs departments continued to develop and \nextended their activities into work designed to play a greater role in preventing child abuse \nand neglect, and the Children and Young Persons Act 1963 helped to legitimise and \nencourage such changes in emphasis. The activities of other local authority welfare services \nalso continued to develop, including responding to the need to replace the poor law \ninheritance of former workhouses and replace them with smaller, more appropriate, \naccommodation for older people and disabled people.  \n \n \nConclusions \n \nThe writings of the One Nation Group should perhaps be seen very much as artefacts of their \ntime, and as responding to the expectations and realities of post-war period, including the \nneed for economic reconstruction and the popularity of many parts of the welfare state. In \naddition, the pamphlets were written and edited by different individuals, and there was not \nalways agreement among them. Indeed, Walsha (2003) argues that the range of attitudes \namongst members of the One Nation Group has always been less uniform than has been \nwidely assumed, that the group\u201fs pamphlets, including those of the 1950s, largely \u201eoffer \nsnapshots of policies members were agreed on at sporadic junctures\u201f (p. 78) and that the \ninfluence of the group in the 1950s and 1960s might have been exaggerated by  the \nperception that any adoption of policies and practices that appeared to \u201eaccord to the aims and \nprinciples of One Nation Conservatism were frequently translated as a victory for the One \nNation Group, regardless of its actual level of involvement\u201f (p. 81). \n \nAs noted earlier in this article, in many respects there was not as much new in the One Nation \nGroup\u201fs proposals as is sometimes suggested, and arguably the greatest significance of the \nGroup, and in particular One nation, was to provide a more coherent and persuasive \nunderpinning for Conservative social policies, \u201ethe sense of a programme, where previously \nthere had been disparate policies\u201f (Walsha, 2003, p. 85). \n \nWhat is clear is that following the Conservatives election victory in 1951 they left the basic \nstructures of the welfare state unchanged. Under Butler as Chancellor from 1951 to 1956 the \nshare of GDP which went on education, health and social security remained fairly steady, at \naround eleven per cent (Glennerster, 2007). However, this was in part because the world and \nBritish economies were enjoying a post-war boom and this in turn helped distract demands \nfor more fundamental changes in public expenditure, including on social policy. Even with \nslower economic growth in the 1950s and calls from the Treasury for reductions in social \nexpenditure, the spending departments and their supporters were largely successful in \nopposing this, and under Macmillan\u201fs premiership, from 1957 to 1963, the Conservatives \nretained a largely corporatist approach to planning, a commitment to full employment, \nincomes policy and social welfare. \n \nIt is not unreasonable to conclude that from 1951 to 1964 One Nation Conservatism, and any \nconsensus, endured because of a combination of factors: firstly, many parts of the welfare \nstate were clearly popular with the public and attempts to reduce them would have held \nelectoral dangers; secondly, successive Conservative leaders \u2013 Churchill, Eden, Macmillan \nand Home \u2013 held broadly similar views of the role of government and believed that Britain \nshould be governed from the political centre; and perhaps most importantly, the policies and \napproaches of the period appeared to be delivering prosperity for the public and electoral \nsuccess for the Conservative Party. Whilst these coincided with the views of a group of more \nprogressive Conservatives, some of whom rose to ministerial positions at this time, ideas \nwhich placed much greater emphasis on individual responsibility, lower taxation and a \nsmaller role for government continued to be a significant part of Conservative thinking, and \nwere perhaps encouraged by the recurring economic crises. In 1961 Macmillan noted in his \ndiary the division in the Cabinet between the dirigistes, including himself, and those who \nfavoured liberal, laissez faire, views (Macmillan, 1973). When Macmillan resigned as Prime \nMinister on health grounds in 1963, and with the Conservative Party\u201fs defeat under Alec \nDouglas-Home at the 1964 general election, the strength of the One Nation strand within the \nParty was arguably in decline and the door open for the growing influence of New Right \nthinking. \n \n \nReferences \n \nBridgen, P.
