A project initially stimulated by mineral exploration and to assist\ngeological mapping has successfully evolved into a survey that has many environ-\nmental applications.

The geochemical mapping, originally based on the collection of\ndrainage samples, has expanded to include soils and a further suite of determinands\nin stream waters. The methodology of the project and application of the baseline data\nare described and issues common to worldwide geochemical mapping programmes\nare discussed.\nKEYWORDS: geochemical mapping, soil, stream sediment, stream water\nINTRODUCTION\nG-BASE (Geochemical Baseline Survey of the Environment) is\na long-established systematic geochemical mapping project that\nis indirectly funded by government through the UK Natural\nEnvironment Research Council (NERC) and is one of the\nBritish Geological Survey\u2019s (BGS) core science activities. When\nsampling commenced in the late 1960s the work was stimulated\nby mineral exploration and to assist geological mapping, but\nnow this high-resolution survey has many environmental appli-\ncations. Much of the renewed demand for baseline geochemical\ninformation of the surface environment is legislatively driven.\nThe geochemical mapping methods and techniques estab-\nlished by Professor Jane Plant in BGS have now been used by\nseveral generations of geochemists both in the UK and in many\nparts of the world. Through the experiences of the G-BASE\nproject, BGS continues to make significant contributions to\ninternational initiatives on geochemical mapping such as the\nrecommendations for international geochemical mapping\n(Darnley et al. 1995) and the FOREGS (Forum of European\nGeological Surveys) European geochemical baseline project\n(Plant et al. 1997; Salminen et al. 1998).\nThe use of stream sediments in geochemical mapping derives\nfrom the fact that the active sediment in a stream bed can be\nused to give an approximation of the chemical composition of\nmaterials derived from the catchment area upstream of the\nsampling site. Regional geochemical mapping using stream\nsediments grew out of developments in the use of stream\nsediment sampling for mineral prospecting (Hawkes & Bloom\n1955). The first comprehensive geochemical mapping in the\nUK was carried out by the Applied Geochemistry Research\nGroup at Imperial College London. The Wolfson Geochemical\nAtlas of England and Wales (Webb et al. 1978) remains the only\ncompleted regional geochemical stream sediment survey of\nEngland. A rapid field sampling programme carried out in the\nspace of just one year (1969) collected stream sediments from\n49 464 sites in England and Wales giving an approximate\nsampling density of one sample every 3 km2. However, this\ndensity does not account for the unsampled urban areas and\nregions of no surface drainage (e.g. over chalk).\nMcGrath & Loveland (1992) produced a soil geochemical\natlas of England and Wales. Surface soils were collected at a\ndensity of one sample per 25 km2 from non-urban areas and\ndetermined for \u2018total\u2019 (acid-extractable) and extractable concen-\ntrations of major elements, nutrients and some trace elements.\nA soil geochemical atlas of Northern Ireland has also been\ncompleted by Jordan et al. (2000) targeted at lowland agricultural\nsoils. In this, over 6000 soil samples were collected from almost\nevery kilometre square in the lowland area of Northern Ireland.\nIn 1968 the Institute of Geological Sciences (IGS) (now\nBGS) began regional geochemical sampling in the northern\nHighlands of Scotland aimed at producing maps to show the\ndistribution of trace elements in stream sediments. Prior to this,\nBGS geochemical investigations were involved mainly with\nuranium reconnaissance work, a programme supported by the\nUK Atomic Energy Authority. Systematic sampling for the\nregional geochemistry started in Caithness and Sutherland in\n1968, then Orkney and Shetland, and the work has progressed\nsouthwards from northern Scotland ever since. There was a\nclose synergy between the regional geochemical mapping\nproject and BGS\u2019s Mineral Reconnaissance Programme (MRP)\n(1972\u20131997). The MRP was a multidisciplinary programme,\nusing geochemistry for targeted mineral exploration. Initially the\nMRP was concerned with base metals but later effort focused\non strategic metals such as manganese and tungsten and on\nother commodities such as barite, gold and the platinum-group\nmetals.\nFigure 1 shows the current extent of the geochemical\nbaseline mapping with c. 80% of the British land area sampled.\nWhilst the south of England represents one-fifth of the area\nto be sampled, this region contains one-third of the country\u2019s\npopulation and has the greatest legislatively driven demand for\nbaseline geochemical data. Sampling is carried out during the\nsummer months (June\u2013September) by Earth and environmental\nsciences students during their vacation. Continuous progress\nhas been made, sampling between 2000 and 5000 sites each\nGeochemistry: Exploration, Environment, Analysis, Vol. 5 2005, pp. 347\u2013357 1467-7873\/05\/$15.00 \u0001 2005 AAG\/ Geological Society of London\nsummer; resources for the project have varied according the\nBGS\u2019s commitments to other projects. At the current rate of\nprogress the projected date of completion of the sampling\nwould be between 2015 and 2020. To date, over 105 000 stream\nsediments, 25 000 soils and 65 000 stream waters have been\ncollected (see Table 1). The urban part of the G-BASE work is\ndescribed elsewhere (Fordyce et al. 2005). Typical uses for the\nbaseline geochemical methods and data during the course of a\nyear are summarized in Table 2.\nMETHODS\nSampling\nAll G-BASE field procedures are documented in a field\nprocedures manual (Johnson et al. 2003) that is updated annually\nto ensure that minor procedural variations between sampling\ncampaigns are recorded. Stream sediment sampling methods\nhave changed little since the 1970s following the comprehensive\norientation studies of Plant (1971). The most significant change\nis the increase in different sample types collected. What started\nas a regional geochemical mapping survey based on drainage\nsediments has expanded to include soil sampling and a more\nextensive suite of water sample analyses (Simpson et al. 1993).\nA multi-media survey is more efficient in terms of sampling\ncosts and extends the uses to which the geochemical mapping\ncan be applied. The sampling methods used by G-BASE are\nsummarized Table 3.\nTwo types of site are sampled, namely a drainage site and\na soil site. Samples of stream sediment, stream water and a\npanned heavy mineral concentrate are collected from each\ndrainage site located on small streams (first or second order)\nto give a sampling density of one sample per 1.5 to 2 km2. A\ndiagrammatic representation of a sampling site plan is given in\nFigure 2. Sediments and waters are analysed for a large range of\ndeterminands (see Table 3); the panned concentrates are only\nstudied in detail or submitted for analysis if follow-up work is\nrequired. A suite of water samples is collected in a manner\nappropriate to the method by which they are to be analysed.\nFig. 1. Map showing atlas areas of Great Britain and Northern\nIreland (numbers refer to the geochemical atlas areas \u2013 see Table 1).\nAreas 1\u201317 have been sampled. Area 20 is currently being extended\nto all of Northern Ireland as part of the Department of Enterprise,\nTrade and Investment (DETI) funded Tellus Project.\nTable 1.

Two soil samples are collected at each sampling site.\nC.C. Johnson et al.348\nTwo soil samples are collected from each soil site represent-\ning surface soil (c. 5\u201320 cm) and deeper soil (c. 35\u201350 cm)\nthough in areas of shallow soil development the \u2018deeper\u2019 soil\ncan often be of equivalent depth to the surface soil. Initially, the\ndeeper soils were collected only in areas where there was no\nsurface drainage, for example in areas of chalk bedrock, to give\nbaseline information where none was available from stream\nsediments (e.g. BGS 1996). However, as G-BASE has moved\nsouthwards into lowland areas where agriculture is more\nintensive and population density is greater, the demand for soil\ngeochemical data has increased. G-BASE now routinely collects\nsoils from every second kilometre square of the British National\nGrid by random selection within each square, avoiding trans-\nport routes, domestic and public gardens, and other seriously\ndisturbed ground. In urban areas soils are sampled at a greater\ndensity, with four sample sites located within each National\nGrid kilometre square. Sample sites are located at the centre\nof 500 \u0002 500 m sub-cells within each square but the nature of\nthe urban environment generally does not allow a completely\nregular sampling grid (see Fig. 2). Urban areas are defined from\n1:50 000 scale topographic maps (Ordnance Survey\u0003 Land-\nranger maps) on which urban and industrial areas are charac-\nterized by a high density of buildings.\nChemical analyses\nAnalytical methods have changed considerably in the 35 years\nsince the project began. More elements can now be measured at\never-greater accuracy and precision and down to lower concen-\ntration levels. Initially, direct current arc optical emission\nspectroscopy (OES) was the method employed. It is a multi-\nelement technique that can be used directly on solids. In the\nearly days, before the advances in electronics and computing,\nphotographic OES was used. The intensities of the spectral\nlines from samples, captured on photographic plates, were\ncompared with spectra from standards of known concentration.\nThis technique was only practical for a small range of elements;\nat that time atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) following an\nacid extraction was a more reliable method for Cu, Pb and Zn,\nso these elements were determined by AAS. In this period,\nmineral reconnaissance was an important part of the work and\nan acid extraction gave a good indication of base metal\nmineralization.\nIn later years a direct reading (DR) spectrometer, utilizing\nphotomultipliers for detection and a computer for calibration\nand concentration calculation, was used. This more automated\nmethod allowed for more efficient determination of a greater\nnumber of elements. The determination of Cu, Pb and Zn by\nthis technique, when compared to AAS data on the same\nsamples, was appropriate for geochemical mapping at that time.\nEarly in the G-BASE project, U was determined in stream\nsediments by the delayed neutron method (DNM) of analysis,\nand in the second half of the 1970s As and Sb were added to the\nprogramme as pathfinders for hydrothermal gold mineraliza-\ntion. The latter elements were determined by AAS following an\nacid attack and solvent extraction.\nImprovements in X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRFS)\nsystems, coupled with the advances in computing, have made\nXRFS analysis a viable option for geochemical mapping, and\nsince 1990 it has been used to determine the main multi-\nelement suite together with U, As and Sb. Wavelength-\ndispersive (WD) XRFS (Ingham & Vrebos 1994) using a Philips\nPW1480 sequential spectrometer and two Philips PW2400\nsequential spectrometers is used for the determination of major\nand trace elements. The spectrometers are controlled using a\nPhilips X40 application software package. Calibrations are\nperformed using the manufacturer\u2019s calibration algorithms,\nmaking corrections for matrix effects and spectral line overlap.\nUp to two line-overlap interferences can be corrected for, using\nthe X40 software. In conjunction with the WD-XRFS, an\nenergy-dispersive (ED) XRFS (PANalytical Epsilon 5) is now\nalso used to determine the heavier elements, Ag to Ce.\nIn the early days of the project, stream water samples were\nanalysed for a restricted number of determinands. Conductivity\nand pH were measured using portable field equipment and U\nwas determined by DNM. Bicarbonate (by titration) and\nfluoride (by ion-selective electrode) were determined from the\nearly 1980s, and chloride and nitrate (by ion chromatography)\nwere added to the programme from the late 1980s. Multi-\nelement analysis by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission\nspectrometry (ICP-AES) of a larger number of water samples\nalso began in the 1980s. A Fisons\/ARL 3580 ICP-AES was\nTable 2.

Early field data and analytical results were\nhand-written and manually typed into reports and tables. The\nsystematic and standardized method of reporting field data has\nbeen achieved from the commencement of the work using field\ncards (Fig. 3) that have changed little since the 1970s. These\nwere based on 80-column computer punch cards which ensured\nall important data were recorded within fields (site geology and\nland use for example) that were compulsory to fill, usually with\ncoded information. These codes are standardized throughout\nTable 3. Table summarising G-BASE sampling and analyses procedures.\nSampling Sample preparation and analyses\nStream sediment\nSediment is collected from the active drainage channel of\nfirst or second order streams. The sediment is wet sieved\nfirstly through a 2 mm nylon screen then a 150 \u00b5m nylon\nsieve. The fine stream sediment is collected in a Kraft\uf6db\npaper bag. Sampling density varies according to land use\nand drainage pattern but averages at one sample every one\nto two square kilometre.\nSediments are dried initially by air drying, then freeze\ndrying before being pulverized in agate ball mills. Samples\nare pelletized ready for XRFS analyses at the BGS\nlaboratories in Keyworth, UK. A combination of emission\nand dispersive techniques gives a range of 48 elements (Ag,\nAl, As, Ba, Bi, Br, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Ga, Ge,\nHf, I, K, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Nd, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Sb,\nSc, Se, Si, Sm, Sn, Sr, Ta, Te, Th, Ti, Tl, U, V, W, Y, Zn\nand Zr)\nPanned concentrate\nThe \u00042 mm +150 \u00b5m fraction from the sieving of the\nsediment is panned on site in a wooden Malaysian-style\n\u2018dulang\u2019 pan. A full pan is panned down to give a\nconstant volume in the centre of the pan. The heavy\nminerals are scanned for evidence of mineralization or\npollution.\nPanned concentrates are not routinely analysed or\nexamined in detail. They are stored for future reference\nand follow-up as required.\nStream water\nFiltered (0.45 \u00b5m cellulose filter) and unfiltered waters are\ncollected from the same site as the drainage sediment.\nSamples are stored in Nalgene\uf6db bottles and acidified as\nrequired by the analytical method.\nAlkalinity (by colorimetric titration), pH and conductivity\ndetermined on location.

TIC\/TOC analyser for non-purgeable organic carbon\n(NPOC)\nSoil\nSoils are collected using a 1-m Dutch auger taking five\nsub-samples at the corners and centre of a 20 m square. A\nsurface sample (5\u201320 cm) and a deeper sample (35\u201350 cm)\nare taken at each site. Samples are collected from alternate\n1 km grid squares though in urban areas sampling density\nis increased to four samples every 1 km2. Samples are\ncollected in Kraft\uf6db paper bags\nThe deeper soil samples are dried, then sieved to \u00042 mm.\nSamples are routinely analysed only in areas where drainage\nis absent. The surface samples are dried and sieved to\n\u00042 mm and pulverized in agate ball mills then pelletized\nfor XRFS analyses as per stream sediment samples.\nLoss-on-ignition (450\u0005C) and pH are also routinely\nmeasured for surface soils.\nC.C. Johnson et al.350\nBGS and are used by other geological disciplines during\nfieldwork. The codes also tend to be hierarchical which helps\nwith selective retrieval of samples during interpretation. For\nexample, the four-letter land use code for woodland is AE00,\nwhereas for deciduous, coniferous and mixed woodland the\ncodes are AEA0, AEB0 and AEC0, respectively. All types of\nwoodland can be selected simply by using the first two letters of\nthe code.\nAs the volume of geochemical data grew, the storage\ndemands continually pushed computer hardware to its limits.\nThe project has always been at the forefront of computer-aided\nmap plotting and interpretation, though computer-generated\nmaps of the 1970s (e.g. Plant & Rhind 1974), considered\nspectacular at the time because of the \u2018cutting-edge\u2019 computer\nautomation, can now be routinely created on a desk-top\ncomputer. The basis for all data interpretation and map\nproduction is a sound quality-controlled (Plant et al. 1975) and\nassured database. On receipt from the laboratories, the\nG-BASE analytical results go through a series of data condi-\ntioning procedures. Here, data conditioning is used in the sense\nof \u2018rendering fit for purpose\u2019 and for some data applications,\nnot all the conditioning procedures are required. For example,\nlevelling the data to a national standard is required only to plot\nseamless national geochemical maps (Fig. 4) and not if studying\na small region such as a local administrative area. However,\nstandard error checking and use of control samples to monitor\nprecision and accuracy are required to be done on all data\nbefore they are loaded to the BGS Geochemistry Database.\nDuplicate, replicate, blank, primary and secondary reference\nmaterials are all included in every batch of samples submitted\nfor analysis. The chemical laboratories monitor accuracy and\nprecision by the inclusion of international (primary) reference\nmaterials before and after every batch of 500 samples. The\nFig. 2. Diagram showing a typical G-BASE sample site plan. The\ngrid represents 1-km squares and the urban region is shaded. Circles\nrepresent drainage sites (on streams) and crosses represent soil sites.\nFig. 3. Example of a G-BASE field card for stream sediment.\nG-BASE: baseline geochemical mapping 351\nproject inserts control samples that are \u2018blind\u2019 to the\nlaboratories in order to assess sampling and analytical error and\nto provide control data to level results between the annual\nsampling campaigns. The primary and secondary reference\nmaterial control samples are important for the levelling and\nnormalization procedures used by the project as described by\nDarnley et al. (1995). In G-BASE, 6% of soil and sediment and\n8% of water samples submitted for analysis are control samples,\nFig. 4. Copper in stream sediments. Image produced using ESRI ArcView GIS software.\nC.C. Johnson et al.352\nand with the large number of samples collected (Table 1) this\nprovides a very adequate control data set.\nInitially the regional geochemistry data were stored in an\nORACLE project database set up in the mid-1980s, but as\nsampling expanded to include more than drainage sediments the\ndata became difficult to manage and some data, such as those\non soils, were not being incorporated. The BGS Geochemistry\nDatabase was designed in 1992 (Coats & Harris 1995) and has\nsince been populated with a wide range of BGS geochemical\ndata, including the G-BASE results. The many ORACLE data\ntables of the database are linked by a unique sample ID keyfield\nand include laboratory batch information (date of registration,\nanalyte detection limits etc.), site information, analyte determi-\nnations, and a wide range of ancillary information (such as data\nconfidentiality, grid accuracy and code versions) that provide\nessential information to the data users. However, it is unfortu-\nnate that the staffing resources envisaged in the database design\nhave never been realized and in most instances only the site\ninformation and analytical results are routinely loaded.\nThe excess soil and sediment archive materials are an\nimportant resource for the project and have numerous applica-\ntions ranging from isotopic studies to post-graduate theses.\nCollation and storage of geochemical samples is an often-\nneglected part of geochemical surveys, yet the samples are a\nvaluable resource that needs to be available for future research.\nThe BGS hosts the UK National Geoscience Data Centre\n(NGDC) and the G-BASE samples form a small part of the\nnational geological sample archive.\nPRESENTATION OF RESULTS\nRegional geochemical data are best presented as thematically\ncoloured maps and, since the publication of the data for the\nGreat Glen atlas (BGS 1987), G-BASE has produced atlases\ncontaining coloured gridded images for each element. Earlier\natlases presented the data as single-element symbol maps where\nlines proportional to an element\u2019s concentration were used to\npresent the results (e.g. Regional Geochemical Atlas: Shetland; IGS\n1978). The atlas areas were initially based on the national\nquarter-inch geological map sheet areas. Each atlas puts the\nregional geochemistry in the context of the geology and other\navailable geoscience information such as mineral occurrences.\nIn addition to being a concise summary of a region\u2019s geology\nand mineralization, each atlas contains comprehensive infor-\nmation regarding the behaviour of each element in the temper-\nate surface environment of Great Britain with an increasing\nemphasis on the diffuse anthropogenic impacts.\nIn urban areas, soil geochemistry is reported as symbol maps\nrather than gridded images (see Fordyce et al. 2005, fig. 4). It is\ninappropriate to produce gridded images at small scales by\nextrapolating over an inhomogeneous environment, making\npoint source contamination blight unnecessarily large areas.\nBox-and-whisker plots are also used extensively to compare\ndifferent sub-sets of data (see Fordyce et al. 2005, fig. 7).\nWith the widespread use of PC GIS, map sheet boundaries\nare now obsolete and digital data are provided to meet the data\nusers\u2019 requirements. Sub-sets of G-BASE soil data are increas-\ningly requested for local government administrative boundary\nareas and stream sediment and water data are more logically\ninterpreted by river catchment areas.\nIn addition to presenting results in a series of geochemical\natlases, G-BASE samples and data are utilized in a wide range\nof applications and reported in peer-reviewed publications.\nRecent publications have shown how regional geochemical data\ncan be used to interpret subtle geological changes (Stone et al.\n2003); to demonstrate the relationships between soils, heavy\nmetal pollution and parent material (Breward 2003; Rawlins\net al. 2002a; 2003); in archaeology (Chenery et al. 2001); and in\nsurface water research (Hutchins et al. 1999). The project has\nalso made significant contributions to documents prepared by\nBGS for government bodies in response to legislation and\ndirectives in connection with pollution and contamination (e.g.\nAnder 2004; Smith et al. 2002).\nDISCUSSION\nAdapting to the increasing applications of regional\ngeochemical mapping\nThe G-BASE geochemical mapping project is a long-\nestablished and systematic survey, the results of which have\nshown, and continue to show, that the methodology success-\nfully defines the geochemical baseline to a high degree of\nresolution and produces data with a wide range of applications.\nThe project has demonstrated its ability to adapt to the\nchanging needs of the user community by switching from\nprincipally mineral exploration to environmental applications.\nNevertheless, demand for regional geochemical data to help\nlocate mineralization continues, albeit periodically, and results\nwill continue to have applicability in this field in ways that we\ncannot envisage at present. For example, G-BASE drainage\nsediment data are of great value in connection with current gold\nexploration in the Sperrin Mountains of Northern Ireland\nand have recently also been used in prospectivity mapping in\nNW Scotland (Colman et al. 2003). Since the end of the BGS\nMineral Reconnaissance Programme, responsibility for follow-\ning up regional geochemical data now rests with exploration\ncompanies who continue to license and exploit the data in\ncommercial confidence.\nThe sampling methodology has changed little and remains a\ncost-effective method of geochemical mapping. It is a method-\nology that has been applied to many countries around the\nworld, often with minor modifications to suit the local climatic\nzone. For example, regional geochemical mapping in the\nAnti-Atlas region of Morocco (Johnson et al. 2001), following\nan essential orientation exercise, determined that the 250 \u00b5m\nfraction of the stream sediment from the semi-arid environment\nwas the most suitable fraction for giving the best contrast\nbetween background and anomalies (BGS 1999). This is coarser\nthan the sediment fraction used in the temperate climate of\nGreat Britain but shows the adaptability of the sampling\nmethodology.\nThe use of graduate students to do the sampling is an\nimportant part of the sampling strategy. Since the project\nstarted it is estimated that nearly 1000 students have benefited\nfrom the experience of collecting geochemical samples with\nG-BASE during the summer field campaign. Universities do\nnot have the resources to provide such practical training and\nstudents find the work experience valuable. Many of the G-\nBASE samplers have gone on to pursue careers in geochemistry\nor environmental science.\nThe demand for geochemical baseline data is increasingly\nbeing driven by legislation. Table 4 summarizes this legislation,\nwhich is increasingly being directed by the European Commis-\nsion. Those empowered to apply or enforce the legislation are\ngenerally administrators, not geochemists, and they will want\nvalue-added data that show risks and probabilities of element\ndistributions in the context of guideline values. We must be\ncontinually adapting what we produce to meet the users\u2019 needs.\nAlthough sampling methods have changed little, there is still\nscope for introducing new technologies into the project.\nHand-held global positioning systems (GPS) were introduced in\n2001 following the successful use of GPS during the Morocco\nG-BASE: baseline geochemical mapping 353\ngeochemical survey. Laptop computers have been used since\nthe mid-1990s for entering field card information into a field\ndatabase whilst on location. Current initiatives are looking at\ninputting site information directly into palm-sized computers\nand bar-coding sample bags to make sample checking and\ncollation easier and error-free. However, the geochemical\nsampling method is characterized by its relative simplicity and\nlow capital expense. This is particularly important when trans-\nferring appropriate technology to developing countries. Any\nimprovements to the sampling methodology, particularly those\nthat rely on increasingly complex and expensive equipment, will\nonly be incorporated provided they have a sound cost-benefit\nanalysis and a proven reliability.\nLongevity of survey and sampling density\nBGS has not completed the geochemical mapping of Great\nBritain in more than 35 years of sampling, and the impact of\nchanging hardware and software used for the chemical and data\nanalyses makes it difficult to maintain a consistency of products.\nStrict quality control procedures have maintained a consistency\nin the data, but the requirements of the user community have\nchanged with time and a government-funded project is subject\nto prevailing political whims. G-BASE methodology has been\napplied by BGS to other long-term surveys (e.g. Sumatra,\nIndonesia, 1975\u20131994; Machali et al. 1997) as well as more rapid\nregional mapping surveys sampling at rates five to ten times the\ncurrent G-BASE rate (e.g. Morocco; Johnson et al. 2001).\nAlthough G-BASE is tied to the summer vacation months by its\nuse of student samplers, it would be desirable to send out more\nsampling teams during this period so as to complete the survey\nas quickly as possible. This makes more efficient use of current\nsoftware and hardware without the need for constant retraining\n\u2013 it is simply more cost-efficient to complete the survey as\nrapidly as possible.\nThe speed of geochemical mapping is always a contentious\nissue between government-funded surveys and the customers\nwho use the data. For example, exploration companies con-\nducting regional surveys will often produce results in a matter of\nweeks and find it hard to comprehend the slowness of national\nsurveys. Projects such as G-BASE operate on a long-term\nstrategy that meets the needs of a wide variety of applications by\nproducing a systematic and highly controlled database of\ngeochemical results that will be an asset to the nation and in use\nfor many generations.\nThe relatively high density of sampling for this multi-media\nregional survey is responsible for the longevity of the project in\ntwo respects. Firstly, there is the obvious need to collect and\nTable 4. Summary of some UK legislation and European Commission (EC) Directives driving the demand for G-BASE baseline geochemical data.\nLegislation\/Directive Summary Application of baseline geochemical data\nEnvironmental Protection Act (1990) Part IIa This defines contaminated land (Part IIA, Section\n78A(2)) and provides a framework for the\nidentification and remediation of such land.\nLocal authorities have the responsibility to identify\nand remediate contaminated land commencing with\na strategy plan. Baseline geochemical data,\nparticularly soil data for urban areas, can be used as\npart of the strategy to identify contaminated areas.\nEC Water Framework Directive (WFD)\n(2000\/60\/EC)\nThis requires member states to meet a good\necological status for water quality objectives\n(except where deviations from the standard are\njustified), and to identify basic and supplementary\nmeasures to deal with point source and diffuse\npollution. The directive will be managed on the\nbasis of River Basin Districts (one or more\ndrainage catchments).\nBaseline geochemical data for low-order streams\ncan provide information about surface water quality\nfor farmers and those who manage land. Regulatory\nbodies and administrators can use the data to\ndetermine guideline levels for elemental\nconcentrations.\nPollution Prevention Control Act (1999) (PPC) This replaces legislation concerned with Integrated\nPollution Control (IPC) (derived from the\nEnvironmental Protection Act (1990) Part 1) and\nLocal Air Pollution Control (LAPC). It has been\ncreated to implement the EC Integrated Pollution\nPrevention and Control Directive (96\/61\/EC). Its\nobjective is to control pollution from industry.\nBaseline geochemical data can be used both by\nindustry and regulators to assess the impact of\npolluting industries on the environment. The\nbaseline data provides a reference point against\nwhich changes can be measured.\nEC Sewage Sludge Directive (86\/278\/EEC) This directive seeks to encourage the use of\nsewage sludge in agriculture but regulates its use in\norder to protect the environment from its harmful\neffects.\nBaseline geochemical data can be used to monitor\nand model the impact on the environment of\nsewage sludge.\nProposed EC Soil Directive Directive currently being drafted. The European\nUnion included in the sixth Environmental Action\nProgramme an outline for a future thematic\nstrategy on soil protection leading to a European\nsoil protection policy.\nG-BASE has an extensive sample archive and\ndatabase on the geochemistry of soils collected at a\nhigh sampling density. BGS is the only UK\norganization systematically sampling soil from\nurban areas.\nProposed EC Mine Waste Directive This proposed directive is seen as a supplementary\nmeasure to the WFD to minimize the adverse\neffects on the environment caused by waste from\nthe extractive industries.\nBaseline geochemical data can be used to monitor\nand model the impact on the environment of mine\nwaste.\nEC Habitats Directive (92\/43\/EEC) This directive is concerned with the conservation\nof natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora.\nClimatic or anthropogenic changes to the\ngeochemistry of the surface environment that may\nimpact on fauna and flora can be monitored using\nbaseline geochemical data of the surface\nenvironment.\nEC Landfill Directive (1999\/31\/EC) The Landfill (England and Wales) Regulations of\n2002 implement the EC Landfill Directive which\naims to prevent or reduce the negative\nenvironmental effects of landfill.\nBaseline geochemical data can be used to monitor\nand model the impact on the environment of\nlandfill.\nC.C. Johnson et al.354\nanalyse a larger number of samples requiring more time and\nbudget. The prolonged period of sampling helps to maintain\nskills and experience amongst BGS staff and enables invest-\nments in infra-structure, such as laboratories, that will have\na long-term benefit to the organization. Secondly, use of\nG-BASE data, particularly in the more recent environmental\napplications such as identification of heavy metals in garden\nallotment areas (e.g. Hough et al. 2004; Breward 2003), demon-\nstrates how the survey\u2019s data can lead almost directly to\nsite-specific follow-up. The high density of sampling has\nenabled G-BASE to more readily adapt to the changing needs\nfor baseline geochemical data, thus ensuring continued support\nfor the project. A higher density of sampling captures more of\nthe variation in the geochemical baseline and better enables us\nto attribute the reasons for it. As a relatively small island, Britain\nhas a very diverse geological history and from an environmental\nperspective a high population density, two factors that lead to\nsignificant variation of the geochemical baseline over small\nareas.\nThe sampling density chosen for a regional geochemical\nsurvey is always ultimately decided by the time and budget that\nis available to do it. G-BASE has applied its sampling method-\nologies, both low and high density, to many regional surveys\naround the world. The relatively lower density stream sediment\nsurveys such as that in Bolivia (one per 16 km2; Appleton &\nLlanos 1985) and Sumatra, Indonesia (one per 15 km2; Machali\net al. 1997) have demonstrated the usefulness of low density\ngeochemical mapping, particularly in mineral exploration and in\nelucidating problems of regional geology. G-BASE data have\nbeen used to simulate variable sampling density (Fordyce et al.\n1993) in order to demonstrate how low sample density can be\nutilized for global geochemical mapping.\nMethod of chemical analysis and elements determined\nThe range of analytes determined, the sampling media used and\nthe density of sampling for a regional geochemical survey are\nalways a compromise between the available resources and the\ndemands of the data users. In the early days of the survey,\nexploration companies were demanding a greater range of\nelements specific to locating mineralization such as Au and Pt.\nNow the environmental users of the data want baseline data on\ncontaminants such as Hg and hazardous organic compounds\nthat are not routinely done by the project because of cost. It is\nestimated that each site costs \u00a330 (=US$ 55 or Euro 45 at\nAugust 2004 exchange rates) to sample, for a drainage site that\nwould be \u00a310 for each of the sediment, water and panned\nconcentrate, and at a soil site \u00a315 each for the surface and\ndeeper soils. Sample preparation and analysis add a further \u00a350\nto \u00a360 to the cost per sample. Additional analyses can be\nafforded only with extra budget, and this is best achieved by\nasking the organizations and agencies requiring the additional\nanalyses to contribute to the costs. Excess sample material can\nbe made available, usually as a sub-set at a reduced sample\ndensity or targeted at specific areas. However, many of the\nadditional determinands required will involve modification to\nthe sampling procedures with more time being spent at each\nsite, and that will also raise the cost of sampling. It has been\nsuggested that the soil samples could be collected adjacent to\nthe drainage site, effectively reducing the number of sites to be\nvisited by as much as 50%. Although this would be an effective\nway of reducing costs, it is not considered appropriate to\ncombine the soil and drainage surveys into the same sampling\ngrid. Collecting soil samples adjacent to drainage sites will lead\nto a soil survey that is almost exclusively based on soils derived\nfrom alluvial material.\nThe issue of analytical method, whether total or partial, is a\nsubject of much discussion when the G-BASE project is\ninvolved in the design of geochemical surveys around the world.\nA true geochemical baseline is one that shows the total\nconcentration of a determinand in the environment and for this\nreason our preference is to use analytical methods that give total\nanalyses for a wide range of elements. G-BASE\u2019s main analytical\ntechnique for solids is XRFS, and with the advent of ED XRFS,\na large range of elements with good detection limits can be\ndetermined on a single sample. Although analytical methods\nsuch as ICP-MS following a strong acid extraction are cheaper\nthan XRFS, these do not give a truly and consistently total\ndetermination for all elements, especially those in minerals\nresistant to acid attack. Legislative guidelines for element\nconcentrations cannot be based on partial extraction methods,\notherwise they will need to be cited for a great variety of\ndifferent mineral assemblages.\nWhilst it is important to define regional geochemical base-\nlines on the basis of total analyses, partial and sequential\nextraction techniques are very valuable in more detailed studies\nand follow-up work, both in exploration and environmental\napplications. The bioaccessible fraction of essential and toxic\ntrace elements, for example, is of great importance in geochem-\nistry and health, and it is recommended that this fraction can be\ndetermined for selected areas using the sample archive. There\nare several areas of Britain where the arsenic baseline in soils\nconsiderably exceeds the soil guideline value of 20 mg\/kg\n(Rawlins et al. 2002b). However, a site-specific assessment of the\nrisks of high arsenic needs to be based not on the total arsenic\nconcentration but on the amount of the bioaccessible arsenic,\nwhich can be determined using an extraction that mimics the\nconditions in the human gastro-intestinal tract (Ruby et al.\n1996).\nData conditioning and geochemistry databases\nThe G-BASE data conditioning, or rendering of the data fit for\nuse, has been introduced earlier in the discussion. The collection\nof samples over several decades represents a huge input of\neffort and resources. Managing to keep the resulting data\ncompatible across an equally long period of evolving analytical\nmethodology has also required substantial effort in data man-\nagement. A strict and well-documented regime of error check-\ning, quality control, quality assurance and standardization is\nrequired.\nHowever, even with good protocols in place, compatibility\nproblems with data will still arise, particularly those resulting\nfrom changing analytical methodology. For those elements\nwhere analytical precision is poor and concentrations are\ngenerally at or below the analytical detection limit (e.g. for\nG-BASE stream sediments and soils these would be Ag, Cd,\nMo, Sb and U), the production of seamless geochemical maps\nis difficult. Our experience has shown that the detection limit\nvalues (d.l.v.) cited by analysts tend to be on the conservative\nside and results reported below the d.l.v. can define meaningful\nand real rather than random trends. The values are worth\nretaining in the geochemistry database and such results should\nbe flagged with a qualifier field as having a \u2018below detection\nissue\u2019. For a few elements, reporting limit values were once not\nas low as those reported now and as a result different sub-sets\nof data have a varying degree of resolution at low concen-\ntrations. As a consequence, combining data-sets from different\ngenerations of analytical instrumentation will give rise to maps\nwhere the most significant boundaries recognized are due to\nanalytical artefacts. In such instances the only way to combine\ndifferent data-sets to give a seamless geochemical image is to\nG-BASE: baseline geochemical mapping 355\nsubstantially reduce the data\u2019s resolution at lower concen-\ntrations.\nThe geochemistry database underpins many of the applica-\ntions to which the geochemical results are applied. A robustly\ndesigned geochemical survey data model is essential and map-\nping programmes must give sufficient resources not only to the\ndesign of the database but also to its maintenance and manage-\nment. The Geological Survey of Canada, like the BGS, has\namassed a large quantity of geochemical data and has a\ncomprehensive relational database model that is universally\napplicable (Adcock et al. 2003).\nFuture developments\nThe demand for geochemical data is increasingly being driven\nby environmental legislation. In Europe, the European Com-\nmission has launched a number of directives (see Table 4) that\nhave required national governments to apply legislation to clean\nup and protect the environment from elements and substances\nthat are harmful to the health of the biosphere. Strategies are\nbeing developed to apply such legislation and a good national\ncoverage of baseline geochemical data is required. G-BASE\nneeds to accelerate its sampling rate to finish the remaining 20%\nof Great Britain to satisfy the demand for real rather than\nhypothetical data. The as yet unsampled part of southern Britain\nis where one-third of the country\u2019s population lives and is\nsubject to the greatest pressures associated with sustainable\ndevelopment.\nThe collection of geochemical samples is a cost-effective way\nof mapping and it is the one activity of regional geochemical\nmapping that has changed little in 40 years. Whilst new\ntechnologies such as palm-held computers for site information\ncan make the process more efficient, changes need to have a\ndemonstrable cost benefit and proven reliability.\nAdditional elements and determinands that are more rel-\nevant to environment and health issues need to be added to\nthe geochemical baseline (e.g. Hg, Se, I and toxic organic\ncompounds). Developments in analytical methodology (e.g.\nuse of ED-XRFS for soils and sediments) now make the\nroutine analysis of elements such as Se and I more feasible.\nSome of these elements and compounds would require\nchanges to the sampling methodology, particularly the sam-\npling for organic compounds, and would change the nature\nof what until now had been an inorganic geochemical survey.\nSuch changes will require a substantial increase in resources\nthat can best be achieved with greater cooperation with\nagencies and organizations specifically interested in the ad-\nditional determinands.\nRegional geochemical surveys are systematic and do not\ntarget specific areas or sites. However, the areas by which the\ndata are \u2018packaged\u2019 can be made more appropriate for the main\nusers of the results. From 2005 onwards, G-BASE will adopt a\ndrainage catchment approach to sampling rather than an atlas\nmap sheet approach. It is more logical that a geochemical survey\nbased on drainage samples produces results for drainage\ncatchment areas that correspond with those of regulatory\nagencies such as the UK environmental agencies. In urban\nareas, it is essential to be aware of local issues to which the\ngeochemical mapping can be applied, such as contaminated\ngarden allotments. With the cooperation and support of the\nlocal authorities the soil survey can be supplemented with more\ntargeted sites that will add great value to the geochemical\nsurvey.\nThe geochemistry database should no longer be seen as a\n\u2018flat\u2019 table of columns representing elements and grid references\nand rows representing samples. It should be a relational\ndatabase with many data tables linked by a unique sample\nidentifier. The data tables should contain additional information\nthat allows the users to understand the data limitations and\nwhether or not the results are fit for the purpose for which they\nare being applied. Such additional information is needed to\ndescribe the precision, accuracy and limits of detection of\ndeterminands. The BGS Geochemistry Database has been\ndesigned to hold this additional information and much of this\nstill needs to be populated for the samples collected. Once the\ndatabase has sufficient additional information a \u2018data ware-\nhouse\u2019 can be set up, accessible to the users of the baseline data\nand in the most suitable format for that user.\nDeveloping information technologies, particularly web-based\napplications, are needed to deliver the data to users. As the data\nare increasingly being used by non-geochemists, they need to be\npackaged as \u2018value-added data\u2019 in a manner usable by adminis-\ntrators, who might want to know only whether an element is\nhigh, moderate or low in relation to guideline values stipulated\nin legislation and directives.\nThis paper is published with the permission of the Director of the\nBritish Geological Survey (NERC). The authors acknowledge the\neffort of several generations of geochemists and students who have\nworked for BGS on the G-BASE project who have ensured that\nwe have inherited a well-founded regional geochemical mapping\nsurvey.\nREFERENCES\nADCOCK, S.W., GRUNSKY, E., LAFRAMBOISE, R. & SPIRITO, W.A. 2003.
