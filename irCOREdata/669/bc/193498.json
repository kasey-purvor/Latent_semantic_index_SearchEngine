Here, we report that ascending axon synapses are selectively resistant to cerebellar long-term depression and that they release\ntransmitterwithhighermean release probabilities andmeanquantal amplitudes thanparallel fiber synapses. This novel specializationof\nsynapses formed by different segments of the same axon not only explains the reported patterns of granule cell3Purkinje cell transmis-\nsion across the cerebellar cortex but also reveals an additional level of functionality and complexity of cerebellar processing. Conse-\nquently, ascending axon synapses represent a new element of cortical signal processing that should be distinguished from parallel fiber\nsynapses in future experimental and theoretical studies of cerebellar function.\nKey words: cerebellum; long-term depression; synaptic; transmission; granule cell; Purkinje cell\nIntroduction\nCerebellar granule cells (GCs) relay afferent, excitatory informa-\ntion frommossy fibers to Purkinje cells (PCs). The axons of GCs\nascend into the molecular layer (ML), where they bifurcate to\nform parallel fibers. These extend laterally for several millimeters\nin either direction, forming one or two synapses with individual\nPCs, but eachmaking contactwith up to thousands of cells as they\ncross the cerebellar cortex (Mugnaini, 1983; Napper and Harvey,\n1988; Harvey and Napper, 1991; Shepherd et al., 2002). This\nanatomical framework, enabling the divergence of afferentmossy\nfiber information along beams of fibers across the cerebellar cor-\ntex, underpins classical theories for the operation of the cerebel-\nlum (Marr, 1969; Albus, 1971). However, although direct activa-\ntion of theML can generate activity along beams of parallel fibers\nfor several millimeters (Vranesic et al., 1994), it may not reliably\ntransmit that information to PCs along the whole length of the\nparallel fiber (Garwicz and Andersson, 1992). Recent evidence\nsuggests that up to 85% of parallel fiber synapses to PCs do not\ngenerate detectable, excitatory postsynaptic responses (Isope and\nBarbour, 2002).Moreover, stimulation of the periphery ormossy\nfibers generates only spatially restricted patches of activity above\nthe mossy fiber termination zone (Eccles et al., 1972; Bower and\nWoolston, 1983; Kolb et al., 1997; Cohen and Yarom, 1998), with\nlittle evidence of synchronized firing between PCs with shared\nparallel fiber input (Jaeger, 2003). These observations have revi-\ntalized speculation that synapses formed by the ascending seg-\nment of the axon carry a greater synaptic weight than those\nformed by parallel fibers and hence play a functionally different\nrole in cerebellar signal processing (Llinas, 1982).\nUp to 20% of all GC synapses to PCs are formed by the as-\ncending segment of the axon (Gundappa-Sulur et al., 1999). As-\ncending axon synapses have a significantly higher density of ves-\nicles in their presynaptic termini than those made by parallel\nfibers (Gundappa-Sulur et al., 1999), perhaps suggesting a greater\nprobability of transmitter release (Murthy et al., 1997; Schikorski\nand Stevens, 2001) (but see Xu-Friedman et al., 2001). The\npostsynaptic density length of parallel fiber synapses diminishes\nwith distance from the GC soma (Pichitpornchai et al., 1994),\nand a high variability of glutamate receptor subunit 2 labeling,\nthe predominant AMPA receptor subunit at GC3PC synapses,\nhas been reported (Zhao et al., 1997). This may indicate a parallel\npostsynaptic heterogeneity between synapse types.\nTo date, ascending axon connections have been mostly over-\nlooked in current models of cerebellar cortical processing. Here,\nwe report that there are indeed discernible presynaptic and\nReceived Sept. 8, 2004; revised Feb. 4, 2005; accepted Feb. 4, 2005.\nThis work was supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and the Royal Society.\nWe thank Ian Martin for his support and advice and Angus Silver, Erik De Schutter, and Alex Thomson for useful\ncomments and suggestions.\nCorrespondence should be addressed to Dr. N.

This differential sus-\nceptibility to changes in synaptic strength at different sections of\nthe GC axon provides a mechanism for synaptic specialization,\nwhich allows different sections of the same axon to convey differ-\nent types of information and hence serve different functions.\nMaterials andMethods\nPreparation of slices. Coronal cerebellar slices\n(250 \u0001m thick) were prepared from the vermis\nof 14- to 21-d-old male Wistar rats using a cut-\nting solution containing the following (in mM):\n250 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO3, 10 glucose,\n1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 CaCl2\u00012 H2O, and 1\nMgCl2\u00016 H2O, equilibrated with 95% O2\/5%\nCO2, pH 7.4. Slices were incubated at room\ntemperature in an artificial CSF (aCSF) com-\nposed of the following (in mM): 120 NaCl, 2.7\nKCl, 2.5 CaCl2\u00012 H2O, 25 NaHCO3, 1.2\nNaHPO4, 1.2 MgSO4\u00017 H2O, and 11 glucose,\nequilibrated with 95% O2\/5% CO2, pH 7.4.\nPicrotoxin (Sigma, Poole, UK) was added to\nthe aCSF at a concentration of 20 \u0001M to block\ninhibitory transmission via GABAA\nreceptors.\nElectrophysiology. Slices were held between\nnylon nets in an experimental chamber on an\nuprightmicroscope andperfusedwith aCSF at a\nflow rate of 2 ml\/min. Whole-cell patch-clamp\nrecordings were made at room temperature\nfrom the somata of PCs 20\u2013100 \u0001M below the\nsurfaceof the slice.For recording,patchelectrodes\n(3\u20135 M\u0001) were filled with solutions containing\nthe following (inmM): 132K-gluconate, 8NaCl, 2\nMgCl2\u00016 H2O, 30 HEPES, 4 Na2ATP, 0.3\nNa3GTP, 10 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-\nN,N,N\u0002,N\u0002-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), adjusted to\npH 7.3. These levels of BAPTAwere used tomin-\nimize influences of short- and long-term,\ncalcium-dependentmechanisms of synaptic plas-\nticity originating in the postsynaptic cell. At least\n15 min were allowed to elapse after entering\nwhole-cellmodebefore the start of data collection\nto enable sufficient diffusion of BAPTA. In a few\nexperiments, a cesium-based internal solution\nwas used of the following composition (in mM):\n140 CsMeSO3, 2 MgCl2\u00016 H2O, 24 HEPES, 4\nNa2ATP, 0.3 Na3GTP, 0.5 EGTA, and 5\n5-N-(2,6-dimethyl-phenylcarbamoylmethyl)-tri-\nethylammonium bromide (QX314), adjusted to\npH 7.3 with CsOH.\nIn a coronal orientation, the characteristic\nT-shaped structure of GC axons is preserved,\nallowing a relatively selective activation of syn-\napses formed by ascending axon segments and\nby parallel fibers onto PCs (see Fig. 1a). To\nstimulate ascending axon synapses, an aCSF-\nfilled patch electrode was placed in the slice in\nthe granule cell layer (GCL), 30\u2013100 \u0001m di-\nrectly behind the PC soma. Because parallel fi-\nbers make on average only one or at most two\nsynapses with a single PC (Harvey and Napper,\n1991), then in this configuration, the likelihood\nof activating parallel fiber synapses is small. Al-\nthough unlikely, we cannot rule out, however, a\npotential contribution from synapses formed by the parallel fiber very\nclose to the point of bifurcation.\nTo activate synapses formed by parallel fiber segments of GC axons, a\nsecond electrode was inserted midway between the PC layer and pia\nmater to a depth of 50\u2013100\u0001m, 150\u2013300\u0001m lateral to the recorded PC.\nAscending axon and parallel fiber pathways were activated alternately at\nrates of 0.1 or 0.2 Hz. Unless stated otherwise, pairs of stimuli were\napplied at intervals of 50 ms at intensities that produced EPSCs with\namplitudes of \u0003100 pA in the standard aCSF containing 2.5 mM Ca2\u0004.\nFigure 1.

In d, representative\nresults for a cell filled with a cesium-based solution are illustrated.\nSims and Hartell \u2022 Functional Differences between Granule Cell3Purkinje Cell Synapses J. Neurosci., March 23, 2005 \u2022 25(12):3246\u20133257 \u2022 3247\nTo compare the properties of synaptic re-\nsponses at different levels within theML, EPSCs\nwere characterized according to stimulating\npositions within a 200 \u0001m strip traversing the\ndepth of the ML, starting 50 \u0001m from the PC\nlayer. This was to ensure that beams of parallel\nfibers were activated and not GCs. In some\ncases, stimulating electrodes were placed 150\u2013\n300\u0001m lateral to the recorded PCbut in theGC\nlayer. In this position, parallel fiber synapses are\nactivated anterogradely, thereby eliminating\nany possibility of retrograde contamination\nfrom ascending axon synapses.\nRecordings were made with an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments,\nUnion City, CA) amplifier; signals were filtered at 5 kHz (eight-pole\nBessel filter), digitized at 10 kHz, and stored on a computer using \u201cthe\nLTP program\u201d (Anderson and Collingridge, 2001). EPSC amplitudes\nand cell input resistances were analyzed on-line. For LTD induction, an\nintracellular solution containing 0.5mMBAPTAwas used, and ascending\naxon and parallel fiber pathwayswere activated alternately at 0.2Hz for at\nleast 10 min, until a stable baseline was established. One of the pathways\nwas then stimulated five times at 100 Hz, followed 100 ms later by stim-\nulation of the climbing fiber (CF) input. This protocol was repeated 50\ntimes at 2 s intervals. Stimulationwas then resumed at baseline rates. The\nmeans of six consecutive sweeps per pathway were calculated every 30 s,\nand data are expressed as percentages of mean baseline levels. In all\nexperiments, series resistances (5\u201320 M\u0001) were compensated (\u000580%)\nand monitored throughout, and experiments were terminated if series\nresistance, input resistance, or holding current changed significantly\nduring the experiment. Off-line analysis was performed using Igor Pro\nsoftware (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). EPSC rise and decay times\nwere assessed from the time constants of single exponential curves fitted\nto each phase (\u0002rise and \u0002decay).\nAnalysis.The variance and size of paired-pulse ratios (PPRs) were high\nat very low stimulus intensities in both pathways. It has been shown\nrecently that calculating the PPR as themean of individual PPRs is biased\nin favor of high values because of random fluctuations in response size\n(Kim andAlger, 2001). Overestimation of actual PPR ismore likely when\nthe response size is small and response variance is high. Therefore, to\nreduce this biasing effect at low stimulus intensities, PPRswere calculated\nfrom the ratio of the mean of the second pulses and the mean of the first\npulses of at least 10 separate sweeps (Kim and Alger, 2001).\nFor variance-mean analysis of ascending axon and parallel fiber path-\nway responses, 50\u2013100 sweeps per pathway were collected alternately at\n0.1 Hz in the standard aCSF and then in solutions containing the follow-\ning (in mM): 5 CaCl2, 5 CaCl2 plus the A1 adenosine antagonist 1,3-\ndipropyl-8-phenylxanthine (DPPX; 100\u2013500 nM), and 1.25 CaCl2. Mag-\nnesium levels were adjusted to maintain equivalent divalent ion\nconcentrations. DPPX was used to enhance release probability, because\nmodulation of A1 receptors has been shown to primarily alter calcium\ninflux at parallel fiber3PC synapses rather than threshold (Dittman and\nRegehr, 1996). Pairs of stimuli (50 ms separation) were applied per\nsweep, and datawere only included in the analysis once the responses had\nstabilized between solution changes. Variance-mean analysis was then\nperformed on data collected from individual cells according to published\nmethods (Clements and Silver, 2000). Values for the mean quantal am-\nplitudes (Q), the minimum number of contributing release sites (Nmin),\nand the average probabilities of release (P) for each pathway were then\ncalculated for each cell, and the mean values were calculated.\nA simplified method of variance analysis was used to assess whether\nlong-term changes in synaptic strength at ML or GCL pathways were\nattributable to changes in Q, P, or the number of contributing release\nsites (N). The mean amplitude and the reciprocal of the square of the\ncoefficient of variation (CV\u00062) of 100\u2013200 individual responses, sam-\npled during a period of stable baseline recording conditions, were calcu-\nlated. A second set of values was obtained from a stable recording period\n25\u201340min after pairing one of the pathways with CF stimulation or after\ncontrol stimulus conditions. The ratios of the second to the first values\nwere calculated to obtain a value relative to baseline conditions, and\nnormalized values of CV\u00062 were plotted against normalized amplitude.\nThe mean amplitude of the EPSCs represents the product ofN, P, andQ\n(NPQ). CV\u00062 is proportional to NP\/1 \u0006 P. Therefore, a change in Q is\nindependent of CV\u00062, whereas a change in N will be directly propor-\ntional to amplitude and CV\u00062. Unless stated otherwise, all compounds\nwere obtained from Sigma.\nResults\nProperties of parallel fiber and ascending axon synapses\nto PCs\nWhole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from identi-\nfied PCs in cerebellar slices cut in a coronal plane. Patch elec-\ntrodes filled with extracellular solution were placed in the GCL\ndirectly below the soma of the PC to activate synapses supplied by\nascending segments of the GC axon or 150\u2013300 \u0001m laterally in\nthe ML to activate parallel fibers (for details, see Materials and\nMethods) (Fig. 1). Initially, pairs of stimuli were applied to each\ninput alternately, and EPSC rise and decay times and the levels of\npaired-pulse facilitation (PPF) were examined to identify possi-\nble differences in synaptic transmission properties between these\ninput pathways. The results of these experiments are summarized\nin Table 1 and Figure 1. No consistent or significant difference in\nFigure 2.

The single-exponential rise time con-\nstants of responses to parallel fiber path-\nway stimulation were, in contrast, signifi-\ncantly longer than those to ascending axon\npathway stimulation (parallel fiber, 2.02 \u0007\n0.11 ms; ascending axon, 1.63 \u0007 0.08 ms;\np\b0.05; Student\u2019s t test; two-tailed;n\t12),\nas were the respective time to peak ampli-\ntudes (3.6\u0007 0.20 and 2.94\u0007 0.14ms).\nParallel fibers tend to form synapses\nwith larger dendrites, on average, than as-\ncending axons (Gundappa-Sulur et al.,\n1999). Counterintuitively, given the dis-\ntinctive branching pattern of PC den-\ndrites, larger dendrites tend to be located\nfarther away from the PC soma\n(Gundappa-Sulur et al., 1999). We there-\nfore undertook experiments to find out\nwhether greater electrotonic filtering at\nmore distant parallel fiber synaptic re-\nsponses could account for their compara-\ntively slower rise times. Experiments were\nrepeated using cesium-based internal\npatch solutions containing QX314, and\nthe rise and decay times of parallel fiber\nand ascending axon EPSCs were exam-\nined. These experimental conditions\nshould improve the quality of the voltage\nclamp and so emphasize any differences\nattributable to differential filtering. The\nresults of these experiments are also shown\nin Table 1 and Figure 1. In keeping with a\nbetter space clamp, both parallel fiber and\nascending axon EPSC decay time con-\nstants were shorter but not statistically dif-\nferent from each other. Cesiumhad no sig-\nnificant effect on EPSC rise times\ncompared with our gluconate-based solu-\ntion, suggesting that the difference in rise\ntimes between pathways was unlikely to be\ncaused by differential filtering.\nWe next examined whether the posi-\ntion of the parallel fiber stimulating elec-\ntrode within the ML and hence the level at\nwhich the synapses were formed on the PC\naffected parallel fiber EPSC properties. Be-\ncause the parallel fibers run parallel to the\nPC layer, this should activate synapses to\nthe PC at the same level in the ML. Elec-\ntrodes were placed in the ML, 150\u2013300\n\u0001m lateral to the recorded PC cell body in\na band 50\u2013200 m from the PC layer. As\npredicted previously from modeling data\n(Roth and Ha\u00a8usser, 2001), no correlation\nbetween stimulus position and decay time\nconstants was observed (Fig. 2a). EPSC\nrise times were, however, significantly\nslower in more superficial regions of the\nML (Fig. 2b) ( p\b 0.001; Pearson\u2019s corre-\nlation). Parallel fibers have different con-\nFigure 3.

Data were collated from a total of five ML pathway inputs to three different cells.\nSims and Hartell \u2022 Functional Differences between Granule Cell3Purkinje Cell Synapses J.

We supposed that if ML stim-\nulation recruited a relatively broad beam of parallel fibers with a\nspread of different conduction velocities, this may lead to a less\nsynchronized activation of the PC, resulting in a slower onset of\nthe population EPSC. Indeed, the latencies from stimulus artifact\nto EPSC onset increased from deep to superficial regions of the\nML, consistent with the presence of finer parallel fiber axons (Fox\nand Barnard, 1957) with slower conduction velocities (Axelrad\nand Korn, 1982; Vranesic et al., 1994) inmore superficial areas of\nthe ML (Fig. 2c). Because our previous experiments with cesium\ndid not influence rise times at all, we conclude that the slower rise\ntimes of parallel fiber EPSCs compared with ascending axon EP-\nSCs most likely result from the activation of parallel fibers with\nmixed conduction velocities leading to reduced synchronicity of\nsynapse activation, rather than differential electrotonic filtering.\nNevertheless, in subsequent experiments, parallel fiber pathway\nresponses were evoked by placing the stimulating electrode\nwithin a bandnomore than 100\u0001mfrom the PC layer, because in\nthese positions, parallel fiber EPSC kinetics most closely approx-\nimated those of ascending axon responses.\nEnhanced levels of paired-pulse facilitation at parallel\nfiber synapses\nGC3PC synapses characteristically exhibit frequency-\ndependent facilitation (Perkel et al., 1990; Llano et al., 1991), a\nform of short-term plasticity often observed at excitatory syn-\napses that release transmitter with a relatively low probability\n(Zucker, 1989; Thomson, 2000). When compared in the same\ncell, the degree of facilitation at parallel fiber pathways, assessed\nby calculating the PPR of pairs of pulses separated by 50 ms, was\nconsistently and significantly higher than that at ascending axon\npathways (parallel fiber pathway, 1.74 \u0007 0.05; ascending axon\npathway, 1.53\u0007 0.04; n\t 41; p\b 0.001; Wilcoxon signed rank\ntest) (Fig. 1b,c). The degree of facilitation at parallel fiber synapses\ndid not depend on the position of the stimulating electrode\nwithin the ML (Fig. 2d) and remained enhanced compared with\nascending axon levels when cesium-based internal patch solu-\ntions were used (Table 1). PPRs at both pathways were indepen-\ndent of the stimulus intensity (Fig. 3a), and parallel fiber PPRs\nwere significantly greater than those at ascending axon synapses\nat pulse intervals between 50 and 200 ms (Fig. 3b,c). Very little\nPPF was observed in either pathway at pulse intervals over 200\nms. In the light of the recent observation that GCs fire brief bursts\nof action potentials at high frequencies (Chadderton et al., 2004),\nour data suggest that mossy fiber information will be amplified\nrelatively more at parallel fiber synapses to PCs than at ascending\naxon synapses.\nTo establish whether enhanced PPF at parallel fibers was syn-\naptic in origin rather than through fiber recruitment as has been\nsuggested previously (Kocsis et al., 1983; Isope and Barbour,\n2002), whole-cell recordings of PC responses to paired parallel\nfiber stimulation were combined with simultaneous extracellular\nmeasurements of the parallel fiber volley. Responses were elicited\nover a range of stimulus intensities to establish the level of change\nin parallel fiber volley required to double the size of the EPSC.\nThis essentially provides the relationship between volley size and\npostsynaptic response. From this, we can estimate the relative\nincrease in volley size necessary to account for the enhanced level\nof PPF if recruitment were the sole cause (Fig. 4a,b). The postsyn-\naptic response to the first of the two stimuli displayed a direct,\nlinear relationship with the size of the parallel fiber volley (Fig.\n4c). Therefore, as expected, the postsynaptic response increases\nproportionally with the number of activated parallel fibers. In\ncontrast, although the second postsynaptic response displayed\nfacilitation compared with the first, the presynaptic parallel fiber\nvolley did not facilitate at all (Fig. 4d), even at intensities that\nyielded EPSC response with amplitudes \u00051 nA. Thus, at the in-\ntensities of stimulation used throughout this study, paired stim-\nulation did not lead to fiber recruitment, and hence we can con-\nclude that it is not a significant contributory factor for the\nelevated PPRs encountered at parallel fiber synapses.\nStimulation of the ML activates beams of parallel fibers that\npresumablymake contact with a given PC in a fairly localized area\n(Vranesic et al., 1994). Such a dense activation of several individ-\nual synapses in a relatively confined region could lead to excessive\nor prolonged transmitter release, whichmight alter EPSCkinetics\nby influencing transmitter uptake or leading to spillover onto\nextrasynaptic receptors. A comparison of the waveforms of first\nand second EPSCs to paired stimulation of either pathway did\nFigure 5. The effects of \u0003-DGG on ascending axon and parallel fiber EPSCs.

Ascending axon synaptic responses were reduced by\nNBQXto64%of control levels comparedwith 54% forparallel fiber\nresponses (n\t4;p\u00050.05;Wilcoxonmatchedpairs test)butdidnot\nalter the level of PPF in either pathway.\nWe next examined the effects of the low-affinity, competitive,\nAMPA receptor antagonist \u0003-D-glutamyl-\nglycine (\u0003DGG; Tocris Cookson) whose ef-\nficacy for blocking glutamatergic transmis-\nsion depends on synaptic glutamate\nconcentration (Clements et al., 1992). Be-\ncause \u0003DGG can also block NMDA recep-\ntors, which are present presynaptically at\nGC3PC synapses, the selective NMDA\nreceptor antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phos-\nphonopentanoic acid (DL-AP-5; Tocris\nCookson) was first applied. DL-AP-5 did not\naffect PPRs or EPSC kinetics at either path-\nway. Further addition of \u0003DGG reduced as-\ncending axon and parallel fiber pathway\nEPSC amplitudes by 54.1\u0007 4.7 and 49.6\u0007\n5.1% of baseline values but had no effect on\nEPSC rise or decay times at either pathway,\nsuggesting that spillover currents do not\ncontribute significantly to either pathway\nunder these conditionsof synaptic activation\n(Fig. 5). \u0003DGG was less effective against the\namplitudesof the secondofpaired responses\nat both pathways and hence caused an in-\ncrease in PPRs. This is expected if, as is\nthought, PPF represents a presynaptic en-\nhancement of transmitter release. Parallel fi-\nber and ascending axon pathway PPRs were\nboth significantly enhanced compared with\ncontrol values (111.6 and 108.8%of control,\nrespectively; Wilcoxon matched pairs test)\nbut remained significantly different from\neachother, indicating that the enhancedPPF\natparallel fiber synapses isnot attributable to\nspillover.\nStimulation of the GCL 150\u2013300 \u0001m\nlateral to the recorded PC allows the selec-\ntive excitation of parallel fibers without\nany possible contribution from retrograde\nactivation of ascending axon synapses\n(Fig. 6a). Paired stimulation of the distant\nGCL (Fig. 6b,d) yielded levels of PPF that\nwere qualitatively and quantitatively indis-\ntinguishable from those produced by lat-\neral activation of the ML (Fig. 6c,f).\nPaired-pulse ratios for responses to lateral\nGCL and ML stimulation recorded from\nthe same cells were 1.70\u0007 0.04 and 1.74\u0007\n0.07, respectively (n\t 9). Thus, the selec-\ntive enhancement of PPF at parallel fiber\nsynapses neither depends on the pattern or density of fiber acti-\nvation, nor is it a result of retrograde activation of ascending axon\nsynapses.\nActivation of single GCs directly below a recorded PC is not\nonly more likely to elicit a detectable response than activation of\ndistant GCs, the responses tend to have larger unitary EPSC am-\nplitudes (Barbour, 1993; Isope and Barbour, 2002).We therefore\nlooked for differences between ascending axon and parallel fiber\npathways at or around the threshold for detectable responses.\nIncreasing intensities of stimulation of theML or the GCL lateral\nto the recorded PC to activate parallel fibers selectively produced\na gradual increase in EPSC amplitudes (Fig. 6e,g), and it was\ndifficult to discern a clear transition between success and failure.\nIn contrast, gradually increasing the intensity of GCL stimulation\nFigure6.

The mean threshold EPSC ampli-\ntude was \u000640.6 \u0007 6.7 pA (range, \u000621 to\n\u000688 pA; n \t 10). Suprathreshold re-\nsponses were very reliable, showing little\nevidence of failure. Additional increases in\nstimulus intensity produced similar incre-\nmental increases in EPSC amplitudes, pre-\nsumably reflecting the stepwise recruit-\nment of additional single GCs whose\nascending axons form synapses with the\nsame cell. We also used a loose patch tech-\nnique as described previously (Barbour\nand Isope, 2000) to activate single GCs.\nThemean EPSC amplitudes of 18GCs that\ndisplayed measurable and reliable paired\nresponses to cell stimulation were \u000637.1\npA (range,\u00066.9 to\u0006157.1 pA). These val-\nues were similar to those produced by our\nmore simple minimal stimulation tech-\nnique, suggesting that we were indeed dis-\ncriminating single GCs. The levels of PPF\nof responses to minimal stimulation were\n1.36 \u0007 0.07 (n \t 6). Although slightly\nlower than population responses to GCL stimulation in the same\narea, they were not statistically different. These very different\nresponse characteristics of parallel fiber and ascending axon\npathway responses to minimal stimulation raise the possibility\nthat ascending axon synapses may also differ in terms of the\nnumber of release sites contributing to transmission and\/or the\nsize of the postsynaptic response to a given quantal event.\nVariance-mean analysis of parallel fiber and ascending\naxon synapses\nTo help elucidate the source of the differences between ascending\naxon and parallel fiber pathway synapses to PCs, we undertook a\nvariance-mean analysis of synaptic events. Under each of four\nexperimental conditions designed to alter release probability, the\nvariances of the responses in each pathway were calculated and\nplotted against the mean EPSC amplitudes (Fig. 8). A parabola\nwas then fitted to the data, and from that the weighted mean\nrelease probability, the minimum number of release sites con-\ntributing to the response, and the weighted mean quantal ampli-\ntude were calculated (Silver et al., 1998; Reid andClements, 1999;\nClements and Silver, 2000).\nIn all seven cells inwhich a complete set of data were obtained,\nthe variance-mean relationships of the first of paired EPSC re-\nsponses to ascending axon and parallel fiber pathways revealed\nsignificant differences in synaptic properties. At stimulation\nstrengths that yielded equivalent-sized mean EPSC amplitudes\n(ascending axon,\u0006139\u0007 11 pA; parallel fiber,\u0006143\u0007 23 pA),\nascending axon pathway responses yielded values ofQ\t\u00068.5\u0007\n1. 21 pA (mean\u0007 SEM), p\t 0.44\u0007 0.04 (in 2.5mM extracellular\ncalcium), andNmin\t 42.5\u0007 6.4. Parallel fiber pathway responses\ngave values ofQ\t\u00066.3\u0007 0.9 pA, p\t 0.30\u0007 0.03, andNmin\t\n84.7\u0007 17.8. Values forQ, P, andNmin were all statistically signif-\nicantly different ( p \b 0.05; Wilcoxon signed ranks test; two-\ntailed; n\t 7). The apparent difference in quantal amplitude be-\ntween ascending axon and parallel fiber pathway synaptic\nresponsesmight suggest a difference in the amount of transmitter\nreleased per synaptic event or a difference in postsynaptic re-\nsponse to a quantal event, perhaps indicating a difference in re-\nceptor number or even subunit composition. As mentioned pre-\nviously, dendritic filtering could also lead to an underestimate of\nQ if one set of synapses were systematically located at sites more\ndistant from the point of recording. However, modeling studies\nsuggest that the position of the synapse with respect to the PC\ndendritic tree has very little influence on EPSC amplitudes (Roth\nand Ha\u00a8usser, 2001). Other potential sources of error such as sys-\ntematic differences in series resistance can also be discounted,\nbecause pathway responses were always compared in the same\ncell.\nVariance-mean data for the second response of the paired\nstimuli for both pathways fell on the same parabolic function\ndefined by the first (Fig. 8c,d). This observation is important\nbecause it provides strong evidence that PPF at both pathways\nresults from a presynaptic enhancement of release probability\nrather than a change in the number of contributing release sites or\na change in the quantal amplitude. Together, these data provide\nclear evidence that the mean probability of transmitter release at\nascending axon pathway synapses is greater than that at parallel\nfiber pathway synapses.\nWe next examined whether synaptic inputs from parallel fi-\nbers and ascending axons to the same cell responded differently\nto trains of seven stimuli applied at intervals of 50 ms. Under our\nstandard extracellular calcium conditions of 2.5mM, responses to\nML stimulation facilitated until a plateau was reached after the\nfourth or fifth response. A representative example from a total of\nfive separate recordings is shown in Figure 9a. The peak response\ntoGCL stimulation occurred after the second or in some cases the\nthird pulse, with subsequent responses depressing (Fig. 9b). Low-\nering the probability of release by reducing the extracellular cal-\ncium concentration to 1.0 mM reduced the average amplitude of\nthe initial EPSC in the train as expected but caused a much more\npronounced augmentation of successive parallel fiber responses.\nUnder these conditions, ascending axon synapses no longer de-\npressed but facilitated and reached a sustained peak. These data\nfurther suggest that under equivalent experimental conditions of\nFigure 7. Characteristics of GC3 PC EPSCs evoked by stimulation of the GCL directly below a recorded PC. Data are presented\nas in Figure 6.\n3252 \u2022 J.

Moreover, the\nhigher probabilities of release encountered at ascending axon\nsynapses are accompanied by a reduced ability to follow repetitive\nactivation of GCs.\nLTD is absent at ascending axon synapses to PCs\nOur data so far reveal that differences in quantal amplitude and\nrelease probability between axonal segments of the same axon\narise, but howmight these specializations arise, andwhat purpose\nmight they serve? Several forms of plasticity at GC3PC synapses\nhave been described previously (Hartell, 2002; Ito, 2002). Of\nthese, the best understood is cerebellar LTD, which occurs when\nGC activity coincides repetitively with CF\nactivity and results in a postsynaptic re-\nduction in synaptic efficacy, probably via\ndownregulation (Wang and Linden, 2000)\nor declustering of AMPA receptors (Mat-\nsuda et al., 2000). In the event that the\nlowermean quantal amplitude observed at\nparallel fiber synapses represented an in-\nherent susceptibility to or was a result of\nthe previous induction of LTD, we com-\npared the abilities of ascending axon syn-\napses and parallel fiber synapses to\nundergo LTD through conjunctive stimu-\nlation with the CF input. PairingML stim-\nulation with CF activation produced a\nclear depression at parallel fiber pathway\nsynapses, but this did not spread to as-\ncending axon pathway synapses (Fig. 10a).\nThirty minutes after pairing, ML EPSC\namplitudes were 72 \u0007 4.5% of baseline\ncompared with no change (100.3 \u0007\n10.3%) for GCL EPSCs (n \t 8) (Fig.\n10c,e). Pairing GCL stimulation with CF\nactivation, on the other hand, failed to\nproduce a LTD at either pathway (GCL,\n95.5 \u0007 12.2%; ML, 98.7 \u0007 12.7%; n \t 7)\n(Fig. 10b,d,e). Therefore, LTD appears to\nbe expressed selectively at parallel fiber\nsynapses.\nIt is not feasible to apply a full variance-\nmean analysis before and after LTD induc-\ntion to assess the extent and origins of syn-\naptic changes. Therefore, we used a more\nsimple comparison of the coefficients of\nvariation of synaptic responses before and\nafter LTD and other patterns of control\nstimulation to both pathways. In this\nmodel, the reciprocal of the square of the\ncoefficient of variation of synaptic re-\nsponse is directly proportional toNP\/(1\u0006\nP) and hence independent ofQ, whileM\t\nNPQ (Bekkers and Stevens, 1990; Faber\nand Korn, 1991). This model can be effec-\ntive for distinguishing synaptic changes of\npostsynaptic origin. Figure 10f compares\nthe relative changes in mean amplitude\nand CV\u00062 with respect to baseline condi-\ntions for ML and GCL pathways after each\nof four different stimulation conditions.\nThe selective depression of ML responses\nafter pairing with CF stimulation was not accompanied by a sig-\nnificant change in CV\u00062, indicating a postsynaptic origin.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we tested the hypothesis that differences in the\nproperties of synapses formed onto PCs by ascending and parallel\nfiber sections of theGC axon provide the basis for this differential\nweighting of synaptic information. By comparing the levels of\nshort-term facilitation and response variability over a range of\nrelease conditions, we provide evidence that ascending axon syn-\napses release transmitter with higher mean release probabilities\nand mean quantal amplitudes than parallel fiber synapses. As-\ncending axon synapses were also found to be selectively resistant\nFigure8.

Examples of 20 individual sweeps (gray lines) along with the calculatedmean response (black lines) are shown for\neach extracellular solution, for ascending axon and parallel fiber pathway stimulation (a).

Neurosci., March 23, 2005 \u2022 25(12):3246\u20133257 \u2022 3253\nto cerebellar LTD. These results lead us to\nconclude that synaptic specialization\nwithin different segments of the same\naxon, as a result of the selective induction\nof plasticity, not only accounts for the re-\nported patterns of GC3PC transmission\nacross the cerebellar cortex, but also re-\nveals an additional level of functionality\nand complexity of cerebellar processing.\nThe possibility that parallel fibers ex-\nhibit a greater degree of PPF than ascend-\ning axon synapses has been alluded to an-\necdotally, but this difference was formerly\nattributed to either differential fiber re-\ncruitment or transmitter spillover (Isope\nand Barbour, 2002). Simultaneous mea-\nsurement of the intracellular EPSC and the\nextracellular parallel fiber volley revealed\nthat PPF was not accompanied by fiber re-\ncruitment, and therefore the difference in\nPPF between pathways is synaptic in ori-\ngin. PPF at both pathways was unaffected\nby the composition of the internal patch\nsolution. Whereas cesium-based internal\nsolutions containing QX314 improve\nspace clamp, our PPRmeasurements indi-\ncate that the space-clamp conditions using\npotassium gluconate-based solutions,\nmore appropriate for the induction of syn-\naptic plasticity, are adequate for obtaining\naccurate measurements of amplitude.\nVariance-mean analysis confirmed that\nascending axon synapses released trans-\nmitter with a higher probability than par-\nallel fiber synapses. The fact that variance-\nmean analysis of the second of a pair of\nstimuli was described by the same para-\nbolic function as the first provides strong\nevidence that the differences in PPF were\nindeed attributable to differences in re-\nlease probability. Variance-mean analysis additionally revealed\nthat ascending axon synapses have higher mean quantal ampli-\ntudes and probabilities of transmitter release than those formed\nby parallel fiber segments of the axon. Weighted mean values for\nQ and P at ascending axon synapses were estimated to be \u00068.5\nand 0.44 pA, respectively (in 2.5 mM extracellular calcium). Our\nestimation of release probability is seemingly at odds with the\nreported single GC3PC failure rates of \b10% (i.e., a success\nprobability of\u00050.9) (Isope and Barbour, 2002). However, these\ntwoways of expressing synaptic probability are not equivalent. In\nthis study, P represents the mean probability per release site.\nUsing our estimate ofP in a simple binomialmodel of transmitter\nrelease, similar failure rates can be obtained if we predict that a\ngiven PC receives, on average, contact from three to four release\nsites per ascending axon. Evidence for multiple release sites at\nsingle synapses does exist at connections between inhibitory neu-\nrons in the cerebellum (Auger et al., 1998). GC3PC synapses\ndisplay an average of seven to eight docked vesicles, and although\nthis could indicate multivesicular release, the relationship be-\ntween docked vesicles, release sites, and release probability is un-\nclear (Xu-Friedman et al., 2001).\nThree to four release sites at a single ascending axon synapse,\neach with a mean Q of \u00068.5 pA, would produce a theoretical\nmean unitary single GC amplitude of between \u000611 and \u000615 pA.\nThis is in reasonably close agreement with those produced by stim-\nulationof singleGCsadjacent toPCsoma(IsopeandBarbour,2002)\nbut somewhat lower than ourmean value of\u000640.6 pA (range,\u000621\nto\u000688 pA), which is closer to values reported in a previous study\nfrom the same laboratory (Barbour, 1993). Such large unitary am-\nplitudes would require release from \u000510 individual release sites.\nAscending axonsmake\u000330 synaptic contacts before forming paral-\nlel fibers (Pichitpornchai et al., 1994). Because of their flat structure,\ntherewill be little intermingling of adjacent PCdendrites, and so it is\nit is tempting to speculate that these larger, single GC EPSCs repre-\nsent ascending axons that make multiple synaptic contacts with a\nsingle PC. Applying the same binomial model to our estimated val-\nues ofQ and P at parallel fiber synapses (\u00066.3 and 0.3 pA), a failure\nrate of\b10% requires six to seven release sites, producing a mean\nEPSC amplitude of between\u000611 and\u000613 pA. This is again similar\nto the values reportedby Isope andBarbour (2002)buthighlights an\nimportant advantage of variance-mean analysis over estimations of\nfailure rate; similar failure rates can be observed at synapses with\ndifferent release probabilities if the synapses release more than one\nvesicle at a time. Given that parallel fibers make one and rarely two\ncontacts with a single PC (Harvey and Napper, 1991), this would\nsuggest that parallel fiber synapses are multivesicular.\nFigure 9. Ascending axon synapses cannot sustain facilitation to trains of stimuli. Single-cell examples illustrating the effects\nof trains of seven stimuli applied to the ML (a) and GCL (b) in the presence of 2.5 mM (top) and 1.0 mM (bottom) extracellular\ncalcium are shown.

Neurosci., March 23, 2005 \u2022 25(12):3246\u20133257 Sims and Hartell \u2022 Functional Differences between Granule Cell3Purkinje Cell Synapses\nThe combination of higher P, higher Q, as well as the possi-\nbility of multiple synaptic contacts per cell, enables ascending\naxon synapses to activate PCs situated directly above the termi-\nnation zone of their afferentmossy fiber inputs with a high degree\nof reliability. Repetitive stimulation of ascending axon synapses\nproduced only small degrees of facilitation at the second pulse\nand subsequent pulses declined in amplitude (Fig. 9). In contrast,\nparallel fiber responses did not decline in amplitude but contin-\nued to augment up to the fourth or fifth response before reaching\na plateau. Lowering the probability of release led to a muchmore\ndramatic facilitation of parallel fiber responses to brief trains of\nstimuli. Interestingly, these conditions caused ascending axon\nsynapses to actmore like parallel fiber syn-\napses behaved at higher concentrations of\nexternal calcium. These data also reveal\nthat the higher probability of release at as-\ncending synapses comes at the expense of a\nfaster rate of depletion. In combination\nwith the lowerQ, these characteristics per-\nmit parallel fibers to act as high-pass filters.\nLTD was induced selectively at parallel\nfiber synapses. This observation is of fun-\ndamental importance because it reveals for\nthe first time that not all GC synapses to\nPCs are equally able to undergo plastic\nchanges at this stage of development in the\nrat cerebellar cortex, and therefore they\nshould not be considered a homogenous\npopulation. Given that LTDwas accompa-\nnied by a reduction in Q (consistent with\nthe accepted postsynaptic expression of\ncerebellar LTD), it is tempting to speculate\nthat the lower mean quantal amplitude of\nparallel fiber synapses is a consequence of\nLTD and that this accounts for the high\nproportion of apparently silent or possibly\n\u201cdeaf\u201d synapses encountered along beams\nof parallel fibers (Isope and Barbour,\n2002).\nThe mechanism of cerebellar synaptic\ndepression is complex but can be simpli-\nfied into the following three essential ele-\nments: LTD requires activation of AMPA\nreceptors, metabotropic glutamate recep-\ntors (mGluRs), and postsynaptic calcium\ninflux (Ito, 2001; Hartell, 2002). Because\nascending axon and parallel fiber synapses\nwere similarly blocked by NBQX, both\npathways are capable of activating AMPA\nreceptors. mGluRs are situated at the pe-\nriphery of excitatory synapses to PCs (Pe-\ntralia et al., 1998), and they are activated at\nhigher frequencies of stimulation (Batch-\nelor and Garthwaite, 1997; Finch and Au-\ngustine, 1998; Takechi et al., 1998). The\nreduced ability of ascending axons to un-\ndergo PPF and follow higher frequencies\nof train stimulation may, therefore, make\nthem less able to activate mGluRs. It will\nbe interesting to establish whether\nmGluRs are expressed similarly at ascend-\ning axon and parallel fiber synapses. LTD\nalso requires activation of the CF, which\ncauses a postsynaptic influx of calcium. Because ascending axon\nsynapses formon smaller,more distal synapses (Gundappa-Sulur\net al., 1999), it is conceivable that they may fall outside the influ-\nence of the CF, which contacts larger, more proximal dendrites\n(Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974).\nThe fact that ascending axon synapses were resistant to LTD,\nas predicted previously (Gundappa-Sulur et al., 1999), further\nsuggests that they serve a fundamentally different role from that\nof parallel fibers. Whereas ascending axons are essentially hard\nwired into the cortical sensory circuit and behave like event de-\ntectors, parallel fibers have the capacity to undergo both short-\nand long-term changes in synaptic strength and hence play a\nFigure 10. Cerebellar LTD is confined to synapses activated by ML stimulation. Single-cell examples illustrating the effects of\nconjunctive activation of the CF input with ML stimulation (a) and GCL stimulation (b) are shown.

A recent\nstudy showed that GCs have low intrinsic background firing\nrates, but they reliably undergo high-frequency burst firing on\ndirect stimulation of their sensory receptive fields (Chadderton et\nal., 2004). According to our findings, which support several pre-\ndictions based on modeling studies of ascending axon input to\nPCs (Santamaria et al., 2002), brief bursts of GC activity would be\nreliably transmitted via ascending axon synapses to PCs directly\nabove the mossy fiber termination zone of sensory input to the\nreceptive field. This therefore extends the remarkable ability of\nthe input layers of the cortex to balance high sensitivity of trans-\nmission with high signal-to-noise ratio selectively to PCs con-\ntacted by ascending axon synapses. Bursts of GC activity will be\nfurther filtered by parallel fiber synapses such that information\nwill be transmitted selectively to those PCs whose synaptic con-\ntacts are not silent or in a depressed state. Therefore, at any given\npoint in time, MF information will be transmitted according to\nthe past learned experience of parallel fiber3PC synapses, thus\nmaintaining a system for pattern recognition. This network does\nnot, however, preclude additional learning or the reversal of plas-\ntic changes, because the repetitive bursts of GC activity required\nfor all forms of plasticity thus far identified at GC3PC synapses\n(including LTD and presynaptic and postsynaptic forms of long-\nterm potentiation) will pass through the parallel fiber filtering\nsystem.Wewould predict from this that ascending axon synapses\nwill be relatively resistant to all forms of GC3PC plasticity com-\npared with parallel fiber synapses.\nIn terms of cerebellar processing, we suggest that ascending\naxon synapses should now be considered as an entirely separate\nelement of cortical signal processing to parallel fiber synapses in\nfuture experimental and theoretical studies of cerebellar signaling\nand plasticity.\nReferences\nAlbus JS (1971) A theory of cerebellar function.
