It is an important issue for the ceramics industry, but has been the subject of\nrelatively little systematic research. This paper will show how certain manufacturing concepts -\nused in a number of industries - can be applied to the scale up of a feasibility study level, aqueous\ntape casting process. In particular, it examines the elements of process standardisation using the\nexample of the Statistical Process Control (SPC) technique applied to a sub process of an aqueous\npowder process. It illustrates that these elements are an essential step in moving from conceptual\ndesign to the process prototype.\nIntroduction\nThe design of any new process develops through four main stages which are widely described in the\nexisting literature [1, 2]. Before the scale up stage, the process needs to be attuned to meet the final\nrequirements (specifications), within a narrow interval of deviation (tolerance). Variation in\nprocesses causes waste and consequently increases costs. Whilst this variation is intrinsic in every\nproduction process, it can be minimised. The methodology to reach this target is to develop the\ndesign into a regime of \u2018Total Quality\u2019.\nThe methodology to improve design is based on the use of statistical methods for decision making.\nThe Statistical Process Control (SPC) technique has become a standard tool in many manufacturing\nsectors to implement, analyse, assess and control process variation, since its application has been\nproved to enhance problems and reduce costs [3, 4, 5, 6]. It is mainly used to control industrial\nprocess variation during production. However, the application of control charts provides a simple\nyet powerful tool for presenting and studying results in process scale up. For this reason, SPC has\nbeen chosen to help in the passage from the conceptual design phase to the definitive design. This\ntechnique can be applied either to entire processes or to parts of them. SPC has four main stages: the\nrecognition of process variables, the identification of which process parameters should be\nmonitored, the collection and analysis of the process data and capabilities and finally the control of\nthe process through charts.\nThis paper presents an application of such a technique to an aqueous ceramic process. The SPC\nprocedure was applied to a sub-process activity on a laboratory scale, as a case study to show an\napproach to the problem of defining the capability of a process to meet the requirements, and to\ndefining the settings and controls for an operation.\nMethod\nNavarro et al. developed an aqueous laboratory tape casting process for use with PZT powders. The\nexperimental conditions developed for this process are described elsewhere [7, 8].\nA study [9] assessed the warm pressing technique as a suitable method for the lamination of green\ntape. A side-effect of this process is an increase in the green density of tape cast ceramic up to 65%\nof the theoretical density, improving the quality of the final sintered microstructure. A green density\nof (5.00 \u00b1 0.1) g\/cm3 (60-62% of the theoretical density) was decided to be the optimum\ncompromise for a satisfactory sintered microstructure, since 65% was considered very close to a\nmaximum random packing factor [10]. These values were taken as the process specifications and\ntolerances. Formally, for \u00b1 0.1 g\/cm3 the upper and lower specification limits were: USL= 5.1 g\/cm3\nand LSL = 4.9 g\/cm3. Hence, the specifications tolerance limit was 0.2 g\/cm3.\nA G.E.Moore warm press was used. The pressing settings were 50 MPa for 20 minutes at 50 oC.\nPressings were performed in a stack of 5 (n); the tapes were separated by a polypropylene sheet to\navoid lamination, so that individual layers could be analysed. The experiment was performed\nthrough 4 consecutive days and each day the pressure settings were re-inputted.\nThe sample thickness was taken as the process parameter to be monitored. 100 samples of 16 cm2\narea were pressed (s = 20 stacks). The thickness was measured using a micrometer gauge with a\ntolerance of 5 \uf06dm. The density of each sample was calculated by measuring the dimensions (area\nand thickness) and mass. The pressed density was used as the variable for the process charts. Basic\ntools of the SPC technique (such as individual observation, mean and range charts) were used to\nplot the green density figures. The data were assumed to approximate a normal distribution. The\nstatistics were analysed and compared with the specifications and the required tolerances.\nResults and Discussion\nFig.1 shows the individual observations of sample density together with the upper and lower control\n(at 3\uf073 from the mean line) and warning limit lines (at 2\uf073 from the mean line). The pressed green\ndensity of a single tape varied between 4.4 and 5.0 g\/cm3. The average (mean) was 4.70 g\/cm3 while\nthe standard deviation (\uf073) was 0.15.\nThe means and ranges of the sample densities were recorded for each stack. The relevant mean (X)\nand range (R) charts were consequently produced with the calculated values of the mean of the\nmeans (X) and the mean of the range (R) of the stacks. The UCL and LCL lines were placed\nrespectively at 3\uf073 (n)-1\/2 above and below the average values of the mean of the means (X) and the\nmean of the range (R) as shown in Fig. 2. Table 1 reports the values of the main figures used for the\nanalysis.\nIndividual observation chart\n4.00\n4.20\n4.40\n4.60\n4.80\n5.00\n5.20\n5.40\nsample\npr\nes\nse\nd\nde\nn\nsi\nty\n[g\n\/c\nm\n3 ]\nFig 1: Individual observation\nchart: upper and lower control\nlimits (UCL, LCL) lines, mean\nline X, and specification line\nLight dots: UCL and LCL\nUniform: X\nHeavy Dots: Warning lines\nDashed: Specification\nTable 1: Calculated values for UCL, LCL, and means for the mean and range charts\nMean chart\n4.40\n4.60\n4.80\n5.00\n5.20\n1 3 5 7 9 11 14 16 18 20\nsamples\ng\nre\nen\nd\nan\nsi\nty\n[g\n\/c\nm\n3 ]\nA) B)\nRange chart\n0.00\n0.20\n0.40\n1 3 5 7 9 11 14 16 18 20\nsamples\nsa\nm\np\nle\nra\nn\ng\ne\n[g\n\/c\nm\n3 ]\nFig 2: A) Mean chart with calculated UCL, LCL\nand mean X lines\nB) Range chart with calculated UCL, LCL and\nMean R lines\nThe individual observation chart (Fig. 1) gives the first indication of process control.

The individual observation chart indicates that no values were out of the LCL to UCL\nrange. However, in some circumstances densities were found outside of the 2\uf073 warning lines.\nMoreover, rows of points (greater than 8 in succession) were located on the same side of the mean.\nThese observations are the first indicators of an \u2018uncontrolled\u2019 process. Figs. 2A and 2B confirm\nthis. The mean density and range show sometimes scatter outside of the UCL to LCL range. Five or\nsix points in succession were observed with either consecutive increasing or decreasing trends.\nIt can be noted that the specification value of green density, 5.00 g\/cm3, was rarely achieved. In fact,\nthis value was the highest density attained. Useful indexes to compare the process results with the\nspecifications are Cpku defined as (USL-X)\/3\uf073, and Cpkl defined as (LSL- X)\/3\uf073. For the studied\nprocess Cpku was 0.889 and Cpkl as 0.44. Both of the values are far below 1, which indicates that\nthe process is not capable at any time to achieve the requirements. An easy to obtain measure of the\nprocess \u2018capability\u2019 is Cp defined as (specifications tolerance interval)\/6\uf073. This index compares the\nvariability of the process (the interval 6\uf073) with the tolerance of the specifications. For the process\nanalysed in this work, Cp was 0.44, so the variability of the process is greater than the specifications\ntolerance interval.\nThese remarks lead to the conclusions that the process:\n- was not \u2018in control\u2019\n- did not meet the specification required (i.e. it was not centred on the specification value)\n- had variations greater then the tolerance interval.\nThe \u2018not-in-control\u2019 situation was not unexpected, since the process was at the early stages of its\ndevelopment. However, the analysis conducted highlighted the importance of a further study in\norder to define the conditions for an optimal design. Furthermore, without such an analysis,\nvariability in final sintered density may have been assumed to be associated with variability of the\nsintering process, rather than control of laminate green density.\nOn the basis of the above data, a \u2018cause-effect\u2019 analysis was conducted to elicit all contributing\nfactors to a variation in the pressed density. The results are shown in Fig 3.\nFig.3: Fishbone analysis: contribution factors to pressed green density\nEach of the listed factors noted in Fig.3 was ranked:\n- The material used was obtained from the same cast tape for all the samples. Therefore it was\nunlikely to be the dominant factor in the density variability.\n- The exposure of the samples to external conditions was negligible; hence environmental\ncontribution was taken as minimal.\n- The measurement techniques were assessed. Two different techniques were compared for the\nevaluation of the sample areas (geometrical and digital), the thickness (two micrometers) and the\nmass (two balances). A maximum error in density of 0.6% was detected. Therefore, the influence of\nthe measurement technique was insignificant compared to the process variations.\n- The configuration of the samples in the press was checked. Some samples shifted postion on\nmounting into the press, introducing a taper to the pressed samples. If the density data of those\nsamples was eliminated from the chart analysis as assignable causes no improvement in process\nShift of the\nsamples\nTaper of\nStack\nPRESSED GREEN\nDENSITY\nTemperatureHumidity\nCompositionArea\nTemperature\nCONFIGURATION ENVIRONMENT EQUIPMENT\nLoad\nMEASURING MATERIAL\nMoisture\nWeight\nThickness\ncontrol was found. It was therefore concluded that this factor was not the main cause of the\nvariability.\n- The equipment pressure setting was considered an important variation factor, since the applied\nload was reconfigured each day.\nAs a result of the above analysis, control charts plotting day by day control limits were drawn\nshowing the variation with pressure re-setting, i.e. the variability each day. These are presented in\nFig 4 A and B. In the new charts the means line is usually contained within the band of the control\nlimits. This is an indication of a day by day \u2018controlled\u2019 state\nMean chart \"day by day\"\n4.40\n4.60\n4.80\n5.00\n5.20\n1 3 5 7 9 11 14 16 18 20\nsamples\ng\nre\nen\nd\nan\nsi\nty\n[g\n\/c\nm\n3 ]\nA)\nRange chart \"day by day\"\n0.00\n0.20\n0.40\n1 3 5 7 9 11 14 16 18 20\nsamples\nsa\nm\np\nle\nra\nn\ng\ne\n[g\n\/c\nm\n3 ]\nB)\nFig 4: A) Mean chart with day by day variation B) Range chart with day by day variation\nHence the variability in the setting of the load on the equipment was evaluated to be the assignable\ncause of density variation. On investigation it was noted that the equipment used for the experiment\nwas oversized compared to the sample size, producing difficulties in accurately controlling load.\nLarger sample sizes or redesigned load controls could bring the process back within acceptable\ntolerances. Secondly, the analysis suggested that the pressing conditions of 50 MPa were an\nunderestimate, since the required final density was rarely obtained. An increase in pressure is\ntherefore suggested. However, the density value required (5.0 g\/cm3, 61% of the theoretical density)\nis close to the achievable maximum.\nConclusions\nA warm-pressing process for laminating aqueous tape-cast ceramic tape was analysed with the SPC\ntechnique in order to assess its capability of meeting the required process specifications. The\nprocess was found incapable of meeting the requirements and was in an \u2018uncontrolled regime\u2019.\nProblem solving techniques were applied to find the causes and investigate the possible solutions.\nThe problem solving analysis yielded the conclusion that the most significant factor for the lack of\nprocess control lay in the control of pressure on the equipment. Moreover, the designed conditions\nfor the process were judged insufficient for the achievement of the targeted specifications.\nSuggestions for further development of the process were given.\nReferences\n[1] S.
