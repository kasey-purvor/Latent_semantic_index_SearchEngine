Perez Arenas HYBRID BOUNDARY, Revision 1\n3\n1 Introduction\nIntense sound waves are formed in the intake systems of I.C. (internal combustion) engines.\nA proportion of the sound power contained in these waves is radiated as intake orifice noise\nand is of primary interest to vehicle refinement engineers. Poor control of intake orifice noise\nmay result in the failure of the legislative pass by noise test or may cause adverse comment\nfrom potential customers.\nThe sound waves can also affect the power performance of naturally aspirated I.C. engines\n[1]. By phasing the waves so that a high pressure is caused directly behind the intake valve\n20-50o of crankshaft rotation before it closes, the volumetric efficiency of the engine can be\nimproved. At low volumetric efficiencies, the sound waves are the resonant response of the\nintake system to excitation caused by unsteady mass flow through the intake valve [2]. At\nhigher volumetric efficiencies, for instance those found in racing engines, the conversion of\ninflow momentum to static pressure rise on the back of the closing inlet valves is also\nimportant [3].\nThis paper concerns the calculation of the wave dynamics in the intake systems of naturally\naspirated I.C. engines. In particular it presents a method for improving the boundary\nconditions required to solve the one-dimensional Euler equations that are commonly used to\ndescribe the wave dynamics in time and space.\nSection 2 opens with a discussion of possible boundary conditions to solve the Euler\nequations in one dimension. It goes on to explain why quasi steady state boundary conditions\nM.F. Harrison, R. Perez Arenas HYBRID BOUNDARY, Revision 1\n4\nexpressed in the form of Riemann invariants are almost exclusively used in the time domain\nsimulation of engine performance. The limitations of such boundaries are considered.\nSection 3 describes a hybrid boundary that uses the results of a linear acoustic model to\ngenerate a frequency variable (and therefore non-quasi steady state) boundary that may be\nexpressed in terms of Riemann invariants.\nSection 4 compares the results of calculations made using a traditional quasi steady state\nboundary condition with the results obtained using the hybrid boundary. Conclusions are\ndrawn in Section 5.\n2 Boundary conditions to the 1-D Euler equations\nThe general equations that govern fluid motion can easily be written down if the scalar and\nvector conservation laws are applied to an arbitrary control volume [4]. These can be\nreduced to the Euler equations by setting the viscosity and the thermal conductivity\ncoefficient to zero. By considering one-dimensional flow only, the Euler equations are the\nfollowing continuity, momentum and energy equations:\n0\nx\nu\u03c1\nx\n\u03c1\nu\nt\n\u03c1 \uf03d\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n(1)\nefx\np\n\u03c1\n1\nx\nu\nu\nt\nu \uf03d\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n(2)\nM.F.

The style was adopted by Benson for his\nwork on the simulation of wave action in I.C. engine intake \/ exhaust systems [5]. Benson\nbegan this work in the mid 1950\u2019s and his style of presentation was clearly influenced by\ncontemporary publications by Shapiro [6] and Bannister and Mucklow [7] that he referenced\nregularly [5]. Although Benson\u2019s book [5] is now out of print, it\u2019s influence is still clear in\ncontemporary texts on I.C. engine breathing [8]. Because of the wide dissemination of books\nand papers that use the Benson style, two generations of engineers have grown accustomed to\na particular presentation of the equations of motion and a particular pattern of the derivations\nthat flow from them. Because of this, that style is retained here although some comment on it\nis offered.\nFirstly, Winterbone and Pearson [8] state that the form adopted for equations (1,2,3) is the\nnon-conservation law form, whereas the conservation law form would include partial\nderivatives of the products of the variables p, \u03c1, u. Clarifying a similar statement, Hirsch [4]\npoints out that the two forms are fully equivalent from a mathematical point of view but a\nnumerical discretisation of the non-conservation law form would lead to a numerical scheme\nwhere the total mass in the system would not be kept constant. It is well known that the mesh\nM.F. Harrison, R. Perez Arenas HYBRID BOUNDARY, Revision 1\n6\nmethod of characteristics which is based on a discretisation of the non-conservation law form\ndoes not conserve mass.\nSecondly, equations (2,3) differ a little from those shown in [5,8] wherein the friction term fe\nis replaced by\nD\n4\nfuu\n2\n1\nG \uf03d (4)\nwhere D is the hydraulic diameter of the duct and f is the wall friction factor. Bannister and\nMucklow included such a term in their calculation scheme [7]. The modulus of the velocity is\nintroduced to ensure that the pipe wall friction always opposes the fluid motion. In the\nequations of motion presented here, G is replaced by an external force vector per unit mass fe.\nThis avoids the use of equation (4), which is a specific friction model that relies on empirical\ndata for f and the assumption that the friction increases with the square of the velocity. This\nargument is rather an academic one, as fe is eventually neglected in the analysis in Section 2.1\non the assumption of a thin boundary, but the presence of fe rather than G in equations (2,3)\nwarrants a brief explanation.\nThe equations of motion (1,2,3) together form a set of three simultaneous partial differential\nequations with three independent variables p, \u03c1 and u, with a linked variable a where\n\u03c1\n\u03b3p\na 2 \uf03d (5)\nThe equations need both initial and boundary conditions for their solution.\nM.F. Harrison, R. Perez Arenas HYBRID BOUNDARY, Revision 1\n7\nThe initial conditions simply require the definition of the spatial distribution of the primitive\nflow variables \u03c1, u, p along with the appropriate thermodynamic data; temperature (T), the\ngas constant (R), the specific heat capacities (cp, cv) and the heat transfer q.\nBoundary conditions require more detailed consideration which follows in Section 2.1.\n2.1 Boundary conditions: primitive variables and characteristic variables\nStationary solid boundaries should only reflect waves travelling out from the interior of the\ncontrol volume. They should not emit or absorb waves. However, so-called far-field\nboundaries should allow waves to travel in and out of the control volume [10]. Far-field\nboundary conditions must allow an outgoing wave to pass without reflection and in turn\nspecify a corresponding in-going wave.\nIn-going waves carry information from the exterior to the control volume. Assuming that the\nboundary is thin so that the thermodynamic quantities are the same on the inner and outer\nsurfaces, that information could take the form of:\n(i) Conserved quantities (mass, momentum, energy)\n(ii) Primitive flow variables (\u03c1, u, p)\n(iii) So called characteristic variables (vo, v+, v-)\nThe characteristic variables will be derived from equations (1,2,3) in the pattern set out by\nBenson [5] for the same reason that the form of the equations of motion (1,2,3) was adopted.\nM.F. Harrison, R. Perez Arenas HYBRID BOUNDARY, Revision 1\n8\nHowever, the interested reader might seek alternative patterns.

Harrison, R. Perez Arenas HYBRID BOUNDARY, Revision 1\n11\n2.2 The inflow boundary: Riemann invariants\nThe ultimate boundary for the I.C. engine intake system is that of subsonic inflow to a pipe.\nIn this case it can be shown that two quantities only are required to properly specify the\nboundary [10].\nThe boundary is properly specified if the exterior information given uniquely determines the\nincoming characteristic variables when combined with interior information, but these do not\nrestrict or specify the outgoing characteristic variable.\nSpecifying only one exterior primitive variable for the subsonic inflow case obviously under\nspecifies the problem. Specifying all three primitive exterior variables would specify the\noutgoing characteristic value as well as the ingoing characteristic values and therefore the\nboundary would be incorrect.\nTherefore, two exterior primitive variables should be specified. These may be \u03c1 and p or\nequally \u03c1 and u but not u and p because the last case would completely specify both ingoing\nand outgoing characteristic variables [10], (see equations 18,19).\nTo summarise, ingoing and outgoing characteristic values must be considered as a set if a\nboundary is to be considered to be valid.\nFrom the second law of thermodynamics, and assuming an isentropic process we get\ndp = da\n1\u03b3\na2\u03c1\n\uf02d\n(20)\nM.F.

The pair of measurable primitive variables \u03c1, u could be\nspecified but some method of estimating both \u03c1 and u would be required.\nIt would seem obvious to specify the pair of primitive variables p and \u03c1 for the inflow\nboundary. The former of these quantities is easily measured. However, it is only practical to\nspecify the exterior quantities in terms of their static steady state values po and \u03c1o. To do\notherwise would require either a separate analytical model for time varying p and \u03c1 or an\nM.F. Harrison, R. Perez Arenas HYBRID BOUNDARY, Revision 1\n13\nexterior computational grid bounded by a half space. Specifying the static values for p and \u03c1\ninvolves the making of several implicit assumptions. Firstly the boundary is (quasi) steady\nstate. Secondly the amplitude of sound radiated from the inflow orifice is negligibly small\ncompared with the static pressure.\nBoth of the above assumptions are tolerable for application to the intake of a low speed I.C.\nengine where the intake wave action is dominated by frequency components of pressure\nbelow 100Hz [2, 11] but would be less appropriate for high speed engines where wave action\noccurs at 500Hz or more [3].\nMost of the widely used computer codes for I.C. engine simulation use an inflow boundary\nthat specifies po and \u03c1o. However, they generally express these in terms of characteristic\nvariables (Riemann invariants mostly) so as to describe the boundary in terms of outgoing\nand ingoing waves that are easily understood. European examples of this include: Benson\u2019s\nmesh method of characteristics [5], Winterbone and Pearsons total variation diminishing flux\nlimiter method [8, 12], Giannatta\u2019s essentially non-oscillatory finite volume method [13, 14]\nand Onorati\u2019s Lax Wendroff and Mac Cormack method [15]. All four use Riemann variables\nto formulate their inflow boundary. The derivation of this common boundary is as follows.\nWe start with:\n\u03c1\np\u03b3\na 2 \uf03d (23)\nThis presents the primitive pair p, \u03c1 in terms of one variable sound speed a.\nM.F.

The implications of the use of equation (27) are this. Firstly,\nequation (27) expresses the incoming Riemann invariant \u03b2 in terms of the fluctuating\noutgoing Riemann invariant \u03bb, the (fluctuating) gas temperature and chemistry that govern \u03b3, \nM.F. Harrison, R. Perez Arenas HYBRID BOUNDARY, Revision 1\n15\nand the stagnation speed of sound. With the inclusion of that stagnation datum, the boundary\nbecomes quasi-steady state. Secondly, the use of equation (26) in the derivation of (27)\nmeans that homentropic, non-viscous, non-rotational inflow is assumed with the absence of\nexternal forces. Thus, despite the apparent complexity of equation (27) with its many\nbracketed terms, it actually models a rather idealised boundary condition.\nTo summarise the discussion in this section of the paper: the inflow boundary may be\nspecified using the primitive variable pair \u03c1o, po and inspection of the characteristic variables\nshows this to be one of several correct boundary choices. Alternatively, the ratio of these two\nand the isentropic assumption may be used to yield a boundary specified by stagnation sound\nspeed ao and the outgoing characteristic variable. This approach has been widely used to\nsupply an inflow boundary to very different numerical schemes for solving the 1-D Euler\nequations.\n3 A hybrid boundary to the 1-D Euler equations\nIn the previous section it was shown how ao and \u03bb could be used to specify an inflow \nboundary and, hence, determine \u03b2. Although this boundary is correctly specified (it uses only\nthe primitive pair p, \u03c1) it is not accurate at higher frequencies as it is specified by stagnation \nconditions only. Thus, it is a quasi-steady-state boundary.\nThe solution of the 1-D Euler equations would be improved for the inflow case (and other\ncases that otherwise rely on quasi-steady-state boundaries) if a dynamic boundary could be\ndevised. One such boundary is described here.\nM.F. Harrison, R. Perez Arenas HYBRID BOUNDARY, Revision 1\n16\nThe premise for the hybrid boundary is simple. The correct ratio of fluctuation acoustic\npressure to particle velocity may be calculated from linear plane wave acoustic theory at any\ngiven plane in a duct upstream from the point of inflow [17]. This ratio varies with frequency\nand can be used as a boundary condition if \u03bb is given and \u03b2 is found from the isentropic \nrelation\n1\u03b3\n\u03b32\no0 a\na\nP\nP \uf02d\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf03d (28)\nand on substitution of (24) we get\n1\u03b3\n\u03b32\no0 a2\n\u03b2\u03bb\nP\nP \uf02d\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02b\uf03d (29)\nKnowing (29) and (25) we can write\n1\u03b3\n\u03b2\u03bb\nP\na2\n\u03b2\u03bb\nP\nu~\np~\nTT\n0\n1\u03b3\n\u03b32\no\nT\n0\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02b\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\n(30)\n\u03bbT and \u03b2T are time retarded values of the characteristic variables at the hybrid boundary.

If \u03bb is not sinusoidal then \u03b6(f) must be transposed to the time domain using\nthe inverse Fourier transform before equations (30) and (33) can be used.\nThe present hybrid boundary has certain advantages over some alternative hybrid boundaries\nthat are also based on the Riemann variables. Payri et al [19] used a modified method of\nM.F. Harrison, R. Perez Arenas HYBRID BOUNDARY, Revision 1\n18\ncharacteristics to solve the 1-D Euler equations. This produced time domain values for\npositive and negative going pressure waves, which could be transformed to the frequency\ndomain using the fast Fourier transform. These pressure components could then be combined\nwith the output from a linear acoustic model to provide a new set of pressure components,\nwhich became pressure time values with the application of the inverse Fourier transform.\nThe method was iterative, solving the hybrid boundary for one complete cycle at a time. The\nresults of the calculations therefore updated only once every cycle. An initial pressure and\nvelocity field had to be assumed for the calculation to start.\nHarrison and Davies [20] developed a hybrid boundary that was analytical and did not require\nupdating on a cycle by cycle basis nor did it require an initial sound field to start. However,\nit relied on a simplified means of estimating the value of u (t) at the hybrid boundary based\non the gradients of nearby characteristic lines.\nThe present hybrid boundary is an alternative to the early Harrison and Davies boundary that\nneither requires an initial sound field to start nor does it require an estimate of u (t) at the\nhybrid boundary. Both these attributes are seen as useful developments in the field of hybrid\nboundaries.\nThe details of the hybrid boundary will now be presented starting with the simplest case\nwhen \u03bb is sinusoidal and progressing to the more general case where \u03bb is cyclic but not\nsinusoidal. In either case the first step is to calculate a time shift for the hybrid boundary.\nFigure 1 shows the general test case where a length of pipe has a source at the left-hand end\nand an open-end boundary at the other end. The source produces a pressure fluctuation and \u03bb \nM.F. Harrison, R. Perez Arenas HYBRID BOUNDARY, Revision 1\n19\ncharacteristics propagate from left to right in this case. There is no net mass inflow at the\nright-hand end. The propagation is calculated using the mesh method of characteristics\n(MOC) [5].\n3.1 Preliminary calculations made using a quasi-steady state boundary for the open-\nend of a pipe without inflow\nWe declare for the moment that the open-end boundary is a quasi steady state pressure\nrelease boundary. This is a simplification of the inflow boundary described in Section 2.2 but\nis more realistic for the test case that involves a sinusoidal pressure excitation without mean\nflow. The quasi steady state open-end pipe boundary may be derived from the general hybrid\nboundary (33). In the open ended pipe case p = po for all time and (33) reduces to:\n\u03bb\np\npp\n2a\u03b2\n\u03b32\n1\u03b3\no\no\no \uf02d\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9 \uf02b\uf0a2\uf03d\n\uf02d\n0u\u03b6p T \uf03d\uf03d\uf0a2 in this case\n\u03bba2\u03b2 o \uf02d\uf03d (34)\nFigure 2 shows the time history for \u03bb at a point in the pipe that is 0.1m from the source \n(hereafter called the hybrid plane), calculated with a \u2018pure\u2019 MOC and using the boundary\ngiven by equation (34) at the right hand end of the pipe.

Close scrutiny of Figure 2 shows that the value of \u03bb remains at the initial \nlevel equal to ao for a short time.  That time is the time it takes for the \u03bb \u2018wave\u2019 to propagate \nfrom the source plane to the hybrid plane, i.e.\nTIME\u03bb = a\n0.1m \u2243\noa\n0.1 \u2243 0.000293 seconds (36)\nwhere a is the time average wave speed during that short interval.\nThe \u03bb wave continues to propagate until it reaches the open-end boundary where it is\nreflected and a \u03b2 wave is created in accordance with equation (34).

A near zero particle velocity is expected\nat the hybrid plane when a maximum fluctuating pressure is encountered as shown in\nFigure 4.\nFigure 5 highlights one of the problems associated with the mesh method of characteristics,\nthat is a spurious velocity transient formed early in the calculation when the calculation is\nstarted from conditions of rest in the pipe. That transient will propagate up and down the\npipe and will take many cycles to decay [21]. The problem may be avoided if the calculation\nstarts with the non-stagnation conditions in the duct being specified by some other\n(simplified) model [20] such as the one given in [2, 3].\n3.2 Calculations made using a hybrid boundary for the case of an the open-ended\npipe without inflow\nWe return to the general test case in Figure 1. We declare a hybrid boundary (30 or 33) at the\nhybrid plane. For that hybrid boundary to work correctly when used with the mesh method\nof characteristics, the \u03bb and \u03b2 time histories at the hybrid plane should match those produced\nfrom the pure method of characteristics (Figures 2, 3). This can be achieved when the\nfollowing rules are observed:\n(i) For the time period t = 0 to t = \u03b2TIME, \u03b2 at the hybrid plane must retain its initial value.\nM.F. Harrison, R. Perez Arenas HYBRID BOUNDARY, Revision 1\n23\n(ii) Thereafter, \u03b2 may be calculated using either (30 or 33) providing that at time t, the\nvalue of \u03bb used is that corresponding to \u03bb (t \u2013 \u03b4t) = \u03bbT\n\u03b4t = \u03b2TIME \u2013 \u03bbTIME (41)\nand the value of u used is the one corresponding to u (t \u2013 \u03b4t) = uT.\nWhen the sound in the pipe is purely sinusoidal, \u03b6 (f) may be calculated at that frequency \nonly and equation (30 or 33) may be solved in a time marching mesh method of\ncharacteristics calculation providing the time shift rules above are observed. In this case \u03b6 (f) \nhas been found using the theory developed by Davies [17] which has been applied with\nsuccess to the intake systems of practical I.C. engines [2, 3].  Figures 6 and 7 show the \u03bb and \n\u03b2 time histories respectively for a hybrid calculation solving equation (30) for the case of a\n2Pa pressure fluctuating pressure at 96Hz. The 2Pa at 96Hz problem was used earlier in\nSection 3.1 for a pure method of characteristics calculation with a quasi steady state boundary\nat the open end. The fact that the results in Figures 2 and 6 and Figures 3 and 7 match closely\nis validation that the hybrid method is working correctly. Close inspection of the four figures\nshow that although the two sets of \u03bb values agree perfectly the two sets of \u03b2 values do not.  \nThe \u03bb values are determined solely by the source, which is identified for both calculations so\nthe two sets of \u03bb values should match perfectly.  The two sets of \u03b2 values match perfectly \nonce the hybrid values have converged. The requirement for convergence is due to the use of\nuT in equation (40), where uT requires updated values of both \u03bbT and \u03b2 before it is correct.\nThe imperfect yet close match between the two sets of \u03b2 values occurred because the sound\nwave is at a low frequency (96Hz).\nM.F. Harrison, R. Perez Arenas HYBRID BOUNDARY, Revision 1\n24\nAt low frequencies (Helmholtz number < 0.1) the acoustic reflection coefficient at the open\nunflanged end of the pipe is almost unity [17]. The quasi-steady state open end boundary\n(equation 34) used for the pure mesh method of characteristics calculations reported in\nSection 3.1 implicitly states that the reflection coefficient is unity. In this case the duct\nsimulated had a diameter of 38mm (Figure: 1) so the Helmholtz number is 0.033 at 96Hz. At\nhigher frequencies, say above 300Hz where the Helmholtz number is above 0.1 and the\nacoustic reflection coefficient at the open end becomes significantly less than unity [17], the\ntwo sets of \u03b2 values would differ from each other. Assuming that the hybrid results for \u03b2\nremain correct at high frequencies then those produced using a quasi steady state open-end\nboundary are only correct below about 300Hz for typical intake duct diameters. 300Hz\ncorresponds to only 1.5 times the firing frequency of a 4-cylidner engine running at 6000\nrev\/min-1. As the intake pressure waveform is known to contain components at 3 or more\ntimes the firing frequency [2, 11] it seems that the realism of the quasi steady state open-end\nboundary is reduced at higher engine speeds. It has been found however that the quasi-steady\nstate open boundary can give acceptable results, providing that a frequency varying end\ncorrection is added to the physical pipe length [21, 22]. This is possible when the calculation\ninvolves a sinusoidal waveform but impossible for the general case because no single end\ncorrection would be correct for every frequency component in a (as yet un-converged and\nhence unknown) non-sinusoidal sound wave.\nThis problem may solved by using an extension to the hybrid method discussed so far.\nEquations (30 or 33) are still used along with the time shifting rules but rather than use one\nvalue of \u03b6 (f) as when \u03bb is sinusoidal, the inverse Fourier transform (IFFT) of \u03b6 (f) is used \nwhen \u03bb is non-sinusoidal.\nM.F. Harrison, R. Perez Arenas HYBRID BOUNDARY, Revision 1\n25\n\u03b6 (f) should be calculated at a binary number of frequencies.  The binary number n should be\nlarge enough so that:\nso ffn \uf03e (42)\nwhere fo is the lowest cycle frequency (i.e. the 4-stroke cycle frequency or the lowest\nfrequency input by the source in Figure 1) and:\nx\u0394\na\nf os \uf03d \u2243\nMAXt\u0394\n1\n(43)\nwhere \u2206tMAX is an approximation to the maximum time step allowed in a mesh method of\ncharacteristics with a mesh size \u2206x.  The correct maximum step size is given by:\nua\nx\u0394\u0394t\n\uf02b\n\uf0a3 (44)\n\u03b6 (f) is calculated using linear acoustic theory for the frequency range 0Hz to fs\/2 Hz at\nintervals given by fs\/n. For the case of a 10mm mesh size and a cycle frequency of 50Hz, n =\n1024. This means that calculations are being made at frequencies up to fs\/2 = 28.16kHz.\nThis is obviously well above the plane wave cutoff frequency given by a Helmholtz number\nequal to 1.84 and therefore higher mode waves will be propagating that are not included in\nthe linear acoustic theory employed to calculate \u03b6 (f) [17].  The need to include spurious high \nfrequency results for \u03b6 (f) is an unavoidable limitation of the method.  The effects are \nM.F. Harrison, R. Perez Arenas HYBRID BOUNDARY, Revision 1\n26\nminimised if the reflection coefficient at the open end is made to tend to zero at higher\nfrequencies.\nFor a 4-stroke I.C. engine at 6000 rev\/min, fo = 50Hz. The n + 1 frequency points describing\n\u03be(f) are then transformed into n time points for \u03be(t) by the action of the IFFT.\nThe time marching method of characteristics calculation is performed with\nofn\n1\u0394t \uf03d . In this\nway, n time points are used to calculate one full cycle at the lowest known cycle frequency fo.\nAs the IFFT provides n values for \u03b6 (t), each value in turn can be used in solving equation \n(30) or (33) for the first and any subsequent cycles.  Thus \u03b6 (t) is only calculated once but it \nmay be used several times if more than one cycle is simulated. In the case of an IC engine\nintake system, a new \u03b6 (t) must be calculated if the engine speed is changed (fo changes) or if\nthe engine load changes (the mean inlet Mach number changes and hence \u03be(f) changes [17]).\n4 Results\nThe general test case shown in Figure 1 will be used to test:\n(i) The mesh method of characteristics using a quasi-steady state open-end boundary\n(given by equation (34)).\n(ii) The hybrid method using the mesh method of characteristics coupled with a hybrid\nboundary that is the solution to equation (30) with a sinusoidal \u03bb wave.\nM.F. Harrison, R. Perez Arenas HYBRID BOUNDARY, Revision 1\n27\n(iii) As for (ii) but solving equation (30) iteratively with a non-sinusoidal \u03bb wave.\n(iv) As for (iii) but solving equation (33) directly.\nIn each case, results at the hybrid plane will be reported for a 2Pa input at the source\nmaintained over a 0.045 second period. These will be compared with the results of the linear\nacoustic theory [17], which is known to validate well against experiment for such a case [23,\n24].\nFigure 8 shows how the acoustic pressure ratio calculated at the hybrid plane using linear\nacoustic theory varies with frequency. The acoustic pressure ratio is given by the ratio of\npositive-going and negative-going travelling wave components:\n\uf02b\n\uf02d\uf02b \uf02b\np\npp\nwhere p+ = 1 (45)\nAt resonance, the modulus of the pressure ratio is maximum (96Hz) and it is minimum at\nanti-resonance (192Hz).\nFigure 9 shows the corresponding acoustic particle velocity given by:\noo a\u03c1\npp\nu\n\uf02d\uf02b \uf02d\uf03d (46)\nThis time the modulus of the acoustic particle velocity is a minimum at resonance and a\nmaximum at anti-resonance.\nM.F. Harrison, R. Perez Arenas HYBRID BOUNDARY, Revision 1\n28\nFigure 10 shows the spectrum of specific acoustic impedance ratio \u03b6 (f) given by:\n\uf02b\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\n\uf02b\uf03d\np\np\nR(47)\nR1\nR1\u03b6 (48)\nPeaks in the modulus of \u03b6 (f) correspond to resonances and minima occur at anti-resonances.\nFor each of the four time domain calculation schemes considered here to be realistic, the\nresults for acoustic pressure ratio, acoustic particle velocity and specific acoustic impedance\nratio should all agree with the results obtained from linear acoustic theory.\nFigure 11, 12 and 13 show the results from the pure mesh method of characteristics with the\nquasi steady state boundary given by equation (34). This time acoustic pressure ratio is given\nby:\n\uf05b \uf05d\n\uf05b \uf05dMAXo\no\npp\npp\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n(49)\nand the maximum value of the modulus of p from the last cycle calculated is taken. The\nother two results are given by (25) and (32). All these results agree closely with linear\nacoustic theory although there are some differences around the anti-resonance frequencies.\nFigure 14, 15 and 16 show the corresponding results obtained using equation (30) to solve the\nhybrid boundary with a sinusoidal \u03bb wave.  Again the pressure ratio and particle velocity \nresults agree well, but the specific acoustic impedance ratio obtained is rather low this time.\nThe final value obtained at resonance is found to be very sensitive to the frequency resolution\nM.F. Harrison, R. Perez Arenas HYBRID BOUNDARY, Revision 1\n29\napplied at the source: small changes in the input frequency move the starred point near 96Hz\nquite significantly.\nFigures 17, 18 and 19 show the results obtained by solving equation (30) iteratively with non-\nsinusoidal \u03bb waves.  The pressure ratio results (Figure 17) agree closely with linear acoustic \ntheory but the particle velocity results less so (Figure 18). The agreement is found to depend\non the spectral resolution of \u03b6 (f) and the corresponding number of time points in \u03b6 (t).  The \nagreement between specific acoustic impedance ratio results remains acceptable though.\nFigures 20, 21 and 22 show the results of solving equation (33) directly with non-sinusoidal\nwaves. These results agree completely with those obtained from the solution to equation (30)\nas they should.\n5 Conclusions\nA number of conclusions have been reached in this work.\nFirstly, the quasi-steady state inflow boundary specified in terms of ingoing and outgoing\ncharacteristics that is commonly adopted for engine simulation is correctly specified by using\nthe primitive pair p, \u03c1 but will be unrealistic at frequencies above a Hemholtz number of\naround 0.1 as only stagnation values po, \u03c1o are used. For the case of I.C. engine intake\nsimulations this sets a maximum frequency of around 300Hz. Above that frequency the\nresults obtained will become increasingly unrealistic.\nM.F. Harrison, R. Perez Arenas HYBRID BOUNDARY, Revision 1\n30\nSecondly, a hybrid time and frequency domain boundary has been developed and tested\nagainst linear acoustic theory. This agrees well with results obtained using a quasi-steady\nstate boundary at low frequencies (Helmholtz number less than 0.1), and should remain\nrealistic at higher frequencies in the range of Helmholtz number 0.1 - 1.84.\nThirdly, the cyclic nature of the operation of the IC engine has been exploited to make use of\nthe inverse Fourier transform to develop an analytical hybrid boundary that functions for non-\nsinusoidal waves in ducts. The method is self starting and does not rely on iterations over\ncomplete cycles and is entirely analytical and therefore is an improvement over earlier hybrid\nboundaries.\nAcknowledgements\nThe first author gratefully acknowledges the support of EPSRC for this work made possible\nunder grant No: GR\/R04324.\nM.F.
