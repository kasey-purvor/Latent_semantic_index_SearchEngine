General practices will be randomised to an educational intervention for problem\nfocused therapy which includes a consultation approach comprising careful assessment (using\nassessment of secondary causes, sleep diaries and severity) and use of modified CBTi for insomnia\nin the consultation compared with usual care (general advice on sleep hygiene and\npharmacotherapy with hypnotic drugs). Clinicians randomised to the intervention will receive an\neducational intervention (2 \u00d7 2 hours) to implement a complex intervention of problem focused\ntherapy. Clinicians randomised to the control group will receive reinforcement of usual care with\nPublished: 26 January 2009\nBMC Family Practice 2009, 10:9 doi:10.1186\/1471-2296-10-9\nReceived: 5 January 2009\nAccepted: 26 January 2009\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2296\/10\/9\n\u00a9 2009 Siriwardena et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Family Practice 2009, 10:9 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2296\/10\/9sleep hygiene advice. Outcomes will be assessed via self-completion questionnaires and telephone\ninterviews of patients and staff as well as clinical records for interventions and prescribing.\nDiscussion: Previous studies in adults have shown that psychological treatments for insomnia\nadministered by specialist nurses to groups of patients can be effective within a primary care setting.\nThis will be a pilot study to determine whether an educational intervention aimed at primary care\nteams to deliver problem focused therapy for insomnia can improve sleep management and\noutcomes for individual adult patients presenting to general practice. The study will also test\nprocedures and collect information in preparation for a larger definitive cluster-randomised trial.\nThe study is funded by The Health Foundation.\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov ID ISRCTN55001433 \u2013 http:\/\/www.controlled-trials.com\/\nISRCTN55001433\nBackground\nInsomnia and sleep problems are common, affecting over\na third of adults in the United Kingdom.[1,2] Many of\nthose whose lives are affected seek medical help from pri-\nmary care.[3] A review of cost effectiveness studies of diag-\nnosis and treatment of insomnia highlighted that\ninsomnia has a high economic cost on society, particu-\nlarly in terms of productivity loss and impaired health-\nrelated quality of life.[4]\nGeneral practitioners and nurse prescribers have been\nshown to have a limited repertoire of responses (sleep\nadvice sheet, prescription) when managing new patients\nor reviewing those with insomnia. Clinical responses are\nshaped by unduly positive attitudes towards newer hyp-\nnotics[5] and limited by lack of knowledge of alternative\nnon-pharmacological approaches. This leads to manage-\nment strategies that often involve the prescription of hyp-\nnotic drugs, despite the finding that GPs hold less than\nfavourable views of these drugs overall.[6] Evidence also\nsuggests that hypnotic prescribing fosters patient depend-\nency and passive 'help seeking behaviour' involving fur-\nther requests for prescriptions. The clinical benefits of\nhypnotics are small and short-lived. They also carry signif-\nicant risks of adverse events, for example increases in risk\nof falls, fractures,[7] depression[8], suicide[9] and excess\nmortality.[10] These dangers are particularly pronounced\nin the elderly who are most vulnerable to potential\nharm.[11] A compelling case exists for both improving\nquality of care for these patients and doing so by encour-\naging changes in prescribing, although there is less evi-\ndence about how to achieve these outcomes.\nWe could find no published evidence on the costs of poor\nsleep in the UK. However in the US the costs (direct, indi-\nrect and related) of insomnia have been estimated at\nUS$30 to 35 billion per annum (1994 US$) [12] and in\nAustralia AUS$7494 million (2004 AUS$) of which 53%\nwas accounted for by work-related injuries (net of health\ncosts), private motor vehicle accidents (net of health\ncosts) and productivity losses associated with sleep disor-\nders.[13] The review by Martin et al.[4] made three\nresearch recommendations encompassing the need for\nmore accurate costs for patients with different types of\ninsomnia related diagnosis, an estimate of the health util-\nities associated with particular insomnia diagnoses and\ntheir treatments and finally to undertake cost utility anal-\nyses of treatments for insomnia to encourage resource\nallocation to this area.\nWe have shown in modelling studies involving patients,\npractitioners and practices that despite patients trying var-\nious self-help remedies and sometimes expecting a pre-\nscription when presenting with sleep problems, they also\nwelcome a consultation approach which includes careful\nassessment and advice about non-pharmacological meth-\nods rather than a prescription. [14-16] Practitioners are\ngenerally positive towards finding new approaches that\nenhance their skills in non-pharmacological management\nmethods. Brief psychological\/behavioural methods[17]\nhave also been shown to be effective in one previous lim-\nited evaluation of effectiveness.[18]\nThe objective of this paper is to describe the design of a\npilot cluster randomised controlled study, the aim of\nwhich is to test procedures and collect information in\npreparation for a larger definitive cluster-randomised\ntrial. The definitive study will determine the effectiveness\nand cost-effectiveness of an educational intervention for\ngeneral practitioners, primary care nurses and other mem-\nbers of the primary care team to deliver problem focused\ntherapy to adults patients presenting with sleep distur-\nbance due to primary insomnia or specific comorbid\ninsomnia due to pain or mild to moderate depression and\nanxiety compared to usual care (general advice on sleep\nhygiene and pharmacotherapy).\nThe team includes a general practitioner, psychologist,\npsychiatrist, qualitative researcher, statistician and health\neconomist and a service user representative who havePage 2 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Family Practice 2009, 10:9 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2296\/10\/9worked together undertaking studies of sleep manage-\nment in primary care and have contributed to the ration-\nale and design of this study.\nMethods\nAims\nOur main aim for the pilot study is to test procedures and\ncollect information in preparation for a larger definitive\ncluster-randomised trial. The definitive trial will investi-\ngate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a brief prac-\ntice-based educational intervention (2 \u00d7 2 hours) for\npractice teams (GPs, primary care nurses and practice\nmanagers) to provide problem focused therapy for insom-\nnia in adults involving the use of sleep assessment tools\n(assessed with standardised instruments and sleep dia-\nries) and modified CBTi on sleep outcomes compared to\nusual care (general advice on sleep hygiene and pharma-\ncotherapy). The study will include new patients present-\ning with primary and specific comorbid insomnia as well\nas patients with chronic insomnia on treatment.\nThe research question for the pilot trial is \"How well do\nthe procedures and processes designed for conduct of the\ntrial lead to effective implementation of trial including\nrecruitment, randomisation, intervention, and outcome\nmeasurements.\"\nThe research question for the main trial is as follows \"How\neffective and cost-effective is an educational intervention\nto primary care teams (general practitioners, primary care\nnurses and practice managers) to deliver problem focused\ntherapy to adult patients presenting with sleep problems\ndue to lifestyle causes, pain or mild to moderate depres-\nsion on sleep and quality of life compared with treatment\nas usual including sleep hygiene and pharmacotherapy?\"\nThe primary hypothesis for the main trial to be addressed\nis:\n\"Education for primary care teams in problem focused\ntherapy for patients presenting to primary care with\ninsomnia leads to better sleep outcomes for patients com-\npared to treatment as usual with sleep hygiene up to 3\nmonths from the beginning of treatment.\"\nSecondary hypotheses for the main trial include: \"Educa-\ntion for primary care teams in problem focused therapy\nfor patients presenting to primary care with insomnia\nimproves daytime sleepiness, anxiety and depression,\nhealth-related quality of life and reduces hypnotic use,\nadverse effects and costs compared to treatment as usual\nincluding sleep hygiene.\"\nStudy design\nThis study will be a pilot in preparation for a larger cluster-\nrandomised trial. The purpose of undertaking this pilot\nwill include testing the integrity of study protocol, recruit-\nment and consent issues, outcome selection, data collec-\ntion procedures, the randomisation procedure, and the\nacceptability of the intervention and determining a more\naccurate sample size.\nA flow diagram summarizing recruitment and follow-up\nof physicians and patients is shown in Figure 1. We will\nundertake a pilot cluster randomised controlled trial\n(RCT) in which general practices are the unit of randomi-\nsation and where data will be collected from patients.\nRecruited general medical practices will be randomised to\none of two arms: intervention consisting of education of\nprimary care teams to use Problem Focused Therapy for\ninsomnia comprising sleep assessment tools (sleep diaries\nand Insomnia Severity Index) and modified CBTi\n(mCBTi); or a control arm using treatment as usual (TAU).\nWe will follow the CONSORT statement extension on\nconduct and reporting of cluster randomised controlled\ntrials.[19]\nParticipants\nThe Practices\nWe will recruit four practices from Lincolnshire Teaching\nPrimary Care Trust using EMIS or SystemOne computer\nsystems. Each practice will need to recruit at least 20\npatients, based on the sample size calculation for a defin-\nitive RCT who meet the inclusion criteria in order to\nachieve the estimated sample size of 80 patients. Practices\nwill be randomised to intervention and control groups\nonce the practices have been recruited but allocation will\nbe concealed until after patients have been recruited in\norder to reduce bias in selection and recruitment of\npatients to intervention and control practice.[20] Invita-\ntion letters will be sent out to all practices in Northwest\nLincolnshire (40 practices) inviting participation. Patients\nwill be recruited from practices that agree to participate.\nStudy population\nIntervention and controls patients will include adults\naged 18 years and over with primary or specific secondary\n(comorbid) insomnia having a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality\nIndex (PSQI) of 5 or above and screened by a trial nurse\nfor the following inclusion and exclusion criteria[21].\nInclusion criteria\n1. At least 18 years old.\n2. Difficulty initiating and\/or maintaining sleep for 1\nmonth or more verified by PSQI score of \u22655.\n3. New presentations with insomnia and existing patients\non long term hypnotics, over the counter or complemen-\ntary therapies.\n4. 1\u20133 above and sleep disrupted by painful conditions.Page 3 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Family Practice 2009, 10:9 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2296\/10\/9\nPage 4 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nConsort diagramFigure 1\nConsort diagram.\nBMC Family Practice 2009, 10:9 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2296\/10\/95. 1\u20133 above and depression measured by the Beck\nDepression Inventory (BDI score 11\u201330).\nExclusion criteria\n1.

Inability to consent.\n8. Current participation in another research study.\nParticipant recruitment\nEligible patients will be recruited by the GP, practice nurse\nor self referred (via a poster in the GP waiting room). After\nreading an information leaflet potential participants will\nregister their interest to take part in the trial using a tear-\noff slip (see Figure 2).\nAt least 48 hours after and within 10 working days of reg-\nistering their interest, patients will be telephoned by the\ntrial nurse (this is a practice based nurse trained to recruit\nand consent patients) to explain the study and check\nwhether they still wish to participate. If the patient is inter-\nested the trial nurse will assess the patient against the\nabove listed inclusion and exclusion criteria. Information\nwill be recorded on a standard proforma including, for\npatients either not eligible or not willing to be recruited,\nthe reason for ineligibility or for declining. Patients meet-\ning the criteria will be sent an invitation by post to an ini-\ntial assessment visit together with a copy of the Patient\nInformation Sheet (PIS), consent form and baseline\ndemographic questionnaire.\nWhen the patient attends for the initial assessment a\n(practice based) trial nurse will discuss the PIS with the\npatient and gain informed consent. The PSQI and BDI will\nbe carried out and checked against the inclusion and\nexclusion criteria requirements.\nIf the patient is fully eligible and informed consent is\nobtained the participant will be entered into the trial. The\ntrial nurse will register the patient with the Trial Centre via\na Safehaven fax system. The patient will be allocated a\nunique trial number by the trial centre. The trial nurse will\ninform the patient's GP that they have been entered into\nthe trial. The rest of the baseline assessments will be per-\nformed at this stage (EuroQol EQ-5D, ESS, ISI, Sleep\nDiary, and PSYCHLOPS). An appointment will be made\nfor the GP or practice nurse to begin assessment\/treatment\nwithin 10 working days of the practice being allocated to\neither the intervention or control group or in the interven-\ntion practices, after training of the practice teams on prob-\nlem focused therapy for insomnia.\nRecruitment is planned to take place over 3 months using\nthe methods described above including posters in GP\nwaiting rooms and reminders to GPs and nurses sup-\nported by an information leaflet. During the recruitment\nphase patients will continue to receive treatment as usual.\nRandomisation and allocation concealment\nParticipating practices will be numbered and randomised\nto two groups using a computer-generated list of practice\nidentifiers and these will be passed on to the statistician\n(who will be an investigator remote from the study site)\nblind to the identity of the practices and using random\nnumbers to ensure allocation concealment. The list will\nbe returned to trial staff, who will break the code and\nidentify the practice allocation when patient recruitment\nis complete. This information will not be returned to the\nstatistician (MD) so that he will remain masked to treat-\nment allocation while undertaking the analysis. Because\nof the nature of the study it will not be possible to mask\nthe practices or patients to the intervention but we shall\ntake all possible steps to conduct the analysis masked to\ntreatment.\nIntervention general practices\nThe intervention will consist of two two-hour educational\nsessions, using a previously published model of academic\ndetailing to primary care teams.[22] GPs, practice nurses\nand practice manager will be invited to participate. The\nimportance of all members of the team, including practice\nmanagers being involved is due to the key need, demon-\nstrated in the modelling studies, for management support\nin developing the pathway of care within practices. The\nfirst session will include the background to the study, trial\nstructure and procedures, assessment of sleep problems\nincluding the use of sleep assessment tools and measure-\nments and information on sleep hygiene. The second ses-\nsion will be on the use of problem focused therapy in the\nconsultation which includes careful assessment (using\nassessment of secondary causes, sleep diaries and severity)\nand modified cognitive behavioural therapy for insom-\nnia. This session will also involve practice teams designing\ntheir own pathway for care. The timing and number of\neducational sessions is based on previous modelling stud-\nies with a group of 8 practices.Page 5 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Family Practice 2009, 10:9 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2296\/10\/9\nPage 6 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nParticipant recruitment flowchartFigure 2\nParticipant recruitment flowchart.\nBMC Family Practice 2009, 10:9 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2296\/10\/9Control general practices\nThe control practices will also receive the first session of\ntraining which will include the background to the study,\ntrial structure and procedures, assessment of sleep prob-\nlems including the use of sleep assessment tools and\nmeasurements and information on sleep hygiene. They\nwill continue their usual practice (treatment as usual) sup-\nported by a standard sleep hygiene leaflet. In the UK, treat-\nment as usual consists of advice on sleep hygiene (with or\nwithout a patient information leaflet) and hypnotic phar-\nmacotherapy. We will provide advice on sleep hygiene\nand a sleep hygiene leaflet for control practices. Sleep\nhygiene consists of a good bedtime routine, avoiding alco-\nhol, caffeine and nicotine and ensuring a comfortable\nsleeping environment.\nAudit of interventions and activity\nPrimary care teams in the intervention practices will be\nrequired to send all clinicians and the practice manager to\nthe educational sessions. Further educational sessions will\nbe provided to clinical staff newly recruited during the\nstudy period as the need arises. GPs and nurses in inter-\nvention and control practices will record patients who\npresent with insomnia and their use of sleep assessment\nand problem focused therapy techniques using practice\ncomputer systems. The content and usefulness of training\nwill be assessed using questionnaires to those in receipt of\ntraining. Intervention and control practices will be\naudited on implementation of the educational interven-\ntion by measuring use of assessment and CBTi techniques\nused by undertaking a weekly computer Read codes audit\nof all patients recorded with insomnia as well as asking\npatients through telephone interviews. A sample of up to\n4 patients and practitioners from each practice will be\ninvited for a short telephone interview (20 minutes) to\nunderstand in more depth the interventions that have\nbeen delivered and received as well as perceptions\ntowards these. The interview will determine fidelity to the\nintervention in study practices and contamination in the\ncontrol practices and therefore will not be blinded.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome measure will be global sleep quality\nas measured by PSQI at baseline and at 0, 4, 8 and 13\nweeks.\nSecondary outcomes will be measured at baseline and at\n0,4,8 and 13 weeks and will include the effect of the inter-\nvention on sleep outcome measures assessed with PSQI\nand sleep diaries [23]: self reported Sleep Onset Latency\n(SOL, how long it takes to fall asleep), Wake time After\nSleep Onset (WASO, total hours awake at night after one\nhas fallen asleep), total Time In bed (TIB) and Sleep Effi-\nciency (SE). Sleep Efficiency, expressed as a percentage, is\ncalculated as follows: SE = (100-[(SOL + WASO\/TIB) \u00d7\n100]). Research has shown that these subjective measures\nof sleep reflect subjective treatment-related improve-\nments.\nWe will also measure daytime sleepiness (Epworth sleep-\niness scale),[24] anxiety and depression using the Beck\nDepression Inventory,[25] health-related quality of life\nusing EuroQol EQ-5D,[26] psychological outcome profile\n(PSYCHLOPS)[27] and frequency of use and mean dose\nof hypnotic medication. Patients will also keep a Data\nRecord Book (DRB) to record any adverse effects that they\nmight experience during the treatment period. Cost-effec-\ntiveness will be assessed using the methods below.\nFollow-up\nPrimary and secondary outcomes will be measured using\nthe instruments described at baseline and 0, 4, 8 and 13\nweeks. Follow-up assessments will be performed using a\ntelephone call at 2 weeks after the first treatment and self-\ncompleted postal questionnaires at all other time points.\nNon responders will be telephoned 1 week after mailing\nthe follow-up questionnaire on up to 2 occasions and\nposted a replacement questionnaire with a reminder letter\nif there is still no response at 2 weeks.\nCriteria and procedure for withdrawal of patients from the \ntrial\nA patient may be withdrawn or themselves withdraw from\nthe trial at any time, at his\/her own discretion or at that of\nthe GP or researcher if there is any suspicion of adverse\neffects or an exclusion condition (including loss of capac-\nity to consent) supervening. The reasons for interrupting\nthe patient's participation in the trial will be recorded on\nthe summary page of the Data Record Book (DRB) and\nthe patient ' proforma. His\/her GP will be notified of the\nneed for clinical follow up.\nJustification of sample size\nAssuming an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of\n0.01 we need at least 15 practices per arm and a cluster\nsize of 20 (i.e. 20 patients in each practice) giving 300\npatients per arm to detect a difference of 1 point in the\nPSQI with 90% power for a definitive RCT. This would\nrequire a major investment of resources and therefore we\nwill first conduct an exploratory trial to understand the\nfeasibility of a full trial. For our exploratory trial we will\ntake a pragmatic decision to include 4 practices, 2 inter-\nvention and 2 control practices.\nMethods of data collection\nPatient level data will be collected from patients using\nself-report questionnaires, and researchers by telephone.\nOutcomes will be measured at baseline and at week 0, at\n4 weeks, and at 8 and 13 weeks from the initial treatment\nwhether treatment has been completed or not (i.e. on an\nintention to treat basis).Page 7 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Family Practice 2009, 10:9 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2296\/10\/9Data analysis\nData collection and statistical analysis will be undertaken\non both clustered data and on individual patient data\nmasked to treatment allocation and on an intention to\ntreat basis. Data will be analysed at baseline, at 0, 4, 8 and\n13 weeks. Baseline clinical and demographic data will be\nanalysed for important differences between trial groups.\nComparisons between treatment arms before and after\nintervention will be made using proportions and odds\nratios. We shall analyse the primary outcome using linear\nregression with baseline as a covariate and also control-\nling for other relevant baseline covariates. We shall ana-\nlyse our primary outcome, the PSQI, at the level of the\npatient using a multivariable model which adjusts for\nbaseline PSQI and for the clustering due to practices. We\nshall carry out similar analyses for our secondary out-\ncomes. In addition we shall extend our model to incorpo-\nrate all the time points. This will be a mixed effects model\nwith random effects for time and practice. This model has\nthe advantage that sporadic missing data can be coped\nwith if it is missing at random (MAR). If there is substan-\ntial dropout we shall examine it using a pattern mixture\nmodel which does not have the restriction to MAR. We\nshall conduct analogous analyses for the other secondary\noutcomes. Statistical significance will be set at 5% (two\ntailed) and analysis performed using Stata or other statis-\ntical software. No interim analysis of the primary or sec-\nondary outcomes will be undertaken during the trial\nperiod.\nTemplate analysis will be used to undertake a qualitative\nanalysis of a short telephone interview (20 minutes) to\ninvestigate perceptions of practitioners and patients on\ninterventions delivered and received in each practice with\n4 patients and 4 practitioners from each intervention and\ncontrol practice.\nHealth economic analysis\nSince a cost analysis will be undertaken for the main trial\nand the instruments and methods will be piloted in this\nstudy, the rationale and methods are therefore described\nbelow. Given the high cost of insomnia and the need for\neconomic research in this area, the economic evaluation\nfor the main study will estimate the cost-utility of a brief\neducational intervention for primary care teams (GPs,\nnurses and practice managers) to improve sleep manage-\nment using problem focused therapy (including CBTi)\ncompared to usual care provided by GPs and nurses from\na health and social care perspective in the base case. The\nwider costs will be captured separately. Established and\naccepted economic methodologies will be employed\nthroughout.[28,29]\nResource items likely to change as a result of the interven-\ntion (as well as the cost of developing and providing the\neducational intervention) will be identified, measured\nand valued drawing upon instruments used in other stud-\nies and available from published resources.[30] The base\ncase will capture only those costs incurred by the NHS and\nsocial care (including, for instance, patient visits to health\nand social care professionals, outpatient visits and admis-\nsions to secondary care, and medication) using patient\nlevel data extracted from self completion questionnaires\nadministered at baseline, 0, 8 and 13 weeks. This will\ninclude all health and social care resource use (due to the\ndifficulties of disentangling) which are consumed as a\nresult of sleep problems per se rather than because of\nother causes. Where feasible the wider costs associated\nwith sleep problems will be monitored through patient\nquestionnaires, in particular we will attempt to estimate\npatient costs, particularly associated with health care\nusage (for instance, over the counter medication and\ntravel costs) and the productivity costs (both absenteeism\nand presenteeism) [31,32] of patients, whether due\ndirectly to sleep problems or accidents, to see if the inter-\nvention has any impact on the patient's wider well-being.\nUnit costs will be derived from national published data\n(for instance, NHS reference costs,.[33] Annual Survey of\nHours and Earnings (ASHE)) for the most recent price\nyear available or local unit costs will be estimated where\nappropriate and feasible.\nThis study will undertake cost-effectiveness and cost util-\nity analyses. Both types of analyses enable technical effi-\nciency questions to be addressed, that is to ask, is an\neducational intervention for health professionals a cost\neffective way in which to improve the management of\npatients with sleep problems? In addition, cost-utility\nanalysis will also enable allocative efficiency questions to\nbe addressed within the health sector, for instance, is the\nbrief educational intervention about CBTi considered in\nthis study cost-effective compared to a diverse range of\nother health interventions or services? This study will esti-\nmate the cost-effectiveness in terms of cost per 1 point\nchange on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and\nthe cost utility using the EuroQol EQ-5D http:\/\/\nwww.euroqol.org[26] to estimate the cost per QALY over\nthe trial period. Both outcome instruments will be admin-\nistered at baseline and 13 weeks to observe if change\noccurs as a result of the intervention and whether it is sus-\ntained.\nThe timeframe for the economic analysis will be that of\nthe trial period. The change in costs will be divided by the\nchange in effectiveness in order to estimate the cost effec-\ntiveness of the brief educational intervention compared to\nno brief educational intervention for health professionals.\nIf non-dominance occurs (that is if costs are greater and\nthe intervention is more effective or if the intervention is\ncheaper and less effective) an incremental cost-effective-Page 8 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Family Practice 2009, 10:9 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2296\/10\/9ness ratio (the ratio of change in cost divided by change in\nbenefit) will be produced. The confidence region around\nthe incremental cost effectiveness ratio will be estimated\nusing appropriate statistical techniques. Since this eco-\nnomic evaluation is being undertaken alongside a cluster\nrandomised trial the analysis needs to reflect the increased\nuncertainty of randomising clusters rather than individu-\nals, a number of approaches have recently been proposed\neach found to generate similar findings.[34] The stochas-\ntic analysis will enable a cost effectiveness acceptability\ncurve to be produced [35] illustrating the decision uncer-\ntainty, that is the probability that the brief educational\nintervention for health professionals on improving sleep\nmanagement is cost-effective compared to no educational\nintervention\/usual care for a range of willingness to pay\nper QALY values.\nEthical approval\nThe study has been approved by the National Research\nEthics Service (REC reference number: 08\/H0401\/89) and\nNHS Lincolnshire (Trent) Research Governance. All data\nwill be stored confidentially in encrypted files. Practices\nwill give informed written consent and individual patient\nconsent will also be needed. Data will be kept securely for\n13 years.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nThe objective of this study is to test the procedures for a\ndefinite trial investigating the effectiveness and cost-effec-\ntiveness of an educational intervention for general practi-\ntioners, primary care nurses and other members of the\nprimary care team to deliver problem focused therapy to\nadult patients presenting with sleep problems and anxiety\ncompared with usual care (general advice on sleep\nhygiene and\/or sleeping tablets). Problem focused ther-\napy includes a consultation approach comprising careful\nassessment (using assessment of secondary causes, sleep\ndiaries and severity) and the use of modified CBTi for\ninsomnia.\nThis trial is designed to test procedures and collect data in\npreparation for a larger definitive cluster-randomised trial\nwhich will investigate the effectiveness and cost-effective-\nness of a brief practice-based educational intervention (2\n\u00d7 2 hours) for practice teams (GPs, primary care nurses\nand practice managers) to provide problem focused ther-\napy for adults presenting with sleep problems in primary\ncare due to lifestyle causes, pain or mild to moderate\ndepression. It will include new patients presenting with\nprimary and specific comorbid insomnia as well as\npatients with chronic insomnia on treatment.\nThe intervention was developed using the theoretical and\nmodelling phases of the Medical Research Council Frame-\nwork for complex interventions.[36,37] We are conduct-\ning this trial in a primary care population using a team\nbased educational intervention which has been used pre-\nviously.[22]\nThis trial will form the basis of a definitive cluster trial of\na carefully modelled psychological intervention for\npatients presenting with sleep problems to be managed in\na primary care setting. If problem focused therapy is effec-\ntive and safe when delivered by primary care clinicians\nthis will have a potential impact for sufferers who are\noften inappropriately prescribed drugs long term with evi-\ndence of more harm than benefit in the elderly. The study\nwould have the potential of providing evidence to\nimprove management of insomnia for a large number of\nsufferers and thereby to improve the well-being, mental\nand physical health of many people with sleep problems.\nIf a definitive trial shows that such an intervention is effec-\ntive and cost-effective this would provide valuable infor-\nmation to general practitioners, mental health trusts and\ncommissioners for provision of such services. If the treat-\nment is shown to be ineffective or costly then this will also\nprovide valuable information about whether such treat-\nment should be provided.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nANS led the grant-writing group.
