Abbas Kiarostami, France\/\nIran, 1994). Courtesy Artifi cial Eye\nThis article addresses the entwined issues of gendered and cul-\ntural representation in contemporary Iranian cinema. One of the \nremarkable features of recent Iranian film is its allegorical use of \ngendered tropes, in particular the (in)visibility and (im)mobility \nof women in social space. The female body, which has been \ndefined in historically charged and culturally assertive terms, is \nconstantly reinvested thematically and technically. In Iran, as in \nmore conventionally \u201cpostcolonial\u201d sites of knowledge produc-\ntion,1 the relationship between vision and embodied, gendered \nobjects is both culturally specific and informed by cross-cultural \nencounter. This article urges continued attention to the import of \nfemale representation in relation to a film\u2019s reception both within \nand outside of the national viewing context.\nI assess the implications of verisimilitude in three films: \nAbbas Kiarostami\u2019s Through the Olive Trees (Zire darakhatan zeyton) \n(France\/Iran, 1994), Samira Makhmalbaf\u2019s The Apple (Sib) (Iran\/\nFrance, 1998), and Kim Longinotto and Ziba Mir-Hosseini\u2019s \nWomen in a Widening Frame: \n(Cross-)Cultural Projection, \nSpectatorship, and Iranian Cinema\nLindsey Moore\nCopyright \u00a9 2005 by Camera Obscura\nCamera Obscura 59, Volume 20, Number 2\nPublished by Duke University Press\n1\nDivorce Iranian Style (UK, 1998). The difficulty in generically \ncategorizing these films, particularly the latter two, rests on the \nexploitation in each case of the hinge between documentary and \ndramatic technique. It is my intention not only to contextualize \nthis strategy in relation to postrevolutionary Iranian cultural \npolitics, but to investigate the effects of generically hybrid texts \nthat enter the international sphere. As Laura Mulvey suggests, the \nmodishness of contemporary Iranian cinema is partly due to its \nmasterful treatment of the fact that \u201ccinema is \u2018about\u2019 seeing and \nthe construction of the visible by filmic convention.\u201d2 Given that \nany encounter between Iran and \u201cthe West\u201d carries an ideological \ncharge, however,3 the political valence of representation remains \nmore precarious than an explicit demarcation of the distance \nbetween signifier and referent would resolve. This article demon-\nstrates Mulvey\u2019s assertion but presses upon the issue of woman as \nthe perennial bearer of filmic and national or cultural meaning. \nI argue that, once subjected to a cross-cultural viewing dynamic, \nIranian women on screen continue to signify ethnographically as \nthe \u201calways already known.\u201d Trinh T. Minh-ha\u2019s pithy formulation \nthat \u201cthere is no such thing as documentary\u201d4 enables us to trou-\nble the epistemological comfort zone of non-Iranian spectators \n(such as myself), but also to assess the representational strategies \nthat shape the film text at the point of its origin. Thus I reconsider \nthe relationship between film and the phenomenal, particularly \nin cross-cultural viewing contexts.\nKiarostami\u2019s Through the Olive Trees opens, before the credits, with \nthe self-introduction (addressed to the camera) of Mohamed Ali \nKeshawarz, the actor who plays the director, followed by his \nattempt to select, from a crowd of young veiled women, a female \nprotagonist for the film-within-a-film, which is the embedded nar-\nrative of Olive Trees.5 The scene combines panning and close-up \nshots on the women\u2019s faces as they intone their names and (lack \nof) addresses. Olive Trees is the third installment in a trilogy based \nthematically on the devastating earthquake of 1991 in Roudbar, \nnorth of Tehran.6 (Subsequently, the voice of a male character\u2014\nwhose identity is not revealed\u2014makes an intratextual reference \n2 \u2022 Camera Obscura\nWomen in a Widening Frame \u2022 3\nto the first film and comments ambiguously that he does not \nlike cinema or art, \u201cbut because of the earthquake.\u201d It is unclear \nwhether he chooses to participate in the film and, if so, whether \nhis decision is motivated financially or by the desirability of repre-\nsenting the event to the outside world.) The opening scene, which \nfunctions as mise en abyme to denote the processes of the film as \na whole, foregrounds the haggling agency of the young women.7 \nAfter Mrs. Shiva (Zarifeh Shiva), the director\u2019s assistant, inter-\nrupts his posturing with the pragmatic reminder of the need to \nhurry up as the \u201cgirls are hungry,\u201d the movement of the director \nand camera through the crowd emphasizes the individual iden-\ntities of the identically dressed and veiled respondents. It then \nincorporates a reversed perspective. The director, now the object \nof scrutiny, is challenged by the girls, who refuse to stay in orderly \nlines. They ask, \u201cWhere will you show it? You\u2019re filming us. . . . Oh, \nwhat does it matter?\u201d and then accuse him, \u201cYou won\u2019t show it. \nAre you going to show it to us? Your last film went out on Channel \n2, which we can\u2019t get here. Why bother?\u201d Eventually they decide, \nhowever, \u201cWe film! But you\u2019ll have to show it!\u201d\nKiarostami\u2019s films typically feature multiple focalization, a \nblurring of the line between fictional events and characters and \nthose \u201cdrawn from life,\u201d and the reflexive framing of films within \nfilms, all in order to sustain a resistant perspective on the process \nof filmmaking. Rather than being purely formalist strategies, these \ntechniques can be understood as an engaged commentary on the \nact of viewing; in the scene just discussed, issues of who and what \nis filmed and who gets to watch are considered not only intrinsic \nto the finished product but also open to negotiation by the par-\nticipants. As such, it demonstrates the mutual influence of textual \nand public realms and foregrounds the Kiarostami credo: \u201cWe are \nnever able to reconstruct truth. . . . So if we distance the audience \nfrom the film and even film from itself,\u201d the audience is reminded \nthat \u201cwe are reconstructing reality.\u201d Kiarostami believes that \u201cit is \nthe audience who should seek the answer\u201d to any text and that, by \ninsisting upon defamiliarization, \u201ccinema and all the arts ought to \nbe able to destroy the mind of their audience in order to reject the \nold values and make it susceptible to new values.\u201d8\nSome commentators have challenged Kiarostami\u2019s \nmetatextual and self-reflexive propensities. Azadeh Farahmand, \nfor example, cites a minimal use of female characters as evidence \nof Kiarostami\u2019s \u201cpolitical escapism [that is] a facilitating, rather \nthan a debilitating, choice, one which caters to the film festi-\nval taste for high art and restrained politics.\u201d Through the use \nof mediating characters and rural landscapes, \u201cthe viewer can \nmaintain his [sic] distance and remain uninvolved, be fascinated, \nsecurely appreciative.\u201d9 As Trinh points out, if films are seen only \nas artificial constructs, then the social interactions and practices \nrepresented remain \u201cframed\u201d or resistant to political challenge.10 \nHowever, in foregrounding the way Kiarostami reflects an inter-\nnational taste for \u201cexotic\u201d landscapes, Farahmand overlooks his \nequally insistent focus on communities in transition as a result of \nthe forces of nature and modernity. She also underestimates the \nextent to which, as Negar Mottahedeh points out, subversion is \nwritten into the fabric of Kiarostami\u2019s films, which encourage the \nspectator to imagine what lies outside the frame or is not ascer-\ntainable to the gaze\u2014hence to question accepted limits of repre-\nsentation.11\nAn analysis of the thematic and specular focus on women \nin Through the Olive Trees productively troubles Farahmand\u2019s cri-\ntique. The film suggests that women manipulate visual codes and \nstrategically use silence in a complex and variable relationship to \nboth social and representational practices. The fact that the film \nbegins with close-ups on women\u2019s faces in 1994 is, given the ideo-\nlogical context I discuss below, a relatively radical gesture. More-\nover, the scene opens onto a film that is thematically and structur-\nally concerned with the ways female perspectives on events exceed \nthe filter of the male, intradiegetic fi lmmaker. This is discreetly \nsignaled in the driving scene subsequent to the credits. The cam-\nera, facing outward from the dashboard, aligns the spectator\u2019s \nperspective with that of Mrs. Shiva and deflects our engagement \nwith that character from her face to her voice. Infrequent reverse \nshots focus obliquely, via the car\u2019s side mirror, on the faces of \nthose who speak to her, including some young boys. This ten-\ndency to defer spectatorial satisfaction is replicated in relation to \n4 \u2022 Camera Obscura\nWomen in a Widening Frame \u2022 5\nthe female love interest, Tahereh (Tahereh Ladanian), who plays \nthe wife in the embedded narrative of Hossein (Hossein Rezai), \nher frustrated suitor in the \u201creal life\u201d framing narrative. Tahereh \nrefuses to return either the gaze or conversational overtures of \nHossein; indeed, she assents to complete the dialogue between \nthem required by the \u201cfictional\u201d script only when threatened with \nthe loss of her part. Her constantly averted face and determined \nsilence exacerbate Hossein\u2019s yearning as well as viewer curiosity; \nthe film is ultimately about Tahereh because both she and her \nresponse to the events unfolding about her remain enigmatic.\nMary Ann Doane has memorably theorized the function \nof veiling mechanisms in enhancing women\u2019s desirability as screen \nfetishes, arguing that a supplementary surface over the face \u201cfunc-\ntions to hide an absence\u201d\u2014castration or (lack of) truth\u2014and \nsignifies \u201ca dangerous deception of duplicity attached to the femi-\nnine.\u201d Doane, however, indicates that her approach is restricted to \nthe trope of the veil in Western discourse, a caveat that is applica-\nble here.12 Tahereh\u2019s strategic elusiveness is not intended to mystify \nand hence eroticize the figure of \u201cwoman.\u201d Rather it represents a \ntrenchant assertion of Tahereh\u2019s right to choose her own suitor \nrather than to be pursued. Her oft-mentioned stubbornness and \nsense of self-worth rest on her self-fashioning as literate, educated, \nand modern; similarly, she resists wearing the costume assigned \nto her on the grounds that \u201cshe\u2019s a student, not an illiterate peas-\nant\u201d and \u201cno one wears dresses like that anymore.\u201d It is notewor-\nthy that, with one exception, she refuses to return the look of Hos-\nsein and the spectator because she is reading. The potential of the \ncrowd at the start of the film to assert agency through a command \nof the word and to assert the right to see rather than be observed \nis thus realized through the female protagonist. Her elusiveness \ndoes propel the narrative by exacerbating a desire for romantic \nclosure, but this, too, is ambiguously realized. The final scene cul-\nminates in an extreme long shot in real time in which Hossein fol-\nlows Tahereh into the distance and then begins to return alone. \nDoes she maintain her aloofness, or is he returning to tell the film \ncrew of his success? This final scene exceeds the perspective of the \nhomodiegetic film narrator and thus our own.\nAlthough the means are fictional, Kiarostami\u2019s crowd of \nveiled women, Mrs. Shiva, and Tahereh function as agents in a \nrich and complex filmic history, which, since 1979, has been cen-\ntrally concerned with female representation. Through the Olive Trees \ndemonstrates an internalized sensitivity to gendered codes that \nhas necessitated a strategic reconsideration of the implications of \nthe viewing act per se.\nFrom its inception, the content of Iranian cinema has \nbeen strongly influenced by a dominant national political ideol-\nogy. Since the Iranian Revolution of 1979, as in the Pahlavi era, \nthe state has censored political dissent and provided financial sup-\nport for films that positively reflect government policy.13 Iranian \ncinema\u2019s greatest crisis came in the buildup to the revolution, \nwhen the clergy defined film as an agent of cultural colonization, \nand arson attacks were made on cinemas throughout the coun-\ntry. The industry was resurrected, however, because the Islamic \nstate recognized its value in transmitting both ideology within \nIran and a more benevolent national image beyond its boundaries \nto offset the negative stereotypes produced through the Salman \nRushdie affair and the hostage crisis of 1979\u201380. The number of \npostrevolutionary films screened at foreign festivals increased dra-\nmatically, from 2 in 1986 to 230 (of which 11 garnered awards) in \n1990. However, Iranian cinema has thus far not proved itself to be \nviable economically without foreign markets and, in many cases, \ncofunding. Moreover, as Hamid Naficy observes, the striking suc-\ncess of contemporary Iranian cinema has not mapped back onto \na commensurate improvement in the international profile of its \ngovernment.14\nSubject matter is scrutinized in a tiered censorship sys-\ntem monitored by the production and distribution house Farabi \nCinema Foundation under the Ministry of Culture and Islamic \nGuidance (Ershad). The most recent trend in the industry is a \nrelaxation of controls, due in part to the challenges to censorship \nposed by new technologies (video, DVD, and satellite), but also \nto relative liberalization under Hojjatoleslam Mohammad Khat-\nami (minister of culture and Islamic guidance until 1992 and \npresident of the republic since 1997). Reflecting ongoing political \ndebate and the inconsistent application of ambiguous rules, cin-\n6 \u2022 Camera Obscura\nWomen in a Widening Frame \u2022 7\nema and related technologies exist within what Nafi cy describes \nas \u201ca fluid cultural space in which all kinds of slippage and trans-\ngressions, as well as countermeasures, are possible\u201d (55). More-\nover, Iranians in exile, who form a politically and ideologically \nvaried group but tend to be opposed to the conservative faction \nof the regime, contribute enormously to the total output of that \nwhich is categorized as Iranian cinema.\nIn the case of films produced within the country, all \ngendered representations and interactions are considered sus-\npect. According to regulations imposed in 1982, women in Iran \nmust be visibly chaste. As justified officially by their social status, \nexemplified by but not limited to the raising of children as respon-\nsible Muslim citizens, women must not be treated as commodities \nor sexual objects.15 Landmark regulations approved in June 1982 \nreflected the official Islamization of the cinema and led to a pre-\ncise stipulation, early the next year, of the female imagery allowed \non film, including the wearing of hijab (modest dress) at all times \nto cover all parts of the body except the face and hands. Close-ups \non a woman\u2019s face, any sexual connotation, and all physical contact \nbetween men and women were prohibited, and severe constraints \nwere laid upon other forms of cross-gender communication.\nThis background of representational containment serves \nto contextualize Through the Olive Trees. It also illustrates Naficy\u2019s \nargument that Iranian official discourse rests on an \u201cinjection \ntheory\u201d of cinematic power, in which the line between reality and \nrepresentation is assumed to be permeable and unmediated (44\u2013\n45). As such, images of unveiled women are thought to contribute \nto the moral corruption of men and greater society. Iran\u2019s history \nof imperialist domination is explicitly harnessed to underlying \nassumptions about threatening female sexual presence.16 Afsaneh \nNajmabadi explains that, in the buildup to the revolution, the \n\u201cgharbzadeh [\u2018westoxicated\u2019] woman came to embody at once all \nsocial ills: she was a super-consumer of imperialist\/dependent\u2013\ncapitalist\/foreign goods; she was a propagator of the corrupt cul-\nture of the West; she was undermining the moral fabric of society; \nshe was a parasite, beyond any type of redemption.\u201d17 By contrast, \nconcealed and thus \u201ccured\u201d female bodies became a conduit for \nnotions of communal purity and therefore subject to social sur-\nveillance. \u201cWarrior brother\u201d and \u201cveiled sister\u201d were complemen-\ntary and officially sanctioned gendered identities, which emerged \nwithin revolutionary society, symbolizing persistent militancy, eth-\nnoreligious pride, and asceticism.18 Thus the Iranian chador (black \nhead and body cover) was dialectically reconceived in 1979, as \nwas the Algerian ha\u00efk in the Algerian War of Independence from \nFrance (1954\u201362), in terms of resistance to colonial or imperial \ncontrol. Although Iranian women were construed as active play-\ners, their role was sternly defined by symbolic parameters that \nparadoxically defined women sartorially, and hence corporeally.\nHowever, the most common sign of revolutionary partici-\npation, the chador, emerged alongside other politically nuanced \nforms of veiling that disappeared from the postrevolutionary \nscene. The term hijab has subsequently come to replace chador, \nnot only in Iran but also as a transnational term for \u201cIslamic veil.\u201d \nAnne-Emanuelle Berger observes that this \u201cdiscursive shift points \nto the successful reclaiming of the national revolution in Iran by a \ntransnational pan-Islamic movement.\u201d19 Hijab thus signifies a com-\nplex, contemporary relationship between local culture and trans-\nnational, politicized religious practice. Nevertheless, specifically \nPersian\/Iranian (as distinct from Muslim or Islamist) cultural \ncharacteristics remain pertinent to the context under discus-\nsion. Naficy proposes a dominant etiology of the self in which an \ninner, reliable, stable \u201ccore\u201d is separated from an outer, variable, \nunreliable, and easily influenced \u201cshell.\u201d A \u201cboundary zone, veil \nor screen\u201d protects the core from contamination and from \u201cleak-\ning\u201d to the outside or being revealed. Defensive strategies such as \ndissimulation, evasion, masquerade, and ritual courtesy are the \nsocial norm. Naficy concludes that veiling \u201cis operative within the \nself\u201d and so \u201cis pervasive within [Iranian] culture,\u201d a point astutely \nmade in Kiarostami\u2019s representation of the enigmatic Tahereh.20\nPrivate and public spaces are similarly mapped by binary \ncodes that include lawful\/forbidden contact (related to rules of \nkin). Naficy comments that veiling as a social practice is never \n\u201cfixed or unidirectional\u201d but that both women and men \u201csee and \norganize the field of vision of the other\u201d (50). He elaborates:\n8 \u2022 Camera Obscura\nWomen in a Widening Frame \u2022 9\nFor every stratagem of veiling . . . there is one that violates it or plays \nwith it, turning the veil not only into a powerful semiotic and political \nicon, but also into a dynamic instrument of power, sexuality and \ntransgression. . . . Walls and veils may segregate people but . . . they tend \nto provoke curiosity and to offer visual pleasure by exhibitionism and \nvoyeurism. . . . By playing with the veil, [women] create the necessary \ndistance that promotes scopophilia (pleasurable looking). At the same \ntime, these strategies turn them, as the subjects of scopophilia, into \nerotic objects, thus, ironically, subverting the rules of modesty and the \nreligious \u2018commandments of looking\u2019, which are designed to prevent \nwomen from becoming sexual objects.21\nNaficy\u2019s description of ways that the veil can be wielded to manip-\nulate and control voyeurism and exhibitionism suggests not only \nthat women are the predominant objects of the gaze but that \nthis is a position they encourage. As we have seen, Kiarostami\u2019s \nThrough the Olive Trees encodes multiple modes of looking but dis-\nseminates the agency of the look to men and women, subverting \nan economy that would link vision, either within the film or by the \nspectator, with the promise of satisfaction. Moreover, if interac-\ntion between men and women is regulated by a culturally specific \nSymbolic, this has significant social variations and is constantly \nrenegotiated.22 If we read Mohamed Ali Keshawarz of Olive Trees \nas a fictional stand-in for Kiarostami, then the former\u2019s cosmopol-\nitan ignorance of the local custom of withholding women\u2019s names \nfrom all but their nearest kin may be an ironic comment on the \ndifficulties of representing \u201cIranian\u201d reality.\nRevolutionary discourse itself was not univocal. Ali Shariati, \nan important intellectual mouthpiece for the revolution, had pro-\nmoted the figure of Fatemeh, the Prophet Mohammad\u2019s daugh-\nter, as an alternative to the problematic model of the \u201cwestoxified \nwoman.\u201d But revolutionary women, eventually hailing from the \nentire social spectrum, politicized the figure of Zeynab, Fatemeh\u2019s \ndaughter, as the archetype of women\u2019s militancy rather than piety. \nThat the voluntary donning of the chador was strategic and con-\ntingent is indicated by the fact that, once the Shah had fled the \ncountry in early 1979, women removed what had been predomi-\nnantly an anti-Pahlavi symbol. As Naghibi argues, this did not pre-\nvent a series of repressive veiling measures being legislated in the \nimmediate aftermath of the revolution, culminating in the Veiling \nAct of 1983 (565\u201366). This has been, at times, violently enforced, \noften by female agents (as referenced in Tahmineh Milani\u2019s film \nTwo Women [Do Zan] [Iran, 1999] when a female vigilante on the \nstreets of Tehran hectors the female protagonists to cover their \nhair properly).23\nThe imposition of hijab, signifying in terms of social organi-\nzation as well as sartorially, has politicized women\u2019s presence in the \ncinema industry. Films in the early 1980s were characterized by the \ncutting or blocking of images of unveiled women and by a pervasive \nabsence of female characters. The mid-eighties saw the \u201cpale pres-\nence\u201d of women as background figures, filmed in long shot and pas-\nsive roles. Since the late 1980s, however, women have had a more \ndramatic presence in both diegetic and directorial roles.24 Com-\nmentators affirm, against the prevailing Western stereotype, that \nIranian women are now massively visible in every aspect of Iranian \nlife. The increase in the number of female directors of major popu-\nlar and art-house films since the late eighties is, to some extent, a \nresult of the incorporation of hijab in production contexts (witness \nKiarostami\u2019s Mrs. Shiva as a fictional example). As Ziba Mir-Hosseini \nexplains, \u201cParadoxically, the enforcement of hejab became a cata-\nlyst: by making public space more morally correct in the eyes of tra-\nditionalist families, it legitimized women\u2019s public presence.\u201d25\nIn this context, Jaafar Panahi\u2019s The Circle (Dayereh) (Iran\/\nSwitzerland\/Italy, 2000) sounds a warning note. The film follows \na group of escaped female prisoners around Tehran, emphasiz-\ning their frustrated attempts at invisibility and flight from the city. \nThe women\u2019s unexplained criminal statuses are extended alle-\ngorically to enable a broader expos\u00e9 of authoritarian surveillance \nmechanisms and social practices in which men must officially \naccount for women\u2019s presences. In frequent scenes, the women \ncover their faces with the chador in order to achieve anonymity \nwithin the crowd and thus to avoid the police who seem to lurk \nat every corner. However, anonymity is decoupled from agency. \nBecause female students cannot take public transport out of the \ncity without the permission of a husband or father, one of the \ncentral characters, Nargess (Nargess Mamizadeh), fails to realize \n10 \u2022 Camera Obscura\nWomen in a Widening Frame \u2022 11\nJaafar Panahi\u2019s The Circle (Dayereh) (Iran\/Switzerland\/Italy, \n2000). Courtesy Artifi cial Eye\nher dream of escape to the countryside. She eventually obtains a \nticket out of town but is too fearful to board the bus. Panahi uses \nbird\u2019s-eye perspectives, confined spaces, and a circling camera to \nemphasize the claustrophobic psychogeography of the bus station, \nin which passages and staircases lead nowhere, doors are barred, \nand police are pervasive. This exposure of the effective internal-\nization of social surveillance debunks both Naficy\u2019s erotics of the \nfrustrated gaze and assumptions that hijab equates to unmediated \nfemale public presence.\nIn relation to the presentation of women on-screen, the \nrules of hijab dictate a constant awareness of two spectator posi-\ntions, that of the audience member (as unrelated to the woman \non the screen) and that of the male character (who, even if related \ndiegetically, is constrained by extradiegetic codes of viewing con-\nduct). This necessitates new strategies for enacting gendered inter-\nplay and, by extension, maintaining plot and character credibility. \nIn Rakhshan Bani-Etemad\u2019s The May Lady (Banoo-Ye Ordibehest) \n(Iran, 1998), for example, the female lead veils in front of her son \nbecause the actors are not related, which undercuts the diegetic \nfamily relationship. The same film, however, both parodies and \ntranscends visual taboos. When the son gives his mother, Forugh, \na pair of earrings, she puts them on under her headscarf and asks, \nrather farcically, how they look. Forugh manages to conduct a \nromantic relationship with a doctor on the telephone in which, \nalthough the lovers are never seen on-screen together, allusions \nand nuances push the boundaries of officially defined propriety. \nThis technique undermines the efficacy of patrolling gendered, \nvisual interaction by foregrounding an alternative erotic dynamic \nof speaking and listening.26\nWhile it is necessary to problematize a relationship between \npolitical repression and artistic creativity, it is clear that the close \nmonitoring of images has had some practical benefits for the \nnational film industry, not least through the severe restrictions \nplaced on imported films. The banning of song, dance, and sex-\nual reference, formerly the staples of Film Farsi, has contributed to \nthe flourishing of art-house cinema.27 Milani\u2019s immensely popular \nfilms, in which feminist themes resonate through melodramatic \nplots, suggest the potential for, but also dangers of, crossover \ngenres. In August 2001, Milani was jailed on the premise that her \nlatest film, The Hidden Half (Nimeh-ye penhan) (Iran, 2001)\u2014which \ndeals openly with the social legacies of the 1979 Revolution and \nportrays aggressive and sexually confident women\u2014was coun-\nterrevolutionary and un-Islamic. The film had been approved \nby Ershad and screened to sold-out audiences in Tehran until \nits removal after one month.28 The script for Two Women, com-\npleted in 1991, was not approved for years on the (erroneous) \ngrounds that it unsympathetically portrays men. Milani exploits \nthe binary notion of the self as privately conceived and publicly \nmonitored in this film. She employs alter-ego characters in order \nto illustrate the range of choices potentially available to women.29 \nFereshteh (Niki Karimi), whose name means \u201cangel\u201d in Persian, \nis unable to rebel and seek a fulfilling relationship with a man \nas an equal, as her friend Roya (Marila Zare\u2019i) does. Ironically, \nthe well-behaved Fereshteh becomes the target of a stalker, whose \nintrusive look extends to violence when he jealously throws acid at \nFereshteh\u2019s cousin\u2019s face, assuming him to be her boyfriend. The \nincident is richly allusive, suggesting that female desire is active \nand specular but inherently excessive. Even Kiarostami\u2019s Hos-\nsein accuses Tahereh of leading him on with \u201ca look,\u201d an asser-\n12 \u2022 Camera Obscura\nWomen in a Widening Frame \u2022 13\ntion that is not, however, confirmed within the diegesis. Mohsen \nMakhmalbaf\u2019s Gabbeh (Iran\/France, 1996) is organized around \nthe yearning gaze of the eponymous heroine for her distant or \nmythically projected lover. (He is \u201clike an illusion,\u201d in her words.) \nThe film employs the frustrated desire of its heroine to comment \nallegorically on social hierarchies and restriction. The lover thus \nsymbolizes escape from a system in which Gabbeh\u2019s needs are con-\nstantly frustrated by the priorities and hierarchies of the clan (her \nfather\u2019s return from the city, her grandmother\u2019s death, her uncle\u2019s \nwedding, and her mother\u2019s pregnancy). Gabbeh was banned in Iran \nuntil early 1997 due to the emphasis, in this seemingly innocuous \nfilm, on female desire, despite the fact that the two characters are \nnot shown in the same frame until they depart on horseback near \nthe end of the film\u2014and then only in long shot.\nWhile Milani has achieved notoriety outside Iran due to \nher arrest, neither her work nor that of Rakhshan Bani-Etemad, \nIran\u2019s foremost documentarist of urban life, is well known interna-\ntionally. Farahmand usefully emphasizes the socioeconomic and \ninstitutional factors that have led to the celebrity status and self-\nreflexive styles of directors such as Kiarostami and the Makhmal-\nbaf family. Many Iranian directors actively target the international \nmarket; the fact that Kiarostami films screen earlier and more \ncommercially successfully abroad than in Iran is obliquely alluded \nto in the demands of the young women at the start of the film that \nthey should constitute its primary audience.30 Hadani Ditmars, \ndrawing on a roundtable discussion at the 1997 Fajr Film Festi-\nval in Tehran, proffers a summary and critique of the ongoing \ndebate over audience-oriented content: \u201cThere\u2019s a vast difference \nbetween what the Iranian public likes to watch and what European \nart festivals screen. . . . Certain less well-known Iranian film-mak-\ners in the audience complained that the directors famous in the \nwest pander to European tastes and don\u2019t show authentic Iranian \nreality. But how does one define Iranian reality, which is so much \nless monolithic than either American political propagandists or \nIslamic Revolutionary apologists pretend?\u201d31 The cited recourse \nto authenticity and the objection to superficial images of Iran may \nappear somewhat at odds with Naficy\u2019s model of a Persian \u201ccore\u201d \nself that must remain concealed. To map a psychosocial etiology \nonto the function of a nationalist imago, however, would be to \nconflate analytical categories. Stuart Hall\u2019s suggestion that postco-\nlonial representational work tends to \u201ckeep these two ends of the \nchain in play at the same time\u2014over-determination and differ-\nence, condensation and dissemination\u201d is applicable here.32 That \nis, the will to represent multiple and often contradictory social \nrealities is enmeshed with the need to respond to already existing, \nreceived, and often pejorative ideas. Nevertheless, the assimila-\ntion of films into preconceived aesthetic or ideological categories \nat the point of reception can occlude the variety and development \nof national cinemas; as such, continued work on diverse represen-\ntations of Iranian (post)modernity is obviously desirable.\nIt is worth adding that the work of any director tends to \ndevelop technically and thematically. Kiarostami\u2019s extraordinarily \nminimalist Ten (France\/Iran\/US, 2002) uses confined space and \ngendered thematics to comment more overtly on social issues than \ndo his previous films. Shot from the dashboard of a car and cut-\nting between one camera pointed at the female lead and another \nat the passenger seat, Ten presents a divorcing woman at the center \nof a nexus of interrelationships, ranging from familial to random \nand transient associations. Sexist social attitudes are evident in \nher son\u2019s belligerence and parroting of her estranged husband\u2019s \nabuse. This is interrupted by dialogue between the woman and \nher sister, friends, and diverse other women, including a prosti-\ntute, a young woman who shaves her head, and an elderly woman \non her way to the mosque. Both literally (through her seemingly \nrandom driving) and structurally (through the presentation of \nthe film in ten chapters), the female protagonist is shown negoti-\nating a contradictory urban modernity. The viewer\u2019s inconsistent \naccess to her face, as she alternately wears and takes off sunglasses \nand rearranges or lets slip her headscarf, indicates what Naghibi \ndescribes as a common practice of actively \u201cplaying with the cat-\negories of self-effacement and performance, modesty and van-\nity.\u201d The bad-hejabi disturbs the reductive veiled\/unveiled binary \nof oppression and resistance still assumed in non-Muslim over-\nfreighted conceptions of \u201cthe veil.\u201d33 As such, material and supple-\nmentary veils in Ten point beyond the sartorial self-representation \n14 \u2022 Camera Obscura\nWomen in a Widening Frame \u2022 15\nof one woman to signify catachrestically, in Gayatri Chakravorty \nSpivak\u2019s terms, as \u201cconcept metaphor without an adequate refer-\nent\u201d in the cross-cultural encounter.34\nWhile it is problematic to generalize a \u201cnative informant\u201d \nposition, Iranian women do engage dynamically with their com-\nplex environment and assert the need to localize the politics of \nfeminism. In contemporary Iran, conceptions of gender are con-\nstantly changing as a result of internal debate among different \nfactions of the clergy, women\u2019s groups, associations and journals, \nand work produced by Iranian emigrants.35 Cinema has proved \na powerful means of displacing official discourses through the \nmetonymical use of \u201cwoman\u201d to signify broader social issues and \nto transgress the limits of censorship regulations. This may lead, \nhowever, to the displacement and deferral of the experiences, \nlimitations, and demands of women\u2019s lives; as Farahmand sug-\ngests, the repeated visualization of \u201cwomen\u2019s plight\u201d can lead to \none-dimensional characters and repetitive thematics.36 Moreover, \nwhile productive theoretical debates have taken place recently \non the subject of relatively valorized forms of women\u2019s agency in \ndiverse cultural contexts,37 I suggest that a certain fascination \nremains with images of \u201cother\u201d women as cultural victims. In \norder to demonstrate this phenomenon, I turn to Samira Makh-\nmalbaf\u2019s The Apple.\nMakhmalbaf\u2019s precocious talents, her family\u2019s film credentials, \nand the unusual subject matter and presentation of her first \nfull-length film captured the imagination of international audi-\nences.38 The impetus for The Apple was a television report on the \nNaderi family, who lived in a deprived district of Tehran and had \nbecome entangled with social welfare in a child-custody case. \nBecause the family had already been critically represented in the \npopular press, the premise of the project was to fill out the case \nwith nuance, sympathy, and attention to change. Makhmalbaf \ncontacted the family through a welfare center, obtained permis-\nsion from the father, and began filming ten days later as the girls \nwere about to be released.\nThe plot is simple: Concerned families in the neighbor-\nhood petition the local director of welfare about the neglect \nand virtual imprisonment of the Naderi twin girls, Zahra and \nMassoumeh, aged twelve. Welfare agents take the girls into cus-\ntody until their parents engineer their release by promising that \nthe girls will be washed, taught some skills, and allowed to leave \nthe family compound. The parents cannot keep these promises \nbecause the mother is blind and the father does not want to leave \nthe girls \u201cunprotected\u201d when he leaves to beg and buy ice and \nbread. Frustrated, Mrs. Mohamed, the social worker, eventually \nlocks him in behind the same barred, inner gate that has confined \nthe children. In the midst of the dispute, the girls are released \non the streets of Tehran, where they have a series of adventures \nand begin a tentative education in social relationships. The film \nends with Mrs. Naderi stumbling alone out of the house onto the \nstreet, where a boy in an upstairs window taunts her with an apple \ndangled on a string. She finally seizes the apple.\nAll of the family members play themselves. The writing of \nthe script followed rather than preceded each of the eleven days of \nfilming, which meant that the family actively influenced the shape \nof narrative. Makhmalbaf indicates that some events are fictional, \nsuch as the locking up of the father by the social worker. However, \nkey symbolic elements, such as the girls\u2019 fascination with apples, \nemerged from \u201cthe children\u2019s own world\u201d at the time of filming.39 \nThe girls thus contributed to the diegesis through their spontane-\nous actions and choice of props. Because Makhmalbaf entered the \ndrama as it was still unfolding, the girls\u2019 experiences are captured \nwhile they are adapting to the outside world. This sense of imme-\ndiacy is enhanced by the use of a handheld camera, which, for \nexample, follows the girls down the street on their first escape.\nIn reality, and against the expectations raised by their phys-\nical liberation at the end of the film, social workers subsequently \nplaced Zahra and Massoumeh in a new home and Mrs. Naderi \ndied.40 These are sobering reminders that the film\u2014despite its \ntemporal proximity to and eventual participation in the events, \nthe authenticating effect of the camera work, and the active con-\ntributions of the actors\u2014is ultimately conceived and realized as \na finite narrative drama. Makhmalbaf asserts rather disingenu-\n16 \u2022 Camera Obscura\nWomen in a Widening Frame \u2022 17\nously, \u201cI don\u2019t judge, I just show things as they are. Let people look \nat themselves and see what is wrong and what is right; if they want \nto change, they can.\u201d41 In fact, the use of repeated motifs\u2014plants, \nhands, apples, and mirrors, discussed below\u2014define this as a \npoetic realist fi lm, in which symbolic elements are interwoven to \nimply an extradiegetic narrative perspective.\nHowever, the presentation of Mr. Naderi reflects Makhmal-\nbaf\u2019s insistence on the emotional complexity of her characters. \nThe film juxtaposes the girls\u2019 neglect and incarceration with the \nfather\u2019s distress, articulated through invocations of God and pleas \nabout poverty and his wife\u2019s blindness. While the patriarchal pre-\ncepts on which he bases his life are presented as outmoded, they \nare given weight, albeit ironically, through his reading from popu-\nlar street texts such as \u201cAdvice to Fathers.\u201d The imaginary com-\nmunity provided by religion and tradition is figured, with pathos, \nas inadequate compensation for the family\u2019s exclusion from a rap-\nidly changing society. Nevertheless, there is an evident hypocrisy \nin the father\u2019s position; while the camera witnesses him locking \nthe girls in every day, he blames their incarceration on his wife.\nMore elliptically, the girls\u2019 social emancipation is presented \nas also fraught with ambivalence. Mrs. Mohamed and the father \ninsist that the girls need to learn social skills in order to marry, \nand the social worker gives them each a comb and a mirror. If \nthese represent the demands placed upon public female identity, \nself-presentation, and modesty, in particular, then the girls\u2019 insis-\ntence on reflecting everything in their mirrors, from the lock on \nthe gate to the neighborhood goat, is a disarming deflection of \ntheir symbolic purpose. (The young boy selling ice cream also \nbecomes absorbed in combing his hair.) The film focuses on mar-\nginalization but implies, simultaneously, that full participation \nin society may bring dubious privileges. Similarly the lures of the \noutside world\u2014apples, ice cream, and watches\u2014are rarely acces-\nsible, at least not without money.42\nThis context of urban poverty, illiteracy, and family dis-\nability works to explicate, if not justify, the parents\u2019 treatment of \nZahra and Massoumeh. The family is thrown into relief as a par-\nticular case via a backdrop of social and economic diversity in the \nneighborhood; the resourcefulness of the female social worker \nand the interventions of the women neighbors render the trope of \nfemale incarceration relative. The Apple is troubling, nevertheless, \nin its presentation of Mrs. Naderi. When asked about obtaining \nthe parents\u2019 permission to recreate the twins\u2019 experiences, Samira \nMakhmalbaf has said only that the father was the relevant source \nof authority.43 Mrs. Naderi is blind, illiterate, and verbally abusive. \nBecause she speaks a Turkish dialect, she can communicate with \nneither the neighbors nor the social workers.44 In the opening \nscenes, she forces her daughters to conceal not only their faces \nand heads but even their eyes, implying not only that girls are vul-\nnerable to the gaze of others, but that a visual relationship with \nthe world is inherently dangerous. Given the symbolic equation \nof apples with freedom (however ambivalently inscribed this is), \nthe early close-up on Mrs. Naderi\u2019s hand as it grips an arm of each \ngirl, one of which limply holds an apple, metonymically represents \nthe mother as an incarcerating rather than liberating force.\nIn the closing minutes of the film, Mrs. Mohamed leaves \nthe gate open as a lure for the mother to emerge after the depar-\nture of her husband and daughters. Mrs. Naderi deliberates anx-\niously on both the inner and outer thresholds of the house. She \nlooks at herself in the mirror, her reflection denoting the dispar-\nity between what the camera and spectator perceive and what she \nherself can see. When she stumbles into the street and calls for \nher daughters, she is teased by an apple, raised and lowered on \nthe string by the boy in the opposite window. The final, frozen \nframe, in which she finally grasps the apple, suggests an epiph-\nany of understanding facilitated by the intervention of outsid-\ners (social workers and, arguably, the film crew). Her muttered \nrefrain, \u201cCome here. Don\u2019t let go of the children. Come home. \nTake the children by the arm,\u201d has no audience within the dieg-\nesis but, I suggest, echoes beyond the final frame.\nMakhmalbaf presents both mother and daughters as physi-\ncally and verbally disabled females in a traditionalist, poor sub-\nsociety, victims of a seemingly insurmountable set of discrimina-\ntions. Mrs. Naderi\u2019s physical disempowerment through blindness \nextends to her overall silencing in the dispute that rages between \nMr. Naderi and Mrs. Mohamed; her only mode of intervention is \nto swear at both them and the girls. However, the thematic asso-\n18 \u2022 Camera Obscura\nWomen in a Widening Frame \u2022 19\nciation between vision, voice, and power is displaced to the focus \non the twins who, cut off from contact with society, cannot speak \nproperly and are impaired in their physical movement. Corre-\nsponding with Mrs. Naderi\u2019s inability to defend herself verbally \nis the fact that she cannot see what is being filmed and so can \nfunction only as filmed object. When she mumbles frequently \nthat she is scared, the film does not explore the nature and cause \nof her fear. Thus, while there is a constant sympathetic focus on \nZahra and Massoumeh, who incarnate the symbol of the stunted \nplant that opens the film, no empathy is sustained with their \nmother and, at the end of the film, Mrs. Naderi\u2019s situation has \nnot improved with that of her daughters. When Mrs. Mohamed \nencourages her to seek help, she struggles to free her hand, but \nthe motives for her resistance are not pursued. It appears that \nthe camera is experienced as another traumatic intrusion, given \nthat Mrs. Naderi remains off-screen, in the shadows of the house, \nor with her face completely covered. While the media are rep-\nresented critically via microphones thrust at the girls in welfare \nand the reductive lampooning of Mr. Naderi in the newspaper, \nThe Apple underplays the fact that it, too, consists of an encounter \nbetween filming and filmed subjects.\nThis elision becomes more troubling once the film enters \nthe cross-cultural domain. There, the film is sanctioned as an \nauthentic representation of social reality because, as Jasmin Dar-\nznik suggests, The Apple is \u201ca story that the West has been wait-\ning for Iran to tell about itself.\u201d45 Trinh exposes a stubborn incli-\nnation to identify \u201cthe fundamental referent of the social\u201d in \ncross-cultural viewing acts of any genre, a tendency that is exac-\nerbated when visual texts purport to \u201ccatch reality on the run.\u201d46 \nThis propensity has a substantial historical pedigree in which \nthe political economy of the gaze is weighted unevenly. Fatimah \nTobing Rony, mobilizing a Saidian frame of analysis and citing \nClaude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, describes how explorers, anthropologists, \nand cultural tourists have historically seen \u201cwhat they already \nknew they would find, images predigested by certain \u2018platitudes \nand commonplaces.\u2019 \u201d47 While anthropological discourses have \nundergone a self-reflexive turn, a range of commentators affirm \nthat Islamic cultures and identities are still assigned a place out-\nside the teleology of progress.48 The tendency is exacerbated in \nrelation to Muslim women, who are assumed to live at odds with \ndominant Islamic discourse, the law, the nation-state, historical \narchives, and technology. As such, female experience is construed \nmetonymically, rendering women as ethnographic objects rather \nthan historical subjects.49\nIt is within this epistemological framework that we can \ninterpret what Darznik encapsulates as the predominant reaction \nto the then seventeen-year-old Samira Makhmalbaf, whose \u201cvery \npresence [at Cannes] seemed a paradox. . . . Was Iran a country \nthat imprisoned girls in their homes or a country that set them \nfree to make films of international repute?\u201d50 Makhmalbaf\u2019s \nsubsequent work has clarified her intrinsically skeptical attitude \ntoward existing representational frameworks in Iran and beyond. \nIn At Five in the Afternoon, the discourse of the Koran is explicitly \nrevealed as alienating for the female protagonist who is strug-\ngling, like the setting of post-9\/11 Afghanistan, to come into \nindependent being. However, her futile attempts to gain access \nto the rhetoric of female politicians (such as Indira Gandhi) sug-\ngest a wider impoverishment of discursive frameworks for female \nagency. More holistically, the virtual realism of Blackboards (Takht\u00e9 \nsiah) (Iran\/Italy\/Japan, 2000), set on the amorphous borders of \nIran and focused on a black and blank canvas on which nothing is \nsuccessfully named, disables assumptions that represented objects \ncan be transmuted into useable statements about social reality.\nIn the docudrama Divorce Iranian Style, Kim Longinotto and Ziba \nMir-Hosseini self-consciously respond to the challenge of repre-\nsenting contemporary Iranian women. The idea for the film origi-\nnated with Longinotto, a British director whose work is character-\nized by collaborative filmmaking, the use of an all-woman crew, \nand the portrayal of non-Western cultures. Longinotto was inter-\nested in the lack of fit between the culture presented in Iranian \nart films and the \u201cdemonized view of Iranian people in England\u201d \nthat prevailed in the early 1990s. She was particularly motivated to \ncollaborate with Mir-Hosseini, an Iranian now resident in Britain, \nafter reading Mir-Hosseini\u2019s Marriage on Trial (1993), an anthro-\npological study on women and sharia law.51\n20 \u2022 Camera Obscura\nWomen in a Widening Frame \u2022 21\nDivorce is set predominantly in one family court in central \nTehran. It was filmed over a period of four weeks for Britain\u2019s \nChannel 4 and consists of a series of legal cases in which women \nfile for divorce, alimony, and child care. The film was imbricated \nfrom its inception in a cross-cultural politics of representation: \nthe BBC refused the project, arguing that British audiences are \nresistant to subtitled documentaries and that the veiled protago-\nnists of the drama were too \u201canonymous\u201d and not \u201csexy\u201d enough \n(25). Furthermore the Iranian government, uneasy about much-\npublicized divorce rates and deteriorating family values in the \nWest, first rejected the film proposal. Commissioning editor Peter \nMoore commented wryly that, from its inception, the project felt \n\u201clike a forced marriage.\u201d52 Mir-Hosseini recalls that most people \n\u201cwanted us to change our theme, to film a \u2018politically correct\u2019 \nissue which reflected a \u2018positive image\u2019 of Iran, such as marriage \nceremonies, female members of parliament, or mothers of mar-\ntyrs\u201d; the directors responded that a foregrounding of the subject \nof martyrdom would only contribute to sensationalist expecta-\ntions about Iran (181, 173).\nThis prefilmic negotiation helped the directors to clarify \ntheir presentation of the project and the representational poli-\ntics that it entailed. They decided to focus on personal and social \ncomplexity\u2014what they hoped were universal, albeit culturally \ninflected, concerns. By producing \u201cpowerful yet non-judgmental \nnarratives,\u201d they wanted to foreground individual experiences of \nspecific sociolegal realities and thus to complicate assumptions \nabout Iran as a special or extreme context of gendered politics. \nDivorce presents the cases of six women, four of which\u2014those of \nMassy, Ziba, Jamileh, and Maryam\u2014are developed in detail. Mir-\nHosseini explains the editing principle:\nWe tried to focus on commonalities rather than on the exotic and the \ndifferent, to remind the viewer that marriage is a difficult institution . . . \nthat societies and individuals deal with this in different ways. . . . We also \nwanted . . . to give glimpses into the lives of ordinary people. Above all, \nwe wanted to let the women speak, to show them as individuals going \nthrough a difficult phase in their lives and to communicate the pain\u2014\nand the humour\u2014involved. (191)\nStandards of privacy were enforced throughout; none of the liti-\ngants (including husbands) are shown without prior consent. The \nfocus on a single court enables the directors to \u201cfocus on charac-\nters and develop storylines\u201d or \u201cself-contained\u201d narratives.53\nAs the courthouse is defined as masculine space, the all-\nfemale crew (all of whom observed hijab) are assumed by the \nfemale litigants to be \u201con the right side\u201d; as such, they often smile, \nwink at, and appeal directly to the film crew as witnesses.54 Mir-\nHosseini indicates that the two directors present themselves as two \nfacets of the same person, with herself as culturally, linguistically, \nand legally fluent mediator and confidante, and Longinotto in a \nmore detached, discrete role. Mir-Hosseini consistently held her \nface at the same level as Longinotto\u2019s camera, and the two women \nnever spoke to each other in court except where remarks explic-\nitly addressed to Longinotto required translation. The directors \ndo not, however, attempt to erase their presence from the film, in \nwhich their voices remain audible on the soundtrack as well as in \nthe framing voice-overs.55\nFor Mir-Hosseini, Divorce is loaded with both personal and \nprofessional freight. In Islam and Gender, she explains,\nI found myself in an uncannily familiar situation of shifting perspectives \nand self-redefinition: as well as refocusing my views on the complex \npolitics involved in the representation of women, I once more had to \nconfront, articulate, and honor my own multiple identities. During my \ndebates with clerics in Qom [for research toward Islam and Gender], \nI had to justify my feminism; now I wanted to articulate the Muslim \nand Iranian aspects of my identity [to British television executives and \nIranian officials].56\nMir-Hosseini has gained a heightened awareness of the performa-\ntive nature of identity. When she met women outside the court dur-\ning her own divorce proceedings, she remembers, \u201cI often started \nby relating how my own marriage broke down and how I obtained \nmy divorce . . . I soon noticed that every time I told my story it \nsounded different: I emphasized parts of my experience that \nrelated to those of the women I was talking to. I became increas-\ningly sensitive to situations; to how different contexts produce \n22 \u2022 Camera Obscura\nWomen in a Widening Frame \u2022 23\ndifferent narratives, how one can control this production, how \nmuch depends on one\u2019s perspective\u201d (xiv). Divorce was presented \nin Channel 4\u2019s True Stories series and is offered to Western audi-\nences as a previously undiscovered \u201cangle of vision\u201d on Iran. How-\never, Mir-Hosseini\u2019s third-eye perspective implicates herself as not \nonly a mediating subject.57 Her discourse interacts with those of \nwomen experiencing social and legal conflicts similar to her own; \nas indicated above, the project encourages other women to articu-\nlate aspects of her Muslim and Iranian identity in her place. This \nreverses the authoritative balance implicit in a project that pur-\nports to \u201clet women speak.\u201d Further, both directors commit them-\nselves as actors in the drama. After a dramatic off-camera scene in \nwhich Maryam rips up a court order to hand over maintenance of \nher child, the directors refuse to testify against her.58 This incident \nsignals a rejection of an objective position and aligns the directors \nin subversive solidarity with Maryam against the law.\nThe film makes a vital ideological intervention in its pre-\nsentation of official discourses as permeable. By persistently and \neven aggressively engaging with the law, women across the social \nspectrum are shown actively to participate in contemporary \ndebates on gendered rights in Islamic Iran. As in Panahi\u2019s Circle, \nwomen battle a frustrating and contradictory system, but here the \nprotagonists mobilize a range of creative strategies. Massy pub-\nlicly exposes her husband\u2019s sexual shortcomings and beguiles the \ncourt officials in order to reclaim her \u201clost\u201d legal papers. Sixteen-\nyear-old Ziba asserts her legal right to continue studying while \nmarried and openly manipulates her husband by threatening \nto file for abuse. Jamileh uses the court session merely to \u201cteach \n[her husband] a lesson,\u201d as she has no intention of divorcing \nhim. Women are not revealed as hopelessly oppressed but as an \narticulate force. The final voice-over, superimposed on the face of \neach of the main characters in slow motion, indicates that all have \nachieved some degree of success in their dealings with the court.\nAs Tobing Rony suggests, by foregrounding the resis-\ntant and collaborative practices of filmed subjects, ethnography \nbecomes exponentially more enabling. As she states, the \u201cthird \neye turns on a recognition: the Other perceives the veil, the pro-\ncess of being visualized as an object, but returns the glance. The \ngesture of being frozen into a picturesque is deflected.\u201d59 Never-\ntheless, while the makers of Divorce claim \u201cthe subject position of \nthe listener\u201d instead of \u201cthe dominant position of the gazer\/criti-\ncizer,\u201d60 the two modes of cultural encounter are never entirely \nseparated. A subjective bias is implicit in the dominant thematic \nand camera focus on women, and, in one instance, Mir-Hosseini \ncriticizes Ziba\u2019s husband for marrying a young girl. The crew\u2019s par-\ntiality constitutes an insertion of values\u2014albeit occasional and pro-\nvoked by events such as Maryam\u2019s torn paper\u2014into the cultural \nspace of the diegesis.61 Despite the useful undermining of the \nauthoritative distance of the filmic apparatus, it may be construed \nthat the film team is instrumental to the outcome of cases that \nare ordered into narrative closure. Thus, as in The Apple, editing \nand structuring practices are complicit in the processes of repre-\nsentation. Further, Longinotto\u2019s camera does not altogether resist \nvoyeurism. In a case not extensively covered, one woman shields \nherself from the camera with her face veil, which does not prevent \nthe camera from focusing on her hidden profile and the hand that \nholds her veil in place. The informing discourse of the film is fur-\nther revealed through the juxtaposition of court scenes with those \nin the mosque at prayer time and with shots outside, in which the \nlate Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s portrait looms large on a billboard, thus \nlinking religion, politics, the law, and patriarchal dominance. How-\never, a nuanced scene is included in which female officials outside \nthe courts monitor the attire of the women who enter judicial pro-\nceedings. Although the court women strictly monitor the hair and \nmakeup of the claimants, their friendly tone and joking suggest \nsome degree of ironic capitulation to the rules. When one woman \nremoves her makeup, an official says jokingly, \u201cNow you look like a \nreal lady!\u201d The court secretary, Mrs. Mohar, is an essential element \nin the presentation of a diverse range of female attitudes toward \nthe law. Far from displaying solidarity with the women in court, \nshe often disputes with, reprimands, and ignores them. Her young \ndaughter Paniz functions in parodic contrast and is firmly biased \nin her perception of female innocence and respectability and \u201crub-\nbish men\u201d who \u201cdon\u2019t know how to live properly and correctly.\u201d\nAs Trinh observes, a common assumption in cross-cultural \n24 \u2022 Camera Obscura\nWomen in a Widening Frame \u2022 25\nfeminist documentary is that \u201cthose who are\/need to be given an \nopportunity to speak up never had a voice before.\u201d62 While Divorce \nforegrounds women\u2019s tenacity, the impact of the film rests, to \nsome extent, on the surprise value that the women\u2019s creative tac-\ntics hold for non-Iranian viewers. The quality and sheer quantity \nof cultural difference that inheres in the court and familial pro-\ncedures mean that assumptions about the \u201cIslamic oppression of \nwomen\u201d were inevitably confirmed for some viewers. John Ander-\nson, for example, claims that \u201cDivorce Iranian Style is easy to digest, \nonce you grasp its most fundamental concept: Women under the \nkind of Islamic law practiced in Iran have no rights. After that, \neverything makes perfect sense.\u201d The same journalist employs ori-\nentalist terms to describe the \u201cclaustrophobic Islamic courtroom,\u201d \n\u201cthe barbaric legal legacy of the Khomeini era,\u201d and a \u201crigged\u201d \nand inherently opaque legal system. In opposition, the women are \ncast as revolutionaries, coached and abetted by their British coun-\nterparts, in what he describes as \u201cguerrilla-advocacy cinema.\u201d In \nsum, Iranian women \u201chave to be so tenacious and resolute about \neven daring to bring their cases up within a system so oblivious to \nthe concept of westernized justice that they assume heroic stature \njust by being there.\u201d63 Anderson\u2019s comments, although extreme, \nsuggest that the ethnographic object continues to be assimilated \nas \u201cthe real thing\u201d despite efforts to complicate the association \nbetween the two terms.\nIranians at home and abroad may respond with a height-\nened sensibility to representations of Iranian culture. In 1999, \nDivorce was rejected by the prestigious Fajr Film Festival in Tehran \non the grounds that permission had not been sought from all the \nmain actors (in fact, all of the women had provided written con-\nsent before filming began). While some women\u2019s-rights activists \nsupported the film, there was little consensus otherwise among \nviewers either in or outside the country. Critics suggested that the \nfilm was \u201cstaged\u201d and the actors handpicked to produce a highly \ncritical perspective on the status of women, thus exposing the \nIslamic Republic to Western critique. Others saw it as an indict-\nment of sexist Islamic law or even as Iranian propaganda. Mir-\nHosseini concludes that negative reactions were differently moti-\nvated, but \u201crooted in a fear of being judged and misunderstood \nby the \u2018other\u2019\u2014the West,\u201d as well as symptomatic of a profound \nIranian uncertainty about the current Islamic regime.64\nCross-cultural spectators do not merely consume but also contrib-\nute to the production of meaning in films. Laura Marks suggests \nthat \u201cas well as bearing meanings to the audience, [films] receive \nimpressions from the people who have seen them. Intercultural \ncinema builds up these impressions like a palimpsest and passes \nthem on to other audiences. The very circulation of a film among \ndifferent viewers is like a series of skin contacts that leave mutual \ntraces.\u201d65 This transfer of meaning is not just emotive, tactile, or \naesthetic, however. As Trinh points out, documentary film posits a \n\u201creal\u201d which must be legitimized as such by the spectator.66 Trinh\u2019s \ncomment reminds us that the nonnative spectator always already \nhas expectations, so that, as Poonam Arora comments, simplistic \nand stereotypical representations are the kind most easily read by \nmainstream Western audiences.67 In light of these observations, \nMarks\u2019s model of a \u201cmutual\u201d cinematic contact conceals the trace \nof epistemological violence that so often inheres.\nThat said, it is difficult for a Western viewer to disavow \none\u2019s own limitations in interpretting Iranian cinema. Contempo-\nrary Iranian art cinema preempts and resists imposed meanings \nby actively engaging with ideas of perception and representation. \nIt consistently grounds its thematics in the local and makes few \nallowances in terms of cultural explication; there is a tendency to \nrefuse conventional narrative closure and to manipulate spectator \nresponse. It should, as a result, be difficult for Western viewers to \nmaintain the fiction that they are \u201cthe privileged decoders and \nultimate interpreters of meaning.\u201d68\nI suggest that contemporary Iranian cinema should be \nengaged with full attention to the \u201ctranslation effects,\u201d which shift \nand resettle as the films are disseminated across national bor-\nders. Rather than confining our conception of translation to the \nliteral activity (for example, the use of subtitles to frame Iranian \nfilms for European and US audiences), it is helpful to think of \nfilms as Sherry Simon does: as \u201cdocuments which exist materially \nand move about, add to our store of knowledge, and contribute \n26 \u2022 Camera Obscura\nWomen in a Widening Frame \u2022 27\nto ongoing changes in esthetics.\u201d As texts, films are also \u201cwriting \npractices fully informed by the tensions that traverse all cultural \nrepresentation.\u201d69 Translated across national and cultural bound-\naries, these films inevitably participate in a process of representa-\ntion that may reinforce but ideally will mediate these tensions in \nthe international domain.\nNotes\n1.  While Iran has never been colonized, structural similarities \nto a colonial situation in its twentieth-century history enable a \npostcolonial frame of analysis. The ideological positioning of the \nstate since 1979 has been dialectically defined by the economic \nexploitation of the country by Europe and the US and their \nperceived cultural hegemony prior to the overthrow of the Shah.\n2.

While the director is a fictional character, one can speculate \nthat he \u201cstands in\u201d for Kiarostami (see page 9).
