INTRODUCTION\nClean fuel research, including into improvement of the processes of desulfurization and\ndearomatization, has become an important focus of environmental catalysis studies worldwide.\nSulfur contained in diesel fuel is an environmental concern because the sulfur is converted to\nSOx during combustion, which not only contributes to acid rain, but also poisons the catalytic\nconverters now widely installed for exhaust emission treatment. The problem of sulfur removal\nhas become more apparent due to the high sulfur contents in crude oils and the low limit of sulfur\ncontent in finished fuel products specified by regulatory authorities. The Environmental\nProtection Agency of the United States (EPA) had set a target to reduce the sulfur content of\ndiesel fuel from 500 ppm to 15 ppm for the year 2006 and 10 ppm will become the maximum\ncontent for sulfur by 2008 (Yang et al., 2005). Thiols, sulphides and thiophenes are readily\nremoved by hydrodesulfurization (HDS), but up to 70% of the sulfur in petroleum is found as\nDBT and substituted (methylated) DBTs, which are particularly recalcitrant to HDS treatment\ncompared with mercaptans and sulfides (Yang et al., 2005; Le Borgne et al., 2003).\nMicrobiological methods to desulfurize hydrocarbon streams offer a potentially attractive\nalternative to traditional chemical engineering methods. Biological processes require relatively\nmild conditions (low pressures and low temperatures), which could be a major advantage of\nbiodesulfurization. Therefore most studies on biodesulfurization (BDS) have focused on the\nremoval of thiophenic sulfur compounds, of which DBT is widely accepted to be representative.\nDBT is indeed considered to be particularly relevant as a model compound for the forms of\nthiophenic sulfur found in fossil fuels, such as crude oils, coals or bitumen of particular\ngeographic origins, and the various refining intermediates and fuel products manufactured\ntherefrom (Olson, 1998). Various bacteria are able to metabolize DBT. In the 1970s, Kodama\n3showed that micro\u00f6rganisms could attack DBT without removing sulfur (Scheme 1). This\nmicrobial transformation of DBT by the Kodama pathway involves cleavage of one of DBT\u2019s\naromatic rings so it has not been commercially developed because it did not remove the sulfur\natom from the heterocyclic compound, and moreover led to a decrease in the fuel\u2019s calorific\nvalue through the oxidation of benzene ring.\nScheme 1. Kodama pathway for the degradation of DBT. The product, hydroxyl formyl\nbenzothiophene, retains the sulfur moiety (Kodama et al., 1973).\nAnother biological pathway that is of interest to researchers involves four enzymatic steps and is\ntherefore called the 4S pathway (Kilbane 1989). This pathway (Scheme 2) is more interesting for\npractical applications, since sulfur removal takes place without destruction of the aromatic rings.\n4Scheme 2. 4S pathway for DBT desulfurization by R. erythropolis IGTS8. The DBT\ndesulfurization pathway results in the formation of 2-hydroxybiphenyl (HBP) and sulfate.\nIn a previous investigation, it has been found thatusing the bacterium S. putrefaciens strain\nNCIMB 8768 in clay desulfurization, sulfur odour was reduced, and the use of this bacterium for\ncoal desulfurization has been examined (Prayuenyong, 2001). The present study builds on that\nprevious work to study in more detail the desulfurization ability of the bacterium S. putrefaciens,\nand to compare its biodesulfurization activity profile with that of the widely studied\nRhodococcus erythropolis strain IGTS8.\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Chemicals\nNutrient agar and broth were from Oxoid (UK), dibenzothiophene (DBT) (99%),dimethyl\nsulfoxide, 2-hydroxybiphenyl (HBP), Gibbs reagent and all other chemicals were from Fisher\nScientific (UK). Water was highly purified by ion exchange and reverse osmosis in an Elga\ninstallation.\n52.2 Bacterial strains\nShewanella putrefaciens (NCIMB 8768) was purchased from National Collections of Industrial\nand Marine Bacteria Ltd (Aberdeen, UK). Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8 (ATCC 53968)\nfrom American Type Culture Collections (Virginia, USA) was used for comparison.\n2.3 Medium and growth conditions\nBasic salt medium (BSM), a sulfur-free medium containing 2.44 g KH2PO4, 5.47 g Na2HPO4,\n2.00 g NH4Cl, 0.2 g MgCl2.6H2O, 0.001 g CaCl2.2H2O, 0.001 g FeCl3.6H2O, 0.004 g\nMnCl2.4H2O and 1.84 g glycerol per litre of deionized water, was used. DBT dissolved in\nethanol was added as the sole sulfur source to give final concentrations of 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 mM.\nCells were cultivated in 250 mL flasks containing 100 mL of medium on a rotary shaker\noperated at 100 rpm for one week at 30 \u00b0C.\n2.4 Resting cell reaction\nCells were grown until the mid-exponential growth phase and harvested by centrifugation\n(Hettick-EBA 20- Germany) at 6000 rpm for 15 min. The cell pellets were washed twice with\nRinger\u2019s solution. The cells were then resuspended in the same solution, giving A600 = 1.0, and\nused on the day of harvesting. One mL of inoculum was added to 250 mL flasks containing 100\nmL of BSM with 0.3 mM of DBT-ethanol solution and incubated at 30 \u00b0C (shaking at 100 rpm).\n2.5 Detection methods\nGrowth was monitored via optical density at 600 nm; the concentration of cells was determined\nfrom the linear relationship between OD600 and cell concentration (Stanier, 1976) while dry\n6weights were determined after washing cultures three times with Ringer\u2019s solution and drying in\na 100 \u00b0C oven until a constant weight was obtained. Determination of HBP and DBT was carried\nout by Gibb\u2019s assay and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). All experiments were\ndone in triplicate.\n2.5.1 Gibb\u2019s assay\nDesulfurization activity was monitored using the Gibb\u2019s reagent (2,6-dichloroquinone-4-\nchloroimide) to detect the 2-hydroxybiphenyl (HBP) produced from DBT. Gibb\u2019s reagent reacts\nwith the aromatic hydroxyl groups at pH 8 to form a blue complex that can be monitored\nspectrophotometrically at 610 nm after 30 min incubation at room temperature (Kayser et al.,\n1993). Briefly the assay consists of the following steps: aliquots (5 mL) of culture broth are\ncentrifuged (1200 rpm, 10 min) to remove cells. The supernatant (2 mL) was then transferred to\nan Eppendorf tube. 0.1 g Gibb\u2019s reagent was dissolved in 10 mL absolute ethanol in a test tube,\nand 20 \u03bcL were added to each Eppendorf tube containing 2.0 mL supernatant adjusted to pH 8.\nThe assays were incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 30 minutes to complete the colour development. The\nabsorbance of the supernatant was determined at 610 nm and converted to HBP concentration\nbased on a standard curve (Monticello, 1993).\n2.5.2 HPLC\nThe concentration of DBT and HBP were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography\nusing a Shimadzu HPLC Model LC-10AD VP equipped with a Nova Pak phenyl column (3.9 \u00d7\n150 mm) together with a guard column. Elution was isocratic with 60% acetonitrile and 40%\nwater at 1.5 mL min\u20131, and detection used a 117 UV detector fixed at wavelength = 233 nm. The\n7mobile phase, a mixture of HPLC grade water and acetonitrile, was sonicated for 10 minutes and\nfurther degassed with helium before use.\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nBiodesulfurization activity comparison: both strains grew in BSM+DBT and produced HBP\nDBT degradation (Figure 1). The DBT concentration was halved after 3 days incubation. HBP\nanalysis confirmed that similarly to R. erythropolis, S. putrefaciens desulfurized DBT through\nthe selective cleavage of the C-S bonds, resulting in the accumulation of HBP. The detection of\nHBP when Shewanella utilized DBT as the sole sulfur source suggests that the DBT-\ndesulfurizing pathway is the so-called 4S pathway as proposed by Kilbane et al. (1992) for\ndegradation using Rhodococcus.\nThis type of reaction is desirable for practical desulfurization since the sulfur atom is removed\nwithout C-C bond cleavage, that is, without loss of calorific energy. The amounts of HBP\nproduced and DBT degraded of R. erythropolis were not quite equivalent however (Figure 1)\n(Kayser et al., 1993).\nIt has been reported that HBP is toxic to bacterial cells; hence biodesulfurization will be\ninhibited by accumulation of HBP (Zhang et al., 2005). This is a complicating factor in our batch\nexperiments, i.e. that the end product HBP is somewhat inhibitory to cell growth and possibly\ntherefore to desulfurization activity.\n80.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n0 24 48 72 96 120\nIncubation time \/h\nB\nac\nte\nria\nlG\nro\nw\nth\n\/A\n60\n0\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n[D\nB\nT\n]&\n[H\nB\nP\n]\/\nm\nM\n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n0 24 48 72 96 120\nIncubation time \/ h\nB\nac\nte\nria\nlG\nro\nw\nth\n\/A\n60\n0\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n[D\nB\nT\n]&\n[H\nB\nP\n]\/\nm\nM\nFigure 1.

At higher concentrations,\nbacterial growth was inhibited, presumably because the bacteria could not tolerate the high\nconcentration of what is actually a bacteriotoxin.\n90.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n0 24 48 72 96 120\nIncubation time \/ h\n[H\nB\nP\n]\/\nm\nM\n0.000\n0.500\n1.000\n1.500\n2.000\n2.500\n0 24 48 72 96 120\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0 24 48 72 96 120\nIncubation time \/ h\n[H\nB\nP\n]\/\nm\nM\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0 24 48 72 96 120\nFigure 2.

CONCLUSION\nShewanella putrefaciens showed desulfurization activity and detection of HBP in the culture\nmedium is evidence that this strain desulfurized DBT via the 4S pathway. Therefore, S.\nputrefaciens is a potentially useful desulfurizing bacterium. However, regarding its effectiveness\nwe consider it necessary to confirm what is the rate-limiting step in DBT desulfurization by S.\nputrefaciens, as a first step towards determining whether the genes encoding the DBT\ndesulfurizing enzymes of Shewanella are different from those of other desulfurizating bacteria\nsuch as R. erythropolis IGTS8.\n10\nMoreover, more experiments need to be carried out to investigate parameters like pH and carbon\nsource and enriched media on the growth of the bacteria and their desulfurization activity.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nF.A. would like to thank Jeremy Ramsden for his help and guidance in the writing of this paper.\nREFERENCES\nDenome, S.A., Oldfield, C., Nash, L.J., and Young, K.D.
