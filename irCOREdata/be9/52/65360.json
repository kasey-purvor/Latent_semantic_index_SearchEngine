Difficulties in perceiving \ncoherent motion are also common in ASD. Yet it is unknown whether these two impairments \nare related. Thirteen adults with ASD and 16 age- and IQ-matched typically developing \n(TD) adults classified basic emotions from point-light and full-light displays of body \nmovements and discriminated the direction of coherent motion in random-dot \nkinematograms. The ASD group was reliably less accurate in classifying emotions regardless\nof stimulus display type, and in perceiving coherent motion. As predicted, ASD individuals \nwith higher motion coherence thresholds were less accurate in classifying emotions from \nbody movements, especially in the point-light displays; this relationship was not evident for \nthe TD group. The results are discussed in relation to recent models of biological motion \nprocessing and known abnormalities in the neural substrates of motion and social perception \nin ASD.\nKeywords: autism; biological motion; body movement; emotion; motion coherence\nPage 3 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nBodily emotion recognition and motion coherence in ASD 3\nImpaired recognition of emotions from body movements is \nassociated with elevated motion coherence thresholds in autism \nspectrum disorders\nThere are numerous reports of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) \nbeing impaired in recognizing emotions from static faces (e.g., Ashwin et al., 2006; Hobson \net al., 1988; reviewed by Pelphrey et al., 2002). Three studies have shown that individuals \nwith ASD are also impaired, relative to comparison individuals without autism, in \nrecognizing emotions from body movements, whether they are asked to describe or name \nintended expressions from point-light displays1 (Hubert et al., 2007; Moore et al., 1997) or to \nlabel, in a forced-choice task, the intended emotion represented in full-light displays1 (Philip \net al., submitted). The latter study found that the same ASD group was also impaired in \nidentifying facial and vocal expressions of basic emotions.\nOne reason why individuals with ASD might have difficulties in recognizing \nemotions in others is as a consequence of deficits in \u2018theory of mind\u2019, which are characteristic \nof ASD (e.g., Baron-Cohen, 1995; Perner et al., 1989). A theory of mind deficit is consistent \nwith the cross-modal emotion recognition deficit reported by Philip et al. (submitted). Yet \nASD has also been associated with atypical motion perception (for reviews, see Dakin & \nFrith, 2005; Milne et al., 2005), especially impairments on tasks that rely on relatively global \nor complex motion signals, such as detecting rigid, translational coherent motion in random-\ndot kinematograms (Milne et al., 2002; Milne et al., 2006; Pellicano et al., 2005; Spencer et \nal., 2000), albeit with some exceptions (Del Viva et al., 2006; Milne et al., 2006; \nTsermentseli et al., 2008). Point-light human body motion is another case of relatively global, \ncomplex motion, yet evidence for impaired detection of such motion is less clear, with one \nstudy showing impaired detection accuracy (Blake et al., 2003) but two studies showing no \neffect on accuracy (Freitag et al., 2008; Herrington et al., 2007), one of which nevertheless \nPage 4 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nBodily emotion recognition and motion coherence in ASD 4\nshowed longer detection reaction times in ASD individuals (Freitag et al., 2008). Moreover, \nevidence to date suggests that accuracy in identifying everyday, non-emotional actions from \npoint-light displays is not compromised in ASD (Hubert et al., 2007; Moore et al., 1997), \nalthough this has not yet been tested in a forced-choice paradigm.\nMight impaired recognition of emotions from body movements be attributable at least \nin part to atypical visual motion processing, as opposed to being an entirely higher-level \ndeficit in attributing emotions or mental states more generally? In order to address this \nquestion, the present study assessed the abilities of ASD and typically developing individuals \nto classify emotional expressions from body movements and to discriminate translational \ncoherent motion in random-dot kinematograms. The logic was as follows. Successful \ndiscrimination of the direction of the coherently moving dots cannot be achieved on the basis \nof the motion of one or a small number of adjacent dots, but rather, requires integration of \nmotion signals across a larger area. Motion coherence deficits \u2013 specifically, higher motion \ncoherence thresholds \u2013 are prevalent (if not universal) in ASD. Successful recognition of \nbodily expressed emotions depends on the kinematics of body or body-part movement \n(Pollick et al., 2001; Roether et al., 2008) as well as on changes in body form over time \n(Atkinson et al., 2007b). The perception of bodily kinematics and of changes in body \nform over time cannot be achieved on the basis of local image motion and, especially in \npoint-light displays, relies on the ability to perceive coherent motion. It was therefore \npredicted that, to the extent that ASD individuals would be impaired in their ability to \ndiscriminate simple coherent motion, they would also be impaired in their ability to recognize \nemotions from body movements.\nWhile bodily kinematics also provide important cues for the perception of \nbiological motion per se, especially gait, and for judging certain person characteristics \nsuch as sex and identity from gait (reviewed by Blake & Shiffrar, 2007), evidence from a \nPage 5 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nBodily emotion recognition and motion coherence in ASD 5\nstudy using point-light displays suggests that normal observers rely less on kinematic \nand form-from-motion cues to identify instrumental (goal-directed) and social actions \nthan they do to identify non-instrumental (locomotory) actions (Dittrich, 1993). A \nsecondary prediction of this study was therefore that, if individuals with ASD have \ndifficulties perceiving coherent motion and thus bodily kinematics and changes in body \nform over time, then they would be more likely to show impaired identification of non-\ninstrumental than instrumental actions. \nMethod\nParticipants\nThe ASD group comprised 13 adults (12 male) aged 18-58 years. Nine \nparticipants in the ASD group were recruited from the Psychology and Challenging Needs \nService, Roselands Clinic, Surrey (UK); the remaining 4 attended a specialist college run by \nthe European Society for People with Autism, in Newcastle-upon-Tyne (UK). All ASD \nparticipants had been diagnosed by experienced clinicians (a psychiatrist or clinical \npsychologist employed by the National Health Service) as meeting DSM-IV criteria for either \nAsperger\u2019s Syndrome (n=12) or high-functioning autism (n = 1) (American Psychiatric \nAssociation, 1994). The typically developing (TD) group comprised 16 adults (14 male) aged \n17-54 years, recruited from Durham University and a further education college in the Durham \narea.\nThe groups were group-wise matched on age, full-scale IQ, verbal IQ and \nperformance IQ, as shown in Table 1. The ASD individuals\u2019 IQ was assessed using the \nWechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence (WASI: Wechsler, 1999) or the Wechsler Adult \nIntelligence Scale \u2013 Third Edition (WISC-III, Wechsler, 1997). Estimates of IQ for the TD \nindividuals were derived using the revised version of the National Adult Reading Test (Blair \n& Spreen, 1989), which has good convergent validity with WAIS IQ scores (Crawford et al., \nPage 6 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nBodily emotion recognition and motion coherence in ASD 6\n1989), and has been used for IQ-matching purposes in previous studies with ASD individuals \n(e.g., Beaumont & Newcombe, 2006; Lawson et al., 2004).\n---------- Insert Table 1 about here. ----------\nAll participants gave signed, informed consent. Ethical approval was obtained from \nthe National Health Service South London Research Ethics Committee and the Durham \nUniversity Department of Psychology Ethics Advisory Committee.\nProcedure, tasks and stimuli\nAll participants were tested individually, in a quiet room, completing 3 experimental \ntasks in the same fixed order within a single testing session. All 3 tasks were presented on the \nsame computer monitor for all participants at a viewing distance of approximately 50cm. \nStandard instructions were provided verbally and on the monitor at the start of each task.\nForced-choice labelling of basic emotions. The stimuli were grey-scale digital movie \nclips depicting people expressing emotions with whole-body movement, as detailed in \nAtkinson, Tunstall and Dittrich (2007b) and Atkinson, Heberlein and Adolphs (2007a). (For \nexample movies, see http:\/\/www.dur.ac.uk\/a.p.atkinson\/.) Participants viewed 10 intended \nportrayals of each of anger, disgust, fear, happiness and sadness in point-light displays, and \n50 identical movement sequences in full-light displays. The full-light displays were drawn \nfrom the same set as that from which the stimuli used by Philip et al. (submitted) were drawn. \nWhile there was some overlap between the selected full-light sets for the two studies, they did \nnot contain identical exemplars of each emotion; moreover, all stimuli in the present study \nhad durations of 3 seconds, with the movements ending around the apex of the expression, \nwhereas those used by Philip et al. varied in duration and showed the actor returning to a \nneutral stance.\nThe participants viewed all 50 point-light displays sequentially in a single block, \nfollowed by the 50 corresponding full-light displays. The stimuli were presented in a different \nPage 7 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nBodily emotion recognition and motion coherence in ASD 7\nrandom order for each block and for each participant. Each movie clip disappeared from the \nscreen once it had run its length, upon which the participants were asked to press one of 5 \nkeys to indicate which emotion label \u2013 angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, or sad \u2013 best \ndescribed how the person in that movie clip was feeling. These response options appeared on \nthe screen immediately upon termination of each movie clip, remaining until a response was \nmade, after which the next clip appeared.\nForced-choice labelling of actions. The stimuli consisted in 3-second movie clips \ndepicting actors portraying one of 8 different actions with whole-body movements: 4 \ninstrumental actions (digging, kicking, knocking, pushing) and 4 non-instrumental \nactions (bending to touch toes, hopping, walking on the spot, and star-jumping or \njumping jacks). Participants viewed 4 different versions of each action in point-light \ndisplays followed by 32 identical movement sequences presented as full-light displays. (The \ninstrumental and non-instrumental actions were combined together into a single task \nwith eight response options in an effort to reduce task performance below ceiling. More \nexemplars of each action were not used because we had no reason to expect performance to \ndiffer between groups for any particular action.) The stimulus presentation and procedure \nwere the same as for the previous task, except that the participants were asked to select one of \n8 different action labels for each clip.\nMotion coherence. The stimulus for this task comprised a series of briefly presented \nrandom dot kinematograms in the form of arrays of small white dots moving against a \nuniform black background. Each array consisted of 750 approximately 1mm diameter dots, \npresented within a rectangular area measuring 15cm high by 6.5cm wide.

Each trial consisted in a larger white fixation dot in the centre of the \nscreen for 1,000ms, immediately followed by the small dot array for 200ms. The time \nbetween the offset of the dot array and the onset of the fixation dot for the subsequent trial \nvaried from 2600-7600ms, during which time the participant was required to make his or her \nresponse. These stimuli were presented as digital movie clips (25 frames per second). The \n156 trials were randomly assigned to 3 movie clips (i.e., 52 in each), such that, for each clip, \nparticipants viewed a fixed random order of stimuli; the order of the 3 movie clips was \ncounterbalanced across participants. A short break was allowed between each clip. The \nparticipants were told that some of the dots in each array would be moving together in one \ndirection, either to the left or to the right. The participants were asked to indicate verbally, for \neach array, whether the direction of motion was to the left or right, and that they should guess \nif unsure. The experimenter recorded each answer on paper. Prior questioning confirmed that \nall participants were able to discriminate reliably left from right. If participants did not \nrespond prior to the onset of the next stimulus the movie clip was stopped and, if necessary, \nthat particular trial was replayed.

Nonetheless, \nthere were some differences between groups in the relative frequencies of response-label use. \nPage 9 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nBodily emotion recognition and motion coherence in ASD 9\nTo account for these response frequency differences, unbiased hit rates (Wagner, 1993), \nwhich express accuracy as a proportion of both response and stimulus frequencies, were used \nas the principle measure of interest (Figure 1C-D).\n---------- Insert Figure 1 about here. ----------\nAn analysis of variance covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to test for \ndifferences in emotion classification accuracy between groups, emotions, and stimulus \ndisplay type, with participant age as a covariate. As age and FSIQ showed high \ncorrelations in both groups (ASD: r = .867, p < .001; TD: r = .752, p = .001; Spearman\u2019s \nrho), no additional adjustment for FSIQ was made to avoid colinearity. To reduce the \nimpact of deviations from a normal distribution, the unbiased hit rates were first \narcsine transformed. There was a highly significant main effect of group, F(1, 26) = \n10.26, p < .005, with a large effect size, r = 0.53, reflecting less accurate emotion \nclassification by the ASD individuals (M = 0.61, SD = 0.195) compared to the TD \nindividuals (M = 0.846, SD = 0.196). This main effect of emotion was modified by a \nmarginally significant Group X Emotion interaction, F(4, 104) = 2.4, p = .055. Simple \nmain effects analyses, with age as a covariate, confirmed that the ASD group was \nsignificantly less accurate than the TD group in classifying expressions of anger and \nhappiness (both ps < .01), but not expressions of fear or sadness (both ps > .1). Due to \nviolation of the homogeneity of slopes assumption, an ANCOVA was not performed on \naccuracy scores for expressions of disgust. While an ANOVA confirmed that the ASD \ngroup was significantly less accurate than the TD group in classifying expressions of \ndisgust, F(1, 27) = 11.03, p < .005, r = 0.54, this result should be interpreted with \ncaution, as age was significantly correlated with disgust classification accuracy in the \nASD group (r = -.584, p < .05) but not in the TD group (r = .035, p > .85). The 3-way \nANCOVA also revealed a marginally significant relationship between stimulus display \nPage 10 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nBodily emotion recognition and motion coherence in ASD 10\ntype and participant age, F(1, 26) = 3.88, p = .06, reflecting a significant negative \ncorrelation between age and emotion classification accuracy for the point-light displays \n(r = -.534, p < .005) but not for the full-light displays (r = -.295, p > .1). There were no \nother significant main effects or interactions (all ps > .08). \nMotion coherence\nFigure 1E shows the accuracy of the two groups on the motion coherence task as a \nfunction of the percentage of dots that were moving coherently to the left or right. To test for \ndifferences between groups, an ANOVA was conducted with group as the between-subjects \nvariable and coherence level as a repeated-measures variable. (Variations in age and IQ \nwere not significantly correlated with performance at any of the coherence levels, all ps \n> .05; thus it was deemed unnecessary to statistically control for these variables.) \nOverall motion coherence accuracy was significantly greater in the TD group than in \nthe ASD group, F(1, 29) = 6.33, p < .05, r = .47.

First, psychometric functions were fitted to each participant\u2019s data using the \npsignifit toolbox version 2.5.6 for Matlab (see http:\/\/bootstrap-software.org\/psignifit\/), which \nimplements the maximum-likelihood method described by Wichmann and Hill (2001). The \nGumbel function was used, with the 13 coherence levels plotted on a logarithmic scale. \nPsychometric functions could not be adequately fitted to the data of 4 participants from the \nTD group (3 of whom were at ceiling). Log-scaled motion coherence thresholds for 75% \ncorrect performance (a standard cutoff) were extrapolated from the psychometric functions \nPage 11 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nBodily emotion recognition and motion coherence in ASD 11\nfor each remaining participant.

Initial, exploratory backward stepwise regression analyses \nrevealed that the significant predictors of overall emotion classification accuracy (collapsed \nacross emotion category) for the point-light displays were group, motion coherence threshold, \nand VIQ (all ps < .05, overall R2 = .579). A forced-entry hierarchical regression analysis \nwas then conducted, excluding variables that were statistically redundant. To control \nfor the influence of VIQ, this variable was entered in a first step. Motion coherence \nthresholds and participant group were entered in the second and third steps, \nrespectively. Motion coherence thresholds significantly accounted for 31.8% of the \nvariance in emotion classification scores for the point-light displays (\uf062 = -.57, t = -3.63, p\n= .001) over and above that accounted for by VIQ, with participant group significantly \naccounting for an additional 11% of the variance (\uf062 = -.34, t = -2.35, p < .05). Motion \ncoherence thresholds did not predict overall emotion classification accuracy for the full-\nlight displays, however (p > .1); the only significant predictor was group, accounting for \n30.1% of the variance in emotion classification accuracy (\uf062 = -.55, t = -3.15, p < .01).\nMotion coherence thresholds themselves were unrelated to age or any of the IQ measures (all \nps > .5, Spearman\u2019s rho, 2-tailed).

For the ASD group, log-scaled motion coherence thresholds \nsignificantly accounted for 74% of the variance in emotion classification scores for the \npoint-light displays (\uf062 = -.87, t = -7.1, p = .001) and 55.8% of the variance for the full-\nlight displays (\uf062 = -.76, t = -3.85, p < .005), after controlling for the effects of VIQ. On its \nown, VIQ did not significantly account for variance in emotion classification scores for \neither the point-light or full-light displays (both ps> .25); nonetheless, with motion \ncoherence thresholds included in the model, VIQ did significantly account for \nremaining variance in emotion classification scores for the point-light displays, R2\nchange = .218, \uf062 = -.47, t = -3.86, p < .005, but not for the full-light displays (p > .08).

Given the large departures from \nnormality in the distributions of the action classification scores, differences between groups \nwith respect to the unbiased hit rates were assessed using one-tailed Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z\ntests. The ASD group was significantly less accurate than the TD group overall (i.e., \ncollapsed across action and stimulus display types), Z = 1.09, p < .05, r = .202. None of \nthe comparisons between groups for the 4 individual stimulus conditions depicted in \nFigure 1F survived correction for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method\n(all ps > .0125). Nonetheless, the means of the individual ASD participant z-scores for \nthe 4 stimulus conditions revealed a clear trend for greater impairment for non-\ninstrumental than instrumental actions: full-light non-instrumental (z = -2.17) > point-\nlight non-instrumental (z = -1.59) > point-light instrumental (z = -0.71) > full-light \ninstrumental (z = -0.5).\nFinally, linear regression analyses were conducted to test whether log-scaled \nmotion coherence thresholds predicted accuracy in classifying non-emotional actions by \nthe ASD group. (A similar regression analysis for the TD group was judged to be \nunwarranted, given the insufficient variation in this group\u2019s action classification scores.) \nNo significant relationships were evident, either for the instrumental or non-\ninstrumental actions in either the point-light or full-light displays (all ps > .4); PIQ, VIQ \nand age did not predict action classification accuracy either (all ps > .1).

The ASD group was reliably less \naccurate in classifying bodily expressions of anger, happiness and disgust, regardless of \nstimulus display type, and marginally but not significantly less accurate in classifying \nbodily expressions of fear and sadness. These findings broadly replicate and extend the \nresults of previous studies of bodily emotion recognition in ASD (Hubert et al., 2007; Moore \net al., 1997; Philip et al., submitted). The ASD group was also impaired relative to the TD \ngroup in discriminating translational coherent motion from random-dot kinematograms. \nFurthermore, as predicted, ASD individuals with higher motion coherence thresholds were \nless accurate in classifying emotions from body movements, especially in the point-light \ndisplays. No such relationship between log-scaled motion coherence thresholds and emotion \nclassification accuracy was evident in the TD group. The reason for this latter finding is \nuncertain and deserves further investigation; one possible reason is that TD individuals \nwith higher motion coherence thresholds employed a compensatory strategy, perhaps \nrelying more on different perceptual mechanisms, which the ASD individuals were less \nable to employ.\nThese results are consistent with the hypothesis that impaired recognition of bodily \nexpressed emotions in ASD is at least partly attributable to a deficit in visual motion \nPage 15 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nBodily emotion recognition and motion coherence in ASD 15\nprocessing, as opposed to being an entirely higher-level deficit in attributing emotions or \nmental states more generally. It was reasoned that impaired discrimination of simple coherent \nmotion would be associated with impaired ability to classify emotions from body movements \nbecause detection of coherent motion requires integration of more global than local motion \nsignals, and successful discrimination and recognition of bodily expressed emotions relies to \nsome extent on the processing of bodily kinematics, which in turn also requires integration of \nrelatively global motion signals.\nThe ASD group was also less accurate than the TD group in classifying whole-\nbody non-instrumental actions from point-light and full-light displays. This finding is \nconsistent with there being a difficulty associated with ASD in processing bodily \nkinematics, given the more prominent role such cues play in the identification of non-\ninstrumental compared to instrumental actions (Dittrich, 1993). However, action \nclassification accuracy was unrelated to motion coherence thresholds. There are at least \ntwo possible reasons for this. One reason is as follows. There is growing evidence that \nsuccessful discrimination of bodily movements or actions depends on the relative \nbalance of different visual cues \u2013 kinematics, featural and configural motion and form \ncues \u2013 and that the relative contributions of these cues varies depending on the type of \naction and on task requirements (e.g., Atkinson et al., 2007b; Dittrich, 1993; Loucks & \nBaldwin, 2009). Moreover, there is evidence that distinct neural systems process these \ndifferent cues and thus subserve the perception of different types of movement (e.g., \nGallagher & Frith, 2004; Lestou et al., 2008). Thus the reason that motion coherence \nthresholds were related to accuracy in judging emotions but not instrumental or non-\ninstrumental actions might be that discrimination of emotionally expressive movements \nrelies more on cues requiring relatively global motion and form processing, such as \nkinematic and configural cues, than does the discrimination of non-instrumental and \nPage 16 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nBodily emotion recognition and motion coherence in ASD 16\nespecially instrumental actions, which relies more on the processing of relatively local \nmotion and form cues. Alternatively, the reason might simply be that there was not \nenough variation in action classification scores, as a consequence of the task being too \neasy. These two possible reasons are not mutually exclusive and both deserve further \ninvestigation.\nWhat neural mechanisms might underlie this relationship between the abilities to \nperceive global, coherent motion and to recognize emotions from body movements? One \nrecent model emphasizes that the perception of human body movements involves the \nspatiotemporal integration of local motion and local form signals (Giese & Poggio, 2003). \nAnother recent model proposes that the perception of body movement is achieved via the \ntemporal integration of global static body form (Lange & Lappe, 2006). Both models are \nconsistent with impaired bodily emotion recognition being associated with impaired \nperception of coherent or global motion, and central to both is the superior temporal sulcus \n(STS). The STS, especially its posterior aspect, has an important role in the visual analysis of \nbody and facial movement (Puce & Perrett, 2003) and may be involved with the \ninterpretation of any social signal with a temporal component (Calder & Young, 2005). The \nSTS also has associated roles in the detection of agency and the interpretation of other \npeople's actions (Frith & Frith, 2003; Pelphrey & Morris, 2006).\nASD is associated with compromised functioning of a neural network critically \ninvolving regions in and around the STS (e.g., Dakin & Frith, 2005; Frith, 2001; Zilbovicius \net al., 2006). For example, individuals with ASD show reduced STS activation in response to \na variety of socially relevant motion stimuli, including body movements (Freitag et al., 2008; \nHerrington et al., 2007) and emotional face movements (Pelphrey et al., 2007). Functional \nabnormalities of the fusiform cortex have also been widely reported in ASD, principally in \nresponse to faces (e.g., Hadjikhani et al., 2007; Pierce et al., 2001; Schultz et al., 2003); there \nPage 17 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nBodily emotion recognition and motion coherence in ASD 17\nis also evidence of structural abnormalities in this region (van Kooten et al., 2008) as well as \nof abnormal functional connectivity of the fusiform with frontal regions and the amygdala \n(Kleinhans et al., 2008; Koshino et al., 2008). The fusiform gyrus contains one of two regions \nselective for human body form (Peelen & Downing, 2005), the other being the extrastriate \nbody area (Downing et al., 2001), and in TD adults the activity of both these regions is \nselectively enhanced by emotional compared to neutral full-light body movements, as is the \nactivity of the amygdala (Peelen et al., 2007). It has recently been reported that individuals\nwith ASD, unlike TD individuals, did not show increased activation to fearful compared to \nneutral static body postures in the fusiform and amygdala, amongst other brain regions \n(Hadjikhani et al., 2009), or to fearful compared to neutral bodies irrespective of whether \nthey were static or dynamic, in the amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus and premotor \ncortex (Gr\u00e8zes et al., 2009). Moreover, relative to a TD group, ASD individuals showed \nsignificantly reduced activation to dynamic v. static bodies, irrespective of whether they \nwere fearful or neutral gestures, in several brain regions, including right STS and \nfusiform, but showed a similar level of activation in STS for fearful v. neutral gestures \nirrespective of whether they were static or dynamic (Gr\u00e8zes et al., 2009). Atypical \npatterns of functional connectivity were also found in the ASD group, including a lack \nof change in connectivity strength when viewing fearful compared to neutral bodies \nbetween amygdala and each of STS, premotor cortex and inferior frontal gyrus (Gr\u00e8zes \net al., 2009). Future research should examine the relationship between impairments in \nglobal motion perception and the recognition of a range of emotions in ASD in the \ncontext of compromised functioning of and connectivity between these key brain \nregions.\nPage 18 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nBodily emotion recognition and motion coherence in ASD 18\nFootnotes\n1. In point-light displays the only visible elements are small lights or patches attached to the \nmajor joints and head of the actor, which minimizes or eliminates static form information but \npreserves motion (including form-from-motion) information (Johansson, 1973). In full-light \ndisplays, in contrast, the whole body and head are visible but the face is not (Atkinson et al., \n2004).\nPage 19 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nBodily emotion recognition and motion coherence in ASD 19\nReferences\nAshwin, C., Chapman, E., Colle, L., & Baron-Cohen, S.

VIQ: verbal intelligence \nquotient; PIQ: performance intelligence quotient; FSIQ: full-scale intelligence quotient.\nPage 28 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nBodily emotion recognition and motion coherence in ASD 28\nFigure Caption\nFigure 1.
