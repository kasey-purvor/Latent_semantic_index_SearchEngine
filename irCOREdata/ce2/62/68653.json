It arises in diverse areas of science, including, e.g.,\nchemistry, astronomy, and physiology @2#. The contemporary\nperception of synchronization in the presence of noise is in\nmany respects still based on the general theory developed by\nthe late Stratonovich @3# for phase-locked periodic oscillators\ninfluenced by noise. Although created for periodic oscilla-\ntions, the methods of the theory have also been usefully ap-\nplied to studies of the synchronization of irregular motion\n@4#. It is generally accepted that noise wrecks phase coher-\nence in synchronized systems, and thus disrupts synchroni-\nzation. However, it is now well known that in nonlinear sys-\ntems noise can often evoke a highly counterintuitive\nresponse by playing a creative role. For example, in Ref. @5#\nit was shown that external noise applied to a passive system\ncan reduce the total noise at its output. A striking example is\nstochastic resonance, in which noise added to a nonlinear\nsystem enhances its response to a useful signal ~see, e.g.,\nRef. @6#, and references therein!. Another phenomenon is\nknown as coherence resonance ~CR!, where noise induces\noscillations whose coherence depends resonantly on the\nnoise intensity. It has been studied numerically @7\u20139# and\nrecently confirmed by analog electronic experiment @10#. In\nparticular, CR was demonstrated for an equation of form x\u02d9\n5a2cos x1j(t), e.g., in Ref. @11#. Such an equation was\nearlier shown @3# to describe the phase difference of a forced\nperiodic oscillator under the influence of noise for the sim-\nplest form of phase synchronization, namely, 1:1 phase-\nlocking. Therefore, CR can be expected to manifest itself in\nthe power spectra of a 1:1 phase-locked system. But what is\nthe fundamental relationship between these two seemingly\nvery different phenomena, i.e., phase synchronization in its\nmost general form and CR? Is there any difference between\nthe mechanisms via which noise causes the breakdown of\nsynchronization for locking and suppression? How do the\nFourier spectra evolve with noise intensity?\nIn the present paper we demonstrate that in the course of\ndisrupting either kind of synchronization, i.e., locking or\nsuppression, noise induces a new coherent motion marked by\nthe appearance of an additional peak in the spectral density\nof oscillations. There is an optimal value of noise intensity1063-651X\/2002\/65~4!\/041105~4!\/$20.00 65 0411that maximizes the height of this peak, and thus the regular-\nity of the corresponding motion. It is therefore a form of CR.\nIt arises for almost any point within the region of locking;\nwhereas, in the region of suppression, it occurs only near the\nboundary. Due to the generality of the synchronization\nmechanisms our results are applicable to any n:m resonance.\nThe harmonically forced Van der Pol oscillator has long\nbeen used as a paradigm for the exploration of synchroniza-\ntion phenomena. In the presence of noise it can be described\nby\nx\u02d9 5y ,\ny\u02d9 5\u00ab~12x2!y2v0\n2x1C sin Vt1Dj~ t !. ~1!\nHere \u00ab50.2 is the nonlinearity parameter, v051.0 and V\nare, respectively, the frequencies of self-oscillation and of\nexternal forcing, C is the forcing strength, and j represents\nGaussian white noise of zero mean and unity variance whose\nintensity is D. In our study we used both numerical simula-\ntions and analogue electronic modelling techniques @12#.\nFigure 1 shows schematically the analog circuit used for\nmodeling of Eq. ~1! @13#. The voltages at points A and B\ncorrespond to the x and y coordinates of system ~1!, respec-\ntively.\nThe noiseless case D50 has been discussed, e.g., in Ref.\n@1#. It was shown that, for a certain relationship between the\namplitude C and frequency V of the external forcing one can\nsynchronize self-oscillations so that the frequencies of the\nsystem and of the external perturbation become related as\nFIG. 1.

Thus, n:m synchronization\noccurs. In the (C ,V) parameter plane, the regions of syn-\nchronization form so-called Arnold tongues @14#. A portion\nof the 1:1 synchronization region for Eq. ~1! is plotted in Fig.\n2. There are two distinct synchronization mechanisms,\nnamely, via phase locking and via suppression of natural\noscillations, which are associated with two different bifurca-\ntions @1#. Curve B divides the Arnold tongue into two parts in\nwhich the structure of the phase space is qualitatively differ-\nent. The system can therefore be expected to respond differ-\nently to noise in different regions of the parameter plane.\nWe now present the results of experimental and numerical\ninvestigations of noise-induced effects in an initially syn-\nchronized system. First, consider the lower part of the Arnold\ntongue of Eq. ~1! close to the synchronization boundary ~Fig.\n2!. We set the external forcing parameters as C50.06, V\n51.0118 for 1:1 synchronization and C50.3, V50.33216\nfor 1:3 synchronization. Figure 3 shows how the oscillation\nspectra evolve as the noise intensity is increased @15#, as\nestablished by analogue electronic experiments. It is clearly\nevident that, in addition to periodic oscillations arising from\nresonant behavior between self-sustained oscillations and\nFIG. 2.

Spectral density of oscillations versus noise intensity D\nin the analogue experiment for ~a! 1:1 synchronization, ~b! 1:3 syn-\nchronization.04110forcing, a new timescale is introduced by noise. It manifests\nitself through the appearance of a new spectral peak beside\n~here to the left of! the main one corresponding to synchro-\nnized oscillations. The position of the latter is the same as in\nthe absence of noise and the mean frequency is the integral\naverage of these two peaks.\nNote that, unlike the case of stochastic resonance, noise\ndoes not enhance the system\u2019s response to the applied forc-\ning. Instead, it gives rise to a new motion whose frequency\ndiffers from those of the already existing processes. The phe-\nnomenon is seen more clearly in Fig. 3~b! for 1:3 synchro-\nnization, where the three spectral peaks are well distin-\nguished; whereas for 1:1 synchronization we can see only\ntwo peaks, because the self-oscillation peak coincides with\nthat of forcing due to synchronization. Numerical simula-\ntions have yielded very similar results. The heights and\nwidths of the noise-induced peaks change with variation of\nthe noise intensity; the coherence or regularity of the new\nmotion must presumably vary in a similar way.\nTo quantify the coherence or regularity of the oscillations\ncorresponding to the new spectral peak we use a quantity\nthat can be interpreted as a signal-to-noise ratio b\n5Hvp \/Dv , where H is the height of the peak at the fre-\nquency vp and Dv is the peak width at the height H\/2.\nFigure 4 displays the dependence of the new peak\u2019s regular-\nity b on noise intensity D ~a! for 1:1 and ~b! for 1:3 fre-\nquency locking as determined by numerical simulation and\nanalog experiment. In both graphs the coherence maxima are\nwell defined, constituting evidence for coherence resonance.\nThe numerical and analogue results are in satisfactory agree-\nment. We can conclude therefore that, as the noise intensity\nin the initially synchronized system increases, the transition\nfrom the synchronous to the asynchronous regime involves\npassage through another coherent motion with an additional\nFIG. 4.

The regularity b of the main\npeak, corresponding to the initially synchronized motion de-\ncreases monotonically with noise intensity ~see insets!: so it\nseems that the proximity of the whole system\u2019s dynamics to\nbeing quasiperiodic is maximal when the regularity of noise-\ninduced motion is maximal, that is, for the optimal value of\nD. For small noise intensity the contribution from the new\npeak to the common motion is very small, and oscillations of\nthe system are close to the unperturbed periodic dynamics,\nbut for strong noise all coherence is destroyed. Similar spec-\ntral evolution was observed for other values of the param-\neters C and A within the synchronization tongue below line B\nin Fig. 2.\nWe now consider how noise can generate a new coherent\nmotion on the way to destroying synchronization. Consider\nfirst the lower part of the Arnold tongue. Here, a resonant\ntorus exists in the phase space. Its structure can better be\nvisualized in Poincare\u00b4 section @Fig. 5~a!#. It is formed by\nunstable manifolds of the saddle cycle, which are closed on\nthe stable cycle. In the absence of noise the stable cycle\nattracts all trajectories in the vicinity of the resonant torus.\nAs one leaves the tongue through the curve SN, the saddle\nand stable cycles merge and disappear, representing the bi-\nfurcational manifestation of phase locking breakdown.\nLet us assume that the minimal distance along the torus\nbetween the saddle and stable cycles is less than half of the\ntorus circumference. When noise is applied, fluctuations can\nthrow the trajectory outside the region bounded by stable\nmanifolds of the saddle cycle ~SC! @far right in Fig. 5~a!#,\nafter which the trajectory returns rapidly to the stable cycle C\nalong the unstable manifold of SC. Thus an additional rota-\ntion around the torus appears, corresponding to phase slips.\nIf the noise is very small, the slips occur rarely; and as the\nnoise intensity grows, the slips appear more frequently. But it\nis clear that very strong noise will simply smear the whole\ndynamics. Therefore, the regularity of the new motion will\ndepend nonmonotonically on the noise intensity. This situa-\ntion is very similar to that described in Ref. @7#. An important\ndifference in the present case, however, is that events take\nplace on the resonant torus surface. This means that the fre-\nquency of the noise-induced oscillatory component at birth\nwill be close to that of the synchronized oscillations ~see Fig.\n3!, rather than close to zero as in Ref. @7#. Strictly speaking,\nthe new timescale will be defined by the times needed to\nthrow the trajectory from vicinity of stable cycle, and of\nrotation around the torus which, in terms of Ref. @8#, are the\nFIG. 5.

Note that,\ninside the region where the resonant torus exists ~below\ncurve B in Fig. 2!, the noise is almost always able to induce\ncoherent motion. An exception is the ~improbable! degener-\nate situation that arises where distances along the torus sur-\nface between the stable and unstable cycles are exactly the\nsame, whether moving clockwise or anticlockwise.\nNow, consider the upper part of the synchronization\ntongue. Here, there is no torus in the phase space, and the\none stable limit cycle that exists @Fig. 5~b!# attracts all tra-\njectories from a certain vicinity. The mechanism of noise-\ninduced coherent motion described above then becomes im-\npossible. The properties of the attracting cycle C differ\nbetween different regions of the upper part of the tongue.\nNamely, between curves T and A the trajectories tend to C\nwhile rotating along spirals, as shown in Fig. 5~b!. But in the\nregion bounded by curves A and B this rotation is absent.\nThus if noise perturbs the system in the former case, a com-\npetition between two types of motion may be inferred, i.e.,\nrotation along a spiral will interact with fluctuational motion.\nThis situation is related to that described in Ref. @9#, where\nthe effect of noise on two coupled discrete maps was studied.\nNoise will kick the trajectory from the stable cycle evoking\nrotations along spirals, that is, inducing coherent oscillations.\nHowever, it is clear that the rotations themselves are also\naffected by fluctuations and that strong noise will just smear\nthem. Thus, for a certain moderate noise we can expect\nmaximally coherent motion around the stable cycle, i.e., the\noccurrence of CR.\nTo test this inference, we set C50.48 and V51.129,\nclose to the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation line T inside the\nsynchronization region ~Fig. 2! and followed the evolution of\nthe spectrum of oscillations with increasing noise intensity\n@Fig. 6~a!#. As before, noise gives rise to a new spectral peak\nwhose width and height are controlled by noise intensity. The\nmeasured regularity b of the new motion is plotted in Fig.\n6~b!. It is interesting that for synchronization via suppres-\nsion, b also exhibits a nonmonotonic variation with D.\nAgain, the analog and numerical results are in satisfactory\nagreement.\nFIG. 6.

The notation is as in Fig. 4.5-3\nBALANOV, JANSON, POSTNOV, AND McCLINTOCK PHYSICAL REVIEW E 65 041105In marked contrast, inside the region bounded by curves A\nand B in Fig. 2, increasing noise intensity leads only to the\ngrowth of a noisy background in the spectra, and thus no\ncoherent motion is generated. To summarize, we have dem-\nonstrated that noise applied to a synchronized system plays a\ndual role. On the one hand, it disrupts synchronization. But\nat the same time it produces a new ordered motion whose\ncoherence depends resonantly on the noise intensity. There is\nan optimal value of noise intensity which produces maxi-\nmally regular biperiodic oscillations, and thus CR. The un-\nderlying CR mechanisms differ for synchronization via fre-\nquency and phase locking and via suppression of the natural\ndynamics. For locking, the noise induces rotations along the\ntorus, transverse to the stable cycle lying on it. It looks like\nphase slips, whose frequency depends on the noise intensity.04110For suppression, noise induces rotations around what is the\nonly stable cycle in the system. The present results are inter-\nesting, not only in terms of fundamental physics, but also\nbecause they may also be relevant to a range of interdiscipli-\nnary problems, e.g., in neuroscience and biology, where syn-\nchronization phenomena occur in the presence of fluctua-\ntions.\nWe are grateful to D.
