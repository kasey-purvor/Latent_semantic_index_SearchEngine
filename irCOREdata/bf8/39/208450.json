In its classical formulations, \nrepublicanism is far from woman-friendly. Indeed, there seem few traditions worse suited to \nalliance with feminism than one that has viewed freedom as a matter of what goes on in the \npublic rather than private realm, and has regarded the homely activities of the domestic sphere \nas a drain on the manly heroisms of public life. Yet there have been moves in recent years to \nrealign feminism with the republican tradition, one measure of this being the unexpected revival \nof interest in Hannah Arendt. Once dismissed as hopelessly 'male-stream' in her contempt for \nhousehold idiocy and glorification of the public realm\n2\n, Arendt has since been recruited as a \npotential source for women's movement politics. Mary Dietz sees her as an important counter-\nweight to those strands of feminism that have sentimentalised the virtues of the private sphere, \nand describes her as providing feminist thinkers 'with a way to proceed towards politics'.\n3\n A \nrecent collection is entirely devoted to feminist interpretations of Hannah Arendt.\n4\n   \n Republicanism is being reclaimed as one of the formative influences on feminism - \nperhaps as influential as the liberalism that once took most of the credit\n5\n - and a number of \ntheorists argue that women would do well to draw more closely on this heritage. It has been \n  \n 2 \nsuggested that feminism could consolidate its already strong commitment to participatory \ndemocracy if it aligned itself with the republican rather than liberal tradition\n6\n; that such an \nalignment would make it easier to detach the case for women's political representation from \nnarrow notions about women representing only women\u2019s interests7; or make it easier for \nfeminists to distance themselves from the divisiveness of identity politics.\n8\n  \nIn her introduction to a collection of readings on Feminism, the Public and the \nPrivate,\n9\n Joan Landes makes the point that the feminist preoccupation with personal life should \nnot be seen as a backing away from public participation. On the contrary, since feminist politics \nhas been very much about making public matters that were previously considered private, it has \nusually attached great weight to activities in the public sphere. In recent years, this more \u2018public\u2019 \nface of feminism has been most evident in the critical dialogue that has developed with \nHabermasian analyses of the public sphere\n10\n and, more generally, in feminist explorations of \ncommunicative and deliberative democracy\n11\n, for much of the work on civic republicanism has \ntaken a communitarian turn that many feminists find more troubling. But whether the links with \nrepublicanism are direct or tangential, there is undoubtedly a new focus in feminist writing on \nthe nature of the public sphere. Discussions that once focused on feminism's uneasy positioning \nbetween liberal and socialist traditions now more commonly invoke republicanism as well. \n           Why Republicanism? \nThis revival of interest parallels a wider recuperation in contemporary political thought. \nInspired particularly by the work of J.G.A.Pocock and Quentin Skinner\n12\n, historians of ideas \nhave been excavating a distinctively republican tradition from the distortions and \nmisrepresentations that piled up in subsequent centuries; in doing so, they have significantly \naltered our understanding of the Western political heritage.\n13\n For most of those involved in this \nprocess of historical correction, the recuperation of republicanism has been a political as well as \n  \n 3 \nintellectual project. Variously called upon as a critique of liberalism, totalitarianism, and the \nvapidity of mass society, the tradition has provided an alternative vantagepoint from which to \nview the inadequacies of the contemporary world.  \nHannah Arendt was a crucial early figure in this realignment, and in Arendt\u2019s diagnosis \nof twentieth century ailments, just about everything one could think of had gone wrong. In its \nterrifying combination of 'reckless optimism' with 'reckless despair'\n14\n, totalitarianism had \nabdicated responsibility for human action and choice: no need to agonise over what is just or \nlegitimate; put yourself at the service of inexorable forces; let the ends justify the means. In the \nmore protected zones of constitutional democracy, there was also little cause for celebration. \nArendt saw the political order being downgraded to the status of a marketplace, with politics \nbecoming the pursuit of interest or administration of economic growth. Even the more humane \nconcern with poverty or hunger was, in her view, an abdication of political freedom, for when \nthe poor 'appeared on the scene of politics, necessity appeared with them.... freedom had to be \nsurrendered to necessity, to the urgency of the life-process itself'.\n15\n People had come to believe \nthey lived in a free republic if they only had their civil rights and freedoms; but they had \nmistaken the 'preliminaries of civilised government'\n16\n for its substance, and forgotten that \n'political freedom, generally speaking, means the right \"to be a participator in government\", or it \nmeans nothing.'\n17\n In pursuit of first the necessities and later the luxuries of life, people had lost \ntheir taste for public freedom. Politics had effectively disappeared. \n On a number of points, Arendt's version of republicanism has become deeply \nunfashionable. Few now endorse the preference she suggested for direct over representative \ndemocracy, while no-one argues that the vitality of public life depends on keeping 'social' \nquestions about poverty or hunger so resolutely out of debate. Most also distance themselves \nfrom an element that was never part of Arendt's thinking: the image of the republic as a \n  \n 4 \nhomogeneous community reaching agreement on its common good. At a deeper level, however, \nlate twentieth century discussions of republicanism have continued to develop the thesis about \nthe individual getting the better of the citizen, and J.G.A.Pocock has described his work on civic \nhumanism as telling its story 'in terms borrowed from or suggested by the language of Hannah \nArendt'\n18\n. Among political philosophers, the continuities have been particularly marked: \nSheldon Wolin's analysis of the history of Western political thought as the history of the \nsubordination of politics to society\n19\n; Michael Sandel's contention that democracy is now valued \nonly as a way of securing people in the pursuit of their private (by implication, rather sordid) \ninterests and ends\n20\n; or Benjamin Barber's critique of liberal politics as akin to zoo-keeping, \ndedicated only to keeping the wild beasts apart.\n21\n \n In its later twentieth-century incarnation, republicanism has come to revolve around \nthree themes. (None of these, it should be noted, has much to say on the more popular \nunderstanding of republicanism as a critique of monarchical power). There is a distaste for \ninterest-group pluralism as reducing politics to an amoral bargaining and exchange; a \ndissatisfaction with definitions of freedom as merely the freedom from coercion or interference; \nand a perception that contemporary societies are experiencing a worrying decline in the quality \nof their public life. Interest-group pluralism had been criticised by Marxists for glossing over the \nsystemic inequalities that leave one group incomparably more powerful than another. From the \nperspective of the latter-day republican, the further problem is that the huckstering and \nbargaining of contemporary politics leaves no space for considerations of what is right or just, \nno space for deliberation on public affairs. When public policy is treated as a by-product of \ncompeting private interest (in Harold Lasswell's famous phrase, a matter of who gets what, \nwhen, and how), this not only disadvantages the weaker groups in society. It also empties the \n'public' of any real meaning, making a mockery of notions of the public good. For most of those \n  \n 5 \nwho develop this theme, the intention is not to resuscitate Rousseauian fantasies of a general \nwill; most contemporary republicans have been as suspicious as anyone of appeals to a unified \ncommon good. But public interest should not be treated just as an amalgam of private \npreferences. Public life should be more than a vehicle for looking after one's own. \n The second theme addresses what has become a dominant understanding of freedom in \nmodern liberal democracies: the notion that individuals are free so long as no-one interferes \nwith them, so long as no-one stops them doing what they have chosen to do. Here too, there has \nbeen a classically Marxist critique, to the effect that it is nonsensical to describe people as free \njust because no-one holds a gun to their heads, and that failing the material resources that enable \npeople to activate their so-called choices, 'freedom' remains an empty word. The republican \nresponse (particularly as developed in works by Quentin Skinner and Philip Pettit\n22\n) focuses \nmore on relations of dependency and domination. If freedom were simply a matter of non-\ninterference, we might have to say that a slave left alone by a lazy or absentee master enjoyed \nfull liberty; or that a wife cherished by her accommodating husband was as free as a bird, even \nwhen the laws of her society denied her any independent status. In the republican conception, \nneither of these would make much sense. A people that lives at the discretion of its rulers cannot \nbe described as free, even when fortunate enough to live under rulers who choose not to \ninterfere. Servitude is servitude even when the master is accommodating. The only free people \nare those who govern themselves.  \n The third concern that underpins much of the current interest in republicanism is the \nbelief that modernity has tipped the balance from the public towards the private, reduced the \nrole of public discussion or the use of public space, and generally contributed to what Richard \nSennett calls 'the fall of public man'.\n23\n  Some explain this by reference to a proceduralist \nliberalism that backs away from substantive public discussion of disputed issues of politics or \n  \n 6 \nmorality, and tries to cope with the pluralism of modern society by leaving more matters up to \nthe individuals themselves.\n24\n But the processes at work are also economic and social: a \ncontinuing marketisation that turns previously public activities into matters for private \nconsumption; a pre-packaging of opinions through the mass media that discourages political \ndialogue and deliberation; an intensification of labour that leads people to seek their fulfilment \nprimarily at home. Though the details are continually contested, there is a widely shared \nperception that public life has been impoverished and public spiritedness is on the decline. \nMuch of the current interest in republicanism speaks to this concern. \n                    Feminist Connections \nOn each of these themes, there are points of contact and points of contention with feminist \nthinking. This is not only because feminisms are various, ranging through almost every point on \nthe liberal\/communitarian axis or every point in the modernity\/post-modernity debate. It is also, \nmore interestingly, because those drawn to the republican tradition have also turned out to be \nthose most critical of the way its exponents develop their themes. The critique of interest-driven \npolitics, for example, has been welcomed for the way it opens up the possibility of a politics \ndevoted to justice, but simultaneously condemned for depriving women of their distinct or \nseparate voice. The critique of dependency resonates powerfully with a long history of women\u2019s \nmovement politics, but to the extent that it conceives of independence as a political \u2013 rather than \nsocial and economic \u2013 condition, it is also out of tune with many later preoccupations. The \nimportance attached to the sphere of public life speaks volumes to the women who have long \nfelt excluded from this sphere, but also infuriates with its seeming disparagement of those \nactivities that have continued to define most women\u2019s lives. The resulting ambiguities make for \na complex relationship, which is best understood against the background of feminism\u2019s \npersistent unease with the liberal tradition. Feminism was born (in a sense) out of liberalism, but \n  \n 7 \nhas nearly always been at odds with its origins, and feminists have long sought inspiration in \ntraditions that contest the liberal hegemony. For many post-sixties\u2019 feminists, it was a revised \nversion of socialism that provided the framework for this, but as socialism lost its organising \npower (partly because of those feminist revisions) it became necessary to look elsewhere. Part \nof the contemporary attraction of republicanism is that it offers a substitute for socialism as a \nway of maintaining the necessary distance from the liberal tradition. \n1. Interest \nThe republican critique of interest-group politics resonates with a longstanding feminist \ndissatisfaction with the politics of the marketplace: a perception that the politics of bargains and \ncontracts will reinforce the position of those groups that are already more powerful; but also a \ndeeper perception that it is at odds with female experience. The relationship of mothers to \nchildren, for example, often involves putting the needs of others above one\u2019s own, and a \nconcern for the empowerment of one\u2019s children who will then grow away from one into \nindependence. Redescribing this in terms of a rational pursuit of long-term interest (you do your \nbest for your children either because they are \u2018your own\u2019 or so that they can repay you at some \nlater stage) hardly captures the nature of this relationship, and feminist reflection on this has \ngenerated a substantial literature on the ethics of care.\n25\n Most feminist work on citizenship and \ndemocracy draws on this to some extent, and it is widely argued that the inclusion of women as \nfull citizens should alter the texture of democratic politics as well as its personnel.\n26\n The \nobsession with self and self-ownership is a luxury few women have been able to afford; to this \nextent, it has been felt to reflect a very masculine conception of politics. \n The second reason why interest seems such a poor vehicle for feminist concerns is that it \nsuggests something pre-given and fixed. Underlying virtually all feminist politics is a belief that \nwe have grown up in inequitable power relations, and that women, as well as men, may \n  \n 8 \ninternalise these relations to make them seem inevitable or right. It is only rarely that people can \nmake the imaginative leap into entirely different relations and the claims we then make (or the \ninterests we express) often appear as mild variants on current conditions. Thus, mothers living \nin a society that has long practised female genital mutilation may well express the wish that \ntheir daughters should be operated on in more hygienic conditions than they experienced \nthemselves, but may find it harder simply to refuse the operation because of a fear that this will \nmake their daughters unmarriageable. Wives living in a society that has long allocated all the \ndomestic labour to women may express a wish that men should take more of their share, but \noften find the demand for total equalisation inappropriate, utopian, \u2018unnatural\u2019. Freud was not \nthe only one to feel confused about what women want, for wants are formed under the \nconstraints of existing conditions, and they alter when new possibilities emerge. One problem \nwith the interest-driven conception of politics is that it finds it hard to address this phenomenon. \nThis makes it a poor vehicle for any politics that is about challenging deep structures and age-\nold relations. \nFor both these reasons, feminists find much that is congenial in the republican critique, \nbut usually stop short at the point where republicanism threatens to abandon a belief in conflicts \nof interest. Particularly in its incarnations in the USA (where there is an understandable \nrevulsion against what political scientists term 'pork-barrel' politics), civic republicanism has \ncome to be associated with ideals of transcendence, with appeals to citizens to turn away from \ntheir selfish, parochial preoccupations to address matters of more general concern. Invoking \nideals of public virtue against private selfishness, many republicans look to the institutions of \nself-government to achieve something grander than just the protection of individual or group \ninterest: something more along the lines of just laws, the greatest mutual benefit, perhaps \neven that old chestnut, the common good.  Sandel, for example, not only sets a high value on \n  \n 9 \npublic service and political participation. He also sees freedom as depending on the \nwillingness to put the common good above private interests and concerns. This rings alarm \nbells for feminists, many of whom will ask what guarantee there is that women's interests and \npreoccupations will be incorporated into this \u2018common\u2019 good. Almost by definition, women's \npolitics insists on there being some difference between men's and women's interests \u2013 some \ndifference and also some conflict - and it is often the moment when women come to recognise \nthis difference that sparks off their mobilisation. \u2018From the vantage-point of women\u2019s history,\u2019 \nwrites Mary Ryan, \u2018the identification of a political interest of one\u2019s own was not a fall from \npublic virtue but a step towards empowerment\u201927 Women have typically had to shake \nthemselves loose from submissiveness, to make themselves less rather than more self-denying, \nand this experience puts a more positive gloss on assertions of self or group interest. \n Joan Landes notes that 'when women during the French Revolution and the \nnineteenth century attempted to organize in public on the basis of their interests, they risked \nviolating the constitutive principles of the bourgeois public sphere: in place of one, they \nsubstituted the many; in place of disinterestedness, they revealed themselves to have an \ninterest.'\n28\n  The most misogynist elements of republicanism have disappeared from late \ntwentieth century variants, and there is now little of that celebration of manly heroisms, and \nassociated disdain for the \u2018mere\u2019 female, that can be observed in earlier versions. But \nwherever republicanism comes to celebrate disinterestedness or generality, it threatens to \nundercut what has been a persistent feminist concern. As Iris Young famously argued in her \ncritique of Benjamin Barber: 'In a society where some groups are privileged while others are \noppressed, insisting that as citizens persons should leave behind their particular affiliations \nand experiences to adopt a general point of view serves only to reinforce that privilege; for \nthe perspectives and interests of the privileged will tend to dominate this unified public, \n  \n 10 \nmarginalizing or silencing those of other groups.'\n29\n Premature appeals to disinterestedness or \nimpartiality place a particularly heavy burden on groups that are just beginning to articulate \ntheir distinctive concerns, twisting assertions of need into claims of pure selfishness and \nreducing people to silence again. \n Consider in this context Robert Putnam's analysis of civic traditions in modern Italy, \nwhich turns partly on a discussion of the personal preference vote. At the time of his analysis, \nItalian elections were conducted on the basis of party lists, with voters having the additional \nopportunity to indicate their preference between individuals. In Putnam's comparison between \nNorth and South - between regions with a strong sense of civic involvement and others where \npatron-client politics still prevails - he sees the use of the personal preference vote as \nindicating the absence of a civic community. '(I)n the least civic regions, such as Calabria, \nvoters are brought to the polls not by issues, but by hierarchical patron-client networks'. 'More \nthan half of the citizens in the civic regions have never cast a preference ballot in their lives; \nmore than half of the voters in the less civic regions say they always have.'\n30\n  \nOne can see, of course, what he means. There is a difference between voting for \nsomeone who shares your political aspirations and voting for someone who knows your father \nor has promised you a job, and the first suggests a more vibrant and informed political culture \nthan the second. The example recalls, however, broadly similar voting systems that operate \nelsewhere in Europe, where the opportunity to indicate a personal preference has been \nexploited by women's groups to raise the proportion of women elected. Putnam sees the 'good \npolity' as characterised by the citizens' engagement with public issues and corresponding lack \nof interest in personalities, but for anyone seeking to challenge the male monopoly on \npolitics, this is an oversharp dichotomy. When citizens abdicate to the party the responsibility \nfor ranking individuals, they may be saying (in good republican fashion) that their votes are \n  \n 11 \nnot for purchase and their support entirely a matter of political programmes and ideas. But \nthis lack of interest in the individual also commits them to saying they do not care whether \nthe preferred candidate is male or female, white or black, from an over-represented majority \nor an under-represented minority. Feminists cannot afford to be so disdainful of \u2019personal\u2019 \ndifference. Indeed, anyone concerned about the under-representation of subordinated social \ngroups has to regard the choice of individual as an additional salient concern. Putnam\u2019s high-\nminded contrast between civic virtue and patron-client relations makes it harder to recognise \nthe legitimacy of this. \nThis emphasis on particularity and difference opens up what may seem an impossible \ndistance from republican thinking, but there is a further turn in the cycle that begins to close \nthis again. Feminism has always, in some sense, been about challenging false unities: \nchallenging the assumption that the family is a harmonious unit, that members of the same \nhousehold necessarily share the same interests, or that 'man' can stand in for 'man and woman' \nas if the two sexes would never disagree. Because of this, feminists have proved particularly \nsensitive to the further differentiations that also make 'woman' a false unity: the multiple \ndifferences between women of class, age, ethnicity, sexuality, and race. The fragmentation \nimplied in this is one problem feminism has had to face. The other is that if we put too much \nstress on difference - on the fact that people have different experiences and different interests, \nand that those with one set of experiences cannot  'stand in' for those with another - we seem \nto legitimate a vision of politics in which no-one addresses anyone else's concerns and each \njust looks after her own.  \nIf we say, for example, that men cannot be relied upon to recognise and defend \nwomen's interests (I find it hard to see how anyone could consider herself a feminist if she did \nnot argue some version of this), are we saying men should leave so-called women's concerns \n  \n 12 \nto the women and women leave men's concerns to the men? If we say that white women \ncannot be relied upon to recognise and act on the problems of racism, are we saying racism is \nonly a problem for black people and does not have to be addressed by those who are white? In \nboth cases, the first statement seems absolutely right: our different experiences do influence \nand constrain our understandings of the world, and we have to be very wary of unities that \nturn out to be false. But if the implication is that the members of one group have no \nresponsibility towards the members of another - no capacity even for understanding their \ndifferent point of view \u2013 few of us would want to pursue that road. At this point, \nrepublicanism comes back into its own, offering a more dialogic understanding of public \njustice and public good that can be a useful resource in addressing this issue. As many of \nthose developing the case for deliberative democracy have argued, the very requirement of \npublicity \u2013 having to engage with others in public, to take on board different arguments and \nperspectives, to frame our own demands in terms that will be compelling to those with whom \nwe disagree \u2013 should encourage a more transformative politics that enables everyone to move \nbeyond our initial, more local concerns. The more \u2018private\u2019 politics of the ballot box is \nunlikely to have this effect.\n31\n \n2. Dependency \nThe republican critique of dependency and domination also has obvious resonance with \nfeminism, particularly as developed in Philip Pettit\u2019s recent work. Pettit argues that the defining \ncore of the republican tradition lies less in ideals of active political participation or the pursuit \nof common interest than in the notion of freedom as non-domination, and he presents a \nversion that is far less severe in its separation of public from private concerns. On his reading, \nthe res publica side of republicanism becomes less prominent. It is exposure to the arbitrary \nwill of another that emerges as the greatest evil in the republican canon, and while most of the \n  \n 13 \nclassical literature has focused attention on exposure to tyrannical and unchecked rulers, there \nis no reason why the same concerns should not apply to the dominance of employers over \nworkers or the dominance of husbands over wives. \nPettit draws extensively on the experiences of women to clarify why living with a kindly \nmaster is still living unfree, and in doing so, echoes what has long been a feminist concern. \nWomen in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were well aware that the chains of servitude \ncould be wrought from silk and lace, and they rarely endorsed the argument that dependency is \nacceptable so long as dependants are \u2018allowed\u2019 to do what they want to do. Mary Wollstonecraft \nis one of the theorists most obviously indebted to republican thinking, and the real horror for her \nwas not women\u2019s poverty or terrible conditions of work, but their dependency on and \ndomination by men. So long as society attached such exaggerated weight to sexual difference \n(Wollstonecraft pulled no punches in identifying men as the instigators of this) then women \nwould be unable to develop their physical strength, their moral courage, or their capacities for \nrational action. Criticising 'the state of degradation to which woman is reduced'\n32\n, she argued \nthat women's senses had been inflamed and their understandings neglected. They had been \nencouraged to exaggerate their physical frailty rather than build their bodily strength; they were \nsupposed to be innocent - read ignorant; to refine their taste rather than their understanding; to \nplay off contemptible infantile airs in the attempt to excite male desire. Poorer women escaped \nthe worst effects of femininity simply because they had to work, therefore had to be strong and \ncapable. Some aristocratic women escaped the worst effects because they wielded economic \npower. But women of the middle classes had been turned into empty-headed and manipulative \nemblems of sexuality, encouraged to get their way through flattery and deceit, and taught to \nabdicate moral responsibility for their lives.   \nThe example speaks to a strong association between feminism and republicanism in \n  \n 14 \nthe formative years of feminist thinking, but it also clarifies why that association later became \nmore weak. Wollstonecraft was preoccupied with questions of dependence and independence, \ndomination and freedom, and while she saw independence as conditional on certain social \nchanges (mainly in the sphere of education), she had little of the later nineteenth century \npreoccupation with material equality as a condition for freedom. Thus, she hated aristocratic \nwealth, but more for its luxury, decadence, degenerative influence than for the inequalities it \nrepresented in terms of the distribution of income and wealth. And while acutely sensitive to \nthe harsh conditions of many working women's lives, she tended to regard poorer women \nalmost as better off than those living on higher incomes. Like many feminists trying to make \nsense of the peculiar patterns developing through late eighteenth\/ early nineteenth century \nEurope, she came to believe that the caged beauties of the middle class were more dominated, \ndegraded and infantilised than the hard-working women of the lower class. This meant, \namong other things, that Wollstonecraft saw poverty as less of a threat to liberty than \ndependency. The equality she sought was to be measured in terms of independence rather \nthan income or positioning in the social division of labour; and she saw no intrinsic reason \nwhy men and women could not be equally independent even while assuming very different \nresponsibilities and roles.  \nThis is the point that has proved so troubling to later feminists, for Wollstonecraft \ndoes not seem particularly perturbed by a division of labour that allocates familial and \ndomestic responsibilities to the women and leaves most fields of public employment to the \nmen. Some have explained this just as an understandable failure of imagination, for who \ncould have anticipated, at the end of the eighteenth century, that women might come to join \nthe labour force in equal numbers with men or men take equal responsibility for their \nchildren? (Who can anticipate this even now?) But to \u2018excuse\u2019 her in this way is itself a \n  \n 15 \nfailure of imagination, for what Wollstonecraft\u2019s arguments reveal is her deep conviction that \nit is the capacity to think and act for yourself that matters rather than one\u2019s place in the \ndivision of labour or one\u2019s level of income and wealth. What she was saying, in effect, was \nthat it matters less what you do than how you do it. You have to be free from the domination \nof others, you have to be serious not silly, you have to be governing yourself. But if these \nconditions are once met, then a woman running her household and bringing up her children \ncan be as free and worthy of respect as anyone running the country or earning vast monies in \nthe more public world of work. Indeed, for the middle class women Wollstonecraft saw as \naping the life-styles of the aristocracy - refusing to breast-feed or educate their children, \nrefusing to soil their hands on domestic labour or turn their minds to the management of their \nhome - the resumption of domestic and family responsibilities would be the real saving of \ntheir souls. \nThere is a strand of contemporary feminism that works to reclaim the value of \nmothering and therefore sounds rather similar to this. But for most of the twentieth century, \nWollstonecraft's perception that independence and self-respect come more from how you live \nyour life than from what that life consists in has been out of tune with the dominant concerns. \nThrough this century, it is the stark material inequalities between women and men that have \ncaptured most attention: the poverty and malnutrition of women struggling to feed their \nchildren on whatever their husbands passed on from their breadwinners' wage; the persistent \ngap between average male and average female earnings; the impossibly long hours women \nworked at their domestic tasks even when they also went out to work. Sometimes the \ncampaign focus has been on what we have come to term 'equality' issues: winning the right to \nthe same kind of education as boys; ending the discriminatory practices that continued to keep \nwomen out of better paid jobs and professions; battling for equality of pay. Sometimes the \n  \n 16 \nfocus has been more on what we call 'difference' issues: working to improve the health of \nmothers and children; to expand nursery provision; to secure women from the violence of \nmen. It is not that dependency has become less of an issue for twentieth century feminists, but \nthat the battle against this dependency has come to centre more decisively on social and \neconomic reform. It has also increasingly invoked visions of strict equality. \nTo be independent is, as Wollstonecraft believed, a matter of how you view yourself and \nhow you are viewed by others. But the idea that you can achieve this recognition while \ncontinuing to occupy what was traditionally a subordinate female zone has come to seem deeply \nimplausible. There are, of course, many differences that are compatible with equality: it should \nnot be necessary for us all to share the same religious or political beliefs in order to be recognised \nas equals; it should not be necessary for us to enjoy the same music or eat the same food; and it \ncertainly should not be necessary for us to demonstrate the same athletic or academic capabilities. \nBut where difference has been so long overlaid with inequality \u2013 as in the different \nresponsibilities so long allocated to women and men \u2013 it is hard to out one\u2019s confidence in a \nscenario that promises full equality and independence yet leaves us attached to different spheres \nof activity. The point here is that feminist analysis of women's subordination has been profoundly \ninfluenced by the materialism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and the more \ncomprehensive egalitarianism that developed out of this. This may not be intrinsically at odds \nwith republican thinking, but where republicanism focuses attention on the political framework \nwithin which we can  challenge domination, feminism is more likely to emphasise the \nbackground inequalities that contribute to this.\n33\n \n3 The public sphere \nOn the face of it, republican appeals to a revitalised public might seem to have the least to say to \nfeminist politics, but such a view would misread decades of women\u2019s campaigning for access to \n  \n 17 \nthe public realm. Feminists have been fiercely critical, of course, of the stark separation between \npublic and private, and the disparagement of the domestic and familial so often associated with \nthis. Through much of the last two centuries, however, access to the public sphere has been one \nof the defining demands of the women\u2019s movement, and women have felt acutely their loss of a \npublic life. One of the ironies, as Mary Ryan\n34\n points out, is that women's eventual incursions \ninto the public turned out to coincide with a period widely regarded as one of decline (a typical \nexperience for women, who often find themselves gaining access to jobs or institutions just at \nthe moment when these lose their power). But however critical feminists have been of the \nelevation of public over private, most have continued to view participation in public life as a \nkey constituent of human freedom. This has always been a point of contact with republican \nthinking. \n The point of dissension is that republicanism still operates with an oversharp \ndichotomy between public and private; this is also true of that wider body of literature that \naddresses the seeming decline of the public sphere. The issue here is conceptual as well as \npractical, for the allocation of men to the public and women to the private is in large part a \nconceptual move. It is not just that women turn out to occupy one corner of society while men \noccupy another; it is also \u2013 and nowadays perhaps more so - that the activities associated with \nwomen have been treated, almost by definition, as private. Women have then faced both \npractical and definitional exclusion: a practical exclusion that can be measured in their lesser \nparticipation in the labour market or world of politics; and a definitional exclusion that \noperates through categorising what they do as less political. \nThis is one of the themes Bonnie Honig develops in her discussion of Hannah Arendt. \nArendt's \u2018rigid and uncompromising public\/private distinction\u201935 was itself a political act: \nArendt saw public life as threatened by the deadening intrusion of the body  (with all its self-\n  \n 18 \nevident, and therefore to her, politically uninteresting needs) and she deployed the distinction \nbetween public and private partly as a way of protecting the sphere of political action. The \ndistinction is then far from innocent, for when that-which-has\u2013to-be-excluded overlaps so \nclosely with women\u2019s lives, it begins to figure as one of the mechanisms for keeping women \nin their place. Armed with this insight (part of what was meant by \u2018the personal is political\u2019), \nfeminists have queried the narrow definitions of the public sphere they find in the writings of \nrepublicans and their near allies. One consequence is that they are less impressed by evidence \nof a process of substantive decline. \nThus Seyla Benhabib takes Arendt to task for trying to define the public sphere in \nrelation to certain types of activity, and argues that any matter can enter public space once it \nbecomes matter of public dispute\n36\n. On this analysis, it would make no sense to cite the \nchanging subject-matter of political debate (from heroic deeds to economic needs, or even to \nthe division of housework between women and men) as evidence that public life is on the \ndecline. In similar vein, Nancy Fraser argues that it is misleading to talk of \u2018the\u2019 public sphere \n\u2013 conjuring up as this does images of a parliamentary chamber \u2013 and more illuminating to \nrefer to a multiplicity of publics, organised around different networks of public \ncommunication.\n37\n On this analysis, we could not cite citizen apathy on national issues as \ndecisive evidence of decline, for this might well coincide with a bustling proliferation of \n\u2018counterpublics\u2019 each energetically debating alternatives. The feminist critique of the \npublic\/private distinction generates a far more plural and decentred understanding of what \nconstitutes public life, and this undercuts some of the more damning analyses of political \ndecline. \nPositions on this are subtle: a jaundiced observer might even charge them with \ninconsistency. Anyone engaging with the literature on the public sphere does so out of \n  \n 19 \ndissatisfaction with a model of politics that presents it as the protection of individual \nfreedoms or promotion of individual interests, and most of those engaging with this literature \nwould say there is a deficiency, even a crisis, in contemporary public life. Many feminists \nshare this perception, even if they are more commonly found debating Habermas or the \nrelevance of deliberative democracy than engaging with republicanism per se. But feminists \nhave also wanted to contest the rigid distinction between public and private that defines so \nmuch characteristically \u2018female\u2019 activity as non-political and leaves so much of what we call \n\u2018women\u2019s issues\u2019 outside the scope of public life. So where others might look back \nnostalgically to a high point of public interaction, feminists are more prone to point out that \nthe great moments in the history of the public sphere were themselves moments of female \nexclusion; and where others might bemoan the growth of either interest or identity politics, \nfeminists are more likely to query the assumption that these are antithetical to the public \ngood. Feminists have noted stirrings of political activity in unexpected places \u2013 in some \ncases, even underground\n38\n  - and while this sometimes leads to an over-sanguine reading of \ncontemporary politics, it is an important corrective to the more doomsday scenarios that \nproject a process of historical decline.  \nConclusion \nAll this adds up to a perception of republicanism as an uneasy ally. When the tradition was \nborn out of such resolutely masculine origins, this is hardly a surprising finding. The fact that \nfeminists have simultaneously found much to admire and much to condemn is also \nunsurprising, for there is no pre-feminist tradition of political thought that can be adopted \nwholesale as a basis for sexual politics. That republicanism nonetheless attracts increasing \nfeminist interest testifies, as much as anything, to the search for an alternative to the liberal \ntradition. Feminism is very much a child of liberalism: informed by a similar critique of \n  \n 20 \nascribed positions and traditional hierarchies, a similar commitment to individual autonomy, \na similar belief that humans are born equal whatever the other characteristics of their lives. \nBut that liberal tradition developed for too long as an exclusively masculine preserve, and the \nassumptions that came to be built into it have disturbed generations of feminist activists. For \nmuch of the twentieth century, feminists sought to moderate the excesses of liberalism by \nwelding onto it some elements of socialist thinking; now that socialism is itself in disarray, \nrepublicanism looks a more likely ally. \nLiberalism is associated with the view that society is divided between many \ncompeting interests and that each has to look after its own. Socialism is associated with the \nview that solidarity comes from shared interests, and that these are overwhelmingly the \nshared interests of class. The summaries are too simplistic, but if these are the alternatives on \noffer, it is easy to understand why republicanism has come back into favour. Despite the \nproblems I have indicated  (downplaying genuine conflicts of interest, failing to recognise the \nempowerment attached to articulating distinct and separate concerns, focusing on the \npolitical, often to the exclusion of the social and economic, and idealising a once lively public \nthat was never very lively for women), this is a tradition that offers a different way of \nconceiving the relationship between self and others, and a different way of thinking about \npublic life. Any attempt to swallow it wholesale would be seriously mistaken (difficult, \nanyway, given that \u2018it\u2019 varies significantly in its current incarnations). But in that tension \nbetween insisting that different groups do have distinct and different interests and nonetheless \n projecting a vision of politics as something more than looking after yourself, a sufficiently \ncagey appropriation of republicanism offers one possible resource.  \n  \n \n  \n 21 \nNotes \n \n1\n This paper was originally written for a conference on 'The Historical Perspectives of \nRepublicanism and the Future of the European Union', held in Siena in September, 1998.
