Making an ethogram by direct observation is\nfundamental to understanding animal behavior [1]. However,\nthis approach is not feasible for some flying or diving animals that\noften spend considerable portions of their lives beyond the limit of\nhuman vision. In such cases, indirect observation via biotelemetry\nallows researchers to monitor animal behavior remotely [2].\nFurthermore, the development of animal-borne data loggers\nallows vast amounts of behavioral and physical information to\nbe recorded on multiple sensors as an animal moves through its\nenvironment. (i.e., biologging) [3\u20135]. Several types of devices, such\nas light sensors [6], digital cameras [7], and video cameras [8],\nhave been attached to animals to monitor precise behaviors. One\nof the most powerful devices used to monitor free-ranging\nbehavior is the animal-borne accelerometer, which records both\nstatic and dynamic acceleration. Static acceleration is derived from\nan animal\u2019s body pitch, while dynamic acceleration is derived from\nbody movement. From these two parameters, researchers can\nreadily identify a range of discrete behaviors [9\u201313].\nTo our knowledge, the first study to recognize the potential of\nrecording acceleration to determine behavior patterns was that of\nYoda et al. [9], in which bi-axial accelerometers were used to\ndifferentiate whether Ade\u00b4lie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae were upright,\nprone, walking, porpoising, or tobogganing. The authors discrimi-\nnated each behavior by visual observation of acceleration data. A\nmore sophisticated technique was presented by Watanabe et al. [11]\nfor the domestic cat Felis catus. They employed fast Fourier\ntransformation to characterize acceleration signals and discriminated\nseveral behavior patterns by a stepwise canonical discriminant\nanalysis supported by video-recorded data. More recently, a simple\nmethod was proposed to identify behaviors from a decision tree based\non an acceleration signal feature [12,13]. All these procedures require\nthe researcher to first create the criteria to identify each behavior [11\u2013\n14], and when a full set of information about the behavior is available,\nthis approach is very effective. However, it is often difficult to obtain\nadequate amounts of information to determine behavioral criteria for\nanimals that spend much of their time out of sight of a human\nobserver, for example in the open ocean.\nTo overcome this shortcoming, we adopted a novel two-stage\napproach to identifying animal behavior with accelerometers.\nAcceleration signals were first categorized into several behavioral\ngroups by an unsupervised classification algorithm, and then these\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 4 | e5379\ngroups were interpreted by the researcher for example as walking,\nswimming, sleeping etc. (see Guilford et al. [15]). However, in\nsome cases behaviors cannot readily be interpreted because\ninformation on basic behavior patterns is lacking. For instance,\nhumans have never directly observed sperm whale Physeter\nmacrocephalus behavior at 1000 m depth. Therefore, researchers\ncan interpret sperm whale behavior only indirectly using clues\nobtained. These are called putative behaviors. However, even if it\nis currently impossible to directly observe a certain type of\nbehavior, categorizing it as distinct from other familiar behaviors is\nan important first step to building a picture of how the animal\nfunctions and interacts with its environment.\nThe oscillation of acceleration signals derived from animal\nmovement usually changes in periodicity and intensity. The\nprocess we adopted was to generate a spectrum from acceleration\nsignals based on the continuous wavelet transformation, and then\ngroup each second of the spectrum by an unsupervised\nclassification algorithm, the k-means clustering method. For\noscillation analysis, the fast Fourier transformation has been\nwidely employed (e.g. sound analysis) [11]. However, compared to\nsound data, body acceleration data are characterized by far fewer\noscillations for each unit of time (i.e., for each distinct behavior).\nTherefore to precisely assess behavior at a localized time scale,\ncontinuous wavelet transformation is preferable as it allows small\nchanges to be detected over short time frames. Continuous wavelet\ntransformation is similar to fast Fourier transformation; the major\ndifference is that Fourier transformations are assumed to apply to\na static oscillation signals, whereas continuous wavelet transfor-\nmations are not. Although a window function enables the Fourier\ntransformation to localize an estimation of spectra in time, the\nnumber of oscillations in the signal used for the analysis is\ndependent on the signal frequency within the window. Therefore,\nthe sensitivity for detecting an oscillation is not same among\ndifferent frequency signals within the window. By comparing\ncontinuous wavelet transformations of fluctuating oscillations with\nFourier transformation, it has been shown that the wavelet\nspectrum provides an unbiased and consistent estimation of the\nFourier spectrum [16]. Recently, continuous wavelet transforma-\ntion has been applied to oscillation analysis of climate change [17],\ndisease vectors [18], and population trends [19,20]. K-means\nclustering is a well known method that is efficient for large data\nsets and which can be performed in an unsupervised way with the\nnumber of clusters as a parameter [21].\nTo examine the validity of our procedures, we collected\nacceleration data from a medium-sized, foot-propelled diving\nseabird, the European shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis. Body acceler-\nation signals associated with different behaviors have previously\nbeen classified [22,23], making this species an ideal subject for the\nstudy. In this paper, we demonstrate our newly developed\nprocedure for generating ethograms from body acceleration data\nand evaluate its performance through a comparison with the\nknown behavior profile of the European shag.\nJapanese translation of this paper is available in Text S1.\nMethods\nEthics statement\nThis study was carried out under Research Permits 15\/R\/38\nand MON\/RP\/69 and Bird Scientific Licences 4480 and 6676\nissued by Scottish Natural Heritage.\nThe study species\nThe foraging activity of European shags at the breeding colony\non the Isle of May off the south-east coast of Scotland, UK,\n(56u119N, 02u339W), has been studied extensively using VHF\ntelemetry and a variety of animal-borne logging devices including\naccelerometers [22\u201326]. Birds feed diurnally, typically making 1\u20134\nforaging trips per day during chick rearing [24], and food for the\nbrood is transported back to the colony in the parent\u2019s stomach\n[25\u201328]. They are foot-propelled pursuit-divers and, at this\ncolony, mainly feed benthically on small fish such as the lesser\nsandeel (Ammodytes marinus) and butterfish (Pholis gunnellus). Whilst\ndiving, descent and ascent through the water column is almost\nvertical. The frequency of the foot stroke used for propulsion\ndecreases significantly with depth from 5 to 2 Hz (0.2\u20130.5 sec\ncycle) [22]. Shags typically fly to and from the foraging area using\na continuous wing stroke of ca. 5.5 Hz (0.18 sec cycle) [23].\nField work\nField work was conducted on the Isle of May, Scotland during\nthe 2003 and 2006 breeding seasons. Birds (14 in 2003 and two in\n2006) brooding small to medium-sized chicks were captured on\nthe nest using a crook on the end of a long pole. Birds were sexed\nfrom voice and size (male vocalize and are larger than females),\nand a data logger was attached to the central back feathers by\nfixing two plastic cable ties and waterproof tape to a piece of\nplastic netting (3 cm65 cm) glued to the feathers with a fast-setting\nglue in 2003 and waterproof tape only in 2006. Handling time was\nless than 10 min, and after release every bird returned to its nest\nimmediately before voluntarily departing on one or more foraging\ntrips during daylight hours. Instrumented birds were recaptured in\nthe evening after completion of their final trip of the day, or the\nfollowing day, and the loggers were retrieved.\nInstruments\nAcceleration data loggers (M190L-D2GT; Little Leonardo Ltd.,\nTokyo, Japan) were used to obtain detailed information on body\nacceleration over a 24 h period (maximum 28.2 h because of\nmemory capacity). Each logger was 15 mm in diameter, 53 mm in\nlength, had a mass of 18 g in air and recorded depth (1 Hz), two-\ndimensional acceleration (64 Hz, only one axis was used in this\nstudy), and temperature (data not used in this study). It is possible\nthat energy expenditure during a trip might be increased in\ninstrumented birds. However, the mass of the data logger in air\nwas only ca. 1% of the body mass of male and female European\nshags (18966121 and 1619699 g respectively; means6s.d.), and\nweighed markedly less than the typical load of fish brought back\nafter a foraging trip (mean 106 g) [27]. Furthermore, there was no\nevidence of any obvious disruption to attendance behavior in the\ninstrumented birds. We therefore assumed that the data collected\nwere representative of normal behavior.\nLoggers were positioned so as to detect longitudinal (surge)\naccelerations (Fig. 1). Values recorded by the accelerometers were\nconverted into acceleration (m s22) with linear regression\nequations. To obtain the calibration equations, values recorded\nby each logger at 90u and 290u from the horizontal were\nregressed against the corresponding acceleration (9.8 m s22 and\n29.8 m s22, respectively). Loggers measured both dynamic\nacceleration (such as wing stroking activity) and static acceleration\n(such as gravity). Thus, the amplitude of the surge acceleration\nrepresents the component of gravitational acceleration that\nchanges in response to the posture of the bird when not moving.\nThis enabled us to determine the orientation of the tag, which in\nturn relates to the posture of a bird, i.e., whether it was standing up\nor sitting down. Several behavior patterns were identified by\ncomparing the acceleration profiles by eye with known informa-\ntion (Fig. 2) [9,22,23]. The instrumented birds made between two\nAutomated Etho-Analysis\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 4 | e5379\nand six foraging trips over their respective deployment periods.\nDives were defined as bird movements to depths greater than 1 m.\nContinuous wavelet transformation\nWe applied continuous wavelet transformation to take into\naccount the non-stationary oscillation of the acceleration data.\nThe wavelet transform has been described \u2018\u2018\u2026as a \u2018mathematical\nmicroscope\u2019 in which one can observe different parts of the signal\nby just adjusting the focus\u2019\u2019 [29]. By decomposing a time-series\ninto time and periodicity domains, the wavelet analysis can\ndetermine both the dominant modes of variability and how those\nmodes vary in time [17]. A mother wavelet is a small wave that is\nwell-defined in both time and periodicity and has a time-integral of\nzero. The continuous wavelet transform of a signal recorded as\ndiscrete sequence xn is defined as the convolution of xn with a\nscaled and translated version of mother wavelet function y:\nW s, n\u00f0 \u00de~\nXN-1\nn\u2019~0\nxn\u2019y\nn\u2019{n\u00f0 \u00dedt\ns\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u00f01\u00de\nwhere s is a scale, n is the localized time index, dt is the time step of\na sequence, and N is the total number of data points [17]. By\nvarying the wavelet scale s and translating along the localized time\nindex n, a picture showing both the intensity of any feature versus\nthe scale and how this intensity varies with time can be\nconstructed.\nWe analyzed temporal changes in the distribution of amplitude\nat a different scale s using the Morlet mother wavelet function.\nThe Morlet wavelet function is:\ny g\u00f0 \u00de~p{1=4eiv0ge{g2=2 \u00f02\u00de\nwhere v0 is the nondimensional frequency. The Morlet wavelet\nfunction is based on trigonometric principles (Fig. 3A). Therefore\nit can decompose time series data into several sine waves (Fig. 3B)\nand is widely used for the analysis of ecological processes [18\u201320].\nThe nondimentional frequency v0 is the parameter which defines\nthe balance of decomposition resolution between time and\nperiodicity domains. The larger v0 value has higher sensitivity\nin the periodicity domain and lower sensitivity in the time domain.\nThe value v0 = 10 was chosen to best differentiate the time and\nperiodicity domains for the body acceleration of European shags.\nThis mother wavelet consists of approximately seven waves\n(Fig. 3A). The signal was convoluted with this mother wavelet.\nConsequently, the sensitivity for both time and periodicity\ncomponents was highest when the signal made up approximately\nseven waves.\nTo connect the wavelet coefficient W(s, n) to the amplitude of a\nsignal, the formula was defined by:\nA s, n\u00f0 \u00de~\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nW s, n\u00f0 \u00dej j2\nq\ndtCe\ns\n\u00f03\u00de\nwhere Ce is the empirical coefficient (1.06392). We added Ce into\nthe formula to modify the value of A(s, n) equal to the amplitude of\nthe oscillation in xn at the corresponding scale s and the localized\ntime index n (Fig. 3B).\nThe Fourier wavelength (cycle) l corresponding to the scale s is\nexpressed as [17]:\nl~\n4p\nv0z\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2zv20\nq s \u00f04\u00de\nTherefore, this formula can be transformed to:\nA l, n\u00f0 \u00de~\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nW kl, n\u00f0 \u00dej j2\nq\ndtCe\nkl\n\u00f05\u00de\nand\nk~\nv0z\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2zv20\nq\n4p\n\u00f06\u00de\nThe value of A(l, n) corresponds to the amplitude of the\ntrigonometric function component in the signal with the cycle l at\nthe localized time index n. We calculated the average value of A(l,\nn) within each sec by each cycle l to reduce the data size and\nenable further clustering analysis, here termed a \u2018\u2018behavior\nspectrum\u2019\u2019 (Fig. 3B, C, D). A behavior spectrum provides a\nmeasure of the contribution of each periodicity to the signal at a\ndifferent time position by each sec. We calculated the values of a\nbehavior spectrum at 64 time steps of a cycle ranging from 0.05 to\n1 sec as:\nl~Cmin|2\ni log2 Cmax=Cmin\u00f0 \u00de\nT i~1, 2, 3, . . . , 64\u00f0 \u00de \u00f07\u00de\nwhere T is the number of time steps (64 steps), Cmin is the minimum\ncycle (0.05 sec), and Cmax is the maximum cycle (1 sec).\nEach behavior was characterized by a behavior spectrum\nproviding its periodicities and amplitude. The shape of a spectrum\nat each time point was determined by the features of the original\nsignal. Usually, a signal derived from animal movement is not the\nshape of a single trigonometric function, but is made up of a\nFigure 1.

The lowest frequency is called\nthe fundamental frequency and the higher frequencies are called\nharmonics (Fig. 3B). The signal at fundamental frequency was\nregarded as the cycle of body movement [30].\nThe amplitude calculated in this procedure is not directly\nrelated to the intensity of animal dynamic movement. However,\nthe convolution with the Morlet wavelet function decomposes the\nacceleration signal into several sine waves and inversely the sum of\ndecomposed sine waves becomes the same shape as the original\nacceleration within the range of cycles applied in the transforma-\ntion. Therefore similar suits of sine waves in the decomposed data\nmay indicate the same type of movement with slightly different\nperiodicities and intensities [30]. By comparing the signal\namplitudes among similar shapes of the behavior spectrum, the\nrelative intensity of the movement could be assessed within the\nsame type of movement.\nThe \u2018cone of influence\u2019 is a reflection of a consequent loss in the\nwavelet spectrum near the start and end of the time series [17]. To\navoid the cone of influence, we truncated the behavior spectrum at\nthe beginning and end region by 3 times the length of the\nmaximum scale.\nClustering\nWe employed the k-means algorithm to cluster the behavior\nspectra at each sec to generate the ethogram. K-means clustering is\nan unsupervised, interactive algorithm that minimizes the within-\ncluster sum of squared Euclidean distances from the cluster\ncentroids. The algorithm is composed of the following steps [21]:\n1. Place k points randomly in the space represented by the objects\nthat are being clustered. These points represent initial group\ncentroids.\n2. Assign each object to the group that has the closest centroid.\n3. When all objects have been assigned, recalculate the positions\nof the k centroids.\n4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until the centroids no longer move. This\nproduces a separation of the objects into groups from which the\nmetric to be minimized can be calculated.\nBehavior spectra at each time point were composed of cycles of\n64 time steps. In other words, each spectrum was defined by 64\nvalues. Therefore, it was mathematically the same as a point in 64\ndimensions. We performed k-means clustering in the same manner\nas clustering points in 64 dimensions [31].\nAcceleration ethogram\nTo generate the acceleration ethogram, we used data from three\nmale and three female European shags for which data were\navailable for 24 h. Surge acceleration was converted to the\nbehavior spectrum. We assumed 20 behavior elements would be\nadequate to cover all behavior patterns of European shags in the\nbreeding season. The behavior spectra from the six birds were\ncombined and processed by the k-means clustering algorithm to\ndetermine 20 centroids (clusters) in 64 dimensions. These centroids\nrepresented typical spectra of discriminated behaviors. We\nregarded these 20 spectra as an \u2018\u2018acceleration ethogram\u2019\u2019.\nBehavior discrimination by acceleration ethogram\nSurge accelerations from sixteen birds were converted into a\nbehavior spectrum. Each spectrum at each sec was regarded as a\npoint in 64 dimensions, and calculated as squared Euclidean\ndistances between the point and the 20 centroids that corresponded\nto the elements of the acceleration ethogram. The centroid providing\nthe shortest squared Euclidean distance was chosen as the behavior\nelement for the spectrum at each sec.\nBehavior discrimination by water depth\nTo evaluate the accuracy of our procedure we used independent\ninformation on time spent at depth by the sixteen birds, to\nconstruct detailed time budgets for each individual. A typical\nforaging trip for an European shag consists of a flight out from the\nbreeding colony to the feeding site, followed by a series of dives\nwith periods between dives spent on the sea surface, after which\nthe bird returns to the colony [32]. Six behavior phases were\ndefined from the water depth\u2013time series: on land, commuting to\nand from the feeding area, dive descent, the bottom phase of the\ndive, dive ascent, and on the sea surface. Different phases within a\ndive were defined using the rate of change in depth (descent, less\nthan 20.6 m s21; bottom, 20.3 to +0.3 m s21; ascent,\n.1 m s21). Shags typically dive in bouts, and following Watanuki\net al. [33], we used a bout-ending criterion of 340 secs to identify\ndiscrete bouts [34]. The interval between dives within a dive bout\nwas defined as time spent on the sea surface. The durations of\nflights to and from a foraging site in a foraging trip were reported\nto be less than 30 min [32]. Therefore, 30 min before and after a\ndive bout were assumed to be the commuting phase. The\nremaining time was assumed to correspond to the period spent\non land. The compositions of the behavior elements of the\nacceleration ethogram were calculated in each behavior phase\ndefined by the depth profile.\nComputer application\nTo facilitate and perform the procedures in this study, we\ndeveloped a user-friendly application called \u2018\u2018Ethographer\u2019\u2019. The\ncode was written in Igor Pro language under Igor Pro ver. 5\n(WaveMetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR, USA). The application\nworks on an Igor Pro platform, provides a graphical user interface,\nand is easy to master. Ethographer is available, at no charge, for\nacademic use (http:\/\/bre.soc.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp\/bls\/index.php?\nEthographer).\nResults\nThe surge acceleration signals were classified into 20 behavior\ngroups in the acceleration ethogram. Each behavior element in an\nacceleration ethogram was described by the spectrum of an\nacceleration pattern (Fig. 4). The spectra were thought of as the\nethogram derived from surge acceleration. The shapes of several\nelements in an acceleration ethogram seemed to be similar (e.g.\nelements 0, 1, 2; elements 14, 15, 16, 17) (Fig. 4). These elements\nmay represent the same pattern of behavior with different\nperiodicities and intensities of movement. The amplitude at the\ndominant cycle in an ethogram ranged from 0.024 (0.11 sec cycle\nin element 7) to 5.072 (0.13 sec cycle in element 3). In general, a\nbehavior element producing a strong amplitude exhibited a clear\npeak, whereas a spectrum with a weak amplitude tended to be\nflatter in shape. This may mean that a discrete behavior with a\nstrong dynamic movement is composed of periodic motions while\na flat spectrum indicates that the original behavior consists of a less\nperiodic movement.\nFigure 5 shows an example of the application of our procedure.\nIn the behavior spectrum, only a weak signal appears in the first\nsection (Fig. 5D). This is equivalent to a weak signal in surge\nacceleration (Fig. 5C), indicating that the bird was motionless. In\ncontrast, a clear peak is seen in the middle section with an\napproximately 0.18 sec cycle. This corresponds to the periodicity\nAutomated Etho-Analysis\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 April 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 4 | e5379\nin the flight of the shag (5.5 Hz, [23]). In the last section, a weak\nand noisy signal is seen in the spectrum, indicating the existence of\nnon- or weakly-periodical movement with a cycle of more than\n0.3 sec. This could be derived from the bird being in an unstable\nposition, for example because it was on the sea surface. The lower\npanel shows the result of categorization by the k-means clustering\nalgorithm (Fig. 5E). Behaviors were clearly divided into three parts\nas shown in the left, middle and right sections: time on land\n(elements 6 and 7), in flight (element 1), and on the sea surface\n(element 9). Another example is shown in Fig. 6 in which the\nFigure 4. Twenty elements of acceleration ethogram.

These data were consistent with a shag descending using foot\npropulsion at 2\u20135 Hz (0.2\u20130.5 sec cycle), such that the frequency\ndecreased with depth [22]. The spectrum in the bottom phase was\ncharacterized by a noisy signal with obscure peaks in 0.4 and 0.2 sec\ncycles. There was no peak in the spectrum of the ascent phase. Three\nbehaviors (on the sea surface, bottom phase, and dive ascent) were\nwell categorized by k-means clustering: element 9, mainly element\n10, and element 7 respectively. Of particular interest in the k-means\nclustering were the results for dive descent where behavior spectra\nwere categorized into several elements sequentially (elements 13, 14,\n15, 16, 17, and 10). Among the behavior spectra of these elements,\nelement 13 was characterized by several peaks and large amplitude\n(Fig. 4D). Spectrum shapes were similar among elements 14\u201317.\nHowever, the dominant cycles became longer and the amplitudes\nbecame smaller from element 14 to element 17. The dominant cycle\nof element 10 was the longest with the smallest amplitude. The\nsequence of these elements was consistent with known foot-\npropulsion behavior during descent, which changes in periodicity\nand intensity of movement with depth [22]. When visualized over\nthe whole foraging trip, elements 0, 1, and 2, which produced an\napproximately 1.8 sec cycle, were exhibited before and after a dive\nbout, indicating continuous flight (Fig. 7). Elements 14, 15, 16, and\n17 were associated with dive bouts and may have indicated dive\ndescent.\nFigure 5. Flowchart of procedure to generate ethogram (data representing flight).

Several behavior phases were composed of one or two\nbehavior elements: on land (elements 6 and 7), on the sea surface\n(elements 6 and 9), bottom phase (elements 10 and 11), and ascent\n(element 7). Interestingly, the relative proportions of elements 10\nand 11 in the bottom phase of the dive varied considerably among\nindividual birds (Fig. 8). Element 10 was linked to less periodic\nbehavior and element 11 represented 0.3 sec cycle motion (Fig. 4).\nEuropean shags on the Isle of May are known to be benthic\nfeeders and to use two distinct foraging habitats in sandy and rocky\nareas [33]. Their foraging behavior differs markedly between these\nhabitats such that in rocky areas birds typically travel horizontally\nover the seabed while in sandy areas they focus on a particular\nspot during the bottom phase. Currently we do not have sufficient\ninformation to identify the exact behaviors indicated by element\n10 and 11 but individual differences in foraging habitat usage\ncould potentially explain the high level of individual variation. The\ndescent phase contained several elements, which corresponded to\na change in the foot-propulsion cycle and intensity (Fig. 6 and\nFig. 8D). The commuting phase (Fig. 8C) contained the most\nelements 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, and 9. This phase was defined as the time\nbefore and after a dive bout, and had a fixed duration of 30 min,\nand could thus contain not only flight, but also time spent on land\nand on the sea surface. Components of element 7 and element 9 in\nthe commuting phase are likely to derive from land-based and sea\nFigure 6. Flowchart of procedure to generate ethogram (data representing dive).

The unique elements in\nthe commuting phase were elements 0 and 1. The dominant cycle\nof these elements was a 0.18 sec cycle, which is consistent with the\ndominant cycle of flight in European shags.\nIt is worth noting that acceleration signals when birds are on the\nsea surface could potentially vary due to environmental conditions\nsuch as sea state. Although we did not find such variability in our\ndata set, such differences might be recognized as different behavior\nspectrum and thus \u2018sea surface behavior\u2019 could be categorized into\nmore than one acceleration ethogram.\nDiscussion\nWhen our procedure is adopted to generate an ethogram, four\nparameters need adjusting to take account of the characteristics of\nthe species under consideration. The first is the cycle range of body\nacceleration for continuous wavelet transformation. We selected a\ncycle range from 0.05 to 1 second for European shags. This range\ncorresponds mainly to dynamic body acceleration in this species\n[22]. The second parameter is the number of elements generated by\nthe k-means clustering algorithm. The shapes of major spectra in an\nacceleration ethogram obtained as the output of k-means clustering\nbecame stable by increasing the number of behavior elements to 20,\nbut as a consequence, two similar shaped spectra were generated.\nTherefore we set 20 as the number of behavior element to cover all\nbehavior patterns. Because k-means clustering is processed by\nmathematical definition, the clustering result sometimes seems to be\ndifferent from what would be expected. The practical solution would\nbe to set a larger number of elements to apply to the k-means\nalgorithm than is strictly necessary, and then to combine the\nelements that the researcher identifies that represent the same\nbehavior. The third parameter is the v0 value in the Morlet mother\nwavelet function. Owing to the process of continuous wavelet\ntransformation, detection of periodical movement was preferable to\nnon-periodical movement. Adjustment of the v0 parameter would\nchange the sensitivity to time and periodicity in the movements. The\nfourth parameter is the time duration of a behavior spectrum. We\ncalculated the behavior spectrum by averaging the value of A(l, n)\nwithin each sec, assuming enough fine scale sensitivity to describe\neach discrete behavior of the European shag for general purposes.\nThe time duration for averaging should be adjusted by taking the\nminimum duration of each discrete behavior in the species into\nconsideration. The computer application, Ethographer, allows these\nparameter values to be changed.\nThe k-means algorithm assumes the same periodicity with the\nsame amplitude within a behavior element. Therefore, for\ninstance, it is difficult to discriminate precisely between walking\nand running because behavior changes gradually along a\nFigure 7.

The algorithm will generate several elements with\nslightly different periodicities for walking or running (see the\ndescent section in Fig. 6D). In this case, the exact definitions\namong elements may vary between analyses.\nWe were aware of a few constraints caused by computer\nresources, the most important of which was the amount of data\nthat can be applied to a k-means clustering algorithm. In our\nanalysis we used 24-hour blocks of data from six out of 16 shags to\napply to the algorithm. The amount of data used to generate the\nacceleration ethogram from this subsample was ca. 500,000 time\npoints, which was the maximum amount our computer (Intel Core\n2 Duo 6600 CPU, 2 GB RAM) was able to process. Another\nconstraint relates to the k-means clustering algorithm where the\noutput of clustering is not always exactly the same, although the\noutputs estimated from the same data set in different analysis\nsessions are similar. The reason is that k-means clustering does not\nestimate the optimized solution, but rather the approximate\noptimized solution. In terms of the amount of computation, we\nconsidered that estimation of the optimized solution was not\npractical (e.g. hierarchical clustering).\nFigure 8.

However, it was impossible to discriminate\nbetween time spent on land and dive ascent in our approach. We\nused mainly the dynamic acceleration component of the surge to\nproduce the behavior spectrum. Therefore, when an animal was\nmotionless, the spectrum was the same even if its posture differed.\nThe acceleration ethogram produced in this study was the\nbehavior catalogue derived solely using data for surge acceleration\nof the bird\u2019s body. To make a complete ethogram, posture\ninformation obtained from the long periodicity component of body\nacceleration, as well as use of a time-depth recorders and GPS\nloggers, would be required.\nTo date, quantifying the behavior of wild animals that are hard\nto track has been extremely challenging. In the context of\nconservation biology, lack of information about the foraging\necology of an endangered species may hinder the development of\nan effective conservation strategy. Our approach has the potential\nto shed light on hitherto unknown aspects of the lives of such\nanimals. It is noteworthy that our procedure employs an\nunsupervised clustering algorithm opening up the possibility to\nextract novel behavior patterns that researchers have never\nobserved directly. Although the present system does not guarantee\nthe successful generation of an ethogram for other species, our\napproach offers considerable potential to study the behavior of\npoorly known species, especially in the case of the animals living\nfar from human observation.\nSupporting Information\nText S1 Japanese translation of this article.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0005379.s001 (0.48 MB\nPDF)\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank G.
