Study of the transcribed interviews indicated that officers constructed \nnarratives of themselves as being highly aware of hazards presented by other road \nusers and they used a variety of discursive devices to minimise their own culpability \nand attribute risk elsewhere. Rather than maintaining a straightforward \u2018illusion of \ninvulnerability\u2019 they were formulating a \u2018topography of risk\u2019 in which they were \nresponding to hazards presented by suspects or other road users. Their meticulously \ndetailed accounts of the circumstances surrounding accidents serve to place them as \nknowledgeable and impartial participants and create a sense of expertise and \nauthority. Training initiatives could profitably seek to challenge this \u2018topography of \nrisk\u2019 and sense of authority so that drivers more fully appreciate the hazard they may \npresent to themselves and the public. \n \nKeywords: Risk, Hazard perception; Driving behaviour; Police;  \n \nMaking sense of invulnerability at Work - a Qualitative Study of Police Drivers. \n \nIntroduction \n \nRisk, discourse and the study of safety \nMany authors have recently highlighted the importance of psychosocial variables in \nan organisation\u2019s \u2018safety climate\u2019 and a thorough examination of the values, norms \nand expectations of employees has been advocated as the key to understanding what \nsafety at work means (Mearns & Flin, 2001). In the light of this, and in recognition of \nrecent exhortations for occupational, organisational and safety studies to embrace the \ngrowing interest in qualitative research, (Johnson & Cassell, 2001), this paper reports \non an interview study of police drivers. The aim of this study is to identify the reasons \ngiven for accidents by police drivers and examine how they formulate the causal \nscenarios leading up to their accidents and\/or near-misses.  We shall attempt to show \nhow a discursive approach, by virtue of its close attention to the officers\u2019 discourse, \ncan yield some novel, provocative and important suggestions for further research, \ntraining and skill development in the police service, and other occupational contexts \nwhere people routinely deal with hazardous situations. \n \nThe social context of police accidents  \nRoad accidents involving police cars are increasingly plaguing the relationship \nbetween the police and the community and threaten the public\u2019s perception of the \nintegrity of the service. According to a recent report from the UK\u2019s Police Scientific \nDevelopment Branch (PSDB, 1997) the majority of police collisions occur either in \nresponse to an emergency call or in pursuit, with a minority also occurring on patrol \nand during training. The vast majority of police collisions are minor, causing slight \ninjuries and vehicle damage. Whilst police vehicle accident data are difficult to \nobtain, a UK Police Research Group report (Rix, Walker and Brown, 1997) \nhighlighted some of the tragic consequences. Between 1991 and 1995 there were over \n90 fatalities and about 1300 serious injuries caused during the execution of police \nduties. Of the fatalities, 83% were members of the public whilst 17% were amongst \npolice officers themselves, of whom the majority were driving at the time of the \ncollision. Whilst emergency response and pursuit driving are essential components of \npolice work, death and injury to innocent bystanders in the execution of police duties \nare unacceptable especially if officers themselves are directly to blame for the \naccident. Regardless of the driving required for the execution of his or her duty, the \npublic expect that officers will demonstrate the highest standards when discharging \ntheir duty. The UK\u2019s Police Complaints Authority expressed concern, when in mid-\n2001 its chair, Sir Alistair Graham disclosed a record annual number of deaths from \ntraffic pursuits by police in Britain. He described the 25 deaths in the year 2000-01 as \n\u2018totally unacceptable\u2019 (The Times, 11\/7\/2001). He also said \u2018if there is no early \nimprovement I recommend that the Home Office should seriously consider reviewing \nthe law to ensure that police officers can break the road traffic law only if they are \nundertaking pursuits for a serious offence\u2019. The steady rise over the years in the \nnumber of these kinds of accidents then highlights the urgency of finding new ways to \nmake sense of the situation faced by police drivers and to discover ways of enhancing \nsafety. This growing public and political concern was one of the major justifications \nfor performing the present study. \n \n \nPsychological perspectives on road accidents  \nIt has been suggested that 90% of all accidents can be attributed to human error \n(McKenna, 1993). Despite this, drivers blame the weather, the vehicle or road \nconditions but it is not clear to what extent these self-serving biases are apparent \namongst highly trained police officers. Police drivers need to use excessive speed in \nthe execution of their duty and speed is strongly related to accident involvement \n(West et al, 1993) and excessive speed is argued to be the main contributor to road \naccidents (Johnson et al, 1980). Young men are more unrealistically optimistic about \nthe negative consequences of speeding and unsafe driving (McKenna, 1993). The \nmajority of drivers consider themselves to be more competent and safer than average \ndriver, even after a serious accident requiring hospital treatment (Preston & Harris, \n1965; Svenson, 1981; Glendon et al, 1996) but it is not clear to what extent this bias \napplies to police drivers. The consequences of such an illusory sense of personal \ncontrol when driving are likely to be even more catastrophic for police drivers who \nare able to disregard the traffic law and drive at speed to apprehend a suspect or \nrespond to an emergency call. Stressful driving situations such as pursuit or \nemergency response can induce negative attitudes and emotions that impair driving \nperformance by depleting information-processing resources. There are concerns that \nthe increase in police collisions may be partly due to \u2018red mist syndrome\u2019. Red mist is \na lay-term for the narrowing of attention through heightened psychological and \nphysiological arousal in the pursuit of a goal (catching the suspect) during which \nofficers may take undue risks. For example, Barton et al. (2000) found significant \neffects of high speed driving on police officers\u2019 physiological arousal, emotion and \nwillingness to shoot a target. In this study, officers misattributed their feelings of \narousal caused by the high speed driving to the suspect and are therefore more likely \nto discharge their weapon. \n \nIt is not surprising that drivers who drive for a living are at greater risk of an accident \n(Maycock, 1997). Traffic police may have more driving experience and training \ncompared to standard police drivers but passing a skill-based police driving course is \nno guarantee that the skill will be exhibited and used appropriately during police \ndriving. Racing drivers are highly skilled, but have worse on-the-road driving records \nthan non-racing drivers (Williams and O\u2019Neill, 1974). Whilst skill is important for \nsafe driving, whether it is exhibited or not may depend on other factors, such as \ntendencies toward sensation seeking (Jonah et al, 2001) as well as demographic \nfactors, traffic conditions (Li & Kim, 2000) and even the kinds of driving manoeuvre \nwhich are being undertaken, some of which are more likely to result in accidents \n(Clarke and Ward, 1999). \n \nIn addition to the factors which are susceptible to quantitative investigation, it is \nimportant to note that accidents take place and are investigated within a complex \npsycho-social matrix. Driving and handling risk on the road requires a range of high \nlevel, conscious cognitive skills as well as performance-based skills in manoeuvring \nthe car. In addition, the stories told by officers who have been involved in accidents \nwill be revised and re-told as the incident is investigated, with consequent changes in \nstory structure, emphasis and even arguably the putative underlying memory traces. \nTherefore an investigation of the way professional drivers account for the incidents in \nwhich they are involved is long overdue and in this investigation we will begin this \nprocess.  \n In the light of the foregoing concerns it was felt to be particularly important to \naddress the psychosocial context of police accident involvement considering the \ndearth of literature on the subject.  Psychosocial factors in police accidents are \nespecially important given the stressful nature of police driving and police work.  \nPrevious research on a professional driver group showed a relationship between a \ndrivers vulnerability to stress at work and a likelihood of their being involved in \naccidents (Evans et al, 1987) and that the social work environment and the \nmanagement style of an organisation may also contribute to stress and reduced safety  \n(Kompier and Martino, 1995).  Therefore it is essential to examine these issues in \naccounting for police accidents. \n \nPerceived invulnerability and self-serving biases  \nMost people underestimate their chances of meeting with accidents, illnesses or other \nmisfortunes. Participants in a variety of studies dealing with hazards ranging from \ntraffic to health are apt to overestimate their abilities to avoid problems (Weinstein, \n1980). In group situations, group members will claim a great deal of credit for the \ngroup\u2019s achievements themselves and underestimate the contribution of other \nmembers (Ross and Sicoly, 1979). The sense of having better than average chances, \nabilities or personal qualities can be extremely robust. Snyder (1997) reported that his \nparticipants overestimated their life expectancy by nine years compared with actuarial \ndata, even if they are made aware of this error. This attribution bias is pervasive. \nTraining programmes have attempted to improve safety by enhancing awareness of \nhazards and possible performance impairments (Greenfield and Rogers, 1999). \n \nThe belief that one is relatively invulnerable and can avoid the hazards which beset \none\u2019s peers is argued to have important psychological benefits. Janoff-Bulman (1998) \nargues that the \u2018assumption of meaningfulness and a non-random world enables us to \nfeel safe and secure\u2019 (p. 99). Ironically, this sense of security may increase the risk of \nadverse events if it leads to a decrease in precautionary behaviour.  \n \nThe related issue of perceived control has also played a major part in studies of risk-\ntaking, where people appear more comfortable if they have a sense of control over \nevents. This can lead to acceptance of a higher level of risk even if it is imaginary. \nHorswill and McKenna (1999) showed participants a video simulation of a drive \nthrough a variety of traffic situations. Those who had been asked to imagine that they \nwere driving tended to prefer higher speeds than those who were asked to imagine \nthat they were the passenger.  \n \nIn this paper therefore we will critically discuss the notion of perceived \ninvulnerability by means of a qualitative investigation of police drivers, develop the \nimplications of our findings to reconceptualise notions of risk taking in psychology \nand offer some suggestions for research and development in driver training which \nmight enhance road safety. \n \nAlternative perspectives - shifting the paradigm  \nThere have been a number of calls for a reconceptualisation of the issues involved in \npsychological aspects of accidents and hazards. For example, Hirschhorn and Young \n(1993) advocated the study of organisational cultures and the scrutiny of narratives of \ngood and bad protagonists in the organisation as a way of examining the \u2018defence \nmechanisms\u2019 that organisational subcultures use to contain anxieties concerning risk. \nGoldberg (2000) chides researchers for focusing on perceived invulnerability and \nadvocates a focus on the perceived benefits of risky behaviour. Joffe (1999) suggests \nthat research has focused largely on cognitive information processing aspects and \nneglected emotional aspects. Good et al (2000) promote a focus on the fearlessness \nand invulnerability which is a part of the masculine sex role in Western societies. All \nthese lines of inquiry are prompted by the desire to challenge, revise or extend the \nconcept of perceived invulnerability. Turning to the accounts of participants who are \nengaged in hazardous practices themselves might help to focus our search for \ntheoretical development in this area. \n \nTraditionally, the study of risks, hazards and accidents has assumed that there is a \nrelationship between the individual\u2019s perception of invulnerability and their \npropensity for risk taking, leading to higher rates of accident involvement. In this \nview, risk-takers are unaware of the hazard, are not knowledgeable about precautions, \nor are not mindful of the consequences (Clarke & Ward, 1999; D\u2019Amico & Fromme, \n2000). Consequently, from the very inception of driver education (Personnel Research \nFoundation, 1938) efforts at reducing hazardous behaviour have addressed these \nissues. \n \nWe intend to begin the process of making sense of driving hazards, accidents and near \nmisses by critically interrogating some of the assumptions, theories and findings in \nthe literature on safety, accidents and human error, using the interview material from \npolice officers. This will offer a contrast to much of the literature on accidents, road \nsafety and risk where the majority of research is quantitative in nature, and has \nfocused on demographic or psychometric correlates of accident involvement. The \nomission of participants\u2019 accounts of accidents and their likelihood is unfortunate \nbecause this might lead to some radically different theoretical formulations of \naccidents and suggest new avenues of investigation, education and policy. Attention \nto these accounts is also important because they often form the basis of any further \ninvestigation of accidents, whether by academic researchers or in the form of \ninquiries undertaken by statutory bodies. Even physical evidence such as skid marks \nand impact traces is often interpreted in the light of participants\u2019 accounts of how they \noccurred. The pervasiveness of personal accounts is inescapable and the present paper \nwas conceived in an attempt to establish some of their discursive features and to \nattempt to discern the implications of these for theoretical accounts of accidents.  \n \nMethod \nThis investigation is based on a corpus of material derived from a group of 54 officers \nwho were interviewed as part of a larger study of police driving. They were employed \nby two large urban police service and were recruited via newsletter, website and \ndirect contact. All had agreed to participate in an interview as part of the research. \nThe average age was 37 and had held a full driving licence on average for 18 years. \nDuring the previous three years, 27 had been involved in a blameworthy collision, 11 \nhad been involved in a non-blameworthy collision and 16 had been accident-free. \nThirty nine had received advanced police driver training and 14 were trained to a \nstandard level.  \n \nThe interviews were originally intended to elicit accounts of accidents and near \nmisses, views on the suitability and appropriateness of training and the possibility that \norganisational factors such as target response times and understaffing might \ncontribute to accidents. In addition we inquired about the possibility that drivers \nmight be overly emotional when involved in pursuits and emergency responses and \nsuffer so called \u2018red mist syndrome\u2019. In order to enable officers to freely express their \nopinions during the interview they were assured of anonymity and confidentiality, and \nefforts were made to ensure that this was maintained throughout the investigation. For \nexample, details were removed from the data that might identify individual officers. \nConfidentiality was particularly important in this study because of the officers\u2019 \napprehension that accounts of accidents and comments about the organisation might \nresult in repercussions for them. Advantageously, the researchers were not members \nof the police services concerned and could readily assure participants of their \nindependence. \n \nAnalysis strategies were prompted by several concerns. First, whether theories of \naccident causation involving a putative sense of invulnerability were sustained by the \ndata. Second, we were concerned to follow the lead of grounded theory methods \nwhere it is argued that theoretical formulations should be allowed to arise from the \ndata itself in a bottom up manner (Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Strauss & Corbin, 1998). \nThus, an initial intuition that the study of accounts of accidents could shed light on \nwhat the participants were expressing was extended into a close reading to extract \nthemes relating to the management and self-government of what they saw to be risks \nand hazards. The strength of the grounded theory approach is illustrated by the way \nthat existing theoretical presuppositions about the subjective sense of invulnerability \nand risk taking were challenged by the data. The second strand of our analytic \nstrategy was to follow the lead of Potter and Edwards (e.g. Edwards & Potter, 1992; \nPotter, 2000; Potter & Wetherell, 1987) who argue that language - such as that in \nwhich people talk about accidents, near misses and the like - is a form of social \naction. Rather than merely describing the state of the world, language is a transaction \nin which the actors try to perform some social business. Thus, participants\u2019 \nformulations of accident involvement might facilitate courses of action - for example, \nthey might delimit culpability, secure the speaker's status or assign blame elsewhere. \nIn doing this we were attentive to the kinds of resources of meaning speakers draw \nupon, the words they choose to express and formulate events and the way they \nmanaged their \u2018stake\u2019 in the events so as to appear less blameworthy. A third source \nof inspiration is ethnomethodology (Sacks, 1992, Forrester & Ramsden, 2000). \nAccordingly, we will place centre-stage the participants\u2019 accounts of what they were \ndoing and take these as our starting point for interpretation and attempts to theorise. It \nis not our concern to determine whether the accounts presented here are literally true. \nRather, we are interested in elucidating their formulation of the events and the risks \ninvolved and considering the implications for psychological theories of accident \ncausation. In this way we hope to develop new tools to obtain some purchase on an \narea of human experience which is very difficult to study because of its extremely \ntransient nature. The thematic structure of the presentation of results is based on the \nbroad themes that emerged in the participant's discussion of the issues - as grounded \ntheorists would advocate - and own-words quotations are used extensively so as to \nallow an appreciation of how respondents expressed their views. \n \nResults and discussion \nThe results section is divided into two main sections. First, we shall present a broad \noverview of participants\u2019 responses to the interview questions and go on to consider \nin a more detailed fashion the structure of their accounts of accidents and near misses. \nOverview of responses to interview questions  \nInterviewer: When was the last time you received any driver training? \nThe time elapsed since officers had last received any driver training varied from less \nthan one year to over 25 years. On average it was approximately five years since they \nlast attended a driver training course (mean = 5.50, SD = 5.39). \nInterviewer: What was the main noticeable improvement in your driving after the \ncourse? \nAs a result of training, more than half of those interviewed believed that they had \nimproved their control of the car, reaction time, confidence and driving tactics. About \n39% saw an improvement in hazard awareness and a fifth saw an improvement in \ndriving safety. A somewhat smaller group believed that they drove more cautiously \nand slowly as a result of driver training. \nInterviewer: In what way could any of the police driver training courses you\u2019ve \nbeen on be improved? \nApproximately 44% of those questioned believed that there should be no driving test \nduring training, suggesting that officers should be assessed as they go along. Forty \none percent believed that the police driver training courses should be longer, \nsuggesting that there is insufficient time to cover all the skills necessary on the \ncourses they have attended. Nearly 28% felt that there was a need for more specific \ndriver training such as night-time driving, skid pad training and driving in unfamiliar \nsettings. More than 22% believed there should be more response and pursuit driver \ntraining available.  \nInterviewer: Do you think you would benefit from any further training? \nA large majority (89%) felt that they would benefit from further training. \nInterviewer: Do you think that some police drivers you know would benefit from \nfurther training? \nMore than half confirmed that drivers they know would benefit from further training \nbecause they are inexperienced and\/or lack sufficient training. Respondents suggested \nthat these officers needed reassessments. Almost 28% of the sample knew someone \nwho drove dangerously. A further 28% mentioned that some of their colleagues broke \nthe rules on \u2018blues and twos\u2019, were complacent, or forgot their training once they \nwere back on the job. \nInterviewer: Do you think some police officers are naturally good drivers?  \nLess than a quarter of the participants believed there was such a thing as a naturally \ngood driver, implying that most believed that driving was a learned skill. Of this small \nnumber, more than 70% felt that good drivers have naturally well co-ordinated \ndriving skills and react accordingly. About 29% felt that naturally good drivers were \nsafe at high speeds and had a calm personality. Nearly a quarter believed that attitude, \nconfidence, and general enjoyment of driving was a factor. \nInterviewer: Have you ever terminated a pursuit because it was too dangerous to \ncontinue? \nWhilst many officers may not have been involved in situations that required them to \npursue a vehicle, of those sampled, a fifth had terminated a pursuit because of the \nrisks involved. \nInterviewer: What do you think are the special qualities a good police driver needs? \nOfficers mentioned several factors that were necessary for good police driving. More \nthan 52% believed awareness and appreciation of danger were important and a further \n52% mentioned attitude, confidence, maturity and common sense. Half of the officers \nsampled felt that patience, restraint and calmness were important. Almost 46% of the \nresponses also suggested that driving skills such as quick responses, strategic driving \nand good driving judgement were special qualities for police driving. Here, officers \nappear to have a good understanding of the sorts of skills that are essential for safe \ndriving.  \nInterviewer: To what extent are collisions due to factors within the organisation? \nThe majority of the participants (41%) believed that workforce problems (such as \nworkforce shortages or people doing the wrong job) were partly responsible for police \ncollisions. Over 39% of the sample suggested those stress-related problems such as \nfatigue and job demands were organisational factors contributing to the number of \npolice collisions. This supports the inclusion of cognitive skills training to change \nmaladaptive driving appraisal and coping strategies within police driver training. \nOver a third of those sampled mentioned the problem of response time targets leading \nto some officers taking unnecessary risks in order to reduce response times. Nearly \n24% suggested collisions were the result of lack of training and 20% said some of the \npolice vehicles are not suitable for the job they are required to do. \nInterviewer: On a scale of one to ten what are the chances of you having a \nblameworthy collision in the next 12 months? \nThis item is a measure of officer\u2019s perception of risk. As we have noted, risk \nperception has been linked to risk-taking behaviour, and may also influence driving \nperformance and psychometric test scores. Responses to this question ranged from \nzero (seven officers believed they had no chance of being involved in a blameworthy \ncollision) through to seven (suggesting a belief that an at-fault accident is almost \ninevitable). However, the mean was relatively low at 2.18 (SD = 1.80). \nInterviewer: On a scale of one to ten what are the chances of you having a non-\nblameworthy collision in the next 12 months? \nRisk perception was somewhat elevated for non-blameworthy collisions as officers \nwere prepared to accept that there might be an increased risk of being involved in a \ncollision that was not their fault. The mean score here was almost double that of the \nmean for a blameworthy collision (3.54, SD = 2.40 compared with 2.18) showing a \nlarge discrepancy between judgements of risk for blameworthy and non-blameworthy \ncollisions. Therefore, officers generally believed themselves to be at a low risk of \nbeing involved in a blameworthy collision, thus apparently demonstrating an illusory \nsense of their own personal control whilst driving. \n \nAccounting for accidents: Reformulating invulnerability \nA closer scrutiny of the accounts of drivers will now be presented, especially where \nthis involves their accounts of accidents and near misses. This qualitative analysis \nwill allow us to cast some new and critical light on the idea of invulnerability. \n \nMuch of the literature we reviewed earlier led us to expect that a traditional ignorance \nof hazard, underestimation of risk and blaming other people would appear prominent \nin the accounts. Indeed, for some informants this was true, but we detected much \ncounterintuitive evidence that other accident-accounting strategies prevailed, as we \nshall illustrate. \n \nThe excess of awareness: Detail as a resource for rationality \nOne of our concerns, borrowed from discursive psychology is the way in which \nparticipants manage the issues of stake and interest in their accounts of events. That \nis, this perspective assumes that accounts are not merely reflections of events but are \ncarefully constructed so as to present the protagonist in a favourable light and to \ndeflect possible criticisms. At the same time, the protagonists will sometimes go to \ngreat pains to display their neutrality and try to convince the hearers that they do not \nhave an axe to grind (Potter, 1996). \n \nThe motivation to select amongst possible formulations and construct versions of \nevents in a favourable manner might be especially acute amongst those who have had \nan accident. Choice of language and styles of formulation might have important \nconsequences for the narrator who might face sanctions both within the organisation \nand more broadly within the judicial system. \n \nThus, a great many of the accounts of accidents which participants had been involved \nin were presented in terms of an excess of awareness and a surfeit of rationality. As if \nattempting to deflect an implication that they might have acted hastily or rashly, the \nofficers were apt to provide elaborate justifications in their accounts (Scott & Lyman, \n1968; Harre & Secord, 1974).  \n \nThe benefits of risk and the sense of urgency  \n(Officer 1): \u201cI had an accident, which was only a small accident, but in hindsight, \nbecause I tried to do something to save somebody\u2019s life but yet the bloke survived but \nI had an accident as a result of it.\u201d \nThus, in this formulation, it is not a risk blindly taken but one which results from a \ncareful consideration of the relative benefits of different courses of action. Students of \nmoral development might note an uncanny resemblance between this account and \nKohlberg\u2019s \u2018Heinz and the druggist\u2019 moral dilemma (Kohlberg, 1972). The \u2018small\u2019 \naccident is contrasted with the presumably moral and practical benefit of saving a life. \nThis formulation of accidents as being relatively insignificant is not accomplished as \na result of feelings if invulnerability in any simple sense but is achieved by carefully \ncounterposing the significant elements in the story. This can be seen in more detail; as \nthe officer describes the incident in more detail.  \nInterviewer: Please describe what happened. \nOfficer 1: \u201cAn old man got knocked down at a zebra crossing. The ambulance \ncouldn\u2019t keep him alive because he was dead they said the helicopter was going to \nland on the junction. I went over and they said \u2018oh no they can\u2019t land there because of \nthe wires, they are going to land down the road but we need the crew here as quick as \npossible. As is normal I drove up the road, the north back traffic was all stationary it \nwas solid I drove south on the road to the school where they had landed. The \nhelicopter medical crew ran out and jumped in the car. I'm now in the position where \nI\u2019m two hundred yards from the old boy behind me, and two hundred yards to the \nnext junction to turn around in a narrow street which is reduced by half its length and \nhalf its width by a queue. The choice is to drive down to the next junction turn at the \njunction and drive back up again or reverse, I decided to reverse. I reversed in a \nstraight line I had plenty of vision, thirty miles an hour in reverse, then as I \napproached the front of the queue of stationary traffic there is a PC is standing there. I \nsounded the horn three times, with that the police officer stopped the traffic that was \ncoming up the side turning. I mistakenly believed that he had stopped the traffic in \norder to let me past, to get to the accident. What had happened, he had been told to \nstop the traffic to let the buses go the wrong side, passing the accident. He had already \nspoken to the bus driver, so when he stopped the traffic, unaware of my presence \nbecause the siren did not work, I was mistakenly believed that he had stopped the \ntraffic because he has heard the horn to let me go the bus driver has not bothered \nlooking. I have slowed down as I\u2019ve crept past the bus, as I have crept past the bus the \nbus has pulled out and hit the side of the car. I carried up another thirty yards, \ndropped the medical crew off, and came back to assess the accident. Most people \nwould normally give you two points for that but there is a certain politics at work that \nresulted in a suspension.\u201d \n \nThere are a number of important issues in this quote for an understanding of \nvulnerability and invulnerability. First, in common with many accounts of accidents \nin our corpus of data, note the richness of the narrative. He outlines in meticulous \ndetail the circumstances leading up to the accident, and that his whole sequence of \nmanoeuvres were occasioned by people and conditions other than himself, the wires \nover the road junction, the decision of the helicopter pilot to land elsewhere, the \ntraffic conditions, even his colleague stopping vehicles emerging from a side road. \nThe account of the accident is formulated so as to make it seem to have occurred not \nas a result of a blatant disregard of risk, but as a misunderstanding - thinking a \ncolleague was stopping the traffic for him, but was in fact stopping it so as to allow a \nbus to proceed. Thus a process of decision making which is foregrounded in the \naccount the possible hazard of reversing at speed is \u2018neutralised\u2019 (Matza 1967). He \ntravels at \u2018thirty miles an hour\u2019 - not in excess of the typical UK speed limit in urban \nareas - and has \u2018plenty of vision\u2019 (despite there being a medical crew in the car). \nIndeed, he has an almost telepathic - albeit post hoc - awareness of the state of mind \nof other parties: his colleague was \u2018unaware\u2019 and the bus driver has \u2018not bothered \nlooking\u2019 - an implied carelessness which helps to prepare the scene for subsequent \nevents - the bus driver \u2018pulled out and hit the side of the car\u2019. The lexical choices too \nare part and parcel of this formulation. The bus driver \u2018hit\u2019 the \u2018side\u2019 of the narrator\u2019s \ncar. Moreover, as he puts it twice, he \u2019crept\u2019 (rather than \u2019reversed\u2019 or \u2018drove\u2019) past \n(rather than \u2018into\u2019) the bus. In a sense then, we can hear how he is heading off \npossible alternative formulations of the same events which might emphasise that the \nprotagonist had reversed at speed into an oncoming bus. To reiterate, we are not \nseeking to assess whether we agree with the truth of his account as a description of \nevents. What we are attempting to show is how he constructs a sense of the truth in \nsitu, which emphasises his own rationality and safety and the punishment as an \noverreaction. The distance he covered after the collision was a mere \u2018thirty yards\u2019 and \nnot, for example the kind of distance that would count as a \u2018failure to stop after an \naccident\u2019.  \n \nHere the excess of awareness and the meticulous detail of the participants account is \nalso a resource on which the teller of tales of accidents can draw as a means of \nmaking the account convincing to hearers. This has also been demonstrated more \nexperimentally in the study of eyewitness testimony (Bell & Loftus, 1988; 1989). \nWithin the study of storytelling about unusual or hard-to-believe events it has been \nnoted that detail is deployed as a means of authenticating the speaker\u2019s account \n(Wooffitt, 1992). Empirical research on memory for events in the street as people go \nabout their daily business typically shows very low rates of recall, and theories such \nas \u2018urban overload\u2019 enjoyed a brief vogue in the 1970s to account for this (Milgram, \n1970). The key feature here is the way memory - detailed, authoritative and \n(apparently) impartial - is usable by the participants as a resource to construct their \naccounts. This recollects Edwards\u2019s (1997) thesis that what might appear to be \ncognitive entities - memories, scripts, attributions and so on - do not simply underlie \ndiscourse and propel it (as with classic cognitive psychology), but are participants\u2019 \ncategories. They are used in discourse to accomplish such things as descriptions, \nclaims, accusations, and accounts of error. A memory such as this is the warrantable \noutcome of interpretative work by the participants in interaction.  \n \nThe deployment of apparently detailed, detached and authoritative memories in \naccounts of accidents was a feature of most other narratives of accidents in the corpus \nof data, as we shall show below. \n \nAccounting for accidents - the dialectic of disinterest and justification \nThe interactional and professional problem faced by officers who have had accidents \nis to minimise their own culpability and to account for their actions so they seem \ncareful, safe, reasonable, and warranted by the circumstances despite their having \nended up crashing. To examine how the disinterested style of narration might help \nthem accomplish self serving interactional ends, let us consider two more extracts \nbefore offering a more extended commentary on the issue. \nInterviewer: How many blameworthy collisions have you had? \nOfficer 2: \u201cOne about four months ago. I was pulling up outside the police station, it \nwas very busy and there was a queue of traffic. I noticed a woman overtaking on the \nwrong side of the road and she was going against the traffic. She was driving with her \nleft hand on the steering wheel and holding the phone in her right. She has then gone \nup to the junction to turn right causing a car coming across the junction to slam on its \nbrakes. I went to pursue her and I didn\u2019t have time to turn on my blues and twos, as I \nturned the corner I was coming into the junction, I was conscious of avoiding the cars \non my left and smashed wing mirrors with a transit van coming on my right.\u201d \n \nThe accident described by Officer 2, in common with many others, is nested in a \ndetailed account of conditions which had a bearing on the events. There are some \ndetailed descriptions of traffic conditions and the lexical choices themselves convey a \nsense of how the accident had occurred. A \u2018transit van\u2019 might be wider than a private \ncar and the term might allude to stereotypes in the UK of \u2018white van man\u2019. Thus, \nthere is a meticulously crafted quality to the reality which is constructed around the \naccident, where a variety of devices are used to construct the physical features of the \nscene and the narrator as a person who was aware and in control of the situation. \nDespite the regrettable events, the overwhelming impression of rationality and \nawareness of other road users prevailed. Indeed, this contrasts with the apparent \ndisregard of safety in his description of the target, driving on the wrong side of the \nroad whilst telephoning and forcing other motorists to take evasive action. Again, \nrather than a simple description connoting a sense of invulnerability, this officer has \ncrafted an account which emphasises both a meticulous awareness of risk and a \njustification for his actions in terms of the hazards being presented by the other \nmotorist. Her disregard for safety is almost confirmed by the officer having an \naccident - despite his hyperalertness and his eschewing distractions like turning on his \nlights and sirens - so the target\u2019s behaviour is made to seem even more irresponsible.  \nA similar impression is given in this second example: \nInterviewer: How many blameworthy collisions have you had? \nOfficer 3: One last September, driving down the country lanes in the early hours of \nthe morning. One of my colleagues was in a pursuit and I was basically playing catch-\nup.  I was going through the lanes that I didn\u2019t know very well, and I could see the \nlights of the other cars in the distance ahead of me. The road was dry but I was \napproaching a bend that had a lot of tree cover, which I believe, kept the road \nunderneath wet, I braked very hard. To this day I can\u2019t, the vehicle has ABS, but I \ncan\u2019t remember the ABS cutting in. All I remember is the wheels locking ahead of me \nand going straight in to the bank and damaged the underneath of the vehicle. \n \nHere again there is a demonstration of awareness of the conditions and the \ncapabilities of the vehicle and how they might affect the handling in that situation. \nThe formulation of his inferential framework - that the tree cover might keep the road \nunderneath wet (rather than keeping it dry), and that the ABS may not have acted - \nnot only minimise culpability but also demonstrate awareness. Seeing the lights ahead \nof him implies that he was not going much faster than the cars ahead, which had \npresumably successfully negotiated the road shortly before the protagonist himself. \nIndeed, his accident is almost a vindication of the view that the vehicles in front were \ntaking some severe risks in travelling so fast. \n \nWhen police officers have accidents there will be many opportunities to rehearse and \nreproduce their accounts, as the events surrounding the accident are investigated. \nIndeed, they may try to produce an account which minimises their culpability and \nestablishes them as competent drivers to avoid negative consequences like points on \nthe police driving licence (\u2018if you get ten then you are banned.\u2019 - Officer 4) or \nprosecution. Unlike the accident investigator, our interest here is not in the literal \ntruth of these accounts. We are in no position to judge the closeness of the transit van, \nthe wetness of the road, much less the consciousness of the drivers in the moments \nbefore an accident. Rather, our interest is in how these kinds of accounts of accidents \nare constructed and the implications of this for the discursive structure within which \nthe officers are embedded, for we would argue that the minutiae and detail of the \naccounts is itself conditioned by the narrative context of the events. The officers are \nkeen to convince listeners that they were acting to the highest standard of awareness \neven when the accident occurred and were not only aware of the immediate road \nconditions but were actively making inferences about the likely risks they were \nencountering. These accidents are unfortunate but still within the realm of what was \norderly, conscious and rational. The use of technical detail may be a strategy of \nlegitimation (Seguin, 2001). Thus, the regime of training, inquiries, accountability \nand public policy informs officers\u2019 narratives - and arguably their consciousness - in \ninculcating this strategy for storytelling. As Schmid and Fielder (1999, p. 808) argue, \n\u2018causal knowledge is built into language as a system\u2019 and officers are adept at \ndeploying these causal implications in their storytelling accomplishments.  \n \nFrom the point of view of the theories and findings in the introduction, we can see \nsome of the discursive mechanics which lie behind the \u2018false uniqueness\u2019 effect or the \n\u2018illusion of invulnerability\u2019. Rather than an unthinking ignorance of risk, participants \nare constructing a complex topography of risk where they are a low risk point. Other \npeople, road conditions or even the cars themselves are the source of problems \nwhereas officers depict themselves hard at work managing them and are thus unlikely \nto construct themselves as being the hazard. \n \nThe detail of their accounts, rather than being a simple reflection of memory, is also a \nresource participants are able to deploy in making their accounts convincing - a \ntechnique which is important in factual discourse (Wooffitt, 1992; Potter 1996). In \naddition, eyewitness testimony research indicates that detailed accounts are more \nbelievable than those where details are sparse (Bell and Loftus, 1988; 1989).  \n \nEasthope (1986) argues that this 'clear and transparent style' (which can be seen in the \nofficers\u2019 accounts) was developed in the period surrounding the English Civil War by \nwriters determined to argue clearly about religious and political issues. It purports to \nbe '. . .styleless, a clear window on reality that presents the truth nakedly and \nobjectively as it is without any subjective feeling or attitude getting in the way' (1986, \np 79). This mode of writing, in professional contexts and in social science is pre-\neminently about someone else, someone 'other' than the author (Brown et al, 1996; \nGunnarson et al, 1997). Thus, this adds to the impression that the causal agents of \nhazard are other people and their ill-thought and myopic actions whereas the officers\u2019 \ntraffic awareness and impartiality is part of their identity as low risk points in the \nurban landscape. \n \nOfficers as active managers of risk: hanging back and easing off. \nMany of the officers presented themselves as active managers of risk and described \nthemselves undertaking elaborate sequences of judgement recollecting Adam Smith\u2019s \n\u2018rational economic man\u2019 about risks and likely benefits of driving fast to emergencies \nor to pursue suspects.  \n \nOfficer 5:  . . . I sort of made a mental decision after that [accident] that, although I've \nbeen involved in pursuits since I have and I have had damage to the vehicle but that \nwasn\u2019t my fault. But I make the decision that I was always going to try and consider, \nwhat I was got back to earlier on, I\u2019m gonna get there but I\u2019ll get there thirty seconds \nlater which is not gonna make that much difference and I\u2019m gonna get there in one \npiece. But I think I I don\u2019t suppose you get many people that would admit to red mist. \n \nThe sense of risk or hazard management is depicted as extending even further back, \nbefore the decision to respond. However, deciding not to race to an incident might \nplace the officer at odds with colleagues: \nInterviewer: To what extent are collisions due to factors within the organisation? \nOfficer 6: Yes a lot I think because of pressures on controlling staff, a lot of the \ncontrolling staff are civilians not police officers, there are a couple of police officers. \nIf there are any immediate response calls out standing they start screaming down the \nradio about it. \u2018We haven\u2019t got any one to go to this call\u2019, it\u2019s main channel, the \npeople in the controlling room get too over emotional about it, \u2018there\u2019s a fight, and \nhe\u2019s got a knife\u2019. My view is I don\u2019t care, whatever the job is, if doing it is about \nresponse time it does not interest me at all. I have actually called up and downgraded \nthe call. I\u2019ve actually pulled up and said \u2018I'm not going on a response because I'm not \ngoing into that load of old rubbish, it\u2019s not worth it, I'm telling you, I don\u2019t care what \nyou think\u2019.  \nInterviewer: You feel like you are in a position to judge it better yourself? \nOfficer 6: Yes I am, its down to the driver, yes I am but a lot of people don\u2019t they just \nwait for some rubbish call. They say [name] will do it but it\u2019s not worth it, most \nalarms, you know if you should go to an alarm on an immediate call. When do you \nactually catch a burglar because of an alarm, not many, you do sometimes, it\u2019s just \nknowing, a lot of its local knowledge. \n \nHere, the participant elaborates a complex rationale for not speeding and ends by \ndowngrading the element of speed in successful policing. Local knowledge is more \nimportant. Thus his description of his working style is of someone who takes his time, \nignores the urgency expressed by control room staff, and relies not on an instant \nresponse but on local knowledge. Thus, despite his maverick approach when it comes \nto organisational efficiency criteria, he is able to show himself retaining fidelity to the \npurpose of policing.  \n \nThe participants presented themselves as active managers of risk whilst driving too: \nOfficer 7: [I] had to take the junction roundabout on the wrong side because there was \na build up of traffic. I was aware there was a blind spot where people come straight \nonto zebra crossing I was doing the minimal minimal speed. Someone ran across from \nthat blind spot right in front of me even though the lights and sirens were going. But \nbecause I was going slow and aware of the hazard I was able to stop in time and \nsafely. \nOr, alternatively:  \nInterviewer:  Please describe the last \u2018near miss\u2019 when driving on duty \nOfficer 8: To be honest I can\u2019t think of one, you have situations were members of the \npublic do things that are out of the ordinary. But to be honest because you\u2019ve seen \nthem, you\u2019re waiting to see what they are going to do, I wouldn\u2019t really class that as a \nnear miss. Because we would just stop and let them get on with what they are going to \ndo. That\u2019s the majority of it the unpredictability of the general public. What we do is \nwe try to get eye contact with the driver, because if you have eye contact with them \nthen they have normally seen you and you can drive through that hazard without the \nfear that they will come out. They might still come out but you would be going at a \nspeed where you can avoid it, you can stop. But no I can\u2019t think of a near miss \nbecause you always drive to react to what\u2019s coming along anyway. \n \nAs well as presenting the protagonists as actively managing risks these two extracts \nhave a further feature in common. That is, the public are seen as unpredictable, who \ndon\u2019t see the police car or who chance crossing the road or pulling out in front of it. \nHere, the participants are working with categories of people - themselves versus the \n\u2018general public\u2019. They are mobilising \u2018locally used, invoked and organised \nmembership categories\u2019 (Hester, 1997) and this enables them to call upon what is \nconventionally known about police and the public. This enables speakers to draw \nupon larger scale historically embedded discursive formations where the police might \nbe identified, for example, as sources of expertise in road safety. These grander \nresources of meaning and order interpenetrate the interview interaction (Forrester & \nRamsden, 2000; Hutchby, 1996). The police then are able to render an account of \nthemselves where they have special skills of hazard anticipation which not only set \nthem apart from the \u2018general public\u2019 but also allow them to safeguard the public\u2019s \nwell-being, despite the public\u2019s myopia for risk. This formulation neatly inverts the \nusual implication that speeding drivers are hazardous and activates instead the \nimplication that the public themselves are the obstacles and the police are struggling \nheroically to avoid them. \n \nThus, the police are managers of the risks which are set in front of them by other \npeople. Here it is worth returning to the idea of perceived invulnerability described \nearlier. The officers quoted above indicate not so much a straightforward sense of \ninvulnerability - for they are quick to show awareness of hazards presented in fast \ndriving - but a sense that they are members of a privileged category who deal capably \nwith hazards presented by other people but do not themselves constitute a hazard to \nothers. Thus, there is a sense of special status to the membership category they \nconstruct themselves into. \n \nThe sense of a rational approach to hazards is further enhanced by the elaborate \ndiscourse on road conditions and other drivers\u2019 behaviour which is present in these \naccounts. The officers then are in a privileged category characterised by rationality. \n \nThe construction of rationality and the control of emotions \nThe rationality that was espoused by the officers was not something that existed \nnaturally. When the concept was unpacked, it was described a being the result of a \nmeticulous process of organizing and controlling one\u2019s self and one\u2019s feelings. \nInterviewer: What do you think are the special qualities a good police driver needs? \nOfficer 4: To control adrenaline, that effects for me personally pursuit driving only. \nDriving to emergency calls I find that as much part and parcel of my daily work and I \ndon\u2019t get a buzz out of it, I\u2019m just doing what I\u2019m here to do and touch wood three \nyears on I haven\u2019t been involved in collisions and I\u2019ve been doing that daily. During a \npursuit I get a huge adrenaline flow there is no question about that and my senses get \nvery very sharp and heightened. You need to be able to control that so that you don\u2019t \nget overconfident, go into hazards too quickly, brake too late, that type of thing, the \nthrill of the chase. As an advanced driver certainly if you can control that then you\u2019re \nnine tenths of the way there. \n \nHere, the participant is laying out the ground rules or prerequisites for the rationality \nand awareness which are so prevalent in participants\u2019 accounts of their driving \nbehaviour and accident involvement. In other words, he is regulated to the point \nwhere the process of emergency driving is rendered mundane - \u2018part and parcel of my \ndaily work\u2019 and is therefore quotidian and unremarkable rather than something that he \ngets a \u2018buzz out of\u2019. In presenting and managing his identity as a driver, he presents \nhimself as a master of self management. The \u2018huge adrenaline flow\u2019 - itself a \nrhetorical flourish rather than the result of blood tests - is not described as being \ndisabling, but is something that makes his senses \u2018very very sharp and heightened\u2019 \nIndeed, this is a large part - \u2018nine tenths\u2019 - of being an advanced driver. Again, the use \nof technical terms, the precise estimation of proportions \u2018nine tenths\u2019 - the recognition \nof pitfalls - \u2018overconfidence\u2019 - presents a picture of superior awareness, not only of \nthe external geography of hazard, but the interior psychological landscape too - \nalmost as if the machinery inside the person was susceptible to rational management \nin the same way as the skill of driving itself. The argument that new technologies and \nworking practices lead to shifts in consciousness and new ways of conceiving of the \nself has been made most forcefully by Rose (e.g. 1999). The psyche then, in this \nofficer\u2019s formulation is something that is not only susceptible to this kind of self \nexamination but also improvement and redevelopment.  \nGeneral Discussion \nHaving examined the transcripts, what are we to make of the theoretical concepts with \nwhich we began this paper? What can we say about cognitive aspects of risk taking \nsuch as the illusion of invulnerability? The present study has highlighted that the \nclassic psychological formulation of risk-taking is called into question and revised by \na close attention to the interview material. That is, it is difficult to see the participants\u2019 \naccounts yielding any straightforward support for a model of risk taking and human \nerror which emphasises ignorance, underestimation of risk or a sense that \u2018it won\u2019t \nhappen to me\u2019. Rather, the officers construct themselves as a low point in their \ncultural topography of risk - \u201cI believe that we are quite a low insurance risk\u201d (Officer \n9) - and as contending with the hazards poised by other road users. This in turn means \nthat they are presented as representing safety rather than hazard, and by dint of cost-\nbenefit analysis, to be managing risk in a downward direction for themselves and the \npublic, all of which is contingent on their keeping the malfeasant \u2018adrenaline\u2019 under \ncontrol through a process of self awareness and self management. \n \nMuch psychological investigation of human responses to risk, chance and uncertainty \nhas been haunted by the legacy of psychoanalysis. The frequently-detected self-\nserving biases and illusions of invulnerability are often assumed to reflect some \ndefence against the anxiety that might arise when people are confronted with a \nchaotic and threatening environment. This assumption has led educators to try to \ninculcate an awareness of hazards, a \u2018realistic\u2019 appreciation of the risks involved and \na desire to take precautions. However, one implication of the material presented here \nis that this may have the very opposite effect in that it will give people more resources \nwith which to justify risky courses of action. In a sense, it might help them make \nbetter excuses equip them with new techniques for undertaking a discursive process \nof neutralising them, so as to facilitate risky courses of action. \n \nWhilst this may seem like a paradoxical assertion, it is not beyond the bounds of \npossibility, and has parallels with some well established traditions and findings in \npsychology. People report being comfortable with a higher level of risk if they believe \nthat safety features such as anti-lock brakes are present (Jonah et al, 2000). Indeed, \nrisk homeostasis theory (McKenna, 1985) is predicated on this kind of compensation \nfor safety. Hitherto it has mostly been studied with regards to physical safety features, \nbut it is also demonstrable where psychological and behavioural precautions are \nconcerned. People who regularly use condoms perceive themselves to be at lower risk \nHIV infection (Thompson et al, 1996). The idea that training can actually increase \nrisk taking was even alluded to by one of the participants himself: \nInterviewer: Do you think that some police drivers you know would benefit from \nfurther training? \nOfficer 10: \u201cOh God yes definitely. The worst thing is when people just come off \ntheir driving test, there was an accident last night, chap just come off, lost it when he \nhit the central reservation, might have a broken bone and he had to go to hospital. \nWhen you have just come off driving test that\u2019s the time when people have accidents, \nfirst six months, red mist time. They build you up, people think they are invincible \nbecause of all this building up, you go faster and faster and faster yes I can understand \nyou want to be a confident driver but that\u2019s the problem.\u201d \n \nThis idea that the \u2018building-up\u2019 process in training increases risk taking is consistent \nwith our intimation from the interview material. Enhancing peoples\u2019 awareness of \nhazards may increase their ability to justify themselves.  \n \nIn studies on naive participants, making them accountable for their driving skill \nreduces positive self-evaluations (McKenna & Myers, 1997). However, our \nparticipants appear to be expert account-givers - indeed, working as a police officer \ninvolves much of this activity, for example giving evidence, compiling reports and \nresponding to inquiries from colleagues. The culture of many public service \norganisations emphasises the necessity of ensuring that practice is aligned with \nguidelines and regulations, so account-giving may well be more familiar and expertly \naccomplished by participants in our study.  This process of accounting for accidents \nwhich we have described in the present paper may also contain some clues towards \nthe further investigation of accidents in other groups of drivers particularly \nprofessional drivers with additional driver training.  The tendency to attribute the \ncauses of accidents to unfavourable conditions or to unpredictable behaviour from \nother drivers may well be detectable if one were to examine accounts of accidents \nmore generally.  We would like to enter a plea for researchers and policy makers to \nconsider seriously the process of account formulation when investigating accidents \nand conducting research on safety.  The methodology offers valuable insights into the \npotential relationship between organisational culture, stress and accident involvement, \nas an essential starting point for any investigation of safety issues. \n \nThus, we would like to suggest a shift in the focus of risk study, towards an \nunderstanding of risk as a discursive phenomenon. Once we make sense of the stories \npeople tell about hazards we might be able to genuinely improve training and enable \npeople not merely to justify themselves or make claims that they are controlling their \nemotions, but to engage in a critical dialogue about driving practices. The participants \nare already expert in storytelling and new ways could be developed of utilising these \nskills to enable critical analysis rather than self-justificatory accounting. It might be \npossible to revise their implicit models of risk so they can see themselves as potential \nhazards rather than the other road users. In any event, the possibility that training and \nawareness on the part of drivers may increase the level of risk taken by drivers is one \nwhich must be taken very seriously in future research and policy on the issue. \nAlthough the present study is concerned with retrospective accounts, it highlights \nroom for improvement in the cognitive skills of police drivers. Much driver training \naddresses \u2018low\u2019 level skills such as vehicle handling and very rarely considers \u2018high\u2019 \nlevel skills such as appraisal of the driving task demands. Cognitive competencies in \nmaking safety-oriented decisions are vital in training for police drivers and yet are the \nmost difficult to train. In particular, a focus on operational and occupational safety \nthrough cognitive skills training is desirable. Strategies that change the internal \ncontext of cognition and motivation that a driver brings to the task can be addressed. \nThere are a range of possible targets for specific maladaptive cognitions such as \nrunning a red light as a way of adhering to target response times. The vast majority of \ndriver training programmes do not consider emotions and cognitions that are \nappropriate for driving; yet this study suggests their important role in driving \nbehaviour. Officers in the present study frequently emphasised the importance of \nmanaging one\u2019s own emotional and cognitive state whilst evaluating incidents and \ndriving to them so training could profitably build upon this skill. There is also a need \nto focus on the question of self-confidence, since over-confident drivers may \noverestimate their skills, especially in emotionally charged situations (Joffe, 1999). \nTherefore, training should attempt to reorientate driving cognitions so that they are \nbased in reality rather through distorted perceptions. One possible strategy for \nintervention might be the development of social skills for avoiding conflict such as \ndefensive driving, anger management training, or even giving officers strategies to \nresist a peer culture which values rapid responses and aggressive driving techniques. \n  \nWhereas much of the work of psychology on the process of risk taking has \nemphasised the relationship between this and stable, biologically-based personality \nfactors (e.g. Zuckerman & Kuhlman, 2000) we have sought to open up another \npossibility. That is we have sought to show how the process of risk taking is \nconnected with a variety of moment-to-moment practices of accounting, formulating \nevents and assigning culpability for the hazard. The data presented above, we hope, \nwill emphasise the way that living and working in a context of risk is a continuous \naccomplishment and is constructed and reconstructed by officers in situ using a set of \nlinguistic conventions, culturally available resources of meaning and folk \npsychologies which afford and enable their daily work. Attending to these practices of \naccounting, formulating and narrating events will, we hope, bring researchers and \npolicymakers into closer contact with the everyday practical accomplishment of living \nand working with risk. In this way these practices may be understood and even \ntransformed so as to enhance safety for the public and officers alike. There is a real \nneed to review police policy with respect to police driver training. A first step would \nbe to incorporate the above recommendations to bring police driver training into line \nwith community expectations and help improve the standards of police driving.  \nReferences \n \nBell, B.E., Loftus, E.F., 1988.
