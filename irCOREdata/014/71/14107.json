This paper describes a project that has\ndeveloped a prototype for a pedagogy planning tool that can scaffold the process of learning\ndesign innovation. It is designed for lecturers who are experienced in traditional modes of teach-\ning and learning and may have experience of some learning technologies but who need support\nin making the optimal use of alternative teaching methods for their learners, especially those\nbased on digital technologies. The tool is being designed to build a collaborative online commu-\nnity that enables lecturers to develop and share their learning designs.\nLearning design is defined as: \u2018an application of a pedagogical model for a specific learning\nobjective, target group and a specific context or knowledge\u2019 (Conole and Oliver 2006, 5).\nA \u2018learning design\u2019 in the context of this project is seen as a multilayered plan, linking aims,\nlearning outcomes, teaching methods, staff and student workload and a schedule of learning\nactivities (see also Beetham 2004). The plan will operate on different levels of description of the\nlearning process, for example: \n\u25cf \u2018learning activity\u2019 \u2013 a collection of activities such as reading, discussing, experimenting,\netc., intended to meet a specific learning outcome;\n\u25cf \u2018session\u2019 \u2013 a set of learning activities intended for a short period of time;\n*Corresponding author. Email: j.san-diego@ioe.ac.uk\n16  J.P. San Diego et al.\n\u25cf \u2018module\u2019 \u2013 a set of sessions making up a unit within a programme leading to an award, e.g.\na bachelor\u2019s degree.\nThe intention is that with sufficient support from a specially designed tool that meets their needs\nand aspirations lecturers will be enabled to lead the exploration and improvement of the new e-\nlearning pedagogies.\nThe following sections review some of the current approaches to learning design and identify\nthe issues and requirements for a learning design system that can support analytical thinking. We\nthen describe the initial technical design and the user-oriented approach taken in developing the\nLondon Pedagogy Planner (LPP). Initial evaluation results are presented which show illustrative\nexamples of visual representations used with lecturers\u2019 feedback based on interviews and work-\nshops using the current prototype. The paper concludes with a specification for an analytical\napproach to learning design and the direction of future work.\nCurrent approaches to learning designs\nThe purpose of a pedagogy planner is to offer a way of enabling teachers to exploit technology\nwhile creating pedagogically sound activities, as proposed in the LADIE Report on learning\ndesign (Conole et al. 2005). Teachers and lecturers are not typically learning design specialists,\nand while they may develop expertise in conventional teaching methods, it is much harder to do\nso for technology-based methods. Despite much localized innovation (Becta 2006; Beetham\n2004; Joint Information Systems Committee [JISC] 2007), progress towards mainstreaming tech-\nnology-enhanced learning (TEL) and optimizing its value is inevitably slow, as teachers lack\ntime, supporting resources or training (Beetham 2004; Britain and Liber 2004). This is a problem\nthat still needs to be addressed (Sharpe and Oliver 2007). The Mod4L project, within the JISC\nDesign for Learning Programme, has reported a wide range of approaches to modelling practice\n(Falconer et al. 2007), including text, tables, charts, maps and diagrams.\nThe LPP project has reviewed several ways of representing learning design (see Table 1),\neach of which have a particular set of pedagogical benefits. However, many of them cover only\na partial account of the learning design process. The different approaches presented in Table 1\nshow several attempts to elaborate the ways teachers think about learning designs. From an\nanalysis of the full range of features offered in these separate approaches we argue that a more\ncomprehensive learning design system could incorporate all of the following features: \n\u25cf multilevel planning, i.e. course, module, session, activity and object;\n\u25cf flexible editing and adaptability to users\u2019 needs;\n\u25cf ease of use and simple manipulatable learning design components;\n\u25cf a way of capturing the context of learning design that can be easily understood, interpreted,\nevaluated and shared;\n\u25cf an instantiation of learning designs as a sequence of learning activities;\n\u25cf support for teacher collaboration;\n\u25cf alternative forms of external representations, giving lecturers the option to work with\nstructured text or concept-mapping representations, etc.;\n\u25cf a way of ensuring coherence between each of the components of learning designs such as\ntopics, outcomes, methods, tools, staff resources and student workloads.\nTable 1 also enables us to see that there are several important features of the learning design\nprocess that remain unsupported by any of these approaches. For example, there is no existing\napproach that offers default data for learning design components that covers workload of teachers\nand teachers\u2019 plan for students\u2019 time. Models of this kind can be helpful for teachers (Agostinho\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology  17\n2006) who use such external representations of learning design as: (i) aids for communicating and\ndiscussing pedagogical ideas; (ii) a way of capturing an implemented design; (iii) support for\nanalysing and reflecting on a design; (iv) instant access to informative ways of understanding the\npedagogic approach (Cameron 2007). For example, there are some lecturers who in their practice\nTable 1. Current representations of learning designs.\nRepresentations of learning design Pedagogic benefits\nA text-based course outline typically created \nusing word processors or electronic \nspreadsheets (\u2018standard\u2019 university templates)\nLists the basic components required by local institutions\nA \u2018tabular\u2019 text-based planner which considers \nissues around the components of learning \ndesign (Beetham 2004)\nSuggests integration of technology has to be carried out \nat different levels, i.e. programme, course, session and \nlinking e-learning theories to practice, based on a case \nstudy approach\nEncourages reflection through questions given about \nissues of some of the components of learning design\nStructured texts and tables to establish a set of \nstandard \u2018learning patterns\u2019 (Goodyear 2005)\nEstablishes a standard vocabulary for distinguishing \nbetweendifferent types of learning design, using a pattern \nframeworkwith standard features for the different \nmethods, such as learningtasks (e.g. discuss, debate, \ninvestigate), organizational forms (e.g. dyad, T-group, \nproject team) and learning environment (e.g. virtual \nlibrary, chat room, textbook)\nTeam-based course design using conceptual \nmapping techniques (Inglis and Bradley 2005)\nSpecifies components of learning design and the \nrelationship between them at course level\nInforms a sequence of topics and outcomes within a \ncourse \u2013 provides a \u2018synoptic\u2019 view of a course\nMakes relationship between components\nA workflow diagram of a runnable of activities \nat the session level sequence (Dalziel 2003)\nCreates a runnable representation of a sequence of \nlearning activities, particularly for collaborative learner \nexperiences\nAlso offers a learner monitoring environment \nvisualization that shows which activity learners are \ninteracting with at a particular point in time\nA concept mapping technique with text as \nannotation of sequences of learning objects \nwith references to pedagogic patterns (Carle, \nCanny, and Clancy 2006)\nShows learner-centred courses along with the patterns \nthat inspired the design\nCaptures instructional expertise in a useful way for others\nEncourages experimentation with, and adoption of, best \npedagogic practice\nGuides teachers in framing course goals and refining \ncourses to meet them\nOffers a cohesive framework applicable across a range of \ninstructional settings\nA decision-making system based on \u2018expert\u2019 \nmodels that uses the notion of a learning \nactivity that revolves around context, learning \nand teaching approaches and tasks (Conole and \nFill 2005)\nProvides a structured resource to plan, scope and cost an \nactivity\nHelps to reduce the time and easy-to-use\nProvides guidance, which is not prescriptive\nAdapts for customization to the local context\nProvides a comprehensive resource of relevant material \nand database for activities\nA web-based wiki type approach to reconciling \ncontextual issues and to providing guidance to \ntechnology use (Masterman and Manton 2007)\nOffers guidance, links to research summaries, examples \nfor using e-learning teaching methods\nCommunity generated terminologies and guidance\n18  J.P. San Diego et al.\ntranslate the course design into a \u2018weekly schedule\u2019 based on their professional judgment (Inglis\nand Bradley 2005). It is important to explicitly show a model that can help teachers reflect on the\ntimings they intend for learners and how, for example, their choice of teaching methods impacts\non their workload and students cognitive activities (Laurillard 2006).\nA second omission relates to the need to be able to contextualize a \u2018runnable\u2019 design by\nlinking it with a corresponding \u2018inspirational\u2019 design, and there is no support given to lecturers\nthat aims to help them in making this link (Falconer et al. 2007) nor one that operates at different\nlevels, i.e. programme, course, session (Beetham 2004).\nBased on these analyses, the LPP project claims to construct a more comprehensive tool to\nsupport leaning design.\nIssues and requirements relevant to modelling learning design\nThe LPP project began by interviewing lecturers about their current approaches to course, module\nand session design. We then used storyboard and initial prototypes of the LPP tool as a way of\nboth emulating their current practice and engaging them in a more reflective design process. This\niterative user-oriented design approach (described in more detail in later sections) gave us the\nmeans to elicit a more detailed set of specifications for the LPP tool. \n\u25cf Pedagogic issues. One of the basic principles of design in educational technology is that\ntopic aims need to be linked to learning outcomes, to assessment methods and to the\nintervening teaching methods. Whilst many of the existing systems support listing of\ncomponents of learning design, they are often defined separately in the documentation. It\nwould be helpful, therefore, to offer a mapping option to make explicit links between these\nfeatures once they have been defined.\n\u25cf Contextual and cultural issues. Different institutions and departments use different termi-\nnologies for the features in a learning design. The unit of design may be referred to as a\n\u2018programme\u2019, \u2018course\u2019, \u2018module\u2019, \u2018session\u2019 or \u2018unit\u2019, and each of these can refer to widely\ndifferent timescales of learning activity. The word \u2018lecture\u2019 can be interpreted quite differ-\nently according to local custom. Team teaching may be common in one institution, rare in\nanother. A pedagogy planner must be adaptable and flexible, therefore, if it is to fit institu-\ntional requirements.\n\u25cf Representation and visualisation issues. It is important to provide visualizations of the\ninputs to and outputs from the design process that prompt lecturers to reflect on their prac-\ntice. Lecturers have different preferences for ways of representing the implications of their\ndecisions and we need to experiment with a range of choices as the different stages, e.g.\nconcept maps, lists, text, flowcharts, diagrams, schedules, charts, tables, pie-charts, etc.\n\u25cf Balance of control over data. Lecturers need to input their own data if they are to engage\nfully in the process of designing learning. However, they must also find it very quick and\neasy to make sense of the process and complete a draft design. To this end, the tool offers\ndefault data at every opportunity (e.g. pre-selected teaching methods, default number of\nstaff hours to prepare a 1 hour lecture or an online discussion, default proportion of learner\ntime spent on different cognitive activities for each teaching method). All the default data\noffered must, of course, be easily editable by the user to fit their own context.\n\u25cf Flexible database design. The data on definitions of components and their parameterized\nvalues are held in a database. The database design reflects the links between the compo-\nnents and enables users to begin at any stage in the design process. Each decision overwrites\ndefault data or earlier decisions and each stage calls on the most recent entry for that data\nitem \u2013 if a teaching method is added at the \u2018scheduling\u2019 stage, for example, it will appear\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology  19\nin the list of teaching methods in the \u2018module outline\u2019 stage, with default data on staff\npreparation time ready for use or for editing. This flexibility is essential, because lecturers\ncontinually iterate between the different levels of granularity of their learning design and\nhave different preferences for where to begin.\n\u25cf Ownership. The pedagogy planning tool is for lecturers\u2019 own use and it should be their deci-\nsion whether any part of their learning design is made available to peer teachers and manag-\ners. It is designed to also be used as an online collaborative model with a team of lecturers\nworking together on a master copy and progressive versions. There is a concern, however,\nthat the tool intended for lecturers\u2019 personal use may be taken over by managers as an\nadministrative tool. It could be used in this way, with appropriate safeguards, but begins as\na tool that uses authentication and permissions that are personal to the user.\nThis set of issues contribute to the requirements for developing a pedagogy planner tool. Thus the\nmain functions of a pedagogy planner are to support the following.\nPlanning\nEnsuring that all the components of learning design (such as educational aims, learners\u2019 needs,\nlearning activities and intended outcomes) are addressed and are compatible with each other, at\ndifferent levels of description, which may be defined as course, module, session or learning\nactivity.\nDecision-making\nHelping lecturers make decisions by feeding back the implications of one decision on another part\nof the process, using an inspectable and editable model of the internal relations between compo-\nnents, and representing their resulting design in a clear way.\nProgressive innovation\nLinking each decision to relevant online advice on learning design (such as the community-gener-\nated advice being developed in the complementary JISC-funded Phoebe project1 in the UK)\nonline learning object repositories (e.g. JORUM,2 OpenLearn3 and RLO-CETL4), case studies\n(e.g. CDE,5 TLRP,6 Becta,7 JISC,8 NIACE9 and HEA10), learning designs (from the D4L\nprogramme11), distillations of educational research findings (e.g. TLRP briefings, JISC briefings,\nBecta reports, HEA summaries and searches on journals) and any local information about learner\nneeds (e.g. feedback surveys and examiners\u2019 reports).\nAnalysis\nInspecting and editing the explicit model of internal relations (e.g. the allocation of staff time for\npreparation and presentation of each teaching method used; the proportion of different cognitive\nactivities that a selected teaching method facilitates) and comparing the effects of different learn-\ning designs (e.g. how the use of different teaching methods affects staff workload and cognitive\nactivity).\nCollaboration\nBuilding a community of practice, where lecturers can discuss and share learning designs, learn\nfrom each other and build on each others\u2019 ideas.\n20  J.P. San Diego et al.\nAdministration\nAllocating lecturers\u2019 time, learners\u2019 time, estimating comparative costs, publishing schedules for\nmodules or sessions and producing module level planning for administrative purposes.\nA user-oriented approach to developing requirements\nTo be able to build a pedagogy planning tool that lecturers would actually use it was essential to\ninvolve them in the design and development process throughout the project. A small group of\nlecturers from the two partner institutions were funded to take part as informant-practitioners\n(Conole et al. 2004; Laurillard and McAndrew 2003; Oliver et al. 2002). The design of the first\nprototype began with a set of interviews with five informant-practitioner lecturers from partner\ninstitutions. The participants were chosen based on their experience in using learning technolo-\ngies within their teaching. The interviews covered their practice in designing learning with and\nwithout technology. From these interviews it was clear that lecturers plan learning in different\nways, starting from different levels of description of the learning process, although most used\nonly word processing tools and a text-based plan. The interview confirmed the issues identified\nabove and also generated some other requirements related to interface manipulation and interface\nrepresentations (and usability, which will not be covered in this paper).\nThe development of the tool focused around the design issues identified from different data\nsources. The analysis of data from initial interviews and existing literature provided the initial\nprototype design for the basic functionality needed for a planning tool. This was implemented\nfirst as an Excel spreadsheet, to test the selection of learning design components, the validity of\nthe relationships between them and the idea of a systematic approach to modelling learning\ndesign. The next prototype was developed from this using the Director multimedia authoring soft-\nware, to test the form of the visual representations to be used in the interface. Having validated\nthe basic functionality and interface representations, we then re-implemented these specifications\nto build the full prototype in Java.\nAn Agile method of development was adopted that includes iterative phases of design, devel-\nopment and evaluation (Boyle et al. 2006). The technical team responsible for development of the\ntool met regularly to discuss design issues emerging from trials with lecturers and to decide\ndesign priorities to address them. Several versions were released to the project team through a\n\u2018Google group\u2019 site for discussion and suggestions for changes. The site served as a way of\ndocumenting the features for each release, the discussion of results and the record of successive\nversions. For each phase of development trials were carried out with the lecturers linked to the\nproject, first as a storyboard using PowerPoint, with notes pages for each slide to gather\ncomments and answers to specific questions. Once the design has stabilized the next version of\nthe prototype is developed and tested in one-to-one or workshop sessions, gathering as much data\nas possible about the users\u2019 reactions and further requirements.\nThe design and development of the pedagogy planning tool proceeded from that point as a\ncontinually iterative process of \u2018interview \u2013 storyboard \u2013 feedback comments \u2013 prototype \u2013\nobservation of trial use \u2013 revision \u2013 new prototype\u2019. At each stage the feedback affecting design\nof the tool was recorded and reported in interim project reports. In this way we have successively\nrefined the description of user requirements and the prototype versions of the pedagogy planner\ntool.\nThe proposed approach to learning design\nAs part of the JISC \u2018Design for Learning\u2019 (D4L) programme the Mod4L project has examined\na range of practice models to determine how best to describe a formalized approach to\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology  21\nlearning design. The framework for the \u2018generic form of a learning design\u2019 includes attributes\nsuch as \u2018the forms of learning outcomes sought and achieved, e.g. forms of knowledge acqui-\nsition, skills, understandings\u2019, \u2018the role of technology, e.g. need for specialised software,\ncustom tools, communication requirements, processing needs, etc.\u2019 (Falconer et al. 2007). The\nproposal for the LPP was to cover the majority of these attributes, but to specifically exclude\nattributes such as access to technology or course information to prospective learners in order\nto focus on the design of learning itself. The rationale for the project was that lecturers need\npractical assistance in understanding how best to design activities for their learners, given the\nintended outcomes, the nature of the student body and the learning environment (Beetham\n2004).\nIt was important that the learning design process should produce a working product, as this\nmade the time spent worthwhile. To be able to do this the pedagogy planner tool had to make use\nof a model of the components of learning design and their interrelationships and link its output to\na runnable learning design environment. LAMS (Learning Activity Management System12) was\nchosen as the most highly developed environment of this kind currently available. The planner\ntool was conceived as a series of decision stages relating to the standard components of learning\ndesign as defined by the lecturers\u2019 module design templates already in use in their institutions.\nThe model underlying the tool was conceived as a simple mapping between components, standard\ndefinitions of the principal parameters for each teaching method or learning activity and default\nvalues for the principal resource parameters of staff time and student time needed. The model is\ninspectable, as a table of values or as a map of links, and is editable at each stage of the decision\nprocess.\nThe pedagogy planner tool is designed to offer a support tool for the kind of blended learning\ndesign that lecturers need to carry out, from the initial curriculum requirements, learner needs and\nresource constraints to e-learning activities in use by their students. The design is also aimed to\nallow well-developed existing tools and theoretical frameworks to be embedded or integrated\nwith the tool (e.g. LAMS). It is designed to produce runnable learning designs that embrace new\ntechnology.\nThe underlying principle of the pedagogy planner tool is to use current good practice to create\nand check the relationships between the different aspects of the user\u2019s input (e.g. balancing learn-\ners\u2019 resource and teaching time; linking topics, outcomes, methods, and assessments; supporting\ndecisions on sequencing and scope of topics; testing designs based on pedagogical frameworks;\nproviding exemplars and links to existing web-based resources). It is intended to address the\nissues identified in the previous section, such as providing enough flexibility to adapt to the needs\nof educational lecturers in different departmental and institutional contexts while enabling the\nsharing of expertise across contexts.\nModelling the detail of the learning design in terms of the time required of both staff and\nstudents involves a series of decisions, all of which are optional because they have default data\npre-assigned: \n\u25cf select teaching methods (TMs);\n\u25cf define maximum group sizes for relevant TMs;\n\u25cf estimate staff preparation and presentation time needed by TM;\n\u25cf define proportion of development that will reuse existing materials;\n\u25cf distribute learner\u2019s time over TMs;\n\u25cf define ratio of cognitive activities by TM;\n\u25cf inspect resultant staff workload;\n\u25cf divide staff workload between senior and support staff;\n\u25cf inspect plan for resource deployment across module.\n22  J.P. San Diego et al.\nThe structure of the model is a simple, logical relationship between the parameters (e.g. if the\nmodule has 50 students and the group size for a tutorial is defined as 10, then the module will\nhave 5 tutorial groups). The default parameters are exactly that \u2013 \u2018tutorial\u2019 group sizes range from\n2 to 30, for example, so these parameters will often be edited for the local context. Making the\nresults of design choices inspectable in this way has proved to be an illuminating process for\nlecturers, who begin to discover why they feel overworked. They have also discovered their\nunrealistic expectations of the time specified to be spent by their students.\nThe illustrative models with lecturers\u2019 feedback\nThe different tools and systems reviewed in the previous section have not shown many examples\non how the tools support teachers\u2019 analytical approach about their decisions in the learning design\nprocess. For each type of decision in the planning process it is important to test its feasibility in\nterms of appropriateness for lecturers and for interpretability (see also Laurillard, Boyle, et al.\n2007; Laurillard, San Diego, et al., 2007). There is no space to discuss here the full list of models\nimplemented in the LPP, but we can illustrate some of the models of the LPP with some of the\nevaluation results gathered through workshops, observations and feedback comments. First, we\ngive an example of workshop data collected to show the feasibility of an analytical approach to\nlearning design, then we illustrate how the analytical approach worked with the lecturers in terms\nof representations of allocation of time to teaching methods and resultant cognitive activities,\nmapping of different components of learning design, how scheduling of topics are mapped to\noutcomes, selection of learning design based on learners\u2019 needs and the default taxonomy of\nlearning design and annotations of the activity sequence.\nSeveral one-to-one observations were carried out with the lecturers associated with the project,\nbut in order to evaluate the tool with larger numbers we also used workshops of up to 20 lecturers\nat a time. The aim was to find out whether the tool prompts lecturers to analyse a learning design\nusing visual representations of their decisions in the process of design. In the workshop setting\neach user worked on their own design, answering questions on a worksheet as they progressed.\nThe worksheet items correspond to the functionalities being tested. For example, in Figure 1 item\n2 records the lecturer\u2019s feedback on the feature that distributes time to teaching methods.\nFigure 1. Worksheet data from a workshop participantThe interim evaluation with lecturers to date suggests that lecturers appreciate the value of a\nsystematic approach to modelling their learning design, making their decisions explicit and editable.\nFigure 1. Worksheet data from a workshop participant.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology  23\nIn the workshops conducted so far 42 out of 51 (82%) of the participants agreed that the pedagogy\nplanner is a worthwhile development, while 3 out of 51 did not agree, 2 out of 51 were unsure and\n4 out of 51 gave no response. 28 out of 51 participants were willing to be contacted for follow-up\non their feedback, while 13 out of 51 were willing to be contacted for future user testing.\nThe following are extracts from the lecturers notes that show the kinds of analytical thinking\nfor each of the examples of the representations of their learning design process.\nPlanning at the module level\nFigure 2a shows how the teacher has distributed the total credit hours (100) among the teaching\nmethods they have elected to use (lectures, tutorials, Tutor Marked Assignments and online asyn-\nchronous conferencing). Each teaching method has default data on the proportion of cognitive\nactivities it elicits in learners, e.g. \u2018lecture\u2019 elicits mainly \u2018attention\u2019. While engaging on this part\nof the planner one evaluator commented on its value as a way for teachers to pass on their learning\ndesigns: \u2018Would also think about it as a hand-over tool from one module convenor to another\u2019.\nFigure 2b illustrates how the teacher has shifted some of the time allotted to tutorials and\nlectures to online asynchronous conferencing. A pop-up box offers a link to a research summary\nthat provides the basis for the default data for tutorials and online conferences. The planner auto-\nmatically calculates the learner experience, given the hours for each teaching method. The planner\nautomatically puts in the learner experience data and calculates the new distribution across the\ntotal hours. One lecturer during a hands-on workshop commented: \u2018I am not asking them (students)\nto do things on their own \u2026 I have changed those (timings) \u2026 It does make you think, doesn\u2019t it?\u2019\nFigure 2. Allocating time to teaching methods and resultant cognitive activities. This figure also shows \u2018a pop-up text\u2019 as a user-specified functionality on how a link to online advice can be presented in the interface. Lecturers can then opt to \u2018expand\u2019 the allocation of hours in terms of the different cognitive activities they elicit. Lecturers have access to default online definitions of the cognitive activities given. For example \u2018attention\u2019 as the learning activity elicited whenlearners are passive, in comparison with \u2018discu sion\u2019, meaning that for this teaching method learners spend some tim  reading but a much greater proportion in active preparation for or p rticipation in or refl ction on discussion.A different kind of representation is the mapping between components, e.g. to ensure appro-\npriate linking between topics and outcomes. After having entered topics and learning outcomes,\nby \u2018drawing\u2019 a line using the mouse the teacher can ensure mapping between components (e.g.\ntopics listed on the left side of Figure 3 to selected outcomes on the right). It becomes very obvi-\nous if there is a learning outcome that is not covered, which forces consideration of whether it\nshould be, and if so how. Teachers often want larger text boxes to describe topics and outcomes,\nso these can be entered and recalled as rollover text. One tutor commented: \u2018The mapping\nprinciple is sound, and multiple mappings are important \u2013 really nice and visual\u2019.\nFigure 3. Ensuring appropriate linking between topics (left) and outcomes (right)The schedule interface in Figure 4 shows topics listed in the top part, automatically inherited\nfrom Figure 3. Beside the list is a \u2018calendar-like\u2019 visualization, below which is a visualization for\nthe outcomes previously linked to those topics. The tool then offers the functionality to schedule\nwhich topics are to be covered in which weeks: clicking on a \u2018cell\u2019 for a topic also highlights the\ncorresponding \u2018cells\u2019 for the linked outcomes for each week. With this visualization lecturers may\nreflect on the number of learning outcomes they are asking learners to tackle within a week. If\nthey seem unbalanced they can easily edit the schedule by clicking and dragging boxes represent-\ning topics. Commenting on this functionality one tutor reported: \u2018I like this very much, because\nit\u2019s mapped in my topics for me and it\u2019s showing me them in weeks and it\u2019s showing where they\ncan overlap\u2019.\nFigure 4. Scheduling of topics, with the previously linked outcomes also shown\nPlanning at the session level\nHaving identified the learners\u2019 needs, the teacher can now select, from several possible learning\ndesigns, the one they wish to pursue in order to investigate existing examples on which they might\nbuild (Figure 5). As one tutor commented: \u2018It encourages thinking outside the current teaching\nbox and therefore [the use of] other methods\u2019.\nFigure 5. Learning design selection relevant to learners\u2019 needsThe session plan for learners\u2019 activities can be implemented as an activity sequence in LAMS,\nwhich then runs online, managing the student group through their individual and collaborative\n24  J.P. San Diego et al.\nactivities or directing them to conventional offline activities (Figure 6). Teachers can annotate the\nsequence representation in the LPP, which can give guidance on different types of tool for a\nparticular activity from the community-owned resource bank, which evaluators of the \u2018Phoebe\u2019\nprototype planner tool have found particularly useful: \u2018The types of content \u2013 not come across\nanything that does that type of thing before, things that people do need to think about but don\u2019t\nalways do\u2019.\nFigure 6. Annotation of the learning activity sequence in LAMS\nConcluding points and future research: groundwork towards a user-oriented analytical \napproach to learning design\nThe LPP is based on a model of the critical relationships between the components of learning\ndesign and aims to make the use and development of this model accessible to lecturers. The\nunderlying model is itself a representation of current theoretical frameworks for learning design.\nWe have seen that the interface design for the component features, while still needing further\nFigure 2. Allocating time to teaching methods and resultant cognitive activities. This figure also shows\n\u2018a pop-up text\u2019 as a user-specified functionality on how a link to online advice can be presented in the\ninterface. Lecturers can then opt to \u2018expand\u2019 the allocation of hours in terms of the different cognitive\nactivities they elicit. Lecturers have access to default online definitions of the cognitive activities given. For\nexample \u2018attention\u2019 as the learning activity elicited when learners are passive, in comparison with \u2018discus-\nsion\u2019, meaning that for this learning activity learners spend some time listening but a much greater propor-\ntion in active preparation for or participation in or reflection on discussion.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology  25\ndevelopment, clearly answers their design needs. In general the feedback from lecturers suggests\nthat: \n\u25cf the tool provides the kinds of support lecturers need to assist them in learning design for\nnew technologies;\n\u25cf the visual representations of learning design decisions and their consequences are\nwelcomed, and workable;\nFigure 3. Ensuring appropriate linking between topics (left) and outcomes (right).\nFigure 4. Scheduling of topics, with the previously linked outcomes also shown.\n26  J.P. San Diego et al.\n\u25cf the design process was quite straightforward, but even at this level prompts lecturers to\nreconsider their responses and to see links within their module they had not previously\nnoticed;\n\u25cf the approach of offering default input for design decisions that users can edit or accept is\nan efficient way of enabling lecturers to work quickly to understand how to use the tool and\nto use it at the level of analytical detail they prefer;\n\u25cf lecturers want integration with VLEs and the means to manage the development and\nsharing of a large number of learning designs.\nThere are many issues still to be resolved, for example how to represent alternative learning theo-\nries, how to establish a unified understanding of the terminologies related to learning design, how\nFigure 5. Learning design selection relevant to learners\u2019 needs.\nFigure 6. Annotation of the learning activity sequence in LAMS.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology  27\nto offer a choice of representation, how to track ownership of shared designs, etc. Nonetheless,\nthis style of pedagogy planner provides an effective way to explore these issues.\nThis research will help inform design-based research. We hope that this tool will aid teachers\nto be researchers in their own classroom as we are exploring ways in which teachers can generate\nresearch data from use of the tool that tests their practice in the form of their design. This is possi-\nble by extending the functionality of the tool so that teachers can feedback what has transpired\nduring their teaching back into the LPP and can analyse their inspirational design in comparison\nwith what has transpired.\nAt present we have not yet isolated the best way to link to external learning activity\nsystems such as LAMS and have not yet fully clarified the requirements to make the tool\ncollaborative. This is the subject of further research. The work to date has shown that the\nlecturers are enthusiastic about the idea of an interactive and collaborative planning tool for\nlearning design. We have also been able to clarify some of the essential requirements for such a\ntool. Our findings are: \n\u25cf a pedagogy planner must have enough flexibility to support lecturer planning and design\nprocesses at different levels of granularity \u2013 module and session levels certainly, but\nextending it also to activities within sessions and to aggregating modules into courses and\neven degree programmes;\n\u25cf within each level of granularity lecturers want to be able to link to advice on fundamental\naspects of learning design;\n\u25cf a system that offers default \u2018data\u2019 input seems to be effective in guiding lecturers\u2019 use of\nthe tool and the decision-making involved;\n\u25cf lecturers appreciate having visual representations to help them think through the learning\ndesign decisions they make at each level;\n\u25cf by making explicit the results of their decisions, using visual forms of representation,\nlecturers are able to reflect on what they bring to the classroom;\n\u25cf lecturers can be designers and act as researchers of the learning experience they are facili-\ntating for their learners;\n\u25cf it is feasible to model lecturers\u2019 approaches to learning design with sufficient flexibility that\nit can support a range of such approaches.\nWe aim to address the challenge of providing a design environment in which lecturers can benefit\nfrom representations of explicit learning design decisions, build on others\u2019 work, make use of\nlearning theories and existing resources, test them in practice and thereby support innovative\nlearning designs. In this way we hope to give lecturers the time and the means to become more\nclosely involved in the design of e-learning pedagogies. We are examining how the use of this\napproach can alter existing practices of teaching and learning.\nAcknowledgements\nThe London Pedagogy Planner project is funded over two years through the JISC Design for Learning\nProgramme and the University of London Centre for Distance Education.\nNotes\n1.
