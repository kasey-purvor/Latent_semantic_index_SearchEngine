We assume that the equip-\nment have two types of failures: minor and catastrophic. A minor failure can be\ncorrected by a minimal repair whereas a catastrophic failure can only be removed\nby a replacement. The equipment is assumed to be maintained at no charge to the\nconsumer during the warranty period, whereas the consumer is fully charged for\nany maintenance on failures after the extended warranty expires. We formulate the\nexpected life cycle cost of the equipment under a general failure time distribution,\nand then for special cases we prove that the optimal replacement and extended\nwarranty policies exist to minimise the expected life cycle cost per unit time, which\nis examined by numerical examples.\nKeywords: Life cycle cost; Warranty policy; Minimal repair;\nOpportunity-based replacement; Maintenance policy.\n1 Introduction\nThe life cycle cost (LCC) of a piece of equipment is the summa-\ntion of its cost estimates from inception to disposal. The objective\nof LCC analysis is to choose the most cost effective approach from\na set of alternatives so that the optimum long-run ownership cost\nfor the equipment is achieved. The basic elements of LCC may\ninvolve initial capital costs, operation costs, maintenance costs\n2 June 2011\nand disposal costs. Recently, LCC has been studied by many au-\nthors (Chung and Wee, 2008; Ahiska and King, 2010; Kleyner\nand Sandborn, 2008; Mascle and Zhao, 2008).\nReliability is one of the most important factors influencing the\nLCC of a piece of equipment as it is associated with many ele-\nments of the LCC. For example, a piece of equipment with higher\nreliability may involve higher initial capital costs, lower operation\ncosts, lower maintenance costs due to fewer failures and longer\noperation time, and may also incur lower disposal costs because\nof potential for reuse or resale. According to British Standard\n(1997), costs associated with equipment safety, reliability, main-\ntainability and maintenance support performance, which are not\nthat apparent but need to be accounted in LCC models, may\ninclude the following three elements, as appropriate: (1)Unavail-\nability costs: including maintenance costs and costs associated\nwith loss of equipment function, such as reduced productivity;\n(2) Warranty costs: for warranty-type agreements, and (3) Lia-\nbility costs: costs of liabilities due to equipment failure and their\ninjurious effects needs to be considered as part of the LCC.\nMaintenance and warranty policies that influence the above three\ncosts should therefore be considered in LCC analysis.\nFrom a consumer\u2019s perspective, maintenance costs may vary with\ndifferent maintenance policies. In past decades, a huge number of\nmaintenance policies have been proposed. More detailed discus-\nsion on maintenance policies can be found in Wang (2002) and\nWu and Zuo (2010). Among the existing maintenance policies, a\ncommonly used policy is a combination of corrective maintenance\nand opportunity-based age replacement: a piece of equipment is\nrepaired upon a minor failure, and replaced by a new identical\none at a predetermined age or on a catastrophic failure. This\nmaintenance policy is usually adopted in many industries such\nas maintaining building services systems.\nWarranty is also an important driver influencing maintenance\n2\ncosts and warranty costs. In a time order when a warranty policy\nis performed, it can be either a base warranty or a combination of\na base and an extended warranties. An extended warranty may\ncover maintenance cost for equipment after its manufacturer\u2019s\nbase warranty expires. The length of the extended warranty is\nimportant from a consumer\u2019s perspective. A long extended war-\nranty may be more costly when equipment is purchased, but it\ncan be more cost-effective in the long run as any replacements\nduring the extended warranty will be served by the warranty\nprovider.\nIn this study, we assume an opportunity-based age replacement.\nThat is: there are two types of failure: type I and type II failures;\ntype I failure is a minor failure which can be corrected by a\nminimal repair whereas type II failure is a catastrophic failure\nthat can only be corrected by a replacement. We also assume\nthat the length of the extended warranty policies is available for\nselection. Under these assumptions, we optimise the opportunity-\nbased age replacement policy and the length of the extended\nwarranty to minimise the expected life cycle cost per unit time.\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing\nliterature on maintenance policy optimisation considering war-\nranty. Section 3 formulates the expected life cycle cost and the\nexpected length of a life cycle. Section 4 is a discussion section.\nSection 5 offers numerical examples to validate the derived mod-\nels. The last section concludes with findings.\n2 Prior work\nThere is an increasing amount of work on the optimisation of\nmaintenance policies for equipment covered by warranty con-\ntracts. For a review of related research in this area, the reader\nis referred to Murthy and Djamaludin (2002). Publications ap-\npeared from year 2006 to year 2010 is briefly reviewed below.\n3\nMaintenance policy optimisation that considers warranties is stud-\nied by some authors. For example, Jack and Murthy (2007) in-\nvestigate optimal pricing strategies for the extended warranty\nprovider and optimal maintenance and replacement strategies for\nthe consumer. Wu and Li (2007), and Wu and Xie (2008) develop\nwarranty cost models for repairable and non-repairable equip-\nment with a dormant state, respectively. Yun et al. (2008) inves-\ntigate two warranty servicing strategies involving minimal and\nimperfect repairs, where the two strategies differ as to whether\nthe effectiveness of imperfect repair is dependent upon equipment\nage. Chien (2010) optimises age-replacement policies for equip-\nment under a new warranty strategy, where he combines a fully\nrenewable free replacement with a pro-rata warranty policy. Chen\nand Chien (2007) consider maintenance policy optimisation for\nequipment covered by warranty contracts and assume that the\nequipment have both type I and type II failures, and derive cost\nmodels and examine the effects of three PM options on the cost\nfrom both the manufacturer\u2019s and buyer\u2019s perspectives whilst as-\nsuming that the equipment are sold under a free-replacement re-\nnewing warranty. Jack et al. (2009) considers a maintenance pol-\nicy during the post-warranty period under the renewing warranty\npolicy, here the life cycle is defined from the user\u2019s perspective.\nHaving reviewed prior work one finds that little discussion has\nbeen made on the combination of extended warranty policies and\nopportunity-based replacement policies, while such a combina-\ntion is frequently used in practice, for example, in maintaining\nbuilding services systems.\n3 Problem formulation\nThere are a number of different warranty policies that have been\nstudied (Blischke and Murthy, 1994). In this paper, we consider\na NFRW (non-renewing free repair warranty) policy. Under an\nNFRW policy, the manufacturer guarantees a satisfactory service\n4\nonly during the base warranty period and the failed equipment is\nreplaced by the manufacturer at no cost to the user (NFRW) dur-\ning the base warranty period. A typical scenario of the different\nperiods in the life cycle is shown in Figure 1.\nFig. 1. The life cycle span\n3.1 Assumptions and notation\nAs above-mentioned, we consider an opportunity-based age re-\nplacement policy as follows. The following assumptions are held.\n\u2022 The equipment starts from time t = 0. The base warranty\nperiod is (0, w0] and the extended warranty period is (w0, w],\nwhere w = w0+kL, L is a given time period, and k(= 0, 1, 2, ...)\ncan be optimised.\n\u2022 The equipment has two types of possible failures at age t: minor\nfailure (or type I failure) and catastrophic failure (or type II\nfailure). A type I failure occurs with probability q(t) and can\nbe corrected with minimal repair that restores the equipment\nin the state it was before failure. A type II failure occurs with\nprobability 1\u2212 q(t) and can only be corrected by replacement.\n\u2022 Within the warranty time (0, w), upon failures, the equipment\nis corrected with either minimal repair or replacement. After\nthe extended warranty expires, the equipment is replaced either\nat pre-specified time td (where td > w) or upon type II failure,\nwhichever occurs first.\n\u2022 The equipment is maintained, for both minimal repair and\nreplacement, at no charge to the consumer during the base\nand extended warranty periods. Whereas the consumer is fully\ncharged for any maintenance when a failure, which can be type\nI failure or type II failure, occurs after the extended warranty\nexpires.\n5\n\u2022 The following costs are assumed.\n\u00b7 cI and CI are the repair coss per type I failure and the total\nrepair costs on type I failure after the extended warranty\nexpires, respectively;\n\u00b7 cII and CII are the replacement cost per type II failure and the\ntotal replacement cost on type II failure after the extended\nwarranty expires, respectively;\n\u00b7 cf and Cf are the unavailability and liability costs incurred\non a type I or type II failures, and the total unavailability\nand liability costs on type I or type II failures, respectively;\n\u00b7 ce and Ce are the cost of purchasing extended warranty for a\ntime period L, and the total warranty cost from a consumer\u2019s\nperspective, respectively;\n\u00b7 C0 and cd are the initial capital and the cost per replacement\nat time td, respectively.\n\u2022 Both the base warranty and the extended warranty are NFRW.\n\u2022 Time on either minimal repair or replacement is negligible.\n3.2 Model development\nAn optimal LCC may be chosen based on the following optimal\napproach:\n\u2022 Minimising LCC by choosing the optimal number of the ex-\ntended warranty periods k and the optimal design life td.\nWe derive the following life cycle cost. For other warranty policies,\nsimilar results can be obtained by using the following derivation\napproach.\nThe expected cost incurred during the life cycle can be defined\nas\nC(k, td) = C0 + Ce + E[CI] + E[CII] + E[Cf ], (1)\nwhere E[\u2022] represents the expected value.\n6\nAs the base warranty is an NFRW, the cost charged to the con-\nsumer for repair (due to type I failure) or replacement (due to\ntype II failure) within the base warranty period (0, w0] is 0. The\nextra cost for purchasing the extended warranty with length of\nkL is kce. Hence, from a consumer\u2019s perspective, the total cost\non the extended warranty within (0, w) is given by\nCe = kce. (2)\nDenote h(t) as the naked hazard function of the equipment.\nAccording to Block et al. (1985), the cumulative distribution\nfunction of time to type I failures, x, is given by FI(x) = 1 \u2212\nexp {\u2212 \u222b x0 q(t)h(t)dt} and the lifetime distribution between suc-\ncessive type II failures, is FII(z) = 1\u2212 exp {\u2212 \u222b z0 (1\u2212 q(t))h(t)dt}.\nLet zi be the time between the (i \u2212 1)-th and the i-th type II\nfailures and Sn =\n\u2211n\ni=1 zi (S0 = 0, by convention). Denote N(t)\nas the number of replacements within time interval (0, t) so that\nN(t) = max{n : Sn < t}. Then, {N(t), t \u2265 0} is a renewal\nprocess, Pr(N(t) = i) = F\n(i)\nII (t) \u2212 F (i+1)II (t) and the expected\nvalue of N(t) is given by M(t) = E(N(t)) =\n\u2211\u221e\ni=1 F\n(i)\nII (t), where\nM(t) is the renewal function, and F\n(i)\nII (t) is the i-fold convolution\nof FII(t) with F\n(0)\nII (t) = 1. M(t) can also be re-written as\nM(t) = FII(t) +\nt\u222b\n0\nM(t\u2212 x)dFII(x). (3)\nFig. 2. Excess of the renewal process\nDenote Nw = max{n : SNw < w}, and SNw = \u2211N(w)i=1 zi. The\nrelationship between SNw and w(= w0 + kL) is shown in Figure\n2. Denote Aw\ndef= w \u2212 SNw and denote Yw as the time to the next\ntype II failure after time point w. According to Karlin and Taylor\n7\n(2007), the distribution function of Aw is given by\nHw(y) = Pr(Aw < y) = FII(w)\u2212\nw\u2212y\u222b\n0\n(1\u2212 FII(w \u2212 t))dM(t),(4)\nThe distribution function of Yw is given by\nGw(y) =\nFII(w + y)\u2212 FII(w)\n1\u2212 FII(w) (5)\nOn the other hand, given that the equipment has survived Aw =\nw \u2212 SNw time units, the distribution of time to the first type I\nfailure is\nGI(x) = Pr(XI < x+ w \u2212 SNw|XI > w \u2212 SNw)\n=\nPr(XI \u2212 Aw < x)\u2212 Pr(XI \u2212 Aw < 0)\n1\u2212 Pr(XI \u2212 Aw < 0)\n=\n\u222b\u221e\n0 FI(x+ y)dHw(y)\u2212\n\u222b\u221e\n0 FI(y)dHw(y)\n1\u2212 \u222b\u221e0 FI(y)dHw(y) (6)\nDenote hI(x) =\n1\n1\u2212GI(x)\ndGI(x)\ndx . Let t0 = td\u2212w. Then the probability\nof the event that no type II failure occurs within time interval\n(w, td) is G\u00afw(t0), where G\u00afw(t) = 1 \u2212 Gw(t). Then we have: (1)\nthe number of type I failures is G\u00afw(t0)\n\u222b t0\n0 hI(t)dt, given the event\nthat no type II failure occurs within time interval (w, td); and (2)\nthe number of type I failures is\n\u222b t0\n0 hI(t)dGw(t), given the event\nthat type II failures occur within time interval (w, td).\nThus, the expected cost on minimal repairs for type I failures\nafter the extended warranty period expires is given by\nE[CI] = cIG\u00afw(t0)\nt0\u222b\n0\nhI(t)dt+ cI\nt0\u222b\n0\nhI(t)dGw(t) (7)\n8\nSimilarly, the expected replacement costs incurred due to type II\nfailures after the extended warranty expires is\nE[CII] = cdG\u00afw(t0) + cIIGw(t0) = cd + (cII \u2212 cd)Gw(t0) (8)\nCf is the unavailability and liability cost incurred on a type I or\ntype II failures within the life cycle including both the warranty\nperiod the after warranty period. Then we have the following\nLemma.\nThe proofs of the Lemmas in this paper can be found in the\nAppendix.\nLemma 1 E[Cf ] is given by\nE[Cf ] = cfM(w)\nw\u222b\n0\nx\u222b\n0\nq(t)h(t)dtdFII(x)\n+ cf\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ed w\u222b\n0\ny\u222b\n0\nq(t)h(t)dtdHw(y) + G\u00afw(t0)\nt0\u222b\n0\nhI(t)dt+\nt0\u222b\n0\nhI(t)dGw(t)\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f8\n+ cf(1\u2212 FII(w))\nw\u222b\n0\nq(t)h(t)dt+ cf(M(w) +Gw(t0)) (9)\nIn sum, the expected LCC is therefore given by\nC(k, td) =C0 + Ce + E[CI] + E[CII] + E[Cf ]\n=C0 + kce + cd + (cII \u2212 cd)Gw(t0) + cf(M(w) +Gw(t0))\n+ (cI + cf)G\u00afw(t0)\nt0\u222b\n0\nhI(t)dt+ (cI + cf)\nt0\u222b\n0\nhI(t)dGw(t) + cf(1\u2212 FII(w))\nw\u222b\n0\nq(t)h(t)dt\n+ cfM(w)\nw\u222b\n0\nx\u222b\n0\nq(t)h(t)dtdFII(x) + cf\nw\u222b\n0\ny\u222b\n0\nq(t)h(t)dtdHw(y) (10)\nAfter the extended warranty expires, the equipment is replaced\nby a new identical one upon type II failure or at the fixed design\n9\nlife time td, whichever comes first. The replacement time length\nY will be Y (w) or t0 depending on whether the lifetime is shorter\nthan t0 or not. That is Y = min{Y (w), t0} =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nY (w) t \u2208 [0, t0)\nt0 t \u2208 [t0,\u221e)\n.\nThe expected length of a replacement cycle after the extended\nwarranty expires is given by\nE(Y ) =E[min{Y (w), t0}] =\nt0\u222b\n0\ntdGw(t) + t0(1\u2212Gw(td))\n=\nt0\u222b\n0\n(1\u2212Gw(t))dt =\nt0\u222b\n0\nG\u00afw(t)dt (11)\nThe expected length of a total life cycle span is given by\nB(k, td) = w +\nt0\u222b\n0\nG\u00afw(t)dt (12)\nLet D(k, td) signify the expected life cycle cost per unit time,\nthen we have\nD(k, td) =\nC(k, td)\nB(k, td)\n(13)\n4 Discussion\nThe cost cd of replacement at time td is assumed to be a con-\nstant value in the above discussion. However, cd might depend\non td\u2212SNw , which is the equipment age. If the replacement after\nthe extended warranty expires because the equipment reaches its\ndesign lifetime td, but not due to type II failure, the equipment\ncan be re-sold. Thus, the re-sale price might depend on the equip-\nment age, which is td \u2212 SNw . Discussion on assessing resale price\nor salvage price in reliability and maintenance can be found in\nMonga and Zuo (2001).\n10\nIn the preceding sections, repair upon type I failures is assumed\nto be minimal repair and time on repair is negligible. Obviously,\nrepair effects can be other types, for example, imperfect repair\n(see Wu and Clements-Croome (2005), for example) can be con-\nsidered.\nFor the expected life cycle cost per unit time given in Eq. (13),\nthe following special cases are also worthwhile mentioning.\n4.1 Special cases\nCase 1. If q(t) = 1, then the maintenance policy discussed in the\npreceding section is a classical periodic preventive replacement\npolicy with minimal repair upon failure. In this case, we have\nFII(t) = 0,Nw = 0, SNW = 0,M(w) = 0,Hw(t) = 0,Gw(t) = 0,\nGI(x) =\nFI(x+w)\u2212FI(w)\n1\u2212FI(w) , and hI(x) = h(x + w). Then C(k, td) =\nC0 +kce+ cd+ cI\n\u222b td\nw h(t)dt+ cf\n\u222b td\n0 h(t)dt and B(k, td) = td. The\nexpected life cycle cost per unit time is therefore given by\nD(k, td) =\nC(k, td)\nB(k, td)\n=\nC0 + kce + cd + cI\n\u222b td\nw h(t)dt+ cf\n\u222b td\n0 h(t)dt\ntd\n(14)\nCase 2. If q(t) = 0, then the maintenance policy discussed\nin the preceding section is a classical age-based replacement\npolicy. In this case, we have FI(t) = 0, and hI(t) = 0. The\nexpected life cycle cost per unit time is therefore given by\nD(k, td) =\nC0 + kce + cd + (cII \u2212 cd)Gw(t0) + cf(M(w) +Gw(t0))\nw +\n\u222b t0\n0 G\u00afw(t)dt\n(15)\nCase 3. Assume q(t) = q0 (where q0 \u2208 [0, 1]) and h(t) = \u03bb.\nThen, FI(x) = 1 \u2212 e\u2212q0\u03bbx, FII(x) = Hw(x) = Gw(x) = 1 \u2212\ne\u2212(1\u2212q0)\u03bbx, M(t) = (1 \u2212 q0)\u03bbt, and hI(x) = q0\u03bb. Denote C1 =\ncII + cf \u2212 cd + (cI + cf)q0\u03bb and \u03c8(k) = C0 + C1 + kce + cd +\ncf(\u03bbw+\nq0\n1\u2212q0 )\u2212cfq0\n(\n(1\u2212 q0)\u03bb2w2 + \u03bbw + 11\u2212q0\n)\ne\u2212(1\u2212q0)\u03bbw, then\nwe have\nC(k, td) = \u03c8(k) + (cI + cf)q0\u03bbt0G\u00afw(t0)\u2212 C1G\u00afw(t0) (16)\n11\nand\nB(k, td) = w +\n1\n(1\u2212 q0)\u03bb \u2212\n1\n(1\u2212 q0)\u03bbG\u00afw(t0) (17)\nThe parameter setting in Case 3 is widely adopted in practice\nbecause most industries assume constant failure rates of their\nequipment.\nCase 4 It is natural in commercial industries that the cost of\nreplacement could be dependent on design time and the age of\nproduct. As such, costs, including cf , cI, cII and cd in Eqs. (10)\nand (12), can be extended to be time-depended.\nOther cases If t0 = 0, then the warranty covers the whole\nlife time until the design life td is reached. If k = 0, then no\nextended warranty is purchased. In this case, we also have w =\nw0.\n4.2 Optimal policy for the special cases\nIn this section, we seek to optimise a combination of k and td\nthat minimises A(k, td).\nIf we substitute the numerator and the denominator of Eq. (13)\nwith C(k, td) from Eq. (10) and B(k, td) from Eq. (12), respec-\ntively, we may find that the expression is very complex. In prac-\ntice, if L = 1 (year), the value k has only several possible values,\nfor example, k = 1, 2, ...10. We can therefore fix the maximum\nvalue k = kmax, and optimise B(k0, td), as shown in Table 1.\nIn practice, given a fixed time period L, the number k0 of the\nextended warranty periods has only limited possibilities. The de-\nsign life td might also have a limited number of solutions, it can\nbe easy to obtain the optimal solutions based on Table 1. For\nexample, given L=6 months, then k0 might smaller than 100 and\ntd might not exceed 600 months.\nBased on the above discussions, for special cases, we can prove\nthe existence of the optimal solutions as follows.\n12\nTable 1\nOptimal solution (k\u2217, t\u2217d)\nInputs: h(t), q(t), w0, L, cI, cII, cd, cf , ce, kmax; Outputs: k\n\u2217, t\u2217d\n1: for k0 \u2208 {1, ..., kmax} do\n2: compute FII as defined by FII(z)\n3: compute Hw(y) and Gw(y) as defined by Eq. (4) and Eq. (5), respectively\n4: compute C(k, td) and B(k, td) defined by Eq. (10) and Eq. (12), respectively\n5: find the optimal T \u2217k0 to minimiseD(k0, td) defined by Eq. (13), where w+kL < td\n6: end\n7: let T \u2217km = min{T \u2217k0 , ..., T \u2217kmax}, t\u2217d = T \u2217km , and k\u2217 = km\nLemma 2 For a fixed k = k0, if q(t) = 1,\n(cI + cf)h(w)w \u2212 C0 \u2212 kce \u2212 cd \u2212 cf\nw\u222b\n0\nh(t)dt < 0, (18)\nand h(t) is a non-decreasing positive function, then there exists\none solution t\u2217d that minimises the life cycle average cost in Eq.\n(14).\nLemma 3 For a fixed k = k0, if q(t) = 0, cII \u2212 cd + cf > 0, and\ngw(0)(cII \u2212 cd + cf)w \u2212 (C0 + k0ce + cd + cfM(w)) < 0 (19)\nwhere gw(0) =\ndGw(td\u2212w)\ndtd\n|td=w, then there exists one solution t\u2217d\nwhich minimises the life cycle average cost in Eq. (15).\nLemma 4 For a fixed k = k0, the optimal design time td is given\nby\ntd \u2248 \u2212\u03b22 +\n\u221a\n\u03b222 \u2212 4\u03b21\u03b23\n2\u03b21\n+ w (20)\nwhere \u03b21 =\n1\n2(cI+cf)(1\u2212q0)q0\u03bb2, \u03b22 = \u2212(cI+cf)q0\u03bb+(cI+cf)[1+\n(1\u2212 q0)\u03bbw]q0\u03bb, \u03b23 = \u2212(cI + cf)q0\u03bbw\u2212C1(1\u2212 q0)\u03bbw\u2212C1\u2212\u03c8(k0).\n13\nTable 2\nParameter setting\nw0 L c0 ce cd cI cII cf \u03b1 \u03b3\n3.6 1.2 0 5 150 40 100 70 30 2\nTable 3\nOptimisation of the design time td.\ntd 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\nD(k, td) 25.07 22.66 21.03 19.96 19.30 18.96 18.88 19.00 19.29 19.74\ntd 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26\nD(k, td) 20.30 20.98 21.74 22.59 23.51 24.49 25.53 26.60 27.72 28.88\n5 Numerical experiments\nIn optimising the above problems, we need to approximate the\nrenewal function given in Eq. (3). Here, we use the approached\ndeveloped by Xie (1989) for approximating renewal functions. As-\nsume the failure time distribution of the equipment under study is\nWeibull distribution, i.e., h(t) = \u03b3\u03b1(\nt\n\u03b1)\n\u03b3\u22121, where \u03b3 > 1. Without\nloss of generality, we assume q(t) is constant.\nThe parameters in Table 2 are typical examples. In practice, the\nparameters set in Case 3 might be used as most industries set\nthe failure rates as constant.\n5.1 Optimisation of the design life when w is fixed\nSet parameters as shown in Table 2 and q(t) = 0.98. Let k0 = 2,\nwhich implies that the length k0 of the extended warranty is fixed\nand only the design lifetime td will be optimised. In this case, if\nwe use the algorithm listed in Table 1, we can find when td = 13,\nD(k, td) reaches its minimum value 18.88. See Table 3 for details.\n14\nTable 4\nOptimisation of k0 and td.\nk0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\ntd 8.6 9.8 11.0 12.2 13.4 14.6 15.8 17.0 18.2\nD(k, td) 21.46 20.17 19.30 18.71 18.31 18.05 17.88 17.79 17.74\nk0 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\ntd 19.4 20.6 21.8 23.0 24.2 25.4 26.6 27.8\nD(k, td) 17.73 17.74 17.76 17.78 17.81 17.83 17.84 17.86\n5.2 Optimisation of the length of the warranty period and the design life\nSet parameters as shown in Table 2, and q(t) = 0.98. We are\ntrying to optimise both the length of warranty period and the\ndesign life. If we use the algorithm listed in Table 1, we can find\nwhen td = 19.4 and k0 = 9, D(k, td) reaches the optimum value\nof 17.73. See Table 4 for details.\n5.3 Parameter q(t)\nIf q(t) changes, and we optimise td but keep k0 constant, it is\nfound that the optimal td remains unchanged. For example, if we\nset parameters as shown in Table 2, set k0 = 1, and change q(t)\nfrom 0.02 to 0.5 with step 0.02, it is found that the optimal value\nof td = 12.80 and it remains changed .\n6 Conclusions\nThere is an increasing trend of encouraging consumers to buy ex-\ntended warranty contracts. As both the length of warranty period\nand time to replacement influence the life cycle cost of equipment,\nselection of the extended warranty period and replacement poli-\ncies is therefore important from a consumer\u2019s perspective.\nIn practice, a piece of equipment is usually repaired after a minor\n15\nfailure occurs; and it is replaced by a new identical one after a\ncatastrophic failure occurs. This paper formulated the expected\nlife cycle cost considering policies for an extended warranty and\nmaintenance that are: opportunity-based age replacement policy\nwith minimal repair. Conditions for the existence of optimal so-\nlutions for both the length of the extended warranty period and\nthe design life for special cases are offered and proved.\nAcknowledgment\nI am grateful to the three anonymous referees for their valuable\ncomments and suggestions that improved the quality of this pa-\nper.

(19), L2(k0, w) < 0; and\n\u2022 L2(k0,\u221e) = (cII \u2212 cd + cf)gw(\u221e)(w + \u222b\u221e0 (1\u2212Gw(t))dt) > 0.\nHence there is one value w < t\u2217d < \u221e that satisfies Eq. (24),\nwhich minimises the life cycle average cost in Eq. (15).\nProof of Lemma 4. To find the optimal solution t\u2217d that min-\nimisesD(k, td) =\nC(k,td)\nB(k,td)\n, where C(k, td) andD(k, td) are from Eqs.\n(16) and (17), respectively. We set dD(k,td)dtd = 0, which results in\n(cI + cf)q0\n1\u2212 q0 G\u00afw(t0) + (\u03b22 + (cI + cf)q0\u03bb)t0 + \u03b23 +\n(cI + cf)q0\n1\u2212 q0 = 0.(25)\nUsing the second order Taylor expansion of G\u00af(t0) at t0 = 0, we\ncan have\n\u03b21t\n2\n0 + \u03b22t0 + \u03b23 = 0. (26)\nSolve Eq. (26) and consider t0 = td\u2212w, we can obtain the solution\nin Eq. (20).\n20\n"}
