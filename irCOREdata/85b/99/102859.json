INTRODUCTION \nNIVERSAL Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) is \ncurrently being deployed and optimised as new services \nand features are being incorporated. It is necessary to be \nequipped with accurate air-interface (link-level) and system-\nlevel simulators to help in the optimisation process. The link-\nlevel simulator provides inputs to the system-level simulator, \nbased on which various performance metrics such as \nthroughput, delay, etc. can be optimised. Some of the \ntechniques that are usually modelled at the system-level such \nas soft handover (SHO) can also be modelled at the link-level. \nSHO is one of the most important functionalities of radio \nresource management in CDMA based mobile cellular \nsystems. It is used in the intra-frequency handover and allows \nmobile stations to be connected simultaneously to several base \nstations, which are selected by a pre-defined SHO algorithm. \nSHO provides spatial diversity in both the uplink and the \ndownlink, leading to improvements in quality of service. \nProper design and tuning of SHO is one of the main \nchallenges in UMTS, as it has great impact on the trade-offs \nbetween coverage, system capacity and service quality in the \nnetwork. \nThe impact of SHO is usually investigated through system-\nlevel simulations. However, at the system-level, multipath \nfading is not usually considered, as the pilot channel samples \ntaken for handover purpose are measured on a fairly slow \nbasis and are averaged so as to reduce the number of \nhandovers. Moreover, the use of maximum ratio combining \n(MRC) in the downlink for SHO users implies that the Rake \nreceiver has an unlimited number of fingers and hence all the \nmultipaths from the base stations involved, can fully \ncontribute to the signal diversity. This is inaccurate, as a \npractical Rake handset receiver has limited number of fingers \n[1].   \nLink-level research on diversity performance, to some \nextent could rectify these inaccuracies. Realistic multipath \nchannels corresponding to more than one Node-B that are in a \nhandover along with power margin, correctly defined other \nusers\u2019 interference and detailed transceiver models can \novercome the inaccuracies of SHO performance obtained at \nsystem-level. Yet there cannot be found in the literature a \ncomprehensive set of link-level results regarding SHO, softer \nhandover (SerHO) and hard handover (HHO) performance, \nparticularly as a function of the multipath fading correlation \nbetween the links. This paper attempts to rectify the omission. \nWithin published literature, the authors in [2] compare the \nlink-level handover gain as a function of the relative path loss \nbetween the two Node-Bs, but they model the interference as \nGaussian noise, which is a reasonable assumption only for the \nother-cell interference (caused by distant base stations) and \nnot for the downlink intra-cell interference as well as the \ninterference caused by the adjacent handover cell. In [3], link-\nlevel handover results are presented for four different services \nin 3GPP Case 3 radio channel but they consider only \nuncorrelated links with a fixed power margin.  \nIn this paper, we evaluate the performance of SHO and \ncompare it with that of HHO and no handover (that models a \nsingle cell) for a range of geometry factors (defined as ratio of \npower received from the serving cell to that from surrounding \ncells plus the thermal noise) and establish the range of \nimportant design parameters that influence the system \ncapacity. The paper is organized as follows: the system model \nis introduced in section II and the handover performance in \nsection III for a range of geometry factors for a macro as well \nas a micro cell. Section IV illustrates the impact of various \nother factors that influence the downlink handover \nperformance. Finally, conclusions are drawn in section V. \nLink-Level Analysis of Downlink Handover \nRegions in UMTS  \nAtta Ul Quddus, Xinjie Yang and Rahim Tafazolli, Member, IEEE\nU\n978-1-4244-1645-5\/08\/$25.00  \u00a92008 IEEE 2527\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Two Node-Bs are modelled (having independent \ndedicated physical data channel DPDCH, common pilot \nchannel CPICH and orthogonal channel noise simulator \nOCNS that is a mechanism for modelling intra-cell users [4]) \nas well as the power margin (difference) between the two \nradio links, an important parameter that triggers the initiation \nof handover procedure. A desired correlation is introduced \nbetween the multipath radio channels from the two Node-Bs. \nIn this paper, we distinguish between SHO and SerHO based \non the correlation between the two links (higher correlation for \nSerHO and lower for SHO). In the Rake receiver, fingers are \nallocated for descrambling, despreading and channel \ncompensation of the signal from both the Node-Bs or only one \nof them, depending upon whether the UE is in SHO or not.    \nCPICH1\nDPCH1\nOCNS1\n+ Radio\nchannel1\n+\nCPICH2\nDPCH2\nOCNS2\n+ Radio\nchannel2\nChannel\ncorrelation +\nx\nPower\nmargin\nRake\nIoc = \u03c32oc+\n\u03c32BG\nScrmb\nCode2\nScrmb\nCode1\nFig. 1.  Concise block diagram of the links from two Node-Bs to one UE \nTypically, the multipath fading associated with the two \nradio links that are in a handover mode is assumed to be \nuncorrelated which is not always true particularly for SerHO \ndue to the co-location of two sectors of the Node-B. Due to the \ngeometry of the environment, there is a degree of correlation \neven for the multipath fading between the two radio links. \nThus it is important to model the multipath fading correlation \nas accurately as possible in order to have a true picture of the \ngains provided by handover. Herein, a method for generating a \ndesired number N of Rayleigh fading envelopes with any \ndesired covariance matrix, as presented in [5], is followed. \nThe simulation parameters are shown in Table 1 whose \nvalues are typical assumptions used for 3GPP simulations \n[3,4]. It should be noted that the 3GPP Case 1 is a 3 km\/h two-\ntap channel, representative of a typical urban micro-cell \nwhereas the 3GPP Case 3 is a 120 km\/h four-tap channel and \nrepresents the propagation characteristics of a fast moving \nvehicle in a macro-cell [4]. An example of simulator \nverification is shown in Fig. 2 where our results (marked as \nUniS) are compared to the results obtained by Nokia [3] for \nHHO and SHO and it can be seen that there is a very good \nmatch giving credibility to the results presented in the next \nsection.  \n\u221220 \u221219 \u221218 \u221217 \u221216 \u221215 \u221214\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\nTransmit Ec\/Ior [dB]\nBL\nER\nSHO UniS\nSHO Nokia\nHHO UniS\nHHO Nokia\nFig. 2.

Performance in Case 3 Radio Channel with Correlation 0 \nIt is interesting to note that in Fig. 3, the performance of \nSHO becomes worse when compared to NHO for geometry \nfactors greater than or equal to 6 dB. A similar trend is seen in \nFig. 4 where at a 6 dB geometry factor, NHO and SHO \nperform almost identical. The reason for this behaviour is that \nSHO experiences an interference floor as both the Node-Bs \ntransmit at full power and the scrambling codes are not \nperfectly orthogonal whereas NHO, which is essentially a \nsingle isolated cell, suffers only from the other cells \ninterference ( )ocI  and multipath induced interference but not \nfrom the interference experienced with the handover. As the \ngeometry factor increases (the other cell interference decreases \nas in ocor II \/\u02c6  the orI\u02c6  is fixed to unity), the rate of decrease in \norc IE \/  of SHO is much lower compared to that of NHO. This \ncan be observed in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 and is due to the fact that \nthe SHO suffers from a multi-access interference floor as \npointed out earlier and eventually the orc IE \/  of SHO \nbecomes worse than that of NHO.  The 6 dB threshold value at \nwhich this happens and causes SHO to suffer a loss in capacity \nwill help in the cell planning as the geometry factor provides a \nmeasure of cell isolation. \nSince, the multipath fading correlation reduces the signal \ncombining gain, it is expected that with increasing correlation, \nthe SHO orc IE \/  will become worse than that of NHO at \nlower values of geometry factor (i.e. higher levels of the other-\ncells interference). This is illustrated in Fig. 5 for the Case 1 \nradio channel and in Fig. 6 for the Case 3 radio channel at 1 % \nBLER and for a very high correlation value of 0.95. In reality, \nthe multipath fading correlation may not be as high as 0.95, \nnevertheless it represents the worst-case scenario. Fig. 5 and \nFig. 6 show that the value of the threshold indeed reduces to 2 \ndB in the Case 1 radio channel and to 0 dB in the Case 3 radio \nchannel, as expected. The threshold value of 0 dB of the \ngeometry factor can be used as a guideline for highly \ncorrelated environments. \n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\u221222\n\u221221\n\u221220\n\u221219\n\u221218\n\u221217\n\u221216\n\u221215\n\u221214\n\u221213\nGeometry Factor [dB]\nEc\n\/Io\nr [d\nB]\nNHO\nHHO\nSHO\nFig. 5.

FACTORS INFLUENCING HANDOVER PERFORMANCE \nIn this section, the influence on the handover performance \nby factors such as the power margin between the two Node-Bs \n(or two sectors of a Node-B), multipath fading correlation, \ninner loop power control step size (ILPC), limited number of \nRake fingers, channel estimation and STTD are investigated. \nNote that the SHO Gain in the following results is defined as \nthe difference of orc IE \/  values of HHO and SHO at a BLER \nof 1 %. All of the following results were obtained for a \ngeometry factor of 0 dB, a BLER of 1 % and using ideal \nchannel estimation unless otherwise specified. \nA. Impact of Correlation and Power Margin \nTable 2 summarizes the orc IE \/  values for the SHO and \nHHO at 1% BLER as a function of the multipath fading \ncorrelation between the two radio links in 3GPP Case 1 radio \nchannel with the power difference between the two Node-Bs \nequal to 0 dB and 3 dB, respectively. For these results, the \nCLPC was also switched-on. Since the handover is initiated \nonly when the power margin (or power difference) between \n2529\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

By increasing the correlation, the gain steadily reduces \nand at a correlation of 0.95, the gain has reduced by 1.94 dB, \ni.e. (5.16 \u2013 3.22 = 1.94). Moreover since the SerHO usually \nexperiences high values of correlation due to the co-location \nof the two sectors of a Node-B whereas SHO typically \nexperiences low or almost no correlation due to the physical \nseparation of the two Node-Bs, SerHO is expected to support \n28% ( )( )( )10\/49.1693.17101 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212=  less users than SHO. Table 2 \nalso shows that when the power margin between the two \nNode-Bs is 3 dB, SHO performs about 1 dB = (\u201316.95+17.93) \nworse as compared to 0 dB power margin, but the HHO \nperforms 1.53 dB = (\u201314.3+12.77) better than the HHO \nperformance with 0 dB power margin. This is logical since in \nHHO, the signal from the second Node-B is not combined and \nacts as an interferer, and the lower the interference power, the \nbetter the performance. Because of this, the SHO gain over the \nHHO also reduces significantly with the increasing power \nmargin, e.g. at correlation of 0 the SHO gain reduces from \n5.16 dB to 2.65 dB. Table 3 shows the impact of the \ncorrelation and the power margin on the HHO and the SHO \nperformance in the 3GPP Case 3 radio channel with CLPC \ndisabled. \nTABLE 3: CORRELATION AND POWER MARGIN IMPACT IN CASE 3 CHANNEL\nPower Margin = 0 dB Power Margin = 3 dB \nC\nor\nre\nla\ntio\nn \nSHO \norc IE \/\n[dB] \nHHO\norc IE \/\n[dB] \nGain \n[dB] \nSHO \norc IE \/\n[dB] \nHHO\norc IE \/\n[dB] \nGain \n[dB] \n0.00 \u2013 18.20 \u2013 14.55 3.65 \u2013 17.50 \u2013 15.60 1.90 \n0.20 \u2013 17.80 \u2013 14.30 3.50 \u2013 17.10 \u2013 15.45 1.65 \n0.40 \u2013 17.45 \u2013 14.05 3.40 \u2013 16.85 \u2013 15.35 1.50 \n0.60 \u2013 17.00 \u2013 13.85 3.15 \u2013 16.40 \u2013 15.20 1.20 \n0.80 \u2013 16.75 \u2013 13.85 2.90 \u2013 16.20 \u2013 15.20 1.00 \n0.95 \u2013 16.75 \u2013 13.85 2.90 \u2013 16.10 \u2013 15.20 0.90 \nA closer observation of Table 2 and Table 3 reveals that the \nperformance of both SHO and HHO is improved in the 3GPP \nCase 3 channel compared to the 3GPP Case1 channel due to \navailability of more multipath diversity and a greater degree of \ntime variations in the former. However, the improvements to \nSHO are less as compared to HHO, as SHO combining has \nalready taken advantages of channel diversity, leading to \nlower SHO gains in the 3GPP Case3 channel. Also in Case 3, \nthe relative performance loss of SerHO as compared to the \nSHO is similar to that in Case 1 radio channel, i.e. 28% \n( )( )( )10\/75.1620.18101 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212= , at a power margin of 0 dB. Thus \nthe multipath fading correlation affects the relative SHO \nperformance similarly in the two fading channels. \nB.

The correlation is \nassumed to be 0 for these results. \nTABLE 4: IMPACT OF ILPC STEP SIZE IN 3GPP CASE 1 RADIO CHANNEL\nPower Margin = 0 dB Power Margin = 3 dB \nStep \nSize \n[dB] \nSHO \norc IE \/\n[dB] \nHHO\norc IE \/\n[dB] \nGain \n[dB] \nSHO \norc IE \/\n[dB] \nHHO\norc IE \/\n[dB] \nGain \n[dB] \n0.50 \u2013 17.91 \u2013 11.91 6.00 \u2013 16.91 \u2013 13.44 3.47 \n1.00 \u2013 17.93 \u2013 12.77 5.16 \u2013 16.95 \u2013 14.30 2.65 \n2.00 \u2013 17.90 \u2013 13.05 4.85 \u2013 16.99 \u2013 14.41 2.58 \nIt is seen that SHO orc IE \/  does not vary much as the step-\nsize changes from 0.5 dB to 2 dB, whereas HHO orc IE \/\nimproves. This is due to the fact that for HHO a larger power \ncontrol step-size also helps overcome the interference caused \nby the signal from the second Node-B that acts as an interferer \nand is not used for signal combining. On the other hand, SHO, \ndue to signal combining from the two Node-Bs is seen to be \nrelatively independent of ILPC step-size in Case 1 channel. \nTABLE 5: IMPACT OF ILPC STEP SIZE IN 3GPP CASE 3 RADIO CHANNEL\nPower Margin = 0 dB Power Margin = 3 dB \nStep \nSize \n[dB] \nSHO \norc IE \/\n[dB] \nHHO\norc IE \/\n[dB] \nGain \n[dB] \nSHO \norc IE \/\n[dB] \nHHO\norc IE \/\n [dB] \nGain \n[dB] \n0.50 \u2013 17.11 \u2013 13.87 3.24 \u2013 16.57 \u2013 14.74 1.83 \n1.00 \u2013 17.18 \u2013 13.79 3.39 \u2013 16.70 \u2013 14.85 1.85 \n2.00 \u2013 16.99 \u2013 13.45 3.54 \u2013 16.34 \u2013 14.39 1.95 \nTable 5 shows the performance in the 3GPP Case 3 radio \nchannel and it can be seen that the SHO orc IE \/  shows an \noptimum step-size of 1 dB for a power margin of 0 dB as well \nas 3 dB.  The performance degrades at higher step sizes (e.g. 2 \ndB) due to the faster variations of the 120-km\/h radio channel. \nAgain, the HHO is seen to perform relatively better in the \nCase 3 than in the Case 1 radio channel.

Restrictions apply. \nTable 5 and Table 3 that in the Case 3 radio channel, by \nenabling the CLPC, the SHO performs worse ( orc IE \/ = \u2013\n17.18 dB) at a step-size of 1 dB as compared to the SHO with \nCLPC disabled ( orc IE \/ = \u201318.20 dB). Thus at high speeds, \nthe CLPC should not be used, at least from the perspective of \nSHO. \nC. Impact of Channel Estimation \nSince, channel estimation (CHEST) is more challenging at \nhigh speeds, we present the impact of CHEST through the \nCPICH only in the 3GPP Case 3 radio channel having 120 \nkm\/h mobile velocity. Table 6 illustrates the impact of CHEST \non the orc IE \/  of NHO, HHO and SHO at 1% BLER, 0 \ncorrelation and the power margin equal to 0 dB. It is observed \nthat estimating the channel through CPICH incurs a loss in \norc IE \/  of about 0.3 \u2013 0.5 dB. Note that the channel \nestimation method that has been used in the simulations is a \nsimple pilot averaging method. With more sophisticated \nmethods, the 11 % ( )10\/5.0101 \u2212\u2212=  loss in capacity of SHO can \nbe reduced still further. \nTABLE 6: IMPACT OF CHEST IN 3GPP CASE 3 CHANNEL WITH CLPC OFF\norc IE \/  [dB] Ideal CHEST \nThrough \nCPICH  Loss [dB] \nNHO  \u2013 16.85 \u2013 16.50 0.35 \nHHO    \u2013 14.55 \u2013 14.10 0.45 \nSHO   \u2013 18.20 \u2013 17.70 0.50 \nD. Impact of the Number of Rake Fingers \nA typical Rake receiver in a UE has four to six Rake \nfingers. Since, for SHO in the 3GPP Case3 channel, the total \nnumber of multipaths is 8, the impact of limited number of \nRake fingers is shown in Table 7 by assuming a correlation of \n0 between the two links and CLPC switched off. \nTABLE 7: IMPACT OF NO. OF RAKE FINGERS IN CASE 3 CHANNEL \nPower Margin = 0 dB Power Margin = 3 dB \nNo. of Fingers \nSHO orc IE \/  [dB] SHO orc IE \/  [dB] \n8 \u2013 18.20 \u2013 17.50 \n6 \u2013 18.10 \u2013 17.40 \n4 \u2013 17.90 \u2013 17.30 \nNote that for these results, the fingers are allocated to the \npaths having the highest power in descending order. Due to \nthis finger allocation mechanism, with 4 Rake fingers, the \norc IE \/  of SHO suffers at most by 0.3 dB = (\u201317.90 + 18.20), \ni.e. a loss of 7 % ( )10\/3.0101 \u2212\u2212=  in capacity, in the 3GPP \nCase 3 channel, when the power margin is 0 dB. \nE. Impact of STTD \nThe impact of STTD on the SHO performance is illustrated in \nTable 8 for 3GPP Case 1 radio channel with CLPC enabled \nand a correlation value of 0. Note that in Table 8, the STTD \ngain is the gain provided by STTD in SHO and not the gain \nprovided by SHO over the HHO performance. It is seen that \nthe relative gain provided by STTD in SHO is around 0.5 dB. \nIn [6], it is reported that STTD provides a gain of 0.8 dB in a \ntypical micro-cell without taking into account handover, thus \nthe 0.3 dB reduction (0.8 \u2013 0.5) in the STTD gain in SHO \nseems logical as the SHO already provides a degree of \ndiversity and the additional diversity gain provided by STTD \nis expected to be somewhat less. \nTABLE 8: IMPACT OF STTD IN 3GPP CASE 1 CHANNEL WITH CLPC ON\nSHO  orc IE \/  [dB] Power \nMargin \n[dB] With STTD Without STTD \nSTTD Gain \n[dB] \n0 \u2013 18.46 \u2013 17.93 0.53 \n3 \u2013 17.42 \u2013 16.95 0.47 \nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, the performance of (soft\/softer\/hard) handover \nin WCDMA based UMTS FDD downlink is analysed at the \nlink-level in 3GPP Case 1 and 3GPP Case 3 radio channels. It \nis shown that there is a trade-off between the signal combining \ngain provided by the handover, the multi-access interference \nassociated with the handover and the other cells interference. \nThreshold values of the geometry factor are established \nbeyond which the performance of SHO becomes worse than \nthat of a single isolated cell. Factors influencing the handover \nperformance such as the multipath fading correlation, power \ncontrol step-size, channel estimation as well as transmit \nantenna diversity, are investigated and their impact on the \nhandover is illustrated in terms of the average transmit power. \nThese link-level results will help in the system-level analysis \nand provide guidelines for UMTS network dimensioning. \nREFERENCES\n[1] A.
