Introduction\nThe cell-cycle is the set of events whereby a cell\nduplicates most of its components, including its\nchromosomes, in order to undergo division (Alberts\net al., 1994). The cell-cycle is usually divided into four\nphases: G1; S, G2; and M. In G1 (G=gap), the cell is not\ncommitted to division and the chromosomes do not\nreplicate. Replication of nuclear DNA occurs during the\nS phase, whereas completion of mitosis occurs in the\nfinal M phase. The interval between DNA replicationwas generated using the Academic Press \u2018generic\u2019\ne.\ning author.\nesses: t.alarcon@cs.ucl.ac.uk, alarcon@maths.ox.ac.uk\nress: Bioinformatics Unit, Department of Computer\nrsity College London, Gower Street, London WC1E\ne front matter r 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The first\nof these transitions occurs at the end of G1 and is called\n\u2018\u2018Start\u2019\u2019 (see Fig. 1 for a schematic representation).\nDuring G1 the cell monitors its environment and size.\nWhen the external conditions and the size of the cell are\nsuitable, the cell commits itself to DNA synthesis and\ndivision. This transition is irreversible: once the cell\nenters the S phase and DNA replication commences,\ndivision has to be completed. The second transition,\n\u2018\u2018Finish\u2019\u2019,2 occurs when DNA replication is completed.\nOnce the cell has checked that DNA and chromatide\nalignment have occurred, the Finish transition is\ntriggered and the cell finally divides into two daughter\ncells. A fifth state, the so-called G0 state, is defined to2We have adopted the nomenclature used by Tyson and Novak\n(2001).\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nCdh1\u2013APC\nCyc\u2013CDK\nG 1 G 2R -MS-\ntime\nFig. 1.

The dotted (vertical) line\nrepresents the restriction point (R) at which the \u2018\u2018Start\u2019\u2019 transition\noccurs. Before the cell goes through this transition, it is in the G1 stage.\nAfter the \u2018\u2018Start\u2019\u2019 transition the cell enters the S phase in which DNA\nsynthesis takes place.

Alarc !on et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 229 (2004) 395\u2013411396refer to cells that have abandoned normal progression\nthrough the cell-cycle and become quiescent. In this\nstate most (although not all) of the cell functions are\nsuspended, most notably, proliferation\nThe events occurring during the cell-cycle are\ncontrolled by a series of molecular signals. The central\ncomponents of this network are two families of proteins:\nthe cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and the cyclins\n(Funk, 1999). The CDKs induce downstream processes\nby phosphorylating selected proteins. However, to do\nthis, they must be activated by binding to the cyclins.\nCyclins are so-called because they undergo a cycle of\nsynthesis and degradation parallel to the cell division\ncycle. The CDK network is very complex, so that for\nour modelling purposes we will take into account only\nits essential features (Tyson and Novak, 2001).\nDuring G1; CDK activity is low because the relevant\ncyclin partners are missing: their production is inhibited\nand they are rapidly degraded. At \u2018\u2018Start\u2019\u2019 cyclin\nsynthesis is promoted, and hence the CDKs are\nactivated. CDK activity remains high during S, G2;\nand M, since it is necessary for DNA replication and\nother processes occurring during the final stages of the\ncycle. At \u2018\u2018Finish\u2019\u2019, the anaphase protein complex (APC)\nis activated. APC marks specific target proteins (such as\ncyclins) for degradation by the proteolytic machinery of\nthe cell and is composed of a dozen polypeptides and\ntwo auxiliary proteins (Cdc20 and Cdh1). When active,\nthese two proteins present the target proteins to the core\nof the complex for labelling. Together, they label cyclins\nfor destruction at the end of the cycle, allowing the\ncontrol system to return to G1: The cyclin-CDKcomplexes control Cdc20 and Cdh1 activity differently:\nwhilst cyclin-CDK activates Cdc20, it inhibits Cdh1.\nThe dynamics of the cell-cycle can be affected by\nenvironmental conditions, in particular, by the level of\nextracellular oxygen: it is well documented that low\noxygen concentrations (hypoxia) alter progression\nthrough the cell division cycle (Gardner et al., 2001),\nand the G1=S transition, in particular. The response of\nthis transition to hypoxia is mediated by the protein p27,\nan element of the CDK network whose production is\nupregulated under hypoxia (Funk, 1999; Gardner et al.,\n2001). p27 mediates hypoxia-induced arrest of the G1=S\ntransition by inhibiting Cyc-CDK complex formation\nand, thereby, inhibiting DNA synthesis.\nHypoxia is a major factor in the evolution of solid\ntumours. During the avascular phase of tumour growth,\ncells located in hypoxic regions secrete and release\nangiogenic factors, thus triggering vascularization of the\ntumour. In vascularized tumours, hypoxia also plays an\nimportant role. Vascular tumours have a heterogeneous\ncomposition which may vary over time. For example,\ncancer cells close to blood vessels proliferate rapidly in\nthe presence of abundant nutrients. Cancer vessels are in\ngeneral immature (they lack muscular tone) and tend to\ncollapse under the increasing pressure produced by the\n(unbalanced) tumour cell proliferation. These cells then\nbecome hypoxic thereby stimulating a vascular re-\nsponse. In this way, hypoxia contributes to dynamical\nchanges in tumour structure. As we have mentioned\nabove, hypoxia also modulates the rate of progression\nthrough the cell-cycle.\nThe cell-cycles of normal and cancer cells exhibit\nremarkable differences (Funk, 1999), one of the most\nimportant being how they respond to hypoxia: whereas\nmost normal cells undergo apoptosis when the hypoxic\nstress is too intense or persists for too long, cancer cells\nappear to have a much higher resistance to hypoxia.\nThis resistance is (in part) due to their ability to enter\ninto a quiescent state under severe or prolonged hypoxic\nstress (Royds et al., 1998). Of course, if the levels of\noxygen become extremely low or hypoxia persists for a\nlong time, the cancer cells eventually die.\nAlthough the role played by p27 in both normal and\ncancer cells is the same, there are some differences\nbetween the respective patterns of p27 expression. For\nexample the concentration of p27 is, generally, smaller\nin cancer cells than in normal cells (Bai et al., 2001;\nFunk, 1999; Philipp-Staheli et al., 2001). It has also been\nobserved that normal cells in the presence of growth\nfactors exhibit reduced levels of p27 expression (Leshem\nand Halevy, 2002; Saito et al., 2001). In spite of these\ndifferences, mutations in the chromosome encoding for\np27 are rarely found in human cancer (Funk, 1999).\nHence, it is likely that the different behaviour of p27 in\nnormal and cancer cells is produced by different\nregulatory mechanisms.\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nT. Alarc !on et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 229 (2004) 395\u2013411 397The aim of this paper is to develop a model that\nreproduces the different responses of normal and cancer\ncells to hypoxic stress, and, in particular, the ability of\ncancer cells to enter a quiescent state when oxygen levels\nfall very low. We also aim to explain why the patterns of\np27 expression observed in normal and cancer cells vary.\nRelated theoretical work on the effects of hypoxia on\nthe behaviour of tumour cells has focused on the role of\nthe tumour suppressor gene p53. Experimental observa-\ntions indicate that in a hypoxic environment cancer cells\ncarrying a mutant version of the gene p53 have a\nsurvival advantage over their wild-type counterparts,\nThis is because mutant cells are less susceptible to\nhypoxia-induced apoptosis than wild-type cells (Thom-\nson and Royds, 1999). Mathematical models quantify-\ning this survival advantage under repeated rounds of\nhypoxia have been proposed by Thomson and Royds\n(1999) and Gammack et al. (2001) for in vitro and in vivo\nsystems, respectively.\nAs a basic mathematical model for the cell-cycle we\nuse the one developed by Tyson and Novak (2001). A\nfull analysis of this model can be found in Tyson and\nNovak (2001), so here we only summarize its main\nfeatures.\nTyson and Novak (2001) claim that regulation of the\ncell-cycle, i.e. the irreversible transitions \u2018\u2018Start\u2019\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2018Finish\u2019\u2019, is a consequence of the creation and destruc-\ntion of stable steady states of the molecular regulatory\nsystem of the cell division process. In other words, the\ncore of the cell-cycle is a biological switch (Cherry and\nAdler, 2000). The set of ordinary differential equations\nthat Tyson and Novak (2001) introduce to model the\nStart transition is the following:\ndx\ndt\n\u00bc\n\u00f0k03 \u00fe k\n00\n3A\u00de\u00f01\u0006 x\u00de\nJ3 \u00fe 1\u0006 x\n\u0006\nk4myx\nJ4 \u00fe x\n; \u00f01\u00de\ndy\ndt\n\u00bc k1 \u0006 \u00f0k02 \u00fe k\n00\n2x\u00dey; \u00f02\u00de\ndm\ndt\n\u00bc mm 1\u0006\nm\nm\u0001\n\u0001 \u0002\n; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere x \u0007 \u00bdCdh1\t represents the concentration of active\nCdh1\/APC complexes, y \u0007 \u00bdCyc\t; the concentration of\ncyclin-CDK complexes,3 and m is the mass of the cell.\nThe ki\u2019s \u00f0i \u00bc 1; 2; 3; 4\u00de are rate constants and the Ji\u2019s\n\u00f0i \u00bc 3; 4\u00de are Michaelis\u2013Menten constants. In Eq. (1), A\nrepresents a generic activator. Tyson and Novak (2001)\nscale their equations so that the total concentration of\nCdh1 (active plus inactive) is normalized to 1 and the\nMichaelis\u2013Menten constants J3 and J4 are much smaller\nthan 1. This condition ensures that the model exhibits3 In Tyson and Novak (2001), [Cyc] corresponds to the concentra-\ntion of the specific complex cyclinB-CDK. Here we simply consider a\ngeneric cyclin-CDK complex in order to keep our model as simple as\npossible.switching behaviour as in Fig. 1 (Cherry and Adler,\n2000). In Eq. (3), m is the cell growth rate and m\u0001 is the\nmass of an adult cell.\nEqs. (1)\u2013(3) have been used to model the control that\na cell carries out on its size before entering the Start\ntransition (Alberts et al., 1994). This control is\nincorporated in Eq. (1) through the dependence on the\nmass of the inactivation term for Cdh1 (see Tyson and\nNovak (2001) for details).\nThe model we develop in this paper involves modify-\ning Eqs. (1)\u2013(3) to include the effects of oxygen tension\nand p27 levels on the cell-cycle. In particular we assume\nthat p27, whose production is stimulated by hypoxia,\nwill inhibit the formation of Cyc-CDK complexes.\nNotice that Eqs. (1)\u2013(3) do not constitute a model for\nthe whole cell-cycle; they only account for the G1=S\ntransition. In Tyson and Novak (2001), three additional\nequations are added to this model in order to account\nfor the latter events that lead to mitosis. However, from\nTyson and Novak (2001), we can see that the machinery\nthat finishes the cell-cycle is basically triggered when\n[Cdh1] is below a threshold value and [Cyc] is above\nanother threshold value. Hence, in order to keep our\nmodel as simple as possible, and since the phenomena\nwe are interested in are closely related to the behaviour\nof G1=S; we make the simplifying assumption that the\ncell-cycle is finished when x \u00bc \u00bdCdh1\toxTHR and y \u00bc\n\u00bdCyc\t > yTHR: When this condition is fulfilled the control\nsystem is reset (see next section).\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows.\nIn Section 2, we present the experimental results on\nwhich our model for normal cells is based (Section 2.1)\nand formulate the corresponding mathematical model\n(Section 2.2). We then show how to modify the model to\ndescribe cancer cells (Section 2.3). In Section 3, the two\nmodels are solved numerically and we verify that our\nmodel captures the features observed experimentally. In\nSection 4, we analyse the phase plane and the fixed\npoints of both models in order to give some insight into\nthe mechanisms responsible for the different qualitative\nbehaviour of normal and cancer cells. Finally, Section 5\ncontains a summary of our results together with our\nconclusions.2. Model development\nCell division in both cancer and normal cells is\ninfluenced by a range of stimuli. For example, following\nprolonged periods of overcrowding and\/or nutrient\ndeprivation, the cell-cycle is arrested and cells undergo\napoptosis (Alberts et al., 1994). One environmental\nstress that is known to affect cell division is hypoxia (see\nCarmeliet et al. (1998) and Gardner et al. (2001)). Our\naim in this section is to develop simple models for the\ncontrol of the cell-cycle in normal and cancer cells which\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nT. Alarc !on et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 229 (2004) 395\u2013411398qualitatively account for experimental observations that\nindicate their response to hypoxia.\n2.1. Experimental background: normal cells\nIn experiments carried out on mouse embryo fibro-\nblasts (MEFs) Gardner et al. (2001) found that hypoxia\ninduces G1 arrest and that this is associated with\nchanges in G1 regulators. Reduction of retinoblastoma\n(RB) phosphorylation was observed but no decrease in\nCDK2 concentration was observed, suggesting that\nsome of the CDKs activity modifiers were affected by\nhypoxia. They also found that, of all the regulators of\nCDK2 activity, only cyclinE and p27 were appreciably\naffected by hypoxia. To establish further the role of p27,\np27 null MEFs were rendered hypoxic. No changes in\nthe cell-cycle profile or in DNA duplication indexes were\nobserved, indicating that p27 may be necessary for\nhypoxia-induced G1 arrest. As Gardner et al. (2001)\nremarked, an increase in p27 may be a secondary effect\nof growth arrest, rather than a mediator of hypoxia-\ninduced G1 arrest. However, p27 expression is also\nincreased in null RB MEFs that are cycling under\nhypoxia, implying that an increase in p27 expression is a\nconsequence of hypoxia, rather than a side effect of RB\nhypophosphorylation during cell-cycle arrest.\nIn addition to these observations, there is independent\nexperimental evidence that cyclinA and cyclinE are\ntargets of the E2F transcription factor (DeGregori et al.,\n1995) and are directly inhibited by hypophosporylated\nRB (Knudsen et al., 1999). Gardner et al. (2001)\nsummarized these findings by constructing a schematic\ndiagram of hypoxia-induced G1 arrest (see Fig. 3(a)).\nHere hypoxia leads to overexpression of the CDK\ninhibitor p27, which downregulates the activity of the\ncyclin-CDK complexes. This, in turn, prevents the\nnormal progression of the cell through the Start\ntransition.Cdh1\u2013APC\nCyc\u2013CDK\nCdh1\u2013APC\nCyc\u2013CDK\nHYPOXIA INDUCEHIGH OXYGEN CONCENTRATION\ntime time(A) (B)\nFig. 2.

Both terms are\nused widely in the literature often with slightly different\nmeanings. Therefore to prevent any potential misunder-\nstanding, we now explain how we interpret cell\nquiescence and arrest. A cell will be said to be in the\nquiescent state when its progress through the cell-cycle\nhas been halted, i.e. when the cell is in G0: Arrest will\nrefer to a situation in which progress through the cell-\ncycle has been delayed but the cell does not enter G0 (see\nFig. 2). Both arrest and quiescence can be induced by\nhypoxia (low oxygen tension). Our model will allow us\nto make more precise these definitions. As we show in\nSection 4 this transition is related to the existence of a\nbifurcation in the CDK network control system. More\nspecifically, from the dynamical point of view, hypoxia-\ninduced arrest occurs when this bifurcation is delayed\nwhereas hypoxia-induced quiescence occurs when no\nsuch bifurcation exists.\nIt is important to note that in Gardner et al.\u2019s\nexperiments with normal cells no fraction of the\npopulation was found in G0; implying that fibroblasts\ndo not appear to exhibit hypoxia-induced quiescence.\nHence, we will assume that all normal cells\nbehave similarly, i.e. they exhibit hypoxia-induced\narrest (i.e. delay) of the G1=S transition, but not\nquiescence. If the hypoxic stress is prolonged or becomes\ntoo intense, normal cells may undergo apoptosis,\nusually through the p53 pathway (Kinzler and Vogel-\nstein, 1996). Otherwise, they progress through the\ndifferent stages of the cell-cycle, however slow\nthis process might be due to arrest of the G1=S\ntransition.\nThe experimental evidence above suggests that over-\nexpression of p27 (via hypoxia) arrests cell growth. In\naddition, in the presence of growth factors, expression\nof p27 in certain cell types is reduced (Leshem and\nHalevy, 2002; Saito et al., 2001).

Thus, expression\nof p27 is tightly coupled to cell growth.\nOur aim now is to incorporate these experimental\nobservations into a mathematical model for hypoxia-\ninduced G1 arrest. We do this by using a simplified\nversion of the mechanism shown in Fig. 3(a): unlike\nGardner et al. (2001), we consider only one (generic)\ncyclin-CDK complex and do not account for E2F\nexplicitly. Instead, we assume that phosphorylated RB\n(RBP) activates the cyclin-CDK complex directly\n(Knudsen et al., 1999).\n2.2. Cell-cycle model for normal cells\nHere, we propose a model which reproduces qualita-\ntively the behaviour observed in normal (non-cancerous)\ncells. In Section 2.3, we modify the model to account for\nsome of the features of cancer cells. The central element\nof our model of the cell-cycle is the biological switch\ndeveloped by Tyson and Novak (2001). We modify it to\naccount for the effects of hypoxia and p27 on cell\ndivision. The switching behaviour arises from the\nantagonism between the cyclin-CDK, y; and the Cdh1-\nAPC complexes, x; with the mass of the cell, m;\ntriggering the switch. The inhibitory effect of p27, z;\non the cyclin-CDK complexes is incorporated in Eq. (2)\nthrough an extra decay term proportional to the\nconcentration of p27 (see Eq. (5)). The equation for\nthe evolution of z (Eq. (7)) derives from the following\nconsiderations. Growth affects p27 expression: growth\nactivation downregulates p27 expression whereas\ngrowth inhibition increases it. In addition, p27 expres-\nsion is upregulated by hypoxia.\nAnother feature we include in our model is the effect\nof phosphorylated RB. Non-phosphorylated RB\n(RBNP) is known to inhibit CDK activity (Knudsen\net al., 1999) while phosphorylated RB has no direct\neffect (Gardner et al., 2001). We incorporate this effect\ninto our model by replacing the generic activator A in\nEq. (1) by the concentration of RBNP, u: Thus, we have\nindirect activation of CDK through RB phosphoryla-\ntion. Combining these effects we obtain the followingdimensionless model:\ndx\ndt\n\u00bc\n\u00f01\u00fe b3u\u00de\u00f01\u0006 x\u00de\nJ3 \u00fe 1\u0006 x\n\u0006\nb4mxy\nJ4 \u00fe x\n; \u00f04\u00de\ndy\ndt\n\u00bc a4 \u0006 \u00f0a1 \u00fe a2x \u00fe a3z\u00dey; \u00f05\u00de\ndm\ndt\n\u00bc Zm 1\u0006\nm\nm\u0001\n\u0001 \u0002\n; \u00f06\u00de\ndz\ndt\n\u00bc c1 1\u0006\nm\nm\u0001\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u0006 c2\nP\nB \u00fe P\nz; \u00f07\u00de\ndu\ndt\n\u00bc d1 \u0006 \u00f0d2 \u00fe d1y\u00deu; \u00f08\u00de\nwhere P is the (non-dimensional) oxygen tension. Cell\ndivision is supposed to occur when xoxTHR and y >\nyTHR (xTHRoyTHR).4 The use of this condition is\njustified by the fact that the biomolecular machinery\nresponsible for completing the cell-cycle is triggered\nwhen it is satisfied (Nasmyth, 1995). When this occurs\nthe cell-cycle control is reset by m-m=2 and z-0:\nWhen m and z are so reset the whole control system goes\nback to the dynamical state corresponding to G1; i.e. the\ncorresponding values of x; y and u go back automati-\ncally to their \u2018\u2018G1 values\u2019\u2019; since, as we show in Section\n4, when m \u00bc m\u0001=2 and z \u00bc 0 the fixed point corre-\nsponding to S-G2-M is destroyed and the only stable\nsteady state is G1: The instant at which this occurs is\ndefined as the division time, TD; assuming that we are\nstarting from t \u00bc 0:\nIn Eqs. (4)\u2013(8), we have introduced a dimensionless\ntime t \u00bc k002t with k\n00\n2 \u00bc 1 min\n\u00061 (Tyson and Novak,\n2001). Recall that in the model proposed by Tyson and\nNovak (2001) the concentrations are dimensionless and\nall the rate constants have the dimensions of frequency.\nNote that our model is slightly different from the\nmodel by Tyson and Novak (2001). However, our model\nis simpler and in the basic facts both models are\nequivalent. The main difference between the two models\nis that we are assuming that Eq. (5) is an equation for\nthe active CDK (i.e. the dimers cyc\/CDK), whereas\nEq. (6) in Tyson and Novak, 2001 corresponds to the\ntotal concentration of CDK (active + inactive). There-\nfore, the last term on the right-hand side of Eq. (5)\naccounts for the inactivation of CDK. In this way we are\nable to retain the main characteristics of the control\nsystem described in Tyson and Novak (2001) without\nhaving to introduce an additional variable to describe,\nfor example, inactive CDK. Both our model and that of\nTyson and Novak (2001) exhibit a G1-like steady state\n(stable when the cell is small) and a S-G2-M-like steady\nstate (stable when the cell is full-sized).\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nT. Alarc !on et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 229 (2004) 395\u20134114002.3. Experimental background and cell-cycle model for\ncancer cells\nIn many respects cancer cells appear to respond\ndifferently to hypoxia than their normal counterparts.\nAlthough cell-cycle arrest is observed in cancer cells\n(Funk, 1999), they also have the ability to enter a\nquiescent state in which most of their functions,\nincluding proliferation, are suspended. In a seminal\nexperiment performed by Folkman and Hochberg\n(1973), an in vitro 3D culture of cancer cells exposed\nperiodically to fresh nutrient solution saturated to a\nlimit size. Furthermore, the resulting multi-cellular\nspheroid had a layered structure: in the centre of the\nspheroid, where the nutrient concentration was smallest,\nthere was a core of necrotic material formed by cells that\nhad starved to death. In the outer rim, the nutrient\nconcentration was richest and there was a layer of\nproliferating cells. A layer of quiescent cells separated\nthese two regions. This experiment suggests that cancer\ncells, when starved of nutrient, enter a quiescent state\nbefore dying. One could argue that this behaviour might\nnot be exclusive to cancer cells. However, we have not\nfound so far direct experimental observation of such a\nbehaviour (i.e. the formation of a quiescent layer) in, for\nexample, multi-cellular spheroids of hepatocytes. Mod-\nelling this difference in the behaviour of normal and\ncancer cells is one of the main aims of this paper.\nSo, whereas normal cells simply delay their cell\ndivision process under hypoxia, cancer cells actually\nstop it, until the environmental conditions are favour-\nable, by entering into a quiescent state. This is one of the\nreasons why cancer cells are more resistant to hypoxia\nthan their normal counterparts (Royds et al., 1998).\nAnother difference between cancer and normal cells\nconcerns their rates of expression of p27 (Funk, 1999;\nBai et al., 2001; Philipp-Staheli et al., 2001).\nWe have presented experimental observations sup-\nporting the fact that growth regulates (decreases) p27\nexpression (Leshem and Halevy, 2002; Saito et al.,\n2001). Our modelling hypothesis is that this control\nmechanism is absent in cancer cells. In particular\nwhereas the rate at which normal cells produce p27 is\nassumed to be modulated by their mass, in cancer cells\np27 is produced at a constant rate. This is supported by\nDhillon and Mudryj (1995) and Park et al. (2001), who\nreport experiments in which the response of p27 in\ncancer cells to the presence of different growth and\nproliferation promoting factors is not as expected in\nnormal cells, i.e. the downregulation observed in normal\ncells is not found in cancer cells. Thus, our mathematical\nmodel for the cell-cycle comprises Eqs. (4)\u2013(8), with\nEq. (7) replaced by\ndz\ndt\n\u00bc c1 \u0006 c2\nP\nB \u00fe P\nz: \u00f09\u00deHere, we are assuming that there is a (constant)\nbackground production of p27 and simple linear decay\nmodulated by the oxygen tension, P:\nIn the case of the normal cell model we could reset\nonly m and let the value of z readjust by itself. Since, in\nthe cancer model, the p27 dynamics is independent of m;\nwe still need to prescribe a resetting mechanism at the\nend of the cell-cycle. Since we want to analyse the\ndifferent effects of hypoxia on normal and cancer cells,\nwe introduce as few differences as possible between the\ntwo models. This will ensure that we are observing the\nhypoxia-induced phenomena, rather than \u2018\u2018spurious\u2019\u2019\neffects introduced by other factors, and, therefore, we\nintroduce a resetting mechanisms for both models.3. Numerical results and comparison to experiments\nWe solve our model equations numerically and show\nthat our results are in good qualitative agreement with\nthe experimental observations.\nOur model equations were integrated using a stan-\ndard, four-stage Runge\u2013Kutta method (Press et al.,\n1992) with initial conditions x\u00f0t \u00bc 0\u00de \u00bc 0:9; y\u00f0t \u00bc 0\u00de \u00bc\n0:01; m\u00f0t \u00bc 0\u00de \u00bc m\u0001=2; z\u00f0t \u00bc 0\u00de \u00bc 0 and u\u00f0t \u00bc 0\u00de \u00bc 1:\nTypical numerical solutions of Eqs. (4)\u2013(8), presented\nin Fig. 4, show how reducing the oxygen tension extends\nthe cell-cycle by prolonging the duration of G1: On\ncloser scrutiny, our simulations indicate that a reduction\nin the oxygen tension by a factor 1\/40\u20131\/50 increases the\nduration of G1 by 20\u201325%. This means that in a large\npopulation of (identical) cells, we will observe on\naverage approximately 20\u201325% more cells in the G1\nphase. A similar increase was observed in experiments\nby Gardner et al. (2001). This can be seen in Fig. 6\nwhere we show how for normal cells the division time,\nTD; varies with the oxygen tension.\nThe numerical results presented in Figs. 5(a) and (b)\nshow how, for our cancer model (Eqs. (4)\u2013(6) and (8)\u2013\n(9)), the length of the cell-cycle increases as the oxygen\ntension decreases. However, Fig. 5(c) shows that this\nincrease does not continue indefinitely: for very low\noxygen tensions the model predicts that hypoxia causes\nthe cell-cycle to stop. This is consistent with the\nobserved transition of cancer cells to quiescence under\nhypoxia.\nFrom the mathematical point of view, the system\npasses through a bifurcation point as P varies: when P\nexceeds a critical value normal cycling is observed. If,\nhowever, P falls below the critical value then the\nsystem has only one stable steady state; G1 (high\nconcentration of Cdh and low concentration of active\nCDK) and cycling is arrested. We can also appreciate\nthis by reference to Fig. 6 which shows how the division\ntime, TD; of normal and cancer cells depends on the\noxygen tension, P: The curve corresponding to the\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nx,\n y\n(a) t (min)\n0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nx,\n y\n(b) t (min)\n0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nx,\n y\n(c) t (min)\nFig. 4.

This is to\nbe expected since the proliferation rate of cancer\ncells is usually higher than that of their normal\ncounterparts. Our model also reproduces the fact that\np27 expression is downregulated for the cancer cells\n(see Fig. 7). This characteristic feature of cancer\ncells has been observed by a number of experimental\nresearchers (see for example Funk, 1999; Bai et al.,\n2001; Philipp-Staheli et al., 2001). Actually, our\nmodel predicts that these two features (higher pro-\nliferation rate and reduced p27 expression) are closely\nrelated.\nWe now analyse the effects of varying the levels of p27\nexpression. To this end, we vary c1; since this parameter\ncontrols the production rate of p27. In Fig. 8 we show\nhow the behaviour of the cancer cell model changes as c1\nvaries. Fig. 8(a) illustrates that the average p27\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nT.

In addition the\ndivision time TD increases with c1; becoming infinite as\nc1 approaches a critical value (which depends on the\noxygen tension, P). Taken together, the results of Figs. 6\nand 8 yield a testable model prediction regarding\nquiescence in cancer cells: quiescence may be induced\nby either low levels of oxygen or high levels of p27.0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000\nt (min)\n0\n1\n2\n3\nz\nFig. 7.

Within our model\nframework, we can explain this by observing that low\nconcentrations of p27 are associated with high prolif-\neration rates. In fact, Kirla et al. (2003) argue that\nexpression of p27 in malignant astrocytomas, and its\npoor prognostic nature, appears to reflect the prolifera-\ntion activity of tumour cells.\nFor normal cells p27 levels are affected by the\npresence of growth factors (Leshem and Halevy, 2002;\nSaito et al., 2001). Hence, we now investigate the effect\nof varying the mass growth rate Z on the behaviour of\nnormal cells. In particular, we solve Eqs. (4)\u2013(8) for\ndifferent values of the parameter Z (the mass growth\nrate) and plot the averaged concentration of p27 as a\nfunction of Z: Fig. 9 shows that \/zS is a decreasing\nfunction of the growth rate. Thus, in the presence of a\ngrowth factor (i.e. for a bigger growth rate) our model\npredicts smaller concentrations of p27. This is consistent\nwith the experimental results of Leshem and Halevy\n(2002) and Saito et al. (2001), according to which, in the\npresence of growth factors p27 expression is lower than\nthat in unstimulated control cells.\nThe results described above support our hypothesis\nthat the two models reproduce the different responses of\nnormal and cancer cells to hypoxia. However, we find\none potential problem: Figs. 4 and 5 imply that there is a\nsignificant reduction in the concentration of active CDK\nin the cancer cells.

It could be that the levels of Cyc-CDK\npredicted by our cancer cell-cycle model are too low to\ntrigger RB-phosphorylation.5Tyson and Novak (2001) estimate this critical value to be about\n0.58 for the parameter values stated in Table 1.4. Phase plane analysis\nIn this section, we use phase plane analysis to explain\nwhy, when we use the parameter values given by Tyson\nand Novak (2001), both models are able to produce\narrest but only the cancer model can yield quiescence. In\nparticular, we show that the switching behaviour in\nthese models is controlled by both growth and the\nkinetics of p27 expression in particular the kinetics used\nto model p27 expression in normal and cancer cells\nis responsible for the dramatic differences in their\nbehaviour.\nAt the beginning of the cell-cycle (at G1), the cell-cycle\ncontrol system is in a state in which xC1 and y5x:\nThen, according to Tyson and Novak (2001), the system\ngoes through a bifurcation (with the mass of the cell as\nthe control parameter) and changes to a state in which\nxC0 and ybx: This bifurcation corresponds to the\nG1=S transition. Hence, for m \u00bc 0 (i.e. at the beginning\nof the cell-cycle), we expect to find a stationary state\nwith xC1 and y5x whereas for m \u00bc m\u0001 (i.e. towards\nthe end of the cell-cycle), we expect the stationary state\nshould be such that xC0 and ybx: We will show that,\nprovided we use the parameter values given by Tysonand Novak (2001), the normal cell-cycle model exhibits\nthis behaviour for every value of P: On the other hand,\nthe cancer cell-cycle model exhibits this behaviour only\nif P exceeds a critical value. When P is below this value,\nthe cancer cell-cycle model does not have a steady state\nwith xC0 and ybx for m \u00bc m\u0001: Instead, it gets \u2018\u2018stuck\u2019\u2019\nat xC1 and y5x (i.e. at G1). It is in this sense that we\ndistinguish between arrest and quiescence: whereas for\nthe former the cell will always complete the cell-cycle\n(probably in such a long time that it would be die via\napoptosis first), in the latter case the cell will never\ncomplete the cell-cycle since the control system has lost\nthe ability to produce the bifurcation that drives the\nsystem through the G1=S transition.\n4.1. Phase portraits\nAs in Tyson and Novak (2001), the central control\nmechanism for our models resides in Eqs. (4) and(5). To\nstart with, let us fix z \u00bc z0; m \u00bc m0; u \u00bc u0 in Eqs.

(4)\nand (5) exhibit a saddle-node bifurcation when m0 takes\na critical value5 (see Fig. 10). For smaller values of m0\nEqs. (4) and (5) have two stable fixed points (SFP) and\nan unstable fixed point (UFP).

When m0 increases towards its critical value G1\ncollides with the UFP and a saddle-node bifurcation\noccurs. Only the S-G2-M fixed point persists for larger\nvalues of m0:\nLet us see how this picture is modified as z varies. The\ncorresponding phase-plane, presented in Fig. 11, shows\nthat when m0 \u00bc 5 (Fig. 11(a)) Eqs. (4) and (5) have only\none steady state, regardless of the value of z0:\nThe picture is qualitatively different when m0 has a\nhigher value, say m0 \u00bc m\u0001: In this case the variation of\nz0 produces a switching behaviour: for values of z0\nsmaller than some critical value the only SFP is the\nS-G2-M fixed point, whereas for z0 larger than its critical\nvalue the only SFP is the G1 fixed point.\nThus, for the normal cells, the situation is as follows.\nReferring to Fig. 7 we recall that over time the\nconcentration of p27 grows, reaches a maximum value\nand then decreases. This pattern is repeated cyclically\neach time the cell divides. At the end of the cycle p27 is\ndecreasing and therefore, according to Fig. 11(b), the\nsystem is driven towards the S-G2-M fixed point.\nThe behaviour of cancer cells can also be explained in\nterms of the phase-plane shown in Fig. 11. According to\nFig. 7, the concentration of p27 grows monotonically to\na saturating (steady state) value, until the control system\nis reset to its initial condition. This steady state value,\nzN \u00bc c1\u00f0B \u00fe P\u00de=c2P; depends on the oxygen concentra-\ntion, P: When P is sufficiently small zN exceeds a critical\nvalue and, as shown in Fig. 11(b), the control system\ngets trapped at the G1 fixed point. This brings the cell-\ncycle to a halt. If, on the contrary, the oxygen\nconcentration is such that z\u0001 is smaller than the critical\nvalue, the system oscillates by the same mechanism as\nfor the normal cells.A more rigorous analysis of all these features is\npresented in Appendix A.\n4.2. Summary of results of the phase plane analysis\nThe results of Appendix A are summarized here and\nillustrated by Fig. 12. This figure shows the bifurcation\ndiagrams of the normal (Figs. 12(a) and (b)) and the\ncancer (Figs. 12(c) and (d)) models, excluding the\nequation for the mass, which is viewed as a control\nparameter. To obtain these diagrams we have computed\nnumerically the steady state values xN; yN; zN; and uN\nfor different values of the cell mass and the oxygen level.\nStability of the steady state solutions is determined by\nlinearizing the model equations. Figs. 12(a) and (c) show\nthe bifurcation diagrams for normal and cancer cells,\nrespectively, when m is the control parameter and the\noxygen level is P \u00bc 1: The figures show that the\nswitching behaviour of each system is driven by growth:\nas m increases the systems go through successive\nbifurcations which produce the transition from G1; the\nstable fixed point for small values of m; to S-G2-M, the\nstable fixed point when m approaches its saturation\nvalue. This agrees with the results obtained from our\nlinear stability analysis: for large values of the oxygen\nlevel (as P \u00bc 1), these are the stable fixed points for the\ncorresponding values of m:\nDifferences between the two models appear when we\nconsider low oxygen levels. Our linear stability analysis\nhas revealed that G1 is the only fixed point at the\nbeginning of the cell-cycle (i.e. small values of m) for\nboth models. So, we focus on the end of the cell-cycle\nwhen m \u00bc m\u0001 and take P as the control parameter.\nFigs. 12(b) and (d) show the dramatic difference\nbetween the models as P varies.

Alarc !on et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 229 (2004) 395\u2013411 405of the normal cell model (Fig. 12(b)) is independent of P\n(S-G2-M is the stable fixed point for all values of P), the\nstable fixed point of the cancer model depends on P:\nwhen P is smaller than some critical value the stable\nfixed point is G1 (thus yielding quiescence) whereas for\nP larger than the critical value the stable fixed point is\nS-G2-M. This is consistent with our linear stability\nanalysis and the phase-portrait-based discussion of\nSection 3.1, where we saw that quiescence in the cancer\ncell model is related to high values of z towards the end\nof the cell-cycle for this model, high values of z occur\nwhen the oxygen tension is low.\nThroughout this paper, we have emphasized that\nnormal cells do not have the ability to enter a quiescent\nstate under hypoxia. However, in Section A.1 we have\nshown that our normal cell model can produce\nquiescence if b4m\u0001CO\u00f01\u00de: This allows for the possibility\nof having quiescence in normal cells due to mechanisms\n(different from hypoxia) that drive the system into this\nparameter regime.5. Discussion\nIn this paper, we have adapted an existing mathema-\ntical model of the cell-cycle to describe the behaviour of\nnormal and cancer cells, focussing on the differences in\ntheir responses to hypoxia. Our models are successful in\nproducing hypoxia-induced arrest of the G1=S transi-\ntion, in agreement with experimental observations\n(Funk, 1999; Gardner et al., 2001). In the case of\nnormal cells, the relative increase in the duration of the\ncell-cycle is similar to that observed by Gardner et al.\n(2001). However, whilst both models can produce arrest,\nonly the cancer cell-cycle model is able to yield\nquiescence, as long as we use the parameter values\ngiven in Table 1, which are due to Tyson and Novak\n(2001). However, in other parameter regimes, the\nnormal cell-cycle model might produce quiescence.\nThe difference between the two models stems from\ndifferences in their rates of p27 expression: for normal\ncells p27 expression is growth-regulated (i.e. it depends\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nTable 1\nSummary of those (non-dimensional) parameter values that are held\nfixed throughout the paper, unless otherwise stated\nParameter Value\n(normal)\nValue\n(cancer)\nSource\na4 0.04 0.04 Tyson and Novak (2001)\na1 0.5 0.4 Tyson and Novak (2001)\na2 1 1 Tyson and Novak (2001)\na3 0.25 0.25\nb3 10 10 Tyson and Novak (2001)\nb4 35 35 Tyson and Novak (2001)\nZ 0.01 0.01 Tyson and Novak (2001)\nm\u0001 10 10 Tyson and Novak (2001)\nJ3; J4 0.04 0.04 Tyson and Novak (2001)\nc1 0.1 0.007\nc2 0.01 0.01\nB 0.01 0.01\nd1 0.01 0.01\nd2 0.1 0.1\nThe values of the parameters for which we have not found estimates in\nthe literature have been calculated to fit the values of the duplication\ntimes of V-79 cancer cells reported by Deutsch and Dormann (2002).\nAccording to these authors the division time for V-79 cells is between\n13 and 19 h (780 and 1140 min; respectively), which is in good\nagreement with our predicted division time for cancer cells exposed to\nhigh concentrations of oxygen (see Fig. 6).\n6 In these experiments, nutrient is available to all the cells in the\nmonolayer culture. However, in 3D spheroids nutrient availability is\nlimited, since it enters the spheroid by diffusion through the surface of\nthe spheroid. This fact explains why on average spheroids experience\nlower oxygen tensions than monolayer cultures.\nT. Alarc !on et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 229 (2004) 395\u2013411406on the cell mass) whereas for the cancer cells it is\ngrowth-independent. We justify these modelling as-\nsumptions by appealing to experiments by Leshem and\nHalevy (2002) and Saito et al. (2001). They found that in\nthe presence of growth factors normal cells reduced their\nrates of p27 expression whereas cancer cells did not\n(Dhillon and Mudryj, 1995; Park et al., 2001). Another\nfact supporting our hypothesis is that mutations of the\np27 gene are rarely found in human tumours (Funk,\n1999), supporting the fact that changes in the mechan-\nism regulating its expression might play a key role in\nalterating the behaviour of cancer cells.\nOur model also reproduces other experimental\nobservations: higher proliferation rates in cancer than\nin normal cells (see Fig. 6 and Funk, 1999), lower levels\nof the protein p27 in cancer than in normal cells (see\nFig. 7 and Funk, 1999; Bai et al., 2001; Philipp-Staheli\net al., 2001) and, in the case of the normal cell model,\nlower levels of p27 in the presence of growth factors (i.e.\nhigher values of Z) (see Fig. 9 and Leshem and Halevy,\n2002; Saito et al., 2001). Our results are also consistent\nwith a clinical study which showed that low levels of p27\nwere a poor prognostic factor, since low levels of p27 are\nrelated to an increase in the proliferation rate (see Fig. 8\nand Kirla et al., 2003). In addition our model predicts\nthat quiescence in cancer cells could be induced by\nincreasing p27 levels. This is experimentally testable.\nWhile our model is consistent with a number of\nexperimental observations and generates experimentallytestable predictions, it possesses some shortcomings that\nrequire further refinement. For example, it does not deal\nproperly with the end of the cell-cycle: in our simula-\ntions the division cycle finishes when xoxTHR and y >\nyTHR (yTHRoxTHR), where x \u00bc \u00bdCdh\t and y \u00bc \u00bdCyc\t:\nBiologically, the justification for this is that under this\ncondition the biomolecular machinery responsible for\ncompleting the cell-cycle is triggered. A more accurate\ndescription of the \u2018\u2018Finish\u2019\u2019 transition, as in Tyson and\nNovak (2001), is postponed for future work.\nOur model should also incorporate hypoxia-induced\napoptosis, since both normal and cancer cells undergo\nprogrammed cell death when the level of oxygen is very\nlow, with even the cancer cells dying when exposed to a\nprolonged hypoxic stress.\nIt is important to stress that whilst we have focused on\nthe role of the protein p27 as a mediator of cell response\nto oxygen starvation, in particular hypoxia-induced\narrest and quiescence, other mechanisms involving\ndifferent pathways may be relevant. We have shown in\nour linear stability analysis that the normal cell-cycle\nmodel cannot produce quiescence, since our parameter\nvalues are such that b4m\u0001CO\u00f0e\u00061\u00de: However, the\nnormal cell-cycle model would exhibit quiescence if\nb4m\u0001CO\u00f01\u00de; where m\u0001 is the maximum size of a fully\ngrown cell and b4 accounts for the intensity of the\ncoupling between growth and \u00bdCdh\t dynamics. Thus,\npossible mechanisms to induce quiescence in this model\nwould be to reduce the value of either b4 or m\u0001: Whether\nthis is biologically feasible should be the subject of\nfurther experimental investigation.\nWe have assumed that normal cells do not enter\nquiescence under oxygen starvation, although quies-\ncence induced by other mechanisms is not excluded. On\nthe contrary, in experiments carried out in tumour\nmulticellular spheroids starvation induced quiescence\nhas been observed. On the other hand, Hamamoto et al.\n(1998) reported that hepatocytes cultured as spheroids\ngrew more slowly than hepatocytes cultured in 2D\nmonolayer cultures.6 Also a higher concentration of p27\nwas observed in the spheroids. Both of these facts might\nbe signatures of quiescence. However, to the best of our\nknowledge, no direct observation of a quiescent region\nin normal cell spheroids has been reported so far. On the\nother hand, our normal cell-cycle model can explain\nmost of the behaviour observed in the hepatocyte\nexperiments: the increased p27 levels would be caused\nby the reduction in oxygen and this, in turn, would\ndiminish the proliferation rate (see Section 3). The\nsmaller growth rate could be caused by a balance\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nT. Alarc !on et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 229 (2004) 395\u2013411 407between proliferation and death, rather than being\nproduced by a quiescent population of cells.\nThere is one factor that has not been taken into\naccount in this article, but that might be important,\nthat is the relationship between growth and\nprogression through the cell-cycle. The average size\n(diameter) of a normal cell is estimated to be\napproximately 10 mm; although the variance associated\nwith this figure is very large. Experiments performed by\nSauer et al. (1998) report measurements of the size of\nquiescent cancer cells in multicellular spheroids aver-\naging 13 mm in diameter. They also find that cycling\ncancer cells within the spheroids grow to 18 mm in\ndiameter. This reveals an intricate relationship\nbetween growth and cell-cycle, which is neglected in\nour model where growth is considered as an autono-\nmous process.\nTo summarize, we have proposed models for the\nhypoxia-induced response of the G1=S transition in\nboth normal and cancer cells. Our models reproduce a\nrange of experimental observations on each type\nof cell. In particular, our simulations provide a\nmechanism to understand how cancer cells may\nbecome quiescent under low levels of oxygen. We have\nbeen able to define this property in mathematical terms:\nwhereas the G1=S transition in normal and non-\nquiescent cancer cells is driven by a bifurcation\nin the dynamics of the CDK network, quiescent\ncells are characterized by the absence of such a\nbifurcation.Acknowledgements\nTA thanks the EU Research Training Network (5th\nFramework): \u2018\u2018Using mathematical modelling and\ncomputer simulation to improve cancer therapy\u2019\u2019 for\nfunding this research.

This\nmay raise the question of how robust our results are to\nchanges in the parameters given by Tyson and Novak\n(2001). We have made additional analysis and run\nnumerical simulations to check robustness with respect\nto b4m\u0001 (results not shown).

The corresponding linear\nanalysis (in which only Eqs.

As for the\nnormal cell model, mN \u00bc 0 is an unstable fixed point of\nEq. (A.3) which decouples. Viewing m as a time-\ndependent control parameter, we say that the dynamical\nsystem possesses a stable branch for values of m smaller\nthan some critical value (see Fig. 12(c)).\nAs before, mN \u00bc m\u0001 is in general incompatible with\nEq. (A.24), since the steady-state condition would read:\nb4m\u0001yN \u00bc e\u00f01\u00fe b3uN\u00de #xN: However, Eqs. (A.29) and\n(A.30) imply that if P-0 then yN-0: Thus, there exists\nP0 > 0 such that if PoP0 then the term b4m\u0001yNCO\u00f0e\u00de:\nThis condition is satisfied when zNCO\u00f0e\u00061\u00de; which\nyields yNCO\u00f0e2\u00de: Therefore, for PoP0; we make the\nfollowing rescaling: #m \u00bc m=m\u0001; #z \u00bc z=e;\n8 and b4m\u0001 \u00bc\ne\u00061 #b4; so that we can rewrite Eqs.

We have found that our analytical calculation\nis in excellent agreement with the numerics, but only for\nvalues of the oxygen concentration deep inside the\nhypoxic regime \u00f0PC10\u00064\u00de: However, the asymptotics\nfails to predict the critical value of the oxygen\nconcentration for hypoxia-induced quiescence\n(PC0:008; see Fig. 6). This is due to the fact that, for\nthe cancer cell-cycle model, the validity of the approx-\nimation x \u00bc 1\u0006 e *x depends on the oxygen level: it is a\ngood approximation for very low levels of oxygen.\nA similar analysis, carried out when x \u00bc e #x; which\ncorresponds to the end of the cell-cycle, yields\ne\nd #x\ndt\n\u00bc \u00f01\u00fe b3u\u00de \u0006\nb4my #x\n#J4 \u00fe #x\n; \u00f0A:52\u00de\ndy\ndt\n\u00bc a4 \u0006 \u00f0a1 \u00fe a3z\u00dey; \u00f0A:53\u00de\ndm\ndt\n\u00bc Zm 1\u0006\nm\nm\u0001\n\u0001 \u0002\n; \u00f0A:54\u00de\ndz\ndt\n\u00bc c1 \u0006 c2\nP\nB \u00fe P\nz; \u00f0A:55\u00de\ndu\ndt\n\u00bc d2\u00f01\u0006 u\u00de \u0006 d1yu: \u00f0A:56\u00de\nAs in Section 4.2, the only physically realistic fixed point\nof Eq. (A.54) is mN \u00bc m\u0001 (since mN \u00bc 0) uNo0) in\nwhich case:\nzN \u00bc\nc1\u00f0B \u00fe P\u00de\nc2P\n; \u00f0A:57\u00de\nyN \u00bc\na4\na1 \u00fe a3zN\n; \u00f0A:58\u00de\nuN \u00bc\nd2\nd2 \u00fe d1yN\n\u00f0A:59\u00de\nand xN \u00bc 0 to leading order. Again, given that\nEq. (A.54) decouples and that mN \u00bc m\u0001 is a stable\nfixed point of Eq. (A.54), we can study the linear\nstability of the system to leading order by linearizing\nEqs. (A.53), (A.55) and (A.56). This process eventually\nleads to the following characteristic equation for theeigenvalues l:\n\u00f0a1 \u00fe a3zN \u00fe l\u00de\u00f0d2 \u00fe d1yN \u00fe l\u00de\n\n c2\nP\nB \u00fe P\n\u00fe l\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u00bc 0: \u00f0A:60\u00de\nAll the roots of Eq. (A.60) are real and negative. As in\nthe case of the normal cell-cycle model, the first-order\ncorrection terms yield important information about the\nbehaviour of the system. From Eq. (A.52) with x \u00bc e #x\nwe have that\n#xN \u00bc\n#J4\n\u00f0b4m\u0001yN=1\u00fe b3uN\u00de \u0006 1\n; \u00f0A:61\u00de\nwhich leads to the condition:\nb4m\u0001yN\n1\u00fe b3uN\n> 1: \u00f0A:62\u00de\nAfter some algebra, we deduce that this condition is\nsatisfied if yN > %yN where %yN is given by Eq. (A.23).\nFrom Eqs. (A.57) and (A.58), we can see that the\ncondition yN > %yN implies the existence of a threshold\noxygen concentration, %P; such that #xNo0 if Po %P:\nThus, if Po %P there is no physically realistic fixed point\nof Eqs. (A.52)\u2013(A.56). Biologically, this means that the\ncontrol system of the cell-cycle gets stuck in the G1\nphase, thus yielding quiescent behaviour. On the\ncontrary, for P > %P a linearly stable (of type S-G2-M)\nfixed point exists.\nWe have shown that our cancer cell model has a fixed\npoint with mN \u00bc 0 which corresponds to G1 (high\nvalues of x \u00bc \u00bdCdh\t and low values of y \u00bc \u00bdCyc\t),\nwhereas when mN \u00bc m\u0001 a stable fixed point corre-\nsponding to S-G2-M (low values of x \u00bc \u00bdCdh\t and high\nvalues of y \u00bc \u00bdCyc\t) exists only if the oxygen level\nexceeds a critical value. When the oxygen tension is\nbelow this critical value, the cancer model has a G1-like\nfixed point which is stable when mN \u00bc m\u0001; meaning\nthat the cancer cell-cycle model does not go through the\nG1=S transition; this explains why the cancer cell-cycle\nmodel is able to produce quiescence.References\nAlberts, B., Bray, D., Lewis, J., Raff, M., Roberts, K., Watson, J.D.,\n1994.
