An \nassessment is made of the UAE\u2019s defensive capabilities, within the context of the Abu \nDhabi-led and western-supplied UAE Armed Forces, followed by a discussion of the \nnumerous regional disputes and conflicts that continue to involve the UAE, notably \nthose concerning Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia.  Finally, the internal threat is \nconsidered, by investigating both the UAE\u2019s historical and contemporary role as a \nhub for criminal organisations and, perhaps most worryingly, its volatile relationship \nwith various terrorist groups and the potential menace posed by organised terrorism \nto Dubai\u2019s fragile foreign investment-dependent economy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 \nDubai and the United Arab Emirates: Security Threats \n \nChristopher M. Davidson\n1\n \n \n \n \nThe federation of United Arab Emirates has emerged as one of the Arab \nGulf\u2019s most successful post-oil states.  With political stability guaranteed by highly \nresilient, dynamic, and popular traditional monarchies,\n2\n the UAE has been able to \npress forward with developing a diverse economic base that up until the global credit \ncrunch enjoyed strong rates of growth and boasted an impressive track record in \nattracting foreign direct investment.  By 2008 the UAE\u2019s second largest constituent \nemirate, Dubai, was drawing over 97 percent of its GDP from non-oil sectors,\n3\n \nincluding a real estate industry, a world class luxury tourism industry, an international \nfinancial centre, and a range of re-exporting and other commercial activities based out \n                                                 \n1\n Dr. Christopher M. Davidson is a fellow of the Institute for Middle Eastern and \nIslamic Studies at Durham University, United Kingdom. \n2\n For a discussion of monarchical survival in the UAE and the \u2018ruling bargain\u2019 that \nexists between the ruling families and regular citizens see Christopher M.

Also see \nDavidson, Dubai, p.135. \n 2 \nof international \u2018free zones\u2019.4  While the real estate bubble has now burst and there \nhas been an overextension of leisure and tourism megaprojects, Dubai and its \nneighbouring emirates have historically confounded their critics, and are likely to \nrebound when the international conditions improve.  However, long term investor \nconfidence in these strategies remains in question given the UAE\u2019s awkward \ngeographic location close to regional hot spots, and given the rising level of other \nsecurity concerns, both external and internal.  Should such threats escalate, and ever \ndirectly or indirectly involve the UAE, then the federation\u2019s carefully cultivated \nreputation for political and economic stability would likely decline, thereby severely \nimpacting upon its fragile foreign investment-dependent development trajectory. \n \nAs the first section of this article will demonstrate, the UAE\u2019s wealthiest \nemirate, Abu Dhabi, has built up the UAE Armed Forces in recent decades by \nprocuring some of the finest military hardware available.  This has placed the UAE in \na much stronger position, especially with the menace of Iraq having subsided since \nSaddam Hussein\u2019s fall in 2003.  Nevertheless, the UAE\u2019s defensive capabilities are \neither insufficient or inappropriate for countering remaining regional threats from Iran \nor, to a lesser extent, other Arab states.  As such, the federation has had little option \nbut to remain under a western military umbrella.  This not only undermines the \nUAE\u2019s current preference for neutrality, but also may weaken the legitimacy of a \n                                                 \n4\n For a discussion of Dubai\u2019s development model see Martin Hvidt, \u2018Public-Private \nTies and their Contribution to Development: The Case of Dubai,\u2019 Middle Eastern \nStudies, 43:4 (2007); Davidson, Dubai, pp.113-135. \n \n 3 \nfederal government that has traditionally sought close relations with the Arab \nnationalist republics and the Arab League.\n 4 \nMoreover, as an unfortunate but perhaps inescapable hidden cost of its emergence as \nthe region\u2019s premier free port, for many years Dubai has attracted the attention of both \ninternational criminal and terrorist organisations, many of which have exploited the \nemirate\u2019s laissez-faire attitudes and impressive physical infrastructure5 to set up \nvarious smuggling, gunrunning, human trafficking, and money laundering \noperations.\n6\n  Most significantly, despite Dubai\u2019s undoubted usefulness to such groups, \nthe final section of this article will reveal that the UAE has been unable to remain \ncompletely in the eye of the storm and has suffered from a number of terrorist attacks \non its own soil. \n \n \nMilitary Power \n \n The first formal security force tasked with protecting the sheikhdoms of the \nlower Gulf was set up in the late 1950s.  By the late 1960s, the British-officered \nTrucial Oman Scouts (previously known as Levies) were being funded almost \nexclusively by Abu Dhabi, as its oil revenues began to accumulate.\n7\n  Britain had \nanticipated that all regional divisions of the scouts would be amalgamated into one \nunified force following her withdrawal from the lower Gulf in 1971.  However, the \n                                                 \n5\n For a discussion of Dubai\u2019s infrastructural development see Ibid., pp.91-99, 106-\n113.  For a discussion of Dubai\u2019s early commitment to laissez-faire attitudes see Ibid., \npp.67-69. \n6\n For greater detail on such operations see Christopher M. Davidson, \u2018Dubai: The \nSecurity Dimensions of the Region\u2019s Premier Free Port\u2019, Middle East Policy, 15:2 \n(2008), pp.144-152. \n7\n Easa Saleh Al-Gurg, The Wells of Memory (London: John Murray, 1998), p.117. \n 5 \nnewly independent - albeit federated - emirates preferred to set up their own security \norganisations.  By the end of the year the Dubai Defence Force had 500 men and had \npurchased a number of patrol boats, fighter aircraft, and tanks.\n8\n  Although by the late \n1970s the DDF had approximately doubled in size, its commanders accepted that it \nwas impractical to create a full scale army and thus they preferred to concentrate on \nbuying high quality equipment so that Dubai would have a lightly armed task force \ncapable of rapid deployment in the event of emergency.\n9\n  As such, by the time that the \nDDF was finally absorbed by Abu Dhabi\u2019s much larger Union Defence Force in the \nmid-1990s, it had become a small but well-trained force with a tightly organised \nstructure (including a specific women\u2019s unit10) and superior hardware.  \nProblematically, however, given that Dubai had been procuring equipment \nindependently of Abu Dhabi for over 25 years, this meant that the newly reinforced \nand genuinely federal UAE Armed Forces was made up of largely incompatible \nhardware and munitions.  Perhaps as a symbol of autonomy, for much of the 1980s \nDubai had been sourcing its armaments from the USSR, North Korea,\n11\n and other \nWarsaw pact suppliers, whereas Abu Dhabi had been dealing almost exclusively with \nWestern European and North American manufacturers.

Most remarkably, the ruling \nfamilies of Umm al-Qawain and Ajman offered the UAE Armed Forces the services \nof their predominantly untrained retainers armed with little more than antiquated \nrifles.\n12\n \n \n Given the task of phasing out such mismatched weaponry and upgrading Abu \nDhabi\u2019s existing stocks, the UAE Armed Forces\u2019 chiefs of staff since this period have \nsecured military budgets of between $2 and $2.5 billion per annum,\n13\n have expanded \ntheir personnel to over 55,000,\n14\n and have frequently managed to gain permission \nfrom western governments to purchase the most sophisticated armaments \u2013 most of \nwhich are normally restricted to NATO allies.\n15\n  In particular, the UAE Armed Forces \nhas procured $3 billion worth of Leclerc main battle tanks from France\u2019s Nexter \n                                                 \n12\n Personal interviews with military advisors, Dubai (January 2007); Wilson, Rashid\u2019s \nLegacy, pp.343-344. \n13\n Janes Defense Weekly (7 February 2007). \n14\n Personal interviews with military advisors, Dubai (January 2007); Van Der Meulen, \n\u2018The Role of Tribal\u2019, p.95.

In addition, the DDF\u2019s old Russian-manufactured \nBMP-3 armoured personnel carriers have largely been replaced by about 100 Turkish-\nsupplied Savunma Sistemleri carriers.  Courtesy of France\u2019s Sagem D\u00e9fense S\u00e9curit\u00e9, \nindividual soldiers will soon be benefiting from modular infrared units that will allow \nimproved battlefield navigation between men.  Moreover, the UAE Armed Forces\u2019 \nartillery capabilities have been greatly enhanced following the purchase of howitzers \nfrom South Africa\u2019s Denel corporation and from the Royal Netherlands Army.  \nSimilarly, the UAE\u2019s air force has taken delivery of a large quantity of advanced \nequipment, including French-supplied Mirage 2000-9s complete with laser targeting \npods and precision-guided missiles, British Aerospace Hawk 128s, Sikorsky Black \nHawk helicopters, and about 30 Apache AH64 gunships.\n17\n  Furthermore, given the \nUAE\u2019s recent involvement in several international peacekeeping operations,18 its air \nforce has needed to improve its long range capabilities and has duly begun to acquire \na number of heavy airlift carriers from the Ukraine.  Most notably, the UAE Armed \nForces\u2019 massive purchase of 80 F16E Desert Falcons in 2004 has made the UAE one \nof Lockheed Martins\u2019 best customers.19  A few dozen of these have already arrived at \nAbu Dhabi\u2019s Al-Dhafrah airbase, and over the next few years the arrival of the \n                                                 \n16\n Oxford Business Group, \u2018Emerging Emirates\u2019 (London: 2000), pp.58-59. \n17\n Personal interviews with military advisors, Abu Dhabi (March 2007). \n18\n Including Somalia in 1992, Bosnia in 1995, and Kosovo in 1999.  See Davidson, \nDubai, p.172.  \n19\n Personal interviews with military advisors, Dubai (January 2007); Counterpunch (4 \nDecember 2004). \n 8 \nremainder should make the UAE\u2019s air force the second most advanced in the Middle \nEast, after Israel.\n20\n  \n \n Unlike most other militaries in the developing world, the UAE Armed Forces \nhas committed itself heavily to purchasing custom-made equipment manufactured by \njoint ventures between western arms companies and domestic enterprises.  With the \nreasoning that such products will be better suited to combat conditions in the Middle \nEastern theatre, while also promoting the diversification of the economy and \ngenerating employment across the federation, the strategy would seem to have found \nmuch favour in both government and industry circles.  Specifically, in cooperation \nwith a German company, the UAE has begun to manufacture its own military \nmotorcycles and its new Guardian jeeps.  Similarly, the air force has commissioned a \nproject to produce the \u2018Mako\u2019 light aircraft to be used for desert reconnaissance, and \nhas consulted with a British company over the development of Al-Hakeem precision \nguided missiles, and with the European MBDA Corporation over the design of UAE-\nspecific Black Shaheen cruise missiles.\n21\n  Although the UAE\u2019s navy has historically \nbeen small, with only one marine battalion and one naval squadron, and of less \nimmediate concern than the army or air force, it would appear that the same \ncollaborative strategy is being applied.  As part of the UAE Armed Forces\u2019 \u2018Project \nBaynunah,\u2019 in conjunction with a French manufacturer and the new Abu Dhabi \nShipbuilding Company, a number of new frigates and corvettes in addition to some \n                                                 \n20\n Janes Defense Weekly (7 February 2007). \n21\n Personal interviews with academic observers, Dubai (January 2007). \n 9 \nsmall amphibious craft and two-person mini submarines are under construction at \nAbu Dhabi\u2019s Mussafah facility, and should be delivered by 2009.22 \n \n With the UAE Armed Forces\u2019 main priority being improved defence, these \nland, air, and naval procurements will soon be complemented by far more advanced \nattack warning systems.  In particular, a large underground airbase is under \nconstruction somewhere in the southern desert of Abu Dhabi.  This will have a \nhardened shelter to allow the air force to survive a direct assault\n23\n and will be able to \nlink up with an integrated electronic warfare system supplied by Northrop Grumman \nand a number of newly acquired airborne early warning and control aircrafts \n(AWACs) provided by Boeing.  In addition, underwater surveillance systems are \nbeing installed at most of the UAE\u2019s naval bases, courtesy of the German Konigsberg \ncorporation, and the UAE Armed Forces will soon benefit from strategic data from a \nnew Space Reconnaissance Centre that is located somewhere in Abu Dhabi and has \naccess to Russian and North Korean satellite feeds.\n24\n \n \nThe Western Security Umbrella \n \n Despite the absorption of various emirate-level armed forces and several \nexpensive upgrades, the UAE\u2019s military strength remains weak.  There is considerable \nconcern that the UAE Armed Forces has insufficient personnel with the necessary \ntraining to operate such sophisticated hardware.  Moreover, there is a fear that given \n                                                 \n22\n Personal interviews with academic observers, Dubai (June 2006). \n23\n Janes Defense Weekly (7 February 2007). \n24\n Personal interviews with military advisors, Dubai (January 2007). \n 10 \nthe financially privileged backgrounds of most UAE nationals, most of those \nemployed by the UAE Armed Forces would not actually stand their ground in the \nevent of combat.  Indeed, given that military salaries are often much lower than other \nincomes, especially those derived from family businesses and landlordship, a career in \nthe armed forces is often looked upon as a source of additional status rather than as a \nsource of livelihood.  Thus, for lower and middle-ranking servicemen, military \nmisconduct would not lead to complete socioeconomic destruction.  Perhaps most \nworryingly, however, as with many other public sector professions in the UAE, \nincluding the civil service and the police, there are thought to be a growing number of \nexpatriates employed by the UAE Armed Forces.  Certainly, of the 55,000 military \npersonnel, it has been estimated that over 15,000 are foreigners, most of whom are \nYemenis and Egyptians.\n25\n  Understandably this has led to much disquiet over the \ndependency on mercenaries who cannot be relied upon to the same extent as \nindigenous professional soldiers.  \n \n As such, despite the obvious costs to their legitimacy resources, in particular \ntheir commitment to the Palestinian nation and other Arab and Muslim causes,\n26\n the \nUAE\u2019s ruling families have had little choice but to remain under the security umbrella \nof western militaries that are predominantly made up of non-Arab, non-Muslim \npersonnel, and which are directed by governments that are in de facto alliance with \nIsrael.  Most notably, France, which has been the UAE Armed Forces\u2019 greatest arms \nsupplier since the 1993 Leclerc deal, has agreed to deploy 75,000 troops to the UAE \nin the event of an emergency, and it is believed that Britain signed a similar defence \n                                                 \n25\n Personal interviews with military advisors, Dubai (January 2007). \n26\n See Davidson, The UAE, pp.80-82. \n 11 \npact in the late 1990s, albeit without specifying exact troop numbers.\n27\n  Such \narrangements have allowed the UAE Armed Forces to assume a more realistic \ndelaying role\n28\n \u2013 should UAE territory be invaded, they can serve to slow down \nhostile forces until superpower reinforcements arrive.   \n \n Since the declaration of the War on Terror in September 2001 and the \nsubsequent American invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the UAE, or more exactly \nDubai with its advanced infrastructure, has been able to provide the western militaries \nwith an important regional base for their operations.  Although never publicly \nsupporting the United States on the same scale as Qatar and Bahrain, which between \nthem house an entire airwing of the US Air Force and the US Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet, in \naddition to a CIA base and an array of US special forces living in compounds,\n29\n the \nUAE has nevertheless discreetly made many of its facilities available and will soon \nhost a permanent French military base.  Ironically given the US Congress\u2019 hostility to \nthe Dubai Ports World Company\u2019s attempted takeover of a number of US ports in \nearly 2006,\n30\n Dubai\u2019s ports have proved indispensable in the War on Terror.

Significantly, Terminal 2 is one of the few airports in the \nworld that has regular flights to Baghdad and Kabul - offered by African Express, Al-\nIshtar, Jupiter, and other somewhat low-key airlines.  While some of the passengers \nare Iraqis or Afghanis hoping to visit their relatives, the bulk of the $400 seats are \nreserved for US military personnel or for employees of big contractors such as \nHalliburton.  Also lucrative have been Terminal 2\u2019s war-related freight facilities, with \ncargo space on such flights selling for about $2 per kilo, and with many commercial \ncompanies shipping US military goods (including armoured vehicles) via the \nterminal.  It has been alleged that US military personnel have been working out of the \nairport offices of a major multinational courier company so as to bypass Dubai\u2019s \ncustoms\u2019 regulations and thereby smooth the clearance process for such goods.  On a \nmore formal level, Abu Dhabi has made available its airbase in Al-Dhafrah to the US \nAir Force and to the CIA, with RQ-4 Global Hawk unmanned reconnaissance aircraft \nbeing stationed there and with KC-10 tanker aircraft using the base to support \noperations in Afghanistan.  Embarrassingly, in the summer of 2005 it was revealed \nthat U2 aircraft were also being serviced in Al-Dhafrah, following the crash landing \nof one of the spy planes on its return to Abu Dhabi from a mission in Afghanistan.  \nThe incident prompted the US Air Force to confirm that its 380\nth\n Air Expeditionary \nWing had been based there since 2002.\n38\n  In total, it is thought that there are currently \nover 100 US military personnel stationed in Al-Dhafrah.\n39\n \n                                                 \n38\n International Herald Tribune (22 June 2005). \n 14 \n \nIran \u2013 A History of Threats \n \n Dubai has historically enjoyed fairly warm relations with Iran, given that \nmany of its immigrant merchants are of Persian origin.  Iran has also long been the \nemirate\u2019s principal regional trading partner and Dubai chose to remain neutral in the \nIran-Iraq War.\n40\n  Nevertheless, for the federation as whole, the greatest external threat \nsince its inception - and therefore the UAE Armed Forces\u2019 greatest fear - has always \nbeen an attack from Iran.  Spanning over a century and three very different eras of \nPersian and Iranian administration, a number of islands belonging to Sharjah and Ra\u2019s \nal-Khaimah \u2013 the UAE\u2019s third and fourth most populous emirates - have been claimed \nand counter-claimed, and remain a source of great dispute between the UAE and Iran.  \nWorryingly, the largest of these islands is less than 60 miles from downtown Dubai, \nand is currently occupied by Iranian military personnel.  In many ways the UAE\u2019s \nmost recent efforts to solidify its western military umbrella and to improve its War on \nTerror collaboration have exacerbated this risk as the US continues to challenge \nTehran over its domestic energy policies.   \n \n During the mid-1880s, the Qajari Persian government expanded its influence \nto the southern coast of Iran and its soldiers occupied the formerly Arab-controlled \nmainland towns of Lingah, Junj, and Luft, in addition to several Arab inhabited \n                                                                                                                                            \n39\n Janes Defense Weekly (7 February 2007); Personal interviews with US diplomats, \nLondon, July 2006. \n40\n Davidson, Dubai, p.227. \n 15 \nislands in the lower Gulf, including Qishm and Sirri.\n41\n  Importantly, four smaller but \nstrategically located islands close to the Straits of Hormuz remained in Arab hands \nfollowing a British warning delivered to Tehran.\n42\n  Even so, by the end of the \nnineteenth century Persia had renewed its claims to Henjam, Abu Musa, Tunb al-\nKuhbra and Tunb al-Sughra,\n43\n with Britain finally appearing to acknowledge the \nQajari\u2019s new sphere of influence.   \n \nBy the late 1930s, with Persia\u2019s name changed to Iran, with nationalist \nsentiments running high, and with Britain concentrating on developments in Nazi \nGermany, Reza Shah was encouraged to switch his ambitions to Bahrain \u2013 a much \ngreater prize.  His son, Muhammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, maintained pressure on \nBahrain for many more years following his Anglo-Soviet assisted succession during \nthe Second World War, stating in his own book, \u2018Mission of My Country\u2019, that his \ndivine purpose was to be the saviour of both Iran and the Gulf.\n44\n  By the late 1960s, \nduring the period of federal negotiations preceding British withdrawal, the Iranian \nForeign Ministry even claimed that \u2018Iran has always been opposed to colonialism in \nall forms, and the so-called federation of the Gulf emirates, by annexing the island of \nBahrain to it, is considered a matter which cannot be acceptable to the Iranian \ngovernment.\u201945  However, by the time of Bahrain\u2019s declaration of independence in \n                                                 \n41\n Ibid. p.72. \n42\n John B.

Muhammad Reza Shah claimed this was a necessary action to prevent any \n\u2018unfriendly power\u2019 from gaining control of the Straits.53  Following a brief struggle \ninvolving some fatalities, the ruler of Sharjah\n54\n reluctantly agreed to allow Iran to \nestablish permanent bases on certain parts of Abu Musa in exchange for a financial \naid package of nine annual payments of about $2 million.\n55\n  Importantly, the more \nresolute ruler of Ra\u2019s al-Khaimah56 refused to come to an agreement over the Tunb \nislands, and the UAE duly reported all three islands to the United Nations, requesting \ninternational arbitration.  Since the formation of the Gulf Cooperation Council in \n1981 the liberation of these territories has remained a central component of the six \nmembers\u2019 foreign policy objectives, however in many ways Iran has managed to \nextend its control even further.\n57\n  Notably, in 1992 Iran reneged on its 1971 deal with \nSharjah, as Revolutionary Guards began to encroach further on Abu Musa\u2019s towns, \nrequesting all UAE nationals to obtain Iranian entry visas.\n58\n  In 1995 Iran forcibly \nrequired all residents to exit and then return through the island\u2019s Iranian port, and has \nsince then prevented teachers and other UAE public sector employees from re-\n                                                                                                                                            \n52\n Kelly, Britain and the Persian Gulf, pp.92-93. \n53\n See Walter Laquer, The Struggle for the Middle East (London: Routledge, 1969). \n54\n Sheikh Khalid bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi. \n55\n Tim Niblock (ed.), Social and Economic Development in the Arab Gulf (London: \nCroom Helm, 1980), pp.205-215; Van Der Meulen, \u2018The Role of Tribal,\u2019 p.238. \n56\n Sheikh Saqr bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi \n57\n Malcolm Peck, The United Arab Emirates: A Venture in Unity (Boulder: Westview, \n1986), p.120. \n58\n Van Der Meulen, \u2018The Role of Tribal,\u2019 p.238. \n 18 \nentering.\n59\n  Ominously, Iran has now also opened an airport, has built a town hall, is \nconstructing a university, and conducts numerous naval exercises in nearby waters.\n60\n   \n \n Today, further instability and skirmishes in the vicinity of the islands remain \nlikely should a beleaguered Iranian presidency need to rebuild national pride.  This \ncould hamper both Dubai and Sharjah\u2019s oil exports, especially given the close \nproximity of Sharjah\u2019s remaining Mubarak offshore oilfield.  Moreover, despite the \nfederal government\u2019s attempts to balance the United States and Iran by inviting \ndelegations from both countries to the UAE in the summer of 2007, by declaring to \nthe international media that \u2018UAE territories will never be used for security, \nintelligence, or military operations directed against Iran,\u201961 and by dispatching groups \nof sympathetic fact-finding clergy to Qom in Iran; any stray anti-ship missiles or \nIranian submarine activity in the event of a US-Iran conflict would nonetheless raise \ntanker insurance rates and thereby greatly harm the UAE\u2019s economy.62  Lastly, it is \nalso important to note that invasion itself, or missile strikes against targets on UAE \nsoil are not an impossibility.  Certainly, there exists a certain optimism in the UAE \nthat the United States will eventually reach something of a \u2018grand bargain\u2019 with Iran, \nas the Americans cannot afford to allow the economies of the Gulf emirates to falter, \nespecially those such as Dubai\u2019s that are now so heavily reliant on foreign direct \ninvestment, much of which originates from the West.

ARAMCO devoted all of its scholarly \nresources to proving the legitimacy of the Saudi claim, not least by demonstrating that \nthe tribesmen of the area, including those inhabiting the Abu Dhabi-administered \ntown of Al-Ayn, had for centuries paid religious tax to Saudi sheikhs.\n69\n  Following a \nfailed peace conference in Damman in late 1952, a Saudi envoy\n70\n arrived in Hamasa, \nanother of the Buraimi towns, with an armed force laden with money, food, and \npresents for the local sheikhs.  To reinforce further the Saudi position, it was reported \nthat the envoy even married the daughter of the sheikh of one of the most powerful \nBuraimi tribes.\n71\n  Although the Trucial Oman Levies were deployed and the Saudis \n                                                 \n67\n For example Sheikh Said bin Tahnun Al-Nahyan\u2019s assault on the Wahhabis in \nBuraimi in 1848, and Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al-Nahyan\u2019s spirited defence of \nBuraimi against the Omani-Wahhabi renegade, Said Turki in 1870.

Just three years later Saudi Arabia was accused of \npaying for the assassination of the Abu Dhabi ruler,\n73\n and in 1959 Saudi Arabia \nvigorously protested over Abu Dhabi\u2019s establishment of a police outpost on the \ndisputed Khor al-Udaid.\n74\n \n \n Remarkably, when the UAE was formed in 1971 Saudi Arabia refused to \nacknowledge its existence, and only granted it recognition in 1974 when Abu Dhabi \nfinally agreed to give up Khor al-Udaid in addition to the islands of Khor Duwayham \nand Huwayat, thereby providing Saudi Arabia with a corridor of land to the lower \nGulf between Qatar and Abu Dhabi.  Ironically, while oil has never been discovered \nin the Buraimi region, this conceded territory is now home to the Shaiba and Zarara \noilfields, and is therefore one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s most resource rich provinces.75  \nImportantly, given that this 1974 treaty was never officially registered, there remains \nsome concern even today that the new generation of Abu Dhabi rulers may attempt to \nchallenge Saudi Arabia over the agreement.\n76\n  Most maps produced in Abu Dhabi \n                                                 \n72\n Ibid. p.160. \n73\n Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan Al-Nahyan. \n74\n Hawley, The Emirates, p.104. \n75\n Muhammad Fahim, From Rags to Riches: A Story of Abu Dhabi (London: Centre \nfor Arab Studies, 1995), p.159; John Duke Anthony, Arab States of the Lower Gulf: \nPeople, Politics, Petroleum (Washington DC: Middle East Institute, 1975), pp.148-\n149. \n76\n Van Der Meulen, \u2018The Role of Tribal,\u2019 p.23. \n 22 \ntoday depict the UAE with its pre-1974 Saudi border,\n77\n perhaps indicating a \nwillingness to re-open the dispute.

While in most cases the UAE has been a victim of \ncross-fire due to its unfortunate geographic location and its large expatriate \npopulation, it is important to note that a number of these incidents were also \npurposely intended to discredit the establishment and the ruling families, often by \nhighlighting their close relationship with the West.\n79\n   \n \n The first organised attacks that were aimed at destabilising the lower and \nfrightening both the British and the indigenous population were those launched by \n                                                 \n77\n Oxford Business Group, \u2018Emerging Emirates,\u2019 p.20; Personal interviews with \nacademic observers, Dubai (June 2006). \n78\n Davidson, Dubai, pp.41-43. \n79\n Ibid. pp.193-206 \n 23 \nOmani terrorists in the late 1950s and early 1960s; most of whom were supporting the \nImam Ghalib against the government in Muscat,\n80\n and many of whom would join the \nmore conventional Dhofar Liberation Front later in the decade.  Crucially, it would \nseem that most of the protagonists were based in Dubai, as sympathisers provided \nthem with safe houses and in some cases even British travel documentation, so that \nthey could travel freely without their Omani papers.  Land mines were also stored in \nDubai, seemingly in cars belonging to associates of both the ruler of Sharjah,\n81\n and \nthe eldest son of the ruler of Ajman.\n82\n  Shockingly, in 1959 a three ton lorry \ntransporting Trucial Oman Scouts soldiers was blown up by one of these mines on the \nroad between Dubai and Buraimi,\n83\n and soon after a Land Rover was blown up in \nBuraimi itself.\n84\n  As panic spread, all motorists began to place sandbags on the \nfenders of their cars so as to better absorb such explosions.\n85\n  Throughout 1960 the \nterror attacks continued, and on one occasion a mine exploded on a private road \nbelonging to the ruler of the informally recognised sheikhdom of Mahadha.\n86\n  Most \n                                                 \n80\n Most of the terrorists were thought to be drawn from the Bani Harth and the Bani \nRiyam.

With little choice, after three days of threat-laden negotiations \nMuhammad had to grant the aircraft safe passage to Libya where all of the hijackers \nwere allowed to walk free.\n90\n  The following year a British Airways jet was hijacked \nby the PLO and also forced to land in Dubai, before being refuelled under similar \ncircumstances.\n91\n  In 1977 the UAE faced an even more difficult year with a Gulf Air \nflight bound for Muscat being hijacked and landed by an unknown team of terrorists, \nwith explosives being detonated in the offices of the Egyptian Airlines at Sharjah \nairport.\n92\n  And with a prominent Dubai national and the federal Minister of State for \nForeign Affairs\n93\n being assassinated by gunmen while escorting the Syrian foreign \nminister to Abu Dhabi airport.\n94\n  Most dramatically, towards the end of 1977 the \nBaader-Meinhof Gang chose to fly their hijacked Lufthansa jet with 91 passengers on \nboard to Rome and Bahrain, before finally demanding clearance from Dubai.  \nMuhammad was again able to confront the terrorists, delaying their departure for over \n48 hours.\n95\n  Crucially, this allowed a German commando team to position themselves \n                                                 \n90\n Wilson, Rashid\u2019s Legacy, pp.358-360. \n91\n Merchant International Group Strategic Research and Corporate Intelligence (25 \nAugust 2005). \n92\n Ibid. \n93\n Saif Said bin Ghubash. \n94\n Wilson, Rashid\u2019s Legacy, p.431. \n95\n Ibid. pp.429-431. \n 26 \naround Mogadishu airport where they stormed the jet upon its arrival in Somalia, \nkilling all of the hijackers and releasing all of the hostages.

The fear that this killing generated was enough to persuade the ruler of \nDubai to finally have plain clothes bodyguards around him during public \nappearances.\n98\n  By the mid-1980s little had improved, with bombs being discovered \nonboard a Jordanian aircraft in Dubai in 1985, and with bombs exploding at the \nSyrian Airlines office at Abu Dhabi airport in 1986.  More recently, in the 1990s \nseveral foreign intelligence operatives were assassinated in the UAE, including an \nIranian intelligence colonel.  And in early 1999 explosives were discovered in one of \nDubai\u2019s first large-scale shopping malls: Deira City Centre.99  Infamously, on the \nChristmas Eve of that year yet another aircraft was diverted to the emirate when \nPakistani hijackers seized an Indian Airlines flight en route from Nepal to Delhi.

Certainly, in addition to well documented money laundering services\n101\n \nand the personal involvement of UAE nationals in Al-Qaeda\u2019s international attacks, \nincluding the Ra\u2019s al-Khaimah national Marwan Al-Shehhi, and another of the \nSeptember 11\nth\n hijackers, Fayez Banihammad,\n102\n there have also been persistent \nclaims that the country has many key sympathisers, and is regularly used as a safe \nhaven and a logistical base by various Al-Qaeda cells and other associated renegades.  \nDuring the September 11\nth\n Commission hearings the former US Secretary of \nDefence\n103\n stated that in 1999 the witness reports of paid agents in Afghanistan had \ninformed the CIA that Osama bin Laden had set up a large hunting camp in the desert \nof the Helmand province complete with marquees, generators, and refrigerators.  \nHoping to hit the suspected mastermind of the 1998 African embassy bombings, the \nPentagon duly drew up plans for a cruise missile strike, but then had to abort the \noperation when it was learned that a C130 transport aircraft with UAE markings had \nlanded at the camp\u2019s airstrip.

In a good example of carefully timed \nannouncements of sensitive information, it was only revealed a month later that a \u2018top \nten\u2019 Al-Qaeda operative had been captured in Dubai.

Along with \nother Gulf states there have been accusations that various terrorist organisations have \nbeen \u2018bought off\u2019.115  In 2005 the struggling Iraqi President, Jalal Talabani, made dark \nreferences to the sources of the funding for his enemies, most conspicuously the \ninsurgent leader Abu Musab Al-Zaraqawi.  Disturbingly, he stated that \u2018\u2026they are \ngetting aid from Al-Qaeda and from some financiers among some extremist Muslim \norganisations abroad\u2026 and from countries that I will not name.\u2019  Analysts agreed that \nthese mystery countries were most likely to be the small Gulf states.\n116\n  With specific \n                                                 \n113\n China Daily (9 August 2004). \n114\n Davidson, Dubai, pp.114-115. \n115\n Senior Qatari officials were recently alleged to have been paying a multi-million dollar annual \nransom to Al-Qaeda since 2003 so as to prevent attacks taking place on Qatari territory.  Khaleej \nTimes (4 May 2005). \n116\n Reuters (9 May 2005). \n 31 \nregard to the UAE, it has similarly been claimed that a number of Islamist \norganisations, in addition to wealthy individuals, are supporting terror organisations \nfinancially.\n117\n  However, regardless of whether these payments are in genuine support \nof the causes or are simply protection money, it would seem unnecessary for the UAE \nto have to rely on such measures given that at present most groups continue to benefit \nfrom Dubai\u2019s openness so long as they can operate in relative freedom and can use the \ncity\u2019s infrastructure for their own purposes.  Certainly, even if one does subscribe to \nthe belief that there exists some kind of unwritten understanding that the authorities \nwill turn a blind eye to questionable activities, or even if one accepts that Dubai \nunwittingly permits itself to be used as a logistical terror hub, these steps are unlikely \never to be enough to prevent splinter groups or disaffected individuals from acting \nunilaterally against an establishment that they undoubtedly perceive to be an ally of \nthe western powers. \n \n Over the last few years there have been a large number of threats made to \nDubai and the UAE by hitherto unknown groups, many of which refer explicitly to \nthe country\u2019s dealings with the United States and its supporting role in the War on \nTerror.  Notably, in 2002 a letter signed by the previously unknown \u2018Al-Qaeda \nTerrorist Organisation in the United Arab Emirates Government\u2019 was intercepted by \nUS intelligence services - it warned UAE officials to stop arresting Al-Qaeda\u2019s \n\u2018mujahideen sympathisers\u2019.  The letter concluded with a boast that \u2018\u2026you are well \naware that we have infiltrated your security, censorship, and monetary agencies along \nwith other agencies that should not be mentioned\u2019, and demanded that the UAE \u2018\u2026get \n                                                 \n117\n Personal interviews, Beirut (November 2006). \n 32 \nthe idolaters out.\u2019118  Similarly, in 2003, following the Anglo-American invasion of \nIraq an audio message was recorded by Al-Qaeda\u2019s Saleh Al-Aloofi that sought to \nincite violence in all of the pro-western Gulf states, including the UAE, by stating \n\u2018\u2026to the brothers of Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, the Emirates, and to all the lions of jihad \nin the countries neighbouring Iraq, every one of us has to attack what is available in \nhis country of soldiers, vehicles, and airbases of the crusaders and the oil allocated for \nthem.\u2019119  Chillingly, since 2005 the frequency and severity of the threats would seem \nto have increased even further, with underground Islamist websites having publishing \nwarnings that \u2018Dubai is rapidly changing into a secular state\u2026 with the profound use \nof non-Islamic ways\u2019;120 with Al-Qaeda representatives having notified the Dubai \nauthorities that they had discovered both the USS Harry Truman and the USS John \nKennedy berthed in Port Jebel Ali after they had been used to \u2018bombard the Muslims \nin Iraq and Afghanistan\u2019;121 with the US Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the US Consulate \nin Dubai having had to close temporarily due to bomb threats;\n122\n and with another \nnew group calling itself \u2018The Al-Qaeda Organisation in the Emirates and Oman\u2019 \nhaving issued a statement in July 2005 that called for the dismantling of all US \nmilitary installations in the UAE within ten days, failing which \u2018the ruling families \n                                                 \n118\n Paraphrased from unclassified document AFGP\/2002\/603856 located at the \nCombating Terrorism centre at the US Military Academy at West Point.

This is especially true given that the economic diversification \nstrategies, while superficially successful in reducing the historical dependency on oil \nexports, have, if anything, intensified the dependency on foreign economies.  Notably, \nin the event of a crisis - whether a terrorist attack, an invasion, or close proximity to \nregional violence - many of the multinationals with regional branches in Jebel Ali, \nDubai Internet City, Dubai Media City, and the various other free zones would most \nlikely withdraw their personnel and close their operations, and would think carefully \nabout returning afterwards.  Given the success of Dubai\u2019s free zones, other regional \ncities have set up similar entities,\n125\n and these are soon likely to position themselves \nas serious alternatives.  Problems in Dubai or elsewhere in the UAE would therefore \nlead to swift relocations for many companies that wished to maintain a Middle \nEastern headquarters.  Similarly, international luxury tourists would be unlikely to \ncontinue visiting the UAE should its reputation wane as being a safe destination.  \nMany of the European and North American tourists (who now make up nearly 40 \n                                                 \n123\n Personal correspondence (March 2007). \n124\n Financial Times (16 June 2008). \n125\n Jordan\u2019s Aqaba free zone was set up in 2000. \n 34 \npercent of all visitors to Dubai\n126\n) who choose their holidays from high street travel \nagency brochures do not really consider Dubai to be part of the Middle East.  But if \nthere were to be negative publicity, this misconception would swiftly change.  \nCertainly in October 2001 most of Dubai\u2019s five star hotels were empty following the \nUS invasion of Afghanistan, with even the iconic Burj Al-Arab having had its power \ncut off temporarily due to zero occupancy.  Tellingly, 2001 was the only year that the \ntotal number of visitors to Dubai did not increase, despite the sector\u2019s strong \nperformance in the months prior to September 11\nth\n.\n127\n  Given the much greater and \nmore diverse population of tourists today, it is likely that demand would be even more \nelastic should there be a future problem that more directly concerns the UAE, \nespecially as there are many alternative winter sun resorts, most of which offer \narguably far superior cultural and historical attractions than those of the lower Gulf.  \nSimilarly, should confidence in Dubai\u2019s real estate sector be shaken by internal or \nexternal threats, then a significant proportion of foreign investors would cease further \npayments and would probably try to sell their deposits, preferring to cut their losses.  \nIn much the same way as the emerging competition from new free zones, other \ndeveloping states are now beginning to adopt elements of Dubai\u2019s real estate industry \n                                                 \n126\n In 2006 there were 2 million European visitors and 0.4 million North American \nvisitors, out of a total of 6.4 million.  Data supplied by the Dubai Department of \nTourism and Commerce Marketing, 2007. \n127\n The Dubai Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing reported 3.5 million \nvisitors in 2001, compared to 3.4 million in 2000. \n 35 \nin an attempt to emulate its success.\n128\n  Should the pioneer stumble these are likely to \nprovide attractive alternative venues for international property investors. \n \n                                                 \n128\n In addition to Oman and some of the other Gulf states, prominent examples would \ninclude Cape Verde which has invested heavily in tourist infrastructure (including a \nnew international airport), and has recently launched a real estate sector modelled on \nsimilar lines to Dubai\u2019s. \n"}
