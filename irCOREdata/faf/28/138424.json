Examples have included the loss\nof several transatlantic flights from Glasgow in the mid 1990s and the more recent\ncollapse of Duo\u2019s network of international services from Edinburgh in May 2004.\nApart from Ryanair, major UK-based low cost airlines have chosen not to establish\n1 Fax 01234 752207, r.pagliari@cranfield.ac.uk\n2networks of international services at Scottish airports, preferring instead to expand at\nairports located in other regions of the UK. These developments have helped\ncontribute to a widespread perception amongst policy-makers that Scotland is poorly\nserved with direct international connections and that this may have adverse\nimplications for the performance and competitiveness of the Scottish economy,\nparticularly in its ability to attract inward investment (Mackinlay, 1999). For\nmultinational corporations, air services can have a direct impact on the\ncompetitiveness of internationally focussed businesses through the facilitation of better\ncustomer and supplier relationships (Hughes, 2004).\nIt is within this context that the aim of this paper is to evaluate developments in the\nprovision of direct international air services from airports in Scotland. The following\ntwo key questions will be addressed:\n\uf0b7 How has the level and pattern of direct international air services changed\nhistorically at Scottish airports?\n\uf0b7 What factors have shaped the provision of direct air services and to what extent\nhave they constrained or enhanced connectivity?\n2 Current level of air service provision\nScotland has a population of approximately five million, with the majority residing\nin the cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow (See Figure 1). Scheduled international air\nservices are offered at four airports, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Prestwick 2.\nThe busiest is Glasgow, which handled 8.1 million passengers in 2003, followed by\nEdinburgh, which handled 7.4 million. The third busiest is Aberdeen, which handled\n2 Norwegian carrier Wideroe operated a twice-weekly service in Summer 2004 between Sumburgh\n(Shetland Islands) and Oslo.\n32.5 million, while 1.8 million passengers passed through Prestwick. Aberdeen,\nEdinburgh and Glasgow are owned and operated by BAA Scotland (subsidiary of\nBAA), while Prestwick airport is owned by New Zealand-based utilities company,\nInfratil.\nGlasgow primarily functions as the principal gateway for both long-haul scheduled\nand international charter services in Scotland. It\u2019s closest competitor is Prestwick,\nwhich is located 56 km to the South of the city and is home to Ryanair\u2019s Scottish hub,\nwhere international \u201cno-frills\u201d services are offered to the secondary airports of several\nmajor European cities. At Edinburgh Airport, which serves Scotland\u2019s capital city,\ndirect scheduled services are offered by various regional airlines to several European\ngateway airports, while the importance of the oil industry to Aberdeen is apparent in\nthe range of services that are scheduled to airports in the North Sea region. Table 1\nlists the top fifteen international routes in terms of 2003 passenger traffic volume.\nAmsterdam, Dublin, Frankfurt and Paris are the dominant passenger markets.\n3 Analysis of changes in the supply of direct international scheduled services\n1988-2003\nFigure 2 shows the number of international destinations served with direct non-stop\nservices at the four airports between 1988 and 2004 3. Prior to 1990, Glasgow and\nPrestwick functioned as Scotland\u2019s international gateway airports, the former\nfocussing on short-haul services and the latter serving the transatlantic market. In\n1990, the removal of traffic distribution rules, which granted Prestwick Airport\nexclusive gateway status on transatlantic routes from Scotland, expedited the transfer\n3 Direct services are defined as those connections that are non-stop and do not involve a stop to set down\nand pick up passengers nor a change of aircraft at an intermediate airport.\n4of Air Canada and Northwest Airlines scheduled services to Glasgow. This was\nfollowed by the launch of new direct transatlantic flights from Glasgow offered by\nAmerican Airlines (Chicago), British Airways (New York JFK) and United Airlines\n(Washington). All of these services were subsequently withdrawn or reduced to\nseasonal operations by the late 1990s.\nScheduled services were resumed at Prestwick in 1994 when it was selected as\nRyanair\u2019s Scottish base 4. The low cost carrier selected Prestwick after managing to\nsecure a five-year exemption from paying aeronautical charges (Calder 1994).\nInternational services were further expanded after 1999 with the launch of direct\nflights to the secondary airports of several European cities 5. Although Prestwick is\ndisadvantaged relative to Glasgow in terms of distance from key population centres,\nthis is to some extent offset by the availability of a direct rail connection. In\npromoting its services, Ryanair used Prestwick\u2019s rail network accessibility to its\nadvantage by offering free rail travel from any station in Scotland on purchase of a\nRyanair ticket. These incentives combined with the marketing and availability of\nattractive fares enabled Ryanair to expand at Prestwick at the expense of Glasgow,\nwhere there was a decline in the number of short-haul international direct services\nbetween 1994 and 2002. During this period, the airport lost direct services to\nBrussels (Sabena), Frankfurt (Lufthansa) and Paris CDG (Air France).\nWhile Glasgow has struggled in developing and sustaining short-haul connections,\nit has established itself as the preferred Scottish gateway for long-haul services, all\noffered by non-UK based carriers (Air Canada, Air Transat, American, Continental,\n4 Initial destinations served were Dublin and London Stansted.\n5 Barcelona (Gerona), Brussels (Charleroi), Frankfurt (Hahn), Gothenburg (City), Milan (Bergamo),\nOslo (Sandefjord) Paris (Beauvais), Rome (Ciampino), Stockholm (Skavsta).\n5Emirates, US Airways, Zoom). In contrast, British Airways struggled to maintain\nviable long-haul services from Glasgow. One of the few direct service initiatives\nundertaken by the airline was the link to New York JFK, which was launched in 1992.\nThe carrier eventually withdrew services in 1998 after failing to attract sufficient\nvolumes of business traffic. The viability of the route was further compromised by the\nabsence of connecting flights offered to US destinations beyond New York, which\nwould have been possible had its proposed alliance with American Airlines been\napproved (Kemp 1998). Lack of business traffic likewise contributed to the demise of\ndirect services to Boston (Northwest Airlines) and Washington (United Airlines).\nContinental Airlines, in contrast, has managed to sustain a very successful year-round\nNew York Newark service since 1998. The US-based carrier offers the advantage of\nconnections through its Newark hub to a wide range of destinations in North and\nCentral America (Stokes, 1998). While Edinburgh managed to secure a daily\nContinental flight to Newark in June 2004, Glasgow continues to be the preferred\ngateway for long-haul services attracting direct services to Dubai (Emirates)\nPhiladelphia (US Airways) and Toronto (Air Canada).\nIn contrast to Glasgow, the number of international direct flights from Aberdeen\nremained generally stable during the 1990s. During this period, the airport sustained\nlinks to Amsterdam, Bergen, Esbjerg and Stavanger. Since 2002, Dublin (Ryanair),\nGroningen (bmi regional) and Paris CDG (Air France) have been added to its network\nof international destinations.\nAlthough the number of direct connections from Glasgow appears to have\nimproved after 2002, a high proportion of these new services were mainly to\ndestinations in the long-haul (e.g. Dubai) and Southern European holiday markets (e.g.\n6Alicante, Palma). Furthermore, in both markets, a high proportion of services were\nscheduled for the summer season and offered at low levels of service frequency (e.g.\ntwice\u2013weekly). Seasonal low frequency flights offered to mainly holidaying\npassengers resident in Scotland will be of marginal benefit to the Scottish economy\nwhereas high frequency services to the global network hubs of major international\nairlines will help sustain economic development and attract additional inward\ninvestment though facilitating accessibility to markets and suppliers.\nFigure 3 shows the number of gateway destinations served with a year round non-\nstop service operating at a frequency of greater than four flights per week from each\nScottish airport during the period 1988 to 2004 6. During this period, Glasgow was\nreplaced by Edinburgh as the preferred Scottish gateway for full service airlines\noffering direct services to hub airports in Europe. To a significant extent, regional\nsubsidiary carriers operating services on behalf of major network airlines such as Air\nFrance have facilitated the growth of direct air services offered at Edinburgh.\nAccording to Denton and Dennis (2000), for network carriers it has become more\ncommercially expedient to serve regional markets through sub-contracting routes to\nregional carriers who, with lower costs and more appropriate aircraft types, are better\nable to operate these services commercially. Network carriers are therefore able to use\nregional airlines to maintain their brand in low volume markets and to feed passengers\nonto their more profitable long-haul services. Passengers also, in theory should be\nable to receive the same service standards and benefits that would have been enjoyed\nhad the service been operated directly by the network carrier. As shown in Table 2, of\n6 Gateways are defined as being those airports that process greater than five million passengers per year.\nThis is consistent with the European Commission\u2019s definition of an international connection point.\n(European Union, 1996).\n7the eighteen direct high frequency routes scheduled to European gateway airports from\nScotland in June 2004, seven were operated exclusively by regional subsidiary carriers\nand two routes were operated by regional subsidiary carriers in competition with low\ncost airlines. Network carriers (CSA Czech Airlines, Aer Lingus, Icelandair, SAS)\nonly offered services on four routes. This is in contrast to June 1992, where out of the\neleven direct routes to European gateways, eight were operated by network carriers\nand the remaining three by an independent regional airline (Air UK).\nThe advantages to be gained by the regional airline in operating air services on\nbehalf of a major network carrier could be applied to the circumstances surrounding\nthe collapse of Duo and its Edinburgh services in May 2004. The airline under its\nprevious name (Maersk Air UK) functioned as a British Airways regional franchise\ncarrier based at Birmingham. The benefits of this arrangement included the\nconsiderable marketing advantages and cost savings involved in securing access to the\nfrequent flyer programme and sales distribution networks of British Airways. Re-\nmodelling itself as an independent airline, Duo sought to position itself as a \u201clower\ncost airline\u201d offering a level of service in addition to that generally provided by\ntraditional \u201cno-frills\u201d carriers. According to a former senior manager, the airline\u2019s\nbusiness plan was flawed because it adopted a direct sales strategy rather than using a\nglobal distribution system and insufficient funds were budgeted for advertising,\nespecially in non-UK markets where brand awareness was poor (Clarke, 2004).\nRyanair remains the dominant UK-based low cost airline offering direct\ninternational services in the Scottish market. In addition to securing first-mover\nadvantage in the market, the carrier was also able to develop more successfully using\nthe lower cost platform available at Prestwick where charges were substantially less\n8than at BAA Scotland\u2013owned Glasgow and management appearing to be much more\namenable to the Ryanair business proposition. In contrast, Easyjet turned-down the\nopportunity to establish a Scottish base because it was unable to reach agreement with\nBAA Scotland on airport charges.\n4 Key factors\n4.1 Social and economic factors\nOne of the underlying drivers of direct international air services provision is the\nscale and spatial distribution of business and leisure travel demand.\nBusiness passengers are particularly attractive to scheduled airlines as they tend to\ntravel more frequently and are also generally prepared to pay higher prices than leisure\ntravellers (Shaw, 1985). A region\u2019s demand for business air travel is determined by\nthe presence of sectors of the economy that are frequent users of air services.\nAccording to Mason (2004), banking and finance followed by insurance and pension\nfunds are the most \u2018air intensive\u2019 sectors. Analysis of Scottish air traffic demand\nshowed that employment in \u2018air intensive sectors\u2019 was greater within Edinburgh\nairport\u2019s catchment area compared to Glasgow\u2019s (Department for Transport, 2003a).\nTable 3 shows the higher proportion of economic activity accounted for by banking\nand finance in Edinburgh, in particular the role of foreign-based institutions.\nEdinburgh\u2019s dual role as a major financial centre (sixth largest in Europe) and centre\nof public administration in Scotland helps explain why some full service carriers, such\nas Air France and Lufthansa prefer to operate from Edinburgh rather than Glasgow.\nThe advantage enjoyed by Edinburgh is also reflected in an analysis of the location\nand ownership of foreign companies that have invested in Scotland. For example,\nthere are 268 foreign companies located within Edinburgh airport\u2019s catchment area\n9compared to 91 in Glasgow\u2019s. There are a further 150 companies located in\nLanarkshire where both airport catchment areas overlap. Export trends will also\naffect patterns of business travel between regions. While the value of manufactured\nexports produced by companies located in both catchment areas is similar, service\nsector exports (e.g. financial services) are much more significant from companies\nlocated within Edinburgh\u2019s catchment area (Department for Transport, 2003b).\nTourism, both outbound and inbound, is also a significant driver in both the scale\nand geographic location of direct international services. In the short-haul market, a\nsignificant proportion of outbound tourism to international destinations has historically\nbeen in the form of package holidays with flights operated by charter rather than\nscheduled carriers. Increased demand for seat-only travel in recent years has\nprompted low cost carriers to offer services to several major European cities and\nholiday resorts. Rather than operate from Edinburgh, with its larger catchment area,\nRyanair opted for Prestwick where the emphasis appears to have been on securing\nfavourable terms and conditions from the airport operator. Seat-only services are also\noffered by Air Scotland and Flyglobespan to both Mediterranean resorts (Alicante,\nMalaga, Palma) and some major European cities (Athens, Barcelona, Rome). Both\ncarriers have avoided head-to-head competition with Ryanair at Prestwick and instead\nare offering services from Edinburgh and Glasgow. However, on most of these routes\nfrequency is limited to weekly or twice weekly services.\nScotland is an important tourist destination, attracting 1.6 million overseas visitors\nin 2003 with 82% travelling by air. Of those visitors that arrive by air, 55% used\ndirect scheduled services to Scottish airports, with the remaining 45% having arrived\nand departed on connecting flights. The most visited city is Edinburgh, where four\n10\nout of the top five tourist attractions are located. The most important overseas market\nis the US, which accounts for 26% of visitors. Although Edinburgh appears to host\nmost of the tourist attractions, the majority of direct services from the US are\nscheduled from Glasgow. This is because; firstly, being the busiest airport, Glasgow\nhas historically tended to be perceived by the airline industry as Scotland\u2019s principal\ninternational gateway, and secondly, facilities for handling large narrow body aircraft\n(Boeing 767) on long-haul services are more extensive in Glasgow compared to\nEdinburgh.\nIn the short-haul market, which is dominated by visitors from Germany, France and\nItaly, Edinburgh appears to be the more preferred gateway for several carriers\nprimarily catering for the tourist market such as Germanwings, Hapag-Lloyd Express\nand SAS (seasonal service). With user charges very similar at Edinburgh and\nGlasgow the only added value offered by the former is its proximity to key tourist\nattractions, and from the perspective of developing the outbound leisure market, a\ngreater population catchment area compared to both Glasgow and Prestwick airports.\n4.2 Use of regional jets\nAir service networks are shaped to a significant extent by the operating capabilities\nand economics of aircraft technology. The introduction of regional jets in the thirty to\nfifty-seat category has enabled airlines to operate routes that were previously too long\nin terms of sector distance for conventional turboprops and too thinly trafficked to\nsupport a Boeing 737-series aircraft. Fifty-seat regional jets such as the Bombardier\nCRJ-200 and Embraer ERJ-145 have sufficient range to operate routes which by-pass\nhub airports. The Embraer ERJ series, which includes the smaller ERJ-135, are to be\nfound in the fleets of increasing number of European regional airlines (e.g. bmi\n11\nregional,). Aberdeen - Paris CDG and Edinburgh - Paris CDG are examples of\nmarkets where regional jets replaced larger-sized aircraft, substituting single daily\nfrequencies with schedules offering three daily return trips. For example, in the early\n1990s Air France operated a daily Aberdeen-Paris CDG direct service using a Boeing\n737-200, which involved an intermediate stop at Glasgow. This service was\neventually withdrawn in 1992. Ten years later, Air France resumed direct services,\noffering a three-times daily service using an Embraer-135 operated by R\u00e9gional\nAirlines under a franchise agreement. On busier markets, however, such as Dublin\nand Amsterdam, it is common to find Boeing 737-series jets, which are generally\nassociated with lower unit costs and also often used by low cost airlines (Easyjet and\nRyanair).\n4.3 Absence of base carrier and availability of connecting services\nThe presence of a base carrier or national airline will have an impact on the range\nand volume of international connections that are offered. When air transport was\nheavily regulated and subsidised, governments ensured that their country had access to\ninternational destinations through establishing a national air carrier. The national\ncarrier would often have been granted exclusive rights as the designated flag airline to\nserve international destinations under bilateral air service agreements. Therefore,\ncountries with relatively small population sizes such as Iceland, Malta and the\nRepublic of Ireland ensured access to other countries through services provided by the\nnational airline, which was often state-owned and subsidised. However, deregulation\nin the 1990s and the gradual withdrawal of state aid has to a large extent called into\nquestion the commercial sense in the flag carriers of smaller states (Olympic Airways,\nSabena, Swiss) maintaining over-extended route networks inherited from a period of\n12\ncharacterised by limited competition and regular subsidy.\nPrior to deregulation, UK bilateral international air service agreements usually\ndesignated British Airways as the UK carrier. Furthermore, the same agreements\nwould sometimes limit international services to operating from London Heathrow.\nThis restricted the ability of airlines to develop networks of international air services at\nUK regional airports, at least up until the late 1980s.\nWhile deregulation has enabled direct services to flourish at many UK regional\nairports, Scottish airports have to some extent been disadvantaged because of their\ngeographic location. Situated on Europe\u2019s Northwestern periphery, carriers such as\nBritish Airways, bmi and Flybe have found it more commercially expedient to serve\nthe Scottish international market through offering connecting flights between Scotland\nand Continental Europe via Birmingham, Manchester or London Heathrow. The\ndevelopment of the \u2018Eurohub\u2019 at Birmingham in the early 1990s by British Airways\nwas an attempt to develop a \u2018hub and spoke\u2019 network where services to various\nEuropean airports from Birmingham would be closely coordinated with feeder flights\nfrom Scotland and Northern Ireland with short connection times between services.\nDuring this period some direct flights from Scotland were withdrawn and replaced by\nconnecting services, some of them marketed as direct flights. For example, British\nAirways withdrew its daily non-stop Glasgow-Paris CDG service in 1995 replacing it\nwith several direct flights all involving an intermediate stop en route at Birmingham,\nleading to a significant increase in overall travel time between both cities.\nConsolidating traffic through a hub airport allows for a higher frequency service to\nbe offered which is of particular appeal to business passengers. Leisure passengers\nwill also benefit in some instances from lower fares offered by connecting carriers.\n13\nFirstly, economies of density and the use of larger aircraft on hub and spoke networks\nmean lower unit costs (Lijesen et al, 2002). Secondly, connecting carriers, in seeking\nto improve load factors on specific flight segments, may offer substantially discounted\nfares on a limited range of seats to passengers connecting from other airports in the\nnetwork.\nThe absence of base carriers of significant size has meant that Scottish airports have\ntended to function as spokes rather than hubs within airline networks. Under these\ncircumstances services are much more susceptible to withdrawal in contrast to the\nstability and expansion of services that is often a feature of base carriers that have\nsubstantial sunk investments and established operations at an airport.\n4.4 Airport Competition\nBAA Scotland\u2019s control of Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow has been cited as\none of the main contributory factors behind the decline and stagnation of international\nair service provision at Glasgow (Currie, 2002). Market dominance in the airport\nsector can be manifested in operator inflexibility in setting levels of airport\naeronautical charges. Go, prior to its takeover by Easyjet, and Easyjet itself have made\nfrequent reference to the high level of aeronautical charges levied at Edinburgh and\nGlasgow, citing this as the main barrier to establishing networks of services at these\nairports (Nichols, 2001). It has often been recommended that in order to facilitate a\ncompetitive environment, BAA Scotland\u2019s airports should be owned and operated\nindependently (Leask, 2002). Indeed, the sale of Prestwick airport by BAA in 1992\nand its subsequent growth and development perhaps serves as an example of the\npositive effects of greater airport competition.\nIn seeking to attract airlines, many airports offer incentives such as discounts on the\n14\nlevel of published aeronautical charges. Low cost airlines, given the nature of their\noperations and business model are likely to be the first carriers to react to pricing\ninitiatives given that airport user charges account for a fairly significant proportion of\ntheir total operating costs. Ryanair, for example in March 2004, transferred a\nproportion of capacity on their Dublin-Birmingham route to Nottingham in response to\nan increase in charges levied by Birmingham Airport. (Moores, 2004). The ease with\nwhich some carriers are able to transfer operations, perhaps suggests that the market\nfor airport access is highly elastic. However, elasticity depends on the type of airline.\nLong-haul and full service carriers may not react in the same way as low cost airline to\nprice changes as their choice of airport is also influenced by quality of airport facilities\nand surface accessibility. Actually, one low cost carrier Flyglobespan, decided to re-\nlocate from Prestwick to Glasgow because the latter airport was perceived as offering\nbetter value than the former in terms of US market recognition (Moores, 2003).\nThe initiative undertaken by BAA Scotland in 2002 to establish its own route\ndevelopment fund with an investment of \u20ac85 million perhaps suggests that the\ncompany is sufficiently incentivised to promote its airports without the need for\ncompetition. Indeed, in separating ownership and management, the three airports may\nlose the benefits of economies of scale where funds needed to finance capital\nexpenditure and marketing initiatives can be more readily facilitated through drawing\non the considerable financial resources of the BAA group.\n4.5 Government support for air services\nThe Scottish Executive has very few direct responsibilities for civil aviation in\nScotland. However, one significant initiative undertaken was the setting-up of a route\ndevelopment fund to help support new direct air services.\n15\nThe Interim Route Development Fund (IRDF) was established, with a budget of\naround \u20ac8.5 million in 2002. It is managed by Scottish Enterprise, which is a\ndevelopment agency sponsored by the Scottish Executive. Provided air service\ninitiatives are able to demonstrate that business links will be improved and additional\ninbound tourist traffic will be generated, the fund finances discounts on aeronautical\ncharges up to a maximum of 75% of passengers on each flight over a three-year\nperiod. The fund also requires a matching commitment from the airport operators.\nTable 4 shows that by June 2004 seven route initiatives were supported at\nEdinburgh, six at Prestwick and one each at Aberdeen, Glasgow, Inverness and\nKirkwall. Low cost carriers were involved in eight direct route initiatives, with the\nremaining nine operated by full service airlines. Ryanair has been the largest recipient\nof support securing assistance for six of its new routes from Prestwick. However, of\nthose routes supported by IRDF assistance, only nine have survived. Duo\u2019s five routes\nwere withdrawn following the collapse of the airline, while new services offered by\nGermania, Loganair and Snowflake were also discontinued.\nThe fact that a sizeable proportion of the initiatives supported by the fund have\nfailed perhaps serves to illustrate the limits of government start-up support where there\nare either flaws in the airline business proposition or there are risks to cash-flow and\nliquidity due to lower than expected traffic volumes. The precise levels of support\nawarded to each initiative are confidential, so it is difficult to ascertain whether levels\nof assistance were adequate. Analysis of the discontinued air services does show that\nthe majority were initiatives launched by new start-up carriers with limited experience\nof serving the Scottish market (Duo, Germania, Snowflake). Furthermore, it is\ninteresting to note that several of the new direct service initiatives undertaken since\n16\n2002 by major network carriers and their regional affiliates (Air France, CSA Czech\nAirlines, Lufthansa, SAS) have been sustained without IRDF support. Indeed, there\nmay even be an issue of whether it is more desirable to support start-up initiatives\nthrough subsidising marketing and promotional activities rather than on discounting\naeronautical charges. Experience of travel banks in the United States in supporting\nnew air service initiatives from regional airports perhaps suggests that market-based,\ndemand\u2013led solutions are more effective 7. However, this supposition is based on how\nhighly airlines value lower aeronautical charges relative to additional marketing and\npromotional activity. The fact that recurrent criticism of the level of aeronautical\ncharges set by BAA Scotland have been levelled by several air carriers perhaps\nsuggests that this is a primary hurdle to developing new air services in Scotland.\n5 Conclusions\nThe development of direct air services has historically been constrained by\nScotland\u2019s relatively low population size and remote location relative to Mainland\nEurope. The absence of established and significantly-sized base carriers has meant\nthat Scottish airports typically function as \u201cspokes\u201d within airline networks and are\nthus more susceptible to changes in levels of service. The geographic distribution and\nlevel of direct services has been shaped to a significant extent by the effects of air\nservice deregulation. The loss of Prestwick\u2019s exclusive transatlantic gateway status\nprecipitated the transfer of all long-haul services to Glasgow. Although some of these\nwere subsequently withdrawn, the airport has retained its status as Scotland\u2019s principal\ngateway for long-haul services. In the same period, Glasgow has not managed to\nretain its short-haul international connections.\n7 For a discussion of travel banks please refer to (General Accounting Office, 2003)\n17\nOne significant effect of deregulation has been the emergence of low cost carriers.\nRyanair, lured by generous terms and conditions, preferred to establish its network of\nshort-haul services at Prestwick where it now offers services to more European\ndestinations that Glasgow. While network carriers have struggled in sustaining\nservices from Glasgow, Edinburgh offers a more appealing business proposition where\nthe presence of the Scottish Parliament, a significant business and financial community\nand the city\u2019s tourist attractions offers greater scope to schedule commercially viable\nair services. However, as major network carriers have become progressively more\ndisengaged from operating in regional markets, the potential loss of air service\nconnections has been averted by the franchising of services to regional airlines. Lower\ncosts and the use of regional jets means that major hubs can be served with high levels\nof service frequency and flights can be scheduled to new destinations that could not be\nserved profitably using conventional jet and turboprop aircraft. Several major network\ncarriers have made use of regional franchise airlines and subsidiaries to operate high\nfrequency regional jet services from Edinburgh and to a lesser extent Aberdeen.\nThe improvement in the level and range of direct services scheduled after 2002 to a\nlarge extent has been due to the efforts of Prestwick Airport Ltd and BAA Scotland in\nmarketing and promoting their airports to potential airlines. It is unlikely that\nbreaking-up BAA Scotland into three separately owned and managed airports would\ncreate substantial benefits in terms of additional marketing and promotion. Indeed, the\nadvantages of drawing on the significant resources of the BAA group both for capital\nexpenditure and marketing support would in fact be lost. Less effective has been the\nmuch-vaunted Scottish Executive Route Development Fund where since its inception,\na significant number of supported initiatives have been withdrawn.\n18\nAcknowledgments\nThe author would like to express his gratitude to Dr George Williams for his advice\nand support and to Mr Kenny MacAskill MSP for his insightful and valuable\ncomments on initial drafts of this paper.\n19\nReferences\nCalder, C,. 1994.
