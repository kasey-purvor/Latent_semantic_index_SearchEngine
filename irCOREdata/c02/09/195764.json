Magnetospheric physics (Magnetopause, cusp,\narid boundary layers; Solar wind-magnetosphere interac-\ntions) \u2013 Ionosphere (Particle precipitation; Plasma convec-\ntion)\n1 Introduction\nIt has been well established that the orientation of the in-\nterplanetary magnetic field (IMF) plays an important role in\ncontrolling the dayside reconnection (e.g. Heppner, 1972;\nReiff and Burch, 1985; Moore et al., 2002), and thereby\nthe large-scale convection-driven flow patterns (e.g. Cow-\nCorrespondence to: H. Hu\n(hhq@pric.gov.cn)\nley, 1981; Khan and Cowley, 1999; Ruohoniemi and Baker,\n1998), together with the precipitation of magnetosheath par-\nticles into the magnetosphere and ionosphere via the magne-\ntospheric cusp region (e.g. Newell and Meng, 1992; Pinnock\net al., 1995; Sandholt et al., 1998; Milan et al., 1999, 2000).\nWhen the IMF is southward, reconnection at the low-\nlatitude magnetopause between the closed magnetospheric\nfield lines and the IMF field lines in the sheath, which has\nbeen referred to as low-latitude reconnection, results in the\nformation of open flux tubes, anti-sunward flow in the po-\nlar cap, twin-cell convection in the polar ionosphere, and a\nconcurrent expansion of the polar cap (Siscoe and Huang,\n1985; Cowley and Lockwood, 1992). Since impulsive day-\nside reconnection was first observed (Haerendel et al., 1978;\nVan Eyken et al., 1984; Goertz et al., 1985), it has been be-\nlieved to be the primary mechanism for the transfer of flux\nfrom the Earth\u2019s magnetosheath to the magnetosphere and\nepisodes of such flux transfer are referred to as flux trans-\nfer events (FTEs, Russell and Elphic, 1978). Several differ-\nent pulsed ionospheric signatures associated with FTEs have\nbeen studied in detail, such as the poleward moving auro-\nral forms (PMAFs) (e.g. Sandholt et al., 1998), rapid veloc-\nity transients or temporally enhanced flow velocities called\n\u201cflow channels\u201d or pulsed ionospheric flows (e.g. Pinnock et\nal., 1995; Yeoman et al., 1997; Provan et al., 1998; Milan et\nal., 1999, 2000; Lockwood et al., 2000; Davies et al., 2002),\npulsed large-scale convection associated with cusp auroral\ntransients (Moen et al., 1995), or poleward moving radar au-\nroral forms (Wild et al., 2001).\nWhen the IMF is northward, lobe reconnection, or high-\nlatitude reconnection between lobe field lines and the IMF\nbegins, resulting in a multi-celled flow pattern, with a region\nof sunward flow in the dayside polar cap (e.g. Dungey, 1963;\nRussell, 1972; Reiff and Burch, 1985; Bristow et al., 1998;\nSandholt et al., 2000, 2001), although observations in the\ndayside ionosphere suggest that open flux tube production\ndoes not switch off entirely until the clock angle falls below\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n2228 H.

Fields of view of the eight Northern Hemispheric Super-\nDARN radars overlaid on the potential map at 13:30 UT, the middle\ntime of the considered interval in this paper. This is plotted on a\ngeomagnetic grid from the pole to 60\u25e6, with 12 MLT at the top and\n18 MLT to the left. The data from the beams highlighted with blue\nlines will be studied in detail.\n\u223c30\u25e6\u201340\u25e6 (e.g. Sandholt et al., 1998). Moore et al. (2002)\nand Sandholt et al. (2003) found that subsolar reconnection\nwill weaken and disappear for nearly northward Bz. There\nhave been a wide range of proposed reconnection topologies\nthat might exist for IMF Bz northward (Dungey, 1963; Rus-\nsell, 1972; Cowley, 1981 and 1983; Crooker, 1992; Onsager\nand Lockwood, 1997; Lockwood and Moen, 1999; Sandholt\net al., 2000; Onsager et al., 2001), but there are only two ba-\nsic types. The first type is lobe reconnection, which takes\nplace only in one hemisphere, referred to as \u201clobe stirring\u201d\n(Reiff, 1982), or lobe reconfiguration, which results in circu-\nlatory lobe convection cells in the polar cap. Another type,\noften referred to as lobe merging, occurs first in one hemi-\nsphere and then the overdraped field lines reconnect in the\nopposite hemisphere. The flow cells with sunward polar cap\nflow now cross between the open and closed field line re-\ngions and do not remain in the region of open flux. Open\nflux thus may be converted to closed flux and the convec-\ntion flow streamlines in the merging cells cross the polar cap\nboundary. Flux is lost from the polar cap and hence, the polar\ncap shrinks.\nThere is no doubt about the existence of the lobe recon-\nnection resulting in sunward convection within the polar\ncap ionosphere (Maezawa, 1976), and \u201cfour-cell\u201d convection\n(Freeman et al., 1993), higher-latitude type 2 (north) auro-\nras (\u00d8ieroset et al., 1997) and \u201creverse\u201d cusp ion dispersion\nsignature (Matsuoka et al., 1996). However, some contro-\nversies remain over the temporal variability of the lobe re-\nconnection and the related convection signatures. For ex-\nample, the merging process has been believed to be quasi-\nstationary (e.g. Onsager et al., 1995; Fuselier et al., 2000;\nFrey et al., 2002, 2003; Chang et al., 2004), while Chisham\net al. (2004) noted reconnection potential with transient en-\nhancements. Lu et al. (2004) observed intermittent magnetic\nreconnection at the high-latitude magnetopause, and Provan\net al. (2005) suggested that the dayside reconnection rate was\nmodulated by variations in the solar wind dynamic pressure\nand the IMF Bz component.\nIn this paper we present a case study in which the IMF\nBz was strongly northward, a four-cell convection pattern\nand antisunward flow bursts were observed in the Northern\nHemisphere by SuperDARN and lasted for at least 1.5 h. A\nsimilar flow pattern and a reversed cusp ion dispersion sig-\nnature were also observed by DMSP satellites. It gives us\nan excellent opportunity to study the temporal variations of\nlobe reconnection and its associated ionospheric convection\nin detail.\n2 Instrumentation\n2.1 SuperDARN radar\nThe SuperDARN coherent HF radars (Greenwald et al.,\n1995) are designed to investigate field-aligned ionospheric\nplasma density irregularities (radar aurora) and large-scale\nionospheric convection. The spectral characteristics of\npower, line-of-sight Doppler velocity, and spectral width\n(Hanuise et al., 1993) can be derived from the auto-\ncorrelation function of the returned signals. The Doppler ve-\nlocity gives an estimate of the radar line-of-sight component\nof the plasma convection velocity (Ruohoniemi et al., 1987).\nLarge-scale maps of the high-latitude convection can be de-\nrived from multiple radars using the \u201cMap Potential\u201d analy-\nsis method developed by Ruohoniemi and Baker (1998). In\nthis method, the line-of-sight velocities are mapped onto a\npolar grid to determine a solution for the electrostatic po-\ntential, which is expressed in spherical harmonics, and the\nstatistical model of Ruohoniemi and Greenwald (1996), pa-\nrameterized by concurrent IMF conditions, is used to stabi-\nlize the solution where no data are available. In this study,\nan eighth-order spherical harmonic fit is employed to repre-\nsent the Northern Hemisphere data. The flow vectors are de-\nrived using the SuperDARN line-of-sight velocity measure-\nments and the transverse velocity component from the spher-\nical harmonic fit.\nDuring the period of interest, eight of the Northern Hemi-\nsphere radars were operated with excellent data coverage.\nFigure 1 shows the fields of view of the radars in Alti-\ntude Adjusted Corrected Geomagnetic (AACGM) coordi-\nnates (Baker and Wing, 1989), looking down on the geomag-\nnetic north pole at 13:30 UT, the middle time of the interval\nAnn.

Starting from the dusk side and moving clock-\nwise, the fields of view in the map are of Finland (F), Iceland\nEast (E), Iceland West (W), Goose Bay (G), Kapukasing (K),\nSaskatoon (T), Prince George (B) and Kodiak (A) radars.\nThe highlighted beams are beam 9 of the Finland (F) radar,\nbeam 5 of Iceland East (E) and beam 6 of Goose Bay (G),\nwhose data will be analysed in detail. During this interval,\nthe CUTLASS radars (F&E) covered the antisunward flow\nregion, while the Goose Bay radar covered the sunward flow\nregion. It should be noted, however, that the MLT locations\nof the fields of view of the radars changed over the inter-\nval. The fields of view extend over more than 18 h of mag-\nnetic local time, covering the whole dayside ionosphere with\nvery rich backscatter, which makes the potential map reli-\nable, especially for dayside convection. There was a gap of\nSuperDARN coverage in the evening sector where the IMF\nmodel data are used to stabilize the solution, which might\nhave some influence on nightside convection but no obvious\ninfluence on our results about dayside convection.\nOn 2 March 2002, all eight radars were operated in a stan-\ndard mode in which each radar scans through 16 beams of\nazimuthal separation 3.24\u25e6, with a 7 s dwell time for each\nbeam and a total scan time of 2 min. Each beam is divided\ninto 75 range gates of length 45 km, and so in each full\nscan the radars cover 52\u25e6 in azimuth and over 3000 km in\nrange. The CUTLASS components, Finland (F) and Iceland\nEast (E) radars, are stereo radars (Lester et al., 2004), which\nhave two identical channels. Channel A of these radars were\noperated in a standard mode, whereas Channel B was fixed\nin the beam directed towards Svalbard, namely beam 9 and\nbeam 6, respectively, giving a much higher time resolution of\n7 s compared to other beams. Although most of the South-\nern Hemispheric radars were also in operation during that\nperiod, they received very little ionospheric backscatter. It\nis thus difficult to derive the large-scale convection pattern\nusing SuperDARN data in the Southern Hemisphere to com-\npare with the Northern Hemisphere.\n2.2 DMSP particle and flow data\nMeasurements of ion and electron fluxes by the SSJ\/4 (Hardy\net al., 1984) and SSIES instruments on board the DMSP F13\nand F14 spacecraft have been employed to investigate the\npattern of particle precipitation and their relationship to the\nplasma flow. The DMSP spacecraft are in polar orbits (fixed\nin local time), sampling the ionospheric plasma at about\n840 km. F13 is in a roughly dawn-dusk orientation while F14\nis in 09:30\u201321:30 local time orientation. SSJ\/4 points toward\nzenith at all times, and provides 1 s resolution spectra of ion\nand electron flux between 30 eV and 30 keV, while SSIES\nprovides snapshot pictures of ionospheric convection during\nthe interval, allowing us to compare the flow characteristics\nin both hemispheres.\n2.3 ACE spacecraft\nUpstream interplanetary conditions for the period under\nstudy were monitored by the ACE spacecraft (Stone et al.,\n1998) located at GSM coordinates (X, Y,Z)=(225, \u201337, \u2013\n3) Re during this interval. The solar wind and the IMF are\nmeasured by the SWEPAM and MAG instruments, respec-\ntively (McComas et al., 1998; Smith et al., 1999). The time\nlag of field changes from ACE to the dayside ionosphere has\nbeen estimated to be 67\u00b15 min, using the algorithm of Khan\nand Cowley (1999). This estimate includes the propagation\ntime between ACE spacecraft and subsolar bow shock, the\ntransit time for the shocked and slowed solar wind across the\nsubsolar magnetosheath, and the Alfvenic propagation time\nalong open field lines from the subsolar magnetopause to the\ncusp ionosphere, in which solar wind proton number den-\nsity and speed are taken to be \u223c10 cm\u22123 and \u223c390 km s\u22121\nrespectively, and assuming that the reconnection occurred at\nthe subsolar magnetopause. During the interval of interest,\nthe active reconnection was at lobe field lines, and thus the\ntime lag is expected to be influenced by the polarity change\nin Bx and might be variable and underestimated.\n3 Observations\n3.1 Solar wind and IMF conditions\nOn 2 March 2002, IMF Bz and Bx are positive for the whole\nday except for some very short time negative excursions,\nwhich gives us a very good opportunity to study dayside re-\nconnection and associated ionospheric convection and parti-\ncle precipitation during a prolonged period of positive IMF\nBz. In Fig. 2 we present data from the ACE spacecraft,\nlagged by 67min via the method described above, from 12:00\nto 16:00 UT on 2 March 2002. This is an extended interval\ndescribing the upstream interplanetary conditions for 1 h on\neither side of the interval of specific interest, namely from\n13:00 to 15:00 UT, which is highlighted by the vertical solid\nlines. The top two panels show the solar wind proton num-\nber density and speed. The following three panels show the\nGSM components of the IMF. The clock and elevation an-\ngles of the field, defined as the angles of the IMF vector with\nGSM z axis in the y-z and z-x planes, respectively, are shown\nin the next two panels.\nIt is clear that the solar wind and IMF conditions had be-\ncome very stable during the main interval of interest, with\nvariable IMF restricted to about 20 min before. During\n13:00\u201315:00 UT, the solar wind proton number density and\nvelocity were about 10 cm\u22123 and 390 km s\u22121. IMF Bx was\npositive with an average value of 4 nT, while By was small\nand negative, and Bz was strongly positive with a very con-\nstant value of 10 nT.

Before the IMF changed\nfrom By dominant to Bz dominant at 12:40 UT, the convec-\ntion was dominated by a large circular dusk cell and crescent-\nshaped dawn flow cell, with flow enhancement in the post-\nnoon sector, which is consistent with the Dungey-cycle flow\ndriven in the presence of strong positive IMF By (Reiff and\nBurch, 1985; Ruohoniemi and Greenwald, 1996). As the\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2227\/2006\/ Ann. Geophys., 24, 2227\u20132242, 2006\n2232 H. Hu et al.: Dayside flow bursts and high-latitude reconnection\nIMF abruptly turned strongly northward around 12:40 UT,\nlocalised sunward flows began to appear within the polar cap,\nfirst appearing at the post-noon sector and then moving or\nexpanding to the pre-noon sector, consistent with the nega-\ntive turning of IMF By . The global convection pattern also\nchanged from a distorted two-cell into a multi-cell configu-\nration, and eventually a clear four-cell pattern at 13:00 UT.\nIn Fig. 3 we present four representative examples of the\nflow pattern, imaged at 13:00, 13:30, 14:00 and 14:28 UT,\nwhich employ 2-min resolution data from the eight radars\nindicated in Fig. 1. Figure 3 shows that the four-cell con-\nvection pattern and the sunward flows in the polar cap lasted\nfor at least 1.5 h, and also that there are some strong flow\nbursts occurring in the dayside post-noon sector (see the map\nat 13:30 UT).\nTo examine more closely the variability of the dayside\nflow, in the four bottom panels of Fig. 2, we extract parame-\nters from the Map Potential plots during 13:00\u201315:00 UT, in\nwhich horizontal dashed lines show the average values. Fig-\nure 2h shows the total transpolar voltage in the flow maps,\nwhich lies typically between\u223c15 and\u223c40 kV, and exhibits a\ndecreasing trend. Figure 2i illustrates the potential difference\nbetween the foci of the two lobe cells, which is believed to be\nrelated to the lobe reconnection rate at the high-latitude mag-\nnetopause when the IMF is northward. It should be noted that\nthis potential difference is of the opposite sense to the total\ntranspolar voltage. The lobe potential difference was varying\nbetween \u201311 and \u201323 keV, with some transient enhancements\nwith periods between 4 and 16 min. This suggests that the\ndayside high-latitude lobe reconnection during IMF Bz posi-\ntive is a transient phenomenon, just like dayside low-latitude\nreconnection. The magnitude of the lobe potential difference\nalso had a decreasing trend.\nInspection of the flow maps, such as those presented in\nFig. 3, shows that, in addition to the temporally varying lobe\ncell activity, there were also strong flow bursts occurring in\nthe post-noon sector, mainly in the antisunward direction.\nFigure 2j shows the peak antisunward flow speed measured\nin this post-noon sector, occurring in each 2-min Map Po-\ntential plot. In order to provide a representative value, we\nhave averaged the vector velocities in bins of four \u201cpixels\u201d\nof the Map Potential algorithm, corresponding to 2\u25e6 of lati-\ntude and typically \u223c7\u25e6 of longitude. Figure 2j demonstrates\nthe bursty nature of the flow with 6\u201324 min periods evident.\nThe averaged value of the peak flow speed over the interval,\n625 m s\u22121, is indicated by the horizontal dotted line, empha-\nsizing the peaks in the flow. The onsets of these peaks are\nmarked by the vertical dashed lines. Comparison with the\ndata in Fig. 2i shows that most of the onsets of flow bursts\ncorresponded to the onsets of the lobe potential enhance-\nments, although not all lobe potential enhancements had flow\nbursts associated with them. In Fig. 2k, the latitude of the\nantisunward flow burst peak velocity is presented, which il-\nlustrates that the position of the flow burst had a poleward\nmoving trend and there is some evidence for a poleward jump\nshortly after each flow burst event.\n3.3 Radar parameter plots\nTo examine the dayside convection flows in detail, Fig. 4\npresents the line-of-sight velocity and spectral width of the\nbeams highlighted in Fig. 1, in magnetic coordinates. The\nscales of the parameters are illustrated with the colour bars\nto the right of the related panels. It should be noted that,\nin these plots, only ionospheric backscatter is plotted, and\nthe positive (negative) velocities correspond to plasma drift\ntoward (away from) the radar. The vertical dashed lines il-\nlustrate the onsets of the flow bursts identified in Fig. 2.\nFigure 4a and d give the magnetic latitude-time-parameter\nplots for Beam 9 of CUTLASS-Finland radar Channel B with\na 7 s resolution. A small region of backscatter appeared for\na very short period around 12:30 UT between magnetic lat-\nitudes 76\u201378\u25e6, which is related to the positive By dominant\nIMF. Stronger and more extensive backscatter appeared af-\nter 12:50 UT at higher latitudes of 78\u201382\u25e6, which occurred\nabout 10 min after IMFBz turned strongly northward. Subse-\nquently, the antisunward flow bursts in the post-noon region\npropagated poleward, with broad spectral width.\nFigures 4b and e give the magnetic longitude-time-\nparameters plots for beam 5 of the CUTLASS-Iceland\nradar Channel B with 7-s resolution. Similar to Finland\nBeam 9, some weak backscatter appeared in a very short pe-\nriod around 12:30 UT near noon and stronger ionospheric\nbackscatter appeared in the post-noon sector after 12:50 UT,\nwhich are related to the IMFBy dominant and strongly north-\nward IMF, respectively. After 12:50 UT flow burst structures\n(seen clearly as sloping velocity structures in Fig. 4b) prop-\nagating eastwards with a speed of 600 m s\u22121, away from the\nradar, occurred in the antisunward flow and wider spectral\nwidth region. It is interesting that the direction and magni-\ntude of the propagation speed are similar to the flow speed\nitself.\nFigures 4c and f give magnetic latitude-time-parameter\nplots for Beam 6 of the Goose Bay radar which probed the\nmidday region during this interval, with a 2-min resolution.\nFigure 4c shows that a strong antisunward flow appeared for\na short period around 12:30 UT. At 12:48 UT the flow speed\nbecame sunward (towards the radar). The sunward flow per-\nsisted in the field of view for more than 2 h. This switch is re-\nlated to the time-lagged IMF orientation change at 12:40 UT.\nDMSP particle data shows (see section below) that the sun-\nward flow region is the cusp.\n3.4 DMSP flow and particle data\nIn Fig. 5a, the DMSP\/F13 track and the horizontal cross-\ntrack velocity data during 13:40\u201313:55 UT are overlaid on\nthe Northern Hemispheric potential map at 13:46 UT.

Red and blue lines in the bottom of this panel are used\nto highlight the period of antisunward and sunward flows,\nas were identified in Fig. 5a. The characteristic energy and\nenergy flux illustrate that these particles, related to antisun-\nward convection, were mainly from the low-latitude bound-\nary layer (LLBL) (Newell and Meng, 1992), interrupted by\nBPS or accelerated LLBL particles. Although the SSJ4 in-\nstrument on F13 has degraded low energy ion detectors (be-\nlow 1 keV) since 1995, we can still distinguish that there\nwas no dispersed low-energy ion cutoff in the ion energy\nspectrum, which suggests that DMSP was on field lines that\nhad been merged for a very long time or were closed (Chang\net al., 2004). The convection reversals are located within\nthe LLBL. The sunward flow region at higher latitude was\nmainly in a region void of precipitation, interrupted by some\nspiky structures with BPS or mantle features in the elec-\ntron spectrum, although. The spikes in this region were sur-\nrounded by a diffuse background that was vastly weaker than\nthat in the lower-latitude antisunward flow regions, which\nsuggests that the high energy electrons might have been ac-\ncelerated in the magnetosphere, implying that the antisun-\nward flow and the sunward flow regions in the ionosphere\nwere related to the LLBL and polar cap\/mantle, respectively.\nFigure 6a shows the track of the DMSP F14 during its pas-\nsage over the northern polar region from dusk to the pre-noon\nsector during 14:30\u201314:45 UT, overlaid on the potential\nmap and the spectral width data of Iceland West Radar at\n14:40 UT, with the segment of the track in red, highlighting\nAnn.

The flow patterns observed by\nthe two different systems are again similar. The flow direc-\ntion was sunward in the cusp and changed to antisunward\nwhen the satellite had passed through the cusp region into\nthe lower-latitude region. The spectral width is wider in the\ncusp region, and in fact the backscatter power (not shown) is\nalso stronger than other regions.\nThe particle and plasma flow data from DMSP F14 during\n14:41\u201314:44 UT are presented in Fig. 6b. During 14:41:38\u2013\n14:42:11 UT, the same period as the red segment track il-\nlustrated in Fig. 6a, the average energy and energy flux\nfor electrons and ions were approximately (100 eV, 1010\u2013\n1011 eV (cm2 s sr)\u22121) and (1 keV, 1010\u20131011 eV (cm2 s sr)\u22121,\nrespectively, indicating that these particles were from the\ncusp (Newell and Meng, 1992). The ion energy spectrum in\nthe bottom panel of Fig. 6b shows that a low-energy ion cut-\noff and reversed ion dispersion structure also occurred in this\nregion, which suggests that lobe reconnection indeed hap-\npened at the higher latitude cusp (Matsuoka et al., 1996).\nMost interesting is that the ion dispersion structure was a\nsawtooth-like structure (Morley and Lockwood, 2003), con-\nfirming that the lobe reconnection was pulsed, which will be\ndiscussed later. When the DMSP F14 passed the cusp into\nthe lower-latitude region, the low energy cutoff phenomena\nin the ion energy disappeared, and the electron and ion av-\nerage energies increased, which indicate that the satellite en-\ntered the LLBL region (interrupted by mantle precipitation)\nwhere flow direction changed to antisunward.\nIn the equinox season, positive IMF Bx is believed\nto favour lobe reconnection and four-cell convection in\nthe Southern Hemisphere (Lockwood and Moen, 1999).\nHowever, the ionospheric backscatter from southern Super-\nDARN radars was too poor to analyse the global convection\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2227\/2006\/ Ann.

Fortunately, the DMSP satellites measured some\nflow data during two of their southern passages. In order\nto compare the conjugate hemispheric convection, in Fig. 7,\nSouthern Hemisphere DMSP data are overlaid on the North-\nern Hemisphere convection maps at the central times of the\npassages. To eliminate the asymmetry caused by IMF By\nin the two hemispheres, we plot Northern Hemisphere con-\nvection maps and the DMSP Southern Hemisphere track\nin AACGM coordinates (Baker and Wing, 1989), looking\ndown on the geomagnetic north pole and south pole, respec-\ntively, so that the direction of the horizontal coordinates for\nthe DMSP track is opposite to the northern potential map,\nnamely 06:00 MLT is to the right side for the potential map\nwhile for the DMSP track it is to the left. Figure 7a demon-\nstrates that the sunward flow region was mainly in the post-\nnoon (pre-noon) sector of the central part of the northern\n(southern) polar region, which is coincident with the con-\nvection pattern for small negative By around 12:56 UT. Fig-\nure 7b shows the antisunward flow enhancement in the post-\nnoon (pre-noon) sector of the Northern (Southern) Hemi-\nsphere polar region and the sunward flow at the central parts\nof the polar regions when IMF By was negative. Thus a simi-\nlar dayside convection pattern occurred in both hemispheres,\nsuggesting that magnetopause reconnection occurred in both\nlobe boundaries during this period.\n4 Discussion\n4.1 The post-noon flow bursts\nThe peak flow speed in the post-noon sector shows that the\nantisunward flow bursts happened with a period of 6\u201324 min\n(see Fig. 2j). Viscous interaction may always produce some\nantisunward flow in the low-latitude boundary layers, inde-\npendent of any reconnection. However, during the interval\nof interest, neither solar wind plasma density nor solar wind\nspeed has any obvious variation, indicating that such inter-\naction has little contribution to the flow bursts. On the other\nhand, the coincidence of the onsets of the flow bursts and\nthe enhancements on the lobe cell potential difference sug-\ngests that they are closely related (see Fig. 2). There are\ntwo alternative interpretations for this relationship: in the\nfirst the transient lobe reconnection caused lobe potential en-\nhancements and the flow bursts; while in the second the low-\nlatitude reconnection in the post-noon sector caused the anti-\nsunward flow bursts and then influenced the lobe cell poten-\ntial, in turn. Both of the SuperDARN and DMSP observa-\ntions support the former assumption.\nIn the flow burst region, the spectral width was broad (see\nFig. 4), which has been used as the criterion of open field re-\ngion in the IMF southward situations. In this case, however,\nwhen IMF Bz was strongly northward, the electron energies\nand energy flux observed by the DMSP in this region sug-\ngest that these particles were from the low-latitude boundary\nlayer (LLBL) (Newell and Meng, 1992). There was no low-\nenergy ion cutoff in the ion energy spectrum, which suggests\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 2227\u20132242, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2227\/2006\/\nH.

The Iceland East radar, whose beam was\ndirected antisunward during the highlighted interval, ob-\nserved flow burst structures, seen clearly in Fig. 4b, which\npropagated with a similar speed to the flow speed around\n600 m s\u22121 in the antisunward direction. These structures\nwere located in the post-noon sector, between the high-\nlatitude anti-clockwise lobe cell and the low-latitude anti-\nclockwise Dungey cell in the large scale flow pattern. This\nsuggests that the flow bursts and related precipitation were\ncaused by reconnection occurring elsewhere; otherwise, the\ntransient should not propagate in the plasma flow velocity but\nin a phase velocity in the ionosphere. Provan et al. (1998) ob-\nserved that the velocity of the transients at the reconnection\nregion was much higher than that of the ionospheric flow.\nThe latitude of the peak flow at the post-noon sector ex-\nhibits abrupt poleward jumps just after the flow burst onsets\n(see Fig. 2k), which might imply that the polar cap contracted\nwhen the flow bursts occurred, even though DMSP data show\nthat these structures were on the equatorward edge of the\nopen\/closed field boundary. If low-latitude reconnection hap-\npens, it would have opened the closed field lines and then\nenlarged the polar cap, resulting in equatorward rather than\npoleward jumps. Polar cap contraction, not only at the night-\nside boundary (Lester et al., 1990) but also at the dayside\nboundary (Moen et al., 2004), may effectively be controlled\nby tail reconnection (Cowley and Lockwood, 1992); how-\never, no evidence of coincident tail reconnection is observed\nin the nightside magnetometer data, and the agreement of the\nantisunward flow bursts and the lobe potential variation im-\nplies that the poleward jumps in the flow burst structure were\nnot caused by tail reconnection but by lobe reconnection oc-\ncurring in both hemispheres.\nAlthough DMSP F13 observed antisunward flow enhance-\nments both in the post-noon and pre-noon sectors (see Fig. 5),\nthe map potential analysis demonstrates that most of the day-\nside flow bursts occurred in the postnoon sector, which was\nassociated with prolonged small negative IMF By . Lobe\nreconnection excites sunward flows in the cusp region and\nthen as a result of magnetic tension, the reconnected field\nlines slide around either the dawn or the dusk flank, before\nbeing returned to the tail lobe by the magnetosheath flow.\nThe prolonged negative IMF By , although its magnitude was\nvery small, led to more field lines moving towards the dusk\nflank, and therefore the flow bursts periodically occurred in\nthe post-noon sector instead of the pre-noon sector.\n4.2 Transient characteristics of the lobe reconnection\nDuring 13:00\u201315:00 UT on 2 March 2002, both northern Su-\nperDARN radars and DMSP satellites observed a four-cell\nconvection pattern and sunward flow in the central part of\nthe polar region, which illustrates that the lobe reconnection\nindeed happened in Northern Hemisphere, the reversed cusp\nion dispersion signature observed by DMSP F14 confirms it\nfurther. These observations also give us some evidence to\nbelieve that the lobe reconnection is transient.\nAssuming that the middle point (Pm) of the straight line\nbetween the foci of the two lobe cells is located within the\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2227\/2006\/ Ann.

During 13:00\u201315:00 UT Pm\nvaried between 79.3\u201383.5\u25e6 AACGM Latitude, and 10.7\u2013\n13.0 MLT. Its average location was at 80.2\u25e6 AACGM Lati-\ntude, 12.0 MLT. These ionospheric locations may be mapped\nto the outer magnetosphere with the T96 model (Tsyganenko\n1997), in which the solar wind plasma density, velocity, IMF\nBy , Bz and Dst are taken at 10 cm\u22123, 390 km s\u22121, \u20132 nT,\n10 nT and \u201312 nT, respectively. The limiting and average lo-\ncations of Pm are mapped in Fig. 8, which shows the model\nfield lines in the GSE XY and XZ planes, along with the es-\ntimated T96 magnetopause. This mapping suggests that the\nlocation of the reconnection occurred on lobe field lines dur-\ning this period, and that the reconnection line was extended\nor variable in the GSE Y direction, although clearly the ac-\ncuracy of the field line model may be limited.\nAs a first order estimate, the potential difference between\nthe foci of the lobe cells, whose direction is opposite to that\nof the total potential difference in the whole polar region,\nrepresents the lobe reconnection rate. During the interval of\ninterest, the lobe cell potential was variable (see Fig. 2i), with\na period of 4\u201316 min, which suggests that the lobe reconnec-\ntion is also transient with the same period. The time scale is\nsimilar to the observation made by Chisham et al. (2004).\nThe polar cap potential is decreasing during the interval\nof interest. Lockwood et al. (1999) noted that much of the\nvoltage associated with antisunward flow during northward\nIMF is due to field line closure in the tail and is not caused\nby either a viscous-like interaction or field line opening at\nthe dayside magnetopause. There were no substorm signa-\ntures observed during periods of prolonged northward IMF.\nWygant et al. (1983) showed that the range of residual trans-\npolar voltages during northward IMF dropped progressively\nwith time since the northward turning of the IMF. This indi-\ncates that such voltage is associated with open flux produced\nby the prior period(s) of southward IMF.\nIn addition to the periodic flow bursts discussed above, the\nDMSP particle data also demonstrate that the related lobe re-\nconnection was transient. During subsolar reconnection un-\nder southward IMF (Bz<0), \u201cstepped\u201d and \u201csawtooth\u201d signa-\ntures have been shown to be caused by pulsed reconnection\n(Morley and Lockwood, 2003). During lobe reconnection\nunder northward IMF (Bz> 0), the sunward convection will\nresult in a reversed cusp ion dispersion (Woch and Lundin,\n1992). As the ion precipitation evolves with elapsed time\nsince reconnection, the particle dispersion process is just like\nsubsolar reconnection, in which newly-reconnected lines al-\nlow particles from the magnetosheath to precipitate through\nthe magnetospheric cusp into the ionosphere. The velocity\ndispersion as the particles travel along field-lines from the\npoint of particle injection means that the more energetic par-\nticles of any species will reach the ionosphere before the less\nenergetic particles. The low-energy ion cutoff is directly re-\nlated to the time elapsed since reconnection. Since the con-\nvection direction is opposite to the southward IMF Bz, the\nion dispersion will be reversed. The discontinuity of ion dis-\npersion observed here (see Fig. 6) confirms that the lobe re-\nconnection was transient.\nAlthough the flow speed observed by the Goose Bay radar\nat the sunward flow region was not particularly variable (see\nFig. 4e), the reconnection is not necessarily steady. When\nlobe reconnection occurs, the sunward flow is driven by the\nmagnetic tension which is in the opposite direction of the\nsheath flow, so that the sunward flow speed and its change are\ndepressed. On the other hand, after the newly-reconnected\nfield lines become overdraped to the dusk or dawn side, the\nmagnetic tension and the sheath flow speed are in the same\ndirection, so that the variation in the antisunward flow are\namplified. Due to the small negative By , most of reconnected\nfield lines were overdraped with the post-noon sector, caus-\ning flow bursts in this region.\n4.3 The IMF effect on lobe reconnection\nUsually the time lag is very important in any analysis of the\nIMF effect on solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere cou-\npling. The time lag may vary and is different for recon-\nnection at different locations, especially for low-latitude and\nhigh-latitude reconnection; therefore, it is very difficult to\nobtain an exact IMF time lag. In this study, we use the con-\nstant IMF time lag of 67 min calculated with the algorithm of\nKhan and Cowley (1999) designed for subsolar reconnection,\nalthough the high-latitude ionospheric convection switching\nfrom antisunward to sunward, as observed by the Goose Bay\nradar, demonstrates that this time lag is underestimated for\nhigh-latitude reconnection. However, since prolonged, sta-\nble IMF conditions prevail over the interval under study, the\nuncertainties in the lag has no significant influence on our\nresults.\nDuring the interval of interest, the IMF conditions were\nquite stable with strongly positive Bz, positive Bx , small and\nnegative By . Moore et al. (2002) calculated the shape of the\nX-line for the full range of clock angles using a generic T89\ninternal magnetic field model. They found an X line shape\nthat is very similar to that inferred by Sandholt et al. (2003),\nfor dominant IMF By , but also found that subsolar recon-\nnection will weaken and disappear for nearly northward Bz\n(small clock angles). As the clock angle increases from near\nzero, the X line traverses the subsolar region, producing some\nweak antisunward flow, but mainly azimuthal flows corre-\nsponding to overdraping effects, as we note here.\nAt equinox there is no dipole-tilt. Since Bx was positive\nand By negative, the phase plane containing IMF first hit the\nmagnetopause poleward and duskward of southern cusp, and\nsuch conditions have been believed to favour southern lobe\nreconnection (Lockwood and Moen, 1999). The DMSP flow\ndata during southern polar region passages illustrate that lobe\nreconnection and a four-cell convection pattern occurred in\nthe both Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Unfortunately,\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 2227\u20132242, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2227\/2006\/\nH. Hu et al.: Dayside flow bursts and high-latitude reconnection 2239\ntoo little ionospheric backscatter was observed by the south-\nern SuperDARN radars to study the convection pattern in the\nSouthern Hemisphere. In contrast, excellent coverage of the\nionospheric scatter observed by northern SuperDARN radars\nshowed that the four-cell convection pattern in the North-\nern Hemisphere lasted for at least 1.5 h. The sunward iono-\nspheric flow preferentially occurred at prenoon.\nAn interpretation of the proposed magnetopause reconnec-\ntion geometry is illustrated in Fig. 9. Figure 9a is a view\nof the magnetosphere from the dusk flank, in which points\nX1 and X2 are reconnection locations, the dotted line is the\nopen\/closed field boundary. Figure 9b is a view of the mag-\nnetopause from the Sun. When Bx is positive and the el-\nevation angle is about 20\u25e6, strongly positive Bz and small\nIMF By cause the reconnection to first occur in the south-\nern dusk-side lobe in Fig. 9a, the newly-reconnected field\nis draped sunward and westward by magnetic tension, and\nthen the draped interplanetary magnetic field lines from the\nSouthern Hemisphere reconnect with the northern lobe field\nlines on the dawn side, resulting in a sunward and eastward\nflow in northern high-latitude region. In other words, the\nlobe reconnection might first occur in the open field region\nin the Southern Hemisphere and then on the open\/closed field\nline boundary in the Northern Hemisphere, resulting in four-\ncell convections in both hemispheres and the closure of open\nmagnetic flux.\nDuring the interval, the locations of the flow bursts had a\npoleward moving trend, which indicates that the polar cap\ntended to contract. At the onset of the flow bursts, the peak\nlocation of the bursts also had poleward jumps, which sug-\ngests that the polar cap contraction might partly be caused by\nthe re-closing of open field lines by lobe reconnection occur-\nring in both hemispheres.\n5 Summary\nIn this paper we present SuperDARN and DMSP satellite ob-\nservations when the IMF was strongly northward. Although\nthe IMF Bx was positive during most of the interval of in-\nterest, which is believed to favour Southern Hemisphere lobe\nreconnection at equinox, a four-cell convection pattern oc-\ncurred in the Northern Hemisphere and lasted for at least\n1.5 h, with periodic flow bursts in the post-noon antisun-\nward convection region associated with LLBL precipitation\non closed field lines. The flow burst structures propagated at\na similar speed to the plasma convection, and the location of\nthe flow bursts had poleward jumps at the onset times, which\nsuggests that the flow bursts are not caused by low-latitude\nreconnection. The flow burst onsets were rather related to the\nonsets of the lobe potential enhancements, which implies that\nthe transient lobe reconnection results in the periodic flow\nbursts.

During most of the interval, IMF\nBx is positive, which favours southern lobe reconnection, so\nthat the lobe reconnection might occur in the Southern Hemi-\nsphere first, with field lines subsequently overdraped and re-\nclosed by the northern lobe reconnection. Poleward jumps of\nthe position of the flow bursts imply that the flux re-closure\ncaused by the lobe reconnection has some contribution to the\npolar cap contraction.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2227\/2006\/ Ann.
