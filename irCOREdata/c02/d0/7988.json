HUNTLEY, DPHIL(OXON), MRCS, P.G. BUSH, PHD, J.M. MCBIRNIE, FRCS, \nA.H. SIMPSON, DM(OXON), FRCS, AND A.C. HALL, PHD\nInvestigation performed at University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland\nBackground: Autologous osteochondral transfer is an option for the treatment of articular defects. However, there are\nconcerns about graft integration and the nature of the tissue forming the cartilage-cartilage bridge. Chondrocyte viability\nat graft and recipient edges is thought to be an important determinant of the quality of repair. The purpose of the present\nstudy was to evaluate early cell viability at the edges of osteochondral grafts from ex vivo human femoral condyles.\nMethods: Fresh human tissue was obtained from eleven knees at the time of total knee arthroplasty for the treatment\nof osteoarthritis. Osteochondral cylinders were harvested with use of a 4.5-mm-diameter mosaicplasty osteotome from\nregions of the anterolateral aspect of the femoral condyle that were macroscopically nondegenerate and histologically\nnonfibrillated. Plugs were assessed for marginal cell viability by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy.\nResults: The diameter of the cartilaginous portion of the osteochondral plugs was a mean (and standard error of the\nmean) of 4.84 \u00b1 0.12 mm (as determined on the basis of three plugs). This value was approximately 300 \u00b5m greater\nthan the measured internal diameter of the osteotome. There was a substantial margin of superficial zone cell death\n(mean thickness, 382 \u00b1 68.2 \u00b5m), with >99% cell viability seen more centrally (as determined on the basis of five\nplugs). Demiplugs were created by splitting the mosaicplasty explants with a fresh number-11 scalpel blade. The mar-\ngin of superficial zone cell death at the curved edge was significantly greater than that at the site of the scalpel cut\n(390.3 \u00b1 18.8 \u00b5m compared with 34.8 \u00b1 3.2 \u00b5m; p = 0.0286). Similar findings were observed when the cartilage\nalone was breached and the bone was left intact, with the margin of superficial zone cell death being significantly\ngreater than that obtained in association with the straight scalpel incision (268 \u00b1 38.9 \u00b5m compared with 41.3 \u00b1\n13.4 \u00b5m; p = 0.0286). The margin of superficial zone cell death showed no increase during the time-period between\nfifteen minutes and two hours after plug harvest. A mathematical approximation of the mosaicplasty region sug-\ngested that early cell death of this magnitude affects about one third of the superficial graft area.\nConclusions: The results of the present study suggest that mosaicplasty, while capable of transposing viable hyaline\ncartilage, is associated with an extensive margin of cell death that is likely to compromise lateral integration and ar-\nticular reconstruction.\nClinical Relevance: The data suggest that there is a need to improve the plug-harvest technique, which may improve\ngraft-recipient healing and clinical outcomes.\nsteochondral grafting is an attractive concept because\nthe bone can heal by creeping substitution and the\narticular cartilage can survive because of adequate\ndiffusional nutrition. Furthermore, cartilage is a privileged\nimmunological site for allografts because it is avascular and\nchondrocytes are shielded by extracellular matrix. Unfortu-\nnately, articular cartilage has minimal reparative capacity1.\nOver the past two decades, there have been encouraging\nclinical reports concerning osteochondral allografts2, lateral\npatellar autologous grafting for the treatment of large defects\nat the knee3, autologous chondrocyte implantation4,5, and\nautologous osteochondral transfer (mosaicplasty)6-8. Mosaic-\nplasty is an option for the treatment of smaller articular defects,\nespecially those due to trauma or osteochondritis dissecans6-8.\nThe early results of one randomized, controlled trial favored\nautologous chondrocyte implantation over autologous trans-\nO\n\uf733\uf735\uf732\n TH E JO U R NA L OF BONE & JOINT SURGER Y \u00b7  JBJS .ORG\nVOLUME 87-A \u00b7  NU M B E R 2 \u00b7  FE BR U A R Y 2005\nCH ON D RO C Y TE DE A T H AS S O C I A TE D W ITH HU M A N FEM OR AL \nOS TE O CHO N D R A L HA R VE S T A S PER FOR M E D FOR MO S A I C P L A S T Y\nfer5. However, the results of another trial (involving second-\nlook biopsies) were more equivocal, suggesting that fibrocar-\ntilage is the predominant repair tissue following autologous\nchondrocyte implantation8.\nHyaline cartilage has a complex avascular heterogeneous\nstructure9-11 in which chondrocytes constitute only 5% of the\nvolume yet are solely responsible for matrix maintenance.\nThere are many data concerning cartilaginous wounding and\nthe healing response9,11. Partial-thickness defects do not heal, and\nfull-thickness defects repair with mechanically inferior fibro-\ncartilage1. Chondrocyte viability is important in order for extra-\ncellular matrix to remain healthy because, as noted by Gilmore\nand Palfrey12, each chondrocyte has the potential to maintain a\ndiscrete maximum volume of matrix (a domain) surrounding it.\nIt has been well established that surgical maneuvers in-\nvolve cell death at the wound edge13,14, and chondrocyte death\nis ultimately associated with degeneration of the surrounding\nmatrix. Recent whole-animal experiments demonstrated a\nloss of chondrocytes from the cartilage bordering the wound\nedge of partial-thickness defects that had been generated with\na custom-built planing instrument15. Trephine wounding of\nbovine articular cartilage explants induced cell death over\nseveral days16. On the basis of ultrastructural and TUNEL\n(Tdt-mediated biotin-dUDP nick-end labeling) analyses, it\nwas suggested that cell death was at least partially attributable\nto apoptosis16. Trephine wounding of immature bovine carti-\nlage explants that had been harvested off the bone was associ-\nated with a band of cell death. Microautoradiography showed\nlittle isotope incorporation14 in this zone of death, suggesting\nthat there was no new matrix synthesis or proliferation in this\nzone. In addition, the mechanical impact associated with os-\nteochondral tamping into predrilled osseous holes causes su-\nperficial zone cell death17. Studies on the pathological effects\nof impact have shown cell death colocalizing with articular\nsurface cracks18, mixed necrotic and apoptotic features19,\nchondrocyte apoptosis20, and glycosaminoglycan release20.\nHyaline cartilage is capable of surviving transfer. How-\never, after grafting, an absence of matrix-producing cells in\nthe region of the cartilage-cartilage interface makes integrative\ncartilage repair unlikely13,14. Seams of mechanically inferior tis-\nsue or gaps between grafts may affect joint congruency and are\nlikely to be a starting point for further degeneration8. Chon-\ndrocyte viability at the edge is likely to be a determinant of\nlong-term success. However, examination of the effect of os-\nteochondral surgical procedures on graft-edge viability, espe-\ncially in human tissue, has been very limited1,14.\nThe choice of method for the study of cell viability is\ncrucial. In contrast with conventional fixation, sectioning, and\nhistological analysis, confocal laser scanning microscopy al-\nlows three-dimensional visualization of living cells in their na-\ntive extracellular matrix and quantification of living and dead\ncells. It also permits serial optical imaging and three-dimen-\nsional reconstruction. The same volume of tissue can be im-\naged over time and from more than one perspective. For\nexample, cartilage blocks examined from a superficial per-\nspective subsequently can be examined transversely for fibril-\nlation. Confocal laser scanning microscopy therefore confers\nconsiderable advantages over traditional microscopy.\nThe purpose of the present study was to use confocal\nlaser scanning microscopy in association with fluorescent in-\ndicators to determine early cell viability at the human osteo-\nchondral graft edge.\nMaterials and Methods\nBiochemicals\niochemicals were obtained from Sigma (Poole, Dorset,\nUnited Kingdom), unless otherwise stated.

The lateral\ncondylar area from the anterior cut for total knee arthroplasty\n(Fig. 1, A), analogous to the region used during mosaic-\nplasty21,22, was used as a source for osteochondral plugs. A\nspecimen was used only if there was no macroscopic evidence\nof fibrillation, wear lines, or degeneration in the relevant re-\ngion. The rationale behind the use of this tissue is based partly\non evidence documenting the similarity between pristine hu-\nman cartilage and macroscopically nondegenerated cartilage\nspecimens resected from osteoarthritic knees22. Of the twenty-\nfive knees examined, only eleven (from patients ranging from\nfifty-three to seventy-nine years of age) had a lateral condyle\nthat was suitable for this study. Plugs were harvested with use\nof a sterile technique, as utilized for tissue culture. A circular\nmosaicplasty osteotome with a 4.5-mm internal diameter (Fig.\n1, B) was used, according to the mosaicplasty harvest tech-\nnique, within twenty-four hours after the original operation.\nThe osteotome was applied perpendicular to the articular sur-\nface, and the cut was deepened with use of a light (230-g) toffee\nhammer to harvest a bone-cartilage composite plug measur-\ning 7 to 9 mm in length. As during surgery, slight toggling of\nthe osteotome was used to allow dislodging. For experiments\nin which tissue had to be preloaded with dye (see section enti-\ntled Dynamics of Cell Death) or in which only the cartilage\nwas breached (see section entitled Margin of Cell Death When\nBone Not Breached), an osteochondral cuboid (Fig. 1, C) was\ntrimmed with use of a Stanley knife and then was subjected to\nthe plug-harvesting technique in a similar way. No rotational\nmovement was made during the harvesting procedure; all cuts\n(including those performed with a number-11 scalpel blade\nwith its straight blade configuration) were made in push-\nthrough mode, with the direction of the cutting force applied\nsolely perpendicular to the blade edge (analogous to the mode\nof cutting during mosaicplasty). The plug (Fig. 1, D) was re-\nmoved from the inside of the circular chisel with use of an in-\nsert set against the osseous surface. The articular surface was\nkept wet with DMEM throughout the procedure as articular\nchondrocytes are known to be vulnerable to the effects of\ndrying23. Care was taken not to subject the hyaline surface to\nany abrasive or additional force other than those associated\nwith the harvesting procedure. Because of concerns about\nblade sharpness, virgin tools were used when possible and no\nmosaicplasty instrument was used to harvest more than six\nplugs (Fig. 1, D). This number is well within the operating\nlimit of instrument use. The cartilaginous portion of three\nFig. 2\nProjectional image of a human osteochondral \nplug surface, fixed two hours after harvest, \nshowing a zone of circumferential cell death. \nThe plug had been exposed to fluorescent \ndyes for thirty minutes before fixation.

CMFDA is a membrane-permeant dye that is\ncleaved by intracellular esterases to produce a fluorescent and\nmembrane-impermeant product. The cytoplasm of viable\ncells is marked as green25. Conversely, propidium iodide is a\ncharged molecule that is capable of crossing cell membranes\nonly if they are damaged. Propidium iodide stains the nuclei\nof dead cells red. Tissue was incubated with contrast medium\nconcentrations that were chosen to optimize imaging param-\neters (10.75 to 21.5 \u00b5M for CMFDA and 5 \u00b5M for propidium\niodide).\nIncubation and Fixation\nFor most experiments, plugs were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 120\nminutes, with exposure to propidium iodide (5 \u00b5M) and CM-\nFDA (10.75 \u00b5M) for the final thirty minutes. At the end of the\nincubation period, plugs were washed in DMEM and were\ntransferred to 10% formalin (volume per volume) in saline\nsolution. They were stored at 4\u00b0C and, after passage to 70%\nethanol (volume per volume), they were analyzed in water (at\n21\u00b0C) on the subsequent day. However, for the time-course\nexperiments, explants were exposed to propidium iodide (5\n\u00b5M) and CMFDA (21.5 \u00b5M) in DMEM at 37\u00b0C for fifteen\nminutes before incisions were made with the mosaicplasty os-\nteotome and scalpel. They were then transferred for confocal\nlaser scanning microscopy and were maintained in DMEM,\nwith contrast media at the same concentration, at 21\u00b0C over\nthe time-course indicated.\nMicroscopy\nAn upright Zeiss Axioskop LSM 510 confocal laser scanning\nmicroscope was fitted with an objective (\u00d710 dry) to acquire\nimages of in situ articular chondrocytes labeled with fluores-\ncent dyes. A multitrack protocol involving argon and HeNe\n(helium-neon) excitation allowed separation of the fluores-\ncence emitted from CMFDA (which stained the cytoplasm of\nlive cells green) and propidium iodide (which stained the nu-\nclei of dead cells red). CMFDA and propidium iodide were\nsubjected to excitation wavelengths (EX\u03bb) of 488 and 543 nm,\nrespectively, with use of bandpass and long pass filters to mea-\nsure emission (500 to 550 nm and >560 nm, respectively).\nCartilage was viewed from both surface and transverse per-\nspectives, thereby allowing for the imaging of all zones in de-\ntail throughout the full cartilage depth. Laser power, detector\ngain, and sensitivity were adjusted to obtain optimal images\nwithout excessive bleaching or saturation. Optical sections\nwere obtained at approximately 10-\u00b5m intervals over a depth\nof 170 \u00b5m.\nImage Analysis\nImages were overlaid and projected over appropriate depths\nwith use of the Zeiss Image Browser (Hertfordshire, United\nKingdom). Mean margins of cell death were calculated with\nuse of measurements of the plug perimeter and the associated\nsector area of cell death, according to the equation: \nd = 1000 \u00d7 r \u2212 [r2 \u2212 (2.r.A\/p)]1\/2\nwhere d is the margin of cell death (in \u00b5m), A is the measured\narea (in mm2), r is the radius of the plug (in mm), and p is the\nmeasured perimeter (in mm). For the 4.5-mm harvester, the\nactual plug diameter was 4.84 mm (and the radius was 2.42\nmm) (see Results section). Values were recorded from multi-\nple images for all tissues to ensure imaging of the plug circum-\nference in its entirety.\nTissue Grading\nAnterolateral femoral condylar tissue was used only if there\nwas no macroscopic evidence of degeneration, fibrillation, or\nwear lines24. The samples were confirmed as being focally non-\ndegenerate (grade 0 according to the system described by Bush\nand Hall24) by means of microscopic transverse sectional im-\naging (confocal laser scanning microscopy; \u00d710 objective) to\nensure that all zones were without fibrillation or splitting on\nthe basis of extracellular matrix autofluorescence and tissue-\nstaining.\nStatistical Analysis\nGenerally, data are given as the mean and the standard error of\nthe mean. For measurements pertaining to the marginal zone\nof death, normality could not be assumed on the basis of the\nsmall number of observations. Therefore, where appropriate,\nnonparametric significance tests were used (GraphPad Prism;\nGraphPad Software, San Diego, California).\nFig. 3\nThree representative projectional views (depth, \n170 \u00b5m) of a plug surface, showing the hetero-\ngeneity of the marginal zone of cell death (red \nstain).

Untraumatized areas at the center of the plugs demon-\nstrated >99% viability (Fig. 2). There was considerable intra-\nplug heterogeneity with regard to the width of the marginal\nzone of cell death, as shown in a range of three-dimensional\nsummation views over the most superficial 170 \u00b5m, the ap-\nproximate penetrative limit of this technique (Fig. 3). When\nviewed from the side (again to a depth of approximately 170\n\u00b5m), the curved edge of four of the five plugs showed >99%\ncell death throughout the full depth of cartilage, similar to the\nfindings noted along the curved edge of the demiplugs in later\nexperiments.\nFour plugs, each of which had been cut from a different\njoint, were used for the demiplug experiments. In these ex-\nperiments, the thickness of the zone of cell death along the\ncircular cut (the cut that had been made with use of the mosa-\nicplasty osteotome) was compared with that along a straight\ncut down the center of the plug (the cut that had been made\nwith use of a fresh number-11 scalpel blade). From the superfi-\ncial perspective, the thickness of the zone of cell death along\nthe curved cut (mosaicplasty osteotome) was significantly\ngreater than that along the straight cut (scalpel blade) (390 \u00b1\n18.8 \u00b5m compared with 34.8 \u00b1 3.2 \u00b5m; p = 0.0286, Mann-\nWhitney test). A representative view that includes the junction\nof the curved and straight edges is shown in Figure 4, A. Repre-\nsentative side views of the straight (scalpel blade) and curved\n(osteotome) cuts are shown in Figure 4, B and C, respectively.\nThe osteotome cut produced >99% cell death to the limits of\nlaser penetration (approximately 170 \u00b5m) throughout the full\ndepth of the cartilage.\nMargin of Cell Death When \nBone Not Breached\nIt was important to address the potential problem posed by the\nforce required to breach the subchondral bone in these samples\nas this force might be greater than that required in younger\njoints without degenerative disease. The mosaicplasty os-\nteotome and number-11 scalpel blade incisions were made in\nfour osteochondral explants, each from a different joint, with\ncare being taken to penetrate the cartilage only (that is, not to\ntransgress the subchondral bone) before blade removal. These\nexplants subsequently were subjected to the same protocol as\ndescribed in the Materials and Methods section (incubation at\n37\u00b0C for two hours, with exposure to contrast medium for the\nlast thirty minutes only) before fixation. The zone of cell death\nat the curved edge was significantly greater than that at the\nstraight edge (268 \u00b1 38.9 \u00b5m compared with 41.3 \u00b1 13.4 \u00b5m;\np = 0.0286, Mann-Whitney test).

The graft edge zone of\ncell death showed no increase during the time-period be-\ntween fifteen minutes and two hours after the incision. The\nresults of three separate experiments are shown in Figure 6,\nA, with representative views from one experiment shown in\nFigure 6, B (depicting the zone along a curved cut made with\nuse of a mosaicplasty osteotome) and Figure 6, C (depicting\nthe zone along a straight cut made with use of a fresh scalpel\nblade). These data indicate that from the earliest available\ntime-point (fifteen minutes) to two hours after harvest with\nthe mosaicplasty osteotome, there was no progression in the\nmargin of cell death.\nDiscussion\nristine human tissues for experimentation are in short sup-\nply. The bulk of the experimental work concerning cartilage\nwounding, integrative cartilage repair, and osteochondral graft-\ning has involved animal models, and the results of such studies\ncan only be extrapolated to the human situation with caution.\nWe have chosen an alternative approach involving the use of\nmacroscopically nondegenerate cartilage explants from joint\nsurfaces harvested from patients undergoing total knee replace-\nment for the treatment of osteoarthritis. The anterolateral as-\npect of the femoral condyle is often spared macroscopically\nfrom the arthritic process and correlates with the osteochondral\nharvest site for autografting (mosaicplasty). Macroscopically\nnondegenerate cartilage from patients undergoing knee arthro-\nplasty for osteoarthritis previously has been found to be indis-\ntinguishable from normal human cartilage in terms of basic\nbiochemical, metabolic, and histological parameters22.\nCell viability of this surface can be maintained at close\nto 100% if it is passed rapidly to DMEM, maintained at 4\u00b0C,\nand used within twenty-four hours. Nevertheless, there are\nreservations about using tissue (1) from joints with estab-\nlished osteoarthritis, (2) from patients in this age-group, and\n(3) after refrigeration overnight (even if use occurs within\ntwenty-four hours). Aging is known to affect cartilage and\nchondrocytes9,26. Hangody and Fules6 found that the results\nof mosaicplasty were better in younger as compared with\nolder patients and therefore proposed an upper age-limit of\nfifty years for this procedure. In the present study, although\nthere was occasional chondrocyte clustering in some sec-\ntions, the cartilage surface appeared normal macroscopically\nand transverse views of the articular surface did not demon-\nstrate fibrillation or fissuring in the superficial zone (col-\nlagen autofluorescence) when observed with confocal laser\nscanning microscopy (Fig. 3, B and C). It is not inconceiv-\nable that passage to DMEM and storage at 4\u00b0C overnight\nmight have altered the mechanical sensitivity of chondro-\ncytes. Nonetheless, there was a significant difference in the\nmargin of cell death associated with mosaicplasty and scalpel\ncuts to the same depth. Furthermore, for fresh allograft pro-\ncedures, storage at 4\u00b0C in Ringer\u2019s lactate for up to forty-\neight hours is accepted practice21.\nA further reservation is that excessive force might be re-\nquired to harvest plugs from this tissue. Subchondral sclerosis\nis a pathological feature of osteoarthritis, and therefore the\nforce required to harvest osteochondral plugs from the joint\nresection specimens might be greater than that required at the\ntime of mosaicplasty in younger knees. Although osteochon-\ndral harvesting was performed only on tissue that was grossly\nand histologically nondegenerate, it was nevertheless impor-\ntant to perform experiments in which only the cartilaginous\ntissue was breached and the plug was left in situ (Fig. 5). The\nmargin of cell death was again significantly greater than that\nobserved in association with a single scalpel cut to the same\nlevel, supporting the contention that it is trauma to the carti-\nlage alone that is predominantly responsible for the observed\nmarginal zone of cell death. It is emphasized that number-11\nscalpel blade cuts constitute an internal negative control and\nthat there is minimal marginal cell death in relation to such\nincisions. With respect to the thickness of the zone of mar-\nginal death, our findings contrast with those of Williams et\nal.27, who used a coring drill and found no evidence of \u201cther-\nmal damage\u201d at the periphery of 15-mm-diameter plugs\nwhen the periphery was compared with the central portion of\nthe graft.\nConversely, damage to the superficial zone of the graft\nmay exceed that indicated by early cell death in our model be-\ncause further processes leading to cell death may only become\nmanifest after the end of our time-course (that is, more than\ntwo hours after harvest). Also, during mosaicplasty, the graft\nsurface is subjected to direct trauma when it is impacted into a\npredrilled hole. This tamping procedure is known to compro-\nmise chondrocyte viability17. Furthermore, the plugs used for\nour experiments were shorter (length, 7 to 9 mm) than those\nobtained during mosaicplasty (length, 15 to 25 mm)6-8, which\nminimized the trauma due to frictional contact on the inner\naspect of the circular osteotome. The circumferential death in-\ndicates that the mosaicplasty construct lacks superficial zone\nhyaline cartilage-cartilage contact, suggesting a mechanically\ninferior construct in terms of spreading contact stresses.\nThere are a variety of modes through which surgical\nprocedures can damage an articular surface. Cells near the cut\nsurface may be exposed to a variety of insults, including com-\npression, tension, and shear forces. These forces depend on\nparameters such as (1) the proximity of the blade (that is, the\nproximity of the cell to the cut surface), (2) the type of cutting\nedge, (3) the relation of the cutting edge to its supportive\nabrasive surface (the face of the blade), and (4) the angulation\nof the cutting edge and surface to planes in the extracellular\nmatrix with which chondrocytes are associated. In the present\nstudy, both number-11 scalpel blades and mosaicplasty os-\nteotomes were used solely in a push-through mode (i.e., with\nno sawing or rotatory movements) in order to minimize abra-\nsive and shear forces.\nIn response to trauma, cell death may occur rapidly\n(within minutes) as a result of direct mechanical disruption,\nbut it also may occur over a more prolonged period. It is inter-\nesting that there was no progression in the boundary of mar-\nP\n\uf733\uf735\uf739\n TH E JO U R NA L OF BONE & JOINT SURGER Y \u00b7  JBJS .ORG\nVOLUME 87-A \u00b7  NU M B E R 2 \u00b7  FE BR U A R Y 2005\nCH ON D RO C Y TE DE A T H AS S O C I A TE D W ITH HU M A N FEM OR AL \nOS TE O CHO N D R A L HA R VE S T A S PER FOR M E D FOR MO S A I C P L A S T Y\nginal cell death between fifteen minutes and two hours (Fig.\n6). There was an absence of dye colocalization, suggesting\nleakage of the CMFDA product away from cellular remains\nshowing nuclear-binding of propidium iodide. This finding\nsupports our contention that punctate red-staining is indica-\ntive of cell death rather than sublethal injury. Tew et al.16 docu-\nmented cell death over a longer time-course at a trephined\nwound edge in both mature and immature bovine cartilage\nexplants; their data suggest cell death by a combination of ap-\noptosis and necrosis. Our documentation of early chondro-\ncyte death does not preclude other processes from occurring\nover a longer time-period. Indeed, an understanding of the\nmechanisms underlying early and late cell death may allow the\ndevelopment of cytoprotective strategies for the graft edge.\nNot surprisingly, there was intraplug heterogeneity with\nregard to the width of the marginal zone of cell death (Fig. 3),\nwhich may have been due in part to the anisotropy of hyaline\ncartilage, as has been demonstrated in compression28, indenta-\ntion stiffness29, and split-line studies of the femoral condyle30.\nThe heterogeneity means that to derive an average thickness\nfor the marginal zone of death, it is important to have either a\nrandom sampling procedure or the capability to image the en-\ntire plug or demiplug.\nThe approximate tenfold increase in thickness of the zone\nof cell death when the cartilage was incised with use of the mo-\nsaicplasty osteotome as opposed to the scalpel may have been\nrelated to a variety of features of the surgical implement (or a\ncombination of these features). These features include the facts\nthat (1) the cutting edge of the osteotome is squared-off, (2) the\ntaper to the cutting edge of the osteotome blade is less acute\nthan that of the scalpel blade, (3) the cutting edge of the os-\nteotome is curved, which may have deleterious consequences in\nterms of developing a plane of cleavage through the matrix, and\n(4) the osteotome has an internal bevel to a closed (circular)\nsystem and therefore the tissue at the plug margin is likely to be\ncompressed and subjected to increased abrasion or shear as it is\npassed through the osteotome.\nMeasurements of the diameter of the cartilaginous por-\ntion of three plugs with use of Vernier calipers suggested that\nthere is considerable expansion of the tissue after removal from\nthe osteotome. It is possible that there may be tissue compres-\nsion against the edge of the osteotome due to the combination\nof an internal bevel and a closed (circular) system. After re-\nmoval from the osteotome, the cartilage expands to its former\narea. Trauma to the wound edge may cause subsequent swelling\nin DMEM as a result of osmotic flux into unconstrained gly-\ncosaminoglycans. Furthermore, there may be internal stress re-\nlease following incision, causing tissue expansion.\nRecently, Redman et al.14 used immature bovine carti-\nlage explants that had been cut off the bone as a model carti-\nlage system with which to compare the effects of trauma\ncaused by a blunt instrument (a trephine) and that caused by a\nsharp instrument (a scalpel blade). In response to blunt in-\njury, the authors characterized a band of cell death that ex-\ntended approximately 100 \u00b5m from the wound edge.\nThe present study extends previous findings concerning\nexcessive marginal death at the graft edge because it uses the\ncurrent mosaicplasty technique as a directly relevant surgical\nparadigm. However, on the basis of our results, we cannot yet\ndesignate a particular feature of osteotome design as the cause\nof marginal cell death. Recently, Evans et al.31 compared the ef-\nfects of two harvest procedures (manual punch and power-\nharvesting) on chondrocyte viability and documented more\ndamage in the power-trephine group. We are engaged in addi-\ntional research concerning blade geometry and harvesting in\norder to identify improvements to minimize chondrocyte\ndeath at the graft edge.\nIn conclusion, we observed a marked marginal zone\nof cell death (with a thickness of just under 400 \u00b5m) in os-\nteochondral plugs within two hours after harvest with use\nof the mosaicplasty technique. Using a planar model for\nclose-packed circles (see Appendix), we estimated that ap-\nproximately 24% of the graft surface is nonviable because of\nmarginal cell death, with an additional 9% consisting of the\ngap between plugs. Therefore, approximately one-third of\nthe mosaicplasty surface is not comprised of viable hyaline\ncartilage. This may be an underestimation given that Hang-\nody et al.7 estimated the filling rate for a close-packed circle\nconfiguration to be 80% (as opposed to our calculation of\n91%). Our data suggest that there is scope for improvement\nof mosaicplasty harvest and graft techniques. This may be\nreflected in better long-term graft viability, superior integra-\ntive repair, and, as a result, improved clinical outcomes.\nAppendix\nA detailed description of the planar model is available\nwith the electronic versions of this article, on our web\nsite at jbjs.org (go to the article citation and click on \u201cSup-\nplementary Material\u201d) and on our quarterly CD-ROM (call\nour subscription department, at 781-449-9780, to order the\nCD-ROM). \u0001\nNOTE: The authors thank Mr. I.J.
