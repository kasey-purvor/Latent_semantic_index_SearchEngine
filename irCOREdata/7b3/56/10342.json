Population differentiation showed no significant differences between villages or districts for either species. There was no evidence of geographical clustering of haplotypes. Linkage disequilibrium amongst loci was found only for P. falciparum samples from the seasonal transmission setting.\\ud\n<BR\/>\\ud\n<b>Conclusions:<\/b> The extent of similarity between P. falciparum and P. malariae population structure described by the high level of multiple infection, the lack of significant population differentiation or haplotype clustering and lack of linkage disequilibrium is surprising given the differences in the biological features of these species that suggest a reduced potential for out-crossing and transmission in P. malariae. The absence of a rise in P. malariae MOI with increased transmission or a reduction in MOI with age could be explained by differences in the duration of infection or degree of immunity compared to P. falciparum.<\/dc:description><dc:format>application\/pdf<\/dc:format><dc:identifier>http:\/\/eprints.gla.ac.uk\/50956\/1\/50956.pdf<\/dc:identifier><dc:language>en<\/dc:language><dc:publisher>BioMed Central<\/dc:publisher><dc:source>1475-2875<\/dc:source><dc:subject>QR<\/dc:subject><dc:title>Comparative population structure of <i>Plasmodium malariae<\/i> and <i>Plasmodium falciparum<\/i> under different transmission settings in Malawi<\/dc:title><rioxxterms:author>Bruce, M.C.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Macheso, A.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>McConnachie, A.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Molyneux, M.E.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:publication_date>2011<\/rioxxterms:publication_date><rioxxterms:type>Journal Article\/Review<\/rioxxterms:type><rioxxterms:version>NA<\/rioxxterms:version><rioxxterms:version_of_record>http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1475-2875-10-38<\/rioxxterms:version_of_record><\/rioxx><\/metadata><\/record>","journals":null,"language":{"code":"en","id":9,"name":"English"},"relations":[],"year":2011,"topics":["QR"],"subject":["QR"],"fullText":""}
