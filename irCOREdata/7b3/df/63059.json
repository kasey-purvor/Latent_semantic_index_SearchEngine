The region is also estimated to contain about 10% of the carbon \nstored in land ecosystems, and to account for 10% of global net primary productivity1.  \nThe resilience of the forest to the combined pressures of deforestation and global warming \nis therefore of great concern2, especially since some General Circulation Models (GCMs)  \npredict a severe drying of Amazonia in the 21st century3,4,5. These climate projections are \nconsidered in the light of the 2005 drought in Western Amazonia, which was associated \nwith unusually warm North Atlantic Sea-Surface Temperatures (SSTs)6.  We show that \nreduction of dry season (July-October) rainfall in Western Amazonia is well-correlated \nwith an index of north-south SST gradient across the equatorial Atlantic (\u201cANSG\u201d). Our \nclimate model is unusual amongst current GCMs in being able to reproduce this \nrelationship and also the observed 20th Century multi-decadal variability7 in the ANSG \nwhen the effects of aerosols are included8.  Simulations with the same model for the 21st \nCentury3,8 show a strong tendency for the SST conditions associated with the 2005 drought \nto become much more common due to continuing reductions in reflective aerosol pollution \nin the northern hemisphere9.  \n2 \nIn 2005 large areas of the Amazon river basin experienced one of the most intense drought \nepisodes of the last 100 years6. The drought most directly affected Western Amazonia, and \nespecially the catchments of the Solim\u00f5es and the Madeiras Rivers. Navigation along these \nmajor tributaries had to be suspended because the water levels were so low.  Unlike the El Ni\u00f1o \nrelated droughts in 1926, 1983 and 1997, central and eastern Amazonia were not directly \naffected, although river levels on the Rio Negro in central Amazonia did reach unusually low \nlevels in October 2005 due to reduced inflow from the tributaries to the west.  \nRainfall in Amazonia is sensitive to seasonal, interannual and decadal variations in SSTs7,10,11. \nThe warming of the tropical East Pacific during El Ni\u00f1o events suppresses wet-season rainfall \nthrough modification of the (East-West) Walker Circulation and via the Northern hemisphere \nextra-tropics12. El Ni\u00f1o-like climate change13 has similarly been shown to influence annual \nmean rainfall over South America in GCM climate change projections4,5. \nHowever, variations in Amazonian precipitation are also known to be linked to SSTs in the \ntropical Atlantic11. A warming of the tropical north Atlantic relative to the south leads to a \nnorth-westward shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and compensating \natmospheric descent over Amazonia10.  For north-east Brazil the relationship between the north-\nsouth Atlantic SST gradient and rainfall is sufficiently strong to form the basis for a seasonal \nforecasting system14. Here we show that Atlantic SSTs exert a large influence on \u201cdry-season\u201d \n(July-October) rainfall in Western Amazonia by delaying onset of the South American \nMonsoon15,16.   \nJuly to October 2005 was associated with a persistent warm-anomaly in the north Atlantic17 \ncentred on 10-15oN, and a weaker cold anomaly in the south Atlantic at around 15oS (Figure 1). \nThe absence of a warming in the tropical east Pacific implies that ENSO was in a near neutral \nstate and therefore did not contribute to the 2005 drought. The black box over land in Figure 1 \ndenotes the Western Amazonian area chosen for the purposes of this study (75oW-60oW, 12oS-\n3 \n0oS). The black boxes over the ocean show the north (15oN-35oN, 75oW-30oW) and south (25oS-\n5oS, 40oW-5oE) regions used to calculate an index of the north-south SST gradient across the  \nAtlantic (\u201cAtlantic N-S Gradient (ANSG)\u201d). These areas were chosen for comparability with the \nGCM climate projections to be presented below, but are also near optimal based on a statistical \nanalysis using observations alone18. \nWe analyse results from the HadCM3LC coupled climate-carbon cycle model4, which is based \nupon the Met Office Hadley Centre\u2019s 3rd generation ocean-atmosphere general circulation \nmodel19. This is one of only three current global climate models which fits within the \nobservational limits on the July-October West Amazonian rainfall and ANSG (see \nSupplementary Information). The HadCM3 model has also performed well in GCM \nintercomparison exercises and was recently selected as one of two GCMs which simulate the \nAmazonian climate with reasonable accuracy5. HadCMLC in addition includes dynamic \nvegetation and an interactive carbon cycle, so that atmospheric CO2 concentrations can be \nupdated based on anthropogenic emissions, taking account of the effects of climate change on \nocean and land CO2-uptake. We consider two separate simulations with HadCM3LC for the \nperiod from 1860 to 21004,8. In both cases the model is driven with CO2 emissions consistent \nwith the IS92a scenario, which is approximately in the centre of the spread of future emissions \nrepresented by the more recent SRES scenarios20. Both model experiments also include \nprescribed time-varying concentrations of trace greenhouse gases (CH4, N2O) based on IS92a.  \nThe second run additionally includes changes in tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, solar \nvariability, and most notably forcing from sulphate and volcanic aerosols. This model \nexperiment was able to reproduce the observed warming and CO2 increase over the 20th century \nto good accuracy, especially when a revised estimate of the net CO2 flux from land-use change \nwas used (run \u201cALL70\u201d from ref. 8). \nWe compared the results from these simulations with observations of the ANSG Index17 and \nrainfall in Western Amazonia21 for the 20th century, using 20 year running means in each case \n4 \n(Figure 2). The 2005 ANSG Index value of 4.92 K was exceeded regularly during the 1930s, \n40s and 50s, but has not reached such a high-value since 1960. There is significant variability in \nthe 20-year mean ANSG Index (i.e. much larger than the standard-deviation of the annual mean \nvalues) with values declining from around 1960 to the mid-1980s, before increasing to higher-\nvalues in the last two decades. This variation is mirrored by the decadal-mean West Amazonian \nrainfall measurements, which declined from the 1920s to 1960, then increased until the mid-\n1980s before declining again to the values experienced today.  \nThe two HadCM3LC simulations capture the observed inverse relationship between the ANSG \nIndex and West Amazonian July-August-September-October (\u201cJASO\u201d) precipitation. However, \nthe simulation with greenhouse gases only (red line in Figure 2) fails to reproduce the observed \ndecadal variability in the ANSG Index (correlation coefficient between the 20 year running \nmeans of observed and modelled ANSG is -0.75), instead predicting a near-monotonic increase \nin the ANSG Index and a corresponding near-monotonic decrease in West Amazonian rainfall \nfrom the mid-20th century onwards. However, the HadCM3LC run with aerosols (green line in \nFigure 2) produces a good fit to the decadal variation in the ANSG Index (correlation \ncoefficient between the 20 year running means of +0.82), and reproduces the decline in decadal-\nmean West Amazonian rainfall from the 1920s to 1960. This suggests that longer-term \nvariations in the north-south gradient across the Atlantic, and associated effects on Amazonian \nrainfall, are a consequence of forced as much as internal variability. Furthermore, the two model \nruns taken together indicate that non-greenhouse gas forcing, primarily from anthropogenic and \nvolcanic aerosols, has acted to suppress the development of a stronger north-south gradient \nacross the tropical Atlantic and thereby delayed the suppression of dry season rainfall in \nWestern Amazonia. It seems that reflective sulphate aerosol pollution produced in the northern \nhemisphere may have helped to maintain rainfall in South America, just as it may have \ncontributed to the Sahelian droughts of the 1970s and 1980s22. \n5 \nThe HadCM3LC model also produces a realistic correlation between interannual variations in \nthe West Amazonian rainfall and the ANSG Index (Figure 3). The best-fit straight-lines linking \nthese variables for the model and the observations are very nearly parallel (gradients of -0.65+\/-\n0.29 and  -0.58+\/-0.46 mm day-1 K-1 respectively; here and elsewhere in this paper we quote \nerror bars as +\/- 2 standard deviations giving approximately 95% confidence limits). \nHadCM3LC validates best amongst current GCMs in this respect (see Supplementary \nInformation). In the 21st century the model simulates a strengthening of the relationship between \ndecreasing West Amazonian rainfall for  the July-October period and and an increasing ANSG \nindex, as indicated by the quadratic best-fit shown in Figure 3.  \nOur model simulations suggest that the north Atlantic region will warm more rapidly than the \nsouth Atlantic in the future, leadings to a northward movement of the Intertropical Convergence \nZone and suppression of July-October rainfall in West Amazonia. Aerosol pollution has \noccurred predominantly in the industrialised north, tending to suppress the development of this \nnorth-south warming gradient. However, as air quality improves, aerosol cooling of the climate \nis expected to decline9, potentially revealing a larger north-south gradient across the tropical \nAtlantic. This is evident in the HadCM3LC including aerosols (green line in Figure 2), which \npredicts a 2K increase in the ANSG Index by the end of this century. As a consequence, this \nGCM projection suggests that the conditions of 2005 will be experienced more and more \nfrequently under increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and reducing sulphur \ndioxide emissions in the northern hemisphere (see Supplementary Information). \nClimate model projections are known to differ markedly with regard to regional rainfall changes \nover Amazonia but an intercomparison of the results from twenty GCMs included in the IPCC \n4th Assessment Report  reveals some robust features; (a) there is an across-model relationship \nbetween the 21st century trends in West Amazonian rainfall and the 21st century trends in the \nANSG index - which is consistent with the observed interannual variability in these variables; \nand (b) models which include aerosol forcing tend to have greater increases in the ANSG index \n6 \nin the first few decades of the 21st century (see Supplementary Information, Figure S3). Taken \ntogether, these findings support our basic conclusion that aerosol forcing has delayed reductions \nin Amazonian rainfall, but is unlikely to do so for much longer.  \nWe estimated the probability of a \u201c2005-like\u201d year occurring in the HadCM3LC run with \naerosols, based on the fraction of years in a centred 20-year window that exceed the ANSG \nIndex for 2005 (Figure 4). The model suggests that 2005 was an approximately 1 in 20 year \nevent, but will become a 1 in 2 year occurrence by 2025, and a 9 in 10 year occurrence by 2060. \nThese thresholds obviously depend on the rate of increase of CO2, which is itself dependent on \nthe emissions scenario chosen. Figure 4(b) shows how the probability of a 2005-like event \nincreases as a function of CO2 concentration in HadCM3LC, with the 50% probability crossed \nat about 450ppmv, and the 90% probability crossed at around 610ppmv. These results suggest a \nrapidly increasing risk of 2005-like droughts in Amazonia under conditions of reducing aerosol \nloading and  increasing greenhouse gases.  \n7 \n \nMethods Summary \nThe climate model used was HadCM3LC - a version of HadCM319 which includes an interactive \ncarbon cycle3. Two model runs were carried-out; one with greenhouse gases only3, and one with \ngreenhouse gases plus other key climate forcing factors including anthropogenic sulphate \naerosols8. In both model runs, atmospheric CO2 concentration was modelled interactively by \nspecifying emissions from the IS92a scenario and allowing the carbon cycle model to partition \nthese between ocean, terrestrial and atmospheric carbon pools. Non-CO2 GHGs were prescribed \nto follow a standard IS92a concentration scenario3. The \u201caerosol run\u201d also included revised net \nCO2 emissions from land-use, solar variability, tropospheric and stratospheric ozone changes, \nand the climatic effects of volcanic and anthropogenic aerosols8. \nTo investigate the relative importance of Atlantic and Pacific SST variability for Amazonian \nrainfall, we constructed SST indices from the Hadley Centre \u201cHadISST\" dataset17. The Pacific \nindex was defined as the SST difference between the equatorial West Pacific (5oS-5oN, 120oE-\n180oE) and the Nino 3 region (5oS- 5oN, 150oW-90oW), to remove the impacts of global \nwarming. The Atlantic index used was the \u201cAtlantic North-South Gradient (ANSG)\u201d Index, \ndefined as the SST difference between the tropical North Atlantic (15oN- 35oN, 75oW-30oW) \nand the tropical South Atlantic (25oS-5oS, 40oW-15oE). Time series of precipitation from the \nClimatic Research Unit21 (CRU TS 2.0) were calculated for Western Amazonia (75oW-60oW, \n12oS-0oN). Linear regression analyses were carried-out to determine the relative-sensitivity of \nWestern Amazonian rainfall to the Atlantic and Pacific SST indices. Rainfall in the dry season \n(July-October) was found to be correlated with variability in the ANSG Index, with no \nsignificant dependency on the E-W Pacific SST gradient16. This analysis therefore allowed us to \nfocus on the Atlantic SST anomalies when seeking to understand the Amazonian drought of \nJuly-October 2005. \n8 \nReferences \n1. Melillo, J.M. et al,.

As a result the model requires the use \nof flux corrections. HadCM3LC includes interactive terrestrial and ocean carbon cycle \ncomponents. The terrestrial carbon cycle model, TRIFFID, is a dynamic global vegetation \nmodel, which models carbon allocation between 5 competing plant functional types and a soil \ncarbon reservoir23. The ocean carbon cycle model, HadOCC, includes a representation of \noceanic chemistry and biology24.  \nIn both model runs, atmospheric CO2 concentration was modelled interactively and Non-CO2 \nGHGs were prescribed to follow a standard IS92a concentration scenario3. The \u201caerosol run\u201d in \naddition included8: \n\u00be The direct effect of anthropogenic sulphate aerosol was calculated using an interactive \nsulphur cycle scheme25, driven by historic anthropogenic sulphur dioxide emissions and \n21st Century anthropogenic emissions according to the SRES A2 scenario20. Dry \ndeposition was calculated separately for each of the 5 vegetation types in each gridbox, \nusing CO2-dependent canopy resistance values calculated by the MOSES-2 land-surface \nscheme26.  \n\u00be The first indirect effect of anthropogenic sulphate (i.e. the cloud albedo effect) was \nincluded using a non-interactive method in which cloud albedo perturbations are \nimposed based on output from a set of preliminary sulphur cycle runs25.  \n\u00be Climate forcing due to volcanic eruptions was represented by specifying the \nstratospheric aerosol distribution up to present day27, and assuming it is zero thereafter. \n12 \n\u00be Tropospheric and stratospheric ozone changes were prescribed, based on results from \nthe atmospheric chemistry model, STOCHEM28.  \n\u00be Solar forcing to present day was taken from a reconstruction of solar irradiances29, and \nkept constant (equal to the mean of the last 11 years) after 2000. \n\u00be Revised net CO2 emissions from land-use change8. \nReferences \n23.

Intercomparison of Amazonian Results from CMIP3 Global Climate Models \n  a)  Simulated 20th Century Amazonian Climate \nIn order to put the results from HadCM3LC in context we compare results from twenty global \nclimate models included in the CMIP3 archive (http:\/\/www-pcmdi.llnl.gov\/ipcc\/about_ipcc.php), \nthat form the basis for the model projections included within the IPCC 4th Assessment Report.  \nThe models used here are listed in the caption to figure S1, and described at :  \nhttp:\/\/www-pcmdi.llnl.gov\/ipcc\/model_documentation\/ipcc_model_documentation.php \n \nFigure S1 compares aspects of the mean 20th century Amazonian climate as simulated by the \nCMIP3 models against the observations1,2 , and against the 20th century simulation from the \nHadCM3LC model used in this study3.We use a meaning period of 1950-1999 for the \nobservations to avoid difficulties with sparse Amazonian precipitation data in the first half of \nthe 20th century.  \n \nThe left panel of Figure S1 plots the modelled and observed mean values of the July-October \nWest Amazonian precipitation against the mean values of the July-October ANSG Index (as \ndefined in the caption to Figure 1). The dotted box shows the range of values that fall within \ntwo standard deviations of the observed values. Only two of the CMIP3 models, plus the Hadley \nCentre model used in this study (HadCM3LC \u2013 marked here with a green diamond), fall within \nthese observational constraints.  \n \nThe right panel of Figure S1 shows the linear regression between the interannual variability in \nthe July-October West Amazonian rainfall and the interannual variability in the July-October \nANSG, again versus the mean July-October ANSG. The y-values are equivalent to the gradient \nof the straight-lines shown in Figure 3 (where the continuous line in Figure 3 refers to the \nobservations for 1950-1999, and the dashed-line refers to the HadCM3LC model for 1900-\n1999). The \u201cP vs SST variability\u201d values for the other CMIP3 models were derived in an \nidentical way, i.e. by plotting the West Amazonian precipitation versus the ANSG index for \neach year and calculating the gradient of the best-fit straight-line. More of the CMIP3 models fit \nwithin the observational constraints in this case, in part because the observed mean value of this \nquantity has a relatively large standard deviation. The HadCM3LC model used in this study is \nunusual in being close to the best estimate of both the July-October West Amazonian rainfall, \nand the relationship between the interannual variability in this variable and the interannual \nvariability in the July-October ANSG index.  \n \nb) Simulated 21st Century Amazonian Climate Change \nFigure S2 shows the simulated trends in July-October West Amazonian rainfall and the July-\nOctober ANSG SST index, for each of the CMIP3 GCMs listed in the caption to Figure S1.  \nThe trends were calculated by fitting a quadratic to the annual values for 2000-2075 from \nsimulations driven by the SRES A1B emissions scenario (which includes aerosols). The \nmodels differ markedly in their predictions of trends in these variables, with some models \npredicting increases in Amazonian rainfall and some reductions.  \n \nHowever, there is an across-model relationship between trends in the ANSG index and trends \nin West Amazonian rainfall \u2013 models in which the sub-tropical north Atlantic warms faster \nthan the south tend to predict drying in Amazonia, and vice-versa. The best-fit straight-line \nlinking these model trends of 0.53+\/-0.42 mm day-1 K-1, is similar to the observed interannual \nrelationship between these variables (-0.58+\/-0.46 mm day-1 K-1), suggesting a more robust \nrelationship between the N-S gradient SST gradient in the Atlantic and the onset of the South \nAmerican monsoon. \n \n2 \n \n \nFigure S1 : Validation of GCM simulations of West Amazonian rainfall and the Atlantic N-S SST \ngradient (ANSG) index. The black diamond shows the best estimate from observations1,2, and the dashed \nbox represents plus and minus two standard deviations around this mean. The left panel shows July-\nOctober West Amazonian precipitation versus the ANSG Index. The right panel shows the relationship \nbetween the interannual variability in the rainfall and the interannual variability in the the ANSG versus, \nagain versus the mean ANSG. The green diamond shows the results obtained with the GCM used in this \nstudy3.

The gradient of the overall best-fit \nstraight-line is -0.53+\/-0.42 mm day-1 K-1, which is similar to the observed interannual relationship \nbetween these variables (-0.58+\/-0.46 mm day-1 K-1) .  \n3 \nc) Effect of Aerosols on 21st Century Trends in the ANSG \nIt is apparent from Figure S2 that the CMIP3 models differ in the trends they project for West \nAmazonian rainfall and the ANSG SST index. However, the ensemble of model results support \nthe hypothesis that increases in the ANSG index will reduce the July-October West Amazonian \nrainfall, in a manner similar to that experienced in 2005. Furthermore, these same models \ncollectively produce a delay in warming of the north Atlantic relative to the south (as measured \nby the ANSG index) when aerosols are included in the climate simulations. \n \nFigure S3 compares the trends in the July-October ANSG in simulations which either include \n(green lines) or exclude (red lines) the effects of aerosols. The lines are produced as means \nacross the twenty CMIP3 models, smoothed using a 20-year running mean. The red lines come \nfrom simulations with an imposed 1% per year increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, and \nthe green lines come from simulations consistent with the SRES A1B emissions scenario \n(including aerosol effects). Although these simulations are driven by different greenhouse gas \nconcentrations they reach similar levels of total radiative forcing. We plot them on the same \ntime axes to highlight the impact of anthropogenic aerosol pollution on the predicted evolution \nof the ANSG.  The mean of the CO2-only runs produces a negligible change in the ANSG in the \nfuture. In contrast the A1B runs show an upward trend in the first half of the 21st century from a \nminimum at around 1990. These results suggests that aerosols have acted to delay increases in \nthe ANSG, but will cease to do so if anthropogenic sulphate emissions decline in the manner \nexpected over the next 50 years. \n \n \n \nFigure S3 : Mean trends in the Atlantic N-S SST gradient (ANSG) index as simulated by models with \n(green line) and without (red line) sulphate aerosol forcing. These lines were calculated as 20-year \nrunning means across the twenty GCMs listed in the caption to Figure S1, using results from simulations \ndriven by a prescribed 1% per year increase in CO2 (red) and runs driven by the SRES A1B emissions \nscenario including aerosols (green).  \n4 \n \n2.  Simulation of 20th Century Variation in the ANSG by HadCM3LC \nFigure S4 compares the observed1 and modelled3 (with HadCM3LC) evolution of the Atlantic \nN-S SST gradient (ANSG) through the 20th century. In both cases the y-axis is a 20-year \nrunning mean anomaly relative to the mean ANSG value over the period 1901-1951. The left \nhand panel is therefore essentially a magnification of Figure 2(a) showing just the period 1900-\n2000, and with the error in the model mean corrected. The right panel is a scatter plot of these \nmodelled ANSG anomalies versus the ANSG anomalies as observed.  \n \nThe model used in this study performs well in reproducing the long-term trends in the ANSG. \nThe downward trend of the ANSG from 1900 to 1920 is well simulated, as is the subsequent \nupward trend until around 1960. The sharp drop in the ANSG from 1960 to 1980 and the \nincrease from 1980 to the end of the century are slightly late in the model. However, it is \nremarkable that the overall shape of the observed variation in the ANSG can be reproduced so \nwell in a relatively low-resolution climate model without detailed ocean-state initialisation. This \nsuggests that decadal variability in the subtropical Atlantic is strongly forced by anthropogenic \nand volcanic aerosols.  \n \n \n \nFigure S4: Observed and simulated variation in 20 year running-mean north-south SST gradient across \nthe Atlantic ocean through the 20th century (as an anomaly relative to the respective means over the \nperiod 1901-1951). Observations are shown in black1,2 and the model used in this study is shown in \ngreen3 (left panel). The right panel shows the same data but as a scatter plot of the modelled versus \npredicted anomaly in the ANSG index.  \nReferences \n1. Rayner N.A. et al. .
