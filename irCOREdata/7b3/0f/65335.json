PARKER AND IOANNIS D. PLATIS\nAbstract. Let \u03a3 be a closed, orientable surface of genus g. It is known that the SU(2, 1) represen-\ntation variety of pi1(\u03a3) has 2g\u2212 3 components of (real) dimension 16g\u2212 16 and two components of\ndimension 8g\u22126. Of special interest are the totally loxodromic, faithful (that is quasi-Fuchsian) rep-\nresentations. In this paper we give global real analytic coordinates on a subset of the representation\nvariety that contains the quasi-Fuchsian representations. These coordinates are a natural general-\nisation of Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates on the Teichmu\u00a8ller space of \u03a3 and complex Fenchel-Nielsen\ncoordinates on the (classical) quasi-Fuchsian space of \u03a3.\n1. Introduction\nIn their famous manuscript, recently published as [5], Fenchel and Nielsen gave global coordinates\nfor the Teichmu\u00a8ller space of a closed surface \u03a3 of genus g \u2265 2. These coordinates are defined as\nfollows; see also Wolpert [26], [27]. First, let \u03b3j for j = 1, . . . , 3g \u2212 3 be a maximal collection of\ndisjoint, simple, closed curves on \u03a3 that are neither homotopic to each other nor homotopically\ntrivial. We call such a collection a curve system; it is also called a partition by some authors. The\ncomplement of such a curve system is a collection of 2g \u2212 2 three-holed spheres, or pairs of pants.\nIf \u03a3 has a hyperbolic metric then, without loss of generality, we may choose each \u03b3j in our curve\nsystem to be the geodesic in its homotopy class. The hyperbolic metric on each three-holed sphere\nis completely determined by the hyperbolic length lj > 0 of each of its boundary geodesics. Each\n\u03b3j is in the boundary of exactly two three-holed spheres (including the case where it corresponds\nto two boundary curves of the same three-holed sphere). There is a twist parameter kj \u2208 R that\ndetermines how these three-holed spheres are attached to one another. This is defined as follows. On\neach three-holed sphere with its hyperbolic metric, take disjoint orthogonal geodesic arcs between\neach pair of boundary geodesics. On each geodesic \u03b3j, the feet of these perpendiculars on the same\nside are diametrically opposite. The twist parameter kj measures the hyperbolic distance along \u03b3j\nbetween the feet of the perpendiculars on opposite sides. As we have just defined it, the parameter\nkj lies between \u00b1lj\/2. Performing a Dehn twist about \u03b3j adds \u00b1lj to kj, the sign depending on the\ndirection of twist. Thus we can make the twist parameter a well defined real number with reference\nto an initial homotopy class. The theorem of Fenchel and Nielsen states that each (6g \u2212 6)-tuple\n(l1, . . . , l3g\u22123, k1, . . . , k3g\u22123) \u2208 R\n3g\u22123\n+ \u00d7R\n3g\u22123\ndetermines a unique hyperbolic metric on \u03a3 and each hyperbolic metric arises in this way.\nWe will take the point of view that Teichmu\u00a8ller space is the collection of discrete, faithful, purely\nloxodromic representations of \u03c01(\u03a3) to SL(2,R), up to conjugation. In this case the discreteness of\nthe representation follows from the fact that it is totally loxodromic, but we include discreteness as\na hypothesis for emphasis. Wolpert gives a careful description of the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates\nfor Riemann surfaces in [26]. Given such a representation, the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates may be\ncomputed directly from the matrices; see [14] for an explicit way to do this. The length parameters\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 32G05,32M05.\nJRP was partly supported by a CNRS position held at the University of Paris VI. IDP was supported by a\nMarie Curie Intra-European fellowship (Contract No.MEIF-CT-2003-500074) within the 6th Community Framework\nProgramme.\n1\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 2\nlj may read off from the traces of the corresponding matrices and the twist parameters kj from\ncross-ratios of certain combinations of fixed points. Note that all these quantities are conjugation\ninvariant. We also remark that it is not possible to determine the representation up to conjugacy\nby merely using 6g \u2212 6 trace parameters, in fact one needs 6g \u2212 5; see [16] and [19].\nIn [12] and [20] Kourouniotis and Tan defined complex Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates on the quasi-\nFuchsian space of \u03a3, in which both the length parameters and the twist parameters become complex.\nThe group elements corresponding to \u03b3j in the curve system are now loxodromic with, in general,\nnon-real trace. Thus the imaginary part of the length parameter represents the holonomy angle\nwhen moving around \u03b3j. Likewise, the imaginary part of the twist parameter becomes the parameter\nof a bending deformation about \u03b3j ; see also [18] for more details of this correspondence and how\nto relate these parameters to traces of matrices. The main difference from the situation with\nreal Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates is that, while distinct quasi-Fuchsian representations determine\ndistinct complex Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates, it is not at all clear which set of coordinates give rise\nto discrete representations, and hence to a quasi-Fuchsian structure. In fact the boundary of the\nset of realisable coordinates is fractal.\nAnother generalisation of Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates is given by Goldman in [8], where he\nconsiders the space of convex real projective structures on a compact surface. There he constructs\n16g \u2212 16 real parameters. Goldman uses two real parameters generalising the length of each \u03b3j\nand two real parameters generalising the twist parameters. Which gives 12g \u2212 12 in total. For\nthe remaining 4g \u2212 4 parameters, Goldman shows that one must associate an additional two real\nparameters to each three-holed sphere.\nThe purpose of this paper is to define analogous Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates for complex hyper-\nbolic quasi-Fuchsian representations of surface groups, that is discrete, faithful, totally loxodromic\nrepresentations; see [17]. (Once again a totally loxodromic representation is automatically discrete.)\nIn this setting the representation space, and hence the quasi-Fuchsian space, is more complicated.\nThere is a natural invariant of representations of surface groups to SU(2, 1), called the Toledo\ninvariant; see [21]. The Toledo invariant is an even integer lying in the interval [\u03c7,\u2212\u03c7], where\n\u03c7 = \u03c7(\u03a3) is the Euler characteristic of \u03a3; see [9]. Moreover, the Toledo invariant distinguishes the\ncomponents of the SU(2, 1) representations variety; see [28]. Each component contains discrete,\nfaithful, totally loxodromic representations; see [9]. A representation preserves a complex line if\nand only if its Toledo invariant equals \u00b1\u03c7; see [21]. The corresponding two components comprise\nreducible representations and they are the direct product of Teichmu\u00a8ller space (within the complex\nline) and representations of \u03c01(\u03a3) to U(1) (rotations around the complex line). The representa-\ntion is reducible and the corresponding components have dimension 8g \u2212 6; see Theorem 6(d) of\nGoldman [7]. The remaining components correspond to itteducible representations and so, using\nWeil\u2019s formula [22] their dimension is 16g \u2212 16; see also Lemma 1 of [7].\nThe definition of the Toledo invariant uses an equivariant embedding of the universal cover of\nthe surface \u03a3 (that is the hyperbolic plane) into complex hyperbolic space. We do not explicitly use\nthis surface. However, we will have this embedding in the backs of our minds when we use phrases\nlike \u2018attaching groups along peripheral elements\u2019 and \u2018closing a handle\u2019. These phrases are carried\nover from plane hyperbolic geometry and do not make direct sense in four dimensions, although we\ncould make them precise by using equivariant embeddings of the surfaces in question.\nSuppose that we are given a curve system \u03b31, . . . , \u03b33g\u22123 on a closed surface \u03a3 of genus g \u2265 2,\nas described above. We consider representations \u03c01(\u03a3) to SU(2, 1) for which the 3g \u2212 3 group\nelements representing the \u03b3j are all loxodromic with distinct fixed points. It is clear that this is a\nproper subset of the representation variety; but this subset contains all (discrete) faithful, totally\nloxodromic representations. That is, it contains the complex hyperbolic quasi-Fuchsian space.\nIn fact, we restrict our attention to a particular type of curve systems. Namely, we suppose that\nthere are g of the curves \u03b3j that correspond to two boundary components of the same three-holed\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 3\nsphere. We call such a curve system simple. See Figure 2.1 for an example of a simple curve system.\nThis restriction makes our computations easier and should not be necessary in general.\nOur goal is to describe 16g\u221216 real parameters that distinguish non-conjugate irreducible repre-\nsentations and 8g\u22126 real parameters that distinguish non-conjugate representations that preserve a\ncomplex line. As with the complex Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates described by Kourouniotis and Tan\nit is not clear which coordinates correspond to discrete representations. However, our coordinates\ndetermine the group up to conjugacy and distinguish between non-conjugate representations.\nThe major innovation in this paper is the use of cross-ratios in addition to complex length and\ntwist-bend parameters. Following Kora\u00b4nyi and Reimann [11], there are 24 complex cross-ratios\nassociated to the different permutations of four ordered points. Certain permutations of the four\npoints preserve these cross ratios or send them to their complex conjugate, to their reciprocal or\nto their conjugate reciprocal; see either page 225 of [6] or else [25]. After taking account of these\nsymmetries, one is left with three complex cross-ratios. Falbel [2] shows that these satisfy two real\nequations and so lie on a real four-dimensional variety in C3. This variety is Falbel\u2019s cross-ratio\nvariety which we denote by X. Moreover, following Falbel, these three cross-ratios determine the\nfour ordered points up to SU(2, 1) equivalence.\nIn the case where our representation does not preserve a complex line, we assign parameters as\nfollows. To each of the 2g \u2212 2 three-holed spheres we associate two complex traces and a point on\nX. This gives eight real parameters. These 16g \u2212 16 real parameters are subject to 3g\u2212 3 complex\nconstraints that are compatibility conditions for gluing the three-holed spheres together. This\nreduces the number of independent parameters to 10g \u2212 10. There are then 3g \u2212 3 complex twist-\nbend parameters, one associated to each gluing operation. This gives 16g \u2212 16 real parameters in\ntotal; see Theorem 2.1. This parameter count is the same as Goldman\u2019s [8], but his real parameters\nare not combined into complex numbers.\nRepresentations that preserve a complex line are reducible. A result analogous to Theorem 2.1\nmay be deduced by splitting the representation to one in SU(1, 1) and one in U(1). The first\ncorresponds to a point in Teichmu\u00a8ller space and is determined by 6g \u2212 6 real parameters (for\nexample Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates). The second is abelian and is completely determined by 2g\nreal parameters, for example the arguments of the generators. In Theorem 2.2 we show that certain\nof our parameters are real in this case and the parameters analogous to those indicated in Theorem\n2.1 give 8g \u2212 6 real parameters that completely determine \u03c1 : \u03c01(\u03a3) \u2212\u2192 \u0393 < S\n(\nU(1) \u00d7U(1, 1)\n)\nup\nto conjugation.\nThe paper is organised as follows. We give the statements of the main results in Section 2.\nAfter covering the necessary background material in Section 3 we discuss loxodromic isometries in\nsome detail, Section 4. Following this we discuss the properties of Kora\u00b4nyi-Reimann cross-ratios and\nCartan angular invariants in Section 5. In Section 6 we show how to associate a point on X to a pair\nof loxodromic maps A and B and we investigate the relationship between cross-ratios and traces of\nelements of \u3008A,B\u3009. We are then able to begin to discuss Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates. We begin with\ncoordinates for three-holed spheres, Section 7, and then go on to discuss in Section 8 the twist-bend\nparameters that describe the ways to glue three-holed spheres to form four-holed spheres or one-\nholed tori. This completes the list of ingredients necessary for Section 2. Additionally, in Section\n7.3 we investigate what happens if we only use traces (that is complex lengths) to parametrise\nthree-holed spheres. We show that it is not sufficient to use four traces, but we must use five traces\nsubject to two real equations.\nA large fraction of this paper is devoted to both showing that other possible coordinates do\nnot work (Section 7.3) and also treating the special case where the group preserves a complex line\n(Sections 2.2, 5.4, 6.3 and 8.4). Readers who do not want to go into this material may by-pass it\nas follows. A good overview can be obtained by reading the outline in Section 2.1; the background\nmaterial in Sections 3, 4, 5.1 and 5.2 and then Sections 6.1, 7.1, 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3. However, this\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 4\nFigure 2.1. An example of a simple curve system.\nreading scheme omits certain crucial results, for example Proposition 5.10, which could be assumed\nfrom Falbel\u2019s work [2].\nPart of this work was carried out while both authors were visiting the University of Paris VI,\nwhere we had many useful discussions. We would particularly like to thank Elisha Falbel for\npointing out a subtle, but serious, error in an earlier version of this manuscript. We would also like\nto thank the referee for giving us useful suggestions for improving the paper.\n2. Complex hyperbolic Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates\n2.1. Representations that do not preserve a complex line. We now summarise our con-\nstruction of Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates for complex hyperbolic quasi-Fuchsian surface groups. For\nthe details the reader should see subsequent sections and we give precise references as we go along.\nAs mentioned in the introduction we only consider curve systems with the property that each\nhandle is closed from inside the same three-holed sphere, and we call such a curve system simple;\nsee Figure 2.1 for an example of a simple curve system. Given a simple curve system on a closed\nRiemann surface of genus g we consider representations of the fundamental group so that each curve\nin our system is represented by a loxodromic map; see Section 4 for more details about loxodromic\nisometries. The restriction that our curve system is simple should not be necessary in general. In\nthe classical case the effect of a change of curve system has been investigated by Okai [15]. This\ncould probably be extended to the complex hyperbolic setting, but we will not pursue it here.\nThe good thing about simple curve systems is that the surface may be built up using the following\nrecursive process. Begin with a single three-holed sphere. Attach a second three-holed sphere along\na boundary curve. In order to do this, two of the boundary curves, one from each three-holed\nsphere, must be compatible. The result is a four-holed sphere. Keep adding pairs of three-holed\nspheres so that at each stage the boundary curves are grouped in pairs and each pair belong to the\nsame three-holed sphere. Eventually one ends up with 2g\u22122 three-holed spheres attached together\nto form a 2g-holed sphere. These 2g holes naturally come in pairs, each pair belonging to the same\nthree-holed sphere. For each such pair we close the handle. The result is a surface of genus g that\nis naturally made up of 2g \u2212 2 three-holed spheres attached along 3g \u2212 3 curves \u03b3j and it is these\ncurves that make up our curve system, which by construction is simple. At each stage we have\nrequired that the boundary components that are attached are compatible, both when adding new\nthree-holed spheres and when closing handles.\nThis way of using three-holed spheres to build up our surface with a simple curve system is\nvery well adapted to the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates we shall construct. In this section we will\nexamine how this works for representations of \u03c01(\u03a3) that do not preserve a complex line. Each\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 5\nthree-holed sphere corresponds to a (0, 3) group and this is described up to conjugation by eight\nreal parameters (locally by four complex parameters): namely two complex traces and a point on\na cross-ratio variety; see Theorem 7.1. When attaching two (0, 3) groups together to form a (0, 4)\ngroup we require that two of the peripheral elements are compatible (that is one is conjugate to the\ninverse of the other); see Section 8.1 for a discussion of compatibility. This gives one fewer complex\ndegree of freedom. However, there is one complex parameter associated to the attaching process,\nnamely the Fenchel-Nielsen twist-bend. Thus there are still sixteen real parameters describing an\nattached pair of (0, 3) groups (that is eight for each (0, 3) group); see Theorem 8.4. Continuing\nin the same way, each (0, 3) group we attach is described by eight real parameters, two of which\nare constrained by the compatibility condition. But there is one complex degree of freedom in\nthe attaching process. Thus once we have attached all 2g \u2212 2 of our (0, 3) groups we will have\n8 \u00b7 (2g \u2212 2) = 16g \u2212 16 real parameters. In order to close the g handles we need to impose the\ncompatibility condition on each of the g pairs of boundary curves. These g complex constraints\nreduce our number of real parameters to 14g\u221216. But there are g complex twist-bend parameters,\none for each handle we close; see Theorem 8.6. This gives a grand total of 16g\u221216 real parameters.\nThis is the number we require.\nWe call the resulting coordinates complex hyperbolic Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates for the group\n\u0393 = \u03c1\n(\n\u03c01(\u03a3)\n)\n. Specifically, these coordinates are the 3g \u2212 3 complex twist-bend parameters; the\n4g \u2212 4 complex traces and 2g \u2212 2 points on the cross-ratio variety X, all subject to 3g \u2212 3 complex\nconstraints. It remains to check that these are independent and that they completely determine\nour representations up to conjugacy. Our main theorem is the following:\nTheorem 2.1. Let \u03a3 be a surface of genus g with a simple curve system \u03b31, . . . , \u03b33g\u22123. Let\n\u03c1 : \u03c01(\u03a3) \u2212\u2192 \u0393 < SU(2, 1) be a representation of the fundamental group of \u03a3 with the property that\n\u03c1(\u03b3j) = Aj is loxodromic for each j = 1, . . . , 3g \u2212 3. Suppose that \u0393 does not preserve a complex\nline. Then the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates of \u03c1 are independent and two representations have the\nsame Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates of and only if they are conjugate in SU(2, 1).\nProof. This theorem will follow from the results we prove below. In Theorem 7.1 we show that\nthe representations of each (0, 3) group may be parametrised by the trace of two peripheral curves\nand a point of the corresponding cross-ratio variety. For each (0, 3) group we may choose the two\nperipheral curves in three ways. Making a different choice corresponds to an analytic change of\ncoordinates; see Theorem 7.2. This gives a total of 4g\u22124 traces and 2g\u22122 points in the cross-ratio\nvariety (which has four real dimensions). The compatibility conditions when gluing impose 3g \u2212 3\ncomplex conditions on these parameters. There are 3g \u2212 3 twist-bend parameters \u03baj , each in C\nwith \u2212\u03c0 < \u2111(\u03baj) \u2264 \u03c0. The only relations between the parameters in adjacent (0, 3) groups are the\ncompatibility conditions. There are no relations between parameters in non-adjacent (0, 3) groups.\nThus, all other parameters are independent.\nNow suppose we have two representations with the same coordinates. The coordinates of each\nthree-holed sphere are the same in both representations and so they are pairwise conjugate; see\nTheorem 7.1. But when gluing across each curve in the system the resulting (0, 4) group or (1, 1)\ngroup is determined up to conjugation; see Theorems 8.4 and 8.6. Thus the whole group is deter-\nmined up to conjugation.\nConversely, suppose we have two representations that are conjugate. By definition, the traces\ntr(Aj) are the same. This is also true of the parameters Xl provided we have chosen cross-ratios\nof corresponding points. If not, then one cross-ratio, together with three length coordinates, deter-\nmines all other cross-ratios for that particular (0, 3) group by a real analytic change of coordinates;\nsee Proposition 7.5. Finally, we know that the twist-bend parameters are the same.\nThis proves the result. \u0003\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 6\n2.2. Representations preserving a complex line. The two components of the representation\nvariety with extreme Toledo invariant are made up of groups that preserve a complex line. These\nrepresentations are reducible and the components have real dimension 8g \u2212 6. Specifically, the\ncomponents are a direct product of Teichmu\u00a8ller space, of dimension 6g \u2212 6, and 2g copies of U(1).\nIn this section we describe what happens to our Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates in this case.\nLet Aj = \u03c1(\u03b3j) be the group elements representing the simple closed curves \u03b3j in our simple\ncurve system. These 3g\u22123 curves fall into two classes. First, there are 2g\u22123 curves used to attach\ndistinct three-holed spheres and, secondly, there are g curves used to close handles. In Proposition\n6.8 we show that, if \u03b3j is 2g \u2212 3 curves used to attach distinct three-holed spheres, then tr(Aj) is\nreal. Furthermore, there can be no bending across such curves; see the discussion in Section 8.2.\nHence, each of these 2g\u22123 complex twist-bend parameters \u03baj is forced to be a real twist parameter\nkj (which is just the classical Fenchel-Nielsen twist).\nAdditionally, the cross-ratios are all real and satisfy certain equations; see Proposition 5.13.\nMoreover, arguing as in Proposition 7.6, we may express this cross-ratio in terms of the traces. In\nfact, using the notation of Proposition 7.6, in this case we have\nX1(A,B) =\n(tr(AB)\u2212 \u03c4(\u03bb\u2212 \u00b5))\n(e\u03bb \u2212 e\u2212\u03bb)(e\u00b5 \u2212 e\u2212\u00b5)\n.\nThus in this case there are no independent cross-ratio parameters.\nThus we have proved that when \u03c1\n(\n\u03c01(\u03a3)\n)\npreserves a complex line the Fenchel-Nielsen coor-\ndinates from Theorem 2.1 have degenerated as follows. First there are 2g complex parameters,\nnamely the complex length and twist-bend parameters \u03bbj and \u03baj for j = 1, . . . , g associated to\ncurves \u03b3j that are used to close a handle. Then there are 4g\u22126 real parameters, namely the length\nand twist parameters lj and kj for j = g + 1, . . . , 3g \u2212 3 associated to the other curves in the\nsystem. We call these the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates for \u03c1.\nIn fact lj and kj for j = 1, . . . , 3g \u2212 3 (where lj = \u211c(\u03bbj) and kj = \u211c(\u03baj) for j = 1, . . . , g)\nare just the classical Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates on the Teichmu\u00a8ller space of \u03a3. The other 2g\nparameters correspond to rotations around the complex line fixed by \u0393. They may be thought of\nas a (necessarily abelian) representation of \u03c01(\u03a3) into U(1). The stabiliser of a complex line is\nisomorphic to S(U(1)\u00d7U(1, 1)\n)\n, the first factor corresponding to rotation around the complex line\nand the second to isometries of the hyperbolic metric on the complex line. These representations\nare clearly independent. Thus we have proved:\nTheorem 2.2. Let \u03a3 be a surface of genus g with a simple curve system \u03b31, . . . , \u03b33g\u22123. Let\n\u03c1 : \u03c01(\u03a3) \u2212\u2192 \u0393 < SU(2, 1) be a representation of the fundamental group of \u03a3 preserving a complex\nline and with the property that \u03c1(\u03b3j) = Aj is loxodromic for each j = 1, . . . , 3g \u2212 3. Then, the\nFenchel-Nielsen coordinates of \u03c1 are independent and two representations have the same Fenchel-\nNielsen coordinates of and only if they are conjugate in SU(2, 1).\n3. Preliminaries\n3.1. Complex Hyperbolic Space. Let C2,1 be the vector space C3 with the Hermitian form of\nsignature (2, 1) given by\n\u3008z,w\u3009 = w\u2217Jz = z1w3 + z2w2 + z2w1\nwith matrix\nJ =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0 0 0 10 1 0\n1 0 0\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb .\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 7\nWe consider the following subspaces of C2,1:\nV\u2212 =\n{\nz \u2208 C2,1 : \u3008z, z\u3009 < 0\n}\n,\nV0 =\n{\nz \u2208 C2,1 \u2212 {0} : \u3008z, z\u3009 = 0\n}\n.\nLet P : C2,1 \u2212 {0} \u2212\u2192 CP 2 be the canonical projection onto complex projective space. Then\ncomplex hyperbolic space H2\nC\nis defined to be PV\u2212 and its boundary \u2202H\n2\nC\nis PV0. Specifically,\nC\n2,1 \u2212 {0} may be covered with three charts H1, H2, H3 where Hj comprises those points in\nC\n2,1 \u2212 {0} for which zj 6= 0. It is clear that V\u2212 is contained in H3. The canonical projection from\nH3 to C\n2 is given by P(z) = (z1\/z3, z2\/z3) = z. Therefore we can write H\n2\nC\n= P(V\u2212) as\nH2C =\n{\n(z1, z2) \u2208 C\n2 : 2\u211c(z1) + |z2|\n2 < 0\n}\n.\nThere are distinguished points in V0 which we denote by o and \u221e:\no =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f000\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb , \u221e =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f010\n0\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb .\nThen V0 \u2212{\u221e} is contained in H3 and V0 \u2212{o} (in particular \u221e) is contained in H1. Let Po = o\nand P\u221e =\u221e. Then we can write \u2202H2\nC\n= P(V0) as\n\u2202H2C \u2212 {\u221e} =\n{\n(z1, z2) \u2208 C\n2 : 2\u211c(z1) + |z2|\n2 = 0\n}\n.\nIn particular o = (0, 0) \u2208 C2. In this manner, H2\nC\nis the Siegel domain in C2; see [6].\nConversely, given a point z of C2 = P(H3) \u2282 CP\n2 we may lift z = (z1, z2) to a point z in\nH3 \u2282 C\n2,1, called the standard lift of z, by writing z in non-homogeneous coordinates as\nz =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0z1z2\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb .\nThe Bergman metric on H2\nC\nis defined by the distance function \u03c1 given by the formula\ncosh2\n(\n\u03c1(z,w)\n2\n)\n=\n\u3008z,w\u3009 \u3008w, z\u3009\n\u3008z, z\u3009 \u3008w,w\u3009\n=\n\u2223\u2223\u3008z,w\u3009\u2223\u22232\n|z|2|w|2\nwhere z and w in V\u2212 are the standard lifts of z and w in H\n2\nC\nand |z| =\n\u221a\n\u2212\u3008z, z\u3009. Alternatively,\nds2 = \u2212\n4\n\u3008z, z\u30092\ndet\n[\n\u3008z, z\u3009 \u3008dz, z\u3009\n\u3008z, dz\u3009 \u3008dz, dz\u3009\n]\n.\nThe holomorphic sectional curvature of H2\nC\nequals \u22121 and its real sectional curvature is pinched\nbetween \u22121 and \u22121\/4.\nThere are no totally geodesic, real hypersurfaces of H2\nC\n, but there are are two kinds of totally\ngeodesic 2-dimensional subspaces of complex hyperbolic space, (see Section 3.1.11 of [6]). Namely:\n(i) complex lines L, which have constant curvature \u22121, and\n(ii) totally real Lagrangian planes R, which have constant curvature \u22121\/4.\nBoth of these subspaces are isometrically embedded copies of the hyperbolic plane.\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 8\n3.2. Isometries. Let U(2, 1) be the group of unitary matrices for the Hermitian form \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009. Each\nsuch matrix A satisfies the relation A\u22121 = JA\u2217J where A\u2217 is the Hermitian transpose of A.\nThe full group of holomorphic isometries of complex hyperbolic space is the projective unitary\ngroup PU(2, 1) = U(2, 1)\/U(1), where U(1) = {ei\u03b8I, \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0)} and I is the 3\u00d7 3 identity matrix.\nFor our purposes we shall consider instead the group SU(2, 1) of matrices which are unitary with\nrespect to \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009, and have determinant 1. Therefore PU(2, 1) = SU(2, 1)\/{I, \u03c9I, \u03c92I}, where \u03c9 is\na non real cube root of unity, and so SU(2, 1) is a 3-fold covering of PU(2, 1). This is the direct\nanalogue of the fact that SL(2,C) is the double cover of PSL(2,C).\nEvery complex line L is the image under some A \u2208 SU(2, 1) of the complex line where the\nsecond coordinate is zero. The subgroup of SU(2, 1) stabilising this particular complex line is thus\n(conjugate to) the group of block diagonal matrices S\n(\nU(1) \u00d7U(1, 1)\n)\n< SU(2, 1). Similarly, every\nLagrangian plane is the image under some element of SU(2, 1) of the Lagrangian plane RR where\nboth coordinates are real. This is preserved by the subgroup of SU(2, 1) comprising matrices with\nreal entries, that is SO(2, 1) < SU(2, 1).\nHolomorphic isometries of H2\nC\nare classified as follows:\n(i) An isometry is loxodromic if it fixes exactly two points of \u2202H2\nC\n, one of which is attracting\nand the other repelling.\n(ii) An isometry is parabolic if it fixes exactly one point of \u2202H2\nC\n.\n(iii) An isometry is elliptic if it fixes at least one point of H2\nC\n.\n4. Loxodromic Isometries\n4.1. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of loxodromic matrices. Let A \u2208 SU(2, 1) be a matrix\nrepresenting a loxodromic isometry. By definition A has an attracting fixed point. From the\nmatrix point of view, this means that A has an eigenvalue e\u03bb with |e\u03bb| = e\u211c(\u03bb) > 1. In other words\n\u211c(\u03bb) > 0. Since elements of SU(2, 1) preserve the Hermitian form, it is not hard to show that if e\u03bb\nis an eigenvalue of A then so is e\u2212\u03bb (Lemma 6.2.5 of [6]) and since det(A) = 1, its third eigenvalue\nmust be e\u03bb\u2212\u03bb. We may also assume that \u2111(\u03bb) \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0] and, in this way, \u03bb \u2208 S where S is the\nregion defined by:\n(4.1) S =\n{\n\u03bb \u2208 C : \u211c(\u03bb) > 0, \u2111(\u03bb) \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0]\n}\n.\nLet aA \u2208 \u2202H\n2\nC\nbe the attractive fixed point of A. Then any lift aA of aA to V0 is an eigenvector\nof A and the corresponding eigenvalue is e\u03bb with \u03bb \u2208 S. Likewise, if rA \u2208 \u2202H\n2\nC\nis the repelling\nfixed point of A, then any lift rA of rA to V0 is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue e\n\u2212\u03bb. The fixed\npoints aA and rA span a complex line LA in H\n2\nC\n, called the complex axis of A. The geodesic joining\nrA and aA is called the real axis of A. The eigenvector nA of A corresponding to e\n\u03bb\u2212\u03bb is a polar\nvector to the complex axis of A.\nFor any \u03bb \u2208 C with \u2212\u03c0 < \u2111(\u03bb) \u2264 \u03c0 define E(\u03bb) by\n(4.2) E(\u03bb) =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0e\n\u03bb 0 0\n0 e\u03bb\u2212\u03bb 0\n0 0 e\u2212\u03bb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\nIt is easy to check that E(\u03bb) is in SU(2, 1) for all \u03bb. If \u03bb \u2208 S then E = E(\u03bb) is a loxodromic map\nwith attractive eigenvalue e\u03bb and fixed points aE = \u221e, rE = o. If \u211c(\u03bb) = 0 then E(\u03bb) is elliptic\n(or the identity) and fixes the complex line spanned by o and \u221e. If \u211c(\u03bb) < 0 then \u2212\u03bb \u2208 S and\nE(\u03bb) is a loxodromic map with attractive eigenvalue e\u2212\u03bb and fixed points aE = o, rE =\u221e.\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 9\nLet A be a general loxodromic map with attracting eigenvalue e\u03bb for \u03bb \u2208 S. Since SU(2, 1) acts\n2-transitively on \u2202H2\nC\nthen there exists a Q \u2208 SU(2, 1) whose columns are projectively aA, nA, rA.\nMoreover, aA = Q(\u221e) and rA = Q(o). Thus we may write: A = QE(\u03bb)Q\n\u22121, where E(\u03bb) is given\nby (4.2).\nIf A lies in SO(2, 1) and corresponds to a loxodromic isometry of the hyperbolic plane then \u03bb is\nreal and so tr(A) = 2 cosh(\u03bb) + 1 is real and greater than 3. If \u2111(\u03bb) = \u03c0 then A corresponds to a\nhyperbolic glide reflection on H2\nR\nand tr(A) = \u22122 cosh(\u211c(\u03bb)) + 1 < \u22121.\n4.2. The trace function for a loxodromic matrix. Let A be a loxodromic matrix and let e\u03bb\nbe its attracting eigenvalue, where \u03bb \u2208 S. As indicated in Section 4.1 the other eigenvalues are e\u2212\u03bb\nand e\u03bb\u2212\u03bb and so the trace of A is given by the following function of \u03bb which we denote by \u03c4(\u03bb):\n(4.3) tr(A) = \u03c4(\u03bb) = e\u03bb + e\u03bb\u2212\u03bb + e\u2212\u03bb.\nThis generalises the well known formula tr(A) = e\u03bb + e\u2212\u03bb for SL(2,C). However our function \u03c4(\u03bb)\nis not holomorphic. It is easy to see that \u03c4(\u03bb) has the following properties:\n(i) \u03c4 is a real analytic function of \u03bb.\n(ii) \u03c4(\u2212\u03bb) = \u03c4(\u03bb).\n(iii) \u03c4(\u03bb+ 2\u03c0i) = \u03c4(\u03bb).\nThe latter two properties prevent \u03c4 from being one-to-one in the whole of C. We therefore restrict\nour attention to those \u03bb lying in the strip S defined by (4.1). We now determine the image in C of\nS under \u03c4 . In order to do so, following Goldman \u00a76.2.3 of [6], we define the function f : C \u2212\u2192 R\nby\n(4.4) f(\u03c4) = |\u03c4 |4 \u2212 8\u211c(\u03c43) + 18|\u03c4 |2 \u2212 27.\nIn Theorem 6.2.4 (2) of [6], Goldman proves that the matrix A \u2208 SU(2, 1) is loxodromic if and only\nif f\n(\ntr(A)\n)\n> 0. Therefore we define the region T of C by\n(4.5) T =\n{\n\u03c4 \u2208 C : f(\u03c4) > 0\n}\n.\nThis region is the exterior of a closed curve in C called a deltoid. We can now prove\nLemma 4.1. The function \u03c4(\u03bb) = e\u03bb + e\u03bb\u2212\u03bb + e\u2212\u03bb is a real analytic diffeomorphism from S onto\nT .\nProof. Writing \u03bb = l + i\u03b8, we calculate the Jacobian of \u03c4(\u03bb):\n|J\u03c4 (\u03bb)| =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202\u03c4\u2202\u03bb\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 \u2212\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202\u03c4\u2202\u03bb\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232\n=\n\u2223\u2223\u2223e\u03bb \u2212 e\u03bb\u2212\u03bb\u2223\u2223\u22232 \u2212 \u2223\u2223\u2223e\u03bb\u2212\u03bb \u2212 e\u2212\u03bb\u2223\u2223\u22232\n= 2 sinh(2l)\u2212 4 sinh(l) cos(3\u03b8)\n= 4 sinh(l)\n(\ncosh(l)\u2212 cos(3\u03b8)\n)\n,\nwhich is clearly different from 0 whenever l 6= 0. Hence \u03c4 is a local diffeomorphism on S.\nWe now show that \u03c4 is injective on S. Suppose that \u03bb = l + i\u03b8 and \u03bb\u2032 = l\u2032 + i\u03b8\u2032 are two points\nof S with \u03c4(\u03bb) = \u03c4(\u03bb\u2032). By equating real and imaginary parts we have\n2 cosh(l) cos(\u03b8) + cos(2\u03b8) = 2 cosh(l\u2032) cos(\u03b8\u2032) + cos(2\u03b8\u2032),\n2 cosh(l) sin(\u03b8)\u2212 sin(2\u03b8) = 2 cosh(l\u2032) sin(\u03b8\u2032)\u2212 sin(2\u03b8\u2032).\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 10\nEliminating l\u2032 and using the addition rule for sin(\u03b1+ \u03b2) gives\n2 cosh(l) sin(\u03b8\u2032 \u2212 \u03b8) = sin(3\u03b8\u2032)\u2212 sin(2\u03b8 + \u03b8\u2032) = 2 cos(2\u03b8\u2032 + \u03b8) sin(\u03b8\u2032 \u2212 \u03b8).\nSince cosh(l) > 1 \u2265 cos(2\u03b8\u2032 + \u03b8) we see that sin(\u03b8\u2032 \u2212 \u03b8) = 0. Hence \u03b8\u2032 = \u03b8 + k\u03c0. Plugging this into\nthe expression for \u03c4 we see that\n2 cosh(l)ei\u03b8 + e\u22122i\u03b8 = (\u22121)k2 cosh(l\u2032)ei\u03b8 + e\u22122i\u03b8.\nCancelling e\u22122i\u03b8 from each side and comparing signs, we see that k is even and so ei\u03b8 = ei\u03b8\n\u2032\n. Hence\nwe also have cosh(l) = cosh(l\u2032). Since \u03bb and \u03bb\u2032 both lie in S we see that \u03bb = \u03bb\u2032 as required. Hence\n\u03c4 is an injective, local diffeomorphism and so is a global diffeomorphism onto its image.\nWe now show that the image of S under \u03c4 is T . If f(\u03c4) is Goldman\u2019s function given by (4.4), a\nbrief calculation shows that\nf(e\u03bb + e\u03bb\u2212\u03bb + e\u2212\u03bb) = 16 sinh2(l)\n(\ncosh(l)\u2212 cos(3\u03b8)\n)2\n= |J\u03c4 (\u03bb)|\n2 > 0\nand so \u03c4(S) \u2282 T . Conversely, if \u03c4 \u2208 T then \u03c4 is the trace of a loxodromic map by Goldman\u2019s\ntheorem and we may take e\u03bb to be its eigenvalue of largest modulus. By construction \u03bb \u2208 S and\nso T \u2282 \u03c4(S). \u0003\nEven though it is not holomorphic, the function \u03c4(\u03bb) does enjoy a stronger property than merely\nbeing real analytic. Namely, in Proposition 4.2 we show that \u03c4(\u03bb) it is quasiconformal, and hence\nthis is also true of its inverse \u03bb(\u03c4). This result and its proof are very short and are are only\nincluded for interest. We will not use them in the rest of the paper. Further information about\nquasiconformality may be found in Lehto and Virtanen [13]. For any \u01eb > 0 define S\u01eb by\n(4.6) S\u01eb =\n{\n\u03bb \u2208 S : \u211c(\u03bb) \u2265 \u01eb\n}\n.\nProposition 4.2.

Following their notation, we suppose that z1, z2, z3, z4 are\nfour distinct points of \u2202H2\nC\n. Let z1, z2, z3 and z2 be corresponding lifts in V0 \u2282 C\n2,1. Their\ncomplex cross-ratio is defined to be\nX = [z1, z2, z3, z4] =\n\u3008z3, z1\u3009\u3008z4, z2\u3009\n\u3008z4, z1\u3009\u3008z3, z2\u3009\n.\nSince the zi are distinct we see that X is finite and non-zero. We note that X is invariant under\nSU(2, 1) and independent of the chosen lifts. More properties of the complex cross-ratio may be\nfound in Section 7.2 of [6]. We highlight the following properties, which are Theorem 7.2.1 and\nProperty 7 on page 226 of [6].\nProposition 5.1. Let X = [z1, z2, z3, z4] be the complex cross-ratio of the distinct points z1, z2, z3,\nz4 \u2208 \u2202H\n2\nC\n. Then\n(i) X < 0 if and only if all zi lie on a complex line and z1, z2 separate z3, z4;\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 11\n(ii) X > 0 if and only if z3, z4 lie in the same orbit of the stabiliser of z1, z2;\n(iii) X > 0 if and only if there is an antiholomorphic involution swapping z1, z2 and swapping\nz3, z4.\nWe remark that Proposition 5.1 (iii) corrects a mistake in Theorem 7.2.1 of [6] (this error was\npointed out to us by Pierre Will). We now give a proof.\nProof. [Proposition 5.1 (iii)] Suppose that such an antiholomorphic involution \u03b9 exists. Then, using\nProperties 2 and 5 on page 225 of [6] we have:\n[z1, z2, z2, z4] =\n[\n\u03b9(z1), \u03b9(z2), \u03b9(z3), \u03b9(z4)\n]\n= [z2, z1, z4, z3]\n= [z1, z2, z3, z4].\nHence [z1, z2, z3, z4] is real. (It is non-zero since the zj are distinct.)\nSuppose that [z1, z2, z3, z4] < 0. Then, using Proposition 5.1 (i), all the points zi lie on a\ncomplex line L and z1, z2 separate z3, z4. Another way of saying this is that the geodesics \u03b312\nand \u03b334 with endpoints z1, z2 and z3, z4 respectively intersect in a point z of L. There is a\nholomorphic isometry Iz in SU(2, 1) fixing z and interchanging z1, z2 and z3, z4. Therefore Iz\u03b9 is\nan antiholomorphic isometry fixing z1, z2, z3 and z4. Thus these points lie on a Lagrangian plane.\nThis is a contradiction, since four distinct boundary points cannot lie on both a complex line and\na Lagrangian plane. Hence if \u03b9 exists then [z1, z2, z3, z4] is real and positive.\nConversely, suppose that [z1, z2, z3, z4] is real and positive. Using Proposition 5.1 (ii) we see that\nthere exists A \u2208 SU(2, 1) so that A(z1) = z1, A(z2) = z2 and A(z3) = z4. Using the construction\nof Falbel and Zocca [4], there is a decomposition A = \u03b91\u03b92 as a product of two antiholomorphic\ninvolutions \u03b91 and \u03b92, each of which interchanges z1 and z2. Moreover, we are free to choose \u03b92\namong all involutions interchanging z1 and z2 and this determines \u03b91. We choose \u03b92 to be the\ninvolution fixing z3, that is \u03b92(z1) = z2 and \u03b92(z3) = z3. Using A = \u03b91\u03b92 gives \u03b91(z3) = \u03b91\u03b92(z3) = z4.\nHence \u03b91 interchanges z3 and z4. Since it also interchanges z1 and z2, it is the involution we require.\nAlternatively, one can follow Goldman\u2019s proof after observing that [z1, z2, z3, z4] = \u03a0(z3)\/\u03a0(z4)\nmust be positive if \u03a0(z3) and \u03a0(z4) lie on a hypercycle. \u0003\n5.2. The cross-ratio variety. By choosing different orderings of our four points we may define\nother cross-ratios. There are some symmetries associated to certain permutations, see Property 5\non page 225 of [6]. After taking these into account, there are only three cross-ratios that remain.\nGiven distinct points z1, . . . , z4 \u2208 \u2202H\n2\nC\n, we define\n(5.1) X1 = [z1, z2, z3, z4], X2 = [z1, z3, z2, z4], X3 = [z2, z3, z1, z4].\nIn [2] Falbel has given a general setting for cross-ratios that includes both Kora\u00b4nyi-Reimann cross-\nratios and the standard real hyperbolic cross-ratio. We use a different normalisation to his. Our\nthree cross-ratios satisfy two real equations, which we now derive. In Falbel\u2019s normalisation, the\nanalogous relations are given in Proposition 2.3 of [2]. In his general setting there are six cross-\nratios that lie on a complex algebraic variety in C6. Our cross-ratios correspond to the fixed locus\nof an antiholomorphic involution on this variety.\nProposition 5.2. Let z1, z2, z3, z4 be any four distinct points in \u2202H\n2\nC\n. Let X1, X2 and X3 be\ndefined by (5.1). Then\n|X2| = |X1| |X3|,(5.2)\n2|X1|\n2\u211c(X3) = |X1|\n2 + |X2|\n2 + 1\u2212 2\u211c(X1 + X2).(5.3)\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 12\nProof. Since SU(2, 1) acts 2-transitively on \u2202H2\nC\nwe may suppose that z2 =\u221e and z3 = o. Let z1\nand z4 be lifts of z1 and z4 chosen so that \u3008z1, z4\u3009 = 1. We write them in coordinates as:\n(5.4) z1 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\u03be1\u03b71\n\u03b61\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb , z2 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f010\n0\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb , z3 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f000\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb , z4 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\u03be4\u03b74\n\u03b64\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb .\nThen we have\n0 = \u3008z1, z1\u3009 = \u03be1\u03b61 + \u03b61\u03be1 + |\u03b71|\n2,(5.5)\n1 = \u3008z4, z1\u3009 = \u03be4\u03b61 + \u03b64\u03be1 + \u03b74\u03b71,(5.6)\n0 = \u3008z4, z4\u3009 = \u03be4\u03b64 + \u03b64\u03be4 + |\u03b74|\n2.(5.7)\nFrom the definitions of the cross-ratios, we have\nX1 = [z1, z2, z3, z4] =\n\u3008z3, z1\u3009\u3008z4, z2\u3009\n\u3008z4, z1\u3009\u3008z3, z2\u3009\n= \u03b64\u03be1,\nX2 = [z1, z3, z2, z4] =\n\u3008z2, z1\u3009\u3008z4, z3\u3009\n\u3008z4, z1\u3009\u3008z2, z3\u3009\n= \u03be4\u03b61,\nX3 = [z2, z3, z1, z4] =\n\u3008z1, z2\u3009\u3008z4, z3\u3009\n\u3008z4, z2\u3009\u3008z1, z3\u3009\n=\n\u03be4\u03b61\n\u03b64\u03be1\n.\nWe immediately see that |X3| = |X2|\/|X1|. Using equations (5.5), (5.6) and (5.7) we have:\n|X1|\n2|X3 \u2212 1|\n2 = |\u03b64\u03be1 \u2212 \u03be4\u03b61|\n2\n= |\u03b64\u03be1|\n2 + |\u03be4\u03b61|\n2 + \u03b64\u03be4\n(\n\u03b61\u03be1 + |\u03b71|\n2\n)\n+ \u03be4\u03b64\n(\n\u03be1\u03b61 + |\u03b71|\n2\n)\n= |\u03b64\u03be1 + \u03be4\u03b61|\n2 \u2212 |\u03b71\u03b74|\n2\n= |X1 +X2|\n2 \u2212 |1\u2212 X1 \u2212 X2|\n2.\nRearranging this gives the identity we want. \u0003\nSince \u2212|X3| \u2264 \u211c(X3) \u2264 |X3| an immediate consequence of the identities (5.2) and (5.3) is:\nCorollary 5.3. Let X1 and X2 be defined by (5.1). Then(\n|X1| \u2212 |X2|\n)2\n\u2264 2\u211c(X1 + X2)\u2212 1 \u2264\n(\n|X1|+ |X2|\n)2\n.\nIn particular, 2\u211c(X1 + X2) \u2265 1.\nCorollary 5.4. Let X1, X2 and X3 be defined by (5.1). Then X1 + X2 = 1 if and only if either\nX3 = \u2212X2\/X1 or X3 = \u2212X2\/X1.\nProof. We can rearrange (5.3) as:\n2|X1|\n2\u211c(X3 + X2\/X1) = |X1 + X2 \u2212 1|\n2.\nTherefore X1 + X2 = 1 if and only if \u211c(X3) = \u211c(\u2212X2\/X1). Since |X3| = |X2|\/|X1| this is true if\nand only if X3 = \u2212X2\/X1 or X3 = \u2212X2\/X1. \u0003\nWe now show that any three complex numbers satisfying the identities of Proposition 5.2 are the\ncross-ratios of four points. Again, this follows Falbel, Proposition 2.6 of [2].\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 13\nProposition 5.5. Let x1, x2 and x3 be three complex numbers satisfying\n|x2| = |x1| |x3| and 2|x1|\n2\u211c(x3) = |x1|\n2 + |x2|\n2 + 1\u2212 2\u211c(x1 + x2).\nThen there exist points z1, z2, z3, z4 in \u2202H\n2\nC\nso that\nX1 = [z1, z2, z3, z4] = x1, X2 = [z1, z3, z2, z4] = x2, X3 = [z2, z3, z1, z4] = x3.\nProof. Suppose that z2 = \u221e and z3 = o. Then, making a consistent choice of square roots of x1,\nx2, x3 and 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2, define z1 and z4 by:\nz1 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0 \u2212x\n1\/2\n1(\n2\u211c(x\n1\/2\n1 x\n1\/2\n2 e\ni\u03b4)\n)1\/2\ne\u2212i\u03b7\nx\n1\/2\n2 e\ni\u03b4\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb , z2 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f010\n0\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb , z3 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f000\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb , z4 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0 x\n1\/2\n2 e\ni\u03b4(\n2\u211c(x\n1\/2\n1 x\n1\/2\n2 e\n\u2212i\u03b4)\n)1\/2\nei\u03b7\n\u2212x\n1\/2\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\nwhere 2\u03b4 is the argument of x3 and 2\u03b7 is the argument of 1\u2212x1\u2212x2 provided 1 6= x1+x2. Arguing\nas in Corollary 5.4, if x1 + x2 = 1 then either x3 = \u2212x2\/x1 or x3 = \u2212x2\/x1. This implies that\n\u211c(x\n1\/2\n1 x\n1\/2\n2 e\ni\u03b4) = 0 or \u211c(x\n1\/2\n1 x\n1\/2\n2 e\n\u2212i\u03b4) = 0 respectively. Hence when x1 + x2 = 1 the middle entry\nof either z1 or z4 (or both) is zero, and so we are free to choose \u03b7 to be any angle.\nOne may easily check that \u3008zj , zj\u3009 = 0 for j = 1, 2, 3, 4 and also\n\u3008z3, z2\u3009 = 1, \u3008z3, z1\u3009 = \u3008z4, z2\u3009 = \u2212x\n1\/2\n1 , \u3008z2, z1\u3009 = x\n1\/2\n2 e\n\u2212i\u03b4, \u3008z4, z3\u3009 = x\n1\/2\n2 e\ni\u03b4.\nAlso, since |x1| |x2| cos(2\u03b4) = |x1|\n2\u211c(x3), we have:\n2\u211c(x\n1\/2\n1 x\n1\/2\n2 e\ni\u03b4)2\u211c(x\n1\/2\n1 x\n1\/2\n2 e\n\u2212i\u03b4) = x1x2 + 2|x1| |x2| cos(2\u03b4) + x2x1\n= x1x2 + |x1|\n2 + |x2|\n2 + 1\u2212 2\u211c(x1 + x2) + x2x1\n= |1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2|\n2.\nTherefore\n\u3008z4, z1\u3009 = x2 +\n(\n2\u211c(x\n1\/2\n1 x\n1\/2\n2 e\ni\u03b4)2\u211c(x\n1\/2\n1 x\n1\/2\n2 e\n\u2212i\u03b4)\n)1\/2\ne2i\u03b7 + x1\n= x2 + |1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2|e\n2i\u03b7 + x1 = 1,\nwhere we have used |1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2|e\n2i\u03b7 = 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2. Thus\n[z1, z2, z3, z4] =\n\u3008z3, z1\u3009\u3008z4, z2\u3009\n\u3008z4, z1\u3009\u3008z3, z2\u3009\n= x1,\n[z1, z3, z2, z4] =\n\u3008z2, z1\u3009\u3008z4, z3\u3009\n\u3008z4, z1\u3009\u3008z2, z3\u3009\n= x2\n[z2, z3, z1, z4] =\n\u3008z1, z2\u3009\u3008z4, z3\u3009\n\u3008z4, z2\u3009\u3008z1, z3\u3009\n=\n|x2|e\n2i\u03b4\n|x1|\n= x3.\n\u0003\nTherefore any triple of complex numbers (x1, x2, x3) is the triple of cross-ratios (X1,X2,X3) of\nan ordered quadruple of points z1, z2, z3, z4 in \u2202H\n2\nC\nif and only if they satisfy the two real identities\nfrom Proposition 5.5. In other words, (X1,X2,X3) lie in a four dimensional real algebraic variety in\nC\n3. We call this variety the cross-ratio variety and we denote it by X. From Falbel\u2019s point of view,\nthis variety is the moduli space of CR tetrahedra [2] and he has used it to model the figure eight\nknot complement [3]. From our point of view it is the moduli space of ordered pairs of oriented\ngeodesics, that is the axes of A and B.\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 14\nNotice that we may express |X3| and \u211c(X3) as real analytic functions of X1 and X2. Therefore we\nmay determine \u2111(X3) from X1 and X2 up to an ambiguity of sign. Thus there is an involution on\nX obtained by sending (X1,X2,X3) to (X1,X2,X3). This involution is not given by a permutation\nof the points (see [25] for all the maps given by permutations) and its geometric action on the\ncollection of quadruples of four points seems to be very mysterious. Away from the fixed point\nset of this involution, that is the locus where X3 is real, the complex numbers X1, X2 give local\ncomplex coordinates on X.\nSimilarly, we may use the identities from Proposition 5.5 to write |X2| and \u211c(X2) as real analytic\nfunctions of X1 and X3. There is again a sign ambiguity when solving for \u2111(X2) and so the complex\nnumbers X1 and X3 give local coordinates away from the locus where X2 is real. Finally, a similar\nargument shows that the complex numbers X2 and X3 give local coordinates away from the locus\nwhere X1 is real. In Section 5.4 we show that all three of X1, X2 and X3 are real if and only if the\nfour points either lie in the same complex line or on the same Lagrangian plane. Hence X has local\ncomplex coordinates away from this set.\n5.3. Cartan\u2019s angular invariant. Let z1, z2, z3 be three distinct points of \u2202H\n2\nC\nwith lifts z1, z2\nand z3. Cartan\u2019s angular invariant [1] is defined as follows:\nA (z1, z2, z3) = arg\n(\n\u2212\u3008z1, z2\u3009\u3008z2, z3\u3009\u3008z3, z1\u3009\n)\n.\nThe angular invariant is independent of the chosen lifts zj of the points zj . It is clear that applying\nan element of SU(2, 1) to our triple of points does not change the Cartan invariant. The converse\nis also true; the following result is Theorem 7.1.1 of [6]:\nProposition 5.6. Let z1, z2, z3 and z\n\u2032\n1, z\n\u2032\n2, z\n\u2032\n3 be triples of distinct points of \u2202H\n2\nC\n. Then\nA(z1, z2, z3) = A(z\n\u2032\n1, z\n\u2032\n2, z\n\u2032\n3) if and only if there exists an A \u2208 SU(2, 1) so that A(zj) = z\n\u2032\nj for\nj = 1, 2, 3. Moreover, A is unique unless the three points lie on a complex line.\nThe properties of A may be found in Section 7.1 of [6]. We shall make use of the following, which\nare Corollary 7.1.3 and Theorem 7.1.4 on pages 213-4.\nProposition 5.7.

Let z1, . . . , z4 be distinct points of \u2202H\n2\nC\nand let X1, X2, X3 denote the cross-\nratios defined by (5.1). Let A1 = A(z4, z3, z2) and A2 = (z3, z2, z1). Then\nA1 + A2 = arg(X1X2),(5.8)\nA1 \u2212 A2 = arg(X3).(5.9)\nProof.

Likewise\nX3 =\n\u3008z1, z2\u3009\u3008z4, z3\u3009\n\u3008z4, z2\u3009\u3008z1, z3\u3009\n=\n\u3008z4, z3\u3009\u3008z3, z2\u3009\u3008z2, z4\u3009\n\u2223\u2223\u3008z1, z2\u3009\u2223\u22232\n\u3008z3, z2\u3009\u3008z2, z1\u3009\u3008z1, z3\u3009\n\u2223\u2223\u3008z2, z4\u3009\u2223\u22232 ,\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 15\nwhich has argument A1 \u2212 A2. \u0003\nThe following result, which should be compare to Corollary 5.4, follows immediately:\nCorollary 5.9. Let Xi be given by (5.1). Then X3 = \u2212X2\/X1 if and only if z1, z2 and z3 lie on\nthe same complex line. Similarly, X3 = \u2212X2\/X1 if and only if z2, z3 and z4 lie on a complex line.\nProof. First, X3 = \u2212X2\/X1 if and only if arg(X3) = arg(X1X2) \u00b1 \u03c0. From (5.8) and (5.9) this is\ntrue if and only if A2 = \u00b1\u03c0\/2. The result follows from Proposition 5.7 (ii). A similar argument\nshows X3 = \u2212X2\/X1 if and only if A1 = \u00b1\u03c0\/2. \u0003\nWe can use Proposition 5.8 to prove the following crucial result; see also [2].\nProposition 5.10. Let z1, . . . , z4 be distinct points of \u2202H\n2\nC\nwith cross ratios X1, X2, X3 given\nby (5.1). Let z\u20321, . . . , z\n\u2032\n4 be another set be distinct points of \u2202H\n2\nC\nwith corresponding cross-ratios\nX\n\u2032\n1, X\n\u2032\n2 and X\n\u2032\n3. If X\n\u2032\ni = Xi for i = 1, 2, 3 then there exists A \u2208 SU(2, 1) so that A(zj) = z\n\u2032\nj for\nj = 1, 2, 3, 4.\nProof. As in the proof of Proposition 5.2, applying elements of SU(2, 1) if necessary, we suppose\nthat z2 = z\n\u2032\n2 =\u221e and z3 = z\n\u2032\n3 = o. We write lifts of the other points as\nz1 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\u03be1\u03b71\n\u03b61\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb , z4 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\u03be4\u03b74\n\u03b64\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb , z\u20321 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\u03be\u20321\u03b7\u20321\n\u03b6 \u20321\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb , z\u20324 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\u03be\u20324\u03b7\u20324\n\u03b6 \u20324\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb .\nWe may suppose that the lifts of these points are chosen so that both 1 = \u3008z4, z1\u3009 = \u03b64\u03be1+\u03b74\u03b71+\u03be4\u03b61\nand 1 = \u3008z\u20324, z\n\u2032\n1\u3009 = \u03b6\n\u2032\n4\u03be\n\u2032\n1 + \u03b7\n\u2032\n4\u03b7\n\u2032\n1 + \u03be\n\u2032\n4\u03b6\n\u2032\n1. Then our condition on the cross-ratios is\n\u03b64\u03be1 = \u03b6\n\u2032\n4\u03be\n\u2032\n1, \u03be4\u03b61 = \u03be\n\u2032\n4\u03b6\n\u2032\n1,\n\u03b61\u03be4\n\u03b64\u03be1\n=\n\u03b6 \u20321\u03be\n\u2032\n4\n\u03b6 \u20324\u03be\n\u2032\n1\n.\nHence we also have \u03b74\u03b71 = \u03b7\n\u2032\n4\u03b7\n\u2032\n1.\nAs above, denote the angular invariants of the points by A1 = A(z4, z3, z2), A2 = (z3, z2, z1),\nA\n\u2032\n1 = A(z\n\u2032\n4, z\n\u2032\n3, z\n\u2032\n2) and A\n\u2032\n2 = (z\n\u2032\n3, z\n\u2032\n2, z\n\u2032\n1). Using Proposition 5.8 we see that A1 + A2 = A\n\u2032\n1 + A\n\u2032\n2 and\nA1 \u2212 A2 = A\n\u2032\n1 \u2212 A\n\u2032\n2. Hence A1 = A\n\u2032\n1 and A2 = A\n\u2032\n2. From Proposition 5.6 we see that there exists\nA \u2208 SU(2, 1) sending z3, z2, z1 to z\n\u2032\n3 = z3, z\n\u2032\n2 = z2, z\n\u2032\n1 respectively.\nWe now show that A sends z4 to z\n\u2032\n4, which will prove the result. Because A fixes z2 = \u221e and\nz3 = 0 it must be diagonal and so, from (4.2), has the form E(\u03b1) given in (4.2) for some \u03b1 \u2208 C\nwith \u2212\u03c0 < \u2111(\u03b1) \u2264 \u03c0. Hence (multiplying z\u20321 by a unit modulus complex number if necessary) we\nhave \u03be\u20321 = e\n\u03b1\u03be1, \u03b7\n\u2032\n1 = e\n\u03b1\u2212\u03b1\u03b71 and \u03b6\n\u2032\n1 = e\n\u2212\u03b1\u03b61. Therefore\n\u03be\u20324 =\n\u03be\u20324\u03b6\n\u2032\n1\n\u03b6\n\u2032\n1\n=\n\u03be4\u03b61\ne\u2212\u03b1\u03b61\n= e\u03b1\u03be4, \u03b7\n\u2032\n4 =\n\u03b7\u20324\u03b7\n\u2032\n1\n\u03b7\u20321\n=\n\u03b74\u03b71\ne\u03b1\u2212\u03b1\u03b71\n= e\u03b1\u2212\u03b1\u03b74, \u03b6\n\u2032\n4 =\n\u03b6 \u20324\u03be\n\u2032\n1\n\u03be\n\u2032\n1\n=\n\u03b64\u03be1\ne\u03b1\u03be1\n= e\u2212\u03b1\u03b64.\nHence A = E(\u03b1) also sends z4 to z\n\u2032\n4. \u0003\nWe remark that this result is false if we only know that two of the cross-ratios the same. Suppose\nwe have two quadruples of points z1, . . . , z4 and z\n\u2032\n1, . . . , z\n\u2032\n4 with cross ratios Xi and X\n\u2032\ni respectively\nfor i = 1, 2, 3. If we only know that X1 = X\n\u2032\n1 and X2 = X\n\u2032\n2 then either X3 = X\n\u2032\n3 or X3 = X\n\u2032\n3. In the\nlatter case we have A1 = A\n\u2032\n2 and A2 = A\n\u2032\n1, where the angular invariants A1, A2, A\n\u2032\n1 and A\n\u2032\n2 are as\ndefined in the proof above. When X3 is not real we know that A1 6= A2 from (5.9). Thus A1 6= A\n\u2032\n1\nand therefore there is no element of SU(2, 1) sending zj to z\n\u2032\nj for j = 2, 3, 4.\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 16\nComposing the above result with complex conjugation gives\nCorollary 5.11. Let z1, . . . , z4 be distinct points of \u2202H\n2\nC\nwith cross ratios X1, X2, X3 given by\n(5.1). Let z\u20321, . . . , z\n\u2032\n4 be another set be distinct points of \u2202H\n2\nC\nwith corresponding cross-ratios X\u20321,\nX\n\u2032\n2 and X\n\u2032\n3. If X\n\u2032\ni = Xi for i = 1, 2, 3 then there exists an anti-holomorphic complex hyperbolic\nisometry \u03b9 so that \u03b9(zj) = z\n\u2032\nj for j = 1, 2, 3, 4.\n5.4. When all the cross-ratios are real. In this section we consider the special case where all\nthree cross-ratios are real. Putting this into equation (5.2) implies that X3 = \u00b1X2\/X1. We show\nthat these two cases correspond to our four points either lying in a complex line or a Lagrangian\nplane; compare [25]. Moreover, there are six components to the locus where all three cross-ratios\nare real: three each for the cases where the points lie on complex line or a Lagrangian plane. The\nthree cases are determined by the relative separation properties of the points.\nProposition 5.12. Suppose that X1, X2 and X3 are all real.\n(i) If X3 = \u2212X2\/X1 then the points zj all lie on a complex line.\n(ii) If X3 = X2\/X1 then the points zj all lie on a Lagrangian plane.\nProof. If X3 = \u2212X2\/X1 then at least one of them is negative and the result follows from Proposition\n5.1 (i).\nIf X3 = X2\/X1 then either all three of them are positive or two of them are negative. In the\nlatter case the separation conditions of Proposition 5.1 (i) lead to a contradiction. Thus they are\nall positive. From Proposition 5.1 (iii) there are antiholomorphic involutions \u03b91, \u03b92 and \u03b93 so that\n\u03b91(z1) = z2, \u03b91(z3) = z4; \u03b92(z1) = z3, \u03b92(z2) = z4; \u03b93(z2) = z3, \u03b93(z1) = z4.\nOne immediately checks that \u03b93\u03b92\u03b91 fixes each of z1, z2, z3, z4. Therefore the four points are all\nfixed by the same antiholomorphic isometry, and so must be in the same Lagrangian plane; see\nLemma 7.1.6 (i) of [6]. \u0003\nWe now prove the converse to Proposition 5.12. We begin with the case where the points lie on\na complex line.\nProposition 5.13. Suppose that z1, z2, z3 and z4 all lie on the same complex line. Then X1, X2\nand X3 are each real and satisfy X3 = \u2212X2\/X1.\nProof. From Corollary 5.9 we see that both X3 = \u2212X2\/X1 and X3 = \u2212X2\/X1. Thus X3 is real.\nUsing Corollary 5.4 we also have X1 +X2 = 1. Since the ratio and sum of X1 and X2 are both real\nthen they must also be real. This proves the result. \u0003\nProposition 5.14. Suppose that all of the fixed points of A and B are contained in same Lagrangian\nplane. Then X1, X2, X3 are each real, positive and satisfy X3 = X2\/X1.\nProof. Let \u03b9 be the antiholomorphic involution fixing the Lagrangian plane. Then applying \u03b9 to the\npoints zj we see that Xi = Xi, for i = 1, 2, 3. Hence all the cross-ratios are real. Using Proposition\n5.7 (iii) we have A1 = A2 = 0. Thus from Proposition 5.8, we have arg(X3) = arg(X1X2) = 0.\nHence X3 and X2\/X1 are both real and positive and hence are equal. Finally, putting this into (5.3)\nand rearranging gives\n2X1 + 2X2 = 1 + (X1 \u2212 X2)\n2 > 0.\nSince X2\/X1 > 0 this implies X1 and X2 are both positive. \u0003\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 17\n4\n4\n3\n2\n3\n1\n\u22122\n1\n2\n0\n\u22121\n\u22123\n0\u22121\u22122\u22123\nFigure 5.1.

Moreover, using Corollary 5.4, we have X1+X2 = 1 and so that all three of them\ncannot be negative. Thus two of the Xi are positive and the third is negative. Furthermore, by\nusing Proposition 5.1 (i), the one that is negative is determined by the separation properties of the\npoints zj . This gives three components to the cross-ratio variety associated to quadruples of points\non a complex line. In Figure 5.1 we draw this locus in the (X1,X2) plane. The three components\nare obtained from the line X1 + X2 = 1 by removing the points (1, 0) and (0, 1).\nSimilarly, if the points lie on a Lagrangian plane then the Xi are each real, positive and satisfy\nX3 = X2\/X1. In this case, we can rearrange (5.3) to give\n0 = X21 + X\n2\n2 + 1\u2212 2X1 \u2212 2X2 \u2212 2X1X2\n=\n(\nX\n1\/2\n1 + X\n1\/2\n2 + 1\n)(\nX\n1\/2\n1 + X\n1\/2\n2 \u2212 1\n)(\nX\n1\/2\n1 \u2212 X\n1\/2\n2 + 1\n)(\nX\n1\/2\n1 \u2212 X\n1\/2\n2 \u2212 1\n)\nfor some consistent choice of square roots of the positive numbers X1 and X2. By making a suitable\nnormalisation, it is not hard to show which of these brackets is zero from the separation properties\nof the points, and so we deduce that there are again three components:\nCorollary 5.15. Suppose that the four points zj lie on a Lagrangian plane. Then the positive\nsquare roots of X1 and X2 satisfy:\n(i) X\n1\/2\n1 + X\n1\/2\n2 = 1 if z1 and z4 separate z2 and z3;\n(ii) X\n1\/2\n1 \u2212 X\n1\/2\n2 = 1 if z1 and z3 separate z2 and z4;\n(iii) \u2212X\n1\/2\n1 + X\n1\/2\n2 = 1 if z1 and z2 separate z3 and z4.\nIn Figure 5.1 we also draw this locus in the (X1,X2) plane. The three components are obtained\nby removing the points (1, 0) and (0, 1) from the parabola X21 + X\n2\n2 + 1\u2212 2X1 \u2212 2X2 \u2212 2X1X2 = 0.\n(Compare this with Figure 2 of [10] where the same locus is plotted in the (X\n1\/2\n1 ,X\n1\/2\n2 ) plane.)\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 18\n6. Cross-ratios and pairs of loxodromic maps\n6.1. Associating cross-ratios to pairs of loxodromic transformations. Let A and B be\nloxodromic transformations with attracting fixed points aA, aB and repelling fixed points rA, rB\nrespectively. Suppose that these fixed points correspond to attractive eigenvectors aA, aB and\nrepulsive eigenvectors rA, rB respectively. For the rest of this paper we only consider the case\nwhere neither rB nor aB equals either rA or aA, that is the real axes of A and B are distinct and\ndo not share an end-point. Cross-ratios associated to pairs of loxodromic maps were used in [10]\nto generalise J\u00f8rgensen\u2019s inequality to complex hyperbolic space. Some of the properties of the\ncross-ratios we use in this section are generalisations of properties used there.\nFollowing (5.1), we define the first, second and third cross-ratios of the loxodromic maps A and\nB to be\nX1(A,B) = [aB , aA, rA, rB ] =\n\u3008rA,aB\u3009\u3008rB ,aA\u3009\n\u3008rB ,aB\u3009\u3008rA,aA\u3009\n,(6.1)\nX2(A,B) = [aB , rA, aA, rB ] =\n\u3008aA,aB\u3009\u3008rB , rA\u3009\n\u3008rB ,aB\u3009\u3008aA, rA\u3009\n,(6.2)\nX3(A,B) = [aA, rA, aB , rB ] =\n\u3008aB ,aA\u3009\u3008rB , rA\u3009\n\u3008rB ,aA\u3009\u3008aB , rA\u3009\n.(6.3)\nSince the fixed points were assumed to be distinct, none of these cross-ratios is either zero or infinity.\nThese three numbers satisfy the identities of of Proposition 5.2. Therefore they define a point on\nthe cross-ratio variety X associated to these four points. We call this the cross-ratio variety of the\npair of loxodromic maps A and B and we call it X(A,B). Using Property 5 on page 225 of [6] we\nimmediately obtain.\nProposition 6.1. The following hold:\nX1(B,A) = X1(A,B), X2(B,A) = X2(A,B), X3(B,A) = X3(A,B);\nX1(A\n\u22121, B) = X2(A,B), X2(A\n\u22121, B) = X1(A,B), X3(A\n\u22121, B) = 1\/X3(A,B);\nX1(A,B\n\u22121) = X2(A,B), X2(A,B\n\u22121) = X1(A,B), X3(A,B\n\u22121) = 1\/X3(A,B);\nX1(A\n\u22121, B\u22121) = X1(A,B), X2(A\n\u22121, B\u22121) = X2(A,B), X3(A\n\u22121, B\u22121) = X3(A,B).\nTherefore either swapping A and B or else replacing either or both of A and B with their inverse\ndefines an automorphism of X(A,B).\n6.2. Traces and cross-ratios. In this section we investigate the relationship between the cross-\nratios Xi(A,B) and traces of elements of the group \u3008A,B\u3009. We shall use this when discussing\nchange of coordinates on a three-holed sphere in Section 7.2 and also trace coordinates in Section\n7.3. In what follows we make use of the following normalisation; see [10]. Our main results are\nindependent of this normalisation, but it will be useful for calculations. We normalise so that A\nfixes o and \u221e, that is it as the form (4.2):\n(6.4) A = E(\u03bb) =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0e\n\u03bb 0 0\n0 e\u03bb\u2212\u03bb 0\n0 0 e\u2212\u03bb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\nwhere \u03bb \u2208 S.

Representations that preserve a complex line. We now consider representations that\npreserve a complex line. We show that certain traces are also forced to be real, and so the associated\ncomplex length parameter \u03bbj will be a real length parameter lj \u2208 R+.\nLemma 6.6. Let A and B be elements of SU(2, 1) that both preserve the same complex line with\nA loxodromic. Then [A,B] = ABA\u22121B\u22121 has real trace.\nProof. The imaginary part of the trace arises from the representation into the group U(1) of rota-\ntions around the complex line. This representation is necessarily abelian and so the commutator is\nrepresented by the identity.\nAlternatively, we now show the result directly. We may suppose that A and BA\u22121B\u22121 have\nthe forms (6.4) and (6.5) with \u00b5 = \u2212\u03bb. Since they preserve a complex line we know that their\ncross-ratios are real and sum to 1. Putting this information into Proposition 7.3 (with BA\u22121B\u22121\nin place of B) and simplifying, gives tr(ABA\u22121B\u22121) = 3 + 2\n(\ncosh(\u03bb+ \u03bb)\u2212 1\n)\nX2. \u0003\nLemma 6.7. Let A and B be loxodromic elements of SU(2, 1) preserving a complex line and both\nhaving real trace. Then tr(AB) is real.\nProof. This again uses Proposition 7.3 but is even easier as \u03bb, \u00b5, X1 and X2 are all real. \u0003\nThese seemingly innocent lemmas have a far reaching consequence for the traces associated curves\nin our curve system.\nProposition 6.8. Let \u03b3j be a simple curve system on \u03a3. Suppose that \u03c1 : \u03c01(\u03a3) \u2212\u2192 SU(2, 1)\npreserves a complex line. Let \u03c1(\u03b3j) = Aj for j = 1, . . . , 3g \u2212 3. Suppose that \u03b3j is in the boundary\nof distinct three-holed spheres (that is \u03b3j is not associated to a handle). Then tr(Aj) is real.\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 21\nProof. Consider the g three-holed spheres that are used to close a handle. Each of these corresponds\nto a (1, 1) group and the boundary component is a commutator [A,B]. Thus it is represented by\na loxodromic map with real trace, Lemma 6.6. If g = 2 we are done. Suppose g \u2265 3. Consider the\nremaining g \u2212 2 three-holed spheres that are not used to form a handle. These are glued together\nto form a g-holed sphere, and each of the g group elements representing a hole is a commutator.\nOf these g \u2212 2 three-holed spheres, there is at least one with two boundary loops represented by\ncommutators, and hence which have real trace. The third peripheral element of this three-holed\nsphere is the product of the inverses of the other two peripheral elements. Hence, using Lemma\n6.7, it too has real trace. Now consider the remaining g\u22123 three-holed spheres. These are attached\ntogether to form a (g \u2212 1)-holed sphere, where all g \u2212 1 holes are represented by group elements\nwith real trace. Thus we may repeat the above argument and, by induction, we see that in each of\nthe g \u2212 2 three-holed spheres that is not used to form a handle, each peripheral element has real\ntrace. This proves the result. \u0003\n7. Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates of three-holed spheres\n7.1. Parameters associated to a three-holed sphere. The first step in defining Fenchel-Nielsen\ncoordinates is to parametrise complex hyperbolic groups representing three-holed spheres. In the\nclassical case, one parametrises each three-holed sphere by the three lengths lj of the geodesic\nboundary curves \u03b3j . From the group theory perspective, a three-holed sphere corresponds to a\nsubgroup generated by two loxodromic transformations A and B in SL(2,R) whose product is also\nloxodromic. (One needs to restrict to the case where the axes of A, B and AB are disjoint and do\nnot separate each other.) Such a group is called a (0, 3) group, that is it corresponds to a surface\nof genus 0 with 3 boundary components. The three boundary curves \u03b31, \u03b32 and \u03b33 are represented\nby A, B and B\u22121A\u22121 which are called the peripheral elements of \u3008A,B\u3009. Actually, the boundary\ncomponents correspond to the conjugacy classes of A, B and B\u22121A\u22121. Going once around each\nboundary curve in turn gives a trivial loop and this corresponds to the relation AB(B\u22121A\u22121) = I\nand explains why we have used B\u22121A\u22121 for the third boundary curve. The three length parameters\nl1, l2 and l3 may be read off from the traces of A, B and B\n\u22121A\u22121. Plane hyperbolic geometry tells\nus that these three numbers are independent and completely determine the three-holed sphere, or\nequivalently A and B, up to conjugation.\nWe want to mimic this construction in the complex hyperbolic setting. Once again a (0, 3) group\nis a group generated by two loxodromic elements A and B whose product AB is also loxodromic.\nThe three boundary curves are again represented by (the conjugacy classes of) A, B and B\u22121A\u22121.\nWe choose to focus on the representation theory viewpoint and so we want to parametrise conjugacy\nclasses of groups generated by two loxodromic transformations A and B. Unfortunately, three\ncomplex numbers are not enough to parametrise such groups and so the obvious analogy with the\nclassical case breaks down. In fact one needs to use eight real parameters.\nThe parameters we use to describe (0, 3) groups \u3008A, B\u3009, and so also to parametrise the associated\nthree-holed spheres, are the traces tr(A), tr(B), which each lie in the domain T \u2282 C given by (4.5),\ntogether with a point on the cross-ratio variety X(A,B). We call these parameters the Fenchel-\nNielsen coordinates of the (0, 3) group \u3008A, B\u3009. Away from the locus where X3(A,B) is real, the\ncross-ratios X1(A,B) and X2(A,B) give local complex coordinates on X(A,B), but, as remarked\nabove, these are not global coordinates. The goal of this section is to show that these parameters\ndetermine the (0, 3) group up to conjugation. The collection of pairs of loxodromic isometries with\ndistinct fixed points have also been parametrised by Will [24] using their traces and a particular\nnormalisation of their fixed points. One may write his fixed points in terms of our cross-ratios and\nvice versa.\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 22\nThe following Theorem establishes that complex hyperbolic Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates for (0, 3)\ngroups are unique up to conjugation.\nTheorem 7.1. The (0, 3) group \u3008A, B\u3009 is determined up to conjugation in SU(2, 1) by its Fenchel-\nNielsen coordinates: tr(A), tr(B) and a point on X(A,B).\nProof. Suppose that A, B, A\u2032 and B\u2032 are loxodromic transformations for which tr(A) = tr(A\u2032),\ntr(B) = tr(B\u2032) and Xi(A,B) = Xi(A\n\u2032, B\u2032) for i = 1, 2, 3. Since the cross-ratios are equal,\nProposition 5.10 implies that there exists a C \u2208 SU(2, 1) so that aA\u2032 = C(aA), rA\u2032 = C(rA),\naB\u2032 = C(aB) and rB\u2032 = C(rB). Therefore A\n\u2032 and CAC\u22121 have the same fixed points. Since they\nalso have the same trace, we must have A\u2032 = CAC\u22121. Similarly, B\u2032 and CBC\u22121 are equal as they\nhave the same fixed points and the same trace. Thus \u3008A\u2032, B\u2032\u3009 = \u3008CAC\u22121, CBC\u22121\u3009 = C\u3008A,B\u3009C\u22121\nas claimed. \u0003\n7.2. Change of coordinates on the same three-holed sphere. There is a natural three-fold\nsymmetry associated to a three-holed sphere which is respected by the classical Fenchel-Nielsen\ncoordinates, both for Teichmu\u00a8ller space and for quasi-Fuchsian space. It is glaringly obvious that\nour parameters fail to respect this symmetry. Namely, they use the group elements corresponding\nto two of the boundary components and completely ignore the third. This is not an ideal situation.\nIn this section we partially rectify this problem by showing that passing from the Fenchel-Nielsen\ncoordinates determined by one pair of boundary components to those coordinates determined by\nanother pair is a real analytic change of variables. Let \u3008A, B\u3009 be a (0, 3) group with peripheral\ncurves represented by A, B and B\u22121A\u22121. Our goal will be to show that the Fenchel-Nielsen\ncoordinates associated to the pair A, B\u22121A\u22121 may be expressed as a real analytic function of the\nFenchel-Nielsen coordinates associated to A, B. Using this result and Proposition 6.1, we could do\nthe same for the peripheral curves B, B\u22121A\u22121. We leave the details for the reader.\nAnother way of symmetrising our Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates for a three-holed sphere would be\nto take the three traces tr(A), tr(B) and tr(B\u22121A\u22121) together with a point on each of the cross-ratio\nvarieties X(A,B), X(A,B\u22121A\u22121) and X(B,B\u22121A\u22121) subject to suitable (real analytic) relations.\nThese relations could be deduced from the results below and we will not pursue this idea.\nTheorem 7.2. Let A, B and B\u22121A\u22121 be loxodromic elements of SU(2, 1). Then tr(B\u22121A\u22121),\nX1(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121), X2(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121) and X3(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121) may be expressed as real analytic functions\nof tr(A), tr(B), X1(A,B), X2(A,B) and X3(A,B).\nLet e\u03bb and e\u00b5, for \u03bb, \u00b5 \u2208 S, be the attractive eigenvalues of the loxodromic maps A and B,\nrespectively. Then, using Lemma 4.1, we can write \u03bb and \u00b5 as a real analytic functions of tr(A) and\ntr(B) respectively. Thus, to prove Theorem 7.2 it suffices to show that tr(B\u22121A\u22121), X1(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121),\nX2(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121) and X3(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121) may be expressed as real analytic functions of \u03bb, \u00b5, X1(A,B),\nX2(A,B) and X3(A,B).\nThe following result is an immediate consequence of Proposition 6.4. Note that tr(B\u22121A\u22121) may\nbe obtained from from tr(AB) by replacing \u03bb and \u00b5 with \u2212\u03bb and \u2212\u00b5 respectively.\nProposition 7.3. Let A and B be loxodromic maps in SU(2, 1) with attracting eigenvalues e\u03bb, e\u00b5\nwhere \u03bb, \u00b5 \u2208 S and let also X1 = X1(A,B) and X2 = X2(A,B) be their first two cross-ratios. Then\ntr(B\u22121A\u22121) may be expressed as a real analytic function of \u03bb, \u00b5, X1 and X2.\nWe now show the same thing for the cross ratios Xi(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121).\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 23\nProposition 7.4. Let A and B be loxodromic maps in SU(2, 1) with attracting eigenvalues e\u03bb, e\u00b5\nwhere \u03bb, \u00b5 \u2208 S and let also X1 = X1(A,B), X2 = X2(A,B) and X3 = X3(A,B) be their cross-ratios.\nThen Xj(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121) may be expressed as a real analytic function of \u03bb, \u00b5, X1, X3 and X3.\nProof. We may conjugate so that\nA = E(\u03bb), B = QE(\u00b5)Q\u22121, B\u22121A\u22121 = RE(\u03bd)R\u22121.\nThen multiplying through, equating the upper left hand entries of B\u22121A\u22121 and those of AB and\nusing standard properties of the entries of Q and R we obtain\ne\u03bd\u2212\u03bd + X1(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121)\u03c3(\u03bd) + X2(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121)\u03c3(\u2212\u03bd) = e\u2212\u03bb\n(\ne\u00b5\u2212\u00b5 + X1 \u03c3(\u2212\u00b5) + X2 \u03c3(\u00b5)\n)\n,\ne\u03bd\u2212\u03bd + X1(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121)\u03c3(\u2212\u03bd) + X2(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121)\u03c3(\u03bd) = e\u03bb\n(\ne\u00b5\u2212\u00b5 + X1 \u03c3(\u00b5) + X2 \u03c3(\u2212\u00b5)\n)\n.\nSince \u03c3(\u03bd) = \u2212e\u03bd\u03c3(\u2212\u03bd) and |e\u03bd | 6= 1, we may eliminate either X1(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121) or X2(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121)\nfrom these equations. Thus we can write each of X1(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121) and X2(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121) as a real\nanalytic function of \u03bb, \u00b5, \u03bd, X1 and X2.\nUsing Corollary 6.5 as well as |e\u03bb| 6= 1 and |e\u03bd | 6= 1, we can write X3(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121) as a real an-\nalytic function of \u03bb, \u03bd, X1(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121), X2(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121) and tr[A,B\u22121A\u22121]. As is well known,\n[A,B\u22121A\u22121] = A(AB)\u22121A\u22121(AB) = B\u22121(BAB\u22121A\u22121)B = B\u22121[A,B]\u22121B. Hence, we have\ntr[A,B\u22121A\u22121] = tr[A,B]. Using the second part of Proposition 6.4 we can write tr[A,B] as a\nreal analytic function of \u03bb, \u00b5, X1, X2 and X3. Substituting this in the previous expression, we can\nwrite X3(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121) as a real analytic function of \u03bb, \u00b5, \u03bd, X1, X2 and X3.\nHence we can express X1(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121), X2(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121) and X3(A,B\n\u22121A\u22121) as real analytic func-\ntions of \u03bb, \u00b5, \u03bd, X1, X2 and X3. Using Proposition 7.3 we see that tr(B\n\u22121A\u22121), and hence \u03bd, may\nbe expressed as a real analytic function of \u03bb, \u00b5, X1 and X2. Substituting for \u03bd in the expressions\nabove gives the result. \u0003\nThus we have proved Theorem 7.2. In the application to surface groups we shall consider the\nfollowing situation which is not quite covered by the preceding results. We shall want to specify\nthe traces of the peripheral elements A, B and B\u22121A\u22121 and find all possible Fenchel-Nielsen\ncoordinates. We now show that we can find X1(A,B) in terms of tr(A), tr(B), tr(B\n\u22121A\u22121) and\nX2(A,B). Hence we can find\n\u2223\u2223X3(A,B)\u2223\u2223 and \u211c(X3(A,B)) and so we can determine two possible\npoints on X(A,B); or one if \u2111\n(\nX3(A,B)\n)\n= 0.\nProposition 7.5. Let A and B be loxodromic maps in SU(2, 1) with attracting eigenvalues e\u03bb, e\u00b5\nwhere \u03bb, \u00b5 \u2208 S and let also X1 = X1(A,B) and X2 = X2(A,B) be their first two cross-ratios.\nSuppose that B\u22121A\u22121 is loxodromic with attracting eigenvalue e\u03bd for \u03bd \u2208 S. Then X1 may be\nexpressed as a real analytic function of \u03bb, \u00b5, \u03bd and X2.\nProof. Since tr(B\u22121A\u22121) = e\u03bd + e\u03bd\u2212\u03bd + e\u2212\u03bd is linear in X1, X1, X2 and X2 with coefficients that\nare analytic functions of \u03bb and \u00b5, we can conjugate and eliminate X1 and so express X1 as a real\nanalytic function of \u03bb, \u00b5, \u03bd and X2. This function is well defined provided\nX1 \u03c3(\u2212\u03bb)\u03c3(\u2212\u00b5) + X1 \u03c3(\u03bb)\u03c3(\u00b5),\nviewed as a function of X1 and X1, is not a multiple of its complex conjugate. This is true provided\u2223\u2223\u03c3(\u2212\u03bb)\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u03c3(\u2212\u00b5)\u2223\u2223 6= \u2223\u2223\u03c3(\u03bb)\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u03c3(\u00b5)\u2223\u2223 = |e\u03bb| \u2223\u2223\u03c3(\u2212\u03bb)\u2223\u2223 |e\u00b5| \u2223\u2223\u03c3(\u2212\u00b5)\u2223\u2223.\nin other words, provided |e\u03bb| |e\u00b5| 6= 1. Since \u03bb and \u00b5 lie in S this condition is satisfied. This gives\nthe result. \u0003\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 24\nWe remark that the same argument enables us to express X2 as a real analytic function of \u03bb, \u00b5,\n\u03bd and X1 provided |e\n\u03bb| 6= |e\u03bd |. This is not always the case for \u03bb, \u00b5 \u2208 S. In particular, when we\nclose a handle below we will have \u00b5 = \u03bb.\n7.3. Trace coordinates. In this section we discuss the number of trace parameters that are needed\nto parametrise (0, 3) groups. We do not use this when constructing Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates,\nbut we include it for completeness. We first show that the cross-ratios X1(A,B) and X2(A,B) may\nbe expressed uniquely in terms of tr(A), tr(B), tr(AB) and tr(A\u22121B).\nProposition 7.6. Let A and B be loxodromic maps in SU(2, 1) with attracting eigenvalues e\u03bb,\ne\u00b5 where \u03bb, \u00b5 \u2208 S. Then X1 = X1(A,B) and X2 = X2(A,B) may be expressed as a real analytic\nfunction of \u03bb, \u00b5, tr(AB) and tr(A\u22121B).\nProof. By Proposition 6.4 we have\ntr(AB) = (e\u03bb + e\u2212\u03bb)e\u00b5\u2212\u00b5 + e\u03bb\u2212\u03bb(e\u00b5 + e\u2212\u00b5)\u2212 e\u03bb\u2212\u03bbe\u00b5\u2212\u00b5\n+\n(\nX1 \u03c3(\u2212\u00b5) + X2 \u03c3(\u00b5)\n)\n\u03c3(\u2212\u03bb) +\n(\nX1 \u03c3(\u00b5) +X2 \u03c3(\u2212\u00b5)\n)\n\u03c3(\u03bb).\nFrom the fact that the attractive eigenvalue of A\u22121 is e\u03bb we similarly have\ntr(A\u22121B) = (e\u2212\u03bb + e\u03bb)e\u00b5\u2212\u00b5 + e\u03bb\u2212\u03bb(e\u00b5 + e\u2212\u00b5)\u2212 e\u03bb\u2212\u03bbe\u00b5\u2212\u00b5\n+\n(\nX1 \u03c3(\u2212\u00b5) + X2 \u03c3(\u00b5)\n)\n\u03c3(\u03bb) +\n(\nX1 \u03c3(\u00b5) + X2 \u03c3(\u2212\u00b5)\n)\n\u03c3(\u2212\u03bb).\nUsing elementary linear algebra we may solve these two equations for X1 \u03c3(\u2212\u00b5) + X2 \u03c3(\u00b5) and\nX1 \u03c3(\u00b5) + X2 \u03c3(\u2212\u00b5). This uses\n\u2223\u2223\u03c3(\u03bb)\u2223\u2223= |e\u03bb| \u2223\u2223\u03c3(\u2212\u03bb)\u2223\u2223 and |e\u03bb| 6= 1. Then complex conjugating\none of the resulting equations we may solve for X1 and X2. This uses\n\u2223\u2223\u03c3(\u00b5)\u2223\u2223= |e\u00b5| \u2223\u2223\u03c3(\u2212\u00b5)\u2223\u2223 and\n|e\u00b5| 6= 1. \u0003\nWe can use the previous result to eliminate the cross-ratios and only deal with traces. However,\nas we show here this does not determine \u3008A,B\u3009 up to conjugacy in SU(2, 1). This is because the\nsign of \u2111\n(\nX3(A,B)\n)\nis not determined by the traces of A, B, AB and AB\u22121.\nProposition 7.7. Suppose that \u0393 = \u3008A, B\u3009 and \u0393\u2032 = \u3008A\u2032, B\u2032\u3009 are (0, 3) groups with tr(A) = tr(A\u2032),\ntr(B) = tr(B\u2032), tr(AB) = tr(A\u2032B\u2032) and tr(A\u22121B) = tr(A\u2032\u22121B\u2032). Then either there exists a holo-\nmorphic isometry C in SU(2, 1) so that A\u2032 = CAC\u22121 and B\u2032 = CBC\u22121 or else there is an anti-\nholomorphic isometry \u03b9 so that A\u2032 = \u03b9A\u22121\u03b9\u22121 and B\u2032 = \u03b9B\u22121\u03b9\u22121. In particular the groups \u0393 and \u0393\u2032\nare conjugate by an isometry, which may not be holomorphic.\nProof. Write Xi = Xi(A,B) and X\n\u2032\ni = Xi(A\n\u2032, B\u2032). From Proposition 7.6 we see that our hypotheses\non the traces imply that X\u20321 = X1 and X\n\u2032\n2 = X2. From equations (5.2) and (5.3) we see that either\nX\n\u2032\n3 = X3 or else X\n\u2032\n3 = X3.\nIn the former case, by Proposition 5.10, there exists a holomorphic isometry C with aA\u2032 = C(aA),\nrA\u2032 = C(rA), aB\u2032 = C(aB) and rB\u2032 = C(rB). Since A\n\u2032 and CAC\u22121 have the same traces and fixed\npoints they must be equal. Likewise, B\u2032 and CBC\u22121 are equal.\nNow consider the latter case, namely X\u20321 = X1, X\n\u2032\n2 = X2 and X\n\u2032\n3 = X3. Using Proposition 6.1 we\nhave\nX1(A\n\u2032, B\u2032) = X1(A,B) = X1(A\u22121, B\u22121),\nX2(A\n\u2032, B\u2032) = X2(A,B) = X2(A\u22121, B\u22121),\nX3(A\n\u2032, B\u2032) = X3(A,B) = X3(A\u22121, B\u22121).\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 25\nTherefore, from Corollary 5.11, there is an antiholomorphic isometry \u03b9 sending the attractive and re-\npulsive fixed points of A\u22121 and B\u22121 to those of A\u2032 and B\u2032. In other words, aA\u2032 = \u03b9(rA), rA\u2032 = \u03b9(aA),\naB\u2032 = \u03b9(rB) and rB\u2032 = \u03b9(aB). Since \u03b9 is antiholomorphic, we have\ntr(A\u2032) = tr(A) = tr(A\u22121) = tr(\u03b9A\u22121\u03b9\u22121).\nBecause the fixed points and traces of A\u2032 and \u03b9A\u22121\u03b9\u22121 are the same, they are equal. Likewise,\nB\u2032 = \u03b9B\u22121\u03b9\u22121. This proves the result. \u0003\nThere is a strong contrast between the previous result and the classical case, where these four\ntraces determine the group up to conjugacy by a holomorphic (that is orientation preserving) isom-\netry. Thus one must be very careful when using trace parameters to determine SU(2, 1) conjugacy\nclasses. However, we can conclude that five traces are sufficient. Of course, these five traces satisfy\ntwo real equations, which may be deduced from Proposition 6.4. This is in the spirit of the theorem\nof Okumura [16] and Schmutz [19].\nProposition 7.8. Let \u3008A, B\u3009 and \u3008A\u2032, B\u2032\u3009 be two (0, 3) groups. If tr(A) = tr(A\u2032), tr(B) = tr(B\u2032),\ntr(AB) = tr(A\u2032B\u2032), tr(A\u22121B) = tr(A\u2032\u22121B\u2032) and tr[A,B] = tr[A\u2032, B\u2032] then \u3008A, B\u3009 and \u3008A\u2032, B\u2032\u3009 are\nconjugate in SU(2, 1).\nProof. Using Proposition 7.6 we may show that tr(A) = tr(A\u2032), tr(B) = tr(B\u2032), tr(AB) = tr(A\u2032B\u2032)\nand tr(A\u22121B) = tr(A\u2032\u22121B\u2032) imply that both X1(A,B) = X1(A\n\u2032, B\u2032) and X2(A,B) = X2(A\n\u2032, B\u2032). If\nwe also have tr[A,B] = tr[A\u2032, B\u2032] then these facts and Corollary 6.5 imply X3(A,B) = X3(A\n\u2032, B\u2032).\nHence the groups correspond to the same point on the cross-ratio variety. In other words, they\nhave the same Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates and so, from Theorem 7.1, they are conjugate. \u0003\nThis should be compared to the discussion on page 102 of [23], where Wen shows that in SL(3,C)\none may express the traces of any element of \u3008A,B\u3009 as a polynomial in the traces of A, A\u22121, B,\nB\u22121, AB, B\u22121A\u22121, A\u22121B, B\u22121A and ABA2B2. Moreover, the last of these traces satisfies a\nquadratic polynomial whose coefficients are polynomials in the other eight. In other words there\nare two possibilities for this trace. In our setting tr(A\u22121) = tr(A) and so Wen\u2019s first eight variables\nmay be replaced with just four. Moreover, in order to determine the group up to conjugation we\njust need a choice of sign for \u2111(X3). This translates into two possible values for tr[A,B]. See also\n[25] for a more detailed discussion of this material.\n8. Twist-bend parameters\n8.1. The complex hyperbolic Fenchel-Nielsen twist-bend. Suppose that we are given two\nthree-holed spheres with the property that two of the boundary components, one on each three-holed\nsphere, are compatible (in a sense to be made precise below). We now discuss how to parametrise\nthe possible ways to attach the two three-holed spheres to form a four-holed sphere. An analogous\nsituation is that of a single three-holed sphere where two of the boundary components are compatible\nand we want to discuss how to parametrise ways to attach these boundary components to form a\none holed torus group. We will discuss the details of these two cases in separate sections below,\nbut the general principles in each case are the same.\nFirst we must explain what we meant by the word \u2018compatible\u2019 in the previous paragraph. To be\nprecise suppose that \u3008A,B\u3009 and \u3008C,D\u3009 are two (0, 3) groups (which may be conjugate). We say that\nthe boundary components associated to A and D are compatible if and only if D = A\u22121; compare\nWolpert [27]. Why do we need an inverse? If we were dealing with the case where \u3008A,B\u3009 and \u3008C,D\u3009\nare Fuchsian groups then saying that D = A\u22121 means that A and D have the same (oriented) axis\nbut that the universal covers of the two three-holed spheres are subsets of the hyperbolic plane\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 26\non opposite sides of the axis (perhaps by adopting the convention that, when viewed from inside\nthe surface the orientation on the boundary curves is always to the right). We can make sense\nof this idea in the complex hyperbolic setting by equivariantly embedding the universal covers of\nour three-holed spheres into H2\nC\nso that the boundary curves are mapped onto the axes of A, B,\nB\u22121A\u22121 and their conjugates. We leave the details of this to the reader.\nA complex hyperbolic Fenchel-Nielsen twist-bend consists of taking these two three-holed spheres\ninH2\nC\nthat are glued together along the axis of A = D\u22121 and, while fixing the surface corresponding\nto \u3008A,B\u3009, moving the surface corresponding to \u3008C,D\u3009 by a hyperbolic translation along the axis\nof A (the twist) and a rotation around the complex axis of A (the bend). In other words, we take\na map K that commutes with A = D\u22121 and we conjugate \u3008C,D\u3009 by K. A twist by a hyperbolic\ndistance k \u2208 R corresponds to K being purely hyperbolic with trace 2 cosh(k\/2) + 1 = \u03c4(k\/2)\nand a bend through an angle \u03b2 \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0] corresponds to K being a boundary elliptic with trace\n2ei\u03b2\/3 + e\u22122i\u03b2\/3 = \u03c4(\u03b2\/3). Putting this together, we see that if tr(K) = \u03c4(\u03ba) = \u03c4(\u2212\u03ba) then K\ncorresponds to a twist through distance \u00b1\u211c(2\u03ba) and a bend through angle \u2111(3\u03ba) = \u2111(\u22123\u03ba). We\nremark that the ambiguity in the sign of the twist is also present when passing from twists to\ntraces in the classical construction as well; see [18]. We call \u03ba defined in this way the twist-bend\nparameter. In the above description we started with a given way of attaching \u3008A,B\u3009 to \u3008C,D\u3009 to\nform the group \u3008A,B,C\u3009 and then performed the twist-bend relative to this initial choice of group.\nWe remark that the twist-bend is not an absolute invariant but must always be chosen relative to\nsome starting group \u3008A,B,C\u3009. We are free to fix this group once and for all at the beginning.\nThe issue of the direction of twist is subtle and it can be very easy to introduce ambiguities. So\nwe now make very clear what we are doing. Conjugating if necessary, we assume that aA =\u221e and\nrA = o. This means that A = E(\u03bb) for some \u03bb \u2208 S. Let \u03ba \u2208 C with \u2212\u03c0 < \u2111(\u03ba) \u2264 \u03c0. Then we\ndefine K = E(\u03ba), that is:\nK = E(\u03ba) =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0e\u03ba 0 00 e\u03ba\u2212\u03ba 0\n0 0 e\u2212\u03ba\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb .\nIf \u211c(\u03ba) > 0 then \u03ba \u2208 S and K is loxodromic. Its attractive fixed point is aK = aA and its repulsive\nfixed point is rK = rA. Thus the twist goes in the same direction as A (from rA to aA). If \u211c(\u03ba) = 0\nthen K is boundary elliptic and \u03ba corresponds to a pure bend, that is there is no twist. If \u211c(\u03ba) < 0\nthen \u2212\u03ba \u2208 S and again K is loxodromic. This time aK = rA and rK = aA and the twist goes in\nthe opposite direction to A. We say that the twist-bend parameter \u03ba is oriented consistently with\nA if when we write A = QE(\u03bb)Q\u22121 the matrix K is given by QE(\u03ba)Q\u22121. Note that with respect\nto \u3008C,D\u3009 we must twist \u3008A,B\u3009 by K\u22121. The orientation of K\u22121 with respect to D = A\u22121 is the\nsame as that of K with respect to A. In other words, \u2212\u03ba is oriented consistently with D.\nA crucial special case is when either \u3008A,B\u3009 or \u3008C,D\u3009 preserves a complex line. In this case there\nare no bends. In order to see that, we observe that if \u3008A,B\u3009 preserves a complex line then it must\nbe LA, the complex axis of A. Moreover, if K is a boundary elliptic commuting with A then it too\nfixes LA. Hence K commutes with both A and B and so leaves \u3008A,B\u3009 unchanged. Hence there is no\nbending in this case. This phenomenon contributes to the reduction in the number of parameters\nfor representations whose Toledo invariant is \u00b1\u03c7(\u03a3), that is surface groups that preserve complex\nlines.\nWe need to find a conjugation invariant way of measuring the twist-bend parameter \u03ba. We do this\nusing the cross-ratios of the fixed points aA = rKDK\u22121, rA = aKDK\u22121, aB and rKCK\u22121 = K(rC).\nWe define\n(8.1) X\u02dc1(\u03ba) = [aB , aA, rA,K(rC)], X\u02dc2(\u03ba) = [aB , rA, aA,K(rC)].\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 27\nNote that if aB = K(rC) then both of these cross-ratios are infinite. We remark that the angular\ninvariants A(aA, rA, aB) and A\n(\naA, rA,K(rC)\n)\nare independent of \u03ba. For the latter one, we see\nthis by observing that A\n(\nK(aA),K(rA),K(rC)\n)\n= A(aA, rA, rC), Then using Proposition 5.8 we\nsee that there are in fact only two degrees of freedom in X\u02dc1(\u03ba) and X\u02dc2(\u03ba), as we should expect.\nProposition 8.1. Let A, B and C be loxodromic transformations. Let aA, rA, aB, rB, aC , rC be\nthe fixed points of A, B and C respectively. Suppose that neither aB nor rC lies on LA, the complex\naxis of A. Let \u03ba and \u03ba\u2032 be twist-bend parameters that are oriented consistently with A. If\nX\u02dc1(\u03ba) = X\u02dc1(\u03ba\n\u2032) and X\u02dc2(\u03ba) = X\u02dc2(\u03ba\n\u2032)\n(which are possibly infinity) then \u03ba = \u03ba\u2032.\nProof. Without loss of generality, suppose that aA =\u221e and rA = o. That is A = E(\u03bb), K = E(\u03ba)\nand K \u2032 = E(\u03ba\u2032) where \u03bb \u2208 S and \u03ba, \u03ba\u2032 are any complex numbers with \u2111(\u03ba), \u2111(\u03ba\u2032) \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0]. Write\nlifts of aB , rB, aC and rC as\naB =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0ad\ng\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb , rB =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0cf\nj\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb , aC =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0a\u2032d\u2032\ng\u2032\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb , rC =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0c\u2032f \u2032\nj\u2032\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb .\nThen\nX\u02dc1(\u03ba) =\n\u3008KrC ,\u221e\u3009\u3008o,aB\u3009\n\u3008KrC ,aB\u3009\u3008o,\u221e\u3009\n=\ne\u2212\u03baj\u2032a\ne\u2212\u03baj\u2032a+ e\u03ba\u2212\u03baf \u2032d+ e\u03bac\u2032g\n,\nX\u02dc2(\u03ba) =\n\u3008KrC ,o\u3009\u3008\u221e,aB\u3009\n\u3008KrC ,aB\u3009\u3008\u221e,o\u3009\n=\ne\u03bac\u2032g\ne\u2212\u03baj\u2032a+ e\u03ba\u2212\u03baf \u2032d+ e\u03bac\u2032g\n.\nSince we know that aB and rC are distinct from o and \u221e we automatically see that neither X\u02dc1(\u03ba)\nnor X\u02dc2(\u03ba) is zero. Since neither aB nor rC lies on LA, using Corollaries 5.9 and 5.4, we see that\nX\u02dc1(\u03ba) + X\u02dc2(\u03ba) 6= 1.\nIf X\u02dc1(\u03ba) is infinite then aB = K(rC). But X\u02dc1(\u03ba\n\u2032) must also be infinite and so aB = K\n\u2032(rC).\nThus K\u22121K \u2032 = E(\u03ba\u2032 \u2212 \u03ba) fixes rC . Thus either \u03ba\n\u2032 = \u03ba or else rC lies in LA, a contradiction.\nSuppose that X\u02dc1(\u03ba) = X\u02dc1(\u03ba\n\u2032) is finite (and non-zero). Since X\u02dc1(\u03ba)+X\u02dc2(\u03ba) = X\u02dc1(\u03ba\n\u2032)+X\u02dc2(\u03ba\n\u2032) 6= 1,\nwe have\ne2\u03ba\u2212\u03ba\nf \u2032d\nj\u2032a\n=\n1\u2212 X\u02dc1(\u03ba)\u2212 X\u02dc2(\u03ba)\nX\u02dc1(\u03ba)\n=\n1\u2212 X\u02dc1(\u03ba\n\u2032)\u2212 X\u02dc2(\u03ba\n\u2032)\nX\u02dc1(\u03ba\u2032)\n= e2\u03ba\n\u2032\u2212\u03ba\u2032 f\n\u2032d\nj\u2032a\n.\nThus e2\u03ba\n\u2032\u2212\u03ba\u2032 = e2\u03ba\u2212\u03ba and so \u03ba = \u03ba\u2032. \u0003\nCorollary 8.2. Let A, B and C be loxodromic transformations. Suppose that neither \u3008A,B\u3009 nor\n\u3008A,C\u3009 preserves a complex line. Let \u03ba and \u03ba\u2032 be twist-bend parameters that are oriented consistently\nwith A and let K and K \u2032 be the corresponding elements of SU(2, 1) that commute with A. Then\n\u3008A, B, KCK\u22121\u3009 = \u3008A, B, K \u2032CK \u2032\u22121\u3009 if and only if \u03ba = \u03ba\u2032.\nProof. Clearly if \u03ba = \u03ba\u2032 then K = K \u2032 and \u3008A, B, KCK\u22121\u3009 = \u3008A, B, K \u2032CK \u2032\u22121\u3009.\nConversely, let aA, rA, aB , rB , aC and rC denote the fixed points of A, B, C. Suppose that\nneither aB nor rC lies on LA. Since \u3008A, B, KCK\n\u22121\u3009 = \u3008A, B, K \u2032CK \u2032\u22121\u3009 we have\n[aB , aA, rA,K(rC)] = [aB , aA, rA,K\n\u2032(rC)] and [aB , rA, aA,K(rC)] = [aB , rA, aA,K\n\u2032(rC)].\nFrom Proposition 8.1 we have \u03ba = \u03ba\u2032.\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 28\nIf aB lies on LA then, since \u3008A,B\u3009 does not preserve LA, we see that rB does not lie on LA.\nThus repeating the above argument with B\u22121 in place of B gives the result. Likewise if rC lies on\nLA then we replace C with C\n\u22121. \u0003\n8.2. Attaching pairs of three-holed spheres. We define a (0, 4) subgroup of SU(2, 1) to be\na group with four loxodromic generators satisfying the single relation that their product is the\nidentity. These four loxodromic maps correspond to the boundary curves and (their conjugacy\nclasses) are called peripheral. Note that the (0, 4) group is freely generated by any three of these\nloxodromic maps.\nLet \u3008A,B\u3009 and \u3008C,D\u3009 be two (0, 3)-groups with A = D\u22121. We now show how to construct\na (0, 4) group from \u3008A,B\u3009 and \u3008C,D\u3009. Algebraically this is done by taking the free product of\n\u3008A,B\u3009 and \u3008C,D\u3009 with amalgamation along the common cyclic subgroup \u3008A\u3009 = \u3008D\u3009. We are free\nto conjugate \u3008C,D\u3009 by any K \u2208 SU(2, 1) that commutes with A = D\u22121 and doing so yields a new\n(0, 4) group depending on K. As explained above, varying this K corresponds to a Fenchel-Nielsen\ntwist deformation.\nLemma 8.3. Suppose that \u03931 = \u3008A,B\u3009 and \u03932 = \u3008C,D\u3009 are two (0, 3) groups with peripheral\nelements A, B, B\u22121A\u22121 and C, D and D\u22121C\u22121 respectively. Moreover suppose that A = D\u22121.\nLet K be any element of SU(2, 1) that commutes with A = D\u22121. Then the group \u3008A,B,KCK\u22121\u3009\nis a (0, 4)-group with peripheral elements B, B\u22121A\u22121, KCK\u22121 and KD\u22121C\u22121K\u22121.\nProof. The loxodromic transformations\nB, B\u22121A\u22121, KD\u22121C\u22121K\u22121, KCK\u22121\ngenerate a (0, 4) group since we see that their product is\n(B)(B\u22121A\u22121)(KD\u22121C\u22121K\u22121)(KCK\u22121) = A\u22121KD\u22121K\u22121.\nwhich is the identity since D = A\u22121 and KAK\u22121 = A. \u0003\nNote that in Lemma 8.3 the generator D is redundant and so we just speak of the (0, 4) group\n\u3008A,B,KCK\u22121\u3009 obtained from the (0, 3) groups \u3008A,B\u3009 and K\u3008C,A\u22121\u3009K\u22121 by gluing along A with\ntwist-bend parameter \u03ba corresponding to K, relative to some specified group. We then associate\nto \u3008A,B,KCK\u22121\u3009 the four complex numbers\ntr(A), tr(B), tr(C), \u03ba\ntogether with a point on each of the cross-ratio varieties X(A,B) and X(A,C). We call these sixteen\nreal parameters the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates of \u3008A,B,KCK\u22121\u3009. As remarked above, if either\nof the (0, 3) groups \u3008A,B\u3009 or \u3008C,A\u22121\u3009 preserves a complex line (that is LA equals LB or LC) then\nthe twist-bend parameter must be real.\nTheorem 8.4. Suppose that \u3008A,B\u3009 and \u3008C,A\u22121\u3009 are two (0, 3) groups neither of which preserves a\ncomplex line. Let \u03ba be a twist-bend parameter oriented consistently with A and let \u3008A,B,KCK\u22121\u3009\nbe the corresponding (0, 4) group. Then \u3008A,B,KCK\u22121\u3009 is uniquely determined up to conjugation\nin SU(2, 1) by its Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates: a point on each of the cross-ratio varieties X(A,B)\nand X(A,C) together with the four complex numbers\ntr(A), tr(B), tr(C), \u03ba\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 29\nProof. Suppose that \u3008A,B,KCK\u22121\u3009 and \u3008A\u2032, B\u2032,K \u2032C \u2032K \u2032\u22121\u3009 are two (0, 4) groups with\ntr(A) = tr(A\u2032), tr(B) = tr(B\u2032), tr(C) = tr(C \u2032), \u03ba = \u03ba\u2032\nand\nX1(A,B) = X1(A\n\u2032, B\u2032), X2(A,B) = X2(A\n\u2032, B\u2032), X3(A,B) = X3(A\n\u2032, B\u2032),\nX1(A,C) = X1(A\n\u2032, C \u2032), X2(A,C) = X2(A\n\u2032, C \u2032), X3(A,C) = X3(A\n\u2032, C \u2032).\nSince the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates of \u3008A,B\u3009 and \u3008A\u2032, B\u2032\u3009 are the same, then using Theorem 7.1,\nthey are conjugate. Conjugating if necessary, we suppose that A = A\u2032 and B = B\u2032. Similarly\n\u3008C,A\u22121\u3009 and \u3008C \u2032, A\u2032\u22121\u3009 are conjugate. The twist-bend parameters must be defined relative to the\nsame initial group which we take to be \u3008A,B,C\u3009. Then by construction, since \u03ba = \u03ba\u2032 it is clear\nthat \u3008A,B,KCK\u22121\u3009 and \u3008A\u2032, B\u2032,K \u2032C \u2032K \u2032\u22121\u3009 are conjugate.\nConversely suppose that \u3008A,B,KCK\u22121\u3009 and \u3008A\u2032, B\u2032,K \u2032C \u2032K \u2032\u22121\u3009 are conjugate. Then clearly\ntr(A) = tr(A\u2032), tr(B) = tr(B\u2032) and tr(C) = tr(C \u2032). Also because cross-ratios are SU(2, 1) invariant\nwe also have Xi(A,B) = Xi(A\n\u2032, B\u2032) and Xi(A,C) = Xi(A\n\u2032, C \u2032) for i = 1, 2, 3. Thus it remains to\nshow that \u03ba = \u03ba\u2032. Again using the invariance of cross-ratios, we have\n[aB , aA, rA,K(rC)] = [aB , aA, rA,K\n\u2032(rC)] and [aB , rA, aA,K(rC)] = [aB , rA, aA,K\n\u2032(rC)].\nIn other words, X\u02dc1(\u03ba) = X\u02dc1(\u03ba\n\u2032) and X\u02dc2(\u03ba) = X\u02dc2(\u03ba\n\u2032). Using Proposition 8.1 we see that \u03ba = \u03ba\u2032. \u0003\n8.3. Closing a handle. Most of the results of this section run in parallel with the corresponding\nresults in the previous section. We will be interested in the case of one-holed tori in complex\nhyperbolic space obtained by attaching two of the boundary components of a single three-holed\nsphere. We call the process of attaching these two ends closing a handle. For this to work, one of the\nperipheral elements of the corresponding (0, 3) group must be conjugate to the inverse of another,\nso that they are compatible. Suppose that these two (conjugacy classes of) peripheral elements are\nA and BA\u22121B\u22121, which we suppose are loxodromic. Clearly the (0, 3) group is freely generated\nby A and BA\u22121B\u22121 and, by hypothesis the third peripheral element BAB\u22121A\u22121 = [B,A] must\nalso be loxodromic. A (1, 1) subgroup \u0393 of SU(2, 1) is a group that corresponds to a one-holed\ntorus. That is, this group has three generators A,B,C where C is the commutator of A and B,\nthat is, C = [B,A] = BAB\u22121A\u22121 (and so A(BA\u22121B\u22121)C is the identity). In particular, \u0393 is freely\ngenerated by A,B. From the group theory point of view, closing a handle is the same as taking\nthe HNN-extension of the (0, 3) group \u3008A,BA\u22121B\u22121\u3009 by adjoining the element B to form a (1, 1)\ngroup. Hence our (1, 1) group is \u3008A,B\u3009 and its peripheral element is BAB\u22121A\u22121, which is not\naffected by our attaching operation.\nClearly when we close a handle (that is when we take the HNN-extension) the map B is not\nunique. IfK is any element of SU(2, 1) that commutes with A then (BK)A\u22121(BK)\u22121 = BA\u22121B\u22121.\nSo we could just as well have taken our (1, 1) group to be \u3008A,BK\u3009. Varying K corresponds to\na Fenchel-Nielsen twist-bend as above. If A = QE(\u03bb)Q\u22121 for \u03bb \u2208 S we define the twist-bend\nparameter \u03ba by K = QE(\u03ba)Q\u22121 just as before, and we say that \u03ba is oriented consistently with A.\nAgain \u03ba is any complex number with \u2212\u03c0 < \u2111(\u03ba) \u2264 \u03c0 and the real part of \u03ba corresponds to a twist\nand its imaginary part to a bend. Also, just as before, \u03ba is only defined relative to a fixed reference\ngroup.\nProposition 8.5. Let \u3008A,BA\u22121B\u22121\u3009 be a (0, 3) group. Let B be a fixed choice of an element in\nSU(2, 1) conjugating A\u22121 to BA\u22121B\u22121. Let \u03ba and \u03ba\u2032 be twist-bend parameters oriented consistently\nwith A. Then \u3008A,BK\u3009 is conjugate to \u3008A,BK \u2032\u3009 if and only if \u03ba = \u03ba\u2032.\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 30\nProof. Clearly if \u03ba = \u03ba\u2032 then BK = BK \u2032 and the groups are equal.\nConversely, suppose that \u3008A,BK\u3009 is conjugate to \u3008A,BK \u2032\u3009 are conjugate. Then the conjugating\nelement D must commute with A, and so fixes aA and rA. Since BA\n\u22121B\u22121 is specified we must\nhave\nBA\u22121B\u22121 = (BK \u2032)A\u22121(BK \u2032)\u22121 = (DBKD\u22121)A\u22121(DBKD\u22121)\u22121 = D(BA\u22121B\u22121)D\u22121.\nThus D also commutes with BA\u22121B\u22121 and so fixes aBA\u22121B\u22121 = B(rA) and rBA\u22121B\u22121 = B(aA).\nAs these fixed points are distinct, the only possibilities are that either D is the identity or else aA,\nrA, B(rA) and B(aA) all lie on a complex line fixed by D. In the latter case D commutes with B\nas well as A (and hence with K and K \u2032). Thus in either case BK \u2032 = DBKD\u22121 = BK. In other\nwords, K = K \u2032 and so \u03ba = \u03ba\u2032 as required. \u0003\nSuppose that \u3008A,BK\u3009 is a (1, 1) group obtained by closing the handle in the (0, 3) group\n\u3008A,BA\u22121B\u22121\u3009 with twist-bend parameter \u03ba. Then we associate to \u3008A,BK\u3009 a point on the cross-\nratio variety X(A,BA\u22121B\u22121) and the two complex numbers tr(A) and \u03ba. We call these parameters\nthe Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates of \u3008A,BK\u3009: Our main theorem in this section is\nTheorem 8.6. The (1, 1) group \u3008A,BK\u3009 is determined up to conjugation in SU(2, 1) by its Fenchel-\nNielsen coordinates: a point on the cross-ratio variety X(A,BA\u22121B\u22121) and the complex numbers\ntr(A) and \u03ba.\nProof. Suppose that \u3008A,BK\u3009 and \u3008A\u2032, B\u2032K \u2032\u3009 are two (1, 1) groups with the same Fenchel-Nielsen\ncoordinates. In particular, tr(A) = tr(A\u2032) and so\ntr(BA\u22121B\u22121) = tr(A) = tr(A\u2032) = tr(B\u2032A\u2032\u22121B\u2032\u22121).\nMoreover, Xi(A,BA\n\u22121B\u22121) = Xi(A\n\u2032, B\u2032A\u2032\u22121B\u2032\u22121) for i = 1, 2, 3, so we see that the (0, 3) groups\n\u3008A,BA\u22121B\u22121\u3009 and \u3008A\u2032, B\u2032A\u2032\u22121B\u2032\u22121\u3009 have the same Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates and so, using\nTheorem 7.1, are conjugate. Thus we may suppose that A = A\u2032 and BA\u22121B\u22121 = B\u2032A\u2032\u22121B\u2032\u22121.\nUsing Proposition 8.5 we see that, since \u03ba = \u03ba\u2032 (with reference to the same conjugating element\nB = B\u2032), then \u3008A,BK\u3009 and \u3008A\u2032, B\u2032K \u2032\u3009 are conjugate.\nConversely, suppose that \u3008A,BK\u3009 and \u3008A\u2032, B\u2032K \u2032\u3009 are conjugate. It is clear that tr(A) = tr(A\u2032),\nXi(A,BA\n\u22121B\u22121) = Xi(A\n\u2032, B\u2032A\u2032\u22121B\u2032\u22121) for i = 1, 2, 3. Conjugating if necessary, we may suppose\nthat A = A\u2032 and B = B\u2032 (the latter being a fixed choice of conjugating element with reference to\nwhich \u03ba and \u03ba\u2032 are defined). Again using Proposition 8.5, we see that \u03ba = \u03ba\u2032. \u0003\n8.4. Twist-bends for groups preserving a complex line. We now consider what happens\nwhen we attach two (0, 3) groups \u3008A,B\u3009 or \u3008A,C\u3009 (at least) one of which preserves a complex\nline. In this case, as indicated above, there can be no bending around this complex line and so\nthe twist-bend parameter degenerates into a real twist parameter which we call k. Once again k is\nonly defined relative to a specific reference group. More precisely, we cannot distinguish between\ndifferent bending angles (rather like the origin in polar coordinates). Thus, in the irreducible case,\na group where one of the (0, 3) groups preserves a complex line can be the limit of groups which\ndo not preserve a complex line and which have any bending angles. In the reducible case, all the\nbending angles between distinct (0, 3) groups are undetermined at each point and we take them all\nto be identically zero.\nProposition 8.7. Let A, B and C be loxodromic transformations. Let aA, rA, aB, rB, aC , rC be\nthe fixed points of A, B and C respectively. Suppose that either aB and rB or aC and rC lie on LA,\nCOMPLEX HYPERBOLIC FENCHEL-NIELSEN COORDINATES 31\nthe complex axis of A. Let k and k\u2032 be (real) twist parameters oriented consistently with A and let\nK and K \u2032 be the corresponding matrices in SU(2, 1) that commute with A. If\nX\u02dc1(k) = X\u02dc1(k\n\u2032) and X\u02dc2(k) = X\u02dc2(k\n\u2032)\n(which are possibly infinity) then k = k\u2032.\nProof. This is similar to the proof of Proposition 8.1. Again we suppose that A = E(\u03bb), K = E(k)\nand K \u2032 = E(k\u2032). In this case Corollaries 5.9 and 5.4 imply X\u02dc1(k) + X\u02dc2(k) = X\u02dc1(k\n\u2032) + X\u02dc2(k\n\u2032) = 1\nWith the notation used in the proof of Proposition 8.1, we have:\nX\u02dc1(k) =\n\u3008KrC ,\u221e\u3009\u3008o,aB\u3009\n\u3008KrC ,aB\u3009\u3008o,\u221e\u3009\n=\ne\u2212kj\u2032a\ne\u2212kj\u2032a+ ekc\u2032g\n, X\u02dc1(k\n\u2032) =\ne\u2212k\n\u2032\nj\u2032a\ne\u2212k\u2032j\u2032a+ ek\u2032c\u2032g\n,\nX\u02dc2(k) =\n\u3008KrC ,o\u3009\u3008\u221e,aB\u3009\n\u3008KrC ,aB\u3009\u3008\u221e,o\u3009\n=\nekc\u2032g\ne\u2212kj\u2032a+ ekc\u2032g\n, X\u02dc2(k\n\u2032) =\nek\n\u2032\nc\u2032g\ne\u2212k\u2032j\u2032a+ ek\u2032c\u2032g\n,\nThus\ne2k\n\u2032 c\u2032g\nj\u2032a\n=\nX\u02dc2(k\n\u2032)\nX\u02dc1(k\u2032)\n=\nX\u02dc2(k)\nX\u02dc1(k)\n= e2k\nc\u2032g\nj\u2032a\n.\nHence k\u2032 = k as claimed. \u0003\nCorollary 8.8. Let A = QE(\u03bb)Q\u22121, B and C be loxodromic transformations. Suppose that one\nor both of \u3008A,B\u3009 or \u3008C,A\u22121\u3009 preserves a complex line. Let k and k\u2032 be twist parameters oriented\nconsistently with A and let K and K \u2032 be the corresponding matrices in SU(2, 1) that commute with\nA. Then \u3008A, B, KCK\u22121\u3009 = \u3008A, B, K \u2032CK \u2032\u22121\u3009 if and only if k = k\u2032.\nWe could mimic the proof of Theorem 8.4 and show that if either \u3008A,B\u3009 or \u3008C,A\u22121\u3009 preserves\na complex line then (0, 4) group \u3008A,B,KCK\u22121\u3009 is uniquely determined by its Fenchel-Nielsen\nparameters. The main difference is that some of the parameters that were complex will now be\nreal. For example, if \u3008A,B\u3009 preserves a complex line then X1(A,B) and X2(A,B) are both real\nand satisfy X3(A,B) = \u2212X2(A,B)\/X1(A,B) and X1(A,B) + X2(A,B) = 1. Moreover \u03ba = k is\nreal. The details in the case where the whole surface group (and so each (0, 3) group) preserves a\ncomplex line are given in Section 2.2.\nFinally, we remark that, unlike the (0, 4) case, even if the (0, 3) group \u3008A,BA\u22121B\u22121\u3009 preserves\na complex line, if we close the handle to obtain \u3008A,BK\u3009, the twist-bend parameter \u03ba associated\nto K is still complex. The point is that we are not conjugating by K and so we can see the effect\nof twists around LA. This is even the case when the whole surface group preserves a complex line.\nIn other words, there is still a two parameter family of ways to close a handle in (0, 3) groups that\npreserve a complex line.\nReferences\n[1] E\u00b4.
