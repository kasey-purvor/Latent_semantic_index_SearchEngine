These are incorporated in, and indeed help make up, the\nVisioning Process Model, which not only outlines the make up of the positive\nVisioning Process, but also clearly shows the effect and pathway of its opposite \u2013 the\nDivisioning effect.\nThe two vertical pathways meet at the point of the leader\u2019s choice and it is\ndemonstrated how this choice has a number of knock-on effects and creates residual\ncausal loops of either a virtuous or vicious nature depending on the direction taken.\n33\nIntroduction\nVision is important to leadership, strategy implementation and change (Larwood\n1995) but whether it is a form of overall leadership in itself or just one of the critical\ntasks a leaders must perform to demonstrate their competence is unclear.\nA pattern of organisational values may make up vision or there may exist a difference\nbetween vision itself in terms of its process and content and the whole role it plays in\ntransformational leadership.\nIf vision is the projected image of the products, services and organisation that a\nbusiness leader wishes to achieve (Bennis 1985) or \u201can ideal and unique image of the\nfuture\u201d (Kouzes and Postner 1987), then vision as one of the business senses is\nperhaps less about actual sight than it is foresight. Vision can be divided from\nforesight where there are those who think foresight is a plural activity, yet a vision can\nstem from an individual with the sceptical thought that vision can originate from the\nego of the CEO (Hamel and Prahalad, 1996).\nWhether singular or plural, the term \u2018visioning\u2019 then appears to be more future led as\nit suggests the active occupation of looking ahead rather than merely looking at or\nanalysing something. But is it that simple? By looking ahead, one can foresee events\nand indeed avoid catastrophes or even positively prepare for economic change, but\nsuch prediction is only a narrow part of any true visioning process. The full visioning\n44\npackage must involve a full commitment to a whole strategic direction and\nsubsequently the strategic planning processes that go with it. But more than predict\nand react to what is understood to be the future, true visioning creates that future and\nproactively shapes it. Much more than the ideal that represents and reflects the shared\nvalues to which the organisation should aspire (House and Shamir 1993).\nComplicated in make up, visioning may be more evolutionary in terms of its\nnecessary components than revolutionary and include the company\u2019s executional\ncapability (Hamel and Prahalad, 1996).\nSuch conviction to craft the future is one of the seven sides of the great leader. The six\nsupporting sides being the strength to surface sentiments, a wisdom for pathways\nthrough paradox, a flair to engage through dialogue, a discipline to communicate, a\npassion for results and staying power (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 1999). With the\nfirst of these then \u2013 conviction to craft the future \u2013 or visioning - goes the\nresponsibility for all that it takes to get there. So it is not as simple as creating a long-\nterm strategic direction based on knowledge of the business and intellectual\npredictions. This is just the starting block and it is a race where the exact place of the\nfinishing tape is the first decision followed by further decisions as to the route to get\nthere, how to get there and who takes it there. The approach is top-down with the\nlong-term goal isolated. The short term components and sub-components are then\nsmaller goals to get there rather than fire-fighting tactics arrived at on a bottom-up\nbasis.\n55\nThree core components of this journey can be isolated when reviewing charismatic\nleadership theories. It is suggested that these components are the communication of\nthe vision, the possession of a charismatic personality style to gain the following and\nthen the taking of the various necessary actions intended to actually implement the\nvision (Baum 1998).\nCharismatic leadership is neither personality based nor contextually determined but\nmore relational and perceptual: \u201cit is not what the leader is but what people see the\nleader as that counts in generating charismatic relationship\u201d (Willner 1984). This must\nbe key in visioning and there must be a close link between any vision and the ability\nof the leader to actually communicate it as a \u201cmeaning maker\u201d (Conger 1991). Conger\nsupports Baum\u2019s direction in the make up of visioning and his six guidelines also\nsuggest that it is not only a natural process but one that can be manufactured and\nlearned:\n1. Frame your organisation\u2019s mission around intrinsically appealing goals\n2. Incorporate positive values with stories\n3. Highlight key belief categories\n4. Employ more analogies, metaphors etc. when speaking\n5. When communicating try various rhetorical techniques\n6. Allow own emotions to surface\nSo key themes emerge, the level of personal commitment to the cause or at least the\nability to show it cosmetically, repeating the key values and ensuring it is\ncommunicated in the right way for the audience.\n66\nVision without morality is nothing less than self interest. Ensuring the values are\npivotal to the overall vision is important. Successful visionary leadership not only\ncrafts the end future goal and how to get there but also the reasons for doing so and\nwhat that means not only to the company and its profits but also to the teams, and\nmost importantly, to the individuals which make up those teams. There is a certain\nmoral responsibility for ensuring each individual gets their own personal value out of\nthe visioning journey in addition to buying in to the key values of that vision as being\nright and good for the company.\nSo \u201cvision can be defined as an organised perception or phenomenon. It is an\nimagined or perceived pattern of communal possibilities to which others can be\ndrawn, given the necessary enthusiasm and momentum on the part of the leader who\nis promulgating that vision\u201d (Mordon 1997).\nVision becomes a future to be created rather than a forecast (Parikh 1993) and is an\noverarching concept under which a wide variety of other concepts are subsumed\n(Collins 1991).\nCreative transformation is risky and this change process involves the use of emotional\nintelligence and emotional alchemy as well as a healthy and realistic attitude to\ninevitable bifurcation points (Cooper and Sawaf, 2000) in addition to the other skills\nmentioned to reduce the risk and increase the chances of success. This is not just\nabout being in tune with one\u2019s own emotional depth but that of the workforce and\nunderstanding the practical actions and motivations necessary to head towards the\n77\noverall desired outcome as well as use the unexpected collisions as a positive\nexperience to improve.\nOne overall definition of visioning looks less and less likely and the necessary\nincorporation of these subsumations in any emerging management tool becomes\nsomething of an obligation.\nIf vision is direction the question also arises as to what exactly the mission of the\nbusiness is \u2013 perhaps it is the purpose or meaning of that direction. These two partners\nare fashionably sported together. Most corporate literature of our age contains a very\ncarefully worded vision and mission statement but there can be much confusion\nbetween the two and original meanings can be lost in the repetitive wheel out of new\nstaff during robotic induction. Vision and mission are words whose power is\novershadowed only by the confusion which surrounds them (Raynor 1998).\nDirection and purpose must be worked together by the successful leader. Visioning\ncould then be a blend of the two. The vision is future oriented, compelling, bold,\naspiring, and inspiring, yet believable and achievable (Levin 2000) and the mission\ncould provide the rationale for the action to achieve (Campbell 1991).\nWhatever the confusion between mission and vision it does become clear that the\nleader must be participative to gain employee commitment to the cause (Brabet &\nKlemm 1994). Participating in a series of purposes helps affect the overall direction\nbut only after that direction is defined where \u201cvision is a part rational (the product of\nanalysis) and part emotional (the product of imagination, hunches and values)\u201d and\n88\nmay bring us closer to a true definition of visioning. As a precursor to mission,\nstrategic development, goals, values etc. and a proactive force which precedes them,\nvisioning is the driving force. From \u201ca coherent and powerful statement of what the\nbusiness can and be (n) years hence\u201d (Wilson, 1992), visioning combines many\naspects of the strategic leadership process with organisational focus at all levels.\nDiscussion\nIn order to understand why visioning is so important a look at the potential\nconsequences of the lack of it may reveal its necessity. Just what might happen to an\norganisation without a clear and specific vision? If all the business team members are\nnot facing in the same long\u2013term direction, just what would be the effects of a more\nchaotic and multidirectional short term approach? (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 1999).\nFour steps backwards \u2013 without effective visioning\nIn their study of leadership capabilities Kakabadse and Kakabadse (1999) identified\nfour reasons why some organisations fail to achieve their goals. These four reasons\nintertwine and evolve from and with each other.\n1. Organisational chaos resulting from divisions in the\nranks gives rise to a divided company and so\nOrganisational Division.\n2. Paradoxical empowerment where the different agendas\nof the empowered ranks conflict and cause confusion.\nThe Paradox in Empowerment then divides the\ncompany further.\n99\n3. In-fighting which turns the corporate energy in on itself\nnegatively. The Internal War then eats away at the\ncompany\u2019s competitive advantage.\n4. Short-term orientation as a result of a survivalist\ninternal environment. Such Short-termism becomes\ninfectious and habitual so weakening the long-term\nability of the company.\nOrganisational Division\nWith no one long \u2013term direction clear to all, many directions evolve from within the\norganisation from different levels and from different individuals with many and\ndifferent opinions. By law of probability it is not long before several of these conflict\nleading to divided purpose and internal combustion.\nMuch energy is then spent dealing with the dissension rather than externally\npromoting the business or fighting off competitors. The resulting contradiction is\ncostly as the use of resources is not applied in the most effective way towards\nattaining results and indeed the duplication of effort drains the said supply more\nquickly.\nSplits of vision through the ranks are problematic enough but can also occur within\nthe senior team. It is one thing having no clear vision or purpose at all but yet another\nhaving several company songs to sing from competing members of the top ranks. If\ndifferent views regarding the direction and purpose of the company in the future are\nevident from the leading ranks then the chaos is cascaded. This creates internal\n10\n10\ncompetition that will result in poor management of the organisation, a declining\nperformance from the business and massive issues of morale with employees who\nhave less respect for the company.\nSo it is back to inefficient use of resources \u2013 this time the human ones- where it is\ninevitable unhappy staff will leave taking their talent and knowledge of the business\nwith them and probably use it more effectively with and for the external competition.\nWhere top ranks are unable to deal with their frictions and leave the boardroom\nwithout democratically deciding on a single direction, the resulting tensions from the\nsplit approach become the focus for the subsequent ranks within the company. The\nstrained relationships and divided loyalties lead to a lack of trust and resentment.\nPurpose and direction become caught up in a vicious and downward spiral and the\ncorporate eye is distracted from and taken off dealing with the external environment\nso reducing its ability to cope with marketplace developments. Blades which should\nbe on the outside of the chariot chopping at the legs of the competition are inside it\nchopping at their own. There develops paradox in the dissected empowerment as each\nmember must think in survivalist manner.\nParadox in empowerment\nThis closely links to and can cause or derive from the organisational division above.\nAs if different directions were not enough to cause damage to the company, an\nevolution occurs within the empowered ranks amidst the confusion. Without an\noverall vision to believe in and wholeheartedly work for, the different levels of\nmanagement develop alternative agendas in addition to alternative directions so\n11\n11\nconvoluting the issue further. This increases the chance of contradiction and further\nconflict within the company as the internal surface area inflames. Even where the\nmanagement levels of the organisation have not resigned, they have become resigned\nto a \u2018why bother\u2019 attitude. They find their input meaningless and so their output is\nmore restricted and so then is that of their staff in turn. Also as some develop a\npersonal agenda to work to, especially with a view to protecting themselves and their\nteams, there develops a paradox between individual and corporate aim.\nThe vicious spiral has wound down through the ranks. Without an overall corporate\nvision or rather the joint act of visioning from the leading quarter, autonomy rules at\nsectional\/divisional level. Rather than one Strategic Business Unit made up of a\nnumber of Sharing Business Units working towards the one goal, the collection of\nSelfish Business Units bleed the corporate reserve for their own survival. As\nsuggested above, it then continues its path to the front-line individual level and\nemployee and corporation are simply not in tune. Each individual is more focused on\nfighting for their own survival than that of the company, simply because they haven\u2019t\nbeen given the direction to do so.\nWith such a survivalist approach at all levels, deriving from the organisational\ndivision or the paradox in empowerment, the resulting individual self interest not only\nsteals valuable energy from the external fighting power of the company as a whole but\nalso promotes a culture of in-fighting.\n12\n12\nInternal war\nSo it comes down to the strong promotions of one\u2019s own views, not just in terms of\ndifferences of opinion but to support a cause or belief where none exists. Once latched\nonto a direction, any direction if there is no overall alternative, all power turns to that\nand of course the protection of it. Different opinions are now beyond respect and\nacceptance as the only way forward seems to be to fight for the belief and so to\nsurvive. Colleagues with valuable and energetic input for the company become the\nenemy and the energy is spent fighting to gain ground inch by inch from the bottom\nup. This is a slow process and for every inch forward there may be one back or\nsideways as the company is pulled north, south, east and west and progresses exactly\nnowhere.\nStaff turnover is an inevitable outcome of the discontent and this is self-perpetuating.\nAs new staff eagerly join the company and find themselves caught up in the politics,\nthey too are more likely to leave without their talents having been used. The repeated\nloss of staff and re-training of new ones just to get back to point zero renders the\ncompany static at best and damages its future capacity to do the business in the\nmarket it was supposed to.\nThe working day and patterns become geared to getting through the next increment of\ntime rather than forging forward on an agreed long \u2013term route. The increments of\ntime by nature are small as without future promise all are in need of ready\nrecognition. True, this can be part of a long-term plan in successful companies and\nunder successful leaders good tactics are borne of sound strategy but without a\n13\n13\ndirection the tactics turn in on themselves. Short-term orientation renders repetitive\ndisadvantage rather than competitive advantage.\nShort-termism\nEn route to survival in this corporate world without visioning there does develop the\none common denominator among leaders of all levels \u2013 the achievement of quick\nresults. Let\u2019s not be fooled. These results are not necessarily achieved with the\ncompany\u2019s good in mind and are more geared to internal competition and survival and\ncan be achieved at any cost. In these circumstances leaders are not planning for the\nfuture but surviving for the present and will put all energies of the team into fast gain.\nThe achieved results are those of their own little company within the original larger\none and will not necessarily benefit the latter in the long-term. Indeed, it is quite\npossible that this approach weakens the long-term ability of the company by depleting\nits energy in the wrong way. Also, the repetitive nature of such short-term\nachievement month after month, by its very nature, goes nowhere as it is not refined\nby long-term purpose and direction. The short-term goal set is achieved and once so it\nis back to the original starting point for more of the same.\nShort-term goals can be valuable and have their place in long-term direction but\nwithout that positioning and belonging they form a treadmill of fire-fighting tactics\nwith no arrival point.\nHence there are four steps backwards where a shared vision is lacking. Each one leads\nto the other and each part of a causal and vicious spiral downwards in terms of the\nhealth of the business.\n14\n14\nThis lack of vision creates division then in three possible inter-linking ways which all\nin turn or simultaneously contribute to the four outcomes referred to above.\n1. Non visioning where the future only evolves from the present and instant\nresults are the main focus. This could be almost an accidental omission of\nvisioning or a careless lack of planning.\n2. Divisioneering where focus is on short-term individual or departmental\nperformance with punitive measure. This is deliberate and selfish in nature.\n3. Sub-divisioning where departments and individuals are then forced to work\nautonomously to survive for themselves rather than for the good of the whole\ncompany. This is reactive.\nFigure 1 brings these elements together to illustrate the process.\nFigure 1: Lack of Visioning\nSource: Compiled by the authors\nIonal\nment\nNONVISIONING DIVISIONEERING SUBDIVISIONING\nOrganisat-\nDivision\nParadox\nIn\nEmpower-\nInternal\nWar\nShort\nTermism\nD I V I S I O N I N G\nLack of Vision\n15\n15\nWhether lack of visioning is accidental \u2013 non visioning, deliberate- divisioneering or\nreactive- subdivisioning, it ultimately results in one, or subsequently all, of the four\nsteps backwards illustrated and so towards \u2018Divisioning\u2019. The divided then fall if no\nunity is introduced in order to make a stand towards a shared goal.\nIt would be na\u00efve to expect the complete eradication of these and that full agreement\nbetween leaders can be achieved at any one time. It should be expected that\nenthusiastic and talented senior management would hold very different personal views\nas to the future of an organisation they have great pride in. The different ideas should\nbe healthy if well used. Perhaps the difference in successful companies with one\nvision is that there is a discipline from the senior team where corporate well-being is\nparamount and rather than fight over their differences they value, manage and respect\nthem. The knowledge that any mismanagement of the internal negotiating process\ncould seriously damage the fabric of the company over-rides potential disputes and\nindeed tempers any actual ones towards productive output.\nDifferences of vision need to be cleverly addressed at all levels from corporate to\nindividual in a way which ensures the company is able to operate with its greatest\nstrengths available to it rather than turned in on it. Managing this means mastering the\njump from merely having a vision to actually visioning where the diversity is\nembraced as an integral element of the management of getting there.\nHaving looked at four elements of a vicious spiral downwards, it is considered that it\nwould be positive and prudent to do the reverse.\n16\n16\nFour steps forwards -towards effective visioning\nHaving had the ghost of fitness future haunt us with the horror of failure, it is not\ndifficult to develop the reverse. The first step is undoubtedly the leader\u2019s personal\nconviction for the cause. This must be followed by securing the commitment and\nequal conviction of their senior team. As the team cascade the visionary message and\nbreak it down into management and motivational chunks, it is essential to have a fast\nfeedback system in place so changes can be made quickly where necessary and any\nnegativity or problems picked up on as soon as possible. Finally, just as negative\nshort-termism is self-perpetuating, an opposite and upward spiral would be to create a\nvisioning culture which perpetuates itself from within in the most positive way\npossible.\nPersonal Conviction for the Cause\nThis should go without saying and is perhaps the pivotal arm of the whole visioning\nprocess. Projecting and then directing into the future is an uncertain process so it\nfollows that the intensity of conviction from the \u2018evangelist\u2019 is key. It becomes the\npersonal ambition of the \u2018visioneer\u2019 to make the vision a corporate ambition while at\nthe same time furnishing the practical processes which help the ultimate aim actually\nmaterialise. This conviction evolves from the initial dealings with the realities of\ninfluencing externalities which help form the vision in the first place through to the\nstaying power needed when dealing with the internal dynamics and politics which\ninevitably form.\n17\n17\nCommitment of the senior team\nAs previously seen mixed messages from the top will result in a mixed take up of the\nvision ethos. Visionary success must include the forming of a top team able to respect\neach other and act with and for each other. With enough room for each of their\ndiscretionary breadth, enough debate from differing quarters to form the best and\nmost reasoned approach to issues and an agreed etiquette as to actual delivery, the top\nteam should walk out of the board room door united and leaving their personal\nopinions behind.\nIn order to achieve such unity the leading visioneer may have assessments to make\nabout who is actually on that team, not just in terms of discretionary power but in\nterms of personality. Decisions as to who would bring together a potentially disparate\ngroup or who would divide a potentially united group are difficult to reach. Allowing\nenough room for the most beneficial amount of diversity yet funnelling the energy\ntowards more ready agreement provides plenty of room for visionary energies to be\ndiverted.\nInheriting a potentially disparate team means finding a quality of communication to\nbind them together and an internal marketing mechanism which not only \u2018sells in\u2019 an\nidea but achieves \u2018buy in\u2019 through a channel of respect for each of their positions in\nthe company. The top team is treated as such with differences noted, accommodated\nand highly rated with a pattern of behaviour emerging which ensures the team act as a\nwhole by agreement. This avoids the inward destruction of malicious subordination\n(Garratt, 2003) borne of reluctant obedience which dissipates quickly and divides\nloyalties.\n18\n18\nA firm respect for the input of the top team and a sound set of rules by which to\napproach the troops also helps each senior individual correctly apply their personal\naims with those of the corporation. If they are able to feel they are part of the overall\npicture they will more easily differentiate between that which they desire and what is\nactually best for the organisation in terms of achieving the vision.\nFast feedback\nOnce the top team are established in this way, a focus on the channels of\ncommunication and involvement between them and the workforce is necessary. This\nhas to be sound enough to accommodate the expression of the views driving the\nvarious agendas and allow for a continuous flow of opinions in all directions across\nthe organisation.\nThe openness within the organisation discourages dysfunctional internal conflict and\nhighlights potential issues\/threats earlier than they may have been revealed in a more\ncovert and resentful atmosphere.\nIt is not just a question of not overlooking the opinion of others, and this applies to all\nlevels, but indeed courting their positive and negative feedback. Even more than that,\nthe ability to accept constructive criticism without defensiveness is key in terms of\nensuring voluntary and well meant approach on a continual basis. This ensures that\nvaluable information reaches the top team to help them think more widely and to warn\nthem of potential threats in good time. Such information is already there within the\nranks of the company and an open and easy to access communication process\n19\n19\nprevents it staying at the water cooler or over the coffee cup in the kitchen where it\nwill do the company no good at all and indeed potentially harm it.\nKey to the achievement of such a positive feedback culture is a degree of openness\nand robustness of relationships among managers in the organisation (Kakabadse and\nKakabadse 1999). Patterns of behaviour which consistently promote good\ncommunication are important conduits towards getting the whole team to face in the\nsame direction and follow the vision. From management visibility on the floor to\nsocial get togethers, a pattern of events will glue the teams together and make them\nmore likely to work for the cause because they want to rather than because they have\nto. Once such activities are set in place each one and each member of staff validates\nthe next and a positive causal effect ensues, a commonality of vision may emerge\nwhich incorporates the differences and diversity in the team in a synergistic way.\nSuch commonality of vision and more is apparent when analysing the leadership\ntactics of General Patton (Axelrod, 1999). His leadership sprang from a shower of\nverbal ballistics which cleverly ended in motivating the receiver by allowing them to\nmake a vision of their own within the overall vision \u2013 thus giving each a personal\nstake in what is ahead. This is achieved with graphic references to the worst outcomes\non the battlefield, metaphor, anecdote and extremely aggressive and rude language\nbut then taking each individual to their dotage in front of a fireplace with their\ngrandson on their knee \u2013 asking what they did in the war. Thus visualising their own\nhomes, future and pride they each owned a part of the overall vision and commonality\nwas achieved.\n20\n20\nThis is further cemented when the listening ethos of Patton is outlined as an empathic\nand active one (Axelrod, 1999). General Patton promoted an open door policy for\ngood communication to promote good listening. He said \u201c If you cultivate an air of\nremoteness and unavailability, people will stop talking to you, and you will cheat\nyourself of the single most valuable commodity in any enterprise: information.\u201d\nEstablishing a visioning culture\nIn addition to establishing and continuing an overall culture of communication with\nfast feedback, the visioneer must nurture and maintain a supportive context in order to\nevolve a visioning culture proper. This, in direct partnership with the fast feedback\napproaches above, will involve drilling down into the various processes of the\ncompany and inspiring the teams at different levels. Understanding the work nearer\nthe frontline and encouraging feedback platforms will help release valuable opinion\nand knowledge which could be suffocated by a tighter less approachable hierarchy.\nAllowing an incorporation of influences and opinions into the visioning process from\ndifferent levels will add towards a shared vision. Then, this shared vision itself could\npotentially enhance the interaction between team members in its turn, irrespective of\nwhether or not a shared view for the future does actually emerge.\nThe overall cultural change will also need to be broken down into manageable parts.\nManageable milestones are crucial in ensuring as many of the team as possible work\ntogether towards an achievable goal and experience a positive view of change in the\nprocess so furnishing a further enthusiasm for the next stage and so on. As well as the\n21\n21\nevangelisation of the overall vision then, the visioneer must make \u2018sub-visions\u2019 as\nstepping stones towards it. Such staging highlights to the team their particular ability\nto do the task giving them greater confidence and they go in addition to creating\nnatural review periods where work can be reassessed to ensure it is further tailored for\nsuccess.\nWithin this a common language is cultivated and this cements the experience of the\npresent changes making them firmer in their influence in the foundation for the future.\nBy pivoting on the present and ensuring the experience is good, the visioneer may get\nmore from the team undergoing the changes in terms of new ideas and fresh\nmotivations. This home grown enthusiasm can then make the visioning voyage a self\nevangelising one. So, a non-linear use of time is the focus. By avoiding too much\nretrospective reflection, a wider exploration of new possibilities is possible and the\nincorporation of the whole team within this enriches the overall vision created.\nMany levels of sub-vision platform can be created on and under the overall vision\nplatform in order for the whole vision to succeed. They must relate closely to each\nother through stabilising elements. These then, consist of an environment which\nsupports their intertwining, an agreed common language from the top as well as then\nused throughout and a common and positive experience of change. The latter broken\ninto manageable stages into which the employee engages fully and goes to internally\nmarket the vision tactically at the heart of the company and this feeds back through to\nthe overall vision which is delivered more strategically.\n22\n22\nStrategic vision (Westley 1989) could be the starting point then for managing more\nand more complex companies more successfully. The process above can essentially\nbe broken down into three parts:\n1. Envisioning stage where the future is formed and an image\/idea of that is\ncreated and firmed up. There is a need to find a clear ideal for the future. In\nthe ideal future every person will be able to perceive a guiding value that has\nevoked the leader's decision. From this ideal, the notion of value must be then\nexpressed as a more concrete image or vision of the organisation, which can\nencourage people to realise that ideal. The ideal, on its own, within such a\nvision, is not powerful enough to arouse people to put their energy into action\ntowards it.\n2. Visioneering stage or Evangelising \u2013 where the message is effectively\narticulated and communicated to followers in the company. This stage also\ninvolves the selection of the final vision. It is best done in collaboration with\ncolleagues\/team in order to achieve maximum unity. It therefore requires high\nlevels of skill in moderation at all levels to gain the commitment of the senior\nteam for a united front and to handle resultant discussion and debate\nthroughout the company.\n3. Sub-visioning stage which serves to understand and empower the followers to\nenact the vision but also be part of it and work with manageable amounts of\nchange. This is the stage of reaching the final vision in a practical day-to-day\n23\n23\nway. Working with and holding democratic meetings with stakeholders (e.g.\nstaff, customers etc.) will help reach a final vision through a full and fair\ndialogue\/discussion. Breaking the overall goal into realistic shorter-term\ntargets which complement the chosen direction and motivate the teams to\nachieve the next stage is a crucial part of the process but very different from\nthe \u2018Short-termism\u2019 on the other side of the equation.\nThe parts can be chronologically applied or indeed used in different degrees at\ndifferent times to achieve maximum following and success. However used, they\nwould seem pivotal to the degree of success of the whole visioning process.\nFigure 2 shows how these fit into the positive side of the visioning process.\nFigure 2: Visioning\nSource: Compiled by the authors\nENVISIONING VISIONEERING SUBVISIONING\nPersonal\nConviction\nfor the\nCause\nCommit-\nment of the\nSenior\nteam\nFast\nFeedback\nEstablish-\nA\nVisioning\nCulture\nV I S I O N I N G\nVision\n24\n24\nSo, having a vision is different to visioning. Visioning is the action required to\nachieve the vision and is broken down into a number of essential components. These\ncan be used serially, simultaneously or pro rata necessitum. They are deliberate but\npositively so. In this case the envisioning, visioneering and subvisioning are a\ncommunication and enaction of the overall vision at different layers and levels\nresulting in and operating with the four steps forward given. As each of these four\nsteps work alongside each other too, it is also expected that they also all apply to\ndifferent degrees at the different layers within the hierarchy. These positive causal\nloops operate then with different specifics appropriate to their level but feed into each\nother in the same way and have the same overall direction and purpose.\nIn the visioning process leaders need to take into consideration and to examine five\ncomplex factors, namely sensations, internal verbalisations and visualisations,\nfeelings, values and interpersonal relations as they all consciously or sub-consciously\nimpact on the envisioning process and can limit or augment it accordingly. Each of\nthese comprises of number of variables (Nevis, 1987: 25):\n\uf0b7 Sensations: the outcomes of all the senses used to understand\n\uf0b7 Internal verbalisations and visualisations: from thinking to memories\n\uf0b7 Feelings: all manner of feelings at the time which may affect acceptance\n\uf0b7 Values: predispositions, the past and prejudices\n\uf0b7 Interpersonal and group relations: participation patterns and norms\n25\n25\nVisioning vs Divisioning: Leaders Choice or Lack of Insight?\nHaving travelled down the two pathways and examined the links between stages, the\nquestion arises as to where it all starts. Although the journey can be clear to see and\neven the stage of the journey a company has arrived at easy to plot on the two\npathways given, it is not clear exactly what decides the direction towards visioning or\ndivisioning in the first place. Does it come down to individual leadership choice or is\nit merely a lack of insight? ( Kakabadse and Kakabadse 1999).\nThe leader's philosophy (i.e. held views) may be important. Some leaders do not\nbelieve in the softer people skills or \"fluffy\" stuff of parts of the visioning process and\nhow that feeds into long term profit.\nThey may believe that coercion is more effective and that autocratic example is truly\nthe way forward. They may even have no option in order to keep their own job safe.\nEither way, they make a definite choice.\nIt could merely come down to the ability of the leader and their lack of insight (i.e.\nlack of imagination) - some simply do not know how to or cannot do it. They may not\neven be aware of it themselves.\nAlso, one should not overlook the effects of an entrenched culture within (i.e. a\ntraditional culture that is difficult to change). Embedded views can occur at any level\nand present the leader with limitations.\n26\n26\nIt could be said that, whether deliberate or not, a choice is actually made and that that\nchoice dictates the direction of the company towards the vision or towards division. It\nis decided then to call the central pivot of the visioning pathway \u2013 leader\u2019s choice \u2013\nhowever it came about.\nThe Visioning Process Model shown in Figure 3 illustrates the key elements of\nsuccessful visioning while at the same time outlining the consequences of their\nabsence or vision vulnerability (Kakabadse 1991) and the subsequent \u2018Divisioning\u2019.\n27\n27\nFigure 3: The Visioning Process Model (or Visioning Pathway)\nSource: Compiled by the authors\nENVISIONING VISIONEERING SUBVISIONING\nPersonal\nConviction\nfor the\nCause\nCommit-\nment of the\nSenior\nteam\nFast\nFeedback\nEstablish-\nA\nVisioning\nCulture\nV I S I O N I N G\nLeader's Choice\nNONVISIONING DIVISIONEERING SUBDIVISIONING\nOrganisat-\nIonal\nDivision\nParadox\nIn\nEmpower-\nment\nInternal\nWar\nShort\nTermism\nD I V I S I O N I N G\n28\n28\nConclusion\nSo the choice of the leader, whether deliberate or otherwise, has a direct bearing on\nthe overall success of the company in terms of visioning. It is at this central point that\nthe degree of cohesiveness of the company is decided for the future.\nFollow the pathway forwards by incorporating the steps illustrated and teams at the\nvarious layers are more likely to stick together and work for the overall purpose and\ndirection. It is also likely that as this bond is made by the correct visioning course, it\nadopts a self-perpetuating adhesiveness with more people more likely to buy into the\noverall cause from the positive example they see. This could be especially attractive\nto the newly recruited who buy into the vision from the start.\nFollow the pathway backwards, even accidently, and any existing cohesiveness\ndeteriorates. Teams become more survivalist in nature and look less and less far ahead\nand work less and less for the company and more for themselves. Energies are turned\ninwards on internal competition and dispute rather than outwards for the benefit of the\nwhole company in its competitive market. There is not one direction and purpose but\nmany, not one main agenda but many and perhaps hidden at that. In addition to\nincreasing the turnover of existing staff this could be especially unattractive to the\nnewly recruited who find the division within the company too much to bear. High\nstaff turnover rates then cause cyclical problems themselves for the business and\nexacerbate the problem.\nAside from viewing the possibilities with a vertical eye on the Visioning Process\nModel, it would be useful to apply it three dimensionally to the many layers within\n29\n29\nany organisation. The pivotal leader\u2019s choice may not always be that of the overall\nleader and how the leaders through the layers act can have the same bearings as above\nand perhaps undo any good visioning work carried out at higher levels. This could\nequally apply the other way round. Therefore, the visioning or divisioning pathway\nmay be visible many times over within the hierarchy.\nIn addition to the internal influences on the visioning process it is also accepted that\nmany external influences will affect leader\u2019s choice. This paper has not set out to\nexplore those but recognises that constant change makes any visioning diagnosis an\nongoing requirement in order for the company to assess its competitive worthiness.\nVisioning relies on setting up for and encouraging ongoing synergy as part of\norganisational culture. The traditional concept of organisational vision was\nrepresented with two distinct concepts; as an approach to vision driven business\nstrategy or as an approach to vision driven organisational culture (McGivern 1998).\nThe Visioning Process Model helps identify that vision driven organisational culture\nor successful visioning precedes and is key to strategic development.\n30\n30\nReferences\nAxelrod A.
