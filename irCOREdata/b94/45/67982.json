There are a wide variety of circumstances in which we \nare required to carry out mental operations and remember intermediate \ninformation (for instance, retain a carry item in mental arithmetic or a referent for \nan anaphoric pronoun) or draw on past episodic knowledge (e.g., mapping the \nproblem space for a current task using knowledge of related situations). They \nemphasise the importance of understanding active maintenance and \ntransformation processes. Consequently, the concept of working memory has been \nthe focus of considerable research. \nThe most common method for assessing working memory capacity is to \ndraw upon at least one of a family of tasks known as working memory (WM) span. \nReading span was the first such task to be reported in adults (Daneman & \nCarpenter, 1980). Participants read a series of unconnected sentences, the final \nword in each sentence yielding a memorandum to be reported afterwards in serial \norder. In essence, an individual\u2019s reading span score reflects how many end-of-\nsentence words can be remembered whilst reading. Daneman and Carpenter \n(1980) showed reading span to be a very good measure of reading skill (see also \nDaneman & Merikle, 1986). The predictive prowess of WM span tasks (including \nalternatives such as operation span where the processing task involves arithmetic \n 4 \noperations, Turner & Engle, 1989) provides empirical support for the conceptual \nidea that the processing-plus-memory requirements tap an important skill in \ncomplex cognition.  \nSeveral theories suggest, in different ways and to different degrees, that a \ncompetitive relationship between processing and memory activities is critical to \nmeasuring WM capacity (see Miyake & Shah, 1999). In other words, the suggestion \nis that the maintenance of information takes place in the face of distraction or \ninterference from concurrent processing. For example, Case (1985) proposed that \nlimited-capacity general-purpose cognitive resources were allocated to either \nprocessing or memory demands. Jarrold and Bayliss (2007) discuss evidence that \ncombining or coordinating processing with memory places demands on WM, above \nand beyond those imposed by each requirement per se. Towse, Hitch and Hutton \n(1998) argued that processing activity produces informational degradation because \nmemories are not actively or continuously maintained (in this respect, see also \nBarrouillet, Bernadin, & Camos, 2004). Kane and Engle (2003) suggested that \ncontrolled attention is required to preserve memory representations at the same \ntime as the concurrent processing requirements. \nWe can see important insights to be gained from each of these accounts, and \nwe do not intend to arbitrate between them here. Rather, our focus is directed \ntowards the concept that links them; the idea that processing and memory are \nseparable and place competing demands on WM. We certainly accept that \nprocessing can interfere with retention. Nonetheless, we present data that lead us \nto conclude that this is not the whole story; processing may also complement or \n 5 \nsupport memory (for an early and seminal version of this perspective, see Craik & \nLockhart, 1972).  \nOur core proposal is that processing and memory need not always be \nthought of as completely separate. Using behavioural and chronometric evidence, \nwe propose that psychological models can be enhanced by encompassing a broader \nview of the nature of WM representations present at the point of recall.  \nChronometric analyses of memory recall \u2013 the timing of correct output \nsequences \u2013 has generally focused on short-term memory (STM) tasks such as \nword span where a sequence of unrelated items is presented at a regular rate and \nthen reproduced in the original order (e.g., Dosher & Ma, 1998; for an overview, \nTowse & Cowan, 2005). Whilst such research has been undoubtedly productive, \ngiven the body of evidence to distinguish STM from WM (e.g., Daneman & \nCarpenter, 1980; Engle, Kane & Tuholski, 1999), there is a clear motivation to \ninvestigate recall timing in WM. Cowan et al. (2003) did just this. They found \nchildren\u2019s reading span recall times were dramatically longer than has been \nobtained in STM studies, and that for both children and adults (but especially the \nformer) response durations for listening span exceeded those of counting span and \ndigit span. Cowan et al. also reported a negative correlation between recall duration \nand children\u2019s word reading skills; moreover recall duration explained variance \nover and above that from span scores per se: recall evidently incorporates processes \nrelevant to children\u2019s cognitive development and attainment. \nThe particularly long interword pauses in reading span and listening span \nled Cowan et al. (2003) to two related conclusions. First, memory representations \nmay not always be maintained in a highly accessible state during processing. If they \n 6 \nhad been, one would expect their rapid production during recall. Second, \nparticipants sometimes draw on memory of the sentence, in terms of thematic and \nsemantic context, to access the target items. Cowan et al. found that recall in \ncounting span was less protracted than listening span, and attributed this to the \nlack of distinctive processing in the enumeration of visual displays, and thus the \nabsence of a similar scaffolding process. Thus, reading span and listening span \nrecall can involve the consideration of a much richer ensemble of (perhaps loosely \nencoded) memories of the trial episode than is the case for other tasks.  \nTo capture these ideas we propose a \u2018recall reconstruction\u2019 hypothesis for \nWM performance. The central idea is that participants may bring to recall more \nthan just representations of experimentally-assigned memoranda (i.e. target \nmemory words). In the specific case of reading span, this can involve for example \nsentential information. As a consequence, we argue that the memory sequence may \nnot be continuously and actively maintained and consequently recall involves the \nresuscitation of degraded information. \nAccording to this recall reconstruction perspective, WM potentially involves \nthe intertwined and integrated aspects of processing and memory. Processing and \nmemory activities need not inherently be in complete opposition to each other, \ndependent on the specific WM task. Consider an example sentence from Daneman \nand Carpenter (1980): \u201cThe lumbermen worked long hours in order to obtain the \nnecessary amount of wood.\u201d According to the position just outlined, later recall of \n\u201cwood\u201d might be facilitated by gist or episodic memory about lumbermen, or \nindeed associations made during reading to the implicit concept \u201ctrees\u201d. An \nindividual need not commit a sentence to memory verbatim, but relevant linguistic \n 7 \ninformation could nonetheless be accessible, either to help reconstruct the word \n\u201cwood\u201d or to discount sentence-terminal words appropriate to other serial \npositions. In a similar vein, Saito & Miyake (2004) have pointed to a relationship \nbetween processing activity and memory within their representation-based \ninterference account of WM. While they concentrated on how processing events \ncan hinder memory, via overlapping representations that interfere, their position is \nalso that the content of processing affects memory performance. \nSo far as we are aware, no studies have directly investigated the link between \nprocessing meaning and memory requirements in WM. However, Osaka, Nishizaki, \nKomori & Osaka (2002) studied reading span, and for language-specific reasons \nunderlined the word that was to be remembered. This was either a \u201cfocus\u201d word \u2013\nthe most important word for sentence meaning- or a less-central \u201cnon-focus\u201d word. \nRecall was substantially and significantly better for focus words. While all their \nmemoranda were thematically connected with sentence material, their data \nsupport a link between processing material and what is remembered.  \nOther indirect evidence is relevant to this issue. Copeland & Radvansky \n(2001) reported a reversed phonemic similarity effect in reading span, but a \nstandard effect for operation span, concluding that phonemically similar lists were \nat an advantage because recall was facilitated by the sentence context. Hitch, Towse \n& Hutton (2001: Fig. 2) reported that among children, the rate of forgetting on an \noperation span task (as a function of arithmetic processing time) was faster than \nthe rate of forgetting on a reading span task (as a function of sentence processing \ntime). Distinctive sentences may help to retard forgetting because they can be used \nin the reconstruction of target memoranda, in a way that less distinct arithmetic \n 8 \nproblems cannot. However, Conlin, Gathercole & Adams (2005) argued against \nreconstructive processes in WM because they found superior recall of memoranda \nwhen categorically distinct from processing (e.g. remembering numbers after \nreading sentences, or remembering words after mental arithmetic).  Yet this \nconfounds categorical similarity of material with opportunity for scaffolding. \nIn a series of experiments, we test the recall reconstruction hypothesis \ndirectly. Its validity is important because it addresses the widespread assumption \nthat processing and memory are necessarily competitive components of WM tasks. \nYet it also broadens the conceptual focus, encouraging theoretical models of WM to \nincorporate recall and not just maintenance processes (Unsworth & Engle, 2006). \nWe therefore attempt to replicate the long interword pauses found in reading span \nby Cowan et al. (2003) and test accounts of what underlies this phenomenon. We \nfocus on interword pauses because it is here specifically that participants engage in \nmental search processes to access the next sequence item, and because other recall \nsegments such as preparatory intervals have dissociable patterns of performance \n(Cowan et al., 1998; Towse & Cowan, 2005). The experiments substantially extend \nthe analysis of Cowan et al. by providing converging paradigms to investigate recall \ntiming, using spoken recall as well as non-spoken responses. This latter approach \nopens up new opportunities for studying the chronometry of recall and the nature \nof memory representations. \nExperiment 1 \nTo examine why reading span performance is characterised by long response \ndurations, we manipulated the relevance of sentential processing for the memory \nitems, based on the reading task structure used by Cowan et al. (2003), Expt. 1 (see \n 9 \nalso Towse, Hitch & Hutton, 2000) and for comparison we also included a STM \ntask. On a reading span trial a participant might read the unfinished sentence \u201cThe \nrocket went into outer ___\u201d and we would expect them to suggest \u201cspace\u201d as the \ncompletion word. The memorandum could be (a) \u201cspace, and thus connected or \n\u2018integrated\u2019 with processing or (b) \u201cbridge\u201d, and thus unrelated to or \u2018independent\u2019 \nof processing. Since the condition a) word is integrated within the sentence, \nparticipants can use sentence representations (e.g., knowledge that it referred to a \nrocket) to inform their recall choice although drawing upon this additional \ninformation will slow down recall. This is not possible with condition b) which \nshould therefore be recalled more quickly since participants must use alternative \u2013 \nalbeit potentially effective \u2013 maintenance processes for the sequence of items.  \nMethod \nParticipants \nTwenty-four Lancaster University students (22 women and 2 men) \nvolunteered via departmental recruitment procedures and were paid \u00a33. They were \nrandomly assigned to the integrated and independent condition, as described \nbelow. \nStimuli  \nA corpus of 88 sentences (based on medium-length stimuli described in \nTowse, Hamilton, Hitch & Hutton, 2000) were randomly divided into two sets, \u201cset \nA\u201d and \u201cset B\u201d. Allocation of sentence sets to participants was randomised with the \nalternative end-of-sentence items used for word span stimuli. Sentences typically \ncontained 8-10 words and had been formulated to elicit target completion words \n 10 \nwith a high probability among children (for example, \"While I was sleeping I had a \nstrange\" typically leads to the completion response \"dream\"). \nApparatus \nComputer events were driven by an Apple Macintosh ibook G4 with 14 inch \nscreen (programmed using the \u201cRevolution\u201d language running under OS X) with \nresponse latencies measured in (1\/60 s) ticks. Audio recordings were captured \ndirectly to minidisk (Sony MZ-N710, with a Sony ECM-DS70P microphone). \nProcedure \nFollowing task instructions, all participants undertook a STM (word span) \ntest, and either the integrated or independent word WM (reading span) test in \ncounterbalanced order.  \nReading span trials. On each trial, a set of (between 2 and 5) incomplete \nsentences appeared sequentially on screen. Participants read each sentence aloud \nand generated a suitable completion word. Afterwards, they attempted serial recall \nof the memoranda. Trials commenced with 3 sets of 2 sentences. Provided at least \none memory sequence was recalled correctly, an additional sentence was added to \nthe series and 3 further trials were administered, up the maximum 5-sentence sets. \nParticipants knew the list length prior to each trial. \nIn the integrated word condition, the sentence completion words formed the \nmemoranda (if a non-expected response was produced, this was adopted as the \nmemory target). Once the participant completed the sentence, the experimenter \nimmediately tapped a computer key to initiate the next sentence or the recall cue, \nwhich occurred after a 1 second interval. Participants were instructed not to \nrehearse words whilst reading and to begin reading each sentence immediately.  \n 11 \nIn the independent word condition, participants also supplied a completion \nword for each sentence. This was followed by a separate, unconnected word to be \nread aloud, which formed the memorandum. This appeared for .5 sec surrounded \nby .25 sec ISIs. These timing parameters ensured the independent and integrated \nconditions were equivalent in overall duration. The independent words for \u201cset A\u201d \nwere taken from the \u201cset B\u201d pool, and vice versa.  \nWord span trials. Participants watched the visual presentation of a \nsequence of unconnected words. Each word was shown centre-screen for 0.5 sec, \nwith a 0.5 sec ISI. Initially there were 3 trials containing 2 memoranda, and \nsequence length increased by a single item, provided that at least one trial was \nsuccessfully recalled, up to a maximum list length of 5 words. \nRecall \nInstructions asked participants to recall the word sequence to a trial as soon \nas (but not before) the computer produced an auditory-visual recall signal. \nParticipants were asked to limit their spoken response to the recall words only (to \navoid other words such as \u201cI think\u201d, \u201cthen it was\u201d or \u201cand\u201d) and were reminded if \nnecessary during test administration. The experimenter recorded answers onto \ncomputer after the output sequence was complete. \nResults \nWe examined the effect of task administration order (whether word span or \nreading span was administered first, for each stimulus pool set and task \nconfiguration) and found no significant effects on global timing measurements. We \ntherefore collapse across order in subsequent analyses. \n 12 \nSentence reading times for the integrated word and independent word \nformats (M=3.39, SD=.31 and M=3.29, SD=.64 respectively) were equivalent, \nt(22)=.47, p=.647, !2=.009. Following recommendations by Conway et al. (2005), \nand Friedman and Miyake (2004a) accuracy is measured in terms of correctly \nrecalled words (with respect to item and position). These are shown in Table 1, \nexpressed as a proportion of the maximum attainable. Analysis confirmed memory \naccuracy was substantially greater for integrated words compared to independent \nwords, t(22)=5.01, p<.001, !2=.5331. \nRecall times were extracted only from those trials where serially ordered \nitems were fully correct. In some cases, data were excluded because the participant \nrestarted their list (e.g. \u201cyellow\u2026 dream\u2026. no, wait, door\u2026yellow\u2026dream\u201d) or in \nsome way gave an ambiguous report with respect to timing issues.  \nSpoken recall was segmented into three contiguous phases (see, for example, \nCowan et al., 1998); the time between the recall signal and the start of recall (the \npreparatory interval); the time to articulate the relevant words (each word \nduration), and the gaps between words (interword pauses). A single trained \nresearcher extracted timing values, for whom blind timings both correlate and \ncorrespond with those made by an independent coder (for a sample of 99 word and \ninterval measurements, r(97)=.993). Specific recall time segments were screened \nfor outliers by examining z-score distributions of each time measurement; where \nz>2.58, that interval duration was excluded. Measures of stability are reported in \nTable 2. To make analysis easier to present, we focus on the three recall phases, \n                                                \n1 Where appropriate as here, probabilities have been corrected after adjusting degrees of \nfreedom because of non-equal variances. In the case of analysis of variance, we report \nGreenhouse-Geisser values where warranted. \n 13 \ncombining individual values (e.g., the first and second word in two-item \nsequences). \nFigure 1 shows the profile of recall durations. At list length 2, the mean \npause between integrated words was longer than that between independent words, \nalthough this difference was only marginally significant, t(22)=2.00, p=.058, \n!2=.154. At list length 3, the effect was in the same direction, but not significant, \nt(14)=.57, p=.580, !2=.023, while at list length 4 there were too few data points in \nthe independent condition for analysis. Combining data across list length 2 and 3, \npauses in the integrated word condition were twice the length of the independent \nword condition, t(22)=2.13, p=.045, !2=.171.  \nPreparatory intervals and word durations were similar between integrated \nand independent words and comparisons at list length 2 and 3 were non significant \n(ts<1.36, ps>.187, !2<.078). This dissociation in sensitivity is consistent with the \nnotion that the separate recall segments can be differentiated (Cowan et al., 1998). \nWe carried out additional analysis on STM recall, but since these are less relevant \nto the main experimental issue, they are reported in Appendix 1. \nDiscussion \nCowan et al. (2003) emphasised differences between STM and WM recall \nwith respect to pause length in particular. Furthermore, the longer recall was most \nevident for WM tasks that involved linguistic-based processing. The recall \nreconstruction hypothesis explains this finding by proposing that the specification \nof a target item might include consideration of representations persisting from the \nsentences, and this takes time. \n 14 \nThe present study experimentally evaluated this hypothesis by manipulating \nthe link between sentential processing and memory items. When processing events \ncan scaffold recall, pauses should be extended as a richer set of representations are \nevaluated. Indeed, gaps between words were longer when processing and memory \nwere linked and more sequences were correctly recalled.  \nAll other things being equal one might expect that a difference in memory \naccuracy would work against the obtained recall time difference since accessing the \ncorrect item should be more difficult with weaker memory representations. The \nmore rapid correct recall in the independent condition is therefore all the more \ntelling. That this effect was not also obtained for the preparatory intervals \nemphasises how this recall segment has dissociable properties, and likely involves a \nnumber of processes that are not specifically tied to the production of the first item. \nTo forestall possible mis-interpretation, we do not suggest that the \nprocessing event in reading span provides only a supportive environment for recall. \nMemory for the sentence ideas, or sentence words, may well degrade access to the \ndesignated memory item, offering alternative recall candidates and adding to the \nproblem of discriminating between memoranda and activated non target \nrepresentations (Conlin et al. 2005; Saito & Miyake, 2004; see also below). Our \nargument is that the elicitation of recall words can be affected by memory for the \nprocessing material, and that this emergent property of the way reading span trials \nare often constructed is one contributory factor to the protracted recall of items \nreported here and elsewhere (Cowan et al., 2003). \nExperiment 2 \n 15 \nExperiment 1 asked participants to read aloud an incomplete sentence and \nformulate a (constrained and thus predictable) completion word. This processing \nrequirement has been used among adults and children (e.g. Leather & Henry, 1994; \nTowse et al., 1998; 2000) and helps to ensure that participants attend to the \nsentences. At the same time, we note that the integrated condition involves \nmemory for a self-generated item, while the independent condition involves \nmemory for a different item that follows the self-generated word. \n Slamecka and Graf (1978) demonstrated a recall accuracy advantage for \nself-generated items in comparison with read items although subsequent work has \nsuggested a dissociation between (positive) item and (negative) order effects in \nself-generation (Nairne, Riegler & Serra, 1991). One recent account is that \ngeneration encourages semantic processing of material and context (Mulligan, \n2004; see also Steffens & Erdfelder, 1998). In this sense, generation could affect \nreading span recall by elaborating and enriching the memory representation, \nsimilar to the time-consuming recall reconstruction processes envisaged here. \nNotwithstanding this overlap, to understand better the locus of the accuracy and \ninterword pause effects, we removed the generation requirements from the reading \nspan task in the next study. \nMethod \nParticipants \nTwenty-eight Lancaster University students (22 women and 6 men) were \npaid \u00a33 to complete reading span trials and ancillary tasks (not described here). \nThey were randomly assigned to the integrated and independent condition. \n 16 \nStimuli and Apparatus \nWe used the same apparatus and sentences as in Experiment 1 except that \nthe latter were presented in completed form; there were no missing words. \nProcedure \nParticipants completed either the (a) integrated or (b) independent word \ntask. (a) Each sentence appeared in black type with the final word in purple - to \ndemarcate that it was a to-be-remembered item. There was a 1-sec ISI. (b) Each \n(completed) sentence appeared entirely in black type. The purple memory word \nappeared for .5 sec (surrounded by .25 sec ISIs). Timing parameters were again \ndesigned to equate durations across task format. Instructions were the same except \nthat rather than furnishing a sentence completion, participants were instructed to \n\u201cread the sentences aloud and think about the sentence meaning as you do so.\u201d \nResults \nSentence reading times for integrated and independent conditions (M=2.95, \nSD=.50 and M=2.84, SD=.33 respectively) were equivalent, t(26)=.71, p=.488, \n!2=.019, and just slightly quicker than in Experiment 1 (sampling differences and \nthe absence of sentence completion requirements could explain the discrepancy). \nIn terms of the proportion of correctly recalled words, shown in Table 1, the \nintegrated format enjoyed an advantage, but in this dataset it was not significant, \nt(26)=1.46, p=.156, !2=.076. Notably, the major difference from Experiment 1 is \nthat without the generation requirements, performance in the independent \ncondition has improved. \n 17 \nAs in Experiment 1, recall time outliers were screened prior to compilation \nof trial data2. Recall times are illustrated in Figure 2 (Table 2 reports stability \nmeasures). At list length 2, the pauses between integrated words were significantly \nlonger than between independent words, t(26)=2.24, p=.034, !2=.162. The average \nlist length 3 pause was also significantly longer in the integrated condition, \nt(24)=2.54, p=.020, !2=.212, and the pause difference averaged across list lengths \n2 and 3 was likewise significant, t(26)=3.08, p=.005, !2=.267. Word duration \ndifferences at list length 2 were in the same direction as above but only marginally \nsignificant, t(26)=1.96, p=.061, !2=.129, while there was no reliable difference in \nfor list length 3, t(24)=.22, p=.828, !2=.002. There were no differences in \npreparatory intervals (e.g. averaged across both list lengths, t(26)=.32, p=.751, \n!2=.004). At list length 4 there were few data points for meaningful analysis. \nDiscussion \nThe data offer further support for the recall reconstruction hypothesis. We \nagain found evidence that interword pauses in recall are longer when there is a \nconnection between the memoranda and the processing context associated with \nthem. There was also a trend for superior levels of recall in the integrated condition \nbut this was not significant in the current dataset. \nThus, word generation per se cannot be wholly responsible for slow but \naccurate recall in the integrated condition (see Conlin et al., 2005, for additional \nevidence of phenomena robust across generation effects). The clear point of change \nacross experiments lies in recall from the independent condition. Generating a \n                                                \n2 Two independent judges extracted timing measurements, using the same \nprocedures as Expt. 1. Independent t-tests on all list-length 2 and list-length 3 \nsegments indicated comparable judgements between coders (all ps>.10) \n 18 \nword to complete a sentence (Experiment 1), as opposed to just reading a sentence \n(Experiment 2), makes it harder to then recall a separate word that follows. This \ncould be because in the independent condition the generated - irrelevant word - \naffects the encoding of the subsequent item or maintenance of items already \nencoded (this is investigated further in Experiment 4 below). Regardless, data \ndemonstrate that longer interword pauses in recall are due to the processing-\nmemory connection, not the processing task per se.  \nExperiment 3 \nBoth previous experiments show that participants take reliably longer to \nrecall words semantically linked to the sentences they accompany. However, the \naccuracy advantage for integrated words was significant only in Experiment 1. \nTherefore, we collected data from an additional experiment comparing reading \nspan for integrated and independent words. This allows us to replicate the recall \ntiming effect and assess further the issue of recall accuracy. The number of trials at \neach sequence length was also larger and used a different corpus of sentences. \nMethod \nParticipants \nThirty-three Lancaster University students (27 women and 6 men) formed a \nsubset of a larger experiment. They were paid \u00a34 to complete the reading span \ntrials and additional tasks (not described here), and were randomly assigned to the \nintegrated and independent condition. \nApparatus and Procedure \nThe same apparatus as in Experiment 2 was employed. The core stimulus \npool comprised 90 sentences from the Friedman & Miyake (2004b) corpus. This \n 19 \nwas divided into two subsets (A & B) as before. Participants completed either the \n(a) integrated or (b) independent reading span task. (a) Each sentence appeared in \nblack type with the final to-be-remembered word (integrated with sentence \nmeaning) displayed in purple. There was a 0.5 sec ISI. (b) The entire sentence \nappeared in black type with the independent memory word that followed it shown \nin purple type for 0.5 sec. Participants were administered a total of 15 trials; 5 for \neach list length 2-4, in ascending sequence length order. Verbal instructions were \nthe same as Experiment 2. \nResults \nSentence reading times for integrated and independent conditions (M=5.22, \nSD=.69 and M=4.86, SD=.56 respectively) did not differ significantly, t(29)=1.58, \np=.125, !2=.079. The sentences were longer than those used in previous \nexperiments, leading to extended reading times, but the pattern of performance is \nthe same. In terms of the number of correctly recalled words, shown in Table 1, the \nintegrated format again enjoyed an advantage, but in this dataset it was not \nsignificant, t(31)=1.82, p=.078, !2=.097.  \nTo increase statistical power we combined accuracy scores with data from \nExperiment 2. The trial structure changed across experiment with more shorter \nsequence length trials in Experiment 3, and indeed the proportion of words \ncorrectly recalled was higher in Experiment 3, F(1,57)=13.4, p=.001, !p2=.191. \nNonetheless it is the difference between sentence formats that is relevant here, and \nindeed more words were recalled from the integrated format, F(1,57)=5.13, p=.027, \n!p2=.083. There was no interaction between experiment and task format, F<1, \np=.747, !p2=.002. Thus, the integrated format does lead to greater levels of recall, \n 20 \neven without a word generation requirement in processing, though the effect is \nsignificant only with data aggregated across the two studies. \nOne judge (who contributed to measurements in Experiment 2) extracted \ntiming measurements from auditory recordings of correct reading span sequence, \nand outliers were screened as before. Recall times are illustrated in Figure 3. At list \nlength 2, the pauses between integrated words were significantly longer than \nbetween independent words, t(31)=2.88, p=.010, !2=.211. Moreover, the word \nduration was significantly longer in the integrated condition, t(31)=2.65, p=.012, \n!2=.185. At list length 3, the pause was also significantly longer in the integrated \ncondition, t(24)=2.37, p=.029, !2=.190 while the word durations did not differ, \nt(24)=.079, p=.938, !2<.001. The difference in the interword pause averaged \nacross list lengths 2 and 3 was significant, t(24)=2.68, p=.017, !2=.230. \nPreparatory intervals did not differ between the independent and integrated \nconditions at list length 2, t(31)=.81, p=.425, !2=.021, but were longer in the \nindependent condition for list length 3, t(24)=2.19, p=.038, !2=.167. Although \nparticipants were asked to read aloud the independent word immediately, some \nnonetheless articulated this item whilst the recall cue occurred, and consequently \ntheir \u2018preparatory interval\u2019 included additional reading. When we adjusted for the \n\u2018over-running\u2019 of the read word, the silent preparatory interval for the independent \ncondition became shorter than for the integrated condition at list length 2 (Ms=.46 \nvs. .82), t(31)=4.21, p<.001, !2=.364, and there was no longer any difference at list \nlength 3 (Ms=.88 vs. .96), t(24)=.44, p=.664, !2=.008. \nDiscussion \n 21 \nThis study confirms and extends the results from Experiments 1 and 2. We \nagain found that participants produced consistently longer pauses between recall \nwords when these words were semantically related to the sentences that had been \nread, compared to when the words were unrelated to the sentences preceding them. \nThe difference in recall accuracy between the integrated and independent \nconditions was clearly largest in Experiment 1. Recall accuracy was roughly \ncomparable in the integrated condition, regardless of whether participants either \ngenerated a sentence completion and final word. However, accuracy was relatively \npoor in Experiment 1 when participants generated a word to complete the sentence \nand then remembered a separate item, rather than when they read an entire \nsentence and remembered a separate item in Experiments 2 & 3. We conclude that \nthe memory for the independent words must be fragile, and thus retention can be \ndisrupted by competing representations such as a generated item. Yet this \nreinforces a central contention of the present paper: in reading span, participants \narrive at recall with more than just the experimentally-defined memoranda in mind \n(in this case, a generated word not relevant to the memory set). \u2018Processing\u2019 and \n\u2018memory\u2019 may represent separate experimentally-defined phases of the working \nmemory span trial, but memory is not a neatly segregated modular activity. \nExperiment 4 \nWe next undertook a conceptual replication of the preceding studies but \nrather than using spoken output, participants compiled a response sequence from a \nvisually-presented set of choices with a touch-screen device. Such an automated \nresponse method in which the computer measures inter-response delays offers a \npotentially complementary source of evidence about recall timing, avoiding the \n 22 \nrequirement that participants assemble words into articulatory programs (see \nChuah & Maybery, 1999; Maybery, Parmentier & Jones, 2002, for timing data \ninvolving spatial stimuli).  \nParticipants are shown a number of candidate words and they attempt to \nselect the designated memoranda in the correct serial order, whilst avoiding \nincorrect words, yielding a set of inter-response intervals rather than separate word \nand pause times. There were two types of incorrect lures; (a) words from the \nprocessing sentence, since it is known that participants sometimes verbally recall \nnontarget sentence material (Chiappe, Hasher & Segal, 2000; Friedman & Miyake, \n2004b); (b) Target words from the preceding trial. Thus, the participant must \novercome the impact of proactive interference from earlier trials (Lustig, Hasher & \nMay, 2001), or at least make source-information judgements about current and \npast memories (Hedden & Park, 2003).  \nThe experimental procedure returns to the \u2018read-and-complete\u2019 sentence \nprocessing procedure used in Experiment 1. However, the response format differs \nin a crucial respect. The recall choice display comprises correct answers, sentence \nwords and previous trial words. Thus, for the independent condition the self-\ngenerated sentence terminal word is not presented. The contrast between \nExperiment 1 and 2\/3 shows that this nontarget word impairs the accuracy of recall \nin the independent word condition. Consequently, this experiment offers an \nilluminating complement to and extension of the preceding studies. It addresses \nthe question of whether the generated item disrupts recall even when it is not \navailable as a response choice. \n 23 \nParticipants were administered two assessments of reading span. Responses \neither disappeared from the recall screen when they were selected or remained on \nscreen. This manipulation addresses the contribution of visual screen and search \ncomplexity to recall performance. Recall word repetition is unusual in spoken recall \nsequences, and hence removing selected answers allows participants to focus on \nremaining answers. However, this affects screen complexity \u2013 and potentially \nresponse selection time - as recall proceeds. Therefore a condition in which \nanswers remain available provides an important comparison. \n \nMethod \nParticipants \nTwenty-seven University of Missouri students (16 women and 11 men) \nparticipated for partial fulfilment of course credit requirements. One participant \nwas subsequently excluded since they consciously ignored serial recall instructions. \nStimuli and Apparatus \nComputer events were driven by an Apple Macintosh ibook (using \n\u201cRevolution\u201d software under OS X) with response latencies measured in (1\/60 s) \nticks. A Liyama touchscreen monitor (model INTH380-BS plus Keyspan RS232-\nUSB Adaptor) displayed the experimental screen and recorded participants\u2019 \nresponses. Some sentences were adjusted for idiomatic phrases since we sampled \nfrom North American participants (whereas English students are familiar with \neating \u201cfish and chips\u201d, American students are more familiar with a reference to \n\u201chamburger and fries\u201d). We added to the set of memory word stimuli such that \nmemoranda could be selected without replacement.  \n 24 \nProcedure \nExcept in the following respects, the procedure for the delivery of processing \nand memory followed Experiment 1. Trials at all list lengths (i.e. 2 \u2013 5) were \nadministered Independent memoranda were presented for .75 sec with .125 sec \nISIs (maintaining duration equivalence with integrated words). If a participant \nproduced a non-expected completion (suggesting \u201cFood and water makes plants\u201d \n\u2026\u201clive\u201d instead of \u201cgrow\u201d) the experimenter would identify the target word (say \u201cor \ngrow\u201d) before proceeding to the next experimental event3. Participants completed \nboth a \u2018remain\u2019 and \u2018disappear\u2019 response selection condition, which were presented \nin counterbalanced order, with a minimal break between each.  \nRecall \nUpon completion of the sentence processing phase, the computer presented \na response choice screen that comprised the target memoranda as well as incorrect \nwords. For each correct choice, there was also a \u2018processing-phase\u2019 lure \u2013 a word \nsharing semantic content that had appeared in the sentence (or very occasionally, \nwhen no suitable candidate was available, an associated prime word). There were \nalso two \u2018protrusion\u2019 lures \u2013 correct answers from the previous trial (the first trial \nemployed two randomly selected words). Each of these ((list length * 2) + 2) \ncandidate answers was assigned at random to one of 16 pre-specified screen \nlocations (arranged in an underlying pattern of four rows and columns). \nParticipants selected their responses by tapping the relevant locations on-screen in \nthe appropriate order. The computer recorded recall selections and latencies.  \n                                                \n3 This was necessary because recall items here were fixed prior to presentation, \nalthough it was used very rarely. \n 25 \nIn the \u2018disappear\u2019 condition, the chosen response was removed from the \nscreen upon selection. In the \u2018remain\u2019 condition, responses continued to be visible \nafter they had been chosen. In either case there was an auditory signal to confirm \nthe computer\u2019s registration of the response selection. Participants were informed \nabout the recall configuration at the start of the condition. \nResults \nInspection of Table 1 indicates that participants again recalled more \nintegrated words correctly (in both the disappear and remain condition) than \nindependent words. Analysis of variance confirmed a significant memory \nadvantage for integrated words, F(1,24)=16.2, p=.001, !p2=.402, but no difference \nbetween the screen formats, F<1, !p2<.001, and no interaction, F<1, !p2=.004. \nWe did not anticipate reading time differences between the disappear and \nremain condition, since they differ only in screen dynamics, and they were \ncomparable (M=3.50 vs. M=3.60 respectively), t(25)=.75, !2=.022.   There were \nalso no reliable reading time differences for integrated and independent words, for \neither the disappear or remain conditions (ts(24)<.97, !2<.038).  \nSelection times for correct sequences were screened for outliers as \npreviously.  Figure 4 describes pauses for each list length and response format. \nGraphs indicate list position effects \u2013 a speeding up in selection through the list \u2013 \nin both the disappear and remain conditions. Analysis revealed significantly \nquicker selections in the disappear condition at list length 3 only and no \ninteractions. We therefore simplify results by collapsing across this variable. \nThe average inter-item response durations for each list length were broadly \nconsistent with previous experiments. Although list length 2 and 3 differences were \n 26 \nnot significant [t(24)=.26, p=.796, !2=.003 and t(22)=.31, p=.756, !2=.004 \nrespectively], at list length 4 the integrated word response pauses were significantly \nlonger than independent response pauses, t(20)=2.56, p=.029, !2=.247. There was \nalso a difference at list length 5 but this was marginal, t(14)=1.82, p=.090, !2=.191. \nWe then combined the correct recall times for all available list lengths, and this \nconfirmed the longer pauses in the integrated condition, t(24)=2.74, p=.021, \n!2=.238. In the round, the independent words are selected more quickly, but with a \nresponse choice paradigm this is most salient at longer list lengths. \nAnalysis of selection errors \nThe task design places clear constraints on the nature of selection errors. \nSerial order errors could occur but participants could also choose an incorrect \nword. However, opportunities for the different types of error are not constant \nacross trials; at list length 2 for example, there is only one order error possible (the \nstring A-B recalled as B-A) while at list length 3, there are 5 order error \npermutations. Furthermore, the number of protrusion error lures was a constant \ntwo items across list length (necessary to minimise visual screen complexity) and \nthus protrusions are less likely to occur through random selection at larger list \nlengths.  For clarity and brevity, we present analysis of errors after combining data \nfor the disappear and remain conditions.  \nIn what follows we consider data based on performance up to and including \nthe span-terminal level4. Table 3 reports the distribution of response choices. \nErrors are not randomly distributed: there are more order errors than processing-\n                                                \n4 In the \u2018remain\u2019 condition, it is possible to produce a \u2018repeat\u2019 error; many of these \nreflected registration issues for touch screen responses (e.g. immediate repetitions \nwith an interval <0.5 sec). For simplicity, they were coded here as order errors. \n 27 \nphase errors in both the independent condition, t(12)=3.60, p=.004, !2=.519, and \nintegrated condition, t(12)=5.50, p<.001, !2=.716. Furthermore, although there \nwere more processing-phase lures than protrusion lures, error proportions for \nthese two categories were not significantly different, either for the independent or \nintegrated conditions, ts(12)=.48 & -.03 respectively, !2<.019. \nError frequency varied across experimental condition. The proportion of \nprotrusion errors was higher with independent words than integrated words, \nt(24)=2.63, p=.015, !2=.224. The proportion of all selections that were order errors \nwas marginally higher with independent words, t(24)=1.93, p=.069, !2=.134, but \nthe proportion of order errors expressed as a function of correct item information \nwas significantly higher for independent words (M=.251, SD=.136) than integrated \nwords (M=.146, SD=.083), t(24)=2.35, p=.027, !2=.1875.  \nIn the independent condition there is no link between the processing \nmaterial and the target memory word and so there is nothing to bind the \nprocessing episode to word activation levels. Since answers to previous trials are \nlikely to retain activation, they become more susceptible to being chosen. In \ncontrast, for the integrated condition the processing context may help rule out \nthese protrusion lures, making source-monitoring decisions more accurate. In \nother words, an important function of the integration between processing and \nmemory is to tie memoranda more distinctly specific trial episodes. \nFinally, we note that participants were tempted by the presence of \nprocessing-phase lures. All 13 participants in the independent condition selected \nthis lure type at least once, as did 12 \/ 13 participants in the integrated condition. \n                                                \n5 We are grateful to an anonymous reviewer for suggesting this comparison. \n 28 \nDiscussion \nThis experiment addresses several issues. First, it provides output timing \ndata from a complex memory task using touchscreen responses rather than spoken \nrecall. The latter has been highly important in increasing our understanding of \nmemory phenomena (e.g., Cowan et al., 1992; Haberlandt, Lawrence, Krohn, Bowe \n& Thomas, 2005; Tehan & Lalor, 2000) but of course it is possible that some \nphenomena are properties of the specific methods of responding. Spoken recall \ngenerally requires item and order information, yet potentially these dimensions can \nbe systematically manipulated in the current paradigm by varying the selection \nchoices available. From a pragmatic standpoint, measuring spoken recall is a highly \nlabour intensive process. Consequently, it is valuable to additional evidence \navailable from different, more easily registered methods of output. \nIn these terms, the experiment has been a success. Response processes are \nconsistent and systematic, with individuals prone to confusing the sequential order \nof items and substituting no-longer-relevant words and words never explicitly \ndesignated as memory items. These results are consistent with reports from verbal \nsequence recall (Caretti, Cornoldi, De Beni & Romano 2005; Friedman & Miyake, \n2004b) confirming both item and order constraints in WM. \n \nGeneral Discussion \nFour experiments involving either spoken recall or manual item selection \nprovide support for the recall reconstruction hypothesis. This posits that the \nsequence of reading span items may not be fully specified at the point when they \nare cued; instead, access to memoranda embedded within sentence processing may \n 29 \nbe subsequently scaffolded by those sentences, especially when task requirements \nstress the memory word identity (via a word generation requirement).  The \nexperiments present convergent and complementary evidence in the form of recall \ntiming together with information about recall accuracy and error types. Data \nconsistently suggest that the correct recall of words connected with processing \nevents is slower than the correct recall of words unrelated to processing, even \nthough recall accuracy for the integrated format is higher (which, other things \nbeing equal, should lead to faster recall). \nAcross studies reading times were comparable for integrated and \nindependent word conditions and sentence completions were invariably suitable, \nstrongly implying that sentences were processed appropriately in both conditions. \nWe therefore suggest that a sentence context can support access to relevant words \nthat might otherwise not be recalled, albeit at the cost of larger pauses. At the same \ntime, recall time differences are not significant at every list length and some \naccuracy differences emerge only with a larger sample size, emphasising that (a) \nrecall timing can be variable and recall reconstruction may not be required on \nevery trial; and (b) participants may be able to draw on other strategies to retain \nthe memoranda that can in some situations be effective. One possibility is that \nparticipants rely on an imagery-focused strategy (Caretti, Borella & De Beni, 2007). \nAlternatively, there may be an increased reliance on active sequence maintenance \nor primary memory, an interpretation that is consistent with the more rapid recall \nthat we have observed. \nThe response choice method supports the basic finding that pauses are \nshorter in the independent condition although significant effects were not found at \n 30 \nall sequence length. We suspect that there is a less stringent requirement in this \nparadigm to maintain the fidelity of item (as opposed to order) information, \nbecause the correct items are always present at recall. Item representations must \nbe retained since various types of lures are used. Nonetheless, perhaps imperfect \nrepresentations are sufficient for successful reconstruction. \nConway et al. (2005) have noted in passing that reading span studies have \ninvolved both the independent and integrated word format. We are not making \nclaims about which is the theoretically preferred task form, especially in the context \nof individual differences since one might wish to minimise or emphasise the \nreconstructive element in recall. Nonetheless, is it clear each task configuration can \nhave consequences for what reading span measures.  \nSeveral theoretical views consider complex spans\u2019 processing-memory \nrelationship in competitive terms, even where inherently they may not need to do \nso. According to Daneman and Carpenter (1980), the processing activity within a \nworking memory span trial uses general cognitive resources that are consequently \ndenied to retention activities. Span therefore reflects the competitive balance of \nresources between processing and memory. The present data show instead that \nrecall is partly a function of the compatibility between processing and memory, and \nthat processing activity produces representations that affect recall, providing a \nsource of both recall facilitation and interference. Processing and retention in \nreading span are therefore not as functionally distinct as considered hitherto.  \nThe recall reconstruction hypothesis \u2013 proposing that longer pauses in the \nrecall of information from working memory derive from memory search through \nthe processing episodes \u2013 has resonances with conclusions from conceptual span \n 31 \n(Haarmann, Davelaar & Usher, 2003), which involves partial recall of sequences \nvia category cues. Haarmann et al. (2003) report overlap between reading span and \nconceptual span, even though the latter does not require the conventional \n\u2018processing plus memory\u2019 combination. The present data encourage the view that \nboth these paradigms overlap in terms of recall processes and both reflect a link \nbetween encoding context and recall.  \nThe recall reconstruction hypothesis for reading span also has some \nparallels with the \u2018regeneration\u2019 account of sentence recall (Potter & Lombardi, \n1990; 1998; Schweppe & Rummer, 2007). When individuals recall sentences \nverbatim, they are prone to substitute semantically compatible words presented \nprior to recall, and make subtle grammatical changes to the sentence structure \nwhen primed by other sentences. The regeneration account proposes that these \nerrors occur because participants remember general semantic features and \nrelations, with sentences regenerated from partial traces. The current proposal is \nthat with an integrated reading span trial, individuals may likewise use sentence \nrepresentations to augment recall. In a related vein, Schweickert (1993) has argued \nfor \u2018redintegrative\u2019 processes in immediate serial recall, whereby gaps in \nincomplete representations of words can be filled in by lexical knowledge. In sum, \nwhilst the present recall reconstruction hypothesis is a novel account of complex \nspan performance, it echoes and indeed elaborates other approaches in the \nliterature that emphasise the potential breadth of sources for making memory \ndecisions and the constructive nature of temporary memory (e.g. Coane, McBride, \nRaulerson & Jordan, 2007; Craik & Lockhart, 1972). \n 32 \nWe conclude that reconstructive processes can operate on what are often \ndegraded representations during reading span recall. These processes may include \nmemory search and decision-making drawing upon \u2018contextual\u2019 information from a \nvariety of domains or content (e.g., Unsworth & Engle, 2006). Moreover, the \npresent data show that WM theories typically adopt too simplistic an approach to \nthe relationship between mental operations and information retention.  Whereas \nmost theories propose some form of competitive relationship, our data show that \nprocessing operations leave their own memory traces that can influence span \nperformance. In producing evidence for this view, the paper emphasises the value \nof recall timing as a way of understanding immediate memory processes. \n 33 \nReferences \n \nBaddeley, A. D., & Hitch, G. J.

This high level of performance is advantageous in \nmaximising the data density for analysis of correct recall.  \nSeveral recall phenomena are evident from Figure 5. First, mean word \narticulation at approximately .4 sec, is similar to reading span data. Second, pauses \nbetween words are much shorter, but non-negligible, at less than .2 sec. Third, the \npreparatory intervals are approximately three times longer than interword pauses, \nconsistent with the interpretation that they reflect a different mental activity. Data \ncontrast dramatically with reading span recall that is much longer (note a different \nscale is used across Figures), and there are large, almost qualitative changes in the \npattern of responding across list lengths. \n 41 \nTable 1.
