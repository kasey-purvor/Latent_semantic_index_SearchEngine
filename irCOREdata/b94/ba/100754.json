INTRODUCTION\nTHE RECENT integration of Si Ge alloys into sil-icon technologies has made it possible to incorporate\nbandgap engineering concepts into silicon devices that were\npreviously only possible in compound semiconductor devices.\nThe Si Ge heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) [1] was\nthe first example of the exploitation of bandgap engineering\nin silicon technology and further applications are currently\nbeing developed, such as the p-channel Si Ge MOSFET\nwith a compressively strained-Si Ge channel [2] and the\nn-channel strained-Si MOSFET [3] with a tensile strained-Si\nchannel grown on a Si Ge virtual substrate.\nThe increasing use of Si Ge in bipolar and MOS tran-\nsistors highlights the need to better understand dopant diffu-\nsion in Si Ge and in particular to investigate methods of\nreducing dopant diffusion, which has been shown to signifi-\ncantly degrade device performance. In Si Ge HBTs, out-\ndiffusion of boron from the Si Ge base creates potential\nenergy barriers [4] and limits the achievable basewidth, both\nof which degrade the achievable value of and [5]. In\nSi Ge and strained-Si MOSFETs diffusion of boron in the\npocket and the highly doped source\/drain has detrimental ef-\nfects on short-channel effects [6]. Boron diffusion can arise from\nthermal diffusion during annealing of deposited boron-doped\nlayers and from transient enhanced diffusion (TED) [7] due to\nthe annealing of ion implanted layers.\nOver the past few years, considerable research effort has\nbeen invested in the search for methods of reducing boron\ndiffusion in Si and Si Ge . The incorporation of carbon into\nSi Ge during growth has been shown to significantly reduce\nboron diffusion in Si Ge [8] and has delivered Si Ge\nHBTs with values of and approaching 300 GHz [5].\nWhile this is a simple and effective method of controlling\nboron diffusion in Si Ge HBTs, it is not without difficul-\nties. For example, interstitial carbon increases substantially at\nhigher carbon contents [9]. Fluorine implantation has also been\nstudied as a method of reducing boron diffusion in silicon, and\nit has been shown that fluorine both suppresses boron TED in\nsilicon [10]\u2013[16] and boron thermal diffusion [17]. Recently,\nthe authors have also shown that fluorine suppresses boron\ndiffusion in Si Ge [18] [19].\nIn this paper, a study is made of the effect of fluorine im-\nplantation dose on boron TED and boron thermal diffusion in\n0018-9383\/$20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

It is shown that boron TED is eliminated at all fluo-\nrine doses studied and correlates with a deep fluorine peak at a\ndepth corresponding to the range of the fluorine implant. Reduc-\ntion of boron thermal diffusion occurs above a critical fluorine\ndose of \u2013 cm and correlates with the appearance of a\nshallow fluorine peak. Explanations are proposed for the natures\nof these shallow and deep fluorine peaks and for their effect on\nboron thermal and TED. Values of boron diffusion coefficient\nfor different fluorine doses are obtained from simulation of the\nmeasured profiles.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\nLow-pressure chemical vapor deposition at 850 C (growth\nA) and 800 C (growth B) was used to grow layers analogous\nto those used in Si Ge HBTs. Layers grown included a Si\nstarter layer, a Si Ge layer and a Si cap layer on a (100)\nsilicon wafer. Boron doped marker layers were incorporated\nwithin the Si Ge layers with peak concentrations of\ncm (growth A, 6% Ge) and cm (growth B, 11%\nGe). Four types of samples were then produced from the same\nwafer; the first had no implants (unimplanted), the second a\nphosphorus implant only (P implanted), the third a phosphorus\nand a fluorine implant (P & F implanted) and the fourth a flu-\norine implant only (F implanted). A 288 keV, cm\nphosphorus implant was used with an energy and dose similar to\nthose used for selective implanted collectors. The F was im-\nplanted at 185 keV, with a dose in the range cm\nto cm and with the energy chosen to give a flu-\norine peak coincident with the phosphorus peak. The samples\nwere annealed by rapid thermal annealing in nitrogen at 1000 C\nfor 30 s. Boron (B11), fluorine (F19), and germanium (Ge74)\nconcentration depth profiles were obtained on all samples by\nsecondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS). The layers were also\nanalyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The an-\nnealed boron SIMS profiles were fitted using the fully coupled\ndiffusion model in the SILVACO ATHENA simulation program\nand the diffusion coefficients were extracted from the best fits\nobtained.\nIII. RESULTS\nFig. 1 shows boron SIMS profiles in samples implanted with\nF at a dose in the range cm to cm\nand annealed at 1000 C. For the sample implanted with P only\n(P implanted), Fig. 1(a) shows that the anneal gives consider-\nable out-diffusion of the boron profile into the adjacent silicon\nlayers due to TED arising from the point defects introduced by\nthe P implant. The SIMS profile for the P and F implanted\nsample (P and F implanted), indicates that the amount of\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Boron profiles after anneal at 1000 C for 30 s for growth B samples\nimplanted with P and F (long dash line), with P only (dot dash line) and\nwith F only (short dash line), and for samples with no implants (dotted line).\nResults are shown for fluorine implantation doses of (a) 2:3\u0002 10 cm , and\n(b) 1 \u0002 10 cm . As-grown boron and germanium profiles are also shown\nfor reference.\nboron diffusion is dramatically less than that in the sample im-\nplanted with P only and is comparable with the amount of\nboron diffusion in the unimplanted sample (unimplanted). This\nindicates that the cm F implant has completely\nsuppressed boron TED resulting from the phosphorus implant.\nSimilar results are seen in Fig. 1(b) for a F implant of\ncm .\nFig. 1(c) shows SIMS profiles for a cm F implant\nand very different behavior is observed. In this case, the amount\nof boron diffusion in the P & F implanted sample is not only\ndramatically less than that in the sample implanted with P only,\nbut also significantly less than that in the unimplanted sample.\nFurthermore, the amount of boron diffusion in the P & F\nimplanted sample is similar to that in the F implanted sample\n(F implanted). These results indicate that a cm F\nimplant not only suppresses boron TED but also significantly\ndecreases boron thermal diffusion. Similar behavior is seen for\na F dose of cm , as shown in Fig. 1(d).\nFig. 2 shows boron SIMS profiles in samples implanted with\nhigher F doses of cm (Fig. 2(a)) and\ncm [Fig. 2(b)]. It should be noted that these profiles were\nobtained on a different wafer (growth B) than those in Fig. 1\nTABLE I\nSUMMARY OF THE REDUCTION OF BORON DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT IN\nSAMPLES IMPLANTED WITH P & F AND WITH F ONLY. THE VALUES OF\nBORON DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT FOR THE P and F IMPLANTED SAMPLES\nWERE NORMALISED TO THE DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT FOR THE P IMPLANTED\nSAMPLE AND THE VALUES OF BORON DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT FOR THE\nF IMPLANTED SAMPLES WERE NORMALISED TO THE DIFFUSION\nCOEFFICIENT FOR THE UNIMPLANTED SAMPLE\n(growth A). These samples show a similar trend to that seen in\nFig. 1(d), namely these high dose F implants not only suppress\nboron TED resulting from the P implant but also significantly\ndecrease boron thermal diffusion.\nValues of boron diffusion coefficient were extracted by fitting\nto the measured boron profiles and values of diffusion reduction\nfactor are summarized in Table I. For the sample implanted with\nP and cm F , the fluorine implant reduced the\nboron diffusion coefficient by a factor of 12.9 compared with\nthe P implanted sample.\nFig. 3 shows fluorine SIMS profiles in growth A samples im-\nplanted with P & F at a dose in the range cm to\ncm and annealed at 1000 C. For the two lowest\nfluorine implantation doses of cm and\ncm , negligible fluorine is present (at the SIMS background\nof cm ) in the vicinity of the Si Ge layer after\nanneal. The majority of the fluorine is located in a broad peak,\nwhich for a F dose of cm is slightly deeper than\nthe range of the fluorine implant ( m), and for a F dose\nof cm is at a similar depth as the fluorine implant\n( m). For a fluorine dose of cm , Fig. 3(c)\nshows two additional peaks in the Si Ge layer at depths of\n0.16 and 0.19 m, which correspond with the positions of the\ntop and bottom heterojunction interfaces. A small shoulder on\nthe deep fluorine peak can also be seen between 0.22 and 0.28\nm. For a F dose of cm , Fig. 3(d) shows a sim-\nilar set of fluorine peaks as seen in Fig. 3(c). An interesting fea-\nture of the peak at the bottom heterojunction interface (0.19 m\npeak) is that the fluorine concentration after anneal (\ncm ) is considerably higher than the concentration at the same\ndepth after implant ( cm ).\nFig. 4 shows fluorine SIMS profiles of samples implanted\nwith P and F at a dose of cm or\ncm and annealed at 1000 C.

It is also interesting to\nnote that for F doses of and cm , the\nfluorine concentration after anneal at the bottom interface is\nsignificantly higher than at the top interface. The fluorine and\ngermanium profiles in Fig. 3 show that this higher fluorine con-\ncentration correlates with a higher germanium concentration.\nFluorine SIMS profiles were also measured for samples im-\nplanted with F only (no P implant) at doses in the range\ncm to cm . An example is shown in\nFig. 5 for a F implant of cm . It can be seen that\nthis profile is nearly identical to that in Fig. 3(d). The same re-\nsult was obtained for all the other fluorine doses, indicating that\nthe fluorine profiles are not significantly influenced by the pres-\nence of the phosphorus.\nFig. 6(a) and (b) shows cross-sectional TEM micrographs of a\nsample implanted with P and cm F and annealed\nat 1000 C and Figs. 6(c) and (d) show micrographs of a sample\nfrom the same wafer, implanted with a F dose of\ncm .

The higher magni-\nfication micrograph in Fig. 6(b) shows that the defects consist\nof dislocation loops of various sizes ranging from around 16 to\n62 nm. For the higher F dose implant in Fig. 6(c), a band of\ndefects can be seen extending from a depth of 0.28 to 0.52 m,\ntogether with a line of defects at the growth interface at a depth\nof 0.57 m. Once again no defects are seen in the Si Ge\nlayer. The higher magnification image in Fig. 6(d) shows that\nthe defects consist of dislocation loops, with various shapes and\nsizes ranging from around 16 to 62 nm.

The shallow\nand middle Si Ge layers can be seen as dark bands, but the\ndeepest Si Ge layer cannot be clearly discerned, presum-\nably because the germanium content is too low (3%). There are\nno defects in the vicinity of the shallow Si Ge layer, but a\nbroad band of dislocation loops traverses the deepest Si Ge\nlayer, analogous to those seen earlier in Fig. 6(c) and (d). The\nmiddle Si Ge layer shows interesting defect structure, as\na line of defects can be seen inside the Si Ge layer, with\nno defects in the Si above the Si Ge layer and few defects\nin the Si immediately below the Si Ge layer. The defects\nin the middle Si Ge layer consist of dislocation loops with\ndiameters varying from 16 nm to 49 nm.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThe results in Figs. 1 and 3 show a correlation between a\nreduction in boron thermal diffusion and the appearance, at a\nF dose of cm , of fluorine peaks in the Si Ge\nlayer. In contrast boron TED is suppressed for all fluorine doses\nstudied and a deep fluorine peak is seen at all doses. These re-\nsults suggest that the shallow fluorine peak is responsible for the\nreduction of boron thermal diffusion and the deep fluorine peak\nfor the suppression of boron TED.\nThe fluorine peaks in the Si Ge layer in Fig. 3 lie at depths\nof 0.16 and 0.19 m, which correspond to 0.35 and ,\nwhere is the range of the fluorine implant. These fluorine\npeaks are not due to the presence of boron as similar fluorine\npeaks were seen in the undoped Si Ge multilayer structure\nin Fig. 8. Simulations of vacancy and interstitial profiles after\nimplantation [20], [21] have predicted a vacancy-rich region ex-\ntending from the surface to a depth approaching the implanta-\ntion range, , and a deeper interstitial-rich region peaking at a\ndepth just beyond . This indicates that the fluorine peaks in\nthe Si Ge layer lie in the vacancy-rich region of the damage\nprofile. The TEM micrograph in Fig. 6(c) shows no evidence\nof line defects in the Si Ge layer and hence any trapping\nof fluorine at defects in the Si Ge layer must be due to de-\nfects that are too small to resolve by TEM. There is considerable\nevidence in the literature for the formation of vacancy-fluorine\nclusters in silicon [16], [22], [23], and in our previous work on\nthe effect of fluorine on boron thermal diffusion in silicon [24],\nwe showed that vacancy-fluorine clusters were responsible for\na reduction in boron thermal diffusion above a critical fluorine\ndose of to cm . In the current work, similar\nbehavior is seen, although the critical fluorine dose in Si Ge\nis a little lower than that in Si, lying between and\ncm . Given the similarity of our Si Ge results\nwith results in Si, we conclude that the fluorine peaks in the\nSi Ge layer are due to fluorine trapped at vacancy-fluorine\nclusters. These clusters would be expected to give rise to a sup-\npression of the interstitial concentration in the Si Ge layer,\nsince any interstitials in the Si Ge could be annihilated at\nthe clusters. Since boron diffusion in Si Ge is mediated by\ninterstitials, an under-saturation of the interstitial concentration\nin the Si Ge layer would explain the suppression of boron\nthermal diffusion seen for fluorine doses of cm and\nabove.\nThe deep fluorine peak around the range of the fluorine\nimplant is largely in the interstitial-rich region of the fluorine\ndamage profile, and hence it is likely that it is related in some\nway to interstitial-fluorine defects. A comparison of the SIMS\nprofiles in Fig. 4(a) with the TEM micrograph in Fig. 6(c),\nshows that the deep fluorine peak lies between about 0.28\nand 0.55 m, which compares with the band of dislocation\nloops between about 0.28 and 0.52 m. Thus there is a good\ncorrelation with the depth of the dislocation loops, indicating\nthat the deep fluorine peak is due to fluorine trapping at the\ndislocation loops. A cm F implant does not\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 26, 2009 at 11:11 from IEEE Xplore.

Similar\ninterstitial-type defects have been reported after anneal by Pi\net al. [23] for a F implant and by Wu et al. [26] for a BF\nimplant.\nThe generally accepted model for TED of boron is that self-\ninterstitials are lost from extended defects by emission\nof single interstitial atoms [27]. The released interstitials ei-\nther diffuse to other defects, such as dislocation loops (Ostwald\nripening), or to the surface (dissolution). The diffusion of inter-\nstitials to the surface gives rise to TED in boron layers located\nnear the surface. The results in Figs. 6 and 7 show that the band\nof dislocation loops is present in the samples implanted with\nP & F (Fig. 6) but not in samples implanted with P only\n(Fig. 7), indicating that fluorine plays a key role in the formation\nof the band of dislocation loops. This result suggests that fluo-\nrine enhances the Ostwald ripening process, so that self-inter-\nstitials lost from defects diffuse to the dislocation loops,\nrather than to the surface. This mechanism would reduce the\nbackflow of interstitials to the surface and hence would explain\nthe suppression of boron TED seen in samples implanted with\nP & F .\nThe evolution of the shapes of the fluorine peaks in the\nSi Ge layer in Figs. 3 and 4 with increasing fluorine dose\nshows some interesting trends. For fluorine doses of\nand cm the fluorine concentration after anneal\nis much higher at the bottom heterojunction interface than\nthe top interface, as shown in Table II. Fig. 3 shows that the\nfluorine concentration at the interfaces correlates with the\ngermanium concentrations, which are cm at the\nbottom interface and cm at the top interface. For\na fluorine dose of cm (growth B), the fluorine\nconcentrations after anneal at the two interfaces are similar,\nwhich correlates with very similar germanium concentrations\nat the two interfaces. This correlation between fluorine and\ngermanium concentrations suggests that the concentration of\nvacancy-fluorine clusters in the Si Ge layer increases with\ngermanium content. The fluorine profiles in Figs. 3(d) and 4\nshow that the fluorine concentration in the Si Ge layer after\nanneal is much higher than the concentration after implant and\nalso that the fluorine concentration in the silicon immediately\nadjacent to the Si Ge layer is much lower than within the\nSi Ge layer. These results imply the transport of fluorine\nduring the anneal from the adjacent Si into the Si Ge layer,\nwhere it accumulates to reach levels much higher than was\npresent after implant. This result, and the above dependence\nof fluorine concentration on germanium content, suggests that\nvacancy-fluorine clusters form more readily in Si Ge than\nin Si, which could be explained by the lower formation energy\nof vacancies in Ge than in Si, as reported by Dalpian et al.\n[28]. The presence of strain in the Si Ge layer may also\nhave an influence on the vacancy-fluorine cluster formation.\nFinally, Fig. 3 also shows that the fluorine concentration at the\nSi\/Si Ge interfaces is lower than the concentration within\nthe Si Ge layer. This result can be explained by the ten-\ndency of fluorine to segregate to interfaces [24], as can be seen\nin Fig. 4, where fluorine is segregated at the growth interface.\nFor devices like Si Ge HBTs, where the boron needs to\nbe confined within the Si Ge layer, the above migration of\nfluorine from the adjacent silicon into the Si Ge has im-\nportant benefits. This mechanism automatically leads to a high\nfluorine concentration in the Si Ge layer, which is precisely\nwhere the boron profile is located in a Si Ge HBT. The ef-\nfect of the fluorine in reducing the boron thermal diffusion is\ntherefore automatically maximized. Furthermore, this transport\nof fluorine into the Si Ge layer implies that high concentra-\ntions of fluorine can be obtained in the Si Ge layer without\nthe need to precisely position the fluorine implant with respect\nto the Si Ge layer.\nThe fluorine SIMS profile for the sample implanted with\ncm F in Fig. 4(b) shows the presence of an additional\nsurface fluorine peak in the silicon cap layer at a depth be-\ntween 0.03 and 0.07 m. This surface fluorine peak is in the\nvacancy-rich region of the fluorine damage profile and hence is\nlikely to be due to vacancy-fluorine clusters. Earlier work on the\neffects of fluorine in silicon [24] showed that a critical fluorine\nconcentration after implant of \u2013 cm was needed\nfor vacancy-fluorine clusters to form in silicon. Fig. 4(b) shows\nthat the fluorine concentration after implant in the vicinity of\nthis additional shallow fluorine peak is between and\ncm cm , which is well above the critical con-\ncentration for vacancy-fluorine cluster formation. The presence\nof this additional shallow fluorine peak in Fig. 4(b) can therefore\nbe explained by the high fluorine concentration in the silicon cap\nlayer after a cm F implant.\nThe cross-sectional TEM micrograph of the Si Ge mul-\ntilayer in Fig. 9 shows no defects in the shallow Si Ge layer\nbut a line of dislocation loops in the middle Si Ge layer.\nThe shallow Si Ge layer lies at a depth of 0.13\u20130.19 m\n\u2013 , which places it in the vacancy-rich region of\nthe implant damage profile. In contrast, the middle Si Ge\nlayer lies at a depth of 0.32\u20130.36 m \u2013 , which\nplaces it on the edge of the interstitial-rich region of the damage\nprofile [20], [21]. This suggests that the formation of the dis-\nlocation loops in the middle Si Ge layer has been driven\nby a high interstitial concentration. The absence of loops in the\nshallow Si Ge layer indicates that a fluorine implant will not\ngenerate dislocation loops in Si Ge provided the Si Ge\nlayer is located in the vacancy-rich region of the implant damage\nprofile.\nV. CONCLUSION\nA study has been carried out of the effect of fluorine implants\nwith doses in the range cm to cm on\nthe TED and thermal diffusion of boron in Si Ge . A re-\nduction of boron thermal diffusion is observed for F doses at\nand above a dose of cm , whereas a suppression of\nboron TED is observed for all F doses studied. The reduction\nof boron thermal diffusion correlates with the appearance of flu-\norine peaks in the Si Ge layer at and above a dose of\ncm . TEM micrographs show that there are no extended de-\nfects in the Si Ge layer, and hence it is proposed that the flu-\norine peaks are due to vacancy-fluorine clusters.

This mechanism would give\nbenefits in devices like Si Ge HBTs, where the boron pro-\nfile needs to be confined within the Si Ge layer, since a high\nfluorine concentration is automatically obtained in the vicinity\nof the boron profile, which maximizes the effect of fluorine in\nsuppressing boron diffusion.\nREFERENCES\n[1] G.
