A central theme in this change of direction has involved a conscious effort to take \nthe farmyard out of rural studies, shifting the focus from issues of agricultural production to \nquestions of rural consumption, and from farming to non-farm pursuits. Without such a \nchange of direction, some scholars suggested, rural studies was at risk of dying \u2013 or at least \nbeing subsumed within political-economy studies with their roots in industrial geography \nscholarship. A central reason for this change in emphasis, which can be dated from the mid-\n1960s, was a recognition that rural areas, as coherent economic and social spaces, were \nfragmenting and diverging (see Ibery, 1998). Rural society was increasingly composed of \npeople with different, and sometimes conflicting interests. New patterns of alliance and \ncompetition were emerging between producers and consumers of rural space. Furthermore, \nS:\\Staff\\DRO - Durham Research Online\\FullText\\Departments\\Geography\\1271\\Journal Rural \nStudies 2002 Production and consumption in Thailand.docx \n2 \nthe centrality of farming in the rural economy and rural people\u2018s livelihoods (which are not \nthe same things) was under threat as non-farm activities infiltrated the countryside and the \ndelocalisation of work advanced (Mormont, 1990, pp. 30-1; Cloke 1998). \u2015\u2026The central \norganizing principles established in postwar times\u2016 Marsden writes of the developed world \n\u2015\u2026have been largely overtaken by the tide of a rural (and urban) restructuring process which \nhas been both economically and socially driven\u2016 (Marsden, 1998, p. 15). This has taken much \nrural studies scholarship in the developed world, and particularly in the UK, down a post-\nproductivist road.\n1\n These arguments are well-rehearsed in the literature. \nBut this change of direction has failed to make much of an impact in developing \nworld rural studies. The reasons are clear. For while agriculture in rural areas of the developed \nworld has become a marginal activity supporting a minority of inhabitants in the countryside, \nin the developing world agricultural remains \u2013 on the face of it at least \u2013 the fulcrum on which \nthe great majority of rural livelihoods are balanced. But this belief that rural=agricultural in \nthe developing is being increasingly challenged. Work on \u2017de-agrarianisation\u2018 in Africa \n(Bryceson, 1996; Bryceson and Jamal, 1997), Latin America (Preston, 1992; Zoomers and \nKleinpenning, 1996), and Asia (Rigg, 2001; Franks et al., 1999) is already substantial.\n2\n There \nis a second explanation for the persistence of a farming perspective in developing areas rural \nstudies. Namely, the belief that farming is not just an economic activity but a \u2017way of life\u2018 that \nbestows a distinctive character on rural societies. In short, rural studies, rural sociology, and \nrural development are alive and well in the developing world. To a significant extent, \nscholarly \u2017advances\u2018 as well as rural transformations in the developed world seem to have \npassed such areas by. \n This paper does not aim to correct this imbalance. Indeed there is a case that the \nreason why post-productivist rural scholarship on the developing world has yet to make much \nof a mark is because it is out of step with rural realities in the poor world. While we would not \nwish to argue that agriculture has become, in toto, a marginal activity we do believe that the \noverwhelming focus on farming and farmers, both socially and economically, has meant that \nscholars have tended to overlook some nascent but nonetheless highly significant changes in \nrural spaces in the poorer, majority world. Furthermore, a failure sufficiently to appreciate the \nscale and pace of change has led to misinterpretations of the bases of agricultural \ntransformations.\n3\n \nTo this end, the paper sets out to achieve three things, drawing on the experience of \nThailand. First, to investigate the construction of Thai rurality, tracing this back to the late 13\nth\n \ncentury. Second to show how this image and historical construction has insinuated itself into \nscholarly and applied views of rural areas and people, the problems they face, and how best to \nsolve them. And finally, to demonstrate, using this imagined rurality, how agricultural \nproduction and rural society has been coopted (from within and without) for purposes of \nconsumption. These three elements of the paper cover a period of more than seven centuries \nand take the discussion from the realms of distant history and issues of nation-building \nthrough to emerging evidence in support of a gradual shift from production in the countryside \nto consumption of the countryside. The importance of the past in the present is illuminated \nthrough a discussion of the way in which Thai scholars and non-governmental organisations \n(NGOs) have used constructions of \u2017tradition\u2018 to make a case for a \u2017new\u2018 development. \nWe suggest that many of the issues concentrating the minds of scholars working on \nthe developed world are applicable to the developing world \u2013 even if the contexts are self-\nevidently different. Moreover the developing world offers particular lessons for, and insights \ninto, models of change based on a reading of the Northern experience. While we do not reject \nentirely the transferability of such models to the South, we do suggest (based on the Thai \nexperience) that this cannot be done wholesale and without recognition of the particular \nhistorical trajectories and embedded social and economic structures that inform processes of \nchange in any particular place. While certain indicators of a post-productivist countryside \u2013 \norganic farming, pluriactivity, and the growing power of environmental NGOs, for example \u2013 \nare to be found in rural areas of the South, the meaning of these indicators is importantly \ndifferent. Therefore their presence should not be taken to mean that a process directly akin to \nthat marked out for the North is occurring. \nS:\\Staff\\DRO - Durham Research Online\\FullText\\Departments\\Geography\\1271\\Journal Rural \nStudies 2002 Production and consumption in Thailand.docx \n3 \n \nWhat \u2013 and who \u2013 is rural Thailand? \nWork on \u2017the rural\u2018 in the developed world has explored the extent to which the rural idyll has \nbeen constructed as a counterpoint to urban\/industrial life and work. \u2015The concept of the \nrural\u2016, Mormont writes, \u2015evolved by distinguishing the rural and the agricultural, and by \ndefining the rural in relation to the social and cultural context created by industrial \ndevelopment...\u2016 (Mormont, 1990, p. 22). A similar, but less well documented (at least in the \nmainstream academic literature) debate has been underway in parts of the developing world \nand, in this instance, in Thailand. \n In Thailand, contemporary constructions of the rural can be linked back in time to the \nso-called Inscription no. 1 of 1292 which describes a bountiful land where rice and fish \nabounded, ruled by a great and benevolent monarch (of course), King Ramkhamhaeng \n(?1279-1298). This description is widely regarded as the first work of Thai literature (Manas \nChitakasem 1999, p. 47) and has been paraded by some as Thailand\u2018s first Constitution (see \nSeni Pramoj, 1990, p. 23). The opening lines are memorised by every Thai schoolchild: \n \n\u2017In the time of King Ramkhamhaeng, this land of Sukhothai is thriving. In the water there \nis fish, in the fields there is rice.\u2018 \n \nThe inscription paints a picture of a righteous monarch ruling wisely in the interests of his \npeople over a bounteous land.\n4\n The King \u2017taxes not his people\u2018, whoever plants groves of \nbetel or areca \u2017unto him shall they belong\u2018, \u2017whoever wants to play, plays\u2026whoever wants to \nlaugh, laughs \u2026whoever want to sing, sings\u2018. And so on. The words of the inscription have \nalso been embraced by the academic community (both Thai and non-Thai), reflected in the \nfact that the \u2017In the water there is fish\u2026\u2018 lines must be used to grace the opening pages of \nmore books and more chapters of books on Thailand than any other single quote. For Seni \nPramoj the inscription \u2017bears no false witness\u2018 (1990, p. 26) and its veracity and honesty are \nbeyond reproach.  \nNotwithstanding Seni\u2018s view, the 1990s has seen a heated debate over whether the \ninscription is authentic, or a forgery. \u2017Discovered\u2018 by the future King Mongkut when he was \na prince in 1833, it served to prove to the encroaching colonial powers (Thailand is the only \ncountry of Southeast Asia never to have been colonised) that Thailand was not just an empty \nspace but a legitimate kingdom with a long and glorious history that deserved to be treated \nwith some respect, if not as an equal. Subsequently, the inscription became a key building \nblock of Thai history \u2013 and a central column in the edifice of Thai nationhood. As Manas \nChitakasem writes of the forgery allegations, they \u2015sent shock waves throughout the \ncommunity of Thai scholars and scholars of Thailand alike\u2016. This was not just an arcane \nacademic debate over whether an inscription was engraved in the late 13\nth\n century during \nThailand\u2018s Golden Period or was a 19th century forgery designed to serve contemporary \npolitical ends. To quote Manas again: \u2015The controversy shook the very foundations of Thai \nknowledge, Thai studies, Thai-ness and even the whole Thai nation\u2016 (1999, p. 51). From the \nperspective of the conceptualisation of rural Thailand the inscription represents the starting \npoint for scores of papers, books, newspaper articles and speeches that use what we would \nsuggest is an imagined past to cast doubt on and to question the present and, importantly, to \nprovide a template from which a more sustainable, egalitarian, moral and \u2017Thai\u2018 future can be \ninscribed. \nPerhaps the most influential such academic publication is Chatthip Nartsupha\u2018s slim \nThe Thai village economy in the past (Sethakit mubaan Thai nai odiit), originally published in \nThai in 1984 with an English translation released in 1999. The book begins with the simple \nsentence \u2015Thai peoples are rice growers\u2016 (1999, p. 9) and then quotes the 12th century Chiang \nRung (Chiang Hung) chronicles: \u2017wherever there is water, there is the Thai\u2018 (1999, p. 9). \nWhile Chatthip\u2018s book is, ostensibly, a reinterpretation of historical change in Thailand it was \nquickly taken up by radical academics and NGO activists. In particular it was used to \nhighlight the perceived shortcomings of the modernisation process in Thailand by \nunfavourably comparing contemporary rural life (unequal and dependent) with rural life in the \nS:\\Staff\\DRO - Durham Research Online\\FullText\\Departments\\Geography\\1271\\Journal Rural \nStudies 2002 Production and consumption in Thailand.docx \n4 \npast (meagre but egalitarian and self-sufficient). This unfavourable comparison has been used \nto support \u2013 practically \u2013 and inform \u2013 intellectually \u2013 a \u2017new\u2018, village-centred approach to \ndevelopment known as the Community Culture school of thought, or Wattanatham \nChumchon. Chatthip\u2018s book represents the ideological and theoretical heart of this new rural \ndevelopment ethos and it, in turn, has guided the work and practice of a good number of Thai \nNGOs (see Chatthip Nartsupha, 1986; 1991; 1996; Rigg, 1991; 1993; Hewison, 1993; 1999). \nIt is significant that one of the more widely read development texts in this field is Seri \nPhongphit\u2018s Back to the roots (1986) which makes much play of the need to see the \u2017answer\u2018 \nto the problems of the present, in the past. In this way Chatthip\u2018s treatise, fewer than 100 \npages in length, has become much more than a seminal academic tract. It is one of the few \nscholarly works that has had a direct impact on the \u2017real\u2018 Thai world and people\u2018s lives. The \nappeal of Chatthip\u2018s work in Thailand is partly because he maps out a Thai (re)interpretation \nof historical and social change, one that self-consciously rejects re-hashed Western \nperspectives and conceptual models.\n5\n \n \nConstructing the rural past, interpreting the rural present \nThe core of Chatthip\u2018s argument framed in The Thai village economy in the past is that \nvillages \u2013 and village communities \u2013 are \u2017primordial\u2018 and that the state and capitalism have \nintruded into these communities against the will of the people (\u2017dragged into the market \nsystem\u2018, as he puts it, page 50). While villagers resisted this incursion and the subsistence \neconomy persisted for far longer than is usually thought, they were ultimately powerless, and \nexploitation arose. The former subsistence (\u2017in the beginning things had no price\u2018), \ncommunity-oriented, class-less and undifferentiated village society was, in the process, \nundermined. While the book does not offer any explicit suggestions as to how a more people-\ncentred mode of development might be achieved in Thailand,\n6\n the telling critique of change is \nregarded as an indictment of what has happened to traditional rural communities as they have \nbeen infiltrated by the state and the market. \nChatthip\u2018s laudable aim was to overturn the smug prevailing historical discourse that \nessentially saw the country as being guided by a series of prescient monarchs or \u2017Lords of \nLife\u2018. The people were denied an autonomous history and were instead defined only in terms \nof their role as loyal, dutiful and grateful subjects. As historian Thongchai Winichakul \nsuggests, all chao ban nok \u2013 rural folk \u2013 were just chao ban nok, an undifferentiated mass of \nignorant, simple, uneducated peasants, an economic resource to be exploited, but not worth \nunderstanding (2000, p. 536). They were, as he says, the \u2017Others Within\u2018 (page 537). \nHowever, in eschewing the established Royalist interpretation of Thailand\u2018s history, and \nturning to a peasant-based history, it could be argued that Chatthip and his followers simply \nreplaced one imagined construction with another.\n7\n \nBut, imagined or not, and as noted above, Chatthip\u2018s views have been embraced by \nthe NGO community and, more latterly, by many of those in the Thai establishment and \nmainstream. Significantly, in the wake of Thailand\u2018s economic crisis and with the explicit \nsupport of the King of Thailand, there has emerged a reinvigorated effort to create a \u2017self-\nsufficient economy\u2018 (sethakit phor piang) based on integrated agriculture. Once again, the \nvision of the traditional Thai village \u2017community\u2018 is used as the template on which this new, \nreborn, rurality is to be founded. In his 70\nth\n birthday address in December 1997 (five months \ninto Thailand\u2018s economic crisis) the King of Thailand said: \n \n\u2015Being a [economic] tiger is not important. What is important is to have enough to eat and \nto live, and to have an economy which provides enough to eat and live. \u2026 If we can \nchange back to a self-sufficient economy, not complete, even not as much as half, perhaps \njust a quarter, we can survive. \u2026 We need to move backwards in order to move forwards\u2016 \n(quoted in Pasuk Phongpaichit and Baker 2000, p. 193). \n \nThe King\u2018s vision, along with the applied and academic work of scholars and development \nworkers like Chatthip Nartsupha (1991; 1999), Seri Phongphit (1986; 1989; 1990), Kitahara \n(1996), Pinit Ratanakul and U Kyaw Than (1990), Uraivan Tan-Kim-Yong (1995) and \nS:\\Staff\\DRO - Durham Research Online\\FullText\\Departments\\Geography\\1271\\Journal Rural \nStudies 2002 Production and consumption in Thailand.docx \n5 \nothers, has been characterised as a \u2017localism discourse\u2018 that \u2015asserts the significance of the \nrural community as an opposition to economic growth\u2026\u2016 (Hewison, 1999, p. 10; see also \nHewison 2001). Part of this localism discourse (now generally known as the New Localism) \nemphasises the role of the traditional village as a self-sufficient and self-reliant economic \nunit. But, and significantly, the traditional village is also framed as an ethical social and \ncultural community where economics is subservient to other considerations. \nA key word in the debate over the real rural Thailand is \u2017community\u2018. There are a \nnumber of threads to this. First of all the focus on community emphasises (self-evidently) the \ncommunalism of rural life and shifts attention away from the individual and the household. \nFurthermore, and second, in making the focus the community rather than the individual the \nemphasis also shifts from economy (individual wants) to society (group needs) and the \ncultural composition of rural Thailand. Taking this sequence of associations a little further, \nand third, the emphasis on community and society\/culture also draws a neat line between \nurban\/industrial society and its articulation with the global economy and rural\/agricultural \nsociety and its links with tradition. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the shift from \ncommunity to individual, impelled by modernisation, is seen to be the root cause of the \nproblems evident in rural areas ranging from rampant consumerism to environmental decline, \nrising inequalities, and social decay. So we have, for example, Chuchai Supawong stating, \nduring the economic crisis that \u2015communities are the heart and the answer [to the economic \nmalaise]. If they are strong, the country will survive\u2016 (Bangkok Post, 1998). Bello et al.\u2018s \nanalysis of Thailand\u2018s \u2017tragedy\u2018 also dwells on the destructive way in which the city has \ninsinuated its way into rural society (1998, pp. 135-138).  \nIt is important to recognise that while the geographical focus of this New Localism is \nsquarely on rural areas, rural society and rural production, it has its origins in the \nimaginations, ideas and ideologies of a largely urban-based, middle class. It also incorporates \na nationalist agenda, sometimes explicit and sometimes tacit, that links the decline of rural \nareas, society and production to Thailand\u2018s incorporation into the global context and, more \nparticularly, to the role of multinational corporations, the IMF and the World Bank (see \nHewison 2001).\n8\n There is, perhaps inevitably, a good deal of confusion \u2013 or at least \ndifference of opinion \u2013 over what \u2017self-sufficiency\u2018 and \u2017self-reliance\u2018 mean in the context of \nthe localism discourse. Some see it in absolutist, almost anarchic terms: self-sufficiency and \nself-reliance at the level of the village and the more, it would seem, the better (see the \ndiscussion, for example, in Chatthip Nartsupha 1991). Other, more pragmatic observers (and \nthe King can be counted one of these, as can Pasuk Phongpaichit and Baker 2000), merely \ncall for a greater consideration of local resources, technologies and capabilities where \u2017local\u2018 \ncan mean, as appropriate, the village, sub-district, district or province, up to the national \nscale. Another theme in the writings of these more moderate localists is their call for a \n\u2017moral\u2018 market to replace the amorality of the capitalist system. \nIt would be wrong to write that there has been no reaction from Thais against either \nChatthip\u2018s interpretation of the past (and implied model for the future) or the King\u2018s proposal \nas to the best way forward. But it is notable that most of the intellectual challenge has come \nfrom Western scholars writing in English. Historians, economists, anthropologists, rural \nsociologists and geographers have questioned whether villages were ever self-reliant and \nsubsistence-oriented, whether they could be characterised as \u2017moral\u2018 economies, and whether \nthey were corporate and egalitarian (see Terweil, 1989; Bowie, 1992; Koizumi, 1992; \nVandergeest, 1991; Rigg, 1994). Indeed some have questioned whether the \u2017village\u2018, as an \nindentifiable unit, ever existed at all until the administrative reforms of the early 20\nth\n century \n(Kemp, 1988; 1989; 1991; Hoadley and Gunnarsson, 1996; Rigg, 1994). Critical comment on \nthe New Localism has also been concentrated among Western scholars (see, for example, \nHewison 2001). \nBut while some academics may have challenged the entrenched views of rural history \nand society, there is an ingrained belief held among rural (and urban) people in Thailand that \nthese two groups of people \u2013 country dwellers and urbanites \u2013 are different. Mills, for \nexample, quotes a textile factory worker from the countryside living in Bangkok:  \n \nS:\\Staff\\DRO - Durham Research Online\\FullText\\Departments\\Geography\\1271\\Journal Rural \nStudies 2002 Production and consumption in Thailand.docx \n6 \n\u2015People in the city and people in the village aren\u2018t the same. City people, Bangkok \npeople, you can\u2018t trust them, they only think of themselves. In the city people don\u2018t \nknow each other. I\u2018ve lived in this room for many months now and I still don\u2018t know the \nneighbors. In the village, I know everyone. We grow up together, we\u2018re all relatives and \nfriends together. I know where they come from, their background. I can trust them.\u2016 \n(Mills, 1997, p. 48).  \n \nIn saying the above, Mills\u2018 textile worker is tapping into this rich seam of tradition and \npropaganda regarding how Thais think about themselves and their country. Nor is this just \nembedded in the popular imagination. As noted above, it is also part-and-parcel of academic \nand political debate, it is reflected in Thai literature, in newspaper articles, and has become a \nguiding principal of the development efforts of Thai NGO activists. From their earliest years \nin school, when children are taught that farmers are the \u2017backbone\u2018 of the nation, the special \ncharacter of farmers, farming and rural areas is stressed. \n \nAs will have become clear from the tenor of this discussion, we are doubtful whether these \nvisions truly offer a realistic alternative to the present trajectory of change in Thailand, even \nin the aftermath of the Asian crisis. In this sense we are more inclined to side with the views \nof Thai scholars such as Ji Ungpakorn who see such visions as utopian and, ultimately, na\u00efve \n(see Reynolds, 2001). \nThere is not space here to explain more than briefly why we take this position. \nHowever, and in summary: we have doubts about the historical veracity of these visions; the \nabsorption capacity of rural areas and agriculture; about the desire among \u2017ordinary\u2018 people \nto re-embrace farming and tradition; and, indeed, about the interpretation placed on the \nlivelihood-effects of the Asian crisis. There is no doubt that rural areas of Thailand did \nbecome a \u2017safety valve\u2018 for some individuals and households but this hardly amounted to a \nfundamental transformation in the trajectory of change, or in the evolving patterns of \nlivelihood in the countryside. Rather than going \u2017back to the roots\u2018, marginal rural \nhouseholds coped with the crisis by cutting back on consumption expenditure, economising, \nselling assets and drawing on their savings, and by desperately searching for alternative non-\nfarm work, perhaps in the informal sector or in small-scale enterprises. They may even have \ntried to squeeze just a little more production and income from their farms by raising labour \ninputs or changing crops or crop mixes. But the notion that they could return to their (often \nsub-livelihood) land holdings just was not an option in the majority of cases (for discussions \nof rural Thailand during the crisis see Rigg, 2002; Rigg and Sakunee Nattapoolwat, 2001; \nWorld Bank, 1999, 2000; Parnwell, 2002). \n \nConsuming imaginations \nThe discussion so far has focused on how the past has been used by radical development \nworkers and academics \u2013 and with the crisis, many mainstream commentators too, including \nthe King of Thailand \u2013 to arrive at a more sensitive, sustainable and appropriate (all key \nwords in the alternative development lexicon) future for the Thai countryside. But there is a \nsecond area where notions of the rural idyll have found fertile ground: in terms of the \nconsumption of rural spaces. It is to this theme that we now turn. \nNotions of the rural idyll, as noted above, are primarily articulated by urban-based, \nand usually middle class academics, journalists and politicians (as in the West). The Thai \nintelligentsia, in other words. As these people, or their acolytes, colonise the countryside they \nare armed with this vision of the past. Housing estates are collectively called mubaan or \n\u2017villages\u2018; hotels draw on the past in their promotional literature and in their architecture; \neven expensive preparatory schools for Thailand\u2018s elite self-consciously model themselves \non this imagined past. In these ways, the past is being used by non-traditional rural classes to \njustify their presence and to make themselves, in a sense, more traditional and more authentic \nthan the farmers who they are, in some cases, displacing from the countryside (see below). \nThe irony is that these new rural residents can, at times, serve to undermine the farm \neconomy. Just as in the developed world, visions of the rural past tend to be selectively \nS:\\Staff\\DRO - Durham Research Online\\FullText\\Departments\\Geography\\1271\\Journal Rural \nStudies 2002 Production and consumption in Thailand.docx \n7 \nembraced by new rural classes to build what they believe is a better, and a more authentic \nrurality. \n However it is not only elites who have turned to tradition to meet contemporary ends. \nThe tourist industry in Thailand, and especially that element geared to taking tourists to visit \nthe hill \u2017tribes\u2018 of the north, rests on maintaining \u2017authenticity\u2018 in the face of rapid and deep-\nseated economic and social change. Hill peoples fully recognise that their tourist value is \nembedded in maintaining tradition \u2013 even if it is a fiction \u2013 even while the industry generates \nthe funds that permit such people to escape tradition and embrace modernity. \n \nThe invasion of the countryside \nThe infiltration of new classes into the countryside, while still not yet a process which has \ngeneral currency, is sufficiently pronounced and well advanced in Thailand to be worthy of \nstudy. The kingdom\u2018s economic boom, rapidly improving transport facilities, and the sense \nthat the quality of life in urban areas has deteriorated along with the environment, led many \nof the country\u2018s new middle classes in the 1990s to seek to live out of town. Around Bangkok \nand regional centres like Chiang Mai and Korat (Nakhon Ratchasima), rural housing estates \nhave colonised the countryside. Following in the wake of the housing estates have come \nshopping centres, schools, recreational facilities and hotels. The result has been, in some \nareas, a fundamental restructuring of rural areas and rural economies. Farmers, enticed by \noffers that were simply too good to turn down, sold their land to property developers. Either \nthey took the money and ran \u2013 to re-establish themselves in more peripheral locations where \nagricultural land was cheaper \u2013 or stayed put and found non-farm work and\/or lived off their \ncapital. Ban Lek, for example, saw land prices escalate by 2,300% as it was drawn within the \norbit of the city of Chiang Mai (Ritchie, 1993, 1996a; 1996b). In the mid-1970s when the \nJapanese scholar Shigeharu Tanabe worked in Ban Lek it was a village of farmers (Tanabe, \n1994) with almost nine in ten households engaged, primarily, in farming. By the early 1990s \nthose engaged in agriculture were in a minority and those whose primary source of livelihood \nwas farming represented an even smaller share of the total. As Ritchie writes: \u2015Although the \nvillage is in a rural setting, the people and households who are involved in agriculture are in \nthe minority\u2016 (1996b, pp. 123-126). Today there are more than a few rural villages around \ncities like Chiang Mai where agriculture is so thinly represented as to be almost invisible. \nOne such \u2017village\u2018 is Mae Sa. \n Anchalee Singhanetra-Renard\u2018s research in Mae Sa, a village in the Mae Sa valley \nnorth of Chiang Mai, dates back over 22 years (see Singahentra-Renard, 1999). In the mid-\n1970s, when she started work in the area her chosen study site was a classic Northern Thai \nfarming community. Households grew glutinous rice to meet their subsistence needs, \ncultivated a small array of cash crops, and engaged in a limited amount of off-farm work to \nsupplement their incomes. The focus of village economy and society was on agriculture and \nfarming. However, being just 13 kilometres from Chiang Mai it wasn\u2018t long before land \nagents began (metaphorically) to knock on people\u2018s doors in Mae Sa. From their first tentative \nvisits in the late 1970s, by the mid-1980s land buying had become \u2017massive\u2018. In 1993 the last \nvillage rice field was sold. In the space of less than two decades, Mae Sa had made the \ntransition from farm to non-farm. Today, except for a few local shopkeepers, everyone makes \ntheir living beyond the village. \u2015Within a 15-kilometres radius of the village\u2016, Singhanetra-\nRenard writes, \u2015there are golf courses, reservoirs, and elephant shows; orchid, butterfly and \nsnake farms; restaurants, five-star hotels, karaoke bars, brothels, massage parlour and \nresorts\u2026\u2016 (1999, p. 77). \nThere is considerable circumstantial evidence to indicate that these transformations, \nrelatively minor though they might be at the moment in terms of the totality of the Thai \ncountryside, are having negative impacts on some rural people and on agricultural \nproduction. The increase in land prices as land speculators buy up choice plots near main \nroads may bring large returns to some, but it is making it difficult for the young to remain in \nfarming, even should they so wish.\n9\n Furthermore, land speculation has led to an increase in \nidle land which provides a habitat where pests can multiply. At the same time the \nconstruction of housing estates in agricultural areas, along with a significant expansion in \nS:\\Staff\\DRO - Durham Research Online\\FullText\\Departments\\Geography\\1271\\Journal Rural \nStudies 2002 Production and consumption in Thailand.docx \n8 \nindustrial activities in rural spaces, has disturbed drainage patterns and increased the \ndischarge of effluent into water courses that, often, feed rice fields and fish ponds. Around \nChiang Mai and other cities, the building of massive ring roads circling the city are \ndisplacing rice fields directly by their construction and also in practice by cutting villagers off \nfrom their land. More damaging still, the roads act as enormous berms, blocking the natural \nflow of water across the fields in the rainy season, causing flooding in areas where water \nwould otherwise naturally drain away. There is also evidence \u2013 reflected in scores of \nnewspaper articles \u2013 of the land conflicts that have emerged as wealth and political power \nhave been used by non-rural classes to colonise and take control of the countryside. In tourist \nresorts this has often been linked to valuable coastal land, while in villages around fast-\ngrowing urban centres it has more usually be associated with land for housing estates.\n10\n \nIn many villages, and remarkably, these changes are not viewed, necessarily, in \nnegative terms because agriculture is increasingly seen as an occupation with little to \nrecommend it, whether economically (low returns) or culturally (low status). Therefore the \ndecline in agricultural output may be considered a price worth paying if it also leads to an \nincrease in local non-farm employment opportunities. Farmers, always ingenious, also find \nways to productively harness the roads that now snake their way through the countryside. For \nexample, recently harvested rice and garlic and peppers are spread out on the tarmac to dry. \nNonetheless it is possible to argue that the interpenetration of non-farm activities and non-\nfarm people into rural areas is having negative ramifications for agriculture. \n There is an important issue of the degree to which the inter-penetration of rural and \nurban spaces is undermining agriculture whether through neglect or positive environmental \ndecline. However rather than examine this significant issue the paper now turns to explore \nthe links between the facilities and recreational activities listed by Singhanetra-Renard and \nnoted above, and the visions of the rural past outlined in the earlier portion of the paper. The \nhotels and elephant camps, even the housing estates and some schools, embed their presence \nin the countryside by specific reference to a constructed past. In this way, we suggest, \nauthenticity comes from an often ideologically-driven imagining of history. Furthermore, the \neffects of this process of material infiltration and cognitive colonisation has sometimes been \ndestructive for the \u2017true\u2018 \u2013 and now endangered \u2013 residents of such rural areas. \n Perhaps the finest example of how new activities in rural areas have constructed and \nreworked \u2013 both mentally and materially \u2013 the countryside to create new economic niches for \nproduction and colonisation is the Regent Hotel. A second case study presented here to \nillustrate the processes of change underway in (some parts of) the countryside is the Tridos \nSchool. In this instance we are more intent on showing how, while such projects explicitly \ndraw on \u2017tradition\u2018 to justify and give meaning to their presence in the countryside, they are, \nat the same time also insulated from the \u2017real\u2018 rural Thailand. Indeed, as we explain, the \neffects of such investments may be fundamentally inimical to the interests of ordinary rural \ndwellers.\n11\n \n \nThe Regent Hotel: consuming the past \nThe Regent Chiang Mai (figure 1) is a hotel where modern amenities and 21\nst\n century \nluxuries are hidden behind a carefully constructed traditional veneer. As Jean Bond Rafferty \nenthuses in her review for Town and Country (December 1997) \u2015staying here is a bit like \ntaking a graceful step back into the 700-year-old history of the fabled Lanna kingdom\u2026\u2016 The \nlinking of this luxury tourist haven with tradition was an explicit aim of Thai architect \nChulathat Kitibutre who \u2015brought an understanding of rural life to the project\u2016, even equating \nthe hotel\u2018s lobby with the village monastery, \u2015the core of daily life\u2016 (Carroll, 1995). Like all \nhotels that want to demonstrate their local credentials, The Regent emphasises the \ncontribution it makes to the local economy from the use of local artisans and materials in the \nconstruction of the hotel through to its employees and working rice farm. A great deal of play \nis also made of the hotel\u2018s \u2017green\u2018 policies (designed by \u2017devout conservationist\u2018 Chulathat \nKitibutre to be as \u2017eco-friendly as possible\u2018) and involvement with local community projects. \nPerhaps the most dramatic reorientation of agriculture in the whole of the North is \nThe Regent Hotel\u2018s \u2017working rice farm\u2018. Consisting of just two dozen or so rice fields set in a \nS:\\Staff\\DRO - Durham Research Online\\FullText\\Departments\\Geography\\1271\\Journal Rural \nStudies 2002 Production and consumption in Thailand.docx \n9 \nsmall bowl below the hotel, which is itself in the Mae Sa Valley about 25 kilometres north of \nChiang Mai,\n12\n this is agriculture re-engineered for the edification of the hotel\u2018s pampered \nguests (figure 2). Looking out from the terrace or pool, a visitor might believe that this is a \nhotel parachuted into an area of traditional rice cultivation. The hotel\u2018s publicity material \ntalks of rice fields watered by an \u2017ancient\u2018 irrigation system, as if the hotel and its guests are \nmere spectators in some age-old agricultural performance. The concept of the resort is \u2015as old \nas the ancient kingdom of Lanna, an agricultural empire unified in the thirteenth century \nunder King Mengrai\u2016 (Carroll, 1995).13 \nCloser inspection reveals a number of peculiar facets of production. To begin with, \nthe rice is always at different stages of maturity from recently transplanted to ready for \nharvesting. Furthermore, the rice fields are not prepared using a rotavator, as they are \nvirtually throughout the north, but with buffalo \u2013 animals that are almost extinct in this area \nof the country. Another odd feature of rice growing is that the transplanted rice is spaced too \nwidely. Finally, the rice fields are irrigated year-round even though there is no obvious way \nthat gravity irrigation could feed the paddys. \nWhile on the surface rice farming here is paraded as \u2017traditional\u2018, the basis and \njustification for the farm is fundamentally different: it is structured, directed and engineered \nwith consumption in mind, not production. It is contrived. The spacing of the rice plants is \nintentionally wide so that the hotel\u2018s guests can see the reflections of the sky in the standing \nwater, especially at sunset. The cultivation of different fields at different times allows visitors \nto see rice at different stages of maturity. It also explains why the rice variety Suphanburi 90 \nis used \u2013 a non-photoperiod sensitive rice that can be planted at any time of year and takes \n120 days to reach maturity. The rice is harvested about once every 40 days \u2013 using a sickle \nand not a mechanical harvester \u2013 or nearly ten times a year. The use of buffaloes rather than \nmechanical methods of land preparation permits the image of bucolic peace and serenity to \nbe maintained. No guest paying upwards of US$300 a night would wish to be disturbed by a \nrotavator. Even the irrigation system is constructed to maintain the image of the traditional. \nWater from a small lake at the foot of the amphitheatre of rice fields is pumped up to a pond \nsituated at the top of the fields which then overflows into a network of channels taking the \nwater through the rice fields and back to the lake again. The rice is grown using some \nchemical and organic fertilisers but no pesticides or herbicides. The average yield is reported \nto be 6,370 kg\/ha (a little less but broadly in line with average yields of second rice [ie \nirrigated rice] in the country as a whole ) and the harvested rice \u2013 which must be the most \nexpensively produced in the country \u2013 is donated to one of the Royal Projects. \nThis bio-physical engineering of rice agriculture also extends into the human realm. \nThe workers on The Regent\u2018s fields wear the mor hom \u2013 traditional indigo-dyed cotton \ntrousers and jackets. These have become symbolic of Thailand\u2018s lost rural innocence. \nPolitically correct academics and NGO workers wear these clothes to demonstrate their \nsolidarity with the peasant masses. Right-on tourists can also buy the garments \u2013 and, no \ndoubt, tuck them away in some bottom drawer when they get home. But no farmer wears the \nmor hom; except, of course, those working on The Regent\u2018s fields. The workers come from \nthe nearby village of Baan Huai Cho and are paid a daily wage much like any other farm \nlabourers. They wear their mor hom uniform to work The Regent\u2018s rice fields, and then slip \non T-shirt and shorts when they get home. \nThe Regent\u2018s artistic manipulation of nature and farming is clearly not going to lead \nto a fundamental transformation in the regional economy. It is only a handful of fields, after \nall.\n14\n But it does show how traditional agriculture is being adapted to meet the demands of a \nnew rural economy. This is production transformed into a performance carefully \nchoreographed for consumption by (largely) foreign visitors. It is also redolent with the \nsymbolism of the past from the mor hom to the buffaloes. In addition, The Regent shows how \nurban Thais conceptualize the rural, as the owners and designers (both Thai and farang) \ndesigned the \u2017rural\u2018 experience for the consumption of others \u2014 a mythic past performed as a \npageant (much like the laser light shows of \u2017ancient\u2018 Sukhothai) \u2014 with little connection to \nthe reality of subsistence rice farming. As an indicator of just how successful this pageant is, \nall of the guests (ten) interviewed by one of the authors believed it was an authentic working \nS:\\Staff\\DRO - Durham Research Online\\FullText\\Departments\\Geography\\1271\\Journal Rural \nStudies 2002 Production and consumption in Thailand.docx \n10 \nfarm, and did not know it was staged.\n15\n \n This case study shows clear links with work in Europe on post-productivist \nagriculture \u2013 only more so. The emphasis on the quality of production, from the cultivation of \n(partially) organic rice to the intentionally anti-mechanical methods employed is in tune with \nthe literature on the restructuring of European agriculture. But the reworking of agriculture so \nthat the means become more important than the ends takes this to a different plane altogether. \nWhether the fields produce 60 kilograms of padi, or 600 kilograms, or 6,000 kilograms is \nbeside the point. It is the consumption of the visual and, to a lesser extent, the aural side-\nproducts of farming which are harnessed here for economic gain. But, and this is an ironic \ntwist in the tale, what have become the side-products in farming Regent-style, namely rice, is \nthen given, gratis, to Thailand\u2018s poor some of whom, one imagines, have been displaced \nfrom their land by just the sort of developments that The Regent represents.  \n \nThe Tridos School: consuming the present, reconstructing the past \nNot far from The Regent Hotel, the Tridos \u2015Three Generation School Village\u2016 was \nconstructed just before the economic crash of 1997. While it has since gone bankrupt and \nbeen bought out by an international school (a saga in and of itself), the school both literally \nand metaphorically consumed the rural countryside and idealized versions of \u2017village\u2018 life.  It \nalso very consciously echoed NGO notions of the countryside as the \u2017real\u2018 repository of \ntraditional Thai values, but recrafted for the consumption of the Bangkok elite. \nThe Tridos School Village (TVS) styled itself as a \u2017three generation\u2018 school \u2013 \ncombining children, parents and grandparents. Harking back to a past when Thai extended \nfamilies lived together, the school\u2018s publicity literature spoke of the three generations living \ntogether in school-provided housing, but with a distinctly modern Thai twist. It described \nparents rushing to \u2015\u2026catch the early morning plane to Bangkok; back to work, congested \nstreets, and polluted air until they can return on Friday\u2016. Mothers were projected catching the \nschool van into town for \u2017an(other) exciting day of shopping\u2018, while the grandparents helped \nthe children with homework. People might not want to leave the \u2017village\u2018 however, as it had \nan outdoor stadium, soccer field, Olympic sized swimming pool, tennis and squash courts, \nhealth spa and other amenities \u2013 including opportunities to learn \u2017traditional\u2018 village crafts. \nRecognizing the challenge of getting parents to leave Bangkok for the North, the founders \nstill hoped they would eventually live at the school full time (TVS Literature, 1997). \nThe Tridos School Village was always referred to as the \u2017School Village\u2018 or just \u2017The \nVillage\u2018 \u2013 explicitly tying the commercial school to a wholly manufactured \u2017village\u2018 \ncommunity. Such was the melding of the real and the imagined Thai rural worlds that it was \nnot immediately clear to one of the authors of this paper which muban (village) the school \nadministrators were referring to \u2013 the \u2017real\u2018 one next door (see below), or the TVS. Unlike an \nactual village which one is born into, entry to the Tridos \u2017village\u2018 required \u2017members\u2018 to pay \na not inconsiderable 3 million baht (US$120,000 at the pre-1997 rate of exchange) deposit \nfor a two bedroom apartment, or 6 million for a four bedroom apartment.\n16\n School fees for \nprimary school were 230,000 baht (US$9,200) annually, and 240,000 baht for secondary \nschool.\n17\n Each family had to pay an additional 60,000 baht a year as well to meet various \nadditional service costs. The school was, both financially and in terms of its ideology, aimed \nat the Thai elite, with a forbidding price tag \u2013 one year\u2018s tuition and boarding was estimated \nby the International Herald Tribune at more than seven times Thailand\u2018s per capita income \nin 1997. \nA core element in the logic and ideology that underpinned the school was to provide \nThailand\u2018s elite with an opportunity to enjoy the \u2015beautiful rural\u2016 land, while \u2015maintaining \ntraditional Thai customs\u2016 that nonetheless were carefully adapted to the rigours of \nglobalization and the demand for a comfortable as well as an authentic rural lifestyle. Both \nthe school literature and teachers at the school spoke of having the highest international \nstandards while maintaining their Thai cultural heritage. Much of the school\u2018s promotional \nliterature played on the fears of Thai parents that their children would lose their \u2015Thainess\u2016 \nand cultural identity if they studied abroad, something that would be avoided by studying at \nthe TVS (International Herald Tribune, February 11, 1997). \nS:\\Staff\\DRO - Durham Research Online\\FullText\\Departments\\Geography\\1271\\Journal Rural \nStudies 2002 Production and consumption in Thailand.docx \n11 \nWhile the Tridos School Village ultimately failed, it presents a very clear illustration \nof the consumption of rural life by Thailand\u2018s urban elite (as opposed to largely overseas \ntourists in The Regent Hotel case study). Located in the North, where land speculation by the \nsame Bangkok elites has displaced hundreds of rural villagers, the Tridos School bought \ntogether Thai notions of family life, an idealized rural village, and fears of cultural \nassimilation in the face of globalisation. Using language harkening back to an idealised past, \npotential students and their families were promised an idealised village setting, but carefully \nmodified and upgraded for a cosmopolitan Bangkok elite \u2013 internet access, air-conditioning, \nsports and spa facilities. The Tridos School Village promised to unite two competing notions \n\u2013 a protected rural lifestyle, where traditional Thai values were preserved, as well as 21st \ncentury education with the latest technology and student-centred teaching methods. The \nmarketing of the rural, and the idealisation of tradition, is part of the TVS story. But we are \nalso interested in exploring the conflicts and tensions that emerged between the Tridos \nSchool Village and the real village next door, Ban Lek. \nBuilt on prime agricultural land near the village of Ban Lek,\n18\n the Tridos School \nVillage not only \u2017consumed\u2018 the countryside and rural notions in its discourses, but also \nconsumed the land physically as well. While the school literature spoke of living in harmony \nwith nature, hiking in the surrounding hills and learning about the environment as an \nessential part of the curriculum and \u2017village\u2018 life, the reality was quite different. The TVS \nwas built right next to the main weir feeding the irrigation canals for Ban Lek. A picturesque \nsetting, \u2017perfect\u2018 for canoeing and other sports, the construction of the school itself, and later \npesticide and herbicide applications to the grounds are blamed by many villagers in Ban Lek \nfor the pollution of one of the main water sources for their rice fields. A traditional feature of \nNorthern Thai agriculture \u2013 a weir and m\u00fcang fai system \u2013 was appropriated by the TVS to \ncreate an idealized setting for the \u2017village\u2018 \u2013 a view of the mountains, and water flowing \nnearby. While the TVS extracted water from the irrigation source, the neo-villagers of the \nTVS did not take part in the traditionally community-based repair and maintenance of the \nm\u00fcang fai system, nor the ceremonies honouring the water spirits (which might explain to \nsome why the school failed). The school in this way, while parading its traditional \ncredentials, in reality undermined rural production, eroded the local productive base, and \ncompromised the social and cultural structures that are part-and-parcel of rural life and \nlivelihoods. \nHeld up as a \u2017lighthouse\u2018 model for Thai education, the administrators and teachers \nat the TVS, as well as the literature, talked about providing a \u2017model\u2018 that other schools could \nuse. The TVS took the standard Thai curriculum, and modified it to be more student-centred, \nand not unrelated, more technologically intensive. When asked about the relevance to the \nneighbouring \u2017real\u2018 village of Ban Lek, the TVS school administrators asserted that the \nschool of Ban Lek could use many ideas from the TVS to improve their students\u2018 education. \nThe headmaster of the school in Ban Lek, however, noted with some irony that since his \nentire annual budget was less than the school fees for one pupil at the TVS, he doubted they \nwould be able to implement any of these tantalising \u2017innovations\u2018. At a time when Ban Lek \nschool teachers were buying chalk out of their own pockets, TVS teachers were enjoying the \nlatest world class instructional technology. While the school at Ban Lek had not a single \ncomputer, TVS students in primary school were to be issued individual laptops. As the TVS \nwas being wired with room to room and desk-to-desk computer networks, the school in Ban \nLek could not even afford a new coat of paint for its lunchroom. \nWhen asked about the relationship with Ban Lek, the administration of the Tridos \nSchool Village promised that their own students would go and teach the local village children \nart classes and other subjects \u2013 perhaps an unintentional natural expression of traditional \nhierarchical patron-client relationships in Thai society. A couple of scholarships were to be \noffered to local village children to attend the TVS, but the impact of the gap between their \nown relative poverty, and the affluence of the TVS was never mentioned. As it turned out, \nthe greatest benefit of the TVS for (real) villagers was in the form of jobs cleaning toilets and \ntending the grounds for the benefit of the few \u2015village members\u2016 of the TVS. \nS:\\Staff\\DRO - Durham Research Online\\FullText\\Departments\\Geography\\1271\\Journal Rural \nStudies 2002 Production and consumption in Thailand.docx \n12 \nWhile The Regent Hotel represents an example of how production, consumption and \nnotions of modern and traditional are reconstructed for people on holiday, the Tridos School \nVillage represents something rather different. While it ultimately failed, the TVS was \nattempting to create an idealized past in the present life of the Bangkok elite. Rather than \nfocusing on consumers of leisure like The Regent Hotel, the market for the TVS was aimed \nat parents who desired a fully modern, yet fully Thai education \u2013 without the problems that \ngo with a congested city like Bangkok, none of the compromises entailed in moving to a real \nvillage, nor the threat of Westernisation by sending a child to study abroad. In trying to create \nthe Tridos Village School, the founder and others took urban Thai notions of what a village \nshould be like, and created it out of the \u2017empty\u2018 rice fields in Chiang Mai. The TVS tried to \ncreate from the ground-up the idealized Thai village, and failed spectacularly to do so. While \nthe countryside was consumed physically, the goal of the production of a viable neo-\ntraditional \u2017village\u2018 ultimately proved elusive. Moreover, while ultimately failing, the TVS \nalso managed to compromise the real village next door, undermining agricultural production \nwhile offering unskilled service sector jobs to poor villagers displaced from the land. \n \nProduction, consumption and imagination: reworking the rural  \nIn the developed world it has become fairly commonplace to write of rural areas making the \ntransition from spheres of production to landscapes of consumption. Processes of counter-\nurbanisation, the de-localisation of work, and the profound structural changes that have \noccurred in rural areas have led to an important re-appraisal of the role and place of rural \nareas in national economies, and of the role of rural studies. Coincident with these changes \nhas come a concern with how the \u2017rural idyll\u2018 has been constructed. \n While these debates are now well embedded in the literature on the developed world, \nthe same cannot be said for studies of the developing world. But, and as we have tried to \nshow with reference to Thailand, it is not the case that rural areas of the developing world \nhave been immune from such processes. Indeed, it can be argued that their presence and \neffects are that much starker and more pronounced because of the rapidity with which such \nchanges are occurring. Studies characteristically show that 10 or even five years can be \nsufficient to transform rural villages from communities where subsistence production and the \nseasonal demands of farming dominate lives and livelihoods to places where life has become \nhighly commodified and where non-farm activities and incomes dominate farming. Scholars \nwho have conducted longitudinal studies characteristically comment on the pace of change \nand their inability to anticipate that change. \n It is important to appreciate that the experience of Thailand, while it does resonate \nwith some aspects of the debate over rural restructuring in the North, is importantly different. \nFurthermore, we would suggest that work on agrarian transitions in the non-Western world \nmore widely gives lie to the view that a single explanatory sequence has general utility (see, \nfor example, Francks et al, 1999 on East Asia; and Bryceson, 1996; Bryceson and Jamal, \n1997; and Bryceson et al., 2000 on Africa). It is not just the pace of transformation \u2013 from \nfarm to non-farm, from subsistence to cash, and from production to consumption \u2013 that is \nremarkable. The bases of these transformations, arguably, are also qualitatively different \nfrom the narrative evident from Western Europe (and, especially, the UK).\n19\n \nTo begin with, households in the South demonstrate an ability \u2013 and a desire \u2013 to \ncreatively combine pre-poductivist, productivist and post-productivist systems. Thus they \nmay simultaneously embrace the subsistence farming of rice (pre-productivist), intensive \nproduction of (say) maize for sale (productivist), and the cultivation of organic vegetables for \nmarket (post-productivist). Bryceson writes of the \u2015enigmatic dual character\u2016 of peasantries \n\u2015as both partially autonomous and highly vulnerable producers\u2016 (2000, p. 300). The \nmainstream literature on rural change seems oddly cosseted from alternative histories of rural \nchange (although see Byres, 1996 for a fine exception) or the ways in which global economic \nchange and local rural change intersect. One of the lessons would seem to be that while even \npeasants are living in the global, agrarian transitions are historically (or, more broadly, \ngeographically) contingent. To quote Bryceson (an Africanist) again: \n \nS:\\Staff\\DRO - Durham Research Online\\FullText\\Departments\\Geography\\1271\\Journal Rural \nStudies 2002 Production and consumption in Thailand.docx \n13 \n\u2015 It is indeed strange that western social science has abandoned the project of tracing \npeasantries\u2018 historical encounter with industrial and post-industrial societies just when \nthis encounter seems to have reached its most critical juncture \u2013 when peasants\u2018 \ncontinuing existence is at stake. Is this the fickleness of academic fashion or an evasive \nguilt complex \u2013 or worse, indifference moulded by the global economy of the affluent?\u2016 \n(2000, p. 322). \n \nSecond, while some of the usual indicators of post-productivism are to be found in the Thai \ncountryside \u2013 the consumption of rural spaces, the increasing presence and role of \nenvironmental NGOs, and on-farm diversification, for example \u2013 the underlying meaning of \nsuch indicators may be very different from that assumed in the Northern (and particularly, \nUK) context. Occupational multiplicity has always played an important part in maintaining \nsustainable livelihoods, and just because we can \u2017tick off\u2018 indicators we should not assume \nthat this means that agrarian transitions in Thailand (or elsewhere in the South) are likely to \nmirror those in the North. This can be exemplified in the case of Laos, neighbouring Thailand \nand one of Asia\u2018s poorest and most \u2017traditional\u2018 countries. Here many farmers use organic \nsystems of agricultural production. However while some farmers can be broadly defined as \npre-productivist and largely subsistence, others are using their organic credentials as a \nmarketing tool to add value to their crops and, in these terms, are post-productivist. Organic \nfarming is seen as one of the few comparative advantages that Laos can sell as it negotiates \nthe transition to the market. The difficulty of applying the post-productivist framework to \nLaos, then, is that the same \u2017indicator\u2018 reflects very different agricultural regimes.20 \nWhile this paper is partly about the shift from farm to non-farm, we have \nendeavoured to link this with a consideration of the construction of the rural in Thailand. For \nwe believe that an understanding of the structural changes sweeping through (some) areas of \nrural Southeast Asia needs to be embedded within the wider debate over the character of the \nrural past and the nature of the rural community. As in the West, the rural idyll has a tight \nhold on the imaginations of many Thais (and non-Thais). Yet there are reasons seriously to \nquestion its veracity (again, as in the West). And while notions of the rural idyll bear more \nthan a passing resemblance to similar debates in Europe, there is, again, a special quality of \nthe discourse in Thailand that needs to be acknowledged. \nFurthermore, not only is it the case that the debate over the Thai rural idyll has its \nown qualities and character; the implications are, if anything, even more important because \nthis debate is not merely an academic and aesthetic one; it has tangible and significant \nimpacts on rural development policy and practice, and on livelihoods. As we have attempted \nto show, the New Localism has the power and potential to transform the way in which the \nstate, and its agents, intervene in rural areas. When an imagined rurality comes into direct \ncontact with the \u2017real\u2018 rural the effects can be (but not necessarily so) deleterious for people \nstriving to make a living in the countryside. In short, the intersection of imagination with \nreality is both academically interesting and practically pertinent. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe fieldwork on which parts of this paper are based was conducted with the permission and \nsupport of the National Research Council of Thailand.

In this paper we see post-productivism in rather wider terms, \nincorporating both agricultural production in rural areas and work in the non-farm sector. \n  \n2\n See Bryceson et al., 2000 for a global developing world perspective. \n \n3\n In other words, there has been a tendency to play down the extent to which non-farm work, whether \nlocal or extra-local, impinges on agricultural practices. This can be seen reflected, for example, in \nabandoned or idle riceland in high population density areas, the rapid spread of some mechanical \ninnovations (like the rotavator), and in changes in cropping pattern. \n  \n4\n The notion of the \u2017righteous\u2018 monarch is well established in the Theravada Buddhist countries of \nSoutheast Asia and also resonates for the Muslim sultanates of island Southeast Asia. While absolute \nmonarchies have long gone from all the territories of the region with the exception of Brunei \nDarrusalam, governments continue to gain legitimacy from being righteous. It can be convincingly \nargued that the reason why the ruling State Peace and Development Council in Burma (Myanmar) has \nlost legitimacy is because its leadership are no longer righteous (see Rigg et al., 1999). The ultimate \ndemise of the SPDC, in Buddhist terms, is sealed. \n \n5\n Although critics have argued that this is exactly what he does. See Hong Lysa 1991. \n \n6\n And in this regard mirrors much of the post-developmental work of scholars such as Arturo Escobar \nand James Ferguson who offer a devastating (but ultimately unconvincing) critique of present \nconditions without suggesting any viable alternative to the existing state of affairs. See Bebbington, \n2000 for a discussion. \n \n7\n It is questionable whether Chatthip was ever concerned with providing a grounded and empirically \ninformed reinterpretation of history.

He is attempting to re-privilege the local over the national, the national over the \ninternational, and culture over economics. \n \n8\n This was given a considerable fillip during Thailand\u2018s economic crisis of 1997-1998 which many \ncommentators saw as a result of Thailand\u2018s overly-intimate engagement with the global economy. \n  \n9\n Which many do not. See Rigg, 2001.  \n \n10\n To see an assortment of such disputes, use the Bangkok Post\u2018s search facility \n(http:\/\/www.bangkokpost.net\/). \n \n11\n Both of these case studies draw on visits by the authors and discussions with local people and those \ninvolved in the two projects. \n \n12\n And close to Anchalee Singhaentra-Renard\u2018s study village. \n \n13\n King Mengrai (r.1259-1317) and King Ramkhamhaeng ruled different Tai kingdoms at the same \ntime and, along with King Ngam Muang of Phayao are said to have sworn a pact of eternal friendship \nin around 1280. \n \n14\n But it is not the only \u2017working farm\u2018 geared to tourists in the area.
