Two case studies of upper mesospheric and lower\nthermospheric (UMLT) high-latitude effects of solar X-ray\nflares are presented. Sodankyla\u00a8 Ion-neutral Chemistry Model\n(SIC) electron density profiles agree with D-region EISCAT\nand riometer observations, provided that the profiles of the\nmost variable ionisable component, nitric oxide, are adjusted\nto compensate for NOx production during preceding geo-\nmagnetically active periods. For the M6-class flare of 27\nApril 2006, following a quiet period, the agreement with cos-\nmic noise absorption observed by the Sodankyla\u00a8 riometers\nwas within reasonable limits without adjustment of the [NO]\nprofile. For the major (X17-class) event of 28 October 2003,\nfollowing high auroral activity and solar proton events, the\nNO concentration had to be increased up to on the order of\n108 cm\u22123 at the D-region minimum. Thus [NO] can in prin-\nciple be measured by combining SIC with observations, if\nthe solar spectral irradiance and particle precipitation are ad-\nequately known.\nAs the two case events were short and modelled for high\nlatitudes, the resulting neutral chemical changes are insignif-\nicant. However, changes in the model ion chemistry occur,\nincluding enhancements of water cluster ions.\nKeywords.

Enell\n(carl-fredrik.enell@sgo.fi)\n1 Introduction\nX-rays are emitted by the hot solar corona and absorbed in\nthe upper and middle atmosphere through direct ionisation\nfollowed by indirect ionisation by the emitted energetic sec-\nondary photoelectrons. The variability of solar emission in\nthis short-wavelength regime is very large. Figures 2 and 8\nshow measurements of hard X-rays, defined here as electro-\nmagnetic radiation of wavelengths shorter than 1 nm, from\nthe GOES Space Environment Monitor X-ray (SEM XRS)\nsensors (Sylwester et al., 1995). It is evident that the ir-\nradiance can vary by 5 orders of magnitude or more. The\nupper-atmospheric effects of X-ray absorption during solar\nflares have been studied by satellites such as TIMED (Woods\net al., 2002) and the Student Nitric Oxide Explorer (SNOE),\n(Bailey et al., 2000). The effects can also readily be mon-\nitored remotely by ground-based instruments. During flare\nevents the electron density in the upper mesosphere \u2013 lower\nthermosphere (UMLT) region is enhanced, which affects the\npropagation of radio waves as measured in HF cosmic noise\nabsorption with riometers as well as with monitoring of VLF\ntransmitters. Based on VLF and riometer measurements,\nThomson et al. (2004) and Brodrick et al. (2005) studied the\nmajor solar flare of 4 November 2003, which saturated the\nGOES detectors. These studies independently concluded that\nthe X-ray flare magnitude was in the range X40\u2013X45, i. e.,\nthe irradiance was 4.0\u20134.5\u00d710\u22123 W m\u22122 in the wavelength\nrange 0.1\u20130.8 nm at 1 AU.\nThe ion and neutral chemical effects of two X-ray flares\nhave here been modelled for the high latitudes of the EIS-\nCAT radar site near Troms\u00f8, Norway (69.59\u25e6 N, 19.23\u25e6 E)\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n2312 C.-F.

The first event,\non 28 October 2003, was a large solar flare preceding the so-\ncalled \u201cHalloween storm\u201d. Several solar proton events also\noccurred during this period (Verronen et al., 2005). The flare\nmagnitude was classified as X17 (maximum irradiance in the\nwide-band GOES XRS detector 17\u00d710\u22124 W m\u22122). During\nthis flare event the EISCAT VHF radar ran the arc dlayer\nexperiment as a UP (Unusual Programme) special event.\nThe second event is the M6 (maximum irradiance\n6\u00d710\u22125 W m\u22122) flare that occurred during the local after-\nnoon and evening of 27 April 2006. The latter case is suitable\nfor comparison and verification especially since the GOES\ndetectors were neither saturated nor much affected by parti-\ncles, which may be the case during X-class events.\nThe rates of hard X-ray ionisation were calculated by fit-\nting a spectral shape to the two GOES hard X-ray channels\nand integrating those over the cross sections of primary ion-\nisation. Secondary ionisation by the X-ray photoelectrons\nwas parameterised. The resulting ionisation rates were im-\nposed on the comprehensive Sodankyla\u00a8 Ion-neutral Chem-\nistry (SIC) model. As will be shown, the resulting electron\ndensity profiles can be forced into agreement EISCAT obser-\nvations by adjusting the initial concentration of nitric oxide\n(NO). For the quiet period of April 2006, the modelled and\nobserved cosmic noise absorptions agree rather well without\nany adjustments of background [NO].\n2 SIC modelling\nIn the modelling of the effects of these two events we have\napplied version 6.8.1 of the SIC model. This model includes\nover 300 reactions of\n\u2013 36 positive ions\n\u2013 27 negative ions\n\u2013 14 neutrals\nand is the result of the extensions of the original Sodankyla\u00a8\nIon Chemistry model (Turunen et al., 1996) as described by\nVerronen (2006). The model uses altitude profiles of tem-\nperature and major atmospheric species from the empirical\nMSISE-90 model (Hedin, 1991) and from Shimazaki (1984).\nPhotoionisation of molecular and atomic oxygen as well as\ndissociation of the molecular major species are calculated\nbased on solar spectral irradiances from the Solar2000 model\n(Tobiska et al., 2000). The radiative transfer calculation fol-\nlows Rees (1989) with numerical integration based on Press\net al. (1992), disregarding refraction for all wavelengths.\nThe spectral region was extended into the hard X-ray\nregion, 0.1\u20131 nm, by including ionisation and dissociation\ncross sections of N2, O2, NO and O (Fig. 1) from the NIST\nXCOM database (Berger et al., 1998). For solar hard X-\nray spectra, many empirical models are nowadays becom-\ning available, such as the Solar Irradiance Platform that is to\nreplace the current Solar2000 (Tobiska et al., 2000) model.\nFor the present purpose, however, we used a simple analyti-\ncal approximation (Sect. 3). This procedure will be shown to\nyield results in approximate agreement with observations for\nthe M-class flare. However, the possible choices of spectral\nmodels will affect the results and interpretation with respect\nto the adaptation of [NO] profiles, so a proper representation\nof the solar spectrum is an important issue for further studies.\nFrom the SIC model results, altitude profiles of electron\ndensity are calculated as\nNe(h) =\n36\u2211\ni=1\n[Pi(h)] \u2212\n27\u2211\nj=1\n[Nj (h)] (1)\nwhere the sums represent the total concentrations of the pos-\nitive and negative ions, respectively.\nWhen setting up a new run, the SIC model is initialised\nby repeating a diurnal cycle with photochemical forcing only\nuntil a quasi-steady cycle is obtained. This method provides\ncontrol (background) profiles for comparison of the results as\nwell as initial concentration profiles of all modelled species\nfor the event runs.\n3 Scaling of GOES data\nThe SEM XRS system of each GOES satellite consists of\ntwo ionisation chambers, one of which is filled with argon\nand covers the nominal wavelength range of 0.1\u20130.8 nm, the\nother one xenon-filled and covering the short-wavelength\nrange of 0.05\u20130.4 nm (see Garcia, 1994). To convert the\nfluxes integrated over these channels into spectral irradiances\nAnn. Geophys., 26, 2311\u20132321, 2008 www.ann-geophys.net\/26\/2311\/2008\/\nC.-F. Enell et al.: Case studies of X-ray flares 2313\nfor the modelling, we have applied an empirical spectrum ac-\ncording to Culhane and Acton (1970); in photon energy E\n(keV) scale\nN(E)=C\u00b7T \u22120.2E\u22121.3 exp\n[\n\u2212 E\nkT\n][\n1\u2212\n(\nE\n88.0\n)0.33kT ]\u22121\n(2)\nEquation (2) contains two free parameters, a solar coronal\nplasma temperature T and a constant C representing a line-\nof-sight integral of coronal electron density. k is Boltzmann\u2019s\nconstant. It can thus be numerically fitted to reproduce the\ntwo measurement channels of GOES. For the high X-ray ir-\nradiances of 28 October 2003, Eq. (2) does not hold true,\nsince it is valid for T<20\u00d7106 K only. The wide X-ray\nchannel was also saturated during the maximum. In these\ncases the spectrum for T=20\u00d7106 K was shifted towards\nsmaller wavelengths until the GOES channel ratios matched\nand then C was scaled to reproduce the irradiance(s) of the\nnon-saturated channel(s).\nFor the 27 April 2006 case the maximal irradiances ob-\nserved were lower than the minimal irradiances of the 28\nOctober 2003 event, so Eq. (2) is assumed to be applica-\nble throughout the event. The scaling for this event could\ntherefore be automated and for simplicity we assumed the\nspectral responses of the two ionisation chambers to be Gaus-\nsian with half-widths of 0.1\u20130.8 nm and 0.05\u20130.3 nm, respec-\ntively, the latter because the X-ray ionisation chamber has a\nrather sharp cutoff at 0.3 nm. Although the fitting procedures\ndescribed here are somewhat arbitrary, the spectra obtained\nhave proven to yield results (electron density profiles) well\nin agreement with observations.\n4 Case 1: 28 October 2003\n4.1 Data analysis\nThe left plot of Fig. 2 shows the two 5-min integrated GOES-\n10 SEM X-ray channels for the time of the event. The maxi-\nmum occurred close to local noon. However, in late October\nthe solar elevation is low also at noon \u2013 the solar zenith an-\ngle used in the calculation was close to 83 \u25e6 throughout the\nevent. During the event the EISCAT VHF radar was run-\nning the high-resolution arc_dlayer experiment which is\na pulse-to-pulse long-lag experiment with high time resolu-\ntion for the ranges 60\u2013140 km.\nFor analysing the experiment data, the Fukuyama and\nKofman (1980) (henceforth F-K) theory was fitted to the\nEISCAT autocorrelation function (ACF) profiles using the\nMetropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nmethod (Hastings, 1970). MCMC is a random sampling\nprocedure which automatically yields the posteriori distri-\nbutions of the free parameters. The F-K fit parameters are\nelectron density Ne, electron temperature, ion velocity, ratio\n\u03bb=N\u2212\/Ne of negative ion to electron density, and collision\nfrequency \u03bdin. Since the MCMC method can, by definition,\nyield only results within the given a priori distributions of the\nparameters to fit, wide step-function type prior distributions\nwere used. The calibration factor of the ACF profiles was\nestimated by fitting the first lags of the ACFs to the so-called\nraw Ne (N\u2217e ) profiles given by the standard EISCAT analy-\nsis software GUISDAP1 in the E region. Since ISRs do not\nmeasure the true raw backscattered power (zero lags of the\nACF), GUISDAP calculates the N\u2217e values from the 32-\u00b5s\npseudo-zero lags of the arc_dlayer experiment, automat-\nically calibrating against the foE of the co-located EISCAT\ndynasonde (I. Ha\u00a8ggstro\u00a8m and M. Rietveld, personal commu-\nnication).\n4.2 Modelling\nFor modelling the 28 October 2003 case, the SIC model\nwas initialised for the location of EISCAT at Ramfjordmoen\nnear Troms\u00f8, Norway (69.59\u25e6 N, 19.23\u25e6 E). The MSIS back-\nground atmosphere was calculated with the following param-\neters: F10.7=217.8 (solar 10.7 cm flux of the preceding day),\nF10.7A=164.56 (3-month average of F10.7) and daily average\nAp=22. Calculations of ionisation and dissociation of nitro-\ngen and oxygen were included as in the standard SIC 6.8.1\nmodel and in addition rates due to the fitted hard X-ray spec-\ntra, of which the right plot of Fig. 2 shows two examples,\nwere included. The radiative transfer calculations were up-\ndated with 5-min time resolution together with estimates of\nvertical transport, etc., as described in Verronen (2006).\n4.2.1 Scaling of nitric oxide\nNitric oxide (NO) is the main varying ionisable species in\nthe altitude range of this study. During quiet times, solar\nLyman-\u03b1 ionisation of NO is the main source of the lower\nionosphere. Hard X-rays, as well as auroral electrons and so-\nlar protons, efficiently ionise also the main constituents of the\natmosphere, but we assume their concentrations to be con-\nstant, given by the MSISE-90 background.\nThe odd nitrogen family (NOx=N+NO+NO2) is long-\nlived, the lifetime being from about one day in the solar-\nilluminated upper atmosphere up to months in the polar\nnight. Under such conditions transport of NOx to lower alti-\ntudes and latitudes is important (Siskind et al., 1997; Callis\nand Lambeth, 1998; Vitt et al., 2000; Seppa\u00a8la\u00a8 et al., 2007).\nThe balance between the species is governed by photochem-\nistry, so that most NOx is converted into NO during day-\ntime. The concentration of NO thus depends on transport and\npreceding production by auroral activity and proton events.\n[NO] has a maximum at altitudes between 100 and 120 km,\nwhere both soft X-ray radiation (1\u20137 nm) and auroral elec-\ntron precipitation (assuming typical characteristic energies\nof 1\u201310 keV) dissipate most of their energy. As shown by\nSNOE the concentration of NO around the 110-km peak\nvaries between 107 and 109 cm\u22123 at high latitudes.

(1998); Saetre\net al. (2004) and Saetre et al. (2007) for further discussions\nof these measurements and modelling of NO. We can thus\nexpect a concentration on the order of 109 cm\u22123 in active pe-\nriods.\nTo account for this variability of [NO], the modelled and\nmeasured Ne profiles were brought into agreement by scal-\ning the SIC initial concentrations of nitric oxide at the start\nof the model run (08:00 UT), multiplying by 10, 30 and 100.\nThe model runs were continued without X-ray ionisation un-\ntil 10:45 UT, allowing the numerical solutions to settle to\nNO concentrations acceptably close to the observed range\nat the maximum. The resulting NO concentration profiles at\n10:45 UT are shown in Fig. 3. X-ray ionisation was switched\non at 10:50 UT.\nThe left plot of Fig. 4 shows SIC modelled and\narc_dlayer fitted electron densities for 09:45 UT, which\nwas the time of a minimum in the electron density before the\nflare peak.

On 28 October 2003, SIC modelled [NO] in this\naltitude range was 107\u2013108 cm\u22123, increasing even more\nafter the following \u201cHalloween\u201d events. Taking also au-\nroral electrons into account, a concentration of close to\n109 cm\u22123 as in these cases (Fig. 3) is therefore not unre-\nalistic. The exact shape of the modelled electron density\nprofiles will depend not only on [NO] and the applied\nhard X-ray spectra but also on EUV, soft X-rays and\nparticle precipitation. However, at the time of onset of\nthis event it appears that simultaneous particle precipi-\ntation can be neglected.\n2. Above 100 km: Before the flare onset (Fig. 4) the elec-\ntron density is highly overestimated for the [NO] scal-\ning required for best agreement at 75\u2013100 km. As seen\nin Fig. 3 the model concentration of NO at the max-\nimum near 110 km is close to 109 cm\u22123 or higher for\nall three scaling factors, so this scaling is possibly un-\nrealistic. In that case, interpolation between the pro-\nfiles can in principle be applied to obtain an estimate of\nthe actual NO concentrations. However, part of the dis-\ncrepancy, especially before the flare onset, can also be\ncaused by the simple radiative transfer calculation over-\nestimating soft X-rays and EUV at these altitudes for\nthe high solar zenith angle of the event. This source of\nuncertainty should be eliminated by a proper radiative\ntransfer calculation, but this is beyond the scope of the\npresent study. More likely ionisation by EUV and soft\nX-rays are underestimated at the flare maximum. Soft\nX-rays (>1 nm) and EUV are included as a daily aver-\nage from the SOLAR2000 model (Tobiska et al., 2000).\nThus ionisation by soft X-rays and EUV in the model\nrun does not follow the flare development. In this case\nthe lower concentrations of Fig. 3 are still correct.\n3. Below 75 km: The scattering is affected by the high col-\nlision frequency, by the presence of negative ions, and\npossibly also by radar self-clutter (F-region backscat-\nter from preceding pulses aliased into the lowest\nranges). The latter is significant only below 65 km\n(I. Ha\u00a8ggstro\u00a8m, personal communication). The upper\npanel of Fig. 6 confirms that negative ions are signifi-\ncant below 70 km. The middle plot shows modelled and\nF-K fitted values of the negative ion to electron density\nratio \u03bb for the flare maximum.\nThe GUISDAP and F-K electron density profiles agree\nfairly well in the pre-flare case, but at the flare maxi-\nmum the difference is large. The discrepancy between\nF-K and raw Ne (the latter not shown in the figures)\nis small, however, and attributable to the negative ions.\nTurunen (1993) has shown that the Fukuyama and Kof-\nman (1980) theory represents the effect of negative ions\nwell. As Fig. 7 shows, the difference is likely caused\nby the fact that GUISDAP uses a fixed collision fre-\nquency profile whereas it is a fitted parameter in the F-K\nMCMC retrieval. It can be seen that the F-K fit repro-\nduces the mesopause as a change in the gradient. The\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/2311\/2008\/ Ann. Geophys., 26, 2311\u20132321, 2008\n2316 C.-F.

Proton precipitation probably began around\nthis time (see Verronen et al., 2005), and the short-\nwavelength region of the Culhane and Acton (1970)\nspectrum (Eq. 2) may not be a good representation of\nthe actual solar spectrum, especially since one of the\nGOES detectors was saturated and the spectrum was\nadapted manually. The discrepancy may also be an in-\ndication that it would be necessary to introduce hard-X-\nray ionisation earlier in the model run.\nA narrow polar mesospheric winter echo (PMWE) is\nalso visible at around 60 km. The strength of the PMWE\nappears to follow the X-ray ionisation, which is ex-\npected since both ionisation and some perturbations,\nlikely turbulence (Kero et al., 20082 causing a density\nmodulation fulfilling the Bragg condition at the radar\nwavelength are necessary for producing a strong echo.\nThe lower panel of Fig. 6 shows that the change in ni-\ntric oxide concentration due to the flare is completely neg-\nligible.

Solar flare events affect the entire sunlit\natmosphere and may last for several days. At lower latitudes,\nwhere the background concentration is orders of magnitude\nsmaller due to transport and the absence of particle precipi-\ntation, flares are likely to enhance [NO] significantly.

The maxi-\nmum occurred in the local afternoon and evening, but since\nlate April is close to the beginning of polar day the solar\nelevation was higher than during the 28 October 2003 X17\nevent. In the period 15:00\u201317:00 UT the solar zenith an-\ngle increased from 70\u25e6 to 82\u25e6. The EISCAT radars were\nnot running during the maximum of this flare event, only in\nthe morning and late evening, so comparison with modelling\nwould not be straightforward. Therefore we restrict this\nstudy to a comparison with riometer measurements. Figure 8\nshows the X-ray fluxes measured by the GOES 10 satellite\nduring 27 April 2006.

Comparison of the fixed ion-neutral collision frequency\nprofile of GUISDAP, calculated from MSIS N2, O2 and O, and\nthe Fukuyama-Kofman MCMC fit. The F-K fit reproduces the\nmesopause well whereas the exponential GUISDAP profile, likely\ndiffering from the real one, may cause misinterpretation of the elec-\ntron densities.\nX-ray ionisation. In the EUV region of the solar spectra the\nirradiances were chosen as the maximum (per wavelength\nbin) of the Solar 2000 and the TIMED SEE (Woods et al.,\n2002) empirical spectral models. The EUV irradiances were\nseen to affect the results somewhat, again indicating that us-\ning proper solar spectra and radiative transfer calculations is\nimportant for the interpretation of the results. Updates of the\nX-ray spectra and vertical transport were calculated for each\nminute and the MSIS background was updated for each 5-\nmin interval.\nIn the upper panel of Fig. 9 the development of the SIC\ncalculated electron density during the event is presented.\nFrom the profiles of electron-neutral collision frequencies,\ngiven by an empirical function of temperature, Ne and the\nconcentrations of N2, O2, O and He (Banks and Kockarts,\n1973), the absorption of radio noise is calculated using the\nextended magneto-ionic theory of Sen and Wyller (1960),\nfollowing Hultqvist (1968). A pure dipole approximation\nof the geomagnetic field at Sodankyla\u00a8, magnetic latitude\n63.8\u25e6 N, was adopted. Figure 10 shows the calculated and\nobserved absorptions from the two Sodankyla\u00a8 riometers at\n30 and 51.4 MHz. The modelled absorptions in dB were\ncalculated for an isotropic wide-beam zenith geometry and\ntherefore multiplied by a geometrical factor G=1.2.\nThe observed and modelled absorptions agree fairly well\nduring the flare. The base level of the observation is higher\nthan the modelled absorption due to the absorption at higher\naltitudes (see e.g. Ranta, 1979) not taken into account here.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/2311\/2008\/ Ann.

Right plot: Fitted Culhane and\nActon (1970) spectra for the maximum and minimum fluxes during the model run. Spectra fitted to 5-min average GOES data were used\nthroughout the flare runs.\nNeither did our modelling take into account D-region ionisa-\ntion by electron precipitation. After approximately 17:00 UT\n(not shown here) the observed absorption increased above\nthe modelled absorption. This was due to auroral activity as\nevident from inspection of magnetograms. Riometers show-\ning an increase in cosmic noise absorption therefore cannot\nper se be used to distinguish between the effects of X-rays\nand precipitating particles. Direct or indirect measurements\nof particle precipitation is a necessary complement for inter-\npreting the source of absorption enhancements.\nThe middle panel of Fig. 9 shows that the ratio of negative\nions to free electrons reaches 0.1 at well below 80 km also in\nthis case. The lower panel shows an example of water clus-\nter ions (here a proton hydrate). It is seen that water cluster\nion concentrations can increase by some orders of magni-\ntude close to the mesopause. All excess ionisation, also by\nhard X-rays, could therefore play a role in the formation of\naerosols in the mesopause region, affecting the occurrence\nof polar mesospheric summer echoes and noctilucent clouds\nduring short-term events.\n6 Discussion\nThe ion-neutral chemical model results of the 28 October\n2003 X17 and 27 April 2006 M6 flares were compared with\nD-region radio observations. For the 27 April 2006 flare,\nthe cosmic noise absorption calculated from SIC model Ne\nprofiles agree at least qualitatively with riometer measure-\nments without any adjustments. The background atmosphere\nas given by MSIS is likely more reliable for this latter case.\nMSIS interpolates profiles taking into account average Ap\nand F10.7 above 100 km. The solar elevation was also rather\nhigh during the onset of this event, so the calculation of pho-\ntoionisation should work without major problems.\nIn the 28 October 2003 case, preceding auroral activity\nand proton precipitation have evidently enhanced the [NO]\nbackground in the upper mesosphere up to 108\u2013109 cm\u22123.\nAs seen in Figs. 4 and 5 the pre-flare result above 110 km fits\nmeasurements without any scaling of the initial [NO] profile,\nwhereas at the flare maximum the resulting electron density\nis too low. This is possibly due to underestimated soft X-ray\nfluxes. As mentioned, the issues of proper radiative transfer\nat high solar zenith angles also needs further investigation,\nsince overestimates of the ionisation rates may instead follow\nand therefore the higher [NO] values may still be correct.\nNeutral chemistry changes are insignificant in these short-\nlived high-latitude events, but further model studies will ad-\ndress the importance at low latitudes. Finally it should be\nnoted that effect of heating on atmospheric dynamics during\nflares is also very likely of major importance, rendering the\nMSISE-90 model values unreliable, but this is beyond the\nscope of this paper. We plan to address these questions by\napplying a version of the CMAT2 three-dimensional model\n(Harris, 2001) where the radiative code has been extended\ninto the hard-X-ray range (A. Dobbin and A. Aylward, per-\nsonal communication).\n7 Conclusions\nThe SIC model has been extended for modelling the ef-\nfects of solar hard X-rays. The effects on ion chemistry are\nAnn.

It would therefore be desirable to verify the proposed\nmethod by comparison with in-situ measurements of [NO]\nduring flare events. The calibration of the electron density\nprofiles and measured cosmic noise absorption is also impor-\ntant. Methods for obtaining accurate calibrations of EISCAT\ndata even during times of strong ionisation, when ionosonde\nmeasurements of foE are impossible due to D-layer absorp-\ntion and F-region clutter can affect the measurements, would\nbe needed.\n[NOx] and thus daytime [NO] is highly variable. At\nUMLT altitudes, where [NO] profiles normally have a min-\nimum at 70\u201380 km, preceding auroral activity and proton\nevents may enhance [NO] by one to a few orders of mag-\nnitude. Such a scaling of [NO], i.e. total [NO] in the range\n108\u2013109 cm\u22123, brings modelled and measured electron den-\nsity profiles into agreement at these altitudes. We can there-\nfore conclude with some confidence that the concentration\nwas at least 108 cm\u22123 there. Closer to the [NO] maximum\naround 110 km a smaller scaling factor must likely be used.\nThe combination of modelling based on measured or ad-\nequately parameterised solar spectra (and energies of pre-\ncipitating particles) with incoherent scatter radar or riome-\nter measurements thus provides a method for remote sensing\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/2311\/2008\/ Ann.
