Small and Medium sized Tourism accommodation Enterprises \n(SMTEs)  \n \nIn every European country small, independent and flexible accommodation \nestablishments dominate the market, and play a vital role not only in structural terms but \nalso in terms of contribution to national and European GDP and to tourism employment. \nSMTEs provide a very diverse range of tourism products and services, facilitate rapid \ninfusion of tourism spending into local economies, while in leisure tourism they usually \nshoulder the distinctive function to offer a local character to the increasingly \nhomogenised tourism packages. In total, it is estimated that more than 90 per cent of all \nEuropean hotels are SMTEs and are family managed (Shaw and Williams, 1990; Go \nand Welch, 1991; Sheldon, 1993; Buhalis and Cooper, 1992, 1998; European \nCommission, 2002i). This is particularly the case in the Mediterranean basin, as a result \nof market characteristics (mainstream leisure tourism product offered), socio-cultural \ncharacteristics (long tradition of tourism as an industry; role and appreciation of \nfamily\u2019s tights and property; entrepreneurial population), and geographical \ncharacteristics (numerous small islands and communities; destinations\u2019 development at \ndissimilar stages with SMTEs pioneering development) that have all reinforced the \ntrend towards small and family owned accommodation establishments.  \n \nIn Greece, recent data gathered by the Institute for Tourism Research and Forecasting \n(ITEP, 2001), classified hotels according to their number of rooms and showed that \nSMTEs (defined as hotels with less than 100 rooms) account for 93% of the hotels in \nthe country, while they employ one to sixty persons (Table 1).   \n \n3Table 1: Classification of Greek hotels according to their size (number of rooms) \nSize of \nhotel \nNo of rooms No of hotels % of hotels Average \nemployment \nMaximum \nemployment \nFamily \nhotel \n1-20 3548 43 1.4 10 \nSmall 21-50 3011 37 4.8 25 \nMedium 51-100 1075 13 15.0 60 \nLarge >100 610 7 64.0 210 \nTotal  8244 100 8.8 210 \nSource: I.T.E.P. (Institute for Tourism Research and Forecasting), 2001. \n \nGreek hotels account for a fraction of the total accommodation supply. Depending on \nthe destination, hotels are supplemented by smaller accommodation establishments such \nas rooms to let, self-catering apartments, villas, bungalows, camping etc. This \ndemonstrates a noteworthy fragmentation of the Greek accommodation sector. The E.C. \ndefines as Small or Medium Enterprises all enterprises that occupy less than 250 \nemployees (E.C., 2002ii). If the employment criterion is used to categorise the size of \nenterprises it is safe to assume that the vast majority (perhaps above 99%) of all Greek \naccommodation establishments could be characterised as SMTEs.  \n \nSMTEs share some distinctive characteristics and have certain strategic and functional \nweaknesses that handicap not only their operation and standard of services offered, but \nalso their ability to negotiate their offer optimally. Middleton (1994) argues that \nplanning is particularly important in the tourism industry, where demand is volatile, the \nproduct is perishable and supply demands considerable fixed investment. One of the \ncharacteristics, however, of SMTEs is indeed this lack of planning and strategic vision, \nwith tactical and operational decisions dominating their decision-making (Olsen, 1991; \nBuhalis and Cooper, 1992). Even further, SMTEs are generally weakly managed and \nmarketed, since they lack the resources on the one hand to occupy specialised \npersonnel, on the other hand to promote themselves adequately. These weaknesses \n4coupled with the lack of basic business information force most SMTEs to adopt a \n\u201cproduct oriented\u201d than a \u201cmarket oriented\u201d approach in their tourism offer (Buhalis, \n1992). By that, SMTEs become the \u201cweakest link\u201d within the distribution channel, and \nthe dependency on intermediaries becomes unavoidable.  \n2. Distribution channels, European Tour Operators (TOs) and \nSMTEs  \n \nW.T.O. in 1975 suggested that \u201ca distribution channel can be described as a given \ncombination of intermediaries who co-operate in the sale of a product. It follows that a \ndistribution system can be and in most instances is composed of more than one \ndistribution channel, each of which operates parallel to or in competition with other \nchannels\u201d. By then many scholars have attempted to provide an adequate definition, that \nincorporates all the existing elements and functions of tourism distribution channels \n(Mill and Morrison, 1985; Middleton, 1994; Buhalis, 2001). Summarily from their \ndefinitions, tourism distribution channels could be regarded as the organised and \nserviced systems that undertake the responsibility to bundle tourism products together \nand promote them; provide information for prospective tourists; and also establish \nmechanisms that enable consumers to make, confirm and pay for reservations. As far as \nit concerns the role of intermediaries within these channels Wanhill (1998) argued \u201cthe \nprincipal role of intermediaries is to bring buyers and sellers together, either to create \nmarkets where they previously did nor exist or to make existing markets work more \nefficiently and thereby to expand their market size\u201d. Nowadays, tourism distribution \nchannels increasingly develop into one of the most critical factors that determine the \noverall competitiveness and prosperity of tourism destinations and suppliers \n(Christopher, 1991; Stern, El-Ansary and Coughlan, 1996). Distribution channels often \ninfluence the behaviour of the consumer, and they effectively determine whether \ndestinations and local suppliers can be included in the set of decision-making models of \nprospective consumers (W.T.O., 1975; Buhalis, 2001). Especially, in tourism the \ndistribution element is much more important than in other trade industries. As \nMiddleton (1994, p.201) argued \u201cparadoxically, the inability in travel and tourism to \ncreate physical stocks of products, adds rather than reduces the importance of the \ndistribution process. In marketing practice, creating and manipulating access for \n5consumers is one of the principal ways to manage demand for highly perishable \nproducts\u201d. \n \n2.1 Tourism distribution channels for European leisure tourism \n \nIn contemporary European leisure tourism environment, \u201cpackaged\u201d travel is the \npredominant form of tourism activity (Buhalis and Laws, 2001). The unquestionable \nchannel leaders are the large integrated travel organisations that have been formed by \nNorthern-European tour operators (Josephides, 1994; Renshaw, 1994; O\u2019Brien, 1996, \n1998; Monopolies and Mergers Commission, 1997; Bywater, 1992, 1997, 2001; \nIoannides & Debbage, 1998). These gigantic travel organisations have already achieved \na remarkable vertical growth, by integrating into their core tour operating business \ntransportation services (charter airlines) and travel retailing through the acquisition of or \nco-operation with major outgoing travel agency chains. In recent years TOs\u2019 \nconcentration approach has been expanded to destination areas as well. Large TOs \nmerge with, acquire or develop accommodation establishments and incoming tour and \ncoach operators. For these large consortiums the only feasible way to sustain their \nbusiness and earn profits is to standardise their \u201cpackages\u201d, follow a \u201chigh volume-low \ncost-low profit margin\u201d strategy in their product offering. Hence, they compete with \neach other primarily on the ground of market share.  \n \n2.2 Issues emerging from concentration in the European tour \noperating industry for SMTEs \n \nTOs\u2019 accumulated forces have produced signs of oligopoly and unfair trade events in \nthe origin markets (Monopolies and Mergers Commission, 1986, 1997; Cleverdon & \nKalisch, 2000; Hudson, Hudson, Miller & Snaith, 2001, A.B.T.A., 2002), and acute \noligopsonistic phenomena for the destination\u2019s suppliers. For instance, the British \nmarket, which is one of the main generators of intra-European leisure tourism flows, \nexperiences a marked polarisation in the tour operation industry (Bywater, 2001; Evans, \n2001). Specifically, four out of 1444 fully bonded British TOs control: 53 per cent of \nthe licensed charter flight capacity (C.A.A., 2001); more than 60 per cent of the fully \n6bonded licensed capacity (Evans, 2001); 40% of High-Streets\u2019 retail outlets and \ninfluence over 70% of them (A.B.T.A., 2002).  \n \nAs far as it concerns the Mediterranean destinations under study, a European \nCommission report issued in 2000 stated \u201cthe four large integrated suppliers already sell \nbetween them, over 90% of all packages to the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands \nand 80% to [most] other significant short-haul summer destinations\u201d (E.C., 2000:15). \nThis can be mainly attributed to the fact that large TOs, through their subsidiaries \ncharter airlines, controlled in 1999 almost 94% of the international charter airline traffic \nfrom the UK in terms of passengers carried (C.A.A., 2000). In Greece, where the field \nstudy took place, statistics reveal that the five largest British TOs control around 70% of \nthe British tourism flows to almost every Greek mass tourism destination (Figure 1).  \n \nFigure 1: Market share of British tour operators in Greece 2001 \nTOUR OPERATOR F\n7.20%\n TOUR OPERATOR D\n11.35%\nTOUR OPERATOR C\n12.41%\nTOUR OPERATOR B\n16.54%\nTOUR OPERATOR A\n17.23%\nTOUR OPERATOR E\n10.90%\nTOUR OPERATOR G\n6.20%\nTOUR OPERATOR H\n5.80%\nOTHERS\n10.34%\nTOUR OPERATOR I\n2.03%\nData obtained by G.N.T.O.-London Branch, (2001). \n \nA similar pattern applies in the other major tourism generating market, namely \nGermany. Three major TO groups dominate the tour operating industry and the German \n\u201cpackaged\u201d outbound leisure market, namely Pressaug (former TUI), REWE Touristik, \nThomas Cook AG (former C&N Touristik) that control a 70% of the market (D.R.V., \n72001). Since 2000, acquisitions of British groups by large German TOs have increased \nthe concentration in the European market even further (Bywater, 2001).  \n \nTOs\u2019 uncontested market power generates -besides the de facto unfavourable \noligopsony situation- many negative phenomena for SMTEs such as conflicts, coercion \nand dependency (Ujma, 2001). The strategic and operational weaknesses of SMTEs, \nalong with intense competition of various forms, assign vast power to the leaders of \ntourism distribution channels. The powerful members of the chain can take advantage of \nthe unfavourable business environment for SMTEs to pressurise them during \ncontractual negotiations. By doing so they aim at reducing SMTEs operational and \nprofit margins, jeopardising at the same time their viability. Buhalis (2000) has \ndemonstrated this role of TOs in packaging and managing tourism products often at the \nexpense of destinations and suppliers. It should also be emphasised that for SMTEs in \nleisure tourism destinations, TOs represent one of the few viable alternatives \u2013and \nindeed the only massive- for gaining visibility in the main generating markets and \nfilling their capacity. Even further, in insular tourism destinations, TOs determine up to \na considerable degree the accessibility options. Therefore, the geographical context of \nthis paper, namely mass tourism Mediterranean islands, provides the ideal background \nfor a thorough study in the relationships between SMTEs and TOs.  \n \n2.3 TOs\u2019 contribution to SMTEs, destinations and consumers \n \nDespite the fact that the role and the business ethics of the large integrated groups of \nEuropean TOs are the source of serious controversy and conflict within the tourism \nchannel, it should be admitted that TOs contribute significantly in the tourism value \nsystem. More specifically, their involvement in the tour package lends considerable \nadvantages by acting complementarily to the value chains of the other channel \nmembers. For instance, according to Britton (1978) hotels began marketing their rooms \nthrough operators when they realised the unprecedented benefit that no sales staff or \nfront-end money was required, and payment was made only for what business had been \nproduced. Also, principals have the ability to sell their perishable product in bulk, and \non the one hand to transfer part of their business risk to the TO on the other hand to \nenhance their medium to long-term planning ability. Additionally, TOs allow the \n8various tourism services\u2019 suppliers to reduce their promotional expenditures, without \ncompromising entirely their representation and visibility in the tourism generating \nmarkets. This is a major opportunity for tourism firms -especially for SMTEs- that lack \nthe required capital and expertise to communicate their offer and attract clientele \nindependently. Additionally, SMTEs do not have to develop and sustain a costly system \nto deal with all their customers\u2019 inquiries and booking details. \n \nYet, the most significant advantages of TOs\u2019 involvement emanate for the consumer, \ndue to convenience and reduced product and transaction costs (Sheldon, 1986; \nIoannides, 1998). In the origin markets TOs can deal with customers more efficiently, \ndue to their common culture and language, while there are also more aware of the \nspecific requirements and characteristics of the local consumers. At the destinations \nTOs also provide a sense of familiarity and security to the \u201cuser\u201d of the service, by \nspeaking \u2013through their destination representatives- the language of the visitor, and by \ncommunicating a clear impression that they are aware of every aspect or detail at the \ndestination. Additionally, they are often the \u201csafeguards\u201d of the quality that will be \nenjoyed by their client in the destination. Undoubtedly, these direct advantages for the \nconsumer benefit indirectly the tourism suppliers and the industry itself, since they \nboost actual tourism demand through the facilitation of packaged travel and the \n\u201cdemocratisation\u201d of international travel.  \n \nMoreover, destinations as entities benefit by TOs through increased accessibility offered \nby charter flights; support in marketing and promotion of the destination area and \nincreased visibility especially in the international marketplace. Additionally, TOs often \nenable the expansion of tourism season by stimulating tourism demand through \npromotions, advertisement and educational trips for the travel agents\u2019 and TOs\u2019 staff. \nFinally, TOs tend to oversee the entire holiday experience by providing representatives, \nand in many cases assess the satisfaction of their clients after their trip. Hence, they \nmonitor the performance of the entire tourism industry and often raise issues with \nD.M.O.s (Destination Management Organisation) towards the improvement of the \ndestinations quality. \n \nFigure 2 below summarises the major advantages that TOs\u2019 involvement lends to the \nother channel members\u2019 value chains. Clearly, their involvement in the packaged travel \n9benefits SMTEs, both directly and indirectly. However, there are also numerous \nsignificant problems and conflicts that arise between these two channel members. \nHence, this paper will next concentrate its interest in examining this challenging co-\noperation. \n \nFigure 2: Contribution of TOs to consumers, destinations, SMTEs  \nConsumers \u2022 Convenience (selling points everywhere) \n\u2022 Reduced price of travel \n\u2022 Reduced cost of transactions and arrangements \n\u2022 Common culture and language \n\u2022 Better understanding of their requirements and characteristics \n\u2022 Familiarity and security in the destination \n\u2022 Guidance and assistance at the destination \n\u2022 Control of the quality enjoyed by consumers \nDestinations \u2022 Increased accessibility \n\u2022 Support in marketing promotion \n\u2022 Increased international visibility\/awareness for the destination \nareas \n\u2022 Extended tourism season \n\u2022 Introduction of issues with respect to destination\u2019s improvement \nSMTEs \u2022 No sales staff required \n\u2022 No front-end money for future sales \n\u2022 Bulk sales (of perishable goods) \n\u2022 Reduced business risk by transferring part of it to the T.O. \n\u2022 Increased ability for medium to long-term planning \n\u2022 Limited staff and organisation to deal with customers\u2019 bookings, \ninquires etc. \n\u2022 Reduced promotional expenditures \n\u2022 Increased representation\/visibility in the international \nmarketplaces \n\u2022 Extended business season \n\u2022 Monitoring of quality standards and suggestion of improvements \n3. Methodology \n \nThis study is supported by thorough secondary research focusing on tourism distribution \nchannels and the relationships and problems arising between the members of these \nchannels. Additionally, specific attention was given to bring relevant SMTEs\u2019 literature \ninto the discussion, and synthesise it with the above-mentioned concepts (Buhalis, 2000; \nBuhalis and Cooper, 1992, 1998). The study also incorporates the outcomes of an \n10\nexploratory study concerning the power of European TOs in the Mediterranean leisure \ntourism context and the resultant \u201cdependency\u201d or over reliance of tourism firms on \nthem. SMTEs, due to their large number and importance in this geographical context, \nhave already occupied central position in the study. As mentioned earlier in this paper, \nmass tourism insular destinations are those that face the most extreme reliance on \ntourism intermediaries. Hence, a mass tourism Mediterranean island was deemed to be \nan ideal destination to conduct relevant research. The exploratory nature of the research \nprovided rich insight in the area of study and offered significant inferences, which will \nenable the researcher to quantify the research at the next stage. Analysis was primarily \nqualitative; aiming at highlighting the problems faced by destinations and tourism firms \n(primarily SMTEs) in their co-operation with large TOs. The research also aimed at \nidentifying significant operational, strategic and geographical variables that influence \nthe allocation of power in the tourism distribution channel and generate dependency on \nspecific channel members. Some clear trends and patterns have already been identified. \n \nThe exploratory research took place on the Greek island of Corfu, during the early \nmonths of the 2002 tourism season (late March-early April). This years\u2019 early European \nEastern stimulated an relatively early international demand, while the late Orthodox \nEastern did not allow domestic tourism to impact on the season\u2019s results and trends. \nMost of the tourism firms of the island were open or about to open, and interviews were \narranged rather comfortably. Hotel owners\/managers and incoming TOs in 16 different \nresort areas as well as destination experts were personally interviewed, using a semi-\nstructured questionnaire that have emerged from the in-depth secondary research. \nAdditionally, the outcomes of the research were enhanced by conducting in-depth \nqualitative interviews with persons in key positions in the local tourism industry, such \nas the President and the Secretary of the Local Hotel Managers\u2019 Association, the \nPresident of the Local Hoteliers\u2019 Association, the President of the Local Federation of \nAccommodation Establishments (apartments, villas etc) and General Secretary of the \nNational Federation of Accommodation Establishments, and finally the President of the \nLocal Technical Chamber. All these interviewees besides their institutional position \nown or manage a tourism firm. The targeted population was all the accommodation \nenterprises\u2019 owners and managers on the island. 25 Interviews were arranged keeping in \nmind the characteristics of the resorts, such as size; distance from international airport \nand consequently a very wide geographical distribution of the interviewed businesses \n11\nhad been achieved (Figure 3). Additionally, the researcher arranged interviews with \ntourism firms of every size and category in proportion to their actual percentages on the \nisland, in an attempt to achieve greater representation and enhanced generilisibility of \nthe outcomes. The sampling was a mixed purposeful sampling, with random sampling \ntechniques utilised to select the interviewees in tourism firms and convenience sampling \nto target people in institutional positions. The supplementary interviews, which were \nconducted with 6 incoming TOs, and with 2 people in tourism related public sector \npositions, enriched significantly the perspective of the study.  \n \nFigure 3: Map of Corfu. Places and numbers of interviews   \nCorfu Island\n12\n4. Findings \n \n4.1 The destination \n \nCorfu offers -for more than four decades- intentionally or not, the typical Mediterranean \npackage of Sea-Sun and Sand, while it leaves many other natural\/physical\/cultural \nattractions underdeveloped and weakly promoted. It also feels heavily the intense \ncompetition with other similar destinations in the Mediterranean basin. Corfu as a \ndestination deals with TOs of every size and type from almost all the European markets. \nBut it depends heavily on TOs from U.K. and Germany. Additionally, Corfu receives \nthe largest number of Britons than any other Greek destination, while the vast majority \nof them visit the island through a TO. Its accommodation supply is estimated to be \n45,000 bed spaces in hotels of every size and category and another 120,000 to 130,000 \nbed spaces in other officially and unofficially operated accommodation establishments \n(apartments, self catering rooms, villas, bungalows, \u201cparahoteleria\u201d). Apparently, the \naccommodation supply of the island experiences a considerable fragmentation. The vast \nmajority of firms are small and medium sized enterprises, employing less than 100 \npeople. At the same time Corfu faces all the typical structural and organisational \nproblems of Greek tourism that have their roots mainly in planning, marketing and \nmanagement of the tourism development and product. \n \n4.2 The impact of TOs on SMTEs \n \nThe research demonstrated that almost all the SMTEs felt that they have to co-operate \nwith TOs in order to communicate, distribute, and finally sell their tourism product to \nthe main European markets. The research, also, revealed that almost all SMTEs have \ncontracts with TOs to allow them to offer a number or all of their rooms in the market. \nFor SMTEs that have not assigned exclusivity rights to any specific TO, the average \nnumber of contracts is with 7 TOs of any size or type. The average percentage of \nbookings generated by TOs is almost 85%, although the corresponding percentage of \nturnover and profits generated by their contribution is always lower. It is interesting to \nnote that SMTEs\u2019 owners and managers believe that the larger the number of co-\noperating TOs the healthier the distribution mix and prospects of the firm, however they \n13\nwould have preferred to co-operate with even less TOs as an average (6) if it is to have \na smoother relationship. Additionally, they would have preferred to reduce TOs\u2019 input \nin bookings to 55%, and succeed in increasing the input of the other distribution \noptions, such as local travel agencies, direct bookings through I.T., domestic tourism \netc. They also observed that it would have been ideal to be able to avoid mass TOs and \nto augment \u201cspecialists\u201d as much as possible, since they felt that there is a slightly better \nquality of co-operation with specialists in comparison with their mass counterparts. \nSMTEs\u2019 managers\/owners also noted how beneficial would have been to be able to \navoid the remarkable market dualism (U.K.-Germany) and have contracts with TOs \nfrom many different markets in order to spread the exogenous business risks caused by \nnegative trends and irregularities in their markets. Finally, they would like to restrict the \npercentage of the largest co-operating mass TO to less than 30% of their capacity, since \nthey felt that there should always be an upward limit to the firm\u2019s capacity contracted \nby a certain TO. Above the limit the co-operation becomes more problematic, since the \nTO acquires excessive power and influence over the firm\u2019s short-term decision-making \nand medium to long-term business prospects.  \n \nYet, according to the interviewees in the modern leisure tourism context opportunities \nfor alternative market strategies are limited and largely ineffective. They felt that Intra-\nEuropean leisure tourism is \u2013for the time being - \u201cdependent\u201d on massive tourism \nintermediaries, who are able to determine the fate and prosperity of destinations and \nsuppliers based on their capacity to influence tourism tastes and demand trends. This \ncan be mainly attributed to the fact that leisure tourists are very flexible in their \ndecision-making and show great elasticity in their demand patterns. Therefore \nintermediaries can influence not only their fundamental choice of destination, but also \nmany other successive decisions such as the choice of accommodation. Consequently, \nany successful efforts to avoid intermediaries and appeal directly to the consumer in the \norigin markets are perceived rather as \u201cutopia\u201d for SMTEs. Such efforts could only play \na supportive role next to SMTEs\u2019 mainstream option for marketing their product \ninternationally, namely the tour operation industry. \n \nThis approach becomes even more imperative, if it is taken into account that more than \n95% of the interviewed SMTEs have initiated their co-operation with TOs from the time \nthey started their business, hence they had limited motivation to gain familiarity and \n14\nexperience on any other selling techniques. The vast majority of these SMTEs rely \nfaithfully on TOs for their business. Moreover, a considerable 25% of these SMTEs had \nbeen assisted or urged in several ways (financially, technically, operationally, \ncontractually, morally) by TO(s) in the development or expansion of their facilities. \nTherefore, they have already placed themselves in a \u201cdependency\u201d continuum, ranging \nfrom absolute reliance to moral obligation. Interviewees clearly demonstrated that for \nthe vast majority of SMTEs the only pragmatic option is to keep on co-operating with \nTOs, identify the problems faced during their co-operation, and try to solve them in the \ngiven business context by increasing their negotiation power; improving the intra-\nchannel relationships; and by developing patterns of mutual benefit with the other \nchannel members. Finally, interviewees demonstrated that they would -most probably- \ninvest in alternative marketing and distribution options only as the last resort, when no \nother possibilities are available.  \n \n4.2.1 Advantages of TOs\u2019 involvement \n \nAs it has been identified by this research, SMTEs\u2019 owners\/managers acknowledge that \nfor many years TOs were the \u201ceducators\u201d for the SMTEs\u2019 people. They provided the \nnecessary guidance to the entrepreneurs to comprehend the needs and wants of the \ncustomers during their stay in the enterprise. The constant pressure by TOs for \nimprovement in facilities and services, have driven safely many SMTEs to a remarkable \nand extremely marketable final product on offer. Additionally, in many cases TOs \nshared their expert knowledge of the market and directed or \u201cpushed\u201d enterprises to \nproductive investments and mutually beneficial synergies. For instance, the \ndevelopment of small conference facilities or the specialisation and targeting of a niche, \nhowever, beneficial market segment are choices that very few SMTEs\u2019 decision-makers \nwould have taken by themselves.  \n \nTwo other very significant advantages of TOs\u2019 involvement are their eminent standards \nof operational efficiency and organisation that permit minimum possibilities for \nmisunderstandings and disorder, and their financial consistency (they may not paying \nwell, but they definitely pay). The former advantage is almost unanimously recognised \nby every co-operating SMTE. Interviewees added that this efficiency in organisation \n15\nhelps their enterprises significantly to be more organised in their own records, and to \nconcentrate their interest in satisfying the customer. Hence, SMTEs have the \nopportunity not only to avoid much \u201cbureaucracy\u201d, but also to improve the standards of \ntheir offer to the customer. As far as it concerns the latter advantage of TOs \ninvolvement, interviewees noted that larger TOs offer a better sense of security and \nconsistency on financial matters. Smaller TOs may not offer the same sense of financial \nsecurity and consistency, however the relationship with them is more human-based with \nincreased personal contact and mutual appreciation and respect, something that \nattenuates significantly the financial concerns. The latter advantage is remarkably \nopposed with past researches\u2019 outcomes (Buhalis, 2000) that presented TOs\u2019 financial \nconsistency (bankruptcies and payment delays) much less appreciated by owners and \nmanagers. This could be attributed to the fact that in the past financial difficulties and \nbankruptcies were usual phenomena in the tour operating industry every summer, \nsomething that had been spoiling heavily the image of TOs as payers. Nowadays, \nconsolidation of the tour operating industry and \u201chabitual\u201d mergers and take-overs \nallow limited probability for any organisation to get to worrying level of financial \nshortage or to the final business stage of bankruptcy, without having attempted to merge \n(co-operate) or without being absorbed by another strong competitor. \n \nLast but not least, is the acknowledgment by SMTEs\u2019 owners\/managers that TOs were \nthe facilitators of the tourism growth and magnitude both on the Island and in their \nenterprises. It is not far from reality to argue that these intermediaries initially served as \nthe necessary catalysts for the \u201cchemical reaction\u201d of tourism at the destination. Almost \nall the SMTEs\u2019 customers, even the loyal repeaters that now avoid to use intermediaries, \nhave visited sometime in the past the Island through a TO. In the modern tourism \nenvironment, however, TOs\u2019 role has advanced further, and they now comprise \nessential elements, if any kind of tourism \u201creaction\u201d is to take place. This evolution of \nTOs as essential components of the tourism activity has transformed significantly the \nnature of and the relationships within the tourism chain. The different and in many cases \nopposing nature, orientation and interest of all the key players provokes and maintains a \ncomplex system of co-operation, competition, conflict and inter-dependency between \nand among them. The complex and highly competitive environment of the tourism \nchain means that there will be some \u201cturbulence\u201d (Go & Pine, 1995) and, as \n16\nSchumpeter (1965) recognised many decades ago, there is no \u201cequilibrium\u201d in \ncompetition. \n \n4.2.2. Problems faced by SMTEs when dealing with TOs \n \nMany acute problems and complaints concerning the co-operation with TOs have been \nidentified during the research. Most of the interviewees felt that TO\u2019s size -large, \nmedium and small- is not a very significant factor in relation to tourism firms\u2019 level of \nsatisfaction by the co-operation or to the observed problems. As interviewees argued \nmarket conditions and intense competition have forced TOs to adopt, more or less, the \nsame tactics and strategies in order to survive in their markets and operate viably. The \nindifference of owners\/managers for TO\u2019s size was much more evident in smaller and \nlower category accommodation establishments, while larger hotels rated the small \noperators clearly higher than their large\/integrated counterparts. This reveals that \nsmaller enterprises are always the weakest player in the bargaining game with every \nTO, hence they always experience tougher co-operation.  \n \nTos\u2019 type, however, has a clear pattern as regards the quality of co-operation with the \nSMTE. Niche (specialised) operators enjoy a significantly better rating than their mass \ncounterparts. This can be linked with the first observation concerning size. Mass TOs \nirrespective of their size are tougher in their co-operation, mainly due to the immensely \ncompetitive environment of the mass tourism market.  \n \nAs far as it concerns TOs\u2019 nationalities, the relationships of British and German based \ngroups with SMTEs receive the lowest ratings, with the evaluation worsening as the \ncategory and the size of the SMTE decreases. French TOs appear also to be rather \nproblematic in their co-operation, while interviewees perceive Scandinavian and Italian \ngroups to be relatively better partners. It must be noted though that the categorisation of \nTOs according to country of base, has become a less important determinative factor and \nin the near future is expected to become obsolete, since the large integrated groups \noperate in many different countries and markets. Despite the fact that these large groups \nsometimes retain different brand names for their companies and products, they \npredominantly operate their companies\u2019 bundles with common, centralised strategies. A \n17\nfuture accurate description of their nationality could be \u201cIntra-European TOs\u201d (Figure \n4). It is safe to assume that the similar rating that the interviewees assigned to the \nBritish and German groups, could be attributed to the acquisition and concentration \npatterns in these two markets. Almost all large British and German TO groups, are \nliterally under joint ownerships or even brand names (except of the British based \nAirtours). \n \nThe apparent concentration trends in the European TO industry have already impacted \nsignificantly on the degree and the quality of co-operation between TOs and SMTEs, \nand the interviewees made some very interesting remarks on that. They mentioned, that \nthe extent of the co-operation is directly affected by concentration trends, since the \nmerged scheme is not \u201cbuying\u201d the same amount of rooms than the two previous groups \ntogether. Additionally, the quality of the co-operation is influenced since the large \ngroup becomes even less sensitive and impersonal, with the relationship based on \nstrictly financial parameters. Even further the \u201cpackage\u201d of the merged group becomes \nmore integrated with a clear inclination to leave less and less benefits to the enterprises \nand the host economies.  \n \n18\nFigure 4: Concentration in the European Tour Operating industry\nIntra-European Tour Operating Groups\nMother company\nSubsidiaries\nTHE WORLD OF TUI THOMAS COOK AG FIRST CHOICE AIRTOURS Plc REWE GROUP\nTOUR OPERATING\n(MANUFACTURERS-\nWHOLESALERS)\n\u2022 TUI GERMANY\n\u2022 TUI UK (THOMSON T.G.)\n\u2022 TUI NETHERLANDS\n\u2022 TUI AUSTRIA\n\u2022 TUI FINLAND\n\u2022 TUI SUISSE\n\u2022 TUI IRELAND\n\u2022 TUI POLAND\n\u2022 AUSTRAVEL\n\u2022 COUNTRY COTTAGES (UK & FRANCE)\n\u2022 CHEZ NOUS\n\u2022 CRYSTAL\n\u2022 BLAKES COTTAGES\n\u2022 MAGIC TRAVEL\n\u2022 SIMPLY TRAVEL\n\u2022 HORIZON\n\u2022 BUDGET TRAVEL\n\u2022 PORTLAND DIRECT\n\u2022 SKYTOURS\n\u2022 SOMETHING SPECIAL HOLIDAYS\n\u2022 SPANISH HBR\n\u2022 AIRTOURS (GER)\n\u2022 AIR CONTI\n\u2022 L\u2019 TUR\n\u2022 NOUVELLES FRONTIERES\n\u2022 TRAVEL UNIE INTERN.\n\u2022 EX-ARKE\n\u2022 HOLLAND INTERN.\n\u2022 FIRST\n\u2022 FIRST TRAVEL MANAGEMENT\n\u2022 KRAS\n\u2022 VTB-VAB REISEN\n\u2022 JETAIR\n\u2022 FRITIDSRESOR\n\u2022 STAR TOUR\n\u2022 ROYAL TOURS\n\u2022 TEMA\n\u2022 NORDPOOL (or NRT NORDPOOL)\n\u2022 PRISMA TOURS\n\u2022 SCAN HOLIDAY\n\u2022 FINNMATKAT\n\u2022 GULET TOUROPA\n\u2022 ITV (SWITZERLAND)\n\u2022 VOGELE\n\u2022 IMHOLZ\n\u2022 TRAVAK\nAT LEAST 39 TO BRANDS\n\u2022 JMC HOLIDAYS\n\u2022 C&N GROUP\n\u2022 NECKERMANN REISEN\n\u2022 NECKERMANN BELGIUM\n\u2022 ALLAIR\n\u2022 SUNSNACKS\n\u2022 NECKERMANN NETHERL.\n\u2022 BROERE REISEN\n\u2022 NECKERMANN AUSTRIA\n\u2022 KUONI\n\u2022 CONDOR\n\u2022 BUCHER REISEN\n\u2022 FISCHER REISEN\n\u2022 TERRAMAR\n\u2022 KREUTZER REISEN\n\u2022 THOMAS COOK HOLIDAYS\n\u2022 GRUPO VIAJES IBERIA\n\u2022 SUNWORLD\n\u2022 FLYING COLOURS\n\u2022 SUNSET\n\u2022 INSPIRATIONS\n\u2022 CLUB 18-30\n\u2022 NEILSON\n\u2022 STYLE\n\u2022 ACCOLADIA\n\u2022 TIME OFF\n\u2022 AIR MARINE\n\u2022 HAVAS VOYAGES (FRANCE)\n\u2022 FIRST CHOICE HOLIDAYS\n\u2022 UNIJET\n\u2022 HAYES & JARVIS\n\u2022 RAINBOW\n\u2022 FLEXISKI\n\u2022 MEON\n\u2022 SUNSAIL\n\u2022 CROWN BLUE LINE\n\u2022 SUNQUEST\n\u2022 EXODUS\n\u2022 BARCELO TRAVEL\n\u2022 TEN TOUR\n\u2022 NAZAR\n\u2022 TAURUS\n\u2022 MY TRAVEL\n\u2022 BRIDGE TRAVEL GROUP\n\u2022 CRESTA HOLIDAYS\n\u2022 DIRECT HOLIDAYS\n\u2022 PANORAMA\n\u2022 TRADEWINDS\n\u2022 EUROSITES\n\u2022 JETSET\n\u2022 MANOS\n\u2022 LEGER\n\u2022 SUNWAY TRAVEL\n\u2022 SCANDINAVIAN LEISURE GROUP\n\u2022 VING\n\u2022 SAGA\n\u2022 ALWAYS\n\u2022 TJAEREBORG\n\u2022 SPIES\n\u2022 FROSCH TOURISTIK INTERN.

These specific attributes of the co-operation with TOs were given to \ninterviewees, asking to rate them in a Likert scale ranging from \u201cvery satisfied\u201d to \u201cvery \nunsatisfied\u201d. Interviewees demonstrated clearly that, as an average, they are rather \nsatisfied with the financial consistency and the operational efficiency and organisation \nof T.O.s, hence these two attributes could be perceived as advantages of their co-\noperation. However, interviewees ranked the other attributes of the co-operation poorly. \nAccording to SMTEs\u2019 owners\/managers their main problems when dealing with TOs \ncould be identified in the broad areas presented in Figure 5 with order of significance. \nInterviewees were also asked to support their ranking with relevant arguments, \nsomething that formed the base for the forthcoming analysis of the problematic areas. \n \nFigure 5: SMTEs\u2019 problematic areas in their co-operation with TOs \nLoyalty of TOs \/ commitment  \nPrice and profit margins \nNegotiations \/ contracts \nContractual consistency \nQuality demands\/ quality of customers  \nUnderstanding\/respect of TOs to the firm and its needs \n(human) Relationship with the people of the firm  \n4.3.1 Loyalty and commitment of TOs \nThe most important concern of SMTEs owners and managers is the anxiety that they \nexperience in their co-operation with TOs, especially the large ones. The low level of \nTOs\u2019 commitment to destination areas and the weak loyalty that they usually show to \ntheir business partners causes this obvious insecurity. As the interviewees felt, both \ndestinations in the Mediterranean basin and SMTEs in these destinations have been \ndeveloped primarily as undifferentiated 4S products and hence are highly substitutable \nin market terms. This is reinforced by the intention and ability of TOs to control, up to a \nconsiderable degree the image and the promotion of destinations and tourism firms in \nthe international market. Large TOs avoid any kind of diversity, and they prefer to \n21\noperate under the umbrella of uniformity and standardisation, and to promote what is \ndetermined by their own branding rather than the specific characteristics of destinations \nand their firms. By promoting basic and mainstream features of the destinations and the \nfirms, and ignoring any other attractions and additional characteristics, TOs succeed in \nmaking places and enterprises even more vulnerable to the threat of substitution from a \ncompetitor. This is particularly a concern of mass-market resorts -like the one under \nstudy- where the long reliance on TOs\u2019 clientele has led to the commodification of the \nresort product by intermediaries (Laws and Cooper, 1998). SMTEs experience the threat \nof substitutability more intensely than the larger destination suppliers. Unfortunately, \naccording to SMTEs\u2019 owners\/managers, the most straightforward way to react to this \nthreat is to try to comply fully with the demands of the current co-operating TOs. \n \n4.3.2 Price\/profit margins and contractual negotiations \n \nThe two next most important \u2013and indeed fundamental and interlinked- problems faced \nby SMTEs are the constant pressure for lower prices and the toughness and \n\u201ccoerciveness\u201d of negotiations. The pressure is primarily evident in the negotiations and \nrenegotiations prior to the signing of the season\u2019s contracts and in the usual requests for \nspecial\/promotional offers later in the season. Interviewees perceived the price they are \ncurrently \u201cforced\u201d to accept from TOs, to be at least 35 percentage points depreciated \nrelative to the given standard of services they offer. It is descriptive that many SMTEs \noffer the same rate (especially in allotment contracts) for third consecutive tourism \nseason, while owners\/managers of SMTEs expect and argue for an absolutely necessary \nannual increase of one or two percentage points above the real inflation of the \ndestination country (mode). Interviewees noted that this accumulated underpayment \nputs service providers under immense pressure. Many interviewees sharply remarked \nthat price is the most critical factor for TOs, since they have to finance price wars and \nunreasonable discounting in the High Street, as well as to survive cutting-throat \ncompetition in their marketplaces. \n \nVarious coercive techniques have been identified through research, although rarely \nofficially verified, which are used by TOs to pressurise SMTEs aiming at reducing the \nroom rates. Buhalis (2000) has identified 10 methods frequently used by TO to \n22\nnegotiate prices down. The vast power of TOs coupled with the lack or inefficiency of \nalternative distribution options, assigns them great advantages during negotiations, and \nallows them not only to force SMTEs to accept the prices they offer, but also to \nmanipulate a considerable part of the bargaining framework, in which the negotiations \nwill take place. SMTEs are the more vulnerable objects of every coercion, fallacious \ninformation, and financial speculation since they lack both information intelligence and \nresources of every nature to oppose these organised pressures. As they have no viable \nalternative distribution and marketing mechanism, many SMTEs\u2019 interviewees felt \n\u201clocked\u201d in the existing system and powerless to move forward.  \n \nFurthermore, endless negotiating and price pressure allows limited opportunities to \nSMTEs to achieve substantial profitability and return on investment. Many interviewees \nclaimed that the financial state of affairs for SMTEs is much more dramatic than \nofficially reported, if it is taken into account that many SMTEs are based on unpaid \nlabour from family members. This correspondingly affects the lack financial ability to \ninvest in service improvement; additions or renovations to the facilities and \nsuperstructure. Difficult market conditions also cause alienation of the managers\/owners \nfrom occupation and ownership respectively and subsequent reluctance to invest in \nstaff\u2019s (including themselves) development and training.  \n \n4.3.3 Contractual consistency \n \nHomocentric to the problems of pricing and negotiations are the complaints that arose \nwith respect to the contractual consistency. Usually, low coverage of contracts is a \ndeliberate procrastination or the impact of previous over-contracting used by TOs to \npressurise SMTEs and achieve their commercial interests. Hence, level of coverage of \nallotment contracts is a major point of tension between SMTEs and TOs. Of course, \nthere are cases were low coverage of a signed contract could be attributed to exogenous \nnegative evolutions or to irrationally optimistic estimations of future demand by TOs\u2019 \nexecutives. However, even in these cases complaints are arisen with respect to the very \ndelayed notification of the suppliers, as well as to the usage of the situation to \nrenegotiate prices. Furthermore, interviewees remarked that although contractual \n23\ninconsistency has no real ratification for TOs, the inability of SMTEs to comply with \none of the contract\u2019s conditions \u2013such as in overbooking- is usually followed by severe \ndirect and indirect penalties. Many interviewees admitted straightforwardly that the lack \nof actual co-operation with TOs and information sharing in booking patterns push many \nSMTEs to unnecessary over-bookings with dramatic consequences for both SMTEs and \nTOs depending on the circumstances. Linked to the above are the complaints reported \nfrom SMTEs about a number of complicated and hard to notice terms and conditions at \nthe end of the contracts. These terms and conditions, usually described as \u201csmall print\u201d \nhave formed the basis for the development of a \u201clegal action industry\u201d in the origin \ncountries from both customers and TOs. \n \nThe establishment of specialised legal offices in the main tourism generating markets, \nthat encourage consumers to take legal actions, is a threatening aspect for SMTEs. They \nfear that, according to the new European Court of Justice directives and case laws, they \nwould have to shoulder half of the liability and penalty, even in cases of misleading \ninformation by TOs\u2019 brochures. If it taken into account that E.C.J. has recently \napproved tourists\u2019 claims not only for vacation\u2019s cost remuneration but also for loss of \nvacation time and suffering damages, it is not far from reality to assume that this would \npotentially trigger the appearance of a market segment that will prefer to pursue free \nvacations, plus some pocket money. SMTEs\u2019 owners\/managers argued that the \nappearance of such a \u201clegal action industry\u201d would be very damaging even in the case \nof unfounded and easily proved cases, since it will be financially overwhelming for \nthem to employee permanent legal representation, something that may force many \nSMTEs out of business. \n \n4.3.4 Quality demanded and quality \u201csupplied\u201d   \n \nThe majority of TOs usually demands maximum service and quality standards with the \nminimum contract price. This is evident by conventional wisdom and adequately \nillustrated and supported by previous research. This leads tourism firms to a vicious \ncycle of declining quality and depreciated prices, which impacts mostly SMTEs. Unlike \nlarger hotels and hotel chains, SMTEs lack the resources and the marketing expertise to \norchestrate and finance a potential exit plan from the spiral.  \n24\nDuring recent years, however, an additional worrying trend has been imported by large \nTOs. Interviewees noted that larger operators are less concerned with quality in \ncomparison with the past. They are unilaterally focused on the reduction of prices, \nsometimes even at the expense of the quality that their customer will enjoy. Several \ninterviewees revealed that when they complained about their high operational costs and \nasked for a slight increase of the room rate, they were actively encouraged by large TOs \nto reduce cost by disconnecting air-condition facilities from the rooms, by reducing \nfrequency and quality of cleaning services or by reducing frequency of swimming \npool\u2019s maintenance (cleaning, chemicals, water recycling etc). As a result many planned \nor existing improvements and additions to the properties have been cancelled or \nwithdrawn, not only due to lack of available funds, but also after the pressure from TOs. \nAdditionally, it is a repulsive factor for the owners who intend to enhance their \nproduct\u2019s quality, since they know that they will never be financially rewarded or even \nbetter appreciated by their main business partners. Hence, it is clearly manifested that \nintense competition among large TOs has already forced them to direct demand or \nimposition of lower quality standards. Characteristically, some interviewees noted that \nlarger TOs are not any more very concerned with their customers\u2019 real satisfaction from \nvacation, but mostly with ensuring their customer\u2019s safety and covering the basic \ndescription of their brochure, in order to avoid future legal action from customers. \nU.K.\u2019s Consumers\u2019 Association biennial TO survey, where larger operators consistently \nunderperform, confirms this trend (latest January 2001). \n \nThis trend not only pushes SMTEs further into the vicious cycle of \u201cdeclining quality-\ndepreciated price\u201d, but also affects and spoils the travel experience and the satisfaction \nlevels of their customers. Better prices are occasionally conveyed to the customer, \nsomething that boosts the demand in the short-term, and benefits both TOs and SMTEs. \nHowever, the gradual degradation of service and quality is always transferred to the \ncustomer with damaging effects in the long run, primarily for SMTEs, since TO have \nthe advantage to move on another destination or firm. After some consecutive tourism \nseasons within this spiral SMTEs and entire resort areas found themselves in a difficult \nto reverse position. This is evident in resorts such as Kavos, Benitses and Ipsos in \nCorfu, where on the one hand this trend spoiled heavily their image and reputation, on \nthe other hand it decreased the \u201cquality\u201d of customers in terms of income; interests; \n25\nrespect to the people, the host places and the properties. It is very revealing the remark \nof many industry professionals that Corfu appeals simultaneously to low and high \nincome customers with very diverse range of status and interests, while it experiences \nan observable loss of middle income customers in comparison with past years. That \nmeans that on the relatively small and homogenous island of Corfu some resorts and \nbusinesses have rescued their image and reputation offering a high quality tourism \nproduct for demanding clients, while some others have been trapped in the vicious cycle \ndescribed above loosing the largest by any measure target market along with their \ncapacities to reverse the negative situation. Destination experts of the island argued that \nsuch worrying trends put the positive impacts of the entire tourism industry under \nquestion and deter locals from further investment in both the micro (enterprise) and \nmacro (resort, destination, island) level. \n \n4.3.5 Relationship with partners, understanding and respect to their needs \n \nAs far as it concerns the human relationships of TOs with the suppliers, and the \nunderstanding and respect they show to the needs of places, SMTEs and the people in \nthem, the rating was again rather worrying. SMTEs\u2019 owners\/managers rated very poorly \ntheir personal and professional relationships with the people that represent large TOs. \nBoth product and contract managers have been characterised as being impersonal in \ntheir contacts and unresponsive \u2013many times even disrespectful- to the needs and the \ncharacteristics of destinations and tourism firms, especially to the more vulnerable \nsmaller size firms. Scale economies have driven large TOs to recruit and train a team of \nproduct and contract experts that are responsible for examining and deciding market \naction for vast destination areas and massive numbers of individual properties. Those \nprofessionals do not have any special knowledge of the destination, its environmental, \nsocial and economical conditions and background and treat people and places as \ncommodities. Additionally, contract managers have tough financial targets to meet, and \ntheir own remuneration depends on their effectiveness. Most of the SMTEs owners and \nmanagers recalled nostalgically the situation before some years when a familiarisation \ntrip, a warm dinner and a sincere dialogue had been always preceded any final \nagreement or disagreement, and noted that the apathy and the \u201ccoldness\u201d of the current \n26\nnegotiations are actually even more disappointing features than the low or \u201cfrozen\u201d \nprices.   \n \nThe same complaints arose with respect to the incoming operators at the destinations \nand the TOs\u2019 representatives. The human-based relationship with the incoming operator \nis extremely important for SMTEs that lack detailed budgetary plan, alternative sources \nof finance and the ability to monitor the market trends by own means. However, many \nlarge TOs have established their own incoming agencies that operate in strict \naccordance to their parent companies\u2019 strategies and tactics. Again, the absence of the \nlocal incoming agent that could be more perceptive in financial matters; contact \npersonally the industry people; provide up-to-dated information and consultation as \nregards market and booking trends; assist morally or financially in difficult tourism \nseasons is more than apparent by the SMTEs owners\/managers. Interviewees claimed \nthat in many organisations both transfer representatives and incoming agencies\u2019 \npersonnel is being rotated periodically between destinations in order to avoid the \ndevelopment of personal friendships and bonds with the place and the people. Finally, \nin contrast with the past, TOs\u2019 incoming agencies recruit unqualified and inadequately \ntrained transfer representatives. Young people somewhere between 18 and 25 are \nusually given the opportunity to make free vacations by representing a TO. Lack of \nqualifications and training, young of age, and inexperience to handle difficult situations \nleads them to a very unprofessional attitude against other tourism professionals and \nsometimes even against customers. In addition, representatives are usually underpaid \nand need to sell excursions and other activities to supplement their income, often \nresulting to \u201caggressive\u201d tactics. Representatives however are not only the first \nimpression that a customer gets upon his\/her arrival, but also the psychological link \nbetween the origin and the destination place and culture. An impolite, \u201coverpushing\u201d or \n\u201cauthoritarian\u201d representative at the airport can \u201cproduce\u201d under certain circumstances a \ncoach full of offensive and irritable tourists. These negative features in conjunction with \npoor or absolute ignorance about the destination are in many cases responsible for \nspoiling the vacation of a customer or the co-operation with an hotelier.  \n \n27\n5. Discussion: Can SMTEs avoid some of these problems?  \n \nIt is evident from the analysis that a large number of the problems faced by SMTEs on \nthe Mediterranean Islands can be attributed to the uncontested power of the tour \noperating industry. The size, the established oligopolistic and oligopsonistic situation in \nthe origins and the destinations respectively, and the lack of a detailed legal framework \nand \u201cpunishment\u201d strategies are all factors that sustain an uncontested power advantage \nfor the larger travel organisations in the European leisure market. This enables them to \nsustain a favourable position in negotiations and pressurise SMTEs\u2019 owners\/managers \nfinancially, operationally and psychologically. Game Theory is the area of the \nEconomics that deals with the bargaining processes and patterns in every industry and \nmarket. By drawing some basics from Game Theory, an initial framework could be \ndeveloped to incorporate the areas that could potentially offer significant competitive \nadvantages to one or another member of the bargaining process. The bargaining process \nbetween SMTEs and TOs is sequential, since it always includes a series of proposals, \ncounterproposals, negotiations and renegotiations. Additionally, it can be described as a \ngame of asymmetric information, since the two players do not share the same \ninformation, with one of them enjoying significantly better insight and private \ninformation relevant to the bargaining. Utilising power, timing, information and \nposition considerations one could argue for the TOs\u2019 favourable position in a bargaining \ngame with asymmetric information, as illustrated in Figure 6: \n \n28\nFigure 6: A \u201cbargaining game\u201d with asymmetric information: TOs\u2019 position \n \nPowerful player of the game\n\u2022 Size \n\u2022 Oligopolistic behaviour in the origin markets \n\u2022 Oligopsonistic state for destinations and tourism firms \n\u2022 Lack or avoidance of any \u201cpunishment\u201d strategies \n\u201cPatient\u201d player of the game\n\u2022 Ability to take advantage of the very important factor \u201ctiming of bargaining\u201d, by: \n1. Negotiating contracts during low occupancy period and thus capitalising on the poor results of the \nfirm and the anxiety of the owners\/managers. \n2. Over-contracting intentionally, waiting until clear signs of low coverage of these contracts and start \nrenegotiating prices and special offers.  \n3. Rushing next year\u2019s contractual negotiations and withholding information about current booking \npatterns, when the current year has signs for strong demand.    \n4. Delaying next year\u2019s contractual negotiations when the current year is expected to hold low demand \nin order to push tourism firms to offer special discounts and last minute offers to reverse the \nworrying trends \nPlayer of the game with private information\n\u2022 TOs\u2019 pivotal position in the tourism distribution channel, assigns them the ability to receive more \ninformation from the market than tourism suppliers, with many clear advantages for them, such as: \n1. Clear indications of booking trends (used for the above mentioned timing of bargaining) \n2. Customer satisfaction surveys (misquoting or manipulating the results to ask for further price \nreductions) \n3. Cultivation of a \u201cfake\u201d competition between resorts and enterprises (taking advantage of the \nconfidentiality closures in contracts to deliberately quote misleading information, and thus inducing \nprice reductions) \n4. Encouragement of an unlawful \u201cprice fixing\u201d game (taking advantage of both the confidentiality \nclosures in the contracts with hoteliers and the \u201cunofficial\u201d agreements between other TOs not to \ninterfere in each others\u2019 relationships with local firms). \n5. Concealment of booking position of a tourism firm. This private information coupled with the very \nshort release period that does not allow adequate time to hoteliers to sell\/ reallocate any unwanted \naccommodation force them to accept further reductions to attract last minute customers. This \ntechnique is usually combined with the above mentioned intentional over contracting. \nPlayer of the game with favourable market position\n\u2022 TOs\u2019 pivotal position in the tourism distribution channel, assigns them ability to communicate more \ninformation to the market than tourism suppliers, with many clear advantages for them, such as: \n1. \u201cSwitch-selling\u201d by directing customers to certain properties and resorts in which TOs have own \ninterests or more beneficial contracts. \n2. Misleading customers and repulse them from choosing certain properties and resorts by quoting \nfallacious overbookings situations and unfounded risks and problems, in order to put in practice in a \nlatter stage the renegotiation technique with hoteliers. Dramatic consequences to the \u201crepeaters\u201d \ncustomer segment. \n3. Exploit of any negative news concerning the destinations and launch well-projected alleged crises. \nTOs many times exaggerate, reproduce and tactically communicate the effects of negative events \non bookings, in order to ask or demand price reduction or special offers.  \n4. Alter the image of destinations, resorts and properties to fit their own specifications instead of \npromoting reality and local intentions and targets. This is damaging in both ways. On the one hand \nlocal firms and places fail to project their desired image and to achieve their own targets; on the \nother hand many times tourism firms and places face unfair demands and expectations by \nincorrectly informed customers.   \n5. Control up to a decisive degree the intensity of promotional efforts, the representation and the \nmarket visibility of tourism firms and resorts, something that allows TOs to maintain their \nnegotiation advantages (i.e. they could choose to reject high demand for one year and restrain \noptimistic demand trends in order to enjoy better contracts for 2-3 seasons ahead or they could \nunder promote certain tourism firms to renegotiate price reductions and special offers).  \n29\nMany of the points that explain TOs\u2019 favourable position have already been clearly \nillustrated and adequately supported during the analysis of the co-operation. However, a \ncouple of distinctive examples that have been identified during the research could be \nused to support even further the arguments. Firstly, almost all the interviewees reported \ncases of long repeating customers that contacted them to apologise for not coming this \nyear, since they had been informed by the local TO\u2019s agency that the nice family-run \nhotel was fully booked. Needless to say that in all cases the firm\u2019s room vacancy was \nranging from empty to hardly full. This revelation is very frustrating for an owner \nbecause, not only his\/her enterprise will not fill its vacant rooms, but also he\/she will \nlose a repeat customer. Also, in the 2002 tourism season interviewees reported four \ncases of TOs\u2019 price cut campaigns. They were based on dissemination of negative \nbooking patterns by TOs due to negative events. The alleged booking crises were of \ndiverse magnitude \u2013depending on the social penetration of the event- and drove almost \nevery firm\u2019s contracts (existing and future) to the (re) negotiation tables, on a different \nbasis. After the signing of the new contracts, the real booking patterns are usually \n\u201csarcastically\u201d revealed. Also, the interviewees mentioned characteristically the \noverplayed consequences of the September 11th terrorist attack. SMTEs were pushed to \nrenegotiate their contracts, and after it became clear that there had been no real decrease \nof demand for summer vacations, they collectively asked to revalidate their previous \ncontracts. Some TOs approved the SMTEs\u2019 demand, however, the large and integrated \norganisations declined the proposal, by claiming that they have to spread their own \nfinancial winter-market damage. Many owners and managers expressed plausible \nobservations, such as: \u201cwhy should a small family-managed enterprise shoulder part of \nthe business risk of a globalised and constantly expanding organisation\u201d and \u201cwhy, \nhave we never taken an unexpected bonus after signing our contracts, following a \nthriving season for TOs in winter resorts\u201d.  \n \nRealistically, SMTE lack expertise, resources and tools to act independently and \ninfluence significantly the allocation of power in the tourism distribution channel.  \nLarge TOs increasingly have the ability to interfere in the global competition patterns \nand rotate the demand of entire destination areas, as in the case of \u201cstructural \nseasonality destination cycle\u201d(Buhalis, 2000: 126). Since large TOs have the power to \ninfluence to a considerable degree the booking patterns and trends between \nMediterranean Islands, it is safe to assume that they could really \u201cdictate\u201d the booking \n30\ntrends between SMTE-A and nearby SMTE-B on the same island. It is an optimistic \nfacet, however, that at least the acuteness of almost all these problems (except of the \nhuman relationships and the quality of the co-operation) is directly related with the \nqualitative characteristics of each SMTE and its decision makers. Several relevant \npatterns have been identified during the research as illustrated in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: SMTEs and dependency on TOs: Negative correlated variables \nSMTEs dependency on TOs is negatively correlated with: \nCategory of the property \u2022 Higher category \nSize of the property \u2022 Higher size \nStrong educational background of \nowner\/manager \n\u2022 Higher education \n\u2022 Tourism specific studies \n\u2022 Tourism specific training and courses \nHealthy distribution mix \u2022 Large number of contracted TOs \n\u2022 Sensible ratio of allotment\/commitment contracts \n\u2022 Significant contribution of specialised TOs \n\u2022 Small but solid percentage of direct bookings \nHealthy and diverse clientele mix \u2022 Many compatible nationalities \n\u2022 Many macroeconomically independent markets \n\u2022 Significant role of domestic tourists \n\u2022 Large percentage of repeaters \nCertain Operational features  \u2022 Low seasonality of operation \nCertain Property features \u2022 Age of property and facilities \n\u2022 Short period from last renovation \n\u2022 Self-funded construction or expansion \nCertain Location factors \u2022 Proximity to international airport \n\u2022 No overcapacity problem \nAll these factors appear to contribute significantly towards the amelioration of the \nproblems faced when dealing with TOs. SMTEs should aim in improving as much as \npossible these qualitative characteristics in order to strengthen not only their bargaining \npower, but also their competitiveness. The few SMTEs that have succeeded in \nmanoeuvring the above-mentioned factors for their benefit are already in a position to \nplan their own strategies. Additionally, they clearly enjoy a much better co-operation \nwith intermediaries. These tourism firms should serve as guides to improvement for \nother SMTEs.  \n \nThe business environment is a solidly established and highly unfavourable for small \nplayers. Some inherent negative features of mass tourism are widespread and deeply \nrooted in the structures of the modern world and society, hence impossible to be \nconfronted from within the firm\u2019s boundaries. Therefore, if SMTEs want to respond to \n31\nthe negotiating advantages of tourism distributors and influence the status quo within \nthe channel, they should act all together, and capitalise on their advantages.   \n \n5.1 SMTEs and TOs: The step ahead. \n \nHaving as focal point SMTEs, this paper has concentrated its interest so far in \nexamining the advantages of and the problems faced by them when involving TOs. The \nfinal part will briefly present suggested counterbalancing actions and policies that have \nemerged from the interviews with the industry people, and which should be \nincorporated in SMTEs\u2019 strategies.  \n \nMany interviewees suggested that a starting point for SMTEs to confront the \nunfavourable situation is to capitalise on their inherent strengths. Although small size is \nusually associated with limited resources, expertise and power, it can also provide \nsignificant competitive advantages as far as entrepreneurship, flexibility and \nspecialisation is concerned. When hosting people, the small size is undoubtedly an \nadvantage. Firms should try to protect and infuse in every aspect of their operations the \nwarm and friendly atmosphere and service that they are able to offer. Courtesy and \nhonesty may not improve significantly the relationships with intermediaries, but they \ndefinitely produce satisfied customers and valuable repeaters. These two segments of \ncustomers are a very valuable starting point for SMTEs. Additionally, they should \npursue a constant increase of their quality standards, despite the \u201cdimotivation\u201d by large \nTOs. Another key to success is the development of a healthier distribution and clientele \nmix, even at the expense of short-term profitability. The co-operation with more TOs is \na definite advantage for firms that want to ameliorate their reliance on certain channel \nmembers. It is wise to set both maximum and minimum limits concerning the \npercentage of the rooms that will be given to each \u201cwholesaler\u201d. By contracting \nsignificant percentage of the firm\u2019s capacity to only one TO, SMTEs put themselves \nfurther in the dependency channel. They should also pursue to maximise their direct \nselling by investing on the one hand in the opportunities given by modern Information \nTechnology; on the other hand to the positive \u201cword of mouth\u201d and repeated clientele \nthat is generated by satisfied customers. Very promising is also the enhancement of the \nco-operation with smaller niche TOs. This could be achieved mainly by SMTEs that can \n32\nspecialise their offer. It would might not offer much better profits due to the higher cost \nof specialisation, but it would definitely optimise the average number of co-operating \nTOs and the quality of the overall relationship with them. Additionally, a \u201ctailored \nmade\u201d product gives to the SMTE increased opportunities to develop a solid base of \nloyal clientele, since it increases the firm\u2019s ability to satisfy customers\u2019 needs and \ndecreases the substitutability of the firm. Also, it is evident that SMTEs should avoid \nexclusivity contracts, and apply a balanced use between commitment\/allotment \ncontracts. As interviewees noted, both exclusivity and commitment contracts seem to be \nthe first step towards management contracts or acquisition in a future stage. They not \nonly weaken any possibility of the firm to improve its position, but also spoil the market \nconditions for other SMTEs in the same destination. Of course there are sometimes \ncertain parameters that push SMTEs to sign such agreements, such as in extremely \ndifficult tourism seasons or in destinations with extremely acute overcapacity problem. \nEven then it should be kept a balance between commitment and allotment contracts. \nFinally, SMTEs depending on their size should try to attract as many nationalities as \npossible. This will allow them to split the risk of potential origin market recession by \nco-operating with macro-economically independent markets. In these cases, however, \nSMTEs\u2019 owners\/managers should also keep in mind that not all the nationalities have \nharmonic coexistence or compatible tastes in terms of facilities, catering, animation etc. \n \nModern business trends promote concentration and strategic co-operation as the main \ndeterminants of the future structure of almost all the industries. Tourism is not an \nexception to this rule. It is almost inevitable for SMTEs to avoid their partaking in \nconcentration trends, either as small firms\u2019 consortia or as parts of a large travel \norganisation in the future. Operationally, small size is a drawback; hence SMTEs should \nexplore every opportunity they have to develop their own scale and scope economies. \nThere are very few SMTEs that could potentially act independently and achieve a \nconsiderable improvement in the balance of power. Even for these firms, however, \npotential collaboration with other partners has only to offer. Although all interviewees \nappreciated the potential benefits of collaboration, they attributed the failure of similar \nprevious attempts to the inappropriate idiosyncrasy among the owners and the managers \nof small firms.  \n \nSMTEs\u2019 strategic options to collaboration could have at least three dimensions: \n33\n1. Economies of scope, through:\n\u2022 Neighbouring SMTEs\u2019 collaboration to improve their facilities and enhance their \nservices on offer. This is an extremely viable option for low category \nneighbouring enterprises, that could pull resources to develop a shared facility \ni.e. swimming pool, sport facilities etc. \n \n2. Economies of scope and scale, through:\n\u2022 Vertical SMTEs\u2019 Networks that could take the form of SMTEs\u2019 independent \nbusiness consortia with regional basis, which could pull together forces.  \nFor instance, private SMTEs in a given destination\/resort\/locality, that their specific \noperations act complementarily (Corfu Island, City of Corfu etc) could collaborate to \npromote the resort or the destination. They could also establish patterns of mutual co-\noperation in order to maximise the impacts of the tourism package to the host economy. \n \n\u2022 Horizontal SMTEs\u2019 Networks that could take the form of SMTEs\u2019 independent \nbusiness consortia with sectoral basis, which could pull together forces.  \nFor instance, private SMTEs of the same sector, irrespective of the firms\u2019 location (i.e. \nGreek spa tourism SMTEs, SMTEs with disabled-friendly facilities, SMTEs of the same \ncategory etc.) could collaborate to form a hotel-chain, or to order their supplies \ncollectively.  \n \nThere are significant benefits from such collaboration, such as co-operative \nmanagement and marketing of enterprises at resort and sector level. SMTEs could take \nadvantage of economies of scale and scope in supplies, maintenance, contracts and \nmarketing. A consortium of SMTEs could more easily develop a common brand name \nand take some control of the projected image of the brand. In addition, they will have \nincreased ability to utilise effectively Information and Communication Technologies to \nmarket and distribute their product. The main weakness of this attempt is the need for \nharmonisation of standards and processes among the collaborating enterprises, \nespecially in the quality of the product offered. At a later stage the development of this \ncollaborative attempt to a chain of hotels or apartments is not unfeasible. This again \ncould be pursued by accommodation establishments of the same destination or by \naccommodation establishments with similar offer. Besides the previously mentioned \neconomies there are additional advantages accruing from such an attempt: centralised \n34\nand coordinated marketing and management and enhanced negotiation power due to \nlarger number of rooms and representation in more resorts, hence more beneficial \nagreements.  \n \n3. Enhancement of collaboration between SMTEs and their National and Regional \nrepresenting bodies and associations. \nThe former ways of collaboration could bring together firms with similar problems \nand strategic options. The latter \u2013is more massive and impersonal- but it is definitely \nmuch more efficient in shouldering tasks difficult to be performed by private sector \nbusinesses (such as: comprehensive information intelligence), and more adequate for \nlobbying and putting pressure on the State or on larger organisations. Potential efforts \nby representing bodies could include (Figure 7): \n35\nFigure 7: SMTEs\u2019 National\/Regional representing bodies and associations. Their \npotential areas of success  \nBreak the isolation of SMTEs from market evolutions and trends  \n\u2022 Information intelligence on market trends, booking patterns \n\u2022 Gathering accurate statistics and detailed databases \n\u2022 Conducting valuable market research that could help associations to provide guidelines to their firms \nconcerning markets and segments with optimistic prospects to be targeted \n\u2022 Analyse the current supply, and provide recommendations and advice on future planning of tourist \ninvestments, by constructing capacity maps for their firms (location, sizes, categories, profitability per \nroom, return on investment per room, seasonality  etc)   \nEstablishing guidelines in SMTEs\u2019 pricing policies \n\u2022 Suggesting minimum price limits for both allotment and commitment contracts \n\u2022 Develop collective yield management systems \n\u2022 Initiate programmes of central negotiations with TOs \nFacilitate promotion and distribution of destinations\/resorts \n\u2022 It is impossible for an association to promote all its SMTEs, however it could promote areas and sectors \n\u2022 Develop internet portals \n\u2022 Develop RRSs (Regional Reservation Systems) \n\u2022 Provide basic I.T. training and support to the SMTEs \n\u2022 Develop links with central web portals and reservation systems \nFacilitating the marketing attempts of SMTEs \n\u2022 Develop common promotional platform for the destination to provide guidance to the independent \npromotional efforts of SMTEs. SMTEs may not have large promotional budgets but they are definitely \nnumerous. Their independent and unorganised promotional efforts are a \u201cshot to nothing\u201d, but if their co-\nordinated under similar messages and slogans, they could result to much better market awareness and \nimage of the destination\/resort  \n\u2022 Enhance direct link with customers by developing direct marketing techniques for specific destinations or \nresorts (direct mail to consumers is a viable option in certain geographical and sectoral contexts) \n\u2022 Promote and develop frequent\/loyal costumers programmes and clubs \nEnhancing the accessibility options  \n\u2022 Put pressure for the establishment of a small but stable network with main tourism generating markets \nand neighbouring to the destinations countries \n\u2022 Explore the synergies with low-frill airlines and independent travel agencies in origin markets \nEstablish common legal representation  \n\u2022 Legal representation offices at the origin countries to shoulder in bulk the numerous cases of SMTEs\u2019 \ndemands and losses. Especially, the numerous small cases are perceived to be expensive and some times \nunprofitable for individual firms, since the court process takes place at the origin countries, and the \nexpenses do not allow owners to pursue them  \n\u2022 Put pressure to terminate the one-sided legal coverage in contractual agreements with T.O.s by pursuing \nimposition of penalties to financially or contractually inconsistent TOs \nPut pressure for regulation of the market  \n\u2022 Put pressure on TOs \n\u2022 Negotiate the regular (per week, fortnight month) provision of booking position to SMTEs by TOs  \nPut pressure to the State to support SMTEs.\n\u2022 Training programmes and courses \n\u2022 Financial support for the development\/expansion\/renovation of SMTEs facilities \n\u2022 Legal support  \n\u2022 Introduction of regulative guidelines by the State to E.C. \n\u2022 Incentives and developmental laws focusing on the improvement of SMTEs\u2019 tourism offering \n\u2022 Normal distribution of paid leaves for public sector employees, who represent a very considerable (more \nthan 30%) of total employment in the country. This segment is the real \u201cblood-donor\u201d of Greek SMTEs, \nand distribution of their free time to the shoulder months of the peak season could benefit significantly \nSMTEs through increased occupancy and decreased seasonal patterns  \nProvide guidelines for accommodation supply  \n\u2022 Promote co-operative efforts between SMTEs \n\u2022 Exploring opportunities to initiate collaboration with private sources of finance, to provide assistance to \nSMTEs\u2019 owners that develop or expand their tourism firm.  \n\u2022 Explore opportunities for SMTEs\u2019 financial assistance in order to avoid assistance from TOs \n\u2022 Provide incentives and guidelines to tackle fragmentation when it is damaging to the overall quality of the \ndestination\/resort. For example they can provide appropriate financial and technical support and guidance \n36\nto SMTEs to transform their tourism offer (i.e. transformation of three self-catering apartments to a \nluxurious villa) \n\u2022 Depending on the demand trends revealed by market research they could promote transformation of \nsupply to adapt to the needs (transformation of independent rooms to let to self-catering apartments) \nEnhance quality and relationships within the tourism distribution channel \n\u2022 Set standards, organise training and familiarisation programmes for the TOs\u2019 representatives. \n\u2022 Support the role of local incoming TO \n6. Conclusion \n \nNotwithstanding the fact that both the national and the international business \nenvironment are not ideal for SMTEs, some simple and necessary steps could influence \nsignificantly the balance of power to their favour. This specific approach acknowledges \nfirstly that the strategic weaknesses of SMTEs cannot be attributed entirely on state\u2019s \nomissions inefficiencies and secondly that the unfavourable market situation for SMTEs \nis solely created by TOs\u2019 interests. The first acknowledgement is in accordance with the \nexisting European fully liberalised economic system that reinforces the trends toward \nless state\u2019s intervention and more self-regulation of the free markets, motivating the \nprivate sector businesses to influence, be influenced and finally adapt themselves to the \nfast-moving business environment. The second statement acknowledges that both \nSMTEs and TOs are \u201cprofit maximisers\u201d. Since TOs are private sector businesses that \noperate in this fully liberalised economic system of capitalism and have as primary \ntarget to operate with optimum profits of every nature, is perfectly rational for them to \ntake as much advantage as possible of inadequately prepared businesses and \n\u201camateurish\u201d strategic planning, marketing and management. Therefore, tourism firms \nirrespective of their size can confront the unfavourable situation by reconsidering their \nstrategic vision and taking certain steps -first and foremost- towards the alleviation of \ntheir weaknesses. This is the most reliable way to strengthen their negotiating position \nagainst tourism intermediaries, enhance their tourism offer\u2019s marketing and distribution \nportfolio and achieve a considerable level of gradual \u201cindependency\u201d. \n \n37\nReferences\nA.B.T.A.
