But for all of us, even if in different ways \nand to different degrees, those things are being pulled apart. If you have lived, as I \nhave, in an even moderately busy urban street, it makes sense, even if a weird kind of \nsense, that you do not speak to the person, living two doors down from you, who \ntends to go to work at the same time as you, even if (as in one bizarre case that \nhappened to me) it turns out that person ends their journey to work only a few yards \nfrom where you do. On the other hand, it makes sense to experience and act out \nsignificant pleasure, when you meet only for the second time at a conference someone \nfrom a distant university with whom (apart from broad outlines of work \nspecialisation) your life and its milieu have almost nothing in common. So there are \ngood and bad sides, as always, to the stretching of time-space relations! But one effect \nis that any particular milieu is characterised by what the sociologist Martin Allbrow \nhas called \u2018time-space social stratification\u2019 (1997: 52): our paths move in parallel with \nthose of countless others we rarely see, so that, even when our paths do cross with \ntheirs, the encounter may seem random rather than meaningful. \n \nThere is good reason, then, to loosen the tie between \u2018community\u2019 and the defined \ngeographical area and, as Gerard Delanty (2003) argues in his useful recent survey of \nthe term, to allow for \u2018communication communities\u2019 which stretch in a huge range of \nways across space and time. To hold onto the assumption that community is based, at \na minimum, on the grouping of people in one place (as the Penguin Encyclopaedia of \nSociology still does: Abercrombie et al., 2000) is to condemn our definition to \nirrelevance. But the opposite is not true: relaxing our definition of community in this \nway does not guarantee its relevance, or not, at least, if it is relevance to \u2018politics\u2019 we \nwant. The term \u2018politics\u2019 is itself subject to continuous redefinition within debates \nover global human rights and cosmopolitanism.2 But, however we stretch and re-layer \nour concept of \u2018politics\u2019, the term is unimaginable without some meshing between, on \nthe one hand, the \u2018places\u2019 where we live, work and are governed and, on the other \nhand, the places where we share with others something that impinges on how we are \ngoverned, something that might provide the matter of politics. For, as Chantal Mouffe \nin her book The Democratic Paradox has argued, \u2018the logic of democracy does indeed \nimply a moment of closure which is required by the very process of constituting \u201cthe \npeople\u201d [which] cannot be avoided\u2019, even if from a philosophical perspective we now \ninsist on the paradoxical nature of that closure (Mouffe, 2000: 43). Democratic \npolitics, Mouffe argues, drawing on Wittgenstein, requires some \u2018form of life\u2019, that is, \na sufficient level of shared beliefs and \u2018practice . . . aimed at persuading people to \nbroaden the range of their commitments to others, to build a more inclusive \ncommunity\u2019 (2000: 65-66). Mouffe\u2019s use of the term \u2018community\u2019 is striking, even \nsurprising, in the deconstructionist context of her book, but the fact that she is driven \nto use it illustrates precisely the tension I now want to explore. \n \nThe Problematic \u2018Place\u2019 of the Political \n \nThis tension has troubled me in my own work on culture and media for some time. It \nis the conflict between two apparently irreconcilable pressures: on the one hand, the \n 2\npush to root out and deconstruct any notions of \u2018unity\u2019 or \u2018holism\u2019 lurking behind the \neveryday political language of \u2018society\u2019, \u2018state\u2019, \u2018culture\u2019 and \u2018community\u2019 (not least \nin their media glosses)3 and, on the other hand, the pull back towards some notion of \ncommonality without which any refounding of democratic politics seems impossible, \neven unimaginable. Where can we turn for the language, the concepts, the practices, \nthat might express this commonality without unity?4 Before I go any further, let me \nacknowledge that to put things this way \u2013 to foreground the preconditions of political \nengagement \u2013 might seem , to some, an intolerable diversion, if the ultimate goal is to \nlink back to politics itself. But it is a step that I believe is necessary, and one which \ncultural studies has an important role in helping us formulate effectively; I return to \nthe link back to politics as such at the end. \n \nTaken at face value, the terms in Raymond Williams\u2019 well-worn notion of \u2018common \nculture\u2019 seem unusable in resolving the tension I have outlined: \u2018common\u2019, because it \nassumes something held in common that we can no longer assume; and \u2018culture\u2019, \nbecause of its embedding in long-deconstructed metaphors of closure.5 But that does \nnot mean we can abandon the conceptual site which Williams intended the term \n\u2018common culture\u2019 to mark, which is why my title today tries to keep that site open. \nWe can at least hope that some new term might come to reoccupy this place; without \nthis, Williams was right, I believe, to say that \u2018we shall not survive\u2019 (1958: 304), or at \nleast democratic politics shall not survive.  \n \nHow can this conceptual site be characterised, which Williams filled with the term \n\u2018common culture\u2019? Mouffe writes of a contestatory democracy formed of \u2018friendly \nenemies\u2019, \u2018who are friends because they share a common symbolic space\u2019(2000: 13). \nBut she does not hint how that common symbolic space might be created or sustained. \nThis gap in her argument is symptomatic; it is common to both political science and \npolitical theory. We might hope for solutions in the fast-growing literature on \ncitizenship but for all its richness there is, as yet, as Thomas Janoski and Brian Gras \n(2002: 42) recently pointed out, nothing there that captures \u2018the informal aspects of \ncitizenship integrating both the public and private sphere\u2019, precisely the gap between \nlifeworld and public connection with which I began. Instead the value of citizenship \nstudies may lie in the nakedness of the questions it asks: \u2018what does it mean to belong \nto society . . .?\u2019 (Stevenson, 2002: 4), \u2018what counts as community and solidarity\u2019 \n(Elliott, 2002: 55)?  \n \nWhile such unanswered questions confirm the existence of a gap, I would want to go \nfurther and interpret this gap as symptomatic of a crisis in the practice of democracy \nitself, a crisis quite consistent with the survival (for now at least) of democratic \nvalues.6 This is partly a crisis in the dominant liberal model of democracy, which, as \nits critics (Pateman, 1970; Barber, 1984) have long argued, is a thin concept of \ndemocracy, capable of living with a permanently disengaged minority, but which \nfinds it harder to live with a disengaged majority (Wolin, 1992). But the crisis extends \nwider; it is a problem for all who want to work with an older language of politics, that \nhas been stretched beyond all recognition by the competing forces of \ndetraditionalization, individualization and globalization. As a result, the crisis applies \nequally to radical versions of democratic politics. Let me illustrate this by surveying, \nquite critically, some recent, mainly philosophical, interventions towards the \nredefinition of \u2018politics\u2019, or at least the preconditions of political engagement. \n \n 3\nJacques Derrida has provided, perhaps, the most vivid image of the crisis. In Politics \nof Friendship he writes of how \u2018the resonant echo of all the great [political] discourse\u2019 \nnow issues, increasingly, in \u2018mad and impossible pleas, almost speechless warnings\u2019. \nThese warnings turn endlessly \u2018like searchlights without a coast, they sweep across \nthe dark sky, shut down or disappear at regular intervals and harbour the invisible in \ntheir very light\u2019 (Derrida 1997: 81). For Derrida, the problem is a crisis in the nature \nof value itself, in \u2018the value of value\u2019 (ibid.). This cannot be addressed through some \nreworked democratic bond based on community, or \u2018fraternity\u2019, in any substantive \nsense, because it is the unsustainability of such political \u2018substances\u2019 that is the \nproblem. Instead Derrida recalls Aristotle\u2019s concept of \u2018friendship\u2019, but with a sense, \nderived from Blanchot, of mutual strangeness and separation (Derrida 1997: 294). But \nwhat contexts, what reference-points, does Derrida give us for thinking about this new \npolitics, and how it might be sustained? Apart from an enigmatic mention of \u2018a certain \nfaithful memory of democratic reason and reason tout court\u2019 (1997: 306), there is no \nclue.  \n \nNor, although many have turned to it for guidance, does the philosophy of Levinas \nprovide, I would argue, many hints as to how we might sustain, let alone extend, its \nrethinking of morality into social practice and the possible refounding of politics. The \nunconditional, asymmetrical responsibility which Levinas argues we have towards the \nOther who faces us is prior to any social or cultural process; it is built into the prior \nconstitution of the self. As Zygmunt Bauman puts it in his eloquent book Postmodern \nEthics, \u2018it is through stretching myself towards the Other that I have become the \nunique, the only, the irreplaceable self that I am\u2019 (1992: 77). But how is this abstract \nvision of morality, which rejects any basis in something as contingent as consensus or \nmutuality, connectable to the progressive \u2018remoralisation of human space\u2019 for which \nBauman calls (1992: 249, 240)?7  It is far from obvious. \n \nSomething of the same impasse affects Jean-Luc Nancy\u2019s evocation of \u2018the \ninoperative community\u2019 (1991). This \u2018community\u2019 is inoperative in the sense that it is \nsustained only through the absence of the rhetorical operations of reification, on \nwhich conventional notions of \u2018community\u2019 depend: \u2018it is the work that the \ncommunity does not do and it is not that forms community . . . Community is made of \nwhat retreats from it\u2019 (1991: xxxix). Like Levinas, Nancy turns to the originary \nconstitution of the self for value: our prior sense of \u2018being in-common\u2019 with others \nwhich is indissolubly tied to our knowledge of our and their mortality. We should \nbeware of exaggerating the novelty of these formulations; the insistence on the \nnecessary intersubjectivity of the self goes back at least to the 1930s US pragmatist \nGeorge Herbert Mead.8 What is new here, however, beyond the elegantly paradoxical \nlanguage, is not obviously helpful. For, by contrast with the US pragmatists like Mead \nand Dewey who connected philosophical issues to the social and cultural bases of \ndemocratic education and politics, Nancy turns his back on this: \u2018community\u2019 he \nwrites \u2018is the unworking of work that is social, economic, technical and institutional\u2019 \n(1991: 31, added emphasis). \u2018Community\u2019, for Nancy, is something to be explored in \nthe experience of seeing a friend die or in the philosophical foundations of literature, \nbut not in anything that might readily be recognised as politics. Only one clue is \noffered, when Nancy addresses the word \u2018political\u2019 itself:  \n \n\u2018\u201cPolitical\u201d would mean a community ordering itself to the unworking of its \ncommunication, or destined to this unworking: community consciously undergoing \n 4\nthe experience of its sharing . . . undergoing, in whatever manner, the experience of \ncommunity as communication\u2019 (1991: 40-41).   \n \nOnce again, there is an echo of pragmatism: recall John Dewey\u2019s definition of \ncommunication as \u2018the way in which people come to possess things in common\u2019 \n(quoted Carey, 1989: 22). Nancy\u2019s idea, however, of a community that undermines, \nrather than simply sustains, its own \u2018unity\u2019 is an important one to which I return.  \n \nFfor a less paradoxical account of the potential commonality that might ground any \nnew politics, we can turn to work influenced by psychoanalytic conceptions of the \nself, not just in France but in Germany, Italy and the US. Kristeva\u2019s proposal that we \nbe more open to strangers by becoming \u2018strangers to ourselves\u2019 (1991) is well-known, \nbut similar connections between a more inclusive politics and the interrogation of the \nself have been developed by Axel Honneth (1995) and Jessica Benjamin (1998). It is \na powerful line of argument, since it confronts the intense investment in exclusion, \nthat, whether or not you think within a psychoanalytic framework, is plausibly central \nto the constitution of the subject. Alessandro Ferrara (1998) has gone further and \nargued that psychoanalytic insights into the healthy subject can provide an intuitive \nbasis for a new vision of \u2018the good\u2019, that translates Aristotle\u2019s species-based notion of \nthe \u2018good for man\u2019 into a shared, but always individually worked-out, value found in \nthe richness of the life-narrative. At least one problem with this is that psychoanalytic \nperspectives on the self are themselves normalizing; they are based on a standard of \nthe healthy, fulfilled self, which is hardly consensual, and that I, for one, would want \nto contest.  \n \nThese psychoanalytic accounts, however, represent a major step forward away from \nthe abstractions of the \u2018originary constitution of the self\u2019 to questions of process \u2013 the \nprocesses, including narrative processes, through which selves emerge and evolve \ntheir reflexive understanding. This connects with the political sociologist Alain \nTouraine\u2019s (2000) attempt to transvalue the standard terms of democratic discourse \n(\u2018freedom, solidarity, equality\u2019) for a world where the nation as a founding \u2018essence\u2019 \nis neither desirable nor plausible. The way forward, Touraine argues, is through a new \nattention to \u2018the Subject\u2019:  \n \n\u2018 . . . we have to replace the old idea of democracy, defined as participation in the \ngeneral will, with the new idea of institutions that safeguard the freedom of the \nSubject and permit communication between Subjects\u2019 (2000: 14).  \n \nBut what might these communicative institutions be? Or, more modestly, on what \nprinciples can they even be imagined? Once again, we are offered few clues by \nTouraine beyond this general statement. \n \nThe only writer who I have found to offer a way forward here is the philosopher and \nnarrative theorist, Paul Ricoeur. For Ricoeur, the self is always a narrated self: the self \nsubsists through the never-completed stories it tells of itself. More than that, my \nindividual story can never be sealed off from the stories others tell of themselves: \u2018the \nlife history of each of us is caught up in the histories of others\u2019 (Ricoeur 1992: 161). \nThis means that, in principle, each of us is disposed to be interested in the stories of \nothers. What blocks, Ricoeur argues, a more open narrative exchange is the rigidity of \ncollective identity, its tie to a founding event which must be kept unchanged, indeed \n 5\n\u2018incommunicable\u2019, to perform its political work (Ricoeur 1995: 7, quoted in Kaplan \n2003: 97). In rejecting the closure underlying collective identities, Ricoeur follows all \nthe other writers I have discussed, but crucially he goes further in suggesting some \nspecific practices that might allow us to move beyond such unsatisfactory identities. \nOne is what Ricoeur calls a \u2018translation ethos\u2019 (or \u2018language of hospitality\u2019), that is, \nan openness to each other\u2019s narrative languages. Another is the \u2018exchange of \nmemories\u2019, that offer conflicting accounts of overlapping events. We need, Ricoeur \nimplies, institutions where, across apparent differences of collective identity, we can \nexchange narratives of past experience that, through their exchange, encourage shared \nnarratives of the future.9  \n \nAll this might seem to take me very far from the proper domain of a sociologist! But, \nas Touraine points out, if the crisis of democratic values runs as deep as many \nincluding him suggest, we cannot go on describing the social and political world as if \nnothing is changing. The very purpose of sociology, of critical social analysis in \ngeneral, is at stake (2000: 11; cf Honneth, 1995: 207).  \n \nSo, to sum up my argument so far, we need a language and a practice (or form of life) \nthat can connect across our anxious cross-disciplinary searches, first, for the \nregrounding of ethics and morality, second, for new models of democratic politics, \nand, third, for new analytic concepts for critically understanding the social world. In \nthis spirit I want to ask what contribution cultural studies might make to developing \nthat common language and practice. \n \nThe Common Space of Cultural Studies \n \n1. Research Priorities  \n \nRight away, let me stress that I have no illusions that cultural studies, more than any \nother academic subject, carries some automatic political force (there is no role now, as \nBauman (1987) pointed out, for academic \u2018legislators\u2019; so an academic subject\u2019s \npolitical  \u2018force\u2019 must be generated through the specific and practical connections it \nmakes to the world beyond it). Nor do I have too many illusions about the difficulties \nwhich the intensified rationalisation of contemporary academic life poses for such a \npolitical practice, particularly when cultural studies itself, as we saw at Birmingham \nin summer 2002, is a specific target of just those pressures. Nor, given the wider \nproblem, precisely, of making connections between specialised forms of life, does it \nmake sense to speak as if research and teaching can be reformed in isolation from \nshifts in practices outside the academy. Any principles we develop must open out into \nthe wider democratic dialogue that in my book Inside Culture (2000: 140) I tried to \ncapture through the phrase \u2018community without closure\u2019 \u2013 a phrase that was itself \nunspecific, I admit, but to which I want to try and give some substance here.  \n \nIn doing so, I will be arguing for a research agenda for cultural studies that is rather \ndifferent from its current one: this is intended not so much as a judgement on cultural \nstudies\u2019 past, as a proposal that if cultural studies is to contribute more concretely to \nthe crisis of democratic politics than some of the philosophical positions that I have \ncriticised, it must change its priorities. \n \n 6\nSo how, given these qualifications, might we imagine the contribution of cultural \nstudies? By cultural studies, I mean, since the question of cultural studies\u2019 disciplinary \nstatus seems permanently unresolved,10 the range of work across the social sciences \nand humanities that acknowledges the inspiration of cultural studies. \n \nLet\u2019s start with two points. First, we must be realistic: such is the fragmentation of the \nintellectual public sphere, in Britain at least, and cultural studies\u2019 dispersed and \nlargely marginal position within it, that no single intervention is ever likely to have \nthe impact that Raymond Williams\u2019 book Culture and Society did in 1950s Britain. A \nmore differentiated network of interventions is needed that is open in multiple ways to \nexchanges beyond conference hall and teaching room: in how cultural studies \nconceives the research work appropriate to it, in how it translates that research into \nwriting and other interventions, in how it disseminates that research and feeds it into \nideas for further research and wider non-academic dialogue. It follows (and this is the \nsecond point) that it makes no sense for cultural studies to limit its questions to those \nthat arise in an academic framework, ignoring the most urgent issues that face the \nsocial and political world, including the very crisis in democratic politics that I have \nbeen discussing. \n \nLooking back to the situation faced by Raymond Williams, there is a striking parallel, \nas well as enormous differences. Williams articulated better than most around him the \ncoming democratic crisis in a post-war society rigidly stratified by class, a Britain far \nfrom achieving the \u2018new common experience\u2019 that at the dawn of the welfare state T. \nH. Marshall (1992\/ 1949: 33) had seen as central to its stable pact of citizenship. \nMarshall had used the terms \u2018culture\u2019 and \u2018common experience\u2019 in a cryptic way, but \nby forging those terms into the critical concept of \u2018common culture\u2019, Williams cut \ninto the less than democratic languages and cultural politics of his day.  \n \nThe crisis of democratic politics is far from over (hence the continuity with Williams), \nbut the forms and conceptual tools through which it can be addressed are necessarily \nvery different after five decades in which the landscape of capacities and experiences \nwe call \u2018culture\u2019 has been massively de-stratified in some respects and relentlessly \nindividualised in others. The issue remains the building of connections to resist the \nfragmentation of the \u2018world of discourse\u2019 (Williams, 1968: 133), but the divisions to \nbe resisted are not so much the barriers of taste that differentiate types of cultural \nwork from each other, but rather the divisions that block off the sites of possible \npolitics from the rest of life (Bauman, 1999: 2).  \n \nThere may now, in other words, be much less at stake in the general term \u2018culture\u2019 \nwhose use, after all, has been endlessly expanded and whose political weight has been \ndeconstructed to death (which is how I read the upshot of Tony Bennett\u2019s (1998) \nwork); and much more at stake in the idea of \u2018common culture\u2019, or at least (as I put it \nearlier) in the conceptual site that Williams intended to mark by that apparently \ndefunct phrase. For what is urgent now is not defending the full range of cultural \nproduction and consumption from elitist judgement, but defending the possibility of \nany shared site (whether or not overlapping with specialised spheres of cultural \nproduction) for an emergent democratic politics. The contemporary mission of \ncultural studies, if it has one, lies not with the study of \u2018culture\u2019 (already a clich\u00e9 of \nmanagement and marketing manuals), but with the fate of a \u2018common culture\u2019, and its \ncontemporary deformations. \n 7\n \nThere are many ways of developing this insight into specific research. One - perhaps \nthe most direct which is not to claim it is necessarily the best - is to look for new \nempirical routes into the problem of \u2018the political\u2019, as it is currently experienced and \nconstructed; to examine how, from a host of different perspectives, \u2018the political\u2019 is \nbeing constituted, reformed and suppressed. Already there is work on the discourses \nof \u2018politics\u2019 in circulation, or, just as important, not in circulation (for example, Engin \nIsin\u2019s Foucauldian work on the construction of citizenship, or Henry Giroux\u2019s and \nLoic Wacquant\u2019s analyses of the displacement in US politics of issues of \u2018race\u2019 and \nexclusion).11 Indeed, turning specifically to the term \u2018community\u2019, it is some years \nsince Nikolas Rose (1996) explored this word\u2019s mobilisation in refiguring and \ndesocialising the language of government. I want here, simply because it is closer to \nmy own style of research, to focus on work with potential political subjects. Political \nsubjects are important, because in their reflexivity can be sensed the local rhetorical \nwork to which \u2018the political\u2019 and related terms are being put, or not put, and what, if \nanything, those subjects feel might still be at stake in these terms.  \n \nThis is an area where, with Sonia Livingstone and Timothy Markham at LSE,12 I am \nabout to embark on a ESRC-funded project called \u2018Media Consumption and the \nFuture of Public Connection\u2019. This project is definitely not aimed at reinforcing the \nrigid assumptions about the place or nature of politics that characterise most political \nscience. Rather it will take a broadly social constructionist13 approach to politics, \nasking people who are not necessarily active in the formal political process for their \nreflections on where, if anywhere, a sphere of public connection lies beyond the \nprivate domain, and whether, if at all, media are involved in sustaining that \nconnection. \n \nThis will be a difficult project because, without denying the concern for the future of \ndemocratic politics that motivates it, we as researchers must avoid assuming we know \nbetter than anyone else where and even whether politics has a future. \u2018Where\u2019, \nbecause as Larry Grossberg argued in his unjustly neglected book We Gotta Get Out \nof This Place:  \n \n\u2018the analyst cannot assume that she or he already knows the proper locations at \nwhich people should invest themselves and construct their belongingness. Nor can \nhe or she assume that the connections between such sites are always given in \nadvance, so that people\u2019s travels through daily life are predictable.\u2019 (1992: 110) \n \nWe cannot assume \u2018whether\u2019 politics has a future, because that would be to ignore the \nparticular privilege of the researcher as knowledge-producer (cf Bourdieu 2000) \nwhose socially established role is precisely to elicit \u2018opinions\u2019 about matters already \nconstructed as important in advance from the vantage-point of academic \ninterpretation, whether or not they matter to the subjects of that research.14 This is \nwhy the best empirical studies of political alienation and disconnection \u2013 those on \nwhich I hope our new project will be able to build - leave it ambiguous whether such \npositions are rational in the face of entrenched inequalities, including the fundamental \npolitical inequality between those who act (but may not listen) and those who \n(normally) are acted upon (Croteau, 1995; LeBlanc 1999; Buckingham 2000).15  \n \n 8\nThis, however, is just one possibility. There are many other ways to research the \ncurrent fate of \u2018the political\u2019 and, in order not to close down our sights unnecessarily, \nwe should take seriously the exclusions which the term \u2018political\u2019 itself entrenches. \nOne possibility would be to shift the focus away from individuals studied in the \nartificial situation of \u2018pure\u2019 research, and towards the institutional contexts in which \npeople and systems mobilise, negotiate, and displace \u2018the political\u2019 and related terms. \nCultural studies could do more, I suggest, to study institutional sites of discourse that \nare a long way from the formal process of \u2018politics\u2019 as usually conceived, yet hardly \ndivorced from questions of \u2018the political\u2019 or \u2018community\u2019:16 hospitals and schools, for \nexample, as sites of formal work and voluntary work, both of them nodes in complex \nregulatory processes and spaces where class, educational and ethnic differences are \ndaily negotiated.  \n \nThere are, in fact, many sites where cultural studies could be bolder in its \ninterventions: the whole range of work settings where in various ways \u2018the political\u2019 \nis negotiated or evaded. But, as soon as we think this, it becomes clear that it cannot \nbe enough to study those sites in isolation from the wider life-trajectories of those \nwho pass through them \u2013 because \u2018the political\u2019 may be precisely what is excluded or \nmarginalised in the sphere of \u2018work\u2019, and many sites of leisure too.  \n \nTo grasp this, attention must be paid to \u2018politics\u2019 in a different sense, the politics of \nspeech or voice: the distribution, probably highly uneven, of people\u2019s sense (not \nnecessarily directed to any space called \u2018politics\u2019) of themselves as effective agents \nand legitimate voices. Conventional political science has long travelled this coast in \nresearching \u2018civic culture\u2019 and \u2018subjective efficacy\u2019 (Almond and Verba, 1963), but it \nhas rarely gone far inland. We approach here the territory of \u2018identity politics\u2019, \nusually discussed at the level of group allegiances. But in times when, for some, the \nvery meaning of \u2018community\u2019 or \u2018belonging\u2019 is at issue (see quotes from Stevenson \nand Elliott earlier), we cannot limit our research to identities legitimated by group \nmembership, unless we are prepared to ignore the space of individual uncertainty that \nlies beyond them. Nor, if we understand identities as, in a sense, \u2018chosen\u2019, should we \nignore how people\u2019s capacities to choose - or even their capacity to imagine \nthemselves as agents who might choose - are shaped by the largely involuntary \ncontexts of everyday work. This was brought home to me when, in a pilot for our \nESRC study, involving questions posed to the UK\u2019s Mass-Observation Archive Panel, \na recently retired female nurse wrote in her response:  \n \n\u2018if my views counted for nothing after 50 years doing the job I knew about, why \nshould they count about other things I know less about?\u201917  \n \nTo be fair, these, as it were subterranean, connections between the crisis of formal \npolitics and the undemocratic politics of work are beginning to be sensed within \npolitical science and political sociology (Bennett, 1998; Turner, 2001), but have not \nso far generated much empirical research.18  \n \nCultural studies, in the broad sense I defined it, has, I believe, a great deal to \ncontribute here. This might sound a long way from some versions of cultural studies. \nIt does not foreground as such cultural consumption or identity-expression through \ncultural consumption; nor does it foreground as such processes of cultural production \n\u2013 not because they are unimportant (although, as I suggest, less may be directly at \n 9\nstake in these areas than once was the case), but because it aims to cut across those \ndomains to foreground another set of questions about the intertwined fates of \nindividual agency and democratic politics. In doing so, cultural studies is not ceding \nits territory to a revamped political sociology (in case this sounds like a reverse \nimperialism!), but rather bringing to the inter-disciplinary question of the \npreconditions of democratic politics its interest in agency and voice, and the forces \nthat constrain them (cf Couldry, 2000: chapter 3), a contribution which needs to be \nheard clearly and by a wider audience. Cultural studies, of course, cannot here work \non its own: the alliances it makes with other disciplines, on the face of it more directly \nconcerned with the stuff of politics, are equally crucial. But before turning to that, \nfirst let me explain what I believe has to change in how cultural studies sees it own \npractice. \n \n2. Practice \n \nThere are plenty of potential spaces for politics, perhaps, but the key lack in the \npolitical domain may now be time, not space (Turner, 2002: 28). In a wonderful essay \non the significance of rhetoric, the philosopher Hans Blumenberg wrote that \u2018what has \nbeen designated in our tradition as \u201crationality\u201d has almost always benefited the \nelement of acceleration . . . rhetoric, on the other hand, is, in regard to the temporal \ntexture of actions, . . . a consummate embodiment of retardation\u2019 (1987: 444-445). As \na result: \n \n\u2018a disproportion has arisen between the acceleration of processes and the feasibility \nof keeping a \u201cfeel\u201d for them, of intervening in them with decisions, or coordinating \nthem, through an overview, with other processes  . . . [so that] There is something \nlike the expediency of what is not expedient . . .\u2019 (1987: 445-446) \n \nThe resonance of this comment for the hyper-rationalised world of early twenty-first \ncentury educational institutions hardly needs explaining, but the implicit challenge \nmust be articulated directly.  \n \nHenry Giroux in an eloquent lecture delivered last year \u2013 ironically enough in that \noften complacent seat of ancient learning, Oxford University \u2013 posed the question: \n \n\u2018How might public time, with its unsettling refusal to be fixed or to collapse in the \nface of corporate time, be used to create pedagogical conditions that foster forms \nof self and social critique as part of a broader project of constructing alternative \ndesires and critical modes of thinking, on the one hand, and democratic agents of \nchange, on the other?\u2019 (Giroux, 2003b: 160) \n \nCan cultural studies, then, through the dialogues that its research generates, aspire to \nbe one fragment of that imagined \u2018public time\u2019? That, following Giroux, is what I \nwant to argue. \n \nWe are not, to be clear, talking here about some version of public cultural provision \u2013 \nan important but very different debate. What is at stake is cultural studies\u2019 possible \nrole in sustaining practices of public connection: practices through which people\u2019s \nfragmented, uncertain, incomplete narratives of agency (and all our narratives are \ninherently incomplete, as Ricoeur reminds us) are valued, preserved, and made \n 10\navailable for exchange, while being related, analytically, to wider contexts of power. \nCultural studies could - and this was Williams\u2019 vision \u2013 contribute to sustaining \ndialogues that bridge the personal and the public, debate that engages with the current \nforms of politics and public culture (from music to film to literature to sport to spatial \ndesign), and the fragments of community embedded within them, while also being \nsharply critical, when necessary, of their contradictions and limitations. This is the \nspace that Henry Giroux calls \u2018public pedagogy\u2019, intending it to apply well beyond \nthe confines of academic institutions (Giroux, forthcoming); indeed this is a space \nwhose horizon must extend into the less structured exchanges of civil society (even if \nour view of it there is easily blocked), if it is to have any meaning.19 \n \nThis space should be characterised by what Ricoeur calls \u2018linguistic hospitality\u2019, \nproviding a threshold for the exchange of memories and narratives by self and others. \nIt would involve listening, as Ricoeur emphasises, across difference, but on this point \nwe can also go back to Raymond Williams, recalling what he says in Culture and \nSociety: \u2018wherever we have started from, we need to listen to others who have started \nfrom a different position\u2019 (1958: 320). But it would be a process which made no \nclaims to negate difference through false aspirations to completion or certainty. \nRemember how Raymond Williams sought to replace the false closures of mass \nculture thinking with a new uncertainty in cultural discourse: \u2018to the degree that we \nfind [that] formula inadequate for ourselves, we can wish to extend to others the \ncourtesy of acknowledging the unknown\u2019 (1958: 289, added emphasis). 20   \n \nThe public time of cultural studies might, of course, from one point of view - that of \nrationalisation and government \u2013 be \u2018inexpedient\u2019 (in Blumenberg\u2019s word). Indeed, it \nwould be a process that was \u2018inoperative\u2019 in Jean-Luc Nancy\u2019s sense, undoing the \nfalse work of discourses which seek to construct \u2018a unique and ultimate identity\u2019 out \nof the potential openness of communication (Nancy, 1991: xxxviii), working against \nthe sanctioned languages of \u2018people\u2019, \u2018nation\u2019, \u2018society\u2019, \u2018culture\u2019 and even \u2018identity\u2019. \nAs such, it would enact Nancy\u2019s enigmatic words about \u2018a community ordering itself \nto the unworking of its communication\u2019 while at the same time, and through that very \nprocess, \u2018consciously undergoing the experience of its sharing\u2019 (Nancy, 1991: 40).  \n \nNone of this, however, would matter much, if it were not embedded effectively within \na sphere of public action. It is here we confront the crux between the work, say, of \nPaul Ricoeur and that of Hannah Arendt. Arendt, from a conservative perspective \u2013 \nbut that does not, as Michael Warner (2002: 59) points out, make her insight any less \npowerful - saw in modernity \u2018the loss of the public realm\u2019 (1958: 55): the loss, that is, \nof an assured space of public significance where individuals can make sense of \nsacrificing their private time in order to speak to, and act in view of, others. Even if \nwe think this too pessimistic, cultural studies can contribute nothing to the crisis of \ndemocratic politics unless in the course of its work, it makes connections beyond \ntheory, within the space of politics itself. This is what I want to address in the final \nsection. \n 11\n \n3. The Link Back to Politics \n \nThe imaginability, within the space of theory, of such recent visions of the \npreconditions for a renewed politics tells us nothing about whether life contexts exist \nin which such a politics might take root as practice. Practice is where real agents, \nformed and operating under major constraints but always with a local sense of \npossibility, choose what to do with their scarce resources, including their time; what, \nyou might ask, can theories of narrative tell us about the choices which people in fact \nmake?  \n \nIndeed the \u2018problem\u2019 with individualization (and connected processes of \u2018de-\nsocialization\u2019 (Touraine, 2000), that have undermined older forms of social context, \ninstitutional and communal) is not that the social world has become drained of \nmeaning (a lack for theorists to fill in), but that it is saturated by personal and public \nmeanings whose trajectory, however, is more and more difficult to connect into any \nshared space of public action. The fear, derived from Arendt, that the public realm \nmay no longer even be compatible with contemporary living conditions, even if for a \nwhile it remains imaginable by theorists, is summed up by Oscar Gandy with \nnightmarish clarity when he writes that \u2018individuals may actually feel better about \nknowing less and less about the world around them\u2019 (Gandy, 2002: 452). What if, \nagainst this background, all cultural studies\u2019 sophisticated discussions about mutual \nunderstanding and questioning fed into, rather than challenged, this fragmentation of \nwhat I believe, following Habermas, we must go on calling the \u2018public sphere\u2019 \n(Habermas, 1989). \n \nI said earlier that it is, in part, through the connections it will make with the wider \nspace of politics that cultural studies can contribute to the democratic crisis. By way \nof conclusion, let me try to develop this point in two stages.  \n \nFirst, I want to answer the objection anticipated earlier that to spend so much time \nconsidering the preconditions of politics, as I have, is a diversion from the real matter \nin hand: politics itself. I have some sympathy with this: I have no liking for the \n\u2018politics\u2019 of academic writing that treats the sustaining of its own (relatively) \nprivileged voice as the substitute for political action. But we must also beware of \nbeing too impatient here. It is striking that the historic public realm Arendt describes \nas lost, perhaps irrevocably, shares one feature with the community that other thinkers \nfrom Williams to Nancy have been trying to envisage for the future. For the essential \nfeature of the \u2018public realm\u2019 is its \u2018publicity\u2019. Publicity in Arendt\u2019s sense, even if \ncouched in an older language, shares something important with those more recent \nvisions. Here is Arendt: \n \n\u2018being seen and being heard by others derive their significance from the fact that \neverybody sees and hears from a different position. This is the meaning of public \nlife.\u2019 (1958: 57, added emphasis)  \n \nThe ability to acknowledge and listen to narratives told from different positions is \ncrucial to the visions of Williams, Ricoeur, and Nancy. Which suggests two possible \nreadings of those recent visions of the preconditions for politics: either as doomed in \nadvance to search for something already lost or (the interpretation I prefer) as \n 12\nreturning in potentially a reinvigorated way to the path of a possible politics through \npublic practices of mutual respect (cf Sennett, 2003).  \n \nSuch practices of respect and mutuality must, of course, reach many sites and \nnetworks, from cultural production to formal politics to the world of work. What is \nneeded, however \u2013 and this is Arendt\u2019s essential insight \u2013 is that in some way, those \nsites are connected, through a multitude of links, into a public space of shared \nsignificance and meaning. This is the emergent space that I have, provisionally, called \na \u2018community without closure\u2019, a space that sustains practices of mutual openness to \nthe uncertain accounts we are able to give of ourselves. But the name matters much \nless than the way we conceive the purpose of that space, which, while falling short of \nthe achievement of politics, should enact one of its essential preconditions: that is, \ncitizens\u2019 mutual respect for each other\u2019s inalienable capacity to contribute as agents to \nthe public sphere. Cultural studies has, I believe, an important potential role in \nsustaining such a space.  \n \nBut this, of course, cannot be enough. There has to be a second stage at which cultural \nstudies connects with the specific spaces of politics itself and, at the same time, \nconnects with other disciplines working to contribute to the specific content of \npolitical debate. In disciplinary terms, the connection with political theory that \ninterrogates not so much the preconditions for, as the proper process of, politics \n(particularly deliberative democracy theory) is vital.21 So too is the connection with \nthe whole range of work across the social sciences and the policy arena that examines \nthe nature of contemporary inequality and power. For it is ultimately in terms of this \nlandscape that questions of voice and agency, and the violence done to them, matter; \nit is because the material conditions of speaking and acting in our own name are so \nunequally distributed that we must listen better to others; as Nancy Fraser (2000) has \neloquently argued, we cannot leave the politics of recognition dangling, permanently \ndisconnected from the politics of redistribution.  \n \nIn all this, of course, I have only begun to map what the contribution of cultural \nstudies \u2013 a differently focussed, differently connected cultural studies \u2013 might be both \nto the crisis of democratic politics and to the future practice of politics itself. The \nspecific contribution of cultural studies as a discipline, if taken by itself, can at best be \nmodest. But it would hardly be trivial \u2013 not if, through the way it conceives, writes \nand disseminates its research, cultural studies helps enact a \u2018public realm\u2019 (in \nArendt\u2019s quaint but useful phrase) where it makes sense for us, and as yet unknown \nothers, to exchange, critically and sceptically, the fragments left from earlier visions \nof \u2018politics\u2019 and \u2018community\u2019. How else, we might ask, could something new and \nworthy of the term \u2018politics\u2019 emerge?  \n 13\nReferences \n \nAbercrombie, N. et al. (2000).

I also am particularly grateful to Henry \nGiroux and David Hesmondhalgh for their helpful and detailed criticisms of an earlier draft. \n \n2\n For example Beck (1997, 2000), Held (1995), Sassen (2002). \n \n3\n See in particular my recent work on media rituals (Couldry, 2003). \n \n4\n Cf Corlett (1989) on \u2018community without unity\u2019. \n \n 17\n                                                                                                                                                                      \n5\n See Clifford (1990), Hannerz (1992) and for discussion Couldry (2000: chapter 5). \n \n \n6\n On the latter, see Inglehart (1997); Klingemann and Fuchs (1995), Dalton (2002). \n \n7\n Cf Ricoeur\u2019s attempt to displace Levinas\u2019 asymmetrical conception of morality within a broader, \nintersubjectively grounded ethics (Ricoeur 1992: 189-190, 337-340). \n \n8\n Cf Couldry (2000: 51) and Ferrara (1998: 14-15), discussing Mead (1940). \n \n9\n Cf James Tully\u2019s vision of multicultural constitutional politics (1995: 184). Note also that Ricoeur, \nlike Derrida, draws on Aristotle\u2019s concept of friendship and reciprocity (1992: 181-94), but in a more \nprecise and specific way. \n \n10\n For my view (that cultural studies is best conceived as a discipline or at least a distinct \nmethodological site), see Couldry (2000). \n \n11\n See Isin (2002), Giroux (2003a), Wacquant (2002).  \n \n12\n Thanks to the Economic And Social Research Council for their financial support for this project \n(under Research Grant number RES143-25-0011). I wish to emphasise that the gloss I offer here on the \nproject and its potential significance is my own, and not necessarily that of my colleagues on the \nproject. \n \n13\n Cf Neuman et al (1992), Gamson (1992). \n \n14\n Thanks to Tony Bennett for making this point in response to a related paper I gave at the 2002 \nCultural Returns conference at St Hughs College, Oxford. \n \n15\n Note, however, that this is quite different from arguing, along with some Foucauldian positions, that \n\u2018the political\u2019 is merely a construction and nothing else is at stake in the term beyond the ceaseless \nconstructions and discourses that play behind it. Much more helpful, if at first sight more \u2018traditional\u2019, \nis the work of Paul Ricoeur (see further below), which seeks to maintain connections between the \npolitical, morality and ethics, thereby avoiding the ultimate incoherence of Foucault\u2019s Nietzschean \nattempt to stand \u2018above\u2019 values (cf Taylor, 1986). \n \n16\n For the distinction between \u2018politics\u2019 and \u2018the political\u2019, see Wolin (1996). \n \n17\n For more details of this pilot, see Couldry and Langer (2003). \n \n18\n A fine exception is Croteau (1995). \n \n19\n Cf Williams\u2019 moving vision of adult education as a mutual process of transformation between \nteacher and taught, underwritten by their equality as citizens (Williams, 1993). \n \n20\n There is some similarity here with John Keane\u2019s \u2018post-foundationalist\u2019 notion of civil society \n(Keane, 1998: 53). \n \n21\n See for example Habermas (1989, 1996), Calhoun (1992), Benhabib (1996), Young (2000).  \n"}
