Introduction \nDuring the last 30 years the suprachiasmatic nu- \ncleus (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus has \nbecome one of the most studied regions of the cen- \ntral nervous system, due to strong evidence show- \ning that the circadian timing system is intrinsic to \nthis region (for a review see [1,2]). Over the last \ndecade in vitro studies with the brain slice tech- \nnique in the SCN has resulted in rapid progress in \ndetermining the endogenous clock properties of \n* Corresponding author, E-mail: Emei@unamvml .dgsca.- \nunammx. \nthe cluster of neurons and glia that comprise the \nSCN [3]. \nBased on frequency histograms 3 types of firing \npatterns have been described in SCN neurons: \nregular, irregular and bursting, all arising in the \nsame sample simultaneously [4,5]. Although the \naverage firing rate recorded from SCN neurons \nseems to maintain a circadian rhythm [6-91, little \nis known about why the firing patterns differ \ngreatly between cells at a given time. \nPrevious studies, using interspike interval distri- \nbution analysis (IIDA), have shown that some \nSCN neurons show a regular firing pattern that is \nwell fitted with a single narrow Gaussian function \n0020-7101\/95\/%09.50 0 1995 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

It has also been shown that the \nIIDA from those neurons exhibiting an irregular \nfiring pattern can be fitted by a log-norm function \n[51. \nIn this paper the presence of a new interspike in- \nregular patterns from totally random firings. \nHence, the experimental data are explained in a \ncoherent way. \n2. Experimental procedure \nterval distribution pattern in the rat SCN in vitro \nis reported. A careful analysis of the different \nmeasured patterns leads to a new classification, \nwhich enables one to envisage a model that ex- \nplains the functional relationship between the dif- \nferent neuron behaviours revealed by the experi- \nment. This theoretical model consists of a filtering \nof neural responses that leads to the generation of \nIn vitro electrophysiological recordings of single \nneurons in the SCN of 30 adult male Wistar rats \n(150-200 g) were performed. The animals were \nhoused on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle for 2 weeks \nwith food and water ad libitum. At different circa- \ndian times through the day, each animal was \nbeheaded under the lighting condition correspon- \nding to that time, the brain was quickly removed \n0 \u2018I 0 \nTIME (MINI \n0.5 1.0 \nTIME INTERVAL (S) \nFig. 1.

The pH was finely \ntuned by adjusting the NaHCO concentration at \nthe desired temperature, and the osmolarity was \nkept constant by modifying the NaCl proportion. \nUsing a tissue chopper, slices of 400 pm were cor- \nonally sectioned from the hypothalamic region, \ncontaining the SCN. Once in the recording \nchamber, the slices were preincubated for 30 min \nin Krebs solution at 37\u201dC, before recording the ex- \ntracellular activity of single neurons. Recordings \nwere made with glass micropipettes filled with 2M \nNaCl (4 to 10 MQ). During the experiments the \nslices were perfused continuously at a rate of 3 \nml\/min with Krebs solution kept at 37\u00b0C and \nbubbled with 95% 0, and 5% COz. \nFiring patterns from both SCN were recorded \nfor a total of 472 single cells. Of these, there were \n10 to 20 cells per slice. Each cell was monitored \nwith an oscilloscope for about 5 min to attain \nstability, and then recorded for at least 2 min on \na magnetic tape. The data were stored and analyz- \ned by means of a computerized system, which is \nable to discriminate random signals and to digitize \nthe spikes, making frequency and interval distribu- \ntion histograms. In order to have a wide and un- \nbiased statistical sample, the recording electrode \nwas advanced in steps of 50 pm and kept in such \na position for at least 5 min before moving it to the \nnext position. This procedure allows recording \nfrom a number of neurons which were initially si- \nlent when the electrode was first placed. Particular \ncare was taken to discriminate the individual \nrecordings by either the frequency and the shape \nof the responses, or by the location of the cells in \nthe SCN. \n3. Experimental results \nAll the cells recorded could be assigned to one \nof 4 typical types, according to their firing pattern \nand IIDA. Fig. 1 illustrates an example from each \nof the 4 groups. Fig. la represents a cell that fires \nregularly, that is, there is only one interspike inter- \nval of - 100 ms with a very small deviation. In Fig. \n1 b there is a totally irregular pattern, showing a \nbroad distribution of interspike intervals, and in \nFig. lc there is an example of a cell that is quiet for \nTable 1 \nFiring rates (mean f  S.D.) from the different neuronal pat- \nterns classified according to the bin rate and the IIDA \nNeuron type Firing frequency Fraction of \nP-W total (%) \nBin rate Regular* 5.94 f  1.89 23.1 \nIrregular 3.60 f  2.56 69.9 \nBursting 2.59 f  1.89 6.4 \nIIDA Tuned** 6.32 * 2.12 18.0 \nRandom** 3.38 CIZ 2.45 65.9 \nHarmonic** 4.46 f  2.64 16.1 \nTotal number of cells = 472. \nOverall mean frequency rate = 4.09 & 2.61. \n\u2018Scheffe test P < 0.05 with respect to the remaining patterns, \nF=46.41. \n**Scheffe test P < 0.05 among the 3 patterns, F = 35.43. \nperiods greater than 1 s and then exhibits bursting, \nfor small intervals of time. It is difficult to distin- \nguish this type of cell from the previous one from \nthe corresponding IIDA. All these patterns have \nbeen reported previously [4,5,10]. The neuron in \nFig. Id shows an irregular firing pattern and a \nbroad distribution of interspike intervals, but the \nresponse is grouped around multiples of a basic in- \nterval, and the weight of each group of harmonics \nfollows roughly the envelop of the random distri- \nbution of Fig. lb. This latter pattern was reported \nin a recent abstract [ 111. \nFor reasons that will become apparent later, \nbased on the IIDA one should consider only 3 \nqualitatively different patterns: the random broad \nasymmetrical patterns, as in Figs. lb and Ic, the \nharmonic patterns, as in Fig. Id, and the tuned \npatterns, as in Fig. la. The descriptive statistics on \nthe firing rates from each neuronal type and from \nthe total population are presented in Table 1. For \ncomparison purposes the neurons were classified \nwith either criteria (firing pattern or IIDA). The \nproportion of each neuronal type varied according \nto the criteria used for classification. When the \nIIDA was used, a decrease in the proportion of \nregular firing neurons (tuned) and an increase in \nthe harmonic ones were observed. \nIt is worth mentioning that the harmonic pat- \nterns differ among themselves not only in the inter- \nval of the fundamental harmonic, but also in the \n26 \n28 \nc \nII? \n58 \nC \nL.

These sorts of patterns suggest a filtering mechanism of \nthe signals. \nrelative weight of the subsequent harmonic peaks, \nin such a way that one could think of a systematic \napproach to perfect tuning. The patterns of 4 cells \nare shown in Fig. 2 to illustrate this idea. \n4. Theoretical model \nThe following model suggests a possible mecha- \nnism by which one could obtain ideal oscillators \n(tuned rhythmic cells) from a random distribution \nof signals. There are 3 basic assumptions: \n(1) There are a large number of neurons in the \nSCN which fire spontaneously, completely at \nrandom. These cells act as a source of stimuli \nto excite other cells. In other words these cells \nare able to generate their own action poten- \ntials, without the need of an external input, \nrather like the automatism found in myocardi- \nal cells. However, these cells are irregular, \nwhereas myocardial cells have a strictly regu- \nlar firing pattern. \n(2) There is another type of neuron which primar- \nily responds to external signals coming from \ncells interconnected in a network. We shall \ncall these cells \u2018filters\u2019. The stimuli received by \none of these cells could come directly from a \nsource cell or another filter cell, since in the \nnetwork there would be paths in series and in \nparallel. We show later that it is not necessary \nto assume a particular network for the model \nto work. \n(3) The interneuronal transmission of signals is \ncarried out by means of a medium characteriz- \ned by a transmittance and an absorbance. \nThese characteristics could be changed by the \naction of an external agent, (e.g. chemical, \ntopological, etc.). Those terms have a precise \nmeaning in optics, when talking about con- \nduction of signals through a medium [ 121. In \nthe present context the transmittance and the \nabsorbance are related to the fact that only \nsignals with particular frequencies are absorb- \ned, other frequencies are reflected. \nWith these assumptions one could imagine a func- \ntional relationship between the various elements \ndefined: if one has a source of firings with a broad \ninterspike distribution, one could select a given in- \nterval between subsequent firings by means of an \nappropriate network of neurons that respond with \ndifferent delay times, depending on the character- \nistics of the intercellular transmitters which con- \nL. Zhang et al.\/fnt. J. Biomed. Comput. 38 (1995) 23-31 27 \nnect them, in a form analogous to a monochrom- \nator, or optical filter. At the end one should be \nable to filter all intervals, except the chosen one. \nThe first assumption can be readily tested. It is \nwell known [13] that if there is a large number of \nrandom events, and that if the probability (p) \ncharacterizing a given event is small, then the \nprobability W,(X) that the event occurs n times in \nN trials is given by the Poisson distribution \nW,(X) = -$ eex \nwhere X = Np is the mean number of events. In the \npresent case, one could safely state that if there are \nneurons that fire totally at random, then the prob- \nability that a given neuron fires 2 consecutive times \nin exactly an interval of time At is very small, and \nconsequently the probability distribution W,(X) is \ngiven by Eq. 1. In this case h = At\/to, where to is a \ncharacteristic time. At this level one should not \nassociate this characteristic time to a biological \nprocess and it should be taken as a parameter \ngiven by the experiment. \nFig. 3a shows a plot obtained by summing up all \nthe experimental patterns of types lb and lc in \nFig. 1, that is, all the patterns of the random type. \nThe vertical scale has been normalized by the area \nunder the curve and the horizontal axis is the time \ninterval X in units of to = 75 ms. This character- \nistic time was given by the maximum of the curve, \nwhich should be at 2to. In the same figure the the- \noretical curve W,(X) is plotted as a dashed line in \norder to compare with the experimental data. It is \nseen that the fit is reasonably good, except for a \npeak near zero in the experiments and a somewhat \nlarge tail at long intervals. \nIt is difficult to account for events separated by \nless than 10 ms in the present model. Therefore, \none might assume that the discrepancy near zero \nhas to do with processes occurring in the experi- \nment and not considered in the model, such as the \npossibility of nearly simultaneous external excita- \ntions and spontaneous firing of some silent cells, \nand we shall not comment further on this. Regar- \nding the long tails seen in the experiments, one can \nsay that a slight modification of the ideal condi- \ntions of randomness, or an insufficient collection \n0.300 \na) \n- EXPERIMENT NORMALIZED \nBY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF \nb) \n40.00 - \n30.00- 1 \n0.00 \n0.0 2.0 4.0 610 6.0 do 12:o 14.0 \nTIME INTERVAL a \nFig. 3.

The decreasing intensity after \nsubsequent filtering steps has no experimental significance. (c) \nComparison between the results of the theory, after 3 filtering \nprocesses and a typical experimental pattern of the kind shown \nin Fig. 2. The data were multiplied by an arbitrary constant to \ntit the intensities. \nof data, can modify the shape of the ideal curve ex- \nactly in this region. In other works [5] this kind of \nspectrum, obtained with a single neuron, has been \nadjusted with a log-norm distribution. It is clear \n28 L. Zhang et al. \/Int. J. Biomed. Comput. 38 (1995) 23-31 \nthat with a log-norm distribution one can lit an ar- \nbitrary asymmetrical curve very well, however, it is \npreferable to derive the form of the distribution \nfrom very simple assumptions, as was done here. \nThe second step in the model proposes that the \nfunctional reason for the existence of a source of \nrandom firings is to select specific time intervals, \nso that there will be some rhythmic signals to be \nused as components of a circadian oscillator \n[ 14,151. The selection of rhythms is naturally ac- \ncomplished by taking into account the assump- \ntions 2 and 3 in the following way: it seems \nreasonable to assume all neurons form a network, \nand therefore one expects interference between \nsignals arriving at a given neuron, depending on \nthe paths allowed by the network. Obviously, \nthese paths will depend not only on the array, but \nalso on the characteristics of the interneuronal me- \ndium, which certainly could be changed at any \ntime by other regulating factors. This would ex- \nplain the existence of harmonic and tuned firing \npatterns. The model is illustrated in Fig. 4. \nIn order to be specific, let us consider a one- \ndimensional array of 2 media N - M - N (see \nidealization in Fig. 4), each one characterized by a \ntransmittance T and an absorbance A, which are \nconnected through the relation T + R = 1 - A, \nL L \nwhere R is the reflectivity of medium M, due to the \nwalls separating the 2 media. Then, the trans- \nmitted signal from one side of the sandwich to the \nother is given by the Airy formula [12] \nW T Max \n- = 1 + Fsin2(6\/s) wo \n(2) \nwhere the maximum transmittance is \nTom, = T2 2= [l- (lfR)] \n(1 -RI \n(3) \nand the contrast factor is F = 4N(l - R). In ail \nproblems dealing with interference the important \nquantity is the phase 6. In the present case this \nphase should be related to time delays between dif- \nferent paths. Let us write the phase as \n6=2n x-g \ns + As \nwhere the variables h, g and s are times in units of \nlo. The parameter s gives the period of the fluctua- \ntion, and therefore it should be of the order of the \ncharacteristic time. This quantity could be chang- \ned by an amount As by modifying the chemistry of \nthe medium, or its \u2018refractive index\u2019. The quantity \nIA- \nFig. 4.

Zhang et al. \/Int. J. Biomed. Cornput. 38 (1995) 23-31 29 \ng takes into account any phase shifts, or time \ndelays, due to the walls. \nLet us now consider a series of sandwiches \nN - Mi - N - Mz -... - N - M,, - N, which cor- \nresponds to a 1-D transport problem through n \nfinite barriers [16]. The problem of various trans- \nport channels in parallel is equally tractable, but \nfor the sake of simplicity, consider only the array \nin series. Thus, one obtains a recursive formula \nC-1 \nTn= (1 4,~,)2 \n[l + Fn-, sin2(6,- i\/2)-\u2019 (5) \nThe final output (IV= W,T,) can be very com- \nplicated if the parameters of Eq. 2 vary at each \nstep, but the effect of filtering is already present if \none considers constant parameters, i.e. identical \nmedia. In Fig. 3b we plot the subsequent output \nafter the first, second and third filters. The par- \nameters used were T= 0.2, A = 0.2, s = 2.0, \nAs = 0.2, and g = 0.01, and the input signal was \ngiven by equation W2(h), multiplied by an ar- \nbitrary factor of 700 to give a reasonable scale. \nThese parameters fit some real data extremely \nwell. This is shown in Fig. 3c, where an experimen- \ntal pattern is compared with the output of the third \nfilter of Fig. 3b. Different shapes of patterns of the \nsort shown in Fig. 2 can be adjusted with different \nnumber of filters, and the ones in Fig. la can be \nobtained with 5 filters only. Similar filtering, or se- \nlection of frequencies, can be obtained with paths \nin parallel, but the final output depends on the \nparticular configuration of the various elements, \nand a calculation of this case would not be very in- \nformative. The important fact is that the tuning of \nthe firings does not depend on the specific details \nof the network. \n5. Discussion \nThere are different firing patterns in the cells of \nthe SCN, although at present, there is not a clear \nrelationship between the type of firing pattern and \nany morphological or functional characteristic of \nthe neurons. The clear finding of a harmonic type \nof firing pattern immediately suggests that a \nfrequency-filtering mechanism, that leads finally \nto perfectly tuned cells, is taking place in the SCN. \nThe proposed phenomenological model is able to \naccount for the appearance of all patterns \nmeasured in the SCN single cells, and suggests a \nfunctional relationship between the different types \nof behavior. \nThe main consequence of the model is that one \nis able to obtain a precise clock from not very \nprecisely defined components. It is worth mention- \ning that the selection of a function from an \noriginally random process is an efficient and ver- \nsatile mechanism frequently found in nature, that \nallows for the function to be performed even if a \nsubstantial number of the components are damag- \ned or not working. \nIt is important to emphasize that the model does \nnot address the question of circadian rhythmicity \ngeneration. However, we believe that it provides \nnew ideas which may be applicable to the study of \nthe mechanisms of circadian regulation, and that it \nalso serves as a complementary support to \nstatistical models and simulations [ 12,13,17]. Pre- \nvious models have suggested that one could get a \ncircadian cycle of extreme temporal precision, \neither by an interacting array of oscillators with \nfixed frequency [13,17,18], or without the need of \nprecise components [12,19], simply as the usual \noscillations caused by non-linear behavior found \nin systems out of equilibrium. None of these stud- \nies, however, has addressed the relationship of the \nmodel to the actual physiology of any known bio- \nlogical oscillator. \nBy combining the study of the clock mechanism \n(not addressed in this work) with the study of the \nmechanisms leading to the generation of different \nfiring patterns found in the SCN at any given time \n(which could be explained by the model presented \nhere) it may be possible to gain further insights on \nthe mechanisms of regulation. of circadian rhy- \nthmicity. At this point, however, the connection \nbetween cellular tiring and the generation of circa- \ndian oscillations, or the appearance of overt \nrhythmicity, is not straightforward, and beyond \nthe scope of this paper. \nIt seems that the coherent functional picture \ngiven by the model is in agreement with other \nexperimental facts. Firstly, it has been found that \nin a medium without calcium ions the regular fir- \ning patterns disappear, while the irregular ones \n30 L. Zhang et al. lint. J. Biomed. Comput. 38 (1995) 23-31 \npersist [20,21]. It is well known [22] that calcium \nions are essential for the synaptic transmission in \nthe SCN, therefore, these experiments support the \nidea that tuned patterns depend on synaptic pro- \ncesses, while the irregular patterns do not, since \nthey do not depend on external stimuli from other \ncells. There have been reports of the existence of \nchains of neurons and abundant local circuits \nwithin the SCN, which are consistent with the \nassumption that the neural networks needed for \nfiltering really exist [23,24]. Furthermore, im- \nmunohystochemical studies reveal an unusually \nlarge number of neuroactive substances and intrin- \nsic connections within the SCN [25]. The unusual \nabundance of activated glia in the SCN tissue \n[23,24] could be related to the important function \nof regulating the ionic composition of the extracel- \nlular medium [26,27] and thus could be capable of \nchanging the filter parameters. This is important if \none needs a flexible and adaptable clock. \nThe present model could be extended by in- \nvestigating the real meaning of the time parame- \nters in it. One could suggest an experiment in \nwhich one changes the chemical composition of \nthe extracellular medium, in particular, the con- \ncentration of ions that modify the synaptic pro- \ncesses, and compare the.experimental observations \nwith the predicted modifications of the harmonic \npatterns. It is encouraging that the value of g \n(which gives the frequency of the filtered signal) is \nO.Olt,, that is 0.75 ms. This is within the limits of \nthe measured times a signal takes to cross the \nsynaptic junction (0.5-l .O ms). \nThe model implies a modulatory mechanism of \nsynaptic transmission at the level of the filter neu- \nrons, which could be either internally or externally \nregulated. The first case would imply that the filter \nneuron could have a clock mechanism which \nwould affect the process at the level of receptor \ndynamic (number, affinity or coupling to ionic \nchannels or second messenger system). In the sec- \nond case, the filter network would be regulated by \ninputs from other neurons which could affect the \ntransmission process either by presynaptic (regula- \ntion of transmitter release) or post-synaptic \n(spatial or temporal summation) processes. In \nboth cases the outcome would be interference in \nthe transmission of neuronal impulses from the \nsource to the output neurons. \nAcknowledgements \nL.Z. was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship \nfrom the Consejo National de Ciencia y Tec- \nnologia of Mexico. \nReferences \n111 \nPI \nt31 \n141 \nt51 \nEl \n[71 \n181 \nPI \n[lOI \n1111 \n1121 \n1131 \nv41 \nMeijer JH and Rietveld WJ: Neurophysiology of the \nsuprachiasmatic circadian pacemaker in rodents, Physiol \nRev, 69 (1989) 671-707. \nMoore RY: The suprachiasmatic nucleus and the circa- \ndian timing system.
