D. EDDY*\nAbstract.During the first decade of the nineteenth century, Edinburgh was the scene of several\nlively debates concerning the structure of the Earth. Though the ideas of groups like the\n\u2018Wernerians\u2019 and the \u2018Huttonians\u2019 have received due attention, little has been done to expli-\ncate the practice of mineralogy as it existed in the decades before the debates. To dig deeper\ninto the eighteenth-century subject that formed the foundation of nineteenth-century geology\nin Scotland, this essay concentrates on Rev. Dr John Walker, the University of Edinburgh\u2019s\nProfessor of Natural History (1779\u20131803). In pursuing this topic, it builds on an earlier BJHS\narticle in which I excavated his early career as a mineralogist (1749\u201379). After first addressing\na few historiographical points and the provenance of the student manuscripts upon which this\nstudy is based, I explain the method that Walker used to arrange minerals. I then move on to\nshow that, like his younger attempts at mineralogical classification, his mature system was\nbased predominantly upon chemistry. This sets the stage for the last half of the essay where I\nreconstruct the mineralogical system that Walker taught to the hundreds of students who sat\nin his natural history lectures from 1782 until 1800. I then conclude with a few observations\nabout the relevance of his mineralogy to the scientific community of late eighteenth-century\nEdinburgh.\nSystems and manuscripts\nBy the time John Robison published his edition of Joseph Black\u2019s lecture notes in 1803,\nthe principle-based chemical nomenclature that his Edinburgh colleague had used\nduring the last half of the eighteenth century was already becoming obsolete. This\npredicament is clearly evinced in the numerous lists of equivalency tables that he in-\ncluded at the end of Black\u2019s discussion of salts. In a footnote to the last page of these\ntables, Robison avers, \u2018Unless the chemical reader makes this list familiar to his mind,\nhe must remain incapable of reading with intelligence the writings of all the chemists of\n* Dibner Institute, MIT E56-100, 38 Memorial Drive, Cambridge, MA, 02138, USA.\nI wish to dedicate this essay to Roy Porter. It was his initial comments on my doctoral thesis that led me to\nwrite it. During 2002 sections of this study were presented to the University of Oxford\u2019s Modern History\nFaculty and at Max Planck Institute for the History of Science (MPI). The final phases were written over the\nnext year when I was a postdoctoral fellow at MPI and the Dibner Institute, MIT. A very special thanks to the\nanonymous referees of the BJHS and to David M.

Oldroyd, Robert Fox, Rob\nIliffe, David Pantalony, Fred Page, NAHSTE (Navigational Aids for the History of Science, Technology and\nthe Environment in Scotland) and the staff of the following libraries: University of Durham, University of\nNewcastle, University of Edinburgh, Harvard University, the Dibner Institute (the Burndy Library) and the\nMax Planck Institute for the History of Science.

He [the\nreader] will remain equally ignorant of the writings of the most eminent natural historians and\nmineralogists, who employed no other language in all their discussions.\nClearly these comments contain a bit of rhetorical flair. Black had died in 1799 and\nRobison was trying to maintain the centrality of his friend\u2019s work in the face of the\nextraordinary success of the new nomenclature. However, from a historiographical\nperspective, Robison\u2019s assessment has turned out to be quite prophetic. Despite his\nprescient warning, most chemists soon became \u2018ignorant\u2019 of the old doctrines and, true\nto his prediction, a great many of the eighteenth century\u2019s chemically inclined natural\nphilosophers slowly slipped into oblivion.\nBearing Robison\u2019s comments in mind, it is the goal of this essay to read \u2018with intel-\nligence\u2019 the chemically based mineralogical \u2018system\u20192 that was taught in the University\nof Edinburgh\u2019s Medical School by Black\u2019s contemporary, Rev. Dr John Walker, the\nProfessor of Natural History from 1779 until 1803. This study follows on from a pre-\nvious article in which I outlined his early mineralogical system and his career as an\naspiring mineralogist (1749\u201379).3 More specifically, it reconstructs the system that he\ntaught to his students during his twenty-four years at the university. The place where his\nthoughts on this topic were most clearly evinced was his mineralogy lectures. Over the\npast two hundred years they have remained hidden away in a series of student note-\nbooks that are now housed in the University of Edinburgh\u2019s Special Collections\nDepartment. This essay is based on these manuscripts and I will address their form and\ncontent in more detail below. In addition to his lecture notes, I also use his personal\npapers and his library catalogue.4\nWalker was a popular lecturer who taught well over seven hundred students during\nhis tenure as professor.5 Included in this lot were natural philosophers like Sir James\nSmith, Thomas Beddoes, Robert Jameson, James Hall and John Playfair. In addition to\nthe names included on his class lists, there were those who sat in his public lectures and\n1 Joseph Black,On the Elements of Chemistry Delivered in the University of Edinburgh by the Late Joseph\nBlack, M.D. (ed. John Robison), Edinburgh, 1803, 499.\n2 In what follows, the word \u2018system\u2019 is employed as Walker and other professors in the Medical School\nused the term in their lectures; that is, a methodological arrangement of data.\n3 M.

In this article I traced Walker\u2019s chemical training,\nhis early attempts at mineralogical classification and the travels that he took in the Lowlands, Highlands and\nHebrides.\n4 A list of Walker\u2019s library was published by Cornelius Elliot as A Catalogue of the Books in Natural\nHistory with a Few Others, which Belonged to the Late Rev. Dr. Walker, Professor of Natural History in the\nUniversity of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, 1804. In subsequent footnotes, books that appear in this catalogue will\nbe followed by an \u2018EC\u2019 (Elliot\u2019s Catalogue) and then a number that connotes the book\u2019s placement on the\ncatalogue\u2019s list.\n5 The student lists of Walker\u2019s course can be found in M.

Eddy\nthe numerous naturalists with whom he corresponded.6 One of the advantages of ex-\nplicating Walker\u2019s work is that it provides a clearer picture of what was being taught to\nthese students and what was being discussed within the Medical School. More specifi-\ncally, his lectures offer a glimpse of the highly complex world of eighteenth-century\nnomenclature. Systematic arrangement, as understood by its Enlightened practitioners,\nis often drastically simplified or glossed over by historians. For the early eighteenth-\ncentury British scene, due attention has been given to Locke\u2019s and Linnaeus\u2019s \u2018kinds\u2019\nand \u2018species \u2019.7 Yet the apparent simplicity often assigned to Enlightenment nomencla-\nture, for both chemistry and natural history, has been subjected to much criticism\nduring the past three decades. For chemical nomenclature, it has been shown that there\nare many influential chemists to be found outside Lavoisier\u2019s historiographical sha-\ndow.8 For natural history, one of the most influential voices concerning the history of\nclassification has been Michel Foucault, but others such as John Dupre\u00b4 and Wolfgang\nLefe`vre have also addressed this issue.9 As I will show below, Edinburgh\u2019s Medical\nSchool favoured authors whose writings were relevant to practical and philosophical\nquestions being raised in Scotland.10 This meant that its mineralogical canon often\n6 A list of Walker\u2019s correspondents is housed in the reading room of the University of Edinburgh\u2019s Special\nCollections library.\n7 Attention is most often drawn to Locke\u2019s comments in Book III, Chapters I\u2013VII, of Essay Concerning\nHuman Understanding.

Also, just because eighteenth-century authors cited the empirical observations of a system-\natist did not mean that they agreed with his nomenclature. As J. L.

Bensaude-Vincent and F. Abbri (eds.), Lavoisier in\nEuropean context: Negotiating a New Language for Chemistry, Canton, 1995. Local, national and trans-\nnational understandings of science are also addressed in a recent, thought-provoking essay by Lewis Pyenson\nThe late mineralogical career of the \u2018 ingenious \u2019 Professor John Walker 375\nplaced just as much value (if not more) on works that were critical of writers like Locke\nor Linnaeus. For instance, even though John Thomson\u2019s biography of Edinburgh\u2019s\nProfessor William Cullen (1710\u201390) had kind words for \u2018Mr. Locke\u2019s excellent account\nof our complex ideas of substances \u2019, he qualified this assessment by stating that\nScotland\u2019s own Dugald Stewart (1753\u20131828) had made Locke\u2019s work much more\ncomprehensible during the late eighteenth century.11\nThe central role played by chemistry within Edinburgh\u2019s medical community en-\ngendered a wide variety of data, especially in relation to minerals. Faced with bottle\nafter bottle of mineral water, and box after box of stones and materia medica simples,\nmost physicians and naturalists organized their collections around the chemical prin-\nciples of Earth, Salt and Metal that were promoted both in the Medical School and in\nthe foreign publications that they read. The systems created by these chemists were by\nno means in agreement and were often influenced by the perceived use of the system.12\nThe result was a string of competing mineralogical classifications. However, even\nthough the medical professors in Edinburgh disagreed over the nuances of nomencla-\nture divisions, they were united in their belief that mineralogy should be founded on\nchemical characters. Such a view of minerals was also held by most practising chemists\nin Scotland and by members of the aristocracy.13 This was notably different from the\nmineral system offered by Linnaeus in his Systema Natur\u00e6. It is also different from the\nsystems offered by the English mineralogy texts written by Emanuel Mendes Da Costa\nand John Hill.14\nWalker\u2019s system was recorded in many forms during the course of his tenure at the\nUniversity of Edinburgh. There are thirteen known bound manuscript volumes of stu-\ndent notes taken in his mineralogy lectures. This essay is based on these sources. Unlike\nhis geology lectures, those on mineralogy were never published.15 Most of them are\nthat investigates broad-ranging historiographical issues relevant to the scientific enterprise in Europe, South\nAmerica, the Middle East and Asia.

Eddy\nhoused in the Special Collections Department of the University of Edinburgh Library.16\nEven though he published the heads of his lectures,17 these only consisted of the actual\nnames that he gave to his classes, orders, genera and species. This means that the\nempirical data that he used to form his classification categories can only be found in the\nnotes taken by his students. Their notebooks show that even though he tried hard to\ndifferentiate minerals based on composition, it seems that some of the classification\ncategories were not mutually exclusive (especially in the case of minerals with prob-\nlematic compositions). However, this being said, many of the mineralogies in his library\ncontained categories that occasionally vied for the same mineral.18 Additionally, when\nreading these notes, it becomes quite clear that the printed texts cited by Walker do not\nfall within the standard canon of natural history and chemistry books usually men-\ntioned in modern secondary sources concerned with investigating the \u2018origins\u2019 of\nchemical or Darwinian \u2018revolutions\u2019.19 Rather than being interested in theorists like\nBuffon and Hutton,20 Walker and his Medical School colleagues paid more attention to\nHowever, these only offer a tiny glimpse of Walker\u2019s system because they are undated and were only the\npreamble to the forty to fifty curricular and extracurricular lectures that Walker gave on the topic over the\ncourse of the year.\n16 Eleven are housed at the University of Edinburgh, one at the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh and\none at the University of Aberdeen.\n17 John Walker, Institutes of Natural History; Containing the Heads of Lectures in Natural History;\nDelivered by Dr. John Walker, in the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, 1792; idem, Classes Fossilium:\nSive, Characteres Naturales et Chymici Classium et Ordinum in Systemate Minerali: cum Nominibus\nGenericis Adscriptis, Edinburgi, 1787.

This could be the copy used by\nWalker\u2019s student Thomas Beddoes when he was lecturing there in early 1790s. LikeWalker, Beddoes collected\nminerals (with Davies Gilbert) and then used them as illustrations in his lectures. See the \u2018Introduction\u2019 in R.\nSiegfried and R. H.

Porter, Doctor of Society: Thomas Beddoes and the Sick Trade in Late\nEnlightenment England, London, 1992, 13.\n18 This was a problem for most mineralogists in the eighteenth century. See David R. Oldroyd, Thinking\nabout the Earth: A History of Ideas in Geology, London, 1996, 97\u2013100.\n19 Often the anachronistic categories of early nineteenth-century conceptions like \u2018Vulcanism\u2019 and\n\u2018Neptunianism\u2019 are used to characterize mineralogical and geological works written from 1700 to 1800.\nNotable exceptions to this method are R. Porter, TheMaking of Geology, Cambridge, 1977; R. Laudan, From\nMineralogy to Geology: The Foundations of a Science, 1650\u20131830, London, 1987; N. E.

Fritscher, Vulkanismusstreit und Geochemie: Die\nBedeutung der Chemie und des Experiments in der Vulkanismus-Neptunismus-Kontroverse, Stuttgart, 1991.\n20 Over twenty years ago R. Porter\u2019s The Making of Geology, op. cit. (19), pointed out that Hutton was\nnot the centre of Scotland\u2019s emerging discipline of \u2018geology\u2019. In his recent (and brief) essay on this book,\nMartin Rudwick re-emphasizes Porter\u2019s claim that \u2018Hutton was exceptional and even anomalous\u2019 for the\nScottish context. \u2018Roy Porter, historian of geology\u2019, History of Science (2003), 41, 251\u20136. Additionally, the\nspeculative aspects of Buffon\u2019s natural history (especially his cosmogonical account) did not resonate with\nthe empirical epistemology of Edinburgh\u2019s philosophers and physicians \u2013 a point that figured into Walker\u2019s\nbid for the chair of natural history (against William Smellie) and subsequently in his lectures on geology. See\nThe late mineralogical career of the \u2018 ingenious \u2019 Professor John Walker 377\na different group of European authors \u2013 especially chemists whose works were obtain-\nable via North Sea trade routes.21\nBearing these issues in mind, this essay explains how Walker arranged his mineral-\nogical system. For the most part I will use the twelve-volume set of stenographed notes\ntaken by (Sir) David Pollock in Walker\u2019s 1797 lecture series.22 Of the many bound\ncollections of notes taken by Walker\u2019s students, these are by far the most detailed. Yet\nPollockwas silent on a few issues and in these cases I refer to other sets of notes (this does\nnot occur very often and I include an explicatory footnote when it does). On the whole,\nthe notes of Pollock and other students show that Walker orally explained the lead\ncharacters that he used to form his classes, orders, genera and species. Even so, Walker\u2019s\ndefinitions of these characters are sometimes confusing, incomplete or illegible. These\nconsiderations in combination with the tedious nature of the chemistry behindWalker\u2019s\nmineralogy make reconstructing his system an exciting, but challenging, task.\nEven though he sometimes changed their sequential number, Walker kept the same\nclass names throughout his time as a professor.23 A comparison of his personal notes,\nstudent notebooks and the books in his library and his museum indicates that his\nsystem went through at least three stages. He created his first comprehensive system\nin 1781 \u2013 the year before he gave his first full natural history course. This was\ncalled Schediasma Fossilium and it consisted of eighteen classes.24 The second version\nof his system appeared around 1790 and the number of the classes went up to\nnineteen. This change was most clearly captured in manuscript copies of his\nstudents\u2019 notebooks.25 Although he began to lose his eyesight in the mid-1790s, the final\nversion occurred around 1795 when he decided to create a catalogue for the mineralogy\ncollection that was under his supervision in the University of Edinburgh\u2019s Natural\nC.

Pollock was a\nstudent at Edinburgh in 1797, but he did not graduate.\n23 But there were some changes. He had originally included Fusoria (Class 5) in his 1781 system. But by\n1790 he had replaced it with Ponderosa and Amandina.\n24 John Walker, Schediasma Fossilium, Edinburgh, 1781, housed in Edinburgh University Library, Special\nCollections Department (hereafter EUL), DC.2.19, and another copy with notations, EUL DC.8.20. This\neighteen-class system is reprinted in Walker, op. cit. (15), 230\u20137. In 1786 he began to amend Schediasma by\nmoving around its orders and by listing more characters for each fossil. These corrections were not that\nsubstantial and in 1787 he published these augmentations of Schediasma as Classes Fossilium, Edinburgh,\n1787.

Although the general definitions of these methods\nremained the same throughout his mineralogy, botany and zoology lectures, he only\nintended this lecture to be a general summary of the main methods available to a\nnaturalist. One must therefore read his lectures on botany, zoology and mineralogy as\nindividual units to see how he adapted his methods to the data available for each\nkingdom. In what follows below, I take care to explicate his method of classification\nsolely in relation to how it is represented in his mineralogy lectures. Those who wish\nto pursue his botanical and zoological methods will need to consult his personal\nmanuscripts and the botany and zoology lecture notes taken by his students during the\n1780s and 1790s.29\nUsing the chemistry that he had learned in Edinburgh, Walker modelled his miner-\nalogical system on Torbern Olaf Bergman\u2019s Outlines of Mineralogy (1783),30 Johan\nGottschalk Wallerius\u2019s Mine\u00b4ralogie (1753),31 and Axel Fredrik Cronstedt\u2019s Essay\n26 C.

His botanical classification was based closely on Linnaeus\u2019s Systema\nNaturae. G. Taylor, \u2018John Walker, D.D., F.R.S.E. 1731\u20131803. Notable Scottish naturalist \u2019, Transactions of\nthe Botanical Society of Edinburgh (1959), 38, 180\u2013203. Botany at this time in Edinburgh was also closely tied\nto georgics. During the 1790s Walker made an unsuccessful bid to become the Professor of Agriculture.\nC. W. J. Withers treats this in \u2018A neglected Scottish agriculturalist : the \u2018\u2018georgical lectures\u2019\u2019 and agricultural\nwritings of the Rev. Dr. John Walker (1731\u20131803)\u2019, Agricultural History Review (1985), 33, 132\u201343. For\nzoology,Walker advocated the use of classification characters taken from internal organs, not just those based\nupon external morphology. This approach is most clearly evinced in the following manuscript lectures taken\nby his students: Lectures on Natural History (1790), bound MSS, EUL DC.2.27 and DC.2.27 and Epitome of\nNatural History (1797), bound MS, EUL Gen 711.D and 712.D.\n30 T.

In addition to these texts, he possessed numerous copies of their other\nworks in his personal library.33 Even though the chemical mineralogy presented by these\nthree authors had a profound influence over Walker and other eighteenth-century min-\neralogists, the impact of this \u2018Swedish school\u2019 has remained relatively unexplored in\nanglophone histories of chemistry and\/or the nascent earth sciences.34 Instead, attention\nhas been given to the writings of Abraham Gottlob Werner (1750\u20131817), a mineralogist\nfrom Saxony whose work had its most profound impact upon early nineteenth-century\nEuropean geology. In particular, his internal and external characters35 are usually dis-\ncussed in reference to Linnaean classification. However, even these characters were\nclosely tied to Werner\u2019s knowledge of chemistry and a close look at his writings reveals\nthat he too was significantly influenced by ideas presented by both Wallerius and\nCronstedt. Werner even employed the same terms and nomenclature divisions used by\nthese two authors, though he did choose to recalibrate their ideas in relation to the data\nat his disposal in Saxony. As we will see, Walker did the same thing in Scotland. Thus,\nsince Werner and Walker lived within different chemical communities and were of two\ndifferent generations (Walker was twenty years older than Werner), they often drew\nfrom the same authors but produced a different type of system.36 Furthermore, though\n32 A.

(3). However, there were local factors that influenced how a given community used chemical\ncharacters to create classification systems. The nuances of differing national or even linguistic interpretations\nin chemistry within Scotland and Scandinavia are perhaps best evinced by how each country received the new\nnomenclature during the 1780s and 1790s. For Sweden, see A. Lundgren, \u2018The new nomenclature in Sweden:\nthe debate that wasn\u2019t \u2019, Osiris (1988), 4, 146\u201368. For Scotland, see A.

A. V.\nCarozzi), Urbana, 1962. This was originally published as Von den a\u00a8usserlichen Kennzeichen der Fossilien,\nLeipzig, 1774.\n36 Additionally, even had Walker been fluent in German, much of Werner\u2019s work was published after\nWalker had created his mineralogical system. English translations or explications of Werner\u2019s work appeared\nafter he died. The first of these were J. Mawe (ed.), A New Catalogue of Mineral Substances. The\nArrangement and Classification after Professor Werner\u2019s system, to which Is Added the New Names from\n380 M. D. Eddy\nWalker was familiar with a number of Latin and French works written by German\nauthors, I have found no mention of Werner in any of his lectures or personal notes.37\nLike most mineralogical systems of the time, Walker\u2019s system was based on\n\u2018characters \u2019 ; that is, empirical data taken from a mineral that was held to be rep-\nresentative of its structure, form or composition. In general, he held that there were two\ntypes of mineralogical character : natural and chemical.38 Unlike most contemporary\nbotanical arrangements (including his own), Walker did not use essential characters for\nhis mineralogical system.39 For him, a natural character was a \u2018part \u2019 of a mineral that\ncould be observed plainly on its external surface or by breaking it open. Characters of\nthis type included colour, texture, fracture and shape. As so defined, his conception of a\n\u2018natural \u2019 character bore a striking similarity to Bergman\u2019s definition of an \u2018external \u2019\ncharacter : \u2018 the chief superficial marks of any fossil taken together, constitute the ex-\nternal character \u2019.40 Indeed, student lecture notes indicate that Walker used the word\n\u2018external \u2019 and \u2018natural \u2019 interchangeably.41 Because natural characters sought to rep-\nresent a mineral exactly as it existed undisturbed in nature, Walker held that the way in\nwhich a mineralogist arranged these characters was by a natural method.\nA second type of character was a chemical character, and this was taken directly from\nprinciple-based chemistry. Walker\u2019s conception of a chemical character also mirrored\nBergman\u2019s definition of an internal character : \u2018A collection of those properties on\nwhich the leading [chemical] principles depend, is called internal character. \u201942 This\nProfessor Hau\u00a8y, London, 1804, and Charles Anderson (tr.), New Theory of the Formation of Veins; with its\nApplication to the Art of Working Mines, Edinburgh, 1809. After these works appeared, several of Werner\u2019s\nworks were translated into English.\n37 Edinburgh\u2019s preference for authors like Wallerius, Cronstedt and Bergman led many of Walker\u2019s stu-\ndents to become interested in Werner\u2019s work. For example, two who were particularly fond of Walker\u2019s\ncourse, Robert Jameson and Charles Anderson, went on to translate Werner\u2019s works into English and to\nfound the Wernerian Society of Edinburgh in the years after Walker died. Additionally, Thomas Beddoes,\nanother one of Walker\u2019s students who endeavoured to learn German, had begun to read Werner\u2019s work in the\nBergma\u00a8nnisches Journal during the 1790s. However, Beddoes seems to have disagreed with Werner\u2019s geo-\nlogical conclusions. See \u2018Observations on the affinity between basaltes and granite. By Thomas Beddoes,\nM. D.; Communicated by Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. P. R. S.\u2019, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of\nLondon (1791), 81, 48\u201370. Furthermore, Walker was quite keen to keep external and internal mineralogical\ncharacters separated.

S. \u2019 Philosophical\nTransactions (1798), 88, 403\u201348.\n38 These distinctions have been around for quite a while \u2013 especially in mineralogy and early attempts at\nchemical analysis. See R. Hookyaas, \u2018The discrimination between \u2018\u2018natural\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018artificial\u2019\u2019 substances and\nthe development of corpuscular theory\u2019, Archives internationales d\u2019histoire des sciences (1948), 4, 640\u201351.\n39 The failure to recognize the difference between botanical and mineralogical characters has caused much\nconfusion in histories of eighteenth-century chemico-mineralogical systematics.

Walker had a copy of this book in his\nlibrary and cited it in his lectures.\n41 For instance, see [Anon.], Notes of Walker\u2019s Lectures on Natural History (c. 1790), bound MS, EUL\nDC.10.33, f. 330.\n42 Bergman, op. cit. (40), 226. Original emphasis.\nThe late mineralogical career of the \u2018 ingenious \u2019 Professor John Walker 381\nsimilarity explains why Walker used \u2018chemical \u2019 and \u2018 internal \u2019 as synonyms in his lec-\ntures.43 Walker held that the process by which a mineralogist arranged chemical\ncharacters was called a chemical method.44 This was his method of choice. He only\nreverted to natural characters when he ran out of chemical characters, a practice that he\ncalled the mixed method.45 But on the whole, just about all of the classes, orders, genera\nand species in his system were based on chemical characters. These were obtained via\nthe application of heat, water, acids or alkalis. He was able to employ chemistry in such\na manner because he had learned it in the University of Edinburgh\u2019s Medical School\nunder the instruction of William Cullen during the 1750s46 and he had used it to create a\nrudimentary mineralogical schema during the 1760s.47\nDuring the eighteenth century chemical characters in Edinburgh were generated by\nprinciple-based chemistry. This form of chemistry used the word \u2018principle\u2019 to rep-\nresent the most basic forms of matter which could be empirically verified in the lab-\noratory. The principles used by Walker and other contemporary chemists were Salt,\nEarth, Fire (Inflammables), Metal, Water and (sometimes) Air.48 When classifying\nminerals, most early modern chemists (Joseph Black and Bergman included) converted\nfour of these principles directly into mineralogical classes. According to Bergman,\nAvicenna, an Arabian physician of the eleventh century, divided fossils into the four classes of\nsalts, earths, metals and phlogistic [inflammable] bodies. In this division, all substances\nagreeing whether in external or internal character, are properly enough combined; and, as\nhitherto no general arrangement has been proposed preferable to this, it is in no doubt of being\ncontinued.49\nSince the base of Walker\u2019s mineralogical arrangement was chemistry, this meant that it\ndiffered fundamentally from the arrangement popularized by Linnaeus\u2019s Systema\nNatur\u00e6. This was because Linnaeus\u2019s mineralogy was based almost entirely on external\ncharacters (like colour and shape).50 However, since Walker disagreed with the priority\nthat Linnaeus gave to non-chemical (external) characters, he utilized chemical charac-\nters to create a form of binary nomenclature similar to that employed by Bergman and\nhis predecessors (Wallerius and Cronstedt in particular). He used this as a base for a\n43 Lectures on Natural History, op. cit. (41), f. 330.\n44 This method was a slightly reconfigured form of the \u2018artificial method\u2019 discussed by Walker in\n\u2018Imperium natur\u00e6\u2019, in Walker, op. cit. (15), 222.\n45 Thereby following the general definition of this method in his \u2018 Imperium Natur\u00e6\u2019 lecture, in Walker,\nop. cit (15), 222.\n46 M. D.

But he usually used this only after he had run out of natural characters. However, during his early\ncareer, he had displayed a keen interest in the chemistry of minerals. This can be seen in a manuscript that he\nwrote in Fahlun during 1734. It was finally printed as Vulcanus Docimasticus, Uppsala, 1925.\n382 M. D.

Throughout his first decade of lecturing, he asserted that he did not create new\nmineralogical classes, orders or genera per se : \u2018As to the names of the Classes, Orders,\nand especially those of the Genera, there are none of them new and none of them\nmine. \u201952 As Lefe`vre has recently shown, such a preservation of the topmost categories\nwas commonplace in Enlightenment classification systems.53 This being said, the ap-\nparent simplicity of his comment above on the quintuple division is hard to substantiate\nbecause neither Walker\u2019s personal papers nor the notes taken by students in his min-\neralogy course give the specific criteria that he used to create many of his classes, orders\nand genera. Additionally, as will be shown below, Walker\u2019s later systems expanded his\nclasses beyond the four chemical principles employed by Black, Bergman and other\nchemists.\nPrimary and secondary characters\nIn basing his mineralogical system on chemistry, Walker followed in the footsteps of\nWallerius, Cronstedt and Bergman. In particular, he followed Bergman\u2019s dictum that,\n\u2018 In methodizing fossils, compounds should rank under the most abundant ingredient. \u201954\nIn this case, \u2018abundance\u2019 was determined by weight. As Albury and Oldroyd explain it,\n\u2018 If, for example, substance \u2018\u2018xy\u2019\u2019 contained more \u2018\u2018x\u2019\u2019 than \u2018\u2018y\u2019\u2019, then it should belong\nto the genus \u2018\u2018x\u2019\u2019. \u201955 The unit of measurement was the \u2018grain\u2019 and composition was\nlisted in parts per hundred. This was commonly practised in both chemistry and min-\neralogy texts of the time.56 When chemical characters were not enough, Walker reverted\nto natural characters. His commitment to chemical classification did not change\nthroughout his teaching career and he summed up this belief about five years before he\ndied. In 1797 he reaffirmed that chemistry should be used to form \u2018the leading\nCharacter of the Classes and Orders. \u2026 AMethod, & properly executed, equally useful\n51 David Pollock (transcriber), An Epitome of Natural History (1797), bound MS, EUL Gen. 706D, f. 6.\n52 Walker, op. cit.

The debate concerning Bergman\u2019s\nuse of \u2018equivalent\u2019 weights during the 1970s illustrates the linguistic and conceptual difficulties presented to\nmodern scholars when trying to understand eighteenth-century scientific measurement.

Using this approach, the general structure of Walker\u2019s\nsystem remained relatively unchanged. Although he made minor adjustments\nthroughout his career, on the whole, his changes mainly concerned genera and species,\nand not classes and orders.\nWalker followed the eighteenth-century tradition of subdividing chemical \u2018principles \u2019\ninto \u2018Primary\u2019 and \u2018Secondary\u2019 categories.58 Following Bergman, he held that there\nwere five Primary Earths.59 He also believed that there were two Primary Salts and six\nPrimary Metals :\nPrimary Earths Primary Salts Primary Metals\nCalcareous Acids Iron\nArgillaceous Alkalis Tin\nMagnesia Copper\nTerra Ponderosa Silver\nSiliceous Lead\nGold\nMost of Walker\u2019s mineralogy lectures included instructions on how to use acids and\nheat to ascertain the composition of a mineral and there are sections where it appears\nthat he was combining his own experimental knowledge with that of colleagues like\nCullen, Black and Thomas Charles Hope. This being said, it is unclear how much his\nacceptance of \u2018Primary\u2019 categories was dependent upon experiments that he performed\non his own. During this time, just about every naturalist had to use data that had been\nrecorded (usually in print) by someone else. InWalker\u2019s case, the process of determining\nthe relevance of such textual evidence was most probably influenced by his education\nunder Cullen and the chemical community of late eighteenth-century Edinburgh \u2013\nespecially the experimental chemistry being conducted in the Medical School from\nthe 1770s until the 1790s. Student notebooks show that he cited a significant amount\nof data taken from the writings of Wallerius, Bergman, William Watson, Wilhelm\n57 Walker, op. cit. (27), f. 22\u20134. He made similar statements throughout his lecturing career. For instance,\ncompare the above statement to the following: \u2018 the characters of the Classes & Orders must be formed on\nChemical principles. While those of the Genera, Species and Varieties seem to depend chiefly upon their\nnatural marks.\u2019Lectures of Natural History, op. cit. (41), f. 330. See alsoAn Epitome, op. cit. (51), 706D, f. 35.\n58 Bergman argued that these principles were not \u2018metaphysical \u2019 because they demonstrated observable\nempirical properties. Beretta touches upon this point when discussing Bergman\u2019s chemia sublimior. See\nBeretta, op. cit. (8), 134\u201349. These \u2018properties \u2019 were also closely linked to Bergman\u2019s conception of chemical\naffinity. See A. M. Duncan, Laws and Order in Eighteenth-Century Chemistry, Oxford, 1996, 136\u201345 and\n148\u201353.\n59 Since the early part of the century there had been many debates as to the exact number of Primary\nEarths. Although Johann Gottschalk Wallerius and Axel Frederick Cronstedt had influenced Walker\u2019s early\nmineralogical education on this topic, the 1780s saw him accept the five Primary Earths of Swedish\nchemist Torbern Bergman: calcareous, argillaceous, magnesia, terra ponderosa and siliceous. Bergman,\nop. cit. (30), \u00b785.\n384 M. D. Eddy\nScheele, Richard Kirwan and Joseph Priestley \u2013 all authors who were frequently con-\nsulted in the Medical School. Furthermore, his affinity for Bergman was no doubt\nlinked to the fact that Bergman\u2019s chemistry harmonized with the work of Cullen and\nBlack.60\nUsing the characters generated by chemistry to arrange minerals was not without its\ndifficulties, and Walker repeatedly stated this in his lectures. One of the biggest prob-\nlems was that laboratory techniques and non-standardized solvents and reagents\n(usually acids and alkalis) made it very difficult consistently to determine the exact\npercentage of the chemical substances that formed a given mineral\u2019s composition. A\nfurther complication was that Primary Earths were sometimes so strongly bound to\neach other that they could not be split apart into primary classification characters. For\nthose stones consisting of two or more Primary Earths \u2018 intimately united\u2019, Walker\nfollowed the Bergmanian practice of creating a sub-chemical category of \u2018derivative \u2019\nEarths. Bergman held that the force that bound them together was a highly localized,\nnon-mechanical expression of chemical affinity, or, in his words, Derivative Earths\nhad \u2018a mutual attraction to each other, and form combinations more intimate than\nmechanical ones\u2019.61 Walker accepted this definition and considered several chemical\nsubstances to be Derivative or, as he sometimes stated, Secondary:\nSecondary Earths Secondary Salts Secondary Metals\nSteatite Neutral Pyrites\nAmiandina Acid-Earth Semimetals\nSchista Alkali-Earth\nGypsum Vitriol\nPhosphorus\nApyrite\nMica\nAs will be shown in more detail in the sections below, all of the classes of his system\nwere not based solely on one empirical \u2018character \u2019 associated with an overarching\nchemical principle. If this were the case, there would only be four classes : Earths, Salts,\nMetals and Inflammables (water was not generally considered to be a mineral). In\nreality, Walker was using six different types of \u2018 lead\u2019 chemical character to form his\nclasses.62 The first was a principle itself and this is why he named Class 15 \u2018Salts \u2019, Class\n16 \u2018Inflammables\u2019 and Class 19 \u2018Metals \u2019.63 The second was a primary representation of\nthe principle, hence Class 2 (Calcareous), Class 4 (Ponderous), Class 7 (Siliceous). Next\nthere were characters based on the secondary representations of the principle: Class 3\n60 Duncan has argued that there was a \u2018strong probability\u2019 that Bergman was influenced by Cullen and\nBlack. See Duncan, op. cit. (58), 127\u20139 and 146\u20137.\n61 Bergman, op. cit. (30), \u00b783; idem, op. cit. (40), 244.\n62 I use the word \u2018lead\u2019 here based on Walker\u2019s use of a \u2018 leading\u2019 character in his lectures. Walker, op. cit.\n(27), ff. 22\u20134.\n63 There is a full chart of Walker\u2019s system as it existed in 1797 at the end of this essay.\nThe late mineralogical career of the \u2018 ingenious \u2019 Professor John Walker 385\n(Gypseous), Class 5 (Phosphoric), Class 8 (Steatitical), Class 10 (Zeolitical), Class 11\n(Micaceous), Class 17 (Mundicks) and Class 18 (Semimetals). A fourth lead character\nwas a mineral\u2019s inability to burn and this produced only one category, Class 9\n(Apyrites), and a fifth was the presence of iron \u2013 Class 6 (Amandina). For classes 12 to\n14, Walker took a different tack in selecting the lead character. These rocks were gen-\nerally much larger than the minerals mentioned above. In fact, they were quite massive\nand seemed to be part of what Walker called the Earth\u2019s \u2018primary strata\u2019. For these\nrocks, the lead character was the type of cement (a chemical formation) that held them\ntogether: Class 12 (Petr\u00e6), Class 13 (Saxa) and Class 14 (Concreta). Overall, in basing\nall of his classes on chemistry, this method was technically \u2018mixed\u2019 because it alternated\nbetween different types of chemical character.\nThough Walker\u2019s system was quite comprehensive, his lectures did not clearly ex-\nplain how he selected the lead chemical character of each class. From a chemical\nstandpoint, using principles and their primary and secondary manifestations was well\ngrounded on the work of Bergman and others. For instance, in his Outlines, Bergman\nlisted the five \u2018Primitive Earths\u2019 and then noted, \u2018And we must believe these to be\nprimitive, until it shall appear by proper experiments that they may be separated into\nothers, still more simple, or changed into one another by art. \u201964 Similar statements\nabout Primary and Secondary manifestations of Salts, Earths, Inflammables and Metals\ncan be found in the work of Cullen, Black and other chemists being read in the Medical\nSchool (Bergman, Wallerius and Cronstedt in particular). So even though Walker\u2019s\nelevation of lower nomenclatural categories to classes was somewhat innovative, it was\nfirmly grounded on chemical practice.\nStones, earths and strata\nIn this section and those that follow, I will use Walker\u2019s mineralogical appellations\nto refer to the stones classified in his system.65 The lecture notes taken by Walker\u2019s\nstudents in his mineralogy lectures clearly show that Classes 2 to 11 were generally\nfound in secondary strata.66 Their lead chemical character was either a Primary or a\n64 Bergman, op. cit. (30), \u00b786.\n65 Identifying how his Stones\u2019 names compare to those used in modern mineralogy exceeds the focus of this\nessay. Two good sources for such a comparison are M. F. Heddle, The Mineralogy of Scotland Vols. I\u2013II, St\nAndrews, 1924, and A. M. Clark, Hey\u2019s Mineral Index: Mineral Species, Varieties and Synonyms, London,\n1993. Heddle\u2019s work will have additional interest to those interested in the local Gaelic names associated with\nseveral Scottish minerals.\n66 Class 1 consisted of different types of soil. Since this arrangement of soils was basically a smaller version\nof other chemical categories used elsewhere in Walker\u2019s system, I will set this class aside and not discuss it. He\nheld that \u2018earths\u2019 (Class 1: Terra) \u2013 that is, soils \u2013 could not be satisfactorily classified. This being the case, he\ndoes attempt to arrange their orders based on chemical characters. For instance, he propounds that this is \u2018the\nClass which can have no Place in a Chymical Method; but it is necessary to retain the Earths in a separate\nClass for the Purposes of Natural History\u2019. An Epitome of Natural History, op. cit. 51, 706D, f. 41. In this\ncase, the \u2018Purposes of Natural History\u2019 was no doubt georgics. This suggests that it is quite likely that aspiring\nfarmers audited the first part of his lectures without staying on for the rest of the course. Such a scenario\nexplains why there are three different sets of lecture notes (in different handwriting) on Class 1 alone in\nLectures on Natural History, op. cit. (41), ff. 332\u2013292.\n386 M. D. Eddy\nSecondary Earth:\nClass 2: Calcareous Class 7: Siliceous\nClass 3: Gypseous Class 8: Steatitical\nClass 4: Ponderous Class 9: Apyrous\nClass 5: Phosphoric Class 10: Zeolitical\nClass 6: Amandina Class 11: Micaceous\nThe exact quantity of each stone\u2019s \u2018Earthy\u2019 component was not always recorded in the\nclass notes of Walker\u2019s students. Usually composition was listed in order of abundance.\nThe character that had the highest weight was listed first and the rest were listed in\ndescending order (this was often done without any numbers being given to explain the\nexact percentage of each Earth).\nWhen Walker gave his lectures, he took care to point out the industrial and phar-\nmacological uses of these stones. To this goal, he gave his students instructions on\nwhere to find minerals in the Highlands and Lowlands. Since Scotland\u2019s physicians\napplied their mineralogical knowledge not only to medicine (especially materia medica)\nbut also to industry and agriculture, it is no coincidence that most of Walker\u2019s classes\nwere of relevance to these subjects.67 I shall therefore address each class in relation to its\nchemical composition and its role(s) in commodification. The main component of a\nCalcareous Stone (Class 2) was (Primary) Calcareous Earth.68 This type of stone was of\ncrucial importance to the Medical School\u2019s interest in lime-water, a solution formed\nfrom limestone which was used to dislodge or dissolve bladder stones (also called cal-\nculi).69 This ailment (along with gout and venereal disease) ran rampant among the\naristocracy and gentry and was therefore the bread and butter of future physicians and\nsurgeons who sat in Walker\u2019s lectures.70 Gypseous Stone\u2019s (Class 3) lead character was\ngypsum, a Secondary Earth formed from Calcareous Earth that had been combined\nwith vitriolic acid.71 As the 1771 edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (an Edinburgh\npublication) succinctly stated, \u2018The gypsums are much used in plaster, for stuccoing\n67 An informative work on the chemical foundations of industry and agriculture in Enlightenment\nScotland is A. Clow and N. L. Clow\u2019s The Chemical Revolution: A Contribution to Social Technology,\nLondon, 1952. Walker\u2019s chemical contributions are mentioned throughout the book. See also Withers,\nop. cit. (29).\n68 This was qualified by the fact that they could be \u2018converted into quicklime by Fire\u2019. An Epitome of\nNatural History, op. cit. (51), 706D, f. 160. Earlier in the 1790s, Walker had hinted that presence of Aerial\nAcid was also a characteristic of these stones, going as far as to assert, \u2018Of all the Calcareous Earths, chalk\ncontains the largest proportion of Aerial Acid. Mr. Kirwan found no less than 40 per cent in it. \u2019 Lectures on\nNatural History, op. cit. (41), f. 343. Because Walker does not give specific composition here, it is hard to tell\nwhat percentage of Calcareous Earth or Aerial Acid is needed to determine his conception of a Calcareous\nStone. In general there was no consensus on this point at this time. It is for this reason that Walker cites\ndifferent Calcareous Stone chemical compositions from various mineralogies for every order.\n69 M. D.

As Golinski has shown, this\nsort of stone had been a \u2018noble spectacle \u2019 in Britain since the seventeenth century; that\nis, phosphorous was a useful conversational piece for chemists (who were often phys-\nicians) seeking to impress patrons or other natural philosophers.74 As an avid reader of\nthe Philosophical Transactions, Walker was no doubt aware of this tradition and em-\nphasized that, when heated without a flame, these stones gave off a \u2018beautiful\nPhosphoric Light \u2019.75 Walker\u2019s comments on zeolite, a Secondary Earth and the lead\ncharacter for Zeolitical Stone (Class 10), were more complicated. Without naming page\nnumbers (which commonly occurs), Pollock\u2019s notes cite the work of three authors on\nthis topic : Torbern Bergman,76 Johann Anton Scopoli and Jean-Baptiste-Michel\nBucquet.77 Each of these authors held a different position on zeolite\u2019s chemical com-\nposition.78 Since Walker had been contemplating the composition of zeolite since the\n1760s,79 in the end he seems to have rejected Bergman, Scopoli and Bucquet and con-\ncluded that zeolite was formed from Calcareous Earth and Siliceous Earth.\nFurthermore, his long-standing interest in zeolite suggests that he made it a class in his\nsystem because of his familiarity with its composition and because of its popularity with\nEdinburgh\u2019s chemists. Similarly, Walker probably included Ponderous Stones (Class 4)\non account of their relevance to scientific discourse. Their lead character was the\n(Primary) Ponderous Earth that had been proposed by Bergman in 1774.80 This Primary\n72 Encyclopaedia Britannica (ed. William Smellie), Edinburgh, 1771, ii, 767.\n73 An Epitome of Natural History, op. cit. (51), 707D, ff. 29 and 85. However, it seems that Walker could\nnot determine whether the other component was sulphur (Wallerius) or \u2018Acidum opatosum\u2019 (Scheele). See the\nfirst volume (\u00b7\u00b7172 and 176) of Wallerius\u2019s Systema Mineralogicum, op. cit. (33), and the first volume (\u00b723) of\nCronstedt\u2019s System of Mineralogy, op. cit. (32).

(32) \u2013 Bergman was no doubt referencing one of the Swedish\neditions.\n77 G. A. Scopoli, Principia Mineralogi\u00e6 Systematic\u00e6 et Practic\u00e6, Vetro-Prag\u00e6, 1772, EC 209.

Even though Walker mentions Bergman, Scopoli and Bucquet in his\nmain lecture section on zeolitical stones, he does not cite them in the bibliographical (further reading) section\nlisted at the end of Pollock\u2019s notes. The main authors cited for Zeolitical Earths in that section are, once again,\nWallerius and Cronstedt. See An Epitome of Natural History, op. cit.

Eddy, op. cit. (3), 425.\n80 According to Walker, \u2018The Fossils of this Class, are chiefly composed of the Terra Ponderosa, or\nBarytes\u2019. Bergman, op. cit. (30), addresses Ponderous Earth in \u00b7\u00b787\u201391.\n388 M. D. Eddy\nEarth had generated a good deal of controversy and debate and its inclusion inWalker\u2019s\nsystem confirmed his dedication to Bergman\u2019s writings.\nClass 6 contained Amandina Stones, and it seems that the lead classification character\nwas iron (garnets are part of this class). However, some of the chemical compositions\nlisted for each Amandina genus demonstrate that the ferrous component was quite low.\nWalker probably thought that iron produced the reddish colour of the rocks and so he\ntherefore included them in this class. The name of Siliceous Stones (Class 7) came from\n(Primary) Siliceous Earth, which was basically sand.81 The most obvious point of in-\nterest for this class is that it included gems and diamonds.82 Aside from sand\u2019s use for\nmaking glass,83 Siliceous Stones were valued by several industrial practices in Scotland.\nSandy gravel, for instance, was used to make artificial phosphorus and was one of the\nkey ingredients in cement. Related to Siliceous Stones were Apyrous Stones (Class 9).\nPollock\u2019s notes on this class contain a table that demonstrates that they contained a\nhigh percentage of Siliceous Earth.84 Steatitical Earth, which was a Secondary Earth\nformed from Magnesian Earth and Siliceous Earth (both Primary Earths), was the lead\ncharacter for Steatitical Stones (Class 8). During his early travels across Scotland,\nWalker was continually on the lookout for forms of steatite which could be used to\nmake porcelain (this stone also was known to exist in Devonshire and Cornwall). As the\nEncyclopaedia Britannica pointed out, steatite \u2018afforded the finest earthen-ware ever\nmade \u2026 and promises fair, with good management, for equalling any in the world\u2019.85\nSteatitical Stones were therefore important for those in Walker\u2019s course who were in-\nterested in this industry.86 The same held for Micaceous Stones (Class 11). Their lead\ncharacter was mica, which was \u2018Magnesia, combined with that of Alum\u2019.87 These\nStones were found in Elgin, Nairn and Kincardineshire and were sometimes associated\nwith ceramic production.\nThe lead characters that Walker used to form classes 12 to 14 were taken from\nthe different types of cement that held them together. At first glance, using cement as\na classification character might seem a bit odd. But it is here that we can see how\nthe chemistry of Edinburgh\u2019s Medical School, as practised in relation to pharmaceu-\nticals and emerging industrial practices, had direct application to natural history.\nSince the early part of the century, laboratory experiments on the \u2018cement\u2019 of\nbladder stones had been a reccurring activity in the school.88 This research was\n81 This is further qualified: \u2018This class comprehends the Bodies which strike Fire with Steel, and are\ncomposed of Siliceous Earth.\u2019 An Epitome of Natural History, op. cit.

For example, Bergman\u2019s Physical and\nChemical Essays addressed \u2018Progress for burning bricks\u201991 and Brian Higgins gave an\naccount of Experiments and Observations Made with the View of Improving the Art\nof Composing and Applying Calcareous Cements (1780). Drawing from \u2018the chaste\nand philosophical productions of Dr. Black\u2019,92 Higgins performed experiments on\ncementation that had direct application not only to the construction of buildings\nbut also to the chemical composition of strata. At one point, he treats both natural\nand man-made aggregated calcareous bodies as if they shared the same chemical\ncomposition.93\nBuilding on his knowledge of cementation, Walker held that classes 12 to 14 were the\nlarge rocks that formed the bulk of primary strata, the lowest observable layer of the\nEarth and the foundation on which all other stones rested. The names for these classes\nwere as follows:\nClass 12: Petr\u00e6\nClass 13: Saxa\nClass 14: Concreta\nWalker defined Petr\u00e6 Stone (Class 12) as both \u2018heterogeneous\u2019 and \u2018Simple\u2019.

These are chemically significant because their cubical shape would have been held\nto be the product of a chemical reaction. As these shapes resembled large crystalline structures, Walker\nthought that they were essentially the result of a bygone chemical process.An Epitome of Natural History, op.\ncit. (51), 708D, f. 30.

A Treatise on Rocks, 2\nvols., London, 1811, i, 530. Walker\u2019s usage in 1797 lectures demonstrates that it was clearly being used much\nearlier. It is most likely that the word was imported from its eighteenth-century usage in botany and zoology\n(which are recorded in the OED). Additionally, Walker employed the vernacular equivalent of this word in\nthe field notes that he took in the Hebrides earlier in his career. He used it to describe the composition of\nPorphyry on the Island of Tiree. This means that the term was being used during the 1760s. See Walker\u2019s\nReport, op. cit.

As the name indicates, the lead character was the Salt Principle\nitself (e.g. not a Primary or Secondary manifestation of the principle). The priority that\nhistories of chemistry often give to the implementation of the new French nomenclature\nsometimes allows scholars to forget that Salts were a vital part of eighteenth-century\nchemical mineralogy.103 They played an important role in Lavoisier\u2019s own intellectual\ndevelopment104 and in 1807 Aikin\u2019s popular Dictionary of Chemistry and Mineralogy\nasserted that the \u2018chemistry of salts, taken in the most extended sense, forms by far the\nlargest part of the whole science\u2019.105 As with Cullen\u2019s mid-century tripartite definition\nof Salts (acid, alkali and neutral),106 Aikin\u2019s Dictionary reiterates that they are sub-\nstances that can be dissolved in water. It then goes on to state that contemporary\nchemists (circa 1800) applied the term \u2018to all the crystallisable acids or alkalis, or earth,\nor combinations of acids with alkalis, earths or metallic oxyds. Hence the common and\nuseful distinction alkaline, earthy and metallic \u2019.107\nAlthough Walker did not cite Aikin in his lectures, his system demonstrates that\nhe combined this late eighteenth-century view with that of the mid-part of the century.\nBy the 1790s he held that there were two types of Salt : Primary and Secondary. These\ntwo divisions were conceptually similar to the role played by Primary and Secondary\nEarths. But instead of using Secondary Salts to form classes, Walker used them to\nform orders. His Primary Salts came in two forms: acids and alkalis. These comprised\nthe first two saline orders. He stated that acids had five genera and that these required\n\u2018no Explanation, and indeed these more properly belong to the Chymist\u2019.108 Alkalis\nhad two genera: Natron and Volatile Alkali. Secondary Salts were combinations of\nPrimary Salts with either themselves, Metals or Earths. These combinations formed the\nlast four orders of Walker\u2019s saline class: Neutrals, Acid-Earths, Alkaline-Earths and\n103 One of the best books on this subject is F. L.

Bergman\u2019s chemistry was also heavily based on saline analysis. See his A Dissertation on Elective\nAttractions, London, 1785, and J. A. Schufle, \u2018Torbern Bergman, earth scientist\u2019, Chymia (1967), 12, 56\u201397,\n87\u201390.\n106 See Eddy, op. cit. (46) and William Cullen, \u2018A Cullen Manuscript of 1753\u2019 (ed.

It should be noted here that William Withering, Cullen\u2019s student, in-\ncluded Cullen\u2019s definition of \u2018Salt\u2019 in his 1783 translation of Bergman\u2019s Mineralogy. Withering held\nBergman\u2019s definition to be inadequate: \u2018I shall, therefore, offer another, given by Dr. Cullen: \u2013 viz. \u2018Saline\nbodies are sapid, miscible with water, and not inflammable. \u2019 Bergman, op. cit.

There he argued that Salt of iron was alkaline.112\nThe fact that Walker was publishing on the classification of Salts as far back as the\n1750s illustrates that he had a long-standing interest in the saline composition of min-\neralwaters.113 In eighteenth-century Scotland, local spas andwellswere a standard testing\nground for saline theories that were also applicable to pharmacology and natural his-\ntory.114 The medicinal use of these wells was popular at this time and lasted well into the\nnineteenth century. For instance, the 1797 re-publication of Cullen\u2019s 1765\/6 Clinical\nLectures promoted the pharmacological use ofwells that contained \u2018metallic substances\u2019\nbecause of their \u2018 tonic power\u2019.115 Cullen\u2019s book, like many publications at the end of the\n109 Cullen, op. cit.

In addition to general chemistry\nbooks, he read several specialized treatises on the subject. The index of the library that he kept during the\n1760s (Index Librorum, EUL, DC.2.38) contains several Philosophical Transactions articles on Salts.\nAdditionally, Elliot\u2019s Catalogue, op. cit. (4), contains works that address the manufacture of common salt: N.\nGrew, A Treatise of the Nature and Use of the Bitter Purging Salt\u2026, London, 1697, EC 21; J.

Cochrane, The Present State of the Manufacture of Salt Explained\u2026, London, 1785, EC 493.\nBrownrigg and Dundonald\u2019s work also was known on the continent. Gerhard Stalla, Salz in Bayern, eine\nBibliographie, Augsburg, 1995, 9.\n114 A good example of this practice can be seen Rev. William Laing\u2019sAn Account of Peterhead, its Mineral\nWell, Air and Neighbourhood, London, 1793. In addition to addressing the medical benefits of the well, Laing\n(who also held an MD) based much of his chemical analysis on the work of Torbern Bergman. For more on\nthe therapeutic context of these wells in Scotland, see A. Durie, \u2018Medicine, health and economic development:\nPromoting spa and seaside resorts in Scotland c. 1750\u20131830\u2019, History of Medicine (2003), 47, 195\u2013216.\n115 William Cullen, Clinical Lectures, Delivered in the Years 1765 and 1766 \u2026 Taken in Short-Hand by a\nGentleman Who Attended, London, 1797, 73\u20134.\nThe late mineralogical career of the \u2018 ingenious \u2019 Professor John Walker 393\ncentury, utilized saline analysis when testing the composition of such waters.116 Thus, as\na member of the Medical Faculty, Walker, like Black, included a saline class in his\nmineralogical system because Salts were still a vital part of contemporary chemical\npractice \u2013 especially in therapeutics and experimental pharmacology. In Edinburgh,\nsaline analysis had also become connected to the study of \u2018airs \u2019, specifically in reference\nto how water could be impregnated with them. At this time, both natural and artificial\naerated waters were prescribed by Edinburgh\u2019s physicians for stomach and digestive\nailments. It was probably for this reason that Walker took manuscript notes on Joseph\nPriestley\u2019sObservations on Different Kinds of Air and Karl Wilhelm Scheele\u2019s Chemical\nObservations and Experiments on Air and Fire during the 1780s.117\nWalker\u2019s personal manuscripts also reveal that he took notes on the saline compo-\nsition of mineral waters from the works of John Elliot (who based his work on Priestley)\nand Bergman.118 Indeed the preface to Elliot\u2019s book was subtitled \u2018Directions for\nimpregnating water with fixed air\u2019 and Walker\u2019s notes on Bergman were entitled\n\u2018Precipitants for Mineral Waters\u2019. The latter even included a chart that lists which Salts\nwere present in water taken from the spas at Selzer, Bath and Pyrmont.119 Corre-\nspondingly, Walker\u2019s library was stocked with related works by Baron Montesquieu,\nThomas Short, Donald Monro, Alexander Sutherland andWilliam Simpson.120 He used\nsaline analysis not only in his mineralogy lectures but throughout all of his other lectures\nand publications. A good example of this occurred in his hydrography lectures where he\ncited saline experiments to demonstrate the chemical composition of the ocean, rain,\n116 The relevance of medicinal waters in Edinburgh\u2019s medical community is treated in Maehle, op. cit.\n(70), and in A. Durie, \u2018Medicine, health and economic development: Promoting spa and seaside resorts in\nScotland c. 1750\u20131830\u2019, Medical History, 47 (2003), 195\u2013216.\n117 Walker\u2019s notes on Joseph Priestley\u2019s Observations on Different Kinds of Air, London, 1772, are con-\ntained in the bound MS volume entitled Essays, Transcripts and Other Papers II, EUL DC.1.58 f. 44. There\nwere many editions of Priestley\u2019s book and Elliot\u2019s Catalogue, op. cit. (4). EC 99 states that Walker owned a\n1772 edition and his personal notes suggest that he possibly owned another later one. Walker also had read\n(circa 1782) Karl Wilhelm Scheele\u2019s Chemical Observations and Experiments on Air and Fire.

Note his treatment of \u2018Hard Water \u2019 : \u2018These pit springs will not\nmake a lather with Soap; the reason is that they always either contain an earthy or\nmetallic salt, and hence they decompose the soap by the acid in the saline matter at-\ntracting the Alkali of the soap and leaving its oleaginous part disengaged. \u2019121\nThe lead classification character for Inflammables (Class 16) was the Inflammable\nPrinciple. It had five orders \u2013 Airs, Sulphurs, Bitumens, Coals and Electric(al) \u2013 and it\nis unclear if Walker held that these substances were Primary representations of the\nprinciple itself. (This being said, Walker was a local expert on the chemical qualities of\npeat moss.)122 As the concept of an \u2018aer\u2019 touched on various aspects of his mineralogy\n(especially in relation to aerial acids and mineral waters), Walker\u2019s reading of\nPriestley\u2019sObservations and Scheele\u2019s Experiments no doubt influenced his thoughts on\nthe matter. Additionally, many of the chemical mineralogies in his library emphasized\nan air\u2019s ability to decompose exposed stones. \u2018Air \u2019 at this time was also conceptually\nlinked to electricity because the latter was sometimes thought to be a \u2018fluid\u2019 form of\nenergy that used \u2018air \u2019 as a medium. The attention that Walker paid to \u2018Coals \u2019 also\nhad chemical aspects to it. Its very place in his classification system was dependent upon\nits ability to burn \u2013 which, of course, was a chemical quality. Although he did own\nbooks that treated the chemistry of coal composition,123 his published letter to Colonel\nDirom (1800) demonstrates that he was just as interested in its physical placement in\nstrata.124\nWalker\u2019s last three classes (17\u201319) dealt with the subject of metals. Aside from the\nmetallurgical references made in his mineralogy lectures (which are numerous), his\nlibrary contained older texts like Agricola\u2019sDe ReMetallica and more recent works like\nGellert\u2019s Metallurgic Chymistry and Jars\u2019s Voyages Me\u00b4tallurgiques.125 Other sources\nfor this area were the visits Walker made to Scottish mines early in his career and the\nexperiments being conducted by fellow Edinburgh chemists like Black.126 The lead\n121 Walker, op. cit.

Vaccari has recently treated how mining contributed to Enlightenment conceptions of the earth:\n\u2018Mining and knowledge of the earth in eighteenth-century Italy\u2019, Annals of Science (2000), 57, 163\u201380.\nAccounts of travels made by naturalists to both homeland and foreign mines, moors andmineral wells, though\noften hard to find, provide a wealth of information for historians interested in the classification systems.\nLinnaeus, with whomWalker corresponded in the 1760s, was the archetypical example of such a traveller. His\ntravels are treated in W. Blunt, Linnaeus: The Compleat Naturalist, Princeton, 2001, and L. Koerner,\nLinnaeus: Nature and Nation, Cambridge, MA, 1999.\nThe late mineralogical career of the \u2018 ingenious \u2019 Professor John Walker 395\ncharacter for Metals (Class 19) was the Metal Principle and its orders were groupings of\nPrimary Metals based on malleability : durable (iron and copper), flexible (lead and tin)\nand fixed (silver and gold). The lead characters of the two other \u2018metallic \u2019 classes were\nSecondary Metals : Semimetals (Class 18) and Mundicks (Class 17 \u2013 also called\nPyrites).127 The orders of these classes were based on chemical distinctions common in\neighteenth-century chemistry \u2013 mineralized and calciformed:128\nMundicks (Class 17) Semimetals (Class 18)\nOrder 1: Sulphure\u00e6 (mineralized) Order 1: Sulphure\u00e6 (mineralized)\nOrder 2: Arsenicals (mineralized) Order 2: Arsenicals (mineralized)\nOrder 3: Ferreo (calciformed) Order 3: Fluida (?)\nOrder 4: Amandina (calciformed) Order 4: Dubia (?)\nKnowledge of metals and semimetals was of direct importance to mining. Physicians\nwere often approached by landowners to inspect mines and to give advice on assaying.\nWalker\u2019s career abounds with examples of the practice. He used his mineralogical\nknowledge to inspect Lord Hopetoun\u2019s mines and to become a scientific advisor to Lord\nBute and this experience allowed him to write the letter to Colonel Dirom mentioned\nabove. Finally, metals played a key role in Edinburgh\u2019s experimental pharmacology.\nThey were used in many drugs (expectorants and anthelminthics, for example) and\nfigured in therapeutic practices being developed in Edinburgh\u2019s Royal Infirmary.\nConclusion\nThis essay has shown that the mineralogical system taught by Rev. Dr John Walker at\nthe University of Edinburgh was founded upon principle-based chemistry. In focusing\non this topic, I have touched upon an area of chemical mineralogy that is often over-\nshadowed by secondary literature interested in excavating the \u2018forerunners\u2019 of\nLavoisier, especially his experiments on \u2018airs \u2019. However, a simple glance at the\nchemically related articles and chapters in most British, Swedish and German books\nand journals written during the middle and later decades of the eighteenth century\n(including the Philosophical Transactions) will show that experiments that used the\nprinciples of Earth, Salt, Fire, Water and Metal were more numerous than those that\ninvestigated air. In fact, even pneumatic chemists transferred the language of mineral-\nogical composition to the study of \u2018aerial liquids\u2019. For instance, in a 1784 letter written\nby Charles Blagden to the French translator of Henry Cavendish\u2019s 1780s eudiometry\n127 Traditionally, pyrites (also called mundicks) included rocks that sparked when struck against steel or\nother hard bodies. See \u2018Pyrites\u2019 article in Aikin and Aikin, op. cit. (105). This mineral distinction is used to\ndescribe marcasites and spars in N. Grew\u2019s Musaeum Regali Societatis, London, 1681, which is not in the\nCatalogue, but no doubt would have been available to Walker via one Edinburgh\u2019s many libraries.\n128 For example, see Wallerius\u2019s section on metals and semimetals in his Systema Mineralogicum, op. cit.\n(33). Also see J. R. Partington\u2019s comments on this aspect of Wallerius\u2019s thought in A History of Chemistry, 3\nvols., London, 1962, iii, 169\u201372.Walker defines \u2018calciformed\u2019 as \u2018The Form of Calx, which is where theMetal\nhas been reduced from its metallic or reguline State to a Calx by a particular Solvent. The most General Form\nof this Sort is that of an Ochre\u2019; whereas \u2018mineralized\u2019 was \u2018Where it [the metallic substance] is combined\neither with Sulphur or Arsenic\u2019. An Epitome of Natural History, op. cit. (51), 709D, ff. 155\u20136.\n396 M. D. Eddy\nexperiments, Blagden used the following mineralogical analogy to explain the\n\u2018standard\u2019 scale that Cavendish had developed to classify the purity of the air :\nStandard \u2026 means properly that fixed measure to which others are compared, but in a more\ngeneral sense is used by us to express the proportion which any thing bears to a fixed measure:\nthus if a mixture was made of 3 parts of gold & one of base metal, we might say that the\nstandard of the mixture was 3\/4.129\nUsing the characters derived from principle-based chemistry, Walker\u2019s final system\nconsisted of nineteen classes and drew from his own knowledge of chemistry, from the\nexpertise of Medical School colleagues and from a pool of publications influenced by\ncontinental thinkers.130 Even though mineralogy was often mentioned in the Medical\nSchool\u2019s chemistry courses, Walker\u2019s lectures were the only ones that offered a com-\nprehensive system. Although Black lectured on limited aspects of mineralogy and ge-\nology, he was more interested in discussing basic classification issues that were directly\nrelevant to an introductory chemistry course \u2013 a practice that he frankly admitted.\nWhen his students wanted to pursue the connections between chemistry and mineral-\nogical systematics, he told them to consult Wallerius, Cronstedt, Bergman, William\nWithering and Richard Kirwan. Should the writings of these and other authors need to\nbe explained in detail, Black specifically referred them to Walker by stating, \u2018my col-\nleague, the Professor of Natural History, will give you information of all the parti-\nculars. In this [chemistry] course we have not the time to follow the subject so far, but\nmust confine our attention to the most remarkable and distinguished chemical varieties\nwhich occur in Nature\u2019.131\nThroughout this essay I have emphasized that Walker operated within a context that\nwas influenced by the chemically trained physicians who taught in Edinburgh\u2019s Medical\nSchool. The experiments performed there were often applicable not only to therapeutics\nand pharmacology but also to the mineralogical composition of geological strata and\nScotland\u2019s manufacturing and mining industries. Because of their chemical training,\nEdinburgh\u2019s physicians were able to make analogical comparisons between stones\ntaken out of the ground and bladder stones taken out of the human body.

McCormmach, Cavendish: The Experimental Life,\nLewisburg, 1998, 358\u20139. This book rightly points out that Cavendish had a substantial interest in mineralogy\nand geology. See Chapter 6, \u2018Mercury\u2019, and Chapter 7, \u2018Earth\u2019, 393\u2013460. I must thank David Pantalony for\npointing this source out to me.\n130 How the Latin, Swedish, French and German versions of these books ended up in Edinburgh would\nmake an interesting study and would help uncover the routes by which scientific knowledge was transferred\nbetween different linguistic contexts. To this goal, C. Warren\u2019s recent work in this area is a firm foot forward:\n\u2018Charles Elliot\u2019s medical publications and the international book trade\u2019, in Science and Medicine in the\nScottish Enlightenment (ed. C. W. J. Withers and P. Wood), East Linton, 2002, 215\u201354. The \u2018Short title-list of\nCharles Elliot\u2019s medical publications\u2019 on pages 237 to 254 also contains a good number of chemistry books.\nFor a brief look at Swedish books translated into English, see Swedish Museum of National Antiquities, The\nHeritage from Newton to Linnaeus: Scientific Links between England and Sweden in Bygone Times,\nStockholm, 1962.\n131 Black, op. cit. (110), ii, 20. Black then goes on to give a rudimentary mineralogical arrangement on\npages 20 to 169. These sections are more concerned with enumerating experiments that employ minerals than\nwith working out the specific characters of classification.\nThe late mineralogical career of the \u2018 ingenious \u2019 Professor John Walker 397\nscale, the role played by medico-chemistry in Enlightenment theories of the Earth\nremains largely unexplored.132 Like Higgins\u2019s book, the chemical language of Walker\u2019s\nmineralogy lectures was the same as that which was being used in Edinburgh labora-\ntories and suggests that this time period saw no need to differentiate between calcareous\nmixtures formed in the earth, by masons or in a laboratory crucible. Such a situation is\nrelevant to nascent geological practices because it also implies that Walker and his\ncontemporaries saw little chemical difference between the \u2018cement \u2019 of Highland\nstratigraphic formations and the \u2018concretions\u2019 of the human body.\nMethodologically speaking I have drawn attention to the fact that Walker\u2019s miner-\nalogical system depended upon two recurring taxonomic distinctions: primary and\nsecondary. In general, the idea of \u2018primary\u2019 and \u2018secondary\u2019 divisions played a notable\nrole in eighteenth-century natural philosophy. In fact, further treatments of the use of\nthese distinctions would shed much light on a wide variety of early modern classifi-\ncation systems (both for nosology and natural history).133 From a philosophical\nperspective, the primary and secondary manifestations of Earths, Salts and Metals\nbore a striking resemblance to Locke\u2019s primary and secondary ideas. Such a situation\nwould have been favourably received in Edinburgh since Cullen discussed An Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding in his lectures134 and since Locke\u2019s epistemology\nwas so prevalent in Scotland.135 As James McCosh stated in the nineteenth century,\n\u2018The Scottish metaphysicians largely imbibed the spirit of Locke; all of them speak with\nprofound respect ; and they never differ from him without expressing regret or offering\napology. \u2019136 Yet, as McCosh went on to write, \u2018 the Scottish school never adopted the\nfull theory of Locke\u2019 and this led to a wide variety of interpretations. Working out just\nhow many of these interpretations trickled into natural history and chemistry in\nScotland is a task that remains to be fulfilled.\n132 This would even be the case for James Hutton, whose 1785 Royal Society of Edinburgh papers on his\ntheory of the earth drew from the concepts of bodily circulation that he advocated in his 1749 Leiden medical\nthesis. Early in the century, the English author William Hobbs summed up a similar approach (circa 1716)\nwhen he wrote, \u2018It appearing, by what has been Said, That the Earth cannot be an animated Body, without an\ninternal Heat and motion, or pulsation: we Shall therefore endeavour to prove that those Properties or\nQuallifications, are to be found in the Earth, as certainly as in any other Animall. \u2019 Roy Porter (ed.), The Earth\nGenerated and Anatomized by William Hobbs: An Early Eighteenth-Century Theory of the Earth, Ithaca,\n1981, 61.\n133 For chemistry, a good place to start would be Robert Boyle\u2019s \u2018simple\u2019 and \u2018compound\u2019 distinctions\nused by Cullen in the 1750s andMacquer\u2019s primary and secondary \u2018principles \u2019 in hisDictionary of Chemistry\n(tr. James Kier), London, 1777. The former distinction was brought forth into mineralogy via Cullen\u2019s con-\nception of a \u2018simple\u2019 and \u2018structured\u2019 stone. Additionally, several eighteenth-century chemists \u2013 Domenico\nGuglielmini and Bergman, for example \u2013 used the concept of \u2018primary\u2019 (primitive geometrical form) and \u2018sec-\nondary\u2019 to classify crystals. See R. Hookyaas, \u2018Torbern Bergman\u2019s crystal theory\u2019, Lychnos (1952), 16, 21\u201354.\n134 A. L. Donovan, Philosophical Chemistry in the Scottish Enlightenment, Edinburgh, 1975, 42\u20134.\n135 Although it could be argued that these distinctions were gleaned independently via ancient and early\nmodern taxonomical arguments that were often read in the form of Aristotle\u2019s Categories. For reference, see\nJohn Wilkins\u2019s An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language, London, 1668, or even\nRobert Boyle\u2019s numerous comments on classification in Peter Shaw\u2019s collected edition of his works, The\nPhilosophical Works of the Honourable Robert Boyle Esq., London, 1738.\n136 James McCosh, The Scottish Philosophy, Biographical, Expository, Critical, from Hutcheson to\nHamilton, London, 1875, 28\u20139. Here McCosh used the term \u2018metaphysician\u2019 to denote philosophers like\nHutcheson, Hume, Reid and so on, whom he held to be key thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment.\n398 M. D. Eddy\nThis being the case, it is interesting to note that Walker applied the primary, sec-\nondary and tertiary hierarchical distinctions to the strata of the earth in his lectures on\ngeology. This tradition was also followed by early nineteenth-century geological sys-\ntems based on both chemical and natural (stratigraphic) characters.137 Walker\u2019s use of\nchemistry to determine the mineralogical composition of geological strata suggests that\nhistories of the nascent earth sciences that have ignored chemical composition are ne-\nglecting a vast early modern experimental culture that viewed the earth in stringently\nanalytic terms. Equally, histories of chemistry have also overlooked this culture because\nits complex principle-based system does not conform to the later historiographical\nprecedent given to Lavoisier and the new nomenclature. This situation is made even\nmore challenging when one realizes that mineralogists often used several different types\nof lead chemical character (e.g. those based on principles and primary and secondary\nqualities). In this essay I have called attention not only to the relevance of Walker\u2019s\nsystem but also to the many other mineralogists who, like him, would have been happy\nto defer to a hammer and a crucible when analysing the terraqueous globe.\nA comparison of the classes of Walker\u2019s mineralogical systems\n1781138 1790139 1795\/7140\n1.
