It is unclear whether these differences can be explained by the varying circumstances in which different generations grew up or by other factors that vary within an individual\u2019s life time. This article tests a model which proposes that generation determines the level of Internet use and life stage determines gender differences in Internet use. Descriptive analyses of a representative sample of 1,578 British Internet users confirm that there continue to be small but significant gender differences for most uses of the Internet.

It is unclear whether these differences can be explained by the varying circumstances in which different generations grew up or by other factors that vary within an individual\u2019s life time. This article tests a model which proposes that generation determines the level of Internet use and life stage determines gender differences in Internet use. Descriptive analyses of a representative sample of 1,578 British Internet users confirm that there continue to be small but significant gender differences for most uses of the Internet. The findings from a series of linear regressions suggest that gender differences vary for different life stages related to occupation and marital status. This is true especially for typically male uses. The article concludes that other factors related to life stage will continue to influence gender differences in Internet use in the future.<\/dc:description><dc:publisher>\n        Sage<\/dc:publisher><dc:date>\n        2010-06<\/dc:date><dc:type>\n        Article<\/dc:type><dc:type>\n        PeerReviewed<\/dc:type><dc:format>\n        application\/pdf<\/dc:format><dc:language>\n        en<\/dc:language><dc:identifier>\n        http:\/\/eprints.lse.ac.uk\/28401\/1\/Gendered%20internet%20use%20across%20generations%20%28LSERO%29.pdf<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\n          Helsper, Ellen  (2010) Gendered internet use across generations and life stages.

One of the offline inequalities that is mirrored online is the \ndifferences between men and women.  \nResearch shows that over the last decade gender differences in access to the \ninternet have decreased and are now very small in countries such as Britain and the US \n(Dutton & Helsper, 2007; Fallows, 2005; ONS, 2007). In spite of near equality in internet \naccess, considerable gender differences continue to be found in breadth of use (Ono & \nZavodny, 2003; Wasserman & Richmond-Abbott, 2005) and internet skills (Broos, 2005; \nHargittai & Shafer, 2006; Joiner et al., 2005; Torkzadeh, Chang, & Demirhan, 2006). \nSince younger generations show smaller gender differences in ICT use (Ono & Zavodny, \n2003, 2007), these differences are argued to be generational and thus temporal. The \nexplanation is that young women\u2019s familiarity with the technology is similar to that of \nyoung men, while older women grew up in an environment that was very different from \nthat of their male peers. If generation is indeed the main determinant of gender \ndifferentiation these differences should disappear over time as older generations die. \nToday\u2019s teenagers grow up in a completely different ICT environment than their parents \nand these generational differences will no doubt influence how they use the internet. If \ndifferences between gender groups are mainly related to generational or cohort effects \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n2 \nthen current teenagers\u2019 behaviors and gender differences can be used to forecast what the \ninformation society will look like in the future. \nHowever, others argue that gender differences in behavior are shaped as much by \nsocialization as by generation (Gill & Grint, 1995; Herring, 2002; Selwyn, 2007; Singh, \n2001; Wajcman, 2004). The latter scenario implies that \u2018real life\u2019 gender roles vary \nbetween men and women depending on the stage of life they are at (eg. marital status, \noccupation, parenthood). It follows that if gender differences in ICT use are linked to life \nstage, they will continue to persist in the future. If a main determinant of differences in \nICT use is indeed life stage instead of cohort, then there might be a change in current \nteenagers\u2019 behavior when they marry or are employed. The behavior of adults who \ncurrently find themselves at these life stages would in this case be a better predictor of \nwhat future adult online behavior will look like than young people\u2019s current behavior. \nThis paper tries to unpick the roles played by generation and life stages in relation to \ngender differences in internet use in the UK.  \n \nIssues in gender and internet research \nExisting research about the influence of gender on internet use has some \nlimitations. Two main issues are the \u2018generalization\u2019 and \u2018generation and life stage\u2019 \nproblems of internet and gender research.  \nThe first issue, the \u2018generalization problem\u2019, is that research reports often draw \nconclusions about the gendered use of the internet without making distinctions between \ndifferent groups of men and women. In trying to understand the unique effect of gender \non internet use, earlier studies controlled for socio-demographic factors such as \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n3 \ngeneration and socio-economic status as well as for the level of experience that men and \nwomen have with the internet. For example, the Pew Internet and American Life project \nsurveyed 6,403 men and women and showed that gender and age made a difference \n(Fallows, 2005). Men used the internet more broadly and more intensely than women and \nolder people less than younger people (see also Wasserman & Richmond-Abbott, 2005). \nHowever, almost all of these studies fail to make an explicit comparison of gender \ndifferences within different generational, occupational, and other groups. An exception is \na study conducted by Weiser (2000) who found that gender and age did not interact \nsignificantly. In this study, the difference in attitudes towards technologies between men \nand women were similar in all age groups. However, he used non-representative samples \nof 506 undergraduate students and 684 volunteer participants. They participated \nfollowing an advert they were shown if they typed in the words \u2018internet\u2019, \u2018surveys\u2019 and \n\u2018search engine\u2019. This limits the generalizability of this study\u2019s findings. \nThe second, \u2018generation and life stage\u2019 problem, refers to the focus on men and \nwomen of certain generations and occupations when researching internet behavior. The \ncontinued use of university students as subjects for studies leads to the comparison of a \nvery specific group of women with a very specific group of men (eg. Joiner et al., 2005; \nOdell, et al, 2000). More importantly, it leads to the comparison of expert (young and \nhighly educated) women with young expert men. The activities these participants \nundertake are likely to be different from those undertaken by people of the same \ngeneration who are not in education. If the focus is not on students it is often on the use \nof the internet at home, which typically has an overrepresentation of middle aged women \nwith young families (eg. Cummings & Kraut, 2002; Dholakia, 2006; Faulkner, 2002; \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n4 \nLivingstone & Helsper, 2007). Very rarely are gender differences in ICT use studied \namongst individuals with different types of occupations. An exception is a study \nconducted by Ono and Zavodny (2005) which looked at differences between men and \nwomen in different types of employment and those without work in Japan and the US. \nThey found that employment was related to larger gender gaps in Japan, but not in the US \nwhere gender difference were minimal for all groups. They argued that this might be due \nto the type of employment that women and men traditionally occupy in Japan. However, \ntheir study did not distinguish between unemployment, retirement and caretaker functions \nof those who were not in employment. In addition, while the authors did control for other \nlife stage factors such as marital status in their analyses, they did not report on its \nindependent effects. \nThis focus on young students and middle-aged individuals in traditional \nhouseholds and occupations means that older individuals and individuals who live in non-\ntraditional households are often left out of research findings. There are exceptions, such \nas a survey by Selwyn, Gorard, Furlong and Madden (2003), which focused on older \nadults. They found that internet use was stratified according to gender, marital status and \neducational background. However, their sample was restricted to those over 60 and \ntherefore could not be used to compare gender differences across different generational \ngroups. Similarly, Cody, Dunn, Hoppin and Wendt\u2019s (1999) study also argued that life \nstage is as important as age in determining internet use amongst the elderly but did not \noffer a comparison with other generations. Grimes, Hough, and Signorella (2007) \ninvestigated gender differences among employed and retired people and concluded that \nage differences were more pronounced in men than in women. However, since their study \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n5 \nwas restricted to e-mail spam these results might not be generalizable to other uses. \nLoges and Jung (2001) conducted a study that investigated whether the elderly differed \nfrom younger generations in how central the internet was to their lives, they found that \nwhen controlling for other factors there was no such difference. This could be a potential \nargument against a life stage effect. However, this study was focused on ethnic minorities \nand did not take into account gender differences (besides controlling for gender), nor did \nit investigate whether these factors related to different life stages, as opposed to different \nlifestyles as exemplified by internet centrality, had an influence on internet use. \nExisting studies have thus not provided a complete insight into how gender \ninteracts with other socio-demographic factors related to life stage such as occupational \nor marital status. It is therefore difficult to know whether differences between men and \nwomen will disappear as current generations grow older or whether there is something \ninherent to certain life stages which means these differences will persist when young \ngenerations grow older.  \n \nLife stage approach  \nA life stage approach towards gendered behavior proposes that certain positions \nin everyday life encourage individuals to adopt typically female or male roles. Shifts \nbetween life stages are defined in this paper as the traditional points in a person\u2019s life \nwhere daily rhythm and routine alter drastically due to a change in a person\u2019s role in \nsociety. Two types of shifts have been identified as important factors influencing \nindividuals\u2019 lives; occupational shifts and relationship developments. Occupational shifts \nare related to the main activity that occupies a person\u2019s day. Occupational life stage \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n6 \ncycles generally start with education after which most shift to employment. This move \nfrom student to employee is partly marked by a decrease in personal freedom as well as \nby an increase in responsibilities and in disposable income. There are marked gender \ndifferences especially amongst employed men and women. Women are generally in \nlower qualified occupations and are more often caretakers than men (Bobbitt-Zeher, \n2007; Denton & Boos, 2007; Hogan, Perrucci, & Behringer, 2005; Joshi, Makepeace, & \nDolton, 2007; Kangas & Rostgaard, 2007). The next shift in occupational life stages \ncomes when people retire. Amongst students and retirees men\u2019s and women\u2019s \ncircumstances tend to be more equal than during the employment stage. Unemployment \nis also marked as a distinct life circumstance in which men and women tend to be more \nequal than while in employment. \nIn this paper, these distinctions between occupational life stages are assumed to \nbe reflected in internet use, which leads to the following question: \nQ1: Are differences between men and women in internet use largest at the employment \nlife stage? \nA classification of life stages in relationship development starts with very broad \ndistinctions between being single and being in a relationship. Studies of gender roles in \nrelationships usually compare cohabiting and married couples. An exception is a study by \nSouth and Pitze (1994) which compared cohabiting and married individuals with \ndivorced and widowed individuals. They found, as did a number of other studies, that the \ndistribution of activities at home was more traditionally gendered in married couples (See \nalso Barber & Axinn, 1998; Brown, 2003). Changes in behavior between marital status \nstages are generally larger for women; men appear to have more stable patterns of \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n7 \nbehavior related to gender roles. Furthermore, cohabiting women tend to be more similar \nto single women than to married women unless both partners see the cohabitation as a \nprecursor to marriage (Rindfuss & Van Den Heuvel, 1990). In summary, marriage still \ntends to introduce the most drastic shift related to relationships in offline gendered \nbehavior. Parenthood is often studied in addition to marital status as an indicator of life \nstage. Becoming a parent has been found to amplify gendered roles in relationships \n(Belsky & Pensky, 1988; Cowan & Cowan, 1992). This paper asks the following \nquestion to understand if relationship stages are reflected in online behavior. \nQ2: Are gendered patterns of online behavior more pronounced within individuals who \nare in a long term relationship and for individuals with children? \nGender differences are likely to be related to a mix of both life stage and \ngenerational effects. A combination of the aforementioned generation and life stage \napproaches leads to the following hypothesis about a possible interaction effect of \ngender, generation and life stage:  \nH1: Generation has a main effect on internet use with younger people using the internet \nmore than older people, but life stage influences the differences between men and women \nso that differences at some life stages are greater than at other life stages. \n[Figure 1 here] \nFigure 1 illustrates a life stage model in which gender differences within different \ngenerational groups are said to be influenced by life stage, while the average level of use \nis determined by generation. \n \nGendered internet use \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n8 \nThe internet provides a range of different opportunities for engagement. This \npaper will examine the relationship between life stage and internet use (questions 1 and \n2) and test hypothesis 1 for general internet use and three specific uses of the internet \nwhich have been linked to gender differences in past work.  \nPrevious research has established that men and women differ as regards the online \ncontent and platforms they engage with. In this context communication and entertainment \nare the most commonly studied activities. Communication is considered more typically \nfemale and entertainment typically male (Faulkner, 2002; Jackson, et al, 2001; Li & \nKirkup, 2007; Shaw & Grant, 2002; Weiser, 2000). This is not to say that communication \nand entertainment are clearly defined, separate activities; communication can be \nentertaining and online entertainment can involve communication. However, different \nplatforms carry signifiers as regards the primary function of what they offer (eg. games \nare primarily for entertainment and chat rooms primarily for communication). Similarly, \ndifferent types of content are classifiable in terms of their primary function independent \nof how they are used in practice.  \nThere is ample evidence for male types of internet content, that is, there are \nplatforms that are clearly dominated by men with low female participation. These tend to \nbe sexual and entertainment focused (eg. game playing) (Papastergiou & Solomonidou, \n2005; Traeen, Nilsen, & Stigum, 2006; Weiser, 2000). In contrast, the research discusses \na narrower range of clearly female types of sites or activities. One of these is the search \nfor health information (Escoffery et al., 2005; Karavidas, Lim, & Katsikas, 2005; Warner \n& Procaccino, 2007).  Anderson et al (2004) in one of the only truly longitudinal panel \nstudies in this area showed that online health searches were more frequent amongst older \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n9 \nwomen who tended to use the internet at someone else\u2019s home. An online activity that is \nless clearly gendered is internet shopping. Shopping is an interesting activity in \ncomparison to other behaviors because women tend to engage more in shopping offline. \nHowever, online shopping which includes \u2018window shopping\u2019 on price comparison sites \nand actual purchases often shows the opposite pattern, with men being more active \nshoppers than women on the internet (Dittmar, Long, & Meek, 2004; Garbarino & \nStrahilevitz, 2004; Wolin & Korgaonkar, 2003). Nevertheless, there is some evidence to \nthe contrary as well particularly when it comes to younger generations, Gross (2004) \nfound that teenage girls shop more online than boys do.  The general male dominance of \nonline shopping might be related to it being interpreted as part of a wider class of \nactivities that could be labeled economic or financial which also include banking and \ninvesting. These are primarily aimed at saving money or acquiring goods and not on the \nmore experiential type of consumption as described by Holt (1995). Offline functional \nconsumption is dominated by men and experiential consumption tends to be more female \n(Ditmar et al 2004; Holbrook & Hirschbrun 1982). While gender differences have also \nbeen found for general information seeking and more participatory activities (see Dutton, \nHelsper & Gerber 2009) this paper focuses on those activities that are most clearly \ngendered and where life stage differences might be expected. \nAfter a descriptive analysis of the differences in the UK between men and women \non the most common internet uses, this paper will examine the influence of life stage and \ngeneration on three uses; one clearly male (sexual material), one female (health searches) \nand one that in the offline world is female gendered but which is less clearly gendered \nonline (shopping). H1 is tested for these specific uses to understand whether the patterns \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n10 \nof interaction between gender, life stage and generation differ for clearly and \nambiguously gendered uses. \n \nMethodology \nThis paper uses 2007 data from the Oxford Internet Survey (OxIS)1. These OxIS \nsurveys used a nationally representative random sample of 2,350 people aged 14 and \nolder in Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). Interviews were conducted face-to-face \nin people's homes. A two-stage random sampling design was used. First, a random \nsample of 175 areas in Britain was selected, stratified by region. Then, within each \nselected area, a random sample of 10 addresses was selected from the UK Postal Address \nFile. The data were weighted according to the UK Census based on gender, age, socio-\neconomic grade, and region. The response rate using this sampling strategy was 77%.  \nThe analyses in this paper use the data of the 1,578 internet users. \n \n \nMeasures \nFour categories of variables were created from OxIS to be able to conduct the \nanalyses and test the hypotheses: gender, generation, life stage, and internet use. The \nconstruction of these variables is described in this section. \n \nGender, Generation and Life stage \n[Table 1 here] \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n11 \nGeneration The participant was asked in which year they were born. 10 year periods \nwere interpreted as delineating generations, with the exception of the youngest \nparticipants which were split into a generation of teenagers and young adults to account \nfor possible generational differences between first and second generation digital natives \n(see Helsper & Eynon, in press): 14-17 yrs, 18 to 24 yrs, 25 to 34 yrs, 35 to 44 yrs, 45 to \n54 yrs, 55 to 64 yrs, 65 to 74 yrs, 75 + yrs. This scale from 1 to 8 was used as an ordinal \nvariable in the regressions presented in the paper.   \n \nGender was noted by the interviewer - the distribution of men and women was equal over \nthe sample.  \nLife stage was divided into \u2019marital status\u2019, \u2018occupation\u2019 and \u2018children\u2019. \n\u2018Marital status\u2019 was measured through the question: \u201cAre you\u2026? \u2018Single\u2019, \n\u2018Married\u2019, \u2018Living together with a partner\u2019, \u2018Divorced, separated\u2019 or \u2018Widowed\u2019.\u201d \n\u2018Occupation\u2019 was based on the question\u201d Which of these descriptions best \ndescribes your current situation?\u201d Five categories were created: \u2018Student\u2019 (Part time, full \ntime, postgraduate and undergraduate), \u2018Employed\u2019 (part-time and full time employed), \n\u2018Retired\u2019, \u2018Unemployed\u2019 (unemployed or unable to work) and \u2018Caretakers\u2019 (doing \nhousework or looking after the children). \n\u2018Children\u2019 measured whether or not there were people under 18 in the household. \n \nFor the regressions presented in this paper the Gender, Marital, Occupation, and Children \nvariables were dummy coded based on the categories described above.  \n \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n12 \nInternet behavior  \nA factor analysis identified different classes of applications and content out of all \nthe internet use variables available in OxIS (see Author 2008). Three types were selected \nfor detailed analysis based on their gendered nature as observed in previous research. \nSexual material searches and health information searches showed up as single item \nmeasures, while the other classes of content all consisted of several items that loaded \nhigher than .30 on a related factor. Participants were asked for all activities \u2018How often \ndo you\u2026?\u2019 and answered on a scale ranging from 1 \u2018never\u2019 to 6 \u2018several times a day\u2019 \n(intermediate categories were \u2018daily\u2019, \u2018weekly\u2019, \u2018monthly\u2019, \u2018less than monthly\u2019). \nThe \u2018Sexual material\u2019 question asked how often people looked for \u2018Sites with \nadult (sexual) content\u2019 (M = 1.25; SD = .73).   \nThe \u2018Health\u2019 question asked how often people looked for information on health \nand medical care on the internet (M = 2.13; SD = 1.05).   \n\u2018Shopping\u2019 was a composite measure how often people said they \u2018Get information \nabout a product or service\u2019, \u2018Buying a product or service online\u2019, \u2018Making travel \nreservations\/bookings\u2019 and how often they \u2018Compare products online\u2019. The scores across \nthese items were averaged (M = 2.54; SD = .78, \u03b1 =.78). \nFor the descriptive analyses seven additional classes of content were selected \nfrom the factors identified, these classes of content can be roughly grouped into the \ncommunication, entertainment and economic participation categories identified earlier as \npotentially interesting in terms of gender distinctions.2  \nCommunication \u2013 Social networking and Personal communication \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n13 \n\u2018Online Social Networking\u2019, the only activity with a five point scale (from 0 to 4) \nwhich measured whether participants had posted messages on discussion boards, kept a \nblog, created a website, and whether they had created a social networking profile in the \nlast year (M = .65; SD = 1.06 , \u03b1 =.72). \u2018Online Personal Communication\u2019 measured how \noften internet users participated in the following activities on the internet (\u2018Instant \nmessaging\u2019, \u2018Emailing\u2019, \u2018Chat rooms\u2019, and \u2018Making phone calls using the internet\u2019) (M = \n2.69; SD = .98 , \u03b1 =.72).  \nEntertainment \u2013 Play, Entertainment, and Leisure \n \u2018Play\u2019 measured how frequently internet users \u2018played games online\u2019 and \n\u2018participated in betting and gambling\u2019 (M = 1.62; SD = .84, r2=.18, p < .0001). The \n\u2018Entertainment\u2019 variable referred to how often people \u2018downloaded music\u2019, \u2018downloaded \nvideos\u2019, and \u2018listened to a radio station\u2019 (M = 1.92; SD = .67, \u03b1 =.70). \u2018Leisure\u2019 \nmeasured the frequency with which participants looked for information on \u2018travel\u2019 and \n\u2018local events\u2019 (M = 2.40; SD = .87, r2 =.30, p < .0001).  \nEconomic participation - Online finance \n\u2018Finances\u2019 measured how often people used the internet to manage their personal \nand household finances (\u2018Paying bills\u2019, \u2018Use bank\u2019s online services\u2019, \u2018Checking \ninvestments in stocks\/funds\/bonds\u2019) (M = 1.88; SD = .94, , \u03b1 =.75). \n \nBreadth of use \nThis variable measured the range of activities that people undertake on the \ninternet, a scale that ranged from 0 to 55 (the sum of all the online activities measured in \nthe survey) and which gave equal weight to entertainment, information, commercial, \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n14 \npolitical and other types of activities (Mdn = 19; M = 19.23; SD = 8.86, \u03b1 =.91). The \nindividual items have been listed in the 2007 OxIS report (Dutton & Helsper, 2007). \n \nFindings: Breadth of Use \nTo establish a baseline for a wide range of online activities, simple descriptive \nanalyses were performed comparing men and women. These two groups were compared \nfor both the average frequency with which they undertook each activity and the \npercentage within each group that undertook the activity in the last year.  \n[Table 2 here] \nTable 2 shows that men undertook all activities more frequently than women with \nthe exception of leisure and health information activities. The only activity that was \nundertaken more frequently by women than men was looking for health information. \nSimilarly, the percentage of men who undertook any particular activity in the last year \nwas almost always higher than the percentage of women who undertook the same \nactivity. There were a few exceptions; men and women did not differ in how likely they \nwere to use the internet for personal communication, finances, online leisure and online \nshopping. Thus, while women used the internet less frequently for personal \ncommunication, finance, and shopping, the likelihood of them doing this at all in the last \nyear did not differ from men. \nThe analyses that follow will examine the relationship between gender, \ngeneration, life stage and breadth of use. This is followed by a discussion of the findings \nin relation to clearly gendered (sexual material and health information) and less clearly \ngendered (shopping) online activities. Moderated stepwise regressions were used to \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n15 \nunderstand if these gender differences in internet use vary by generation and by life stage. \nGender was entered at the first step, the Life stage and Generation variables at the second \nstep, and the interactions terms with Gender at the third step. \n \nFindings: Explaining Breadth of Use  \nThe linear regression presented in Table 3 shows that older internet users \nundertook a narrower range of online activities and that women and men differed in \nbreadth of use only within certain generation groups. Similarly, those who were \nemployed or were students were more active than those of other occupational categories \nand retired people less active than those from other occupational categories.  \n[Table 3 here] \n[Figure 2 here] \nFigure 2 shows that the differences between men and women were largest in the \noldest generations (\u0394 = 3.59 for 65-74yrs and for \u0394 = 6.36 for 75+yrs) and smallest for \nthe generations of so-called digital natives (\u0394 = 0.80 for 14-17yrs and \u0394 = 0.25 for 18-\n24yrs). The differences between men and women of the wartime generation (65 to 74 \nyears) were actually smaller than the differences between some of their younger \ncounterparts. Only from the generation of 35 to 44 year olds onwards did men clearly use \nthe internet more broadly than women and did average breadth of use continuously \ndecrease. In the younger generations the breadth of use was smaller than in the middle-\naged generations. Figure 2 clearly shows a non-linear relationship between generation \nand internet use as well as an interaction between gender and generation (t = 3.58, p < \n.01, see Table 3). \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n16 \n \nFindings on Specific Uses \nTo understand whether the effects of gender, generation and life stage varied for \ndifferently gendered activities, moderated regressions were conducted for sexual \nmaterial, health and shopping activities. As before Gender was entered at the first step, \nthe Life stage and Generation variables at the second step, and the interactions terms with \nGender at the third step.  The descriptive findings supported the gendered nature of health \n(female) and sexual material (male) activities and showed that men used the internet \nmore frequently for shopping than women in the UK (see Table 4). \n[Table 4 here] \nFrom Table 4 one can conclude that for all three uses (looking for sexual material, \nhealth services, and shopping online) gender was a significant independent explanatory \nvariable. In addition, gender in interaction with different life stage characteristics \nexplained two of the three uses significantly. Notably, these were those uses (sexual \nmaterial and online shopping) which were dominated by men. \nAs expected, looking for sexual material was clearly related to the gender of the \nperson. Men were more likely to look for sexual material in all generations (t = -4.03, p \n< .001). Employed users were more likely to look for sexual material (t = 3.64, p < \n.001). In addition, the differences between men and women differed according to life \nstage; unemployment and marriage were the focus of these interactions. Generation did \nnot influence looking for sexual material online neither independently nor in interaction \nwith gender. \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n17 \nFor health searches generation was not a significant factor either, but gender and \nlife stage were significantly related to this type of use. Women looked more frequently \nfor health information than men independent of the life stage or generation group they \nwere in. Employed people were also more likely to search for health information than the \nother occupational groups. No significant interactions between gender, generation and \nlife stage were found for health. \nFor the shopping variable, there were main effects of generation and life stage \nvariables. Older people shopped online less frequently. While employed and cohabiting \npeople shopped more frequently, unemployed people shopped less frequently. In \naddition, the relationship between gender and shopping differed depending on life stage \nand generation, in this case being married influenced this relationship between gender \nand online behavior more than other life stage factors. \nIn Figures 3 through 6 the significant interactions are depicted. Since no \ninteraction effects were found between gender, generation, and life stage for health \nsearches (see Table 4), no graphs are included for these relationships. \n[Figure 3 here] \nFigure 3 illustrates the main effect of gender found in Table 4 that men in all \noccupation groups used the internet more for sexual material than women. Figure 3 also \nshows the interaction between gender and life stage. The difference between men and \nwomen was smallest amongst those who were retired (t = 2.17, 0=.03) and more or less \nequal in the students (t = 3.28, p < .01) and the employed group (t = 6.43, p < .001). \nHome caretaking women were less likely to use the internet for sexual material than \nwomen with other occupations (t = 2.03, p = .04), with the exception of retired women. \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n18 \nAccess to sexual material varied more for men within the different occupations than it did \nfor women. \n[Figure 4 here] \nFigure 4 shows that men looked more for sexual material across all marital status \ngroups. In addition, gender differences varied widely across different marital status \ngroups. Men who were single were 3.5 times as likely (t = 5.23, p < .001) to look for \nsexual material (M = .28; 95% ci= .23-.34) as single women (M = .08; ci = .04-.12), \ncohabiting men (M = .19; ci =.12-.26) 2.3 times as likely (t = 2.87, p < .01)  as \ncohabiting women (M = .08; ci = .03-.13), married men (M = .15; ci =.11-.19) 3 times as \nlikely (t = 4.43, p < .001) as married women (M = .05; ci = .02-.07) and divorced men \n(M = .46; ci = .32-.60) 11.5 times as likely (t = 5.59, p < .001) as divorced women (M = \n.04; ci = .00-.08). While divorce seemed to influence men strongly in their use of sexual \nmaterial, divorce barely changed the use of these types of sites for women.  \n[Figure 5 here] \nFigure 5 depicts the significant interaction between generation and gender (t = \n2.26, p = .02) in relation to online shopping. The differences between men and women \nincreased after middle age, becoming significant for the postwar generation of 56 to 64 \nyears olds (t = 2.67, p < .01) and those born before that. The drop in shopping activities \nfor women was considerable, while men\u2019s shopping behavior remained constant. The \nfigure also shows that generation was not linearly but curvi-linearly related to use; \nyounger and older (female) internet users were less active online shoppers.  \n[Figure 6 here] \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n19 \nFigure 6 shows that differences between men and women in online shopping were \nsmall in all marital status groups, with the exception of the divorced group. The \nlikelihood of shopping online was equal between men and women in the divorced group \n(90% shops online) and while men tended to do so more frequently this difference was \nnot significant (t = 1.73, p = .08). The difference between married men and women in the \nfrequency in which they used the internet for shopping was significant (t = 4.43, p < \n.001)  43% of married men reported doing some type of online shopping activity at least \nonce a month in comparison to 33% of married women. \n \nDiscussion  \nThis paper investigated the interplay between gender, generation and life stage \n(ie. occupation, marital status and parenthood) as regards internet use. The descriptive \nand regression analyses presented showed that the internet is by no means gender neutral, \nand support earlier research which found that men integrate technologies more broadly \ninto their everyday lives than women (Joiner, et al. 2005; Ono & Zavodny, 2003; \nWasserman & Richmond-Abbott, 2005). Seven out of nine internet activities examined \nwere undertaken more frequently by men which suggests that there are more internet \nplatforms that are dominated by men than applications that have a female user base. \n The findings on health searches supported previous research (Escoffery et al, \n2005; Warner & Procacciono, 2007) which suggests that health is one of the few clearly \nfemale activities on the internet. However, in contrast to previous research (Faulkner, \n2002; Jackson, et al, 2001; Shaw & Grant, 2002), the findings showed that women were \nnot more likely to use the internet as a tool to communicate. Activities considered to be \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n20 \ntypically male offline, such as looking for entertainment and sexual material, were also \nundertaken more by men online. Ofcourse it is important to remember that the study used \nself-report measures and that the difference might be influenced by differences in self-\nreport instead of by differences in actual behavior. \nModerated regressions showed that generation also was an important factor in \nexplaining general internet use. Nevertheless, for clearly gendered behaviors (ie. sexual \nmaterial and health searches) generation had no significant independent effect, instead \nlife stage was more important in determining the influence of gender on internet use.  \nThis paper asked two questions related to life stage effects which were addressed \nfor self-reports of typically male (sexual material), female (health) and gender ambiguous \n(shopping) uses of the internet. Q1 asked if differences between men and women in \ninternet use are larger at the employment life stage since life circumstances, such as \nincome and allocation of housework, differ most between men and women at this stage.  \nOnly for the online activity of looking for sexual material were the largest gender \ndifferences found amongst employed, as well as amongst unemployed\/caretaker, men and \nwomen. Based on the literature about offline gendered behavior (Evertsson & Nermo, \n2007; Sayer, 2005), gender patterns were expected to differ less between men and women \nwho were unemployed than between those who were employed and thus the prediction \nthat gendered online patterns directly mirror offline patterns was not fully corroborated.  \nEmployed people, independent of their gender, looked more frequently for health \ninformation and shopped more online, but occupation did not influence the gender \ndifference for these activities (like it did for sexual material searches). Based on the \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n21 \nabove, the tentative answer to Q1 is that life stage (occupational status), significantly \ninfluences the differences between men and women for clearly (male) gendered uses. \nQ2 asked if gendered patterns of online behavior are more pronounced amongst \nindividuals in long term relationships reflecting offline patterns. Interactions between \ngender and marital status were found but these interactions did not mirror findings in \nresearch of offline gendered behavior. Being in a relationship influenced gender \ndifferences for typically male activities (looking for sexual material) but these were \nsmallest, instead of largest, for those who were married or cohabiting. This finding is not \ntoo surprising since within relationships this type of activity is often discouraged and \nthere are outlets within the relationships for sexual needs. A more notable finding is that \nmarital status influenced online sexual material use mainly in men and hardly changed \nthe very low use of these types of sites by women. Divorced men were especially likely \nto look for sexual material while almost no divorced women said they looked for this \ntype of material.  \nFor classes of activities that were more typical of women (ie. health searches) \nthere were no significant marital status relationships with gender differences. Marital \nstatus did influence gender differences in online shopping. Married men in particular \nwere more likely to shop online. The descriptives indicated that in general, online \nshopping is a more male than female behavior. However, the findings in this paper do not \nshow what type of shopping is undertaken more often by men, it could be that online \nshopping concentrates on more expensive purchases, an area traditionally within the \nrealm of men, and not on everyday purchases like groceries (Vogler, Brockmann, & \nWiggins, 2006; Vogler, Lyonette, & Wiggins, 2008). Future research should address this \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n22 \nin more detail. In a pattern opposite to that of looking for sexual material, marital status \nwas related to greater differences in women\u2019s than in men\u2019s behavior. The lowest levels \nof online shopping were found for women who were married or divorced, suggesting that \nthis activity might be taken over by the husband once people get married.  \nIn answer to Q2, the influence of marital status on online shopping and sexual \nmaterial searches suggests that life stage, as measured by marital status, influences \ngender differences only for those activities that men dominate online.  \nSurprising to note is that having children was not related to differences in internet \nuse between men and women nor did it influence the level of use independently. This \nfinding contradicts the research that suggests that having children is the single most \nimportant change in the routines of people\u2019s everyday lives and relationships (Belsky & \nPensky, 1988; Cowan & Cowan, 1992) and an important motivator for older generations \nto use ICTs (van Rompaey, Roe, & Struys, 2002; Venkatesh & Vitalari, 1992).  \nA limitation is that the cohort survey data used to answer Q1 and Q2 do not allow \nfinal conclusions about causal effects of changes in life circumstances. A longitudinal \npanel study would give a better insight into how internet use changes when a person gets \nmarried, when they find employment or when they have children. Nevertheless, the \nregressions did allow for conclusions about the independent effects of generation and life \nstage. \nThe paper proposed and tested a generation-dependent life stage model in which \ngender differences in internet use are determined by life stage but the level of use was \ndetermined by generation (see Figure 1). H1 which tested this model, had to be rejected \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n23 \nfor breadth of use, sexual material and health uses of the internet for different reasons, \nbut there was partial support for this hypothesis in relation to online shopping.   \nH1 has to be rejected for breadth of use because the largest difference between \nmen and women was found for the oldest generations and life stage had no influence on \ngender differences. However, this interaction between generation and gender was not \nlinear and differences between men and women were actually stable in those generations \nover 45 years old where the model predicted the differences would be smaller in older \ngenerations. Those who were younger showed hardly any differences in breadth of use.  \nH1 is also rejected for sexual material because generation did not influence how \nfrequently people looked for this material online even though life stage did. Similarly, \nthis hypothesis was rejected for health searches because generation did not influence how \noften people looked for health information online. The lack of a generational effect might \nbe explained by the non-linearity in the relationship between generation and health \nsearches, where younger and older people use the internet less for health searches. The \nneed to look for health information online for family members at middle age might \noutstrip the need in the older generations to find solutions for their personal health \nproblems. However, having young people in the household did not influence these \nrelationships and an alternative explanation might have to be found. \nFor online shopping H1 can be supported, generation and life stage interacted \nwith shopping online. Differences were smallest within the youngest generations and \nthose who were married showed smaller differences than the divorced men and women \nbut larger than cohabiting and single men and women. While this supports the importance \nof incorporating different aspects of life stage into understandings of gendered internet \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n24 \nuse, it is not obvious that offline patterns are replicated online. The life stages for which \nthe smallest and those where the largest gender differences in shopping were expected \nbased on offline patterns, showed respectively the largest and smallest gender differences \nin online shopping.  \nSome findings were quite surprising and raise questions that probably cannot be \nanswered by quantitative research. Qualitative and longitudinal research could help \nunderstand, for example, what leads to the high level of self-reported sexual material \nsearches in divorced men and what explains the low level of self-reported online \nshopping for single and divorced women.  \n \nConclusions \nThis paper considered gender differences in internet use and whether these varied \nat different life stages and between different generations. It was argued that if generation \nis the main determinant of ICT use, gender differences should become smaller as the \ncurrent ICT savvy generation grows older. On the other hand, if life stage influences ICT \nuse then gender differences might be more stable across generations and the behavior of \nthis young generation might change as they grow older. A generational life stage model \nwas proposed in which the level of use is explained by generational differences, but in \nwhich gender differences are explained by life stage. This paper was able to show that \ngeneration is neither the only nor the most important predictor of gender differences in \ninternet use. Life stage (measured as employment and marital status) influenced the \ndifferences between men and women or had an independent effect for most of the online \nactivities studied. Time is therefore unlikely to \u2018heal\u2019 all gender divides. Offline gender \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n25 \nroles influence online behavior like they do other behavior and this is likely to continue \neven when the current tech savvy generation grows older. Practical issues could underlie \nthis effect of life stage. For example, shopping to support the family might be more \nimportant for women when they are in a stable relationship. Similarly, men might have \nsexual needs which are fulfilled when they are in a stable relationship and which they \ntherefore do not need to seek online. The internet in this sense reflects the practical reality \nof offline life circumstances and online gender differences cannot be seen as separate \nfrom offline gender roles.  \nFurthermore, researchers will need to rethink the influence of generation. A curvi-\nlinear effect of generation was observed. Younger people and older people used the \ninternet less for specific uses than middle-aged. This contradicts the linear effect that is \noften assumed between age and internet use. This could be due to the types of uses \ninvestigated in this paper which were adult in nature. The proposed generational life stage \nmodel might therefore be more appropriate for adult types of uses. The life stage model \nshould be applied to analyses of newer applications to understand whether these gender \ndifferences vary in younger generations as well.  \nThis paper offers support for the importance of life stage in influencing ICT use. \nNevertheless, more research is needed to understand if the internet now serves, like \nhousework traditionally served, as a platform on which gender relations are symbolically \nenacted. \nGendered Internet Use across Generations and Life Stages \n \n26 \nReferences \nAnderson, B.
