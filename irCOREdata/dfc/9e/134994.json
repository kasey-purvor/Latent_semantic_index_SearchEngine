[2], the \nmodel was shown to fit rheological LDPE data in steady-state shear, uniaxial \nelongation, and first normal stress-difference. With the same parameters the model \nalso gave a good fit to experimentally measured vortex opening angles measurements \n                                                 \n\u2217 +44 1274 234 537 \n   E-mail p.olley@bradford.ac.uk in a 5.75:1 contraction ratio axisymmetric die [3]. Variations of the model could give \nnon-zero second normal stress differences [4], and the model had considerable \nsuccess in axisymmetric flows of strain-hardening polymer melt. The salient \nweakness of the model was its failure to give strain-hardening in planar elongation, \nwith simultaneous shear softening; this lead to a general failure to predict vortex \ngrowth in planar contraction flows. A modification to the damping function permitted \nstrain hardening in uniaxial, planar, and biaxial elongation, with simultaneous shear \nsoftening [5]. Simulation of strain-hardening LDPE flows using this model gave \nvortex growth in both axisymmetric and planar contraction flows [5, 6], however the \nmodel had the weakness that the rate of strain-hardening was below that seen in \nexperiment [5]. \n \nA molecularly based model, the Molecular Stress Function (MSF) model was \ndemonstrated to fit transient planar, uniaxial, and biaxial elongational data for long \nchain branched polymers, and to fit both first and second normal stress difference \nmeasurements in flows of un-branched polymer [7-10]. This was achieved with only a \nsingle adjustable parameter, originally used in a \u201cfit-function\u201d, that related relative \ndeformation to tube-stretch. The particular model given in [10] gave very significant \nimprovement in vortex prediction, over earlier KBKZ models [11], but the model \nover-predicted shear stress and first normal stress difference in strain hardening melts \n[12]. \n \nMore recent developments of the MSF model have focussed on a convective \nconstraint release (CCR) mechanism, as first introduced by Marrucci [13]. This model \nuses a differential equation for tube stretch, originating from an energy-balance \nanalysis, and employs two adjustable parameters. The model has been demonstrated \nto fit not only elongational data, but also shear stress and first and second normal \nstress difference for strain hardening melts. This model is the focus of this work, and \nis detailed in section 2. \n \nMolecular considerations have figured strongly in other recent developments in \nrheological modelling - including the time-integral Pom-Pom model [14,15,16], the \nDouble Convection Reptation model (DCR) (with both time-integral and differential \nforms) [17, 18, 19], and in differential models [20, 21]. Simulation of time-integral \nviscoelastic flows with particle tracking has been advanced by the work of Dupont \nand Crochet [3], Tanner [22,4] and Mitsoulis [23,24]. Techniques for tracking, \nsolution, and tensor computation have been further developed [5, 11, 25]. A purely \nEulerian approach, whereby the deformation fields are convected was introduced by \nPeters et. al [26], giving time-dependant two dimensional solutions. Rasmussen \nintroduced a Lagrangian mesh method suitable for three dimensional time-dependant \nviscoelastic flows, including a Rivlin-Sawyers model [27], and a modified MSF with \nconvective constraint release which was applied to membrane inflation [28].  \n \nIt has not been shown that a time-integral constitutive model can fit all viscometric \nrheological data for IUPAC LDPE, and also match the vortex opening angle data in a \n5.75:1 axisymmetric contraction flow measured by experiment by White and Kondo \n[29]. Concurring with such experimental data is an important requirement for a \nconstitutive model, since it tests a model\u2019s response in a non-viscometric flow, \ncontaining a mixture of elongation and shear. This problem is studied in this work, \nand leads to a suggested modification to the convective constraint release mechanism \n  2that further isolates elongational stretch from dissipation by shear. The resulting MSF \nmodel is shown to match the viscometric rheological data, and agree much more \nclosely with the contraction flow experimental data. \n \n2. The Molecular Stress Function model \n \nThe Molecular Stress Function model (MSF) gives the extra-stress in a flow,  , \naccording to the time-integral model: \n() t \u03c4\n \n    ,      ( 1 )   () ( ) ( ) ' ' , ' , dt t t t t m t\nt\n\u222b \u221e \u2212 = MSF S \u03c4\n \nwhere   is a memory function between time t in the past, and the current time t, \nand S  is the strain measure between times t  and t. This strain measure can be \nwritten as: \n(' ,t t m\n(' ,t t MSF\n)\n)\n)\n)\n'\n'\n \n  ,        ( 2 )   () () (' , ' , ' ,\n2 t t t t f t t DE MSF S S =\n \nwhereS  is the Doi-Edwards strain tensor [9, 10], and  (' ,t t DE ( ) ' ,t t f  represents the \nratio of tube diameters  a a0 , where a is the tube diameter at time t, and a0 is the tube \ndiameter of the unstretched segments that were created at time  ' t . \n \nConsiderable progress was made by defining  ( ) ' ,\n2 t t f  as a function of the average \nvalue of the logarithm of the deformed tube segment lengths,  ' lnu , as defined in \nreference [10]. The strain energy of the  system, W  is proportional to  ; \nintroduction of a maximum value for stored energy, and thus stretch, led to a fit-\nfunction for   in terms of  only\nMSF 1\n2 \u2212 f\n(' ,\n2 t t f ) ' lnu  and a single parameter. The model was \nshown capable of fitting a wide range of transient and steady state measurements in \nelongational flows for a range of polymer melts [9, 10]. An additional attraction is \nthat simulations with this model can be performed using the computationally efficient \n\u201cbackwards integration\u201d method employed for KBKZ type models  [11]. Despite the \nquantitative accuracy for elongational flows, there remained a degree of over-\nprediction of shear stress and first normal stress difference in shear flow [12].  \n \nPhysical consideration of the rate of storage of energy, and the rate of dissipation of \nenergy lead to an evolution equation for  of the form: \n2 f\n \n  \uf8f7 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n=\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212 CR\nf\nf\nt\nf\nf 1\n1\n1\n2\n4\n1\n2 2\nS : k \u03b2\n\u03b2\n,       ( 3 )  \n \nwhere k is the velocity gradient tensor, S is the orientation tensor (where S = 1\/5 SDE). \nThe parameter \u03b2 is equal to unity for linear melts, and (normally) equal to 2 for strain \nhardening melts [12, 30, 31]. The term CR is a form of the convective constraint \nrelease mechanism suggested by Marrucci [13]. \n \n  32.1 Convective constraint release in the Molecular stress function. \n \nThe form of  the convective constraint release mechanism, CR, was established in ref. \n[12] as: \n  () ( p q q , , g f CR\n2 2 1 \u2212 = ) ,        ( 4 )  \nwhere  q q, and  pare the unit vector  normal to tube cross-section, its affine time \nderivative, and the affine time-derivative of a unit vector tangential to a tube, \nrespectively [12]. It was shown that q and p are always coaxial in non-rotational \nflow, and always perpendicular in shear flow. This led to  ( ) p q q , , g  being expressed in \nterms of two dissipative functions  ( ) p q q , , g1 , and  ( ) p q q , , g2  which respond very \ndifferently to rotational and irrotational flows.  \n \nThe linear addition of these two functions has been used by Wagner as the \u201csimplest\u201d \ncontinuation, giving a constraint release mechanism with two parameters, a1 and a2 : \n \n  () () ( [ p q q p q q , , g a , , g a f CR 2 2 1 1\n2 2 1\n2\n1\n+ \u2212 = ) ]     (5) \n  \nFor flows involving changes in deformation rate, these two functions  can be \nexpressed objectively in terms of  the orientation tensor, S, and the Rivlin-Ericksen  \ntensors , A1  and A2 [12]: \n \n  () ( ) 11\n1\n,\n2\ng, , g ==\n2\n11 qqp SA A :S,         ( 6 )  \nand   () ( ) 22\n1\n,,\n2\ng, , g == \u2212\n2\n12 2 1 qqp SA A A :S A :S.    (7) \n \nThe two Rivlin-Ericksen tensors are given by \n \n  ,          ( 8 )  \n2 2\n1 D A 4 =\nand  (\nT 2\n1\n1\n2 W D D W A\nA\nA \u22c5 + \u22c5 + + = 2\nDt\nD ) ,       ( 9 )  \n \nwhere W  and D are the rate of rotation tensor, and rate of deformation tensor \nrespectively, given by: \n \n  (\nT k k W \u2212 =\n2\n1 ) ,           ( 1 0 )  \nand   (\nT k k + =\n2\n1 )\n)\nD .           ( 1 1 )  \n \nThe function   is significant in elongational flows, whereas  is \nsignificant in rotational flow. Crucially, \n( 1 , g 1 SA () 2 ,, g 12 SA A\n( ) 2 ,, g 12 SA A =0 in constant strain-rate \nextensional flows; this allows CR to distinguish between rotational and irrotational \nflows [12]. \n \n  4The current work assesses the models performance against experimental data for \nLDPE in a 5.75 : 1 axisymmetric contraction flow from White and Kondo. It is noted \nthat in the complex flows encountered in the geometry (\u2018complex\u2019 implying a \ncombination of shear and elongation, that varies along a particles path), the rise in \n is much lower than that given by earlier MSF models (without CCR), and \nachieves both lower stress levels and vortex growth than expected.  We reason that the \nlarge values of   induced by the elongational flow into the contraction suffer heavy \ndissipation from the   term, due to the levels of shear, and rate change, in \nthe flow. Examination of the evolution equation for   shows that the dissipation rate \nof     due to rotational flow is approximately proportional to   at \nlarge  ; this gives a very large rate of dissipation in the contraction since   is \ntypically an order of magnitude higher than values reached in simple shear flow. \n(' ,\n2 t t f\n2 f\nf\n)\n)\n2 f\n( 2 ,, g 12 SA A\n2 f\n()\n4\n2 ,, fg 12 SA A\n2 f\n \nWe propose a method to isolate stored elongational energy from heavy dissipation by \nmodest rotational components; we make the dissipation rate for   relatively \nindependent of the magnitude of  , whilst maintaining the behaviour of the original \nat low values of  , especially the asymptotic nature around  .  \n2 f\nf\nf 1\n2 = f\n \n  () () ( ) 2 2 2\n11 2 4\n,, 1\n1,\n2\ng\nCR f a g a\nf\n\uf8ee\uf8f9\n=\u2212 + \uf8ef\uf8fa\n\uf8f0\uf8fb\n12\n1\nSA A\nSA     (12) \n \nThe method does not change the behaviour in constant rate elongational flow, since \nfunction  is then zero. In the remainder of this work, we refer to the evolution \nequation, Eq.3, with the original linear combination of functions   and   given in \nEq.5 as \u2018model CR1\u2019, and with the weighted combination expressed in Eq.12 as \n\u2018model CR2\u2019. \n2 g\n1 g 2 g\n \n2.2 Comparison with rheometric data \n \nWe assess the models against flows of the IUPAC LDPE melt. This is because the \nmelt is particularly well characterised with memory function data, and sufficient \ntransient and steady-state rheometric data to give a \u201cbest fit\u201d, with enough data for \nindependent cross-comparison between transient and steady-state predictions. \nExperimental results are available for an abrupt 5.75:1 contraction ratio die, allowing \ndirect comparison with simulation. Throughout this work, we assume that the memory \nfunction in Eq.1 can be approximated by the well known sum of exponentials: \n \n() () \u2211 \uf8f7 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb \u2212\n\u2212 =\ni i i\ni t t g\nt t m\n\u03bb \u03bb\n'\nexp ' , .         ( 1 3 )  \n \nWe use the relaxation times, \u03bbi , and relaxation moduli, gi , data from Laun [32, 33]. \nThe relaxation times and moduli at the different temperatures relevant to IUPAC \nLDPE data are tabulated in ref. [11]. A value of \u03b2 =2 was appropriate for the strain-\nhardening rate of the material, this value is used throughout this work. \n \n  5Figure 1 shows the response of   from models CR1 and CR2 in elongational and \nshear flow. Values of a  w e r e  o b t a i n e d  f r o m  b e s t  f i t to the transient planar and \nuniaxial elongation data at 125\u00b0C from Laun and Schuch [34], then values of a  were \nobtained by fitting to the steady state shear data from Meissner [35]. Both models use \nthe same value of   (a ), but different values of a  (a for model \nCR1, and  for model CR2).  \n2 f\n1\n1\n2\n1 a 012 . 0 = 2 07 . 0 2 =\n55 . 0 2 = a\n \nAs shown in [12],  rises to a plateau in elongational flow with model CR1, whereas \nin shear flow it rises to a peak (a few units high) and then reduces back to unity; \nelongational behaviour is identical using model CR2 (since  ). Qualitative \nbehaviour in shear is the same with a peak followed by a reduction to unity. The peak \nis seen to be shifted to a slightly higher strain (due to the greater dissipation at low \n), this peak is followed by a sharper fall. \n2 f\n0 2 = g\n2 f\n \nWe note first that model CR1 gives an excellent fit to the key IUPAC rheometric data \nusing a1 =0.012, and a2 =0.07 : data for steady-state shear, steady-state first normal \nstress difference, transient planar elongation, transient uniaxial elongation and \ntransient shear are all fitted simultaneously by this one model. This is clearly a very \nsignificant advance over previous models, including the MSF without CCR (which \nover predicted stresses in shear [12]), and the \u2018adapted KBKZ\u2019 model [5] (which \nadditionally gives a slower rise rate than transient elongational data). \n \nWe demonstrate the (equally accurate) viscometric response of the variation \u2018model \nCR2\u2019 in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2 compares the fit of models CR1 and CR2 in \ncomparison to the transient elongational and shear data from Laun and Schuch at \n125\u00b0C [34]. Both planar and uniaxial elongational data are well fitted, and the rate, \nslight overshoot, and large strain asymptote of shear viscosity are closely matched by \nboth models. The fit to the transient shear data is effectively a prediction of the \nmodels from choosing their respective values of a2 to fit Meissner\u2019s steady-state shear \ndata at 150\u00b0C. \n \nFigure 3 compares steady-state shear predictions of model CR1 and CR2 with \nMeissner\u2019s data [35]. For completeness predictions for steady-state elongational \nviscosity are compared with uniaxial measurements reported in ref. [33]. Using  a2 = \n0.07 for CR1, and a2 = 0.55 for CR2, both models give an excellent fit to both shear \nstresses and first normal stress difference, without a tendency for over-prediction. \n \n3. Time-integral simulation method \n \nFrom a computational point of view, the \u2018MSF with CCR\u2019 model differs greatly from \nMSF models without CCR, and \u2018traditional\u2019 KBKZ models. The single greatest \ndifference is that the stress integration cannot be performed monotonically as one \ntracks a particle backwards in time. The reason for this is that to find the stress \ncontribution from a time t  in the past, one must know not only the Doi-Edwards \ntensor between times  ' t  and the current time, t, but also the relative stretch between \ntimes   and t, \n'\n' t ( ) ' ,\n2 t t f . This involves starting with an isotropic distribution for S at \ntime  ' and  =1 (i.e.  ), and integrating   forwards in time through all  t\n2 f () 1 ' ,\n2 = t f ' t\n2 f\n  6times  ', where  ' t t ' ' ' \u2264 \u2264 t t\nS\n. It is perhaps of value to state that the terms S and  , as \nthey appear in Eq.3, are   and \n2 f\n( t t \u2032 \u2032 \u2032, ) ( ) t t f \u2032 \u2032 \u2032,\n2 , respectively. \n)\n()( , ' t t F k = ) ' t\nd\n( ) ' ,t t\n( ) ' ,t t F () 0.05 F\n1 F\n\u2212 k\n \n3.1 Overview of the solution method \n \nThe simulation uses nine-noded bi-quadratic elements to represent velocity \ncomponents, with one order lower interpolation used for pressure. An initial Stokes\u2019 \nflow solution is computed to start the iterative process. The viscoelastic stress \nresulting from the flow solution of the previous iteration is computed for each Gauss \npoint in each element; to obtain the stress for a particle at a Gauss point it is necessary \nto know the history of that particle. The flow kinematics are used to track a particle \n\u2018backwards\u2019 in time, the method used for tracking is given in detail in ref [11]; this \nreference details the streamline tracking method, and the method for locating the \nparticle\u2019s position in an element\u2019s natural coordinate system as the particle is tracked \nback through many elements on its course.  \n \n3.2 History-storage and time-step considerations \n \nThe particle strictly needs to be tracked back to \u201c - \u221e\u201d, in practice this must be \nmoderated \u2013 we use 5 times the longest relaxation time as the target. The velocity \ngradient tensor k is computed by the least-squares method, described in [23], to give a \nsmooth and continuous velocity gradient field. As discussed in [5], the trace of k, \nresulting from an incompressible finite-element flow solution, will not in general be \nzero, thus the \u2018error\u2019 in the trace is \u2018shared\u2019 between the diagonal terms to maintain a \nphysical meaningful deformation gradient tensor. The deformation gradient tensor, \n is computed by solution of  (' ,t t F\n \n  ()\n'\n' ,\ndt\nt t F\n.       ( 1 4 )  \n \nAs detailed in ref. [11], a 4\nth order Runga-Kutta method, with controlled integration \ntime steps was used to compute F ; the combination will be shown (in section \n4.3) to maintain unity determinant until a point that approaches the limit set by \nmachine precision (64-bit). When, along some particle tracks, the deformation \ngradient tensor,   starts to become ill-conditioned (we use ( ) det 1 \u2212>  \nas the test), back tracking is stopped and the final value of  is used for earlier stress \ncontributions; results will be shown insensitive to this (in the case that F is computed \nto a precision which approaches the expected limit with 64-bit computation).  \nF\n \nValues that need to be stored at each time s, where  ' t t s \u2212 = ,  are: s,  ,  , \nand integration weights arising from the time-integration scheme to be used.  \n() ' ,t t () ' t\n \nTime stepping considerations are slightly more involved than with KBKZ type \nmodels. As with KBKZ-type models, time steps need to be moderated to allow \naccurate integration of the exponential time-constant weights implied by the memory \nfunction approximation (Eq.13), and they also need to be moderated for accurate \ntracking through elements. For the MSF with CCR model, the accurate resolution of \n  7the history of  must be considered independently. Consideration of Eq.3 , and Eqs.5 \nand 12 suggests that significant errors in the resolution of   are likely if there is a \nlarge change in the velocity gradient tensor k, or the orientation tensor S over a single  \ntime-step. To moderate this effect, the current rate of change of k, \n2 f\n2 f\ndt\ndk\nwas estimated \nfrom finite differencing the two latest samples of k. It was ensured that: \n \nk\nk\n10\n1\n\u2264 \u00d7 \u2206\nt d\nd\nt   ,          ( 1 5 )  \nwhere  z , implies the magnitude of a tensor, z ,  given by \nT z : z\n2\n1\n. This additional \nlimitation on the time-step limits changes in the velocity gradient tensor to around \n10% per step to assist resolution. The additional requirement involves significant \nextra computation, but is very effective in picking up regions of high \u2018activity\u2019 in the \ndistant past, and gives much better convergence if included than if omitted. We \nascribe this to the reduced variation due to \u2018chance\u2019 sampling as particles flow past \nlocalised regions of high deformation rate, such as particles in both the main flow and \nthe vortex that flow past the \u2018lip\u2019. \n \n3.3 Stress computation \nTo perform the stress integration in Eq.1 it is necessary to know the stretch between \nany time in the past,  ', and the current time,  . To do this   must be computed \nforwards in time according to Eq.3, starting at value 1 at time  t  ( )  to \narrive at the relative stretch  . To achieve this the orientation tensor relative to \ntime  ,  , must be determined for all intermediate times, ' t , where t ; \nstarting with an isotropic distribution at time  ', and ending with  .  The \nintegration of   moves thorough all intermediate times. For these computations it is \nappropriate to denote the stored values of (inverted) deformation gradient tensor and \nvelocity gradient tensor that lie between times t  and t as \nt t\n2\n()\n2\n()\n2\n' t () ' , ' ' t t S ' t \u2265\nt\n2\nf\n'\n' 1 ' , ' = t t f\n' ' t \u2265\n() ' ,t t S\n' ,t t f\nf\n' ( ) ' ' ,t t\n1 \u2212\n)\nF , and  .

( ) ' , ' ' t t F  can then be used to calculate the \nrelative orientation tensor between  ' t  and  ',  ' t ( ) ' , ' ' t t S  [12]. This can be done by direct \nspherical integration, as in ref. [11], or to a close approximation by calculating the \nCauchy tensor,  , the Finger strain tensor,  F F C\nT = ( )\n1 \u2212 FF\nf\nT\n2\n-1 , and then using Currie\u2019s \napproximation [36]. In view of the very large number of times that the relative \norientation tensor S must be calculated to compute , and its significant \n  8computational cost when done by numerical integration, we use Currie\u2019s \napproximation throughout in simulations. \nWith  , k , and time s available at all storage points, the rate of rotation, and \nrate of deformation tensors  , and \n() ' , ' ' t t S () ' ' t\n() ' ' t W ( ) ' ' t D  can be deduced using Eqs.10 and 11, \nand the rate of change of the Rivlin-Eriksen tensor  t d 1 A d can be calculated. We \ncompute the time derivative of   by finite-differencing in time between the value of \nA1 at time  'and the value of A1 at previous point backtracked to (i.e. at  ). This \ngives a value for the derivative that is a representative average between these two \ntimes, this is consistent with the forward integration used to calculate . It will be \nappreciated that (much) repeated computation can be saved by storing these three \nderived tensors whilst tracking the particles history. \n1 A\nt ' ' t t \u2206 +\n2 f\nThe dissipation functions   and  can now be computed from Eqs.6-9, and Eq.3 can \nbe integrated over any time t , allowing \n1 g 2 g\n' ' ' ,t t f  to be calculated. We employ an \nadaptive fourth order Runga-Kutta method to integrate Eq.3.  \n( )\n2\n)\n()\n2\n'\n()\n2\n3.3.2 Adaptive computation point selection \nThe direct computation of   for every point indicated by the time-stepping \ncriteria can be prohibitively slow. We use an adaptive method whereby   is \ncomputed for a number of values of t , with linear interpolation  over the interval \nbetween these values; it is first checked (by a computationally inexpensive method) \nthat linear interpolation is accurate over an interval; if not then a new point is \ncalculated between them by direct integration of Eq.3. This continues (recursively) \nuntil all intervals have been verified. \n(' ,\n2 t t f\n' ,t t f\nThe process begins by selecting a number of values of  ' t  for direct computation of \n. We select values closest to each the time constants,  ' ,t t f i \u03bb , in the memory \nfunction, and also the values closest to  i , and  i \u03bb  to give an approximately \neven spread in a logarithmic sense  (assuming there is a factor of 10 between adjacent \ni \u03bb ). The points representing the largest value of s recorded during \u2018backtracking\u2019, and \nthe point representing   must also be selected to give full coverage for \ninterpolation. For the memory function data used, with 8 relaxation times from ~10\n-4 \nto ~10\n3 this gives an initial spread of around 25 \u2018seed\u2019 points, t0, t1, t2, t3, .. as shown \nin Figure 4. \n\u03bb \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5\nt t = '\n()\n2 ()\n2\nTo make checking computationally inexpensive, the adaptive method checks the \ninterpolation across an interval by evaluating linear interpolation across two intervals; \nthis interpolation can be compared with the point in between that has already been \ncomputed by direct integration. Initially the interval between t0 and t1 is checked: the \nvalues of   and   are used in linear interpolation to give an estimated \nvalue of  , which we write as \n0 ,t t f\n() 1\n2 ,t t f\n2 ,t t f\n1 ,t t f . If it is found that:  ( )\n2 \u02c6\n  () ()\u03b5 \u2264 \u2212 1\n2\n1\n2 , , \u02c6 t t f t t f ,       ( 1 7 )  \n  9where \u03b5  is the permitted error, then the interval t0 to t1 is deemed resolved by linear \ninterpolation, and checking proceeds to the next interval (t1 to t2). If the criterion is not \nmet, then a new point, t1a is deemed necessary between t0 and t1; the nearest storage \npoint to the mid-point is used. The value of  a t t f 1 , is then calculated by direct \nintegration, and the checking proceeds to checking the interval between t0 and t1a. \nThis continues recursively until all intervals between direct integration points have \nbeen verified. \n( )\n2\nThe final interpolation is, of course, performed using adjacent values. For the \ncontraction flows studied, a value of 0.05 for \u03b5  was found to give insignificant \ndifference in computed stresses, compared with stresses computed using every point. \nThis strategy of checking by interpolation across two existing intervals avoids \nadditional (expensive) direct computations of  , unless shown necessary. The \nefficiency of the adaptive method is suggested by the variation in the number of \npoints added in simulation. In contraction flow, the method typically adds an average \nof around 100 direct integration points; many fewer (~10-40) for particles wholly in \nthe \u2018quiet\u2019 upstream region, and many more (~300-3000) for particles passing the lip, \nor in the vortex. The adaptive method reduces our overall simulation time by a factor \nof over 20, compared with direct integration at every point. \n2 f\n \n3.3.3 Stress integration \nWith the value of   available at each stored point (by linear interpolation unless \ndirectly computed), there remains only the computation of  . This is \nstraightforward as   is stored for all points, and Currie\u2019s approximation can be \nused as outlined in section 3.3.1. The time-integration of Eq.1 may then be performed \nusing the Gauss-Legendre derived weights that were stored during \u2018backtracking\u2019. \n(' ,\n2 t t f\n(' ,t t\n1 F\n\u2212\n)\n)\n)\n(' ,t t DE S\n \n3.4 Updating the flow fields \nThe velocity and pressure field update scheme we use is based upon that of \nViriyayuthakon and Caswell [37]. The method we use here contains a small, but \nvaluable, modification to the method detailed in ref [5]. For context, we summarise \nthe method given in [5]. \n \nFor an assumed steady-state flow, with negligible inertia and body-forces, we require: \n \n  ,         ( 1 8 )   () 0 = \u2212 \u22c5 \u2207 p I \u03c4v\n \nwhere   are the viscoelastic extra-stresses computed using Eq.1, and p is pressure. \nWe add notional Newtonian stresses, \nv \u03c4\n( )\nT k k + \u00b5  to each side of the equation, and \nrearrange to give: \n \n  ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) [ ]N N p\nT\nv\nT k k \u03c4 I k k + \u2212 \u22c5 \u2207 = \u2212 + \u22c5 \u2207 \u2212 + \u00b5 \u00b5 1   ,    (19) \n \nwhere the subscripts imply that the viscoelastic and Newtonian stresses from iteration \nN, are used to give a body force for the N+1\nth flow solution. The iterative procedure \nbegins with an initial Newtonian flow solution, and proceeds until convergence is \nattained.  The value of \u00b5 that is used is important, we use  0 \u00b5 \u03c9 \u00b5 = , where  0 \u00b5 is the \n  10numerically predicted value of low shear viscosity, given by  \u2211 = i i g \u03bb \u00b50 , and \u03c9  is a \nscalar. Viscoelastic stresses can be much higher than notional Newtonian stresses \ngiven by the low shear viscosity, due to strain hardening and stress convection. If \u03c9  \nis too small, the resistance to change in the velocity field is insufficient (as the \nnotional Newtonian stresses are too small compared with the viscoelastic stresses), \nand the possibility of good convergence is lost. If \u03c9  is too high, the rate of \nconvergence is reduced, also the final level of convergence that is achieved is reduced \n(when the direct damping effect of \u03c9  on velocity is accounted for in the convergence \nmeasure). \n\u03c9\n)]k\nT \u03c4 \u22c5 \u2207\n< r\n\u00d7\n \n Previously we have chosen a suitable value of \u03c9  for a flow-rate, and proceeded with \none solution of Eq. 19 per stress computation; values of   of up to 60 were needed at \nthe highest flow rates for good convergence, and convergence can be very slow. A \nmore efficient method is to use m sub-iterations of the flow solution method via: \n \n  ( ) ( ) [ ] [ ] ( [ N k p v\nT k k I k k + \u22c5 \u2207 \u2212 = \u2212 + \u22c5 \u2207 \u2212 + \u00b5 \u00b5 1   (20) \n \nwhere the subscripts imply that sub-iteration k gives the notional Newtonian stresses \nthat are used to calculate the k+1\nth sub-iteration flow solution. Initially m is set equal \nto\u03c9 . The number of sub-iterations is maintained at m for a number of viscoelastic \nstress iterations until it is detected that further useful progress has ceased (see later); at \nthis point m is halved (to nearest integer). These stepped decrements continue until m \n= 1.  \n \nThe advantage of the procedure is much faster convergence rate. This appears to \nhappen by allowing features which are usually slow to reach convergence (e.g. \ncorrection pressure) to progress quickly towards their approximate final values when \nm is large. More sensitive features such as vortex angle tend to oscillate (greatly) \nduring this phase. As m falls, the oscillations in the more sensitive features fall to fine \ndetail level. Oscillations in the \u2018outputs\u2019: vortex intensity, vortex angle, correction \npressure, and vortex area were monitored by the code. The time to halve m was taken \nto be when each of these outputs had arrived at a value that had been \u2018crossed\u2019 three \ntimes during that value of m (indicating oscillation about the solution point). In most \ninstances, the \u2018outputs\u2019 listed had settled to four significant figures in the simulations \nreported. \n \n  A minimum convergence of   was obtained for all MSF with CCR \nsimulations in  this work (where Vr is the maximum change in any velocity \ncomponent over a full viscoelastic stress iteration, N to N+1, (explicitly not over a \nsub-iteration) divided by the maximum flow velocity). Similarly the relative change in \npressure was always better than4 . Both of these convergence figures are \nsignificantly better than those obtained for the earlier fit-function MSF model [10] (by \nfactors of 5 for velocity, and 20 for pressure). These comparisons have been checked \nusing the same mesh, material, flow-rates, software, and time-stepping criteria and \nindicate that it is the MSF with CCR model that is giving better convergence. The \nmost obvious differences in prediction between the MSF with CCR model and the \nearlier fit-function MSF model is that the earlier model gives high shear viscosity and \n4 10 2\n\u2212 \u00d7 V \u03c9\n4 10\n\u2212\n  11first normal stress difference, N1. This suggests that the lower shear predictions, given \nby the MSF with CCR, are resulting in improved convergence behaviour. \n \n4. Simulation procedure \n \nThe MSF model with CCR was applied to a 5.75:1 axisymmetric contraction flow, \nand a 8:1 planar contraction flow. Experimental data for vortex opening angle is \navailable for the former geometry [29]. Both the original constraint release \nformulation, \u2018MSF model CR1\u2019, and the modified formulation, \u2018MSF model CR2\u2019 \nwere applied to the flows, along with the earlier fit-function MSF model [10], which \nwe refer to as \u2018MSF without CCR\u2019, for comparison. Simulations were performed \nusing relaxation data for 160\u00b0C; solutions were obtained at apparent shear rates of \n0.125 s\n-1, 0.25s\n-1, 0.5s\n-1 ,  ... continuing in factors of two whilst convergence was \nsatisfactory.  A convergence value of   was required for the \u2018MSF \nwithout CCR\u2019 model; the convergence of the CCR models was found to be \nsignificantly better allowing the tighter requirement:  . \n3 10 1\n\u2212 \u00d7 < r V \u03c9\nV \u03c9\n4 10 2\n\u2212 \u00d7 < r\n \n4.1 Application to 5.75:1 axisymmetric contraction flow \n \nThe models were used with rheological data and parameters for IUPAC LDPE at \n160\u00b0C. White and Kondo made measurements for several brands of LDPE (including \nIUPAC) at several temperatures, and showed that all of these results formed a single \ncurve, when plotted against the fully-developed downstream wall Stress Ratio. This \nratio, Sr, is given by : \n \nw\nN\nSr\n\u03c4 2\n1\n=   ,          ( 2 1 )  \n \nwhere N1 is the first normal stress difference at the wall, and  w \u03c4 is the shear stress at \nthe wall. \n \nThe experimental results of White and Kondo are compared with the three models in \nFigure 5. MSF model CR2 is seen to show a strong rise in opening angle with Sr, and \nwhilst there remains a difference in rise-rate, the strong growth is similar to the \nexperimental data. The largest opening angle obtained is 51 degrees at a value of Sr of \n2.3. MSF model CR1 falls well below the experimental data giving a peak of 32 \ndegrees at Sr = 1.9. The fit-function MSF model, \u2018MSF without CCR\u2019, is notably \n\u2018late\u2019 when represented in this way. A peak of 44 degrees is obtained, but at Sr = 10.7. \nThe \u2018lateness\u2019 may be attributed to the over-prediction of N1 in shear by this model, \nwhich gives over-prediction of Sr at a given wall shear rate. MSF model CR2 clearly \ngives the best quantitative and qualitative behaviour against this experimental data. \n \nFor interest, the vortex intensity given by the models is shown in Figure 6. The vortex \nintensity is defined as the ratio of the volumetric flow rate in the vortex, to the \nvolumetric flow rate passing through the die.  All three models show a peak at an \napparent shear rate of around 10s\n-1, with CR2 giving a much stronger vortex than \nCR1. The \u2018MSF without CCR\u2019 is seen to be more similar to model CR2 when plotted \nagainst apparent shear rate. Figure 7 shows the contours of streamfunction for the \nthree models at an apparent shear rate of 32s\n-1 (a rate at which model CR2 is very \nclose to the experimental data). The contours in the vortexes are plotted at integer \n  12multiples of 1% vortex intensity and show the generally stronger vortex behaviour of \nmodel CR2. \n \nFigure 8 plots the entrance correction pressure for the three models. Model CR2 gives \nhigher correction pressure than model CR1 as the flow rate rises, as might reasonably \nbe expected as (as will be shown directly) it gives greater strain-hardening in \u2018mixed\u2019 \nelongational flow. Both curves are higher than that of the MSF without CCR model. \n \n4.2 Application to 8:1 planar contraction flow \n \nExperimentally, pronounced vortex growth with increasing flow rate is well \nestablished for planar contraction flows of LDPE, for example ref. [38] shows \nopening angles in excess of 50\u00b0 at high flow rates. Figure 9 shows the opening angles \nobtained by simulation. Model CR1 rises to a peak of 34 degrees at an apparent shear \nrate of 256 s\n-1, whereas model CR2 rise more strongly to a highest value of 47 degrees \nat the same rate. The \u2018MSF without CCR\u2019 model approximately follows the line of \nmodel CR2,  until an apparent shear rate of 64s\n-1, after which satisfactory convergence \nwasn\u2019t obtained. Figure 10 shows the contours of streamfunction for the three models \nat an apparent shear rate of 32 s\n-1. Contours in the vortexes are plotted at integer \nmultiples of 0.2% for these flows. Model CR2  gives the strongest vortex, but perhaps \nmore significantly, it is the only model giving the pronounced vortex \u2018bulge\u2019 found  in \nexperimental visualisation experiments (see ref. [38]). The evolution of the vortex, \nwith growing flow rate, can be seen in figure 11. \n \nFigure 12 Shows the vortex intensity obtained using the three models. These follow a \nsimilar pattern to their axisymmetric counterparts, with increasing intensity obtained \nin the order CR1, \u2018MSF without CCR\u2019, and CR2. The peaks are lower, at 1.6% for \nCR2, and are at approximately four times the apparent shear rate compared with the \n5.75:1 axisymmetric contraction. This suggests they occur at comparable levels of \nelongation rate in both geometries. Figure 13 gives the correction pressures for the \nflow. Again models CR1 and CR2 follow a similar path, with CR2 rising more steeply \nat high rates, as can be expected from the greater strain-hardening. \n \nAn important effect on stress of the three models is illustrated by Figure 14. This \nshows contours of the Principal Stress Difference (PSD) for the 8:1 planar contraction \nflow at an apparent shear rate of 32s\n-1. Comparing models CR1 and CR2 reveals \nclearly higher stress levels (~30%) from CR2, despite their constant rate viscometric \nresponses being difficult to separate. This demonstrates the effectiveness of model \nCR2 in isolating large values of , that are induced by elongational flow, from heavy \ndissipation by rotational flow. Detailed examination of the centre-line stresses reveals \nthem to differ by only a few percent. The flow along this line is irrotational, but it is \nnot constant rate; as the rate changes then \n2 f\nt d A d  is non-zero, and thus \n is non-zero \u2013 giving a slight difference between CR1 and CR2 in this \nregion. The \u2018MSF without CCR\u2019 model gives qualitatively different behaviour with \ngreatly increased PSD near the downstream wall; the over-prediction of shear-stress \nand N1 with the model seems the clear explanation. \n( 2 ,, g 12 SA A)\n \n  134.3 Effects of finite precision computation of the deformation gradient tensor  \n \nIn the flows studied (characterised by an abrupt \u2018lip\u2019, high apparent shear rates, and a \nlongest time constant of 701 seconds), very large deformations need to be represented \nby the deformation gradient tensor, F. In Appendix 1, we deduce a condition number, \nC, which gives the expected error in the determinant of F due to representing the \ncomponents of F to finite precision. The expected error is shown in Appendix 1 to be \nof the order of \n  N\nC\n10\n,           ( 2 2 )  \nwhere \n  ( \u03b8\u03b8 \u03b8\u03b8 F F F F F F C xr rx xx rr + =\n2\n1 )       ( 2 3 )    \n \n(for axisymmetric flow), and N is the number of decimal digits used in the \ncomputations. The current simulations were performed using 64-bit precision giving \napproximately 16 significant decimal figures, i.e. N\u224816. From Eq. 22, the expected \nerror in the determinant (due to rounding) is of order 1 for a condition number of 10\n16. \nFor a condition number of 10\n14, an error in the determinant of order 10\n-2 is expected; \nthis is the order of error in the determinant (5\u00d710\n-2) that is \u2018trapped\u2019 by the software \nand causes it to discontinue back-tracking for that particle. Discontinuing \nbacktracking at a point is equivalent to neglecting the strain history of the particle that \noccurred  before that point. The current simulation uses a high order integration \nscheme for the computation of F in conjunction with controlled integration time steps; \nalso the trace of k is enforced to zero. Condition numbers of F were monitored in \ndetail over a full-field stress computation for a particular flow (model CR2 in the \n5.75:1 axisymmetric abrupt contraction flow, at an apparent shear rate of 64 s\n-1); the \nminimum condition numbers when the situation  ( ) 05 . 0 1 det > \u2212 F\n1 10\n+ n\nwas encountered \nwere ~10\n13 , with a maximum observed of  ~10\n14 . Approximately equal numbers \noccurred in each \u2018decade\u2019 (in this section the notation \u201c~10\nn \u201d is used to imply \nnumbers greater or equal to 1 , but less than 1 ). Since an error of order 10\n-2  \nis expected in the determinant of F at a condition number of 10\n14, the accuracy of the \ncomputation of F in the simulations is seen to approach the expected limit for 64-bit \nrepresentation. \nn 10 \u00d7 \u00d7\n \nSome numerical experiments were performed to investigate the sensitivity of results \nto the precision of representation of F, and its method of computation. \n \nIn the first experiment, the maximum time-step permitted for a single application of \nthe Runga-Kutta integration of  F ( I t \u2206 ) was reduced to  max 15 0 I tg \u2206 \u2264 , where  is \nthe largest eigenvalue of the velocity gradient tensor, k (the \u201cstandard\u201d time-step was \nmax g\nmax 15 I tg \u2206\u2264 ). This change gave no clear change in the range of condition numbers \nachieved when  ( ) 05 . 0 1 det > \u2212 F was encountered (minimum C of ~10\n13 , maximum C \nof ~10\n14 , with approximately equal numbers in each decade). \n   \nIn the second experiment, F was computed using the \u201cstandard\u201d time-step, but a \nmethod was applied to \u2018force\u2019 F to have unity determinant after each time step \n(detailed in Appendix 2), for as long as available precision permitted. This method \n  14increased the range slightly, with the minimum C of ~10\n14 , and a maximum C of \n~10\n15 ; the majority occurred at ~10\n14 . \n \nIn the third experiment, F was computed to 32-bit precision representation (to be \nprecise  F was computed using the 64-bit method, but after each time-step the \ncomponents of F were reduced to 32-bit precision). On the machine used for \nsimulation, 32-bit precision gives approximately 7 significant decimal figures \n( ). With this method the minimum value that the condition numbers reached \nwhen \n7 N \u2248\n() 05 . 0 1 det > \u2212 F was ~10\n4, with a maximum of ~10\n5  ; again these are consistent \nwith the predictions of Eq. 22. \n \nThe results for vortex intensity, opening angle, and correction pressure from the \nexperiments are summarised in Table 1. Opening angles are the \u2018automated\u2019 opening \nangles detailed in ref. [5], these are slightly below the true (tangential) opening angles \n(by approximately 1\/2 degree at 64s\n-1), but are measured by the software to high \nprecision to show any variation.  \n \nThe results demonstrate considerable robustness, with negligible variation to the \ngraphical scales of Figures 5, 6, and 8. With 32-bit precision, the computation of F \nwas discontinued at values of C of only ~10\n4 to ~10\n5, even with this drop in precision, \nthe results vary very little (the levels of convergence that were obtained were reduced \nby a factor of over 2, a major contributor is likely to be \u2018chance\u2019 variation in how \nmuch history was measured for a particle, from iteration to iteration). Even with 32-\nbit precision representation, only those particles originating near the downstream wall, \nor in the vortex, were affected.  \n \nA likely reason for the insensitivity of results comes from consideration of the \nrelationship between time, and stress contributions from the different time constants \nused to represent the memory function. Luo and Tanner [22] demonstrated that \ndifferent time constants contribute most strongly to the overall stress at different \ndeformation rates (an approximate inverse relationship is notable between the \ndeformation rate and the \u2018dominant\u2019 time constants). Figure 15 shows how different \ntime constants contribute to the total uniaxial elongational viscosity at different \nelongational rates (for model CR2 at the simulation temperature of 160\u00b0C). The \ndeformation rates in contraction flow with an apparent shear rate of 64s\n-1 can be \nexpected to be predominantly in the range 10\n0 to 10\n2 s\n-1; from Figure 15 the greatest \ncontributions to stress in this deformation rate range come from the time constants of  \n7.01\u00d710\n-2  s, 7.01\u00d710\n-1  s, and 7.01\u00d710\n0  s. With 64-bit precision computation, the \ntracking time  had normally exceeded 1000 seconds if the determinant limit was \nreached (with \u2018standard\u2019 integration); this time represents many multiples of the \n\u2018dominant\u2019 time constants, and is sufficient for accurate computation of stress \ncontributions from all time constants up to 70.1 seconds. With 32-bit precision, the \ncomparable figure for tracking time was around 100 seconds, which is sufficient to \nintegrate all of the \u2018dominant\u2019 time constants accurately, with significant error \nexpected in only the two longest time constants (the contributions from these time \nconstants can be seen to be much lower than contributions from the dominant time \nconstants at the characteristic deformation rates). This explains why the results \nobtained using 64-bit precision are very insensitive to the changes in the method used \nto compute F \u2013 all stress was well \u2018resolved\u2019, except for the stress due to the longest \n  15time constant of 701 s, and this time constant is seen to contribute a very small \nfraction of overall stress for deformations around 10\n0 to 10\n2 s\n-1. With 32-bit \ncomputation all time constants except the longest two are well-resolved; however \nthese two time constants contribute very much less than the \u2018dominant\u2019 time constants \n(at the characteristic deformation rates of the flow), and the main features of the flow \nare captured with good accuracy, although with reduced convergence. \n \n5. Discussion and Conclusions \n \nThe Molecular Stress Function Model with Convective Constraint Release is clearly a \nvery significant step in rheological modelling. Within the confines of only two \nadjustable parameters, the steady-state shear viscosity, first normal stress difference, \nand both planar and uniaxial transient elongational data may be fitted for a strain-\nhardening polymer melt. The derivation from energy-balance considerations is based \nupon first principle physics, with a small number of assumptions. The two dissipative \nfunctions  and  effectively isolate rotational and elongational \neffects, and give almost complete independence to the control of energy storage in \npurely elongational or purely shearing flow. \n() 1 g, 1 SA ( 2 ,, g 12 SA A)\n \nUpon application to a complex flow, via a finite element simulation, it was found that \nthe vortex opening angles were lower than expected. The 5.75:1 axisymmetric \ncontraction data from White and Kondo [29], showed clearly larger opening angles. \nThe modification in Eq.12 aims to partially isolate the large values of \n2 f  caused by \nelongational flow, from the rotational content of the flow. As shown, the modification \nfits the experimental opening angle data much better than the original, with an equally \ngood fit to the viscometric data. Application to a planar contraction flow showed that \nthe modification gives much larger peak opening angles for such flows, in keeping \nwith opening angles seen in experiment (e.g. [38]). \n \nIn simulation, the relative orientation tensor  ( ) '', ' tt S  is needed to allow the \nstretch (\n2 ,' ) f tt  to be computed forwards to the current time, t, from each time  , in \nthe past. The method given ensures that computation of the deformation tensor need \nonly be performed once, using Eq.14; relative deformation gradients between any two \nintermediate times can then be computed by a (simple and fast) matrix-multiplication. \nThe relative orientation tensor can be computed from the deformation gradient tensor \neither by direct integration, or by use of Currie\u2019s approximation. Accurate \ncomputation of the stress is significantly more \u2018involved\u2019 than KBKZ-type stresses. \nAs with KBKZ type models, time steps need to be moderated for both accurate \npositional tracking, and accurate integration of the memory-function terms. To \naccurately trace \n' t\n2 f it was found necessary to further moderate time-steps to ensure \nthat the strain-rate history was well-resolved; if this is neglected both accuracy and \nconvergence suffer significantly. The computation of \n2 f is prohibitively expensive if \ncalculated at each stored point. The method described for linear interpolation of \n2 f  \nbetween direct computation points, coupled to the adaptive computation point \nselection method, reduced our solution-time by a factor of over 20.   \n \n  16The linear combination of g,  and  ( 1 1 SA) ( ) 2 ,, g 12 SA A  in the convective constraint \nrelease mechanism was originally chosen as the \u201csimplest ansatz\u201d, a \u2018minimum \nassumption\u2019 continuation that agreed well with experimental results from viscometric \nrheological data. This work shows evidence from comparison of experimental vortex \nopening angle measurements and simulations of complex flows that the linear \ncombination causes reduced opening angles, through interaction between the \nrotational component of flow and the large stretches that are caused principally by \ncontraction (through   ). The modification to the constraint release term, \nshown in Eq.12, reduces this interaction, giving greatly increased opening angles that \nare quantitatively closer to the data of White and Kondo and, at least qualitatively, \ncloser to the large opening angles seen for planar contraction flows. It is of interest \nthat two models that give equally good fits to the available viscometric rheological \ndata, behave significantly differently in a complex flow containing different modes of \ndeformation. The implication for constitutive models is that evaluation against mixed \ndeformation mode flow data is desirable in addition to evaluation against viscometric \nmeasurements.  \n( ,, 12 SA A) 2 g\n \nThe study of the effect of finite precision on computation of the deformation gradient \ntensor, F, produced some interesting results. The method to compute the tensor by \ndirect integration was found to maintain unity determinant until a point approaching \nthat at which rounding errors in 64-bit representation would be expected to make the \ndeterminant alter from unity (judged by a \u2018condition number\u2019); the use of finer \nintegration time-steps gave no clear increase. A method that should (mathematically) \n\u2018force\u2019 the determinant to unity was found to fail, as expected, at only slightly higher \nvalues of the condition number. The results showed considerable insensitivity to \nchanges in the computation method of F, even when the representation precision was \nreduced to 32-bit. Consideration of the dominant time constants in the flow leads to a \nlikely reason for the insensitivity.   \n \n \n \nReferences \n[1] Wagner M.H., A constitutive analysis of uniaxial elongational flow data of low-\ndensity polyethylene melt  , J.Non-Newt.Fluid Mech., 4 (1978), 39. \n[2] A.C.

The following deduces a \ncondition number that gives a measure of the expected error. The particular case \nanalysed is for axisymmetric flow. \n \nConsider a deformation gradient tensor, F, with all components correct to infinite \nprecision, and a unit determinant: \n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n=\n\u03b8\u03b8 F\nF F\nF F\nxx xr\nrx rr\n0 0\n0\n0\nF .    \n \nAs the determinant is unity, then \n   .         () 1 = \u2212 \u03b8\u03b8 F F F F F xr rx xx rr\nConsider now that one of the diagonal terms, (e.g.  ) is rounded up or down due to \nusing  a finite precision of N decimal digits. Taking the case of rounding down,   is \nchanged to   where \nxx F\nxx F\nxx F\u2032 \u2206 \u2212 = \u2032 xx xx F F , and where \nN\nxx F\n10\n~ \u2206 . \nThe new determinant is given by: \n( \u03b8\u03b8 F F F F F xr rx xx rr \u2212 \u2032 )\n)\n.         \n \nSubstituting in the value for   gives a determinant of:  xx F\u2032\n() ( \u03b8\u03b8 F F F F F xr rx xx rr \u2212 \u2206 \u2212 ,        \nwhich is equal to \n  .        () \u03b8\u03b8 \u03b8\u03b8 F F F F F F F rr xr rx xx rr \u2206 \u2212 \u2212\nThe error in the determinant is thus   \u03b8\u03b8 F Frr \u2206 \u2212 , but as  N\nxx F\n10\n~ \u2206  then the error in \nthe determinant is of the order of \nN\nxx rr F F F\n10\n\u03b8\u03b8 .          \nThe same result is found when the rounding of  , or   is considered. Accounting \nfor   and   in a similar manner gives an total expected error in the determinant of \nthe order of  \nrr F \u03b8\u03b8 F\nrx F xr F\n()\nN\nxr rx xx rr F F F F F F\n10\n2\n1\n\u03b8\u03b8 \u03b8\u03b8 +\n,      \nfor calculations with N decimal digits. This suggests a useful \u2018condition number\u2019, C, \nwhere \n( \u03b8\u03b8 \u03b8\u03b8 F F F F F F C xr rx xx rr + =\n2\n1 ) .       \n \nThe corresponding condition number for planar flow is  () 21 12 22 11 2\n1\nF F F F + . \n  21Appendix 2 Method to adjust the deformation gradient tensor, F, to have a \ndeterminant of unity \n  \nThe method to adjust  F to give unity determinant is as follows: \nIf the flow is axisymmetric, then F \u03b8\u03b8 is altered to its analytical value given by \n() () t r t r '\n() ' t r\n  where   is the distance from the centreline at the current time,  , and \n is the distance from the centreline at the earlier time, t  (from ref. [22] ). \nPhysically this should guarantee that \n() rt t\n'\nF \u03b8\u03b8  is greater than zero (it did when tested on \nthe 5.75:1 axisymmetric flow). Having performed this modification, the determinant \nof F, d, is calculated. F is then modified to be a \u2018unity determinant\u2019 deformation \ngradient tensor (  )  using:  \u02c6 F\n   \u02c6 F F \u03b8\u03b8\u03b8 = \u03b8 , \n1\n2 \u02c6\nrr rr FF d = , \n  \n1\n2 \u02c6\nxx xx FF d = ,  \n1\n2 \u02c6\nrx rx FF d = , \n and  \n1\n2 \u02c6\nxr xr FF d = . \n \nThe method alters values in proportion to their existing size; because the direct \nintegration method used to compute  F can maintain an accurate determinant until \nmachine precision is approached, alterations will be very small until high \ndeformation. After this point this method will forcibly maintain unity determinant \n(provided that the determinant has remained positive) until numerical precision is \ninsufficient to represent the deformations with unity determinant. \n \n \n  22List of Figures \n \nFigure 1 Variation of f \n2 using different convective constraint release mechanisms in \nshear and uniaxial elongation.
