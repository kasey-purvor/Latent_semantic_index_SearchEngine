INTRODUCTION\nR ECENT improvements in power density of electromag-netic machines and power conversion electronics have\nallowed electromagnetic systems to encroach into application\nfields that have traditionally been the domain of mechanical\nand hydraulic systems. In these cases, torque production can\nbe considered essentially instantaneous, limited predominantly\nby the bandwidth limitations of feedback sensors, viz. phase\ncurrent transducers, and position transducers such as resolvers\nand optical encoders, etc., with the system dynamics being\ndominated by the (often complex) mechanical drive train. Con-\nsequently, for complex multicomponent mechanical drive trains\nincorporating many nonstiff interconnecting shafts and elastic\ncouplings, impulsive transient torque output from the servo\ndrive can excite mechanical torsional resonances, ultimately\nleading to controller instability [1]. Moreover, the dominant\nfundamental resonant frequency for many such systems is\ntypically < 300 Hz, which often overlaps with the closed-\nloop dynamic bandwidth imposed by the servo-drive control\nalgorithm, with other higher resonant modes usually remaining\nrelatively unexcited, thereby allowing a large proportion of\nservo-drive systems to be modeled using a two-inertia ap-\nproximate model of the system mechanics [1], [2], [4]\u2013[6],\n[9], [10].\nWhile classical proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative (PID) con-\ntrollers are readily realizable and generally effective for a\nwide range of industrial control applications, the derivative\n0278-0046\/$20.00 \u00a9 2006 IEEE\nO\u2019SULLIVAN et al.: HIGH-PERFORMANCE CONTROL OF SERVO-DRIVE SYSTEMS USING INTEGRATED SAW DEVICES 1227\ncontribution to the control action increases the sensitivity of\nthe system to high-frequency unmodeled vibratory modes and\nmeasurement noise. Furthermore, an increasing number of mo-\ntion control applications employ brushless ac machines with an\nintegrated position sensor as the sole motion feedback sensor. If\nmotor acceleration is required for feedback, it is obtained from\nthe double derivative of sensed motor shaft position, which is\nusually from an incremental encoder employing a quadrature\ncount. In practice, measurement noise ultimately bounds the\nhigh-frequency gain of the controller and, therefore, controller\nperformance. Consequently, for high-bandwidth motion control\napplications, PID controllers cannot impart the desired levels\nof dynamic performance in the presence of extraneous inputs.\nA principle feature of this paper is therefore to demonstrate\nimproved servo-drive performance for such systems by manip-\nulating the closed-loop dynamics using constrained proprietary\ncontrol architectures. Notably, therefore, this paper does not\nconsider the use of more generic control design techniques,\nsuch as those based on H\u221e, for instance, since the flexibility\nrequired from the control architecture and the expertise to\ndesign such controllers are not commonly found for the general\napplication of servo drives.\nThe advantages of incorporating measured shaft torque feed-\nback have long been recognized as a solution for enhanc-\ning dynamic performance and imparting disturbance rejection\nproperties in complex mechanical servo-drive systems. How-\never, commonly employed torque transducers, such as those\nbased on strain gauge and optical and inductive sensing device\ntechnologies, are often too mechanically compliant when incor-\nporated in a drive train, further degrading stability margins and\nconsequently requiring a reduction in closed-loop controller\nbandwidth to maintain transient performance, e.g., limited over-\nshoot. Moreover, the additional capital cost associated with\ntheir integration has prohibited widespread application except\nin specialist areas where such expenditure does not consti-\ntute a primary design constraint, an example being a rolling\nmill application where the induced controller bandwidth is\nsufficiently low (< 10 Hz) to enable the use of a capacitive\nshaft torque transducer to reduce torsional resonances [3]. Until\nrecently, therefore, difficulties in acquiring reliable low-cost\nnoninvasive shaft torque transducers have precluded their use in\nall but a minority of specialist closed-loop servo-drive systems,\nand recourse to observer-based state-estimation techniques has\nconsequently been commonplace [4]\u2013[6], [12]. In a simulation\nenvironment, state-variable controllers [13] are readily shown\nto provide enhanced control performance, with the observer\nbandwidth being assigned to be much higher than the system\ndynamics and all the states being assumed delay free and\nnoise free. However, in practical high-performance servo-drive\nsystems employing a single quantized feedback sensor, high-\nbandwidth observers impart problematic noise-amplifying at-\ntributes (similar to the PID controller): stability problems arise\nprimarily due to finite resolution of sensors and unmodeled\nresonant modes. Reducing observer bandwidth can attenuate\nsensor noise at the cost of deterioration in estimation accuracy\nand, ultimately, the controller performance. Consequently, ob-\nservers are not commonly employed in servo-drive systems for\nthe mass-market sector.\nFig. 1. Mechanical schematic. (a) Two-inertia representation of a servo-drive\nsystem. (b) Control block diagram.\nNevertheless, surface acoustic wave (SAW) torque sensors\n[7], [8] have recently emerged as a candidate technology\nfor high-bandwidth applications employing electromechani-\ncal drive trains since they do not significantly affect system\nstiffness; exhibit high sensitivity, high signal-to-noise ratio,\nand high bandwidth; and are relatively unaffected by servo-\nmachine-generated electromagnetic noise and, hence, can be\nintegrated directly within the servo-machine assembly. How-\never, to realize the full dynamic potential offered by these\ndevices, a reconsideration of classical control design techniques\nis required. In particular, while commercial servo-drive systems\nare tuned largely based on obtaining desirable performance\nwith respect to motor shaft velocity, here, the performance of\nthe drive train with respect to load-side dynamics is considered\nsince this is ultimately what most applications require, and, no-\ntably, designing for the former can exhibit poor or undesirable\nload-side performance.\nII. TWO-INERTIA MECHANICAL SYSTEM\nFig. 1(a) provides a schematic of a two-inertia representation\nof a servo-drive system, where the motor angular velocity is de-\nnoted as \u03c9m and the load velocity is denoted as \u03c9d. Since damp-\ning losses are usually considered to be relatively low, they are\nneglected without significantly affecting the accuracy of the for-\ngoing analysis [1], [2], [4]\u2013[6], [9], [10] [12], [13]. Fig. 1(b)\nprovides a dynamic block diagram representation of the two-\ninertia mechanical system from which transfer functions de-\nscribing the relationships between the electromagnetic torque\nproduced by the servo machine, and the machine rotor angular\nvelocity (1) and load angular velocity (2), can be derived,\nsuch as\n\u03c9m(s)\nte(s)\n=\ns2 + \u03c92a\nJms3 + Jm\u03c92ns\n(1)\n\u03c9d(s)\nte(s)\n=\n\u03c92a\nJms3 + Jm\u03c92ns\n(2)\n1228 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOL. 53, NO. 4, AUGUST 2006\nFig. 2. Control block diagrams of the extended PI controllers for the two-inertia mechanical model. (a) PID controller. (b) RRC controller.\nwhere \u03c9a (i.e., the antiresonant frequency) and \u03c9n (i.e., the\nresonant frequency) are defined as\n\u03c9a =\n\u221a\nKmd\n(\n1\nJd\n)\n(3)\n\u03c9n =\u03c9a\n\u221a\nR+ 1 (4)\nand the load-to-motor inertia ratio is\nR =\nJd\nJm\n. (5)\nFrom (4), the relationship between \u03c9n and \u03c9a is dependent\non the load-to-motor inertia ratio R. Ultimately, R will be\nshown to be crucial in determining the complexity of a con-\ntroller to impart good closed-loop tracking performance and\ndisturbance rejection properties.\nIII. PROPORTIONAL\u2013INTEGRAL (PI), PID, AND\nRESONANCE RATIO CONTROL (RRC)\nCONTROL STRUCTURES\nThe forgoing analysis assumes that a sensor for feedback of\nmotor velocity is present on the motor shaft (or derived from\na suitable position measurement) since, notably, it has been\npreviously demonstrated [2] that no fundamental performance\nbenefit is gained by measuring load velocity (as opposed to\nmotor velocity) for closed-loop control (of either the motor or\nload) in a two-inertia system, and the presented situation is the\nmore usual in a commercial turnkey system.\nFig. 2(a) shows the structure of a classical PI control scheme\nwith an additional derivative signal proportional to motor ac-\nceleration being included to form a PID structure, where Kd\nis the derivative feedback gain. An alternative structure is\ngiven in Fig. 2(b), which takes the PI elements of Fig. 2(a)\nand augments them with a feedback signal proportional to\nshaft torque, where the associated feedback gain is Ks. The\nuse of a feedback signal proportional to torsional torque in\nthis manner has been commonly referred to as RRC [4]\u2013[6].\nTheoretically, it can be shown that the PID and RRC controllers\nare able to induce identical closed-loop dynamics, with the\npractical distinction between the two being dependent on the\ncapability of the associated feedback sensor and processing\ninterface\u2014an important aspect that will be considered further in\nSection V-C.\nNotably, the dynamics of the servo-amplifier current con-\ntroller, which is governed primarily by delay time and \u22123-dB\nbandwidth, are assumed to be sufficient to have negligible effect\non the system response, thereby allowing the servo amplifier to\nbe modeled by a unity gain. A key limiting factor for raising the\ndynamic bandwidth of the two-inertia system is ultimately the\nresponse of the speed loop, which is constrained by mechanical\nresonances and the attributes of the feedback sensor, by the\neffects of noise injection (since speed is generally obtained\nfrom the derivative of quantized position) and sensor resonance\ninduced by the physical mounting of the sensor to the motor\n(not specifically considered herein) [14].\nA. PI, PID, and RRC Tracking Dynamics\nFrom the PI control structure of Fig. 2(a), the closed-loop\ntransfer functions from reference velocity \u03c9r to motor velocity\n\u03c9m, and from reference velocity to load velocity \u03c9d (tracking\nO\u2019SULLIVAN et al.: HIGH-PERFORMANCE CONTROL OF SERVO-DRIVE SYSTEMS USING INTEGRATED SAW DEVICES 1229\ndynamics), can be derived, resulting in (6) and (7), respectively,\nwhere J\u02dcm = Jm and R\u02dc = R, viz.\n\u03c9m(s)\n\u03c9r(s)\n=\nKi(s2+\u03c92a)\nJ\u02dcms4+Kps3+\n(\nJ\u02dcm\u03c92a(1+R\u02dc)+Ki\n)\ns2+Kp\u03c92as+Ki\u03c92a\n=\nKi\n(\ns2+\u03c92a\n)\nJ\u02dcms2\n(\ns2+\u03c92a(1+R\u02dc)\n)\n+(Kps+Ki) (s2+\u03c92a)\n(6)\n\u03c9d(s)\n\u03c9r(s)\n=\nKi\u03c9\n2\na\nJ\u02dcms4+Kps3+(J\u02dcm\u03c92a(1+R\u02dc)+Ki)s2 +Kp\u03c92as+Ki\u03c92a\n=\nKi\u03c9\n2\na\nJ\u02dcms2\n(\ns2+\u03c92a(1+R\u02dc)\n)\n+(Kps+Ki)(s2+\u03c92a)\n. (7)\nBy observation, if the closed-loop bandwidth \u03c9x \u0005 \u03c9a (i.e.,\n(s2 + \u03c92a) \u2248 \u03c92a and (s2 + \u03c92a(1 + R\u02dc)) \u2248 \u03c92a(1 + R\u02dc)), then (6)\nand (7) reduce to the second-order lumped-inertia approxima-\ntion (8), as is commonly used for autotuning of servo-drive\nsystems, i.e.,\n\u03c9q(s)\n\u03c9r(s)\n=\nKi\nJ\u02dcm(1 + R\u02dc)s2 +Kps+Ki\n. (8)\nHere, there is no distinction between the motor-side and load-\nside dynamics since it is assumed that the inertias are connected\nvia an infinitely stiff shaft, and \u03c9q therefore represents either\n\u03c9m or \u03c9d. More generally, the closed-loop tracking dynamics\nfor the PID and RRC controllers are similar except that the de-\nnominators of the transfer functions contain \u201cvirtual\u201d mechan-\nical parameters. Specifically, for the PID case, the equivalent\nmotor inertia J\u02dcm and the virtual inertia ratio R\u02dc are\nJ\u02dcm = Jm +Kd R\u02dc =\nJd\nJ\u02dcm\n(PID) (9)\nwhereas for the RRC case, J\u02dcm and R\u02dc are\nJ\u02dcm = Jm R\u02dc = R(1 +KS) (RRC). (10)\nBy inspection of (6) and (7), it can be seen that feedback mea-\nsurements of either torsional torque or motor acceleration (i.e.,\nthe derivative of angular velocity) result in identical controller-\ninduced dynamics, both enabling a change in the virtual inertia\nratio R\u02dc.\nB. Performance Criteria\nController-induced closed-loop performance imparted by the\nPID and RRC schemes and an enhanced scheme proposed in\nTABLE I\nMECHANICAL PARAMETERS\nSection IV are evaluated using the integral of time multiplied\nby absolute error (ITAE) criterion for a step reference input.\nThe ITAE performance index provides the best performance\nselectivity by minimizing overshoot and settling time for a\ngiven rise time or equivalent \u22123-dB bandwidth [11]. Closed-\nloop load-side tracking behaviors given by \u03c9d(s)\/\u03c9r(s), which\nare imparted by the PID and RRC control schemes, are com-\npletely defined by their pole locations (since there are no\nclosed-loop zeros), thereby enabling the required characteristic\nequations for each to be specified by the respective optimal\nITAE indexes. Specifically, for the second-order and fourth-\norder characteristic equations, the optimal ITAE polynomials\nare given by (11) and (12), respectively, where \u03c9x represents\nthe \u22123-dB bandwidth, i.e.,\ns2 + 1.4\u03c9xs+ \u03c92x (11)\ns4 + 2.1\u03c9xs3 + 3.4\u03c92xs\n2 + 2.7\u03c93xs+ \u03c9\n4\nx. (12)\nC. Simulation of a Two-Inertia Test Facility\nAn experimental two-inertia test facility comprising 2 \u00d7\n2.2 kW (Control Techniques, Ltd., Unimotor) brushless\npermanent-magnet servo machines, exited by servo amplifiers\n(Control Techniques, Ltd., Unidrive SP), interconnected via an\ninline SAW-based instrumental torque transducer, has been as-\nsembled. Mechanical parameters of the test facility are given in\nTable I for chosen values of R, which are achieved by inserting\ndisks of various inertia to the motor-side servo machine. Using\nthe presented control structures, dynamic simulation models of\nthe experimental closed-loop system are now used to provide\nperformance comparisons.\nInitially, PI controller gains Kp and Ki are chosen to assign\nthe optimal second-order ITAE characteristic equation (11) to\nthe simplified lumped-inertia model given in (8) and the fourth-\norder system represented by (6) and (7). In this case, the fourth-\norder model, which is tuned with the optimal second-order\nparameters, is compared with the optimal second-order step\nresponse. For example, Fig. 3 shows the difference in the ITAE\nof the load-side step responses of the fourth-order (optimal)\nand second-order models. More generally, step responses of\nthe fourth-order system can be compared with the respective\noptimal second-order step responses, as the per-unit load-side\nclosed-loop tracking bandwidth \u03c9x_pu = \u03c9x\/\u03c9a and R are\nvaried. Results of the investigation are given in Fig. 4, and\nidentifying the frequency range over which the single lumped-\ninertia approximation provides an acceptable model of the\ntwo-inertia mechanical system. In particular, Fig. 4(a) shows\nthe ITAE of the difference between the step responses at the\nmotor side, whereas Fig. 4(b) shows the ITAE of the difference\n1230 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOL. 53, NO. 4, AUGUST 2006\nFig. 3. Example of the difference in the ITAE calculation of the load-side step\nresponses for the fourth-order and second-order (optimal) models.\nbetween the step responses at the load side. The following\ntrends can be identified.\n1) When R = 1 and \u03c9x_pu < 0.4, the single lumped-inertia\nsimplification is seen to provide a good estimation of\ndrive-train performance and is largely insensitive to in-\ncreases in R. For instance, Fig. 5 shows tracking re-\nsponses (step demand of 10 rad\/s) for the motor side (6)\nand the load side (7), with the controller optimally tuned\nfor (8), for cases when \u03c9x_pu = 0.4 and \u03c9x_pu = 0.88\nand R = 1 for both cases.\n2) When R < 1, performance is seen to significantly de-\ngrade, and hence, the tuning mechanism based on the\nsecond-order approximation is not appropriate in this\nregion. This feature is particularly noticeable in the load-\nside performance [Fig. 4(b)].\nIt is concluded therefore that tuning a two-inertia system\naccording to motor-side performance objectives, i.e., using\nsensors mounted directly on the motor shaft, or by assuming a\nlumped-inertia approximation to select the velocity controller\nparameters, as is commonplace in commercial drive-system\ntuning algorithms, may result in undesirable load-side perfor-\nmance, particularly when the load inertia is smaller than the\nmotor inertia. Importantly, these results are also generic to both\nthe PID and RRC structures, with R replaced by R\u02dc, albeit\nimplemented with different feedback sensors, viz. derivative\nof angular velocity for the former and shaft torque feedback\nfor the latter, since the additional complexity provided by these\nschemes only allows independent control of R\u02dc.\nFrom trend 1, when \u03c9x_pu > 0.4, tuning the two-inertia\nmechanical system according to the fourth-order models (6)\nand (7) and the fourth-order optimal ITAE index (12) should\nbe considered. Equating coefficients of the denominator of\n(7) and (12) then provides expressions for the optimal inertia\nratio and solutions for the optimal per-unit load-side closed-\nloop tracking bandwidth ratio \u03c9x_pu. Specifically, equating\ncoefficients requires R = 1.08 and \u03c9x_pu = 0.88 for opti-\nmality. By analyzing closed-loop pole restrictions [2], the\nload-side tracking performance imparted by the PI controller\nfor the fourth-order model shows increasingly underdamped\ntendencies as R reduces from the optimal value or as \u03c9x > \u03c9a.\nHowever, the requirement for R \u2248 1 can be problematic for\nmany servo-drive systems, particularly when a gear-reduction\nstage is employed between the motor and load, which reduces\nthe effective load inertia (from the perspective of the motor) by\nthe square of the gear ratio N2. Although insufficient degrees\nof freedom are available in the PI controller to independently\nassign the optimal value of R, sufficient freedom does exist\nusing the PID and RRC control structures. However, there\nremains no flexibility to independently select the optimal load-\nside closed-loop tracking bandwidth ratio; that is, to satisfy the\noptimal ITAE criteria, it still has to be \u03c9x_pu = 0.88. Moreover,\nin practice, the maximum available \u201ccontrol energy\u201d and the\nquality of the feedback sensor signal also place practical limits\non the virtual inertia ratio. Table II summarizes the optimal\n(fourth-order ITAE polynomial) PI, PID, and RRC controller\ngains as a function of the mechanical parameters.\nBy changing the polarity of the additional feedback gains Ks\nand Kd, R\u02dc can be virtually reduced, if desired, to obtain op-\ntimum load-side tracking performance when R > 1. However,\nas previously shown in Fig. 4, such a reduction does not result\nin significant performance enhancement. For example, the PI\ncontroller is tuned according to the equations given in Table II\n(with Kd = 0) as R is increased (R \u2265 1) by adjusting Jm. For\neach new value of inertia ratio, Kp and Ki are recalculated\nassuming Jd = Jt\/2, where Jt is the total system inertia, i.e.,\nJt = Jm(1 +R), with the resulting step responses given in\nFig. 6 for various R. In this case, the additional complexity of\nthe PID or RRC controllers is not necessary to virtually reduce\nR since good performance is obtained from the basic PI scheme\nwith R \u2265 1. This has also been reported in [2].\nD. Regulation Dynamics\nClosed-loop transfer functions that relate the disturbance\ntorque to load speed (regulation dynamics) have been derived\nin (13) and (14), respectively, shown at the bottom of the page,\nfor the PI, PID, and RRC controllers of Fig. 2. The equivalent\nmotor inertia J\u02dcm and the inertia ratio R\u02dc for the PID controller\nare given in (9) (note that J\u02dcm = Jm and R\u02dc = R for PI),\nwhereas the equivalent inertia ratio R\u02dc for the RRC controller\nis given in (10). Since the closed-loop regulation dynamics\ncontain complex zeros, optimum regulation performance is not\nsolely determined by pole locations. It is notable, however,\nthat when the PID and RRC controllers for the two-inertia\nsystem are tuned for optimum tracking performance according\n\u03c9d\ntd\n=\n(J\u02dcms3 +Kps2 + (Ki +Kmd)s)\/Jd\nJ\u02dcms4 +Kps3 + (J\u02dcm\u03c92a(1 + R\u02dc) +Ki)s2 +Kp\u03c92as+Ki\u03c92a\n(PID) (13)\n\u03c9d\ntd\n=\n(Jms3 +Kps2 + (Ki +Kmd(1 +Ks))s)\/Jd\nJms4 +Kps3 + (Jm\u03c92a(1 + R\u02dc) +Ki)s2 +Kp\u03c92as+Ki\u03c92a\n(RRC) (14)\nO\u2019SULLIVAN et al.: HIGH-PERFORMANCE CONTROL OF SERVO-DRIVE SYSTEMS USING INTEGRATED SAW DEVICES 1231\nFig. 4.

Hence, the PID and RRC controllers theoretically\nresult in identical disturbance rejection properties.\nTo show the influence of R on disturbance rejection perfor-\nmance, the method presented to generate the results of Fig. 6 for\nthe tracking step responses is now repeated to obtain regulation\nresponse characteristics for a step load input of 2 N \u00b7m; the\nresults are given in Fig. 7. It is evident from Fig. 7 that similar\nperformance characteristics are obtained as R is varied.\nIV. RRC+ CONTROL STRUCTURE\nTo address inadequacies of the PID and RRC controllers\nto independently assign R\u02dc and the optimal per-unit load-side\nTABLE II\nPI, PID, AND RRC CONTROLLER GAINS FOR OPTIMAL LOAD-SIDE\nTRACKING PERFORMANCE\ntracking bandwidth (fixed at \u03c9x_pu = 0.88 due to pole as-\nsignment restrictions), an extended control structure is now\nproposed (Fig. 8). Termed RRC+, the technique essentially\nconstitutes state-variable feedback by employing the derivative\nof shaft torque, which is a variable not normally available\nwithout the addition of an extra speed sensor on the load side, or\na state observer, but is now feasible due to recent developments\nin integrated SAW torque transducers. Notably, the derivative\nof shaft torque in a two-inertia system is given by\ndtmd\ndt\n= Kmd(\u03c9m \u2212 \u03c9d) (15)\ni.e., the resulting feedback signal is, in essence, proportional to\nthe difference in motor and load speeds. The resulting fourth-\norder RRC+ load-side tracking and regulation dynamics are\n1232 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOL. 53, NO. 4, AUGUST 2006\nFig. 6.

Simulated regulation step response for the PI controller tuned to a two-\ninertia fourth-order model.\nexpressed in transfer function form by (16) and (17), respec-\ntively, shown at the bottom of the page.\nSince four independently assignable gain variables are now\npresent, namely 1) Kp, 2) Ki, 3) Ks, and 4) Ka, no theoretical\nrestriction exists on the assignment of desired closed-loop\npoles, allowing the optimal fourth-order ITAE denominator\npolynomial (14) to be completely specified. To illustrate re-\nsulting time-domain and frequency-domain attributes, Fig. 9(a)\nshows the optimal closed-loop pole locations, whereas Fig. 9(b)\nshows tracking time-domain performance characteristics as\n\u03c9x_pu is varied. Table III gives the required controller gains for\noptimal load-side tracking performance. It is noteworthy that\nsetting \u03c9x_pu = 0.88 results in Ka = 0, thereby reducing the\ncontroller structure to that of RRC, and substituting \u03c9x_pu =\n0.88 and R = 1 into Table III results in Kd = Ks = 0, further\nreducing the controller to that of PI.\nFor completeness, the effect of a change in load inertia (a\ncommon industrial occurrence) on the transient response (when\n\u03c9x_pu = 1.4) is shown in Fig. 9(c). Generally, as load inertia\nincreases from the nominal value, overshoot and rise time\nincrease. In contrast, for a reduction in inertia, rise time re-\nduces, whereas overshoot remains relatively constant. In either\ncase, however, a general reduction in performance ensues, as\nevidenced by the increase in ITAE. Moreover, for a reduction in\nthe load inertia, the response becomes increasingly oscillatory\nby virtue of a reduction in the inertia ratio R.\nFig. 10 shows the dynamic tracking and regulation responses\nof the proposed RRC+ controller when R = 1. The simulation\nbegins with a 10-rad\/s step demand followed by a 2 N \u00b7m step\ndisturbance torque after 0.8 s. In particular, Fig. 10(a) shows\nthe motor-side and load-side step responses for \u03c9x_pu = 1.4,\nwhereas Fig. 10(b) shows a comparison of load-side step re-\nsponses of the PI controller (optimally tuned to \u03c9x_pu = 0.88\nfor R = 1) and RRC+ controller (\u03c9x_pu = 1.4). It is evident\nthat increasing the optimal tracking bandwidth using the RRC+\ncontroller decreases the overall transient response time as com-\npared with the PI controller and improves both the tracking and\nregulation performance. For completeness, Table IV summa-\nrizes the optimal tracking and regulation performance criteria\nfor the PI, PID, RRC, and RRC+ control schemes.\nV. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION\nA. Experimental Apparatus and SAW Torque Transducer\nThe control characteristics, simulation results, and presented\nobservations are now validated on the experimental test facility\ndescribed in Section III-C (see Fig. 11). Algorithms, sensor\ninputs, and controlled outputs are realized via a digital signal\nprocessor (DSP)-based hardware development platform, as il-\nlustrated in Fig. 11(b). Notably, the sampling rate used for all\ncontrol schemes is 12 kHz, and all feedback signals are filtered\nusing a 1-kHz bandwidth low-pass filter to reduce the effects of\naliasing.\nThe 20 N \u00b7m SAW-based torque transducer contains two\nSAW devices mounted on a shaft of known stiffness and is used\nto realize RRC and RRC+. Each device consists of an array\nof thin-metal electrodes deposited at fractional wavelengths\napart from a polished piezoelectric substrate. An RF signal\napplied to the electrodes excites a SAW over the device that\nresonates at a frequency determined by the distance between the\ninterdigital metal electrodes. Torsion applied to the transducer\ncreates two principle components of strain, namely: 1) Sxx and\n2) Syy, subjecting one SAW device to tension and the other to\ncompression, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 11(c).

After mixing and\nsignal processing, the sum and difference frequencies provide\nshaft torque, temperature, and axial stress compensation out-\nputs. Typically, the SAW resonant frequency is 500 MHz, with\na 500-kHz deviation equating to maximum strain [8]. This is a\nkey advantage of SAW sensor technologies since it provides\na simple noncontact coupling between the rotational devices\nand stationary processing unit, and, by careful design, the\ninfluence of electromagnetic interference can be minimized [7],\n[8]. Moreover, the temperature coefficient of the SAW devices\n1234 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOL. 53, NO. 4, AUGUST 2006\nTABLE III\nRRC+ CONTROLLER GAINS FOR OPTIMAL LOAD-SIDE\nTRACKING PERFORMANCE\nis < 0.01% per \u25e6C for \u221210 \u25e6C to 50 \u25e6C and < 0.15% per \u25e6C\nfor 40 \u25e6C to 125 \u25e6C, allowing them to be accurately used over a\ntypical industrial application temperature range. Furthermore,\nfor control of electromechanical drive trains with significant\nresonances, the bandwidth of the SAW transducer and signal\nprocessing unit is typically > 2 kHz. The commercial inline\ntransducer produces an analog output of 0.25 V\/N \u00b7m from\na combined external signal processing unit and low-voltage\npower supply (12 V, 1 A). Nevertheless, the additional capital\ncost of the 20 N \u00b7m transducer, and associated electronics, is\nonly a fraction of the cost of a similarly rated commercial servo\nmachine and amplifier and is typically less than an integrated\nrotor position encoder.\nB. Experimental Results\nExperimental results now show the performance of the con-\ntrollers in response to a 10-rad\/s step reference demand, with a\ndisturbance load torque of 2 N \u00b7m applied after 0.8 s, thereby\ndepicting the same events used for the simulation studies of\nFigs. 5, \u20137, and 10. Fig. 12 shows responses from use of\nthe PI controller of Fig. 2(a), where Kd = 0. The PI gains\nare optimally tuned for the second-order model, i.e., for (8)\nand (11), for two values of \u03c9x_pu, with R = 1 in both cases,\nthereby reflecting the simulation results described in Fig. 5. By\ncomparison with Fig. 5, therefore, a good agreement between\nthe tracking performance can be seen, with the regulation in\nresponse to the disturbance showing similar transient charac-\nteristics by virtue of having the same characteristic equation\nas for tracking [see (6) and (7), and (13) and (14)]. Further-\nmore, Fig. 12(b) shows results for the PI controller optimally\ntuned using the fourth-order model, i.e., from (7) and (12),\nfor optimal \u03c9x_pu = 0.88 and R = 1 and nonoptimal R = 2\n(i.e., the motor inertia is effectively halved by the removal of\ninertial disks), thereby reflecting the results of Fig. 6. It can\nbe seen that while the gains chosen for optimal R = 1 provide\ngood responses for both the motor-side and load-side dynamics\n(cf. Fig. 6), the increase in inertia ratio to R = 2 has only a\nminor influence on the induced dynamics (when Kp and Ki\nare recalculated assuming Jd = Jt\/2), thereby confirming the\nobservations discussed in Section III-C, where it was stated that\nfor R > 1, the additional complexity afforded by the PID and\nRRC control structures is not necessary.\nFig. 13 shows measurements from the system used with the\nPID and RRC controllers and with R = 0.5 (i.e., below the\noptimum value). The effective Kp and Ki gains are tuned to\nprovide the same performance as those for results depicted\nFig. 10. Simulated tracking and regulation step responses of the RRC+\ncontroller, where R = 1.\nTABLE IV\nOPTIMAL TRACKING PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND REGULATION\nPERFORMANCE COMPARISON\nin Fig. 12(b) [see (7), (9), (10), and (12)]. However, the ad-\nditional complexity afforded by the derivative action of the\nPID controller, and the extra complexity of the RRC, allows\nthe inertia to be \u201ctuned\u201d to be R\u02dc = 1 by adjusting Kd or Ks.\nFrom Fig. 13, it can be seen that both controllers provide near\nidentical characteristics and are consistent with those for the\noptimally tuned PI controller in Fig. 12(b) for R = 1, thereby\ndemonstrating the equivalence of (6) and (7) for the PI, PID,\nand RRC controllers, respectively, when R\u02dc = 1.\nTo show the benefits of RRC+, Fig. 14 shows measure-\nments from the system when the RRC+ controller gains are\nselected to induce user-designed values of optimal bandwidth,\ni.e., \u03c9x_pu = 1, 1.2, and 1.4 (cf. with the simulation results of\nFig. 10), with the mechanical system arranged such that R = 1.\nIt can be seen that while increasing bandwidth reduces rise\ntime, as expected, good load-side dynamics remain for all cases.\nHowever, while maintaining optimum load-side performance,\nthe motor-side dynamics deteriorate as a result of countering the\neffects of shaft compliance. For completeness, the lower trace\nof Fig. 14 compares the load-side performance for the proposed\nRRC+ controller and the basic PI controller. Since R = 1, both\ncan be tuned to provide optimal performance according to the\nITAE polynomial (12). However, the benefit of employing the\nRRC+ is to allow an increase in closed-loop bandwidth without\ndegrading the transient characteristics.\nC.

The modified\nmechanical parameters are therefore given in Table V.\nBoth the PID and RRC (which does not require the derivative\naction since it employs torque feedback) controllers are subse-\nquently tuned according to the equations given in Table II, to\nprovide optimal performance, i.e., R\u02dc = 1, \u03c9x_pu = 0.88. The\nresulting tracking and regulation transient responses for each\nscheme are shown in Fig. 15. It can be seen that while the\nRRC provides expected transient dynamics, the low-pass filter\nrequired to reduce noise in the system when employing the PID\nstructure imparts a significant deterioration in performance by\nvirtue of reducing stability margins.\n1236 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOL. 53, NO. 4, AUGUST 2006\nFig. 14.

Such a signal requires the triple\nderivative of encoder position, and the elevated noise levels\nmay only be suppressed by low-pass filtering (over and above\nthat required of a PID control scheme), thereby rendering it un-\nsuitable for use in a high-bandwidth state-variable controller of\nthe type considered herein, i.e., the proposed RRC+ controller.\nNevertheless, since the RRC+ controller generally requires a\nderivative contribution of shaft torque and higher gains than\nits RRC counterpart, the closed-loop bandwidth is ultimately\nrestricted in practice due to elevated noise levels. In an attempt\nto promote increased bandwidth, RRC+ was implemented via\na signal proportional the difference in sensed motor and load\nspeeds (using the first derivative of motor and load position;\ncf. (15)]; however, in so doing, no bandwidth advantage could\nbe obtained. This was primarily a result of the relatively good\nsignal-to-noise characteristics exhibited by the torque trans-\nducer measured at \u2248 55 dB. Furthermore, the advantage of the\nproposed RRC+ scheme for the two-inertia system is that only\nvariables sensed at the motor side, as opposed to the load side,\nare required.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nVarious compensation schemes have been investigated for\nthe coordinated motion control of two-inertia mechanical sys-\nTABLE V\nMODIFIED MECHANICAL PARAMETERS\nFig. 15. Experimental tracking and regulation step responses for the RRC and\nPID controllers, where R = 0.25 and R\u02dc = 1.\ntems. The distinction between the resulting motor-side and\nload-side dynamics has been discussed, and the conditions that\nhave been derived show when a dual-inertia system can be\nadequately described by a second-order closed-loop approxi-\nmation and when an undesirable load-side performance will\nresult, thereby necessitating the use of a fourth-order drive-\ntrain model.\nIt has been shown that a basic second-order PI control\nscheme is adequate to provide good closed-loop performance\nwhen the inertia ratio of the motor and load is greater, or\nequal to unity, and the induced closed-loop bandwidth is less\nthan 0.4\u00d7 antiresonant frequency of the two-inertia system.\nUnder converse conditions, the fourth-order model is shown\nto be necessary, and, while the PI control scheme can still\nimpart optimal closed-loop characteristics (based on the ITAE\ncriterion), no freedom exists for the designer to choose a desired\nclosed-loop bandwidth and inertia ratio. Consequently, the extra\nflexibility afforded by the PID and RRC control schemes is\nshown to be sufficient to simultaneously impart optimal closed-\nloop performance while also allowing the independent selection\nof virtual inertia ratio.\nOn a practical issue, although the PID and RRC controllers\nare demonstrated to be theoretically able to impart identical\nclosed-loop dynamic attributes to the system, a qualitative\nstudy of the practical effects of using a double derivative of\nmotor shaft position to generate the D of the PID controller,\nand the torque signal from a high-performance (albeit low-\ncost) torque sensor (a SAW-based device in this case), has\nshown that the RRC-type structure is a preferred solution.\nMoreover, the proposed RRC+ scheme is subsequently shown\nto additionally facilitate independent assignment of closed-loop\nbandwidth over and above that previously reported for the\nRRC control schemes without inducing problems associated\nO\u2019SULLIVAN et al.: HIGH-PERFORMANCE CONTROL OF SERVO-DRIVE SYSTEMS USING INTEGRATED SAW DEVICES 1237\nwith the requirement for a load-side position sensor or a signal\nproportional to the triple derivative of motor-side position.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank the U.K. Engineering\nand Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) and Sensor\nTechnology, Ltd., Banbury, U.K., for the provision of an\nEPSRC CASE studentship.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S.
