In vitro studies have shown that they exhibit a\ndose-dependent antiproliferative effect on T and B lymphocytes,\ndendritic cells, natural killer cells and various B cell tumour lines -\nan effect that is both cell contact and soluble factor dependent.\nAnimal models of autoimmune disease treated with multipotent\nmesenchymal stromal cells have mostly exhibited a positive clinical\nresponse, as have a limited number of patients suffering from acute\ngraft versus host disease. This review summarizes the findings of a\n1-day meeting devoted to the subject with the aim of coordinating\nefforts.\nIntroduction\nAlthough mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are most readily\nrecognized in the musculoskeletal system as potential\norchestrators of bone and cartilage repair, it has become\napparent in recent years that they may also have profound\nimmunomodulatory effects. Around 70 people participated in\nthis 1-day meeting at the Kennedy Institute for Rheumatology,\nLondon, on 31 October 2005, to explore the latter aspect of\nMSC biology in relationship to autoimmune diseases (ADs).\nThe aim was to bring together workers in the fields of MSC\nbiology and AD in order to define areas of potential synergy\nand interdisciplinary collaboration. As pointed out by the\ndirector of the institute, Marc Feldmann, following the rapidly\ngrowing activity in the past few years in defining stem cell\nparticipation in autoimmune mechanisms and in the use of\nadult stem cells to treat ADs, a focus on the MSC has\nemerged.\nSuch cellular therapy is already in an exploratory phase for\ntreating severe acute graft versus host disease (GvHD) [1],\nwhich bears many similarities to some severe inflammatory\nADs. The mechanisms for such positive therapeutic effects\nMeeting report\nImmunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells: a\nreview based on an interdisciplinary meeting held at the\nKennedy Institute of Rheumatology Division, London, UK, 31\nOctober 2005\nAlan Tyndall1, Ulrich A Walker1, Andrew Cope2, Francesco Dazzi3, Cosimo De Bari2, Willem\nFibbe4, Serena Guiducci5, Simon Jones3, Christian Jorgensen6, Katarina Le Blanc7, Frank Luyten8, \nDennis McGonagle9, Ivan Martin1, Chiara Bocelli-Tyndall1, Giuseppina Pennesi10, Vito Pistoia11,\nConstantino Pitzalis2, Antonio Uccelli12, Nico Wulffraat13 and Marc Feldmann2\n1Rheumatology, University Hospital Basel, Felix Platter Spital, Burgfelderstrasse 101, Basel, CH-4012, Switzerland\n2Medicine, DIIID, Rheumatology, King's College London, Strand, London, WC2R 2LS, UK\n3Stem Cell Biology, Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology Division, ARC Building, 1 Aspenlea Road, London, W6 8LH, UK\n4Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Albinusdreef 2, Building 1, E3-Q, Leiden, 2300 RC, The Netherlands\n5Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, University of Florence, Viale Morgagni, 85, Florence, I-50134, Italy\n6Service d'Immuno-Rhumatologie, Lapeyronie University Hospital, 371, av. du Doyen Gaston Giraud, Montpellier, F - 34295, France\n7Division of Clinical Immunology, Karolinska Institute, CMB, Box 285, Stockholm, SE-171 77, Sweden\n8Rheumatology Section, Leuven University Medical Centre, Herestraat 49, bus 813, Leuven, B - 3000, Belgium\n9Molecular Medicine Unit, Rheumatology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK\n10Neuroimmunologia, University of Genova, Via L.B.

In addition, MSCs have been shown to exhibit tissue\nprotective and regenerative properties beyond immuno-\nsuppression, making them attractive therapeutic agents in\ncomplex AD in which an admix of inflammatory and scarring\ntissue damage is often present.\nOn the other hand, MSCs may also actively participate in\ninitiating AD [3], they have the potential to favour spread of\nmelanoma metastases [4] and, although mostly immune\nprivileged, they may under certain conditions also be subject\nto immune rejection [5]. Thus, their role in treatment of ADs\nmust be assessed carefully.\nDefinition of a MSC\nAlthough a true mesenchymal stem cell undoubtedly exists,\nthe commonly used terminology for various stroma-derived\nprogenitor cells, \u2018MSC\u2019, is scientifically inaccurate because a\ntrue stem cell property has not been demonstrated. A true\nstem cell, when dividing, gives rise to one daughter cell that\nretains its full stem property, whereas the second daughter\nprogenitor cell has the potential, on proliferation and\ndifferentiation, to replenish a complete pleiomorphic tissue\ncompartment. The best studied example is the haemato-\npoietic stem cell. Also, the difference between embryonic and\nadult (postnatal) somatic stem cells should be emphasized.\nThe International Society of Cellular Therapy recently\nreported a consensus statement on the nomenclature and\ndefinition of these progenitor cells [6]. Better termed a\n\u2018multipotent mesenchymal stromal cell\u2019, such a cell should be\nplastic adherent (1-5 days), have fibroblast-like morphology,\nbear at least the stromal markers CD73 and CD105, and be\nnegative for the haematopoietic markers CD14, CD34 and\nCD45. Although opinions differ [7], the commonly agreed\nmarkers are highlighted in bold in Table 1. In addition, a\ntrilineage potential for osteogenic, adipogenic and\nchondrogenic differentiation should be demonstrable\n(Figure 1). Chondrogenic differentiation is a tedious\nprocedure to perform. However, cell populations satisfying\nthese criteria are likely to still be heterogeneous. For practical\npurposes, the multipotent mesenchymal stromal cell is\nabbreviated to MSC in the subsequent text.\nDuring the past few years various phenotypic descriptions of\nMSCs in mouse and humans have been employed, which are\npartly summarized in Table 1. This has led to some confusion\nbecause the original monoclonal antibodies used by early\nworkers have since been shown to be directed to epitopes\non known CD antigens, for example SH3 and SH4 bind to\nepitopes on CD73 [8] and SH2 to CD105 (also called\nendoglin).\nAn extensive and referenced summary of MSC phenotypic\nnomenclature is presented in Table 2.\nOrigin and sources of MSCs\nMSCs were originally described in bone marrow (BM) [9],\nwhere they were also termed \u2018marrow stromal cells\u2019. How-\never, it has now became clear that similar but heterogeneous\npopulations of progenitor cells are also present in many other\ntissues. MSCs can be isolated from periosteum [7,10],\nmuscle [11,12], synovium [13], synovial fluid [14], liver and\nblood [15], cord blood [16] and fat [17], among others. The\nsource of MSCs has an influence on phenotype and\nfunctional properties.\nCosimo De Bari reported that human MSCs from periosteum\nhave greater capacity to form bone in vivo than do human\nMSCs from synovial membranes [7]. Simon Jones and\nChristian Jorgensen showed that synovia-derived MSCs also\ndiffer from their BM counterparts in their gene expression\nprofiles, with activin A being more highly expressed in BM-\nMSCs [18]. Katarina Le Blanc pointed out that MSCs differ\nbetween foetal and adult tissues, as indicated by the\ndifferential expression of genes related to tissue\ndevelopment, cell cycle promotion, chromatin regulation,\nDNA repair and immunological antigen presentation [19].\nLastly, but not surprisingly, the differentiation of MSCs also\nwas found to alter their functional properties.\nMechanism of the antiproliferative and\nimmunosuppressive effects\nMSCs have immunomodulatory properties that are among the\nmost intriguing aspects of their biology [20]. Francesco Dazzi\nreported, in a murine model, that MSCs inhibit the division of\nstimulated T cells by preventing their entry into the S phase of\nthe cell cycle and by mediating an irreversible G0\/G1 phase\narrest [2]. MSCs also induced arrest of T-cell division in\nmixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs); this effect was\nirreversible upon removal of the MSCs. In primate [21] and\nhuman [22,23] models reversibility is observed. In contrast to\nthe strong inhibitory effects of MSCs on T-cell proliferation,\nthere were only relatively minor and reversible effects on the\nT-cell effector function, as measured by IFN-\u03b3 production, and\nno effects on T-cell activation, based on CD25 and CD69\nsurface expression. Dazzi summarized these differential\nimmunomodulatory effects of MSCs on T-cell functions as\n\u2018split tolerance\u2019. The T-cell inhibition does not appear to be\nantigen specific [21], works across HLA barriers, and targets\nprimary and secondary responses [24]. Interestingly, the T-\ncell proliferation was found to be inhibited across strain (allo-)\nand species (xeno-) barriers. Jones, however, showed that\nimmunosuppression may be not only be an intrinsic property\nof MSCs in particular but also of mature and immature\nstromal cells in general, because osteoblasts have similar\nantiproliferative effect (unpublished data).\nVito Pistoia outlined that MSCs also have an effect on B\ncells. In vitro, B-cell proliferation is inhibited by MSCs in a\ndose-dependent manner, with maximum inhibition observed\nat a B-cell\/MSC ratio of 1:1 [25].

B-cell inhibition by MSCs is attributable to blockade\nin G0\/G1 phases of the cell cycle similar to T cells. MSCs\nalso reduce the expression of chemokine receptors and\nimmunoglobulin production by stimulated B cells. MSCs,\nhowever, do not appear to alter surface molecules that are\ninvolved in stimulatory cell cooperation (HLA-DR, CD40 and\nB7 family) or to inhibit the expression of tumour necrosis\nfactor (TNF), IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-10.\nWillem Fibbe showed that MSCs also inhibit the differen-\ntiation of monocytes into immature dendritic cells (DCs) [26].\nDazzi and coworkers have confirmed this observation and\ndemonstrated that MSCs mediate a block of the monocyte\ncell cycle at the G0 phase in this case also [27]. Cell contact\nbetween MSCs and DCs is not required and soluble factors\nthat mediate inhibition of differentiation are produced as a\nresult of crosstalk between MSCs and DCs. Expression by\nDCs of costimulatory molecules is downregulated, and DCs\nexhibit impaired cytokine production and a reduced ability to\nstimulate T cells. MSCs also inhibit the IL-1 and CD40 ligand\ninduced maturation of immature into mature DCs. Aggarwal\nand Pittenger [28] also demonstrated that MSCs cause\nimmature DCs to decrease TNF-\u03b1 and mature DCs to\nincrease IL-10 secretion.\nArthritis Research & Therapy    Vol 9 No 1 Tyndall et al.\nPage 4 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nFigure 1\nTrilineage differentiation of MSCs.

On the other\nhand, the same group from the Karolinska Institute showed\nthat MSCs reduce the formation of CTLs via a soluble factor,\nbut they are not themselves subject to immune recognition by\nCTLs and allogeneic NK cells [29].\nRecently reported data [30] suggest that MSCs significantly\ninhibit IL-2 stimulated proliferation of resting NK cells, but\nthey only partly impair activated NK cell proliferation. The\nsame group showed that IL-2 activated NK cells lyse\nautologous and allogeneic MSCs, which is a property not\nseen with freshly isolated NK cells. Cell-cell contact and\nsoluble factors such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and\nprostaglandin (PG)E2 are responsible for this effect [31].\nMoreover, when MSCs were exposed to IFN-\u03b3 lysis was\nreduced, presumably because of upregulation of HLA class I\nmolecules on the MSC surface. The NK receptors activating\nthe lysis included NKp30 and NKG2D, for which MSCs have\nligands. This has also been demonstrated by another group\n[32]; however, that group did not demonstrate protection by\nexpression of HLA class I molecules on the MSCs.\nSeveral speakers addressed the issue of the role of soluble\nfactors in the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs. Human\nMSCs caused T-helper-1 cells to decrease IFN-\u03b3 and T-helper-\n2 cells to increase IL-4 secretion. Addition of IFN-\u03b3 to MSCs in\nvitro increases their antiproliferative effect in a MLR [33].\nA critical effect of IL-6 in MLRs was stressed by Jorgenson,\nwho showed that IL-6 was released by MSCs and that, if\nblocked with anti-IL-6 antibodies, normal T-cell proliferation\nwas restored in an MLR. Fibbe also showed in DCs that the\nMSC-mediated immunosuppression was prevented by\naddition of anti-IL-6 and anti-macrophage colony stimulating\nfactor antibodies, at least in part [26]. TNF-\u03b1 also reversed\nthe immunosuppressive effect of MSCs on the MLR.\nPrevious experiments by Di Nicola and coworkers [34] have\nsuggested that two soluble factors, namely hepatocyte\ngrowth factor and TGF-\u03b2, were also involved. The addition of\nanti-HGF and anti-TGF-\u03b2 partially restored the proliferation of\nCD2+ cells in the presence of MSCs. However, others were\nunable to reproduce these results [35].\nIndoleamine 2\u2032,3\u2032-dioxygenase (IDO) is an enzyme that is\ninduced by IFN-\u03b3 on the surface of antigen-presenting cells\nand then converts tryptophane to kynurenine. The\ndegradation of tryptophane, as an amino acid that is essential\nfor lymphocyte proliferation, was suggested to inhibit T-cell\nproliferation [36]. The same mechanism has been shown to\noperate for MSCs as well [37]. However, interpretation of\nthese effects is complicated by the fact that the immuno-\nsuppressive kinetics of MSCs were found not to correspond\nto those of IDO expression and tryptophane depletion\n[37,38]. Recently, failure to achieve significant restoration of\nT-cell proliferation via tryptophane addition was reported and\nattributed to the production of T-cell inhibitory kynurenine\nmetabolites, which may have immunosuppressive properties\nin their own right [39,40]. Inhibitors of PGE2 synthesis\nmitigated the overall immunosuppressive effects in co-\ncultures, suggesting that PGE2 may also play an important\nrole in the immune modulation [28]. However, others have not\ndetected significant reversal in T-cell proliferation when using\nPGE2 synthesis inhibitors or tryptophane [38]. Jorgenson\ninvestigated a murine MSC line and found PGE2, but not\nIDO, to be involved in the immunosuppressive effects.\nMSCs not only appear to downregulate the immunoreactivity\nof a variety of effector cells, but also they themselves are\nbelieved to escape immune rejection. MSCs are not targets\nfor CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes or KIR-ligand mismatched\nNK cells in vitro [34,38,41,42]. After in utero transplantation\ninto sheep, human MSCs persist in the long term and\ndemonstrate site-specific differentiation [43].\nMSCs from patients with autoimmune\ndisease\nChiara Bocelli-Tyndall tested the ability of healthy BM-derived\nMSCs to suppress the proliferation of PBMCs derived from\nhealthy donors or from patients with a variety of ADs. MSCs\nlowered the proliferation of PBMCs stimulated with anti-CD3\nand anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies by 50-90%, depending\non the cell ratio. The immunosuppressive effect was\nindependent of the source of PBMCs and of AD subtype,\ndisease activity and concurrent treatment. In addition, BM-\nderived MSCs from AD patients were also suppressive in\nautologous and allogeneic settings. A variety of transformed\nand malignant B-cell lines were also suppressed by BM-\nderived MSCs, again in a dose-dependent manner [44].\nThese results were confirmed by Jones, using MSCs derived\nfrom the synovial membrane of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)\npatients, although there was variability in their progenitor\nfunction as indicated by differentiation potential.\nSerena Guiducci has compared morphological and functional\nproperties of BM-derived MSCs from patients with systemic\nsclerosis (SSc) and healthy control individuals. No significant\ndifferences were observed with respect to the formation of\nfibroblast colony forming units and the differentiation potential\nof MSCs into the osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. On\nthe other hand, MSCs from SSc patients exhibited impaired\nability to form capillary-like structures in vitro (unpublished\ndata). This is an interesting observation in the light of the\nimpaired vascular functions observed in SSc patients.\nMSC differences within and between species\nGiuseppina Pennesi pointed out that MSCs differ between\nmouse strains in their clonogenic, differentiation and\nAvailable online http:\/\/arthritis-research.com\/content\/9\/1\/301\nPage 5 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nproliferation potentials. There may be also differences in\ncytokines and their receptors. Differences between species\nwere reported by LeBlanc, who showed that human MSCs\nengraft in sheep whereas they elicit xenoreactions and are\nrejected in rats. Quantitative in vitro differences were\nobserved by Frank Luyten, who compared the osteogenic\npotential of periosteal derived progenitors between humans\nand rabbits. In vivo, however, the difference was more striking;\nwhereas human progenitors were able to differentiate into\nbone, their rabbit-derived counterparts were not [45].\nClinical use of MPCs\nFrom the clinical point of view, MSC research is currently\nfocused on four areas of intense interest: MSCs may be used\nto engineer cartilage, bone, muscle, fat, tendon and neuronal\ncells; they may serve as cell vehicles for gene therapy; they\nmay enhance engraftment in haematopoietic stem cell\ntransplants; and their immunoregulatory properties, if proven\nto be effective in vivo, could be of therapeutic use in AD.\nTissue repair and gene delivery\nDennis McGonagle emphasized the differences between\nMSCs in vitro and those in vivo and the possible implications\nof these for the immunomodulatory activity of MSCs. For\nexample, when culture expanded MSCs are MHC class II and\nCD80 negative, both of these markers are present in vivo\n[46]. In patients suffering from RA and osteoarthritis, MSCs\nwere more than 20 times more numerous in osteoarthritis\nthan RA [14]. These findings emphasize the importance of\nestablishing the relationship between MSCs and inflam-\nmation in vivo. Furthermore, MSCs derived from synovial\nmembranes differed in their expression of transcription\nfactors and differentiation potential compared with\nmesenchymal cells derived from other sources such as skin\nfibroblasts [13].\nIvan Martin studied the expansion of MSCs in three-\ndimensional scaffolds. Three-dimensional culture is an\ninteresting new approach to large-scale commercial\nproduction and tissue repair (for example, bone and cartilage)\nbecause of the improved clonogenicity and differentiation\ncapacity of MSCs [47]. Bocelli-Tyndall, in collaboration with\nothers, has shown that mature articular chondrocytes are\nmore antiproliferative than de-differentiated chondrocytes or\nBM stromal cells or dermal fibroblasts, raising the question of\nthe role of the antiproliferative effect in the control of tissue\norganization and maintenance [48].\nNico Wulffraat reported that local delivery of adult MSCs\nimproved the regeneration of menisci in a caprine model of\nosteoarthritis and retarded the progressive destruction\nnormally seen [49]. Le Blanc also highlighted the potential\nuse of MSCs in cellular therapy for bone diseases. In children\nwith osteogenesis imperfecta, osteoblast engraftment\n(1.5-2% donor cells) was detected after postnatal MSC\ninfusion; also, improvements in bone mineral content and\ngrowth velocity, and reductions in bone fracture frequency\nwere recorded [50,51]. Le Blanc also reported on an\nintrauterine transplantation into a female human foetus with\nosteogenesis imperfecta. MSCs from an HLA-mismatched\nmale donor were infused in the 32nd week of pregnancy.\nAfter an uneventful pregnancy a bone biopsy performed at 9\nmonths of age demonstrated engraftment of Y chromosome\npositive cells (7.4% of total cells) [52]. These findings prove\nthat allogeneic mesenchymal cells can engraft and\ndifferentiate into bone.\nMyogenic differentiation of MSCs may also be employed for\nmuscle repair. Human MSCs preferentially home to damaged\nmuscle after systemic administration [53]. They contribute to\nmyofibres and to long-term persisting functional satellite cells;\nfurthermore, they restore sarcolemmal dystrophin when they\nare injected into the muscles of the immunosuppressed\nmyodystrophic mdx mouse.\nMSC enhance haematopoietic engraftment\nMSCs are capable of homing to the BM and survive in the\nlong term (>1 year) [54]. In an allogeneic animal model, they\nwere not rejected by the host [4]. However, recent data from\na murine model suggest that, in nonmyeloablated hosts,\nallogeneic MSCs are able to mount a T-cell memory response,\nwhich results in rejection of the haematopoietic stem cell graft\nderived from the same MSC donor [5]. A similar loss of\nimmune privilege has been reported by others [55].\nBecause of their particular function in the marrow micro-\nenvironment, there is evidence suggesting that MSCs\nimprove haematopoietic stem cell engraftment by replacing\nthe damaged marrow stroma after myeloablative chemo-\ntherapy. Although several studies in animal models clearly\nshowed that stromal cells could help in haematopoietic\nrecovery, controversial findings have been reported in\nhumans. In fact, it is not clear whether MSCs can replace the\nmarrow stroma damaged by the myeloablative chemotherapy.\nWhen extensively T-cell-depleted marrow or mobilized blood\nwas given, a low percentage (17%) of mixed chimerism\ncould be detected at the stromal cell level, suggesting a\nlimited but effective capacity of reconstituting the BM\nmicroenvironment [4].\nClinical use of MSC-induced immunosuppression\nAn immunosuppressive effect of MSCs in vivo was first\nsuggested in baboons, in which infusion of ex vivo expanded\ndonor or third-party MSCs delayed the time to rejection of\nhistoincompatible skin grafts [21]. Several presentations\ndealt with the potential use of MSCs in acute GvHD. The\namount, timing and source of MSCs appear to be important.\nMSCs reduce acute and chronic GvHD when co-infused with\nHLA identical haematopoietic stem cells. Dazzi reported that\nmultiple but not single infusions of MSCs prevent the\ngeneration of GvHD effectors in a NOD SCID (nonobese\nArthritis Research & Therapy    Vol 9 No 1 Tyndall et al.\nPage 6 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ndiabetic, severe combined immunodeficient) mouse model\nreceiving human donor lymphocytes. MSCs administered at\nthe time of established GvHD in contrast were ineffective.\nThis is consistent with a recent report [56] in which the\nauthors were unable to show reduction in GvHD in a murine\nmodel (C57BL\/6 into BALBc), although the MSCs were\ngiven in doses that were immunosuppressive in vitro. These\nobservations were not due to the rejection of the MSCs.\nHaploidentical MSCs were used in a 9-year-old boy with\nsevere treatment-resistant GvHD of the gut, skin and liver\nafter allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation for\nacute lymphocytic leukaemia. The boy\u2019s symptoms of GvHD\nand related clinicopathological findings improved after\ntransplantation of haploidentical MSCs derived from his\nmother [1]. Several international randomized trials are being\nlaunched under the auspices of the European Group for\nBlood and Marrow Transplantation stem cell subcommittee\ntargeting acute GvHD treatment and prevention, using\nstandardized expansion protocols and defined culture media\nbased on phase I\/II experience [57].\nAntonio Uccelli showed that MSCs improve both clinical and\nhistological severity of experimental allergic encephalo-\nmyelitis. Early after infusion, the MSCs engraft in secondary\nlymphoid organs, where they induce reversible T-cell\nunresponsiveness and possibly also impair B-cell responses\n[58]. At a later stage after infusion, the MSCs reach the\nsubarachnoid space and then diffuse inside the inflamed\nparenchyma. The responses were more pronounced when\nMSC treatment was initiated early in the course of the\ndisease. Reversal with IL-2 treatment indicates that anergy\nrather than clonal deletion had occurred [58].\nIn collagen-induced arthritis, findings are different from those\nin the experimental allergic encephalomyelitis models.\nJorgensen reported that his group was unable to demonstrate\na beneficial effect when injecting the murine C3HT101\/2\nMSC cell line systemically or intra-articularly. Labelled MSCs\nwere not found in the articular environment [59]. The lack of\ntherapeutic success may be attributed to increased levels of\nTNF-\u03b1 in experimental arthritis, which was shown to reverse\nthe immunosuppressive properties of MSCs. However,\nPennesi suggested a beneficial effect in another murine\narthritis model.\nThe anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs have been also tested\nin mice exposed to bleomycin, a model of lung fibrosis. When\nMSCs were infused immediately after injury, they homed to the\naffected lung and reduced inflammation and fibrosis. This\neffect was not observed when MSCs were given late after the\ninduction [60]. Clearly, more animal model work is required.\nFrom bench to bedside\nLuyten gave an overview about the difficulties in the\nwidespread clinical exploitation of MSCs. One major problem\nis the lack of a commercial Good Manufacturing Practice\nlicensed MSC product. There are no generally accepted\nassays of the potency of MSCs, and the optimal route of\nMSC delivery must be defined for individual indications. The\nbest MSC source, its purity and the optimal dose remain to\nbe specified. Purity, also defined as the identification and\npresence of \u2018contaminating\u2019 cell populations, is critical\nbecause the degree of contamination may affect both the\nbiological effects observed as well as the potential side\neffects. Quantification of all of these factors will be required\nto obtain a reproducible and consistent cell preparation that\ncould potentially be used in clinical studies.\nSafety issues are a concern, although injection of syngeneic,\nallogeneic and xenogeneic MSCs into immunocompetent\nmice is tolerated without apparent side effects. MSCs,\nhowever, are weakly HLA class I positive; thus, repeated\ninfusions may induce alloreactivity. Moreover, MSCs are\ncurrently cultivated in the presence of animal serum. In the\ntherapy of osteogenesis imperfecta by MSCs, antibody\nformation to foetal bovine serum was detected in some\nsubjects [61]. This and other risks associated with usage of\nanimal serum may be overcome by its replacement with\nhuman platelet lysate, which also promotes MSC expansion\n[62]. Finally, MSC-induced immunosuppression may foster\nthe growth of tumours, as exemplified in a murine melanoma\nmodel [4].\nA platform model for cellular therapy research and application\nwas presented by Constantino Pitzalis who emphasized the\nneed for assessing the ability of a biological agent to achieve\nits defined effect, to measure potency and to ensure that\nbioassays include animal based, cellular and biochemical\nsystems. A model of vasculogenesis in a SCID mouse was\npresented as an example.\nConclusion\nThe potential antiproliferative and immunodulatory role of\nMSCs is being intensely studied by diverse groups, with the\nhope that MSCs may be developed as a new treatment for\nsevere human ADs. Despite the heterogeneous nature of\nstromal progenitor cell populations, a consensus concerning\nthe definition of MSCs and Good Manufacturing Practice\nprotocols are evolving. Acute GvHD has been modulated\nsuccessfully in case reports and small series, with apparently\nlow acute toxicity [57,63]. Long-term safety data are needed.\nScanty and sometimes contradictory AD animal data are\navailable. Although the results from syngeneic and\nautologous MSC infusion mostly support the concept, more\ndata on the immunonogenicity of MSCs in non-\nimmunocompromised animals, on the optimal source, on the\ntiming and number of cells to be infused, and on the location\nand determinants of cell homing are needed. It would also be\ndesirable to characterize better the differences in functional\nand antiproliferative properties of BM-derived MSCs between\nAvailable online http:\/\/arthritis-research.com\/content\/9\/1\/301\nPage 7 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nindividuals suffering from various ADs. Recent work suggests\nthat BM MSCs from AD patients may not be equivalent to\nthose derived from healthy individuals in all respects [64]. It is\nalso foreseeable that autologous sources of MSCs other than\nthe BM could be employed. For example, adipose tissue\nderived MSCs were recently suggested to have properties\nsimilar to their BM-derived counterparts [65]. In addition to\nthe current application of MSCs in the treatment and\nprevention of acute GvHD, MSCs could also be considered\nin the emerging programme of allogeneic haematopoietic\nstem cell transplantation for AD [66].\nClearly, a prospective co-ordinated programme would be\nbest, with collaboration between groups dealing with auto-\nimmune diseases and cellular therapies.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.\nReferences\n1.
