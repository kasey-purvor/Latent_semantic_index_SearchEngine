Death rates have been falling in the UK since the late 79 \n1970s.  However, despite this improvement, death rates are still amongst the highest 80 \nin the world. Morbidity, in contrast to mortality, is rising with over 378,000 inpatient 81 \ncases treated for CHD in UK NHS hospitals in 2000\/2001, representing 5% of all 82 \ninpatient cases in men and 2% in women.(1)  The cost of CHD to the UK health care 83 \nsystem in 1999 was estimated as \u00a31.73 billion rising to \u00a37.06 billion when informal 84 \ncare and productivity losses were included.(2)  85 \n 86 \nCoronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause of CHD, with most CAD 87 \ncaused by the narrowing of the large and medium sized arteries serving the heart.  88 \nMethods of detecting and assessing the presence and extent of CAD have become 89 \nincreasingly important in applying therapies to reduce morbidity and mortality.  90 \nCoronary angiography is considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d for defining the site and 91 \nseverity of coronary artery lesions but it is costly and associated with significant risk 92 \nof mortality and morbidity and not recommended without prior non-invasive 93 \ntesting. 94 \n 95 \nOf the non-invasive tests available the most widely used, due its relatively low cost 96 \nand availability, is stress (induced by either exercise or pharmacological agents) 97 \nelectrocardiography (ECG). However, a normal stress ECG does not exclude CAD.  98 \nFurthermore, it performs poorly in low-risk populations.(3) Imaging techniques such 99 \nas myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) can also be used to improve detection 100 \nand\/or localisation of CAD.  MPS uses an intravenously administered 101 \nradiopharmaceutical to evaluate regional coronary flow after stress and at rest.  In 102 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d  \n 6 \nsingle photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), the raw data are then 103 \nprocessed to obtain tomographic images.   104 \n 105 \nThese non-invasive tests can be used either alone or in combination but it is not clear 106 \nwhich of the possible diagnostic strategies that could be devised would be most 107 \nefficient.  This is an issue that has been addressed by a number of earlier economic 108 \nevaluations that have recently been systematically reviewed.(4)  This systematic 109 \nreview found that strategies involving SPECT were likely to be either dominant or 110 \nproduced more quality adjusted life years at an acceptable cost, relative to those that 111 \ndid not contain SPECT but that there was little consistency in the literature about 112 \nwhich of the various strategies that involved SPECT was optimal.  The available 113 \neconomic evaluations were almost all conducted in a single country (the US) and 114 \ntheir results may have limited transferability to other settings.  More importantly the 115 \nresults of all these evaluations were subject to considerable uncertainty which was 116 \naddressed in only a limited fashion (if at all) by sensitivity analysis. Two particular 117 \nshortcomings can be identified. First, the available economic evaluations relied on 118 \nthe results of either a single primary study, which may not be reliable and or 119 \ngeneralisable, or a review of studies in which comparisons between the diagnostic 120 \nperformance of tests were based on indirect comparisons which may be prone to 121 \nselection bias.  Second, where sensitivity analysis was conducted the methods used 122 \nwere not well suited to addressing the statistical uncertainty surrounding the data 123 \nused in the study.(5)  124 \n 125 \nIn this study an attempt has been made to overcome these limitations in an 126 \nevaluation of which strategy for the diagnosis of CAD is most likely to be cost-127 \neffective.  In particular, the evaluation compares alternative strategies involving 128 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d \n 7 \nSPECT alone or in combination with other non-invasive tests with strategies that do 129 \nnot involve SPECT. 130 \n 131 \nMETHODS 132 \nOverview of the Model 133 \nEconomic Modelling techniques were used to compare diagnostic strategies 134 \nincluding SPECT to strategies that did not. A two-stage model was developed. In the 135 \nfirst stage, a decision tree model (DTM), constructed in Excel(6), was used for the 136 \ndiagnosis decision (Figure 1) and in the second stage a Markov Model, developed in 137 \nData 4.0(7),  was created to model longer term cost and consequences (Figure 2). 138 \nSpecifically, it considered the management of patients with suspected CAD. The 139 \nmodel structure was developed following consultation with clinicians and 140 \nconsideration of the existing economic evaluation literature.(4)  141 \n 142 \nDecision Tree Model 143 \nThe DTM is a way of displaying the proper temporal and logical sequence of a 144 \nclinical decision problem.(8) In practical terms, it may take weeks or even months for 145 \na patient to go from the first decision node to the final diagnosis. 146 \n 147 \nThe tests considered in the DTM were SPECT, stress ECG and coronary angiography. 148 \nThese diagnostic tests were combined to produce the following strategies (thought, 149 \non the basis of the literature and clinical opinion, representative of current practice): 150 \na) Stress ECG; followed by SPECT if stress ECG positive or indeterminate; followed 151 \nby coronary angiography if SPECT positive \u2013high risk\u2013 result or indeterminate 152 \nb) Stress ECG; followed by coronary angiography if stress ECG positive or 153 \nindeterminate 154 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d  \n 8 \nc) SPECT; followed by coronary angiography if SPECT positive \u2013high risk\u2013 result or 155 \nindeterminate 156 \nd) Coronary Angiography (invasive test as first option). 157 \n 158 \nWithin the model (Figure 1) a patient may, for example, arrive in the hospital with 159 \ntypical chest pain. This is central chest discomfort often described as tightness, a 160 \nweight on the chest or a constricting band around the chest; usually not sharp in 161 \nnature and builds up and down slowly, varied in severity but lasts only a few 162 \nminutes, frequently radiates down the left arm, up into the neck or through to the 163 \nback. It can often be associated with cold sweat, breathlessness and tingling in the 164 \nhands and\/or fingers and pain would be relieved by resting. (Malcolm Metcalfe, 165 \npersonal communication, September 2006) 166 \n 167 \nTaking the patient\u2019s history and symptoms into account the physician must decide 168 \nbetween an invasive test (coronary angiography) and a non-invasive test as the first 169 \noption (stress ECG or SPECT). If the physician decides on an invasive test, then the 170 \npatient has a small risk of dying during the test. If the patient survives, then this will 171 \nresult in a final classification of their condition into one of three categories: High Risk 172 \n(i.e. three vessel disease and poor left ventricular function or left main disease); 173 \nMedium Risk (single or double vessel disease); or Low Risk, (no significant heart 174 \ndisease present).  175 \n 176 \nIf the physician opts for the non-invasive stress ECG test as the first option, and if the 177 \nresult of this test is positive, another non-invasive test, SPECT, could be requested. If 178 \nthe SPECT test result is positive this might result in a diagnosis of the patient as High 179 \nRisk or result in a request for a coronary angiography to help determine appropriate 180 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d \n 9 \nmanagement. A final outcome of this strategy for this particular patient would be if 181 \nthey receive a left main disease diagnosis following angiography and would be 182 \nclassified as High Risk. Similarly, if the SPECT results are negative then the physician 183 \nclassifies the patient as Low Risk. 184 \n 185 \nThere are three possible diagnoses and three possible disease states. However, as all 186 \nindividuals that have a positive result would eventually go to a further test, all those 187 \ndiagnosed as high risk must have gone through coronary angiography as their last 188 \ntest (if coronary angiography is not their first and only test). As the model assumed 189 \nperfect information from coronary angiography (i.e it is defined as a gold standard), 190 \nthere is no possibility of misclassifying patients identifies as being as high risk by a 191 \nnon-invasive test.   Thus, at the end of the Decision Tree a patient who has survived 192 \nthe diagnostic process will be in one of the following diagnostic situations: a) Low 193 \nRisk; b) Medium Risk; c) High Risk; d) classified as low risk but actually high risk 194 \n(false negative); e) classified as low risk but in fact medium risk (false negative); f) 195 \nclassified as medium risk but actually low risk (false positive); g) classified as 196 \nmedium risk but actually high risk. These outcomes represent the states in which the 197 \npatient will start in the Markov model described below. 198 \n 199 \nMarkov Model 200 \nThe Markov Model provides estimated costs and outcomes over a selected period of 201 \ntime (e.g. the expected lifetime) for cohort of patients for each of the different 202 \nmanagement strategies that could be adopted following diagnosis. A Markov Model 203 \nof the type presented here has states in which patients stay for a period of time called 204 \na \u2018cycle\u2019. The cycle must be a period of time relevant to the condition considered (in 205 \nthis case one year). At the end of the cycle, the individuals can remain in the state 206 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d  \n 10 \nthey started the cycle in, or they can move to a different state. The probabilities of 207 \nmoving from one state to another are called transition probabilities and these are 208 \ndefined below. Finally, in these models there must be at least one absorbing state 209 \nfrom which the patient will not be able to leave. In this model the absorbing state is 210 \n\u2018death\u2019 which can be reached from any of the other states. 211 \n 212 \nThese Markov model states can be thought of as comprising a number of events that 213 \ninfluence cost and outcome. For instance, patients entering a Medium Risk state 214 \n(Figure 2) will receive medical management and will enjoy a particular quality of life 215 \nduring the period of time they remain in that state. If a patient has a revascularisation 216 \nthe model will adjust costs and quality of life. Patients who receive and survive a 217 \nrevascularisation move to a revascularisation state in which they enjoy the benefits of 218 \nthe revascularisation (lower risk of death and MI) until the patient dies or it is felt the 219 \nbenefits of the revascularisation will no longer be obtained. A similar process can be 220 \ndescribed for the other states (Figure 2).  221 \n 222 \nInterventions and events considered within the model are: for all states medical 223 \nmanagement and myocardial infarction. In addition, revascularisation (PTCA or 224 \nCABG) is included for Low, Medium or High Risk states. For \u2019revascularisation\u2018 225 \nstates, further revascularisation is possible. Finally, within the \u2019false\u2018 states part of the 226 \ncohort may be re-diagnosed by coronary angiography. The assumption within the 227 \nmodel is that all survivors are correctly diagnosed after a maximum of 10 years 228 \nperiod either as a result of additional diagnostic tests or a non-fatal MI.  This 229 \nassumption reflects the belief that \u2018at risk\u2019 individuals would over time face other 230 \nopportunities, such as regular health checks, in which they may receive a correct 231 \ndiagnosis. 232 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d \n 11 \n 233 \nProbabilities 234 \nDecision Tree Model Probabilities 235 \nDecision tree probabilities were derived from the literature or calculated in the 236 \nmodel. Medline (1966-October 2002), EMBASE (1980- October 2002) and also PRE-237 \nMEDLINE and NHS-EED were searched with terms like \u2018coronary disease\u2019 or 238 \n\u2018myocardial ischemia\u2019 or \u2018angina pectoris\u2019 amongst others.  Further details of the 239 \nsearch strategy adopted are described in Mowatt and colleagues, Appendix 1.(4) 240 \n 241 \nThe prevalence of coronary heart disease (Table 1) was obtained from British Heart 242 \nFoundation Statistics.(1) Sensitivity and specificity data were obtained from Mowatt 243 \nand colleagues.(4) Mowatt and colleagues conducted a systematic review of 244 \ndiagnosis accuracy of SPECT, stress ECG and coronary angiography. This review 245 \nonly included studies that reported direct comparisons between the three tests as 246 \nopposed to other reviews that relied on indirect comparisons between studies.(9-17) 247 \nIn the review by Mowatt and colleagues angiography was taken as the reference 248 \nstandard. Sensitivity and specificity figures were determined by the interpretation by 249 \nthe research team of the results of the review of effectiveness. 250 \n 251 \nIn previous work it has been typically assumed that coronary angiography is the 252 \ngold standard (sensitivity and specificity equal to 1).(4, 12, 15) Although it is known 253 \nthat coronary angiography is not a reliable indicator of the functional significance of 254 \ncoronary stenosis (3, 18) this study has assumed perfect information from coronary 255 \nangiography but explored the issue in sensitivity analysis. 256 \n 257 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d  \n 12 \nUsing the prevalence data and data on sensitivity and specificity, positive and 258 \nnegative result rates were calculated for each diagnostic strategy. An assumption 259 \nwas made that sensitivity and specificity rates were independent of the underlying 260 \nprevalence of CAD.  Incorporation of these data into the DTM allowed positive and 261 \nnegative result rates to be calculated for diagnostic strategy at different pre-test risks 262 \nof CAD. 263 \n 264 \nMarkov Model Probabilities 265 \nThe time horizon for the Markov Model was 25 years and the transition probabilities 266 \nand their sources used in this model are presented in Table 1.  The risk of dying from 267 \nany of the states was calculated as the mortality rate for the corresponding age group 268 \nwith adjustments for the relative risk caused by the level of risk and beneficial effects 269 \nof medical or surgical treatment. The mortality rate for men and women for England 270 \nand Wales was based on general population estimates produced by the UK 271 \nGovernment\u2019s Actuary Department.(19) 272 \n 273 \nWithin the Markov model states were defined for both false negatives and false 274 \npositives. The model allows for an increasing proportion of misclassified patients to 275 \nbe allocated properly in each cycle. As described above, for the base case the 276 \ncomplete cohort of misclassified patients would be correctly allocated within 10 277 \nyears. 278 \n 279 \nThe risk of MI is considered for each state. The risk for the general population, used 280 \nfor the Low Risk state, was obtained from Lampe and colleagues 2000.(20) This is a 281 \nUK based prospective study to describe the long-term outcomes of ischemic heart 282 \ndisease that involved a sample of 7735 men aged 40 to 59. The relative risks for the 283 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d \n 13 \nother states were derived from the prospective USA based study by Shaw and 284 \ncolleagues 1999 (N=11,372).(21) These proportions were split into fatal and non-fatal 285 \nMI using data from Lampe and colleagues(20) and Volmink and colleagues 286 \n(population wide surveillance study based in Oxfordshire, UK) in order to correctly 287 \nre-diagnose those who had a non-fatal MI.(22) 288 \n 289 \nAnnual revascularisation risk in Medium and High risk states as well as risk of 290 \nsecond revascularisation when having PTCA or CABG were derived from Kuntz and 291 \ncolleagues.(12)  292 \n 293 \nCosts 294 \nDecision Tree Model Costs 295 \nTable 1 shows the interventions considered for the Decision and Markov model, the 296 \ncost in 2001\/02 pounds sterling, and the sources from where the figures were 297 \nobtained. 298 \n 299 \nThe total costs for stress ECG and coronary angiography were \u00a3105(23) and 300 \n\u00a31310.(24)  The cost of stress ECG was calculated from HRG V05 category.(25)  It is 301 \nAdmission and Emergency direct cost plus a share of support services (pathology 302 \nand radiology) and has been calculated in a top-down approach. 303 \n 304 \nThe cost of SPECT came from Underwood and colleagues.(24)  Their figures were 305 \nderived by averaging 1996 data for UK centres and Royal Brompton Hospital, 306 \nLondon, which was judged to be the most meaningful by the authors. These costs 307 \nwere estimated using a very detailed bottom-up costing exercise where all resources 308 \nwere itemised and costed (personal communication, Professor Underwood, February 309 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d  \n 14 \n2003). The cost estimate was checked with an estimate derived using a top-down 310 \napproach with data from different sources, which confirm the figures from the 311 \nEMPIRE study.(24) The costs reported by Underwood and colleagues were inflated 312 \nusing the Hospital and Community Health Services (HCHS) Pay and Prices 313 \nIndex.(26)  314 \n 315 \nMarkov Model Costs 316 \nFor the different Risk states three interventions were considered: medical 317 \nmanagement, MI event management and revascularisation.  Medical management 318 \ncost for the different states was obtained from experts\u2019 opinion and checked with the 319 \nliterature. It was found that the final figure did not differ much from the one 320 \npresented by Sculpher and colleagues.(27) Prices for this calculation were obtained 321 \nfrom the British National Formulary.(28) MI event management cost data came from 322 \nBoland and colleagues(29), who used NHS Reference Costs(25); figures for 2001\/02 323 \nfrom the same source were used in this model. 324 \n 325 \nThe cost for PTCA was \u00a31994(23); the calculation assumed 60 minutes of theatre time, 326 \nand an angiography performed immediately prior to the PTCA. The calculation 327 \nallowed for the staff cost of five healthcare professionals as well as relevant 328 \nconsumables plus capital items. The cost for CABG was obtained from NHS 329 \nReference Costs.(25)  Where appropriate estimates were adjusted for inflation using 330 \nHCHS Pay and Prices Index.(26) 331 \n 332 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d \n 15 \nQuality of life measures 333 \nOne of the products of the economic evaluation is quality adjusted life years 334 \n(QALYs).  QALYs combine estimates of survival time and the quality of that survival 335 \ntime. Survival is provided by the cumulative number of cycles spent in each state of 336 \nthe model other than Death. Taking the time spent in each state and weighting it by a 337 \nquality of life score provided an estimate of QALYs. 338 \n 339 \nEstimates of QALYs were required for each of the states in the Markov model.  The 340 \nbest data for estimation of this, given the perspective of the evaluation, would be UK 341 \nstudies with generic health status measures such as those provided by tools such as 342 \nthe EQ 5D.(30) In the absence of such data information was sought from a review of 343 \nrelated economic evaluations(4) and from the Cost Effectiveness Analyses 344 \nRegistry.(31) While relatively comprehensive, the data presented in the registry were 345 \nmethodologically no better (and more often of lower quality) than the results of the 346 \nstandard gamble exercise used by Kuntz and colleagues(12) identified by a review of 347 \neconomic evaluations. The utility scores used in the model are described in Table 1. 348 \n 349 \nIt was assumed in the Markov Model that patients who have an MI or are 350 \nrevascularised will lose part of their QALYs as a result of the event and will recover 351 \ntheir previous level of quality of life in three months (Table 1).(32) The gain from 352 \nrevascularisation is the subsequent lower risk of death but not a higher quality of life 353 \nthan before revascularisation. 354 \n 355 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d  \n 16 \nData analysis 356 \nThe parameters for costs of interventions, risks of events and quality of life for the 357 \nbase case analysis were entered in decision tree and Markov models. Payoffs for the 358 \ndecision tree model were obtained from the Markov models run for up to 25 cycles 359 \n(i.e., 25 years follow-up period). The starting age for the hypothetical cohort of 360 \npatients was 60 years. Annual discount rates of 6% and 1.5% were used for costs and 361 \noutcomes, respectively.(33) The costs and effects were re-estimated for different 362 \nvalues of prevalence of disease: 10.5% (baseline), 30%, 50% and 85%. The baseline 363 \nrate was calculated using data from the British Heart Foundation Statistics and is an 364 \nestimation of the mean population CHD prevalence. Lower levels of prevalence were 365 \nexplored in sensitivity analyses. 366 \n 367 \nSensitivity Analysis 368 \nManning and colleagues (5) developed a taxonomy of uncertainty in economic 369 \nevaluations. They distinguished between \u2018Modelling uncertainty\u2019 from \u2018parameter 370 \nuncertainty\u2019: the first could be further differentiated into uncertainty due to model 371 \nstructure and uncertainty due to the overall process of the cost-effectiveness analysis. 372 \nParameter uncertainty refers to those cases where the parameters could not be 373 \nobserved, for which there are disagreement about their appropriate values, or how 374 \nthey could change in the future (epidemiology of the disease), sampling variability, 375 \nor values of parameters to feed the model for alternative settings. 376 \n 377 \nProbabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to address parameter uncertainty. The 378 \nimportance of this has been stressed elsewhere.(5, 34, 35) Prior probability 379 \ndistributions to allow for uncertainty in the mean parameters values were specified 380 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d \n 17 \nfollowing usual practice (34, 36) and are shown in Table 1.  Detailed information on 381 \ncosts was limited, nonetheless as a mean and range were available triangular 382 \ndistributions for costs were used.  For proportions, beta distributions were used (i.e. 383 \nsensitivity or specificity of diagnosis tests).(37) Gamma distributions were used for 384 \nprobabilities that were very near to zero (i.e. death during an ECG test)(Alan 385 \nBrennan, personal communication, April 2004)(38) and lognormal distributions were 386 \nused for relative risks (i.e. relative risk of death for High Risk patients).(35) 387 \n 388 \nOne thousand Monte Carlo simulation iterations were obtained for the Markov 389 \nPayoff Model. These results were used as probability distributions for the payoffs in 390 \nthe Decision Tree Model. Monte Carlo Simulation was then performed in the 391 \nDecision Tree Model using the Excel added on Crystal Ball software.(6, 39)  392 \n 393 \nThese results were used for calculating credible intervals for the deterministic results 394 \npresented in Table 2 and for constructing cost-effectiveness acceptability curves 395 \n(CEACs). CEACs detail the probability that the intervention is optimal for any 396 \nmaximum value that the Decision Maker would be willing to pay (Ceiling Ratio) for 397 \nan extra unit of effectiveness (in our case for an extra QALY).(40) 398 \n 399 \nWhile probabilistic sensitivity analysis allow us to know how precise the results in 400 \nthe model are, it could potentially give us a very precise wrong answer if the data 401 \nused as inputs, in this case sensitivity and specificity of the tests, for instance, were 402 \npotentially biased. Therefore, probabilistic sensitivity analysis was combined with 403 \nother forms of sensitivity analysis.  Mowatt and colleagues(4) stated that there was 404 \nheterogeneity between the studies that provided data on the specificity or sensitivity 405 \nof the tests. Figures from some of these studies were used to address this potential 406 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d  \n 18 \nproblem.  A similar problem also limited previous economic evaluations identified 407 \nby the systematic review of economic evaluations(4), although it has not previously 408 \nbeen elucidated. Furthermore, the uncertainty surrounding estimates of sensitivity 409 \nand specificity used in earlier studies has been further compounded by potential 410 \nbiases caused by the indirect comparisons used. 411 \n 412 \nOther sensitivity analysis was also conducted. First the time horizon over which costs 413 \nand effects are considered was varied from 25 to 10 and 5 years, as it may be 414 \nunrealistic to assume that costs and outcomes over such a long period can be reliably 415 \nestimated. Second, the period in which false negatives are correctly re-diagnosed has 416 \nbeen modified from the maximum of 10 years assumed for the base case. Third, 417 \nalternative data for the likelihood that a test was indeterminate were used.(12) Kuntz 418 \nand colleagues assume higher values for ECG indeterminacy (30% vs. 18% base case) 419 \nand lower value for SPECT indeterminacy (2% vs. 9% base case). Fourth, the analysis 420 \nwas repeated with a \u00a325 and \u00a3225 cost for stress ECG, \u00a3128 and \u00a3340 cost for SPECT, 421 \nand \u00a3895 and \u00a31724 cost for coronary angiography based on data from Mowatt and 422 \ncolleagues.(4)  Finally, a sub-group analysis for female cohort has been performed 423 \nwhich took data suggesting a lower prevalence of disease and slightly higher 424 \nsensitivity and specificity for SPECT.(4)   425 \n 426 \nAverage costs were used as the basis of estimates of costs for the diagnostic tests 427 \nused. Such costs include elements for the capital and overheads of providing these 428 \nservices.  As there may be concerns that they do not adequately reflect opportunity 429 \ncosts, the impact of using these costs was also explored in the sensitivity analysis. 430 \n 431 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d \n 19 \nThe generalisability of this analysis could be undermined due to exclusion of 432 \npotentially relevant strategies for other settings. Particularly relevant seems to be the 433 \ncase of Echocardiography (ECHO) that appear to be a cost-effective option in 434 \nprevious studies.(12) Further sensitivity analysis was conducted and two strategies 435 \nwere added to the original model. Namely, ECHO followed by coronary 436 \nangiography if ECHO positive result, and ECHO followed by SPECT if ECHO 437 \npositive result, followed by coronary angiography if SPECT high-risk diagnostic 438 \nresult. Data needed to feed the model added strategies were obtained from Kuntz 439 \nand colleagues(12) for ECHO sensitivity, specificity, and assumed the same 440 \nindeterminacy and mortality rates as ECG(15), and probability distributions were 441 \nattached for probabilistic analysis (Table 1). 442 \n 443 \nThe prevalence rates used for the base case analysis might be considered high 444 \naccording to some sources.(41) This also could potentially undermine the 445 \ngeneralisability and practical use of this study results to other settings. The original 446 \nmodel was run for lower prevalence rates (e.g. 0.1%, 0.5%, 1% and 5%) as part of the 447 \nsensitivity analysis. 448 \n 449 \nFinally, it is known that coronary angiography is not a reliable indicator of the 450 \nfunctional significance of coronary stenosis(3, 18). Therefore, an additional 451 \nprobabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed assigning further probability 452 \ndistributions to the sensitivity and specificity of coronary angiography. Beta 453 \ndistributions were used with mean 0.99 and standard deviation of 0.005 for both 454 \nparameters. 455 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d  \n 20 \nRESULTS 456 \nBase case analyses 457 \nTable 2 show the deterministic results of the base case analysis and a range of 458 \ndifferent prevalence rates. As prevalence increases, cost increases and QALYs 459 \ndecrease.  At all prevalence levels the order of the strategies remain the same. This 460 \ntable also shows the incremental cost per QALY. This outcome is based upon 461 \ndiagnostic and treatment costs (obtained from the payoff model) and estimated 462 \nQALYs.  As a consequence, the incremental cost per QALY is driven, not only by 463 \ndiagnostic performance, but also the costs and consequences of management 464 \nstrategies chosen on the basis of diagnostic information.  465 \n 466 \nFor a prevalence of 10.5% the incremental cost per QALY gained (ICER) for the move 467 \nfrom SPECT-coronary angiography strategy to coronary angiography strategy is 468 \n\u00a348,600.  ECG-SPECT-coronary angiography and SPECT-coronary angiography 469 \nstrategies have extended dominance over the ECG-coronary angiography strategy 470 \n(i.e. managing patients with a combination of ECG-SPECT-coronary angiography 471 \nand SPECT-coronary angiography would result in a lower incremental cost per 472 \nQALY than managing all patients with the ECG-coronary angiography strategy 473 \nalone).  This is because the ICER for movement from ECG-SPECT-coronary 474 \nangiography to ECG-coronary angiography (\u00a326,249) is higher than going from ECG-475 \ncoronary angiography to SPECT-coronary angiography (\u00a39261)). The ICER without 476 \nthe extended dominated strategy is \u00a315,241.  477 \n 478 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d \n 21 \nAt a 30% prevalence level the order of the strategies is the same but the ICERs 479 \nassociated with movement between the strategies fall. The situation of extended 480 \ndominance described above persists.  481 \n 482 \nAt a prevalence level of 50% the ICER for moving from ECG-SPECT-coronary 483 \nangiography to ECG-coronary angiography was \u00a32473; from ECG-coronary 484 \nangiography to SPECT-coronary angiography was \u00a34032 and from SPECT-coronary 485 \nangiography to coronary angiography strategy \u00a33372. In this case the ECG-coronary 486 \nangiography and coronary angiography strategies have extended dominance over 487 \nthe SPECT-coronary angiography strategy (ICER: \u00a35,200). Finally, for an 85% 488 \nprevalence level the ICERs for the movement between strategies are further reduced 489 \nand ECG-coronary angiography and coronary angiography strategies continue to 490 \nhave extended dominance over the SPECT-coronary angiography strategy.  491 \n 492 \n[Table 2 Estimated costs and outcomes for each diagnostic strategy] [HERE] 493 \n 494 \n Sensitivity Analysis 495 \nFrom the probabilistic sensitivity analysis credible limits for costs and QALYs for 496 \neach strategy were obtained (Table 2). From these data, it was not immediately 497 \nobvious if one strategy could dominate any of the others. Therefore, the probabilistic 498 \nresults were presented in a series of CEACs (Figure 3). 499 \n 500 \nIn the base case analysis ECG-coronary angiography strategy is highly unlikely to be 501 \noptimal (Figure 3a). Moreover, if the decision maker is willing to pay less than \u00a38000 502 \nfor a QALY the strategy with higher probability of being optimal is ECG-SPECT-503 \ncoronary angiography. At approximately \u00a39000 per QALY, ECG-SPECT-coronary 504 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d  \n 22 \nangiography and SPECT-coronary angiography strategies have a similar probability 505 \nof being optimal.  At ceiling ratio of \u00a320,000 SPECT-coronary angiography has a 90% 506 \nlikelihood of being considered the more cost effective option, but beyond this value, 507 \nthe likelihood falls such that at willingness to pay values over \u00a375,000 coronary 508 \nangiography is the strategy most likely to be optimal. 509 \n 510 \nAt a 30% prevalence of disease (Figure 3b), strategies that involve SPECT seem to be 511 \noptimal for decision makers willingness to pay for a QALY of up to \u00a320,000; coronary 512 \nangiography being the optimal strategy decision for higher values of willingness to 513 \npay for a QALY. For higher levels of prevalence of disease and for a threshold of 514 \nmore than a \u00a310,000 per QALY, coronary angiography is the optimal decision (Figure 515 \n3c and 3d). 516 \n 517 \nOn the basis of sensitivity analysis on the model parameters (not reported) the model 518 \nresults were found to be more sensitive to the prevalence of disease (Figure 3) and 519 \ntests performance. The values used in the model for sensitivity and specificity of tests 520 \nwere similar to those used in previous studies.(12) If other central values than those 521 \nused in the base case were chosen the model might produce very different results. As 522 \nthere was known to be heterogeneity in the data other sources of specificity and 523 \nsensitivity data were used for ECG and SPECT. These data were based on De and 524 \ncolleagues(42) as an example of a scenario where SPECT performs poorly and from 525 \nMichaelides and colleagues(43) for a well performing SPECT scenario. As expected, 526 \nin the worst SPECT performance scenario, SPECT-coronary angiography strategy did 527 \nnot appear in the frontier of optimal solutions for any level of prevalence of disease, 528 \nwhile ECG-SPECT-coronary angiography strategy appears optimal for 10.5% 529 \nprevalence of disease and when the threshold is less than \u00a35,000. Using data from 530 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d \n 23 \nMichaelides and colleagues gave similar results to those presented in the base case 531 \n(Figure 3).  It should be noted that even for this most optimistic scenario, at a level of 532 \nprevalence higher than 60% and a threshold over \u00a316,000 per QALY, the coronary 533 \nangiography strategy appears to be the optimal diagnostic strategy. 534 \n 535 \nWith respect to changes in the time horizon adopted for the analysis, it was found 536 \nthat as the time horizon reduces the incremental cost per QALY increases.  This is 537 \nbecause the costs of initial diagnosis and treatment are not offset by survival and 538 \nquality of life gains.  Increasing the likelihood that misdiagnoses will be rectified 539 \nreduces the penalty associated with making a false negative diagnosis (i.e. it 540 \nimproves the cost-effectiveness of non-invasive strategies compared with coronary 541 \nangiography).  With respect to use of the higher values for ECG indeterminacy and 542 \nlower value for SPECT indeterminacy it was found that SPECT strategies were more 543 \nlikely to be considered cost-effective.  The results of the analysis were relatively 544 \ninsensitive to the alternative cost data used and to the changes considered in the 545 \nprobability distributions for the sensitivity and specificity of coronary angiography 546 \nsensitivity and specificity.  Furthermore, for the sub-group analysis restricted to 547 \nwomen it was found that the results were slightly more favourable to SPECT based 548 \nstrategies.  549 \n 550 \nWhen strategies involving ECHO were added to the model using data from 551 \nKuntz(12), they were shown to be potentially cost-effective options. Furthermore, at a 552 \n10.5% prevalence of CAD, ECHO-SPECT-coronary angiography strategy dominated 553 \nboth ECG-SPECT-coronary angiography and ECG-SPECT strategies, while ECHO-554 \ncoronary angiography dominated both ECG-coronary angiography and SPECT-555 \ncoronary angiography strategies.   556 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d  \n 24 \n 557 \nAt low levels of prevalence of CAD up to 1%, the strategy ECG-SPECT-coronary 558 \nangiography dominated all others, for prevalences between 1% and 4%  SPECT 559 \nbased strategies dominated non-SPECT based strategies while at 5% only SPECT-560 \ncoronary angiography strategy dominated coronary angiography strategy. 561 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d \n 25 \nDISCUSSION 562 \n 563 \nThis analysis indicates that it is possible that the incremental cost per unit of QALY 564 \nfor the move from stress ECG-SPECT-coronary angiography to SPECT-coronary 565 \nangiography might be considered worthwhile when the prevalence of CAD is below 566 \n30%. A combination of ECG-SPECT-coronary angiography and SPECT-coronary 567 \nangiography strategies would be more efficient than a reliance on a strategy of ECG-568 \ncoronary angiography only at these levels of prevalence of disease. Probabilistic 569 \nsensitivity analysis suggests that the ECG-coronary angiography strategy is highly 570 \nunlikely to be the most cost effective and does not form part of the cost-effectiveness 571 \nefficiency frontier described by the CEACs. The coronary angiography option is 572 \nmore likely to be considered optimal at high levels of prevalence of disease (>30%), 573 \nbut at lower levels of prevalence of disease, SPECT-coronary angiography strategy is 574 \nmore likely to be considered optimal. This result should be compared with the 575 \ndeterministic studies, which frequently concluded that strategies including SPECT 576 \nwere the most cost-effective. However, there is no consensus in the literature on 577 \nwhich strategy was more cost-effective. For example, three studies compared SPECT-578 \ncoronary angiography and stress ECG-SPECT-coronary angiography and two 579 \nconcluded that stress ECG-SPECT-coronary angiography was cost-effective(13, 24) 580 \nand one reported that the extra benefits provided by SPECT-coronary angiography 581 \nmight be worth its additional cost.(44)  582 \n 583 \nThe model considered some of the strategies that are potentially relevant for 584 \nmanaging CAD patients.  The effectiveness data for the diagnostic tests came from a 585 \nsystematic review of diagnostic and prognostic studies conducted by Mowatt and 586 \ncolleagues.(4)  However, little data were available from the UK. As a result data from 587 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d  \n 26 \nother countries were used, much of which came from studies conducted in the USA. 588 \nIn these cases, relative risks and rates of utilisation were extrapolated but absolute 589 \nrates of utilisation of interventions were not, as it is well known that there are 590 \ndifferences in utilisation rates between the USA and UK and it was believed that the 591 \nuse of relative rates would result in less bias. 592 \n  593 \nPositron emission tomography (PET) or stress Echocardiography (ECHO) 594 \ninterventions were not included in the original model. Other economic evaluations 595 \nhave shown PET as being unlikely to be cost-effective(4) and for the UK and other 596 \ncountries it has very limited availability.  ECHO is, however, a potentially relevant 597 \nalternative and its omission from the original analysis represents a limitation of the 598 \nstudy.  Evidence suggests that this approach may be a viable alternative(4) but it was 599 \nexcluded by NICE from their consideration of this technology (which the research 600 \npresented in this paper was originally commissioned to inform).  Then, ECHO based 601 \nstrategies were explored in sensitivity analysis and, using data from Kuntz(12) they 602 \nshow to be potentially cost effective options. However, these results should be 603 \ntreated with caution as the data on sensitivity and specificity used were based on an 604 \nad-hoc review of the literature and indirect test comparisons. The other sensitivity 605 \nand specificity data for the other tests were based on systematic review that included 606 \nstudies with direct test comparisons, and a meta analysis. Moreover, Mowatt and 607 \ncolleagues(4)  sensitivities and specificities for the other tests show to be lower than 608 \nthose observed in the article by Kuntz and colleagues.(12) This would tend to 609 \nmagnify the favorable results obtained for ECHO.  610 \n 611 \nThe \u2018do nothing\u2019 strategy was not considered in the model. This option might be 612 \nrelevant to a situation where diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical examination 613 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d \n 27 \nonly. Generally, some form of diagnostic testing is performed within the UK, as well 614 \nas in other settings, and as a result this option was judged to be inappropriate for this 615 \nevaluation. 616 \n 617 \nIn the base case model it was assumed that those patients who were not correctly 618 \nclassified would be correctly diagnosed within 10 years. If the assumed period were 619 \nshorter, then those strategies that result in incorrect diagnoses would not be as 620 \nheavily penalised, and ECG-coronary angiography strategy, for instance, would 621 \nperform better. 622 \n 623 \nThe model allows for indeterminate results in ECG and SPECT but it does not allow 624 \nfor a second ECG or SPECT test after indeterminacy. Moreover, complications due to 625 \nany of the tests were not considered and hence there were no quality of life 626 \nadjustment for these. This might be a potentially significant caveat as the 627 \ncomplications from coronary angiography (i.e. stroke) are likely to be more 628 \nimportant than in the other tests. This would tend to reduce the cost-effectiveness of 629 \nthose strategies that make the most use of coronary angiography. 630 \n 631 \nAs was stated above, the main results showed that key parameters in this model 632 \nwere prevalence of disease and tests performance. Sensitivity analyses were carried 633 \nout considering prevalence rates below the base case analysis rates (10.5%) according 634 \nto professional guidelines medium and low risk rate stratification.(41) The model 635 \nresults are in line with those professional bodies recommendations. In other words, a 636 \nstepwise approach with less invasive test as first option followed by more invasive 637 \nones in comparison with a more invasive test as first option.  638 \n 639 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d  \n 28 \nThe values for sensitivity and specificities for SPECT and ECG in this study are lower 640 \nthan those presented elsewhere.(41) The data used here are based on a more robust 641 \napproach as they are based on studies that made direct comparisons between the 642 \ndiagnostic tests.(4) This approach might lead to less data being included as a more 643 \nrestrictive inclusion criteria is used, but has higher internal validity.  Despite our best 644 \nefforts to obtain high quality data for sensitivities and specificities the results were 645 \nstill uncertain.  In our analysis this uncertainty has been modelled in two ways.  646 \nFirstly, statistical distributions have been defined for these variables and the effect of 647 \nusing these distributions has been estimated in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis.  648 \nSecondly, we have explored the use of fundamentally different values for these 649 \nparameters in best case and worst case scenarios.  The results of these analyses were 650 \nas expected.  For the worst SPECT scenario non-SPECT strategies represented the 651 \noptimal decision, but it should be noted that the accuracy of SPECT reported in De 652 \nand colleagues, used in the worst case scenario for SPECT, is quite different from that 653 \nshown by other studies.(4) Using data from Michaelides and colleagues(43) as an 654 \nexample of best SPECT performance scenario provided similar results to the base 655 \ncase analysis.  However, for high level of prevalence of disease (>60%) the coronary 656 \nangiography strategy appears to be the optimal decision.  657 \n 658 \nConclusions about the role of coronary angiography might change if the assumption 659 \nis not made that coronary angiography is a gold standard.  It is very difficult to 660 \nassess the effect of relaxing this assumption as the sensitivity and specificity of the 661 \nother tests would need adjusting as they are compared to coronary angiography.  662 \nFurthermore, it is possible that SPECT might have independent prognostic value 663 \nover coronary angiography.(45)  The sensitivity analysis that was conducted was 664 \nunable to fully address these issues but as it reduced the performance of coronary 665 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d \n 29 \nangiography compared with the other tests it can be thought of as reflecting a worst 666 \ncase situation for the performance of coronary angiography.  Nonetheless, results 667 \nwere insensitive to the changes to considered. 668 \n 669 \nLinking diagnostic performance to long-term outcomes required a number of 670 \nassumptions to be made about both the structure of the model and its parameters.  671 \nSome of these assumptions were based on a limited evidence base and it is unclear 672 \nwhether these data are applicable to the UK or to other settings.  Furthermore, due to 673 \nthe absence of data, the model presented does not allow for higher quality of life 674 \nafter revascularisation. Therefore, the benefits of revascularisation are derived solely 675 \nfrom higher life expectancy.  If a higher quality of life were achieved after 676 \nrevascularisation, those strategies that accurately identify patients for 677 \nrevascularisation (fewer false negatives) would perform better.  678 \n 679 \nA further caveat, related to the pay-off model, is the extent to which severity of 680 \ndisease is linked to quality of life.  The model presented, and many of the previous 681 \nevaluations, makes the assumption that there is a direct link.  No utility data were 682 \nidentified with which to test this assumption and, therefore, further research is 683 \nrequired on this area. 684 \n 685 \nFinally, the adoption of SPECT based strategies might reduce the necessary time for 686 \ndiagnosis as in some countries the waiting time from a positive stress ECG result to a 687 \ncoronary angiography may be considerable. In the UK, for instance, this waiting time 688 \nis currently about 20 weeks.(4)  The increase use of SPECT in rapid access clinics 689 \ncould reduce the distress associated with this wait. Moreover, within the UK and 690 \nother countries SPECT may possibly not be as widely available as stress ECG.  691 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d  \n 30 \nTherefore, patients who require SPECT may need to travel and to support the time 692 \nand financial costs associated with this. Clearly, the expansion of SPECT-based 693 \nservices would require considerable investment in infrastructure. Although the cost 694 \nof this expansion might be important, the lack of trained staff could be a greater 695 \nobstacle. In the UK, for instance, this trained staff expansion would take between 5 696 \nand 10 years.(4)   697 \n 698 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d \n 31 \nCONCLUSIONS 699 \n 700 \nStrategies that involve the use of SPECT seem to be optimal for low levels of 701 \nprevalence of CHD and should they be adopted this would reduce the number of 702 \ninvasive tests required. Although this higher use may be efficient, the expansion of 703 \nservices may be slow, because of the time needed to train staff adequately. For high 704 \nlevels of prevalence of CHD, the result seems to be the opposite; namely, strategies 705 \nthat do not involve SPECT seem to be optimal. Finally, future research should 706 \nacknowledge that determining the optimal diagnosis strategy requires information 707 \non longer-term outcomes, especially on rates of service utilisation and on utilities. 708 \nSensitivity analyses show strategies that involved ECHO as potentially cost-effective 709 \noptions. Further research to assess the relative cost-effectiveness of ECHO should 710 \nalso be performed. 711 \nHern\u00e1ndez, R.; Vale, L. : \u201dThe value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy\u2026\u201d  \n 32 \nReferences 712 \n1.
