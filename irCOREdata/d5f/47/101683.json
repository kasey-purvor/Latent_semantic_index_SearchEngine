Whether elements designed for tourists are perceived \nfavourably is open to question. However, it seems that the question about how tourists \nthemselves perceive and evaluate such touristic characteristics has so far received little \nattention. The aim of this study is to propose a theoretical framework and methods to \ninvestigate visitors\u2019 evaluation, with specific reference to the relations between visitors\u2019 \nmental states and features of an historical district.  \nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK \nFollowing a consideration of historical districts, the structure of visitors\u2019 \nevaluations of tourism destinations is explored with reference to concepts of cognitive \ncomponents, affective components, and visitors\u2019 mental states such as wants, needs and \nvalues. This then provides the background for the research methods, a combination of \nRepertory Grid Analysis and Laddering Analysis.  \nThe Complex Nature of Visitors\u2019 Evaluations of an Historical District \n The geographical forms of historical districts are diverse. In contrast to \nhistorical attractions dispersed around a large area, those clustered in a specific district \nmay form what Ashworth and Tunbridge (2000) described as an \u201chistorical gem\u201d (p.156), \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  5\nwhere historic resources are \u201cdramatic, complete and also . . . valued\u201d (p.156).  The term \n\u201chistorical district\u201d is employed here in this sense to mean a focus or tight cluster. That is, \nan historical district is understood to be a cluster of historical buildings where not only the \nindividual units themselves but also their concentrated continuity is valued as heritage. \nAlthough historical districts have been described as places that offer opportunities \nfor visitors to appreciate the past (Lynch, 1972; Millar, 1989; Moscardo, 2000), some \nauthors have argued (Caffyn & Lutz, 1999; Johnson, 1999; Palmer, 1999) that heritage \nattractions do not always reflect real past events and history, and may even be false or \nsuperficial. Indeed, it is often claimed that tourism and commercialisation are usually in \nan inseparable relation (Richards, 1996; Urry, 1990). This is also argued to be the case for \nheritage tourism (Adorno, 1991; Ashworth, 1991; Ashworth & Voogt, 1990, 1994; \nHewison, 1987; McKercher & du Cros, 2002). In tourism studies, such \ncommercialisation has been criticised for transforming historical settings into superficial \nobjects for the sake of tourism (Boorstin, 1964; Halewood & Hannam, 2001; MacCannell, \n1976; Mathieson & Wall, 1982; Walsh, 1992). \nWhile the commercialisation of historical towns has been criticised, some \nresearchers argue that complete authenticity may not be required to attract tourists \n(Ashworth & Voogt, 1990; Caffyn & Lutz, 1999). Indeed, visitors may not even be \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  6\nconcerned about authenticity or may need a certain degree of familiarity to enjoy unusual \nexperiences (Cohen, 1972; Goss, 1993; Hashimoto, 1999; Krippendorf, 1984) and many \nvisitors demand contemporary facilities (Ashworth, 1988; Ashworth & Tunbridge, 2000).  \nMany historical districts are currently major centres of visitation. However, the \nexistence of tourists, especially in a specific non tourist-oriented area, has often been \nregarded negatively in that they take up space (Misham, 1969) and consume perceptual \ncapacity related to the subjective quality of visitors\u2019 experience (Walter, 1982). In \npsychology, crowding, which is a psychological stress that sometimes accompanies high \npopulation density (Stokols, 1972), has been seen to detract from desired tourist \nexperience (Schreyer & Roggenbuck, 1978; West, 1982; Womble & Studebaker, 1981).    \nAlthough the negative impact of the existence of others should not be overlooked, \nits meaning needs further deliberation. As Urry (1990) has argued, an historical tourism \nobject is basically regarded as the object of \u201cromantic gaze\u201d in which solitude, privacy \nand a personal, semi-spiritual relationship is appreciated. However, it is worth noting that \nsuch a district could have been in the past or may still be a residential or commercial area. \nIn this sense, an historical district itself could be regarded as the object of the collective \ngaze, in which the presence of other people is necessary to give atmosphere to the \nexperience of a place. Some theories go so far as to suggest that crowding in certain \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  7\nsituations may be exhilarating or arousing (Argyle, Furnham & Graham, 1981; Hull, \n1990) or may be perceived as contributory to social affiliation (Ditton, Fedler & Graefe, \n1983 cited in Manning, 1985; Graham & Burge, 1984).  \nOn account of these arguments, it is suggested that visitors\u2019 evaluations of an \nhistorical district cannot be understood simply within the bipolar framework of \n\u201cfavourable\u201d or \u201cunfavourable\u201d, and are likely to relate to several evaluative dimensions, \nsuch as the place\u2019s spiritual value, or the sense of stillness or stimulation, according to \nvisitors\u2019 mental states. For instance, in tourism, differences in levels of demand for \nfamiliarity among different individuals (Cohen, 1972, 1979; Plog, 1973; Smith, 1977) or \nwithin the same individual (Naoi, 2003) have been considered. Visitors\u2019 evaluations of an \nhistorical district can also vary according to such inter- and intra-personal differences.  \nIn consideration of these arguments, it is suggested that visitors\u2019 evaluations of an \nhistorical district require methods that are able to elicit complex and delicate relations \nbetween variables. \nThe structure of visitors\u2019 evaluations of a tourism destination \nIn this section, discussion of the psychological structure of visitors\u2019 evaluation is \nattempted in order to lay foundations for the research methods.  \nTheories and findings from studies of tourism destination image provide useful \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  8\nguides. It is observed that destination image has been described as related to the \nsubjective mental views that people have of a place, such as beliefs (Chon, 1990; Hunt, \n1971; Kotler, 1982), ideas (Chon, 1990; Kotler, 1982), impressions (Chon, 1990; Kotler, \n1982; Milman & Pizam, 1995), visual or mental impression (Lawson & Baud-Bovy, \n1977), expectation (Chon, 1990), and emotional thoughts (Lawson & Baud-Bovy, 1977). \nIt seems from these descriptions that a concept of destination image is somehow similar \nto visitors\u2019 evaluation of a place in the sense that both are concerned with how people \nsubjectively think about a place. Hence knowledge of tourism destination image provides \nan important ingredient of the theoretical framework.  \nIn the studies of tourism destination image, two components have emerged as \nsignificant: cognitive and affective (Baloglu, 1999, 2000, 2001; Baloglu & McCleary, \n1999a, 1999b; Gartner, 1993; Walmsley & Jenkins, 1993; Young, 1995). Cognitive \ncomponents relate to the physical features (Hanyu, 1993) and can be regarded as derived \nfrom fact (Boulding, 1956). In contrast, affective components are concerned with the \nemotional quality of destination (Hanyu, 1993). A number of authors point to the link \nbetween these two in that affective components are derived from cognitive components \n(Crompton & Ankomah, 1993; Gartner, 1993; Lynch, 1960; Mayo & Jarvis, 1981; Russel \n& Pratt, 1980; Woodside & Lysonski, 1989).  \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  9\nIt can also be claimed that there are hierarchical relations between cognitive and \naffective components, and mental states. In marketing studies, Gutman (1982) proposed a \nmeans-end chain model, which refers to the idea that attributes of an object are means to \nachieve certain objectives, which are then the means to achieve more ultimate objectives \nor satisfy values. His model illustrates the hierarchical ladder-like relationship between \nphysical attributes at the bottom of the ladder, several levels of goal-oriented mental \nstates that indicate concrete desirable actions in the middle, and higher level abstract \nmental states at the top. Although Gutman (1982) did not use the concepts of cognitive \nand affective components, the attributes illustrated in an example provided by Reynolds \nand Gutman (1988) include some cognitive components, such as \u201csparkling taste\u201d and \naffective components, such as \u201crefreshing\u201d. It seems that their results revealed some \nrelations between cognitive and affective components, such as between \u201cfancy label\u201d and \n\u201cmore feminine\u201d, between affective components and mental states, such as between \n\u201csophisticated image\u201d and \u201cimpress others\u201d, and between cognitive components and \nmental states, such as between \u201csmaller size\u201d and \u201cavoid waste\u201d.    \nVisitors\u2019 mental states can further be grouped according to their concreteness. \n\u201cWant\u201d, which is defined as \u201cinternal forces that prompt behavior toward solutions\u201d \n(Cohen, 1981, p. 200), or which \u201carises from the discrepancy between actual and desired \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  10\nstates of being\u201d (Foxall, Goldsmith & Brown, 1998) is usually placed at the most concrete \nend. A \u201cwant\u201d is usually regarded as a manifestation of \u201cneed\u201d (Solomon, Bamossy & \nAskegaard 1999; Foxall et al, 1998). A concept of \u201cvalue\u201d is usually placed at the very \nabstract end, and is defined as \u201ca belief about a desirable end-state that transcends \nspecific situations and guides selection of behaviour\u201d (Solomon, et al. 1999, p. 104) or is \nargued to influence \u201cthe selection from available modes, means and ends of action\u201d \n(Kluckholn as cited in Markin, 1977, p. 119). These definitions suggest that wants are \nmanifested by needs, which are further based on more abstract values. In other words, \nthere could be a hierarchical relationship between these components.  \nThe possible hierarchical relations are summarised as in Figure 1. \nFIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE \nRelations between cognitive and affective components have been identified in past \nstudies, and relations between cognitive or affective components and mental states were \nimplied by means-ends theory. Hierarchical relations between wants, needs and values \nhave also been previously implied. These possible relations are to be investigated through \nRepertory Grid Analysis and Laddering Analysis, as explained later. It should also be \nnoted that there could be some relations between components belonging to the same level, \nfor example between affective components such as \u201cmore feminine\u201d and \u201csophisticated \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  11\nimage\u201d (Reynolds & Gutman, 1988).  \nAlthough some studies have considered the relations between visitors\u2019 mental states, \nand cognitive and affective components of a destination, further efforts to refine methods \nto elicit these seem to be needed. Baloglu and McCleary\u2019s (1999a) empirical study \ninvestigated relations between motivations, and cognitive and affective components of \ndestination image, but they used predetermined scales and hypothetical models rather \nthan elicited hierarchical relations. In their study of historical destinations, Prentice and \nLight (1994) applied the Manning-Haas hierarchy, which is based on the perspective that \nthe benefits gained from visiting an attraction are generated from the experiences which \narise from the settings of the visit and the activities pursued while visiting. However, they \nagain did not elicit hierarchical relations between the proposed variables (benefits, \nactivities, settings and levels). Most previous work has under-emphasised the \ncontributions from visitors themselves. This includes those that have used images. Indeed, \nwhile some studies (Echtner & Ritchie, 1991; 1993; Embacher & Buttle, 1989; Gyte, \n1988; Reily, 1990; Walmsley & Jenkins, 1993; Young, 1995) have attempted to elicit \nattributes of destination image, much previous research has used predetermined image \nattributes, many of which were borrowed from earlier work without eliciting attributes for \nthemselves, or they did not show how the attributes were elicited. \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  12\nFairweather and Swaffield (2001, 2002) used Q method with photographs of \nviewpoints to elicit contents of visitors\u2019 experiences in Kaikoura (2001) and Rotorua \n(2002), New Zealand. In their study, subjects were requested to sort photographs into \npredetermined groups according to their preference, and these individual sorts were \nfactor analysed. The factors were then compared to subjects\u2019 explanations for their \nselection of the six top and the six bottom-ranked photographs. Their study showed that Q \nmethod could elicit visitors\u2019 experiences and implied relations between visitors\u2019 \nexperiences and the physical characteristics of places. Their study also illustrated the \nadvantages of photographs in encompassing a wide variety of landscape settings in \ninterpreting experiences of visitors. Despite these advantages, there still seems to be room \nto consider other methods to investigate concretely how physical settings relate to \nvisitors\u2019 mental states. \nPROPOSED METHODS \nIn this study, the combination of Repertory Grid Analysis and Laddering Analysis \nusing photos as stimuli is proposed as a useful method to extract hierarchical relations \nbetween physical\/affective features of an historical district, and visitors\u2019 mental states.  \nRepertory Grid Analysis is based on Kelly\u2019s (1955) personal construct theory. The \nnotion of the construct refers to the ideas behind the actual discrimination that the subject \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  13\nmakes between phenomena (people or objects) in the environment. Constructs are \ndefined and revealed through the pattern of choices and discrimination that people make \namong elements given to them to assess (Downs, 1976). Repertory Grid Analysis is one \nof the methods that attempt to reveal subjects\u2019 constructs by providing them with several \nsets of elements to be compared. Among a variety of methods for eliciting constructs, the \ntriad method is the most used (Bannister & Fransella, 1971). With this approach, the \nsubject under study is presented with three elements (a triad), such as the names of people \nor places, actual objects or photographs, and asked to specify some important way in \nwhich two of them are alike and thereby different from the third (Fransella & Bannister, \n1977).   \nLaddering, which literally means climbing a ladder, is based on the previously \nexplained means-end chain model (Gutman, 1982). Laddering Analysis is a method to \nidentify hierarchical relations between attributes, evaluations, objects and higher levels of \nabstract mental states, such as values, in accordance with a means-end chain model. \nLaddering Analysis has been empirically used in the fields of Marketing (Reynolds & \nGutman, 1988; Gender & Reynolds, 1995) and Architecture (Maki, n.d.; Sanui, 1995) in \norder to establish how physical attributes of a place or product are related to human \nvalues. Laddering Analysis causes subjects to think critically about the connections \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  14\nbetween the product\u2019s attributes and their personal motivations, by being repeatedly \nasked \u201cWhy is that favourable\/unfavourable\/important for you?\u201d For example, a subject \nwho states that \u201cthere are many people\u201d may answer this type of question by saying that it \nmust be very crowded. Then the researcher could ask why the fact that the place is \ncrowded is unfavourable, and the respondent could say, \u201cI cannot walk around\u201d. Then, in \nresponse to being asked why walking around is important, the subject could say, \u201cI like to \nsee many local things\u201d. Constructs elicited by Repertory Grid Analysis may be employed \nas the starting point of Laddering Analysis. However, it is likely that affective \ncomponents, objectives or values rather than physical attributes of an object are elicited \nby Repertory Grid Analysis. This is certainly the case in many past studies that have \nemployed Repertory Grid Analysis (Botterill, 1989; Botterill & Crompton, 1987, 1996; \nCoshall, 2000; Embacher & Buttle, 1989; Gyte, 1988; Walmsley & Jenkins, 1993; Young, \n1995) In such cases, it is necessary to ask \u201cladder-down\u201d type of questions, for instance, \nabout how subjects think things should be in order to meet their objectives (Sanui, 1995). \nFor example, if a subject states that \u201cthe place is deserted\u201d, a researcher could ask what \nmakes the place look deserted, and obtain responses like \u201cthere are very few people\u201d. In \nthe same manner, if a respondent says, \u201cI cannot really enjoy walking around\u201d, the subject \nmight answer the following ladder-down type of questions by saying, \u201cit is too busy\u201d or \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  15\n\u201cthere are too many cars\u201d. These two methods allow the extraction of a complex human \npsychological structure by providing subjects with rules\/frames to show subjects rather \nthan by simply asking them for opinions. By providing respondents with frameworks and \nalmost the same controlled environments, these two methods help to minimise biases \ncaused by researchers\u2019 subjectivity, their lack of experience or uncontrollable factors.  \nIn past tourism studies, Repertory Grid Analysis has been employed by several \nauthors (Botterill, 1989; Botterill & Crompton, 1987, 1996; Coshall, 2000; Embacher & \nButtle, 1989; Gyte, 1988; Pearce, 1982; Pike, 2003; Walmsley & Jenkins, 1993; Young, \n1995). Details are given in Table 1. It is worth noting that most of these studies employed \nnames of places as the stimuli and they involved only a small number of respondents \nranging from 10 to 50. Few tourism-related studies (Botterill, 1989; Botterill & Crompton, \n1987; 1996), which focused on personal travel experience of one or two persons, have \nemployed Repertory Grid Analysis with usage of photographs. It is argued here that in \ninvestigating the relationship between the features of an historical district and visitors\u2019 \nmental states, some signs of visual features, such as photographs, can usefully be \npresented to subjects in the process of Repertory Grid Analysis. The use of photographs \nfor this study allowed respondents to evaluate still-image visual stimuli contributing to \nthe reliability in their responses. A study by Klenosky, Gengler and Mulvey (1993), \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  16\nwhich investigated downhill skiers\u2019 evaluation of ski resorts, is among the few tourism \nstudies that have employed Laddering Analysis. \nTABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \nIn this study, these two methods with employment of photographs are applied in a \ntentative research programme designed to explore their potential in investigating the \nstructure of visitors\u2019 evaluation of an historical district.  \nIMPLEMENTATION, ANALYSES AND RESULTS \nThe Historical District \nAreas inside and around the walled historical district in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, \nGermany, were selected for the fieldwork for two reasons: its preserved historical \nenvironments, and its touristic and commercial characteristics.  \nThis district was established as a castle town in the Early Middle Ages and obtained \nits status as a Free City of the Holy Roman Empire in the thirteen century (Ashworth & \nTunbridge, 2000). Many remaining historical features of this district date back to these \nperiods of growth. It started declining during the Thirty Years War (1618-48), followed \nby the loss of its free status in the nineteenth century due to its incorporation into Bavaria \n(Ashworth & Tunbridge, 2000). Such a period of decline contributed to the protection of \nits historical features, which are described as \u201ccrisscrossed by cobbled lanes lined by \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  17\npicturesque old houses and enclosed by towered walls\u201d (Schulte-Peevers, Bender, Cullen, \nHaywood & Oliver, 2002, p. 454). These historical features were preserved because there \nwere few pressures for development or change until they were damaged during the \nSecond World War. The post-1945 reconstruction was managed in accordance with its \nhistorical character under municipal control. Rothenburg has now expanded beyond the \nwalls leaving the historical district constricted by the addition of contemporary functions \nand activities other than those concerned with serving visitors (Ashworth & Tunbridge, \n2000).  \nThe remaining historical features of Rothenburg have been served as strong pulling \nforces to attract not only domestic but also overseas visitors. According to recent statistics, \nthe number of visitors who stayed in Rothenburg was 435,129 in 2001. In 2000, overseas \nvisitors accounted for 55% of overnights with Japan making up 42% and USA 33% of \nthese (Rothenburg ob der Tauber Press, n.d.). The well-known English-language Lonely \nPlanet guide to Germany (Schulte-Peevers et al, 2002) calls Rothenburg \u201cthe main tourist \ndestination along the northern Romantic Road\u201d (p. 454). The Romantic Road, according \nto the same guide book, \u201clinks some picturesque Bavarian towns and cities \u2026\u201d (p. 446), \nis \u201cby far the most popular of Germany\u2019s holiday routes designated to get tourists away \nfrom the big cities and out into the countryside\u201d (p. 446), and is visited by two million \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  18\npeople every year. The touristic characteristics of Rothenburg and the Romantic Road are \nalso provided in the Lonely Planet guide to Germany. It describes the Romantic Road as a \nplace with \u201clots of signs in English and Japanese, tourist coaches and kitsch galore\u201d \n(Schulte-Peevers et al, 2002, p. 446) and also comments that Rothenburg \u201cgets painfully \ncrowded in summer and during Christmas market\u201d (p. 454).  \nHence, the walled historical district in Rothenburg ob der Tauber comprises a \nrepresentative historical district that offers preserved historical features as its main \nattraction, but it has also contrived elements including commercial tourism services for \nvisitors. The district thus offers a suitable area to be investigated for the purposes of this \nstudy, which seeks to shed light, not only on historical and authentic elements, but also on \ncontrived, touristic and commercial elements. \nPersonal Interviews \nTwo sets of personal interviews were conducted in a laboratory with usage of \nphotographs. While the findings of laboratory experiments are often hard to generalise \ndue to the exclusion of variables that might be observed in the field, such experiments \nafford focused investigation of structural relations between variables under controlled \nconditions. This approach was also expected to minimise uncontrollable variables by \nproviding subjects with highly similar environments and identical stimuli.  \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  19\nAs already observed, the sample sizes for the past Repertory Grid Analysis in this \nfield have typically been small. This is supported by Young (1995, p277) who suggested \nthat, \u201cfor the purpose of construct elicitation, valid results may be obtained with relatively \nsmall sample sizes\u201d. Most of the other studies referred to here do not mention how they \ndetermined their sample size. Indeed, the question of how many subjects are necessary for \nviable results is very hard to answer from past studies. In the field of marketing in general, \non the basis of experiential knowledge from past studies, Maruoka (1998) suggested 8-16 \nsubjects per segment for Laddering Analysis in consideration of a commonality of \nresponses in group studies. However, he also admitted that there had been no rational \ncriteria to determine the appropriate number of subjects and further suggested the need \nfor studies with large numbers in order to establish how many in fact are needed. \nA small sample size was justified as practical by Pike (2003). Although no guidance \nwas available as to who and how to sample for the combination of Repertory Grid \nAnalysis and Laddering Analysis in tourism studies, it was assumed that a large sample \nfor this study was probably unrealistic. This is especially so given that the time needed \nper respondent for Laddering Analysis (60-90 minutes in the case of Maki, (n.d)) is added \nto the time for Repertory Grid Analysis (around 40 minutes in Walmsley & Jenkins\u2019 \n(1993) and Young\u2019s (1995) cases, and 40-60 minutes in Maki\u2019s (n.d.) case). Against this \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  20\nbackground, the study was carried out with 20 Japanese students (10 females and 10 \nmales) studying tourism at the university where two of the authors are employed. \nObviously, this sample does not cover a broad range of profiles. However the important \nissue for this study is not to generalise to the broad population but to focus on the relations \nbetween the components. These can then be tested in later studies with a broader \npopulation, possibly using questionnaire surveys. \nAt any rate, it should be noted that the results obtained by this study should be \nconsidered as the grounds for proposal of a theoretical framework for further field \ninvestigations rather than for conclusions that can be generalized for a broad population.  \nInterview 1: Classification of Photographs \nThe purposes of the first set of interviews was to classify photographs of the \nhistorical district and to extract terms to describe each category. None of the respondents \nhad ever been to Rothenburg ob der Tauber, but one female subject had been to Germany. \nA total of 119 photographs taken in and around the walled historical district were used as \nstimuli. These were taken by one of the authors from 12:00-15:00 on 23 August 2003, \nwhen the weather was fine and following Fairweather and Swaffield (2002), \u201cno attempt \nwas made to \u2018ramdomise\u2019 or to \u2018standardise\u2019 viewpoints\u201d (p. 288). The classification of \nthe photographs was elicited as the result of this experiment rather than determined by the \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  21\nauthors in advance. Although the objectivity of the selection of the viewpoints cannot be \nguaranteed here in a strict sense, the considerable number of photographs used in this \nexperiment were expected to minimize the subjectivity attributed to the authors.  \nEach subject was presented with 119 photographs and asked to classify them into \nfirst rough and gradually more detailed groups according to perceived similarities and \ndifferences. The decision on the number of final groups and the criteria for classification \nwas left to each subject. Both the classification and the terms used to describe each group \nwere recorded. Similar procedures were also employed in Maki (n.d.). The duration of the \ninterviews ranged from 1 hour to 1 hour and 30 minutes. This set of interviews lasted \nfrom 16 September to 7 November 2003.  \nFor each subject, a matrix was created showing the frequency of every possible pair \nof photographs, which could be generated, that is, 20 matrixes one for each subject. Then, \na single matrix was created showing the frequencies of 119 \u00d7 119 pairs of photographs \ncategorised into the same group and summed across the 20 subjects. Thereafter, the \nsummed 119 \u00d7 119 frequencies were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis (Ward \nMethod), which resulted in 18 clusters (groups). The next step was to describe each \ncluster using the terms that the subjects themselves had used to describe each group of \nphotographs. In order to establish this, the number of subjects who used each term for \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  22\neach photograph was counted, and the mean number was then calculated by cluster. The \ndendrogram of the Cluster Analysis is illustrated as Figure 2, and the mean number of \nsubjects who used each term to describe each of the 18 categories is shown in Table 2. \nThis gives only those terms that have a frequency of five or higher in any cell. \nFIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE \nTABLE 2 ABOUT HERE \nThe rescaled distance cluster combine in Figure 2 shows that distance between the \nclusters increases rapidly when the number of clusters falls from two to one. Therefore, it \nis suggested that it is reasonable to determine the number of clusters as two and categorise \nthe photographs into two groups, comprising clusters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 \n(Group 1) and clusters 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 (Group 2). Table 2 also shows that the terms \nthat distinctively characterise these two groups (Group 1 and Group 2) are the \nprominence of people and stores, and the atmosphere as a place for the locals. It is \nobserved that photographs belonging to Group 2 were perceived to have people and stores \nprominent, and that those included in Group 1 are regarded as places for the locals \nwithout the prominence of people. Group 2 generally represents commercial and touristic \nsettings. On the other hand, Group 1 generally shows places for the locals. \nInterview 2: Repertory Grid and Laddering Analysis \nIn this set of interviews, the combination of Repertory Grid Analysis and Laddering \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  23\nAnalysis with usage of photographs as stimuli was employed. These interviews attempted \nto extract evaluative components (cognitive, affective components, wants, needs, values) \nand hierarchical relations between them. The subjects for these interviews were 20 \nJapanese students (10 females and 10 males), including six men and five women who also \nco-operated with the previous set of interviews. The five women included one who had \nbeen to Germany. The remaining nine subjects (five females and four males) were also \ntourism students of the same university, and none of them had ever been to Germany. The \n44 photographs that were classified as Group 2 (Cluster 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18) through the \nanalysis of Interview 1 were employed as the stimuli. \nEach subject was presented with the 44 photographs and requested to classify them \ninto five levels according to their own preference as places for sightseeing. The \nphotographs were then placed in five lines in front of the subject so that their preference \ngradually decreased top to bottom. They were then asked the following five types of \nquestions so that they could state the components that affected their preference. \n(1) \u201cWhat causes differences in your preference between the photographs in line 1 and \nline 2? \u201d Then, the same question was asked for lines 2 and 3, for 3 and 4, and for 4 \nand 5. \n(2) \u201cPlease state anything that causes differences in your preference between any lines.\u201d  \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  24\nThe procedure until (2) was also employed in Maki (n.d.). \n(3) \u201cPlease select the most preferable photograph for you. What makes the photograph \nthe most preferable?\u201d \n(4) \u201cPlease select the least preferable photograph for you. What makes the photograph \nthe least preferable?\u201d \n(5) \u201cPlease state anything that causes differences in your preference among photographs \nin any single line.\u201d \nOnce a subject stated one component, \u201cladder-up\u201d or \u201cladder-down\u201d type questions were \nasked in order to extract relations between components. The components and the relations \nwere recorded in the shape of a tree figure by each subject. Both positive and negative, \nand direct and indirect relations were recorded. Similar criteria were also utilised by \nReynolds and Gutman (1988). For example, if the following relations as illustrated as \nFigure 3 were extracted, this means, \u201cif there are cars (C26), a subject perceives \ndangerous atmosphere (AS5) and does not feel like walking (W7). As a consequence, the \nsubject thinks that it would not be possible to adapt herself\/himself to the area (N5)\u201d. In \nthis example, the relations would be counted as in Table 3. \nFIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE \nTABLE 3 ABOUT HERE \nThe duration of each interview was from 40 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes. This \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  25\nset of interviews was conducted between 12 November 2003 to 6 January 2004.  \nThere are two reasons why the triad methods (Bannister & Fransella, 1971) were \nnot employed. First, it was found that it was generally easy for subjects to recognise \ncomponents that not only differentiate photographs, but also relate to their preference. \nFor example, two photographs may be different from each other in some respects, but it \ndoes not mean that those respects are always related to subjects\u2019 preference. They are \nsometimes just different. In such cases, subjects experience difficulty in stating further \ncomponents. Secondly, as this is an exploratory study about an historical district, which is \na very complex and broad object compared to tangible products like cars, comparison \nbetween a broad range of photographs rather than between a limited number was \nexpected to elicit a large number of components and relations between those components. \nThe extracted components through Repertory Grid Analysis and Laddering \nAnalysis were classified by the authors with reference to concepts of cognitive and \naffective components, wants, needs and values as well as relations between them, as \nfollows: \n a. level of cognitive components \n b. level of affective components \n c. level of wants \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  26\n d. level of needs  \n e. level of values \nIt seems that the previously argued definition of affective components is ambiguous \nas it could include items such as pleasure, that are highly evaluative, those, such as \narousal, that are less evaluative and those, such as excitement or relaxation, that are \nsomewhere between the two. (Nasar, 1998). Furthermore, what Nasar defines as \nconnotative of a place, such as prestigious, could also be included in affective meanings. \nIn this study, affective components that seem independent of evaluation were labelled \n\u201cAffective Aspects: Physiological Perception\u201d and the others that seem related to \nsubjectivity of subjects were categorised as \u201cAffective Aspects: Subjective Perception\u201d. \nAs for subjects\u2019 mental states, if they stated the desire to do something with concrete \nobjects (such as local goods) or do very particular activities (such as shopping), these \nstatements were categorised as wants. If the activities were not very concrete (for \nexample creating good memories or relaxing), the statements were labeled as needs. \nMore abstract and broad statements such as those concerning subjects\u2019 creeds or norms \nwere categorised as values. These were not actually extracted in the interviews during \n\u201cInterview 2\u201d. \nAfterwards, the extracted components in each level were classified by the authors \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  27\ninto groups that share similar meanings. This was done by first making a large number of \ncategories and then by combining them into a smaller number. This approach was \ndescribed by Grunert & Grunert (1995) as finding the right level of abstraction to draw a \nhierarchical map. Only grouped components that were mentioned by five or more \nsubjects were used for the consecutive steps (See Table 4).  \nTABLE 4 ABOUT HERE \nThis classification process can be criticised as subjective, and the extent to which \nthe results can be claimed as elicited from subjects\u2019 may be questioned. The extreme \nstrategy to avoid subjectivity would be to use exactly the same terms as those given by the \nsubjects with no further categorization. However, this would generate an enormous \nnumber of individual components, each stated by a very small number of subjects. Such \nresults would obscure the possible relations between components that can be detected by \ngrouping.  \nAs Grunert and Grunert (1995) claimed, the important point here is finding \nappropriate categories of elicited components for study purposes. Maruoka (1998) \nsuggested that, if the goal is eliciting hierarchical relations between components, \ncategories should be reasonably abstract in order to obtain a meaningful number of \nrelations. As this study aims to elicit these relations, classification of extracted \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  28\ncomponents by the researchers seemed necessary, even though the possibility of \nsubjectivity cannot completely be excluded. \nAs explained earlier, both positive and negative, and direct and indirect relations \nwere recorded by each subject as illustrated in Table 3. After creating a matrix like Table \n3 for each subject, frequencies in all the cells were summed up across 20 subjects. In this \nprocess, frequencies of PD and PI as well as frequencies of ND and NI were summed as \npositive relations and negative relations respectively. Similar criteria were also utilised by \nKlenosky et al (1993). The results are shown in Table 5. Only frequencies of four or more \nare presented.  \nTABLE 5 ABOUT HERE \nOn the basis of the data shown in Table 5, a tree figure that shows the relations \nbetween the extracted components was created (see Figures 4 and 5). In order to avoid \nexcessively complicated figures, the relations between cognitive components and needs \nare shown separately in Figure 4 whereas Figure 5 shows the relations between cognitive \ncomponents and affective components, between cognitive components and wants, \nbetween affective components and wants, between affective components and needs and \nbetween wants and needs.  \nFIGURE 4 ABOUT HERE \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  29\nFIGURE 5 ABOUT HERE \nDISCUSSION \nAlthough the aim of this tentative research is to propose a theoretical framework \nand methods, not to draw conclusions or to generalise, the interpretation of the results of \nthese analyses should be attempted to assess their usefulness. Indeed, the results offer \ninsights into some issues raised by past studies. As a whole, the findings suggest mixed \neffects of many components, which emphasise the complex nature of evaluation of an \nhistorical district. \nIt was suggested by the results of the first set of personal interviews that two \ndifferent types of settings of an historical district, namely residential settings and \ntouristic\/commercial settings, might be identified by visitors according to the perceived \npresence of people and stores as well as atmosphere as a place for the locals or as a \ntourism destination. This accords with previous arguments that the contrived elements of \nan historical district could mainly be observed as commercialisation and the presence of \nother people.  \nIt was found that the presence of others in photographs has mixed effects on \nsubjects\u2019 evaluation depending on how others are presented. For example, places where \npeople are perceived to gather (C23) could cause the atmosphere to be seen as being \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  30\nfamous\/worth visiting (AS13), which in turn would make it possible to satisfy their needs \nto see something famous (N1). On the other hand, when people are not prominent (C20), \nit could lead to the impression of a dull (AS7) or ordinary (AS15) atmosphere. These \nresults imply that an historical district could have an aspect as an object of \u201ccollective \ngaze\u201d (Urry, 1990). Another comparison can be made between the situation when people \nin photographs were perceived as locals and when they are perceived as visitors. The \npresence of locals (C25) could be perceived as indicating to a sense of activity (AS8) or \npossible achievement of \u201cadaptation of self\u201d to the local area (N5), seeing the locals and \ntheir life-style (W10) and seeing something outside daily-life (N3). This implication also \nsupports the notion of \u201ccollective romantic gaze\u201d, which is \u201cone that searches for \nauthenticity through local participation\u201d (Ooi, 2002, p. 85). In contrast, the presence of \nvisitors (C24) is also related to a rather negative sense of \u201cnoisy\u201d (AS9). It is implied by \nthese findings that whether people are perceived to be locals or visitors could influence \nthe perceived quality of an historical district as an object of \u201cromantic gaze\u201d (Urry, 1990).  \nIt seems then that, when the presence of people is perceived positively, such \nperception is related to a positive perception of activity, such as liveliness, which \nreinforces Hull\u2019s (1990) claim that the concept of recreation crowding could create high \nlevels of arousal. On the other hand, negative perception of people may be relevant to a \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  31\nnegative perception of activity, such as noise. Together with the finding that the absence \nof people (C20) could also be perceived negatively because of the lack of activity, as \nrepresented by dullness (AS7), it is implied that a sense of activity related to the presence \nof others could also have mixed effects on subjects\u2019 evaluation. This implication accords \nwith some of the arguments in the field of psychology that crowding can be perceived \npositively when exhilaration (Arygle, Furnham & Graham, 1981) or excitement (Ditton, \nFedler & Graefe, 1983) or social affiliation (Ditton, Fedler & Graefe, 1983; Graham & \nBurge, 1984) is desired. In any sense, contrary to some views that the presence of others \nhas negative effects on visitors\u2019 experience in the light of the concept of Crowding \n(Schreyer & Roggenbuck, 1978; West 1982; Womble & Studebaker, 1981) or Romantic \nGaze (Urry, 1990), it is implied that the presence of people in an historical district can \nalso be perceived positively.  \nBack alleys (C13), and related components, which are narrow pavements (C15), \nnarrow space between houses (C16) and shadowed space (C18), also suggest the complex \nnature of negative and positive perception of activity and its influence on evaluations. As \nfor positively perceived relations, C13 seem to satisfy needs of seeking something outside \ndaily life (N3) and adapting oneself to the area (N5) whereas C15 was relevant to the local \natmosphere (AS3), which is perceived to realise desires for local authenticity (N2) and \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  32\nsomething outside daily life (N3). C18 concerned the quiet\/calm atmosphere (AS6), \nwhich contributed to relaxation (N8). However, C13, C16 and C18 were also perceived to \nresult in a dull atmosphere (AS7).  \nThe presence of stores also seems to have complex effects on subjects\u2019 evaluation. \nAlthough commercialisation has often been discussed negatively in tourism studies \n(Hewison, 1987; Mathieson & Wall, 1982) as a spoiler of the authenticity of a destination, \nthe results of this research suggest that stores (C5: Stores, C6: Open cafe) can lead to the \nfulfillment of seeking the local authenticity (N2), seeking something outside daily-life \n(N3), adapting oneself to the area (N5), and seeing the locals and their life-style (W10) \ntogether with a sense of locality (AS3) and uniqueness (AS14). What Ohno (1997) terms \nthe \u201cmarket type of stores\u201d, which are relatively open to the outside, have more \ndecorations on the facades, and exhibit a number of goods along the eaves, are also \nobserved in the results (C11), and such types of stores are also perceived to fulfill a desire \nfor local authenticity (N2) and something outside daily-life (N3) together with a sense of \nlocality (AS3). Shopping (W1) at stores (C5) is also perceived to offer an opportunity to \nobtain a reminder of an enjoyable occasion (N7) and to obtain something to appeal to \nothers (N6). However, it should also be noted that souvenir shops (C10) are perceived to \nbe relevant to a touristic atmosphere (AS1) and a desire to obtain something to appeal to \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  33\nothers (N6). In this sense, types of stores as well as the type of needs or wants that stores \nfulfill seem to need attention in considering their effects on the evaluation. Some stores \ncould also offer an opportunity to appreciate the authenticity while others could satisfy a \nneed to obtain something of which to boast. As for a sense of activity, stores may have \nmixed effects because stores (C5) and open cafes (C6) also bring about active atmosphere \n(AS8) while stores in particular (C5) are also related to a sense of dullness (AS7). \nAlthough an explanation of this issue is not clearly implied in the results, it is assumed \nthat the types of store may have an effect.  \nIt is suggested that there are two types of ways to appreciate \u201csomething \noutside-daily life\u201d (N3): seeing notable\/large\/historical buildings (C1) or seeing the locals \n(W10, C25) and open cafes (C6). Therefore, it is argued that both very notable symbolic \nobjects and very local objects could be seen as not being associated with \nnormal-daily-life.  \nA concept of authenticity (N2) relates to locally (AS3) perceived objects like cars \n(C26), private houses for the locals (C12) and narrow pavements (C15) as well as stores \n(C5) and open cafes (C6). In this sense, it can be assumed that there are two types of \nauthenticity: authenticity in the local residential area, and commercial authenticity. In \nother words, it may be possible to feel a sense of authenticity both in residential areas and \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  34\nin commercial areas. \nThe effects of cars (C26) on evaluations are also complex. While C26 was \nperceived negatively as obstacles for a walk around (W7), spoilers of historical \natmosphere (AS10, AS16), dangerous (AS5), obstacles to seeing something outside daily \nlife (N3) and obstacles in adapting oneself to the area (N5), it also related to the local \natmosphere (AS3), which is perceived to realise desires for local authenticity (N2).  \nAs a whole, it seems that the combination of Repertory Grid Analysis and \nLaddering Analysis employed in this study was reasonably successful in eliciting the \ncomplex and mixed nature of evaluative structure of subjects concerning their mental \nstates and features of an historical district, some of which have been claimed by past \nauthors.  \nCONCLUSIONS \nIt is crucial for tourism studies to investigate empirically relations between visitors\u2019 \nmental states, and cognitive and affective features of an historical district in order to \nunderstand the complex nature of visitors\u2019 evaluation. As the structure of visitors\u2019 \nevaluation could be complex and mixed, it should be investigated with employment of \nwell-structured methods rather than by abstract open questions. The main aim of this \nstudy was not to propose clear-cut results that show relations between particular variables. \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  35\nInstead, it aimed to propose a theoretical framework and methods to investigate visitors\u2019 \nmental evaluation, especially relations between visitors\u2019 mental states and features of an \nhistorical district. Elicitation of the components and relations between these components \nthrough Repertory Grid Analysis and Laddering Analysis attempted to extract a fragment \nof the complex structure of visitors\u2019 evaluation in order to demonstrate such a structure \nand provide readers with an opportunity to recognize it. It is believed that such \nrecognition is crucial, not only for academics, but also for those who are actually involved \nin tourism management. \nAlthough this study did not try to draw conclusions that can be generalized, some of \nthe results shed light on issues argued by previous studies, such as commercialization, the \npresence of others and authenticity. For example, it was implied that historical districts as \ntourism destinations can be characterized largely by commercialisation and presence of \nothers. The presence of people may be perceived either positively or negatively according \nto whether visitors wish to see something famous. The presence of stores may have mixed \neffects on evaluations according to types of stores, such as souvenir shops or stores that \nplace some of their goods outside, or visitors\u2019 mental states, such as obtaining a reminder \nof an enjoyable occasion or something to appeal to others, and seeking authenticity. Cars \nmay be perceived as dangerous or to be obstacles. On the other hand, cars as well as \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  36\nprivate houses, narrow pavements and stores, may imply authenticity. A sense of activity \ncould arise from the locals while a sense of dullness may be attributed to absence of \npeople. These findings may support and complement past arguments about crowding or \n\u201cromantic and collective gazes\u201d (Urry, 1990). It is also implied that both very notable \nobjects and very local objects might be attractions that provide visitors with opportunities \nto appreciate something outside daily life.  \nTo sum up, it is indicated by this study that the combination of Repertory Grid \nAnalysis and Laddering Analysis could be useful to investigate such structures. The \nresults obtained through these methods may contribute to better understanding of how \nmanipulations to an historical district for tourism should be managed to meet visitors\u2019 \nmental states.  \nLIMITATIONS \nThere are drawbacks in Repertory Grid Analysis and Laddering Analysis. This \nstudy employed personal interviews involving a small number of interviewees, the results \nof which are limited in the degree to which they can be generalised. For example, \npossibilities for investigating influences caused by diversity among subjects as to their \nsocio-demographic variables, psychological characteristics or their travel behaviour, are \ninevitably prevented. These methods are argued to be reasonable and acceptable in the \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  37\nearly stages of exploring a new area of study such as that investigated here, when \nfundamental data must be obtained in order to develop theoretical frameworks. However, \nfor broader conclusions these methods should be followed by subsequent structured \nresearch, such as a questionnaire survey to actual visitors.  \nThe role of culture is an issue that was not fully investigated. To take the case of \narchitecture, for instance, as a result of earthquakes, flammable building materials and \nwar damage, many Japanese historic buildings have been rebuilt. Hence, the Japanese \nmay be receptive to replica constructions (Ashworth & Tunbridge, 2002). On the other \nhand European visitors, many of whose historic buildings are made of stone may employ \nmore rigid criteria to evaluate the historical values.  \nThe role of culture has also been examined in the field of environmental psychology. \nA study of high-school students from Asian, British and southern European backgrounds \nshowed that the Asians tolerated high density the best and the British students the worst \n(Gillis, Richard, & Hagen, 1986). However, Homma (1990) suggested that they no longer \ncope with many kinds of dense environment and view crowding as a negative experience \ndue to the increasingly high levels of density and recent cultural or social changes. These \nfindings indicate that effects of the presence of other people could vary across \nnationalities. Japanese culture as a determinant of visitors\u2019 evaluations of an historical \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  38\ndistrict is an area of a great interest although understanding of its roles seems to need \nfurther investigation. Future studies with use of respondents from various cultural \nbackgrounds would help to clarify the roles of culture.  \nNotwithstanding these limitations, the study outlined here does provide some \nindicators both to a method and to some tentative results.  The important point now is to \ntake this work further, possibly with a wider survey. \nVisitors\u2019 Evaluation of an Historical District  39\nREFERENCES \nAdorno, T.W. (1991).
