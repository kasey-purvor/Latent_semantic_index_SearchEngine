INTRODUCTION\nONE OF THE major needs in the area of intelligent trans-portation systems (ITS) is the modeling of the traffic flow\nprocess in large-scale motorway networks. The notoriously in-\ncreasing number of vehicles that use the provided network ca-\npacity has lead to severe problems in the form of recurrent and\nnonrecurrent congestion resulting in serious economic and envi-\nronmental problems, as well as increased public frustration and\ndiscomfort.\nTwo complementary approaches for solving problems caused\nby motorway congestion phenomena are possible without di-\nverting demand to other modes of transportation. The first one\nis to construct new motorways, i.e. address the problem by pro-\nviding additional capacity to the networks. Land availability is-\nsues, especially in and around large metropolitan areas, and en-\nvironmental considerations render this approach little attractive.\nManuscript received September 22, 2000; revised November 11, 2002.

Thus, before building new infra-\nstructure, the full exploitation of the already existing infrastruc-\nture should be ensured. Recent developments in control, com-\nmunications, and computer technology has made this task fea-\nsible and financially viable. Indeed, in many metropolitan areas\nTraffic Control Centres (TCC) operate performing a variety of\ntasks such as traffic monitoring, prediction, and control. It is\nwithin this framework that reliable traffic models become im-\nportant for any of the following tasks:\n\u2022Simulation. A traffic flow model is needed when the traffic\nprocess has to be simulated for a number of different scenarios\nand conditions. For example, when the impact of adding a\nnew link to a network, thus adding capacity, or performing\nroad works, thus reducing capacity, has to be studied, then\nsimulation of the traffic flow process, under different scenarios,\nis vital for sound and efficient decision making.\n\u2022Traffic prediction. The purpose of traffic prediction is to pro-\nvide reliable forecasts of the traffic conditions that will occur in\na network over a predetermined future time horizon. Traffic pre-\ndiction may be performed on-line so as to enable operators of a\nTCC to anticipate the impact of various events that take place in\nthe network, such as incidents or high demands at certain loca-\ntions. The successful performance of this task calls for a realistic\ntraffic flow model able to anticipate the short-term traffic con-\nditions that are likely to prevail.\n\u2022Traffic control. Traffic control operations in the context of\na TCC aim at ameliorating traffic conditions through the sys-\ntematic use of control measures applied to the traffic process,\nsuch as ramp metering, motorway-to-motorway (mtm) control,\nroute recommendation (via Variable Message Signs (VMS) or\nappropriately equipped vehicles), variable speed limitation, etc.\nA traffic model is required either for the off-line study of the\nimpact a given control strategy may have on the process, or for\nthe design of the control strategies themselves.\nDepending on the view adopted, modeling of the traffic\nprocess may be performed at the microscopic, the mesoscopic,\nor the macroscopic level. In this paper we will confine ourselves\nwithin the macroscopic approach toward traffic flow modeling.\nIn this approach, traffic flow is treated as an one-dimensional\ncompressible fluid with specific characteristics. The first\nmacroscopic modeling theory for traffic flow on a highway\nstretch was reported independently in [1] and [2], where the\nfundamental laws of kinematic wave theory were established\nand the background for future macroscopic approaches to\n1524-9050\/02$17.00 \u00a9 2002 IEEE\nKOTSIALOS et al.: TRAFFIC FLOW MODELING OF LARGE-SCALE MOTORWAY NETWORKS 283\ntraffic flow modeling in motorways was laid. A potentially\nmore accurate second-order traffic flow model was proposed in\n[3] which was extended in [4] and [5] to improve its reliability\nin merging areas, i.e. around on-ramps or at lane-drop loca-\ntions. A macroscopic modeling concept that allows traffic flow\nmodels to be embedded in a network context, with multiple\norigins, multiple destinations, and multiple routes for each\norigin-destination couple was developed in [6]. A number of\nmacroscopic simulators such as METANET [7], METACOR\n[8], NETCELL [9], STRADA [10] are based on that concept.\nAn essential issue related to motorway traffic modeling is\nmodel validation. Previous validation efforts were based on\ntraffic data from various motorway stretches ([11], [4], [5],\n[12]) and aimed at optimal estimation of the model parameters\nso as to maximize the modeling accuracy.\nThis paper employs previously developed modeling, valida-\ntion, and simulation tools to address, for the first time, the re-\nalistic macroscopic simulation of a real large-scale motorway\nnetwork. More specifically:\n\u2022 the macroscopic simulator METANET, involving a\nsecond-order traffic flow model as well as network-rele-\nvant extensions, is utilized;\n\u2022 a rigorous quantitative validation procedure is applied to\nindividual network links;\n\u2022 a heuristic qualitative validation procedure is used at a\nnetwork level;\n\u2022 the large-scale motorway network around Amsterdam,\nThe Netherlands, is considered in this investigation.\nThe main goal of the paper is to describe the application ap-\nproach and procedures and to demonstrate the accuracy and use-\nfulness of macroscopic modeling tools for large-scale motorway\nnetworks.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II de-\nscribes in some detail the modeling approach employed. Sec-\ntion III describes the model application to the Amsterdam mo-\ntorway network while Section IV presents the validation proce-\ndure followed along with the obtained results. Finally, Section V\ndiscusses the main conclusions drawn from the reported effort\nas well as future work.\nII. MODELING APPROACH\nA. Model Overview\nThe Amsterdam network was modeled using the modeling\ntool METANET, see [7]. METANET is a deterministic macro-\nscopic modeling tool for simulating traffic flow phenomena in\nmotorway networks of arbitrary topology and characteristics,\nincluding motorway stretches, bifurcations, on-ramps, and\noff-ramps. This modeling approach allows for simulation of\nall kinds of traffic conditions (free, dense, congested) and of\ncapacity-reducing events (incidents) with prescribed character-\nistics (location, intensity, duration). Furthermore METANET\nallows for taking into account control actions such as ramp\nmetering, route guidance, and mtm control.\nMETANET has two distinct modes of operation. When traffic\nassignment (i.e. the drivers\u2019 route choice behavior) aspects are\nnot considered, then it operates in the non destination-oriented\nFig. 1. Discretised motorway link.\nmode. When traffic assignment is an issue, it operates in the\ndestination-oriented mode.\nThe motorway network is represented as a directed graph\nwhereby the links of the graph represent homogeneous mo-\ntorway stretches. Each such motorway stretch has uniform char-\nacteristics, i.e., no on\/off-ramps and no major changes in ge-\nometry. The nodes of the graph are placed at locations where a\nmajor change in road geometry occurs, as well as at junctions,\non-ramps, and off-ramps.\nB. Definition of Basic Traffic Variables\nThe macroscopic description of traffic flow implies the defi-\nnition of adequate variables expressing the average behavior of\ntraffic at certain times and locations. The time and space argu-\nments are discretised. The time discretization is global, but the\nspace discretization is defined for each link separately. The dis-\ncrete time step is denoted by . A motorway link is divided\ninto segments of equal length (Fig. 1). For each segment\nof each link at each time instant , ,\nwhere is the time horizon, the following macroscopic vari-\nables are defined.\n\u2022 Traffic density: (veh\/km\/lane) is the number of\nvehicles in segment of link at time divided by the\nlength of the segment and by the number of lanes .\n\u2022 Mean speed: (km\/h) is the mean speed of the ve-\nhicles included in segment of link at time .\n\u2022 Traffic volume or flow: (veh\/h) is the number of\nvehicles leaving segment of link during the period\n[ ], divided by .\nFurthermore, for the destination-oriented mode of operation,\nthe following variables are introduced:\n\u2022 The partial density is the density of vehicles in\nsegment of link at time destined to destination\n, where is the set of destinations reachable via\nlink .\n\u2022 The composition rate , is\nthe portion of traffic volume which is destined to\ndestination .\nC. Link Model\nFive types of links are used when a motorway network is\nmodeled. First, there are the motorway links which are used for\nthe representation of homogeneous motorway stretches. Traffic\nconditions therein are described by the aforementioned basic\ntraffic variables. Second, there are the origin links which receive\n284 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, VOL. 3, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2002\ntraffic demand (volume) from outside the network and forward\nit into the main network. An origin link is characterized by its\nflow capacity and its queue. Third, there are the destination links\nwhich receive traffic flow from inside the network and push it\noutside. Traffic conditions in destination links are influenced by\nthe corresponding downstream traffic conditions. Fourth, there\nare store-and-forward links which are characterized by their\nqueue length, their flow capacity, and their constant travel time.\nFinally, there are dummy links, with zero length, which are used\nin order to decompose complex network nodes.\n1) Motorway Links: The basic equations used to calculate\nthe traffic variables for every segment of motorway link are\nthe following:\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\nwhere denotes the free-flow speed of link , de-\nnotes the critical density per lane of link (the density where\nthe maximum flow in the link occurs), and is a parameter of\nthe fundamental diagram (eqn. (4)) of link . Furthermore, ,\na time constant, , an anticipation constant, and , are constant\nparameters same for all network links. , , , , ,\nand are constant parameters which reflect particular charac-\nteristics of a given traffic system and depend upon street geom-\netry, vehicle characteristics, drivers\u2019 behavior etc. The param-\neter values are determined via a quantitative validation proce-\ndure such as the one described in Section IV-C.\nAdditionally, it is assumed that the mean speed resulting from\n(3) is limited below by the minimum speed in the network .\nEquation (1) expresses the vehicle conservation principle,\nwhile (2) is the flow equation which results directly from the\ndefinition of the traffic variables. (3) is the empirical speed\nequation which describes the dynamic evolution of the mean\nspeed of each segment as an independent variable (hence the\nmodel is of second order). Equation (4) is also an empirical\nequation known as the fundamental diagram and expresses a\nstatic relationship of the speed with the traffic density.\nAdditional terms may be included in (3) for the mod-\neling of lane drops and merging phenomena near on-ramps\n[5]. In order for the speed calculation to account for the\nspeed decrease caused by merging phenomena, the term\nis added in (3),\nwhere is a constant parameter determined by the validation\nprocess, is the merging link and is the leaving link.\nIn order to consider speed reduction due to weaving phe-\nnomena resulting from lane drops in the mainstream, the term\nis added in (3),\nwhere is the number of lanes being dropped, and is a\nconstant parameter estimated from the quantitative validation\nof the model.\nAdditionally, in the destination-oriented mode, the partial\ndensities for each reachable destination in every link are\ncalculated from conservation considerations\n(5)\nwith\n(6)\n2) Origin and Store-and-Forward Links: For origin links,\ni.e., links that receive traffic demand and subsequently forward\nit into the motorway network, a simple queue model is used.\nOrigin links are characterized by their flow capacity and their\nqueue length. The outflow of an origin link is given by\n(7)\nwhere is the demand flow at time period at origin ,\nis the length (in vehicles) of a possibly existing queue at\ntime period , is the flow capacity at the specific pe-\nriod and is the metering rate for origin link at\nperiod . If , no ramp metering is applied. If\nthen ramp metering becomes active. The flow capacity de-\npends on the density of the primary downstream leaving link\nin the following way:\nif\nelse (8)\nwhere is the (constant) flow capacity of the origin link and\nis the portion of that can enter link , where\n(9)\nwith the maximum possible density in the network\u2019s links.\nThus, eqs. (8), (9) reduce the (geometrical) flow capacity\nwhen traffic conditions on the mainstream become congested.\nThe conservation equation for an origin link yields\n(10)\nIn the destination-oriented model, the notion of partial\nqueues is introduced. Partial queues at an origin link evolve\naccording to the relationship\n(11)\nwhere is the number of vehicles in the queue of origin\nlink with destination , and\nis the portion of the demand originating in at period\nand having as its destination.\nIn order to enable the model to consider mtm control\nmeasures and also to approximately consider urban zones, the\nstore-and-forward links are used. These links are characterized\nKOTSIALOS et al.: TRAFFIC FLOW MODELING OF LARGE-SCALE MOTORWAY NETWORKS 285\nby their flow capacity, their queue length, and their constant\ntravel time. For the determination of their outflow and their\nqueue length, equations similar to (7)\u2013(11) hold.\n3) Destination and Dummy Links: Traffic conditions in des-\ntination links are influenced by the downstream traffic condi-\ntions which may be provided as boundary conditions for the\nwhole time horizon. If no measurements for boundary condi-\ntions are available, it is assumed that the downstream traffic\nconditions are uncongested. Dummy links are auxiliary links\nof zero length. They do not affect traffic dynamics and they are\nused to decompose complex network topologies or to represent\nvery short motorway connections.\nD. Node Model\nContrary to the link model, the node model does not exhibit\nany dynamic behavior. Let be the total traffic volume\nentering a motorway node at period . Then the turning rate\nis the portion of traffic volume which leaves node\nat period through link , where is the set of links\nleaving node . Let be the set of links entering node . The\nfollowing equations hold:\n(12)\n(13)\nwhere is the traffic volume that leaves node via out-\nlink . Equations (12) and (13) provide needed in (1)\nfor =1. In the destination-oriented mode, the notion of turning\nrates is generalized to the notion of splitting rates. Let\nbe the total traffic volume entering a motorway node at period\nthat is destined to destination . Then, the splitting rate\nis the portion of traffic volume which leaves node\nat period through link . In the case where route guid-\nance takes place at node with respect to destination (with\nthe use of VMS or other means), is used to describe the\nresulting splitting. In the presence of VMS, an indicating split-\nting may be defined; if the sign guides drivers toward\nvia (the main route), , else .\nThe relation between and the resulting splitting rate is\nmodeled by the following equation\n(14)\nwhere is the compliance rate to the route recommendations\n( , and is the portion of vehicles that take the\nmain route in absence of any route recommendations.\nThe following equations hold for any network node\n(15)\n(16)\n(17)\nEquations (15)\u2013(17) provide and which are\nneeded in (5) for . When a node has more than one\nleaving links, then the upstream influence of density has to be\ntaken into account in the last segment of the incoming link (see\n(3)). This is provided via\n(18)\nwhere is the virtual density downstream of the en-\ntering link to be used in eqn. (3) for , and is\nthe density of the first segment of leaving link . The quadratic\nterm is used in (18) to account for the fact that one congested\nleaving link may block the entering link even if there is free flow\nin the other leaving link.\nWhen a node has more than one entering links, then the\ndownstream influence of speed has to be taken into account ac-\ncording to (3). The mean speed value is calculated from\n(19)\nwhere is the virtual speed upstream of the leaving link m\nthat is needed in (3) for .\nE. Model Summary\nFrom the previous sections, a nonlinear dynamic model of the\nform\n(20)\ncan be obtained for the entire motorway network, where is\nthe state vector, is the control vector, and is the disturbance\nvector.\nIn the non destination-oriented mode, (20) is obtained by sub-\nstituting (2), (12), (13) into (1); (4), (18), (19) into (3); and (7),\n(8), (9) into (10). In this case, the state vector consists of the\ndensities and mean speeds of every segment of every\nlink , and the queues of every origin and store-and-forward\nlink . The control vector consists of the ramp metering rates\nof every on-ramp and store-and-forward link metered. The dis-\nturbance vector consists of the demands at every origin link\nand the turning rates at every bifurcation node .In the\ndestination-oriented mode, eq. (20) is obtained by substituting\n(2), (15)\u2013(17) into (5); (4), (18), (19) into (3); and (7)\u2013(9) into\n(11). In this case, the state vector consists of the partial densities\nof every segment and reachable destination from link\n, the mean speed of every segment of every link , and\nthe partial queues of every origin and store-and-forward\nlink . The control vector consists of the ramp metering rates\nof every on-ramp and store-and-forward link , and of the split-\nting rates for every bifurcation where route guidance with\nrespect to destination takes place. The disturbance vector con-\nsists of the demands at every origin link , the composition\nrates of the demand (OD matrix), the splitting rates\nat every bifurcation node where no route guidance is applied,\nand the drivers\u2019 compliance rates.\nThe state space formulation described is very usuful since it\nallows for the use of well known methods from the automatic\ncontrol theory to the problem of motorway network traffic con-\ntrol, see [13].\n286 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, VOL. 3, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2002\nFig. 2. Amsterdam motorway network.\nIII. MODEL APPLICATION TO THE AMSTERDAM NETWORK\nA. Description of the Amsterdam Motorway Network\nThe objective of this section is to describe the Amsterdam test\nsite consisting of the Amsterdam Orbital Motorway (A10) and\ncertain parts of the regional motorway network. An overview of\nthe Amsterdam test site is shown in Fig. 2.\nThe central feature of the site is the Amsterdam Orbital\nMotorway (the A10). The A10 simultaneously serves local,\nregional, and inter-regional traffic and acts as a hub for traffic\nentering and exiting North Holland. To the North, the A8\nmotorway feeds into it, carrying a large amount of commuting\ntraffic to Amsterdam. To the Southwest, the A4 carries most of\nthe traffic between the North of the country and attractors in the\nSouth such as Schiphol Airport, The Hague, and Rotterdam.\nSouth of the A10, the A9 forms a bypass for traffic between\nthe North-east on the one hand and the Centre of the country\nas well as the region between Amsterdam and The Hague\n(including Schiphol airport) on the other. A2 connects the A10\nto the A9 bypass and connects the A10 with the Centre of the\ncountry. Finally, to the South-east, the A1 connects to the A10,\nand serves traffic between the North and Centre of the country.\nThe A10 contains two tunnels, the Coen Tunnel at the\nNorth-west of A10 and the Zeeburg Tunnel at the North-east,\nwhich effectively divide the orbital motorway into two sections:\nthe \u201cNorth Ring\u201d and the \u201cRing West\/South\/East\u201d.\nThe network is subject to considerable recurrent congestion.\nCongestion is especially heavy on the north-western and\nsouthern parts of the A10, but less so on the north-eastern part.\nDue to the network structure and the current network load,\nroute choice is a factor of influence on this network, which\npresents a potential for dynamic traffic management.\nTABLE I\nMODELED MOTORWAYS\nFig. 3. Amsterdam network representation.\nB. Model of the Amsterdam Motorway Network\nEach motorway of the Amsterdam network was modeled in\nboth directions. Table I shows the limits of the motorways that\nwere considered. The total length of the network is 143 km (both\ndirections), and its main part is the A10 ring road which engulfs\nAmsterdam. The total number of links that was used to model\nthe motorway network is 654 (all types of links). This number\nincludes 249 motorway links, 231 store-and-forward links, and\n174 dummy links. The motorway links were divided into a total\nof 291 segments. The length of each segment ranges from 400\nto 800 m. Taking into account the total motorway length con-\nsidered and the number of segments used, the average segment\nlength is 491.4 m. Fig. 3 depicts the resulting modeled network,\nalong with the kilometer numbers at the points where the mo-\ntorways are connected.\nAt the North, the 5-km section of the A8 considered may be\nseen. The ring road A10 is the dominant (and most important)\nmotorway. Connected with A10 to the South are (from left to\nright) the A4, the A2, and the A1 motorways. The A9 further to\nthe South connects these four motorways thereby forming two\nsecondary rings.\nAdjacent to the motorways and in the center of the three rings,\nvirtual origins and destinations are placed, each representing an\nurban zone. These virtual nodes are used in order to model the\ninfluence of the corresponding urban zones on motorway traffic,\nparticularly with regard to route choices of drivers. Origins and\ndestinations in the modeled area may be connected via a purely\nmotorway or mixed path. In order to take into account the urban\nKOTSIALOS et al.: TRAFFIC FLOW MODELING OF LARGE-SCALE MOTORWAY NETWORKS 287\nconnections in a simplified way, virtual links and nodes are suit-\nably introduced. The links that are used are of store-and-forward\ntype. Each such link is attached to a virtual node and has the task\nof either receiving flow from the network and pushing it out of\nit, into the urban area, or receiving flow from the urban area and\nthen pushing it into the network. From a specific stretch and a\ngiven direction of the motorway, the on- and off-ramps are mod-\neled as store-and-forward links which start\/end from\/at a virtual\nurban origin\/destination. This is the reason for the large number\nof store-and-forward links used.\nUrban origins\/destinations are placed in the network where\nthere is a high concentration of on-ramps or off-ramps. An urban\norigin node concentrates all the demand originating from the\ncorresponding urban zone and distributes it to several adjacent\nmotorway on-ramps based on suitable dynamic traffic assign-\nment considerations. Similarly, a destination node collects the\noutflow of several adjacent motorway off-ramps that is des-\ntined to the corresponding urban zone. This approach has the\nadvantage that there is no need to model in detail the urban net-\nwork, which would result in a significantly more complicated\nsystem. Moreover the aggregation that is performed this way\nat the on-\/off-ramps results in the significant reduction of the\nrequired origin-destination matrix dimension. In Fig. 3, the vir-\ntual urban nodes are placed within the loops, i.e. in the urban\nareas. This feature of the model is not utilized in the present\napplication. It is part of future work that will be conducted for\nthe study of traffic assignment and route recommendation (via\nVMS or equipped vehicles) control measures. Nevertheless, the\nnetwork\u2019s model remains unaffected from this fact since it oper-\nates in the non destination-oriented mode for the validation and\nthe internal urban routes are not considered.\nAdditionally, store-and-forward links are used to model the\ninteraction between two or more merging motorways. In this\ncase store-and-forward links are placed as connection links\nat motorway junctions. The queuing model of store-and-for-\nward links provides a sufficient approximation for the traffic\nprocess at these points, and also facilitates the modeling of\nmotorway-to-motorway control measures.\nIV. MODEL VALIDATION\nThe model validation procedure aims at enabling the whole\nmotorway network model to represent traffic conditions with\nsufficient accuracy. The methods used to this end are quantita-\ntive and qualitative in nature, and both procedures are presented\nin this section.\nA. Model Validation Overview\nThe macroscopic model presented in Section II includes a\nnumber of parameters which have to be estimated in order to\naccurately model the traffic flow of a particular network. The\nmodel validation for this particular case was performed in two\nsuccessive phases, the quantitative and the qualitative.\n\u2022 Quantitative model validation aims essentially at estimating\nmodel parameters through a well-defined straightforward proce-\ndure, and is carried out in two stages. In the first stage a group\nof parameters that reflect particular characteristics of a given\nmotorway stretch and depend upon highway geometry, vehicle\ncharacteristics, drivers\u2019 behavior, etc., is calibrated so as to fit a\nrepresentative set of real data with the maximum possible accu-\nracy (parameter estimation). In the second stage, the developed\nmodel is applied with the estimated parameter values and the re-\nsults are compared with sets of traffic data different from those\nused in the parameter estimation stage (model verification).\n\u2022 Qualitative model validation aims to represent traffic con-\nditions not for isolated motorway stretches, as in the case of\nthe quantitative validation, but for the entire motorway network.\nThe goal is for the model to capture the network-wide dynamics\nof traffic congestion, i.e. to be able to predict the location, du-\nration, and propagation of congestion. While in the quantita-\ntive validation only isolated motorway stretches are considered,\nthe qualitative validation aims at enabling the network model\nto consider the interactions between the motorway stretches.\nThe process of qualitatively validating the model consists of\nmanually calibrating a number of parameters (i.e., turning rates,\nand store-and-forward links\u2019 capacities and travel times) via re-\npeated computer simulations. After each simulation the results\nare compared against real data from locations around the net-\nwork, particularly those where congestion appears, and a suit-\nable manual adjustment of a number of (or a single) parameters\nis performed based on the observation of whether or not con-\ngestion is predicted sufficiently accurately. Because neither a\nquantitative measure nor a rigorous optimization is used during\nthis procedure, the results are qualitative in nature (hence the\nterm qualitative validation).\nB. Available Data\nFor the model validation procedure, data from loop detec-\ntors for four consecutive days (June 3\u20136, 1996) were available.\nThese data consisted of one-minute measurements of flow and\nspeed for the whole day. They were used in order to determine\nthe disturbancies to the traffic system, and to provide the neces-\nsary boundary data. As boundary data, the traffic flow, the mean\nspeed, and the traffic density were used in the quantitative val-\nidation, while only the traffic flow was provided to the model,\nin the qualitative validation.\nC. Quantitative Model Validation\nThe quantitative validation aims at estimating model param-\neters through a well-defined straightforward optimization pro-\ncedure. The detailed results of this effort are reported in [14].\n1) Parameter Estimation Procedure: From the motorway\ntraffic flow process model described in Section II, a nonlinear\ndynamic model of the form\n(21)\ncan also be obtained for individual motorway stretches, where\nis the state vector, is the boundary-conditions vector, and\nis the parameter vector. This can be done by substituting (2),\n(12), and (13) into (1); (4), (18), (19) into (3); (7), (8), and (9)\ninto (10), for the non destination-oriented mode of operation.\nThe estimation of the unknown parameters for a motorway\ntraffic system is a nontrivial task, since system equations are\nhighly nonlinear in both the parameters and the state variables.\nThe most common approach for the identification of nonlinear\n288 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, VOL. 3, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2002\nsystems is the minimization of the discrepancy between the\nmodel calculations and the real process in the sense of a\nquadratic output error functional.\nLet be the output vector of the nonlinear system (21), with\n(22)\nThen the parameter estimation problem may be formulated as\nthe following least-squares output error problem:\nGiven the time sequences of measured data (measured\nboundary conditions), (measured process output),\n, and the initial state , find the set of parameters\nminimizing the cost functional\n(23)\nsubject to (21) with , and (22).\nThe model parameters\n(when a unique fundamental diagram is used for all\nsegments) are selected from a closed admissible region of the\nparameter space which may be defined on the basis of physical\nconsiderations. is a positive definite, diagonal matrix. When\nmeasurements are taken from locations in the motorway\nstretch, then .\nThe determination of the optimal parameter set must be per-\nformed by means of a nonlinear programming routine whereby\nfor each choice of a new parameter vector the value of the\nperformance criterion (23) is computed by a simulation run of\nthe model equations driven by the measured inputs according to\nFig. 4.\nAn approach to the solution of the formulated optimization\nproblem is via application of the Complex algorithm of Box\n[15]. The advantages of this algorithm are summarized as fol-\nlows.\n\u2022 The algorithm does not require the calculation of the\nderivatives of the cost functional like competitive gra-\ndient-based methods.\n\u2022 The algorithm has grater chances of finding the global\n(or at least a \u201cgood\u201d local) minimum than gradient-based\nmethods.\nThe algorithm starts with an initial complex (group) of points\nwhich are randomly scattered throughout the admissible re-\ngion in the parameter space. Then, at each iteration step, the\nparameter set with the worst value of the cost functional is re-\nplaced by a new parameter set which is chosen appropriately.\nThe procedure is terminated when the complex points reach a\nsufficiently small region around the optimum so that no further\nimprovement of the performance criterion can be achieved by\nfurther iterations. Even with this algorithm, however, it is not\neasy to decide whether the global optimum has actually been\nreached. For this reason it is useful to repeat the procedure with\ndifferent sets of starting points.\n2) Results and Model Verification: For the identification\nprocedure, four measurement sets (corresponding to four\nconsecutive days) were available from the A10 ringroad of\nAmsterdam. These data provided flow and speed measurements\non a minute-by-minute basis. Four motorway stretches were\nFig. 4. Functional sketch of the parameter estimation procedure.\nTABLE II\nPARAMETER SETS FOR THE A10 MOTORWAY\nselected from the ringroad and for each one of them a set of\noptimal parameters was established. The summarized outcome\nof this effort is presented in Table II. The first two rows indicate\nwhere each particular stretch starts and ends. In the ringroad,\nthe kilometers increase clockwise, with zero placed just after\nthe A8.\nFrom Table II it can be seen that the critical density is a cru-\ncial parameter of the model. For the four motorway stretches\nthe parameter set is identical save for the critical density. Based\non the sets of parameters shown in Table II, examples of the\nmodel output for a single location can be seen in Figs. 5 and 6.\nMore precisely, Fig. 5 depicts the volume trajectory determined\nby the model as compared with the flow measurements for the\nsame location in the second motorway stretch. For this partic-\nular location, Fig. 6 depicts the speed trajectory determined by\nthe model and compared with the actual speed measurements.\nBoth figures are indicative of the model\u2019s ability to represent\nKOTSIALOS et al.: TRAFFIC FLOW MODELING OF LARGE-SCALE MOTORWAY NETWORKS 289\nFig. 5. Stretch 2, measured versus predicted flow, quantitative validation.\nFig. 6. Stretch 2, measured versus predictive speed, quantitative validation.\ntraffic conditions in each of the motorway stretches based on\nthe estimated parameters.\nD. Qualitative Model Validation\nThe scope adopted in the qualitative model validation extends\nfrom individual network parts (motorway stretches in quantita-\ntive validation) toward the entire network. The goal of this phase\nis, by manually calibrating a number of parameters, to enable the\nmodel of the whole network (Section III-B) to sufficiently repre-\nsent the network-wide dynamics of traffic congestion. The man-\nually calibrated parameters include turning rates at bifurcation\njunctions, and capacities and travel times of store-and-forward\nlinks. The calibration was performed through repeated simula-\ntions via trial-and-error until the appropriate parameter values\nwere obtained. The parameter values were deemed as appro-\npriate when the model was able to reproduce with sufficient ac-\ncuracy the time and location of recurrent congestion, its duration\nand propagation. Particular attention was paid to the main junc-\ntions of motorways, e.g. A8 with A10, as quantitative validation\ndid not focus on motorway interactions at major motorway in-\ntersections. When a real congestion, that occurs at a certain lo-\nFig. 7. L26, measured versus predicted flow, qualitative validation.\ncation of a motorway, spills back into another motorway, then\nthe model should be able to reproduce this propagation.\nIn order to make the network-wide traffic flow model to\ncomply with this requirement, all the cases of recurrent conges-\ntion observed in the motorway network were recorded and for\neach one of them the location and time of its creation, as well as\nthe its duration and propagation to other motorways was noted.\nThree main cases of recurrent congestion were identified.\nSome of them were strongly related due to their geographic\nproximity, while others were independent from each other.\nOne of the major origins of congestion on the A10 ringroad is\nthe spillback of congestion created at off-ramps (either due to\nexistence of traffic lights at the end of the off-ramp or due to\nrestricted outflow capacity).\nThe most severe congestion of all appears upstream of the\nCoen Tunnel at the 30th km of the A10 ringroad in the counter-\nclockwise direction of the A10 (the -direction as opposed to the\nclockwise -direction). Congestion at the Coen Tunnel begins at\nthe 30th km and propagates backward on the A10 to the 32nd\nkm and to the A8 up to 3.3 km. This area is congested from 6:20\nA.M. until 10:00 A.M.\nThe second main congestion appears at the southern part of\nthe A10. It begins at 17.6 km at 8:00 A.M., in the -direction, and\npropagates backward until 13.6 km of A10 until 10.25 A.M. It\nmust be noted that in this highway stretch spillback phenomena\ntake place causing the congestion that appears at 8:00 A.M. at the\nspecific location. A bit later, severe congestion due to limited ca-\npacity appears at the 2.4 km of A4 in the direction of flow that\nleaves Amsterdam. This congestion propagates backward to the\nA10, it catches up with the previously mentioned congestion,\nand combined they create a severe congestion that begins from\nthe A4 and propagates up to the A10, reaches the A2 and prop-\nagates into it until the 31.5 km.\nAnother congestion that appears in the southern part of A10,\nbut this time in the -direction, begins at the 18th km at 8:00\nA.M. and propagates backward up until the 24.2 km of A10. This\ncongestion propagates to A4 in direction where the flow enters\nthe A10, and propagates in the A4 up to the 4th km.\nAfter manually calibrating the model parameters, the model\nwas able to predict the network traffic conditions (free, critical,\n290 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, VOL. 3, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2002\nFig. 8. L26, measured versus predicted speed, qualitative validation.\nFig. 9. L11, measured versus predicted flow, qualitative validation.\nand congested) for the period from 6:00 A.M. to 11 A.M. For the\nmotorway parts without any congestion there was no problem\nfor the model to reproduce the traffic conditions. Figs. 7 and 8\nshow, respectively, the flow and speed trajectories of link L26\n(28.489\u201328.911 km) of A10 -direction compared with the\nreal measurements from the same location. For the congested\nmotorway parts that do not exhibit spillback phenomena from\noff-ramps, the model is able to predict the location and duration\nof congestion with sufficient accuracy. Figs. 9 and 10 depict\nthe flow and speed trajectories, respectively, for link L11\n(22.950\u201323.721 km) of A10 -direction, compared with real\nmeasurements taken from the same location.\nFor the congested motorway parts that do exhibit conges-\ntion coupled with spillback from off-ramps, the model is not\nvery accurate in predicting traffic conditions. Figs. 11 and 12\nshow, respectively, the flow and speed trajectories of link L72\n(18.2\u201319.5 km) of A10 -direction where spillback from an\noff-ramp occurs. Notice that in reality congestion appears much\nearlier than the model anticipates because spillback limits the\navailable capacity sooner than in normal conditions. It appears\ndifficult to provide a theoretical basis for the description of the\nimpact of off-ramp spillback on the mainstream traffic. Drivers\nFig. 10. L11, measured versus predicted speed, qualitative validation.\nFig. 11. L72, measured versus predicted flow, qualitative validation.\nFig. 12. L72, measured versus predicted speed, qualitative validation.\nwishing to exit, may occupy the outmost right lane of the main-\nstream throughput. However, if the queue grows further, some\nexiting drivers may also attempt to use further mainstream lanes\nwhich may lead to a breakdown of the mainstream traffic flow.\nKOTSIALOS et al.: TRAFFIC FLOW MODELING OF LARGE-SCALE MOTORWAY NETWORKS 291\nFig. 13. Simulated traffic conditions in the network, 7:30 A.M.\nFig. 14. Simulated traffic conditions in the network, 9:00 A.M.\nThese phenomena are probably of a strong probabilistic char-\nacter and there is hardly any possibility to describe them accu-\nrately in a deterministic framework.\nFigs. 7\u201312 give an idea of the model\u2019s performance only at\nthe local level. As was mentioned before, the qualitative val-\nidation aims to enable the network model to capture the net-\nwork-wide dynamics of congestion. Figs. 13 and 14 present the\npicture of the traffic conditions for the whole network at certain\ntime instants. Free, dense, and congested conditions are present,\nand each segment is filled with the appropriate pattern to indi-\ncate them. The links\u2019 segment width is proportional to the traffic\nflow passing through them. Fig. 13 depicts the Amsterdam mo-\ntorway network at 7:30 A.M. in the morning. The model predicts\nthat congestion should appear only upstream the Coen Tunnel\nand nowhere else in the network, which is in accordance with\nthe data observations. Fig. 14 shows the model\u2019s prediction of\ntraffic conditions at 9:00 A.M. From this figure it can been seen\nthat the model reproduces the previously described recurrent\ncongestions sufficiently, thus making it a suitable tool for evalu-\nating the impact of various traffic control measures on the traffic\nflow process.\nV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nThis paper presented the modeling of the large-scale mo-\ntorway network around Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and its\nvalidation against real measurements. The macroscopic mod-\neling tool METANET was used for this purpose. In order to val-\nidate the model, a two-phase validation process was followed.\nThe first phase, called quantitative validation, employed a rig-\norous method in order to determine the model\u2019s parameters for\na selected number of motorway stretches from the network.\nFor each motorway stretch, an optimal parameter set was de-\ntermined. Based on the results obtained by the quantitative val-\nidation, the second phase, called qualitative validation, aimed\nat enabling the motorway network model to capture the net-\nwork-wide dynamics of congestion. The results obtained from\nthis approach demonstrate that METANET is able to reproduce\ntraffic congestion built in reality with considerable accuracy,\nthus making it suitable for evaluating various control strate-\ngies and performing further modeling and simulation tasks. The\noff-line evaluation of motorway control measures such as ramp\nmetering, motorway-to-motorway control, and route guidance\nwill be the subject of further work for this network.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.
