Introduction\nFor a body placed in a mean flow, subject to small amplitude unsteady perturbations,\npredicting the position of boundary layer transition depends both on the stability charac-\nteristics of the flow and the interaction of the unsteady disturbances with the boundary\nlayer, a process known as receptivity (Morkovin 1969). Restricting attention to high\nReynolds number, two-dimensional flows, the transfer of energy from the free-stream dis-\nturbance to the instability wave generally comes about through non-parallel mean flow\neffects, which may arise either close to the leading edge, or further downstream in local-\nized regions of rapid streamwise variation. Once this \u2018seeding\u2019 of instability waves has\noccurred, the boundary layer disturbance evolves with distance downstream, typically\ndecaying until the lower branch neutral stability point is reached, after which the distur-\nbance grows until amplitudes are sufficiently high that non-linear effects lead to transi-\ntion. A comprehensive review of asymptotic, numerical and experimental approaches to\nreceptivity and transition is provided by Saric et al. (2002).\nAnalysis of the growth rate of boundary layer disturbances has traditionally been\nundertaken based on Orr-Sommerfeld theory. The main problem with this approach is\nthat it neglects the weak streamwise growth of the boundary-layer. Non-parallel effects\ncan be incorporated, but not rigorously in an asymptotic sense (Gaster 1974 and Saric\n& Nayfeh 1975).\nBertolotti et al. (1992) present a method which incorporates non-parallel effects into\na set of differential equations collectively known as the Parabolized Stability Equation\n(PSE). The parabolizing procedure eliminates the most dangerous upstream propagating\neigenmode, and the resulting PSE can be solved by a marching procedure as long as a\n2 M. R. Turner and P. W. Hammerton\nlarge enough step size is chosen (Andersson et al. 1998). The numerical procedure for the\nPSE greatly reduces computational time compared to direct numerical simulation (DNS)\ncalculations. Compared with non-parallel Orr-Sommerfeld theory, the main advantage of\nthe PSE is that nonlinear effects can be included by considering the non-linear form of\nthe PSE (Bertolotti et al. 1992). In deriving the PSE, the streamwise variation of the\nmean flow is assumed to be slow compared to the rapid streamwise change within the\nboundary-layer near the receptivity region, and so becomes invalid in regions associated\nwith boundary-layer receptivity. Since the equations have been parabolized, an upstream\nboundary condition, sometimes referred to as an initial condition, is required. Previous\npapers which consider the PSE (Bertolotti et al. 1992 and Herbert 1993) use approxi-\nmations such as parallel Orr-Sommerfeld theory, or a local solution to the PSE as initial\nupstream conditions. However, such an approach does not take account of the amplitude\nof the unsteady disturbance at this point forced by the free-stream disturbances.\nReceptivity problems differ from classical stability theory in that they lead to a bound-\nary value problem rather than an eigenvalue problem, which is the result of stability the-\nory. Receptivity analysis provides the link between free-stream forcing (be it acoustic or\nvortical), and the amplitude of the boundary layer disturbance. Asymptotic analysis of\nvarious receptivity regimes is available. Goldstein (1983) considered the interaction of an\nacoustic wave with the leading edge of a flat plate, while Heinrich & Kerschen (1989) ob-\ntained corresponding results for a vortical disturbance. The analysis for acoustic waves\nwas extended to include the effect of rounded leading edges (Hammerton & Kerschen\n1996), and also the effect of mean aerodynamic loading (Hammerton & Kerschen 2005).\nReceptivity also arises further downstream in localized regions of rapid streamwise vari-\nation such as the vicinity of surface roughness (Goldstein 1985, Bodonyi et al. 1989 and\nKerschen et al. 1990), marginal separation (Goldstein et al. 1992) or changes in surface\ncurvature (Goldstein & Hultgren 1987). Asymptotic analysis of these localized receptivity\nregions is also supplemented by a numerical \u2018finite-Reynolds-number approach\u2019 (Choud-\nhari & Streett 1992 and Crouch 1992). In each case the disturbance downstream of the\nreceptivity region is obtained in the form of an eigensolution, independent of the nature\nof the free-stream forcing, together with a \u2018receptivity coefficient\u2019 multiplying the eigen-\nsolution. Hence comparison of the receptivity coefficients for a specific body geometry,\nbut for different free-stream disturbances, provides a direct comparison of the relative\nreceptivity. In addition, the receptivity coefficient is independent of Reynolds number\n(in the large Reynolds number limit) and these two properties make this definition of\nthe receptivity coefficient particularly attractive. However, numerical investigations and\nexperimental results typically focus on the amplitude of the unstable disturbance at the\nlower branch neutral stability point.\nNumerical investigations of leading-edge receptivity can be divided into two main cat-\negories. Reed (1994) summarises DNS methods, while Fuciarelli et al. (1998) discuss such\nresults for a flat plate with an elliptical leading edge. An alternative approach taken by\nCorke and co-workers is based on linearisation about the base flow, that leads to de-\ncoupling of the base and unsteady flows which can then be solved separately. Haddad\n& Corke (1998) considered parabolic bodies with axis of symmetry parallel to the mean\nflow, Erturk & Corke (2001) and Haddad et al. (2005) extended the analysis to parabolic\nbodies at an angle-of-attack to the mean flow, while Wanderley & Corke (2001) consid-\nered bodies with elliptical leading edges in order to compare with the results of Fuciarelli\net al. (1998).\nExperimental results on leading-edge receptivity are summarised by Saric & Rasmussen\n(1992), Saric et al. (1994) and Saric et al. (1995). Saric & White (1998) considered\nreceptivity on a modified super ellipse (MSE) due to free-stream sound.

Here attention is restricted to leading-edge\nreceptivity on a flat plate, though the methods can be readily extended to more general\ncases.\nThe asymptotic structure for a small amplitude unsteady disturbance interacting with\na flat plate is discussed in detail by Goldstein (1983), and the boundary layer structure is\nillustrated in figure 1. Here the mean flow has speed U\u221e and the small amplitude unsteady\ndisturbance has frequency \u03c9\u2217. Close to the leading edge, where xR = \u03c9\u2217x\u2217\/U\u221e = O(1),\nthe flow is governed by the unsteady boundary-layer equation. Receptivity analysis pre-\ndicts the form of the unsteady disturbance far downstream in this region, and through\nthe receptivity coefficient, the dependence of this amplitude on the free-stream forc-\ning. When xR = O(\u000f\u22122), where \u000f = (\u03bd\u03c9\u2217\/U2\u221e)\n1\n6 \u001c 1, the linearised unsteady bound-\nary layer equation (LUBLE) solution breaks-down but can be asymptotically matched,\nin some intermediate region, to solutions of the classical large-Reynolds-number, small\nwave-number approximation to the Orr-Sommerfeld equation. For the flat-plate case,\nasymptotic solutions in the Orr-Sommerfeld region are available, though the analysis to\nthe required order is particularly difficult (Goldstein 1982). Thus matching of the re-\nceptivity analysis to the asymptotic Orr-Sommerfeld solutions provides the disturbance\namplitude at the lower-branch neutral stability point. However, due to the difficulty in\nextending this method to more general bodies, we consider using receptivity solutions as\n4 M. R. Turner and P. W. Hammerton\ninitial conditions for numerical solutions further downstream using the PSE formulation\ndiscussed earlier.\nWe derive the PSE for the case of a semi-infinite flat plate in \u00a72, and review the key\nresults of the asymptotic analysis of Goldstein (1983) for a flat plate in \u00a73. In \u00a74 we discuss\nthe different types of initial condition for the PSE. In order to use receptivity results as\nan initial condition for PSE calculations, the existing receptivity analysis is extended to\nprovide the solution for the mode shape in the outer inviscid region. Results presented in\n\u00a75 show that a matching region does exist between the leading edge and Orr-Sommerfeld\nregions, and we discuss how this can be utilised in order to use the receptivity analysis\nas the initial condition to the PSE. This then provides the required link between free-\nstream forcing in the receptivity region and the boundary layer disturbance amplitude far\ndownstream. For small values of \u000f, this method proved robust in the sense that starting\nPSE calculations over a range of locations provided consistent results far downstream.\nFor moderately small values of \u000f, typical of experimental studies, some problems in\nmatching the different solutions close to the leading edge do arise. In \u00a76 we look at ways\nto overcome some of these difficulties, and show how we can use the PSE method to\ncalculate amplitudes of Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) waves at downstream positions. We\ncompare our results with the numerical computations of Haddad & Corke (1998), in the\nlimiting case of a parabola with zero nose radius. Finally we compare our results with the\nmethods used by Wanderley & Corke (2001) in their attempt to extrapolate numerical\nresults, close to the neutral stability point, back to the receptivity region at the leading\nedge.\n2. Formulation of the Parabolized Stability Equation\nHere we briefly summarise the derivation of the PSE for the case of two-dimensional\ndisturbances in the Blasius boundary layer. The PSE is not just restricted to two-\ndimensional problems, and the three-dimensional version can be found in Herbert (1993)\nThe Cartesian coordinate system (x\u2217, y\u2217) is used, where x\u2217 is the dimensional stream-\nwise direction and y\u2217 is normal to the plate. The Navier-Stokes equations are written in\nterms of the stream function \u03a8 to satisfy continuity identically,(\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u2212 1\nR0\n\u22072 + \u2202\u03a8\n\u2202y\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n\u2212 \u2202\u03a8\n\u2202x\n\u2202\n\u2202y\n)\n\u22072\u03a8 = 0, (2.1)\nwhere\nR0 =\nU\u221e\u03b40\n\u03bd\n, (2.2)\nand all quantities are non-dimensionalized using the velocity U\u221e and the fixed length\n\u03b40 = (\u03bdx\u22170\/U\u221e)\n1\n2 . Here \u03bd is the kinematic viscosity and x\u22170 is the dimensional distance\nfrom the leading edge at which the analysis is started. The corresponding non-dimensional\ndistance is given by x0 = R0. R0 is the Reynolds number based on \u03b40, and is assumed\nto be large, so that the flow field is inviscid and irrotational everywhere except in the\nvicinity of the flat plate\u2019s surface.\nThe stream function is split into a disturbance part \u03c8(x, y, t) and a steady base flow\n\u03a8B(x, y) = f(\u03b7)(x\/R0)\n1\n2 +O(R\u221220 ), where f is the Blasius function, and satisfies\nf \u2032\u2032\u2032 + ff \u2032\u2032 = 0, f(0) = f \u2032(0) = 0 f \u2032 \u2212\u2192 1 as \u03b7 \u2212\u2192\u221e, (2.3)\nwith \u03b7 = R\n1\n2\n0 y\/(2x)\n1\n2 .\nThe equation for \u03c8 is obtained by substituting the combined flow into (2.1) and sub-\ntracting off the equation satisfied by the mean flow (Bertolotti et al. 1992). Then a\nAsymptotic receptivity analysis and the Parabolized Stability Equation 5\nsolution for \u03c8 is sought in the form of a spatially evolving two-dimensional wave of con-\nstant frequency \u03c9, with a local streamwise wavenumber \u03b1(x), and a complex mode shape\n\u03c6(x, y), of the form\n\u03c8(x, y, t) = \u03c6(x, y) exp (i (\u03b8(x)\u2212 \u03c9t)) + complex conjugate, (2.4)\nwhere\nd\u03b8\ndx\n= \u03b1(x).\nThe disturbance amplitude is assumed to be sufficiently small, |\u03c8| \u001c 1, so that the\nnon-linear terms in \u03c8 can be neglected. Non-linear terms are neglected, not just for\nsimplicity, but also because we are only interested in running calculations up to, and\nslightly beyond the lower branch neutral stability point. The non-linear effects usually\nonly become significant as the wave amplitude grows, which happens downstream of this\npoint. Bertolotti et al. (1992) also discussed a non-linear version of the PSE, which can\nbe used to incorporate non-linear effects, which would help to take calculations up to\nupper branch.\nThe key assumption in the PSE formulation is that the variation of \u03b1 and \u03c6 is suf-\nficiently small so that \u22022\u03b1\/\u2202x2 and \u22022\u03c6\/\u2202x2 and products of first derivatives \u2202\u03b1\/\u2202x,\n\u2202\u03c6\/\u2202x are negligible. This assumption has been observed to hold for T-S waves both in\nexperiments and in numerical computations (Morkovin 1985). In addition, the neglection\nof these terms can be argued by noting that for a flat plate the streamwise variation of\nthe mean flow \u03a8B varies on a length scale of O(R\u221210 ), suggesting that the streamwise\nvariation of \u03c6 and \u03b1 is at most O(R\u221210 ) and that the magnitude of \u03c6xx, \u03b1xx and \u03c6x\u03b1x\ncan be at most O(R\u221220 ). Thus these terms can be neglected if we neglect all terms of\nO(R\u221220 ) in our governing equation.\nThese assumptions lead to the derivation of the linear form of the PSE, which written\nin operator form is\n(L0 + L1)\u03c6+M\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202x\n+\nd\u03b1\ndx\nN\u03c6 = 0, (2.5)\nwhere\nL0 = \u2212 1\nR0\n(D2 \u2212 \u03b12)2 +\n(\ni\u03b1\n\u2202\u03a8B\n\u2202y\n\u2212 i\u03c9\n)\n(D2 \u2212 \u03b12)\u2212 i\u03b1\u2202\n3\u03a8B\n\u2202y3\n, (2.6)\nL1 =\n\u22023\u03a8B\n\u2202x\u2202y2\nD \u2212 \u2202\u03a8B\n\u2202x\n(D2 \u2212 \u03b12)D, (2.7)\nM =\n\u2202\u03a8B\n\u2202y\n(D2 \u2212 3\u03b12) + 2\u03b1\u03c9 \u2212 \u2202\n3\u03a8B\n\u2202y3\n, (2.8)\nN = \u03c9 \u2212 3\u03b1\u2202\u03a8B\n\u2202y\n, (2.9)\nand D \u2261 d\/dy.\nEquation (2.5) is very similar to the one derived by Bertolotti et al. (1992), except we\nhave neglected the O(R\u221210 ) terms from operators M and N , as these only contribute to\nthe solution at O(R\u221220 ), so in our opinion the approximation is more consistent, in the\nsense that we have neglected all the O(R\u221220 ) terms rather than neglecting most of them\nbut retaining two terms, as in Bertolotti et al. (1992). This approach has been adopted\nby Andersson et al. (1998), and our findings have shown that these O(R\u221220 ) terms have\nno significant effect on the solution to the problem.\nA second equation is required to resolve the ambiguity of the partition (2.4) into two\nfunctions of x. A normalization condition is imposed on \u03c6 which restricts rapid variation\n6 M. R. Turner and P. W. Hammerton\nin the x direction. To achieve this, the normalization condition is defined as\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u03c6x\u03c6\n\u2020dy = 0, (2.10)\nwhere \u2020 denotes the complex conjugate. This condition minimises the streamwise change\n\u2202\u03c6\/\u2202x in a weighted sense across the y domain, and hence puts the majority of the\nstreamwise variation with x into the wavenumber \u03b1. There are many other possible\nnormalization conditions, all of which would lead to the same total growth rate used in\n\u00a75, however we chose (2.10) as this was the choice used by other authors (Herbert 1993\nand Andersson et al. 1998), and was relatively easy to implement numerically.\nThe approach taken in the present implementation of the PSE scheme, in contrast to\nprevious work, is that \u03b7, as defined following (2.3), is used as the wall normal coordinate\nrather that y. Hence the boundary layer growth downstream is naturally accounted for\nin the numerical mesh. The semi-infinite domain \u03b7 \u2208 [0,\u221e) is mapped to the domain\n\u03b7\u00af \u2208 [\u22121, 1] by\n\u03b7\u00af =\n\u03b7 \u2212 L\n\u03b7 + L\n, (2.11)\nwhere L denotes a constant map parameter, chosen to match the width of the function\nto be expanded. In this problem, the main variation of the shape function occurs for\n\u03b7 < 20, hence choosing L = 20 is a reasonable value, and we found these results agree\nwith those of the case L = 45, so there is some amount of flexibility in this value.\nThe numerical procedure consists of expanding the shape function, \u03c6, as a sum of\nChebyshev polynomials. The system is then solved at each streamwise position for the\ncoefficients multiplying each polynomial, with iterations on \u03c6 and the wavenumber, \u03b1,\nuntil the normalization condition (2.10) is satisfied. This numerical method is then equiv-\nalent to the one used by Bertolotti et al. (1992), and more details are contained in this\npaper.\nFor the purposes of this paper, we are only interested in the propagation of the eigen-\nsolutions from the leading edge region, hence we solve (2.5) with homogeneous boundary\nconditions, and as an upstream boundary condition, we stipulate\n\u03c6(x0, y) = F\u02c6 (y), \u03b1(x0) = \u03b10, (2.12)\nwhere x0 is the dimensionless starting position on the plate. These conditions are de-\ntermined by the mean boundary layer at x0 and by the interaction of the unsteady\nfree-stream disturbance with the boundary-layer upstream of x0.\n3. Asymptotic analysis for a flat plate\n3.1. Leading edge receptivity analysis\nClose to the leading edge of the flat plate, the PSE is not valid, because we have rapid\ngrowth of the boundary layer, and the assumption that \u03b1xx, \u03c6xx and \u03b1x\u03c6x are small\nis no longer valid. This region occurs when xR = O(1), where xR is equivalent to the\nstreamwise variable x used by Goldstein (1983). Hence we have a different balance of\nterms at leading order. The solution in this receptivity region is determined in the form\nof a three deck solution as shown in figure 1. The Stokes layer close to the wall is the\ndeck in which viscous terms are most important, and the solution in this deck satisfies\nthe no slip condition at the plate\u2019s surface. The outer inviscid region lies outside the\nboundary layer, and in this deck the disturbance amplitude tends to zero as \u03b7 \u2212\u2192 \u221e.\nAsymptotic receptivity analysis and the Parabolized Stability Equation 7\nBetween these two decks there is the main inviscid region, and the solution in this deck\nmust match onto the other two decks.\nThe governing equation in this region for a flat plate in a uniform flow of speed U\u221e\nplus a small amplitude harmonic perturbation of the dimensional frequency \u03c9\u2217 takes the\nform\n\u2212i\u2207\u02dc2\u03c8 + x 12\nR\n[\n\u2202(x\u22121\nR\n\u2207\u02dc2\u03c8, x 12Rf)\n\u2202(x\nR\n, \u03b7)\n+\n\u2202(x\u2212\n1\n2\nR f\n\u2032\u2032, \u03c8)\n\u2202(x\nR\n, \u03b7)\n]\n= \u2207\u02dc2\n(\n1\n2x\nR\n\u2207\u02dc2\u03c8\n)\n, (3.1)\nwhere\n\u2207\u02dc2 = \u2202\n2\n\u2202\u03b72\n+ 2\u000f6x\nR\n\u22022\n\u2202x2\nR\n+ \u000f6\n\u2202\n\u2202x\nR\n, \u000f = Re\u2212\n1\n6 = F\n1\n6 =\n(\nU2\u221e\n\u03bd\u03c9\u2217\n)\u2212 16\n, (3.2)\nwith conditions on the wall \u03c8(0) = \u03c8\u03b7(0) = 0 and \u03c8 matching to the inviscid solution for\nlarge \u03b7. In (3.1), correction terms, which remain uniformly small in all the regimes we\nconsidered, have been dropped. The value Re is defined as the Reynolds number based\non the acoustic length scale U\u221e\/\u03c9\u2217, and F = \u03c9\u2217\u03bd\/U\u221e is the dimensionless frequency,\ncommonly used in stability calculations.\nWe seek a solution of (3.1), in the limit \u000f \u2212\u2192 0 with x\nR\n= O(1), of the form \u03c8 =\n\u03c80(xR , \u03b7) +O(\u000f\n6) where \u03c80 satisfies(\n\u2212i+ f \u2032 \u2202\n\u2202x\nR\n)\n\u03c80\u03b7 \u2212 f \u2032\u2032\u03c80x\nR\n\u2212 1\n2x\nR\n(f\u03c80\u03b7)\u03b7 \u2212 12x\nR\n\u03c80\u03b7\u03b7\u03b7 = h(xR), (3.3)\nand h(x\nR\n) is determined by the unsteady forcing of the boundary layer by the free-stream\ndisturbance. This equation is known as the linearised unsteady boundary layer equation\n(LUBLE).\nFar downstream in this region, the solution for \u03c80 consists of a combination of a\nStokes solution, and a sum of eigensolutions satisfying homogeneous boundary conditions\n(Lam & Rott 1960 & 1993; Brown & Stewartson 1973). The two sets of eigensolutions\ndiffer fundamentally and their precise relationship is unclear (Hammerton 1999). The\nimportance of the Lam-Rott eigensolutions in receptivity analysis is that they exhibit\nwavelength shortening and hence provide the link between long wavelength free-stream\ndisturbances and much shorter scale instability waves in the boundary layer. The nth\nLam-Rott asymptotic eigensolution takes the form,\n\u03c8\n(n)\n0 = Cnx\n\u03c4n\nR\ng0(xR , \u03b7) exp\n(\n\u2212e\n\u2212 7pii4 (2x\nR\n)\n3\n2\n3U \u20320\u03b6\n3\n2\nn\n)\nas x\nR\n\u2212\u2192\u221e, (3.4)\nwhere Cn is an arbitrary constant, U \u20320 = f\n\u2032\u2032(0) = 0.4696, \u03c4n is expressed in terms of\nintegrals of Airy functions involving \u03b6n (Hammerton & Kerschen 1996), and \u03b6n is the\nnth root of Ai\u2032(\u03b6n) = 0 (where Ai\u2032 denotes the derivative of the Airy function). For\nthe transition problem considered here, the first eigensolution is of particular interest, in\nwhich case \u03c41 = \u22120.6921 and \u03b61 = \u22121.0188.\nNote that the wavelength of (3.4) is proportional to x\u2212\n1\n2\nR , hence when xR gets large,\n(3.3) is no longer valid as the leading order balance of (3.1) due to terms in \u2202\/\u2202xR\nbecoming large. This is found to occur when xR = O(\u000f\u22122), so we have to consider a\ndifferent balance of terms in this region.\n3.2. Asymptotic Orr-Sommerfeld analysis\nThe region where xR = O(\u000f\u22122) is known as the Orr-Sommerfeld region, and we define a\nscaled, O(1), variable in this region by x\u02dc1 = 2\u000f2xR\/U\n\u20322\n0 .\n8 M. R. Turner and P. W. Hammerton\nWe seek a solution to the governing equation in this region in the form\n\u03c80 = \u03b3(x\u02dc1, \u03b7)A(x\u02dc1) exp\n(\niU \u203220\n2\u000f3\n\u222b x\u02dc1\n0\n\u03ba dx\u02dc1\n)\n,\nwhere A(x\u02dc1) is a slowly varying function of x\u02dc1 and \u03b3 is the mode shape. We define the\ngrowth rate of the disturbance by the real part of\n1\n\u03c80\n\u2202\u03c80\n\u2202x\u02dc1\n=\n\u03b3x\u02dc1\n\u03b3\n+\nAx\u02dc1\nA\n+\niU \u203220\n2\u000f3\n\u03ba. (3.5)\nIn the Orr-Sommerfeld region the wavenumber can be expanded in the form\n\u03ba(x\u02dc1) = \u03ba0(x\u02dc1) + \u000f\u03ba1(x\u02dc1) + \u000f2\u03ba2(x\u02dc1) + \u000f3(ln \u000f)\u03ba3(x\u02dc1) +O(\u000f3), (3.6)\nwhere the terms \u03ba0, \u03ba1, \u03ba2, and \u03ba3 are given in Goldstein (1983). Here we give expressions\nonly for the first two terms. Defining\n\u03b600 = e\u2212\n5\n6 ipi\n(\nx\u02dc\n1\n2\n1\n\u03ba0\n) 2\n3\n, H(\u03b600) =\ne\n5\n2 ipi\u03b620Ai\n\u2032(\u03b600)\u222b \u03b600\n\u221e1 Ai(\u03b6)d\u03b6\n,\n\u03ba0 and \u03ba1 are determined by\nH(\u03b600) = x\u02dc\n3\n2\n1 ,\n\u03ba1\n\u03ba0\n= \u22123\n2\ne\n1\n4 ipi\u03b6\n1\n2\n00x\u02dc1\n(\n2\u2212 x\u02dc\n3\n2\n1 J1\ni\u03b6300\n)\/\nH \u2032(\u03b600).\nThe equation for \u03b600 gives a set of solutions and it can be shown that as x\u02dc1 \u2212\u2192 0, the\nsolution corresponding to the nth root matches back to the nth Lam-Rott eigensolution\n(3.4). The growth rate obtained using the first root of \u03b600 becomes positive further\ndownstream and it is for this reason that the first Lam-Rott eigensolution is of interest.\nThe numerical coefficient C1 which is determined by the receptivity analysis then gives\nthe amplitude scaling of the mode which becomes unstable and hence is termed the\nreceptivity coefficient.\nFrom (3.5) it is seen that the O(\u000f3) term in \u03ba enters the analysis at the same order\nas A(x\u02dc1) in determining the algebraic correction to the growth rate of the disturbance.\nThe analysis at this order is very complicated and was not presented in Goldstein (1983),\nthough results were obtained in an earlier paper (Goldstein 1982).\nWhen analysing the full transition problem, combining receptivity and stability processes,\ninclusion of algebraic growth terms is clearly important, especially if the parameter \u000f is\nonly moderately small. The complexity of the analysis at this order even for a flat plate,\nmakes prediction of disturbance amplitudes at lower branch difficult. For finite thickness\nbodies, with a rounded leading edge tending to a flat plate far downstream, we find that\nthe geometry enters the the problem for \u03ba via the large xR expansion for the base flow\nat O(ln(xR)\/xR), and via the term A(x\u02dc1) at O(1). Hence for moderate values of \u000f, and\nsmall xR, the accurate evaluation of the A(x\u02dc1) term becomes important. We find how-\never that at this order, such analysis is impractical. For this reason we choose to consider\nnumerical solutions in the Orr-Sommerfeld region using PSE methods.\n4. Upstream boundary conditions for the PSE\nTo march the PSE solution downstream, we need to stipulate an upstream boundary\ncondition (2.12). This next section compares three possible choices for this.\nAsymptotic receptivity analysis and the Parabolized Stability Equation 9\n4.1. Local solution to the PSE\nPossibly the easiest and most convenient upstream boundary condition to the PSE is\nto assume that at the starting point the boundary layer is parallel, hence streamwise\nderivatives of \u03c6, \u03b1 and \u03a8B are all zero, and the problem reduces to the Orr-Sommerfeld\nproblem\nL0\u03c6 =\n(\n\u2212 1\nR0\n(D2 \u2212 \u03b12)2 +\n(\ni\u03b1\n\u2202\u03a8B\n\u2202y\n\u2212 i\u03c9\n)\n(D2 \u2212 \u03b12)\u2212 i\u03b1\u2202\n3\u03a8B\n\u2202y3\n)\n\u03c6 = 0. (4.1)\nThe initial conditions come from solving this eigenvalue problem for the most unstable\neigenvalue \u03b1 and corresponding eigenfunction \u03c6 at the starting value of x.\nTo use the Orr-Sommerfeld approximation above, we have to be far enough from the\nleading edge of the body so that the growth of the boundary layer is very small. However,\nin order to consider the effect of leading edge receptivity on transition, we would like to\nstart our PSE calculations from closer to the leading edge, where there is a small, but\nsignificant, change in boundary layer thickness.\nAn improved method, taking some account of non-parallel effects, is described by\nBertolotti et al. (1992) where the solution to (2.5) is found locally about some value x0.\nWe expand the local solution as a Taylor series in powers of \u03be = x \u2212 x0 and note that\nthe second derivatives of \u03c6 and \u03b1 with respect to x can be neglected because of our\nassumption that these are at most O(R\u221220 ).\nThe Taylor series gives \u03c6(x, y) = \u03c60+ \u03be\u03c61 and \u03b1(x) = \u03b10+ \u03be\u03b11, which on introduction\ninto (2.5) and requiring that the equation be valid for varying \u03be produces two equations,\n(L0 + L1 + \u03b11N)\u03c60 +M\u03c61 = 0, (4.2)\n(L3 + i\u03b11M)\u03c60 + L0\u03c61 = 0, (4.3)\nwhere\nL3 = i\u03b10\n\u22022\u03a8B\n\u2202x\u2202y\n(D2 \u2212 \u03b120)\u2212 i\u03b10\n\u22024\u03a8B\n\u2202x\u2202y3\n,\nand in L0, L1, M and N , defined in (2.6-2.9), \u03b1 is replaced by \u03b10.\nTo solve this problem, we consider the approximation \u03b1 = constant, i.e. \u03b11 = 0,\nwhich is effectively a different normalization condition to (2.10). This approach leads to\nus solving a simple linear system problem, using methods devised by Bridges & Morris\n(1984).\nThe eigenvalue problem becomes[\nL0 + L1 M\nL3 L0\n] [\n\u03c60\n\u03c61\n]\n=\n[\n0\n0\n]\n, (4.4)\nwhich at x = x0 gives us the upstream boundary condition \u03b1 = \u03b10 and \u03c6 = \u03c60. Bertolotti\net al. (1992) shows that (4.4) produces a pair of eigenvalues which approach the eigen-\nvalue of the Orr-Sommerfeld problem as R0 \u2212\u2192 \u221e. Because of this reason it becomes\nambiguous as to which eigenvalue we take as our initial condition, which we shall address\nin the results section. Bertolotti et al. (1992) suggests other iterative methods to solve\n(4.2) and (4.3), but his analysis shows that there is no advantage in using these methods\ncompared to the one above.\nWith both the Orr-Sommerfeld and local PSE conditions, we lack information about\nthe initial amplitude of the eigensolution. This leaves the final amplitude, after the PSE\ncalculation, as a multiple of the initial amplitude, which is unknown. The reason for this,\nis that the problem in the Orr-Sommerfeld region is an eigenvalue problem, and hence\ncontains no information from the leading edge, or from the free-stream disturbance.\n10 M. R. Turner and P. W. Hammerton\n4.2. Leading edge asymptotics\nLeading edge receptivity analysis supplies us with an initial amplitude for the eigenso-\nlution, since far downstream we know the complete solution, given by (3.4), up to the\narbitrary constant Cn, which in turn can be determined by the methods described in\nGoldstein et al. (1983).\nHowever, we cannot use the form of g0 given in (3.4), because it is only valid up to\n\u03b7 = O(1), whereas the PSE requires a boundary condition defined for \u03b7 \u2208 [0,\u221e). Thus\nthe LUBLE solution in the outer inviscid region, with g0 \u2212\u2192 0 as \u03b7 \u2212\u2192 \u221e is required.\nThis outer inviscid solution is not given in Goldstein (1983) and is derived here.\nTo analyse the outer inviscid solution, we consider the following scaled variables\nx\nR\n= \u000f\u2212lX \u03b7 = \u000f\u2212m l,m > 0. (4.5)\nAs the outer inviscid solution occurs in the region \u03b7 \u2212\u2192 \u221e, we can approximate the\nBlasius function by\nf(\u03b7) \u223c \u03b7 \u2212 c\u02dc1 + exponentially small terms,\nwhere c\u02dc1 = 1.21678. In terms of the new variables, the operator \u2207\u02dc2 appearing in (3.2)\nbecomes\n\u2207\u02dc2 = \u000f2m \u2202\n2\n\u2202N2\n+ 2\u000f6+lX\n\u22022\n\u2202X2\n+ \u000f6+l\n\u2202\n\u2202X\n. (4.6)\nMotivated by the form of the solution in the main layer (3.4), we assume \u03c8 is of the\nform\n\u03c8 = P (X,N) exp\n(\n\u2212\n(\n2\n3\n2\u03bb\n3U \u20320\n)\n\u000f\u2212\n3\n2 lX\n3\n2\n)\n,\nwhere P (X,N) is a function to be found and \u03bb = e\u2212\n7pii\n4 \/\u03b6\n3\n2\nn . Substituting into (3.1) and\nusing (4.5) and (4.6), we find that\nl +m = 3,\nin order to give a non-trivial leading order balance of terms.\nTo provide a suitable initial condition for a PSE solution, the LUBLE solution is\nrequired in the overlap region, corresponding to xR = O(\u000f\u22122). Which with l = 2, and\nm = 1, in our analysis leads to\nPNN +\n9\n2\n(\n2\n3\n2\u03bb\n3U \u20320\n)2\nX2P +O(\u000f3) = 0. (4.7)\nThe solution of (4.7) which is bounded as X \u2212\u2192\u221e is\nP = (B0(X) + \u000fB1(X)) exp\n(\n\u22122\u03bbiXN\nU \u20320\n)\n+O(\u000f2),\nand matching to the main inviscid region gives\nP (x, \u03b7) = x\u03c4nR\n(\nU \u20320i\n\u03bb\n+ (2x\nR\n)\n1\n2\n)\nexp\n(\n\u2212\u000f\n3\u03bbi(2x\nR\n)\u03b7\nU \u20320\n)\n+O(\u000f2). (4.8)\nIt can also be shown that the solution is valid closer to the leading edge where xR =\nO(\u000f\u22121). However it is not valid at the leading edge, because here the motion is governed\nby the full Navier-Stokes equations.\nUsing g0 and (4.8), we can represent the mode shape in the leading edge region in the\nAsymptotic receptivity analysis and the Parabolized Stability Equation 11\nform of a composite function, for which we take\ncomposite\nsolution\n=\n(\ninner deck\nsolution\n+\nmain deck\nsolution\n\u2212 overlap\nsolution\n)\n\u00d7 outer deck\nexponential\n, (4.9)\nso\ng0(xR, \u03b7) = (xR)\n\u03c4n\n(\n(2xR)\n1\n2 f \u2032(\u03b7) + U \u20320\n\u222b \u03c3\n0\n(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3\u02dc)\u03c9(\u03c3\u02dc)d\u03c3\u02dc\u222b\u221e\n0\n\u03c9(\u03c3\u02dc)d\u03c3\u02dc\n\u2212 U \u20320(2xR)\n1\n2 \u03b7\n)\n\u00d7 exp\n(\n\u2212\u000f\n3i\u03bb(2xR)\u03b7\nU \u20320\n)\n. (4.10)\nWe now use this expression as the initial condition for the PSE calculations. The recep-\ntivity and PSE variables are related by\nxR =\nR0\nRe\nx,\nand hence if the starting point for the PSE calculation is taken to be x\u02dc1 = x\u02dc\n(0)\n1 , we have\nx0 = R0 = \u000f\u22124U \u20320\n(\nx\u02dc\n(0)\n1\n2\n) 1\n2\n, \u03c9 =\nR0\nRe\n.\nFrom (3.4) and (4.10) the initial wave number is then given by\n\u03b1(x0) = i\u03bb\u000f6R0\n(\nx\u02dc\n(0)\n1\n) 1\n2\n, (4.11)\nand the initial shape function for the PSE calculation is given by\n\u03c6(x0, \u03b7) = C1g(x(0)R , \u03b7), x\n(0)\nR\n=\n\u000f\u22122U \u203220 x\u02dc\n(0)\n1\n2\n. (4.12)\nThus to stipulate an initial condition we only require the value of \u000f and a choice of value\nfor x\u02dc(0)1 .\n5. Results\nIn this section, we present results which illustrates the matching region on a flat plate,\nand we give streamwise bounds for this region. We also demonstrate that using the results\nof receptivity analysis as the initial condition for the PSE is consistent with other initial\nconditions.\nTo make the comparison of the results easier, we split the amplitude function \u03c6(x, \u03b7),\ndefined in (2.4), in the following way,\n\u03c6(x, \u03b7) = \u03c6max(x)\u03c6\u00af(x, \u03b7), (5.1)\nwhere the maximum value of \u03c6\u00af is 1. The stream function is then given by\n\u03c8 = \u03c6\u00af(x, \u03b7) exp\n(\ni\u03b8\u02dc(x)\u2212 \u03c9t\n)\n+ complex conjugate, (5.2)\nwith\nd\u03b8\u02dc\ndx\n= G(x),\nwhere G(x) now contains all the wave amplitude information and is of the form\nG(x) =\nRe\nR0\n(\ni\u03b1+\n1\n\u03c6max\n\u2202\u03c6max\n\u2202x\n)\n.

These show the existence of a matching region, in the limit \u000f \u2212\u2192 0, where the\nsolutions from the Orr-Sommerfeld regime and the leading edge regime match onto one\nanother.\nFigures 2 and 3 show a comparison between the initial mode shapes of the three\nupstream boundary conditions at two different starting positions, x\u02dc(0)1 = 0.3 and x\u02dc\n(0)\n1 = 1\nwhen \u000f = F\n1\n6 = 0.1.

The real parts, figure 2, and imaginary parts, figure\n3, compare very well close to the wall for both starting points, but as we move away from\nthe wall, they all decay to zero at slightly different rates, and at x\u02dc(0)1 = 1 the parallel\nOrr-Sommerfeld and local PSE mode shapes vary more from the receptivity mode shape\nthan they do at x\u02dc(0)1 = 0.3. This suggests that x\u02dc\n(0)\n1 = 0.3 lies closer to the overlap region\nthan x\u02dc(0)1 = 1. Considering smaller values of x\u02dc\n(0)\n1 for this value of \u000f does not improve the\nagreement between the three mode shapes since the parallel Orr-Sommerfeld equation\nand the local PSE become invalid as x\u02dc(0)1 \u2212\u2192 0 due to non-parallel effects entering at\nleading order.

With \u000f = 0.05, we can solve the parallel\nOrr-Sommerfeld and local PSE equations closer to x\u02dc(0)1 = 0, and figures 4 and 5 compare\nthe real and imaginary parts of the mode shapes respectively at x\u02dc(0)1 = 0.1 and x\u02dc\n(0)\n1 = 0.2.\nFor this smaller value of \u000f, figure 4(a) shows that the real part of the three solutions at\nx\u02dc\n(0)\n1 = 0.1 overlap each other while figure 5(a) shows that for the imaginary part of\nthe solution at this point, the local PSE is in fact in slightly better agreement with the\nreceptivity solution than the parallel Orr-Sommerfeld solution. From these figures it is\nclear that x\u02dc(0)1 = 0.1 lies within an overlap region between the leading edge region and\nthe Orr-Sommerfeld region.\nFigure 6 shows a comparison of the real part of the growth rate, G, calculated using\n14 M.

This can be compared with re-\nsults from parallel Orr-Sommerfeld theory, (4.1), and from local PSE, (4.4), which takes\nsome account of non-parallel effects. For \u000f = 0.05 (figure 6(a)) results from asymptotic\nanalysis and local PSE are indistinguishable, while the parallel flow results start to differ\nas the leading edge is approached, which is to be expected as non-parallel effects be-\ngin to dominate. As \u000f is increased to \u000f = 0.1 (figure 6(b)), the difference between the\ndifferent solutions in the Orr-Sommerfeld region are larger. In addition, the local PSE\nsolution can only be calculated for x\u02dc1 ' 0.25 due to the first eigenvalue of (4.4) becoming\nindistinguishable from the other eigenvalues, as described earlier.\nThe existence of a matching region between the receptivity region close to the leading\nedge and the Orr-Sommerfeld region further downstream can also be seen in figure 6.\nThe dashed line marks the asymptotic growth rate of the first Lam-Rott mode given by\n(3.4). For the case \u000f = 0.05 (figure 6(a)), the receptivity results overlap the results from\nthe asymptotic Orr-Sommerfeld and local PSE in the range 0.05 < x\u02dc1 < 0.1 and so a\nmatching region clearly exists. For the larger value of \u000f (figure 6(b)), a reasonable match\nbetween the receptivity and asymptotic Orr-Sommerfeld results is seen at x\u02dc1 \u2248 0.1, but\nthere is not such a clear matching region between the receptivity results and local PSE\nresults due to the problem obtaining PSE results close enough to the leading edge.\nNow that we have established the existence of the matching region, at least for suffi-\nciently small \u000f, we can try to utilise this result by starting our PSE analysis from inside\nor close to this region using (4.11) and (4.12) as the initial conditions. Figure 7 shows\nthe real part of the growth rate, G, defined in (5.3), calculated using the PSE at different\nstarting points, with the initial condition given by the receptivity analysis. Two starting\npositions were chosen, one lying within the matching region discussed above, and one fur-\nther downstream where the LUBLE has become invalid.

When we attempted to use an initial condition further upstream of\nthese smallest values, we found that the PSE would not iterate to the correct solution.\nThe reason for this is discussed later in this section. We note that the minimum value of\nx\u02dc\n(0)\n1 at which PSE marching solutions can be initiated increases as \u000f increases. The use of\nthe initial condition further downstream highlights the fact that the PSE will iterate to\nthe correct, even if an incorrect initial condition is imposed, as long as the point chosen\nis not too far downstream.\nAs well as the restriction that PSE calculations can not be started to close to the leading\nedge, there are other limitations in using the receptivity result as the initial condition. For\nexample if we start with a receptivity boundary condition too far downstream, the PSE\ndoes not iterate to the correct solution, because the first initial jump in the eigenvalue\nis too large. However when a PSE run was started further downstream, with an initial\neigenvalue taken from a previous calculation at that point, we found that the solution did\nindeed match onto the previous runs. This appears to suggest that the numerical scheme\ninvolved in the PSE needs a good initial approximation for the eigenvalue, but is less\nrigid when it comes to the initial mode shape, however this requires further investigation.\nThe use of the receptivity initial condition was also compared with PSE results using\ninitial conditions from parallel Orr-Sommerfeld and local PSE analysis. For the case\n\u000f = 0.1, with x\u02dc(0)1 = 0.5, the initial eigenvalues, \u03b1, for the receptivity, Orr-Sommerfeld and\nlocal PSE analysis are given by 0.011416+0.011416i, 0.012746+0.005918i and 0.014008+\n0.006338i respectively, where \u03b1 has been taken to be the most unstable eigenvalue in the\nlast two cases. For this problem we chose a step size of \u2206x\u02dc1 = 0.05, and we found that the\nresult of the PSE calculations with these initial conditions gave the same solution after\nthe first 2 or 3 streamwise steps, which shows that our choice of a receptivity boundary\ncondition is consistent with those previously used. In a similar fashion, it can be shown\nthat using either of the pair of eigenvalues and corresponding mode shape from the local\nPSE analysis discussed in \u00a74.1 leads to the same result downstream after 2 or 3 steps.\nHence the ambiguity discussed in \u00a74.1 is removed, and using either of the pair of initial\neigenvalues is acceptable.\nAnother problem that arises if we try to start the PSE close to the leading edge is the\nappearance of transients due to the initial conditions. This is illustrated in figure 8 for\nthe case \u000f = 0.175 (F = 28.7 \u00d7 10\u22126), taking as the initial condition of the PSE code\n16 M. R. Turner and P. W.

With a step size of \u2206x\u02dc1 = 0.15 in the x\u02dc1 variable,\noscillations of relative magnitude 15% appear in the range 0.5 < x\u02dc1 < 2 (6.3 \u00d7 104 <\nRx < 25.0\u00d7104), but these decay further downstream. Increasing the step size eliminates\nthese oscillations. The presence of such transients has been noted by Bertolotti et al.\n(1992) and Herbert (1993), but there has been no systematic study of initial transients\nin PSE calculations. Understanding the origin of these transients is clearly important,\nthough a detailed study is beyond the scope of the present paper. However some general\nobservations can be made about the appearence of such transients. In figure 9 we see a\nmore detailed plot of the transients on the real part of G for the case \u000f = 0.15. We note\nthat for the two largest step sizes, \u2206x\u02dc1 = 0.2 and 0.1 there are no oscillations, and the\ndifference between these solutions is small. As we decrease the step size to \u2206x\u02dc1 = 0.06,\nwe see these transients beginning to appear and as we decrease the step size further, the\namplitude of these oscillations increases, while the wavelength remains approximately\nconstant, \u03bbx\u02dc1 \u2248 0.39. One possible explanation for the appearance of these transients\nis that since the initial condition taken is only a numerical approximation to the first\neigenmode, then the initial waveform is likely to contain a small contribution from higher\neigenmodes. Initially these higher modes decay more slowly than the first eigenmode and\nAsymptotic receptivity analysis and the Parabolized Stability Equation 17\nhence these contributions may become significant. This is discussed in more detail in \u00a76,\nbut for the value of \u000f used in figure 9, it can be shown using Goldstein\u2019s asymptotics\nthat the corresponding wavelength of the amplitude of the first eigenmode plus a small\ncorrection given by the second eigenmode is \u03bbx\u02dc1 \u2248 0.36. While this is not conclusive\nevidence of the origin of transients in PSE solutions, it is worthy of further investigation\nelsewhere. We believe it is a combination of these transients, which are related to the\nstreamwise step size, as well as the difficulty finding the eigenvalue which leads to the\nfailure of PSE convergence starting the calculation too close to the leading edge. The\nmagnitude of the initial transient oscillations become increasingly large for smaller \u000f or\nsmaller x\u02dc(0)1 , and in most cases become so large so quickly, that the PSE code fails to\nconverge.\nThe results presented above, have focused on the initial (upstream) conditions suitable\nfor PSE marching solutions. In particular it has been shown that conditions given by\nreceptivity analysis in the region of the leading edge can be used as initial conditions.\nCombining receptivity analysis with stability calculations using numerical solutions of the\nPSE allows the determination of disturbance amplitudes at lower branch as a function of\nfree-stream disturbance. We define the disturbance amplitude to be the absolute value of\n\u03c8 at the point where the real part of \u03c8 attains its maximum value, i.e where Re(\u03c6\u00af) = 1.\nWe must take great care when evaluating the disturbance amplitude downstream, because\nof the\nexp\n(\u222b x\nG(x)dx\n)\n,\nterm in (5.2), which when we change variables to x\u02dc1 becomes\nexp\n(\nU \u203220\n2\u000f2\n\u222b x\u02dc1\nG(x\u02dc1)dx\u02dc1\n)\n.\nAny errors in the evaluation of the integral due to the step size \u2206x\u02dc1 are magnified for\nvery small \u000f. Thus we use Bode\u2019s rule for equally spaced mesh points, which has an error\nterm of O((\u2206x\u02dc1)7).\nThere are still two questions relating to the PSE which need addressing. Specifically,\nhow is the disturbance amplitude downstream affected by changing the starting position\nof the PSE and by varying the step size? To address this, we define A\u02c6(x\u02dc(0)1 , x\u02dc1) to be\nthe disturbance amplitude at x\u02dc1, starting the PSE calculation at x\u02dc\n(0)\n1 , with the initial\ncondition given by the receptivity result (4.11) and (4.12). Using this, the existence of a\nmatching region between the receptivity results and the region over which PSE calcula-\ntions are possible corresponds to the range of values of x\u02dc(0)1 over which A\u02c6 is independent\nof x\u02dc(0)1 . Taking \u000f = 0.05 and a step size \u2206x\u02dc1 = 0.05, PSE calculations can not be started\ncloser to the leading edge than x\u02dc(0)1 = 0.05, for reasons explained earlier. Thus in figure\n10 we plot the amplitude at x\u02dc1 = 0.5 as a function of starting position, but normalized\nby the value when x\u02dc(0)1 = 0.05\nA\u02dc(x\u02dc(0)1 ) =\nA\u02c6(x\u02dc(0)1 , 0.5)\nA\u02c6(0.05, 0.5)\n.\nThe position x\u02dc1 = 0.5 is chosen as the point of comparison of the amplitudes because it\nis far enough from the turning point in Re(G), that the change in growth rate is much\nsmoother (see figure 7(a)), thus not affecting any interpolation of the final point in the\ngrowth rate, which may introduce a small error. Taking larger values of x\u02dc1 at which to\ncalculate the amplitude does not affect the results. For a PSE step-size of \u2206x\u02dc1 = 0.05,\n18 M. R. Turner and P. W.

Note Rx = U\u221ex\u2217\/\u03bd = U \u203220 x\u02dc1\/(2\u000f\n8).\nit is seen that for 0.05 < x\u02dc1 < 0.1 there is a 26 % change in amplitude. This reinforces\nthe earlier conclusion that a well defined matching region exists, at least for sufficiently\nsmall \u000f. It is also apparent that changing the step size makes only a small change in\nthe amplitude. Comparisons over a wider range of step sizes is not possible due to the\nappearence of transients as noted earlier.\nBefore we go on to compare these solutions with full scale numerics, we consider\nthe comparison between growth rates obtained from PSE results and asymptotic Orr-\nSommerfeld results downstream of the leading edge. In figure 11, we compare G for\n\u000f = 0.1 calculated via the PSE and the asymptotic Orr-Sommerfeld calculations, up to\nand beyond the lower branch neutral stability point, which for this value of \u000f occurs at\nx\u02dc1 = 3.946. We show the asymptotic Orr-Sommerfeld solution calculated up to and in-\ncluding both O(\u000f3 ln \u000f) and O(\u000f3) terms, to show the significant difference when the O(\u000f3)\nterm is added. We have very good agreement between the PSE and the O(\u000f3) asymp-\ntotics up to the neutral stability point, but beyond this point the results differ. However\nafter the neutral stability point we have much better agreement between the PSE and\nAsymptotic receptivity analysis and the Parabolized Stability Equation 19\nO(\u000f3 ln \u000f) asymptotics. Thus it appears that the O(\u000f3) term becomes non-uniform with\ndistance downstream.\nThe exact form of the O(\u000f3) correction term is not considered here, but it contains\ncomplicated integrals, the limits of which depend on \u03ba (Goldstein 1982). The equation\nfor Ax\u02dc1\/A, which enters at order \u000f\n3, contains terms proportional to \u03ba, which on inserting\nexpansion (3.6) for \u03ba(\u000f) leads to a solution in the form of an asymptotic expansion in\npowers of \u000f. To consider a true asymptotic expansion, we require just the leading order\nterm of A(x\u02dc1)\/A, and hence use \u03ba0 in place of \u03ba in the original equation. However similar\ncalculations using \u03ba up to and including O(\u000f3 ln \u000f) terms, and a full numerical value of\n\u03ba were considerably different from the results shown here, whereas the difference should\nonly have been O(\u000f). This is due to shifting the contour in the complex plane over which\nintegrals involving Airy functions are evaluated. The Airy functions oscillate rapidly, and\ndecay, when their argument is between \u2212pi\/3 and pi\/3, but away from the real axis, so\na slight shift in the contour has a significant effect on the value of the integrals. Further\nanalysis of the O(\u000f3) term is of considerable interest but will not be considered here.\nIn summary, the results presented in this section show that this PSE method can be\nused to march the Tollmien-Schlichting wave disturbance downstream from the receptiv-\nity region to the neutral stability point, where we can calculate its amplitude in order to\ncompare with other studies.\n6. Comparison with previous numerical studies\nIn this paper we have described a method for obtaining the amplitude of the unstable\ncomponent of the boundary layer disturbance at the lower branch neutral stability point\nand downstream of it in order to investigate the effect of free-stream forcing on transition.\nAttention is restricted to cases where the \u2018seeding\u2019 of unsteady disturbances in the bound-\nary layer (known as receptivity) occurs in the region close to the leading edge. The actual\nform of free-stream forcing, be it due to acoustic wave or free-stream turbulence, only\nenters the analysis through a numerical receptivity coefficient, determined by asymptotic\nanalysis of the leading edge region. For a flat plate it is possible to match asymptotic\nresults from the receptivity region to asymptotic results from Orr-Sommerfeld theory and\nthis was illustrated in \u00a74. However the complexity of the Orr-Sommerfeld asymptotics\nfor even a flat plate makes extension of these results to more general bodies impractical.\nInstead we choose to use results from the receptivity analysis as an initial condition for a\nnumerical solution using the Parabolized Stability Equation. Figure 6 illustrates that for\nsmall \u000f an overlap region between the receptivity region and the Orr-Sommerfeld region\nexists which means that using receptivity results as an initial condition for PSE codes\ncan be completely justified, though for larger values of \u000f more care is required.\nTo calculate the amplitude of the eigensolution at a given point downstream, we need to\nbe able to integrate over the growth rate from some point in the receptivity region which\nwe believe to be in the matching region, where the amplitude is known from (3.4) and\nthe numerically determined value of the receptivity coefficient. This is straightforward\nfor small values of \u000f, as we can take the PSE right back to this matching region. However\nfor larger \u000f, we have to \u2018patch\u2019 this region using a curve fitting technique, because we\nhave to start our PSE calculation downstream of the matching region. We patch the\nfunction in the range x\u02dc\u03b1 < x\u02dc1 < x\u02dc\u03b2 , where x\u02dc\u03b1 is a point in the receptivity region that\nwe believe to be in the matching region, and x\u02dc\u03b2 is the closest point to the leading edge\nthat we could get the result in the Orr-Sommerfeld region. We require that the patching\n20 M. R. Turner and P. W.

For the first one we\ndefine G1 to be\nG1(x\u02dc1) = \u03bb1(x\u02dc1)f\u02dc1(x\u02dc1) + \u03bb2(x\u02dc1)f\u02dc2(x\u02dc1),\nwhere\n\u03bb1 =\n1\n2\n(1\u2212 tanh \u03b8) and \u03bb2 = 12(1 + tanh \u03b8),\nand\n\u03b8 =\n5\n(\nx\u02dc1 \u2212 12 (x\u02dc\u03b1 + x\u02dc\u03b2)\n)\nx\u02dc\u03b2 \u2212 x\u02dc\u03b1 .\nThe function f\u02dc1 is taken to be the straight line extension of f1 from x\u02dc\u03b1 to x\u02dc\u03b2 , and f\u02dc2 is\ntaken to be the straight line extension of f2 from x\u02dc\u03b2 to x\u02dc\u03b1. For the second, we define G2\nto be\nG2(x\u02dc1) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3 f1(x\u02dc1) x\u02dc1 < x\u02dc\u03b1,Ax\u02dc31 +Bx\u02dc21 + Cx\u02dc1 +D x\u02dc\u03b1 < x\u02dc1 < x\u02dc\u03b2 ,\nf2(x\u02dc1) x\u02dc1 > x\u02dc\u03b2 ,\nwhere A, B, C and D are constants chosen so that G2 and its derivative are continuous\nat x\u02dc\u03b1 and x\u02dc\u03b2 .\nThe results of the patching on the growth rates, Re(G1) and Re(G2), can be seen for\ntwo values of \u000f in figure 12. For the case \u000f = 0.075, only a small amount of patching\nwas required around x\u02dc1 = 0.1 and both methods gave similar results, leading to an 8%\ndifference in the T-S wave amplitude at lower branch. However when \u000f = 0.2, we had\nto patch a much larger region between 0.25 < x\u02dc1 < 1.0, which leads to the growth\nrate curve of G1 possibly dropping more rapidly between 0.5 < x\u02dc1 < 1.0 than expected\nwhen we compare its shape to the \u000f = 0.075 curve. This gives a 22% difference in T-S\nAsymptotic receptivity analysis and the Parabolized Stability Equation 21\n(a)\n 1e-40\n 1e-35\n 1e-30\n 1e-25\n 1e-20\n 1e-15\n 1e-10\n 1e-05\n 1\n 0.06  0.08  0.1  0.12  0.14  0.16  0.18  0.2  0.22  0.24\u03b5\n|\u03c8|\n(b)\n 1e-40\n 1e-35\n 1e-30\n 1e-25\n 1e-20\n 1e-15\n 1e-10\n 1e-05\n 1\n 0  2e-05  4e-05  6e-05  8e-05  0.0001  0.00012  0.00014\n||\u03c8\nF\nFigure 13.

However the G2 curve\nappears to give a shape similar to the \u000f = 0.075 curve, and this curve also gives better\nagreement with Goldstein\u2019s asymptotics. It is because of this reason that we choose to\nuse this patching technique for the remainder of the paper.\nUsing our chosen method, the amplitude of the T-S wave can be calculated at all\npoints downstream. Figure 13 shows the amplitude of the T-S wave at the lower branch\nneutral stability point as a function of \u000f where the free-stream disturbance is taken to\nbe an acoustic wave propagation parallel to the mean flow. In this case, the receptivity\ncoefficient in (4.12) is given by Goldstein et al. (1983) as |C1| = 0.9662. Results for very\nsmall \u000f are asymptotically valid due to the well-defined matching region, while results for\nlarger values of \u000f involve numerical patching but do allow comparison with experimental\nand numerical results.\nHaddad & Corke (1998) consider a parabola at zero angle of incidence to a uniform\nflow with a small amplitude acoustic disturbance propagating parallel to the mean flow.\nThe steady flow around the body is solved numerically and the unsteady disturbance\nobtained by solving a linear perturbation. Downstream, the unsteady disturbance con-\nsists of a Stokes-wave determined by the local forcing at that location, together with a\nsum of Tollmien-Schlichting waves. Upstream of the first neutral stability point, the T-S\nwaves are small compared with the Stokes wave. The asymptotic form of the Stokes wave\nfar downstream can be obtained (Hammerton 1999), but instead Haddad & Corke ob-\ntain a numerical approximation to the Stokes solution by solving the unsteady equation\nwith convective-inertia terms dropped. If we form an asymptotic solution for the Stokes\nsolution used by Haddad & Corke, in powers of \u000f = Re\u2212\n1\n6 , we find\n\u03c8ST = (2\u03be)\n1\n2 \u03b7 +O(\u000f6),\nat the outer edge of the boundary layer. However Hammerton (1999) found the same\nsolution to be\n\u03c8ST = (2\u03be)\n1\n2\n(\n\u03b7 +O(\u03be\u2212\n1\n2 )\n)\n+O(\u000f6),\nwhere the O(\u03be\u2212\n1\n2 ) correction terms come from the inclusion of the convective-inertia\nterms. Having obtained an expression for the Stokes solution, this is subtracted from\nthe unsteady solution in order to provide an approximation to the magnitude of the T-S\nwaves, after a filtering process in which any waves of wavelength greater than 2\u03bbTS are\nremoved. This process should remove any remaining contribution by the Stokes solution.\nHaddad & Corke check their method against existing asymptotics on a flat plate by\n22 M. R. Turner and P. W.

The results\nof the present paper (solid line) agree well with the results of Haddad & Corke (dotted\nline) (cf figure 13(b) from Haddad & Corke (1998), after the data has been filtered),\ndownstream of the lower branch point and in particular around the upper branch of the\nneutral stability curve. The discrepancy between the two sets of results around the lower\nbranch point could be down to two factors. The value of \u000f is relatively large and hence\nwe are considering points close to the turning point of the neutral stability curve where\nall numerical methods are very sensitive (see Schmid & Henningson (2001), figure 7.30).\nIn addition, any numerical errors associated with the subtraction of the Stokes wave\nand the filtering of higher modes in Haddad & Corke are likely to be most significant\nat this point since the unstable T-S wave has its lowest amplitude there. Comparison\nwith experiments is difficult for the flat plate, however our comparisons with Haddad &\nCorke\u2019s numerics strongly suggests that our receptivity\/PSE method is valid.\nSaric & Rasmussen (1992) conducted experiments on a flat plate with an elliptical\nleading edge stuck onto it, but it was noted that the discontinuity in curvature, at the\njoin, produced another region of receptivity. Saric et al. (1995) eliminated this problem\nby using an elliptic leading edge machine drilled onto a flat plate, called a Modified Super\nEllipse (MSE), to eliminate any discontinuity, and further experiments were carried out\nby Saric & White (1998). Fuciarelli et al. (1998) and Wanderley & Corke (2001) both\ncomputed their respective numerical calculations for the MSE in order to compare their\nresults with those of Saric & White. Excellent agreement of the T-S wave amplitude at\nlower branch is found between Wanderley & Corke and the experiments, however in this\npaper we are not able to make comparisons with these results, due to the significance of\nnon-zero pressure gradients along a MSE.\nAs well as producing amplitude results at lower branch to compare with experimental\nmeasurements, the numerical methods of Corke and co-workers were used to compare\nwith leading edge receptivity results. Wanderley & Corke define a general form of the\nreceptivity coefficient as the ratio of the maximum T-S wave amplitude at an x-location\nto the amplitude of the free-stream disturbance, and denote it by Kx = |(uTS)|\/|(u\u221e)|,\nAsymptotic receptivity analysis and the Parabolized Stability Equation 23\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nRx x 10\n\u22124\n\u03c8|ln(    )|\nFigure 15.

For the\nMSE, Wanderley & Corke considered the disturbance amplitude in a region just up-\nstream of the lower branch neutral stability point believing that in this region the first\nT-S mode dominates. We are able to investigate this assumption in figure 15, which\nshows the log of the amplitudes (ln(\u03c8) =\n\u222b\nRe(G)dxR) of the first 5 eigenfunctions cal-\nculated using Goldstein\u2019s asymptotic method as a function of the streamwise Reynolds\nnumber, Rx, where the neutral stability point occurs at Rx \u2248 3.1\u00d7105. The correspond-\ning Reynolds number based on the boundary layer thickness can be calculated using\nR\u03b4 = 1.72R\n1\n2\nx , and in this variable the neutral stability point occurs at R\u03b4 = 958. In the\nregion 2 \u00d7 105 < Rx < 3 \u00d7 105 (769 < R\u03b4 < 942) considered by Wanderley & Corke\nit does not appear that the 1st T-S mode dominates the 3rd, 4th and 5th T-S modes,\nalthough it does dominate the 2nd. However Goldstein et al. (1983) showed that for a flat\nplate the receptivity coefficients multiplying the 3rd, 4th and 5th T-S modes, are at least\n5 times smaller than the coefficient multiplying 1st T-S mode. Hence if similar results\nhold for the rounded leading edge geometry considered, then the assumption that the\nfirst T-S mode dominates all other T-S modes may indeed be valid.\nWanderley & Corke then assume that this T-S mode has constant decay rate at all\nlocations back to the leading edge and an amplitude of the unsteady disturbance is found\nat the leading edge, though the physical interpretation of such a quantity is unclear. This\nextrapolation is marked as the dotted line in figure 16 (cf figure 10 of Wanderley & Corke\n(2001)) for \u000f = 0.194 (F = 54.0\u00d7 10\u22126). However this analysis does have some possible\nflaws. The most important of these is the assumption of constant decay rate between\nthe leading edge and the lower branch neutral stability point. If the extrapolation was\nperformed on results closer to the neutral stability point the measured decay rate would\nbe much less and the value ofKx extrapolated to the leading edge would be much smaller.\n24 M.

Plot of figure 10 from Wanderley & Corke (2001) for a 20:1 MSE with the results\nfrom PSE calculations for \u000f = 0.194 (F = 54.0\u00d7 10\u22126).\nResults of this analysis for a flat plate are not available, but in figure 16 the results of\nthe present paper for a flat plate are compared with the numerical results of Wanderley\n& Corke for a Modified Super Ellipse. This shows that for a flat plate the assumption of\nconstant growth rate is not valid in this case. It is possible that the points calculated by\nWanderley & Corke in figure 16 could be solely that of the 1st T-S mode, for the reasons\ndiscussed earlier. However a better comparison between leading edge receptivity analysis\nand the numerical analysis of Wanderley & Corke would be possible if T-S amplitudes\nslightly downstream of the lower branch neutral stability point were available, since then\nthere would be no question that the unstable T-S mode dominated the solution as seen\nin figure 14. Using results from PSE calculations for the particular geometry would then\nallow the extrapolation of the T-S amplitude to positions closer to the leading edge.\nThis would then allow comparison with the receptivity coefficients used in asymptotic\ninvestigations which have more physical relevance in this leading edge region than the\nKLE calculated by Wanderley & Corke.\n7. Conclusions\nTo conclude, the method presented in this paper has demonstrated that for a flat plate\nwe can accurately calculate T-S mode amplitudes at the lower branch neutral stability\npoint for sufficiently small \u000f (large Re) where a well defined matching region is apparent.\nWe also demonstrated that for larger \u000f we can patch the data from the PSE to that\nof the leading edge asymptotics and produce T-S wave calculations which agree well\nwith numerical data. Adjoint methods (Hill 1995) have recently been extended to look\nat the receptivity problem (Giannetti 2002), and this is a future area of comparison.\nThe present PSE method can be readily extended to more general geometries. Using\nthis method for the Modified Super Ellipse would allow us to investigate the importance\nof leading edge curvature on T-S wave amplitudes and allow better comparison with\nthe numerical results obtained by Wanderley & Corke as well as experimental data. In\naddition, quantitative comparison between results of asymptotic receptivity analysis for\ndifferent free-stream disturbances and existing experiments will be possible. This is work\ncurrently in progress.\nAsymptotic receptivity analysis and the Parabolized Stability Equation 25\nThe authors would like to thank the referees for their interesting and useful comments\ntowards this paper.\nREFERENCES\nAndersson, P., Henningson, D.
