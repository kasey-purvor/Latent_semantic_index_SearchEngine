The w-right topology for X, \u03c1(X), is a stronger locally convex\ntopology, which may be analogously characterized by taking re\ufb02exive Banach spaces\nin place of Hilbert spaces. For any Banach space Y , a linear map T : X \u2192 Y is known\nto be weakly compact precisely when T is continuous from the w-right topology to\nthe norm topology of Y . The main results deal with conditions for, and consequences\nof, the coincidence of these two topologies on norm bounded sets. A large class of\nBanach spaces, including all C\u2217-algebras and, more generally, all JB\u2217-triples, exhibit\nthis behaviour.\n1. Introduction, background and notation\nA celebrated theorem of Davis et al . [7] states that, for Banach spaces X and Y , a\nlinear map T : X \u2192 Y is weakly compact if and only if there is a re\ufb02exive Banach\nspace E with bounded linear maps R : X \u2192 E and S : E \u2192 Y such that T = SR. In\nother words, the operator ideal, W, of all weakly compact operators between Banach\nspaces coincides with the ideal of all operators that are factorizable through re\ufb02exive\nspaces. Operators factoring through Hilbert spaces constitute another example of\nan operator ideal (denoted by \u03932).\n1249\nc\u00a9 2010 The Royal Society of Edinburgh\n1250 A. M. Peralta, I. Villanueva, J. D. M. Wright and K. Ylinen\nThe operator ideals W and \u03932 have been shown to be very useful in de\ufb01ning\nseveral topologies on a Banach space. Following [26], for the time being, we denote\nby P(W)(X) the locally convex topology on X generated by the seminorms of the\nform x \u0002\u2192 \u2016Sx\u2016, where S is a bounded linear map from X to a re\ufb02exive Banach\nspace, and by P(\u03932)(X) the analogous topology, where S is always a bounded\nlinear map into a Hilbert space. Then a linear map T : X \u2192 Y factors through a\nre\ufb02exive space (respectively, a Hilbert space) if and only if it is continuous from\nP(W)(X) (respectively, from P(\u03932)(X)) to the norm topology (see [26] or \u00a7 2). We\nconsider these topologies (with di\ufb00erent names) below, and results concerning their\ninterconnections will be discussed.\nIf X is taken to be a commutative unital C\u2217-algebra, the bases for some basic\nanswers and precedents that deal with weak compactness versus Hilbert spaces are\nmore than half a century old. Bartle et al . [3] show that a weakly compact operator\nT on X comes with a measure, a positive linear form, that controls the behaviour\nof T in a useful way. Once there is a measure, an L2-space is not far behind.\nOn the other hand, given an abstract Hilbert space H and a bounded linear map\nT : X \u2192 H, we have a bounded bilinear form (x, y) \u0002\u2192 (Tx | Ty\u2217), whose nature is\nlargely explained by the so-called little Grothendieck inequality dating back to [10],\nagain yielding measures and L2-norms.\nWith the growth of non-commutative (also vector-valued) measure theory, vast\nnew areas were cultivated, but here we con\ufb01ne our attention to only one line of\ndevelopment. In [14] Jarchow showed, generalizing an approach due to Jarchow\nand Pe\u0002lczyn\u00b4ski which was already seen in the commutative case in [13], that, for a\nC\u2217-algebra A and a Banach space Y , a linear map T : A \u2192 Y is weakly compact\nif and only if there exist a Hilbert space H, a bounded linear map Q : A \u2192 H\nand, for each \u03b5 > 0, a number N(\u03b5) > 0 such that \u2016Tx\u2016 \u0001 N(\u03b5)\u2016Qx\u2016 + \u03b5\u2016x\u2016 for\nall x \u2208 A. The proof hinges on the non-commutative extension, due to [1], of the\nBartle\u2013Dunford\u2013Schwartz control measure result, thereby producing the required\nHilbert space as an analogue of an L2-space.\nIf one wants to extend Jarchow\u2019s theorem to (at least some) more general Banach\nspaces than just C\u2217-algebras, the \ufb01rst step is to replace the non-commutative control\nmeasure result of Akemann by a pure Banach-space condition. In Akemann\u2019s work,\na key role is played by seminorms of the form x \u0002\u2192 \u03c6(x\u2217x + xx\u2217)1\/2, where \u03c6\nranges over the positive linear forms on the C\u2217-algebra. While this looks like a\nspeci\ufb01c C\u2217-algebra situation, from the point of view of locally convex topologies it\nis not. Indeed, as a consequence of the non-commutative generalization of the little\nGrothendieck inequality [12, 20], the locally convex topology on a C\u2217-algebra A\ngenerated by the seminorms x \u0002\u2192 \u03c6(x\u2217x+xx\u2217)1\/2 coincides with the one generated\nby all seminorms of the form x \u0002\u2192 \u2016Sx\u2016, where it is required that S is a bounded\nlinear map from A into a Hilbert space. (There is an analogous theory for JB\u2217-\ntriples; we give a brief discussion in \u00a7 3.)\nIf A is a C\u2217-algebra, the locally convex topology on A generated by the seminorms\nof the form x \u0002\u2192 \u03c6(x\u2217x + xx\u2217)1\/2, where \u03c6 ranges over the positive linear forms\non A, is the same as the strong\u2217 operator topology in the universal representation\nof A (and actually agrees with the \u03c3-strong\u2217 operator topology in this particular\ncase). It is induced by what Sakai calls the strong\u2217 topology of the W \u2217-algebra\nA\u2217\u2217 [24, p. 20] (denoted by s\u2217(A\u2217\u2217, A\u2217)). In keeping with this tradition, for any\nWeakly compact operators and the strong\u2217 topology 1251\nBanach space X, we call the topology denoted by P(\u03932)(X) the strong\u2217 topology\nand denote it by s\u2217(X,X\u2217) or simply by s\u2217(X).\nWe now discuss the topology denoted by P(W)(X) above. It is known that\nidentifying X with its canonical embedding in X\u2217\u2217, the P(W)(X) topology agrees\nwith the relative topology induced on X by the Mackey topology, m(X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217), of\nX\u2217\u2217. There are various ways of seeing this. One way is to reduce it, by a method\nappearing in proposition 2.2 of [17], to proposition 2 \u00a7 4 of [18]. Another proof is\ngiven in [27]. Jarchow [14, p. 343] states this as \u2018clear\u2019 in the C\u2217-algebra context\nthat he studied. In [19] the topology on X induced by m(X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217) was called the\nright topology; it was there shown that the weakly compact operators from X to\nany Banach space Y are precisely those which are continuous from this topology to\nthe norm topology of Y . After the publication of [19], Ruess kindly pointed out to us\nthat this result (in fact, the equivalence of parts (i), (ii) and (iii) of [19, corollary 5])\nfollows as a consequence of proposition 2.6 and theorem 3.2 of [22], proved there in\na more general setting.\nHere we use the notation \u03c1(X) or \u03c1(X,X\u2217) for P(W)(X) (see \u00a7 2 for an elabora-\ntion), but make a slight modi\ufb01cation in the terminology: the relative m(X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217)-\ntopology will be called the weak compactness right or w-right topology on X.\nWe shall also have occasion to consider the strong\u2217 and w-right topologies in a\nrestricted sense. Throughout the paper, F denotes a closed separating subspace of\nthe dual X\u2217 of X. We denote by \u03c1(X,F ) the locally convex topology of X generated\nby the seminorms x \u0002\u2192 \u2016Sx\u2016, where S is a \u03c3(X,F )-to-\u03c3(E,E\u2217) continuous (and\nhence, by the uniform boundedness principle, bounded) linear map from X to a\nre\ufb02exive Banach space E. Analogously, we obtain the topology s\u2217(X,F ) if, in this\ndescription, the words \u2018a re\ufb02exive Banach space\u2019 are replaced by \u2018a Hilbert space\u2019.\nThus, \u03c1(X,X\u2217) is simply the w-right topology of X and s\u2217(X,X\u2217) is its strong\u2217\ntopology. As noted before, we often denote s\u2217(X,X\u2217) just by s\u2217(X) and \u03c1(X,X\u2217)\nby \u03c1(X). (Note that our notation s\u2217(X,F ) is consistent with the notation used\nin [18] in a special case.)\nOne of the key results of [1] states that, for a von Neumann algebra M, the\nstrong\u2217 operator topology agrees with the Mackey topology m(M,M\u2217) on norm\nbounded subsets of M. If a C\u2217-algebra A is embedded in its second dual, this\nshows that the topologies s\u2217(A) and \u03c1(A) coincide on bounded sets. A fundamental\nquestion to be studied in this paper is to what extent this state of a\ufb00airs carries\nover to more general Banach spaces.\nThe philosophy is that when a general Banach space X has the property that\ns\u2217(X) and \u03c1(X) coincide on the norm closed unit ball of X, then we may expect that\nX will have some of the good (Banach space) behaviour of operator algebras. We\ngive a large class of Banach spaces for which these topologies coincide on their unit\nball; this class includes C\u2217-algebras, JB\u2217-triples, spaces of bounded linear operators\nbetween Hilbert spaces and some other classical spaces.\nNotation. Throughout the rest of the paper, unless speci\ufb01ed, X will stand for a\ngeneral Banach space, while F will denote an arbitrary closed separating subspace\nof the dual X\u2217 of X. The closed unit ball of X will be denoted by BX with a similar\nusage for other Banach spaces. Unless stated otherwise or clear from the context,\nthe scalar \ufb01eld may be either R of C; we may use for them the common name K.\n1252 A. M. Peralta, I. Villanueva, J. D. M. Wright and K. Ylinen\n2. Basic properties of the strong\u2217 and w-right topologies\nFor the convenience of the reader we give a quick proof for the following observation,\nthough it can also be deduced from the much more general ideas in the theory of\noperator ideals presented in [26].\nProposition 2.1. Let Y be a Banach space and let T : X \u2192 Y be a linear map.\nThe following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) the map T is s\u2217(X,F )-to-norm continuous;\n(ii) there is a Hilbert space H with a \u03c3(X,F )-to-\u03c3(H,H\u2217)-continuous linear map\nR : X \u2192 H and a bounded linear map S : H \u2192 Y such that T = SR.\nProof. Since \u2016SRx\u2016 \u0001 \u2016S\u2016\u2016Rx\u2016, it is clear that (ii) implies (i). Assume (i). Then\nthere are Hilbert spaces H1, . . . , Hn and \u03c3(X,F )-to-\u03c3(H,H\u2217)-continuous linear\nmaps Ri : X \u2192 Hi such that \u2016Tx\u2016 \u0001 max1\u0001i\u0001n \u2016Rix\u2016 for all x \u2208 X. Consider\nthe \u00062-direct sum H\u02dc = H1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Hn and de\ufb01ne the linear map R : X \u2192 H\u02dc by\nRx = (R1x, . . . , Rnx). We regard R as mapping X into the closure H of T (X).\nIt is easy to see that T is \u03c3(X,F )-to-\u03c3(H,H\u2217) continuous. Clearly, \u2016Tx\u2016 \u0001 \u2016Rx\u2016\nfor all x \u2208 X, so that we obtain a well-de\ufb01ned bounded linear map S\u02dc : R(X) \u2192 Y\nsatisfying S\u02dc(Rx) = Tx for all x \u2208 X. Now de\ufb01ne S as the continuous extension of\nS to H.\nCorollary 2.2. The topology s\u2217(X,F ) is compatible with the duality (X,F ).\nProof. Suppose f : X \u2192 K is an s\u2217(X,F )-continuous linear functional. The pre-\nceding result yields the existence of a Hilbert space H with a \u03c3(X,F )-to-\u03c3(H,H\u2217)-\ncontinuous linear map R : X \u2192 H and a bounded (hence \u03c3(H,H\u2217)-continuous)\nlinear functional g : H \u2192 C such that f = g \u25e6 R. Thus, f is \u03c3(X,F ) continuous.\nThe converse is even more obvious.\nIn a special case the above corollary was also proved by a di\ufb00erent method in [18,\ncorollary 9].\nWe omit the easy proof of the following result.\nProposition 2.3. Let Z be a topological vector space. For a linear map V : Z \u2192 X\nthe following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) V is continuous when X is equipped with the topology s\u2217(X,F );\n(ii) the composite map RV is continuous from Z to the norm topology of H when-\never H is a Hilbert space and R : X \u2192 H is a \u03c3(X,F )-to-\u03c3(H,H\u2217)-continuous\nlinear map.\nRemark 2.4. We have seen that the topology s\u2217(X,F ) has the following property:\nfor any Banach space Y and a linear map T : X \u2192 Y , T is s\u2217(X,F )-to-norm\ncontinuous if and only if T has a factorization T = SR through a Hilbert space\nH with R : X \u2192 H a \u03c3(X,F )-to-\u03c3(H,H\u2217)-continuous linear map and S : H \u2192 Y\na bounded linear map. We are not claiming that s\u2217(X,F ) is the only such vector\nspace topology, but it is certainly the weakest. Indeed, suppose that the topology \u03c4\nWeakly compact operators and the strong\u2217 topology 1253\nmakes X into a topological vector space with just the property that whenever H is\na Hilbert space with a \u03c3(X,F )-to-\u03c3(H,H\u2217)-continuous linear map R : X \u2192 H and\na bounded linear map S : H \u2192 Y into a Banach space Y , then SR is \u03c4 -to-norm\ncontinuous. Whenever H is a Hilbert space, any \u03c3(X,F )-to-\u03c3(H,H\u2217)-continuous\nlinear map may be composed with the identity map of H and is therefore \u03c4 -to-norm\ncontinuous. Applying the preceding proposition to the identity map on X we thus\nsee that \u03c4 is \ufb01ner than s\u2217(X,F ).\nWe now consider an alternative, equivalent, approach to de\ufb01ne s\u2217(X,F ) by means\nof sesquilinear forms rather than operators. The proof generalizes an argument in\nthe proof of [21, corollary 1].\nProposition 2.5. For any mapping \u0393 : X \u00d7 X \u2192 K the following conditions are\nequivalent:\n(i) \u0393 is a (conjugate-symmetric) sesquilinear form which is separately \u03c3(X,F )\ncontinuous and is positive (i.e. \u0393 (x, x) \u0002 0 for all x \u2208 X);\n(ii) there is a Hilbert space H (with inner product (\u00b7 | \u00b7)) and a \u03c3(X,F )-to-\n\u03c3(H,H\u2217)-continuous linear map T : X \u2192 H such that\n\u0393 (x, y) = (Tx | Ty),\nfor all x, y \u2208 X.\nIn this situation T is a bounded linear map and \u0393 is jointly norm continuous.\nProof. Implication (ii) =\u21d2 (i) is immediate. Now assume (i). De\ufb01ne\nN = {x \u2208 X | \u0393 (x, x) = 0}.\nThe Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality may be used to show that N is a linear subspace\nof X, and there is a well-de\ufb01ned inner product on the quotient space X\/N such\nthat (x + N | y + N) = \u0393 (x, y) for all x, y \u2208 X. Let H be the Hilbert space\ncompletion of the inner product space H0 = X\/N , and de\ufb01ne Tx = x + N . From\nthe uniform boundedness principle it follows that \u0393 is jointly norm continuous,\nand thus there is a constant M > 0 such that \u2016Tx\u20162 = \u0393 (x, x) \u0001 M\u2016x\u20162, and so\nT is a bounded linear map. We may identify H with H\u2217 via the conjugate linear\nbijection x \u0002\u2192 (\u00b7 | x). Since \u0393 is separately \u03c3(X,F ) continuous, T is then \u03c3(X,F )-\nto-\u03c3(H,H0) continuous, and so its adjoint T \u2217 : H\u2217 \u2192 X\u2217 maps H0 into E. But\nsince T \u2217 is norm continuous, it maps H\u2217, the closure of H0, into F , and so T is\n\u03c3(X,F )-to-\u03c3(H,H\u2217)-continuous.\nIn what follows we only consider the cases F = X\u2217 or F = X\u2217, where X\u2217 is some\nBanach space having X as its dual. (We use the notation X\u2217 for a predual of X, \ufb01xed\nin the given context, though X need not have a unique predual.) Proposition 2.5\nyields an alternative characterization in terms of positive sesquilinear forms. In\nthe case where E = X\u2217 it is clearly equivalent to replace the \u03c3(X,X\u2217)-to-weak\ncontinuity condition in the de\ufb01nition by the requirement of norm continuity. If\nE = X\u2217, we call \u03c3(X,X\u2217)-to-weak continuity brie\ufb02y weak\u2217 continuity.\n1254 A. M. Peralta, I. Villanueva, J. D. M. Wright and K. Ylinen\nUsing corollary 2.2 we see that whenever X and Y are Banach spaces (respec-\ntively, dual Banach spaces) then a linear map T : X \u2192 Y is norm continuous or,\nequivalently, weakly continuous (respectively, weak\u2217\u2013weak\u2217 continuous) if and only\nif it is s\u2217(X,X\u2217)-to-s\u2217(Y, Y \u2217) continuous (respectively, s\u2217(X,X\u2217)-to-s\u2217(Y, Y\u2217) con-\ntinuous). (See part (vi) of remark 5.8 for more details).\nIt is natural to ask whether s\u2217(X) actually is the same as some well-known\ntopology. Proposition 2.7 rules out one candidate.\nLemma 2.6. Let X be an in\ufb01nite-dimensional Banach space. Then there exists a\nbounded linear operator T : X \u2192 \u00062 with in\ufb01nite-dimensional range.\nProof. Let {\u03c6n}n\u2208N be a linearly independent bounded subset in X\u2217. The operator\nT : X \u2192 \u00062, T (x) := (n\u22121\u03c6n(x))\nsatis\ufb01es the claim.\nProposition 2.7. Let X be a Banach space. If s\u2217(X,X\u2217) coincides with the weak\ntopology on X, then X is \ufb01nite dimensional.\nProof. Suppose that the s\u2217(X,X\u2217)-topology coincides with the weak topology on\nX. Let T be a bounded linear operator from X into a Hilbert space H. The set\nO := {x \u2208 X : \u2016T (x)\u2016 < 1} is an s\u2217(X,X\u2217) neighbourhood of 0, and hence, by\nhypothesis, a weak neighbourhood of 0. Thus, there exist \u03c61, . . . , \u03c6k \u2208 X\u2217 such\nthat\nO \u2283 {x \u2208 X : |\u03c6j(x)| \u0001 1 for all j = 1, . . . , k}.\nTherefore, for each x \u2208 X it follows that\n\u2016T (x)\u2016 \u0001\nk\u2211\nj=1\n|\u03c6j(x)|,\nwhich implies that ker(T ) \u2283 \u22c2kj=1 ker(\u03c6j). Hence, T must have a \ufb01nite-dimensional\nrange since ker(T ) is \ufb01nite codimensional. This shows that every bounded linear\noperator from X into a Hilbert space has \ufb01nite rank. Lemma 2.6 now gives the\nstatement of the proposition.\nBecause of the formal similarity of the de\ufb01nitions, many properties of the strong\u2217\ntopology have obvious analogues in the weak compactness right case. The proofs\nmay be adapted with trivial changes, so we omit them. (Of course, remark 2.4 will\nhave an obvious analogue, too.)\nProposition 2.8. Let Y be a Banach space and let T : X \u2192 Y be a linear map.\nThe following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) T is \u03c1(X,F )-to-norm continuous;\n(ii) there exist a re\ufb02exive Banach space E and a \u03c3(X,F )-to-\u03c3(E,E\u2217)-continuous\nlinear map R : X \u2192 E and a bounded linear map S : E \u2192 Y such that T =\nSR.\nCorollary 2.9. The topology \u03c1(X,F ) is compatible with the duality (X,F ).\nWeakly compact operators and the strong\u2217 topology 1255\nProposition 2.10. Let Z be a topological vector space. For a linear map V : Z \u2192\nX the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) V is continuous when X is equipped with the topology \u03c1(X,F );\n(ii) the composite map RV is continuous from Z to the norm topology of E\nwhenever E is a re\ufb02exive space and R : X \u2192 E is a \u03c3(X,F )-to-\u03c3(E,E\u2217)-\ncontinuous linear map.\nIn [18, proposition 2, \u00a7 4] it was shown that if Y is a dual Banach space with a\npredual denoted by Y\u2217, then (in our present terminology) the topology \u03c1(Y, Y\u2217) is\nthe same as the Mackey topology m(Y, Y\u2217). Now take Y\u2217 = X\u2217 so that Y = X\u2217\u2217. For\na re\ufb02exive Banach space E the \u03c3(X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217)-to-\u03c3(E,E\u2217) linear maps from X into E\nare, by restriction, in a bijective correspondence with the bounded linear maps from\nX into E. From the quoted result of [18] it thus follows that \u03c1(X), i.e. \u03c1(X,X\u2217),\nis the same as the topology on X induced by the Mackey topology m(X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217).\nAs mentioned in \u00a7 1, this observation was published in [17, proposition 2.2], and a\ndi\ufb00erent proof was given in [27, corollary 4.2].\nSince F is a separating subspace of X\u2217, the mapping x \u0002\u2192 \u03c6x = \u03ba(x) from X\ninto F \u2217 de\ufb01ned by \u03c6x(f) = f(x) is injective (though in general not isometric).\nWe let \u03c1\u02dc(X,F ) denote the topology of X obtained when X is identi\ufb01ed with its\nimage under the map x \u0002\u2192 \u03c6x, and this image is given the topology induced by the\nMackey topology m(F, F \u2217). The next proposition generalizes the result discussed\nin the preceding paragraph.\nProposition 2.11. The topologies \u03c1(X,F ) and \u03c1\u02dc(X,F ) are the same.\nProof. Only a small modi\ufb01cation to the case of F = X\u2217 is needed. Since, for a re\ufb02ex-\nive Banach space E, the \u03c3(X,F )-to-\u03c3(E,E\u2217)-continuous linear maps T : X \u2192 E are\nin an obvious bijective correspondence with the \u03c3(F \u2217, F )-to-\u03c3(E,E\u2217)-continuous\nlinear maps from \u03ba(X) to F , one may again use the same techniques applied in [18,\nproposition 2, \u00a7 4].\n3. Background material on JB\u2217-triples and JBW\u2217-triples\nThe strong\u2217 topology in the setting of C\u2217-algebras and JB\u2217-triples is a well-known\ntool and it has been intensively developed especially during the last 15 years. In\nthis section we recall some of these developments.\nLet us recall that a JB\u2217-triple is a complex Banach space E equipped with a\ncontinuous triple product\n{\u00b7, \u00b7, \u00b7} : E \u00d7 E \u00d7 E \u2192 E,\n(x, y, z) \u0002\u2192 {x, y, z},\nwhich is bilinear and symmetric in the outer variables and conjugate linear in the\nmiddle one and satis\ufb01es the following:\n(i) (Jordan identity)\nL(x, y){a, b, c} = {L(x, y)a, b, c} \u2212 {a, L(y, x)b, c} + {a, b, L(x, y)c}\n1256 A. M. Peralta, I. Villanueva, J. D. M. Wright and K. Ylinen\nfor all x, y, a, b, c \u2208 E, where L(x, y) : E \u2192 E is the linear mapping given by\nL(x, y)z = {x, y, z};\n(ii) the map L(x, x) is a Hermitian operator with non-negative spectrum for all\nx \u2208 E;\n(iii) \u2016{x, x, x}\u2016 = \u2016x\u20163 for all x \u2208 E.\nEvery C\u2217-algebra is a JB\u2217-triple with respect to\n{x, y, z} := 2\u22121(xy\u2217z + zy\u2217x),\nevery JB\u2217-algebra is a JB\u2217-triple with triple product\n{a, b, c} = (a \u25e6 b\u2217) \u25e6 c+ (c \u25e6 b\u2217) \u25e6 a \u2212 (a \u25e6 c) \u25e6 b\u2217\nand the Banach space B(H,K) of all bounded linear operators between two complex\nHilbert spaces H,K is also an example of a JB\u2217-triple with respect to {R,S, T} =\n2\u22121(RS\u2217T + TS\u2217R).\nA JBW\u2217-triple is a JB\u2217-triple which is also a dual Banach space.\nGiven a JB\u2217-triple E, a norm-1 functional \u03c6 in E\u2217 and a norm-1 element e in\nE\u2217\u2217 with \u03c6(e) = 1, the mapping x \u0002\u2192 \u2016x\u2016\u03c6 = \u03c6{x, x, e}1\/2 de\ufb01nes a pre-Hilbertian\nseminorm on E which does not depend on the element e [4, proposition 1.2]. By\nthe classical little Grothendieck inequality for JB\u2217-triples we know that, when E\nis a JB\u2217-triple, s\u2217(E,E\u2217) coincides with the topology on E generated by all the\nseminorms of the form \u2016x\u2016\u03d5, where \u03d5 and e are norm-1 elements in E\u2217 and E\u2217\u2217,\nrespectively, and satisfy \u03d5(e) = 1 [18, \u00a7 4]. Moreover, when A is a C\u2217-algebra and\n\u03c6 is a positive functional in A\u2217, the mapping (x, y) \u0002\u2192 \u03c6(xy\u2217 + y\u2217x) also de\ufb01nes a\npositive sesquilinear form on A\u00d7A. The classical algebra strong\u2217 topology of A is\nthe topology on A generated by all the pre-Hilbertian seminorms of the form\n\u2016x\u20162\u03c6 := 2\u22121\u03c6(xx\u2217 + x\u2217x).\nIt follows, as a direct consequence of the so-called little Grothendieck inequality\n[12, 20], that the s\u2217(A,A\u2217) topology coincides with the classical algebra strong\u2217\ntopology of A.\n4. Unconditionally converging and\nquasi-completely continuous operators\nA series\n\u2211\nxn in a Banach space is called weakly unconditionally Cauchy (WUC)\nif there exists C > 0 such that, for any \ufb01nite subset F \u2282 N and \u03b5n = \u00b11, we have\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\n\u2211\nn\u2208F\n\u03b5nxn\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u0001 C.\nWe say that\n\u2211\nxn is unconditionally convergent if any subseries is norm converging.\nSince the s\u2217(X)-topology is coarser than \u03c1(X), every \u03c1(X)-convergent net in X is\nalso s\u2217(X)-convergent to the same limit. In [19, lemma 13] we proved that whenever\u2211\nn xn is a WUC series in a Banach space X, then (xn) is a \u03c1(X)-null sequence in\nX. These comments imply the following.\nWeakly compact operators and the strong\u2217 topology 1257\nLemma 4.1. Let X be a Banach space and let\n\u2211\nn xn be a WUC series in X. Then\n(xn) is an s\u2217(X)-null sequence in X.\nClearly, in general, an s\u2217(X)-null sequence in a Banach space X need not de\ufb01ne\na WUC series.\nWe recall here the following de\ufb01nition.\nDefinition 4.2. Let X and Y be Banach spaces and let T : X \u2192 Y be a linear\nmapping. We say that T is unconditionally converging if, for every WUC series\u2211\nn xn in X, the series\n\u2211\nn T (xn) is unconditionally convergent.\nLet us note the following well-known fact for later use: an operator T : X \u2192 Y\nis unconditionally converging if and only if, for every WUC series\n\u2211\nn xn in X, we\nhave \u2016T (xn)\u2016 \u2192 0. One of the implications is very easy. For the other implication\nit is enough to recall that, if T is not unconditionally converging, then T \u2018\ufb01xes a\ncopy of c0\u2019 [8, exercise V.8]; that is, there exists a WUC series\n\u2211\nxn \u2282 X such that\nthe sequence (T (xn))n is equivalent to the usual c0 basis.\nLet us also recall that a Banach space X is said to have Pe\u0002lczyn\u00b4ski\u2019s property\n(V ) if, for every Banach space Y , every unconditionally converging operator from\nX to Y is weakly compact.\nThe following de\ufb01nition is inspired by the concept of quasi-completely continuous\n(QCC) operators from a C\u2217-algebra to a Banach space given in [28, de\ufb01niton 2.1].\nWe shall see in corollary 5.9 that this de\ufb01nition is in fact equivalent, in the setting\nof C\u2217-algebras, to that introduced in [28].\nDefinition 4.3. Let X and Y be Banach spaces and T : X \u2192 Y a linear mapping.\nWe say that T is QCC if, for every s\u2217(X) Cauchy sequence xn in X, the sequence\n(T (xn)) is norm convergent.\nWe recall that a bounded linear operator T between two Banach spaces is called\ncompletely continuous if it maps weakly Cauchy sequences into norm convergent\nsequences.\nWe shall now give a counter-example showing that not every unconditionally con-\nverging operator is QCC. (A di\ufb00erent approach will be used later, in remark 5.11.)\nWe recall that a Banach space X is said to be an L\u221e space if there exists \u03bb \u0002 1 such\nthat every \ufb01nite-dimensional subspace M \u2282 X is contained in a \ufb01nite-dimensional\nspace F \u2282 X for which there exists an isomorphism T : F \u2192 \u0006dim(F )\u221e such that\n\u2016T\u2016\u2016T\u22121\u2016 < \u03bb. Let X be an L\u221e space without copies of c0 and with a copy of \u00062\n(the existence of such objects follows from [5]). Consider the identity in X. Since\nX does not contain c0, the identity in X is unconditionally converging. To see that\nit is not QCC we \ufb01rst need a simple lemma.\nLet 1 \u0001 p \u0001 \u221e. A sequence (xn) in a Banach space Y is said to be weakly\np-summable if, for every \u03c6 \u2208 Y \u2217, the scalar sequence (\u3008\u03c6, xn\u3009) is in \u0006p. In that case\nwe de\ufb01ne its p-weak norm by\n\u2016(xn)\u2016\u03c9p = sup\n\u2016\u03c6\u2016\u00011\n(\u2211\nn\n|\u3008\u03c6, xn\u3009|p\n)1\/p\n.\nIt is well known (and easy to prove) that (xn) is weakly p-summable if and only if\nthe operator \u0006p\u2032 \u2192 Y sending en = (\u03b4nk)k\u2208N to xn is bounded (here p\u2032 denotes the\n1258 A. M. Peralta, I. Villanueva, J. D. M. Wright and K. Ylinen\nconjugate of p, that is, 1\/p\u2032 +1\/p = 1; if p = 1, then c0 should replace \u0006\u221e). In fact,\nthe norm of that operator equals \u2016(xn)\u2016\u03c9p .\nWe recall that a bounded linear operator T between two Banach spaces, X and Y ,\nis p-summing if it takes weakly p-summable sequences into p-summable sequences;\nin that case, there exists a constant K > 0 satisfying\n( \u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u2016T (xn)\u2016p\n)1\/p\n\u0001 K\u2016(xn)\u2016wp\nfor every weakly p-summable sequence (xn) in X.\nLemma 4.4. If X is an L\u221e-space, every weakly 2-summable sequence (xn) in X is\ns\u2217(X)-null.\nProof. Let T : X \u2192 \u00062 be a bounded linear operator. By Grothendieck\u2019s inequality,\nT is 2-summing, and hence\n\u2211\nn\n\u2016T (xn)\u20162 \u0001 K\u2016(xn)\u2016w2 < \u221e.\nIn particular, T (xn) is norm-null.\nLet X again be an L\u221e-space without copies of c0 and with a copy of \u00062. We now\nconsider (xn) \u2282 X, a sequence equivalent to the usual \u00062 basis (such a sequence\nexists since X contains a copy of \u00062). By the preceding lemma, (xn) is strong\u2217-null,\nbut clearly not norm-null, which proves that the identity in X is not QCC.\nRemark 4.5. Let X be a Banach space satisfying the Dunford\u2013Pettis property.\nThen the topologies s\u2217(X,X\u2217) and \u03c1(X) on X have the same convergent sequences.\nIndeed, let (xn) be a (bounded) s\u2217(X,X\u2217)-convergent sequence in X with limit x0,\nand let T : X \u2192 R be a bounded linear operator from X into a re\ufb02exive Banach\nspace R. Since T is weakly compact and X has the Dunford\u2013Pettis property, then\nT is completely continuous, and hence T (xn\u2212x0) tends to zero in norm. This shows\nthat (xn) tends to x0 in the \u03c1(X)-topology.\nRemark 4.6. We would like to \ufb01nish this series of remarks by showing that the\ns\u2217(X,X\u2217) topology does not coincide, in general, with the weak nor weak\u2217 topology.\nConsider, for example, \u0006p with 1 \u0001 p < 2. Since the natural inclusion of \u0006p into \u00062\nis contractive, we deduce that the natural basis of \u0006p is a weakly null sequence that\nis never s\u2217(\u0006p, \u0006\u2217p)-null (see also proposition 2.7).\n5. When do the topologies s\u2217(X) and \u03c1(X) agree on\nbounded subsets of X?\nOur next step is to investigate the connections between the strong\u2217, Mackey and\nw-right topologies. By [18, proposition 2, \u00a7 4], we know that the Mackey topology\nm(Y, Y\u2217) coincides with the topology on Y generated by all the seminorms \u2016| \u00b7 |\u2016T ,\nwhere T is a weak\u2217-continuous linear operator from Y into a re\ufb02exive Banach space.\nThe next result was proved in [18, proposition 3].\nWeakly compact operators and the strong\u2217 topology 1259\nProposition 5.1. Let Y be a dual Banach space with a predual denoted by Y\u2217. The\nfollowing assertions are equivalent:\n(i) the topologies m(Y, Y\u2217) and s\u2217(Y, Y\u2217) coincide on bounded subsets of Y ;\n(ii) for every weak\u2217-continuous linear operator F from Y into a re\ufb02exive Banach\nspace, there exists a weak\u2217-continuous linear operator G from Y to a Hilbert\nspace satisfying \u2016F (x)\u2016 \u0001 \u2016G(x)\u2016 + \u2016x\u2016 for all x \u2208 Y ;\n(iii) for every weak\u2217-continuous linear operator F from Y into a re\ufb02exive Banach\nspace, there exist a weak\u2217-continuous linear operator G from Y to a Hilbert\nspace and a mapping N : (0,\u221e) \u2192 (0,\u221e) satisfying\n\u2016F (x)\u2016 \u0001 N(\u03b5)\u2016G(x)\u2016 + \u03b5\u2016x\u2016\nfor all x \u2208 Y and \u03b5 > 0.\nFrom [18, p. 621] (respectively, [1, theorem II.7]) it follows that when W is a\nJBW\u2217-triple (respectively, a von Neumann algebra) then the topologies m(W,W\u2217)\nand s\u2217(W,W\u2217) coincide on bounded subsets of W . When JBW\u2217-triples and von Neu-\nmann algebras are replaced with JB\u2217-triples and C\u2217-algebras, respectively, the\nstrong\u2217-topology and the w-right topology coincide on the unit ball. The following\nproposition shows that an analogous result is true for general Banach spaces. We\nshould note that statements (ii) and (iii) in the following proposition were proved\nwhen X is a C\u2217-algebra in [14].\nProposition 5.2. Let X be a Banach space. Then the following assertions are\nequivalent:\n(i) the w-right topology and the s\u2217(X,X\u2217)-topology coincide on bounded subsets\nof X;\n(ii) the topologies m(X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217) and s\u2217(X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217) coincide on bounded subsets of\nX\u2217\u2217;\n(iii) for every bounded linear operator F from X to a re\ufb02exive Banach space, there\nexist a bounded linear operator G from X to a Hilbert space and a mapping\nN : (0,\u221e) \u2192 (0,\u221e) satisfying\n\u2016F (x)\u2016 \u0001 N(\u03b5)\u2016G(x)\u2016 + \u03b5\u2016x\u2016\nfor all x \u2208 X and \u03b5 > 0;\n(iv) for every bounded linear operator F from X to a re\ufb02exive Banach space,\nthere exists a bounded linear operator G from X to a Hilbert space satisfying\n\u2016F (x)\u2016 \u0001 \u2016G(x)\u2016 + \u2016x\u2016 for all x \u2208 X.\nProof. (i) =\u21d2 (ii). As we have already noted, every s\u2217(X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217)-neighbourhood\nof 0 in X\u2217\u2217 is also an m(X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217)-neighbourhood of 0 in X\u2217\u2217. To see the converse\ninclusion, let O\u2032 be a relative m(X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217)-neighbourhood of 0 in BX\u2217\u2217 . As we have\nalready noted, it follows from [18, proposition 2] that m(X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217) coincides with\nthe topology on X\u2217\u2217 generated by all the seminorms x \u0002\u2192 \u2016T (x)\u2016, where T is a\n1260 A.

Ylinen\nweak\u2217-to-weak continuous linear operator from X\u2217\u2217 into a re\ufb02exive Banach space.\nWe may therefore assume that O\u2032 is of the form\nO\u2032 = {x \u2208 BX\u2217\u2217 : \u2016T (x)\u2016 \u0001 \u03b4},\nwhere T : X\u2217\u2217 \u2192 R is a weak\u2217-continuous linear operator from X\u2217\u2217 into a re\ufb02exive\nBanach space and \u03b4 is a positive constant. Thus, there exists S : R\u2217 \u2192 X\u2217 satisfying\nS\u2217 = T . It can easily be checked that S is \u03c3(R\u2217, R)-to-\u03c3(X\u2217, X) continuous. In\nparticular, we can \ufb01nd a bounded linear operator U : X \u2192 R such that U\u2217\u2217 = T .\nThe set\nO = {x \u2208 BX : \u2016U(x)\u2016 \u0001 \u03b4}\nis a relative w-right-neighbourhood of 0 in BX . Since, by hypothesis, the w-right\ntopology and the s\u2217(X,X\u2217)-topology coincide on bounded subsets of X, there exist\nbounded linear operators G1, . . . , Gk, from X into Hilbert spaces H1, . . . , Hk, such\nthat\nO \u2287 {x \u2208 BX : \u2016Gi(x)\u2016 \u0001 \u03b4 for all 1 \u0001 i \u0001 k}. (5.1)\nClearly, G\u2217\u2217i : X\n\u2217\u2217 \u2192 Hi is a weak\u2217-continuous operator. We claim that\nO\u2032 \u2287 {x \u2208 BX\u2217\u2217 : \u2016G\u2217\u2217i (x)\u2016 \u0001 12\u03b4 for all 1 \u0001 i \u0001 k}.\nIndeed, let z be an element in the right-hand set. Since the s\u2217(X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217) topology is\ncompatible with the duality (X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217), then, by Goldstine\u2019s and bipolar theorems,\nthere exists a net (x\u03bb) in BX converging to z in the s\u2217(X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217) topology of X\u2217\u2217.\nThus, for each 1 \u0001 i \u0001 k,\n\u2016Gi(x\u03bb)\u2016 = \u2016G\u2217\u2217i (x\u03bb)\u2016 \u2192 \u2016G\u2217\u2217i (z)\u2016 \u0001 12\u03b4. (5.2)\nTherefore, there exists \u03bb0 such that, for each \u03bb \u0002 \u03bb0, we have \u2016Gi(x\u03bb)\u2016 < \u03b4 for all\n1 \u0001 i \u0001 k, which shows, by (5.1), that x\u03bb \u2208 O; equivalently, \u2016U(x\u03bb)\u2016 \u0001 \u03b4 for each\n\u03bb \u0002 \u03bb0.\nSince the net (x\u03bb)\u03bb\u0002\u03bb0 also converges in the weak\n\u2217 topology of X\u2217\u2217 to z and the\nnorm is weak\u2217 lower semi-continuous, we have\n\u2016T (z)\u2016 \u0001 lim inf\n\u03bb\u0002\u03bb0\n\u2016T (x\u03bb)\u2016 = lim inf\n\u03bb\u0002\u03bb0\n\u2016U\u2217\u2217(x\u03bb)\u2016 = lim inf\n\u03bb\u0002\u03bb0\n\u2016U(x\u03bb)\u2016 \u0001 \u03b4.\nThis proves that z \u2208 O\u2032 and proves the claim. Therefore, O\u2032 contains the set\n{x \u2208 BX\u2217\u2217 : \u2016G\u2217\u2217i (x)\u2016 \u0001 12\u03b4 for all 1 \u0001 i \u0001 k},\nand hence O\u2032 is a relative s\u2217(X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217)-neighbourhood of 0 in BX\u2217\u2217 .\n(ii) =\u21d2 (iii). Let F : X \u2192 R and G : X\u2217\u2217 \u2192 H be bounded linear operators\nfrom X and X\u2217\u2217 into a re\ufb02exive Banach space and a Hilbert space, respectively.\nSuppose that G is weak\u2217 continuous. Since F \u2217\u2217 : X\u2217\u2217 \u2192 R is a weak\u2217 continuous\nlinear operator and there exists a bounded linear operator U : X \u2192 H satisfying\nU\u2217\u2217 = G, then statement (iii) follows from (ii) via proposition 5.1.\nThe implication (iii) =\u21d2 (iv) is clear.\nWeakly compact operators and the strong\u2217 topology 1261\n(iv) =\u21d2 (ii). Let T : X\u2217\u2217 \u2192 R be a weak\u2217-continuous linear operator from X\u2217\u2217\ninto a re\ufb02exive Banach space. According to what we have seen in the proof of\n(i) =\u21d2 (ii), there exists a bounded linear operator U : X \u2192 R satisfying U\u2217\u2217 = T .\nBy hypothesis, there exists a bounded linear operator G from X to a Hilbert space,\nH, satisfying\n\u2016U(x)\u2016 \u0001 \u2016G(x)\u2016 + \u2016x\u2016 (5.3)\nfor all x \u2208 X. Clearly, G\u2217\u2217 : X\u2217\u2217 \u2192 H is a weak\u2217-continuous operator. Let z \u2208\nX\u2217\u2217\\{0}. Since the s\u2217(X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217)-topology is compatible with the duality (X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217),\nthere exists a net (x\u03bb) in \u2016z\u2016BX converging to z in the s\u2217(X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217) topology of\nX\u2217\u2217. Thus,\n\u2016G(x\u03bb)\u2016 = \u2016G\u2217\u2217(x\u03bb)\u2016 \u2192 \u2016G\u2217\u2217(z)\u2016. (5.4)\nSince the net (x\u03bb) also converges in the weak\u2217 topology of X\u2217\u2217 to z, and the norm\nis weak\u2217 lower semicontinuous, we have\n\u2016T (z)\u2016 \u0001 lim inf \u2016T (x\u03bb)\u2016 = lim inf \u2016U\u2217\u2217(x\u03bb)\u2016 = lim inf \u2016U(x\u03bb)\u2016.\nFinally, we deduce from (5.3) and (5.4) that\n\u2016T (z)\u2016 \u0001 \u2016G\u2217\u2217(z)\u2016 + \u2016z\u2016\nfor all z \u2208 X\u2217\u2217, which implies, by proposition 5.1, that the topologies m(X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217)\nand s\u2217(X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217) coincide on bounded subsets of X\u2217\u2217 .\nFinally, the implication (ii) =\u21d2 (i) is clear.\nRemark 5.3. We have already seen that when W is a JBW\u2217-triple or a von Neu-\nmann algebra then the topologies m(W,W\u2217) and s\u2217(W,W\u2217) coincide on bounded\nsubsets of W (see [1, theorem II.7] and [18, p. 621], respectively). Since, by [9], the\nbidual of every JB\u2217-triple (respectively, C\u2217-algebra) is a JBW\u2217-triple (respectively,\na von Neumann algebra), proposition 5.2 guarantees that for every JB\u2217-triple, E,\nthe w-right topology and the s\u2217(E,E\u2217) topology coincide on bounded subsets of\nE. In particular, this is true when E is a C\u2217-algebra.\nThe next lemma gives su\ufb03cient conditions to guarantee that, in a Banach space\nX, the s\u2217(X)-topology and the \u03c3(X,X\u2217)-topology coincide on bounded sets of X.\nLemma 5.4. Let X be a Banach space. Suppose that every bounded conjugate linear\noperator T from X to X\u2217 is compact. Then the s\u2217(X) topology coincides with the\n\u03c3(X,X\u2217) topology on bounded sets of X.\nProof. We have already seen that the s\u2217(X)-topology is compatible with the duality\n(X,X\u2217). Therefore, every s\u2217(X)-null net in X is automatically weakly null. To see\nthe other implication, let (x\u03bb) be a bounded weakly null net in X. We may assume\nthat \u2016x\u03bb\u2016 \u0001 1 for all \u03bb.\nLet \u0393 : X \u00d7 X \u2192 K be a (norm) continuous positive sesquilinear form on X.\nLet T : X \u2192 X\u2217 be the bounded conjugate-linear operator de\ufb01ned by T (y)(x) :=\n\u0393 (x, y), x, y \u2208 X. By hypothesis, T is compact.\nLet N := {x \u2208 X | \u0393 (x, x) = 0}. As we have seen before, the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz\ninequality may be used to show that N is a linear subspace of X and that there is a\n1262 A. M. Peralta, I. Villanueva, J. D. M. Wright and K. Ylinen\nwell-de\ufb01ned inner product on the quotient space X\/N such that (x+N | y+N) =\n\u0393 (x, y) for all x, y \u2208 X. Let H denote the Hilbert space completion of the inner\nproduct space H0 = X\/N . The operator R : X \u2192 H, R(x) := x+N , is continuous.\nWe claim that R is compact. Indeed, let (yn) be a sequence in the closed unit ball\nof X. Since T is compact, there exists a subsequence (y\u03c3(n)) such that T (y\u03c3(n)) is\nnorm convergent. The formula\n\u2016R(y\u03c3(n)) \u2212 R(y\u03c3(m))\u20162 = \u2016y\u03c3(n) \u2212 y\u03c3(m) +N\u20162\n= \u0393 (y\u03c3(n) \u2212 y\u03c3(n), y\u03c3(n) \u2212 y\u03c3(m))\n\u0001 \u2016T (y\u03c3(n) \u2212 y\u03c3(m))\u2016\u2016y\u03c3(n) \u2212 y\u03c3(m)\u2016\n\u0001 2\u2016T (y\u03c3(n)) \u2212 T (y\u03c3(m))\u2016\nshows that (R(y\u03c3(n))) is a Cauchy sequence in H, and hence R is compact.\nSince every Hilbert space has the approximation property, given \u03b5 > 0, there\nexists a \ufb01nite rank operator F : X \u2192 H such that \u2016R\u2212F\u2016 < 12\u03b5. Since F has \ufb01nite\nrank and (x\u03bb) is weakly null, there exists \u03bb0 such that, for every \u03bb \u0002 \u03bb0, we have\n\u2016F (x\u03bb)\u2016 < 12\u03b5. Finally, for each \u03bb \u0002 \u03bb0, it follows that\n\u2016R(x\u03bb)\u2016 \u0001 \u2016(R \u2212 F )(x\u03bb)\u2016 + \u2016F (x\u03bb)\u2016 < \u03b5,\nwhich implies that\n\u221a\n\u0393 (x\u03bb, x\u03bb) = \u2016x\u03bb +N\u2016 = \u2016R(x\u03bb)\u2016 \u2212\u2192\n\u03bb\n0.\nThis implies that, for each \u0393 as above, we have\n\u0393 (x\u03bb, x\u03bb) \u2212\u2192\n\u03bb\n0.\nSince the s\u2217(X) topology is de\ufb01ned by all the continuous positive sesquilinear forms\n\u0393 on X \u00d7 X, we deduce that (x\u03bb) also is s\u2217(X,X\u2217)-null.\nLet X and Y be two complex Banach spaces such that every linear operator\nT : X \u2192 Y is compact. If there exists a conjugate-linear isomorphism J : Y \u2192 Y ,\nthen every conjugate-linear operator R : X \u2192 Y is also compact.\nLet 2 < p < +\u221e. We have seen in the above remark that weakly-null and\ns\u2217(\u0006p, \u0006\u2217p)-null sequences coincide on \u0006p. We can now see that both topologies are in\nfact the same on bounded sets. Denote \u0006\u2217p = \u0006q for a suitable q. In this case we have\nq < p and hence, by Pitt\u2019s theorem, every bounded linear operator T : \u0006p \u2192 \u0006\u2217p = \u0006q\n(and every T : c0 \u2192 c\u22170 = \u00061) is compact. This fact together with the above lemma\nand comments show that, for each 2 < p < +\u221e, s\u2217(\u0006p, \u0006\u2217p) coincides with \u03c3(\u0006p, \u0006\u2217p)\n(respectively, s\u2217(c0, c\u22170) coincides with \u03c3(c0, c\n\u2217\n0)) on bounded sets of \u0006p (respectively,\nc0).\nThe strong\u2217 topology in a von Neumann algebra or in a JBW\u2217-triple has proved\nto be a very good tool for characterizing relatively weakly compact subsets in their\nrespective preduals (see, for example, [1, 2, 16, 23, 25]). The following proposition\ngeneralizes the cited results to the class of Banach spaces Y in which the topologies\ns\u2217(Y \u2217\u2217, Y \u2217) and \u03c1(Y ) coincide on bounded subsets.\nWeakly compact operators and the strong\u2217 topology 1263\nProposition 5.5. Let X be a Banach space such that the s\u2217(X,X\u2217) and w-right\ntopologies coincide on bounded subsets of X, and let K be a bounded subset of X\u2217.\nThen K is relatively weakly compact if and only if there exists a bounded linear\noperator R from X into a Hilbert space with the following property: for every \u03b5 > 0,\nthere exists \u03b4 > 0 such that, for each x \u2208 X with \u2016x\u2016 \u0001 1 and \u2016R(x)\u2016 < \u03b4, we have\n|\u03d5(x)| < \u03b5 for all \u03d5 \u2208 K.\nProof. Let us assume that the operator condition is satis\ufb01ed for K. Let K\u02dc denote\nthe w\u2217-closed absolutely convex hull of K. Given \u03b5 > 0, by assumption, there exists\na weakly compact absolutely convex subset W\u03b4(\u03b5) \u2282 X\u2217 such that\n(\n1\n\u03b5\nK\u02dc\n)\u25e6\n= \u03b5K\u25e6 \u2283 {x \u2208 BX : \u2016R(x)\u2016 < \u03b4} \u2283 BX \u2229 (W\u03b4(\u03b5))\u25e6\n= (BX\u2217)\u25e6 \u2229 (W\u03b4(\u03b5))\u25e6\n= (BX\u2217 \u222a W\u03b4(\u03b5))\u25e6,\nwhere A\u25e6 denotes the polar of the set A. Hence,\n1\n\u03b5\nK\u02dc =\n(\n1\n\u03b5\nK\u02dc\n)\u25e6\u25e6\n\u2282 (BX\u2217 \u222a W\u03b4(\u03b5))\u25e6\u25e6 \u2282 BX\u2217 +W\u03b4(\u03b5),\nand thus K \u2282 K\u02dc \u2282 \u03b5BX\u2217 + \u03b5W\u03b4(\u03b5). According to [11, ch. 5, part 4, \u00a7 1, lemma 2],\na bounded subset B of a Banach space Z is relatively weakly compact if, for every\n\u03b5 > 0, there exists a weakly compact subset W\u03b5 of Z such that B \u2282 \u03b5BZ + W\u03b5.\nThis proves the su\ufb03ciency part.\nThe necessity part follows by a similar polarity argument.\nFor the class of Banach spaces X in which the w-right topology and the s\u2217(X,X\u2217)\ntopology coincide on bounded sets we have the following theorem.\nTheorem 5.6. Let X and Y be Banach spaces and let T : X \u2192 Y be a linear\nmapping. Suppose that the w-right and the s\u2217(X,X\u2217) topologies coincide on bounded\nsets of X and that X has property (V ). Then the following assertions are equivalent:\n(i) T is unconditionally converging;\n(ii) T is weakly compact;\n(iii) there exist a bounded linear operator G from X into a Hilbert space and a\nmapping N : (0,\u221e) \u2192 (0,\u221e) satisfying\n\u2016T \u2217\u2217(x)\u2016 \u0001 N(\u03b5)\u2016G\u2217\u2217(x)\u2016 + \u03b5\u2016x\u2016\nfor all x \u2208 X\u2217\u2217 and \u03b5 > 0;\n(iv) if (x\u03bb) is a bounded net in X\u2217\u2217 converging to some element x \u2208 X\u2217\u2217 in the\ns\u2217(X\u2217\u2217, X\u2217) topology, then, for each \u03bb, T \u2217\u2217(x\u03bb) and T \u2217\u2217(x) are in Y and\n\u2016T \u2217\u2217(x\u03bb) \u2212 T \u2217\u2217(x)\u2016 converges to 0;\n(v) T is QCC.\n1264 A. M. Peralta, I. Villanueva, J. D. M. Wright and K. Ylinen\nProof. First, we recall that, in every Banach space, X, the norm topology is always\nstronger than the s\u2217(X,X\u2217) topology. So every quasi-completely continuous map-\nping from X to a Banach space is always norm continuous.\n(i) =\u21d2 (ii) follows by property (V ) on X.\nThe equivalence (ii) \u21d0\u21d2 (iii) follows from proposition 5.2.\n(iii) =\u21d2 (iv) and (iv) =\u21d2 (v) are clear.\n(v) =\u21d2 (i). Let \u2211xn be a WUC series in X. Since, by lemma 4.1, we have\n(xn) \u2192 0 in the s\u2217(X) topology, we deduce by hypothesis that \u2016T (xn)\u2016 \u2192 0,\nwhich shows that T is unconditionally converging by the remarks preceding this\ntheorem.\nRemark 5.7. In theorem 4 of [19] it is shown that, for a linear operator T between\ntwo Banach spaces X and Y , T is weakly compact if and only if T is continuous\nfrom BX (the unit ball) equipped with the right topology, into Y , equipped with the\nnorm topology. The latter statement could also be added to the list of equivalences\ngiven in the above theorem.\nRemark 5.8.\n\u2022 Note that the implication (v) =\u21d2 (i) above did not use any assumptions on\nX,Y . That is, every QCC linear operator is unconditionally converging.\n\u2022 There are unconditionally converging operators that are not quasi-completely\ncontinuous (see remark 5.11).\n\u2022 Every completely continuous operator is QCC. This follows easily from the\ntrivial fact that every s\u2217(X,X\u2217)-null sequence is clearly weakly null.\n\u2022 There exist QCC operators that are not completely continuous: consider, for\nexample, the identity in \u00062. Related to this, we observe that, when X = \u00062,\nwe \ufb01nd an analogue of Schur\u2019s lemma for the s\u2217(X,X\u2217) topology: if a net in\n\u00062 is strong\u2217-null, then it is also norm-null.\n\u2022 Not every QCC operator is weakly compact: take any completely continuous\nnot weakly compact operator; for example, the identity in \u00061. Related to this,\nit seems interesting to study the class of spaces X such that, for every Banach\nspace Y , every QCC operator T : X \u2192 Y is weakly compact.\n\u2022 Let X, Y and Z be Banach spaces. If T \u2208 L(X,Y ) is QCC and R : Y \u2192 Z and\nU : Z \u2192 X are bounded linear operators, then RT and TU are both QCC.\nTo see the latter, we simply observe that every U in L(Z,X) is s\u2217(Z,Z\u2217)-\nto-s\u2217(X,X\u2217) continuous. Indeed, for each Banach space B, s\u2217(B,B\u2217) is the\ntopology generated by all continuous positive sesquilinear forms \u0393 : B\u00d7B \u2192\nK (see proposition 2.5). Given a continuous positive sesquilinear form \u0393 on\nX\u00d7X, the mapping (z1, z2) \u0002\u2192 \u0393 (U(z1), U(z2)) also de\ufb01nes a continuous pos-\nitive sesquilinear form on Z\u00d7Z. This implies that U is s\u2217(Z,Z\u2217)\u2212s\u2217(X,X\u2217)\ncontinuous. In fact, we have that U is in L(Z,X) if and only if U is s\u2217(Z,Z\u2217)-\nto-s\u2217(X,X\u2217) continuous, since the s\u2217(B,B\u2217)-topology on a Banach space, B,\nis compatible with the duality (B,B\u2217).\nWeakly compact operators and the strong\u2217 topology 1265\nFor every JB\u2217-triple E, the w-right and s\u2217(E,E\u2217) topologies coincide on bounded\nsubsets of E (see remark 5.3). Since every JB\u2217-triple also satis\ufb01es property (V ) [6],\nthe next corollary now follows as a consequence of theorem 5.6.\nGiven two norm-1 continuous linear functionals, \u03d51 and \u03d52, in the dual space of\na JB\u2217-triple E, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u03d51,\u03d52 will stand for the pre-Hilbertian seminorm on E de\ufb01ned\nby\n\u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u03d51,\u03d52 :=\n\u221a\n\u2016 \u00b7 \u20162\u03d51 + \u2016 \u00b7 \u20162\u03d52 .\nCorollary 5.9. Let E be a JB\u2217-triple, let X be a Banach space and let T : E \u2192 X\nbe a linear mapping. Then all the statements in theorem 5.6 are equivalent for T .\nIn this particular setting they are also equivalent to the following:\n(iii\u2032) there exist a mapping N : (0,+\u221e) \u2192 (0,+\u221e) and \u03d51, \u03d52 in the unit sphere\nof E\u2217 such that, for each \u03b5 > 0 and \u03b1 \u2208 E\u2217\u2217, we have\n\u2016T \u2217\u2217(\u03b1)\u2016 \u0001 N(\u03b5)\u2016\u03b1\u2016\u03d51,\u03d52 + \u03b5\u2016\u03b1\u2016.\nTo see the equivalence with (iii\u2032) we need the Grothendieck inequality for JB\u2217-\ntriples [18, theorem 10]. Proposition 2.2 of [28] is also a direct consequence of the\nprevious theorem.\nWe have already given many examples of Banach spaces X for which the topolo-\ngies \u03c1(X) and s\u2217(X,X\u2217) coincide on bounded subsets of X. This class of examples\nincludes JB\u2217-triples, C\u2217-algebras and JB\u2217-algebras. We shall now show that this\nbehaviour remains true for some other classes of Banach spaces. We shall also\nstudy the relationships between quasi-completely continuous operators and some\nother classes of operators which have been investigated by many di\ufb00erent authors.\nWe shall start with re\ufb02exive Banach spaces. The next remark shows that, for a\nre\ufb02exive Banach space X, the topologies \u03c1(X) and s\u2217(X,X\u2217) coincide on bounded\nsubsets of X if and only if X is isomorphic to a Hilbert space.\nRemark 5.10. Let R be a re\ufb02exive Banach space. Suppose that the topologies\nm(R,R\u2217) and s\u2217(R,R\u2217) coincide on bounded subsets of R. In this case, proposi-\ntion 5.2(ii) applied to the operator T : R \u2192 R, x \u0002\u2192 2x shows that there exists a\nbounded linear operator G from R into a Hilbert space H satisfying\n2\u2016x\u2016 \u0001 \u2016G(x)\u2016 + \u2016x\u2016\nfor all x \u2208 R, which implies that R is isomorphic to a Hilbert space. That is,\nfor a re\ufb02exive Banach space R, the topologies m(R,R\u2217) and s\u2217(R,R\u2217) coincide on\nbounded subsets of R if and only if R is isomorphic to a Hilbert space. On the other\nhand, it is clear that the m(R,R\u2217) topology coincides with the norm topology on\nevery re\ufb02exive Banach space R.\nWe shall now deal with \u0006p spaces.\nRemark 5.11.\n\u2022 Let 2 < p < +\u221e. Pitt\u2019s theorem tells us that every operator T : \u0006p \u2192 \u00062 is\ncompact and hence completely continuous [15, proposition 2.c.3]. Therefore,\nevery weakly null sequence (xn) \u2282 \u0006p is s\u2217(\u0006p, \u0006\u2217p)-null. Since s\u2217(X,X\u2217)-null\n1266 A. M. Peralta, I. Villanueva, J. D. M. Wright and K. Ylinen\nsequences are weakly null for every Banach space X, we obtain that, on \u0006p,\np > 2, weakly null and s\u2217(\u0006p, \u0006\u2217p)-null sequences coincide. It follows that, for\nevery Banach space X and every p > 2, an operator\nT : \u0006p \u2192 X\nis completely continuous if and only if it is quasi-completely continuous.\n\u2022 Note that the identity mapping on \u0006p is a weakly compact operator, and\nhence is unconditionally converging, by the Orlicz\u2013Pettis theorem. However,\nit is not completely continuous (the canonical basis (en) is weakly null but not\nnorm-null), and therefore it is not quasi-completely continuous. This provides\na simple example of an unconditionally converging but not quasi-completely\ncontinuous operator.\n\u2022 We have already seen in the previous remark that the topologies s\u2217(\u0006p, \u0006\u2217p)\nand m(\u0006p, \u0006\u2217p) do not coincide on bounded subsets of \u0006p, 1 \u0001 p < \u221e, p \u0011= 2.\n\u2022 The above paragraphs show that the hypothesis of coincidence between the\ns\u2217(X) topology and the w-right topology on bounded subsets cannot be omit-\nted in the (ii) =\u21d2 (iii) part of theorem 5.6, even when X has property (V )\n(observe that every re\ufb02exive Banach space has property (V )).\nAcknowledgements\nA.M.P. was partly supported by I+D MCYT Project no.
