Introduction \n \n Over the past 20 years, there has been a great deal of interest from academic \neconomists and policy makers in the UK in the contribution of the housing market to regional \ndisparities in unemployment. Various features of the housing market have been investigated. \nEarly research focused on the effects of local authority housing policies, which were seen as \nan impediment to labour mobility, restricting the incentives for workers to move between \nregions in response to regional unemployment differentials (Hughes and McCormick, 1981; \nMinford et al., 1988; Pissarides and Wadsworth, 1989). The boom in the owner-occupied \nhousing market in the mid-to-late 1980s led to a change in emphasis, however. The emergence \nof significant regional house price differentials led to concerns over the creation of a \u2018North-\nSouth divide\u2019 within the economy and prompted a number of studies into the effect of these \ndifferentials on the pattern of inter-regional migration and the relationship between regional \nunemployment and vacancies (Bover et al., 1989; Hughes and McCormick, 1987; Muellbauer \nand Murphy, 1991; Jackman and Savouri, 1992).  \nIn the recession of the early 1990s, the collapse of the owner-occupied housing market \n\u2013 which was most acute in the South East of England \u2013 was seen by some as a major influence \non the regional pattern of unemployment growth, which appeared to differ from that observed \nin previous recessions (Bradley and Taylor, 1994; Evans and McCormick, 1994). Most \nrecently, Oswald (1996) suggests that patterns of home ownership and the incidence of private \nsector renting have an important role to play in accounting for regional disparities in the rate \nof unemployment.1  \n Despite this considerable body of research, there remains a great deal of uncertainty \nconcerning the role played by different features of the housing market in shaping the regional \npattern of unemployment. The aim in this paper is to try to gain a deeper understanding of this \n 3\nissue by examining the relationship between housing market factors and the pattern of flows \ninto and out of regional unemployment. Previous work in this area has concentrated \nexclusively on the relationship between the housing market and the unemployment stock. By \nfocusing instead on the analysis of unemployment flows, we aim to gain a better \nunderstanding of the ways in which housing market factors shape the development of regional \ndisparities in unemployment. \n There have in fact been relatively few studies of unemployment flows at the regional \nlevel. Martin and Sunley (1999) examine the extent to which variations in the pattern of flows \ninto and out of unemployment can account for the disparities in British regional \nunemployment rates, but do not attempt to explain the regional variation in flow rates. Robson \n(2001) examines the extent to which regional disparities in unemployment outflows rates are \ndue to differences in the rate of new hires or differences in the share of hires captured by the \nunemployed, and provides an empirical analysis of the factors that influence the latter. \nElsewhere, van Ours (1995) uses regional level data to study the determinants of outflows \nfrom unemployment in the Netherlands, while Anderson and Burgess (2000) examine state-\nlevel data for the United States.2  \n The analysis of the present paper proceeds as follows. In section 2 we present a brief \ndiscussion of the data on regional unemployment flows followed by an outline of the data on \nregional house prices and housing tenure patterns. Section 3 considers the theoretical linkages \nbetween housing market factors and regional unemployment flows, while section 4 discusses \nthe results of the empirical analysis. In section 5 we examine the implications for the \n                                                                                                                                                        \n1\n See Green and Hendershott (2001) for U.S. evidence on this issue. \n2\n  A number of papers have studied the determinants of spatial variations in outflows from unemployment at the \nsub-regional level (Bennet and Pinto, 1994; Coles and Smith, 1996; and Burgess and Profit, 2001), while \nArmstrong and Taylor (1985) present an analysis of spatial variations in the rate of inflows into unemployment in \nthe North West of England. \n 4\nrelationship between housing market factors and equilibrium regional unemployment \ndisparities. Finally, section 6 provides some concluding comments.  \nIn brief, the results of the paper indicate that both the level of regional house prices and \nthe housing tenure mix have a significant influence on the rate of flows into and out of \nregional unemployment and hence upon the equilibrium rate of unemployment in a region. In \nparticular, we find that, other things equal, the equilibrium rate of unemployment will tend to \nbe lower in regions with a relatively high level of regional house prices and\/or a low \nproportion of social rented housing. In contrast to Oswald (1996) we find that a high rate of \nhome ownership will tend to be associated with a low equilibrium rate of regional \nunemployment, other things equal.  \n \n \n2. Data Patterns and Trends  \n \n We analyse data on flows into and out of unemployment for the ten Standard Regions \nof Great Britain for the period 1984-95.3 The data are based on flows of individuals into and \nout of the official monthly count of those claiming unemployment benefit, and are therefore \nsubject to the same definitional changes and other discontinuities that afflicted the official \ncount of the stock of unemployed over this period.4 An additional complication is that the \nflow series relate to computerised claims only and therefore exclude a proportion of claimants \n- whose claims were processed clerically - who would have been included in the official \nfigures for the stock of unemployment. The flow series therefore under-record the actual \nnumber of individuals moving into and out of unemployment. It is known that most of this \nunder-recording occurred with respect to outflows, in that a significant number of the \n                                                 \n3\n The choice of period is restricted by considerations of data availability. 1984 is the first year for which a full \nyear\u2019s published data on regional unemployment flows is available. After 1995 the change to the regional \nclassification system in use in the UK, from Standard regions to Government Office regions, creates \ndiscontinuities in the published series for many of the explanatory variables used in the subsequent empirical \nanalysis.  \n 5\nunemployed who ceased to claim were not officially classified as outflows from \nunemployment. In order to minimise the potentially distortionary impact of this problem on \nour analysis, we follow the procedure adopted by Junankar and Price (1984) in their study of \naggregate unemployment flows and impute a series for outflows based on the series for \ninflows and regional unemployment stocks. \n Table 1 shows figures for the average rate of outflows from unemployment in each \nregion computed in this way for the period 1984-95, together with figures for the rate of \ninflows into unemployment and the average regional unemployment rate. Two measures of \nthe rate of outflows from unemployment are shown. The first is the rate of outflows from \nunemployment relative to the regional workforce, while the second is the rate of outflows \nrelative to the level of unemployment at the beginning of the year. The figures in Table 1 \nshow that there are considerable disparities in the rates of regional unemployment flows. For \ninstance, the average rate of inflows into unemployment in the North of England - the region \nwith the highest inflow rate - is 1.6 times that in the region with the lowest rate, the South \nEast. The rate of outflows from unemployment as a proportion of the workforce - which is \nstrongly correlated with the inflow rate  - exhibits a similar pattern of regional disparities. \nFinally, the average rate of outflows relative to the beginning of year level of unemployment \nranges from a high of 193.1% in East Anglia to a low of 142.9% in the West Midlands: a \nfactor of 1.4. 5 \n For comparison, Table 2 and Figure 1 provide information on regional housing market \ncharacteristics. Table 2 gives information on the pattern of housing tenure across regions, \nwhile Figure 1 shows figures for average regional house prices in 1984 and 1995.  \n                                                                                                                                                        \n4\n  These definitional changes and discontinuities are chronicled in the Appendix to Martin and Sunley (1997). \n5\n For a more detailed discussion of the data on regional unemployment flows in Great Britain, see Martin and \nSunley (1999). \n 6\n From the housing tenure figures, Scotland \u2013 in particular - and the North of England \nstand out as having relatively a low proportion of home ownership and a relatively large social \nrented sector (comprising local authority rented accommodation and accommodation rented \nthrough Housing Associations). By contrast, the South West has a relatively high proportion \nof owner-occupied housing and a relatively small social rented sector. The private rented \nsector is generally quite small and only in the southern-most regions \u2013 the South East, East \nAnglia and the South West \u2013 does it account for more than 10 percent of the dwelling stock. \n Figure 1 shows the familiar pattern of regional house price differentials, with house \nprices generally highest in the southern-most regions of Great Britain and lowest in the north. \nAlthough there are some relatively minor movements, the pattern of regional house price \ndifferentials is generally quite stable over time. For example, the correlation coefficient \nbetween the figures for the two years shown, 1984 and 1995, is + 0.94. \n The following sections of the paper investigate the extent to which the observed \nregional disparities in unemployment flows may be accounted for by these differences in \nregional housing market characteristics. \n   \n \n3. Housing Markets and Regional Unemployment Flows: Theoretical \nConsiderations  \n \n3.1 Inflows \n \n The analysis of inflows is based on a similar framework to that employed by Burgess \n(1992) to examine the determinants of the rate of inflows into unemployment at the aggregate \nlevel. The inflow rate into unemployment as a proportion of the beginning of period number \nof individuals in employment, i, equals the rate of quits into unemployment, qu, plus a second \ncomponent which is a function of the layoff rate, l; i.e.          \ni = qu + \u03c6(l)    \u03c6(l) \u2264  l \u2200 l     (1) \n 7\n \nThe function \u03c6 captures the notion that only a fraction of workers laid-off in region i may end \nup in unemployment. Some may migrate to take up employment in other regions, while others \nmay simply leave the workforce. The layoff rate itself is given by the planned rate of reduction \nin employment by firms experiencing negative shocks, npr, minus the expected rate of quits, \nqe; i.e. l = npr - qe \n The expected rate of quits provides an avenue through which housing market variables \nmay be expected to influence the inflow rate into unemployment. The avoidance of \ncommuting costs means that the process of moving between jobs often entails moving \naccommodation. The evidence for this is somewhat indirect, but Boheim and Taylor (1999) \nusing data from the British Household Panel Study report that amongst households who cite \n\u201cjob related reasons\u201d as reasons for moving house (around 14% of movers) over one third of \nmoves tend to be associated with quits.6 Significant transaction costs are typically incurred in \nthe process of buying a house - in the form of lawyers\u2019 and surveyors\u2019 fees, for example. In \naddition it is usual for buyers to be required to make an initial down payment of some \nproportion of the selling price. The process of moving house will therefore tend to be easier \nfor those high-value housing assets, who may be able to withdraw some of their housing \nequity in order to finance the costs of moving.7 This suggests that a positive relationship may \nbe expected between the quit rate and the level of regional house prices. Some empirical \nsupport for this may be found in the evidence produced by Henley (1998) who finds that, for \nmen at least, the probability that an individual quits his job is positively related to the rate of \nregional house price inflation. On this basis we might therefore expect to observe a negative \nrelationship between regional house prices and the rate of inflows into unemployment.  \n                                                 \n6\n This includes individuals moving between employers and those who leave to start their own business. See Table \n9 of Boheim and Taylor (1999). \n 8\nHousing tenure may also be expected to influence the willingness of workers to move \nbetween jobs. Homeowners - as well as house buyers - must typically incur costs in moving \nhome. An owner-occupier faced with the choice between staying in his or her current job and \nmoving to take up a job offer elsewhere must therefore include the costs of moving when \nweighing up the relative returns from the two options. For an individual in rented \naccommodation, however, the decision whether or not to move will be based solely on an \nassessment of the relative earnings from the two jobs. For any given level of the wage \ndifferential therefore, the probability of movement will be greater for a renter rather than an \nowner-occupier. 8 On this basis we might therefore expect to observe a negative relationship \nbetween the rate of owner-occupation in a region and the level of quits. Conversely, where no \nhouse move is required, the security conferred by the value of their housing assets may mean \nthat homeowners are more willing than renters to take on the risks associated with job \nmovement. The evidence on these issues is a little mixed. Boheim and Taylor (1999) show \nthat the probability that an individual changes his or her employment status in a given year is \nhighest for private renters and lowest for those who own their home outright (as distinct from \nmortgage holders), but this includes all labour market transitions rather than just job to job \nmoves. In contrast, in his econometric analysis Henley (1998) finds no evidence of a \nrelationship between an individual\u2019s housing tenure and the propensity to quit.  \nThe other variables that we expect to influence the quit rate are the proportion of \nyoung workers in the workforce, yth, the beginning of period rate of unemployment, and the \nvacancy rate. The rate of unemployment (vacancies) is expected to have a negative (positive) \neffect on the expected rate of quits and hence, a positive (negative) effect on the rate of \ninflows into unemployment. The effect of yth on the inflow rate into unemployment is \n                                                                                                                                                        \n7\n The influence of down payment requirements on house prices and housing market dynamics is studied by Stein \n(1995). \n 9\nambiguous a priori, as the negative effect that is expected to work through this channel may be \noffset by a positive direct effect on qu. \n \n3.2 Outflows  \nThe framework for the analysis of regional unemployment outflows is that used by \nRobson (2001), which is itself a variant of the \u2018job competition\u2019 framework employed by \nBurgess (1993) and more recently by Broersma (1997) to study the determinants of the rate of \noutflows from unemployment at the aggregate level.9 We hypothesise that relative to the \nregional labour force, the rate of outflows from unemployment in region i at time t (i.e. xit) is \ngiven by: \n \nxit = \u03bbit(h\/j)ituit          (2) \n \nwhere hit denotes the rate of new hires, uit denotes the rate of unemployment, and jit denotes \nthe number of individuals seeking jobs in the region - each again defined relative to the \nregional labour force. Finally, \u03bbit measures the relative success of the unemployed in attracting \njob offers. This final term captures the notion that the unemployed must typically compete \nwith other job seekers in the market for new hires in a region. These may comprise job movers \namongst the region\u2019s employed workforce, as well as migrants from outside the region. The \nnumber of those competing with the unemployed in the market for jobs will not be constant \nbut instead may be expected to vary with the state of the labour market. In particular, the \nintensity of on-the-job search amongst workers in employment may be expected to increase \nwith increases in the rate of new hires in the region. \n                                                                                                                                                        \n8\n This issue and its implications are examined further in Oswald (1997) and Haavio and Kauppi (2001). \n9\n A similar approach is also used by Anderson and Burgess (2000), in their analysis of outflows from \nunemployment at the state-level in the USA. \n 10\n What is the potential role for housing market factors within this framework? First, we \nnote that there is a potential demand-side effect, though this may be of relatively minor \nsignificance. A high level of regional house prices will tend to raise the wealth of owner-\noccupiers and lead inter alia to relatively high levels of expenditure on locally produced non-\ntradable goods and services (Evans and McCormick, 1994).10 This in turn may be expected to \nlead to high levels of labour demand in the regional economy, which we would expect to be \nreflected in a relatively high regional rate of new hires, hit. In the empirical analysis, we take \nthis hiring rate as given and focus our attention on the influence of the housing market on the \nsupply side of the labour market.  \nEquation (2) suggests two supply-side channels through which housing market \nvariables may be expected to impact on the rate of outflows from unemployment. The first is \nby influencing the number of competitors to the unemployed in the market for new hires. For \nexample, as noted above, housing tenure may be expected to influence the willingness of \nemployed workers to move jobs. In addition, the housing tenure mix of a region may affect the \nattractiveness of the region to in-migrants (Jackman and Savouri, 1992, present some \nevidence on this). Evidence certainly suggests a role for regional house prices in this context. \nFor example, Jackman and Savouri (1992) find that a high level of regional house prices is a \nsignificant deterrent to regional in-migration.  \nThe second supply-side channel through which housing market factors may impact \nupon the rate of outflows from unemployment is by influencing the competitiveness of the \nunemployed in the market for jobs (i.e. by influencing the value of \u03bbit). The success of the \nunemployed in capturing a share of new hires in a region may be dependent on their \n                                                 \n10\n In support of this, Carruth and Henley (1993) find a significantly positive effect of housing wealth on consumer \nspending in a number of UK regions. Furthermore, Maclennan and Tu (1998) find that during the period 1989-93 \nindividuals who perceived that falling house prices had reduced the value of their wealth were more likely than \nothers to have reduced their expenditure on consumption of non-necessities, including locally produced non-\ntradables such as entertainment and eating out.   \n 11\nwillingness to move within the region to look for work or take up the offer of a job. The \nextent of such intra-regional mobility is likely to depend on the characteristics of the regional \nhousing market. In addition to this, it is likely that regional house price differentials may \nreflect more general regional differentials in the cost of living. With unemployment benefit \nscales determined at the national level, regional house price differentials may therefore be \nassociated with inter-regional variations in the incentives for unemployed workers to search \nintensively for jobs. Higher levels of job search intensity may enable the unemployed in \nregions with relatively high house prices to capture a greater proportion of new hires.  \n \n4. Empirical Analysis \n \n We investigate the relationship between regional housing market characteristics and \nregional unemployment flows by estimating a series of pooled regressions on annual data for \nthe rate of flows into and out of unemployment in the 10 Standard Regions of Great Britain \nfor the years 1984-95.11  \n \n4.1 Inflows \n In the analysis of the rate of inflows into unemployment, we model npr as a function \nof regional average earnings and the growth of regional per capita GDP, plus a set of variables \nreflecting the industry composition of regional GDP and the occupational and skill \ncomposition of regional employment. The variables included are the proportion of \nemployment in manufacturing, the proportion of professional and managerial employees, and \nthe percentage of the regional workforce with a degree or equivalent qualification. Finally, we \ntreat \u03c6 as a function of the proportion of females in regional employment, and the regional rate \nof out-migration. Because women tend to have a lower attachment to the labour force than \n                                                 \n11\n The relatively short time-series dimension of the data precludes the use of panel integration tests such as those \nof Im et al (1997) to test for the presence of unit roots in the data.  \n 12\nmen, we expect a high proportion of females in the workforce to be associated with a \nrelatively low value of \u03c6 and hence a relatively low rate of inflows into unemployment, other \nthings equal. A high rate of out-migration should also tend to reduce the rate of inflows into \nunemployment within the region.  \nWe estimate an initial equation that includes current and lagged values of the \nexplanatory variables as well as a lagged dependent variable to allow for adjustment of the \ninflow rate to changes in the values of its determinants. Time dummies are included to capture \nthe effect of aggregate influences on the rates of quits and layoffs. Finally, we include a set of \nregion dummies to capture any otherwise unspecified persistent regional disparities in the rate \nof inflows into unemployment.  Estimation is by Instrumental Variables (IV) in order to allow \nfor the potential endogeneity of the current level of regional house prices and the rate of out-\nmigration. Column (1) of Table 3 shows the results that emerge following the deletion of a \nnumber of insignificant terms. Anderson-Hsiao estimates of this equation are presented in \ncolumn (2) in recognition of the biases that may be introduced by the presence of the lagged \ndependent variable (Nickell, 1981).12  \nThere are some discrepancies between the two sets of results but on the whole the \nsigns of the coefficients are broadly in line with expectations. The effect found for the \nproportion of professional and managerial employees is clearly an exception, however, and the \npositive short-run effect from the rate of out-migration is not easily explained.13 The results \nlend some support to Burgess\u2019s findings based on aggregate data, that a high beginning of \nperiod unemployment rate tends to raise the rate of inflows into unemployment, while a high \n                                                 \n12\n  The biases are predicted to be of order 1\/T, where T is the number of time periods used in the regression \nanalysis, and may be expected to affect the estimate of the coefficients for ln uit, as well as that for the lagged \ndependent variable. Each of these variables is therefore instrumented in the regression reported in column (2). \nNote that the first-differencing required in the implementation of the Anderson-Hsiao procedure reduces the \nnumber of available observations for this regression to 110. \n 13\nvacancy rate tends to reduce it (Burgess, 1992). The explanation for this is that a relatively \nhigh ratio of unemployment to vacancies discourages quits, so that a higher proportion of the \neffects of negative shocks to employment has to be absorbed by layoffs. The results suggest, \nhowever, that at the regional level these effects may be confined to the short-run.  \n Turning to the housing market variables that are the main concern of the paper, the \nresults in column (1) show a statistically significant negative effect of regional house prices on \nunemployment inflows. The effect is less well determined in the estimates reported in column \n(2) but is of a similar order of magnitude. In contrast, the estimates in column (1) suggest that \nregional variations in the pattern of housing tenure have no statistically significant impact on \nthe rate of inflows into unemployment. In column (2), however, the coefficient for the \nproportion of owner-occupation is on the borderline of significance. The negative coefficient \nsuggests that a higher rate of home-ownership is associated with a lower rate of inflows into \nunemployment, other things equal. \nA natural concern with these results is that the coefficient for regional house prices \nmay simply be picking up the effects of regional variations in the level of aggregate demand. \nHowever, the inclusion of terms in the rate of growth of regional per capita GDP in these \nequations makes this unlikely. Instead, the finding that the rate of inflows into unemployment \nis negatively related to the level of regional house prices is consistent with the arguments \nadvanced in the previous section concerning the role of house prices in facilitating housing \nand job mobility. A high level of regional house prices encourages a relatively high rate of \nvoluntary job separations and means that firms are less likely to have to resort to involuntary \nlayoffs in the event of a negative shock to regional employment.  \n                                                                                                                                                        \n13\n The most likely explanation for these \u2018perverse\u2019 results is that the variables are picking up the effects of a \nrelevant explanatory variable that has inadvertently been omitted from the regressions. In particular, they may be \npicking up the effects of unmeasured heterogeneity in the regional workforce. \n 14\n4.1 Outflows \nThe specification of the regression equation for the rate of outflows is based on the set \nof explanatory variables identified in Robson (2001) as potential influences on the rate of \noutflows from regional unemployment, supplemented with the regional house price and \nhousing tenure variables discussed previously. \n Within the context of equation (2), the key explanatory variables for the rate of \noutflows from unemployment in a region are the rate of new hires in the region and the \n(beginning of period) unemployment rate. As a proxy for the former we use figures for the \noutflow of vacancies notified to job-centres within the region. The rate of regional \nunemployment may be expected to influence the rate of outflows from unemployment both \ndirectly and indirectly - the latter due to its effect in reducing the number of employed workers \nengaging in on-the-job search. \n As noted above, the number of workers competing for new hires within a region will \ninclude a number of in-migrants from outside. In contrast, we need also to take account of the \nfact that a proportion of the region\u2019s workforce will migrate from the region to take up jobs \nelsewhere. In keeping with Robson (2001), we model these effects by including the rate of in-\nmigration and out-migration directly in our equation for unemployment outflows - making due \nallowance for the possibility that these variables may themselves be dependent on the outflow \nrate. \n Following the discussion of theoretical issues in section 3, the effect of regional house \nprices and housing tenure patterns may be expected to operate through the final term in \nequation (2), \u03bbit, which measures the relative success of the unemployed in the market for new \nhires. In addition, Robson (2001) suggests that this may depend, inter alia, on the following \nvariables: the proportion of the unemployed aged under 25 (u25); the proportion of older \nworkers amongst the unemployed (older); the proportion of long-term unemployed in the \n 15\nunemployment stock (ltu); the number of inflows into unemployment relative to the beginning \nof period stock of unemployment (infl); the variance of unemployment rates between the \nconstituent counties of the region (varu); the level of average earnings (w); and finally, the \nrate of new business formation, proxied by the rate of new registrations for VAT (vat). \nBriefly, the explanation for the inclusion of these variables is as follows. Firstly, young \nunemployed workers may be expected to be relatively active searchers in the market for jobs \nand relatively effective in competition with employed job seekers. For older unemployed \nworkers, however, the converse is likely to be true. In the case of the long-term unemployed, \nthere are a number of factors that may limit their effectiveness as competitors in the market \nfor new hires, including a low intensity of job search activity and the possibility that \nemployers may use unemployment duration as a screening device to sort applicants for \nvacancies (Blanchard and Diamond, 1994). The very short-term unemployed \u2013 i.e. the those in \nthe current inflow \u2013 will tend not to experience these disadvantages and in addition may enjoy \nthe benefit of being able to select from a bigger pool of job vacancies (Coles, 1994; Coles and \nSmith, 1995; Gregg and Petrongolo, 1997). A high rate of inflows relative to the beginning of \nperiod stock of unemployment may therefore be expected to have a positive effect on the rate \nof outflows.  \nThe variance of within-region county unemployment rates is included in an attempt to \ncapture the effects of intra-regional spatial mismatch between unemployment and vacancies. \nTo the extent that a greater variance of county unemployment rates is associated with greater \nintra-regional mismatch, a negative relationship between varu and \u03bbit may be expected.14 \nHigher levels of regional average earnings raise the returns from working relative to those \nfrom remaining unemployed and so may be expected to raise the competitiveness of the \n                                                 \n14\n Whether a higher value of varu is indeed associated with greater mismatch depends on the distribution of \nvacancies within a region. Unfortunately, we do not have data on county-level vacancy rates for this study.  \n 16\nunemployed in the market for new hires. Finally, jobs created by newly established firms may \nbe relatively unattractive to those already in employment (e.g. because the relatively high \nfailure rate of new firms means that the expected duration of such jobs will tend to be \nrelatively short) and hence a larger share of these jobs may be captured by unemployed job \nseekers. As such, a positive relationship between the regional rate of new business formation \nand \u03bbit may be expected.  \nIn addition to the above, the rate of in-migration and out-migration may have an effect \non \u03bbit by changing the composition of the region\u2019s unemployed. In general, one might \nreasonably expect that it will be the most active searchers in the job market who are most \nlikely to migrate between regions. A high rate of in-migration into the region\u2019s unemployment \nstock will therefore tend to raise the value of \u03bbit, while a high rate of out-migration is likely to \nreduce it. Finally, as in the analysis of inflows, we include time dummies and regional fixed \neffects in our estimating equations. The time dummies capture the effect of aggregate \ninfluences on the incentives for individuals to engage in on-the-job search and on the intensity \nof job search amongst unemployed workers. The regional fixed effects capture \u2018permanent\u2019 \nfeatures of regions that may influence the relative success of the region\u2019s unemployed in the \nmarket for new hires, such as for example, the density of the regional job-centre network.15 \nFollowing the deletion of a number of insignificant terms, we arrive at the \nspecification shown in column (1) of Table 4. Setting aside the housing market variables for a \nmoment, the results for the other variables are broadly in line with those reported in Robson \n(2001). The main difference is that in this study we find no role for a lagged dependent \nvariable in the equation.16 Turning to the housing market variables, the results again show a \n                                                 \n15\n  Robson (2001) also includes a measure of the effects of the Restart programme but this is found to be \nstatistically insignificant and is therefore omitted from the present study.  \n16\n We use the Anderson-Hsiao method to estimate an equation with the lagged dependent variable included but \nthe coefficient of this variable is found to be statistically insignificant (t = 1.20). Given the highly autoregressive \n 17\nstatistically significant effect from the level of regional house prices. The positive coefficient \nis consistent with the theoretical arguments discussed in the previous section and suggests that \nother things equal a higher level of regional house prices leads to a higher rate of outflows \nfrom regional unemployment. The results for the housing tenure variables suggest that other \nthings equal, the rate of outflows from unemployment is higher in regions characterised by a \nrelatively high rate of private sector renting. In contrast, the coefficient for the proportion of \nowner-occupation is only on the margins of statistical significance but in fact one cannot \nreject the null hypothesis that the coefficients for owner-occupation and private sector renting \nare the same (\u03c72(1) = 0.004).  \nColumn (2) of Table 4 reports estimates that result when this restriction is imposed \ntogether with a second restriction suggested by the estimates in column (1); namely that the \ncoefficient for ln uit is equal to unity. The dependent variable in this equation is therefore the \nrate of outflows from unemployment relative to the beginning of period unemployment stock. \nThe results suggest that as far as the effect of housing tenure is concerned the important \ndistinction is that between the private sector (owner-occupation plus private renting) and the \nsocial rented sector. In particular, it appears that other things equal, the rate of outflows from \nunemployment is lowest in regions characterised by a large social rented sector. Following the \ndiscussion in the previous section, the most plausible explanation for this finding is that it \nreflects a low rate of labour mobility amongst local authority tenants.17 \n As with the analysis of inflows, there is a natural concern that the effects that we have \nattributed to housing market factors, in particular those attributed to house prices, may simply \n                                                                                                                                                        \nnature of movements in the unemployment stock, the exclusion of this variable may be seen as somewhat \nsurprising. The presence of a lagged dependent variable in the inflows equation, however, suggests that \nmovements in the inflow rate may be the source of persistence in the unemployment stock. See Burgess and \nTuron (2000) for further evidence on this issue using aggregate data.  \n17\n The findings are consistent with microeconometric evidence reported by Boheim and Taylor (2000). They find \nthat amongst unemployed men, the exit rate from unemployment into full-time work is lowest for individuals who \nwere local authority tenants at the time of the start of their unemployment spell. \n 18\nreflect the effect of regional differences in the level of aggregate demand. In the regressions \nreported in Table 4, we would expect any such demand effects to be captured by the terms in \nthe rate of new hires. However, to try to further dispel the notion that the housing market \nvariables are simply picking up the effects of regional variations in the level of aggregate \ndemand, we re-ran the regression reported in column (1) of Table 4 with terms in the current \nand one-period lagged growth in regional per capita GDP included. The results did not reject \nthe hypothesis that these variables can be excluded from the equation (\u03c72(2) = 1.77).18   \n \n5. Housing Markets and Regional Unemployment Disparities \n \n The results from the previous section can help us to gain an insight into the processes \nthrough which housing market factors may have contributed to regional unemployment \ndisparities in Great Britain. Let iit denote the rate of inflows into unemployment in region i, \nand fit the rate of outflows relative to the unemployment stock. Then in equilibrium with the \nlevel of inflows into unemployment equal to the level of outflows we have (dropping the i and \nt subscripts for convenience): \nln i + ln N = ln f + ln U         (3) \nwhere N denotes the level of employment and U is the level of unemployment. Rearranging \n(3) we obtain  \nln (U\/N) = ln i \u2013 ln f          (4) \ni.e. in equilibrium, the natural logarithm of the ratio of unemployment to employment is equal \nto the difference between the natural logarithms of the inflow rate and the outflow rate. Note \nthat the latter may be written as:  \n                                                 \n18\n An additional concern is that the housing market variables may be capturing the effects of regional differences \nin the skill level of the workforce. However, for this to be a plausible explanation we would require a tendency \nfor the skill levels of unemployed workers relative to those of the employed workforce to be higher in areas \ncharacterised by high regional house prices and\/or a low rate of social renting. A priori there seems little reason \nto believe that this is likely to be the case.  \n 19\nln i \u2013 ln f = (1 - \u03b1)\u03b21Z1 - \u03b1 ln N + \u03b1 ln U - \u03b22Z2      (5) \nwhere Z1 denotes the determinants of the inflow rate and \u03b21 the associated parameter vector, \u03b1 \nis the coefficient for the level of inflows relative to the beginning of period stock of \nunemployment in the outflows equation, and \u03b22Z2 captures the effect on the outflow rate of all \nother variables apart from the level of inflows. Substituting (5) in (4) we therefore obtain: \nln (U\/N) = \u03b21Z1 - (\u03b22Z2\/(1 - \u03b1))        (6)          \nEquation (6), in tandem with the results from Table 3 and Table 4, may be used to \ngauge the effects of housing market factors on equilibrium regional unemployment. Consider \nfirst the effect of regional differences in the housing tenure mix. From the results in tables 3 \nand 4, we see that a region with a relatively high rate of owner-occupation and a relatively low \nrate of social renting (call this region A) will tend to have both a lower rate of inflows into and \na higher rate of outflows from unemployment, other things equal, than a region with the \nconverse housing tenure mix (region B). The net effect therefore, is that other things equal, \nregion A will have a lower equilibrium unemployment rate than region B. Using the estimates \nfrom column (2) of Table 3 together with those from column (2) of Table 4, gives a long-run \nelasticity with respect to the proportion of owner-occupied housing of \u20130.86. In other words, a \n10 percent difference in the proportion of owner-occupied housing between regions (relative \nto the proportion of social rented dwellings)19 is associated in the long-run with an 8.6 percent \ndifference in the ratio of unemployment to employment.  \nSimilar effects are observed for house prices. A higher level of regional house prices \nleads to a lower rate of inflows into unemployment and a higher rate of outflows. The \nestimated long-run elasticity of the ratio of regional unemployment to employment with \nrespect to regional house prices is \u20130.52. This direct supply-side effect on regional \nunemployment differentials will be reinforced if a higher level of regional house prices leads - \n 20\nperhaps via an increase in demand for locally produced non-traded goods and services - to a \nhigher rate of new hires in the region. The latter will tend to raise the rate of outflows from \nregional unemployment and thus further reduce the equilibrium unemployment rate relative to \nthat in a region in which house prices are lower.20  \n \n6. Conclusions \n \n By studying the effect of housing market variables on the flows into and out of \nregional unemployment, we have gained an insight into the contribution of the housing market \nto regional unemployment disparities in Great Britain. Both the price of owner-occupied \nhousing and the regional housing tenure mix are found to significantly influence the rate of \nflows into and out of regional unemployment. In the case of house prices, the combined effect \non the two flow rates implies that, other things equal, the equilibrium rate of unemployment \nwill tend to be lower in regions with a relatively high level of regional house prices.21 The \nresults of the paper therefore provide support for the view that regional house price \ndifferentials are a significant source of regional unemployment disparities. However, in \ncontrast to previous studies in which the transmission mechanism from regional house price \ndifferentials to regional unemployment disparities is seen to operate through the effects of \nhouse price differentials on inter-regional migration flows, the present analysis has identified \nmore direct effects that operate through the flows into and out of regional unemployment. \nThese effects are independent of the rate of inter-regional migration.  \n                                                                                                                                                        \n19\n i.e. a difference of approximately 6 percentage points, based on the figures reported in Table 2. \n20\n Additional effects of both regional house prices and housing tenure mix may operate in the short-run through \nthe terms in the rate of growth of regional in- and out-migration that appear in the inflow and outflow rate \nequations. However, we assume that in equilibrium these terms are equal to zero. For evidence on the effects of \nhouse prices on regional migration flows see Jackman and Savouri (1992), Cameron and Muellbauer (1998) and \nGordon and Molho (1998). These studies also include evidence on housing tenure effects, as do inter alia \nHughes and McCormick (1987), Pissarides and Wadsworth (1989) and Boheim and Taylor (1999). \n 21\nIn the case of housing tenure, the evidence of the paper is at odds with the argument \nput forward by Oswald (1996): that high rates of home-ownership will tend to lead to a higher \nequilibrium rate of unemployment.22 Instead, the results are supportive of an earlier literature \n(e.g. Hughes and McCormick, 1981; Minford et al., 1988) that emphasises the role of the \nsocial rented sector in creating impediments to labour mobility and thus leading to higher \nlevels of unemployment. \nIt is important to emphasise that in the equations we have estimated the housing \nmarket variables do not seem simply to be proxying for the effects of regional differentials in \nthe level of demand for goods and services. In the analysis of unemployment inflows we \nwould expect such effects to be captured by the inclusion of terms in the rate of growth of \nregional per capita GDP. In the case of outflows, the rate of new hires may be expected to \nperform a similar role, though in addition we have tested for the inclusion of terms in the rate \nof growth of regional per capita GDP and found these to be insignificant. Instead, the \nsuggested interpretation of the housing market effects that we have identified is that \u2013 \nprimarily - they reflect supply-side pressures on (intra-regional) labour mobility and the \ncompetitiveness of unemployed job seekers in the market for new hires.   \n The results of the paper help us to understand the role of housing market factors in \nhelping to lead to the unexpected compression of regional unemployment disparities in the \nrecession of the early 1990s. The sharp downturn in the housing market in the South East of \nEngland, which resulted in a decline in regional house prices of over 7%, contributed to a \nsteep rise in the rate of inflows into unemployment in the region by making it more difficult \n                                                                                                                                                        \n21\n This contrasts with the results from a recent paper by Cameron and Muellbauer (2001), which finds that high \nrelative regional house prices lead in the long-run to a higher relative regional unemployment rate, other things \nequal.   \n22\n Interestingly, the results of the present paper are not inconsistent with the empirical evidence presented by \nOswald for the case of the UK regions. In contrast to the analysis presented elsewhere in Oswald\u2019s paper, in the \ncase of the UK regions he reports of the results of regressions of the unemployment rate on the proportion of \n 22\nfor firms to reduce their employment levels without recourse to layoffs. The rate of outflows \nfrom unemployment will also have been reduced. The net effect therefore was a steep rise in \nthe regional rate of unemployment. In contrast, in the more traditional high unemployment \nregions such as the North and Scotland, the disturbance to the housing market, and hence the \neffect on the flows into and out of unemployment, was much less severe. \n From a policy perspective it is worth noting that the analysis highlights an interesting \nside effect of the \u2018Right-to-Buy\u2019 policy implemented by the Conservative government of the \nUK during the 1980s and 1990s. The analysis suggests that by encouraging local authority \ntenants to buy their homes and thus reducing the size of the social rented housing sector, the \npolicy is likely to have contributed to a significant reduction in regional unemployment \ndisparities.23 \nIn closing, we should note that this study neither seeks nor claims to represent the last \nword on the issue of the relationship between housing markets and the spatial distribution of \nunemployment. The ending of the data sample in 1995 is potentially a limitation of the \nempirical analysis. While in the period up to 1999 the UK experienced only relatively modest \nincreases in house prices, data from the more recent housing market boom may provide a \nmore stringent test of the stability of the relationships examined in this paper. The estimates \nshould therefore be treated with an appropriate degree of caution. Further work on the \ninfluence of housing market variables on the pattern of unemployment inflows and outflows, \nperhaps using more spatially disaggregated units of analysis, would be both feasible and \ndesirable. \n                                                                                                                                                        \nprivate renting, rather than the rate of home ownership. As in the present paper, regional unemployment rates are \nfound to be negatively related to the rate of private renting.  \n23\n Set against this, however, is the possibility that former council house homes bought by sitting tenants may be \nmuch less easy to re-sell. I am grateful to a referee for this point. \n 23\nTable 1.

The denominator is the civilian workforce.  \n \nShare of Young Workers in Employment (%) \nWe calculate this as follows. Firstly, we calculate the number of workers aged 16-24 using \nfigures on the civilian workforce and the percentage of the civilian workforce aged 16-24, \npublished in Regional Trends. Figures for total unemployment and u25 are then used to \ncalculate the number of unemployed workers aged under 25. By subtracting this number from \nthe civilian workforce aged 16-24, we obtain an estimate of the level of employment among \nthis age group, which finally we divide by total civilian employment to obtain the employment \nshare. \n \nThe Proportion of the Economically Active of Working Age with a Degree or Equivalent \nSource: Regional Trends, various issues. \n \nVariance of County Unemployment Rates \nVariance of the January unemployment rates (%) in the constituent counties of each region. \nSource: author\u2019s calculations based on data published in various issues of EG. \n \nNew Registrations for VAT Relative to the Civilian Workforce \nFigures for the annual number of new registrations for VAT in each region were obtained \nfrom Business Briefing, 23\/10\/92 and various issues of Regional Trends. \n  \nInflows of New Vacancies Relative to the Civilian Workforce \nThe vacancy flows series is obtained from NOMIS.\n 32\nReferences \n \nAnderson, P.M. and S.M.
