L. Leathard* and D. G. Dewhurst**\n* Department of Health Studies and Human Science, St. Martin's College, Lancaster\n** Faculty of Health and Social Care, Leeds Metropolitan University\nComputer-based simulations of undergraduate experiments in pharmacology and physiology may\noffer a cost-effective alternative to the traditional live laboratory for some students, for whom\nlaboratory skills are less important. Here we describe a study which compares two approaches to\nteaching preclinical medical students the pharmacology of colonic motility. Half of one cohort\nreceived a tutored live demonstration of an isolated tissue laboratory, while the other half used a\ncomputer simulation program covering the same subject. The study demonstrated that student\nlearning was comparable for both groups, that many students found the computer simulation an\nacceptable alternative and that the latter required significantly less resource.\nIntroduction\nThe computer-assisted learning program Intestinal Motility was produced to help\npreclinical medical students to understand the variety of ways in which drugs or\nendogenous mediators can alter intestinal muscle movements and thereby influence\npropulsion of luminal contents. It simulates experiments actually carried out on a rat\ncolon preparation, but the principles apply equally well to the small intestine and to the\nstomach and oesophagus of rat or other species. It can be used alone as a learning aid or\ncan be used to support practical class teaching.\nThe program consists of four discrete sections: Introduction, Method, Demonstration\nand Experiments, and the accompanying work booklet includes a set of student\nassignment questions together with model answers for tutors. Introduction contains a\ndescription of the objectives of the program, followed by an illustrated guide (a\ncombination of text and colour graphics) to the general structure and innervation of the\nintestines. Methods uses a similar combination of text and graphics to describe the\npreparation itself, the experimental set-up and the apparatus used. Demonstration uses\n118\nALT-} Volume 3 Number I\nanimated graphics to show a physiological peristaltic response elicited by a brief,\nsuprathreshold increase in intraluminal pressure and responses to intraluminal injections\nof test agents such as acetylcholine and adrenaline. This section is intended to give a\nvisual impression of how the colon is seen to behave when the experiment is performed\nlive. The main part of the program, Experiments, allows investigation of the direct effects\nof, and alterations in, the reflex response caused by a range of substances when applied\neither alone or in combination e.g. saline (control), neostigmine, atropine, acetylcholine,\ncarbachol, phenolphthalein, adrenaline. The program has been demonstrated to the\nBritish Pharmacological Society (Dewhurst et al, 1992)\nHere we present data from a study designed to determine the usefulness of the computer\nprogram (CAL) as a stand-alone method evaluated by comparison with the conventional\nteaching method - a tutored demonstration (DEM)) using students for whom the\nprogram was originally designed, i.e. second-year preclinical students at the Charing\nCross and Westminster Medical School in London. A brief account of part of the\nevaluation has also been presented to the British Pharmacological Society, but published\nonly as an abstract (Leathard et al, 1994).\nMethod\nThe 1992-93 practical class 'circus' cohort of 156 students were randomized to one often\ngroups, five DEM and five CAL groups (n = 14-16), for their intestinal motility practical.\nEach group received a common introduction in which the purpose and procedures of the\nevaluation were explained. Students were requested not to confer with members of the\nother group before handing in their work (on the fourth day after each class was held).\nThey were assured that although their answers would be scored for the purpose of the\nevaluation, the scores would not contribute to their course-work mark (which would be\ndetermined separately), and that tutorial support, if needed, would be available prior to\nthe practical course assessment. The completed assignments which were handed in by the\nappropriate deadline were photocopied. The originals were corrected and returned to the\nstudents. The unmarked copies were retained and scored for the evaluation exercise. Five\nof the twenty questions answered by the students were scored (Table 1). These were\nselected to test the following: students' extant knowledge; their understanding of the\ntissue preparation used; their data-interpretation ability; and the extent of their progress\nthrough a common sequence of tests.\nBoth the DEM and CAL groups each had a tutor present throughout the 90-minute class,\nand tutors were randomized to take DEM and CAL classes on equal numbers of different\noccasions so that their individual characteristics should not influence the outcome of the\nevaluation. Students in both groups were advised to work through the various tests in the\nsequence given in the practical schedules that were provided, but the CAL group were not\nconstrained to use this sequence.\nThis study compares:\n\u2022 the resources used for the two teaching methods;\n119\nH. L Leathard and D. G. Dewhurst Comparison of the cost-effectiveness of a computer assisted learning program\nTable I: Comparison of the learning scores of students from the two groups \u00a1n the study.\nThe DEM group (n = 52) received a tutored demonstration of a live laboratory practical and the CAL\ngroup (n = 53) received a computer simulation which allowed them to access typical results from a\nnumber of experiments performed on this preparation. Student learning was assessed using an\nassignment comprising twenty questions which were selected to test the following: students' extant\nknowledge; their understanding of the tissue preparation used; their data interpretation ability; and the\nextent of their progress through a common sequence of tests. For this study five of the questions\nanswered by the students were scored. Learning scores are expressed as the percentage of students\ngiving satisfactory answers to the questions.\nQuestion\nQI Explain the response elicited by the control injection of saline.\nQ7 The cone, of acetylcholine injected into the lumen to stimulate\nlongitudinal muscle in this preparation is 10,000 times the\nconcentration required in a conventional organ bath.\nWhat are the possible explanations?\nQ11 Explain the mechanism of action of neostigmine and suggest whether\ncholinesterases in this preparation will remain inhibited for (a) minutes,\n(b) hours, or (c) days.\nQ14 Explain the recorded flow pattern (in the presence of phenolphthalein)\nin terms of circular muscle activity.\nQ20 Suggest ways in which the atropine-resistant component of the stimulant\neffect of phenolphthalein could be mediated.\nDEM\n95\n70\n86\n63\n34\nCAL\n98\n50\n72\n51\n19\nMean\n97\n61\n78\n56\n26\n\u2022 the students' learning;\n\u2022 the attitudes of students from both groups to pertinent aspects of computer-assisted\nlearning.\nThe attitude assessment was based on a slightly modified version of the questionnaire\nused previously by Dewhurst et al. (1994). The first three questions sought information\nabout the students, access to and familiarity with computers. Twenty-five statements\nabout pertinent aspects of computer-assisted learning were then given, and students were\nasked to indicate their level of agreement\/disagreement with each statement using a five-\npoint Likert scale (strongly agree; agree; undecided; disagree; strongly disagree). A final\nopen question invited any further comments the student might wish to make.\nResults\nI Student learning\nOne hundred and twelve students submitted their answers by the stringent deadlines set\nfor the evaluation. Of these, fifty-two were from the CAL group and fifty-three from the\nDEM group, with seven failing to indicate the group they had belonged to. Their learning\n120\nALT-J Volume 3 Number I\nscores are shown in Table 1. While virtually all students gave satisfactory answers to the\nfirst question, subsequent questions were progressively less well answered, and the DEM\nstudents performed slightly better than the CAL students in each case. There was no\nstatistically significant difference in the mean scores of the two groups.\n2 Resources\nAs detailed in Table 2, the human resources used for the DEM students totalled fifty-six\nhours of technician's time and twenty-four hours of tutor's time. Equivalent figures for\nthe CAL students were four hours and fifteen hours respectively. Conservatively, these\nhours could be costed at \u00a310 per hour, in which case the staff costs for the DEM groups\nwould be \u00a3800, and for the CAL groups \u00a3190. The costs of materials were \u00a3130 for the\nCAL groups and \u00a360 for the DEM groups. It should be noted that the CAL costs are a\nTable 2: Comparison of the resources (staff and materials\/consumables) required for the two groups in\nthe study.\nThe DEM group were taught using a tutored demonstration of the live experiment in the laboratory,\nwhile the CAL group used a computer simulation of the experiment Staff resources are measured in\nhours of staff time while materials are costed in \u00a3 Sterling.

Apparatus for both\nteaching methods was available from stock and has not been considered.\n3 Student attitudes\nOne hundred students returned the Attitudes questionnaire, of whom 40 belonged to the\nCAL group, 48 to the DEM group; 12 did not indicate to which group they had belonged.\nOf these, 26 owned a computer, 82 stated that they had access to a computer, and 69 had\nsome (albeit limited) previous experience of using a computer program as an alternative\nto performing a practical using live tissue (questions 1-3 on the questionnaire). In general,\nthe views of students from each group were similar, so the main part of this analysis is\nbased on the responses of all the 100 students, points where there was some divergence\nbeing addressed afterwards. In the following summary, where responses are grouped, the\nnumber of students giving a particular response is indicated in parentheses after the\nresponse. Very small numbers of students responded 'strongly' to any of the statements.\nMore than two-thirds of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that 'Computer\nsimulations enable the student to control the pace of learning' (93), 'Computer simulation\nprograms allow acquisition of accurate results in the allocated time' (85) and 'Students\nwho need laboratory skills for their future careers can only obtain these skills by\nperforming practical experiments on live tissues' (75); and similar proportions disagreed\nor strongly disagreed that 'There is no place for computer simulations of laboratory\npractic\u00e1is in undergraduate bioscience degree courses' (91), 'Computers are difficult to\nuse, and should be avoided when possible' (86), 'AH undergraduate experiments using live\ntissues should stop' (82), 'Computer simulations of practical experiments are of very\nlimited value in the teaching of practical physiology and pharmacology' (69) and\n'Practical laboratory work on live tissues is the only successful method of reinforcing the\ntheory of physiological principles' (68).\nBetween half and two-thirds of the students agreed or strongly agreed that 'An important\nbonus in laboratory practic\u00e1is is that teacher-student and student-student contact is\nencouraged and learning is thereby enhanced' (66), 'Undergraduate laboratory-based\npractic\u00e1is are more expensive to carry out than utilizing computer simulation programs'\n(54), 'Replacing laboratory-based experiments with computer simulations provides the\nlecturer with more time for lesson planning, marking work, etc' (52) and 'During\nlaboratory practical experiments, the time spent learning how to use equipment often\nleaves insufficient time to complete the experiment' (52). Similar proportions of students\ndisagreed or strongly disagreed that 'Students need to receive special training to use a\ncomputer simulation' (62), 'Students always get poor results from their laboratory\npractical experiments' (59), 'Computer simulations of laboratory experiments can lead to\nthe acquisition of laboratory skills' (56) 'The use of live tissue to demonstrate\nphysiological\/pharmacological principles poses no moral dilemma' (53) and 'Computer\nsimulations of such experiments are difficult to use' (51).\nBetween one-third and a half of the students agreed or strongly agreed that 'The use of\ncomputer simulations of practical experiments enables the lecturer to spend more time\n122\nVolume 3 Number I\nwith the students' (48), 'Hands-on experience with live tissues is essential for all students\nof medicine' (45), 'There is a place for computer simulations only if they are used as a\nsupplement to demonstrations so that the real experiment can be seen first' (45) and\n'Computer simulations of experiments on live tissues can replace laboratory practical\nexperiments as they meet the majority of course objectives (45). Similar proportions of\nstudents disagreed or strongly disagreed that 'Computer simulations of practical\nexperiments are less instructive than laboratory-based practic\u00e1is' (49), 'Computer\nsimulation programs cannot adequately replace laboratory-based practical experiments in\nthe teaching of physiological and pharmacological principals' (46), 'Computer-based\nteaching is boring, thus limiting student learning' (45), 'Computer simulations convey\nlittle sense of the \"real\" experiment, therefore all appreciation is lost' (40), 'Hands-on\nexperience with live tissues is essential for all students of medicine' (34) and 'During\npractical experiments the time spent learning how to use equipment often leaves\ninsufficient time to complete the experiment' (34). The highest proportions of'undecided'\nresponses were elicited by the statements that 'Undergraduate laboratory-based practic\u00e1is\nare more expensive to carry out than utilizing computer simulation programs' (40),\n'Replacing laboratory-based experiments with computer simulations provides the lecturer\nwith more time for lesson planning, marking work, etc' (37) and 'Computer simulations\nof such experiments are difficult to use' (34).\nThere were some substantial differences in the proportions of responses to a few of the\nstatements by students from the CAL and DEM groups. In the following summary the\nproportions are given as percentages of the forty CAL students and forty-eight DEM\nstudents for ease of comparison. Whereas 65% of the DEM group felt that use of\ncomputer simulations freed lecturers' time, only 43% of the CAL group expressed this\nview. Forty percent of the CAL group but 17% of the DEM group concurred with the\nstatement about computer simulations being less instructive than the real thing, whereas\n15% and 38% respectively were undecided. Also, 45% and 65% respectively of CAL and\nDEM groups agreed that laboratory experiments are more expensive than computer\nsimulations, but 50% and 29% respectively were undecided.\nDiscussion\nMany of the results of this evaluation are unequivocal and need no further comment. The\ncomputer simulation class required significantly less staff resource (hours of technicians'\nand tutors' time) than did the live demonstration, and can therefore be considered to be\nless expensive since other costs were comparable.\nThe overall cost-effectiveness depends not only on actual costs but also on the adequacy\nof student learning. In this respect the CAL group performed less well than the DEM\ngroup although this varied from question to question. Question 1 was based on a\nfundamental concept that was explained carefully, and related to the first of the common\nsequence of tests. It is entirely appropriate that almost all the students gave a satisfactory\nanswer. In contrast, question 20 was based on the last section of the sequence of tests and\ninvolved concepts that were relatively novel to the students. Consequently, the numbers\n123\nH. L Leathard and D. G. Dewhurst Comparison of the cost-effectiveness of a computer assisted learning program\ngiving satisfactory explanations were low. Most of those in the CAL group reached this\nstage within the time allocated, whereas the demonstration of the live practical did not\nregularly progress this far. To compensate for the incomplete experiment, however, the\ntutor explained the final parts with the aid of a sample tracing from a preVious experiment\n(all students were provided with these). Thus, it seems that the tutors' explanations and\nthe integral discussion enhanced the students' understanding of the challenging parts.\nFrom students' comments and tutors' observations, however, it is evident that CAL\nstudents needed an opportunity for discussion with a tutor after completing the program,\nnot while they were concentrating on the screen; so tutors' time was not used optimally\nfor this teaching method during the evaluation.\nThe students' attitudes were generally favourable to computer simulations of experiments\nbut, from the responses to the open question and the views summarized above, it seems\nthat the majority would like to have some experience of the live practical with computer\nsimulations to support this.\nClearly in a financial climate where the unit of resource available for teaching and\nlearning is being reduced, teachers must consider carefully the costs of certain teaching\nstyles relative to the learning objectives. In this study it might be argued that, for medical\nstudents, a live demonstration is unnecessary since it is the knowledge and understanding\nof the pharmacology of colonie motility which is the important learning objective rather\nthan the laboratory skills associated with the investigation. In this study student learning,\nas measured by answers to key questions, is comparable for both groups, while the cost of\nthe live laboratory is significantly higher. The findings of this study are similar to those of\nsimilar studies where computer-based learning methods have been compared to\ntraditional live laboratories in undergraduate physiology and anatomy (Dewhurst et al,\n1994; Coleman et al, 1994; Guy & Frisby, 1992; Fawver et al, 1990).\nAcknowledgement\nWe wish to thank Professor Julia Buckingham and her staff in the Department of\nPharmacology at the Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School in London for their\nsupport of and contributions to this evaluation.\nReferences\nColeman, I., Dewhurst, D.G., Meehan, A.S. & Williams, A.D.
