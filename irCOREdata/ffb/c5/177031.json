Because trials (espe-\ncially large trials) can involve a substantial commitment\nof time and money, it is essential that they address impor-\ntant questions and use rigorous scientific methods. More\nrecently, however, it has been recognised that good man-\nagement and effective marketing are also essential to ena-\nble sufficient numbers of participating centres and\npatients to be recruited so that the study has enough sta-\ntistical power [1]. This paper reports a case study of a\nnovel application of a marketing approach from the world\nof business to a single clinical trial in order to develop a\nreference model for use in other trials.\nPublished: 20 November 2007\nTrials 2007, 8:37 doi:10.1186\/1745-6215-8-37\nReceived: 30 July 2007\nAccepted: 20 November 2007\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/8\/1\/37\n\u00a9 2007 Francis et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2007, 8:37 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/8\/1\/37Orientating concepts\nBusinesses strive to find customers and encourage them to\nbuy what is on offer. Clinical trials strive to find doctors\nand patients and encourage them to sign up. Thus they\nface similar challenges and may need to adopt similar\napproaches to achieve their goals.\nClinical trials progress through distinctive stages, includ-\ning study design, obtaining funding, finding participants,\ncollecting and processing data, interpreting the results,\nand reporting. In some stages of a trial the key require-\nment is to do good science. However, in others the chal-\nlenge is quite different \u2013 the key requirement is to install\nand operate a range of effective management techniques,\nsimilar to those required for marketing a product. Indeed,\nan experienced trialist observed that a trial is one fifth\nstructure (science) and four-fifths process (i.e. manage-\nment).\nMarketing \u2013 the process of finding, winning over and\nretaining customers \u2013 is an important topic in manage-\nment studies. Marketing has distinctive frameworks,\nmethods and techniques \u2013 generally drawn from sociol-\nogy and social psychology. Marketing became better\nunderstood in the 1960s [2] and now the discipline is\nubiquitous within larger companies and many not-for-\nprofit organisations. A definition of marketing by McDon-\nald and Wilson [3] describes it as \"a process for defining\nmarkets, quantifying the needs of the customer groups\n(segments) within these markets, determining the value\npropositions to meet these needs, communicating these\nvalue propositions to all those people in the organisation\nresponsible for delivering them and getting their buy-in to\ntheir role, playing an appropriate part in delivering these\nvalue propositions to the chosen market segments (and)\nmonitoring the value actually delivered\" (pp11). (A value\nproposition can be defined as a clear statement of the tan-\ngible results a customer gets from using the products or\nservices).\nThe marketing dimension is included only tangentially in\nthe literature on clinical trials [1]. For example, trials are\ngenerally stated to need recruitment strategies, use of\nmedia and data tracking systems. However, the notion of\na developing and working to achieve a formal marketing\nplan that covers all of the areas in the McDonald and Wil-\nson definition is generally absent from descriptions of\ntrial management.\nThis is not to suggest that trial managers consider the topic\nof marketing their trials to potential recruits lightly.\nIndeed, it is a dominant concern for many trialists. For\nexample, the Diabetic Retinopathy Awareness Program\nstudy [4] undertook many initiatives to recruit volunteers\nand concluded, \"these experiences substantiate the need\nfor a comprehensive coordinated approach, using\nplanned sources, to achieve recruitment success\" (pp432).\nFarrell [5] has argued persuasively that it is lack of solu-\ntions to managerial issues that reduce the effectiveness of\ntrials, and Rowe [6] suggested that, \"to get patients into\ntrials more efficiently pharma companies must begin to\nthink like marketers\".\nIt can be argued that marketing is especially important in\nclinical trials. Participation in a trial is a formal voluntary\nact, in that participants need to abide by a set of rules.\nAccordingly, not only is it necessary for people to volun-\nteer, they also need to sign-up to behave in accordance\nwith a set procedure [7]. In short, participants in a trial (be\nthey clinicians or patients or their families) need to make\na commitment, and undertake additional work, often\nwithout direct financial benefit to themselves.\nFrom a marketing perspective, conducting a successful\ntrial can be seen as a process with five main stages (Figure\n1). The five stages follow McDonald and Wilson's defini-\ntion but elaborate it significantly. The purposes and con-\ntent of each stage is amplified in Table 1.\nClinical trials require strategy, management, marketing\nand sales. Undoubtedly they undertake the activities listed\nin the table 1 in some way. However, what happens if\nthose who define the strategy of a trial, establish its man-\nagement processes, devise its marketing plan and attempt\nto sell the benefits of participation try to improve their\npractice by explicitly engaging with the discipline of man-\nFive stages in marketing a trialigure 1\nFive stages in marketing a trial.\nSET-UP\nGaining Prestige \nand Building \nRobust Systems\nMARKET PLANNING\nSegmenting Markets \nand Devising The \nMarketing Story\nSIGNALING\nConveying The \nMessage and Enrolling \nPatrons and Sponsors\nLEARNING\nDeveloping Market \nKnowledge and \nRedirecting Strategy\nREINFORCING\nMaintaining and \nRenewing\nCommitmentPage 2 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2007, 8:37 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/8\/1\/37agement? The study described below provides some pre-\nliminary answers to this question.\nMethods\nThis study is a component of a three-part project \u2013 STEPS\n(Strategies for Trials Enrolment and Participation) [8].\nThe first part included a quantitative analysis of the asso-\nciation between different patterns of recruitment in trials\nand factors thought likely to influence this pattern, based\non an examination of Medical Research Council (MRC)\nand Health Technology Assessment (HTA) records [9].\nThis showed recruitment often fails to meet targets. The\nsecond part explored these issues further using qualitative\nanalysis of transcripts from semi-structured interviews\nwith key players in four trials considered by MRC\/HTA as\nexemplars [10], with a particular focus on the complexity\nof financial negotiations. Here we report the third part\nbased on an in-depth investigation of a single trial from a\nbusiness perspective to assess its marketing strategy, in\norder to develop a reference model to aid future trials.\nThe Corticosteroid Randomisation after Significant Head\ninjury (CRASH) trial [11] was a large scale RCT of the\neffect of corticosteroids compared to placebo in improv-\ning important health outcomes [12]. The trial aimed to\nrecruit 20,000 head injured patients from hospitals world-\nwide. As the trial participants were unconscious the mar-\nketing strategy needed to focus on staff at participating\nhospitals (and not on the patients).\nCRASH had a marketing challenge since it needed to\nengage the interest and collaboration of hundreds of peo-\nple internationally, including members of ethics commit-\ntees, surgeons, doctors, nurses and administrators. During\nthe recruitment phase, one of us (DLF), a marketing and\nstrategy specialist from the academic business sector, was\ninvited to examine the trial as if it were a business, to com-\nment on its marketing strategy and to help the trial team\nto understand and put in place a marketing plan over a\ntwo-year period. He was given access to all trial docu-\nments (apart from confidential investigators' personal\ndetails and patient data). He visited three participating\nhospitals in England, observed training sessions and inter-\nviewed or facilitated group discussions with doctors,\nnurses and ancillary staff. He also conducted 11 inter-\nviews, and held numerous meetings with members of the\ntrial management team.\nThe methodological approach used techniques drawn\nfrom adaptive theory [13], case analysis [14] and action\nresearch [13]. The researcher's interview notes were ana-\nlysed using a grounded theory framework [15] and the\nemerging model was compared with data from studies in\ncommercial enterprises. The N-Vivo qualitative analysis\nsoftware program was used to structure data initially but\nmanual analytic methods were used later as often the pur-\npose was to highlight what participating agents were not\nsaying \u2013 rather than what they were saying. A professor of\nmanagement (independent of the study team) checked\nthe interpretative framework against the raw data. Emerg-\ning results were presented to a peer group (the STEPS\nresearch team) and to the team members of the CRASH\ntrial. A one-day marketing workshop using an action\nresearch approach was held with the trial team to provide\nTable 1: Activities within the five stages in marketing a trial\nStage Marketing Purposes\nSet-Up 1.

Early in 2004 an additional\nfive-hour workshop was held with representatives from\nthree trials (one of which was the CRASH trial) to gain fur-\nther insight into the practical implications of the findings,\nproviding a further opportunity to validate the\nresearcher's theory building process.\nAs the approach reported in this paper was part of a strat-\negy to try to improve recruitment into the CRASH trial, the\nSTEPS investigators decided that separate ethics commit-\ntee approval would not be required for this process as the\nCRASH trial had already received approval from the North\nLondon MREC.\nResults\nWhen commercial companies sell a product they attempt\nto convince a potential customer that they will gain bene-\nfits directly from their purchase. In the CRASH the trial\nmanagers were seeking to gain a commitment to engage\nfrom clinical professionals who would make no material\ngain for themselves. Accordingly, the CRASH trial was sell-\ning an opportunity for clinical professionals to participate\nin improving future clinical practice \u2013 an activity that can\nbe seen as being akin to a charitable endeavour [7]. A chal-\nlenge for the CRASH trial was to promote the idea that if\na clinician signed up to the trial then medicine itself\nwould progress and the clinician would be fulfilling a pro-\nfessional obligation.\nA previously unexplored dimension of the marketing\nchallenge was found to be the difficulty of gaining an evi-\ndence-based understanding the reasons why participants\n(in this case hospitals) signed up and what motivated\nthem to fulfil a commitment that had no sanctions for\nnon-performance. An analysis of feedback from partici-\npating hospitals concluded that they opted in for a variety\nof reasons, including the perceived merits of the study, the\nstature of the sponsors and advocates, the status provided\nto participants through participation and the affordability\nof participation (i.e how much time and effort would be\nrequired).\nA tentative reference model was developed from the\nresearch date that facilitated an ongoing assessment of the\nsales and marketing capability of the trial.\nThe reference model\nThe reference model defines the capabilities required for\nsuccessful marketing and selling of a medical trial that\noffered a holistic ideal type that the trial could use to\ndefine excellence [17]. It has four domains and 12 compo-\nnents and is illustrated as a wheel diagram (Figure 2). The\ntwelve components are described below.\nIa) Developing brand values\nBrand values define what a brand is and what it is not \u2013\ni.e. its personality. A clinical trial can be seen as a brand.\nWithout explicit brand values it is impossible to commu-\nnicate a coherent and persuasive perception of a trial's\npromise \u2013 i.e. what the trial intends to deliver to medicine,\ndoctors, patients etc.\nIb) Gaining legitimacy and prestige\nTrials need legitimacy \u2013 they need to be positively tagged\nby association with prestigious individuals and institu-\ntions (so a hospital doctor may say, \"I know that this is an\nimportant trial because Professor X, who I know and\nrespect, is supporting it). Legitimacy and prestige provide\npersuasive credibility key to gaining access to decision-\nmakers who decide whether a trial should be supported\nand maintain engagement.\nIc) Signalling worthiness\nIt is vital to signal to likely participants that, \"this trial will\ncreate greater value than the costs (time, effort or money)\ninvolved\". Buy-in is more likely to occur when partici-\npants realise, and identify with, the potential benefits that\nwill be delivered by the success of the trial. Methods for\ndoing this include presentations at conferences, journal\npublications, advertising, public relations and training\nmaterials.\nReference modelFigure 2\nReference model.\nMAKING THE\nSALE\nBUILDING\nBRAND VALUES\nI\nIIIII\nIV\nIIc Adopting An\nExplicit Marketing\nPlan\nIVc\nFacilitating\nIncorporation\nInto Routines\nIIb Devising\nStrategies For\nOvercoming\nResistance\nIb Gaining\nLegitimacy \/\nPrestige\nIVb Providing\nFrequent Positive\nReinforcement\nIIa Providing\nSimple,\nComplete\nProcesses\nIa Developing\n'Brand Values'\nIIIb Delivering A\nMulti-Audience,\nMulti-Level\nMessage\nIIIc Achieving Buy-\nIn (in public)\nIVa Ensuring\nPositive\n'Moments of\nTruth'\nIc Signalling\nWorthiness\nMAINTAINING\nENGAGEMENT\nIIIa Engaging Active\nSponsors, Champions\nand Change Agents\nPRODUCT AND\nMARKET\nPLANNINGPage 4 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2007, 8:37 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/8\/1\/37IIa) Providing simple, complete processes\nTrials require participants to undertake work that is addi-\ntional to their normal duties. Providing simple, complete\nprocesses reduces the costs of participation and increases\nthe chances that involvement will be affordable.\nIIb) Devising strategies for overcoming resistance\nPotential participants frequently raise objections. Trials\nshould have standard and persuasive answers to these.\nHaving a persuasive answer for each objection increases\nthe probability of making a sale.\nIIc) Adopting an explicit marketing plan\nThe marketing of a trial is too important and too compli-\ncated to be done informally. A formal marketing plan is\nrequired that should include a definition of target market\nsegments (groups that need to buy in to the trial) and the\ntrial's unique selling points (USPs). It is to be expected\nthat the marketing plan will need to be revised frequently\n\u2013 probably every quarter. It can be useful to have separate\nplans for dealing with (1) The Uninformed (Inform and\npersuade with targeted stories), (2) The Unconvinced\n(Address concerns point-by-point \u2013 \"get to yes\"), (3) The\nLaggards (Enrol, cajole, facilitate and target), (4) The\nSteady Performers (Reward, renew, upgrade and recognise)\nand (5) The Stars (Honour, learn from, and nourish).\nIIIa) Engaging active sponsors, champions and change agents\nSelling a trial to prospective participants requires persua-\nsion. This requires enrolling sponsors (public advocates),\nchampions (activists) and change agents (facilitators).\nTrial managers need a network of supporters to spread the\nmessage. Persuasion is more likely to occur if the advocate\nis respected and known personally to the prospective par-\nticipant.\nIIIb) Delivering a multi-audience, multi-level message\nTrials need to convey sales messages through publicity,\npresentations, training materials, etc. These should be\ntuned to the distinctive needs of target groups \u2013 for exam-\nple, surgeons are likely to be persuaded by different mes-\nsages than administrators or nursing staff. Speaking in the\nlanguage of the person being targeted and addressing their\nparticular pattern of motivation is more likely to succeed\nthan a one size fits all approach.\nIIIc) Achieving buy-in (in public)\nPublic buy-in requires that intended participants\nannounce their commitment to join the trial in a setting\nwhere others hear them. This is important because when\nsomeone states, in public, that they are willing to under-\ntake an action, then they are more likely to abide by their\ncommitment than if they take a silent decision \u2013 that can\nbe forgotten easily.\nIVa) Ensuring positive moments of truth\nPeople evaluate organisations (including trial manage-\nment teams) on the basis of their experiences at moments\nof truth. For example, if a doctor has a technical question\nabout entering a patient into a trial she will gain a strong\nimpression of the trial management team's competence\nby the way that the query is handled. If trialists behave\nwell in a moment of truth then loyalty grows; if not, loy-\nalty diminishes.\nIVb) Providing frequent positive reinforcement\nPositive reinforcement for existing participants should be\nan important part of a trial's participant retention strategy.\nIt is more expensive to recruit new participants than to\nretain existing participants.\nIVc) Facilitating incorporation into routines\nActivities that become embedded as routines are more\nlikely to be done than one-offs. Trial procedures should be\nincorporated into the routines of units undertaking the\nwork.\nDiscussion\nWe found that the CRASH trial faced challenges in mar-\nketing and selling that were mission critical \u2013 i.e. if goals\nwere not achieved then the trial would fail. Farrell,\namongst others, has been arguing for a greater recognition\nof the role of management in the conduct of clinical trials\n[5]. The key strength of the study reported here is that, for\nthe first time in academic literature, it offers a reference\nmodel that provides a conceptual framework that can sup-\nport and guide trial managers in assessing their marketing\nstrengths and weaknesses [18]\nThe reference model described above should be seen as a\ntentative framework rather than a definitive template. It\nwas developed from a theory-building process from a sin-\ngle trial and is best considered as a set of provocative\nhypotheses \u2013 later they may be developed as provisional\naudit tools. It may be that the reference model could be\nused as a diagnostic tool to identify if, and at what points,\na trial is failing so that remedial interventions could be\nundertaken. An audit of the CRASH trial enabled compo-\nnents that were considered to be weaker than others to be\nidentified and initiatives undertaken to improve in these\nareas. Further research is needed in other trials to explore\nwhether the model is complete and correct and whether\nuseful audit tools can be developed.\nClinical trials are not only research activities- they are also\ntime-bound businesses that have two interdependent sets\nof processes \u2013 one clinical and the other managerial. In\nthe main, since trials are seen as clinical endeavours, they\nare dominated by clinical issues and led by people with\nclinical skills. This is essential for certain policies andPage 5 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2007, 8:37 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/8\/1\/37practices but this cultural bias can result in the managerial\naspects of trials being, relatively, neglected. If this is true,\neven if only in part, it means that the radical improvement\nof clinical trials could require different ways of defining\nthe challenges of running successful trials \u2013 in particular,\nto ensure that they are seen as management challenges\nthat can benefit from the informed use of selected man-\nagement processes and techniques.\nThese considerations suggest that looking within past tri-\nals for the answers to the problem of under-performing\ntrials is necessary but will not be sufficient. In order to\nimprove trials it will be necessary to look outside the\nworld of clinical practice, into the worlds of business strat-\negy, management, marketing and sales to gain a fuller\nunderstanding of what can be done to upgrade perform-\nance of clinical trials. This insight is not new. Donovan,\nMills et al [19] state that the, \"methodological literature\n(on trials) is almost exclusively statistical and epidemio-\nlogical, and very little of it is concerned with the conduct\nor the particular demands that trials put on trialists and\nparticipants\" (pp766).\nConclusion\nThis study could begin to change the ways that trial man-\nagers undertake their work. Also, it provides a different\nway to think about the skill sets and competencies needed\nby those who manage clinical trials. In essence, the mes-\nsage of this study is simple \u2013 even simplistic. It is that trials\nare both complex projects and businesses (they need to\nfind customers). The key implication for clinicians is that\ninsufficient attention to management issues and market-\ning or sales activities will degrade the performance of the\ntrial.\nThere are significant implications for policy makers and\nfunding bodies as well. If the tentative conclusions of this\nstudy are correct, then the funders will need to examine\nmore than the scientific case before sponsoring a trial.\nThey will need to see a marketing and sales plan, and be\nassured that all of the required elements of the business\nsystem will be developed. Since a successful trial requires\nboth good science and good management, both need to\nbe given their due weight.\nBut there are differences. Business is about profit. Medi-\ncine is driven by human values. It would be wrong to infer\nthat publicly funded trials need to be more like businesses\n\u2013 rather, we suggest, that trials may benefit from using\nbusiness concepts and business techniques.\nThis cross-disciplinary study was based on the premise\nthat something new would be gained if a researcher from\nthe world of business and management studied a clinical\ntrial from his disciplinary perspective and worked with tri-\nalists to devise a useful framework. Since innovation is fre-\nquently facilitated by a clash of disciplines, it may be\nsome of the insights needed to improve trial recruitment\nwill come from fields other than medicine.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nThe idea for STEPS was jointly conceived by the Principal\nInvestigator, MKC, with AMG, VAE, DE, JG, CS, IR, DF,\nAMM and RCK.
