At eight loci, diversity patterns were compared 27 \nbetween Scottish and continental European populations. At these loci, a similar level of 28 \ndiversity (\u03b8sil=~0.01) was found in Scottish vs. mainland European populations contrary 29 \nto expectations for recent colonisation, however less rapid decay of linkage 30 \ndisequilibrium was observed in the former (\u03c1=0.0086\u00b10.0009, \u03c1=0.0245\u00b10.0022 31 \nrespectively). Scottish populations also showed a deficit of rare nucleotide variants 32 \n(multilocus Tajima\u2019s D=0.316 vs. D=-0.379) and differed significantly from mainland 33 \npopulations in allelic frequency and\/or haplotype structure at several loci. Within 34 \nScotland, western populations showed slightly reduced nucleotide diversity (\u03c0tot=0.0068) 35 \ncompared to those from the south and east (0.0079 and 0.0083, respectively) and about 36 \nthree times higher recombination to diversity ratio (\u03c1 \/ \u03b8=0.71 versus 0.15 and 0.18, 37 \nrespectively). By comparison with results from coalescent simulations, the observed 38 \nallelic frequency spectrum in the western populations was compatible with a relatively 39 \nrecent bottleneck (0.00175 x 4Ne generations) that reduced the population to about 2% of 40 \nthe present size. However heterogeneity in the allelic frequency distribution among 41 \ngeographical regions in Scotland suggests that subsequent admixture of populations with 42 \ndifferent demographic histories may also have played a role. 43 \n44 \n 3 \nIntroduction 45 \nNucleotide polymorphism is influenced by several factors including mutation, migration, 46 \nselection and random genetic drift. In tree species, the current increase in sequence data 47 \ngathered from nuclear gene loci has been driven mostly by the search for the molecular 48 \nsignature of natural selection (Achaz, 2009; Neale and Ingvarsson, 2008; Savolainen and 49 \nPyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi, 2007). Selection can leave its traces as deviations from neutrality in the level 50 \nof nucleotide diversity, allele frequency distribution or correlation between polymorphic 51 \nsites (linkage disequilibrium) (Achaz, 2009). However, the capability to detect selection 52 \nat individual loci is heavily dependent on the assumptions of the neutral model (e.g. 53 \nconstant long term population size, random mating), the strength of, and time since, 54 \nselection and the number of loci involved (and their relative effect) in selectively-55 \ninfluenced traits (Wright and Gaut, 2005). Therefore, prior to testing for selection, 56 \ndatasets must be evaluated for violations of neutral model assumptions. Such processes, 57 \ne.g. historical changes in population size and distribution, may drive deviations from 58 \nneutrality that mimic the effect of selection. However, these effects are expected to be 59 \ngenome-wide and so can be distinguished from selective influences by simultaneous 60 \nassessment of data from multiple loci. Although the patterns of variation in the majority 61 \nof nuclear loci studied to date obey neutral expectations and the signature of selection has 62 \nbeen elusive (Savolainen and Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi, 2007) polymorphisms at nuclear loci provide 63 \nhighly valuable insights into evolutionary history (Heuertz et al, 2006; Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 64 \n2007). 65 \n 66 \n 4 \nAll northern European tree populations have experienced substantial historical changes in 67 \ndistribution. For example, palynological and phylogeographic data indicate that during 68 \nthe last glacial maximum (25-18 000 years ago (ya)), most species were confined to the 69 \nsouthern peninsulas (Iberia, Italy and the Balkans) and some parts of eastern and central 70 \nEurope (Cheddadi et al, 2006; Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2008; Willis and van Andel, 2004) and 71 \nonly reached their most northerly limits around 9000 ya. The recolonization history of 72 \nforest trees, accompanied by adaptation to local environments, has potentially influenced 73 \nthe pattern of nucleotide diversity both among locally adapted populations and between 74 \nrange edge populations and putative refugial populations. In theory, population 75 \nbottlenecks reduce nucleotide diversity in range-edge populations relative to that in 76 \nsource populations, although this is dependent on the timing and severity of the 77 \nbottleneck. In contrast, admixture of populations due, for example, to recolonization from 78 \ndifferent refugia, may increase diversity (Petiti et al. 2003). However, recent studies in 79 \ncontinental European populations of Scots pine (Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007) and Norway 80 \nspruce (Heuertz et al, 2006) found little evidence at the nucleotide level for the effects of 81 \nrecent (post-glacial) population size changes during migration and suggested bottlenecks 82 \nin the mid-to-late Pleistocene. In addition, similar to other predominantly outcrossing tree 83 \nspecies with highly efficient long distance gene flow via pollen (Hamrick et al, 1992), 84 \nneutral genetic differentiation between Scots pine populations is low. For instance, 85 \nmarginal population differentiation was reported for neutral markers between Finnish 86 \npopulations (Karhu et al, 1996), between Scandinavian and eastern parts of the range\n \n87 \n(Wang et al, 1991) and, at several candidate gene loci for growth\n \nphenology and cold 88 \ntolerance, among populations along a latitudinal\n \ncline in continental Europe (Dvornyk et 89 \n 5 \nal, 2002; Garc\u00eda-Gil et al, 2003). The large population sizes of forest trees and capability 90 \nfor maintenance of high levels of genetic variation within populations seems to further 91 \nbuffer against rapid changes in genetic diversity, but causes difficulties in detection of 92 \nrecent demographic processes. If the migrations following the most recent glaciations are 93 \nto have left any signature at all in contemporary populations of forest trees, it seems 94 \nlikely to be detectable only where populations have experienced severe bottlenecks or 95 \nbecame rapidly isolated.  96 \n 97 \nIn Scotland, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is at the extreme north-western edge of its 98 \nvast distribution, which reaches across Europe and Asia and is the largest of any pine 99 \nspecies (Critchfield and Little, 1965). Pines first colonized the land that became the 100 \nBritish Isles about 10 000 ya, at around the time that Ireland became isolated, and reached 101 \nnorthern Scotland by about 9000 years ago (Huntley and Birks, 1983; Svendsen et al, 102 \n1999). According to  fossil data in Scotland, pine first appeared in the Wester Ross region 103 \nin the northwest, and then shortly afterwards in the Cairngorms in the east (Birks, 1989). 104 \nThe subsequent formation of the English Channel (c.6000 ya) and competition from 105 \nbroadleaved species in southern Britain left Scottish pinewoods physically separated by at 106 \nleast 500 km from mainland populations in continental Europe. Nowadays, native 107 \npinewoods in Scotland cover about 18 000 hectares, in 84 differently-sized fragments 108 \npatchily distributed within a ~ 200 x 200 km area across significant environmental 109 \ngradients in altitude, soil type, growing season length and annual rainfall mainly in the 110 \neast-west direction (e.g. annual rainfall varies from 700 to 3000 mm across 160 km) 111 \n(Mason et al, 2004). Small-scale provenance experiments have shown genetic variation 112 \n 6 \nbetween Scottish populations from different locations, e.g. in root frost hardiness and 113 \ngrowth in seedlings (Perks and McKay, 1997) and differentiation among populations at 114 \nseveral quantitative traits (Perks and Ennos, 1999). There is reasonable evidence from 115 \npollen (Birks, 1989), allozymes, monoterpenes and mtDNA (Kinloch et al, 1986; Sinclair 116 \net al, 1998) suggesting a west\/east population subdivision within Scotland and that 117 \npopulations from these regions may have different origins (Ballantyne and Harris, 1994; 118 \nBennett, 1995). Given the iconic status of Scots pine in Scotland and the severe 119 \nfragmentation of the population, there is considerable interest in evaluating its population 120 \nhistory.  121 \n 122 \nIn this study, we focus on the Scottish Scots pine population as a unique and isolated 123 \noceanic fragment at the northwest extreme of the distribution to assess whether recent 124 \ndemographic processes have influenced patterns of nucleotide variation. We analysed 125 \npatterns of nucleotide diversity, allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium in a 126 \nmultilocus nuclear gene dataset in samples gathered from multiple locations within 127 \nputatively divergent regions within Scotland and compared our data to those from 128 \nsamples from northern and central Europe, Turkey and Spain. Using this data and 129 \ncoalescent simulation analysis, we aimed to assess whether Scottish populations show the 130 \nmolecular signature of demographic history and the extent to which they are 131 \ndifferentiated from those in continental Europe. 132 \n133 \n 7 \nMaterials and Methods 134 \nSampling and DNA extraction 135 \nSeed samples from 21 locations in Scotland were included in the study (Figure 1.). The 136 \ntrees were sampled across an environmental gradient related to differences in altitude, 137 \nlength of growing season, annual rainfall and average mean temperature in winter 138 \n(Supplementary Table S1). Cones were collected from mature trees in recognised old-growth 139 \nScots pine forest; at these sites trees are typically over 150 years old and often much older 140 \n(Steven and Carlisle, 1959). Trees were separated by at least 50 m to minimise sampling of 141 \nclosely related individuals. Sampling included the seven currently adopted seed zones of the 142 \nspecies in Scotland, from each of which 3 locations were sampled, 2 individuals per 143 \nlocation.  144 \nFor most of the between-population analyses the samples were grouped according 145 \nto climatic characteristics into three geographical locations \u2013 western, southern and 146 \neastern, represented by eighteen, twelve and twelve individuals, respectively (Figure 1, 147 \nSupplementary Table S1). The western group has the lowest mean altitude (~142m), the 148 \nlongest growing season (~ 240 days), highest mean temperature in winter (~ 2\n0\nC) and 149 \nhigh annual rainfall (~ 2000mm). The eastern group has the highest mean altitude 150 \n(~372m), the shortest growing season (~175 days), and is the coldest (-0.1\n0\nC) and driest 151 \n(~1050mm) part of the distribution, whilst southern group was intermediate between 152 \nthese extremes except for annual rainfall (~2130mm). Field trials have demonstrated 153 \ngenetic differences in phenology and growth rate among provenances originating within 154 \nthese groups  (Perks and Ennos, 1999).  155 \nGenomic DNA was extracted from haploid megagametophyte, maternal tissue 156 \nwhich surrounds the embryo in the seed. As DNA samples were haploid, the haplotypes 157 \n 8 \ncould be determined by direct sequencing. In total, 42 DNA extracts were prepared, 158 \nrepresenting two different trees from each location. Seeds were germinated for a few days 159 \nin moisturized petri dishes and then extracted following a standard CTAB 160 \n(cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) protocol with addition of PVP to 1% concentration 161 \nin the lysis buffer.  162 \n 163 \nLoci studied 164 \nIn total, sixteen nuclear loci were analysed. This included several dehydrin genes that 165 \nwere identified in expression studies in Scots pine (Joosen et al, 2006). Based on the 166 \nnumber and position of the conserved segments (Close 1997), we analysed the class SK4 167 \nof dehydrins (dhn1), SK2 (dhn2) and a group of K2 genes (dhn3 and dhn7). We analysed 168 \nalso SK type of dehydrin upregulated by water stress in Pinus taeda roots (Eveno et al, 169 \n2007) and a putative dehydrin (dhy-like) described for Scots pine (Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007). 170 \nOther loci described in more detail in original papers include abscissic acid responsive 171 \nprotein (abaR) (Wachowiak et al, 2009); early response to dehydration 3 protein (erd3), 172 \nabscissic acid, water dehydrative stress and ripening induced gene family members 1 and 173 \n3 (lp3-1, lp3-3), Caffeoyl CoA O-methyltransferase (ccoaomt), putative arabinogalactan\/ 174 \nproline-rich protein (PR-AGP4-1) and putative arabinogalactan\/ glycin-rich protein 175 \n(grp3) (Eveno et al, 2007); ABI3-interacting protein 2 (a3ip2), alcohol dehydrogenase C 176 \n(adhC) and chalcone synthase (chcs) (Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007).  177 \nIn previous work, ten loci (dhn1,2,3,7, dhy-like, dhy2PP, abaR, a3ip2, adhC, 178 \nchcs) were analysed in Scots pine from the continental European range including fifteen 179 \nsamples from Northern Europe (populations from Northern and Southern Finland and 180 \n 9 \nSweden), fifteen from Central Europe (Poland, Austria and France), and five from each 181 \nof Turkey and Spain (Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007; Wachowiak et al, 2009). The reference 182 \nsequences of eight loci in total (excluding dhy-like and adhC, see below) were compared 183 \nwith those from Scottish populations. The samples from the Iberian Peninsula and Turkey 184 \nwere treated separately in between-region comparisons as they display specific 185 \nmitochondrial types not observed in mainland European distribution of the species which 186 \nsuggests different histories and no contribution to recolonization after last glaciation 187 \n(Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2008; Soranzo et al, 2000).  188 \n 189 \nPCR amplification and sequencing 190 \nPCR-amplification was performed with PTC-200 (MJ Research) and carried out in a total 191 \nvolume of 25\u00b5l containing about 10ng of haploid template DNA, 50\u00b5M of each of dNTP, 192 \n0.2\u00b5M of each primer and 0.25U Taq DNA polymerase with the respective 1x PCR 193 \nbuffer (NovaZyme, Poland). PCR followed standard amplification procedures with 194 \nMgCl2 concentration optimised for each primer pair as described in Supplementary Table 195 \nS2. PCR fragments were purified using QIAquick\nTM\nPCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). 196 \nAbout 20 ng of PCR product was used as a template in 10 \u00b5l sequencing reactions with 197 \nthe Big Dye Terminator DNA Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) performed by the 198 \nGenePool sequencing service, University of Edinburgh. All samples were sequenced in 199 \nboth directions. CodonCode Aligner software was used for editing and assembling of the 200 \nsequence chromatograms to produce alignments based on nucleotide sequence from both 201 \nDNA strands. Haplotype sequences of each locus reported in this paper are deposited in 202 \nthe EMBL sequence database under accession numbers GQ262040 \u2013 GQ262490. 203 \n 10 \n 204 \nSequence analysis   205 \nHigh quality sequences were obtained for most of the samples at twelve loci (Table 1). 206 \nPCR amplification or sequencing failed in most of the samples at dhy-like, adhC and grp3 207 \nand these loci, together with PR-AGP4-1 which was monomorphic across all 42 samples, 208 \nwere excluded from further analysis. Nucleotide sequence alignments were constructed in 209 \nClustalX and were further manually adjusted using GenDoc. All sequence 210 \npolymorphisms were visually rechecked from chromatograms edited with BioEdit. 211 \nCoding and noncoding regions (introns, UTRs) were annotated based on the NCBI 212 \n(http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/) sequence information at each locus and web-based gene 213 \nidentification tool at PlantGDB (http:\/\/www.plantgdb.org\/cgibin\/PlantGDB\/GeneSeqer\/ 214 \nPlantGDBgs.cgi). The influence of demography on the multilocus pattern of variation and 215 \nlocus specific effects were assessed by looking at the amount of nucleotide diversity, 216 \ncorrelation between polymorphic sites and allelic frequency distribution between 217 \ndifferent geographical locations in Scotland and in comparison to mainland populations 218 \nof the species and by comparing observed statistics with simulated values under a range 219 \nof demographic scenarios. Neutrality tests at intraspecific level were applied to search for 220 \ndepartures from a neutral model of evolution. Sequences from Pinus pinaster were used 221 \nas an outgroup for intraspecific comparisons to test for a signal of longer term selection.  222 \n 223 \nNucleotide diversity  224 \nTwo measures of nucleotide diversity were applied: 1) an average number of nucleotide 225 \ndifferences per nucleotide site between two sequences , (Nei, 1987) calculated with 226 \n 11 \nDNAsp  4.0) and 2) Watterson\u2019s (1975) estimate of the population mutation parameter, 227 \ntheta (\u03b8W, equal to 4Ne\u03bc, where Ne is the effective population size and \u03bc is the mutation 228 \nrate per nucleotide site per generation), computed based on the number of segregating 229 \nsites and the length of each locus using MCMC simulation under a Bayesian model as 230 \npreviously described (Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007). The estimates of nucleotide diversity were 231 \nconducted for all samples combined and separately for south, east and west regional 232 \ngroups of Scottish populations. Scottish and continental European populations were 233 \ncompared at eight loci for which informative data was available (Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007; 234 \nWachowiak et al, 2009). Exceptionally high nucleotide diversity was found at lp3-3 locus 235 \ncompared to other loci in our dataset. Due to the size of the conifer genome and the 236 \noccurrence of multigene families (Ahuja and Neale, 2005), erroneous co-amplification of 237 \ndifferent loci from the same family is possible and may account for unusual diversity 238 \nestimates at specific loci. Therefore, locus lp3-3 was excluded from multilocus or average 239 \nestimates reported in the study to avoid bias and ensure that estimates were conservative; 240 \nthe locus was included in population structure analysis and coalescent simulations.  241 \n 242 \nLinkage disequilibrium and haplotype diversity 243 \nThe level of linkage disequilibrium was measured as the correlation coefficient r\n2  \n 244 \n(Hill and Robertson, 1968) using informative sites. Indels and sites with three nucleotide 245 \nvariants identified in dhn1 (3), dhy2PP (1) were excluded from the analysis. Under 246 \nmutation-drift-equilibrium model, the decay of linkage disequilibrium with physical 247 \ndistance was\n \nestimated using non-linear regression of r\n2 \nbetween polymorphic sites and 248 \nthe distance (in base pairs) between\n \nsites as detailed in (Wachowiak et al, 2009). The 249 \n 12 \nnon-linear least-squares estimate of \u03c1 (\u03c1 = 4Nec, where Ne is effective population size, c 250 \nis the recombination rate) between adjacent sites was fitted by the nls-function 251 \nimplemented in the R statistical package (http:\/\/www.r-project.org). The overall and 252 \ngroup specific least-squares estimates of \u03c1 were computed and compared to other 253 \nestimates in Scots pine (Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007; Wachowiak et al, 2009). 254 \nThe number of haplotypes and haplotype diversity (Hd) were estimated for each 255 \ngene using DNAsp. Insertions and deletions were included in all estimates. Coalescence 256 \nsimulations with locus specific or average \u03c1 for six loci and without recombination were 257 \nused to assess whether there are more or fewer haplotypes than expected and whether 258 \nhaplotype diversity is higher or lower than expected given the number of segregating 259 \nsites. The number of haplotypes and haplotype diversity were calculated for all samples 260 \ncombined and separately for the three regional groups of Scots pine in Scotland. 261 \n 262 \nNeutrality tests 263 \nDeviations of particular genes from the frequency distribution spectrum under the 264 \nstandard neutral model of evolution were assessed with Tajima\u2019s D test (Tajima 1989) 265 \nand Fay and Wu\u2019s H (Fay and Wu 2000). Negative values of Tajima\u2019s D indicate an 266 \nexcess of low frequency polymorphisms consistent with positive directional selection or 267 \nrecent population expansion, whereas positive values indicate an excess of intermediate 268 \nfrequency polymorphism potentially due to balancing selection or population contraction.  269 \nFay and Wu\u2019s H test measures departures from neutrality based on high-frequency 270 \nderived alleles. An excess of high frequency derived alleles compared to neutral 271 \nexpectations may result from recent positive selection or strong population structure with 272 \n 13 \nuneven sampling from populations. The distribution of test statistics was investigated for 273 \neach locus for all populations combined and separately for the three regional groups. 274 \nMultilocus estimates of Tajima\u2019s D were assessed with HKA software 275 \n(http:\/\/lifesci.rutgers.edu\/~heylab). The estimates were also calculated along the sequence 276 \nof each locus by a sliding window of 100 sites with successive displacement of 25 sites. 277 \nAs lack of recombination makes the D test overly conservative (Thornton 2005), the 278 \nsignificance of locus specific and multilocus Tajima\u2019s D was also evaluated by coalescent 279 \nsimulations dependent on population mutation and recombination rate (MANVa software 280 \nwww.ub.edu\/softevol\/manva, based on coalescent program ms, Hudson, 2002). Different 281 \nestimates of \u03c1 including locus specific estimates, lowest and highest value across loci and 282 \naverage value for six loci were used in coalescent simulations. As similar probability 283 \nvalues for multilocus D statistics were observed in simulations with different 284 \nrecombination rate estimates, the results based on the average values of \u03c1 at the analysed 285 \nloci are reported unless otherwise stated.   286 \nFor tests based on nucleotide variation between species we used reference 287 \nsequence data from P. pinaster for outgroup comparison. To assess the correlation 288 \nbetween the level of nucleotide polymorphism and divergence at each locus we applied 1) 289 \nthe McDonald and Kreitman, (1991) test, based on comparison of the pattern of within-290 \nspecies polymorphism and between-species divergence at synonymous and 291 \nnonsynonymous sites in a gene, and 2) HKA test (Hudson et al, 1987) which allows the 292 \ndetection of loci that demonstrate unusual patterns of polymorphism compared to 293 \ndivergence across genes. Comparison of multilocus polymorphism and divergence at all 294 \nsites was assessed using HKA software (http:\/\/lifesci.rutgers.edu\/ ~heylab). The ratio of 295 \n 14 \nnonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous site (Ks) nucleotide divergence from the outgroup 296 \nspecies (Hughes and Nei, 1988) was calculated using DnaSP.  297 \n 298 \nPopulation structure 299 \nTo check if there was a geographical difference in allelic frequency spectra, regional 300 \ngroups of Scottish populations were compared to each other and to previously analyzed 301 \ncontinental European populations from northern and central Europe, Spain and Turkey 302 \n(Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007; Wachowiak et al, 2009). Genetic differentiation between the 303 \nregions was studied locus by locus at both haplotype and SNP\/Indel level and also by 304 \naveraging pairwise FST over all polymorphic sites across loci. The significance of genetic 305 \ndifferentiation was evaluated by 1000 permutations of the samples between groups using 306 \nArlequin ver. 3.0 (Excoffier et al, 2005). Population structure from the haplotypic data 307 \nwas tested by Snn and KST\n* \nstatistics (Hudson et al, 1992; Lynch and Crease, 1990), which 308 \nare more appropriate for sequence-based haplotype data where diversity may be high and 309 \nsample size low, rendering frequency-based approaches problematic. Their significance 310 \nwas evaluated using 1000 permutations, where samples were randomly assigned into 311 \ndifferent groups (Hudson, 2000). Genetic clustering of the individuals based on both full 312 \nsequence data and all segregating sites and indels at 12 loci (for Scottish populations) and 313 \nat 8 loci (for Scottish and mainland European populations) was conducted using BAPS 314 \n5.2 (Corander and Tang, 2007). Polymorphic sites from each locus were treated as linked 315 \nmolecular data to account for dependence between segregating sites in the gene. 316 \nCompletely linked sites (r\n2\n=1) were excluded from the analysis.  317 \n 318 \nCoalescent simulations 319 \n 15 \nTo further infer the demographic history of Scottish Scots pine populations we compared 320 \nthe observed distribution of average Tajima\u2019s D and Fay and Wu\u2019s H at the candidate loci 321 \nseparately in the western, southern and eastern group and in all geographic regions 322 \ncombined to the simulated values under several demographic scenarios including the 323 \nstandard neutral model (constant population size), growth model and bottleneck model 324 \nfollowed by exponential growth (Supplementary Figure S4). Regional groups of 325 \npopulations were analysed separately as detailed aspects of the frequency spectrum may 326 \ndiffer between groups that are not differentiated based on genetic clustering methods 327 \n(Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al 2007). Coalescent simulations were run independently for each locus and 328 \nvarious demographic scenarios using the program ms (Hudson 2002) and the approach 329 \ndescribed by Haddrill et al (2005). In each case, 5000 replicates were simulated for each 330 \nlocus. The analyses were performed with recombination using the locus specific (when 331 \navailable) or average value of \u03c1 per site for the analysed loci in each geographic group 332 \n(Table 2, Supplementary Table S3). We tested various bottleneck scenarios of different 333 \nage and severity. The time from the end of the bottleneck (measured in units of 4N0 334 \ngenerations from the present) ranged from 0.0002 to 0.05 and bottleneck severities 335 \n(measured in units of the current\n \npopulation size) from 0.001 to 0.5. Assuming for 336 \ninstance, Ne of 200000 and generation time of 25 years, the time range corresponds to 337 \nbetween 4 000 and 1 million years and severity from 0.1 to 50% of the current population 338 \nsize. In most bottleneck models tested, the ancestral and current effective population sizes 339 \nwere assumed to be equal, bottleneck duration (f) was fixed to f=0.0015 (units of 4N0 340 \ngenerations from the present) and the growth rate of 10 was constant across simulations 341 \nas in previous studies (Heuertz et al. 2006). A subset of simulations were run also with 342 \n 16 \nf=0.006 and corresponding equal or doubled ancestral population size as compared to the 343 \ncurrent one, and also separately for a set of 11 and 9 loci (excluding lp3-3 and dhn1 and 344 \nabaR, respectively as the later showed some evidence of selection). A schematic 345 \nrepresentation of the simulated bottleneck model is shown in Supplementary Figure S4. 346 \nThe simulation results for each demographic scenario were summarized using the 347 \nprogram analyser HKA. The perl script multitest_pop1.pl was used to perform multilocus 348 \ntests of ms-generated genealogies (including P-values of the observed mean values of 349 \nTajima\u2019s D and Fay and Wu\u2019s H statistics) summarized using analyser HKA. The 350 \nprograms are available from http:\/\/genomics.princeton.edu\/ 351 \nAndolfattoLab\/Andolfatto_Lab.html. 352 \n 353 \nResults  354 \nNucleotide polymorphism and divergence 355 \nThe average total nucleotide diversity ( ) in Scottish populations at eleven loci was \u03c0tot = 356 \n0.0078 and at nonsynonymous sites was \u03c0ns = 0.0031 (Table 2). Slightly lower average 357 \nnucleotide diversity was found in the west (\u03c0tot = 0.0068) as compared to southern and 358 \neastern regional groups (\u03c0tot = 0.0079 and 0.0083, respectively) and similar values were 359 \nfound at nonsynonymous sites (\u03c0ns= ~ 0.003) (Supplementary Table S3). Multilocus 360 \nestimates of silent Watterson theta  was \u03b8sil=0.0095 (with 95% credibility intervals of 361 \n0.0074-0.0122) for all Scottish populations combined, \u03b8sil=0.0086 (0.0063-0.0117) in the 362 \nwest, \u03b8sil=0.0111 (0.0080-0.0152) in the south and \u03b8sil=0.0103 (0.0074-0.0143) in the 363 \neast. In comparisons between Scottish vs. mainland European populations at eight loci, 364 \nsimilar but slightly higher average values of total nucleotide diversity (\u03c0tot = 0.0070 vs 365 \n 17 \n0.0062) and silent multilocous theta (\u03b8sil=0.0108 vs. 0.0093) were found in Scottish 366 \npopulations (Table 3). 367 \n 368 \nLinkage\n \ndisequilibrium and haplotype polymorphisms 369 \nRapid decay of linkage\n \ndisequilibrium between pairs of parsimony informative sites at 370 \neleven loci was found in Scottish populations, with \u03c1 = 0.0085 \u00b1 0.0009 (Table 2) and 371 \nexpected r\n2 \nvalues of 0.2 at\n \na distance of about 400 bp. The decay of linkage\n \n372 \ndisequilibrium in the western group (\u03c1 = 0.0074 \u00b1 0.0008) was more rapid as compared to 373 \nthe south (0.0025 \u00b1 0.0004) and east (0.0024 \u00b10.0006) (Figure 2) and the pattern was 374 \nconstant at most loci (Supplementary Table S3). Overall, Scottish populations had about 375 \nthree times slower decay of linkage\n \ndisequilibrium as compared to mainland populations 376 \nat the same set of eight loci of similar sample size (\u03c1 = 0.0086 \u00b1 0.0009 vs  377 \n0.0245\u00b10.0022, respectively) (Supplementary Figure S1). However, the rate of decay of 378 \nLD and the relative level of recombination to diversity (\u03c1 \/ \u03b8 ratio) were similar between 379 \nwestern Scottish and north and central European regions (Table 3) but these parameters 380 \nwere over three times smaller in southern and eastern groups of Scotland.  381 \nThe average number of haplotypes per gene was 12 and haplotype diversity was very 382 \nhigh (Hd=0.789\u00b10.042). Similar haplotype diversity was found in western (Hd 383 \n=0.754\u00b10.077), southern (Hd=0.819\u00b10.088) and eastern (Hd=0.800\u00b10.090) groups 384 \n(Supplementary Table S3). Haplotype diversity was slightly higher than mainland 385 \nEuropean populations at the same set of eight loci (Hd=0.831\u00b10.038 vs Hd=0.795\u00b10.051) 386 \nand also compared to previous estimates for Scots pine (Hd=0.683\u00b10.059, Wachowiak et 387 \nal. 2009). Locus Lp3-3 contained two sets of haplotypes (each of 18 samples equally 388 \n 18 \ndistributed across three geographical groups) with highly reduced levels of nucleotide 389 \npolymorphism (\u03c0tot = 0.0090 and 0.0074, respectively) as compared to the whole gene 390 \nestimate (\u03c0tot = 0.0370) and a ten-fold difference in the level of divergence (Ksil1=0.013 vs 391 \nKsil2=0.116) (Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary Figure S2). A neutral 392 \ncoalescence process, compatible with a constant-size\n \nneutral model without 393 \nrecombination or erroneous coamplifications of different gene family members could 394 \npotentially generate such a pattern. However, no reading-frame shifts or premature stop 395 \ncodons, which would suggest the presence of non-functional alleles, were found at the 396 \nlocus.  397 \n 398 \nNeutrality tests 399 \nTendency towards an excess of old over recent mutations across genes was detected by 400 \nmultilocus Tajima's D at eleven loci in the total data set (D=0.118) (Table 2), in the 401 \nwestern (D=0.364), southern (D=0.103) and eastern (D=0.260) groups (Supplementary 402 \nTable S3). Significant excess of intermediate frequency mutations was found at dhn2 403 \n(D=1.968, P<0.05) and lp3-3 (D=2.846, P<0.01). Statistically significant positive values 404 \nof Tajima\u2019s D were identified in sliding window analyses in a few regions within dhn2 (D 405 \n= 2.36-2.48 at 307\u2013449 bp), a3ip2 (D = 2.22 at 401-501 bp) and lp3-3 (D = 2.13-3.18 at 406 \n51\u2013454 bp) loci. Overall, an excess of high-frequency derived variants indicated by 407 \nnegative mean values of Fay and Wu\u2019s H statistics was found in all Scottish populations 408 \n(H= -0.494) (Table 2), in the west (H= -0.447) and east (H= -0.145) groups, but slightly 409 \npositive values were found in the south (H= 0.144) (Supplementary Table S3). The 410 \naggregated Scottish populations show a deficit of rare variants (multilocus Tajima\u2019s 411 \n 19 \nD=0.316) as compared to mainland European populations (D=-0.379). Both geographical 412 \nregions show negative mean value of Fay and Wu\u2019s H statistics (H=-0.564 and -1.240, 413 \nrespectively) indicating an excess of high-frequency derived SNPs (Table 3).  414 \nAn excess of fixed nonsynonymous over fixed synonymous substitutions and 415 \npolymorphic sites was found at dhn1 locus in McDonald-Kreitman test (Fisher\u2019s exact 416 \ntest, P = 0.05), as previously found in European mainland populations (Wachowiak et al, 417 \n2009). An excess of nonsynonymous sites as compared to synonymous sites was found at 418 \nabaR (Supplementary Table S5). The level of divergence was similar across all sites and 419 \nat silent sites only (~4%), and was slightly lower than previous estimates for Scots pine 420 \n(K=~0.05, Wachowiak et al. 2009). Overall, positive correlation between polymorphism 421 \nand divergence (HKA test) was found at eleven loci combined.   422 \n 423 \nPopulation differentiation 424 \nDifferentiation between Scottish populations 425 \nSignificant differentiation measured as an average over all polymorphic sites was found 426 \nbetween southern and eastern groups at dhn1 (FST=0.034, P<0.05) and between southern 427 \nand eastern as compared to the western group at ccoaomt (FST=0.149, P<0.05 and FST 428 \n=0.102, P<0.01, respectively) and lp3-1 (FST =0.100, P<0.05 and FST =0.197, P<0.001, 429 \nrespectively) (Supplementary Table S6). A difference in frequency of indel 430 \npolymorphisms at dhn1, four silent substitutions and indel polymorphisms at lp3-1 and 431 \nabsence of four silent polymorphisms in the western group as compared to the others at 432 \nccoaomt locus contributed the most to the differentiation between groups. Based on 433 \nhaplotype differentiation, the western group differed from the southern group at a3ip 434 \n 20 \n(Snn=0.629, P<0.05), lp3-1 (Snn=0.758, P<0.01) and at ccoaomt and lp3-1 based on KST 435 \nstatistics (KST = 0.066 and 0.051, P<0.05, respectively). They also differ from the east 436 \ngroup at lp3-1 locus (KST=0.075, P<0.05). Significant FST statistics based on haplotype 437 \nfrequency were found for lp3-1 in the south and east as compared to western group 438 \n(P<0.05) and nearly significant values for ccoaomt between south and west groups 439 \n(P=0.06) (Supplementary Table S6). No difference between west-south, west-east and 440 \nsouth-east groups were found based on average FST over all polymorphic sites and indels 441 \ncombined across the loci (FST =-0.013, -0.013, and 0.01, respectively).  442 \n 443 \nDifferentiation between Scottish vs European continental populations 444 \nBased on allele frequency and\/or haplotype diversity statistics Scottish populations were 445 \ndifferentiated from continental European populations at six out of eight loci analysed 446 \n(Supplementary Table S7). Significant population differentiation (FST), measured both as 447 \nan average over polymorphic sites and at the haplotype level, was found at dhn2, dhn7, 448 \nabaR and chcs. Based on the average proportion of nearest-neighbor haplotypes that are 449 \npresent in the same locality (Snn) both groups were differentiated at dhn2, dhn7, dhy2PP 450 \nand a3iP (P<0.001-0.05). Two loci, dhn2 and dhn7, also showed high similarity between 451 \npairs of sequences derived from each region (KST = 0.098 and 0.067, respectively, 452 \nP<0.01).  453 \nSignificant differentiation was found between Scottish populations versus continental 454 \nEuropean populations measured as an average of FST values over all polymorphic sites 455 \ndetected (Table 4). The only exceptions include southern Scottish populations as 456 \n 21 \ncompared to northern and central Europe, eastern Scottish compared to northern 457 \nEuropean and western Scottish compared to Spanish populations.  458 \nAnalysis of genetic clustering with full sequence data gave the best support for all 459 \nindividuals from European mainland and Scottish populations at eight loci and for 460 \nindividuals from Scottish populations at 12 loci belonging to one genetic cluster. At all 461 \npolymorphic sites and indels at both eight and twelve loci, the best support was obtained 462 \nfor four clusters, but without clear pattern of geographical distribution (Supplementary 463 \nFigure S3).  464 \n 465 \nCoalescent simulations 466 \nFor each geographic group of Scottish Scots pine populations the observed pattern of the 467 \nfrequency distribution spectrum was not compatible with either the standard neutral or 468 \ngrowth models. In simulations under the SNM and growth model\n the mean Tajima\u2019s D 469 \nwas significantly lower and Fay and Wu\u2019s H significantly higher than the observed values 470 \nexcept for the southern group, the only one with positive mean H values (Table 5, 471 \nSupplementary Table S8). Among the 20 different bottleneck models tested the most 472 \ncompatible for the western group was a relatively recent bottleneck (t=0.00125) that 473 \nreduced the population to 2% of the present size followed\n \nby moderate population growth 474 \n(Table 5, Supplementary Table 9). This model also held for the eastern group but was 475 \nalways rejected for the southern group, where different bottleneck scenarios never lead to 476 \npositive values for both Tajima\u2019s D and Fay and Wu\u2019s H statistics (Supplementary Table 477 \n9). In general, the simulations indicate heterogeneity in the allelic frequency distribution 478 \namong geographic regions in Scotland.  479 \n 22 \nDiscussion 480 \nMultilocus signatures of population history 481 \nThe Scottish populations showed clear molecular signatures of different demographic 482 \nhistories. Across all regions, the allele frequency distribution was skewed towards 483 \nintermediate frequency polymorphisms, and the rate of decline of linkage disequilibrium 484 \nwas reduced and nucleotide diversity levels were equivalent to or higher than continental 485 \nEuropean populations of the species. The skew of allelic frequency distribution, apparent 486 \nas positive values of Tajima\u2019s D, was in clear contrast to previous reports for this species 487 \nin continental Europe (Palm\u00e9 et al, 2008; Wachowiak et al, 2009) and for published 488 \nstudies of other species (North American Douglas fir, Eckert et al, 2009; P. taeda 489 \nGonz\u00e1lez-Mart\u00ednez et al, 2006a; other conifer species Savolainen and Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi, 2007; 490 \nEuropean Quercus petraea Derory et al, 2009; Populus tremula Ingvarsson, 2005) where 491 \nnegative values of Tajima\u2019s D have been found. In these species, the excess of low 492 \nfrequency derived mutations has been ascribed to the influence of postglacial range 493 \nexpansion (Brown et al, 2004; Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007) or potentially the influence of 494 \nrecurrent selective sweeps (e.g. Eckert et al, 2009). In contrast, rather than range 495 \nexpansion, the bias towards intermediate-frequency polymorphisms in Scottish 496 \npopulations suggests the influence of a bottleneck although, as shown in recent 497 \nsimulation studies, a skew of allelic frequency variants may also result from pooling local 498 \nsamples with different demographic histories (St\u00e4dler et al, 2009). However, the 499 \nbottleneck hypothesis was also supported by the overall pattern of linkage disequilibrium 500 \n(LD), which showed a reduced rate of decline relative to continental European 501 \npopulations of the species. In coalescent simulations, the bottleneck scenario fits best for 502 \n 23 \nwestern populations and the data were compatible with a relatively recent, severe 503 \nbottleneck. Depending on the effective population size and generation time assumed, this 504 \nbottleneck ended a maximum of a few tens of thousands of years ago (e.g about 25 000 505 \nya assuming Ne=200 000). Bottlenecking is expected to increase association (correlation 506 \namong sites with distance) of alleles and polymorphic sites across loci.  In Scottish 507 \npopulations, the decay of LD was almost three times slower than that in mainland 508 \npopulations. Reduced decay  of LD has also been observed in populations of American P. 509 \ntaeda that had probably experienced bottlenecks (Brown et al, 2004; Gonz\u00e1lez-Mart\u00ednez 510 \net al, 2006a) and contrasting allele frequency distributions were observed between 511 \nnorthern populations and recently bottlenecked southern populations of Quercus crispula 512 \nin Japan (where the latter showed positive Tajima\u2019s D, Quang et al, 2008).  513 \n 514 \nAlthough there are exceptions (Grivet et al, 2009), it is expected that bottlenecks should 515 \nhave a stronger impact on the allele frequency distribution spectrum and LD than on the 516 \noverall level of diversity (Wright et al, 2005). Long-lived, wind-pollinated tree species 517 \nshould be capable of maintaining genetic diversity even during range shifts; i.e. they are 518 \nbuffered against rapid changes in genetic variation due to fluctuations in population size 519 \n(Austerlitz et al, 2000). Indeed, relative to mainland European populations of Scots pine, 520 \nScottish populations did not show a decline in nucleotide diversity, as is expected where 521 \ncolonisation has been relatively recent (Nei et al, 1975; Pannell and Dorken, 2006). In 522 \nfact, genetic variation in Scottish populations seems to be slightly higher than in 523 \nmainland populations (\u03b8sil=0.011 vs 0.009, respectively) and relative to previous 524 \nestimates for the species (\u03b8sil= 0.005 at 16 loci with some related to timing of bud set 525 \n 24 \n(Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007) and \u03b8sil=0.0089 at 14 cold tolerance candidate loci (Wachowiak et 526 \nal, 2009)). Compared to estimates in other forest tree species, overall diversity in Scottish 527 \npopulations ( tot=0.0078) is only lower than that in broadleaved Populus tremula (0.0111, 528 \nIngvarsson, 2005) and is higher than that in Q. crispula, (0.0069, Quang and Harada 529 \n2008), Q. petraea (0.0062, Derory et al. 2009), P. pinaster  (0.0055, Eveno et al. 2008), 530 \nP. taeda (0.0040, Brown et al, 2004), Picea abies (0.0039, Heuertz et al, 2007) and other 531 \nconifers (Savolainen and Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi, 2007). The diversity estimate for Scottish 532 \npopulations is compatible with the patterns of genetic variation observed in previous 533 \nstudies  (monoterpenes Forrest, 1980; Forrest, 1982), allozymes Kinloch et al, 1986), 534 \nchloroplast DNA microsatellite markers Provan et al, 1998).  535 \n 536 \nAlthough it seems clear that bottlenecking has been an influence on Scottish populations, 537 \nestimation of the timing of the event is heavily dependent on various assumptions 538 \nincluding the effective population size and generation time estimates. For instance, in 539 \ncontinental populations of Norway spruce and Scots pine, simulation studies suggested a 540 \nrather ancient bottleneck that ended several hundred thousand to more than one million 541 \nyears ago, respectively (Lascoux et al, 2008). In our data, coalescent simulation of 542 \nvarious demographic scenarios supported the conclusion that bottlenecking had occurred, 543 \nbut suggested more recent timing. A similar signal, suggesting bottlenecking on a 544 \ntimescale related to the most recent glaciation, was detected in Italian populations of 545 \nAleppo pine (Grivet et al, 2009). Furthermore, the severity of the bottleneck experienced 546 \nby Scottish populations appears to have been strong enough to account for the observed 547 \n 25 \ndiscrepancy in allelic frequency distributions and decay of LD, in contrast to continental 548 \nEuropean tree populations (Lascoux et al, 2008).  549 \n 550 \nHowever, as we observed heterogeneity in the pattern of nucleotide diversity among 551 \nregions within Scotland, it seems likely that different parts of the population have 552 \nexperienced different demographic histories.  The ratio of recombination to diversity and 553 \nthe level of linkage disequilibrium in western Scottish populations were similar to those 554 \nin mainland European populations but about three times higher than those in southern and 555 \neastern Scottish groups. Various bottleneck scenarios could be clearly rejected for the 556 \nsouthern group in our coalescent simulation analysis. The homogenizing effects of gene 557 \nflow on genetic diversity are well known for highly outcrossing wind pollinated species, 558 \nand there is evidence for historically high gene flow among Scottish populations from 559 \nwork using chloroplast markers (Provan et al, 1998). In addition, molecular and isozyme 560 \nstudies provide no suggestion of a difference in outcrossing rates between regions that 561 \ncould account for a difference in spatial distribution of polymorphism (Kinloch et al, 562 \n1986). As, until recently, Scots pine covered large parts of Scotland, differentiation 563 \nbetween regional groups due to genetic drift also seems unlikely, as this should be  most 564 \nsignificant for small populations (Pannell and Dorken, 2006). Inter-regional differences 565 \nalso seem unlikely to be the result of selection. If this was the case, we would expect 566 \ndifferences in the frequency distribution spectrum between groups or at least reduced 567 \ndiversity levels at selected loci. However, the observed dominance of intermediate 568 \nfrequency variants in all groups together with very rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium 569 \n(within a few hundred base pairs) excludes a selective sweep as an explanation. 570 \n 26 \nFurthermore, nucleotide and haplotype diversity is at least as high in southern and eastern 571 \ngroups as in the western group, whereas directional selection should reduce diversity. 572 \nTherefore, overall, historical changes in population size and distribution seem a more 573 \nplausible explanation for the pattern of nucleotide variation in Scottish populations and, 574 \nas a single migration and bottleneck event cannot account for the observed pattern of 575 \ndiversity, it seems that heterogeneity within the Scottish population is most likely to be 576 \nthe result of admixture of populations from different origins.  577 \n 578 \nCompared to continental Europe, southern and eastern groups of Scottish pines showed 579 \nno overall difference in allele frequency distribution at polymorphic sites from north or 580 \ncentral European populations, but differentiation from Spanish and Turkish populations. 581 \nOn the other hand, the western group was significantly differentiated from all mainland 582 \npopulations except those from Spain. In previous studies, populations from the west of 583 \nScotland were more closely related to southern European populations in monoterpene 584 \ncomposition and isozyme frequency (Forrest, 1982) or geographically structured mtDNA 585 \nvariation (Sinclair et al, 1998) than to populations from north-central Europe, which were 586 \nmore similar to the southern and eastern Scottish pinewoods. Similarities between 587 \nwestern Scotland and south European Scots pine could simply be stochastic, due to 588 \nhomogenising selection for similar environments or, alternatively, could reflect common 589 \nancestry of the populations. Genetic similarity at mtDNA markers (maternally transmitted 590 \nin pines) suggests the latter. However, as Iberian populations did not contribute to the 591 \nmost recent recolonization of central and northern Europe (Prus-Glowacki and Stephan, 592 \n1994; Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2008; Soranzo et al, 2000; Tobolski and Hanover, 1971), this 593 \n 27 \ngenetic similarity would reflect a common origin predating the last glacial period. 594 \nTherefore, contemporary Scottish populations may originate from western populations 595 \nthat survived the last glaciation in southwestern parts of the British Isles, western 596 \ncontinental Europe (Ballantyne and Harris, 1994; Bennett, 1995) or now-submerged parts 597 \nof the continental shelf. Future genetic studies at more loci (including new mtDNA 598 \nmarkers) and in more populations would allow more precise assessment of the spatial 599 \ndistribution of haplotypes in Scottish and mainland populations and testing of 600 \ncolonisation hypotheses. This should soon be feasible as new genomic resources for pine, 601 \nincluding multiple nuclear and mtDNA loci, are currently being developed (e.g. through 602 \nthe EVOLTREE Network of Excellence).   603 \n  604 \nEffects of selection at individual loci  605 \nAt mutation-drift equilibrium, genetic drift and gene flow influence the level of 606 \ndifferentiation between populations for selectively neutral markers (Kawecki and Ebert, 607 \n2004; Savolainen et al, 2007). Little differentiation between Scottish and mainland 608 \nEuropean populations of Scots pine at neutral markers (Kinloch et al, 1986; Provan et al, 609 \n1998; Prus-Glowacki and Stephan, 1994) but divergence at quantitative traits for 610 \ncharacters of adaptive importance (e.g. phenology, growth and survival rates, Ennos et al, 611 \n1998; Worrell, 1992, Hurme et al. 1997) suggests that selection is driving adaptive 612 \ndifferentiation in both geographical regions. As they differ significantly in climatic, 613 \nedaphic and biotic conditions, it is possible that observed nucleotide and\/or haplotype 614 \ndifferentiation at dhn2 and dhn7 and some differences in the allele-frequency spectrum at 615 \ndhy2PP, abaR, a3iP2 and chcs may be due to selection. Similarly, reduced nucleotide 616 \n 28 \nand haplotype diversity and a difference in the frequency and distribution of 617 \npolymorphism found at lp3-1 and ccoaomt in the western as compared to the southern 618 \nand eastern groups of Scottish populations could have been affected by diversifying 619 \nselection at the range edge where populations are under direct oceanic influence. In 620 \ncontrast, the haplotype dimorphism at lp3-3 could potentially result from the long-term 621 \naction of balancing\n \nselection, maintaining variation across geographical regions. 622 \nHowever, as admixture at lp3-3 cannot be ruled out, a study of nucleotide polymorphism 623 \nin mainland European populations would be necessary to verify whether or not balancing 624 \nselection has been an influence at this locus.  625 \n 626 \nSome of the loci analysed showed distinct nucleotide diversity patterns relative to genetic 627 \nbackground in other species (e.g. lp3-1 and ccoaomt in P. pinaster Eveno et al, 2008, 628 \nccoaomt in P. taeda, Gonz\u00e1lez-Mart\u00ednez et al, 2006a). Although there is accumulating 629 \nevidence on the polygenic character of adaptive traits from QTL studies (Buckler et al, 630 \n2009; Howe et al, 2003), it remains unclear whether or not there are genes of major effect 631 \nthat contribute to adaptive variation in conifers. In the case of Scottish pinewoods, 632 \nadaptation was probably driven by postglacial migration from a predominantly 633 \ncontinental to an oceanic environment over the past ~7000 yrs. For long-lived conifers, 634 \nadaptive differentiation would be expected to occur over several dozens of generations 635 \nafter vicariance. However, even though selection can be very effective in species with 636 \nlarge population sizes, the time since the last glaciation seems too short for pine species 637 \nto have accumulated new mutations that could be rapidly fixed by selection. Adaptive 638 \ndivergence is therefore more likely to result from selection acting on standing variation, 639 \n 29 \nwhich may have arisen in endemic populations that survived last glaciations in Western 640 \nEurope or the British Isles. Moreover, as differentiation at the trait level in forest trees is 641 \nlikely to result from allelic associations among large numbers of loci, rather than changes 642 \nin allelic frequencies at individual loci, the signature of selection may be more readily 643 \ndetectable as covariance of allele frequencies at multiple loci (Derory et al, 2009; Latta, 644 \n2004; Le Corre and Kremer, 2003). Therefore many more loci, including regulatory 645 \nregions (to date, generally omitted from analyses of nucleotide variation in conifers), 646 \nwould need to be studied in parallel before the influence of selection could be verified. 647 \nScottish populations, which show considerable ecological, phenotypic and genetic 648 \ndiversity over short geographic distances, represent an excellent study system for 649 \nmultilocus analysis of complex trait variation (Gonz\u00e1lez-Mart\u00ednez et al, 2006b; Neale and 650 \nSavolainen, 2004). Such studies will, however, have to take into account the potential 651 \nrole of recent population history in shaping patterns of nucleotide diversity, and therefore 652 \nensure that sampling is conducted at sufficient density to control for historical influences. 653 \nAssociation studies of allelic variants and adaptive variation at quantitative traits between 654 \nindividuals from different, locally-adapted populations could also better validate the 655 \nsignatures of selection and the functional role of the nuclear genes studied. 656 \n657 \n 30 \nAcknowledgments 658 \nWW acknowledges financial support from the Polish Ministry of Science (grant nr 659 \n3653\/B\/P01\/2008\/35), NERC and EU Network of Excellence EVOLTREE (mobility 660 \ngrant).

At eight loci, diversity patterns were compared 27 \nbetween Scottish and continental European populations. At these loci, a similar level of 28 \ndiversity (\u03b8sil=~0.01) was found in Scottish vs. mainland European populations contrary 29 \nto expectations for recent colonisation, however less rapid decay of linkage 30 \ndisequilibrium was observed in the former (\u03c1=0.0086\u00b10.0009, \u03c1=0.0245\u00b10.0022 31 \nrespectively). Scottish populations also showed a deficit of rare nucleotide variants 32 \n(multilocus Tajima\u2019s D=0.316 vs. D=-0.379) and differed significantly from mainland 33 \npopulations in allelic frequency and\/or haplotype structure at several loci. Within 34 \nScotland, western populations showed slightly reduced nucleotide diversity (\u03c0tot=0.0068) 35 \ncompared to those from the south and east (0.0079 and 0.0083, respectively) and about 36 \nthree times higher recombination to diversity ratio (\u03c1 \/ \u03b8=0.71 versus 0.15 and 0.18, 37 \nrespectively). By comparison with results from coalescent simulations, the observed 38 \nallelic frequency spectrum in the western populations was compatible with a relatively 39 \nrecent bottleneck (0.00175 x 4Ne generations) that reduced the population to about 2% of 40 \nthe present size. However heterogeneity in the allelic frequency distribution among 41 \ngeographical regions in Scotland suggests that subsequent admixture of populations with 42 \ndifferent demographic histories may also have played a role. 43 \n44 \n 3 \nIntroduction 45 \nNucleotide polymorphism is influenced by several factors including mutation, migration, 46 \nselection and random genetic drift. In tree species, the current increase in sequence data 47 \ngathered from nuclear gene loci has been driven mostly by the search for the molecular 48 \nsignature of natural selection (Achaz, 2009; Neale and Ingvarsson, 2008; Savolainen and 49 \nPyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi, 2007). Selection can leave its traces as deviations from neutrality in the level 50 \nof nucleotide diversity, allele frequency distribution or correlation between polymorphic 51 \nsites (linkage disequilibrium) (Achaz, 2009). However, the capability to detect selection 52 \nat individual loci is heavily dependent on the assumptions of the neutral model (e.g. 53 \nconstant long term population size, random mating), the strength of, and time since, 54 \nselection and the number of loci involved (and their relative effect) in selectively-55 \ninfluenced traits (Wright and Gaut, 2005). Therefore, prior to testing for selection, 56 \ndatasets must be evaluated for violations of neutral model assumptions. Such processes, 57 \ne.g. historical changes in population size and distribution, may drive deviations from 58 \nneutrality that mimic the effect of selection. However, these effects are expected to be 59 \ngenome-wide and so can be distinguished from selective influences by simultaneous 60 \nassessment of data from multiple loci. Although the patterns of variation in the majority 61 \nof nuclear loci studied to date obey neutral expectations and the signature of selection has 62 \nbeen elusive (Savolainen and Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi, 2007) polymorphisms at nuclear loci provide 63 \nhighly valuable insights into evolutionary history (Heuertz et al, 2006; Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 64 \n2007). 65 \n 66 \n 4 \nAll northern European tree populations have experienced substantial historical changes in 67 \ndistribution. For example, palynological and phylogeographic data indicate that during 68 \nthe last glacial maximum (25-18 000 years ago (ya)), most species were confined to the 69 \nsouthern peninsulas (Iberia, Italy and the Balkans) and some parts of eastern and central 70 \nEurope (Cheddadi et al, 2006; Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2008; Willis and van Andel, 2004) and 71 \nonly reached their most northerly limits around 9000 ya. The recolonization history of 72 \nforest trees, accompanied by adaptation to local environments, has potentially influenced 73 \nthe pattern of nucleotide diversity both among locally adapted populations and between 74 \nrange edge populations and putative refugial populations. In theory, population 75 \nbottlenecks reduce nucleotide diversity in range-edge populations relative to that in 76 \nsource populations, although this is dependent on the timing and severity of the 77 \nbottleneck. In contrast, admixture of populations due, for example, to recolonization from 78 \ndifferent refugia, may increase diversity (Petiti et al. 2003). However, recent studies in 79 \ncontinental European populations of Scots pine (Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007) and Norway 80 \nspruce (Heuertz et al, 2006) found little evidence at the nucleotide level for the effects of 81 \nrecent (post-glacial) population size changes during migration and suggested bottlenecks 82 \nin the mid-to-late Pleistocene. In addition, similar to other predominantly outcrossing tree 83 \nspecies with highly efficient long distance gene flow via pollen (Hamrick et al, 1992), 84 \nneutral genetic differentiation between Scots pine populations is low. For instance, 85 \nmarginal population differentiation was reported for neutral markers between Finnish 86 \npopulations (Karhu et al, 1996), between Scandinavian and eastern parts of the range\n \n87 \n(Wang et al, 1991) and, at several candidate gene loci for growth\n \nphenology and cold 88 \ntolerance, among populations along a latitudinal\n \ncline in continental Europe (Dvornyk et 89 \n 5 \nal, 2002; Garc\u00eda-Gil et al, 2003). The large population sizes of forest trees and capability 90 \nfor maintenance of high levels of genetic variation within populations seems to further 91 \nbuffer against rapid changes in genetic diversity, but causes difficulties in detection of 92 \nrecent demographic processes. If the migrations following the most recent glaciations are 93 \nto have left any signature at all in contemporary populations of forest trees, it seems 94 \nlikely to be detectable only where populations have experienced severe bottlenecks or 95 \nbecame rapidly isolated.  96 \n 97 \nIn Scotland, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is at the extreme north-western edge of its 98 \nvast distribution, which reaches across Europe and Asia and is the largest of any pine 99 \nspecies (Critchfield and Little, 1965). Pines first colonized the land that became the 100 \nBritish Isles about 10 000 ya, at around the time that Ireland became isolated, and reached 101 \nnorthern Scotland by about 9000 years ago (Huntley and Birks, 1983; Svendsen et al, 102 \n1999). According to  fossil data in Scotland, pine first appeared in the Wester Ross region 103 \nin the northwest, and then shortly afterwards in the Cairngorms in the east (Birks, 1989). 104 \nThe subsequent formation of the English Channel (c.6000 ya) and competition from 105 \nbroadleaved species in southern Britain left Scottish pinewoods physically separated by at 106 \nleast 500 km from mainland populations in continental Europe. Nowadays, native 107 \npinewoods in Scotland cover about 18 000 hectares, in 84 differently-sized fragments 108 \npatchily distributed within a ~ 200 x 200 km area across significant environmental 109 \ngradients in altitude, soil type, growing season length and annual rainfall mainly in the 110 \neast-west direction (e.g. annual rainfall varies from 700 to 3000 mm across 160 km) 111 \n(Mason et al, 2004). Small-scale provenance experiments have shown genetic variation 112 \n 6 \nbetween Scottish populations from different locations, e.g. in root frost hardiness and 113 \ngrowth in seedlings (Perks and McKay, 1997) and differentiation among populations at 114 \nseveral quantitative traits (Perks and Ennos, 1999). There is reasonable evidence from 115 \npollen (Birks, 1989), allozymes, monoterpenes and mtDNA (Kinloch et al, 1986; Sinclair 116 \net al, 1998) suggesting a west\/east population subdivision within Scotland and that 117 \npopulations from these regions may have different origins (Ballantyne and Harris, 1994; 118 \nBennett, 1995). Given the iconic status of Scots pine in Scotland and the severe 119 \nfragmentation of the population, there is considerable interest in evaluating its population 120 \nhistory.  121 \n 122 \nIn this study, we focus on the Scottish Scots pine population as a unique and isolated 123 \noceanic fragment at the northwest extreme of the distribution to assess whether recent 124 \ndemographic processes have influenced patterns of nucleotide variation. We analysed 125 \npatterns of nucleotide diversity, allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium in a 126 \nmultilocus nuclear gene dataset in samples gathered from multiple locations within 127 \nputatively divergent regions within Scotland and compared our data to those from 128 \nsamples from northern and central Europe, Turkey and Spain. Using this data and 129 \ncoalescent simulation analysis, we aimed to assess whether Scottish populations show the 130 \nmolecular signature of demographic history and the extent to which they are 131 \ndifferentiated from those in continental Europe. 132 \n133 \n 7 \nMaterials and Methods 134 \nSampling and DNA extraction 135 \nSeed samples from 21 locations in Scotland were included in the study (Figure 1.). The 136 \ntrees were sampled across an environmental gradient related to differences in altitude, 137 \nlength of growing season, annual rainfall and average mean temperature in winter 138 \n(Supplementary Table S1). Cones were collected from mature trees in recognised old-growth 139 \nScots pine forest; at these sites trees are typically over 150 years old and often much older 140 \n(Steven and Carlisle, 1959). Trees were separated by at least 50 m to minimise sampling of 141 \nclosely related individuals. Sampling included the seven currently adopted seed zones of the 142 \nspecies in Scotland, from each of which 3 locations were sampled, 2 individuals per 143 \nlocation.  144 \nFor most of the between-population analyses the samples were grouped according 145 \nto climatic characteristics into three geographical locations \u2013 western, southern and 146 \neastern, represented by eighteen, twelve and twelve individuals, respectively (Figure 1, 147 \nSupplementary Table S1). The western group has the lowest mean altitude (~142m), the 148 \nlongest growing season (~ 240 days), highest mean temperature in winter (~ 2\n0\nC) and 149 \nhigh annual rainfall (~ 2000mm). The eastern group has the highest mean altitude 150 \n(~372m), the shortest growing season (~175 days), and is the coldest (-0.1\n0\nC) and driest 151 \n(~1050mm) part of the distribution, whilst southern group was intermediate between 152 \nthese extremes except for annual rainfall (~2130mm). Field trials have demonstrated 153 \ngenetic differences in phenology and growth rate among provenances originating within 154 \nthese groups  (Perks and Ennos, 1999).  155 \nGenomic DNA was extracted from haploid megagametophyte, maternal tissue 156 \nwhich surrounds the embryo in the seed. As DNA samples were haploid, the haplotypes 157 \n 8 \ncould be determined by direct sequencing. In total, 42 DNA extracts were prepared, 158 \nrepresenting two different trees from each location. Seeds were germinated for a few days 159 \nin moisturized petri dishes and then extracted following a standard CTAB 160 \n(cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) protocol with addition of PVP to 1% concentration 161 \nin the lysis buffer.  162 \n 163 \nLoci studied 164 \nIn total, sixteen nuclear loci were analysed. This included several dehydrin genes that 165 \nwere identified in expression studies in Scots pine (Joosen et al, 2006). Based on the 166 \nnumber and position of the conserved segments (Close 1997), we analysed the class SK4 167 \nof dehydrins (dhn1), SK2 (dhn2) and a group of K2 genes (dhn3 and dhn7). We analysed 168 \nalso SK type of dehydrin upregulated by water stress in Pinus taeda roots (Eveno et al, 169 \n2007) and a putative dehydrin (dhy-like) described for Scots pine (Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007). 170 \nOther loci described in more detail in original papers include abscissic acid responsive 171 \nprotein (abaR) (Wachowiak et al, 2009); early response to dehydration 3 protein (erd3), 172 \nabscissic acid, water dehydrative stress and ripening induced gene family members 1 and 173 \n3 (lp3-1, lp3-3), Caffeoyl CoA O-methyltransferase (ccoaomt), putative arabinogalactan\/ 174 \nproline-rich protein (PR-AGP4-1) and putative arabinogalactan\/ glycin-rich protein 175 \n(grp3) (Eveno et al, 2007); ABI3-interacting protein 2 (a3ip2), alcohol dehydrogenase C 176 \n(adhC) and chalcone synthase (chcs) (Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007).  177 \nIn previous work, ten loci (dhn1,2,3,7, dhy-like, dhy2PP, abaR, a3ip2, adhC, 178 \nchcs) were analysed in Scots pine from the continental European range including fifteen 179 \nsamples from Northern Europe (populations from Northern and Southern Finland and 180 \n 9 \nSweden), fifteen from Central Europe (Poland, Austria and France), and five from each 181 \nof Turkey and Spain (Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007; Wachowiak et al, 2009). The reference 182 \nsequences of eight loci in total (excluding dhy-like and adhC, see below) were compared 183 \nwith those from Scottish populations. The samples from the Iberian Peninsula and Turkey 184 \nwere treated separately in between-region comparisons as they display specific 185 \nmitochondrial types not observed in mainland European distribution of the species which 186 \nsuggests different histories and no contribution to recolonization after last glaciation 187 \n(Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2008; Soranzo et al, 2000).  188 \n 189 \nPCR amplification and sequencing 190 \nPCR-amplification was performed with PTC-200 (MJ Research) and carried out in a total 191 \nvolume of 25\u00b5l containing about 10ng of haploid template DNA, 50\u00b5M of each of dNTP, 192 \n0.2\u00b5M of each primer and 0.25U Taq DNA polymerase with the respective 1x PCR 193 \nbuffer (NovaZyme, Poland). PCR followed standard amplification procedures with 194 \nMgCl2 concentration optimised for each primer pair as described in Supplementary Table 195 \nS2. PCR fragments were purified using QIAquick\nTM\nPCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). 196 \nAbout 20 ng of PCR product was used as a template in 10 \u00b5l sequencing reactions with 197 \nthe Big Dye Terminator DNA Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) performed by the 198 \nGenePool sequencing service, University of Edinburgh. All samples were sequenced in 199 \nboth directions. CodonCode Aligner software was used for editing and assembling of the 200 \nsequence chromatograms to produce alignments based on nucleotide sequence from both 201 \nDNA strands. Haplotype sequences of each locus reported in this paper are deposited in 202 \nthe EMBL sequence database under accession numbers GQ262040 \u2013 GQ262490. 203 \n 10 \n 204 \nSequence analysis   205 \nHigh quality sequences were obtained for most of the samples at twelve loci (Table 1). 206 \nPCR amplification or sequencing failed in most of the samples at dhy-like, adhC and grp3 207 \nand these loci, together with PR-AGP4-1 which was monomorphic across all 42 samples, 208 \nwere excluded from further analysis. Nucleotide sequence alignments were constructed in 209 \nClustalX and were further manually adjusted using GenDoc. All sequence 210 \npolymorphisms were visually rechecked from chromatograms edited with BioEdit. 211 \nCoding and noncoding regions (introns, UTRs) were annotated based on the NCBI 212 \n(http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/) sequence information at each locus and web-based gene 213 \nidentification tool at PlantGDB (http:\/\/www.plantgdb.org\/cgibin\/PlantGDB\/GeneSeqer\/ 214 \nPlantGDBgs.cgi). The influence of demography on the multilocus pattern of variation and 215 \nlocus specific effects were assessed by looking at the amount of nucleotide diversity, 216 \ncorrelation between polymorphic sites and allelic frequency distribution between 217 \ndifferent geographical locations in Scotland and in comparison to mainland populations 218 \nof the species and by comparing observed statistics with simulated values under a range 219 \nof demographic scenarios. Neutrality tests at intraspecific level were applied to search for 220 \ndepartures from a neutral model of evolution. Sequences from Pinus pinaster were used 221 \nas an outgroup for intraspecific comparisons to test for a signal of longer term selection.  222 \n 223 \nNucleotide diversity  224 \nTwo measures of nucleotide diversity were applied: 1) an average number of nucleotide 225 \ndifferences per nucleotide site between two sequences , (Nei, 1987) calculated with 226 \n 11 \nDNAsp  4.0) and 2) Watterson\u2019s (1975) estimate of the population mutation parameter, 227 \ntheta (\u03b8W, equal to 4Ne\u03bc, where Ne is the effective population size and \u03bc is the mutation 228 \nrate per nucleotide site per generation), computed based on the number of segregating 229 \nsites and the length of each locus using MCMC simulation under a Bayesian model as 230 \npreviously described (Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007). The estimates of nucleotide diversity were 231 \nconducted for all samples combined and separately for south, east and west regional 232 \ngroups of Scottish populations. Scottish and continental European populations were 233 \ncompared at eight loci for which informative data was available (Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007; 234 \nWachowiak et al, 2009). Exceptionally high nucleotide diversity was found at lp3-3 locus 235 \ncompared to other loci in our dataset. Due to the size of the conifer genome and the 236 \noccurrence of multigene families (Ahuja and Neale, 2005), erroneous co-amplification of 237 \ndifferent loci from the same family is possible and may account for unusual diversity 238 \nestimates at specific loci. Therefore, locus lp3-3 was excluded from multilocus or average 239 \nestimates reported in the study to avoid bias and ensure that estimates were conservative; 240 \nthe locus was included in population structure analysis and coalescent simulations.  241 \n 242 \nLinkage disequilibrium and haplotype diversity 243 \nThe level of linkage disequilibrium was measured as the correlation coefficient r\n2  \n 244 \n(Hill and Robertson, 1968) using informative sites. Indels and sites with three nucleotide 245 \nvariants identified in dhn1 (3), dhy2PP (1) were excluded from the analysis. Under 246 \nmutation-drift-equilibrium model, the decay of linkage disequilibrium with physical 247 \ndistance was\n \nestimated using non-linear regression of r\n2 \nbetween polymorphic sites and 248 \nthe distance (in base pairs) between\n \nsites as detailed in (Wachowiak et al, 2009). The 249 \n 12 \nnon-linear least-squares estimate of \u03c1 (\u03c1 = 4Nec, where Ne is effective population size, c 250 \nis the recombination rate) between adjacent sites was fitted by the nls-function 251 \nimplemented in the R statistical package (http:\/\/www.r-project.org). The overall and 252 \ngroup specific least-squares estimates of \u03c1 were computed and compared to other 253 \nestimates in Scots pine (Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007; Wachowiak et al, 2009). 254 \nThe number of haplotypes and haplotype diversity (Hd) were estimated for each 255 \ngene using DNAsp. Insertions and deletions were included in all estimates. Coalescence 256 \nsimulations with locus specific or average \u03c1 for six loci and without recombination were 257 \nused to assess whether there are more or fewer haplotypes than expected and whether 258 \nhaplotype diversity is higher or lower than expected given the number of segregating 259 \nsites. The number of haplotypes and haplotype diversity were calculated for all samples 260 \ncombined and separately for the three regional groups of Scots pine in Scotland. 261 \n 262 \nNeutrality tests 263 \nDeviations of particular genes from the frequency distribution spectrum under the 264 \nstandard neutral model of evolution were assessed with Tajima\u2019s D test (Tajima 1989) 265 \nand Fay and Wu\u2019s H (Fay and Wu 2000). Negative values of Tajima\u2019s D indicate an 266 \nexcess of low frequency polymorphisms consistent with positive directional selection or 267 \nrecent population expansion, whereas positive values indicate an excess of intermediate 268 \nfrequency polymorphism potentially due to balancing selection or population contraction.  269 \nFay and Wu\u2019s H test measures departures from neutrality based on high-frequency 270 \nderived alleles. An excess of high frequency derived alleles compared to neutral 271 \nexpectations may result from recent positive selection or strong population structure with 272 \n 13 \nuneven sampling from populations. The distribution of test statistics was investigated for 273 \neach locus for all populations combined and separately for the three regional groups. 274 \nMultilocus estimates of Tajima\u2019s D were assessed with HKA software 275 \n(http:\/\/lifesci.rutgers.edu\/~heylab). The estimates were also calculated along the sequence 276 \nof each locus by a sliding window of 100 sites with successive displacement of 25 sites. 277 \nAs lack of recombination makes the D test overly conservative (Thornton 2005), the 278 \nsignificance of locus specific and multilocus Tajima\u2019s D was also evaluated by coalescent 279 \nsimulations dependent on population mutation and recombination rate (MANVa software 280 \nwww.ub.edu\/softevol\/manva, based on coalescent program ms, Hudson, 2002). Different 281 \nestimates of \u03c1 including locus specific estimates, lowest and highest value across loci and 282 \naverage value for six loci were used in coalescent simulations. As similar probability 283 \nvalues for multilocus D statistics were observed in simulations with different 284 \nrecombination rate estimates, the results based on the average values of \u03c1 at the analysed 285 \nloci are reported unless otherwise stated.   286 \nFor tests based on nucleotide variation between species we used reference 287 \nsequence data from P. pinaster for outgroup comparison. To assess the correlation 288 \nbetween the level of nucleotide polymorphism and divergence at each locus we applied 1) 289 \nthe McDonald and Kreitman, (1991) test, based on comparison of the pattern of within-290 \nspecies polymorphism and between-species divergence at synonymous and 291 \nnonsynonymous sites in a gene, and 2) HKA test (Hudson et al, 1987) which allows the 292 \ndetection of loci that demonstrate unusual patterns of polymorphism compared to 293 \ndivergence across genes. Comparison of multilocus polymorphism and divergence at all 294 \nsites was assessed using HKA software (http:\/\/lifesci.rutgers.edu\/ ~heylab). The ratio of 295 \n 14 \nnonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous site (Ks) nucleotide divergence from the outgroup 296 \nspecies (Hughes and Nei, 1988) was calculated using DnaSP.  297 \n 298 \nPopulation structure 299 \nTo check if there was a geographical difference in allelic frequency spectra, regional 300 \ngroups of Scottish populations were compared to each other and to previously analyzed 301 \ncontinental European populations from northern and central Europe, Spain and Turkey 302 \n(Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007; Wachowiak et al, 2009). Genetic differentiation between the 303 \nregions was studied locus by locus at both haplotype and SNP\/Indel level and also by 304 \naveraging pairwise FST over all polymorphic sites across loci. The significance of genetic 305 \ndifferentiation was evaluated by 1000 permutations of the samples between groups using 306 \nArlequin ver. 3.0 (Excoffier et al, 2005). Population structure from the haplotypic data 307 \nwas tested by Snn and KST\n* \nstatistics (Hudson et al, 1992; Lynch and Crease, 1990), which 308 \nare more appropriate for sequence-based haplotype data where diversity may be high and 309 \nsample size low, rendering frequency-based approaches problematic. Their significance 310 \nwas evaluated using 1000 permutations, where samples were randomly assigned into 311 \ndifferent groups (Hudson, 2000). Genetic clustering of the individuals based on both full 312 \nsequence data and all segregating sites and indels at 12 loci (for Scottish populations) and 313 \nat 8 loci (for Scottish and mainland European populations) was conducted using BAPS 314 \n5.2 (Corander and Tang, 2007). Polymorphic sites from each locus were treated as linked 315 \nmolecular data to account for dependence between segregating sites in the gene. 316 \nCompletely linked sites (r\n2\n=1) were excluded from the analysis.  317 \n 318 \nCoalescent simulations 319 \n 15 \nTo further infer the demographic history of Scottish Scots pine populations we compared 320 \nthe observed distribution of average Tajima\u2019s D and Fay and Wu\u2019s H at the candidate loci 321 \nseparately in the western, southern and eastern group and in all geographic regions 322 \ncombined to the simulated values under several demographic scenarios including the 323 \nstandard neutral model (constant population size), growth model and bottleneck model 324 \nfollowed by exponential growth (Supplementary Figure S4). Regional groups of 325 \npopulations were analysed separately as detailed aspects of the frequency spectrum may 326 \ndiffer between groups that are not differentiated based on genetic clustering methods 327 \n(Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al 2007). Coalescent simulations were run independently for each locus and 328 \nvarious demographic scenarios using the program ms (Hudson 2002) and the approach 329 \ndescribed by Haddrill et al (2005). In each case, 5000 replicates were simulated for each 330 \nlocus. The analyses were performed with recombination using the locus specific (when 331 \navailable) or average value of \u03c1 per site for the analysed loci in each geographic group 332 \n(Table 2, Supplementary Table S3). We tested various bottleneck scenarios of different 333 \nage and severity. The time from the end of the bottleneck (measured in units of 4N0 334 \ngenerations from the present) ranged from 0.0002 to 0.05 and bottleneck severities 335 \n(measured in units of the current\n \npopulation size) from 0.001 to 0.5. Assuming for 336 \ninstance, Ne of 200000 and generation time of 25 years, the time range corresponds to 337 \nbetween 4 000 and 1 million years and severity from 0.1 to 50% of the current population 338 \nsize. In most bottleneck models tested, the ancestral and current effective population sizes 339 \nwere assumed to be equal, bottleneck duration (f) was fixed to f=0.0015 (units of 4N0 340 \ngenerations from the present) and the growth rate of 10 was constant across simulations 341 \nas in previous studies (Heuertz et al. 2006). A subset of simulations were run also with 342 \n 16 \nf=0.006 and corresponding equal or doubled ancestral population size as compared to the 343 \ncurrent one, and also separately for a set of 11 and 9 loci (excluding lp3-3 and dhn1 and 344 \nabaR, respectively as the later showed some evidence of selection). A schematic 345 \nrepresentation of the simulated bottleneck model is shown in Supplementary Figure S4. 346 \nThe simulation results for each demographic scenario were summarized using the 347 \nprogram analyser HKA. The perl script multitest_pop1.pl was used to perform multilocus 348 \ntests of ms-generated genealogies (including P-values of the observed mean values of 349 \nTajima\u2019s D and Fay and Wu\u2019s H statistics) summarized using analyser HKA. The 350 \nprograms are available from http:\/\/genomics.princeton.edu\/ 351 \nAndolfattoLab\/Andolfatto_Lab.html. 352 \n 353 \nResults  354 \nNucleotide polymorphism and divergence 355 \nThe average total nucleotide diversity ( ) in Scottish populations at eleven loci was \u03c0tot = 356 \n0.0078 and at nonsynonymous sites was \u03c0ns = 0.0031 (Table 2). Slightly lower average 357 \nnucleotide diversity was found in the west (\u03c0tot = 0.0068) as compared to southern and 358 \neastern regional groups (\u03c0tot = 0.0079 and 0.0083, respectively) and similar values were 359 \nfound at nonsynonymous sites (\u03c0ns= ~ 0.003) (Supplementary Table S3). Multilocus 360 \nestimates of silent Watterson theta  was \u03b8sil=0.0095 (with 95% credibility intervals of 361 \n0.0074-0.0122) for all Scottish populations combined, \u03b8sil=0.0086 (0.0063-0.0117) in the 362 \nwest, \u03b8sil=0.0111 (0.0080-0.0152) in the south and \u03b8sil=0.0103 (0.0074-0.0143) in the 363 \neast. In comparisons between Scottish vs. mainland European populations at eight loci, 364 \nsimilar but slightly higher average values of total nucleotide diversity (\u03c0tot = 0.0070 vs 365 \n 17 \n0.0062) and silent multilocous theta (\u03b8sil=0.0108 vs. 0.0093) were found in Scottish 366 \npopulations (Table 3). 367 \n 368 \nLinkage\n \ndisequilibrium and haplotype polymorphisms 369 \nRapid decay of linkage\n \ndisequilibrium between pairs of parsimony informative sites at 370 \neleven loci was found in Scottish populations, with \u03c1 = 0.0085 \u00b1 0.0009 (Table 2) and 371 \nexpected r\n2 \nvalues of 0.2 at\n \na distance of about 400 bp. The decay of linkage\n \n372 \ndisequilibrium in the western group (\u03c1 = 0.0074 \u00b1 0.0008) was more rapid as compared to 373 \nthe south (0.0025 \u00b1 0.0004) and east (0.0024 \u00b10.0006) (Figure 2) and the pattern was 374 \nconstant at most loci (Supplementary Table S3). Overall, Scottish populations had about 375 \nthree times slower decay of linkage\n \ndisequilibrium as compared to mainland populations 376 \nat the same set of eight loci of similar sample size (\u03c1 = 0.0086 \u00b1 0.0009 vs  377 \n0.0245\u00b10.0022, respectively) (Supplementary Figure S1). However, the rate of decay of 378 \nLD and the relative level of recombination to diversity (\u03c1 \/ \u03b8 ratio) were similar between 379 \nwestern Scottish and north and central European regions (Table 3) but these parameters 380 \nwere over three times smaller in southern and eastern groups of Scotland.  381 \nThe average number of haplotypes per gene was 12 and haplotype diversity was very 382 \nhigh (Hd=0.789\u00b10.042). Similar haplotype diversity was found in western (Hd 383 \n=0.754\u00b10.077), southern (Hd=0.819\u00b10.088) and eastern (Hd=0.800\u00b10.090) groups 384 \n(Supplementary Table S3). Haplotype diversity was slightly higher than mainland 385 \nEuropean populations at the same set of eight loci (Hd=0.831\u00b10.038 vs Hd=0.795\u00b10.051) 386 \nand also compared to previous estimates for Scots pine (Hd=0.683\u00b10.059, Wachowiak et 387 \nal. 2009). Locus Lp3-3 contained two sets of haplotypes (each of 18 samples equally 388 \n 18 \ndistributed across three geographical groups) with highly reduced levels of nucleotide 389 \npolymorphism (\u03c0tot = 0.0090 and 0.0074, respectively) as compared to the whole gene 390 \nestimate (\u03c0tot = 0.0370) and a ten-fold difference in the level of divergence (Ksil1=0.013 vs 391 \nKsil2=0.116) (Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary Figure S2). A neutral 392 \ncoalescence process, compatible with a constant-size\n \nneutral model without 393 \nrecombination or erroneous coamplifications of different gene family members could 394 \npotentially generate such a pattern. However, no reading-frame shifts or premature stop 395 \ncodons, which would suggest the presence of non-functional alleles, were found at the 396 \nlocus.  397 \n 398 \nNeutrality tests 399 \nTendency towards an excess of old over recent mutations across genes was detected by 400 \nmultilocus Tajima's D at eleven loci in the total data set (D=0.118) (Table 2), in the 401 \nwestern (D=0.364), southern (D=0.103) and eastern (D=0.260) groups (Supplementary 402 \nTable S3). Significant excess of intermediate frequency mutations was found at dhn2 403 \n(D=1.968, P<0.05) and lp3-3 (D=2.846, P<0.01). Statistically significant positive values 404 \nof Tajima\u2019s D were identified in sliding window analyses in a few regions within dhn2 (D 405 \n= 2.36-2.48 at 307\u2013449 bp), a3ip2 (D = 2.22 at 401-501 bp) and lp3-3 (D = 2.13-3.18 at 406 \n51\u2013454 bp) loci. Overall, an excess of high-frequency derived variants indicated by 407 \nnegative mean values of Fay and Wu\u2019s H statistics was found in all Scottish populations 408 \n(H= -0.494) (Table 2), in the west (H= -0.447) and east (H= -0.145) groups, but slightly 409 \npositive values were found in the south (H= 0.144) (Supplementary Table S3). The 410 \naggregated Scottish populations show a deficit of rare variants (multilocus Tajima\u2019s 411 \n 19 \nD=0.316) as compared to mainland European populations (D=-0.379). Both geographical 412 \nregions show negative mean value of Fay and Wu\u2019s H statistics (H=-0.564 and -1.240, 413 \nrespectively) indicating an excess of high-frequency derived SNPs (Table 3).  414 \nAn excess of fixed nonsynonymous over fixed synonymous substitutions and 415 \npolymorphic sites was found at dhn1 locus in McDonald-Kreitman test (Fisher\u2019s exact 416 \ntest, P = 0.05), as previously found in European mainland populations (Wachowiak et al, 417 \n2009). An excess of nonsynonymous sites as compared to synonymous sites was found at 418 \nabaR (Supplementary Table S5). The level of divergence was similar across all sites and 419 \nat silent sites only (~4%), and was slightly lower than previous estimates for Scots pine 420 \n(K=~0.05, Wachowiak et al. 2009). Overall, positive correlation between polymorphism 421 \nand divergence (HKA test) was found at eleven loci combined.   422 \n 423 \nPopulation differentiation 424 \nDifferentiation between Scottish populations 425 \nSignificant differentiation measured as an average over all polymorphic sites was found 426 \nbetween southern and eastern groups at dhn1 (FST=0.034, P<0.05) and between southern 427 \nand eastern as compared to the western group at ccoaomt (FST=0.149, P<0.05 and FST 428 \n=0.102, P<0.01, respectively) and lp3-1 (FST =0.100, P<0.05 and FST =0.197, P<0.001, 429 \nrespectively) (Supplementary Table S6). A difference in frequency of indel 430 \npolymorphisms at dhn1, four silent substitutions and indel polymorphisms at lp3-1 and 431 \nabsence of four silent polymorphisms in the western group as compared to the others at 432 \nccoaomt locus contributed the most to the differentiation between groups. Based on 433 \nhaplotype differentiation, the western group differed from the southern group at a3ip 434 \n 20 \n(Snn=0.629, P<0.05), lp3-1 (Snn=0.758, P<0.01) and at ccoaomt and lp3-1 based on KST 435 \nstatistics (KST = 0.066 and 0.051, P<0.05, respectively). They also differ from the east 436 \ngroup at lp3-1 locus (KST=0.075, P<0.05). Significant FST statistics based on haplotype 437 \nfrequency were found for lp3-1 in the south and east as compared to western group 438 \n(P<0.05) and nearly significant values for ccoaomt between south and west groups 439 \n(P=0.06) (Supplementary Table S6). No difference between west-south, west-east and 440 \nsouth-east groups were found based on average FST over all polymorphic sites and indels 441 \ncombined across the loci (FST =-0.013, -0.013, and 0.01, respectively).  442 \n 443 \nDifferentiation between Scottish vs European continental populations 444 \nBased on allele frequency and\/or haplotype diversity statistics Scottish populations were 445 \ndifferentiated from continental European populations at six out of eight loci analysed 446 \n(Supplementary Table S7). Significant population differentiation (FST), measured both as 447 \nan average over polymorphic sites and at the haplotype level, was found at dhn2, dhn7, 448 \nabaR and chcs. Based on the average proportion of nearest-neighbor haplotypes that are 449 \npresent in the same locality (Snn) both groups were differentiated at dhn2, dhn7, dhy2PP 450 \nand a3iP (P<0.001-0.05). Two loci, dhn2 and dhn7, also showed high similarity between 451 \npairs of sequences derived from each region (KST = 0.098 and 0.067, respectively, 452 \nP<0.01).  453 \nSignificant differentiation was found between Scottish populations versus continental 454 \nEuropean populations measured as an average of FST values over all polymorphic sites 455 \ndetected (Table 4). The only exceptions include southern Scottish populations as 456 \n 21 \ncompared to northern and central Europe, eastern Scottish compared to northern 457 \nEuropean and western Scottish compared to Spanish populations.  458 \nAnalysis of genetic clustering with full sequence data gave the best support for all 459 \nindividuals from European mainland and Scottish populations at eight loci and for 460 \nindividuals from Scottish populations at 12 loci belonging to one genetic cluster. At all 461 \npolymorphic sites and indels at both eight and twelve loci, the best support was obtained 462 \nfor four clusters, but without clear pattern of geographical distribution (Supplementary 463 \nFigure S3).  464 \n 465 \nCoalescent simulations 466 \nFor each geographic group of Scottish Scots pine populations the observed pattern of the 467 \nfrequency distribution spectrum was not compatible with either the standard neutral or 468 \ngrowth models. In simulations under the SNM and growth model\n the mean Tajima\u2019s D 469 \nwas significantly lower and Fay and Wu\u2019s H significantly higher than the observed values 470 \nexcept for the southern group, the only one with positive mean H values (Table 5, 471 \nSupplementary Table S8). Among the 20 different bottleneck models tested the most 472 \ncompatible for the western group was a relatively recent bottleneck (t=0.00125) that 473 \nreduced the population to 2% of the present size followed\n \nby moderate population growth 474 \n(Table 5, Supplementary Table 9). This model also held for the eastern group but was 475 \nalways rejected for the southern group, where different bottleneck scenarios never lead to 476 \npositive values for both Tajima\u2019s D and Fay and Wu\u2019s H statistics (Supplementary Table 477 \n9). In general, the simulations indicate heterogeneity in the allelic frequency distribution 478 \namong geographic regions in Scotland.  479 \n 22 \nDiscussion 480 \nMultilocus signatures of population history 481 \nThe Scottish populations showed clear molecular signatures of different demographic 482 \nhistories. Across all regions, the allele frequency distribution was skewed towards 483 \nintermediate frequency polymorphisms, and the rate of decline of linkage disequilibrium 484 \nwas reduced and nucleotide diversity levels were equivalent to or higher than continental 485 \nEuropean populations of the species. The skew of allelic frequency distribution, apparent 486 \nas positive values of Tajima\u2019s D, was in clear contrast to previous reports for this species 487 \nin continental Europe (Palm\u00e9 et al, 2008; Wachowiak et al, 2009) and for published 488 \nstudies of other species (North American Douglas fir, Eckert et al, 2009; P. taeda 489 \nGonz\u00e1lez-Mart\u00ednez et al, 2006a; other conifer species Savolainen and Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi, 2007; 490 \nEuropean Quercus petraea Derory et al, 2009; Populus tremula Ingvarsson, 2005) where 491 \nnegative values of Tajima\u2019s D have been found. In these species, the excess of low 492 \nfrequency derived mutations has been ascribed to the influence of postglacial range 493 \nexpansion (Brown et al, 2004; Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007) or potentially the influence of 494 \nrecurrent selective sweeps (e.g. Eckert et al, 2009). In contrast, rather than range 495 \nexpansion, the bias towards intermediate-frequency polymorphisms in Scottish 496 \npopulations suggests the influence of a bottleneck although, as shown in recent 497 \nsimulation studies, a skew of allelic frequency variants may also result from pooling local 498 \nsamples with different demographic histories (St\u00e4dler et al, 2009). However, the 499 \nbottleneck hypothesis was also supported by the overall pattern of linkage disequilibrium 500 \n(LD), which showed a reduced rate of decline relative to continental European 501 \npopulations of the species. In coalescent simulations, the bottleneck scenario fits best for 502 \n 23 \nwestern populations and the data were compatible with a relatively recent, severe 503 \nbottleneck. Depending on the effective population size and generation time assumed, this 504 \nbottleneck ended a maximum of a few tens of thousands of years ago (e.g about 25 000 505 \nya assuming Ne=200 000). Bottlenecking is expected to increase association (correlation 506 \namong sites with distance) of alleles and polymorphic sites across loci.  In Scottish 507 \npopulations, the decay of LD was almost three times slower than that in mainland 508 \npopulations. Reduced decay  of LD has also been observed in populations of American P. 509 \ntaeda that had probably experienced bottlenecks (Brown et al, 2004; Gonz\u00e1lez-Mart\u00ednez 510 \net al, 2006a) and contrasting allele frequency distributions were observed between 511 \nnorthern populations and recently bottlenecked southern populations of Quercus crispula 512 \nin Japan (where the latter showed positive Tajima\u2019s D, Quang et al, 2008).  513 \n 514 \nAlthough there are exceptions (Grivet et al, 2009), it is expected that bottlenecks should 515 \nhave a stronger impact on the allele frequency distribution spectrum and LD than on the 516 \noverall level of diversity (Wright et al, 2005). Long-lived, wind-pollinated tree species 517 \nshould be capable of maintaining genetic diversity even during range shifts; i.e. they are 518 \nbuffered against rapid changes in genetic variation due to fluctuations in population size 519 \n(Austerlitz et al, 2000). Indeed, relative to mainland European populations of Scots pine, 520 \nScottish populations did not show a decline in nucleotide diversity, as is expected where 521 \ncolonisation has been relatively recent (Nei et al, 1975; Pannell and Dorken, 2006). In 522 \nfact, genetic variation in Scottish populations seems to be slightly higher than in 523 \nmainland populations (\u03b8sil=0.011 vs 0.009, respectively) and relative to previous 524 \nestimates for the species (\u03b8sil= 0.005 at 16 loci with some related to timing of bud set 525 \n 24 \n(Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2007) and \u03b8sil=0.0089 at 14 cold tolerance candidate loci (Wachowiak et 526 \nal, 2009)). Compared to estimates in other forest tree species, overall diversity in Scottish 527 \npopulations ( tot=0.0078) is only lower than that in broadleaved Populus tremula (0.0111, 528 \nIngvarsson, 2005) and is higher than that in Q. crispula, (0.0069, Quang and Harada 529 \n2008), Q. petraea (0.0062, Derory et al. 2009), P. pinaster  (0.0055, Eveno et al. 2008), 530 \nP. taeda (0.0040, Brown et al, 2004), Picea abies (0.0039, Heuertz et al, 2007) and other 531 \nconifers (Savolainen and Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi, 2007). The diversity estimate for Scottish 532 \npopulations is compatible with the patterns of genetic variation observed in previous 533 \nstudies  (monoterpenes Forrest, 1980; Forrest, 1982), allozymes Kinloch et al, 1986), 534 \nchloroplast DNA microsatellite markers Provan et al, 1998).  535 \n 536 \nAlthough it seems clear that bottlenecking has been an influence on Scottish populations, 537 \nestimation of the timing of the event is heavily dependent on various assumptions 538 \nincluding the effective population size and generation time estimates. For instance, in 539 \ncontinental populations of Norway spruce and Scots pine, simulation studies suggested a 540 \nrather ancient bottleneck that ended several hundred thousand to more than one million 541 \nyears ago, respectively (Lascoux et al, 2008). In our data, coalescent simulation of 542 \nvarious demographic scenarios supported the conclusion that bottlenecking had occurred, 543 \nbut suggested more recent timing. A similar signal, suggesting bottlenecking on a 544 \ntimescale related to the most recent glaciation, was detected in Italian populations of 545 \nAleppo pine (Grivet et al, 2009). Furthermore, the severity of the bottleneck experienced 546 \nby Scottish populations appears to have been strong enough to account for the observed 547 \n 25 \ndiscrepancy in allelic frequency distributions and decay of LD, in contrast to continental 548 \nEuropean tree populations (Lascoux et al, 2008).  549 \n 550 \nHowever, as we observed heterogeneity in the pattern of nucleotide diversity among 551 \nregions within Scotland, it seems likely that different parts of the population have 552 \nexperienced different demographic histories.  The ratio of recombination to diversity and 553 \nthe level of linkage disequilibrium in western Scottish populations were similar to those 554 \nin mainland European populations but about three times higher than those in southern and 555 \neastern Scottish groups. Various bottleneck scenarios could be clearly rejected for the 556 \nsouthern group in our coalescent simulation analysis. The homogenizing effects of gene 557 \nflow on genetic diversity are well known for highly outcrossing wind pollinated species, 558 \nand there is evidence for historically high gene flow among Scottish populations from 559 \nwork using chloroplast markers (Provan et al, 1998). In addition, molecular and isozyme 560 \nstudies provide no suggestion of a difference in outcrossing rates between regions that 561 \ncould account for a difference in spatial distribution of polymorphism (Kinloch et al, 562 \n1986). As, until recently, Scots pine covered large parts of Scotland, differentiation 563 \nbetween regional groups due to genetic drift also seems unlikely, as this should be  most 564 \nsignificant for small populations (Pannell and Dorken, 2006). Inter-regional differences 565 \nalso seem unlikely to be the result of selection. If this was the case, we would expect 566 \ndifferences in the frequency distribution spectrum between groups or at least reduced 567 \ndiversity levels at selected loci. However, the observed dominance of intermediate 568 \nfrequency variants in all groups together with very rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium 569 \n(within a few hundred base pairs) excludes a selective sweep as an explanation. 570 \n 26 \nFurthermore, nucleotide and haplotype diversity is at least as high in southern and eastern 571 \ngroups as in the western group, whereas directional selection should reduce diversity. 572 \nTherefore, overall, historical changes in population size and distribution seem a more 573 \nplausible explanation for the pattern of nucleotide variation in Scottish populations and, 574 \nas a single migration and bottleneck event cannot account for the observed pattern of 575 \ndiversity, it seems that heterogeneity within the Scottish population is most likely to be 576 \nthe result of admixture of populations from different origins.  577 \n 578 \nCompared to continental Europe, southern and eastern groups of Scottish pines showed 579 \nno overall difference in allele frequency distribution at polymorphic sites from north or 580 \ncentral European populations, but differentiation from Spanish and Turkish populations. 581 \nOn the other hand, the western group was significantly differentiated from all mainland 582 \npopulations except those from Spain. In previous studies, populations from the west of 583 \nScotland were more closely related to southern European populations in monoterpene 584 \ncomposition and isozyme frequency (Forrest, 1982) or geographically structured mtDNA 585 \nvariation (Sinclair et al, 1998) than to populations from north-central Europe, which were 586 \nmore similar to the southern and eastern Scottish pinewoods. Similarities between 587 \nwestern Scotland and south European Scots pine could simply be stochastic, due to 588 \nhomogenising selection for similar environments or, alternatively, could reflect common 589 \nancestry of the populations. Genetic similarity at mtDNA markers (maternally transmitted 590 \nin pines) suggests the latter. However, as Iberian populations did not contribute to the 591 \nmost recent recolonization of central and northern Europe (Prus-Glowacki and Stephan, 592 \n1994; Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al, 2008; Soranzo et al, 2000; Tobolski and Hanover, 1971), this 593 \n 27 \ngenetic similarity would reflect a common origin predating the last glacial period. 594 \nTherefore, contemporary Scottish populations may originate from western populations 595 \nthat survived the last glaciation in southwestern parts of the British Isles, western 596 \ncontinental Europe (Ballantyne and Harris, 1994; Bennett, 1995) or now-submerged parts 597 \nof the continental shelf. Future genetic studies at more loci (including new mtDNA 598 \nmarkers) and in more populations would allow more precise assessment of the spatial 599 \ndistribution of haplotypes in Scottish and mainland populations and testing of 600 \ncolonisation hypotheses. This should soon be feasible as new genomic resources for pine, 601 \nincluding multiple nuclear and mtDNA loci, are currently being developed (e.g. through 602 \nthe EVOLTREE Network of Excellence).   603 \n  604 \nEffects of selection at individual loci  605 \nAt mutation-drift equilibrium, genetic drift and gene flow influence the level of 606 \ndifferentiation between populations for selectively neutral markers (Kawecki and Ebert, 607 \n2004; Savolainen et al, 2007). Little differentiation between Scottish and mainland 608 \nEuropean populations of Scots pine at neutral markers (Kinloch et al, 1986; Provan et al, 609 \n1998; Prus-Glowacki and Stephan, 1994) but divergence at quantitative traits for 610 \ncharacters of adaptive importance (e.g. phenology, growth and survival rates, Ennos et al, 611 \n1998; Worrell, 1992, Hurme et al. 1997) suggests that selection is driving adaptive 612 \ndifferentiation in both geographical regions. As they differ significantly in climatic, 613 \nedaphic and biotic conditions, it is possible that observed nucleotide and\/or haplotype 614 \ndifferentiation at dhn2 and dhn7 and some differences in the allele-frequency spectrum at 615 \ndhy2PP, abaR, a3iP2 and chcs may be due to selection. Similarly, reduced nucleotide 616 \n 28 \nand haplotype diversity and a difference in the frequency and distribution of 617 \npolymorphism found at lp3-1 and ccoaomt in the western as compared to the southern 618 \nand eastern groups of Scottish populations could have been affected by diversifying 619 \nselection at the range edge where populations are under direct oceanic influence. In 620 \ncontrast, the haplotype dimorphism at lp3-3 could potentially result from the long-term 621 \naction of balancing\n \nselection, maintaining variation across geographical regions. 622 \nHowever, as admixture at lp3-3 cannot be ruled out, a study of nucleotide polymorphism 623 \nin mainland European populations would be necessary to verify whether or not balancing 624 \nselection has been an influence at this locus.  625 \n 626 \nSome of the loci analysed showed distinct nucleotide diversity patterns relative to genetic 627 \nbackground in other species (e.g. lp3-1 and ccoaomt in P. pinaster Eveno et al, 2008, 628 \nccoaomt in P. taeda, Gonz\u00e1lez-Mart\u00ednez et al, 2006a). Although there is accumulating 629 \nevidence on the polygenic character of adaptive traits from QTL studies (Buckler et al, 630 \n2009; Howe et al, 2003), it remains unclear whether or not there are genes of major effect 631 \nthat contribute to adaptive variation in conifers. In the case of Scottish pinewoods, 632 \nadaptation was probably driven by postglacial migration from a predominantly 633 \ncontinental to an oceanic environment over the past ~7000 yrs. For long-lived conifers, 634 \nadaptive differentiation would be expected to occur over several dozens of generations 635 \nafter vicariance. However, even though selection can be very effective in species with 636 \nlarge population sizes, the time since the last glaciation seems too short for pine species 637 \nto have accumulated new mutations that could be rapidly fixed by selection. Adaptive 638 \ndivergence is therefore more likely to result from selection acting on standing variation, 639 \n 29 \nwhich may have arisen in endemic populations that survived last glaciations in Western 640 \nEurope or the British Isles. Moreover, as differentiation at the trait level in forest trees is 641 \nlikely to result from allelic associations among large numbers of loci, rather than changes 642 \nin allelic frequencies at individual loci, the signature of selection may be more readily 643 \ndetectable as covariance of allele frequencies at multiple loci (Derory et al, 2009; Latta, 644 \n2004; Le Corre and Kremer, 2003). Therefore many more loci, including regulatory 645 \nregions (to date, generally omitted from analyses of nucleotide variation in conifers), 646 \nwould need to be studied in parallel before the influence of selection could be verified. 647 \nScottish populations, which show considerable ecological, phenotypic and genetic 648 \ndiversity over short geographic distances, represent an excellent study system for 649 \nmultilocus analysis of complex trait variation (Gonz\u00e1lez-Mart\u00ednez et al, 2006b; Neale and 650 \nSavolainen, 2004). Such studies will, however, have to take into account the potential 651 \nrole of recent population history in shaping patterns of nucleotide diversity, and therefore 652 \nensure that sampling is conducted at sufficient density to control for historical influences. 653 \nAssociation studies of allelic variants and adaptive variation at quantitative traits between 654 \nindividuals from different, locally-adapted populations could also better validate the 655 \nsignatures of selection and the functional role of the nuclear genes studied. 656 \n657 \n 30 \nAcknowledgments 658 \nWW acknowledges financial support from the Polish Ministry of Science (grant nr 659 \n3653\/B\/P01\/2008\/35), NERC and EU Network of Excellence EVOLTREE (mobility 660 \ngrant).
