A new all-sky imaging Fabry-Perot spectrometer\nhas been installed at Mawson station (67\u25e636\u2032 S, 62\u25e652\u2032 E),\nAntarctica. This instrument is capable of recording indepen-\ndent spectra from many tens of locations across the sky si-\nmultaneously. Useful operation began in March 2007, with\nspectra recorded on a total of 186 nights. Initial analysis\nhas focused on the large-scale daily and average behavior\nof winds and temperatures derived from observations of the\n630.0 nm airglow line of atomic oxygen, originating from\na broad layer centered around 240 km altitude, in the iono-\nspheric F-region.\nThe 1993 Horizontal Wind Model (HWM93),\nNRLMSISE-00 atmospheric model, and the Coupled\nThermosphere\/Ionosphere Plasmasphere (CTIP) model\nwere used for comparison. During the geomagnetically\nquiet period studied, observed winds and temperatures were\ngenerally well modelled, although temperatures were consis-\ntently higher than NRLMSISE-00 predicted, by up to 100 K.\nCTIP temperatures better matched our data, particularly later\nin the night, but predicted zonal winds which were offset\nfrom those observed by 70\u2013180 ms\u22121 westward. During\nperiods of increased activity both winds and temperatures\nshowed much greater variability over time-scales of less\nthan an hour. For the active night presented here, a period\nof 45 min saw wind speeds decrease by around 180 ms\u22121,\nand temperatures increase by approximately 100 K. Active-\nperiod winds were poorly modelled by HWM93 and CTIP,\nalthough observed median temperatures were in better\nagreement with NRLMSISE-00 during such periods.\nAverage behavior was found to be generally consistent\nwith previous studies of thermospheric winds above Maw-\nson. The collected data set was representative of quiet geo-\nmagnetic and solar conditions. Geographic eastward winds\nCorrespondence to: C. Anderson\n(c.anderson@latrobe.edu.au)\nin the afternoon\/evening generally continued until around lo-\ncal midnight, when winds turned equatorward. Geographic\nmeridional and zonal winds in the afternoon were approxi-\nmately 50 ms\u22121 weaker than expected from HWM93, as was\nthe transition to equatorward flow around midnight. There\nwas also a negligible geographic zonal component to the\npost-midnight wind where HWM93 predicted strong west-\nward flow. Average temperatures between 19:00 and 04:00\nlocal solar time were around 60 K higher than predicted by\nNRLMSISE-00.\nKeywords. Atmospheric composition and structure (Air-\nglow and aurora) \u2013 Meteorology and atmospheric dynamics\n(Thermospheric dynamics; Instruments and techniques)\n1 Introduction\nLarge-scale thermospheric F-region winds are driven pre-\ndominantly by the pressure gradient which results from so-\nlar heating on the dayside, and momentum transfer from\nions convecting in the E\u00d7B direction due to electric fields\nmapped down from the magnetosphere. These driving forces\ntend to reinforce each other over the poles, forcing the neutral\nwind in the antisunward direction, while at auroral latitudes\nthe return (sunward) flow of ions tries to set up a two-cell\ncirculation of the neutral wind (Thayer and Killeen, 1993).\nRecently, evidence has been growing that structures exist\nin the thermospheric wind field at spatial scales of several\nhundred kilometers or less (Conde and Smith, 1998; Aru-\nliah and Griffin, 2001; Aruliah et al., 2004). Ongoing devel-\nopment of all-sky imaging Fabry-Perot spectrometers (Rees\nand Greenaway, 1983; Rees et al., 1984; Batten et al., 1988;\nSekar et al., 1993; Biondi et al., 1995; Griffin et al., 2008)\nhas resulted in instruments capable of recording independent\nspectra from many tens of locations across the sky simultane-\nously, making it possible to investigate this structure directly.\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n2226 C.

The\n630.0 nm line of atomic oxygen was observed, yielding esti-\nmates of conditions in the auroral F-region at a typical height\nof approximately 240 km. This instrument used a periscope\nto observe patches of the sky subtending around 1\u25e6 full-\nangle. The typical observing sequence directed the periscope\nat 60\u25e6 zenith angle in each of the four cardinal (NSEW) di-\nrections, and also in the zenith. A more advanced (higher-\nthroughput), narrow-field, single-etalon imaging instrument\nis currently in operation at Davis station (68\u25e635\u2032 S, 77\u25e658\u2032 E),\nsome 635 km east of Mawson (Davies et al., 2006). Measure-\nments of Doppler-shift from these periscope-equipped instru-\nments are typically averaged in the east-west and north-south\ndirections to generate zonal and meridional components of\nthe overhead wind field. The wind vectors thus derived are\nestimates of the \u201cbackground\u201d wind direction over a large\nspatial extent.\nA new all-sky imaging Fabry-Perot spectrometer was in-\nstalled at Mawson station during the 2006\/2007 summer, and\nbegan useful operation in March 2007. During the 2007 ob-\nserving season (March-October) the instrument observed the\n630.0 nm airglow line, and the data were used to derive F-\nregion winds and temperatures. These data are presented.\n2 Instrument description\nThe instrument used to obtain the data presented here is an\nall-sky imaging, separation-scanned Fabry-Perot spectrom-\neter, of the type described by Conde and Smith (1997). A\nschematic is shown in Fig. 1. It utilises an all-sky lens to\npass an approximately 75\u25e6 half-angle field-of-view of the sky\nthrough a large (150 mm) aperture, capacitance-stabilised\nFabry-Perot etalon. The gap between the etalon plates is\npiezoelectrically scannable over approximately 2.5 orders of\ninterference at \u03bb630.0 nm, about a nominal gap of 25 mm.\nTable 1 lists the key etalon properties, along with the focal\nlengths of lenses comprising the fore-optics. A six-position\nfilter-wheel within the fore-optics allows for selection of ob-\nserving wavelength. The wheel currently carries three inter-\nference filters, two for wavelengths of 630.0 nm and one for\n557.7 nm. Light from the etalon is angularly modulated by\napproximately 8 orders of interference fringes. A very fast,\n300 mm F\/2 Nikon lens images these fringes onto an Andor\n\u201cIxon\u201d electron-multiplying camera. The camera is thermo-\nelectrically cooled to \u221280\u25e6C and achieves greater than 90%\nquantum efficiency throughout most of the visible spectrum,\nwith very small read noise.\nCalibration light from up to four different sources can be\nintroduced directly beneath the filter-wheel via an integrating\nsphere. Two calibration sources were available during 2007,\nat wavelengths of 632.8 nm and 543.5 nm. Selection of the\ncalibration source is made possible by a servo-driven shut-\nter mechanism, controlled in software. A second software-\ncontrolled servo drives a small mirror used to switch the\nviewing direction between the sky and the calibration sphere.\nThe fringe-modulated image of the sky recorded by the\ncamera is subdivided by the analysis software into a number\nAnn.

Anderson et al.: Thermospheric winds and temperatures above Mawson 2227\nof \u201czones\u201d for the purpose of spectral accumulation, with\neach zone producing an individual spectrum, as shown in\nFig. 2 (lower panel). Spectra are recorded by repeatedly\nvarying (i.e., scanning) the etalon plate separation over one\norder of interference in N discrete steps; a single image\n(frame) is obtained from the camera at each step. For each\nimage, signal \u201ccounts\u201d from each pixel are appropriately\nsummed to produce spectra. That is, the software first de-\ntermines to which zone a pixel belongs, and then determines\nwhich spectral channel that pixel maps to at that point in the\nscan. As described by Conde and Smith (1998), the latter\ndetermination is based on both the position of the pixel and\non the current spacing of the plates. A scan over one in-\nterference order thus produces N individual camera frames,\nwith a typical integration time for each frame being 0.1 s.\nN is configurable; it was set to 128 for the observations re-\nported here. The total number of N-frame scans that must be\nsummed to produce a spectrum of adequate signal-to-noise\nratio in each zone depends of course on the prevailing emis-\nsion brightness. In operation, the signal-to-noise ratio of the\naccumulating spectra is dynamically monitored by the con-\ntrol software. The accumulation is continued either until the\nmedian signal-to-noise level across all zones reaches a pre-\ndetermined value, or until a set maximum time elapses. This\nprocess of co-adding spectra over multiple scans comprises\nwhat we refer to as one \u201cexposure\u201d. For the observations de-\nscribed here the overall integration times per exposure varied\nfrom approximately 2 min during active aurora to as much as\n15 min during very quiet conditions.\n3 Data analysis\nGeophysical parameters are derived by fitting to each\nrecorded spectrum a model (Gaussian) emission spectrum\nconvolved with a previously measured instrument function,\nusing the method described by Conde (2001). In apply-\ning this algorithm to passive Fabry-Perot spectra, aerosol\nbackscatter is excluded from the model spectrum, and re-\nturned temperatures are appropriate to passively acquired\nspectra (in contrast to lidar backscatter spectra, which are\nDoppler broadened by twice the amount of passive spec-\ntra). Estimates of peak wavelength, Doppler temperature,\nemission and background intensity are obtained from these\nfits. Calibration spectra are acquired by observing light\nfrom a frequency-stabilised He-Ne laser (\u03bb632.8 nm). The\nfrequency with which these spectra are acquired is config-\nurable; for the data presented here a single calibration expo-\nsure was recorded after every five airglow exposures. Cali-\nbration spectra are used to measure the instrument function,\nwhile the peak wavelengths returned from fits to these spec-\ntra are used to correct derived winds for instrumental drift,\nwhich rarely exceeds an overall excursion of around 15 ms\u22121\nduring the night. The frequency drift of the laser is reported\nby the manufacturer (for a similar laser in use at Davis sta-\n901 1000Temperature (K)\n       \n       \n       \n              \n       \n              \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n              \n       \n       \n       \n       \n              \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n              \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n              \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n              \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n              \n       \n       \n       \n       \nFig. 2.

Magnetic\nnorth is at the top of these images, east is to the right.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/2225\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 2225\u20132235, 2009\n2228 C. Anderson et al.: Thermospheric winds and temperatures above Mawson\ntion) to be \u00b10.3 MHz in one hour. The corresponding wave-\nlength drift is approximately 5\u00d710\u22125 of the etalon free spec-\ntral range, which is negligible.\nFor the data presented here the field-of-view was divided\ninto 61 zones. At 240 km altitude, where the peak of the\n630.0 nm airglow emission occurs, the radial field-of-view of\nthe instrument is approximately 740 km. The horizontal (ra-\ndial) extent of a zone projected onto the sky at this altitude\ndepends on radial distance from the center of the field-of-\nview, and varies here from approximately 55 km for zones\nin the first annulus out from the center, to 320 km for the\noutermost annulus. A zero-velocity reference is obtained by\nassuming an average vertical wind speed of 0 ms\u22121 through-\nout the night. Although this assumption is likely not valid for\nshorter periods of observation, the errors introduced by this\nassumption are at most around 20 ms\u22121 (Aruliah and Rees,\n1995), and likely much less. Vertical wind is recorded in\nthe central zone, and line-of-sight winds are calculated by\ncomparing peak wavelength time-series for each zone to the\nzero-velocity reference.\nHaving reduced the spectral data to time series of zone-\ndependent peak-position, temperature, background and in-\ntensity, a second level of analysis is used to fit a horizontal\nvector wind field to the subset of line-of-sight peak-positions\nwhich comprise each exposure. See Conde and Smith (1998)\nfor a detailed discussion of this vector fitting method. The\nvector fit describes the two-dimensional wind field as a su-\nperposition of uniform wind terms (mean meridional and\nzonal winds, calculated separately in each annulus) and the\ngradients of these winds in each of the meridional and zonal\ndirections. The latter can only be determined in annuli con-\ntaining \u22656 zones, and are averaged over all such annuli to\nproduce a single all-sky mean value for each gradient term.\nThe final vector components for each zone are then obtained\nfrom the uniform wind terms (calculated separately within\neach annulus) and the gradient terms averaged over the field-\nof-view. The central zone, which does not contribute to the\nvector fit, is used to hold the median values of each wind\ncomponent returned by the fitting algorithm. When plotted,\nthe central zone thus shows the average wind direction and\nmagnitude across all zones for each exposure. Note that only\nthe horizontal wind field is fitted in this way; temperatures\nand intensities are returned by the spectral fitting algorithm\nindependently for each zone.\nFor every channel in a scan the camera records a\nmonochromatic, fringe-modulated image of the sky at the\nwavelength of observation. The superposition of all such im-\nages in a single scan allows the instrument to build up a nor-\nmal 512\u00d7512 pixel sky image after each scan is completed.\nThe final sky image obtained from an overall exposure (com-\nprised of multiple scans) is the sum of all these single-scan\nsky images. An example all-sky image, with the correspond-\ning fitted vector wind field superimposed on it, is shown in\nFig. 2 (upper panel), along with the recorded sky spectra,\ninstrument profiles and temperature estimates (lower panel).\nImportantly, these images are obtained at the same wave-\nlength as the corresponding wind and temperature estimates,\nover identical fields of view and identical integration periods.\nThe analysis to this point is useful for examining the day-\nto-day variability of the thermospheric wind and temperature\nfield. However in order to investigate the average behavior\nof these winds and temperatures, also known as a superposed\nepoch analysis, a third level of analysis is required. For each\nexposure, median values of the fitted meridional and zonal\nwind (i.e. the average wind components stored in the cen-\ntral zone) and temperature are calculated to produce a single\nall-sky average value for these parameters in each exposure.\nCorresponding to these observed (average) values, model es-\ntimates of wind and temperature are produced for each ex-\nposure using HWM93 and NRLMSISE-00 respectively, as\ndescribed in Sect. 3.2. A single estimate of zonal and merid-\nional wind, plus temperature, is produced for each exposure,\nusing the geomagnetic and solar conditions prevailing at the\ntime the exposure was made. Exposures are then sorted by\ngeomagnetic and solar activity (parameterised here by the Ap\nand F10.7 indices respectively) and cloud level. The all-sky\nmedian values from those exposures which meet the selec-\ntion criteria (in this case ranges of activity and cloud levels)\nare then sorted into time bins of configurable width. The me-\ndian of each time bin then represents the average value of\na certain parameter (including both observed and modelled\nwinds and temperatures) occurring within a particular time\ninterval and under the given geomagnetic and solar condi-\ntions.\n3.1 Offset correction\nCloud appearing in the instrument\u2019s field-of-view can affect\nline-of-sight velocity estimates, as cloud can scatter the opti-\ncal signal both into and out of the line-of-sight direction. If\nthe unscattered component of the brightness in a particular\ndirection is low compared to much brighter regions in other\nparts of the sky, the net signal seen when viewing the cloud\nmay include a significant or even dominant contribution from\ndirections other than the original line-of-sight. This essen-\ntially produces an intensity-weighted spatial average over a\nregion of the sky that extends beyond the original viewing\nzone. Depending on the angular distribution of emission\nbrightness and Doppler-shift across the sky, such scattering\ncan shift the apparent wavelength seen when viewing cloud,\nrelative to that which would be seen when viewing the sky di-\nrectly. In the case of very heavy cloud, the averaging occurs\nacross the whole sky, and is so complete that the line-of-sight\nvelocity measured by all zones will approach zero.\nHowever, exposures recorded by the Mawson instrument\nduring such periods of very heavy cloud (covering the entire\nfield-of-view) show non-zero line-of-sight velocities whose\nmagnitude varies with azimuth around the detector, consis-\ntent with a constant, non-zero offset aligned along the de-\ntector\u2019s top-bottom axis.

In correcting this offset, an average\nline-of-sight wind velocity was obtained for each zone during\n12 days which had very heavy cloud cover (time averaging\nover 12 days should further suppress any angular variation of\nDoppler-shift over the actual sky). These line-of-sight veloc-\nities were then subtracted from each exposure before fitting\nthe vector wind field. This offset is clearly present and repro-\nducible across multiple calibrations. While the exact mech-\nanism responsible for it is currently unclear, we have indi-\ncations from both this instrument and from a similar one in\nAlaska that it is related to the way charge was read out from\nthe camera\u2019s CCD chip. Results from a (currently unpub-\nlished) study into vertical winds using both the Mawson and\nDavis spectrometers have confirmed the need for this offset\ncorrection.\n3.2 Empirical and numerical models\nThree atmospheric models were used for comparison in this\nstudy. The 1993 Horizontal Wind Model (HWM93) (Hedin\net al., 1988, 1991) is an empirical model of the horizontal\nneutral wind in the upper atmosphere. Inputs include alti-\ntude, latitude, longitude, time, solar radio flux (F10.7) and\nmagnetic activity (Ap) index. NRLMSISE-00 (Picone et al.,\n2002) is an empirical model which outputs neutral tempera-\nture and density from ground to thermospheric heights. In-\nputs are almost identical to HWM93. The Coupled Thermo-\nsphere\/Ionosphere Plasmasphere (CTIP v1.0) model (Fuller-\nRowell et al., 1996; Millward et al., 1996) solves the time-\ndependent, coupled equations of momentum, energy and\ncontinuity to calculate the temperature, density and veloc-\nity of the neutral atmosphere, as well as ion temperatures and\ndensities over selected height ranges. Inputs to this model in-\nclude fixed or time-dependent values of Hemispheric Power,\nHemispheric Power Index, solar radio flux (F10.7) and solar\nwind parameters.\n4 Results\nWinds and temperatures derived from observations of the\n630.0 nm airglow line of atomic oxygen are presented in\ntwo parts. First, two examples of individual nights of ob-\nservation are presented, to highlight the day-to-day variabil-\nity and the contrast between geomagnetically quiet and ac-\ntive conditions. Comparisons are made with the models de-\nscribed in Sect. 3.2, where the inputs to all three models were\nconstant (i.e. time-independent), and represented the mean\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/2225\/2009\/ Ann.

While geomagnetic activity was\nquite variable (though low) for this data set, solar activity\nremained consistently low during these solar minimum con-\nditions.\n4.1 Daily variability\nData from two nights of observation, 20 April and 23 May\n2007, will be discussed in detail. These nights will be re-\nferred to as nights A and B, respectively. Geomagnetic con-\nditions and the Bz component of the IMF for the three days\ncentered on each of these nights are shown in Fig. 3. Night A\nwas a time of very low activity. Ap reached a maximum of\n12 the previous day, and for the rest of the 3 day period was\ngenerally less than 5. Dst and IMF Bz also show minimal\ndisturbance. Night B was conversely a period of relatively\nactive geomagnetic conditions, with a rising trend in Ap (be-\nginning around 12:00 UT the previous day) accompanied by\nstrongly negative Dst and southward IMF.\nAnn.

Histograms of line-of-sight wind and temperature uncertainties for nights A and B, across all zones.\nFigure 4 shows the observed winds and temperatures for\nnights A and B.

Winds output\nby HWM93 (solid green line) and CTIP (dashed blue line),\nas well as temperatures from CTIP (dashed orange line) and\nNRLMSISE-00 (solid red line) are shown. As mentioned\npreviously, inputs for all three models were constant through-\nout the observing periods, and were representative of the\nmean prevailing conditions. The effect of increased signal\nlevel on exposure times can be seen in the decreased tempo-\nral spacing of data points on night B compared to night A.\nFigure 5 shows histograms of the 1-\u03c3 line-of-sight wind\nand temperature uncertainties for each night, across all\nzones. These are the statistical uncertainties in the absolute\nvalues of the line-of-sight winds and temperatures returned\nby the spectral fitting algorithm, and give a good indication\nof instrumental performance. Typical uncertainty in fitted\nline-of-sight wind speed is around 10 ms\u22121, while tempera-\nture uncertainty is usually less than 45 K.\nNight A was a good example of what is often seen at\nMawson. Wind flow was (geographically) antisunward in the\nevening, and remained eastward for most of the night. The\nwind became predominantly northward around 2 h after lo-\ncal midnight. Meridional winds were reasonably well mod-\nelled by both HWM93 and CTIP, however CTIP predicted\nzonal winds which were offset from those observed by 70\u2013\n180 ms\u22121 westward. Temperatures were between 50\u2013100 K\nhigher than those predicted by NRLMSISE-00, but followed\nthe same trend, decreasing smoothly from 800 K at the start\nof the night to a minimum of 680 K around local midnight,\nbefore once again increasing to approximately 750 K at the\nend of the night (6am local solar time). CTIP temperatures\nwere in much closer agreement with those observed, partic-\nularly towards the end of the night. Discrepancies between\nobserved and modelled temperatures are unlikely to be due\nto any instrumental effects since the instrument function is\nmuch narrower than the emission spectrum.\nWinds on night B were poorly modelled by both HWM93\nand CTIP. Afternoon\/evening sector winds showed strong\n(up to 300 ms\u22121) flow southward across the geographic pole.\nAt Mawson this translates to a wind aligned strongly with\ngeomagnetic west, following the plasma convection. Equa-\ntorward flow was seen around 2 h after local midnight, after\nwhich time the observatory passed beneath a region of weak,\nvariable zonal wind. Meridional winds predicted by HWM93\nand CTIP for this night both had the correct morphology\nwith time, however both were offset by around 70\u2013100 ms\u22121\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/2225\/2009\/ Ann.

Both models predicted\na similar trend in the zonal wind (with CTIP offset from\nHWM93 by 100\u2013200 ms\u22121 westward), which was in poor\nagreement with observation.\nMedian temperature on this night was around 200 K higher\nthan night A, and showed much more variability during the\nnight. These fluctuations were not reproduced by either\nNRLMSISE-00 or CTIP, however temperatures predicted by\nNRLMSISE-00 better matched our data on this night than did\nthose predicted by CTIP. Temperature fluctuations as large\nas 100 K were seen to occur over a relatively short time (ap-\nproximately 45 min). These fluctuations were likely due to a\ncombination of actual heating (both Joule and particle heat-\ning) and a changing height profile of the 630.0 nm emission\nin response to variations in the energy spectrum of the au-\nroral precipitation. The minimum (median) temperature of\n830 K occurred around 1 a.m. local solar time.\n4.2 Average daily behavior\nFigure 6 shows the results of the superposed epoch analysis\noutlined in Sect. 3, where the epoch is in this case 24 h of\nlocal time. For this analysis all exposures recorded when\ncloud levels were \u2264 38 (a total of 80 nights) were binned\ninto approximately 20 min time intervals, and the median\nvalue within each time bin obtained. Error bars show the\n1-\u03c3 widths of the observed distributions within each time\nbin.

As described in Sect. 3, model\nvalues are calculated for every exposure in the data set, and\naveraged in the same way as observed winds and tempera-\ntures. Each time bin then contains, along with the average\nof the observed wind components and temperatures, the av-\nerage of the returned model estimates corresponding to each\nof these parameters, for the geomagnetic and solar activity\nAnn.

The small map underneath shows the geographic north and compass north directions, relative to the Mawson coastline, as\nwell as the orientation of the auroral oval relative to these directions.\nprevailing at the time those observations were made. Alter-\nnative model averaging schemes were tested, and found to\nhave only minor impact on the resulting average model time-\nseries. It is for example possible to use the mean value of\nAp and F10.7 within each time bin as input to the models,\nor to use only a single March\u2013October average for each of\nthese inputs, over the entire epoch. We believe the current\nscheme best represents the average model results, despite the\nfact that some small discontinuities remain when these re-\nsults are viewed as an average time-series.\nThe data set from which these averages were calculated\ncontained very few geomagnetically active days. Of those\nobservations which were made when cloud was \u2264 38 , 84%\nwere made during periods when Ap was \u226420. Solar activity\nwas also very low, as F10.7 showed minimal variation around\na median of 71\u00d710\u221222 J s\u22121 m\u22122 Hz\u22121. Thus the data set is\nheavily biased towards a geomagnetically quiet day under so-\nlar minimum conditions. The contribution to any given time\nbin from observations made under active geomagnetic condi-\ntions has been shown to be minimal by comparing Fig. 6 with\none produced by observations which were limited to those\nmade when Ap was \u226410 (not shown). For the majority of\nthe night, the difference is less than 20 ms\u22121 for wind speeds\nand 30 K for temperatures. These values are small compared\nwith the 1-\u03c3 widths within each time bin, and would have\nvery little impact on the following discussion.\nFigure 7a presents the data of Fig. 6 in a dial-type plot.\nObservations have been interpolated to show 50 wind vec-\ntors between the earliest and latest times for which there\nis data available. Here wind vectors are plotted from the\nperspective of an observer looking down on the geographic\nsouth pole (shown in the figure as a cross), from a point in\nspace above the pole. The geographic southward direction\ntherefore points radially inward at all times, while the east-\nward direction is clockwise around the dial. Local solar time\n(approximately 4 h ahead of universal time at Mawson) in-\ncreases clockwise around the dial, and the sun is to the top of\nthe figure. Wind vectors predicted by HWM93 are shown in\nblue.\nThe general trend seen above Mawson was for antisun-\nward (geographic eastward) winds in the afternoon\/evening\nsector. From approximately 21:00 local solar time wind\nspeeds were much reduced, and remained low until the tran-\nsition to geographic northward flow occurred approximately\n2 h after local midnight. After this transition, geographic\nmeridional wind speeds were often relatively slow, around\n50\u201380 ms\u22121. Agreement between observed and modelled\nwinds was reasonable except for the lack of a strong west-\nward zonal wind in the morning sector expected by HWM93.\nAlso the transition to equatorward flow around this time of-\nten exhibited slower meridional wind speeds than was pre-\ndicted by the model. It should be noted that a large amount\nof data contributing to the empirical HWM93 were recorded\nduring solar maximum conditions, which may account for\nsome of the discrepancies between observed and modelled\nwinds, particularly with regard to wind speed.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/2225\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 2225\u20132235, 2009\n2234 C. Anderson et al.: Thermospheric winds and temperatures above Mawson\nThe average winds presented here are similar to those\nfound in comparable studies of thermospheric winds above\nMawson, see for example Conde and Dyson (1995a). How-\never, in this earlier study, strong (100\u2013200 ms\u22121) average\nwinds were observed flowing geomagnetically equatorward\nafter 02:50 local solar time (magnetic midnight), whereas the\naverage data presented here show very weak flow in this time\nsector, directed magnetically eastward. These authors also\nobserved predominantly magnetic zonal flow between 21:50\nand 00:50 local solar time, whereas the present study shows\na stronger magnetic poleward component in this period. The\nstudy cited was carried out during the downward phase of so-\nlar cycle 22, under conditions of greater solar activity, which\nmay account for some of these differences.\nSince the average winds shown in Fig. 7a are represen-\ntative of a geomagnetically quiet night, Fig. 7b is given to\nillustrate the effect that increased geomagnetic disturbance\nhas on observed winds. This dial-plot is in the same format\nas Fig. 7a, and shows the wind vectors observed on night B\n(Sect. 4.1), during which time levels of geomagnetic activity\nwere relatively high (see Fig. 3).\nThe most noticeable feature of the wind on this night is the\nstrong geographic poleward component in the afternoon and\nevening, which was present at reduced magnitude until local\nmidnight. Since geomagnetic north at Mawson is approxi-\nmately 66\u25e6 west of true north, this poleward wind is directed\napproximately sunward in a geomagnetic coordinate system,\nfollowing the plasma convection. Wind speeds are much\nstronger throughout this period than predicted by HWM93.\nAverage temperatures show better agreement with\nNRLMSISE-00 at the beginning and end of the observation\nperiod. For the 9 h or so between 15:00 and 24:00 UT tem-\nperatures were often around 60 K higher than predicted by\nthe model, similar to the quiet night (night A) presented in\nSect. 4.1. Since NRLMSISE-00 relies on experimental data\ninput, this disagreement between the average observed tem-\nperatures and model temperatures is possibly due to a lack\nof data coverage in the model above Mawson at these times,\nand under quiet geomagnetic conditions. Agreement with\nthe model generally improved with increasing geomagnetic\nactivity. Mean temperature was approximately 790 K.\n5 Conclusions\nData from the first season of operation of the Mawson\nall-sky imaging Fabry-Perot spectrometer have been pre-\nsented. Initial analysis has focused on the behaviour of\nwinds and temperatures across the entire field-of-view of\nthe instrument. For geomagnetically quiet nights the large-\nscale winds followed reasonably well the trends predicted\nby HWM93 and CTIP, although CTIP predicted zonal winds\nwhich were offset by 70\u2013180 ms\u22121 westward from those ob-\nserved. Temperatures were well modelled by CTIP, but were\noften higher than those predicted by NRLMSISE-00, by ap-\nproximately 100 K. On nights of above average geomagnetic\nactivity however the meridional and zonal components of the\nwind field can show much greater departures from modelled\nwinds, and much greater variability over shorter time-scales.\nThese departures are not surprising considering the highly\nvariable nature of energy inputs to the auroral thermosphere\n(see for example Kosch et al., 2000). For the active night pre-\nsented here, median temperatures were up to 200 K higher,\nand showed large (up to 100 K) short-lived variations.\nAverage behavior was characterised by antisunward winds\nin the late afternoon which continued into the pre-midnight\nsector at a reduced magnitude, with northward flow occur-\nring around 2 h after local midnight. Wind speeds were gen-\nerally lower than expected, which may be attributable to deep\nsolar minimum conditions as mentioned previously. Tem-\nperatures followed the trend expected by NRLMSISE-00, al-\nthough they were higher by around 60 K during the middle\nof the observation period.\nWhile initial analysis has focused on the large-scale daily\nand average behaviour of winds and temperatures, an imag-\ning instrument such as the one employed here is ideally\nsuited to the observation of small-scale structures. Figure 2\nshows an example of such structure, in this case divergence\nin the wind field. This figure also shows an approximately\n100 K temperature variation in the vicinity of an auroral arc,\nanother feature which is commonly observed. This small-\nscale structure will be the focus of future study.\nAcknowledgements.
