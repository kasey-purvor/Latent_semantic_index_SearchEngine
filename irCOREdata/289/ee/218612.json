Recently,\nactions aimed at leveraging and securing firm\nresources have been intensively studied. Actions\nwere measured against their ability to make a\nresource valuable, rare, and\/or inimitable (Bar-\nney, 1991). Human capital is often considered a\npotential firm resource (Pfeffer, 1994; Koch and\nMcGrath, 1996; Conner and Prahalad, 1996; Lee\nand Miller, 1999), sparking intense interest among\nstrategy scholars in the performance effects of\nKeywords: Work-life balance; family-friendly work prac-\ntices; nonmarket strategies; firm performance; manage-\nment practices; resource-based view\n*Correspondence to: Tobias Kretschmer, University of Munich,\nDepartment of Management, Schackstr. 4\/III, D\u201480539\nMunich, Germany.

Similarly, providing long-term financial incentives\naligns executives\u2019 incentives with shareholder goals, both of\nwhich will help a firm get the most out of its employees (raising\nV). Conversely, giving employees the option to scale down their\nworking hours, or offering childcare support within the firm, can\nhelp a firm in retaining valuable employees (increasing I) without\nnecessarily increasing their productivity.\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors.

Bloom, T. Kretschmer, and J. Van Reenen\nwhich led scholars to widen the definition of firm\nperformance to include corporate social perfor-\nmance (Brammer and Millington, 2008; David,\nBloom, and Hillman, 2007) or environmental\nresponse (Murillo-Luna, Garce\u00b4s-Ayerbe, and\nRivera-Torres, 2008), and to consider antecedents\nof actions affecting other performance dimensions\n(Young, Charns, and Shortell, 2001; Murillo-Luna\net al., 2008; Coombs and Gilley, 2005). Generally\nspeaking, the link between nonfinancial stake-\nholder demands and firm actions suggests that\nfirms consider multiple factors when choosing their\nactions. From a strategic perspective, what is espe-\ncially interesting is whether actions influenced by\nnonfinancial stakeholders are detrimental to firm\nfinancial performance (i.e., if they are inconsis-\ntent with firms maximizing profits), or whether\nthey complement other policies in making firm\nresources valuable, rare, and inimitable.\nThe management of human capital plays a cru-\ncial role in this line of research (Conner and Pra-\nhalad, 1996). On the one hand, the link between\nemployees and performance seems obvious, but\nmany strategies designed to improve workforce\nproductivity are only expected to translate into\n\u2018hard\u2019 performance measures like firm value\n(Perry-Smith and Blum, 2000; Arthur, 2003;\nDelaney and Huselid, 1996; Edmans, 2007) or\naccounting profits (Huselid, 1995; Huselid, Jack-\nson, and Schuler, 1997) through \u2018soft\u2019 channels\nlike organizational commitment (Lee and Miller,\n1999; Eaton, 2003) or employee turnover (Guthrie,\n2001; Huselid, 1995). On the other hand, the rea-\nsons for implementing certain employee-friendly\npractices are not clear-cut, as employees are an\ninput factor as well as a stakeholder group. This\nis especially salient for family-friendly workplace\npractices (FFWP), which do not directly affect\nthe workplace, but rather enhance the ability of\nemployees to combine working and personal life.\nNevertheless, prior work looking at the association\nbetween FFWP and firm performance (Perry-Smith\nand Bloom, 2000; Gray and Tudball, 2003; Mil-\nliken, Martins, and Morgan, 1998) has generally\nfound a positive association whether performance\nwas measured in terms of work attitudes (Kossek\nand Ozeki, 1998; Lobel, 1999; Van Yperen and\nHagedoorn, 2003), organizational citizenship\n(Organ and Konovsky, 1989; Schnake, 1991;\nSmith, Organ, and Near, 1983), or even firm\nproductivity (Konrad and Mangel, 2000; George,\n2005; Collins and Clark, 2003).\nThe positive link between FFWP and perfor-\nmance may be problematic for several reasons.\nFirst, FFWP may simply be part of a wider set\nof management practices found in well-performing\nfirms. If a well-managed firm uses a number\nof performance-enhancing management practices\nand concurrently uses FFWP, omitting the set of\nother practices in performance regressions cre-\nates a spurious correlation between FFWP and\nperformance, a so-called \u2018false positive.\u20192 Second,\nwhile the provision of FFWP may improve morale\nand employee retention, the link between FFWP\nand a set of hard performance measures is more\ncontroversial and has to be studied rigorously. For\nexample, employee retention may improve after\nFFWP are introduced, but there may be costs\nof production inflexibility reducing productivity\nor costs of implementation reducing profitability.\nThird, the FFWP-performance link may not give\na conclusive picture because firms may provide\nFFWP for reasons other than enhancing finan-\ncial performance. FFWP provision may be due to\nfirm characteristics unrelated to firm performance,\nwhich would be ignored in a narrowly defined\nstudy on FFWP and performance.\nFurther, a positive overall assessment of FFWP,\nif confirmed, would leave us with a puzzle: if\nFFWP were unambiguously good for firm perfor-\nmance, all firms should introduce them on their\nown accord (which they do not). One potential\nexplanation is that FFWP carry significant costs\nof implementation borne by the firms while the\nreturns accrue to both firms and workers, which\ncreates a divergence of private and public returns\nand the resulting underinvestment (or underprovi-\nsion) problem. Another explanation is that firms\ndo not know the extent of benefits of FFWP, and\ntherefore prefer to delay introducing them until\nthey know more about them (Bryson et al., 2007).\nA third is that firms have differing benefits from\nFFWP and therefore some choose to adopt them,\nwhile it is not profitable for others to do so due to\ntheir employee base (Konrad and Mangel, 2000;\nGray and Tudball, 2003) or their strategy (De Cieri\net al., 2005; Becker, Huselid, and Ulrich, 1996). A\nfourth possible reason for this puzzle is that firms\nhave different preferences regarding the balance of\n2 Carmeli and Tishler (2004) show that including intangible orga-\nnizational characteristics in performance regressions can help\nexplain considerable performance differences between\norganizations.\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors.

This weighting is influenced\nboth by internal and external circumstances of the\nfirm (Perry-Smith and Blum, 2000; Brammer and\nMillington, 2008).\nThere has been little or no research that distin-\nguishes among these factors and gives an expla-\nnation for the differential use of FFWP. In this\npaper, we study two connected aspects related to\nthe strategic use of FFWP. First, we investigate the\n\u2018effect\u2019 of FFWP on firm performance measured\nin multiple ways while controlling for multiple\nfactors, including the quality of management prac-\ntices (Bloom and Van Reenen, 2007, 2010b).3 This\nimposes more stringent conditions on identifying\nFFWP as a bundle of activities constituting a firm\nresource (Koch and McGrath, 1996; Perry-Smith\nand Blum, 2000). Second, we study \u2018determinants\u2019\nof FFWP. That is, we look for differences in firm\ncharacteristics and external circumstances affect-\ning firms\u2019 propensity to implement FFWP (Konrad\nand Mangel, 2000; Perry-Smith and Blum, 2000).\nSpecifically, we ask two key questions:\ni) Are FFWP positively correlated to firm perfor-\nmance?\nii) Which firms are likely to adopt FFWP?\nThe first question studies the FFWP-firm per-\nformance link. While the direction of causality\nis difficult to establish in cross-sectional data, we\nsubject the claim of a positive correlation between\nFFWP and firm performance to a rigorous analysis,\nrunning a large number of robustness tests with dif-\nferent measures of our dependent and independent\nvariables. In particular, we control for the quality\nof management practices, thus presenting a more\nrigorous test of FFWP as a firm resource (Arend,\n2006). The strategic implications of a possible\npositive FFWP-performance link are clear: firms\nwill have to offer FFWP on top of other favor-\nable management practices if they want to improve\nperformance. The second question addresses the\napparent puzzle that if FFWP are a universally\ndesirable policy, why do not all firms adopt them?\nWe study a set of firm characteristics that may\naffect the propensity of adopting such practices,\neither because FFWP are in higher demand or\n3 Note that we will use \u2018performance\u2019 to indicate a firm\u2019s\nfinancial performance unless noted otherwise.\nbecause they are cheaper to provide in firms with\ncertain characteristics.\nUsing a novel survey tool on the provision\nof FFWP as well as management practices and\nmatching this data with detailed information on\nfirm financial performance, we address two com-\nmon problems in testing for firm resources (Arend,\n2006; Newbert, 2007): first, the confirmatory bias\narising from omitting other performance-enhancing\nresources, and second, the problems associated\nwith using narrow performance measures. We thus\nbelieve that our study gives a nuanced picture of\nthe provision and impact of FFWP and its validity\nas a firm resource.\nWe surveyed over 450 firms in Europe (Ger-\nmany, France, and the United Kingdom) and\nthe United States to gather data on firm perfor-\nmance, management, and FFWP, and uncovered\na number of surprising results. First, we found\nthat, contrary to much of the existing literature\non FFWP, the positive association between firm\nperformance and FFWP disappears once controls\nfor management practices are included. This sug-\ngests that some of the earlier results on the pos-\nitive performance impact of FFWP (Batt, 2002;\nFey et al., 2000; Perry-Smith and Blum, 2000;\nGray and Tudball, 2003; Milliken et al., 1998)\nmay be due in part to omitted variable bias, as\nthese studies do not control adequately for man-\nagement quality. This calls for recasting FFWP\nas a nonmarket strategy affecting outcomes other\nthan financial performance. Second, we find that\n\u2018external\u2019 factors like the gender and skills com-\nposition of the workforce and the overall quality\nof management play an important role in FFWP\nprovision.\nOur paper is structured as follows: in the next\nsection, we introduce a general framework for\nthe provision of FFWP and their impact on firm\nperformance. We then derive testable hypotheses\non the impact and determinants of FFWP before\nwe give a detailed discussion of our dataset and\nthe procedures used to collect it. We subsequently\npresent and discuss our results, and finally provide\nconcluding comments.\nA GENERAL FRAMEWORK\nAlthough FFWP are often considered part of high-\nperformance HR strategy and good management in\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors.

To conceptualize this,\nwe separate FFWP and a set of \u2018good\u2019 manage-\nment practices shown to improve firm productivity.\nConsider a simple approach of characterizing the\neffects of good management and FFWP:\nw = f (X,M,D) (1)\ny = g(X,M,D) (2)\nwhere w = work-life balance outcomes and y =\nperformance outcomes (such as productivity or\nprofitability). X is an index of FFWP (such as\nchild\/family care flexibility and subsidy\u2014a com-\nplete list is given in Table 1a), and M is an\nindex of good management practices (such as bet-\nter shop floor operations like lean manufacturing,\nsensible targets, and merit-based promotion pro-\ncedures\u2014see the section on scoring FFWP and\nmanagement practices below). We model these\nas being composite measures of several underly-\ning practices, so that X = x(X1 , X2 , X3 , . . .) and\nM = m(M1 ,M2 ,M3 , . . .), where X1 , X2 , X3 . . .\nare FFWP and M1 ,M2 ,M3 . . . are different\nmanagement \u2018best practices.\u2019 The x(.) and m(.)\nare non-decreasing functions of the arguments.\nFinally, D is a vector of control variables. Note\nthat we consider work-life balance an \u2018outcome\u2019\nand FFWP an \u2018input.\u2019\nWe expect better management practices to be\nassociated with better performance: \u2202y\/\u2202M \u2265 0 .\nWe also expect more available family-friendly\npolicies to be associated with improved work-life\nbalance outcomes, that is, \u2202w\/\u2202X \u2265 0 (Kossek\nand Ozeki, 1998; Lobel, 1999; Van Yperen and\nHagedoorn, 2003; Organ and Konovsky, 1989;\nSchnake, 1991; Smith et al., 1983).

If FFWP\nare implemented predominantly to improve work-\ners\u2019 well-being rather than to improve firm perfor-\nmance, we expect \u2202y\/\u2202X \u2264 0 , so that there is no\npositive association between more FFWP provided\nby the firm and superior performance. Firms may\nthen still implement FFWP because \u2202w\/\u2202X \u2265 0\n(i.e., more FFWP imply better work-life balance)\nand they care about workers\u2019 well-being as well\nas financial performance. This could be due to the\nfirm owners\u2019 preferences, labor unions, or because\nof regulatory pressures. If FFWP help make human\ncapital a more valuable or more inimitable firm\nresource by helping employees work more pro-\nductively or help the firm retain talented staff, we\nexpect \u2202y\/\u2202X \u2265 0 , that is, better FFWP are posi-\ntively correlated with performance.4\nWe also consider the drivers of FFWP provision.\nConsider a set of factors Z = (Z1 , Z2 , Z3 , . . .) that\nmay affect these practices. These factors can be\ninternal or external to the firm and may proxy for\npressure by nonfinancial stakeholders to implement\ncertain organizational strategies such as FFWP.\nWe therefore model FFWP as a function of these\nfactors:\nX = h(Z,D) (3)\nEspecially in the context of internal factors and\ncharacteristics, this allows for a simple test if\nFFWP provision is used to increase the value of a\nresource: if an interaction term between X (FFWP)\nand a factor Zi (say, the proportion of skilled\nemployees) is positive in Equation (2), this would\nindicate that Zi is a valuable resource that is made\nmore effective by providing favorable FFWP. We\ninvestigate this in more detail when we discuss our\nregression results.\nThis framework is useful for a number of rea-\nsons. First, we can separate the effects of firm and\nenvironmental characteristics on FFWP and per-\nformance. Second, we can draw some conclusions\nabout why firms provide FFWP. If there is a nega-\ntive, or zero, correlation between FFWP provision\nand firm performance, FFWP may be provided\nbecause firms take other factors (like employee\n4 Note, however, that a simple positive relationship does not\nimply that FFWP are a valuable, rare, and inimitable firm\nresource. To confirm this, a more stringent test would be required\n(Arend, 2006; Newbert, 2007).\nwell-being or corporate social responsibility) into\naccount or because firm characteristics or circum-\nstances dictate the implementation of FFWP.\nIn the following section, we derive hypotheses\non the correlation between FFWP and performance\n(Hypothesis 1) and on the determinants of FFWP\n(Hypotheses 2\u20135).\nHYPOTHESES\nUncovering the FFWP-performance link\nWe first derive our hypothesis on the link between\nFFWP and firm performance. The management of\nhuman capital and its link to firm performance\nhas generated significant academic interest (Con-\nner and Prahalad, 1996). SHRM more generally\n(Cappelli and Singh, 1992; Pfeffer, 1994; Ulrich,\n1991; Wright and McMahan, 1992; Huselid, 1995)\nand high-commitment workplace practices specif-\nically have been studied in much detail (Perry-\nSmith and Blum, 2000; Arthur, 2003; Delaney\nand Huselid, 1996; Huselid, 1995; Huselid et al.,\n1997; Lee and Miller, 1999; Eaton, 2003; Guthrie,\n2001), and a subset of these looks at the impact\nof family-friendly policies on firm performance\n(Perry-Smith and Blum, 2000; Gray and Tudball,\n2003; Milliken et al., 1998). Using a number of\ndifferent performance measures such as work atti-\ntudes (Kossek and Ozeki, 1998; Lobel, 1999; Van\nYperen and Hagedoorn, 2003), organizational cit-\nizenship (Organ and Konovsky, 1989; Schnake,\n1991; Smith et al., 1983), and firm productivity\n(George, 2005; Collins and Clark, 2003), the liter-\nature is united in their view that FFWP positively\naffect firm performance, which is summarized in\nour first hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1: There is a positive association\nbetween more FFWP and firm performance.\nTo accurately capture the performance effects\nof FFWP, however, we have to control for fac-\ntors that may be correlated both with FFWP and\nperformance and may therefore generate spurious\ncorrelation if omitted. To avoid this problem and\nfollowing Equation (2), we include a set of man-\nagement practices that have previously been shown\nto be positively correlated with firm performance.\nWe outline this approach in more detail when we\ndiscuss our results.\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors.

Van Reenen\nDeterminants of FFWP provision\nIn the following four hypotheses, we identify a\nnumber of covariates Z1 , Z2 , Z3 . . . in\nEquation (3).\nWorkers\u2019 skill levels\nThe literature on SHRM emphasizes the impor-\ntance of a highly qualified workforce as a factor\nfor competitive advantage (Pfeffer, 1994; Wright,\nMcMahan, and McWilliams, 1994; Greenhaus and\nParasuraman, 1999; Lobel, 1999). Training and\ndevelopment of firm-specific knowledge make\nskilled workers a scarce resource for the firm\n(Legge, 1998; Snell and Dean, 1992; Kleiner et al.,\n1987; Terpstra and Rozell, 1993) as their knowl-\nedge would not be easily replaceable (Barney,\n1991; Wright and McMahan, 1992; Wright et al.,\n1994; Conner and Prahalad, 1996). Since college-\neducated workers are more likely to receive such\ntraining, they may be able to extract a larger part\nof the firm\u2019s quasi-rents (Freidson, 1970; Raelin,\n1986). While part of these rents will be distributed\nby way of higher salaries, highly skilled workers\nmay also demand more FFWP as a result of their\nbargaining position (Osterman, 1995). We there-\nfore hypothesize the following:\nHypothesis 2: Firms with a higher proportion of\nskilled employees offer more FFWP.\nFemale participation\nThe majority of family and caring duties are ful-\nfilled by women (Shelton and John, 1996; Green-\nhaus and Parasuraman, 1999; Abbott, De Cieri,\nand Iverson, 1998; Borrill and Kidd, 1994; Judge,\nBoudreau, and Bretz, 1994; Konrad and Mangel,\n2000), and FFWP are affected by the proportion\nof employees likely to take them up when offered.\nWe expect the proportion of female employees to\naffect the provision of FFWP for two related rea-\nsons: First, female employees may demand more\nfavorable FFWP at their workplace (Konrad and\nMangel, 2000; De Cieri et al., 2005), which makes\nit advantageous and\/or necessary for a firm to pro-\nvide them. Note that this is irrespective of whether\nFFWP affect performance or not. Following our\nbasic model introduced in our general framework,\nEquation (2) allows for other motivations such as\nemployee work-life balance to guide FFWP pro-\nvision. Assuming that women demand and benefit\nrelatively more from FFWP than men, it would\nsimply be a case of enhancing work-life balance\nfor a large proportion of a firm\u2019s employees. Sec-\nond, the female employees best placed to imple-\nment improvements in FFWP are managers (Harel,\nTzafrir, and Baruch, 2003; Harrigan, 1981; Daily,\nCerto, and Dalton, 1999). Managers are also likely\nto be in a better bargaining position to negotiate\npractices beneficial to their own well-being. Both\nthese factors imply that, irrespective of the overall\nproportion of female employees, a higher propor-\ntion of female managers will be associated with\nmore favorable FFWP (Goodstein, 1994, 1995;\nIngram and Simons, 1995). In other words, we\nexpect female managers to be associated with more\nFFWP, not only because they are likely to be con-\nsidered \u2018important\u2019 employees by top management\nbut also because they are more likely to overcome\nresistance by top management to implement these\npractices. We summarize our hypotheses on the\nrole of female employees, particularly managers,\non FFWP as follows:\nHypothesis 3a: Firms with a higher proportion\nof female employees offer more FFWP.\nHypothesis 3b: Firms with a higher proportion\nof female managers offer more FFWP.\nManagement practices\nWe argued that good management and a multi-\ntude of FFWP offered fulfill different roles for the\nfirm. For example, use of \u2018total quality manage-\nment\u2019 (Young et al., 2001), bundles of HR prac-\ntices (Huselid, 1995), and specific practices like\nmentoring (Ragins, Cotton, and Miller, 2000), as\nwell as use of FFWP may simply be signs that\nan organization can effectively meet the needs of\ndifferent stakeholders\u2014investors, employees, or\neven society as a whole (Brammer and Milling-\nton, 2008; Murillo-Luna et al., 2008; David et al.,\n2007). This may be either because the decision\nmakers within an organization have the skills and\nabilities to successfully implement firm practices\nbenefiting any group of stakeholders, or because\nthere is a financial incentive for management to\nimplement them (Coombs and Gilley, 2005). Fur-\nther, if both good management in general and\nFFWP specifically contribute to resource building\nas argued above (Barney, 1991), we would expect\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors.

We therefore hypothesize the\nfollowing:\nHypothesis 4: Firms with good management\npractices offer more FFWP.\nCompetitive pressure\nIn addition to internal characteristics of the firm\nassociated with the provision of more FFWP, there\nmay also be external pressure to provide more\n(or less) of these practices. The firm\u2019s environ-\nment and pressure to focus on financial results is\nexpected to play a particularly important role. Such\npressures are likely to originate either from a firm\u2019s\nexposure to foreign competition or from deregu-\nlation or other structural features of its primary\nmarket. Previous work shows that the degree of\ncompetition and other structural features of a firm\u2019s\nproduct market may affect the provision of HR\npractices in general (Youndt et al., 1996; Koch and\nMcGrath, 1996; Datta, Guthrie, and Wright, 2005)\nand FFWP in particular (Perry-Smith and Blum,\n2000; Milliken et al., 1998), not least because pres-\nsure on financial results demands practices like\nlong hours (De Cieri et al., 2005; Kirby and Krone,\n2002; Nord et al., 2002; Smith, 1994; Wolcott\nand Glezer, 1995), which are incompatible with a\nwide range of FFWP in a firm (Ouchi, 1980; Tsui\net al., 1997; Ehrenberg and Smith, 1997; Gerhart\nand Milkovich, 1992; Coff, 1997). Further, pre-\nvious research has found that competitive pressure\nforces firms to improve their management practices\n(Bloom and Van Reenen, 2007, 2010b), which\nsuggests that underutilized resources or practices\ndelivering modest (if any) financial benefits will\nbe avoided. We summarize these arguments in the\nfollowing hypothesis:\nHypothesis 5: Firms in more competitive prod-\nuct markets offer less FFWP.\nDATA AND PROCEDURES\nTo investigate these issues, we construct robust\nmeasures of FFWP, work-life balance, manage-\nment practices, and our independent and control\nvariables across our four sampled countries (Ger-\nmany, France, the United Kingdom, and the United\nStates). We first discuss the collection of FFWP,\nwork-life balance, and management data, which\nwas undertaken using an innovative firm survey\ntool, and then the collection of performance data\nand firm characteristics taken from more standard\nfirm and industry data sources. This data is also\nfreely available online to enable easy replication\nof all results in the paper.5\nOur variables are defined in Table 1a, and\ndescriptive statistics are in Table 1b. The sampling\nprocedure is detailed in Table A4 in the Appendix.\nThe correlation matrix is given in Table 1c.\nScoring FFWP and management practices\nMeasuring FFWP and management practices\nrequires codifying these concepts into something\napplicable across different firms and countries.\nThis is difficult, as FFWP and good management\nare hard to define. To do this, we combine con-\ncepts that have been used previously, for example\nin (i) the U.K. Workplace Employment Relations\nSurvey (WERS), (ii) a management practice eval-\nuation tool developed by a leading international\nmanagement consultancy, and (iii) the prior man-\nagement and economics literature. While our focus\nhere is on the determinants and consequences of\nFFWP, we use good management practices as con-\ntrol variables in our performance regressions.\nFFWP and work-life balance perceptions\nIn Appendix A3, we detail the HR interview guide\nthat was used to collect a range of detailed FFWP\nand characteristics from firms. Focusing on the use\nof voluntary FFWP, we minimize the influence of\ndifferent regulatory regimes on FFWP provision.\nWe collected three types of data:\n\u2022 The first was managers\u2019 perceptions on their\nown firm\u2019s work-life balance versus that of other\nfirms in the industry. This was used as our work-\nlife balance outcome measure (WLB), defined as\nthe response to the question: \u2018Relative to other\ncompanies in your industry, how much does\nyour company emphasize work-life balance?\u2019\nscored as: much less (1); slightly less (2); the\nsame (3); slightly more (4); much more (5).\nWe use this variable to validate the claim that\n\u2202w\/\u2202X \u2265 0 , that is, FFWP are effective in\n5 See http:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/\u223cnbloom\/SMJFiles.zip.

This was gathered by asking the fol-\nlowing question on childcare flexibility: \u2018How\nmuch flexibility is there if an employee needed\nto take a day off at short notice due to childcare\nproblems or their child was sick?\u2019 and entitle-\nments to \u2018working at home in normal working\nhours,\u2019 \u2018switching from full-time to part-time\nwork,\u2019 \u2018job sharing schemes,\u2019 and \u2018financial sub-\nsidy to help pay for childcare.\u20196\n\u2022 The third was workforce characteristics data\non variables including average employee age,\nhours, holidays, and the proportion of female\nemployees, plus information on skills (the pro-\nportion of college-educated), trainings, and\nunionization. This data was used to test our\nhypotheses on the internal determinants of\nFFWP.\n6 Note that our measure of FFWP provision does not measure\nthe actual take-up of these practices within the firm, which\ndepends on social and firm-wide norms (Drago and Wooden,\n1992; Thompson, Beauvais, and Lyness, 1999) and personal and\nfamily characteristics (Gray, 1989; Grover and Crooker, 1995;\nLobel, 1991). This is because we focus on the supply of FFWP\nas a decision variable by firms. However, our FFWP score is\nsignificantly positively correlated with self-reported work-life\nbalance in the firm, suggesting that FFWP are taken up to\nimprove firm work-life balance.\nWe subsequently constructed our FFWP mea-\nsure as the composite z-score (see below) of all five\ndimensions on FFWP as well as the hours worked\nand holidays taken. Using alternative measures of\nFFWP (see Table 2) gives similar results.\nManagement practices\nWe follow Bloom and Van Reenen (2007, 2010b)\nin our definition of good management practices.\nThey find that the external validity of their man-\nagement score is high given its strong and posi-\ntive correlation with firm performance.7 We group\nmanagement practices into four areas: \u2018operations\u2019\n(three practices), \u2018monitoring\u2019 (five practices), \u2018tar-\ngets\u2019 (five practices), and \u2018incentives\u2019 (five prac-\ntices). The operations management section focuses\non the introduction of lean manufacturing tech-\nniques, the documentation of process improve-\nments, and the rationale behind introductions of\nimprovements. The monitoring section focuses\non the tracking of the performance of individu-\nals, reviewing performance (e.g., through regular\nappraisals and job plans), and consequence man-\nagement (e.g., making sure that plans are kept and\n7 They also do survey re-rater tests by reinterviewing 10 percent\nof the sample using different interviewers and interviewees\n(different plant managers) in the same firm. They find these\nindependent surveys to be highly significantly correlated. For\nexample, the intrafirm correlation of the management scores for\nthe 64 firms interviewed repeatedly were correlated at 0.734 (p-\nvalue of 0.001), suggesting the two different interviews were\nproviding broadly consistent information about firm practices.\nSee Bloom and Van Reenen (2010a) for details.\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors. Strategic Management Journal published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt.

Finally,\nincentives (or people management) include pro-\nmotion criteria, pay and bonuses, and the fixing\nor firing of bad performers, where best practice\nis deemed to be an approach that gives strong\nrewards for those with both ability and effort.\nThese practices are all ranked on a scale of 1\u20135.\nThe key step to scoring management practices\nis the use of \u2018double-blind\u2019 surveys. The first\npart of double-blind is that the survey was con-\nducted by telephone without telling managers they\nwere being scored. This enabled scoring to be\nbased on the interviewers\u2019 evaluation of actual firm\npractices, rather than the firms\u2019 aspirations, man-\nagers\u2019 perceptions, or the interviewers\u2019 impres-\nsions. To run this blind scoring, we used open\nquestions (e.g., \u2018Can you tell me how you pro-\nmote your employees?\u2019) rather than closed ones\n(e.g., \u2018Do you promote your employees on tenure\n[yes\/no]?\u2019). These questions target actual prac-\ntices and examples, with the discussion continu-\ning until the interviewer can accurately assess the\nfirm\u2019s typical practices. In most cases, three or\nfour questions were needed to score each practice.\nThe survey was targeted at plant managers, who\nare typically senior enough to have an overview\nof management practices, but not so senior as\nto be detached from day-to-day operations of the\nenterprise.\nThe second part of double-blind is that the inter-\nviewers did not know anything about the firms\u2019\nfinancial information or performance prior to the\ninterview. This was achieved by selecting medium-\nsized manufacturing firms (who interviewers have\ntypically not heard of before) and by providing\nonly firm names and contact details (but no finan-\ncial details) to the interviewers. The interviewers\nwere specially trained graduate students from top\nEuropean and U.S. business schools. All inter-\nviews were conducted in the respective manager\u2019s\nnative language. Since each interviewer ran over\n50 interviews on average, we could include inter-\nviewer fixed effects in all specifications to address\npotential concerns over inconsistent interpretation\nof categorical responses.\nFinally, detailed information was collected on\nthe interview process itself (number and type of\nprior contacts before obtaining the interview, dura-\ntion, local time of day, date, and day of the\nweek), the manager (gender, seniority, national-\nity, company and job tenure, internal and exter-\nnal employment experience, and location), and the\ninterviewer (we include interviewer fixed effects,\ntime of day, and a subjective reliability score\nassigned by the interviewer). Some of these sur-\nvey controls are significantly informative about the\nmanagement score, and when we use these as con-\ntrols for interview noise in our estimations, the\ncoefficients on the management score and FFWP\ntypically increase, suggesting we are removing sur-\nvey noise.\nObtaining interviews with managers\nInterviews took about 50 minutes on average and\nwere run from a single U.K. site. Overall, we\nobtained a high response rate of 54 percent, which\nwas achieved through four steps:\n\u2022 First, the interview was introduced as \u2018a piece\nof work\u20198 without discussion of the firm\u2019s finan-\ncial position or company accounts, making it\nrelatively uncontroversial for managers to par-\nticipate. Interviewers did not discuss financials\nin the interviews, both to maximize managers\u2019\nparticipation and to ensure our interviewers were\ntruly blind on the firm\u2019s financial position.\n\u2022 Second, questions were ordered to begin with\nthe least controversial (shop floor management)\nand finish with the most controversial (pay,\npromotions, and firings). The FFWP questions\nwere placed at the end of the interview to\nensure as much candor as possible in managers\u2019\nresponses.\n\u2022 Third, the performance of the interviewers was\nmonitored as was the proportion of interviews\nachieved, so interviewers were persistent in\nchasing firms (the median number of contacts\neach interviewer had per interview was 6.4). The\nquestions are also about practices within the firm\nthat any plant manager can respond to, so there\nwere potentially several managers per firm who\ncould be contacted.9\n8 Words like \u2018survey\u2019 or \u2018research\u2019 were avoided, as these are\nused by switchboards to block market research calls.\n9 We found no significant correlation between the number, type,\nand time span of contacts before an interview is conducted and\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors.

Van Reenen\n\u2022 Fourth, written endorsements of the \u2018Bundes-\nbank\u2019 (in Germany), the \u2018Banque de France,\u2019\nand the \u2018Treasury\u2019 (in the United Kingdom)\nhelped demonstrate to managers that this was\nan important exercise with official support.\nSampling frame and additional data\nWe focus on the manufacturing sector, where most\neconomists regard productivity as easier to mea-\nsure than in the nonmanufacturing sector (see\nGriliches [1994] for a discussion). Moreover, we\nfocused on medium-sized firms, selecting a sam-\nple where employment ranged between 50 and\n10,000 workers (with a median of 700). Very small\nfirms have little publicly available data, so mea-\nsuring performance from public sources would be\ndifficult. On the other hand, very large firms are\nlikely to be more heterogeneous across plants, and\nit would be difficult to get a representative pic-\nture of FFWP in the firm as a whole from just\none or two plant interviews. We drew a sampling\nframe from each country to be representative of\nmedium-sized manufacturing firms, and then ran-\ndomly chose the order in which firms were con-\ntacted (see Appendix A4 for details). We excluded\nany clients of our partnering consultancy firm from\nour sampling frame.\nComparing the responding firms with those in\nthe sampling frame, we found no evidence that\nresponders were systematically different from non-\nresponders on any of the performance measures.\nThey were also statistically similar on all other\nobservables in our dataset, except on size where\nour firms were on average slightly larger than those\nin the sampling frame.\nProductivity and competition data\nQuantitative information on firm sales, employ-\nment, capital, materials, and so forth came from\ncompany accounts and proxy statements, and was\nused to calculate firm-level labor and total factor\nproductivity and profitability. The details are pro-\nvided in Appendix A4. To measure competition,\nwe follow Nickell (1996) and Aghion et al. (2005)\nin using two broad measures. The first measure\nthe FFWP and management scores. This suggests that while\ndifferent managers may respond differently to the interview\nproposition, this does not appear to be directly correlated with\ntheir responses or firm management.\nis obtained by calculating the three-digit indus-\ntry Lerner index of competition by country, which\nis (1 \u2212 prof its\/sales), calculated as the aver-\nage across the entire firm-level database (exclud-\ning each firm itself).10 This is constructed for the\nperiod 1995\u20131999 to remove any potential con-\ntemporaneous feedback. The second measure of\ncompetition is the survey question on the number\nof competitors a firm faces (see Appendix A3),\nvalued 0 for \u2018no competitors,\u2019 1 for \u2018less than five\ncompetitors,\u2019 and 2 for \u2018five or more competitors.\u2019\nWe also use three-digit import penetration of sales\nto measure exposure to international competition.\nRESULTS\nValidation issues and descriptive statistics\nUsing FFWP z-scores\nAs mentioned above, we convert our survey\nresponses on FFWP into z-scores. That is, we\ntransform each firm\u2019s response on a FFWP, Xi ,\nas follows:\nzi = Xi \u2212 Xi\n\u03c3Xi\n(4)\nBy subtracting the sample mean of practice Xi\nand dividing by the standard deviation, we elim-\ninate problems of consistently different levels of\nprovision of specific practices. For example, if a\nchildcare subsidy is provided much less frequently\nthan childcare flexibility, a simple sum of the raw\nFFWP scores would imply that an above average\nscore in a childcare subsidy may have the same\ncontribution to the composite score as a below\naverage score in childcare flexibility. Constructing\na z-score avoids these problems. From our indi-\nvidual scores, we then construct a \u2018double-z-score\u2019\nby summing all individual z-scores and performing\nthe same procedure on the sum, that is:\nzzi =\n\u2211\nzi \u2212\n\u2211\nzi\n\u03c3\u2211 zi\n(5)\nThis lets us interpret the regression coefficients\nintuitively\u2014for example, a one unit change in an\n10 Note that in constructing this measure we draw on all firms in\nthe population database, not just those in the survey.\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors.

However, dif-\nferent regulatory environments may imply that\nsome practices are more common in some coun-\ntries than others. For example, hours worked are\naffected in Germany and France by the EU Work-\ning Time Directive, limiting employees to a max-\nimum of 48 hours per working week. To account\nfor this, we constructed a number of different\nmeasures of FFWP, omitting and including prac-\ntices that may differ systematically across coun-\ntries. We also performed a factor analysis on our\nindividual practices\u2019 z-scores and used the high-\nest loading factor as an alternative FFWP score.\nTable 2 gives the correlations between the respec-\ntive FFWP scores.11\nDescriptive statistics\nThe first issue we address is the association\nbetween FFWP and perceived work-life balance.\nIn Appendix A1, we show that many individual\nFFWP are significantly associated with the work-\nlife balance score reported by plant managers, and\nthat all signs go in the expected direction (i.e.,\nnegative for hours worked, positive for all others).\nMost importantly, our aggregate z-score of FFWP\nhas a coefficient of 0.259 and is highly significant,\nso that a one standard deviation improvement in\nthe FFWP score will be associated with a 0.259\nimprovement in self-reported work-life balance.\nThe second issue we examine in more detail is\nthe connection between our two composite vari-\nables, FFWP and management practices. As FFWP\nare often regarded as part of strategic human\nresource management, one might expect a posi-\ntive correlation between FFWP and good manage-\nment practices. The regression results for individ-\nual management practices on our FFWP score are\nreported in Appendix A2. We find that a number\nof individual management practices are positively\nand significantly associated with the provision of\n11 We ran all regressions with our alternative FFWP scores with\nno qualitative differences.

Most notably, when running our preferred\nregression with all individual dimensions of man-\nagement practices, we find that the incentives cate-\ngory is significant and positive in our basic FFWP\nregression. Thus, firms offering more FFWP also\nhave better people management practices, suggest-\ning that firms for which human capital is an impor-\ntant resource tend to both treat and manage their\nemployees better.\nRegression results\u2014consequences of FFWP\nIn our first set of regressions, we focus on the\nperformance effects of FFWP. Our results on the\nassociation of firm performance with FFWP are\ngiven in Table 3.\nColumn (1) in Table 3 finds a positive associa-\ntion between our FFWP score and a firm\u2019s labor\nproductivity (i.e., sales per employee).12 This is\nin line with a number of previous studies (Perry-\nSmith and Blum, 2000; Gray and Tudball, 2003;\nMilliken et al., 1998). However, in Column (2),\nwe find that once we control for the management\npractices used in a firm, the coefficient\u2019s magnitude\ndrops drastically and becomes completely insignif-\nicant. This is in line with our Hypothesis 4 that\nbetter run firms offer more FFWP. It does, how-\never, suggest that omitting the set of management\npractices typically found jointly with FFWP will\nlead to spurious correlation between FFWP and\nfirm performance. Our remaining columns (3\u20138)\nconfirm this result: there seems to be no posi-\ntive and significant correlation between FFWP and\nfirm performance when controlling for all inputs\n(3) and measuring performance as a return on cap-\nital employed (5\u20138) once management practices\nare controlled for. Allowing all production-related\ncoefficients to vary by country (Columns (4) and\n(8)) does not change results either. Hypothesis 1,\ntherefore, finds no support in our regressions. Note\nthat an insignificant (or positive) result on our\nnarrow performance measure (sales per employee)\nand a negative one on our broader measure (return\non capital employed [ROCE]) would have implied\nthat firms offering generous FFWP do not receive\nthe targeted benefits (through increased sales per\nemployee), but bear the cost of implementing\nthem (which would result in a negative correlation\nbetween FFWP and ROCE).

One reason would be that some\nkey employees can (or will) work more produc-\ntively if they are presented with a bundle of\nFFWP. In other words, providing FFWP can help\nturn certain groups of employees into a valuable\nresource by improving retention or making them\nwork more productively.

For example, an interaction\nterm between the percentage of female managers\nor skilled employees and FFWP should then carry\na positive and significant sign in a performance\nregression. We report our results with interaction\nterms in Table 4 and find that none of the interac-\ntion terms (with management, skills, or the propor-\ntion of female managers) are significant, suggest-\ning that FFWP are not provided to keep valuable\ngroups of employees or motivate them to work\nmore productively.\nA second possible explanation is that firms end\nup implementing FFWP because a number of key\nemployees demand it and firms value the well-\nbeing, and specifically the work-life balance, of\ntheir employees as well as the financial perfor-\nmance of the firm. This is consistent with our\nmodel presented in our general framework, where\ntwo processes generate two outputs\u2014work-life\nbalance and financial performance.

That is, although FFWP alone\ndo not have a tangible effect on firm performance,\nit is still the well-managed firms that implement\nthem more readily.\nFinally, it may be that firms are optimally choos-\ning the correct degree of FFWP for their firms,\nso there is no systematic variation to identify\nthe performance equations. If there were no opti-\nmization errors, no exogenous shocks, and no\nadjustment costs, we could not identify the coef-\nficient of FFWP on performance, even if one\nexisted. Although this is possible theoretically, it is\nunlikely to be the whole story in empirical practice.\n15 The positive and significant coefficient on management quality\nis robust to including a number of noise controls pertaining\nto the interview process, including interviewer dummies, the\nseniority, gender, tenure, and number of countries worked in of\nthe manager who responded, the day of the week the interview\nwas conducted, the time of the day the interview was conducted,\nthe duration of the interview, and an indicator of the reliability\nof the information as coded by the interviewer.\n16 The total percentage of female employees was omitted due to\nthe high degree of colinearity between the total percentage and\nthe percentage of female managers. Coefficients and significance\nof the other variables remain virtually unaffected by the inclusion\nof the total percentage of female employees.\nRegression results\u2014determinants of FFWP\nWe now turn to our regressions on the determi-\nnants of FFWP provision. Our results are given in\nTable 5.\nWe can see from Table 5 that the proportion of\nskilled employees has a robust positive association\nwith the provision of FFWP. Column (1) uses\nbasic controls only, while Column (8) includes all\nvariables of interest. We find that although the level\nof significance decreases once management and the\nproportion of female managers are included,17 the\ncoefficient is consistently positive. Hypothesis 2 is,\ntherefore, broadly supported.\nThe percentage of female managers is also posi-\ntively and significantly correlated with FFWP pro-\nvision in Columns (3) and (8). The overall pro-\nportion of female employees is not significant\nas seen in Column (2), which suggests a com-\nplex relationship between female employees and\nFFWP provision. It is not simply the proportion\n17 Omitting either the proportion of female managers or manage-\nment results in a significant coefficient on skills, which is not\nsurprising as using all three internal variables simultaneously\nmay cause colinearity problems.\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors.

Rather, it is the presence of a group of\nkey employees\u2014female managers\u2014that places a\ncomparably higher value on more FFWP in an\norganization. There are at least two possible inter-\npretations of this. Either, female managers nego-\ntiate a bundle of advantageous FFWP when in\nthe firm (bargaining effect), or they choose to\nwork only for firms that provide sufficiently gener-\nous FFWP (self-selection effect). As always with\ncross-sectional data, the direction of causality is\nhard to establish, but the positive coefficient of the\nproportion of female managers on FFWP is robust\nand significant, suggesting tangible differences in\nFFWP policies among firms with different gender\nworkforce composition. We therefore find support\nfor Hypothesis 3b, but not Hypothesis 3a.\nThe final variable relating to the internal char-\nacteristics of the workplace are the management\npractices in a firm. In all our regressions, the coeffi-\ncient on good management practices is positive and\nhighly significant\u2014see Columns (4) and (8). This\nsuggests that well-run firms offer their employ-\nees more FFWP. Therefore, Hypothesis 4 on the\nconcurrent use of good management practices and\nadvantageous FFWP is supported. However, as\nshown above, FFWP have no independent effect\non financial performance.\nOur hypotheses on external determinants of\nFFWP are tested in Columns (5)\u2013(8) of Table 5.\nWe find that import penetration (5) and the gen-\neral degree of competition in an industry (Columns\n(6) and (7)) are not associated with more or less\nFFWP. In our regression with all covariates (8),\nthe external determinants remain insignificant. The\nrejection of Hypothesis 5 is in contrast to the\nstrong support of our earlier hypotheses on inter-\nnal determinants of FFWP. It suggests that external\npressure to provide or abandon FFWP is not as\nsignificant as the influence of factors at the work-\nplace itself\u2014either through the composition of the\nworkforce (i.e., more skilled workers and more\nfemale managers) or the general use of good man-\nagement practices. Further, our results also suggest\nthat firms operating in tough product markets try\nto cope with the situation by means other than\nreducing the number of FFWP available to their\nemployees. This is especially interesting as these\nproduct market competition variables have been\nfound to be strongly correlated with good man-\nagement practices.\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nIn this paper, we studied the impact of FFWP on\nfirm performance and found that increased provi-\nsion of FFWP is only positively correlated with\nbetter firm performance if we omit management\nquality. Once we control for general manage-\nment quality, there is no significant association\nbetween FFWP and performance measured in dif-\nferent ways. This raises the question of why firms\nwould want to implement them in the first place.\nTo investigate this, we studied the firm and envi-\nronmental characteristics that are correlated with\nincreased FFWP use, and find that firms with a\nhigher proportion of skilled workers and female\nmanagers, as well as better management prac-\ntices offer more FFWP. One interpretation of this\nis that firms must offer FFWP to avoid losing\nkey employees, which may constitute a valuable\nresource for the firm. In further analysis, however,\nwe find that this is unlikely to be a driving factor\nfor FFWP provision, as firms with more female\nmanagers or skilled workers do not benefit more\nfrom FFWP than others. Instead, our results are\nconsistent with firms valuing more than just finan-\ncial performance when choosing their strategies.\nThis resonates with the recent work on corpo-\nrate social responsibility (Brammer and Milling-\nton, 2008; David et al., 2007) and environmental\nsustainability (Murillo-Luna et al., 2008).\nOur \u2018non-results\u2019 on the performance impact of\nFFWP combined with the results on the inter-\nnal determinants of FFWP use have implications\nfor resource-based view (RBV) scholars, espe-\ncially those interested in human capital as a firm\nresource. Our findings suggest that FFWP bun-\ndles are not a general \u2018best practice\u2019 that improves\nfirm performance in the sense of a firm capabil-\nity or resource. There is also no indication that\nFFWP help firms create more value from specific\nemployee groups, specifically female managers\nand skilled workers. Rather, our results support\nthe conclusion that FFWP are neither a value-\ncreating bundle of activities nor a lever for existing\nresources\u2014they do not affect firm performance\ndirectly or indirectly. While explicit tests of the\nRBV are difficult to execute (Arend, 2006; New-\nbert, 2007), our results do not suffer from con-\nfirmatory bias arising from tautological resource\ndefinitions and narrow performance measures\nignoring costs, as we consider both productivity\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors.

A more rigorous test\nof FFWP as a firm resource would have to meet\nadditional criteria (Arend, 2006), but these criteria\nmainly rule out false positives, that is, activities\nthat are identified as resources but really are not.\nIndeed, earlier studies may have attributed FFWP a\nfalse positive impact by failing to control for other\nVRIO resources (Arend, 2006) and by considering\nrestrictive performance measures, something our\ncomparatively more stringent test does not do.\nOne possible implication from the discussion\nabove is that FFWP have no role to play in organi-\nzations that maximize financial performance. Note,\nhowever, that the provision of FFWP is also not\nnegatively correlated with firm financial perfor-\nmance. This rebuts the claim that providing FFWP\ndetracts from profits. Given the positive relation-\nship between the provision of FFWP and actual\nwork-life balance, our results show that although\nproviding FFWP may not increase profits, they at\nleast pay for themselves. If employees\u2019 well-being\nis tied to work-life balance, they can be made bet-\nter off with investors no worse off. The overall\nprovision of stakeholder desires is thus increased\nwith the provision of FFWP.\nOur results have implications for future research\nin several fields. Specifically, studies on the perfor-\nmance effects of FFWP from a RBV perspective\nshould control for other dimensions of manage-\nment practices to reliably isolate the performance\neffects of such practices, and thus identify their\nvalue as a firm resource (Arend, 2006). \u2018Intangi-\nbles\u2019 like managerial capabilities that affect per-\nformance and are correlated with tangible firm\ncharacteristics have to be taken into account in\nfuture studies (Carmeli and Tishler, 2004). The\nproblem of unobservables is likely to resurface\nin many studies trying to identify and evaluate\nfirm resources. Our results also matter for HR\nmanagers and academics who group FFWP under\nstrategic human resource management alongside\na number of other, performance enhancing HR\npractices. FFWP have implications different from\nother strategic human resource management prac-\ntices, as they affect employee well-being rather\nthan firm financial performance. FFWP should\nnot be criticized for their lack of positive finan-\ncial impact, as they do have a tangible effect on\nemployee well-being. Therefore, FFWP should be\ntreated as policies that improve firm performance\nin terms of the satisfaction of a particular stake-\nholder group\u2014the firm\u2019s employees\u2014but that\nfinancial performance should not be the primary\ngoal of implementing FFWP. Our work also feeds\ninto a wider, emerging research field of nonmarket\nstrategies affecting auxiliary performance dimen-\nsions. Researchers face a complex problem with\nfirms choosing strategies to serve multiple stake-\nholders. Firm characteristics affect these strategic\nactions in complex ways, and there may be inter-\nactions between the different performance dimen-\nsions that have to be identified empirically rather\nthan assumed (or ignored) a priori.\nOur results carry some limitations. First, we\nfocus on manufacturing firms. We do this mainly\nto avoid problems in measuring firm performance,\nbut it would be interesting to compare our results\nwith data from the service sector. Second, we do\nnot measure the degree to which FFWP are taken\nup by employees. While this has some disadvan-\ntages, it has the advantage of capturing the pro-\nvision of FFWP rather than their take-up in the\nworkforce, which may be conflated with questions\nof corporate culture, peer pressure, and so forth. In\nother words, while provision of FFWP is a deci-\nsion variable by the firm, take-up of FFWP will\nat the very least be the result of a combination of\nFFWP supply (by the firm) and demand (by its\nemployees). Third, we only sample firms with less\nthan 10,000 employees, so we lose the very largest\nfirms (although since we use subsidiaries, some of\nthe parents of our firms are very large). We do not\nthink this biases our results, but studying the very\nlargest firms would also be of interest.\nOur work could be extended in several ways.\nWe used country dummies in all our regressions\nand found significant differences in FFWP provi-\nsion across our four sampled countries\u2014Germany,\nFrance, the United Kingdom, and the United\nStates.18 We do not discuss these results in detail,\nbut it is a promising avenue of future research to\nstudy cross-country differences in FFWP scores\nto find different international models of FFWP.\nFurther, the role of female managers in FFWP pro-\nvision is interesting. Specifically, our result that it\n18 The signs of our country dummies show that firms in European\ncountries offer significantly more FFWP than U.S.-based firms\nafter controlling for observables, while labor productivity in\nContinental Europe tends to be higher after controlling for input\nfactors. Further results on the country dummy coefficients are\navailable on request.\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors. Strategic Management Journal published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt.

Will female\nmanagers not work for firms that do not provide\nsufficient FFWP, or are they more successful in\n\u2018pushing through\u2019 the provision of such practices?\nThe well-known stylized fact that female man-\nagers are paid less than their male peers19 suggests\nthat firms compensate their female workforce with\nmore FFWP. This is a highly relevant topic for\nfuture research.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank the Anglo-German Foundation and the\nESRC for financial support, Marlo Go\u00a8tting and\nChristina Finsterwalder for excellent research\nassistance, and Alex Bryson, Alex Edmans, Fer-\ndinand Mahr, Anja Tuschke, Ingo Weller, Editor\nWill Mitchell, two referees, and seminar partici-\npants at the 2007 Academy of Management meet-\nings, University of Toronto, INSEAD, Hong Kong\nUniversity of Science and Technology, HEC Paris,\nAston Business School, Kent Business School, TU\nDarmstadt, WZB Berlin, and DG EMP for com-\nments.

These all have information on\ncompany accounting data. We chose firms whose\nprincipal industry was in manufacturing and who\nemployed (on average between the years 2000 and\n2003) no less than 50 employees and no more than\n10,000 employees. We also removed any clients\nof the consultancy firm we worked with from the\nsampling frame (33 out of 1,353 firms).\nOur sampling frame is reasonably representa-\ntive of medium-sized manufacturing firms. The\nEuropean firms in Amadeus include both private\nand public firms, whereas Compustat only includes\npublicly listed firms. There is no U.S. database\nwith privately listed firms with information on\nsales, labor, and capital. Fortunately, there is a\nmuch larger proportion of firms listed on the stock\nexchange in the United States than in Europe, so\nwe were able to go substantially down the size dis-\ntribution using Compustat. Nevertheless, the U.S.\nfirms in our sample are slightly larger than those of\nthe other countries, so we were always careful to\ncontrol for size and public listing in the analyses.\nAnother concern is that we conditioned on firms\nwhere we have information on sales, employment,\nand capital. These items are not compulsory for\nfirms below certain size thresholds, so disclosure\nis voluntary to some extent for the smaller firms.\nLuckily, the firms in our sampling frame (over\n50 workers) are past the threshold for voluntary\ndisclosure (the only exception is for capital in\nGermany).\nWe achieved a response rate of 54 percent from\nthe firms that we contacted: a very high success\nrate given the voluntary nature of participation.\nRespondents were not significantly more produc-\ntive than nonresponders. French firms were slightly\nless likely to respond than firms in the other three\ncountries, and all respondents seemed randomly\nspread around our sampling frame.\nFirm-level data\nOur firm accounting data on sales, employment,\ncapital, profits, shareholder equity, long-term debt,\nmarket values (for quoted firms), and wages (where\navailable) came from Amadeus (Germany, France,\nand the United Kingdom) and Compustat (United\nStates). For other data fields, we did the following:\nMaterials\nIn Germany and France, these are line items in\nthe accounts. In the United Kingdom, these were\nconstructed by deducting the total wage bill from\nthe cost of goods sold. In the United States, these\nwere constructed following the method in Bresna-\nhan, Brynjolfsson, and Hitt (2002). We start with\ncosts of goods sold (COGS) less depreciation (DP)\nless labor costs (XLR). For firms who do not report\nlabor expenditures, we use average wages and ben-\nefits at the four-digit industry level (Bartelsman,\nBecker, and Gray, 2000) until 1996, and then Cen-\nsus Average Production Worker Annual Payroll by\nfour-digit NAICS code and multiply this by the\nfirm\u2019s reported employment level. This constructed\nmeasure is highly correlated at the industry level\nwith materials. Obviously, there may be problems\nwith this measure of materials (and therefore value\nadded), which is why we check robustness to mea-\nsures without materials.\nIndustry-level data\nThis comes from the OECD STAN database of\nindustrial production. This is provided at the coun-\ntry ISIC Rev. 3 level and is mapped into U.S. SIC\n(1997) three-digits (which is our common industry\ndefinition in all four countries).\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors.
