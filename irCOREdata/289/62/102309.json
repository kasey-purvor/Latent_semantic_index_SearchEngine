INTRODUCTION\nSpin-orbit \u0001SO\u0002 induced spin splitting of the conduction\nbands of III\u2013V semiconductors has been studied extensively\nboth theoretically and experimentally,1\u20138 with more recent\nefforts linked with the growing interest in the field of\nspintronics9,10 and the development of a spin-based field ef-\nfect transistor.11 Narrow band-gap semiconductors such as\nInSb offer interesting characteristics for these applications\nsuch as small effective mass, inherently large SO coupling,\nand large effective Land\u00e9 g factor. Of particular relevance to\nspin transistor applications, the small effective mass gives\nrise to high electron mobility, and hence fast, low power\ndevices.12 The large SO coupling mixed across a small gap\nresults in a large Rashba effect \u0001see below\u0002, which means\nthat a large modulation of the spin lifetime with electric field\nis possible. Even though the large SO coupling results in a\nsmall spin lifetime in two-dimensional \u00012D\u0002 structures,\nwhich reduces the spin-diffusion length, this is mitigated by\nthe small effective mass.\nIt is now understood that the SO coupling in asymmetric\nquantum well \u0001QW\u0002 heterostructures results from the lack of\ninversion symmetry that originates from two predominant\nsources, which lift the spin degeneracy even in the absence\nof an applied magnetic field. The first is an intrinsic property\nof the zinc-blende crystal structure called bulk inversion\nasymmetry \u0001BIA\u0002, as described by Dresselhaus.13 In bulk\nsemiconductors, this mechanism leads to a spin splitting pro-\nportional to the wave vector cubed, k3, characterized by the\ncoefficient \u0003. However, in a spatially inhomogeneous struc-\nture such as a QW where the z axis is in the growth direction,\nkz is replaced by \u2212i\u0001 \/\u0001z within the envelope function ap-\nproximation \u0001EFA\u0002 and the BIA term is separated into two\ncontributions: a k-cubic term and a k-linear term character-\nized by the coefficient \u0004.1\nThe second source of inversion asymmetry is due to a\nchange in the macroscopic potential and band structure\nthrough a heterojunction interface, known as structural inver-\nsion asymmetry \u0001SIA\u0002, as described by Bychkov and\nRashba.14 This produces an additional spin splitting linear in\nk and characterized by the coefficient \u0005. The combined SO\nHamiltonian for SIA and BIA induced couplings for a 2D\nelectron gas \u00012DEG\u0002 confined in the x-y plane is of the\nform1,15\nHSO\u0001k\u0005\u0002 = \u0005\u0001kx\u0006y \u2212 ky\u0006x\u0002 + \u0004\u0001kx\u0006x \u2212 ky\u0006y\u0002\n+ \u0003\u0001kx\n2ky\u0006y \u2212 kxky\n2\u0006x\u0002 , \u00011\u0002\nwhere \u0006x and \u0006y are the Pauli spin matrices. The spin split-\nting induced by the SO coupling in Eq. \u00011\u0002 can be described\nby introducing a k-dependent effective magnetic field Bef f\u0001k\u0005\u0002\nabout which spins precess with an effective Larmor fre-\nquency \u0001\u0001k\u0005\u0002=g*\u0007BBef f\u0001k\u0005\u0002 \/\b, where \u0007B is the Bohr mag-\nnetron and g* is the effective Land\u00e9 g factor. The corre-\nsponding Hamiltonian describing the SO coupling can now\nbe rewritten in the form HSO\u0001k\u0005\u0002=\b\u0002 \u00b7\u0001\u0001k\u0005\u0002 analogous to a\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 77, 165335 \u00012008\u0002\n1098-0121\/2008\/77\u000116\u0002\/165335\u000113\u0002 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society165335-1\nZeeman term, where \u0002 is the vector of Pauli spin matrices\nand \u0001\u0001k\u0005\u0002 is given by\n\u0001\u0001k\u0005\u0002 =\n1\n\b\n\u0003\u0001\u0004kx \u2212 \u0005ky \u2212 \u0003kxky\n2\u0002,\u0001\u0005kx \u2212 \u0004ky + \u0003kx\n2ky\u0002,0\u0004 .\n\u00012\u0002\nThe rate of spin precession is thus determined by the mag-\nnitude of the SO interactions through the coupling param-\neters \u0005, \u0004, and \u0003. For this reason, the SIA mechanism or\n\u201cRashba effect,\u201d has been subject to considerable attention\nfor device applications as the heterostructure potential and\nhence the magnitude of \u0005 can be influenced by an electric\nfield due to an external gate electrode. This effect was first\nexploited in the spin field effect transistor \u0001S-FET\u0002 proposal\nby Datta and Das.11 As pointed out by D\u2019yakonov and\nPerel,16 the decoherence of an initially aligned \u0001polarized\u0002\npopulation of spins is driven by their individual precssion\nabout the vector \u0001\u0001k\u0005\u0002. For a spin polarized current in a\ndiffusive system, the presence of momentum scattering ran-\ndomly changes the wave vector k\u0005 in the time \u0002p, which in\nturn changes the orientation of the effective magnetic field,\nand precession vector. For frequent momentum scattering\nevents, the average precession frequency and hence spin re-\nlaxation rate are slowed \u0001motional narrowing\u0002, which leading\nto a characteristic spin relaxation rate \u0002s\t\u0002p\n\u22121\n. This is the\nD\u2019yakonov\u2013Perel \u0001DP\u0002 spin relaxation mechanism,16 shown\nto be present in most III\u2013V semiconductor systems over a\nbroad range of temperatures.17\u201320 It is essential for spintronic\ndevices as the dominance of this mechanism is necessary\nfor the gate modulation of spin populations.21 Recent experi-\nmental results, which appear to be consistent with the DP\nmechanism, indicate that it is dominant for high mobility\nn-type InSb \/ InAlSb QWs over a broad range of temp-\neratures.22 Experimental evidence for the gate control of \u0005\nhas now been demonstrated by the beating of Shubnikov\u2013de\nHaas \u0001SdeH\u0002 oscillations of magnetoresistance,6,7 quantum\ninterference effects such as weak antilocalization in low field\nmagnetoresistance,23 and, more recently, the modification of\nspin lifetime with gate has been attributed to SIA.21,24 Many\nof these measurements are indirect and would benefit from a\nrobust model, which incorporates realistic device structures\nas described here.\nZero-field Rashba splitting has previously been studied in\nsymmetric InSb QWs in the high barrier limit by Stanley et\nal.25 using Kane\u2019s eight-band k \u00b7p theory within the EFA. It\nwas found that the spin splitting was up to a factor of 2\ngreater than that of equivalent InAs QWs due to the larger\nsplit-off and smaller band-gap energies. Here, we extend the\nwork of Ref. 25 to more realistic n-InSb \/ In1\u2212xAlxSb asym-\nmetric heterostructures with finite barriers, considering real-\nistic growth constraints such as critical thickness strain re-\nlaxation, providing a comprehensive study of the influence of\nheterostructure design on the SO coupling parameters in\nthese structures. Critically, we take into account the penetra-\ntion of the wave function into the barriers, shown to add a\ndominant contribution to the Rashba coefficient \u0005,3,14 and\nwhich is shown here to also influence \u0004. Previously, it has\nbeen assumed that SIA is the dominant source of zero-field\nspin splitting in narrow gap semiconductors.5,8,15 In this pa-\nper, we present theoretical results counter to this assertion,\ndemonstrating that both the k-linear and k-cubic BIA terms\ncan give a significant contribution toward the total spin split-\nting and should not be neglected.\nIn addition to this, we calculate the DP spin lifetimes for\nthese heterostructures, considering the modifications to the\nspin lifetime field effect transistor \u0001SL-FET\u0002 as proposed by\nCartoixa et al.26 and Schliemann et al.27 in this material sys-\ntem with realistic coupling parameters. These devices are\nbased on the properties of the spin lifetime tensor in the DP\nregime due to the interference between BIA and SIA inter-\nactions. Following the theoretical results of Averkiev and\nGolub,28 the SL-FET exploits the tunable Rashba effect to\nachieve the conditions of \u0005=\u0004 and \u0005\u0002\u0004, in order to signifi-\ncantly change the spin lifetime and provide current modula-\ntion. This change occurs since for \u0005=\n\u0004 the direction of\n\u0001\u0001k\u0005\u0002 \u0001with \u0003=0\u0002 no longer depends on k, i.e., \u0001\u0001k\u0005\u0002\n\t\u0005\u0001\nkx\u2212ky\u0002\u00031,\n1,0\u0004 \u0003from Eq. \u00012\u0002\u0004 so that scattering\nevents change only its magnitude and not direction, allowing\nlong spin lifetimes for spins oriented in the \u0003110\u0004 and \u000311\u00af0\u0004\ndirections, respectively, i.e., when parallel to \u0001\u0001k\u0005\u0002.28 Al-\nthough the SL-FET concept has received some criticism as\nbeing a counterproductive incarnation of the original Datta\u2013\nDas S-FET,29 it is interesting to investigate the viability of\nbalancing the SIA and BIA interactions for the purpose of\nenhancing the spin lifetime in the InSb \/ In1\u2212xAlxSb QW sys-\ntem.\nThis paper is organized in the following way. In Sec. II,\nwe present the eight-band k \u00b7p model of Pfeffer and\nZawadzki5 and Deng et al.15 used for the calculations of\ncoupling coefficients.

This is a reason-\nable approximation since Ep is approximately constant for\nmost III\u2013V compounds.34 To be consistent with the model of\nDeng et al.,15 potential energies are measured relative to the\nconduction band edge at z=0 in the QW such that VQW\u00010\u0002\n=0 \u0001see Fig. 1\u0002.\nIII. CALCULATION OF COUPLING PARAMETERS\nSO coupling parameters \u0005, \u0004, and \u0003 are explicitly calcu-\nlated by evaluating the expectation values of Eqs. \u00017\u0002\u2013\u00019\u0002\nwith respect to \u000b\u0001z\u0002, i.e., \u0005= \t\u000b\u0001z\u0002\n\u0005\u02c6\u0001z ,\r\u0002\n\u000b\u0001z\u0002\u000b. The pre-\ncise form of the SIA and BIA SO Hamiltonians in Eq. \u00011\u0002 has\nsubtly varied between authors by a factor of \u22121 \u0001see Refs.\n26, 28, and 31\u0002, which can be absorbed within the coupling\nparameters. The polarity of the coupling parameters has no\neffect on the spin splitting. However, it is important for the\ndirection of \u0001\u0001k\u0005\u0002 and the spin lifetime calculations.30 Here,\nwe define the coupling parameters by mapping the off-\ndiagonal matrix elements of Eq. \u00013\u0002 to the form of Eq. \u00011\u0002.\nElectrostatic potentials \u0010\u0001z\u0002 and normalized electron wave\nfunctions \u000b\u0001z\u0002 for each structure are obtained self-\nconsistently at 10 K without spin splitting15 from solutions\nof A\u02c6\u000b\u0001z\u0002=\r\u000b\u0001z\u0002, using a one-band Schr\u00f6dinger\u2013Poisson\nmodel \u0001SPM\u0002 tailored to narrow band-gap materials.36 A\ntypical solution for a 20 nm QW is shown in Fig. 1. This\nSPM is a good approximation since the spin splitting is small\ngiving \u000b1\u0001z\u0002=\u000b2\u0001z\u0002=\u000b\u0001z\u0002.15\nIt has been shown in real structures to be beneficial for\ncarrier confinement, mobility, and surface gate leakage to\nhave alloy composition approaching the maximum barrier\nheight allowed for a given well width.12 For that reason, the\nvarious well widths considered here are modeled with barri-\ners of varying In1\u2212xAlxSb compositions to best meet this cri-\nterion, while also maintaining appropriate critical thicknesses\nfor strain relaxation in the QW. Accordingly, Al content in\nthe barrier increases as the well width is narrowed; the effect\nof which is that, counterintuitively, \u0005 is larger in wide well\nstructures for a given ns as discussed in detail below.\nTable I lists the parameters used in the SPM calculations\nfor each QW width considered. For each well width, the\ndoping density Nd and spacer thickness S are varied provid-\ning 16 different SPM solutions for a given W.

The InSb QW is\nassumed to be lattice matched to the lower barrier and ac-\ncordingly strained \u0001see Table. I\u0002. A 5% difference in Al com-\nposition is maintained in each structure for comparison, and\nis realistic in ensuring that the top barrier thickness remains\nbelow the critical thickness for strain relaxation.

It is assumed in this analysis\nthat the Fermi energy is pinned at midgap on the semicon-\nductor surface, consistent with the results of measurements\nundertaken in similar InSb QW systems.36,39,40 For all calcu-\nlations performed here, we restrict ourselves to solutions for\nzero bias, and to varying the doping parameters Nd and S\nsuch that only the lowest subband is occupied.\nA.

The carrier\ndensity in the well ns is determined by the amount of carriers\ntransferred into the 2DEG, which increases with Nd and de-\ncreasing S as more dopant is positioned closer to the QW.\nTherefore, we can combine the effects of Nd and S on \u0005 by\nanalysis of the variation of \u0005 with ns, as presented in Fig.\n2\u0001a\u0002 for the various well widths. Each data point thus repre-\nsents a separate SPM solution for varying Nd, S, and W.\nIt is found that for small carrier densities, the magnitude\nof \u0005 increases approximately linearly with ns due to an in-\ncreased conduction band bending in the top barrier. This\nleads to an increase in the potential asymmetry of the QW,\nweighting the wave function further toward the top interface\nand increasing \u000f\u000bI\n2 \u0001not presented here\u0002.

The third term in Eq. \u000110\u0002\nis the interface term I. In agreement with Bychkov and\nRashba,14 we find that the interface term dominates over the\nelectric field term as shown in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002 for the 20 nm QW.\nThe coefficients within the interface term, C0\u2212dVUBD0 and\nCW\u2212dVLBDW, are negative and weakly vary with ns com-\npared to \u000b\u00010\u0002 and \u000b\u0001W\u0002. As such, we find that the total\ncontribution to \u0005 is proportional to the asymmetry of the\nelectron probability density at the interfaces \u0001\u000f\u000bI\n2\u0002. The in-\nfluence of the electric field can be interpreted as facilitating\nthe asymmetry of the QW profile necessary to weight the\nwave function toward or away from an interface, thus vary-\ning \u000f\u000bI\n2\n. The resulting field term is positive as the inclusion\nof the electric field at the interfaces in \t\u000b\u0001z\u0002\nEeDi\n\u000b\u0001z\u0002\u000b re-\nsults in the addition of a large positive step \u0001the same step is\nsubtracted from the interface term\u0002. The observed small\nvariation of F with ns can be attributed to the competition of\nthe two component field terms F1 and F2, which have oppo-\nsite dependences on ns as shown in the inset of Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002. It is\nfound that the rate of change in F1 and F2, with ns varies\nwith well width, which results in a field term F whose de-\npendence on ns is observed to change as the well width is\nincreased from 15 nm. Since F2\u0012F1, we find that the elec-\ntric field in the conduction band is largely determined by the\nband offsets rather than the average electric field.\nThe most striking result of Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002 is that contrary to\nprevious studies,4,41 for a given carrier density, \u0005 is greatest\nin the wide QW structures, albeit with the drawback of a\ngreatly reduced capacity of the first subband compared to the\nnarrow wells, which limits the range of allowed ns. For this\nreason, larger Rashba coefficients can be achieved in nar-\nrower wells at increased carrier densities \u0003see Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002\u0004. The\nincreased confinement in narrow wells compared to wider\nwells had been assumed to increase the wave function pen-\netration into the barriers and hence \u0005 \u0001if the underlying\nasymmetry is the same in case\u0002. While this is true for wells\nof fixed barrier height, in the structures considered here,\nwhich are a better reflection of real devices, Al content in the\nbarriers and hence barrier heights \u0001with respect to the sub-\nband energy E1\u0002 are usually increased for the narrower well\nstructures, and the penetration of the wave function into the\nbarriers \u0001\u000f\u000bI\n2\u0002, and therefore \u0005, is reduced compared to the\nwider wells. The results of Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002 also show that the wider\nwells exhibit an increased sensitivity of \u0005 to doping and ns.\nThese results can be summarized by the assertion that for\na single-sided \u0001-doping scheme, for a given QW width and\nbarrier composition, \u0005 is proportional to ns \u0001where ns varies\nas a result of doping\u0002. This is also true for \u0001 doping located\nin the bottom barrier. However, a distinction between the two\nis evident when using an external gate to vary ns and \u0005. For\nstructures doped below the QW, the direction of the electric\nfield across the QW is reversed and although ns increases\nwith positive bias, the QW asymmetry, and hence \u0005, de-\ncreases as observed in the experimental results of Schapers et\nal.6 and Nitta et al.7 for InGaAs QWs. Structures doped\nabove the QW exhibit the opposite behavior of \u0005 increasing\nwith positive bias, although this has not been experimentally\ndemonstrated in literature.\n1. Comparison with previous experiment and theory\nOur calculated values of \u0005 can be compared to previous\nexperimental and theoretical studies of narrow gap InSb and\nInAs QWs available in literature. Consistent with previous\nstudies of InSb,5 \u0005 is found to be negative. This can also be\ndeduced from inspection of Eq. \u000110\u0002 and the direction of the\nelectric field across the well, whereby, providing that the\ncoefficients C0\u2212dVUBD0 and CW\u2212dVLBDW are negative, \u0005 is\nnegative as long as \u000f\u000bI\n2\n=\u000b2\u00010\u0002\u2212\u000b2\u0001W\u0002 is positive. It fol-\nlows from this argument that \u0005\u00120 for structures doped be-\nlow the QW, as was demonstrated by Nitta et al.7\nThe values of \u0005 for the well widths considered show good\nquantitative agreement with the simple one-band model ap-\nproximation of de Andrada e Silva et al.4 at low carrier den-\nsites where the nonparabolicity corrections are small. Khoda-\nparest et al.32 studied spin resonance in symmetric\nInSb \/ In0.91Al0.09Sb QWs where, assuming that all the spin\nsplitting originated from SIA, they estimated a zero field\nvalue of \u0005\u000e0.13 eV \u00c5 for a well width of 30 nm. These\nresults were described by Pfeffer and Zawadzki5 using the\neight-band k \u00b7p model described in Sec. II. This value is\nsomewhat larger than our estimates for a similar structure.\nGrundler42 investigated the gate dependence of \u0005 in symmet-\nric 4 nm InAs \/ InGaAs QWs via the beating of SdeH oscil-\nlations extracting values in the range 0.2\u20130.4 eV \u00c5. These\nvalues were estimated using an expression derived by Bluhm\net al.,43 which relate \u0005 to the difference in the populations of\nthe spin-split subbands \u000fn=n+\u2212n\u2212, which are determined\nfrom Fourier analysis of the beating patterns at low B fields\n\u0001B\u00133 T\u0002. This approach is somewhat unreliable as it is de-\nrived from the modified 2D density of states in the presence\nof Rashba splitting at B=0 T. Since the zero-field value of \u0005\nis calculated from transport data in nonzero B fields, the\nmeasurement includes contributions from the Zeeman term,\nhence overestimating \u0005. In fact, the Rashba coefficient is\nrarely measured in narrow gap semiconductors by this\nmethod due to the presence of large effective Land\u00e9 g factors\nand Zeeman splitting, which dominates the low field magne-\ntoresistance as observed in Refs. 32, 44, and 45. All of the\nZERO-FIELD SPIN SPLITTING AND SPIN LIFETIME\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW B 77, 165335 \u00012008\u0002\n165335-5\nabove methods are based on the assumption that the zero-\nfield spin splitting is dominated by the SIA mechanism. As is\ndiscussed in Sec. III, this cannot always be considered true\nand thus can lead to overestimations of \u0005. More recently, a\nnovel experimental approach for the direct measurement of\nthe Rashba and Dresselhaus spin splittings has been pro-\nposed by Ganichev et al.46 from the angular dependence of\nthe spin-galvanic photocurrent.47 Values for the ratio \u0005 \/\u0004 in\n15 nm InAs \/ InGaAs QWs are estimated as \u000e2.15, which\nagrees with ratios from k \u00b7p calculations in the InGaAs QW\nsystem of \u000e1.85.15 Ratios calculated here for equivalent\nQWs are dependent on well width and carrier density but are\ntypically smaller than those quoted above due to the com-\nparatively large Dresselhaus coefficient \u0003, which enhances \u0004\n\u0001see below\u0002.\nB. Bulk inversion assymetry Coefficients\nThe BIA parameters \u0004 and \u0003 exhibit a relatively weak\nlinear dependence on ns and \r compared to \u0005 for a given\nwell width \u0003demonstrated in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002 for \u2212\u0004\u0001ns\u0002\u0004 consistent\nwith the results of Kainz et al.31 for the AlAs \/GaAs system.\nThe energy eigenvalue \r contains both the confinement en-\nergy E1 and the Fermi energy EF \u0001shown in Fig. 1\u0002 thus, the\ndependence on ns reflects higher order nonparabolicity cor-\nrections with increasing Fermi energy.31 To compare the re-\nsults for different QW widths, \u0004 and \u0003 are plotted as a func-\ntion of W in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002 for a fixed Fermi energy. The\nparameter \u0003 \u0003dotted line Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002\u0004 is observed to increase\nwith well width. For increasing well width, E1 is lowered,\nwhich results in an enhancement of \u0003 and the observed trend.\nThe value of \u0003 for the widest well shows an \u000e30% reduction\nfrom that of the bulk, which is estimated as \u0003bulk\n=646.5 eV \u00c53 at the zone center by directly evaluating Eq.\n\u00019\u0002 with an unstrained energy gap Eg=235.2 meV,35 and as-\nsuming \r=V\u0001z\u0002=0 in the bulk. Reduction from this value is\ndue to the presence of confinement \u0001E1\u0002 and an increased\ndensity of states in the bulk three-dimensional system, which\nlowers the Fermi energy to within a few kT of the band edge\n\u0001taken here as zero\u0002. Hence, for W\u2192\u0014, E1\u21920, the value of\n\u0003 would approach that of the bulk case. It should be men-\ntioned that our bulk estimation of \u0003 is somewhat greater than\nthat estimated from the 16-band k \u00b7p model of Cardona et\nal.48 given as \u0003bulk\n*\n=563.9 eV \u00c53. This variation can be at-\ntributed to the difference in the number of bands accounted\nfor in the models and the uncertainty in the values for the\nparameter B in the expression for \u0003 \u0003Eq. \u00019\u0002\u0004. The parameter\nB is determined either from perturbation theory49 or experi-\nmental measurements of the BIA spin splitting in the bulk\nmaterial.50 The latter is somewhat unreliable, predominantly\ndue to the inherent large effective g* factor in bulk InSb\n\u0001\u000e\u221252\u0002. As a result, the value of B is shown to vary signifi-\ncantly over a range \u221231.4\u0013B\u0013\u221212.6 \u0001eV \u00c52\u0002.35,49,50 The\nvalue of B taken from Ref. 35 is chosen here as it follows the\ntrends of III\u2013V semiconductors.41 A direct comparison of the\nvalues of B taken here and by Cardona et al.48 is not pos-\nsible, since in the 16- \u0001or 14-\u0002 band model \u0003 is no longer\ndirectly proportional to B, but rather the momentum matrix\nelement Q, which couples the \u00158v, \u00157v and \u00158c, \u00157c bands.8,48\nThe results for \u0004 as a function of W exhibit a weak qua-\ndratic behavior, which decreases with increasing well width\nindicated by the solid line in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002. This behavior can be\nqualitatively accounted for by comparison to the 1 \/W2 de-\npendence in the high barrier limit for \u0004 given by Eppenga\nand Schuurmans1 as \u0004\u000f\u0003bulk\u0001\u0016 \/W\u00022, where \u0016 \/W is the\nquantized wave number kz \u0001for the first subband\u0002 in an infi-\nnite well. Although instructive as a qualitative comparison,\nwe find that this approximation overestimates the magnitude\nof \u0004 by a factor of 2 compared with evaluation of Eq. \u00018\u0002\neven for the widest well \u0003see Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002\u0004. This is due to the\nfinite barriers used here and the elevated value of \u0003 in the\nbulk used in the approximation.

The second term in Eq. \u000111\u0002 is formally\nequivalent to \u0003\tkz\n2\u000b. From inspection of the results, we find\nthat the interface term dominates over the field term, as with\n\u0005. However, the second \u0003\tkz\n2\u000b term is dominant overall con-\ntributing to \u000e75% of the total, justifying the approximation\nused by previous authors.27,28,31 The discrepancy seen in Fig.\n3 can be more specifically attributed to interface contribu-\ntions, from which it is apparent that the k-linear BIA term\nhas contributions from both BIA and SIA.1,41,46\nIt is worth mentioning that the underlying barrier asym-\nmetry in these structures, i.e., dVUB\u2212dVLB\u00120, counteracts\nthe direction of the field in the QW, which reduces the asym-\nmetry of the probability densities at the interfaces \u000f\u000bI\n2\n. In-\ntuitively, one would therefore expect the Rashba coefficient\nto be greater in symmetric structures where the upper barrier\nconduction band offset dVUB is reduced \u0001for doping located\nabove the well\u0002. In varying the upper barrier alloy composi-\ntion x, we find that although \u000f\u000bI\n2 does indeed increase as the\nunderlying barrier asymmetry is reduced, the coefficients\nwithin the dominant interface term associated with the top\ninterface, C0\u2212dVUBD0 \u0003see Eq. \u00016\u0002\u0004, which depend on band\nparameters, decrease in such a way as to counteract the ex-\npected behavior. Consequently, for a fixed carrier density, the\nRashba coefficient is found to increase approximately lin-\nearly with asymmetry as show in Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002 for the 20 nm QW\nwhere we have reduced the upper barrier composition from\nIn0.8Al0.2Sb to In0.85Al0.15Sb to match the lower barrier using\ninterpolated band parameters from Ref. 37. The same behav-\nior is seen for different well widths. In contrast to the SIA\ncoupling, we find that \u0003 shows negligible variation with bar-\nrier asymmetry since the contribution to \u0003 from the QW\ndominates over that from the barriers. However, similar to\nthe result for \u0005, \u0004 is also found to linearly increase with\nbarrier asymmetry which, along with the observation of con-\nstant \u0003, is attributed to an increase in \tkz\n2\u000b. These results\nhighlight the importance of heterostucture design for maxi-\nmizing or minimizing \u0005 and \u0004. For maximum \u0005, ns should\nbe maximized for a given W \u0001consistent with the constraint\nof single subband occupation\u0002 with consideration given also\nto the barrier compositions.\nIV.

It can be seen from Eq.\n\u000113\u0002 that when SIA dominates, the usual spin splitting asso-\nciated with the Rashba effect, \t\u000fESIA\u000b=2kF\n\u0005\n, is recovered.\nUsing the SO parameters for kF=1.26\f108 m\u22121, we find\nthat \t\u000fEBIA\u000b\u0001kF\u0002 contributes 14% to the total spin splitting in\nthe 30 nm QW structure rising to 69% in the 15 nm QW, due\nto the relative magnitudes of \u0005 and \u0004 in these structures \u0003see\nFig. 2\u0001a\u0002\u0004. Figure 4\u0001b\u0002 shows the variation of the BIA con-\ntribution to the total spin splitting with carrier density and\nwell width clearly demonstrating that both of these param-\neters have a significant effect in this fraction. Furthermore,\nwe find that the total \u0001average\u0002 spin splitting is greater in the\nnarrow well structures over the range of carrier densities\nconsidered, which for kF=1.26\f108 m\u22121 is calculated as\n\t\u000fEtot\u000b\u0001kF\u0002=1.80 and 1.42 meV for the 15 and 30 nm QWs,\nrespectively. We therefore find, contrary to the results of\nDeng et al.15 for the InAlAs \/ InGaAs system, that in these\nInSb heterostructures the SIA cannot always be considered\nas the dominant mechanism as the BIA contribution is sig-\nnificant and dependent on well width and carrier density.\nThe effect of reducing the asymmetry on the coupling\nparameters \u0005 and \u0004 was discussed in Sec. III. For a 20 nm\nQW, the effect of reducing the upper barrier alloy composi-\ntion from In0.8Al0.2Sb to In0.85Al0.15Sb is manifested in a\n14% reduction in \t\u000fEtot\u000b\u0001kF\u0002 due to the reduced magnitude\nof coupling parameters \u0005 and \u0004, as shown in Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002.\nWe note that the characteristic anisotropy of the BIA spin\nsplitting \u000fEBIA\u0003kF\u0001\u0017\u0002\u0004 \u0001Ref. 1\u0002 exhibits a marked dependence\non the ratio of \u0004 \/\u0003 and kF. For particular values of \u0004 \/\u0003 and\nkF, the anisotropy, defined as \u000fE\u0003100\u0004 \/\u000fE\u0003110\u0004, undergoes a\n\u0016 \/4 phase shift compared to the earlier work of Eppenga and\nSchuurmans1 for \u0003001\u0004 grown GaAs \/AlAs QWs such that\nthe maximum spin splitting is found along the \u0003110\u0004 direction\nand not the \u0003100\u0004 direction. This macroscopic change in an-\nisotropy smoothly occurs, and from analysis of Eq. \u000112\u0002 with\n\u0005=0, it can be shown that the transition in anisotropy occurs\nwhen the condition 4\u0004 \/\u0003kF\n2\n=1 is satisfied, at which point\n\u000fEBIA\u0003kF\u0001\u0017\u0002\u0004 is completely isotropic. When both SIA and\nBIA are present, the total spin splitting will not become iso-\ntropic due to the crossed terms involving \u0005\u0004, \u0005\u0003, and \u0004\u0003,\nwhich appear in Eq. \u000112\u0002. The behavior of \u000fEtot\u0003kF\u0001\u0017\u0002\u0004 be-\ncomes completely symmetric about the \u0003100\u0004 direction at the\ncondition 2\u0004 \/\u0003kF\n2\n=1, where we find for 2\u0004 \/\u0003kF\n2\u00131 the\nminimum spin splitting is found along the \u000311\u00af0\u0004 direction,\ni.e., a \u0016 \/2 phase shift compared to the data presented in Fig.\n4\u0001a\u0002 where 2\u0004 \/\u0003kF\n2\u00121. An optical experiment whereby the\nspin splitting is measured from the side emission in the di-\nrections \u0003110\u0004 and \u000311\u00af0\u0004 in a gated light-emitting diode de-\nvice could, in principle, detect such a change in symmetry\nfrom the photoluminescence or electroluminescence spectra\nwhen the carrier density is varied such that the condition of\n\u0004 \/\u0003=kF\n2 \/2 is traversed. With knowledge of the carrier den-\nsity, such an experiment would yield direct measurement of\nthe ratio \u0004 \/\u0003, which could be compared to the calculations.\nV. SPIN LIFETIME CALCULATIONS\nThe original proposals for the SL-FET consider spin re-\nlaxation only from the k-linear SO terms \u0005 and \u0004 under the\napproximation of low carrier density and a negligible k-cubic\ncontribution \u0001\u0003\u0002 to the Dresselhaus splitting.28 Kainz et al.31\nextended the calculations of Refs. 26\u201328 in the\nAlGaAs \/GaAs and GaAlSb \/ InAs material systems to more\nrealistic carrier densities. When taking into account higher\norder k terms involving \u0003 in the spin lifetime calculation,\nKainz et al.31 observed a carrier density and well width de-\npendence on the spin lifetime, previously overlooked.26,27 In\nthe following, we take these issues into account.\nIn the In1\u2212xAlxSb \/ InSb systems considered, SO param-\neters \u0005 and \u0004 are of opposite sign \u0003shown in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002\u0004.\nFollowing the theoretical results of Averkiev et al.30 for the\nDP mechanism, a maximum in the spin lifetime will occur\nfor spins injected parallel to \u000311\u00af0\u0004.

The lifetime \u00023 is a more ambiguous\nquantity. The approximation of \u00023\u000e\u00021 is made in Ref. 31. A\nrecent study by Orr et al.38 of electron transport in modula-\ntion doped InSb \/ InAlSb QW heterostructures, similar or\nidentical to those described here, demonstrated that for tem-\nperatures below 30 K, carrier mobilities are limited by long-\nrange \u0001small-angle\u0002 remote ionized impurity scattering\n\u0001RIIS\u0002.

As a re-\nsult, we find that \u00023 \/\u00021 typically varies from 0.12 to 0.28 as\nS is reduced from 20 to 5 nm, respectively, over the range of\nkF values considered. For ease of computation, in the follow-\ning calculations of \u0002s\u000311\u00af0\u0004, we use an average value of \u00023 \/\u00021\n=0.2\u0002.\nFrom Eq. \u000114\u0002, it can be seen that for small carrier densi-\nties \u0001ns\u00130.5\f1015 m2\u0002 and\/or small \u0003 such as in wider gap\nmaterials, e.g., GaAs, the kF\n4 and kF\n6 terms become negligible\nand \u0002s\u000311\u00af0\u0004 is dominated by the kF\n2 terms involving only \u0005 and\n\u0004 parameters. This allows \u0002s\u000311\u00af0\u0004 to approach infinity when\n\u0005=\u2212\u0004, as demonstrated in Fig. 5 \u0001solid line\u0002 for \u0003=0.26\u201328\nFor realistic device carrier densities ns\u000e3\f1015 m2, these\nterms are no longer negligible and should be taken into\naccount.31\nIn Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002, we demonstrated that in the single-sided\n\u0001-doped structures considered here, \u0005 is proportional to ns. It\nwas theoretically shown in the AlGaAs \/GaAs and\nAlAs \/ InAs systems31,51 that the spin lifetime can exhibit a\nstrong nonmonotonous behavior with ns \u0003seen from Eq.\n\u000114\u0002\u0004. Experimentally, the sensitivity of the spin lifetime to\nthe carrier density, modulated either via the application of an\nexternal electric field21,43,52 or the doping conditions,53 has\nbeen demonstrated. As a result, for the current structures, it is\nnot correct to reproduce the matching conditions for the SP-\nFET made by Cartoixa et al.26 who assumed a constant car-\nrier density and calculated \u0002s\u000311\u00af0\u0004 as a function \u0004 \/\u0005 with \u0005 as\na free variable. However, modulation of \u0005 while maintaining\na constant carrier density can be achieved by the use of a\nsecond \u201cback\u201d gate and has been experimentally demon-\nstrated in the work of Nitta et al.7 For this reason, we sepa-\nrately consider the two approaches of \u0001i\u0002 constant carrier\ndensity, where we assume only \u0005 as a free variable for a\ngiven kF in order to calculate \u0002s\u000311\u00af0\u0004 as a function of \u0004 \/\u0005 and\n\u0001ii\u0002 varying carrier density, combining all of the results of \u0005,\n\u0004, and \u0003 from the calculations in Sec.

SO parameters used in the cal-\nculations are \u0004=0.0768 and 0.0314 eV \u00c5, and \u0003=385 and\n442 eV \u00c53 for the 15 and 30 nm QW calculations, respec-\ntively. From Fig. 5, it is clear that by including terms involv-\ning \u0003, the spin lifetime no longer approaches infinity at the\nconditions given in Eqs. \u000115a\u0002 and \u000115b\u0002 but is substantially\nsuppressed to a finite value. Substitution of Eq. \u000115a\u0002 into\nEq. \u000114\u0002 yields a maximum spin lifetime of\n\u0002\ns\u000311\u00af0\u0004\nmax\n=\n\b2\n2\u00021\n16\nkF\n6\u00032\u0001\u00023\/\u00021\u0002\n. \u000116\u0002\nThis observation is consistent with a qualitative picture of\nthe spin configuration in the 2DEG plane. In the idealized\ncase of \u0005=\u2212\u0004 \u0001\u0003=0\u0002, the component along \u000311\u00af0\u0004 of an in-\njected spin is always parallel to the direction of \u0001\u0001k\u0005\u0002, de-\nnoted by \u0017eff\u0003\u0001\u0001k\u0005\u0002\u0004, which takes the two directions \u00031\u00af10\u0004\nand \u000311\u00af0\u0004 dependent on the direction of in plane momentum\n\u0017\u0001k\n\u0002. With the inclusion of \u0003k3 terms in \u0002s\u000311\u00af0\u0004, the orienta-\ntion of \u0001\u0001k\u0005\u0002 changes with \u0017\u0001k\n\u0002, even when the SIA and\nBIA couplings are balanced according to Eqs. \u000115a\u0002 and\n\u000115b\u0002. Thus, the component of spin is not always aligned\nwith \u0001\u0001k\u0005\u0002 and a finite spin relaxation will result.

Surprisingly, the width of the peak\nin \u0002s\u000311\u00af0\u0004 for the 30 nm QW is significantly broadened. This\nbroadening is attributed to the reduced magnitude of the ratio\n\u0004 \/\u0003 in this structure, which enhances the significance of the\n\u0003 terms. Perhaps, more importantly from a device perspec-\ntive is that because of the broadening in \u0002s\u000311\u00af0\u0004, the potential\ncurrent modulation from the \u201con\u201d to \u201coff\u201d states of this struc-\nture from the tuning of \u0005 would be greatly reduced from that\nof a narrower well structure. A significant peak in \u0002s\u000311\u00af0\u0004 for\nthe 30 nm well is recovered only for very small ns, approach-\ning the scenario of the original proposals of the SL-FET\nwhere \u0003 is neglected.\nThe effect of kF, and hence ns, on the variation of \u0002s\u000311\u00af0\u0004\nwith \u0004 \/\u0005 for the 15 nm QW is indicated by the dashed and\ncrossed-dashed lines in Fig. 5 for kF=1.26 and 0.81\n\f108 m\u22121, respectively \u0001each data set is generated using dif-\nferent values of \u0004 and \u0003 according to the k \u00b7p calculations for\nthe different ns\u0002. The trend of the data agrees with the ap-\nproximation used by Averkiev and Golub,28 whereby as kF is\nreduced the spin lifetime behavior approaches that of the\ncase of taking \u0003=0 \u0001indicated by the solid line in Fig. 5\u0002,\nwith an increasing \u0002\ns\u000311\u00af0\u0004\nmax\n. These results demonstrate the sen-\nsitivity of the position and magnitude of the maximum spin\nlifetime to kF \u0001and ns\u0002, as is evident from the kF\n2 and kF\n6\ndependences in Eqs. \u000115a\u0002, \u000115b\u0002, and \u000116\u0002 respectively.\nEquation \u000116\u0002 shows that \u0002\ns\u000311\u00af0\u0004\nmax is also sensitive to the\nratio of lifetimes \u00023 \/\u00021. The accuracy of \u00023 \/\u00021 must be kept\nin mind when considering the limit of Eq. \u000116\u0002 \u0001i.e., here we\nhave used the RIIS theory\u0002; however, it is apparent from the\napproach of Ref. 30 that a small ratio \u00023 \/\u00021\u00021 \u0001which can\nbe generated from remote doping\u2014producing small-angle\nscattering\u0002 is desirable for large \u0002\ns\u000311\u00af0\u0004\nmax\n.\nB. Results for varying carrier density\nIn the structures studied here, tuning \u0005 with an external\nfield also changes the carrier density. Highlighted in Sec. III,\nthe position of the \u0001 doping in the growth order with respect\nto the QW is now of relevance as this determines the depen-\ndence of \u0005 on gate bias. The following results represent the\ncalculations of \u0002s\u000311\u00af0\u0004 using all three SO parameters and car-\nrier densities associated with each heterostructure. For RIIS\nlimited transport lifetimes, \u0007 explicitly varies with spacer\nthickness and doping density.38 We address this issue by cal-\nculating the product \u0002s\u000311\u00af0\u0004\u0007 for each well width as shown in\nFig. 6\u0001a\u0002, thus removing the dependence of \u0007 from the re-\nsults. We emphasize that the results presented here are for\nsolutions at zero bias so that the carrier density is varied\nthrough the doping conditions and not through an external\nfield.\nThe results of \u0002s\u000311\u00af0\u0004\u0007 for the various well widths are\npresented in Fig. 6\u0001a\u0002. Data for the 15, 20, and 25 nm QW\nstructures exhibit a strong nonmonotonic behavior at moder-\nate ns, as described in Refs. 31 and 51. The lines in Fig. 6\u0001a\u0002\nare guide to the eyes, emphasizing the turning point in the\ndata, indicating that the SIA and BIA induced couplings have\nbeen balanced over the carrier density range considered\u2014\nequivalent to the peaks seen in Fig. 5 \u0003although the condition\nfor maximum lifetime is now more complicated than that of\nEq. \u000115a\u0002 as \u0005, \u0004, and \u0003 are a function of ns\u0004. In Fig. 6\u0001b\u0002,\nthe spin relaxation rate \u0001\u0002s\u000311\u00af0\u0004\u0007\u0002\u22121 is plotted against carrier\ndensity in order to elucidate the separate contributions from\nthe terms proportional to ns, ns\n2\n, and ns\n3 in Eq. \u000114\u0002. It can be\nseen that the turning point observed in \u0002s\u000311\u00af0\u0004\u0007 is reflected as\na minimum in \u0001\u0002s\u000311\u00af0\u0004\u0007\u0002\u22121, which resuls from the competition\nbetween the three terms. The ns\n2 term has negative polarity\nover the range of carrier density where \u0004\u0012\u0005. The magni-\ntudes of \u0005 and \u0004 are comparable in the 15, 20, and 25 nm\nQW structures at moderate ns facilitating the observed peak\nin the spin lifetime, although notably, a maximum spin life-\ntime is observed at lower ns than the point at which \u0005=\u2212\u0004\n\u0003see Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002\u0004 due to the influence of \u0003. Accordingly, from\nthe above observation, it can be inferred that a turnover in\n\u0002s\u000311\u00af0\u0004\u0007 for the widest well is achieve for smaller ns than is\nconsidered here.

Although the finer\nstructure of the spin lifetime characteristics is dependent on\nall three SO parameters and the resulting effective magnetic\nfield, we attribute this trend of spin lifetime on well width\nprimarily to the smaller Dresselhaus parameter \u0003 present in\nthe narrow wells. This parameter is found to have a signifi-\ncant influence on the spin lifetime maximum for both re-\ngimes of fixed and varying ns.\nIn agreement with the results of Kainz et al.,31 we find\nthat spins injected parallel to the \u0003001\u0004 and \u0003110\u0004 directions\nexperience approximately equal spin relaxation rates, which\nare typically over an order of magnitude greater than those in\nthe \u000311\u00af0\u0004 direction.

SUMMARY\nUsing an established eight-band k \u00b7p formalism,15 we\nhave calculated the SO coupling parameters for the conduc-\ntion band in n-InSb \/ In1\u2212xAlxSb QWs for a range of well\nwidths and doping conditions. In contrast to previous\nstudies,4,41 we find that in the realistic heterostructure de-\nsigns considered here, for a given ns, the Rashba parameter \u0005\nis largest in wide well structures. We attribute this result to\nthe reduced barrier alloy composition compared to that of the\nnarrow wells. This leads to greater penetration of the wave\nfunction into the barriers and asymmetry of the probability\ndensities at the interfaces \u000f\u000bI\n2\n, albeit with the caveat of a\nreduced range of ns over which only the first subband is\noccupied. Thus, we find that the largest Rashba coefficients\ncan be achieved at higher carrier densities in narrow well\n\u000115 nm\u0002 structures. We have demonstrated that calculation of\nthe BIA parameter \u0004 from the infinite well approximation\ncan significantly overestimate the magnitude of \u0004 whereas\nthe more commonly employed approximation of \u0004=\u0003\tkz\n2\u000b\naccounts for only \u000e75% of the total magnitude since the\ninterface contributions are neglected. We show that the BIA\ncontribution, to the spin splitting is significant and in narrow\nwells can exceed that of the SIA contribution, which is\nstrongly dependent on W and ns. We predict that under cer-\ntain conditions \u000fEtot\u0003kF\u0001\u0017\u0002\u0004 can exhibit a macroscopic \u0016 \/2\nchange in direction of momentum, which gives minimum\nspin splitting. Experiments to verify this are suggested,\nwhich would yield quantitative information of the spin split-\nting. Spin lifetimes have been calculated for components of\nspin parallel to the \u000311\u00af0\u0004 direction following the work of\nAverkiev et al.30 finding good qualitative agreement with the\nresults of Kainz et al.31 for the InAs and GaAs QW systems.\nWe successfully reproduce the results for \u0002s\u000311\u00af0\u0004\u0007 from the\nprecession of spins about the effective magnetic field in-\nferred from the k \u00b7p theory,15 highlighting a discrepancy in\nthe kF\n6 term from the theory of Averkiev et al.30 While we\nshow that over the range of typical realistic carrier densities\nstudied here, \u0002s\u000311\u00af0\u0004\u0007 is largest in the narrower QW, for low\ncarrier densities large spin lifetimes are achieved in wider\nwell structures. We have demonstrated that the inherently\nlarge SO coupling in the InSb \/ InAlSb system compared to\nother materials increases the significance of the higher order\nterms in the expressions for spin lifetime, which as a result\nhas considerable effect on the operating conditions of the\nSL-FET and the maximum achievable spin lifetime. The re-\nsults of the calculations presented give important insight into\nthe engineering of heterostructures for spintronic applica-\ntions.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank C. R.
