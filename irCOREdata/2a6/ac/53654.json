Here we describe a new standard, developed by a large 181 \nand diverse community of researchers, to describe one of the most abundant and useful 182 \ntypes of sequence data \u2013 that of marker gene data sets. 183 \n 184 \nThe wealth of marker gene data sets 185 \nThe adoption of phylogenetic marker genes as molecular proxies for tracking and 186 \ncataloguing the diversity of microorganisms has revolutionized the way we view the 187 \nbiological world, and provided us with insights into how life has evolved and how 188 \ndifferent organisms are genetically related to each other. In the 1970s, studies of small 189 \nsubunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes from environmental samples led to the 190 \ndiscovery of the domain Archaea 4 and to the proposal for a three domain classification of 191 \nlife 5. Following Darwin\u2019s insight that all life is related, SSU rRNA gene surveys allow 192 \norganisms from any communities, no matter how diverse, to be compared using the same 193 \nuniversal phylogenetic tree. This rRNA gene-based molecular approach to characterizing 194 \nnatural communities of organisms provided, for the first time, culture-independent access 195 \nto the diversity and distribution of microorganisms \u2018in situ\u2019. As a result, we are now 196 \nacutely aware that the vast majority (90-99%) of microorganisms have evaded isolation 197 \nusing existing cultivation methods 6-8.   198 \n 11\nOver the past three decades, the 16S rRNA, 18S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer 199 \ngene sequences (ITS) from Bacteria, Archaea, and microbial Eukaryotes have provided 200 \ndeep insights into the topology of the tree of life 9-12 and the composition of communities 201 \nof organisms that live in diverse environments, which range from deep sea hydrothermal 202 \nvents to ice sheets in the Arctic 13-27.  203 \nNumerous other phylogenetic marker genes have also proven useful 28: Currently, around 204 \n40 such phylogenetic marker genes are in wide use, representing well-conserved, 205 \nhousekeeping genes that include initiation factors, for example, RNA polymerase 206 \nsubunits (rpoB), DNA gyrases (gyrB), DNA recombination and repair proteins (recA) and 207 \nheat shock proteins (HSP70) 10,29. Combinations of these genes can also be used in multi-208 \nlocus sequence typing (MLST) approaches, increasing phylogenetic resolution and 209 \ndifferentiating between closely related species of the same genus 30,31. Marker genes can 210 \nalso reveal key metabolic functions rather than phylogeny; examples include nitrogen 211 \ncycling (amoA, nifH, ntcA) 32,33, sulfate reduction (dsrAB) 34 or phosphorus metabolism 212 \n(phnA, phnI, phnJ) 35-37.  213 \nThe molecular approach has been extended beyond microorganisms by its application to 214 \nphylogeny and systematics of higher Eukaryotes. The Barcode of Life Initiative (BOLI) 215 \nadapted the molecular approach with the standardized use of a specific gene sequence: 216 \nthe 680 base-pair region of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI), as a means of 217 \nrapid species identification and discrimination 38.  218 \nIn this paper we collectively define all of these different phylogenetic and functional 219 \ngenes (or gene fragments) as \u2018marker genes\u2019 as they are used to profile natural genetic 220 \ndiversity across the Tree of Life, and argue that a small amount of additional effort 221 \n 12\ninvested in describing them with specific guidelines in our public databases will 222 \nrevolutionize the types of studies that can be performed with these large data resources. 223 \nThis effort is timely, given the need to determine how climate change and various other 224 \nanthropogenic perturbations of our biosphere are affecting biodiversity, and how marked 225 \nchanges in our cultural traditions and lifestyles are affecting human microbial ecology.  226 \n 227 \nThe collective value of marker gene sequences 228 \nThe quality and quantity of marker gene sequence data used to make phylogenetic 229 \nassignments, to infer metabolic traits, to unravel succession as a function of the 230 \nenvironment, and to assess biogeographic distributions continues to increase rapidly due 231 \nto the availability of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Clearly, specific 232 \nassociations of microbial dynamics with the environment and geography were achieved 233 \nfor cultured microorganisms long before the advent of metagenomics and NGS 234 \ntechnologies 39-42. However, with the new powerful technologies at our service, it is 235 \npossible to unravel the diversity and function of the uncultured majority as well as to 236 \nstudy increasingly complex and\/or divergent ecosystems. For example, a clear correlation 237 \nbetween phylogenetic similarity and similar living conditions was observed using data in 238 \navailable SSU sequence repositories and culture collections 43. In addition, two separate 239 \nglobal environmental studies established a latitudinal diversity gradient for marine 240 \nBacteria 44,45. Furthermore, it was shown that temporally-driven environmental factors, 241 \nsuch as temperature and nutrients, correlate with local seasonal succession of marine 242 \nmicrobial communities 46. In a cross-habitat study, salinity and pH have been suggested 243 \nto influence bacterial and archaeal community compositions, respectively 47,48. In the 244 \n 13\nhuman body, it has been suggested that the microbial community composition varies 245 \nsystematically across body habitats, individuals and time 49. A recent study combined 246 \nhabitat type and 16S rRNA based operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in a graph-247 \ntheoretic approach to demonstrate that different habitats harbor unique assemblages of 248 \nco-occurring microorganisms 50. For multicellular organisms, modeling approaches to 249 \npredict global distributions of marine species have been applied in projects such as 250 \nAquaMaps 51. Combination of such efforts with the potential of COI to unveil historical 251 \nprocesses may successfully be applied in determining factors responsible for the 252 \ncontemporary geographic distributions of these organisms 52.  253 \nUnfortunately, only a few of these large-scale environmental surveys of biodiversity and 254 \nbiogeography have relied on existing marker gene sequence data sets found in the public 255 \ndatabases 43,47,50,53. Mainly due to the lack of specific guidelines, most marker gene 256 \nsequences in databases are sparsely annotated with the information that would be 257 \nrequired to underpin data integration, comparative studies, and knowledge generation. 258 \nEven with complex keyword searches, it is currently impossible to reliably retrieve 259 \nmarker gene sequences that have originated from certain environments or particular 260 \nlocations on Earth; for example, all sequences from \u2018soil\u2019 or \u2018freshwater lakes\u2019 in a 261 \ncertain region of the world. 262 \nIn human health and the study of epidemiology, it would also be desirable to have 263 \nadditional contextual data to help monitor the origins and regional spreading of 264 \npandemics 54 and study the variation of the human microbiota 55-57. Combining clinical 265 \nand environmental datasets could provide new insight into where the trillions of bacteria 266 \nthat inhabit our body come from, and could help predict new outbreaks of disease or 267 \n 14\nassist in understanding the normal ecology of occasional pathogens. Already known 268 \ncorrelations of some microbial taxa in with different environmental conditions, such as 269 \ndepth in the marine environment 58,59, and pH in the soil environment 60, can be extended 270 \nfurther. Careful integration of bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic SSU and LSU rRNA 271 \nsequence data with their geographical and environmental context can shed light on new 272 \nmechanisms by which organisms from these three domains interact.  273 \n 274 \nThe MIENS Specification 275 \nFew of the publicly available marker gene datasets contain contextual information about 276 \nthe environment such as geographic location, sampling time, habitat, or about 277 \nexperimental procedures used to obtain the DNA sequences. Such information may or 278 \nmay not be available in associated publications but the \u2018costs\u2019 in terms of time and energy 279 \nto collect this by hand or with semi-automated systems from the literature are prohibitive 280 \n61. Public databases of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration 281 \n(INSDC; comprised of DDBJ (DNA Data Bank of Japan), ENA (European Nucleotide 282 \nArchive), and GenBank; http:\/\/www.insdc.org) depend on information submitted by 283 \nauthors to enrich the value of these sequences. We argue that the only way to change the 284 \ncurrent practice is to establish a standard of reporting that requires contextual data to be 285 \ndeposited at the time of sequence submission 3. The adoption of such a standard would 286 \nelevate the quality, accessibility, and utility of information that can be collected from 287 \nINSDC.   288 \nHere we present a reporting guideline for marker genes, MIENS (Minimum Information 289 \nabout an ENvironmental Sequence), which is based on the \u201cMinimum Information about 290 \n 15\na (Meta) Genome Sequence\u201d (MIGS\/MIMS) specification issued by the Genomic 291 \nStandards Consortium (GSC) 62.  Since its proposal at the sixth GSC meeting in 2008 63, 292 \nthe consortium has been working to build a consensus on an ideal and minimum set of 293 \ncontextual data that should be reported for marker genes retrieved from the environment. 294 \nThe proposed MIENS standard (Table 1) extends the MIGS\/MIMS specification for 295 \ngenomes and metagenomes by adding two new report types, a \u201cMIENS-survey\u201d and a 296 \n\u201cMIENS-culture\u201d, the former being the checklist of choice for uncultured diversity 297 \nmarker gene surveys, the latter designed for marker gene sequences obtained from 298 \ncultured organisms or any material identifiable via voucher specimens.  299 \nA specific focus of the extended requirements is the sets of measurements and 300 \nobservations describing particular habitats, termed \u2018environmental packages\u2019.   301 \nThe MIENS checklist adopts and incorporates the standards being developed by the 302 \nConsortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL) (http:\/\/www.barcoding.si.edu\/PDF\/ 303 \nDWG_data_standards-Final.pdf). Therefore, the specification can be universally applied 304 \nto any marker gene, from SSU rRNA to COI, to cultured and uncultured organisms, to all 305 \ntaxa and to studies ranging from single individuals to complex communities.  306 \nThe MIENS checklist was developed by collating information from several sources and 307 \nevaluating it in the framework of the existing MIGS\/MIMS specification. These include 308 \nfour independent community-led surveys, examination of the parameters reported in 309 \npublished studies, and examination of compliance with optional features in INSDC 310 \ndocuments. The overall goal of these activities was to design the backbone of the MIENS 311 \nspecification that describes the most important aspects of marker gene contextual data, 312 \nand that would encourage users to deposit this contextual data in a standardized fashion.  313 \n 16\nResults of community-led surveys 314 \nCommunity surveys are an excellent way to determine researcher preferences for core 315 \ndescriptors. To date, there have been four online surveys about descriptors for marker 316 \ngenes. In the same manner as the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute\u2019s (DOE-317 \nJGI) user survey focusing on general descriptor contextual data for marker genes in 2005, 318 \nthe Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) 64,65, SILVA 66 and the Terragenome Consortium 319 \n67 conducted three more user surveys focusing on prevalent habitats for rRNA gene 320 \nsurveys, general descriptor contextual data for rRNA gene sequences and soil 321 \nmetagenome project contextual data, respectively (supplementary information 1). 322 \nAdditionally, following a special session during the 2005 International Census of Marine 323 \nMicrobes (ICoMM), an extensive set of contextual data items were selected, and were 324 \nanalyzed along with survey results. 325 \nThe results of these user surveys provided valuable insights into community requests for 326 \ncontextual data items to be included in the MIENS specification and the main habitats 327 \nconstituting the environmental packages. 328 \n 329 \nSurvey of published parameters 330 \nWe reviewed published rRNA gene studies, retrieved via SILVA and the ICoMM 331 \ndatabase MICROBIS (The Microbial Oceanic Biogeographic Information System) 332 \n(http:\/\/icomm.mbl.edu\/microbis) to further supplement contextual data items that are 333 \nincluded in the respective environmental packages. In total, thirty-nine publications from 334 \nSILVA; including twenty-three publications with more than 500 sequences, and thirteen 335 \nothers retrieved with habitat-specific study queries; and over 40 ICoMM projects were 336 \n 17\nscanned for contextual data items to constitute the core of the environmental package 337 \nsub-tables (supplementary information 1).  338 \n 339 \nSurvey of INSDC source feature qualifiers 340 \nAs a final analysis step, we surveyed usage statistics of INSDC source feature key 341 \nqualifier values of rRNA gene sequences contained in SILVA (supplementary 342 \ninformation 1). Most striking of these results is that less than 10% of the 1.2 million 16S 343 \nrRNA gene sequences (SILVA release 100) were associated with even basic information 344 \nsuch as latitude\/longitude, collection date or PCR primers. 345 \n 346 \nThe MIENS checklist in full 347 \nThe MIENS specification provides users with an \u2018electronic laboratory notebook\u2019 348 \ncontaining core contextual data items required for consistent reporting of marker gene 349 \ninvestigations. A number of experts in a wide array of topics, guided by a solid 350 \nrationalization procedure at each step along the way, led the development of these 351 \ncontextual data items.  352 \nProject details are hosted in the \u2018Investigation\u2019 section of MIENS, facilitating access to 353 \nthe outline of contextual data of a marker gene survey. The \u2018Environment\u2019 section 354 \nprovides the geospatial, temporal and environmental context. Fourteen \u2018environmental-355 \npackages\u2019 were developed, with the assistance from user surveys, publication reviews and 356 \nexpert communities working on their respective environments, and were integrated into 357 \nthe \u2018MIMS\/MIENS extension\u2019 section. These packages provide a wealth of 358 \nenvironmental and epidemiological contextual data fields for a complete description of 359 \n 18\nsampling environments (supplementary information 2). Researchers within The Human 360 \nMicrobiome Project 68 contributed the host associated and all human packages. The 361 \nTerragenome Consortium contributed sediment and soil packages. Finally, ICoMM, 362 \nMicrobial Inventory Research Across Diverse Aquatic Long Term Ecological Research 363 \nSites (MIRADA-LTERS), and the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology 364 \ncontributed the water package. The MIENS working group developed the remaining 365 \npackages (air, microbial mat\/biofilm, miscellaneous natural or artificial environment, 366 \nplant-associated, and wastewater\/sludge). The package names describe high-level habitat 367 \nterms in order to be exhaustive. The miscellaneous natural or artificial environment 368 \npackage contains a generic set of parameters, and is included for any other habitat that 369 \ndoes not fall into the other thirteen categories. Whenever needed, multiple packages may 370 \nbe used for the description of the environment. 371 \nThe MIGS\/MIMS specifications are applicable to MIENS with respect to the nucleic acid 372 \nsequence source and sequencing contextual data, but have been complemented with 373 \nfurther experimental contextual data such as PCR primers and conditions, or target 374 \ngene\/locus. 375 \nFor clarity and ease of use, all items within the MIENS specification are presented with a 376 \nvalue syntax description, as well as a clear definition of the item. Whenever terms from a 377 \nspecific ontology are required as the value of an item, these terms can be readily found in 378 \nthe respective ontology browsers, which are linked by URLs in the item definition. 379 \nAlthough this version of the MIENS specification does not contain unit specifications, we 380 \nrecommend all units to be chosen from and follow the International System of Units (SI) 381 \nrecommendations. In addition, we strongly urge the community to provide feedback 382 \n 19\nregarding the best unit recommendations for given parameters. To facilitate comparative 383 \nstudies, unit standardization across data sets will be vital in future versions of MIENS.  384 \n 385 \nAccessing the MIGS\/MIMS\/MIENS checklists 386 \nThe MIGS\/MIMS\/MIENS checklists are maintained in a relational database system on 387 \nbehalf of the GSC community. This provides a secure and stable mechanism for updating 388 \nthe checklist suite and versioning. An excel version of the checklist is also provided to 389 \nthe community on the GSC web site at: http:\/\/gensc.org\/gc_wiki\/index.php\/MIENS. The 390 \nchecklist is updated on the GSC web site as development work is carried out on the 391 \ndatabase end. In the future, we plan to develop programmatic access to this database in 392 \norder to allow automatic retrieval of the latest version of each checklist for INSDC 393 \ndatabases and for GSC community resources. Moreover, the Genomic Contextual Data 394 \nMarkup Language (GCDML) is a reference implementation of the MIGS\/MIMS\/MIENS 395 \nchecklists by the GSC. It is based on the XML Schema technology and thus serves as an 396 \ninteroperable data exchange format for Web Service based infrastructures 69. 397 \n 398 \nMIENS Adoption by Major Database and Informatics Resources 399 \nA variety of efforts are under way to aid sequence submitters in compliance. In the past, 400 \nthe INSDC has issued a reserved \u2018BARCODE\u2019 keyword for the CBOL 70,71. Following 401 \nthis model, the INSDC has recently recognized the GSC as an authority for the 402 \nMIGS\/MIMS\/MIENS standards and issued it with an official keyword within INSDC 403 \nnucleotide sequence records 72. This greatly facilitates automatic validation of the 404 \nsubmitted contextual data and provides support for datasets compliant with previous 405 \n 20\nversions by including the checklist version in the keyword. 406 \nGenBank accepts MIENS metadata in tabular format using the sequin and tbl2asn 407 \nsubmission tools, validates MIENS compliance, and reports the MIENS fields in the 408 \nstructured comment block. The ENA Webin submission system provides prepared web 409 \nforms for the submission of MIENS compliant data; it presents all of the appropriate 410 \nfields with descriptions, explanations and examples, in addition to validation of the data 411 \nentered in the forms. An example of a tool that can aid in submission via Sequin or 412 \nWebin systems is MetaBar 73, a spreadsheet and web-based software tool designed to 413 \nassist users in the consistent acquisition, electronic storage and submission of contextual 414 \ndata associated with their samples in compliance with the MIGS\/MIMS\/MIENS 415 \nspecifications. 416 \nThe next-generation Sequence Read Archive (SRA) collects and displays MIENS 417 \ncompliant metadata in the sample and experiment objects. There are several tools that are 418 \nalready available or under development to assist users in SRA submissions. The myRDP 419 \nSRA PrepKit allows users to prepare and edit their submissions of reads generated from 420 \nultra-high-throughput sequencing technologies. A set of suggested attributes in the data 421 \nforms assist researchers in providing metadata conforming to the MIMS and MIENS 422 \nspecifications. The Investigation\/Study\/Assay (ISA) Infrastructure is a flexible, freely 423 \navailable software suite that assists in the curation, reporting, and local management of 424 \nexperimental metadata from studies employing one or a combination of technologies, 425 \nincluding high-throughput sequencing. Specific ISA configurations (available from 426 \nhttp:\/\/gensc.org\/gc_wiki\/index.php\/Adopters#ISA_infrastructure) have been developed to 427 \nensure MIENS compliance by providing templates and validation capability while 428 \n 21\nanother tool, ISAconverter, produces SRA.xml documents, thereby facilitating 429 \nsubmission to the SRA repository 74. 430 \nThe SILVA, RDP, Greengenes and the ICoMM resources have participated in the 431 \ndevelopment of MIENS, and are now taking the standardization one step further by 432 \nestablishing tools and resources to aid in compliance. 433 \nFurther detailed guidance for submission processes can be found under the respective 434 \nwiki pages (http:\/\/gensc.org\/gc_wiki\/index.php\/MIENS) of the MIENS standard. 435 \n 436 \nExamples of MIENS compliant datasets 437 \nSeveral MIENS compliant reports are included in the supplementary information 3. 438 \nThese include; a 16S rRNA gene survey from samples obtained in the North Atlantic, an 439 \n18S pyrotag study of anaerobic protists in the permanently anoxic basin of the North Sea, 440 \na pmoA survey from desert soils of Negev Desert, Israel, a dsrAB survey from marine 441 \nsediments from the Gulf of Mexico, and finally a 16S pyrotag study of bacterial diversity 442 \nin the Western English Channel (publicly accessible via SRA study accession number 443 \nSRP001108). Two further MIENS compliant 16S submissions are available in INSDC 444 \nunder the accession numbers GU949561.1 and GU949562.1. 445 \n 446 \nMIENS \u2013 a \u2018living standard\u2019 447 \nMIENS, as well as MIGS\/MIMS, are \u2018living checklists\u2019 and not final specifications. 448 \nTherefore, further developments, extensions, and enhancements will be recognized, and 449 \nimproved versions of the checklists, if necessitated, will be released annually, while 450 \npreserving the validity of former versions. A public issue tracking system, which can be 451 \n 22\nreached via http:\/\/mixs.gensc.org\/, is set up to track changes and accomplish feature 452 \nrequests. The final decisions about their implementation will be concluded by the MIENS 453 \nworking group. 454 \n 455 \nConclusions and Call for Action 456 \nThe GSC is an international working body with a stated mission of working towards 457 \nricher descriptions of our complete collection of genomes and metagenomes. With the 458 \ndevelopment of the MIENS specification, this mission has been extended to marker gene 459 \nsequences as well. The GSC is an open initiative that welcomes the participation of the 460 \nwider community. This includes an open call to contribute to refinements of the MIENS 461 \nspecification or its implementation.  462 \nThe adoption of the MIENS standard by major data providers and organizations as well 463 \nas the three primary public sequence data repositories (INSDC) with an active poll for 464 \nMIENS compliant data underlines and seconds the efforts to contextually enrich our 465 \nmarker gene collection, and complements the recent efforts to contextually enrich other 466 \n(meta) omics data. The MIENS checklist has been developed to the point that it is ready 467 \nto be used in the publication of sequences. A defined procedure for requesting new 468 \nfeatures and the stable release cycles will facilitate implementation of the standard across 469 \nthe community. Widespread compliance among authors, adoption by journals and use by 470 \ninformatics resources will vastly improve our collective ability to mine and integrate 471 \ninvaluable sequence data collections for knowledge and application driven research. In 472 \nparticular, the ability to combine microbial community samples collected from any 473 \nsource, using the universal Tree of Life as a yardstick to compare even the most diverse 474 \n 23\ncommunities, should provide new insights into the dynamic spatial and temporal 475 \ndistribution of microbial life on our planet and even on our own bodies. 476 \n 24\nReferences 477 \n1 Community cleverness required.
