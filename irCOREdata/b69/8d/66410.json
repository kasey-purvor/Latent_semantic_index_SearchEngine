A key test of this hypothesis\nis that superclusters of galaxies in the process of formation should\ngenerate systematic infall of other galaxies. This would be evident\nin the pattern of recessional velocities, causing an anisotropy in the\ninferred spatial clustering of galaxies. Here we report a precise\nmeasurement of this clustering, using the redshifts of more than\n141,000 galaxies from the two-degree-field galaxy redshift survey.\nWe determine the parameter \u03b2 \u2261\u21260.6\/b = 0.43\u00b10.07, where \u2126 is the\ntotal mass-density parameter and b is a measure of the \u2018bias\u2019 of the\nluminous galaxies in the survey. Combined with the anisotropy of\nthe cosmic microwave background, our results favour a low-density\nuniverse with \u2126 \u2243 0.3.\n1\nHubble showed in 1934 that the pattern of galaxies on the sky is non-random1, and\nsuccessive years have seen ever more ambitious attempts to map the distribution of\nvisible matter on cosmological scales. In order to obtain a three-dimensional picture,\nredshift surveys use Hubble\u2019s law, v = H0r, to infer approximate radial distances to a\nset of galaxies. The first major surveys of this sort took place in the early 1980s2,3,4,5,\nand were limited to a few thousand redshifts, owing to the limited speed of single-object\nspectroscopy. In the 1990s, redshift surveys were extended to much larger volumes by\na \u2018sparse sampling\u2019 strategy6. These studies7,8 established that the universe was close\nto uniform on scales above about 100h\u22121 Mpc (h \u2261 H0\/100 km s\n\u22121Mpc\u22121), but with a\ncomplex nonlinear supercluster network of walls, filaments and voids on smaller scales.\nThe origin of this large-scale structure is one of the key issues in cosmology. A\nplausible assumption is that structure grows via gravitational collapse of density fluc-\ntuations that are small at early times \u2013 but it is vital to test this idea. One important\nsignature of gravitational instability is that collapsing structures should generate \u2018pecu-\nliar\u2019 velocities, \u03b4v, which distort the uniform Hubble expansion. We measure a redshift,\nz, which combines Hubble\u2019s law with the radial component of these peculiar velocities:\ncz \u2243 H0r+\u03b4v \u00b7 r\u02c6. The apparent density field seen in a redshift survey is thus not a true\nthree-dimensional picture, but this can be turned to our advantage. The redshift-space\ndistortions have a characteristic form, whose detection can both verify the general idea\nthat structure forms by gravitational instability, and also measure the density of the\nuniverse. The present paper presents measurements of this effect, based on a new large\nredshift survey.\nThe 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey\nNew-generation large redshift surveys are made feasible by multiplexed fibre-optic spec-\ntroscopy, and the most advanced facility of this sort is the 2-degree Field, mounted\nat the prime focus of the Anglo-Australian Telescope9,10, which allows 400 spectra to\nbe measured simultaneously. The 2dFGRS11,12 was designed to use this instrument\nto measure the redshifts of 250,000 galaxies, to a blue magnitude limit of bJ = 19.45\n(corrected for extinction by dust in the Milky Way). The galaxies were selected from\nan updated version of the APM catalogue13, which is based on scans of photographic\nplates taken with the UK Schmidt Telescope. Survey observations began in 1998, and\nshould finish at the end of 2001. At the time of writing, redshifts have been obtained for\n141,402 galaxies. The sky coverage of the 2dFGRS consists of strips in the Northern and\nSouthern Galactic Poles (75\u25e6\u00d77.5\u25e6 in the NGP; 75\u25e6\u00d715\u25e6 in the SGP), plus a number of\noutlying random fields. Coverage is now sufficiently extensive that near-complete thin\nslices through the galaxy distribution may be constructed, as shown in Fig. 1. This\nimage illustrates well the median depth of the survey: approximately z = 0.11. Beyond\nthis point, the survey is sensitive only to the more luminous galaxies, and the comov-\ning density falls rapidly. Nevertheless, the survey volume (including other regions not\nshown) is more than adequate for an accurate determination of the statistical properties\nof galaxy clustering.\nGalaxy correlations in redshift space\nThe simplest statistical indicator of peculiar velocities in cosmological structure is the\ntwo-point correlation function, \u03be(\u03c3, \u03c0). This measures the excess probability over ran-\ndom of finding a pair of galaxies with a transverse separation \u03c3 and a line-of-sight sepa-\nration \u03c0. In an isotropic universe, this function should be independent of direction, but\n2\nFigure 1 The distribution of galaxies in part of the 2dFGRS, drawn from a\ntotal of 141,402 galaxies: the slices are 4\u25e6 thick, centred at declination \u22122.5\u25e6 in\nthe NGP (left) and \u221227.5\u25e6 in the SGP (right). Not all 2dF fields within the slice\nhave been observed at this stage, hence there are weak variations of the density\nof sampling as a function of right ascension. To minimise such features, the slice\nthickness increases to 7.5\u25e6 between right ascension 13.1h and 13.4h. This image\nreveals a wealth of detail, including linear supercluster features, often nearly\nperpendicular to the line of sight. The interesting question to settle statistically\nis whether such transverse features have been enhanced by infall velocities.\nthis is not true in redshift space. Transverse separations are true measures of distance,\nbut apparent radial separations are distorted by peculiar velocities. This redshift-space\nanisotropy should cause two characteristic effects, operating respectively on small and\nlarge scales. On small scales, random orbital velocities within galaxy groups cause an\napparent radial smearing, known as \u2018fingers of God\u2019. Of greater interest is the large-\nscale effect; if cosmological structure forms via gravitational collapse, there should exist\ncoherent infall velocities, and the effect of these is to cause an apparent flattening of\nstructures along the line of sight. The general existence of redshift-space distortions\nwas recognized in the first redshift surveys2,3,4, but the first comprehensive analysis of\nthe phenomenon was performed by Kaiser17, who showed that they could be used to\nmeasure the quantity\n\u03b2 \u2261 \u21260.6\/b,\nwhere \u2126 is the cosmological mass density parameter and b is the bias parameter that\nrelates the relative density fluctuations of the galaxies and of the total mass:\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u2223\n\u2223\n\u2223\n\u2223\ngalaxies\n= b\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u2223\n\u2223\n\u2223\n\u2223\nmass\n.\n3\nFigure 2 The redshift-space correlation function for the 2dFGRS, \u03be(\u03c3, \u03c0),\nplotted as a function of transverse (\u03c3) and radial (\u03c0) pair separation. The func-\ntion was estimated by counting pairs in boxes of side 0.2h\u22121 Mpc (assuming an\n\u2126 = 1 geometry), and then smoothing with a Gaussian of rms width 0.5h\u22121 Mpc.\nTo illustrate deviations from circular symmetry, the data from the first quadrant\nare repeated with reflection in both axes. This plot clearly displays redshift\ndistortions, with \u2018fingers of God\u2019 elongations at small scales and the coherent\nKaiser flattening at large radii. The overplotted contours show model predic-\ntions with flattening parameter \u03b2 \u2261 \u21260.6\/b = 0.4 and a pairwise dispersion of\n\u03c3p = 400 km s\n\u22121. Contours are plotted at \u03be = 10, 5, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1.\nThe model predictions assume that the redshift-space power spectrum\n(Ps) may be expressed as a product of the linear Kaiser distortion and a radial\nconvolution14: Ps(k) = Pr(k) (1 + \u03b2\u00b5\n2)2 (1 + k2\u03c32p\u00b5\n2\/2H20 )\n\u22121, where \u00b5 = k\u02c6 \u00b7 r\u02c6,\nand \u03c3p is the rms pairwise dispersion of the random component of the galaxy ve-\nlocity field. This model gives a very accurate fit to exact nonlinear simulations15.\nFor the real-space power spectrum, Pr(k), we take the estimate obtained by de-\nprojecting the angular clustering in the APM survey13,16. This agrees very well\nwith estimates that can be made directly from the 2dFGRS, as will be discussed\nelsewhere. We use this model only to estimate the scale dependence of the\nquadrupole-to-monopole ratio (although Fig. 2 shows that it does match the full\n\u03be(\u03c3, \u03c0) data very well).\nThe presence of bias is an inevitable consequence of the nonlinear nature of galaxy for-\nmation, and the relation between mass and galaxy tracers is complex18,19,20. However,\nthere are good theoretical reasons to expect that b can indeed be treated as a constant\non large scales, where the density fluctuations are linear21,22. Redshift-space distortions\n4\nhave thus been seen as an important method for weighing the universe23,24. To date, a\nnumber of papers have made significant detections of the Kaiser effect18,25,26, but the\n2dFGRS is the first survey that is large enough for the effect to be studied in detail.\nIn order to estimate \u03be(\u03c3, \u03c0), we follow standard methods27,28 that compare the\nobserved count of galaxy pairs with the count estimated using a random distribution\nthat obeys the same selection effects in redshift and sky position. These selection effects\nare well defined, but complex: the survey is tessellated into a pattern of \u2018sectors\u2019 defined\nby the overlap of the 2\u25e6 diameter survey tiles, whose positions are chosen adaptively with\nthe aim of being able to place a fibre on > 95% of the galaxies in the input catalogue.\nAt the present intermediate stage of the survey, many tiles remain to be observed, and\nsome regions of the survey presently contain redshifts for < 50% of the galaxies. Fur-\nthermore, the spectroscopic success rate (redshifts per allocated fibre) is > 95% in good\nconditions, but can fall to \u2243 80% in marginal weather. We have implemented a number\nof independent algorithms for estimating the resulting survey selection effects, and are\nconfident that we can measure the galaxy correlations robustly out to a separation of\n25h\u22121 Mpc. For example, the redshift distribution in sectors with low spectroscopic\ncompleteness is biased to low redshifts, but it makes no significant difference whether\nor not we correct for this, or indeed whether the low-completeness regions are simply\nexcised. In addition to allowing for survey completeness, it is necessary to give higher\nweight to regions with a low sampling density, to achieve the optimum balance between\ncosmic variance and shot noise6. In practice, we have chosen to truncate the analysis\nat a maximum redshift of z = 0.25. Within this volume, the exact optimum weight per\ngalaxy varies very nearly as the reciprocal of the number density, so that all volume\nelements receive approximately equal weight. The redshift-space correlation function\nfor the 2dFGRS computed in this way is shown in Fig. 2. The correlation-function\nresults display very clearly the two signatures of redshift-space distortions discussed\nabove. The \u2018fingers of God\u2019 from small-scale random velocities are very clear, as indeed\nhas been the case from the first redshift surveys3. However, this is the first time that\nthe detailed signature of large-scale flattening from coherent infall has been seen with\nhigh signal-to-noise.\nQuantifying redshift-space distortions\nThe large-scale flattening of the correlation function may be quantified by measuring\nthe quadrupole moment of \u03be(\u03c3, \u03c0) as a function of radius. A negative quadrupole mo-\nment implies flattening, whereas the finger-of-God distortion tends to yield a positive\nquadrupole moment. Fig. 3 shows that the quadrupole-to-monopole ratio is positive\non small scales, but that it falls with separation, becoming progressively more negative\nup to the largest separations at which it can be reliably measured. This arises partly\nbecause the underlying power spectrum is not a simple power law function of scale, so\nthat the peculiar velocities have a different effect at different radii. By integrating over\nthe correlation function, it is possible to construct quantities in which this effect is elim-\ninated. We shall not do this here, firstly because it seems desirable to keep the initial\nanalysis as direct as possible. More importantly, finger-of-God smearing is a significant\ncorrection that will also cause the flattening to depend on radius. We therefore have\nto fit the data with a two-parameter model, described in the caption to Fig. 2. The\nparameters are \u03b2 and a measure of the size of the random dispersion in the relative\nvelocities of galaxies, \u03c3p. In practice, \u03c3p plays the role of an empirical fitting parameter\n5\nto describe the scale on which the distortions approach the linear-theory predictions. It\ntherefore also incorporates other possible effects, such as a scale dependence of bias.\nFigure 3 The flattening of the redshift-space correlation function is quanti-\nfied by the quadrupole-to-monopole ratio, \u03be2\/\u03be0. This quantity is positive where\nfingers-of-God distortion dominates, and is negative where coherent infall dom-\ninates. The solid lines show model predictions for \u03b2 = 0.3 0.4 and 0.5, with a\npairwise velocity dispersion of \u03c3p = 400 km s\n\u22121 (solid lines), plus \u03b2 = 0.4 with\n\u03c3p = 300 and 500 km s\n\u22121 (dashed lines). The \u03be2\/\u03be0 ratio becomes more negative\nas \u03b2 increases and as \u03c3p decreases. At large radii, the effects of fingers-of-God\nbecome relatively small, and values of \u03b2 \u2243 0.4 are clearly appropriate.\nThe multipole moments of the correlation function are defined as \u03be\u2113(r) \u2261\n(2\u2113 + 1)\/2\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\n\u03be(\u03c3 = r sin \u03b8, \u03c0 = r cos \u03b8) P\u2113(cos \u03b8) d cos \u03b8. In linear theory, the\nquadrupole-to-monopole ratio is given29 by \u03be2\/\u03be0 = f(n) (4\u03b2\/3 + 4\u03b2\n2\/7) \/ (1 +\n2\u03b2\/3 + \u03b22\/5). Here f(n) = (3 + n)\/n, where n is the power-spectrum index of\nthe density fluctuations: \u03be \u221d r\u2212(3+n). In practice, nonlinear effects mean that\nthis ratio is a function of scale. We model this by using the real-space correla-\ntion function estimated from the APM survey13,16, plus the model for nonlinear\nfinger-of-God smearing given in the caption to Fig. 2.\nThe results for the quadrupole-to-monopole ratio are shown in Fig. 3, which\nshows the average of the estimates for the NGP and SGP slices. The difference between\nthe NGP and SGP allows an estimate of the errors to be made: these slices are inde-\npendent samples for the present analysis of clustering on relatively small scales. For\nmodel fitting, it is necessary to know the correlation between the values at different r. A\nsimple way of addressing this is to determine the effective number of degrees of freedom\nfrom the value of \u03c72 for the best-fitting model. A more sophisticated approach is to\n6\nFigure 4 Likelihood contours for \u03b2 and the fingers-of-God smearing param-\neter \u03c3p, based on the data in Fig. 3 (considering 8h\n\u22121 Mpc < r < 25h\u22121 Mpc).\nThese are plotted at the usual positions for one-parameter confidence of 68%\n(shaded region), and two-parameter confidence of 68%, 95% and 99% (i.e. \u2206\u03c72 =\n1, 2.3, 6.0, 9.2). The maximum-likelihood solution is \u03b2 = 0.43 and \u03c3p = 385 km s\n\u22121.\nThe value for the large-scale pairwise dispersion is in reasonable agreement with\npreviously suggested values30; however, for the present analysis \u03c3p is an unin-\nteresting parameter. If we marginalize over \u03c3p (i.e. integrate over \u03c3p, treating\nthe likelihood as a probability distribution), the final estimate of \u03b2 and its rms\nuncertainty is \u03b2 = 0.43\u00b1 0.07.\nWe believe that this result is robust, in the sense that systematic errors\nin the modelling are smaller than the random errors. We have tried assuming\nthat the power spectrum for k < 0.1hMpc\u22121 has the shape of a \u2126 = 0.3 \u039bCDM\nmodel, rather than the APM measurement; this has a very small effect. A more\nserious issue is whether the pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies may depend\nstrongly on separation, as is found for mass particles in numerical simulations31.\nAssuming that the pairwise velocity dispersion \u03c3p rises to twice its large-scale\nvalue below 1h\u22121 Mpc reduces the best-fit \u03b2 by 0.04. This correction is small\nbecause our analysis excludes the nonlinear data at r < 8h\u22121 Mpc.\ngenerate realizations of \u03be(\u03c3, \u03c0), and construct the required covariance matrix directly.\nOne way of achieving this is to analyze large numbers of mock surveys drawn from\nnumerical simulations32. A more convenient method is to generate direct realizations\nof the redshift-space power spectrum, using Gaussian fluctuations on large scales, but\nallowing for enhanced variance in power on non-linear scales33,34,35. In practice, the\nlikelihood contours resulting from this approach agree well with those from the simple\napproach, and we are confident that the resulting errors on \u03b2 are realistic. These con-\ntours are shown in Fig. 4, and show that there is a degree of correlation between the\n7\npreferred values of \u03b2 and \u03c3p, as expected. For present purposes, \u03c3p is an uninteresting\nparameter, so we marginalize over it to obtain the following estimate of \u03b2 and its rms\nuncertainty:\n\u03b2 = 0.43\u00b1 0.07.\nThis result is the first precise determination of \u03b2 from redshift-space distortions.\nThe best previous studies18,25,26 have achieved no more than a detection of the effect\nat the 3\u03c3 level. Before discussing the implications of our result, we should therefore\nconsider some possible small systematic corrections that have been unimportant in\nearlier work. First, the Kaiser analysis applies only in the small-angle approximation,\nand in principle corrections might be needed for wide-angle surveys such as ours36.\nHowever, with our weighting scheme, the mean angular separation of pairs with spatial\nseparations < 30h\u22121 Mpc is only 2.5\u25e6, so this is not a concern. There is potentially\na significant correction for luminosity effects. The optimal weighting means that our\nmean luminosity is high: it is approximatelyMbJ = \u221220.3, or 1.9 times the characteristic\nluminosity, L\u2217, of the overall galaxy population37. A number of studies38 have suggested\nthat the strength of galaxy clustering increases with luminosity, with an effective bias\nthat can be fitted by b\/b\u2217 = 0.7 + 0.3(L\/L\u2217). This effect has been controversial39,\nbut the 2dFGRS dataset favours a similar luminosity dependence, as will be described\nelsewhere. We therefore expect that \u03b2 for L\u2217 galaxies will exceed our directly measured\nfigure. Applying a correction using the given formula for b(L), we deduce\n\u03b2(L = L\u2217) = 0.54\u00b1 0.09.\nFinally, the 2dFGRS has a median redshift of 0.11. With weighting, the mean redshift\nin the present analysis is z\u00af = 0.17, and our measurement should be interpreted as \u03b2\nat this epoch. The extrapolation to z = 0 is model-dependent, but probably does not\nintroduce a significant change40.\nConsistency with microwave-background anisotropies\nOur results are significant in a number of ways. First, we have verified in some detail\nthat the pattern of redshift-space distortions associated with the gravitationally-driven\ngrowth of clustering exists as predicted. Although gravitational instability is well estab-\nlished as the standard model for the formation of large-scale structure, it is an important\nlandmark to have verified such a characteristic feature of the theory. Extracting the full\ncosmological implications of our measurement of \u21260.6\/b requires us to know the bias pa-\nrameter in order to determine \u2126. For example, our measurement implies \u2126 = 0.36\u00b10.10\nif L\u2217 galaxies are unbiased, but it is difficult to justify such an assumption. In principle,\nthe details of the clustering pattern in the nonlinear regime allow the \u2126\u2212 b degeneracy\nto be broken, yielding a direct determination of the degree of bias43. We expect to\npursue this approach using the 2dFGRS. For the present, however, it is interesting to\nuse an independent approach. Observations of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) can in principle measure almost all the cosmological parameters,\nand current small-scale anisotropy results are starting to tighten the constraints. In a\nrecent analysis41, best-fitting values for the densities in collisionless matter (c), baryons\n(b), and vacuum (v) have been obtained: \u2126c+\u2126b+\u2126v = 1.11\u00b10.07, \u2126ch\n2 = 0.14\u00b10.06,\n\u2126bh\n2 = 0.032\u00b10.005, together with a power-spectrum index n = 1.01\u00b10.09. Our result\nfor \u03b2 gives an independent test of this picture, as follows.\n8\nFigure 5 The dimensionless matter power spectrum at zero redshift, \u22062(k),\nas predicted from the allowed range of models that fit the microwave-background\nanisotropy data, plus the assumption that H0 = 70 km s\n\u22121Mpc\u22121 \u00b1 10%. The\nsolid line shows the best-fit model41 (power-spectrum index n = 1.01, and density\nparameters in baryons, CDM, and vacuum of respectively 0.065, 0.285, 0.760).\nThe effects of nonlinear evolution have been included42. The shaded band shows\nthe 1\u03c3 variation around this model allowed by the CMB data. The solid points\nare the real-space power spectrum measured for APM galaxies. The clear conclu-\nsion is that APM galaxies are consistent with being essentially unbiased tracers\nof the mass on large scales. Since the CMB data also constrain the range of \u2126,\nthis allows \u03b2 to be predicted.\nThe only parameter left undetermined by the CMB data is the Hubble constant,\nh. Recent work44,45 indicates that this is now determined to an rms accuracy of 10%,\nand we adopt a central value of h = 0.70. This completes the cosmological model,\nrequiring a total matter density parameter \u2126 \u2261 \u2126c + \u2126b = 0.35 \u00b1 0.14. It is then\npossible to use the parameter limits from the CMB to predict a conservative range for\nthe mass power spectrum at z = 0, which is shown in Fig. 5. A remarkable feature of\nthis plot is that the mass power spectrum appears to be in good agreement with the\nclustering observed in the APM survey. For each model allowed by the CMB, we can\npredict both b (from the ratio of galaxy and mass spectra) and also \u03b2 (since a given CMB\nmodel specifies \u2126). In practice, we determine b by determining the mean ratio of power\nspectra over the range 0.02 < k < 0.1hMpc\u22121, where the APM measurement is robust\nand where scale-dependent bias and nonlinearities should be unimportant. Considering\nthe allowed range of models, we then obtain the prediction \u03b2CMB+APM = 0.57\u00b1 0.17. A\nflux-limited survey such as the APM will have a mean luminosity close to L\u2217, so the\nappropriate comparison is with the 2dFGRS corrected figure of \u03b2 = 0.54\u00b1 0.09 for L\u2217\n9\ngalaxies. These numbers are in very close agreement.\nThis analysis of galaxy clustering in the 2dFGRS thus gives strong support to the\nsimplest picture of cosmological structure formation, in which the primary mechanism\nis gravitational instability in a sea of collisionless dark matter. We have shown that the\nfluctuations seen in the CMB (which measure structure at a redshift z \u2243 1100) can be\nextrapolated to the present to predict the peculiar velocities that distort redshift-space\nclustering. The agreement between this extrapolation and direct observations from the\n2dFGRS is a remarkable and highly non-trivial test of the basic model. The precision of\ndata in both areas should improve rapidly, and the use of \u03b2 as a meeting ground between\nstudies of the CMB and large-scale structure will undoubtedly lead to more demanding\ntests of the theory in years to come. For the present, we can say that there is complete\nconsistency between clustering in the 2dFGRS and the emerging \u2018standard model\u2019 of\ncosmology: a spatially flat, vacuum-dominated universe with density parameter \u2126 \u2243 0.3.\n1Hubble E.P., The Distribution of Extra-Galactic Nebulae, Astrophys.
