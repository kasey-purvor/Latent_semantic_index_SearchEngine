A systems view is essential to \nrelate each part to the whole. This model of the geoscience information system should \ntake into account: the need to separate data and process to enable reuse; the modes of \nthought of the geoscientist and how memory orders our thoughts; the shared \ngeoscience record (knowledge base) and its interface with users; how ideas are linked \nas a network; how knowledge is organized; how a general overview can be \nmaintained and linked to detail; how projects relate business objectives to the \nknowledge base and incentives keep the system alive. \n \nKey Words - Systems view, thought modes, ideas network, business aspects. \n \n \n1. A scheme of ideas \n \n\u201cIt is a profoundly erroneous truism,\u201d wrote Whitehead (1911), \u201cthat we should \ncultivate the habit of thinking about what we are doing. The precise opposite is the \ncase. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which \nwe can perform without thinking about them.\u201d But elsewhere (as quoted by Laszlo, \n1972) he wrote: \u201cin creative thought, common sense is a bad master. Its sole criterion \nfor judgment is that the new ideas should look like the old ones.\u201d and \u201c. . the true \nmethod of philosophical construction is to frame a scheme of ideas, the best that one \ncan, and unflinchingly to explore the interpretation of experience in terms of that \nscheme . . . all constructive thought, on the various topics of scientific interest, is \ndominated by some such scheme, unacknowledged, but no less influential in guiding \nthe imagination. The importance of philosophy lies in its sustained effort to make \nsuch schemes explicit, and thereby capable of criticism and improvement\u201d \n(Whitehead, 1929).  \n \nKuhn (see part K section 1.2) resolves these apparent contradictions by distinguishing \nbetween \u201cnormal\u201d science and revolutions in science. Normal science thrives on \nroutine incremental additions to the body of knowledge, where the paradigm can be \ntaken for granted. But revolutionary change calls for validation of ideas against basic \nprinciples. Our present concern is with changes to the supporting information \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part I (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \ntechnology that pervades all of geoscience. To grasp their significance, we need a \nbroad view. \n \n1.2 The need for a top-down view \n \nSpecialization helped the advance of science by overcoming the limited capacity of \nindividuals to store and process information. By working in groups, each gains \nknowledge in depth of a specialized topic, complementing the knowledge of others. \nDifficulties arise, however, in communicating between specialist fields. Trapped in \nbubbles of specialization, we spin in our own eddies and lose track of the mainstream.  \n \nIn day to day work a bottom-up approach is inevitable, concentrating on the detail \nand then fitting the pieces together. But rather than trying to assemble the jigsaw \npuzzle by building outwards from the pieces in your hand, it may be better to study \nthe picture on the box lid. The system description should follow a top-down \napproach, seeking always the broad picture without which the detail might be \nmisplaced. We therefore look at the behavior of the system as a whole and the \nstructure and relationships of its specialized components. The objectives are to \nunderstand and control the massive changes stemming from the current advances in \nIT.  \n \n1.3 A glimpse of a broad panorama \n \nWe have looked in earlier sections at many aspects of IT. It offers many benefits. \nInformation technology can help to deliver information efficiently in an appropriate \nform, where and when required. It can help to represent geoscience knowledge more \ncomprehensively, linking ideas in a more fully connected network. It can help to \nmanipulate the information more effectively with techniques to model, search, \nvisualize, generalize and reconcile ideas. \n \nWe look next at the process of acquiring and recording knowledge. Geoscientists \nmaintain in their minds a general model of the workings of geoscience and quite \nspecific information about their own area of specialization. Each scientist has a \nunique view of the world, but in total, their knowledge overlaps to a large extent. The \nthought processes of the individual are modified by interactions within workgroups, \nand developed by training and study. They give rise to an explicit ordering of ideas as \nrecorded knowledge. \n \nWe shall look further at the role of IT tools in supporting the thought processes of \ngeoscientists. We usually take our thought processes for granted. However, by \nconsidering them explicitly, we may make better use of the tools and improve the \ninformation system. To understand the processes, we can draw on the work of brain \nspecialists, on philosophers who study thought processes, and introspection of our \nown procedures. Change to one part can have unexpected consequences elsewhere (B \n4), so we must study the system and its interrelated parts as a whole. \n \nThis leads to a view of future systems. IT networks connect many information \nsources, containing narrative text, spatial data and interpretations, structured \ndatabases, computer models, references to material and links to experts. This is the \nemerging global hypermedia knowledge repository, also known as cyberspace. It \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part I (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nneeds structures that guide contributors and users on where to put things and where to \nfind them. Local structures are built and maintained by geoscience information \ncommunities and supported by shared metadata. Smaller projects can relate to these \nand remain in tune with global developments. The system must handle incentives \n(cash or kudos), because driving forces keep the system alive. \n \n2. Systems \n \nA system can be defined as a collection or set of interrelated and interacting objects \nor entities, including their relationships and behavior, which can usefully be studied as \na whole. Early writers in this field, such as Beer (1967) and Laszlo (1972) stress the \nwide applicability of the systems approach. They note the importance of the gestalt \nprinciple - that the organized whole is more than the sum of its parts. More recent \nwriters (such as Addis, 1985, Van Lehn 1991) have applied systems insights in \nspecific fields, notably computer system design, and data and systems analysis. The \nobject-oriented approach to design and analysis (H 5, J 2.4) owes much to this \nbackground.  \n \nThe information system is where geoscience and IT meet. It deals with recorded \nknowledge, and its associated tools, activities and procedures. It is concerned, \ntherefore, with how and why we collect information, process and record it, structure \nit, analyze it, draw conclusions, and make the results available to others. It is \nconcerned with the information industry - not just with the work of computing \nspecialists, such as analysts, programmers, designers, database managers, systems and \nnetwork managers, but also with the more traditional work of scientists, surveyors, \nauthors, editors, referees, publishers, librarians, archivists, booksellers, reviewers and \nreaders. It is concerned not just with the tools of modern IT but equally with products \nof the older technologies. \n \n2.1 Designing change \n \nWe might think of the conventional information system as being like a set of books, \nmaps and reports arranged on a shelf and cataloged in a card index. With full IT \nsupport, we need a new model. It may resemble more an interwoven fabric of objects \nand processes in cyberspace. Such major changes mean that we must look at the \narchitecture of the geoscience information system. Architecture, in this context, is \ndefined as the structure of components, their interrelationships, and the principles and \nguidelines governing their design and evolution over time. We will look at the \nmetadata of dictionaries and models that define terms and relationships; the \nhierarchies of object classes; the systems by which the information is managed and \nmanipulated; and the frameworks in which information is organized to tell a coherent \nstory. \n \nAn information system strategy deals with the change from existing to new ways of \nworking. It might apply to an individual, workgroup, project or company. Regardless \nof the scope, it addresses three questions (CCTA, 1989): \n\u2022 Where are we now?  \n\u2022 Where do we want to be?  \n\u2022 How do we get there?  \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part I (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nThe IS strategy would normally apply at corporate level, and lead to an \nimplementation plan that concentrated on actions to introduce new IT developments. \nThese might involve specification of new software and the design of data models \nusing CASE tools (H 3). But our immediate concern is different. We are looking at \nthe science as a whole, as a broad background for more detailed studies. \n \n2.2 Subsystems, interfaces, models and metadata \n \nFor descriptive purposes, the system can be broken down into subsystems.  We can \nthink of each of these as a system of smaller extent, selected to include objects and \nprocesses that naturally belong together. Complexity of behavior should be \nincorporated within the subsystems as far as possible, thus simplifying the interfaces \nbetween them. The interface is the shared boundary between systems or parts of a \nsystem, or the means of interaction between them that makes joint operation possible. \nAn interface device, for example, provides compatibility by enabling one item of \nequipment to communicate with another. An example may clarify the value of such an \napproach.  \n \nIt causes few external problems if we replace an established self-contained procedure \nby a new one. Indeed, this can be a good way to gain initial familiarity with \ncomputing. For example, a geologist might decide to experiment with a computer \ntechnique for drawing graphic logs. Nothing beyond that single task need be affected. \nIf, however, the routine preparation of graphic logs is to be automated, the data must \nbe available to the computer, and a database is a possibility. Standards for recording \ndata exist (L 4) and maybe the data could be incorporated in a shared archive, \navailable also for drawing cross-sections and map making. Rather than storing the \npaper logs, the images might be recreated when required, in forms appropriate to \nspecific users, perhaps geophysicists, geochemists or soil scientists, each with their \nown needs.   \n \nThe self-contained task has become open-ended, hinting at broad new possibilities. \nMeanwhile cartographers in the same organization might be automating their map \ndata on different principles. Solutions to small computer tasks can grow haphazardly \nin this way (and as described in B 4) from many different points, and because they \ntend eventually to overlap and conflict, the outcome is generally unsatisfactory. If a \ngood system model, or description of the system, is available, then standard \ninterfaces between the subsystems can be defined. Provided the standard interfaces \nare maintained, operations in one specialized subsystem can be adjusted without \naffecting others. \n \nIn describing the system, however, we should bear in mind another issue (K 1.2). \nKent (1978, page 93) comments: \u201cA model is a basic system of constructs used in \ndescribing reality. It reflects a person's deepest assumptions regarding the elementary \nessence of things. It may be called a \u2018world view\u2019. It provides the building blocks, the \nvocabulary that pervades all of a person's descriptions. . .  A model is more than a \npassive medium for recording our view of reality. It shapes that view, and limits our \nperceptions. If a mind is committed to a certain model, then it will perform amazing \nfeats of distortion to see things structured that way, and it will simply be blind to the \nthings which don't fit that structure.\u201d It is unwise therefore to adopt a specific world \nview without serious thought, or to take a fixed view of a changing world. \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part I (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \n \nThere are many ways of looking at systems, and many possible models of varying \nextent. Hence there is a need for a higher-level description of information that enables \nit to be understood outside the context in which it was collected. This is the \nmetadata, the data about data mentioned in A 1. Metadata might contain definitions \nof relevant objects and refer to a model (known as a data model) indicating the \nrelationships between them. Individual models are likely to refer to specific \nsubsystems, dealing with topics such as geophysics, stratigraphy, spatial aspects, or \nbusiness aspects. Sections L 5, L 6.1 look at some attempts to relate these to one \nanother and thus define geoscience metadata as a whole. The initial step, however, is \nanalysis of the geoscience information system. \n \n2.3 Scope and components of the system \n \nSystem boundaries are somewhat arbitrary, and so we must define the scope of the \nsystem, that is, its extent, what it consists of and how it works. We need to identify \nthe components of the geoscience information system and their interactions, the \nparticipants and their roles, activities and driving forces. For present purposes, it is \nimportant to identify aspects of the system that are essential for carrying out its task, \nrather than those which reflect the limitations or historical development of \ntechnology.   \n \nFig. 1 depicts the real world at the base and recorded information at the top, with \nscientists as individuals and in groups moving to and fro between them. Recorded \ninformation is shown as a triangle. At the base is the detailed raw data, collected by \nobservation and measurement. An important scientific activity is reworking those data \nby generalization, interpretation, explanation and indexing. These operations \nprogressively reduce the information to more concise forms, thus ensuring that they \ncan be more widely shared. In doing so, they alter the original data, creating new \ninformation. The triangle in Fig. 1 narrows as the volume reduces, as a reminder of \nthese essential processes of abstraction. The process transfers ideas from observation \nto explanation, from data to metadata. \n \n \n \nFig. 1. Scientists collect and record information. From observations and measurements of objects in the \nreal world, information is assembled, assessed and added to the store of recorded knowledge. \n \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part I (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nThe real world as studied by geoscientists presumably exists independently of those \nwho study it. It can therefore be treated as a system external to the information \nsystem. Scientists, who are thought by some to exist independently of their work, are \nagain external systems. They interface with the real world through their \ninvestigations, and with the information system through their work in studying, \nimproving and extending the information base. The business environment, and the \nbackground theory used to explain the data, much of it from other disciplines such \nas physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics and engineering, can also be regarded as \nseparate systems. An attempt to show their relationships diagrammatically (Fig. 2), \nmakes it clear that the geoscientists, not the information system, occupy the central \nposition, and the interactions between the major systems are mediated by the \nscientists. The lasting record of the scientists\u2019 work is seen in information \nrepositories - the vast body of recorded information in books, serials, reports and \nmaps, as well as archived data, cores, samples and specimens. In addition, much \nunrecorded knowledge is held in the minds of individuals. \n \n \n \nFig. 2. Linking information to background theory and objectives. Geoscientists link the repositories of \nrecorded geoscience knowledge and knowledge of other fields, business requirements, and their \ninteractions with the real world. \n \nAnalysis of a system involves identifying components that can be studied separately \nin more detail, without losing sight of their interfaces and relationships. It soon \nbecomes clear that many subdivisions, based on different criteria, are both possible \nand desirable. One possible basis for subdivision starts by separating the data (in the \nrepositories) from the operations or processes that are applied to manage and \nmanipulate them. The process of, say, depicting a number of features on a map, or of \ncontouring a set of elevation values, is similar regardless of the area or dataset to \nwhich it is applied. When the processes are carried out manually, the distinction is \nbetween the data and the set of procedures and techniques. Where computer methods \nare used, the distinction is between the data and the program. An advantage of \nseparating process and data is the prospect of reuse. A geologist who has learned the \ntechniques of contouring can reuse them repeatedly in many different situations. \nComputer software can be prepared and maintained once, but used many times by \nmany users. The same dataset can be analyzed by many different procedures. These \nbenefits depend on clear, consistent interfaces. The means of linking separate data and \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part I (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nprocesses are developed in the object-oriented approach (H 5). Following Kent \n(1978), this leads to a three-part division of the system: repositories, processes and \ntheir interface to the outside world.  \n \nThe user interface (which can have more specific titles like machine interface, \nhuman-computer interface or HCI) is concerned with communication between the \ninformation system and the user (L 2). It includes output from the computer to screen \nor printer, and input to the computer from scanner, keyboard, mouse, or other device. \nWith our broad definition of the information system, we must include traditional \ndevices, such as pen and paper, typewriters and typesetters. \n \nThe user interface must give access to such functions as: \n\u2022 input \n\u2022 data management \n\u2022 data manipulation \n\u2022 modeling \n\u2022 output  \nIt should handle these in a consistent manner. Furthermore, as mentioned in parts C - \nH, it must deal consistently with activities involving varying degrees of collaboration:  \n\u2022 personal computing, individual thought processes and concepts developed and \ninherited from training and study \n\u2022 interactions within a workgroup, preparation of project-centered documents \nand explicit metadata \n\u2022 developing the main corpus of knowledge at the corporate and global level to \nadvance the science as a whole, maintaining the canon, and sharing knowledge \nwith known and unknown colleagues of past, present and future \n \n3. A student looks at the real world \n \nMoving on from general systems aspects, we focus first on the conventional (non-IT) \ngeoscience information system and how it handles recorded knowledge. As we work \nthrough from this to IT-based systems, it may help to have in mind a geoscience \ninvestigation in which you were personally involved. My own choice of an example is \nclose to my home. \n \nNear the center of Edinburgh, Scotland, there is a tiny mountain, not 250m high, with \nthe unusual name of Arthur's Seat. It is the remnant of a Carboniferous volcano. \nGenerations of geology students have been brought here to meet the realities on which \nthe science is based. From a viewpoint on Salisbury Crags, they can look across the \ngrassy slopes of the Queen's Park, and see the smoke-blackened tenement houses of \nthe Royal Mile, like spikes on a long tail stemming from a smaller volcanic crag to \nwhich the Castle clings. Beneath the slopes are sandstones, known from boreholes \nwhich once provided water to the breweries beside the Royal Mile. South of the Royal \nMile is part of the ancient University. Here, intellectual battles between Neptunists \nand Plutonists once raged (Wyllie, 1999). The eventual paradigm shift, deciding in \nfavor of igneous rocks cooling from a molten magma, rather than precipitating from a \nprimeval ocean, presumably resulted in wholesale reconsideration of earlier \nobservations. \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part I (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nFrom the viewpoint, the students can be led along a track at the base of a cliff of \ncrystalline rock, examining the color and texture of freshly broken samples. They can \nobserve the contact between this crystalline material and the underlying bedded \nsandstone, with its water-worn grains set in a silty matrix; can see the hardened, \ndiscolored sediment where it was baked in contact with the igneous rock, and observe \nthe diminution of crystal size where the igneous rock cooled rapidly at the lower \ncontact. Observations during a short walk along the base of the igneous body suggest \nthat it lies parallel to the bedding of the sandstone. Then, vertigo permitting, a few \nobservations at the top of the cliff reveal similar contact relationships in reverse. \nHaving now identified the igneous intrusion as a sill, it can be positioned on a map, \nwith measurements by compass and clinometer of its regional slope and that of the \nsurrounding sediment. \n \nThe strange hollow at the base of the Crags unrelated to any apparent river erosion, \nand the crag and tail formation of the Castle Rock, can be explained to the student as \nglacial features, with an invitation to imagine the huge glaciers of the Ice Age \ngrinding overhead on their way from the distant Highlands to the sea, gouging away \nthe landscape, impeded here and there by harder volcanic rock. An ice-striated rock \nface is conveniently to hand. Now gather round and look at this map showing \norientation and type of glacial features across central Scotland and observe our \nposition in the regional picture. \n \nThe volcano itself is a little more difficult. The outcrops on Arthur's Seat show the \nnow-familiar crystalline rock. The landforms suggest sheet-like lava flows, all with a \nregional dip to the east. Microscopic examination of thin sections back in the \nlaboratory confirms that successive sheets have distinct petrographic characteristics \nwhich can be conveniently recorded on data sheets. Some careful mapping in that \nrough terrain and a coherent story emerges of a sequence of events (deposition, \nintrusion, volcanic activity, tilting, erosion, glaciation) consistent with the evidence \nand with what is known from the surroundings and elsewhere.   \n \nFrom the summit looking eastwards one can see the estuary of the River Forth \nopening out into the North Sea. A separate excursion will take us 60 kms east to the \ncoast at Siccar Point, noting on the way the Old Red Sandstone of Devonian age, \nexposed along the coastal cliffs as thick near-horizontal beds. From the car park, we \nwill stumble across the beach on rough vertical ridges of Lower Paleozoic gray shale \nand sandstone, etched by waves and partly obscured by sand and boulders brought in \nby last winter's storms. We come to a point where the vertical strata are plastered over \nby boulders and sand, as elsewhere but now consolidated. Following the consolidated \nbeds we realize that we are looking at the local base of the Old Red Sandstone. The \nmore imaginative students will perceive, as Hutton did on this very spot in 1788, that, \nhad they been old enough, they could have stumbled across a rather similar beach in \nDevonian times. His visit is vividly recorded by Playfair (1805). As for the now-\nvertical Silurian strata, they too must once have been deposited as horizontal beds. \nAcross Playfair\u2019s giddy abyss of time, the present is seen as the key to the past. \n \nFrom the cliff-tops we can look out across the North Sea, now criss-crossed by \nseismic tracks, the underlying strata penetrated by thousands of wells as it developed \ninto a significant source of oil and gas. Its three-dimensional subsurface geology is \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part I (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nknown in great detail thanks to modern instrumentation, with digital records that can \nbe displayed on the computer screen. \n \nAfter these experiences, the students may be able to draw some tentative conclusions \nabout how geoscientists work and think, some more obvious than others. Points \nrelevant to IT will be discussed as they arise. First, we need to review the process of \ninvestigation just described. \n \n4. How memory orders our thoughts \n \nWe observe much, remember little, and record less. We direct our attention towards \ninformation which clarifies the developing geological picture. The more relevant the \nmaterial, the longer we remember it. We extract ideas from the geological picture to \nmodify or reinforce our background knowledge. For example, observations of heaps \nof loose rock fragments at the base of the cliff might enter short-term memory \n(which enables us to remember small amounts of information very accurately for a \nbrief period). But having avoided tripping over them, we soon forget them, just as we \nremember in detail the flow of words from the professor just long enough to interpret \ntheir significance. Episodic memory holds information much longer (though not \nalways reliably) and allows us, in our mind\u2019s eye, to recreate sequences of past \nexperiences and events. Although the episodes are typically an autobiographical view \nof our own experiences, we may similarly build in memory an internal narrative of \nprocesses, states and events in the geological past (the conceptual model of B 4.1). \nThus the observations which enable us to build a picture of the intrusion of the sill \nmight be passed on from short-term to episodic memory by tying them to events in its \ngeological history. These can be linked in turn to the broader history of the volcano, \nthe region, and more general aspects of the geoscience model. Recognizing that the \nrocks involved in the intrusive episode apparently followed well-established \nprinciples relating, say, crystal size to rate of cooling, confirms the value of ideas such \nas the present being the key to the past. This reinforces concepts in semantic \nmemory, which deals with acquiring and using general knowledge, and with \nbackground understanding of what is true and what is significant. \n \nThis suggests that our brains have a built-in ability to abstract and generalize, building \nsummaries that are remembered when the detailed observations are long forgotten. In \nactivities involving short-term memory, thought may provide an instant response. At \nthe other extreme, activities involving episodic and semantic memory may give rise to \ndeep cogitation and reflection, with repeated review of the options, reaching \nconclusions only after a long period. The first may lead to entries in a field notebook, \nthe second to publication of a considered opinion. \n \nPsychologists and neurophysiologists have identified several levels of memory and \nhave been able by experimental investigations to map them to distinct regions of the \nbrain (Pinker, 1997). As well as those already mentioned, there are other levels \nrelevant to our present purposes. Procedural memory involves learning motor and \ncognitive skills, sometimes executed subconsciously, as in trimming a hand specimen \nwith a hammer or sketching in a notebook. Spatial memory refers to spatial pattern \nand the relative location of objects in space. These concepts have been carried across \nto studies in machine intelligence (in Brachman and Levesque, 1985) and to data \nanalysis (Kent, 1978). \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part I (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \n \nThe different levels of memory are not wholly distinct, however. Recent research (see \nMcCrone, 1997, 1999), which studies the working of the conscious brain with non-\ninvasive techniques, emphasizes the intricate interconnections of the brain. It \nconcludes that events influence, and their perception is influenced by, the state of the \nbrain as a whole. The brain\u2019s responses to input are dynamic, non-linear and thus \nlargely unpredictable, quite unlike those of the digital computer. Specialized regions \nof the brain do perform specific functions. But the brain was not designed component \nby component. It evolved as a whole in response to its environment over past \ngenerations and developed in response to events in its own lifetime. This fits the \ncommon-sense view that we should regard the computer not as an extension to our \nbrains, but as a shared tool for managing and manipulating stored knowledge more \neffectively for the benefit of the human users. \n \nIt is clear that we must record information and knowledge if we wish to share them \nwidely. We must store records to make them available in the future to others and to \nrefresh our own uncertain memories. In these records, we can detect narrative text \nrecording stories from episodic memory, data files and field notes that communicate \nwith short-term memory, maps and diagrams that match our spatial memory, \ntextbooks that feed our semantic memory. The immediate reasons for considering \nconventional systems (that is, those not designed with modern IT in mind) are to see \nwhere improvements are desirable, what knock-on effects they might cause, and how \nour legacy of recorded information can be carried forward into a new environment. \nThe description, therefore, follows the system subdivisions mentioned in I 2.3 of \ninterface, repository and process, to which business aspects are added. \n \n5. Interfaces in a conventional system \n \n5.1 Access \n \nIn conventional systems, users can interface directly with the knowledge base. This \nincludes the formal and informal literature, in-house records and archives, computer \nfiles and the vast pool of knowledge held in scientists' minds. Access to recorded \ninformation may involve intermediaries, such as librarians, curators, record clerks or \nbooksellers. These powerful figures are equivalent to the middleware (L 2) of a \nsoftware system and influence what is visible to the user.  \n \nConventional publications in geoscience assume that readers are familiar with current \nthinking. Using them effectively depends on the user knowing, or finding out, which \nbooks and serials deal with relevant topics at an appropriate level of generality and \ncomplexity. Unpublished knowledge may be passed on formally through managers \nand supervisors, and informally through a network of colleagues, by discussion, \npresentation and demonstration.  \n \nThe interface is also involved when users contribute to the knowledge base. \nInformally, information can be passed on without delay. A typical published scientific \npaper, however, is prepared and edited with great care over a period of some months \nor years, and a similar time may elapse between submission of the completed paper \nand its final publication. Many copies of the paper are distributed and printed, \nalthough only a fraction of one per cent of the published copies may be read in any \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part I (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \ndetail. Each contribution to the published record is identifiable, permanent and \nunchanging. \n \n5.2 Connectivity \n \nKnowledge has its source in the highly connected networks of the human mind, with \nmany links that cannot be carried through to written records. Selections of the same \nmaterial are therefore repeated in different forms for different readers, such as \ngeophysicists, geologists, or engineers. Some connections, however, can be recorded. \nThey include references to related papers for background, corroboration or detail; to \nspecific points within a paper by page number or quotation; or to points on a map by \ngeographical reference. Amendments and comments may be published later, perhaps \nunknown to readers. \n \nMuch information is repeated from earlier sources, probably reorganized and with \nadded comments relating it to the specific project in hand. Each paper is like a \npatchwork of pieces drawn from many sources, cut to shape, augmented, and sewn \ntogether to produce something new and largely self-contained.  \n \nThe reworking means that the author can repeat the story with changes, introducing a \npersonal opinion. This gives room for local dissent within the world view, and thus \nfor evolution of ideas. In the process, the provenance of ideas may be blurred, and the \nprecise changes and their implications may be apparent to the reader only on making a \ndetailed comparison with the earlier work. The information is organized and arranged \nto follow long-established conventions enforced by editors and publishers, but, within \nthe house-style of the journal, each paper has a different background and distinct \nviewpoint. The apparent simplicity thus conceals the vast labor, perhaps the greater \npart of the project, spent on searching and evaluating earlier work and either \nreconciling it with new ideas and observations (K 1.4) or ignoring or contradicting it. \n \n6. Conventional repositories \n \nWhen an author records information for use by the geoscience community, there is a \nneed:  \n\u2022 to ensure that it meet standards which enable users to understand it \n\u2022 to ensure that it is connected with other information on which it depends \n\u2022 to store it safely in suitable repositories \n\u2022 to identify it for reference purposes \n\u2022 to catalog it for subsequent identification and retrieval \nInternational standards define the codes and procedures for identifying each \ncontribution, and cataloging rules which provide metadata for retrieval by author or \ntopic (H 2). The system must be able to attract and accept contributions, evaluate \nthem, ensure that intellectual property rights are upheld, and reward all concerned (I \n8.2). \n \nUnpublished work may be restricted to a local file. Data records are generally held by \nthe originators, or the commissioning group, or in archives established by geological \nsocieties or other organizations. International sharing of data on, say, global \nseismology, geomagnetism or aspects of oceanography, relies on networks, with \ncollaborating groups exchanging computer files to agreed standards (L 5). Cores, \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part I (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nsamples and specimens are stored in museums or in company or specialist archives, \nsuch as state-funded core stores. \n \n6.1 Repetition \n \nA striking feature of the geoscience knowledge base is the extraordinary amount of \nredundancy, that is, repetition of the same information. Scientists all undergo lengthy \ntraining to develop a shared understanding. The courses necessarily cover much of the \nsame ground, and many of the differences may be due to the fact that they are taught, \nnot by the finest teacher of that topic, but by the one who happens to be in post at that \nparticular place. Understanding is instilled through numerous examples and \nexpositions, and it may be left to students to arrive at their own general conclusions or \nworld views. Whether this is an important part of their training or merely reflects the \nbottom-up view of the instructors no doubt depends on the circumstances. The wide \navailability of textbooks does much to ensure that the best ideas are available for \nsharing. In due course, computer-aided instruction and distance learning (Butler, \n1966) will no doubt also improve standards by making the best teaching methods \nmore widely available.  \n \nPublished information is stored in hundreds, if not thousands, of identical copies \ndistributed through many general, specialist and personal libraries, and may be \nindependently cataloged in many of them. Repetition is also a feature of the detail, \nsuch as descriptions of vertical sections or well samples, where ditto marks are \nubiquitous. Much basic information is laboriously copied from informal reports to \ninclude in published papers which repeat part of what has already appeared in other \npublications. The material used for teaching is likely to have been reworked many \ntimes, perhaps from an original research report to part of a regional assessment to an \naccount of a new method to a paragraph in a textbook. Text accounts overlap with \ninformation shown on a map and vice versa. The reader who consults several sources \nis likely to encounter the same information in many subtly different forms.  \n \nRedundancy is inevitable, and much of it is probably desirable. Scientists, for \nexample, could not communicate without shared understanding based on similar \ntraining. Measurements may be repeated to check their validity. Information is \nclarified and reinforced by repetition, which is why you may reread the same passage \nseveral times. The reader will be influenced by frequently encountering similar ideas, \nand repetition may therefore be a means of indicating what is important. Undesirable \nfeatures of redundancy are that it increases costs and makes change difficult to \ncontrol. A significant part of copying information is unnecessary and unhelpful and \nmight well be reduced by appropriate information technology. Hypertext can link an \nitem to any relevant context. Explicit evaluation could avoid the need to repeat for \nemphasis. A long-term goal may be to create an IT knowledge base in which the same \nrecorded information can be filtered and presented in different ways for many \npurposes from, say, teaching to risk assessment. \n \n6.2 Organization of content \n \nThe literature deals with entities of interest, which might be referred to as objects (J \n2.4), although they are seldom identified as such and their definitions may differ \nsubtly between authors. The object classes, such as stratigraphic units, localities, \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part I (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nfossil or rock types, may be linked implicitly or explicitly to published definitions, or \nmay be defined within the documents which use them. Lexicons and dictionaries \nprovide metadata to standardize the vocabulary. Textbooks and monographs record \nstandard procedures, methods and classifications. The relationships among objects are \nunlikely to be formalized in a data model, but instead are developed in a text \nnarrative. \n \nA geological document is concerned with more than one narrative thread of events. It \nweaves together a set of stories concerning various aspects of the geology (J 1.1). An \naccount of the reasons for undertaking the investigation and of the methods and \ninstrumentation might be woven in with separate threads giving conclusions about the \ngeological history of the area, aspects of the stratigraphy, petrography, structural and \neconomic geology, and so on, all related to one another in a single coherent \ndocument.  \n \nText narrative is generally concerned with describing observations, sequences of \nactions during investigation, and the processes of explanation, such as a chain of \ncause and effect. Diagrams and photographs provide some local spatial context, but \nthe main spatial framework may be handled as a map, possibly separated from the \ntext. Spatial information locates observations and interpretations and describes form \nand shape, spatial patterns and relationships, and movements in space and time. In \ngeoscience, the narrative accounts are also likely to refer to spatial objects in a spatial \nenvironment. Narrative and spatial information, although analyzed in distinct areas of \nthe brain, must therefore be closely linked. In their presentation, however, aspects \nmay be separated because information types can be difficult to combine in one \npublication. Maps are most useful in large format, so that the user can see the overall \npattern, can trace variation or search for detail, while aware of the context through \nperipheral vision. They are therefore published separately, and may be produced \nindependently of text documents for the same area. Tacit knowledge is passed on \ninteractively through training, discussion and demonstration. It may be reinforced by \ninformal papers, but by definition cannot be part of the conventional literature. \n \n7. Processes in the conventional system \n \n7.1 Generalization \n \nAs specialists, we may wish to study parts of a paper in detail. For the rest we require \nonly an abstract or summary of salient points. It is therefore helpful to have an \nexplanatory title, a table of contents, abstract and index that provide a quick overview \nand an easy route to topics of interest. Also, it is only a small number of papers that \ninterest any one reader, and they are easily missed. A significant part of the literature \nis concerned with reviewing and summarizing earlier work from a variety of \nviewpoints. This increases the amount of redundant information, but by reading the \nreview articles we are less likely to miss significant new ideas, regardless of where \nthey were first published. Similarly, maps are available at various scales, so that we \ncan maintain a general overview, as well as finding detail for areas of particular \ninterest.  \n \nA geological survey, for example, may provide illustrated written accounts at several \nlevels of detail, from a regional guide covering a large area to an archived description \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part I (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nof a microfossil. It may also provide maps at different scales with different levels of \ndiscrimination and resolution, from a postcard map of the entire country to a field \nsketch of a single outcrop. Although geological processes differ at different scales, \ndetail and summary are inevitably interrelated. Abstraction and generalization apply \nto all these aspects and to all information types. By reducing the volume of \ninformation, they make it more widely available beyond its own specialized area. \n \nThe scientific literature sifts ideas from earlier papers by reference and quotation. As \nreaders tend to concentrate on recent work, the effect is constantly to revive the more \nimportant ideas. They are implicitly placed, amended if need be, within the current \nparadigm. Other, probably less significant, ideas are allowed to sink into the sludge of \nold, unread papers. Some useful concepts, not recognized as relevant in their time, \ncould also disappear without trace. However, the metadata (or metainformation) \ncreated by librarians, curators and catalogers may save them from oblivion. The \nmetadata have a number of functions:  \n\u2022 to provide a structure or framework of topics to organize the contents of the \ninformation system \n\u2022 thereby, to make it easier to find specific information \n\u2022 to define terminology and describe methods and procedures, thus clarifying \ncommunication.  \n \nThe classifications, definitions and the rules for applying them are generally agreed \nby committees of experts, defined by international standards, and applied by librarians \nor imposed by editors. The results are in dictionaries, lexicons, library catalogs, and \nthe placement of books on library shelves (H 2). Specialist journals reflect, and may \nhelp to define, topic-based subsystems of the information system.  \n \n8. Business aspects \n \n8.1 Projects \n \nContributions to the knowledge base generally stem from projects, and can be fully \nunderstood only in the light of their procedures.  A project is a manageable activity \nwhich has objectives, resources, and structure.  It may involve one individual, \ncarrying out, say, a site investigation or an academic research study, or it may have a \nmultimillion dollar budget and involve collaboration among many institutes.  Each \ngeoscience project has its own objectives, determined by its business setting, and \ntherefore is unique in its methods and information content. Perhaps because of \nrepetition, the conventional documents needed to provide background geoscience \ninformation for undertaking a project can be surprisingly few - a small number of \nmaps and reports, perhaps access to a small part of an archive, and the use of a \nhandful of well-known textbooks. The results of a project may be recorded in their \nturn as scientific papers. A paper generally refers to a single project, although several \npapers may deal with different aspects of the same project. Some details of how the \ninvestigation was designed, reflecting the project and its business setting, are \ngenerally necessary to interpret the results correctly, and are therefore described in the \npaper. \n \nIn designing an investigation, there is a trade-off between meeting specific project \nneeds efficiently, and generating information that can be widely shared. Conventional \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part I (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nprocedures do not impose a solution, but do respond to market forces. For instance, a \nspeculative seismic survey may be extended to cover a wider area, in the hope of \nselling the results to more oil companies. The scope of an academic study may be \ndeliberately extended to reach a wider audience, or to make publication easier.  \n \nThere is significant overlap in the basic information required in many projects. As a \nwide variety of investigations rely on the same basic information, it can be more \nefficient to collect it once in a single wide-ranging survey, than repeatedly whenever \nit is required. Organizations such as geological surveys and shared repositories are \nsupported for this purpose, often with state funding. Information from a geological \nsurvey, a museum archive or in-house company records, is more highly structured, \nbut less flexible, than the general scientific literature. It attempts to provide one \ncoherent and consistent picture through the close collaboration of many workers. \nIndividual topics, such as limestone resources or the findings of an aeromagnetic \nsurvey, may be the subject of separate reports, maps or series, or may be included as \nsections within accounts of specific areas, or both. All should tie together as aspects \nof a shared view - a cohesive but limited part of the literature. They constitute the \nresults of a single, large project, and are the base data on which much else is erected \n(M 2.3).  \n \n8.2 Driving forces \n \nThe importance of business aspects permeates the information system (M 1, M 3). \nThe development of specialized journals may be not unrelated to the identification by \ncommercial publishers of two driving forces: the anxiety of authors to publish papers, \neven to the extent of paying for the privilege; and the need for librarians to purchase \nthe result, with little sensitivity to the price. In contrast, some worthy computer \nprojects have neglected the potential driving forces, and failed through not \nanticipating the passive hostility of those who were expected to contribute but not to \nbenefit (Peuquet and Bacastow, 1991). \n \nAuthors are among the more highly motivated participants in the information system. \nTheir career prospects are strongly correlated with the ability to produce a stream of \nvaluable papers. The value of unpublished reports may be judged by a manager, with \nor without help. The manager, who is likely to have asked for the report for a specific \npurpose, is in a good position to judge the result. Publications are judged by their \nvolume and by the prestige of the journals in which they appear, reflecting decisions \nby the editor and referees employed by that journal. The extent to which other authors \ncite the papers may also be taken into account, and with books, the comments of \nreviewers may carry some weight. \n \nLikely motives of publishers, booksellers and editors are to earn an honest living and \nprosper, influenced or even dominated by enthusiasm for the science. The enthusiasm \nis likely to be shared by the referee and reviewer, possibly reinforced by a desire to \nremain in the network. Catalogers, curators and librarians are normally paid for their \nwork, although this by no means rules out enthusiasm. They influence what is \navailable and who sees it. Readers are presumably the most important participants, \nbeing the ultimate beneficiaries of the system\u2019s existence. Their motives are \npresumably to gain information for a variety of reasons, including curiosity, which \nreflect their business concerns. In the circumstances, their role is a surprisingly \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part I (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \npassive one. They seem to have little direct influence on the evaluation, operating \ninstead through intermediaries or in their other roles such as authors or referees. The \ncost of the system is largely paid, not directly by the readers, but by government or \ninstitutional support for libraries. Publication costs may be recovered, but seldom the \ncost of the underlying research, which is paid for by other means. \n \nIn due course, these tasks will be handled differently. Any new structure must \nhowever incorporate the legacy of earlier information and work practices. The \nalterations and extensions which new technology is introducing need a solid \nfoundation in the conventional knowledge base. \n \n9. References \n \nAddis, T. R., 1985.
