Optically luminous quasars\nhost the most prodigious accreting black holes in the Universe and can account for >\u223c 30 % of the\ntotal cosmological black-hole growth2,3. As typical quasars are not, however, undergoing intense star\nformation and already host massive black holes (> 108 M\u2299)\n4,5, there must have been an earlier pre-\nquasar phase when these black holes grew (mass range \u2248 106\u2013108 M\u2299). The likely signature of this\nearlier stage is simultaneous black-hole growth and star formation in distant (i.e., z > 1; > 8 billion light\nyears away) luminous galaxies. Here we report ultra-deep X-ray observations of distant star-forming\ngalaxies that are bright at submillimetre wavelengths. We find that the black holes in these galaxies\nare growing almost continuously throughout periods of intense star formation. This activity appears\nto be more tightly associated with these galaxies than any other coeval galaxy populations. We show\nthat the black-hole growth from these galaxies is consistent with that expected for the pre-quasar\nphase.\nThe most intense sites of star formation at high\nredshift are associated with submillimetre galaxies\n(SMGs)6\u22129. SMGs are amongst the most bolometrically\nluminous galaxies in the Universe (LBOL \u2248 10\n13 L\u2299) and\nthe majority of the population is coeval with the peak in\nquasar activity (i.e., z \u2248 1.5\u20133.0)7,9. The apparent associ-\nation of SMGs with some quasars and the similarity in the\ncomoving space densities of SMGs and optically luminous\n(MB < \u221224) quasars (when corrected for probable source\nlifetimes) provides direct evidence for an evolutionary con-\nnection between SMGs and quasars5,10,11. However, in\ncontrast to quasars, the bolometric output of SMGs ap-\npears to be dominated by powerful star-formation ac-\ntivity and any black-hole accretion [i.e., Active Galac-\ntic Nuclei (AGN) activity] is comparatively weak12,13.\nGiven the large available molecular gas supply (typi-\ncally \u2248 3 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299)\n14, SMGs can fuel this luminous\nstar-formation activity for \u2248 108 yrs (ref 14,15). Vari-\nous pieces of complementary observational support have\nalso shown that SMGs are massive galaxies (typically\n\u2248 1011 M\u2299), suggesting that they will become >\u223cM\u2217\nspheroid-dominated galaxies in the local Universe14,16,17.\nAGN activity has been identified in many SMGs6,12.\nHowever, the difficulty in obtaining high-quality optical\nspectra and reliable source redshifts has hindered a com-\nplete census of AGN activity in SMGs. We have initiated\na project investigating the properties of AGNs in SMGs\nusing deep optical spectroscopic data (obtained with the\n10-m Keck telescope)9 and ultra-deep X-ray observations\n(the 2 Ms Chandra Deep Field-North; CDF-N)18. As\nX-ray emission appears to be an ubiquitous property of\nAGNs that is comparatively impervious to obscuration,\nthe combination of these deep datasets provides a detailed\ncensus of AGN activity in SMGs. Here we focus on the\nrole of black-hole accretion in SMGs and the growth of\nblack holes in massive galaxies. The assumed cosmology\nis H0 = 65 km s\n\u22121 Mpc\u22121, \u2126M = 1\/3, and \u2126\u039b = 2\/3.\nThe parent SMG sample comprises 20 submillimetre\ndetected (with the SCUBA camera on the James Clerk\nMaxwell Telescope) sources in the CDF-N region whose\npositions have been reliably located from their radio emis-\nsion and which could then be spectroscopically targeted9.\nThese sources have overall properties consistent with\nthe general SMG population (S850\u00b5m \u2248 4\u201312 mJy and\nz = 0.56\u20132.91, with the majority at z > 2)6\u22129. Seventeen\n(\u2248 85%) of the 20 SMGs are detected at X-ray energies. A\ndetailed investigation of the nature of the X-ray emission\nhas revealed AGN activity in at least 15 (\u2248 75%) SMGs19;\nthe properties of these sources are given in Table 1. The\nX-ray properties of the other 5 (\u2248 25%) SMGs are con-\nsistent with those expected from luminous star-formation\n2Figure 1. Black-hole mass accretion rates. SMGs (filled\ncircles), and a comparison sample of MB < \u221224 quasars\n(dots) are shown4. The error bars represent the estimated\nuncertainty in the X-ray to bolometric correction for AGN\nactivity in SMGs; see Table 1. The solid and dashed\ncurves indicate the median and interquartile ranges for\nthe comparison quasar sample. The dotted line indicates\nthe approximate Eddington-limited mass accretion rate\nfor an \u2248 108 M\u2299 black hole (MBH(Edd)). The SMGs have\nmass accretion rates approximately an order of magnitude\nlower than those of coeval quasars4, suggesting that their\nblack holes are smaller (typically \u2248 107\u2013108 M\u2299); see text\nfor additional black-hole mass constraints.\nactivity, but we note that at least one shows evidence for\nAGN activity at near-infrared wavelengths16.\nTwo different observing modes were used in construct-\ning the SMG sample: 14 of the radio sources were specif-\nically targeted with SCUBA observations and 6 of the\nradio sources were detected in blank-field SCUBA maps.\nAlthough targeting known radio sources with SCUBA ob-\nservations could potentially bias our AGN fraction owing\nto contributions to the radio emission from AGN activ-\nity, a statistical analysis does not reveal a strong AGN\nbias in our sample (P=1.0, two-sided Fisher\u2019s exact test);\nsee Table 1 for the observing modes of the X-ray classi-\nfied AGNs. However, due to the large positional uncer-\ntainties of SCUBA sources (\u2248 6\u20137 arcseconds), redshifts\ncould not be obtained for the \u2248 35\u201350% of the radio-\nundetected SMG population, some of which might host\nAGN activity6,9. Making the conservative assumption\nthat none of the radio-undetected SMGs hosts AGN ac-\ntivity, our X-ray data alone suggest an AGN fraction in\nthe SMG population of > 38+12\n\u221210%. We note that a similar\nfraction of comparably luminous galaxies in the local Uni-\nverse host AGN activity22, although their space density is\napproximately 3 orders of magnitude smaller than SMGs.\nThe large AGN fraction in the SMG population indi-\ncates that their black holes are growing almost continu-\nously throughout the intense star-formation phase of these\ngalaxies [i.e., assuming that all SMGs are growing their\nblack holes, the AGN duty cycle is > 38+12\n\u221210%]. This sug-\ngests that the black holes and galaxy spheroids are grow-\ning concordantly in SMGs1. Such a close association be-\ntween AGN and star-formation activity is not seen in the\ncoeval field galaxy population or other coeval star-forming\ngalaxy populations (\u2248 3\u201315% AGN fraction)23,24. The al-\nmost continuous black-hole growth in SMGs suggests that\nthere is an abundance of available fuel, hinting that the\naccretion may be occurring efficiently (i.e., at or close to\nthe Eddington limit), as predicted by theoretical studies\nof the growth of massive black holes25\u221227. The majority\n(\u2248 85%) of the AGNs are obscured (see Table 1), as also\npredicted for black holes undergoing efficient growth25.\nThe unobscured X-ray luminosities of the AGNs (LX \u2248\n1043\u20131044 erg s\u22121) suggest that the mass accretion rates\nare modest ( <\u223c 1M\u2299 yr\n\u22121); see Table 1 and Figure 1. By\ncomparison to coeval quasars, the mass accretion rates in\nSMGs are approximately an order of magnitude lower,\nalso suggesting modest black-hole masses (i.e., \u2248 107\u2013\n108 M\u2299; see Table 1 and Figure 1). Although these black-\nhole mass estimates are uncertain, the narrowness of the\nbroad emission lines (BELs; typical full-width half maxi-\nmum velocities of \u2248 2500 km s\u22121)16, when they are visible,\nalso suggest black-hole masses of < 108 M\u2299 (ref 4). As\nwell-studied AGNs with narrow BELs are found to be ac-\ncreting at (or even beyond) the Eddington limit4, this pro-\nvides further support for the idea that the mass accretion\nrate in SMGs is approximately Eddington limited. Under\nthe assumption of Eddington-limited accretion, the black\nholes in the SMGs will grow by up to an order of mag-\nnitude over their \u2248 108 yr star-formation lifetime. These\noverall properties are consistent with those expected for\nmassive galaxies undergoing rapid black-hole growth.\nThe total black-hole growth from SMGs can be cal-\nculated by integrating the average accretion density over\nthe SMG redshift range; see Figure 2. Over the redshift\ninterval z = 1.8\u20133.0 (corresponding to 80% of the SMGs\nstudied here), the black-hole density produced by SMGs\nis \u2248 6+11\n\u22124 \u00d7 10\n3 M\u2299 Mpc\n\u22123. To put this quantity into\ncontext we need to compare it to the black-hole growth\nfrom coeval quasar activity. Considering only quasars in\nthe luminosity range ofMB = \u201324 to \u201327 (the majority of\nwhich reside in >\u223cM\u2217 spheroid-dominated galaxies\n28 and\nhave the properties consistent with being the progeny of\nSMGs5), the total SMG black-hole density is \u2248 13+27\n\u22129 % of\nthe black-hole growth from quasar activity2. These con-\nstraints should be considered lower limits since further\npre-quasar growth at z = 1.8\u20133.0 may be produced by\n3radio-undetected SMGs and galaxies with fainter submil-\nlimetre fluxes, if they host AGN activity. However, these\nresults are consistent with, for example, SMGs undergo-\ning an intense black-hole growth phase, where the black\nhole is grown from \u2248 107 to \u2248 108 M\u2299, prior to a high\naccretion-rate quasar phase, where the black hole is grown\nfrom \u2248 108 to \u2248 8 \u00d7 108 M\u2299. In this scenario, although\nSMGs do not produce a large fraction of the cosmologi-\ncal black-hole density, they are responsible for the crucial\npre-quasar phase where the black holes in massive galax-\nies are rapidly grown. Indeed, the total black-hole growth\nfrom SMGs could only exceed that from quasar activity if\nthe quasar lifetime is insufficient to double the mass of the\nblack hole (i.e., < 3\u00d7107 yrs assuming Eddington-limited\naccretion). Overall, this picture is in good agreement with\ndirect theoretical predictions of the black-hole growth of\nSMGs and quasars26,27.\nWhat was the catalyst for the rapid black hole and\nstellar growth seen in SMGs? Rest-frame ultra-violet im-\nages taken by the Hubble Space Telescope have shown\nthat a considerably larger fraction of SMGs are in ma-\njor mergers (i.e., the merging of two galaxies of compa-\nrable masses) than has been found in the coeval galaxy\npopulation17,29. Hydrodynamical simulations have shown\nthat major mergers can efficiently transport material to-\nward the central regions of galaxies, providing an effective\nmechanism to trigger nuclear star formation and fuel the\nblack hole30. The result of these major mergers is thought\nto be massive spheroid-dominated galaxies. Ultra-deep X-\nray observations of SMGs undergoing major mergers have\nshown that AGN activity can be ongoing in both galactic\ncomponents12. Presumably in these major-merger events\nthe black holes will eventually coalesce, further increasing\nthe mass of the black hole in the resultant galaxy.\nReceived 12 October 2004; Accepted 11 February 2005.\n1.

Unobscured rest-frame 0.5\u20138.0 keV luminosity (LX), and the presence of X-ray obscuration (NH > 10\n22 cm\u22122) are taken from ref\n19. The observation mode refers to whether the source was specifically targeted with a SCUBA observation (\u201cT\u201d) or whether the source\nwas detected in a blank-field SCUBA map (\u201cM\u201d): 10 of the AGNs were identified in targeted SCUBA observations and 5 of the AGNs\nwere identified in blank-field SCUBA maps. The mass accretion rate (dM\/dt) is estimated by converting the X-ray luminosity to the\nAGN bolometric luminosity, under the assumption that the X-ray luminosity accounts for 6+12\u22124 % of the bolometric luminosity of the\nAGN (i.e., the range in conversion factors found in ref 20). Although our assumed bolometric conversion factors were originally derived\nfrom unobscured AGNs, while the majority of the AGNs in our sample are obscured, the important issue is the relationship between the\nintrinsic X-ray emission and the ultraviolet-optical accretion disk emission, which is unlikely to be obscuration dependent. We also note\nthat our bolometric conversion factors agree with those estimated for obscured AGNs with similar luminosities (and therefore similar mass\naccretion rates) to the sources studied here3,21. When converting from the bolometric luminosity to the accreted mass we assumed the\ncanonical efficiency of 10% (\u01eb = 0.1). The black-hole mass (MBH(Edd)) is calculated from the mass accretion rate under the assumption\nthat the accretion is Eddington limited; see text for justification. The black-hole masses will be higher if the accretion is sub Eddington;\nsee text for additional black-hole mass constraints.\n14. Greve, T.R., et al.
