A prototype single cell rotary water electrolyser was\nconstructed and a number of design challenges with regard to the practical application were\naddressed. The rotary electrolyser was tested over a range of current density, centrifugal\nacceleration, electrolyte concentration, temperature and electrode geometry. The test results\nshowed that at normal cell operating conditions (7.7 M KOH solution, 348 K) much of the cell\nvoltage benefits were achieved at an acceleration of about 16 g (g=9.81 m s-2 ) equivalent to a\nrotational speed of 500 rpm (revolution per minute) for the rotary cell. The rotary electrolyser cell\nvoltage was about 0.25-0.5 V less than the equivalent static cell under similar operating conditions,\ndepending on the current density. The cell voltages achieved, without an effective electrode\ncatalytic coating, were comparable with typical industrial values of fully developed pressurised\ncells. At a higher acceleration of 41 g, the rotary cell\u2019s current density can be up to 13.5 kA m-2\nwithout causing gas bubble blinding of the membranes and electrodes. When comparing with\ntypical current densities (about 5 kA m-2 ) found in commercial systems, this work demonstrated\nthe potential of intensification.\nKey words\ncentrifugal field, process intensification, water electrolysis, hydrogen production\n11 Introduction\nProcess intensification is a strategy for process plant construction which involves the development of\nequipment having volumes which are typically at least two orders of magnitude smaller than those of\ntheir conventional equivalents. The initial incentive for this approach was the reduction in plant system\ncost which may be achieved when lower installation costs attributable to pipe work, support structure\nand civil engineering items such as roads\/foundations, are taken into account. Subsequently, it has been\nrecognised that the other benefits of an intensified plant may be as important as its initial cost. For\nexample, intrinsic safety is improved due to the dramatically decreased inventories of potentially\nhazardous process fluids. Also process response times are much shorter in intensified equipment\nleading to the feasibility of \u201cjust-in-time\u201d manufacture of products (e.g. pharmaceuticals, fine\nchemicals, paints etc.) that would otherwise be made in batches, with all that implies in terms of\nwarehouse and stock costs. Of greater interest in the context of the present work is the recognition that\nthe thermodynamic efficiency of a given process is intimately linked to the irreversibilities incurred in\ntransferring heat, mass and momentum within the key unit operations.\nThe practical application of process intensification depends on our ability to devise fluid dynamic\nenvironments which stimulate high transfer coefficients for heat and mass so that for a given set of\nintrinsic chemical kinetics, they do not limit the overall system output. Among a variety of methods to\nfacilitate the heat mass and momentum transfers, the centrifugal field method perhaps is the most\nwidely applied technique to processes involving two phases, e.g. absorption, distillation, extraction and\nphase separation[1-10]. Generally speaking the attainment of high transfer coefficients allows us to\nreduce temperature and concentration differentials and, thus, thermodynamic irreversibilities. In an\nelectrolytic operation this can result in a substantial reduction in cell voltage particularly at high current\ndensities as will be shown below.\nIn any multiphase system the fluid dynamic behaviour is largely dictated by the buoyancy force which\nis a function of the buoyancy term G\uf072\uf044 where \uf072\uf044 is the phase density difference and G is the applied\nacceleration. At very low levels of gravity(acceleration), such as those encountered in free fall or in\nspace vehicles, interfacial forces dominate system behaviour so that bubbles are large and phase slip\nvelocities are low. This leads to a very poor heat and mass transfer environment. Some observations\nof water electrolysis have been made under these conditions by two Japanese groups, one working with\na 700 meter drop tower [11], and the other [12] using an aircraft in a parabolic flight trajectory for 25 s.\nPhotographs of the operating electrodes are reproduced in Figure 1 where it can be seen that there are\nsignificant differences between the features of bubble formation around the electrode under the\nconditions of terrestrial gravity (Figure 1(a)) and microgravity (Figure 1(b)) [11]. It is evident that\noperation at these micro levels of gravity incurs several problems:\n\uf0b7 Bubbles adhere to the electrode\n\uf0b7 Bubbles adhere to the membrane\n\uf0b7 High gas volume fractions build up in the electrolyte and impair its conductivity\n2\uf0b7 Electrode spacing has to be increased so as to facilitate bubble removal\nIt will be recognised that all these factors adversely influence the cell voltage. The obvious expectation\nfollowing the above observations is that the imposition of higher accelerations on a water electrolysis\ncell will effectively prevent bubble blinding of the membranes and electrodes ensuring a very low gas\nvolume fraction in the electrolyte. The other effect is that the enhanced bubble buoyancy occurs exactly\nwhere it is needed to increase the electrode mass transfer coefficient, i.e. within the boundary layer.\nWith bubble disengagement no longer a problem the electrodes can be brought closer together and\npossibly structured to give high surface area. This further reduces the cell resistance and the effective\ncurrent density.\nGas disengagement in an electrolysis cell can be facilitated via forming shear flow on electrode surface\nby using a variety of methods, e.g. fluid rotation, oscillation and vibrations, in cell. For example, in a\nrotating electrolyser presented in a patent by Fleischmann et al [13], separated shear flows were formed\non two discs rotating in a pool of electrolyte. No detailed performance information was included in the\npatent.\nAs far as it can be ascertained, the idea of exploiting centrifugal acceleration fields for facilitating gas\ndisengagement was first proposed for water electrolysis in a very brief patent by Thomson in 1929\n[14]. This document presented a simple sketch but gave no performance details. Much later a patent by\nHoover [15] described a rotating chlor-alkali cell, however there were also no performance details\nrevealed. The concept was further extended by Ramshaw [1] who also used a chlor-alkali cell with a\nNafion membrane. The rotating unit (1 m long by 0.5 m diameter) comprised a 20% segment of two\nopposing spinning disc planar electrodes which were coated with an appropriate electro-catalysis.\nBearing in mind that the standard ICI FM21 cell voltage when operating at 3.0 kA m-2 was 3.17V, it\nwas found that the rotating unit when operated at accelerations up to 200 g (about 900 rpm) gave very\nsignificant energy savings. There appeared to be little point in exceeding this level of acceleration for\nthat particular cell configuration. At 5.0 kA m-2 the voltage reductions were even greater. The author\nnoted that with conventional lubrication, the energy needed to maintain the cell rotation at the modest\nspeeds is small compared with the large energy saving to be made in a realistic industrial application.\nIn 2002 Cheng et al. [16] investigated chlor-alkali electrolysis in a conventional laboratory centrifuge\nusing acidified brine and at temperatures up to 353 K. The relationship between cell performance and\nthe relative acceleration was evaluated using electrodes which comprised RuO2-TiO2\/Ti mesh and Pt\/Ti\nmesh. Once again, very significant cell voltage reductions were generated when accelerations up to 190\ng were applied. For example a reduction of 0.6 V was observed at a current density of 6.0 kA m-2. In\naddition the electrode mass transfer coefficient increased from 1.28\uf0b4 10-5 m s-1 to 3.89\uf0b4 10-4 m s-1.\nThis feature is expected to improve the current efficiency for chlorine production.\nCheng et al. [17] also investigated water electrolysis with brine in the laboratory centrifuge. Once again\nit was demonstrated that centrifugal fields provided a powerful means for improving the electrolytic\nprocess, especially when nickel foam electrodes were used with concentrated potassium hydroxide\nsolutions at 353 K. Cell voltage reductions in an un-optimised cell arrangement varied from 0.36 V at\n3.0 kA m-2 current density.\n3From the above studies, it is clear that there is a significant body of evidence confirming that the\napplication of enhanced acceleration to an electrolysis operation can result in major improvement to its\nenergy efficiency. However, the experimental set up was not representative of industrial scale devices.\nThe electrodes were immersed in a pool of electrolyte and rotating together inside a centrifuge. There\nwas no consideration of many practical issues such as how to replenish electrolyte in the cell nor how\nto introduce a large electric current into to the rotating electrodes, etc. The tests were also limited, for\nexample, the effect of electrode structure was not reported. The current densities used in tests were less\nthan 6.0 kA m-2. There was also a lack of detailed information about the power consumption and\nenergy efficiency of the cell.\nThe work reported in this paper is intended to address some of the practical issues of designing an\nindustrial scale rotating electrolyser. A single cell rotating electrolyser was constructed to examine the\neffects of applied acceleration, structure of electrodes and electrolyte concentration on performance.\n2 Experimental setup\nThe present study used a preliminary prototype configuration which can be loosely described as a\nsingle 0.2 m diameter spinning disc cell with a capability of running at up to 1,000 rpm at a current\ndensity of up to 20 kA m-2. (In this paper a current density is defined in terms of electrolysis current\nand projected area of the electrodes, unless specified otherwise). The general arrangement is presented\nin Figure 2 where it can be seen that the cell is held on a hollow shaft which is supported between two\npillow block bearings. Current is transmitted to the cell from one end of the shaft to the other via two\nrotary mercury-based encapsulated connectors.\nDuring the process of configuring the experimental prototype the following issues, which were\nexpected to be important for industrial application, were addressed.\n2.1 Current supply to the rotary cell\nConsiderable thought has been given to the question of current supply to the rotating cell as the\nenvisaged current level at industrial scale is expected to be at least 1,000 A for 0.5 m diameter cells in a\nbi-polar array. Several connection arrangements, e.g. slip ring assemblies, molten metal baths and\nmercury-based encapsulated connectors were considered and carefully appraised. The last two schemes\nwere studied extensively.\nFor the molten metal bath trial, Cerrobend\uf0d4 was identified as the alloy of choice as its melting point\nwas approximately 343 K and has relatively low content of toxic cadmium. It appeared to be capable of\ncoping with high currents while operating with low mechanical drag and low voltage drop. The\nexperimental arrangement comprised of a disc which was attached to the shaft. The disc was partially\nimmersed in a narrow bath of molten alloy. The alloy was heated to a controlled target temperature by\nimmersed cartridge heaters and the system was shrouded by a cover plate to retain any liquid alloy\nspray. Early results were encouraging with voltage losses less than 0.1V at currents of 100 A.\n4Unfortunately, after several hours of operation at temperatures around 353 K, the alloy melt developed\na mousse-like consistency which ultimately caused the bath contents to overflow. Despite exhaustive\nenquiries and investigation, no means could be found to avoid this problem and so the molten alloy\nexperiments were suspended.\nThe trial of mercury-based encapsulated connector was then carried out using a commercially available\nproduct from Nova Ltd. The unit was capable of transmitting up to 250 A at speeds up to 1200 rpm and\ngenerated very little mechanical drag. It retained the mercury in a hermetically sealed cylinder and did\nnot therefore present a safety problem. The dimensions of the connector cylinder are 31 mm in\ndiameter by 28 mm in length. These units were installed at each end of the shaft and have operated\nvery effectively and reliably. Tests showed that the voltage drop across the connector at a current of\n200 A and a rotation speed of 800 rpm was about 0.06 V The heat generated from the connectors was\nmoderate and the temperature rise during tests was very limited. More importantly, a 100 mm diameter\nconnector should be able of dealing with a current of 1000 A -- a reasonable industrial scale.\n2.2 Rotary electrolysis cell design\nThe cell is shown in detail in Figure 3. It is symmetrical about its mid plane, which corresponds to the\nporous polypropylene membrane used to separate the anode and cathode compartments. The membrane\nwas grafted polypropylene meltblown TR0950DG1 (0.125 mm thick) which was provided by\nHollingsworth & Vose Co. It allows free passage of the alkaline electrolyte while keeping the hydrogen\nand oxygen gas bubbles separate. The gas bubbles rise inwards to the hollow machine shaft where they\nare allowed to mix before leaving via the end of the shaft. It must be emphasised that this arrangement\nis only a temporary expedient for simplicity in this laboratory rotary cell, recognising that at the modest\ngas productions involved here, the hazard represented by the flammable gas mixture is unlikely to be\nsignificant. This approach is clearly unacceptable for a full scale unit. However it should be relatively\nsimple to \u2018compartmentalise\u2019 the shaft to provide separate paths for the hydrogen and oxygen.\nIf the full disc area were to be electrochemically activated then the total current demand would be up to\n600 A \u2013 a level that was deemed to be too high for the rotary connectors ultimately employed in this\nlaboratory study. In view of this, most of the cell projected area was rendered inactive by incorporating\na non conducting blank sheet which left two 45\u00b0 sectors active as shown in Figure 4. The projected area\nof each sector was 11 cm2 thus the total projected area was 22 cm2. The current was supplied to and\nremoved from the electrodes by a current feeder made of stainless steel sheet which was in direct\ncontact with the electrodes. A gap (which was adjustable by using the blank sheets of different\nthickness) to facilitate gas disengagement was provided between the electrode and the polypropylene\nmembrane by a non-conducting spacer sheet as shown. At the cell periphery the electrolyte solution\nflows through a set of holes from the feeder channel to the removal channel via the anode and the\ncathode compartments. When operating, the feeder channel contained an annular pool of electrolyte\nsolution which was continuously fed via a stationary tube near the machine shaft. With the assistance\nfrom a peristaltic abstraction pump, the electrolyte was fed at flow rates of around 2.0\uf0b4 10-4 kg s-1. The\nelectrolyte, having passed through the cell, entered the removal channel which contained another\n5annular pool of electrolyte with its inner radius dictated by the position of the stationary abstractor\ntube. It was expected that with continuous electrolyte replenishment and efficient gas disengagement,\nthe electrolyte properties, e.g. concentration and temperature, were kept reasonably stable in the cell.\nThe electrodes (both anode and cathode) were made from nickel mesh comprising 0.224 mm diameter\nwire and with 40 meshes per inch. This gives a surface area to projected area ratio of 2.22 for each\nmesh. An image of the material is shown in Figure 4.\nThe rotary electrolyser was set up in an enclosure, in order to prevent the potential spillage of\nelectrolyte solution from the cell. In addition, the temperature of the enclosure and hence the rig could\nbe raised above the ambient temperature, by using a hot air blower.\n2.3 Instrumentation for the rotary cell\nIt was essential that the rig should include means of data acquisition to abstract the operating data from\nthe rotating system. The key data required were the anode\/cathode voltage drop across the cell\nterminals and the electrolyte solution temperature which was measured by a thermocouple. The\nthermocouple sensing junction was submerged in the solution in removal annular pool of the cell. This\ninformation could be transmitted via a light multi-channel slip ring assembly. However, it was known\nthat such a system could corrupt voltage signals due to the frictional heating of the tracks in\ncombination with the Peltier effect. Accordingly, it was decided to use a digital telemetry system which\nwas provided by Astech Ltd. This was capable of measuring voltage signals with resolutions of \uf0b1 2.5\nmV. The telemetry system proved to be very satisfactory. For electrolyte solution temperature\nmeasurement the uncertainty was about \uf0b11.0 K.\nThe power supply for the electrolyser was an HP\/Agilent 6671A. It is able to deliver a very stable and\nprecise current up to 220 A or a voltage up to 8 V. The power supply was calibrated before it was put\nin use. This power supply was also used for the tests of a static electrolysis cell specified below.\n2.4 Static electrolysis cell\nIn order to provide a comparison with conventional technology, a set of preliminary tests was also\nperformed in a static cell which operated under similar conditions to those used for the rotary cell. A\nschematic of the static rig is showed in Figure 5. Electric current was supplied to the electrolyser sitting\nin a water bath. The electrolysis cell comprised of an anode, a cathode and an isolation membrane in\nbetween. The electrode dimension is 5.0 cm by 5.0 cm, however some portion of the electrodes could\nbe blocked off using an insulation film if a smaller active area was needed. The isolation membrane\nwas used to separate the oxygen and hydrogen produced, simulating its counterpart of industrial water\nelectrolysers. The membrane material used was that used in the rotary electrolyser described above.\nThe inter-electrode gap of the cell could be adjusted using spacers of different thickness. Meanwhile\ndifferent geometries of spacer designs could also provide different geometries of electrolyser cells. The\npreliminary investigations included the effects on the cell voltage due to electrode material and\n6structure, electrolyte concentration and temperature. Obviously, the static cell was subjected to\nterrestrial gravity.\nAlthough the static cell was very different from the rotary cell in geometrical configurations and\nelectrolyte circulation arrangement, and therefore unable to provide a perfect comparison with the\nrotary cell, it was considered to be a useful reference case for the investigation of the effect of\ncentrifugal field on gas disengagement.\n3 Experiment Results\nA large number of tests were performed for both the static and rotary cells at a range of current density,\ncentrifugal acceleration, electrolyte concentration, and electrode geometry. During each test, fresh\nelectrolyte solution was continuously replenished into the cell. Cell voltage and bulk temperature of\nthe electrolyte were continuously recorded at a sample rate of 20 Hz. With this sample rate we were\nable to record not only the stationary component of these parameters, but also variations caused by\ninter-electrode gas movement. The latter proved valuable for interpreting the performance of gas\ndisengagement in the cell. The cell voltage was simultaneously logged with the bulk temperature. This\nenabled the effect of temperature on cell voltage to be studied.\n3.1 Preliminary tests performed using the static cell\n3.1.1 Effect of electrode structure\nA major influence of electrode structure on cell voltage was observed in tests performed with the static\ncell. Figure 6 shows cell voltage data obtained for two different designs, namely, nickel mesh upon the\nstainless steel current feeding plate, and the stainless steel current feeding plate only. The conditions\nfor the experiment were as follows: electrolyte, 7.7 M KOH solution; inter-electrode spacing 2.0 mm.\nAs can be seen in Figure 6, at a solution bulk temperature 348 K, with a current density of less than 10\nkA m-2 there were no significant differences among cell voltages for the two electrode structures.\nHowever notable differences were observed when the current density was higher than 10 kA m-2. This\nbehaviour is presumed to be due to a) the different electrolytic kinetics with different materials and b)\nthe nickel mesh gave extra active electrode surface thereby enhancing the performance. These factors\nbecome much more critical for reducing the cell voltage at a high current density.\nFurther tests were carried out on the effect of extra activated area. Figure 7 shows data obtained with\nelectrodes comprised of different number of nickel mesh layers. The electrolyte used was 7.7 M KOH\nat a bulk temperature of 348 K. The inter-electrode spacing was 2.0 mm. The cell voltage tended to\nreduce with the increase in the number of mesh layers at a fixed current density over the whole range of\nthe current density tested. The benefit in cell voltage reduction with multiple mesh layers was most\nmarked at high current density. This result again suggests that using an electrode with a high surface-\nto-volume ratio helps in reducing the cell voltage and thus improves energy efficiency in water\nelectrolysis.\n7Test results with the static cell also showed that the cell voltage was significantly affected by the inter-\nelectrode spacing, particularly at high current densities. Figure 8 shows the cell voltage traces obtained\nfrom the cell inter-electrode spacings of 1.0 mm and 3.0 mm and the electrode used comprised of one\nlayer of nickel mesh upon the stainless steel current feeding plate. Again the electrolyte used was 7.7 M\nKOH at a bulk temperature of 348 K. It shows that for a fairly high current density (10 kA m-2),\nelectrode spacing has a strong influence on the cell voltage behaviour. Not only the cell voltage with a\nlarger gap is reduced, it also shows much less variability. Presumably this was due to easier inter-\nelectrode gas bubble removal and lower inter electrode void fraction. This indicates that the conflict\nbetween gas disengagement and inter-electrode space is a fundamental problem in designing ultra-\ncompact static cells. One effective way of overcoming this problem is to exploit the benefits of\nintensified fluid dynamic behaviour achievable with enhanced centrifugal fields.\n3.1.2 Effect of electrolyte concentration\nFigure 9 shows cell voltage data obtained at different electrolyte concentrations, 2.0 M, 7.7 M and 11.9\nM KOH. The electrodes were constructed with 3 layers of nickel mesh upon a stainless steel current\nfeeding plate, with an inter-electrode gap of 2.0 mm. The electrolyte solution bulk temperature was 348\nK. As can be seen, due to the increase in gas production, cell voltages for all three concentrations\nincreased with the increase of current density, however major differences were observed between the\ncell voltages at the concentration of 2.0 M and the others. Over the whole range of the current density\ntested, the cell voltage for the 2.0 M solution increased more sharply than for both the 7.7 M and 11.9\nM solutions, however there were no major differences in cell voltages at the concentration of 7.7 M and\n11.9 M.\nThese phenomena were likely because the resistivity of an electrolyte solution is related to its\nconcentration. For a given electrolyte the resistivity of a solution would be inversely proportional to the\nmole concentration of the solution. Therefore the inter-electrode resistance of 2.0 M electrolyte\nsolution will be about 3 times higher than that of 7.7 M solution. However in comparing with the\nresistivity of the 2.0 M solution the resistivity difference between 7.7 M solution and 11.9 M solution\nwould be small.\n3.2 Tests performed in the rotary cell\n3.2.1 The effect of centrifugal acceleration\nFigure 10 shows the dependence of cell voltage on centrifugal acceleration obtained with the rotary\ncell. The electrodes were 3 layers of nickel mesh upon stainless steel current feeding plate with an\ninter-electrode gap of 1.0 mm, operated at current densities from 2.3 to 22.5 kA m-2. The electrolyte\nused was a 7.7 M KOH solution at a bulk temperature of 344 K. The value of the acceleration shown in\nthe figure was a relative value which was calculated by centrifugal acceleration divided by the\ngravitational acceleration, i.e. g=9.81 m s-2. As one can see, the benefit of the centrifugal acceleration\non reducing cell voltages occurred over a fairly large range of the acceleration (over 60 g, equivalent to\n8a speed of 900 rpm for the test rotary cell electrolyser). However the major benefit occurred in the\nlower acceleration range. For example at a current density of 13.5 kA m-2 over 80% of voltage\nreduction was achieved at an acceleration of about 16 g, equivalent to a low rotational speed of 500\nrpm of the rotary cell for all tested current densities. For the current density of 4.5 kA m-2, 95% of\nvoltage reduction was achieved at an acceleration of 16 g. Also the higher the current density, the more\nwas the influence of centrifugal acceleration. A similar tendency was also observed with electrodes\nwith different nickel mesh layer numbers, geometries or materials, operated under similar conditions.\nThe above results are to be expected as the cell voltage in a water electrolysis system is strongly\ninfluenced by the inter-electrode gas removal rate. The electric resistive loss in a water electrolyser is\nmainly due to produced gas bubbles that a) blind electrode surfaces and b) reduce inter-electrode\nconductance with an increasing void fraction in the inter-electrode space. However both of these effects\nare favourably reduced at higher accelerations, particularly when high current densities are involved.\nSimilar to the static cell, the effects of centrifugal acceleration field on inter-electrode bubble\ndisengagement can be observed by following the cell voltage traces. It was believed that the variability\nof the cell voltage reflects the inter-electrode gas\/liquid flow regime. When the large gas bubbles\ncongest and move in the inter-electrode space the flow would be very turbulent and chaotic. This would\ncause the fluctuations of the equivalent electric resistance of the fluids in the inter-electrode space,\nleading to a corresponding cell voltage change. However when the gas bubbles are small in size and the\ninter-electrode void fraction is low, the inter-electrode gas\/liquid mixture would be homogeneous,\ntherefore the inter-electrode resistivity would be stable and so would the cell voltage. Figure 11 shows\ncell voltage traces for the rotary cell operated at different current densities and centrifugal accelerations\n(top) and their positions on the plot of cell voltage against centrifugal acceleration (bottom). The\nelectrodes comprised of 3 layers of nickel mesh upon a stainless steel current feeding plate with 1.0\nmm inter-electrode spacing. Electrolyte used was a 7.7 M KOH solution at a bulk temperature of 344\nK. With a high current density of 13.5 kA m-2 and low acceleration of 3.2 g (i.e. trace (a) in the figure),\nthe inter-electrode gas disengagement was poor, and the cell voltage trace shows large fluctuations with\nan average value of around 2.5V.\nHowever, by either increasing the centrifugal acceleration to 41 g (trace (b) in the figure) or reducing\nthe current density to 2.3 kA m-2 (trace (c) in the figure), voltage fluctuations were damped and levels\nwere lowered, suggesting reduced gas volume fraction in the cell and improved inter-electrode gas\ndisengagement. These results support the theory that the enhanced acceleration field facilitated gas\nbubble removal thus mitigating inter-electrode bubble congestion\/blinding.\nOf practical importance, the results showed that with an increased centrifugal acceleration of 41 g\n(equivalent to a rotational speed 800 rpm of the rig), the gas disengagement between narrowly spaced\nelectrodes was improved significantly even at a current density of 13.5 kA m-2 , which is almost 3 times\nof the operation current density in typical commercial static electrolysers. This demonstrated a\npotential intensification of the electrolysis.\n93.2.2 Effect of electrode activated area\nFigure 12 shows curves of cell voltage against centrifugal acceleration, with electrodes comprising of\ndifferent number of layers of nickel mesh upon a stainless steel current feeding plate all with a 2.0 mm\ninter-electrode gap, operated at a fixed current density of 13.5 kA m-2 at ambient temperature (around\n297 K). The electrolyte was a solution of 7.7 M KOH. As with the static cell, extra layers of nickel\nmesh helped to reduce cell voltage. This was due to the increased effective activated electrode area. It\nis worth noting that similar results were obtained when operated at other current densities.\n3.2.3 Effect of electrolyte temperature and concentration\nFigure 13 shows curves of cell voltage against centrifugal acceleration for a fixed current density of\n13.5 kA m-2, at different electrolyte bulk temperatures. The electrolyte used was a 7.7 M KOH solution.\nThe electrode comprised of 3 layers of nickel mesh upon a stainless steel current feeding plate with a\n2.0 mm inter-electrode gap. Similar to the static cell, a significant cell voltage reduction was observed\nin the rotary cell when the electrolyte temperature was raised from ambient (around 297 K) to 354 K.\nThe test results at other fixed current densities showed a similar trend.\nFigure 14 shows the influence of electrolyte concentration on cell voltage against centrifugal\nacceleration for a fixed current density of 22.5 kA m-2 at ambient temperature. The electrodes were 3\nlayers of nickel mesh upon a stainless steel current feeding plate with a 2.0 mm inter-electrode gap.\nSimilar to the case for the static cell, significant cell voltage reductions were also observed for the\nrotary cell when the concentration of the KOH solution was increased from 2.0 M to 7.7 M. However\nthere was little difference between the cell voltages at KOH concentrations of 7.7 M and 11.9 M. As\nexplained in the results from the static cell tests, this could also be because of the large resistivity\ndifference between 2.0 M solution and the other solutions, and a small resistivity difference between\n7.7 M and 11.9 M solutions. It is worth noting that at 2.0 M KOH and a low centrifugal acceleration\nfield, the cell voltage was so high that it was out of the measuring range of the instruments.\n3.2.4 Energy conversion efficiency of the rotary electrolyser\nIn order to calculate the efficiency of the electrolysis process, the theoretical energy needed is divided\nby the actual energy used by the electrolysis unit to create hydrogen.\nThe reaction of the formation of water is:\nH2 + \u00bd O2 \uf0ae H2O + energy\nAt 298 K and 100 kPa, the heat of formation of liquid water, or the energy released when water is\nformed in the reaction above is 39 kW h kg-1 of hydrogen. This value is the higher heating value\n(HHV) of hydrogen.\nThe electrolysis reaction is the opposite of the formation of water reaction:\nH2O + energy \uf0ae H2 + \u00bd O2\n10\nThe theoretical amount of energy needed to create hydrogen from water using electrolysis is 39.0 kWh\nkg-1.\nFor the rotary electrolyser (electrodes: 3 layers of nickel mesh upon a stainless steel current feeding\nplate; 1.0 mm inter-electrode space; electrolyte: 7.7 M KOH solution, bulk temperature 344 K. c.f.\nFigure 10), the cell voltage was 2.01 V for a centrifugal acceleration of 41 g (corresponding to 800\nrpm) and a current density of 4.5 kA m-2. This corresponds to 53.2 kWh kg-1 required for hydrogen\nproduction. Thus the energy efficiency of the electrolyser was 73%. It is worth noting that in this\ncalculation the energy for driving the rotary cell and feeding electrolyte have not been included, though\nthey were expected to be small in comparison with the energy consumption for electrolysis.\nNonetheless even with this crudely designed rotary electrolyser, which was far from optimised, the\nenergy efficiency is comparable to those of pressurised commercial water electrolysis systems, which\ntypically range up to 73% [18].\n4 Discussions\nThe current density tested with the experimental rotary electrolyser was up to 22.5 kA m-2, based on\nprojected electrode area. At a centrifugal acceleration of 41 g, the electrolyser can be operated at a\ncurrent density of 13.5 kA m-2 without causing bubble congestion in the 1.0 mm inter-electrode space,\nas the gas disengagement is facilitated by the centrifugal field. This current density is much higher than\nthe current density of 4.5 kA m-2, a typical value for conventional optimized electrolysers. The width of\nthe electrolyser cell was about 5.0 mm for three layers of nickel mesh. For a 10 cell stacked unit, the\nactive length is only 50 mm. With further development, very high power density could be possible by\nutilizing the benefit of high applied accelerations.\nIt was noted that with the prototype rotary electrolyser, over 80% of the cell voltage reductions at\ndifferent current density were achieved when the centrifugal acceleration reached around 16 g (at 500\nrpm). This value is much less than that reported by Ramshaw [1], which showed that for a differently\ndesigned brine rotary electrolyser, accelerations in the region of 100-200 g were needed in order to\napproach its asymptotic voltage. This difference may suggest that the acceleration needed for a rotary\nelectrolyser to reach its asymptotic cell voltage is very dependent on its design. Thus when a cell\ndesign involves electrodes having a large current density, leading to bubble congestion, it is to be\nexpected that the voltage performance will be more sensitive to the applied acceleration.\nIn a larger rotor, multiple layers of fine mesh in direct contact with the membrane and current feeder\nmay therefore require a higher acceleration to achieve the optimum operating voltage. Higher\naccelerations allow the capacity of a fully optimised cell configuration to be exploited. A pressurised\nprototype with a more sophisticated electrode design is expected to be more energy efficient and have a\nsignificantly higher operating intensity than existing industrial units.\nThe cell voltage trace showed that both average and fluctuating values increases with inefficient gas\ndisengagement in the cell. This was because that the conductivity of the inter-electrode gas\/liquid\nmixture was reduced and disturbed by bubble congestion. The voltage trace became very calm as the\n11\ngas disengagement was improved at an increased rotational speed. In a practical application, this\nbehavior could be of important interests for the system optimization. The cell voltage can be used to\nmonitor the gas disengagement of a rotary cell and to ensure optimal performance of the system is\nachieved.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nTo establish the feasibility and performance of intensified hydrogen production system using a\ncentrifugal acceleration field, a prototype rotary water electrolyser has been constructed. A number of\ndesign challenges, e.g. rotary electric connector with extremely low resistance and large current\ncapability, were overcome. Extensive tests were performed and the variables covered included current\ndensity ranged from 2.3 to 22.5 kA m-2, centrifugal acceleration up to 70 g, electrolyte concentration\nfrom 2.0 M to 11.9 M KOH, and temperature up to 254 K for a variety of electrode structures.\nEquivalent tests were also performed using a static cell in order to provide reference for comparison.\nCell voltage traces were recorded and used to evaluate the inter-electrode gas disengagement\nperformance. The test results showed that:\n1. At normal cell operating conditions (7.7 M KOH, ~348 K) over 80% cell voltage reductions\nwere achieved at an acceleration less than 16 g (corresponding to low rotational speed of 500\nrpm of the rig) in the tested current density range.\n2. Both static and rotary cell tests showed that an electrode made from multiple layers of nickel\nmesh reduced the cell voltage, presumably due the effective activated area of the electrode\nwas increased.\n3. The rotary cell voltage was about 0.25-0.5 V less than the equivalent static cell under similar\noperating conditions, depending on the current density;\n4. Although the electrodes were without a catalysed coating, operated at a moderately high\ntemperature at atmospheric pressure, the rotary cell voltages achieved were comparable with\ntypical values of fully developed pressurised industrial cells.\n5. It was found that the amplitude of the fluctuations of the cell voltage time trace is a good\nindicator for judging the performance of the gas disengagement in the electrolysis cell. In an\nindustrial application this can be useful to monitor the electrolyer performance as it provides\nan indication that the optimised centrifugal acceleration in the electrolysis cell has been\nreached.\n6. The results suggest a compact intensified electrolyer for hydrogen production is feasible by\nexploiting the centrifugal acceleration provided by rotation.\nAcknowledgements\nWe wish to acknowledge the financial support of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research\nCouncil and the in-kind support of Johnson Matthey Ltd for this study.\n12\nReferences\n1.
