The ceramic top coat, with a thickness of 5-\n25\u00b5m, was deposited via a sol-gel route onto standard MCrAlY and PtAl bond coats. In both the\nerosion and the cyclic oxidation tests it was found that the bond coat had a profound affect on the\nresults. The erosion of the sol-gel coatings were compared to standard EB PVD and PS TBCs\nand were found to be significantly higher. The effect of aging (100hr at 1100\u00b0C) on the erosion\nrates was also evaluated and was found to increase the erosion rates. The information obtained\nfrom the erosion and cyclic oxidation tests have highlighted the need to develop and optimise the\nparameters for producing thicker coatings\nIntroduction\nThe thermomechanical performances of Yttria stabilised Zirconia (YSZ) thermal barrier coatings\nstrongly depend on its microstructure. Currently, the ceramic topcoat is deposited by two main\ntechniques: the Electron Beam Physical Vapour Deposition (EB-PVD) or the plasma spray\nprocess. Both result in highly oriented microstructures; indeed, columnar coatings are\ncharacteristic of the EB-PVD process and the superposition of YSZ lamellas are a characteristic\nof the thermally sprayed coatings. Recently, a soft chemical route, the sol-gel process, has been\ndeveloped in order to produce a topcoat with a non-orientated microstructure. A major difficulty\nwas the fabrication of thick coatings from a liquid phase precursor at temperatures below\n1200\u00b0C. This paper presents the first results concerning the mechanical characterizations of the\nsol-gel coatings obtained on substrates with different roughnesses. First, the erosion performance\nof those coatings was studied and the results compared to the standard EB-PVD and plasma\nsprayed TBCs. Following these erosion studies, the cyclic oxidation behaviour of the sol-gel\ncoatings were examined.\nDetails of the Material Systems Studied and Fabrication of Sol-Gel Thermal Barrier\nCoatings.\nThe sol-gel top coats were prepared by the combination of the dip-coating technique with the\nalkoxyde route [1-2]. The microstructure of the coatings is quite different compared to the\ncolumnar or lamellar oriented ceramic top coat structures normally associated with TBCs.\nIndeed, by using the sol-gel process, the YSZ material and the pore network are randomly\noriented in the coating as shown in Fig. 1.\nFor the characterisation studies and the erosion tests, two bons coat systems were used; a plasma\nsprayed NiCrAlY bons coat, with a surface roughness between 10-15\u00b5m Ra, and a nickel\naluminide bons coat fabricated using the Snecma vapour aluminising process (APVS). The\nsubstrate for these studies was Hastelloy X.\nFor cyclic oxidation studies, the performance of the system is known to depend on the bons\ncoat\/substrate system, thus a (Ni,Pt)Al bons coat was used on a single crystal superalloy\nsubstrate (AM1). The surface roughness of the two vapour aluminised bons coats was within\n1\u00b5m Ra.\nFig. 1 : Cross section micrographs of the random oriented YSZ top-coat obtained via the sol-gel\nroute on the (Ni, Pt)Al\/AM1 substrate, general view (left) and detail of the non oriented\nmicrostructure (right).\nErosion testing\nAll the erosion tests were carried out using the erosion facility at Cranfield University. A\ncompressor supplies a pressure vessel and the air enters the acceleration tube. Then, the erodent\nmaterial is fed via a screw feeder and a venture nozzle into this tube. The compressed air\naccelerates the particles before they impact the test specimen in the chamber. The test samples\nare attached to a carousel, which is capable of holding six different specimens at different angles\nwith respect to the impacting particle stream.\nAll samples (reference TBCs, reference bond coats and sol-gel top coats) were weighed\nbefore the erosion testing and then placed in the carousel. Each sample was then exposed to the\nparticle laden gas stream for 10s (short time exposure) or 30s (long time exposure), for reference\nsamples, after which, and once all the samples had been tested, they were removed from the rig\nand re-weighed. This was repeated for six exposure periods or until coating penetration. Thus,\nthe erosion rate can be reported as mass loss with the units g\/kg, i.e. materials loss in grams per\nkilogram of erodent impacting the sample. The erodent, projected with a 1.5bar pressure, was\nalumina particles with diameter comprised between 63\u00b5m and 65\u00b5m. The tests were all\nconducted at room temperature and 30\u00b0 impact for these experiments.\nCyclic oxidation testing\nThe cyclic oxidation tests were performed using a motorised cyclic oxidation furnace at\nCIRIMAT. Samples were placed on the motorised support and intermittently moved between a\ncool section, maintained at room temperature and a preheated vertical furnace at 1100\u00b0C. The\nhot dwell time was one hour, whereupon the samples were removed to the cool section and\ncooled to room temperature using an air blast. All the tests were performed in laboratory air.\nResults and Discussions.\nCharacterization of the reference samples.\nErosion tests: Table 1 presents the erosion rates obtained for the reference systems studied.\nMoreover the graph Fig. 2 shows the evolution of their mass loss versus the mass of erodent\nprojected at their surfaces. At the beginning of the test, (up to about 0.5g of erodent), it can be\nseen that for each sample, the mass loss is not linear (Fig. 2), after which a linear mass loss is\nattained. This transient mode is associated with the preconditioning of the surface and of the\nsubjacent impacted zone. Then, the evolution of the erosion rate becomes linear and it\ncorresponds to the degradation of the coatings.\nComparing the behaviour of the reference TBCs, it can be seen that the plasma sprayed TBC\nsystem erodes at a faster rate than its EB PVD counter part. In this study the steady state erosion\nrate of the plasma sprayed TBC is twice that of the EB PVD when impacted at 30\u00b0 impact angle.\nThe transient erosion behaviour is much greater with the erosion rate for the rougher plasma\nspray TBC 8 times that of the EB PVD system. This increased transient behaviour is thought to\nbe due to the difference in the initial surface roughness of the two systems. Once a steady state\nerosion condition is established, the erosion performance of the two systems, at 30\u00b0 impact, is\nmuch closer. Previous studies using this erosion rig at 90\u00b0 impact angle [3] has shown that the\nerosion rate of a plasma sprayed and EB PVD TBC differ by a factor of 7 at room temperature\nwith the EB PVD TBC having the lower erosion rate. For glancing angle impact, the erosion rate\nof EB PVD TBCs is known to depend on the difference in orientation of the impacting particle\non the column growth, with a significant increase in the erosion rate for open EB PVD structures\nwhen this difference in orientation exceeds 58\u00b0 [4].\nFor completeness the erosion performance of the bons coat systems were also studied (see\ntable 1 and figure 5). These were significantly lower than for the ceramic systems, as would be\nexpected. A 30\u00b0 impact angle is likely to produce the highest erosion rates for these ductile metal\nsystems. Again a difference is obtained between the erosion behaviour of the NiAl bons coat (by\nCVD) and the plasma sprayed MCrAlY system.\nTable 1 : Erosion rates of reference systems (top coat\/ bond coat \/ Hastelloy X) and (bond coat\/\nHastelloy X).\nReference TBCs :\nYSZ top coat\/Bond coat\/\nHastelloy X\nReference bond coats\n\/ Hastelloy X\nErosion rate\n[g.kg-1]\nYSZ EBPVD\n\/ NiAl\nYSZ Plasma\n\/ NiCrAlY\nNiAl\/Hastelloy\nX\nNiCrAlY\/Hasteloy\nX\nShort time\nexposure 2,8 22,9 2,7 10,7\nLong time\nexposure 2,3 4,6 0,6 1,2\nRa [\u00b5m] 1,5 ~13 0,9 10<Ra<15\nFig. 2 : Mass loss of the reference samples versus the mass of the erodent projected at their\nsurface.\nCharacterization of sol-gel samples. For the sol-gel TBCs the thickness of the TBC produced\ndepends strongly on the roughness of the bons coat to be TBC coated. For the system\n(NiCrAlY\/Hastelloy X), the thickness of the sol-gel top coat (YSZ SG) lies between 5\u00b5m and\n25\u00b5m (5\u00b5m on high points, 25\u00b5m in hollows). This relates to the dip-coating method of\nproduction which can fill the hollows. This is not the case on the NiAl bond coat, which is less\nrough, the thickness of the YSZ SG layer is about 8\u00b5m.\nTable 2 presents the erosion rates of the YSZ SG top coats on the NiCrAlY\/ Hastelloy X and\nNiAl\/ Hastelloy X bond coat systems. As the sol-gel samples are thinner than the traditional\nTBCs, they were only exposed to the erodent particles for a short time of exposure.\nTable 2 : Erosion rates of samples obtained using the sol-gel process.\nSol-gel top coat\nErosion rate\n[g.kg-1]\nYSZ SG \/\nNiAl\/Hastelloy\nX\nYSZ SG \/\nNiCrAlY\/Hasteloy\nX\nShort time\nexposure 10,8 13,5\nLong time\nexposure - -\nRa [\u00b5m] 3,4 10<Ra<15\n0,000\n0,005\n0,010\n0,015\n0,020\n0,025\n0,030\n0,035\n0,040\n0,045\n0 2 4 6 8\nMass erodent (g)\nM\nas\ns\nlo\nss\n(g\n)\nEBPVD reference system\nPlasma reference system\nNiAl bond coat\nNiCrAlY bond coat\n0,000\n0,001\n0,002\n0,003\n0,004\n0,005\n0,006\n0,007\n0,008\n0 0,2 0,4 0,6\nMass erodent (g)\nM\nas\ns\nlo\nss\n(g\n)\nYSZ SG \/ NiCrAlY bond coat\nNiCrAlY bond coat\nFig. 3 : Mass loss of the YSZ SG top coat\ndeposited on the NiCrAlY bond coat versus the\nmass of the erodent projected at their surface.\nFig. 4 : Mass loss of the YSZ SG top coat\ndeposited on the NiAl bond coat versus the\nmass of the erodent projected at their\nsurface.\nThe first thing that one can see from the results of the erosion tests of the thin sol-gel TBCs\ncompared to their respective bond coats, shown in Figure 3 and 4, is that as for the standard\nTBCs their erosion rates are higher than that of the bond coats. It also appears as though the bond\ncoat affects the erosion rate, since the sol-gel TBC on the aluminide bond coat is slightly lower\nthat the TBC on the sprayed bond coat. This is most likely to do the differences in the roughness\nof the bond coats. There are a number of issues to consider when examining these results. The\nmost important is the size of the impacting particle relative to the thickness of the coating. In the\ncase of these sol-gel TBCs the ceramic layer is very thin in the order of 10-20% of the diameter\nof the impacting particles. This means that the bonding of the TBC to the bond coat will play a\nsignificant role in the erosion resistance of the coating while the \u2018bulk\u2019 properties will have less\nof an effect. The other important point is that due to the aforementioned the sol-gel TBCs do not\nattain a steady state erosion rate.\nCharacterization of the aged samples. The systems (YSZ SG\/ bond coat\/ Hastelloy X) were\naged using an isothermal treatment at 1100\u00b0C, for 100 hours. They were then characterized\nunder the same conditions as it was previously described. Table 3 presents the erosion rates of\nthe as deposited sample (noted AD) and those obtained for aged samples (HT for High\nTemperature). Fig. 5 shows the evolution of the mass loss of coating versus the mass of\nimpacting erodent.\nAging was found to increase the erosion rate of both sol-gel deposited TBC systems. This is\nsimilar to previous studies on EB PVD TBCs, where the erosion rate increased by a factor of two\nfollowing aging for 100hr at 1100\u00b0C for a standard EB PVD TBC system[5]. Although in the\ncase of the sol-gel TBC a different mechanism will be operating which is most likely dependent\non the formation and growth of the TGO layer.\n0,000\n0,001\n0,002\n0,003\n0,004\n0,005\n0,006\n0 0,2 0,4 0,6\nMass erodent (g)\nM\nas\ns\nlo\nss\n(g\n)\nYSZ SG \/ NiAl bond coat\nNiAl bond coat\nTable 3 : Erosion rates of the aged samples (HT) prepared using the sol-gel process (YSZ SG),\ncomparison with the as deposited samples (AD).\nErosion rate [g\/kg] YSZ SG \/ NiAl\/Hastelloy X YSZ SG \/ NiCrAlY\/Hasteloy X\nAD HT AD HT\nShort time exposure 11 16 14 19\nFig. 5 : Mass loss of the aged 100hr at 1100\u00b0C and not aged YSZ SG samples versus the mass of\nthe erodent projected at their surface.\nSummary of the erosion tests.\nThis study has shown that, unfortunately, the thin sol-gel TBCs have extremely poor erosion\nresistance to impact by large alumina particles. The erosion rate was found to be 4-5 times higher\nthan standard EB PVD TBCs and 2-3 times higher than standard PS TBCs. Furthermore the\nerosion rate was found to increase 30-40% with aging. Considering the large size of the\nimpacting particles compared to the thickness of the coatings this finding is not surprising. It is\nmost likely that the bonding between the sol-gel TBC and the bond coat has the biggest influence\non the erosion rate.\nCyclic oxidation testing\nDescription of the samples. Thick YSZ sol-gel coatings were deposited on the ((Ni, Pt)Al\/\nAM1) and (NiCrAlY\/ Hastelloy X) systems. On the (Ni, Pt)Al bond coat, the thickness of the\nYSZ layer is equal to 20\u00b5m. For the (NiCrAlY\/ Hastelloy X) substrate, the thickness of the sol-\ngel deposit lies between 18\u00b5m and 80\u00b5m, Micrographs of both systems are illustrated in Figure\n6.\n0,000\n0,002\n0,004\n0,006\n0,008\n0,010\n0,012\n0 0,1 0,2 0,3 0,4 0,5 0,6\nMass Erodent (g)\nM\nas\ns\nlo\nss\n(g\n)\nYSZ SG\/ NiAl\nYSZ SG\/ NiCrAlY\n(YSZ SG\/ NiAl)-\n100hr at 1100\u00b0C\n(YSZ SG\/ NiCrAlY)-\n100hr at 1100\u00b0C\nFig. 6 : Cross section (SEM) of the YSZ SG coating deposited on the ((Ni, Pt)Al\/ AM1) (left)\nand (NiCrAlY\/ Hastelloy X) (right) systems.\nPerformances of the thick YSZ SG coatings during the cyclic oxidation test. The\ndelamination of the YSZ coating deposited on the ((Ni, Pt)Al\/ AM1) systems is observed after\n200 cycles (Fig. 7). It can be observed from the photographs in Figure 7 that a part of the YSZ\nSG layer is still present on the surface of the substrate. Nevertheless, this level of degradation\nimplies the end of the cyclic oxidation test. The delamination of the ceramic top coat was\ninitiated at the edge of the sample and it was observed to propagate progressively across the\nwhole YSZ layer. From a microscopic point of view, Fig. 8 presents the cross section of the\nsample after the cyclic oxidation test. One can note that the YSZ layer is not fissured. Moreover,\nthe delamination of the sol-gel thermal barrier coating takes place at the interface between the\nTGO and the ceramic top coat, with some residual YSZ agglomerates are still bonded to the\nTGO (Fig.8).\nFig. 7 : Images of (YSZ SG\/ (Ni, Pt)Al\/ AM1) sample after 200 cycles of 1 hour at 1100\u00b0C\n(recto : left ; verso : right).\nThe results obtained with the (YSZ SG\/ NiCrAlY\/ Hastelloy X) sample are different. Partial\ndelamination of the YSZ coating is observed after 740 cycles of 1 hour at 1100\u00b0C (Fig. 9). This\nreally encouraging result could be explained by the mechanical anchoring of the sol-gel YSZ\ndeposit onto the surface undulations of the NiCrAlY bond coat. As it was the case for the erosion\ntests, the roughness of the NiCrAlY bond coat makes possible to confine the sol-gel deposit\nwhich allows to reach better mechanical performances.\nFig. 8 : Cross section (SEM) of the (YSZ SG\/ (Ni, Pt)Al\/ AM1) sample after 200 cycles of 1\nhour at 1100\u00b0C.\nFig. 9 : Photograph of the surface of the system (YSZ SG\/ NiCrAlY\/ Hastelloy X) after 740\ncycles of 1 hour at 1100\u00b0C.\nConclusions and perspectives\nThe present paper presents the first erosion and cyclic oxidation tests performed on thin YSZ top\ncoats fabricated using the sol-gel route associated with the dip-coating technique. It has been\nshown that the cyclic oxidation performances of the random orientated ceramic, obtained at low\ntemperature (<1200\u00b0C) by this soft chemistry process, are better when the ceramic layer is\ndeposited on a rough bond coat (NiCrAlY bond coat in this case), however the erosion resistance\nwas found to be better for TBCs deposited onto the smoother PtAl bond coat.\nRecent progress in the development of the protocol allows thicker random orientated YSZ\nlayers to be produced. It will be necessary in the future to compare the thermomechanical\nperformances of sol-gel TBCs with the traditional ones prepared by EB-PVD and plasma\nsprayed processes, keeping an equivalent thickness of the ceramic top coat.\nReferences\n[1] C.
