Therefore,\nthis paper explores this assumption by investigating how multinational corporations (MNCs)\ndefine and use codes in comparison with other corporate social responsibility (CSR) \"tools.\"\nIn the CSR and code literature, this assumption can be found in many works such as Diller\n(1999), Forcese (1997), Alexander (1997), and the ILO (n.d.a. and n.d.b.), where \"code\" is\ndefined without any indication of the content or commitments to be made, however the body of\nliterature focuses on particular areas of importance with regard to CSR issues. For example, the\nUnited States Council for International Business (2004) website corporate responsibility section\nhas a \"position\/statement document\" on codes of conduct, where codes are defined as\n\"commitments voluntarily made by companies, associations, or other organizations that put\nforth standards and principles of business conduct in the marketplace, and are thus primarily\nmarket-driven\" (2000: 2). The definition does not describe content, or the nature of the\nvoluntary commitments to be made by the code. These pages also provide a summary of\ninitiatives such as the US Model Business Principles, UN Global Compact, UN Guidelines for\nCorporate Social Responsibility and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles, Concerning\nMultinational Enterprises and Social Policy, whose purpose is to encourage greater social and\nenvironmental responsibility by corporations. There are no statements that explicitly suggest or\nquestion the assumption that codes are to be used for reasons other than to promote CSR\ncommitments.\nIn some cases, this relationship between codes and CSR is made explicit. Kolk, van Tulder, and\nWelters (1999) define codes of conduct as 'encompass[ing] guidelines, recommendations or\nrules issued by entities within society (adopting body or actor) with the intent to affect the\nbehavior of (international) business entities (target) within society in order to enhance\ncorporate responsibility' (p. 151) (see also Dickerson and Hagen, 1998; and OECD, 2001). As\nwe will see later, Kolk, van Tulder and Welters (1999) distinguish between these \"international\"\ncodes and internal codes \"\u2026 which consist of guidelines for staff on how to behave when\nconfronted with dilemmas such as conflict of interest, gifts, theft, insider trading, pay-offs and\nbribery\" (p. 150), arguing that the internal codes do not address the business-society\nrelationship.\nFor the purposes of this research, CSR is defined as \"the firm's consideration of, and response\nto, issues beyond the narrow economic, technical, and legal requirements of the firm. It is the\nfirm's obligation to evaluate the effects of its decision on the external social system in a manner\nthat will accomplish social benefits along with the traditional economic gains\" (Davis, 1973, p.\n313). The issues are broadly understood to be within the social, environmental, economic\n(Elkington, 1997), and ethical categories. For our purposes, companies must address issues in\nat least two of these categories to be considered to be engaging in CSR. Otherwise the issues\ncould be classed under a single-issue heading such as human rights, environment or labor\nissues.\nSimilarly with codes of conduct, no standard definition exists. Most definitions include the\nfollowings: self-regulatory or voluntary in nature, used to influence behavior of specified\ngroup(s), purpose is to define intentions\/actions regarding a set of issues or towards certain\ngroup(s), sometimes from a market-based perspective (e.g. ILO, n.d.a; ILO, n.d.b; Alexander,\n1997; Forcese, 1997; Diller, 1999; Kolk, van Tulder, and Welters, 1999; OECD, 2001; Kaptein\nand Wempe, 2002).\nTherefore, this paper investigates the assumption in the CSR literature that codes are used\nprimarily to govern CSR issues. This is examined by looking at the reasons corporations give for\nadopting codes, and the characteristics of the codes that they adopt as presented on their\ncorporate websites. The remainder of this paper presents empirical evidence to suggest that\ncodes are not primarily used as governance tools for CSR commitments but are used as\ngovernance tools for other issues such as those requiring compliance, and suggests that to\neffectively understand the complexity of codes and CSR within MNCs, an integrated theoretical\napproach is needed.\nThe findings are used to reflect upon three areas of theoretical import: the uses of CSR and\ncodes in the construction of corporate identity; the amoralisation of business; and CSR and\ncodes as manifestations of the globalisation of management practices.\nRESEARCH PHILOSOPHY AND APPROACH\nThis research is located within a phenomenological interactionist perspective, which sits at the\nfringe of the interpretivist paradigm (Burrell and Morgan, 1979). The phenomenological\ninteractionist assumes a mid-way position between the subjective and objective by suggesting\nthat although there is no reality to test, we can discern patterns in the meanings associated\nwith social action (Burrell and Morgan, 1979), in this case, codes and their relationship to CSR.\nIn exploring the reasons why corporations choose to adopt codes, and in looking at the\ncharacteristics of these same codes, it became clear that in many cases, there was a disconnect\nbetween stated corporate intentions with regard to CSR and the use of codes (e.g. \"CSR means\nwe have a duty to our communities to operate responsibly\" versus codes formalizing rules\nalready enshrined in law and focused on internal workplace issues such as conflict of interest,\ninsider trading, harassment). The literature discussing motivations for code adoption is often\nquite superficial due to the fact that motivations are often not the primary focus of the\ninvestigation. While these authors suggest \"common sense reasons for code adoption, these\nreasons are largely not substantiated with empirical evidence\" (e.g. Diller, 1999; Kolk, van\nTulder, and Welters, 1999; Aaronson and Reeves, 2002; Sethi, 2002; Lenox and Nash, 2003).\nBased on the fact that we observed this pattern early in our investigation, and the lack of\nliterature to support any particular relationship between codes and CSR other than as noted\nabove, we considered it was necessary to conduct exploratory, inductive research (e.g., Proffitt\nand Spicer, 2006) to investigate this relationship in practice. Thus, the research was conducted\nwithout an ideal theory in mind about this relationship and no particular hypothesis to test\n(Eisenhardt, 1989; Crane, 2000) to ensure a rich data set that would help to explain the\nintricacies of any relationship that may or may not exist between codes and CSR.\nTherefore, we investigated the websites of 150 corporations from three countries to determine\nwhat corporations presented as their motivations for adopting codes, and the characteristics of\nthese codes. This was done for four main reasons: first, a corporation's website acts as a\nconduit for the corporation's formal and accepted perspective on a range of issues (Maignan and\nRalston, 2002; Chapple and Moon, 2005). This formalization creates a plausible, legitimate\nversion of the corporation and its activities for the purpose of public consumption (Coupland,\n2003), thereby acting as a form of image standardization on issues it decides to communicate\npublicly not possible with surveys, interviews or case studies (Chapple and Moon, 2005).\nSecond, it is possible to identify the relative significance given to information by the corporation\nbased on how it is presented. For instance, we can assume that information found on the home\npage or in bigger, more visible font is more important for the corporation to communicate than\ninformation that is retrieved after various links or in small print at the bottom of the page.\nTherefore, the Internet can provide the researcher with a general idea of the relative\nimportance of issues on any given website, and taken as whole the site provides a narrative of\nhow the corporation wants to be seen by the public (Coupland, 2003). Third, given the debate\nabout the authenticity and reliability of empirical research in business ethics (Crane, 1999), web\nself-presentations avoid issues of selection bias. Fourth, secondary research is likely to become\nincreasingly more important as access to companies (primary data) continues to decrease\n(Cowton, 1998). Research fatigue has led certain corporations to post more information on their\nwebsites, to which they direct researchers (Ellis, 2004).\nSample Corporations\nThree different countries (the UK, Canada and Germany) were selected to allow for investigation\nof the degree to which national business systems impacted on data collected in the study. The\nUK and Germany represent two very well-documented and contrasting business models within\nEurope. Canada represents a North American business model that, in contrast to the US, was of\nrelatively similar economic size and significance to the UK and Germany.\nA rank order list based on 2002 revenue was used to identify the top MNCs in each country as\nlarger companies are more likely to have codes (Langlois and Schlegelmilch, 1990). The FAME\ndatabase was used for the UK, the June 2003 version of the National Post FP500 business\nranking for Canada, and Hoppenstedt (http:\/\/www.hoppenstedt.de) database for Germany.\nThese databases were selected because they are authoritative sources on corporations found\nwithin the country. The top 50 corporations (as per Maignan and Ralston, 2002 and Chapple and\nMoon, 2005) in each country were identified through a selection process designed to ensure\nthat each company was influenced primarily by the respective national business system,1\nresulting in a total of 150 companies in the sample.\nSpecific Data Collected\nWe collected data on reasons corporations present for adopting codes and the characteristics of\ncodes and CSR signallers (Table 1). CSR signallers were defined as any other tool provided on\nthe website to indicate the corporation's intention to engage in CSR such as policies, reports or\nsignificant websites.\nFour distinctive styles for codes and CSR signallers were identified: stipulative, commitments,\nprinciples and information. The style indicates the basic structure, tone of language, style of\ncontent, associated management objectives and appearance of sanctions or threat of sanctions\nfor non-compliance of code or CSR signaller statements. Stipulative tools require the target\naudience to comply, where words such as \"shall,\"\"will,\"\"required,\"\"shall not,\"\"not permitted\"\netc. are used to indicate the corporations expectations with regard to how individuals will\nbehave on those issues. They may also include sanctions or the threat of sanction for non-\ncompliance. Often these take on a quasi-legal role within the corporation to protect it from\npotentially harmful employee behavior. Commitments based tools specify a set of issues or\nstakeholders of importance and in some cases an indication of how these will be acted upon.\nPrinciples based tools typically indicate a corporation's overarching philosophy on CSR issues\nand may include aspirational statements about the future. Typically these documents indicate\nlittle about how the corporation will act on its statements. Lastly, information based codes tend\nto be made up of information on what has already been done by the corporation and may\nextend to a type of performance reporting.\nTwo general types of codes were identified \u2013 voluntary and mandatory. Mandatory codes are a\nrequirement for corporations determined by governing bodies such as governments (e.g.\nGerman Corporate Governance Code, Canadian privacy legislation), financial regulating bodies\n(e.g. UK Combined Code), or by industry association bodies (e.g. Responsible Care2 in the\nchemical industry).\nAll of the characteristics listed in Table 1 were qualitatively assessed. For all characteristics\nexcept the reasons for adoption, these characteristics were determined through an assessment\nof the code. Reasons for adoption were determined by looking at the code and the entire\ncorporate website, which was searched for any presented justifications that were recorded\nverbatim and categories created using a constant comparative method (e.g. Spiggle, 1994;\nSilverman, 2001).\nThe first 25 companies from each country were collected and analysed for the first phase,\nfollowed two months later by collection and analysis of the second group of 25 for each country.\nThe primary researcher collected all data on Canada and the UK, and the German data was\ncollected with the help of a bilingual German-English speaker. The German data was therefore\ncollected in the presence of the primary researcher, with cross-referencing where possible to\nthe English version of German corporate sites.\nTable 1\nCorporate Information and Code\/ CSR Signaller Characteristics Collected\nInformation\nRecorded\nCriteria\nNames\nCriteria\nParameters Justification\nC\no\nd\ne\n\/\nC\nS\nR\nS\nig\nn\na\nlle\nr\nC\nh\na\nra\nct\ne\nri\nst\nic\ns Code\/CSR\nsignaller\nExists\nYes\/No Indicates whether further information needs\nto be gathered\nCode\/CSR\nsignaller\nDate\nDate if\nmentioned\nIndicate length of use within the company\nName of\nCode\/CSR\nsignaller\nName of\ncode\/CSR\nsignaller as\nlisted on\nwebsite\nLabel given to code may provide clue for\nother information such as target audience\n(e.g. Rolls Royce Supplier\/Partner Code of\nConduct), also used to trace history of code\nand name changes through corporation\nStyle of\nCode\/CSR\nsignaller\n1.

For instance, Anglo American's Good\nCitizenship: Our Business Principles, we can\nassume that the principles and the text\nsurrounding them indicate how the company\nunderstands corporate citizenship and the\nways in which they will work to achieve their\ncitizenship goals. From BAT's Standards of\nBusiness Conduct we can assume that this\ncode is interested only in ensuring employees\ndo not behave in certain ways such as being\ninvolved in conflicts of interest, bribery or\ncorruption, insider trading, which ensures\nprotection of the company from illegal or\nunethical behavior of its employees and\ncontractors. Qualitative assessment of entire\ncode document (where available) to assess\nwhich groups of issues were most prominent\nwithin the code. For instance UN Global\nCompact is a triple bottom line code because\nincludes social, environmental and economic\ncommitments, whereas ETI Base Code\nfocuses solely on working conditions with no\ncommitments to environmental protection or\ncommunity involvement etc. Therefore the\nGlobal Compact was recorded with \"triple\nbottom line\" and the Base Code with \"working\nconditions\" for this criterion.\nReasons for\nAdoption\nAny statement\non why\ncorporation\nchooses to use\ncode\/CSR\nsignaller as\ndistinct from\nreasons for\nengaging in CSR\nComments recorded verbatim to understand\n(where available) why corporations are using\nthese tools.\nRESEARCH FINDINGS\nArticulated Motivations for Code Adoption\nTable 2 presents the ten most commonly articulated motivations for corporations adopting\ncodes present on their websites. In 22 per cent (85) of cases where a code was present on a\ncorporation's website, no reason was given. Where reasons were given, the ten remaining items\naccount for 60 per cent (232) of total responses. Therefore, the ten reasons found in Table 2\nand the cases where no reason was given total 81 per cent (317) and thus a significant\nproportion of all responses.\nTable 2\nMost Commonly Listed Reasons for Code Adoption\nReasons for Code Adoption\nTotal\nVoluntary Mandatory % Total\nNo Reason 85 0 21.8\nRequirement1 1062 27.2\nGuide for Behavior 43 0 11.0\nProtect and Enhance Reputation 18 0 4.6\nConsistent Framework Across Global Network 17 0 4.4\nBoard and Employee Compliance 9 0 2.3\nSupplier Compliance 9 0 2.3\nCommunicate Code Content with\nStakeholders3\n9 0 2.3\nCreate and Maintain Trust and Confidence\nwith Stakeholders4\n8 0 2.1\nFormalize Expected Behaviors and\nCommitments\n7 0 1.8\nLegal Compliance5 6 0 1.5\nSubtotal Reasons Given 317 81.3\nTotal # Reasons Given 390 100\n1 Requirement refers to corporations indicating that certain codes (such as Combined Code in\nUK) are adopted because they are a requirement.\n2 Of the 106 mandatory codes, 57 were in the UK, 12 in Canada and 37 in Germany. Canada\nis much lower due to the fact that they do not have anything produced by the government or\nquasi legal body (such as the FSA in the UK) to regulate governance practices as is found in\nboth the UK and Germany. The difference in mandatory code levels between Germany and\nthe UK was an unanticipated finding and therefore must be addressed in future research.\n3 This reason is based on corporations who use the codes purely as a way of communicating\ntheir commitments to stakeholders, to let the stakeholders know what the corporation is\ndoing with regard to issues found in the code.\n4 This reason refers to the use of the code by some corporations to act as a tool to help build\nthe relationship with the targeted stakeholder group.\n5 Legal compliance refers to codes that are created to reflect the legal requirements of the\ncompany so that these considerations are adopted in all countries of operation.\nIn addition to these ten most common reasons for code adoption, 47 other reasons were given.\nThe remaining 47 reasons accounted for the remaining 19 per cent of total responses and were\nequally distributed among the different corporations and different national business systems.\nThe motivations listed in Table 2, and the other 47 motivations articulated by sample\ncorporations confirm opinions stated in the CSR and code literature, with one major exception,\nnone of the corporations listed the threat of government legislation as a motive for adopting\ncodes. Motivations based on other risks or threats were to be found on corporate websites, but\nthey were quite rare in the sample group.\nEven when codes adopted for mandatory reasons were removed (106 cases), the same ten\nmotivations represented 74 per cent (211) of those articulated. Therefore, they still represent\nthe majority of total responses.\nWhat is most striking about the motivations found in Table 2, and the remaining 47 motivations\nis that they have little to do with CSR. None of the articulated motivations indicate that codes\nare adopted to create, pursue, or further the corporation's engagement with CSR issues. In fact,\nthe motivations listed suggest codes are adopted for traditional business reasons such as\nimproving reputation (e.g. Alcan), making the global network more consistent (e.g. AMD) or\nensuring employee compliance (e.g. Sunlife). While these motivations can be argued to be a\nvital part of CSR, particularly in encouraging business participation in CSR, as the sole\nmotivation presented, they indicate codes are adopted to satisfy more traditional business\nconcerns. Therefore, the corporations themselves indicate that codes are used to further their\nbusiness agenda, which in some cases includes CSR.\nAs indicated earlier, the reasons given for adopting codes contrast with the reasons given for\nengaging in CSR. On the vast majority of websites studied, corporations made statements\nregarding the critical importance of CSR to the business. For instance, BP's Environment and\nSociety web page providing the Group Chief Executive's introduction states \"[w]e start from the\nview that the purpose of the business is to satisfy human needs, and in doing so generate\nprofits for investors \u2026 [t]his philosophy helps to shape everything we do and we regard\nresponsible behavior as an essential part of the fabric of the group \u2013 not something to be added\non as an afterthought\" (http:\/\/www.bp.com). Tesco's site describes its approach: \"Corporate\nResponsibility is integral to our entire approach to business, from Board level to checkout. This\nis clear from the way we treat people, local communities and the environment, and is embodied\nin our governance framework\" (http:\/\/www.tescocorporate.com). It would seem reasonable to\nsuggest that if codes were adopted primarily to govern CSR issues then the reasons for\nadoption would be similar to the reasons for engaging in CSR. However, the motivation data\nindicates that corporations adopt codes for more traditional business reasons than as a tool to\ngovern CSR issues. For examples of the different motives and characteristics captured, see\nAppendix A.\nCharacteristics of Codes\nCode characteristics provide richer information on the relationship between codes and CSR, and\nallow comparison with articulated motivations for adopting codes, thus either continuing or\nrefuting our conclusions of the weak link between codes and CSR. Table 3 depicts the style of\nthe code in the sample, indicating that 55 per cent of codes mentioned on corporate websites\nwere stipulative.\nTable 3\nStyle of Code\nStyle of Code\nTotal Voluntary Only\n# % Total # % Total\nStipulative 145 54.9 50 31.3\nCommitment 58 22.0 51 31.9\nPrinciple 59 22.4 57 35.6\nInformation 2 0.8 2 1.3\nTotal6 264 100 160 100\n6 305 codes were found or referenced on corporate websites in this study. We were unable to ascertain\nthe style of 41 codes in total, 2 of which were mandatory. Therefore, the total number is total codes\nminus unknown codes to allow for a better understanding of the proportions of styles found in the\nsample.\nClearly, a majority of the mandatory codes mentioned on corporate websites were written in the\nstipulative style (Table 3). The remaining voluntary codes were quite evenly distributed between\nstipulative, commitment and principle styles, indicating that when corporations chose the style\nof code used, they created stipulative codes with the same frequency as either commitment or\nprinciple style codes. Overall corporations adopt codes (whether third-party or written\ninternally) that are primarily prescriptive in content, that use negative language such as \"shall\nnot\" and that are used to direct the behavior of target audiences.\nTable 4 illustrates that staff members at all levels of the organization were the most frequent\ntarget audience. Otherwise, the codes were most often directed at a wide range of external\nstakeholders such as government, community, NGOs and the environment.\nTable 4\nMost Commonly Listed Target Audiences\nTarget Audiences\nTotal Voluntary Only\n# % Total # % Total\nBoard Members and Employees 179 55.1 85 39.0\nStakeholders 72 22.2 68 31.2\nSuppliers 27 8.3 25 11.5\nCustomer\/Client 8 2.5 4 1.8\nUnknown 17 5.2 17 7.8\nSubtotal 303 93.3 199 91.3\nTotal 325 218\nThe mandatory data suggests that these third-party codes are written to influence the way\ncorporations and their staff behave, and while voluntary codes also primarily target board\nmembers and employees (39 per cent), a higher proportion of these codes target wider\nstakeholders (31 per cent).\nTable 5 depicts the most common issues addressed by the codes, representing 90 per cent of\nthe total data. CSR issues represent 21 per cent of total and 31 per cent of voluntary data. The\nremaining codes focused either on single issues such as the environment or labor rights or on\nmore traditional business concerns such as governance or workplace issues.\nTable 5\nMost Commonly Listed Code Content Focuses\nContent Focus\nTotal Voluntary Only\n# % Total # % Total\nCorporate Governance 96 29.1 9 4.0\nCSR (social, environmental, economic and ethical) 69 20.9 68 30.5\nWorkplace Issues7 51 15.5 47 21.1\nEnvironment 19 5.8 16 7.2\nLabor Issues\/Workers Rights 9 2.7 9 4.0\nPrompt Payment (primarily of suppliers) 9 2.7 9 4.0\nEthical Conduct 8 2.4 4 1.8\nIndustry Specific Issues8 6 1.8 6 2.7\nPrivacy 5 1.5 2 0.9\nUnknown 25 7.6 24 10.8\nSubtotal 297 90.0 194 87.0\nTotal 330 223\n7 Workplace issues refer to concepts or situations that are unique to groups operating internally to the\ncorporation such as conflict of interest, sexual harassment, use of corporate resources etc.\n8 Industry specific issues refer to those issues dealt with by the particular industry of which the\ncorporation is a member such as responsible gambling, protecting youths on the Internet, airline noise\netc.\nTherefore, these data suggest that codes are designed to govern CSR issues in 21 per cent (69)\nof total and 31 per cent (68) of voluntary cases, whereas the vast majority of codes 79 per cent\n(228) of total and 69 per cent (126) of voluntary tend to govern more traditional business\nissues or single issues that either do not reflect, or do not comprise a holistic CSR approach.\nSummary of Code Characteristic Data\nThe evidence from code characteristics suggests that we must be careful in assuming codes are\nprimarily used as a tool for governing CSR issues. Style data indicate that over half (55 per\ncent) of codes were written largely to proscribe certain behaviors, primarily to define what \"shall\nnot\" be done by the targeted group. Target audience data suggests that over half (55 per cent)\nof codes were written for board members and employees, and content data suggest that the\nmajority (79 per cent) are written to govern traditional business concerns or single issues that\ndo not reflect CSR. Therefore, codes are more likely to dictate certain behaviors to staff\nmembers in the workplace than to communicate or set expectations surrounding CSR objectives\nto a broader group of stakeholders.\nNeither the reasons given for adoption, nor the code characteristics provide evidence to suggest\nthat we can assume codes are primarily a tool for governing CSR.\nCODES COMPARED TO OTHER TOOLS\nLastly, we compared codes with the CSR signallers to determine whether codes were used in a\nsimilar fashion to those tools designed specifically for CSR. This entailed a comparison of codes\nand CSR signallers on articulated motivations and on basic characteristics except target\naudience which for CSR signallers was almost always \"stakeholders\" and therefore is not a\nuseful comparison. As only 14 CSR signallers were mandatory3 with a further eight unknown,\ntotalling 22 of 303 (7 per cent of total), the comparison focuses on voluntary code and CSR\nsignaller data only.\nTable 6 compares the most common motivations for codes and CSR signallers in descending\nfrequency. In a majority of cases (62 per cent), motivations for adopting CSR signallers were\nnot articulated on corporate websites. Where given, the motivations focus on communication\nand engagement with internal and external stakeholders, which is in stark contrast to codes\nwhere the articulated motivations focus on such things as protecting the corporation from staff,\nor protecting the corporation's place in the market, through such things as compliance,\nformalizing and making behavioral expectations consistent worldwide. Therefore, CSR signallers,\nare adopted for reasons more consistent with a CSR approach, and are different from the\nmotivations listed for adopting codes. The motivations for adopting codes tend to reflect more\ntraditional business concerns, suggesting they are also more likely to be used as a tool for\ngoverning traditional business issues.\nTable 6\nMost Common Motivations for Codes and CSR Signallers Compared\nRank\nArticulated Motivations for\nCodes (Voluntary)\n% of\nTotal\nArticulated Motivations for\nCSR Signallers (Voluntary)\n% of\nTotal\n1 No Reason 29.9 No Reason 61.7\n2 Guide for Behavior 15.1 Communicate Code Content with\nStakeholders\n8.2\n3 Protect and Enhance\nReputation\n6.3 Constructive Engagement with\nStakeholders\n3.5\n4 Consistent Framework Across\nGlobal Network\n6.0 Communicate to Stakeholders\n(general)\n2.9\n5 Board and Employee\nCompliance\n3.2 Formalize and Communicate\nCommitments or Position on\nIssues\n2.5\n6 Supplier Compliance 3.2 Recognised as Leader (industry,\nCSR field, customer relationships)\n2.2\n7 Communicate Code Content\nwith Stakeholders\n3.2 To Be Transparent 1.6\n8 Create and Maintain Trust and\nConfidence with Stakeholders\n2.8 Maintain and Create Trust 1.3\n9 Formalize Expected Behaviors\nand Commitments\n2.5 Encourage Employee Engagement 1.3\n10 Legal Compliance 2.1 Satisfy Expectations 1.0\n11 To Be Accountable 1.0\nSubtotal % Reasons Given 74.3 Subtotal % Reasons Given 87.2\nThe differences between codes and CSR signallers are highlighted further by comparing style\nand content. Table 7 illustrates that in 82 per cent (224) of cases, CSR signallers were written\nin a commitment style, indicating that the language used was positive and encouraging, and\nthat content included both future commitments, often with actions taken on these\ncommitments. They also included a variety of issues associated with multiple stakeholders.\nComparison with codes demonstrates that codes were much less uniform in style than the CSR\nsignallers, and were much more likely to either dictate specific actions not to be taken\n(stipulative style) or to be more broad and vague (typical of principle style) than the CSR\nsignallers.\nTable 7\nStyle of Code and CSR Signaller Compared\nStyle of Code and CSR Signaller (Voluntary)\nCode CSR Signaller\n# % Total # % Total\nStipulative 50 31.3 4 1.5\nCommitment 51 31.9 224 81.7\nPrinciple 57 35.5 19 6.9\nInformation 2 1.3 27 9.9\nTotal9 160 100 274 100\n9 The total number here also reflects the removal of all unknown codes (39 voluntary) and signallers\n(15).\nTable 8 shows CSR issues as similarly represented in both the code and CSR signaller data, and\nalthough other issues are similar across the data sets, the relative representativeness within the\nsample varies.

Our research then focused on a cross-national\ncomparison based on a significant sample of our data discussed in this paper.4\nThe three countries of our sample represent distinctly different corporate governance\nenvironments with the UK and Canada often associated with the \"Anglo-Saxon\" market oriented\nmodel while Germany represents the network oriented model of the \"Rhenish capitalism\"\n(Albert, 1991).\nCompanies in the UK were more likely to participate in third-party codes (both mandatory and\nvoluntary) (53 per cent), stipulative-based (49 per cent), focused on communicating with\nmanagement and employees (47 per cent) around issues of corporate governance (28 per cent)\nbecause it is a requirement (27 per cent). The codes were of very low significance, found within\nan average of 3.32 portals.\nCodes found in the Canadian sample were more likely to be written by internal personnel (54\nper cent), focused on management and employee behavior (36 per cent) around workplace\nissues (37 per cent), commitments-based (42 per cent) and used to guide employee behavior\n(19 per cent), than any other combination of code traits. The codes were of medium-low\nsignificance on corporate websites, found within an average of 2.69 portals.\nGerman companies were also most likely to participate in third party codes (both mandatory\nand voluntary) (59 per cent), stipulative-based (54 per cent), focused on senior executives\/\nmanagement (44 per cent) around corporate governance issues (37 per cent), because it is a\nrequirement (32 per cent). The codes were of low significance, found within an average of 3.17\nportals.\nWhile these characteristics all help to support our conclusions about differences in the three\ncountries as relates to NBS literature (see last paragraph of this section), the characteristics\nmost relevant to this discussion are found in Table 9, which provides an overview of the\ndifferent regimes according to selected criteria discussed in the wider literature (e.g. Weimer\nand Pape, 1999; Coffee, 2001; Burke, 2002; de Andres, Azofra, and Lopez, 2005).\n9\nComparative Analysis of the Governance and Workplace in the Three Sample\nCountries\nUnited Kingdom Canada Germany\nTotal No of: Codes 81 26 41\nCSR Signallers 60 48 37\nFocus of codes (in %): Corporate Governance 28 0 37\nWorkplace 16 37 11\nMandatory codes (in %): 37 15 39\nVoluntary codes (in %): 56 81 61\nSignificance of codes: Low Medium-low Medium\nThe UK had the highest number of codes with a significant focus on corporate governance\nissues. However, the significance of codes on these company's websites was low reflecting the\nfact that the key audience of these codes (in particular for the Combined Code compliance\nstatements) were shareholders and analysts who normally have different ways of gathering\ninformation about the company. When Combined Code references were removed, wider\nstakeholder communities were targets of codes whose purpose was to communicate intention to\nengage in CSR, as often as internal stakeholders were the targets of codes whose purpose was\nto guide and control behavior. The high proportion of signallers suggests that in the UK\nsignallers are the tools more often used to communicate CSR intentions. On the other end of\nthe spectrum, Germany only features half the number of codes in the UK sample reflecting a\ngovernance system characterized by networks of ownership and non-market mechanisms of\ncorporate control. However, the codes which are used again are more often focused on\ncorporate governance than any other group of issues \u2013 reflecting recent changes in the\ncorporate governance environment of many European countries towards a stronger orientation\ntoward shareholder value (Fiss and Zajac, 2004), in many cases through requirements for\ncompliance with state created governance codes (i.e. German Corporate Governance Code).\nMost of the codes were adopted rather recently which explains the relative significance they\nhave on the websites of these companies. The Canadian sample provides us with a rather mixed\npicture. The most striking difference from the other countries, apart from the low number of\ncodes, is the low significance of corporate governance issues and the high proportion of codes\nfocused on workplace issues. It appears that codes are largely considered as insignificant for the\ngovernance of both companies and their CSR activities \u2013 somewhat consistent with the \"Anglo-\nSaxon\" model of market oriented shareholder capitalism \u2013 and largely a tool of governing\nemployee behavior internally.\nThese differences indicate the Canadian model is somewhat unique, thus providing evidence to\nsupport concern over the usefulness of the \"Anglo-Saxon\" model commonly used as a\nhomogeneous model to describe a range of countries such as Canada, the UK, the US, Australia,\nNew Zealand. This evidence suggests that Canada sits somewhere in between the two well\nknown national systems of the UK and Germany. It also indicates that the UK data is largely in\nsupport of the \"Anglo-Saxon\" NBS model (e.g. Lane, 1992; Whitley, 1998; Donnelly, Gamble,\nJackson and Parkinson, 2000), with signs that there is some convergence of the German NBS\nmodel (e.g. Ferner and Quintanilla, 1998; Ferner, Quintanilla, and Varul, 2001; Beyer and\nHassel, 2002) to the \"Anglo-Saxon\" model. It also suggests that providing formal commitments\nto sound corporate governance has been a much more salient issue in the UK and Germany (as\nwell as the rest of Europe) such that governments and\/or financial institutions have required\nformal corporate commitments to best practice. Without regulation on best practice in Canada,\ncompanies focused on the risks associated with employee and management behavior at work.\nDISCUSSION\nOn the basis of our findings, it cannot be assumed that codes are primarily used as a tool for\ngoverning CSR issues (a finding consistent across all three countries). It would in fact appear\nthat codes are more often used as tools for governing traditional business issues such as\nensuring compliance with laws and regulations, improving the corporation's reputation, and\nguiding employees in terms of expected workplace behavior. This holds true in terms of stated\nmotivations for adopting codes, and when looking at specific code characteristics. We therefore\nconclude that codes are not primarily tools for governing CSR.\nAlso, our research suggests that corporations do not distinguish between internal, employee-\nfocused codes and those which are more oriented towards external stakeholders. At the\nbeginning of this paper we mentioned the distinction between international codes and internal\nor corporate codes argued by Kolk, van Tulder and Welters (1999). We agree with their\nsuggestion that internal codes do not address the business-society relationship and we would\nfurther argue that this is also true of mandatory codes imposed by governing bodies. However\nin practice, this distinction is not well understood by the corporations adopting the codes and\nhence there is a blurring of the lines between the two types. For instance, corporations will\nregularly include one or two commitments to the environment or sustainability in a code that\nalmost exclusively deals with workplace issues such as harassment, bribery and corruption,\ninsider trading, confidentiality, use of corporate assets etc. (e.g. Royal Bank of Canada Code of\nConduct for employees). Corporations also regularly make these \"internal\" codes consistent\nacross their global network (e.g. Deutsche Bank Code of Conduct for staff) which can have\nserious implications for how certain MNCs operate within their host communities.\nCorporations adopt all types of codes, be they mandatory or voluntary, and tend to present\nthem equally on their websites. For instance, Deutsche Bank provides the text of their Code of\nEthics for Senior Financial Officers, Code of Conduct for Staff and their declarations of\nconformity to the German Corporate Governance Code on the same webpage. This is an\nimportant point because it shows that corporations present these codes equally to signal their\nengagement in CSR and thereby signify some form of business-society relationship. But, they\ndo not distinguish between the types of codes on their website, nor do they provide information\non the types of codes available and their reasons for choosing as they did. This in turn suggests\nsome form of social responsibility which is not actually reflected in the text of the code. Thus,\ncodes, whether internal or international, mandatory or voluntary are used by corporations to\nsignal their responsibility to a set of issues often assumed to deal with the business-society\ninterface. Therefore, not only are the lines blurred in practice, but also the internal codes are\nbeing used to mitigate the business-society relationship in some settings, making it even more\ncritical to understand that in practice, codes are more often used to govern traditional business\nissues and not CSR. In these cases, it is the commitments based on traditional business values\nthat are being used to mediate the business-society relationship.\nIMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS\nFirst, we argue that our study is one of the first to analyze corporate presentations of their\nmotivations for adopting codes of conduct and, thus, the \"practical reality\" of code adoption in\ncorporations. While the literature on the usefulness, necessity and potential of codes is\nburgeoning there is a conspicuous dearth of studies about the actual implementation of codes in\nmultinational corporations. As Coupland and Brown (2004) have argued in the case of Royal\nDutch\/Shell, the representation of a company on its website is a significant tool by which it\nconstructs its identity in particular in relation to CSR issues. While the companies in our sample\nwere keen on including CSR (measured by the various signallers) on their websites and\nconstruct a tangible identity around this topic, at the same time they did not include codes to\nthe same degree into this construction. Consequently, we argue that while codes may initially\nbe adopted for CSR-related reasons, they clearly lose this character and function once\nincorporated into practice. This in itself is a significant contribution as it cautions against much\nof the optimism in the literature, which considers the adoption of codes for MNCs as indicative\nof working to address their CSR deficiencies (e.g. Alexander, 1997; Forcese, 1997; Diller,\n1999).\nSecond, we argue that the organizational practices of the MNCs can be explained by Crane's\n(2000) thesis of the \"amoralization\" of ethical issues in organizations. The striking finding in our\nstudy is that even though many of the codes indicate some link (albeit quite tenuous in many\ncases) to CSR issues, the representation of these codes on the website clearly follows other\nimperatives. Analogous to Crane's (2000) argument in the context of environmental issues one\ncould explain our findings by the tendency of organizations to suppress, neutralize and\nrationalize the moral implications which many CSR issues initially signal. Codes, once adopted\nand implemented, are then hardly more than just another tool by which the organization is\nmanaged more efficiently and by which internal stakeholders \u2013 roughly two thirds of the\naddressees of codes \u2013 are committed and indeed forced (stipulative style) to comply with the\norganization's objectives.\nFinally, our study contributes to the literature on the global spread of management practices\n(e.g. Guler, Guill\u00e9n and MacPherson, 2002; Aguilera and Cuervo-Cazurra, 2004). We argue that\nCSR, and in particular codes, can be considered a recent example of management concepts and\ntools which have consistently spread globally and have lead to convergence of management\npractice. Based on Powell and DiMaggio's (1991) analysis, Guler et al. have argued that the\nspread of ISO 9000 globally in different ways is credited to three different forces of isomorphic\ninstitutional change in organizations. While (1) coercive isomorphisms are normally based on\nexternal pressures, such as legislation, (2) mimetic processes illustrate adoption and spread of\nbest practices in a field and (3) normative pressures reflect the fact that increased\nprofessionalization of management practitioners has led to a spread of increasingly uniform\npractices. Our data certainly reveal the relevance of normative pressure given that 35 per cent\n(with 6 per cent unknown) of codes were mandatory for these companies. Given that CSR has\nrelatively low importance in the codes of many companies studied, there seems reason to\nsuggest that the spread of codes is also strongly due to mimetic processes (see Table 6). In\nfact, the absence of reasons for code adoption (one third) and usage of CSR signallers (two\nthirds) could be interpreted as a strong indicator that companies just engage in these tools\nbecause it is \"the thing to do\" or best practice in their respective organizational field rather than\na result of deliberate strategic reasoning. Even though no reason given might not exclude a\nCSR-related motivation the fact that companies cannot be bothered to legitimate and justify\ntheir CSR engagement or their use of codes of conduct suggests that they take these measures\nsomewhat for granted.\nTo conclude then, our study sheds light on an important instrument of global CSR for MNCs and\nraises a number of issues for future research. To begin with, while our research suggests some\ngeneral trends in the usage and role of codes in the broader CSR context our comparative\nanalysis of the three countries under study reveals a potentially more multifaceted and complex\npicture. While the disjoint between CSR and the use of codes seems most significant in \"Anglo-\nSaxon\" countries, there were, nonetheless significant structural differences between Canada\nand the UK. Germany, however, as a country representing the European model shows\nsignificant differences but at the same time seems exposed to dynamic changes in the corporate\ngovernance environment, impacting both the relevance of CSR and the role of codes in wider\ncorporate governance issues (see also Matten and Moon, 2008). There is certainly a need for\nmore qualitative and quantitative research into the process of code implementation and a need\nto look more closely at implementation of CSR tools in the context of the alleged function of\norganizational rules and bureaucratic structures on moral and ethical imperatives within\norganizations. In the light of work, for instance, of Weber (1947) or Bauman (1993) we would\nargue that our study would suggest a more critical inquiry into the organizational processes of\ncode implementation, in particular at the level of individual organizations. Investigation is also\nneeded into whether other types of corporate governance reform, such as CSR reporting and\nchanges to director's duties are as closely linked to CSR activities as is currently assumed. And\nfinally, the apparent inconsistencies between CSR and codes of conduct as an implementation\ntool of CSR requires deeper analysis of the antecedents and contingencies of the global spread\nof this particular family of management concepts, ideas and tools.\nNOTES\n1. Each company was filtered through eight criteria to ensure that for instance Volkswagen is\ninfluenced in the main by the German national business system. A full description of the\ncompany selection process is outside the limitations of this paper.\n2. It has been suggested that Responsible Care is not a mandatory code as it is not prescribed\nby government. Over 40 chemical industry association bodies across the world such as in\nCanada, the US, UK, and Germany require their members to be compliant with Responsible\nCare to maintain their membership. As those with chemical industry knowledge are aware, the\nchemical industry association bodies are both powerful and pervasive. Companies without\nmembership have little opportunity to find work legally and suffer credibility issues due to non-\nmembership. Therefore, Responsible Care is considered to be mandatory within the industry\nand thus for this study.\n3. 12 of these 14 CSR signallers were Public Accountability statements by Canadian banks in\nfulfilment of their requirements under the Bank Act of Canada 1991.\n4. The data from all 150 companies shows little difference in proportion to that found in the\nfirst half of data. Table 9 presents numbers based on the first half of data.\nREFERENCES\nAaronson, S. and Reeves, J. (2002) The European Response to Public Demands for Global\nCorporate Responsibility.
