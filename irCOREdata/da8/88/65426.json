It reflects on a history of sanitation as a set of concepts which can both \nhistoricise seemingly \u201enew\u201f practices and shed light on the contemporary city.  It \nconsiders two moments in Bombay\u201fs \u201esanitary history\u201f \u2013 the mid-nineteenth century \nand the present day \u2013 and elucidates the distinct and changing spatial imaginaries and \nlogics of sanitation in their broad relation to urbanization and nature.  The paper \nconceptualises colonial discourses of a \u201econtaminated city\u201f and public health, and \nfinds productive sites of intersection between these discourses and contemporary \ndebates and practices in Bombay, including bourgeois environmentalism, discourses \nof the \u201eworld city\u201f, and logics of community-managed sanitation infrastructures.  It \nhighlights an important role for urban comparativism, in the context of different \nimaginaries and logics, in both cases.  By connecting infrastructure, public health \ndiscourses and modes of urban government, the paper traces a specific historical \ngeography of cyborg urbanization that is always already splintered, unequal and \ncontested.  For the urban poor in particular, much is at stake in how the sanitary city is \nconstructed as a problem, how the solutions to it are mobilized, and how improvement \nis measured.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3 \nIntroduction  \nThis paper theorises the changing role of infrastructure in the conception and \ngoverning of sanitation in colonial and postcolonial Bombay.  It focuses on sanitation \ninfrastructure as a set of materials and as a discursive object in urban government.  It \nconceptualises colonial discourses of a \u201econtaminated city\u201f and public health, and \nfinds productive sites of intersection between these discourses and contemporary \ndebates and practices in Bombay, from bourgeois environmentalism and discourses of \nthe \u201eworld city\u201f, to logics of community-managed sanitation infrastructures.  By \nfocusing on two distinct periods - both important moments in the history of Bombay\u201fs \nurban restructuring - it seeks to historicise seemingly \u201enew\u201f practices and shed light \non the contemporary city.  Following a brief discussion on how the paper contributes \nto theoretical debates on infrastructure and urban politics, the paper critically engages \ntwo reports produced by key public health officials in mid-nineteenth century \nBombay, Henry Conybeare and Andrew Leith.  Conybeare was the Superintendent of \nRepairs to the Board of Conservancy in Bombay in the 1850s\n1\n.  His 1852 report to the \nBoard, Report on the Sanitary State and Sanitary Requirements of Bombay, was an \nimportant contribution to government understanding of sanitation (Dossal, 1991).  \nAndrew Leith was the Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals when he submitted to \nthe Board his 1864 document, Report on the Sanitary State of the Island of Bombay. \n \n                                                 \n1\n The Board of Conservancy was set up in 1845 to co-ordinate the growing administration of the city.  \nIts remit involved regulating civil and material infrastructure, with the Government of Bombay \nPresidency retaining final decision-making capacities.  The Board of Conservancy laid the basis of \nmunicipal organisation in the island and was a forerunner of the Bombay Municipal Corporation, set up \nin 1873 (Dossal, 1991). \n 4 \nThese reports were influential in conceiving sanitation as a problem and public health \nas a set of solutions in government circles, and illustrate the possibilities and limits of \ncolonial sanitation provision.  Sanitary reform was championed by major local \nofficials like Conybeare and Leith, as well as other influential figures of the time such \nas Arthur Crawford and Thomas G. Hewlett (both Municipal Commissioners), who, \nas historian Mariam Dossal (1991: 125) has argued, were \u201cdeeply influenced by the \npublic health movement gaining ground in Victorian Britain\u201d (and see Kidambi, 2007; \nTindal, 1992).  Conybeare and Leith believed in the duty of municipal bodies and \ngovernments to provide healthy living environments, and identified themselves with \nBritish reformers like Edwin Chadwick and John Simon.  Both made strong \narguments for the role of drainage as central to addressing sanitation inadequacies, \nand argued for full drainage provision beyond just the European Quarter and into the \nNative Quarter of Bombay.   \n \nThey made these assertions through drawing explicitly, in the case of Conybeare, or \nimplicitly, in the case of Leith, on colonial comparison as a central means for \nunderstanding sanitation as problem and public health as solution.  Sanitation \nsolutions, such as drainage, were conceived relationally, and in this relational \nperspective a clear hierarchy is maintained between metropole and colony.  Many of \ntheir recommendations were at odds with popular practice in the city.  The \nconsequence is that comparison features as an important metric for government, and \nframes policy discourse around the possibilities of resource, expertise and institutions.  \nThis theme of comparison is also important for sanitation conditions and politics in \ncontemporary Bombay \u2013 now Mumbai - which are discussed at the end of the paper, \nalthough with essential differences in urban, political and cultural context, spatial \n 5 \nimaginaries and logics\n2\n.  In particular, I briefly consider how contemporary Mumbai\u201fs \nshift to bourgeois environmentalism (Baviskar, 2002; Green, 1990), alongside \nattempts to construct a \u201eworld city\u201f, relate to sanitary debates and practices in the mid-\nnineteenth century colonial city.  My account, then, considers specific governmental \nand public agents that at particular moments either had a role to play in, or that \nilluminate, the logics that have produced the contemporary city\u201fs sanitary geography. \n \nInfrastructure, sanitation and the city \nThe paper builds on a variety of calls for a closer examination of the role of \ninfrastructures in urban politics and justice (Coutard, 1999; Graham and Marvin, \n2001; Star, 1999).  It contributes to these debates in three ways.  First, using the \nviewpoint of Bombay, the paper casts a critical eye over some of the assumptions that \nare often made about the relations between infrastructure and urban politics.  For \nexample, it is often remarked that infrastructures, as an historically important part of \nthe \u201emodernist ideal\u201f of the uniform, integrated equally serviced city (Graham and \nMarvin, 2001), have become increasingly fragmented through processes of \ndeindustrialisation, privatization and the reallocation of state resources (cf. Bakker, \n2003; Swyngedouw, 2004).  The assumption is often that infrastructures, from water \nand sanitation to electricity and transport, have become fragmented in particular \nthrough privatization and corporatisation since the 1980s, in contrast to an earlier, \n                                                 \n2\n Bombay was renamed Mumbai in 1995 by the state government controlled by the Hindu \nfundamentalist party Shiv Sena, which currently controls the municipal corporation, an act that was \npart of a volatile debate around the identity of the city, nationalism and ethnicity (Appadurai 2000; \nHansen 2001).  When discussing the period 1995 and earlier, I will refer to \u201eBombay\u201f. \n \n 6 \nuniversal imperative (although there is, of course, recognition that infrastructures \nwere splintered prior to state centralisation through multiple providers, Swyngedouw, \nKaika, and Castro, 2002).  This narrative demonstrably applies in a number of \n(especially Western) urban contexts, but an historical perspective on Bombay reveals \nan urban fabric that has always been fragmented.  While Bombay is, of course, a \nparticular case, the historical view from many cities in the South indicates that casting \na more international lens on infrastructure demands different narratives of distribution \nand fragmentation (see Kooy and Bakker, this issue; Gandy, 2006, 2008; McFarlane, \n2008a, 2008b).   \n \nRelated to this, if there is a tendency to perceive infrastructure as an historical legacy \nof nineteenth century capitalism that subsequently became \u201ehidden\u201f beneath streets \nand walls (Gandy, 2004a), it is clear that from the viewpoint of Bombay \ninfrastructures have rarely become hidden or simply technical issues (cf. Star, 1999).  \nRather than belonging to the past, in Bombay\u201fs public and intellectual imagination \ninfrastructures have always been an important part of urban politics and everyday life, \nfrom their contested production in colonial Bombay to their indexing as central \nfeatures of modernity in the post-Independence Nerhuvian state (McFarlane, 2008c; \nPrakash, 2006; Sharan, 2006; Shaw, 1999) , to the contemporary media debates in the \ncity surrounding their failure, vulnerability, inadequacy, maintenance, control and use.   \n \nSecond, the paper relates to debates on the political ecology of urbanization.  State \ndiscourses on public health, urbanization and infrastructure cast sanitation as a \npolitical, economic, social and ecological process.  Following Swyngedouw\u201fs (2004) \n 7 \ndiscussion of water in Guayaquil, Ecuador, this approach permits a fuller \nunderstanding of the processes that shape urbanization as a set of unequal social \nrelations involving the continuous production of new socionatures (Swyngedouw, \n2004; Castree, 1995; Caprotti, 2006; Harvey, 1996; Kaika and Swyngedouw, 2000; \nSmith, 1984, 1996).  As I will argue, colonial governmental debates on sanitation in \nBombay constantly configured urbanization in relation to the environment, and \nvividly revealed urban inequality.  This casting of city and environment has changed \nand been contested through time, often constructing quite different notions of \n\u201esanitary city\u201f.  In contrasting specific moments in the colonial and contemporary city, \nthe paper shows that while social and physical processes are historically integrated \nthrough the domain of sanitation, the logic and imaginaries change significantly \nthrough time.  These two moments reveal distinct urban metabolic transformations, \nwhere \u201emetabolism\u201f refers not to anatomical or functionalist perspectives in a self-\nregulatory system, but to complex and often contested processes of change in local \ncontexts (Bakker, 2003; Gandy, 2004; Swyngedouw, 2004; 2006; Virilio, 1986; Luke, \n2003). \n \nOn a similar register, in linking social and biophysical processes, the paper connects \nwith work on \u201ecyborg urbanization\u201f (Gandy, 2005).  As Gandy (2005: 28) argues, if \ncyborg is a hybrid between machine and organism, then urban infrastructures can be \nconceptualized as a series of interconnecting life-support systems.  While \u201ecyborg\u201f \nusefully conceptually connects body, technology and space, there is a challenge, as \nGandy (2005: 33) points out, in tracing the historical and geographical specificity of \ncyborg urbanisms.  In attempting this with Bombay, I am mindful that, following \nSwyngedouw (2006: 114), \u201clittle attention has been paid so far to the urban as a flow \n 8 \nor a process of socio-ecological change\u201d, and in particular to the unevenness of these \ngeographies as they change through time.  How is the urban cyborg \u2013 in this paper \nframed through governmental (especially colonial) discourses of sanitation - \ngeographically produced?  What are the socio-environmental injustices of sanitation \nas a specific yet changing urban metabolism?  Why and how do these relations change \nover time?  What are the imaginaries and logics at work? \n \nThird, the paper underlines the importance of infrastructure in attempts to conceive \nand influence agency and subjectivity, in this case through the enrolment of \ninfrastructure in sanitary discourses.  This links to debates on urban governmentality, \nand implicates infrastructure \u2013 discursively and materially \u2013 in technologies of rule, in \nthe relations between liberty and sovereignty, freedom and protection, and in \ninfluencing the conditions of possibility of urban life (e.g. Joyce, 2002; Legg, 2007).  \nInfrastructures have historically patterned urban experience (Pickering, 1995; Otter, \n2004).  Otter (2004), for example, contends that the aim of London\u201fs nineteenth \ncentury reformers to produce a civilised, productive, clean and healthy city \nnecessarily drives the urban environment and the city\u201fs moral condition into relation \nwith one another.  London\u201fs physical and moral characteristics, with echoes of \ncontemporaneous reformers in Bombay, \u201cwere perceived as being institutionally \namenable to technical adjustment, a basic premise uniting projects as diverse as those \nof Edwin Chadwick and Ebenezer Howard\u201d (2004: 41).  In allowing circulation of air, \nwater, waste, goods, traffic, and people, infrastructures were critical to the social \nproduction of a self-governing hygienic, moral subject (Joyce, 2003).  These are \ncumbersome, slow, contested processes, involving the \u201ccajoling\u201d of \u201cmatter, minds, \nand bodies to enter into delicate new configurations\u2026However impatient reformers \n 9 \nwere, smooth and rapid progress was hardly to be expected\u201d (Otter, 2004: 43).  This \nslow, contested trajectory is rooted in the characteristic inertia of infrastructure \ntechnology (Nilsson, 2006). \n \nThis impatience is perhaps most pronounced in reference to waste, from abattoirs and \ntanneries to the disposal of human waste.  In the colonies, imaginative geographies of \ncontamination were underwritten by a close association with disgust at the colonial \nOther, the uncivilised, racialised polluting bodies that were often viewed as less \namenable to self-government than their domestic working-class counterpart (e.g., see \nAnderson, 1992; 1995; 2006, on \u201eexcremental colonialism\u201f in American public health \ndiscourses in the Philippines).  Infrastructures, then, materially and discursively, can \nplay important and historically specific roles connection across a range of domains, \nlogics, and materialities in geographically distinct ways, including the social, political, \ngovernmental, environmental, body, technical and moral.  Sanitation is a stark \nillustration of the ways in which infrastructure comes to matter in urban government, \nand reveals often fraught and contentious processes of sociomaterial engineering. \n \nThe contaminated city \nIt is, perhaps, surprising that Andrew Leith, in the beginning of his 1864 sanitation \nreport, does not begin with the conditions of sanitation, but with winds, tides, rainfall, \nannual temperature variation, reclamations from the sea, wafting air of \u201eoffensive\u201f \nsmells, and the \u201cbaleful influence of the marshy wastes on the health of Bombay\u201d \n(Leith, 1864: 6).  For Leith and other public officials in the mid-nineteenth century, \naddressing sanitation meant dealing with nature.  Reports repeatedly refer, in addition \nto Leith\u201fs concerns above, to land (e.g. its low-lying nature), soil, tides, coast (e.g. its \n 10 \npollution by sewage), air, animals, groundwater, disease, fever, bodies, and especially, \nof course, human waste.  For Bombay reformers, nature had to be integrated into \nattempts to cleanse the city and urbanise productively.  As a domain of intervention, \nsanitation brought city and nature together, and the most important way in which \nnature was manifested for public officials was in what I will refer to as the \n\u201econtaminated city\u201f.   \n \nThe contaminated city was understood centrally through the notion of miasma, a \ntheory of disease propagation popular in Britain at the time and amongst influential \nfigures like Edwin Chadwick and John Simon.  Miasma referred to the spread of \ndisease through odour, and its sources included pools of sewage, animal carcasses, \ndecaying vegetation, and poor ventilation.  Exposure to \u201eoffensive\u201f odours were \nperceived to result in sickness, from cholera and plague to a range of indeterminate \nfevers\n3.  Conybeare (1852: 17) wrote of \u201ecesspools\u201f - open drains, that emanated \nsmells into houses and over food - while Leith (1864: 36) wrote of \u201enoxious matters\u201f, \n\u201epoisonous gases\u201f and \u201eaccumulated filth\u201f, arguing that \u201efilthiness\u201f was the worst of \nBombay\u201fs \u201cmany Evils\u201d.  Streets and areas, especially off the main streets in the \nNative Town, or to the north of the city, were designated \u201eunsanitary\u201f or \u201epolluted\u201f.  \nNight-soil collectors using wooden carts and head baskets, and later iron carts from \nBritain, struggled to collect ever-increasing amounts of human waste from the streets, \nthen taken by train to Sion and Kurla north of the island city, and mixed with ash and \nvegetable matter and dumped into salt marshes (Tindall, 1992: 200).  Colonial law \n                                                 \n3\n By the 1870s, the miasmatic theory was rejected by many (but by no means all) of the sanitary \nexperts in Britain as it became increasingly clear that disease like cholera was spread through water \nrather than air (Halliday, 1999: 140-141). \n 11 \nand regulation was often at variance with the practices of local society.  Forms of \nlabour and its location, from tanneries and dyers to slaughter houses, were described \nas \u201edangerous\u201f and \u201eoffensive\u201f, as were, for instance, Hindu cremations or Parsi death \nrituals (where bodies are left to vultures).  Notions of the contaminated city reflected, \nas Sharan (2006: 4906) has put it, \u201cdifferent cultural understandings of public and \nprivate, sacred and profane, appropriate and inappropriate behaviours\u201d.   \n \nThe poor were disproportionately affected by inadequate sanitation.  For example, \nwhile among Hindus in general the death rate was 58.8 per thousand, it rose to 94 per \nthousand among lower castes (Ramasubban and Crook, 1996: 146).  In 1892, while \nthe predominantly European south Fort area had a mortality rate of 8.6 per thousand, \nthis rose to 46.2 in the relatively close locality of Kamatipura (ibid. 147).  Poorer \nareas had some of the highest mortality rates in the city, and as T.S. Weir, the \nmunicipal officer of health in the 1890s, observed, rapid residential expansion, \naccompanied by a lack of sewer connections, led to increasing mortality rates \n(Ramasubban and Crook, 1996: 147).  Urban contamination was also identified with \nmigrants to the city, who looked for work in the booming cotton mills.  In 1877, \nfamines across western India led to migration into the city, and low-income migrants \noften ended up in localities such as Khara Talao and Kumbharwada in central \nBombay, where overcrowding aided the spread of illness and disease (Masselos, \n1996).  The Sanitary Commission was of the view that migration and vagrancy acted \nas a contagion.   \n \nDisease and the threat of disease was a \u201cconstant presence\u201d (Dossal, 1991: 126; \nKidambi, 2007) in elite imaginations, and this, along with the political threat of \n 12 \novercrowded areas as a basis for politicisation and revolt, meant poor and dense areas \nwere viewed as a problem (Chakrabarty, 2002).  It followed that stamping out the \nsource of bad smells, and increasing the circulation of clean air and water, would \naddress miasma and reduce illness, disease and mortality.  Instead, practice more \noften took the form of attempts to create what Guha (1993: 389), writing about British \nbarracks, has referred to as \u201clittle islands of purity in the miasmatic landscape\u201d, \ncordons sanitaires to protect elite groups from the threat carried by the poor and poor \nplaces.  However, in contrast to contemporary Indian cities where middle classes can \nincrease protection from disease through medicine (Chaplin, 1999), segregation in \ncolonial Bombay was always vulnerable to breakdown.  There was widespread \nunderstanding that no one was safe from disease \u2013 if residential segregation mitigated \nthe spread of infection, migration, work and social patterns made it impossible for \nwealthier classes to isolate themselves.  Partly as a result, one enduring central tension \nin discourses on the contaminated city was between three concerns: protecting the \nelite in \u201eislands of purity\u201f, providing citywide sanitation, and demolishing \u201eunclean\u201f \nareas. \n \nBut it was not simply logics of fear and protection that drove sanitation concerns.  The \ncontaminated city starkly illustrated the limits of Bombay as a city.  That Calcutta \nalready had a water and drainage system underlined this sense of urgency for planners \nwho viewed Bombay as urbs prima in Indis (Crawford, 1908).  Infrastructure, \ndrainage in particular, was central to the construction of the contaminated city.  For \nConybeare, the polluted side-gutters and open drains running along the streets of the \nIndian quarter, and the \u201egigantic cesspool\u201f that was one of Bombay\u201fs main drains \u2013 \nrunning between the Indian town at Khetwadi and the sea at Love Grove, Worli, \n 13 \nwhere many complained about sewage pollution along an attractive part of the sea \nfront \u2013 meant that what drains existed posed serious health threats to local people.  \nConybeare\u201fs \u201ecesspools\u201f were in his view the product of inadequate drainage.  He \ncomplained that a lack of planning meant that many of the homes in the Native Town \nwere \u201cclustered together at random\u201d without regular spacing for ventilation and \nwithout drainage (1852: 39).  On the other hand, the only drained area of the city was \nthe Fort, where mortality rates were considerably lower.  He (1852: 40) assumed \ndrainage was the solution, and argued that the drainage of crowded areas could halve \nmortality, \u201ca saving of human life well worth any efforts that could be made by a \nGovernment or municipality\u201d.   \n \nFor Conybeare, the contaminated city demanded questions about the purpose of \ngovernment, and here he placed the protection of \u201ehuman life\u201f above a fear of the \nOther.  This is strikingly similar language to that used to describe London in the \n1840s.  For many experts and officials, it was the mass construction of drainage that \nheld the key to tackling illness and disease, leading to the construction of Joseph \nBazalgette\u201fs sewer network in the 1860s (Halliday, 1999)4.  While sewers, latrines \nand water in-flows were of critical concern to Conybeare, for him, and for Leith \nwriting over a decade later, it was in drainage that investment must be focussed and \nwhere health improvements and mortality reduction could be most readily located.  \nConybeare acknowledged, however, that he lacked data to support his case on the \n                                                 \n4\n Despite this focus on drainage, the persistence of the miasmatic theory of foul air as the cause of \ndisease clouded the links between epidemics and water, and meant that some experts failed to see the \nfull importance of drainage (including Edwin Chadwick and, for a time, John Simon) (Halliday, 1999: \n186).  This is despite mounting evidence to the contrary, provided as early as 1854 in John Snow\u201fs \nwork linking polluted water and cholera.   \n 14 \nimportance of drainage.  The argument he made rested upon remarkably little \nreference to Bombay itself.   \n \nColonial comparison \nWhere Conybeare and Leith contrasted was in how they demonstrated their argument \nfor drainage improvement.  Leith makes his argument through a wide-ranging \nengagement rooted in Bombay and its environs as its central reference point.  \nConybeare, in contrast, looked less to Bombay\u201fs geography and more to the \nmetropole.  It is ironic that Conybeare (1852: 2) does so in part because of the lack of \nknowledge about Bombay \u2013 rather than rooting his report in the city, he bemoans the \nlack of information the state has about the city and instead looks to Britain for \nsolutions:  \n \nWe are, indeed, without the first basis for sanitary statistics \u2013 a trustworthy census, an annual mortality \nreturn; our town, with half a million of inhabitants, is not divided (as for half a dozen municipal and \nsanitary purposes it ought to be) into any generally recognized districts and sub-divisions; the houses \nhave one number for police and census, and another number for house assessment.  There is, in fact, a \ngeneral want of unity and system.   \n \nOf the Native Town\u201fs neighbourhoods, he went on, the elite \u201cgenerally know as little \nas they do of the interior of Africa\u201d (ibid).  The lack of local data meant that \nConybeare relied on English sanitary statistics \u201cto show what would be the effect of \nsanitary improvements in diminishing the annual death-rate of Bombay\u201d (1852: 3).  \nWhile Dossal (1991: 128) argues that Conybeare\u201fs report provided a \u201cvivid \ndescription of the hopelessly inadequate drainage and sewage system which existed in \nBombay town in the early 1850s\u201d, the emphasis on colonial comparison means that \n 15 \nthere is for large parts of the report (142 pages in length) strikingly little about the city \nitself.   Conybeare argued that if in London a geography of drainage maps on to a \ngeography of mortality, fever and illness, so too does it apply to Bombay, and here he \nreturns to Bombay to point to differences between the elite A division (Fort, \nEsplanade, and Colaba) to the south compared to E division (Mazagon, Tarwary, \nCammatee Poora, Parell and Sewree) to the north as differences between drained and \nundrained spaces.  Sanitary statistics from English towns demonstrated that \u201ca large \nand specific amount\u201d of death is from the \u201cdeficiency of covered drains\u201d \u2013 about 20% \nof excess deaths are attributed to this alone, Conybeare (1852: 17) argues.  Long \nextracts on Manchester and Charlton are presented as speaking for themselves, as if \naddressing the problem alone.   \n \nIt is not surprising, of course, that comparisons should be drawn, given that British \nofficials were aware of the high-profile sanitation debates and engineering \nconstructions in British cities due to the traffic of people, technology and ideas \nbetween different sites in the empire (Headrick, 1981, 1988).  For officials immersed \nin discourses of inherent superiority over colonial subjects, comparison was a natural, \nroutine part of government.  More important than the fact comparisons took place, or \nquestions of whether they were conceptually robust, is what the comparative move \nindicates about the discursive power of colonial comparison in knowledge for urban \ngovernment.  Conybeare\u201fs report is littered with comparisons as often the most \nimportant basis for understanding and gauging the extent of a \u201eproblem\u201f and the \njustification of what needs done and how.  In the report at least, Conybeare does not \nquestion the logic of understanding the contaminated city through living conditions in \nurban Britain and the gathering momentum of the British sanitation movement rather \n 16 \nthan through Bombay (much less its inhabitants).  Public debates made similar moves, \nwith English media often holding civic authorities to \u201eEuropean standards\u201f \n(Hosagrahar, 2006).   \n \nBombay, of course, like the other Indian port cities of Calcutta and Madras, and like \nmany other urban forms across European empires (Chattodpadhyay, 2000; Harris, \n2008; Headrick, 1998; Hosagrahar, 2006; King, 2004; Legg, 2007, 2008; Rabinow, \n1989; Wright, 1991) was always conceived in part through comparison, as a hybrid \ncity developed through European discourses of planning and improvement.  On \ncolonial Lagos, for example, Gandy (2006: 375) writes of how British colonial \nadministrators \u201csought to transform the port into the \u201eLiverpool of West Africa\u201f\u201d.  \nPerera (2005, 2008) narrates how in colonial Colombo, modified British town \nplanning discourse, mediated through a variety of agents, including influential \nindividuals like Patrick Geddes and legislation like the 1915 Housing Ordinance, laid \na particular view of the capitalist city over the colonial city.  As he argues, British \nexperts \u201esaw what they knew\u201f, problems familiar to British industrial cities, and \nproposed plans that were effectively futures for urban Britain.  Similarly, Bombay \nwas often grasped in the shadows of British planning discourses.   \n \nThese attempts to grapple with colonial mixture have witnessed important discussions \non the nature of power and change as different ideas, materials and people interact \n(Harris, 2008; Young, 2001).  Daniel Headrick (1981, 1988) has shown how colonial \nnetworks left a legacy of technological imperialism marked by particular notions of \nmachinery and innovation.  For Headrick, the construction of large urban water and \nsanitation infrastructures was conceived though comparison between cities, and often \n 17 \nreinforced social prejudices (frequently through segregation) and economic disparities \nwithin cities.  These cities, of course, varied a great deal, but many had much in \ncommon, and the comparative frame led to often similar discourses of \u201eproblems\u201f and \n\u201esolutions\u201f across cities.  For instance, the perceived challenge for colonial officials in \nCalcutta was similar to that in Bombay: \u201cgetting rid of water and waterborne \npollution\u201d, making drainage a key problem (Headrick, 1988: 153).  Like Bombay, \nCalcutta is low-lying (10 meters above sea level, 3 metres in Bombay) and had large \nmarshland areas.  With echoes of Bombay, officials in Calcutta drew on the British \n\u201cgospel of progress through machinery\u201d, and believed that \u201cIndian cities resembled \nsome English ones earlier in the century\u201d and therefore required large drainage \ninfrastructures (ibid).  The mode of colonial comparison deployed by Conybeare, one \nthat understands, measures and seeks to make a place reconcilable with a British \nmodel, underlines the legitimacy of the imperial interest while marginalising the \nviews and practices of the city\u201fs inhabitants (as opposed to forms of hybridity that \nmay challenge colonial power, Morton, 2000).   \n \nConybeare and Leith\u201fs contaminated city connected the political, social, cultural and \necological.  Sanitation as a discursive domain and set of infrastructures constructed \nthe city as a vulnerable and dysfunctional cyborg city, unable to cope with the \ngrowing mass of \u201eunhealthy\u201f bodies, unhygienic practices and accumulated, noxious \nspaces.  As with many other colonial contexts, \u201epublic health\u201f was the solution to \nBombay\u201fs unsanitary geography of \u201enoxious matters\u201f and \u201ewafting miasma\u201f.  In the \nnext section, I will consider the scope, limits and implications of the notion of \u201epublic \nhealth\u201f as a sanitation solution, and will contextualise the role of infrastructure within \nthose responses.   \n 18 \n \nCalibrating improvement: infrastructure and public health \nThe public health movement entailed a fundamentally different relation between city, \nbodies and nature, and ranged from environmental sanitation, especially drainage, \nsewers and water supplies, to personal hygiene, norms of behaviour, and regulations \nof public space.  Often, public health entailed an effort to create a functionalist urban \nmetabolism with steady in-flows and out-flows.  The notion of public health in \nBombay was wide-ranging, encompassing a focus on the role of infrastructures like \ndrainage, to housing, commercial regulation and public education, and echoed the \nBritish public health movement institutionalised in the Public Health Acts of 1848 and \n1866, and the first Public Health Commission in 1869.  Comparison proved crucial \nfor understanding and intervening in public health.  In this section, I will raise five \nfeatures of Conybeare and Leith\u201fs public health in Bombay that further illuminate the \nkey imaginaries and logics of the sanitary problem as they perceived it. \n \nFirst, the contaminated city as a problem, and public health as a solution, was not just \nthe domain of government, but was productive of government.  Officials sought to \nlearn about the city through data collection techniques like the census or mortuary \nreturns.  This was a period of urban restructuring \u2013 and sanitation, especially \ninfrastructure, was important for the imaginative and practical transformation of \nBombay form a port to a knowable, functioning city.  Second, while the public health \nargument won out \u201cextraordinarily quickly\u201d in the UK, reflected in a new public \nhealth ideology, legislation, reports, the activities of municipalities, and large \nengineering programmes (Joyce, 2003: 67), Conybeare and Leith were frustrated by \nthe lack of progress in Bombay.  Conybeare complained (1852: 21):  \n 19 \n \n[T]he importance of sanitary improvements is not as yet duly recognized in Bombay\u2026the general \nimpression seems to be, that a defective police is a greater municipal evil than a defective sanitary \ncondition\u2026The apathy that prevails regarding the amount of life lost through defective sanitary \narrangements is extraordinary.   \n \nConybeare\u201fs complaints about the lack of attention given to sanitation points to an \nimportant tension of British rule in the mid-nineteenth century: economic and military \nconcerns (particularly after the 1857 rebellion) often took financial and administrative \nprecedence over welfare concerns, tensions that often resulted in disagreement within \nthe local administration in Bombay and which were productive of the particular \ncharacter of displaced and limited liberalism in Bombay\n5\n.  If the economic was not a \nkey concern in colonial imaginative geographies of the city as contaminated, it was \ncrucial for how public health was negotiated as a response. \n \nConybeare compared Bombay with British cities in order to calibrate the progress \nmade in those respective sites with sanitation.  In Britain, he argued, the sanitation \nmovement had progressed through three domains: first, in legislation; second, through \nthe establishment of local government in municipal establishments in most large \ntowns; and third, in the reduction of costs of drainage through the development of \nsanitary engineering in the work of Parliamentary Commissions.  These \nrecommendations, similar to those made by Leith, were often made (if not practiced) \nin other colonial cities (Headrick, 1988: 145-170).  Conybeare compared each of these \ndomains in Britain with the situation in Bombay, and complained that Bombay did not \n                                                 \n5\n Joyce (2003: 249); see Gandy (2006) on the abandonment of public health in favour of segregation in \ncolonial Lagos, and Swanson (1977) on the \u201esanitation syndrome\u201f and urban apartheid in early C20th \nSouth Africa. \n 20 \nmeet the \u201estandard\u201f.  For example, he argued that the enforcement of local building \nacts in England was more stringent, creating \u201ca greater regularity of streets and \nbuildings in English towns\u201d (1852: 8).   \n \nHe examined the \u201capplicability\u201d of British improvements to India and Bombay \nspecifically, using as standards \u201cthe improved system of municipal establishments, \nsanitary enactments, and sanitary engineering, now generally adopted in large English \ntowns\u201d, including Plymouth, Liverpool and London, and found Bombay wanting in \neach area (1852: 10).  He complained that Bombay had only one-fifth of the average \nproportion of sewerage to population of England.  He went on (1852: 26): \u201cIn \nBombay, on the other hand, the sewers are not water-tight, and are all laid close to the \nsurface, in soil which, owing to the dryness of the climate, sucks up every drop of \nmoisture within reach of it\u201d, all of which is compounded by an absence of house-\ndrainage.  Improved house-drainage would, he asserted, allow waste water to be \nadded to the sewers, increasing flow, instead of water being lost to dry up in soils.  \nLeith made a similar argument, suggesting that there was a need for institutional \nreorganisation \u2013 so that, for example, a new municipal inspectorate be set up to \npromote and enforce \u201ecleanliness\u201f \u2013 and higher spending. \n \nProtest and resistance at times played important roles in derailing or slowing British \nsanitation provision.  While not a focus of this paper, the relations between caste, \nsanitation, and British colonial policy are important for how the British-driven \nsanitation practices took shape in colonial India.  Lower caste groups, dalits, have \nbeen traditionally assigned tasks deemed \u201epolluting\u201f by other caste communities, such \nas sweeping, disposing of dead animals, leatherwork, and manual scavenging \u2013 the \n 21 \nremoval of human waste from dry latrines using brooms, tin plates, and baskets \ncarried on the head (Black and Talbot, 2005).  Some higher caste groups protested \nBritish sanitation policies on the grounds that the caste system provided a traditional \nmode of sanitation, and resented intervention (this resistance included, at times, \nsweepers themselves, although the relations between sweepers and British officials \nwas often ambivalent, see Hosagrahar, 2006, on Delhi).  Resistance also occurred in \nrelation to the costs of infrastructures.  Both landlords and private reclamation \ncompanies protested drainage schemes that might mean greater taxes or adversely \naffect their holdings and local land prices.  Drainage schemes were highly politicised \ndebates in Bombay\u201fs English media, and in 1871 tensions around taxation culminated \nin the Ratepayers Agitation, which led to the resignation of the Municipal \nCommissioner, Arthur Crawford.   \n \nThird, public health was driven in large part by logics of protection, both medical and \npolitical, as well as ensuring security (through avoiding resentment) and the health of \nthe elite.  As Chakrabarty (2002: 76) has argued, a major aim of public health \nmeasures throughout colonial India \u201cwas to control the spread of epidemics from fairs, \nbazaars, and pilgrimage centres\u201d.  These fears, argues Chakrabarty, were both medical \nand political.  Medically, following Arnold (1986) and Oldenberg (1989), places \nwhere Indians grouped in high numbers were perceived as sites of potential \ncontamination, threats to European health.    These threats were not simply understood \nas local, in at least two senses.  First, the development of the public health debate in \nBritain and India was influenced by the identification of cholera as endemic to India, \nand the realisation that it was transported through shipping lanes to Europe.  Each \noutbreak of cholera in Britain and India led to new research and public health policies, \n 22 \nand while there was often a delay in the spread of ideas between Britain and India, \nthere was a keen interest among many reformers in India on public health debates and \npractices in Europe (Headrick, 1988).  Second, a particular cultural conception of \nhealth was at stake here, overlain over \u201etraditional\u201f notions that it was often in tension \nwith, such as ayurvedic health systems emphasising herbal treatment and correcting \nbodily imbalances (Hosagrahar, 2006).  Politically, the bizarre was seen \u201cas a den of \nlies and rumours, bazaar gup, through which the ignorant, superstitious, and credulous \nIndian masses communicated their dark feelings about the doings of an alien sarkar \n(government)\u201d (Chakrabarty, 2002: 76).   \n \nFourth, and to a lesser extent, some of the impetus for public health efforts emerged \nfrom the sense that the contaminated city posed a threat to productivity - Conybeare \n(1852: 23) wrote that public health was not just about preventing loss of life, but \nensuring \u201cproductive labour\u201d in the mills and in other industries.  The biopolitics of \nsanitation was not just about fear over illness, disease, polluting bodies or social \nunrest, but about facilitating the production of Bombay as a capitalist city.  And fifth, \ndirect links between \u201efilth\u201f and \u201eimmorality\u201f were an impetus to public health.  \nDrawing on police evidence from the UK, Conybeare (1952: 22) argued that \u201csanitary \nreform is in itself a police improvement; and that crime, dirt, and a high-rate of \nmortality, are generally found to be co-extensive\u201d.  Here, Conybeare highlights parts \nof Whitechapel or Glasgow, where disease and crime inhabit similar spaces.   \n \nThis striking association of sanitation and police is no accident.  Indeed, one \ndistinction between the conception of sanitation solutions in the metropole and the \nform of excremental colonialism in cities like Bombay is the difference \u2013 in extent if \n 23 \nnot in nature \u2013 in the expectation of the ability of \u201enatives\u201f to self-govern.  Conybeare \nand other colonial officials believed that \u201enatives\u201f had to have sanitation enforced \nupon them, and doubted that they would follow norms of public health voluntarily.  \nHis view on morality and sanitation resonates with the impetus of a great deal of \nreform across not just the British but other European empires (see Wright, 1991, on \nthe discursive linking of sanitation and over-crowding with morality and aesthetic \nsqualor in Paris and the French colonies).  But while in the UK there was a certain \ndegree of faith that people would adopt more sanitary behaviour as public \nconsciousness grew \u2013 including ensuring clean and dirty waters were kept separate, \nfollowing regulations on the provision of latrines in new developments, and not \ndefecating in public \u2013 in Bombay, Conybeare and Leith, among others, had no such \nfaith in what Leith referred to as a population \u201cslow to believe\u201d (1864: 25).  If \nConybeare sought a reduction in police spending in favour of public health, he \nnonetheless wanted sanitation improvements to be policed through municipal \nenforcement.  This police approach to sanitation was popular amongst the colonial \nelite.  Flagship English media such as the Times of India (Bombay) was of the opinion \nthat sanitation had to be conducted through direct intervention by the local \ngovernment, claiming that local people were unable to meet standards acceptable to \nthe ruling classes on their own: \u201c\u2026if there is one direction in which we must pursue \nthe policy of festina lente it is in enforcing sanitary measures on a populace who can \nneither understand nor tolerate them\u201d (Times of India, 1913: 6).  Sanitary \nimprovements often involved demolition of unsanitary areas \u2013 particularly \u201cbadly \novercrowded\u201d areas \u2013 followed by the construction of new houses in their place, \nsupposedly \u201cin line with strict sanitary requirements\u201d (Times of India, 1913: 6).   \n \n 24 \nAs Chakrabarty (2002: 66) argues, in bringing together concerns with order, police, \ncivic consciousness and a particular kind of aesthetic, debates about public health and \nhygiene are important to the broader project of modernity.  Conybeare recommended \nthat the \u201clabyrinth of crooked narrow alleys in the Indian quarter be cleared and \nstraight streets run through it, which would facilitate the laying of drains and faster \nflow of traffic, and improve ventilation\u201d (Dossal, 1991: 130-131).  In this view, public \nhealth involves an enrolment of nature, the social and infrastructure, with \ninfrastructure playing a crucial role in a broader context of conceiving and measuring \nimprovement.  As Sharan (2006: 4906) has suggested in reference to colonial Delhi: \n\u201cInfrastructure in the colonial city, it may be suggested, operated most powerfully in \nthe symbolic realm, gesturing to an imminent modernity, even as that modernity was \nendlessly deferred\u201d.  If modernity was deferred, modernist categories of public and \nprivate were also subverted by the ways in which Indians used open space, from \nwashing to changing, to sleeping, and urinating and defecating in the open.  This \ntested the patience of reformers who sought to cajole new subjectivities through \nsociomatieral networks.  Leith (1864: 15) complained of \u201eindecent\u201f habits in public \nspace that the government found difficult to end: \u201cThere is scarcely a part of the Fort \nor Native Town in which the ground along every dead wall is not wet or in pools from \nits being resorted to as an urinary\u2026regardless of decency, and this custom is \nunchecked\u201d.   \n \nThis was despite boards bearing the threat of penalties, \u201c\u2026as if in contempt of these \nmere declarations of what the law is, nuisances of the most odious kind are daily or \nnightly committed under them\u201d (Leith, 1864: 16).  Leith and others complained that \nthere were too few sanitary inspectors to enforce fines (see Hosagrahar, 2006, on \n 25 \nDelhi).  These spaces of indecency were opposed to the perceived order of the \nEuropean quarter, especially in the areas of the Fort, Colaba and Malabar Hill, \ncontaining large, gothic buildings, wide streets and open parks (London, 2002).  As \nChakrabatry (2002: 68) argues, such discursively opposed spaces reflect the perennial \ngap between modernist desire and popular practice. \n \nSanitation, then, as a discursive domain and set of infrastructures constructed the city \nas a vulnerable and dysfunctional cyborg city, unable to cope with the growing mass \nof \u201eunhealthy\u201f bodies, unhygienic practices and accumulated, noxious spaces.  It was \nan unknown and dangerous city that could best be acted upon through a comparative \nframing.  Conybeare and Leith\u201fs judgements of what was needed depended, explicitly \nor implicitly, on a particular British model of sanitation.  The view that British models \nshould be developed was echoed across the Bombay municipality over time; as Gandy \n(2008) points out, water engineers like Hector Tulloch argued in the early 1870s that \nif the technical issues, borrowing capacity and powers of the municipality could be \nresolved, then an integrated hydrological system such as London\u201fs or Paris\u201f could be \ndeveloped.  The colonial mode of measuring improvement through comparison meant \nthat there was little attempt to develop workable practices more in line with popular \nactivities (Headrick, 1988).  \n \nThe spatial imaginaries and logics of the contaminated city are summarised in Table \n1.  I want to make three summary points based on this table.  First, the spatial \nimaginaries were relational \u2013 local geographies of drained spaces and undrained \nspaces, noxious miasmatic environs and clean, safe spaces, were understood in \nsignificant part through the lens of the British sanitation movement.  Comparison was \n 26 \na natural move for colonial officials implicitly convinced of the superiority of British \nexpertise and practice, and Conybeare and Leith vividly reveal the significance of \ncomparison on knowledge for urban government. Second, as a temporal logic, \nsanitation became important in the perceived transformation of Bombay from a port to \na city proper that not only integrated nature but regulated behaviour and modern \npublic spaces.  However, reformers were impatient and frustrated at the inertia of \ninfrastructure engineering, the lack of funds, and what they saw as the slow or failing \nresponse of local people to adopt new practices of hygiene and behaviour.  Third, in \npractice these strategies and investments were ultimately elite-focussed.     \n \nTable 1: The contaminated city: spatial imaginaries and logics \nSpatial imaginaries Logics \nNoxious\/clear \n \nDrained\/undrained \n \nSafe\/unsafe \n \n\u201eIslands of purity\u201f \n \nMetropole\/colonial \n \nEuropean\/native \n \nPublic\/private \nTemporal \n\u2022 Precolonial to colonial-British \n\u2022 Unsafe to safe \n\u2022 Inertia \nForm \n\u2022 Comparativism \n\u2022 Technology, engineering \n\u2022 Segregation, demolition \n\u2022 Elite spaces \nFocus \n\u2022 Protection \n\u2022 Environment \n\u2022 Productivity  \n 27 \nnorms \n \n \n \nConybeare and Leith\u201fs commitment to drainage infrastructure was not shared \nthroughout the city.  Their wide-ranging public health proposals, from educating \npeople about personal cleanliness to widening the gap between houses and building \ndrains, were largely shelved in the face of the economic depression of the late 1860s \nthat followed the cotton boom when the American Civil War (1861-65) had cut-off \nraw cotton supplies to Britain.  With available funds being channelled into military \noperations and supplies following the mutiny in 1857 (Guha, 1993), officials sought to \nfund drainage improvements through taxation, but with little support from landlords \nand private land reclamation companies.   \n \nThere were piecemeal efforts to provide communal latrines to workers housing \naround the rapidly expanding textile industry in the 1860s and 1870s (Ramasubban \nand Crook, 1996: 144), but by 1875, the public health focus was on the less costly \nissue of public education over drainage.  As Gandy (2008) and Prashad (2001) assert, \nby the 1880s, the enthusiasm for the \u201enew science\u201f of sanitation was adapted to \ndiscourses of cultural and racial difference to account for widening disparities in \nliving conditions.  The relative abandonment of drainage to hygiene and behaviour \nleft an over-stretched infrastructure and a struggling cyborg city: Ramasubban and \nCrook (1996: 151) argue that the poor ability of the city to drain used and \ncontaminated water meant water-borne bacteria and viruses could not be substantially \nreduced.  In the latter half of the 19\nth\n century, the city\u201fs European inhabitants \nincreasingly abandoned the Fort to commerce, and moved to the less crowded, coastal \n 28 \nenvirons at Colaba and Malabar Hill (Tindall, 1992).  The functionalist city-wide \nurban metabolism that some reformers sought ultimately served the elite and \nreinforced existing patterns of inequality in the city. \n \nThe municipality was not uncritical of its own role in addressing public health.  \nIndeed, both Conybeare and Leith suggested that a lack of enforcement of law and \nregulation, inadequate spending on drainage, and institutional in-fighting slowed the \ndevelopment of pubic health as debate and practice in comparison to British cities, \nallowing the contaminated city to prosper.  Writing in 1908, the former Municipal \nCommissioner, Andrew Crawford, was scathing about the performance of the \ngovernment and municipality.  He complained in particular about flouted regulations.  \nFor instance, on sanitation in mill areas, he wrote (1908: 4, emphasis in original):  \n \n[S]anctioned and convined at by the City Fathers, a huge \u2018Cottonopolis\u2019 is filling up rapidly what \nwithin twenty years will be the heart of the Native Town.  All this in open defiance of all laws of \nsanitation, in open contravention of the Municipal Act I of 1865.   \n \nHe went on: \u201cI ask \u2013 why have the corporation acted for years in defiance of all \nSanitary Laws, breaking their own laws\u2026Who is mainly responsible for the Bubonic \nplague?  \u2018Who says rats?\u2019 \u201d (Crawford, 1908: 13, emphasis in original).  He blamed \nthe Corporation for the creating the conditions for the plague outbreak of 1897 by not \nenforcing law and regulation.  The Corporation, he argued, had allowed \u201edangerous \ntrades\u201f (including tanneries and cow-sheds), had not provided masonry to pipes, had \nnot treated soils, failed to take control of factory dwellings that did not have \nsanitation, and failed to halt plans to build on the Back Bay, building that would \n\u201cdeprive the western portion of the Native Town of access to fresh air\u201d (Crawford, \n 29 \n1908: 7).  Disease continued to drive sanitation reform in the early 20\nth\n century, \nprompting calls for a \u201csystematic improvement in the hygienic conditions of the city\u201d \n(Times of India, 1913: 6).  But with little investment in social housing, private \nlandlords benefited from renting unsanitary buildings to the urban poor, while \ninfrastructural investment was channelled towards roads transporting colonial and \nIndian elites.  The Bombay Improvement Trust \u2013 originally set-up as a response to \nplague outbreaks - was more concerned with its commercial interests than with social \nhousing with adequate sanitation, and spent substantial funds on road schemes \ndesigned to enhance the city\u201fs commercial infrastructure (Kidambi, 2001; 2007).   \n \nWhile authorities often attributed sanitation inequities to the scale of population \nincrease, in practice these inequities have been the combined product of: privileging \nexplicitly \u201eeconomic infrastructures\u201f (for example, roads, railways, dockland \nextensions, and sea reclamations for wealthy housing) and military infrastructures \nover more \u201esocial infrastructures\u201f like sanitation; a lack of consultation with the poor \non their sanitation requirements; a lack of commitment to social housing with \nadequate sanitation; a lack of enforced regulation on developers in sanitation \nprovision for new properties; and a lack of planning for or adequate responses to large \nincreases in population in terms of sewerage and drainage provision.  Where basic \nservices have been provided to the urban poor, they have often reflected fears over the \nspread of illness and disease or a need to maintain the health of the city\u201fs labour force, \nor a by-product of the expansion of the city.   \n \n 30 \nIn the last part of the paper, I shift attention to the contemporary city.  I want to \nhighlight two largely distinct sets of processes that define sanitation in the \ncontemporary city: the first, bourgeois environmentalism and its relation to the notion \nof the \u201eworld city\u201f; and second, a welfarist effort to provide basic sanitation \ninfrastructure to informal settlements known as the Slum Sanitation Programme. \nAgain, I will briefly consider the spatial imaginaries and logics at work here, and seek \nto contextualise the role of infrastructure within it. Clearly, this temporal comparative \nmove leaves out a great deal of debate on the mechanisms of continuity and \ndiscontinuity between colonial and postcolonial Bombay\/Mumbai.  In particular, and \nat a general level, while postcolonial governments shifted the governmental \nperspective from British-Native divisions to formal-informal divisions, they continued \nthe tendency to view sanitation infrastructures as integral to the production of an \nordered, clean and modern city, and faced the enormous practical challenge of \nextending a patchwork of infrastructure.  Sanitation remained enrolled in a general \ndiscourse of dirt, order, gaze and the construction of the modern city.  As Chakrabarty \n(2002) has argued, both colonialists and nationalists alike were repelled by what they \nsaw as the predominant aspects of open space in India: dirt and disorder.   \n \nThe ideologies, of course, differed.  If colonialist fears were both political and \nmedical, the nationalist project sought to instil a sense of civic consciousness, a sense \nof responsibility for one\u201fs actions on fellow citizens, whether through, for example, \nkeeping roads clean or taking care with public property.  Gandhi was a passionate \nadvocate of more hygienic methods of sanitation, suggesting on one occasion that \n\u201csanitation is more important than Independence\u201d (Black and Talbot, 2005: 98), and \ncampaigned against scavenging.  However, Five-Year Plans since Independence have \n 31 \npoured a great deal of money into water infrastructures while largely ignoring \nsanitation.  Both colonial and nationalist projects sought to make open spaces, streets, \nand bazaars \u201cbenign, regulated places, clean and healthy, incapable of producing \neither disease or disorder\u201d (Chakrabarty, 2002: 77).  Nehru stressed the need for \nimprovement not just to the physical fabric of the city but to \u201cingrained habits and \nlack of desire as well as lack of training to use better accommodation\u201d (cited in \nSharan, 2006: 4908).   \n \nHowever, nationalist discourses had to move beyond colonial baggage, and did so \nthrough replacing the trope of the \u201enative\u201f with the trope of the \u201erural\u201f, where \u201erural\u201f \n(both in terms of people and trades) was viewed as inferior to the modern urbanite, in \nneed of transformation through enforcement, removal and education (Sharan, 2006: \n4910).  This anti-rural discourse was closely related to the Nehruvian view of the city \nas an important site for the expression and negotiation of modernity, a city, in the \nwords of former President K.R. Narayanan, \u201cunfettered by the traditions of the past\u201d \n(Perera, 2004: 180).  In this impulse, a new comparative discourse became influential \nin the shape both of European and American modernist planners, including Albert \nMayer and Le Corbusier, and Indian intellectuals educated in Western architecture and \nplanning, including Charles Correa and Mulk Raj Anand.  These individuals were \nparticularly influential in Bombay - especially in plans for an ordered and geometric \nnew development, New Bombay - and Chandigarh (Anjaria and Anjaria, 2005; \nGarimella, 2005; Perera, 2004; Rohartgi, et al, 2003; Shaw, 1999).  The impetus to \ninternational comparison also resonates with the planning for the municipality in Delhi \nin 1947. Legg (2006b: 196) argues that reports on Delhi at the time drew on Western \nmodels of government and citizen.  The London County Council served as a model for \n 32 \nthe proposed two-tier authority, and the subject of the government echoed Western \nconceptions of the citizen to exercise individual rights as part of a democracy, securing \n\u201eself-government\u201f.  The encouragement of citizenship was a break from colonial \npolicy, \u201cbut not from Western discourses on governance and thus marks a continuity \nwith imperial conceptions of the self\u201d (Legg, 2006b: 196).  There is clearly a complex \nstory to be told around the changing logics and imaginaries of urban sanitation through \nhistory, but rather than consider this narrative form I will instead end the paper with a \ncontrast between the colonial and contemporary city in the hope that doing so casts \nlight on these respective urban moments (a theme explored in other urban writing, e.g \nAlsayyad and Roy, 2006; Sharan, 2006). \n \nBourgeois environmentalism and the \u2018world city\u2019 \nIf in the 1990s the middle class environmental health lobby in Bombay was \npreocuppied with air pollution (Ramasubban and Crook, 1996), recent years have also \nwitnessed increasingly fraught debates around public space that might be described, \nusing Amita Baviskar\u201fs provocative phrase, as \u201ebourgeois environmentalism\u201f (and see \nGreen, 1990).  This includes disparate efforts to remove informal settlements, street \nhawkers, and (often Muslim) immigrants from spaces across the city.  Notions of \ncleanliness, sanitation, and order often play a role in these debates.  As Baviskar \n(2002) argues in relation to Delhi, a lack of public toilets means that any open space \nwith sufficient shelter becomes a potential place to defecate.  She uses the example of \nthe public park.  While to the expanding middle-classes the park embodies \u201ca sense of \ngracious urban living, a place of trees and grass devoted to leisure and recreation\u201d, to \nothers it may be the only available space that can be used as a toilet (see Bapat and \nAgarwal, 2003).  Baviskar (2002: no pagination; Chatterjee, 2004) uses this conflict \n 33 \nto point to \u201cthe increasingly powerful presence of bourgeois environmentalism as an \nideology shaping the landscapes and lives of millions of Indians\u201d, a notion that \ncombines the political, economic, social and ecological.  Bourgeois environmentalism \ndiscriminates between \u201egood\u201f and \u201ebad\u201f natures, such as between the park and the \n\u201eunsanitary slum\u201f, and privileges commodified socionatures (on the middle classes \nand the environment, see Mawdsley, 2004, 2006). \n \nIt is clear that there is now a growing impetus to \u201ecleanse\u201f the streets of India\u201fs major \ncities, whether through violence or through regulation, and to focus infrastructure \nresource on high-end residential and industrial secessionary network enclaves that \ndisproportionately benefit the wealthy, including roads, fly-overs, air-conditioned \nmalls, and ICTs (Banerjee-Guha, 2002; Easterling, 2005, 135-160; Mazumdar, 2007; \nWeinstein, 2008).  A particular kind of contemporary comparison plays a role in this \nurban transformation, this time in the impulse to recreate so-called \u201eSlumbay\u201f as a \n\u201eglobal city\u201f, an Indian Shanghai attractive to foreign investment.   \n \nFor example, the influential and controversial 2003 report by McKinsey and \nCompany, entitled Vision Mumbai: Transforming Mumbai into a World-Class city, \nargues that Mumbai needs to transform its infrastructure and governance in order to \nbecome a world class city.  It draws on examples from New York, London, Shanghai \nand Singapore, and emphasises high-impact projects with public-private partnerships, \nlargely ignoring informal settlements and sanitation.  Vision Mumbai\u2019s comparative \nmethod is integrationist, seeking to plug Mumbai into a pre-existing framework of \nideas and corporate political agenda.  It is caught up with a variety of processes in the \ncity, including: slum demolition and renovation, most starkly evidenced in a current \n 34 \neffort to demolish Dharavi, one of Asia\u201fs largest slums, situated in the centre of \nMumbai, and construct a \u201eworld class cultural, knowledge, business and health centre \nin its place; the proliferation of securitized and high-end shopping malls, gated \ncommunities, and gentrified neighbourhoods; the growth of Special Economic Zones \n(SEZs); and even a new town \u2013 Maha Mumbai \u2013 planned and built, in a bold display \nof state abandonment to private control, by the huge infrastructure firm, Reliance \nEnergy \u2013 explicitly aimed at imitating rival global locations like Dubai's Jebel Ali, \nMalaysia's Bandar Nusajaya Industrial Park, and the SEZ phenomenon in China.  \nSimilar changes are taking place in other cities, and have been characterised by some \ncommentators as indicative of a \u201epostdevelopment state\u201f marked by graduated \nsovereignties of unequal biopolitical investment in different categories of population \n(Ong, 1999; and see Bunnell and Coe, 2005, on Malaysia; Chronopoulos, 2006, on \nBuenos Aires).  As Bunnell and Coe (2005: 845) argue in relation to zoning \ntechnologies in East and Southeast Asia, these processes are not wholly new, but have \ntheir origins in Western colonial practices and enclaves (see Sidaway, 2007). \n \nPart of this vision for Mumbai (see, for example, Bombay First, 2003) entails the \nremoval of the city\u201fs 2000 informal settlements, constituting at least six million \npeople - 54% of the population - crammed into just 8% of the land (MW-YUVA, \n2001).  To this end, an estimated 90,000 huts were torn down during the winter of \n2004-2005, leaving hundreds of thousands of people homeless and without alternative \naccommodation, and other demolitions have taken place since (generally greeted with \nsilence or approval by the media).  While the logic and nature of this impetus of urban \ncleansing may have changed through time, these processes are far from \u201enew\u201f; they \n 35 \nhave figured consistently in Bombay since its rapid expansion in the early part of the \n19\nth\n century.   \n \nTable 2 below summarises some of the spatial imaginaries and logics of bourgeois \nenvironmentalism and its relation to the \u201eworld city\u201f.  I want to make three key points \nhere that contrast the contemporary sanitary city with that of the contaminated city.  \nFirst, as with the contaminated city, the spatial imaginary at work is relational.  \nProblems, solutions and progress are constructed in relation to cities elsewhere, \nalthough an important difference is that in the contemporary city the key agents of this \ndiscourse are not foreign but domestic.  The context, imaginaries and logics of \ncomparison are very different, but what is common to both cases is the importance of \ncomparison in knowledge for urban government at distinct moments of urban \nrestructuring.  Second, the sense of inertia over infrastructure engineering or new \nsanitary behaviour that marked constructions of the contaminated city is less at issue \nhere.  The temporal logics of bourgeois environmentalism and the world city are of \nrapid change, characterised by large scale demolition, rebuilding, and global exchange \nof ideas, images, commodities and people.  Third, the focus remains on an \nexpansively conceived environment that integrates the social and natural, and on the \nelite.  While Mumbai is now a large industrial and financial city, there is a common \nfocus on demolition and the creation of clean, ordered elite enclaves in both cases, \nalbeit with specific sets of imaginaries and logics.  There is little space in either vision \nfor social welfare.  Bourgeois environmentalism effectively abandons the post-\nIndependent modernist discourse of equal, uniform cities of the 1950s and 60s \n(Chatterjee, 2004).  But welfarism has not been completely abandoned, despite the \ngrowing influence of a bourgeois environmentalist ideology. \n 36 \n \nTable 2: Bourgeois environmentalism and the \u2018world city\u2019 \nSpatial imaginaries Logics \nGlobal\/local \n \nExclusive enclaves \n \nPublic\/private norms \n \nClean\/dirty \n \nPleasant\/unpleasant \n \n \nTemporal \n- Dirt to \u201eclean\u201f, ordered spaces \nof retreat \n- Becoming global, faster, \neasier \nForm \n- Post-industrial \n- Comparativism \n- Elite \n- Demolition \nFocus \n- Environment \n \n \nFor example, the Slum Sanitation Programme (SSP) \u2013 the most ambitious urban \nsanitation intervention in Indian history \u2013 is aimed at providing toilet blocks in \ninformal settlements across Mumbai, and is supported through funding from the state \nand the World Bank (Burra et al, 2003; McFarlane, 2004, 2008a; Sharma and Bhide, \n2005.  The SSP is premised on participation from NGOs (non-governmental groups) \nand community groups.  While in the nineteenth century the wide-ranging public \nhealth discourse insisted on drainage infrastructures as central to sanitation, the focus \nof the SSP is not \u2013 controversially for many public health officials \u2013 on sewers and \n 37 \ndrainage, but on building people\u201fs capacity through partnerships that insist on \ncommunity-managed toilet block infrastructures as key to providing sanitation to the \npoor.  It has had mixed results, and its long term sustainability is in question partly \nbecause of this focus.  Moreover, while the partnership rhetoric involves a shift from \nprotecting the elite from the threat and unsightliness associated with the poor and poor \nplaces, to enabling the poor to sanitise themselves and their settlements, it takes place \nalongside processes of urban demolition and restructuring driven by logics of \nbourgeois environmentalism and the \u201eworld city\u201f, and a continued lack of investment \nin social housing.  Despite the SSP, infrastructure investment in the contemporary city \nremains focussed on elite, gated areas, resulting in a starkly unequal urban \nmetabolism. \n \nConclusion \nReflecting on the similarities and differences between these two key moments in the \ncity\u201fs sanitary history is useful for tracing the history of ostensibly new practices such \nas the tendency towards urban secessionary networks and enclaved spaces, and for \ntheorising the contemporary moment (Alsayyad and Roy, 2006).   This is not to say \nthat the contaminated city and the bourgeois world city are somehow the same, or that \nthese two moments \u2013 from the nineteenth century and the early twenty-first century \u2013 \nare the only moments that might be usefully contrasted.  These two urban milieu are \nvery different in context, imaginaries and practices, but when brought into dialogue \nthey cast interesting light on the contemporary city.  Both are key moments of urban \nrestructuring, one from a colonial port to a colonial city, and the other in politico-\ncorporate Mumbai\u201fs attempts to build a \u201eworld city\u201f.  Both rely on different modes of \nurban comparison with different objectives; both enrol particular kinds of \n 38 \ninfrastructures as a means of connecting city, nature and sanitary space; and both \nemphasise elite investment, retreat to networked enclaves, and the demolition of \n\u201eunsanitary\u201f spaces of the urban poor.  I wish to highlight six intersections in \nparticular. \n \nFirst, if today there are new materials and technologies enrolled in sanitation \nprovision, illness and disease remain a daily threat to the urban poor, and issues that \nwere central to colonial officials like Conybeare and Leith, such as drainage, \novercrowding and the disposal of human waste, remain central today.  In addition, the \nprinciple of circulation \u2013 of connected water and sanitation infrastructures \u2013 remains \nabsent for most informal settlements today as it did in the mid-nineteenth century.  If \n40% of total mortality in contemporary Mumbai\u201fs informal settlements is attributed to \ninfections and parasitic diseases arising from water contamination and poor sanitation, \nand if death rates are 50% higher than adjoining rural districts (Davis, 2006: 146-\n147), then this is in large part a product of the differentiated infrastructure provision \nthat has marked the city since the emergence of colonial governance during this \nperiod.   \n \nSecond, there is a common focus on gated enclaves and protection, although for the \ncontemporary elite the ability to protect themselves is strengthened through medicines \nnot available to colonial elites, a fact that arguably further reduces the likelihood of \ncontemporary middle class support for investing in sanitation welfare for the poor \n(Chaplin, 1999).  Third, there is a consistency of focus on enforcement and \ndemolition, from the threat of the contaminated city that propelled colonial \nadministrators to the bourgeois environmentalism that marks the contemporary city.  \n 39 \nFourth, also reminiscent of colonial governing are attempts to blame the poor \nthemselves for a lack of sanitation.  For example, in recent work conducted on the \nSlum Sanitation Programme (SSP) in the city (McFarlane, 2008a), some municipal \nofficials claimed that one of the reasons for health problems among the poor is a lack \nof \u201cdiscipline\u201d, or the wrong \u201cmentality\u201d, with the result that people won\u201ft attempt to \nmaintain toilet blocks.  These comments are reminiscent of Leith\u201fs complaints about a \npopulation \u201eslow to believe\u201f \u2013 in this respect at least, the SSP is suggestive of a \ntradition of welfarism of which Leith and Conybeare were a part. \n \nFifth, there is a common focus on environment in both the contaminated city and the \ncontemporary city.  Environment here links social and natural, but also public and \nprivate norms and behaviour, and it is at stake in imaginaries of the city as colonial-\nmodern, or as a world city.  If the environmental focus of the contaminated city was on \nclean environments through infrastructure, demolition and segregation, the focus in the \ncontemporary city is on clean environments through manicured enclaves and \ndemolition.   \n \nSixth, both contexts indicate the discursive power of comparison with other cities in \nknowledge for urban government, in the spatial and temporal imaginaries of the city, \nand in logics of urban change.  If colonial comparison underlined the legitimacy of \nthe imperial interest, contemporary \u201eworld city\u201f comparison underlines that of the \ncorporate interest and supports an ideology of bourgeois environmentalism.  Urban \ncomparison has been at different times key to the vision and nature of urban \nrestructuring, and for sanitation, infrastructure investment, and the urban poor, much \nis at stake in how those comparisons are conceived and conducted. \n 40 \n \nBy connecting infrastructure, public health discourses and urban governmentalities in \nBombay, the paper has traced a specific historical geography of a politicised cyborg \ncity that is always already splintered, unequal and contested.  The contaminated city \nand bourgeois environmentalism have different political, economic, cultural and \nenvironmental logics.  Neither entails substantial possibilities for social justice, and \nboth sets of spatial imaginaries and logics are contingent on particular constellations \nof political will, economic priorities, sociospatial differentiation (including race, \ncaste, religion, gender, etc), and materialities (including technology, engineering, \nexpertise and perceptions of environments).  In Bombay, the former was driven by \nmedical and political fear; a desire to convert a port to a functioning, knowable city \namenable to government; and a desire on the part of some officials to protect human \nlife.  It tended towards logics of segregation, demolition, regulation, flight, and partial \nupgrading of infrastructure.  Bourgeois environmentalism is driven by an elite desire \nfor manicured urban environments and for a particular notion of the global city, tends \ntowards demolition, the privileging of high-end residential and commercial sites over \nsocial welfare, and the retreat to gated enclaves.  The discursive and material domain \nof sanitation remains as fragmented, unequal and politicised as it was one and a half \ncenturies ago. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 41 \nReferences \nAlsayyad, N. and Roy, A.
