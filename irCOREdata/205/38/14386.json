The\npresent study is concerned with the respective influence of individual learner variables (i.e. partic-\nularly domain-specific prior knowledge) on the use of different design attributes. Thirty-six univer-\nsity students worked through a hierarchically structured two-part hypertext about the psychology of\nmemory under two experimental browsing conditions (reduced versus free browsing). Results show\nthat deeper-level comprehension (i.e. structural knowledge) was predicted by the interaction of\nexperimental condition and prior knowledge, but that simply retaining facts was not. Participants\nwith low prior knowledge performed better on the comprehension test if they had worked on the\nversion with reduced access. Moreover, the version with reduced access helped to reduce feelings\nof disorientation. The measure of disorientation also appeared to be closely linked with the individ-\nual\u2019s computer experience, self-concept of computer ability and subject-related interest. The main\nimplications for educational practice relate to the design of an adaptive multimedia and hypertext\nlearning system and the successful learning with it.\nIntroduction\nAlthough hypertext was \u2018not purposefully designed for education\u2019 (Whalley, 1993,\np. 7), but rather for organizing vast amounts of information in databanks, it is being\nused to an increasing degree in teaching and learning contexts. The non-linear struc-\nture of the information presented in such systems (self-contained information units,\nor nodes, connected by a dynamic network of links) is considered particularly beneficial\nto learning. This idea is grounded in the extensive contemporary research on instruc-\ntion and learning, which generally conceptualizes learning as an active, constructive\nprocess of building up and changing mental structures (for example, Jonassen, 1991).\n*Corresponding author.

M\u00f6ller\nHypertext environments allow learners to work their way through learning material\nalong paths of their own choosing (for example, Plass et al., 1998), thus allowing users\nto engage in self-directed learning activities and to adapt the learning process to their\nown needs to an extent that is not supported by classic print media or conventional\ncomputer-based systems. Hypertext has often been termed \u2018non-linear\u2019, \u2018non-\nsequential\u2019 (Nielsen, 1995) or \u2018multi-linear\u2019 (for example, Bolter, 1998) in structure\nto differentiate it from forms of text with a predetermined structure.\nVarious empirical studies have already investigated the instructional design (i.e.\nsystem features) of such interactive learning systems, and particularly their potential\nfor enhancing global knowledge construction. Where the analysis of individual condi-\ntions of knowledge construction in hypertext learning is concerned, however, there is\nstill an urgent need for considerable further research into the underlying processes\n(Dillon & Gabbard, 1998; Unz & Hesse, 1999). Conceived of as a planned (quasi-\nexperimental) research intervention into current innovation and practice, the present\nstudy examines how domain-specific prior knowledge impacts on learning outcomes\nand perceived disorientation when a two-part hypertext learning environment is\npresented under two browsing conditions (reduced versus free browsing).\nLearning with hypertext: problems and possible solutions\nThe same qualities of hypertext that are recognized as advantages for learning also\ngenerate obstacles to learning while browsing or navigating hypertext. These difficul-\nties fall into two basic categories: problems of disorientation (being lost in hyperspace)\nand cognitive overload. Both make it difficult to concentrate on the context of a text\nand thus inhibit deeper-level information processing. Feelings of disorientation result,\nin particular, when the learner is unable to construct an overview of the hypertext\nenvironment. Some of the problems that can lead to disorientation include uncer-\ntainty about which node led to the current node or how the current node is situated\nin relation to the other nodes of the hypertext, difficulty in deciding which node to go\nto next, and not being sure how to get to a node that one assumes to be contained in\nthe hypertext (cf. Conklin, 1987; Edwards & Hardman, 1989; McAleese, 1989).\nFurthermore it is also harder to establish coherence than in linear texts (Pl\u00f6tzner &\nH\u00e4rder, 2001), where phrases such as \u2018in contrast\u2019, \u2018secondly\u2019, \u2018finally\u2019, and so on,\nhelp to explain the semantic relationships between successive chunks of a text (van\nDijk & Kintsch, 1983). Browsing or navigating through hypertext makes greater\ndemands on the cognitive system than reading a linear text, and absorbs so many\nresources that\u2014given the assumed limitations of working memory\u2014learning may be\nimpeded (for example, Chandler & Sweller, 1991). After visiting a node, learners\nmust decide on one of several links. They must remember the content of previously\nvisited nodes, how to get back to these nodes, which nodes still need to be visited, and\nso forth.\nTo respond to the specific cognitive demands of learning with hypertexts, naviga-\ntional aids in the form of maps or graphical overviews of the document structure are\noften integrated into hypertext environments. The findings of empirical studies\nEffects of instructional design and learners\u2019 prior knowledge 185\ninvestigating the effects of overviews and the structural information they contain on\nlearners\u2019 ability to retain or understand material have not been unequivocal, however\n(for a brief overview, see M\u00fcller-Kalthoff & M\u00f6ller, 2005). Zellweger (1989)\nconcludes that graphical overviews are especially helpful in smaller hypertexts (for\nexperimental evidence, see Gupta & Gramopadhye, 1995). In more extensive hyper-\ntext environments, one is soon faced with the paradoxical situation that the overviews\nthemselves soon become too sprawling or complex (\u2018visual spaghetti\u2019) to give the user\na useful insight into the structure of the material (Dillon et al., 1993; Nielsen, 1995).\nIn these cases, other kinds of meaningful representations need to be found, in order\nto enable the learner to structure the text material in appropriate manner.\nIn our view, one possible solution lies in reducing the complexity of the structure of\nnodes and links and \u2018restricting\u2019 access to certain parts of the hypertext. Here, users\nare not immediately allowed to explore the entire hypertext environment; rather, their\nmovements are initially limited to certain substructures. Within these substructures,\nwhich may be \u2018released\u2019 one after the other, for instance, users are able to navigate\nfreely along paths or (hyper)trails (Horn, 1989) of their own choosing, using the\nhypertext principle. This is a crucial point. For many authors, any restriction of\nthe hypertext structure fundamentally contradicts the principle of non-linearity.\nTherefore, the \u2018challenge is to provide paths that are expressive and\/or are an inte-\ngrated adjunct to other links within a hypertext network\u2019 (Zellweger, 1989, pp. 1\u20132).\nThis is not a new debate\u2014either in hypertexts or other learning systems. Zellweger\n(1989) dealt at length with the \u2018concept of a path, or ordered traversal of some links\nin a hypertext\u2019 (p. 1) and criticized the inadequate attention given to this matter thus\nfar in theory and practice. Little has changed in this regard. Empirical studies on the\nlearning effects of these aids have been devoted primarily to the influential concept of\n\u2018guided tours\u2019 (for example, Allison & Hammond, 1989; Lemahieu, 2002). However,\nguided tours in particular have only very simple linking structures and impose limita-\ntions that lead to predetermined, linear texts\u2014free navigation along paths of one\u2019s\nown choosing is generally not possible.\nOn the influence of prior knowledge\nPrior knowledge is generally understood to be the factual (declarative) and practical\n(procedural) knowledge that a person possesses in a given domain (e.g. physics,\nmathematics, psychology) (Alexander, 1992). With increasing prior knowledge, the\nindividual is better able to establish links with the existing knowledge base and to\n\u2018file\u2019 new information accordingly. Those studies that deal with the impact of prior\nknowledge on learning with hypertext focus on the question of whether instructional\ndesign has the same effect on all learners, and whether different levels of effectiveness\ncan be predicted on the basis of prior knowledge. This question traditionally belongs\nto the domain of what is known as \u2018ATI-Research\u2019 (Aptitude Treatment Interac-\ntions) (Cronbach & Snow, 1977).\nWith regard to the instructional design of (multimedia and hypertext) learning\nmaterials, there is an abundance of evidence that the importance of suitable support\n186 T. M\u00fcller-Kalthoff and J. M\u00f6ller\nstructures increases in proportion to lower levels of prior knowledge in the learner\n(Mayer, 2001). More precisely, the research group led by Mayer has shown that well-\ndesigned teaching and learning materials are of more benefit to students with low\nprior knowledge than to those with high prior knowledge in a given domain. The use\nof elaborate and complex learning aids sometimes actually takes up further cognitive\nresources (Hei\u00df et al., 2003). Added to this, learners with lower levels of prior\nknowledge experience more navigation problems than those with a higher level of\ndomain-specific prior knowledge (McDonald & Stevenson, 1998). Consequently,\nlearners with low prior knowledge benefit from aids giving them a structured overview\nof the text, and thus facilitating the construction of a coherent text representation (for\nexample, M\u00f6ller & M\u00fcller-Kalthoff, 2000; Potelle & Rouet, 2003). Shin et al. (1994),\nin particular, found that users with little prior knowledge benefited from limited\naccess to the contents of a hypertext (given through a strict hierarchical structure) as\nopposed to free access to all content areas (provided through a network structure with\na diverse number of choices).\nThe main goal of the present study is thus to test how domain-specific prior\nknowledge affects learning outcomes and perceived disorientation when a two-part\nhypertext learning environment is presented under two browsing conditions (reduced\nversus free browsing; see following Method section for details). Learners with high\nprior knowledge already have a relatively well-elaborated mental model of the\ntopic, and structural aids can thus be assumed to be of less importance to them.\nAccordingly, the version with reduced access in the present study is expected to\nreduce perceived disorientation and to facilitate learning in students with low prior\nknowledge. The differences between the \u2018reduced\u2019 and \u2018free\u2019 browsing conditions are\nexpected to decrease as the level of prior knowledge increases. Of specific concern is\nwhether this applies equally to both surface-level learning (in the sense of simply\nretaining information) and deeper-level learning (in the sense of comprehension) (van\nDijk & Kintsch, 1983).\nMethod\nSample\nStudy participants were 36 students of psychology and education from the University\nof Bielefeld, Germany, most of them women (67%). They were aged between 20 and\n35 years (mean age = 25.03 years, standard deviation = 3.27). The majority of the\nstudents had been in the university for a longer period of time (mean length of study\n= 6.6 semesters, standard deviation = 3.47).\nMaterial\nThe hypertext used here is hierarchically structured and deals with the psychology of\nmemory (for example, M\u00f6ller & M\u00fcller-Kalthoff, 2000), covering 20 central\nconcepts in two main chapters (see Figure 1): \u2018Temporal Structure of the Memory\u2019\nand \u2018Content Structure of the Memory\u2019. The entire hypertext consists of 41 nodes,\nEffects of instructional design and learners\u2019 prior knowledge 187\nFigure 1. Hierarchical structure of the hypertext and structure of the two experimental conditions: \ntop, free browsing condition; bottom, reduced browsing condition\n188 T. M\u00fcller-Kalthoff and J. M\u00f6ller\nnine figures, and roughly 3400 words. The two chapters are approximately the same\nsize, with 19 versus 22 nodes and 1650 versus 1750 words, respectively.\nFigure 1. Hierarchical structure of the hypertext and structure of the two experimental conditions: top, free browsing condition; bottom, reduced browsing conditionThe hypertext structure takes the form of unidirectional embedded links. Addition-\nally, users can move directly to the central concepts by clicking on the respective titles\nin a graphical overview (O). Figure 2 shows an example of a typical content page from\nthe hypertext environment. Buttons for the functions \u2018backtrack\u2019 (to the nodes read\npreviously; chronological backtrack), \u2018overview\u2019 and \u2018help\u2019 (with the functions) are\npositioned at the head of each node. Each node is presented on a single screen page,\nso that no scrolling is necessary. Only one node can be displayed at a time to avoid\nthe risk of cognitive overload from viewing several windows simultaneously. Nodes\ncontaining a link to a figure also feature a \u2018figure\u2019 button at the end of the page.\nFigure 2. Example content page of the hypertext with one embedded link, showing the typical page layout and functions (black and white screenshot of the colored original)\nOverview of experimental design\nIn this study, two experimental conditions (reduced versus free browsing; see later)\nwere used, with one version of the same hypertext being prepared for each condition.\nParticipants were allocated to one of the two experimental conditions at random. In\nFigure 2. Example content page of the hypertext with one embedded link, showing the typical \npage layout and functions (black and white screenshot of the colored original)\nEffects of instructional design and learners\u2019 prior knowledge 189\naddition to the experimental factor, the learner variable prior knowledge was included\nas a predictor. Prior knowledge was treated as continuous variable in the statistical\nanalyses. Participants\u2019 scores on a test tapping factual and structural knowledge that\nwas administered after they had worked through the hypertext served as the depen-\ndent variable. The level of disorientation perceived by the participants as they worked\non the hypertext was also assessed. Additional individual factors were recorded as\ncontrol variables (computer experience, self-concept of computer-related ability,\nsubject-related interest, learning strategies). The variables used in the study are now\ndescribed in greater detail.\nExperimental factor: browsing condition\nFigure 1 illustrates the implementation of the two experimental conditions. One\ngroup of participants (n = 20) was given access to both parts of the hypertext from\nthe outset (\u2018free browsing condition\u2019; see top of Figure 1). For those in the\n\u2018reduced browsing condition\u2019 (n = 16), in contrast, access was initially restricted to\none part of the hypertext, participants being directed to the other part after one-half\nof the allocated time had elapsed. They were then able to move between the two\nparts of the hypertext by clicking on the chapter headings (O1, O2; see dashed line\nin Figure 1).\nThe sequence in which participants in the reduced browsing condition worked on\nthe two parts of the hypertext was controlled. One-half began with part 1 (n = 9),\nand the other half with part 2 (n = 7). These two groups did not differ in terms of\ntheir prior knowledge or the dependent variables (all t(14) < 1.31, not significant).\nTest of learning outcomes and measurement of prior knowledge\nTwelve multiple-choice questions were administered to assess learning outcomes\nafter the students had worked through the hypertext. One or more of the four answers\nto each multiple-choice question were classified as correct. The position of the correct\nanswer(s) was varied at random. One point was given for each correct answer chosen\nby the participant. Because some questions had more than one correct answer, the\nhighest possible score was 30. One-half of the questions tapped participants\u2019 factual\nknowledge in the domain of \u2018Learning and Memory\u2019. These questions could be\nanswered simply by retrieving facts or names, and the correct answers could be drawn\ndirectly from the text. Up to 13 points could be scored on this part of the test. These\nfactual knowledge questions were also administered at the beginning of the experi-\nment, where they served as indicators of the participants\u2019 prior knowledge. In order\nto minimize recognition effects, the order of the items was changed. The other half of\nthe questions tapped structural knowledge. To answer these questions, participants\nneeded to be able to recognize relationships between different units and\/or draw the\nappropriate conclusions. (For example, \u2018What kind of learning is involved in operant\nconditioning?\u2019 Response options: (a) implicit learning, (b) explicit learning, (c) asso-\nciative learning, (d) procedural learning.) Up to 17 points could be scored on this part\n190 T. M\u00fcller-Kalthoff and J. M\u00f6ller\nof the test. The answers could not be drawn directly from the text, but required a\ncertain understanding of the material.\nDisorientation\nPerceived disorientation was measured using 11 items with four response categories\n(from 1 = \u2018strongly disagree\u2019 to 4 = \u2018strongly agree\u2019). Some of these items were formu-\nlated following the scale from Beasley and Waugh (1995). Sample items for the\ndisorientation scale include \u2018I often felt lost in the text\u2019 and \u2018I was often unsure about\nwhere I\u2019d already been\u2019.\nControl variables\nFour further individual variables were included in this study as control variables: the\nparticipants\u2019 computer experience (five items, e.g. \u2018I have already worked with\nhypertexts\u2019), their self-concept of computer-related ability (four items, e.g. \u2018I have\ndifficulty understanding a lot of things that relate to computers\u2019), their subject-\nrelated interest (four items, e.g. \u2018I enjoy learning about the topic memory and\nlearning\u2019) and their learning strategies (five items, e.g. \u2018I tried to make connections\nbetween the content of the hypertext and the knowledge that I already had on the\ntopic\u2019). Each statement offered the subject four possible answers (from 1 = \u2018strongly\ndisagree\u2019 to 4 = \u2018strongly agree\u2019). The self-concept of computer-related ability was\nassessed as a generalized appraisal of one\u2019s own capacity to work with computers\n(following M\u00f6ller & K\u00f6ller, 2001). The operationalization of the scale of learning\nstrategies was undertaken in accordance with five items from the LIST inventory of\nstudents\u2019 learning strategies (Wild & Schiefele, 1994). The investigation focused on\nlearning activities that aim for a deeper understanding of the learning material. In\ncontrast to what is typically found in the literature, the learning strategies were not\nrecorded as a habitual measure, but rather as retrospectively reported strategies used\nduring learning (\u2018actual strategies\u2019).\nProcedure\nAfter an introduction, a questionnaire tapping prior knowledge and the control\nvariables of computer experience, self-concept and interest was administered. The\nonline part of the experiment then began with a short introduction to the basic\nprinciples of hypertext, a description of the hypertext used in the experiment and\ninformation about the experimental procedure. The participants were then given\n30 minutes to work through the hypertext. This time limit made it possible to\ncompare individual performances and to relate these to the independent variables.\nWhile working on the hypertext, the navigational behavior of the subjects was\nrecorded by the computer. Participants were instructed to study the hypertext care-\nfully, and told they would be asked questions about it. Afterwards, the test of learning\noutcomes and the disorientation and the learning strategies scale were administered.\nEffects of instructional design and learners\u2019 prior knowledge 191\nResults\nTable 1 presents the means and standard deviations of the variables under consider-\nation for the \u2018reduced browsing\u2019 and \u2018free browsing\u2019 groups. As expected, correlation\nanalyses revealed a significant relationship between the two indicators of learning\noutcomes (r(36) = 0.59, p < 0.001). Prior knowledge did not correlate with perceived\ndisorientation. Overall, however, strong positive correlations were found between\nprior knowledge and the variables factual and structural knowledge (r(36) = 0.72 and\n0.57, respectively; both p < 0.001), as had been expected. Higher levels of disorien-\ntation were only weakly associated with lower levels of factual (r(36) = \u22120.17) and\nstructural knowledge (r(36) = \u22120.21). The observed correlations did not reach the\nlevel of significance. No gender differences were discerned in this study (all t(34) <\n1.62, not significant), but there were significant differences in the prior knowledge of\nparticipants who worked on the reduced browsing version (mean = 6.75, standard\ndeviation = 1.48) and those exposed to the free browsing condition (mean = 4.40,\nstandard deviation = 1.64; t(34) = 4.46, p < 0.001).\nIn order to take these differences in prior knowledge into account in the analyses,\nregression analyses were run to examine the effects of prior knowledge on learning\noutcomes and perceived disorientation in the reduced and free browsing groups.\nTable 2 presents the unstandardized regression coefficients for predictors entered\nsimultaneously in the total equation. The experimental factor (0 = free browsing, 1 =\nreduced browsing), the learner variable (prior knowledge) and the interaction of the\ntwo variables (the product term) were entered as predictors.\nEffects on learning\nThe predictors explained a total of 55% of the variance in factual knowledge and 49%\nof the variance in structural knowledge (see Table 2 for the F values). The regression\nanalysis showed that, as had been expected, prior knowledge was a significant predic-\ntor of performance on the tests of factual and structural knowledge. For factual\nknowledge, there was no significant main effect of the browsing condition and no\nsignificant interaction effect of browsing condition and prior knowledge. The exper-\nimental factor did prove to be a significant predictor of deeper-level comprehension,\nhowever. Participants exposed to the reduced browsing version scored higher on the\nstructural knowledge test than their peers who had worked on the free browsing\nTable 1.

Most interestingly, the interaction effect here was also statistically significant\n(b = \u22120.42, p < 0.05).\nTo further analyze the interaction effect on structural knowledge, the regression\nanalyses were repeated separately for the reduced and free browsing experimental\ngroups. The regression lines are shown in Figure 3. In the reduced browsing group,\nno relationship was found between prior knowledge and the score on the structural\nknowledge test (r(16) = \u22120.10, not significant). In the free browsing group, in\ncontrast, there was a strong positive correlation between these two variables (r(20) =\n0.76, p < 0.001): higher prior knowledge scores were associated with higher structural\nknowledge scores.\nFigure 3. Structural knowledge as a function of the learner variable prior knowledge (linear regression), computed separately for the two experimental groupsThis means that participants in the condition with (initially) reduced access\nperformed equally well on the structural knowledge questions, irrespective of their\nprior knowledge. In the condition with free access from the outset, however, the score\non the structural knowledge test was very much dependent on the level of prior knowl-\nedge. The slopes of the two regression lines are consistent with the assumed interaction.\nLevel of disorientation\nThe experimental factor was a significant predictor for the level of perceived disori-\nentation, with those using the reduced browsing version experiencing less disorienta-\ntion. There was no significant main effect of prior knowledge, and no interaction effect.\nThe predictors explained a total of 13% of the variance (see Table 2 for the F value).\nNavigational behavior\nIn total, there was no significant difference in navigational behavior between the two\nexperimental groups. Both groups viewed nearly the same number of pages on average\nTable 2.

This pattern continues also when the activ-\nity on part A (35.7 versus 40.6; t(34) = \u22121.04, not significant) and part B (43.5 versus\n41.1; t(34) = 0.43, not significant) of the hypertext are examined separately. It is worth\nnoting that the subjects viewed an average of 19.6 pages (free browsing) versus 19.5\npages (reduced browsing) repeatedly (i.e. at least two times), while they did not view\n4.9 versus 5.2 of the 41 pages of hypertext even once. The average number of times\nthe overview page was viewed was slightly higher under the reduced browsing condition\n(mean = 30.9) than under the free browsing condition (mean = 24.7). However, this\ndifference does not turn out to be statistically significant (t(34) = 1.33, not significant).\nOn the influence of the control variables\nThe results reveal that there was no significant correlation between prior knowledge\nand any of the four control variables (\u22120.22 < r(36) < 0.13, not significant). In several\nstudies, subject-related interest and prior knowledge have been highly correlated (and\npartly confounded) (cf. Alexander et al., 1994); a similar correspondence did not\nFigure 3. Structural knowledge as a function of the learner variable prior knowledge (linear \nregression), computed separately for the two experimental groups\n194 T. M\u00fcller-Kalthoff and J. M\u00f6ller\nemerge clearly in this study. Likewise, no significant relation was found between the\ncontrol variables and the learning indicators. Only the self-concept of computer-\nrelated ability produced a moderately positive correlation with the level of facts\nretained (r(36) = 0.28, p = 0.094) and structural knowledge (r(36) = 0.31, p = 0.069).\nThese results suggest in general that relations between prior knowledge and learning\nachievement cannot be traced back to differences in the control variables.\nIn contrast, there were significant negative correlations between the control vari-\nables (with the exception of the variable \u2018learning strategies\u2019) and perceived disorien-\ntation: computer-related experience, r(36) = \u22120.34, p < 0.05; self-concept of\ncomputer-related ability, r(36) = \u22120.50, p < 0.01; and subject-related interest, r(36)\n= \u22120.52, p = 0.001. As was to be expected, significant correlations between the control\nvariables are also evident: interest correlated positively with experience, r(36) = 0.65,\np < 0.001; self-concept, r(36) = 0.44, p < 0.01; and learning strategies, r(36) = 0.34,\np < 0.05. Likewise, experience and self-concept (r(36) = 0.68, p < 0.001) and expe-\nrience and learning strategies (r(36) = 0.43, p < 0.01) showed a positive correlation.\nDiscussion\nOur results confirm the well-documented finding that prior knowledge about the\ntopic at hand is a powerful individual predictor of learning outcomes and should\nalways be controlled for in studies relating to learning with hypertexts. As was to be\nexpected (for example, Lawless & Kulikowich, 1998; M\u00fcller-Kalthoff & M\u00f6ller,\n2003), participants with high prior knowledge scored much better overall on both\nretaining facts and understanding content than participants with low prior knowl-\nedge. In this study, stronger relations were found for surface-level learning (knowl-\nedge of facts). It is possible that this results partly from operationalizing prior\nknowledge as factual knowledge.\nInterestingly, deeper-level comprehension (i.e. the acquisition of structural knowl-\nedge) was significantly affected by the interaction of browsing condition and prior\nknowledge in this study. Prior knowledge played a far less important role for learners\nin the reduced browsing condition than for those in the free browsing condition. The\nversion with free access from the outset posed particular problems for participants\nwith low prior knowledge, who benefited from being given a structured (initially\nreduced) view of the contents. It can be assumed that an initial isolated presentation,\nbeing less complex, requires fewer cognitive capacities from learners who thus can\nmore easily build subschemes of individual elements. In a second phase, these\nelements could then be successfully integrated (cf. Pollock et al., 2002). This result is\nin line with the previous findings on the influence of prior knowledge that were\noutlined in the introductory section (for example, Shin et al., 1994). Given the\ncritique leveled at ATI-Research in the 1980s, it seems prudent that contemporary\nresearch makes use of new designs and methods of measurement to take individual\nlearning variables into consideration (Plass, 2005).\nIn line with our expectations, the reported differences only emerged for structural\nknowledge. In other words, there was only a significant interaction of prior knowledge\nEffects of instructional design and learners\u2019 prior knowledge 195\nand browsing condition when it was not a case of simply retaining facts, but of under-\nstanding the material at a deeper level. Thus, it is important that the outcomes of\nlearning processes be assessed in terms of deeper-level processing as well as simply\nretaining facts (Kintsch, 1998). Newer studies on hypertext learning (for example,\nHofman & van Oostendorp, 1999; M\u00fcller-Kalthoff & M\u00f6ller, 2005) indicate that\nwhen inquiring into both facts and deeper connections, it seems reasonable to differ-\nentiate further between outcomes at the macro-level (key concepts) and the micro-\nlevel (details) of the text.\nIt can be assumed that the slightly lower levels of disorientation reported by partic-\nipants in the reduced browsing condition also contributed to their improved perfor-\nmance. It is worth mentioning, moreover, that the measure of disorientation is not\nrelated to the level of prior knowledge a subject brings to the situation, but much\nmore with other individual learner variables. Accordingly, it seems that a lower level\nof disorientation is closely associated with a higher level of computer experience, a\nhigher self-concept of computer-related ability and a higher interest in the subject-\nmatter at hand.\nConclusions\nThe implications of our findings for educational practice pertain primarily to the\ndesign and implementation of adaptive hypertext and multimedia systems in the\nlearning context. Generally speaking, it makes sense to ensure that structures are not\noverly complicated at introductory levels. As proposed, a useful way of limiting the\ncomplexity of a hypertext structure could be restricting access to certain substructures\n(e.g. single modules) or to information based on a certain criterion (such as general\ninformation versus specific information) and thus providing learners with a more\nstructured view of the content. Similarly, research on \u2018information-filtering\u2019 in rela-\ntion to information retrieval calls for \u2018more attention on receiving information\u2014the\nprocess of controlling and filtering information that reaches the persons who must use\nit\u2019 (Loeb & Terry, 1992, p. 28). The learner would be shown the relevant nodes and\nlinks and allowed to navigate along them at will, without having to follow predeter-\nmined paths, as is the case in \u2018guided tours\u2019. This is, in our view, a significant point.\nMany authors still believe that restrictions on the hypertext structure contradict one\nof the fundamental principles of hypertext. This often leaves room for only two alter-\nnatives: either wholly free navigation or a predetermined navigational structure, such\nas a \u2018guided tour\u2019. Our work seeks to call attention to further possibilities that can be\nfound \u2018in between\u2019 these two extremes.\nThe significance of learner variables for this question becomes particularly appar-\nent in the context of research findings that show that learners with a low level of prior\nknowledge and\/or lesser cognitive abilities profit from instructional support in learn-\ning materials (for example, Mayer, 2001). Our results confirm this. Whereas novice\nlearners need a certain amount of structural support, learners with prior knowledge\non the topic could be directed to a higher level (or given access to the whole structure)\nmore rapidly. As shown earlier, this is particularly relevant when more complex\n196 T. M\u00fcller-Kalthoff and J. M\u00f6ller\ndemands are being placed on the learners. At each stage of the learning process, learn-\ners can be given the appropriate form of support. Moreover, at successive stages, they\ncan be offered new and\/or more in-depth perspectives on material they have already\ncovered (Shapiro, 2000). Given the state of empirical research, however, firm conclu-\nsions can as yet only be drawn with respect to a few individual factors (such as prior\nknowledge and learning and study strategies). There is still need for considerable\nfurther research here.\nFuture studies should take these additional variables into account: first as control\nvariables (as this study has done), and second to test for interactions of the variables\namong themselves and with different instructional design models. The present study\nwas a controlled quasi-experimental research intervention involving a relatively\nsmall (41-node) hypertext learning environment. Questions arise regarding the\necological validity of this approach, which suggests that exploring whether these\nfindings hold true in real learning situations would be valuable, as would testing a\nlarger sample and different groups of individuals (other than students of psychology\nand education).\nIt is clear that the wealth of influencing factors makes it impossible to formulate one\nsimple and overarching solution (M\u00f6ller & M\u00fcller-Kathoff, 2000). However, a partial\nsolution can be found in attempting to strike a balance between selected design and\nlearner variables.\nReferences\nAlexander, P. A.
