In particular, the lack of female representation on corporate\nboards of directors is a global phenomenon. Women comprise less than 15 percent of\ncorporate board members in the USA, UK, Canada, Australia and many European\ncountries, but as low as .2 percent in some Asian countries. A growing body of research\nin business ethics explores gender diversity and corporate governance, focusing on\nmicro-level studies of the characteristics of female board members, their boards and\nfirms and the effects of gender diversity. Our research extends the extant person and\nsituation centred discussions to consider environmental explanations.\nGender diversity in management is said to provide a number of benefits, including new\nideas and improved communication (Milliken and Martins, 1996), insights on female\nmarket segmentation (Daily, Certo and Dalton, 1999) and transformational management\nstyle (Rosener, 1990). These competencies are particularly critical in a global world,\nwhere women also play active roles as entrepreneurs, managers and consumers\n(Economist, 2006). Adler (1997) emphasised the importance of having women as well\nas men in the global talent pool in order to identify the next generation of leaders in\nglobal society. Wise global leaders need the ability to work interactively and sensitively\nwith leaders from other cultures, and Adler highlights how some women global leaders\nuse influence and inspiration, rather than command and control to achieve their goals.\nFurthermore, female board members represent career opportunities for potential female\nemployees (Bilimoria, 2006), inspire women employees to senior management roles\n(Bilimoria and Wheeler, 2000) and often engage in networking and mentoring of\nwomen through corporate networks. These positive spillovers may extend outside the\nfirm. For example, law firms whose key clients have women on their boards are more\nlikely to promote women (Beckman and Phillips, 2005). While the importance of\nwomen to corporate boards has been long acknowledged (Burke, 1997; Bilimoria and\nWheeler, 2000), females have made only modest gains in terms of directorships on\ncorporate boards (Daily, Certo and Dalton, 1999; Arfken, Bellar and Helms, 2004).\nTo date, research on female board representation has explored individual and firm\nfactors, mostly in single country studies. An extensive body of person-centred research\nexplores individual characteristics of board appointees including education, work\nexperience (e.g. Kesner, 1988; Burgess and Tharenou, 2002; Hillman, Cannella and\nHarris, 2002) and social networks (Burke, 1997). Firm-centred research has explored\ncorporate governance practice, presence of senior women managers and barriers\n(Fryxell and Lerner, 1989; Coffey and Wang, 1998; Oakley, 2000) and the effect of\ngender diversity on firm philanthropy (Williams, 2003) and social responsiveness\n(Ibrahim and Angelidis, 1995). In addition to individual and firm level factors, there\nmay be underlying conditions in the national environment that contribute to the\nrepresentation of women on corporate boards. This paper answers calls for research\ninto board gender diversity (Daily, Certo and Dalton, 1999), building on theoretical\napproaches (Bilimoria and Wheeler, 2000) and taking into account environmental\ncontext (Johnson, Daily and Ellstrand, 1996).\nIn this research, we are interested in ascertaining what factors in the environment are\nassociated with women's representation on the boards of the top echelon of firms by\nsize and market power, including the USA's Fortune 100 and UK's FTSE100. We are\ninterested in the presence of females in decision-making capacities in the highest\n3stratum of these powerful multinational enterprises. We begin by putting forward three\ndistinct hypotheses regarding the possible role of social, political and economic\nenvironment context. The results from our forty-three country study are discussed,\nincluding implications for future research. We believe that this study is the first of its\nkind to explore the relationship between the macro-environment and the presence of\nwomen on corporate boards.\nTheoretical Background\nWe are interested in examining environmental factors that might affect the proportions\nof women on corporate boards. Studies at individual and firm levels assume that the\nlabour market is open and fully competitive, and focus on the efforts of individuals and\ntheir organisations to adapt so that more women can achieve top positions. A review of\nthe glass ceiling literature by Powell (1999) indicates that at the individual level, in the\npast women were said to lack the necessary qualities, such as ambition and confidence\nin comparison to men, as well as leadership skills such as assertiveness and influencing\nbehaviour. Women were also said to lack the relevant experience or education for\nleadership (Powell, 1999), although women now have higher academic qualifications on\naverage than men (HESA, 2003). Situation-centred explanations include women's\nfamily responsibilities that hinder or are perceived to hinder their commitment to the\norganisation and their lack of involvement in corporate networks that provide access to\npowerful people. Other barriers are based in gendered social systems, where work has\nbeen designed by men for men, and where patriarchy defines work roles by gender,\nleading to direct discrimination and stereotyping. Structures such as recruitment and\npromotion systems operate in a gender biased way, for instance in the assumption that\ncareer paths for leaders will be unbroken, thereby excluding women who take maternity\nleave or part-time work, or who relocate several times due to partners' career moves.\nFinally, interaction centred explanations for the lack of women's advancement focus on\nthe aggregated effect of interacting processes, such as women's reluctance to self-\npromote or actively manage their careers in organisations with informal promotion\nprocesses (Singh, Kumra and Vinnicombe, 2002). This can lead to managerial\nassumptions that women are happy to continue with their present position, whilst male\npeers indicate much more strongly to the promotion gatekeepers their ambition, their\ncareer successes and their readiness for the next step. In such processes, women may\nself-limit their advancement unless managers are aware of gender differences and take\nsteps, such as offering mentoring and advocacy, to address the situation. However, there\nare wider external structures and processes that also impact the enactment of women's\ncareers, but these are under-researched.\nIn contrast to the explanations above, centred on the individual and the organisation, an\nenvironmental perspective takes an open systems view, and examines the rigidities of\nthe wider structure which may produce constraints. Our primary contribution is the\ninvestigation of the role of the environment on the gender diversity of corporate boards.\nOur explanatory variables are derived from three forces in the macro-environment:\nsocial (the presence of women in senior management), political (women's historical role\nin government leadership positions) and economic (gender pay gap).\nFemale Presence in Senior Management and Legislature Roles\nThe critical role of the labour markets is often neglected in extant individual and firm\nexplanations for the representation of women on corporate board levels. Globally,\nwomen comprise the fastest growing section of the labour force, but are\ndisproportionately overrepresented in informal employment, unpaid work and\nundesirable sectors; and under-represented in management roles (ILO, 2004). A variety\n4of person-centred (e.g. socialisation process, personality traits) and situation-centred\n(e.g. nature of the work, group dynamics) explanations have been offered. For example,\npsychological processes such as homosocial reproduction were also thought to lead to\nwomen being disadvantaged by their gender during selection and promotion processes\n(Powell, 1999). Reports indicate that the proportion of female managers has improved\nover time in countries such as the USA and UK, but still lags behind men (USDOL,\n2005; WEU, 2002).\nThe under-representation of senior women managers in private and public roles is a\ncritical environmental context, as these managers constitute the population from which\nnew board members are appointed. A study of new appointees to the UK's FTSE100\nboards reported that half of the women had previous experience in financial institutions,\na third had experience of senior positions in the public sector, and nearly a quarter had\nvoluntary and charity organisations leadership experience, and many had sat on\ngovernment advisory bodies, and boards of arts and other organisations (Singh,\nVinnicombe and Terjesen, 2007 ). Research from Canada indicates that CEOs attribute\nthe low number of women on boards as due to their lack of such management\nqualifications (Burke, 1997). We expect that women who gain experience in legislative,\nmanagement and other official roles will be considered for board appointments.\nHypothesis 1: Countries with higher levels of female representation in legislature,\nsenior officials and managers are more likely to have women on their corporate boards.\nHistorical Female Presence in Executive Office\nIn this research, we wish to distinguish between women's 'pipeline' representation in\nlower bodies of the legislature (described above) and a second key element in the\nmacro-environment: the historical involvement of women in the highest political\nechelon, the executive federal office. In many countries, female parliamentarians are a\nrelatively recent phenomenon. For example, Singapore and Switzerland elected their\nfirst women into public office in 1963 and 1971 respectively. Other countries have a\nlonger history of legislative representation. For example, in Europe, the first female\nparliamentarian was elected in Finland in 1907, and in Sweden only in 1922, whilst in\nthe UK, it was in 1919 that Lady Astor took her seat at Westminster. Minority groups,\nincluding women, transition through five mobilisation processes, each with a threshold\nand period of stabilisation until the movement towards the next phase: legitimisation as\ncitizens (males and females) prior to obtaining the vote; legitimisation as women\nentitled to suffrage (an additional threshold that men did not have to pass);\nincorporation, representation and executive power (Raaum, 2005).\nHowever, women may have political representation, but not executive power, and\nunless female politicians reach a critical mass, change will come slowly, as\ndemonstrated in the male-dominated ranks of most European parliaments. Raaum\n(2005) draws on token theory to explain this process, but highlights the arguments made\nby Dahlerup (1998) that the numerical representation theory does not take account the\ncontinuing imbalance in male and female power bases within politics. For example, in\nthe Nordic countries, it was not until the 1970s that all the parliaments (except Iceland)\nachieved at least 20 percent female representation, but by 2004, Sweden was far ahead\nof the others with 45 percent. Indeed, in 1994 and still in 2005, 50 percent of Swedish\ncabinet posts were held by women. It could be held that this represents executive power,\nthe final stage of political mobilisation for Swedish women. Yet Sweden has never had\na female prime minister, in contrast to Norway (1981) and Finland (2003), nor a female\npresident, in contrast to Iceland (1980) and Finland (2000).\n5In her research on global women leaders, Adler (1997) describes the `feminisation' of\nglobal leadership, a process by which women become disproportionately represented in\ncustomarily male occupations, and which results in the \"spread of traits or qualities that\nare traditionally associated with [women]. . . to . . . people [and processes] not usually\ndescribed that way\" (Fondas, 1997:258 in Adler, 1997:184). The feminisation of\nleadership reflects a wider influence of interactive communication styles and character\ntraits which might be expected to perpetuate in corporate realms. Hence, we suspect the\nfollowing:\nHypothesis 2a: Countries with a longer history of women in political office are more\nlikely to have women on their corporate boards.\nHowever, we could also argue that in countries where political power was achieved\nearlier, there is likely to be complacency in that gender inequality is no longer a burning\nissue. This contentment may lead to stagnation of effort for female representation in\ncorporate spheres. Political activists are likely to have moved into other agendas, such\nas education and social welfare that attract more votes as they appeal to a wider range of\nthe electorate than championing the cause of a few women directors. Thus, we suspect\nthat countries with more recent female political representation may have more\nmomentum in their change agenda and put more effort into increasing women's full\nparticipation in the business arena.\nHypothesis 2b: Countries with a shorter history of women in political office are more\nlikely to have women on their corporate boards.\nThe Gender Pay Gap\nA final environmental factor concerning the lack of women on corporate boards may be\nthe degree to which men and women receive unequal financial rewards for their work.\nPay has symbolic value as a factor in career progression, and high pay represents\nindividual achievement. In the career tournament model (Rosenbaum, 1989), important\nindicators of achievement including salary, age and level are used in the decision to\npromote individuals to the next round. Where men and women have career equality and\nhence equal access to the boardroom, there should be little difference in the indicators\nfor promotability, including pay. Pay is an outcome of the employment exchange\nrelationship, and women are generally weaker partners in a business and industrial\nworld designed by males for male breadwinners. Women traditionally have not had the\npower to negotiate equal pay to men, remaining \"others\" in the work arena whose pay\nwas, until recently, often seen as pin money to supplement male wages (Acker, 1990).\nWhile the principle of equal pay for work of equal value has been endorsed by many\ncountries, there is a persistent gender pay gap. Australia's 13 percent pay gap, one of the\nlowest amongst OECD countries, is generally attributed to a highly regulated labour\nmarket, and early efforts to achieve pay equality on a comparable worth footing, given\nthe highly segregated nature of the labour market (Eastough and Miller, 2004). Indeed,\nat the base level wages, there was no gender pay gap in Australia, due to minimum\nwage regulation. Australia's situation sharply contrasts with the non-regulated USA,\nwhere women pay a larger wages penalty than do their male peers for having low labour\nmarket skills and working in poorly paid sectors (Blau and Kahn, 2003). Even in the\nEU where the 1975 Equal Pay Directive made sex discrimination illegal in all aspects of\npay, the average EU gender pay gap is 15 percent for hourly pay of full-time workers,\nand as high as 40 percent in the UK between women's part-time and men's full-time\n6hourly pay. It is lowest in countries such as Bulgaria and Slovenia (WEU, 2002; Pollert,\n2005). The EC's 2005 Employment Report suggests that some transitional economies'\nlower gender pay gap may be due, in part, to the increased need for skills predominantly\nheld by women, particularly in the services sector. It may be that pay equality indicates\nequal work and equal opportunities for advancement, including to corporate boards.\n7Hypothesis 3: Countries in which women earn a more equal share to men are more\nlikely to have women on their corporate boards.\nData and Methodology\nWe compiled secondary data from a number of sources. The dependent variable, the\npercentage of women on corporate boards, is based on surveys of gender diversity on\ncorporate boards, taken between 2003 and 2005. Our sources include the European\nCommission (2006), McKinsey (2005), Catalyst (2004), Center for Corporate Diversity\n(2004), Corporate Women Directors International (2004), Ding and Charoeweng (2004)\nand Izraeli (2001). The following three independent variables are taken from the United\nNations Development Programme Gender Empowerment Index (UNDP, 2006): (1)\nPercentage of females in the legislature, senior official and management positions; (2)\nYear that the first woman was elected to political office and (3) Ratio of earned income\nby females and males. We used logit regression to test our hypothesis.\nResults\nWe begin by examining the percentage of women on corporate boards in the forty-three\ncountries. See Figure 1.\nFigure 1: Percentage of women directors on corporate boards\nFrom Figure 1, large between-country differences are apparent, with board\nrepresentation as low as .2 percent in Japan and as high as 22 percent in Slovenia. Next,\nwe report the descriptive statistics in table 1. On average, women hold nearly 29\npercent of senior leadership positions, however this varies from 6 percent in Turkey to\n46 percent in the USA. The gender pay gap ranges from 35 percent in Austria to 90\npercent in Switzerland. Finally, the year of the first woman elected to parliament ranges\nfrom 1907 (Finland) to 1992 (Croatia, Czech Republic and Slovenia). We did not\nidentify any significant correlations among our variables, and thus do not have problems\nwith multicollinearity.\n%\nof\nW\nom\nen\nD\nir\nec\nto\nrs\non\nC\nor\npo\nra\nte\nBo\nar\nds\n8Variable Mean Standard\ndeviation\n1 2\n1 Female representation in legislature, senior\nofficials and managers\n2 Year that the first women was elected to a\nfederal political office\n3 Wage gap: female to male earned income\n28.97\n1938.6\n0.563\n7.02\n23.04\n0.116\n-0.240\n0.353 -0.267\nNote: No significant correlations among variables\nTable 1: Descriptive statistics and correlations among variables\nUsing logit regression, we report findings from our three hypothesis tests in Table 2. As\nexpected, we find that countries with a higher proportion of females in the legislature,\nsenior official and management positions are significantly more likely (p<.001) to have\nhigher representation of women on corporate boards. Hypothesis 1 is supported. Next,\nour results indicate that countries with a longer history of elected female officials are\nsignificantly less likely to have women on corporate boards. Hypothesis 2a is not\nsupported, in fact, we find just the opposite, supporting Hypothesis 2b: countries with a\nlonger history of female political representation are significantly less likely (p<.001) to\nhave women on their boards. Finally, our results indicate that countries in which\nwomen earn a more similar ratio of income to men are significantly more likely to have\nhigher numbers of women on their corporate boards (p<.001).

We\ndiscuss each finding in turn. Consistent with findings that those appointing directors\nvalue women with prior corporate board experience (Mattis, 2000) and newly appointed\nfemale directors are likely to have previous experience on boards of non-profit and\ncultural organisations, as well as corporations (Bilimoria and Piderit, 1994), we find that\ncountries with greater shares of senior women leaders will also have greater female\nrepresentation on corporate boards.\n9Second, we find evidence that the pay gap is related to board gender diversity.\nSpecifically, in countries where women and men earn similar amounts, there is a more\nequitable playing field and women are more likely to gain board positions.\nThird, our findings belie some of the myths about environments in which females\nachieve directorships of publicly-held firms. In particular, we find that higher numbers\nof female directorships are not associated with historical political elements.\nEnvironments with more recent political empowerment of women are in fact, more\nlikely to have greater numbers of female directors. This finding includes countries such\nas Croatia, Czech Republic and Slovenia which elected women in 1992, and have 12, 12\nand 22 percent female corporate board representation respectively. These former\nSoviet-block economies are fast movers, outperforming countries such as Ireland,\nDenmark and the Netherlands which elected women as early as 1918 and have\nrespectively 2, 5 and 5 percent female board representation. Another possible\nimplication is that women have been pursuing careers in politics, rather than business.\nIndeed, there is anecdotal evidence of this in countries such as Norway and Sweden\nwhere women have historically dominated the public roles in government, but have had\nlittle involvement at senior levels in private and publicly listed firms.\nAnother possible explanation is that countries in which women have had more historical\npresence in parliament have become complacent, with a subsequent stagnation of\nequality promotion efforts to remedy the unequal playing field in the competition for\nbusiness leadership positions. In addition, parliamentarians may choose to focus their\nefforts on inequalities for women in general, for example, better maternal health or\nbetter childcare support, that are likely to be sustained vote-catching policies. We see\nthis today in the UK, where ministers are focused on helping women in the workplace,\nas evidenced by the 2006 Women and Work Commission, with policies and practices to\nhelp those women and men with family responsibilities. There are limited resources,\nand whilst there is voiced female ministerial support for increasing the representation of\nwomen on corporate boards, this issue is not of such general interest to citizens, nor is it\ncontinually on the agenda, in contrast to other social issues.\nA further possibility is the presence of the \"Queen Bee syndrome,\" that older women in\npowerful positions may resent their younger colleagues and sometimes deliberately hold\nthem back. For example, some argue that the UK's former Prime Minister Margaret\nThatcher did not seek to promote other women (Smith, 2000). Furthermore, it may be\n10\nthat early women in parliament tended to come largely from privileged backgrounds, and\nwere more concerned about female suffrage rather than championing the cause for women in\nbusiness leadership. Finally, the public sector may be more influenced by political will for\nchange, whilst the private sector is resistant, even in Scandinavia. A combination of factors may\nbe important.\nWe acknowledge several limitations of our study. First, as there is no directly\ncomparable cross-country measure of the percentage of women directors on corporate boards\navailable, we gathered our data from a variety of sources. The European Commission (EU,\n2006) uses data from the top 50 companies in each country, however other countries' data is\nbased on a slightly smaller (e.g. Lithuania) or larger (e.g. US) sample of firms. Secondly, we\ndo not control for the countries' average size of boards, size of companies and industry\ndominance. Several single-country studies have shown that firms with larger market\ncapitalisation are more likely to have more directors on their boards and a higher proportion\nof female directors, however some countries set a limit to the number of directors on their\nboards.\nConclusions\nWe set out to investigate the role of some national environmental factors in relation to the\nproportions of women on corporate boards. Our contribution is the introduction of national\nenvironmental context to complement the person-centred and organisation- centred\nexplanations of the glass ceiling. We have identified three significant factors relating the social,\npolitical and economic environments in these forty-three countries to the proportion of women\non boards. The countries where more women have made it to\nthe boardroom are those with women in senior management levels, smaller gender pay gaps\nand a shorter period of women's political representation.\nAround the world, governments have become more aware of the correlation between sex\nequality, particularly in the labour market, and economic growth and prosperity, through their\nlabour and also their role in raising healthier, more highly educated children (Economist,\n2006). Many governments actively monitor the implementation and effectiveness of diversity\npolicies and practices, and use robust research results to design interventions. Gender diversity\nresearch on corporate boards is an important tool, not only for making an academic\ncontribution, but also for providing the basis for change to a more equitable gender\nrepresentation at the decision-making levels of the corporate world. According to the business\ncase, gender diversity at leadership leveloffers a strategic advantage in meeting the challenge\nof globalisation as women can bring their diversity, cross-cultural awareness and\ntransformational leadership skills to their boards (Adler, 1997).\nIn the course of our research, we have identified a number of trends that are important to\nwatch. First, we believe that the changing demographic profile of the workforce in Europe,\nAsia and the Americas may result in more women on the board. For example, in the UK\nlabour force, women are expected to outnumber men by 2018 (WEU, 2002). Second, corporate\ngovernance scandals such as Enron, Worldcom and Parmalat have prompted a new set of\nregulations (e.g. Sarbanes-Oxley Act; Combined Code) concerning the structures and\nprocesses of company boards and the roles and\nresponsibilities of independent directors. Subsequent reports recommend increasing board\ndiversity, including gender representation.\nThe increasing proportion of women in parliaments, as demonstrated in the Nordic countries,\nshould facilitate executive power attention to issues of gender inequality not only in terms of\npolitical representation, as is the case in more than forty countries where quotas for women\n11\nhave recently been introduced (Dahlerup and Freidenvall, 2005), but also in the workplace,\nincluding the presence of women on corporate boards. Norway led in this regard, with action\ntaken in 2002 to introduce legislation for a 40 percent female representation on corporate\nboards within three years. The deadline has now been extended to 2008, with severe\npenalties for non-compliance, including termination of the company. Sweden followed suit\nin May 2006, setting quotas and fines of 15,000 euros. The Finnish EU Presidency held a\nmeeting in October 2006 todiscuss European level strategies to increase women's share of top\nlevel corporate directorships. Similar quota measures are now under serious consideration in\nSpain, Finland and France, and several other countries are watching the outcomes with great\ninterest.\nThis study suggests a number of avenues for future research, including the extension to more\ncountries and the role of other environmental variables. Longitudinal data would enable an\ninvestigation, over time, of the relationship between female director representation and\nenvironmental context.\nReferences\nAcker, J.: 1990. \"Hierarchies, jobs, bodies: A theory of gendered organizations\", Gender and\nSociety, 4 (2), 139-148.\nAdler, N.J.: 1997. \"Global leadership: Women Leaders\", Management International Review,\n37(1), 171-196.\nArken, D.E., S.L.
