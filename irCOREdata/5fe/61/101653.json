Exploration into the process of choosing \na holiday showed that the brochure plays an important role for many consumers. \nHowever, for the travel agent the brochure is low priority, and even when the brochure is \nused, the travel agent often has a considerable amount of influence. Whether or not the \nagency is vertically integrated has considerable influence on the recommendation \nprocess. Based on analysis of the interviews and focus groups, a model was developed, \nand tested using Mystery Shoppers. Results from investigating 156 travel agents across \nthe U.K. indicate that many travel agents owned by large tour operators, will attempt to \npush the holidays of their parent company rather than give impartial advise to consumers. \nTheoretical and practical implications are discussed. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nRecommendations are generally viewed as an important type of information \nconsidered by consumers during the decision-making process (Howard 1963; Peter and \n 3 \nOlson 1993). Some researchers have discovered that rather than simply consulting with \nothers (opinion leaders) for opinions or recommendations, consumers often relinquish \ncontrol of all or part of the decision process to external experts, agents, or surrogates \n(Solomon 1986). In the travel industry, travel agents represent a key influence in the \ntourism marketing system (Bitner and Booms, 1982). In addition to helping travelers \nbook reservations and obtain tickets and vouchers, they influence tourism planning \ndecisions and outcomes. Recommendations of which operator to travel with, may be \ncritical to the success of various tourism businesses.  \n  \nFor marketers it is thus critically important to develop an understanding of the \nfactors that might influence travel agent recommendations. However, given the size and \nthe economic impact of the travel intermediary sector of the tourism industry, \nsurprisingly little research has been reported on travel agencies (Kendall and Booms \n1989; Goldsmith, Flynn and Bonn 1994).  Most previous research has focused on travel \nagents' consumers, dealing with either their search for information and services (Gitelson \nand Crompton 1983; Goldsmith et al. 1994; Hsieh and O'Leary 1993; Snepenger et al. \n1990; Gilbert and Houghton 1991); or with factors which influence their perceptions of \nand response to travel agency advertising (Kendall and Booms 1989; Laskey, Seaton and \nNicholls 1994). In contrast to these studies which focus on potential tourists, only a few \nstudies have focused on travel agents themselves. One study contrasted travel agents' \nperceptions of destination attributes with those of their clients (Michie and Sullivan \n1990), and another (Contant et al. 1988) examined travel agents and the impact of \nterrorism on destination recommendations.  \n 4 \n  \nA more recent study by Klenosky and Gitelson (1998) presented a conceptual \nmodel describing the recommendation process of travel agents (see Figure 1). They \nempirically examined the impact on agents' destination recommendations of two factors \nfrom the model: trip type and origin. Although the study focused on destination choice as \nopposed to brochure\/tour operator choice (as in this piece of research), it was \nacknowledged that the role of travel agent recommendations is a neglected but critically \nimportant area for study, especially in the current environment of increasing competition \nand reduced promotional resources. The authors suggest that additional research is \nneeded to develop new models focusing on the other types of recommendations that \ntourists rely on when making decisions. In particular they suggest one potentially fruitful \ndirection would be to examine the impact on recommendations of specific marketing \ntactics that are typically directed at travel agents such as sales incentives and \ncommissions. Although these promotional tools are widely used, little is currently known \nabout their differential effectiveness in generating business. Such recommendations (as \nhighlighted in bold in the model) are the focus of this study. \n \n \nINTEGRATION IN THE UK TRAVEL INDUSTRY \n \n Expenditure on holidays by the British came to 22.5 billion pounds in 1998 \n(Mintel 1999), representing a four percent share of all consumer spending. In terms of the \ntype of holiday taken by U.K. consumers when they travel abroad, the package holiday or \n 5 \ninclusive tour is at the core of the leisure travel industry's business. In 1997, 28 million \nholidays abroad were taken, of which 15 million were inclusive tours and 13 million were \nindependently organized. The largest three tour operators, Thomson, Airtours, and \nThomas Cook, control about 75% of the market, and each has their own chain of travel \nagencies. Thomson own 791 Lunn Poly agencies, Airtours control 717 Going Places \nbranches and Thomas Cook have over 700 retail outlets under the Thomas Cook and \nCarlson brand names (Buckingham 1999). \n \nTravel agents represent a major communication channel for British travelers \n(Hsieh and O'Leary 1993).  80-90% of inclusive tours are sold through travel agents, \nwhere vertically integrated tour operators are the dominant retailers (Mintel 1999). The \nMonopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) have suggested that the traditional \nmechanism of visiting travel agent, taking away brochures for perusal at home, and \nreturning to the agent to confirm the booking, remains the main retail channel for \nholidays abroad (MMC 1998). The distribution of inclusive tours has come under close \nofficial scrutiny in recent years, and after a recent investigation, the MMC came to the \nconclusion that the vertical integration of tour operators, charter airlines and major travel \nagents, did not affect consumer choice adversely.  \n \nOne practice that was of some concern to the MMC was 'directional selling', \nwhich they define as \u201cthe sale or attempted sale by a vertically integrated travel agent of \nthe foreign package holidays of its linked tour operator, in preference to the holidays of \nother operators\u201d (Monopolies and Mergers Commission 1998: pp4). The practice was \n 6 \nseen as being facilitated by the lack of transparency of ownership links. Independent \ntravel agents and smaller tour operators argue that the vertically integrated travel agents \ndeceive customers by posing as impartial agents when primarily selling their parent \ncompany\u2019s holidays. However, in their investigation, the MMC found no evidence that \ndirectional selling has resulted in less value for money for consumers, and therefore did \nnot rule it to be against the public interest. This has frustrated smaller agents and  \noperators, as well as consumer groups who argue that the practice is anti-competitive and \nleads to limited and biased choice for the consumer when buying a holiday. They also \nargue that the practice is more widespread than the MMC or the larger operators prefer to \nadmit. The MMC ruled that vertical integration in the travel business would not \ncompromise consumer choice so long as the agencies clearly spelled out their ultimate \nownership (MMC 1998). \n \n \nOBJECTIVES \n \nThe objectives of this study were to understand the factors that influence travel \nagency recommendations, and to determine the extent of directional selling in the U.K. \nTo achieve this it was important first to understand the buying process, and in particular, \nthe role of the brochure, for both the trade and consumers. \n  \n \nMETHODOLOGY \n 7 \n \nThe objectives were achieved using a mixture of focus groups, interviews and \n'Mystery Shoppers'. Consumer behaviorists are increasingly embracing qualitative \ntechniques and models in order to deal with relevant topics in meaningful and pragmatic \nways (Walle 1997). Literature suggests that the sensitive use of qualitative (as opposed to \nquantitative) techniques, can contribute immeasurably to better understanding of \nconsumer motivations in vacation selection (Hodgson 1993).  \n  \nThe research design had two main stages, and because the results of the first stage \ndetermined the structure of the second, the details of each will be discussed in turn. \n \n \n1) Interviews and Focus Groups \n \nFive focus group discussions with consumers, lasting between one and one and \nhalf-hours, were conducted in various geographical locations. All consumers had been on \nholiday with a tour operator in the last 2 years and were considering booking a package \nholiday through a travel agent in the next year. These were complimented by two focus \ngroups with travel agencies counter staff and 6 in-depth interviews with managers. As the \nresearch involved two different types of respondent, the focus of the research shifted \nslightly. For example, travel agents were able to give their perspective on how consumers \nuse brochures and those of other companies, and what influenced their decisions. With \n 8 \nconsumers, the emphasis was shifted to the use of the brochure and how travel agents \nmight influence their final decision on which tour operator to travel with. \n \nResults \n \nExploration into the consumer\u2019s perspective of the process of choosing a holiday \nshowed that the brochure plays an important role. There appeared to be two distinct \nroutes to booking a holiday using the brochure. One group would have a country or resort \nin mind and then gather all the relevant brochures. Having looked at the information, they \nwould narrow it down to a few holidays. They would then go into a travel agent with \ntheir options to see what is available. The second group - which seemed to be mainly \nfamilies on a budget - would get all the brochures before consulting the family. They \nwould then look at prices and decide which destinations were possible. They would then \neither go into the travel agency to book a holiday, or telephone the agent to avoid certain \ninconveniences such as taking small children to the shop. For them, the travel agent was a \nkey influence on their final decision, especially in choosing which tour operator to travel \nwith. \n \nFor the travel agent however, the brochure was found to be a low priority, and \noften just used as a reference tool. Other factors, such as vertical integration, tour \noperator commission levels, habit, availability, an efficient View Data system, and \npricing, were found to have considerable influence. The key determining factor appeared \nto be the level of integration, and whether or not the agent was owned by one of the large \n 9 \ntour operators. Based on analysis of this qualitative data, a model was developed for \ntesting (see Figure 2).  \n \nModel Indicating the Role and Influence of the Travel Agent in the U.K. \n  \nThe model suggests that the influence of an agency, and therefore its propensity to \nemploy directional selling, will depend upon the request of the customer. Based on the \nresults of the qualitative data collected, four typical scenarios have been proposed: \n1) Scenario 1: The customer has one specific holiday from one brochure\/operator in \nmind. Here it is hypothesized that the agent has little influence and will most \nlikely make the booking as requested. However, the agent may attempt to switch-\nsell and direct the customer towards the holiday of their parent company. \n2) Scenario 2: The customer has a number of alternatives chosen from different \nbrochures. The authors suggest that the agent will in this case make an attempt to \npush the holiday of their parent company. \n3) Scenario 3: The customer has an amount of money in mind as well as a \ndestination. In this case the agent has strong influence and will recommend the \nholiday of its parent company. \n4) Scenario 4: The customer is looking for a last-minute holiday and calls the agent \nto see what is available. Again, the agent has strong influence over the decision \nthe customer makes and is likely to employ directional selling of parent company \nproducts. \n \n 10 \nIn the second stage of this research, the above scenarios were tested using mystery \nshoppers. \n \n \n2) Mystery Shopping \n \n'Mystery Shoppers' were used to test travel agent recommendations across the \ncountry, with the largest three 'linked' travel agency chains coming under investigation. \n52 agencies from Lunn Poly (owned by Thomson), Going Places (Airtours) and Thomas \nCook or Carlson (Thomas Cook) were sampled. Figure 2 was operationalised and a \nmixture of actual visits (n=36) and telephone calls (n=120) were used to get an insight \ninto what happens when potential holidaymakers walk into a travel agent to book a \nholiday.  \nMystery shopping is a form of participant observation where the researcher \ninteracts with the subjects being observed, and stems from the field of cultural \nanthropology.  However, it differs from the original anthropological approach to \nobservation in terms of its structured and systematic format. In the services context, \nmystery shopping is able to provide information on the service experience as it unfolds \n(Grove and Fisk 1992), and participant observation helps to develop a richer knowledge \nof the experiential nature of services. The participant can identify dimensions of the \nservice encounter unlikely to be discerned by a distant or non-participant observer. \nConcealment of this observation, although raising ethical issues, can ensure that the \nexperience is natural and not contrived for the sake of the observer.  \n 11 \nMystery shopping is used quite extensively by organizations in financial services, \nleisure services, retailing, motor dealerships, hotels and catering, passenger \ntransportation, public utilities and government departments. The main benefit for these \ncompanies is that it gives them a very clear insight into what is happening when their \ncustomers meet their staff. In 1998, mystery shopping was worth over 30 million pounds \na year to British marketing research companies.  However, published academic research \non mystery shopping is limited to a small number of papers that have mainly focused on \nits use in specific sectors (Wilson 1998). Mystery shopping has been used in banking to \nfind out if the institution is addressing the customer\u2019s needs, preferences and priorities \n(Morrall 1994), but to the authors\u2019 knowledge, has not been used by tourism academics \nfor the same purposes. \n \n For the purposes of methodological comparison, a combination of actual visits \nand telephone calls were used to achieve the study objectives. Time constraints limited \nthe visits to 36 linked travel agents in the London area. However, this itself translates \nitself to approximately 18 hours of contact time between mystery shoppers and travel \nagents sales people. In addition, 120 mystery shopping telephone calls were made to the \nthree largest integrated agencies, randomly sampled from an ABTA list of U.K. travel \nagents. Agents were not warned in advance about the research project, as this would have \nreduced the effectiveness of the study considerably. Other researchers have recognized \nthat unconcealed observational methods affect the validity of responses (Grove and Fisk \n1992).  \n 12 \nAttempts were made to maximize the reliability of the exercise through the use of \nobjective measurement and the careful selection and training of the shoppers. It was \nensured that the shoppers matched a customer profile that was appropriate for the \nscenario that they were being asked to act out. Shoppers were trained, through role-plays, \nto adopt a neutral rather than an aggressive or defensive approach in the encounter with \nagents. The training of data collection skills focused on identifying the elements of the \nservice to be observed as well as the retention and recording of the information. \nSubjectivity was minimized by using rating scales with labels, supported by verbatim \ncomments from shoppers to justify their rating selection. For example researchers had to \nrecord how forcibly the agent tried to \u2018switch sell\u2019 on a five-point scale, and then \ncomment on the tactics employed by the agent. \n \n Researchers were given the four different scenarios and a research report form, \nand conducted the research over a period of two weeks. Each interview took an average \nof 30 minutes, whilst the telephone calls averaged out at 15 minutes each. The Market \nResearch Society Code of Conduct specifies that mystery shopping should not involve an \nunreasonable amount of time or expense on behalf of the organization being researched. \nThe researchers in this case only made tentative enquiries (asking about availability) \nrather than positioning themselves as serious buyers. At the end of the encounter the \nresearchers did not reveal themselves to the travel agent, as sometimes is the practice in \nNorth America. Such an approach is viewed by those involved in the U.K. marketing \nresearch industry as being too confrontational (Wilson 1998). \n \n 13 \nResults \n \nThe results of the mystery shopping exercise have been summarized in Table 1, \nand the table indicates the level of directional selling employed as well as the level of \ntransparency (agents indicating that they were owned by a tour operator). Chi-square \nanalysis revealed a significant association between the four different scenarios and the \nlevel of directional selling employed by the travel agents (\u03c72 =31.90, df = 6, p<.001). \nTaken as a whole, of the 156 travel agents approached, 95 (60%) clearly employed \ndirectional selling tactics. However, only 9 of the Thomson owned agencies, Lunn Poly, \nattempted to steer the researchers towards the Thomson product. So aside from Thomson, \n86 of the other 104 agencies (82%) owned by Airtours and Thomas Cook, gave biased \nadvice. 90% of Going Places agencies pushed the Airtours brand, whilst 75% of agencies \nowned by Thomas Cook tried to sell their own brands such as JMC Holidays, Thomas \nCook (mainly long haul) and Inspirations. \n \nWith the actual visits, for the first scenario none of the agents made an attempt to \nswitch-sell and were happy to check availability as requested. For the second scenario, \nwhere the researcher gave the agent 3 options, 7 out of the 9 agents made an attempt to \npush holidays offered by their parent company. Some of this persuasion was of a subtle \nnature (the Lunn Poly agents for example gently convinced the researchers that the \nThomson holiday was far better value for money than the rest). Going Places, however, \nused more force in their attempt to push their Airtours holiday. In the third scenario, \nwhere the researcher had a sum of money and a destination in mind, every single one of \n 14 \nthe 9 agencies visited employed directional selling tactics. Thomas Cook, Going Places, \nand Lunn Poly all attempted to sell the holidays run by their parent companies. In the \nfourth scenario, 6 of the 9 agents asked about late availability pushed holidays belonging \nto their owners. Surprisingly, two Lunn Poly agencies and one Thomas Cook agency \nwere keen to sell an Airtours holiday! This could possibly be explained by the fact that \ntheir parent tour operator just did not have any late availability. \n \nThe researchers were also asked to look for evidence of ownership links, either \nthrough printed material, or through communication with the agents themselves. Only 1 \nof the 36 researchers saw a sign indicating ownership (one Going Places agency had \nsmall signs on the computer indicating links to Airtours). In addition, only 3 of the \nagencies informed the mystery shoppers of their ownership ties. In these cases, the \nownership was used as a selling tactic \u2013 \u201cthis is why we can offer you such a good deal \non insurance\u201d - said one agent. \n \nWith the telephone calls, the Lunn Poly agencies, owned by Thomson, the largest \ntour operator, were unbiased in the information and recommendations they provided. \nThey all gave similar and very helpful answers to all questions asked of them, and at no \ntime made an attempt to push the client towards a Thomson holiday. Their telephone \nmanner was extremely friendly and professional indicating a high and consistent level of \ncustomer service training. In fact 93% of Lunn  Poly agents offered completely unbiased \ninformation. Those few that did recommend a Thomson holiday did so in the last two \n 15 \nscenarios, but this was only 3 from 20 agencies, and could have been based on product \nknowledge and preference rather than internal pressure to sell the Thomson product.  \n \nOn the other hand the agencies from Going Places (owned by Airtours) and \nThomas Cook or Carlson (linked to Thomas Cook), showed strong evidence of \ndirectional selling. In fact 95% of Going Places travel agents made an attempt to push the \nAirtours product, whilst not disclosing the identity of their owner. It was only when asked \nthat they revealed (reluctantly) the name of the operator whose holiday they were \nrecommending. Of those agencies linked to Thomas Cook, 80% employed directional \nselling tactics. Again, they did not freely admit the connection to the tour operators that \nthey have links with, such as JMC, Thomas Cook Holidays and Inspirations. \n \n \nIMPLICATIONS \n \nThe results of this study confirm the significance of travel agent recommendations \nin the decision-making process (Howard 1963; Peter and Olson 1993), as well as \nsupporting the long standing notion that travel agents represent a key influence in the \ntourism marketing system (Bitner and Booms, 1982). The mystery shopping exercise \nsupported the hypothesized model in Figure 2 for two of the vertically integrated \ncompanies, but not for the largest operator, Thomson and their travel agency chain, Lunn \nPoly. Thomson Travel Group have always claimed publicly that they do not have a sales \npolicy of steering customers towards the purchase of Thomson Holidays, and this survey \n 16 \nsupported their claims. This contradicts results from a previous consumer group survey \n(Goldsmith 1997) that suggested Thomson were just as guilty of directional selling as \ntheir competitors.  \n \nCustomers entering a travel agent linked to Airtours and Thomas Cook, however, \nare likely to receive biased recommendations, and a distinct lack of choice. This means \nthat these travel agents are much more likely to put the interests of large tour operators \nbefore the interests of consumers. Ultimately this could mean a consumer ending up on a \npackage holiday unsuited to their needs, as well as being anti-competitive for the \nindustry. Supporters of directional selling (and some have argued that it makes eminent \nbusiness sense to control the chain of supply) suggest that the real issue is whether the \nconsumer is being left to believe they are getting the best independent advice to suit their \nholiday needs. The mystery shoppers used for this piece of research did not believe they \nwere receiving such advice except from the Lunn Poly agents. \n \nThe results also showed that the vertically integrated companies are not \ncomplying with Office of Fair Trading demands to make their ownership links more \ntransparent. Both the vertically integrated companies that employed directional selling \nfailed to disclose their ownership ties, and some were very reluctant to do so when asked. \nThe Monopolies and Mergers Commission suggest that the lack of transparency means \nthat consumers shop around less for holidays, with the result that there is less competitive \npressure on travel agents. Consumers are therefore likely to get less value for money \n(MMC 1998).  \n 17 \n \nMethodologically, there were a few subtle differences between the mystery \nshopping visits as opposed to the telephone calls. For the visits in the first scenario, none \nof the agents attempted to switch-sell, but 12 of the 30 agents called by phone made an \nattempt to change the caller\u2019s plans. Perhaps in person, the travel agent saw more of an \nopportunity to close a sale and therefore did not want to confuse the customer. When they \ndid attempt to direct the researcher towards their tour operator, the agents visited in \nperson employed much more subtle tactics, often spending considerable time explaining \nwhy the customer should chose another product. This was the case even for the Lunn \nPoly agents who were reported to use less force than the other two chains. However, \nwhen called by telephone, the Lunn Poly agents were completely unbiased, and their \ntelephone manner and professionalism indicated a high and consistent level of customer \n\u2018tele-sales\u2019 service training. \n \nThe study has also shown the advantages of direct observational data collection \nmethods in the tourism sector. Mystery shopping will continue to grow as a result of the \nincreasing emphasis being put on service quality and service standards (Wilson 1988). To \ndate, the distinctive capabilities of observational methodologies for investigating services \nphenomena have not been widely recognized. Unfortunately, direct observation can be \ncostly, time consuming and sometimes infeasible. In this study, mystery shopping, whilst \nbeing extremely effective, was very time consuming. Concealed observation also raises \nconcerns over the research\u2019s ethical nature. Whilst reducing the risk of \u2018unnatural\u2019 \nsubject behavior, concealed observation represents an unannounced intrusion, and may \n 18 \nviolate rights to privacy. In this study, the authors were sensitive to the ethical \nramifications of mystery shopping, but recognized that to glean the most accurate \ninformation, it was necessary to employ a concealed observational approach. \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nIn a mature package holiday market, shareholder demands for constantly-\nimproved profits have left the vertically integrated tour operators with three choices. \nThey can increase prices, but risk losing market share. Alternatively they can cut prices to \ngain market share, at the risk of also cutting earnings and perhaps sparking a price war. \nAnother option is to ensure those who sell holidays sell their holidays rather than \ncompetitors, and that means buying distribution or influencing travel agents. For the time \nbeing it is clear that the big tour operators have chosen the latter tactic. This research has \nshown that two of the three largest vertically integrated travel companies in the U.K. \nactively employ directional selling tactics. It is not the purpose of this paper to suggest \nthat this has an adverse affect on the consumer, and the travel industry in general, but the \nissue clearly requires further debate. More importantly, the study, and its use of mystery \nshopping as a powerful research technique, has highlighted the critical role that travel \nagents play in the decision process of consumers. Nearly 20 years ago Bitner and Booms \n(1982) observed that retail travel agents played a pivotal role in the tourism distribution \nchannel. Despite the impact of technology and the advent of on-line bookings, these \nobservations still stand. \n 19 \n \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nBitner, M.J. and Booms, B.H. (1982).
