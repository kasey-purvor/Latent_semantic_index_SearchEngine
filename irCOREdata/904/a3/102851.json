Providing\nsuch diverse QoS in the face of rapidly changing\nlink and traffic scenarios requires a new\napproach to radio resource management (RRM)\nin the form of the resource metric estimator\n(RME) [1]. Current RRM functionality in sec-\nond-generation (2G) and 3G systems utilize\nwireless physical resources directly without inter-\nmediate layers. Research work incorporating an\nRRM that takes into account the conditions of\nthe physical layer resources suggests the need to\nfocus on its potential impact in the intermediate\nlayer (i.e., radio RME), which can be aware of\nthe cross-layer capabilities and states. Based on\nthe knowledge of the desired loads and channel\nand radio resources, the RRM in cooperation\nwith the RME can manage both up and down\nthe protocol stack. Thus, it can decide and con-\ntrol the parameters and functions required to\noptimize the desired features such as QoS,\nthroughput, power utilization, and overall system\ncapacity.\nResource metric estimation is a crucial part of\nthe radio resource allocation (RRA) algorithm\nthat performs call admission control (CAC),\nresource scheduling, and power\/rate scheduling.\nWith its in-built capacity models, the RME:\n\u2022 Uses the radio channel characteristics and\nsession quality requirements for optimal\npower and rate allocation\n\u2022 Uses the current channel load, characteris-\ntics, and quality requirements to control the\nresource scheduler\n\u2022 Assists the CAC in accepting or rejecting\nnew sessions\nFigure 1 is an illustration as to how an RME\ncould interact with the other RRA algorithms in\nthe base station (BS).\nAlso of interest is the air interface likely to\nbe adopted in fourth-generation (4G) systems.\nFrom the RRM point of view, a multicarrier-\nbased CDMA system is a good air interface can-\ndidate since it has the flexibility of a common\npool of available resource units (RUs) such as\nfrequency unit and code slot unit. In this section\nwe describe the use of RME in both a conven-\ntional CDMA system and a generic multicode\nmulticarrier CDMA (MC2-CDMA) system.\nABSTRACT\nIn this article the fourth in a series of four\noffers as a compilation of material which has\nbeen presented in detail elsewhere (see refer-\nences within the article).

This aim is similar\nto that of the interface between link and system\nlevel simulations. A solution for efficient inter-\nworking between the physical layer and higher\nlayers \u2014 the resource metric mapping function\n(RMMF) \u2014 is proposed [2]. The RMMF deals\nwith this issue by monitoring the mean of the\nsignal-to-interference ratio (SIR) bursts and also\nthe availability of the code pool by estimating\nthe standard deviation of SIR bursts. The\nRMMF is defined and demonstrated by means\nof an average raw bit error rate (BER) mapping\nfunction as a function of the mean and standard\ndeviation of SIR bursts, as shown in Fig. 2,\nwhich was obtained via Monte Carlo simulation\nof a time-division duplex (TDD)-CDMA system\nas defined within the Universal Mobile Telecom-\nmunications System (UMTS).\nBy using the RMMF, the link quality in terms\nof average raw BER observed by a user can be\ndetermined very accurately. Furthermore, in\nhigher layers this mapping function can be used\nas a resource lookup table, having actual radio\nmobile channel and interference characteristics,\nand as a monitor of resource availability.\nRRA WITH PREDICTIVE LOAD-BASED RME\nIn an aggregated traffic stream the estimation\nof available resources can be either optimistic\nor conservative due to inaccurate link quality\ninformation and the coarse estimation of over-\nflow traffic, resulting in under-exploitation of\nthe RUs. If we know the resource availability\n(i.e., the required total average resource plus\nthe excessive resource that cannot be utilized\ndue to stringent call admission criteria), this\ninformation allows the acceptable resource\nmetric region (RMR) to be established on a\ncall, packet, or time slot basis, thus enabling\nthe RRA algorithm to maximize resource uti-\nlization.\nOne approach to this concept is where the\nmeasurement of SIR and traffic is followed by a\nKalman-based prediction utilizing the measure-\nn Figure 1.

This provides measured or predicted\nresource parameters for the resource scheduler\nto search their current position on the surface of\nthe RMMF and deliver the actual status of\nresource usage [3].\nRME WITH DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE LEVELS IN\nW-CDMA AND MULTICODE MC-CDMA\nAs mentioned in the previous section, in con-\nventional systems, due to stringent call admis-\nsion criteria some underutilized resource can\nexist in a wireless system. An estimate of this\nfree resource and the level of confidence in its\navailability will clearly aid in its utilization.\nThus, we have proposed a predictive RMR-\nbased RME with a degree of confidence level\n(DCL) of capacity and user status that can\ndeliver the available capacity of resource margin\nconsidering the systematic error [3, 4]. The\nDCL is defined as the capacity status by com-\nparing the optimal capacity limit and the pes-\nsimistic capacity limit to estimated current user\nstatus with the amount of the predicted varia-\ntion of the available number of users from the\nKalman predictor. By using this DCL parame-\nter, the current and predicted capacity statuses\nof users are delivered to the RRA algorithm to\naccept or reject a new coming call. Figure 3\nshows the admissible and residual aggregate\ndata rate (ADR, i.e., total data rate) with\/with-\nout DCL in terms of frame index for a wide-\nband CDMA (WCDMA) system and an\nMC2-CDMA system (similar simulation param-\neters were assumed). It is demonstrated that the\nDCL of MC2-CDMA is relatively higher than\nthat of WCDMA, which means that for the\nMC2-CDMA system, the fidelity of information\nof the capacity status is more reliable than for\nWCDMA since long-term fading is assumed in\nour study. The performance is clearly dependent\non the quality of the precited behavior, and Fig.\n3 illustrates the performance of several meth-\nods, discussed in detail in [2\u20134].\nSELF-ORGANIZING RADIO NETWORKS\nINTRODUCTION\nDespite the offering of new services and\nadvanced technologies of UMTS, the network\nplanning approach is an old one, resulting in\ninefficiencies in spectrum usage, cost of infra-\nstructure, capacity, and cost. This is mainly due\nto two reasons. First, wireless radio networks are\nfully dynamic in nature as the system status\ndepends on not only geographical variations but\nalso interference variations. Coverage and capac-\nity have to be considered jointly, and more work\nhas to be done in the network optimization stage\nrather than in the network planning stage. Sec-\nond, the schemes for RRA such as admission\/\ncongestion control, power control, and handover\nmechanisms in UMTS are based on fixed and\npredetermined parameters, and operate in an\nisolated manner without support from each\nother.\nTherefore, it appears that there is an urgent\nneed for research in autonomous, intelligent,\nadaptive, and flexible yet robust control mecha-\nnisms for UMTS. Provision of such an intelligent\nmechanism could potentially change the conven-\ntional and old communication infrastructure\nplanning and design procedures and pave the\nway toward a more effective approach to provid-\ning UMTS. These are the driving forces behind\nthe importance of research on self-planning\/plan-\nning radio networks.\nA self-organizing network should intelligently\nrespond to the dynamics of the system quickly\nand transparently to users to achieve better cov-\nerage, capacity, and QoS, and hence ultimately\nyielding high radio spectrum efficiencies. To\nachieve this goal, it needs to take into account\nthe dynamics of the system (traffic, service\ndemand, mobility, channel fading conditions)\nand use them in the RRM process (CAC, hand-\nover\/soft handover [HO\/SHO], power control\n[PC], spreading factors, etc.) continually and\nautomatically.\nSTRUCTURE OF SELF-ORGANIZING\nRADIO NETWORKS\nThe main functions of achieving defined self-\norganizing features can be addressed as follows.\nTracking system dynamics \u2014 automatic cell\ncoverage estimation: Cell coverage in a CDMA-\nbased mobile system is highly irregular and time\nvarying, heavily depending on traffic and propa-\ngation variations. Therefore, cell coverage esti-\nmation in such a system is fairly difficult.\nHowever, in future mobile communications sys-\ntems, RRA should be fully adaptive to system\ndynamics such as propagation and traffic varia-\ntions, where instant cell coverage potentially\nprovides a new dimension to RRA strategies.\nIntegrated RRA strategy: From a user\u2019s point\nof view, an intelligent and integrated resource\nallocation scheme should be applied. This\nn Figure 3.

Also, the main\nfunctions work in an integrated way where they\nare jointly considered to support each other,\nhence achieving flexible trade-off between link\nquality and resource utilization. Moreover, an\nintegrated RRA scheme should exhibit robust-\nness, which, through adaptation to system\ndynamics and monitoring qualities in both links,\nwill inherently change each user\u2019s behavior,\nthereby achieving a stable system performance\nregardless of the system situation.\nTherefore, in a self-organizing radio network,\nestimated cell coverage information is applied to\nthe RRA strategy. Moreover, the radio resource\nis allocated in an integrated way in that first, the\nuplink and downlink are considered together to\nbalance their link qualities, and second, different\nresource allocation schemes such as CAC and\nSHO work in an integrated manner to support\neach other. Furthermore, the link qualities or\noverall system performance are fed back to the\nresource allocation strategy to enhance its\nrobustness.\nAUTOMATIC CELL COVERAGE ESTIMATION\nAn automatic coverage algorithm should be\ntransparent to users, and change with the up-to-\ndate system propagation and traffic dynamics. In\nthe proposed estimation algorithm the cell area\nis divided into regular bins, and all the users\nlocated in a bin are considered in the center of\nthe bin. Periodically, all active users measure\nand report back to the Node-B their locations\nand received Eb\/I0. The Node-B contains a data\nmatrix, recording the Eb\/I0 samples from each\nbin. Based on enough such samples, the network\ndecides the coverage of each bin, according to\nthe location probability required. The coverage\ninformation of all the bins together forms a cov-\nerage map of the desired cell. Furthermore, a\ncell boundary map can be derived from the cov-\nerage map if required.\nIn order to implement this algorithm in a\npractical system, a two-stage mechanism is pro-\nposed. We divide the estimation process into two\ndifferent stages: training and updating. The\ntraining stage is the initial stage, which is long-\nterm, to collect enough measurements from each\nbin for the algorithm to converge. Once the\nalgorithm reaches its convergence, the first cov-\nerage map of the cell of interest is obtained.\nAfter that, the process turns to the regular stage,\nor the updating stage, where the new incoming\nmeasurement set will replace the most out-of-\ndate measurement set. Based on the updated\nmatrix, a new coverage map is produced. By\napplying this mechanism, a new coverage map\ncan be achieved after a measurement interval\ntime of, say, 500 ms.\nINTEGRATED RESOURCE ALLOCATION STRATEGY\nThe proposed integrated resource allocation\nstrategy consists of an adaptive SHO algorithm\nand an adaptive CAC scheme working together\nto optimize the resource allocation and to bal-\nance the link qualities. In this strategy the link\nquality indicators are defined that are able to\nreflect both current and previous link situations.\nThey are then incorporated with SHO and CAC\nto construct adaptive thresholds. The dynamic\nthresholds are designed in such a way that they\nwill improve one link without impairing another.\nMoreover, adaptive SHO and CAC will work in\nan integrated and balanced manner to achieve\ntarget link outage probabilities in both links as\nmuch as possible.\nFurthermore, the estimated cell coverage\ninformation is applied to SHO thresholds in a\ndistributed way. If a piece of user equipment\u2019s\n(UE\u2019s) location is covered by the serving cell and\nnot covered by the target cell, both of its adding\nand dropping thresholds will increase. If the\nUE\u2019s location is not covered by the serving cell\nwhile covered by the target cell, both thresholds\nwill reduce 1 dB. The thresholds will not change\notherwise.\nPERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS\nIt can be observed from Fig. 4 that the proposed\nself-organizing radio network noticeably\nimproves service qualities. Compared to a fixed-\nparameters-based UMTS terrestrial radio access\n(UTRA) network, it achieves lower call blocking\nrate as well as lower call dropping rate, jointly\nresulting in a better grade of service (GoS), par-\nticularly in heavily loaded scenarios. As a conse-\nquence, it further shows that the satisfied user\nrate (Rs) in the proposed network is improved\ncompared to the UTRA network. A satisfied\nuser is defined as a user who is not blocked or\ndropped, and whose link quality is above the tar-\nget for more than 95 percent of the communica-\ntion.\nThe results in Fig. 5 demonstrate the aver-\naged transmission powers in decibels for Node-B\nand UE that are normalized by their maximum\ntransmission powers, respectively. It shows that\nn Figure 4.

Furthermore, the\npower consumption required from a UE is simi-\nlar to that in a UTRA network, and under heavy\ncell load it uses slightly less power. It has to be\nnoted that these power assumptions are achieved\nin a system where the supported users are more\nthan in a UTRA network, due to the lower call\nblocking rate.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThis article, the fourth of four, has presented the\ntechnical activities within Mobile VCE\u2019s Wire-\nless Access research area. Since the research was\ndefined and driven by the leading companies in\nmobile communications, the research naturally\nfocused on the provision of wireless access in\nfuture networks.\nLow-inertia radio resource metric estimation\nalgorithms were shown to cope with the higher\nsystem capacity accomplished by the aforemen-\ntioned single- and multi-user transceiver designs.\nThe high performance of such algorithms has\nbeen attributed to an optimized cross-layer\ndesign. In addition, self-planning and dynamical-\nly reconfigurable CDMA networks have been\nconsidered, where it is recognized that algo-\nrithms enabling dynamic optimization of net-\nwork performance with varying traffic and\npropagation conditions will be important for\nfuture wireless networks.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the efforts of\nthe following colleagues in contributing to all\nfour articles in this series.\nIndustrial Steering Group Members: The\nresearch of Mobile VCE\u2019s Core 2 Wireless\nAccess work area described in this article was\noverseen by an Industrial Steering Group that\ncomprised representatives of the following com-\npanies: BBC, BT, Fujitsu, Inmarsat, Lucent,\nMotorola, NEC, Orange, Philips, Nortel, Pana-\nsonic, Samsung, Siemens, Texas Instruments,\nThales, Toshiba, and Vodafone.
