Introduction\n[2] Strong westerly winds cause equatorward Ekman\ntransport and deep water upwelling in the area of the ACC\n[Toggweiler and Samuels, 1998; Wunsch and Ferrari,\n2004]. This upwelling is responsible for the density struc-\nture of the ACC, with steep isopycnals that connect the deep\nocean with the surface mixed layer. This is one of the few\nregions of the ocean where such direct communication\nbetween upper and deep ocean occurs. For this reason, the\nACC region is very important for global atmosphere\u2010ocean\nheat and CO2 exchanges [Rintoul et al., 2001; Thompson,\n2008].\n[3] The Southern Annular Mode has evolved during the\npast four decades towards a state with intensified westerlies\n[Thompson and Solomon, 2002; Marshall, 2003; Jacobs,\n1997]. In non\u2010eddy resolving Ocean General Circulation\nModels (OGCMs), a strengthening of the Southern Ocean\nwesterlies leads to enhanced northward Ekman transport,\nsteeper isopycnals, and a stronger ACC [Fyfe and Saenko,\n2006; Bi et al., 2002; Saenko et al., 2005]. It has been\nargued that the increase in poleward deep flow needed to\ncompensate for a larger equatorward Ekman transport at the\nsurface must be accompanied by a strengthening of the\nAMOC [Toggweiler et al., 1989a, 1989b]. This link\nbetween southern hemisphere westerlies and AMOC has so\nfar been found only in OGCMs with low diapycnal diffu-\nsivities [Toggweiler and Samuels, 1998]. Gnanadesikan\n[1999] developed an insightful theory linking the AMOC\nwith the two competing contributions of Ekman transport\nand eddy effects in the Southern Ocean. This theory was\nfurther explored by Hallberg and Gnanadesikan [2001]\nwith an idealized channel model.\n[4] B\u00f6ning et al. [2008] have recently investigated the\nimpact of the changes in surface fluxes observed during the\npast 50 years on the density structure of theACC.A surprising\nresult of their study is the absence of noticeable changes in the\nslope of the isopycnals in response to the strengthening of the\nwesterlies. They attribute this insensitivity to the enhanced\npoleward eddy transport, that counterbalances the also larger\nnorthward Ekman flow. This mechanism of eddy compen-\nsation, or saturation, was first advanced by Straub [1993], and\nis confirmed by several eddy resolving and eddy permitting\nsimulations [e.g., Farneti et al., 2010; Hogg et al., 2008;\nHallberg and Gnanadesikan, 2006].\n[5] We investigate eddy compensation in a non\u2010eddy\nresolving OGCM with a time\u2010dependent, three\u2010dimensional\neddy diffusivity parameterization. We show that the\nparameterized eddy response to changing winds can quali-\ntatively reproduce the observational findings and the results\nof eddy\u2010resolving models.\n2. Parameterizations of Baroclinic Eddies\n[6] In the Gent and McWilliams [1990] (GM) parame-\nterization, eddy transports are calculated as\nu* \u00bc \u0002@z KGMS\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe rh \u0003 KGMS\u00f0 \u00dek; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere u* is the bolus velocity, S = \u2212rh%\/\u2202z% is the iso-\npycnal slope, % is the locally referenced potential density,\nrh is the horizontal gradient operator, KGM is the thickness\ndiffusivity, and k is an upward\u2010pointing unit vector.\n[7] With a few exceptions [e.g., Griffies et al., 2005; Eden\net al., 2008; Emile\u2010Geay and Madec, 2009; Farneti et al.,\n2010], KGM has a constant and uniform value in OGCMs.\nA more physical parameterization can be formulated fol-\nlowing Larichev and Held [1995] and Visbeck et al. [1997],\nnamely,\nKGM \u00bc \u0002L2\u0003; \u00f02\u00de\n1Earth System Analysis, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact\nResearch, Potsdam, Germany.\n2National Oceanography Centre, Natural Environment Research\nCouncil, Liverpool, UK.\nCopyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094\u20108276\/11\/2010GL045972\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 38, L03605, doi:10.1029\/2010GL045972, 2011\nL03605 1 of 5\nwhere L is a mixing length, \u0003 = fRi\u2212\n1\n2 is the vertical average\nof the Eady [1949] growth rate, with Ri the vertically\naveraged Richardson number and f the Coriolis parameter,\nand a is a tuning parameter.\n[8] The Larichev and Held [1995] and Visbeck et al.\n[1997] approaches only differ in their choice of L. While\nLarichev and Held [1995] used the baroclinic Rossby radius,\nVisbeck et al. [1997] proposed to take L as the maximum of\nthe Rossby radius, LR, the model grid size, and the width of\nthe baroclinic zone. Hallberg and Gnanadesikan [2001]\ndiscussed the eddy flux scalings associated with the para-\nmeterizations of Larichev and Held [1995] and Visbeck et al.\n[1997], and concluded that the former performs better near\neddy saturation, while the latter is most successful away from\nsaturation. The simulations of Bryan et al. [1999] suggested,\nhowever, that the local Rossby radius might be the best\nchoice for L.\n[9] Values of KGM diagnosed from eddy resolving models\nshow that KGM is not vertically uniform. In the Southern\nOcean, KGM attains values of 1000\u20133000 m\n2 s\u22121 in the\nupper 1000 m of the water column, but is ten times smaller\nin the deep. To account for this vertical structure, Eden et al.\n[2008] use a three\u2010dimensional Richardson number Ri in\ntheir calculations of s.\n[10] In our numerical experiments, we use thickness\ndiffusivities calculated according to (2), where, following\nBryan et al. [1999], a = 0.13, L = LR and \u0003 is replaced by\ns = f Ri\u2212\n1\n2. The diffusivity KGM is not allowed to stray\noutside the interval [300,3000] m2s\u22121, but is otherwise\npermitted to vary in space and time. We use the quadratic\ntapering of Gerdes et al. [1991] with critical slope of 0.01\nfor the Redi diffusivity, and a similar, but linear, tapering\nwith critical slope of 0.0025 for KGM. Near the surface,\nboth Redi and KGM diffusivities are further tapered using\nthe formulation of Large et al. [1997].\n3. Model and Experimental Design\n[11] The model consists of an OGCM based on the\nModular Ocean Model version 3 coupled to an anomaly\nmodel of the atmospheric energy\u2010moisture balance [Hofmann\nand Morales Maqueda, 2006]. The horizontal resolution is\n3\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0. The model has 29 vertical levels with thickness\nincreasing from 10 m at the surface to 405 m at the bottom.\nIt incorporates a parameterization of bottom\u2010enhanced\nvertical mixing [Hasumi and Suginohara, 1999], with a\nvertical background diffusivity of 10\u22125 m2s\u22121. The vertical\nmixing scheme of Large et al. [1994] is used to represent\nFigure 1. (a) Annual mean of KGM zonally averaged between 30\u00b0 W and 30\u00b0 E for simulation GM_VAR (in m\n2s\u22121). The\ncontours are the annual mean zonal currents (in cm s\u22121). (b) Changes in the fields depicted in Figure 1a at the end of the\n200\u2010year integration with ramped up winds.\nHOFMANN AND MORALES MAQUEDA: EDDY FLUXES IN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN L03605L03605\n2 of 5\nturbulent effects in the mixed layer. Redi diffusivities are\nalways equal to the 3\u2010dimensional field of eddy thickness\ndiffusivities, which is updated every time step. A second order\nmoment tracer advection scheme greatly reduces the amount\nof spurious numerical diffusion and dispersion [Hofmann and\nMoralesMaqueda, 2006]. Climatologicalmonthlymeanwind\nstresses and all other atmospheric forcing were extracted from\nthe NCEP\/NCAR reanalysis data base [Kalnay et al., 1996].\n[12] The model was spun up for 3000 years. An annually\naveraged field of eddy thickness diffusivities was diagnosed\nfrom this spin\u2010up. Subsequently, three 1000\u2010year integra-\ntions were completed using as initial conditions the ocean\nstate at the end of the spin\u2010up. The first integration\n(GM_VAR) was a continuation of the spin\u2010up. In the sec-\nond integration (GM_FROZ), the eddy thickness diffusivity\nfield was prescribed from the long\u2010term annual mean of KGM\nin the spin\u2010up run. In the third integration (GM_MEAN),\nKGM was constant and spatially uniform, with a value of\n350 m2s\u22121, the long\u2010term annual mean of the global average\nof KGM in the spin\u2010up. To assess the model\u2019s sensitivity to\nwind changes, each 1000\u2010year integration was continued for\nanother 200 years, similarly to Farneti et al. [2010]. During\nthe first 40 years of this 200\u2010year period, the wind stress\nwithin the 40\u00b0 S\u201380\u00b0 S latitude band was ramped up linearly\nin time by 100% (an anomaly of size comparable to that of\nFarneti et al. [2010]). The wind stress was maintained at\nthis anomalous level during the remaining 160 years of\nintegration.\n4. Results and Discussion\n[13] The climatological mean states of the GM_VAR and\nGM_FROZ simulations are very similar, and compare well\nwith observations [Levitus and Boyer, 1994]. The maximum\nstrength of the AMOC is 19.5 Sv (1 Sv = 106m3s\u22121), and the\ndeep South Atlantic outflow at 35\u00b0 S is 17 Sv. The ACC\ntransport is 80 Sv, with little interannual variability. This\ntransport is too small, but consistent with simulations of\nother non\u2010eddy resolving models. The baroclinic ACC\ntransport between 60\u00b0 S and 40\u00b0 S (estimated from the\nmeridional gradient of the baroclinic potential energy\nanomaly above 1900 m, as in work by B\u00f6ning et al. [2008])\namounts to about 50 Sv, which is almost two thirds of the\ntotal ACC transport, in good agreement with the calcula-\ntions of B\u00f6ning et al. [2008].\n[14] Before the wind stress anomaly is applied, the zonally\nintegrated northward Ekman drift at the latitude of Cape\nHorn is 23.5 Sv. The parameterized eddy flow partly\ncounteracts the Ekman drift, reducing the northward volume\ntransport to 8.5 Sv. This eddy flow is largely concentrated in\nthe upper 500 m.\n[15] Figure 1a shows the annual mean of the KGM field in\nsimulation GM_VAR zonally averaged between 30\u00b0 W and\n30\u00b0 E before the southern hemisphere winds are ramped up.\nSuperimposed to KGM are the contours of the annual mean\nzonal current. In qualitative agreement with KGM patterns\ndiagnosed by Ferreira et al. [2005] and Eden et al. [2008],\nthickness diffusivities are largest in the general area of the\nACC. However, there are significant differences in the\nspatial distribution of diffusivities, and we acknowledge that\nour results may be sensitive to these differences.\n[16] The doubling of the wind stress in GM_VAR causes\nan increase in KGM of 25\u201350% in the area of the ACC\n(Figure 1b). There is also a strengthening of the ACC, which\ntransports 115 Sv by the end of the simulation. The south-\nward, annual mean meridional bolus transport in the upper\n1900 m of the water column increases by 10 Sv (Figure 2a),\nFigure 2. Change in the annual mean, meridional bolus\ntransport (in Sv) at the end of the 200\u2010year integration with\nramped up winds: (a) GM_VAR; (b) GM_FROZ; and\n(c) GM_MEAN.\nHOFMANN AND MORALES MAQUEDA: EDDY FLUXES IN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN L03605L03605\n3 of 5\nan increase caused directly by the steepening of the iso-\npycnals and indirectly by the larger KGM values. (Time\nseries of the maximum value of KGM in experiment\nGM_VAR are shown in Figure S1.)1 The meridional bolus\ntransport also becomes stronger in simulations GM_FROZ\nand GM_MEAN after the wind stress is ramped up, but the\nincrease is weaker and shallower than in GM_VAR\n(Figures 2b and 2c). (Time series of the meridional bolus\ntransport are shown in Figure S2.)\n[17] The different responses of the meridional bolus\ntransport in GM_MEAN, GM_FROZ and GM_VAR are\nreflected in their corresponding isopycnal slope changes.\nFigure 3 shows how the annual mean contours of s1\n(potential density referred to a depth of 1000 m minus\n1000 kg m\u22123) react to a doubling of the wind stress by the end\nof the simulation. The maximum slope of the s1 = 27.60 kg\nm\u22123 increases by 30%, 66% and 70% in GM_VAR,\nGM_FROZ and GM_MEAN, respectively. (A time series\nof the isopycnal slopes can be found in Figure S3.) The\nchanges in the ACC baroclinic transport are, accordingly,\nmuch smaller in GM_VAR (+22 Sv \u2248 +44%) than in\nGM_FROZ (+35 Sv \u2248 +70%) and GM_MEAN (+45 Sv \u2248\n+75%), which demonstrates the effectiveness of the eddy\nparameterization of GM_VAR in stabilizing the ACC.\n[18] Since ACC eddy dynamics should be a control of the\nAMOC [Gnanadesikan, 1999], we have also investigated\nthe impact of the different eddy parameterizations on the\nresponse of the modeled AMOC to southern hemisphere\nwind variability. Figure S4 demonstrates indeed the\nimportance that eddy compensation has for the modeled\nAMOC. In the same way as the ACC baroclinic transport\nresponse to the imposed wind perturbation is about double\nin GM_MEAN than in GM_VAR (GM_FROZ is not\nshown), the accompanying increase in the AMOC is also\nalmost twice as large in the former than in the latter.\n5. Summary\n[19] A sophisticated formulation of the Gent and\nMcWilliams [1990] thickness diffusivity has allowed us to\nsimulate with some success the response of Southern Ocean\neddies to changing midlatitude westerlies. An increase in the\nwind stress prompts a more vigorous northward Ekman\ntransport and, hence, an initial steepening of the isopycnals.\nThis steepening leads, in turn, to the creation of eddies that\ncounteract the initial Ekman transport. The GM parameter-\nization with constant and uniform eddy diffusivities is not\nable to appropriately represent this eddy compensation. We\nnote that Farneti et al. [2010], with a vertically uniform\nformulation \u00e0 la Visbeck et al. [1997] fail also to approach\neddy compensation, partly because the Visbeck et al. [1997]\nformulation is less effective than the one by Larichev and\nHeld [1995] near eddy saturation, but also because they\nuse smaller maximum thickness diffusivities and capping\nisopycnal slopes than we do. Using an eddy diffusivity that\nis a function of the internal Rossby radius and the mean\u2010\nflow Richardson number, a higher level of eddy compen-\nsation is attained. However, although the parameterized\neffective diffusivities attain maximum values comparable to\nthose deduced from eddy\u2010resolving simulations [e.g.,\nMarshall et al., 2006], the eddy formulation does not lead to\nlevels of compensation as high as suggested by observations\nand eddy\u2010resolving models.\n[20] Because the enhanced negative eddy feedback in the\nmodel, the simulatedACCbecomes less sensitive towind stress\nchanges, in qualitative agreement with observations [B\u00f6ning\net al., 2008] and eddy\u2010resolving models [Farneti et al., 2010;\nHogg et al., 2008; Hallberg and Gnanadesikan, 2006]. The\nsensitivity of the AMOC to changes in the midlatitude\nwesterlies of the southern hemisphere is also moderated by\neddy compensation in the ACC, as expected from the theory\nof Gnanadesikan [1999]. Extrapolating from these results, we\nanticipate that, if full eddy compensation were attained, nei-\nther the ACC nor the AMOC would respond to such wind\nvariability. However, eddy compensation should not be\nexpected to hold for a large decrease in wind strength. Below\na certain wind threshold, eddy activity will be too weak for\ncompensation to occur, and the AMOC and the ACC should\nthen become more sensitive to wind changes.\n[21] Acknowledgment.
