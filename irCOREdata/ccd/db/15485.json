This paper considers the deconstructive force of climate\nchange in intellectual and political life, especially as it undermines and\nchallenges the terms of consumer democracy and the liberal tradition in\npolitical thought. The first half of the paper gauges this deconstructive\nforce in relation to Derrida\u2019s legacy, arguing that environmental\nquestions open an arena of deconstructive events foreclosed in\nDerrida\u2019s own work. The second half considers the deconstructive\nforce of climate change in relation to literary ecocriticism, the study\nof literature and the environment.\n\u2018I\u2019m not against motorists. It is a matter of individual right. Within the\nprivacy of their own homes, everyone should be free to drive a private\ncar as far as they like.\u2019\nClimate Change as Deconstruction\nIs there something a bit suspicious in the ease with which one can\nadapt an account of the challenges posed by climate change to some\nnow familiar Derridian arguments? We could describe the current\nstate of the world as a generalisation of the condition of aporia\nin countless domains of life and thought, many never previously\nconceived as political or as involving decisions of much consequence\nat all (e.g. use of air conditioning) and so, one might continue, we\nare presented at every turn with a situation no longer intelligible in\nThe Oxford Literary Review 32.1 (2010): 131\u2013149\nEdinburgh University Press\nDOI: 10.3366\/E0305149810000684\n\u00a9 The Oxford Literary Review\nwww.eupjournals.com\/olr\n132 Oxford Literary Review\nterms programmable by the past, one, that is, now calling for genuine\ndecision and responsibility amid the incalculable which is both their\ncondition and moral necessity. In thus forcing a drastic rethink of the\nterms of innumerable inherited practices and thought, climate change\ncould be said to open a new space for reconsideration and invention,\netc. However, in 2010, this all seems in danger of stating the obvious.\nTo lay out some formal characteristics of a mode of thought and\naction is only a step. Geoffrey Bennington reminds us:\nDerrida\u2019s regular appeals to the need for invention in the\nfields of ethics or politics necessarily disappoint: we would\nobviously like to be told what to invent\u2014 at which point we\nwould be released from the responsibility of invention. . . .1\nFollowing this, it may be a sign of a stagnation encroaching upon\ndeconstructive thinking that, if asked to respond to the challenge of an\nissue such as climate change never considered by Derrida, for many the\nreflex would be to argue, somehow, how well he had covered it already.\nIn fact, environmental questions look like a perplexing and seemingly\nexpanding absence or even evasion in Derrida\u2019s thinking, one it is still\nhard to know how to understand or address.2\nThe kind of invention demanded would presumably be less a\nmatter of the reading of some text, argument or cultural legacy\nthan of the keeping pace intellectually with an event whose scale,\ncomplexity and incalculability is such as to resist representation\nor being conceptualised. Climate change seems a happening whose\ntrauma is to enact or entail the deconstruction of multiple frames\nof reference in multiple fields and modes of thought at the same\ntime (e.g. politics, economics, ethics, cultural history, urban planning).\nLeigh Glover argues that climate change marks the \u2018end of modernity,\u2019\ndefining \u2018modernity\u2019 as the assumption that the natural world exists\nfor human ends, the dominance of liberal-democratic systems of\ngovernment embedded in market capitalism, and the privilege given to\nscientific knowledge as the solely reliable guide in managing the social\nand natural worlds.3\nA concept used often by Derrida during the 1960s, \u2018closure\u2019, may\nbe a better word than Glover\u2019s \u2018end\u2019 (of modernity) here. Broad\nawareness of even the probability of climate change marks a moment\nTimothy Clark 133\nat which a historical epoch is discerned as such, in its closure, rendering\nits intellectual structures both newly perceptible and philosophically\nexhausted.4 The epoch whose closure is at issue is that in which\nthe finitude of the earth was ignored, discounted or forgotten. Its\nclosure entails a realisation of the surprising degree to which even\nthe most seemingly benign and trivial practices have operated on the\nfalse supposition of an infinite earth, an inexhaustible externality in\nboth space and time\u2014 that natural resources (air, water, soil, and\ntolerable weather) are free gifts; and, finally, that future time and the\nterrestrial space can act as bottomless repositories for waste or for issues\nthat thinking wishes to avoid. At the same time \u2018one does not leave\nthe epoch whose closure one can outline\u2019 (12), and there is sense,\nsimultaneously, of change and of entrapment.\nClimate change politics today is mostly the politics of closure in\nself-denial, most obviously so in the case of sometimes unscrupulous\nattempts to throw mud on the climatologic evidence. Environmental\nproblems implicate huge and relatively new questions of ethics,\npersonal identity, knowledge, social justice, animal rights, the claims\nof future generations, the value of the nonhuman, and the limits\nof classical economics, etc., yet they have now been overwhelmingly\nco-opted as primarily questions of better management. Over the past\ntwenty years a process of \u2018ecological modernisation\u2019 has sought to\nnormalise and internalise environmental issues into the workings of\nindustrial capitalism by making them issues of improved efficiency\nand distribution. Environmental politics becomes recast as merely a\ndebate about measures such as pollution credits, carbon offset schemes,\nimproved energy efficiency and the supposed benefits of a greener\nconsumerism. To try to manage the planet\u2019s atmosphere\u2014 a boundary\ncondition for life\u2014by making it part of a carbon trading offset\nscheme or of some kind of market looks like a peculiar variant of the\nancient fantasy of establishing some self-moving system of rationality\nthat can be master of its own conditions. A dangerous fantasy of\nthis kind is also arguably built into the basic mechanisms of liberal\ndemocracy conceived as an institution for the procedurally neutral\nrepresentation of competing interests, for this means in practice pitting\nthe environment as someone\u2019s \u2018interest\u2019 to be gauged in competition\nwith other \u2018interests\u2019. These is a general evasion of the contradiction\nbetween a viable environmental ethics and the basic tenets and\n134 Oxford Literary Review\noperations of liberal, consumer democracy and industrial capitalism,\ntheir demand for endless capital accumulation (\u2018growth\u2019).\n\u2018Closure\u2019 is here suggested in a sense supplementing Derrida\u2019s\narguments about the \u2018closure of metaphysics\u2019, not as simply corres-\nponding to or instantiating them. Derrida\u2019s readings trace in numerous\ntexts and contexts how a drive towards totality, purity or unity both\nneeds and denies conditions of contingency, otherness and difference,\nyet his readings do not address the material finitude of the planet\nas itself an encompassing site of deconstructive effects. For Derrida,\nthe included-as-excluded may manifest itself in logical incoherencies,\nsemantic and conceptual slippages etc. of a text or system of thought:\nto these may surely now be added the event of a pervasive, impersonal\ncontestation of innumerable modes of thought, systems of production,\nplanning and government\u2014of numerous human \u201cconstructions\u201d of\nthe world (literally as well as figuratively)\u2014newly highlighted as\ninscribed in material contexts and systems which they only imagined\nthey could command or incorporate. \u2018Isn\u2019t there an element excluded\nfrom the system that assures the system\u2019s space of possibility?\u2019 (Glas).5\nA geographical and geological contingency, the finitude of the earth,\nnow compels us to trace the anthropocentric enclosure of inherited\nmodes of thinking and practice. The enlightenment project to render\nall the elements of nature part of a calculable technics is made\nto face its own dysfunction in the agency of what had previously\nbeen excluded from reckoning, or, more precisely, in that which had\nalways been included-as-excluded. The condition of closure renders\nanachronistic inherited economic, political practices and modes of\njudgement without acceptable alternatives appearing in their place. The\nepoch whose intellectual closure is now visible, the \u2018flat earth\u2019 epoch so\nto speak, inaugurates the need to think a bounded space in which the\nconsequences of actions may mutate to come back unexpectedly from\nthe other side of the planet. The \u2018environment\u2019 is no longer thinkable as\nan object of \u2018crisis\u2019 for us to decide on or manage:6 it ceases being only\na passive ground, context and resource for human society and becomes\nan imponderable agency that must somehow be taken into account,\neven if we are unsure how.\n\u2018Deconstruction is what is happening\u2019\u2014 this is Derrida in 2002,\nlisting various contemporary disruptions and dislocations in the human\nworld, \u2018crises, wars, phenomena of so-called national and international\nTimothy Clark 135\nterrorism, massacres that are declared or not, the transformation of the\nglobal market and of international law\u2019. Again no reference is made\nto environmental\/material issues or dangers. Derrida\u2019s list remains\nan anthropocentric and limited account of \u2018the rhythm of what is\nhappening in the world\u2019.7 This characterisation of \u2018deconstruction\u2019\nexcludes effects of non-human agency. The thought of climate change\nmeans that, once again, we seem suddenly in need of confronting how\ncurrent modes of thinking and acting are inadequate or anachronistic.\nIn Derrida, the falsely circumscribed context of deconstruction\u2019s\nhappening enables a far more manageable (if already \u2018impossible\u2019)\nconception of what the political sphere is and the agencies that inhabit\nit. Against this, the closure of epoch associated with recognition of the\nfinitude of the earth opens up or renders unignorable a new front of\ndeconstructive effects.\nDerrida\u2019s foreclosure may become apparent in one way in which the\ndeconstructive agency of the earth\u2014using this singular term for an\nincalculable material multiplicity\u2014now \u2018manifests\u2019 itself in so-called\nscale effects. The reasons for the scare quotes around \u2018manifest\u2019 will\nbecome apparent. Scale effects are straightforward to exemplify but\nimpossible to apprehend in any particular individual case: what is\ninsignificant or trivial for an individual, say driving a car, regarded\nby some even as a right, becomes a matter of social concern when\nthousands and millions of people do it and at even larger scales it\nbecomes a threat to the integrity of the environment itself. Numerous\nacts of individual unimportance or insignificance mutate into an\nimpersonal geological force. It is a matter of context, familiarly perhaps,\nbut here less in the sense that the context determining an individual\naction cannot be bounded (\u2018no context admitting of being closed\u2019 etc),\nbut, as the scale changes, of one action metamorphosing into another\none, and the trivial into the disastrous. Whatever one may think of \u2018the\nAmerican of life\u2019, it would be of little consequence if it concerned only\na few thousand or a few million people living at such cost. Extended to\nthe hundred of millions, however, it now becomes newly perceived as\na dangerous assault upon the global commons.\nOne difficulty is that, considered within the terms of current liberal\ndemocracy, its remit bounded by national frontiers and conceptions\nof state sovereignty, legitimated as a defence of individual right and\nblind to scale effects, the global violence of \u2018the American way of\n136 Oxford Literary Review\nlife\u2019 becomes invisible. Climate change thus raises at a different pitch\nthe argument that environmental issues resist and question the bases\nand assumptions of the liberal tradition in political thought,8 i.e. that\ntradition which conceives the state primarily as a means to secure\nthe maximum autonomy of individuals within it on an egalitarian\nbasis.\nScale effects impose unprecedented difficulties of interpretation and\nimagination which seem to exceed anything envisaged by Derrida:\nof conceiving that even trivial personal decisions about food, ways\nof travelling to work, gardening etc. all become significant or not\ndepending on the contingency of how many others have done, are\ndoing or will do them, anywhere on earth, implicating acts of seeming\nirrelevance in incalculable impacts. On top of this, to consider scale\neffects is also to multiply bewilderingly the number of things that\ncould\u2014conditionally\u2014be considered a significant \u2018environmental\nissue\u2019. A list might include: day to day assumptions about life style,\nthe voting trends of various countries, the fuel efficiency of modern cars\nand heating systems, population trends and sexual habits, definitions of\nthe good life, the nature of money and exchange, the aspirations of the\npoor, the politics of national sovereignty, the impersonal demands of\n\u2018advanced\u2019 infrastructures that imprison their inhabitants in a kind of\n\u2018energy slavery\u2019 (William Ophuls),9 the size of households, the melting\nthreshold of arctic tundra and the exact nature of innumerable other\nunknown or badly understood biological, meteorological and chemical\nprocesses, and so on. Each issue in itself is made more problematic by\nscale effects that render each of significance only in possible relation to\nthe others together, now, in the past and over an indefinite future.\nDerrida\u2019s political thinking concerns a \u2018negotiation\u2019 with conflicting\nor contradictory demands in relation to the legacies in which we\nfind ourselves, those that would determine an identity, that involve\nthe giving or refusing of consent to conventional or legal statutes\nor interpellations, or which relate to the borders and membership\nof a polis (e.g. democracy). Foreclosed, however, was consideration\nof innumerable happenings which are not conventionally decisions,\nrepresentations, or acts of refusal or welcome, the physical side effects\nof, say, travelling to a conference to put one\u2019s argument on these\nmatters, effects which, however tiny, may be immediately implicated\nin possible action-at-a-distance across the planet.\nTimothy Clark 137\nFor Derrida a decision \u2018worthy of the name\u2019 of decision is one\nmade when procedural or inherited guidance on an issue has been\nexhausted or breaks down and one risks the responsibility of a decision\noutside given protocols.10 Yet the aporia\u2014 if that is still the word\u2014\nto be negotiated in this case is not a lack of plausible measures that\nmight reduce pollution in specific instances (e.g. different transport\nsystems, altered fertilizer use, population controls, revised modes of\naccounting, a new anti-luxury ethic etc.) but that the global scale of\nthe issue, combined with scale effects and other uncertainties, derides\nthe significance of any one measure at any one place or time. Even\nas the global stakes become higher, the term \u2018decision\u2019 must become\ndiluted almost out of all recognition in relation to the kinds of daily\nbanality implicated in climate change. For any individual, the situation\nis simultaneously a generalisation, intensification and yet trivialisation\nof Derrida\u2019s notion of decision as a negotiation with the undecidable\u2014\nwhat is being decided when I turn on a light, buy a particular kind\nof pineapple, or fly to a conference? What could a decision \u2018worthy\nof the name\u2019 be in such a context? The very element that renders\nsome trivialities potentially disastrous in the longer term, the effects of\nscale, necessarily includes the almost complete irrelevance of my own\n\u2018decision\u2019 at the present time. Yet the less my share of the blame, the\ngreater the overall responsibility.\nClimate change seems a peculiarly monstrous cultural\/political\/\neconomic\/ philosophical\/ethical and scientific hybrid in Bruno\nLatour\u2019s sense.11 That is, the phrase works as a condensed cipher for\nthe destabilisation of such previously decisive dyads as nature\/culture,\nscience\/politics, fact\/value. Collapsing the broadest upon the smallest\nscale, merging the trivial and the catastrophic, its planetary scale\ncompels us to think and act as if already citizens of a world polity, even\nas it undermines the credibility of any such thing. \u2018Deconstruction\u2019\nin the sense identified with Derrida seems to undergo a new and\ninitially \u2018deranging\u2019 revision of its contexts, a variously disconcerting\nor exciting upping of the ante. With the thought of climate change,\ntopics that have been the focus of kinds of deconstructive reading or\ndebate over the decades\u2014 the closure of Western metaphysics, the\nethical claims of nonhuman life, the auto-immunity of democratic\ninstitutions, the limits of classical economic accounting, definitions of\nthe human, the conflict of the faculties, the concepts of borders and\n138 Oxford Literary Review\nboundaries, the nature of responsibility etc.\u2014 all now seem put into\nplay at the same time. Charles S. Brown writes that \u2018by defining our\nproblems as either economic or biological, political or philosophical,\nwe reproduce the structure of the academy, but fail to appreciate\nthe kind of essential interconnections that ecological thinking in\nparticular has emphasised.\u201912 Yet how to rethink next to everything at\nonce?\nThe second part of this paper traces deconstructive force of climate\nchange in relation to ecocriticism, the study of literature and the\nenvironment.\nClimate Change: the Closure of Ecocriticism?\nThat the closure of an epoch is not its end is a point familiar to\nreaders of Derrida\u2019s Of Grammatology (1967).13 It also sums up the\nquandary of world society after the farce of the 2009 UN conference\nat Copenhagen. A condition of closure in self-denial characterises\nthe way Western consumer democracies, especially in Europe, have\nnow moved beyond any substantive \u2018politics of sustainability.\u2019 Ingolfur\nBl\u00fchdorn and Ian Welsh argue that what now takes centre ground is\nrather \u2018the management of the inability and unwillingness to become\nsustainable.\u201914\nOne effect is the proliferation of a merely \u2018symbolic politics,\u2019\npolitical actions designed to appease and, effectively, to deceive\u2014\ndeceive, that is, a public that in many ways prefers to be deceived.\nJens Newig offers an analysis of the various modes of and reasons for\n\u2018symbolic legislation.\u2019 Of particular relevance here is the following:\nA socially relevant problem, for which at a given point of\ntime there is either no appropriate solution or only one that\nentails short-term costs exceeding the short-term benefits, is\nlikely to be dealt with through symbolic legislation.15\nThe underlying rationale is not to deal with a problem, but to\nmanage the inability or unwillingness to deal with it. Newig refers to\na piece of symbolic legislation in Germany in 1995, the Ozongesetz\nor summer smog act, a ban on high emissions from cars that was\nwidely supported yet quite useless in practice because of the various\nconditions, thresholds and exceptions built into it. While many\nTimothy Clark 139\nmotorists supported the ban, few in actuality even respected the\ntemporary speed limits it introduced. In effect, the ban papered over\nfundamental conflicts in those that supported it, between concerns for\npublic health and the freedom of motorists:\nBy symbolically integrating incompatible interests held by\nthe same individual, the Ozongestz successfully attended\nto a psychological division within rather than between\nindividuals. It thus displays qualities of a tool of individual\nas well as societal self-deception.16\nPut another way, \u2018we may glimpse the closure. I do not say the end.\u201917\nHow far is even the fast emerging critical school of ecocriticism\ndescribable in terms of a condition of closure in self-denial? There is,\nfirst of all, one striking fact to consider: that while climate change\nis prominent in contemporary environmental writing and science\nfiction, eco-criticism itself rarely directly addresses the topic in its\ninterpretations of literature and culture. It is mostly at issue only\nobliquely or implicitly. To work through various extant anthologies\nof ecocriticism is to draw a striking absence of work on climate\nchange. The only academic article directly on the topic of climate\nchange ever to appear in the leading ecocritical journal Interdisciplinary\nStudies in Literature and the Environment is disarmingly direct about\nits intellectual helplessness. Ken Hiltner compares the contemporary\nchallenge to that of air-pollution in early modern London, and how\nJohn Evelyn misleadingly scapegoated brewers and dyers for a problem\ncaused by the general population:\nperhaps the most important lesson to be learned from\n[Evelyn\u2019s] Fumifugium is that, when confronted with the\nchallenge of representing what neither reader not writer may\nwish to acknowledge about their shared practices, the causes\nof the environmental crisis may be misrepresented, though\nperhaps unintentionally. . . it is a real danger brought about\nby the challenge of representing a problem that nearly\neveryone is causing, but that people are hesitant to confront\nbecause they are unable to stop contributing to it.18\n140 Oxford Literary Review\nClimate change and global warming do not appear in the index of\nLawrence Buell\u2019s The Future of Environmental Criticism (2004).\nBuell writes there:\nEnvironmental criticism in literary studies has, thus far,\nnot changed literary studies or environmental humanities\nso much as it has been increasingly absorbed therein. . . . its\ndurability so far rests on its having introduced a fresh topic\nor perspective or archive rather than in distinctive methods\nof inquiry.19\nThis seems disappointing and even surprising, given how deeply the\nenvironmental \u2018crisis\u2019 might seem to question the inherited order.\nOne factor might be the domination of political and intellectual life\nby modes of legitimation that appeal to the would-be \u2018progressive\u2019\nliberal tradition. Richard Kerridge highlights this as posing a particular\nchallenge for eocriticism:\nunlike feminism, with which it otherwise has points\nin common, environmentalism has difficulty in being a\npolitics of personal liberation or social mobility . . . environ-\nmentalism has a political weakness in comparison with\nfeminism: it is much harder for environmentalists to make\nthe connection between global threats and individual lives.20\nNevertheless, a vast body of ecocriticism reads as an attempt to address\nenvironmental questions by linking itself to this usually individualistic\ndiscourse of legitimation, however compromised it might be by also\nserving as the ideological glue of market democracy, with its deceptive\nhyping of individual \u2018choice\u2019.21 A lot of environmental criticism\nbecomes in danger of comprising a symbolic cultural politics,\nanalogous to that green consumerism which depicts the causes of\nenvironmental danger \u2018as a series of bad household and\/or personal\nbuying decisions\u2019 (Timothy W. Luke)?22 This is not just to make\nthe crude point that most Western ecocritics inhabit a lifestyle that\nstands at best in a strained relation to their professed politics, that they\ndrive cars, fly to international conferences, and work in an education\nsystem dedicated to enhancing the \u2018competitiveness\u2019 of their nation\nstates etc. The deeper issue may be the methodological liberalism\nTimothy Clark 141\nof their thinking, for, like green consumerism, much ecocriticism\ntakes the individual attitude as its starting point and then argues\nfor a change in the choices which that individual makes. Thus, it is\nhoped, the growth of an \u2018ecological awareness\u2019 through the study of\nenvironmentalist non-fiction, eco-poetry or real ventures into the wild,\nwill be somehow sufficient to produce an ecologically viable society.\nSuch thinking effectively recognises that climate change enacts a drastic\nreconfiguration of given distinctions of public and private but, without\nmore sustained work on the nature of the state, ideology, modes of\nproduction etc, still seeks to engage it solely in terms of individual\nattitude and choice. The focus on the individual, whether as green\nconsumer, a reader of an ecocritical argument, or as a backpacker,\nreinforces the illusion that reality and power remain a matter of\nindividuals pursuing their rights and opinions (\u2018do you buy climate\nchange?\u2019).\nAnother result is that green attitudes so easily recoil into a kind of\npersonal moralism:\nthe search for new ethical and political traditions . . . tends\nto reduce questions of environmental ethics to issues of\npersonal conscience. . . it appears that concern for political\nreform almost falls away altogether in the search for an\nappropriate individual consciousness and lifestyle. . . 23 (Bob\nPepperman Taylor)\nThis can be called a symbolic politics insofar its unreality and political\nnaivety enable those who advocate it to demand changes they both\nwant and do not want.\nOther ecocritical arguments are more sophisticated than the stance\nof calling for changes in attitude. The issue of climate change, however,\ndoes seem to present something so close to paralysing that even more\nintellectually and politically astute kinds of environmental criticism\nand politics seem to have become what Bl\u00fchdorn calls \u2018simulative\npolitics,\u2019 a far more troubling concept than \u2018symbolic politics:\u2019\nThe theory of simulative politics replaces the negative,\ndefeatist\u2014 and very modernist\u2014 concept of politics as\na farce with the much more positive notion of politics\nas simulation. It acknowledges, firstly, that in advanced\n142 Oxford Literary Review\nmodern societies comprehensive political ideologies\u2014\nincluding ecologism\u2014are increasingly irrelevant, and\nsecondly, that the capacities of politics, i.e. of democratic\nnegotiation, decision and control, has become increasingly\nrestricted.24\nA simulative politics is what emerges when it is no longer possible\nto oppose a merely \u2018symbolic\u2019 politics with an supposedly genuine\nor acceptable one. Simulative politics is the pseudo politics of the\ncondition of intellectual closure. In relation to the specific issue\nof ecocriticism and climate change one could re-inflect \u2018simulative\npolitics\u2019 to name arguments that perform an involuntary anachronism:\ninadequate, partial or insufficient readings offered in a context in\nwhich acceptable alternatives seem not yet conceivable. This is to re-\nenact the condition of closure. To describe ecocriticism as engaged\nin a simulative politics in this context is not to deny that individual\nreadings\u2014of representations of the nonhuman, environmental racism\nor of bioregional ideals etc\u2014 are often valuable and desirable, like\nefforts to preserve ecosystems or reform energy infrastructures, but\nonly to acknowledge the inadequacy of their scope in relation to\nnational and global contexts whose practices so overwhelmingly negate\nthem.\nAt the moment it seems still the more practicable gesture to turn\nback on inherited modes of thought in view of their closure, their\nstrategies of evasion or containment. To draw a fuller map of the cul\nde sac we are in may also be one step towards escaping the longer-term\nthreats, not only of environmental degradation, but also that of eco-\nfascism.\nStrategies of evasion and containment\n1. Scale Framing. Environmental or eco-criticism evolved in the\ntradition of romantic humanism primarily to address local and easily\nidentifiable outrages and injustices, the destruction of wilderness, the\neffects of aggressive systems of agriculture on a bioregion and its\ninhabitants, etc. . . Climate change thus challenges some green critics\nwith the fact that while they have been inventing ways to think and\nact in relation to their national cultures and histories, they seem\u2014 like\nTimothy Clark 143\nalmost everyone else\u2014 still a long way short of thinking in the way and\non the scale demanded by an issue both so global and multiplicitous.\nHabitual modes of thought, interpretation and action may emerge\nnow as constituted by a kind of now anachronistic \u2018scale framing.\u2019\nHilda E. Kurtz writes: \u2018Scale frames are the discursive practices that\nconstruct meaningful (and actionable) linkages between the scale at\nwhich a social problem is experienced and the scale(s) at which it could\nbe politically resolved.\u201925 To this should be added the additional point\nthat to frame the scale at which one thinks a problem is also sometimes\na way of evading it\u2014 e.g. thinking of private vehicle use solely in\nterms of individual right.26 An eco-critic going through the familiar\nmoves of praising Wendell Berry or Jane Brox as writers engaged\nwith an ethics of non-exploitative local dwelling and conceptions of\npersonal identity sensitive to requirements of other species, is, perhaps\nnecessarily, blocking off simultaneous consideration of how such work\nis effectively nullified by the effects of atmospheric emissions on\nthe other side of the world, including even by numerous charcoal\nfires from the poor in India and the far east. As Emma Hughes\nwrites of another example of scale framing in relation to GM crops\nin Britain, \u2018by giving people a boundary you are installing a sense\nof agency or control; a discursive reconstruction of certainty is\nprovided.\u201927\nScale framing is a major issue in literary depictions of climate\nchange. The time scales at issue may challenge forms of narrative geared\nto an easily identifiable section of lived human time. Kim Stanley\nRobinson\u2019s climate change trilogy, Forty Signs of Rain (2004), Fifty\nDegrees Below (2005) and Sixty Days and Counting (2007),28 deals with\nthe issues of representation by depicting specific extreme weather events\nin Washington DC as they impinge upon the personal, professional\nand political lives of selected scientists and politicians. In other words,\nthe daunting scale and elusive agency of the issue is framed by a focus,\nat the human scale, on moments of seeming policy decisions among\nsome people addressing the question of what is happening and what to\ndo. Such framing risks the bizarre effect that climate change is some\nsort of misadministration, to be exposed, addressed\u2014or evaded\u2014\nby the characters whose social conscience and morality is thereby put\nto the test. It is in danger of becoming a disaster-as-test-of-character\nscenario, a US-centric fantasy affirming familiar \u2018human\u2019 values.\n144 Oxford Literary Review\nUrsula K. Heise writes, attacking the fixation in environmental\npolitics on the supposedly restorative function of the \u2018local\u2019:\nLike other processes of global systemic transformation,\nclimate change poses a challenge for narrative and lyrical\nforms that have conventionally focused above all on\nindividual, families, or nations, since it requires the\narticulation of connections between events at vastly different\nscales. . . . task of such magnitude that few writers and\nfilmmakers have attempted it so far.29\nLiterary texts or films have tended to fall back on the tired formulae\nof urban disasters and apocalyptic scenarios (an impersonal variety\nof the alien invasion), often with simplistic characterisation and an\nevasively black and white morality involving conspiracy theories, evil\nindustrialists, maverick scientists or\u2014 like the film The Day After\nTomorrow\u2014with plots that turn on acts of individual decision or\nheroism that reinforce a culture of narcissistic individualism already\nimplicated in consumer democracy and environmental danger.30\nWith its multiple scales, more or less invisibility, global scope,\nunpredictability and alarming menace, climate change seems more\ngermane to modes of representation that involve unfamiliar non\nhuman agencies, multiple and perhaps elliptical plots. The situation\ninvites a writing that might be a form of secularised magic realism,\nin which seemingly rational procedures and modes of thought and\nrepresentation interact with bizarre and counter-intuitive non-human\nagencies, kinds of action-at-a-distance, with plural conventions of\ncharacterisation, symbolisation and plotting. Heise suggests David\nBrin\u2019s Earth (1991)31 as an instance of the kind of structures of literary\nrepresentation that might be adequate to global environmental dangers\nand quandaries.32 It does not actually concern climate change per se but\noffers a science fiction plot of global disaster (the earth being consumed\nby a black hole from within) conveyed through a multiplication of\nfragmented narrative viewpoints and through various generic modes\u2014\nmyth, epic and allegory\u2014 techniques that is, previously associated with\nthe urban novel of literary modernism (James Joyce, John Dos Passos).\n(2) Multi-disciplinarity. If criticism and politics seem unable to\nconfront climate change it is perhaps because there is no simple or\nTimothy Clark 145\nunitary object directly to confront or delimit, let alone to \u2018fix\u2019 as such.\nThere is no \u2018it\u2019, only a kind of dissolve into innumerable issues. So it\nmay be that ecocriticism has been unable to deal with climate change\nas a sustained and direct object of analysis because the issue is one that\nrefuses to stay put, dispersing as soon as you look at to it into multiple\nquestions, disciplines and topics, most of them at once outside the\nsphere of literary studies, others outside the humanities altogether, and\nmany of them (e.g. family size,) only counting as \u2018environmental\u2019 at all\nthrough variously hypothetical contextual and scale effects. In effect,\ncoming into contact with the issues of climate change, ecocriticism\nconsidered as a distinct field or practice or reading may be as likely\nto dissolve as a cube of sugar in warm water.\n(3) The outmoded quest for a \u2018liberatory\u2019 method. Environmental\nquestions are plural, cross-disciplinary, contentious and often\nmutually contradictory. The defining terms \u2018environment\u2019 or\n\u2018environmentalism\u2019 seem less coherent concepts than loose containers\nfor all kinds of issues that do not fit given modes of politics. It is perhaps\nnot surprising then that the desire for some intellectual certainty in\ntheir stance has led to many ecocritics reaching for familiar modernist\ncategories. Greg Garrard describes the general stance of twenty-first\necocriticism as tending towards \u2018social ecology,\u201933 that is, towards\narguments that human violence against the natural world is ultimately\na product of oppressive structures of hierarchy in the human species.34\nIn effect, environmental issues can be held to be addressed by engaging\nquestions of equity among human beings. Thus it is today that, while\nsome environmental thinkers confront directly the difficult question\nof clashes between specific environmental issues and the ideals and\nnorms of inherited thought (e.g. in liberalism), the majority of eco-\ncritical arguments now draw primarily on models of thinking taken\nfrom oppositional politics in the modern, progressive\/enlightenment\ntradition. This general stance has been accompanied with an increased\nattention to questions of environmental justice, \u2018the right of all people\nto share equally in the benefits bestowed by a healthy environment,\u201935\nraising such important issues as environmental racism, the elitism of\nthe mainstream environmental politics, and environmental health as a\nmatter of social justice.\nThe environmental justice movement invokes visions of a just\nsociety linked in part to the impetus of American civil rights\n146 Oxford Literary Review\nstruggle. Picking up this agenda in the late 1990s, ecocriticism gained\nrhetorical appeal by seeming to extend the terms of that movement\nto environmental concerns. Mapping environmental politics onto the\nmore familiar human justice agenda has also had some short term\nintellectual advantages: critics can also bring to bear all the well-used\ntools of mainstream cultural criticism, following its familiar method\nof focusing on competing social \u2018constructions\u2019 of an issue in terms\nof various interests and exclusions. A distinction of green criticism\nbecomes simply that it is competing constructions of the environment\nthat are being gauged. Ecocriticism thus rebutted earlier accusations of\na romantic anti-intellectualism and of the sacralisation of \u2018wilderness\u2019\nto gain more immediate political relevance, at least in relation to\nspecifically human, local grievances.\nClimate change, however, may mark the closure or exhaustion of\nmodes of environmental politics embedded in the modernist, liberal\ntradition. Val Plumwood writes that \u2018the green movement still lacks\na coherent liberatory theory,\u201936 but the blockage may be perhaps to\nposit such a simplistic theoretical goal in the first place. As a possible\nglobal catastrophe arising from innumerable mostly trivial or innocent\nindividual actions, including some which seem politically taboo, such\nas increased material prosperity, an expanding population or increased\nlongevity, climate change does not present any one easily identifiable\nantagonist. Its causes are diffuse, partly unpredictable and separated\nfrom their effects by huge gaps in space and time. Climate change\nentangles itself with other environmental problems that seem to present\nno acceptable solution\u2014 the demands, for instance, of an expanding\npopulation for new and safely inhabitable space as against the claims\nto preservation of the habitats of increasingly scarce animals or plants.\nCan western eco-critics comfortably inhabit a stance from which to\nengage the environmental degradation latent in the hopes of millions\nof people in the Far East planning to buy a first car? James Garvey\nwrites: \u2018In a more than token sense, a campaign of civic disobedience\nundertaken for meaningful action on climate change is nothing other\nthan campaign by us, against us.\u201937\nAnother danger is that the tendency to voice environmental justice\nin the usual terms of a demand for equitable \u2018inclusion\u2019 is effectively to\nlegitimise the centre from which people claim to be excluded, i.e. not\nto offer an alternative account of the social good but only to second\nTimothy Clark 147\ndemands for a fairer distribution of the spoils (\u2018the right of all people\nto share equally in the benefits bestowed by a healthy environment\u2019).\nWhatever its strength in addressing local grievances, eco-criticism thus\nbecomes the covert legitimation of consumer democracy.\nIn sum, in relation to climate change ecocriticism, for all its\nemerging promise, remains a simulative politics, a mode of closure\nin self-denial. As a deconstructive force, intellectually inspiring despite\nits horror, climate change still works to resist and open up the deep\nassumptions, pious enclosures and disciplinary parochialisms of current\nintellectual life, even as its pervasive irony mocks the destructive\ncomplacencies of consumer democracy, trapped as it is in \u2018the evident\ncontradiction between late modern society\u2019s acknowledgment that\nradical and effective change is urgent and inescapable and its adamant\nresolve to sustain what is known to be unsustainable\u2019 (Bl\u00fchdorn).38\nFor criticism, there seems no off-the shelf oppositional stance ready\nto be used or adapted, only a great deal of new work to be\ndone.\nNotes\n1 \u2018Deconstruction and Ethics\u2019, in Deconstructions: A User\u2019s Guide, edited by Nicholas\nRoyle (Palgrave, 2000), 64\u201382, 77.\n2 For one approach see Tom Cohen\u2019s paper in this issue of OLR.\n3 Postmodern Climate Change (New York: Routledge, 2006), 3.\n4 For an overview see Simon Critchley, The Ethics of Deconstruction: Derrida and\nLevinas, 2nd ed.
