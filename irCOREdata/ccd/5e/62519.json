In the first method, height \nchange and volume change between 1991 and 2000 were estimated from the mean L-band \nstand backscatter difference between the two dates. Height change and volume change over \nthe nine year period were estimated with an accuracy of 0.23m and 15m3\/ha respectively, \nwhen the stands were below saturation point for the first date. The accuracy of the results \nwas lower for stands beyond saturation in both data sets. In the second method, height \nchange is calculated from estimated stand height in 2000 minus estimated stand height in \n1991. The second method produced poorer results than the first method, but better results \nthan predicted by the error propagation equation. The difference between the observed \naccuracy and the expected error (based on the error propagation equation) appears to be due \nto a systematic bias in both the 1991 and 2000 estimates, as the residuals are correlated  for \nstands below 20 years old (r=0.71 for stand volume residuals). The third experiment \ninvestigates the utility of data from two dates to classify the stands into three age classes. \nThe results show that, with two images separated by nine years, 85% of stands were \ncorrectly classified compared to 69% for a single date L-HV image.  \n \nKeywords: AirSAR; E-SAR; Thetford forest; change detection; forest; timber volume; \ncanopy height \n \n1. Introduction \nTerrestrial biotic carbon stores are a key element to understanding climate change, although \nthey are difficult to assess and current estimates have high uncertainties attached (Gupta et \nal., 2003).  Radar remote sensing is one of a range of remote sensing technologies, which \npotentially has a role to play in reducing the uncertainty in monitoring and mapping forest \nchange and growth. Radar remote sensing studies have tended to focus on single date \nimagery and investigating the sensitivity of radar backscatter to biomass and related \nbiophysical variables (Dobson et al., 1992; Le Toan et al., 1992; Ranson & Sun, 1994; \nHarrell et al., 1995; Harrell et al., 1997). The uptake of multi-temporal SAR remote sensing \nfor forest change has been limited by the availability of suitable archives of SAR imagery \nand the biomass-dependent saturation of the SAR signal, which becomes especially \nlimiting if only one band (a single polarisation at a single wavelength) is available. \nSaturation point is the point at which increases in forest biomass, height or volume \nno longer cause a detectable change in observed backscatter. The backscatter response from \nforest is highly wavelength and polarization dependent. Shorter wavelength X-band (~3 \ncm) and C-band (~5 cm) signals are scattered from the smaller sized components of the \nforest canopy, usually from leaves and twigs, so have limited interaction with the tree \ntrunk. Given that the tree trunk generally accounts for 75% of the aboveground biomass for \nCorsican pine (Pinus nigra) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in the UK (Levy et al., 2004) \nshorter wavelengths are of limited use in estimating aboveground biomass (Imhoff, 1995a). \nLonger wavelengths such as L-band (~23cm) and P-band (~68cm) penetrate further through \nthe canopy and typically interact with branches or tree trunks providing a better source for \nestimating forest biomass. One consequence of wavelength dependent scattering \ninteractions is that saturation is wavelength dependent. The C-band typically saturates at \naround 20t\/ha, the L-band at around 40 to 100 t\/ha and P-band at around 100 to 200t\/ha \n(Dobson et al., 1992; Imhoff, 1995b). However, the saturation point is very dependent upon \nforest structure and for deciduous canopies biomass values of 40kg\/m2 (equivalent to \n400t\/ha) without reaching saturation point have been reported (Ferrazzoli et al., 1997). An \nalternative method of extending the saturation point to higher biomass levels is via Very \nHigh Frequency (VHF) airborne data sets which have shown no signs of saturating at \nbiomass levels of 375t\/ha for Norway spruce and Scots pine forest (Fransson et al., 2000). \nDifferent polarisations vary in their sensitivity to biomass, with cross-polarised signals \ntending to be most sensitive (Kasischke et al., 1997). \nA number of approaches have been proposed which extend the range for which \naccurate estimates can be made beyond the saturation point. The methods all use more \ninput data than just a single wavelength and polarisation. For example, multi-frequency \ndata can be used through multivariate relationships or multi-frequency ratios (e.g. Ranson \n& Sun, 1994; Ranson et al., 1995; Harrell et al,. 1997), alternatively additional information \nsuch as forest structural type classifications (Dobson et al., 1995; Kasischke et al., 1995; \nHarrel et al., 1997) can be incorporated, typically in multi-stage approach.    \nMulti-temporal radar work has tended to focus mainly on using multi-date imagery \nto characterise more accurately forest state for a limited period of time, either via \nclassification based studies using temporal backscatter profiles to discriminate between \ncover types (Conway, 1997; Van de Griend & Seyhan, 1999; Miles et al., 2003), to \noptimise estimates of backscatter (Quegan et al., 2000) or to determine the optimum time of \nyear, or weather conditions,  for estimating biophysical variables from backscatter (Wang et \nal., 1994; Harrell et al., 1995; Ranson et al., 1995; Harrell et al., 1997;  Fransson & \nIsraelsson, 1999; Kurvonen et al., 1999; Pullianien et al., 2003) or coherence (Fransson et \nal., 2001). Multi-temporal backscatter has been used to investigate boreal forest \ndisturbances, including logging, insect damage and fire damage (Ranson et al., 2003). \nLogging activities have also been successfully detected using multi-temporal coherence \n(Smith & Askne, 2001). L-HH backscatter change has been used to estimate forest growth \nbetween 1978 and 1997 using SEASAT and JERS-1 L-HH backscatter (Balzter et al., \n2003). \nThe potential for multi-temporal L-band remote sensing of forests will increase as \nALOS-PALSAR, SAOCOM-1 and TerraSAR-L become operational and complement \nexisting JERS-1 and SIRC data archives. Timing of data acquisition is important, because if \nthe period between the two data acquisitions is too short, then too little growth will have \noccurred to be detectable above measurement error.  Conversely, if the period is too long \nthen stands will reach saturation level, which we expect to limit the utility of multi-\ntemporal monitoring. This paper presents an investigation of the utility of airborne multi-\ntemporal SAR for monitoring forest growth, specifically stand height and volume change. \nThe results of three methods of monitoring forest change over a 9 year period are reported.  \n  \n2. Data and Methods \n2.1 Field site \nThe study area is Thetford Forest, which lies over the Suffolk-Norfolk border in East \nAnglia, UK and is a relatively flat lowland forest. Thetford Forest is a Forestry \nCommission (FC) owned site and is managed primarily for timber production, as a \nconsequence stands are mono-species and mono-age. Most of the stands are Corsican or \nScots pine planted during the last 80 years. The analysis in this paper is limited to Corsican \npine, as the Scots pine age distribution is uneven (very young or old stands, with few stands \nbetween the two extremes).  \nAt Thetford, Corsican pine tree numbers vary from 2000-3000 trees\/ha for young, \nunthinned stands down to 200 trees\/ha for mature stands. This corresponds to a maximum \ntimber volume of around 650m3\/ha and a maximum height of 32m. Between 1991 and \n2000, the period of interest, the range of tree height change (growth) was from 1.5m for \nmature stands to 5.7m for young stands, with volume changing by 40m3\/ha for young \nstands to a maximum of 130 m3\/ha for stands 20-40 years old (equivalent to the middle \nstage of the plantation stand\u2019s lifecycle).  \n \n2.2 Forestry data \nThe species, age and yield class of each stand are known and specified in a GIS database \ndeveloped and maintained by the FC. Yield class is essentially a measure of expected \nvegetation growth rate that allows timber yield models to be tailored to fit the \nenvironmental conditions of specific stands. The Corsican pine stands at Thetford are in \nyield classes 12, 14, 16 and 18, although the majority are class 14. From the information \nprovided by the FC GIS it is possible to use forest yield models (Edwards & Christie, 1981) \nto determine the expected timber volume and stand top height at a given age, based on \nknowledge of the species and yield class. Timber volume is defined as the trunk volume, \nexcluding bark and also branches, and for the Corsican pine stands at Thetford is strongly \ncorrelated with tree height (r2=0.99 when fitted with a second order polynomial).  \nThe FC yield models provide model estimates from 5 years prior to the first \nthinning event and onwards. The time of this first thinning varies slightly depending on \nyield class and species, but the FC yield curves relevant to this study start at between 15-20 \nyears, so it was necessary to extrapolate the yield curves to get estimates of tree height and \nvolume for stands below this point. Field measurements made in June 2000 at 24 stands \n(Skinner, 2002) enable us to test how accurately the fit is between the measured data and; i) \nthe extrapolated sections of the yield curves, ii) the interpolated sections of the yield curves, \nand iii) all 24 stands (interpolated and extrapolated stands combined) (table 1). \nThe RMSE between the field measured height data and the extrapolated yield curve \nstands is 0.99m (based on 14 stands covering a height range of 1.8 \u2013 9.5m), compared to \n1.06m for the interpolated stands (based on 10 stands with a height range of 10.0-30.0m) \n(table 1). This produces a stand height RMSE for all 24 stands of 1.02m (table 1). Field \ntimber volume estimates for Thetford, using FC stocking levels (Edwards & Christie, 1981) \nand field measurements of diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height, were also \ncompared to the estimates predicted by the FC yield models. The RMSE for all 24 stands \nwas 34.63m3\/ha (r2=0.95) for stand timber volumes from 6-600m3\/ha. The RMSE between \nthe field data estimates and the extrapolated values of timber volume is 26.28 m3\/ha  and \n45.25m3\/ha  for the interpolated FC yield model stands and the field measurement-derived \nestimates.  \nThe RMSE values in table 1 are higher for the extrapolated stands than for the \ninterpolated stands, because the height and volume values are higher for the interpolated \nstands. Overall, the similarity between the FC data and the ground data is high suggesting \nthat the FC GIS data and yield models (both extrapolated and interpolated) can be used as a \nproxy for ground data.  \n \n2.3 Airborne SAR data \nAirborne repeat-pass L-band fully polarimetric Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar \n(InSAR) data, in wide-swath mode, were acquired over Thetford forest on 31st May 2000 \nby the E-SAR sensor. The E-SAR data were collected as part of the SAR and Hyperspectral \nAirborne Campaign (SHAC) and revisited the area imaged by AirSAR in July 1991 during \nthe Maestro campaign (table 2) (Baker & Mitchell, 1992). The two data sets covered a \ncommon area of 8km x 5km and the E-SAR flight-line ran parallel to the AirSAR flightline \nproviding similar incidence angles for the AirSAR and E-SAR images to enable \ncomparison. The AirSAR and E-SAR data were geocoded and the backscatter coefficient, \n\u03c30 (dB), was calculated.  \nThe E-SAR sensor is operated by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) and was \nflown on a Dornier D0228 aircraft. The NASA\/JPL airborne SAR (AirSAR) is, like E-\nSAR, a fully polarimetric sensor. Both sensors have L-band SAR operating at 1.25 GHz \n(Horn 1996; Lou et al., 1996). AirSAR flies at a nominal altitude of 8000m and a speed of \n420 knots (Lou et al., 1996), so is less affected by turbulence than the E-SAR sensor which \nflew the Thetford site at just over 3000m and a velocity of 88m\/s (171 knots). To counter \nthe turbulence encountered at E-SAR\u2019s relatively low altitude and airspeed accurate motion \ncompensation is required (Horn, 1996). E-SAR data is absolutely calibrated and regular \ncalibration flights are conducted (Horn, 1996). AirSAR\u2019s calibration is maintained by \ncollecting test data on each flight day and by collecting calibration data at the start of each \ndata take (van Zyl, 1992). E-SAR\u2019s absolute radiometric calibration is typically \u2264 3dB and \n\u2264 1dB relative calibration (DLR, 2007). AirSAR\u2019s absolute calibration is also generally \u2264 \n3dB, whilst relative accuracy is \u2264 1.5dB between the 3 wavelengths and \u2264 0.5dB between \npolarisations (Lou et al., 1996). Phase calibration between HH and VV polarisations is \u2264 \n10\u00ba for both sensors (Lou et al., 1996; Horn, 1996). \nComparison of the E-SAR data with corner reflectors at the site gives approximate \ncalibration accuracies of 1.70dB for L-HH and 0.87dB for L-VV (Saich et al., 2003). \nCalibration of the 1991 AirSAR data, with corner reflectors, suggested the L-band data \nwere accurate to within 1dB (Luckman & Baker, 1994). The key difference between the \nAirSAR and E-SAR data sets is the flight altitude that results in higher spatial resolution \nand increased turbulence for the E-SAR sensor in comparison to the AirSAR sensor. \nPreliminary analysis of the relationships between E-SAR \u03c30 and timber volume and \nheight revealed a wide backscatter variance beyond saturation point, primarily due to the \ninfluence of incidence angle. The AirSAR data were also found to show a slight incidence \nangle effect of 0.045dB\/degree, compared to the E-SAR effect of 0.18dB\/degree (values \ncited are for L-HV). Consequently, a sensor-specific, polarisation-specific correction for \nincidence angle (Baker et al., 1994) was applied to the stands beyond saturation point. The \ncorrection was only applied to the stands beyond saturation point, because most of the \nstands at Thetford are beyond saturation point, so we could be confident of deriving a good \nempirical correction, whereas the number of stands below saturation point is more limited \nand they are unevenly distributed across the image. \nAn edge-eroded version of the FC polygons was used to create a mask to identify \nthe pixels to use when extracting mean stand values. Stands below 1ha after polygon \nerosion were excluded from analysis.  \nGiven the general relationship between L-band radar backscatter, for a single \npolarisation (e.g. L-HH or L-HV or L-VV), and stand height or volume we expect to \nidentify three main types of behaviour between the backscatter values in 1991 and 2000: \n\u2022 New growth - strong backscatter decrease (i.e. AirSAR backscatter higher than E-SAR) \ndue to the stand being clearcut and replanted between 1991 and 2000, so the trees are 0 \nto 9 years old in 2000. \n\u2022 Young growth - strong backscatter increase (i.e. E-SAR backscatter higher than \nAirSAR backscatter) due to the increase in biomass (stem and foliage) equivalent to \nthe 10-20 year stage of tree growth before the stand reaches densities where it causes \nthe radar signal to saturate.  \n\u2022 Mature stands \u2013 no change (or very low change) in backscatter as the stands have \nreached L-band saturation point. For the Thetford L-band data this corresponds \napproximately to trees 20 years or older. \nTable 3 shows the number of stands falling into each of these categories and the equivalent \nheight and volume ranges. \n2.4 Neural network method \nArtificial neural networks were used in the backscatter differencing and the height \/ volume \ndifferencing methods, to develop non-parametric, empirical relationships between \nbackscatter and the respective biophysical variable. Neural networks are subject to \novertraining, especially with limited data sets, and are effectively a 'black-box' model, \nproviding no understanding of the underlying physical or biophysical mechanisms. The \nadvantage in this case is that a preliminary study showed neural networks produced higher \naccuracy than standard multivariate statistical methods (Rowland et al., 2003) and neural \nnetworks can incorporate a range of input data sources, without needing a pre-defined form \nof multivariate relationship.  \nThe neural networks used in the experiments described in 2.5.1 and 2.5.2 were 1-\nhidden layer back-propagation networks trained with a Levenberg-Marquardt based \nlearning algorithm. Half the data (117 stands) were used to train the neural network, with \nthe other half used as an unseen test data set to assess the accuracy of the neural network. \nThe data were randomly divided to create the testing and training sets. 100 neural networks \nwere trained, for each suite of input and output parameters, with the best network (lowest \nRMSE) being chosen to produce the results. All r2 and RMSE values cited are for FC \npredicted values compared to neural network estimated values, where the networks are \napplied to the unseen test data set, not the training data set.  \n \n2.5 Experiments \nOur aim was to estimate forest change over a 9 year period from airborne SAR data. Two \nexperiments for quantifying forest growth (height and volume change), using neural \nnetwork derived empirical relationships, and one experiment into classifying forest age, \nwere conducted:  \n1) Backscatter differencing - estimation of growth from L-band backscatter difference \nbetween 1991 and 2000, using  L-band, as it is the only wavelength common to the \nAirSAR and E-SAR data acquisitions for Thetford. \n2) Height \/ Volume differencing - estimation of growth from the difference between E-\nSAR and AirSAR derived estimates of height and volume for 1991 and 2000. \n3)  Image thresholding - thresholding three images into age classes. Two of the images \nquantify change between 1991 and 2000, whilst the third is a single-date image (E-\nSAR L-HV image). The single-date image was thresholded to determine whether \nthe dual-date capability improved accuracy beyond that achievable with a single-\ndate acquisition only. \nStands that were clear-cut and replanted between 1991 and 2000 were only included in the \ndifference image method (experiment 3).  \n \n2.5.1 Backscatter differencing to estimate forest growth. The difference in mean stand \nL-HH, L-HV and L-VV backscatter, between the 1991 AirSAR data and 2000 E-SAR data, \nwas used to train a number of neural networks to estimate change in stand height and \nvolume for the young and mature age classes. The network structure was three L-band \ndifference values as input (L-HH, L-HV and L-VV), one hidden layer and one output value \n(height or volume change estimate). The results were validated against the expected height \nand volume change derived from the FC database in conjunction with the yield models. \n   \n2.5.2 Height \/ Volume differencing to estimate forest growth. This method involved \ngenerating height and volume estimates from both the 1991 AirSAR and 2000 E-SAR data \nand then calculating the difference between the 1991 and 2000 estimates. Previous work \nhad identified the most accurate neural network solutions, for the estimation of height and \nvolume in 1991 and 2000 from the AirSAR and E-SAR data (Rowland et al., 2003). The \nmost accurate AirSAR neural network identified used nine inputs, specifically standwise \nestimates of HH, VH, VV \u03c30 for the C-, L- and P-bands and produced either estimates of \nstand height or stand volume. The E-SAR neural networks had standwise estimates of L-\nHH, L-HV and L-VV backscatter, plus the interferometric coherence for the L-HH, L-HV \nand L-VV polarisations and again estimated either stand height or stand volume for the \nyoung and mature classes. The stands making up the testing and training data sets were kept \nconsistent for both the AirSAR and E-SAR data, allowing changes in height to be \ncalculated for a consistent set of test stands. The difference between the 1991 and 2000 \nheight estimates was then calculated and compared to the FC based estimates. Note the \nvolume of input data is higher in this experiment than for the preceding experiment, this \nwill be discussed in the results (section 3.2). \n \n2.5.3 E-SAR minus AirSAR difference image.  Two difference images were created by \nresampling the E-SAR L-HV image to the same spatial resolution as the AirSAR L-HV \nimage (table 2), then calculating the stand mean backscatter followed by:  \n\u03c30ratio = E-SAR \u03c30 \u2013 AirSAR \u03c30       (1) \n\u03c30diff = log10 (|E-SAR \u03c30lin \u2013 AirSAR \u03c30lin||)      (2) \nWhere \u03c30 ratio is the ratio of E-SAR to AirSAR \u03c30 as the subtraction of two logarithmic \nnumbers gives the ratio. \u03c30diff is the difference between AirSAR and E-SAR calculated from \nthe linearly transformed backscatter, \u03c30lin. For comparison a third classification of stand age \nwas produced using mean stand E-SAR L-HV backscatter, to assess whether the \ncombination of E-SAR and AirSAR data provided a better result, than a single image could \nprovide. The two difference images and the E-SAR L-HV image were thresholded to \nidentify three age classes of trees (new stands, young stands and mature stands).The \nthresholds for the three images were determined from frequency distributions of backscatter \nor backscatter difference for the three classes (figure 1). Basing the thresholds on the \nfrequency distributions for the three age classes was possible in this case, although we \nrecognise it is only possible in cases where extensive ground data are available. The \nthresholds were derived from the frequency distributions to identify the optimum class \nseparation and hence maximize the accuracy achieved. Only the HV polarisation data were \nused for this experiment as the cross-polarised backscatter is most sensitive to variations in \nbiomass (Le Toan et al., 1992; Ranson & Sun, 1994; Harrell et al., 1995; Harrell et al., \n1997; Lucas et al., 2006). \n \n3. Results \n3.1 Backscatter difference to estimate forest growth \nTo assess how the accuracy of the results is affected by stand age the results in table 4 are \nreported for five age categories. The five age categories are: 1) Stands that were mature in \n1991; 2) stands that were mature in 2000; 3) stands falling into the young class in 1991; 4) \nstands classed as young in 2000; 5) combined \u2018young and mature\u2019 class combining all the \nstands used in experiments 1 and 2 (see table 3 for young and mature stand definitions). \nFigure 2(a) shows that the height change for stands below saturation point in 1991 \n(the \u2018young in 1991\u2019 class RMSE=0.23m) is more accurately estimated than for stands \nabove saturation point in 1991 (the \u2018mature in 1991\u2019 class RMSE=0.64m) (table 4). The \nsame pattern is shown for the split between young and mature stands in 2000. In the case of \nvolume change, the residuals display high scatter at all levels of change, so the distinction \nbetween young and mature stands is unclear (figure 2(b)). Despite this the volume change \nRMSE is lower for the young classes, than for the mature classes, although the difference is \nless than for the height change results. \n The height change results show that for stands below saturation (i.e. classified as \nyoung) in either 1991 or 2000 the height change can be estimated with a RMSE of about \n0.2m. However, no additional accuracy is gained if the stand is young on both dates \n(compare the \u2018young in 1991\u2019 RMSE of 0.23m to the \u2018young in 2000\u2019 RMSE of 0.20m), \nwhereas if the stand is mature in 1991 and 2000, then the accuracy drops to 0.6m, as the \nbackscatter change contains no information on forest height change. Similar results are \nobserved for volume change. \nThese results suggest that empirically relating backscatter change to height change \nis a useful technique for assessing growth rates of younger forest stands, although the \nmethod is less successful for stand volume. \n  \n3.2 Height \/ Volume differencing to estimate forest growth \nThe best estimates of tree height for 1991 and 2000, for the \u2018young and mature class\u2019, \nproduce errors of 1.75m (figure 3(a)) and 2.50m (figure 3(b)) respectively (table 5). Due to \nsaturation this error is non-linear, with higher errors typically incurred as tree height \nincreases. The height difference between the 2000 and 1991 estimates of height produced \nan RMSE of 2.93m, which is too high for any practical application (figure 3(c)).  Likewise \nthe timber volume change for the \u2018young and mature\u2019 class at RMSE=70.29m3\/ha, for a \nrange of timber volume change from 19m3\/ha to 122m3\/ha, is poor.  The accuracy is higher \nwhen analysis is limited to the young stands, but even then the results from this experiment \nproduce lower accuracy results than the previous experiment. The high error in this \nexperiment occurs because the error from the 1991 and 2000 estimates are propagated \nthrough to the final estimate of change.  \nThe propagation of errors from the 1991 estimates and 2000 estimates into the final \nestimate of height or volume change can be estimated with the error propagation equation: \n2\n_2000\n2\n_1991__ estimateestimateestimategrowth RMSERMSERMSEExpected +=   (3) \nTable 5 shows the observed errors produced by differencing the 1991 and 2000 estimates of \nheight and volume and the expected error, calculated from equation (3), based on the \nRMSE values for 1991 and 2000. The percentage difference between the observed RMSE \nand the expected RMSE is also given in table 5. The error propagation equation estimates \nfor the \u2018mature\u2019 and \u2018young and mature\u2019 classes are generally within 6% of the RMSE \nfound experimentally, with the exception of stand height for the \u2018mature in 1991\u2019 class \nwhich is underestimated by 10.9%. For the \u2018young in 1991\u2019 and \u2018young in 2000\u2019 classes the \nerror propagation model overestimates by between 11% and 26%. This indicates a slight \nsystematic bias within the 1991 and 2000 estimates for some stands, which is not accounted \nfor by the error propagation equation, so leads the observed error to be slightly lower than \nthe expected error.  \nAnalysis of the volume change residuals for the \u2018young in 2000\u2019 class reveals a \ntrend between the errors in the 1991 and 2000 estimates (r2=0.50), with 20 stands being \nunderestimated in both 1991 and 2000, whilst 13 stands were overestimated in both 1991 \nand 2000. The remaining 15 stands were overestimated for one date and underestimated for \nthe other. For the mature stands there are no trends in the residuals for the two dates. The \ntrend in the young stands may indicate some unaccounted for stand structural factor, which \nis biasing the results for both sensors in a systematic way. This is possibly due to either the \ninteraction between incidence angle and stand row structure, or the pre-dominance of yield \nclass 14 in the \u2018young in 2000\u2019 stands (36 yield class 14 stands compared to 12 other \nstands). \nThis method produces lower accuracy than the backscatter difference method, even \nthough substantially more input data were used to generate the stand change estimates. \nHowever, comparison of the observed error against the expected error, using the error \npropagation equation, shows that the estimation accuracy for the younger stands is still \nhigher than expected. \n \n3.3 E-SAR minus AirSAR difference image \nOverall, the backscatter ratio change image performs best with 82% of stands correctly \nclassified (table 6). However, it performs more poorly than the other two methods for the \nnew stands, with only 69% of stands correctly identified, compared to 74% and 85% for the \nbackscatter difference image and the L-HV backscatter image respectively (tables 7 & 8). \nThe addition of multi-temporal data does improve the accuracy with which stands are \nidentified, when the backscatter ratio change method is used, as it enables greater \nseparation of the young and mature stands, which are poorly separated by the other two \nmethods.  \n \n4. Discussion \nThis paper tested three different methods of monitoring forest change over 9 years from \nairborne SAR data. The results show: \n\u2022 Multi-temporal L-band SAR data can be used to monitor and quantify growth rates \nof younger stands, by relating backscatter change to stand height change. \n\u2022 Signal saturation prevents the use of multi-temporal L-band SAR backscatter for \naccurately monitoring growth of mature forest stands, when the stands are beyond \nsaturation point for both image acquisitions. \n\u2022 From a methodological perspective the work suggests that estimating growth \nindirectly from estimates of height\/volume in 1991 and 2000 is highly susceptible to \nerror propagation, whilst the estimation of growth from backscatter difference is \nmore robust and hence preferable. \n\u2022 Dual-date L-band SAR data, from different airborne sensors, can increase the \naccuracy of stand-age classification compared to single-date imagery, as it improves \nthe separation of  young and mature stands.  \nThis suggests L-band SAR backscatter could potentially be used to monitor initial \ngrowth rates of stands to ensure growth proceeds according to expected forest growth \nforecasts and to map broad age classes. However, this does require some ground data to \ngenerate the empirical relationship and this may limit the utility of the methods described in \nsome cases.  \nThetford forest is highly managed and the topography is relatively flat, as such it \nrepresents an \u2018ideal\u2019 test site. Factors which could complicate analysis such as mountainous \ntopography, high within stand age diversity, species heterogeneity and lack of coherent \ngeographical units for analysis are limited. One consequence of the FC management is that \na high level of correlation exists between biophysical variables, such as stand height, \nvolume, biomass, age, basal area and density. Hence, a correlation between backscatter and \none variable implies some degree of correlation between backscatter and the other \nbiophysical variables. The high accuracy of the stand growth estimates from the E-SAR \nand AirSAR backscatter difference (table 4), is partly due to the strong relationships \nbetween stand height and stand height change, as stand height in 1991 and stand height \nchange between 1991 and 2000  are highly correlated, r=0.93. Further investigation showed \nthat a linear relationship developed between AirSAR P-HV \u03c30 and height change, between \n1991 \u2013 2000,  was able to reproduce a similar level of accuracy (RMSE=0.66m; r2=0.59) to \nthat achieved via the E-SAR and AirSAR backscatter difference (section 3.1; table 4) and \nhigher than the height differencing (section 3.2; table 5). This illustrates both the high level \nof consistency between current and future state, within the managed forest stands, and a \nlevel of data redundancy in the SAR data sets. \nCalibration is a critical issue in the analysis of multi-temporal remote sensing data \nsets, particularly when data from different sensors are being compared. The availability of \nthe FC data base and yield models enabled us to create empirical relationships between the \nAirSAR data and the forest state in 1991 and between the ESAR data and the forest state in \n2000. It also enabled us to determine the degree of change between the two dates and hence \nto train the neural networks to estimate this change based on the difference in backscatter. \nConsequently, the neural networks implicitly calibrated for differences in input data and \nany differences in scene moisture levels and their resultant impact on backscatter. \nExtensive calibration would be required to use the same relationship, for example, between \nL-HV backscatter and mean stand height to estimate stand height from both the 1991 and \n2000 data.  \nDue to the ground data available for Thetford it was possible for us to avoid post-\nproduction calibration. The launch of repeat-pass interferometric SAR (InSAR) sensors, \nparticularly L-band sensors, such as ALOS-PALSAR, SEACOM-1 and the proposed \nTerraSAR-L, will increase the capabilities of spaceborne SAR for forestry applications, \nincluding monitoring temporal change. Spaceborne sensors will increase the availability of \ntime-series of data from a single sensor, so removing the need for inter-sensor calibration, \nalthough environmental conditions and sensor degradation will still need to be accounted \nfor.  \nThe key limitation of work, such as this, based on empirical relationships is the \nneed for extensive ground data or proxy ground data to initially parameterise the empirical \nrelationship. Future work will explore more physically based modeling methods to exploit \nthe full polarimetric InSAR (PolInSAR) potential of the E-SAR data set. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis research was funded under the BNSC-LINK Carbon project no.
