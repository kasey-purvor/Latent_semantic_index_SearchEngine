E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 3 \nWhat determines foreign market entry strategies? To answer this question, most existing \nliterature has focused on the characteristics of the entering firm, in particular its resources and \ncapabilities (Barney, 1991; Anand and Delios, 2002) and its need to minimize transaction \ncosts (Buckley and Casson, 1976; Anderson and Gatignon, 1986; Hill, Hwang, and Kim, \n1990). While resources and capabilities are certainly important (Peng, 2001), recent work has \nsuggested that strategies are moderated by the characteristics of the particular context in \nwhich firms operate (Hoskisson et al., 2000; Meyer and Peng, 2005; Tsui, 2004; Meyer, \n2006, 2007).  \nIn particular, institutions\u2014the \u2018rules of the game\u2019\u2014 in the host economy also \nsignificantly shape firm strategies such as foreign market entry (Peng, 2003; Wright et al., \n2005). In a broad sense, macro-level institutions affect transaction costs (North, 1990). \nHowever, traditional transaction cost research (exemplified by Williamson, 1985) has \nfocused on micro-analytical aspects such as opportunism and bounded rationality. As a result, \nquestions of how macro-level institutions, such as country-level legal and regulatory \nframeworks, influence transaction costs have been relatively unexplored, remaining largely as \n\u2018background.\u2019  \n However, a new generation of research suggests that institutions are much more than \nbackground conditions, and that \u2018institutions directly determine what arrows a firm has in its \nquiver as it struggles to formulate and implement strategy and to create competitive \nadvantage\u2019 (Ingram and Silverman, 2002: 20, added italics). Nowhere is this point more \nclearly borne out than in emerging economies, where institutional frameworks differ greatly \nfrom those in developed economies (Khanna, Palepu, and Sindha, 2005; Meyer and Peng, \n2005; Wright et al., 2005; Gelbuda, Meyer, and Delios, 2008). Given these institutional \ndifferences, how do foreign firms adapt entry strategies when entering emerging economies?   \n Focusing on this key question, we argue (1) that institutional development (or \nunderdevelopment) in different emerging economies directly affects entry strategies, and (2) \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 4 \nthat investors\u2019 needs for local resources impact entry strategies in different ways in different \ninstitutional contexts. In essence, we advocate an integrative perspective calling not only for \nexplicit considerations of institutional effects, but also for their integration with resource-\nbased considerations. This article thus responds to the call issued by Meyer and Peng (2005), \nPeng (2001, 2003, 2009), Wright et al. (2005), and Yamakawa, Peng, and Deeds (2008) for \nmore integration between institutional and resource-based views. We achieve this integration \nby focusing on a central concept in both lines of theorizing, namely, the effectiveness of \nmarkets in facilitating access to sought resources. We thus depart from much of the existing \nentry strategy literature, which either focuses on the institutional side (Brouthers and \nBrouthers, 2000; Meyer, 2001; Hitt et al., 2004) or the resource-based side (Anand and \nDelios, 2002). Specifically, we examine how multinational enterprises (MNEs), when \nentering emerging economies, choose among three modes of entry involving foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI): (1) greenfield, (2) acquisition, and (3) joint venture (JV).  \nWe test our hypotheses by integrating unique survey data with archival data from \nEgypt, India, South Africa, and Vietnam (Estrin and Meyer, 2004). These emerging \neconomies are selected because they show substantial variation in formal and informal \ninstitutions. They also represent a cross-section of midsized emerging economies that \nsubstantially liberalized their economies since the 1990s.  \nOverall, this article makes three contributions. First, we enrich an institution-based \nview of business strategy (Oliver, 1997; Peng, 2003; Peng, Wang, and Jiang, 2008) by \nproviding a more fine-grained conceptual analysis of the relationship between institutional \nframeworks and entry strategies. Our primary hypotheses suggest that institutional \ndevelopment reduces the need for a JV partner and thus facilitates acquisition and greenfield \nentry, while resource needs increase the preference for both acquisition and JV, but not \ngreenfield entry. Second, we argue that institutions moderate resource-based considerations \nwhen crafting entry strategies. More specifically, where the institutional framework is weak, \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 5 \nJVs are used to access many resources. However, where institutions are stronger and ensure a \nhigher degree of market effectiveness, JVs become less important while acquisitions become \na more significant tool to access resources that are intangible. Finally, by amassing a primary \nsurvey database from four diverse but relatively underexplored countries and combining such \ndata with archival data, we extend the geographic reach of empirical research on emerging \neconomies. Earlier studies of entry in emerging economies have concentrated on Central and \nEastern Europe (Meyer, 2001; Brouthers and Brouthers, 2003; Meyer and Peng, 2005) and \nChina (Tse, Pan, and Au, 1997; Luo and Peng, 1999; Quer, Claver, and Rienda, 2007). Never \nbefore have foreign entrants in four diverse emerging economies been systematically studied \nvia a common research design and survey instrument as we have done in this study.  \n \nENTRY MODE CHOICES \nThe modes of establishing an FDI project can be classified into three types: (1) \ngreenfield, (2) acquisition, and (3) JV (Kogut and Singh, 1988; Anand and Delios, 2002; \nElango and Sambharya, 2004). JVs and acquisitions both provide access to resources held by \nlocal firms, with JVs partially integrating selected local resources from a local partner and \nacquisitions integrating the local firm in toto. A greenfield project does not directly access a \nlocal firm as a bundle of organizational resources, but allows the entrant to buy or contract \nfor resource components available on local markets, such as real estate and labor.  \nTheoretically, each of these three modes is distinct and satisfies different objectives. \nHowever, most research has used frameworks that imply the choices would be sequential and \nbimodal: on the one hand JV versus acquisition\/greenfield (Anderson and Gatignon, 1986; \nHennart, 1988, Hill et al., 1990; Tse et al., 1997) and on the other hand acquisition versus \ngreenfield (Hennart and Park, 1993; Barkema and Vermeulen, 1998; Anand and Delios, \n2002). These models suggest that ownership and entry mode can be viewed as sequential \ndecisions, with firms first deciding partial (JV) versus full ownership (acquisition\/greenfield) \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 6 \nand then, if full ownership is preferred, choosing between acquisition and greenfield. In \npractice, the two stages in such a sequence are often blurred, as indicated by case studies \n(Estrin and Meyer, 2004) and large-sample studies that examine these three entry choices \nsimultaneously (Kogut and Singh, 1988; Chang and Rosenzweig, 2001; Elango and \nSambharya, 2004; Dikova and van Witteloostuijn, 2007). Moreover, the institutional issues \naffect the ownership and entry mode questions simultaneously. Consequently, we analyze the \nthree entry choices as being interdependent and consider them simultaneously.  \nJVs and acquisitions are used to access resources previously embedded in another \norganization. Yet, why would investors not rather buy the specific resources they need using \nstandard market transactions? Acquiring a firm exposes a firm to major challenges in \nmanaging the purchased business (Haspeslagh and Jemison 1991; Capron, Mitchel, and \nSwaminathan, 2001), and a JV creates substantial coordination challenges (Kogut, 1988; \nBuckley and Casson, 1998). Thus, if the local markets for the necessary resources are \nefficient, foreign entrants may buy the required resources (or their components) using market \ntransactions and thus establish a greenfield operation based on these purchased resources (or \ntheir components). However, efficiency of local markets is not always the norm (Estrin, \n2002). Markets for acquisitions (buying and selling companies) may be especially \nproblematic in emerging economies (Peng and Heath, 1996). More generally, markets for \nacquiring local resources may be suboptimal because of the institutional environment \ngoverning the transaction (North, 1990; Peng, 2006). They may also be suboptimal because \nof the characteristics of the sought resources (Buckley and Casson, 1976; Williamson, 1985). \nWe proceed to discuss these two phenomena and their interaction in the following sections.  \n \nINSTITUTIONS AND ENTRY STRATEGIES \nInstitutions have an essential role in a market economy to support the effective \nfunctioning of the market mechanism, such that firms and individuals can engage in market \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 7 \ntransactions without incurring undue costs or risks (North, 1990; Peng, 2009). These \ninstitutions include, for example, the legal framework and its enforcement, property rights, \ninformation systems, and regulatory regimes. We consider institutional arrangements to be \n\u2018strong\u2019 if they support the voluntary exchange underpinning an effective market mechanism. \nConversely, we refer to institutions as \u2018weak\u2019 if they fail to ensure effective markets or even \nundermine markets (as in the case of corrupt business practices). Where institutions are \nstrong in developed economies, their role, though critical, may be almost invisible. In \ncontrast, when markets malfunction, as in some emerging economies, the absence of market-\nsupporting institutions is \u2018conspicuous\u2019 (MacMillan, 2007). \nInstitutional differences are particularly significant for MNEs operating in multiple \ninstitutional contexts (Globerman and Shapiro, 1999). Formal rules establish the permissible \nrange of entry choices (e.g., with respect to equity ownership) but informal rules may also \naffect entry decisions. Thus, legal restrictions may limit the equity stake that foreign investors \nare allowed to hold (Delios and Beamish, 1999) and informal norms, such as norms \nconcerning whether bribery is acceptable, may favor locally owned firms over MNEs (Peng, \n2003). In other words, because the transactions costs of engaging in these markets are \nrelatively higher, MNEs have to devise strategies to overcome these constraints (Peng, 2009). \nInstitutions also provide information about business partners and their likely behavior, \nwhich reduces information asymmetries\u2014a core source of market failure (Arrow, 1971; \nCasson, 1997). In many emerging economies, weak institutional arrangements may magnify \ninformation asymmetries so firms face higher partner-related risks (Meyer, 2001) and need to \nspend more resources searching for information (Tong, Reuer, and Peng, 2008).  \n  The strengthening of the institutional framework thus lowers costs of doing business \n(Estrin, 2002; Bengoa and Sanchez-Robles, 2003; Bevan, Estrin, and Meyer, 2004) and \ninfluences foreign entrants\u2019 mode decisions by moderating the costs of alternative organizational \nforms (Williamson, 1985). In consequence, the relative costs associated with different entry \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 8 \nmodes are affected by the institutional framework (Henisz, 2000; Meyer, 2001).  \n  In particular, JVs provide a means to access resources held by local firms, including \nresources such as networks that may help to counteract idiosyncrasies of a weak institutional \ncontext (Delios and Beamish, 1999). However, the need for a partner may decline with the \nstrengthening of the institutional framework (Meyer, 2001; Peng, 2003; Steensma et al., 2005). \nFor example, as the regulatory environment in an emerging economy improves, more sectors \nwill be opened to FDI and foreign entrants will face fewer formalities, permits, and licenses. \nHence, a reduction of restrictions on FDI may reduce the need for a local JV partner as an \ninterface with local authorities (Gomes-Casseres, 1990; Delios and Beamish, 1999; Peng, 2006). \nSimilarly, improved regulatory frameworks may reduce the need to rely on relationships of a \nlocal JV partner when dealing with local businesses (Oxley, 1998; Meyer, 2001).  \n  Entry by acquisition is an entry mode that is particularly sensitive to the efficiency \nof markets, especially financial markets and the market for corporate control (Peng, 2009). \nTransactions in financial markets are greatly facilitated by an institutional framework that \nensures transparency, predictability, and contract enforcement (Peng and Heath, 1996; Beim \nand Calomiris, 2003). However, institutional arrangements and the efficiency of financial \nmarkets vary considerably. In developed countries, firms can be taken over via a friendly or \nhostile bid after the acquisition of a substantial proportion of the equity. The restructuring of \nthe acquired firm then allows the separation of wanted and unwanted business units (Capron \net al., 2001), which may also favor foreign entry by acquisition.  \n  However, the weakness of institutions in emerging economies can lead to smaller, \nmore volatile, and less liquid stock markets, which reduces the potential for acquisitions (Lin \net al., 2008). In such an environment, firms are typically controlled by a dominant \nstakeholder (individual or family), a business group, or the state (Khanna and Palepu, 2000; \nKock and Gullen, 2000; Kedia, Mukherjee, and Lahiri, 2006; Young et al., 2008). In \naddition, weak institutions lead to a lack of transparent financial data and other information \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 9 \non firms and a shortage of specialized financial intermediaries (Khanna et al., 2005). Many of \nthe resources and organizational structures of local firms are built around nonmarket forms of \ntransactions, and are therefore harder for potential acquirers to evaluate (Tong et al., 2008). \nThis raises the complexity and transaction costs of undertaking the due diligence and contract \nnegotiations necessary for acquisitions and post-acquisition restructuring (Peng, 2006). Thus, \ncosts and risks increase when institutional frameworks are weaker.  \n  Combining these arguments, we posit that foreign entrants may need access to local \nresources in emerging economies to overcome inefficiencies caused by weak institutions. \nYet, at the same time, weak institutional frameworks make it more difficult to access these \nresources via market transactions (which inhibit greenfield entry) and raise the costs of \nacquiring local firms (which make acquisitions challenging). In contrast, JVs provide a means \nto access local resources where arm\u2019s-length market transactions are difficult. Therefore:  \nH1: The stronger the market-supporting institutions in an emerging economy, the less \nlikely foreign entrants are to enter by joint venture (as opposed to greenfield or \nacquisition). \n \nRESOURCES AND ENTRY STRATEGIES \nEntry by acquisitions or JVs takes the form of pooling resources between a foreign \nentrant and a local firm. In contrast, greenfield projects do not provide access to resources \nembedded in local firms. The choice of entry mode thus depends on whether and to what degree \nforeign entrants require such resources. In emerging economies, investing firms usually require \ncontext-specific resources to achieve competitive advantages (Delios and Beamish, 1999; Meyer \nand Peng, 2005). In contrast, the strategic management literature on entry strategies has \nprimarily focused on the characteristics of resources to be transferred (Kogut and Zander 1993) \nand the characteristics of the investing firm (Anderson and Gatignon, 1986; Hennart and Park, \n1993). This suggests a need to complement this literature by considering the characteristics of \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 10 \nthese sought resources.  \nContext-specific resources come in at least two forms. First, where legal institutions \nsuch as contract law and enforcement of property rights are weak, firms may also need to rely \nmore on network- and relationship-based strategies, thereby developing the ability to enforce \ncontracts, which are often informal, using norms as opposed to litigation. Therefore, networks \nand relationships with other firms, with agents in the distribution channels, and with government \nauthorities are all important assets in emerging economies (Peng and Heath, 1996). \n Second, context-specific capabilities, such as strategic and organizational flexibility, \nmay enhance competitiveness in the volatile environments of emerging economies (Lane, Salk, \nand Lyles, 2001; Uhlenbruck, Meyer, and Hitt, 2003). Other important capabilities may relate \nto managing large local labor forces, managing interfaces with government authorities, and \ndeveloping capabilities that enable firms to build and maintain networks and relationships \n(Kock and Guill\u00e9n, 2000; Henisz, 2003; Van de Ven, 2004). Foreign entrants that consider \nlocal resources to be important for their competitiveness may prefer to establish their operation \nwith a local partner as a JV or through acquisition as opposed to greenfield. Thus:  \nH2a: The stronger the need to rely on local resources to enhance competitiveness, the less \nlikely foreign entrants are to enter an emerging economy by greenfield (as opposed to \nacquisition or joint venture). \nHowever, the likelihood of facing malfunctioning markets varies with the \ncharacteristics of the resources sought. A key distinction in the literature is between tangible \nassets (such as real estate) and intangible assets (such as brands). The transaction cost \nliterature has analyzed entry strategies with respect to the assets, especially knowledge-based \nassets, that an investor would transfer to the new subsidiary (Anderson and Gatignon, 1986; \nHennart and Park 1993). A contract would be preferred if the resource contributions of at \nleast one partner can be sold in a reasonably efficient market (Buckley and Casson, 1998). \nThree arguments have been put forward to suggest that certain types of resources are less \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 11 \nsuitable to market exchange. While this literature has typically focused on resources to be \ntransferred, we extend this line of thought by suggesting that the logic of the argument \nequally applies to resources sought.  \nFirst, information asymmetries are a classic source of market failure. The market for \ninformation is prone to failure because buyers cannot assess the quality of the information \nprior to the exchange. However, once the information is known to both parties, buyers no \nlonger have the incentive to reveal their true valuation of the information (Arrow, 1971; \nAkerlof, 1970). The prevalence of information asymmetries between buyers and sellers thus \nhas long been a core motivation for the internalisation of transactions within firms (Buckley \nand Casson, 1976; Casson, 1997) and for the choice of a JV (Buckley and Casson, 1998; \nBrouthers and Hennart, 2007) or an acquisition (Hennart and Park, 1993) as a mode of entry.  \nSecond, asset specificity is at the core of Williamson\u2019s (1985) transaction cost based \nexplanation of organization forms, which has been applied to entry modes extensively \nfollowing Anderson and Gatgnon (1986). Essentially, the more that business partners invest \nin resources specific to a transaction, the more they create interdependencies that expose \nthem to potential opportunistic behaviour (Brouthers and Hennart, 2007; Brouthers et al., \n2003). This threat may inhibit transactions or encourage firms to internalise operations. Asset \nspecificity arises in FDI in particular from partner-specific learning processes.  \nThird, tacitness of knowledge inhibits its transfer unless instructor and receiver \ninteract directly in a form of learning by doing, but this can make the transfer of knowledge \nvery costly (Teece, 1977). Such learning by interpersonal interaction is difficult to organize \nvia markets, and may be encouraged more effectively within organizations (Kogut and \nZander, 1993). In consequence, interactions that involve the exchange of tacit knowledge \nmay be internalised, again favoring acquisition or JV over greenfield entry.  \n All three lines of argument are more relevant for intangible assets than for tangible \nassets (Bruton, Dess, and Janney, 2007). Asset specificity can in principle occur when \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 12 \nresources are either intangible or tangible while information asymmetries and costs of tacit \nknowledge are challenges that arise from knowledge-components of resources, which are \nlikely to be higher for intangible assets. Entrants may thus prefer to acquire another firm with \nthe pertinent resources, but where such acquisitions are not feasible\u2014for instance in contexts \nwith weak institutions\u2014they are more likely to opt for JV. Hence:   \nH2b: The effect of H2a is stronger when requiring intangible assets compared to tangible \nassets. \n Note that our hypotheses suggest that institutions discriminate primarily between JV \nand acquisition\/greenfield, while resource needs primarily discriminate between greenfield \nand JV\/acquisition. We thus go beyond much of the literature that, even when empirically \ntesting three modes (Kogut and Singh, 1988; Chang and Rosenzweig, 2001; Elango and \nSambharya, 2004), has not provided theoretical arguments for effects separating all three \nmodes. However, how do the institutional and resource effects interact with each other? \n \nINSTITUTIONS + RESOURCES \nTo understand how the two dimensions of institutions and resources interact, consider \ntwo extreme cases (Figure 1). If institutions are very weak and thus fail to ensure even \nmodest efficiency of markets, foreign entrants would not be able to rely on markets to access \nlocal resources (cells 1-3). Under such conditions, acquisition may be prohibitively costly \nbecause of financial markets inefficiency. Moreover, in this situation it is likely that the \nresources of the acquired firm could not be properly valued and their integration would be \nchallenging. Hence, foreign entrants in need of local resources would prefer creation of a new \nentity in partnership with a local firm, with both partners contribution selected resources and \nsharing control. This would apply to both tangible and intangible resources (cells 2 and 3).  \n* * * Figure 1 about here * * * \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 13 \nIn the opposite extreme case, where strong institutions make markets highly efficient, \nforeign entrants would probably be able to use contracts to arrange most transactions (cells 4-\n6). Thus, greenfield entry becomes highly feasible. In this situation, acquiring resources in \nthe form of tangible assets would not posit substantial challenges (cell 5). However, the three \nsources of market failure outlined above would still affect transactions in intangible \nresources. For example, transactions in goods or services with a high content of knowledge \nwould be potentially subject to information asymmetries (Arrow, 1971; Buckley and Casson, \n1998), asset specificity (Williamson, 1985), or costly transfer of tacit knowledge (Teece, \n1977; Kogut and Zander, 1993). However, under strong institutions, the market for corporate \ncontrol is relatively efficient and enables firms to engage in acquisition (cell 6).  \n Hence, we expect that under strong institutions, acquisitions would be more likely to \nbe used when foreign entrants seek intangible resources held by local firms (cell 6), while \ngreenfield operations are appropriate when relatively fewer local resources are required (cell \n4), or when resources are tangible and can be acquired or accessed using market transactions \n(cell 5). Specifically:  \nH3a: Under conditions of strong institutions, the greater the need of foreign entrants for \nintangible resources, the more likely they are to use acquisition or joint venture rather than \ngreenfield.  \nH3b: Under conditions of strong institutions, the need for local tangible resources will not \ninfluence the choice of entry mode. \nOverall, in the empirical analysis, we expect a significant moderating effect of \nintangible resource needs on the institutional effect that is opposite to the direct effect, while \nthe corresponding moderating effect of tangible resources may not be significant. \n \nMETHODOLOGY \nFour Emerging Economies \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 14 \nTo test our hypotheses we require a cross-country sample that shows variation on the \nfocal independent variable, yet, limited variation on other dimensions. We have thus selected \nfour emerging economies with considerable variation in their institutional environment: \nEgypt, India, South Africa, and Vietnam (Table 1). However, they all show similarities with \nrespect to other features that may influence FDI. For example, each is an important economy \nin its region, and each has pursued significant economic reforms since the 1990s. As a result \nof reforms, each experienced a surge of inward FDI during the 1990s. Annual FDI inflows \npeaked at $3 billion in Egypt (1999), $3.4 billion in India (2001), $6.7 billion in South Africa \n(2001), and $2.6 billion in Vietnam (1997) (United Nations, 2005). FDI inflows have \nremained relatively strong since then. \n* * * Table 1 about here * * * \nVariations in the local institutional environments include, for example, a fairly \ndeveloped financial infrastructure in South Africa. Moreover, the institutional environment \nhas been evolving differently in the four countries\u2014improving particularly markedly in \nVietnam (Meyer and Nguyen, 2005). The cross-country diversity implies that data pooled \nfrom these four economies provide significant variations in terms of institutions that may \naffect MNE entry strategies.  \nMethods of Empirical Analysis \nThe collection of the data for this article has been an ambitious, multicountry \nendeavor with project team members based in Western Europe as well as in each of the four \nemerging economies. Joint meetings were held in these four countries to prepare the study \nand to discuss key findings with the local business community. We collected our data in the \nfour countries by combining questionnaire data with archival data. Our survey instrument \nprovides data about the local subsidiaries, the parent MNEs, and managers\u2019 perceptions of the \nlocal environment. In addition, we conducted twelve highly informative field-based case \nstudies, three in each country, that helped us design this study (Estrin and Meyer, 2004). \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 15 \nQuestionnaire. Our survey targeted CEOs of local MNE subsidiaries\u2014both local \nexecutives and expatriates\u2014as they are the most appropriate informants on the crucial \naspects of the local context and the local operations. The questionnaire was developed by the \nauthors in cooperation with the field research team leaders in each of the four countries, \nincluding a pilot on about 35 firms during 2001. The questionnaire was revised based on the \nfeedback provided in the pilot stage and the insights generated by the case studies.  \nBase population. The base population for our survey was defined as all FDI projects \nnewly registered in the four countries between 1990 and 2000 that had a minimum \nemployment of 10 persons and minimum of 10% equity stake by the foreign investor. For the \ncurrent analysis, we only use the subset of post-1994 entries to reduce biases that may affect \nsurvey data referring to events too distant in the past. The stipulations concerning size and \nequity stake of the foreign investor ensured that sampled firms were substantive and \noperational businesses. The base population was constructed from locally available databases. \nIn India and Vietnam, comprehensive databases were obtained from FDI regulatory \nauthorities. In Egypt and South Africa, the base population had to be constructed from scratch \nusing commercial databases supplemented with research by the country research teams.  \nData collection. The questionnaire was administered between 2001 and 2002.1 MNE \nsubsidiaries were selected using stratified random sampling. The stratification was used to \nensure that the inter-industry distribution of firms in the sample closely resembled that of the \npopulation at the 2-digit level. Once a firm was selected, teams that were specially trained for \nthe administration of the questionnaire interviewed a top-level manager, usually the CEO. A \ntotal of 613 responses were received\u2014response rates were 10% in Egypt, 11% in India, 23% \nin Vietnam, and 31% in South Africa. If less than 150 firms responded in any country, the \n                                                 \n1\n In Vietnam, respondents received the questionnaire with both English and Vietnamese versions\u2014in \nthe case of Chinese\/Taiwanese parent firms, they also received a Chinese version. The translations to \nVietnamese and Chinese were done with the established back-translation procedures. While the \nChinese version turned out to be an important instrument to establish contact and trust with the firms, \nalmost all preferred to complete the Vietnamese or English versions. In the other three countries, \nEnglish is established as the major language of business and we abstained from translation. \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 16 \nsample size was made up by replacement using randomly selected firms in each 2-digit \nindustry. However, we dropped observations referring to entries before 1994 or with missing \nvalues, so our regression model uses 336 responses.  \nWe investigated whether the pattern of missing values might lead to bias in the \nestimation. We analysed the characteristics of enterprises by missing values in terms of \ncountry, sector, size and entry mode, testing whether the observations had to be dropped \nbecause missing values were systematically different from those retained in the sample. \nSimilar tests were conducted to compare the questionnaire returns with the base population. \nOverall, we found little evidence of significant sample selection bias.2 \nMain Variables and Models  \nOur dependent variable is a categorical one, taking the value of 1 for greenfield, 2 for \nacquisition, and 3 for JV. The classification is based on the self-classification by respondents in \nthe questionnaires, and has been triangulated by other questions in the survey.  \nWe use a multinomial logit (M-Logit) regression model that estimates the effect of the \nindependent variables on the probability (differential odds) that one of the alternatives is \nchosen. Independent variables combine respondents\u2019 assessment on Likert-type scales and \nobjective measures like data on the parent firm as well as archival data (notably, on institutions) \nto avert common method bias. The explanatory variables are as follows\u2014the survey instrument \nis available upon request. \n Institutions. Based on archival data, we proxy the strength of market-supporting \ninstitutions by five items of the economic freedom index developed by the Heritage \nFoundation (Kane et al., 2007). This index provides information about a broad notion of \ninstitutions, focusing on the freedom of individuals and firms in a country to pursue their \nbusiness activities. It contains data about 50 independent variables divided into 10 categories. \n                                                 \n2\n We employed the two step Heckman procedure. In the first stage a probit model was estimated with \nthe dummy dependent variable taking the value 1 if an observation is included in the sample and zero \notherwise. This regression had a poor fit and the coefficients of the Inverse Mills Ratio in the second \nstage regressions were not significant. \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 17 \nThis index has been used extensively, usually in its aggregate form, and has been found to be \nrelated positively to FDI inflows (Bengoa and Sanchez-Robles, 2003), economic growth \n(Easton, 1997; Berggren and Jordahl, 2005), and social welfare (Stroup, 2007).  \n Our theoretical considerations suggest that our concept of institutions focuses on \ninstitutions that support market efficiency. Therefore, we have selected five categories that \nmost closely reflect the efficiency of markets: (1) business freedom, (2) trade freedom, (3) \nproperty rights, (4) investment freedom, and (5) financial freedom.3 This index incorporates \nthe World Bank\u2019s (2006) Doing Business indices that are used in similar research. We used \nthe economic freedom data published in 2007, which report each category on a scale of zero \nto 100, but include data since the original creation of the index.4 This proxy has an essential \nadvantage over other measures used in the literature as it is available as time series, which \nallow us to assign each observation the value pertaining to the year of entry.5  \nResource needs. We constructed two indices to measure the need of investors for \ntangible assets and intangible assets. The survey instrument asked the MNE subsidiaries to \nrespond to two related questions out of a list of 17 items (see appendix), which was generated \nfrom our case research and refined in the pilot study. The first asked them to identify the three \ntypes of resources that were most important to the success of their business ventures. The second \nquestion asked the respondents to provide information about the extent to which these resources \nwere contributed by the parent MNE, the local subsidiary (if any), overseas markets, and the \nlocal market (in percentage terms). We classified each resource as tangible or intangible, and \ndefined the share of resources sourced from the host country as the sum of the shares sourced \n                                                 \n3\n The items not included are fiscal freedom (a measure of taxation rates), freedom from government \n(share of government in GDP), monetary freedom (inflation and price controls), freedom from \ncorruption and labour freedom.  These do not directly support the efficiency of markets and therefore \nnot a suitable measure of our theoretical construct.  \n4\n However, these data are incomplete for the early 1990s, such that we truncated the data to include \nonly entrants from 1994 onwards. Moreover, we interpolated the economic freedom index for some \nmissing years as it used to be published only every second year. \n5\n Other studies use for instance the World Competitiveness indices (Gaur and Lu, 2007; Yiu and \nMakino, 2002), which however are not available for longer periods using a consistent definition. \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 18 \nfrom the local partner and the host country market. Given this information, we defined the \ntangible index and intangible index, which reflect the relative contribution of local resources to \nthe overall package of resources that the firm considers essential for its competitiveness, giving \nmore weight to the resources ranked as more important.  \nSpecifically, let the percentage of a resource i sourced from the host country be xi. Each \nresource is assigned a weight corresponding with its ranking by the respondent, which may be 1, \n2, 3, or 0 (not ranked). Let wi be the weight associated with each xi, so that w1 = 3, w2 = 2, w3=1, \nand w0 = 0. For both types of resources, the index was calculated using the formula  \n\u2211i wi xi \/ \u2211i wi. \nControl Variables \nWe need to control for variation in the data arising from three sources: the MNE, the \ncountry of origin, and the host economy. In addition, we include a time trend.  \nMNE parent. Prior research has shown that resources contributed by the foreign \npartner are a major cause of internalization. Thus, foreign investors transferring assets that \nare potentially subject to market failure would be more likely to establish greenfield or \nacquisition rather than JV, which is well established in the literature (Gatignon and Anderson, \n1988; Kogut and Zander, 1993; Brouthers and Hennart, 2007). Thus, we control for R&D-\nbased capabilities (Kogut and Singh, 1988; Hennart and Park, 1993; Brouthers and Brouthers, \n2000), which we proxy by R&D intensity, measured by R&D expenditures as a percentage of \nsales on a scale from 1 (0-0.5%) to 7 (over 15%). Moreover, firms focusing on specific \nproduct lines, where they possess unique knowledge of processes and practices, may prefer \ngreenfield entry, while diversified firms may prefer acquisition or JV (Hennart and Larimo, \n1998; Brouthers and Brouthers, 2000). Thus, we include a dummy variable that takes the \nvalue of 1 if the parent is a conglomerate MNE, and 0 if it is focused or related diversified.  \nMNEs establishing subsidiaries that are large relative to their existing operations may \nnot possess all the required resources, and thus may opt for a JV or acquisition to access \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 19 \ncomplementary resources (Hennart and Park, 1993; Brouthers and Brouthers, 2000). \nTherefore, we control for this effect using relative size, which is based on a 6-point scale \nreported in the questionnaire, where 1 stands for 0 to 0.1% and 6 stands for over 20% of the \nMNE\u2019s global turnover. Moreover, the experience of foreign entrants influences international \nstrategies (Barkema and Vermeulen, 1998; Luo and Peng, 1999), for which we control with \ntwo dummy variables. They capture respectively prior commercial experience in the same \nhost country (experience country) or other emerging economies (experience EM).  \nLocal context. We control for other aspects of the local context that in addition to \ninstitutions affect entry strategies in multiple ways. First, we include GDP of the host economy \nas a measure of market size. Second, we control for unobserved characteristics of the local \nindustries, using five industry dummies. Third, we control for other time varying effects, such as \na general improvement of the business climate, by including a time trend from 1 for 1994 to 7 \nfor 2000. This allows us to separate the institutional effects from other environmental changes. \nTwo measures control for characteristics of potential local target firms that may \ninfluence the available options for entry (Hitt et al., 2004). Local firm quality is a 3-item \nmeasure of respondents perceptions about the quality of the resources of local competitors at the \ntime of entry, each based on a 5-point Likert scale (Crombach\u2019s alpha 0.79).

The national origin of investors may impact the choice of entry \nmode (e.g. Hennart and Larimo, 1998). Therefore, we include GDP per capita of the \ninvestor\u2019s home country and we control for cultural differences between home countries, \nusing a cluster approach suggested by Ronen and Shenkar (1985). Thus, eight dummies are \nintroduced based on nine clusters of countries of origin.6  \n                                                 \n6\n Because none of the firms in the sample originated in Latin America, we used only seven of Ronen \nand Shenkar\u2019s (1985) eight clusters.

Table 2 shows that no substantive correlations affect the other \nindependent variables.  \n*** Table 2 about here *** \n \nRESULTS  \n The results of the multinomial regression model are shown in Table 3. We report the \nmarginal effects of the probability that any of the three alternatives being chosen over the \nother two. Two equations are presented: Model 1 incorporates the direct effects of both \ninstitutions and resource and Model 2 introduces the moderating effects. In other words, \nModel 1 is nested in Model 2. We gain confidence in our regression specification from the \nfact that the model statistics reported in the table are satisfactory. Model 2 provides a better \nfit with substantially higher Wald and R2 statistics, indicating that the moderating effects are \nsignificant. In fact, on the basis of F tests we cannot accept the restriction that the moderating \ninfluences are insignificant, which implies that Model 2 is statistically the preferred \nspecification. This indicates that the model with interaction effects should be used primarily \nto assess the hypotheses. The models also predict well\u2014Model 2 generates 61.7% correct \npredictions, compared to a baseline random prediction of 40.6% (an increase of 52.1%). \n* * * Table 3 about here * * * \n We also report results with and without a time trend in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. \nThe time trend is not significantly related to any of the core variables (Table 2), suggesting \nthe institutional variation in the dataset arises primarily due to cross-country variation rather \nthan common trends across countries and time. One might, however, speculate that time trend \nand institutions are related. Thus, a conservative interpretation of the results would suggest \n                                                                                                                                                        \ncovered), and we added a cluster for other countries not covered by Ronen and Shenkar (1985), all of \nwhich are emerging economies. \nK.

Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 21 \nusing whichever model that shows the weaker support for hypotheses. \n*** Table 4 about here *** \n The results are largely consistent with our hypotheses. In Hypothesis 1, we \nproposed that stronger institutions would discourage JVs and facilitate greenfield and \nacquisition entry. Using Model 2, strong support emerges for the hypothesis on all three \ncoefficients: significantly positive on greenfield and acquisition, and significantly negative on \nJV. The time trend slightly weakens the size of the coefficients on institutions (compare \nTable 3 and 4), suggesting that the time trend may be capturing a part of the strengthening of \ninstitutions experienced in these countries. In Models 1 (Table 3) and 3 (Table 4), with only \ndirect effects, the hypothesis is also supported with respect to acquisitions, while the \ncoefficients on greenfield and JV are correctly signed. We note that the institutional effect on \nacquisitions is the only effect that has a 1%-level effect on acquisitions in Model 2, \nsuggesting that institutions are particularly important to facilitate acquisition entry.  \n The results are more mixed with respect to Hypotheses 2. Commencing with \nHypothesis 2a, the results are different using the models with and without interaction effects. \nWithout interaction effects, the regression results appear to provide strong support for \nHypothesis 2a (Model 1 in Table 3 and Model 3 in Table 4), with negative effects on \ngreenfield and positive effects on JV and acquisition. In the preferred model with interaction \neffects, however, the size of the coefficients are similar but the standard deviations are higher \nso the estimates are not significant (Models 2 and 4). With respect to Hypothesis 2b, we find \nthat the differences in the size coefficients are as expected, but very small. Thus, our findings \nare consistent with the proposed signs of the hypothesis but are not significant.  \nWith respect to Hypothesis 3a, we find that, as predicted, the moderating effect is \npositive on greenfield and negative on JV (Model 2 in Table 3 and Model 4 in Table 4), and \nthus opposite to the direct effect of institutions. Hence, firms seeking intangible resources \nwould use JV even when the institutional framework becomes stronger. Moreover, the \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 22 \nmoderating effect on tangible resources is not significant, as predicted in Hypothesis 3b. \nHence, firms seeking local tangible resources, like those not seeking any local resources, \nbecome less likely to enter by JV when institutions become stronger.  \n We conclude that, as predicted, institutional and resource effects crucially interact. \nStrengthening the institutional environment directly encourages acquisition and greenfield \nentry at the expense of JV entry. However, even when institutions are better developed, if \nforeign entrants need intangible local resources, they may still use JVs as an entry mode \nbecause they are exposed to product-related inefficiencies in markets.  \n The pattern of control variables also largely corresponds to our expectations. \nConglomerate MNEs entering an emerging economy are more likely to choose JV entry, \nconsistent with earlier studies (Hennart and Larimo, 1988; Brouther and Brouthers, 2000). Of \nparticular interest may be the country-of-origin effects, which account for a large share of \nexplanatory power of the model, according to Wald tests. Germanic, Japanese\/Korean, and \nArab MNEs are more likely to opt for JVs and against greenfield than US and UK MNEs. In \naddition, investors originating from high income countries are more likely to choose JV as \nentry mode. Entrants from Near East (Greece, Turkey, and Israel in Ronan and Shenkar\u2019s \n[1985] definition) and from other emerging economies are less likely to enter by acquisition. \nThese patterns are interesting because we did not find significant effects when we used the \nmore popular index of cultural distance developed by Kogut and Singh (1988) (regressions \nnot reported). Thus, the Ronan and Shenkar (1985) clusters may be more suitable than the \nKogut and Singh index to control for country of origin variations in entry mode equations.   \n \nDISCUSSION  \nContributions \n In response to recent calls for more integration between institution-based and \nresource-based perspectives in emerging economies (Peng, 2001; Meyer and Peng, 2005; \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 23 \nWright et al., 2005; Yamakawa et al., 2008), this article makes three theoretical, empirical, \nand methodological contributions. Theoretically, we argue that (1) the level of development \nof an emerging economy\u2019s market-supporting institutions directly influences MNEs\u2019 entry \nstrategies by facilitating entry by greenfield and acquisition, and that (2) institution-based \nconsiderations complement resource-based considerations when crafting entry strategies. \nTherefore, we enrich an institution-based view of business strategy (Oliver, 1997; Peng, \n2003, 2009; Gelbuda et al., 2008; Peng et al., 2008) by providing a fine-grained analysis of \nthe relationship between institutional frameworks and entry strategies. \nEmpirically, through a rigorous, four-country survey design combined with archival \ndata, we find that the stronger the institutional framework, the more likely investors would \nchoose acquisitions and greenfield. The literature has so far investigated the role of \ninstitutions at aggregate levels (Meyer, 2001; Wan and Hoskisson, 2003; Dikova and van \nWitteloostuijn, 2007) or focusing on indirect effects such as uncertainty due to instable \ninstitutions (Delios and Henisz, 2000; Brouthers and Brouthers, 2003). We have argued that it \nis their effect on the effectiveness of markets\u2014or their reduction of institutional voids \n(Khanna and Palepu, 2000; Kedia et al., 2006)\u2014that provides the incentives to internalize \nresource acquisitions and this influences entry choices.  \nMoreover, we tease out how institution-based and resource-based variables \ncomplement and interact to predict entry strategies. We have argued that these two decisions \nare interdependent because both resource and institutional variables affect the suitability of \nmarkets as channel to access local resources (Figure 1). Hence, studies on entry modes \nfocusing on product and firm characteristics (Hennart and Park, 1993; Luo, 2002) may \ngenerate results that cannot be generalised beyond the specific host context in which the \nstudy has been conducted (Meyer, 2006, 2007).  \nOf particular interest may be our findings with respect to acquisitions. The positive \neffect of institutional development on acquisition entry is significant even without controlling \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 24 \nfor interaction effect, and moreover it stands out as the only highly significant effect \nexplaining acquisition entry. Thus, more efficient markets facilitate acquisition entry. In part \nthis may be due to the development of financial markets. However, other markets (such as \nproduct, labor, and technology markets) may be also important for effective acquisitions \nbecause they provide critical information that in turn is essential to value the acquisition \ntarget (Lee, Peng, and Lee, 2008). Moreover, where institutions are weak, firms may rely to a \nlarge extent on network- and relationship-based interaction (Peng and Heath, 1996), yet such \nnetwork and relationship resources are hard to value as well. Furthermore, acquisitions are \nstrongly negatively associated with certain countries of origin, namely the Near East and \nemerging economies. This may be because MNEs from these countries have fewer financial \nresources to draw upon, or they lack experience in this mode due to the relatively inactive \nmarket for corporate control in their own home countries (Tsang and Yip, 2007).   \nFinally, we also make two small methodological contributions. First, we introduce \ntime varying proxies of institutions\u2014economic freedom. In the spirit of Peng (2003), this \napproach allows empirical studies to analyze the impact of institutions (or other country-level \nvariables) to exploit variation over time, where cross-country variation closely correlates with \nother country-level variables. Second, we find that the Ronen and Shenkar (1985) cultural \nclusters provide a more powerful means to control for country-of-origin effects than the \npopular Kogut and Singh (1998) index. Therefore, studies controlling for country effects may \nneed to consider the Ronen and Shenkar clusters, especially when dealing with emerging \neconomies. Moreover, more research is warranted to explore the nature and causes of the \ncountry-of-origin variation that emerges so powerfully in our results (Tsang and Yip, 2007).  \nLimitations and Future Research Directions  \n First, a pertinent question for empirical studies is always whether the empirical \nrelationships identified in the study could be explained by different mechanisms than those \nproposed by the authors. In our case, we may be concerned about possible correlations of our \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 25 \ninstitutional variable based on the economic freedom index with other country-specific \neffects. To minimize this possibility, we use a time-varying measure and control for a time \ntrend, GDP, and source country characteristics, the most likely additional influences. Future \nresearchers may wish to work with larger sets of countries, so as to increase the cross-country \nvariance in the set of institutional independent variables. \n  A second concern is the quality of proxies. We collected local data to get as close as \npossible to the context (the focus of our research), and thus distinguish ourselves from earlier \nstudy designs driven by MNE headquarters perspectives. At the same time, we are able to \nrepresent a wide cross-section of host and home countries. This compares very favourably \nwith numerous studies using single-country data. Moreover, we combine two different types \nof data\u2014namely, archival and survey data\u2014to avert common method biases. However, this \napproach implies that our controls for the parent firms may not be as good as in earlier \nresearch. Future research may aim to improve this by collecting data at two sites in each \nfirm\u2014both headquarters and local subsidiary. \n Third, we only investigate equity-based foreign entry modes (Tse et al., 1997) and do \nnot differentiate levels of subsidiary ownership (Dhanaraj and Beamish, 2004). An advanced \nmodelling approach may try to integrate non-equity modes (Wang and Nicholas, 2007; \nWelsh, Benito, and Petersen, 2007) in the analysis to test for possible interdependencies of \nthis decision with the choice between JV, acquisition and greenfield, and\/or to differentiate \nequity modes by their level of ownership.  \n Finally, our study leaves a number of questions awaiting future research. Addressing \nthese questions will not only make more progress on research focusing on emerging \neconomies, but will also propel the global research agenda. These questions are: \n\u2022 What are the specific aspects of institutions that explain variations of business strategies \nboth over time and between countries?  \n\u2022 What exactly are the resources that foreign entrants acquire from local partners, and in \nK. E. Meyer, S. Estrin, S. Bhaumik, and M. W. Peng (2008) \nInstitutions, resources, and entry strategies in emerging economies (SMJ, forthcoming) \n 26 \nwhat ways are transactions in these resources inhibited by the specific market failures of \nemerging economies to such an extent that they would become internalized?  \n\u2022 How does the supply side of local resources, embedded in local firms or otherwise, \nconstrain entry strategies? In particular, what aspects of local firms and industry would \nsignificantly inhibit acquisition strategies?  \n \nCONCLUSION \n  What determines market entry strategies into emerging economies? Our answer is \n(1) that institutions directly influence such entry strategies, and (2) that this effect is \nmoderated by the entrant\u2019s need for different types of local resources. Our theoretical \nframework shows that this interaction arises from the simultaneous impacts of resource and \ninstitutional characteristics on the efficiency of markets for a given transaction, in particular \nforeign entrants\u2019 interest in local resources\u2014both tangible and intangible. In conclusion, if \nthis article could only contain one message, we would like it to be a sense of not only the \nstrong explanatory and predictive power of institutions, but also the significant increase of \nour understanding when the institution-based view is integrated with the resource-based \nview.  \n \nReferences \nAkerlof K. 1970.
