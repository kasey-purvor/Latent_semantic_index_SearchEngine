Of the theoretical resources typically taken as the underlying \nfoundations of critical social psychology, elements, typically, each of Marxism, \nfeminism, psychoanalysis, and Post-Structuralism, one particular mode of \ncritique remains notably absent: postcolonial theory. What might be the most \ncrucial contributions that postcolonial critique can make to the project of critical \npsychology? One answer is that of a reciprocal forms of critique, the retrieval of \na \u2018psychopolitics\u2019 in which we not only place the psychological within the \nregister of the political, but - perhaps more challengingly - in which the political \nis also, strategically, approached through the register of the psychological. What \nthe writings of Fanon and Biko make plain in this connection is the degree to \nwhich the narratives and concepts of the social psychological may be \nreformulated so as to fashion a novel discourse of resistance, one that opens up \nnew avenues for critique for critical psychology, on one hand, and that affords \nan innovative set of opportunities for the psychological investigation of the \nvicissitudes of the postcolonial, on the other. \n \nKeywords: postcolonial, psychopolitics, critical psychology, political, Fanon, \nBiko, Bhabha, psychoanalysis, resistance, racism \n \nThe most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed  \nSteve Biko. \n \nOf the theoretical resources typically taken as the underlying foundations of critical \nsocial psychology, elements, typically, each of Marxism, feminism, psychoanalysis, \nand, perhaps chiefly, the 'turn to text' characteristic of Post-Structuralism (Gough & \nMcFadden, 2001; Hepburn, 2003; Parker, 1999, 2002; Walkerdine, 2002), one \nparticular mode of critique remains notably absent, that of postcolonial theory. What \nmakes this omission so conspicuous is that much postcolonial theory is explicitly \npsychological in both its concerns and its critical resources. Fanon's (1986) Black Skin \nWhite Masks, for example, makes ample reference to various psychological and \npsychoanalytic formulations as way of accentuating what one might term the 'identity \ntrauma' of blackness in colonial contexts, and as way of articulating the depth and \ntenacity of the psychical components of racism (Bulhan, 1985). Homi Bhabha (1983) \nlikewise cross-references a series of psychoanalytic notions \u2013 chiefly that of the fetish, \nbut also the condensation and displacement of the dreamwork, and the narcissistic \naggressivity of the mirror-stage ego-formation \u2013 in his reformulation of that classic \nsocial psychological notion of the stereotype. While the conceptual framework of \npsychoanalysis is absent in the writings of Steve Biko (1978), his political objectives \nare powerfully, even if strategically psychological in nature. It is by drawing upon the \nterms of this discourse of self, identity, subjectivity that certain of the key features of \nthe Black Consciousness Movement come to light. In many ways Black \nConsciousness takes as its goal exactly the consolidation of positive and politicized \nforms of black culture and identity, certainly inasmuch as they play their role in \ngenerating political solidarity amongst the oppressed.  \n Each of these above sets of critical formulations provide powerful ways of \nthinking the conjunction of the psychological and the political, the affective and the \nstructural, the psychical and the governmental. We have as such a powerfully critical \ncombination of registers that one would take to lie at the centre of critical \npsychology\u2019s ostensibly critical concerns (Hayes, 1989; Hook, 2004a). Why then \nhave such post- or anti-colonial thinkers 1 not featured more strongly in the \nconceptual resources of critical social psychology? How might their work, and their \ncharacteristic concerns \u2013 racism, colonial discourse, cultural dispossession, alterity, \npsychical mutilation, resistance, etc. - alert us to gaps in the growing orthodoxy of \ncritical psychology? To approach the question from another direction: what might be \nsaid to be the \u2018critical psychology\u2019 of these theorists, and particularly of Frantz Fanon \nand Steve Biko? How might their use of the register of the psychological within the \npolitical and their concerns with the cultural dynamics of colonisation alert us to the \npossibilities of psychology as a vocabulary of resistance? Furthermore, what does \neach of these critics have to tell us about the crowning problematic of the colonial and \npostcolonial condition, namely that of racism, a phenomena that seems as political as \nit does psychical in nature? Before turning to a brief discussion of the work of each of \nthe above theorists it will be necessary to underline what I mean when I refer both to \n\u2018critical social psychology\u2019 and \u2018postcolonial criticism\u2019. \n \n \nCritical social psychology and political critique \n \nThere have been a series of attempted definitions of critical social psychology of late. \nGough & McFadden (2001), for example, have put forward an understanding of a \ncritical social psychology that \u2018challenges social institutions and practices \u2013 including \nthe discipline of psychology \u2013 that contribute to forms of inequality and oppression\u2019 \n(p. 2). This is a version of social psychology, they suggest, in which practitioners \nsituate themselves within society and its problems, a social psychology which \u2018gets \ninvolved, which adopts particular positions in important debates on\u2026issues such as \nprejudice, violence\u2026crime, etc\u2019 (p. 2). Valerie Walkerdine (2002) has similarly \nsuggested a move away from the academy to politics, an understanding of a critical \npsychology that expresses a pronounced commitment to the theories of post-\nstructuralism, and that stresses the importance \u2018not of psychology per se, but\u2026of the \nsubject and conceptions of subjectivity for politics\u2019 (p. 1). Critical psychology she \nclaims is hence \u2018an umbrella term which describes a number of politically radical \nresponses to and differences from mainstream psychology\u2026[including] perspectives \nof\u2026feminism, ethnic and anti-racist politics\u2019 (Walkerdine, 2002, p. 2). Tellingly \nhowever, Walkerdine (2002) comments on how the political commitment which has \ngenerated such anti-racist, feminist, gay liberation changes seems largely \u2018to have has \nbeen lost\u2019 (p. 2)  \n Hepburn (2003) thinks of critical social psychology as focussed on issues of \npolitics, morality and social change, and as being predominantly concerned with \nissues of oppression, exploitation and human well-being. Critical social psychology \nthough is also \u2018critical of psychology itself\u2026its assumptions, its practices\u2019 (p. 1). \nHowever, she notes (2003), this dual task of criticizing society and criticizing the \ndiscipline sometimes leads to these two factors working against one another. Turning \nto Parker (2002), we may understand critical psychology as the systematic \nexamination of how dominant accounts of psychology operate ideologically, and in \nthe services of power. Importantly though, this \u2018heterogeneous process of critique\u2019 \nshould ideally spread to forms of social action (Goodley & Parker, 2000). A tension \nagain seems apparent here between intellectual undertakings against psychology, and \nthe broader sphere of political activism, as I have noted elsewhere (Hook, 2001).  \n If we are to assess critical psychology in terms of the above definitions, we \nmay well arrive at the conclusion that its agendas of political activity remain of a \nparticularly limited sort, particularly in so far as they remain focussed on the critique \nof psychology itself. Work falling under the rubric of \u2018critical psychology\u2019 may of \ncourse exceed the above definitions, and hence we would be at fault to making \nsweeping claims regards the shortcomings of critical psychology as a whole. \nNevertheless, the question poses itself as to whether it might not be worthwhile \noffering a slightly different description of, or focus for, critical psychology than those \ngiven above. May we not, by contrast, suggest that critical psychology should \nconstitute an investigation of the relation between power and psychology, that it \nshould be concerned both with the critique of oppressive use of psychology and with \nenabling potentially transformative forms of practice (from within psychology, or \nfrom without) which disrupt imbalances of power and which have social equality as \ntheir goal (Hook, 2004a)? \n To be clear then, the critique that I will go on to offer does not take critical \npsychology as a whole as a target, rather it focuses on a set of depoliticizing \ntendencies within critical psychology best outlined by Hayes (2001).  Critical \npsychology, he argues, needs reconsider what it means to be critical, that it need \nfocus on what prospective critical historical antecedents it might best align itself so as \nto overcome this gap between intellectual and political activity, between insular \ncritical engagements with psychology itself, and the broader realm of social action. \nThis search for strategic theoretical forms, he claims, needs be lead by a suspicion of \nthe neutralizing trappings neo-liberalism (Hayes, 2001). In his words: \n \n[C]ritical psychology needs to engage with and develop concepts that have the potential \nto transcend merely abstract...analysis, and point the way to practical...political \nengagement... [C]ritical psychology would be...incomplete if it did not try to take on \nthe injustices and inequalities of the world that we find ourselves in. (2001, p. 47) \n \n \nPostcolonial criticism \n \nHaving identified an area of concern within the general domain of critical psychology, \nwe should now turn our attention to introducing the \u2018postcolonial\u2019. In this connection, \nwe may turn to Homi Bhabha who provides an adroit summary of both the concerns \nand the scope of postcolonial criticism. (Although I will not discuss Bhabha\u2019s work in \nany detail here, he usefully enables us to frame the discussion of the writings of Fanon \nand Biko, and to emphasize at certain points, trenchant points of my overall \nargument). Postcolonial criticism, he writes \u2018bears witness to the unequal and uneven \nforces of cultural representation involved in the contest for political and social \nauthority within the modern world\u2019 (1994, p. 171).  \n \nPostcolonial perspectives emerge from the colonial testimony of Third World countries \nand the discourses of \u2018minorities\u2019 within the geopolitical divisions of East and West, \nNorth and South\u2026[Their aim is to] intervene in those ideological discourses of \nmodernity that attempt to give a hegemonic \u2018normality\u2019 to the uneven development and \nthe differential, often disadvantaged, histories of nations, races, communities, peoples. \nThey formulate their critical revisions around issues of cultural difference, social \nauthority, and political discrimination in order to reveal the antagonistic and ambivalent \nmoments within the \u2018rationalizations\u2019 of modernity\u2026the postcolonial project, at the \nmost general theoretical level, seeks to explore those social pathologies \u2018loss of \nmeaning, conditions of anomie\u2019 \u2013 that no longer simply \u2018cluster around class \nantagonism, [but] break up into widely scattered historical contingencies\u2019. (Bhabha, \n1994, p. 171) \n \nBhabha adds two further vital points to this commentary. Firstly: \u2018it is from those who \nhave suffered the sentence of history \u2013 subjugation, domination, diaspora, \ndisplacement \u2013 that we learn our most enduring lessons for living and thinking\u2026\u2019 \n(1994, p. 172). Furthermore:  \n \n[T]he affective experience of social marginality \u2013 as it emerges in non-canonical \ncultural forms - transforms of critical strategies. It forces us to\u2026engage with culture as \nan uneven, incomplete production of meaning and value, often composed of \nincommensurable demands and practices, produced in the act of social survival. \n(Bhabha, 1994, p. 172) \n \nWith these points in mind - the revitalization of critique by those who have suffered \nthe subjugation of colonialism, and culture as a tactic of \u2018social survival\u2019 - we turn our \nattentions to Frantz Fanon and to those aspects of his more psychological writings that \nhold the greatest rejuvenating potential for critical psychology. \n \n \nFanon, \u2018psychopolitics\u2019 \n \nOne way of grasping the importance of the inaugural moment of Fanon\u2019s critique in \nBlack Skin, White Masks is by understanding that what Fanon was doing was to \nformulate a kind of critique where, to a very large extent, one did not properly exist, \nand where no pre-existing forms would do.2 If there is a fact that Fanon\u2019s most vital \nwritings impress upon us, it is that the violence of the colonial encounter is absolutely \nunprecedented, that the colonial moment of epistemic, cultural, psychic and physical \nviolence makes for a unique kind of historical trauma. Bhabha (1987) puts this well \nwhen he suggests that the force of Fanon\u2019s vision comes from the tradition of the \noppressed, the language of revolutionary awareness, adding, furthermore, that \u2018there \nis no master narrative or realist perspective that provides a background of social and \nhistorical facts against which emerge the problems of the individual or collective \npsyche [in the colonial encounter]\u2019 (1986, p. ii). Bhabha here is expanding on Fanon, \nwho himself is drawing on Mannoni (1990) \u2013 although in changed form: despite what \nFanon gains from him, Mannoni is an early target of Black Skin, White Masks - who \ninitially made the suggestion that the colonial world seems not only pathological, but \npathogenic by the severity of the relations of domination that it incurred, by its \nfunction as a surface of fantasy, ambivalence, hatred and desire. The argument as such \nis that something like a psychological, and indeed psychoanalytic register, is \nindispensable both in properly formulating these violence \u2013 grasping them \nconceptually, analytically - and as a rudimentary basis for their critique. Fanon opens \nBlack Skin, White Masks by insisting on the necessity of a psychoanalytic account of \nracism and colonial violence, even if such a conceptualization need ultimately take its \nplace alongside, and in conjunction with, analyses of the socio-political and economic \nfactors. \n Perhaps Fanon\u2019s greatest source of originality as a theorist, as McCulloch \n(1983) has argued, is to be found in his combination of psychology and politics, his \nattempts, for example, to approach the problems of national liberation and social \nrevolution from the perspective of psychopathology, and the problems of personal \nidentity through a sustained focus on the violence of the colonial encounter. \nMcCulloch:  \n \nAll of Fanon\u2019s work falls into that category where the sciences of personality and the \nsciences of society converge\u2026[in an attempt] to traverse the distance between an \nanalysis of the consciousness of the individual and the analysis of social institutions. \n(1983, pp. 206-207) \n \nLabeau (1998) has recently discussed Fanon\u2019s work in view of the notion of a \n\u2018psychopolitics\u2019 which I understand, building on McCulloch\u2019s conceptualization, as a \nkind of to and fro movement of registers, of the political into the psychological, and, \njust as importantly, of the psychological into the political. (Or, as frequently in Fanon, \nthe \u2018to and fro\u2019 of questions of racialized power and how they might be \npsychoanalytically formulated). In this vein we might think the project of \npsychopolitics as the critical movement between the socio-political and the \npsychological, each of which becomes a means of critiquing the other. We have then \nan explicit means of the politicization of the psychological. This idea provides us with \na useful frame to think the \u2018critical psychology\u2019 of Fanon, Biko and Bhabha. Indeed, \nsuch a politicization can take at least three related forms. It may refer to the critical \nprocess whereby we place a series of ostensibly psychological concerns and concepts \nwithin the register of the political and thereby show up the extent to which human \npsychology is intimately linked to, and in some ways conditioned or limited by, the \nsocio-political and historical forces of its situation. Fanon\u2019s work is certainly \nemblematic of this trend; his refutation of Mannoni\u2019s orthodox psychoanalytic \ninterpretation of the dreams of colonized Malagasy subjects is a case in point. (In one \nparticularly memorable instance he remarks \u2018The rifle [in the dream of a Malagasy \nman] is not a penis but a genuine rifle, model Lebel 1916\u2019 (1986, p. 106)).  \nLikewise, such a politicization may refer to the critical process whereby \npsychological concepts, explanations and even modes of experience are employed to \ndescribe and illustrate the workings of power. Fanon\u2019s work again makes for a \nbenchmark here, although Bhabha\u2019s work perhaps extends this mandate, intent as it is \non detailing, with reference to a psychoanalytic vocabulary, something like the \nvicissitudes of colonial power and its resistances. The critical hope here is that by \nbeing able to analyze the political in such a psychological way, one might be able to \nthink strategically about how best to intervene within the life of power. Extending this \nidea, (thirdly) one might suggest that we can put certain forms of psychology to actual \npolitical work, that we can use both the concepts and understandings of psychology, \nand the actual terms of psychological experience, as a means of consolidating \nresistances to power. This, in many ways, is Biko\u2019s (1978) strategy: the conditional \nuse of certain psychological concepts as a basis for solidarity and resistance to power. \n Returning our focus to Fanon: by examining the debilitating personality and \nidentity effects of trying to understand oneself, as a black subject within the system of \nvalues of white or European culture \u2013 the phenomena of a \u2018white mask psychology\u2019 \nsuch as socially-induced \u2018inferiority complexes\u2019, practices of \u2018lactification\u2019, the \nneurotic compulsion to be white, etc. - Fanon shows how that what might otherwise \nbe understood within a purely psychological framework is far better explained in \npolitical terms, that is, with reference to understandings of racialized power, colonial \nviolence and cultural subordination. In this respect one witnesses in Fanon an \nastonishing blend of theoretical figures, a kind of lateral movement across \npsychoanalytic, Marxist, existential, psychiatric and literary modes of \nconceptualization, all put to use as means of expressing, with difficulty and \nformidable theoretical complexity, something of the identity-violence of colonial \ndispossession. The key problematic that Fanon is concerned with here \u2013 echoing in \nmany ways the notion of \u2018double consciousness\u2019 as articulated in both earlier and later \ntheorists of racism (I mean here Du Bois (1989) and Gilroy (1994) respectively) - is \nthat of being the subject of cultural oppression\/racism in which one is incessantly fed \nwith cultural values and understandings which are hostile, devaluating of myself and \nmy culture.  \nThe colonized subject (or, in Fanon\u2019s terms, the native)  hence exists in what \nSartre (1990) referred to in the preface to Fanon\u2019s Wretched of the Earth as the state \nof a \u2018nervous condition\u2019, an anxious and agitated state (speaking both politically and \npsychologically) in which one possess little or no cultural resources of one\u2019s own, \nbecause they have been eradicated by the cultural imperialism of the colonizer. \nFanon\u2019s attempt is to impart to his readers a sense of what this might mean, an \nawareness not only of the affects of the continual dissonance, within the colonized \nsubject, between ego and culture, self and society, but also the inevitability of coming \nto think and act subjectively as white, of experiencing oneself as a \u2018phobic object\u2019, \nand thus of hate coming both from without and from within, as Lebeau (1998) puts it. \nThis is a lesson very much at the basis of postcolonial critique, a continual awareness \nof the dislocation between the ideals, the norms of the valorised Western culture, and \nthose of the dominated culture, which comes to be the demoted other of all of these \nvalues. This constant and recurring slippage is properly pathogenic for Fanon, at least \nin the sense that it causes a deeply-rooted sense of inferiority, a constantly \nproblematized sense of identity which is split and at war with itself, causing \n\u2018pathologies of liberty\u2019 as Fanon (1990) calls them. 3 \nPerhaps the key passage of Fanon\u2019s \u2018psychopolitics\u2019 is the famous encounter \nwith the white child on a train that \u2018materializes\u2019 psychological objectification into a \nfar more corporeal kind of violence. The racial objectification Fanon suffers at the \nhands of the white child (\u2018\u201cLook, a Negro!\u201d\u2026\u201cMama, see the Negro! I\u2019m \nfrightened!\u201d Frightened! Frightened!\u2019 (1986, p. 112)), is that of a crushing objecthood \nbeneath the white gaze which dissipates his subjectivity, along with his ability to \nrepresent himself. Fanon describes it as an \u2018amputation, an excision, a haemorrhage \nthat splatter[s] my body with black blood\u2019 (1986, p. 112). This metaphoric conversion \nof psychic assault into the terms of bodily brutality makes apparent the violence - \nindeed the trauma - of seemingly minor (and non-physical) incidents of colonial \nracism. More to the point perhaps, it speaks of a materialist psychology, by which I \nmean to suggest that it unconventionally links the domain of psychological action to a \nworld of concrete and material effects. This is a point of some importance, so I should \nbe as clear as possible: this materialist psychology appears to disobey the disciplinary \ninjunction to focus on the sphere of pure psychology alone. In so doing, it calls \nattention to how purist forms of psychology abstract pressing political contexts out of \nconsideration or analysis. Material, institutional and indeed physical relations of force \nthat in fact condition and underwrite psychological existence in colonial environments \nare often as a result ruled out of analytic contention. 4 \nA similar example of how certain psychological effects are put into a relation \nwith the material world, of how the psychic mutilations of colonialism cannot simply \nbe \u2018psychologized away\u2019, or made reducible to an \u2018apolitical\u2019 frame of analysis, \ncomes from Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire (1972) who speaks of colonialism in the following terms: \u2018I \nam talking of millions of men who have been skilfully infected with fear, inferiority \ncomplexes, trepidation, servility, despair, debasement\u2019 (cited in Fanon, 1986, p. 14). \nFanon\u2019s linking of psychology and politics is at its most forceful here, in his \nunderstanding of colonialism as not only a means of appropriating land and territory, \nbut of appropriating culture and history themselves, that is, as a way of appropriating \nthe means and resources of identity, and hence affecting powerful forms psychic \ndistress and damage. The colonization of a land, its people, its culture, is also, in short, \nis a \u2018colonizing of the mind\u2019, in Ngugi wa Thing\u2019o\u2019s (1986) famous phrase. In similar \nterms, Bulhan (1979, 1985) argues, rearticulating Fanon: \u2018the uprooting of psyches \nfrom their culture to their insertion into another, in which the basic values [are] \nprowhite and antiblack, elicit[s] a victimization difficult to quantify, but very \nmassive\u2019 (Bulhan, 1985, p. 189).   \n \n \nThe psychological analysis of racism \n \nNot only does Fanon bring politics into psychology, he also, manages the reverse, of \nbringing psychology into politics. He does this by analyzing racism through a series \nof psychoanalytic conceptualizations that usefully dramatize the logic and workings \nof colonial power. We find reference in Black Skin, White Masks to a succession of \npsychoanalytic theorists, Freud, Jung, Adler, Lacan, Mannoni are each utilized, even \nif certain of these (Jung and Mannoni) are reviled in the process. A rich \npsychoanalytic vocabulary of concepts emerges: the \u2018neurosis of blackness\u2019 or dream \nof turning white (\u2018What does the black man want?\u2026The black man wants to be \nwhite\u2019 (1986, pp. 8-9)), the racial imago, the mirror-stage as drama of racial \ndifference, the idea of a \u2018European collective unconscious\u2019, the conceptualization of \nthe Negro as phobogenic object, whiteness as \u2018metaphysics of positivity\u2019, not to \nmention the mechanisms of projection, ambivalence and scapegoating, each viewed as \ncomponent procedures of racist ideation. The objectives of this psychological \nconceptualization is to subject the \u2018vicissitudes of racism\u2019 to critique, to investigate \ntheir procedures, in the hope that one might interrupt its functioning. One might view \nthis as Fanon\u2019s analysis of the psychic life of the colonial encounter. Because of \nlimitations of space I will not discuss this vital element of Fanon\u2019s work in more \ndetail here, although I have done so elsewhere (Hook, 2004b) (see also McCulloch \n1983; Gibson, 2003). \nFanon also considers how we might explore psychological concepts as \nconceptual instruments of a progressive politics. Indeed, Fanon had intended Black \nSkin, White Masks to serve as a kind of \u2018instrument of liberation\u2019 (Macey, 2000); the \noriginal intended title of the book was \u2018Essay for the dis-alienation of the black man\u2019 \n(Julien, 1995). Many of the book\u2019s chief ideas - the sociogenetic approach to \npsychopathology, the conviction of madness as organically linked to the situation of \nrepression, as just two examples - are orientated exactly toward making change \npossible. As psychoanalysis hopes to free the neurotic from his or her personal \nneurosis, so this text was intended, as Adams (1970) emphasizes, to offer the reader a \nmeans of alleviating forms of racial neurosis. Here of course one should not neglect \nthe practical elements of Fanon\u2019s own clinical practice, his attempts at transforming \nconditions of psychiatric internment (well detailed by Bulhan, 1980a, 1999; Caute, \n1970; McCulloch, 1983). The psychological dimension of political existence must as \nsuch be addressed, it must take its place alongside economic and social, indeed \nrevolutionary struggles, and must do so as a matter of urgency (Bulhan, 1985). Before \none can create the conditions for solidarity among the oppressed, intimates Fanon \n(1968) \u2013 anticipating the standpoint of Steve Biko and Black Consciousness to follow \n- there must first be the destruction of the subjective aspect of black oppression. \nThis is the particular complexity of Fanon\u2019s psychopolitics: an awareness that \npsychology does feature in politics, and that we cannot reduce psychology away \u2013 \nreified and ideologically-skewed as many of its primary concepts may well be \u2013 or \nallow it to fall out of the conceptual vocabulary of critical psychology. Those forms of \ncritical psychology content to critique the discourse and functioning of psychology \nfrom afar, abstaining themselves from the psychological, as it were, seem to manage \nonly half of Fanon\u2019s call for critique. It is not enough, to reiterate, to conceptualize \nhow politics impacts psychology; we need an awareness also of the psychological \nworking of power, of how subjectivity repeats, reiterates, reinforces the political. \nAfter all, these two categories are inseparably joined: just as it is not good enough to \nengage psychology without a consideration of power, so it is insufficient to engage \ncertain forms of power, like that of racism, without a consideration of its \u2018conditions \nof subjectivity\u2019. And indeed, the case of racism is instrumental here. As Fanon makes \nquite clear, to adopt a psychological\/psychoanalytic engagement with racism is not \nnecessarily to imply that the denigratory imaging of blackness \u2013 to take one example \nthat he (1986) uses - is in any way a natural, ahistorical, predisposed quality of \ncerebral matter, as it seems is the implication of Jungian psychoanalysis. To adopt a \npsychological engagement with racism is though to assert the regularity, the \ndeployable frequency of such depictions; it is to assert that racist images of this sort \nfeature strongly in the psychical phenomena of the minds of racist\/colonial societies. \nFanon\u2019s point is that such images circulate widely, indeed penetratively, across the \naffective and psychic channels of society, propping up the contents of individual \ndreams, phobias, symptoms, neuroses of colonizer and colonized alike, taking root at \nthe micro-political level of individual psychology, although without being simply \nreducible to this psychic level of realization.  \nIt remains imperative as such to understand how psychic structure, how details \nof individual psychology and psychical mechanisms may recapitulate political \nstructure, to acknowledge that neither political nor psychical structure on its own \nmakes for a sufficient basis of analysis. This, admittedly, is a point of critique that \nholds better for certain trends within critical psychology than for others. I have in \nmind here particularly those trends of analysis that focus more on grappling with the \nideological impact of psychology as itself a powerful discourse than with exploring \nthe substantive psychological, affective or psychical underpinnings of a political \nphenomena like that of racism. In certain instances this is with good cause, the cause \nbeing wariness towards the ideological bent of much psychological language, a \nreticence towards slipping into the apparent individualism, reductionism and de-\npoliticization it so typically entails. A number of important texts from within the \nambit of critical psychology share this characteristic, typically those which centralize \nthe role of post-structural theory, or, much by the same token, that adopt a \npredominantly social constructionist orientation towards analysis (see for example \nvolumes edited by Gergen & Grauffman, 1996; Levett, Kottler, Burman & Parker, \n1997; Nightingale & Cromby, 1999; Parker & Shotter, 1990; Shotter & Gergen, \n1989). Also emblematic of this trend are Edwards & Potter, 1992; Gergen, 1999, \n2001; Harre & Stearns, 1995; Parker, Georgaca, Harper, McLaughlin & Stowell \nSmith, 1995). \nThis is not always the case though; the work of Frosh (1989, 2002a) makes for \na strong counterpoint here. While firm that a socio-political and often discursive \naccount of racism is necessary - and that a psychological account should by no means \nact as a substitute for such a level of engagement - he nonetheless insists that both \nsuch forms of analysis are vital. We need an approach that is able to properly engage \nthe affective and psychological components of the political phenomenon of racism. \nWe need explain how such phenomena \u2018become\u2026an integral part of the emotional \nlife of the racist individual\u2026the emotional and ideological intensity with which \n[racist] group identity [is] constructed\u2019 (Frosh, 1989, p. 215). (In this connection see \nalso Frosh, 2001, 2002b, 2002c; Frosh, Phoenix & Pattman, 2002).  \nNone of this is of course to suggest that the discipline of psychology has \nprovided us with a set of trustworthy instruments; historically it most certainly has \nnot. (For discussion of the role of psychology in the perpetuation of racism (as a case \nin point), see Foster, 1991, 1993; on the topic of psychological instrumentation and \npower, see Rose, 1991, 1996). As such it is necessary to maintain a certain distance \nand critical mistrust toward many of the conceptual tools that the discipline at our \ndisposal. However, in so far as the over-arching critical agenda remains that of \nanalyzing and disrupting the functioning of power, psychological forms of analysis \nand critique remain crucial. It is useful here to refer to Foster (1991), who argues that \n\u2018Psychology as a product of modernity has in the main been a productive servant in \nthe reproduction of major forms of inequality and oppression \u2013 patriarchy, racism, \nclass domination\u2019 (p. 347). Nevertheless, whilst scathing towards the \u2018postivistic, \nindividualistic, politically conservative roots\u2019 of psychology (p. 347) he nonetheless \nholds out hope for the emancipatory potential of the discipline, presenting it, at least \nin part, as a resource of liberation (Foster, 2004) (as do Lykes, Banuazizi, Liem & \nMorris, 1996 and Martin-Baro, 1994). \nI should be clear here: textual or discursive models of analysis have made vital \nand often innovative contributions to the critique and understanding of racism, as a \nseries of recent studies drawn from the South African context demonstrates (Dixon & \nDurrheim, 2000; Dixon & Reicher, 1997; Dixon, Reicher & Foster, 1997; Durrheim, \n1997; Durrheim and Dixon, 2001). Indeed, discursive or social constructionist modes \nof analysis have certainly provided us with a \u2018replacement vocabulary\u2019, alternative \nmodes of conceptualization through which aspects of racist behavior may be \nformulated beyond the constraints of purely psychological terms of reference. This, in \nmany ways, is a benefit. The question remains however whether a crucial \npsychological component is neglected by such accounts, and whether, as a result, their \nexplanatory efficacy suffers. Let me give an example that continues the above \nconcern with racism. The above approaches to racism all leave unexamined the \npsychical question of desire. Now, for both Fanon (1986) and Bhabha (1994), such an \nomission must undermine the efficacy of the critique of racism in question. No \nanalysis of (post)-colonial racism can, for these theorists, be sufficient unless it \ninvolves consideration of issues of fantasy, sexuality, ambivalence and desire, each of \nwhich is taken as an integral part of the radical asymmetries of power and privilege, \nwhich characterize such contexts. This is not to say that psychoanalysis is being \npositioned as the privileged mode of explanation, nor is to demand a dogmatic loyalty \nto its discourse; both theorists evoke a hybrid bricolage of concepts and explanatory \nvehicles in their approach to racism. It is though to suggest that there is something \nindispensable about a psychological\/psychoanalytic contribution to the understanding \nof racism. Bhabha (1986) addresses a similar point when he refers to the failure of the \nstandard array of critical systems (narratives that is, of economic necessity, historical \nprogress, critical humanism) regards understanding the politics of race. The psychical \naffectivity of racism, in his (1986) estimation, elides all such attempts at explanation.  \nThere is an important point of contextualization to be added here: Bhabha is \nnot antagonistic towards post-structural or discursive modes of analysis; he views \nthese as necessary compliments to his particular brand of psychoanalytic theorizing. \nBhabha views himself as extending those attempts, like that of Edward Said\u2019s \nOrientalism (1978), to understand formations of colonial knowledge and\/or racism in \npredominantly discursive terms. Indeed, the latter text provides the initial co-ordinates \nfor Bhabha\u2019s own project of postcolonial critique; the challenge of conceptualizing \nthe structure and functioning of colonial discourse remains an imperative across his \nwork. However, the knowledge and power of colonial discourse, like the functional \nutility of racism - and this is the vital point - cannot for Bhabha (1994), be resolved in \npurely epistemological terms. Part of the resulting corrective that Bhabha aims to \ndeliver to Said, as Moore-Gilbert (1997) notes \u2013 and this is the point we need apply to \nthe critique of critical psychology - is the awareness that the utilization of discourse is \nnot unaffected by psychical dynamics of desire and ambivalence. 5  \nThese concerns with the psychological\/psychical dimension of racism mirrors \nthose of Lane (1998), Shepherdson (1998), \u017di\u017eek (1998) all of whom argue that \ndiscursive\/ideological approaches appear unable to properly explain certain of \nracism\u2019s most vital characteristics: its affective charge, its libidinal currents, the \nracist\u2019s formidable investment in their own racial hatred, the racist\u2019s pleasure-in-\nhating. Indeed, failing to engage the personalized affectivity of racism, the \nindividualized psychical mechanics that underscore its discursive functioning leaves \nus curiously unable to account for the persistence of racism, its pronounced \nirrationality, its compulsive qualities, the visceral quality of its hatred, its continuous, \nseemingly repetitive nature. To speak in more grounded terms: we need strong \npsychological accounts of racism if racism is to be adequately examined, confronted \nand hence contested. The question that we need confront certain trends within critical \npsychology with is whether racism as a psychological or psychical phenomena has \nnot been able to slip from their grasp, ironically enough, because critical psychology \nhas not permitted itself access enough to, reasonable enough purchase upon, the \nconceptual domain of the psychological. Indeed, by neglecting the \npsychological\/psychical as a critical means of explanation and\/or critique, critical \npsychology seems to have undermined its own critical efficacy regards the \nphenomena of racism.  Oddly, the focus on the turn to text that has proved so central \nto its efforts in the last decade might represent its most pronounced critical limitation, \nespecially so if these efforts have become largely limited to the discursive as its \nconceptual and methodological analytical mode of choice, to conceiving of racism as \nan issue of representation, rhetorical strategy, significatory practice, etc. \nIt is again necessary here to qualify the terms of my argument, for, indeed, the \nearly turn to discourse on the part of some critical psychologists was undertaken in \nconjunction with an interest in psychoanalytic concepts. The interest in subjectivity \nand desire is outlined in the landmark Changing the Subject (Henriques et al, 1984), \nwhich, in this respect can be contrasted with another influential work from the same \nperiod, Potter & Wetherell\u2019s (1987) Discourse and Social Psychology. The tension \nbetween psychoanalytic and discursive approaches has in certain instances fuelled \ndebate in the field. Hollway & Jefferson, for example, have focused on utilizing \ncertain psychoanalytic concepts to the task of critical social research (2000) (although \none frequently has the suspicion that this is a somewhat domesticated version of \npsychoanalysis). The work of Parker is likewise pertinent; an engagement with \npsychoanalysis has consistently featured in his key works on critical psychology \n(1997, 2002); indeed he has treated it as a fundamental resource for the practice of \ncritical psychology (1999). As true as this is, one might nevertheless contend that \npsychoanalytic modes of analysis are, often, as is to my mind the case in the above \nexamples, accommodated only through a discursive frame, provisionally engaged, as \none might put it, through the filter of social constructionism. I should, furthermore, be \nmore specific here. My concerns are not simply to signal a greater need for \nrapprochement between discursive and psychoanalytic strands of critical psychology. \nThis would be in many ways a redundant objective (although one might remark that \npsychoanalytic conceptualizations need not continually be restrained through an over-\narching adherence to post-structural theory). Likewise, my objective is not simply to \ncomment on discursive approaches to racism. My objective, in a more general way, is \nto call attention to the need to utilize psychological modes of critique and \nconceptualization (psychoanalysis included, but by no means exclusively) toward the \npolitical and emancipatory objectives of critical psychology.  \nI might refocus the argument in the following way: we need beware the \nshortcomings of the conflation of \u2018the critical\u2019 with \u2018the discursive\u2019, which is perhaps \nalso the difference between a critical psychology preoccupied with an external \nscrutiny of psychology, seeking to focus its critical energies on problematizing the \nplace of psychological explanations in patterns of power and ideology (Parker, 2002), \nand the objectives of a critical liberation psychology, which, to quote Foster \n \ninvolves questions of the psychological processes, dynamics, capacities and practices \nthrough which people may achieve emancipation, freedom, liberation and escape from \nparticular power structures of oppression and exploitation. (2004, p. 541) \n \nThis distinction is exasperated in the context of developing societies like that of \nSouthern Africa, where, as Van Vlaenderen and Neves (2004a) argue \n \ncritical psychology needs to move beyond the applied level of ideological critique to \nconsider ways of refashioning itself so as to serve an emancipatory and socially \ntransformative agenda that is properly responsive to the demands of\u2026society. (p. 445)  \n \nPerhaps the crucial point here \u2013 which the comparison with postcolonial forms of \ncriticism helps make very clear \u2013 is that critical psychology should be concerned both \nwith critiquing oppressive uses of psychology and with enabling potentially \ntransformative forms of practice and\/or analysis that disrupt imbalances of power \ntoward the objective of social equality. It is with this focus on the liberatory or \nemancipatory potential of psychology in the African context, that we now turn to the \nwritings of Steve Biko. \n \n \nBiko, Black Consciousness \n \nBiko provides another way of operationalizing a politics of the psyche, of drawing \nelements of a psychological vocabulary into a set of political agendas. As mentioned \nabove, Biko exemplifies that line of psychopolitics that utilizes the terms of \npsychological experience as means of consolidating resistances to power, and in this \nrespect he notably extends Fanon. As is the case with Fanon, and as bears repetition, \nthe crucial psychopolitical component of Biko\u2019s writings - in particular Black \nConsciousness\u2019s emphasis on a psychological politics of resistance - seems \nsurprisingly undervalued in critical psychology. Biko\u2019s is a turning \u2018inside out\u2019 of the \npsychological into the political, and an \u2018outside in\u2019 of the political into the domain of \npsychological experience.  \n A few words of introduction are important here. There are elements of Biko\u2019s \nwriting which may appear unfashionable today, his reference to seemingly static and \nidealized notions of an African culture seemingly lost and past, for example, or the \napparent essentializing bent of an identity politics which may seem rigid, \nunaccommodating of dissent or internal difference, unable to adequately \naccommodate nuances of cultural hybridity, and so on. Against the tendency to \ndismiss Biko\u2019s writings as of pertinence only to their specific time and place, I argue \nfor their continued vitality. More than this, I would argue that the consigning of \nBiko\u2019s writing to a discrete time and place of relevance is to do an injustice to both \nwriter and ideas. There seems to me an imperative to re-read Biko, perhaps in view of \nSaid\u2019s (1993) suggestion of contrapuntal reading, as way of evaluating the text in and \nout of its history, and putting it to work against a new set of political priorities. \nBiko\u2019s view of Black Consciousness 6 called for the psychological and cultural \nliberation of the black mind as the prerequisite for political freedom \u2013 in his own \nwords: \u2018mental emancipation as a precondition to political emancipation\u2019 (Biko, cited \nin Arnold, 1972, p. xx). What is in question here is exactly \u2018the psychological battle \nfor the minds of the black people\u2019 (Arnold, 1979, xxi). The context to this political \nproject was 300 years of colonial rule, which had \u2018disfigured\u2019 the African past, and all \nbut destroyed black \u2018imagination\u2019 (Biko, 1978). The mutilation of the black psyche, \nand, correspondingly, the systematic marginalization of those cultural resources \nthrough which it had traditionally attained autonomy and vitality, had been extreme. \nAs such, the challenge of BC was to reverse the colonial imprint of a negative, racist \nself-image, and to replace it with a positive, more self-affirming \u2013 if not angry - forms \nof black identity and history. Importantly, \u2018blackness\u2019 here \u2013 and this is crucial point, \nparticularly against contentions of essentialism - was not simply an issue of skin \ncolor, but was a form of solidarity, a collective form of hope and security, a way for \nblack people to \u2018build up their humanity\u2019 (Biko, cited in Arnold, 1979 p. 34).  \nEmphatically then, we are not speaking here of a unified psychology of black \nessences, but a psychology based on disruptive historical experiences of oppression \nand marginality. This is reflected in Biko\u2019s definition of blacks as \u2018those who are by \nlaw or tradition politically, economically, and socially discriminated against as a \ngroup in South African society, and [who] identify themselves as a unit in the struggle \ntowards the realization of their aspirations\u2019 (1998, p. 360).  In opposition to self-\nnegating ways of thinking thus, Biko called for solidarity amongst those that apartheid \nlabeled \u2018non-white\u2019, emphasizing the need for oppressed groups to identify with \nthemselves and to advance the liberation struggle on this basis. \u2018Blackness\u2019 as a kind \nof politics was hence, as Arnold (1979) argues, a deliberate attempt to lay the \nintellectual and emotive base for ultimate political unity between Apartheid\u2019s others. \nIt is on this basis that Biko (1978) took up the mandate to emphasize the role of a \nhealthy subjectivity, of a robust, proud and positive self-image, as a means of \nempowering one\u2019s self to resist oppression.  \n Importantly then, we need to read Biko\u2019s Black Consciousness as a politics of \nsolidarity, which celebrates blackness and concomitant notions of identity and culture \naround this political objective, of liberation, not simply as ends in themselves. 7  Two \npoints of historical contextualization are pertinent here. We need bear in mind, firstly, \nthat apartheid\u2019s success was in many ways due to its divide-and-conquer approach \nwhich systematically cultivated in-group violence (often on ethnic lines) among the \nblack populous, preventing - as an absolute strategic imperative - the forging of any \nover-arching unity, class (or here, race) consciousness, any form of solidarity among \nthe oppressed masses, who, as is well known, vastly outnumbered the white minority \n(Lapping, 1987). Hence Black Consciousness\u2019s prioritization of a robust and unifying \ngroup identity of resistance. Secondly, we need keep sight of the extreme racism \ncharacteristic of apartheid, a system not merely of \ndepersonalization\/desubjectivization, but of violent racial objectification and \ndehumanization.  \nThis radical depersonalization is an important point to bear in mind, especially \nagainst those forms of critique, such as that made by Butchart (1997) (following \nFoucault), that Black Consciousness might itself be classified as a self-subjectivizing \nsystem that manufactured \u2018a new and essentialist African personality\u2026wherein each \nAfrican was his own overseer, exercising surveillance over and against himself\u2019 (p. \n104). Despite that Black Consciousness need not necessarily be essentialist (the basis \nfor solidarity is a communality of oppression, not, as in negritude, that of an African \nessence), one also needs bear in mind here that Foucault\u2019s (1977) critique of self-\nsubjectivizing modes of power occurs within the context of liberal, democratic \nWestern societies, and in reference to individualized, personalized subjects, who \nconstitute a very different set of referents to the dehumanized racial \u2018objects\u2019 of black \nmen and women in apartheid. In terms of the latter, subjectification is itself a \nprogressive political, and properly liberatory aim, particularly so if it entails a \ndefinition and programme of identity focused in deliberate opposition to the practices, \nvalues, norms and ideology of the state. \nBiko\u2019s attempts to raise to the level of humanity of the racially objectified black \nsubject should not as such be taken as a kind of bland moral humanism. Rather such \nattempts need to be understood as part of the attempt to respond to a level of utter \ndepersonalization and objectification - perhaps difficult to understand by those who \nhave never experienced such a radical disempowerment \u2013 that is, as part of a political \nproject that acknowledges the degree to which negative forms of identity can be \ncentral features of oppression. Biko explains this well in his declaration that \n \nReduced to an obliging shell [the black subject]\u2026looks with awe at the white power \nstructure and accepts what he [sic] regards as the \u2018inevitable position\u2019\u2026The black man \nhas become a shadow, completely defeated, drowning in his own misery, a slave and \nox, bearing the yoke of oppression with sheepish timidity. (Biko, cited in Lapping, \n1984, p. 158) \n \nCrucial again here is an awareness of the double direction of racism, of the fact that \nracism may be sourced, as Fanon (1986) had argued, both inside and outside the racial \nsubject. The point here is that the internalization of self-depreciating identities is a key \npolitical tactic of oppression. Hence Biko\u2019s remark that \u2018the most potent weapon in \nthe hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed\u2019 (in Arnold, 1979, p. xx). This \nof course is a remark that also emphasizes the role, and the potential, of identity in \npolitical resistance. \nA key strategy of Black Consciousness was conscientization. Conscientization, \nas was the case for Paulo Freire (1990), involves what Biko referred to as protest talk, \ntalk about circumstances of oppression that links the everyday conditions of \nexperience to a set of political antecedents. Here then the turning inside out of the \npsychological into the political, and an \u2018outside in\u2019 of the political into psychological \nexperience, as mentioned above. Conscientization involved the repeated attempt to \n \nmake reference to the conditions of the Black man [sic] and the conditions in which the \nBlack man lives. We try to get Blacks in conscientization to grapple realistically with \ntheir problems\u2026to develop what one might call an awareness, a physical awareness of \ntheir situation\u2026to be able to analyze it, and to provide answers for themselves. (Biko, \nin Arnold, 1979, p.33)  \n \nLike Fanon\u2019s, Biko\u2019s was a political project which involved a profound cultural \nawareness. Indeed, the consciousness-raising of Black Consciousness also involves a \ncomponent of historical redress:  \n \nBlack Consciousness [has]\u2026to do with correcting false images of ourselves in terms of \nculture, education, religion, and economics\u2026There is always an interplay between the \nhistory of a people\u2026the past, and their faith in themselves and hopes for their future. \nWe are aware of the terrible role played by our education and religion in creating \namongst us a false understanding of ourselves. (Biko, 1998, p. 363) \n \nThis process of \u2018correcting false images\u2019 must be undertaken by black men and \nwomen themselves \u2018Whites\u2026from the outside\u2026can never extract and analyze the \nethos in the black community\u2019 (Biko, 1978, p. 363). This should not be taken as \nrepresenting a segregationist viewpoint, rather Biko\u2019s (1998) concern is that blacks \nshould not always be interpreted by whites. 8 \nBlack Consciousness then, to reiterate, emerges out of a twofold objective: an \nawareness of the imperative of generating political solidarity amongst the oppressed, \nand the need to disrupt and halt the massive and systematic depersonalization of so-\ncalled \u2018non-whites\u2019 in apartheid. Each of these objectives finds their place within the \nlarger political goal of black liberation and independence from oppression, the over-\nriding importance of which Biko is quick to stress: \n \nOne must immediately dispel the thought that Black Consciousness is merely a \nmethodology or a means to an end. What Black Consciousness seeks to do is to \nproduce at the output end of the process real black people who do not regards \nthemselves as appendages to white society\u2026it will always be a lie to accept white \nvalues as necessarily the best. (1978, p. 362) \n \nBiko hence utilizes the trope of the psychological as a strategic and, importantly, \nconditional mode of doing politics, without ultimately, like Fanon, allowing it too \nmuch of its own autonomy. To be clear: by the \u2018trope\u2019 of the psychological I mean to \nrefer both to psychology\u2019s array of explanatory concepts, and to its characteristic \npreoccupation of reflection on lived experience and identity. This is a utilization - \nconsistent in certain ways with how Fanon and Bhabha press the domain of the \npsychological into kinds of political work - that itself poses a series of interesting \nquestions: What is it about such psychological formulations which makes them so \nefficacious in the writing of critique? What are the particular properties that the \nlanguage of psychology potentially lends to a discourse of dissent, to the project of \npracticing, indeed, experiencing, resistance?  \nIt is of course essential here that we resist codifying Biko\u2019s politics into \nexclusively psychological terms of explanation. (Much of the same problem arises in \nconnection with Fanon\u2019s use of the notion of alienation, which in its \neconomic\/materialist\/Marxist resonances cannot be reduced simply into a \npsychological kind of understanding (see Bulhan, 1985; Zahar, 1969). Indeed, as \nMnguni (2000) points out, the body of literature on Black Consciousness should not \nbe seen as for the most chiefly psychologically orientated; it utilizes a spread of \nhistorical, cultural and even theological revitalizations of black identity. Kros (1999) \nis helpful here. The rehabilitation of identity and history that Black Conscious aims at \nis not, she (1999) argues, to be understood as an individualized exercise in positive \nthinking, a building of self-esteem. The determination of the black man or woman to \nrise and attain the envisaged self is clearly not to be reduced to a kind of self-help \npsychology (Kros, 1999). The point is exactly to connect psychological kinds of \nconceptualization and modes of reflection to a far larger political projects, not to keep \nthe two spheres separate, hence the notion of the psycho-political, the idea of political \nconsciousness. To reiterate: the drive to overcome political oppression through \ncollective effort is not simply a psychological \u2018formula of identity\u2019 (Kros, 1999) - the \nproject here is exactly that of political identity: the use of identity as a kind of weapon, \nas political instrument. The psychological means of articulating this envisaged self are \nhence useful precisely inasmuch as they further this end, and not beyond. \nBiko\u2019s writing provides an invaluable perspective on the potential critical and \npolitical utilization of a discourse of the psychological. One of the lessons we can take \nfrom Biko is that of the importance and the means, of thinking a psychology of \ndissidence and resistance, indeed, of applying our conceptual efforts within \npsychology toward these ends. In fact, his work gives rise to a number of questions \nconcerning the political utility of the psychological. Why the continued return to a \nlanguage of psychology (as in Fanon, Bhabha and Biko) to formulate resistance? \nWhat is it about this conceptual domain that makes it so crucial a vocabulary of \nopposition? Here then is a prospective question for a future critical psychology more \nwilling to engage the political value of psychological conceptualizations. \nPerhaps more trenchantly however, Biko\u2019s work demonstrates a commitment \nto resistance \u2013 indeed, it is true to say that Biko\u2019s writings begin and end with this \noverarching objective \u2013 a political centring that many social scientific and \npsychological types of discourse, critical psychology included, would find unfamiliar. \nBiko\u2019s writing, like that of Fanon, hence offers a set of \u2018social psychological\u2019 \ntheorizations that cannot be viewed apart from designs of social action. Indeed, this \nwork came into being exactly in response to immediate contexts of oppression, a \nfactor that means they do not exhibit the gap - seemingly characteristic of critical \npsychology - between intellectual analysis and practical political engagement. This \nconsideration makes the absence of Fanon and Biko from critical psychology, a \n\u2018heterogeneous process of critique\u2019 eager to align itself with political activity, more \npuzzling still. Indeed, it is via a comparison with the writings of Biko and Fanon that \none gets a sense of exactly how far from an actual politics of social change the efforts \nof particularly discursive varieties of critical psychology in fact are. (Again here it is \nimportant to draw a distinction between discursive, constructionist modes of critical \npsychology (such as that of Hepburn, 2003; Parker, 2002; Walkerdine, 2002) as \nopposed to more practically-orientated liberatory approaches to critical psychology \nwho, in line with the above, take as a priority the development of a critical \npsychology of social change (for example, see Banuazizi, 1996; Lykes, 2002, 2003; \nPrilleltensky, 2001; Prilleltensky & Austin, 2001; Van Vlaenderen & Neves, 2004a, \n2004b). \nIn commenting on the legacy of anti-colonial writings such as those of Fanon \nand Biko, Gibson notes that  \n \nWhat remains a philosophical project is how one begins to articulate the meaning of \nmass action, expand the new social consciousness derived from the cultures of \nresistance and solidarity into new directions. (1999, p. 38).  \n \nCan discursive, constructionist varieties of critical psychology realistically lay claim \nto any of these objectives, of expanding social consciousness, developing cultures of \nsolidarity or resistance, of thinking the role and meaning of mass action?  \n \n \nCritical psychology and the postcolonial: Future intersections \n \nIn drawing to a close it seems apt to return to Hayes (2001), and his suggestion that \nthe current imperative for critical psychology is that of engaging with, and developing, \na set of concepts with the ability to transcend abstract forms of analysis and point the \nway to practical political engagement, because \u2018critical psychology would \nbe...incomplete if it did not try to take on the injustices and inequalities of the world\u2019 \n(p. 47).  Concurring with Hayes, I have argued above that the contemporary turn to \ndiscourse in critical psychology has played a significant role in negating the \npsychological realm as a domain of resistance and critique. I have suggested that \npostcolonial thought offers a set of concepts through which we might transcend the \ndiscursive register of much critical psychology. In the case of Fanon and Biko one has \na set of examples of how postcolonial criticism offers a way of closing the gap \nbetween intellectual and political activity, between insular critique and the impetus to \nbroader social action. Both, furthermore, provide an impetus toward a psychology of \nresistance, a psychological means of thinking the effects of marginalization, \ndiscrimination, alterity, which moves beyond an accentuation of psychic damage, \nbeyond a \u2018rhetorics of blame\u2019, to use Said\u2019s (1993) phrase, towards a strategic \nconsolidation of \u2018psychopolitical\u2019 resources, be those communal (a solidarity of the \noppressed) or personal (a politics of everyday experience).  \nOne way of bringing together the \u2018critical psychologies\u2019 of postcolonial critics \nsuch as Fanon, Biko and Bhabha is via the notion of the psychopolitical. Here I have \nin mind a reciprocal form of critique in which we not only place the psychological \nwithin the register of the political, but, perhaps more challengingly, in which the \npolitical is also - although strategically - approached through the register of the \npsychological. What the writings of Fanon and Biko make plain in this connection is \nthe degree to which the narratives and concepts of the social psychological may be \nreformulated so as to fashion a novel discourse of resistance, one that opens up new \navenues for critique for critical psychology, on one hand, and one that affords an \ninnovative set of opportunities for the psychological investigation of the vicissitudes \nof the postcolonial, on the other.  \nIf Fanon could be said to have a \u2018lesson\u2019 for critical psychology it may well be \nthe lesson that psychology itself should not be abandoned as a means of \nconceptualizing oppression, especially not in the case of confronting racism, a \nphenomena that seems as psychical as it does political in nature. As Fanon\u2019s \npsychiatric work testifies, the micro-political level of individual psychology cannot \nsimply be ignored in projects of liberation. Fanon also (here perhaps in tandem with \nBhabha) has a lesson for a critical psychology that would ignore the psychical \ndimensions power (as in the emblematic case of racism), for those theories which rely \ntoo heavily on the \u2018discursivity\u2019 of power without engaging the psychic terrain, the \ncomplexities of desire, ambivalence, identification and sexuality that play their part in \nsuch formations of power. Biko has a lesson for a critical psychology that would \nabandon psychology as a means of thinking resistance, as an instrumental language in \nmotivating the resistance talk of conscientization. He likewise has a lesson for those \nforms of psychology which would attempt to think dissidence and resistance, but who \nhave neglected the instrumentality of identity. (The \u2018instrumentality of identity\u2019 that is \nnot in the essentialist capacity, but rather as a psychology based on historical \nexperiences of oppression and marginality). \n While this paper has focused largely on aspects of the history of race relations \nbetween and within Europe and Africa (and South Africa), the modes of critique and \nconceptualization called upon here may of course inform how one understands the \npolitics of alterity in a variety of other domains. I should emphasize this point: \npostcolonial criticism offers a new and expanding field of concepts which may be \nused as tools by psychologists attempting politically-engaged psychology in their own \nlocal spheres. The imperative this paper points to is that of exploring a set of \nintersections between critical psychological and postcolonial concerns. Such a set of \ninteractions would develop far beyond the tentative outline offered here, and may \nindeed provide the basis of an ongoing and developing project that propels the \nprospects of thinking and writing a psychology of resistance. Let me give one \n(further) speculative example before closing, the case of what one might guardedly \nrefer to as Bhabha\u2019s \u2018psychology\u2019 of doubling.  \nIn describing the effects of Bhabha\u2019s criticism one is tempted to use a visual \nmetaphor - his criticism is like the conceptual equivalent of looking into a \nkaleidoscope: it splits, doubles, fragments the objects in the view of his analysis, \ncomplexifying the terrain, continually producing fissures of ambiguity and hence \nresistance. One of Bhabha\u2019s assets as a thinker would seem to be the purchase he \ngives us on the notion of resistance, even if it is (characteristically) ambiguously \nformulated in his work, in for example, the subversions of what he calls \u2018sly civility\u2019, \nthe slippages of colonial mimicry, the doubling of the hybrid. This is the continual \nstrategy of his writing. As opposed to Edward Said whose earlier work spends much \nof its time impressing upon us the awesome discursive power of what he calls \norientalism, Bhabha endeavors to read the internal insecurities and doubts within the \npatterns and operations of colonial discourses and apparatuses of power alike. He is \ncontinually attentive to how such implementations of power open up opportunities for \ntheir own subversion (Campbell, 2000). So, to give an example, whereas Fanon \nfocuses a good deal of attention on the colonized, famously asking, via Freud, \u2018what \ndoes the black man want?\u2019, Bhabha seems concerned with balancing this attention on \nthe oppressed with an attention to the desire of the colonizer, with implicitly asking \n\u2018what does the white man want?\u2019. One of the places that this line of concern takes him \n\u2013 as part of the attempt to think the ambivalence of colonial authority and identity \u2013 is \nto a querying of the narcissistic demand of the colonial forces of oppression. If \nnarcissistic demand is a workable concept here \u2013 bearing in mind Bhabha\u2019s apparent \nslippage between social and individual registers, narcissistic demand here, \nfurthermore, being employed as a basic condition of social apparatuses of power \u2013 \nthen it may lead us to a potential \u2018Achilles heel\u2019 of this order of power. We might, in \nother words, be able to menace the procedures of this power, exploit the paranoia of \nits mechanisms by refusing its narcissistic demands of self-affirmation. This may be \nthe subtle difference between a subservient obedience and a sly civility opened up by \nthe moment of colonial mimicry whose function is never to harmonize or compliment, \nbut instead, to camouflage, never simply to reaffirm or reiterate, but to repeat with \ndifference and anxiety.  \nIn short, Bhabha enables a theory, routed through psychoanalysis, of how \npower may be troubled, of how anxieties may be produced within it, through the \nvehicle of troublesome objects and events which defy easy categorization exactly by \nfollowing too strictly the colonial injunction to be the same but not quite, or in \nBhabha\u2019s own memorable phrase, \u2018almost the same but not white\u2019 (1994, p. 89). I \noffer these comments in a speculative and experimental way; clearly an attempt to \nadequately apply Bhabha\u2019s often complex formulations within the remit of critical \npsychology would require a far more sustained and analytical engagement with his \nwork. My point is simply to suggest that there may be any number of ways in which \nwe might further the intersections of postcolonial criticism and critical psychology. \nFurthermore, this example points to the fact that the concept of a psychopolitical \npsychology might be used to \u2018decolonize the mind\u2019 in a way that does not necessarily \nreflect the \u2018precolonized\u2019 state of mind, but that rather allows us to understand the \ncreation of a third, incommensurable, hybrid space. The psychology of resistance thus \nenabled would not necessarily hence be one a pristine, pure or decolonized state of \nmind, but would refer rather to an assertion of presence \u2013 or voice \u2013 that had been \npreviously muted and not given the space in which to speak. 9  In this respect we find \na convergence of theorization on behalf of a variety of postcolonial theorists who \nfocus on the necessity of creating the cultural, historical and material conditions under \nwhich the subaltern can come forward and speak for him or herself (in this respect, \nsee Guha, 1988; Guha & Spivak, 1988; Prakash, 1990, 1992; Said, 1993; Spivak, \n1988, 1996). A whole new vista of speculative possibilities thus for the theorization of \nresistance. \nTo finish, a return to Bhabha. If it is indeed the case that, as he (1994) puts it, \nit is on the basis of the affective experience of social\/political marginality that we are \nable to transform and renew our critical strategies, if, furthermore, it is from those \nwho have suffered subjugation, domination, diaspora, displacement that we learn our \nmost enduring critical lessons, then a critical psychology that makes no real \nengagement with the theory or criticism of the postcolonial would seem to be no \ncritical psychology at all. \n \nNotes \n1. Fanon and Biko of course are more accurately referred to as \u2018anti-colonial\u2019 thinkers in \nas much as they are working prior to the formal demise of colonial or apartheid \nregimes of oppression. While it is true that anti-colonial texts of this sort tend to be \nmore focussed on the immediate concerns of liberation than are postcolonial critcisms \nwhose ambit is more that of the cultural and political import of the ongoing historical \neffects of colonisation (Said\u2019s work (1978, 1993) is a good case in point), both \nliteratures clearly share fundamental commitments to concerns of racism, marginality, \ncultural dispossession and the politics of racial and cultural identity. I have opted here \nto retain the more generic and encompassing term of \u2018postcolonial\u2019, as is typically the \nconvention, because I wish to refer to a broad sway of criticism and theory that has \nyet to find its way into psychological discourse. \n2. This no doubt this is a bold claim, for crucial texts the likes of C\u00e9saire\u2019s (1972) \nDiscourse on Colonialism were in existence: I refer here to the particular, hybrid \nnature of Fanon\u2019s critique, the innovative bending of existential, psychoanalytic, \nMarxist and psychiatric modes of commentary into a unique critical vocabulary. \n3. Fanon\u2019s sociogenetic approach to psychopathology also finds its place here, \nparticularly his insistence, via the idea of \u2018pathologies of liberty\u2019, that a wide range of \npsychopathological symptoms in oppressed\/colonized groups needs be seen as the \noutcome of a double process, primarily socio-political, and only subsequently, as \ninternalised form of damage. In colonial contexts, he claims: \u2018The neurotic structure \nof the individual is simply the elaboration, the formation, the eruption within the ego, \nof conflictual clusters arising in part out of the environment and in part out of the \npurely personal way in which the individual reacts to these influences\u2019 (1986, p. 81). \n4. This point resonates strongly with Edward Said\u2019s (1983) notion of \u2018secular criticism\u2019, \nnamely the idea that disciplinary purism - and its concomitant preoccupation with a \nprecise, insular technical vocabulary \u2013 precisely prevents a political mode of criticism, \nfunctioning, by contrast, to effectively foreclose the asking of certain political \nquestions, the making of important political links. The project of secular criticism \nhence should make texts (in Said\u2019s domain of literary criticism), or, more pertinently \nperhaps psyches (in the domain of Fanon\u2019s concerns in Black Skin, White Masks), \nreassume their \u2018affiliations with institutions, agencies, classes, ideologically defined \nparties\u2019 (Said, 1983, p. 212). \n5. To remain unaware of this fact means that one\u2019s model of colonial discourse becomes \nstrangely static, lacking in flexibility, monolithic even, too rigidly structured along \nthe master-slave dialectic. Indeed, there are a number of densely inter-woven \nproblems for Bhabha that deserve more extended treatment. Briefly, a model of \ncolonial discourse that does not adequately grapple with psychical dynamics 1) \nallows for insufficient engagement with the details of enunciation (that is, the \nspecificity of the location and address of exchange), 2) too easily assumes a single \nover-riding political intention on the part of the colonizer, 3) fixes the relationship \nbetween discourse and politics into a deterministic or functionalist model, 4) pays too \nlittle attention to the theorization of resistance or interference (to the possibility of \nwhat Bhabha (1994) refers to as the \u2018disarticulation\u2019 of the colonial subject) (Childs \n& Williams, 1997; Moore-Gilbert, 1997; Young, 1990).  \n6. Black Consciousness, even in the South African context that I focus on here, is \nclearly not reducible to Biko alone, as the writings of Manganyi (1973, 1977, 1981), \nFatton (1986), and more recently, Mnguni (2000), make clear. (See also Couve, 1984; \nMzamane 1991; Nengwekhulu, 1981; Sono, 1993).  \n7. It makes for interesting speculation here, to consider, as part of a potential \npsychology of resistance, that a politics of solidarity may well be based on a shifting \nset of co-ordinates, which, perhaps like Spivak\u2019s \u2018strategic essentialism\u2019 may appear \nessentialist in nature but in fact are not, although they constitute a critical mass of \nsorts for political action. \n8. It is easy here, as Kros (1999) notes, to soften Biko\u2019s radicalism on this point. Indeed, \nBiko rejected the idea that blacks should in any way be assimilated into \u2018white \nsociety\u2019, and on this basis that he argued that whiteness was a concept that \u2018warrants \nbeing despised, hated, destroyed and replaced by an aspiration with more human \ncontent in it\u2019 (Biko, 1978, p. 77). In Kros\u2019s own terms: \u2018\u2018whiteness\u2019, no less than \n\u2018blackness\u2019 [for Biko] was a historically constituted identity with profoundly limiting \nramifications for those who found themselves defined by it. It was not to be \nshed\u2026simply by an act of goodwill precisely because it was so bound up with long \nhistorical processes and entrenched material interests\u2019 (1999, p. 7). \n9.
