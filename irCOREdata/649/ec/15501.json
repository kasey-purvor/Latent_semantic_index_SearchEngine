It aims to contrast the relative \nprecision with which the term is used in the environmental arena with the current \nusage in international relations. Contrasting the Precautionary Principle with \nideas of precaution, prevention, pre-emption and similar terms in post-\nstructuralist analyses of risk, humanitarian intervention and US foreign-policy in \nthe aftermath of September 11th 2001, the paper identifies costs and benefits in \ndeploying a more carefully specified account of the Precautionary Principle. In \nparticular, it highlights key issues of regulatory authority and the way in which \npolicy-makers and analysts understand and respond to the limits of knowledge \nand knowledge-systems as important challenges to which careful use of the \nPrecautionary Principle can potentially contribute. The paper concludes by \nsuggesting that both policy-making and policy analysis could potentially be \nimproved by adapting and extending the idea of the Precautionary Principle as it \nis deployed in other policy arenas. \n \nKey words: hazard, precaution, Precautionary Principle, risk, security, Iraq war, \nJust War, governmentality \n 2 \nIntroduction \nThe language of foreign policy has been significantly altered since the attacks on \nthe World Trade Centre and Pentagon on 11 September 2001. Led by the Bush \nAdministration\u201fs much analysed, debated and critiqued National Security \nStrategies of 2002 and 2006, the issues of regime change and preventive war (or \npreemptive war in the terms of the National Security Strategy) have driven the \nidea that attaining national security in the face of terrorism requires innovative \ntechniques.1 The use of enhanced interrogation techniques (or torture in plain \nterms) and \u201eextraordinary rendition\u201f have reinforced the argument that a changed \nsecurity situation and different sort of security threat demand a move away from \npreviously proscribed practices.2  \nWhat holds these different instances of those arguments for innovation together \nis the idea of anticipatory action, sometimes labelled \u201eprecaution\u201f.3 In order for \nthe US government (although the argument ought, in theory anyway, to hold for \nany other government) to fulfil its fundamental \u201eobligation\u201f to provide for the \nsecurity of its citizens in changed circumstances action must be taken in advance \nof threats becoming fully formed and indisputably apparent.4 Whether that be \noverthrowing governments suspected of planning to acquire nuclear weapons, or \nstriking terrorist organisations planning further mass-casualty attacks or, at its \nmost threatening, a proliferating government willing and able to assist a terrorist \norganisation, the gathering of intelligence information and the snuffing out of \nplots must take place at the earliest possible opportunity.5 \n 3 \nThe idea of anticipatory action in advance of complete knowledge of either the \nconsequences or likelihood of a particular course of action has generated a great \ndeal of political and academic debate and discussion, and in realms well beyond \nthe foreign policy of the United States. Ideas of hazard, risk and precaution are, \nindeed, embedded in the legal, institutional and regulatory practices of policy-\nmaking in areas such as environmental and public health policy, in particular via \nthe \u201ePrecautionary Principle\u201f (PP). In these arenas, these terms have acquired, \nover three decades or so of debate, advocacy and implementation, a \ncomparative precision of meaning and rigour of use that is in contrast to the way \nsuch terms are generally deployed across accounts of foreign policy-making and \nanalysis.  \nSpecifically, this paper aims to look at the way that current discussion of risk and \nthe Precautionary Principle confuse a number of separable ideas and draw their \npower from different intellectual backgrounds and approaches. There is, for \nexample, a lack of careful differentiation between hazard and risk that tends to \nblur the physical, measurable and predictable with the social, subjective and \nunpredictable. Concepts of \u201erisk\u201f and \u201eprecaution\u201f are deployed in various ways, \nfor example analyses of governmentality indebted to Foucault;6 notions of \nprecaution, very different in kind from the post-structuralist readings, derived from \nJust War theory;7 and a general sense of \u201ebetter safe than sorry\u201f underpinning \npreventive war strategies.8 None of these, the paper argues, capture the idea of \nthe Precautionary Principle as used in other policy arenas and this is unfortunate \nfor two reasons. Firstly, it confuses and undermines a useful tool for policy-\n 4 \nmaking and policy analysis. Secondly, it serves to obscure a key challenge facing \nefforts to transpose precautionary policy-making from arenas like environmental \npolicy to foreign policy: regulatory authority. \nRisk, Hazard and the Precautionary Principle \nWithin arenas where the Precautionary Principle affects policy-making and \nanalysis there are typically two elements to assessing a potential threat. First is \nhazard, which can be defined as \u201ethreats to people and the things they value\u201f.9 \nSecond is the concept of risk which is commonly defined as \u201ethe probability of an \nadverse future event multiplied by its magnitude\u201f.10 These are clearly linked \u2013 \nhazard is a necessary element of risk \u2013 but they tend to invite different types of \nanalytical approach depending on the types of hazard that we are concerned with \nand the way in which we understand probability and magnitude. The debate on \nhazards and risks tends to fall under two distinct arguments: objective risk \n(science-based assessments of risk issues); and perceived risk, (risk as a \ncultural construct). Objective risk is a way of accurately measuring probability \nand magnitude by quantitative, reductive scientific procedures. During the 1980s, \nthe Royal Society Report of the Study Group on Risk Assessment11 was, \naccording to one risk management theorist, \u201ethe canonical exposition of risk \npolicy\u201f.12 It was a scientific understanding which views risk \u201eas the probability that \na particular adverse event occurs during a stated period of time, or results from a \nparticular challenge. As a probability in the sense of statistical theory, risk obeys \nall the formal laws of combining probabilities\u201f.13  \n 5 \nBy contrast, the idea of perceived risk relies on cultural theory to describe a \ndifferent version of risk. In a pioneering study, it was argued that society deals \nwith risks in a culturally determined way, rather than being linked to objective risk \nmeasurement.14 In this approach to risk, which is incomprehensible to the \nscientific mind, the nature of the hazard and its probability are subjective. For \nexample, as Adams noted, \u201eslipping and falling on ice \u2026 is a game for young \nchildren, but a potentially fatal accident for an old person. And the probability of \nsuch an event is influenced both by a person\u201fs perception of the probability, and \nby whether they see it as fun or dangerous\u201f.15 The argument here is that social \nand cultural processes are at work that are not recognised under classic scientific \ninvestigative methods. On a societal level this approach to risk takes account of \nmoral, political, economic and cultural factors, rather than simply objective risk \nmeasurement.16  \nIt is clear that there are uncertainties, ambiguities and sometimes ignorance in \nthe process of attempting to define hazard and risk, with a view to ascertaining \nwhether they are serious enough for some form of remedial action. As a result, \nthere is scientific uncertainty that goes beyond the range of known, observable \nuncertainties that are recognised within the parameters of the system being \nresearched. \u201eScientific knowledge gives prominence to a restricted agenda of \ndefined uncertainties \u2013 ones that are tractable \u2013 leaving invisible a range of other \nuncertainties, especially about the boundary conditions of applicability of the \nexisting framework of knowledge to new situations\u201f.17 In his seminal work, Wynne \nproduced a typology to identify four different kinds of uncertainty: risk, \n 6 \nuncertainty, ignorance and indeterminacy. Risk is considered to be when we \n\u201eknow the odds\u201f \u2013 that is, when we know the boundaries of the system under \ninvestigation, and are able to measure in some way the factors involved. \nUncertainty represents knowledge of the parameters of a system\u201fs \u201elimitations of \nobservational and measurement techniques\u201f.18 Ignorance is that which is not \nknown: for ignorance to be identified, new knowledge must be discoverable. The \nlast category, indeterminacy, is the \u201erecognition of the open-ended and \nconditional nature of knowledge and its embedded-ness in social contexts\u201f.19 \nThis fourth category recognises that social behaviour has to be included into the \npolicy process, and this is a characteristic of the Precautionary Principle. It \nhighlights the point that the \u201eobjective risk\u201f approach implies that risk is always \nquantifiable, but in doing so it reduces scientific uncertainties to the notion that \nwhat is studied by experts is controlled and all ambiguities are solvable.20 \nThe development of the PP owes much to the UN Conference on Environment \nand Development held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992, where solutions were \nsought to find ways to conserve resources for future generations \u2013 the idea of \nsustainability. The PP has also become a guiding idea in European Union \nenvironmental policy.21 In recent years the precautionary principle has been used \nincreasingly in areas other than sustainability issues, such as health screening \nand food related issues.22  \nPrinciple 15 of the Rio Declaration neatly demonstrates the main elements of the \nPP: \u201eWhere there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of scientific \n 7 \ncertainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to \nprevent environmental degradation.\u201f23 \nDespite the tensions and the difficulties of definition we can observe certain \ncommon characteristics within the Precautionary Principle.24 These would \ninclude: \na. Acceptance of the limits of current knowledge on a given issue \nGovernments clearly need the rationality that hard scientific evidence brings to \nthe appraisal of risk because technological risk situations need sound scientific \nevidence to discover where the uncertainty is located. But they should also \nrecognise the conditional nature of scientific knowledge and that the uncertainties \noften prevent sound recommendations; \nb. Openness to alternative solutions \nIn the presence of ignorance and uncertainty, initiators of the problem under \ninvestigation should be prepared to look for alternative solutions to the safety of \ntheir products\/systems; \nc. Proportionality of response  \nCosts of actions to reduce or prevent hazards should not be disproportionate to \nlikely benefits and should not aim for zero risk. The focus here is on the \nmagnitude of the uncertainty. Rather than simply saying \u201ethere is some \nuncertainty therefore we should not proceed\u201f, this suggests that the level of \n 8 \nuncertainty should be assessed, and that the solution should be proportional to \nthe problem;25 and,  \nd. Reversing the \u2018onus of persuasion\u2019  \nIf the process of decision-making is to be fair, attention must be paid to the \nburden of persuasion \u2013 \u201ewhich party has the burden of demonstrating or refuting \na presumed fact\u201f.26 However, the idea that the burden of persuasion should be \nshifted to the proposers of innovation to convince other stakeholders that there is \nnot a problem is quite a radical change as negatives are difficult to prove, and \nany formalising of the duty of care may stifle innovation and growth.  \nThus, the PP \u201eis broadly characterised by the acceptance of the limits of scientific \nknowledge (science does not know all the answers); its openness to alternative \nsolutions (other disciplines can contribute to the debate); the placing of the \nburden of proof on the initiators of technological change \u2026; and the inclusion of \nthe knowledge of wider society rather than that of science and industry alone\u201f.27 \nThese characteristics recognise that social behaviour has to be included in the \npolicy process and therefore leans towards perceived risk, rather than objective \nrisk measurement which are based on reductionist science alone. \nRisk and Hazard in International Relations \nThe arena of international relations is one where debates about hazard and risk \nwould, at first glance, appear to be particularly applicable. The subject has \ntraditionally been dominated by questions, such as war, where these ideas would \n 9 \nseem to be central. Yet the usage of these terms is typically imprecise, at least in \ncomparison with other policy areas.  \nMajor areas of foreign and defence policy \u2013 nuclear deterrence, for example \u2013 \nare all about manipulating probabilities and managing the most extreme sorts of \nhazards imaginable, such as global thermonuclear war, in order to achieve \npolitical goals, including, potentially, peace. Equally, technological innovation has \nhad major effects on these sorts of debates and policies, and thus arms control \nnegotiations have, for example, had to balance the effect innovation may have on \nhighly valued goals in ways that do not bring about unacceptable costs. It is \npossible to read many of the classic nuclear arms control treaties via a lens of \nrisk and the management of that risk in order to avoid the hazard of war with the \npotential to escalate to nuclear confrontation. Issues of ignorance and \nuncertainty, to borrow Wynne\u201fs ideas, also play their role. There is also a clear \ninteraction here between objective and subjective risks, with the latter being far \nmore important to understanding the politics of nuclear deterrence and arms \ncontrol than the former. \nHowever, this apparent precision of hazard and risk, objective versus subjective \nrisk and the clarity that formal risk assessment promises is difficult to obtain.28 \nThis might help explain why the idea of hazard is one that seems to appear very \nrarely in international relations and then in the context of formal modelling.29 We \nunderstand that the scientific certainty of an objective analysis of hazards and the \nmodellable and statistically demonstrable risks that they may give rise to is rarely \n 10 \nattainable in international relations, and particularly in policy-making. Different \npolitical cultures and the beliefs and values of individual decision-makers may \nhave significant effects on a willingness to take risks \u2013 risk appetite \u2013 and on the \nappreciation of the different risks that a situation may bring.  \nIt is therefore not altogether surprising that the issue of subjective risk has been \npicked up more extensively. The social dimension of risk has been heavily \ninfluenced by the ideas of Ulrich Beck in his influential sociological discussions of \n\u201eRisk Society\u201f.30 Beck\u201fs principal focus is on the transformation of what IR would \ntraditionally label \u201edomestic\u201f societies under the impacts of modernisation and \ntechnology and a distinctive move away from the social, political and economic \nprocesses that characterised the industrialising phase of modernity. Beck has \ndeveloped this idea into the notion of \u201eworld risk society\u201f, drawing on the debates \nover globalisation and the idea of the transformation of international relations \naway from \u201eWestphalian\u201f models emphasising sovereignty, territory and ideas of \nstate-based power and national interests.31 The creation, manipulation and \nmanagement of risk is a key aspect of these sociological processes and creates \nsocial, political and economic environments in which opportunity, power and \nreward are intimately connected with the ability to take, share and exploit risks \nand where technologies of risk management, such as insurance and financial \ninstruments, play a key role.32  \nRisk and governmentality in IR \n 11 \nIt is noteworthy, though, that many of the efforts to incorporate risk into IR depart \nin important ways from the idea of risk as Beck deployed it, bringing it instead \ninto contact with key notions drawn from contemporary continental political \ntheory, and in particular Foucault\u201fs notion of \u201egovernmentality\u201f.33 This allies the \nidea of risk to a broadly critical and post-structural perspective that analyses risk \nin terms of its contribution to the ability of governments to establish narratives \nsupportive of apparatuses of discipline and control. In particular, important and \ninteresting recent work has used risk as a tool for assessing the significance of \nthe war on terror as a particularly distinctive form of this logic of governmentality, \ntaking the idea of the catastrophic level of risk associated with major terrorist \nattacks as the basis for extending technologies, techniques and discourses of \nsurveillance and intelligence gathering to unprecedented heights in the name of \n\u201eprecaution\u201f.34  \nThus the idea of precaution has begun to appear within this literature, too, \nalthough in a way that is at odds with the form to be found in the Precautionary \nPrinciple.35 In this Foucauldian mode of understanding risk, precaution is about \nthe governmental logic underpinning more and more stringent and extensive \nforms of intelligence gathering and surveillance in support of the need to meet \nthe unattainable political imperative of reducing the risk of catastrophic terrorist \nattack to zero.36 This is used to justify various coercive forms, from indefinite \ndetention through extraordinary rendition, \u201eenhanced interrogation\u201f (i.e. torture), \nto preventive war. These practices demonstrate logics or create forms and \nspaces that connect the notion of risk to other crucial critical concepts in post-\n 12 \nstructuralist analyses, such as the idea of the exception and the work of both Carl \nSchmitt and Giorgio Agamben.37  \nThe virtues and insights of such forms of analysis are many and varied, and the \nuse of the notion of risk within post-structural analyses of international relations is \nan important move in turning back on itself as a tool of critique an important \nelement of the justification of exceptional, even unlawful, policies in the name of \ndefraying or even defeating the risks posed by fundamentalist trans-national \nterrorism. Policy-making is revealed as reliant on an ostensibly impartial, even \nquasi-scientific, notion of risk and risk management that is neither of these \nthings. Instead, this veneer hides a process of power accumulation and \ndeployment that is changing the nature of surveillance and intelligence gathering \nin ways that undermine liberty and centralise control over permissible framings of \npolitical challenges.38 Policy-analysis deploying more conventional understanding \nof the Precautionary Principle are also subject to critique as a part of the problem \nbecause of the way that they buy into the idea that we can attain a degree of \nindependent, even apolitical, knowledge about these risks that will enable us to \ndevise effective strategies of risk management.  \nThis paper resists this post-structuralist move, however, in favour of considering \nhow it is that the Precautionary Principle as it has been developed within \nenvironmental and public health fields is beginning to enter into the foreign and \nsecurity policy fields as a policy-making tool and as a mode of policy analysis \nrather than as a rhetorical device or critical concept. This requires us to be more \n 13 \nsensitive to the way that critical uses of \u201erisk\u201f tend to emphasise the social \nconstruction and manipulation of the interplay between, in the case of major \nterrorist attacks, catastrophic risks at very low levels of probability to justify \npolitical actions. As the post-structuralists argue, we should be sceptical of efforts \nto deploy seemingly scientific ideas like hazard, risk and probability in defence of \npolicies that accrue power to certain, already highly privileged, actors. However, \nthat does not mean that we should assume that these analytical tools have been \nirretrievably coopted into the discourse of power and can no longer be used as \nanalytical tools and in the policy-making process to good effect.  \nAs the language of risk becomes more widely deployed, especially in relation to \nterrorism, and as policy-makers stress the importance of addressing risks as \nearly as possible,39 the need for precision and accuracy in how hazard and risk \nare conceptualised and deployed in policy debate grows. The distinctions noted \nearlier in Wynne\u201fs work of risk as something about which we can know the odds \nand indeterminacy or even ignorance, which demand different responses \nidentifying the limits of our knowledge and the possibility of discovering new \nknowledge, are not closely observed in the post-structuralist approach. Indeed, \nrisk is seen by some as characteristic of the unknowable or the purely \nimaginary.40 These, at least on the account of the Precautionary Principle \ndeveloped at the start of this paper, are different types of knowledge situations \nand ought to require different types of responses. Does this separation represent \na viable paradigm for how we might think effectively about risk, precaution and \nthe Precautionary Principle in the policy-making and policy analysis context? \n 14 \nPrecaution, humanitarian intervention and Just War \nOne area where the idea of precaution has been explicitly invoked in policy-\nmaking and analysis is humanitarian intervention, but here, too, there are \nproblems of conceptual specificity that hamper the transfer of the PP from \nenvironmental and public health fields to foreign policy.41 For example, according \nto Ramesh Thakur, \u201eEven when the just cause threshold of conscience-shocking \nloss of life or ethnic cleansing is crossed, intervention must be guided by the \nprecautionary principles of right intention, last resort, proportional means and \nreasonable prospects\u201f.42 However, although Thakur makes reference to various \nthreshold criteria that need to be countenanced by policymakers, he has, \nnevertheless, referred to plural precautionary principles. In other words, Thakur \ndoes not offer us a working definition of what a foreign policy based on the \nPrecautionary Principle might be. Instead, he has forwarded what might be \nregarded as principles that are precautionary. They are also precautionary in the \nsense that we should exercise care in how we respond to an event \u2013 \u201econscience \nshocking loss of life or ethnic cleansing\u201f \u2013 that has already occurred. This \ncontrasts with those who see precaution as being about acting in advance of \nspeculative or imagined harms.43  \nA similar point arises in the ICISS report, co-chaired by Gareth Evans and \nMohamed Sahnoun. According to this report, \u201ecriteria for military intervention for \nhuman protection purposes \u2026 can be succinctly summarised as right authority, \njust cause, right intention, last resort, proportional means and reasonable \n 15 \nprospects\u201f.44 Interestingly, further on in the same report the authors argue that \nright intention, last resort, proportional means, and reasonable prospects be \nclassified as \u201eother precautionary criteria\u201f.45 The authors then proceed to urge \nthat the UN General Assembly \u201eadopt a draft declaratory resolution embodying \nthe basic principles of the responsibility to protect, and containing\u2026 an \narticulation of the precautionary principles (right intention, last resort, proportional \nmeans and reasonable prospect) that must be observed when military force is \nused for human protection purposes\u201f.46 Although the authors are clear in defining \nthe precautionary criteria that would need to be satisfied in the event of military \naction being prosecuted for the purpose of protecting humans, it should not be \nforgotten that they refer to plural \u201eprecautionary principles\u201f. One is left to wonder \nwhether, for example, \u201eright intention\u201f might be one individual and discrete \nprecautionary principle compared to, for the sake of argument, the other \nprecautionary principle of \u201elast resort\u201f.  \nThis vagueness stems, we argue, from the lack of careful conceptualisation of \nrisk in this area. There is a very general sense of the Hippocratic principle \u2013 first \ndo no harm \u2013 at work, so that before acting to address humanitarian \nemergencies we should be careful to ensure that we do not make the situation \nworse. What is striking, however, is that this notion of precaution seemingly \nderives from a moral obligation on the part of those countenancing intervention \nthat is the corollary of the basis upon which a putative right to intervene rests. \nThe idea of the Precautionary Principle embodied in the Rio Declaration simply \nappears inapplicable in this context. The risks of serious or irreversible damage \n 16 \nare present, but lack of scientific certainty is simply unavoidable and we are \nthrown back on issues of political judgement which are significantly influenced by \nmoral claims that are inescapable outside the sort of scientific assessment and \ntesting regime that may be applicable in environmental policy. The post-\nstructuralist notion of risk as indeterminate and a mechanism for controlling the \nfuture through manipulating political subjectivity is also absent in the face of \nevents that have already occurred and demand a political response.47  \nThe existence of cosmopolitan moral obligations owed across sovereign \nboundaries to fellow human beings undergoing grave harms at the hands of, or \nas a result of the failure of, their government animates the humanitarian \nintervention debate.48 The argument of Responsibility to Protect is that those \nobligations can, in extreme circumstances, justify the use of coercive military \nmight to mitigate or halt those harms. The argument most typically used in \ninternational relations against such action \u2013 that it infringes on the sovereignty of \nthe state that is subject to intervention \u2013 is overruled because that claim to \nsovereignty is seen to be derivative from the state\u201fs ability to protect and promote \nthe prior rights of its citizens. Where a state and its government are unable or \nunwilling to fulfil this obligation, the claim to sovereignty lapses. Indeed, the act of \nintervention may be seen as being restorative of sovereignty because the \nultimate aim should be the restitution of a political authority that can and will \nuphold citizens\u201f rights.49 This is not just a prudential move in the name of the \ninternational order or the enhancing of security, it is an importantly moral \nobligation that ought to be fulfilled. Because of both the unpredictability of the \n 17 \noutcomes of the use of armed force and the moral seriousness of fighting and \nkilling in the name of protecting lives and rights then measures should always be \ntaken to try to prevent such circumstances occurring in the first place and all \nreasonable alternative courses of action should be explored.  \nThese are rarely circumstances, and these are not analytical questions, which \nlend themselves to objective, statistical analysis based on clear scientific \nevidence. The idea of risk as a significantly social phenomenon is stretched \nfurther in this usage to incorporate not just social understandings of the \nsignificance of certain risks to things that society values, but also ideas of \nuniversal moral hazards \u2013 that we should value the lives of other human beings \nelsewhere in the world and respond to threats to those lives. We must also \nrespond to crises that threaten the moral value attached to the sovereign state, \nconceptualised in Responsibility to Protect as the best available means for the \nprotection and promotion of human rights.  \nThe deployment of moral argument and the derivation of these \u201eprecautionary \nprinciples\u201f from the tradition of Just War theory is highly significant. It is difficult, \nand potentially intellectually dangerous, to aim at generalisation about a tradition \nof thought as diverse and dynamic as that of Just War, but the use of principles \nlike proportionality, just cause, reasonable prospects, right intention and \nlegitimate authority \u2013 classic jus ad bellum principles \u2013 in this way suggests an \neffort to transfer potential bases for normative enquiry into empirical principles for \nassessing policy options.50 Just War theory does not lend itself to the kind of \u201etick \n 18 \nthe box\u201f approach to moral assessment implied by the use of precautionary \nprinciples by Thakur or Evans and Sahnoun. The idea of a knowledge system \nwith well-understood boundaries, processes and outcomes enabling us to know \nthe risks we are taking is not one that many would apply to humanitarian \nintervention. The uncertainty involved in these principles goes much further than \nuncertainty about whether some particular interpretation of how they might apply \nin a given set of circumstances is fulfilled or not.51 Instead, what we are reminded \nof here is the moral significance of political action and the perennial need for \nmoral enquiry into the use made of lethal organised violence in the name of a \ngreater good of some kind, whether that be order, justice, humanitarianism, \nhuman rights or one of several other possible candidates.  \nThe Precautionary Principle as deployed in environmental policy is of a different \nkind than these precautionary principles. It offers an approach to policy-making \nand analysis that is useful in these sorts of circumstances because it urges us \nnot to demand certainty before we act and to acknowledge the need for \njudgement and the taking of political responsibility in the face of competing \npredictions of the future outcomes of policy choices. It is not, though, of great \nhelp in answering profound moral questions and that should be acknowledged. \nDifferences between the PP and existing ideas: prevention and pre-emption  \nTherefore, when it comes to this field, the literature assessing the Precautionary \nPrinciple in the specific sense is limited, although some work is being done.52 In \naddition, this wider literature does not seem to adequately distinguish between \n 19 \nprecaution and prevention. The distinction between the two is that: \u201eprecaution \nconcerns potential or hypothetical hazards (uncertainty) whereas prevention \ndeals with known and recognised risks\u201f.53 It is hypothetical hazard that tends to \nbe most prominent in the post-structuralist literature, for example. Moreover, \nelements of precaution are arguably increasingly visible in foreign policy. Terms \nsuch as prevention, pre-emption and precaution need careful examination to \navoid confusion. Kegley and Raymond, for example, remind us, \u201epreventive \nmilitary attack entails the use of force to eliminate any possible future strike, even \nwhere there is no reason to believe that aggression is planned or the capability to \nlaunch such an attack is operational\u201f.54 In other words, \u201epreventive war is based \non the concept that war is inevitable, and that it is better to fight now while the \ncosts are low rather than later when the costs are high\u201f.55 Therefore, it \u201emight be \nargued that preventive war arises \u201efrom states\u201f inability to trust each other to keep \nto a bargain\u201f.56  \nSome literature claims the Precautionary Principle provided an important element \nof US defence strategy under George W. Bush.57 Such arguments in this \nliterature do not differentiate sufficiently between the PP and the preventive \nprinciple. The difference is that the PP is triggered by uncertainty as to the facts \nof the issue in hand, while prevention deals with purportedly known situations: \nthere is no apparent doubt as the desires and intentions of al Qaeda, only its \ncapabilities. On the other hand, pre-emption \u201eis nothing more than a quick draw. \nUpon detecting evidence that an opponent is about to attack, one beats the \nopponent to the punch and attacks first to blunt the impending strike\u201f.58 An \n 20 \nexample of this strategy would by the Israeli offensive in the 1967 Six Day War, \nwhere Israeli intelligence detected an existential threat from its neighbours and \nlanded the first blow.59 Nevertheless, a pre-emptive strike is not precautionary as \nit relates to a danger where the probability is certain, rather than being a matter \nof debate and dispute.  \nIn a BBC TV documentary, the writer and producer Adam Curtis examined the \nwar on terror policies of the US and British Governments over recent decades.60 \nThe documentary examined the threat from organised terror networks and asked \nwhether they are an illusion. Curtis argued that there is a shift from evidence-\nbased \u201ewhat is\u201f decision-making to a speculative, imaginary \u201ewhat if\u201f, or worst-\ncase scenario decision-making.61 Towards the end of the programme Curtis \nquotes the former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, as stating that the politician\u201fs \nrole in this new threat was to look into the future and imagine the worst that might \nhappen and then act ahead of time to prevent it.62 Curtis then posed the idea that \nthis statement means the Prime Minister was embracing the Precautionary \nPrinciple. It may be that precaution is actually a better characterisation of what \nthe US government styles as \u201epre-emption\u201f, but which most IR scholars see as \npreventive war, given the uncertainties involved. \nHowever, the level of those uncertainties is a very significant issue. In a famous \nexample of taking precautionary thinking to its logical extremes, former US Vice-\nPresident Dick Cheney propounded the \u201e1% doctrine\u201f \u2013 the idea that if there was \na 1% chance that Iran could acquire a nuclear weapons capability the US should \n 21 \nact as though it were a certainty.63 This is an example of precautionary thinking, \ncertainly, but it is also an example of an exceptional lack of analytical \nsophistication. Suggesting that US policy on a crucial international issue should \nbe based on a marginal possibility, itself linking through to other marginal \npossibilities to do with the uses that Iran might make of such a capability and that \nIran\u201fs behaviour might not be influenced by a whole range of deterrent strategies, \nis misguided at best. The Precautionary Principle is not about the elimination of \nrisk, as Cheney\u201fs doctrine appears to be, or Blair\u201fs account of the changing \nnature of political responsibility might suggest. It is also easy to see how \narguments like Cheney\u201fs or Blair\u201fs also feed into the post-structural, \ngovernmentality analysis of the use of the language of risk, too. Instead, \nhowever, the Precautionary Principle is about the acceptance and management \nof risk. It is impossible to eliminate risk, but there needs to be, in policy-making \nand analysis, a balance of judgements about what are and are not acceptable \nrisks, linked to the value of the putative outcomes of accepting certain risks and \nin awareness of the limitations of knowledge. The view that the elimination of the \npossibility of highly unlikely but catastrophic risks, such as a nuclear attack by a \nterrorist organisation in a major city, is both an overwhelming political duty that \ncan justify any policy promulgated and prosecuted in its name and the \nparadigmatic example of risk-based analysis and the deployment of the \nPrecautionary Principle is seriously mistaken. The need for awareness of the \ndistinction between precaution in the face of hypothetical hazard and radical \n 22 \nindeterminacy and the Precautionary Principle in the face of at least some \nreliable knowledge of the level of risk is an important if easily overlooked one. \nThe \u201e1% doctrine\u201f or other examples of extreme \u201ebetter safe than sorry\u201f thinking \nreiterate the point that the idea of the Precautionary Principle tends to be used \nwith a lack of specificity in international relations. However, an additional issue \nthat the 1% doctrine highlights is the question of who decides that a risk is at the \nlevel of 1%, 10% or 99.9%, beyond which we leave precaution behind and move \ninto the realms of preventing that which is a known outcome in absence of \ncountervailing measures? Key questions remain unresolved about who has the \nauthority to judge the level of risk and whether or not to invoke the Precautionary \nPrinciple. Here, we argue, there is a significant challenge that particularly affects \nefforts to operationalise the Precautionary Principle as a foreign policy making \ntool.  \nThe Precautionary Principle and the Challenge of International \nAuthority: Invading Iraq \nAppealing to the Precautionary Principle is a complex and potentially highly \ncontroversial task. The most significant challenge facing translating this principle \nto making and analysing foreign policy is the authority structures that are typically \npresumed in discussions of the Precautionary Principle and those at work in the \narena of international politics. This is not to appeal to some simplistic \u201edomestic \npolitics equals hierarchy\u201f versus \u201einternational politics equals anarchy\u201f dichotomy, \nbut it is to note that the Precautionary Principle generally adopts an expectation \n 23 \nabout authority structures that assumes there is consensus, or even formal and \ninstitutionalised mechanisms, for determining where decision-making authority \nlies. Thus within the public health and environmental contexts, especially within \nEurope, governmental or EU bodies have established the rules about when the \nPrecautionary Principle ought to be applied and can adjudicate on disputes \nbetween those pressing for its application and those preferring alternative \napproaches, such as \u201esound science\u201f.  \nThese lines of authority are far less clear in the international arena, at least \noutside of the European Union. Thus debates about the precautionary principle \nas a way of formulating, presenting and assessing foreign policy decisions face \nsome important challenges in terms of fundamental questions about the \nregulatory environment. This is illustrated by two existing analyses of the \ndecision-making in the run up to the 2003 Iraq invasion. McLean and Patterson \nargue that the Precautionary Principle can be deployed as a way to understand \nthe resistance to the invasion being led by the French and German governments \nin UN Security Council debates. The US, as the initiator of a new technique \u2013 \n\u201epreventive war\u201f \u2013 for managing a complex nexus of policy-problems, faced the \nneed to persuade the sceptics on the Council of the probable safety and \neffectiveness of their proposed course of action. However, Stern and Wiener see \nthe US government as being the proponent of a policy appealing to the \nPrecautionary Principle, seeing the UN as an obstacle to the deployment of this \nprinciple and as peripheral to the authority the Bush administration was aiming to \ndeploy.64 Here the regulatory authority is also the policy initiator, with the role of \n 24 \nprecaution and the PP much more in line with the way risk has tended to be used \nin IR and where being seen to take early and effective action in the face of \npotentially catastrophic hazard in the absence of certainty is centre-stage. Issues \nof supra-national regulatory authority, sources of information \u2013 such as the UN \nweapons inspection teams \u2013 and the risks to the viability of these systems are \nswept away by a presumed national security imperative that trumps all other \nperspectives. This is perhaps hardly surprising given the prominence and \ninfluence of so-called \u201enew sovereigntist\u201f thinking on the Bush Administration at \nthat time, with its deep distrust and legal rejection of any claims to authority over \nthe United States by extra-Constitutional bodies, such as the UN, ICC and even \nthe WTO.65 These diametrically opposed views highlight the issue of perspective \non authoritative regulatory institutions and the opportunity for contestation over \nthis question within international relations, an opportunity that, although not \nabsent, is less extensive within the state or within highly institutionalised \ninternational environments like the EU.  \nAdditionally, the centrality of foreign and defence policy to debates about \nsovereignty, and the perception that absolute control over such matters are at the \nvery heart of traditional notions of sovereignty exacerbates this tension. For \nexample, Stern and Wiener frame their discussion on the basis that authority lies \nwith the United States government as the sovereign authority.66 Seeing the UN \nSecurity Council as the \u201eregulatory authority\u201f pushes towards the idea of the \nPrecautionary Principle mitigating against preventive war because of the way that \nmany members of the Council opposed the innovative policy being pushed by the \n 25 \nUnited States and United Kingdom. The risk being considered was therefore the \nrisk associated with a policy proposal that departed from established, even \nlegally enshrined, notions about the legitimacy of the recourse to war, including \nthe rejection of preventive war, and some of the most deeply entrenched \nstandards of international politics, such as the non-intervention norm. The risk \ninvolved thus stemmed from the actions of the US and UK and the justifications \nthey were offering. For Stern and Wiener, the issue is the risk supposedly, if \nerroneously, posed by Iraq and the need argued for by the US to take steps to \nprotect both US national security and wider issues of regional and global \nsecurity.67  \nThe question of political framing becomes of immense importance in interpreting \nand applying the Precautionary Principle to the formulation, presentation and \nanalysis of foreign and security policy. The challenge of knowing the level of risk \nassociated with particular hazards, such as the acquisition by Iraq of weapons of \nmass destruction, and the extent, reliability and presentation of that knowledge \nthus become acute in highly contested circumstances such as these when the \ndeployment of massive military force is at stake. An appreciation for Wynne\u201fs \ndifferent types of uncertainty and the potential contribution they could have made \nto generating more precise and careful debate was sadly lacking amongst policy-\nmakers, perhaps not surprisingly, but often, it would seem, amongst analysts too. \nKnowing the difference between \u201erisk\u201f and \u201euncertainty\u201f or \u201eignorance\u201f could have \ninformed and improved public debate in significant ways, although expecting \ngovernments to be open about their levels of uncertainty and ignorance may be \n 26 \nasking rather more than is politically plausible. Nevertheless, this distinction does \nhelp to highlight how it is that the usage of \u201erisk\u201f in international relations is \ncovering a multitude of finer distinctions and different political and analytical \nagendas that, ideally, require clarification, separation and an established basis \nfor authoritative adjudication.  \nThe Precautionary Principle and the Challenge of Authority: the role \nof non-governmental authorities \nOne way in which the problem of governments being generally unwilling to call \ntime on policies they have frequently initiated and institutionalised is partially \novercome by establishing a role for non-governmental organisations (NGOs). \nThis has become a common feature of policy-making based on the Precautionary \nPrinciple. There are ways in which non-governmental actors have been able to \nsecure a voice in the process that must be considered and taken into account by \nthose who ultimately take the decisions. This has served to diversify the range of \nvoices heard, broaden the perspectives on a particular policy challenge and \nreduce the risks of overly narrow \u201eexpert\u201f opinion becoming entrenched and \nprivileged in ways that can close-down debate and close-off potentially important \nsources of evidence.68  \nOutside of foreign policy there have been some notable moves in this direction. \nFor example, the UK government\u201fs review of the regulatory framework and the \nguidelines for scientific advice lays down new definitions of what is meant by the \nterm \u201eexpert\u201f and what constitutes \u201erelevant\u201f advice to government.69 This means \n 27 \nexpert sources are taken to include not only scientists but also public research \nbodies, consumer and other stakeholder groups, and lay membership of \ngovernment committees. Similarly, the Phillips\u201f Report on the UK\u201fs BSE outbreak \nstressed the need for government departments to insure that recruitment to \nmembership of expert committees should be based on an expanded definition of \nwho is an expert, and urges members of committees themselves to identify \nclearly and precisely their remit, and for advice itself to be honest about \nuncertainties.70 And in the EU, the Commission\u201fs policy document on the PP \noutlines its approach to the dilemma of balancing the rights of individuals, \nindustry and the need to reduce risks to the environment, human and animal \nhealth.71 Thus a more socially inclusive approach to environmental decision-\nmaking is owed to a move towards a commitment to the concept of precaution. \nIt is misleading to suggest, as many critics do, that the PP simply means that \nbusiness and science cannot innovate unless their proposals or discoveries \nsatisfy a body of people who are firm defenders of the status quo. Rather, \nevidence of a link between a damaging effect and an activity must have been \nnoticed by someone, or some scientific or governmental body to trigger an \ninvestigation under the PP. An example of this in the early years of the twentieth \ncentury was the reports of several factory inspectors of the effects of asbestos on \nworkers in those factories. This led to asbestos being identified as toxic to \nworkers and eventually to other substances being used.72 In reality what happens \nis that informal early warning systems exist, such as the factory inspectors in the \nabove example, and environmental NGOs and pressure groups who can act as \n 28 \ncompetent observers and raise instances of emerging problems. These \ncompetent observers do not produce absolute \u201eproof beyond reasonable doubt\u201f \nbut their observations\/objections are enough to trigger a decision to evoke the \nPP. Therefore, the idea that those who innovate and invent are subject to a veto \nby a group of people who are obsessively attached to an absolute version of the \nPP is not what the PP is about. It bears repeating that precaution and prevention \nare not synonymous: the PP is triggered by uncertainty as to the facts of the \nissue in question, while prevention deals with known situations. \nThere are few democracies that do not sport a vibrant range of think-tanks, public \naffairs organisations and academics willing and able to play such a role within a \npolicy-making framework indebted to the Precautionary Principle. Different \npolitical systems may, though, be less or more receptive to formalising the PP \ninto their policy practices. This has been the experience in the environmental \narena. For example, the Precautionary Principle has varying degrees of \nlegitimacy amongst civil society groups within the US, UK, Germany and France. \nThe academic literature suggests that the PP is more accepted in the continental \nEuropean states than it is in the UK or US73 although recent research has argued \nthat this characterisation is stereotypical.74 Some commentators have suggested \nthat this might be due to the latter countries\u201f preference towards minimal state \nintervention in the economy.75 However, general support for the PP within wider \nsociety does not mean government will accept it in policymaking or, even where \nit does, that more than lip-service will be paid on individual issues. The general \n 29 \nassumption that the PP is more influential in France and Germany than the US or \nUK is usually in relation to areas of \u201elow politics\u201f such as environmental policy.76  \nOther commentators argue that there is a clear divide between the US and EU in \ninternational regulation for environmental protection purposes. The US objects to \nthe PP because, it is argued, the principle\u201fs ambiguity lends itself to misuse as a \npretext for protectionism. The EU prefers a formalised idea of precaution, \nproviding a legal basis for regulatory decision-making which recognises scientific \nuncertainties and monitors for change.77 Therefore, it would appear that a \nresearch agenda is currently developing that examines the extent to which the \nidea of the PP is amenable to national governments as an idea and a way to \nframe, direct and validate social learning. It would appear that the PP would be \nmore amenable to governments in countries such as Germany or France, and \nless so to governments within the US or UK, given how these states view the PP \nin environmental politics. We might speculate that the latter governments might \nbe more reluctant to embrace the PP through their general reticence to pool \nsovereignty within international organisations (the United Nations in terms of the \nUS, and the European Union in terms of the UK). In comparison, it could be \nargued that issues of sovereignty are less important to the French and Germans.  \nConclusions \nThe language of hazard, risk, prevention and precaution has never been absent \nfrom foreign policy making or analysis, but it does seem to have become more \nprevalent in recent years, particularly since 2001. Whether concerned with critical \n 30 \ninvestigations into the role of risk in strategies of governmentality or the need for \nethical caution in the face of humanitarian crisis, the necessity of responding to \nuncertainty is unavoidable. It is also, though, hardly novel, but what marks out \nthese recent moves is the sense of an organised effort to channel policy-making \nand analysis down certain routes to create structure and direction. The use of the \nPrecautionary Principle in the environmental field has appeal in this regard, \nbecause of the way that it established principles upon which decision-making in \nthe face of uncertainty can be based. However, as this paper has tried to show, \nthe uncertainties in the field of foreign policy are of a different sort and there are \ndistinctive challenges.  \nThe tension between objective and subjective risk is both acute \u2013 the problem of \n(mis)perception is well known in international relations \u2013 and open to \nmanipulation, as stressed in post-structural analyses. The moral significance of \naction stressed in the use of precautionary principles in Responsibility to Protect \nadds to this problem. The lack of scientific certainty, statistically valid analyses \nand established mechanisms for testing, evaluating and reviewing data all \nbedevil such debates. Deploying the Precautionary Principle in foreign and \nsecurity policy-making is not a straightforward task.  \nThe PP is, though, a very useful analytical tool for framing, discussing and \ncritiquing the kinds of precautionary claims that are increasingly made in foreign \npolicy arenas such as the \u201ewar on terror\u201f and humanitarian intervention. As ideas \nof risk are increasingly appealed to by policy-makers and scholars, the PP offers \n 31 \na valuable counter-point to the looseness of public political debate and the \nemphasis on discourse and critique emphasised by those reading risk through \npost-structuralist lenses. Policy making and policy analysis in environmental and \npublic health sectors have benefited from this approach, suggesting a valuable \ncontribution can also be made, at least in analytical terms, in international \nrelations.  \n 32 \nReferences \n \n* The authors would like to thank participants in the panel at the 49th ISA \nConvention, San Francisco, where an earlier draft of this paper was presented \nfor their comments.
