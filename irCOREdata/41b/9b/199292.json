I \ndidn\u2019t really know what I was going to be. I decided that I would be a social worker or a \nprobation officer, and I did a sociology course for the first time and really enjoyed it. I \ncontingently came along General Food Corporation, who offered the Department of Social \nand Administrative Studies at Oxford University a research contract to study the relocation of \na factory. The head of the department asked me if I would be interested in getting a PhD out \nof it, and so suddenly, rather than being a probation officer, I decided to do a PhD in \nsociology. \n I did a \u2018before and after\u2019 interview survey of workers and managers of a company that \nmoved from Birmingham to Banbury, and wrote about a combination of family and \ncommunity sociology on the one hand, and industrial sociology on the other, without any \ngreat theoretical pretensions\u2014it was all very empirical. Then I moved to Cambridge and \nworked in industrial sociology in the Department of Applied Economics before moving to \nEssex, where I was required to teach sociological theory and the Enlightenment. \n While in Cambridge, I wrote a little book on class consciousness that was part of a \nwider comparative project\u2014we were going to be studying factories in four different \ncountries. So having taught Weber and Durkheim and having read most of them (much of \nwhich was for the first time\u2014I was pretty ignorant until then), I began to ask myself \n                                                 \n1 Michael Mann, The Sources of Social Power, Volume 1: A History of Power from the Beginning to 1760 AD \n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986); and Michael Mann, The Sources of Social Power, Volume 2: \nThe Rise of Classes and Nation-States, 1760\u20131914 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993). \n2 Major publications include: Michael Mann, \u2018The Autonomous Power of the State: Its Nature, Causes and \nConsequences\u2019 European Journal of Sociology, 25, no.2 (1984): 185\u2013213, reprinted in John Hall (ed.), States in \nHistory (Oxford: Blackwell, 1986), 106\u201336; Michael Mann, States, War and Capitalism (Oxford: Blackwell, \n1988); Michael Mann, Incoherent Empire (London: Verso, 2003); Michael Mann, Fascists (Cambridge: \nCambridge University Press, 2004); Michael Mann, The Dark Side of Democracy: Explaining Ethnic Cleansing \n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004); and Michael Mann, \u2018Has Globalisation Ended the Rise and \nRise of the Nation-State?\u2019, Review of International Political Economy, 4, no.3 (1997): 472\u201396. For an overview \nof Mann\u2019s work, see the various contributions in An Anatomy of Power, John Hall and Ralph Schroeder (eds.) \n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006). \n  \n \n2 \ntheoretical questions and I wrote a paper, an unpublished paper in, I think, 1972, on putting \ntogether Marx and Althusser on the one hand, and Weber on the other, both with tripartite \nmodels of social structure, and developing from there. That was the genesis of The Sources of \nSocial Power, which was originally meant to be one volume, a short and predominantly \ntheoretical book with a couple of empirical case studies, one of which was going to be the \nancient world and the Roman Empire. The project soon developed a life of its own, and so I \nstarted a gradual move towards bigger and bigger topics. \n Let me say that at the same time, politically, I made a move leftwards (I suppose Left \nLabour but I was never a Marxist). This was a phase during which there was a very serious \nthreat of nuclear war, and my views differed from those of all of my leftist friends who saw \nthe struggle between the Soviet Union and the United States as fundamentally about \ncommunism versus capitalism. I saw this as rather primitive and uninformed\u2014it seemed to \nme that, whatever the ideological elements, it was also a great-power rivalry. So I was never \npart of a particularly conventional political grouping. Mine was a relatively independent form \nof leftism. \n While I was in Colchester, I was on the Executive Committee of the Labour Party and \nthe representative of a ward (this was during the time that the Labour Party was being torn \napart and when the Social Democrats were leaving). I found my role there to be among those \npeople who were trying to hold the Colchester Labour Party together (quite unsuccessfully, it \nturned out, because it was destroyed by the Left). Indeed the present Member of Parliament \nfor Colchester, Bob Russell, is a Liberal Democrat who was then the leading right-winger in \nthe Colchester Labour Party, a very worthy local man. So there was always the influence of \npolitics which kept me away from easy answers theoretically. Thereafter it was a gradual \nprocess of broadening out. \n \nGL \nTwo things in what you\u2019ve said seem worth picking up on. One is that history in a way was \nyour first love and that seems to have stayed with you\u2014the focus on detail and drawing \ntheory from empirical facts rather than conducting research the other way round. And the \nsecond thing is the political interest and activism that you have obviously retained\u2014perhaps \nwe can talk about that later when we discuss your recent book on empire. \n \nHistorical Sociology \n \nGL \nBut first, can we talk a little bit about the method of comparative historical sociology itself? \nYou\u2019ve written and talked in the past about having a kind of Kantian \u2018as if\u2019 positivism which \nrecognises, at least epistemologically, its own insecurity and yet retains a pragmatic belief in \nempirical research that\u2019s challengeable on the basis of how well you can explain social facts \nand how well you can organise them. \n Now that leaves you open to two immediate critiques, the first from historians who \nsay that they provide an \u2018entire study\u2019 in and of itself, that facts are all that there are and that \nwe don\u2019t need any general organising picture that only works to distort the mess that is world \nhistory. The second critique is by more abstractly oriented people (I remember a Barrington \nMoore critique on this basis, i.e., that there is not enough theory in your work), and by those \nwho work with general abstractions such as rational choice scholars who see theory as the \ngeneration or working through of timeless, invariant laws. How do you defend your approach \nagainst those charges? \n \nMM \n  \n \n3 \nWell, I\u2019m never happy talking about methodological issues\u2014I am somewhat philistine about \nthem. But both the positions that you\u2019ve mentioned are really untenable. First, when \nhistorians study the multiplicity of facts, they are always importing theories and it is perfectly \nobvious, particularly once you get into middle age and you see fashions succeeding each \nother so that you know there was a time when historians were all writing about class and \nsocialism, and now of course it\u2019s far more in the way of cultural stuff, that there are always \norganising principles and one is always seeing the world through theoretical filters. Nobody \ncan do this without these processes entering into research, so I think that what social \nscientists should do is to make this explicit but then recognise that the world is going to be \nmore complicated than the theoretical categories that we begin with, so that you have to \nbounce the two (theory and history) off each other. \n And then my response to the people who develop abstract theories is that the world is \nalways more complicated than these theories allow, plus there are specificities of time and \nplace and historical development, and that these three things\u2014time, place and historical \ndevelopment\u2014have to be factored in. All of our theories of social change require some \nknowledge of history, for example. So, to take theories of globalisation as an example, ninety \nper cent of the writers on globalisation have no idea whatsoever about what the world was \nlike fifty years ago, or even twenty-five years ago. The focus is on all the supposed changes \nof the last five minutes or so with a very simplistic notion of what the past was like. This \nillustrates how one has to have a detailed grasp of time, place and historical development. \n \nGL \nThe means that you devise in order to weave a path between these two extremes\u2014history and \nabstract theory\u2014is the IEMP model. In doing so, you move from a Weberian tripartite \nscheme to one based on four fundamental sources of social power: ideological, economic, \nmilitary and political power relations. Can you explain why this was and what pay-off you \nreceived from that? \n \nMM \nWell my model is not particularly original. The tripartite scheme is very common\u2014it was \nwhat Structural Marxists like Althusser, for example, made explicit from Marxism itself. So \nmy separation of the military is the main addition I have made, and I do it for both empirical \nand analytical reasons. \n Empirically there are very many cases where military and political power can be \ndistinguished\u2014states which have very little military power but considerably higher levels of \npolitical, ideological and economic power (and vice versa). Plus, with the real autonomy of \nmilitary castes, both within states and around states, there are many military forces which are \nempirically not very well connected to states. One cannot study ethnic cleansing without \nlooking at paramilitaries, for instance.  \n Analytically too, I think it\u2019s important to recognise the distinctions which flow from \nthese two discrete forms of power. One is based on authoritative regulation, which is \nscrutinised and very often legalised, and the other is about naked organised physical force\u2014\nthese are very different. To run the two together hides considerable differences between \nthem. \n \nGL \nIt\u2019s interesting that you mention separating out military power and that being the added value \nthat you bring to the tripartite approach. Reading through your work\u2014I know that you reject \nany story of ultimate primacy\u2014it seems to me that there is some kind of implicit hierarchy in \nyour general survey of the sources of social power that runs M-P-E-I. Is that reasonable? \n  \n \n4 \n \nMM \nNo, I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m rather empiricist and I haven\u2019t finished yet, so I will think more \nsystematically about this later on, but I think that the four forms of power provide different \ncapacities rather than work as a hierarchy or as a single scale. \n So I think that economic power relations mostly mobilise the texture of everyday life \nas they involve people\u2019s subsistence and their basic practical activities. As I\u2019ve just \nmentioned, political power relations are based on authoritative regulation. Ideological power \nrelations tend to be able to mobilise movements during periods of rapid transformation and to \ninvolve a degree of emotional intensity\u2014but this is erratic and irregular. For the most part, \nideology is about the further institutionalisation or the reproduction of what is already there, \nso it is usually rather conservative. Military power enables conquest and therefore it is very \nimportant in some contexts where there is competition between different social groupings. It \nis the power relation that can grant formal victory and deliver certain predominant social \nrelations thereafter. But military power cannot so easily penetrate everyday relations. \nMilitaristic regimes repress deviants but they find it difficult to mobilise public opinion.  \n So, I haven\u2019t sorted it out yet but these are the kinds of things which make me think \nthat you probably can\u2019t have a theory of primacy because the four sources of power have \ndifferent logics and do different things. \n \nGL \nAnd because they are entwined and interconnected at a very fundamental level. \n \nMM \nYes. \n \nGL \nIn the second volume of Sources you say that ideological power relations are more immanent \nthan transcendent and it made me think about your view that ideas are not free floating, that \nthey don\u2019t do anything unless they are organised, hence the term often used to describe your \nwork: organisational materialism. \n But when we think about the norms and ideologies that were prevalent in the \nnineteenth century and their part in the making of the modern world, such as racism, \nDarwinism, colonialism, nationalism, imperialism, Marxism, or liberalism of various forms \n(even class itself has a dimension of immaterial or ideological power infused in its basic \nmaterial power), in that sense are there not at least some dimensions of ideological power that \nwere transcendent during this period rather than immanent? \n \nMM \nWell, I think that what you\u2019re saying is that ideological power as an autonomous form of \npower is transcendent, and yes that\u2019s the nature of it. Most people most of the time accept \nexplanations of their own conditions via dominant ideologies. Most people don\u2019t live at a \nvery ideological level but to the extent that they do, ideology is something that explains \u2018what \nis\u2019. But transcendent ideology\u2014there are both major ones and less major ones\u2014arises when \nthe socialisation of human beings is inadequate to the problems that confront them. There has \nto be a leap of some kind, a leap of understanding. The changes that are occurring at a \npractical level are in conflict with existing ideologies and therefore there is an articulation of \na need for some new understanding. \n \nGL \n  \n \n5 \nSome new form of meaning? \n \nMM \nYes, this is when we find that ideologically driven elites (radical ideological elites), can \narticulate certain things. But I do stress that, for the most part, ideology is about how you \ncope with practical exigencies. \n Take racism and empire, for example. How are Europeans to conceptualise their \nobvious superiority in power relations? You can\u2019t just have a racist ideology and expect to be \nable to rule peaceably over people. I\u2019m not someone who thinks that Social Darwinism in the \nsecond half of the nineteenth century is something which is essentially responsible for racism \nin the advanced countries or in their empires\u2014racism comes about earlier and through a \nnumber of sequences that relate to practical exigencies. If you want to enslave people, if you \nwant to have a plantation economy in the New World and you can\u2019t get free labour, then \nslavery is very useful. You can\u2019t enslave the indigenous population, so you bring them in \nfrom Africa, and that\u2019s something that leads people to reflect on \u2018our\u2019 superiority to \u2018them\u2019, \nand leads to practical racism well before there is any concept of Social Darwinism. \n So, for me, ideological power is more about social movements than about theories or \nthe history of ideas. I don\u2019t think that the history of ideas can really be written without the \nintersection of material power. \n \nGL \nThis all sounds as if ideas are following a functional need to impose meaning upon what is \ngoing on anyway. They seem to be following after the fact of the material situation whatever \nthat may be\u2014exploitation, slavery, the growth of nation-statism, the need to make war or \nwhatever is the central story of the time. \n \nMM \nYes, but once it emerges it can develop an autonomy, like fascism. Fascism offered an \nexplanation of why Europe was in crisis after World War I, and provided a set of solutions to \nthis crisis. This ideology, engrained in fascist movements and used by fascist leaders, led to \nprofound consequences. In a certain way it led to a certain irrationality, as it were. It led to \nwar and genocide. So it\u2019s an interstitial opening, an emergence. Ideology emerges in response \nto need but then can generate an autonomy. In this sense, it\u2019s a movement. \n \nGL \nThe corollary of this point is that, by focusing on dominant ideologies rather than those \nideologies, norms and ideas that seek to transcend and change the existing order, this is a \nnecessary side effect of what happens when you focus on the \u2018leading edge\u2019 of power. So, if \nyou are concerned primarily with despotic \u2018power over\u2019 and with infrastructural \u2018power \nthrough\u2019, then you\u2019re looking for legitimations of the existing order. But of course there is \nanother side to power\u2014\u2018power to\u2019\u2014which is resistance to this order, the story of what \nCynthia Enloe calls \u2018the silent, the marginal and the bottom rung\u2019 and the part that these \npeople, groups and movements play in altering what is considered to be the leading edge of \npower. \n \nMM \nI suppose that I have been writing predominantly about the leading edge of power, and that \ntherefore it\u2019s a consequence that I would tend to downplay the role of the losers! Now, of \ncourse, some of the losers become winners\u2014there are revolutions. In the case of the failing \n  \n \n6 \nAmerican Empire today, the insurgents have far more power than they thought they had, and \nthat can be generalised across the world. \n \nGL \nBecause they possess the weapons of the weak. \n \nMM \nYes. I didn\u2019t know until I wrote the book (Incoherent Empire) that I was going to come out \nwith this conclusion\u2014that the revolution in military affairs has also benefited the weak. The \nKalashnikov, the hand-propelled grenade launcher, the suicide bomber have all shifted the \nbalance of power, certainly in terms of military power, rather remarkably right across the \nworld. \n \nGL \nLet\u2019s talk for a minute about having a model of multiple causation, and about offering a \nmiddle-range analysis in and of itself. I\u2019m very sympathetic to the view that this is social \nscience in the sense that your work can be traced back to a tradition embracing Weber, Aron, \nC. Wright Mills and others, people involved in the type of broadening-out exercise you \nmentioned at the start. \n Unfortunately, in International Relations and to some extent more widely across the \nsocial sciences, many people have a much narrower view of what theory is, i.e., that you need \nto create some kind of Lakatosian research programme replete with hardcore assumptions, \nauxiliary hypotheses, negative heuristics and the like that generate at least a sense of a \ncumulative build-up of knowledge. So, if you don\u2019t start with a sufficiently parsimonious, \nabstract hypothesis and work deductively towards proving or disproving it, you are seen as \ncarrying out little more than interpretation. \n In this sense of theory, any approach that starts with history and works with complex \npatterns of multi-causality will be reduced to \u2018analysis\u2019 in that it lacks a determinate social \ntheory and fails to provide a finite, fixed ontological point of reference. Do you have any \ntruck with this way of thinking or do you just get on with what you\u2019re doing and with what \nyou think is the important task of social theory itself? \n \nMM \nWell I\u2019m not an imperialist! I think that there are various enterprises with various possibilities \nwithin what we call social science. I\u2019m not saying that everybody has to do the kind of thing \nthat I do. I mean, we might say that the weakness of economists is that, by and large, they \nhave such a limited range of variables that they\u2019re willing to consider, but at the same time \nit\u2019s also their strength, at least as long as it works. And so there is mileage to be got out of \nsimplifying social life, in terms of a few variables and a kind of rigorous treatment of those \nvariables, whether it\u2019s rational choice theory or whatever. \n But it is important to realise that this way of seeing theory is also imprisoning \nresearch. Take the example of economies of growth\u2014nowadays, it\u2019s been decided that \ninstitutions and technological development are the two key things that matter most for \neconomic growth. Well economists don\u2019t have a theory of either! So one does need a broader \nkind of theory and a wider concept of what theory is.  \n Now, I mean, do I have a theory of the middle range? It\u2019s a pretty big middle range, \nbut yes I suppose that I do. I am concerned with the same kind of things as Marx and Weber, \nwhich is the basic transformations of our times and how we understand those. \n \nInterdisciplinarity \n  \n \n7 \n \nGL \nThe other side to this point is that, as well as having an account of multiple causality, \nmultiple trajectories and historical development that is inevitably complex, you also work \nwithin different disciplines. Your work has taken in International Relations, obviously \nhistory, sociology and many other things\u2014anthropology as well\u2014and you\u2019ve described this \nprocess as involving a kind of \u2018looting and pillaging raid\u2019 on these disciplines. It seems to me \nthat the potential weakness of this approach is that one is drawn, at least in the first instance, \ntowards the mainstream of other disciplines, which may mean missing out on the more \ninteresting stuff that is submerged within. \n For example, you\u2019ve spoken about how in the early 1980s, sociologists like yourself \nwere looking for a theory of the state, which they found in IR realism, while some IR \nscholars were rejecting the rational unitary vision of states and state autonomy and were \nlooking towards sociology for help, which some of them found in structuralism. In this \ninstance, both found the other discipline\u2019s principal orthodoxy just as they were being \nabandoned or at least critically challenged. Do you think that\u2019s something inherent to \ninterdisciplinary work? \n \nMM \nI\u2019m not sure whether that is a necessary characteristic of interdisciplinary work. I think that in \nthe case that you mentioned, though it was true for a short period of time, sociologists soon \nrealised that states were not single actors. And if I didn\u2019t know that immediately, it was \nbecause I wasn\u2019t concentrating very hard! \n I am a sociologist before I am anything else, but I\u2019m an unconventional sociologist\u2014a \nclassical sociologist. Most of the discipline is not concerned with what I\u2019m concerned with. \nSo I don\u2019t see why I should be particularly or necessarily attracted to the mainstream in other \ndisciplines except in so far as my own pillaging raids require it. \n Take Japanese imperial history, for example. Now, I\u2019m going to be reading the basic \nmaterial in translation, and I have no independent store of knowledge about the Japanese \nEmpire. And so I suppose that in some ways I am looking for a consensus view, or at least I \ndon\u2019t want to go for too quirky a view. Rather, I want a view which provides the best general \noverview on Japanese Empire. But it\u2019ll always get interpreted in terms of my more general \napproach. Very often you\u2019re not terribly interested in internal debates or the main squabbles \ngoing on in terms of revisionism and whatever\u2014it\u2019s not what you want from history. So \nyou\u2019re not necessarily going for the main debates of the time; rather you are pillaging for \nsomething particular in relation to your own theory. \n \nGL \nSo it is a functional or instrumental reading in which you\u2019re looking for something in \nparticular and you\u2019re willing to let these internal squabbles go on. \n \nMM \nThat\u2019s right. So as far as IR is concerned, I\u2019m not particularly adept with the current range or \nfads in IR theory. My reading is a more selective appropriation of things that seem interesting \nto me. So I\u2019m not interested in, for example, constructivism as sociology took a cultural turn \nsome while ago and I\u2019ve seen constructivism in different guises. I think that by now I know \nwhat\u2019s useful about it and what isn\u2019t, so I\u2019m rather uninterested overall in this recent trend in \nIR theory. \n \nGL \n  \n \n8 \nOn the IR dimension of these pillaging raids, some of your work can seem strikingly realist. \nOn reading articles like \u2018Capitalism and Militarism\u2019 which delve into hegemonic stability and \npatterns of polarity and so on, one comes across statements like \u2018when states neglect their \nmilitarism they perish\u2019, and I was thinking as I read it that this sentence could have been \nwritten by Martin Wight.3 Your general view of the international is largely characterised by \ngeopolitical conflict mitigated by diplomacy, in soft and hard forms, which sounds like \nrealism-lite or like an English school approach to IR theory. Is that right? \n \nMM \nI think to some extent it\u2019s a kind of shorthand. If you delve into something, like the second \nvolume of Sources that is concerned with the causes of World War I, and you know that there \nare various states\u2014that is, you know that the war is a decision taken by state elites and that\u2019s \nthe authoritative power that they possess and that when these leaders declare war, people are \nconstrained by that\u2014then that is an important realist point to make about modern states, if \nnot about all states. But to do a proper explanation of World War I, you\u2019d have to go into \ndetail on half-a-dozen of these states, and I go into some detail on the German case, and in \nthat case I\u2019m breaking apart the notion of a single unitary state actor. There is a final single \ndecision, but I note the various influences at work and the pressure of various social \ngroupings that make up that final decision. So I break things apart a bit. \n I think much of this depends on context. At the moment I\u2019m thinking more about \nempires, and empires are clearly the product, not merely and often not predominantly, of state \naction. There are all kinds of adventurers and trading groups and religious groups who are \ninvolved in this enterprise and they have important power resources. They have the ability to \nconstrain governments. And so the actual explanation of empire is not confined to the \nrelationship between states, however factionalised they might be. \n \nGL \nAnd yet there\u2019s another dimension to how much your story could be considered to be an \nessentially realist one or perhaps ontologically reductionist in the international realm in that \nit\u2019s focusing primarily on geopolitics and militarism. Historical sociology in International \nRelations has focused its attack on the realist assertion of timelessness, on the idea that there \nis some eternal anarchic system that generates interstate conflict by necessity, and that \nsecurity and the struggle for survival are therefore higher order, endemic and unchanging \nfeatures of the international realm. So the focus for historical sociologists has been on the \nchanging forms of international systems over time and space, change rather than continuity, \nand to some extent on periodisation, with a view to assessing how the international and the \ndomestic landscapes and their constituent actors vary. \n In your work, you concentrate on the interplay or the dialectic between empires of \ndomination (which we\u2019d probably think of as a form of hierarchy in IR terms), and multi-\nactor power civilisation (which seems like a kind of anarchic society\u2014another reason why I \nwas struck by your closeness to an English school view of the international realm). So the \ninternational, then, is primarily a realm of geopolitics and militarism within what appears to \nbe a rather timeless, or at least only a dual, international system. There is comparatively little \nroom for the spread of the market, revolutionary internationalism, the role of various \ninternational ideologies or the multitude of other forms that the international takes throughout \nworld history.  \n                                                 \n3 Michael Mann, \u2018Capitalism and Militarism\u2019 in War, State and Society, Martin Shaw ed. (London: MacMillan, \n1984), 25\u201346. \n  \n \n9 \n The result is that the content of the international seems to rest most strongly on the \n\u2018M\u2019 part of IEMP rather than on the other sources of power which also very clearly have an \ninternational dimension. \n \nMM \nWell I think that I would be a little more hesitant to talk about this kind of dialectic between \nempires of domination and multi-state civilisations now. Things are a bit more complex than \nthat. I also wouldn\u2019t see multi-state civilisations as being anarchic. I think these are \nessentially arenas in which there is some normative sense of community of some kind, which \nmeans that the states within are not completely separate units. And also, these empires and \nmulti-state civilisations lived with each other and influenced one another and did deals with \neach other. So the Phoenicians were city-states really and for a large part were intermediaries \nbetween the Assyrians and other empires. \n I think that IR has traditionally thought, and realist IR especially, of the international \narena as being one essentially of geopolitics. That clearly isn\u2019t enough and quite obviously \nthere has been a reaction within IR making exactly this point. The growth of the recent phase \nof globalisation has been the spur to this alongside recognition of the growth of a broader \ncapitalist production which is not merely international but significantly transnational as well. \nThere is also more consciousness now of the importance of transmission through cultural \nnetworks. So I think that the space between, or the relations between and across states, has a \nmuch more diverse basis than was traditionally conceived of by IR scholars or sociologists. \n But then you see that, within the tradition of sociology, there was always a dual \ntradition. The way that my cohort of graduate students was taught is that there were societies \nand these were thought of explicitly in terms of nation-states. But there was also another \nsociety, which was industrial society and capitalist society. So we were never really \nimprisoned with only one way of seeing these things. That\u2019s what enabled me to make \nstatements such as \u2018there is no such thing as society, only multiple networks of interaction\u2019. \nSo, in some ways, this is quite a traditional sociological mode of analysis. But I\u2019m not sure \nthat I\u2019m answering your question! \n \nGL \nLet me tease it out a bit more. What do you think that International Relations is, or, more \nspecifically, what does it offer you? Is the essence of IR about the occurrence and \nreoccurrence of war and peace, about geopolitics, about adding an additional data set to what \nyou already do? Or is it about something more than this, about challenging, for example, the \ntheoretical foundations of your enterprise? \n IEMP is a very interesting way of focusing on the multidimensionality of the \ninternational and asking what this would mean for sociology and for the study of domestic \nprocesses of social change. In which case, studying the international adds some constitutive \nvalue to the enterprise of comparative historical sociology itself. Have you, do you think, \nsuccessfully built in this wider view of the international into your work? And to what extent \ndo you think that IR itself offers more than merely the M in the IEMP model? \n \nMM \nWell maybe in response to your earlier question about the sense in which I take the \nconventional path, the mainstream of a discipline, it may well be that the military dimension \nis what IR has to offer me. And I think it remains true\u2014here one has to be very careful\u2014but \nI think it is true that there are some features of relations between states which are repetitive, if \nnot timeless. \n  \n \n10 \n Take the example of empires. There may be different types of empires: overseas \nempires and land-based empires, stand-alone empires like the Chinese Empire, and rivalrous \nempires where there are multiple imperial rivalries. Yet there are some regularities involved \nin all these instances. I expect IR to pursue them relatively rigorously even though I know \nthere is a big attack, a sociological attack on them, saying that they function in very different \nways according to the social structure in question. That is true, but I can figure that out for \nmyself. \n \nGL \nRight, so again we\u2019re back to this sort of functional, instrumental reading. You\u2019re happy that \nthe discipline is wider and broader than realism and you accept that, but you take what you \nneed, and if that\u2019s what you take then so be it. \n \nMM \nYes. Say, for example, that I\u2019m thinking about war and why Europeans were so warlike \nbecause of the frequency of war in European history, and where you have multi-state systems \nelsewhere\u2014Latin America has very few wars, similarly postcolonial Africa has lots of wars \nbut very few interstate wars, and Asia as well\u2014now I would like some serious quantitative \nstudies of these. I\u2019m suggesting something but I can\u2019t prove it. So I would like some serious \nquantitative studies of other parts of the world so that I can see whether this is true and then I \ncan begin to try to explain why Europeans were so warlike. \n \nGL \nSo the point is that you could use the data, for example that being generated on the \ndemocratic peace, which you would then use to draw fundamentally different conclusions but \nwhich would help your overall project. So you search for the raw material being provided by \nother disciplines, look for what you need in it but don\u2019t necessarily embrace the conclusions. \n \nMM \nThat\u2019s right. \n \nStates \n \nGL \nAnother point to bring in here might be your work on the state. You\u2019ve talked about states \nbeing polymorphous and crystallising in various ways and that obviously supports the type of \npoint historical sociologists in IR would make, that there are different types of political units \nin different epochs and in different places that act according to their historically situated, \nparticular logic. \n \nMM \nYes. \n \nGL \nBut beneath this point is the idea that a state is a state is a state, that they all derive their \nautonomy out of necessity, that there is always territorial centralisation, that there is still, if \nyou like, some embodiment of basic statehood that one can treat as an actor in its own right, \nwhatever adjective you put in front of it.  \n  \n \n11 \n Is that, do you think, what International Relations must start off by accepting\u2014if not \nbecause it\u2019s necessarily always empirically right but because heuristically what else can we \ndo except acknowledge this shorthand means for doing theoretical work? \n \nMM \nYes, I think that\u2019s right with one or two provisos. Polities can be more or less statelike. For \nexample, many of the states in the world today do not have effective sovereignty over their \nown territories. There are many different kinds of state. But yes, there is something \nfundamental that is underpinning all of these forms of political association. \n \nEmpire \n \nGL \nCan we move on now to talk about some of your recent research on empire, the dark side of \ndemocracy and so on? \n Starting with empire, you make the point that you don\u2019t go along with the Emmanuel \nTodd thesis that the US is not an empire or will not be not an empire for very long because of \nits own domestic weaknesses or because of the likelihood of a countervailing force or \nbecause of imperial overstretch. You\u2019ve made the point that the US Empire is actually \nstillborn, that it\u2019s incoherent, that the mission (the new mission) for imperialism is \nfundamentally incoherent because \u2018the U.S. is a military giant, an economic back seat driver, \na political schizophrenic and an ideological phantom\u2019.4 Can you just say a little bit more \nabout how you came to that description? \n \nMM \nWell I came to that conclusion from two general points drawn from my previous work. One \nfrom the Sources of Social Power is that in order to actually exercise power in general terms \none needs some combination of all four kinds of power: economic, ideological, military and \npolitical. Now, one doesn\u2019t need to have an equivalent amount of each, but one needs to have \nmore than just military power alone. That\u2019s the first point. The second point is my conviction \nthat this is no longer the age of empires, but the age of nation-states. \n Now I would qualify these in certain ways and, in fact, as the Iraq venture has gone \non, the US has realised the truth of the first statement and now has a political strategy which \nit didn\u2019t have before. It still doesn\u2019t have a genuine ideological strategy\u2014democratisation is \nsomething that appeals to its own domestic constituency rather than to the people of Iraq. It \nnow has a traditional political strategy of empire. And now that I know much more about \nAmerican history and previous periods (my comparisons previously were mainly with the \nBritish Empire and the Roman Empire about which I knew a fair amount and I saw that the \nUS was by no means similar to these), I can see that there are different kinds of empire: direct \nempire, indirect, informal, and then there is hegemony, which is not strictly empire. \n The US in the twentieth century, after the Philippines went bad, has been much more \nconcerned with informal empire, though laced with networks of bases and intermittent \npunitive interventions (there were thirty-two punitive and military interventions by the United \nStates between 1899 and 1929, for example, just about one a year, in order to keep client \nstates on the right path). Then there was a phase in which the US went for the policy of \u2018sons \nof bitches\u2019, that is as Cordell Hull, the former Secretary of State, put it (there is some \nargument about whether he was talking about Somoza or Trujillo) but he said, \u2018he may be a \nson of a bitch but he\u2019s our son of a bitch\u2019, where you work through proxies. This was the \n                                                 \n4 Michael Mann, Incoherent Empire (London: Verso, 2003). \n  \n \n12 \npredominant form of control during the Cold War (to begin with, of course, the Cold War \nwas rather hot because there was Korea and there was Vietnam, and there were various other \ninstances of fighting going on, but it gradually settled more into fighting through proxies). \nBut again, this tended to weaken. So I see structural adjustment programmes as the corollary \nof the dollar diplomacy of an earlier period, except that it didn\u2019t come about by punitive \ninterventions\u2014it\u2019s purely economic coercion along the lines of, \u2018if you do this, nothing bad \nwill happen to you. If you don\u2019t, you can\u2019t pay your debts\u2019. \n So there was a drift, as in empires in general, towards milder and milder forms of \ncontrol. And that\u2019s what the US has tried to buck in its Middle-Eastern policy because it is \nseeking if not a permanent empire then a very tough form of informal empire with bases \nthroughout the region and periods of interventions when necessary. I don\u2019t think that this will \nachieve anything. \n \nGL \nAnd it can\u2019t achieve anything for two reasons. One is that the IEMP equation doesn\u2019t add up. \nAnd the second point is that the macro-context won\u2019t allow it, because we are in the age of \nnation-states rather than the age of imperialism. In that case there can\u2019t be any empires in the \ncontemporary world, or at least any in the formal sense that you were talking about. \n \nMM \nYes. \n \nGL \nOne additional point I took from Incoherent Empire was that the reason why there can\u2019t be \nempires in the contemporary world is because states can\u2019t be nasty enough. They can\u2019t \noppress populations in the way that they did before, in that Guantanamo Bay may be bad but \nit\u2019s hardly on a par with the imperial slaughters of a hundred years ago and so on. \n \nMM \nYes. And also, because the insurgents have more powerful ideologies than they used to, \npunitive actions infuriate them rather than pacify them. You have less ability to divide \ninsurgents than through the punitive activities of the past. \n \nGL \nTwo other points that struck me about Incoherent Empire was that, first, it was overtly \npolitical, which seemed to mark some type of return to where we started\u2014your politically \nmotivated work in the early 1970s\u2014and I just wonder whether you felt that you needed to \nmake a political statement at this juncture, why that was and how that was received in the \nUnited States.  \n And second, you talk about part of the current problem in Iraq and with the US more \ngenerally as being the elevation of values to the political realm, and that the second-best \nworld of political action should always be governed by prudence rather than by overt norms. \nSo the real danger seems to lie in the fusion of ideological power with political power, and \nthat seems to lead on to your work on fascism and ethnic cleansing. Is that right? \n \nMM \nYes. Since I moved to the US, I have obviously been much less politically engaged than I \nwas in Britain. I\u2019m in an alien country. I\u2019ve only been a citizen since 1999, and Incoherent \nEmpire welled up rather quickly out of my horror and anger at what was going on in the two \ncountries in which I had citizenship. It hasn\u2019t gone down terribly well in the US. I would \n  \n \n13 \nhave hoped for broader circulation\u2014it was circulated among the left in the United States, but \nnot more generally. It\u2019s been more successful around other parts of the world and has been \nthrough a number of translations. \n Then there is the question of the dangerous blend of ideology, political power and \ntransformation. Yes, that\u2019s what\u2019s common in fascism, in ethnic cleansing and in \ncontemporary American policy. I\u2019ve become much more Machiavellian about what morality \nis\u2014that you can\u2019t have morals unless they can be made to work. What we find in almost all \nAmerican interventions is they don\u2019t start off with high moral values. They start off with a \nmore realist or prudential idea of national interest but then become converted into ethical \nventures. This has happened again in Iraq, though in this case the proponents of the war were \nmore ideological than is usually the case (although they didn\u2019t express this openly at first). Of \ncourse, if you can\u2019t achieve your aims, then the action is going to be immoral\u2014it will do \nmore damage and kill more people, and there\u2019s going to be more chaos as a result. \n \nThe Dark Side of Democracy \n \nGL \nMoving from this last point to the books on fascism and ethnic cleansing, there seem to be \nmore parallels in what you are saying about empire and your work on the dark side of \ndemocracy. For example, you make the point that fascism was in some ways a rational \nresponse to a systemic crisis but also a principled ideology in that it had a strong sense of \nvirtue and morality. In fact, it is that cocktail\u2014of reasoned response to a crisis fused with a \nconcept of virtue (as laid out by apologists such as Carl Schmitt)\u2014that gave fascism its real \nforce, hence the shared fascistic vision of an organic nationalism, a radical state, and so on. \n That seems to mean that there is a family resemblance between fascism, ethnic \ncleansing and perhaps empire as well, with the fundamental point being that none of these is \na sideshow to modernity, or democracy or \u2018civilisation\u2019, but that they are at the very heart of \nliberal democracy.  \n But isn\u2019t it those states which are most heavily institutionalised in liberal democracy \nthat have some kind of proof against fascism and murderous cleansing? So, in that case, is the \nvillain of the piece essentially nation-statism, particularly when it is fused with an overdose \nof moral purpose, rather than democracy? Or are we really talking about something intrinsic \nto democracy itself? \n \nMM \nWell, of course, I\u2019m going to have to spend a lot of time defending and explaining the title \nThe Dark Side of Democracy. I\u2019m not asserting that democracies directly commit ethnic \ncleansing, except in the case of settlers who want the land but not the labour, and that is the \nsituation in which they are\u2014colonial regimes\u2014most murderous. So it is the settlers who are \nthe most murderous. Their stake is in the local situation, and they are relatively unrestrained \nby the colonial government. \n \nGL \nSo, because of the distances involved, there\u2019s a genuine autonomy for those groups on the \nground. \n \nMM \nThat\u2019s right, and the more the settlers are in control of things, the more murderous they are. \n Now, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true about advanced countries themselves, and I don\u2019t think \nthat it\u2019s a characteristic of American democracy that these things are going on in Iraq. I think \n  \n \n14 \nthat, by and large, and this links up various things I\u2019ve said, that the most dangerous \nsituations come from instability, when unstable states are beset by crises (often caused by \nwider geopolitical crises), where there is factionalism within the domestic polity, where \nradicals can challenge incumbents, and where they can generate more violent \u2018solutions\u2019 to \nthese problems. That\u2019s more of a general situation than one rooted in either democracy or \nauthoritarianism. I think that stable democracies and stable authoritarian regimes are less \ndangerous than unstable ones. \n \nGL \nBut many stable regimes have performed horrific atrocities, particularly when this is linked to \nan extreme form of authoritarian nation-statism: Nazism, Stalinism or the Khmer Rouge \u2026 \n \nMM \nNo, I don\u2019t think that those regimes were particularly stable. There is a radicalisation process \nthat people have noted, for instance, about the Nazis, but the Nazis were the most extreme \nexample of an elite securely in power that continued to radicalise. The most murderous \ncommunist state was the Khmer Rouge, which emerged in the midst of a civil war and which \nbelieved that it was beset by all kinds of enemies. So, again, it\u2019s not a stable regime\u2014it\u2019s \ninstability that leads to the most difficulties. \n \nGL \nSo your warning seems to be about change and instability\u2014taking the example of \ndemocratisation, some people have studied the dangers of democratisation, particularly when \nit\u2019s done very quickly or when it involves a double transformation of economic systems and \npolities at the same time. \n But are you also making a wider, broader attack on, if you like, Western civilisation \nitself, in that you\u2019re following here a tradition of Weber and Adorno, the Frankfurt School, \nHannah Arendt, Mark Mazower, and so on, arguing that modernity and liberal democracy \nthemselves contain within them certain dangers? So forget the democratic peace and be \naware that murderous killing is at the heart of Western growth and development rather than \nsomething that happens out there to someone else or is somehow exceptional? \n \nMM \nYes\u2014murderous killing is at the heart of our civilisation, and each civilisation has its own \ndangers. I\u2019ve become rather relativist in thinking about progress. Is there progress? Well, in \nsome senses, of course, the answer is yes. But in each sequence of what we might call \nprogress there are new problems and new dangers, and a new dark side. So each society or \nsocial order has to solve its distinctive problems. \n There is a strong historical argument in my ethnic cleansing book which says that \npeople killed each other with very great frequency in previous epochs. But they tended not to \ncommit ethnic cleansing of the kind that modern societies do because ethnic cleansing only \nreally becomes an issue when we have the notion of rule by the people. This is the confusion \nof the ethnos with the demos. So, while fascism is clearly about nation-statism, underpinning \nit is an ideal. And this ideal is rule by the people. It takes many different forms, including \nfascism, which is, of course, an anti-democratic form. \n The point is that, in times of instability (when there is a generally perceived crisis \nwhere it\u2019s unclear what should happen), this is a context when ideologies appear that offer \nextreme \u2018solutions\u2019 to problems, \u2018solutions\u2019 which often involve violence. This is where the \ndanger of extremist ideologies without thought of consequences comes from and when \n  \n \n15 \nMachiavellian principles no longer rule. This is when the notion of the heaven, the will and \nthe force of the people can overcome all obstacles, the triumph over everything. \n In a way, this is common to the Nazis, to Leninist or to Maoist interpretations of \nMarxism, to the Khmer Rouge and in a much milder way to the neocons in the United States. \nBut much milder, I emphasise, as I don\u2019t want to compare them with the Nazis! \n \nGL \nAgain we have this link between macro-context, social action, various forms of social \norganisation and then what is transcendent and how different sources of power interweave \nand intertwine in a particular process or in a dynamic of world-historical development. \n In the third volume of Sources, which is on its way, the macro-context seems to be \nglobalisation, which clearly has all sorts of consequences for social organisation, political \naction, and so on. You\u2019ve made the point that globalisation is multiple, contradictory and \nviolent, and has a dark side to it (every macro-context or every civilisation seems to have this \ndark side or its contradictory element). \n But when I look at what you\u2019ve written about globalisation, you make the point, as \nwith empire, that the picture as served up by the IEMP model is uneven, that what is global is \nmatched by what is international, national, transnational and, indeed, sometimes local. Why \nthen describe the macro-context as globalisation at all? \n \nMM \nWell that\u2019s a very good question, and let me first of all explain that this third volume is still \nsome way off, and that I\u2019m still grappling with certain things. It may be that, in fact, the \nvolume is split into two, with the first part about empires and the second part about \nglobalisation. \n Let me say that I\u2019m increasingly unhappy with the standard writing on globalisation. \nThe core of it seems to be a supposed contradiction between nation-states and something else, \ncall it globalisation. Well, I don\u2019t see any weakening of nation states. On the other hand, I do \nsee a greater amount of activity in terms of the intensification of social relations around the \nworld, which you might want to call globalisation. So I do see an increasing intensification \nand density to social relations, just not at the expense of nation-states because states are \nactually becoming more invasive of our lives. The point is that this is going on at the same \ntime as some broader, sometimes global, processes that are also becoming more invasive of \nour lives. \n So, that said, I think one could defend the use of the term \u2018globalisation\u2019 and \u2018global\u2019 \nrelations if our social relations had reached the limits of the planet and then were bouncing \nback to influence us. And I think we\u2019ve definitely reached that in at least two areas\u2014\nweaponry (nuclear weapons and the like) and, the environment. In these two areas, the global \nprovides a constraint that changes social life. Clearly IR people know that nuclear weaponry \nchanged a great deal about the way that states related to each other. But the environment is \nsomething else entirely. \n Now, you can also say that there are many other processes\u2014that capitalism and \nculture, for example, are becoming more global\u2014but I would hesitate a little here because I \nfind that almost any generalisation one can make still has to have a geographical reference. \nWe may be talking about the North of the world or the South, or about continents, or about \nsmaller regions, such as the way that Nordic countries do things differently to the way that \nAnglo-Saxon liberal countries do things. So you have to do an awful lot of geographical \nqualifying of things that are often considered to be global but turn out to be exaggerations. \n On the other hand, the overall configuration is one that is far more global than it ever \nwas in the past, even though this has quite a long historical sequence. One might say that in \n  \n \n16 \nterms of nature, the environment, diet and things like that, the big impact is from the \nsixteenth to the eighteenth century rather than more recently. And the conquest of almost all \nof the world by a relatively small number of empires; this was a segmented form of \nglobalisation. So it still makes sense to talk about globalisation, but only given these caveats. \n \nGL \nMichael Mann\u2014thank you very much. \n \n \nGeorge Lawson is Lecturer in International Relations in the Department of Politics at \nGoldsmiths College, University of London \n \n"}
