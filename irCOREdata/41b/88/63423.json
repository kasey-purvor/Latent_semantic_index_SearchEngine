Loudon \nBritish Geological Survey, West Mains Road, Edinburgh EH9 3LA, U.K. \ne-mail: v.loudon@bgs.ac.uk \n \n \nPostprint of article in Computers & Geosciences, 26 (3A) April 2000, pp. A21-A29 \n \nAbstract - Once geoscientists have acquired basic computing skills, the next step in \nIT familiarization is generally to use IT methods to collaborate within a project. The \nproject is managed to achieve the objectives of a workgroup. Computers facilitate \ncommunication with e-mail, discussion groups and intranet links. There may be a \nneed to formalize: standards, metadata and investigational design for all contributors \nto share compatible results; procedures to monitor and control the project; and \ndocument and database design to deliver a uniform product. \n \nKey Words - Project support, workgroup communications, workgroup documents, \nmetadata, standards. \n \n \n1. Project and workgroup \n \nFew of us, even as students, work alone. After acquiring basic computing skills, the \nnext step is to look at the techniques for supporting a project and enabling a \nworkgroup to collaborate more effectively. Communication and preliminary planning \nare obviously important, as are databases and quantitative models. This leads on to the \nwider scene, where we recognize the global scope of geoscience and the pervasive \ninfluence of information technology. \n \nWe began (part C, section 2) by looking at the desktop computer. Without external \ndistractions, you can develop basic skills there, such as using a keyboard, a graphical \nuser interface and basic tools for preparing text, diagrams and data files. Most \ngeoscientists, however, must inevitably relate their own specialist expertise to the \nknowledge of others within a workgroup - a number of individuals brought together \nto work on a defined task. This creates additional requirements for information \ntechnology to assist in communication and coordination. \n \nTasks are normally handled as projects. A project is a managed activity with a set of \nobjectives and a time scale, normally with identified requirements for resources of \nstaff-time, equipment, services and information. The objective may be as small as the \nidentification of a fossil, or as large as the production of a geological map of the \nworld. A large project can be divided into subprojects. A very large project, say the \ngeological surveying of the United States, might be regarded as a service activity with \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part D  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nno final completion date. It would subsume many projects, concerned perhaps with \ncompletion of specific reports or map sheets. \n \nA project is defined within a business context rather than a purely scientific one. \nConsequently, the geoscience aspects would be designed and conducted differently \nfor, say, a project estimating sand and gravel resources compared with one looking for \noil and gas. Business is defined rather broadly as activities to meet the objectives of \nthe organization. A graduate research study, say, would reflect the \u201cbusiness\u201d of the \nuniversity in terms of research and education. Knowledge of the business context in \nwhich the project is undertaken is essential for others to evaluate the results obtained \nand their significance in other contexts. For example, core samples from oil \nexploration might not be representative of the area because they were selected as \npotential hydrocarbon-bearing rocks, possibly obtained from anticlines selected by \nseismic survey. \n \n2. Communicating in the workgroup \n \nCommunication between participants in a project can be improved by IT, and the \ncloser coordination can make work more productive. Where it is impossible or \nundesirable for all participants to be accommodated at the same location, IT can offer \ngood communication links over long distances (E 4). Tasks within a project can be \ndivided among a range of experts, all with their own computing needs and solutions. \nThey must combine their results and share their resources. Information must be \ntransferred between machines and must be usable when it arrives. The benefits of \nworking together, as well as the ability to make the results of the project available to \nothers, therefore depends on compatibility and consistency within the project and \ncomprehensibility to the outside world (H 2). \n \nIT offers a variety of communication methods, from the familiar telephone and fax to \ne-mail, file transfer, teleconferencing, distributed computing and project management \n(D 5). Communication can be between two individuals, one individual addressing a \ngroup, or discussion within a group (one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many). The \nmessage can be actively directed at specific recipients (push), or can be made \navailable, appropriately labeled, to be collected by anyone interested (pull). The \nexchange of information can be ephemeral or intended to provide a lasting record. It \nmay consist of speech, written text, images, data files or computer programs, and be \nrequired for reading as a paper document, for display on a computer screen, for \nstorage on the computer or on hard copy, or for computer analysis and manipulation. \nThere may be a need for interaction, possibly requiring instant response, or possibly a \nconsidered response at a later date. It may be necessary or desirable to limit access to \nthe information. Most of these needs are quite general, but the solutions depend on the \navailable technology. \n \nThe attributes of conventional methods of communication are familiar. Standards and \nprotocols are adopted, such as the behavior expected at an interview, the formality \nand sequence of a letter, the procedures, agenda, minutes and control of a meeting to \nensure orderly discussion. Similar requirements arise in electronic communication, \nbut may be resolved differently. \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part D  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nElectronic mail (E 4) communicates by means of messages entered at a keyboard. It \nautomatically transmits the sender\u2019s name and address, and a copy can be stored on \nthe sender\u2019s or recipient\u2019s own file, or on both. The recipient can read the message on \nthe screen, print it, forward it to others with or without added comments, and can \nreply without reentering the sender\u2019s address. Each message can be sent to an \nindividual, members of a group, addresses selected from a database, or a complete \nmailing list. Mailing lists can be typed in, acquired from other sources or built up \nfrom user requests. Computer-readable documents, including data files and computer \nprograms, can be sent by e-mail. Like the telephone, response can be immediate, or, \nlike ordinary mail, can be timed to meet the convenience of the sender. The inevitable \ndelays in handling paper documents, however, are partly overcome. Unlike fax, the \ninformation must be entered from a keyboard, which may make it more difficult to \ncreate a document, but is likely to make it easier to edit. \n \nAlthough e-mail was designed primarily for sending text, options are available to \nattach images, voice and video in multi-media systems. Other special-purpose systems \ninclude voicemail for storing and forwarding spoken messages, and teleconferencing \nin which a group can hold a discussion through videophones without assembling \nphysically at one location. Usenet provides discussion forums that are not limited to \none place, time or discipline. They can be deliberately restricted to project members, \nto nominated list of participants, or can be open to all. Entries can be selected, edited \nand controlled by the discussion leader, or circulated as received. Authors and their \naffiliations can be included at any level of detail, or entries can be anonymous. Those \nwith an interest in the subject can be asked to respond, can be invited to join the \nforum, or the existence of the forum can be publicized, with or without an invitation \nto register. \n \nTechniques like the Usenet, newsgroups and the World Wide Web (E 4) are directed \nprimarily at global rather than local communication. Nevertheless, their procedures \nand protocol can be used in a restricted setting, with the advantage of compatibility \nwith the wider world to which they may sooner or later be linked. The successful \nconcept of the intranet is based on similar reasoning, offering local connections with \nthe same software and characteristics as the Internet. These tools may assist in the \npreparation of documents and databases as a shared activity, with many contributors \nworking on them together. \n \n3. Sharing information, metadata \n \nThe ability to understand the work of others, including the language they speak, \ndepends on a shared coding scheme, that is, expressions of ideas and information \nwhich mean the same to the sender and the recipient.  This implies a shared \nbackground understanding. Outsiders may not be able to appreciate fully the results \nfrom a project because necessary background information is not available to them. It \nmust be explained at an appropriate level, explaining enough for features specific to \nthe project to be taken into account. For example, a petroleum geologist needs \nbackground information to evaluate core descriptions prepared by others during \ndevelopment of an oilfield. Information stating when the wells were drilled, the way \nthe core was obtained, when it was described, under what conditions, by whom, with \nwhat ends in view, would all help in the evaluation of the description.  \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part D  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nThese aspects, however, would not be part of the data (the description of the cores). \nRather they are metadata - data about the data - which may be helpful in their \ninterpretation (A 1). The fundamental feature of metadata is this ability to carry \ninformation at a higher level than the data, and so assist in their understanding. \nMetadata are often recorded formally, as on the title page of a book (author, title, \npublisher, date of publication, etc.), or on the legend of a map. Also, the header of a \ndownhole log records date, time and place, and is likely to include other information \nabout the type of logging tool and the characteristics of the drilling fluid, all of which \nhelp in the interpretation of the log itself. There is a hierarchy of metadata. \nInformation from the headings of downhole logs might be assembled as data in a \ndatabase, with higher-level metadata referring to the wells for which the suites of logs \nwere obtained. \n \nThe metadata that enable scientists to understand the work of others are not always \nexplicit. Understanding often depends on the expert who can infer from past \nexperience the significance and reliability of diverse sources of possibly conflicting \ninformation. In some cases, this expertise depends on knowledge of the techniques, \nprocedures, personalities and local background, much of which (if only to avoid libel \nsuits) would never be recorded. One effect of IT is to make information more widely \navailable and thus to separate it from local background knowledge. In these \ncircumstances, metadata that set out the constraints and limitations of data are \nincreasingly important.  \n \nStandards may be thought of in this context as specifications or definitions intended \nto be generally followed, established by agreement, custom or authority, to ensure \ninterchangeability, quality and reliability for least cost. They may be widely adopted \nfor methods, vocabulary, instrumentation and the like. Other things being equal, a \nstandardized approach has great benefits. Because projects have their own unique \nobjectives stemming from their business setting, they cannot all be conducted \nefficiently in the same way. Nevertheless, standards that are appropriate, available, \ncredible and relevant should clearly be used. The metadata should state which \nstandards were followed, for these change with time. They should describe any \ndeviations from these standards, and procedures specific to the project. If standards \nare unavailable or inappropriate, datasets should be described in detail, together with \ndetails of the project in which the data were collected. Much of this will be part of the \nproject report and not specifically identified as metadata. \n \nAnother view of metadata is taken by librarians, museum curators and archivists who \nare concerned with formal resource description. They tend to see metadata as offering \na brief description that can be used to catalog information (H 2). Yet another view is \ntaken by the database analyst who uses metadata to bring together information about \nspecific topics for subsequent analysis (L 5). There are widely diverse requirements \nfor metadata, and many solutions are adopted. \n \n4. Designing an investigation \n \nThere is an obvious need to plan any project. In some cases, the preliminary planning \nmay be only a broad outline that expands and develops during the investigation (J \n1.6). In other cases, a project based on a well-defined model may be planned in \nprecise detail before work starts. Some geophysical studies are like this. In the project \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part D  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \ndesign, it is important to be aware of relevant standards, and to use them where \nappropriate. Documentation should describe all datasets and aspects of the projects \nthat could assist in their interpretation.  \n \nOne task of most projects is to record the salient information, selected from the vast \namount that could be observed. This process of abstraction starts with the initial \nobservations and is directed towards explaining and throwing light on topics that bear \non the objectives. As described later (J 1), the outcome may be narrative and spatial \ndescriptions and explanations, which the scientist develops through directed \nobservation, and may involve quantitative models, which are likely to have a \nstatistical component.  \n \nThe statistical approach is mentioned here because some of the insights and \nvocabulary are widely relevant and because it calls for rigorous design of the \ninvestigation. The objectives of the project define the subject of interest and hence the \npopulation, or the total set of observations that might in principle be obtained about \nthe subject of interest. The procedures for making measurements and observations \n(operational definitions) should be on record, to make it easier to verify the results \n(see Krumbein and Graybill, 1965). The objectives, the hypotheses under \nconsideration, and past experience determine the procedures in an investigation. The \nprocedures for deciding when and where measurements are made can be defined as a \nsampling scheme.  \n \nIt is obviously impossible to make all possible observations, and so we seek a \nrepresentative portion (a sample) from which we can draw conclusions about the \nproperties of the whole population, and about the degree of uncertainty which is \ninevitable in making such inferences. A rigorous sampling scheme is essential to \nmake a valid statistical interpretation of a set of measurements (see, for example, \nGriffiths, 1967 or Davis, 1973). The measurements are expected to throw light on \nsomething specific (the target population). For example, if the purpose is to \ndetermine the overall content of uranium within a black shale unit and to map its \nregional variation, then the investigation should be designed with that in mind. \nRemembering that it is not possible to sample those parts of the shale unit that have \nbeen eroded away, and that it may not be practicable to sample those that are not \nexposed, the available (potentially accessible) population is greatly reduced. There \nmay be some outcrops that are inaccessible in practice, reducing the available \npopulation further. Some will be easier to get at than others, and some samples can \ntherefore be obtained at lower cost than others. A variable sampling density, if well \ndesigned, can be allowed for in subsequent analysis. \n \nThe procedures will inevitably change as the project proceeds and more is learned. \nThe modifications should be recorded. In all projects it is helpful to ask from time to \ntime whether the procedures of investigation introduce an unintended bias. If \nstatistical arguments are used, do the sampling procedures give a representative, \nrandom sample? Is the sample representative of the population of interest, and the \nsampling density sufficient to support the conclusions? The sampling procedure \nshould not be unnecessarily complicated, but must be devised to avoid misleading \nresults. The procedures should be fully documented so that all participants can follow \nthem and others can repeat the procedures to verify your results. \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part D  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nAnother design issue that is troublesome in most projects is whether the objectives \ncan be met with the available resources, such as time, manpower, information and \nequipment. This is considered next. \n \n5. Project management \n \nIt is easier to estimate the resources required for small tasks than for a complex \nproject. By breaking down the planned project into a series of steps, you can estimate \nthe demands of each task separately. Records of similar completed projects may help, \nif you can find them. Project management software can then calculate the total \nresource requirements. Simple presentations such as the Gantt chart (Fig. 1) help to \nmonitor progress, and ensure that participants know what must be done in what order \nand on what time-scale. Some systems allow individuals to maintain their own \nrecords, and combine them as a central record of progress for the project as a whole. \n \n \n \nFig. 1. Gantt chart for recording progress within a project. The work of the project is subdivided into \ntasks, making it easier to plan and monitor progress. Horizontal bars show the duration and time \nrelationships of the tasks. \u201cMilestones\u201d, such as dates for authorization of procedures, seminars, or \ndelivery of reports, can be shown as symbols on the bar. Individual contributions may be identified \nseparately and linked to the contributor\u2019s other commitments. The final documents can be extensive, \nand only a fragment is shown here. \n \nFor a very large project or closely linked set of projects, critical path analysis (CPA) \ntechniques may be useful. They are concerned with subdividing the project into a \nnumber of tasks and estimating the effort to complete each. Time dependencies \nbetween tasks are identified. For instance, samples must be collected before they can \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part D  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nbe analyzed. The tasks can be placed in sequence, and by comparing estimates of the \neffort needed with the resources available, completion dates for each task can be \nestimated.  The critical path through the network of tasks links those that determine \nthe shortest overall time to complete the project. To meet that completion date, the \nlatest time for completion of any task, whether on the critical path or not, can be \ncalculated and the consequences of any delay can be assessed. \n \nDespite project size increasing (thanks to IT support) few geoscience projects are so \ncomplex and time-sensitive that they warrant critical path analysis. However, the \ntechnique is of interest to geoscientists for another reason. It is a means of recording \nevents of many distinct kinds that occur in succession within the same time frame. \nThe time taken by a process leading from one event to another may be quantifiable, or \nin some cases may be unknown. Before and after relationships can be incorporated \nwhere they are known, whether or not they refer to the same kind of event. The \nsoftware for critical path analysis can thus be applied to geological activities, \nprocesses and events as well as human ones. It can be applied to stratigraphic \nrelationships, linking events such as the start and end of deposition of formations, \ntectonic events, fossil ranges, and the like. The mathematical framework is called \ngraph theory and is concerned with networks, their properties and their visualization. \n \nManagement of a project can be assisted by IT. It provides an effective means for \nmembers of the workgroup to keep in touch. Assuming that they are connected by a \nnetwork, such as an intranet, bulletins can be posted centrally, or can be distributed by \ne-mail, to give all concerned immediate access to developments within the project. \nSoftware is available for maintaining individual diaries and records of time spent on \nvarious aspects of the project. All participants can update their section of a shared \nmovement sheet so that they can be contacted while out of the office, and meetings \ncan be arranged at a time suitable for all. The computer system is being used as a \ndevice to improve social interaction. But, while the project as a whole may gain, \nindividuals may lose some freedom of movement. There is therefore a risk of \nsubversion by unwilling participants. An enforcer, such as the project leader\u2019s \nsecretary, may be needed to ensure timely and accurate input.  \n \n6. Project documents \n \nWhen a workgroup, rather than an individual, prepares project documents, word \nprocessing enables each of several authors to contribute sections, and the principal \nauthor to fit them together and edit as necessary. The editing process is made easier \nby facilities such as red-lining, which enables the editor to mark up the document, to \nindicate suggested changes and add annotations without obscuring the original \nwording (Fig. 2).  \n \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part D  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \n \n \nFig. 2. \u201cRed-lining\u201d in editing a document. This enables reviewers to annotate and suggest changes \nwithout obscuring the original wording.  \n \nSome sections of a project document, notably the references and table of contents, \nmay have contributions from all the authors, and all may take part in the editing \nprocess. With a large and complex document, it may be helpful to set up a formal \nstructure for the sections of the document, to clarify where responsibilities lie and \nsimplify the task of building a single coherent document. The SGML approach to \nstructuring a document (E 6) is particularly relevant if it is to be archived. The SGML \nmark-up language separates content from presentation (specified by a style sheet), and \nthus makes it possible to present aspects of the work in different ways for different \naudiences. It also subdivides the document into identifiable sections, which can be \ncataloged and retrieved separately, and possibly reused in other contexts. The \nproduction of a hypermedia document might be considered, with the possibility of \nlinking in maps, photographs, models, datasets and video records. The potential \nadvantages are described in L 6.3 where the drawbacks of publishing in this form are \nalso mentioned. \n \nIT can also provide the means for integrating the data collected for various aspects of \na project. A simple database can be built up using the tools available on the desktop \ncomputer. On-screen forms can be designed (Fig. 3) for entering data on any topic. \nLinks between topics can also be created. For example, the results of a geochemical \nanalysis could be related to the specimen from which the sample was analyzed, and \nthis linked in turn to a description of a thin section cut from the same specimen. The \nlinkage, however, must be part of the design of the investigation. The organization of \nthe database (H 3) stems from the way in which the data are collected. The \nrelationships between data items can be depicted on a diagram (Fig. 4) which shows \ntypes of data (entities), attributes and relationships. These entity-relationship \ndiagrams can be quite complex, and can include data from many sources. The layout \nof a database can be generated from such diagrams using computer-aided support \nenvironment (CASE) tools. At the level of a project, however, a simple diagram \nshould be sufficient, perhaps prepared on a computer drafting system to avoid the \ntedium of correcting hand-drawn diagrams. \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000.

More on the \u201cEpicentre model\u201d at http:\/\/www.posc.org\/ \n \nData are frequently stored in the form of tables, and can thus be treated as a \nspreadsheet. This structure can also be referred to as a flat file or a two-dimensional \narray. Quantitative data held as a table is known in algebra as a matrix (F 4). The \nobvious reason for this arrangement is that each column can hold records of \nmeasurements of a particular variable, and each row can hold the information for a \ndifferent item. This assumes that the same variables are measured for each item. The \nvariation within each variable can be studied separately, including perhaps their \nspatial distribution, but it is also possible to see how the different variables are \ninterrelated (F 5). A number of different tables are required to cope with different \ntopics, such as petrographic descriptions, lithological descriptions, geochemical \nanalyses and so on. There can, however, be links between them. For example, the \nanalyses may come from the same borehole, from the same location, or even from the \nsame specimen. Care is therefore needed to ensure that the data records are not only \nconsistent within tables, but also between tables (H 3). \n \nThe purpose of creating project documents is to make them available to others within \nor outside the project, and to organize the information for further analysis. IT opens \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part D  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nup new possibilities of analysis, and formalizes structures for holding the data. These \nare considered later. \n \n7. IT applications in the cycle of project activities \n \nIt is essential to think of IT support for projects from a number of viewpoints, and \nadopt the one best suited to the task in hand. It may help at this stage to look at the \ncycle of activities involved in a geoscience project, and indicate the types of IT \nsupport available for each activity. This may serve (at the risk of repetition) to remind \nthe user of the available applications and how they fit together - a shop window of IT \ntechniques where the potential user can browse and decide where to look further. \nThey are arranged as an idealized set of activities (M 1) for carrying out a geoscience \nproject (I 8.1), such as a gravity survey, preparing a soil map, or identifying a batch of \nfossil specimens. \n \nThe first activity might be to clarify the objectives of the project, determine the \nresources available, and plan its execution. The next activity could be to find existing, \nrelevant information. Then data might be collected in the field or the laboratory. The \ndata would be classified, analyzed and explained, perhaps by means of a computer \nmodel. The results would be presented, with visualization where appropriate. They \nwould be discussed with others and their broad implications taken into account. They \ncould then be reviewed, revised, edited as necessary, and published or otherwise made \navailable to the intended audience.  \n \nReal life, of course, is not like that. Activities overlap and some may not be \nrecognizable at all. The cycle of activities as a whole, and subcycles within it, may be \nrepeated many times before the project is over. Initial results, for instance, may lead \nto revising the plan and calling for more resources. The scheme, which follows, is an \nidealized model with some features at least in common with a real project.  \n \n7.1 Planning, analysis and project management \n \nAn exploratory project by one individual may need little formal planning, ad hoc \ndecisions being taken as the project proceeds. But a project using scarce resources and \nembedded in a larger investigation may require appropriate results on a tight time \nscale, and therefore need careful planning and rigid control. Computer support is \nlikely to include word processing, spreadsheets and business graphics. \n \nCommunication can be assisted and formalized with programs specifically designed \nfor project management. Methods include: \n\u2022 Electronic mail and word processing for communication and preparation of \nproject documents (D 2, C 3) \n\u2022 Diaries, movement sheets and time planners to allocate staff resources, plan \nmeetings and monitor progress (D 5) \n\u2022 Spread-sheets to support costing and allocation of resources, such as staff time \nand equipment, and to monitor usage and costs (C 4) \n\u2022 Gantt charts or critical path analysis to schedule tasks, identify milestones, \nmonitor progress and adjust priorities (D 5) \n \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part D  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \n \n7.2 Desk studies, literature search, archive search \n \nThe preliminary desk study assembles relevant existing material from available \nsources. Consider whether the value of old information justifies the cost of retrieving \nit, or whether collecting new information might be more cost-effective. \n\u2022 On-line Public Access Catalogs (OPACs) can help with searching for \nreferences in your local library, or if need be, in major libraries throughout the \nworld (H 2) \n\u2022 Citation indexes can extend the search forwards in time from known sources \n(H 2) \n\u2022 Searching the World Wide Web may yield useful information (E 4) \n\u2022 Other workers in the same topic area may respond to e-mail or Usenet \ninquiries (E 4, D 2) \n\u2022 Computer indexes to archives and repositories may be searchable remotely (H \n3) \nMuch of this information will have been prepared by librarians and should be in a \nsuitable form for adding to your own lists of references (H 2). \n \n7.3 Field and laboratory data collection \n \nMany instruments in the laboratory or in the field, including much geophysical and \noceanographic equipment, will automatically deliver digital, computer-compatible \nrecords. Data collection methods may even be adjusted automatically to conform to a \nresponsive computer model. A quick comparison of cost, accuracy and time-saving \nwill show whether this is worth while. Some thought should be given to the ultimate \nuse of the data, and to the interfaces that enable it to reach the point where it is needed \n(such as a database) in an appropriate form. The computer does not necessarily make \nthis easier. A number of alternative routes to acquiring data might be considered.  \n\u2022 Rigorously organized data, say for the collection of stream sediments for \ngeochemical analysis, or for description of shallow boreholes, might be \ncollected with preprinted forms or with prompt sheets (C 5), and the data later \ndigitized manually or mechanically.  \n\u2022 The same procedure can be followed, but entering data directly to a computer \nor data recorder in the field (C 5).  \n\u2022 Electronic theodolites and range finders and Global Positioning System \nequipment (C 5) can assist field mapping and locating instrument stations.  \n\u2022 The data may be recorded for later entry, or the map can be plotted, edited and \nstored electronically in the field (C 5).  \n\u2022 Points, lines and symbols can be drawn in the field over a conventional base \nmap, an air photograph or a satellite image. They can later be scanned or \nmanually digitized, and the distortions corrected by computer (G 1, G 2). \n \n7.4 Explanation, classification, modeling \n \nAlthough the intuition and expertise of the human brain are essential in developing \nexplanations, IT can assist the process by assembling, codifying, manipulating, \nanalyzing and presenting the supporting information. \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part D  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \n\u2022 Descriptive statistics, such as the averages of measured values, can readily be \ncalculated, and X-Y plots drawn to look at possible correlations (F 3).  \n\u2022 Multivariate statistics can be computed which may throw light on complex \nrelationships that would not otherwise be revealed (F 5).  \n\u2022 Numerical taxonomy offers procedures, such as cluster analysis, for \nclassifying large numbers of items on the basis of their measured properties (F \n5).  \n\u2022 Explanations may involve computer models (F 3, J 2.3), particularly in areas \nlike geophysics or engineering geology, where the underlying relationships \ncan be related to the laws of physics. \n\u2022 Data analysis of the entities investigated in geoscience, and their relationships, \nmay lead to diagrams, drawn and edited on the computer, which help to \nexplain the structure of the information as well as encouraging a more \nconsistent approach (H 3).  \n\u2022 Explanations that would conventionally be presented as a written report can be \ngiven greater depth with hypermedia. Through access to additional \nbackground, such as video demonstrations, the reader can link the explanation \nto the supporting evidence (J 1.5).  \n\u2022 Techniques derived from studies of machine intelligence can formalize aspects \nof geoscientists\u2019 thought processes (L 5). These can be built into expert \nsystems that can then apply the reasoning to other geoscience information. \n \n7.5 Visualization, presentation \n \nGeoscience is concerned with spatial processes and their interaction with geological \nobjects through geological time and space. The importance of maps, cross-sections \nand block diagrams is therefore not surprising. Computer cartography plays a large \npart in the production of the maps. They can be regarded as an aspect of computer \nvisualization, a subject that explores the application of graphical methods to the \nunderstanding of data. \n\u2022 Bar charts, pie charts, and x-y plots (C 4) can help the user to grasp the \nrelative frequencies and correlation of variables.  \n\u2022 Digital cartography and spatial models can show the pattern of variables in \nspace, their spatial relationships and spatial correlation (G 1, G 2).  \n\u2022 Geographic information systems (L 4) and visualization systems (E 5, G 7) \nprovide a more flexible means of displaying two and three-dimensional \nrelationships than the conventional approach of examining and overlaying \nmaps \n\u2022 Hypertext and hypermedia systems make it possible to combine and cross-\nrefer between text, images, models and map information in a more flexible \nmanner (L 6).  \n\u2022 Portable display systems make it possible to present live demonstrations of \nmultimedia to a large audience, through a suitable projector (C 6). \n \n7.6 Reconciling information and aligning ideas \n \nA significant part of the time spent on an investigation may be devoted to resolving \nconflicts between differing views, possibly within a project, possibly between ideas \narising from different projects. The IT contribution to these debates is to provide \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part D  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \ndiscussion forums, with faster response and greater convenience, accuracy and global \nreach than conventional methods.  \n\u2022 E-mail (E 4), the Usenet (D 2), and the World Wide Web (E 4) are means of \ncommunication which meet different needs.  \n\u2022 The process of seeking the views of others, as in tendering for new facilities or \nin setting standards, can be formalized as Requests for Technology and \nRequests for Comment. A good example is the procedures followed by POSC \n(L 5).  \n\u2022 Digitized information from several sources, such as photographs, satellite \nimagery, and geological and geophysical maps, can be linked, adjusted to fit, \ncompared and integrated on a computer screen (L 4). \n\u2022 Teleconferencing allows a small group to see one another on screen and \nparticipate in the same discussion from different locations, or can make it \npossible for an individual to address a group of any size from another location. \nThe advantage over a video recording is that the speaker can respond \nimmediately to audience reaction and questions. \n\u2022 IT encourages the separation of metadata and standards from other \ninformation (L 6.1), thus assembling key reference information where all can \nconsult it. In this way, greater consistency of data should be achievable, and \nany disputes about nomenclature or standards can be placed immediately \nbefore the relevant authority or submitted to an appropriate forum. \n \n7.7 Review, revision, editing \n \nThere are obvious advantages to scientific editors and publishers in receiving material \nby disk or e-mail. It can be forwarded without delay to referees for consideration or \ncomment, without the cost and inconvenience of handling and mailing photocopies. \nComments can be marked up as an integral part of the text (D 6), and alternative \nversions directly compared. The author can incorporate agreed changes without \nretyping the rest of the text. The publisher can pass the finished work directly to the \nplate-maker and avoid the process of rekeying with the inevitable errors and \nadditional corrections that this must introduce. Most publishers must obtain or prepare \ncomputer-readable copy for their printer\u2019s phototypesetters, and may also wish to \nmake an electronic version of the paper available to customers as an alternative to \npaper (M 2.1). \n \nDocuments prepared within a project, and multi-author papers generally, can benefit \nfrom IT methods, particularly if the authors are geographically dispersed. E-mail can \nbe helpful in exchanging ideas rapidly, but it is also possible to create project-centered \ndocuments (D 6) which are accessible to all the authors, with agreed protocols for \nreading, writing or amendment. Similar multi-author procedures for describing, \ndrawing, reviewing and amending diagrams and maps are possible using GIS software \n(L 4). \n \nDocuments, including maps (G 1), that are subject to rapid change and development, \nmay not be published conventionally, but instead an electronic record can be archived \non the computer and kept up to date. When a copy is required, the latest version can \nbe made available. Changes can be logged and earlier versions recreated if need be. \nIn-house documents, and those with limited circulation, may never be published \nconventionally but can simply be stored on the computer for access on demand. \nLoudon, T.V., 2000.
