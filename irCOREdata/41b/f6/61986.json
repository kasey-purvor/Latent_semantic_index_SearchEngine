Lett., 35, L11605, doi:10.1029\/2008GL033459.\n[2] It has been known for over thirty years [Simpson and\nHunter, 1974; Simpson, 1981] that on wide, tidally ener-\ngetic continental shelves spatial variations in the level of\ntidal mixing leads in summer to a well defined patchwork of\nstratified (two layer) and vertically homogeneous waters\nseparated by sharp horizontal boundaries. The discovery of\nthese tidal mixing fronts led to speculation that there should\nbe strong frontal jets parallel to the surface temperature\nfront, but early attempts to find these failed. Instead, our\npicture of long-term circulation on the European shelf has\nbeen based on the presumption that it is driven by episodic\nstorms and is generally weak [Simpson, 1981] when aver-\naged over a month or more. Indeed, in the absence of any\nsystematic observations simple schematic circulation car-\ntoons have had considerable currency.\n[3] Between 1994 and 2005 we conducted a series of\nmeasurements in most parts of the northwest European shelf\n(see Table 1). Our observations, combined with those of\nothers, now include descriptions of the western English\nChannel [e.g., Vanhoutte-Brunier et al., 2008], Celtic Sea\n[e.g., Brown et al., 2003], Irish Sea [e.g., Hill et al., 1996;\nHorsburgh et al., 2000], western Irish shelf [e.g., Fernand\net al., 2006], western [Hill et al., 1997] and northern\nScottish shelf, the northern [e.g., Turrell, 1992] and central\nNorth Sea [e.g., Brown et al., 2001] and the Skagerak. We\nundertook (a) deployments of satellite tracked drifting\nbuoys (mostly drogued at 20\u201330 m below the sea surface);\n(b) extensive high horizontal spatial resolution (<1 km) ship\nsurveys of water column density structure using towed,\nundulating conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) systems\nand; (c) measurements of the vertical and horizontal struc-\nture of currents using ship-borne acoustic Doppler current\nprofilers (ADCP).\n[4] Each year, from about May to October, large areas of\nthe European shelf seas stratify as surface waters are\nwarmed (Figure 1). A sharp seasonal pycnocline (density\ninterface) is maintained by wind and tide generated turbu-\nlence, from the surface downwards and the sea bed upwards\nrespectively. Below the seasonal pycnocline, extensive\npools of cold, dense bottom water left over from the\nprevious winter are trapped. The temperature of this bottom\nwater is established, prior to isolation, by surface heat\nexchange during winter and early spring and thereafter\nwarms only very slowly (e.g., 2\u0001C over 200 days) after\nthe onset of stratification. In addition, in areas of the shelf\nclosest to the open ocean, the \u2018cold pool\u2019 waters below the\nseasonal pycnocline are also more saline (>35.3) owing to\nthe penetration of salty oceanic waters onto the shelf.\n[5] Inshore from the dense pools trapped below the\nseasonal pycnocline, in areas of the shelf where the water\ndepth (h) is relatively shallow, and\/or where depth-averaged\ntidal currents (U) are large, the water column remains\nvertically mixed by tidal stirring [Simpson and Hunter,\n1974; Simpson, 1981] throughout the year. Characteristically\non the European Shelf this occurs where log10 h\/U\n3 > 2.7.\nFurther inshore where freshwater influence is more preva-\nlent, stratification is intermittent depending on levels of\nfreshwater discharge. These regions (shown schematically\nto the right of the dotted line in Figure 1) are not considered\nin this paper.\n[6] The offshore dense pools are typically bounded by\nsharp horizontal temperature and\/or salinity gradients (bot-\ntom fronts) with a horizontal scale of approximately twenty\nkilometres. At tidal mixing fronts there is usually both a\nsurface front and a bottom front, the latter usually being the\nmore pronounced in terms of density gradient. However,\nelsewhere bottom fronts can exist without a surface front\nbeing present. Whilst surface fronts have received much\nattention in shelf seas (e.g., they are visible in satellite\nimages), it is the hidden bottom fronts that are the most\nsignificant in dynamical terms. On account of the largely\nstatic nature of the cold\/salt pools the bottom density\ngradient is expected, by thermal wind balance, to drive a\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 35, L11605, doi:10.1029\/2008GL033459, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, University of\nSouthampton Waterfront Campus, Southampton, UK.\n2British Oceanographic Data Centre, Liverpool, UK.\n3CEFAS Lowestoft Laboratory, Suffolk, UK.\n4Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, Liverpool, UK.\n5Martin Ryan Institute, National University of Ireland, Galway, Galway,\nIreland.\n6FRS Marine Laboratory Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/08\/2008GL033459$05.00\nL11605 1 of 5\nnear surface geostrophic jet located above the region of\nmaximum horizontal density gradients and with a flow\ndirection that is cyclonic (i.e., with the dense bottom water\nto the left of the direction of flow in the northern hemi-\nsphere). With horizontal density gradients of 0.4 kg m\u00013 per\n10 km, a characteristic jet velocity 50 m above the bed\nwould be 0.2 m s\u00011. Apart from limitations in observing\ntechnology at the time, we now understand that it was the\nfocus on surface fronts rather than the bottom fronts that\nexplains why the search for frontal jets in the 1970s was\nfruitless. It is only now that we can assemble the full picture\nof both the thermohaline structure and circulation of the\nshelf seas.\n[7] A representative summer near-bed temperature field\nhas been derived from a high-resolution (1.8 km) simulation\n[Holt and Proctor, 2008] of the European continental shelf\nusing the POLCOMS three-dimensional model with 34 s-\ncoordinate vertical levels. This model has been shown to\nreproduce the seasonal variability of northwest European\nshelf sea tidal mixing fronts in good agreement with\noceanographic observations [Holt and Umlauf, 2008]. An\nearlier validation run of the model [Holt et al., 2001], which\nexcluded the effects of a time-varying oceanic density field,\ngenerated density-driven flows in reasonable agreement\nwith the drifter observations described here. The surface\nboundary conditions were provided by the ERA40 meteo-\nrological reanalysis data from the European Centre for\nMedium Range Weather Forecasting. The simulation was\nfor 2001 with oceanic lateral boundary conditions provided\nby a multi-year run of a wide domain version of the same\nTable 1.

Direct measurements of the density\nfield, combined with measurements of flow from shipborne\nADCP, and geostrophic (thermal wind) velocities confirms\nthat the density field associated with the bottom fronts\naccounts for the observed drifter velocities [e.g., Brown et\nal., 2003; Horsburgh et al., 2000; Fernand et al., 2006; Hill\net al., 1997].\n[8] Further confirmation of the significance of density\ndriven circulation on the European shelf, as a fraction of the\ntotal long term flow, comes from manipulation of three\nnumerical model runs with (a) full forcing, (b) wind and\nFigure 2.

By subtraction, it is possible to partition the circulation\ninto that due to the local evolution of the density field (the\nred bars in Figure 3), the surface wind stress (blue bars), and\nthe effect of the oceanic lateral boundary conditions (green\nbars). The volume transports depicted in Figure 3 are\nsummer averages (July \u2013September) calculated over\nsections normal to the density gradients at the stated\nlocations. It is clear that the density driven component is\nprevalent in all of those areas where we have identified jets\nassociated with bottom fronts.\n[9] A first order estimate of the total volume transport (Q)\nof water associated with jets above bottom fronts can be\nobtained from a two-layer analytical model (Figure 1) that\nassumes a horizontal pycnocline at depth h0 separates light\nsurface waters of density r-Dr from a bottom dense pool of\ndensity r. With gravitational acceleration (g), total depth H,\nand Coriolis parameter f (accounting for earth rotation) the\ntotal transport is\nQ \u00bc gDr\n2rf\nH2 \u0001 h20\n\u0001 \u0002\n[10] Typical values for shallow, mid-latitude continental\nshelves are: Dr = 0.4 kg m\u00013, H = 80 m, h0 = 30 m, f =\n10\u00014 s\u00011, giving Q = 0.1 \u0003 106 m3s\u00011, easily the most\ndominant contributor to persistent transports from late\nspring to autumn.\n[11] The horizontal transport above a bottom front, and\nthe area of retention within the dense pool, influence the\nspatial heterogeneity of ecosystems and habitats within\nshallow seas. For instance, on the European shelf, species\nsuch as Nephrops exploit the area of retention in order to\nkeep larvae above a suitable substrate for post-larval settle-\nment [Hill et al., 1996], while species such as herring\nexploit the jets in order to transport larvae from spawning\ngrounds to nursery areas [Turrell, 1992]. The fronts form\nnatural boundaries between eco-regions, as the area of\nretention is often characterised by deposition of soft organic\nsediment, while the frontal region is associated with higher\nproductivity. These features are important when considering\nthe division of shallow seas into biologically relevant\nmanagement units, as required by the developing ecosystem\napproach to the sustainable use of marine resources.\n[12] The density-driven currents we have found are\nconnected on a shelf-wide scale and provide a continuous\ntransport route from the French coastal region via the Celtic\nshelf and west of Ireland to the Scottish shelf (Figure 4).\nThis pathway is potentially a conveyor belt for contami-\nnants and plankton. For example, we note that blooms of\nseveral harmful algal species (e.g., Karenia mikimotoi and\nAlexandrium tamarense) consistently occur along these\nfeatures, impacting aquaculture whenever local events force\nthem onto the coast [e.g., Vanhoutte-Brunier et al., 2008;\nBrown et al., 2001]. It is likely that the shelf-wide circula-\ntion regime has existed since deglaciation (8000 years ago)\nand has thus influenced both the evolution of shelf sea\necosystems and the deposited geological record.\n[13] Just as the oceanic thermohaline circulation is now\nreceiving more attention than the wind-driven flow, we have\nshown that the thermohaline circulation of shelf seas is\nequally important. The recognition that density-driven\nfrontal jets are the most significant contributor to seasonal\nshelf transport allows a better assessment of the impact of\nclimate change on this dominant circulation mode. For\nexample, changes which result in weaker gradients across\nbottom fronts (e.g., warmer winters, and\/or cooler summers)\nwill weaken the circulation, while changes which result in\nstronger gradients will increase it. Even on inter-annual time\nscales we can observe significant changes. In the northern\nNorth Sea, between 1975 and 2005, the average (\u00b1s.d.)\nannual summer density difference across the bottom-front\nwas 0.69 (\u00b10.26) kg m\u00013, which implies an average density-\ndriven transport in this region of 0.24 (\u00b10.09) \u0003 106 m3s\u00011,\nrepresenting a variability of approximately \u00b140% (see\nauxiliary material).1\n[14] Another possible outcome of climate change is warm-\ning of the tidally energetic Arctic shelves [Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change, 2007], which would then become\nmore like the temperate shallow seas of the European\ncontinental shelf. In this case bottom frontal features\nwould become more evident in Arctic seas, and hence their\ncirculation more vigorous. Since such a large proportion of\nmarine biomass production occurs within shelf seas, coupled\necosystem-hydrodynamic models should now focus on the\nscales and processes discussed here in order to clarify the\necological impact of any climate change.\nFigure 4.

Effective long-term observa-\ntion systems in our shallow seas must account for this\nphenomenon. We recommend that continuous measurement\nof near-bed density at key locations, combined with data\nassimilation into a suitable numerical model, would provide\nan appropriate monitoring capability for shelf sea transport\nand its variability. We know that many spatially extensive\ncontinental shelves (e.g., off north-eastern China [Hu et al.,\n1991], Argentina [Glorioso, 1987] and parts of the Arctic\n[Golenko et al., 2003]) have the same thermohaline struc-\ntures as reported here, but that the circulation patterns have\nnot been measured. We predict that jet circulations will be\nubiquitous on temperate shelves, and recommend that their\npresence is investigated and their effects examined.\n[16] Acknowledgments.
