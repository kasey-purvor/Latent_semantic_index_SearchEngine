INTRODUCTION\nThe Kibble mechanism\n1\nis expected to operate when a system passes\nsu\u000eciently fast through a continuous phase transition. It results in the for-\nmation of topological defects because of an event horizon whereby small\nregions of new phase are initially formed out of causal connection with each\nother. It was introduced in connection with the grand uni\fed theory (GUT)\nsymmetry-breaking phase-transition in which cosmic strings\n2\nare believed\n3\nto have been created in the early Universe. Later, Zurek pointed out\n4{6\nthat closely analogous behaviour is to be anticipated when liquid\n4\nHe passes\nthrough its lambda (super\ruid) transition, resulting in the creation of quan-\ntized vortex lines, the super\ruid analogue of cosmic strings. He estimated\nthe vortex density to be anticipated, in terms of the timescale of the passage\nthrough the transition.\nThe lambda transition cannot, in practice, be traversed quickly by iso-\nbaric temperature reduction, because of the well known speci\fc heat sin-\nPublished in J.

Zurek pointed out,\n4{6\nhowever, that an adiabatic expansion\nof He I through the transition could in principle be e\u000bected rapidly. The\n\frst such experiment\n7\nseemed to show vortex creation at approximately the\npredicted density. Later, however, a re\fned version of the experiment\n8,9\nled to the conclusion that the initial results had been misleading because\nof inadvertent vortex creation caused by nonidealities of the expansion pro-\ncess (resulting in bulk \row): it was concluded that there was no measurable\nvortex creation at all. Any vortices being produced were apparently at a\ndensity at least 100 times smaller than expected.\nThese results are not matched by those obtained from other systems.\nIn particular, phase transitions in liquid crystals\n10{12\nand in liquid\n3\nHe\n13,14\nhave been shown to result in extensive defect formation at densities consist-\ngent with the theoretical predictions. The reason why the Kibble mechanism\nshould work in liquid crystals and liquid\n3\nHe, but apparently not in liquid\n4\nHe, is not known. One possible explanation\n15\ninvolves the e\u000bect of thermal\n\ructuations very close to the transition, tending to unwind the order param-\neter; it is also possible that the vortices decay too fast to be observed.\n16,17\nThe situation remains unclear and further experimental input is highly de-\nsirable.\nWe discuss below some ways in which the\n4\nHe experiment might be\nfurther enhanced so as to make it more sensitive to any vortex creation that\ndoes occur. Section 2 outlines the operation of the present expansion sys-\ntem. Section 3 discusses ways in which a faster passage through the lambda\ntransition might be achieved, and other possible enhancements; Section 4\nsummarises the discussion and draws conclusions.\n2. THE PRESENT\n4\nHe EXPERIMENT\nThe experiment has already been described in detail,\n9\nbut we outline\nbrie\ry the salient features relevant to the present discussion.\nThe underlying idea\n4\nis quite simple. A small isolated volume of He-I is\ninitially held at pressure P\ni\n, and temperature T\ni\n, just above the temperature\nT\n\u0015\n(P\ni\n) of the \u0015-transition. The arrangement is shown schematically in Fig. 1.\nThe liquid is held in a disk-shaped cell whose cylindrical outer wall is formed\nfrom a bronze bellows; its pressure is maintained by compression between\ntwo heavy metal plates. The lower, moveable, plate is held in position by a\npull-rod from room-temperature with a latching trigger mechanism on the\ncryostat top-plate.\nIn an experimental expansion, the trigger is squeezed, releasing the pull-\nrod, and allowing the lower plate to descend under the large force provided by\nthe compressed liquid. A stop (in reality, adjustable) on the top-plate limits\nExpansion of Liquid\n4\nHe Through the Lambda Transition\nroom temperature \ntrigger mechanism\na\nfixed parts\nmoving parts\ncryostat\ndisk shaped\ncompressor plates\nroom temperature\nstop\nlong, heavy rod\nfor compressing cell\nFig. 1. Schematic diagram showing the mechanism of the original [7,8]\nexpansion geometry. Note that the trigger mechanism and stop are at room\ntemperature on the cryostat top-plate, necessitating the use of a long pull-rod\nfor compressing the cell between the lower moving plate and the adjacent\n\fxed plate. The disk-shaped compressor plates (see Fig. 3(b)) were also\nrelatively heavy.\nthe movement and thus determines the \fnal pressure P\nf\nand temperature\nT\nf\n. Immediately following the expansion, a sequence of second sound pulses\nis propagated across the cell: vortices are detected by the attenuation that\nthey produce.\nThe measured evolution of the second sound amplitude\n8,9\nis shown in\nFig. 2. Rather than growing in the manner anticipated, as the expected\nvortex tangle decayed, there is no obvious change in the height of the signal at\nall, i.e. no measurable vortex creation at all. The curves show the calculated\nbehaviour for di\u000berent initial vortex line densities; under the conditions of\nthe experiment, it was expected that the initial vortex density would be\n\u0018 4\u0002 10\n12\nm\n\u00002\n, which plainly it was not.\nWe make two additional comments on these results. First, the signals\nused to construct Fig. 2 tend to be very noisy at early time, as indicated\nby the error bars. This e\u000bect seems to arise from mechanical vibrations\ncaused by the expansion process. Secondly, the densities of vortices that\nP.C.

The curves\nrefer to calculated signal evolutions for di\u000berent initial vortex line densities,\nfrom the bottom, of 10\n12\n; 10\n11\n; 10\n10\nm\n\u00002\n. The density expected on the basis\nof (1) was \u0018 4\u0002 10\n12\nm\n\u00002\n. Note the large scatter at early time.\nwere expected on the basis of the original predictions\n4,5\nwere so large that\nno special attempt was made to optimise the experiment. But, given the\nunexpectedly null result, e\u000borts in this direction are clearly needed and may\nbe expected to pay dividends.\n3. AN ENHANCED\n4\nHe EXPERIMENT\nOne way to provide a more sensitive test of the ideas underlying the\nKibble\/Zurek mechanism is to repeat the experiment under conditions where\nthe predicted initial vortex density L\ni\nis larger. Zurek's\n6\nestimate was that\nL\ni\n=\n1:2\u0002 10\n12\n(\u001c\nQ\n=100ms)\n2=3\n[m\n\u00002\n] (1)\nwhere the quench time \u001c\nQ\n, characterising how long it takes to traverse the\ntransition, is given by\nExpansion of Liquid\n4\nHe Through the Lambda Transition\n\u001c\nQ\n=\n1\n\u0010\nd\u000f\ndt\n\u0011\n\u000f=0\n(2)\nand\n\u000f =\nT\n\u0015\n\u0000 T\nT\n\u0015\n(3)\nis a parameter specifying the distance from the transition temperature T\n\u0015\n;\nnote that Zurek's more recent estimates of L\ni\n18\nare somewhat smaller than\nimplied by (1). Thus, the only way to increase L\ni\nis to reduce \u001c\nQ\nby in-\ncreasing the rate of expansion\n\u0010\nd\u000f\ndt\n\u0011\n\u000f=0\n. In principle one could consider a\nforced expansion, rather than allowing the cell to expand under its own in-\nternal pressure as at present. Given the magnitudes of the forces involved\n(equivalent to 147 Kg weight for the present cell with P\ni\n= 30 bar), and the\ndi\u000eculties already being experienced with vibration after the expansion is\nabruptly halted, this option appears di\u000ecult. A better option must be to\ntry to lighten all the moving parts so as to increase the acceleration for any\ngiven pressure.\nIn the original apparatus (Fig. 1) most of the moving mass lay in the\ntwo disk-shaped compressor plates, the long pull-rod extending up to the\ncryostat top-plate at room temperature, and in the trigger mechanism. In\na new cryostat, now being designed, we plan several radical changes to the\nexpansion mechanism, as sketched in Fig. 3. The disk-shaped plates will\nbe replaced by the \\spider-shaped\" ones shown in Fig. 3(a). The trigger\nmechanism will be lightened as much as possible consistent with having\nthe necessary strength, and placed on the top of the vacuum can \range in\nthe main liquid\n4\nHe bath (Fig. 3(b). The stop will be placed immediately\nadjacent to it, thus eliminating most of the length of the long pull-rod from\nroom temperature. A means of applying the large force (big vertical arrow)\nneeded to compress the liquid will still be needed, of course, but could be\nprovided by a chain or wire, or by a rod not bonded rigidly to the moving\nparts: it is needed only initially, to compress the liquid until the trigger\nlatches and can then be loosened. We calculate that, even without resort\nto special materials, these changes should reduce the mass of the moving\ncomponents by \u001880 %. From (1) this would imply an increase in L\ni\nby a\nfactor of \u00183.\nIt is clear from the results of Fig. 1 that it would be particularly ad-\nvantageous if the noise on the signals at early time could be reduced. It is\nbelieved to result in large part from longitudinal vibrations in the pull rod,\nwhich is in tension. These vibrations result in small changes in the length {\nand therefore the pressure and temperature { of the sample, contributing a\nP.C.

Schematic diagram showing proposed modi\fcations of the expansion\nmechanism (c.f. Fig. 1). (a) General view: trigger and stop are now in the\nmain\n4\nHe bath; a rigidly attached pull-rod is no longer needed; and the stop\nis conical. (b) The two compressor plates are now \\spider\"-shaped. The cell\nis compressed between the \fxed plate and the lower \\spider\".\nlarge noisy component to the second sound signals. Elimination of most of\nthe length of the pull rod (c.f. Figs. 1 and 3) should also, therefore, substan-\ntially reduce the e\u000bect probably also shifting it to higher frequencies where\nit will be easier to \flter out.\nA second way of reducing the shock at the end of the expansion, and\nthus the ensuing vibrations, is to replace the \rat stop with a conical one\n(Fig. 3). Most of the energy generated during the expansion will thus be\ndissipated by friction and dumped in the main liquid\n4\nHe bath. The optimal\ncone angle is yet to be determined, but it must obviously be made small\nenough to be dissimilar to the \rat stop of Fig. 1, but larger than that at\nwhich a cold weld might occur.\nExpansion of Liquid\n4\nHe Through the Lambda Transition\nIt is impossible to be quantitative about the extent to which noise at\nearly time might be reduced by these changes, but a guess of a factor of 3{4\nseems not unreasonable.\n4. CONCLUSION\nIt is concluded that, with some redesign, it should be not be too dif-\n\fcult to enhance considerably the sensitivity with which (1) can be tested,\npotentially enabling the lower bound on the disagreeement between exper-\niment and theory to be increased by an order of magnitude to \u0018 10\n3\n. Of\ncourse, if some vortex creation can be detected, it will then be necessary\nto test carefully whether it arises via the Kibble mechanism or stems from\nconventional \row processes\n7{9\ncaused by nonidealities during the expansion.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge valuable discussions or correspondence with S.N.\nFisher, A.J.
