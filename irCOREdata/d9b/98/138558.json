Introduction\nWarehouses are a key aspect of modern supply chains and play a vital role in the success, or\nfailure, of businesses today (Frazelle, 2002a). Although many companies have examined the\npossibilities of synchronised direct supply to customers, there are still many circumstances\nwhere this is not appropriate. This may be because the supplier lead times cannot be reduced\ncost effectively to the short lead times required by customers, and hence these customers need\nto be served from inventory rather than to order (Harrison and van Hoek, 2005). Similarly, it\nmay be beneficial to hold strategic inventory at decoupling points in the supply chain to\nseparate lean manufacturing activities (which benefit from a smooth flow) from the\ndownstream agile response to volatile market places (Christopher and Towill, 2001).\nAlternatively, the supply and distribution networks may be of sufficient complexity that there\nis a need for goods to be consolidated at inventory holding points so that multi-product orders\nfor customers can be delivered together i.e. at break-bulk or make-bulk consolidation centres\n(Higginson and Bookbinder, 2005). The operations of such warehouses are critical to the\nprovision of high customer service levels. A large proportion of warehouses offer a same-day\nor next-day lead-time to customers from inventory (Baker, 2004) and they need to achieve\nthis reliably within high tolerances of speed, accuracy and lack of damage.\nIn addition to these traditional inventory holding roles, warehouses have been evolving to act\nas cross-docking points (where goods are moved directly from inward to outward vehicles\nwithout being put away into inventory), value added service centres (e.g. pricing and labelling\ngoods for customers), production postponement points (configuring or assembling goods\nspecifically to customer demand so that a smaller range of generic products can be held in\ninventory), returned good centres (for reverse logistics of packaging, faulty goods or end-of-\nlife goods) and many other miscellaneous activities, such as service and repair centres (Maltz\nand DeHoratius, 2004).\nWhilst warehouses are critical to a wide range of customer service activities, they are also\nsignificant from a cost perspective. Figures for the USA indicate that the capital and\noperating costs of warehouses represent about 22% of logistics costs (Establish, 2005), whilst\nfigures for Europe give a similar figure of 25% (ELA\/AT Kearney, 2004).\n3A UK study has shown that the number of new large warehouses has steadily increased\nduring the period from 1995 to 2002 (Baker 2004). These warehouses are significant\ninvestments for companies and are often highly complex in nature. Expenditure on\nwarehouse automation has increased steadily in Europe (Frost & Sullivan, 2001) and this\ntrend is reflected globally by figures that show that sales have increased by an average of 5%\nper annum for the period 2003 to 2005 (Modern Materials Handling, 2004, 2005, 2006).\nWith this critical impact on customer service levels and logistics costs, as well as the degree\nof complexity involved, it is thus imperative to the success of businesses that warehouses are\ndesigned so that they function cost effectively. This is particularly important as warehousing\ncosts are to a large extent determined at the design phase (Rouwenhorst et al., 2000).\n2. Warehouse Design\nIn spite of the importance of warehouse design, a number of reviews of the literature have\nconcluded that relatively little has been written in academic journals on the systematic\napproach that should be taken by warehouse designers. Typical conclusions over the years\ninclude:\n\uf0b7 \u201cA search of the literature shows that very few papers deal with the general warehouse\ndesign problem\u201d (Ashayeri and Gelders, 1985, p285);\n\uf0b7 \u201cIn general, however, there is not a procedure for systematically analysing the\nrequirement and designing a warehouse to meet the operational need using the most\neconomic technology\u201d (Rowley, 2000, p3);\n\uf0b7 \u201ca sound theoretical basis for a warehouse design methodology still seems to be\nlacking\u201d (Rouwenhorst et al., 2000, p515);\n\uf0b7 \u201ca comprehensive and science-based methodology for the overall design of\nwarehousing systems does not appear to exist\u201d (Goetschalckx et al., 2002, p1).\nOn the other hand, these reviews have demonstrated that there is a wealth of material written\non analysing particular aspects of warehouse design, such as layout, order picking policies\n4and equipment choice. It is the synthesis of these techniques that appears to be lacking to act\nas a basis for the overall warehouse design (Rouwenhorst et al., 2000).\nIn the absence of a defined and accepted methodology, most warehouse designers have\ndeveloped their own approach (Oxley, 1994). In research with warehouse designers\nundertaken by Govindaraj et al. (2000), the very complex trade-offs made by the designers are\ndescribed. Terms such as \u201ceye-ball the data\u201d, and \u201cmakes some initial design\ndecisions\u2026based on intuition, experience and judgement\u201d are typical of the process\ndescribed. It therefore appears that a more formalised process would be of great assistance to\npractitioners.\n3. Approach\nThe scope for the research is the design phase from the time a specific need is identified for a\nwarehouse (for example, following a distribution strategy review) through to an operational\nspecification being produced, detailing for example, operating methods, equipment, staffing\nlevels, layout and costs. This would be up to the point where capital approval could be given\nfor the warehouse project. The subsequent steps, such as equipment tendering (if that route is\nselected), construction, installation and project management are not covered in this research.\nAn initial research of the literature was undertaken using library facilities and searching a\nrange of electronic databases, including EBSCO Business, Emerald, ProQuest, and Science\nDirect. These databases were searched using relevant keywords, such as \u201cdistribution centre\u201d,\n\u201cfacility\u201d, \u201cmaterial handling\u201d, \u201cplant\u201d, and \u201cwarehouse\u201d, combined with \u201cdesign\u201d, \u201clayout\u201d\nand \u201coperations\u201d. Relevant papers were then selected in accordance with the titles and\nabstracts. From these publications, the search was then extended by accessing the relevant\nbooks and papers that were cited.\nThe literature was then classified into two groups: those that addressed the overall steps used\nin warehouse design and those that examined particular tools and techniques. A\nchronological classification was conducted of the former to identify whether, and how, the\nsteps have developed over time. The steps proposed by the different authors were compared\nto identify whether there was common agreement and thus whether some basic warehouse\ndesign steps could be used with some confidence as an overall framework.\n5As a validation exercise to identify whether this framework reflected current practice, twelve\nwarehouse design companies were contacted by telephone or face-to-face. Details were sent\nout by e-mail for their comments and responses were received from seven of the companies.\nThese responses were used to refine the framework.\nThe companies contributing to this study ranged from large multi-national materials handling\nsystem manufacturers and integrators (namely, Jungheinrich, Savoye Logistics, and Swisslog)\nto small and medium-sized consultancies (namely, Jigsaw Logistics, LCP Consulting, LPC\nInternational, and Total Logistics). In all cases, the UK office of the company was contacted.\nThe positions of the respondents were: director (2 companies), managing director (1), head of\nwarehouse projects (1), logistics consultant (1), project engineer (1) and proposals engineer\n(1).\nAs well as requesting the steps used in the warehouse design process, the companies were\nasked which tools and techniques were normally used for each step. These tools and\ntechniques were then combined with those mentioned in publications already explored. In\naddition, further database searches were conducted on these tools and techniques so that a\nwide span of literature relevant to the subject of warehouse design was covered. The different\ntools and techniques associated with each step were then identified so as to form a structured\napproach for warehouse design, combining both literature and practitioner sources.\n4. Literature on warehouse design steps\nA number of key books and papers on overall warehouse design were identified during the\nliterature search and these are set out in chronological order in Tables 1a and 1b. They\ngenerally describe the design process in terms of a series of steps, varying from three to\nfourteen steps in number.\n[Insert Tables 1a and 1b about here]\n6Over thirty years ago, Heskett et al. (1973) described the main aspects of warehouse design\nunder three broad headings of determining the requirements, designing the material handling\nsystems, and developing the layout. The sequence of these three broad stages can be found in\nmost of the subsequent literature.\nApple (1977) observed that the designer (of facilities) faces a complex task because of the\ninteractions and relationships between each design activity, and suggested a 20-step procedure\nfor facilities design that can be adapted to the 12 steps shown in Table 1a for warehouse\ndesign. Firth et al. (1988), Hatton (1990) and Mulcahy (1994) follow a similar approach to\nthe previous authors, but also incorporate features such as the recognition of the warehouse in\nthe overall distribution network, and the comparison of alternative approaches (covering\nconcepts, equipment types and layouts).\nOxley (1994) provides a fairly comprehensive list of steps that incorporates the key features\nof the previous authors. He starts with defining the overall system requirements of the supply\nchain, including such factors as service levels and implementation time constraints. Again,\ndata collection and analysis are key steps. He also introduces a new step of establishing the\nunit loads to be used. The following steps are again concerned with developing alternative\noperating methods, equipment types and layouts. He stresses that the warehouse design\nshould be centred on the storage and handling requirements and that the building should then\nbe designed around these.\nThis basic framework of steps is also set out in Rowley (2000) and Rushton et al. (2000),\nwhere Oxley was a contributor or co-author. In the former publication, a further step is\nincluded, namely the use of computer simulation, to test the impact of different volume\nthroughputs and to identify the consequences on the rest of the supply chain. It is stressed\nthat although the steps are set out in sequence, the overall design process is iterative in nature.\nRouwenhorst et al. (2000) also state that a design process typically runs through a number of\nconsecutive phases. However, they then go on to group the activities within these steps into a\nhierarchical framework based on a top-down approach, thus identifying strategic, tactical and\noperational decisions. They propose that these three clusters of decisions should be\nconsidered in sequence.\n7Govindaraj et al. (2000) and Bodner et al. (2002) used ethnographic study techniques to\nidentify how experts actually design warehouses. They focus on the procedures that are used\nby designers and experts in the field, trying to understand the decisions they make and the\nprocesses they follow when developing a design project. They state that the designer must\nconsider some very complex trade-offs. Four to five steps are identified in these papers, plus\nthe need for reiteration of these steps. The authors state their future intention to use these\nsteps to develop computational aids for warehouse design. Govindaraj et al. (2000) propose\nan object-oriented model comprising five modules: a project module (base data); warehousing\nmodule (including unit load and equipment details); flow and control module (encompassing\nmovement within the warehouse); operation module (a specified design); and a cost module.\nThese object modules encapsulate most of the elements described by the previous authors.\nHassan (2002) and Waters (2003) again provide a series of steps which are similar in many\nways to the previous authors, although the former is primarily concerned with just one aspect\nof the design problem, namely the layout design. Waters (2003) concurs with some of the\nprevious authors in that warehouse design steps do not represent a strict sequence.\nRushton et al. (2006) have refined the steps in their earlier edition to recognise the importance\nof flexibility in warehouse design. The business requirements step includes the concept of\nscenario planning and this leads to a later specific step of evaluating design flexibility. The\niterative nature of the design process is exemplified by the equipment and staffing\ncalculations now being shown after the layout design rather than before, as with most other\nframeworks. For example, truck numbers cannot be finalised until the distances are known of\nhow far they will need to travel.\nThere are a number of common themes running through all of these methodologies to\nwarehouse design:\n\uf0a7 It is acknowledged that warehouse design is highly complex;\n\uf0a7 The authors tackle this complexity by describing step-by-step approaches;\n\uf0a7 These steps are interrelated and a degree of reiteration is necessary;\n\uf0a7 It may not be possible to identify what is the \u201coptimum\u201d solution, owing to the high\nnumber of possibilities that exist at each step.\n8There are differences in the precise steps within the various approaches described. This is\npartly caused by the way that activities are grouped together into steps and partly due to some\napproaches appearing to be more exhaustive than others. However, most of the approaches\nfollow a common pattern, as can be identified by the similar names to the steps in the rows in\nTable 1. In fact, the steps do not appear to have changed greatly over time.\n5. Steps used by warehouse design companies\nIn order to verify the general steps found in the literature, warehouse design companies were\nasked to set out the steps that they follow when they design warehouses and then to list the\ntools that they use for each step. The steps listed by Oxley (1994) were provided as a\ntemplate for the latter, for convenience or for where no formal design steps are used. The\nOxley (1994) steps were used for this purpose as they encompass the key features of the\nvarious approaches found in the literature. Three companies adopted the template as a good\nrepresentation of their steps and four provided their own steps. The steps used by the four\nlatter companies are as set out in Table 2.\n[Insert Table 2 about here]\nFor the four companies that described different steps to those provided on the template, it\nshould be noted that a similar number of steps are used (i.e. either eight or nine, compared to\neleven on the template) and these can be related reasonably closely to the template steps (i.e.\nthose of Oxley, 1994). Across the seven warehouse design companies, the steps used by\npractitioners are thus not dissimilar to those described in much of the literature. It is therefore\nproposed that the steps used for the template in this research represent a way forward for the\ndevelopment of a more comprehensive warehouse design methodology, as they are well\ngrounded in the literature and are recognisable to design practitioners.\n6. Individual tools and techniques\nThe research into the individual tools and techniques used within each of the steps was\nundertaken both from the literature and from the warehouse design companies. It was found\nthat the literature provides useful tools for some steps but does not appear to cover all of the\nsteps involved. This is supported by Rouwenhorst et al. (2000) who concluded that the\n9existing literature tends to concentrate on a small numbers of specific areas within the total\nwarehouse design problem, with areas such as conventional equipment solutions and staffing\ncalculations being largely neglected.\nThe various tools used by the warehouse design companies were set out in their responses and\nare summarised in Table 3.\n[Insert Table 3 about here]\nThe results show that warehouse designers use a variety of tools during the design process.\nThe main areas of commonality (i.e. used by more than half the respondents) were the use of:\n\uf0a7 database and spreadsheet models for data analysis;\n\uf0a7 spreadsheet models for considering equipment types;\n\uf0a7 formal spreadsheet models to calculate equipment capacities and quantities;\n\uf0a7 computer-aided design (CAD) software for drawing up the layouts;\n\uf0a7 simulation software and formal spreadsheet models for evaluation and assessment.\nBy combining the results from the literature review and the warehouse design companies, an\noverall framework can be developed, summarising the main tools used and the key references\nin the literature where these are described in more detail. This is shown in Table 4.\n[Insert Table 4 about here]\nThese tools and techniques are described below for each of the steps.\nDefine system requirements\nOxley (1994) refers here to the overall system within which the warehouse operates, and\ntherefore includes business strategy requirements and relevant constraints, such as planning\nand environmental issues. Approaches described in business and supply chain strategy\nliterature, such as on competitive advantage and consumer value (Christopher, 2005) are\nrelevant, as is the use of scenario planning (e.g. Sodhi, 2003). A framework to identify the\nrole of warehousing within supply chains is given in Baker (2007a) and there are some\n10\nchecklists on warehouse roles (e.g. cross-docking) and functions (e.g. storage) within\nwarehousing literature, for example in Higginson and Bookbinder (2005).\nDefine and obtain data\nBodner et al. (2002) state the expert designer has a pre-specified list of data to be requested, to\nwhich they may add depending on the precise nature of the project. The warehouse design\ncompanies surveyed support that checklists are often used by practitioners, normally\nformalised into database or spreadsheet models, ready for analysis. Flow charts may also be\nused to obtain information.\nSuch checklists of data are given in various publications, including Rowley (2000), McGinnis\nand Mulaik (2000), and Frazelle (2002b) and Rushton et al. (2006). These lists include\nproduct details, order profiles, goods arrival and despatch patterns, cost data and site\ninformation (where a site has already been identified).\nHatton (1990) mentions the use of specially written software by some design companies to\nextract data from company computer systems and summarise it in a useful way. After the\nextraction of historic data, Hatton (1990) goes on to explain the need to consult with various\nbusiness departments (e.g. marketing) to then develop these numbers to the required planning\nhorizon (e.g. 5 years hence).\nAnalyse data\nDatabase and spreadsheet models are normally used by practitioners to analyse data.\nGovindaraj et al. (2000) state that this process normally involves an analyst computing a\nnumber of routine statistics from the order database and then the designer uses his experience\nto interpret these statistics.\nFrazelle (2002b) presents a set of such routine statistics in a section on warehouse activity\nprofiling. These include:\n\uf0a7 Customer order profiling (e.g. pallet \/ carton \/ item mix profiles and lines per order\ndistribution);\n11\n\uf0a7 Item activity profiling (e.g. item popularity distribution and demand variability\ndistribution);\n\uf0a7 Inventory profiling (e.g. inventory distribution by Pareto group or handling unit);\n\uf0a7 Calendar-clock profiling (e.g. seasonality and daily activity distributions);\n\uf0a7 Activity relationship profiling (i.e. importance of certain functions being located nears\nother functions);\n\uf0a7 Investment profiling (e.g. wage rates and required Return On Investment).\nBenchmarking is also seen as a critical part of this process (Frazelle, 2002b), although\nHackman et al. (2001) warn of the dangers of normal ratio comparisons for comparing\nwarehouse performances. They state that a more comprehensive approach is needed that can\nconsider several dimensions of performance simultaneously and explore the use of data\nenvelopment analysis (DEA) for this purpose.\nBodner et al. (2002) describe the general use of ad hoc spreadsheet and database tools\ndeveloped during the course of previous design projects. The results of these may be brought\ntogether into comprehensive planning bases for a number of planning horizons (e.g. a 1-year\nhorizon for the initial staffing level and a 5-year horizon for the building design), as described\nby Rushton et al. (2006).\nThe respondents did not identify the use of any advanced mathematical techniques (e.g. linear\nprogramming), although some techniques may of course be contained in the spreadsheet\nmodels that are used at many stages of the design process.\nEstablish unit loads to be used\nThere are few tools listed in the literature for this step, although Roll et al. (1989) do describe\na systematic approach that develops a mathematical relationship between container size and\nstorage cost and then proceed to describe a simulation approach that can be used where\naverage values are not appropriate. Rushton et al. (2000) go on to explain that the choice of\nunit load cannot be taken in isolation but must take into account the whole supply chain (i.e.\nsupplier and customer considerations).\n12\nIt is evident from the responses that there is considerable reliance placed on the expertise of\nthe individual warehouse designers. For example, one respondent stated that unit loads were\nestablished by \u201cdesign experience and expertise, combined with iterative discussions with the\nclient\u201d.\nDetermine operating procedures and methods\nThese are the high-level procedures and methods for each function of the warehouse. A wide\nvariety of techniques are used by the respondents, including checklists, warehouse zoning,\ntechnology assessment charts, concept library, and standard work procedures.\nHatton (1990) stresses the role of the experienced designer in this process, and this is\nsupported by the ethnographic studies by Bodner et al. (2002) who describe this process as\nimplicit based on the designer\u2019s expertise.\nRouwenhorst et al. (2000) propose a framework for making these high-level decisions. They\ndetermine two clusters of problem areas at what they describe as \u201cstrategic\u201d level decisions:\ncentred around system selection on the basis of technical and economic capabilities. The first\ncluster (i.e. based on technical capabilities) relates to this step. They identify decision areas\nand state that these are highly interrelated, but found no literature to assist with these\ndecisions.\nAn important part of this step is the decision as to the zones into which the warehouse should\nbe divided (e.g. zones for different product groups, temperature regimes, or Pareto\nclassifications). Again, this appears to be left to the experience of the warehouse designer.\nBased on the adopted zones, Rushton et al. (2006) describe warehouse flow diagrams that\nrepresent the daily flows passing through the various zones of a warehouse as a basis for the\nsubsequent steps.\nGu et al. (2007) identified many papers that covered the operational design of particular\naspects of a warehouse, although some aspects have been researched far more than others.\nThe reader can refer to that paper for techniques that may be useful in determining the\noperating methods for specific activities within the warehouse. Another paper that is useful in\nthis regard is the review of warehouse models by Cormier and Gunn (1992).\n13\nFrameworks of how to incorporate flexibility into warehouse design are provided in Baker\n(2006 and 2007b). These frameworks include the consideration of which resources to adapt\nfor flexibility (e.g. buildings, equipment, staffing, processes or systems) and how to\naccommodate potential change (e.g. by extra capacity, additional resources when needed or\nthe use of flexible resources).\nConsider equipment types and characteristics\nIn contrast to some of the previous steps, there are many tools available in the literature that\nmay assist with the evaluation of equipment types. This is also reflected in the wide range of\ntechniques used by the warehouse design companies, such as decision trees, matrices, SCOR\nassessments and factor analysis.\nAshayeri and Gelders (1985) identify three generic methods that assist chiefly, although not\nsolely, with this step:\n\uf0a7 Heuristic methods (which are based on a close examination of different design\nalternatives through intuitive rules, based on experience);\n\uf0a7 Analytic methods (which are used to calculate an optimum solution);\n\uf0a7 Simulation methods (which conduct \u201cwhat if\u201d analyses).\nNaish and Baker (2004) describe a step-by-step approach to equipment evaluation,\ncomprising:\n\uf0a7 High-level technology assessment, based on such general factors as the scale of the\noperation and the flexibility required;\n\uf0a7 Equipment attributes, to identify whether each equipment type is suitable for the\napplication;\n\uf0a7 Decision trees, which act as representations of \u201cexpert systems\u201d. Examples are also\ngiven in Rowley (2000) and Rushton et al. (2006);\n\uf0a7 Full costing comparison, to calculate all the costs associated with the remaining\noptions;\n\uf0a7 Sensitivity analyses, to identify whether the preferred systems still perform well under\nalternative business scenarios;\n14\n\uf0a7 Computer simulation, to test the effectiveness of the preferred system under different\nconditions (e.g. crane breakdown).\nThis heuristic method encompasses a number of the tools described in the literature and\novercomes one of the disadvantages of analytic and simulation approaches whereby it is\ndifficult to evaluate by these means the full range of options. This narrowing down of options\nis supported by Hatton (1990), who recognises that the experience of the designer is important\nin discarding inappropriate options and thus simplifying the design task. Once the infeasible\noptions have been eliminated then analytic and simulation methods can be used to evaluate\nspecific alternatives.\nCalculate equipment capacities and quantities\nThis is generally a matter of calculation and formal spreadsheet models tend to be used, based\non warehouse flows (as per Rushton et al., 2006) and performance standards (e.g. from\nhistoric KPIs or rated activity sampling). Many of the analytic and simulation methods,\nmentioned in the previous step, in fact address equipment capacities and quantities as well as\nthe wider equipment selection question. For example, Ashayeri and Gelders (1985) list a\nnumber of papers that use a range of analytic methods, including such techniques as non-\nlinear mixed integer programming and dynamic programming, as well as simulation methods.\nThe types of question they address include the development of optimum rack lengths and\nspace utilisation, although some do examine cost minimisation between specific options.\nSimilarly, Cormier and Gunn (1992) provide a good overview of a range of warehouse\nmodels that have been developed to analyse specific aspects, such as performance evaluation\nof automated storage and retrieval systems (AS\/RS).\nDefine services and ancillary operations\nThere are no real methodologies described in the literature for this step. It appears to be\nderived from the experience of the warehouse designers, sometimes formalised into checklists\nof requirements.\nPrepare possible layouts\n15\nAll of the respondents use computer-aided design (CAD) software to assist in drawing up the\nlayouts. Canen and Williamson (1996) provide a review the literature on computer-based\nlayout packages and conclude that there is considerable software available. However, their\nresearch concluded that specialist warehouse layout software appeared to be little used by\ncompanies, who tend instead to use non-specialist software, such as AutoCAD. Such\nsoftware tends to be an aid for an experienced designer to help draw the layout, as\nexemplified by one respondent who stated that layouts are prepared \u201cby experience and use of\nAutoCAD to draft layouts\u201d.\nThis is recognised as a key step and some approaches are proposed in the literature as to how\nto formulate draft layouts. Some of these refer to plant layout tools, such as route sheets,\noperation schedules, and movable templates drawn to scale to represent freight and\nequipment, as mentioned by Heskett et al. (1973).\nMulcahy (1994) explains the complexity of the warehouse layout problem by listing ten\ndifferent objectives that need to be maximised, including for example space minimisation,\naccess to products, efficient flows, safe working environment and expansion potential. He\ngoes on to explain four methods to help design and present the layout:\n\uf0a7 Block layout;\n\uf0a7 Layout board and standard templates;\n\uf0a7 Conventional or computer-produced drawing;\n\uf0a7 Model method (e.g. a three-dimensional model, often built for presentational purposes,\nbut particularly useful to provide an insight into the relationships between different\nfloor levels of a warehouse).\nHudock (1998) demonstrates techniques for space planning of receiving \/ shipping and\nstorage areas, before proceeding to explain how experienced layout planners generate\nalternative layouts and then evaluate these. Rowley (2000) takes a high-level view,\ndescribing the four most common layouts based on the location of the receiving and shipping\ndocks that are used in warehousing operations and lists the advantages and disadvantages of\nusing them. However, he does not propose a precise methodology.\n16\nFrazelle (2002b) presents a five-step methodology for warehouse layout, which combines\nsome of the above techniques:\n\uf0a7 Space requirements planning: This involves determining the space required for each\nzone (as in the block layout technique described earlier);\n\uf0a7 Material flow planning: The determination of the overall flow pattern (e.g. U-shape or\nflow-through);\n\uf0a7 Adjacency planning: This uses a warehouse activity relationship chart, which may\nform the input for computer-aided facility layout tools.\n\uf0a7 Process location: The split of areas by low-bay and high-bay usage.\n\uf0a7 Expansion \/ contraction planning: Consideration of how the facility may be changed in\nthe future.\nThere are thus a number of techniques available to assist warehouse designers in formulating\nthe layout of a warehouse, but these are generally designed to assist an experienced\nwarehouse designer, rather than provide an optimal layout solution per se. As noted by\nCanen and Williamson (1996) there are many qualitative factors, such as safety and\naesthetics, to consider as well as the purely quantitative factors, such as the flows of goods.\nAs regards the external areas, some authors, such as Napolitano (1994) and Rowley (2000),\nmention certain criteria that designers need to bear in mind, but no specific tools are proposed.\nEvaluate and assess\nOxley (1994) states that this step is largely concerned with validating the operational and\ntechnical feasibility of the proposed solutions, checking that it meets the requirements of step\none (i.e. the initial requirements), and undertaking capital and operational cost evaluations.\nSimulation is used by most of the respondents and this technique is mentioned by several\nauthors, such as Ottjes et al. (1988), Brito (1992), Smith and Nixon (1994), Kosfeld (1998)\nand Queirolo et al. (2002). This tool can be used to analyse individual sections of the facility,\nor the facility as a whole.\nScenarios can be built, either by simulation or other modelling, to consider a series of\ndifferent situations in which the flexibility of the design can be tested. These scenarios may\n17\ninclude for example alternative growth forecasts, changes in order profiles, and abnormal\npeak requirements.\nThere are a number of simulation tools available, including general simulation packages that\ncan be adapted for warehousing, as well as specific warehousing simulation packages. Some\nof these can be bought directly from suppliers, whilst others are available through\nconsultancies, equipment suppliers and warehouse management system suppliers. However,\nit should be noted that not all of these tools are used on every occasion. For example, one\nwarehouse design company stated that: \u201cDynamic simulation is added for proof-of-concept\nfor specific projects where the client is undergoing fundamental business change. Dynamic\nsimulation is used only where database modelling will not provide accurate answers\u201d.\nIdentify the preferred design\nThis step is basically the drawing together of all of the above elements into a coherent design,\nidentifying, for example, the unit loads to be used, the operations and flows, the information\nsystems, the equipment types and quantities, the internal and external layouts, the staffing\nrequirements and the costs (Oxley, 1994). No specific process is described in the literature\nfor this step, but the warehouse design companies gave some examples of both quantitative\n(e.g. financial business case) and qualitative (e.g. SWOT analysis) methods.\n7. Discussion\nBased on the literature and the responses from the warehouse design companies, there appears\nto be some consensus on the overall approach that needs to be followed for warehouse design.\nThere can be some debate on the precise steps, as the activities in the design process can be\ngrouped together in various combinations. Similarly, there can be a further debate concerning\nthe sequence of these steps, as warehouse design tends to be an iterative, rather than a\nsequential, process. However, whilst there appears to be general consensus on the overall\nstructure of the approach, there is less consensus on the exact nature of the tools to be used for\neach step. It is evident that there is considerable reliance on the experience of individual\nwarehouse designers in deciding the tools to be used and in making judgements between\nvarious alternative solutions. A comprehensive warehouse design methodology thus appears\nto be a goal that is far from being achieved.\n18\nThere appear to be no optimisation or \u201cblack box\u201d solutions for the whole design process\nwhereby the planning base can be fed into a tool and an optimum design is produced. Also, in\nspite of the reliance on the experience of individuals, there appears to be limited use of\n\u201cexpert systems\u201d. A study by Kurokawa (2005) identified some decision tree techniques that\ncould form the basis for such systems within steps 5, 6 and 9 of the framework described\nabove but these were rather limited in nature. Based on the expert system analysis\nmethodology set out by Turban and Aronson (1998), he went on to conclude that parts of\nsteps 1, 2, 5, 6, 8 and 9 may be suitable for the further development of expert systems.\nAshayeri and Gelders (1985) identified heuristic, analytic (i.e. optimisation) and simulation\ntechniques and it appears that these all have their place. Rouwenhorst et al. (2000) grouped\nthe different decisions that need to be made into strategic, tactical and operational levels, with\nthe first two decision areas being particularly relevant to the scope of this research. Whilst the\ninterrelationship between the different decisions was stressed, no method for bringing these\ntogether was identified.\nThe findings of this paper are important to academics and practitioners. The structured\nreview of the literature summarises the warehouse design steps that have been put forward\nand the general approach that can be drawn from this has been validated with practitioners.\nThe contribution to theory is thus a structured approach to warehouse design, whilst the\ncontribution to practitioners is a validated framework, plus tools for each step, that can be\nused in practice. In addition, an agenda for research can be developed from this framework,\nas it forms a reasonably sound basis for further reflection, study and development.\n8. Further research areas\nAs identified by previous literature reviews of warehouse design, relatively little has been\nwritten about the total design process. Owing to the high cost of such facilities and the\nsignificant consequences of any deficiencies in this area (Emmett, 2005), a more\ncomprehensive and systematic methodology is needed. It is proposed that this framework can\nact as a research agenda for this area. Existing tools that address the general warehouse\ndesign problem have been brought together in this framework. These need to be integrated\nmore fully and further tools developed to address gaps, such as those identified by Kurokawa\n19\n(2005). In this way, an overall methodology can be established that builds on previous\nacademic research as well as on the current techniques used by practitioners.\nReferences\nApple, J., 1977.

Define system requirement Refer to literature on business and supply chain strategy\nliterature (e.g. Christopher, 2005) and scenario planning\n(e.g. Sodhi, 2003).\nWarehouse role framework is provided in Baker (2007a)\nand role checklist in Higginson and Bookbinder (2005).\n2. Define and obtain data Checklists and spreadsheet, or database, models are used.\nUseful checklists appear in Rowley (2000), McGinnis and\nMulaik (2000), Bodner et al. (2002), Frazelle (2002b) and\nRushton et al. (2006).\n3.
