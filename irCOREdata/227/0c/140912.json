Therefore, for the process plant, these performance specifications\nare achievable. Otherwise, they are unachievable. There is a Pareto-optimal\nset or a trade-off curve in the performance space to separate these two areas.\nThe paper shows that such trade-off curves can be used for process control-\nlability analysis, and therefore, can be applied to control structure selection\nproblems.\n1 Introduction\nThe issue of input-output controllability analysis has received increasing at-\ntention for a few decades. Input-output controllability is the ability of a\nplant to achieve acceptable control performance. Various tools and tech-\nniques have been developed and are available in the literature to quantify\nthe inherent input-output controllability of a plant (Skogestad and Postleth-\nwaite, 1996). However most of these tools are mainly open-loop controllabil-\nity indices. Each individual index only addresses one aspect of process con-\ntrollability, which causes performance limitation, such as input constraints,\nunstable poles and zeros. It is still an open area to predict performance lim-\nitation jointly imposed by these factors. Nonlinear optimisation has been\nused to predict performance limitation for a plant with input constraints\nand unstable zeros (Cao et al., 1996). The minimum input usage required\nto stabilize an unstable plant has been derived by Glover (1986) and recently\nby Havre and Skogestad (2001). A\u02dastro\u00a8m (2000) presented some results for\nperformance limitations in SISO systems. For MIMO systems, the impact\nof unstable poles and zeros on closed-loop sensitivity and complementary\nsensitivity functions has been extensively studied by Chen (2000).\n2\nIn this paper, performance limitations are presented in trade-off curves,\nwhich are used in process controllability analysis. Boyd and Barratt (1991)\nhave revealed that most control system design specifications are affine and\nconvex functions of the controller to be designed. The trade-off curves of\nthese functions have been calculated as Pareto-optimal performance set.\nAs summarised by Scherer et al. (1997), many control performance criteria\ncan be represented as a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMI)1 (Boyd et\nal., 1994). These performance criteria include H\u221e and H2 norms of certain\nclosed-loop transfer functions and pole placement regions. Using LMI, vari-\nous, even inconsistent performance requirements can be identified as feasible\nand infeasible in the performance space. These two areas are separated by\nthe Pareto-optimal performance set. The Pareto-optimal performance set\ngives a clear picture about what is the achievable performance of a pro-\ncess control system and what kind of performance trade-off is necessary for\ncontrol design.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the multiobjec-\ntive control design specifications used in this paper. Two types of Pareto-\noptimal performance curves are designated for multiobjective controllability\nanalysis. These curves are solvable by off-the-shelf software with a small\nmodification. Section 3 provides a complete case study to show the usage of\nthese Pareto diagrams in control structure selection. The paper is concluded\nin Section 4.\n1A tutorial paper on LMI for chemical process control practitioners is available else-\nwhere (VanAntwerp and Braatz, 2000).\n3\n2 Multiobjective Process Controllability and LMI\n2.1 Generalised control configuration\nControl systems can be constructed in different ways, such as: feedback,\nfeedforward, cascade, partial and indirect control. The way a control sys-\ntem constructed is referred to as control configuration. Control configuration\nhas a strong impact on the process controllability. For control structure se-\nlection purpose, it is desirable to compare process controllability of different\ncontrol configurations. Therefore, a generalised control configuration shown\nin Figure 1 is considered in the paper.\nIn Figure 1, the block P represents a general plant, whilst block K is\na controller. Signals, which link both blocks, are measured output, y and\nmanipulated input, u. The signal w represents exogenous inputs, such as\ndisturbances, references, noises and inputs from uncertainties, whilst the\nexogenous output, z, is the control objective. Assume the transfer matrix,\nP of the general plant is partitioned, according to the inputs and outputs,\nas follows:\nP =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8edPzw Pzu\nPyw Pyu\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 (1)\nThe state-space form of P is denoted as:\nP =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\nAP BPw BPu\nCPz\nCPy\nDPzw DPzu\nDPyw DPyu\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 (2)\nThe control K has the state-space form:\nK =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed AK BK\nCK DK\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 (3)\n4\nThen the closed-loop transfer function from the exogenous input, w to the\nexogenous output, z is:\nTzw = Pzw + PzuK(I \u2212 PyuK)\n\u22121Pyw =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed A B\nC D\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 (4)\nwhere the closed-loop state-space matrices are:\nA =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed AP + BPuRDKCPy BPuRCK\nBKCPy + BKDPyuRDKCPy AK + BKDPyuRCK\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 (5)\nB =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed BPw + RDKDPyw\nBKDPyw + BKDPyuRDKDPyw\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 (6)\nC =\n(\nCPz + DPzuRDKCPy DPzuRCK\n)\n(7)\nD = DPzw + DPzuRDKDPyw (8)\nwhere R = (I \u2212DKDPyu)\n\u22121.\nMost control configurations, for example those mentioned above, can\nuniformly be represented in the generalised configuration. Thus, controlla-\nbility analysis based on this generalised configuration can directly be applied\nto control structure selection.\n2.2 Performance Specification\nMany control performance specifications can be expressed as the H\u221e norm of\ncertain closed-loop transfer functions. Such functions could be the sensitivity\nfunction, S, complementary sensitivity function, T , the input sensitivity\nfunction, KS, or more generally, a closed-loop transfer function from w to\nz, i.e. \u2016Tzw\u2016\u221e. Since,\n\u2016Tzw\u2016\u221e = max\nw\n\u2016z\u20162\n\u2016w\u20162\n= max\n\u2016w\u20162=1\n\u2016z\u20162 (9)\n5\na performance specification to minimise \u2016Tzw\u2016\u221e is equivalent to minimise\nthe L2-norm of z at the worst case disturbance, w. Using the closed-\nloop state-space matrices in equation (4), an H\u221e performance condition,\n\u2016Tzw\u2016\u221e \u2264 \u03b3 (a constant) can be represented in the LMI form as follows:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\nAT P + PA PB CT\nBT P \u2212\u03b3I DT\nC D \u2212\u03b3I\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 < 0, P > 0 (10)\nIn H\u221e control design, a multiobjective performance specification is usually\ntreated as a mixed sensitivity design problem, such as mixed S-KS, or\nmixed S-T objectives with suitable weighting functions. However, for the\ncontrollability analysis purpose, the multiple H\u221e norms are better to be\nconsidered simultaneously as a multiobjective optimisation problem. The\nmultiobjective H\u221e optimisation can be solved by recently developed LMI\ntechniques (Gahinet et al., 1995).\nThe H\u221e norm is a system norm where input and output signals both\nare in L2 space. For control error, this specification is more or less similar\nto the traditional integral squared error (ISE) performance index. However,\nto consider the effect of input constraints, it is better to limit the maximal\nmagnitude of the input within its constraints. Therefore, L\u221e space is more\nappropriate than L2 in describing the control-input signal, u. If disturbance\nw \u2208 L2 and input u \u2208 L\u221e , then the induced norm from w to u is the\ngeneralised-H2 norm (Rotea, 1993; Scherer et al., 1997), denoted as \u2016Tuw\u2016g:\n\u2016Tuw\u2016g = max\nw\n\u2016u\u2016\u221e\n\u2016w\u20162\n= max\n\u2016w\u20162=1\n\u2016u\u2016\u221e (11)\nA performance specification to confine \u2016Tuw\u2016g < \u03b2 is equivalent to constrain\nthe magnitude of u less than \u03b2 at the worst case disturbance, w. The LMI\n6\nconditions for \u2016Tuw\u2016g < \u03b2 (a constant) are given by Scherer et al. (1997) as\nfollows: \uf8eb\n\uf8edA\nT P + PA PB\nBT P \u2212I\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 < 0,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8edP C\nT\nC \u03b2I\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 > 0, D = 0 (12)\nTransient response is always involved in performance requirements and\ncan often be achieved by forcing the closed-loop poles into a suitable region.\nFor example, the condition of all closed-loop poles on the left-half plane of\n<(p) \u2264 \u03b1 (a negative constant), usually called \u03b1-stability condition, will\nforce the closed-loop transient response not slower than e\u03b1t, i.e. the larger\nthe negative value of \u03b1, the faster the closed-loop transient response. A\nmore general pole region shown in Figure 2 is denoted as S(\u03b1, r, \u03b8):\nS(\u03b1, r, \u03b8) = {p | <(p) \u2264 \u03b1, |p| \u2264 r, tan(\u03b8)<(p) \u2264 \u2212|=(p)|} (13)\nIn this region, \u03b1 determines the response speed, \u03b8 specifies the minimal\ndamping coefficient of the response and r confines the controller to be well\ndefined (Chilali and Gahinet, 1996). The pole region, S(\u03b1, r, \u03b8) is equivalent\nto a set of LMI (Chilali and Gahinet, 1996),\nS(\u03b1, r, \u03b8) = R(L, M) = {p | L + pM + p\u00afMT < 0} (14)\nUsing matrices, L = {lij} and M = {mij}, the LMI conditions for the closed-\nloop matrices to satisfy the pole region are (Chilali and Gahinet, 1996):\nlijP + mijA\nT P + mjiPA < 0, P > 0 (15)\nThe multiobjective optimisation problem to be considered in the paper\nis as follows:\n\u03b3 = minK \u2016Tew\u2016\u221e\nsubject to: \u2016Tuw\u2016g < \u03b2\np \u2208 S(\u03b1, r, \u03b8)\n(16)\n7\nwhere e is the unit-feedback control error. According to (9) and (11), prob-\nlem (16) can be explained as that at worst case disturbance with \u2016w\u20162 = 1,\na controller K is to be designed to minimise the integral squared control\nerror (min \u2016e\u20162) subject to limited input magnitude (\u2016u\u2016\u221e \u2264 \u03b2) and de-\nsired transient response shape (p \u2208 S(\u03b1, r, \u03b8)). This problem is ready to\nbe solved by using off-the-shelf software, for example, the MATLAB LMI\nControl Toolbox (Gahinet et al., 1995). The MATLAB function, hinfmix\nin the LMI toolbox, originally designed for mixed H2\/H\u221e problem has been\nslightly modified for the generalised-H2 \/H\u221e problem in (16). Two multi-\nobjective Pareto diagrams, the minimum \u2016Tuw\u2016g against \u03b1-stability and the\nminimum \u2016Tuw\u2016g against the minimum \u2016Tew\u2016\u221e are to be produced by re-\npeatedly calling the modified MATLAB function. The former is to reveal\nhow large control effort is required corresponding to the response speed re-\nquired whilst the latter gives a global picture what minimal control error is\nachievable for certain limited input magnitude.\nProblem (16) presents a general control design trade-off: minimise con-\ntrol error with minimal control effort. Traditionally, such a trade-off is solved\nvia a combined objective function with properly selected weights, e.g. the\nLinear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) problem and mixed sensitivity problem.\nSeparating these two performance requirements into objective function and\nconstraint as shown in (16) is more natural and closer to a practical situa-\ntion. In addition, the LMI formulations in (10), (12) and (14) are convex.\nHence the solution of (16) is global optimal. Thus, index (16) is more suit-\nable than traditional indices such as the LQG for controllability analysis to\nreveal achievable performance limitation of a plant.\n8\n3 Case Study\n3.1 Two-CSTR Process\nThe approach for multiobjective controllability analysis is applied to a two-\nCSTR process. The process is schematically shown in Figure 3. A full\ndescription of the system and an eight-state model can be found in (Cao and\nBiss, 1996). To focus on the control structure selection problem discussed\nhere, constant volume assumption is applied to the process, which leads to a\nsix-state model to be used in the paper. The control problem is to maintain\nboth tank temperatures at desired values in the presence of cooling-water\ntemperature fluctuations within \u00b110 [K], i.e. w = [Tcw1, Tcw2]\nT . Three\npossible control configurations to be considered are:\nS1: u = [QI1, QI2]\nT , two feed flowrates and y = [To1, To2]\nT , two tank outlet\ntemperatures.\nS2: u = [Qcw1, Qcw2]\nT , two cooling-water flowrates and y is the same as S1.\nS3: u is the same as S2, but y has two extra secondary measurements,\ncooling-water outlet temperatures, i.e. y = [To1, To2, Tcwo1, Tcwo2]\nT .\nThe input constraints are\n0.05 \u2264 QI1 + QI2 \u2264 0.8 [m\n3\/s] (17)\n0.05 \u2264 Qcw1, Qcw2 \u2264 0.8 [m\n3\/s] (18)\nTo cope with the constraints, QI1 and QI2 are converted to total flowrate,\nQ and flowrate ratio, R, i.e.\nQ = QI1 + QI2 (19)\nR = QI2\/Q (20)\n9\nThe new constraints for Q and R are:\n0.05 \u2264 Q \u2264 0.8 [m3\/s] (21)\n0 \u2264 R \u2264 1 (22)\nFor variable scaling, the manipulated variables are divided by the mini-\nmum distance from their steady state value to their boundary. The distur-\nbance variables are divided by 10 [K], whilst the output variables is divided\nby 1 [K].

However, S3 has two secondary\nmeasurements, thus this index cannot be directly applied.\nOn other hand, S1 is the only configuration, which has two unstable zeros\n(10.33 and 10.31). Physically, this is because the effect of feed flowrate on\ntank temperature has two opposite directions \u2013 positive via reaction and\nnegative because the feed is colder than the liquid in the tank. Therefore,\nS2 and S3 are better than S1 in terms of unstable zeros. However, for overall\nperformance, it is difficult to judge which configuration is the best only based\non these open-loop controllability indices. Therefore, the multiobjective\ncontrollability analysis approach described above is applied to this example.\n3.3 Multiobjective Controllability Analysis\nThe multiobjective problem (16) is configured as follows for this particular\nprocess: e the control error, i.e. the difference between the two outlet tem-\nperatures, [To1, To2] and their setpoints; u the manipulated variables, i.e.\n[QI1, QI2] for S1 and [Qcw1, Qcw2] for S2 and S3 respectively; w the distur-\nbances, i.e. the cooling water inlet temperatures, [Tcw1, Tcw2]. The closed-\nloop poles region is defined as r = 20 and \u03b8 = 77.6\u25e6 (minimum closed-loop\ndamping coefficient about 0.215) with \u03b1 fixed to \u22120.5 (maximum closed-loop\ntime constant about 2 [s]) or varying. To force zero error at steady-state,\nan integrator is inserted into each error channel and will be merged into the\ncontroller designed. Based on these conditions, the multiobjective Pareto\ndiagrams are produced and shown in Figure 4.\n11\nIn order to explain the controllability behaviour presented in Figure 4,\nopen-loop poles and zeros of all configurations are listed as follows:\npoles: \u221217.8, \u221217.6, \u22120.84, \u22120.67, \u22120.13 \u22120.11\nzeros of S1: 10.33, 10.31, \u22120.8, \u22120.62\nzeros of S2: \u221218.01, \u221217.98\nzeros of S3: none\nComparing open-loop poles with Figure 4 (a) shows that input magnitude\nrequired for \u03b1-stability is depend on the location of the open-loop poles,\nwhich are on the right of the \u03b1-line. The longer the distance of these poles\nto the \u03b1-line, the larger the input magnitude required. However, the input\nmagnitude required is also dependent on the controllability of these poles.\nTo move a less controllable pole requires larger control effort. For S1, the\nopen-loop zeros of \u22120.8 and \u22120.62 is very close to open-loop poles, \u22120.84\nand \u22120.67. Therefore, these two poles have less controllability in S1 than\nthe same poles in other configurations. This causes the sharp increase of\ninput magnitude required (\u2016Tuw\u2016g) of S1 when \u2212\u03b1 > 0.6 (see Figure 4 (a)\nfrom \u03b1 = \u22120.6 towards left).\nThe results also show that the achievable performance of S1 in terms\nof \u2016Tew\u2016\u221e has a low bound about 0.003 (vertical part of the solid-line\nin Figure 4 (b)). The lower bound is due to its unstable zeros, thus is\nindependent of input constraints.\nHowever, S1 is still the best configuration when \u2212\u03b1 < 0.6 and \u2016u\u2016\u221e < 1\n(i.e. \u2016Tuw\u2016g < 1 in the figures). It is also shown that the nonsquare config-\nuration, S3 does improve the controllability by introducing extra measure-\nments into configuration S2. It can achieve almost the same performance as\nS1 within the input constraints (Figure 4 (b) at \u2016Tuw\u2016g = 1) . If the input\n12\nconstraints were permitted to increase slightly, S3 would even be better than\nS1. This observation is verified by the simulation results (see Figures 5).\n3.4 Nonlinear Simulation\nTo verify the results obtained in multiobjective controllability analysis, a\nsimulation has been carried out on the original nonlinear model (Cao and\nBiss, 1996). The controllers K1, K2 and K3 given in equations (29), (30) and\n(31) are designed for control configurations S1, S2 and S3 respectively. These\ncontrollers are calculated to achieve performance specification of \u2016Tew\u2016\u221e to\nthe level corresponding to \u2016Tuw\u2016g = 1 in Figure 4(b). The actual maxi-\nmal input magnitudes observed in the simulation match the \u2016Tuw\u2016g values\npredicted in Figure 4(b) (see Figure 6).\nK1 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed AK1 BK1\nCK1 DK1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 (29)\n=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u22123.87 32.82 \u22127.04 1.26 0.88 \u22120.45 \u221232.88 2.62 0 0\n\u221233.08 \u221211.05 0.31 5.43 \u22121.77 0.24 \u221245.92 \u22124.12 0 0\n6.33 1.77 \u22127.12 26.06 \u22120.28 \u22121.71 7.23 \u221233.08 0 0\n\u22120.68 \u22125.57 \u221225.98 \u221214.60 1.14 2.54 \u22124.06 \u221233.47 0 0\n\u22120.94 \u22121.48 1.13 0.97 \u22120.90 \u22120.02 \u22123.62 1.88 0 0\n0.34 0.91 1.41 2.59 \u22120.04 \u22120.94 1.64 3.39 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n\u221215.81 15.41 \u221218.02 14.26 0.93 \u22122.07 \u221246.17 \u221235.40 0 0\n8.63 \u221216.65 \u22126.80 10.41 \u22121.64 \u22120.67 27.67 \u221231.41 0 0\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n13\nK2 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed AK2 BK2\nCK2 DK2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 (30)\n=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u22120.32 \u221219.71 0.05 0.02 1.12 \u22120.01 \u221219.43 0.17 0 0\n19.70 \u221210.39 0.19 0.05 5.75 \u22120.08 100.71 3.60 0 0\n\u22120.05 \u22120.00 \u22120.52 11.78 \u22120.21 \u22121.59 \u22120.84 13.83 0 0\n\u22120.09 0.05 \u221211.79 \u221210.06 0.18 6.40 \u22122.12 50.06 0 0\n\u22121.12 5.75 0.03 \u22120.02 \u22128.98 0.04 \u221230.90 \u22121.44 0 0\n0.03 \u22120.01 1.60 6.40 \u22120.09 \u22128.11 0.76 \u221218.69 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n6.79 35.24 \u22120.11 \u22120.87 \u221210.81 0.42 34.60 \u22120.22 0 0\n0.21 0.96 \u22123.08 11.11 \u22120.44 \u22124.14 0.37 17.86 0 0\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\nK3 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed AK3 BK3\nCK3 DK3\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 (31)\n=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u22125.15 \u22120.56 \u22123.42 \u22120.33 \u22127.19 0 0 0.11 \u22120.65\n\u22120.64 \u22120.61 \u22120.46 1.88 \u22120.89 0 0 \u22121.04 \u22120.13\n\u22122.84 \u22120.43 \u22122.76 0.14 \u22122.91 0 0 0.03 0.98\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0.13 \u22120.75 \u22120.00 20.89 0.24 0 0 0 0\n\u22121.60 \u22120.20 \u22120.68 0.01 13.17 0 0 0 0\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\nThe simulation results are shown in Figures 5 and 6. The figures clearly\nindicate that the predictions made from multiobjective controllability analy-\nsis are correct: S1 is the best configuration in terms of control accuracy and\nresponse speed. By introducing secondary measurements, S3 can achieve\nalmost the same performance as S1. Due to the nonlinearity of the process,\nin the case of negative disturbance, S3 is even better than S1. Comparing\ninput response of S2 and S3 in Figure 6, it is shown that the control ef-\nfort required for disturbance rejection is slightly reduced by using secondary\nmeasurements (Figure 6).\n14\n4 Conclusions\nThe proposed approach for multiobjective controllability analysis is able to\nidentify performance limitation imposed by multi-factors, such as unsta-\nble zeros and input constraints. It is also suitable for more sophisticated\nconfigurations, such as nonsquare, cascade and two degrees-of-freedom con-\ntrol. The produced Pareto diagrams can be directly used for control design\ntrade-off. The generalised-H2 norm is better than H\u221e norm to describe\ninput with input constraints. The enforced closed-loop pole region makes\nthe closed-loop time response more predictable.\nReferences\nA\u02dastro\u00a8m, K. J. (2000). Limitations on control system performance.
