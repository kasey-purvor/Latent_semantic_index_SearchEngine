The alginate beads were compared to cur-\nrent embolisation microspheres for compressibility and\nmonitored over 12 weeks for size and weight change at\n37\u0003C in low volumes of ringers solutions. A sheep uterine\nmodel was used to analyse bead degradation and inflam-\nmatory response over 12 weeks. Both the in vitro and in\nvivo data show good delivery, with a compressibility\nsimilar to current embolic beads. In vitro, swelling was\nnoted almost immediately and after 12 weeks the first signs\nof degradation were noted. No difference was noted in\nvivo. This study has shown that high molecular weight\nalginate gel beads were well tolerated by the body, but\nbeads associated with induced thrombi were susceptible to\ninflammatory cell infiltration. The beads were shown to be\neasy to handle and were still observable after 3 months in\nvivo. The beads were robust enough to be delivered\nthrough a 2.7 Fr microcatheter. This study has demon-\nstrated that high molecular weight, high purity alginate\nbead can be considered as semi-permanent embolisation\nbeads, with the potential to bioresorb over time.\n1 Introduction\nPolysaccharides, such as alginates, are widely used in food,\ncosmetic and medical fields due to their structural proper-\nties, biocompatibility and safety. When alginate is com-\nbined with divalent cations a hydrogel is formed that\nexhibits a level of biocompatibility that can encapsulate\ncells [1]. Previous studies have shown that purity can affect\nthe biocompatibility of alginate implants [2]. Alginate is a\ncopolymer composed of mannuronate (M) and guluronate\n(G) stereomonomers [3, 4]. The affinity of a divalent cation\n(i.e. calcium) is stronger for G isomers due to the steric\narrangement of the atoms [4, 5]. Two G monomers form an\n\u2018\u2018egg-box\u2019\u2019 in which a calcium ion sits and crosslinks two\npolymer chains [4]. Consequently the M:G ratio will effect\nthe crosslinking capacity and thus the physical properties\nof a calcium alginate gel [6].\nAlginate is also a biodegradable polymer; the backbone\ncan be degraded via hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds [7]\nor an alginate gel can dissolve due to the elution of the\ncross-linking calcium cation [6]. Molecular weight has\nbeen shown to affect alginate polymer chain degradation\n[8] and the elution of the crosslinking calcium can also lead\nto dissolution of gel [9]. This paper considers both high M\nand high G calcium crosslinked alginate gel beads as\ndevices for use in embolisation.\nTherapeutic embolisation is the intentional introduction\nof a (foreign) embolic material into a blood vessel in order\nto reduce or completely obstruct the blood flow.

The\nchoice of embolic agent depends on the desired level of\nocclusion down the vascular tree and permanency. The\nideal occlusion technique is one that allows for accurate\nguidance and delivery to the target with low risk of injury\nto normal structures. To achieve this, interventional radi-\nologists (IRs) are of the opinion that the embolic agent\nrequires a combination of a number of attributes [10]. In\nhandling the agent, it must be either radiopaque or have the\nability to be mixed into a radiopaque suspension to enable\nvisualisation during delivery. Simplicity and reliability of\ndelivery is preferred (glue is notoriously difficult to handle\nfor instance), without blocking of the catheters used to\ndeliver the agents. Adaptability to allow selective and rapid\nocclusion of various blood vessels sizes and types is\ndesirable; and an ability to reach distal vascular beds is\nparticularly important in the treatment of tumours. If pos-\nsible, the agent should have amenability to trouble shoot-\ning\/salvage in case of complications or device malfunction.\nOther important considerations include biocompatibility\nand cost competitiveness.\nOne important and growing area of embolotherapy is\nuterine artery embolisation (UAE), or sometimes referred\nto as uterine fibroid embolisation (UFE). Since its fist\nreport in 1995 [11] it is estimated that more that 100,000\nUAE procedures have been performed (mainly in the\nUSA and Europe) [12]. Outcomes from a large US reg-\nistry [13] and four separate (albeit relatively small) ran-\ndomised trials over the last few years [14\u201317]\ndemonstrate that UAE is safe and effective, gives similar\nresults to hysterectomy but with faster and shorter\nrecovery and uterine preservation. This is balanced\nagainst the need to retreat some patients following UAE.\nGiven that some patients opt for UAE as they wish to\nmaintain the potential for future pregnancy, there is some\ndebate over whether the embolisation agent should be\npermanent or temporary in nature. Gelatin sponge (or\nGelfoam\u0004) provides the only current degradable option,\nwhich is non-calibrated, has an irreproducible degradation\nrate and can induce a strong inflammatory response. A\ncalibrated microspherical embolisation agent with con-\ntrolled degradability could therefore fulfil a role in the\nclinical practice of UAE.\nThis paper reports the results from some in vitro and in\nvivo models used to assess all the key necessary attributes\nof alginate beads as an embolisation device. The in vitro\ntests examined bead compressibility compared to other\nembolic beads on the market, microcatheter deliverability\nand bead degradation. A sheep uterine artery embolisation\nmodel, designed to mimic UAE conditions, was used to\nassess bead deliverability, biocompatibility and degrada-\ntion over 12 weeks in vivo.\n2 Experimental\n2.1 Materials\nDry kelp is used for the production of Phycomer (CellMed\nAG, Alzenau, Germany), a highly purified sodium alginate\nwith a markedly low impurity profile, made by a proprie-\ntary patented purification process [18]. Phycomer E01, a\nhigh M alginate with a mannuronic acid content about\n59%, is isolated from the brown algae species Laminaria\npallida. It has a molecular weight of greater than\n800,000 g\/mol with a typical viscosity of a 0.2% w\/v\nsolution being 10\u201360 mPa.s. Phycomer E01 has properties\nideally suited for the production of soft, biodegradable non-\npermanent implants.\nPhycomer C01, which is isolated from Laminaria hy-\nperborea, is a high G alginate with a guluronic acid content\nabout 68% and a molecular weight of around 400,000 g\/\nmol, producing a 0.2% w\/v solution viscosity of 5\u2013\n13 mPa.s. Phycomer C01 forms stiffer gels with tighter\npores than Phycomer E01 and is used for the immunoiso-\nlation of cellular implants, such as GLP-1 producing\nCellBeads which are under clinical evaluation for the\ntreatment of haemorrhagic stroke [19] and pre-clinical\nevaluation for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction\n[20].\nThe beads used in the compressibility comparison tests\nwere 900\u20131200 lm Bead BlockTM; (Biocompatibles UK\nLtd, UK), 900\u20131200 lm DC BeadTM; (Biocompatibles UK\nLtd, UK), 900\u20131200 lm Embosphere\u0004 (Biosphere Medical\nInc., USA) and Countour SETM (Boston Scientific Inc.\nUSA).\n2.2 Methods\n2.2.1 Bead preparation\nThe beads were prepared by dissolving high molecular\nweight sodium alginate at a concentration of 0.6% (w\/v) in\nsaline. Using a droplet generator similar to that described\nelsewhere [21], a stream of the alginate solution was\ninjected through a needle bore using a motorized syringe\nand cut using a jet of hydrated compressed air, forming\nsmall alginate solution droplets. The solution droplets were\ncrosslinked in a 100 mM calcium chloride solution placed\nunderneath the syringe. Bead diameter could be controlled\nby varying key parameters such as the solution injection\nrate, airflow and needle size. The mean diameters (\u00b1SD) of\nthe beads used in most experiments were 506 lm\n(\u00b118 lm) and 506 lm (\u00b121 lm) in Ringers solution for\nhigh G and high M beads respectively. Larger beads made\nusing the same procedure were generated for compression\ntesting. All beads were produced under aseptic conditions\n2244 J Mater Sci: Mater Med (2010) 21:2243\u20132251\n123\nto maintain sterility, as conventional sterilisation methods\nsuch as irradiation cause degradation of the alginate and\naffect its ability to gel [22].\n2.2.2 Compression testing\nThe required force necessary to compress the alginate\nbeads was assessed using a flat 5 mm cylindrical probe\nattached to an Instron Materials Testing Systems Model\n4411 (Instron High Wycombe, UK) mounted with a 50 N\nload cell. A close packed monolayer of beads (900\u2013\n1100 lm) in Ringers solution was placed on a flat surface\nunderneath the probe. Excess Ringers solution was wicked\nfrom the sample using a tissue. The probe was positioned\n1.2 mm above the plate. The probe was then extended by\n0.85 mm at a speed of 5 mm\/min and the load data was\nrecorded. The modulus was calculated from the initial\ncompression gradient of a stress\/strain plot of the com-\npression force. Since the resistivity of a hydrogel to com-\npression is sensitive to conditions such as humidity and\ntemperature all beads were tested within 2 h of each other\nto minimise these effects. Commercially available embolic\nmicrospheres were tested for comparison. The embolic\nbeads tested were High G alginate, High M alginate, DC\nBead, BeadBlock, Contour SE and Embosphere.\n2.2.3 Deliverability (in vitro)\nIn order to assess simplicity of delivery technique and\nreliability of the delivery mechanism, each of the bead\nformulations were delivered down a Progreat 2.7 Fr cath-\neter (Teumo, Japan) three times. Alginate gel beads were\nsuspended at a 1\/10 dilution in a 50:50 mix of saline (0.9%)\nand contrast medium (Omnipaque, GE Healthcare, USA).\nEach solution was placed on a roller mixer for 3\u20135 min.\nHalf of the sample volume was drawn into a reservoir luer\nlock syringe; this was connected to a three way connector\nand thoroughly mixed with an attached 3 ml delivery syr-\ninge. Post mixing, the product was drawn and delivered\nfrom the 3 ml syringe. Once delivered a further two 3 ml\naliquots were drawn, mixed and delivered.\nThe delivery was scored using a 0\u20135 scoring system (0\nindicating a saline like delivery and 5 indicating a complete\nblockage). The catheter was then flushed with saline and\nthe process was repeated with the second half of the bead\/\nsolution mix. Post delivery the beads were assessed for\nbead fragmentation using an Olympus phase contrast\nmicroscope.\n2.2.4 Degradation (in vitro)\nAlginate gel bead degradation analysis was monitored in\nvitro by measuring the elution of calcium from the beads\nusing ion chromatography (IC) and size\/weight change of\nthe hydrated beads using an Olympus phase contrast\nmicroscope. To mimic the minimal fluid embolic bead\nwould be exposed to in an embolic environment in vivo,\nonly 1 ml Ringers solution was placed in a centrifuge tube\nwith 0.5 ml alginate beads measured into centrifuge inserts\nwith 5 lm pores (Ultrafree-MC PVDF durapore; Millipore,\nUK). The samples were placed in an oven at 37\u0003C until a\ntesting time point, when the samples were centrifuged\n(JOUAN CR312, Paris, France) at 300G for 5 min. The\nsolution collected after centrifuging was kept for IC anal-\nysis. The remaining hydrated spheres were weighed using a\nmicrobalance and 1 ml Ringers solution was added.\n2.2.5 Sheep uterine arterial embolisation model\n2.2.5.1 Species The five animals used in this study were\nnon-pregnant female sheep aged between 2 and 5 years.\nThe breed was Blanche du Massif Central. The sheep each\nweighed between 40 and 60 kg at the beginning of the\nstudy.\n2.2.5.2 Ethics The study was conducted at Biomatech\nSAS, France and was approved by Biomatech Ethical\nCommittee prior to implementation. The animals were kept\nin conditions which conformed to the requirements of farm\nanimals under ECC directive 86\/906.\n2.2.5.3 Procedure In order to obtain an arterial size in\nsheep similar to that of a woman with uterine fibroids,\nhormonal control was required [23]. The menstrual cycle of\nthe sheep was controlled by inserting a sponge impregnated\nwith 40 mg Chronolone (Chrono-gest\u0004 Esponge; Intervet,\nFrance) inside the vagina of the animal. After 13 days the\nsponge was removed, and an intramuscular injection of\n500 IU of serum derived gonadotropin (Chrono-gest\u0004\nPMSG; Intervet, France) was administered to achieve\novulation. Pelvic angiography and embolisation of the\nuterine arteries was then performed within 24 h of the\ninjection. The animals were fasted 24 h prior to the\nprocedure.\nEmbolisation beads (1 ml) were supplied sterile in vials\nand were mixed with contrast agent prior to embolisation.\nThe beads were suspended at a dilution of 1\/10 in a 50:50\nmixture of contrast agent and saline in a final volume of\n10 ml and gently shaken to homogenize the suspension.\nThis was then split into two 5 ml syringes, one for each\nfeeding artery. A total of 0.5 ml of beads in a 5 ml sus-\npension was used for the embolisation of each uterine\nartery (this is equivalent to approximately 5000 beads).\nThis volume was selected in order to induce minimal\nnecrosis of the organ and hence allow a proper assessment\nof the inflammatory response to the beads. The injection\nJ Mater Sci: Mater Med (2010) 21:2243\u20132251 2245\n123\nwas performed slowly under fluoroscopic control. After\ninjection of embolic agent, the catheter was purged with\napproximately 3 ml of saline. The surgery was performed\nunder angiography (Philips BV212). The study did not\nfully embolise the uterus as this may have impeded\nassessment of the other factors or caused premature death,\nby inducing too much tissue necrosis.\nOne feeding artery was used per test article as shown in\nTable 1. Animals were killed at 1 week (n = 1, 1 feeding\nartery per test article), 4 weeks (n = 2, 2 feeding arteries\nper test article) or 12 weeks (n = 2, 2 feeding arteries per\ntest article) after embolisation by lethal injection of bar-\nbiturate (Dolethal\u0004, VETOQUINOL, France).\nThe uterus, ovaries and local lymph nodes were sampled\nto allow for the gross and histological examination of the\ncervix, body and horn.\n2.2.5.4 Deliverability (in vivo) Assessments were made\nat the time of the embolisation procedure: ease of appli-\ncation and handling, reflux or adverse effects at the time of\nembolisation, duration of embolisation and bead volume\ninjected.\n2.2.6 In vivo analysis procedures\n2.2.6.1 Histological analysis For each level (of the cer-\nvix, body and horn segment) one slice was fixed in 10%\nbuffered formalin and the second slice was fixed in Car-\nnoys fixative. Carnoys fixative consists of 60% ethanol,\n30% chloroform and 10% gluteraldehyde and was used\nbecause formalin has been reported to dissolve alginate\ngels [24]. Formalin was still also used as higher sample\nresolution can be obtained. The tissues were then processed\nby means of paraffin embedding. Safranin-hematoxylin-\neosin staining was performed. Where beads were found in\nthe histological sections the samples were analysed for\nsigns of inflammation and necrosis.\n2.2.6.2 Degradation and distribution Using the histo-\nlogical slides, the beads were noted for signs of degradation\nin relation to the length of time that they had been in the\nanimals. Possible signs of degradation or resorption were\ndetermined as including (i) the presence of cellular infil-\ntration in the bead surface, (ii) the presence of alginate\nmaterial within the cytoplasm of giant cells and macro-\nphages, (iii) the surface roughness of the bead.\n3 Results and discussion\n3.1 Compressibility\nFigure 1 shows the comparative moduli (kPa) required to\ncompress various beads. The trend observed is the same as\nthat seen by other compression tests in the literature [25].\nThere is no statistical significance (P [ 0.05; Bonferonni\ncorrected Student\u2019s t-test) between High M and High G\nalginate beads. Alginate beads are most similar in com-\npressibility to Bead Block (Bonferroni corrected Student\u2019s\nt-test, P [ 0.05 (G); P [ 0.05 (M)).\n3.2 Deliverability\nThe compressibility analysis of the alginate beads indicated\nthat the delivery should be similar to beads already on the\nmarket. However whilst the compressibility was similar,\nthe compressibility method does not establish the robust-\nness, fragmentation potential or elastic recovery speed of\nthe beads. In order to establish these properties, it was\nnecessary to test the beads in a clinically relevant scenario.\nThis was achieved by forcing the beads through a 2.7 Fr\nProgreat microcatheter that is commonly used in emboli-\nsation procedures. Images of the alginate beads post\ndelivery can be seen in Fig. 2.\nThe in vitro delivery of the alginate beads in omnipaque\ncontrast media, offered some resistance with an average\nscore of 2.5 when being delivered through the catheter.\nWhen beads had already been delivered in the catheter\nlumen and the catheter was not flushed with saline, slightly\nhigher resistance was felt during the next bead injection;\nwith a delivery score of 2. No fragmentation was noted for\nboth high M and high G beads.\nThe delivery of the beads in the sheep uterine artery\nembolisation model was quite similar for the two arteries to\nbe embolised respectively; 9.8 s \u00b1 3.0 (SD) for the left and\n10.2 s \u00b1 3.9 (SD) for the right artery showing consistency.\nThe mean score calculation for those parameters per type\nof bead did not show marked difference (Table 2). All\nradiologists graded both bead types as good with regards to\ntheir ease of handling and application This was consistent\nwith the in vitro assessment. In addition the embolisation\ntimes were very similar for all injections (&10 s); another\ndemonstration of facile delivery. Further analysis of the\ndata showed that any variation in the duration of injection\nwas attributable to the surgeon that performed the injection\non the day rather than to the beads themselves (Student\u2019s t-\ntest, P \\ 0.05). Moreover, regardless of the interventional\nTable 1 Table showing the number of uterine feeding arteries (n)\nused in each test group and the corresponding beads that were injected\nBead type Duration of live exposure to alginate gel bead\n1 week 4 weeks 12 weeks\nHigh G n = 1 n = 2 n = 2\nHigh M n = 1 n = 2 n = 2\n2246 J Mater Sci: Mater Med (2010) 21:2243\u20132251\n123\nradiologist used, had there been a blockage the time taken\nto inject the beads would have increased noticeably com-\npared to the average for that user. No catheter blockages\noccurred during any of the procedures.\n3.3 Bead degradation\n3.3.1 In vitro: size, shape and weight change\nThe weight change of the centrifuged hydrated beads\n(Fig. 3a) followed a similar profile to as the size difference\n(Fig. 3b). Both showed an increase during the first week in\nRingers solution and then began to decrease after 4 weeks.\nHigh M beads showed greater size and weight increase\nthan high G.\n3.3.2 In vivo: gross examination\nAt first week a slight reddening of the uterus was observed\nand attributed to embolisation induced necrosis. Clear\nmacroscopic signs of necrosis or inflammatory reaction\ncould not be observed in the gross specimens for the 4 and\n12 week time period.

The bead was found either completely occluding an\nartery or within an artery surrounded by white space. The\nwhite space is likely to be due to the bead dehydrating\nduring the processing step [26]. The third environment\nwhere the presence of beads was detected was the obser-\nvation of a circular space left behind within an artery. The\npresence of a bead was shown by the compression of the\nintima and media arterial layers; non-embolised arteries of\na similar size have thicker walls and non-circular elastic\nlumen. In some instances the presence of a bead was\napparent through the observation of a circular gap in the\nthrombus within an artery. The beads were sometimes\nobserved in a combination of these situations and were not\nalways observed as single beads. On occasion a longitu-\ndinal cut of an artery would reveal a line of beads or a\ncluster of beads could be detected in a larger artery.\nThe alginate beads within the arterial lumen are not nec-\nessarily spherical because the slice cannot always be taken\nperpendicular to the artery. Beads may seem elongated or\nmisshapen if the section had been taken at a non-\nperpendicular angle. In addition odd shapes may be observed\nif the slice was taken at an arterial junction. Also, the pro-\ncessing of the tissue and thin histology sections mean that the\nlikelihood of observing a bead is small and consequently\nonly few beads were observed in all of the sections. It is\nworth noting that the lack of any beads does not necessarily\nmean that any were lost through degradation.\nThe extent of necrosis and inflammation observed for\nthe samples was assessed and scored on a simple three-\ngrade scale (grade 0 = absent, grade 1 = moderate (\\50%\nof the observed area), grade 2 = extensive ([50% of the\nobserved area). At first week, the mean necrosis score was\nonly 0.46 \u00b1 0.71, indicating less than moderate necrosis;\nthis is to be expected given the small amount of embolic\nused was regulated to limit the degree of necrosis occur-\nring. Necrosis was indicated by light-pink staining under\nH&E of a largely acellular nature with lack of visible\nnuclei, mostly associated with sections containing multiple\nbeads where the embolic effect would be more severe\n(Fig. 4, black arrows). There was no evidence of necrosis\nat either the 4 week or 12 week time points, as the tissue\nhas remodelled. Inflammation was similarly only very mild\n(average score over all samples 0.25 \u00b1 0.43) and again,\nonly observed at the 1 week time period.\nAt all time points alginate beads were observed within\narteries post mortem. Cellular infiltration and surface\nroughness were infrequent but were observed at all time\npoints, for both bead types (Fig. 5). This demonstrated that\nthis method of degradation was not time nor bead specific.\nGenerally, if cellular infiltration did occur, the site was\noften located near signs of thrombus, which is likely to\nhave been induced by embolisation. In addition, at all time\npoints, round smooth beads were found in the lumen of\narteries without signs of thrombus, inflammatory cells or\ndegradation (Fig. 5). This suggests that the beads were not\n400\n450\n500\n550\n600\n650\n0 1 2 3 8 28 84\nTime \/ days\nM\nic\nro\nsp\nhe\nre\n d\nia\nm\net\ner\n \/ \n\u00b5m High GHigh M\nStarting size \nHigh G\nHigh M\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\n120%\n140%\n160%\n0 1 2 3 8 28 84\nTime \/ days\nM\nic\nro\nsp\nhe\nre\n h\nyd\nra\nte\nd \nw\nei\ngh\nt (\n% \nof\n \no\nrig\nin\nal\n w\nei\ngh\nt)\nHigh G\nHigh M\nFig. 3 Change in M and G alginate gel beads a diameter (mean,\n\u00b1SD, (n = 100)) and b hydrated weight (% original weight, \u00b1max\/\nmin, (n = 3)), in 1 ml Ringer\u2019s solution at 37\u0003C for 12 weeks. The\nRinger\u2019s solution was removed and replaced at each time point.\nInitially, the size increased over the first few days, but decreased back\nto the original size after 4 weeks and then dropped below the original\nsize after 12 weeks\nFig. 4 Example of multiple beads (high G alginate) at 1 week, with\nsome areas of associated necrosis (arrows) surrounding the vessels\n2248 J Mater Sci: Mater Med (2010) 21:2243\u20132251\n123\ndegrading simply due to their presence within the arterial\nsystem. Some evidence of further degradation by extensive\ncellular infiltration was observed at some, but not all, time\npoints. Some examples are given in (Fig. 6). None of the\nalginate beads however, were fully degraded within\n12 weeks.\nThe level of bead degradation 1, 4 and 12 weeks post-\nimplantation in vivo did not follow any trends with respect\nto time (Fig. 5). In addition, degradation could not be\nmonitored by size as the sectioning was effectively random\nso beads could not be shown to have been sliced at the\nlargest diameter, thereby making any comparison void. The\nsample number was too low to overcome this.\n4 Discussion\nIn embolic procedures the ease of delivery of the embolic is\nimperative, unwanted catheter blockage adds time and\npressure to the process; limiting the control the interven-\ntional radiologist has. The high purity, high molecular\nweight alginate gel beads (both high G and high M)\nshowed good deliverability in vitro, and in vivo. The lack\nof fragmentation will prevent any unwanted premature\nembolisation due to particulates clumping together. The\ndata obtained from compression testing shows that neither\na higher G or M content has any significant effect on the\ncompressibility of the alginate gel beads; the in vivo data\nalso showed no obvious difference between the two bead\ntypes. The in vitro compressibility of the calcium cross-\nlinked high molecular weight alginate beads was most\nsimilar to Bead Block, an embolic bead that is currently\nused for UFE [25, 27].\nThe main physical difference between the in vitro setup\nand the reality in vivo is the extent to which 1 ml repre-\nsented the sink conditions in an embolisation capacity; this\nis yet to be fully determined.\nIn vivo, inflammatory cell infiltration and bead surface\nroughness appeared to be often thrombus-associated,\nwhereas the beads with smooth surfaces appeared to lack\nthis association. This suggests that whilst an alginate bead\ncan undergo degradation, this may be accelerated by the\ninfiltration of surrounding thrombus by inflammatory cells.\nSome beads will be exposed to more thrombus than others\nas a consequence of their relative position within the em-\nbolised vessel; those more proximal or distal in the column\nof occluding beads for instance. This accounts for the inter-\nbead variability observed. The reorganisation of tissue and\nbead degradation makes the system dynamic and in time\nallows previously unexposed beads to become eventual\ntargets for inflammatory cells. Consequently, both pristine\nand misshapen beads can be seen at all time points. When\ncompared to studies of a range of other embolic agents on\nthe impact on inflammatory tissue and foreign body reac-\ntion in porcine liver [28] or kidney [29] models, our find-\nings here were consistent with a low level inflammatory\nreaction in the uterine arteries. The excellent overall tol-\nerance of the alginate beads in vivo is an expected conse-\nquence of the ultra-high purity alginate used to synthesise\nthe beads. These observations could be important when\nconsidering new materials suitable for use in biodegradable\nembolic devices.\nHigh G High M \n1 \nw\nee\nk\n4 \nw\nee\nk\n12\n w\nee\nks\n \nFig. 5 Images of high G and\nhigh M alginate beads after 1, 4\nand 12 weeks in an\nembolisation environment.\nExamples of smooth and rough-\nedged beads can be observed for\nboth types at all time points\nJ Mater Sci: Mater Med (2010) 21:2243\u20132251 2249\n123\nIn vitro degradation began to be observed after\n12 weeks under pseudo embolisation conditions. Lang [30]\ncomposed a table of the occlusion times and potential to\nrestore the blood vessel for embolic materials used in\ntranscatheter embolisation. Although this table illustrates\ndata for the occlusion of arteries of different sizes, it is\nclear that 12 weeks degradation is long enough to maintain\nthe occlusion, but is probably too late to enable restoration\nof vascular continuity within that blood vessel. In vivo\nhowever, no significant difference was noted between the\nG or M beads with regards to size and neither showed signs\nof degradation after 1, 4 and 12 weeks. The discrepancy\nmay be due to the biological environment to which an\nembolised microsphere is exposed.\nCompared to the 2\u20133 week degradation time of Gelfoam,\nthe in vitro degradation of 4\u201312 weeks may mean that these\nalginate beads may be too permanent to restore vascular\nconnection. However, patients commonly express worries\nabout foreign materials remaining in the body in uterine\nfibroid embolisation [31] and whilst this may or may not be\na physiological problem, reduction of additional angst for\nthe patient is desirable. An embolic, made from what could\nbe considered a natural material, which can perform its\nfunction and then be degraded and excreted from the body\nover time, could be attractive to the patient. The alginate\nbeads tested here could offer this potential. The study pre-\nsented here however, aimed to evaluate tissue reaction to\nthe alginate material and its degradation potential. Although\nthe mechanical properties of the alginate beads would\nsuggest that they have equivalent deformation properties to\nother commercially available embolisation microspheres,\nfurther work is required in an alternative relevant model to\nunderstand the effectiveness of the embolisation procedure\nand the tendency for recanalisation of the vessel.\n5 Conclusions\nHigh molecular weight alginate gel beads have been\nevaluated in vitro and in vivo to establish whether their\nphysical properties show the capability to be considered as\nan embolisation device. Both the in vitro and in vivo data\ndemonstrate good delivery, with no tendency to block\ncatheters or fragment owing to compressibility properties\ncomparable to current commercially-available embolic\nbeads. In vitro, swelling was noted almost immediately and\nafter 12 weeks the first signs of degradation were observed,\nalthough little difference was noted in vivo. This study has\nshown that high molecular weight alginate gel beads are\nwell tolerated by the body, but beads susceptible to\ninflammatory cell infiltration were more often associated\nwith surrounding thrombus. The thrombus presumably acts\nas a focus for inflammatory cell infiltration during\nremodelling of the vessel post embolisation. The beads\nwere shown to be easy to handle and were still observable\nlargely intact in histological sections after 3 months in\nvivo. The beads handle well and are robust enough to be\ndelivered through a 2.7 Fr microcatheter, which is a com-\nmonly used product in UFE procedures. This study has\ndemonstrated that high molecular weight, high purity\nalginate beads can be considered as semi-permanent em-\nbolisation beads, with the potential to resorb over time.\nAcknowledgements RF would like to acknowledge funding for a\nPhD provided under a Fellowship of the Royal Commission of 1851.\nWe would like to thank Dr Michel Wassef, Service d\u2019Anatomie\nPathologique, Ho\u02c6pital Lariboisie`re for his kind opinion on some of the\nhistological analyses.
