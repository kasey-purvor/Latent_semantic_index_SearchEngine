The processes of urbanization that build and tear up the capitalist city have often been treated as power-saturated, particularly by critical geographers and sociologists, and as a result the discourses and visual imagery that emerge in the production of the built environment have often been interpreted as \"spatial inscriptions of social conflict\" (Merrifield 1993: 1281).
