Although faces are more or less symmetrical, 22 \nhuman face perception (i.e. judgement of gender, age, expression, likeness and 23 \nattractiveness) mostly relies on facial information contained in the right side of the owners\u2019 24 \nface (left side of the viewed face from viewer\u2019s perspective) (e.g. Gilbert and Bakan 1973; 25 \n 3\nGrega et al 1988; Burt and Perrett 1997). For instance, when asked to judge the facial 1 \nexpression of a briefly presented chimeric face image, in which the left and right side of the 2 \nviewed face differ on facial expression, human viewers tend to base their decision more 3 \nfrequently on the expression contained within the right side of the owner\u2019s face, i.e. the left 4 \nhemiface for the viewer. This left perceptual bias in face perception is often accompanied 5 \nand enhanced by a left gaze bias (LGB), defined by the higher probability of first gaze and 6 \na higher proportion of viewing time directed at the left hemiface, when actively exploring 7 \nface images (Mertens et al. 1993; Philips and David 1997; Butler et al. 2005; Bulter and 8 \nHarvey 2006). In other words, the left hemiface is often inspected first and\/or for longer 9 \nperiods.  10 \nAlthough human visuospatial attention bias is to the left visual field (Rhodes 1986; 11 \nVaid and Singh 1989; Nicholls and Roberts 2002; Niemeier et al. 2007) and in some 12 \ncultures, a long practised left-to-right directional scanning bias (most notably, reading) 13 \n(Gilbert and Bakan 1973; Vaid and Singh 1989; Heath et al. 2005) may contribute to this 14 \ngaze asymmetry, it is often argued that a right hemisphere advantage in face processing 15 \n(receiving visual input from left visual field) is the likely cause of LGB (Burt and Perrett 16 \n1997; Butler et al. 2005; Leonards and Scott-Samuel 2005). As a consequence, if a face is 17 \ninitially presented within a viewer\u2019s central visual field, the left hemiface is projected to the 18 \nface-sensitive right hemisphere, where its saliency is more readily evaluated, causing an 19 \nincrease in the viewer\u2019s attention as necessary. A recent study of judging the gender of 20 \nchimeric faces showed that on trials where participants based their decision on the gender 21 \ncues contained in the left side of the chimeric face, they fixated more often and longer on 22 \nthe left hemiface (Bulter et al. 2005), further suggesting that LGB is closely associated with 23 \nthe perceptual processing of facial information, and could be part of eye scanning patterns 24 \nassociated with face exploration. 25 \n 4\nHowever, it remains unclear how this face-related LGB develops in human and 1 \nwhether it is restricted to human or could evolve (homologously or analogously) in other 2 \nspecies living in complex social environments. To address these questions, we 3 \nsystematically investigated gaze asymmetries in two comparative studies investigating gaze 4 \ndirection in human infants and adults and also in rhesus monkeys and domestic dogs while 5 \nexploring various images of faces and objects. 6 \n 7 \nExperiment 1:  LGB in human infants and adults: developmental study 8 \nIt has been suggested that human face processing involves a face-specific cognitive 9 \nand neural mechanism (McKone et al. 2006; see also Tarr and Cheng 2003) which is 10 \nspecies- and orientation-sensitive. Specifically, human adults differentiate faces of their 11 \nown species (or even own race) better than faces of other species (or other races). However, 12 \nthis superior recognition performance deteriorates once the face is turned up-side down, 13 \nand such a face inversion effect, one hallmark differentiating face processing from object 14 \nprocessing, is more evident for own species, i.e. stronger for human than monkey faces 15 \n(Diamond and Carey 1986; Tanaka et al. 2004; Bukach et al. 2006; McKone et al. 2006; 16 \nMondloch et al. 2006). It is likely that this sensitivity towards conspecific faces with 17 \nupright orientation is closely associated with or even shaped by our extensive experience of 18 \nidentifying upright conspecific faces, probably through the process of perceptual narrowing 19 \n(Pascalis et al. 2001, 2002; Grossmann and Johnson 2007). For instance, 6-month-old 20 \nhuman infants perform equally well at discriminating individual human or monkey faces, 21 \nbut 9-month-olds start to show better performance for recognizing human faces (Pascalis et 22 \nal. 2002).  23 \nIf the LGB is closely associated with the processing of facial information, it could 24 \nalso be expected to show not only sensitivity to the orientation and species of the viewed 25 \n 5\nface, but also differences during development. We examined these questions systematically 1 \nin this study by comparing gaze asymmetries in human infants and adults while free 2 \nviewing various face and object images with normal and inverted orientation. As face 3 \ninversion alters global facial configuration but does not change image symmetry along 4 \nvertical axis nor the local image properties of individual facial features (i.e. local contrast), 5 \ninverted faces not only serve as ideal control images for upright faces, but also contribute 6 \nto efforts to address the neural mechanisms underling LGB if different patterns of gaze 7 \nasymmetries are elicited in response to upright and inverted faces.  8 \n 9 \nMethod 10 \nNineteen 6-month-old infants (11 boys and 8 girls, 4.9 \u2013 7.7 months old with mean 11 \nof 6.22 \u00b1 0.22 (mean \u00b1 SEM)) and 19 adults (11 males and 8 females, 19-39 years old with 12 \nmean of 20.84 \u00b1 1.13) participated in the study. All children were born full-term and were 13 \nin good health. Ethical approval had been granted and all procedures complied with British 14 \nPsychological Society Ethical guidance. 15 \nVisual stimuli included 20 face images with neutral facial expression (5 upright and 16 \n5 inverted human faces, 5 upright and 5 inverted monkey faces) and 10 symmetrical 17 \ninanimate object images (see image examples in Fig. 1). The common object images were 18 \nsampled from our daily environment, and could be categorically familiar to the infants as 19 \nindicated by the parents. The gray scale digitized images were gamma-corrected and back-20 \nprojected once at eye-level on the center of a projection screen with a resolution of 21 \n600\u00d7600 pixels. No two images of the same category were presented consecutively. At a 22 \nviewing distance of 70cm the image subtended a visual angle of 72\u00d772\u00b0.  23 \nThe intermodal preferential looking paradigm (Meints et al. 1999) was employed to 24 \nmeasure gaze preference.  During the experiments the infants were seated on their parent\u2019s 25 \n 6\nlap in a quiet, dim-lit test room, and binocularly viewed the display. The parents were 1 \nasked to close their eyes during the experiment and to listen to instructions played over 2 \nheadphones which reminded them to sit quietly and to keep the infant seated in a central 3 \nposition. The trial was started with a flashing red fixation point (FP, 8\u00b0 in diameter) 4 \npresented on the centre of the screen. The infant\u2019s head and eye positions were on-line 5 \nmonitored by the researcher through CCTV. Once the infant\u2019s gaze was oriented towards 6 \nthe FP, a single image was presented for 5 seconds. The onset of the image presentation 7 \nwas accompanied by a female auditory instruction \u201clook\u201d delivered through a loudspeaker 8 \npositioned centrally above the displayed images. 9 \nDuring the experiment, the researcher was not visible. The overall order of all trials 10 \nshown to a given infant was pseudo-randomised. Inter-trial intervals varied with the 11 \ninfant\u2019s attention on the task with a minimum duration of 0.5 second. A new trial was not 12 \nlaunched until infants had centred their gaze either spontaneously or when attracted by the 13 \nflashing FP. All of the tested infants successfully completed all the trials (30 in total). The 14 \nsame procedure, but without a parent, was employed for the testing of human adults. 15 \nThe participant\u2019s eye position and head movements were recorded by two miniature 16 \ncameras, and then digitized with a sampling frequency of 60 Hz. The data image was replayed 17 \noff-line frame by frame for accurate analysis by two researchers independently. The direction 18 \nof participant\u2019s gaze was classified as \u2018left\u2019, \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018central\u2019 looking accordingly. The 19 \nresearchers were blind to the test images for each trial when performing off-line data analysis, 20 \nand inter-judge reliability measures between two researchers yielded correlations of 0.96 for 21 \ninfants\u2019 data, and 0.95 for adults\u2019 data. 22 \n. 23 \nResults  24 \n 7\nTo address when and how the LGB develops in humans, we compared the gaze 1 \npreferences of 19 6-month-old human infants and 19 adults while free viewing human and 2 \nmonkey faces (both upright and inverted) and symmetric familiar object images. The 3 \nimages of different categories appeared to attract about the same amount of viewing time 4 \nwithin the group of infants (Table 1). On average, human infants spent 64-69% (ANOVA, 5 \nFB(4,94)B=0.46, P=0.76) of the 5-second image presentation time viewing different classes of 6 \nface and object images. By contrast human adults spent 96-98% (ANOVA, FB(4,94)B=0.68, 7 \nP=0.60) of the time viewing the different images classes. 8 \nWe then examined whether the left hemi-image attracted a higher probability of 9 \nfirst gaze direction after image presentation, and a higher proportion of viewing time 10 \nduring image presentation. Paired one-tailed t-tests were used for each image category after 11 \nan ANOVA test to determine a significant general main effect of left-right bias across all 12 \nimage categories. We also calculated Prep and effect sizes (d) to estimate the probability of 13 \nreplicating the effect (TKilleenTT TT2005T). Human infants showed a consistent general LGB 14 \nwhile exploring the images (ANOVA, first gaze direction: FB(1,189)B=27.15, P=5.11E-7, Fig. 15 \n1A; viewing time: FB(1,189)B=35.38, P=1.38E-8, Fig.1B). Specifically, the left side of upright 16 \nhuman and monkey faces were inspected first (>63% of probability, t(18)=1.96 and 2.68, 17 \np=0.03 and 0.007, Prep=0.9 and 0.99, d=0.83 and 1.05) and longer (>59% of image 18 \nviewing time, t(18)=1.74 and 2.89, p=0.05 and 0.005, Prep=0.94 and 0.99, d=0.79 and 19 \n1.33) as were the left sides of object images (first gaze direction: t(18)=1.97, p=0.03, 20 \nPrep=0.96, d=0.91; viewing time: t(18)=1.75, p=0.048, Prep=0.95, d=0.81), suggesting a 21 \nnon-face-specific gaze asymmetry. Furthermore, the left side of inverted monkey faces also 22 \nattracted longer viewing time (t(18)=2.51, p=0.01, Prep=0.94; d=0.96), suggesting that the 23 \ngaze asymmetry in 6-month-olds is not sensitive to face orientation in species other than 24 \ntheir own.  25 \n 8\nHuman adults also demonstrated general main effect of LGB for image exploration 1 \n(ANOVA, first gaze direction: FB(1,189)B=88.04, P=2.8E-17, Fig. 1C; viewing time: 2 \nFB(1,189)B=11.82, P=7.27E-4, Fig.1D). However, when taking individual image category into 3 \naccount, a more restricted pattern of LGB was revealed: the adults showed a clear LGB 4 \nonly towards faces, not objects. Although the left sides of both upright and inverted human 5 \nor monkey faces were inspected first (t(18)=2.35\u20135.71, p=0.00001\u20130.02, Prep=0.94\u20130.99), 6 \nonly the left side of human upright faces was inspected for a longer period (t(18)=2.28, 7 \np=0.02, Prep=0.93; d=0.93), suggesting that in adults, the LGB is face-specific and also 8 \nsensitive to face orientation and species. Overall, infant results displayed a larger data 9 \nvariance than the adult population. This is not uncommon in infant studies and 10 \ndemonstrates the variability in development and lack of refinement of the process in this 11 \npopulation compared to an identically sized adult population. 12 \n 13 \nDiscussion 14 \nOur differing observations in human infants and adults suggest that the specific 15 \nLGB towards faces is an acquired behaviour, possibly through the process of \u201cperceptual 16 \nnarrowing\u201d. It has been proposed that the development of face perception is a modality-17 \nspecific and experience-dependent process of gradual specialisation (de Haan et al. 2002; 18 \nGrossmann and Johnson 2007). For instance, 6-month-old infants are equally good at 19 \nrecognising individual monkey and human faces, but 9-month-olds show a marked 20 \nadvantage in recognizing human faces (Pascalis et al. 2002), indicating a narrowing or 21 \nspecialising of perceptual ability in face perception. Similarly, young infants show a 22 \ngeneral, inherent LGB for all visual images, which later transforms itself into a more 23 \nspecific LGB for human faces only. Studies of perceptual asymmetries in face processing 24 \nhave previously shown that by the age of 5 years, children demonstrate a face-specific left 25 \n 9\nperceptual bias (Failla et al. 2003) and that its magnitude increases from 6 to 10-years of 1 \nage (Chiang et al. 2000). 2 \nThe different patterns of gaze asymmetry when viewing different image categories 3 \nin human adults also shed some light onto possible neural mechanism underling this LGB 4 \nphenomenon. The LGB was most evident for upright faces, less evident for inverted faces 5 \nand totally absent for object images, suggesting that the visuospatial attention bias towards 6 \nthe left visual field (Rhodes 1986; Nicholls and Roberts 2002; Niemeier et al. 2007) and 7 \nour extensively-practised left-to-right directional scanning bias (Gilbert and Bakan 1973; 8 \nVaid and Singh 1989; Heath et al. 2005) cannot fully account for the observed face-specific 9 \nLGB. The well documented human right-hemispheric advantage for face processing, on the 10 \nother hand, offers a consistent explanation. Various brain imaging studies have revealed a 11 \nstrong right-hemispheric bias in processing upright faces, delayed and reduced right-12 \nhemisphere response in processing inverted faces, and bilateral responses in processing 13 \nobject images (e.g. Rossion et al. 2003; Yovel and Kanwisher 2005; Bukach et al. 2006; 14 \nGrossmann and Johnson 2007). Our observed systematic change of LGB pattern towards 15 \ndifferent image categories seems to be consistent with reported changes of the distribution 16 \nof cortical responses, providing further support for cortical lateralisation in human face 17 \nprocessing. 18 \nThe ability to detect\/recognize facial cues (i.e. facial expression, gaze direction) and 19 \nto respond accordingly also plays a crucial role in social communication of non-human 20 \nprimates and other social species (e.g. Emery 2000; Parr et al. 2000; Hare and Tomasello 21 \n2005), but the broader biological context of this phenomenon has been largely ignored until 22 \nnow. It has been suggested that functional brain lateralisation in perception and cognition is 23 \nnot a uniquely human attribute, but exists in other non-human social species which could 24 \nbe shaped by the selection pressure of living in complex social environments and 25 \n 10\nperforming intensive social communication during the evolution, at least at population 1 \nlevel (e.g. Vallortigara and Rogers 2005). As in humans, the dominant role of the right 2 \nhemisphere in social cognition as well as in individual recognition mediated by visual cues 3 \nhas been observed in other social species such as fish (Sovrano et al. 1999), domestic 4 \nchicks (Vallortigara 1992; Vllortigara and Andrew 1991, 1994), quails (Zucca and Sovrano 5 \n2008), sheep (Kendrick 2006), monkeys (Hamilton and Vermeire 1988; Hauser 1993; 6 \nVermeire and Hamilton 1998) and chimpanzees (Morris and Hopkins 1993). 7 \nWe hypothesise that if the LGB is mediated by a right hemisphere bias in face 8 \nprocessing and if it is of broader adaptive value to social species, then it may also occur 9 \namong non-human species adapted to living in complex social environments. This 10 \npossibility is examined in our second study in which we investigated gaze asymmetries in 11 \nrhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) and domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) while exploring 12 \nvarious face and object images. Macaques were chosen because of their relatively close 13 \nevolutionary relationship to humans, and their naturally complex social environment; 14 \nwhereas dogs were chosen because they are more distantly related, but given their close 15 \nsocial association with humans and enculturation, they might also benefit from such a 16 \ncapacity of LGB, if it is indeed associated with social cognition. 17 \n 18 \nExperiment 2: LGB in rhesus monkeys and domestic dogs: phylogenetic study 19 \nTo address the question of whether a face-specific LGB is restricted to human or to 20 \nprimate species, or whether it is perhaps found more extensively among species living in 21 \ncomplex social environments, we examined the responses of rhesus monkeys (Macaca 22 \nmulatta) and domestic dogs (Canis familiaris). As rhesus monkeys rely heavily on facial 23 \ncues for social communication (Rosenfeld and van Hoesen 1979; Mendelson et al. 1982; 24 \nParr et al. 2000) and possess a similar oculomotor strategy and cortical mechanism for face 25 \n 11\nperception as humans (Rossion and Gauthier 2002; Guo et al. 2003; Guo 2007), we 1 \nhypothesised that laboratory-raised monkeys might be good non-human candidates for the 2 \ndemonstration of a LGB while viewing faces of conspecifics and humans. Domestic dogs, 3 \non the other hand, have been domesticated for at least 10,000 years and possibly much 4 \nlonger (Vil\u00e0 et al. 1997). They have shown greater attachment (Top\u00e1l et al. 2005) and 5 \nattention bias (Mikl\u00f3si et al. 2003; Vir\u00e1nyi et al. 2008) towards people compared to their 6 \nclose relative, the wolf. Their sensitivity to human cues exceeds that of non-human 7 \nprimates in certain tasks such as following human gaze directional cues, and it is 8 \nhypothesised that they may have evolved a special predisposition for communicating with 9 \nhumans (Hare et al. 2002; Mikl\u00f3si et al. 2003; Hare and Tomasello 2005). Pet dogs are 10 \nadditionally encultured into the human environment and so such biases may be further 11 \nadapted in this subpopulation.  Consequently, pet dogs were chosen as a non-primate social 12 \nspecies that might benefit from any adaptive advantage associated with a LGB towards 13 \nhuman faces and possibly other dog faces, but not necessarily towards faces from other 14 \nspecies or objects. 15 \n 16 \nMethod 17 \nRecording from rhesus monkeys  18 \nThree male adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta, 4.5-6.0 kg) were tested in this 19 \nstudy at the Department of Psychology, University of Newcastle upon Tyne. Initially, the 20 \nmonkeys were trained to fixate on a FP on a computer screen for several seconds in a 21 \ndimming fixation detection task (Guo and Benson 1998). For the purpose of eye movement 22 \nrecordings, a scleral eye coil and head restraint were then implanted under aseptic 23 \nconditions. Throughout the period of the recordings, the animal\u2019s weight and general health 24 \nwere monitored daily. Ethical approval had been granted and all procedures complied with 25 \n 12\nthe \u201cPrinciples of laboratory animal care\u201d (NIH publication no. 86-23, revised 1985) and 1 \nUK Home Office regulations.   2 \nVisual stimuli were generated using a VSG 2\/3W graphics system (Cambridge 3 \nResearch Systems) and displayed on a high frequency non-interlaced gamma-corrected 4 \ncolor monitor (110 Hz, Sony GDM-F500T9) with the resolution of 1024\u00d7768 pixels. At a 5 \nviewing distance of 57 cm the monitor subtended a visual angle of 40\u00d730\u00b0.  The mean 6 \nluminance of uniform grey background was kept at 6.0 cd\/mP2 P. 7 \nTwenty monkey and 20 human face images with neutral facial expressions were 8 \nused as stimuli (see image examples in Fig. 2). The gray scale digitized images were 9 \ngamma-corrected and displayed once in a random order at the center of the screen with a 10 \nresolution of 512\u00d7512 pixels (20\u00d720\u00b0 visual angle). 11 \nDuring the experiments the monkeys were seated in a purpose-built primate chair 12 \nwith their head restrained, and they viewed the display binocularly. To calibrate eye 13 \nmovement signals, a small red FP (0.2\u00b0 diameter, 7.8 cd\/mP2 Pluminance) was displayed 14 \nrandomly at one of twenty-five positions (5\u00d75 matrix) across the monitor. The distance 15 \nbetween adjacent FP positions was 5\u00b0. The monkey was trained to follow the FP and 16 \nmaintain fixation for 1 second. After the calibration procedure, the trial was started with a 17 \nFP displayed on the center of monitor, and the monkey\u2019s eye positions were on-line 18 \nmonitored by the custom-made software. If the monkey maintained fixation for 1 second, 19 \nthe FP disappeared and a single face image was presented for 10 seconds. During the 20 \npresentation, three monkeys passively viewed monkey face images, and two of them also 21 \nviewed human face images. No reinforcement was given during this procedure, neither 22 \nwere the animals trained on any other task with these stimuli, which could have potentially 23 \naffected their behavior. It was considered that with their lack of training, and in the absence 24 \nof instrumental responding, their behavior should be as natural as possible.  25 \n 13\nHorizontal and vertical eye positions were measured using an 18-inch cubic scleral 1 \nsearch coil assembly with 6 min arc sensitivity (CNC Engineering). Eye movement signals 2 \nwere amplified by a CNC system and sampled at 500 Hz through the analogue inputs of 3 \nCED1401 plus digital interface (Cambridge Electronic Design). The data were then 4 \nanalysed off-line using software developed in Matlab. The software computed horizontal 5 \nand vertical eye displacement signals as a function of time to determine eye velocity and 6 \nposition. Fixation locations were then extracted from the raw eye tracking data using 7 \nvelocity (less than 0.2\u00b0 eye displacement at a velocity of less than 20\u00b0\/s) and duration 8 \n(greater than 50 ms) criteria (Guo et al. 2003, 2006). 9 \nRecording from pet dogs 10 \nSeventeen adult domestic pet dogs (Canis familiaris, 2-7 years old, 3 Labrador, 3 11 \nBorder Collie, 3 Lurcher, 2 Jack Russell, 1 Border Terrier, 1 Leonberger, 1 Schnauzer, 1 12 \nStaffordshire Terrier, 1 Spanish Water Dog, 1 Golden Cocker Spaniel) were recruited from 13 \nuniversity staff and students for this experiment. University ethical approval had been 14 \ngranted and all procedures complied with ethical guidance of the International Society for 15 \nApplied Ethology.  16 \nVisual stimuli were generated using customized presentation software and back-17 \nprojected on the center of a projection screen. At a viewing distance of 41 cm the screen 18 \nsubtended a visual angle of 100\u00d7163\u00b0.  30 face images with neutral facial expressions and 19 \n10 symmetrical inanimate object images were used as stimuli (see image examples in Fig. 20 \n2). The face images included 5 upright and 5 inverted human faces, 5 upright and 5 21 \ninverted monkey faces, 5 upright and 5 inverted dog faces. The common object images 22 \nwere sampled from the daily environment, and could be categorically familiar to the dogs 23 \nas indicated by the owners. The gray scale digitized images were gamma-corrected and 24 \ndisplayed once in a random order at the center of the screen with a resolution of 600\u00d7600 25 \n 14\npixels (87\u00d787\u00b0 visual angle). No two images of the same category were presented 1 \nconsecutively. To reduce degree of left-right image asymmetry commonly associated with 2 \ndog faces (i.e. facial color\/hair pattern), we created left-mirror left composite chimeric 3 \nimages for 8 dog faces and 8 object images used in this experiment. This manipulation is 4 \nwidely adopted in studies of left perceptual bias and left gaze bias in face processing, and 5 \nhas generated consistent observation similar as those generated by natural face images 6 \nacross different laboratories, for human participants (e.g. Mertens et al. 1993; Butler et al. 7 \n2005; Leonards and Scott-Samuel 2005).  8 \nThe preferential-looking procedure was adapted to test dog\u2019s gaze preference 9 \n(Meints et al. 1999). During the experiment the dog was seated in a quiet, dim-lit test room 10 \nand binocularly viewed the display which was 41 cm away. A researcher stood behind the 11 \ndog and did not interfere with the dog or coerce it to watch the screen. The dog owner was 12 \ninstructed to keep quiet and stay outside of the test room. A CCTV camera (SONY SSC-13 \nM388CE, resolution: 380 horizontal) placed in front of the dog was used to monitor and 14 \nrecord the dog\u2019s eye and head movements. The trial was started with a flashing red FP (10\u00b0 15 \nin diameter) presented in the centre of the screen at the dog\u2019s eye level. The dog\u2019s head and 16 \neye positions were on-line monitored by the researcher through CCTV. Once the dog\u2019s 17 \ngaze was oriented towards the FP a single image was presented for 5 seconds. During the 18 \npresentation, the dog passively viewed face and object images. No reinforcement was given 19 \nduring this procedure, neither were the dogs trained on any other task with these stimuli. A 20 \nshort break was provided after every 10 trials if necessary. All of the dogs successfully 21 \ntested completed at least 65% of the trials (82 \u00b1 2%). 22 \nThe dog\u2019s eye and head movements were recorded and then digitised with a sampling 23 \nfrequency of 60 Hz. The image was replayed off-line frame by frame for accurate analysis by 24 \ntwo researchers independently, and the direction of the dog\u2019s gaze was classified as \u2018left\u2019, 25 \n 15\n\u2018right\u2019 and \u2018central\u2019 looking accordingly. The researchers were blind to the test images for each 1 \ntrial when performing off-line data analysis, and inter-judge reliability measures yielded 2 \ncorrelations of 0.98 between two researchers. 3 \n 4 \nResults 5 \nWe very precisely recorded monkeys\u2019 gaze patterns with implanted scleral search 6 \ncoils, but the invasive nature of this recording methodology restricts the number of 7 \nmonkeys that can be ethically used in such studies (e.g. Guo et al. 2003, 2006). Therefore 8 \nthe analysis was carried out after pooling the data from three monkeys (i.e. t-test was 9 \nperformed over the trials rather than subjects). As we did not intend to quantitatively 10 \ncompare the magnitude of LGB across different species in this study, such an approach can 11 \nhelp to qualitatively establish whether the face-related LGB exists in non-human primates.  12 \nNo statistical difference was observed in the cumulative viewing time across the 13 \nentire set of human and monkey faces with different orientations (Table 1). The monkeys 14 \non average spent 44-52% of image presentation time viewing different categories of face 15 \nimages (ANOVA, FB(3,132)B=1.52, P=0.21). ANOVA tests of main effect of left-right bias 16 \nacross all images revealed a general LGB associated with face exploration (first gaze 17 \ndirection: FB(1,261)B=8.47, P=0.004, Fig. 2A; viewing time: FB(1,261)B=12.51, P=1.0E-6, Fig.2B). 18 \nSpecifically, the left side of upright monkey and human faces had a significantly higher 19 \nprobability of being the first saccade destination (77% and 65% for monkey and human 20 \nfaces; paired one-tailed t-test, t(59)=4.84 and 1.96, p=4.81E-6 and 0.03, Prep=0.99 and 21 \n0.91) than the right hemiface, and attracted more fixations (61% and 60% of total fixations 22 \nper image for monkey and human faces; t(59)=4.37and 4.01, p=2.52E-5 and 1.3E-4, 23 \nPrep=0.99 and 0.98). Once the faces were inverted, although image symmetry was constant 24 \n 16\nalong the vertical axis, the left and right hemiface appeared to be equally salient 1 \n(t(17)=0.17-0.46, p=0.33-0.43). 2 \nThe highly sensitive technique used in laboratory monkeys was not appropriate for 3 \npet dogs and so the preferential looking paradigm was used to compare the gaze 4 \npreferences of 17 owner-volunteered dogs while viewing human, dog and monkey faces, 5 \nand symmetrical object images. On average, the dogs spent 43-47% of the 5-second image 6 \npresentation time inspecting different types of face and object images (Table1), and no 7 \nsignificant difference in viewing time was observed across these image categories 8 \n(ANOVA, FB(6,118)B=0.51, P=0.80).  9 \nAnalysis of gaze preference showed a significant main effect of general LGB for 10 \nimage viewing (first gaze direction: FB(1,237)B=20.59, P=9.28E-6; viewing time: FB(1,237)B=14.95, 11 \nP=1.45E-4). Paired one-tailed t-test further revealed that the left side of both upright and 12 \ninverted human faces had a higher probability of being the first inspected region by the 13 \ndogs (65% and 67% for upright and inverted human faces; t(16)=2.99 and 3.18, p=0.004 14 \nand 0.003, Prep=0.97 and 0.97; Fig. 2C). There was no significant difference in the 15 \nprobability of first inspection between the two sides of dog faces, monkey faces and object 16 \nimages (t(16)=0.27-1.12, p=0.14\u20130.40). An analysis of the averaged proportion of viewing 17 \ntime towards each side of the images within a trial showed that only the left side of upright 18 \nhuman faces attracted significantly longer inspection (62% of total viewing time; 19 \nt(16)=2.67, p=0.008, Prep=0.95; Fig 2D). The dogs spent a similar amount of looking time 20 \nat both sides of the images while viewing inverted human faces, both upright and inverted 21 \ndog or monkey faces, and object images (t(16)=0.52-1.69, p=0.06-0.30). 22 \n 23 \nDiscussion 24 \n 17\nOur observations show that gaze asymmetry is not restricted to humans, and could 1 \nhave broader adaptive significance. Laboratory-raised monkeys showed a LGB towards 2 \nfaces of conspecifics and humans while pet dogs only demonstrated a LGB towards human 3 \nfaces, but not monkey or dog faces, nor towards object images. We suggest that these 4 \nspecific results are compatible with the animals\u2019 normal communicative strategies given 5 \nmonkeys\u2019 reliance on social cues and dogs\u2019 unique evolutionary and ontogenetic history. 6 \nAll dogs in this study were well socialised to both people and other dogs. We therefore 7 \nargue that the bias towards human faces alone cannot be explained simply in terms of lack 8 \nof exposure to conspecifics, but that it may have a more fundamental phylogenetic origin. 9 \nThe ability to extract information from human faces and respond appropriately could have 10 \nhad a selective advantage during the process of domestication, especially as the emotional 11 \ncontent of these faces may be of immediate adaptive behavioural significance. Indeed, 12 \nrecent studies have shown that the owner\u2019s right hemiface (left hemiface from viewer\u2019s 13 \nperspective) can express a range of emotional expressions more accurately, and more 14 \nimportantly, can express specifically the negative expression of, evoked anger, more 15 \nintensely (e.g. Indersmitten and Gur 2003). As the LGB directs the viewer\u2019s attention to 16 \nthis side of face image, it could help the viewer detect and recognize biologically important 17 \ninformation more quickly and precisely in faces of functional significance.  18 \nThe maintenance of the bias by dogs towards inverted human faces may also be 19 \nspecifically important for this species. Dogs will frequently roll over and look up at human 20 \nfaces in initial social exchanges as an appeasement gesture and the ability to read the 21 \nhuman face in this context may be important to establish if appeasement has succeeded. If 22 \nLGB has its origins in right hemisphere specialisation for facial processing, it would be 23 \nsurprising if the behaviour could be reversed when the dog is viewing a face upside down, 24 \nalthough this would allow preferential inspection of the right side of the viewee\u2019s face. 25 \n 18\nDogs may not show a bias towards monkey faces because of their unfamiliarity or 1 \nirrelevance compared to human faces, although the differentiating criteria remain to be 2 \nestablished.  However, a failure to show LGB towards dog faces might reflect a reduced 3 \ndependence on facial processing in the initial assessment of conspecifics in this species, 4 \nwith greater facial asymmetry in this species and non-facial greeting including olfactory 5 \ncues and visual cues of body postures perhaps being of greater significance.  6 \n 7 \nGeneral discussion 8 \nWith the presentation of object images and faces of different species with upright 9 \nand inverted orientation, in this comparative study we systematically examined the face-10 \nrelated LGB, defined by the higher probability of first gaze and a higher proportion of 11 \nviewing time directed at the left hemiface, in human infants, human adults, rhesus monkeys 12 \nand domestic dogs. While human infants showed a more general bias towards the left side 13 \nof a visual image (mostly for upright images), adults demonstrated a very specific LGB 14 \ntowards upright human faces only. Laboratory-reared monkeys showed selective LGB 15 \ntowards upright human and monkey faces, while pet dogs only attended to the left side of 16 \nhuman faces. Taken together, our results suggest that the face-specific LGB is not apparent 17 \nin human infants, but develops over time; also, our evidence shows that the LGB is not a 18 \nhuman-specific phenomenon, but seems to have broader adaptive value to social species. 19 \nInterestingly, both human adults and dogs demonstrated a LGB towards a broader 20 \nrange of face types at the earliest stage of face viewing (human and monkey faces with 21 \ndifferent orientations for human observers, upright and inverted human faces for dogs; Fig. 22 \n1C and 2C), adding further support to the hypothesis that the initial gaze bias for faces is 23 \nautomatic and internally-driven (Leonards and Scott-Samuel 2005), probably initiated by 24 \nthe gist configuration of face stimuli. After initial analysis, the LGB could be refined 25 \n 19\ntowards more efficient processing of biologically relevant faces (in our case, upright human 1 \nfaces for both adult human participants and pet dogs, Fig. 1D and 2D), and would be less 2 \nevident for irrelevant faces or inverted faces as face inversion would alter global 3 \nconfiguration of facial features and reduce efficiency and accuracy of face processing 4 \n(Valentine 1988; Rossion and Gauthier 2002). A recent correlation study in humans also 5 \nsuggests that only an overall leftward face scanning bias (i.e. total number of left hemiface 6 \nfixation within a trial), rather than initial gaze bias, can be correlated with perceptual 7 \nprocessing of facial cues (Bulter et al. 2005). 8 \nIn our study, we did not observe a consistent gaze bias towards object images in 9 \nhuman adults and dogs, or towards inverted faces in monkeys. This observation rules out 10 \ngeneral preferential attention towards the left visual field and extensively-practised left-to-11 \nright scanning bias in humans as specific explanations for the LGB phenomenon. A recent 12 \nrecording of human saccadic eye movements in face processing also demonstrated that the 13 \ninitial gaze bias is the most evident while exploring upright faces, and is less or not evident 14 \nwhile exploring inverted faces and symmetric non-face object or landscape images 15 \n(Leonards and Scott-Samuel 2005). Taken together, the face- and orientation-sensitive 16 \nLGB we observed here is most likely due to a lateralised right hemisphere bias for face 17 \nprocessing which has been revealed by studies of brain imaging and patients with focal 18 \nbrain lesions (e.g. Farah and Aguirre 1999; Bukach et al. 2006; Grossmann and Johnson 19 \n2007).  20 \nUnlike humans and monkeys, relatively little is known about cerebral lateralization 21 \nin dogs from neuroimaging approach. However, some behaviour studies on paw preference 22 \n(Tan 1987; Wells 2003; Quaranta et al. 2004; Branson and Rogers 2006; Poyser et al. 23 \n2006) and tail-wagging response (Quaranta et al. 2007) have suggested a functional brain 24 \nasymmetry in dogs which may even correlate with their immune system function (Quaranta 25 \n 20\net al. 2006, 2008). The right hemisphere also has greater mass, and this appears to be 1 \nindependent of laterality in certain forms of motor behaviour (Tan and \u00c7al\u015fikan 1987), 2 \nwhich would be consistent with laterality in certain perceptual processes. Our observation 3 \nof LGB towards human faces provides new evidence to support this hypothesis, with brain 4 \nlateralization apparent in face processing in dogs. Furthermore, this prominent gaze 5 \nasymmetry could be a useful non-invasive tool in the wider study of some aspects of social 6 \ncognition (e.g. facial signalling) in those species who exhibit a bias. 7 \nAs the recognition of facial expression is a crucial part of social cognition, right 8 \nhemisphere dominance in emotional processing, such as in detecting facial movements (i.e. 9 \nlip smacking; Ferrari et al. 2003; Leslie et al. 2004) and judging negative emotions (i.e. fear 10 \nand anger; Asthana and Mandall 2001; Indersmitten and Gur 2003), may also steer the 11 \ninitiation of gaze asymmetry towards faces. Overall, it seems likely that the affective and 12 \nsemantic information contained in those faces with adaptive behavioural significance for 13 \nthe species concerned, are the most likely determinants of face-related LGB. In other 14 \nwords, the LGB may not just be initiated by the gist configuration of the faces in an 15 \nautomatic fashion, but is actively engaged in the processing of relevant facial cues. 16 \nConsequently, the amplitude of LGB could well be affected by different type of facial 17 \ninformation. This issue is currently under investigation by our group. 18 \n 19 \nReferences 20 \n 21 \nAsthana HS, Mandal MK (2001) Visual field bias in the judgment of facial expression of 22 \nemotion.
