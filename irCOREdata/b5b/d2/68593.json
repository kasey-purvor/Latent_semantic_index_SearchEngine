It is found that the\ngenerated vortices, if any, are being produced at densities at least 2 orders of magnitude less than might\nbe expected on the basis of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. [S0031-9007(98)07170-1]\nPACS numbers: 67.40.VsWhen a physical system passes rapidly enough through\na continuous phase transition, creation of topological de-\nfects is to be expected [1] owing to the causal discon-\nnection of separated regions. This idea was proposed by\nKibble [2] in connection with the GUT (grand unified\ntheory) symmetry-breaking phase transition of the early\nUniverse, and later developed in detail by Zurek [3\u20135]\nwho introduced simple physical arguments to estimate the\ndensity of defects in terms of the rate at which the sys-\ntem passes through the transition. Zurek also pointed out\nthat the process of defect production should be generic,\napplicable in principle to all continuous phase transitions,\nthus opening up the remarkable possibility of testing as-\npects of cosmological theories on the laboratory bench.\nThe first experiments of this kind were performed on liq-\nuid crystals [6,7] using weakly first-order phase transi-\ntions. Later, the corresponding experiments were carried\nout using the second-order superfluid phase transitions of\nliquid 4He [8] and liquid 3He [9,10]. In all cases, the gen-\nerated defect densities were reported as being consistent\nwith Zurek\u2019s [3\u20135] estimates. In this Letter we describe\nan improved version of the 4He experiment [8] in which\nparticular care has been taken to minimize the production\nof quantized vortices\u2014the relevant topological defects in\nliquid helium\u2014through ordinary hydrodynamic flow pro-\ncesses. As we shall see, our new results show no con-\nvincing evidence of any vortex creation at all, but they\nenable us to place an approximate upper bound on the\ninitial density of vortices produced via the Kibble-Zurek\nmechanism.\nThe lambda (superfluid) transition in liquid 4He pro-\nvided the basis of Zurek\u2019s original proposal [3] for a\ncosmological experiment. The underlying idea is very\nsimple. A small isolated volume of normal (nonsuper-\nfluid) liquid 4He is held under pressure, just above the\ntemperature Tl of the lambda transition. Although the\nlogarithmic infinity in its heat capacity at Tl makes it\nimpossible to cool the sample quickly into the super-\nfluid phase, Zurek pointed out that the pressure depen-\ndence of Tl meant that expansion of the sample would0031-9007y98y81(17)y3703(4)$15.00allow it to be taken through the transition very rapidly.\nThus, closely paralleling the processes through which\ntopological defects (e.g., cosmic strings [11]) are be-\nlieved to have been produced in the GUT phase transition\n10235 s after the big bang, huge densities of quantized\nvortices [12] should be produced at the transition. The\n\u201cbulk version\u201d [4] of this experiment was subsequently\nrealized [8] in a specially designed expansion appara-\ntus [13] in which second-sound attenuation was used\nto probe the decaying tangle of vortices created during\nthe expansion. The initial vortex density, obtained by\nback-extrapolation to the moment (t \u00ad 0) of traversing\nthe transition, was ,1012 1013 m22, consistent with the\ntheoretical expectation [3\u20135].\nAn unexpected observation in the initial experiments\n[8] was that small densities of vortices were created even\nfor expansions that occurred wholly in the superfluid\nphase, provided that the starting point was very close\nto Tl. The phenomenon was initially [13] attributed\nto vortices produced in thermal fluctuations within the\ncritical regime, but it was pointed out [14] that effects of\nthis kind are only to be expected for expansions starting\nwithin a few mK of the transition, i.e., much closer\nthan the typical experimental value of a few mK. The\nmost plausible interpretation\u2014that the vortices in question\nwere of conventional hydrodynamic origin, arising from\nnonidealities in the design of the expansion chamber\u2014was\ndisturbing, because expansions starting above Tl traverse\nthe same region. Thus some, at least, of the vortices seen\nin expansions through the transition were probably not\nattributable to the Zurek-Kibble mechanism as had been\nassumed. It has been of particular importance, therefore,\nto undertake a new experiment with as many as possible\nof the nonidealities in the original design eliminated or\nminimized.\nAn ideal experiment would be designed so as to avoid\nall fluid flow parallel to surfaces during the expansion.\nThis could in principle be accomplished by, e.g., the radial\nexpansion of a spherical volume, or the axial expansion\nof a cylinder with stretchy walls. In either of these cases,\u00a9 1998 The American Physical Society 3703\nVOLUME 81, NUMBER 17 P HY S I CA L REV I EW LE T T ER S 26 OCTOBER 1998the expansion would cause no relative motion of fluid and\nwalls in the direction parallel to the walls and presum-\nably, therefore, no hydrodynamic production of vortices.\nThe walls of the actual expansion chamber [8,13] were\nmade from bronze bellows, thus approximating the cylin-\nder with stretchy walls. Although there must, of course,\nbe some flow parallel to surfaces because of the convo-\nlutions, such effects are relatively small. It is believed\nthat the significant nonidealities, in order of importance,\narose from (a) expansion of liquid from the filling cap-\nillary, which was closed by a needle valve 0.5 m away\nfrom the cell, (b) expansion from the shorter capillary\nconnecting the cell to a Straty-Adams capacitive pres-\nsure gauge, and (c) flow past the fixed yoke on which\nthe second-sound transducers were mounted. In addi-\ntion (d) there were complications caused by the expan-\nsion system bouncing against the mechanical stop at room\ntemperature.\nThe new expansion cell, designed to avoid or minimize\nthese problems, is sketched in Fig. 1. The main changes\nfrom the original design are as follows: (a) the sample\nfilling capillary is now closed off at the cell itself, using\na hydraulically operated needle valve; (b) the connecting\ntube to the pressure gauge has been eliminated by making\nits flexible diaphragm part of the chamber end plate; (c) the\nsecond-sound transducers are also mounted flush with the\nend plates of the cell, eliminating any support structure\nwithin the liquid; (d) some damping of the expansion\nwas provided by the addition of a (light motor vehicle)\nhydraulic shock absorber.\nThe operation of the expansion apparatus and the tech-\nnique of data collection (analysis) were much as described\npreviously [8,13], except that the rate at which the sample\npassed through the lambda transition was determined di-\nrectly by simultaneous measurements of the position of the\npull rod (giving the volume of the cell, and hence its pres-\nsure) and the temperature of the cell. Distance from the\ntransition was defined in terms of the parameter\ne \u00ad\nTl 2 T\nTl\n. (1)\nThus the pressure dependence of Tl, and the nonconstant\nexpansion rate, were taken explicitly into account.

Sketch of the improved expansion cell.3704typical expansion is shown in Fig. 2. From such results,\nthe quench time\ntQ \u00ad\n1\nsdeydtde\u00ad0\n(2)\nis easily determined. In the case illustrated, it was tQ \u00ad\n17 6 1.0 ms. The position of the pull rod is measured\nwith a ferrite magnet attached to the rod, moving within a\ncoil fixed to the cryostat top plate. There is some evidence\nof a small time lag between the expansion of the cell\nunder the influence of the high-pressure liquid inside it and\nthe corresponding movement of the transducer. Thus the\nmeasured tQ may tend to overestimate the quench time\nslightly.\nFollowing an expansion though the transition, after T ,\nP, and the velocity c2 of second sound have settled at\nconstant values, a sequence of second-sound pulses is\npropagated through the liquid. If the anticipated tangle\nof vortices is present, the signal may be expected to grow\ntowards its vortex-free value as the tangle decays and\nthe attenuation decreases. Signal amplitudes measured\njust after two such expansions are shown by the data\npoints of Fig. 3. It is immediately evident that, unlike the\nresults obtained from the original cell [8], there is now\nno evidence of any systematic growth of the signals with\ntime or, correspondingly, for the creation of any vortices\nat the transition. One possible reason is that the density\nof vortices created is smaller than the theoretical estimates\n[3\u20135], but we must also consider the possibility that they\nare decaying faster than they can be measured: there is a\n\u201cdead period\u201d of about 50 ms after the mechanical shock of\nthe expansion, during which the resultant vibrations cause\nthe signals to be extremely noisy (which is why the error\nbars are large on early signals in Fig. 3).\n-400 -200 0 200 400 600\n-0.01\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n\u03b5\nt (\u00b5s)\nFIG. 2.

The curves refer\nto calculated signal evolutions for different initial line densities,\nfrom the bottom, of 1012, 1011, and 1010 m22.\nThe rate at which a tangle of vortices decays in this tem-\nperature range is determined by the Vinen [15] equation\ndL\ndt\n\u00ad 2x2\nh\u00af\nm4\nL2, (3)\nwhere L is the length of vortex line per unit volume, m4 is\nthe 4He atomic mass, and x2 is a dimensionless parameter.\nThe relationship between vortex line density and second-\nsound attenuation is known [12] from experiments on\nrotating helium, and may for present purposes be written\nin the form\nL \u00ad\n6c2 lnsS0ySd\nBkd\n, (4)\nwhere S0 and S are the signal amplitudes without and with\nvortices present, B is a temperature dependent parameter,\nk \u00ad hym4 is the quantum of circulation, and d is the\ntransducer separation.\nIntegrating (3) and inserting (4), one finds immediately\nthat the recovery of the signal should be of the form\u2022\nln\n\u00b5\nS0\nS\n\u00b6\u201a21\n\u00ad\n6c2\nkBd\n\u00b5\nx2\nk\n2p\nt 1 L21i\n\u00b6\n. (5)\nOf the constants in (5), all are known except x2 and B\nwhich seem not to have been measured accurately within\nthe temperature range of interest. We therefore performed\na subsidiary experiment, deliberately creating vortices by\nconventional means and then following their decay by\nmeasurements of the recovery of the second-sound signal\namplitude. This was accomplished by leaving the needle\nvalve open, so that ,0.2 cm3 of liquid from the dead\nvolume outside the needle-valve actuator bellows wasforcibly squirted into the cell during an expansion. As\nexpected, large densities of vortices were created. Plots of\nflnsSyS0dg21 as a function of t yielded straight lines within\nexperimental error in accordance with (5), as shown in\nFig. 4. By measurement of the gradient, and comparison\nwith (5), for a number of such plots it was possible to\ndetermine x2yB as a function of T and P. Fuller details\nwill be given elsewhere, but it was found that x2yB did\nnot exhibit a strong temperature dependence and could be\napproximated by x2yB \u00ad 0.004 6 0.001 within the range\nof interest where 0.02 , e , 0.06.\nThe measured value of x2yB was then used to calculate\nthe evolution of SyS0 with time for different values of Li ,\nyielding the curves shown in Fig. 3. From the tQ mea-\nsured from the gradient in Fig. 2, and Zurek\u2019s estimate of\nLi \u00ad\n1.2 3 1012\nstQy100 msd2y3\nsm22d , (6)\nwe are led to expect that Li \u00f8 4 3 1012 m22. A compari-\nson of the calculated curves and measured data in Fig. 3\nshows that this is plainly not the case. In fact, the data\nsuggest that Li is smaller than the expected value by at\nleast 2 orders of magnitude.\nThere are a number of comments to make on this null re-\nsult which, in the light of the apparently positive outcome\nfrom the earlier experiment [8], came as a considerable sur-\nprise. First, Zurek\u2019s estimates of Li were never expected\nto be accurate to better than 1, or perhaps 2, orders of mag-\nnitude, and his more recent estimate [16] suggests some-\nwhat lower defect densities. So it remains possible that his\npicture [3\u20135,16] is correct in all essential details, and that\nthe improved experiment with faster expansions now being\nplanned will reveal evidence of the Kibble-Zurek mecha-\nnism in action in liquid 4He. Second, it must be borne in\nmind that (3), and the value of xyB measured from the data\nof Fig. 4, refer to hydrodynamically generated vortex lines.\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n1\/\nln\n(S\n0\/S\n)\nt (s)\nFIG. 4.

It is not yet known for sure why this should\nbe, but an interesting explanation of the apparent discrep-\nancy is being proposed [18] by Karra and Rivers.\nWe acknowledge valuable discussions or correspon-\ndence with S.
