Thus the decay of surface roughness under different surface conditions was\ninvestigated and related to quantitative amounts of soil loss, runoff and sediment concentration in\na laboratory experiment.\nRainfall with an intensity of 128 mm\/h was applied to a bare or mulched surfaces of a sandy\nloam soil with known surface roughness at specified time intervals.\nThe decay of roughness as expressed by roughness ratio, in this experiment, was better predicted\nwhen related to an exponent function of square root of cumulative kinetic energy of rainfall\nrather than with the cumulative rainfall. The roughness decay equations in literature did not\npredict breakdown under mulched surfaces accurately. Thus the exponent parameters of the\nroughness decay equations were adjusted to reflect the reduced decay occurring under mulched\nsurfaces.\nIn a bare soil, regression equations expressing soil loss, runoff and sediment concentration as a\nfunction of inital roughness were significant, but with low coefficients of determination, being\n0.39, 0.12 and 0.36 respectively. In addition to initial roughness, cumulative kinetic energy of\nrainfall was further included in the regressions. This led to an increase in coefficients of\ndetermination being 0.81, 0.74 and 0.49 for soil loss, runoff and sediment concentration\nrespectively.\nSoil loss, runoff and sediment concentration as a function of initial roughness, final roughness\nand cumulative kinetic energy also gave significant regressions with coefficients of\ndetermination being 0.87, 0.85 and 0.51 respectively.\nThis work shows that soil loss and runoff could be predicted from bare soil surface provided the\ninitial roughness and the energy of rainfall is known. However, field verifications of these\nrelationships are needed under different tillage tools and under natural rainfall.\nIntroduction:\nTillage-induced roughness is an important factor, which affects many surface soil properties.\nAmong properties affected by the state of the surface roughness includes porosity (Burwell et al.,\n1963; Johnson et al. 1979), soil thermal properties and solar radiation reflection (Cruse et al.\n1980), infiltration of water into the soil (Magunda et al. 1997) and soil erosion (Johnson et al.,\n1979; Cogo et al., 1983).\nThe most studied aspect of surface roughness is its capacity to hold water temporarily in\ndepressions thus affecting runoff during rainfall events (Podmore & Huggins, 1980; Moore &\nLarson, 1979; Mitchell & Jones 1978).\nSeveral authors have shown that the amount of depression water storage is related to the level of\nroughness of the soil. However, tillage-induced roughness is very dynamic changing with\nsuccessive rainfall during the growing season. Thus to be able to predict the effect of roughness\non soil erosion, there is a need to understand the effect of rainfall on the decay of surface\nroughness and relate this changes in roughness to soil loss and runoff.\nThe decay of surface roughness has been found to decreased exponentially with increasing\nrainfall (Zobeck & Onstad, 1987, Romkens & Wang, 1987).\nWhile some authors have chosen exponent function of cumulative rainfall to describe the decay\nof surface roughness (Zobeck & Onstad, 1987; Romkens & Wang, 1985), others have used the\nkinetic energy of rainfall (Morgan et al, 1993; Dexter, 1977; Burwell and Larson, 1969).\nZobeck & Onstad (1987) proposed an equation relating random roughness ratio (RRR) to an\nexponent function of cumulative rainfall (equation 1)\nRRR = RRf \/ RRi = 0.89 e -0.026 P [1]\nRRR: Random roughness ratio\nRRf : Final soil roughness index (cm)\nRRi : Initial soil roughness index (cm)\nP : cumulative rainfall (cm)\nEquation 1 was derived based on the synthesis of some earlier works of Burwell & Larson 1969,\nJohnson et al., 1979, Onstad, 1984 and Steichen, 1984.\nThe equation 1 above explained 76% of the variations in the random roughness ratio among 418\ndata points for different primary tillage operations and soils.\nThe decay of surface roughness as proposed in European Soil Erosion Model (EUROSEM)\n(Morgan et al., 1993) is due to the kinetic energy of rainfall. Thus the equation relating random\nroughness ratio (RRR) to the square root of cumulative kinetic energy of rainfall is given below\n(equation 2).\nRRR= RRf \/RRi = * e-k \uf0d6E [2]\nRRR: Random roughness ratio\nRRf : Final soil roughness index (%)\nRRi: Initial soil roughness index (%)\nk : a constant = 0.7 (an average for most soils)\nE : Cumulative kinetic energy of rainfall (kJ m-2)\nMost of the studies relating to surface roughness decay have been tested with rainfall intensities\nless than 100 mm h-1. However, in tropical regions, rainfall intensities well over 100 mm h-1\nnormally occur during the growing season. The question arises if these roughness decay\nequations will still be valid for high intensity rainfall.\nAnother gap in knowledge is the case where surface mulches have been applied. Most of the\nroughness decay equations have focused on bare soil conditions. There arises a doubt whether\nthese equations will be valid for mulched surfaces.\nAs the roughness get broken down, it is believed that there will be an increase in runoff volume\ngenerated from the soil surface thus giving rise to increased sediment losses.\nWhile a lot of studies have focus on breakdown of roughness and at best related this breakdown\nto detention water storage and infiltration, very few studies have focused on the quantitative\nrelations between roughness decay on one hand and soil loss, runoff and sediment concentration\non the other hand. This work attempts to relate the roughness breakdown to soil losses and runoff\nfrom the soil.\nThus objectives of this study are\ni. to test the effectiveness of some already existing equation in predicting roughness\nbreakdown under high intensity rainfall,\nii. to adjust some already existing equation to predict roughness decay under mulched\nsurfaces and\niii. to relate the decay of surface roughness to soil loss runoff and sediment concentration in\nthe runoff.\nMaterials and Methods\nSoil tray of dimensions 0.75 m x 0.5 m and 0.05 m deep and inclined to a slope of five degrees\nwere used for this experiment. A sandy loam soil was collected from the field, air-dried and\npassed through a 10mm sieve. The soil was then brought to gravimetric moisture content of 12%\nbefore being compacted into the soil trays to give a bulk density of 1.4 Mg m-3. The textural\nproperties of the soil used are given in table 1.\nDifferent surface roughness conditions were simulated using a hand trowel. Breaking the soil\ninto large clods simulated a rough surface condition while a fine seed bed condition was\nsimulated by breaking the soil into small clods. For the bare soil condition, 6 soil trays were\nprepared as fine seedbed while another six were prepared for rough seedbed.\nWheat straw was used as the surface mulching material. The rate of mulch application was 3 t\/\nha. The mulch had moisture content of 14.5% at the time of application. To apply the mulch, the\namount required was weighed out and spread uniformly over the soil surface, after the\napplication of tillage treatments\nSurface roughness ratio was measured using a fine chain method proposed by Morgan et al.,\n(1993). The roughness ratio according to Morgan et al., (1993) is defined as the ratio of the\nstraight line distance between two points on the ground to the actual distance measured over all\nthe microtopographic irregularities. This can be expressed equationally as:\n[3]\nR: Roughness index (cm\/m or %).\nY: Straight-line distance between two points on ground surface (m).\nR X Y\nX\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\n.100\nX: The actual distance between the two points measured over all the microtopographic\nirregularities (m).\nThe chain was allowed to conform to the depressions and ridges created by the tillage along the\nmarked axes. Three parallel axes were chosen across the width of the tray and two across the\nlength of the tray. This gave a total of five chain measurements for each roughness\ndetermination. The roughness index was calculated from the mean of these five measurements\nusing equation 3\nMeasurements on the bare soil (unmulched) treatments took place at the following time intervals\n(t): t = 0 (initial condition), t = 3, t = 6, t = 9, t = 12 minutes.\nIn the case of the mulched soil, roughness measurements only took place immediately after the\napplication of the tillage treatment, before applying mulch and at the end of the rainfall\napplication (t = 0 and t = 12). Surface roughness measurements were not taken at intervening\ntimes to prevent the dislodging of the mulch elements. The mulch materials were carefully\nremoved from the soil surface after the last period of rainfall application and the surface\nroughness was measured.\nA pressurized nozzle simulator was used to apply the rainfall. Simulated rainfall with an\nintensity of 50 mm h-1 was initially applied for 30 minutes to bring the soil to saturation. During\nthis period, there was no runoff from the soil. Afterwards, simulated rainfall with an intensity of\n128 mm \/h was applied to the soil for twelve minutes to test the effects of the different\ntreatments.\nFor the bare surface conditions, initial surface roughness was measured immediately after tillage\nand at every 3 minutes interval.\nRunoff from the plot was collected into containers during the storm. After the storm, the runoff\nvolume was estimated using a measuring cylinder. The runoff sample was then allowed to\nsediment after which the water was filtered off leaving the wet soil. The wet soil was\ntransferred into an oven and dried at 110oC for 24 h.\nResults and discussions\nA. Roughness breakdown in bare soil\nThe actual breakdown of surface roughness in this experiment was compared with theoretical\nbreakdown as calculated by equations 1 and 2. There was a significant correlation between the\nactual and predicted roughness for both equations. However, equation 2 gave a higher coefficient\nof determination (R2=0.88) while that of equation 1 was 0.80. Predicted values of roughness\nwere further compared with observed values using t-distribution test to find out if they differ\nstatistically. It was found out that while the predicted values from equation 2 did not differ\nsignificantly from observed values, those from equation 1 were statistically different (Table 2).\nThis indicates that equation 2, which relates the decay of roughness to square root of kinetic\nenergy, has given more accurate predictions of roughness breakdown. This confirms the work of\nSaleh (1994) in which rainfall erosivity index (EI) was a better predictor of random roughness\nthan the rainfall amount. Since equation 1 was developed mostly in the United States, the\nparameter constants, particularly the exponential decay parameter, may be a reflection of local\nconditions. If equation 1 is adjusted, the constant of the exponent in this equation changes from\n0.026 to 0.199 to fit the data generated from this study. There is need to test equation 1 under\ndifferent climatic and field condition to investigate how these parameters may be adjusted to\npredict the decay of roughness.\nB. Roughness breakdown under the mulch\nAs expected, the decay of surface roughness under a mulch cover was far less than when the soil\nwas bare. This was due to the dissipation of kinetic energy of rainfall by the mulch.\nConsequently, surface roughness was preserved longer under the mulch cover. Neither equation\n1 or 2 gave reasonable predictions of the decay of roughness under surface applied mulch. Using\na non-linear regression method on the roughness data generated in the laboratory, the constants\nof equations 1 & 2 for the surface mulched condition were found (equation 3 & 4).\nRRf = RRi *0.89 * e -0.002 P [4]\nRRf = RRi * e-0.21 *\uf0d6E [5]\nRRf: Final soil roughness (cm)\nRRi: Initial soil roughness (cm)\nP: cumulative rainfall (cm)\nE: Kinetic energy of rainfall (kJ m-2)\nFrom equation 3, it can be seen that the constant attached to the exponent, which was 0.026 in\nequation 1 has reduced to 0.002. Similarly the k - factor in equation 2 has been reduced from 0.7\nto 0.2 in equation 4. This reflects the slowing down of the decay of surface roughness due to the\nmulching.\nC. Predicting soil loss, runoff and sediment concentration from surface roughness.\nA series of bivariate and multiple regression were performed to find out if soil loss, runoff and\nsediment concentrations from bare soil condition could be predicted from roughness values. A\ntotal of 24 data points were used to generate various regression equations given on Table 2.\nThough the regression equations expressing soil loss, runoff or sediment concentration as a\nfunction of initial roughness were significant (Tab.2, equations 6-8), the coefficients of\ndetermination (R2) were however low. Initial roughness explained just 39% of the variation in\nthe measured soil loss, 12% in runoff and 36% in the sediment concentration. These relatively\nlow R2 implies that there are other significant variables apart from initial roughness controlling\nthese dependent variables. As has been shown earlier, the decay of roughness is closely related to\nthe cumulative kinetic energy of rainfall, thus, this variable was included in the regression. The\nregression equations now became a function of two independent variables, namely initial surface\nroughness and cumulative kinetic energy. The equations generated are listed in table2 equations\n9-11. The regression between soil loss and the two independent variables gave a very high R2\n(0.81). For the runoff, the R2 was 0.74. However for the sediment concentration, the R2 was\nrelatively low being 0.49. This shows that soil loss and runoff from a bare soil can be reliably\npredicted, if the initial roughness and the cumulative kinetic energy is known.\nAdding final surface roughness to the independent variable (Table 2, equations 12-14) further\nexpanded the regression equation. This led to an improvement in the predictive ability of the\nequation. The R2 with soil loss as the dependent variable was 0.87, while for runoff and sediment\nconcentration, it was 0.85 and 0.51 respectively. This shows that with the knowledge of these\nthree variables (initial roughness, final roughness and cumulative kinetic energy), soil loss and\nrunoff from a bare soil can be estimated. It is worth noting that final roughness can be reliably\npredicted using equation 2, therefore, only the values of initial roughness and cumulative kinetic\nenergy are needed to use equations 12-14 on table 2.\nAlthough these regression equations have been generated from a laboratory study with relatively\nfew data points, thereby limiting it scope of application, however it gives an important focus on\nhow soil loss and runoff may be predicted using roughness indices and kinetic energy of rainfall.\nThere is need to test this empirical approach using field-measured values under different climatic\nzones.\nConclusions:\nThe decay of surface roughness was studied and related to soil loss, runoff and sediment\nconcentration. The study led to the following conclusions:\n1. The decay of surface roughness measured in this experiment was better predicted by an\nexponent function of the square root of cumulative kinetic energy of rainfall rather than\ncumulative rainfall.\n2. The decay of surface roughness under mulch was not well predicted by equations being used\nfor decay under bare soil surfaces. Thus the exponent parameters of the decay equations were\nadjusted based on measured values to reflect the slowing of roughness breakdown under\nmulched surfaces\n3. Regression equations relating soil loss, runoff or sediment concentration to initial roughness\ngave low coefficient of determination, which were 0.39, 0.12, 0.36 respectively. This indicates\nthat such equations could not reliably predict these dependent variables.\n4. Regression equations relating soil loss, runoff or sediment concentration to initial roughness\nand cumulative kinetic energy gave high R2 for soil loss (0.81) and runoff (0.74) but a relatively\nlow R2 for sediment concentration (0.49). This shows that runoff and soil loss can be reliably\nestimated from initial roughness and cumulative kinetic energy.\n5. Regression equations using three independent variables: initial roughness, final roughness and\ncumulative kinetic energy gave a significant regression with soil loss, runoff and sediment\nconcentration. The R2 of soil loss (0.87) and runoff (0.85) were very high showing that the\naddition of final roughness to the independent variables has improved the predictive ability of the\nequation for soil loss and runoff. However there was not much improvement in the prediction of\nsediment concentration, having an R2 of just 0.51\n6. There is need to test out this empirical approach to soil loss and runoff predictions under field\ncondition with natural rainfall.\nAcknowledgment:\nSpecial thanks to Alex Vickers for assisting in setting up of rainfall simulators and collection of\nsoil samples.\nReferences:\nBurwell RE, Allmaras RR, Amemiya M. 1963.
