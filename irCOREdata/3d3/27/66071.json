Thus, for\nmany years, it has been possible to cool one species of ion\nsympathetically, by placing it in contact with another\nspecies that is being actively cooled [1,2]. More recently,\nultracold neutral atoms have also been sympathetically\ncooled [3]. At slightly higher temperatures, atoms and\nmolecules have been sympathetically cooled in a helium\nbuffer gas [4]. Molecules are widely regarded as worth\ncooling to ultralow temperatures (typically around 1 \u0001K),\nwhere de Broglie wavelengths become large, and intermo-\nlecular interactions are dominated by long-range forces.\nUnder such circumstances, the possibility of permanent\nelectric dipole moments is expected to lead to novelties\nin such areas as precision measurement, collisions and\nchemistry, quantum degenerate matter, and quantum infor-\nmation theory [5].\nA host of molecular cooling techniques have been pro-\nposed [5], but two that stand out are buffer-gas cooling\n(BGC), in which the cold He gas cools the molecules, and\nStark deceleration (SD), in which polar molecules are\nslowed by carefully designed time-varying electric fields\n[6]. These techniques tend to produce \u2018\u2018lukewarm\u2019\u2019 gases,\nwith translational temperatures in the 10\u2013100 mK range.\nThey are therefore somewhat at a disadvantage with re-\nspect to the direct production of molecules by photoasso-\nciation from a gas of ultracold atoms [7]. Nevertheless,\nBGC and SD are extremely appealing for the far greater\nvariety of molecular species that they can cool.\nIn this Letter we are concerned with the possibility of\nturning a 10 mK gas of molecules into a 10 \u0001K gas, by\nsympathetically cooling with Rb. For this cooling to be\neffective, the cross sections must be favorable. Namely,\nelastic scattering should occur frequently (with large cross\nsections \u0002el), to make the necessary thermal contact. On\nthe other hand, inelastic collisions that change the state of\nthe molecules should occur infrequently (with small cross\nsections \u0002inel). This is because either magnetostatic or\nelectrostatic trapping demands that the molecules remain\nin a well-defined internal state. Until now, cross sections\nfor m-level-changing cold collisions of alkali atoms with\nmolecules were wholly unknown. In this Letter we present\nthe first such collision results, using a set of complete\nab initio potential energy surfaces (PESs), and incorporat-\ning the hyperfine structure of the collision partners.\nOur prototype system for this study consists of OH\nmolecules in a bath of Rb atoms. This is a particularly\ntimely example: the OH radical has been successfully\nslowed by Stark deceleration techniques in at least two\nlaboratories, which can now produce \u000210 mK packets of\nthese molecules on demand [6,8]. At the same time, Rb is\neasily cooled and trapped in copious quantities at tens or\nhundreds of \u0001K, making it an ideal target for the mole-\ncules. In addition, the Rb-OH collision system is subject to\na \u2018\u2018harpooning\u2019\u2019 process, similar to that in Rb-NH [9],\nwhere during a collision the valence electron jumps from\nRb to OH [10]. This process is without precedent in the\ncold collisions literature. Thus, even apart from sympa-\nthetic cooling, the Rb-OH scattering system is quite rich\nfrom a cold collisions perspective.\nWe begin by describing the potential energy surfaces\n(PES\u2019s) of the system, as functions of (R, \u0003), where R is the\ndistance between the atom and diatom, and \u0003 is the angle\nthat the Jacobi vector ~R makes with the OH axis. The OH\nmonomer has a 2\u0001 ground state arising from a \u00043 con-\nfiguration, while the ground state of Rb is 2S. This pro-\nduces 1\u0001 and 3\u0001 states for linear RbOH, which split into\n1A0, 1A00 and 3A0, 3A00 surfaces at nonlinear geometries. We\nwill refer to these as the covalent states. In addition, RbOH\nhas an ion-pair state analogous to the ones previously\nfound for RbNH [9]. The ion-pair threshold for Rb\u0003 \u00041S\u0005 \u0003\nOH\u0001 (1\u0002\u0003) lies only 2.35 eV above the ground state at\nR \u0006 1 and produces a 1\u0002\u0003 (1A0) state that cuts steeply\ndown, crossing the covalent states near 6 A\u02da . This is an\nactual crossing at linear geometries, where the ion-pair\nand covalent states have different symmetries, but there\nare avoided crossings between the two states of 1A0 sym-\nmetry at nonlinear geometries. There is therefore a conical\nintersection between the two 1A0 surfaces at linear\ngeometries.\nPRL 97, 183201 (2006) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending3 NOVEMBER 2006\n0031-9007=06=97(18)=183201(4) 183201-1 \u00a9 2006 The American Physical Society\nPotential energy surfaces for all 5 electronic states of\nRbOH were calculated by complete active space self-\nconsistent field (CASSCF) calculations followed by multi-\nreference configuration interaction (MRCI). A full descrip-\ntion will be given elsewhere [11]. All calculations used the\nMOLPRO package [12], with aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets [13] in\nuncontracted form for O and H and the ECP28MWB\nsmall-core quasirelativistic effective core potential [14]\nfor Rb, with the valence basis set from Ref. [15]. The\nCASSCF calculation included all configurations that can\nbe formed from the lowest \u000410; 3\u0005 orbitals of (a0, a00)\nsymmetry, with the lowest \u00045; 1\u0005 orbitals doubly occupied.\nEnergies were calculated in Jacobi coordinates (R, \u0003) on a\ngrid of 25 unequally spaced points in R from 2 to 12 A\u02da and\n11 Gauss-Lobatto quadrature points in \u0003. The two 1A0\nsurfaces were transformed to obtain two quasidiabatic\ndiagonal surfaces and a coupling surface, using a mixing\nangle derived from matrix elements of the OH L^z operator.\nFinally, the quasidiabatic covalent energies were extrapo-\nlated to R \u0006 1 using C6 and C7 coefficients obtained from\ncoupled cluster (CCSD) calculations at R \u0006 15, 25, and\n100 A\u02da . The singlet and triplet sum and difference surfaces\nwere expanded in normalized associated Legendre func-\ntions and the radial coefficients were interpolated using the\nreciprocal-power reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RP-\nRKHS) method [16,17].\nThe resulting diabatic covalent surfaces have wells 337\nand 511 cm\u00011 deep at linear Rb-OH geometries for the\nsinglet and triplet surfaces, respectively. For the A0 surfaces\nthis linear well is the absolute minimum, but the A00 sur-\nfaces have absolute minima at nonlinear geometries (\u0003 \u0007\n125\b) with depths of 405 and 615 cm\u00011, respectively.\nThe ion-pair state is very much deeper, with a well\n\u000226 000 cm\u00011 below the neutral threshold.\nTo perform scattering calculations on these surfaces, we\nexpand the wave function into an appropriate basis set\nconsisting of the quantum numbers of the atom and diatom\nin the separated limit. For the atom, electronic (sa) and\nnuclear (ia) spins are coupled to make total spin jfamfai in\nthe lab frame. For the diatom, the electronic wave function\nis specified in Hund\u2019s coupling case (a) by the total elec-\ntronic angular momentum j, with projections mj in the lab\nframe and ! in the frame rotating with the molecule. As\nusual, ! is separated into its orbital and spin compo-\nnents, ! \u0006 \u0005\u0003 \u0002. Linear combinations j \u0003\u0005 \u0003!\u0006i\u0006 \u0004j\u0005!i\u0003\n\u0006j\u0001\u0005\u0001!i\u0005= \u0001\u0001\u00012p are constructed to produce states of good\nparity appropriate to the zero-electric-field case we con-\nsider here. Finally, j is coupled to the nuclear spin id of the\nhydrogen atom to yield total diatom spin jfdmfdi. The\npartial wave quantum numbers jLMLi account for the\nrelative orientation of the collision pair in the lab frame.\nThus the basis states of our calculation are given by\n jsd \u0003\u0005 \u0003!\u0006\u0004jid\u0005fdmfdij\u0004saia\u0005famfaijLMLi: (1)\nIn this basis the total parity p \u0006 \u0006\u0004\u00011\u0005j\u0001sd\u0003L and the lab\nprojection of total angular momentum, mfd \u0003mfa \u0003ML,\nare conserved quantities. In zero field, the total angular\nmomentum F \u0006 fd \u0003 fa \u0003L would also be conserved;\nhowever, we anticipate considering the action of a field on\nthe collisions, which would mix different F values. We\ntherefore do not exploit this symmetry here.\nCast in this basis, the Schro\u00a8dinger equation for Rb-OH\ncollisions takes the standard form of a set of close-coupled\nequations in the variable R. To solve these, we propagate\nthe log-derivative matrix Y \t d =dR \u00011 using a variable-\nstep version of Johnson\u2019s algorithm [18]. Because of the\nmultiple PESs and the inclusion of hyperfine degrees of\nfreedom, the total number of scattering channels required\nto solve the complete problem including spin (in excess of\n25 000) is prohibitively large.\nTo overcome this obstacle, we exploit a kind of frame-\ntransformation procedure [19]. We identify a suitable ra-\ndius R \u0006 R0, and define R< R0 and R> R0 as the \u2018\u2018short-\nrange\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018long-range\u2019\u2019 parts of the calculation, respec-\ntively. For Rb-OH, we choose R0 \u0006 17a0. In the short-\nrange region, the PES\u2019s are deep, and the hyperfine effects\nare small. We therefore compute Y in a basis of decoupled\nnuclear spins and neglect couplings between blocks of the\nHamiltonian with different nuclear spin projections mia or\nmid . In this pilot study, we have neglected the influence of\nthe ion-pair channel.\nAt long range, R> R0, the full hyperfine structure is\nrestored, and Y is transformed into the basis (1) for further\npropagation and matching to spherical Bessel functions to\nyield scattering matrices. In this region, collision channels\nin which the molecule is excited into higher-lying rota-\ntional or spin-orbit states are already strongly closed. We\ntherefore eliminate these channels. In the inner region, we\nuse partial waves up to L \u0006 28 and rotational states up to\nj \u0006 11=2. In the outer region, we employ partial waves up\nto L \u0006 22, but with full hyperfine structure of the j \u0006 3=2\nrotational ground state. Because of these approximations,\nno single calculation requires more than 2000 channels\n[11]. Numerical checks suggest that the magnitudes of\ncross sections computed in this way are accurate to within\na factor of \u00022.\nFor concreteness, we calculate cross sections for a beam\nexperiment in which the incident wave vector is coincident\nwith the laboratory quantization axis. Energy-dependent\ncross sections for two different initial states of the collision\npartners are shown in Fig. 1. In the first case, Fig. 1(a), the\nRb atom is initially in its \u2018\u2018stretched\u2019\u2019 state, with jfamfai \u0006\nj22i, and the molecule is in its higher-lying, f parity state,\nand also spin stretched, with jfdmfdi \u0006 j22i. Both these\nstates are weak-magnetic-field seeking, meaning that they\ncan be trapped magnetically. In addition, OH in this state\ncan be trapped electrostatically. Solid lines denote elastic\ncross sections \u0002el, in which all internal quantum numbers\nare retained after the collision, and dashed lines refer to\ninelastic cross sections \u0002inel, which represents the sum of\nstate-to-state cross sections to many possible outcomes\ndistinct from the initial channel (including mfa and\nPRL 97, 183201 (2006) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending3 NOVEMBER 2006\n183201-2\nmj-changing collisions that do not release energy at zero\nfield).\nThe results in Fig. 1 clearly demonstrate that \u0002inel is\noften equal to, or greater than, \u0002el over much of the energy\nrange. That this should be so can be seen qualitatively by\nconsidering the flow of angular momentum during a colli-\nsion. The total angular momentum projection MF \u0006\nmfa \u0003mfd \u0003ML is conserved, where mfd \u0006 mj \u0003mid \u0006\nmn \u0003msd \u0003mid contains the spin-independent projection\nmn. In the absence of anisotropy in the potential energy\nsurface, mn and ML would be separately conserved, and\ntherefore mfa and mfd would be conserved in stretched\nstates. However, the anisotropy allows mn to change read-\nily, hence changing the overall projection of the diatom\u2019s\nangular momentum. Moreover, the fact that OH is a Hund\u2019s\ncase (a) molecule means that mn and msd are not separate\nentities so that the electronic spin projection is also\nchanged in a collision. The general view is one of a\ncomplete \u2018\u2018scrambling\u2019\u2019 of the internal degrees of freedom\nof the OH molecule upon colliding with Rb; this picture is\nsubstantiated by partial cross sections, which show signifi-\ncant scattering into all channels that are allowed by energy\nand angular momentum conservation [11].\nAt low energies, the cross sections in Fig. 1(a) vary in\naccordance with the Wigner law, with \u0002el constant at\nthreshold, and \u0002inel \/ 1=\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\nE\np\n. At higher energies, the in-\nelastic cross section can be roughly estimated by exploiting\nthe idea that the internal state of the molecule is completely\ndisrupted during a collision. Such a process can be ap-\nproximated simply by a Langevin model [10]: for a given\nenergy E, there is a maximum partial wave L\u0004E\u0005 for which\nE lies above the centrifugal barrier of the long-range\npotential \u0001C6=R6 \u0003 @2L\u0004L\u0003 1\u0005=2\u0001R2. Here C6 \u0006\n325Eha\n6\n0 is the isotropic van der Waals coefficient of the\nPES [11], and \u0001 the reduced mass of the collision pair. In\nthe Langevin model, we assume that any partial wave\nsmaller than L\u0004E\u0005 contributes to inelastic scattering with\nunit probability, i.e., any time the atom and molecule are\nnear one another, their internal states are always disrupted.\nThis idea leads to a cross section\n \u0002Langevin\u0004E\u0005 \u0006 3\u0004\n\u0002\nC6\n4E\n\u0003\n1=3\n: (2)\nThis cross section is also shown in Fig. 1(a), by the solid\nsymbols. It is clearly getting the trend and the order of\nmagnitude of the cross sections correct.\nIn this pilot calculation, we have not included the effect\nof the ion-pair channel. However, in light of the near-\ncomplete disruption of molecular state already included\nin the model, including the ion-pair channels would likely\nonly disrupt the internal states more severely, and would\nnot change this basic conclusion about sympathetic cool-\ning. Preliminary calculations have indeed found this to be\nthe case [11]. Note that our cross sections are already larger\nthan the geometric cross section \u0002 \u0006 4\u0004R20 \u0006 4:5\n\n10\u000114 cm2 for a crossing radius R0 \u0006 6 \u0004A.\nWe turn now to an alternative pair of initial states, whose\nscattering cross sections are shown in Fig. 1(b). Here the\natom is in its lowest magnetically trappable state, with\njfamfai \u0006 j1\u0001 1i, and the molecule is in its lower-energy\ne state, with total spin jfdmfdi \u0006 j11i (also magnetically\ntrappable). At zero field, both \u0002el and \u0002inel are energy-\nindependent at low energies, since all exit channels are\nisoenergetic with the incident channel. In nonzero field, the\nj11iOHj1\u0001 1iRb channel lies above other m components in\nenergy, and \u0002inel would again diverge.\nBy the same token, sympathetic cooling is possible at\nlow energies for OH molecules in the j1\u0001 1i state and Rb\natoms in the j11i state. This is the lowest-energy channel of\nall: there are no inelastic channels energetically available\nand \u0002inel will vanish. These states are not magnetically\nFIG. 1 (color online). Rb-OH collision cross sections vs en-\nergy. Solid (dashed) lines represent elastic (inelastic) cross\nsections. In (a) results are shown for the incident channel\nj2\u00013=2; fdmfd \u0006 22; fiOH jfamfa \u0006 22iRb, where both the\natom and diatom are weak-magnetic-field seeking, and the OH\nis also weak-electric-field seeking. In (b) the incident channel is\nshown j2\u00013=2; fdmfd \u0006 11; eiOH jfamfa \u0006 1\u0001 1iRb. Again,\nboth species are in weak-magnetic-field seeking states, but the\nOH is now in a strong-electric-field seeking state. The points\nindicate the Langevin cross section, Eq. (2).\nPRL 97, 183201 (2006) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending3 NOVEMBER 2006\n183201-3\ntrappable, but could be confined in an optical or microwave\n[20] dipole trap or an alternating current trap [21]. A small\nstatic magnetic field will be needed to maintain the pro-\njection quantum numbers.\nAt higher collision energies, other forms of inelastic\nscattering become energetically allowed. Once the colli-\nsion energy surpasses the height of the p-wave centrifugal\nbarrier (at about 1.6 mK), the molecule can shed angular\nmomentum into the partial wave degree of freedom. At this\npoint \u0002inel climbs to a large value, comparable to \u0002el.\nFurther, at about 4 mK, the f \u0006 2 hyperfine state of OH\nbecomes energetically allowed, providing another route to\ninelastic collisions. By examining the partial cross sec-\ntions, we find that these two avenues for inelastic collisions\nare roughly equally likely. At still higher collision ener-\ngies, \u0002inel is again roughly approximated by the Langevin\nresult (2), although there is now more structure, owing to a\nlarge number of Feshbach resonances to fine and hyperfine\nexcited states.\nThese results present a cautionary tale for sympathetic\ncooling using alkali atoms. One may regard inelastic scat-\ntering as a \u2018\u2018Murphy\u2019s Law\u2019\u2019 process [22]. Namely, if the\ninternal state of the molecule can change to produce an\nunfavorable result, it will do so. The key to making sym-\npathetic cooling viable lies in eliminating undesirable\nchannels as far as possible. For example, a light collision\npartner with a small C6 coefficient will produce a centrifu-\ngal barrier at higher energy, preventing partial waves from\naccepting angular momentum. This circumstance explains,\nat least partly, the ability of a He buffer gas to cool\nmolecules without badly disrupting spin orientation [23\u2013\n25]. In the present context of alkali atoms, consider Li,\nwhich is about 12 times lighter than Rb, and about half as\npolarizable. Its p-wave centrifugal barrier upon colliding\nwith OH is on the order of 10 mK. In addition, a molecule\nthat is better described by Hund\u2019s coupling case (b), in\nwhich the electron\u2019s spin is only weakly coupled to the\nmolecular rotation axis, may help weaken \u0002inel below the\nLangevin limit [25].\nIn summary, we have performed the first ab initio scat-\ntering calculations for an open-shell, ground state molecule\ncolliding with an alkali atom, incorporating the hyperfine\nstructure of both collision partners. The results suggest that\nelastic cross sections are sufficiently large for sympathetic\ncooling to occur, yet equally large inelastic cross sections\nprobably hinder this application. Nonetheless, the results\ndo not preclude the possibility that, by applying electric or\nmagnetic fields, inelastic cross sections could be sup-\npressed [26,27]. This will be the subject of a future study.\nM. L. and J. L. B. gratefully acknowledge the NSF and\nthe W. M. Keck Foundation. P.
