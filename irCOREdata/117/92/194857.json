This pro-\nposal was evaluated and accepted by ESO\u2019s Survey Working\nGroup (SWG) and turned into a proposal for an ESO large pro-\ngram submitted to the ESO OPC1.\nThe XMM-Newton optical follow-up survey aims at ob-\ntaining optical observations of XMM-Newton Serendipitous\nSky Survey fields, publicly available in the XMM-Newton\narchive, using the wide-field imager (WFI) at the ESO\/MPG\n2.2 m telescope at the La Silla Observatory. WFI has a FOV\nwhich is an excellent match to that of the X-ray detectors on-\nboard the XMM-Newton satellite, making this instrument an\nobvious choice for this survey in the South. A complemen-\ntary multiband optical imaging program (to median 5\u03c3 limiting\nmagnitudes reaching i\u2032 = 23.1) for over 150 XMM-Newton\nfields is nearing completion in the North using the similarly\nwell matched Wide Field Camera on the 2.5 m Isaac Newton\nTelescope (Yuan et al. 2003; Watson et al. 2003). In order to\nprovide data for minimum spectral discrimination and photo-\nmetric redshift estimates of the optical counterparts of previ-\nously detected X-ray sources, the survey has been carried out\nin the B-, V-, R-, and I-passbands. The survey has been admin-\nistered and carried out by the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS) team.\nThis paper describes observations, reduction, and science\nverification of data publicly released as part of this follow-\nup survey. Section 2 briefly describes the X-ray observations\nwhile Sect. 3 focus on the optical imaging. In Sect. 4 the re-\nduction and calibration of optical data are presented and the\nresults discussed. Final survey products such as stacked im-\nages and science-grade catalogs extracted from them are pre-\nsented in Sect. 5. The quality of these products is evaluated in\nSect. 6 by comparing statistical measures obtained from these\ndata to those of other authors as well as from a direct compar-\nison with the results of an independent reduction of the same\ndataset. In this section the results of a preliminary assessment\nof X-ray\/optical cross-correlation are also discussed. Finally, in\nSect. 7 a brief summary of the paper is presented.\n1 The full text of the large program proposal is available at\nhttp:\/\/www.eso.org\/science\/eis\/documents\/\nEIS.2002-09-04T12:42:31.890.ps.gz\n2. X-ray observations\nThe original proposal by the SWG to the ESO OPC was\nto cover a total area of approximately 10 square degrees\n(40 fields) to a limiting magnitude of 25 (AB, 5\u03c3, 2 \u2032\u2032 aperture).\nThe OPC approved enough time to observe 12 fields, later ex-\ntending the time allocation to include 3 more fields. This paper\npresents results for the original 12 fields for which the optical\ndata were originally publicly released in the fall of 2004, with\ncorrections to the weight maps released in July 2005. Table 1\ngives the location of the 12 fields listing: in Col. 1 the field\nname; in Col. 2 the original XMM-Newton target name; in\nCols. 3 and 4 the right ascension and declination in J2000; and\nin Cols. 5 and 6 the galactic coordinates, l and b.\nThe 12 fields listed in Table 1 were selected and prioritized\nby a collaboration of interested parties from the SSC, a group\nat the Institut f\u00fcr Astrophysik und Extraterrestrische Forschung\n(IAEF) of the University of Bonn, and an appointed committee\nof the SWG. These fields were selected following, as much as\npossible, the criteria given in the proposal, namely that: (1) the\nfields had to have a large effective exposure time in X-ray (ide-\nally texp > 30 ks) with no enhanced background; (2) the X-ray\ndata of the selected fields had to be public by the time the\nraw WFI frames were to become public; (3) the original tar-\ngets should not be too bright and\/or extended, thus allowing\na number of other X-ray sources to be detected away from the\nprimary target; and (4) \u223c70% of the fields had to be located at\nhigh-galactic latitude. Comments on the individual fields can\nbe found in Appendix A.\nCombined EPIC X-ray images for the fields listed in\nTable 1 were created from exposures taken with the three cam-\neras (PN, MOS1, MOS2) on-board XMM-Newton. The sen-\nsitive area of these cameras is a circle with a diameter of\napproximately 30\u2032. The contributing X-ray observations are\nsummarized in Table 2 which gives for each field: in Col. 1\nthe field identification; in Col. 2 the XMM-Newton observa-\ntion id; in Col. 3 the nominal exposure time; in Cols. 4\u20136 the\nsettings for each of the cameras. Here (E)FF indicates (ex-\ntended) full frame readout, LW large window mode and SW2\nsmall window mode. These cameras and their settings are de-\nscribed in detail in Ehle et al. (2004).

These data were used to create a wide range of prod-\nucts which include:\n\u2013 combined EPIC images in the XID-band 0.5\u20134.5 keV\n(FITS);\n\u2013 combined EPIC images in the total band 0.1\u201312 keV\n(FITS);\n\u2013 color images using three sub-bands, 0.5\u20131.0 keV (red),\n1.0\u20132.0 keV (green), 2.0\u20134.5 keV (blue), in the XID-band\n(JPG).\nAs an illustration, Fig. 1 shows color composites of the fi-\nnal combined X-ray images for the 12 fields considered. Note\nthat the X-ray images have a non-uniform exposure time over\nthe field of view due to (1) the arrangements of the CCDs\nin the focal plane, which is different for the three cameras;\nand (2) the vignetting of the camera optics.\n2 http:\/\/xmm.vilspa.esa.es\/external\/xmm_data_acc\/\nxsa\/index.shtml\n3. Optical observations\nAs mentioned earlier, the optical observations were carried out\nusing WFI at the ESO\/MPG-2.2 m telescope in service mode.\nWFI is a focal reducer-type mosaic camera mounted at the\nCassegrain focus of the telescope. The mosaic consists of 4 \u00d7\n2 CCD chips with 2048 \u00d7 4096 pixels with a projected pixel\nsize of 0.\u2032\u2032238, giving a FOV of 8.\u203212\u00d7 16.\u203225 for each individual\nchip. The chips are separated by gaps of 23.\u2032\u20328 and 14.\u2032\u20323 along\nthe right ascension and declination direction, respectively. The\nfull FOV of WFI is thus 34\u2032 \u00d7 33\u2032 with a filling factor of 95.9%.\nThe WFI data described in this paper are from the following\ntwo sources:\n1. the ESO Large Programme 170.A-0789(A) (Principal In-\nvestigator: J. Krautter, as chair of the SWG) which has ac-\ncumulated data from January 27, 2003 to March 24, 2004\nat the time of writing;\n2. the contributing programs 70.A-0529(A); 71.A-0110(A);\n71.A-0110(B) with P. Schneider as the Principal Invest-\nigator, which have contributed data from October 14, 2002\nto September 29, 2003.\nObservations were performed in the B-, V-, R-, and\nI-passbands. These were split into OBs consisting of a\n840 J. P. Dietrich et al.: ESO imaging survey: optical follow-up of 12 selected XMM-Newton fields\nTable 3.

The table gives: in\nCol. 1 the passband; in Col. 2 the filter id adopting the unique\nnaming convention of the La Silla Science Operations Team; in\nCol. 3 the total exposure time in seconds; in Col. 4 the number\nof observing blocks (OBs) per field; and in Col. 5 the integra-\ntion time of the individual sub-exposures in the OB. The dither\npattern with a radius of 80\u2032\u2032 was optimized for the best filling\nof the gaps. Filter curves can be found in Arnouts et al. (2001)\nand on the web page of the La Silla Science Operations Team 3.\nEven though the nominal total survey exposure time for\nthe R-band is 3500 s, the data contributed by the Bonn group\nprovided additional exposures totaling 11 500 s each, spread\nover 4 OBs. For the same reason the B-band data for the\nfield XMM-07 has a significantly larger exposure time than that\ngiven in Table 3 (see Table 9).\nService mode observing provides the option for constraints\non e.g., seeing, transparency, and airmass to be specified in or-\nder to meet the requirements of the survey. The adopted con-\nstraints were: (1) dark sky with a fractional lunar illumination\nof less than 0.4; (2) clear sky with no cirrus though not neces-\nsarily photometric; and (3) seeing \u22641.\u2032\u20322. The R-band images of\nthe contributing program were taken with a seeing constraint\nof <\u223c1.\u2032\u20320 so that the data can be used for weak lensing studies.\nThe total integration time in some fields may be higher than\nthe nominal one listed in Table 3 because unexpected variations\nin ambient conditions during the execution of an OB can cause,\nfor instance, the seeing and transparency to exceed the origi-\nnally imposed constraints. If this happens, the OB is normally\nexecuted again at a later time. In these cases the decision of us-\ning or not all the available data must be taken during the data\nreduction process. In the case of the present survey all avail-\nable data were included in the reduction, which explains why\nin some cases the total integration time exceeds that originally\nplanned.\nThis paper describes data accumulated prior to October 16,\n2003, amounting to about 80 h on-target integration. The\nscience data comprises 720 exposures split into 130 OBs.\nAbout 15% of the B-band and 85% of the R-band data are from\nthe contributing programs.\n4. Data reduction\nThe accumulated optical exposures were reduced and cali-\nbrated using the EIS Data Reduction System (da Costa et al.,\nin preparation) and its associated image processing engine\n3 http:\/\/www.ls.eso.org\/lasilla\/sciops\/2p2\/E2p2M\/\nWFI\/filters\/\nbased on the C++ EIS\/MVM library routines (Vandame 2004;\nVandame et al., in preparation)4. This library incorporates rou-\ntines from the multi-resolution visual model package (MVM)\ndescribed in Bijaoui & Ru\u00e9 (1995) and Ru\u00e9 & Bijaoui (1997). It\nwas developed by the EIS project to enable handling and reduc-\ning, using a single environment, the different observing strate-\ngies and the variety of single\/multi-chip, optical\/infrared cam-\neras used by the different surveys carried out by the EIS team.\nThe platform independent EIS\/MVM image processing en-\ngine is publicly available and can be retrieved from the EIS\nweb-pages5.\nThe system automatically recognizes calibration and sci-\nence exposures and treats them accordingly. For the reduction,\nframes are associated and grouped into Reduction Blocks (RBs)\nbased on the frame type, spatial separation and time interval\nbetween consecutive frames. The end point of the reduction\nof an RB is a reduced image and an associated weight map\ndescribing the local variations of noise and exposure time in\nthe reduced image. The data reduction algorithms are fully de-\nscribed in Vandame (2004).\nIn order to produce a reduced image, the individual expo-\nsures within an RB are: (1) normalized to 1 s integration; (2) as-\ntrometrically calibrated with the Guide Star Catalog version 2.2\n(GSC-2.2) as reference catalog, using a second-order polyno-\nmial distortion model; (3) warped into a user-defined refer-\nence grid (pixel, projection and orientation), using a third-order\nLanczos kernel; and (4) co-added only using the weight for dis-\ncarding the flux contribution from masked pixels (e.g. satellite\ntracks automatically detected and masked using a Hough trans-\nformation), for which the pixel value is zero. Note that individ-\nual exposures in the RB are not scaled to the same flux level.\nThis assumes that the time interval corresponding to an RB is\nsmall enough to neglect significant changes in airmass.\nThe 720 raw exposures were converted into 160 fully\ncalibrated reduced images, of which 146 were released in\nthe B- (36), V- (32), R- (43) and I- (35) passbands. Of the\nremaining 14, 10 were observed with wrong coordinates,\nthree (XMM-05 (R), XMM-06 (I), XMM-12 (V)) were rejected\nafter visual inspection and one (XMM-12) was discarded due\nto a very short integration time (73 s), associated to a failed OB.\nThe number of reduced images (150) exceeds that of OBs (130)\nbecause the RBs were built by splitting the OBs in order to\nimprove the cosmetic quality of the final stacked images, as\ndiscussed below.\nThe photometric calibration of the reduced images was ob-\ntained using the photometric pipeline integrated to the EIS data\nreduction system as described in more detail in Appendix B. In\nparticular, the XMM-Newton survey data presented here were\nobtained in 41 different nights of which 37 included observa-\ntions of standard star fields. For these 37 nights it was attempted\nto obtain photometric solutions. The four nights without stan-\ndard star observations are: February 2, 3 and 4, 2003 (Public\nSurvey); and November 8, 2002 (contributing program).

For three nights (March 26, 2003; April 2, 2003;\nAugust 6, 2003) the solutions obtained in the passbands V, I,\nR, respectively (either 2- or 3-parameter fits) deviate from the\nmedian by \u22120.26, \u22120.5, \u22120.25 mag. Of those, only the I-band\nzeropoint obtained for April 2, 2003 deviates by more than 3\u03c3\nfrom the solutions obtained for other nights. Note that the type\nof solution obtained depends on the available airmass and color\ncoverage, which in the case of the XMM-Newton survey de-\npends on the calibration plan adopted by the La Silla Science\nOperations Team.\nBecause the EIS Survey System automatically carries out\nthe photometric calibrations it is interesting to compare the so-\nlutions to those obtained by other means. Therefore, the auto-\nmatically computed 3-parameter solutions of the EIS Survey\nSystem are compared with the best solution recently obtained\nby the La Silla Science Operations Team. The results of this\ncomparison are presented in Table 5 which lists: in Col. 1 the\npassband; in Cols. 2\u20134 the mean offsets in zeropoint (ZP), ex-\ntinction (k) and color term (color), respectively. The agreement\nof the solutions is excellent for all passbands. However, it is\nworth emphasizing that the periods of observations of standard\nstars available to the two teams do not coincide.\nNot surprisingly, larger offsets are found when 2- and\n1-parameter fits are included, depending on the passband and\nestimator used to derive the estimates for extinction and color\nterm. Finally, taking into consideration only 3-parameter fit so-\nlutions and after rejecting 3\u03c3 outliers one finds that the scatter\nof the zeropoints is <\u223c0.08 mag. This number is still uncertain\ngiven the small number of 3-parameter fits currently available,\nespecially in the R-band. The obtained scatter is a reasonable\nestimate for the current accuracy of the absolute photometric\ncalibration of the XMM-Newton survey data.\nThere are two more points that should be considered in\nevaluating the accuracy of the photometric calibration of the\npresent data. First, for detectors consisting of a mosaic of in-\ndividual CCDs it is important to estimate and correct for pos-\nsible chip-to-chip variations of the gain. For the present data\nthese variations were estimated by comparing the median back-\nground values of sub-regions bordering adjacent CCDs. The\ndetermined variations were used to bring the gain to a com-\nmon value for all CCDs in the mosaic. This was applied to\nboth science and standard exposures. Second, it is also known\nthat large-scale variations due to non-uniform illumination over\nthe field of view of a wide-field camera exist. The signifi-\ncance of this effect is passband-dependent and becomes more\npronounced with increasing distance from the optical axis\n(Manfroid & Selman 2001; Koch et al. 2004; Vandame et al.,\nin preparation). Automated software to correct for this effect\nhas been developed but due to time constraints it has not yet\nbeen applied to these data.\nThe final step of the data reduction process involves the\nassessment of the quality of the reduced images. Following vi-\nsual inspection, each reduced image is graded, with the grades\nranging from A (best) to D (worst). This grade refers only\nto the visual aspect of the data (e.g. background, cosmetics).\nOut of 150 reduced images covering (see Sect. 3) the selected\nXMM-Newton fields, 104 were graded A, 35 B, 7 C and 4 D.\nThe images with grades C and D are listed in Table 6. The ta-\nble, ordered by field and date, lists: in Col. 1 the field name;\nin Col. 2 the passband; in Col. 3 the civil date when the night\nstarted (YYYY-MM-DD); in Col. 4 the grade given by the vi-\nsual inspection; and in Col. 5 the primary motive for the grade.\nIt is important to emphasize that the reduced images must be\ngraded, as grades are used in the preparation of the final image\nstacks. In particular, reduced images with grade D have no sci-\nentific value and were not released and were discarded in the\nstacking process discussed in the next section.\nThe success rate of the automatic reduction process is better\nthan 95% and most of the lower grades are associated with ob-\nservational problems rather than inadequate performance of the\nsoftware operating in an un-supervised mode. An interesting\npoint is that occasionally R-band images are also affected by\nfringing (see Table 6) \u2013 for instance, in the nights of August 6\nand September 23 and 29, 2003, all from the contributing pro-\ngram. The night of August 6 is one of the nights for which\nthe computed R-band zeropoint deviates from the median. This\npoints out the need to consider applying fringing correction\nalso in the R-band, at least in some cases. The R-band fring-\ning problem accounts for five out of seven grade C images.\nThe remaining cases are due to stray-light and strong shape\ndistortions.\nIt should also be pointed out that the reduced images show\na number of cosmic ray hits. This is because the construc-\ntion of RBs was optimized for removing cosmic ray features\nin the final stacks using a thresholding technique. To this end\nthe number of images in an RB was minimized for some field\nand filter combinations to have at least three reduced images\nentering the SB.\n842 J. P.

Final products\n5.1. Images\nThe 146 reduced images with grades better than D were con-\nverted into 44 stacked (co-added) images using the EIS Data\nReduction System. The system creates both a final stack, by\nco-adding different reduced images taken of the same field with\nthe same filter (see Appendix C), and an associated product log\nwith additional information about the stacking process and the\nfinal image. Note that all stacks (and catalogs) and their asso-\nciated product logs are publicly available from the EIS survey\nrelease and ESO Science Archive Facility pages6.\nThe final stacks are illustrated in Fig. 2 which shows\ncutouts from color composite images of the 12 fields. From this\nfigure, one can easily see the broad variety of fields observed\nby this survey \u2013 dense stellar fields (XMM-01, XMM-02,\nXMM-12), sometimes with diffuse emission (XMM-11), ex-\ntended objects (e.g. XMM-08), and empty fields at high galac-\ntic latitude (e.g. XMM-07). While the constraints imposed by\nthe system normally lead to good results, visual inspection of\nthe images after stacking revealed that at least in one case the\nfinal stacked image was significantly degraded by the inclu-\nsion of a reduced image (graded B) with high-amplitude noise.\nTherefore, this image was not included in the production of\nthe corresponding stack. The reason for this problem is being\ninvestigated and may lead to the definition of additional con-\nstraints for the automatic rejection algorithm being currently\nused.\nBefore being released the stacks were again examined by\neye and graded. Out of 44 stacks, 33 were graded A, 10 B, and\n1 C, with no grade D being assigned. In addition to the grade\na comment may be associated and a list of all images with some\ncomment can be found in the README file associated to this\nrelease in the EIS web-pages. The comments refer mostly to\nimages with poor background subtraction either due to very\nbright stars (XMM-12) or extended, bright galaxies (XMM-08,\nXMM-09) in the field. It is important to emphasize that the\n6 http:\/\/www.eso.org\/science\/eis\/surveys\/release_\nXMM.html for catalogs and http:\/\/archive.eso.org\/archive\/\npublic_datasets.html for the latest release of stacked images\nmade in July 2005.\nreduction mode for these data was optimized for extragalac-\ntic, non-crowded fields, which is not optimal for some of these\nfields. Residual fringing is also observed in some stacks such\nas that of XMM-10 in the R-band and XMM-04, XMM-06 in\nthe I-band.\nAs mentioned in the previous section, to improve the rejec-\ntion of cosmic rays, the RBs were constructed so that in most\ncases the stack blocks (SB) consist of at least 3 reduced im-\nages as input. This allows for the use of a thresholding pro-\ncedure, with the threshold set to 2.5\u03c3, to remove cosmic ray\nhits from the final stacked image. Even with this thresholding\nthe stacks consisting of only three RBs (totaling 5 exposures),\nmostly B-band images, still show some cosmic ray hits. This\nhappens primarily in the regions of the inter-chip gaps, where\nfewer images contribute to the final stack. Also, the automatic\nsatellite track masking algorithm has proven to be efficient in\nremoving both bright and faint tracks. The most extreme case is\n3 satellite tracks of varying intensity in a single exposure. The\nregions affected by satellite tracks in the original images were\nflagged in the weight-map images and thus are properly re-\nmoved from the stacked image. Naturally, in the regions where\na satellite track was found in one of the contributing images\nthe noise is slightly higher in the stacked image. This is also\nreflected in the final weight-map image.\nThe accuracy of the final photometric calibration of course\ndepends on the accuracy of the photometric calibration of the\nreduced images which are used to produce the final co-added\nstacks and the number of independent photometric nights in\nwhich these were observed (see Table 7). The former depends\nnot only on the quality of the night but also on the adopted\ncalibration plan. To preview the quality of the photometric cal-\nibration, Table 7 provides information on the number of re-\nduced images and number of independent nights for each pass-\nband and filter. The table gives for each field in: Col. 1 the\nfield identification; Cols. 2\u20134 for each passband the number\nof reduced images with the number in parenthesis being the\nnumber of independent nights in which they were observed.\nComplementing this information Table 8 shows the best type\nof solution available for each field\/filter combination.

Above are cut-outs from color images of XMM-01 to XMM-12 (from top left to bottom right) to illustrate the wide variety of fields\nthe pipeline can successfully handle. The color images are BVR composite were R-band data is available, BVI otherwise. The side length of\nthe images displayed here is 7.\u20329 \u00d7 5.\u20326. In these images North is up and East is to the left. These composite color images also demonstrate the\naccuracy of the astrometric calibration independently achieved in each passband.\nthe passbands indicated. Solutions with more free parameters\nin general indicate better airmass and color coverage, yielding\nbetter photometric calibration. Examination of these two tables\nprovide some insight into the quality of the photometric cali-\nbration of each final stack, as reported below.\nThe main properties of the stacks produced for each field\nand filter are summarized in Table 9. The table gives: in Col. 1\nthe field identifier; in Col. 2 the passband; in Col. 3 the total\nintegration time T int in seconds, of the final stack; in Col. 4 the\nnumber of contributing reduced images or RBs; in Col. 5 the\ntotal number of science frames contributing to the final stack;\nin Cols. 6 and 7 the seeing in arcseconds and the point-spread\nfunction (PSF) anisotropy measured in the final stack; in Col. 8\nthe limiting magnitude, mlim, estimated for the final image stack\nfor a 2\u2032\u2032 aperture, 5\u03c3 detection limit in the AB system; in Col. 9\nthe grade assigned to the final image during visual inspection\n(ranging from A to D); in Col. 10 the fraction (in percentage)\nof observing time relative to that originally planned.\nThis table shows that for most stacks the desired limit-\ning magnitude was met in V (24.92 mag) or even slightly ex-\nceeded in B (25.20 mag). The R- and I-band images are slightly\nshallower than originally proposed with median limiting mag-\nnitudes of 24.66 mag and 24.39 mag. Still, when only the\nhigh-galactic latitude fields are included the median limiting\nmagnitudes are fainter \u2013 25.33 (B), 25.05 (V), 25.36 (R) and\n24.58 (I) mag. All magnitudes are given in the AB system. The\nmedian seeing of all stacked images is 0.\u2032\u203294 with the best and\nworst values being 0.\u2032\u203260 and 1.\u2032\u203251, respectively. This is signif-\nicantly better than the seeing requirement of 1.\u2032\u20322 specified for\nthis survey.\n844 J. P.

This field was observed as a single OB on\nFebruary 3, 2003 for which no standard stars were ob-\nserved. Since this is a galactic field there are no comple-\nmentary observations from the contributing program, and\ntherefore these observations cannot be calibrated.\n\u2013 XMM-01 (I) \u2013 This field at low galactic latitude is very\ncrowded and no acceptable fringing map could be produced\nfrom the science exposures in the field. The de-fringing was\ndone with an external fringing map generated from science\nimages taken on empty fields close in time to the XMM-01\nI-band observations.\n\u2013 XMM-02 (R) \u2013 The observations for this pointing and filter\nwere done with one OB (5 exposures) on February 2, 2003\nfor which no standard stars observations were carried out.\n\u2013 XMM-02 (I) \u2013 The observations for this pointing and\nfilter were done with two OBs (10 exposures each) on\nFebruary 2, 2003 for which no standard stars observations\nwere carried out. Like for XMM-01 (I) an external fringing\nmap was used.\n\u2013 XMM-03 (V) \u2013 The V-band calibration on the night of\nMarch 26, 2003 yields a 3-parameter fit that deviates from\nthe median of the solutions by roughly 0.26 mag (less\nthan 3\u03c3).\n\u2013 XMM-04 (I) \u2013 Low level fringing is still visible in the final\nstacked image.\n\u2013 XMM-06 (I) \u2013 As in XMM-04, low level fringing is still\nvisible in the final stack.\n\u2013 XMM-07 (B) \u2013 From the three reduced images available\nonly two were used for stacking because of the high ampli-\ntude of noise in one of them which greatly affected the final\nproduct.\n\u2013 XMM-07 (R) \u2013 This field was observed in four nights\n(August 6, and September 23, 27, and 28, 2003) as part\nof the contributing program. For the night of August 6\na 3-parameter fit solution was obtained. However, this so-\nlution deviates by roughly 0.25 mag relative to the median\nof all R-band solutions.\n\u2013 XMM-07 (I) \u2013 There is a visible stray light reflection at the\nlower right corner of the image.\n\u2013 XMM-08 (V) \u2013 The bright central galaxy is larger than\nthe dithering pattern, thus making it difficult to estimate\nthe background in its neighborhood. As a consequence the\nbackground subtraction procedure does not work properly.\n\u2013 XMM-08 (I) \u2013 The comments about the background sub-\ntraction for the V-band image also apply to the I-band.\nThis field was observed using 3 OBs (which in this case\nalso correspond to 3 RBs) on two nights (March 30, 2003,\none OB and April 2, 2003, two OBs). On the night of\nApril 2 a 3-parameter solution was obtained for which the\nZP determined deviates significantly (more than 3\u03c3) from\nthe median of all solutions, even though the conditions of\nthe night seem to have been adequate. The reason for this\npoor solution is at present unknown. Poor fringing correc-\ntion is a possibility but needs to be confirmed. The zero-\npoint for the two reduced images taken in this night has\nbeen replaced by a default value.\n\u2013 XMM-09 (BVI) \u2013 The preceding comment about back-\nground subtraction (see XMM-08) can be repeated here for\nthe large galaxy in the North-West corner of the image. The\nbackground subtraction procedure fails, creating a strong\nvariation around the galaxy.\n\u2013 XMM-10 (B) \u2013 This stack has a shorter exposure time than\nthe others released, leading to higher background noise.\n\u2013 XMM-10 (R) \u2013 This field was observed in the nights of\nAugust 6, and September 23 and 29, 2003 as part of con-\ntributing program. As in case of XMM-07 the solution for\nAugust 6 deviates somewhat from the median.\n\u2013 XMM-11 (V) \u2013 The same comments as for the photometric\ncalibration of XMM-03 (V) apply to this image.\n\u2013 XMM-11 (I) \u2013 Like for XMM-01 (I) an external fringing\nmap was used.\n\u2013 XMM-12 (BR) \u2013 The background subtraction near bright\nstars is poor.\n\u2013 XMM-12 (V) \u2013 The preceding comment about background\nsubtraction also applies to this image.

Catalogs\nFor the 8 fields located at high-galactic latitudes with |b| > 30\u25e6,\na total of 28 catalogs were produced (not all fields were ob-\nserved in all filters, see Table 7). Catalogs for the remaining\nlow-galactic latitude fields were not produced since these are\ncrowded stellar fields for which SExtractor alone is not well\nsuited. As in the case of the Pre-FLAMES survey (Zaggia et al.,\nin preparation), it is preferable to use a PSF fitting algorithm\nsuch as DAOPHOT (Stetson 1987). Details about the catalog\n846 J. P. Dietrich et al.: ESO imaging survey: optical follow-up of 12 selected XMM-Newton fields\nproduction pipeline available in the EIS data reduction system\nare presented in Appendix D.\nAs mentioned earlier, the fields considered here cover\na range of galactic latitudes of varying density of objects, in\nsome cases with bright point and extended sources in the field.\nIn this sense this survey is a useful benchmark to evaluate the\nperformance of the procedures adopted for the un-supervised\nextraction of sources and the production of science-grade cat-\nalogs. This also required carrying out tests to fine-tune the\nchoice of input parameters to provide the best possible compro-\nmise. Still, it should be emphasized that the catalogs produced\nare in some sense general-purpose catalogs. Specific science\ngoals may require other choices of software (e.g. DAOPHOT,\nIMCAT) and\/or input parameters.\nA key issue in the creation of catalogs is to minimize the\nnumber of spurious detections and in general, the adopted ex-\ntraction parameters work well. However, there are unavoid-\nable situations where this is not the case. Among these are:\n(1) the presence of ghost images near bright stars. Their loca-\ntion and size vary with position and magnitude making it dif-\nficult to deal with them in an automatic way; (2) the presence\nof bright galaxies because the algorithm for automatic mask-\ning does not work well in this case; (3) residual fringing in the\nimage; (4) the presence of stray light, in particular, associated\nwith bright objects just outside the observed field; (5) when the\nimage is slightly rotated, the trimming procedure does not trim\nthe corners of the image correctly, leading to the inclusion of\nregions with a low S\/N. In these corners many spuriously de-\ntected objects are not flagged as such. The XMM-Newton fields\nare a good showcase for these various situations.\nAnother important issue to consider is the choice of the\nparameter that controls the deblending of sources. Experience\nshows that the effects of deblending depend on the type of field\nbeing considered (e.g. empty or crowded fields, extended ob-\nject, etc.) and vary across the image. Some tests were carried\nout but further analysis of this topic may be required.\nA number of tests have also been carried out to find an ade-\nquate compromise for the scaling factor used in the calculation\nof the size of the automatic masks (see Appendix D) which de-\npends on the passband and the magnitude of the object. While\nthe current masking procedure generally works well, the op-\ntimal scaling will require further investigation. It is also clear\nthat for precision work, such as e.g. lensing studies, additional\nmasking by hand is unavoidable. It should also be mentioned\nthat occasionally the masking of saturated stars fails. This oc-\ncurs in five out of the 28 catalogs released and only for\u223c10% of\nthe saturated stars in them. These cases are likely to be of stars\njust barely saturated, at the limit of the settings for automatic\nmasking.\nBearing these points in mind, the following comments can\nbe made regarding some of the released catalogs:\n\u2013 XMM-03 (B) \u2013 The automatic masking misses a few satu-\nrated stars.\n\u2013 XMM-06 (B) \u2013 Due to a small rotation of the image of\na few degrees the trimming frame does not mask the\nborders completely.\n\u2013 XMM-06 (V) \u2013 The deblending near bright galaxies is\ninsufficient. Deblending near bright stars is too strong.\n\u2013 XMM-06 (R) \u2013 As in the V-band image the deblending near\nbright galaxies is insufficient.\n\u2013 XMM-06 (I) \u2013 As in the V-band image the deblending near\nbright galaxies is insufficient. Spurious object detections\nare caused by reflection features of bright stars and stray\nlight reflections.\n\u2013 XMM-07 (B) \u2013 Spurious objects in the corners are caused\nby insufficient trimming.\n\u2013 XMM-08 (B) \u2013 Masks are missing for a number of satu-\nrated stars. XMM-08 contains an extended, bright galaxy\n(NGC 4666) at the center of the image, plus a compan-\nion galaxy located South-East of it. The presence of these\ngalaxies leads to a large number of spurious object detec-\ntions in their surroundings in all bands.\n\u2013 XMM-08 (VRI) \u2013 See the comments about spurious object\ndetections for XMM-08 B-band.\n\u2013 XMM-09 (B) \u2013 Cosmic rays are misidentified as real ob-\njects. The very bright galaxy located at the North-West of\nthe image leads to the detection of a large number of spu-\nrious objects extending over a large area (10 \u2032 \u00d7 10\u2032) in\nall bands. Even though the galaxy has been automatically\nmasked, the affected area is much larger than that predicted\nby the algorithm, which is optimized for stars. Thus, addi-\ntional masking by hand would be required.\n\u2013 XMM-09 (VI) \u2013 See the comments about spurious object\ndetections for XMM-09 B-band.\n\u2013 XMM-10 (R) \u2013 The stacked image was graded C because\nof fringing. The fringing pattern causes a high number of\nspurious object detections along the fringing pattern, lead-\ning to a catalog with no scientific value. This catalog is\nreleased exclusively as an illustration.\n6. Discussion\n6.1. Comparison of counts and colors\nA key element in public surveys is to provide potential users\nwith information regarding the quality of the products released.\nTo this end a number of checks of the data are carried out and\nseveral diagnostic plots summarizing the results are automati-\ncally produced by the EIS Survey System. They are an integral\npart of the product logs available from the survey release page.\nDue to the large number of plots produced in the verification\nprocess these are not reproduced here. Instead a small set illus-\ntrating the results are presented.\nA relatively simple statistics that can be used to check\nthe catalogs and the star\/galaxy separation criteria is to com-\npare the star and galaxy number counts derived from the\ndata to that of other authors and\/or to model predictions. As\nan example, Fig. 3 shows the galaxy counts in different ob-\nserved passbands for the field XMM-07. Here objects with\nCLASS_STAR < 0.95 or fainter than the object classification\nlimit were used to create the sample of galaxies. Note that the\nnumber counts shown in the figure take into account the effec-\ntive area of the catalog, which is available in its FIELDS table\n(see Appendix D). As can be seen, the computed counts are\nJ. P. Dietrich et al.: ESO imaging survey: optical follow-up of 12 selected XMM-Newton fields 847\nFig. 3. Galaxy number counts for the\nXMM-07 field for the different passbands\nas indicated in each panel. Full circles\nrepresent EIS data points, open triangles\nMetcalfe et al. (2001), open squares Arnouts\net al. (2001).\nconsistent with those obtained by previous authors for all pass-\nbands (Arnouts et al. 2001; Metcalfe et al. 2001).\nA complementary test is to compare the stellar counts\nto those predicted by models, such as the galactic model of\nGirardi et al. (2005, and references therein). Generally, the\nagreement of model predictions is excellent for B- and V-band\ncatalogs, becoming gradually worse for R- and especially in\nI-band, near the classification limit, with the counts falling\nbelow model predictions (e.g. XMM-09 I-band). Note, how-\never, that plots of CLASS_STAR versus magnitude show a less\nwell defined stellar locus for these bands. It is thus reasonable\nto assume that the observed differences between catalogs and\nmodel predictions are due to misclassification of stars as galax-\nies. Alternatively, these may also reflect short-comings in the\nmodel adopted. However, a detailed discussion of this issue is\nbeyond the scope of the present paper.\nWhile useful to detect gross errors, number counts are not\nsufficiently sensitive to identify more subtle differences. The\ncomparison of expected colors of stars with theoretical mod-\nels provides a better test of the accuracy of the photometric\ncalibration in the different bands. Using color transformations\ncomputed in the same way as in Girardi et al. (2002), the theo-\nretical colors of stars can be obtained. Such comparisons were\nmade for all five fields with data in four passbands. The re-\nsults for two cases, XMM-06 and XMM-07 are illustrated in\nFigs. 4 and 5, respectively, which show (B \u2212 V) \u00d7 (V \u2212 I) and\n(V \u2212 R) \u00d7 (R \u2212 I) diagrams. For XMM-06 the data are in ex-\ncellent agreement with the colors of stars predicted by the the-\noretical model, with only a small (<\u223c0.05 mag) offset in R \u2212 I,\nindicating a good calibration. On the other hand, for XMM-07,\none observes a significant offset (\u223c0.2 mag) in B\u2212V. This field\nwas chosen because it exemplifies the worst offset observed rel-\native to the theoretical models. Since this offset is only visible\nin the (B \u2212 V) \u00d7 (V \u2212 I) diagram, it suggests a problem in the\nB-band data. Data for this field\/filter combination comes from\ntwo nights 2003-06-30 and 2003-08-06. Closer inspection of\nthe observations in the night of 2003-06-30 show that: (1) the\nstandard stars observations span only 2 h in the middle of the\nnight; (2) the photometric zeropoint derived using the available\nmeasurements (24.59 mag) is reasonably close (\u223c1\u03c3) to the\nmedian value of the long-term trend (24.71 mag); (3) the B ex-\nposures were taken close to sunrise; and (4) there was a signif-\nicant increase in the amplitude of the DIMM seeing at the time\nthe XMM-07 exposures under consideration were taken. For\nthe night of 2003-08-06 standards cover a much larger time in-\nterval, yielding a zeropoint of 24.82 mag with comparable dif-\nference relative to the long-term median value for this filter as\ngiven above. The results suggest that the observed problem is\nnot related to the calibration of the night, as will be seen below.\n6.2. Comparison with other reductions\nAs shown above, comparison of different statistics, based on\nthe sources extracted from the final image stacks, to those\nof other authors and to model predictions provide an internal\nmeans to assess the quality of the data products. However, in\nthe particular case of this survey one can also benefit from the\nfact that about one third of the accumulated data has been in-\ndependently reduced by the Bonn group in charge of the con-\ntributing program (Sect. 3). The images in common are used in\nthis section to make a direct comparison of the astrometric and\nphotometric calibrations. In their reduction, the Bonn group\nused their \u201cGarching-Bonn Deep Survey\u201d (GaBoDS) pipeline\n(Erben et al. 2005).\nA total of 15 stacked images in the B-, V-, and R-bands\nwere produced and compared to those produced by the\nEIS\/MVM pipeline. The astrometric calibration was done us-\ning the GSC-2.2 catalog, the same as that of the EIS reduction.\nIn contrast to the reductions carried out by the EIS system,\n848 J. P.

The type\nof solution (number of free parameters of a linear fit) for a night\nwas decided on a case by case basis after visual inspection of\nthe linear fits.\nTo carry out the comparison of the data products, catalogs\nwere produced from the EIS and GaBoDS images using the\nsame extraction parameters. These catalogs were associated\nwith each other to produce a merged catalog for each field and\npassband. The results of this comparison for all the available\nimages in common are presented in Table 10. The table gives:\nin Col. 1 the field name; in Col. 2 the original target name; in\nCols. 3 and 4 the mean offset and standard deviation in right as-\ncension and declination in arcseconds; in Col. 5 the mean and\nstandard deviation of the magnitude differences as measured\nwithin an aperture of 3\u2032\u2032. The mean and standard deviation\nof the magnitude differences were determined in the interval\n17 < m < 21. This range was chosen to avoid saturated objects\nat the bright end and to limit the comparison to objects whose\nestimated error in magnitude is smaller than about 0.01 mag at\nthe faint end. An iterative 5\u03c3 rejection, which allowed rejected\npoints to re-enter if they are compatible with later determina-\ntions of the mean and variance, was employed to ignore obvi-\nous outliers in the computation of the mean and the standard\ndeviation.\nFigure 6 illustrates the results obtained from the compar-\nison of the position of sources extracted from images pro-\nduced by the two pipelines for the particular case of XMM-06\nin R-band. From the figure one can see that the positions of\nthe sources agree remarkably well. In fact, as summarized in\nTable 10, the typical mean deviation is \u223c20 mas with a stan-\ndard deviation of \u223c50 mas, confirming the excellent agreement\nin the external (absolute) astrometric calibration to be distin-\nguished from the internal calibration discussed later.\nJ.

This field shows that the pho-\ntometry of both reductions agree remarkably well. The mea-\nsured scatter of the magnitude differences is small (\u223c0.03 mag)\nfor this as well as for most other fields. This result indicates\nthat the internal procedures used by the two pipelines to esti-\nmate chip-to-chip variations are consistent. Moreover, inspec-\ntion of the last column of Table 10 shows that for 11 out of\n15 cases the mean offsets are <\u223c0.05 mag.

It is important to emphasize\nthat differences in the computed zeropoint of the photometric\nsolutions are <\u223c0.08 mag, even for the cases with the largest dif-\nferences such as XMM-05 (R) and XMM-07 (B). The value of\n0.08 mag is consistent with the scatter measured from the long-\nterm trend shown by the zeropoints computed over a large time\ninterval, as presented in the EIS release of WFI photometric\nsolutions, thus representing the uncertainty in the photomet-\nric calibration. Therefore, the offsets reported in the table can-\nnot be explained by differences in the photometric calibration\n850 J. P.

This point is investigated in more detail for XMM-05\nR-band and XMM-07 B-band.\nAll R-band images for XMM-05 were taken in one night\nand the photometric solutions determined by both teams agree\nvery well. While the source of the discrepancy has not yet been\nidentified, the stellar locus in the (B\u2212V) \u00d7 (V\u2212 I) and (V\u2212R) \u00d7\n(R \u2212 I) diagrams based on the source catalog extracted from\nthe EIS images yield results which are consistent with model\npredictions, suggesting that the problem may lie in the Bonn\nreductions. On the other hand, the large offset (0.34 mag) be-\ntween the B-band observations of the field XMM-07 is most\nlikely caused by the data taken in the night 2003-06-30. While\nthe standard star observations in this night suggest relatively\ngood photometric conditions, the available measurements span\nonly about 2 h in the middle of the night, while the science ex-\nposures were taken at the very end of the night. Inspection of\nthe ambient condition shows a rapid increase in the amplitude\nof the DIMM seeing which could be related to a localized varia-\ntion in the transparency. In fact, the Bonn pipeline, which mon-\nitors the relative differences in magnitude for objects extracted\nfrom different exposures in an OB, finds strong flux variations\nthat could be caused by changes in the sky transparency or by\nthe twilight at sunrise. The latter could also account for the fact\nthat these observations were later repeated in August of that\nyear. The important point is that the Bonn group discarded the\ncalibration of the frames taken in 2003-06-30, while the\nautomatic procedure adopted by EIS did not.\nIn addition to evaluating the accuracy of the image reg-\nistration and photometric calibration, the independent reduc-\ntions also offer the possibility to evaluate the shape of the im-\nages. To this end the PSF of bright, non-saturated stars on the\nR-band images for XMM-04 (MS 1054.4\u22120321) and XMM-06\n(RX J0505.3\u22122849) were measured and compared. These are\nthe only two cases in which the final stacked images were pro-\nduced by using exactly the same reduced images. This is caused\nby the differences in the criteria adopted in building the SBs.\nIn the case of XMM-06, one finds that the size and pattern\nof the PSF are in good agreement and both reductions yield\na smooth PSF with no obvious effects of chip boundaries over\nthe whole field. The situation is different for XMM-04 as can\nbe seen in Fig. 8, which shows a map of the PSF distortion ob-\ntained by the EIS (left panel) and Bonn (right panel) groups.\nWhile the overall pattern of distortion is similar, the amplitude\nof the PSF distortion of the EIS reduction is significantly larger\nand exhibits jumps across chip borders. Although the effect is\nsmall in absolute terms, it should be taken into account for ap-\nplications relying on accurate shape measurements. The rea-\nson for these differences is likely due to the fact that the as-\ntrometric calibration in the EIS pipeline is done for each chip\nrelative to an absolute external reference, without using the ad-\nditional constraint that the chips are rigidly mounted to form\na mosaic. By neglecting this constraint, the solution for each\nchip in the mosaic may vary slightly depending on the dithered\nexposure being considered and the density and spatial distri-\nbution of the reference stars in and around the field of interest.\nSince the accuracy of the GSC-2.2 of 250 mas is approximately\nequal to the pixel size of WFI of 0.\u2032\u2032238, in addition to the abso-\nlute calibration of the image centroid, finding an internal rela-\ntive astrometric solution further ensures that images in different\ndithered exposures map more precisely onto each other during\nco-addition. Imperfections in the internal relative astrometry\nresult in objects not being matched exactly onto each other,\nthereby degrading the PSF of the co-added image.\n6.3. X-ray\/optical correlation\nAs pointed out in the introduction, the ultimate goal of this op-\ntical survey has been to provide catalogs from which one can\nidentify and characterize the optical properties of X-ray sources\ndetected with deep XMM-Newton exposures.\nX-ray source lists for the high-galactic latitude fields\nwere produced by the AIP-node of the SSC. These are\nbased on pipeline processed event lists which were obtained\nwith the latest official version of the Software Analysis\nSystem (SAS-V6.1). In its current version this SAS-based\npipeline does not work with stacked images.\nSource detection was performed as a three-stage process\nusing eboxdetect in local and in map mode followed by\na multi-PSF fit with emldetect for all sources present in\nthe initial source lists. The multi-PSF fit invoked here works\non 15 input images, i.e. 5 per EPIC camera. The five energy\nbands used per camera cover the ranges: (1) 0.1\u20130.5 keV;\n(2) 0.5\u20131.0 keV; (3) 1.0\u20132.0 keV; (4) 2.0\u20134.5 keV; and\n(5) 4.5\u201312.0 keV.\nThe SAS task eposcorr was applied to the X-ray source\nlist.

This approach is superior to that used for the creation\nof source lists which are currently stored in the XMM-Newton\nScience Archive since it makes use of X-ray photons from all\ncameras simultaneously. It also distinguishes between point-\nlike and extended X-ray sources. In this paper we only consider\npoint-like sources. Extended sources at high galactic latitudes\nare almost exclusively galaxy clusters and cannot be matched\nwith individual objects in the optical catalogs. Examining their\nproperties is beyond the scope of this work.\nIn carrying out the matching between the XMM-Newton\nsource lists and those extracted from the optical images, it is\nimportant to note that the X-ray images lie fully within the FOV\nof the WFI images. Hence an optical counterpart can be poten-\ntially found for any of the X-ray sources.\nFrom the high-galactic latitudes there are 3 fields with\nmore than one observation. However, for XMM-05 only the\ntwo available observations with good time t > 10 ks were con-\nsidered. One of them had technical problems that prevented\nit from being used for catalog extraction. For XMM-09 the\nsource list created contained many spurious sources due to\nremaining calibration uncertainties in the pipeline processed\nimages and was not considered further. Figures showing the\nresults of the source detection process with all sources indi-\ncated on an image in TIFF format, the composite X-ray im-\nages, and the source lists can be found on the web-page of the\nAIP-SSC-node7. Below these source lists are used to identify\ntheir optical counterparts.\n7 http:\/\/www.aip.de\/groups\/xray\/XMM_EIS\/\nThe extraction yields 995 point-like X-ray sources of\nwhich 742 are unique. The difference between these two num-\nbers reflects differences in the three independent source\nlists extracted from the field XMM-07. The mean flux of\nthe 742 unique X-ray sources is Fmean(0.5\u22122.0 keV) =\n8.5 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121, the median flux in this band is\nFmed(0.5\u22122.0 keV) = 3.7 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. Sources with\nF(0.5\u22122.0 keV) = 4 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 are detected already\nwith an exposure time of 5 ks, while the limiting flux in the\nEIS-XMM fields at the deepest exposure levels is F lim \u0004 3 \u00d7\n10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121.\nNearly all the X-ray source lists were matched to cata-\nlogs extracted from the R-band images, with the exception\nof field XMM-08, which was correlated with the I-band.\nTwo search radii, 2\u2032\u2032 and 5\u2032\u2032, were used. The larger value re-\nflects the typical statistical error in X-ray source position de-\ntermination (typically in the range \u223c0.5 \u2032\u2032\u22122\u2032\u2032), coupled with\nan additional systematic error component (\u223c1 \u2032\u2032) in the attitude\nof the spacecraft. Hence, a matching radius of 5 \u2032\u2032 corresponds\nto roughly a 2\u22123\u03c3 uncertainty for most of the sources. The\nsmaller correlation radius is justified by the distribution of the\npositional accuracy of the X-ray sources, which peaks at \u223c1.\u2032\u20323.\nIt extends up to 3\u2032\u2032 with the majority of sources (92%) being\nwithin 2\u2032\u2032.\nThe results of X-ray source extraction and their cross-\nidentification with their optical counterparts for 7 high-galactic\nlatitude fields (9 observations) are summarized in Table 11. For\neach field two rows are given: the first row refers to the match-\ning done with a 5\u2032\u2032 search radius, in the second row the num-\nbers for the smaller 2\u2032\u2032 search radius are reported.

In Cols. 13\u201315 BV,\nBI and BVI refer to objects which are simultaneously detected\nin the respective passband but do not correspond to matches\nof X-ray sources with the reference catalog. Because we only\nlist objects without match in the reference catalog the number\nof objects reported in Cols. 10\u201315 is in some cases higher in\nthe second row than in the first row. These are X-ray sources\nwith matches in B-, V-, or I-band within a circle of 2 \u2032\u2032 having\nmatches in the reference catalog only in the larger 5 \u2032\u2032 search\nradius.\nThe results of the X-ray\/optical cross-correlation for all\nfields with available R-band catalogs (619 unique sources) are\ndisplayed in Fig. 9. The figure shows: (top left) the multiplicity\nfunction; (top right) the cumulative fraction of X-ray sources\nwith optical counterparts in a 5\u2032\u2032 search radius (dashed line) and\na 2\u2032\u2032 search radius (straight line); (bottom left) the distribution\nof the positional offsets between X-ray and optical sources; and\n(bottom right) the corresponding scatter plot in the \u03b1 \u00d7 \u03b4 plane.\nNote that in three panels all m = 1 matches are represented by\nfilled histograms and\/or larger symbols.\nInspection of Fig. 9 shows that: (1) about 87% (61%) of the\nX-ray point sources have at least one optical counterpart within\nthe search radius of 5\u2032\u2032 (2\u2032\u2032) down to R \u223c 25 mag, and very\nfew sources have more than 3 matches. In only very few cases\none finds up to five associated optical sources, i.e., potential\nphysical counterparts; (2) only about 15% of the X-ray sources\nhave counterparts down to the Digital Sky Survey magnitude\nlimit (R \u223c 20.5), underscoring the need for dedicated opti-\ncal imaging in order to identify the X-ray source population;\n(3) the distribution of the X-ray\/optical positional offset peaks\nat around 1\u2032\u2032 for the sources with m = 1. The m = 1 matches\nare well concentrated within a circle of 2 \u2032\u2032. The distribution is\nalmost flat if all associations are considered. This underlines\nthat the true physical counterparts to the X-ray sources will be\nfound predominantly among the m = 1 sources, i.e. the near-\nest and in most cases single associated optical sources; (4) the\npositional differences between X-ray and optical coordinates\nseem to be randomly distributed.\nThe statement that the additional correlations found within\nthe greater search radius are chance alignments is strength-\nened by an estimate of the number of random matches between\nJ.

The black squares mark X-ray sources in this\nfield with matches to the optical catalogs in all four passbands.\nX-ray and optical sources. Using an average of 110 X-ray\nsources per field we can compute the total area covered by\nthe search circles with 5\u2032\u2032 (2\u2032\u2032) radius. Multiplying this with\nthe typical number density of sources in the optical cata-\nlogs (30 arcmin\u22122) we estimate 70 (12) random matches for\nan average field. The number of random matches within the\nsmaller correlation radius is well below the observed number\nof optical\/X-ray counterparts.\nIn addition, from this preliminary analysis the following\nconclusions can be drawn: (1) about 39% of the X-ray sources\nhave no associated optical source within 2 \u2032\u2032. This optical identi-\nfication completeness is comparable with that found by Eckart\net al. (2005) in a similar study of X-ray source samples, but\nthere may also be small contributions from sources with larger\noffsets than allowed by the adopted search radius, contamina-\ntion by spurious X-ray sources, and random matches with the\noptical catalogs; (2) over 50% of the m = 1 sources are de-\ntected in all the other bands available, within 1 \u2032\u2032; (3) corre-\nlations which occur at search radii greater than 2 \u2032\u2032 are most\nlikely random correlations with the comparably dense optical\ncatalogs; (4) all sources which are detected in RI are also de-\ntected in BV, indicating that the optical counterparts of the\nX-ray sources are not excessively red or, even if they are red,\nthe blue images are sufficiently deep to detect them; (5) the\nsmall number of X-ray sources matched with objects in the\nB- and V-band catalogs without matches in the R-band cat-\nalog suggests that we are also not dealing with excessively\nblue objects. Figure 10 shows color\u2013color diagrams for the\nfield XMM-06 for stars and galaxies in the field and compares\nit with the optical colors of X-ray sources matching objects\nin the optical catalogs. Stars and galaxies were selected using\nthe SExtractor CLASS_STAR classifier with the cuts made at\nCLASS_STAR < 0.1 and CLASS_STAR > 0.99 for galaxies\nand stars, respectively. These diagrams show that, as one would\nexpect, no specific sub-population of stars or galaxies can be\nidentified with the X-ray sources.\n7.

These\ndiagnostics are regularly produced by the system, forming an\nintegral part of it.\nIn the particular case of this survey, a number of frames\nhave been reduced by both EIS and the Bonn group, using in-\ndependent software thus allowing a direct comparison of the\nresulting images and catalogs to be made. From this compari-\nson one finds that the position of the sources extracted from im-\nages produced for the same field\/filter combination by the dif-\nferent pipelines are in excellent agreement with a mean offset\nof \u223c20 mas and a standard deviation of \u223c50 mas. Comparison\nof the magnitudes of the extracted sources shows that in gen-\neral the mean offset is <\u223c0.05 mag, consistent with the estimated\nerror of the photometric calibration of about 0.08 mag. Cases\nwith larger deviations were investigated further and the prob-\nlem with the two most extreme cases were found to be unre-\nlated to the calibration procedure. Instead, it demonstrates the\nneed for the implementation of additional procedures to cope\nwith the specific situation encountered and the need for a better\ncalibration plan. This discussion illustrates a couple of impor-\ntant points. First, that while an automatic process is prone to\nerrors in dealing with extreme but rare situations, reductions\ncarried out with human intervention are prone to random er-\nrors which can never be eliminated. Second, more robust pro-\ncedures can always be added or existing ones tuned to deal with\nexceptions once they are found. However, as always when deal-\ning with automatic reduction of large volumes of data, the real\nissue is to decide on the trade-off between coping with these\nrare exceptions and the speed of the process and margin of fail-\nures one is willing to accept.\nFinally, a comparison of the PSF distortions suggests\nthat some improvement could be achieved by requiring the\nEIS\/MVM to impose an additional constraint on the astromet-\nric solution to improve the internal registration. As mentioned\nearlier this can be achieved by imposing the geometrical con-\nstraint that the CCDs form a mosaic.\nPreliminary catalogs were also extracted from the available\nX-ray images and cross-correlated with the source lists pro-\nduced from the R-band images. From this analysis one finds\nthat about 61% of the X-ray sources have an optical counterpart\nwithin 2\u2032\u2032, most of which are unique. Out of these about 70%\nare detected in all the available passbands. Combined, these\nresults indicate that the adopted observing strategy success-\nfully yields the expected results of producing a large popula-\ntion of X-ray sources (\u223c300) with photometric information in\nfour passbands, therefore enabling a tentative classification and\nredshift estimation, sufficiently faint to require follow-up\nobservations with the VLT.\nThe present paper is one in the series presenting the re-\nsults of a variety of optical\/infrared surveys carried out by the\nEIS project.\nAcknowledgements.

Color composite X-ray images for the 12 fields considered in this paper (XMM-01 to XMM-12 from top left to bottom right). The color\nimages are composites within the so-called XID-band (0.5\u20134.5 keV).

Dietrich et al.: ESO imaging survey: optical follow-up of 12 selected XMM-Newton fields, Online Material p 3\nAppendix A: Comments on the individual fields\nBelow a broad overview of the 12 fields discussed in the present\npaper is given. It includes a description of their nature and\nthe original target of the X-ray observations. Details about\nthe exposure time per camera per observation are given on\nthe web-page.\n1. XMM-01\/RX J0925.7\u22124758 \u2013 The original target was\nthe ROSAT-discovered, galactic supersoft X-ray binary\nRX J0925.7\u22124758, also known as MR Vel (Motch et al.\n1994). The X-ray image is a superposition of two medium\ndeep (\u223c60 ks) observations with EPIC-PN in large window,\nEPIC-MOS1 in full frame, and EPIC-MOS2 in small win-\ndow mode. This results in a reasonably deep (\u223c115 ks) ex-\nposure in the common PN and MOS area (less than half of\nthe field of view).\n2. XMM-02\/RX J0720.4\u22123125 \u2013 Targeting the ROSAT-\ndiscovered isolated neutron star RX J0720.4\u22123125 (Haberl\net al. 1997), the X-ray image is a superposition of\nthree medium deep observations with all cameras in full\nframe. The bright target of the observation causes visible\nout-of-time (OOT) events in the X-ray images leading to\nbright stripes through the target. These stripes are fixed in\ndetector coordinates, hence they do not coincide in sky co-\nordinates resulting in three different OOT stripes.\n3. XMM-03\/HE 1104\u22121805 \u2013 The primary target of this\nXMM-Newton observation was the double-lensed quasar\nHE 1104\u22121805 (Wisotzki et al. 1993). This is an empty\nfield at high galactic latitude. The X-ray image is a com-\nbined image of the three EPIC cameras during the single\nobservation of the target. Bad space weather resulted in\na loss of \u223c65% of the total exposure and a rather shallow\nresulting image (\u223c10 ks).\n4. XMM-04\/MS1054.4\u20130321\u2013 The galaxy cluster MS 1054.4\u2013\n0321 at redshift of z = 0.83 is the most distant cluster in\nthe Einstein Medium Sensitive Survey and among the most\nmassive ones (Gioia et al. 1990; Stocke et al. 1991; Gioia\n& Luppino 1994). The X-ray image is a combined image\nof the three EPIC cameras of the single observation of the\ntarget, all taken in full frame mode.\n5. XMM-05\/BPM 16274 \u2013 The white dwarf BPM 16274 is at\nhigh galactic latitude. This field is used for calibrations of\nthe optical monitor on-board the XMM-Newton satellite.\nThe X-ray image is a superposition of six observations in\nfull frame mode of all three cameras. The archive contains\nalready many more data sets with other camera settings and\nthe observations in this field are ongoing.\n6. XMM-06\/RX J0505.3\u22122849 \u2013 This is a field at high galactic\nlatitude. The galaxy cluster RX J0505.3\u22122849 in the cen-\nter was detected as part of the SHARC survey (Burke et al.\n2003) at a redshift of z = 0.509. The X-ray image is the su-\nperposition of all three EPIC cameras, which were all oper-\nated in full frame mode. Only the PN suffered significantly\nfrom high background, resulting in a medium deep X-ray\nimage (\u223c45 ks).\n7. XMM-07\/LBQS 2212\u22121759 \u2013 In order to avoid potential\ndamage from the Leonid meteors when XMM intersects\ntheir trajectories annually, the spacecraft is oriented in the\nanti-Leonid direction for safety reasons. The field then re-\npeatedly chosen for observation was centered on the z =\n2.217 quasar LBQS 2212\u22121759 (Barkhouse & Hall 2001).\nThe X-ray image is a superposition of five observations\nwith all cameras in full frame mode. Enhanced background\naffected less than 15% of the observations resulting in\na truly deep field with more than 200 ks net exposure in\nall three cameras. The nominal target of the observations\nwas not discovered, the image is thus dominated by the\nserendipitous source content. The most prominent source\nis a new cluster of galaxies close to the center of the field.\n8. XMM-08\/NGC 4666 \u2013 The target of this field was the al-\nmost edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 4666 which dominates\nthe center of the field. Although the target was optically\nand X-ray extended, the target was included in the pub-\nlic survey since the target blocks only about 5% of the\nfield of view. The X-ray image is a combined image of the\nthree EPIC cameras of the single observation of the target,\nall taken in full frame mode.\n9. XMM-09\/QSO B1246\u2212057 \u2013 The target was the broad ab-\nsorption line quasar B1246\u2212057. The XMM-Newton ob-\nservation of the target was published by Grupe et al.\n(2003). The X-ray image is a combined image of the\nthree EPIC cameras of the single observation of the target,\nall taken in full frame mode. The field is unusual, about\none quarter of the field in the NE corner is almost devoid of\nX-ray sources. The dominant point-like object is the X-ray\ncounterpart of the Algol binary HD 111487 (RBS 1165).\n10. XMM-10\/PB 5062 \u2013 PB 5062 (also known as\nQSO B2202\u22120209) is a quasar at redshift z = 1.77\n(Yuan et al. 1998). The X-ray image is a combined image\nof the three EPIC cameras of the single observation of the\ntarget, all taken in full frame mode.\n11. XMM-11\/Sgr A \u2013 The target of this field is the center of our\nMilky Way. The X-ray image is a superposition of five ob-\nservations with all cameras in full frame mode. The obser-\nvations were severely affected by background flares result-\ning in a loss of more than 50% of the observation time.\nNevertheless, repeated observations of the field resulted\nin a medium deep exposure with more than 40 ks expo-\nsure in all three cameras. The image is dominated by dif-\nfuse emission from the galactic center region. In addition\nthere are two classes of point-sources, heavily absorbed,\ni.e. likely background sources with hard X-ray spectra and\nforeground sources with soft X-ray spectra.\n12. XMM-12\/WR 46 \u2013 This object also known as HD 104994 is\na Wolf-Rayet star. The X-ray image is a combined image\nof the three EPIC cameras of the single observation of the\ntarget, all taken in full frame mode. Data loss due to en-\nhanced background is insignificant resulting in a medium\ndeep field with more than 70 ks exposure in each camera.\nAppendix B: Photometry\nThe photometric calibration is done in a fully automated way\nby the EIS Data Reduction System (da Costa et al., in prepa-\nration) calibrating all data to the Vega magnitude system. The\nphotometric pipeline extracts catalogs from the standard star\nJ. P. Dietrich et al.: ESO imaging survey: optical follow-up of 12 selected XMM-Newton fields, Online Material p 4\nfields, and measures fluxes at different apertures to allow for\na growth curve inspection. The positions and flux measure-\nments for each object are cross-correlated with those corre-\nsponding to known standard stars as stored in a database. The\nmatched standard stars are then used to determine the photo-\nmetric zeropoint, extinction and color term from a linear fit.\nFinally, the zeropoint for each science frame is derived from\nthe linear fit derived for the night of observation.\nIn the case of optical observations, as in this paper, the cal-\nibrations have been based on observations of Landolt (1992)\nstandard star fields. The magnitudes were measured in 6 \u2032\u2032 aper-\ntures, which from monitoring the growth curve of all measured\nstars proved to be adequate. The linear fits had from one to\nthree free parameters depending on the available airmass and\ncolor coverage provided by the calibration plan. In cases where\nthe airmass and\/or color coverage is insufficient, pre-specified\nvalues for the extinction and color term, either determined from\nother solutions or from theoretical models, are used.\nThe photometric pipeline computes photometric parame-\nters for all possible types of fits (one to three free parameters)\nand chooses the solution with the smallest rms to be the best\nsolution for the night. A night is considered photometric if this\nscatter is less than a pre-defined value, which at the present\ntime is taken to be 0.1 mag. If none of the solutions satisfies\nthis criterion and\/or the solution found yields unrealistic re-\nsults (e.g. negative extinction) then the night is considered non-\nphotometric and a default value for the zeropoint is adopted and\nits error set to \u22121. For nights without observation of standard\nstar fields, a default zeropoint and an error of \u22122 are assigned to\nthe image. Finally, during quality assessment of the data, cal-\nibrated images with zeropoints that deviate significantly from\na reference value have the zeropoint in the header changed to\na default value and its error set to \u22123. When a default value is\nassigned all images will have the same zeropoint in the header\nregardless of the airmass at which they were observed. For ho-\nmogeneity, the default value normally adopted is the median of\nthe zeropoints reported in the trend analysis kept by either the\ntelescope team (depending on the instrument) or the internal\nEIS database. In the case of WFI, only one solution is currently\nreported on the WFI WWW pages.8\nThe derived photometric solutions were used to calibrate\nthe reduced images. The zeropoint in the header of a reduced\nimage is given by\nZP = ZP\u2032 \u2212 kX (B.1)\nwhere ZP\u2032 is the zeropoint at zero airmass (determined from\nthe linear fit as described above), k is the extinction coefficient\nand X is the airmass at which the frame was observed. Using\nthis definition the Vega magnitude can computed by\nmVega = \u22122.5 log( f ) + ZP (B.2)\nwhere f is the flux in number of counts directly measurable on\nthe image (note that the reduced images are normalized to 1 s).\n8 http:\/\/www.ls.eso.org\/lasilla\/sciops\/2p2\/E2p2M\/\nWFI\/zeropoints\/\nAppendix C: Image stacks\nMost fields are covered by more than one reduced image. These\nare co-added to create the final image product. The following\nsteps are involved in the creation of a final stacked image:\n\u2013 Grouping: reduced images are grouped into stacking\nblocks (SBs) according to position (with a minimum dis-\ntance between centers of 0.25 times the field-of-view), and\nfilter.\n\u2013 Validation: as the co-addition is carried out in pixel space\nit is required that all images have been warped to the same\nreference grid. Therefore, images in a SB must share the\nsame reference grid (projection, reference position, pixel\nscale and orientation). In addition, the images contribut-\ning to an SB, or their original RBs, are checked to ensure\nthat they appear only once in the SB. Images in the SB are\nalso checked to ensure that their flux scale has been prop-\nerly normalized to 1 s, and if not they are re-normalized\naccordingly.\n\u2013 Constraints: images in an SB are checked to ensure that\nthey meet certain constraints, for instance on the value of\nseeing, the rms of the PSF distortion and grade. In addition,\nthe contributing images to an SB, or their original RBs, are\nchecked to prevent the repetition of raw exposures. Images\nnot satisfying the constraints are discarded from the SB.\n\u2013 PSF homogenization: all images in the SB are convolved by\na Gaussian with a FWHM corresponding to the the largest\nvalue computed for the contributing images.\n\u2013 Flux scale determination: before the images can be co-\nadded, which is done using a weighted mean procedure, it\nis necessary to have all images at the same flux level. This\nis done by scaling photometric frames to zero airmass using\nthe extinction coefficients from the photometric solutions.\nThe non-photometric frames are scaled to the zero airmass\nlevel of the photometric frames (see below).\n\u2013 Co-addition: images in a validated SB are co-added us-\ning a weighted mean. The weight images reflect the expo-\nsure times of their associated science image. Therefore, the\nweight of each image is a combination of exposure time\nand noise. However, the weight images also contain infor-\nmation about the location of bad pixels and masks which\nare set to zero weight and thus do not contribute to the final\nimage. In the co-addition process, performed by the rou-\ntine add-mosaic of the EIS\/MVM library, a sigma-clipping\nprocedure is employed to remove cosmic ray hits.\nThe image co-addition uses a weighted mean combination. The\nweighting is done with the weight images produced by the im-\nage reduction. Additionally, a thresholding procedure is em-\nployed to remove cosmic rays. In general, the use of weight\nmaps and cosmic ray hits removal produces very clean final\nimages.\nAs mentioned above, all images in an SB have to be scaled\nto a common flux level before the co-addition to assure the pho-\ntometric calibration of the final, stacked image. For this rescal-\ning, one has to consider two cases:\n1. SB with at least one photometric frame \u2013 In this case the\nreference flux level is obtained from the combination of\nJ. P. Dietrich et al.: ESO imaging survey: optical follow-up of 12 selected XMM-Newton fields, Online Material p 5\nall contributing photometric frames. First, all photomet-\nrically calibrated frames are scaled to the flux level that\nwould have been obtained at zero airmass. This is done\nusing the extinction coefficients of their respective photo-\nmetric solutions. Second, by computing a weighted aver-\nage of all scaled images a reference image is created. For\nthe final co-addition all input images (photometric and non-\nphotometric) are scaled to the flux level of the reference\nimage. The scaling factors are determined by comparing\nobject magnitudes. Naturally, in cases where only one pho-\ntometric frame is available, this one is used as the reference.\n2. SB with no photometric frames \u2013 Occasionally, none of\nthe reduced images in an SB are photometrically calibrated\n(e.g. no standards were observed in the night, observations\nin non-photometric nights). In such cases, all images are\nscaled to the flux level of an arbitrarily chosen reference im-\nage from the SB. The zeropoint of the final stacked image is\nthen the zeropoint of the adopted reference image. The ze-\nropoint of the output image is that of the arbitrarily chosen\nreference. These frames can be identified by the negative\nzeropoint error assigned to these cases, as described above.\nAppendix D: Catalog production\nThe final processing step in the EIS Data Reduction system\nis the creation of source catalogs by standardized procedures,\nresulting in catalogs containing enough information to be di-\nrectly usable for scientific applications. Here the production of\ncatalogs for deep, sparse fields is discussed. The production of\ncatalogs for crowded fields, which are not included in this re-\nlease, will be described in Zaggia et al. (2005, in preparation).\nThe EIS catalog production is based on SExtractor (Bertin\n& Arnouts 1996) and a common configuration file for all cat-\nalogs with a minimum number of adjustments to be made for\nindividual images. For each image the appropriate values for\nthe seeing and magnitude zeropoints as well as the weight-map\nassociated to each image are used. Other parameters are the\nsame for all catalogs.\nThe catalog production starts with a very low S\/N catalog,\nwhich contains a large number of spurious objects. To produce\na science-grade catalog a number of steps are taken. First, the\ncatalog is pruned for objects with a S\/N (determined from the\nMAGERR_AUTO) below a user-defined level, which was set\nto 5 for this release. The object magnitudes are converted to the\nAB system according to the response function of the optical\nsystem and corrected for galactic extinction. At present, this\ncorrection is applied to the magnitudes of all objects, including\nstars. To facilitate the use of the catalogs 14 flags are added for\neach object as described below.\nThe saturation level of the final image stack is difficult to\ndetermine from the input images due to variations in integra-\ntion time and possibly seeing. Therefore, the saturation level\nis determined from the extracted catalog. The method is based\non the FWHM and peak flux of bright objects. The distribu-\ntion of the FWHM is determined and sigma-clipped to exclude\nbright galaxies from the sample. Among the remaining objects\nthose with FWHM deviating more than 3\u03c3 are taken to be the\nsaturated objects. The saturation level is set to the minimum\npeak value among these objects. This value is used to set the\nsaturation flag.\nTo be able to remove objects close to bright stars masks\ncan be created in two ways: by an automatic routine or by hand\nusing a Skycat plug-in. The automatic masking adds masks\naround saturated objects as well as around objects brighter\nthan a user-specified magnitude. The size of the mask scales\nwith the major-axis of the object, as computed by SExtractor.\nThe scaling factor is specified by the user. The adopted shape\nof the masks is a square with one of the diagonals oriented\nNorth-South in an attempt to mask the diffraction spikes. The\nparameters used in the mask definition are reported in the prod-\nuct log. The positions of all masks are reported in the MASKS\ntable in the catalog.\nNote that except for objects with S\/N less than that re-\nquired, no object is removed from the catalog. If necessary,\nmore objects can be pruned by the user according to the flags\ndescribed below. In addition, the default magnitude system\nadopted for the objects can be changed using the information\navailable in the FIELDS table.\nThe catalogs produced by the EIS Data Reduction system\nare in FITS format, based on the \u201cLeiden Data Center\u201d (LDAC)\nconvention originally adopted by the DENIS project and later\nexpanded in the course of the EIS project. It currently consists\nof a FITS header and the following tables: FIELDS, OBJECTS,\nMASK, and FILTER.\nThe FIELDS table contains general information for all ob-\njects in the catalogs. It consists of 109 columns including:\n(1) basic information set by the LDAC library; (2) keywords\ntaken from the FITS header of the image from which the cat-\nalog was extracted; (3) the main SExtractor configuration pa-\nrameters used; and (4) information computed by the EIS Data\nReduction system. The latter includes, for instance:\n\u2013 the diameter of the 10 apertures used for aperture magni-\ntudes, ranging from 1\u2032\u2032 to 5\u2032\u2032 in steps of 0.\u2032\u20325 and a large\naperture of 10\u2032\u2032;\n\u2013 the WCS coordinates of the corners of the original image\nand of the trimmed area;\n\u2013 the extinction correction. This is computed as the average\nof the value of the extinction in cells of 3 \u2032 \u00d7 3\u2032, distributed\nover the trimmed image;\n\u2013 the value added to the original magnitude of the extracted\nobjects in the Vega system to produce the reported magni-\ntudes in the catalog in the AB system;\n\u2013 an estimate of the fudge factor used to multiply the errors\nreported by SExtractor to correct for the correlated noise\nintroduced by the re-sampling kernel;\n\u2013 total and trimmed areas.\nSome of the information contained in the FIELDS table is also\navailable in the Product Logs which are available on the EIS\nXMM-Newton follow-up survey release pages.\nThe OBJECTS table reports the parameters characterizing\nthe individual extracted objects as computed by SExtractor. It\nhas 69 columns, some being vectors (e.g. aperture magnitudes),\ndescribing the main geometric and photometric properties of\nthe objects. The parameters were chosen as a compromise be-\ntween the total number of parameters and the most frequently\nJ. P.

The choice\nof apertures and the flags defined are the result of sugges-\ntions made by users of EIS data products. In addition to the\nSExtractor flag, which are described in the SExtractor manual,\n14 other flags have been defined to facilitate the filtering of the\ncatalogs. These are\n\u2013 FLAG_SEX1\u2013FLAG_SEX128 \u2013 8 flags individually repre-\nsenting the various SExtractor flag components;\n\u2013 FLAG_SAT \u2013 set to 1 if the object is saturated;\n\u2013 FLAG_TRIM \u2013 set to 1 if the object is inside a trimmed area;\n\u2013 FLAG_MASK \u2013 set to 1 if the object is inside a masked area;\n\u2013 EISFLAG \u2013 sum of FLAG_TRIM and FLAG_MASK\n\u2013 FLAG_STATE \u2013 1 if any of the above flags are set\n\u2013 FLAG_STAR \u2013 1 if star, 0 if galaxy, based on SExtractor\u2019s\nCLASS_STAR parameter. The value used for separation\nand the magnitude down to which a classification was at-\ntempted are reported in the product log.\nThe MASK table gives the number and coordinates of the ver-\ntices of both automatically created masks as well as those\ndrawn by hand using a Skycat plug-in.\nThe FILTER table gives the filter transmission curve and\ntheir convolution with the optical system response function.\n"}
