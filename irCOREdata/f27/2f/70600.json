In this paper we argue that these current discourses and \ntheir description of \u2018talent\u2019 and the challenge of finding it fail to do full justice to the \ncomplexities of contemporary elite markets. We argue that the rise of executive search \nfirms, headhunters, as labour market intermediaries and their tactics for defining and \nmanaging contemporary elite labour recruitment practices is too often ignored. We \nshow that executive search firms control elite labour recruitment processes through \ntwo forms of power-relation: one in the labour management process where relations \nbetween clients and executive search firms are structured by power resources \nconstructed over time; and one in the labour market itself where definitions of talent \nare promulgated by search firms, thus determining who does and does not classify as \na talented individual and who is admitted to the networks that provide access to elite \nexecutive positions. Building on insights from interviews with headhunters in Europe \nwe reveal the strategies producing these positions of power. This leads us to suggest \nthat geographers need to pay more attention to the role of discourses in the \nconstruction of power relations and the role of geography as a resource that is \nempowering but also disempowering. \n \nKeywords: Executive Search; Headhunters; elite labour; knowledge economy; power  \n \n 3 \nIntroduction \n Recent years have been characterised by the increasing encroachment into \npolicy and academic debates of discourses describing knowledge (Leadbeater, 1999) \nand weightless economies (Quah, 2001). A cornerstone of such discourses is the \nimportance of flexible, talented labour as a central factor of production that maintains \nthe competitiveness of firms and places in the digital age of contemporary globalization \n(DTI, 1998; Florida, 2002; UNCTAD, 2004). This has been discussed in relation to \neconomic activities from Formula I racing (Henry and Pinch, 1999) to financial services \n(The Corporation of London, 2003) to high-technology (Saxenian, 2006). Meanwhile \nand somewhat related to this turn, Thrift (1997) has argued that the behaviour of firms \nis increasingly defined by a \u2018cultural circuit of capitalism\u2019. This is a \u201ccircuit which is now \nself-organising, is responsible for the production and distribution of managerial \nknowledge to managers. As it has grown, so have its appetites. It now has a constant \nand voracious need for new knowledge. Chief amongst the produces of the managerial \ndiscourse are three institutions: business schools, management consultants, and \nmanagement gurus\u201d (Thrift, 1997, 34). The \u2018knowledge worker\u2019 is one of the central \ncomponents of the discourses Thrift describes.   \nThe importance of executive talent perhaps became most apparent when a \ngroup from management consultants McKinsey & Co. produced a report in which they \ndeclared that there was \u2018A war for talent\u2019 (see Michaels et al., 2001). The future \nsuccess of firms was, according to this report, set to be defined by the ability to find, \nrecruit and retain the most talented executives who could provide inspirational \nleadership and drive innovation and ultimately profitability in a knowledge-based \neconomy. As a result more and more interest has developed in the dynamics of elite \nlabour markets. Fortune Magazine (2006) reported in an article entitled, \u2018Resurgence \nof the war for talent\u2019 that management consultants have warned businesses that \u201c77% \n 4 \nof companies say they don\u2019t have enough successor to their current senior managers \n[and] the talent shortage will probably get worse. The allure of being a corporate \nexecutive may be fading\u201d. On the surface, then, the message is clear: the main \nchallenge for the firm in contemporary elite labour markets is finding talent because \n\u201cthe world\u2019s most valuable commodity is getting harder to find\u201d (Economist, 2006, 11). \n In this paper we argue that the current discourses that describe \u2018talent\u2019 and the \nchallenge of finding it fail to do full justice to the complexities of contemporary elite \nmarkets. We argue that the rise of executive search firms, headhunters, as labour \nmarket intermediaries and their tactics for defining and managing contemporary elite \nlabour recruitment practices is too often ignored. This is significant in a process-related \nsense because headhunters have manufactured themselves a position of power in \nelite labour recruitment that allows them to actively regulate labour markets. It is also \nsignificant because the activities of headhunters are integral to defining the nature of \n\u2018talent\u2019 in the contemporary economy.  \n In developing this argument we conceptualise contemporary elite labour \nrecruitment as a network process and, by drawing on earlier descriptions of the old \nboys network (Michie, 1991) and embedded networks of weak ties (Grannovetter, \n1993), argue that executive search firms act as new and powerful governance agents \nin the networks that influence the present-day movement of talent. Taking inspiration \nfrom Grabher\u2019s (2006) recent intervention that highlights the importance of recognising \ngovernance forces in networks, allows us to show that executive search firms control \nelite labour recruitment processes through two forms of power-relation: one in the \nlabour management process where relations between clients and executive search \nfirms are structured by power resources constructed over time; and one in the labour \nmarket itself where definitions of talent are promulgated by search firms, thus \ndetermining who does and does not classify as a talented individual and who is \n 5 \nadmitted to the networks that provide access to elite executive positions. This creates \na situation that is reminiscent of the exclusive and powerful elite networks of labour \nrecruitment of the past, something missing in discourses that suggest \u2018open\u2019 and \nmeritocratic elite labour markets in the contemporary knowledge economy where \nfinding talent is the main problem. Building on these points and examination of the way \nheadhunters develop the resources that create these positions of power allows us to \ndevelop a theoretical argument about the importance of, first, discursive strategies in \nthe engineering of an exclusive role for headhunters in elite labour recruitment \nprocesses; and, second, the significance of geographically inscribed power relations in \nwhich geography can act as an empowering and disempowering resource.  \nThe rest of the paper develops these arguments as follows. After this \nintroduction we provide a discussion of the symbiotic, entangled and reproductive \nrelationship between elite labour markets and executive search firms, thus teasing out \nthe \u2018pure\u2019 intermediary influence of headhunters.  We then conceptualise this process \nas producing a \u2018new boys network\u2019 that influences elite labour recruitment. The \nempirical section then draws upon interviews conducted with 50 executive search \nresearchers and consultants in 21 of the leading executive search firms in Europe and \nthe professional bodies representing these firms. Interviews took place between June \n2006 and March 2007 in Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, London, and Paris and, with \nthe exception of one interview, were all recorded and fully transcribed. Interviewees \nranged from the most senior executives (often the founders of a firm) to mid-ranking \npartners and junior researchers. A member of the project team also attended the \nAssociation of Executive Search Consultants Annual Researchers Conference in \nLondon in September 2006 and the same organisation\u2019s Annual European Conference \nin Frankfurt in November 2006. This allowed participation in and observation of \ndiscussions about the industry. The analysis presented is based on insights from these \n 6 \ndatasets into the way firms have gone about manufacturing their position as labour \nmarket intermediaries in the European context and the way candidates are assessed \nand geographically \u2018categorised\u2019 by firms as part of the search and selection process. \nThis allows us to show that executive search firms use their power and geographical \nknowledge to reproduce their own position of power in elite labour markets and the \npowerful positions of others, something which suggests elite labour markets are \nhierarchically governed and a modern replication of traditional \u2018old boys\u2019 (sic) networks. \nThe concluding section considers the significance of these findings in relation to \ndebates about power as well as elite labour mobility. \n \nElite labour markets and Executive Search firms   \n The emergence of the idea that talent and \u2018knowledge workers\u2019 are the drivers \nof economic success can be attributed to two significant changes in the economy over \nthe past fifty years. First, and most structurally, has been the changing role of the so-\ncalled \u2018developed\u2019 nations in the global economy (see Dicken, 2007; Massey, 1995). \nThe initial rise of low-skilled manufacturing activities in \u2018developing\u2019 countries and more \nrecently research and development activities in the first-wave newly industrialised \nnations has led to calls for countries with long-histories of manufacturing to \u2018move up \nthe value chain\u2019 and focus upon knowledge-intensive industries (DTI, 1998). Related to \nthis, the rapid emergence of post-industrial economies in the \u2018developed\u2019 world, \ncharacterised by rapid growth in producer and consumer services (Bryson, Daniels \nand Warf, 2003) and high-value technological industries (Saxenian, 2006), has fuelled \nthe global demand for executive and highly-specialised, elite labour. This is particularly \ntrue in places like the global cities (Sassen, 2001), international financial centres \n(Beaverstock, 2006) and technological clusters (Saxenian, 2006).  This emergence of \nnew service and technological industries has, at the same time, created the conditions \n 7 \nfor global elite labour markets as worldwide demand is fuelled by new types of senior \nleadership, scientific and fee-earning occupations which didn\u2019t exist ten or twenty years \nago (Jones, 1989).  For example, in an industry like accounting, diversification over a \ntwenty year period has changed the audit dominated labour market, to one of audit \nand corporate finance, taxation, consulting and, even executive search (Beaverstock, \n2007).  \nSecond, what might be called the neo-liberalising of labour markets has led to a \nreadjustment in the behaviours of employers and employees alike (Herod, 2000; Peck, \n1996).  This process, which has bitten most in the past two decades, has multiple \nfacets that we cannot fully explore here. Most significant for our argument, however, is \nthe effect on labour mobility. An important tenet of neo-liberal policies is free labour \nmarkets and unrestrictive labour regulations in which responsibility for success lies \nwith the individual rather than the state or their employer. As Finlay and Coverdill \n(2000) argue, since the late 1970s in the USA and more recently the UK and other \nparts of Europe and the world, one effect of this has been the weakening of ties \nbetween employers and employees1. This is a result of both the growing ability and \nwillingness of employers to dismiss workers and at the same time an increasing \nwillingness of employees to change jobs frequently so as to progress their career. This \nhas often replaced the \u2018job for life\u2019 culture, although variants of this do still exist in a \nnumber of countries. Consequently the idea of the \u2018internal labour market\u2019, where firms \npromote to the leadership ranks from within, has withered with, instead, the worldwide \n                                                 \n1\n Of course, it is important to note that this change has been geographically variegated and has taken \nplace at different paces in different countries (Peck, 1996). Indeed it could be argued that Germany and \nJapan provide two examples of countries where change has been limited (Hall and Soskice, 2001).  \n 8 \nsearch for talent becoming a major preoccupation of managers in transnational \ncorporations. \n \nFluid labour markets? \n The initial analysis of the contemporary conditions of elite labour markets would \nsuggest a geographical fluidity unhindered by regulation and favouring those with \n\u2018talent\u2019 however defined. This, we contend, is far from the case. A critique of \u2018free\u2019 \nlabour markets could be made based on a discussion of the regulatory hurdles to the \nfree movement of labour (see for example Neumayer [2006]). However, most pertinent \nin relation to our interest in executive search firms is the falsity of the neo-liberal \nmarket ideal of buyers and sellers (employers and employees) negotiating in a free \nand open markets. A number of important labour intermediaries have emerged, with \ntemping agencies at the \u2018bottom\u2019 unskilled end of the market (Peck and Theodore, \n2001; Peck et al. 2005; Ward, 2004) and executive search at the \u2018top\u2019, elite skilled end \nof the market (Faulconbridge et al., 2008; Finlay and Coverdill, 2000; Jenn, 2005). It is \nwork on temping that has provided the seminal contribution to our understanding of \nthis phenomenon and its implications for labour market dynamics.        \n      As Peck and Theodore (2001, 476) discuss, temp agencies as intermediaries in \nlabour markets are \u201cboth an orchestrator and a beneficiary of the explosion in \ncontingent employment\u201d. In the context of our discussions here this means \u201ctemp \nagencies are more than passive beneficiaries of these trends in industrial \n(re)organization. They actively shape the growth in contingent labor through their role \ncontrolling virtues of workforce flexibility\u201d (Peck and Theodore, 2001, 477). Such \nintermediaries have, then, engineered themselves a space in neo-liberal labour \nmarkets and now fulfil a role that, whilst unanticipated in a perfect market scenario, is \nincredibly powerful. As Theodore and Peck (2002) note, the strategy of these agencies \n 9 \nis innately geographical, reconstituting itself so that firms can become embedded in \ndifferent cities and states are operate effectively. Indeed, Ward (2004) documents how \ntemp agencies have also successfully proliferated and adapted both the logic of \ncontingent labour but also their intermediary role as part of an internationalisation \nprocess that has produced ever-growing demand in countries outside of the US and \nUK heartlands of leading firms.  \n We make a similar argument here in relation to executive search firms but in \ndoing so refer to the opposite end of the market \u2013 elite, permanent labour (which we \ndefine further below) \u2013 and focus specifically on: (a) the new power relations \nassociated with the emergence and legitimation of search firms; and (b) the effects of \nheadhunters new governance role on definitions of and the mobility of \u2018talented\u2019 elite \nlabour. \n \nElite labour markets, executive search firms and power-laden networks \n Here we take elite labour to be defined as workers fulfilling positions at the \npinnacles of organizational hierarchies (e.g. chief executives, chief financial officers) or \nspecialist skilled roles (e.g. in the oil and gas industry; Chinese equity analysts; \nresearch and development scientists in particular niches of the bio-tech sector etc). \nExecutive search firms distinguish themselves from temping agencies and other \nsearch agencies through their focus upon the locating and recruiting of such elite \nlabour (table 1 notes the major global players in the industry). Rather than acting on a \ncontingent basis like many temp agencies and middle-management recruiters do \n(payment of completion of task) retained executive search firms set their fees in \nadvance, usually demanding payment of fifty percent up front and fifty percent at the \nend of the project (Jones, 1989). This typically means a fee of equivalent to one third \nof the first year salary of the recruited executive. These firms never work on projects \n 10 \nwhere the minimum first year salary of a candidate is below \u00a3100,000 (Jenn, 2005). \nHence salary ultimately defines elite labour in the eyes of these firms.  \nBy 2004, Jenn (2005) estimates that the executive search industry\u2019s revenues \nwere worth US$2,500m. Many of the firms are partnerships and as such do not publish \ndetails of annual turnovers. However selective self reporting of turnover by firms and \nproxy measures such as office numbers can be used to reveal impressive growth in \nthe industry throughout the 1990s. For example, between 1980 and 2006 the number \nof European offices of the fifty largest international firms grew from 50 to 871 \n(Beaverstock et al., 2006). Most of this growth took place, however, between 1990 and \n2000 since when a recovery and reorientation period has been necessary to offset the \ndamage caused by the dot.com bust. For example, one of the leading firms, Korn \nFerry, saw revenue grow from US$315m in 2000 to only US$328m in 2005 (Executive \nGrapevine, 2000; 2005). \n \n[Insert table 1 here] \n \nThe \u2018headhunting\u2019 practice of these firms itself has been described in detail \nelsewhere (Finlay and Coverdill, 2000; Jenn, 2005). Here, then, we focus solely on the \nelements most pertinent to our argument. As a result of the desire to transform the \nexecutive search industry into a scientific activity, a number of business processes \nhave emerged which are designed to make the whole search and selection activity \ntransparent and methodological rigorous in line with new risk cultures (Beck, 1992). \nThe chronology of the search process can thus be characterised as follows:  \n \n 11 \n\u2022 Mapping the market \u2013 using a researcher and consultant\u2019s knowledge and \ncontacts to list competing firms where suitable candidates could be found and \nseek out background information and contacts for these individuals. \n\u2022 Using the firm\u2019s database to search for suitable candidates. \n\u2022 Sourcing \u2013 using known contacts and individuals in the firm\u2019s database to elicit \nrecommendations for possible candidates. \n \nThese strategies of the modern-day headhunter produce the networks that define elite \nlabour recruitment. In order to be successful in elite labour markets candidates need to \nbe known to search consultants and\/or part of their database and\/or connected to \nindividuals connected to headhunters. Of course, it is not particularly new to suggest \nelite labour mobility involves negotiating a power-laden network. The origins of the \nsuggestion can be traced back to the idea of the \u2018old boy network\u2019 in the City of \nLondon and the way school and club ties and family nepotism determined the career \npath of an individual (Leyshon and Thrift, 1997; Michie, 1999). Indeed, one of the main \ndiscourses associated with the war for talent has been the need to destroy such \nnetworks because of their inefficiencies and inability to recruit the \u2018best\u2019 talent (Jones, \n1989). Granovetter (1983) similarly described how the \u2018strength of weak ties\u2019 and the \nnetwork social capital of an individual was instrumental in finding a job in the 1970s. \nAgain, recent developments such as the Internet have challenged the foundations of \nthis argument, with forms of search and network formation that were impossible in the \npast now enabled by new technologies. Yet our research suggests that hierarchical, \nrestrictive network practices have actually been reproduced in contemporary elite \nlabour markets because of the way executive search firms operate.  \n \n \n 12 \nConceptualising executive search firms as governance agents  \nAccording to our research, both potential candidates and headhunters continue \nto understand elite labour markets, at least in part, as sophisticated networks. This is \nmainly because recruitment still occurs through the consultant\u2019s network, something \nnow more extensive thanks to the internet and the databases of search firms, but \nsomething that is still \u2018exclusive\u2019 and in need of penetration by candidates in new and \nimportant ways. Of course, as Dicken et al. (2001) suggest, it is essential to recognise \nall networks as socio-spatial constructions, not simply as connections or pipelines. This \nmeans analysing the various actors, technologies and social, cultural and political \ninfluences upon entrance into and action within a network. In terms of our discussion \nhere, the elite labour recruitment mediated by executive search firms might be \nconceptualised as such a network because, firstly, the knowledge, databases and \nsourcing described above produce an infrastructure that creates connections between \nclients (employers) and candidates (potential employees). For candidates entrance \ninto these networks is essential. As Ibarra and Hunter (2007) argue, successful \nexecutives are defined by their ability to develop and maintain such \u2018personal\u2019 \nnetworks which can then be used to enhance their career and open doors through the \ndevelopment of new contacts and relationships. This reflects in many ways the \nstrength of weak ties that Granovetter described (1983). However, in the case of \ncontemporary elite labour networks entrance into the network also requires the \nperformance of certain idealised behaviours which are socially and culturally \nconstructed and associated with the \u2018ideal\u2019 candidate. This, then, is our second reason \nfor using the network metaphor.  \nThe \u2018model\u2019 candidate is defined and controlled by researchers and consultants \nin firms who act as gatekeepers to the network. In effect we argue that to understand \ncontemporary elite labour recruitment requires us to understand the factors influencing \n 13 \nwhether a candidate can successfully makes contact with a potential employer, \nsomething ultimately determined by whether an individual is able to acquire the \nappropriate social and cultural capital that allows them become part of and function \nwithin the headhunter\u2019s network. This, we suggest, lies at the heart of the emergence \nof the \u2018new\u2019 boy\u2019s network that is used to recruit executives in the contemporary \nknowledge economy. We understand executive search firms\u2019 roles within \u2018new\u2019 elite \nlabour networks to be, then, \u201ca specific mode of governance\u201d (Grabher 2006:167). \nGrabher claims that networks are too often viewed as somewhat benign, democratic, \ninnovative formations and that there is often a failure to theorise the full complexities of \nnetwork processes. In particular, according the Grabher, recognition of the way \nnetworks can be exclusive and restrictive is needed. \u201cNotions like the tertius gaudens \n(the third who benefits) and \u2018structural equivalence\u2019 [that] exemplify the critical role of \nnetwork position and structure and fundamentally depart from the cohesion-fixated \nideas of networks\u201d (Grabher, 2006, 165).  \nThe cases of elite labour market networks and the governing role of \nheadhunters help to develop this argument by fleshing out the way governance roles \nare defined and the power relations these roles produce. As Allen (2003) argues, \npower is a relational construct and emerges because of the practices and resources \nused to produce certain forms of relationship between individuals and groups. \nDepending on how resources such as money, ideas and technology are used, and \nimportantly how others respond to these resources, different types of power relation \nemerge. This ranges from domination (imposed power) to manipulation (power created \nthrough the concealment of intent when developing relationships). Below we show how \nexecutive search firms have effectively developed relations of authority (claimed and \nconceded power based on a willingness by others to recognise and accept control by \nan agent) that allow them to act as intermediary governance agents in elite labour \n 14 \nnetworks. This has, in some senses, parallels to Foucault\u2019s concept of governmentality \n(1991). In effect we unpack Executive search firms\u2019 \u2018art of governmentality\u2019 as they \nstrive to institutionalise their role in elite labour markets. We then also show the way \nthat the activities of headhunters provides resources to certain candidates in elite \nlabour market, rendering them dominant (power gained because of an imposed form of \nconduct\/identity) as a result of their geographical biographies and experience. \nTogether these two forms of power define the contemplator geographies of elite labour \nmarkets.  \n     \nAuthority to search: manufacturing the role of executive search firms in elite \nlabour markets \n Changing conceptions of labour market behaviour on the part of employers and \nemployees have acted as one of the most significant spurs for the development of the \nexecutive search industry. This has produced a new generation of workers that accept \nthe need to move between employers to develop their career. Similarly corporations \nare now familiar with the \u2018war for talent\u2019 this has created. As one executive search \nconsultant noted: \n\u201cIt is a generational thing, in this day and age information flows across markets so \nreadily and there is a fundamental supply and demand problem of management \ntalent all over the world\u2026the opportunity for advancement often comes in from the \nplaces where you are not, those who are sophisticated about their careers they \nunderstand how to function in this world (Consultant, Frankfurt). \nFor executive search firms this change acts as the context for the development of a \nposition of authority in elite labour recruitment networks. Like temping agencies, \nheadhunters need to be active institutional agents in the creation of their own markets \nso as to ensure demand for their services which, in a perfect market where rational \n 15 \nlogic prevails, would not be required. In order to do this, firms have adopted a number \nof interrelated strategies. \n \nPromoting discourses of complexity \nPerhaps one of the most important strategies of executive search firms has \nbeen the use and proliferation of the types of discourses outlined at the start of the \npaper. Promoting the idea that talent is scarce yet essential in order to maximise \nprofitability has allowed headhunters to effectively \u2018scare\u2019 firms into seeking support in \nthe recruitment of executives. As Kelly (2001, 722) points out, discourses can be more \nthan linguistic devices. They can also be \u201cmaterial because [they] bring into being \nclassifications of objects, bodies, identities, and so on, and exist as situated practices\u201d. \nThe discourses proliferated have acted as powerful devices for the production of the \neconomic practice of using search firms to recruit executive labour. Two ideas in \nparticular are used to manufacture a position of power for headhunters in this process.  \nFirst, executive search firms invoke ideas of risk as a tool for creating demand \nfor their services. As Beck (1992) and others (e.g. Drori and Meyer, 2006) have shown, \nrisk management is now central to life both within and without of the corporate world. \nThe so-called risks associated with finding elite labour in the \u2018war for talent\u2019 are \ncoupled to the growing political interest in corporate governance issues following the \nscandals that rocked corporate America in the early 2000s and the subsequent \nimplementation in the USA of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002 legitimating \nheadhunters\u2019 roles. In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act highlighted and regulated for \nthe first time issues associated with conflicts of interest and the use of \u2018favours\u2019 in the \nappointment of particularly senior staff, something that resulted in new demands from \ncapital markets in relation to the recruitment of executives. Investors and large pension \nfunds expect firms to prove that they have minimised the risks associated with \n 16 \nappointing a new chief executive or chief financial officer. Consequently, the \u2018old boys \nnetwork\u2019 has now been comprehensively dismissed as a flawed strategy for \nrecruitment and executive search firms have put themselves forward as the new best-\npractice for elite labour recruitment. As one interviewee responded when asked why \nclients appoint headhunters: \n\u201cTo minimise risk. If you appoint someone who is know to the chairman, if you pop an \nadvert in the Sunday Times and you take the best out of the 200 people that apply you \nare not necessarily getting the best person to do the job. If you work with an executive \nsearch firm you can really do a proper audit, you can really make certain that you have \nthe absolute best person to do that job and, therefore, the risk for the corporation is \nmuch much less\u201d (Consultant, London). \nThere is, of course, little evidence that appointing a headhunter actually reduces the \nrisk of the recruitment process. However, the use of the type of rhetoric described \nabove has effectively institutionalised executive search firms as risk-management \nagents. Indeed, so successful has this been that, as a different interviewee noted: \n\u201cThe Higgs Report says that if you don\u2019t use a headhunter to recruit in public  \ncompanies for a non executive directives you should explain why you didn\u2019t in your \nannual report, so that has created a new stream of business\u201d (Consultant, London)\n 2\n.     \nSecond, and building on the ideas discussed in the opening section of the paper, \nexecutive search firms are keen to promote the enormity of the challenge of finding \nand then recruiting skilled executives. The combination of both the globalisation of the \nsearch for elite labour and paradoxically the information over-load created by the \nInternet that now allows anyone to find hundreds of potential candidates through \nrelatively simply searches has, according to headhunters, makes the task of finding \n                                                 \n2\n The Higgs report, commissions by the UK government, examined the effectiveness of non-executive \ndirectors and the most appropriate way to recruit individuals who would champion shareholders interests. \n 17 \nelite labour impossible for unskilled individuals. This means both existing executives \nbut also human resources departments cannot manage the task effectively. As one \ninterviewee claimed: \n\u201ca very thorough search procedure is quite painstaking, it does take a lot of time and I \ndon\u2019t think management today is in such a position to invest that much time. In my days \nyou used to put an add in the paper, get 150 replies, you then interviewed \u2013 imagine \nnow how much management capacity you are freezing with that, when you look at the \nactual hours and what you are doing to your organization it is crazy. So it is pure time, \nso you say let an expert deal with it\u2026we provide a broader background, we have the \ndistance, we can look at multiple aspects \u2013 and we have a network they don\u2019t have \nbecause this is all we do, that\u2019s our job, that\u2019s our living\u201d (Consultant, London). \nBecause of the immensity of the challenge posed by this new \u2018market\u2019 for elite labour, \nheadhunters are also keen to highlight the need for skill, expertise and most \nsignificantly experience in order to effectively seek out and obtain the services of the \nmost appropriate executives. As one consultant put it: \n\u201cif you are recruiting a finance director for example, a finance director probably lasts \nfive or six years in the job, the chances are that the HR department has never recruited \na finance director, I\u2019ve got somebody here who recruits 25 finance directors a year, \nfinding the right finance director is business critical, why on earth give than job to \nsomeone who has never done it. Look what is the most important thing for nearly every \norganisation, its having the right people in the top jobs, if you haven\u2019t got that you\u2019re \nstuffed aren\u2019t you and if you have then you will be alright, it is the thing that matters. \nYou ask your lawyer to advise you on law, you ask your accountant to advise you on \nfinance it would be extraordinary not to let somebody advise you on recruiting, what an \nextraordinary thing to do in house. What is so odd is that people still do do it, they\u2019re \nbonkers\u201d (Consultant, London). \n 18 \nBy drawing on these strategies that are founded on the discourses of talent and the \nknowledge economy described in the opening of the paper, search firms are effectively \nclosing-off the market for elite labour recruitment. Headhunters claim to be the only \npeople with the high-levels of expertise needed to find talent, something that produces \na new and powerful logic that informs recruitment practices. As potential clients seem \nto have accepted this logic and have become enrolled into the idea that headhunters \nare the only way to recruit executives, search firms have developed powerful positions \nin executive labour markets. Using this as a starting point, firms then use the various \n\u2018technologies\u2019 at their disposal as resources to further consolidate this position. \n \nTechnologies of simplification \nThe database.  The use of the firm\u2019s own database is seen as a key starting \npoint in identifying potential candidates. For headhunters the database is much more \nthan just a data-mining tool. Rather it is used to identify the existing \u2018stars\u2019 and known-\ncontacts holding the position the client wants to fill. This allows researchers and \nconsultants to both identify the prime candidates for the vacancy but also set the \nparameters for the search in terms of the \u2018type\u2019 of candidate that might fit the position \nbeing filled. As one interviewee noted: \n\u201cFrequently we can use [the database] to spark ideas, we don\u2019t think of the \ndatabase as a source of candidates as much as a source of authorities in a given \narea, to give us a view on who the stars are in a given sector and that can help us \nwhen we make an approach to an individual\u201d (Consultant, London). \nThese databases are also linked to what is known in the sector as \u2018sourcing\u2019. \nSourcing is a process of identifying individuals holding the same position as the \nvacancy to be filled but in another firm and then, assuming they are not \n 19 \ninterested in the job, infiltrating their networks as a source of recommendations \nfor potential candidates.  So as one consultant put it: \n\u201cThe database is not for identifying candidates\u2026Sourcing is the real link with the \nspecialisation because you start to think who are the actors on the market, then \nyou not only start to find candidates but you also try to get information from a \ncertain number of people, they may not be interested but they may know \nsomeone\u201d (Consultant, Paris), \nIn promotional rhetorics the \u2018power\u2019 of these databases is always also couched \nalongside the firms\u2019 second main resource.  \nThe researcher and consultant. Perhaps one of the main evolutions in recent \ntimes in the discourses of executive search firms has been the emergence of a client-\nservice ethos. This has centred upon the value-added delivered by consultants and \ntheir teams of researchers beyond providing a list of potential candidates. Importantly, \none strategy has been to play up the ways in which the contemporary service offered \nby headhunters is very different to that offered in the past. As one interviewee put it, \u201cI \nthink we have changed, we have become more professional, we are more organised \nwe are more professional than we used to be, but also certain segments of society are \nbecoming more sophisticated, more receptive to working with consultants, could be \nNGOs could be universities could be schools\u201d (Consultant, Brussels).  \n This \u2018relational\u2019 tactic of marking-out the contemporary headhunter as different \nto the \u2018old boy\u2019, rolodex generation was an important ploy used by all of those \ninterviewed. Moreover, heavy reference was often made to the \u2018knowledge rich\u2019 and \n\u2018bespoke\u2019 nature of services offered to clients. As part of this self-promotion \nconsultants and researchers were keen to point out that, beyond identifying technically \nqualified candidates, they are skilled at convincing an individual to consider and then \naccept a position, even when they may not be looking to move firms. The scarcity of \n 20 \ntalent is made worse, or so headhunters would have you believe, because the best \ncandidates are often unwilling to move organisation let alone countries, as is often \nnecessary. Consultants claim to have the experience and tacit skill that can convince a \nseemingly uninterested candidate to look at a vacancy. As one researcher described \nthis salesman-like skill in relation to the challenges of dealing with an individual\u2019s \nnervousness at superiors finding out he\/she was considering another job: \n\u201cSometimes if you ring someone and they haven\u2019t been headhunted they think that \ntheir boss as given you their name and they are really paranoid that somebody has \ngiven them their name because they are going to be ousted of the company so you \nhave to reassure them that nobody has told you that you are looking, it is just an \nopportunity, you don\u2019t have to listen or even read the information but it is an opportunity \nso why not have a look at it, so you can persuade people but generally the more senior \nthe individual the more they get it\u201d (Researcher, London). \nTogether, the \u2018technologies\u2019 of the database and the skills and expertise of researchers \nand consultants act as resources that are used in discourses to reinforce the authority \nof executive search firms as the only way to find and recruit elite talent. This has been \ncritical to the proliferation of the market for executive search outside of the USA in the \npast twenty years and means that these firms now have a powerful position in elite \nlabour markets in many countries4. In terms of our conceptualisation of elite labour \n                                                 \n4\n This does, of course, point to the interesting question about the geographical variability in the success \nof search firms in developing this authority. Interviews revealed that this varied between the case-study \ncountries and the this authority often did not exist outside of Western Europe and North America. This, \nhowever, is a discussion for another paper and is not central to our argument here about elite labour \nnetworks.  \n 21 \nmarkets as networks it means the search firms have been able to engineere \nthemselves a governance role in existing networks, disintermediating candidates and \nemployers and requiring both parties to follow the rules of the game set-down by \nheadhunters. These rules, whilst promoted as being beneficial for all involved, might \nnot, however, always have benign effects on the geographies of elite labour \nrecruitment. In particular, as we argue below, the powerful position of executive search \nfirms seems to be leading to the emergence of what we term a \u2018new\u2019 boys network in \nwhich talent is assessed and defined in part at least by geographical biographies. This \nleads to the domination of a certain type of geographical-marked \u2018ideal type\u2019 executive, \nan unintentional consequence perhaps of the war for talent and executive search firms\u2019 \ngovernance role in elite labour markets.   \n \nDomination through geography: the ideal-type executive \nIn order for executive search firms to deal with the complexities of finding \u2018talent\u2019 \nresearchers and consultants develop heuristic models of \u2018ideal\u2019 candidates for top \nexecutive jobs. Here we do not attempt to differentiate between the skills or \ncharacteristics needed by executives in different positions (e.g. a chief executive of a \nlarge manufacturing corporation versus a head of human resources for an international \nbank). Instead, we focus upon some of the common characteristics that cut-across \nsectoral specificities.  \nIn particular, because clients are often transnational corporations themselves, \nthere is often a desire to recruit a \u2018global elite\u2019, someone who would fit in what Sklair \n(2001) describes as a transnational capitalist class. Indeed, even clients operating in \nonly one country often want a \u2018worldly\u2019 executive that can bring with them experience \nfrom multiple countries. Consequently, as one interviewee put it: \n 22 \n\u201cWhen you speak about recruitment at a certain level you don\u2019t look local. Most of \nour assignments now are pan-European, we don\u2019t look for a candidate only in \nFrance, there is no difference from a German, an Italian, British with experience \nworking in France, they will have an international background. Our biggest \ncustomer is looking form members of their steering committee to come from \nabroad, not being French. To be on this international level you need to have a \nmulticultural team, because plenty of their subsidiaries are abroad\u201d (Consultant, \nParis).  \nThis does not, however, mean that any individual with experience of working in \nmultiple countries will automatically catch the attention of the headhunter. Criteria, \nwhich we outline in detail below, are used by both researchers and consultants to \ndetermine whether an individual ever enters the headhunter\u2019s database. This is \nsignificant as it suggests that the labour recruitment networks headhunters govern can \nonly be entered when certain social, cultural and geographical knowledges and \npractices are gained and performed. In effect, for many executives the chance of \ngetting a phone call from a headhunter is determined both by technical ability to do the \njob but also by key geographical markers on their curriculum vitae.  \n \nThe geographically inscribed candidate \nWe have already described the importance of international mobility in marking out a \nleading executive. However this needs to be a carefully targeted mobility. As one \nconsultant put it \u201cif your business is an international one then you want people with \nexposure of that whether they are from within the UK or elsewhere, so you need that, \nyou want them to bring that set of experiences, but frequently there are quite specific \ngeographies\u201d (Consultant, London). In particular, work experience in the UK and\/or \n 23 \nUSA and other \u2018hot-spots\u2019 of the global economy is an essential criterion in most \nsituations. As one researcher described: \n\u201cFrankly it is much more often the case that somebody from outside comes to \nGermany, so we hire somebody from the US or the UK or France, it depends upon \nthe career history of somebody, so you would never hire a pure Germany who has \nstudied in Germany, worked in Germany and never lived abroad, the candidates \nwe are interested in they are international, they are German yes but they did an \nMBA in the US, they lived for 3 years in Asia so you wouldn\u2019t regard them as being \nGerman\u201d (Researcher, Frankfurt).  \nWe return to the point made about education below. First though it is important to \nfurther unpick the geographical markers of an attractive mobile executive. \nUnsurprisingly, language is also another issue and as one interviewee described, \u201cWe \nare working on a search at the moment looking for head of one of the big design \nhouses, and we found out one the candidates couldn\u2019t speak English so that was the \nend of her, if you can\u2019t speak English you can\u2019t be headhunted\u201d (Researcher, London). \nSpeaking English means being fluent in the language, something that almost inevitably \nmeans having worked in an English speaking country for a period of time. This again \ninscribes a geography onto the ideal candidate. Moreover, depending on the client, the \nideal candidate will usually have also worked in one or several of the \u2018hotspots\u2019 of an \nindustry. For finance this means London or New York. For information technology \nSilicon Valley. For oil one of the Gulf States or West Africa. Without experience in one \nof these places an individual is seen as lacking the necessary knowledge but also \nintuition gained from experience of these key marketplaces.  \nIn addition and as already highlighted above, the reification of the ideal candidate \nhas led to a distinct homogeneity in terms of educational expectations. This is true both \nin terms of undergraduate and postgraduate education with two markers of the ideal-\n 24 \ntype candidate. First, a degree from a prestigious university. This means an institution \nlisted in the top echelons of one of the many league tables such as Newsweek\u2019s World \nUniversity Rankings. Second, for a position in business, an individual must usually \nhave an MBA, again from a leading university and preferably a university in the USA or \nUK. As one interviewee described these two dynamics:   \n\u201cHaving an MBA because more and more people have degrees and second \ndegrees so there has to be things that differentiate and if you are being very elitist \nabout this then going to Oxbridge\u201d (Researcher, London). \nPerhaps one complication here is nationally-specific snobbery associated with \neducational qualifications. So, for example, one consultant suggested that the French \nhad a slightly different attitude with French qualifications being privileged. As he put it: \n\u201cif you are speaking about classical European markets like France, you need not \nonly be based in Paris, you need a French network that is typical to the French, a \nsocial organisation, so you have to have graduated from a nice business school, \nyou need to have been in some civil servant position before\u201d (Consultant, Paris).  \nHere we see a less international perspective but still the continuation of geographically \ninscribed characteristics in the sense of having studied in the \u2018right\u2019 place. When \ncombined with the mobility dynamics described above, a clear geography begins to \nemerge of the ideal candidate. This is an individual with international experience in the \nleading commercial or industry centres of the world. They will have spent time in the \nUK or USA and will have been educated at one of a handful of elite institutions \nthroughout the world.  \nIn addition, individuals will also know how to \u2018be in the right place\u2019. The \u2018right \nplace\u2019 refers to the right social networks and social spaces in which headhunters seek \nout potential candidates. The strength of weak ties continues. This means having \nmembership of relevant professional associations and attending their social events and \n 25 \na wider social circuit of charity evenings and launch parties. As one consultant \ncommented about his tactics for spotting candidates, \u201cI have membership of 6 or 7 \nmedical societies, and I go to conferences, I do that several times a year and meet \npeople there, this gives me an opportunity to meet people in these sectors\u201d \n(Consultant, Brussels).  \nOf course, membership of such associations is not open to everyone, \nbeing exclusive an even invite-based on occasions. Therefore, whilst the process \nof getting headhunted seems innocuous enough on the surface, for those with \nthe \u2018wrong\u2019 geography and outside of the \u2018club\u2019 world of headhunters \nopportunities for entering the networks that secure executive positions are \nlimited, something that can be detrimental for an individuals career success. \nIndeed, as one interviewee confirmed, \u201cAt the end of the day a headhunter is \nonly as good as their network, their personal relationship database\u2026The \nultimate headhunter is the person who doesn\u2019t have to do any cold calling\u201d \n(Consultant, London). Many fail to enter this network when they don\u2019t have the \nright geographical markers because, as one interviewee noted: \n\u201cin our case you only make it into the database if you are screened by us to \nsome extent\u2026or we know enough about you and we think it is worthwhile for you \nto be in our database\u201d (Consultant, London). \nMost interviewees suggested it wasn\u2019t worth putting individuals in the database if they \ndidn\u2019t fit, in part at least, the \u2018ideal\u2019 model outlined above. The geographical \nexclusiveness in elite labour markets that results from such a selective filtering \nprocedure in the headhunting process is also then further reinforced by the sourcing \nstrategies of consultants because of how ideal-type candidates often only \nrecommending people they know will fit the headhunters\u2019 model. All of this produces \nwhat might be called the \u2018new boys network\u2019 of executive search. Indeed, as one \n 26 \ninterviewee suggested, \u201cThe old boys network still remains [but] these techniques [of \nusing the database and sourcing] make it possible to cover your ass\u201d (Consultant, \nAmsterdam). Of course, we are not suggesting that every candidate will fit the \nheadhunters \u2018model\u2019 perfectly, or that those without the \u2018ideal\u2019 geographical markers \nwill never be headhunted. Rather it means that there is an elite and preferred stratum \nof candidates who dominate in elite labour markets at the expense of those not fitting \nthe model. Consequently, individuals with the right geographical biographies gain \npowerful, dominant positions in elite labour markets leaving those less-than ideal-type \ncandidates poorly placed to compete in what, according to the rhetoric, are open, \ntalent-defined and fluid elite labour markets in the contemporary knowledge economy.   \n \nConclusions \n In this paper we have sought to critically analyse many of the discourses that \nsurround the knowledge economy and ideals of elite labour mobility through an \nexamination of the role of executive search firms. In doing this we have made two main \narguments. First, we have shown how search firms have constructed themselves a \nposition of power in elite labour markets, in part by utilising many of the discourses \nassociated with the knowledge economy. Second, we have suggested that this \nprocess has resulted in the emergence of a new form of geographically-inscribed \nhierarchy and exclusiveness in elite labour markets, what we have termed the \u2018new \nboys network\u2019. This has implications for a number of existing debates.  \n Theoretically, our arguments develop existing discussions of networks and \norganisational geographies of power. The analysis of the way executive search firms \nhave used various discourses and technologies to construct their position of power in \nelite labour recruitment processes suggests much more emphasis should be placed on \nthe way organisations organise in order to manufacture such economically beneficial \n 27 \nsituations. Taking organizing to be a verb, we have shown the way search firms have \nstrategically enrolled existing cultural circuits of capitalism (Thrift 1997) and coupled \nthem to the technologies of firms as resources for developing relationships of power \nwith potential clients. This reveals the way that positions of power emerge as a result \nof the tactical, discourse fuelled behaviours of individuals within firms and that such \npositions are likely to be temporally fluid as the resources enrolled change in their \nvalue and usefulness. This mirrors Foucault\u2019s (1991) idea of governmentality but \napplies the concept in an organizational setting to understand the \u2018art of \ngovernmentality\u2019 and the resources associated with the construction of power relations.  \nIndeed, the governance role in elite labour recruitment networks afforded \nexecutive search firms mean that, as intermediaries acting as gatekeepers, individuals \nmust negotiate access to potential employers through headhunters. This means fitting \nthe candidate models constructed, models that empower individuals with certain types \nof geographical knowledge, experience and mobility. This benefits those with Anglo-\nAmerican origins and\/or experiences, disempowers those from outside of the capitalist \nhotspots of the contemporary economy and creates a geographical bent to elite labour \nmarkets. In effect executive search firms, through their governance actions, render \npowerful the resources of certain individuals and render less powerful the knowledge \nand experiences of others. This highlights to the importance of also recognising the \ngeographically imbued nature of power relations, with geographical histories \ndetermining the relative value of an individual\u2019s resources. Moreover it also suggests \nthat it is important to further tease apart both the way intentional strategies allow \nresources to be exploited for the creation of powerful relations, but also the way \nindividuals and groups can be unintentionally disempowered by the actions of others. \nWhilst power relations might not be a zero-sum game (Allen, 2003), it seems that the \nrelational nature of power constantly produces new geographical power geometries \n 28 \ndefining the influence of different groups. The losers, perhaps predictably, are those \noperating outside of hegemonic places and systems in the contemporary economy. \nThis challenges the idea of the knowledge economy being meritocratic and \nopen to all with talent.  \nOne significant caveat should, however, be added to this argument. As Allen \n(2003) points out, the development of power relations involves an agent manufacturing \na position of power through the deployment of resources but also the enrolment and \n\u2018acceptance\u2019 of this by other parties. In the case of the authority of executive search \nfirms the acceptance by clients of the belief that a candidate with a particular \ngeographical biography is likely to be the best person for an executive position has \nbeen somewhat taken for granted. We have not, then, explored the geographically \nvariegated ways that clients respond to the deployment of these resources by \nexecutive search firms. It would seem important to further examine the variations in \nacceptance, role and practice of search firms between markets. For example, it might \nbe expected that in the UK and USA client behaviours are very similar (as the Anglo-\nAmerican model in the varieties of capitalism literatures would suggest) whilst German \nmarkets and Japanese clients would be very different due to diverse labour institutions \n(Hall and Soskice, 2001). Space has prohibited a full analysis of this here. However, it \nwould seem a fruitful avenue for further investigation. Indeed, as we have shown, \ngeography seems to be an inherent part of the discourses and power relations \nassociated with the knowledge economy, something that generally deserves much \nmore attention from geographers.    \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n 29 \nThis paper is based on work completed as part of the ESRC project RES-000-22-1498 \n\u201cThe globalization of the executive search industry in Europe\u201d.     \n \n \n \n \n \n \nReferences \nAllen, J.
