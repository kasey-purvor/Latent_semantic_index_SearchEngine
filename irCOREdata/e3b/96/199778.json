Far from giving the coup de\ngrace to vestigial rights, enclosure destroyed a viable and effective agricultural system\nand proletarianized many commoners who had previously benefitted significantly. In the\nprocess the cooperative solidaristic village with negotiation and intercourse frequent\nacross class lines was destroyed forever. As in all great tragedies our hero is doomed\nfrom the outset. How could the commoners stand against a parliament of property\nowners and lawyers? The issue here is not the relative efficiency of competing systems\n(though perhaps Neeson should have reflected on this conventional presentation) but\nthe redistribution embedded in privatization. Tragically too, the burden of events\nweighed ominously even on the victors. The English proletariat emerged feeling tricked\nand cheated. Iron entered its soul to embitter class relations. Neeson's conclusion finds\nan echo in the historical construction of gender. Men and women, as well as men from\ndifferent backgrounds, interacted around the management of the commons. Enclosure\ncontributed to an emerging gulf between the sexes, to the increasing dependence and\nmarginalization of women. Here, as elsewhere, gender was made in the same bitter\ncrucible as class.\nJANE HUMPHRIES, Cambridge University\nPolitics and the People: A Study in English Political Culture, c. 1815-1867. By James\nVernon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993. Pp. xviii, 429.\nThe central question in this book is, as James Vernon freely admits, not an original\none: why is it important to study the politics of the disenfranchised in order to\nunderstand the evolution of the British political system during roughly the first three\nquarters of the nineteenth century. Vernon has written a so-called deconstructionist\nstudy that focuses on visual symbols, the oral tradition, and the popular printed media\nin five English parliamentary constituencies (Boston, Lewes, Oldham, South Devon,\nand Tower Hamlets). In so doing, he rejects (explicitly) the tradition of socialist\nhistorians (of whatever hue) who have portrayed a political system that increasingly\nfractured along class lines, and (implicitly because he never cites them) the new school\nof liberal political economists who identify themselves with rational-, social-, or\npublic-choice theories. Such an attempt is timely because both schools of thought are\npresently undergoing a quasi-identity crisis\u2014the demise of communism has left the class\nconflict interpretation of history out in the cold, and increasingly public-choice theorists\nare seeking to extend their economically determinist models to incorporate political\ninstitutions and ideologies.\nVernon's approach emphasizes the continuity of the British political system in which\nnew institutions such as political parties emerge slowly and do so at the local level only\nby accommodating themselves within traditional, and largely symbolic, forms of\norganization. Similarly, the traditions of popular participation in local politics through\nthe mass meeting and the practice of open voting were preserved well into the\nnineteenth century and became the vehicles through which a new system emerged that\nonly gradually \"privatized\" politics by taking it into the home, a process which\nculminated in the adoption of the secret ballot. Ultimately, however, the reliance on\ntradition and the process of politics is unsatisfying: people are radicals or conservatives\nsimply because they seem to have always been so. The argument largely ignores\neconomic change, despite the fact that at least one of the constituencies (Oldham), and\nmost probably a second (Tower Hamlets), owed their existence to industrialization.\nVernon does not for instance explain why Oldham's factory owning MPs found common\ncause with the disenfranchised.\nReviews of Books 173\nA second peg on which Vernon seeks to hang his argument is the position of women\nin local politics. Gender is perhaps a strange peg to choose, and Vernon is at times guilty\nof the very tokenism that he seeks to avoid by emphasizing the role of women. The\nproblem is that at the end of the day we can all agree on one thing, women played a very\nlittle part in political life throughout most of the nineteenth century.\nVernon's central argument, that there was a strong element of gradualness in the way\nin which foncepts such as political parties were grafted on to local political life, has\nmuch to recommend. Unfortunately, however, the book is a missed opportunity. At the\nmoment there appear to be two schools of writing on the emergence of the nineteenth-\ncentury British political system that are not talking to one another. On the one hand\nthere is the work of Patrick Joyce, Geoff Eley, and Vernon who have sought to redefine\nthe meaning of class and political culture within the tradition of discursive social history.\nOn the other hand there is the work of Gary Cox, John Phillips, and others whose\nmethodology speaks another language entirely. It would, for instance, be interesting to\nsee Vernon's assessment of Phillips and Wetherell's recent study of municipal politics\nin the borough of Shrewsbury, and vice versa. Unfortunately, under the current rules of\nengagement, neither side is inclined to take on the other.\nCHERYL SCHONHARDT-BAILEY, London School of Economics\nThe Rise of Popular Literacy in Victorian England: The Influence of Private Choice and\nPublic Policy. By David F. Mitch. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press,\n1992. Pp. xxiii, 340. $34.95.\nAfter stagnating at around 50 percent from 1750 to 1833, the literacy rate among\nEngland's young adults rose to 95 percent by 1900. Was this a response to the pull of\nworking-class demand or to the push of an elite that required, subsidized, and supplied\npublic schooling? David Mitch's impressive book pursues this question with patient\nconsistency and delivers balanced conclusions. Along the way, Mitch surveys several\nsubliteratures in the history of how and why literacy rose and offers cautious judgments\non the importance of several influences conjectured by earlier writers.\nPart 1 concerns the ways in which private demand for schooling became increasingly\nwidespread among the working classes. Chapter 2, on the benefits of literacy in the\nworkplace, goes straight to the commonly presumed link between occupational change\nand the spread of literacy. A careful reckoning finds that changes in the occupations of\nyoung adults raised their own literacy only 7-10 percent, out of the total rise of about 45\npercent between 1841 and 1891 (or between 1840 and 1900). This excludes any feedback\nof each generation's literacy on the literacy of their children, an effect that is treated\nlater in the book. Chapter 3, on literacy as an equipment for living, ranges broadly\nacross the themes of social history, especially the interaction between working-class\nliteracy and the rise of a cheap popular press. The account here is full of nuance, without\nfeaturing any particular conclusion. Chapter 4 rounds out the private-demand side with\na careful weighing of five possible effects of \"family\" on children's ability to read and\nwrite: the effects of fathers' occupations on the literacy of brides and bridegrooms, the\nparental-income elasticity of school enrollments and literacy, the interactions between\nfertility decline and families' demand for education, the impact of mortality decline on\neducational investments in each child, and the effect of their parents' literacy on the\nliteracy of adults. Of these, only the last is assigned a major causal role. It, plus the\nexpansion of the supply of cheap newspapers, is credited with raising literacy by 0-15\npercent.\nThe three chapters on the rise of public schooling and its link to literacy are a balanced\nand informative synthesis of Parliamentary evidence and scholarly publications. Mitch's\naccounting acknowledges the achievements of both the private fee-paid instruction that\n"}
