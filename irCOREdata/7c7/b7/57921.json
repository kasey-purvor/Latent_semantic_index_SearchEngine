Introduction\nAtmospheric storm tracks occur at midlatitudes, pre-\ndominantly over the western part of ocean basins, as re-\nvealed in enhanced synoptic-scale bandpass-filtered vari-\nance (Fig. 1a), and are linked to the strong westerly jets in\nthe troposphere and stratosphere (Blackmon et al. 1977;\nHoskins and Valdes 1990; Chang et al. 2002). The storm\ntracks are associated with the life cycle of synoptic-scale\neddies, which amplify as they pass along the storm track\nand eventually decay downstream (Hoskins et al. 1983;\nHoskins and Hodges 2002, 2005). There is an ongoing\ndebate as to how storm tracks are controlled, particularly\nin terms of how their structure deviates from zonal\nsymmetry and how they vary along track.\nA mechanism is needed to maintain storm tracks\nbecause synoptic-scale eddies locally reduce the baro-\nclinicity from which they draw their energy. Hoskins\nand Valdes (1990) proposed that storm tracks are main-\ntained by surface heating from the ocean through the\nheat supplied by warm western boundary currents. In\ncontrast, orography is widely viewed as controlling the\nstationary planetary wave pattern (Nigam et al. 1988;\nSeager et al. 2002), which provides a waveguide for storm-\ntrack eddies (Chang et al. 2002). In addition, Seager\nCorresponding author address: Dr. Chris Wilson, Proudman\nOceanographic Laboratory, 6 Brownlow Street, Liverpool, L3 5DA,\nUnited Kingdom.\nE-mail: cwi@pol.ac.uk\n1 JULY 2009 W I L SON ET AL . 3689\nDOI: 10.1175\/2009JCLI2651.1\n! 2009 American Meteorological Society\net al. (2002) argue that ocean heat transport only plays a\nminor role in controlling the midlatitude air tempera-\nture contrast across theNorthAtlantic. Partly reconciling\nthese views, Held et al. (2002) argue that both surface\nheating and orography are important in determining the\nstationary wave pattern and, by implication, the storm\ntracks. The intrinsic connection between stationary\nplanetary jets and storm tracks is also, possibly, linked\nto nonlocal forcing and organization of eddy mixing,\nsuch as has been invoked to explain zonal jets on gas\ngiants, such as Jupiter and Saturn, where eddy mixing is\ninhibited through the formation of a \u2018\u2018potential vorticity\nstaircase\u2019\u2019 (Baldwin et al. 2007).\nIn this study, the roles of ocean dynamics, orography,\nand their possible interaction are explored in terms of\ntheir effect on storm tracks in the Northern Hemisphere\nwinter, as well as their modification of the surface ther-\nmodynamics. Four experiments are performed with a\ncoupled atmosphere\u2013ocean general circulation model\nwith intermediate complexity; the experiments either\nswitch orographic forcing on or off, by having orography\nor flat continents of 1-m height, and either switch ocean\ndynamics on or off, by having a fully dynamic ocean or a\nslab ocean consisting of a 30-m-thick mixed layer. The\nmodel experiments are described in section 2. The sep-\narate mechanisms forcing the storm tracks and modi-\nfying the surface thermodynamics are diagnosed from the\ndifferences between the model experiments in section 3,\nand the implications are discussed in section 4.\n2. Coupled climate model experiments\na. Description of numerical model and four\nclimate experiments\nThe Fast Ocean Rapid Troposphere Experiment\n(FORTE) coupled climate model consists of a 15-sigma-\nlevel, T42 horizontal resolution spectral atmosphere\n(Forster et al. 2000), coupled to a 15-level Cartesian\ncoordinate, 28 horizontal resolution ocean (Webb 1996),\nwith a simple thermodynamic sea ice model and ocean\neddy parameterization scheme (see the appendix; see\nalso Sinha and Smith 2002; Smith 2004; Blaker et al.\n2006). The model has a stable climate and does not need\nflux adjustment. The storm tracks are reasonably well\nresolved and the ocean resolution is sufficient to include\ngyre circulations with western boundary currents (al-\nthough it is insufficient to resolve their extension into\nthe gyre interior).\nb. Model verification\nAs should be expected from an intermediate-complexity\ncoupled model, model biases are present (Fig. 1). Storm-\ntrack eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is slightly too strong in\nthe core; the track is too broad in the north and extends\ntoo far into Europe (Figs. 1a,b). This bias is present in\nmany other models (Black and Dole 2000) and may be\nrelated to deficiencies in the planetary mean flow. In our\ncase, we believe it is related to a bias toward too-weak\nzonal stretching deformation in the Atlantic jet exit.\nThe 756-mb high-pass northward eddy temperature flux\nis also too intense in the model (Figs. 1c,d) and extends\ntoo far north and into Europe. The intensification of the\nstorm track is probably related to midlatitude SST bias\nFIG. 1. ERA-40 and FORTEmodel climatologies and biases for\na 10-yr winter mean (1992\u20132002 for ERA-40).

While the broad pattern of SST is similar\nto the climatology (Fig. 1e), the SST bias (Fig. 1f) sug-\ngests an intensification of the meridional SST gradient\naround 508N, which is consistent with a strengthening in\nlower-level baroclinicity at the Pacific andAtlantic storm-\ntrack entrances. There is also an overly intense equa-\ntorial Pacific cold tongue (Fig. 1f), which is a common\nproblem in climate models with a coarse-resolution\nocean component.\nDespite these caveats, it is a testament to the core\nphysics of the FORTE model that it produces such a\nstable and reasonable climate, despite being less com-\nplex than the current state-of-the-art coupled climate\nmodels. For example, Winton (2003) finds that a similar\nslab ocean model freezes over into a snowball Earth\nstate. The main difference is that our model uses a\nsimple thermodynamic sea ice parameterization scheme,\nrather than a dynamic scheme. Winton (2003) also\ndemonstrates that the same model has a stable climate\nwhen a simple thermodynamic sea ice parameterization\nscheme is used. Both Winton (2003) and Medeiros et al.\n(2008) additionally discuss the sensitivity of climate\nmodels to cloud parameterization schemes. These are\ntwo areas of uncertainty that may indeed have general\nimplications for the robustness of climate model results.\nAlthough the FORTE model biases are, in certain re-\ngions, larger than the forcing response, the general\nstructure of the large-scale fields and storm tracks are\nsatisfactory, because we are concerned mostly with\nthe first-order structural changes and responses in our\nidealized experiments. For such experiments a full-\ncomplexity coupled climate model (which also contains\nbiases) is unsuitable because of the computational ex-\npense, and the FORTEmodel provides a useful efficient\ncompromise.\nc. Idealized model experiments\nThe aim of these experiments is to determine the\nlinear and nonlinear effects of forcing from ocean dy-\nnamics and orography on the storm track. The four\nexperiments are as follows:\n1) a run without mountains and with a 30-m-deep, static\nmixed layer (slab) ocean referred to as the \u2018\u2018ground\nstate\u2019\u2019 (RUN2OC2M);\n2) a run without mountains and with a fully dynamic\nocean (RUN1OC2M);\n3) a run with mountains and with a 30-m-deep, static\nmixed layer ocean (RUN2OC1M); and\n4) a run with mountains and a dynamic ocean referred\nto as the control state, which is viewed as the most\nrealistic case (RUN1OC1M)\nThe focus of the experiments is to understand the\nbackground quasi\u2013steady state, rather than the inter-\nannual or decadal variability. Hence, the runs with\nocean dynamics are spun up for 90 yr and the slab ocean\nruns are spun up for 10 yr, with a subsequent 10 yr of\neach being diagnosed. The slab ocean also has 28 hori-\nzontal resolution, and it is similar in many respects to\nthe 50-m-deep slab version of the Hadley Centre Slab\nModel, version 3 (HadSM3), which is used in the Climate\nPrediction.net (online at http:\/\/www.climateprediction.\nnet\/) experiments (e.g., Stainforth et al. 2005). The\nequilibration of the four runs is shown by time series of\nglobal-mean sea surface temperature (Fig. 4, bottom).\nThis illustrates that neither the atmosphere nor the\nocean are drifting, and that the slab ocean is able to\nstore sufficient heat. It is a testament to the model core\nphysics and parameterization schemes that the climate\ndoes not drift even though there is no flux correction.\nBecause we are most concerned with the storm-track\nresponse on short time scales, our intention is to spin\nup the upper ocean, rather than the deep meridional\noverturning circulation. The latter would take several\nmillennia to equilibrate and is therefore prohibitively\nexpensive for this study, as is the case for the majority of\nOGCM studies.\nAs a starting point, consider proxies used to identify\nstorm tracks, high-pass-filtered EKE at 250 mb and the\nEady growth rate at 756 mb, measuring the baroclinicity\nof the lower atmosphere (Hoskins and Valdes 1990). In\nthe winter mean [December\u2013February (DJF)] of the\nground-state experiment with no mountains or ocean\ndynamics, there is enhanced atmospheric variability over\na midlatitude band and with local maxima in baro-\nclinicity over the oceans (RUN2OC2M); see Figs. 2b, 3b.\nHence, there is a midlatitude storm track with atmo-\nspheric eddies growing through baroclinic instability\nover the North Pacific, crossing North America with-\nout significant decay, but weakening as they cross the\nwider combined landmasses of Europe and Asia (Figs.\n2b, 3b).\nGiven that there are no mountains or ocean dynamics\nin this integration, the enhanced eddy variability in the\nmidlatitudes probably reflects how upper-air moving\npoleward in the Hadley cell is deflected into fast-moving\nzonal jets (through angular momentum conservation).\nThe baroclinicity in these jets is then enhanced over the\nwarm, moist oceans and weakened over the land.\nThe storm track becomes more realistic as both ocean\ndynamics and orography are included, becoming sharper,\nless zonal, and acquiring more along-track variability:\nthe storm tracks in the control run (RUN1OC1M,\nFig. 2a) are the closest to the observational diagnostics\n(Fig. 1a).\n1 JULY 2009 W I L SON ET AL . 3691\nd. Calculation of the forcing components\nand interaction\nThe separate effects of ocean dynamics, orography,\nand their interaction on the storm track are now diag-\nnosed from the differences within the set of model ex-\nperiments. Consider a general diagnostic variable X,\nsuch as eddy kinetic energy, for each of the four ex-\nperiments (Fig. 4, top): X in the ground state run\nwithout mountains or ocean dynamics is denoted by\nX2OC2M and X in the control run by X1OC1M, with\nsimilar notation for the other runs. The net effect of\nforcing by mountains and ocean dynamics on X is given\nbyN5X1OC1M2X2OC2M5M1O1 I, whereM,O,\nand I represent the individual forcing from mountains,\nocean dynamics, and the interaction between these two,\nand are diagnosed from the differences in the four ex-\nperiments (Fig. 4, top). The transition from the ground\nstate, whose only source of zonal asymmetry is the\ndistribution of the continents, to the control state, which\nhas much more asymmetry, is given by the net forcing\nN 5 M 1 O 1 I. Each term in this sum is formed from\na difference, which may or may not be significantly dif-\nferent to zero, with respect to the 10 yr of natural var-\niability in each of the experiments. To avoid misleading\ninterpretations, the relative importance of M, O, and I\nare only displayed in the plots when the signal is 95%\nsignificantly different from zero.\nFIG. 2. The Northern Hemisphere winter-mean tracks [square\ntoot of 250-mb high-pass EKE (m s21), shaded] and mean flow\n(250-mb streamfunction, contour interval of 1.5 3 107 m2 s21)\nfor the last 10 winters of each of the four model integrations.\n(a) RUN1OC1M, the control run, has broadly similar storm\ntracks to ERA-40, as shown in Fig. 1a. (b) By removing both ocean\nadvection and orography, as shown in RUN2OC2M, the mean\nflow is almost zonal and the storm track is much stronger that\nthe control. The only source of the sizeable zonal asymmetry is\nthe distribution of the (flat) continents. (c) By removing ocean\nadvection and retaining orography, as shown in RUN2OC1M,\nwhich has a slab ocean, the mean flow is almost unaltered from the\ncontrol, but the storm track becomes stronger. (d) By removing\norography and retaining ocean dynamics, as shown in RUN1\nOC2M, the mean flow becomes much more zonal, as does the\nstorm track. The storm track is also slightly stronger than the\ncontrol.\nFIG. 3. The baroclinicity of he Northern Hemisphere winter-\nmean storm tracks as revealed by the Eady growth rate\n0.31( f \/N)(\u203aU\/\u203az) (day21) at 756 mB for the four experiments\nwith streamfunction overlaid (contour interval of 5 3 106 m2 s21)\nand masking within 1 km of orography: (a) the control simula-\ntion, RUN1OC1M, with orography and a dynamic ocean;\n(b) RUN2OC2M, the ground state with a slab ocean and no\norography; (c) RUN2OC1M, with orography and a slab ocean;\nand (d) RUN1OC2M, with a dynamic ocean and no orography.\n3692 JOURNAL OF CL IMATE VOLUME 22\nWhile the separate forcings from orography and ocean\ndynamics are easy to understand, the nonlinear interaction\nis best understood as involving either (i) changes to\nocean flow resulting from orography, such as stationary\nplanetary waves forced by orography altering the un-\nderlying ocean, or (ii) changes to orographic processes\nresulting from ocean flow, such as the presence of ocean\ngyres affecting evaporation and subsequent relief rainfall.\n3. How is the storm-track pattern affected by\norography and ocean dynamics?\nThe effects of orography, ocean dynamics, and their\ninteraction in the model experiments are now discussed\nin terms of diagnostic measures of the storm track,\nchanges in the thermodynamic forcing by the ocean, and\nvariations in the meridional heat transport.\na. Diagnostics for the eddy variability in the\nstorm tracks\nStorm-track signals of EKE and eddy temperature\nflux, as well as the mean flow pattern, are now consid-\nered in more detail.\n1) EDDY KINETIC ENERGY\nAs discussed previously, the EKE in the control run\nis similar in form and magnitude to that diagnosed from\n40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather\nForecasts (ECMWF)Re-Analysis (ERA-40; Figs. 5a, 1a),\nwhile the EKE in the ground state is more zonally uni-\nform and slightly stronger (RUN2OC2M, Fig. 5b).\nThe net forcing, to produce the control state from the\nground state, consists of a damping of slightly greater\nthan 3 m s21 over the midlatitudes between 208 and\n608N, excluding the central North Pacific, together with\nan intensification of up to 2 m s21 near Iceland and\nnorth of Kazakhstan (N, Fig. 5c). By preferentially\ndamping the equatorward side of the storm track and\nintensifying the poleward side, this forcing shifts the\nstorm track poleward, but not in a zonally uniform\nmanner, and introduces along-track variability. There is\nalso a net intensification of EKE in the tropics, but this\ndoes little to alter the large-scale storm-track pattern,\nwhich is strongest at the midlatitudes.\nOrographic forcing acts mainly to damp storm-track\nEKE by up to 20% over land, downstream of oro-\ngraphic features such as the Tibetan Plateau, Rockies,\nand Alps (M, Fig. 5d). Some of this damping extends\ninto ocean regions between 108 and 408N, while at the\nsame time orographic forcing leads to an intensification\nof the storm track north of Kazakhstan. The strong\norographic damping surrounding the Tibetan Plateau\nprevents the storm track from extending zonally across\nEurasia, causing it to instead begin in the western Pacific\nand end upstream of Tibet. The orographic damping\nover North America can be considered to separate the\nsingle storm track into two Pacific and Atlantic parts.\nOcean forcing acts to damp the southern flank of the\nstorm track in the ground state and intensify its northern\nflank, typically by up to 20%, thus shifting the storm\ntrack poleward (O, Fig. 5e). Some along-track varia-\nbility in the ocean forcing and cancellation with moun-\ntain forcing gives the storm track its poleward tilt in the\nAtlantic. Ocean forcing is responsible for the net in-\ntensification of the EKE in the tropics.\nThe interaction term between orography and ocean\nforcing is limited to only localized regions of signifi-\ncance, intensifying the storm track over the Tibetan\nPlateau and in the eastern Pacific, and damping in the\neastern Atlantic and at high latitudes (I, Fig. 5f).\nFIG. 4. (top) A schematic showing the differencing required to\nobtain the components of forcing from mountains (M), ocean\ndynamics (O), and the interaction between mountains and ocean\ndynamics (I). For a chosen diagnostic, such as EKE, one obtains\nthe forcing components through such differencing of that diag-\nnostic in the relevant model runs. For example, to obtain the in-\nfluence of mountains on EKE (M), one subtracts the EKE in the\nground state (RUN2OC2M) from the EKE in RUN2OC1M.\nNote that, due to the interaction (which may involve both lin-\near and nonlinear processes) between mountains and ocean dy-\nnamics, the net forcing (N) required to reach the control state\n(RUN1OC1M) from the ground state (RUN2OC2M) is not\nsimply the sum M 1 O, but involves an extra contribution (I).\nAn example of such an interaction is the effect of mountains\nchanging the pattern of ocean advection.

The slab\nocean runs equilibrate the fastest. In each case, the last 10 yr of\nsimulation are analyzed for this study.\n1 JULY 2009 W I L SON ET AL . 3693\n2) EDDY TEMPERATURE FLUX\nThe northward eddy temperature flux is a marker of\nbaroclinic instability, because baroclinic instability is\nthe main mechanism for atmospheric poleward heat\ntransfer at mid- to high latitudes. In the ground state,\nthere is only one EKE maximum (Fig. 5b), but two y9T9\nmaxima at 756 mb (Fig. 6b), as in the Eady growth rate\n(Fig. 3b). This more complicated pattern reflects the\nway in which baroclinic instability effectively switches off\nover continents and switches on again as ocean is en-\ncountered. The maximum in y9T9 in the Pacific is up-\nstream of the maximum in EKE, reflecting how eddies\nprovide a poleward heat flux within the storm-track en-\ntrance and subsequently amplify downstream.\nThe net forcing (N, Fig. 6c) acts largely to damp y9T9\nover land and to damp the southern flank of the storm\ntrack over the ocean sectors, weakening the eddy tem-\nperature flux overall and shifting it poleward. There is\nminor intensification at high northern latitudes. Orog-\nraphy again tends to damp y9T9 over land by up to 50%,\nbut with some intensification over northern Eurasia and\nin local regions downstream of the Tibetan Plateau and\nthe Rockies (M, Fig. 6d). Ocean forcing leads to a\npoleward shift of the poleward eddy temperature flux,\ndamping by 50% on the equatorward side of the storm\ntrack, with some local intensification over Labrador (O,\nFig. 6e). The interaction intensifies the poleward tem-\nperature flux over Tibet, but not strongly enough to\ncounteract the opposing damping over land from M\nand O (I, Fig. 6f), which causes along-track variability.\nFIG. 5.

In this way, the\neddies and the mean flow are intrinsically linked, and\nthus must be considered together to understand either\npart. The mean flow pattern at 250 mb in the ground\nstate is generally zonally symmetric, with along-track\nvariability resulting from the continental distribution,\nwith weaker flow as the jet diverges slightly over Europe\n(RUN2OC2M, Fig. 7b). In comparison, the midlati-\ntude jet structure in the control state has a more realistic\nnortheastward tilt over the oceans and a marked along-\ntrack variability in intensity (RUN1OC1M, Fig. 7a).\nThe net changes necessary for going from the ground\nstate to the control are diagnosed using a vector sum-\nmation for the flow prior to displaying the separate\ncontributions in terms of speed and streamfunction pat-\ntern. The net forcing (N) damps the eastward flow over\nmidlatitudes from the central Pacific to western Europe,\nand also consists of a superposition of large-scale re-\ncirculations that represent stronger stationary waves (N,\nFig. 7c). This pattern of the stationary waves compares\nreasonably well to that from National Centers for Envi-\nronmental Prediction\u2013National Center for Atmospheric\nResearch (NCEP\u2013NCAR), as shown in Held et al.\n(2002).\nOrographic forcing causes a northeastward tilt of the\njet over the Pacific and Atlantic through its strong me-\nridional components and strong northeastward forcing\nnear Japan and the Gulf of Mexico, associated with\nstationary waves from the Tibetan Plateau and the\nRockies (M, Fig. 7d). This wave train extends equator-\nward from Tibet.\nOcean dynamics acts mainly to damp the southern\nflank of the westerly jet in the ground state (O, Fig. 7b)\nin a zonal manner from 1408E to 08 and to damp the\nnorthern flank over Eurasia. Ocean forcing causes the jet\nto shift poleward across a band extending from the west-\nern Pacific right across to the eastern Atlantic (1408E\u201308),\nwith accompanying northeastward tilt over Japan and a\nsoutheastward tilt over Europe. There is also a slight\nequatorward shift of the jet over Eurasia.\nThe forcing from the interaction between ocean dy-\nnamics andorographic forcinghas a significantmeridional\ncomponent (I, Fig. 7f), which causes a slight southeast-\nward tilt over the central Pacific and makes a contribu-\ntion to the northeastward tilt over the North Atlantic.\n4) E-VECTORS AND THE EDDY-MEDIATED\nRESPONSE\nTransient eddies within the storm track can interact\nwith and affect the large-scale mean flow pattern and\nstability. Eddies transport momentum from source to\nsink, and E-vectors (Hoskins et al. 1983) provide more\ninformation about typical eddy life cycles and reveal\nthe eddy-mediated response to anomalous forcing. The\ncontrol state (RUN1OC1M, Fig. 8a) has eastward\n250-mb high-pass E-vectors in the storm track, which\ndiverge over the entrances of the Pacific and Atlantic\nstorm track and converge over the exits and southern\nflank. The E-vector E 5 (y92 ! u92,! u9y9) describes\nchanges to eddy isotropy. For example, in the extra-\ntropics transient eddies tend to be meridionally elon-\ngated, hence the tendency for an eastward E-vector and\ngroup propagation relative to the mean flow. Strictly,\nFIG. 7. As in Figs. 5a\u2013f, but for the 250-mbmean velocity (vectors),\nstreamfunction (dashed), and speed (shaded, m s21).\n1 JULY 2009 W I L SON ET AL . 3695\nthe E-vector is equivalent to a flux of westward mo-\nmentum, and regions of divergence are associated with\nan eastward acceleration of the mean flow by the eddies.\nTherefore, in both the control state (RUN1OC1M,\nFig. 8a) and the ground state (RUN2OC2M, Fig. 8b),\ntransient eddies generally accelerate the mean flow\neastward within the storm track. In the ground state,\nthere is more zonal symmetry than in the control, with\neddy-mean interaction being strongest over the ocean in\nthe latter. In both the control and ground state, eddies\nprovide a weak westward acceleration to the mean flow\nat around 208N and a weak eastward acceleration near\nthe equator. The net forcing (Fig. 8c) acts to provide a\ngenerally westward E-vector over eastern Eurasia and\nthe western Pacific and over the southern flank of the\nmidlatitude storm track at 408N from the eastern Pacific\nextending eastward across the Atlantic and Eurasia.\nThis net forcing is accompanied by an anomalous con-\nvergence of the E-vector field, reducing the overall\neastward acceleration provided by the eddies on the\nmean flow, and thus weakening the midlatitude jet over\neastern Eurasia and from the eastern Pacific eastward\nacross the Atlantic and Eurasia.\nIn the tropical Pacific, the net forcing shows a weak\nE-vector divergence, equivalent to a weak eastward accel-\neration of the mean flow by the eddies. Examination\nof the forcing components (Figs. 8d\u2013f) shows that this\ntropical source of eddy forcing (and eddy-mean forcing) is\ndue to ocean dynamics. Ocean dynamics also account for\nmuch of the net deceleration of the midlatitude jet and\nstrengthening of the planetary stationary wave pattern\nover the Atlantic through tilt to the mean flow. Oro-\ngraphic forcing predominantly affects the E-vector field\nover and downstream of the Tibetan Plateau, reinforcing\nthe effect of ocean dynamics and providing a damping of\nthe eastward jet there. For example, one can see that the\nanomalous E-vectors are oriented northwestward over\nthe western Pacific (Fig. 8d). Because 2E represents a\nflux of eastward momentum and the divergence of an\neastward accelerationE, the effect of the Tibetan Plateau\nis to force the almost zonal ground-state mean flow\n(Fig. 7b) and eddies (Fig. 8b) to alter their individual\nmomentum by, respectively, tilting northeastward and\nfluxing eastward momentum southeastward. This is ach-\nieved by the eddy deceleration of the northern flank of\nthe ground-state jet over eastern Eurasia. The associated\nchanges in eddy isotropy lead to the altered eddy east-\nward momentum flux, and ignoring dissipative forcing,\nact to balance the overall eastward momentum budget. In\nthis way, the generation and propagation of transient\neddies provides a mechanism for communicating the\nforcing from orography, seen as a planetary wave train.\nThe interaction between ocean dynamics and orography,\nhowever, has little effect on E-vectors (Fig. 8f).\nAlthough we can now state that ocean dynamics de-\ncelerate the midlatitude eastward jet and increase its tilt\nthrough an eddy-mediated process, we must now con-\nsider surface boundary forcing for the likely source of\nthese changes. It is here that ocean dynamics are able to\nbegin to alter the transient eddy field and therefore\neventually the large-scale mean flow.\nb. Thermodynamic forcing from the ocean\nThe land\u2013sea contrasts and ocean transport of heat\nare clearly playing a role in affecting the atmospheric\nstructure. Now examine how the sea surface tempera-\nture and surface heat flux is altered within the model\nexperiments, because the shear flow stability of the at-\nmosphere is strongly dependent on the surface tem-\nperature distribution (Hoskins et al. 1985).\nFIG. 8. As in Figs. 5a\u2013f, but for the 250-mb E-vector (vectors,\nm2 s22) and its isobaric divergence (shaded, 1025 m s22). The E-\nvectors are analogous to a flux of westward momentum, and their\ndivergence is equivalent (to within a gauge) to an eastward ac-\nceleration of the mean flow by the eddies. See the text for more\ndetails.\n3696 JOURNAL OF CL IMATE VOLUME 22\n1) SST\nThe coupled model integrations for the control are for\n100 yr with the ocean initialized from theWorld Ocean\nAtlas (WOA) climatology (Levitus et al. 1998), and\nintegrations for the ground state are for 20 yr with the\nslab ocean being initialized from zonal mean of the\nclimatology. In the ground state, the SST pattern re-\nmains nearly zonal with SST gradients being slightly\nweaker on the eastern side of each basin (RUN-\n2OC2M, Fig. 9b). In the control, the winter-mean SST\npattern is more realistic, with a stronger tilt of the iso-\ntherms in the Atlantic (RUN1OC1M, Fig. 9a). The\nSST in the control is much warmer than in the ground\nstate at midlatitudes, by 38\u201368C in the Pacific and by 68C\nin the Atlantic (N, Fig. 9c). The control is up to 68C\ncooler than the ground state in the equatorial Pacific,\nand slightly less so in the equatorial Atlantic (N, Fig.\n9c).\nOcean dynamics, not surprisingly, is the most impor-\ntant process leading to the midlatitude warming, which\nis most enhanced on the western side of the basin (O,\nFig. 9e). Ocean forcing is also responsible for equatorial\ncooling, through upwelling of cold water and horizontal\nadvection of warmwater poleward. This equatorial cooling\nis seen in the model SST bias (Fig. 1e), but is common in\ncoarse-resolution OGCMs.\nIn contrast, orographic forcing provides a slight warm-\ning of 18\u201338C over the central Atlantic and forces an\nSST dipole of 68C amplitude in the western Pacific (M,\nFig. 9d). The interaction term partly opposes this oro-\ngraphic forcing (I, Fig. 9f) and reduces SST over the\nPacific and intensifies SST over the northern Atlantic,\nnear Iceland, by over 68C. This nonlinear interaction is\nof a similar magnitude to that of O and M, thus illus-\ntrating the complicated interplay of forcing from orog-\nraphy and ocean dynamics.\n2) SST GRADIENT\nTo illustrate these changes in SST more clearly, now\nconsider the meridional gradient in SST. In the ground\nstate, the SST gradient is strongest and most negative\nacross both basins at around 408N (Fig. 10b), coinci-\ndent with the latitude of the storm track. In the control,\nthe SST gradient becomes most negative over the\nwestern side of each basin and in the northern North\nAtlantic (Fig. 10a). Again, this change in SST gradient\nreflects changes in the overlying storm track. The over-\nall change in SST gradient between the ground state\nand the control primarily involves a poleward shift in\nthe SST gradient, which is weakened in magnitude be-\ntween 208 and 408N and strengthened north of 508N\n(N, Fig. 10c).\nThis shift in SST gradient is primarily due to ocean\ndynamicswhere thewind-driven gyre circulation leads to\na tightening of SST gradients at the intergyre boundaries\nand a general warming of the midlatitudes (O, Fig. 10e).\nHowever, the action of orography and nonlinear inter-\naction complicate this response, with the nonlinear in-\nteraction further enhancing the SST gradient in the\nnorthern North Atlantic, while there is a complicated\npartial cancellation of the effects fromM,O, and I in the\nmidlatitude North Pacific (Figs. 10c\u2013f).\nIn the tropical Pacific, ocean dynamics leads to weak-\nening of the background meridional SST gradient. This\nreflects the extensive cold tongue and in a sense would\nimply a weakening of the overlying baroclinicity (N, Fig.\n10c). However, we do not see strong evidence of this\nsignal in the local 756-mb Eady growth rate (Fig. 3).\nIn terms of the effect of the midlatitude SST gradi-\nent on the overlying atmosphere, heuristically, a sharper\nFIG. 9. As in Figs. 5a\u2013f, but for the sea surface temperature\n(shaded, 8C).\n1 JULY 2009 W I L SON ET AL . 3697\nmeridional gradient of potential temperature over the\nRossby deformation length scale is expected to lead to\nincreased available potential energy for baroclinic in-\nstability and, thus, stronger storm tracks. Indeed, ocean\ndynamics lead to a poleward shift in SST gradient, which\nis associated with a poleward shift in the baroclinicity\nof the lower atmosphere as measured by the Eady\ngrowth rate.\n3) SURFACE HEAT FLUX\nGiven the subtle connection between SST and the\noverlying baroclinicity, consider how the surface heat\nflux between the atmosphere and ocean is modified.\nIn the ground state, the pattern of net surface heat\nloss (lost from the ocean to the atmosphere) is broadly\nzonal with a maximum loss between 408 and 508N across\nboth basins (RUN2OC2M, Fig. 10b). In contrast, in\nthe control state, the maximum surface heat loss\nreaching 300 W m22 shifts toward the western side of\nthe Pacific basin and northward toward the northern\nNorth Atlantic (RUN1OC1M, Fig. 10a). While the\nheat loss of the control is more plausible than in the\nground state, the surface heat loss does not capture the\nlocalized maxima over the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio\nExtension, since the ocean resolution is too coarse; see\nclimatologies such as that of Grist and Josey (2003). The\nnet forcing between these two states includes an in-\ncreased surface heat loss of between 60 and 180 W m22\nover the Kuroshio andGulf Stream, north of 558N in the\nPacific and more than 180 W m22 in the northern At-\nlantic (N, Fig. 11c). Conversely, there is an increase in\nthe heat flux into the ocean, in the tropical Pacific, and\nin the eastern side of the subtropical Atlantic. There is\nan ocean uptake of 60 W m22 in the tropical Pacific\nresulting from the net forcing related to the extended\nSST cold tongue (N, Fig. 11c).\nThis increase in surface heat loss is again primarily\ncontrolled by the inclusion of ocean dynamics where the\ngyre circulation leading to the surface heat loss over the\nboundary currents and the overturning circulation\nleading to the loss over the northernAtlantic (O, Fig. 11e).\nConversely, the ocean dynamics leads to a surface heat\nflux gain in the equatorial Pacific, with this being con-\nnected to the advective setup of the Pacific cold tongue.\nIn comparison, orography and the interaction increase\nthe surface heat loss near Iceland (M and I, Figs. 11d,f),\nwhile orography leads to a quadrupole pattern over the\nwestern Pacific, associated with stationary waves gen-\nerated from Tibet (Fig. 7d).\n4) RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE TROPICS\nThe changes to the surface boundary conditions in the\ntropics are mainly due to the effect of ocean dynamics\n(Figs. 9e, 10e, and 11e), which reduces SST, reverses the\nbackground meridional SST gradient, and increases net\nsurface ocean heat uptake near the equator. Given this\nforcing by the ocean, there can be both local (tropical)\nand nonlocal (extratropical) responses to these changes.\nLocally, the ocean forcing leads to the tropical\nPacific developing a weak mean flow recirculation,\nenhancement of the moisture content (not shown) and\nthe local EKE (Fig. 5e), and a weak eastward acceler-\nation of the mean flow implied by E-vector divergence\n(Fig. 8e). Therefore, we assume that these changes to\nEKE are probably related to the effect of moist con-\nvective processes or advection from the extratropics\n(e.g., Emanuel 1989), rather than to local baroclinic\ninstability.\nWhether the tropical changes are leading to an\nextratropical response, such as the weakening in east-\nward acceleration at midlatitudes (Fig. 8e), is more\nFIG. 10. Same as in Figs. 5a\u2013f, but for the meridional gradient of\nsea surface temperature (1026 K m21).\n3698 JOURNAL OF CL IMATE VOLUME 22\ndifficult to discern, particularly as there is forcing from a\ncombination of ocean dynamics (O), orographic forcing\n(M), and the nonlinear interaction (I). These are among\nthe concerns discussed in Held et al. (2002). While clear\nconnections are difficult to identify, there are plausible\nmechanisms for an extratropical response to changes in\nthe tropics. For example, Held et al. (1989) consider the\nextratropical response to El Nin\u02dco\/La Nin\u02dca conditions\nand the creation of the Pacific\u2013North American (PNA)\npattern. They find that anomalous tropical heating has\nlittle extratropical influence on its own, and that tran-\nsient eddies are needed for the teleconnection to mid-\nlatitudes. One may consider the role of ocean dynamics\nin our study as being analogous to the forcing provided\nby La Nin\u02dca in Held et al. (1989), since both produce\nanomalous cooling in the equatorial Pacific. Held et al.\n(1989) also use E-vectors to examine the teleconnection\nbetween tropics and extratropics (their Fig. 10), and\nthey find that during La Nin\u02dca conditions, eddies pene-\ntrate deeper into the tropics than in El Nin\u02dco conditions,\nand that they also force the jet poleward and cause\nblocking in the central Pacific, therefore weakening the\nstorm-track activity. This eddy-mediated teleconnection\nis crucial for the production of the PNA pattern in the\nstationary mean flow. In our study we see that ocean\ndynamics also allow eddy activity to penetrate deeper\ninto the tropics (Fig. 8e), but their role in extratropi-\ncal teleconnections is unclear in our study. In addition,\nOrlanski (2005) considers the response to anomalies in\nmid-Pacific baroclinicity and finds that a warming in the\ntropical Pacific is associated with an equatorward shift\nof the storm track (opposite for La Nin\u02dca), which is\nlinked to tropical baroclinicity changes, as well as by\nadvection of eddy activity to the extratropics by the\nupper-level mean flow. In our study, we find that in-\ncluding ocean dynamics leads to a poleward shift in the\nmidlatitude storm track, which is broadly consistent\nwith the Orlanski (2005) mechanism, since we see a\nslight equatorial cooling and a weakening of eastern\ntropical Pacific baroclinicity. However, further support\nregarding the details of this mechanism, involving up-\nstream seeding and downstream development, is be-\nyond the scope of this study.\nc. Northward heat transport by the atmosphere\nand ocean\nTo complement our picture of how the surface ther-\nmodynamic processes alter, now consider the 10-yr time-\nmean, zonally integrated atmosphere and ocean north-\nward heat transport (NHT).\nIn the ground state, the total (atmosphere plus ocean)\nNHT reaches up to 5 PW at 358N and, by definition, is\nsolely due to the atmosphere because the slab ocean is\nstatic (Figs. 12a,c, dashed line). In the control state, the\ntotal NHT is enhanced at all latitudes, with a maximum\nvalue of 6 PW at 258N (Fig. 12a, full line). This increase\nin heat transport is achieved by the ocean providing a\nheat transport reaching up to 2 PW in the tropics (Fig. 12e,\nfull line), as well as a slight poleward shift in the maximum\natmospheric heat transport (Fig. 12c). Thus, the total\nNHT is primarily provided by the atmosphere, with the\nocean providing a comparable contribution in the\ntropics (e.g., Held 2001; Czaja and Marshall 2006).\nThis increase in northward total heat transport occurs\nin both model experiments, including a dynamic ocean,\nthe control case (Fig. 12a, full line), and the no-mountains\ncase, identifying the dominant effect of the ocean forcing\n(Fig. 12b). Hence, in these experiments, we do not see the\neffect of the ocean transport being compensated by an\nopposing change in the atmospheric transport, as might\nbe expected if a straightforward Bjerknes compensation\nFIG. 11. Same as in Figs. 5a\u2013f, but for the surface heat flux from\nocean to atmosphere (W m22).\n1 JULY 2009 W I L SON ET AL . 3699\nwas occurring (Bjerknes 1964). Instead, the inclusion of\nthe ocean is altering the background climate state.\nThe atmospheric response to the inclusion of ocean\ndynamics is to carry less heat poleward at low latitudes,\nbut then to carry more heat poleward at mid- to high\nlatitudes (Fig. 12c). Thus, the additional heat carried\npoleward by the ocean at low latitudes is transferred by\nair\u2013sea exchange to the overlying atmosphere at mid-\nlatitudes, and then increases the atmospheric heat\ntransport. The area-integrated atmospheric NHT is\nnearly identical for the ground state and the control,\npartly reflecting the lack of any significant heat storage\nin the atmosphere.\nIn terms of the forcings of the total NHT, ocean dy-\nnamics increase the transport in the tropics between 108\nand 358N, as well as providing a slight weakening\naround 408N and a strengthening around 608N (Fig. 12b,\ndashed line). Introduction of orographic forcing and\nthe interaction term generally have a weak influence\nin the zonal integral of up to 0.3 PW, and do not vary\nmeridionally (Figs. 12b,d). However, the interaction\nterm provides damping of NHT in the North Pacific\nand enhancement in the North Atlantic of up to 0.3-PW\nmagnitude, which cancels in the zonal integral (not\nshown).\nOcean dynamics lead to an ocean NHT of up to 1.8\nPW at 208N, and the interaction with orography pro-\nvides an additional 0.2 PW (Fig. 12f). This low-latitude\nchange due to ocean dynamics alters the SST distribu-\ntion because more heat is transported from the equa-\ntor. However, at midlatitudes around 408N, ocean heat\ntransport becomes small (Fig. 12e) and the atmosphere\ntakes up this heat carried by the ocean and transports\nthe heat poleward in both the mean flow and in the\ntime-varying flow associated with the storm track. The\natmospheric NHT at the storm-track latitudes is shifted\npoleward due to forcing from ocean dynamics (Fig. 12d),\nillustrating that the ocean still has an effect in the total\nNHT despite the ocean NHT being diminished at these\nlatitudes.\n4. Summary and discussion\nA coupled climate model is used to examine the\nindividual effects of ocean dynamics, orography, and\ntheir nonlinear interaction on the storm tracks in the\nNorthern Hemisphere winter. Their separate effects are\ndiagnosed from the differences between model experi-\nments with or without mountains and with a realistic\nocean or a slab ocean.\nIn the model experiment without orography and\nocean dynamics, there is still a storm track, albeit more\nintense and broader than that observed in reality. Hence,\nin these experiments, the maintenance of the storm\ntrack does not need to involve either orographic forcing\nor a supply of heat by ocean western boundary currents,\nand other fundamental processes are at work. The for-\nmation of strong zonal jets and storm tracks may be\nsimply understood as poleward-moving upper air in the\ntropics being zonally deflected by 308N through large-\nscale angular momentum conservation, and then how\nthe strength of these jets is enhanced over the warm,\nmoist ocean and weakened over the land. A more re-\nalistic storm track is obtained as orography and ocean\ndynamics are included: the storm track becomes\nsharper, shifts poleward, and has more along-track\nvariability.\nOcean dynamics transport heat poleward and form\ncharacteristic gyre and overturning circulations. Like\nmost OGCM studies, we do not consider the long time-\nscale variability of the overturning circulation because\nFIG. 12.

These regions of enhanced SST gradi-\nent are also displaced poleward, matching the poleward\nshift in atmospheric baroclinicity.\nOcean transport of heat in the tropics leads to a\npoleward shift in the maximum atmospheric northward\nheat transport: the atmospheric heat transport reduces\nin the tropics and increases in the mid and high lati-\ntudes. Accompanying this poleward shift in the maxi-\nmum atmospheric heat transport is a concomitant shift\nin the midlatitude storm tracks, which is to be expected\nbecause the synoptic-scale eddies are the dominant\nprocess fluxing heat poleward at midlatitudes. The\neffect of the ocean dynamics on the storm track is most\npronounced over the Atlantic basin where the ocean\npoleward heat transport is largest.\nOrography induces along-track variability and dampens\nthe storm track over and downstream of the major\nmountain ranges of the Tibetan Plateau, Rockies, and\nAlps. The orographic forcing is dominated by the effect of\nthe Tibetan Plateau, generating a stationary planetary\nwave train with alternating pressure anomalies, inducing a\nnortheastward tilt over the Pacific storm-track entrance.\nThe interaction between the ocean dynamics and orog-\nraphy often partially cancels the other forcings and is\nimportant only over localized regions, such as enhancing\nthe contrast between the Atlantic and Pacific.\nThe large-scale adjustment to forcing from ocean dy-\nnamics and orography is shown to have a significant\neddy-mediated component, as seen in the E-vector di-\nagnostics. At midlatitudes, ocean and orographic forcing\nacts, via the transient eddy field, to weaken the eastward\neddy-mean acceleration on the jet, and to insert zonal\nasymmetry and tilt to the flow. This eddy forcing causes\nthe jet and storm track to tilt over the Pacific and At-\nlantic, and to shift poleward. In effect, eddies help to\nspread the influence of orographic forcing through changes\nassociated with the generation of a stationary planetary\nwave train from the Tibetan Plateau.\nOur study is also relevant to the question of how\nsurface temperature contrasts across the North Atlantic\nare determined. Seager et al. (2002) argued that the\nwest\u2013east contrasts in air temperature across the North\nAtlantic are not determined by ocean heat transport\nacross the basin, but are instead determined by the\norographically forced atmospheric standing wave pat-\ntern. In our study, ocean dynamics is found to play a\nmore subtle role, tightening the SST gradients on the\nwestern side of ocean basins and increasing the north-\nward heat transport. This change in the surface thermal\nboundary layer is associated with changes in the\noverlying baroclinicity of the atmosphere, leading to\na poleward shift in the mean flow and associated posi-\ntion of the storm track. This connection between ocean\ndynamics and the overlying storm tracks might be fur-\nther enhanced in coupled models with higher ocean\nresolution, which include the extension of the warm\nwestern boundary currents into the basin interior.\nAcknowledgments.
