Introduction \n \nThe seaboard of western Scotland is a classic fjord landscape with a highly indented, glacially \nsculpted coastline that incises landwards into the mountainous hinterland (Fig. 1). The longest \nfjords (or sea lochs) range from 10 to 30 km, and commonly exceed 150 m at their maximum \nwater depth. Maximum-recorded sediment infill (sea bed\u2013rockhead) is between 50 and 70 m \nin Loch Nevis (Boulton et al., 1981) and Loch Etive (Howe et al., 2002), and locally up to \n100 m in Loch Broom (Stoker et al., 2006; Stoker and Bradwell, In press). It has recently \nbeen proposed that the major fjords in NW Scotland most probably formed tributaries that fed \nthe Minch palaeo-ice stream; a shelf-crossing ice-stream that dominated the northwestern \nsector of the British Ice Sheet (BIS) (Stoker and Bradwell, 2005; Bradwell et al., 2007, \n2008c) (Fig. 1). Thus, this landscape has evolved for at least the last 500,000 years; the \ninterval of time that the BIS has repeatedly expanded onto, and retreated from, the adjacent \ncontinental shelf (Stoker et al., 1994). In this paper we examine the glacial geology of the \nfjords in the Summer Isles region of NW Scotland (Figs. 1 and 2), onshore and offshore, in \norder to examine the style of Late Pleistocene deglaciation, the pattern and rates of \nsedimentation, and to further explore palaeo-ice-sheet dynamics during periods of rapid \nglobal climate change.      \n \nDespite their obvious importance as a connection between the terrestrial and marine glacial \nrecords, Scotland\u2019s fjords have received relatively little attention in terms of their glacial \nhistory (Boulton et al., 1981; Dix and Duck, 2000; Howe et al., 2001, 2002; N\u00f8rgaard-\nPedersen et al., 2006; Stoker et al., 2006). This is surprising considering that fjords commonly \nact as effective sediment traps during deglaciation, and have the potential to provide a high-\nresolution sediment record that reflects both local terrestrial and marine processes (Syvitski \nand Shaw, 1995). Land\u2013sea correlation can also be established or enhanced by linkage of \nglacial geomorphological features across the coastline (Dix and Duck, 2000; Bradwell et al., \n2008a, b). Consequently, without considering the fjord landsystem, current understanding of \nthe nature and timing of deglaciation in NW Scotland where glacial deposits are generally \nscarce is likely to remain disconnected and incomplete.  \n \n 2\n69 \n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \n74 \n75 \n76 \n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \nThe fjords of the Summer Isles region provide new insights into Lateglacial (ca 15\u201311 ka BP) \nenvironmental and climatic change. By focusing on the stratigraphical and geomorphological \nexpression of the fjord landsystem we are able to demonstrate the nature and rate of ice-\nmargin decay in the Summer Isles region, which records a transition from ice sheet to fjord to \noutlet glacier. The nature of the climate and its effect on glaciers in Scotland during the \nLateglacial interval remains uncertain. The traditional paradigm is that during the Lateglacial \nInterstadial (Greenland Interstadial 1 (GI-1); 14.7\u201312.9 ka BP; Lowe et al., 2008), glaciers in \nScotland completely or almost completely disappeared. This is thought to have been followed \nby regrowth of a large West Highland ice cap and several satellite ice fields during the \nYounger Dryas Stadial (12.9\u201311.7 ka BP; Greenland Stadial 1, GS-1), locally known in \nBritain as the Loch Lomond Stadial (e.g. Sissons, 1967; Bowen et al., 1986; Lowe et al., \n1994). This concept has recently been challenged on the basis of geomorphological and \ncosmogenic-isotope evidence from NW Scotland, which show that ice-sheet deglaciation was \nongoing during the first half of the Lateglacial Interstadial (14.7-13.7 ka BP) and, by \ninference, that some ice masses probably survived throughout this entire period into the \nYounger Dryas (Bradwell et al., 2008b). We test the hypothesis of \u2018Interstadial ice survival\u2019 \nusing accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating of marine shells together with \nanalysis of microfaunal assemblages in seabed sediment cores recovered from the fjords. All \ndata referred to in this paper are expressed in calendar years (ka BP), and radiocarbon dates \nhave been calibrated, where appropriate, using Fairbanks et al., (2005). \n \n2. Regional setting \n \nFor the purposes of this study, the Summer Isles region is a convenient term to describe all the \nwaters, islands and headlands between the promontories of Rubha R\u00e9idh in the south and \nRubha C\u00f2igeach in the north. The area includes the mountain massifs of Ben M\u00f3r Coigach, \nand An Teallach . In this study, the focus of our investigations is in Loch Broom, Little Loch \nBroom, and the waters around the Summer Isles (Fig. 2). Twelve main islands comprise the \nSummer Isles group: Tanera M\u00f3r, Tanera Beg, Priest Island and Horse Island being the \nlargest, plus a number of skerries. Isle Martin and Gruinard Island are separate outlying \nislands located in Loch Kanaird and Gruinard Bay, respectively. Loch Broom and Little Loch \nBroom represent the major sea lochs or fjords: Loch Broom is 15 km long and 0.5 to 1.5 km \nwide, whereas Little Loch Broom is 12 km long and 0.5 to 2.0 km wide. \n \n 3\n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \n136 \nThe bathymetric image of the Summer Isles region (Fig. 3) reveals the juxtaposition of \nshallow, commonly linear, north-west-trending, submarine banks, less than 40 m below \npresent-day sea level, and deeply incised fjord troughs, up to 180 m deep, with steep sides (5\u2013\n40\u00ba), flat bottoms and undulating thalwegs (lowest point of elevation within the troughs) \n(Stoker et al., 2006). The troughs represent the offshore continuation of the modern sea lochs \nof Loch Broom and Little Loch Broom which, for descriptive purposes, are here separated \ninto a number of discrete basins: the Southeast, South and North Annat basins, and the \nCoigach, Tanera, Skerries and South Priest basins (Figs. 3 and 4). At present-day, the greatest \nwater depths (160\u2013180 m) occur in the South Priest and Skerries basins. Whereas a bedrock \nsill separates Little Loch Broom from the South Priest Basin, there is connectivity between \nsome of the other basins (e.g. South Annat and North Annat basins to Skerries Basin) (Fig. 3) \nin the form of narrow gorges, interpreted as meltwater channels, that are commonly several \nkilometres long and typically have steep up-and-down long profiles (Bradwell et al., 2008a). \nThe whole fjord region is separated from The Minch by a wide zone of bedrock that includes \nthe Summer Isles (Figs. 3 and 4). \n \nThe bedrock geology of the study area is dominated by coarse red, thick-bedded Torridonian \nsandstone of Neoproterozoic age, which forms the bulk of the surrounding mountains, e.g. \nBen M\u00f3r Coigach, Beinn Ghobhlach and An Teallach. Sporadic inliers of Archaean Lewisian \northogneiss occur in places, onto which the Torridonian sandstone was unconformably \ndeposited. A north\u2013south-trending strip of Cambro-Ordovician rocks, mainly quartzite with \nsubordinate carbonate, crops out to the east of Ullapool which is, in turn, tectonically overlain \nby metasediments of the Neoproterozoic Moine Supergroup along the line of the Moine \nThrust Zone (Trewin, 2002). The bedrock is cut by both NE- and NW-trending lineaments. \nThe latter have exerted a control on the orientation of the sea lochs, whereas the intersection \nof lineaments in the outer fjord region has probably controlled the rectilinear pattern of the \nSouth Priest and Skerries basins. \n \nGlaciation has played a major role in landscape development of this region, which preserves a \nstrong imprint of glacial streamlining as well as recessional landforms and deposits. Erosional \nbedrock megagrooves and streamlined subglacial deposits (till blankets) are preserved both \nonshore and offshore (Fig. 3), and have been interpreted as recording the signature of a fast-\nflowing ice-stream tributary that periodically fed the Minch palaeo-ice stream (Stoker et al., \n2006; Bradwell et al., 2007, 2008a). A stacked association of diamicton sequences, up to a \n 4\n137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \ntotal of 90 m thick, and subdivided by discrete erosional surfaces defined by megascale \nglacial lineations (MSGL), comprises this palaeo-ice stream succession, which in this part of \nThe Minch is termed the Fiona sequence (Fyfe et al., 1993; Stoker and Bradwell, 2005) (Figs. \n4 and 5). A major bathymetric high, the Greenstone Ridge, extends NNW from Greenstone \nPoint, and probably represents a large streamlined till complex within the Fiona sequence \n(Bishop and Jones, 1979; Chesher et al., 1983) that formed between the ice-stream tributaries \nemanating from the Loch Broom region and Loch Ewe (Bradwell et al., 2007) (Fig. 4). The \ncoast-parallel Loch Ewe and Rubha C\u00f2igeach moraine suites represent large late-stage \nrecessional moraines of the Fiona sequence. The Loch Ewe moraines have yet to be correlated \nwith equivalent features onshore. This whole suite of moraines was probably deposited at the \nend of a dynamic cycle of palaeo-ice stream collapse in the Minch, between ~ 20 ka BP and \n15 ka BP (Graham et al., 1990; Stoker et al., 2006; Bradwell et al., 2007). \n \nIn The Minch, the Late- to Postglacial record (the Annie sequence: Fig. 5) is a largely \ncondensed sequence (Fyfe et al., 1993). In contrast, a continuous sequence of seafloor \nmoraines (Figs. 3 and 4) extends landwards from offshore Rubha C\u00f2igeach. These almost \ncertainly represent the final retreat of the ice sheet margin across this region (Stoker et al., \n2006). The identification of laterally continuous push moraines and well preserved De Geer \nmoraines suggests that this ice margin was coherent and retreated in a punctuated oscillatory \nmanner (Bradwell et al., 2008b). Several of these seafloor moraines have been traced onshore; \nin particular, a well preserved series of moraines have been mapped around Achiltibuie and \nnear Stattic Point (Figs. 3 and 4). Surface-exposure ages from boulders on these moraines \nimply that a substantial, dynamic, ice cap existed in this region during the Lateglacial \nInterstadial, between ~14 and 13 ka BP (Bradwell et al., 2008b). By contrast, currently \naccepted Younger Dryas Stadial (GS-1) glacier limits are restricted to the high valleys and \ncorries inland of the study area, e.g. An Teallach, Beinn Dearg (cf. Bennett and Boulton, \n1993; Golledge et al., 2008 and references therein) (Fig. 4). \n \nAt the present-day, tidal currents play a key role in the hydrographic regime of the Summer \nIsles region. A strong spring\u2013neap tidal variation has been recorded off NW Scotland.  Near \nSkye this has been measured with a spring range of 4.5 m and a neap range of 1.6 m (Ellett \nand Edwards, 1983). The maximum speed of tidal streams during typical spring tides in this \narea measure 1\u20132 ms-1 (Sager and Sammler, 1968).  \n \n 5\n3.

A marine geophysical survey \nof the Summer Isles region was undertaken in July 2005, and acquired multibeam swath \nbathymetry and high-resolution (boomer) seismic reflection data (Stoker et al., 2006) (Fig. 2). \nBathymetric data were acquired across an area of 225 km2 using a GeoSwath system \noperating at 125 kHz, mounted on a retractable bow pole on the R\/V Calanus. The data were \ncollected on a GeoSwath computer with post-acquisition processing carried out on a separate \nworkstation. Fifty seven boomer profiles (total length of about 235 km) were acquired using a \nBGS-owned Applied Acoustics surface-towed boomer and hydrophone. The data were \nrecorded and processed (Time Varied Gain, Bandpass Filter 800\u2013200 Hz) on a CODA DA200 \nseismic acquisition system. Further technical details of the acquisition are outlined in Stoker \net al. (2006).  \n \nSeismic stratigraphy (cf. Mitchum et al., 1977; Sangree and Widmier 1977) forms the basis of \nthe subdivision of the fjord infill. This has been combined with lithologic (offshore and \nonshore), biostratigraphic and radiometric data (see below) to develop the stratigraphic \nframework (Fig. 5; Table 1), for which a lithostratigraphic nomenclature scheme has been \nadopted. This ensures continuity between the onshore and offshore successions. Sound \nvelocities in the fjord infill are taken to be in the range of 1500\u20132000 ms-1 depending upon \ntheir composition and degree of induration (McQuillin and Ardus, 1977; Stoker et al., 1994). \nThe conversion of sub-bottom depths from milliseconds to metres has been generally taken as \na maximum estimate (i.e. 20 ms two-way travel time (TWTT) \u226420 m) of sediment thickness. \nHowever, for high-resolution correlation between the boomer profiles and basinal sediment \ncores a sound velocity of 1500\u20131600 ms-1 is most appropriate. The relief of features with \nexpression at the sea bed is based on the sound velocity in water of 1450 ms-1 (Hamilton \n1985). \n \nGeological calibration of the geophysical data was established during two sampling cruises \nundertaken in August 2006 and September 2007, using the R\/V Calanus and the R\/V James \nCook, respectively, which recovered sediment cores from 50 sample stations (Fig. 2). These \ncruises utilised the SAMS 3-m gravity corer (2006) and the BGS 6-m vibrocorer and 15-m \nrock drill (2007). All of the cores have been examined in terms of their sedimentology. A \n 6\n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \n217 \n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \ntransect of seven cores representative of the inner and outer fjord region were examined in \ndetail in this study, in terms of their lithology, sedimentary structure and microfaunal content \n(Fig. 6; Table 2). However, the entire core database was utilised in the development of the \nlithostratigraphic framework presented herein.  \n \nTwenty-one samples were analysed for their foraminiferal content (Table 3), with specimens \npicked from dry residues. Up to a maximum of 300 specimens were counted for the \nforaminifera, although in some cases entire populations were identified where the counts were \nsmaller and the fauna were impoverished. A number of single and paired bivalve mollusc \nshells were identified and several were used to obtain accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) \nradiocarbon ages (Table 4). Whole single valves of Glossus humanus and Nucula sulcata, and \na paired shell of Lucinoma borealis were sampled from SAMS core GC101, whereas a large \npaired shell of Arctica islandica was recovered from core BGS 57-06\/279, and single valves \nof Arctica islandica and Chlamys islandica were taken from BGS core 57-06\/267. The shells \nare mostly well preserved and non-abraded, the exception being Chlamys islandica that shows \nminor abrasion on the edge. These samples were subsequently prepared for dating at the \nNatural Environment Research Council Radiocarbon Laboratory at East Kilbride, UK. All \noffshore 14C dates reported here are corrected with a marine reservoir age of 405\u00b140 yr \n(Harkness, 1983), and calibrated to calendar years (Table 4) based on the Fairbanks0107 \ncalibration curve (Fairbanks et al., 2005).  \n \nOnshore mapping was carried out using a combination of digital and traditional data-capture \ntechniques. Geomorphological features and superficial deposits were mapped onscreen in a \nGIS using 1:10,000-scale stereo- and monoscopic colour aerial photographs and high-\nresolution digital surface models (NEXTMap Britain). In general, hillshaded NEXTMap data \nwere used to highlight areas of interest, typically at ~1:20,000; these were then mapped in \ndetail using orthorectified colour aerial photographs at ~1:5000.  Geological field surveys of \nkey areas were conducted between May 2004 and 2009.  \n \n4. Results \n \nThe seismic, lithological and palaeontological characteristics of the fjord stratigraphy, both \nonshore and offshore, are summarised below and in Table 1. The radiocarbon analyses are \npresented at the end of the section.   \n 7\n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n \n4.1. Fjord stratigraphy \n \nThe fjord succession is divided into five main lithostratigraphic formations: 1) Loch Broom \nTill Formation (oldest); 2) Assynt Glacigenic Formation; 3) Annat Bay Formation; 4) \nUllapool Gravel Formation; and, 5) Summer Isles Formation (Fig. 5). Of these, only the \nAnnat Bay and Summer Isles Formations are exclusively offshore units. The Assynt \nGlacigenic Formation includes four locally defined members: the Allt na h-Airbhe, Allt an t-\nSrathain, and Rhiroy members in Loch Broom, and the Rireavach Member in Little Loch \nBroom (Fig. 4). In addition, we have identified two lithogenetic units \u2013 \u2018Late-stage debris \nflows\u2019 and the \u2018Inner and Outer Loch Broom shell beds\u2019 \u2013 that are locally mappable deposits, \nbut are not easily correlatable to specific formations. Although coastal exposures of the Loch \nBroom Till, Assynt Glacigenic and Ullapool Gravel Formations are included to assist the \ndescription and interpretation of these units, younger terrestrial paraglacial and postglacial \ndeposits are not considered in this paper.  \n \nSeismic reflection profiles (Figs. 7\u201310) reveal the distribution, geometry and internal \ncharacter of the various units that comprise the fjord succession, which is commonly up to 60 \nm thick in the overdeepened basins. Beneath the shallow banks, the bedrock surface is \ngenerally discernible as a high-amplitude reflector at the base of the glacial succession (Fig. \n8a). In contrast, the nature of the acoustic basement in the basins is more chaotic in texture, \nand irregular in form towards the base of the fjord. The possible occurrence of stacked, \ncompacted till, or mass-flow deposits derived from the sidewall of the fjord prior to the \ndeposition of the main basin infill, makes it locally difficult to determine the seismic \nboundary between diamicton or bedrock (e.g. Figs. 9 and 10). The presence of shallow gas in \nsome of the basins also obscures the seismic layering of the basinal sediments in places \n(Stoker et al., 2006).  \n \nDetails of each stratigraphic unit in ascending stratigraphic order are presented below and \nsummarised in Tables 1 and 5. Key aspects such as sedimentological properties and \npalaeontological data, where available, are emphasised. There is no evidence of major \nreworking of the fjord succession by glacigenic processes; thus, the faunas are considered to \nbe predominantly in situ. Although The Minch succession is mostly separated from the fjord \nregion by a wide zone of bedrock (Fig. 4), there is some overlap between the outer moraine \n 8\n273 \n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \nlimit of the Assynt Glacigenic Formation and the Fiona sequence (Fig. 5), which is also \ndescribed below.  \n \n4.1.1. Loch Broom Till Formation \n \nThe Loch Broom Till Formation forms a discontinuous, overconsolidated, till sheet, up to 20 \nm thick, overlying bedrock. Offshore, it is best observed on bathymetric highs (Figs. 7 and 8). \nThe surface morphology of the Loch Broom Till Formation is characteristically streamlined \nwith lineations trending broadly NW, in common with the surrounding streamlined bedrock \nfeatures \u2013 best observed as large-scale roches moutonnees, streamlined bedrock hills and \nmegagrooves (Bradwell et al., 2008a). This is well illustrated in the combined topographic-\nbathymetric surface model which reveals pronounced streamlining of the till blanket on the \nflanks of outer Little Loch Broom extending offshore beyond Stattic Point and Cailleach \nHead (Figs. 3 and 4).  \n \nThe Loch Broom Till Formation principally comprises diamictons displaying a strong, \nsubhorizontal fabric (Table 1). Onshore, at the type-site at Allt an t-Srathain [NC 1085 9673] \n(Fig. 4), a vertical thickness of 3.5 m of the Loch Broom Till Formation is exposed along a 30 \nm transect downstream. The grey, clay-rich, diamicton preserves a strong subhorizontal \nWNW-oriented clast fabric, with bullet-shaped and faceted clasts (Fig. 11e). At Allt an t-\nSrathain, clast lithologies typify the bedrock geology immediately east of the area, with a \npredominance of Moine psammites, followed by secondary abundance of Eriboll sandstones \n(quartzites) and Torridon Group sandstones. Further onshore exposures of Loch Broom Till \nFormation are relatively sparse, although good sections can be seen in Auchlunachan Burn \nwhere an 8-m thickness is exposed; near Badrallach campsite; and along the coast from Stattic \nPoint overlooking Gruinard Island (Fig. 4).  At all these localities, the Loch Broom Till \nFormation displays broadly similar sedimentological properties but becomes increasingly \nTorridonian-sandstone-dominated and redder in matrix colour with distance west. Offshore, in \nGruinard Bay, BGS core 57-06\/256 recovered a 1.52 m-thick section of diamicton dominated \nby Torridonian sandstone clasts (Fig. 11f). The internal seismic character of the Loch Broom \nTill Formation is variable (Table 1); however, the occurrence of sub-parallel, flat-lying, \nreflections on Martin Bank (Fig. 8) is consistent with an internal shear fabric. No fossils have \nbeen found in this unit.  \n \n 9\n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \n315 \n316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n331 \n332 \n333 \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \n340 \nOn the basis of its sedimentology, and morphostratigraphic expression, the Loch Broom Till \nFormation is interpreted as a subglacial lodgement till. Although it is separated from The \nMinch by a wide zone of bedrock (Fig. 4), it is most likely correlated with the upper part of \nthe Fiona sequence, which preserves streamlined MSGLs locally at the top (present-day sea \nbed) of a palaeo-ice stream diamicton sequence (Stoker and Bradwell, 2005; Bradwell et al., \n2007). \n \n4.1.2. Assynt Glacigenic Formation      \n \nThe Assynt Glacigenic Formation is the most extensive Quaternary deposit in the Summer \nIsles region (Figs. 4 and 5), ranging from a discontinuous onshore veneer to thick infill \ndeposits in the adjacent offshore basins (Table 1; Figs. 7\u201310). A major characteristic of this \nunit on- and offshore is its well-developed moraine system. The scale and nature of the \nmoraine morphology varies: on the northern flanks of Loch Lurgainn, around Achiltibuie, and \non the southern slopes of Little Loch Broom (Figs. 3 and 4) morainic mounds and ridges are \nbest developed where the glacigenic sediments exceed ~2 m in thickness. By comparison, \nmoraines on Martin Bank and Cadail Bank are 1\u201320 m high, range from a few hundred metres \nto ~ 3 km in length, and most display spacings of 100\u20131000 m (Stoker et al., 2006). Some of \nthese moraines can be traced into, and locally across, the adjacent basins (Fig. 4). Intricate \nplan morphologies (Fig. 3) and asymmetric cross-profiles (e.g. Fig. 8a) led Bradwell et al. \n(2008b) to interpret these features as recessional push moraines and, in places, De Geer \nmoraines. Several of the seabed ridges can be traced to join with moraines onshore. As a \nmappable unit offshore, the Assynt Glacigenic Formation is most easily recognised on \nseismic profiles landward of the Summer Isles bedrock zone (Fig. 4). However, the swath \nbathymetric data reveal that the recessional moraines characteristic of this unit extend to ca 5 \nkm west of the bedrock zone, where they are delicate features superimposed on bedrock and \non an older sequence of more substantial moraines \u2013 the Rubha  C\u00f2igeach\u2013Loch Ewe \nmoraines \u2013 associated with the uppermost part of the Fiona sequence (Figs. 4 and 12). \nConsequently, we interpret the outermost of the younger moraine sequence to mark the \noffshore limit of the Assynt Glacigenic Formation.  \n \nOn Martin Bank, numerous smaller ridges (Fig. 8a) occur in the spaces between the main \nridges, buried below a more acoustically isotropic infill (see below). These are several metres \nhigh and spaced at intervals of <100 m. It is uncertain whether or not these are smaller \n 10\n341 \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n349 \n350 \n351 \n352 \n353 \n354 \n355 \n356 \n357 \n358 \n359 \n360 \n361 \n362 \n363 \n364 \n365 \n366 \n367 \n368 \n369 \n370 \n371 \n372 \n373 \n374 \nrecessional end-moraine ridges or subglacial crevasse-squeeze ridges. Their position is taken \nto mark the approximate contact zone between the Loch Broom Till and Assynt Glacigenic \nFormations on Martin Bank; perhaps marking the top of a zone of reworking of the former \nunit, where internal reflections in the Loch Broom Till Formation appear to be truncated. This \nbasal deposit has been sampled in BGS core 57-06\/262 (Figs. 6, 8 and 11c), which recovered \n0.64 m of massive, sandy diamicton, with randomly orientated clasts of mainly Moine \nlithologies up to cobble grade (<8 cm). This diamicton facies has also been sampled in BGS \ncores 57-06\/263 and 57-06\/271 further to the southeast on Martin Bank (Fig. 8), and is \nexposed onshore at Allt an t-Srathain [NC1085 9673] and Badrallach [NH0640 9155] (Fig. \n4), amongst other places. Sections at Allt an t-Srathain reveal a red-brown silty sandy \ndiamicton with a weakly developed clast fabric (Figs. 4 and 11b). By association, and given \nthe lateral continuity of the geomorphic features from onshore to offshore, we interpret the \ndiamicton within the Assynt Glacigenic Formation as till and morainic debris deposited \nduring overall ice-front retreat, in both subaqueous and terrestrial settings.  \n   \nOn the submarine banks, massive and colour-laminated clay and silty clay with sporadic \ndropstones occurs as contemporary partial infill deposits, up to about 10 m thick (Table 1). \nThese lie ponded between the moraine ridges (Fig. 8). In BGS core 57-06\/262, the \nlaminations alternate between grey and grey-brown, and range from 2 to10 mm in thickness \n(Fig. 11c). Clay and silty clay also dominate the basins, which display a variable infill \ncharacter (Table 1; Figs. 7-10). In the North Annat Basin, BGS core 57-06\/279 (Fig. 6) \npenetrated 3.3 m of dropstone clay with common shell fragments, including a paired valve of \nA. islandica. In the Tanera Basin, SAMS core GC101 (Fig. 6) recovered 1.39 m of soft, \nmassive clay, which included a paired valve of L. borealis. BGS cores 57-06\/262 and 279 \nrevealed very sparse foraminiferal assemblages, but included the cold-water, Arctic to high \nboreal, species Pyrgo williamsoni (cf. Murray, 1991) throughout the Assynt Glacigenic \nFormation in core 57-06\/279, with rare temperate and boreal indicators such as Ammonia \nbeccarii and Trifarina angulosa (cf. Haynes, 1973; Murray 1991), in the upper part of both \ncores (Table 3). The recovered bivalves are indicative of a boreal setting. Collectively, these \nare interpreted to be ice-proximal glacimarine sediments, deposited in a cold but not fully \nArctic environment.  \n \nIn the outer part of Loch Broom, BGS core 57-06\/269 recovered 3.28 m of colour-laminated \nclay with sporadic thin beds of very fine-grained sand (Fig. 6). The laminae are highly \n 11\n375 \n376 \n377 \n378 \n379 \n380 \n381 \n382 \n383 \n384 \n385 \n386 \n387 \n388 \n389 \n390 \n391 \n392 \n393 \n394 \n395 \n396 \n397 \n398 \n399 \n400 \n401 \n402 \n403 \n404 \n405 \n406 \n407 \n408 \ndisturbed and contorted, and sporadically displaced along micro-faults; a response to syn- to \nearly post-depositional slumping within the basin infill (Stoker and Bradwell, 2009) (Fig. 9a). \nMajor sliding and slumping has also occurred in the North Annat Basin and Little Loch \nBroom (Figs. 8 and 10). In the North Annat Basin, this occurred prior to the deposition of the \noverlying Annat Bay Formation (see below). In the outer part of Little Loch Broom, \ndeformation has been more pervasive, with total reworking of the upper part of the Assynt \nGlacigenic Formation through a series of slide and mass-flow events that collectively form \nthe Little Loch Broom slide complex (Fig. 10). This entire mass-flow package has been \nassigned as the Rireavach Member of the Assynt Glacigenic Formation (Table 1). The \ndetailed sedimentology and regional significance of the slide complex are described elsewhere \n(Stoker et al., in press).  \n \nCoarser-grained basinal sediments have only been sampled in Loch Broom and Little Loch \nBroom (Table 1). In inner Loch Broom, the base of BGS core 57-06\/267 penetrated 0.54 m \ninto massive sand with scattered shell fragments (Fig. 6) but barren of foraminifera (Table 3). \nIn the outer part of Little Loch Broom, alternating thinly-bedded (10\u201350 mm) colour \nlaminated mud and sand with sporadic pebbles was proved in several cores, including SAMS \ncores GC 112, 113, 116 and 120, which penetrated the pre-slide deposits, below the Rireavach \nMember (Fig. 10).  \n \nIn Loch Broom, a discrete, irregular, sheet-like deposit up to about 7 m thick marks the \nuppermost part of the basin infill. This deposit can be traced from the deeper-water part of the \nouter loch into the shallower inner loch, and has been divided into two members, the Allt na \nh-Airbhe and Rhiroy members, which are separated by a distinct submarine moraine ridge \nbetween Rhiroy and Leckmelm (Figs. 9b, and 13). The Allt na h-Airbhe Member is the older \nof the two units, and extends westward from this moraine ridge into the outer part of Loch \nBroom (Fig. 9). Seismic profiles show that thin debris-flow deposits mark the seaward extent \nof this member in the deeper outer part of the loch. Between Corry Point and Ullapool, where \nthe Allt na h-Airbhe Member is exposed at sea bed, the surface morphologies associated with \nthe unit are characteristic of an ice-contact assemblage; including deep enclosed basins \n(?kettle holes) and glacitectonic ice-contact ridges (Fig. 13). The latter are developed offshore \nCorry Point and Rubha Buidhe where they range from 10\u201320 m high, 100\u2013500 m wide, and \nform domed and flat-topped ridges. These ridges display curvilinear axial crests orientated \noblique to the margins of Loch Broom. On seismic profiles the internal acoustic character of \n 12\n409 \n410 \n411 \n412 \n413 \n414 \n415 \n416 \n417 \n418 \n419 \n420 \n421 \n422 \n423 \n424 \n425 \n426 \n427 \n428 \n429 \n430 \n431 \n432 \n433 \n434 \n435 \n436 \n437 \n438 \n439 \n440 \n441 \n442 \nthe ridges shows a rapid lateral change from a structureless to an obliquely layered \nconfiguration, with discontinuous dipping reflectors that transect the unit, and locally appear \nto link into a d\u00e9collement surface at its base (Fig. 13a). We interpret these reflectors to \nindicate glaciotectonic thrusting within the Allt na h-Airbhe Member. SAMS cores GC125 \nand 126 failed to penetrate more than 20 cm into overcompacted sandy gravel on the flank of \nthe ridge offshore Rubha Buidhe (Fig. 13).  \n \nThe Rhiroy Member is restricted to inner Loch Broom, landward of the submarine moraine \nridge (Figs. 9b and 13), and displays a seismic character typical of a diamicton (Table 1; Fig. \n9b). This was confirmed by BGS core 57-06\/267, which recovered a 1.34 m-thick muddy and \nshelly diamicton, including a single whole valve of the bivalve Mya truncata (Fig. 6). The \nRhiroy Member rests with erosional contact on the underlying basin fill, and, where proved \nby core data, overlies the Inner Loch Broom shell bed (see below: section 4.1.5) (Figs. 5, 6 \nand 9b). Its extent further landward within Loch Broom is obscured by shallow gas (Fig. 9). \nAll of these data suggest that the Allt na h-Airbhe and Rhiroy members represent relatively \nrestricted, late-stage readvances of outlet glacier lobes into Loch Broom.  \n \nOnshore sedimentological evidence for late-stage readvances is seen at four key localities \nadjacent to Loch Broom: Newton Loggie [NC 1400 9148], Allt an t-Srathain [NC 1085 9673], \nand Allt Ardcharnich [NH 1771 8891] and one adjacent to Little Loch Broom [NH 0648 \n9165] (Fig. 14a\u2013e). Natural exposures in the prominent, wedge-shaped, drift complex beneath \nCreag an Tairbh, adjacent to Newton Loggie (Fig. 14b), reveal >4 m of massive and sheared \ndiamicton, overlain by 3\u20134 m of normally graded interlaminated sand-silt-clay, in turn \noverlain by 3\u20134 m of stratified, fining-upwards, matrix-rich gravel packages containing a high \nproportion of striated and bullet-shaped clasts. Within the fine-grained interlaminated \nsequence are occasional dropstones and thin (<0.3 m) discontinuous muddy gravel units. The \nwhole fine-grained sequence shows clear evidence of deformation (Figs. 11d and 14b) \nincluding: disrupted and convolute bedding; normal and reverse faulting on a range of scales \n(~mm to ~0.5 m offsets); pods and intraclasts of other soft-sediment units; loading and water-\nescape structures. Although the exact facies relationships within the Creag an Tairbh drift \ncomplex remain uncertain, the massive basal diamicton is correlated with the Loch Broom \nTill Formation, whereas all the overlying sediments are placed within the Assynt Glacigenic \nFormation. The geomorphological expression of the sediment wedge beneath Craig an Tairbh \nand the lack of an apparent source for the debris-flow material, combined with the diversity of \n 13\n443 \n444 \n445 \n446 \n447 \n448 \n449 \n450 \n451 \n452 \n453 \n454 \n455 \n456 \n457 \n458 \n459 \n460 \n461 \n462 \n463 \n464 \n465 \n466 \n467 \n468 \n469 \n470 \n471 \n472 \n473 \n474 \n475 \n476 \nsediment facies, and the clear evidence for strong constructional deformation throughout the \nlower half of the sediment pile all suggest ice-contact deposition \u2013 first subglacial, then \nsubaqueous, then subaerial \u2013 immediately adjacent to an oscillating ice margin.  \n \nA glacial readvance event is recorded in a natural section at Badrallach, on the shore of Little \nLoch Broom [NH 0648 9165] (Fig. 14d). Here, glaciotectonic (excavational) deformation and \ndewatering of an extremely well-consolidated, grey-brown, glacial diamicton (Loch Broom \nTill Formation) has occurred during emplacement of the overlying, well-consolidated, red-\nbrown, diamicton (Assynt Glacigenic Formation). A sharp erosional contact separates the two \ntills attesting to excavation of the lower substrate prior to, or during, deposition of the upper \n\u2018readvance\u2019 till.  \n \nAt Allt an t-Srathain, the uppermost 1 to 3 m-thick glacial diamicton, here termed the Allt an \nt-Srathain Member overlies and, in places, has extensively reworked and deformed the \nunderlying poorly sorted cobble gravel deposits of the Ullapool Gravel Formation (see section \n4.1.6) (Fig. 14c). The degree of reworking ranges from a subtle re-alignment of gravel clasts \n(i.e. a flattening of dip direction) to a pervasive deformation of the whole 1\u20132 m thick gravel \nunit, including incorporation of rip-up clasts, compressional fold structures, and sediment-\nfilled shear planes. The degree of deformation appears to decrease with depth, suggesting that \nemplacement of the overriding diamicton was responsible for the deformation structures. We \nrelate this facies assemblage to constructional glaciotectonic deformation associated with a \nlocal readvance of the ice margin over glaciofluvial outwash. The limit of the readvance is \nclearly marked by the outer edge of the bulldozed mass of sediment, onlapping a raised (+15 \nm OD) deltaic deposit, into which the modern river is actively eroding.  \n \nAt Allt Ardcharnich, 2 m of clay-rich diamicton with a predominance of striated clasts \noverlies at least 3 m of finely laminated lacustrine silt and clay with occasional sand laminae \nand dropstones, which, in turn, overlies a well-consolidated massive grey diamicton (Loch \nBroom Till Formation) (Fig. 14e). The upper diamicton has well-preserved deformation \nstructures including sediment-filled water escape conduits; rip-up clasts of the underlying \nlaminated silt; and steeply inclined shear planes and kink folds. The top of the laminated \nsediments is also deformed. The upper diamicton is interpreted as a subglacial till relating to a \nlate-stage readvance of glaciers across glaciolacustrine deposits. The upper till at Ardcharnich \nmay correlate stratigraphically with the Allt na h-Airbhe, Allt an t-Srathain or Rhiroy \n 14\n477 \n478 \n479 \n480 \n481 \n482 \n483 \n484 \n485 \n486 \n487 \n488 \n489 \n490 \n491 \n492 \n493 \n494 \n495 \n496 \n497 \n498 \n499 \n500 \n501 \n502 \n503 \n504 \n505 \n506 \n507 \n508 \n509 \n510 \nMembers, or may relate to a minor readvance following the deposition of these glacigenic \nmembers.      \n \n4.1.3. Annat Bay Formation \n \nThe Annat Bay Formation is a basinal deposit that forms a partial, asymmetric, infill to the \ndeep-water basins outside of Loch Broom, as well as the deep inner part of Little Loch Broom \n(Fig. 4). It commonly onlaps the margins of the basins, and displays an angular discordance \nwith the underlying Assynt Glacigenic Formation (Figs. 7, 8 and 10). In the North Annat \nBasin, the Annat Bay Formation onlaps onto erosional scarps formed by sliding and mass \nfailure within the Assynt Glacigenic Formation (Fig. 8).  \n \nIn the North Annat Basin, BGS cores 59-06\/277 and 59-06\/278 recovered silty clay, with \nscattered shell fragments (Table 1; Fig. 6). The same facies was also recovered in SAMS core \nGC102 at the southeast end of the North Annat Basin (Fig. 8); from the Skerries Basin in \nSAMS core GC110 (Fig. 7); and in SAMS core GC089 in inner Little Loch Broom (Fig. 10). \nForaminiferal analysis of BGS core 59-06\/277 revealed a mixed environmental assemblage, \nwith common cold-water species, such as Haynesina orbiculare that lives in Arctic waters \ntoday (Haynes, 1973), alongside warmer water indicators, such as A. beccarii and \nSpiroplectammina wrighti (cf. Haynes, 1973), with the temperate species becoming more \ndominant towards the top of the formation (Table 3). Temperate species, including A. \nbeccarii, Quinqueloculina seminulum and Hyalina baltica (cf. Murray, 1991), are \npredominant in BGS core 57-06\/278, though both the abundance and the diversity of the \nassemblage are, again, greatest near the top of the unit. \n \nThe geometry of the Annat Bay Formation is characteristic of modern glaciated fjords, where \nsediment dispersal from plumes is affected by the Coriolis force, thereby forcing deposition \nonto one side of the depositional basin (Syvitski, 1989). Its absence in Loch Broom and the \nouter part of Little Loch Broom is consistent with sediment derivation from a local source, i.e. \na fjord glacier-margin, though the absence of dropstones sampled in any of the cores suggests \nthat the unit was deposited in an ice-distal glacimarine setting. The mix of temperate and \ncold\u2013arctic foraminiferal species implies a mixing of both Atlantic and Arctic water masses \nduring deposition (Kristensen et al., 2000). At the present day, A. beccarii and H. orbiculare \nare occasionally found living together in areas such as Nova Scotia, where the seasonal \n 15\n511 \n512 \n513 \n514 \n515 \n516 \n517 \n518 \n519 \n520 \n521 \n522 \n523 \n524 \n525 \n526 \n527 \n528 \n529 \n530 \n531 \n532 \n533 \n534 \n535 \n536 \n537 \n538 \n539 \n540 \n541 \n542 \n543 \n544 \nenvironmental conditions (temperature, salinity) vary considerably (Robertson and Mann, \n1980; Scott et al., 1980). \n \n4.1.4. Late-stage debris flows (lithogenetic unit)  \n \nA number of discrete, localised, basin-floor wedges occur on the flanks of several basins, \nincluding outer Loch Broom, inner Little Loch Broom, Coigach Basin, and South and South-\nEast Annat basins. They generally occur sandwiched between the Annat Bay and Summer \nIsles Formations (e.g. Fig. 10), though where the former is absent they separate the Assynt \nGlacigenic and Summer Isles Formations (e.g. Fig. 9). Their seismic character and geometry \n(Table 1) is a characteristic acoustic response of debris-flow deposits (Nardin et al., 1979; \nEmbley, 1980). This is consistent with their lithofacies characteristics, which includes soft, \npebbly, muddy diamicton recovered in SAMS core GC123 in Loch Broom (Fig. 9), and \nfolded beds of clay and sandy silt with intraclasts of muddy sand in SAMS core GC092 in \nLittle Loch Broom (Fig. 10) (Stoker et al., in press).  \n \n4.1.5. Inner and Outer Loch Broom shell beds (lithogenetic unit) \n \nThis lithogenetic unit is presently only recognised in Loch Broom where it has been sampled \nin BGS core 57-06\/269 in the outer loch (Outer Loch Broom shell bed, 0.68 m thick), and 57-\n06\/267 in the inner loch (Inner Loch Broom shell bed, 0.64 m thick) (Figs. 6 and 9).  \nThe shell beds are divisible into three subunits or subfacies (Table 1), of which the lower and \nmiddle sections are comparable in both cores, but the upper sections are different. The basal \nmuddy sand\/sandy mud section contains common whole and fragmented shells of C. \nislandica and A. islandica, whereas the middle section comprises a denser hash with a \npredominance of large single valves of C. islandica and subordinate Tridonta elliptica, which \nshow evidence of boring, abrasion and encrustation. The shells are randomly orientated in \nboth of these sections. In core 57-06\/269, the upper section contains abundant gravel clasts \nmixed with whole and fragmented shells, including T. elliptic, whereas in core 57-06\/267, it \nconsists of a crudely bedded accumulation of subhorizontally aligned shells, dominated by C. \nislandica. The abundance of shell material contained within the shell bed contrasts markedly \nwith the underlying deposits of the Assynt Glacigenic Formation, where shell material is \neither absent (57-06\/269) or much reduced in abundance and lacking C. islandica (57-\n06\/267).  \n 16\n545 \n546 \n547 \n548 \n549 \n550 \n551 \n552 \n553 \n554 \n555 \n556 \n557 \n558 \n559 \n560 \n561 \n562 \n563 \n564 \n565 \n566 \n567 \n568 \n569 \n570 \n571 \n572 \n573 \n574 \n575 \n576 \n577 \n578 \n \nForaminiferal analysis of the shell beds revealed mixed assemblages (Table 3). In the Outer \nLoch Broom shell bed, core 57-06\/269 proved a warm water assemblage including an \nabundance of A. beccarii together with species such as Bulimina elongata (cf. Haynes, 1973; \nMurray, 1985, 1991) and H. baltica intermixed with the presence of the cold-water species H. \norbiculare, Elphidium incertum and Elphidium excavatum clavatum (cf. Wilkinson, 1979; \nMurray, 1991). In core 57-06\/267, the Inner Loch Broom shell bed contained very rare E. \nexcavatum clavatum mixed with more common warmer water species, including Q. \nseminulum and Cibicides lobatulus.  \n \nOn the basis of their stratigraphic context, these shell beds are correlated to form part of the \nsame lithogenetic unit, which we interpret as an environmentally condensed section (sensu \nKidwell, 1998) that accumulated under highly variable and fluctuating environmental \nconditions. The beds probably represent in situ death assemblages, dominated by the bivalve \nC. islandica, whose abundance is comparable to modern Canadian Arctic fjords where \nextensive concentrations form shell pavements on the floor of the fjord (Dale et al., 1989). \nThe possible significance of the gravel-rich upper section of the Outer Loch Broom shell bed \nis discussed further in section 5.1.  \n \n4.1.6. Ullapool Gravel Formation \n \nThe Ullapool Gravel Formation is a fluvioglacial highstand deposit, dominated by cobble-\ngrade gravel (Table 1; Fig. 11a), occurring in coastal locations within the study area \u2013 most \nnotably around the margins of Loch Broom, Little Loch Broom and Loch Kanaird (Fig. 4). \nThe fan-deltas at Ullapool and Newton Loggie, in Loch Broom, form two of the most \ndistinctive onshore occurrences of this unit, the limits of which have been extended offshore \ninto the loch using swath bathymetric data (Fig. 13). The Ullapool fan-delta is a large >30 m \nthick sandy gravel accumulation that progrades into the fjord, more than halfway across Loch \nBroom. Swath bathymetry and boomer profiles indicate that this fan-delta deposit oversteps, \nand therefore post-dates, the ice-contact geomorphology associated with the Allt na h-Airbhe \nMember of the Assynt Glacigenic Formation (Figs. 9 and 13). However, 2 km to the NW, a \nsimilar fan-delta within the Ullapool Gravel Formation is locally overlain and reworked by \nthe glacigenic Allt an t-Srathain Member (Fig. 14c). The geometry of these fan-delta deposits \nhas been further modified by post-depositional changes in relative sea level. The Ullapool \n 17\n579 \n580 \n581 \n582 \n583 \n584 \n585 \n586 \n587 \n588 \n589 \n590 \n591 \n592 \n593 \n594 \n595 \n596 \n597 \n598 \n599 \n600 \n601 \n602 \n603 \n604 \n605 \n606 \n607 \n608 \n609 \n610 \n611 \n612 \nfan-delta preserves former shorelines at approximately +15 m, +5 m, present-day (i.e. 0 m), \nand \u201310 m OD (Fig. 13). The raised sea-level evidence is also observed onshore at Rhue and \nNewton Loggie; however, a submerged surface offshore Newton Loggie at ca. \u201320 m (Fig. \n13b) may relate to an early subaqueous ice-contact stage in fan-delta development. One \noffshore core \u2013 SAMS core GC129 (Fig. 13) \u2013 tested the submerged fan-delta offshore \nNewton Loggie and proved 0.29 m of gravel in a muddy sandy matrix. The top of this \nsubmerged fan-delta has been reworked and moulded into several large sediment waves, up to \n70 m wide and 5 m high. Partial burial by a discontinuous veneer of gravelly muddy sand \n(SAMS core GC129: Summer Isles Formation?) indicates that these waves are not active, and \ntherefore not part of the present-day hydrodynamic regime (see section 5.2). \n \n4.1.7. Summer Isles Formation \n \nThe Summer Isles Formation occurs widely throughout the offshore region, being thickest in \nthe basins but occurs as a seismically unresolvable lag deposit on shallow banks (Table 1). In \nthe basins, the contact with the underlying Annat Bay Formation (and older units) is \ncommonly an erosional unconformity (Fig. 7b); the top of the unit is marked by the present-\nday sea bed, which is also locally an erosional surface on the flanks of the basins, and on or \nadjacent to intrabasinal highs where discrete scours are developed (Figs. 7 and 8b). The effect \nof shallow gas release from the basins is also noted at the sea bed by the localised \ndevelopment of pockmarks (Stoker et al., 2006) (Fig. 8b).  \n \nThe thickest accumulations of the Summer Isles Formation occur in Loch Broom, where its \nmounded seismic character, geometry and lithofacies (Table 1), together with rapid lateral \nchanges in thickness (Fig. 9), resemble sediment drift deposits (Faug\u00e8res et al., 1999; Stow et \nal., 2002). In Loch Broom, a thin basal unit occupies localised scours cut into the underlying \nAssynt Glacigenic Formation (Stoker and Bradwell, 2009), and is downlapped by the thicker \nand more prominent drift-like deposits (Fig. 9b). This basal unit was sampled in BGS core 57-\n06\/267, which proved a 0.16 m-thick shell hash, including several large valves of A. \nislandica, overlain by an ~ 0.3 m-thick medium- to coarse-grained, muddy, slightly gravelly \nand shelly sand, which grades upwards into silty clay at about 1.6 m depth in the core (Fig. 6). \nThe numerous BGS and SAMS penetrating this unit show that the silty clay lithofacies, with \nsporadic shells and organic material, forms the main component of the Summer Isles \nFormation within the basins.  \n 18\n613 \n614 \n615 \n616 \n617 \n618 \n619 \n620 \n621 \n622 \n623 \n624 \n625 \n626 \n627 \n628 \n629 \n630 \n631 \n632 \n633 \n634 \n635 \n636 \n637 \n638 \n639 \n640 \n641 \n642 \n643 \n644 \n645 \n \nMicrofaunal analysis of the basinal sediments of the Summer Isles Formation provided a \nvariable record of foraminiferal assemblages. BGS cores 57-06\/277, 57-06\/278 and 57-06\/279 \nin the North Annat Basin revealed rich warm water assemblages dominated by A. beccarii, \nBulimina marginata (cf. Haynes, 1973; Murray, 1985, 1991) and B. elongata (Table 3). In \nLoch Broom, the same species largely predominate in BGS cores 57-06\/269 and 57-06\/267, \nthough the frequency and diversity of species in the upper part of the unit is very variable. In \nthe outer loch, BGS core 57-06\/268, which sampled a mounded sediment drift (Fig. 9), \nrevealed only a sparse, poorly preserved, fauna including rare A. beccarii. In the inner loch, A. \nbeccarii is absent where sampled from the upper part of the unit in core 57-06\/267, whereas \nBGS core 57-06\/264 was totally barren of calcareous microfossils. Additional macrofaunal \nidentification includes intact bivalve shells of N. sulcata and G. humanus, recovered from \nSAMS core GC101 in the Tanera Basin.   \n \nThe geometry of the basinal deposits together with the evidence for both scouring and \nreworking at both the base and top (sea bed) of the Summer Isles Formation suggests that its \ndeposition has been strongly influenced by bottom current activity. In Loch Broom, \nespecially, this has resulted in lateral thickness changes with areas of low sedimentation \njuxtaposed against sites of preferential deposition (Fig. 9). This implies contemporary \nprocesses of erosion and deposition in the accumulation of the Summer Isles Formation. The \nlithological character of the mounded forms in Loch Broom is consistent with the muddy \ncontourite facies of Stow et al. (1996), whereas the basal facies has been compared to their \n\u2018infill drift\u2019 style (Stoker and Bradwell, 2009). The micro- and macrofauna from Loch Broom \nand the North Annat Basin indicate a temperate environment. However, the absence of \nmicrofauna in some samples may be indicative of the nature of the material that is being \nreworked.   \n \n4.2. Radiocarbon dating \n \nA total of six bivalve samples have been AMS 14C dated from the Assynt Glacigenic \nFormation, the Inner Loch Broom shell bed, and the Summer Isles Formation (Fig. 6; Table \n4). On the basis of the overall good state of preservation of the sample specimens, we regard \nthe chronology to be a reasonable indicator of the time of deposition. The only shell \n 19\n646 \n647 \n648 \n649 \n650 \n651 \n652 \n653 \n654 \n655 \n656 \n657 \n658 \n659 \n660 \n661 \n662 \n663 \n664 \n665 \n666 \n667 \n668 \n669 \n670 \n671 \n672 \n673 \n674 \n675 \n676 \n677 \n678 \n679 \ndisplaying slight peripheral abrasion was sampled from that part of the Inner Loch Broom \nshell bed that is overlain by the diamicton of the Rhiroy Member in BGS core 57-06\/267.  \n \nFrom these dates, we propose that the deposition of the Assynt Glacigenic Formation and its \nassociated members is correlated to the Lateglacial Interstadial (Greenland Interstadial-1). In \nthe Tanera Basin, SAMS core GC101 produced an age of 13,973\u00b173 years BP from the L. \nborealis valve, whereas an age of 14,111\u00b198 years BP was determined from A. islandica in \nBGS core 57-06\/279 in the North Annat Basin. In Loch Broom, an age of 13,047\u00b159 years \nBP was determined from C. islandica taken from the Inner Loch Broom shell bed in BGS \ncore 57-06\/267, beneath the Rhiroy Member of the Assynt Glacigenic Formation. On the \nbasis of these dates, we propose that glacially influenced sedimentation prevailed in the fjords \nof the Summer Isles region between c. 14 and 13 ka BP.  \n \nAn early Holocene date of 8,012\u00b153 years BP was obtained from A. islandica recovered from \na shell hash at the base of the Summer Isles Formation in BGS core 57-06\/267, immediately \noverlying the Rhiroy Member. This implies that the Rhiroy Member was deposited at some \ntime during the interval c. 13\u20138 ka BP. Further discussion of this age model is presented in \nsection 5.1. Dates of 7,670\u00b144 and 3,853\u00b172 years BP from N. sulcata and G. humanus, \nrespectively, in SAMS core GC101 confirm that the Summer Isles Formation represents \nHolocene post-glacial marine sedimentation in the fjords. \n \n5. Discussion  \n \nIt has been well established for many years that the Lateglacial interval (15\u201310 ka BP) in \nnorthern Britain was characterised by an inherently unstable climate \u2013 a flickering transition \nfrom glacial to interglacial conditions (e.g. Gray and Lowe, 1977; Lowe et al., 1999; Brooks \nand Birks, 2000). Changes in deglacial surface water circulation along the Hebridean \ncontinental margin (Kroon et al., 1997), together with palaeoclimatic data derived from fossil \nbeetle and midge assemblages in terrestrial sediments from Scotland, England and Wales \n(Mayle et al., 1999) reveal the following Lateglacial event stratigraphy for the British Isles: \n(a) a rapid warming ca 14.8 ka BP to a thermal maximum between 14.7\u201314.5 ka BP; (b) a \nsubsequent step-wise decline in temperature, punctuated by cool reversals at ca 14 and 13.5 \nka BP, terminating in (c) a  severe 1200-yr cold event \u2013 the Younger Dryas Stadial (GS-1). \nThis variation in climate shows remarkable compatibility with the Greenland ice-core data, \n 20\n680 \n681 \n682 \n683 \n684 \n685 \n686 \n687 \n688 \n689 \n690 \n691 \n692 \n693 \n694 \n695 \n696 \n697 \n698 \n699 \n700 \n701 \n702 \n703 \n704 \n705 \n706 \n707 \n708 \n709 \n710 \n711 \n712 \n713 \nwhich has been shown to be a robust record of environmental change throughout the North \nAtlantic region (Bj\u00f6rck et al., 1998; Lowe et al., 2008).  \n \nKey questions still remain concerning the extent of ice cover and the nature of glacier \nfluctuations in Scotland during this phase of climatic instability. Did glaciers in Scotland \ndisappear completely during the Lateglacial Interstadial?  Did glaciers grow anew from \ncorries and high-altitude sites in the Younger Dryas?  And how extensive and how responsive \nwere Scotland\u2019s glaciers at various times during the Lateglacial period (GS-1 vs GI-1). \nPreviously, this question has been largely addressed from a land-based perspective (Gray and \nLowe, 1977; Benn, 1997; Clapperton, 1997, Benn and Lukas, 2006; Golledge, 2008; and \nreferences therein). However, it is clear that any attempt to understand the deglacial record of \nthe British Ice Sheet must take both the marine and terrestrial records of change into \nconsideration. For example, Kroon et al. (1997) reported evidence for a phase of ice rafting \nalong the Hebridean margin during GI-1b (the Intra Aller\u00f8d Cold Period, IACP); whilst our \nstudy has revealed that a highly dynamic and glacially-influenced sedimentary regime \nprevailed in the fjords of the Summer Isles region during the Lateglacial Interstadial (from \nbefore 14 ka to ca 13 ka BP). It therefore seems implausible to invoke complete deglaciation \nof NW Scotland during the Lateglacial Interstadial. In Fig. 15, we present an event \nstratigraphy and glaciation curve for the Summer Isles region that combines the radiocarbon \ndates from this study, with other published radiometric and cosmogenic dates from this area. \nIn the following discussion, this framework provides the basis for assessing Lateglacial ice-\nsheet\/ice-cap dynamics in NW Scotland based on (1) age-constrained ice-margin \nreconstruction, and (2) style of sedimentation.    \n \n5.1. Age model and ice-margin reconstruction \n \nRegional evidence suggests that open arctic-water conditions prevailed in The Minch ca 16\u2013\n15 ka BP, with the ice-sheet margin located at or close to the present-day coastline (Peacock, \n1975; Graham et al., 1990; Stoker and Bradwell, 2005; Everest et al., 2006; Stone and \nBallantyne, 2006). In the Summer Isles region, we infer this position to correspond with the \n\u2018older\u2019 suite of moraines, the Rubha C\u00f2igeach\u2013Loch Ewe moraines (Figs. 4 and 16a), which, \nas yet, have not been correlated with moraines onshore. We propose that this line, from \noffshore Rubha Coigeach to the mouth of Loch Ewe, essentially forms the position of the ice \nsheet margin as it stabilised following the demise of the Minch palaeo-ice stream (Bradwell et \n 21\n714 \n715 \n716 \n717 \n718 \n719 \n720 \n721 \n722 \n723 \n724 \n725 \n726 \n727 \n728 \n729 \n730 \n731 \n732 \n733 \n734 \n735 \n736 \n737 \n738 \n739 \n740 \n741 \n742 \n743 \n744 \n745 \n746 \n747 \nal., 2007). The subsequent eastward retreat of the ice margin led to the development of fjordic \nand topographically controlled outlet glaciers in this part of NW Scotland. The proposed age \nmodel and ice-margin reconstructions (presented in Figs. 15 and 16) are based on a diverse set \nof new and previously published onshore and offshore data.  \n \nThe outer limit of the Assynt Glacigenic Formation \u2018younger\u2019 moraine suite is clearly \nsuperimposed on the \u2018older\u2019 Rubha C\u00f2igeach\u2013Loch Ewe moraine suite (Fig. 12), and \nrepresents a major readvance during ice-sheet deglaciation in NW Scotland. The timing and \nmagnitude of this initial retreat and subsequent readvance is still poorly constrained; however, \na combination of radiocarbon and cosmogenic dates suggests that this event occurred prior to \n14 ka BP (i.e. before GI-1d) (Bradwell et al., 2008; Ballantyne et al., 2009) (Fig. 15). A core \nrecovered from an isolation basin on Tanera M\u00f2r (Fig. 2) sampled tephra shards at 5.7 m \ndepth with Borrobol affinities (Roberts et al., 1998). The Borrobol tephra is dated elsewhere \nto ca 14.4 ka BP (Turney et al., 1997; Pyne-O\u2019Donnell, 2007); although the true stratigraphic \nnature of the Borrobol ash layer in Scotland is still debated, making its use as a definitive \nisochron uncertain (Pyne-O\u2019Donnell et al., 2008). In the adjacent Tanera and North Annat \nbasins, marine shells from proximal glaciomarine sediments have been dated to 13.9 ka and \n14.1 ka BP (this study) (Table 4). This is not inconsistent with cosmogenic exposure ages \nfrom boulders on moraines within the Assynt Glacigenic Formation at Achitibuie and near \nSail Mhor, which indicate that the series of recessional moraines extending landward from the \nSummer Isles (Fig. 4) were probably deposited during the first few centuries of the \nLateglacial Interstadial (Bradwell et al., 2008). A total of six 10Be exposure ages (Bradwell et \nal., 2008; Ballantyne et al., 2009) from the distinct and well-constrained Achiltibuie-Eilean \nDubh-Stattic Point limit (timeline a in Fig. 4) point to a minimum age of ca 13.5 ka BP for \nthis moraine, and an Older Dryas (GI-1d) age has been proposed for this oscillation (Bradwell \net al., 2008; and reasserted by Ballantyne et al., 2009). All of these data suggest that the \nSummer Isles region was only starting to become ice-free from ca 14.0 ka BP onwards. This \nis consistent with the infill stratigraphy of the fjord basins immediately landward of the \nSummer Isles bedrock sill, which contains no evidence for a major grounded readvance from \nwithin the fjord region out beyond the Rubha C\u00f2igeach headland. \n \nOn the basis of the chronological framework, it is tempting to speculate on the timing and \nformation mechanism of the delicate overprinted moraines offshore Rubha C\u00f2igeach. We \npropose that this regional ice-sheet position, represented by the outermost Assynt Glacigenic \n 22\n748 \n749 \n750 \n751 \n752 \n753 \n754 \n755 \n756 \n757 \n758 \n759 \n760 \n761 \n762 \n763 \n764 \n765 \n766 \n767 \n768 \n769 \n770 \n771 \n772 \n773 \n774 \n775 \n776 \n777 \n778 \n779 \n780 \n781 \nFormation moraine, was probably associated with the Lateglacial thermal maximum (GI-1e; \nca 14.5 ka BP) \u2013 possibly in response to internally-forced glaciological instability triggered by \na large-scale calving event.  Such a phenomenon would be expected when abrupt warming \ncauses the glacier terminus to thin, forcing the ice sheet margin to calve en masse and retreat \nto a point where its terminal thickness just exceeds the point of flotation (Van der Veen, 1996; \nBenn et al., 2007). Calving events of this kind have been reported from many contemporary \ntidewater glaciers in response to late 20th century warming (e.g. Cook et al., 2005; Joughin et \nal., 2008). Calving rates may also have been enhanced by tidal stress, for which high tidal \namplitudes and peak bed stress vectors have been predicted for the NW European shelf in the \nperiod from 15\u201311 ka BP (Uehara et al., 2006). Stabilisation of the ice-sheet margin, by \ngrounding in shallower water, deposited De Geer moraines. The delicate, well preserved, \ngeomorphological form and the discontinuous expression of these De Geer moraines around \nRubha C\u00f2igeach and offshore Greenstone Point indicate a near-buoyant or lightly grounded \nice margin (sensu Benn et al., 2007), consistent with terminus stabilization following a \nwidespread \u2018mass-reduction\u2019 or calving event. The absence of these moraines beyond this \npoint indicates that the ice sheet margin was probably floating immediately prior to this time, \nwhen relative sea levels were at least 30 m higher than present (Shennan et al., 2006).   \n \nThe identification of a particular moraine type (delicate De Geers), and style of marginal \ndynamics (grounding transition), and its likely association with a discrete climatic event (GI-\n1e; thermal maximum) opens the possibility of further constraining the age of the Summer \nIsles moraine sequence.  In the light of the collective evidence it seems most appropriate to \nplace the British Ice Sheet margin at the outermost Assynt Glacigenic Formation moraine \n(offshore Rubha C\u00f2igeach and Greenstone Point) at  ca 14.5 ka BP, immediately after the GI-\n1e \u2018thermal maximum\u2019 (Fig. 16b). Deglaciation in the following few centuries was of a lightly \ngrounded ice margin retreating to the south-east, occasionally pinning on the outermost \nbathymetric highs of the submerged part of the Summer Isles sill.  As relative sea levels \nbegan to fall, and the ice front encountered the main Tanera M\u00f2r-Eilean Dubh bathymetric \nhigh (Fig. 4), the marginal zone became more firmly grounded as the terminus pinned on the \ntopography of the islands (Fig. 16c). Ice sheet retreat would have slowed accordingly. This \nperiod probably coincided with the Older Dryas cold interval (GI-1d), already associated with \nthe dated Achiltibuie-Stattic Point moraine onshore (ca 14 ka BP; Bradwell et al., 2008; \nBallantyne et al; 2009) and recorded in the Greenland ice cores at 14.1\u201313.9 ka BP \n(Rasmussen et al., 2006; Lowe et al., 2008). Landward of this feature, the large closely spaced \n 23\n782 \n783 \n784 \n785 \n786 \n787 \n788 \n789 \n790 \n791 \n792 \n793 \n794 \n795 \n796 \n797 \n798 \n799 \n800 \n801 \n802 \n803 \n804 \n805 \n806 \n807 \n808 \n809 \n810 \n811 \n812 \n813 \n814 \n815 \nseabed moraines from Eilean Dubh to Martin Bank probably represent firmly grounded \noscillations and stillstands punctuating overall ice-front retreat during GI-1c (13.9\u201313.3 ka \nBP) (Fig. 16d). We propose from this sequence of events that the Summer Isles ice lobe had \nretreated back to the vicinity of Ullapool by ca 13.5\u201313.3 ka BP. \n \nThe Inner Loch Broom shell bed has been dated at 13,047\u00b153 years BP, and suggests that \nLittle Loch Broom and two-thirds of Loch Broom were ice free by this time. However, the \nglacigenic Rhiroy Member diamicton (within the Assynt Glacigenic Formation) overlies this \nshell bed in inner Loch Broom (Fig. 6). We interpret this to represent just one of a number of \nlocal readvances of ice back into the fjord in the vicinity of Ullapool (Figs. 15 and 16e). The \nAllt na h-Airbhe Member represents an initial readvance offshore Ullapool; the ice-contact \nlandform assemblage associated with this member was subsequently overstepped by the fan-\ndelta highstand deposits of the Ullapool Gravel Formation (Fig. 13). The latter was probably \ndeposited when relative sea level in this area was about +15 m OD (Sissons and Dawson, \n1981; Shennan et al., 2006). The Allt an t-Srathain Member onshore overlies, reworks and in \nplaces oversteps the Ullapool Gravel Formation, suggesting that this glacial readvance is \nequivalent to, or just postdates, the +15-m sea level highstand. In Loch Broom, the gravel-rich \nupper section of the Outer Loch Broom shell bed (Fig. 6) may represent ice-rafted dropstones \ndeposited in association with one or both of these readvances. Collectively, this evidence \nconstrains the age of the youngest offshore readvance, the Rhiroy Member, to the latest \nInterstadial\u2013Younger Dryas (GI-1\u2013GS-1) interval. As the presently accepted Younger Dryas \nice limits in this part of NW Scotland are restricted to the mountain valleys and corries to the \nsouth and east of the study area (Sissons, 1977; Bennet and Boulton, 1993; Finlayson and \nBradwell, 2007) (Fig. 16f), it seems reasonable to assume that the Allt na h-Airbhe, Allt an t-\nSrathain, and Rhiroy glacigenic members all represent time-transgressive pre-cursors to the \nYounger Dryas readvance (during GI-1a). Alternatively, and more controversially, the Rhiroy \nMember may represent renewed ice cap growth during the initial phase of the Younger Dryas \nchronozone (13.0\u201312.5 ka BP). This interpretation leaves the status of the Younger Dryas \nreadvance in NW Scotland uncertain.  \n \nPerhaps the most significant aspect of our age model is that none of the various dating \nmethods (analytical, seismostratigraphic or geomorphic) are contradictory. Collectively, they \ndescribe punctuated recession of a dynamically evolving ice margin throughout the \nLateglacial Interstadial. Thus, we propose that the Summer Isles region experienced \n 24\n816 \n817 \n818 \n819 \n820 \n821 \n822 \n823 \n824 \n825 \n826 \n827 \n828 \n829 \n830 \n831 \n832 \n833 \n834 \n835 \n836 \n837 \n838 \n839 \n840 \n841 \n842 \n843 \n844 \n845 \n846 \n847 \n848 \ndeglaciation from ca 15 to 13 ka BP, interrupted by numerous readvances and ice-front \noscillations of varying magnitude. Projecting backwards along a palaeo-ice-sheet flow line \n(Fig. 15), we suggest that Tanera M\u00f2r was ice free just before ca 14.2 ka BP; Isle Martin was \nice free by ca 13.7 BP; Ullapool and Corry Point were probably ice free by ca 13.5 ka BP; and \ninner Loch Broom soon after. This represents an average ice-margin retreat rate of 20 m a-1 \nover 1500 years (based on Tanera M\u00f2r to Corry Point), if the numerous ice-marginal \noscillations are discounted. Glaciers re-advanced into Loch Broom for the final time, as far as \nRhiroy, some time after 13 ka BP.  In further support of this model, our faunal data, recovered \nfrom several fjord cores, indicate fluctuating climatic conditions with mixed assemblages of \nboreo-arctic and temperate species. Such mixing is not unexpected when one considers the \ndeglacial surface circulation record from the Hebrides margin, where rapid oscillations in sea-\nsurface temperature and salinity attest to the frequent displacement of cool polar water by \nrelatively warm saline water throughout the Lateglacial Interstadial and into the Younger \nDryas interval (Kroon et al., 1997). The evidence of ice-rafting at this latitude during the \nIACP (Kroon et al., 1997) might also be expected if, as our study suggests, tidewater glaciers \npersisted in NW Scottish fjords into the latter half of the Lateglacial Interstadial (GI-1c\u2013a).   \n \n5.2. Style of sedimentation   \n \nSyvitski et al. (1987) recognise five stages of fjord infilling: (1) glacier-filled; (2) retreating \ntidewater glaciers; (3) hinterland glaciers that still contribute meltwater and sediment to the \nfjord; (4) completely deglaciated, with fjord sedimentation responding to normal marine and \nparaglacial processes; and, (5) fjords completely infilled and isolated from the sea. The fjords \nof the Summer Isles\u2013Wester Ross region are currently in stage 4 of the infill process, and \nmost likely have been since the early Holocene onset of deposition of the Summer Isles \nFormation. The basinal sediments that comprise this unit were deposited by normal marine \nprocesses strongly influenced by bottom currents, with only minor input of gravity-driven \ndeposits. However, most of the sediment accumulation within the fjord basins relates to stages \n1\u20133 when glacial and glacimarine sediment processes were active during and after the last \nmajor ice advance. In the following discussion, the distinction between proximal and distal \nglacimarine zones is based on Powell (1984), who defined the ice-proximal zone as up to 5 \nkm from the tidewater ice margin, with the ice distal zone (~10s of km) beyond.    \n \n 25\n849 \n850 \n851 \n852 \n853 \n854 \n855 \n856 \n857 \n858 \n859 \n860 \n861 \n862 \n863 \n864 \n865 \n866 \n867 \n868 \n869 \n870 \n871 \n872 \n873 \n874 \n875 \n876 \n877 \n878 \n879 \n880 \n881 \n882 \nLodgement till of the Loch Broom Till Formation was deposited at the base of the glacier-\nfilled fjords when the Summer Isles region acted as a tributary of the Minch palaeo-ice stream \nduring the Main Late Devensian Stadial (Greenland Stadial 2: GS-2). In The Minch, an \nequivalent till deposit was formed in the upper part of the Fiona sequence. Following the \ncollapse of the ice stream, the recessional Rubha C\u00f2igeach\u2013Loch Ewe moraine suite \ndeveloped as the ice margin stabilised at or near to the present-day coastline at ca. 16\u2013 15 ka \nBP (Figs. 4, 15 and 16a). These are just part of a series of offshore moraines that have \npreviously been identified in The Minch (cf. Bishop and Jones, 1979; Chesher et al., 1983; \nFyfe et al., 1993), and which we now associate with the retreating ice sheet margin. The \nmoraines that comprise the Rubha C\u00f2igeach\u2013Loch Ewe suite are large; offshore Rubha \nC\u00f2igeach they range from 50\u2013250 m wide and 5\u201325 m high (Fig. 12), whereas the Loch Ewe \nmoraine is up to 2 km wide (Fig. 4) and 20\u201330 m high (Stoker et al., 2006). The scale of the \nlatter moraine, in particular, suggests that the pre-Interstadial ice-sheet margin in this region \n(Fig. 15a) may have been quasi-stable for a substantial period of time \u2013 probably pinned by \nthe broad bedrock sill connecting Rubha C\u00f2igeach and Greenstone Point (Fig. 4).   \n \nFollowing the phase of ice-sheet oscillations during GI-1e and 1d (Fig. 16b and c), the ice \nmargin would have undergone a change in frontal morphology and hypsometry; evolving \nfrom a coherent linear \u2018ice-sheet\u2019 margin into separate lobes of topographically controlled \nfjord glaciers. Large tidewater-glacier termini would have co-existed in Loch Broom, Little \nLoch Broom, Gruinard Bay and Loch Ewe. The timeline (a in Fig. 4) afforded by the coherent \nseabed moraine ridge between Achiltibuie and Stattic Point, (Fig. 3), implies that the South \nPriest Basin was the first of the fjord basins to become exposed (Bradwell et al., 2008). The \nsequential pattern of moraine ridges on Martin Bank indicates that the Skerries, Tanera and \nouter Little Loch Broom basins were next to become open, followed by the Coigach, Annat, \nand inner Little Loch Broom basins (b and c in Fig. 4). Episodic oscillations of the grounded \nice margin on Martin Bank is demonstrated by individual moraines displaying intricate, \noccasionally bifurcating, morphologies \u2013 a function of having been pushed forward by up to \nseveral hundred metres (Bradwell et al., 2008).  \n \nThe main deglacial stratigraphic units are the Assynt Glacigenic and Annat Bay formations, \nwhose relationships are regarded as time-transgressive (Figs. 5 and 14). The Assynt \nGlacigenic Formation forms an extensive onshore-to-offshore deposit composed of ice-\ncontact and proximal glacimarine facies (Fig. 4). On land and on the shallow marine banks, \n 26\n883 \n884 \n885 \n886 \n887 \n888 \n889 \n890 \n891 \n892 \n893 \n894 \n895 \n896 \n897 \n898 \n899 \n900 \n901 \n902 \n903 \n904 \n905 \n906 \n907 \n908 \n909 \n910 \n911 \n912 \n913 \n914 \n915 \n916 \ndiamicton is associated with the moraine ridges, whereas proximal glacimarine dropstone \nclay\/silty clay accumulated between the ridges on the banks, and more predominantly in the \nadjacent basins (Fig. 8). However, the variable seismic-stratigraphic style of the basinal \nproglacial sediments (Figs. 7\u201310) is indicative of fluctuating energy conditions and changing \nsedimentary processes as the ice margin retreated, most likely ranging from low-energy \nsuspension sedimentation (draped configuration) to higher-energy turbidite and sediment \ngravity flow deposition (ponded, chaotic) (Syvitski, 1989). Due to the limited penetration of \nthe cores, not all of the seismic facies within the Assynt Glacigenic Formation have been \ntested.  \n \nAs individual basins became increasingly distant from the grounding line(s), distal \nglacimarine sediments of the Annat Bay Formation accumulated in all of the basins outside \nLoch Broom, and in the inner part of Little Loch Broom (Fig. 4). The asymmetric geometry \nof this unit is a characteristic of sediment plume-derived material that has been deflected to \nthe side of the fjord basin by the Coriolis force (Syvitski, 1989). In the Skerries Basin (Fig. \n7b), the sediment plume was derived from an ice margin to the east; thus the plume would be \nclassically deflected to the northern side of the basin (i.e. to the right in the northern \nhemisphere). In contrast, the pattern in the South Priest Basin is more complex, as the basin \nhas potential entry points from the north, east and south, which would result in an \nanticlockwise gyre (right-hand deflection at all entry points) with sediment accumulating on \nboth the southern and northern flanks (Figs. 3 and 7a). The depositional geometry may also \nhave been enhanced by the changing hydrodynamic conditions, for which a strong palaeotidal \nregime is predicted during this interval (Uehara et al., 2006). The reason for the absence of the \nAnnat Bay Formation in outer Little Loch Broom is unknown, though it may be that the \nshallow depth of the mid loch sill (currently 25 m water depth) coupled with the greater depth \nof the inner loch (Fig. 10) combined to act as an effective sediment trap for any material \nderived from the adjacent hinterland or the head of the loch (Fig. 4). Its total absence from \nLoch Broom is tentatively attributed to the predominance of this basin as an ice-contact\u2013ice-\nproximal depocentre. Loch Broom contains the thickest accumulation (up to 100 m) of the \nAssynt Glacigenic Formation, which may reflect multiple tidewater grounding lines from \nadjacent valleys, such as Allt an t-Srathain, Glen Achall and numerous side valleys towards \nthe head of the loch. On this basis, it is probable that Loch Broom acted more as a source of \nsediment plumes that fed the basins outside of the loch. Unlike Little Loch Broom, there is an \nopen connection to the outside basins via the South and South East Annat basins (Fig. 3). The \n 27\n917 \n918 \n919 \n920 \n921 \n922 \n923 \n924 \n925 \n926 \n927 \n928 \n929 \n930 \n931 \n932 \n933 \n934 \n935 \n936 \n937 \n938 \n939 \n940 \n941 \n942 \n943 \n944 \n945 \n946 \n947 \n948 \n949 \n950 \nNorth Annat and Coigach basins were probably fed by grounding line sediment plumes \nderived from a tidewater glacier in Loch Kanaird.  \n \nLocal complexity to this general pattern of sedimentation includes the effects of mass failure \nthroughout the Summer Isles region. Large-scale mass failures, such as the Cadail Slide in the \nNorth Annat Basin (Fig. 8), and the Little Loch Broom Slide Complex (Stoker et al., in press) \n(Fig. 10), have disrupted and displaced the deposits of the Assynt Glacigenic Formation. This \nunit has also been deformed in outer Loch Broom, where the basin-floor deposits have \nundergone slumping and folding (Stoker and Bradwell, 2009). The Cadail Slide pre-dates \ndeposition of the Annat Bay Formation, whereas the deformation in Loch Broom occurred \nprior to deposition of the Outer Loch Broom shell bed, dated (by correlation with the Inner \nLoch Broom shell bed) as no younger than about 13 ka BP. By association, the Little Loch \nBroom Slide Complex has been assigned a similar age. Paraglacial landscape readjustment \nand earthquake-shock, induced by glacial unloading, have been inferred as potential triggers \nof mass failure (Stoker and Bradwell, 2009; Stoker et al., in press). The late-stage debris flow \ndeposits, which post-date the Annat Bay Formation, but are pre-Holocene, are further \nindicators of Lateglacial slope instability. \n \nThe sediment accumulation rate in the Summer Isles fjord basins ranges from 50\u2013100 mm a-1 \n(based on combined thickness of Assynt Glacigenic and Annat Bay formations (50\u2013100 m) as \nmeasured from the seismic profiles, divided by the total period of deposition (~ 1,000 yr), and \naveraged across an entire basin). This is consistent with the >10 mm a-1 accumulation rate that \nSyvitski and Shaw (1995) use to classify fjords with a high sediment-accumulation rate. \nHowever, these high rates of accumulation are likely to be minimum estimates when one \nconsiders that most sediment within an ice-contact\/ice-proximal basin accumulates very \nrapidly at the contemporary grounding line (Powell, 1991). In the temperate glacial fjords of \nsoutheastern Alaska, modern-day sediment accumulation rates up to 13,000 mm a-1 have been \nmeasured within 300 m of the glacier terminus (Cowan and Powell, 1991).  \n \nThe fjord basins essentially became starved of sediment once the glaciers had reached the \nhinterland. Even prior to the late-stage glacier oscillation in Loch Broom, the accumulation of \nthe Inner and Outer Loch Broom shell beds indicates that siliciclastic input was primarily \nlinked to availability from the glacier front. The fan-deltas associated with the Ullapool \nGravel Formation represent the last main glacially-related input to the basin, though this was \n 28\n951 \n952 \n953 \n954 \n955 \n956 \n957 \n958 \n959 \n960 \n961 \n962 \n963 \n964 \n965 \n966 \n968 \n969 \n970 \n972 \n973 \n974 \n975 \n976 \n977 \n978 \n980 \n981 \n982 \n983 \nlargely restricted to the periphery of the fjord. As the ice cap area gradually reduced, the \namount of sediment feeding the offshore basins declined markedly; hence the accumulation of \nthe shell beds. Excluding the late-stage Loch Broom (Rhiroy) oscillation, sedimentation in the \nfjord basins between about 13 and 8 ka BP, including the Younger Dryas, was negligible, and \nonly resumed in the early Holocene with the deposition of the Summer Isles Formation. The \ngeometry of this unit was influenced by bottom-currents: an initially vigorous flow, \nrepresented by coarse basal facies in Loch Broom (ca 8 ka BP) and probably also the large-\nscale gravel waves that rework the top of the Newton-Loggie fan delta, stabilised and reduced \nin energy from about 7.5 ka BP (Tanera Basin). Subsequent deposition of finer-grained, \ncommonly mounded, sediments became predominant. Whilst this is indicative of an active \nHolocene tidal current regime, comparable with other Scottish fjords such as Loch Etive \n(N\u00f8rgaard-Pedersen et al., 2006), the decline in tidal stress during the Holocene is consistent \nwith predicted models of tidal evolution on the NW European shelf (Uehara et a., 2006).           \n \n 6. Conclusions \n \n\u2022 On the basis of swath bathymetry, high-resolution seismic profiles, offshore cores and 967 \nonshore exposures we have established an onshore\u2013offshore lithostratigraphic scheme for \nLateglacial\u2013Holocene deglaciation and sedimentation in the Summer Isles region of NW \nScotland.  \n\u2022 The fjord succession consists of five main lithostratigraphic formations: 1) Loch Broom 971 \nTill Formation (oldest); 2) Assynt Glacigenic Formation; 3) Annat Bay Formation; 4) \nUllapool Gravel Formation; and, 5) Summer Isles Formation. The Assynt Glacigenic \nFormation is further divided, locally, into four members: the Allt na h-Airbhe, Allt an t-\nSrathain and Rhiroy Members in Loch Broom, and the Rireavach Member in Little Loch \nBroom. The \u2018Late-stage debris flows\u2019 and \u2018Inner and Outer Loch Broom shell beds\u2019 are \nidentified as lithogenetic units \u2013 locally mappable, but not easily correlated to specific \nformations. \n\u2022 Whereas the Loch Broom Till Formation is a subglacial lodgement till linked to the Minch 979 \nice-stream succession, the remaining units preserve a record of subsequent deglaciation. \nThe Assynt Glacigenic Formation is the most widespread unit and consists of time-\ntransgressive ice-contact and ice-proximal glacimarine and terrestrial glacigenic facies \ndeposited across the whole region \u2013 including headlands, valleys, shallow marine banks \n 29\n984 \n985 \n986 \n987 \n988 \n989 \n990 \n991 \n992 \n993 \n995 \n996 \n997 \n998 \n1000 \n1001 \n1002 \n1004 \n1005 \n1007 \n1008 \n1009 \n1010 \n1011 \n1012 \n1013 \n1014 \n1015 \n1016 \nand the deep floors of the fjord basins. A suite of over 50 seafloor moraine ridges, traced \nfrom Rubha C\u00f2igeach\u2013Greenstone Point into the inner parts of Loch Broom and Little \nLoch Broom, chart oscillatory retreat of the British Ice Sheet from a buoyant calving \nmargin in The Minch to topographically confined ice-cap outlet glaciers in the fjords. The \nAnnat Bay Formation consists of ice-distal glacimarine deposits, laid down diachronous \nwith the Assynt Glacigenic Formation. The Allt na h-Airbhe, Allt an t-Srathain and \nRhiroy Members of the Assynt Glacigenic Formation represent late-stage readvances of \nglaciers into Loch Broom; their association with the fan-delta deposits of the Ullapool \nGravel Formation marks the oscillatory retreat of outlet glaciers from the fjords. The \nSummer Isles Formation is an exclusively Holocene marine unit.  \n\u2022 Macro- and micropalaeontological indicators reveal fluctuating climatic conditions during 994 \nthe deposition of the Assynt Glacigenic and Annat Bay formations, as well as the Inner \nand Outer Loch Broom shell beds, with mixed assemblages of boreo-arctic and temperate \nspecies recovered in cores from the fjord. The faunal mixing indicates that glacially-\ninfluenced marine sediments were deposited in a cold but not fully Arctic environment. \n\u2022 Radiocarbon AMS dating of bivalve shells from the fjord sediments indicates that the 999 \nSummer Isles region became ice free between ca 14 and 13 ka BP (i.e. within Greenland \nInterstadial 1). This is consistent with previous onshore cosmogenic dates, and is further \nsupported by our palaeoenvironmental data from basinal deposits.  \n\u2022 Ice-margin reconstruction suggests an average ice-margin retreat rate of ~20 m a-1. 1003 \nSediment thicknesses within the Summer Isles fjords indicate a high sediment \naccumulation rate, with a minimum estimate ranging from 50\u2013100 mm a-1.   \n\u2022 We find increasingly strong evidence for ice survival in NW Scotland during the 1006 \nLateglacial Interstadial (GI-1), with the stepwise retreat of the ice sheet punctuated by \nnumerous readvances of varying magnitudes. This work confirms that glaciers in this part \nof northern Scotland were considerably larger in the Older Dryas period than during the \nsubsequent Younger Dryas Stadial. Furthermore, our data also suggest that glaciers re-\nadvanced into inner Loch Broom some time after 13 ka BP \u2013 calling into question the \naccepted limits of Younger Dryas Stadial (GS-1) glaciation in NW Scotland. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank the masters and crew of the R\/V Calanus and R\/V James Cook for \ntheir skill and assistance during the collection of the geophysical and geological datasets. \n 30\n1017 \n1018 \n1019 \n1020 \n1021 \nAlan Stevenson and Martin Smith are thanked for their continuing support of the project, and \nfor their comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

Schematic reconstructions of Lateglacial ice-sheet retreat in NW Scotland. Timeslices 1351 \nshow ice extent at various intervals during the period from >15 ka to 12.5 ka BP. Note: ice \nthickness uncertain, therefore nunataks not shown. (a) End GS-2: Ice sheet grounded west \nof Rubha C\u00f2igeach and Rubha Mor headlands. (No onshore moraine equivalents \nidentified.) (b) GI-1e: Ice sheet calving back to stable grounded position offshore Rubha \nC\u00f2igeach and Rubha Mor following thermal maximum (ca 14 .5 ka BP). Gairloch \n(\u2018Wester Ross Readvance\u2019) moraine probably represents onshore equivalent. (c) GI-1d: \nLobate ice margin stationary at Achiltibuie-Stattic Point Moraine. Onshore moraines \naround Loch Lurgainn and at Aultbea are likely age-equivalents. (d) GI-1c: Ice cap outlet \nglaciers terminating at the present-day coastline in Loch Kanaird and Little Loch Broom.  \nLoch Broom still occupied by glaciers. (e) GI-1a: Period of outlet glacier oscillations in \nthe vicinity of Ullapool (ca 13.5 ka BP) followed by ice-free, open marine, conditions in \ninner Loch Broom (ca 13 ka BP). Surrounding feeder valleys may also have been largely \nice-free at this time; mountain ice fields still exist. Final late-stage readvance back into \nLoch Broom (early Younger Dryas?). (f) GS-1: Restricted (but reinvigorated?) ice cap and \ncirque glaciation in periphery of study area (Fisherfield, Beinn Dearg, Assynt and isolated \nmountains) during mid-to-late Younger Dryas Stadial.

Locally \nsubdivided in Loch Broom into thin, discontinuous, basal \nunit overlain by main part of sequence. Not seismically \nresolved in outer Little Loch Broom. Lag deposit (<1 m \nthick) common on shallow banks and sills.  \nDominated by a weak, parallel-laminated, reflection \nconfiguration that onlaps the basin margins; \ndownlapping reflectors associated with mounded drifts \nand erosional moats. In Loch Broom, chaotic to weakly \nlayered basal unit is locally downlapped by overlying \nmounded deposit. Lag deposit not recognised \nseismically, though small-scale ripples locally \nobserved on shallow banks and sills. \nGrey, olive grey and greenish grey, homogeneous, soft to very soft, silty \nclay with sporadic shells, wood fragments, rare slumped bedding (Little \nLoch Broom), and smell of gas. In Loch Broom, silty clay overlies a \ncoarser-grained basal unit that includes a coarse, clean, moderately \nsorted, granule-grade, shell hash. Silty clay coarsens upward to silt in \nNorth Annat Basin. Sandy veneer at sea bed in outer Loch Broom. Lag of \ngravelly shelly muddy sand , common on shallow banks and sills. \nUllapool \nGravel \nFormation \nComposed of a series of spreads, benches, terraces and \nlow-angle fan-deltas around the margins of Loch Broom, \nLoch Kanaird and Little Loch Broom. The Ullapool Fan \nis largest deposit: 45 m thick and 2 km2 in area.   \nSubmerged part of fans display large-scale (to 20 m) \noblique-parallel sets of prograding clinoforms (up to \n10\u00ba), consistent with foreset cross-bedding observed \nonshore, e.g. Ullapool, Newton Loggie fans.  \nClast-supported, crudely bedded, cobble gravel with sporadic intercalated \nsand beds. Clasts mainly subrounded to rounded and commonly \nimbricated. Normal grading in finer-grade gravel units. Large-scale \nplanar cross beds and foresets observed locally. \nInner and \nOuter Loch \nBroom shell \nbeds1 \nProven only in Loch Broom, this deposit is <1 m thick. It \noverlies the bioturbated top of the Assynt Glacigenic Fm \nbasin infill, but is overlain by the Rhiroy Mb (Assynt \nGlacigenic Fm) in inner Loch Broom. \nNot seismically resolvable.  Very poorly sorted mix of whole and fragmented bivalve shells set in a \nvariably sandy and muddy matrix, with sporadic gravel clasts, to 4.5 cm. \nDivisible into three subunits or subfacies: 1) basal shelly mud\/sand, \n0.13\u20130.19 m thick; 2) dense, middle shell hash, 0.3\u20130.36 m thick; 3) \nupper \u2013 varies from gravel-rich to crudely bedded, shelly mud, 0.15\u20130.19 \nm thick. Bivalve assemblage dominated by Chlamys islandica. \nLate-stage \ndebris flow \ndeposits1 \nDiscrete basin-floor wedges, up to 8\u20139 m thick, on flanks \nof Coigach, S and SE Annat basins, and outer Loch \nBroom, and at foot of mid-loch sill in inner Little Loch \nBroom.  \nAcoustically chaotic internal reflection configuration, \nwith irregular (commonly rough) upper surface and \nvariably planar to irregular (erosional?) basal surface. \nSoft, massive, grey, pebbly mud  in outer Loch Broom; folded interbeds \nof olive grey clay and greyish brown sandy silt with muddy sand \nintraclasts in inner Little Loch Broom. \nAnnat Bay \nFormation \nRestricted to basins outside Loch Broom, as well as inner \nLittle Loch Broom. Commonly displays an asymmetric \n(Coriolis effect) infill style, 10\u201325 m thick.  \nMainly acoustically layered, with variable weak-to-\nstrong, parallel, onlapping reflection configuration, \nalbeit locally obscured by gas blanking.  \nDark grey\u2013dark greenish grey, poorly sorted, homogenous, soft, silty clay \nwith sporadic bivalve fragments, rare gastropod (Turritella sp.) shells, \nand rare thin sand beds with abundant carbonate.  \nAssynt \nGlacigenic \nFormation, \nincluding Allt \nna h-Airbhe, \nAllt an t-\nSrathain, \nRhiroy and \nRireavach \nmembers \nDiscontinuous onshore veneer (locally up to 5 m) that \nthickens offshore as an extensive moraine-moulded sheet \ndrape up to 20 m thick on shallow banks, which passes \ntransitionally into a 20\u201360-m (locally 100 m) thick infill \nin the adjacent basins. Allt na h-Airbhe, Allt an t-Srathain \nand Rhiroy members: sheet-like units, up to 7 m thick, \nrestricted to coastal and offshore areas of Loch Broom. \nRireavach Member: a mass flow complex up to 12 m \nthick in outer Little Loch Broom. \nAcoustically structureless to chaotic morainal sheet \ndrape contrasts with layered basin fill that displays a \nvariable draped, onlapping and ponded reflection \npattern. Basinal reflections commonly disrupted by \ncontemporary slumping, sliding, faulting and folding. \nAllt na h-Airbhe and Rhiroy members: mainly chaotic, \ndiscontinuous, internal reflections. Allt an t-Srathain \nmember: displays internal deformation fabric. \nRireavach Member: mainly chaotic or structureless, \nthough sporadic, discontinuous, reflections reveal a \nshingled pattern.  \nPoor to well-consolidated, grey to red-brown, silty\u2013sandy diamicton , to \nboulder grade, clast-to-matrix supported, mainly massive, local gravel \nand sand interbeds. Homogenous, soft to firm, grey to olive grey and \nbrown\u2013grey, massive to colour banded, slightly sandy silt and silty clay \nwith sporadic pebbles (to 10 cm), shell fragments and rare whole shells \nlocally overlies diamicton on shallow banks, and predominates in the \nbasins. Subordinate thin- to thick-bedded, brown, reddish grey and olive \ngrey, very fine to medium-grained quartzose sands recovered in Loch \nBroom and Little Loch Broom. Allt na h-Airbhe, Allt an t-Srathain and \nRhiroy members: muddy, matrix-supported, deformed diamicton, clasts \nto 10 cm, locally shelly. Rireavach Member: variable lithofacies, \nincluding gravelly sandy debris-flow, and muddy slump deposits. \nLoch Broom \nTill Formation \nDiscontinuous sheet-like unit, both onshore and offshore. \nUp to 20 m thick on Martin Bank; well developed also in \nGruinard Bay and off Cailleach Head where onshore \nstreamlined form continues offshore.  \nDiscontinuous, sub-parallel to wavy internal reflections \nobserved on Martin Bank; homogenous to chaotic \ncharacter in Gruinard Bay. Not easily distinguished \nfrom bedrock over much of offshore region. \nGrey to red, overconsolidated, muddy and sandy diamicton , gravel to \nboulder grade, matrix to clast supported, with a strong subhorizontal clast \nfabric observed onshore and in Gruinard Bay. \n \n 1Lithogenetic units, unassigned \n \nTable 1.
