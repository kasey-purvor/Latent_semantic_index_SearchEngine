In recent years many voluntary sector organisations have\nexperienced a changing context, where they have become increasingly involved in contracting for\nthe provision of publically funded services. This paper examines the suggestion made by a\nnumber of commentators that as a result the government has exercised influence over the way in\nwhich human resources are managed in this sector.\nDesign\/methodology\/approach: The paper uses data from the Workplace Employment Relations\nSurvey 2004 (WERS 2004) to examine HRM practice in the voluntary sector and compares this\nwith the public and private sectors.\nFindings: The findings show that most voluntary sector organisations have adopted performance\noriented HR practices, communication and involvement schemes, and welfare-oriented practices.\nThis suggests a departure from the relatively unsophisticated HRM that has traditionally been\nfound in the voluntary sector and which may be as a result of the influence of government on\nHRM standards in the sector.\nResearch limitations: Future research which adopts a longitudinal approach would allow the\nimpact of government influence on HRM practices in the voluntary sector to be examined in more\ndepth.\nOriginality\/value: This paper represents a rare examination of HRM practice across a wide range\nof voluntary sector organisations and provides insight into the potential influence of government\non HRM in the sector.\nKeywords\nVoluntary sector Human Resource Management Government influence\n2Background\nThe management of human resources is central to the voluntary sector, not only because labour\ncosts represent a significant proportion of total costs (Passey et al., 2000), but also because the\nstaff play an important role in delivering the organisation\u2019s mission (Kendall, 2003; Ridder and\nMcCandless, 2010). A number of authors have identified a characteristic approach to management\nin the voluntary sector and this has influenced the way in which people are managed (Armstrong,\n1992; Billis, 1993; Lloyd, 1993). This distinctive approach has been attributed to the specific\ncontext in which the voluntary sector operates (Armstrong, 1992). First, voluntary sector\norganisations are likely to have a strong value orientation linked to the organisation\u2019s mission,\nwhich will inform the approach to managing people (Ridder and McCandless, 2010). Second,\nmanagers in this sector are often accountable to a number of different stakeholders with\npotentially conflicting interests (Armstrong, 1992). Third, people attracted to work for voluntary\nsector organisations frequently have a commitment to the mission (Ban et al., 2003). Cunningham\n(2010: 701) uses the term \u2018voluntary sector ethos\u2019 to describe how employees often commit to an\norganisation, in order to be able to serve a social cause or mission and argues that the employment\nrelationship is therefore characterised by a \u2018high level of mutuality between management and\nlabour\u2019 (p. 699). In practical terms this may mean that employees are less concerned with\nextrinsic rewards because they also seek intrinsic ones, which may allow employers to utilise what\nLloyd (1993) terms the \u2018ethos discount\u2019, offering inferior (to market) terms and conditions of\nemployment. Finally, many voluntary sector organisations typically experience an irregular and\nunpredictable stream of funding (Armstrong, 1992).\nIn recent years several commentators have observed that approaches to the management of\nhuman resources in the voluntary sector have changed (Kellock Hay et al., 2001; Parry et al.,\n2005; Parry and Kelliher, 2009; Rodwell and Teo, 2004). Many explanations for these changes\nstem from the increased role of the voluntary sector in contracting for the provision of publicly\nfunded services. For example, Passey et al. (2000) have argued that the development of a \u2018contract\nclimate\u2019 has placed greater cost pressures on employers and has limited their ability to develop\nlong term relationships with employees. Parry and Kelliher (2009) found approaches to\nrecruitment and retention changed in response to the labour shortages brought about by the\nsignificant expansion in the provision of drug and alcohol treatment services. Cunningham (2010)\nsuggests that that the increasing involvement of the voluntary sector in the delivery of publically\nfunded services may have implications for the nature of the employment relationship in two ways.\nFirst, that the sense of mission may be compromised when these organisations become dependent\non state funding. Second, that the principles of New Public Management (NPM) may impact\n3employee loyalty if they serve to undermine pay and conditions for employees. These changes\nmay not have occurred as a result of deliberate government strategies to shape HRM in the\nvoluntary sector, rather they may be an unintended consequence of greater government\ninvolvement in funding voluntary services through contracting out and the service delivery\nstandards contained within contracted these relationships. However, a number of commentators\nhave argued that government may exercise direct influence over the way in which employees are\nmanaged, by using its power as a purchaser to require contracting organisations to adhere to\ncertain standards (Alatrista and Arrowsmith, 2004; Cunningham, 2008, 2010; Parry and Kelliher,\nforthcoming). This may be in part an attempt to propagate \u2018best practice\u2019 via government\nsponsored initiatives such as Investors in People (Paton and Foot, 2000), but may also be driven\nby a concern to ensure that government funding is spent effectively (Parry and Kelliher, 2009).\nMuch of the extant evidence in relation to these changes has been specific to particular\npublically funded services (Parry et al., 2005 substance misuse treatment services; Baines, 2004;\nCunningham, 2008 social services). Consequently, from this evidence it is hard to generalise and\nit may be that certain parts of the voluntary sector have been subject to greater direct or indirect\nintervention by government than others. In an attempt to take a broader look at the voluntary\nsector, in this article we examine the 2004 Workplace Employment Relations Survey (WERS)\ndata. This allows us first, to examine practices across a broader spectrum of the voluntary sector\nand therefore make a more general assessment, and second, to make direct comparisons between\nthe voluntary, public and private sectors. The WERS 2004 was the first time in the series that data\nfrom the voluntary sector was recorded separately from other sectors, therefore it is not possible to\nassess change by comparison with earlier datasets. In the light of this constraint, we assess change\nin two ways. First, we will explore whether these findings differ from the characteristic\napproaches to managing HR reported in the literature. Second, we will compare the findings on\nthe voluntary sector with those of the public and private sectors. We argue that if government has\nexercised direct influence over the sector, we are likely to see some similarity with the approach\nadopted in the public sector and possibly the private sector. The private sector is commonly\nthought of as the source of pro-market public sector management models such as New Public\nManagement (Baines, 2004; Cunningham, 2008) and hence is a useful comparator to the public\nand voluntary sectors.\nThe public sector itself has undergone significant change in recent years, driven by the\nNPM agenda (Pollitt & Bouckaert, 2004) seeking to cut costs and increase efficiency by\nintroducing: competition in service provision; private sector style management; and more explicit\nmeasurement of performance (Baines, 2010; Hood, 1991). This has resulted in increasing\n4delegation of HR and employee relations matters to managers at local level; the spread of HRM\ntechniques and reduced significance of industry level collective bargaining (Bach et al., 2009).\nUp until the 1980s governments had attempted to adopt the role of the \u2018model employer\u2019, based on\nthe principles of fairness, involvement and equity and acted as an example to the private sector.\nBach et al. (2009) argue that since then, in a restructured public sector, successive governments\nhave encouraged closer alignment of HR policies and local managerial needs in order to\nencourage greater efficiency, which have in some circumstances challenged the notion of the\n\u2018good employer\u2019. There has been some debate over the extent to which the public sector and\npublic service employment in particular, have retained their distinguishing features (Bach 2002:\nWinchester and Bach, 1995), but for our purposes it is important to compare practice in the\nvoluntary sector with contemporary approaches in the public and private sectors. If government\nhas used the public sector as a venue for change and the implementation of desired policies, then\nit could be argued it will seek to use its purchasing power to influence practice in similar ways.\nIn this context it is also relevant to compare the findings for the voluntary sector with those of the\nprivate sector. If the intention of NPM is to introduce private sector management practices into\nthe public sector, then contracting power may be used as a direct means to influence management\nin the voluntary sector in a similar way.\nBach, et al. (2009) examined change in the public sector using the WERS data, focusing\nspecifically on four areas: performance-oriented practices; welfare-oriented practices; pay\ndetermination; employee representation and union organisation. Bach et al 2009 define welfare\noriented practices as those procedures designed to ensure that disputes and grievances are dealt\nwith fairly, provide high levels of job security, a variety of equal employment opportunities and\nuniversal pension provision, as opposed to performance-oriented practices that that are designed to\nmaximise the performance of employees. For the purposes of comparability, we adopt a similar\napproach in this paper, focusing on the two of these areas - \u2013 performance oriented and welfare-\noriented practices. A performance-orientation is associated with NPM and a welfare-orientation\nwith the model employer approach.\nMethod\nThe data presented here are drawn from the 2004 Workplace Employment Relations Survey\n(WERS 2004). WERS is an establishment-based survey that includes detailed information\nemployment relations in UK workplaces. The survey has been conducted in one form or another\nfive times since 1980. We will focus on the 2004 survey here since this was the first time that\n5voluntary sector organisations were identified as a separate group (previously included in the\n\u201cother\u201d category). Our analysis uses data from the cross-section management questionnaire where\nthe principal unit of analysis is the workplace (a workplace is defined as comprising the activities\nof a single employer at a single set of premises). Data were collected through face-to-face\ninterviews with the senior person in each workplace with responsibility for industrial relations,\nemployee relations or personnel management. These included a series of questions about HRM\nand employee relations policies and practices as well as a number of questions about the nature of\nthe workforce. Fieldwork for the WERS 2004 Cross-Section began in February 2004 and was\ncompleted in April 20051.\nThe scope of the WERS 2004 Cross-Section extends to cover all workplaces with 5+\nemployees, located in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). The data is based upon\ninterviews with 2295 establishments. These respondents were identified from the Inter-\nDepartmental Business Register (IDBR) maintained by the UK Office for National Statistics. This\nrepresents a response rate of 64% (3586 establishments approached).\nFor the purpose of our analysis, we used the responses to questions in two areas:\nperformance-oriented practices and welfare-oriented practices; in line with Bach et al. (2009)\nanalysis of the public sector. These are all single item measures. Over recent years there has been\nsome move away from the use of single item measures in HRM research, towards the use of\nbundles or \u201cconfigurations\u201d (Delery and Doty, 1996) of practices. Rather than follow this\napproach, we decided to retain the single item measures from WERS for two reasons. Firstly, this\npaper is based on the precedent of Bach et al (2009) and therefore we have used the same single\nitem measures. Secondly, the data does not lend itself easily to the creation of bundles. When\nbundles were created, based on the literature and a Principal Components Analysis, the internal\nconsistency (Cronbach\u2019s Alpha) within each cluster was low (under 0.70). In order to compare\nHRM and employee relations practices in voluntary sector organisations with those in public\nsector organisations and in private sector organisations, we conducted a series of two group chi-\nsquare analyses.\nFindings\nThe sample consisted of 2051 organisations who indicated their industry sector - 92 voluntary\norganisations, 1370 private sector organisations and 589 public sector organisations. The mean\n1 Full details of the methodology used can be found at http:\/\/www.wers2004.info\/wers2004\/wers2004.php\n6number of employees in each sector was 402.99 for the voluntary sector, 276.18 for the private\nsector and 761.23 for the public sector. This suggests that, in terms of size, both the private and\npublic sector organisations provide suitable comparators for the voluntary sector organisations.\nThe industries represented in each sector are detailed in table 1 below.\n(Take in Table 1)\nIt is noteworthy that health and education account for the majority of organisations in the\nvoluntary and public sectors, whereas manufacturing and retail are more common in the private\nsector. Consequently, similarities and differences between the sectors may also be influenced by\nindustry composition rather than sector per se.\n(Take in table 2)\nIt might be expected that the impact of NPM would be a greater focus on performance related HR\npractices. Bach et al. (2009) have noted an increasing use of HRM practices in the public sector,\nessentially concerned with contributing towards organisational performance (Paauwe, 2009). The\ndata show that the use of appraisals and off the job training is reported by a large proportion of\nvoluntary sector employers, suggesting that a focus on performance is in place. Furthermore,\nemployee appraisals resulted in an evaluation of the training needs in nearly all (96.5%) cases.\nThe use of various communication and employee involvement schemes designed to improve\norganisational performance were also reported by many voluntary sector employers, in particular\nthe use of briefing groups, dissemination of information about the financial position of the\norganisation and staffing plans. The common use of these communication tools in the voluntary\nsector may not be surprising, since voluntary sector employees tend be committed to their\norganisations\u2019 cause and may therefore be both willing and interested in contributing to\nperformance. Such mechanisms may also be seen as a means of supporting the mutuality of\npurpose (Cunningham, 2010).\nThough the findings for the voluntary sector shows that performance oriented practices are\nwidespread, the results do not show a clear cut relationship with either the public or private\nsectors. There are a number of practices where there is a high degree of uniformity across the\nsectors including the aforementioned performance appraisals for all non-managerial employees,\nthe use of suggestion schemes and the provision of information to employees about investment\nplans, the financial position and the organisation\u2019s final position. Voluntary sector organisations\n7differed significantly from both the public (p<0.05) and private sector (p<0.01), in terms of\nproviding information about staffing plans. Voluntary sector organisations were significantly\ndifferent from the private sector in the provision of off-the-job training, and the use of briefing\ngroups, though not significantly different from the public sector. Off-the-job training in the\nvoluntary sector also indicates significant differences from the other two sectors though this may\nbe explained by the predominance of health and education employers who tend to rely heavily on\noff-the-job training. For other practices, voluntary organisations were more similar to the private\nsector and were significantly different from the public sector \u2013 specifically, the use of problem\nsolving groups, systematic use of the management chain for communication and the use of\nnewsletters. It should be noted that in each case, other than for the use of performance appraisals\nand the provision of information on the organisation\u2019s financial position, the public sector\norganisations were most likely to use the performance model practices.\n(Take in table 3)\nExamining the welfare-oriented practices identified by Bach et al (2009), the picture was also\nmixed, with no consistent evidence of the voluntary sector organisations being more similar to the\npublic than the private sector. Voluntary organisations were only similar to the public sector and\nsignificantly different to the private sector in the use of three practices \u2013 offering flexitime,\noffering home working and the existence of an individual grievance procedure. In each case the\nvoluntary and public sector organisations were more likely to use the practice. Whilst the figures\nfor flexible working practices suggest a greater welfare orientation, it should be noted that since\nthe data were collected the legislative provisions concerning flexible working have been extended\nand as a result these figures may have changed in more recent times. Furthermore, studies from\nparts of the voluntary sector which have been subject to increasingly intense competition suggest\nthat flexible working options have been used as a means of compensation for lower than public\nsector rates of pay, rather than a reflection of a welfare-orientation per se (Parry and Kelliher,\n2009).\nVoluntary sector organisations were similar to the private sector, but significantly different\nfrom the public sector, in their provision of sick pay over the statutory minimum, use of collective\ndisputes procedures and disciplinary procedures. Voluntary and private sector organisations were\nmore likely to offer sick pay over the statutory minimum but less likely to have a collective\ndisputes or disciplinary procedure. For three practices, the voluntary sector organisations were\nsignificantly different from both the public and private sector organisations. These practices were:\n8having an equal opportunities policy, offering job-sharing and employer pension schemes. For\nequal opportunities policies and employer pension schemes the public sector was more likely to\nhave adopted these policies, followed by the voluntary sector and then the private sector. Offering\njob share schemes was more prevalent in the voluntary sector followed by the public sector and\nthen the private sector.\nDiscussion and Conclusions\nWERS 2004 for the first time in the series separated out responses from voluntary sector\norganisations. This has allowed a picture of employee relations and HRM practices across the\nsector to emerge to emerge, complementing existing in-depth studies which have tended to focus\non only one part of the voluntary sector. In this article we have used the WERS 2004 data to\nexamine the use of HRM practices in the form of performance orientated and welfare oriented\npractices, mirroring the analysis of Bach et al (2009) for the public sector.\nOverall the data present a fairly positive picture of HRM practice in the voluntary sector.\nPerformance oriented practices such as performance appraisal and off the job training appear to be\nwidespread. Equally, the use of communication and involvement practices designed to contribute\nto performance were all also reported by many employers, perhaps reflecting the mutuality of\npurpose between managers and employees and more participatory ethos in voluntary sector\norganisations (Cunningham, 2010; Van Til, 2000; Weisbrod, 1998). Welfare oriented HR\npractices, particularly those designed to ensure fairness such as equal opportunities practices and\ngrievance and disciplinary procedures were reported by nearly all voluntary sector respondents.\nThis would fit with the value-driven approach characteristic of voluntary sector organisations\n(Ridder and McCandless, 2010). Similarly, flexible working arrangements, although there were\nsome variations between forms, were offered by the majority of employers. Employer pension\nschemes were also provided by most organisations.\nWith the introduction of NPM as the pivot point (Baines, 2004; Cunningham, 2001; Evans\nand Shields, 2002), HRM in the voluntary sector has been subject to far reaching change in recent\nyears (Parry and Kelliher, 2009; Rodwell and Teo, 2004), however the lack of longitudinal data\ndoes not allow for comparisons to be made with earlier datasets that might track and confirm the\ndepth of these changes. However, in an attempt to explore this change with a wider dataset and\nwhether the nature of change has been shaped by increased involvement with government, we\ncompared these findings from the literature concerning traditional models of HRM in the\nvoluntary sector and with WERS responses from the public sector. In view of changes in the\n9public sector, driven by the NPM agenda, we also made comparisons with the private sector.\nTaken together, the HRM practices reported in the WERS data suggest a departure from\ntraditional approaches in the voluntary sector that have tended to lack sophistication in the eyes of\nsome (Lloyd, 1993; Butler and Wilson, 1990) and a more participatory, social-justice orientation\nin the eyes of others (Baines, 2010; Evans and Shields; 2002; Van Til, 2000). Our conclusions are\nalso in line with the findings of recent studies that have identified change in HR approaches\nadopted in parts of the voluntary sector (see for example, Kellock Hay et al. 2001; Parry and\nKelliher, 2009).\nIn comparison to the public sector there were many similarities but also differences.\nPerformance oriented practices such as the use of appraisal and off the job training showed\nsimilarities. Though overall, the public sector reported greater use of communication practices\ndesigned to contribute to organisational performance than did the other two sectors. This may, at\nleast in part, be explained by a higher degree of formalisation resulting from higher levels of trade\nunion recognition in the public sector. There were also similarities in the use of welfare oriented\npolicies, although the voluntary sector generally reported lower levels of adoption. This change\nmight be explained by government using its purchasing power to require contractors to conform to\ncertain standards (Alatrista and Arrowsmith, 2004, Cunningham, 2008) as well as a time lag\ninvolved in their full implementation. When compared to the literature on traditional HR practices\nin the voluntary sector, the data suggest that government has had influence on practice within the\nvoluntary sector and some similarities with public sector HR are evident (Leat, 1993)..\nIn contrast, the private sector reports overall; lower levels of adoption of both performance\nand welfare oriented HR practices than either the voluntary or public sectors. At one level this is\nsurprising given and the widespread view that NPM principles are very compatible with the\nprivate market and therein found their origins and inspiration (Davies, 2008; Evans and Shields,\n2002; McDonald and Marston, 2002). The WERS includes a range of private sector\norganisations, spanning HRM innovators to \u2018bleak house\u2019 employers (Sisson, 1993), representing\na wide range of better and less desirable HR practices.\nThe data suggest some convergence with the public sector, which has itself undergone\nsignificant change (McDonald and Marston, 2002). at the 2004 WERS data and subsector specific\nstudies (Baines, 2010, 2006; Brainard and Siplon, 2004; Cunningham, 2008; Parry et al, 2005),\nseem to confirm that many of the HR changes observed in this sector have been advanced through\ngovernment contracting-out and the standards required of funded agencies and the larger influence\nof NPM. Ironically, while NPM may find its origins and inspiration in the private market,\nperformance management practices are much more evident in the public and voluntary sectors\n10\nthan the private sector itself, suggesting that government is leading this pro-market remake of the\nvoluntary sector.\nThe generalisability of these findings may be limited by the small sample size of voluntary\nsector organisations. In addition, the lack of longitudinal data on the voluntary sector in the\nWERS series means that that there are limitations on our ability to assess change over time in the\nvoluntary sector.\n11\nReferences\nAlatrista, J. and Arrowsmith, J.
