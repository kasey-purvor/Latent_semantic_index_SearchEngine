We varied these\nparameters in the context of a simulated Amazon rainforest ecosystem containing\nseven plant functional types (PFTs) that varied along a trade-off surface between\ngrowth and the risk of starvation induced mortality.\n\u2022 Varying the five unconstrained parameters generated community structures\nranging from monocultures to equal co-dominance of the seven PFTs. When\nexposed to a climate change scenario, the competing impacts of CO2 fertilization\nand increasing plant mortality caused ecosystem biomass to diverge substantially\nbetween simulations, with mid-21st century biomass predictions ranging from 1.5\nto 27.0 kg C m)2.\n\u2022 Filtering the results using contemporary observation ranges of biomass, leaf area\nindex (LAI), gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP)\ndid not substantially constrain the potential outcomes. We conclude that demo-\ngraphic processes represent a large source of uncertainty in DGVM predictions.\nIntroduction\nThe terrestrial biosphere plays a critical role in regulating\nthe Earth\u2019s carbon cycle (Bonan, 2008). There is concern\nthat terrestrial ecosystems may be unable to maintain the\ncurrent uptake of c. 33% of anthropogenic emissions\n(Rodenbeck et al., 2003; Zeng et al., 2005) because of\nthe anticipated negative impact of heating and drying\non photosynthesis and survival (Cox et al., 2000;\nFriedlingstein et al., 2006). For this reason, Dynamic\nGlobal Vegetation Models (DGVMs), are now recognized\nas a critical component of climate change prediction.\nDGVM models simulate a suite of ecosystem properties\nfrom half-hourly carbon and water exchange, through daily\ngrowth and tissue turnover, to longer-term processes of\nreproduction, competition, and mortality. These models\nhave become relatively advanced in their capability to simu-\nlate short-term surface gas and energy exchanges and atmo-\nspheric CO2 (Sellers et al., 1986; Hickler et al., 2008;\nPurves & Pacala, 2008; Mercado et al., 2009; Randerson\net al., 2009); by contrast, DGVMs contain relatively simple\nand poorly tested representations of the processes driving\nNew\nPhytologistResearch\n666 New Phytologist (2010) 187: 666\u2013681\nwww.newphytologist.com\n\u0002 The Authors (2010)\nJournal compilation \u0002 New Phytologist Trust (2010)\nlong-term changes in vegetation composition \u2013 for example\nrecruitment, competition and tree mortality (Moorcroft,\n2006). The large structural and parametric uncertainty con-\ncerning these processes means that existing DGVMs\nproduce a wide variety of predictions regarding the future\nstrength and direction of the climate carbon cycle feedback\n(Friedlingstein et al., 2006; Thornton et al., 2007; Sitch\net al., 2008). For example, some models predict cata-\nstrophic declines in the Amazon and Boreal forests, while\nothers predict relatively stable ecosystem composition and\ncarbon storage, even with the same future climate drivers\n(as illustrated by Sitch et al., 2008). Model biases intro-\nduced by these uncertainties are not readily estimated\nbecause limited observations exist to constrain demographic\nprocesses under rapidly altering climates (Purves & Pacala,\n2008; Allen et al., 2010).\nIn an attempt to increase ecological realism in DGVMs,\nmore sophisticated models have recently been developed\nthat explicitly represent the demographic processes of dis-\nturbance, recruitment, competition between plant types for\nlight, and tree mortality (Friend & White, 2000; Moorcroft\net al., 2001; Sato et al., 2007; Hickler et al., 2008; Scheiter\n& Higgins, 2008). This \u2018second generation\u2019 approach has\nnumerous perceived benefits, including the ability to model\nregrowth after disturbance, parameterize ecological dynamics\ndirectly using tree and plot scale data, and to facilitate\nthe representation of coexistence of different vegetation\ntypes by introducing different environmental niches, either\nalong a successional gradient of light availability or vertical\nstrata in the canopy (Moorcroft et al., 2001; Smith et al.,\n2001; Purves & Pacala, 2008). The impact of this third\nproperty \u2013 the ability to simulate competition and co-\nexistence of multiple plant types \u2013 is unclear. Successful\ncoexistence of multiple plant functional types (PFTs) might\nbuffer responses to climate change by preventing sudden\nswitches between mono-dominant PFTs. Conversely, rela-\ntively stable past climates might discourage the survival of\nthose plant types which invest more resources in the toler-\nance of extreme climates, at the expense of PFTs with rapid\ngrowth rates, making ecosystems in general more susceptible\nto the effects of climate shifts.\nTo resolve this issue, it is necessary to understand the\nprocesses that control community structure in second-\ngeneration models. In this paper, we present developments\nto a second-generation DGVM that facilitate the coexis-\ntence of plant functional types. We then identify several\npoorly constrained processes that fundamentally influence\nhow community structure emerges from plant demography.\nThese include seed advection, seed mixing, sapling mortal-\nity, competitive exclusion and stress-induced tree mortality.\nWhile representations of these ecological processes are typi-\ncally present in current DGVMs, they all depend upon\ntwo-dimensional spatial scales not represented by these\nmodels. For example, rates of seed mixing and advection\nrates are properties of landscape heterogeneity, while the\nstochasticity or determinism of competitive exclusion and\nthe rate of tree mortality under stress are both properties of\nmultiscale environmental heterogeneity (Clark et al., 2007).\nDGVMs are spatially one-dimensional, as they consider\nsingle points in space that do not interact with one-another.\nTherefore, it is not possible to explicitly represent these pro-\ncesses in the current modelling context, and instead their\nimpact must be parameterized. In this paper, we identify\nfive demographic processes whose outcome depends on the\nsub-grid spatial heterogeneity of a landscape, and investigate\nhow the parameterizations affect the outcome of a one-\ndimensional dynamic vegetation model.\nIn this paper, we use the Ecosystem Demography model\n(ED, Moorcroft et al., 2001), a size- and age-structured\nDGVM that occupies a mid-point on the continuum from\ngap models (Sato et al., 2007; Hickler et al., 2008) that\ncontain representations of individual trees, to area-based\nDGVMs, which model the fate of a single average individual\nfor each PFT (Cox, 2001; Bonan et al., 2003; Sitch et al.,\n2003; Woodward & Lomas, 2004; Krinner et al., 2005).\nBecause of this, ED is perceived as a promising template for\na second generation of land surface models, appropriate for\ninclusion in large-scale climate simulations (Meir et al.,\n2006; Moorcroft, 2006; Prentice et al., 2007; Huntingford\net al., 2008; Purves & Pacala, 2008).\nDescription\nBackground\nIn order to provide a realistic context for our study, we situ-\nate our hypothetical ecosystem in the eastern Amazon basin,\nand parameterize carbon fluxes and plant allocation using\nrecently compiled data from three intensively studied forest\nplots (Malhi et al., 2009b). Further details are given in\nSupporting Information Notes S1 and Table 2. A majority\nof Global Climate Models, (GCMs) predict that dry season\nrainfall over Amazonia will decline (Malhi et al., 2009a),\nand that temperatures will increase (Salazar et al., 2007).\nThis makes the Amazon an ideal place to investigate the\nimpact of alternative community structures on future vege-\ntation structure and function. For a more complete review\non prognoses for the Amazon rainforest see Cox et al. (2004,\n2008), Huntingford et al. (2008), Malhi et al. (2008,\n2009b), Meir et al. (2008) and Nepstad et al. (2008).\nEcosystem Demography model\nThe ED model is a size- and age-structural approximation\nof a gap model, the state structure of which is a nested\nhierarchy of geographical grid cells, landscape age-classes\nand cohorts of trees of different sizes and PFTs. The\nlandscape age-classes are designed to capture horizontal\nNew\nPhytologist Research 667\n\u0002 The Authors (2010)\nJournal compilation \u0002 New Phytologist Trust (2010)\nNew Phytologist (2010) 187: 666\u2013681\nwww.newphytologist.com\nbiotic heterogeneity in canopy structure that arises from\nvarious forms of disturbance. Biotic heterogeneity does not\ninclude physical aspects of sub-grid heterogeneity such as\nvariations in altitude, soils or aspect. These are not\naccounted for in the model structure. At each daily time-\nstep, canopy tree mortality creates new areas of disturbed\nground. To make the model computationally more\nefficient, the spatial locations of the disturbed areas are not\nspecified, and thus can be tracked as a single landscape age-\nclass that represents the aggregation of canopy-gap sized\nareas within each grid cell that were disturbed at a similar\ntime in the past. To minimize the proliferation of landscape\nage-classes, the vertical structure and composition of model\nland classes are continually compared with each other and\nmerged if they are sufficiently similar.\nNew juvenile individuals of each PFT are recruited on a\ndaily time-step, based on the reproductive output of exist-\ning individuals of the same PFT. Individuals located in the\nsame landscape age-class, PFT and size, are tracked as\n\u2018cohorts\u2019. Each cohort is defined by the number of individ-\nuals per unit area (nc), and a single representative tree,\ndefined by its structural biomass (bs), which is a function of\ntree diameter D (cm), and live biomass (ba), which consists\nof leaf (bl), fine root (br) and sapwood (bsw) (all in kg C per\nindividual yr)1). As with the landscape age-classes, cohorts\nare continually compared and subsequently fused if they\nare in the same PFT, landscape age-class and are close in\nsize. Through this procedure, the ED model explicitly\ntracks horizontal and vertical heterogeneity in canopy\nstructure.\nIn the next section, we discuss model representations of\nrecruitment, competition and mortality. Because these\nprocesses operate in two-dimensional spatial space and\ntherefore have no analogue in a one-dimensional model,\nparameterization from field observations is difficult. We\nintroduced modifications to these processes, but unless\notherwise stated, the model is the same as EDv1.0, as\ndescribed by Moorcroft et al. (2001). Alterations made to\nthe energy and gas exchange algorithms are described in\nNotes S1.\nModelling sapling recruitment\nSapling recruitment is the sum of plant reproduction from\nlocal (internal) and nonlocal (external) sources. The smallest\nunits considered by the model are 2.5 m high saplings, we\ndo not model the germination of seeds and early seedling\ndevelopment, but seed dispersal processes are nevertheless\nresponsible for the location of the resultant saplings.\nExternal recruitment represents the advection of seeds from\nother geographical areas. Seed advection (As) from multiple\ndirections, results in a point-specific sapling establishment\nrate measured in individuals m)2 per PFT)1 yr)1. As the\ndistribution of different environmental conditions within a\ngrid cell is not represented in the model, we use the null\nassumption that PFT advection is constant through time\nand that the number of saplings recruited per PFT is equal.\nFor internal recruitment, a fixed fraction, frepro of the car-\nbon available for growth (Cg, Eqn 7) is partitioned into\nreproduction. The number of saplings per PFT is calculated\nfrom this carbon supply divided by the biomass required to\nmake each 2.5 m sapling. The internally generated saplings\nare distributed between landscape age-classes. This requires\nan estimate of Xm: the probability that a propagule gener-\nated in one landscape age class establishes in a different\nlandscape class from that of its parents. In other words, Xm\nrepresents how well mixed seeds are across a landscape with\nrespect to the landscape age-class gradient. Low levels of\n\u2018seed mixing\u2019 mean that seeds are likely to land near their\nparent tree, and vice-versa. Subsequently, a \u2018sapling mortality\u2019\nis applied (Ms) the value of which represents the dis-\ncrepancy between the maximum number of saplings and\nthe number that are realized in the model. The total\nnumber of new established saplings in each time-step,\nNsapling, is therefore:\nNsapling \u00bc As \u00fe Cg\u00f01\u0002Ms\u00de=\u00f0freprob0\u00det Eqn 1\nwhere t, length of each daily time-step, in years (1 \u2044365);\nand b0 is the sapling biomass.\nThe parameters As and Xm both depend upon the spatial\nstructure of the landscape and the likelihood of ecosystems\nwith different composition existing in close proximity. In a\ntwo-dimensional spatial model of interconnected patches\n(Kneitel & Chase, 2003; Leibold et al., 2004; Lischke\net al., 2006) parameters representing the spatial movement\nof propagules would not be necessary, as they would be\nmodelled with diffusion type equations; however, without\nthis capacity, we must parameterize the processes of seed\ndispersal within a grid cell. Here, we investigate how the\nparameterization of seed advection and seed mixing affect\ncommunity structure in a sensitivity analysis.\nModelling canopy structure and coexistence\nIn the original EDv1.0 model (Moorcroft et al., 2001)\nthere were no explicit spatial dimensions associated with\neach cohort, so the hypothetical leaf area of each tree\nextended across the entire surface of the landscape age class,\neffectively creating a steep vertical light profile that caused\nunrealistic levels of shade-induced competitive exclusion\nand reduced the capacity to simulate coexistence of plants\nwithin a successional age class. Resolving these issues\nrequires representation of the physical dimension of tree\ncrowns. We adopted and modified the Perfect Plasticity\nApproximation (PPA) of Purves et al. (2008b). Based on\nthe observation that tree crowns often occupy gaps in the\ncanopy that are spatially dislocated from the base of the tree,\n668 Research\nNew\nPhytologist\n\u0002 The Authors (2010)\nJournal compilation \u0002 New Phytologist Trust (2010)\nNew Phytologist (2010) 187: 666\u2013681\nwww.newphytologist.com\nPPA assumes that the horizontal plasticity of crown location\nand shape is infinite but that trees have realistic relation-\nships between crown area and height. The end result is that\nwhen the total canopy area is greater than the total ground\narea, the canopy is considered to be \u2018closed\u2019 and breaks into\ndistinct layers, each consisting of those cohorts with heights\nwithin a particular range, such that each cohort occurs in\nonly one layer; in a situation with two layers, that is, canopy\nand understory, the cohorts are assigned to the canopy or\nunderstory according to their height relative to a mean\ncanopy intersection height \u2018z*\u2019. Trees within the same layer\ndo not shade each other at all and trees in a given layer are\nuniformly shaded according to the total leaf area index\n(LAI) above the top height of that layer. This scheme means\nthat a small increase in height of a cohort no longer confers\na large competitive advantage, except where cohorts cross\nz*.\nThe original version of the PPA model assumes that z* is\nspatially uniform within a stand; however, canopy inter-\nsection heights vary spatially such that a tree of height \u2018h\u2019\nmight sometimes be in the canopy and sometimes be in\nthe understory, depending on its circumstances. The\nassumption that z* is spatially uniform, exacerbated by the\nfact that ED typically aggregates the canopy into far fewer\ncohorts than the original PPA method of Purves et al.,\n2008b, generates a highly deterministic model of competi-\ntion, whereby a single cohort with a small height advantage\nmight come to quickly and unrealistically dominate the\nentire canopy. It is therefore difficult to represent coexis-\ntence between similar PFTs without including some potential\nfor z* to be heterogeneous. Clark et al. (2003, 2007) pro-\npose that deterministic models of coexistence often fail\nbecause they do not properly account for unobserved life-\nhistory trade-offs, neglected genetic variation or spatial\nheterogeneity in topology, soil type, aspect and dispersal\nand recruitment processes, they term these factors \u2018random\nindividual effects\u2019. In the context of the PPA model, this is\nanalogous to the possibility that z* is spatially hetero-\ngeneous.\nWe introduced the potential influence of \u2018random\nindividual effects\u2019 on community composition by aggregating\nall the processes that suppress the ability of the fastest grow-\ning PFTs to monopolize resources into a single \u2018competitive\nexclusion\u2019 parameter Ce. This parameter controls the proba-\nbility that a tree of a given height will obtain a space in the\ncanopy of a closed forest. The forest canopy is considered as\nclosed when the total canopy area (Acanopy, m\n2), which is\nthe sum of all the crown areas (Acrown, m\n2)\nAcanopy \u00bc\nX\nAcrown; Eqn 2\nexceeds the ground area of the age class in question (Ap).\nUnder these circumstances, the \u2018extra\u2019 crown area Aloss\n(Acanopy ) Ap) is moved into the understorey. For each\ncohort already in the canopy, we determine a fraction of\ntrees that are lost from the canopy (Lc) and moved to the\nunderstory. Lc is calculated as\nLc \u00bc Alosswc=\nX\n\u00f0wc\u00de; Eqn 3\nwhere wc is a weighting of each cohort determined by basal\ndiameter D (cm) and the competitive exclusion coefficient\nCe\nwc \u00bc DCe Eqn 4\nThe higher the value of Ce, the greater the impact of tree\ndiameter on the probability of a given tree obtaining a position\nin the canopy layer. That is, for high Ce values, compe-\ntition is highly deterministic. Small average differences\nbetween cohorts are still significant because there is little\nrandomness at the scale of individual trees. Therefore,\nfaster-growing trees monopolize light resources more\neffectively, leading to competitive exclusion of slower-\ngrowing trees. By contrast, low values of Ce imply that the\noutcome of competition is stochastic: small differences\nbetween cohorts do not matter greatly because randomness\nat the scale of individual trees is such that all cohorts suffer\napproximately equally from competition for canopy space.\nThe smaller the value of Ce, the greater the influence of\nrandom factors on the competitive exclusion process, and\nthe higher the probability that slower-growing trees will get\ninto the canopy. Appropriate values of Ce are poorly con-\nstrained (Clark et al., 2003, 2007), thus we investigated the\neffects of a wide range of Ce values on community structure\nand biomass predictions.\nModelling plant mortality\nModelling community composition requires accurate simu-\nlation of the processes controlling mortality of different\nplant types. Mechanistic prediction of plant mortality is\ncurrently a developing field (McDowell et al., 2008) and\nthe dominant mechanism of death remains unclear. Two\npotential physiological mechanisms underlying plant\nsusceptibility to climate extremes and attack by biotic mor-\ntality agents include hydraulic failure caused by excessive\nxylem embolism and carbon starvation because of stomatal\nclosure and subsequent depletion of available carbohydrate\nreserves used for maintenance and defence. Although not\nyet understood sufficiently well to model, metabolic limita-\ntions induced by restrictions on phloem transport and tissue\ndehydration may exacerbate carbon starvation (Ko\u00a8rner,\n2003; McDowell & Sevanto, 2010; Sala et al., 2010).\nIsohydric plants, which close their stomata during drought\nNew\nPhytologist Research 669\n\u0002 The Authors (2010)\nJournal compilation \u0002 New Phytologist Trust (2010)\nNew Phytologist (2010) 187: 666\u2013681\nwww.newphytologist.com\nconditions, may be more likely to suffer carbon starvation\nthan hydraulic failure (McDowell et al., 2008, Adams et al.,\n2009). Fisher et al. (2006) observed that leaf physiology\nwas consistent with isohydric habit in Amazonian rainforest\ntrees and Metcalfe et al. (2010) provide evidence suggesting\nthat the carbon budget and timing of death of artificially\ndroughted rainforest trees is consistent with death from car-\nbon starvation. Therefore, in this paper, we concentrate on\ncarbon starvation as the likely mode of mortality. To simu-\nlate carbon starvation, we define a new \u2018stored carbon\u2019 pool,\nbstore (kg C per individual), and model allocation to this\npool using the widespread observation that relative parti-\ntioning of photosynthate to storage increases during periods\nwhen photosynthesis is low (Gibon et al., 2009; McDowell\n& Sevanto, 2010; Smith & Stitt, 2007). Allocation to the\nstore is thus altered according to the size of the existing pool\nand a \u2018target\u2019 quantity S*, multiplied by leaf biomass, bl. S*\nis an indicator of the generic strategy plants undertake to\navoid carbon starvation. The more carbon that is kept back\nfor storage, the more likely it is that a plant can survive periods\nof negative carbon assimilation (McDowell et al., 2008).\nThe carbon balance (Cb) available for storage, growth and\nreproduction is determined as\nCb \u00bc NPP\u0002 md Eqn 5\nthe balance of net primary productivity (NPP) and tissue\nturnover requirements (md, see Notes S1), both in kg C per\nindividual yr)1). The balance of stored carbon to target\nstored carbon fs:\nfs \u00bc bstore=\u00f0S \u0003bl\u00de Eqn 6\nis used to predict the flux of carbon to the storage pool as a\nfraction of the carbon balance (fstore)\nfstore \u00bc e\u00024fs Eqn 7\nThe form of the function depicts a situation whereby\ncarbon allocation approaches 1.0 when the store is low,\nand approaches zero when the store is higher than the\ntarget quantity. Flux to and from the store is calculated\nas:\nDbstore \u00bc Cb :fstore Eqn 8\nThus if Cb is negative (if NPP is less than maintenance\ndemands, such as in winter or drought periods) carbon is\nremoved from the store. Mortality increases as bstore\ndeclines below a threshold (see Eqn 10), so negative bstore is\navoided by gradual cohort death. Otherwise, the carbon\nremaining for growth and reproduction (Cg, kg C per\nindividual yr)1) is what remains once allocation to the store\nhas been removed.\nCg \u00bc Cb\u00f01:0\u0002 fstore\u00de Eqn 9\nBecause each cohort in ED represents the hypothetical\nmeans of a set of trees with broadly similar but nonetheless\nvariable genetic composition and environmental conditions,\nthe prediction of mortality based on a single threshold car-\nbon storage value is inappropriate. In this case, we model\nmortality rate M (fraction of trees dying yr)1) as a function\nof the ratio of bstore to leaf biomass where bstore < bl\nM \u00bc Bm \u00fe Smmin\u00f01:0; \u00f0bl \u0002 bstore\u00de=bl Eqn 10\nBackground mortality, Bm, (1.39% yr\n)1, Chao et al.\n(2008) occurs irrespective of the stress on the carbon store.\nSm is the mortality rate (fraction yr\n)1) of a single cohort\nwhen mean cohort carbon storage is zero. The value of Sm is\nalso affected by spatial heterogeneity. In the hypothetical\n\u2018average\u2019 stand modelled by a DGVM, an \u2018average\u2019 tree may\ndie (making its observed mortality 100%) because its car-\nbon reserves fall to zero. In reality it is unlikely that, across a\nwhole grid cell, all of the trees in a given PFT and size class\nwill die simultaneously. Because we can neither parameterize\neffectively nor simulate the sub-grid cell heterogeneities that\nlead to the discrepancy between stand-level and landscape-\nlevel mortality, it is necessary to parameterize the variable\nSm as the impact of carbon deficit on mortality rates.\nPlant functional types\nPlant ecology models typically seek to explain the coexis-\ntence of species along functional \u2018trade-offs\u2019 (Pacala et al.,\n1996; Moorcroft et al., 2001; Kneitel & Chase, 2003;\nBaraloto et al., 2005; Falster 2006). These compromises in\nplant form and function mean that no species is the best\ncompetitor in all environments. We use variation in S* to\nrepresent an example of a growth vs mortality risk trade-off\nsurface (Hacke et al., 2006; Poorter et al., 2010). We con-\nstrain S* using measurements of carbon storage from a rain-\nforest in Panama (Wu\u00a8rth et al., 2005), in which the average\namount of carbon stored in trees was approximately the\nsame as that required to replace all of the leaf and fine root\nbiomass. Notably, variation between species was substantial.\nWe calculated the range of carbon stored between species\nusing the data on percentage carbon storage in different\ntissues, and the mean biomass of each tissue type (Wu\u00a8rth\net al., 2005), and found that carbon storage varied by a\nfactor of 2.4 (or 3.7, if one species with extremely high\nlevels of stem carbohydrate was taken into account).\nReflecting this, we created an array of seven tropical, ever-\ngreen PFTs that differed in S* from 1.0 for PFT2, to 2.5\nfor PFT7 (Table 1). The additional properties of these\nPFTs are described in Table 2. Each PFT represents a class\nof species that is broadleaf, evergreen and tropical, but with\na specific range of carbon storage behaviour.\n670 Research\nNew\nPhytologist\n\u0002 The Authors (2010)\nJournal compilation \u0002 New Phytologist Trust (2010)\nNew Phytologist (2010) 187: 666\u2013681\nwww.newphytologist.com\nMethods\nTo develop a DGVM capable of predicting vegetation con-\nditions under altered climate and CO2, we coupled the\nadapted ED model to the Met Office Surface Exchange\nScheme (MOSES II, Essery et al., 2003), that has recently\nevolved into joint UK land environment simulator (JULES)\n(Mercado et al., 2007). JULES calculates the land surface\ngas exchange and provides fluxes of carbon to ED, which\ngenerates land surface and canopy structure to drive the\nland-atmosphere interactions in return. We term the cou-\npled model JULES-ED.\nWe drove JULES-ED using output from the IMOGEN\nanalogue climate model (Huntingford & Cox, 2000).\nIMOGEN utilizes pattern output from the Hadley Centre\nHADCM3-LC Global Circulation Model (Cox et al.,\n2000) to provide climatic anomalies between a baseline\nclimate and a given climate change scenario. In this\ninstance, we use the Climate Research Unit (CRU,\nUniversity of East Anglia, Norwich, UK.) 1900\u20131999\nclimatology as a baseline dataset onto which we superim-\npose these anomalies. In order to use both the historical\nclimatology for spin-up, and the pattern output from the\nGCM to generate forward predictions, the simulations are\nnot site specific. Instead, we utilize data from Malhi et al.\n(2009b) who synthesized observations of the carbon econ-\nomy of three Amazonian sites (Manaus, Caxiuana\u02dc and\nTapajo`s) to parameterize the ecophysiology of rainforest\necosystems (see Notes S1). We use driving climatologies for\na 3.25 \u00b7 2.5 grid cell, the south west corner of which is\nlocated at 56.25\u0003W and )2.5\u0003S, encompassing all three\nsites used by Malhi et al. (2009b).\nModel sensitivity tests\nTo investigate how uncertainties in the parameterization of\ndemographic processes affect the development of commu-\nnity structure, we conducted a global sensitivity test to five\nparameters; seed advection (As), seed mixing (Xm), sapling\nmortality (Ms), competitive exclusion (Ce) and stress-\ninduced adult mortality rate (Sm). For each parameter, we\nset high and low parameter boundaries and conducted a\n200-member Latin Hypercube exploration (Iman &\nConover, 1982) of the five-dimensional parameter space to\nidentify how different combinations of these processes affect\ncommunity structure. The parameter ranges for Xm, Ce and\nSm were between zero and one because these were the logical\nendpoints of these processes.

This climate change scenario is\namong the most extreme for Amazonia (Malhi et al.,\n2009a), but appears consistent with recent climate variability\nin this region (Cox et al., 2004, 2008; Jupp et al.,\n2010). The annual CO2, precipitation and temperature\ncomponents of the model drivers are shown in Fig. 1.\nResults and Discussion\nImpact of parameter variation on ecosystem biomass\nresponses to climate change\nAltering the five demographic parameters that control\nunconstrained spatially mediated demographic processes\nhad a profound influence on the predicted response of eco-\nsystem biomass to future CO2 and climate (Fig. 2a).\nBiomass estimates in 2005 ranged from 6.6 to\n22.1 kg C m)2 yr)1. By 2050, the competing effects of\nincreasing mortality and productivity in the future scenarios\ncreate an even wider divergence in biomass (3.25\u2013\n27.0 kg C m)2 yr)1). Some ensemble members are able to\nbenefit from CO2 fertilization, while others are more rap-\nidly affected by the increasingly severe drought events\n(Fig. 1). Between 2059 and 2060, there is a large drought\nevent that depletes the carbon store and causes mortality in\neven the most conservative plant functional types. By 2100,\nplant biomass is heavily depleted in most scenarios, with the\nmost resilient scenario supporting 9.6 kg C m)2. The\nresponse of LAI to changing climate and CO2 is both less\nextreme and differs less between runs as LAI recovers more\nquickly after disturbance and is therefore less affected by\nvariations in ecosystem demography. We emphasize that,\nowing to the random selection of baseline climate, this illus-\ntration is not meant to be proscriptive of the actual future\nclimate or vegetation in particular years.\nFiltering unrealistic ensemble members\nThe parameter space exploration generated wide variation\nin ecosystem properties for the present day (Fig. 2a); how-\never, many of the ensemble members generated unrealistic\npredictions for ecosystem properties that can be constrained\nby current observations. We filtered those ensemble mem-\nbers whose biomass, GPP, NPP or LAI fell outside observed\nranges (Malhi et al., 2009b; Fisher et al., 2007; Brando\net al., 2008). To account for measurement error in the\nupper and lower boundaries of the observations, we\nextended the ranges by 10% on either side. After the filtering\nprocess, 14 ensemble members remained whose estimates\nof all four variables were inside the observed ranges\n(Fig. 2b). While there are many fewer simulations in the fil-\ntered set, the spread of predictions is not substantially\nreduced, with biomass in year 2050 still ranging from 2.6\nto 27.0 kg C m)2 yr)1. Filtering with this particular set of\nmodel metrics did not allow us to constrain the different\nmodel futures or rule out either the extremely sensitive or\nextremely resistant scenarios. Therefore, satisfactory approx-\nimation of contemporary ecosystem observations is not\nnecessarily an indicator that a model will produce accurate\nfuture predictions. Current efforts to \u2018benchmark\u2019 vegeta-\ntion models with sets of basic ecosystem data, with the\nintention of constraining the range of future predictions,\nshould consider this possibility when interpreting their\nresults (Randerson et al., 2009). It is possible that addi-\ntional filters not used in this experiment, notably responses\nof forest to experimental drying (Fisher et al., 2007; Brando\net al., 2008) might provide more appropriate filtering data.\nThese kinds of plot-level observations are not yet considered\nin DGVM benchmarking exercises, however, owing to the\ndifficulties involved in precisely replicating the experimental\nconditions in DGVM models.\nCommunity structure and its relation to ecosystem\nbiomass predictions\nFig. 3 illustrates the different plant community structures\nfound in the 14 runs that met the filtering criteria. The panels\nare ordered according to their predicted ecosystem bio-\nmass in 2050 (from low to high). Those runs where forest\nmortality events were predicted to occur sooner, and bio-\nmass in 2050 was consequentially lower (e.g. Fig. 3 \u2013 top\nFig. 1 Forcing data for model simulations: (a) carbon dioxide\nconcentrations, (b) temperature and (c) annual precipitation.\n672 Research\nNew\nPhytologist\n\u0002 The Authors (2010)\nJournal compilation \u0002 New Phytologist Trust (2010)\nNew Phytologist (2010) 187: 666\u2013681\nwww.newphytologist.com\ntwo rows), were dominated by the fast-growing PFT 1\n(filled circles), while those runs where the ecosystem\navoided biomass collapse for longer tended to have a more\nequitable distribution of PFTs (e.g. Fig. 3 \u2013 bottom two\nrows). In this particular model scenario, prevailing condi-\ntions before 2000 typically favour the dominance of the\nfastest-growing plant types. The persistence of PFT1 as the\ndominant plant type in 2000 reflects the relatively benign\nclimatic conditions over the last century and is consistent\nwith a small fitness cost associated with low rates of carbon\nstorage: NPP rarely falls sufficiently to deplete stored carbon\nreserves enough cause canopy tree mortality. In all cases, the\nfastest-growing PFTs gain a slight initial advantage via\nlower allocation to carbon storage. The eventual community\nstructure, however, depends upon the strength of processes\nthat reinforce this initial dominance, which is affected sub-\nstantially by varying the spatially mediated parameters in\nthis sensitivity test.\nImpact of individual parameters on community\nstructure and ecosystem properties\nIllustrating detailed ecosystem composition for every\nensemble member was impractical, so we reduced the\ndimensionality of the output by calculating a PFT range.\nRp, for each model run, as\nRp \u00bc Bf ;1 \u0002 Bf ;7 Eqn 11\nwhere Bf,i is the fractional biomass of the ith PFT in 2000.\nFractional biomass is the total of the total biomass\naccounted for by a given PFT. Values close to 1 indicate\ndominance the fastest-growing PFT and values close to zero\nindicate more equitable PFT distribution. This metric of\ncommunity structure provides a single value with which to\nrepresent how much the community is dominated by fast-\ngrowing plants.

Ecosystem biomass was greatest\nfor mid-range community composition. Those ensemble\nmembers with highly equitable PFT distribution tended to\nhave very low biomass, below the acceptable range.\nFigs 5\u20137 illustrate how the five demographic parameters\nthat we investigated were related to PFT range index\n(Eqn 10, Fig. 5), biomass predictions at 2050 (Fig. 6) and\nLAI in 2005 (Fig. 7). The impact of the different para-\nmeters on NPP, GPP and biomass in 2005 and biomass in\n2100 are illustrated in Figs S1\u2013S4.\nOf the five parameters varied, sapling mortality (Ms)\nhad the greatest impact on community structure and eco-\nsystem properties.

Low values of Ms\nencourage this positive feedback, leading to monodomi-\nnance and high PFT range. Simulations with high values\nof Ms suppress this feedback and tended to have a more\nequitable PFT distribution with more slow-growing PFTs\n(Fig. 5d). These PFTs are less susceptible to drought\ninduced mortality (in the model), so the runs with high\nMs have higher biomass in 2050 (Fig. 6d). In addition, a\ncombination of higher allocation to storage, and less to\nleaves, as well as lower overall understorey recruitment\nrates, means that those communities with high values\nof Ms have lower estimates of LAI (Fig. 7d). The first\norder impact of lower sapling mortality on biomass\n(more seeds = more biomass) was not present in 2005\n(Fig. S3d).\nThe seed mixing parameter (Xm) had a large impact on\ncommunity structure. Initial seeding conditions are an\nimportant control on community structure after canopy\nclosure. When large numbers of seeds are distributed to\nother patches, and Xm is high, PFT1 dominance of one age\nclass makes it a source of PFT1 seed for other age-classes,\nincreasing its share of the seed bank and thus its increasing\nability to dominate newly disturbed areas. Where most\nseeds land in their parent patch, and Xm is low, PFT1 wastes\nmost of its seed increasing competition with itself.\nTherefore, high Xm promotes both dominance of PFT1\n(Fig. 5c) and the development of communities with fast-\ngrowing PFTs. These fast-growing PFTs are at greater risk\nof dying under future droughted conditions because of their\nlower carbon reserves, so forest biomass in 2050 is lower for\nhigh Xm simulations (Fig. 6c). However, higher Xm allows\nfaster colonization of recently disturbed gaps, facilitating\nfaster regeneration and higher spatially averaged LAI\n(Fig. 7c).\nSeed advection (As) has a relatively minor impact on\ncommunity structure and on biomass in 2050 (Fig 5e,\n6e). Increasing seed rain modulates the dominance of\nthe fast-growing PFT for sapling recruitment, but also\naccelerates the rate of canopy closure, enhancing the\ndominance of the faster-growing plants (results not\nshown). The conflicting impact of these two mechanisms\nmay well prevent any consistent response from emerging.\nAs did have a notable impact on the biomass in 2100\n(Fig. S2e), as higher seed rain presumably promotes a\nmore rapid ecosystem recovery from mortality events\n(Fig. 7e). Higher seed advection also promotes higher\nLAI; the number of saplings present in the understorey\nincreases on account of the shift in the equilibrium\nbetween recruitment and mortality.\n0 0.5 1\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nCe\nPF\nT \nra\nng\ne\n(a)\n0 0.5 1\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nSm\nPF\nT \nra\nng\ne\n(b)\n0 0.5 1\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nXm\nPF\nT \nra\nng\ne\n(c)\n0.95 0.96 0.97 0.98 0.99\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nMs\nPF\nT \nra\nng\ne\n(d)\n10 20 30 40\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nAs\nPF\nT \nra\nng\ne\n(e)\nFig. 5 Response of modelled plant functional type (PFT) range in 2005 to variation in (a) competitive exclusion, Ce, (b) stress-induced adult\nmortality, Sm, (c) seed mixing, Xm, (d) sapling mortality, Ms, and (e) seed advection, As.

In isolation,\nthese parameters can exert substantial control over community\nstructure (results not shown), but in the global sensitivity\nanalysis (i.e. varying all parameters simultaneously) their\nimpact may well have been overridden by large variations\nin the forcing caused by the other parameters. The LAI\nis highest for low values of Sm, as greater mortality rates of\ncarbon-starved plants in shade or drought results in a lower\nequilibrium LAI (Fig. 7b).\nScale limitations and parameter constraints\nTypically, vegetation modellers attempt to constrain model\nparameter values via observations of the processes to which\nthey apply. Unfortunately, the parameters we investigated\nhere are not amenable to observation because the scales at\nwhich they operate are not represented in the spatially one-\ndimensional model environment. For example, the rate of\nseed advection As of a given PFT is likely a function of (at\nleast) the mean distance in space to other areas of land con-\ntaining that PFT. Landscape models that include a two-\ndimensional spatial structure of interconnected patches,\nwith a representation of both spatial arrangement and dis-\ntance between patches, can simulate this property, but not\none-dimensional DGVM models (Neilson et al., 2005;\nLischke et al., 2006).\nSimilar issues apply to the other three parameters. Seed\nmixing, Xm, most obviously, is the result of the unknown\nlength scale of disturbance processes and patches of land\nthat ED represents via statistical aggregation. The length\nscale of ecosystem patches in reality is controlled by the size\nof disturbance events. If most disturbance events result from\nthe death of single trees, this generates a matrix with a small\nlength scale and a consequentially high rate of inter-age class\nseed mixing. If mortality is spatially aggregated because of\nblow-down events, pathogen outbreaks or fires, then the\nlength scale will be larger and mixing less likely. No\nDGVM at present tracks the two-dimensional sub-grid\nvariation in disturbance history. Tracking disturbance\nhistory is only made computationally possible in the ED\nmodel by removing the spatial dimension and tracking all\npatches of a common disturbance history together. This\nproperty must therefore at present be parameterized. Here\nwe illustrate, for the first time in the context of a DGVM\nmodelling study, how the values of this property affect\nmodel outcome. Future studies must focus on resolving this\nissue either using top-down observational constraints, by\nleveraging output from spatially explicit studies into the\none-dimensional model or by converting the model frame-\nwork to a substantially more computationally intensive\nfine-mesh structure.\n0 0.5 1\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nCe\nB\nio\nm\nas\ns \n(kg\n C\n m\n\u2013\n2 )\n(a)\n0 0.5 1\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nSm\nB\nio\nm\nas\ns \n(kg\n C\n m\n\u2013\n2 )\n(b)\n0 0.5 1\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nXm\nB\nio\nm\nas\ns \n(kg\n C\n m\n\u2013\n2 )\n(c)\n0.96 0.97 0.98 0.99\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nMs\nB\nio\nm\nas\ns \n(kg\n C\n m\n\u2013\n2 )\n(d)\n10 20 30 40\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nAs\nB\nio\nm\nas\ns \n(kg\n C\n m\n\u2013\n2 )\n(e)\nFig. 6 Response of predicted biomass in 2050 to variation in (a) competitive exclusion, Ce, (b) stress-induced mortality, Sm, (c) seed mixing,\nXm, (d) sapling mortality, Ms, and (e) seed advection, As.

It might be possible to\nestimate locally appropriate values of Ce from community\ncomposition data using inverse Bayesian methods (Clark\net al., 2003; Etienne & Olff, 2005).\nSapling mortality,Ms, which is an aggregate of seed num-\nber, seed germination, and death of the germinated seedlings,\nis poorly understood and very complex to model mechanisti-\ncally. Inverse estimates of seed mortality from forest inventories\nmight be possible, but existing forest databases typically only\nmeasure trees > 10 cm diameter (Baker et al., 2004). Thus,\nestimates of Ms are confounded with unobserved\nunderstorey growth and mortality processes. Also, sapling\nmortality is thought to be influenced by dispersal distance\nvia the influence of species-specific herbivores or pathogens\n(Janzen, 1970; Connell, 1971) and by potential positive\ninteractions between parent trees and saplings, the interac-\ntive consequences of which are explored byMurrell (2009).\nStress-induced mortality rates (Sm) appropriate for land-\nscape-scale models or DGVMs are also difficult to para-\nmeterize. Allen et al. (2010) illustrate the difficulty of\nquantifying rates of vegetation mortality with observations\nmade at multiple spatial scales. High rates of observed\nstand-level mortality typically translate into much lower\nlandscape-level mortality rates, owing to spatial variation in\nlandscape properties, biotic agents, species and weather\n(Allen et al., 2010). For a DGVM models, that scale\nlinearly from plot-level simulations to landscape-level\nprediction, the appropriate scale of measurement of plant\nmortality rates is therefore contentious. Landscape-level\nestimates of tree mortality are very rare (Allen et al., 2010)\nbut may be facilitated by vegetation monitoring networks\n(Phillips et al., 2009) in the future.\nSpatial interactions in existing studies\nThe concept that spatial interactions are important for com-\nmunity structure is not novel (Silvertown & Law, 1987)\nbut is infrequently considered by the DGVM community\n(Neilson et al., 2005; Midgley et al., 2007).

Literature from\nforest gap models discusses possible conditions necessary for\nsimulating coexistence and the impact of competitive exclu-\nsion and spatial processes on community structure (Adams\net al., 2007; Lischke & Lo\u00a8ffler, 2006; Kohyama & Takada,\n2009) but the emerging literature on second-generation\nDGVMs provides little discussion on how plant coexistence\nis generated along axes of variation other than early-to-late\nsuccessional plant traits. A vast literature on the assemblage\nof communities, biodiversity and species coexistence can\npotentially inform us on how best to proceed from this\npoint (McGill et al., 2006), and it seems likely that the pos-\nsible limits on these parameters may potentially be\ninformed by the outcomes of more spatially explicit models\nat various scales (Kneitel & Chase, 2004).\nConclusion\nIn this paper we introduce a series of modifications to the\nED model that more readily allow the coexistence of plant\ntypes with similar growth rates. We conclude that, despite\nmajor advances in dynamic global vegetation modelling,\nthere exist a number of processes pertaining to spatial plant\necology that are currently beyond the capacity of even\nthe most sophisticated DGVMs to capture. If we fail to\nappropriately represent or constrain the processes that con-\ntrol the emergence of plant community structure in the new\ngeneration of global vegetation models, we risk generating\nmodelled communities of plants with erroneous responses\nto climatic and atmospheric changes.\nWhile we have endeavoured to create simulations that\nclosely reflect the behaviour of Amazonian rainforest eco-\nsystems, we emphasize that our purpose was not to provide\ndefinitive predictions of the future of the Amazon, but\ninstead to illustrate the potential importance of the repre-\nsentation of infrequently discussed plant demographic\nprocesses of reproduction, competition and mortality on\nthe range of future predictions. We chose to focus on\none location to allow a detailed illustration of this high-\ndimension problem; however, it seems likely that the issues\nderived here may well be generically applicable, in different\nmodelling frameworks, and across multiple combinations\nof climate and functional trade-off axes.\nAcknowledgements\nFunding was provided by the UK Natural Environment\nResearch Council QUEST \u2018Quantifying Ecosystem\u2019s Role\nin the Carbon Cycle\u2019 project (QUERCC), the LANL \u2044\nLDRD program and DOE Office of Science (BER)\nProgram for Ecosystem Research.
