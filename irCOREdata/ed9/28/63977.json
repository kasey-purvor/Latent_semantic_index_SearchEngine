Despite this, there have been no studies that have repeatedly monitored 5 \nindividual vole growth over time from all phases of a density cycle, in order to evaluate 6 \nwhether such variation in body size is due to differences in juvenile growth rates, differences 7 \nin growth periods, or differential survival of particularly large or small voles. This study 8 \ncompares growth trajectories from voles during the peak, increase and crash phases of the 9 \ncycle in order to evaluate whether voles are exhibiting fast or slow-growth strategies. We 10 \nfound that although voles reach highest asymptotic weights in the peak phase and lowest 11 \nasymptotes during the crash, initial growth rates were not significantly different. This 12 \nsuggests that voles attain larger body size during the peak phase as a result of growing for 13 \nlonger.   14 \n 15 \nKeywords: Chitty effect; juvenile growth; multi-annual density cycles; rodent; body size. 16 \n 17 \n18 \n 3 \nIntroduction 1 \nWithin populations of mammals, body size is often correlated with biologically 2 \nsignificant processes such as survival and reproduction, with larger individuals better able to 3 \ncompete for resources and having higher reproductive output (Cuthill and Houston 1997; 4 \nBlanckenhorn 2000; Gaillard et al. 2000). However, there is evidence from a wide range of 5 \ntaxa suggesting that animals exhibit submaximal growth rates, and that this strategy may be 6 \nselectively advantageous depending on the individual\u201fs internal state and the environmental 7 \nconditions encountered (Arendt 1997; Case 1978; Nylin and Gottard 1998; Blanckenhorn 8 \n2000). Life-history theory predicts that faster growth rates incur a cost, due to there being 9 \ntrade-offs in the allocation of resources between growth and other requirements, such as 10 \nsomatic development, immune responses, reproduction and survival against predation (Arendt 11 \n1997; Mangel and Stamps 2001; Blanckenhorn 2000; Lima 1998). Therefore, within a 12 \npopulation, mixed strategies of growth and reproduction may exist (see, for example, Fleming 13 \n1996; Koseki and Maekawa 2000).  14 \nMicrotine rodents are multivoltine, live in a highly seasonal environment, and have 15 \nflexible growth strategies. Ecologists have been interested for decades in understanding the 16 \ncauses of cyclic fluctuations in abundance observed in many vole and lemming populations at 17 \nnorthern latitudes. One controversial issue has been the relative contributions of trophic 18 \ninteractions and changes in the quality of individuals to the demographic changes that 19 \nunderpin such cycles (Krebs 1978). It has long been noted that changes in abundance are 20 \naccompanied by changes in characteristics of individuals, including their body weights. 21 \nIndeed, the so-called \u201cChitty effect\u201d (Chitty 1952; sensu Boonstra and Krebs 1979), whereby 22 \nadults in the increasing and high-density phase of the cycle exhibit larger average body mass 23 \n(20-30% heavier) than during the low-phase, is an important feature of cyclic populations 24 \n(Mihok et al. 1985; Chitty 1987; Lidicker and Ostfeld 1991; Norrdahl and Korpim\u00e4ki 2002), 25 \n 4 \nand it has been argued that understanding the Chitty effect is fundamental to explaining 1 \npopulation cycles (Krebs et al. 1978). Such phase related changes in body size are widely 2 \naccepted to be a consequence of variation in environmental conditions, rather than due to 3 \ngenetic differences between individuals (Stenseth 1999; Ergon et al. 2001a; Klemola et al. 4 \n2003; Turchin 2003). Oli (1999) suggests that the observed variation in body size is due to a 5 \nphase-related trade-off in the dynamic allocation of energy between growth and reproduction, 6 \nreproduction being suppressed during the late-increase and peak phases, such that resources 7 \nare allocated to somatic growth (longer continuous growth).  8 \nAlthough phase-related changes in body sizes are well-documented, most studies 9 \ninvestigating variation in body sizes within and between populations in the wild have tended 10 \nto utilise cross-sectional population data (but see Iverson and Turner 1974; Hansson 1995; 11 \nErgon et al. 2001b; Aars and Ims 2002) rather than repeated measurements of individual mass 12 \nthrough time (longitudinal data), and have not investigated all phases of the density cycle. 13 \nHence, such studies cannot address directly the question of whether such changes in body size 14 \narise from variation in juvenile growth rates (as addressed in this study), in growth periods, or 15 \ndue to the differential survival of particularly large or small voles. Understanding how body 16 \nsize variation arises is crucial if we are to understand whether such variation is adaptive to the 17 \nchanging environmental conditions observed through the cycle, or whether voles are 18 \nconstrained to exhibit smaller body sizes.  19 \nThis paper aims to evaluate whether field voles (Microtus agrestis L.) in Kielder 20 \nForest, UK are exhibiting submaximal growth rates, and whether submaximal growth rates 21 \nand asymptotic weights (upper asymptotic size) are linked to particular phases of the multi-22 \nannual cycle. While the multi-annual cycles of density exhibited by voles at Kielder have 23 \nlower  amplitude than cycles found in Fennoscandia owing to higher estimated densities in the 24 \nlow phase (Lambin et al. 2000), clear crashes in population density are observed and are 25 \n 5 \nknown to be associated with the Chitty effect (Ergon et al. 2001a). Further, we test whether 1 \nthe predictions of Oli (1999) regarding a trade-off between growth and reproduction apply not 2 \nonly between years (phases) but also within years (though not specifically considered by Oli). 3 \nWe evaluate whether voles born early in the year (typically reproducing in their year of birth) 4 \nexhibited a short-growing strategy when compared to individuals born late in the year (which 5 \ntypically delay reproduction until the following year). 6 \n 7 \nMethods 8 \nHypotheses tested 9 \nThis analysis aimed to evaluate whether variation in the distribution of asymptotic 10 \nweights in cyclic populations, the Chitty effect, arises from variation in juvenile growth 11 \nstrategies. We first consider between-year variation, and test the main hypothesis that voles 12 \nborn during the peak density years of the cycle exhibit faster growth and reach higher 13 \nasymptotic weights than voles born during the increase phase, as a result of higher initial 14 \ngrowth rates and\/or delayed deceleration in growth, whereas voles born during the crash 15 \nphase reach the lowest asymptotic weights for equivalent reasons. We also test subsidiary 16 \nhypotheses on within-year variation in growth strategies in order to ascertain whether 17 \ndifferences in growth between years of the cycle were not due to variation in population 18 \nstructure. Specifically, we evaluate whether voles from early cohorts exhibit faster (or slower) 19 \ngrowth strategies than late-born voles, whether growth patterns differ between males and 20 \nfemales, and whether differences in the proportions of these sub-groups might account for any 21 \nphase-related differences. 22 \n 23 \nStudy site and trapping methods 24 \n 6 \n The study took place in Kielder Forest (55\no13\u201f N, 2o33\u201f W), a commercial plantation 1 \nforest where field voles exhibit multi-annual cycles (details of study area in Lambin et al. 2 \n2000) with a 3-4 year periodicity, during a longitudinal study undertaken between 2001 and 3 \n2007. Voles were trapped in four similar-sized clear-cuts (referred to as BHP, KCS, PLJ and 4 \nROB), in two areas of the forest approximately 12 km apart, between May 2001 and March 5 \n2007. Population size fluctuated during the study period, reaching peak densities during 2003 6 \nand subsequently crashing to low levels in 2004  (range: 31 voles\/ha (95% CI 23-40) to 746 7 \nvoles\/ha (95% CI 674-817)). Clear seasonal patterns in density fluctuation were overlaid on 8 \nthe multi-annual fluctuations, with summer peaks and over-winter declines in density (Figure 9 \n1). Vole density estimates for each primary session were calculated using Huggins\u201fs closed 10 \ncapture models within a robust design (Kendall and Nichols 1997; Huggins 1989) fitted using 11 \nprogram MARK (White and Burnham 1999) using mixture models (Pledger 2000) to allow 12 \nheterogeneity in capture probabilities.  13 \n Populations were trapped in primary sessions every 28 days from March to November, 14 \nand every 56 days from November to March. Each site had a permanent 0.3ha live-trapping 15 \ngrid consisting of 100 Ugglan Special Mousetraps (Grahnab, Marieholm, Sweden), in optimal 16 \nhabitat dominated by Deschampsia caespitosa Beauv., Agrostis tenuis Sibth., and Juncus 17 \neffusus L. Traps were set at 5m intervals and baited with wheat and carrots. Traps were pre-18 \nbaited with a slice of carrot and a few grams of oats 3 days before each trapping session, set at 19 \napproximately 18:00 on the first day and checked five times (\u201csecondary sessions\u201d) at roughly 20 \n12 hour intervals at dawn and dusk.   21 \n Individual animals were identified using subcutaneous microchip transponders (AVID 22 \nplc, East Sussex, UK) injected into the skin at the back of the neck. Mass (measured to the 23 \nnearest 0.5 gram using a Pesola spring balance), sex and reproductive status were recorded at 24 \nthe time of first capture in each primary session.  25 \n 7 \nData-set analysed 1 \n The average mass of captive born field voles at 2 weeks (approximate age at weaning) 2 \nwas 11.3g (S.E.=0.43, n=18 animals, weighed at age 12-16 days). Examining animals from 3 \nKielder Forest first caught weighing \u226412g, revealed that 99% of these animals weighed 15g or 4 \nmore on second capture (approximately 6 weeks old) (Begon et al. In Press).  Thus in our 5 \nanalyses we only included voles first caught weighing <15g, with voles first caught weighing 6 \n\u226412g assumed to be \u22642 weeks old and voles first caught weighing >12g but less than 15g 7 \nassumed to be between 2 and 6 weeks old. Hence, in the analysis, vole age was defined based 8 \non trapping interval, with age 1 being a \u22642 week old vole, age 1.5 being a 2-6 week old vole, 9 \nage 2 being age 1 plus 4 weeks and so on. In order to confirm that inclusion of voles that may 10 \nhave been slightly older than 14 days at first capture did not bias our conclusions, all analyses 11 \nwere also repeated on data only including voles first caught \u226412g in weight. Throughout, we 12 \nonly investigate growth rates and asymptotic weights of voles during their first 6 months. 13 \nMany voles will undergo sexual maturation over this time span and gestation would add 14 \nunwelcome noise to our data. We thus removed all records of  reproductively active females, 15 \ndefined as those recorded as having a perforate vagina or having been recorded as gestating in 16 \nthe field, as well as any record from the month preceding such a record. In order to confirm 17 \nthat any differences in growth rates observed between phases were not due to differential 18 \nproportions of reproductive females between phases or seasons, the analysis was repeated 19 \nusing data on male voles only.  20 \n Voles were recorded as having been caught in the \u201cpeak\u201d phase of the cycle if they were 21 \nborn during the year of highest recorded density (2003 for all sites, 2002 and 2003 for ROB). 22 \nThe \u201ccrash\u201d year occurred in 2004 and was defined as the year with the lowest recorded vole 23 \ndensities and no significant summer increase in density. The \u201cincrease\u201d phase was defined as 24 \nbeing any year where vole densities increased over the summer following the crash phase 25 \n 8 \n(2001, 2005 and 2006 for all sites; 2002 for all sites except ROB) (see Figure 1). We also 1 \ninvestigated whether present density was a better predictor of vole growth rates than cycle 2 \nphase which largely reflects past density. Voles were subdivided into an \u201cearly\u201d cohort if they 3 \nwere born before the 21\nst\n June, and \u201clate\u201d cohort if they were born on or after the 21st June. 4 \nThe June solstice was selected a-priori as a time-point dividing the breeding season.  5 \n All analyses were undertaken using the statistical software \u201eR\u201f (R Development Core 6 \nTeam 2007) using the package \u201enlme\u201f (Pinheiro et al. 2007). 7 \n  8 \nSelection of growth curves 9 \nWe analysed growth curves to estimate growth rate, asymptotic weight and the age at 10 \nwhich maximum growth occurs (point of inflection), the latter indicating therefore at what age 11 \nthe juvenile rapid growth phase slows down. Clearly these three parameters of the growth 12 \ncurve are related: for example, an individual exhibiting a fast growth rate for a prolonged time 13 \nwill reach a high asymptotic weight. 14 \nIn order to determine which growth curve best fitted the overall data, three models 15 \nwere fitted to the observed vole weight at age data: Gompertz; von Bertanlanffy; and logistic 16 \n(Pruitt et al. 1979; Ricker 1979; Ricklefs 1983). Parameters in the growth curve equations are 17 \ndefined as follows: wt is the dependent variable (vole mass in g), vole age is the explanatory 18 \nvariable, asym is the upper asymptotic size, r is the growth rate constant, and I is the age at 19 \nthe inflection point (Zullinger et al. 1984). Growth equations are:   20 \nGompertz:   )}(expexp{* Iagerasymwt  21 \nVon Bertalanffy: ])}[exp({ Iagerasymwt  22 \nLogistic:   1])}[exp(1{ Iagerasymwt  23 \nModel fits were assessed by Akaike\u201fs Information Criterion (Akaike 1973). Models with a 24 \ndifference of AIC (\u0394AIC) of less than 2 may be considered similar in their ability to 25 \n 9 \naccount for the data (Sakamoto, Ishiguro & Kitagawa 1986). According to the principal 1 \nof parsimony, if two alternative models had indistinguishable AIC values (\u0394AIC < 2), the 2 \nmodel with fewer parameters was selected. 3 \n 4 \n 5 \nData Analysis  6 \nIn order to test the hypotheses, growth curves, using the best growth model, were 7 \ncompared between different phases of the cycle (peak, increase and crash), between the sexes, 8 \nand between the early and late cohorts, using the likelihood ratio test following Kimura 9 \n(1980). Growth curves were also compared between cycle phases for \u201cearly\u201d voles and \u201clate\u201d 10 \nvoles separately, in order to confirm that any observed differences between phases were not 11 \ndue to variation in seasonal categories. Due to the longitudinal nature of the data, individuals 12 \nwere repeatedly sampled over time, potentially leading to pseudo-replication. Hence, model 13 \nfitting was repeated on a randomly generated subset of data, utilising one data point per vole. 14 \nModel fitting was also repeated on a data set excluding the top 2.5% of outlying residual 15 \nvalues in order to confirm that the observed patterns were not driven by a small number of 16 \nparticularly fast growing voles.  17 \n 18 \nResults 19 \nFifty-five juvenile voles (138 weights) met our criteria during the \u201ccrash\u201d phase, 234 20 \n(721 weights) during the \u201cincrease\u201d and 239 voles (697 weights) during the \u201cpeak\u201d phase of 21 \nthe multi-annual cycle. Of the \u201ccrash\u201d voles: 31 were female and 24 were male, and 9 and 46 22 \nwere from the early and late cohorts respectively. Similarly for \u201cincrease\u201d voles: 103 were 23 \nfemale and 131 male, and 40 and 194 were from the early and late cohorts, while 105 of the 24 \n 10 \n\u201cpeak\u201d voles were female and 134 male; and 97 were from the early cohort and 142 from the 1 \nlate cohort. 2 \nField voles first caught when 2 weeks old or younger exhibited wide variation in 3 \ngrowth trajectories (Figure 2). The logistic growth model was the best descriptor of growth 4 \n(\u0394AIC 30.63 for Gompertz; and \u0394AIC 67.11 for Bertalanffy when compared to the Logistic 5 \nmodel) and was thus used in all subsequent analyses. Male and female voles had significantly 6 \ndifferent logistic growth curves (Table 1,  AIC: 55.51). Males reached a significantly greater 7 \nestimated asymptotic weight (21.50g \u00b10.15g for males; 20.11g \u00b10.14g for females) and 8 \ndecelerated more slowly (estimated deceleration point for males is at age 1.16 \u00b10.02 9 \ncompared to 1.02 \u00b10.02 for females), but there was no significant difference in initial growth 10 \nrates (0.50g\/28 days \u00b10.02 for males and 0.48 g\/28 days\u00b10.02 for females).  11 \nVoles from \u201eearly\u201f annual cohorts exhibited different growth strategies from voles 12 \nfrom late cohorts (after 21\nst\n June) ( AIC: 43.10; Table 2; Figure 3). There were significant 13 \ndifferences in the asymptotic weight reached, with early cohort voles reaching higher weights 14 \nthan late voles (21.75g \u00b10.22g for early; 20.59g \u00b10.12g for late), and growth rate decelerating 15 \nat a younger age in late cohort voles (age 1.16 \u00b10.02 vs 1.07 \u00b10.01 for late), but there was no 16 \nsignificant difference in initial growth rates (0.46g\/28 days \u00b10.03 for early and 0.52\/28 days 17 \n\u00b10.02 for late) (Table 2).  18 \nThere was no evidence that estimated vole mass at first capture (weaning) varied 19 \nbetween the different phases of the cycle (mean weight at age 1: 9.67 (n=33) for \u201ccrash\u201d; 9.94 20 \n(n=125) for \u201cincrease\u201d; 9.92 (n=144) for \u201cpeak\u201d; F2,299 =0.48, p =0.62). However, growth 21 \ncurves were significantly different between the cycle phases (Table 3; AIC= 95.34; Figure 22 \n4). There were significant differences in the asymptotic weight reached, with peak phase voles 23 \nreaching a weight of 21.79 \u00b10.16g, compared to 20.14 \u00b10.17g for increase phase voles, and 24 \n19.82 \u00b10.50g for crash phase voles. Growth rates of voles during the peak phase decelerated 25 \n 11 \nat a later age category (1.14 \u00b10.02) than increase or crash voles (1.05 \u00b10.02), but there was no 1 \nsignificant difference in initial growth rates between the phases (crash growth rate 0.46 2 \n\u00b10.06g\/28 days; increase 0.51\u00b10.03g\/28 days; peak 0.49 \u00b10.02g\/28 days). 3 \nAnalyses of the hypothesis that growth curves were significantly different between 4 \nphases ( AIC between the coincident model and the best model where the asymptotic weights 5 \nand age at inflection differed but growth rate was constant) was robust to the exclusion of 6 \nindividuals who contributed one or more outlier observations (remaining data n=499 7 \nindividuals; n=1472 weights; AIC: 93.84); when undertaken on a dataset only comprising 8 \nindividuals first caught \u226412g in weight (n=302 individuals; n=910 weights; AIC: 24.49); and 9 \nwhen model fitting was repeated on a randomly generated subset of data, utilising one data 10 \npoint per vole (n=528 weights; AIC: 21.58). Moreover, the pattern and significance of the 11 \ndifferences between the growth curves for the crash, increase and peak phases remained when 12 \nlate and early cohort voles were analysed separately (Early voles: n= 146 individuals, n= 392 13 \nweights, AIC 10.49; Late voles: n= 382 individuals, n= 1164 weights, AIC 63.60) and 14 \nwhen males and females were analysed separately (Males: n= 289 individuals, n= 822 15 \nweights, AIC 47.50; Females: n= 239 individuals, n= 734 weights, AIC 48.65). Parameter 16 \nestimates were very similar to those when the sexes and the cohorts were analysed together. 17 \nVole density was not a better predictor of vole growth rates than cycle phase. Voles 18 \nfrom low, medium and high densities (based on the range of densities divided into three 19 \ncategories) differed significantly (\u2206AIC= 5.84 when compared to the coincident model), with 20 \nvoles born during months of high density reaching significantly higher asymptotic weights 21 \nthan those from low or medium density. There was, though, no support for a model with 22 \ndifferent growth trajectories for voles born in years with low, medium or high densities in the 23 \nspring (March\/April) of the year of birth (\u2206AIC= 1.63). Overall, phase was a better predictor 24 \n 12 \nof growth rates than density (\u2206AIC= 35.04 for current density; and \u2206AIC= 14.04 for spring 1 \ndensity when compared to the best phase model). 2 \n 3 \nDiscussion 4 \nThe most striking finding of this analysis of growth trajectories in field voles during a 5 \npopulation cycle is that initial growth rates were remarkably consistent between phases of the 6 \ncycle, and between sexes and the season of birth (early or late). However, there is strong 7 \nevidence that the age at which growth rates decelerate, and also the asymptotic weights 8 \nreached, vary between cycle phases. The main aim of this paper was to evaluate whether the 9 \n\u201eChitty Effect\u201f, whereby adults in the high-density phase of the cycle exhibited larger average 10 \nbody mass than during the low-phase of the cycle, could be explained by variation in juvenile 11 \ngrowth rates in the different cycle phases. The Chitty effect is clearly present in Kielder voles, 12 \nalbeit at a lower magnitude than the 20-30% reported in previous studies (Mihok et al. 1985; 13 \nChitty 1987; Lidicker and Ostfeld 1991; Norrdahl and Korpim\u00e4ki 2002), with the difference 14 \nbetween the asymptotic weights of voles observed during the crash\/increase phase and 15 \nbetween those during the peak being 1.84g (representing 8.8% of the total body weight of an 16 \naverage vole). However, this difference was not due to voles exhibiting faster growth rates, 17 \nbut rather to voles growing for longer.  18 \nThese differences in the length of the juvenile growth period between voles during the 19 \npeak phase and those during the increase and crash phase were not due to differences in 20 \npopulation structure between phases. Separate analysis of males and females, and of early 21 \ncohort and late cohort voles, found that the pattern and significance of the differences between 22 \nthe growth curves for the phases remained robust. 23 \nIt should be noted that due to lower numbers of voles being observed during the crash 24 \nperiod, there was only limited power to detect significant differences in initial growth rates 25 \n 13 \nduring this phase, and such differences cannot therefore be ruled out altogether. Also, further 1 \nlaboratory work would be necessary to evaluate whether this (apparently consistent) growth 2 \nrate represents a physiological maximum. Nonetheless, the present results do not support the 3 \nhypothesis that individuals exhibit sub-maximal juvenile growth rates during certain phases of 4 \nthe cycle due to variable environmental conditions.  5 \nAlthough the Chitty effect has received much attention, there is relatively little 6 \nevidence evaluating its relevance to broader life-history theory and predicting trade-offs 7 \nbetween growth strategies and other biologically significant processes in multivoltine 8 \norganisms (Stenseth and Ims 1993; however see Lambin and Yoccoz 2001). Reproduction, 9 \nparticularly sexual maturation of juveniles, is known to be inhibited during times of high 10 \npopulation density in cyclic Microtus rodents (Boonstra 1989; Boyce and Boyce 1988; 11 \nMyllym\u00e4ki 1977; Ostfeld et al. 1993). Suppression of reproduction may arise due to limited 12 \navailability or poor quality of food resources; due to suppression by dominant individuals or 13 \nby puberty-delaying hormones secreted by littermates; and by pre- or post-natal stress (see Oli 14 \n1999 for a more detailed review). It has been suggested that the Chitty effect is a 15 \nconsequence, not a cause, of cyclic population fluctuations, and of phase-related changes in 16 \ndemographic processes, especially the age at first reproduction (Oli 1999; Lidicker and 17 \nOstfeld 1991).  18 \nOli (1999), in particular, hypothesised that the Chitty effect was due to a trade-off 19 \nbetween reproductive effort and somatic growth, in which individuals born during peak 20 \ndensities, especially those in the earlier cohorts, would suppress reproduction and thus have 21 \nenergy and resources available to allow them to grow for a longer period of time and reach a 22 \nhigher body mass, compared to those born in the low or early increase phase. Our finding that 23 \nthe Chitty effect is not due to differences in growth rates, but rather to differences in the 24 \nlength of growth periods, and that this applies to the earlier cohorts, directly supports this 25 \n 14 \nhypothesis. Further empirical work is now necessary to evaluate the further consequences of 1 \nthis, and in particular whether there is also differential survival of the different size classes.  2 \nFinally, it is interesting to note that the contrast between those born early in the year 3 \n(active reproduction, prolonged growth) and those born later (delayed reproduction, fore-4 \nshortened growth) does not support the idea of a trade-off. Neither, though, do the results 5 \nsupport the idea that early-cohort voles grow rapidly (as opposed to growing for longer) in 6 \norder to arrive sooner at a weight that permits reproduction. This in turn suggests that those 7 \nborn later in the year either have fewer total metabolic resources available to allocate to 8 \ndifferent vital processes, or that they divert resources freed up by delayed reproduction to 9 \nsomething other than prolonged growth.   10 \n 11 \nAcknowledgements 12 \nThis work was funded by the Natural Environmental Research Council (Studentship number 13 \nNER\/S\/A\/2000\/03445 awarded to S.
