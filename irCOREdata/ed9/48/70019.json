People are influenced by those\nthey talk to \u2013 so that if the majority of a person\u2019s social contacts favour one\npolitical position and\/or party that person is more likely than otherwise to favour\nit also, even if her\/his personal characteristics suggest a predisposition to favour\nanother position\/party5\u2013 according to Miller, \u2018people who talk together vote\ntogether\u2019.6 There is an assumed \u2018conversion by conversation\u2019 process, by which,\nbecause of ecological processes, majority positions in communities become\nmore dominant than predicted by models based on the individual voters\u2019\ncharacteristics alone. Recent studies of the links between conversations and\nvoting are consistent with this assumption, except that they are unable to test\nwhether the conversations involve near-neighbours.7 There is strong circum-\nstantial evidence of the existence of a neighbourhood effect \u2013 but no more \u2013 and\nauthors who have promoted the hypothesis recognize that alternative explana-\ntions can be provided for the effect without calling on local social interaction\nas a (the major?) causal mechanism involved.\nMost studies of the neighbourhood effect use ecological data, and so provide\nonly circumstantial evidence of its existence. One of the most sophisticated\nof these studies \u2013 which has had much less impact than it should \u2013 was\nreported more than two decades ago.8 Miller set out to test the assertion\nthat \u2018contact is a condition for interaction\u2019, from which, if neighbourhood\neffects operate, it might then be assumed that \u2018contact is a condition for\n4 For a review of the seminal literature, see P.

If there were no\nenvironmental effect operating, then the slope coefficient should be the same\nin each model. But it was not; models designed to identify the relative\nimportance of the individual and constituency components found not only that\nthe consensual model described voting behaviour in England at the five general\nelections between 1964 and October 1974 inclusive but also that (a) the\nconstituency component was greater than the individual component in\naccounting for the level of class polarization and (b) the relative importance of\nthe constituency component had increased over time. Further regression\nanalyses suggested that the key ecological variable for the constituency analyses\nwas not a middle-class\/working-class dichotomy but rather the percentage of a\nconstituency\u2019s workforce who were \u2018employers and managers\u2019. These form the\n9 As was claimed in B. Berelson, P. F. Lazarsfeld and W. N. McPhee, Voting (Chicago: University\nof Chicago Press, 1954).\n10 The source of this model is A. Przeworski and G. A. D.

The major determinant of constituency class polarization\nis what we have termed the environmental effect of the local balance of the core\nclasses.\nThis was especially so with the working class: the more members of the \u2018core\nclass\u2019 in a constituency, the greater the Conservative vote by all classes except\nthe core class itself. The reason for this, he asserts, is:\nthe power of the environment to structure social contacts plus the empirical fact (and\nit is only empirical, not logical) that contact across class boundaries makes a\nconsensual impact on partisan choice. Social interaction contributes the major\ncomponent of constituency class polarization \u2026 ultimately it is the degree of\ncontact with core class occupations that is critical for partisan choice.\nIn other words, people who talk together vote together.11\n11 For later work on this theme, see M.

This was the basis for Dunleavy\u2019s critique.12\nHe contended that the empirical evidence supporting the contagion model \u2018has\nnever been significant\u201913 and that its protagonists \u2018have never explained which\ncausal mechanisms affect political alignment, given that voting by secret ballot\nis hardly in the public realm (unlike other aspects of lifestyle), and that political\nalignment is not apparently involved in any extensive way in the social life of\nthe locality (unlike the workplace)\u2019. The status of the explanations offered is\nthus \u2018highly suspect\u2019, he argues, and \u2018we cannot simply assume that political\nalignment brushes off on people by rubbing shoulders in the street, as exponents\nof contagion models invariably seem to imply\u2019.\nAlthough the neighbourhood effect continues to appear in some accounts of\nvoting patterns in Britain it has rarely been put to exhaustive, critical tests. In\nlarge part this is because of the absence of data with which to make such tests\nat spatial scales smaller than that of the constituency, which is much too large\nto act as a surrogate for a neighbourhood community within which interaction\ntakes place. A constituency may have 20 per cent of its workforce employed in\nMiller\u2019s \u2018core class\u2019, for example, but these may all live in one segment of it\nand have no social (even visible) contact at all with members of the other classes\nwho live elsewhere in the constituency. Even if data which meet more rigorous\ncriteria of relevance to studies of the neighbourhood effect are available, there\nis still the need to link empirical observations to plausible mechanisms: first,\nhowever, we need to establish what has rarely been done to date \u2013 that there are\ngeographical variations in voting behaviour by local area that are consistent with\nthe neighbourhood effect hypothesis.\nThe paucity of data at an ecological scale approximating that of a\nneighbourhood community within which social interaction occurs makes it\ndifficult to test Miller\u2019s model. Voting data for general elections are not reported\nat scales below that of the constituency and although census data can be obtained\nfor two other scales \u2013 the enumeration district (average population about 500)\nused in the collection of census data and the local authority electoral ward\n(average population about 5,000) \u2013 ecological studies can only be conducted at\nthe constituency level.14 Two other approaches have been employed to\ncircumvent this problem: procedures such as entropy-maximizing have been\nused to estimate cross-classifications of voting and social variables;15 and it is\n12 P.

They have provided clear evidence, despite arguments to the\ncontrary,18 of a geography to voting that cannot be reduced to individual\ncharacteristics: however, it is hard to link that, except in the most indirect way,\nto the neighbourhood effect.\nMiller\u2019s models remain very largely untested, therefore, and the neighbour-\nhood effect is at best a hypothesis supported by circumstantial evidence. This\narticle reports research whose findings strengthen that circumstantial evidence,\nusing 1997 BES data organized at spatial scales that are more relevant to the\nassumed social interaction processes in residential communities than has been\nundertaken heretofore.\nBUILDING \u2018BESPOKE NEIGHBOURHOODS\u2019\nIt is generally assumed that much, non-work-based, face-to-face social\ninteraction takes place in relatively restricted areas around each individual\u2019s\nhome, because of constraints on travelling. If face-to-face interaction is crucial\nto the operation of interclass neighbourhood effects, whether in formal or\ninformal interaction settings, therefore, we need to look at small areas\ncontaining a few hundred or thousand residents at most \u2013 not entire\nconstituencies. Electoral wards may fit this requirement but they vary\nsubstantially in their size, being generally much larger in metropolitan than in\nurban and rural areas. (In England in 1991 the average ward in Metropolitan\nCounties contained 10,231 electors, compared to 3,229 in non-Metropolitan\nrural areas.) Some wards may be not only socially heterogeneous (like most\n(F\u2019note continued)\nhas the potential for expanding this area of work in a variety of ways (G. King, A Solution to the\nEcological Inference Problem: Reconstructing Individual Behavior from Aggregate Data (Princeton,\nNJ: Princeton University Press, 1997)).\n16 Warde et al., \u2018Class, Consumption and Voting\u2019, analysed voting patterns in local government\nelections at the ward scale, but low turnout makes for difficulties, especially as there is usually\ndifferential turnout between the supporters of the main political parties.\n17 M.

These may be ideal\nsurrogates for local communities for many people, but they may be too small:\nin addition, because some of the census data are coded and made available for\na 10 per cent sample only, the data for them may be unrepresentative and\nunreliable. What we have done, therefore, is use the enumeration districts as\nbuilding blocks for the creation of \u2018bespoke neighbourhoods\u2019. With the\nassistance of the CREST team who undertook the 1997 BES, we were able\n(without in any way jeopardizing the confidentiality guaranteed to respondents)\nto identify each respondent\u2019s post-code and enumeration district.19 We then\nemployed a customized algorithm designed to identify the group of districts\ncontaining the nearest n persons to the respondent\u2019s home \u2013 where n can be any\nnumber greater than 500.20 We used five definitions of n, and built bespoke\nneighbourhoods for every 1997 BES respondent containing their nearest 500,\n1,000, 2,500, 5,000 and 10,000 neighbours. Once these had been defined, we\nthen obtained the relevant census data for the groups of enumeration districts\nwhich formed those neighbourhoods: only then were those data combined with\nthe individual-level data.\nWe thus have census data with which an area\u2019s characteristics can be\ndescribed, at eight scales: nearest enumeration district (nED); nearest 500\npersons (n500); nearest 1,000 persons (n1000); nearest 2,500 persons (n2500);\nnearest 5,000 persons (n5000); nearest 10,000 persons (n10000); electoral ward;\nparliamentary constituency.

This was because the\nfrequency distributions were either highly skewed or were multi-modal. Instead,\nwe employed a synthetic index, based on varimax-rotated principal components\nanalyses of a number of variables.

These provide the neighbourhood contexts for testing Miller\u2019s models.\nCLASS POLARIZATION AND NEIGHBOURHOOD POLARIZATION\nTable 2 gives the pattern of voting by class in 1997 as revealed by the BES.21\nWhether this indicates the absence of a class cleavage is clearly a matter of\nsubjective interpretation. There are substantial differences between the three\nwhite-collar and two blue-collar classes in their support for the Conservative\nparty, for example, and also, though to a lesser extent, in their support for Labour\nand rates of abstention. Labour won a plurality over the Conservatives in every\nclass except the petty bourgeoisie, though the Labour:Conservative (L:C) ratio\nwas much higher in the two blue-collar (2.80 and 3.62) than in the two\nwhite-collar classes (1.10 and 1.47).\nDo these patterns of support vary spatially within each class? To answer that,\nthe size of the sample allows us to look at only three of the classes: the salariat;\nthe routine non-manual workers; and the working class.\nTABLE 2 The \u2018Class Cleavage\u2019 1997*\nVote\nClass CON LAB LD REF DNV L:C\nSalariat 29 32 8 2 15 1.10\nRoutine non-manual 24 35 13 2 22 1.47\nPetty bourgeoisie 34 26 13 3 22 0.76\nManual foremen etc. 15 42 14 3 25 2.80\nWorking class 13 47 10 2 25 3.62\nKey to vote: CON, Conservative; LAB, Labour; LD, Liberal Democrat; REF,\nReferendum Party; DNV, did not vote.

Regarding support for the Conservatives, with one exception there is a\ncontinuous sequence of declining support from the highest to the lowest status\nareas for each of the three classes at both spatial scales: the Conservatives got\nmost support, within each class, in the highest status neighbourhoods and least\nin the lowest status areas. Countering this, and with three very slight exceptions,\nthere is a similar increase in support for Labour within each class as one moves\nfrom the highest to the lowest status constituencies and wards.\nThe final block of data in Table 3 synthesises the previous two, giving the\nratio of support for the Labour and Conservative parties for each class at each\nstatus level. Again, with just three slight exceptions (levels 3 and 4 for the routine\nnon-manual workers at the ward scale and levels 4 and 5 for the working class\nat both ward and constituency scale) there is an unbroken sequence down each\ncolumn: the lower the area\u2019s status the greater the support for Labour relative\nto that for the Conservatives, in each of the social classes. As expected from the\n\u2018class cleavage\u2019, the Conservatives performed better than Labour among the\nsalariat than the routine non-manual class, and among the latter than the working\nTABLE 3 Vote by Class and Area Status: Constituencies and Wards\nConstituency Ward\nArea status S RN WC S RN WC\nPercentage voting Conservative\n1 (High) 38 40 24 44 43 29\n2 36 29 21 31 32 21\n3 30 27 14 25 21 11\n4 22 18 8 21 26 9\n5 (Low) 17 17 9 16 10 9\nPercentage voting Labour\n1 (High) 19 19 29 19 25 34\n2 29 35 40 29 33 39\n3 38 34 47 31 33 48\n4 39 39 53 41 36 53\n5 (Low) 45 47 53 43 49 50\nLabour:Conservative ratio\n1 (High) 0.50 0.48 1.21 0.43 0.58 1.17\n2 0.81 1.21 1.90 0.94 1.03 1.86\n3 1.27 1.26 3.36 1.24 1.57 4.36\n4 1.77 2.17 6.63 1.95 1.38 5.89\n5 (Low) 2.65 2.76 5.89 2.69 4.90 5.55\nKey to classes: S, salariat; RN, routine non-manual; WC, working class.\nClass Dealignment and the Neighbourhood Effect 51\nclass, but within each class the lower the status of the area, the better Labour\u2019s\nrelative performance. Indeed Labour out-polled the Conservatives by a ratio of\nat least 2.5:1.0 in each class in the lowest status areas \u2013 rising to about 6.0:1.0\nin the working class.\nThese findings support Miller\u2019s consensual environmental effects model, but\nat spatial scales for which it is difficult to hypothesize a relevant process. It may\nbe that each constituency and ward is an agglomeration of groups of separate\nneighbourhoods within which that effect operates; tests using the bespoke\nneighbourhoods allow us to evaluate the validity of that claim for the first time.\nThe Smaller Scale\nTables 4 and 5 replicate the analyses reported in Table 3, at the smaller spatial\nscales represented by the bespoke neighbourhoods. They provide powerful\ncircumstantial evidence of the operation of neighbourhood effects in these much\nmore localized areas than is afforded by the constituencies and wards employed\nin Table 3.\nFocusing on the Labour:Conservative ratios, the results in Table 4 contain\nonly two slight exceptions to the down-column sequences identified above as\nshowing the operation of neighbourhood effects. Among the salariat, for\nexample, at the n500 scale the ratio for those living in the lowest status areas\nwas some six times larger than it was for their contemporaries living in the high\nstatus areas (i.e., from 0.58 to 3.54): it was 4.5 times larger for the routine\nnon-manual workers, and 3.7 times larger for the working class. Indeed, across\nall three scales the differences in the ratios between the first and fifth quintiles\nare largest among the salariat: their propensity to vote Conservative rather than\nLabour varied much more substantially over the five neighbourhood types than\nwas the case with the other two classes.\nA very similar, though slightly less clear-cut, set of results is reported for the\nlarger bespoke neighbourhoods in Table 5, which has seven slight deviations\nfrom the columnar sequences that characterize all of these results. The\ndifferences between the classes are not as great as in the smaller bespoke\nneighbourhoods but the overall pattern is the same: the lower the status of the\narea, the higher the ratio of support for Labour to that for the Conservatives,\nwithin all three social classes.\nNesting the Scales\nTables 4 and 5 not only provide incontrovertible circumstantial evidence of\nMiller\u2019s consensual environmental effects model operating at the 1997 general\nelection in England and Wales but also indicate that this evidence was very\nstrong at the smallest spatial scales, thus justifying the decision to test the model\nusing the bespoke neighbourhoods approach. The clear implication is that the\nprocess is operating at very local scales within constituencies and wards. To test\nwhether that is indeed the case, in this last section we use a nested design.

This enables us to test directly for differences within\nconstituencies that are socially heterogeneous. Similarly, we have divided the\nn10000 areas into the top three and bottom three quintile groups, and looked at\nvoting by class at the three smallest spatial scales.\nTable 6 presents the full results from the analyses of high status constituencies\n(i.e. those in the top three quintiles). Although there are slightly more deviations\nfrom the \u2018smooth\u2019 sequences down the columns than recorded in Tables 3\u20135,\nonce again the overall pattern is very much in line with the consensual\nenvironmental effects model: the lower the neighbourhood\u2019s status, at all spatial\nscales, the higher the Labour:Conservative ratio, in each of the three social\nclasses \u2013 and at each scale for each class there is a very substantial difference\nin the L:C ratio between the highest and lowest status neighbourhoods. The\nconstituencies are clearly spatially segmented, because there are sufficient\nrespondents in the smaller areas in the bottom two quintiles for viable analyses,\nand they show that within each relatively high-status constituency, the lower the\nstatus of a smaller area (whether a ward or an n5000 or n10000 bespoke\nneighbourhood) the better Labour\u2019s performance relative to that of the\nConservatives.\nTable 7 reports on the other three nested scale analyses, giving the\nLabour:Conservative ratios only (together with those reported in Table 6).\nAgain there are several small exceptions to the expected sequence, but the\ngeneral pattern of ratios is the same: the higher the status of the small area,\nwhatever the status of the larger area within which it is nested, the lower the\nLabour:Conservative ratio, in each of the three social classes \u2013 with in all cases\na very substantial difference between the lowest- and highest-status neighbour-\nhoods. There is one major exception to this, however \u2013 for the highest-status\nsmall areas within the low-status n10000 areas, among the working class only\n(the first row of the final block in Table 7). These have very high\nLabour:Conservative ratios for the highest status areas, suggesting the operation\nin those situations only of Miller\u2019s reactive environmental effects model: where\nmembers of the working class are in a minority in small high-status pockets\nwithin generally low-status areas, they tend to be very strongly pro-Labour.\nPATTERNS AND PROCESSES\nWith that one major exception, which suggests that Miller\u2019s reactive model may\nhave a limited application, these results have provided a consistent story: the\nlower the status of a neighbourhood the greater the likelihood of a person voting\nLabour rather than Conservative in 1997, whatever her or his social class. This\nis exactly in line with the neighbourhood effect as generally conceived and as\nformalized in Miller\u2019s consensual environmental effects model.

Cox noted that the same patterns could result from different\nprocesses, however \u2013 such as neighbourhood self-selection (middle-class\npeople who are inclined to vote Labour are more likely to choose to live in\nlower-status neighbourhoods than their contemporaries whose attitudes are\npro-Conservative) and differential patterns of local campaigning by the political\nparties.22 There is evidence in other studies to support both of these arguments\nas providing at least a partial account for the patterns described here \u2013 but if they\nwere to offer a full account this would imply either or both of very careful\nchoices of where to live (at detailed spatial scales) by the \u2018non-conformists\u2019 and\nvery finely-tuned spatial targeting of campaigns.\nMore generally, Books and Prysby have proposed a theory of contextual\neffects involving four separate potential processes:23 (1) personal observation,\nwhereby individuals are influenced in how they vote by their appreciation of\nevents and situations in their milieux \u2013 as in their interpretations of the state of\nthe local economy, on which Books and Prysby report that very little work has\nbeen done;24 (2) informal interaction, with inter-personal communications\ninfluencing voting behaviour, as in Cox\u2019s formulation;25 (3) organizationally-\nbased interaction, in workplaces, churches, labour unions and a range of other\norganizations, many of which are local in their structure, provide milieux for\nmeeting and discussing political issues with neighbours; and (4) mass media,\nmany of which are locally focused and provide politically-relevant cues about\nevents in voters\u2019 own neighbourhoods.\nOther possible processes can be suggested that are entirely consistent with\nthese patterns. The class categories used here \u2013 and in almost all other ecological\nstudies of voting \u2013 are extremely broad, for example, and there may be\nsubstantial intra-class variations in voting patterns.26 Thus, for example, the\nmembers of the salariat who live in relatively low-status areas may have lower\nincomes than the average for their class, come from less affluent backgrounds\nand have fewer educational qualifications than the members of the salariat who\nlive in higher-status areas: the former may be more likely to vote Labour than\nthe latter, irrespective of where they live.27 Similarly, active trade unionists may\n22 Cox, \u2018The Voting Decision\u2019.\n23 Books and Prysby, Political Behavior and the Local Context.\n24 J.

McAllister, \u2018Social Context and Electoral Behavior\nin Britain\u2019, American Journal of Political Science, 29 (1985), 564\u201386.\n27 To illustrate this, at the constituency scale, the more middle-class the area (i.e. the higher the\npercentage of households headed by a person in socio-economic groups 1\u20135) the lower the percentage\nwho are in the \u2018lowest\u2019 middle-class group (i.e. SEG 5): Wokingham, for example, has the highest\n58 MACA L L I S T E R A N D O T H E R S\nchoose to live in particular areas where there is a strong Labour presence,\nwhatever their occupational class; their support for Labour will also be\nindependent of their social milieux.\nFurthermore, despite Dunleavy\u2019s claim that political alignment does not\n\u2018simply brush off on people rubbing shoulders in the street\u2019, social interaction\nmay not be necessary for people to become aware of, and adapt to, a local\npolitical culture. This is in line with what Festinger terms \u2018anticipatory\ndissonance reduction\u2019 or \u2018dissonance avoidance\u2019 whereby people seek to reduce\nthe social distance (however defined) between themselves and their neighbours\nin order to be accepted as part of the local culture.28 Political opinions and voting\nbehaviour could form part of this: people recognize that there is a dominant\npolitical culture in their locality and decide to adjust their own perceptions and\nbehaviour to fit in with it \u2013 even if only in their own minds and in the privacy\nof the polling station.\nBooks and Prysby concluded their review of the literature on contextual\neffects by noting that:29\nExisting work in this field frequently lacks empirical investigation of the above\nfactors [assumed to produce contextual effects]. The link between the contextual\nvariables and individual exposure to sources of information often is simply assumed\nto exist \u2026 This lack of empirical investigation into the mechanisms of contextual\neffects is due in large part to the fact that many studies employ secondary analyses\nof survey data collected for other purposes \u2026 Research designed specifically to\nexamine a particular contextual effect \u2026 will be more likely to provide the\nnecessary and appropriate data \u2026 [although] secondary analysis of existing data\nhas its place too, especially as a cost-effective method \u2026\nThat criticism applies to this article too. Our concern has been to establish that\nthere were patterns of voting at the 1997 general election which were entirely\nconsistent with the concept of a neighbourhood effect \u2013 something that the lack\nof relevant data has largely precluded until now. We have provided very strong\nevidence that there is a pattern which needs accounting for, and the literature,\nas indicated here, offers several potential avenues for further investigation of\nthis micro-scale geography of voting.\n(F\u2019note continued)\npercentage in SEGs 1\u20135 (41), of whom only 26 per cent are in SEG5; Birmingham Ladywood, by\ncontrast, has the lowest percentage in SEGs 1\u20135 for England and Wales (8), of whom 45 per cent\nare in SEG5. If those in SEG5 are more likely to vote Labour than those in SEGs 1\u20134, then part of\nthe \u2018neighbourhood effect\u2019 could be accounted for by intra-class geography. The BES data analysed\nhere provide further supporting evidence. Among the salariat, for example, at the n1000 scale, 16.2\nper cent of those living in the highest-status areas (the top quintile) had household incomes below\n\u00a312,000, whereas 26.7 per cent did in the lowest-status areas. Analyses of variance showed that\nneighbourhood was the most significant influence on vote among the salariat, holding income\nconstant, however.\n28 L.

We have\nprovided strong evidence of very significant differences in voting behaviour\nwithin each of the country\u2019s three main social classes at the 1997 general\nelection according to the socio-economic status of the area in which they lived.\nThe lower the area\u2019s status \u2013 at a range of spatial scales including not only the\nconstituency and the ward but also bespoke neighbourhoods varying from\npopulations of 10,000 to less than 500 \u2013 the greater the ratio of Labour:\nConservative voting within each class. Geography clearly does matter.\nBut why? These findings are entirely consistent with Miller\u2019s consensual\nenvironmental effects model, suggesting the operation of classic neighbourhood\neffects. Furthermore, it is difficult to gainsay this inference on the grounds that\nthe spatial scale of the analyses is incommensurate with that at which\nneighbourhood effects are believed to operate. We have identified patterns\nconsistent with neighbourhood effects in small \u2018bespoke neighbourhoods\u2019\nwhose size appears to be in accordance with the assumed residential\ncommunities in which much social interaction occurs. We have not shown that\npeople influence each other\u2019s voting decisions through discussions \u2018over the\ngarden fence\u2019, however. We cannot identify from the available data what\nmechanisms have produced the patterns so clearly displayed in our data. It may\nbe that the classic neighbourhood effect \u2013 conversion by conversation \u2013 is\noperating, but other processes may have produced that outcome. Further\nanalyses are needed to evaluate these ideas \u2013 which call for richer (and probably\nlarger) datasets than those currently available. What the analyses reported here\nhave established, beyond any reasonable doubt, however, is that there was a\nfine-grained spatial patterning to voting behaviour at the 1997 British general\nelection in England and Wales that provides strong evidence for a call to re-open\nthe debate that Miller\u2019s 1978 paper initiated and Dunleavy\u2019s riposte a year later\nmay have prematurely closed.\n"}
