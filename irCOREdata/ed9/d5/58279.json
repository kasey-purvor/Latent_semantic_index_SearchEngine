Geologic mapping, radiometric dating and geochemical analysis 18 \nhave identified six new volcanic units and produced five new 40Ar\/39Ar ages for Cerro Blanco, the northern 19 \nsubcomplex of Nevados de Chill\u00e1n volcano.

Palaeoenvironment reconstructions, 23 \ncombined with 40Ar\/39Ar ages and comparison with the marine oxygen isotope record, show that at least three 24 \nphases of volcanic activity have occurred during the evolution of Cerro Blanco: (1) a constructive, pre-caldera 25 \ncollapse period; (2) a period of caldera formation and collapse; and (3) a constructive period of dome growth 26 \nforming the modern day volcanic centre.  This style of volcanic evolution, whereby large-scale caldera collapse 27 \nis followed by growth of a new stratocone is common at Andean volcanoes. 28 \n 29 \nKeywords: volcano-ice interaction, Nevados de Chill\u00e1n, Cerro Blanco, palaeoenvironment reconstruction, 30 \nsnow-contact, caldera-collapse, 40Ar\/39Ar dating 31 \n 2\n 32 \nIntroduction 33 \nNevados de Chill\u00e1n Volcanic Complex (NCVC) is situated at 36\u00b0S, 71\u00b0W in the Southern Volcanic Zone 34 \n(SVZ) of the Andean cordillera, central Chile.  It is a large stratovolcano composed of two volcanic centres 35 \nsituated 6 km apart along a NNW-SSE trending axis (Fig. 1) (Dixon et al., 1999). 36 \n The two subcomplexes of Nevados de Chill\u00e1n, Cerro Blanco and Las Termas, lie at the NW and SE 37 \nends of the axis, respectively (Fig. 2).  The Las Termas subcomplex is predominantly dacitic, whilst Cerro 38 \nBlanco is predominantly basaltic-andesite to andesite in composition (Dixon et al., 1999).  Volcanic products 39 \ninclude subaerial, subglacial and snow-contact lavas, pyroclastic flow deposits, tephras, lahar deposits and 40 \nscoria cones (Dixon et al., 1999; Mee et al., 2006).  High precision 40Ar\/39Ar and 14C analysis reveals that the 41 \nvolcano has been active since at least 640 ka, with the eruption of the subglacial Los Pincheira lavas, which 42 \nhave an estimated remaining volume of 10 km3 (Dixon et al., 1999). Activity continues to the present day, with 43 \nrecent eruptions occurring during September 2003 from the Las Termas subcomplex (Naranjo and Lara, 2004) 44 \nand then in January 2009 (http:\/\/www.volcanolive.com\/chillan.html). 45 \n Cerro Blanco is composed of several volcanic cones, each with their associated lavas.  The most recent 46 \nof these lavas, the Santa Gertrudis scoria cone and lava, was erupted between 1861 and 1865 (Dixon et al., 47 \n1999; Mee et al., 2006) and dominates the northwestern flank of Cerro Blanco.  To the north and west of Cerro 48 \nBlanco are curved cliff sections interpreted by D\u00e9reulle and D\u00e9reulle (1974) as remnants of two caldera walls 49 \n(Fig. 1).  Although this theory is now generally accepted, evidence is restricted to the morphological structure 50 \nof the cliff scarps, clearly visible in the field and on aerial photographs.  The inner cliff sections are thought to 51 \nrepresent a younger caldera approximately 5 km in diameter, with the outer cliffs suggesting an older caldera of 52 \napproximately 10 km in diameter (Fig. 1).   53 \n Geologic mapping by Dixon et al. in 1999 concentrated on the cone and flanks of the Cerro Blanco 54 \nand Las Termas subcomplexes and the surrounding valleys, with volcanic products being assigned to the 55 \nappropriate subcomplex on the basis of geochemistry.  The highly complex caldera wall areas were thus 56 \ngrouped together as CB1 (the Lanalhue Lavas of Dixon et al., 1999), covering an area of ~ 15 km2.  Since much 57 \nof the area is dominated by steep-sided and scree covered slopes, interpretation of stratigraphic relationships are 58 \nmostly confined to the caldera wall cliffs, hence field mapping for this project was concentrated in these 59 \nlocalities.  Detailed mapping during 12 weeks of fieldwork in 2001 and 2002, have allowed us to identify three 60 \nnew volcanic units along the outer caldera wall (OCW) and upper Santa Gertrudis valley and three new 61 \nvolcanic units along the inner caldera wall (ICW) and these are presented in a new geologic map (Fig. 3).  62 \n 3\nVolcanic facies from each of these units are described in two sections: (1) the outer caldera wall and upper 63 \nSanta Gertrudis valley (SGV) units and facies, and (2) the inner caldera wall units and facies. 64 \n We interpret the palaeoenvironment of emplacement of each of these facies.  These interpretations are 65 \ncombined with geochemical data, 40Ar\/39Ar dates and evidence from the marine oxygen isotope record (MOIR) 66 \nto evaluate the volcanic evolution of Cerro Blanco.  It must be noted that accessibility to most of the exposed 67 \nrock around the outer caldera wall and Santa Gertrudis valley is severely limited due to the extreme topography, 68 \nand although access can be gained via the foot of the Santa Gertrudis valley to the north, this was beyond the 69 \nscope of this project.  Geochemical and radiometric analyses are therefore limited for these units but 70 \nobservations are included for completeness. 71 \n 72 \nField observations and petrography 73 \nField observations for each of the newly mapped units are described below.  Table 1 summarises the field 74 \nobservations and Table 2 gives a summary of the geochemistry and petrology for each newly mapped unit.  75 \nFurther geochemical data are provided with the online version of this article.  The distributions of newly 76 \nmapped and existing units at Cerro Blanco are provided in Figure 3. 77 \n 78 \n1. Santa Gertrudis valley and the outer caldera wall 79 \nThe upper reaches of the Santa Gertrudis valley (SGV) begin ~ 2.5 km to the north of the Cerro Blanco summit, 80 \nwhere several tributaries collect runoff from the north and western flanks of Cerro Blanco, the ICW and the 81 \nOCW before deflecting north into the R\u00edo Santa Gertrudis and the Santa Gertrudis valley proper.  From Cerro 82 \nBlanco, only the tops of the cliffs can be accessed.  Here, the valley is ~ 30 m wide with near vertical cliff faces 83 \nof 100-200 m in height.  The north and south sides of the valley appear to be comprised of two entirely different 84 \nlithologic units (SGV1 and SGV2, respectively), with the outer caldera wall unit (OC1) making up the third 85 \nnewly mapped unit in this locality.  86 \n 87 \nSGV1 \u2013 North Santa Gertrudis valley lava 88 \nDespite earlier mapping by Dixon et al. (1999) identifying the lavas in this area as the 81.5 ka old CB1 89 \nLanalhue Lavas, it is clear from the much greater degree of weathering and alteration, that the lava on the north 90 \nside of the Santa Gertrudis valley is much older and must be considered as a separate unit (SGV1).  The SGV1 91 \nlava exhibits a mixture of chaotic, hackly joints and irregular columnar joints.  The latter are ~ 10-20 cm in 92 \nwidth and sometimes up to 1 m in length, although are generally much less than this.  Since the cliff face was 93 \n 4\ninaccessible, detailed measurements of column orientation and geometry was not possible. The lava itself is 94 \ndark orange-brown and heavily weathered in appearance and geochemical analysis reveals this unit to be 95 \nandesitic in composition (69 wt % SiO2) (Table 2).   96 \n 97 \nSGV2 \u2013 South Santa Gertrudis valley sequence 98 \nThe SGV2 unit on the south side of the valley is, by contrast, much more complex with four separate facies 99 \nidentified (Fig. 4).  It is likely that each of these facies represents a separate geologic unit but since detailed 100 \nstudies of the cliffs were prevented by poor accessibility the facies have been grouped together for simplicity.  101 \nThe base of the cliffs is comprised of ~ 100 m thickness of massive, slightly weathered lava with no obvious 102 \nfracture patterns or bedding (Zone 1).  Above this, lies a 10-70 m thick section of pale grey, fine-grained and 103 \nbedded material (Zone 2).  This becomes thinner towards the west where it comes into contact with a 40 m 104 \nthick lens of columnar jointed lava (Zone 3). The succession is complete by the IC2 lava lobes (discussed later), 105 \nwhich is the only part of the cliff face that can be accessed from the cliff tops and hence no samples of the 106 \nSGV2 unit could be collected for geochemical or radiometric analysis. 107 \n 108 \nOC1 \u2013 Outer caldera wall lavas and breccias 109 \nOverlying the SGV1 lava on the north side of the valley is the outer caldera wall (Fig. 1).  It is ~ 2.5 km long 110 \nand comprises at least 10 separate, andesite (60 wt % SiO2) lavas flow deposits, each 5-10 m thick and inter-111 \nbedded with irregular layers (< 3 m thick) of red scoriaceous material (Fig. 5).  Towards the western end of the 112 \nOCW where the upper elevation is ~ 50 m lower than the eastern end, the lava is extremely polished and 113 \nexhibits two sets of striae with variable orientations.  The first set of striae is broad and deep and has the same 114 \nweathered surfaces of the surrounding rocks.  The second set, which cuts through the first, is much sharper and 115 \nnarrower, with fresher grey surfaces.  On both the west and east sides of the Santa Gertrudis valley, small 116 \npatches of breccia are banked up against the OC1 lavas.  The east side of the valley was inaccessible but 117 \nobservations through binoculars reveal that the breccia is bedded, dips gently (< 10\uf0b0) to the south and contacts 118 \nunconformably with the adjacent OC1 lava.   119 \n 120 \n2. Inner caldera wall units and facies 121 \nThe inner caldera wall (ICW) is also ~ 2.5 km long and curves around the northwestern flank of Cerro Blanco 122 \n(Figs. 1 and 3).  It is characterised by a topographic high at each end: Lanalhue at the southern extremity and 123 \nthe North Ridge at the northern extremity (Fig. 1).  Three different volcanic units have been identified along the 124 \n 5\nICW, each with characteristic facies: the inner caldera wall lavas (IC1), the inner caldera wall vent facies (IC2) 125 \nand a series of lava lobes, sills and dykes (IC3). 126 \n 127 \nIC1 \u2013 Inner caldera wall lavas 128 \nThe inner caldera wall lavas are best exposed at the southern end of the ICW, where at least six individual lava 129 \nflow deposits can be observed in the south-facing cliffs (Figs. 6 and 7).  The near vertical caldera wall scarp 130 \ncuts through the IC1 lavas to the east and a 25 m wide band of the lava is exposed half-way up the cliff face, 131 \nwith scree obscuring the lower 20-30 m and the IC2 Lanalhue vent topping the sequence (Fig. 6).  Each layer is 132 \n3-8 m thick and extends westwards (away from Cerro Blanco) for 10-100 m.  Whilst the two upper and two 133 \nlower lava flows dip gently westwards (~ 5\uf0b0), the two central lavas are much less uniform and in places the lava 134 \nhas draped over the underlying lavas forming several bulbous and hackly jointed lobes (Fig. 7).  The two upper 135 \nand two lower lavas exhibit broad columnar jointing and scoriaceous upper margins, whilst the two central 136 \nlavas are bulbous in places, with glassy texture and hackly or pseudopillow fractures (Mee et al., 2006).  137 \nIndividual lava flows are separated by irregular patches of breccia, which is comprised of 5-40 cm angular 138 \nclasts of lava in a pale grey and fine-grained matrix.  The geochemical composition of the lava flows range 139 \nfrom basaltic-andesite (54 SiO2 wt %) to dacite (65 SiO2 wt %). 140 \n 141 \nIC2 \u2013 Inner caldera wall vent facies 142 \nThe topographic highpoints at either end of the ICW (Lanalhue and the North Ridge) are characterised by 143 \nremnants of volcanic vents.  At the southern Lanalhue end, a 50 m thick cross-section through the vent facies is 144 \nexposed towards the top of the inner caldera wall cliffs (Fig. 8).  Several facies can be identified at the Lanalhue 145 \nand North Ridge vent locations, ranging in composition from basaltic andesite (55 wt % SiO2) to andesite (59 146 \nwt % SiO2).  The main constituent, present at both localities, is a series of bedded and welded breccia and 147 \nspatter deposits.  Secondly is a vesicular, andesitic body, which is exposed in the Lanalhue vent cross-section at 148 \nthe southern end of the inner caldera wall.  Thirdly, is the Upper Santa Gertrudis valley (USGV) lava, which 149 \nfirst crops out on the eastern flanks of the North Ridge and is exposed eastwards to the top of the Santa 150 \nGertrudis valley.  These facies are described in more detail below and in Tables 1 and 2, with the exception of 151 \nthe USGV lava, which is the subject of a more detailed study by Mee et al. (2006) and hence is only 152 \nsummarised here. 153 \n 154 \nWelded breccia and spatter 155 \n 6\nA cross-section through the Lanalhue vent exposes an ~ 20 m think sequence of andesitic, bedded breccia and 156 \nspatter, displaying varying degrees of welding.  Figure 9 summarises the typical structure and composition of 157 \nthe vent.  The beds can be traced southwards for up to 70 m, where they form a fanned array with the thickness 158 \nof the beds increasing from 25 cm to 3 m with distance from the centre of the vent.  The dip of the beds 159 \nincreases upwards through the succession from near horizontal to 45\uf0b0 S (i.e. back towards the centre of the 160 \nvent).  The structure of each bed becomes more chaotic towards the centre of the vent and, in places, exhibits 161 \nsubstantial brecciation, slumping and faulting (Fig. 9).  Contacts between the beds are often unconformable, 162 \nparticularly close to the centre of the vent.  Clast-supported, polymict breccia containing angular to heavily 163 \nsmeared glassy lithics and scoria bombs, fills the centre of the vent (Fig. 9).  A grey, platy dyke from the IC3 164 \nunit (described below) cuts through this breccia at an angle of ~ 85\uf0b0 S.  Small, 2-3 cm clasts of the dyke have 165 \nbeen incorporated into the adjacent breccia (Fig. 9). 166 \n To the north, any beds that were deposited are now obscured by a 50 m wide and up to 15 m high 167 \nandesitic body.  The texture is massive and vesicular with no bedding or fracturing.  Vesicles are roughly 168 \nspherical and range in size from 0.1-2 cm, with large vesicle accumulations of > 45 cm in diameter also present.  169 \nThe contact between the andesite body and the surrounding breccia is gradational over ~ 30 cm, with clasts of 170 \nbreccia being incorporated into the andesite. 171 \nTo the north, the highest point along the ICW reaches 2456 m at the top of the North Ridge.  Here, a 172 \nsmall plateau of ~ 0.5 km2 that slopes gently to the NW (away from the summit of Cerro Blanco) also exhibits a 173 \nseries of welded breccia and spatter beds (Fig. 10).  The beds form a curved, semi-circular array at the southern 174 \nend of the North Ridge (nearest to the Cerro Blanco summit) and exhibit similar features and structures as the 175 \nwelded breccia and spatter beds of the Lanalhue vent (Fig. 9).  As the North Ridge slopes away from Cerro 176 \nBlanco, dropping in elevation from 2456 m to 2375 m, the vent facies become increasingly polished and eroded 177 \nand is marked by one set of striations. 178 \n 179 \nUpper Santa Gertrudis valley (USGV) lava 180 \nThe andesitic, USGV lava can be divided into three textural and geomorphological zones, each occurring at 181 \ndifferent elevations (Table 1): autobrecciated and elongate lava lobes with pseudopillow fractures at the upper 182 \nelevations; interconnected, hackly-jointed lava lobes and hyaloclastite at the mid-elevations; and glassy, 183 \ncolumnar-jointed lava at the lower elevations. Detailed descriptions and palaeoenvironment interpretations for 184 \nthese facies and the Santa Gertrudis lava are given in Mee et al. (2006). 185 \n 186 \n 7\nICW3 \u2013 Subglacial lobes, sills and dykes 187 \nThis unit can be divided into two facies: (1) a series of grey platy sills and dykes cutting through the inner 188 \ncaldera wall vent sequence and in places cropping out onto the current topographic surface; and (2) glassy lava 189 \nlobes situated on the col to the south of the Lanalhue vent sequence (Fig. 6) and on the north and eastern flanks 190 \nof the North Ridge (Fig. 10). 191 \n 192 \nPlaty sills and dyke 193 \nThe sills and dykes are 1-3 m thick, with narrow (> 1-2cm) platy fractures aligned parallel to the flow surfaces.  194 \nSeveral platy sills cut below the IC2 andesite intrusion and in places have breached the ground surface on and 195 \nabove the col to the north of the Lanalhue sequence (Fig. 8).  In one case, a sill has breached the ground surface 196 \nat an elevation of ~2375 m in the col region to the north of the Lanalhue vent (Fig. 11).  The lava can be 197 \nfollowed laterally for less than 2 m before being reduced to scree and has a 10-15 cm thick, red scoriaceous 198 \nupper surface (Fig. 11).  The scree is estimated to cover an area of at least 100 m2. 199 \nA 2 m wide dyke also cuts through the IC1 cliffs and is exposed on the volcano-facing scarp (Fig. 8).  200 \nIt appears to feed a small laccolith at its top, which is exposed below the southern end of the IC2 welded 201 \nbreccia and spatter beds.  Poor accessibility meant that detailed observations of this structure were limited.  202 \nHowever, a sample collected by Dixon et al. (1999) during their 1996 expedition, is now known to have come 203 \nfrom base of this dyke (Jennie Gilbert, oral communication 2006).   204 \n  205 \nGlassy lava lobes 206 \nSeveral bulbous and glassy lava lobes crop out on the col that separates the Lanalhue ridge from the central 207 \nregions of the ICW and on the north and eastern flanks of the North Ridge.  The best examples of these lobes 208 \nare two steep-sided lava lobes on the col to the north of the Lanalhue vent (Figs. 6 and 11).   The more easterly 209 \nof the two lobes is 7 m high and 14 m wide, whilst the more westerly of the two lobes is 12 m high and 8 m 210 \nwide.  Both are bulbous in shape and have steep (> 45\uf0b0 to near vertical) outer margins, particularly those facing 211 \ndown-slope.  In between these two larger lobes are several smaller (~ 1 m diameter), interconnected lobes (Fig. 212 \n11).  The outer margins of the lobes are 25-50 cm thick and dominated by narrow (8-15 cm in diameter with 4-8 213 \nsides), glassy hackly joints.  The interior of the lobes is, by contrast, holocrystalline with 10-30 cm thick 214 \nconcentric fractures that break around phenocrysts.  Irregular patches of yellow, clast-supported and unbedded 215 \nbreccia is observed at the bases of the two larger lobes and surrounding the smaller lobes in the scree (Figure 216 \n11).  In places, finger-like structures of the breccia curve upwards into the overlying lava lobe (Fig. 11).   217 \n 8\n 218 \n40Ar\/39Ar analysis 219 \nBy determining the ages of volcanic units that have been interpreted as having erupted under certain conditions 220 \n(e.g. subglacially, in contact with snow\/ice or subaerially), we are able to: (1) confirm their stratigraphic 221 \nposition at Cerro Blanco and, (2) compare ages with the record of global temperature (marine oxygen isotope 222 \nrecord) in order to confirm that the interpreted conditions would have been likely at the time of eruption.  223 \nAlternatively, if field observations suggest that a lava was cooled under a substantial thickness of ice, yet 224 \nradiometric dates suggest that the volcano should not have been covered by snow or ice at the time of eruption, 225 \nthen this would trigger further study of either the volcanic fracture patterns and stratigraphic relationships or 226 \nradiometric dates to ensure that the most confident interpretations were reached. 227 \n 228 \nSample selection 229 \nAfter establishing stratigraphic relationships in the field, eight samples were selected for 40Ar\/39Ar analysis.  All 230 \nof these samples came from the inner caldera wall units, since poor accessibility to the outer caldera wall and 231 \nSanta Gertrudis valley made it impossible to obtain samples suitable for dating.  Samples were chosen on the 232 \nbasis of: 233 \n1. Palaeoclimatic importance \u2013 a mixture of subaerial, subglacial and snow-contact lavas were chosen to 234 \nenable correlation of the inferred eruptive environment with the marine oxygen isotope record.  It was 235 \nanticipated that the ages of these samples would span a glacial\/interglacial transition. 236 \n2. Stratigraphic importance \u2013 i.e. those units that displayed key stratigraphic relationships with other 237 \nunits not chosen for analysis; and 238 \n3. Compositional\/petrographic suitability for 40Ar\/39Ar dating \u2013 thin sections of all samples were studied 239 \nto select samples with the least amount of chemical alteration or other possible sources of 240 \ncontamination. 241 \nFollowing petrographic analysis, it was obvious that many of the more glassy rocks (and therefore those most 242 \nlikely to have erupted during subglacial conditions) would be unsuitable for 40Ar\/39Ar analysis and hence fewer 243 \nof these units were analysed than was originally intended.  Whole rock and groundmass separates were 244 \nanalysed at the Scottish Universities Research and Reactor Centre (SURRC), East Kilbride, Scotland, using the 245 \nsame 40Ar\/39Ar incremental-heating procedures as Dixon et al., (1999), which are more fully described in Singer 246 \nand Pringle (1996) and Harford et al., (2002).  To deem these dates acceptable, the following criteria were used 247 \n(Pringle, 1993; Singer and Pringle, 1996): 248 \n 9\n1. At least 3 contiguous high-temperature steps representing 50 % of the 39Ar must be used in the age 249 \ncalculation. 250 \n2. These steps must be below the F-variate critical value (Pringle, 1993; Taylor, 1982; Harford et al., 251 \n2002; York, 1969). 252 \n3. The plateau and isochron ages (Pringle, 1993; Singer and Pringle, 1996) must be concordant with one 253 \nanother (i.e. their errors should overlap). 254 \n4. The isochron 40Ar\/36Ar intercept should not be significantly different from the atmospheric argon value 255 \nof 295. 256 \n 257 \nResults 258 \nIn total, 8 samples from Cerro Blanco were selected for analysis, each representing different volcanic facies.  259 \nTwo samples (from IC1 and OC1) did not produce a full data set to enable age calculations and two others 260 \n(from IC1 and IC3) produced high errors and should, at best, be considered reconnaissance age estimates.  The 261 \nremaining four samples have yielded acceptable ages, although they represent only two of the newly mapped 262 \nunits (IC2 and IC3).  Table 3 gives a full summary of both the new and published (Dixon et al., 1999) 40Ar\/39Ar 263 \nanalyses for Cerro Blanco and the complete data repository is available from the journal\u2019s electronic archive. 264 \nThe IC2 unit has yielded three acceptable ages: 92.4 \u00b1 3.5 ka for the andesite intrusion located to the 265 \nnorth of the Lanalhue vent; 90.0 \u00b1 0.6 ka for the upper Santa Gertrudis Valley lava; and 88.9 \u00b1 1.0 ka for the 266 \nwelded breccia and spatter beds of the North Ridge.  A sample of the IC3 lava lobes, sills and dykes has 267 \nproduced two acceptable ages from different splits of the same sample.  Specifically, this sample comes from 268 \nthe sill that has breached the ground surface above the col region at the southern end of the ICW.  This unit has 269 \nbeen dated at 80.0 \u00b1 0.6 ka and 79.9 \u00b1 0.6 ka. 270 \n 271 \nDiscussion 272 \nIn recent years Cerro Blanco has had a permanent icecap and an even larger distribution of seasonal snow (Fig. 273 \n2).  Fracture structures associated with snow and\/or ice contact appear to be common features of the volcanic 274 \nunits on Cerro Blanco.  The distribution and extent of these fractures is vital for interpretation of the local 275 \nclimatic conditions at the time of eruption. 276 \nThe following sections use field observations and stratigraphic relationships to help interpret the 277 \neruptive settings of volcanic units at Cerro Blanco, particularly in terms of the presence or absence of snow and 278 \nice at the time of eruption.  We consider the various phases of volcanic evolution of Cerro Blanco and draw 279 \n 10\ncomparisons with other Andean volcanoes.  Finally, where 40Ar\/39Ar analysis has been successful, the ages are 280 \ncompared with the marine oxygen isotope record (MOIR) to confirm that field and stratigraphic observations of 281 \neach unit are concordant with climatic conditions at the time of eruption, i.e. if a lava is interpreted as having 282 \nerupted under a large thickness of ice, this should be supported by global ice volumes according to the MOIR. 283 \n 284 \nPalaeoenvironment interpretations 285 \nThe Santa Gertrudis valley and outer caldera wall 286 \nAt depths of nearly 200 m, the Santa Gertrudis valley is likely to have been an important runoff channel for 287 \nseveral hundred thousands of years.  The presence of narrow, hackly and chaotic columnar joints on the SGV1 288 \nlavas on the north side of the valley supports the presence of water during their emplacement, although the lack 289 \nof pillow structures suggests that this was not entirely subaqueous.  The chaotic nature of the columns is 290 \ntherefore interpreted as the upper, entablature zone of a two-tiered lava flow (Degraff et al., 1989).  This is 291 \nsimilar in structure to the upper zone of the Los Pincheira lavas (Dixon et al., 1999), which was interpreted by 292 \nDixon et al. to have cooled against glacial ice with meltwater causing the fine-scale penetrative jointing of the 293 \nentablature zone (Lescinsky and Sisson, 1998).  Whether the entablature zone of the SGV1 lava was caused by 294 \nglacial meltwater or runoff from the volcano is unclear since the lower portions of the cliffs were inaccessible. 295 \n The outer caldera wall cliffs, which lie stratigraphically above the SGV1 lavas, have been interpreted 296 \nby D\u00e9reulle and D\u00e9reulle (1974) as remnants of an ancient caldera wall on account of the abrupt cliff faces 297 \nseparating the recent volcanic cones at the centre of the complex from the older, shallow-dipping lavas to the 298 \nwest and north.  The broad, columnar joints, holocrystalline texture and scoriaceous upper surfaces of the lava 299 \nflows are indicative of slow cooling and hence the OC1 lavas are inferred to be subaerial (Cas and Wright, 300 \n1987).  Deep glacial striae and polishing to the upper surfaces of the cliffs at the western end of the OCW, 301 \nsuggest that the cliffs have been subjected to repeated glaciations.  By contrast, the eastern end of the OCW, 302 \nwhere elevation is 50-100 m higher, does not exhibit the same degree of polishing, suggesting that snow, ice 303 \nand water in this area were diverted into the Santa Gertrudis valley. 304 \n The complex mixture of facies on the south side of the Santa Gertrudis valley (SGV2) are clearly not 305 \npart of the SGV1 or OC1 units on the north side of the valley.  Since detailed observations of the cliffs could 306 \nnot be made, it is not possible to make meaningful interpretations of the different facies that make up SGV2.  It 307 \nis possible, however, to make inferences about relative ages of the units despite the lack of 40Ar\/39Ar ages, since 308 \nthe high levels of weathering to the north side of the valley (SGV1 and OC1), suggest they are much older than 309 \n 11\nthe SGV2 unit on the south side of the valley.  This adds further support to the interpretation of OC1 as caldera 310 \nwall cliffs, with the SGV2 unit representing the downthrown side of a caldera wall fault. 311 \n 312 \nThe inner caldera wall 313 \nThe northern extremity of the inner caldera wall is \u2018overlapped\u2019 by the outer caldera wall cliffs, which form an 314 \namphitheatre around the north and western flanks of the North Ridge.  This, along with the presence of two sets 315 \nof glacial striae and a greater degree of weathering on the outer caldera wall lavas compared to one set of 316 \nglacial striae on the inner caldera wall units, leads us to believe that the inner caldera wall cliffs and their 317 \nassociated geologic units are younger than those of the outer caldera wall and Santa Gertrudis valley.  318 \nThe IC1 lavas are the most extensive, covering an area of at least 1 km2, although it is likely that they 319 \nextend up to a further 2 km north, through the central region of the inner caldera wall (Figs. 3 and 4).  It is also 320 \nlikely that the IC1 lavas were, at one time, more extensive to the east but have since been cut by the inner 321 \ncaldera wall fault with any remnants now obscured by scree and the more recent Colcura cone and lavas (Dixon 322 \net al., 1999). 323 \nEach layer of the IC1 unit is thought to represent a separate pulse of lava that flowed west away from 324 \nthe current Cerro Blanco stratocone.  The two upper and two lower lava flows, with their crystalline interiors 325 \nand scoriaceous tops, exhibit characteristics typical of subaerial lavas (Cas and Wright, 1987).  Although the 326 \noverall dip of the lavas is west, away from Cerro Blanco, in places the two central lavas appear to have 327 \nfollowed topographic depressions causing the morphology to be bulbous in places (Figs. 5 and 6).  Hackly and 328 \npseudopillow fractures on the lava in these locations, along with their glassy texture, suggest that these lobes 329 \nwere cooled rapidly, either by steam, water or snow (Lescinsky and Fink, 2000; Mee et al., 2006).  The lack of 330 \nfragmental material (and the local distribution of ice-contact features) indicates that water did not accumulate in 331 \nany great volume, hence it is unlikely that a thick ice sheet was present during the time of eruption (Lescinsky 332 \nand Fink, 2000; Lescinsky and Sisson, 1998).  Since snow and ice are persistent throughout the year at 333 \nelevations of ~ 2300 m and upwards (i.e. the approximate elevation at which the IC1 lavas are exposed) it is 334 \nmore likely that portions of the lava flowed over or into snow and ice that had accumulated in topographic 335 \ndepressions, with steam and water from the melting snow causing hackly and pseudopillow fractures.  336 \n The IC2 vent facies is best exposed at the southern end of the ICW with the cross-section through the 337 \nLanalhue vent.  Several beds of welded breccia and spatter represent successive pulses of a small (< 0.25 km2) 338 \neruption.  The increasing dip of the beds towards the centre of the vent, suggests that material tended to 339 \naccumulate at distances of 50-70 m from the vent.  The presence of unconformable contacts, brecciation and 340 \n 12\nfaulting within the deposits at the mouth of the vent suggests a greater degree of instability with proximity to 341 \nthe vent.  Slumping within the beds has produced rheomorphic structures indicating that material flowed back 342 \ntowards the vent after initial deposition (Sumner and Branney, 2002).  Finally, the small andesitic body was 343 \nintruded to the north side of the vent.  It is suggested that the breccia that now fills the vent was part of the lava 344 \nintrusion and that the high level of oxidation is due to contact with either snow or water during intrusion 345 \n(Naranjo et al., 1992).  Since the dyke was well insulated from the breccia, its high temperature was preserved, 346 \nenabling the formation of the platy, welded and sheared structure during the high-pressure intrusion (Fig. 9).  347 \nThe final facies associated with the IC2 unit is the Upper Santa Gertrudis valley (USGV) lava, which is exposed 348 \non the eastern flanks of the North Ridge and in the upper reaches of the Santa Gertrudis valley.  The gradation 349 \nfrom one textural zone to another has led to the interpretation of a multi-phase cooling history of the lava, 350 \nconsisting of subaerial, snow-contact and then ice-constraint cooling environments at successively lower 351 \nelevations (Mee et al., 2006).  352 \nThe youngest unit associated with the inner caldera wall is IC3, a series of platy sills and dykes and 353 \nglassy lava lobes.  Where one of the dykes has breached the ground surface, the scoriaceous and vesicular top 354 \nsuggest it cooled subaerially (Cas and Wright, 1987) yet the glassy texture and polygonal, pseudopillow 355 \nfractures on the base are indicative of snow-contact (Mee et al., 2006).  Although the preserved lava only 356 \npersists for 2 m, the large volume of scree (~ 0.1 km2) suggests that, at one time, the lava was much more 357 \nextensive.  It is likely that melting snow at the base of the lava combined with the heavily fractured and 358 \nextremely brittle lava interior caused the lava to collapse. 359 \nSeveral pieces of evidence suggest that the glassy lava lobes, which are exposed at a lower elevation in 360 \nthe col to the north of the Lanalhue vent, were glacially cooled.  Firstly, the glassy and hackly jointed outer 361 \ncarapaces, which protect the more crystalline interior, imply quenching of the lava and fracture by steam 362 \npenetration (Lescinsky and Fink, 2000).  Since the lobe interiors are relatively crystalline compared to their 363 \nglassy outer carapaces, quenching and solidification of the carapace must have allowed the fluid lava of the 364 \ninterior to cool more slowly and develop a larger crystal size (Lescinsky and Fink, 2000).  Secondly, cooling 365 \nfractures can be used to infer the palaeo-cooling surface of a fractured lava body since they form perpendicular 366 \nto the cooling surface (Lescinsky and Sisson, 1998).  Although the chaotic nature of hackly joints means that 367 \nmeasurement of individual fracture surfaces would be unlikely to give true orientations of any former cooling 368 \nsurfaces, the presence of the quenched carapaces surrounding the remaining body of lava suggests they were 369 \nentirely enveloped by the cooling surface at the time of emplacement. 370 \n 13\nThe presence of hyaloclastite breccia around the base of the lobes would suggest that some degree of 371 \ninteraction with water occurred (Tuffen et al., 2001; Tuffen et al., 2002a, 2002b).  However, since there is a 372 \nlack of any ash-grade fragmental material (produced by phreatomagmatic activity) it seems unlikely that a large 373 \namount of water was present.  In addition to this, there are several factors that suggest that the 374 \npalaeotopography was similar to that of today and hence that water would have constantly drained down slope.  375 \nFirstly, part of the breccia beneath the more westerly of the two lobes has been folded upwards (Fig. 11c and d) 376 \ninto the base of the lobe, suggesting that some degree of post-emplacement gravitational slumping occurred.  377 \nSecondly, the steep, sub-vertical front surfaces of the lobes suggest that they were constrained down-slope by a 378 \nnear vertical, robust cooling surface, such as ice (Fig. 11).  Finally, the more easterly of the two IC3 lobes 379 \ndrapes either side of the existing col (Fig. 11a and b), suggesting that a similar topography to that of today was 380 \npresent during the time of emplacement.  All these factors favour down-slope drainage of water away from the 381 \nlava lobes, thus making it virtually impossible for significant volumes of water to have accumulated.  It is, 382 \ntherefore, more likely that the surrounding breccia was caused by intrusion of the sills through a waterlogged 383 \nsubstrate (Tuffen et al., 2001; Tuffen et al., 2002a, 2002b) followed by disaggregation and brecciation.  Breccia 384 \nat the base of the lobes is most likely to have been caused by further quenching and brecciation of the lava as it 385 \nslumped downwards. 386 \nSince the base of one of the sills that breached the ground surface appears to have been cooled by 387 \nsnow-contact (Mee et al., 2006) rather than subglacially, it may be used in conjunction with the subglacial lava 388 \nlobes at a lower elevation on the col to estimate the approximate upper level of ice at the time of emplacement 389 \n(Fig. 12). For example, we know that the sill penetrated the ground surface above the Lanalhue col at the 390 \ncurrent altitude of ~ 2325 m.  The glassy, quenched texture on the base of the lava suggests that it was rapidly 391 \ncooled, most likely due to snow-contact given the presence of pseudopillow fractures (Mee et al., 2006).  It is 392 \nthought that as the ice and snow retreated, any lava that had flowed over the snow and cooled would have 393 \ncollapsed, resulting in the large volume of scree that remains in the vicinity today.  In this case, 2325 m would 394 \nhave been the approximate upper limit of ice (Fig. 12).  Sills lower down in the col region (at ~ 2250 m 395 \nelevation) were emplaced subglacially causing constraint of the lava, which enabled quenching and 396 \nsolidification of the outer carapace and resulted in the steep front surfaces observed on the lobes today.  In 397 \naddition, the subglacial lobes on the north and eastern flanks of the North Ridge also appear to have been 398 \nemplaced subglacially at 2275m, further supporting the inference of the upper level of ice between 2275m and 399 \n2325m.  Figure 12 shows our interpretation of the palaeoenvironment into which the IC3 sills and lobes were 400 \n 14\nemplaced.  From our interpretation we think that a valley glacier was present on Cerro Blanco approximately 80 401 \nka ago and that the IC3 lobes were ice-constrained. 402 \n 403 \nVolcanic evolution and caldera formation 404 \nSince detailed geochemical analyses have not been conducted during this study, the magmatic evolution of 405 \nCerro Blanco is not discussed and to do so would require further investigation.  Instead, we focus on the 406 \nchronology of eruptive events at Cerro Blanco and discuss caldera formation. 407 \n Volcanic units at Cerro Blanco appear to fall into two categories: (1) those that erupted from a central 408 \nvent (or vents) producing voluminous (up to 10 km3) lava flows that dip and radiate away from the current 409 \nvolcanic centre; and (2) those which erupted from smaller vents along the caldera wall faults and tend to be 410 \nlocalised and less voluminous (< 1 km3).  The oldest known units to be associated with Nevados de Chill\u00e1n 411 \nvolcano are the Los Pincheira lavas at 640 ka old, which are thought to be part of the early development of the 412 \nvolcanic complex due to their radial distribution around the volcano before either caldera was formed (Dixon et 413 \nal., 1999).  The next oldest units are those that make up the Santa Gertrudis valley and caldera wall lavas 414 \n(SGV1, SGV2, OC1 and IC1).  These all fall into the former category of lavas erupted from a central vent and 415 \nwe believe these to be part of an older complex for the following reasons: 416 \n1. The lavas all dip away from the caldera wall and therefore appear to have originated from much higher up 417 \nthe volcano, towards the current summit of Cerro Blanco.  Although their exact sources are unknown, they 418 \nshow no evidence of having erupted along a caldera wall fault.  419 \n2. They are estimated to be at least twice the (preserved) volume of the IC2 and IC3 units, which extend for 420 \nonly a short distance (20-200 m) away from the caldera wall.  By contrast, the inner and outer caldera wall 421 \nlavas are 50-150 m in thickness and extend up to 1 km away from the volcano.  The Santa Gertrudis valley 422 \nsequences are 100-200 m in thickness and occupy the entire Santa Gertrudis valley.  All appear to be much 423 \nmore weathered and altered than the IC2 and IC3 units. 424 \nThe age constraints for this older complex are rather loose (640-90 ka old) but they are dissected by at least two 425 \ncaldera-forming events.  A lack of detailed study of the outer caldera wall makes it impossible to infer the 426 \ntiming of caldera formation, unlike the inner caldera where ages of both pre- and post-caldera collapse units 427 \nprovide a relatively tight timescale for caldera formation.  The cross-section through the Lanalhue vent at the 428 \nsouthern end of the inner caldera wall is clear evidence that the vent facies (IC2) were emplaced prior to caldera 429 \nformation, since the caldera fault cuts through this unit.  By contrast, the IC3 unit crops out on the col region to 430 \nthe south of the Lanalhue vent where it has draped down the caldera wall fault, suggesting that the 431 \n 15\npalaeotopography was similar to present day and hence suggesting IC3 was emplaced post-caldera formation.  432 \nThis would put the caldera collapse event that produced the inner caldera wall at between 90 and 80 ka BP, 433 \nwhich agrees with the Pleistocene age interpreted by Naranjo et al. (1994) and Dixon et al. (1999).   434 \nSeveral volcanic facies have been identified along the inner caldera wall, all of which have been 435 \nassigned to the IC2 vent unit.  Since three of these ages (92.4 \u00b1 3.5 ka, 90.0 \u00b1 0.6 ka and 88.9 \u00b1 1.0 ka) are 436 \nstatistically indistinguishable, the exact order of eruptions at either end of the caldera wall is uncertain, although 437 \nthey are likely to have been simultaneous.  The strong lithological and chronological correlation between the 438 \nvent sequences at each end of the inner caldera wall facies suggests that volcanic activity was occurring along 439 \nthe entire length of the inner caldera wall at ca. 90 ka.  It is quite possible that eruption of the IC2 vent facies 440 \ncreated the initial fracture lines along which caldera collapse ultimately occurred, with subsequent eruptions 441 \nover the following millennia (i.e. of the IC3 unit) continuing to exploit these structural weaknesses. 442 \nSome time after eruption along the caldera fault, volcanism switched to the modern Cerro Blanco and 443 \nLas Termas subcomplexes with lavas being erupted from several vents located around either stratocone (Dixon 444 \net al., 1999).  At the latest, this would have occurred at 23.9 ka ago given the age of the oldest known lava to 445 \nhave erupted from the modern Cerro Blanco cone (i.e. CB2a of Dixon et al., 1999).  This stratocone has been 446 \nactive as recently as 1865 with the eruption of the Santa Gertrudis lava (Dixon et al.,1999; Mee et al., 2006). 447 \nThe combination of extreme topography and large accumulations of snow and ice make access to all 448 \nremnants of the caldera walls (inner and outer) very difficult.  Since this project has focussed primarily on the 449 \nCerro Blanco subcomplex it is not possible to make any accurate interpretations of caldera forming 450 \nmechanisms, which of course would apply to the entire Nevados de Chill\u00e1n Volcanic Complex and not just the 451 \nCerro Blanco subcomplex.  It is unclear by what mechanism the calderas at Cerro Blanco (and hence Nevados 452 \nde Chill\u00e1n) formed but there are many models that have been applied to Andean volcanoes.  Through the 453 \nCentral Volcanic Zone (CVZ) and the northern sector of the Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ), caldera collapse is 454 \noften attributed to large-magnitude explosive volcanism, characterised by plinian fall deposits and ignimbrites 455 \n(Gilbert et al., 1996).  Such deposits do occur at Nevados de Chill\u00e1n, particularly to the south and west of the 456 \nLas Termas subcomplex (Dixon et al., 1999), but these have not been studied or mapped in detail and thus it is 457 \nunknown whether they are related to any caldera-forming process.  By contrast, caldera formation at the 458 \npredominantly mafic volcanoes of the southern SVZ, show less evidence to suggest they formed by explosive 459 \nvolcanism (Gilbert et al., 1996). 460 \nAt Sollipulli, Gilbert et al. (1996) describe how the caldera was filled with a large body of ice (volume 461 \n> 6 km3) soon after caldera collapse and that subsequent volcanic eruptions occurred along the caldera margins 462 \n 16\nrather than under the greatest thickness of ice (i.e. towards the centre of the caldera).  This is, at least in part, 463 \nsimilar to the eruption of the IC3 subglacial lobes, dykes and sills along the inner caldera wall after caldera 464 \ncollapse, and it is certain that the caldera was at least partially filled with ice (up to ~ 2325 m; Fig. 12) during 465 \nthis time.  However, it must be noted that if any volcanism had occurred towards the centre of the caldera, the 466 \nmodern Cerro Blanco complex would now cover these units. 467 \nVolcanic units erupted from the Cerro Blanco subcomplex can be assigned to three periods of volcanic 468 \nactivity: (1) the older, pre-caldera collapse complex; (2) caldera formation and eruption along the inner caldera 469 \nwall fault and (3) the modern volcanic complex.  This type of evolution whereby caldera collapse is followed 470 \nby growth of a new stratocone is common at many Andean volcanoes.  At Nevado del Tolima, Colombia, 471 \nThouret et al. (1995) describe four periods of eruptive activity.  The early period produced Quaternary age 472 \nbasement lava flows, followed by the formation of an ancient stratovolcano, which has since been cut by 473 \ncaldera formation.  A second stratovolcano was subsequently formed and is now overlain by the modern Tolima 474 \ncomplex.  The early constructive phase of volcanism at Puyehue, Chile, is estimated to comprise 80 % of the 475 \ntotal volume and is characterised by two broad shields (Singer et al., 2008).  The modern Puyehue stratovolcano 476 \nhas since been built on the more southerly of these two shields (Singer et al., 2008).  Clavero et al. (2004) have 477 \nidentified four stages of volcanic evolution at Parinacota volcano, Chile: (1) the early formation of dome 478 \ncomplexes and associated pyroclastic deposits; (2) formation of a steep-sided stratocone on top of this dome 479 \ncomplex; (3) partial collapse of the volcanic edifice; and (4) formation of a new steep-sided stratocone and 480 \nseveral flank cones. 481 \nAt Cerro Blanco, the early, constructive phase of volcanism is characterised by the eruption of 482 \nmultiple, shallow-dipping lava flows that make up the Santa Gertrudis valley and both the outer and inner 483 \ncaldera wall units (i.e. SGV1, SGV2, OC1 and IC1).  The more localised eruptions along the inner caldera wall, 484 \nthat produced the vent facies (IC2) and subglacial lava lobes (IC3), coincide with a period of caldera formation 485 \nand collapse when volcanism was restricted to the caldera wall fault.  Finally, volcanism switched to the centre 486 \nof the complex with the production of the modern Cerro Blanco stratocone. 487 \n 488 \nComparison with the marine oxygen isotope record 489 \nFigure 13 shows the chronology of eruptions at Cerro Blanco over the past ca. 120 ka, alongside the marine 490 \noxygen isotope record (MOIR) where oxygen isotope variations are used as a proxy for global ice volumes.  491 \nThe lack of 40Ar\/39Ar ages for the older Cerro Blanco subcomplex makes it difficult to assign them to a 492 \nparticular stage of the MOIR and although we know a minimum age of 92.4 ka, they are likely to be much 493 \n 17\nolder.  Prior to 92.4 ka, early volcanic activity at Cerro Blanco produced the inner and outer caldera wall lavas 494 \n(OC1 and IC1), the platform on which the modern volcanic subcomplex is built.  A large amount of volcanic 495 \nactivity occurred between ca. 80-92.4 ka during the second half of marine oxygen isotope stage (MOIS) 5, 496 \nwhen eruptions were apparently confined to the edges of the caldera.  The eruption of the IC2 vent facies at ca. 497 \n90 ka is thought to coincide with the initial formation of the inner caldera wall fault, and subaerial textures on 498 \nthe vent facies suggest that, locally at least, ice was lower than 2300 m.  By ca. 80 ka, when the IC3 dykes, sills 499 \nand subglacial lobes were emplaced, the inner caldera was formed and was likely to have been filled with ice.  500 \nThe upper level of the ice can be constrained to between 2275 m and 2325 m (the approximate elevation of the 501 \ncaldera rim) given the presence of subaerial, snow-contact and subglacial features on the same unit (Fig. 12) 502 \n(Mee et al., 2006).  It is likely that a combination of an ice-filled caldera and the presence of the inner caldera 503 \nwall fault caused the eruption of the IC3 unit to be confined to the rim of the caldera (Gilbert et al., 1996). 504 \n An apparent hiatus in volcanic activity at Cerro Blanco occurred between 80 and 25 ka, although 505 \neruptions were taking place elsewhere on Nevados de Chill\u00e1n (Dixon et al., 1999).  When volcanism returned to 506 \nCerro Blanco, focus had shifted to the centre of the complex with the eruption of the CB2 Colcura and eastern 507 \nunits, which Dixon et al. (1999) suggest are remnants of a probable post-caldera collapse shield volcano, 508 \noverlain by remnants of a steep-sided andesitic stratocone.  Ages for this unit suggest it would have been 509 \nerupted during the last glacial maxima in the area, which occurred between 33.5-14 ka according to Lowell et 510 \nal. (1995).  It is unknown, however, if this unit exhibits any subglacial or ice-contact features that would be 511 \nconsistent with widespread glaciation.  Subsequent eruptions at Cerro Blanco, up to and including the eruption 512 \nof the Santa Gertrudis (CB4) lava between 1861-1865 (Dixon et al., 1999) have continued to build the modern 513 \nstratocone. 514 \n 515 \nConclusions 516 \n 517 \n1. Identification of volcanic facies characteristic of subaerial, subaqueous, subglacial, ice-constraint and 518 \nsnow-contact activity is important for establishing past eruptive environments and particularly for 519 \nestablishing palaeoclimate conditions at the time of an eruption.  Ages of glacially-cooled lavas can be 520 \ncompared with the marine oxygen isotope record to confirm whether or not large amounts of snow and ice 521 \nwere likely to have been present on the volcano at the time of an eruption.  Volcanic facies are, therefore, 522 \npowerful tools for palaeoclimate reconstruction as well as for interpreting past eruptive environments.   523 \n 524 \n 18\n2. Six new volcanic units, each displaying a wide range of volcanic facies, have been identified along the 525 \ninner caldera wall, the outer caldera wall and in the upper Santa Gertrudis valley of Cerro Blanco and a 526 \nnew geologic map has been produced. 527 \n 528 \n3. The North and South Santa Gertrudis valley units, and the outer and inner caldera wall units (SGV1, 529 \nSGV2, OC1 and IC1, respectively) are thought to represent an older volcanic complex, characterised by 530 \nvoluminous (> 10 km3), constructional volcanism; a feature which is typical of many Andean volcanoes. 531 \n 532 \n4. The inner caldera wall fault was an important location for volcanism between 100 and 80 ka BP, during 533 \nwhich time it is thought that the inner caldera wall was formed.  At ca. 90 ka BP, volcanism was occurring 534 \nat both ends of the inner caldera walls producing welded breccia and spatter beds on the ridge tops and 535 \nsubglacial lavas (USGV lava) in the valleys, suggesting that a small valley glacier was present at the time 536 \nof eruption.  At ca. 80 ka BP, after the inner caldera wall had been formed, a series of sills and dykes was 537 \nintruded along the inner caldera wall, some of which were intruded into ice below a level of ~ 2325 m, 538 \nproducing subglacial lobes. 539 \n 540 \n5. Volcanic evolution at Cerro Blanco can be divided into three periods of eruptive activity: (1) constructive, 541 \npre-caldera collapse volcanism; (2) caldera formation and collapse; and (3) formation of the modern Cerro 542 \nBlanco stratocone.  This volcanic cycle is typical at many Andean volcanoes.  543 \n 544 \nAcknowledgements 545 \nThe authors would like to thank Hugh Tuffen and Mike James for their valuable contributions in the field, along 546 \nwith Holly Frey and Charles Stern for their thorough reviews, all of which have considerably improved this 547 \nmanuscript.
