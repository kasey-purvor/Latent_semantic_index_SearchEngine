The information content of the data \nsets is examined using a series of modern processing and modelling procedures that provide a \nfull assessment of their resolution capabilities. The framework for the study involves two \ncomponents. The first relates to the definition of the shallow magnetic structure in relation to \nan ongoing 1:10k and 1:50k geological map revision. The second component relates to the \nperformance of the datasets in defining maps of magnetic basement and assisting with larger \nscale geological and structural interpretation. One of the smaller HiRES survey areas, the \nisland of Anglesey (Ynys M\u00f4n), off the coast of NW Wales is used to provide a series of \ncomparative studies.

A more sporadic series of multi-\nparameter, higher resolution, airborne surveys have been undertaken, largely for mineral \nreconnaissance, since that period. These surveys, along with other onshore airborne \ngeophysical surveys which acquired magnetic data through to 1991, are described by \nCornwell et al. (1995).   The main, spatially coherent, onshore UK magnetic database still \ncomprises the 530,648 points of the original and fully processed data set referred to here as \nthe GSGB (Geological Survey Great Britain) magnetic data compilation. This data set formed \nthe basis of the 1:1.5M UK magnetic map compilation published and described by the British \nGeological Survey (BGS, 1998). The underlying data set forms the baseline magnetic \ncoverage of the UK. Modern geological map revision is typically undertaken at a scale of \n1:10k and concealed geology and structure is often assessed using magnetic field information. \nIn order to assist with such revision, the sampling of the available magnetic information must \nbe adequate. By modern standards, the typical 2 to 4 km flight line separation and high \nelevation (~300 m) of the GSGB surveys provide only a low resolution assessment of onshore \nUK.  \nIn order to establish a modern UK magnetic baseline data set, the BGS initiated a series of \nairborne surveys beginning in 1998. The new surveys included magnetic, radiometric and \nelectromagnetic measurements that both individually, and in combination, offered high \nresolution geophysical assessments of the UK landmass. The set of surveys, referred to as \nHiRES (High Resolution airborne Resource and Environmental Surveys), were typically \nflown at low elevation (90 m or less) and ultimately a \u2018national-scale\u2019 line separation of 200 \nm was adopted. Only the HiRES magnetic data sets are discussed here since they update and \npotentially supersede existing information. The radiometric and electromagnetic data sets \nacquired represent new information. \nIt is self-evident that a modern magnetic survey, obtained with higher precision and reduced \nline spacing and elevation, will provide an improved data set. However the distinctions \nbetween the two available resources, existing and new, has not been fully explored or \nquantified. An example of some of the perpetual issues and difficulties arising in the near-\nsurface geological interpretation of the existing GSGB data set can be found in Dagley et al. \n(2008). A further useful comparison of modern and legacy airborne magnetic data sets with \nPage\u00a05\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\nmarine exploration data across the Donegal Basin, Ireland is provided by Allsop et al. \n(2002).In order to understand the differing information content of the vintage and new data \nsets it is necessary to undertake a case study and subject the data to a series of modern \nprocessing and modelling procedures that provide a full assessment of their resolution \ncapabilities.  \nThe present study uses the relatively self-contained geological context area of Anglesey \n(Ynys M\u00f4n), North Wales where existing GSGB and new HiRES magnetic data sets exist. \nThe island of Anglesey lies off the northwest coast of Wales, separated from the mainland by \nthe Menai Strait. Primary geological surveying was published in 1920 and because of the \nrelative antiquity of this data the island is currently undergoing targeted re-mapping by the \nBGS (Phillips, 2009). The HiRES survey was undertaken in response to this map revision. \nThe geological and tectonic interpretation framework of the region is complex (and often \ndisputed) so the provision of subsurface geophysical information is clearly of some relevance. \nThe location of the Anglesey survey is shown in Figure 1.  \nThe magnetic data obtained across Anglesey are challenging in that the strong response of a \nnear surface dyke swarm potentially masks, and certainly interferes with, the response of \ndeeper basement features.  The processing undertaken involves an assessment of both the \nshallow and deep (basement) information contained in the two data sets. \n \n2 GEOLOGICAL SETTING \nThe geology of Anglesey was originally described and mapped by Greenly (1919) who first \nused the term Mona Complex to describe the Neoproterozoic rocks that underlie much of the \nisland. Here we refer to the work of Gibbons & Hor\u00e1k (1990) who described the \nNeoproterozoic in terms of three main terranes as shown in Figure 2. These fault-bounded \nblocks are collectively recognised today as the Monian Composite Terrane. This terrane is \nmade up of smaller crustal fragments known as the Monian Supergroup, the Coedana \nComplex and Aethwy (Blueschist) Complex. These are overlain by a patchy Palaeozoic cover \nsuccession including remnants of an Ordovician-Silurian sedimentary marine basin, an Old \nRed Sandstone fluvial succession, as well as Carboniferous limestone and coal measures. \nPage\u00a06\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Neoproterozoic rocks on Anglesey are discussed by  Hor\u00e1k & Gibbons (2000). The \nCoedana Complex forms a denuded outcrop comprising upper amphibolite rocks (commonly \nreferred to as gneisses), granite and a hornfels carapace. The complex includes the highest \ngrade metamorphic rocks on the island, separating the greenschist facies Monian Supergroup, \nto the north-west, from the blueschist facies rocks, to the south-east. Because of the contrast \nin grade and the pressure-temperature conditions of formation, Gibbons and Hor\u00e1k (1990) \nhave argued that these belts must have been generated in separate terranes and subsequently \njuxtaposed by faults. The north-west boundary of the complex is a post-Arenig brittle fault \nzone (Llyn Traffwll Shear Zone) whereas the south-east boundary is a wide ductile zone. \nAlthough Greenly (1919) concluded that \u2018the granite intruded and merged with the gneiss\u2019 \nand that they were contemporary, clear relationships are not exposed (Howells, 2007).  \nThe blueschists of the Aethwy Terrane are one of the oldest occurrences of such rocks in the \nworld and can be related to exhumation of a subducted oceanic slab between around 560-550 \nMa (Dallmeyer & Gibbons, 1987). The unit is isolated from all other tectonostratigraphical \nunits by ductile shear zones; the Berw Shear Zone in the north-west and the Bryn Meur\u00efg \nShear Zone in the south-east. The Berw Fault (see Figure 4) is the most westerly of the Menai \nStraits Fault System, a terrane boundary that was reactivated into brittle fault displacements \nthroughout Phanerozoic time (Howells, 2007). \nThe age of the Monian Supergroup has been a subject of controversy over many years. \nEssentially the sequence is more intensely deformed and metamorphosed than the Cambrian \non the mainland but, as discussed by Howells (2007), the elevation of the Monian Supergroup \ninto the Cambrian seems unavoidable. Greenly (1919) discussed the subdivisions of the \nMonian Supergroup and recognised the Bedded Series, the Gneisses and the Coedana granite \nand considered that they each reflected successive periods of development. The formations \nmaking up the Monian Supergroup are further discussed by Phillips (1991). \n\u00a0\nThe fault systems in the vicinity of the Menai Strait, separating Anglesey from the mainland, \nhave been regarded as a major Precambrian tectonic boundary (Gibbons 1987; Carney et al. \n2000). The zone separates two distinct Avalonian terranes comprising British type Avalonian \nrocks to the south and those of the Monian Composite Terrane largely contained within \nAnglesey. In addition to the terranes discussed above, Figure 2 also shows mapped zones \nPage\u00a07\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(1:250k scale) of basic and ultrabasic intrusives. As discussed later, the former constitute part \nof a largely concealed Palaeogene dyke swarm which adds a degree of complexity to the \nassessment of magnetic basement. The more localised occurrences of ultrabasic rocks, again \npartially concealed, possess some of the largest magnetic responses observed by the airborne \nsurvey.  The observations of Maltman (1975) indicate their consistency with Neoproterozoic \nocean-plate subduction provided the model allows for magmatic ascent of the intrusives and \ntheir alteration and deformation in situ.  \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3 UK ONSHORE MAGNETIC DATA SETS \nTotal field Magnetic Intensity (TMI) data is usually provided as a superimposed \u2018anomaly\u2019 \nfield related to a model of the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) determined \nat a date appropriate to the acquisition of the data. The GSGB data is referred to IGRF 1990 \nand the HiRES data is referred to IGRF 2009. \nThe shape of magnetic anomalies varies as a function of geomagnetic latitude. At northern \nmid-latitudes, such as the UK, it is useful to transform the data using a filtering operation \ncalled \u2018reduction-to-the-pole\u2019 or RTP (Blakely, 1995), that generates anomalies that peak \nover the source location. The transform assumes that the primary source magnetisation is \naligned parallel or anti-parallel (within 25\u00b0; Bath, 1968) to the local geomagnetic field vector. \nSome volcanic flows and cultural noise sources may provide anomalies with remnant \nmagnetisation directions that violate the assumption. Structures providing normally and \nreversely magnetised fields should be adequately represented in terms of their source \nlocation. \n3.1 The GSGB national baseline compilation \nThe baseline aeromagnetic data for the UK were acquired between 1955 and 1965, with \nsections of the survey being flown in different years by Hunting Geology and Geophysics Ltd \nand Canadian Aeroservices Ltd. The survey was primarily funded by the Department of \nScientific and Commercial Research and, in Northern Ireland, by the Department of \nCommerce. The data for Northern Ireland are held by BGS on behalf of the Department of \nPage\u00a08\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEconomic Development of Northern Ireland. The data sets underlying the 1:1.5M UK \nmagnetic map compilation are described by BGS (1998). \nThe bulk of the surveys were flown with a flight line spacing of 2km, with tie-lines usually at \n10km. The orientation of the flight lines varied between annual surveys (either N-S or E-W), \ndependent on the predominant geological strike direction, so as to optimise the resolution of \nthe data. Most of the country was covered with a flight height of 1000 feet (305 m) mean \nterrain clearance. \nThe magnetic field was measured by a fluxgate magnetometer, recording onto a continuous \npaper chart. Positional information was derived from a navigation camera mounted vertically \nin the aircraft, marking the paper chart at every exposure. Over the sea, Decca navigation was \nused. Heights were determined by radio altimetry, except in early surveys, when aneroid \nbarometric instruments were used. \nAfter initial reduction, the data were hand-contoured at 10 nT intervals, forming the primary \nresults of the survey. Flight line\/contour line intercepts were subsequently digitised from \nthese maps by BGS Regional Geophysics to produce the digital aeromagnetic data set for the \nUK, comprising 530 648 points. The data have been reprocessed to refer anomalies to a \nvariant of IGRF-90, which makes allowance for the inaccurate prediction of the geomagnetic \nfield model prior to 1971. \nThe area selected for our study incorporates data from 2 separate zones having principal \nsurvey flight lines in the E-W direction (with line separation of 4 km) and in the N-S direction \n(with line separation of 2 km).  The selected rectangle is 110 x 135 km in size with the \nwestern edge of the rectangle limited by the GSGB data set. The typical maximum grid \nresolution (using a quarter-wavelength sampling criterion) that can be achieved using the \nGSGB data is 500 x 500 m.  Obviously in certain undersampled localities, gridding at the \nmaximum resolution may produce artefacts. This is illustrated in Figure 3 which shows the \nmagnetic anomaly information obtained using a minimum curvature gridding interval of 500 \nx 500 m. The coordinate system used throughout is the British National Grid (BNG). The \nhighly non-uniform sampling provided by the GSGB data set is indicated by the point \nsymbols. Some gaps in the sampled grid have necessarily been interpolated. \nPage\u00a09\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe selected data set comprises 9645 points and the gridded data provide anomaly values in \nthe range from -294 to 598 nT.  The image uses a linear colour scale with shading from the \nNE. When using a linear colour scale in this and subsequent images, the upper and lower \nlimits of the colour scale are reduced in relation to the full data range in order to improve the \ndynamic resolution of the image. The largest amplitude TMI (Total Magnetic Intensity) \nanomaly values are observed in association with the Snowdon Massif in the SE of the area. \nElsewhere, magnetic high values associated with longer wavelengths display a NE-SW \norientation. These are features that we would associate with magnetic basement. Even with no \nprocessing applied to the data, a series of higher wavenumber linear features can be traced \ncrossing the area with a NW-SE trend. These features are a series of Palaeogene dykes that \nhave been previously discussed, in terms of their geophysical responses, by Kirton & Donato \n(1985) and by Bevins et al. (1996). The dykes form part of a very large scale and extensive \nset of Irish Sea dyke swarms that appear to connect with Palaeogene centres in Northern \nIreland. The rectilinear polygonal area around the coast of Anglesey outlines the HiRES \nsurvey area discussed below. \n\u00a0\n3.2 HiRES data sets \nThe HiRES data sets acquired across onshore UK are shown in Figure 1. All the surveys were \nconducted using modern caesium vapour magnetometers with quoted noise levels of 0.1 nT. \nThe first of these surveys (HiRES-1) was obtained in 1998 across the North Midlands. Survey \nand acquisition parameters are described in detail by Peart et al. (2003). The survey was \nflown at an elevation of 90 m in open areas increasing to 240 m across populated areas. Flight \nline separation was generally 400 m with a tie line spacing of 1200 m. Flight line and tie line \nseparations were reduced to 200 m and 600 m respectively over 3 infill areas of special \ninterest. The initial HiRES data obtained across densely populated areas allowed assessments \nof semi-automated cultural noise suppression and removal techniques to be investigated  \n(Peart et al. 2003; Cuss 2003). The HiRES-1 survey was followed by four other multi-\nparameter surveys employing a Twin-Otter platform (see Beamish & Young, 2009). These \nlater surveys were all conducted using a 200 m line separation and at reduced survey \nelevations of below 60 m. Regulatory control again required increasing the survey elevation \nto 200 m above populated areas. The Anglesey survey (Fig. 1) was the last survey to be flown \n(in 2009) and covers 1198 km2. The data from this survey form the basis of the present study. \nPage\u00a010\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3.3 HiRES Anglesey survey \nThe acquisition parameters and processing procedures applied to the Anglesey survey data \nare described by Beamish & White (2009) and White & Beamish (2010). Flight line direction \nwas N-S in order to intersect geological features having two predominant directions (NW-SE \nand NE-SW). The Anglesey HiRES TMI anomaly map is shown in Figure 4.  HiRES data \ncollected at 200 m line separations are routinely gridded at 50 m intervals, although along-\nline sampling of the field is about 5 m. In this study we use minimum-curvature gridding with \nAkima spline functions since more advanced procedures, for example making use of cross-\nline gradients, tend to smear the response of localised noise sources. The TMI image uses a \nlinear colour scale with shading from the NE. The magnetic measurements comprise 1.04 \nmillion data points and the gridded data set has maximum and minimum values of 1439 and -\n2645 nT, respectively. If the GSGB data set is also restricted to the HiRES survey polygon it \ncontains 1440 data points with a range of values from -236 to 301 nT. The lower flying height \nand increased flight line sampling of the HiRES surveys inevitably leads to an improved \nregistration of the actual field distribution. Figure 4 also shows geological line work of the \n1:250k mapping of fault lines. Two particular faults, with particular relevance to the magnetic \ndata, are labelled CH and BF. Both CH (Carmel Head) and BF (Berw) faults are major shear \nzones with the Carmel Head Fault representing a thrust with its hanging wall to the north. \nIf an initial comparison is made of the TMI anomaly data across Anglesey, it is evident that \nthe longer wavelength features trending NE-SW are reproduced in both data sets. At shorter \nwavelengths, it is also apparent that the majority of magnetic features observed in Figure 4 \nare poorly defined and suffer from extensive aliasing in the GSGB data set. The HiRES data \nprovide significant detail in the mapping of the sequence of quasi-linear, NW-SE trending \nnegative anomalies that we associate with the largely concealed Palaeogene dykes. The \nlargest negative anomaly is associated with the dyke labelled 1 in Figures 3 and 4. Other \nexpressions of weaker negative features are also observed to the NE of the main swarm axis. \nAlthough there are many new magnetic structures resolved and thus revealed when the \nHiRES data are further processed, three high amplitude features are worth noting. The first \nfeature is labelled 2 in Figure 4 and corresponds to a series of ultrabasic (serpentinite) bodies \nthat provide anomaly values in excess of 800 nT. The new data set provides considerable \ndetail in relation to the subsurface continuity of the body. The second feature, labelled 3 in \nFigure 4 is only revealed by its geophysical response since it exists offshore (and is modelled \nPage\u00a011\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\nat subsea depths). The structure comprises a central positive core surrounded by a crescent-\nshaped zone of positive anomalies. The feature, having an average diameter of about 3.5 km, \nis located centrally between two of the Palaeogene dykes. The third set of features are found \nin the hanging wall of the Carmel Head Thrust in the north. They appear as a series of quasi-\nlinear magnetic highs that splay into, and terminate at, the fault location. The structures \nappear to have a finite spatial extent (i.e. offshore, to the north) and possess considerable \ninternal structure when examined in detail. \n\u00a0\u00a0\n3.4 Initial comparison of the data sets \n3.4.1\u00a0Cultural\u00a0interference\u00a0\nA feature of the HiRES magnetic data sets acquired across onshore UK is the degree of \ncultural interference that exists, largely as high-wavenumber and isolated perturbations to the \ndata. The enhanced cultural interference is a result of the low survey height (required by the \nadditional geophysical measurements) in combination with the 200 m flight line separation \nand the fact that the UK has a high population density across most of our survey areas.  \nThe degree of cultural interference can be examined by applying the analytic signal transform \n(Roest et al. 1992) to the data sets. The analytic signal (AS) applied to gridded observations \nof the total magnetic field (T) is defined as: \n)1..(......................................................................\n222\n\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\uf02b\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\uf02b\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\uf03d\nz\nT\ny\nT\nx\nTAS  \nwhere T is the magnetic field. The AS, or total gradient, is defined by derivatives in all 3 \ndimensions and is sensitive to high-order wavenumber gradients in the data. The analytic \nsignal obtained for the two data sets within the HiRES survey polygon are shown as shaded-\nrelief images in Figures 5a (GSGB) and 5b (HiRES).  Identical procedures have been applied \nto both data sets and shading is from the NE. The total gradient content of the two datasets is \nquite distinct with the lower resolution GSGB data displaying some gridding artefacts at the \n500 m interval used. Although NW-SE dyke features are highlighted by the shading angle, \nthe HiRES data set is seen to contain a plethora of isolated and clustered gradients that are \nlikely to be associated with cultural interference.  \nPage\u00a012\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMagnetic deculturing techniques that combine manual and semi-automatic procedures have \nbeen examined and applied to some of the HiRES data sets (Cuss 2003; Lahti et al. 2007).  \nHere we use data that has had no deculturing applied apart from the removal and resampling \nof a large amplitude response from an extensive (industrial units extending over 1 km) \naluminium smelting works, shown as an infilled diamond shape in Figure 5b. Modern high \nresolution airborne magnetic surveys are typically synonymous with accuracy; however when \nacquired in the UK the accuracy (of the geological signal) may be compromised by cultural \nartefacts.  Due to these limitations, unless carefully controlled and lengthy deculturing is \nattempted, the use of high order derivatives in the processing of these data is typically \navoided. \nThree other features are also labelled in Figure 5 and are worthy of note. North of the inner \nfault line of the Carmel Head Thrust (CH), the magnetic gradients observed in the HiRES \ndata (Fig. 5b) are largely absent in the GSGB data set (Fig. 5a). This is a direct result of the \ninadequate sampling across the area as is evident from Figure 3. In the area of superimposed \nultrabasic and dyke anomalies (Feature 2) the gradient content of the GSGB data set (Fig. 5a) \nis particularly poor. The square symbol in Figure 5b notes a strong response from the direct \noverflight of a marine vessel. This forms an instance of a single isolated cultural perturbation. \nThese, and similar instances of cultural interference, can be routinely identified in modern \nsurveys with the assistance of a downward-looking video that provides detailed and \ncontinuous images of the  flight path linked to the survey database (Lahti et al. 2007; \nLev\u00e4niemi et al. 2009). \n3.4.2\u00a0Spectral\u00a0content\u00a0\nThe consideration of the information contained in the analytic signal provides an assessment \nof the high wavenumber gradient content of the data sets. The existing GSGB airborne data \nset was limited to a rectangle of 110 x 135 km and a data grid constructed at a uniform \ninterval of 500 m. The Anglesey HiRES survey data is contained within an area of 44.6 x \n35.25 km and was gridded at a uniform interval of 50 m. Since a number of magnetic \nprocessing procedures take place in the spectral wavenumber domain, it is natural to first \nsummarise the two data sets in this framework. Figure 6a shows the radially\/azimuthally-\naveraged (2D) power spectra of the two data sets discussed above. The lowest wavenumber is \ndetermined by the number of cells within the grid while the highest wavenumber represents \nPage\u00a013\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\nthe Nyquist sampling interval (e.g. 100 m and 1 km for the HiRES and the GSGB data sets, \nrespectively). \nThe higher energy content of the HiRES data is evident across the whole spectrum. When \nmagnetic spectra are examined from a framework of spectral shape, Spector & Grant (1970) \nshowed that a statistical population of magnetic sources at depth h would generate a straight \nline slope of -4\u03c0h, on a plot of the natural logarithm of energy against wavenumber. From this \nperspective, the energy spectra shown in Figure 6a indicate that only 2 to 3 such lines are \nrequired by simpler regional data while the HiRES spectrum requires at least 4. The \ncomparison is indicative of the greater information content of the HiRES data set even though \na much smaller area is sampled.  \nThe spectral slopes observed can be used to provide first-order estimates of source depth h. \nThese continuous estimates, derived from a 5-point averaging of the spectral slopes are \nshown in Figure 6b. The low wavenumber content of the regional GSGB data indicates \npotential sources at 17 and 12 km while for the equivalent HiRES data the estimated source \ndepths are reduced to significantly shallower levels of 5.8 and 3 km. Between wavelengths of \n10 km and 1 km the GSGB depth estimates display a high degree of variance, indicating a \nsignificant noise level. \n3.4.3\u00a0Comparison\u00a0along\u00a0profile\u00a0A\u2010A\u2019\u00a0\nThe TMI anomaly data resolved along the profile A-A\u2019 (Figures 3 and 4) are shown in Figure \n7a. The vertical offset between the two data sets is due to the different IGRF reference fields \nused. Along the 28 km profile, the GSGB data display a range of 212 nT that results from the \nregional trend observed. In contrast, the HiRES data display a range of 350 nT that results \nfrom the higher wavenumber variations across the profile. The first 4 negative anomalies are \nassociated with linear features mapped in Figure 4 and interpreted as Palaeogene dykes. The \nthird and largest negative anomaly is that labelled 1 in Figures 3 and 4.  \nThe profile A-A\u2019 is approximately normal to the strike of the magnetic variations. The form \nof the dyke anomalies when allowance is made for the regional trend is consistent.  The \noffshore magnetic dykes to the NW of Anglesey have been discussed by Wright et al. (1971) \nand by Kirton & Donato (1985).  Kirton & Donato (1985) undertook an extensive modelling \nof the magnetic responses of Palaeogene dykes across the UK. Two of the dykes off Anglesey \nwere modelled using marine magnetic profiles. Although the trial-and-error modelling was \nPage\u00a014\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\nnecessarily non-unique, depths of ~50 m and ~200 m to the upper surfaces of the structures \nwere obtained. In addition, the total magnetisation vectors required to fit the observed \nresponses were within 20\u00b0 of the vertical (i.e. within 20\u00b0 of the totally reversed magnetisation \ndirection). This is significant since some of the processing and interpretation procedures \ndiscussed below relate to the detection and definition of isolated magnetic anomalies for \nwhich the total magnetisation vectors are assumed to be normal (i.e. +90\u00b0 in the magnetic \nRTP response) or reversed (-90\u00b0 in the magnetic RTP response). \n4 PROCESSING TECHNIQUES \nIt is evident from the data presented that shallow and deeper magnetic sources are \ndirectionally distinct and are close to being orthogonal. One of the significant features of the \nPalaeogene dyke swarm is the NW-SE regional scale persistence in direction. They can be \ntraced across the Irish Sea and into and through Northern Ireland (Beamish & Schofield, \n2010). The NE-SW directional trends observed in the magnetic data at longer wavelengths \nare consistent with the tectonic and geological framework summarised in Figure 2. This \ndirectional dependence is exploited in the structural assessments considered below.  \nAzimuthal (directional) filters have been applied in the wavenumber domain to selectively \nremove signal and noise along specified directions. To avoid introducing artefacts, we use a \nsmooth cosine function of degree 2 having a gain of unity at the chosen azimuth and a gain of \nzero in the orthogonal direction.  \nSpatial derivatives have a well-established role in the interpretation of potential field data \nfrom both ground-based and airborne surveys. There exists a range of processing procedures \nand filters, largely relating to vertical and horizontal derivatives and their combinations that \nperform as enhanced mapping functions when applied to the basic data sets (Blakely, 1995; \nCooper & Cowan, 2006). The methods are all based on the use of the spatial derivatives of \nthe data. The source parameters that may be estimated include the lateral and the upper \nvertical boundaries of the source region (Blakely & Simpson, 1986; Cooper & Cowan, 2008). \nOther methods such as Euler deconvolution (Thompson 1982; Reid et al. 1990) also exist for \nthe estimation of the location and depth of the source. All the methods entail a number of \nsimplying assumptions since the magnetic bodies (e.g. contacts, dykes, pipes) comprise \nidealised geometries. \n \nPage\u00a015\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4.1 The Tilt Derivative (TDR) \nStructural information in the data sets is first examined here using the Tilt Derivative (TDR) \nas described by Miller & Singh (1994). The tilt derivative or tilt angle is defined as the \narctangent of the ratio of a vertical to a combined (total) horizontal derivative: \n \n)2.....(............................................................\n)\/()\/(\n\/tan\n22\n1\n\uf0fa\uf0fa\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\uf0ea\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0b6\uf0b6\uf02b\uf0b6\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\uf0b6\uf03d \uf02d\nyTxT\nzTTDR\n  \n \nwhere T is the magnetic or gravity field.\n \nThe amplitude range of the dimensionless ratio is restricted to the range \u03c0\/2 to - \u03c0\/2 (or 90\u00b0 to \n-90\u00b0) by virtue of the arctan function. The TDR acts as an Automatic Gain Control (AGC) \nfilter when applied to the field observations. The TDR thus responds equally to both shallow \nand deep sources. Summaries of the behaviour of tilt derivatives in the case of magnetic field \ndata are provided by Fairhead et al. (2004) and Cooper & Cowan (2006). The function \ntypically allows a normalisation of both shallow and deep sources in broadband TMI anomaly \ndata but here we also apply it to anomaly data that have been subjected to matched spectral \nfiltering (see below). \nExisting modelling of the TDR response to isolated magnetic bodies (e.g. Fairhead et al. \n2004; Verduzco et al. 2004; Cooper & Cowan 2006; Salem et al. 2008) indicate that the TDR \nis positive when over the source, it passes through zero when over (or near) the edge of the \nsource, where the vertical derivative is zero and the horizontal derivative is a maximum, and \nis negative outside the source region. It should be noted however that the modelling of \nmagnetisation vectors is typically confined to azimuths of between 0\u00b0 and +90\u00b0 so that the \nsources considered (e.g. step basement, blocks and dykes) are effectively normally \nmagnetised. In addition to the edge detection functionality, Verduzco et al. (2004) and Salem \net al. (2008) note an approximate depth mapping functionality of the TDR in relation to the \ntop of an isolated source region. Using the TDR mapping interval between 45\u00b0 and -45\u00b0, with \nthe zero defining the edge location, these authors indicate that the source depth is roughly \nequivalent to half the distance between the 45\u00b0 and -45\u00b0 contours. \nPage\u00a016\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt is possible, as in our study, to encounter both positively and negatively magnetised \nstructural features. To confirm the anticipated behaviour of the TDR response in this case, a \nmodelling study was undertaken using two concealed dyke features, one with normal \nmagnetic polarity and one with reversed polarity. The data sampling interval along a profile \nperpendicular to the strike is 25 m. The magnetic anomaly across the two features is shown in \nFigure 8a.  \nEach dyke structure has a width of 75 m with an upper surface at a depth of 30 m. The depth \nextent of each feature is effectively infinite. The centre of the positively magnetised dyke \n(+90\u00b0) is located at 662.5 m along profile while the negatively magnetised dyke (-90\u00b0) is at \n4337.5 m. The magnetic susceptibility of each body is 0.05 SI and the background has zero \nmagnetic susceptibility. As anticipated, the magnetic anomalies due to the two features are \ninverted. A similar inversion is generated when the TDR of this data set is considered (Fig. \n7b). The half-width of the TDR response between +45\u00b0 and -45\u00b0 is 35 m in both cases. If \nhowever a mapping of the TDR response is conducted, it is clear that the interpretation of the \nprimary mapping intervals of the TDR response (e.g. the interval from +45\u00b0 to +90\u00b0 shown in \nred in Fig. 7b) must take into account the relative polarity information that is omitted from the \nTDR response. This additional relative amplitude information is contained in, for example, \nthe magnetic intensity field and must be consulted in the interpretation of the TDR response.   \n4.2 Matched band-pass spectral filters \nIn order to compare the information on magnetic basement contained in the GSGB and \nHiRES data sets it has been necessary to perform spectral filtering. The starting point for this \nprocedure is the spectral content previously summarised in Figure 6. In order to examine the \nlonger wavelength components in the data we use a technique referred to as matched band-\npass spectral filtering that extends the original procedures described by Spector & Grant \n(1970) and Syberg (1972). Here we follow the procedures described by Phillips (2001).  In \nthe simple case, it may be assumed that the observed field is the sum of the regional \n(basement) field, a residual (shallow) field and a noise component. The more general model \ntakes into account the shape of the observed spectrum and allows for a general multi-layer \ncase and considers the effects of sources at a number of distinct levels. The physical \nsignificance of the number of layers and their thicknesses always remains questionable given \nthe equivalence inherent in such a modelling procedure (Pedersen, 1991).  \nPage\u00a017\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUsing a graphical procedure, the plot of the logarithm of energy against wavenumber is used \nto establish a number of straight-line segments (a matched filter model) whose slopes are then \noptimised to minimise the residual spectrum between that observed and that calculated from \nthe model layers.  The layered model generally terminates in a magnetic half-space that \nprovides a linear spectrum at all wavenumbers. Here we assume that that this half-space \nforms an estimate of magnetic basement and compare the results obtained using the two data \nsets. \nThe depths obtained by the analysis are treated as approximate and the procedure is \nessentially used to obtain the distribution of magnetic source bodies responsible for the \nlongest wavelengths. The source locations and depths of the sources are then investigated \nusing the TDR response, as described above, and Euler deconvolution as described below. \n4.3 Euler Deconvolution  \nLi (2003) provides a useful summary of the many different methods used for estimating \nmagnetic depth. The review also summarises the potential strengths and weakness of each \nprocedure. Here we use located 3D Euler deconvolution which is based on Euler\u2019s \nhomogeneity equation (Thompson 1982; Reid et al. 1990): \n)3........(..................................................)()()( 000 Tz\nTzz\ny\nTyy\nx\nTxx \uf068\uf02d\uf03d\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\uf02d\uf02b\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\uf02d\uf02b\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\uf02d\n \nwhere \u03b7 is a measure of the fall-off rate of the magnetic anomaly field (T). The relationship is \nused to generate a series of linear equations that can be solved using a least-squares approach.  \nAs defined by equation (3), the procedure is based on first-order vertical and horizontal \nderivatives. \nThe technique uses the anomaly field, measured at (x, y, z) and determines a source position \n(x0, y0, z0), for a single source of given type.  The source type is expressed in the form of a \nstructural index (\u03b7) which is a gauge of the rate of change of the field with distance.  The \nsystem holds not only for the TMI anomaly field but also for its derivatives, and can be \nextended to handle more complex derived grids such as the Analytical Signal (Li, 2003) or \nthe Tilt Derivative, where the structural index is determined along with an estimate of the \nsource position (Salem et al. 2008).  However, the use of higher order derivatives means \nPage\u00a018\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\nthese methods are susceptible to any noise in the data and only first-order derivatives are used \nhere.  \nThe magnetic data is studied using a located Euler scheme which avoids excessive numbers \nof solutions. Instead initial locations (x, y, z) are determined independently from a suitable \nfirst derivative property which defines inflections (e.g. peaks or troughs) in the data. Data at \nthese initial locations, together with the calculated window sizes, are then used in the standard \nEuler deconvolution procedure. In our case, in order to trace depth solutions of the reversely \nmagnetised dykes, troughs in the first vertical derivative of the anomaly data were used to \nprovide the initial locations. In the case of magnetic basement, peaks in the magnitude of the \ntotal horizontal gradient provided the initial locations. Our Euler deconvolution analysis is \nthus restricted to defining reversely magnetised dykes at shallow depths and positively \nmagnetised magnetic basement. In both cases the data is conditioned using combinations of \nazimuthal and\/or matched band pass filters with fixed structural indices (\u03b7) of 1 (for dykes) \nand 2 (for contacts) applied. \n4.4  Terracing operator \nThe terracing operator was originally described by Cordell & McCafferty (1989). The \nterracing operator is applied to potential field data to produce regions of constant field \namplitude that are separated by sharp boundaries. The method involves a filtering operation \nthat gradually increases the slopes of the first horizontal derivatives while simultaneously \nlevelling the field between gradients (e.g.  Cooper & Cowan, 2009). The procedure is \ngenerally considered to be an aid to geological interpretation (Cordell & McCafferty, 1989). \nHere the procedure is intended to provide a geologically-orientated map of shallow basement \nmagnetisation as discussed later. \n \n5 APPLICATION TO SURVEY DATA (SHALLOW DYKE STRUCTURE) \n5.1 The GSGB data \nThe TDR response of the vintage GSGB TMI RTP data (Figure 3) is shown in Figure 9a. The \nTDR response has been contoured in 45\u00b0 intervals with red and blue colours representing \npositive and negative responses, respectively. The negative interval from -45\u00b0 to -90\u00b0 is \nshown in white following the discussion above. The linear negative features with a NW-SE \nPage\u00a019\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\ntrend that we would associate with the Palaeogene dyke swarm are superimposed on longer \nwavelength (deeper) positive responses that appear to trend  NE-SW, orthogonal to the dyke \ndirection. \nThe magnetic data in the spatial domain (e.g. Fig. 9a) were subjected to a directional \n(azimuthal) cosine filter to pass the magnetic components in a direction 135 degrees (i.e. the \nNW-SE direction). The TDR response was then obtained using the filtered data set. A contour \nplot of the resulting TDR response is shown in Figure 9b with only the negative response \nbetween values of -45\u00b0 and -90\u00b0 outlined. This TDR response region outlines the maximum \nnegative excursions (i.e. the responses that would, potentially, be associated with the centres \nof reversely magnetised anomalies). Obviously features with intermediate, or no, strike \ndirections will be distorted by the directional filtering applied so the mapping provided in \nFigure 9b must be interpreted alongside the information already presented. In practice a suite \nof TMI derivative maps (not shown here) are also used to arrive at a greater understanding of \nthe data characteristics. It can be seen that the directional filtering has suppressed all the \ngradients (edges) with a NE-SE (45\u00b0) component observed in Figure 9a. The main \nPalaeogene dyke swarm is observed to the SW of a central NW-SE axis through the HiRES \nsurvey area shown. Individual dykes are identified through partial linear continuity since gaps \nmay exist due to data sampling limitations and\/or along strike changes in depth and\/or \nmagnetisation strength. The larger area zones of negative response are associated with low \ngradient areas and are interpreted as distorted noise levels given the azimuthal filtering that \nhas been applied. The limitations of the gridding can also be observed since these effects are \namplified in the TDR response.  \n\u00a0\n5.2 The HiRES data \nSince there is significant interference from cultural features, the HiRES TMI RTP data were \nfirst upward continued to a height of 100 m to attenuate the highest wavenumbers. This has \nonly a marginal effect (a slight increase) on the width of the features in the TDR response. \nThe TDR response of the unrotated data is shown in Figure 10. The TDR response has again \nbeen contoured in 45\u00b0 intervals with red and blue colours representing positive and negative \nresponses, respectively. As previously, the negative interval from -45\u00b0 to -90\u00b0 is shown in \nwhite. Previously, some of the positively magnetised large amplitude features were discussed \nPage\u00a020\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\nin relation to the TMI data shown in Figure 4. They can now be re-examined in relation to the \nmapping of the +45\u00b0 to -45\u00b0 TDR interval providing approximate depth estimates for vertical \nand isolated contacts. The zone of ultrabasic serpentinite (feature 2 in Fig 4) is partially \nmapped (i.e. at outcrop) at its western end. TDR depth estimates are in the range -20 (i.e. \nabove ground due to inherent inaccuracies) to 20 m below ground level corresponding to a \nshallow, partially concealed body. Offshore, the central positive anomaly (feature 3 in Fig. 4) \nhas an estimated depth of about 100 m below sea level. The major positively magnetised \nbodies in the hanging wall of the Carmel Head shear zone (CH in Figure 4) are unidentified \non geological maps and the TDR depth estimates again suggest near-surface bodies. \nA contour plot of the directionally (135\u00b0) filtered HiRES TDR response is shown in Figure 11 \nwith only the negative response between values of -45\u00b0 and -90\u00b0 outlined in blue. These are \noverlaid on the equivalent rotated TDR response of the GSGB data (from Figure 9b) in the \nimmediate vicinity of the HiRES survey. The latter response is outlined in grey to allow \ncomparisons to be made. In a broad sense the good correspondence between the two data sets \nin mapping the main set of dykes to the SW of a central NW-SE axis is evident. The HiRES \ndata inevitably provide both a greater continuity and better resolved location of the features \n(e.g. Feature 1). Dyke displacements, particularly across the Berw fault (see BF, Figure 4) are \nevident as discussed by Bevins et al. (1996) but the detail of these, and other, displacement \nfeatures are now well defined and circled in Figure 11. Two other, more subtle, displacements \nacross one dyke indentified by the HiRES data are outlined with squares. The observations \nhave a significance since the interpretation of the previously known dyke offsets in terms of \nCenozoic fault movement is disputed (Maddock et al. 1997). \nTo the NE of the central NW-SE axis, the HiRES data indicate a variety of parallel NW-SE \nstriking zones that have the potential to be interpreted as concealed Palaeogene dykes. These \nadditional features are closer to the limits of detection than those discussed above and their \ndefinition is more susceptible to cultural interference. Many of the NW-SE trending features \nextend over many kilometres and possess the same character as that of the established (i.e. \neasier to detect) dykes. The most obvious example is labelled TB in Figure 11. This feature is \nprobably the Traeth Bychan dyke and can be detected entering the vicinity of the former \ncopper mine of Parys Mountain at its northwestern limit.  The current mapping of identified \nand outcropping Palaeogene dykes at a scale of 1:50k is shown in red for comparison. In \nPage\u00a021\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\nterms of the existing outcrop mapping of dykes (i.e. red zones in Figure 11), there is only one \nisolated occurrence that is not identified in the processed HiRES magnetic data. \nThe variations in the unrotated TDR response along profile A-A\u2019 for both GSGB (sampled at \n500 m) and HiRES (sampled at 50 m) data are shown in Figure 7b. Negative responses \nassociated with the HiRES data are shown with infill. At profile distances less than ~20,000 \nm, we are concerned with the behaviour of the negative variations in the TDR response. Here \nthe GSGB data indicate three minima in the TDR response while the HiRES data indicate \nseven minima that may be associated with dykes. The location of the centre of the strongest \nresponse (Feature 1) differs by ~ 1 km in the two estimates. The results also indicate that \nwhile the GSGB data may be used to partially map a number of high-wavenumber structures, \nparticularly those possessing linear continuity, the HiRES data provide well-constrained \nlocations of the dykes. \n5.3 Euler deconvolution of shallow structure \nGiven the behaviour of the GSGB data and their spatial derivatives, the Euler deconvolution \nof shallow structure is restricted to the HiRES azimuthally filtered data set. The located Euler \nsolution results for these data are plotted in Figure 12. As noted previously a structural index \n(\u03b7) of unity, appropriate to dyke structure, was used. The solutions shown are selected based \non their estimated uncertainties in depth and position (x, y).  These restricted solutions have \nan error (standard deviation) of less than 10% in each of these error estimates. Depths are \nreferenced to the level of the ground surface assuming a constant flying elevation of 56 m. \nAlso shown in Figure 12 are the TDR results between the intervals from -45\u00b0 to -90\u00b0 from the \nHiRES data shown previously. It can be seen that the TDR and Euler location estimates \ndisplay a high degree of correspondence along the quasi-linear features we would associate \nwith reversely magnetised dykes.  Continuous zones where both processing methods provide \ncollocated results reinforces the interpretation of some of the more marginal features. As \nnoted previously the results obtained to the north of the Carmel Head fault (CH) should be \ndisregarded in the assessment of the dyke swarm.  \nThe Euler estimated depth to magnetic source along the Palaeogene dyke swarm displays a \nsignificant degree of variation along individual lineaments.  The scatter in depth estimates is \ntypical of Euler solutions. Figure 12 shows the 8221 solutions obtained by the Euler analysis, \nafter winnowing based on accuracy. If we select only the solutions along the quasi-linear \nPage\u00a022\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\ntrends of negatively magnetised features, we can reduce the solutions to a subset of 1285. \nThis subset has a median depth of 44 m with first and third quartiles at depths of 26 and 66 m, \nrespectively. Some correlation with outcropping dykes is observed and the scattering is \npossibly a consequence of both significant lateral variation in depth and considerable \nweathering effects on the volcanic intrusives. It is also worth highlighting the offset between \nthe negative peaks in the TDR results and the Euler solutions in the north of the survey area \nwhere positively magnetised intrusions are responsible for the anomalies. \n\u00a0\n6 APPLICATION TO SURVEY DATA (MAGNETIC BASEMENT) \nIt is evident that in both the GSGB and HiRES data sets, the near-surface anomalies discussed \nin Section 4 possess significant amplitudes and thus potentially interfere with the longer \nwavelength, deeper features in the data sets. After utilising the approximate orthogonality in \nthe data between the shallow and deep features the magnetic basement characteristics in both \ndata sets are examined using matched spectral filtering. The basement features associated \nwith the HiRES data, being relatively shallow, retain an influence from the shallow dykes \neven after azimuthal processing to minimise their influence has been performed. \n6.1 The GSGB data \nAs noted previously the regional data spectrum can be adequately modelled using 2 magnetic \nlayers above a half-space. A matched filter analysis of the data indicated the first 2 layer \ndepths were 540 m (below the observational height of ~300 m) and 1920 m. The magnetic \nbasement was estimated to be at a depth of about 13 km. The information content of the first \n2 layers appears noise-like and not structurally significant.  Removal of the spectral \ncomponents of the first two layers provided the TMI magnetic anomaly basement map shown \nas a colour image in Figure 13. A high amplitude positive centre is defined below the \nSnowdon massif to the SE of the survey area. In order to define the source location and depth, \nthe TDR response of the data are shown as contour lines with an interval of 45\u00b0. The zero \ncontour would again outline body edges subject to the usual assumptions. The trend of the \nmain anomaly edge SSW and parallel to the coast is significant given the occurrence of \nsimilar tectono-metamorphic terranes on Anglesey and on the Llyn Peninsula that is located \nin the southern-most centre of the area (Gibbons & Hor\u00e1k, 1990). Offshore a NE-SW \ntrending, lower amplitude feature is observed that may be associated with the Mid-Irish Sea \nPage\u00a023\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUplift (Jackson et al. 1995). Depths to the top of the main body estimated from the TDR \ninterval from -45\u00b0 to +45\u00b0 range from about 10.5 to 12 km below the observational height.  \n3D Euler solutions were investigated using the magnetic basement features shown in Figure \n13. Located Euler deconvolution was again performed on the data in an effort to locate \nmagnetic contacts.  In the case of basement features, the initial locations were derived from \npeaks in the total horizontal gradient of the anomaly field.  The solutions, determined with a \nstructural index of zero (i.e. a contact) are also shown in Figure 13 using 4 depth ranges \nbetween 6 and 14 km. The results are a subset of the total solutions obtained. The results \nshown provided an error estimate of <10% in the Euler x,y,z  solution locations. Depths are \nreferenced to the level of the ground surface assuming a constant flying elevation of 300 m. \nThe solutions display a high degree of spatial correspondence with the zero value of the TDR \nresponse and serve to reinforce confidence in the edge location of the deep magnetic feature. \nThe third Euler depth range between 10 and 12 km corresponds to the TDR contact depth \nestimate noted previously. The depth solutions also display some significant trends; the \nsolutions along the western edge exhibit shallower depths (e.g. 8 to 10 km) than the \nnorthernmost boundary depth estimates which exceed 10 km. The boundary feature is deepest \nat the convergence point of the two trends. \n6.2 The HiRES data \nThe estimation of magnetic basement features in the HiRES data is more challenging. The \nspectral content of the HiRES data (e.g. Fig. 6) indicates a reduced depth to basement \ncompared to that of the GSGB baseline data. In the HiRES data, both the amplitudes and \nnumber of the Palaeogene dykes interfere with the resolution of the longer wavelength, \nbasement features. In these circumstances, it has been necessary to process the data using \ncombined azimuthal and matched-filtering procedures. It has already been noted that \ngeological, fault and long wavelength magnetic features across Anglesey display a \npredominant trend direction of +45\u00b0 from North. This direction is orthogonal to the NW-SE \nstrike direction of the dykes. It is therefore possible to minimise the contribution of the dykes \nby applying a directional filter. The magnetic data in the space domain (shown in Figure 4) \nwere subjected to a directional cosine filter to pass the magnetic components in a direction of \n+45\u00b0. It is recognised that a number of non-dyke features, particularly those at intermediate \nwavelengths,  in the data set (Figure 4) will be distorted by the filtering; however only the \nPage\u00a024\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\nregionally continuous large scale features i.e. those associated with basement, are the subject \nof this analysis.  \nThe azimuthally filtered data were analysed using a matched band spectral filtering procedure \nas previously discussed. The matched filter analysis indicated the data spectrum could be \nmodelled using 3 magnetic layers above a half space. The layer depths obtained by the \nanalysis were 83, 173, 646 and 2708 m below the observational height of 56 m. Removal of \nthe spectral components of the first 3 layers thus provided a TMI magnetic basement estimate \nat a depth below surface of 2652 m. This depth is clearly considerably less than that obtained \nfrom the regional data and, as previously noted, relates to the high information content of the \nHiRES data at relatively shallow depths. \nThe TMI basement features are shown in Figure 14a with the 1:650k mapping of fault lines \nfor reference. The basement anomaly response can be compared with the full spectrum \nanomaly response shown in Figure 4. Two areas of potentially distorted localised magnetic \nbasement features are circled; these relate to features 2 and 3 identified in Figure 4. Two main \nregional basement magnetic highs are identified with the zone to the SE of the Berw Fault \nbeing the most prominent. This feature probably extends beyond both edges of the survey \narea. The additional central magnetic high zone shows a close association with the Coedana \nComplex granite and gneiss. The geophysical information of the first, more highly \nmagnetised body to the SE of the Berw Fault, is of relevance since the significance of the \nshear zone, interpreted as a terrane boundary by Gibbons (1990) and Gibbons & Hor\u00e1k \n(1990) is disputed (Strachan et al. 2007).  \nThe more central, and less pronounced, basement high appears confined within the survey \narea and displays a correspondence with the outcrop of the Coedana Complex granite and \ngneisses. The basement anomaly features shown in Figure 14a have been analysed using the \nterracing operator of Cordell & McCafferty (1989) and discussed previously in the section on \nprocessing techniques. The procedure used here is described by Phillips (1992).  The result of \napplying the terracing operator is shown in Figure 14b with only the high amplitude values \nabove 20 nT displayed using a 6 colour scheme. The transformation of the original magnetic \nvariation data shown in Figure 14a to sharp boundary contacts is evident. Also shown in \nFigure 14b are stippled zones that denote the outcrop of the Coedana (and other) granites. It is \nclear that the central zone of higher magnetisation is closely associated with this complex, \nPage\u00a025\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\ncurrently interpreted as a volcanic-arc granite generated in the late Precambrian Avalonian \nsubduction system (Gibbons & Hor\u00e1k, 1996). The northerly trending fault (labelled A in \nFigure 14b) appears to have controlled the development of the magnetic basement structure. \nIt is worth noting that this interpretation is only achieved by the application of the terracing \noperator to the data in Figure 14a (compare Figures 14a and 14b). \n\u00a0\n6.3 Tilt Derivative and Euler deconvolution of shallow basement structure \nIn order to estimate shallow basement source depths, TDR response estimation together with \nlocated Euler deconvolution were applied to the shallow basement magnetic response of \nFigure 14a. The same procedures and parameters that were used in the deep basement study \nof the GSGB data were applied again. The results of the study are summarised in Figure 15 \nwith the TDR response shown as contour lines at 45\u00b0 intervals and the Euler depth estimates \nas colour symbols in 5 ranges extending to a depth of 3 km. Depths, in this case, are \nreferenced to ground surface assuming a constant flying elevation of 56 m. The outline of the \ncontours > 20 nT obtained by the terracing procedure (Figure 14b) is shown in grey, for \nreference. \nUsing the zero contour of the TDR response as a reference for source edge location, the two \nbasement magnetic highs, discussed above, are outlined. An additional source boundary, \ntrending NE-SW across the NW area of the survey is also defined; this feature (labelled A in \nFigure 15) is only partially resolved in the previous maps (Figures 14a,b) that used only the \nmagnetic field data. The TDR zero response of this feature is highly linear as confirmed by \nthe Euler solutions; the body edge becomes progressively deeper to the NE where it \nterminates in the hanging wall of the Carmel Head thrust. The Euler solutions can be seen to \ntrack the trace of the TDR zero contour thus providing reinforcement to the geophysical \ninterpretation. This is illustrated in detail in the associated behaviour of both TDR and Euler \ndepths in the vicinity of the northern edge of the central magnetic high associated with the \ngranite. A relatively narrow zone is defined by the TDR contours in the interval from -45\u00b0 to \n+45\u00b0 and the associated estimated depth to contact is ~1000 m. The corresponding Euler \ndepth estimates range from 500 to 1500 m with a central mean close to the TDR estimate. \nFurther to the NE, the TDR edge location contours display an expansion to a wider zone with \nPage\u00a026\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\nan associated depth estimate of about 2200 m and here the Euler solutions consistently \nprovide depth estimates of over 2000 m. \n \n7 CONCLUSIONS \nThe study has considered airborne magnetic data sets of relevance to the geophysical \nassessment of UK geology and its application to mapping and interpretation. The study uses \nexisting national scale, baseline UK magnetic data across Anglesey in relation to one of a \nnumber of modern high resolution data sets. The analysis conducted has focussed on the \ninformation content of both data sets in relation to both shallow and deep magnetic structure. \nThe geological setting of the case study area is both complex and controversial and a \ngeological remapping project of the area is currently underway. \nThe analysis procedures applied to both data sets have used and compared the Tilt Derivative \nand 3D Located Euler Deconvolution to identify both location and depth (to upper surfaces) \nof isolated magnetic bodies. Since both techniques are subject to assumptions and errors, we \nhave found that the dual assessment provides a reinforced and more robust interpretation of \nthe data. We have also noted the potential pitfall in the isolated use of the Tilt Derivative \nwhen, as here, both normally and reversely magnetised bodies are present.  \nCultural perturbations, so prevalent in the modern HiRES data sets are rare in the GSGB data \ndue to much higher survey elevation. The cultural artefact content of the HiRES low altitude \nsurveys has been briefly outlined. Modern high resolution airborne magnetic surveys are \nsynonymous with accuracy; when acquired over onshore UK however, the accuracy (of the \ngeological signal) is routinely compromised by cultural perturbations.  The two largest \nHiRES data sets (North Midlands and Northern Ireland, Figure 1) have been decultured by \nsemi-automatic procedures. Typically about 9% of the data is rejected or flagged and \ninterpolation procedures are applied through data gaps (Lahti et al. 2007). The analysis \nconducted here has used a largely non-decultured data set. The analysis demonstrates that \nsuccessful processing and interpretation can be carried out on data that have not been \nsystematically corrected for the non-geological perturbations. \nInevitably the baseline data is limited in resolving features < 1 km in scale. However the \ncomparisons reveal that a broad assessment of linear shallow features (e.g. dykes largely \nPage\u00a027\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\nconfined to the upper 200m) can be achieved. The precise limitations of the baseline data are \nrevealed when the HiRES data are used in a joint assessment. Both the locations, widths and \npresence of lower amplitude features, including offsets, may be either misrepresented or \nomitted by the vintage data.  The highest wavenumber noise content of the GSGB data set is \nassociated with the intrinsic variable sampling (e.g. Figure 3) and subsequent aliasing of \nfeatures when data are gridded and spatial derivatives are calculated (e.g. Figure 5a). Spatial \nsampling limitations will vary with selected location across the UK (e.g. BGS, 1998). In the \nworst case, potentially resolvable features will be omitted due to sampling variations. A \nparticular instance where the limited and variable sampling of the GSGB data set fails to \nregister significant magnetic variations can be seen across the Carmel Head Thrust zone \n(Figures 3, 4 and 5). \nThe high precision of the HiRES data in relation to defining the locations of concealed dykes \nand their approximate depths has been noted. The precise determination of dyke offsets is \nillustrated in Figure 11. The southern-most displacements are those discussed by Bevins et al. \n(1996) and by Maddock et al. (1997) and are associated with locations along the Berw Fault \nzone (circled in Figure 11). Much of the discussion on the evidence, or otherwise, for \nCenozoic sinstral fault movement concerns paleomagnetic dating evidence. We do not wish \nto comment on that here and simply note that the HiRES data have also resolved dyke offsets, \nin the opposing sense, along one of the main dyke structures (square symbols in Figure 11). \nThere are no known faults at the two locations. \nThe resolution capabilities regarding magnetic basement features of the two data sets are \nrelated to their differing spectral content. Perhaps the most significant finding is the lack of \ncoherent magnetic information in the GSGB data set across wavelengths of between ~2 and \n10 km. As demonstrated by the HiRES data set, shallow magnetic basement features exist and \nare of fundamental significance to a geological assessment of the Precambrian terrane \nassemblages across the study area.  According to the analysis conducted, a broad level of \nshallow magnetic basement exists at a depth around 2700 m. Three localised magnetic \nbasement highs are identified across the survey area all with a strong NE-SW trend (Figures \n14 and 15).  The most northerly of these features is only resolved by its southernmost edge. \nThe central body appears to be confined to the landmass although the limited spatial extent of \nthe survey should be recognised. The outline of the source body shows a high degree of \nspatial correspondence with the outcrop of the Coedana granite and gneisses. The body \nPage\u00a028\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\ndisplays a distinct deep (2000 to 3000 m) edge along its northwestern margin approximating \nto the major cataclastic zone (Llyn Traffwill Fault Zone) identified by Gibbons & Hor\u00e1k \n(1990) . The third and most magnetic body extends offshore to the NE and SW. Magnetic \nanomaly values are variable along strike and become most intense in a localised zone in the \nSW (in the vicinity of the village of Dwyran). The edge of the body shows associations with \nthe Berw Fault to the NW and the zone of blueschists (Figure 2) but extends, in a continuous \nfashion, beneath other formations to the NE. The magnetic information confirms the \nsignificance of the Berw Fault as a steep lithological boundary with depths to the upper \nsurface of the body varying between 500 and 1500 m (Figure 15), becoming deepest in the \nsouth-west. \nThe above assessments cannot be achieved using the GSGB baseline data. Equally the HiRES \nsurvey data are limited in any deeper (> 3 km) assessments of magnetic basement structure. It \nhas been demonstrated that the main structural application potential of the baseline data are \nassociated with the assessment of deep (e.g. > 5 km) magnetic basement features that, in this \ncase study, cannot be achieved by the new data.  Using the spectral content of the GSGB data, \nthe depth of the deep magnetic basement is estimated to be about 13 km. A combined analysis \nusing the Tilt Derivative and 3D Euler analysis has refined the location and depth of the main \nstructure across NW Wales. If the features are considered as a single zone of magnetic \nbasement then the centre is clearly located in the vicinity of the Snowdon Massif (Figure 13). \nThis regional high is consistent with the presence of a large deep body of mafic material that \nsupported the genesis of the Ordovician volcanic eruptive sequences.  The NW edge of the \nfeature appears well located at depths of between 10 and 12 km and displays a linear strike \nacross onshore Anglesey. The deep magnetic information suggests that the NW part of \nAnglesey, predominantly the Monian Supergroup, is underlain by weekly magnetic mid-\ncrustal basement. This then appears consistent with the suggestion of van Staal et al. (1998) \nthat the mid-crustal basement forms part of a genuinely separate terrain while the rest of \nAnglesey and North Wales is underlain by magnetic basement characteristic of Eastern \nAvalonia.  \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPage\u00a029\u00a0of\u00a054\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors express their appreciation for the assistance provided by Dave Schofield and Tim \nPharaoh in improving the manuscript.
