This paper outlines a\npreliminary approach to modelling and planning the composition of engineering project\nteams, taking into consideration the skills and capabilities of engineers and the nature of the\nproject work to be undertaken. The approach includes a simple means of identifying\nengineers\u2019 skills and then quantifying their level of capability in these skills. Subsequently,\nthe approach uses a genetic algorithm along with a task-to-engineer allocation strategy\nto establish how best to utilize the mix of skills and capabilities of the team of engineers\nassigned to the project under consideration. The approach also provides a means of\nidentifying imbalances or shortfalls in skill and capability within a team, and the formulation\nof an appropriate development strategy to redress\/overcome them. An application of the\napproach to an industrial case study is presented, which led to significant potential\nreductions in expected project duration and labour cost. These potential reductions could\nbe achieved by appropriately modelling engineers\u2019 skills and capabilities, and redressing the\nimbalance within the team through proposed changes to its composition.\nKeywords: project management, engineering teams, engineer skills and capabilities\n1 INTRODUCTION\nLarge engineering projects are becoming increasingly\nmore challenging to manage as they involve numer-\nous interdependent tasks of varying complexity, and\nmany engineers with a range of skills and level of\ncapability in these skills. Engineering projects on\nsuch a scale require sufficient expertise in a broad\nset of skills to avoid extended durations and increased\ncosts. Pemberton-Billing et al. [1] note that in many\nindustries, due to the size of projects and the range\nof skills required, the engineering team is an essential\ncomponent of most successful projects; i.e. bringing\ntogether individuals with the correct balance of skills\nis viewed as being fundamental to successfully com-\npleting the complex range of tasks involved in pro-\njects. Indeed, a statistical analysis performed by\nOdusami et al. [2] showed that a significant relation-\nship exists between project team composition and\noverall project performance. Similarly, Farr-Wharton\n[3] conducted a study highlighting the contribution\nindividuals make, and their assembly into talented\nand balanced teams, as important factors to the\nsuccessful completion of projects.\nIn the current knowledge-based economy, em-\nployee skills and abilities, also referred to as human\ncapital, are fast becoming an organization\u2019s most\nvaluable asset [4, 5], a key driving force in economic\ndevelopment [6\u20138], and a source of competitive\nadvantage [9\u201311]. Elias and Scarbrough [12] state\nthat \u2018in particular, emphasis has been placed on\nthe importance of a company\u2019s human capital \u2013\nthe value-creating skills, competencies, talents, and\nabilities of its workforce \u2013 as an essential component\nof gaining competitive advantage\u2019. Indeed, human\ncapital is high on the policy agenda of national\ngovernments and international organizations [6].\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s government has been widely\n*Corresponding author: School of Engineering, Durham\nUniversity, Science Laboratories, Durham DH1 3LE, UK. email:\ngraham.coates@durham.ac.uk\nJEM608 \u0001 IMechE 2007 Proc. IMechE Vol. 221 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture\n1255\nreported as recognizing the growing importance of\nintangible assets, which include skills or human\ncapital [7, 8, 10]. Butler et al. [10] indicate that\nBritish businesses must compete by exploiting\ncapabilities, such as skills and knowledge, which its\ncompetitors cannot easily match or imitate. Further,\nit is stated \u2018the United Kingdom\u2019s government would\nlike to see better guidance for companies of all sizes\non assessing the strengths and weaknesses of their\nintangible assets, including the skills of their people\u2019.\nSimilarly, Allen and van der Velden [6] recognize that\nthere is now a greater need to monitor and assess\nthe stock of human capital. In addition, Elias and\nScarbrough [12] report wide recognition that com-\npanies need to develop mechanisms to determine\nthe value of their employee base.\nTraditionally within engineering companies, deci-\nsions regarding the composition of a project team\ninvolve managers using their judgement and experi-\nence to select the most appropriate engineers given\nthe nature of the tasks to be undertaken. The com-\nplexity of this decision making is compounded since\nengineers can be multiskilled with varying levels of\ncapability in these skills, and different tasks require\nspecific skills. Therefore, difficulties lie in knowing\nwhat specific skills and level of capability in these\nskills engineers possess, and which engineers should\nbe included in the project team. Higgs et al. [13]\nindicate that experience, talent, and education can\nform the basis for the selection of people for roles\nwithin teams. However, it is noted that an indivi-\ndual\u2019s success in meeting a team role depends on\nhow well his or her skills, characteristics, and experi-\nences match the team role requirement. Tseng et al.\n[14] assert that the formation of multifunctional\nteams is becoming a key issue in project manage-\nment. However, the right combination of members\nto be included within a team is very difficult to\nspecify, and therefore a significant challenge exists\nin forming a good project team. Failure to select\nthe right team members can result in extra budget\nbeing consumed, missed deadlines, and accom-\npanying compensation payments to clients. On this\ntheme, Castka et al. [15] indicate that incorrect\nteam composition will produce critical skill gaps,\nwhich will inevitably lead to a decrease in overall\nteam performance. In spite of the widely acknowl-\nedged importance of teams in organizations, it is\nreported that limited research has been conducted\non providing analytical solutions for team formation\n[14, 16].\nBased on the difficulties highlighted, there is a\nneed to assist project managers in modelling and\nplanning the composition of their engineering teams\nso that projects can be performed efficiently. In pur-\nsuit of this need, this paper presents a preliminary\napproach, which includes a simple means of how\nto identify the skills and quantify the capabilities of\nengineers such that the composition of an engineer-\ning team can be tailored with regard to the project\ntasks to be undertaken. Further, if the engineers in\na company do not have the required expertise to\nefficiently undertake certain tasks, project mana-\ngers require a means of identifying development\nneeds in terms of skills and capabilities. Therefore,\nthe approach also offers a means of identifying\nany imbalance or shortfall in skill and capability\nwithin an engineering project team, and formula-\nting a development strategy, which if implemented\nwould redress the imbalance and overcome the\nshortfall, and better position the company to face\nthe challenges posed by future projects.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as\nfollows. Section 2 builds on the introduction by pre-\nsenting a synopsis of related work. Section 3 pro-\nvides an overview of the preliminary approach. In\nsection 4, the approach is applied retrospectively to\nan industrial case study, which is then discussed in\nsection 5. Finally, section 6 presents conclusions\nand the direction of future work.\n2 RELATED WORK\nIt has been recognized by Andreasen et al. [17]\nthat much time and effort is lost in engineering\nprojects due to a lack of focus on managing work,\nwhich exposes considerable scope for improve-\nments and efficiency gains to be made. Duffy\net al. [18] highlight continuous improvements in\nexisting approaches to managing engineering, and\nthe introduction of new approaches will remain the\nfocus of research until adequate solutions, which\ncan be implemented in industry, can be found.\nIndeed, a well-thought-out process or system of\nmanagement is acknowledged as being central to\nthe efficient performance of an organization [19],\nwhich relies on the effective utilization of the avail-\nable talents, skills, and resources [20].\nButler et al. [10] expect regular measuring of skills\nto become commonplace, which could contribute\nto improving organizational performance. Indeed,\norganization teams are viewed as important contri-\nbutors in improving organizational performance\n[6, 7, 10, 21, 22]. Tether et al. [7] suggest that quan-\ntitative studies should be conducted in order to\nexplore the relationship between skill compositions\nand performance at a company level. As a result\nof an exploratory research study, Mendibil and\nMacBryde [22] indicate that to enable a team to\nsimultaneously, increase its contribution to the busi-\nness and motivate and develop the team and\nits individuals, there is a requirement for a tool\nthat facilitates the design of effective team-based\n1256 G Coates, A H B Duffy, W Hills, and R I Whitfield\nProc. IMechE Vol. 221 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture JEM608 \u0001 IMechE 2007\nperformance measurement systems (TPMSs). Further,\nit is suggested that a TPMS has the potential to be\nused as a team development tool. Beech and Crane\n[21] indicate that skills and team working have a\nmajor impact on corporate performance. Indeed,\nteamwork has been viewed as one of the most influ-\nential factors in successful companies in bringing\nabout significant improvements in productivity [3,\n15] and contributing to maximizing organizations\u2019\ncapability and responsiveness [23]. Higgs et al. [13]\nreport that when reviewing the literature on team\ncomposition and relating it to team performance, it\nbecomes apparent that, depending on the nature of\nthe task, factors such as team cohesion are required\nfor the successful completion of the task.\nAcademic interest is growing in the area of repre-\nsenting an organization\u2019s capability so that it can\nbe viewed externally as offering a range of services\nrather than developing specific products [24]. Such\nviews of an organization, referred to as competence\nprofiles or portfolios, are reported as facilitating the\ncreation of virtual enterprises, which involve several\ncompanies forming temporary alliances to address\nsome need [24, 25]. Further research on the theme\nof competence has been conducted on analysing\nand managing organizational competence [26\u201328],\nwhich has been viewed as the collective skills, abil-\nities, and expertise of individuals and groups within\norganizations [9]. Such research aims to define com-\npetence at a company level, which as alluded to earl-\nier can be useful for purposes such as the strategic\nformation of virtual enterprises.\nAt an individual level within a company, a means\nof quantifying the degree of engineers\u2019 skills and\ncapabilities is required to assist project managers in\nthe decision-making process regarding the composi-\ntion of a project team. In turn, this will facilitate the\neffective allocation and utilization of engineers with\nregard to the varying project tasks, given that each\ntask requires particular expertise. It has been recog-\nnized by Homer [4] that by not effectively matching\ntogether employees\u2019 skill ability and work, produc-\ntivity can be greatly reduced. Similarly, Matsumoto\net al. [5] report that employees\u2019 competency in\nperforming skills and a company\u2019s ability to deploy\nthem is a significant factor in determining the com-\npany\u2019s success. Ra [29] notes that managers faced\nwith staffing decisions would benefit from having a\ncomputerized tool, which allows a profile of the ideal\nperson for a given position to be entered and then\nsearches a database of the available talent within\nan organization returning a listing of qualified candi-\ndates most suitable for a position on the project\nteam. Likewise, Homer [4] cites a competency man-\nagement system as enabling a company to search\nthe skill profiles of current staff, such that when a\ncontract for work is won and profiles have been\ndrawn up for the ideal people they need to staff\ntheir project team, a list is generated of all the people\nin their organization with those skills. Similarly,\nRothwell and Lindholm [9] suggest that compet-\nency models are used to enable an organization to\nstaff its positions with employees who possess the\ncharacteristics of job exemplars.\nWith regard to the skills of an individual, research\nliterature differentiates between soft and hard skills\n[6, 7, 13, 21, 30\u201332]. Spinks et al. [31] view hard skills\nas those primarily related to a technical domain,\nwhich are underpinned by a strong theoretical\nbase. Further, with a particular focus on engineers,\nhard skills are referred to as defining skills, which\nare said to be unique to the engineer and encompass\na sound knowledge of the engineering fundamentals\nwithin their discipline. On the other hand, soft skills\nare seen as social and interpersonal skills that enable\neffective performance in a commercial working envi-\nronment. Collectively, soft skills have been defined\nas including communication skills, presentation\nskills, teamwork skills, collaborative problem-solving\nskills, conflict resolution skills, planning skills, and\ncustomer-handling skills [7, 12, 30, 31]. In the\nresearch reported, it has been widely recognized\nthat companies desire individuals with both hard\nand soft skills.\nAllen and van der Velden [6] report that most\nresearch and existing studies have focused on\naspects of hard skills, i.e. highly specific skills per-\ntaining to particular tasks, since these are relatively\nwell-defined and accessible to measurement under\ncontrolled conditions. Interestingly, Delbridge et al.\n[8] point out that the UK\u2019s national skill stocks\nare mainly measured in the form of formal quali-\nfications. In contrast, soft skills are conceptually\nmore difficult to measure [6, 7, 12]. Also, it is\nreported that the breadth and variety of specific\nand generic skills presents a major potential stum-\nbling block for researchers attempting to take stock\nof human capital [6]. Further, a variety of methods\ncommonly used to assess skill levels are cited\nincluding: objective measures through assessment\nand testing, subjective measures through supervisor\nrating, and self-assessment.\nFinding a way to quantify a person\u2019s skills and\nexperience is recognized as a fundamental problem\nand a significant challenge [29, 33]. While not offering\na means of eliciting measures of skills and experience,\nRa [29] proposes a simple numerical scale ranking\nlevel of experience from 0 to 9, where 0 represents\nno experience and 9 represents expert\/specialist.\nSimilarly, Matsumoto et al. [5] suggest employees\u2019\nskill performance scores being rated from 1 to 5,\nwhere 1 represents no ability and 5 represents an\nexpert understanding. On the theme of scoring skills,\nalthough with regard to self-assessment, it is reported\nModelling and planning the composition of engineering project teams 1257\nJEM608 \u0001 IMechE 2007 Proc. IMechE Vol. 221 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture\nthat there is no natural scale on which to measure\nskills, which is seen as placing a burden on research-\ners to provide a scale that is uniformly understood by\nall respondents [6]. Also, Elias and Scarbrough [12]\nreport that the research suggests there is no universal\nformula to score the value of employee skills and\ncompetencies. Whatever scale is used to represent\nan individual\u2019s skills, it has been recommended that\nit should be based on a combination of professional\ntraining, academic qualifications, and practical experi-\nence [5, 29]. While numerical scales have been used\nas an aid to team formation [5, 29], an alternative\napproach has been described in which the member-\nship of a team is related to the engineering charac-\nteristics of the product being developed [16]; i.e.\nbased on an overall goal, a set of customer require-\nments is developed, which are mapped to engineer-\ning characteristics that are then related to the\npossible team members.\nOrganizations need to maintain a strategic\napproach to their business, constantly assessing their\nstrengths and weaknesses, if they are to remain com-\npetitive [34]. Beech and Crane [21] state \u2018it has long\nbeen argued that the adoption of Human Resource\nManagement policies focusing on the development\nof people and their involvement in teams could\nand should enhance individual and organisational\nperformance\u2019. By identifying skill strengths and\nweaknesses at a team level, workload can be better\nmatched with skill strengths, and training strategies\ncan be developed to address skill weaknesses or skill\ngaps in its future business needs [5, 15]. Spinks et al.\n[31] indicate that companies adopt a number of stra-\ntegies in response to perceived skill deficiencies\nincluding upskilling by increasing training, inskilling\nthrough intensified recruitment efforts, and outskill-\ning through the use of third parties to undertake\nskilled work. Indeed, it is recognized that by not\nappropriately managing peoples\u2019 skills, an organiza-\ntion could be wasting money on ineffective training\nprogrammes and strategies [4]. Therefore, skills man-\nagement is reported as growing in popularity in the\nhuman resource management community. The cap-\nability to assess competencies and determine skill\ngaps enables organizations to implement more cost-\neffective and meaningful training and development\npractices so that their specific business goals can\nbe met.\n3 OVERVIEW OF THE PRELIMINARY\nAPPROACH\nThe preliminary approach is aimed at assisting\nproject managers across a range of engineering\nindustries by contributing towards efficient project\nperformance. The approach provides a means of\nenabling project managers to identify engineers\u2019\nskills and then quantify their capabilities, in relation\nto the tasks to be undertaken, such that the compo-\nsition of project teams can be effectively planned,\nleading to the competitive completion of engineer-\ning projects in terms of timescale and cost. In addi-\ntion, the approach enables the identification of any\nimbalance or shortfall in a team\u2019s expertise and, in\nresponse, the formulation of an appropriate devel-\nopment strategy to redress\/overcome them. An over-\nview of the preliminary approach is shown in Fig. 1.\nInitially, through consultation with project man-\nagers, engineers\u2019 skills are identified and the level\nof capability in these skills is quantified. Project\nmanagers perform their subjective assessment based\non the defined tasks in the project under considera-\ntion and historical information such as engineers\u2019\nperformance in corresponding or similar tasks under-\ntaken in past projects. Numerical representation of an\nengineer\u2019s level of capability in skills is essential for a\npurposeful analysis to be performed. More specif-\nically, the numerical representation is compatible in\nthe subsequent production of a project schedule, in\nthe next step of the approach, since the expected\ntime taken to complete any given task by any given\nengineer can be determined using the task\u2019s datum\nduration and the engineer\u2019s level of capability in the\nassociated skill.\nOnce engineers\u2019 skill capabilities have been\nquantified, the initial model of the engineering pro-\nject team can be represented. In consideration of\nthis model of the team and the defined project tasks,\na genetic algorithm (GA) and a task-to-engineer allo-\ncation strategy, both of which were developed for the\napproach, are applied, leading to the generation of a\nproposed project schedule. Jointly, the GA and allo-\ncation strategy manage the complexities involved\nin distributing interdependent project tasks among\nengineers who have different levels of capability in\nvarious skills, while simultaneously minimizing the\nproject\u2019s expected duration and labour cost.\nAn analysis is performed on the proposed project\nschedule generated facilitating the composition of\nthe engineering project team to be planned, leading\nto the appropriate representation of engineers\u2019 skills\nand capabilities. In addition, an analysis of the pro-\nposed project schedule leads to the identification of\nany imbalance or shortfall in the skills and capabil-\nities of engineers in the project team. To assess the\nmagnitude of any imbalance or shortfall in expertise,\ntask duration-to-capability ratios are determined.\nAwareness of any imbalance or shortfall in expertise\ndefines the formulation of an appropriate develop-\nment strategy, such as developing the skills and\ncapabilities of existing engineers and\/or recruiting\nengineers with skills and capabilities needed to fill\nthe gaps within the team.\n1258 G Coates, A H B Duffy, W Hills, and R I Whitfield\nProc. IMechE Vol. 221 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture JEM608 \u0001 IMechE 2007\n4 INDUSTRIAL CASE STUDY\nThe case study was provided by domnick hunter\nLimited, which is an organization consisting of an\ninternational group of companies involved in the\ndevelopment and provision of filtration, purification,\nand separation products for various industries and\napplications. The case study relates to a project invol-\nving the design development of compressed air treat-\nment equipment, which was undertaken by a team of\nnine multiskilled engineers from the Research and\nDevelopment (R&D) department. The approach was\napplied retrospectively to the project, which the orga-\nnization estimated to have a duration of 60 weeks.\nTo identify the skills of the engineers, first the\nproject tasks associated with each skill needed to be\nspecified. Table 1 summarizes the 15 skills associated\nwith the 190 project tasks. Discussions with the\nR&D manager resulted in information being elicited\nregarding what skills each engineer possessed, and\nlevels of capabilities in these skills. To identify the\nskills of an engineer, the R&D manager made use of\nhistorical project information. Specifically, if an engi-\nneer had previously worked on tasks, or similar tasks,\nassociated with a skill needed for the project under\nconsideration, then that individual was identified as\nhaving some capability in that skill. Subsequently,\nfor each skill of each engineer, the R&D manager\nquantified the level of capability by using the most\nproficient individual in that skill as a benchmark.\nInitially, this involved defining the datum duration\nof each task associated with each skill; i.e. the datum\nduration of a task with an associated skill, say task\nTi and skill Sj, was defined as the time taken to com-\nplete the task, tTiSj , by the most proficient engineer\nable to undertake the task.

Therefore, in the case of an engineer\nunable to undertake all of the tasks associated with\na particular skill, in equation (1) the denominator\nis zero, and consequently the engineer\u2019s level of\ncapability in this skill is defined as zero. Conversely,\nfor an engineer viewed as being the most proficient\nin all tasks associated with a skill, in equation (1)\nthe numerator and denominator are equal, leading\nto a level of capability in this skill of unity. In all\nother cases, the engineer\u2019s level of capability in a\nskill will lie between zero and unity.\nAs an example, let a skill, say skill S1, associated\nwith five tasks be defined as having datum durations\n10, 15, 15, 10, and 20 units of time respectively. If an\nengineer, say engineer E1, is estimated to be able to\ncomplete the tasks associated with this skill in 15,\n20, 25, 15, and 25 units of time respectively, then the\nengineer\u2019s skill capability would be determined as\nSCE01,S01\u00bc\nX5\ni\u00bc1\ntTiS01\ntTiS01,E01\n\u00bc 10\u00fe15\u00fe15\u00fe10\u00fe20\n15\u00fe20\u00fe25\u00fe15\u00fe25 \u00bc 0:7 \u00f02\u00de\nThis means of scoring and representing an\nengineer\u2019s level of skill capability is directly relevant\nto the preliminary approach since it is compatible\nwith the production of a project schedule using the\nGA and tasks-to-engineer allocation strategy; i.e.\nwith the objective of simultaneously minimizing the\nproject\u2019s expected duration and labour cost, the GA\nand task-to-engineer allocation strategy are able to\ndetermine the expected time taken to complete any\ngiven task by any given engineer. Specifically, the\nexpected time taken to complete any task is equal\nto its datum duration divided by the engineer\u2019s level\nof capability in the skill associated with the task.\nAlthough not indicated in Table 1, as explained each\nproject task has a datum duration based on being\nundertaken by an engineer with a capability of unity\nin the associated skill. Table 2 shows the initial\nmodel of the engineering project team representing\nthe engineers\u2019 skills and levels of capability in these\nskills.\nIn Table 2, each cell contains a numerical value on\na scale of 0 to 1, which indicates an engineer\u2019s level\nof capability for each respective skill. A value of\nzero indicates that the engineer is unable to under-\ntake tasks of the associated skill. Conversely, a non-\nzero value signifies that an engineer is capable of\nundertaking tasks of the associated skill. In addition\nto assigning levels of capability in terms of skills,\neach engineer was also allocated a labour cost per\nunit time, which is used in generating proposed\nproject schedules.\nUsing the GA and the task-to-engineer allocation\nstrategy, with the aim of minimizing the project\u2019s\nexpected duration and labour cost, a datum pro-\nposed project schedule was generated. From this\nschedule, in which the 190 tasks were allocated\namong the nine engineers, the project\u2019s expected\nduration and labour cost were calculated to be\n64 weeks and 223 554 units respectively. As stated\nearlier, the organization estimated the project dura-\ntion to be 60 weeks. The discrepancy between the\norganization\u2019s expected project duration and that\nobtained from the schedule was deemed acceptable\nin terms of enabling subsequent comparisons to be\nmade for proposed compositions of the engineering\nproject team.\nImportantly, in the datum proposed project\nschedule, tasks were allocated to all nine of the engi-\nneers. However, on inspection of the schedule, engi-\nneers\u2019 with lower levels of capability in a skill were\npredominantly not allocated tasks associated with\nthat skill. Consequently, a decision was made to\nexecute the GA and allocation strategy again, with\nengineers\u2019 lower-level capabilities excluded from\nconsideration; i.e. engineers\u2019 lower levels of capability\nin a skill were set to zero, thus preventing them\nfrom being allocated tasks associated with that skill.\nTable 3 presents the five cases involving the exclu-\nsion of lower-level capabilities. For each case, the\nproject\u2019s expected duration and labour cost are\nshown, which were obtained from the corresponding\nproposed project schedule produced using the GA\nand task-to-engineer allocation strategy.\nTable 2 Initial model of the engineering project team\nEngineer Skills and capabilities\nIndex Cost per unit time S01 S02 S03 S04 S05 S06 S07 S08 S09 S10 S11 S12 S13 S14 S15\nE01 12 0.3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.2 0.4 0 0.1 0 0.5 0.1 0.6\nE02 20 0.9 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.2 0.1 0 0 0.9 0 0.1 0.1\nE03 20 0.7 0.1 0 0 0.8 0.5 0.5 0.2 0.7 0.8 0 0 0.7 0.1 0.7\nE04 15 0.5 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.1 0.5 0.3 0.7 0.5 0.6 0.8 0 0.5 0.8 0.2\nE05 17 0.7 1.0 0.9 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.8 0.8 0 0.5 0.8 0.2\nE06 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.0 0 0 0\nE07 17 0.5 0.1 0 0 0 0.3 0.2 0.5 0.8 0.9 0 0 0.9 0.1 0.9\nE08 12 0 0 0 0.3 0.3 0 0.2 0.3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nE09 17 0.5 0.1 0 0 0 0 0.3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1260 G Coates, A H B Duffy, W Hills, and R I Whitfield\nProc. IMechE Vol. 221 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture JEM608 \u0001 IMechE 2007\nFrom Table 3, it is observed that Case 2, in which\nengineers\u2019 capabilities of 0.2 or less are excluded,\nprovides the lowest expected duration of the project.\nSpecifically, the project was scheduled to be com-\npleted in 36 weeks as opposed to 64 weeks for the\ndatum proposed project schedule. In addition to\nthis 44 per cent reduction in the project\u2019s expected\nduration, a reduction of 44 per cent in labour cost\nis observed with respect to the datum proposed pro-\nject schedule. As shown in Table 3, Case 5, involving\nengineers\u2019 capabilities of 0.1 to 0.5 being excluded,\nresults in the greatest expected duration for the pro-\nject. The reason for this increase is attributed to\nengineers with capabilities of 0.5 not being allocated\ntasks that they would be ordinarily. Thus, while it is\nuseful to exclude engineers\u2019 lower levels of capability\nthere is a threshold beyond which the expected\nduration of the project will increase.\nFor Case 2, an analysis was performed on the\nproposed project schedule to identify any imbalance\nin the project team with respect to the engineers\nallocated to undertake the tasks associated with\neach skill. The analysis entails identifying the engi-\nneer allocated to each task and then dividing the\ntask\u2019s datum duration by the engineer\u2019s level of\ncapability for the associated skill. For each skill, the\nexpected task durations were then summed and\ndivided by the cumulative capabilities of the engi-\nneers allocated to the associated tasks. Based on\nthis analysis, task duration-to-capability ratios were\ncalculated, as shown in Table 4.\nIn Table 4, the ratios for skills S08 and S12 are\nrelatively greater than for other skills, signifying a\nnoticeable imbalance in the project team. Attempts\nto redress this imbalance were proposed using two\nstrategies: (a) recruiting an engineer to the project\nteam with the appropriate level of capability in the\ndeficient skills and (b) developing existing engineers\nin the project team, leading to improvements in their\nlevel of capability in the deficient skills.\nAs shown earlier in Table 2, with regard to skill\nS12, only engineers E02 and E06 are able to complete\nassociated tasks with capability levels of 0.9 and 1.0\nrespectively. Thus, scope to develop these engineers\nis negligible. On inspecting the proposed project\nschedule for Case 2, the utilization was seen to be\ninsignificant for engineers E01 and E09, as shown\nin Table 5.\nGiven the lack of utilization of engineers E01\nand E09, they were selected to be developed. The\nproposed changes to the project team are shown\nin Table 6, in which each case reflects changes in\naddition to excluding engineers\u2019 capabilities of 0.2\nand less.\nFigure 2 shows the project\u2019s labour cost versus\nexpected duration associated with each proposed\nproject schedule produced using the GA and task-to-\nengineer allocation strategy, for Cases 6 to 11 consid-\nered in Table 6 and Cases 1 to 5 considered in Table 3.\nTable 6 Engineer skill\u2013capability cases\nCase Description\n6 Recruit an engineer with a capability of 1.0 in skill S08\n7 Recruit an engineer with a capability of 1.0 in skill S12\n8 Recruit an engineer with a capability of 1.0 in skills S08\nand S12\n9 Develop engineers E01 and E09 to have a capability of\n1.0 in skill S08\n10 Develop engineers E01 and E09 to have a capability of\n1.0 in skill S12\n11 Develop engineers E01 and E09 to have capabilities of\n1.0 in skills S08 and S12\nTable 3 Engineer skill\u2013capability cases\nCase Description Expected duration (weeks) Labour costs (units)\n1 Exclude capabilities of 0.1 39.2 134762\n2 Exclude capabilities of 0.1\u20130.2 36.0 124106\n3 Exclude capabilities of 0.1\u20130.3 38.1 118258\n4 Exclude capabilities of 0.1\u20130.4 37.8 117174\n5 Exclude capabilities of 0.1\u20130.5 45.5 109443\nTable 4 Task duration-to-capability ratios for Case 2\nSkill S01 S02 S03 S04 S05 S06 S07 S08 S09 S10 S11 S12 S13 S14 S15\nRatio 7 39 21 43 10 16 18 122 16 5 39 162 5 48 89\nTable 5 Engineer utilization \u2013 Case 2\nEngineer E01 E02 E03 E04 E05 E06 E07 E08 E09\nUtilization (%) 0 88.3 67.2 97.2 83.3 88.9 91.1 83.9 1.1\nModelling and planning the composition of engineering project teams 1261\nJEM608 \u0001 IMechE 2007 Proc. IMechE Vol. 221 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture\nIn Fig. 2, the lowest expected duration to complete\nthe project corresponds with Case 11, which involves\ndeveloping the capabilities of existing engineers E01\nand E09 with respect to tasks associated with skills\nS08 and S12. In relation to the datum proposed pro-\nject schedule, Case 11 corresponds to a 52 per cent\nreduction in the project\u2019s expected duration and a\n45 per cent reduction in labour cost.\nTo establish if any further proposed changes to the\nteam would result in reducing the project\u2019s expected\nduration, an analysis was performed on the proposed\nproject schedule for Case 11, leading to the calcula-\ntion of task duration-to-capability ratios for each skill.\nFigure 3 presents a comparison of task duration-to-\ncapability ratios for Cases 2 and 11. While the imbal-\nance in the project team has not been completely\nredressed, it can be seen that the most prominent dis-\ncrepancies between the ratios for skills S08 and S12\nhave been reduced considerably.\nIn summary, as a result of excluding engineers\u2019\nskill capabilities of 0.2 and less, and the proposed\ndevelopment of two existing engineers with regard\nto their capability to undertake tasks associated\nwith two specific skills, it has been shown that the\nexpected duration to complete the project could be\nreduced by 52 per cent with respect to the datum\nproposed project schedule. In addition, a labour\ncost reduction of 45 per cent could be achieved.\n5 DISCUSSION\nThe case study provided by domnick hunter\nlimited enabled an initial application of the prelim-\ninary approach. Prior to being introduced to this\nresearch, the organization had not considered quan-\ntifying their engineers\u2019 capabilities or modelling the\nproject team in the manner proposed. While the\nmethod used to elicit measures of engineers\u2019 skills\nand capabilities is elementary, it did provide a basis\nfor the organization to gain a quantified representa-\ntion of its engineers\u2019 capabilities relative to the tasks\nto be undertaken, which could aid the planning of\nupcoming projects.\nWith a numerical representation of the engineers\u2019\ncapabilities in a range of skills, the GA and task-to-\nallocation strategy were used to generate a datum\nproposed project schedule. All nine engineers were\nallocated tasks in this schedule, but they were not\nallocated tasks associated with a skill for which\nthey held a lower level of capability. As such, the\nexclusion of lower-level capabilities was proposed.\nModelling the project team in this fashion showed\nthat excluding engineers\u2019 capabilities of 0.2 or less\nFig. 3 Comparison of task duration-to-capability ratios for Cases 2 and 11\nExpected duration (weeks)\n25 30 35 40 45 50\n100\n110\n120\n130\n140\n150\n1\n2 \n8\n7\n6\n5\n43\n11\n10\n9\nLa\nbo\nur\n c\nos\nt (\nun\nits\n x \n10\n3 )\nFig. 2 Project\u2019s labour cost versus expected duration for\nCases 1 to 11\n1262 G Coates, A H B Duffy, W Hills, and R I Whitfield\nProc. IMechE Vol. 221 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture JEM608 \u0001 IMechE 2007\nresulted in potential reductions of 44 per cent in the\nproject\u2019s expected duration and labour cost with\nrespect to the datum proposed project schedule.\nThese potential reductions were offered since engi-\nneers with capabilities of 0.1 and 0.2 were prevented\nfrom being allocated tasks associated with the corre-\nsponding skill. Even with this proposed representa-\ntion of the team, an imbalance existed in terms of\nengineers\u2019 capabilities in relation to project tasks.\nThis imbalance was established using task duration-\nto-capability ratios derived from the proposed\nproject schedules generated using the GA and task-\nto-engineer allocation strategy. In response to this\nimbalance, further to engineers\u2019 capabilities of 0.2\nor less being ignored, changes to the composition\nof the project team were proposed, i.e. the develop-\nment of existing engineers and recruitment of a\nnew engineer. More specifically, two engineers\nwere chosen to be developed since they were signif-\nicantly underutilized in the proposed project sched-\nule corresponding to excluding capabilities of 0.2\nor less. The development of these two engineers\ninvolved increasing their level of capability from 0\nto 1 in two particular skills. While the approach\ndoes identify in which skills the team is deficient,\nalong with which engineers could be developed, it\ndoes not provide a means of specifying what level\nof capability would best be required in terms of\nreducing the project\u2019s expected duration and labour\ncost. As such, a value of unity was selected since this\nis the greatest value possible in the context of the\napproach. Further, the approach does not identify\nhow an engineer could be developed so that their\nlevel of capability would increase. In terms of\nrecruiting an engineer, the proposed change to the\nengineering project team\u2019s composition involved\nadding a person with a capability of unity in combi-\nnations of the two deficient skills. Again, a value of\nunity was chosen since it is the greatest value possi-\nble. An analysis of this proposed change to the com-\nposition of the project team, using the proposed\nproject schedules generated, showed that develop-\ning two existing engineers so that they were able to\ncomplete tasks associated with the two deficient\nskills resulted in a 52 per cent reduction in expected\nduration and a 45 per cent reduction in labour cost.\nFurther, the imbalance within the team of engineers\nwas significantly redressed.\nAs a result of the application of the preliminary\napproach, the proposed skills and capabilities of\nengineers in the project team are shown in Table 7.\nShaded cells indicate where proposed changes\nshould be made with respect to the initial model of\nthe engineering project team, which was shown ear-\nlier in Table 2. Therefore, the application of the\napproach has demonstrated potential in terms of\nmodelling and planning the composition of an engi-\nneering project team, and identifying where pro-\nposed changes in the team\u2019s composition could be\nmade and their effects in terms of reducing the\nproject\u2019s expected duration and labour cost.\nThe company provided feedback indicating that\nthe research offers a practical approach to modelling\nand managing the engineers in their R&D depart-\nment. Further, it was noted that the research provi-\ndes a useful technique for assessing their personnel\nrequirements prior to starting projects involving\ntheir multidisciplinary, multiskilled engineering team.\nWith regard to the significant reductions in the pro-\nject\u2019s expected duration and labour cost, the company\nstressed that figures of the order achieved need to be\nrealized for them to be successful in the future.\n6 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nEngineering companies are constantly striving to\nenhance their current approaches to project man-\nagement and introduce new approaches in order to\nimprove performance and maintain competitive-\nness. Therefore, the research presented in this paper\nis timely in that it introduces a preliminary approach\nto modelling and planning the composition of engi-\nneering project teams. The approach has been\napplied retrospectively to an industrial project invol-\nving the design development of compressed air\nTable 7 Proposed model of the engineering design team\u2019s skills and capabilities\nSkills and capabilities\nEngineer S01 S02 S03 S04 S05 S06 S07 S08 S09 S10 S11 S12 S13 S14 S15\nE01 0.3 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.0 0.4 0 0 1.0 0.5 0 0.6\nE02 0.9 0 0 0 0.5 0.5 0.5 0 0 0 0 0.9 0 0 0\nE03 0.7 0 0 0 0.8 0.5 0.5 0 0.7 0.8 0 0 0.7 0 0.7\nE04 0.5 0.9 0.9 0.9 0 0.5 0.3 0.7 0.5 0.6 0.8 0 0.5 0.8 0\nE05 0.7 1.0 0.9 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.8 0.8 0 0.5 0.8 0\nE06 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.0 0 0 0\nE07 0.5 0 0 0 0 0.3 0 0.5 0.8 0.9 0 0 0.9 0 0.9\nE08 0 0 0 0.3 0.3 0 0 0.3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nE09 0.5 0 0 0 0 0 0.3 1.0 0 0 0 1.0 0 0 0\nModelling and planning the composition of engineering project teams 1263\nJEM608 \u0001 IMechE 2007 Proc.

In this application, support\nhas been provided in modelling and planning team\ncomposition in terms of engineers\u2019 skills and level\nof capability in these skills, in relation to the project\ntasks to be undertaken, using a GA and task-to-\nengineer allocation strategy. Further, the application\nhas facilitated the identification of an imbalance in\nthe team with respect to engineers\u2019 skill and capabil-\nities given the tasks to be undertaken. Based on this\nimbalance, considered changes to the team were\nproposed and assessed, again using the GA and allo-\ncation strategy, in terms of expected duration to\ncomplete the project, engineer labour cost, and\nthe degree to which any disproportion in the engi-\nneers\u2019 skills and capabilities has been redressed.\nConsequently, the exclusion of engineers\u2019 lower-\nlevel skill capabilities, along with the proposed\ndevelopment of two existing engineers with regard\nto two specific skills, led to a potential 52 per cent\nreduction in the expected duration to complete the\nproject with an associated 45 per cent reduction in\nlabour cost.\nIt is acknowledged that within the preliminary\napproach, some of the means used are simplistic in\nnature. However, the approach does provide a useful\nframework for further development; i.e. significant\nscope exists to develop more sophisticated means\nwithin the approach, such as how to identify the\nskills of engineers and, in particular, how to quantify\nthe level of capability of engineers in the skills they\nhave. Presently, the approach involves measuring\nskills in relation to the tasks to be undertaken.\nAs such, in addition to consultation with project\nmanagers, a further means of identifying skills and\nquantifying capabilities may involve using question-\nnaires, assessment, and interviews with engineers in\nconsideration of factors such as their practical\nexperience, theoretical knowledge, previous perform-\nance, training, and qualifications. In addition, such a\nmeans should endeavour to take into account soft or\ninterpersonal skills, such as those mentioned in sec-\ntion 2. However, it is acknowledged that this is a\nhighly complex problem, which is widely recognized\nin the research literature.\nThe emphasis of the approach\u2019s application pre-\nsented in this paper focused on the objectives of\nreducing the project\u2019s expected duration and labour\ncost. While it is acknowledged that these objectives\nare of great importance, it is also recognized that\ncompanies may have other objectives such as devel-\noping their personnel so that, in turn, the organiza-\ntions and their teams can continuously improve\nperformance in future projects and thus remain\ncompetitive. Therefore, in addition to using reduc-\ntion in project duration to measure performance,\nother performancemetrics and an appropriate means\nof measuring them should be researched. Further,\nthere is scope within the approach to develop\ntask-to-engineer allocation strategies related to devel-\nopment at an individual and company level. The\ndevelopment of individuals would focus on broaden-\ning engineers\u2019 technical and interpersonal skills, and\nimproving their capabilities. This could be realized\nin a number of ways such as shadowing proficient\nengineers, exposure to new and challenging work,\nand precision professional training. Indeed, Glen [35]\nrecognizes that in today\u2019s highly competitive envi-\nronments, it is of vital importance to support employ-\nees through providing them with experience-based\ndevelopment initiatives such as participation in key\norganizational projects. At a company level, broaden-\ning and improving the skill set of engineers would\nalso result in reducing the vulnerability represented\nby people leaving the organization and taking key\ncapabilities with them. Further, in terms of company\ndevelopment in relation to future projects, recruiting\nengineers with specific skills and capabilities not\npresently held within the organization would be a\npossible option for consideration.\nFinally, while the industrial case study presented\nin the paper demonstrates an application of the pre-\nliminary approach to a single project, there is a need\nto seek further case studies involving multiple pro-\njects being undertaken concurrently. This will enable\nthe approach to be developed to manage the com-\nplexities of resource contention in scenarios where\nskilled engineers are required to simultaneously\nwork on several projects.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to\ndomnick hunter limited for providing a case study\nthat enabled an initial application of the preliminary\napproach.\nREFERENCES\n1 Pemberton-Billing, J., Cooper, R., Wootton, A.
