In an \neffort to improve outplanting performance, a variety of seedling quality assessment \nmethods has been developed, based on seedling morphological attributes, such as shoot \nheight, root collar diameter, height to diameter ratio, and root to shoot ratio (Deans et al. \n1989; Dey and Parker 1997; Jacobs et al. 2005; Zida et al. 2008). However, despite \nadvances in seedling quality testing and prediction of field performance, no single test \nhas proved suitable across a multitude of species and conditions (Davis and Jacobs 2005), \nindicating that  seedling attributes need to be determined at the species level and take into \naccount specific environmental and management conditions (Zida et al. 2008).  \n \nSeedlings destined for irrigated sites probably require different management in the \nnursery compared to those for non-irrigated plantations because they will experience less \nwater stress, although they will still experience post-transplant shock (Oliet et al. 2002). \nConsequently, the tendency to favor low shoot:root ratios (large root systems) promoting \nsubsequent rapid root growth may appear unnecessary and undesirable for irrigated \nconditions. However, overcoming post-transplant shock is only possible if new root \n 3\n64 \n65 \n66 \n67 \n68 \n69 \n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \n74 \n75 \n76 \n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \n84 \nelongation takes place shortly after transplanting the seedlings (Oliet et al. 2002). Such \ngrowth and production of new roots are affected by water availability as well as the \nbalance between shoot and root (Becker et al. 1987; Rose et al. 1993). While there are \nseveral reports of indices developed for harsh conditions (Deans et al. 1989; Bayley and \nKietzka 1996; Rawat and Singh 2000; Villar-Salvador et al. 2004; Davis and Jacobs \n2005) little information describing the desirable attributes of tree seedlings for irrigated \nsystems in arid climates is available (Zida et al. 2008). In short rotation applications, the \nemphasis needs to be focused on producing seedlings which have the capacity to \nimmediately begin rapid shoot growth following outplanting. Consequently, nursery \nregimes geared to produce such plant types need to be developed. \n \nTherefore, this paper examines the influence of substrate on the morphology of planting \nstock of five exotic tree species for irrigated conditions and their performance in the field. \nTwo contrasting substrates were used because of the evident effect of this factor on \nresource allocation, and the tendency of plant species to allocate more resources to the \ndevelopment of root systems on poor soils such as sand (Balisky et al. 1995; Osmont et \nal. 2007; Semchenko et al. 2007). The selected species are fast growing and can produce \nboth wood and fodder, which are both in high demand in urban and peri-urban areas of \nBurkina Faso. Short-rotation plantations, irrigated with treated waste-water, are one \noption to help meet this demand.  \n \n 4\nMaterials and methods 85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n \nStudy site \n \nPlants were grown in a nursery in the open courtyard of D\u00e9partement Productions \nForesti\u00e8res (DPF) of Institut de l\u2019Environnement et de Recherches Agricoles (INERA) in \nOuagadougou, Burkina Faso, West Africa (12o22\u2019 N and 1o30\u2019 W and at an altitude of \n306 m.a.s.l). The rainfall at the site is unimodal with a mean annual rainfall of 804 mm, \nand a rainy season between May and September. The mean annual temperature is 28oC \nwith a minimum of 22oC and a maximum of 35oC. The plantation was established in a \nplot 500 m from the DPF courtyard thus experiencing the same climatic conditions as in \nthe nursery site. \n \nExperimental design \n \nNursery phase \nA factorial experiment was designed to test the effects of species and substrate on \nseedling morphological attributes and indices of five exotic species as indicators of their \nfuture performance in short-rotation irrigated plantations to produce fodder and wood. \nThus, two factors were investigated: \n1. Five species: Acacia angustissima (Mil.) Kuntze, Acacia mangium Wild, Gliricidia \nsepium (Jacq.) Alp., Leucaena hybrid (LxL), and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit \n 5\n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n2. Two substrates: pure sand and normal nursery substrate in Burkina Faso (a mixture of \narable soil, sand and manure in the proportions of 2v:1v:1v) (Table 1).  \nThe experiment was laid out in eight blocks or replicates, with a split plot design. Tree \nspecies was the main plot and substrate was the sub plot, with four plants within the sub \nplot. Thus each block contained 5 (species) x 2 (substrates) x 4 (plants) = 40 pots. \n \nSeeds were pre-treated according to the recommendations of the supplier (Agro-forester \nTropical Seeds of Holualoa, Hawaii, USA) and pre-germinated for one week and then \ntransplanted into poly bags of 25 cm height and 7 cm diameter (962 cm3) at the end of \nJune 2005. All treatments were watered twice a day with tap water using a watering can. \nNo fungicide or pesticide was used in the present experiment. At the end of the nursery \nphase in September 2005, i.e. after 2.5 months, half of the seedlings were destructively \nharvested to evaluate for their morphological attributes and the remaining half was used \nfor the plantation. \n \nPlantation phase \nAs in the nursery, the design was a split plot design with species factor attributed to the \nmain plot treatment and the substrate used in the nursery to the sub plot. Plants were \nplanted in three blocks or replicates, and there were 2 plants for each substrate in the sub \nplot. Thus each block contained 5 (species) x 2 (substrates) x 2 (plants) = 20 pots. Plants \nwere carefully removed from their pots and planted out with 1 m intervals in a row and 2 \nm between rows. A 4 m space was allowed between blocks. The plants were watered \nevery three days with treated waste-water from the University of Ouagadougou in \n 6\n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \n150 \n151 \nBurkina Faso. The plants were watered until saturation, when water remained on the soil \nsurface around the plants. The water had been treated through a succession of basins \nstarting with a homogenizing basin, followed by an anaerobic basin, an aerobic basin and \na distribution basin. The treated water had the following properties: temperature 30.1oC, \nconductivity 259 \u03bcS m-1, dissolved O2 1.9 mg l-1, pH 7.7, Escherichia coli 13000 Colony \nForming Units (cfu) l-1, Thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) 85000 cfu,  Fecal streptococcus \n(FS) 7000 cfu, Biochemical Oxygen Demand-Five-Day (DOB5) 10 mg l-1, Chemical \nOxygen Demand (COD) 46 mg l-1 , Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) 28 mg l-1, total \nP 1.4 mg l-1, PO43- 0.7 mg l-1,  NH4+  3.8 mg l-1 and NO3-. 1.5 mg l-1. \n \nData collection and handling \n \nNursery phase \nIn September 2005 half of the seedlings were harvested and their height, root collar \ndiameter (rcd) and tap root length (from the ground or root collar level to the tip of the \nmain and longest root) were measured. They were then divided into shoots and roots, and \nthe roots were washed. All components were then dried to constant weight at 60oC for 48 \nh. The following seedling quality and performance attributes were then assessed: \nshoot:root dry weight ratio (SRR), sturdiness quotient (SQ) (height (cm)\/rcd (mm)), and \nDickson\u2019s Quality Index (DQI) (Deans et al. 1989), which was calculated as follows \n(Eq.1): \n \n 7\nQuality index =  \n(g) dry weightRoot \n(g) dry weightShoot \n(mm)diameter collar Root \n(cm)Height \n(g) dry weight Seedling\n+\n   Eq.1 152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n \nPlantation phase \nTwelve months after out-planting (14.5-month old plants), the height and diameter at \n1.30 m (dbh) of the trees were measured, and half the plants were carefully uprooted and \nseparated into leaves, wood and roots. The roots were then washed, and all plant \ncomponents were dried as before. For this phase, only SRR was calculated. \n \nData analysis \nData from the nursery and plantation phases were tested for homogeneity of variances \nbefore being subjected to general analysis of variance (ANOVA) using GenStat Release \n8.11 (Rothamsted Experimental Station) software package. When the F-test was \nsignificant, treatment means were separated using the least significant difference (LSD) \nmethod at 5% probability. Correlation analyses were also used to establish relationships \nbetween plant performance at nursery and plantation phases.  \n \nResults \n \nNursery phase \nThe survival rates ranged from 86% for A. angustissima to 100% for L. leucocephala and \nfrom 96% for sand to 97% for nursery substrate. \n \n 8\nPlant dimensions 174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \n181 \n182 \n183 \n184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \nThere were, significant species x substrate interactions and significant main effects of \nspecies and substrate for plant height (P<0.001), rcd (P<0.001), and tap root length \n(P<0.01) (Table 2). All species grown on ordinary nursery substrate were taller and had \ngreater root collar diameters than their counterparts grown in sand, while root length was \nusually not significantly different within a species, or, in the case of L. hybrid was \nsignificantly longer in sand (Table 3). Despite the differences in growth between nursery \nsubstrate and sand, the ranking of the performance of plants in both substrates tended to \nbe similar, except for A. angustissima which in terms of height growth performed much \nbetter in nursery substrate than in sand (Table 3). \n \nPlant weights \nShoot, root and total dry weights also showed significant species x substrate interactions \nas well as significant main effects of these two factors (all P<0.001) (Tables 2 and 4). \nWhen grown in sand, shoot weights did not differ between species, but when grown in \nnursery substrate, significant differences were present, with L. leucocephala and G. \nsepium being the heaviest and the two acacia species the lightest.  Root weights did differ \nbetween species in both substrates, and were least for the acacias.  \n \nSeedling quality and performance attributes \nAs for the previous parameters,  analysis of the indices revealed significant species x \nsubstrate interactions, as well as significant main effects (all P<0.001) (Tables 2 and 5).  \n 9\n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \n217 \nAll species had significantly higher SQ\u2019s in nursery substrate than their counterparts in \nsand, except for A. mangium. Overall, A. angustissima had the highest values and G. \nsepium the lowest. In terms of shoot: root ratio, all species had higher values in nursery \nsubstrate than in sand, except for L. leucocephala, and the acacias had the highest \nshoot:root ratios. Dickson\u2019s quality index was higher in nursery substrate, with G. sepium \nand L. leucocephala being superior to the rest. Within a substrate, trends in DQI between \nspecies were the reverse of those in SQ and SRR, as expected by their mathematical \nrelationships. \n \nPlantation phase \nTwelve months after out-planting, survival rates ranged from 50% for A. angustissima to \n100% for L. leucocephala and from 80% for plants originating from sand substrate to \n83% for those from nursery substrate. By this time, some species exceeded 5 m in height. \n \nAnalysis of the data from the plantation phase revealed no significant interaction between \nfactors for effects on plant dimensions, weights of plant components or shoot:root ratio, \nand no effect of substrate used in the nursery. Species was the only factor that exerted a \nsignificant effect on all variables (all P<0.05 at least) except for leaf weight (Table 6). \nThe two leucaena species were the tallest, and they, together with G. sepium were overall \nthe best performing species in terms of weight, height and dbh (Table 7). The small \nacacias had the highest shoot:root ratios, while Leucaena hybrid had the lowest. \n \n 10\nLeaf biomass that could be used as fodder ranged from 0.18 t ha-1 for A. angustissima to \n0.29 t ha-1 for L. hybrid while wood production (stem biomass) which could be used as \nfuel ranged from 0.42 t ha-1 for A. angustissima to 0.98 t ha-1 for G. sepium (Table 7).  \n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n \nRelationships between plant performance at nursery and plantation phases \nSeveral measures of growth in the nursery were significantly correlated with subsequent \ngrowth in the plantation (Table 8). SQ was not significantly correlated with any aspect of \nplant growth, whereas DQI was significantly correlated with a number of plant \nparameters. However, a number of simple measures of plant growth in the nursery were \nalso significantly correlated with plantation performance. In particular, root collar \ndiameter in the nursery, a quick and easy non-destructive measure, was as well, or better \ncorrelated with future plant performance as DQI.  Relationships between total plant dry \nweight in the plantation and nursery DQI and rcd are shown in Figure 1. With the \nexception of L. hybrid, grown in sand, a common expression describes the growth of all \nspecies in both substrates.  \n \nDiscussion \n \nDespite the differences in growth in the nursery between nursery substrate and sand, the \nranking of performance of the species in both substrates tended to be similar, with the \ntwo leucaenas performing best, followed by gliricidia, and the two acacia species \nperforming worst. Although plant shoots and roots weighed less, were shorter, and had \nsmaller rcd when grown in sand (Table 3, 4), root length tended to be greater in sand than \nin nursery substrate, indicating that plants responded to this nutrient-poor substrate by \n 11\n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \nproducing a more finely divided root system, providing a greater surface area for uptake \nof nutrients (Balisky et al. 1995; Osmont et al. 2007; Semchenko et al. 2007). Both \nacacias performed relatively poorly in sand in terms of shoot growth, and their root \nsystems appear to have been less adaptable to this substrate (Table 3, 4) than those of the \nother species. Although survival in the nursery was generally good, the poor-growing A. \nangustissima had the lowest survival rate. \n \nHowever, despite the observations in the nursery of the importance of rooting medium to \nplant growth, after 12 months\u2019 growth in the field, all effects of nursery substrate were \nlost. South et al. (2005) also reported that on easy-to regenerate sites, some factors which \naffect nursery growth may not affect seedling survival and growth at plantation phase. \nThe irrigation and the nutrients contained in the waste-water may have contributed to \nimproved growth conditions for the tested species. Many other factors may come into \nplay (Tomlinson et al., 1996; Lindqvist and Ong, 2005) so that final success comes from \na combination of nursery practice and field practice.  \n \nDQI, which is the most complex formula for assessing seedling quality, and which \nincorporates both measures of SQ and SRR was a useful predictor of plantation \nperformance. However, other more straightforward measures were equally good \npredictors of future seedling performance and easier to determine (Table 8). A simple \nnon-destructive measure of root collar diameter for instance, was as good as DQI, which \ninvolves numerous destructive measures for its determination.  \n \n 12\n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \nSQ and SRR showed similar trends for species and substrate factors which were opposite \nto the trend of DQI (Table 5) as also observed by Deans et al. (1989), and reflecting the \nmathematical relationships between these different indices. The morphological attributes \n(low growth values in acacias) did not appear to be in accordance with good quality \nindices (low values SQ and SRR and high values of DQI) for non-irrigated systems. \nHowever, it is not easy to draw a consistent conclusion taking all quality indices together, \nindicating the difficulty of establishing criteria for early selection as also reported by \nprevious workers (Mattsson 1996; Court-Picon et al. 2004). The difficulty in finding a \ngood indicator based on morphological attributes suggests a need for integrated \napproaches and ecophysiological evaluations in correlating seedling vigor with field \nperformance (Mattsson 1996; Davis and Jacobs 2005). Such approaches might also be \nassociated with modeling because effective integration of both physiological and \nmorphological parameters into future models may further benefit seedling quality \nevaluation (Gazal et al. 2004; Davis and Jacobs 2005; Landqvist and Ong 2005).  \n \nIn general, the two leucaenas and G. sepium appeared to be the best seedlings for non-\nirrigated systems in line with the interpretation of others who have worked on such \nsystems (Deans et al. 1989; Bayley and Kietzka 1996; Rawat and Singh 2000; Villar-\nSalvador et al. 2004; Davis and Jacobs 2005). As low shoot:root ratios (large root \nsystems) with subsequent rapid root growth may appear unnecessary and undesirable for \nirrigated conditions,  the two acacias might be considered as the best for irrigated systems \nfollowed by the two leucaenas and G. sepium. At nursery and plantation stages, the two \nacacias displayed the highest SRR values followed by the two leucaenas (Tables 5 and 7). \n 13\n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \nHowever, although nursery SRR was significantly and positively correlated with \nplantation SRR, it was not significantly correlated with other parameters of shoot growth, \nthus it was not a good predictor of plant growth after 12 months in irrigated conditions, \nwhereas DQI was a useful predictor. The effects of combining different species in these \nanalyses may be masking the effects of different nursery management practices. Nursery \nroot collar diameter was an effective predictor of future performance in the plantation, \nconfirming the observations of Mattsson (1996), Rawat and Singh (2000), Davis and \nJacobs (2005) and is a simple non-destructive measure, especially compared with DQI.  \n \nDespite the difficulties of defining morphological attributes which can predict field \nperformance, studies on seedling quality have an important practical application because \nfailure of many reforestation projects in dry areas like Burkina Faso is primarily due to \nplanting of poor quality seedling stocks and poor environmental and soil conditions. In \nsuch situations, careful selection and planting of only viable and vigorous seedlings is \ncrucial to ensure high survival and performance in the field. Thus, a simple and reliable \nnursery grading practice is urgently needed to improve the income generated by \nplantations particularly for irrigated systems where more financial resources have been \ninvested. \n \nPlantations of 14.5 month gave fodder production ranging from 0.18 t ha-1 to 0.31 t ha-1 \nwhile fuelwood production was between 0.42 t ha-1 and 0.98 t ha-1 for the five tested \nspecies (Table 7). These figures are lower than the values reporting by previous workers \n(Mullen and Gutteridge 2002; Chirwa et al., 2003; Kwesiga et al. 2003; Odenyo et al. \n 14\n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \n315 \n316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n331 \n332 \n333 \n2003; Kimaro et al. 2007). This may due to differences in plantation age, soil type, \nmanagement practices, etc. Despite the fact, the two acacias allocated more resources to \ntheir above ground part in comparison with the below ground part, they have produced \nless biomass than the two leucaena and G. sepium (Table 7). Therefore, the three latter \nspecies may also be recommended for irrigated plantation because of the higher biomass \nproduced in comparison with the two acacias. However, the two acacia may also have an \nadvantage in the long run because exporting less nutrients in a production system where \nthe above ground harvested part (leaves and wood) is taking away from the plot leaving \nonly the root system that decay to improve soil carbon and N status (Kimaro et al. 2007).  \n \nAlthough these results demonstrate the benefits of using waste-water for plantations, \nhealth issues must be considered. The use of waste water for production of materials \nwhich enter the food chain requires very careful evaluation due to the possibility of \nintroducing heavy metals and other contaminants. Thus continued analysis of waste \nwater, soils and plant materials must be built in to irrigation systems which rely on waste-\nwater. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe present investigation revealed that not all morphological attributes or ratios are \nsuitable for predicting field performance for a given system and environmental \nconditions. In an irrigated plantation, the effects of the substrate observed at the nursery \nstage  disappeared by 12 months after outplanting due to the availability of water and \n 15\n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \n340 \n341 \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n349 \n350 \n351 \n352 \n353 \n354 \n355 \n356 \nnutrients provided by the irrigation using treated waste water. For such irrigated systems, \nplant root collar diameter and DQI seem to be the most appropriate indicators to predict \nthe outplanting performance of Acacia angustissima, Acacia mangium, Gliricidia sepium, \nLeucaena hybrid, and Leucaena leucocephala in semi-arid Burkina Faso (Figure 1).  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was partly funded by the European Commission, Directorate General XII, \nunder the programme of INCO-DC: International Co-operation with Developing \ncountries through the project UBENEFIT Contract ICA4-2001-10007.
