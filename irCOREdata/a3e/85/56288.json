The range of calcium in water can range from\ntrace levels in soft fresh water to 10 mM in seawater\nand fish that live in those waters are able to retrieve\nmost or all the calcium they need from the surrounding\nwater. Furthermore, many species (e.g. estuarine) have\nthe capacity to rapidly adjust to a wide range of\n* Correspondence: acanario@ualg.pt\n1Centro de Ci\u00eancias do Mar (CCMAR), CIMAR-Laborat\u00f3rio Associado,\nUniversity of Algarve, Campus de Gambelas, 8005-139 Faro, Portugal\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nPinto et al.

The ability of\nteleost fishes to maintain circulating calcium [Ca2+]\nwithin narrow limits is well documented [4-6] and is\nmediated by rapid rate changes of water and calcium\nexchange in gill, intestine, kidney and skin epithelia\n[reviewed in [3]].\nThe gill epithelium is the main site of active Ca2+\nuptake from the water at low [Ca2+], while at higher\n[Ca2+], such as in seawater (SW), the intestine acquires\nalso an important role [3,7]. The gill, together with the\nkidney, also appears to play a role in Ca2+ excretion but\nlittle is known about this process [3,8]. Branchial Ca2+\nuptake appears to occur mainly through specialized\nmitochondrion-rich cells (MR cells) or \u201cchloride cells\u201d\nfollowing a 3-step process similar to that proposed for\nCa2+ reabsorption in the mammalian kidney: passive\nentry of Ca2+ through apical epithelial Ca2+ channels\n(e.g. ECaC); transcellular transport in the cytoplasm or\nsequestration in organelles through binding to Ca2\n+-binding proteins (CaBPs); and active basolateral extru-\nsion to the blood via a plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase\n(PMCA) or a Na+\/Ca2+-exchanger (NCX) [3,9]. When\nfish are exposed to low or high calcium environments,\nthey respond by modifying gill Ca2+ uptake; altering the\nnumber, area and morphology of MR cells, gene expres-\nsion of epithelial calcium channel (ecac) and other\nosmoregulatory mediators [10-13]. However, there is\nstill relatively little knowledge of the gill molecular\nmachinery involved in the adjustments to changes in\n[Ca2+], in particular the early events.\nFinally, the internal and external Ca2+ sensing\nmechanisms (e.g. via a membrane calcium-sensing\nreceptor, CaSR), intracellular signaling and the endo-\ncrine control of Ca2+ balance in fish, which differs from\nthat of terrestrial animals, have been the subject of sev-\neral physiological studies and recent reviews [3,14-17],\nbut much remains to be discovered about their mechan-\nisms of action and target genes in Ca2+-transporting\nepithelia.\nThis study sought to detail the cellular mechanisms\nand determine the genes involved in the rapid percep-\ntion, signal transduction and effector responses of tele-\nost fish gills to changes in environmental Ca2+. To this\nend, we analyzed the gill transcriptome of the green\nspotted puffer fish (Tetraodon nigroviridis) soon after\ntransfer from brackish water (10 ppt salinity, 2.9 mM\nCa2+) to brackish water containing 0.01 and 10 mM Ca2\n+. The [Ca2+] tested cover the range teleost fish are gen-\nerally exposed to in nature: from 0.01 mM in ion-poor\nfresh water to 10 mM in sea water [3]. The choice of\ntime points analyzed after transfer (2 and 12 h) sought\nto capture the early transcriptomic responses of the\nacclimation process. T. nigroviridis was chosen as the\nexperimental model because of two main reasons: 1) it\nis euryhaline and able to tolerate wide variations in\nwater [Ca2+] (can be found in freshwater (FW) streams\nand rivers, estuaries and coastal waters [18] and in\nexperimental conditions tolerate direct transfers from\nFW to SW and vice-versa [19]), and 2) its genome and\nmany cDNAs have been sequenced [20], facilitating\ngene identification from sequenced data. The gill tran-\nscriptomic responses were obtained using a variation of\nserial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) [21] desig-\nnated SuperSAGE, a global and quantitative transcrip-\ntomic technique based on high throughput sequencing\nand counting of small transcript-identifier tags, 26-bp\ninstead of 14-bp in SAGE. The larger SuperSAGE tags\nresults in improvements in tag-to-gene annotation (gene\nidentification) and characterization of identified tags\n[22,23], and has been adapted to massively parallel pyro-\nsequencing using a bar-code system which simplifies the\nprocedure and permits higher throughput [24].\nAs a result of transfer of T. nigroviridis from water\ncontaining 2.9 mM Ca2+ to water containing 0.01 and\n10 mM Ca2+ 1,339 differentially expressed gill tran-\nscripts were identified and clustered into sub-groups of\ngenes with distinct patterns of expression. Gene ontol-\nogy (GO) enrichment analysis of the annotated tags\nallowed the identification of biological processes, func-\ntions and cell compartments that were most affected.\nRelative expression changes in 8 genes were also com-\npared by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The data obtained in\nthis study provide the first comprehensive catalogue of\ngenes implicated in the rapid acclimation responses of\nfish gill cells to changes in water Ca2+ availability.\nResults\nTotal plasma calcium and Ca2+ channel gene expression\nTransfer of T. nigroviridis from water containing 2.9 mM\nCa2+ to water containing 0.01 (LowCa) and 10 mM Ca2+\n(HighCa) resulted, respectively, in a small decrease and\nincrease in blood plasma total [Ca2+], both at 2 and 12 h,\nwhich was significantly different between the two experi-\nmental groups (Figure 1). At the same time the expres-\nsion level of gill epithelial calcium channel mRNA (ecac,\nofficial name trpv6) changed in the opposite direction,\ni.e., up-regulation in LowCa and down-regulation in\nHighCa which were statistically significant (P < 0.05)\nbetween these experimental groups 12 h after transfer.\nThe expression of CaSR transcripts was also detected at\nvery low levels in the gills of all experimental groups by\nquantitative real-time (q) PCR (and by SuperSAGE in the\nLowCa2 h library, one tag with count 1), but no changes\nin gene expression in response to water [Ca2+] were\ndetected (not shown). These results are in agreement\nwith previous studies [10-13,25] and confirmed that the\nexperimental approach induced a challenge to calcium\nbalance mechanisms in T. nigroviridis gills.\nPinto et al.

Stringent quality control of ditag sequences\nyielded 344,375 26 bp-SuperSAGE mono-tags which\nwere retained for further analysis (Table 1).

BMC Genomics 2010, 11:476\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/11\/476\nPage 3 of 21\nIn order to eliminate genes potentially responding to\nhandling stress (given the relatively brief duration of\nexperimental exposure), the gill expression profiles of\nCa2+ challenged libraries were always compared to the\ngill profile of fish transferred to control water at the cor-\nresponding time-point (control libraries), while two\ntypes of statistical tests and multiple library comparisons\n(see methods) were also carried out to increase strin-\ngency and to account for time-effects. A total of 1,426\nunique tags (transcripts) showing differential expression\nbetween control and [Ca2+] treatments were identified\nof which 1,339 were up- or down-regulated at least 2-\nfold and selected for further analyses.\nTag annotation\nThe annotation of the differentially expressed tags was\ncarried out by BlastN mapping to available DNA\nsequences for this species, followed by BlastX assign-\nment of these longer (tag-matching) cDNAs or 1000-bp\nDNA fragments (extracted upstream from the tag-\nmatching sites in the genome) to the highly curated\nnon-redundant Swiss-Prot protein database.\nIn the BlastN step, carried out under high stringency\n(26\/26 nucleotide matches), 516 tags (38.5%) matched to\none or more cDNAs available in GenBank (NCBI\ncDNAs), 243 tags (18.1%) matched cDNAs predicted\nfrom the T.nigroviridis genome (Ensembl cDNAs) and\n692 tags (51.7%) matched the genome (Additional file\n1), making a total of 869 tags with a DNA match to\navailable T.nigroviridis DNA datasets (Table 2). Three\nhundred and fifty three tags (26.4%) mapped only to the\ngenome or Ensembl genome predicted cDNAs (Addi-\ntional file 1) and may represent novel transcripts. It was\nnot possible to calculate the rate of unambiguous tag\nmapping to unique transcripts, since the available cDNA\ndataset contained multiple redundant expressed\nsequence tags (ESTs) and no unigene [27] dataset is\navailable for T.nigroviridis. However, only a reduced\nnumber of tags matched more than one location in the\ngenome (28 tags, 4%), suggesting unambiguous annota-\ntion for most 26-bp tags.\nFour hundred and seventy differentially expressed tags\n(35.1%) could not be mapped to any available DNA\nsequence and may represent genes or splice variant\ntranscripts not previously covered by the sequencing of\ngenomic and expressed sequence tag (EST) data.\nDepending on the DNA dataset, lowering stringency to\n24\/24 nucleotide matches improved annotation up to\n19% (Additional file 2), suggesting that some tags\ncontain nucleotide mismatches to available DNAs,\npotentially derived from sequencing errors or single-\nnucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in transcript\nsequences. However, even in these circumstances 60%\n(279) of the non-annotated tags could not be assigned,\nsupporting the notion that they are not represented in\navailable sequence databases. Therefore the 26\/26 (per-\nfect match) stringency rule was maintained in this analy-\nsis to ensure a less ambiguous annotation of\ndifferentially expressed tags.\nIn the second step of annotation (BlastX of tag-match-\ning DNAs), the following preference order was used\nwhen assigning a protein ID for the tags matching dif-\nferent DNA datasets: the NCBI cDNA BlastX hit was\nused preferably compared to Ensembl cDNA hits (which\nare predicted cDNAs lacking verification of structure\nand expression), and only when no tag-matching\ncDNAs were available or no significant BlastX hit\noccurred (significance at expect value, E < 10-5) was\ngenomic match used. This choice was supported by the\nlower BlastX annotation rate for genomic 1000-bp frag-\nments (28.2%) compared to NCBI and Ensembl cDNAs\n(>70%; Additional file 1), perhaps as a result of introns,\nregions with low sequencing quality or errors in assem-\nbly in genomic sequences. Nevertheless, significant\nBlastX hits for tags matching more than one DNA data-\nset (223 tags) were found to have the same annotation\nin 186 cases (83.4%), to belong to the same protein\nfamily in 32 cases (14.4%) and to differ only in 5 cases\n(2.2%).

The number of dif-\nferent genes identified (413) was lower than the number\nof tags annotated to protein, as 54 genes (13.1%) had\nmultiple tags assigned to the same gene (average 1.2 dif-\nferentially expressed tags per gene, maximum 7), sug-\ngesting they were products of sequence polymorphisms\nand\/or alternative mRNA processing (i.e., produced by\nalternative splicing or use of alternative polyadenylation\nsites, which may affect the position of the most 3\u2019-end\nNlaIII site and thus generate different tags). In addition,\n43 (8.6%) of the annotated differentially expressed tags\nand 37 of the genes (9%) were identified as putatively\nderived from natural antisense RNA transcripts, as they\nhad an inverted match to a sense cDNA or a direct\nmatch to an antisense cDNA.\nMost up- or down-regulated tags\nWe first looked at the 10 transcripts that underwent the\nlargest up- or down-regulatory change for each challenge\nthat could be annotated to well characterized genes\n(Table 3, see Additional file 3 for all differentially\nexpressed transcripts). These included transcripts for a\nrange of calcium-binding proteins or participants in\nCaBP protein complexes involved in muscle contraction\nor cytoskeleton organization, such as actn3, mle3, mlrs,\ntnni2, tpm1, prvb and telt, which were rapidly and\nstrongly up-regulated in gills of fish exposed to water\nwith low [Ca2+]. Two genes, entk (involved in proteolysis)\nand rl11 (translation), were among the top 10 up-regu-\nlated transcripts at 12 h for both LowCa and HighCa,\nwhile co8a1 (an extracellular matrix constituent) and\nfrim (iron ion oxidation and transport) were among the\nmost down-regulated for both LowCa and HighCa, sug-\ngesting that some common mechanisms were activated.\nClustering of expression patterns and enriched gene\nontology\nK-means clustering was used to group transcripts\naccording to their patterns of expression between con-\ntrol and low Ca2+ water over time (LowCa analysis) and\nacross the three Ca2+ availability conditions at 12 h\n(12 h analysis, to compare the effects of high vs. low\nCa2+ water challenges).\nFor each analysis, six clusters (optimal number of K =\n6 obtained by Gap statistics) were obtained (Figure 2A\nand 2B), containing 192 \u00b1 44 (mean \u00b1 standard devia-\ntion) tags each, which showed clear distinguishable pat-\nterns between them. Since most transcripts were\ncommon to both analyses, the number of tags common\nbetween clusters of the two analyses is also represented\nin Figure 2C. To understand the biological significance\nof the identified differentially expressed transcripts, the\ngene ontology [28] terms (GO) significantly enriched in\nthe whole lists of differential expressed tags or in each\nof the clusters compared to the normal gill transcrip-\ntome (i.e., the annotated SuperSAGE profiles obtained\nin control water at 2 and\/or 12 h) were identified and\nare listed in Additional files 4 and 5.\nThe biological process categories most significantly\nover-represented in the global lists of differentially\nexpressed tags were mainly related to muscle contrac-\ntion and cytoskeleton: categories \u201cregulation of muscle\ncontraction\u201d, \u201cmuscle contraction\u201d and \u201ccytokinesis\u201d for\nboth LowCa and 12 h analysis; the \u201cpositive\/negative\nregulation of ATPAse activity\u201d and \u201cresponse to calcium\nion\u201d in the LowCa list and the \u201cactin filament-based\nmovement\u201d in the 12 h list. The \u201cphosphocreatine bio-\nsynthetic process\u201d, involved in cellular energy homeosta-\nsis, was enriched in LowCa at 2 but not in the global 12\nh list. Among the enriched molecular functions in both\nanalyses were the \u201cstructural constituent of muscle\u201d and\n\u201cmotor activity categories\u201d, while the \u201ccalcium channel\nregulator activity\u201d was enriched in the LowCa list;\nfinally, enriched cellular components included \u201csarco-\nmer\u201d, \u201cmyofibril\u201d and the troponin\/myosin complexes.\nEnriched categories in the \u201cLowCa analysis\u201d\nWhen detailing the expression patterns of transcript tags\nwhose expression was altered by water with low [Ca2+],\ncluster 6, grouping 223 tags with a strong up-regulation\nat 2 h but not at 12 h (Figure 2A), had the highest num-\nber of enriched categories (273) with the highest signifi-\ncance probabilities (adjusted p value down to 10-52) and\nwas the main contributor to enrichment in the global\nlist of differentially expressed transcripts (containing\n89% of the enriched categories in the global LowCa list,\nAdditional file 4). This suggests a strong coordinated\nresponse of functionally related genes in response to the\nLowCa stimulus at 2 h. Enriched biological processes\nwere mainly related to Ca2+ signaling or homeostasis,\nmuscle contraction and cytoskeleton, including all the\ncategories indicated above plus specific categories such\nas \u201ccalcium-mediated signaling\u201d, \u201ccalcium ion homeosta-\nsis\u201d and \u201cactin cytoskeleton reorganization\u201d. Transcripts\ngrouped in this cluster and responsible for the enrich-\nment in these categories include actin a skeletal muscle\n(acts), several myosin (myss, mle3, myl4, mlrs) and tro-\nponin forms (tnnc1, tnnc2, tnni1, tnni2, tnni3, tnnt2,\ntnnt3), a-tropomyosin (tpm1), the sarcoplasmic\/endo-\nplasmic reticulum (SR\/ER) calcium ATPase 1 (at2a1 or\nserca1), the sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase\n(kcrs) and creatine kinase muscle type 1 (kcrm1). Glu-\ncose metabolism also appears to have been affected in\nLowCa, with \u201cgluconeogenesis\u201d enriched in this cluster\n(e.g. genes f16p2 and g3p), as well as up-regulation of\ngenes involved in glycolysis, such as aldoa, enob and\nPinto et al.

This suggests an increase in the conversion of non-\ncarbohydrate substrates (e.g. amino acids or lipids) into\nglucose and glucose oxidation, probably to meet the\nenergetic needs of the acclimation response.\nIn addition to several molecular functions related to\nmuscle contraction\/cytoskeleton (Additional file 4), the\n\u201ccalcium ion binding\u201d category was enriched, with half of\nthe CaBPs identified grouping in this cluster. The \u201ccrea-\ntine kinase activity\u201d (involved in cellular ATP homeosta-\nsis) was also enriched with several creatine kinase genes\ngrouping in the cluster (kcrb, kcrf, kcrm1, kcrs), and\nenriched cellular components included sarcomer, tropo-\nnin and myosin complexes, myofibril and cytoskeleton.\nChanges in expression of 30% of the differentially\nexpressed transcript tags in cluster 6 appear to be speci-\nfic to the early-response to LowCa, as they did not meet\nthe criteria for the 12 h differential expression among\nwater types (Figure 2C).\nCluster LowCa-3 contains 106 transcript tags also up-\nregulated by LowCa but only after 12 h (Figure 2A).\nCytoskeleton remodeling appears to be induced also at\n12 h, with enrichment in \u201cintermediate filament-based\nprocess\u201d and up-regulation of keratin 13 (k1c13) and the\nintermediate filament protein ON3 (ion3), while \u201cglu-\ntathione transferase activity\u201d was also enriched (genes\ngsta and mgst3), suggesting an increase in detoxification\nactivity. Most transcripts in this cluster (66%, e.g. k1c13\nand ion3) fall into cluster 4 of the 12 h analysis (Figure\n2C), indicating they were regulated by LowCa but not\nHighCa at the 12 h exposure, while 29% (e.g. gsta and\nmgst3) were also regulated by HighCa (cluster 12 h-6).\nCluster LowCa-2 includes transcripts up-regulated by\nLowCa at both 2 and 12 h (Figure 2A), mainly enriched\nin categories related to energy generation such as \u201cmito-\nchondrial electron transport, NADH to ubiquinone\u201d,\n\u201cATP synthesis coupled electron transport\u201d, \u201cNADH\ndehydrogenase (ubiquinone) activity\u201d, \u201cmitochondrion\u201d,\nand contains transcripts for several NADH dehydro-\ngenases and NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductases. Thirty\neight percent of the cluster transcripts (including nu2 m\nand nua4l) showed a general up-regulation by both low\nand high calcium challenges (cluster 12 h-6, Figure 2).\nInterestingly, clusters LowCa-1 and -5 grouped tags\nwith changing expression levels in the control water over\ntime (Figure 2A), but down-regulated by LowCa at 2 or\n12 h, respectively. Whether or not these patterns of tem-\nporal variation in expression in control water reflect a\nresponse to stress, a natural control by circadian rhythms\n(our sampling times of 2 or 12 h coincided with the\nbeginning and end of the light period, at 8 a.m. and\n8 p.m., respectively) or other type of control remains to\nbe determined. Cluster 1 was enriched in the biological\nprocesses \u201cmitotic G2 checkpoint\u201d and included genes\nrelated to cell division such as ccnd2, and \u201cdefense\nresponse\u201d (e.g. genes ha2b, hg2a), while cluster 5 was\nenriched in the processes \u201cresponse to unfolded protein\u201d,\n\u201csleep\u201d, \u201cresponse to UV\u201d and \u201cpositive regulation of Wnt\nreceptor signaling pathway\u201d (genes hsp71, grp78). Ninety\npercent of the transcripts in cluster LowCa-5 were down-\nregulated by both Low and HighCa water at 12 h and fell\ninto clusters 1 or 5 from the 12 h analysis (Figure 2B and\n2C).

Cluster 5\nis enriched in \u201cregulation of striated muscle contraction\u201d\n(genes tnni1, tnnt3) while cluster 6 is enriched in \u201ccol-\nlagen catabolic process\u201d, containing genes for proteases\nsuch as pepd but also one collagen form, co8a1. Cluster\n2 includes transcripts only up-regulated by HighCa at\n12 h but not by LowCa, 43% of which are also not regu-\nlated by LowCa in the 2 h exposure time (Figure 2A, B\nand 2C). However, no GO category was significantly\nenriched in this cluster, indicating that it contains a het-\nerogeneous group of non-functionally related genes.\nExamples of genes only up-regulated by HighCa include\nubiquitin (ubiq, proteolysis), the GTP-binding nuclear\nprotein Ran (ran, nucleocytoplasmatic transport) and\nserine\/threonine-protein kinase sgk1 (stress response\nand negative regulation of apoptosis).\nCluster 3, containing genes down-regulated by HighCa\nat 12 h but not (or only slightly) by LowCa is signifi-\ncantly enriched in 124 categories (Additional file 4), 66%\nof which were also enriched in cluster LowCa-6, such as\n\u201cmuscle contraction\u201d, \u201ccytokinesis\u201d, \u201cpositive regulation\nof ATPAse activity\u201d, \u201cactin filament-based movement\u201d\nand \u201cphosphocreatine biosynthetic process\u201c\/\u201dcreatine\nkinase activity\u201d. This result indicates a difference in the\nresponses to low or high Ca2+, with the same processes\nthat were up-regulated in LowCa at 2 h being down-\nregulated in HighCa at 12 h (although we do not know\nif they were regulated in HighCa at 2 h, since this group\nwas not included in the study). Specific categories\nenriched in this cluster compared to clusters of the\nLowCa analysis include \u201cprotein secretion\u201d, \u201ccell moti-\nlity\u201d or \u201cephrin receptor signaling pathway\u201d (with down-\nregulation of the ephrin type-A receptor 2, epha2, and\nthe proto oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase yrk).\nDifferential transcript expression of proteins from\nselected functional groups\nTo focus on the effects of water Ca2+ availability on the\ngill intracellular signaling machinery and on the gill\neffector mechanisms, we highlight in Table 4 five\nselected functional categories and related genes that\nwere identified as differentially expressed through tran-\nscript tag annotation. Thirty genes (41 transcripts)\nencoded different CaBPs and mainly grouped to clusters\nLowCa-6 (51%) and -4 (24%), indicating that the expres-\nsion of most identified CaBPs was rapidly up-regulated\nin response to LowCa water (e.g. calsequestrin, parval-\nbumin b and several myosin forms), while 19% was\ndown-regulated by HighCa at 12 h (cluster 12 h-3, e.g.\ncalsequestrin). One tag mapping to the important intra-\ncellular Ca2+-sensing and signal transduction protein\ncalmodulin (CaM) was slightly (1.5-1.7-fold) but signifi-\ncantly (p < 0.05) down-regulated by LowCa at both 2\nand 12 h, but is not included in our dataset of differen-\ntially expressed transcripts as its expression ratios are\nbelow our cut-off value of 2-fold.\nFourteen genes for transcription factors were regulated\nby Ca2+ with a variety of induction profiles (up or\ndown-regulation by Low or HighCa), while 14 additional\nregulators of transcription were identified, most of\nwhich with a rapid response to LowCa (43% in cluster\nLowCa-6). A large number of transcripts for compo-\nnents of intracellular signaling pathways were also iden-\ntified (54 differentially expressed transcripts, 47 different\ngenes) with varying expression patterns (Table 4, Addi-\ntional file 3).\nEighteen genes (23 transcripts) coding for ion trans-\nporters\/ion homeostasis regulators and other proteins\ndescribed to influence ionic changes in gills were identi-\nfied among the differentially expressed transcripts\n(Table 4), including five tags matching members from\nthe claudin (CLDN) superfamily of transmembrane tight\njunction proteins. Annotation of these and 63 additional\n(non-differentially expressed) cldn transcript tags via\nSwiss-Prot BlastX mainly matched mammalian claudins\n3 and 4, but it was not possible to distinguish between\nfish claudin paralogues, as this gene family has been lar-\ngely expanded in teleost fishes [29]. Cldn tags were thus\nannotated by comparison with F. rubripes proteins,\nallowing the assignment of differential expression to fish\ncldn3a, cldn28a, cldn32a and cldn8d genes [following\nthe nomenclature established in 29]. Similarly, a tran-\nscript for an aquaporin form has been annotated to fish\naqp3, using BlastX against fish proteins only.\nQuantitative PCR of differentially expressed genes\nThe same mRNAs used for SuperSAGE were individu-\nally analyzed by qPCR for eight genes detected to be dif-\nferentially expressed by SuperSAGE. Gene selection took\ninto consideration the coverage of a wide range of tran-\nscript (tag) abundance and patterns of differential\nexpression (Additional file 6). It also included genes\ncontaining a variable number of alternative tags\nPinto et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:476\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/11\/476\nPage 9 of 21\nalthough qPCR primers were not designed to distinguish\nalternative transcripts. A statistically significant positive\ncorrelation was obtained between the SuperSAGE\nexpression (sum of counts of all tags matching each\ngene) and qPCR expression levels (relative to rps18) for\n5 of the genes tested (see Additional file 6). Further-\nmore, there was a highly significant positive correlation\n(r = 0.932, p = 3.7 \u00d7 10-11) for the relative expression of\nthe 8 genes relative to control (Figure 3) between qPCR\nand SuperSAGE, indicating an overall concordance\nbetween the two techniques in detecting differential\nexpression.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide tran-\nscriptome profile of gill tissue to water Ca2+ availability,\nand the deepest gill transcriptome study to date, identi-\nfying differential expression in 1,339 out of 79,367 dif-\nferent transcripts analyzed. Other studies have analyzed\ngill transcriptomic changes in response to different chal-\nlenges such as osmotic stress, heat stress, hypoxia or\ninfection by parasites [30-33], but the depth of analysis\nwas much lower (maximum 16,000 different cDNA\nclones analyzed) and none was concerned with\nresponses to calcium per se.\nThree notes of caution should be considered in the\ninterpretation of these results. First, the gill is a hetero-\ngeneous, multifunctional organ composed by several\ntypes of cells and tissues (epithelial, neural, muscular\/\nvascular and bony\/cartilaginous) [8] and the expression\nprofiles produced can result from any calcium respon-\nsive cell type. Confirmation of the hypotheses generated\nby these data as being specific genes to Ca2+ uptake\/\nhomeostasis requires confirmation by specific experi-\nments, with focus on the gill epithelial MR cells, consid-\nered the primary site of active Ca2+ uptake in this tissue\nand where most significant changes are expected to\noccur [3,7]. Second, gene ontology enrichment analysis\nis mainly based on the annotation and comparison of\nlists of differentially expressed genes with data that is\nbiased towards a few (mainly mammalian) model organ-\nisms and the involvement of a particular protein in bio-\nlogical processes in fish may differ from that in those\nspecies [34]. Third, in common with other transcrip-\ntomic studies the produced gene sets are based on\naltered levels of mRNA and assume parallel, but not\nconfirmed, changes in protein abundance [34].\nBecause T. nigroviridis does not normally live in\nwaters containing 0.01 mM Ca2+, it could be questioned\nwhether some of the transcriptomic changes reflect\nacute stress induced by the low [Ca2+] itself. This is\nunlikely since the \u201cresponse to stress\u201d biological function\ncategory was not enriched among the differentially\nexpressed genes. Furthermore, of 41 proteins included\nin \u201cresponse to stress\u201d in the global data set only five\n(Serine\/threonine-protein kinase Sgk1, Serine\/threonine-\nprotein kinase Sgk3, Heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein,\nHeat shock 70 kDa protein 1 and two isoforms of tele-\nthonin were differentially expressed, each in a different\ncluster and equally represented as up-regulated in\nLowCa at 2 h and 12 h and HighCa at 12 h (additional\nfile 3).\nPlasma total calcium and gill expression of ecac\nT. nigroviridis exposed to lower [Ca2+] had lower total\ncalcium plasma levels than those exposed to high [Ca2+]\nat both 2 h and 12 h post-transfer (Figure 1), indicating\na short-term dependence of total circulating levels on\nexternal [Ca2+], as observed in other fish species\n[7,35,36]. These changes are likely the result of the coor-\ndinated action of the gill, intestine and kidney, with\ndecreased gill calcium uptake in LowCa water. This is\nsupported by the up-regulation of the (apical side)\nepithelial Ca2+ channel (ecac) mRNA detected by qPCR\nat 12 h (Figure 1) which suggests that this compensatory\neffector mechanism was activated in order to increase\ntransepithelial Ca2+ transport and restore Ca2+ homeos-\ntasis. The counteracting mechanism was also observed\nin HighCa water with ecac mRNA expression down-\nregulated. The plasma calcium and ecac response to\nchanging water calcium are similar to what has been\npreviously described in other fish species [10-13] and\nacted as a positive control in our experiment.\nGlobal Analysis of SAGE data\nWith approximately 70,000 transcripts analyzed per\nlibrary and assuming around 300,000 transcripts are\nexpressed per cell [26,37], our analysis provides ~1-fold\ncoverage for transcripts expressed at >0.9 copies per cell\nand thus the produced profiles are comprehensive of the\ngill transcriptome. The tag extraction yield was 57% and\napproximately 70% of the unitags were singletons. These\nstatistics are in agreement with other reports using the\nsame methodology [26,37].\nThe rate of annotation was high with 65% of the 1,339\ndifferentially expressed SuperSAGE tags which could be\nannotated (57% of which matched known proteins). The\nspecificity of tag mapping (only 2-4% tags mapped to\nmultiple genomic locations) was also high and within\nthe level expected for 26-bp tags [38]. The assignment\nof multiple tags to 13.1% of the genes annotated high-\nlights the capacity of SAGE to detect and discriminate a\ndiversity of mRNA transcripts [22,26,39,40]. However,\nfor 470 tags (35%), some of which among the top 10\nmost-differentially expressed tags for each challenge, no\nDNA or protein could be assigned. These results also\nreflect the capacity of SAGE to identify novel transcripts\nwith potential relevance to the physiological process in\nPinto et al.

Some of the\nsame genes were down-regulated 12 h after exposure to\nhigh [Ca2+].\nThe concerted altered expression of those genes sug-\ngests that cytoskeletal modulation and\/or cell prolifera-\ntion are part of the process of acclimation of T.\nnigroviridis gills to changed [Ca2+]. Furthermore, it is\npossible that MR cells are key elements of these\nchanges, since several studies have shown modifications\nto the MR machinery in the gill and skin epithelia in\nseveral fish species in response to manipulations of\nenvironmental [Ca2+] [48-52]. An important role for\ncytoskeletal actin in the MR cell short-term response to\nsalinity change was previously suggested [53], since dis-\nruption of actin polymerization was able to block the\nrapid apical crypt closing in response to hypotonic\nshock, while a thick annular actin ring was detected at\nthe opening of these crypts in MR cells and was sug-\ngested to control its opening\/closure [54,55]. Although\nother explanations cannot be excluded, this could indi-\ncate that the transcriptomic changes we observed may\nbe, at least to some extent, part of a common response\nto situations challenging ion homeostasis (such as sali-\nnity changes and specific changes in [Ca2+], [Na+] or\nboth) in which cell number, area and morphology of gill\nepithelial cells (particularly the specialized ion transport-\ning MR cells) are modified with consequent modulation\nof ion fluxes [e.g. [46,54,56]]. While most studies dealt\nwith long-term acclimation periods of days or weeks,\nthere are also reports showing MR morphological\/prolif-\nerative modifications shortly after the challenge [e.g.,\n[45-47]]. Additionally, other components of the cytoske-\nleton were also regulated by low or high Ca2+ levels,\nincluding proteins forming the intermediate filaments\n(several cytokeratins and ION3) and the microtubule\ncomponent b5-tubulin, consistent with a proposed role\nfor the MR cell microtubule network in Ca2+ uptake in\ntilapia larvae [57]. Thus, the role of the cytoskeleton and\nthe underlying processes during the early cellular adjust-\nments of MR cells to ion (in particular calcium) and\nosmotic regulation should be further investigated.\nTranscriptional changes of the actin cytoskeleton\ncomponents could be also linked to changes in the\nstructure and organization of the gills. Muscle cells are\npresent in the gill vasculature and in adductor\/abductor\nmuscles that control the angle between gill filaments\n[8,58] and up-regulation of cytoskeletal actin, troponin\nand myosin complexes, and myofibril in low calcium\nmay reflect the key role of Ca2+ in muscle contraction.\nIndeed, the concomitant up-regulation of cytoplasmatic\nCaBP PVB, creatine kinase, Ca2+ pump AT2A1 and the\nenzyme CKM1, all described to play a role in muscle\nrelaxation [59,60], suggest a coordinated action in mus-\ncle function and\/or cytoskeleton reorganization in gill\ntissue.\nCalcium ion homeostasis\nOne of the most enriched GO categories induced by low\nwater Ca2+ availability was, as expected, calcium-ion\nhomeostasis. A rapid up-regulation after 2 h exposure to\nLowCa water was detected for AT2A1 (SERCA1), the\nCa2+ pump responsible for re-sequestration of Ca2+ into\nthe SR\/ER that, together with SR\/ER Ca2+-release chan-\nnels and cytoplasmatic\/ER luminal CABPs, allow the\ntight regulation of cytosolic [Ca2+] in numerous cell\ntypes [61]. In addition, several genes for Ca2+-buffering\nCABPs were also up-regulated by LowCa water after 2 h\n(Table 4), including the ER lumen CaBPs calsequestrin-\n1 and sarcalumenin, or the cytosolic CaBPs parvalbumin\nb and ictacalcin [59,61], revealing for the first time a\ntight and rapid up-regulation of several elements of the\nFigure 3 Relationship between relative change of gene\nexpression measured by qPCR and SuperSAGE.

Whether the detected changes\nin expression are a general cellular response of fish gill\nto low calcium and\/or are more specifically related to\nthe Ca2+ uptake pathway to maintain body calcium bal-\nance remains to be determined. However, the current\naccepted model for transepithelial Ca2+ uptake across\nfish gill MR cells includes a transcellular transport step\nof Ca2+ bound to CaBPs, such as Ca2+-calmodulin, par-\nvalbumin and ictacalcin, through the cytoplasm or its\nsequestration into organelles (mainly the ER) [62,63].\nThe up-regulation after 2 h exposure to LowCa water of\na number of CaBPs previously identified as Ca2+-buffers\nsupports their possible role in Ca2+ uptake across fish\ngills, a hypothesis that may be validated by confirming\nthese transcriptional changes specifically in the gill MR\nepithelial cells responsible for Ca2+ uptake.\nCa2+ sensing and signal transduction\nVery low and unchanging gene expression levels of cal-\ncium sensing receptor (CaSR), the membrane receptor\nwhich senses extracellular calcium levels, were detected\nby qPCR and SuperSAGE (not shown). CaSR has been\npreviously localized to the MR cells in fish gill epithelia\nand shown to activate phospholipase C and mitogen-\nactivated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in response\nto external [Ca2+] changes [16]. Our results are consis-\ntent with reports in which the mRNA and protein\nexpression of CaSR were unaffected by calcium con-\nstraint (in water or food) or by salinity changes [4,64].\nSuperSAGE detected the differential expression of a\nlarge number of CaBPs (Table 4), including four pro-\nteins from the S-100 family (HORN, S10A5, S10AD and\nS10I), 75% of which were up-regulated after 2 h expo-\nsure to low water [Ca2+], while CaM was down-regu-\nlated at both 2 and 12 h. The immediate early gene\nresponse (induction at <2 h) response of these CaBP\ngenes support the notion that they may be part of an\nintracellular Ca2+ sensor network [65,66] in fish gills\ninvolved in the initial perception of Ca2+ availability and\nin the consequent activation of signaling pathways and\ntarget proteins.\nIon and water homeostasis\nOnly a small number of ion channel and transporter\ngenes were found (Table 4) and no differential expres-\nsion of transporters such as pmca or ncx was detected.\nThis is in agreement with the theory that ECaC is the\nonly (or main) plasma membrane Ca2+ transporter regu-\nlated by environmental [Ca2+] in gills, while the steady\nstate expressions of PMCA and NCX may accommodate\nthe needs for transepithelial Ca2+ transport under differ-\nent [Ca2+] [10]. However, it is also possible that the\nexchange activities of these and other transporters (and\nnot their mRNA expression levels) are modulated by\n[Ca2+] through Ca2+ sensing\/signaling mechanisms, such\nas the above mentioned activation by CaBPs or cytoske-\nleton reorganization. For instance, the main factors reg-\nulating PMCA activity in eukaryotes appear to be Ca2\n+-bound CaM and phosphorylation by protein kinases\nA\/C, but recent evidence in human erythrocyte mem-\nbranes also point to effects of the interaction with actin\ncytoskeleton elements on PMCA activity [67,68].\nAdditional ion homeostasis related genes were found\nto be significantly regulated by water Ca2+ levels (Table\n4), including four members of the large multi-gene\nfamily of tight-junction proteins claudins (CLDNs),\nwhich have been implicated in the maintenance of\nhydromineral balance across osmoregulatory epithelia of\neuryhaline fishes [33,69-73]. It has been suggested that a\ndecline in their expression may be related to the reshap-\ning of the gill epithelia of euryhaline fish upon SW-\nacclimation and account for its \u201cleakier\u201d (higher ion\npermeability) properties. For example, both cldn8d and\ncldn3a expression were reduced in a salinity-dependent\nmanner during T. nigroviridis acclimation for 2 weeks to\nFW and SW [69,70]. In tilapia and flounder gills\nCLDN3 proteins were reduced 4-8 days after FW-SW\ntransfer and increased after SW-FW transfer [71,73]. In\nour study a decrease in cldn8d gill mRNA expression\nwas detected after 12 h exposure to low and high [Ca2+]\nwater compared to control water, while the expression\nof cldn3a was rapidly up-regulated by low [Ca2+] at 2 h\nand unchanged in both low and high [Ca2+] water at 12\nh post-transfer. As for cldn28a and 28b no overall\neffects of FW-SW transfers were observed in salmon or\ntilapia [71,72], but an up-regulation of cldn28a was\ndetected in SW-FW tilapia 1-7 days post-transfer [71].\nIn our study cldn28b was also unaffected by water [Ca2\n+] and the slight down-regulation of cldn28a detected\nby SuperSAGE in LowCa at 2 h was not confirmed by\nqPCR. Finally, differential expression was detected for\ntwo alternative tags annotated to the fish cldn32a iso-\nform, one of the fish cldn genes whose orthologs appear\nto have been lost in the mammalian lineage [29], and\nthese results provide the first evidence for regulation of\nits gill mRNA levels in response to water ion availability.\nAltogether, these observations suggest short-term altera-\ntions in paracellular epithelial permeability, the details\nof which are not very well known.\nTwo tags annotated to a carbonic anhydrases (Table\n4) were up-regulated in LowCa but not HighCa, consis-\ntent with the reported up-regulation of CAH1 and\nCAH2 mRNA in zebra fish gills after 5-6 days exposure\nto soft-water [12]. Cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrases in\ngills may assist in apical ion uptake by providing HCO3\n-\nfor apical Cl-\/HCO3\n- exchanger or protons for apical\nNa+\/H+ exchanger [12]. Their up-regulation suggests an\nPinto et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:476\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/11\/476\nPage 14 of 21\nimpact of Ca2+ availability in the gill uptake of other\nions.\nFinally, one tag for the water pore aqp3, a protein that\nlocalizes in the basolateral membrane of MR cells and\nexpresses at lower level in SW than FW [74,75], was\ndown-regulated by both HighCa and LowCa challenges.\nThis could indicate lower water permeability perhaps to\nminimize the potential increase in paracellular perme-\nability evidenced in the changes in CLDNs gene\nexpression.\nResponses to low versus high water [Ca2+]\nFrom the statistical analysis of differential expression,\nclustering and GO enrichment analysis, it became evi-\ndent that the most significant changes occurred in the\ntransfer to low [Ca2+] at 2 h. Whether there was an\nequivalent pattern of response to high [Ca2+] water it\nwas not possible to confirm because it was only ana-\nlyzed at 12 h. However, the analysis of this SAGE library\nallowed the comparison of the impacts of low vs. high\nwater [Ca2+] on the gill transcriptome, summarized in\nFigure 4. It turned out that although specific biological\nprocesses may be regulated, the majority of the affected\nprocesses and genes respond to both challenges deviat-\ning from normal conditions of water Ca2+ availability,\nalthough possibly with different time-frames, magni-\ntudes and signal. For example, a large proportion of\ngenes identified as up-regulated by LowCa water at 2 h\nwere down-regulated by HighCa water at 12 h, including\nthose more highly represented in GO terms, related to\nactin cytoskeleton, muscle contraction and citokinesis.\nConclusions\nWe have used SuperSAGE to carry out a comprehensive\nanalysis of the gill transcriptome during the rapid\nresponses to changes in environmental Ca2+, which\nidentified 1,339 differentially expressed transcripts. The\ngenerated transcript expression patterns provide a fra-\nmework of water calcium-responsive genes in the gill\nduring the initial response after transfer to different\n[Ca2+]. This molecular response entails initial perception\nof alterations, activation of signaling networks and effec-\ntors and suggests active remodeling of cytoskeletal pro-\nteins during the initial acclimation process (Figure 4). It\nis also possible that some alterations of gene expression\nmay represent disruption of calcium sensitive pathways\nas a result of the transfer shock which we cannot distin-\nguish at present from those of acclimation. Nevertheless,\nthis data allows the generation of new hypotheses about\nthe mechanisms of acclimation to environmental cal-\ncium changes, which can be tested in specific experi-\nments (including localization studies, expression analysis\nat different time-frames coupled to morphological exam-\ninations of the gills, confirmation at the protein level,\nfunctional characterization, etc.) in order to refine cur-\nrent models of calcium transport in the gill. In addition,\nthis study also provides a valuable diversity of novel\ntranscripts and different transcript types which will be\nof great interest for further exploration.\nIn summary, our results indicate that when T. nigro-\nviridis are transferred to a low calcium environment,\ntheir gills respond rapidly by up regulating genes related\nto Ca2+ signaling\/homeostasis but also actin cytoskele-\nton reorganization, cytokinesis and muscle contraction,\nwhich may be involved in previously described morpho-\nlogical adjustments in the cells where transepithelial\nCa2+ transport occurs, the MR cells, in response to\naltered Ca2+ levels. Genes related to energy production\nand energy homeostasis are also up-regulated, probably\nreflecting the increased energetic needs of the acclima-\ntion response. The responses to high calcium availability\nappear to affect the same biological processes as the low\ncalcium challenge, although with opposite effects.\nMethods\nExperimental procedure for environmental calcium\nexposure\nAll animal maintenance and handling procedures were\ncarried out in compliance with the recommendations of\nthe Association of Animal Behavior [76] and national leg-\nislation. Wild green spotted puffer fish, originally\nimported from Thailand, were purchased from a local pet\nshop and maintained in 200 L closed circuit aquaria in\nbrackish water (prepared from mixing fresh water and\nnatural sea water to 10 ppt salinity) at 26 \u00b1 1\u00b0C, pH 7.5 \u00b1\n0.5 and natural photoperiod. They were fed once a day\nwith frozen mollusks. After >2 months of acclimatization,\nin April 2007, fish were divided in three groups of six\n(body weight 4.4 \u00b1 1.6 g) and transferred to 25 L aquaria\ncontaining artificial brackish water (ABW) with 10 ppt\nsalinity and different Ca2+ concentrations: 2.9 mM (con-\ntrol group), 0.01 mM (as in ion-poor fresh water, LowCa\ngroup) or 10 mM Ca2+ (as in seawater, HighCa group).\nABW (10 ppt) was prepared from deionized water and\nsalts (Sigma-Aldrich, Madrid, Spain) with a composition\nbased on that for artificial seawater: 131.4 mM NaCl; 2.9\nmM KCl; 7.1 mM MgCl2; 7.1 mM MgSO4 and 0.01, 2.9\nor 10 mM CaCl2, for the Control, LowCa or HighCa\nABW, respectively. LowCa ABW was supplemented with\n5.7 mM choline chloride (C5H14NOCl) to maintain\nosmolarity relatively to other ABW types, and pH\nadjusted to 7.5 with 1 mM NaOH in all water types.\nOsmolality, measured with a vapor pressure osmometer\n(Fiske One-Ten Osmometer, Fiske, VT, USA), was 275-\n300 mOsm\/kg; total ammonia (NH3\/NH4\n+) and nitrites\n(NO2\n-) in water, measured using TetraTest kits(Tetra\nWerke, Melle, Germany), were at recommended levels\nand temperature was kept at 26\u00b0C.

The experiment was repeated\ntwice in the same week (total n = 5-6 fish\/group).\nPlasma total calcium concentration (mM) was measured\nusing a colorimetric assay (o-Cresolphtalein, calcium kit,\nSpinreact, Girona, Spain) in duplicates, and differences\nbetween groups were analyzed by two-way ANOVA fol-\nlowed by Tukey\u2019 test at a statistical significance level of\np < 0.05. The statistical software used was SigmaStat\nv.3.00 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, USA).\nRNA extraction, construction of SuperSAGE libraries and\nsequencing\nTotal RNA was extracted from individual frozen gills\nwith TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) and analyzed for\nintegrity and purity by agarose gel electrophoresis and\nspectrophotometry, respectively. Poly(A)+-RNA was pur-\nified from pooled total RNA (50 \u03bcg from each fish) for\neach experimental group (n = 5-6 per group) using the\nOligotex mRNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)\nand analyzed by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis.\nFive SuperSAGE libraries were constructed from 1 \u03bcg of\ngill poly(A)+-RNA each, corresponding to the groups\nsampled at 2 h (LowCa and control) and 12 h (LowCa,\nHighCa and control), following the protocol described\nby Matsumura et al. [23,77], but instead of ditag conca-\ntenation, cloning and sequencing, 200 ng of amplified\nditags from each library (evaluated using a 2100 Bioana-\nlyzer, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, California) were\ndirectly sequenced by massively parallel pyrosequencing\nusing a GS20 sequencer (1\/2 run; 454 Life Sciences,\nBranford, CT, USA) at the Max Planck Institute for\nMolecular Genetics, Berlin.\nSuperSAGE data analysis\nSuperSAGE tags were extracted from sequenced ditags\nusing the \u201cSuperSAGE_tag_extract_pipe\u201d program pipe-\nline, which included stringent quality-control steps for\nremoval of duplicated ditags, ditags containing incom-\nplete library-identifying linkers and ditags with contami-\nnating linker sequences in interior or ambiguous bases\n[24]. Comparison of tag frequencies between libraries\nwas carried out by the \u201cSuperSAGE_tag_freq_comp\u201d\nscript [24]. The SuperSAGE tags (transcripts) were\nFigure 4 Main biological processes affected by transfer to water at different Ca2+ concentrations in Tetraodon gills.

BMC Genomics 2010, 11:476\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/11\/476\nPage 16 of 21\ndeposited in NCBI\u2019s Gene Expression Omnibus [78] and\nare accessible through GEO Series accession number\nGSE19854.\nThe relative frequency of each tag across different\nSuperSAGE libraries was compared by combinations of\nG-tests for multiple library comparison [41,79] and Z-\ntests for pairwise comparisons [79,80] using the G_test\nand SAGEstat software (supplied by the authors) and sig-\nnificance levels (p) set at 0.05. Four different G-tests were\nperformed using different subsets of libraries and deci-\nsion rules [41,79]: 1) G-Test1 = Control vs. LowCa, 2) G-\nTest2 = pooled Control and LowCa at 2 h vs. pooled\nControl and LowCa at 12 h, 3) G-Test3 = Control vs.\nLowCa and Control vs. HighCa at 12 h, and 4) G-Test4 =\nControl vs. pooled LowCa and HighCa at 12 h. As a\nresult, four different classes of differentially expressed\ntags were identified: 1) tags \u201cdifferentially expressed\nbetween control and LowCa water independently of\nexposure time\u201d (global effect) passed all decision rules in\nG-Test1 and the pairwise Z-test control vs. LowCa (p <\n0.05); 2) tags \u201cregulated by LowCa water over time\u201d\n(time-dependent effect) passed Gintrinsic in both G-Test1\nand G-Test2, failed any of the other decision rules in G-\nTest1, and the control vs. LowCa effect at 2 or 12 h was\nconfirmed by passing Z-test and failing any of the homo-\ngeneity rules in G-Test2; 3) tags \u201cdifferentially expressed\nbetween control and HighCa at 12 h\u201d passed all decision\nrules in G-Test3 and the Z-test for this comparison; 4)\n\u201ctags with a global effect of altered water [Ca2+] at 12 h\u201d\npassed all decision rules in G-Test4 and in the Z-test of\ncontrol vs. Low or HighCa at 12 h.\nIn order to avoid losing biological information from\nlow abundance transcripts by the exclusion of tags with\nzero counts before tag relative frequency calculation, the\nG-test software estimated a \u201czero-substitution value\u201d of\n0.345 \u00b1 0.03 (mean \u00b1 standard error) [41,79]. Only tags\nwhose differential expression passed statistical signifi-\ncance in all defined G- and Z-tests and with expression\nratio R (tag counts of water [Ca2+]-altered libraries\/tag\ncounts of control libraries at each time point) \u22652-fold\nwere subjected to further analysis. When tag count was\nzero the \u201czero substitution value\u201d 0.345 was assigned\nbefore calculation of R.\nTag-to-gene annotation\nThe annotation of SAGE tags (assignment to the corre-\nsponding mRNA and protein) is frequently made by\ninterrogating databases of virtual tags extracted from\nunigene entries [26,27,42-44]. However, since no virtual\ntag database or unigene entries are available for\nT. nigroviridis an alternative 2-step annotation proce-\ndure was used. In the first step, SuperSAGE tags were\nmapped to T. nigroviridis genomic\/cDNA sequences\n(available July 2008), running the stand alone Formatdb\nand BlastN scripts (blast-2.2.14-ia32-linux.tar.gz package\navailable at NCBI [81]) against each of three DNA data-\nsets: 1) all T. nigroviridis mRNA GenBank [82] (\u201cNCBI\ncDNAs\u201d dataset; 99,852 GenBank sequences); 2) tran-\nscripts resulting from known, novel and pseudo gene\npredictions from the T. nigroviridis genome [83]\n(\"Ensembl cDNAs\u201d dataset, 23,289 sequences); and 3)\nthe latest assembly of the T. nigroviridis genome [84]\n(\u201dTetraodon genome\u201d dataset, 21 chromosomes). The\n\u201cSuperSAGE_tag_BLAST\u201d suite of programs [24] were\nused to parse BlastN results under stringent conditions\n(only perfect tag-to-DNA matches, with 26\/26 identical\nnucleotides, were accepted) and to extract DNA frag-\nments 1000-bp upstream from tag-genomic matches.\nIn the second step, top BlastN cDNA\/genomic\nmatches for each tag were compared to the Swiss-Prot\nprotein database (downloaded March 2009 [85]) using\nstand-alone BlastX. To assign protein identities to each\ntag, the expect value (E) was set at <10-5 and the hier-\narchical preference order for BlastX matches was: NCBI\ncDNAs > Ensembl cDNAs > Tetraodon genome 1000-\nbp fragments. This process was verified manually in\ncases of multiple BlastX matches using queries from dif-\nferent DNA datasets and for the genes analyzed by\nqPCR. The alignment directions of BlastN (tag to DNA)\nand BlastX (DNA to Swiss-Prot protein) were compared\nto identify tags potentially derived from antisense tran-\nscripts (those presenting an inverted match to a sense\ncDNA or a direct match to an antisense cDNA). Tags\nmatching members from the mammalian claudin family\nof proteins were assigned to their fish claudin isoform\nby stand-alone BlastX against the 56 Takifugu rubripes\nclaudin proteins (GenBank accession numbers\nAAT64039-AAT64094).\nClustering analysis\nThe 1,339 tags identified as differentially expressed were\ngrouped according to their expression patterns among\ndifferent libraries by K-means clustering analysis, using\nthe SAGE data analysis tool and the TransChisq algo-\nrithm [86]. Two clustering analyses were performed: the\n\u201cLowCa analysis\u201d clustered 1,208 tags according to their\npattern of expression among control and LowCa\nlibraries (all differentially expressed tags excluding those\nwith significant effect only for HighCa challenge and\nthose with zero tag count in all the control and LowCa\nlibraries), while the \u201c12 h analysis\u201d clustered 1,098 tags\n(all differentially expressed tags except those with zero\ntag count in all the 12 h libraries) according to their\npattern of expression among 12 h libraries (control,\nLowCa and HighCa). The optimal number of clusters K\nwas obtained by a combination of the TransChisq algo-\nrithm and Gap statistics run in MatLab (MathWorks\nLtd., Cambridge, UK) as described in [86].\nPinto et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:476\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/11\/476\nPage 17 of 21\nGene ontology (GO) annotation and enrichment analysis\nGene ontology mapping was performed on differentially\nexpressed tags by retrieving the GO terms [28] asso-\nciated with all significant BlastX hits (E value < 10-10) of\neach tag-matching DNA against the Swiss-Prot protein\ndatabase. GO enrichment was then determined for each\nlist of annotated differentially expressed tags (all\nLowCa-regulated tags, each of the six LowCa clusters,\nall 12 h-regulated tags or each of the six 12 h clusters)\nusing a one-tailed proportion test [87] at a false discov-\nery rate adjusted p-value of 0.01, between the number\nof tags containing a given GO in each list compared to\nthe number of tags containing that GO in the normal\ngill transcriptome at the corresponding time point (all\ntags contained in control libraries at 2 and 12 h, for the\nLowCa analysis, or at 12 h only for the 12 h analysis).\nQuantitative polymerase chain reaction\nEight differentially expressed genes identified by Super-\nSAGE (ecac, cldn3a, cldn28a, cldn28b, prvb, ileu, at2a1,\nhbb and ckm1) were selected and analyzed by quantita-\ntive real-time PCR (qPCR) in the same individual RNAs\nused for SuperSAGE library construction. Specific pri-\nmers for each gene were designed based on available\ngenomic or cDNA sequences and on the alignment with\nrelated genes to avoid cross-amplification, using Beacon\nDesign software (Premier Biosoft Int., Palo Alto, CA).\nPrimer sequences, amplicon sizes and optimized tem-\nperatures used in qPCR for each pair are shown in\nAdditional file 8. For cDNA synthesis, 4 \u03bcg total RNA\nwas treated with DNA-free Kit (Ambion, UK) and\ncDNA synthesis was carried out using 500 ng of\nDNAse-treated total RNA, 200 ng of random hexamers\n(GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), 40U of MMLV\nreverse transcriptase (RT) (Promega, Southampton, UK)\nand 5U of RNAguard RNase inhibitor (GE Healthcare)\nin a total volume of 20 \u03bcl. Quantification was performed\nin duplicate reactions using SYBRgreen chemistry\n(Power SYBR\u00ae Green PCR Master Mix, Applied Biosys-\ntems, UK) and the relative standard curve method [88],\nusing a Bio-Rad iClycler iQ5 qPCR thermocycler and\nsoftware (Bio-Rad Laboratories). PCR cycling conditions\nwere 10 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 55 cycles of 10 sec at\n95\u00b0C, 20 sec at 60\u00b0C and 30 seconds at 72\u00b0C. A final\nmelting curve was carried out between 60 and 98\u00b0C for\nall genes and showed single product\/dissociation curves.\nAll amplicons were sequenced to confirm specificity.\nStandard curves relating initial template quantity to\namplification cycle were generated using serial dilutions\nof linearized plasmid DNA containing the gene of inter-\nest, and efficiency ranged between 75-100% with R2 >\n0.99. No cross-amplification was detected between\nclosely related genes (cldn28a and cldn28b) by testing\nthe PCR over the heterologous template. Absence of\nDNA contamination was confirmed by testing the\namplification of all genes on a sample that did not\nreceive reverse transcriptase. The expression of three\ncandidate reference genes (18s, g3p and rps18) was\nquantified in the same conditions and no statistically\nsignificant differences were found between experimental\ngroups for any of them. rps18 was chosen as endogen-\nous reference gene to normalize qPCR data as it had the\nlowest variation and a level of expression of the same\norder of magnitude to target genes. Statistical signifi-\ncance of relative gene expression between groups was\nanalyzed by two-way ANOVA. Pearson correlations\nbetween the qPCR data (average expression for each\nexperimental group) and the cumulative signal obtained\nby SuperSAGE (sum of tag counts annotated to the\nsame gene) were calculated for each gene after log2\ntransformation of both variables. A Pearson correlation\nwas also calculated between qPCR and SuperSAGE log2\ntransformed gene expression fold changes between trea-\nted groups and control at each time point. The signifi-\ncance level was 5%.\nAdditional material\nAdditional file 1: Venn diagram summarizing the mapping of\ndifferentially expressed tag sequences to the three available\ndatasets containing T. nigroviridis DNA sequences.\nAdditional file 2: Percentage of tag mapping to different T.\nnigroviridis DNA datasets using different levels of stringency.\nAdditional file 3: Main data file summarizing all the expression (tag\ncounts, expression ratios and clustering) and annotation data\n(BlastN and BlastX results) for the 1,339 differentially expressed\ntags identified.
