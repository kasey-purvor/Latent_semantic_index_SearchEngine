Introduction\nExtremely Low Frequency\/Very Low Frequency (ELF\/ VLF) chorus emissions are elec-25\ntromagnetic waves which are spontaneously generated in the Earth's magnetosphere. Cho-26\nrus is characterized as consisting of repeating, usually rising and often overlapping coher-27\nent tones and is invariably accompanied by a band of hiss [e.g. Cornilleau-Wehrlin et al.,28\n1978]. In recent years, chorus has received increased attention due to the role that it is29\nthought to play in the acceleration [e.g.Meredith et al., 2002; Horne et al., 2003, 2005] and30\nloss [e.g. Lorentzen et al., 2001; O'Brien et al., 2003; Thorne et al., 2005; Shprits et al.,31\n2006] of energetic electrons in the Earth's radiation belts. Additionally, some fraction32\nof chorus may act via its evolution into plasmaspheric hiss [Parrot et al., 2004; Santol\u0013\u0010k33\net al., 2006; Bortnik et al., 2008] as an additional loss agent for energetic electrons [e.g.,34\nLyons et al., 1972; Lyons and Thorne, 1973; Abel and Thorne, 1998;Meredith et al., 2007].35\nChorus waves are believed to be generated by a Doppler-shifted cyclotron interaction36\nbetween anisotropic distributions of energetic > 40 keV electrons and ambient background37\nVLF noise [Tsurutani and Smith, 1974, 1977; Thorne et al., 1977]. These unstable distri-38\nbutions can result from substorm injection, and correspondingly, chorus is predominantly39\nobserved across the morning and noon local time sectors in association with eastward40\ndrifting electrons. Because magnetic substorms both increase the \rux of hot source elec-41\ntrons which generate chorus as well as enhance the auroral electrojet, increases in the42\nAE index have been shown to be a good predictor of chorus occurrence within the inner43\nmagnetosphere [Smith et al., 1999; Meredith et al., 2001]. The outer dayside region of the44\nmagnetosphere is also conducive to chorus generation, but here waves are less dependent45\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nX - 4 GOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS\non substorm activity and can be observed under both quiet and disturbed geomagnetic46\nconditions [Tsurutani and Smith, 1977; Li et al., 2009; Spasojevic and Inan, 2010].47\nGround-based measurements of ELF\/VLF emissions are by de\fnition limited to the48\nsmall subset of space-based emissions that are able to penetrate to low altitudes and49\nthrough the ionosphere [e.g. Sonwalkar , 1995, pp 424-425]. Ground-based observations50\nmay include (1) waves that have propagated such that their wave normals naturally arrive51\nwithin the transmission cone at the ionospheric boundary [Helliwell , 1965, section 3.7], (2)52\nwaves that have propagated within \feld-aligned density irregularities known as \\ducts\"53\n[e.g., Smith, 1961; Carpenter , 1966; Carpenter and Sulic, 1988], which have the e\u000bect of54\nconstraining the wave normals to be nearly \feld-aligned, or (3) waves that arrive at the55\nionospheric boundary with non-vertical wave normals and are then scattered from low-56\naltitude meter-scale density irregularities [Sonwalkar and Harikumar , 2000] that rotate57\nthe wave normals into the transmission cone.58\nIn situ measurements of chorus have shown that chorus occurs in two bands, separated59\nby half the equatorial gyrofrequency (fceq) along the observation \feld line [Tsurutani and60\nSmith, 1974; Burtis and Helliwell , 1976; Tsurutani and Smith, 1977]. Of the two bands,61\nonly the lower band is thought to reach the ground; the upper band is believed to re\rect62\nat high altitudes due to its highly oblique wave normal angle [Hayakawa et al., 1984;63\nHaque et al., 2010]. Thus, chorus received on the ground is expected to be exclusively64\nlower band chorus, generated below half the equatorial gyrofrequency.65\nThe current work is motivated by a recent statistical study by Golden et al. [2009] of66\nchorus and hiss observed on the ground at Palmer Station, Antarctica, at L = 2:4, 50\u000eS67\ngeomagnetic latitude. During the course of that study, which spanned 10 months in 2003,68\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nGOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS X - 5\nchorus was observed on more than 50% of days. This was unexpected for several reasons.69\nFirst, chorus is generated outside the plasmasphere, according to early satellite studies70\n[e.g. Gurnett and O'Brien, 1964; Dunckel and Helliwell , 1969] which have shown that71\nchorus is most commonly observed outside the plasmasphere. In addition, chorus observed72\non the ground has traditionally been interpreted as a ducted emission, and therefore, that73\nthe L-shell on which it is received is approximately the same as the L-shell on which it is74\ngenerated. The presumption that non-ducted chorus cannot penetrate to the ground [e.g.75\nImhof et al., 1989, p. 10,092] is based on raytracing results that show that nonducted76\nwhistlers will magnetospherically-re\rect before returning to the ground [Kimura, 1966;77\nEdgar , 1976] and is supported by occasional observation of chorus-like noise bursts that,78\nin ground observations, appear to have been triggered [Carpenter et al., 1975] or damped79\n[Gail and Carpenter , 1984] by ducted whistlers (implying that the observed whistlers80\nand chorus share the same duct). However, in the study of Golden et al. [2009], the81\nmagnetospheric conditions were such that the plasmapause was often expected to be82\nwell beyond Palmer's L-shell during chorus observations. During that study, chorus was83\nobserved for Kp . 2+. According to the plasmapause model of Carpenter and Anderson84\n[1992], at Kp = 2+, the plasmapause is expected to be around L \u0018 4:5. It is only for85\nKp > 6+ that the plasmapause is expected to reach down to L < 2:5. Also, the frequency86\nrange of observed chorus suggests that the source region of the waves is well beyond87\nPalmer's L-shell. Satellite studies have shown that lower-band chorus is generated for88\nfrequencies in the range 0:1fceq \u0014 f \u0014 0:5fceq [Tsurutani and Smith, 1974; Burtis and89\nHelliwell , 1976]. Waves of frequencies below 500 Hz were observed by Golden et al.90\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nX - 6 GOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS\n[2009], which corresponds to a source location of L > 5:5 under a dipole model of the91\nEarth's magnetic \feld.92\nIt seems clear that the observations of Golden et al. [2009] are inconsistent with the93\ntheory of ducted propagation of chorus and that the dominant mode of chorus reception at94\nmid-latitude stations like Palmer may instead be non-ducted. In support of this possibility,95\nChum and Santol\u0013\u0010k [2005] have shown via raytracing that non-ducted chorus, generated96\nin the equatorial magnetosphere with wave normal angles near the local Gendrin angle,97\nmay be able to reach the ionosphere and penetrate to the ground at L-shells signi\fcantly98\nbelow those at which the waves are generated. Although Chum and Santol\u0013\u0010k [2005] did99\nnot include a plasmasphere in their analysis, it seems logical, given the exo-plasmaspheric100\nsource of chorus and the location of Palmer within the plasmasphere, that the location of101\nthe plasmapause may play an important role in determining which subsets of chorus may102\nbe able to be received at Palmer.103\nIn this study, we address two broad questions. (1) What is the location of the plasma-104\npause when chorus is observed at Palmer? (2) How does the location of the plasmapause105\na\u000bect the portion of the chorus source region that is able to propagate to the ground106\nand be received at Palmer? These questions are answered via a combination of (i) a107\nthree-month statistical study of chorus observations using the Stanford ELF\/VLF wave108\nreceiver at Palmer Station coupled with simultaneous measurements of the plasmapause109\nusing the Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) instrument on board the IMAGE satellite, and (ii)110\na model-based study of chorus propagation e\u000bects via a new Stanford VLF 3D raytracing111\nsoftware package, used to model magnetospheric propagation and Landau damping under112\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nGOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS X - 7\ndi\u000berent models of the plasmapause location, as well as a full wave code, used to model113\nelectromagnetic propagation in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide.114\n2. Experimental Methodology\nIn order to determine the location of the plasmapause when chorus is observed at Palmer115\nStation, we employ two separate databases: a database of emissions observed at Palmer116\nStation and a database of plasmapause locations at Palmer's MLT. Both databases span117\nthree months, from April through June 2001, and are discussed below.118\n2.1. Palmer Emission Database\nPalmer Station is located on Anvers Island, near the tip of the Antarctic peninsula, at119\n64.77\u000e S, 64.05\u000e W, with IGRF geomagnetic parameters of L = 2:4, 50\u000eS geomagnetic lat-120\nitude, and magnetic local time (MLT) = UTC\u0000 4:0 at 100 km altitude. The Palmer VLF121\nreceiver records broadband VLF data at 100 kilosamples per second using two cross-loop122\nmagnetic \feld antennas, with 96 dB of dynamic range. This analysis uses the North\/South123\nchannel exclusively, it being the less subjectively noisy of the two channels; this has the124\nadditional e\u000bect of focusing Palmer's viewing area more tightly to its magnetic meridian125\nthan if both channels were used. Data products used in this study are 10-second broad-126\nband data \fles, subsampled at a rate of 20 kilosamples per second, beginning every 15127\nminutes at 5, 20, 35 and 50 minutes past the hour, 24 hours per day.128\nThe year 2001 falls approximately on the peak of Solar Cycle 23, and chorus occur-129\nrence is frequent at Palmer Station during this period. A combination of automated130\nemission detection [Golden and Spasojevic, 2010] and manual correction is used to deter-131\nmine the presence of emissions. The automated detector rejects confounding impulsive132\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nX - 8 GOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS\nelectromagnetic signals, such as sferics and whistlers, and focuses on chorus and hiss.133\nChorus is then distinguished from hiss based on its \\burstiness,\" namely, the frequency134\ncontent of the amplitude modulation of the broadband signal. Bursty signals are classi-135\n\fed as chorus, and non-bursty signals are classi\fed as hiss, and discarded. The output136\nof the automated detector is then manually veri\fed to eliminate false positives (e.g., hiss137\nor lightning-generated whistlers erroneously labeled as chorus) and false negatives (e.g.,138\nweak chorus emissions that may have been rejected based on their proximity to sferics139\nor other emissions). Although it is likely that some chorus emissions with low signal-to-140\nnoise ratios are erroneously rejected by this algorithm, the profusion of detected chorus141\nemissions still leads to statistically-signi\fcant results.142\nWe de\fne a \\synoptic epoch\" as an interval during which Palmer data is sampled for143\nthis study. Each universal hour contains four synoptic epochs, at 5, 20, 35 and 50 minutes144\npast the hour. At each synoptic epoch, a binary judgment is made about whether cho-145\nrus is observed or not, based on the results of both the automated detector and manual146\ninspection. The resulting table of true\/false values for chorus observation vs. time then147\nbecomes the database of Palmer chorus emissions. As an overview, Figure 1 shows a148\ncumulative spectrogram of the chorus emissions used in this study. The cumulative spec-149\ntrogram is e\u000bectively the logarithmic sum of the spectrums of its constituent emissions,150\nand is a measure of the average chorus spectrum with respect to frequency and local time.151\nThe full procedure is described in Golden et al. [2009, Section 2.2]. The gap at \u0018 1:7 kHz152\non the cumulative spectrogram is a result of increased attenuation below the \frst trans-153\nverse electric (TE1) waveguide mode cuto\u000b during propagation in the Earth-ionosphere154\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nGOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS X - 9\nwaveguide. Only emissions in the boxed region, in the range 4 \u0014 MLT \u0014 10 are used in155\nthis study.156\n2.2. Plasmapause Location Database\nIn order to determine the instantaneous plasmapause location at each synoptic epoch,157\ndata from the Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) instrument [Sandel et al., 2000] on board the158\nIMAGE satellite [Burch, 2000] are used. The EUV instrument images resonantly scattered159\nsunlight from He+ ions, which are a minority constituent of the plasma in the Earth's160\nplasmasphere. The He+ edge, as seen by the EUV instrument, has been shown to be an161\naccurate proxy for the plasmapause [Goldstein et al., 2003], which is the region of the162\nmagnetosphere where the electron density exhibits a steep drop with increasing L value.163\nBecause this study focuses on emissions observed on the ground at Palmer, the extent of164\nthe plasmapause is only considered at Palmer's magnetic local time, MLT = UTC\u0000 4:0.165\nRaw EUV images are initially mapped to the equatorial plane using the minimum L166\ntechnique of Roelof and Skinner [2000, Section 2.2], assuming a dipole model for the167\nEarth's magnetic \feld. The radial extent of the plasmapause is then manually selected on168\neach individual EUV image at MLT = UTC\u0000 4:0 and that plasmapause value is added169\nto the database. EUV images where the plasmapause cannot be found due to excessive170\nnoise or EUV camera malfunction, or where the plasmapause is either poorly de\fned or171\nnot visible below L = 6, are discarded. After removing data gaps from both databases,172\n1033 synoptic epochs, or approximately 260 hours of data, remain for this study.173\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nX - 10 GOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS\n3. Dependence of Chorus Observations on Plasmapause Extent\n3.1. Choice of AE Metric\nSince this study concerns the role of the plasmapause in dictating the observation of174\nchorus emissions, it is instructive to make mention of how the plasmapause is correlated175\nwith the AE index, which is itself well correlated with the observation of chorus emissions176\n[e.g. Meredith et al., 2001]. This is done to explore a potential confounding e\u000bect where a177\nsingle event, namely a magnetic substorm, may have two simultaneous consequences: (1)178\nenhancement of the auroral electrojet, causing an increase in AE and (2) erosion of the179\nplasmasphere.180\nFigure 2 shows the extent of the plasmapause, sampled at 04 \u0014 MLT \u0014 10,181\nMLT = UTC\u0000 4:0, plotted against the instantaneous AE index (left), and the average182\nAE in the previous 12 hours (right), over the three-month period of this study. Averaging183\nthe AE index over N = 12 hours yields approximately the greatest correlation for any184\nvalue of N . The plasmapause is moderately correlated with the log of instantaneous AE,185\nwith correlation coe\u000ecient \u001a = \u00000:43 and residual standard deviation \u001berr = 0:75 L, and186\nhighly correlated with the log of the average AE in the previous 12 hours, with correlation187\ncoe\u000ecient \u001a = \u00000:81 and residual standard deviation \u001berr = 0:49 L.188\nHowever, the manner in which AE is associated with plasmapause extent di\u000bers from189\nhow it is expected to be associated with chorus occurrence. The time between when AE190\nis enhanced and when chorus is expected to be seen at Palmer may be determined by191\ncalculating the expected time required for a chorus source particle to drift from 00 MLT192\nto 06 MLT. Based on Walt [1994, Figure B.2], 100 keV electrons at L = 4 will drift from193\nmidnight to 06 MLT in \u0018 21 min; higher-energy particles will drift more quickly. This194\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nGOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS X - 11\ntime period is on the order of the synoptic epoch used in this study (15 min). Therefore195\ninstantaneous AE is used as the metric for predicting chorus in this study. It is signi\fcant196\nthat, while instantaneous AE is expected to be a good predictor of chorus occurrence,197\nit is only weakly correlated with plasmapause extent. This suggests that source e\u000bects,198\nas measured by instantaneous AE, and propagation e\u000bects, as measured by plasmapause199\nextent, may exert independent control over the probability that chorus will be seen at200\nPalmer at any given time.201\n3.2. Chorus Occurrence vs. Plasmapause Extent\nIn this section, the dependence of chorus normalized occurrence on plasmapause extent202\nis examined. The additional complication of AE is deferred to the multivariate analysis203\nof the next section. Although the detailed structure of the plasmapause boundary layer is204\ncomplex [Carpenter and Lemaire, 2004], the major plasmapause structure is assumed to205\nbe \feld-aligned over much of its range. For the purposes of this study, the plasmapause206\ncan therefore be described via the scalar quantity LPP, which represents the equatorial207\nplasmapause extent, in units of Earth radii. A scatter plot of chorus observations at each208\nsynoptic epoch versus instantaneous AE and LPP is shown in Figure 3. Synoptic epochs209\nwith chorus are indicated with blue squares and epochs without chorus are indicated with210\nred dots. The scattered points themselves are the same as in the left panel of Figure 2,211\nwith some data gaps removed. One can get the general impression from this plot that212\nchorus is more likely to be observed at Palmer for low LPP and high AE. To examine213\nthe data more rigorously, regression analysis is used to construct a generalized linear214\nmodel [e.g. Chatterjee and Hadi , 2006] of chorus normalized occurrence as a function of215\nplasmapause extent. This provides additional insight into properties that are not obvious216\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nX - 12 GOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS\nfrom a simple scatter plot, such as at which LPP chorus occurrence is maximized, and217\nhow strong that peak is.218\nUnder regression analysis, a linear combination of parameters is sought to form an219\nestimate of \u0016, the probability of chorus occurrence. Because linear models have, in general,220\nunbounded values, a logit response function is used for \u0016, de\fning the output of the linear221\nmodel, Y as222\nY = log\n\u0012\n\u0016\n1\u0000 \u0016\n\u0013\n; (1)\nand conversely,223\n\u0016 =\neY\n1 + eY\n(2)\nThis transforms the bounded parameter \u0016 2 [0; 1] to the unbounded parameter224\nY 2 (\u00001;1). Given p distinct independent variables, Y is modeled as225\nY = X\f =\n\u0002\n1; x1; x2; : : : ; xp\n\u0003\n266664\n\f0\n\f1\n\f2\n...\n\fp\n377775 ; (3)\nwhere X is a row vector of predictors, formed by transformations of the independent vari-226\nables (e.g., x1 = LPP, x2 = LPP\n2, etc.), and \f is a column vector of coe\u000ecient estimates.227\nThe generalized linear model regression procedure from the Matlab software package228\nis used to obtain a linear \ft. Although it is possible to include an arbitrary number229\nof powers of LPP in the model, we honor the principle of parsimony, and favor simpler230\nmodels. Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) [Chatterjee and Hadi , 2006, Section 12.6]231\nis employed for this purpose, which assigns any particular model a lower score for better232\ngoodness of \ft, and a higher score for each included term; lower scores are favored.233\nAdditionally, the maximum model order is restricted to four.234\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nGOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS X - 13\nTo determine whether there is any frequency dependence in the degree to which chorus235\noccurrence changes with LPP, the regression analysis is separately performed on three236\ncases: all frequencies, f < 1:5 kHz and f > 3 kHz. For all frequencies and f < 1:5 kHz,237\nthe fourth-order model has the lowest BIC and is therefore the favored model. For238\nf > 3 kHz, the second-order model has the lowest BIC. The model parameters for the239\nthree cases, along with the p-values, are shown in Table 1. The p-value in this case repre-240\nsents the probability of erroneously assigning a nonzero value to a given coe\u000ecient when241\nits true value is zero. Since all of the p-values are well below 0.05, we can safely assume242\nthat all coe\u000ecients are signi\fcant.243\nFigure 4 shows the modeled normalized occurrence as a function of plasmapause extent244\nfor the three cases of all frequencies (left), f < 1:5 kHz (center) and f > 3 kHz (right). \u0016245\nis indicated by a solid black line, and the 95% con\fdence intervals of the \ft are indicated246\nby the surrounding shaded regions. The model for f < 1:5 kHz is quite similar to the247\none for all frequencies, with the same predictors X and similar coe\u000ecients \f. The model248\nfor f > 3 kHz is rather di\u000berent, with di\u000berent X. This is a consequence of the fact that249\n80% of chorus observed at Palmer includes frequency components below 1.5 kHz, but only250\n33% of chorus includes components above 3 kHz.251\nA distinct feature of all curves is a \\saturation\" e\u000bect, where chorus occurrence does not252\nincrease monotonically with decreasing plasmapause extent; instead, a peak in occurrence253\ncan be seen at LPP = 2:6 for f < 1:5 kHz and at LPP = 2:7 for f > 3 kHz. Additionally, the254\ncurve for f < 1:5 kHz has a longer tail for higher LPP than that of f > 3 kHz, indicating255\nthat a less-disturbed (more-extended) plasmasphere permits only lower frequency chorus256\naccess to Palmer.257\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nX - 14 GOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS\n3.3. Chorus Occurrence vs. Plasmapause Extent and AE\nAlthough it was shown in the previous section that plasmapause extent is strongly258\nrelated to chorus normalized occurrence at Palmer, it is not yet clear whether this is truly a259\nconsequence of the instantaneous plasmapause extent or whether it is simply a consequence260\nof the fact that magnetic substorms both increase the likelihood of chorus and, separately,261\ncause erosion of the plasmapause. To explore this confounding e\u000bect, multiple regression262\nis used to separately examine dependence of \u0016 on both plasmapause extent, which may263\na\u000bect chorus propagation, and AE, which is related to chorus generation.264\nAgain, a solution to (3) is sought, except that now X includes LPP and log10AE terms265\nas well as interaction terms. Beginning with a model that includes all permutations of266\nLPP through LPP\n4 and log10AE through (log10AE)\n4 of total order four or less, terms with267\nhigh p-values whose removal increases BIC are dropped. Eventually, the model of Table 2268\nis found. Table 2 shows the selected model parameters, their coe\u000ecients, and the p-value269\nof each coe\u000ecient.270\nA plot of \u0016, the modeled parameter of (2), as a function of LPP and log10AE for all271\nfrequencies, is shown in Figure 5a. To reduce noise in panel (a), the actual plotted quantity272\nis \u0016 \u0001 (1\u0000 \u001b295) instead of \u0016, where \u001b95 is the range of the 95% con\fdence interval, obtained273\nby subtracting panel (c) from panel (b). This has the e\u000bect of setting areas with high274\nvariance to zero, e.g., the lower-left and upper-right portions of the plot. As in Section 3.2,275\na saturation e\u000bect is seen with respect to LPP, and a peak in \u0016 is seen at LPP = 2:6 for276\nAE & 100 nT. Additionally, the long tail in LPP is reproduced, with \u0016 retaining a small277\nbut nonzero value up to LPP \u0018 4:5.278\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nGOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS X - 15\nThe primary takeaway fact from Figure 5 is that features with respect to LPP persist for279\na wide range of AE, and features with respect to AE persist for a wide range of LPP. E.g.,280\nthe peak at LPP = 2:6 exists for 200 nT . AE . 1000 nT, and the peak at AE = 500 nT281\nexists for 2:1 . LPP . 3:1. This is an indication that e\u000bects of AE or LPP near the peak282\nof chorus occurrence are quasi-independent of each other. Had it been otherwise, and the283\ne\u000bects of AE and LPP were strongly dependent, the peak in Figure 5 would appear as a284\ndiagonal line. Therefore, it is clear that the plasmapause is in fact signi\fcantly changing285\nthe characteristics of chorus propagation to Palmer, and that the correlation between LPP286\nand \u0016 is not merely a confounding e\u000bect of the fact that magnetic substorms tend to a\u000bect287\nboth chorus generation and the plasmapause.288\n4. Modeling of Chorus Propagation\nThe e\u000bects of plasmapause extent on chorus propagation are further investigated using289\na combination of raytracing and full wave modeling. First, reverse raytracing is used290\nwherein rays begin above the ionosphere over Palmer with wave normal angles within the291\nionospheric transmission cone. The rays are then propagated backwards to their magne-292\ntospheric source. A valid source location for each ray is outside the plasmasphere at the293\nmagnetic equatorial plane [LeDocq et al., 1998; Santol\u0013\u0010k et al., 2005] at a radial distance294\nsuch that the wave frequency is in the range 0:1fceq \u0014 f \u0014 0:5fceq [Tsurutani and Smith,295\n1974; Burtis and Helliwell , 1976]. Rays that are able to enter a valid source location296\nare binned by radial extent and wave normal angle. This creates a comprehensive pic-297\nture of the portion of the equatorial source region from which generated rays may reach298\nPalmer. Ray attenuation is calculated via Landau damping on the magnetospheric ray299\npaths using an empirical model of energetic particle \ruxes. In addition, we assume that300\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nX - 16 GOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS\nwaves may penetrate the ionosphere some distance from Palmer and propagate within the301\nEarth-ionosphere waveguide before being received; a full wave model is used to estimate302\nthis additional waveguide attenuation. Full details of the simulation are further discussed303\nbelow. The simulation is performed for a range of plasmapause extents. For each plasma-304\npause extent, a single scalar quantity is calculated, which we term the Chorus Availability305\nFactor (CHAF). CHAF is a cumulative measure of the portion of the chorus source region,306\nintegrated over all radial extents and wave normals, and weighted by relative attenuation307\nand source probability, that is observable at Palmer. Although CHAF is not a probability,308\nif the plasmapause extent does signi\fcantly in\ruence chorus propagation, the trends of309\nCHAF versus LPP are expected to resemble those of the experimentally modeled chorus310\nnormalized occurrence, \u0016, from Section 3.2.311\n4.1. The Stanford VLF 3D Raytracer\nThe new version of the Stanford VLF raytracer was developed by one of us (F. R. F.) as312\na more accurate and complete model to replace Stanford's previous raytracing program313\n[Inan and Bell , 1977], which we refer to as the Stanford VLF legacy raytracer. The new314\nraytracer, which we refer to as the Stanford VLF 3D raytracer, was written from the315\nground up, and is not an extension or revision of the Stanford VLF legacy raytracer. A316\ndescription of the raytracer follows.317\nHamilton's equations for the propagation of a ray through a medium with spatially-318\nvarying dispersion relation de\fned by the implicit function F (!;k; r) = 0 can be stated319\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nGOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS X - 17\nas:320\ndr\ndt\n= \u0000 rkF\n@F=@!\n(4)\ndk\ndt\n=\nrrF\n@F=@!\n(5)\nWith the constraint:321\nF (!;k; r) = 0 (6)\nFor generality, and for the purpose of accommodating any arbitrary function for the322\nplasma density or background magnetic \feld, the spatial and k-space derivatives are323\nevaluated numerically using \fnite di\u000berences, that is:324\n@F\n@ki\n\u0019 1\n2\u0001k\n(F (!;k+\u0001kei; r)\u0000 F (!;k\u0000\u0001kei; r)) (7)\n@F\n@ri\n\u0019 1\n2\u0001r\n(F (!;k; r+\u0001rei)\u0000 F (!;k; r\u0000\u0001rei)) ; (8)\nwhere i = f1; 2; 3g, and ei are the unit vectors. Since the derivatives are evaluated nu-325\nmerically, all that is required to adapt a new plasma density model is a function that326\nevaluates F (!;k; r).327\nAfter approximating the spatial and k-space derivatives, six ordinary di\u000berential328\nequations remain, which are integrated numerically in time using a standard adaptive329\nRunge-Kutta method. In contrast to the approach of Haselgrove [1955], a moving B0-330\naligned coordinate system is not used; instead, the system of equations is directly solved in331\nglobal Cartesian coordinates. After one time step, the constraint F = 0 is not in general332\nmet, and an intermediate solution exists with an error F (!;k\u0003; r\u0003) = \u000f. This is handled333\nusing a standard method for solving constrained ODEs, by \fnding a \\nearby\" point (k; r)334\nthat satis\fes F (!;k; r) = 0 after every time step. The speci\fc approach used is to sim-335\nply re-solve the dispersion relation assuming the wave normal angle is kept constant. If336\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nX - 18 GOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS\nthis fails (due to being too close to the resonance cone), the time step is halved and the337\nprocedure is attempted again.338\nThe Stanford VLF 3D raytracer can accommodate any arbitrary function for the339\ncold background plasma number density. In this study, the Global Core Plasma Model340\n(GCPM) [Gallagher et al., 2000] is implemented, sampled on a regular grid and interpo-341\nlated by a fast, local, C1 (continuous in the \frst derivative) tricubic interpolation scheme342\ndescribed in Lekien and Marsden [2005]. The plasmasphere modeled by the GCPM is \feld-343\naligned to the dipole \feld, and remains so from the equatorial region down to altitudes344\nbetween 7800 km (Kp \u0018 3+) to 2600 km (Kp \u0018 8\u0000). The typical plasmapause represented345\nby the GCPM exhibits a density drop of between 1 (Kp \u0018 3+) and 1.5 (Kp \u0018 8\u0000) orders346\nof magnitude in the equatorial plane over a range of about 0.3 RE. The choice of back-347\nground magnetic \feld is also arbitrary; in this study, the Tsyganenko-96 (T96) model348\n[Tsyganenko, 1995; Tsyganenko and Stern, 1996] is used.349\nThermal losses are included as in Kennel [1966]. Equation (3.9) in Kennel [1966],350\ncorrected for a typographical error [Chen et al., 2009, paragraph 9], is solved for the351\nLandau (m = 0) resonance. This yields the temporal damping rate !i, which is then352\nrelated to the spatial damping rate ki by the relation in Brinca [1972]:353\n!i =\n\u0000!\nki \u0001 \u0000!vg : (9)\nThe method in Kennel [1966] requires the evaluation of the gradients of the hot particle354\ndistribution function in (vk; v?) space, as well as the evaluation of a 1D integral over v?355\nover the interval [0;1). In order to accommodate any arbitrary distribution function, the356\nderivatives are again evaluated numerically using \fnite di\u000berences. The velocity is \frst357\nnormalized by the speed of light for numerical reasons, then mapped into a \fnite range358\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nGOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS X - 19\nt = (0; 1) using the mapping v? = (1\u0000 t)=t:359 Z 1\n0\nf(v?)dv? =\nZ 1\n0\n1\nt2\nf\n\u0012\n1\u0000 t\nt\n\u0013\ndt: (10)\nFinally, the integral is evaluated numerically using adaptive quadrature. The method360\nused is general and can accommodate any number of resonances. In this study, only the361\nLandau (m = 0) resonance is used, since it is the dominant source of loss.362\nThe choice of hot particle distribution is crucial to the accurate calculation of Lan-363\ndau damping. Within the plasmasphere, the phase space density expression of Bell364\net al. [2002], based on measurements with the POLAR spacecraft sampled in the range365\n2:3 < L < 4, is used. Outside the plasmasphere, the methodology of Bortnik et al. [2007a],366\nderived from measurements with the CRRES spacecraft outside the plasmasphere up to367\nL \u0018 7, is used.368\nA hybrid model smooths the two models at the plasmasphere boundary, and is imple-369\nmented as follows. Let fPOL0 represent the phase space density (PSD) of Bell et al. [2002]370\nfrom POLAR in units of, e.g., s3=cm6, and let fCRR0 represent the PSD of Bortnik et al.371\n[2007a] from CRRES in the same units.

The maximum azimuthal383\ndeviation of any ray considered in this study is 18\u000e (1:2 hours in MLT), with an average384\nmaximal deviation per ray of 7\u000e (0:5 hours in MLT). Because this value is small, the local385\ntime deviation of rays is neglected in this study, and wave normals and positions are given386\nin two dimensions with respect to the meridional plane of the rays.387\n4.2. Raytracing Procedure\nRays are launched in the vicinity of Palmer, at \u0015 = 50\u000eS, MLT = 06, UT = 10. The388\nGCPM and Tsyganenko models for plasma density and magnetic \feld are used, and the389\nrays propagate in the non-ducted mode. Rays are launched at 1000 km altitude, with390\n80 equally-spaced magnetic latitudes within 1000 km of 50\u000eS, and with 13 equally-spaced391\nk-vector angles directed away from the Earth within the transmission cone, for a total of392\n1040 rays per simulation.393\nThe transmission cone angle de\fnes the maximum deviation of downward-directed394\nk-vectors, with respect to the normal to the Earth's surface, that may penetrate through395\nthe ionosphere and to the ground without su\u000bering total internal re\rection at the boundary396\nbetween the lower edge of the ionosphere and free space [e.g. Helliwell , 1965, Section 3.7].397\nTo calculate the transmission cone, it is assumed that the plasma density from the ray398\norigin to the ground may be approximated as a strati\fed medium, and therefore that the399\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nGOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS X - 21\nhorizontal component of the k-vector is conserved.

In practice, under these criteria, no rays survive beyond 10 sec-406\nonds. Each time a ray crosses the equatorial plane, the local plasma density and gyrofre-407\nquency are examined. If the ray is (1) outside the plasmasphere, and (2) within the range408\n0:1fceq \u0014 f \u0014 0:5fceq (where fceq is the equatorial electron gyrofrequency along the given409\n\feld line), which is the frequency range of lower-band chorus [Tsurutani and Smith, 1974;410\nBurtis and Helliwell , 1976], then that point is saved as a potential chorus source location.411\nA single original ray may give rise to more than one potential chorus source location if it412\nexhibits multiple magnetospheric re\rections.413\nThe chorus source region (i.e., the region from which chorus is truly generated, which is414\nnot the same as the location from which the \\reverse\" rays are launched) is considered to lie415\non the equatorial plane, with initial wave normal angles uniformly distributed within the416\nresonance cone. Although several satellite studies have attempted to characterize the wave417\nnormal distribution of the equatorial chorus source [e.g. Haque et al., 2010, and references418\ntherein], statistics have generally been too low to draw any de\fnitive conclusions, leading419\nto our use of a uniform distribution in this study. The source region is binned on two420\nparameters: R, the distance from the center of the Earth in the equatorial plane, and  ,421\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nX - 22 GOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS\nthe initial wave normal angle with respect to the ambient magnetic \feld. Each bin is of422\nuniform size, with \u0001R = 0:05RE and \u0001 = 4\n\u000e.423\nChorus rays that can reach Palmer tend to occur in several distinct \\families,\" or group-424\nings of rays with similar initial wave normals and radial extent. Figure 6 shows several425\nfacets of the raytracing procedure, along with example rays from the two ray families426\nthat are present at 1 kHz. For this simulation, LPP = 2:9. The raytracing procedure is427\ndescribed below with reference to Figure 6.428\nPanel (a) shows representative rays from the two ray families. We interpret the rays in429\ntheir \\forward\" sense, as if they were originally launched from the equatorial plane and430\neventually arrived at 1000 km altitude. Ray paths are shown in white, with wave normals431\nshown as red ticks, equally spaced every 100 ms. The magenta line indicates a contour432\nof f=fceq = 0:1; all chorus generation happens at values of R beyond this boundary. The433\nupper bound on fceq for chorus generation, at f=fceq = 0:5 is beyond the scale of the434\nimage, at R \u0018 7 RE. Palmer's location is indicated by the green triangle at \u0015 = \u000050\u000e on435\nthe surface of the Earth. The background image is a meridional slice of the GCPM electron436\ndensity. Ray family 1 consists of rays that propagate directly from the chorus source region437\nto Palmer without magnetospherically re\recting (MR), and family 2 consists of rays that438\nMR at the plasmapause boundary, which allows them access into the plasmapause before439\nreaching Palmer. Because raytracing is performed in three dimensions, the ray paths and440\nwave normals have been projected into the MLT = 06 meridional plane.441\nPanel (b) shows the initial refractive index surfaces for the representative rays.

First, panel (c) shows the attenuation449\nof the representative rays over the course of their magnetospheric propagation due to450\nLandau damping, as discussed in Section 4.1. The majority of damping occurs at high451\nL-shells outside the plasmasphere. In particular, once ray 2 enters the plasmasphere, the452\nattenuation due to Landau damping is negligible. Unlike some other studies of raytracing453\n[e.g. Bortnik et al., 2007a, b], this study does not include a geometric e\u000bect in determining454\nthe power gain or loss due to the focusing of magnetic \feld lines at low altitudes. Instead,455\nthis focusing or defocusing happens naturally through the use of a large number of rays.456\nThe second mode of attenuation, shown in panel (d), is attenuation from457\nEarth-ionosphere waveguide propagation. Each ray begins at 1000-km altitude with458\nthe injection point footprint a distance d from Palmer station, where d \u0014 1000 km.459\nEarth-ionosphere waveguide attenuation is calculated using the full wave model of Lehti-460\nnen and Inan [2008, 2009]. A summer night-time ionospheric pro\fle and a perfectly461\nconducting ground layer (representative of Palmer's primarily all-sea paths) are used. A462\nGaussian wave packet of the appropriate frequency is injected at 140 km altitude with463\nvertical (downward) wave normal. The ground power at various distances from the source464\nis recorded, normalized by the ground power directly beneath the source. The resulting465\nquantity A(d) represents an attenuation factor for Earth-ionosphere waveguide propaga-466\ntion, as a function of d, by which each ray's power is multiplied. The full wave model is467\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nX - 24 GOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS\nrun only once for any given frequency, and the quantity A(d) is assumed to be valid for468\nall modeled rays within 1000 km of Palmer. The two example rays reach the ground at469\n\u0018 450 km and \u0018 215 km from Palmer, respectively, and are marked as such in panel (d).470\nWhen both Landau damping and Earth-ionosphere waveguide attenuation are considered,471\nthere can be wide variations in the attenuation of di\u000berent rays in a given family, due472\nto the fact that slight variations in initial conditions may give rise to large variations in473\npropagation paths and ionospheric penetration points.474\nPanel (e) is a plot of \\source factor\" as a function of radial extent, R. This plot is475\nderived from Burtis and Helliwell [1976, Figure 9c], which shows chorus occurrence as476\na function of f=fceq. We de\fne source factor as the observed occurrence of Burtis and477\nHelliwell [1976, Figure 9c], normalized so that the maximum value is 1. Here, source478\nfactor is plotted against R, using the T96 magnetic \feld model to map from f=fceq to479\nR. The source factor plot is then the relative expected likelihood of observing a 1 kHz480\nchorus source at a given radial extent in the equatorial plane. Because the measurements481\nof Burtis and Helliwell [1976] include both waves inside and outside the plasmasphere, it482\nis possible that the observed chorus percentage is arti\fcially low at low f=fceq or R due to483\nthose measurements being taken within the plasmasphere where chorus is generally not484\nobserved. The use of the source factor in deriving the Chorus Availability Factor (CHAF)485\nis discussed in Section 4.3, and due to the possible confounding e\u000bects of its constituent486\ndata containing measurements inside the plasmasphere, CHAF is derived both with and487\nwithout implementing the source factor.488\nAfter building a list of potential chorus source locations from the 1040 original rays, the489\namplitude of any given R- bin is set to the maximum ray amplitude in that bin after490\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nGOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS X - 25\nattenuation both via Landau damping in the magnetosphere and via attenuation in the491\nEarth-ionosphere waveguide. We refer to a plot of the binned results for a simulation with492\na given wave frequency and plasmapause extent as a \\source attenuation plot.\"493\nPanel (f) shows a source attenuation plot for a simulation where LPP = 2:9, from which494\nthe two example rays are drawn. The local resonance cone angle,  res, de\fned as the wave495\nnormal angle at which the magnitude of the refractive index goes to in\fnity, is indicated496\nby the solid black lines. The local Gendrin angle,  g, de\fned as the nonzero wave normal497\nangle at which the group velocity vector is parallel to the static magnetic \feld, is indicated498\nby the dashed black lines. The two separate ray families, from which the above example499\nrays are drawn, are highlighted with red boxes. The rays do not show any particular500\nrelationship with the resonance cone or Gendrin angles.501\nFigure 7 is analogous to Figure 6, but for 4 kHz waves. Because f is increased, the502\nmagenta lines, indicating the contours of f=fceq = 0:1 and f=fceq = 0:5 are now closer to503\nthe Earth, and both boundaries of the chorus source region can be seen. In addition,504\nthere are now four ray families, representing the direct path, and one, two and three505\nmagnetospheric re\rections. In all cases, the damping is most signi\fcant at large L-shells506\noutside the plasmasphere, where wave normals are most oblique. Rays 3 and 4 begin with507\ntheir wave normals directed away from the Earth, near the resonance cone. After the508\n\frst magnetospheric re\rection, they appear to be guided by the plasmapause boundary509\nbefore re\recting from the inner boundary. This has the e\u000bect of rotating the wave normal510\ntowards the Earth, allowing the rays to reach the ground. Because Rays 3 and 4 spend511\nmore time outside the plasmasphere, and have more highly oblique wave normals than do512\nrays 1 and 2, they are damped more heavily during their propagation.513\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nX - 26 GOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS\nIn the 4 kHz case, the initial wave normals of some ray families do show a relationship514\nwith the resonance cone and Gendrin angles. Some rays from families 1 and 2 tend515\nto be generated near the Gendrin angle, while some rays from families 3 and 4 tend516\nto be generated near the resonance cone angle. The associations are loose, and no ray517\nfamilies appear constrained to either the resonance cone or the Gendrin angle. The518\nrelation between the wave normals of ray family 1 (the direct path) and the Gendrin519\nangle is consistent with the work of Chum and Santol\u0013\u0010k [2005], who found that certain520\nrays generated with wave normals in the vicinity of the Gendrin angle would reach low521\naltitudes and possibly penetrate to the ground before being magnetospherically re\rected.522\nAlthough this behavior is seen in our results at 4 kHz, it is not observed at 1 kHz. This is523\npossibly due to the fact that Chum and Santol\u0013\u0010k [2005] did not include Landau damping524\nin their calculations. Although some 1 kHz rays in our study do begin at the equatorial525\nplane with wave normals near the Gendrin angle, those waves are damped to negligible526\npower in the simulation, and therefore do not appear on the source attenuation plot in527\nFigure 6f.528\n4.3. Chorus Availability Factor\nFigures 6f and 7f showed source attenuation plots at 1 kHz and 4 kHz for a single529\nplasmapause extent, LPP = 2:9. This analysis is repeated for many di\u000berent values of530\nLPP to gain insight into the particular way in which the plasmapause extent a\u000bects the531\nability for chorus waves to propagate from their source to Palmer. Figure 8 shows source532\nattenuation plots for 1 kHz (upper panels) and 4 kHz (lower panels) for plasmapause533\nextents in the range 2:1 \u0014 LPP \u0014 4:3. The color scale has been changed slightly for clarity.534\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nGOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS X - 27\nInitially, we focus our discussion on the 1 kHz case, in the upper panels of Figures 8. At535\nthe greatest plasmapause extent, LPP = 4:3, rays from the chorus source region are not536\naccessible to Palmer; reverse rays launched from Palmer are either unable to escape the537\nplasmasphere, and instead re\rect o\u000b of its inner boundary before impacting the ionosphere538\nin the conjugate hemisphere, or they escape the plasmasphere with oblique wave normals539\nand are heavily damped before crossing the equatorial plane. As the plasmasphere be-540\ncomes more eroded down to LPP = 2:9, although rays as far out as L = 7 are accessible541\nto Palmer (not shown), most are severely damped; only certain rays that originate within542\n4:2 . L . 4:6 su\u000eciently avoid damping to be received above the \u000070 dB cuto\u000b. Ero-543\nsion of the plasmasphere beyond LPP = 2:9 results in increased propagation time outside544\nthe plasmasphere, and hence, increased damping, particularly for waves with initial wave545\nnormals  \u0018 50\u000e. The situation is similar for 4 kHz. For high LPP, rays from the chorus546\nsource region cannot reach Palmer; reverse rays are unable to escape the plasmasphere.547\nFor LPP \u0018 2:9, a maximum of rays reach Palmer with signi\fcant power. For low LPP, as548\nfor high LPP most reverse rays launched from Palmer do not escape the plasmasphere.549\nOne important di\u000berence between the simulations at 1 kHz and 4 kHz is where the550\nplasmapause lies with respect to the extents of the chorus source region, de\fned by551\n0:1 \u0014 f=fceq \u0014 0:5. At 1 kHz, the source region is in the range 4:2 \u0014 L \u0014 6:9, which552\nis beyond the plasmapause for almost all simulations. However, at 4 kHz, the source553\nregion is in the range 2:7 \u0014 L \u0014 4:5, which means that for many of the simulations, the554\nplasmasphere overlaps the chorus source region. This is why, in the lower panels of Fig-555\nure 8, the chorus source region appears to expand to the left as LPP decreases. The556\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nX - 28 GOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS\nplasmapause is moving to the left of the plots, and a greater portion of the chorus source557\nregion is becoming available.558\nBecause rays may be substantially damped over the course of propagation, in order559\nto properly analyze the results of the simulations, it is necessary to de\fne a \\minimum560\ndetectable ray power,\" below which rays are excluded from the analysis. To \frst order,561\nthis can be achieved by comparing the mean power observed on the ground with the562\nmean power observed via in situ measurements. A histogram of observed amplitudes over563\nthe course of this study, overlaid with the associated probability distribution, is shown564\nin Figure 9. Chorus amplitudes observed at Palmer are distributed approximately log-565\nnormally, as566\nAdB \u0018 lnN (\u0016 = 3:5; \u001b2 = 0:036) (13)\nwith mean 35 dB-fT and standard deviation 6.8 dB-fT. The observed mean of 35 dB-fT567\nat Palmer can be compared with the mean B-\feld amplitude calculated by Santol\u0013\u0010k [2008],568\nbased on equatorial chorus E-\feld measurements fromMeredith et al. [2001], of 10-100 pT,569\nor 80-100 dB-fT. Comparing the two numbers, up to \u0018 65 dB of attenuation is expected570\nfrom the equatorial source region to Palmer. However, in this analysis, we are not mod-571\neling attenuation su\u000bered through trans-ionospheric propagation. Trans-ionospheric at-572\ntenuation is expected to be on the order of \u0018 5 dB, somewhere between the daytime and573\nnighttime attenuation calculations of Helliwell [1965, Fig. 3-35] for 2 kHz waves (since574\nour simulations are run at 06 MLT). This leaves an expected attenuation from Landau575\ndamping and Earth-ionosphere waveguide losses of \u0018 60 dB. To account for the lower end576\nof our observed power distribution, which reaches down to \u0018 25 dB-fT in Figure 9, an577\nadditional 10 dB of loss is allowed. Thus, we de\fne our minimum detectable ray power to578\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nGOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS X - 29\nbe \u000070 dB. Although it is necessary to de\fne a minimum detectable ray power to perform579\nthe following analysis, our conclusions are not strongly dependent on its exact value.580\nWe de\fne the CHAF for a given frequency and LPP as follows. First, all bins of a581\ngiven simulation (i.e., from a source attenuation plot, such as Figure 6f) are normalized582\nby adding 70 dB to each bin, which ensures that bin values are all positive, between 0 and583\n70 dB. Then, each bin is multiplied by the source factor (e.g., Figure 6e), at its particular584\nradial extent. E.g., the bins at the lowest radial extent in Figure 6f, at R \u0018 4:2 RE ,585\nare multiplied by the source factor of Figure 6e at that same radial extent, which is586\napproximately 0.05. This has the e\u000bect of reducing the in\ruence of bins that are at radial587\nextents at which chorus is less-commonly observed. Finally, the values of the bins are588\nsummed, and the resulting scalar quantity, as a function of frequency and LPP, is the589\nCHAF.590\nThe CHAF of the 1 kHz and 4 kHz simulations is shown in the left panels of Figure 10.591\nThe calculated CHAF both before and after applying the source factor are shown in gray592\nand black lines, respectively. It can be seen that application of the source factor makes593\nonly a minor di\u000berence in the trend of CHAF with LPP for either frequency. This shows594\nthat, even if the fact that chorus is preferentially generated at certain values of f=fceq is595\nnot included (for example, due to the fact that the source factor may arti\fcially reduce596\nthe e\u000bect of chorus originating at low L-shells outside the plasmasphere) the plasmapause597\nhas a similar e\u000bect in dictating the amplitude of received chorus.598\nBecause CHAF is derived from the data that makes up the source attenuation plots599\nin Figure 8, its behavior with respect to LPP is analogous to that in Figure 8. As LPP600\ndecreases from LPP = 4:3 to LPP = 2:1, the availability of di\u000berent portions of the chorus601\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nX - 30 GOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS\nsource region wax and wane, which translates into increasing and decreasing CHAF. At602\n1 kHz, CHAF is maximized for LPP = 3:1, where two regions, narrow in  and broad in603\nR are accessible to Palmer. At 4 kHz, CHAF is maximized for LPP = 2:9, where several604\nbroad regions of the source region are accessible to Palmer. These regions are made up of605\nrays from the di\u000berent ray families discussed in Section 4.2.606\n4.4. Comparison With Observations\nWe would like to compare the simulated CHAF to the experimental results of Sec-607\ntion 3.2. If the variation in chorus occurrence as a function of LPP observed in Section 3.2608\nis primarily a propagation e\u000bect, then CHAF should behave similarly to the empirically609\nmodeled normalized chorus occurrence probability, \u0016, as a function of LPP. Note that610\nCHAF is merely a proxy measurement of chorus observed probability and is not a prob-611\nability. To form a proper probability estimation from this data, it would be necessary to612\nestimate the distribution of chorus power as a function of radial distance or f=fceq and613\ninitial wave normal angle. For lack of this information, we have assumed uniform initial614\npower at all wave normals and radial distances.615\nFigure 10 shows a comparison of the CHAF at 1 and 4 kHz with the equivalent univariate616\ngeneralized linear model (GLM) results for \u0016. The GLM results shown here are limited617\nto chorus occurring at 1 and 4 kHz, instead of the ranges f < 1:5 kHz and f > 3 kHz618\nshown in Figure 4. First, and most importantly, the saturation e\u000bect is reproduced for619\nboth frequencies. Both \u0016 and CHAF initially increase with decreasing LPP, reach a peak,620\nand then decrease. Their peaks are within 0.5 L. This similarity between CHAF and \u0016 is621\nstrongly indicative of the fact that the behavior of \u0016 with respect to LPP is a propagation622\ne\u000bect and not a source e\u000bect (since only propagation e\u000bects are included in the raytracing).623\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nGOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS X - 31\nHowever, we also note the important discrepancy between the LPP values for the peaks624\nof CHAF and the peaks of \u0016. For 1 kHz, the peak of \u0016 is at LPP = 2:6, whereas that625\nfor CHAF is at LPP = 3:1, a di\u000berence of 0.5 RE. The random error in the measured626\nvalue of LPP for either \u0016 (measured by clicking on equatorially-mapped EUV images) or627\nCHAF (measured by direct examination of an equatorial slice through the GCPM grid)628\nis estimated to be \u00060:1 RE, but this is too small to account for the observed discrepancy.629\nSimilarly for 4 kHz, the observed peaks are at LPP = 2:7 and LPP = 2:9, respectively, a630\nsmaller di\u000berence of 0.2 RE.631\nThere are several di\u000berent possible causes for the discrepancy between the peaks in \u0016632\nand CHAF. The \frst and most obvious cause may be errors in particle densities from the633\nGCPM density model, either in the absolute density or in density gradients. The GCPM634\nmodel necessarily represents \\averaged\" conditions for its input values, and may contain635\nsystematic biases with respect to the true magnetospheric conditions under which chorus636\nis observed at Palmer.637\nAnother cause may lie in our use of a hybrid energetic electron distribution when cal-638\nculating Landau damping. The CRRES distribution used outside the plasmasphere uses639\ndata from disturbed periods, when AE > 300 nT. However, the POLAR distribution used640\ninside the plasmasphere uses data from quiet-to-moderate conditions, when Kp \u0014 4. Be-641\ncause chorus tends to peak during active periods, the use of quiet\/moderate \ruxes within642\nthe plasmasphere has the e\u000bect of arti\fcially lowering the energetic particle \rux inside the643\nplasmasphere, therefore lowering the damping coe\u000ecients and allowing rays to propagate644\nfor a long time within the plasmasphere. Thus, at 1 kHz, ray family 2 from Figure 6,645\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nX - 32 GOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS\nwhich involves extended propagation within the plasmasphere, and which is dominant for646\nLPP & 2:7, may be less in\ruential than modeled.647\nFinally, by excluding the prevalent density irregularities that permeate the plasmasphere648\n[e.g. Carpenter et al., 2002, and references therein], we neglect what may be a signi\fcant649\npopulation of waves that are guided by these irregularities. In particular, in the real650\nplasmasphere, density irregularities in the vicinity of the plasmapause may preferentially651\nguide waves to Palmer when the plasmapause is at lower L-shells [Inan and Bell , 1977].652\nThe exclusion of irregularities is an inevitable consequence of using an \\averaged\" plasma653\ndensity model, such as the GCPM model for the plasma density. A full discussion of the654\ne\u000bects of guiding by density irregularities is beyond the scope of this study.655\nOne other important discrepancy between the plots of \u0016 and CHAF is that the rela-656\ntive value of \u0016 for low frequencies is signi\fcantly greater than that for high frequencies657\n(right panels), whereas the opposite relation is true for CHAF (left panels). This may be658\ndue to the fact that higher-frequency waves tend to be generated with lower amplitudes659\n[Burtis and Helliwell , 1975], whereas we have assumed in our raytracing analysis that the660\namplitude of generated waves is the same across all frequencies.661\n5. Conclusions\nWe have proposed in this study that the extent of the plasmapause, denoted LPP, plays662\na large role in determining the ability for chorus waves to propagate from their equatorial663\nmagnetospheric source region to the ground. Using wave data from the ground-based664\nreceiver at Palmer Station, Antarctica, together with plasmapause data from the IMAGE665\nEUV instrument, a generalized linear model regression was employed in Section 3.2 to666\nshow the strong dependence of chorus normalized occurrence on LPP.667\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nGOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS X - 33\nThe separability of AE and LPP shown in Section 3.3 provides evidence that the de-668\npendence of chorus occurrence on LPP is in fact a propagation e\u000bect, and not simply a669\nconfounding source e\u000bect (i.e., a consequence of the fact that magnetic substorms both670\ngive rise to chorus generation and, separately, cause erosion of the plasmasphere). In671\nparticular, Figure 5 shows that the general trend of normalized occurrence vs. plasma-672\npause persists across a wide range of AE values. This shows that the relation of chorus673\noccurrence to AE (a proxy measure of a source e\u000bect), is separable from the relation of674\nchorus occurrence to LPP (a measure of a propagation e\u000bect), and therefore, that there is675\na signi\fcant in\ruence of instantaneous plasmapause extent in determining whether chorus676\ncan reach Palmer.677\nThese conclusions were solidi\fed via a reverse raytracing study. By launching rays678\nfrom Palmer and tracking their power, wave normal, and equatorial crossings through679\nthe expected chorus source region, a measure of the portion of the chorus source region680\nfrom which rays may reach Palmer was obtained, which we termed the Chorus Avail-681\nability Factor, or CHAF. The most salient similarity between how the experimentally682\nobserved chorus occurrence (\u0016) and the raytracing model (CHAF) depend on LPP is the683\nso-called saturation e\u000bect, where during experimental observations, chorus is observed on684\nthe ground most often for L \u0018 2:6. It was shown in Section 4.4 that this e\u000bect is repro-685\nduced via raytracing (with a small systematic error in the exact value of LPP) by varying686\nonly LPP; this eliminates the possibility of a confounding source e\u000bect, and further en-687\nforces the conclusion that the plasmapause extent has a direct e\u000bect on allowing chorus688\naccess to the ground.689\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nX - 34 GOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS\nThe peak of the saturation, either the observed peak of 2:6 . LPP . 2:7 or the modeled690\npeak of 2:9 . LPP . 3:1, is somewhat higher than Palmer's location at L = 2:4. One691\nmight na\u0010vely expect the peak of chorus to occur at LPP = 2:4, because it is at that692\nplasmasphere extent that Palmer station lies on the plasmapause boundary. However, this693\ntheory neglects the mechanism of rays reaching Palmer via magnetospherically re\recting694\nat the northern plasmapause boundary, as in ray family 2 from Figure 6 and ray families695\n2, 3 and 4 from Figure 7. This can can occur at high plasmapause extents, and the696\nprevalence of this mode of propagation may be one explanation for why chorus is often697\nobserved at Palmer even when the plasmapause is beyond L = 2:4.698\nAdditionally, by raytracing in a smooth magnetosphere (except for the obvious density699\ngradient of the plasmapause itself), it was shown that it is possible for chorus to reach the700\nionosphere within the transmission cone and penetrate to the ground in the absence of701\nany \feld-aligned guiding structures. This is in contrast to long-held colloquial belief that702\nonly ducted chorus may access the ground. In fact, in light of the similarities between703\nthe raytracing and the experimentally-observed results, it seems plausible that non-ducted704\nchorus is the dominant mode of chorus observed on the ground. Without the constraint of705\na \feld-aligned guiding structure, chorus is able to cross L-shells as it propagates from the706\nsource region to the ground. This explains why Palmer Station, located at a signi\fcantly-707\nlower L-shell than that of the typical chorus source region, is able to observe chorus as708\noften as it does.709\nWe conclude by saying that, due to the fact that mid-latitude ground observations of710\nchorus are likely to result from nonducted propagation, these observations are by no means711\nlimited to chorus source regions that lie on the same L-shell as the receiver.

Panel (a) shows the expected value of normalized occurrence, and panels (b)\nand (c) show the upper and lower bounds of the 95% con\fdence interval for \u0016.\nFigure 6. Two 1 kHz ray families that are capable of being received at Palmer. (a)\nRepresentative raypaths from each of two ray families. Family 1 is the direct path from\nthe source region to Palmer, and family 2 includes rays that magnetospherically re\rect\ninto the plasmasphere before their reception on the ground. (b) Initial refractive index\nsurfaces for example rays. (c) Attenuation of example rays vs. time over the course of\nraytracing, via Landau damping. (d) Attenuation of example rays vs. distance within the\nEarth-ionosphere waveguide, via full wave modeling. (e) Source factor showing relative\nexpected chorus vs. radial extent. (f) Source attenuation plot of relative received power\nvs. wave normal  and radial extent. Solid lines indicate the local resonance cone angle,\n res, and dashed lines indicate the local Gendrin angle,  g. The two families of similar\nrays, labeled 1 and 2, correspond to the two example rays from the previous panels.\nFigure 7. Same as Figure 6, but for 4 kHz. At this frequency, there are four distinct\nray families, representing the direct path, and one, two and three magnetic re\rections.\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\nGOLDEN ET AL.: THE PLASMAPAUSE AND CHORUS X - 47\nFigure 8. Source attenuation plots for f = 1 kHz (upper panels) and f = 4 kHz (lower\npanels) for plasmapause extents in the range 2:1 \u0014 LPP \u0014 4:3. Note that the scales of the\nx-axes in the upper and lower panels are not the same.\nFigure 9. Histogram and log-normal probability distribution function (PDF) of ob-\nserved chorus amplitudes at Palmer. Bins of the histogram have been normalized by\nthe total number of samples and the bin width, so that they have the same units as the\nlog-normal PDF.\nFigure 10. Comparison of CHAF from raytracing (left) with generalized linear model\nof occurrence probability, \u0016, derived from measurements (right). CHAF is calculated from\nconstituent data of the source attenuation plots of Figure 8. \u0016 is calculated using data\nat single frequencies 1 kHz and 4 kHz, instead of a range of frequencies as in Section 3.2.\nAs before, on the plot of \u0016, the solid black line indicates \u0016, and the shaded area indicates\nthe 95% con\fdence interval. The lighter-colored line on the plots of CHAF represent the\nvalues prior to applying the source factor from Burtis and Helliwell [1976], and the darker\nlines represent values after applying the source factor. The shapes of the curves with and\nwithout the source factor applied are very similar. Note that the scales of the x-axes in\nthe upper and lower panels, and on the overlaid plots of CHAF, are not the same.\nD R A F T Monday 23rd August, 2010, 5:05pm D R A F T\navg\n dB\n\u2212fT\n\/Hz\n1\/2\n\u221220\n\u221219\n\u221218\n10\n3\n4\n5\n6\nPla\nsm\napa\nuse\n ex\nten\nt (R\nE)\n3\n4\n5\n6N = 0 N = 12\navg AE in previous N hours (nT)\n100 1000 10 100 1000\n\nNormalized occurrence (\u03bc)\nNormalized occurrence (\u00b5, mean)\nPla\nsm\napa\nuse\n ex\nten\nt (R\nE)\nAE (nT)50 100 200 500 1000\n3\n4\n5\n6\n4\n6\nAE (nT)100 1000\n4\n6\n\ud835\udf07, lower 95% C.I.\n\u00b5, upper 95% C.I.\nNorm occur0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n(a) (b)\n(c)\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5\u221260\n\u221230\n0\nTime (sec)\nRa\ny a\ntten\n.
