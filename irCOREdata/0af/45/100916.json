In order to reach longer wavelengths the dots\nhave to be larger than that needed for 1.3 \u0001m operation.\nGrowing 1.55 \u0001m quantum dots on GaAs is therefore diffi-\ncult because of the large strain that accumulates during the\nStranski-Krastanow growth.2 A possible alternative is to\ngrow InAs dots on InP substrates which have a much smaller\nlattice mismatch with InAs \u00013.2%\u0002 compared with GaAs\n\u00017%\u0002. Molecular beam epitaxy on \u0001100\u0002 InP substrates has\nalready allowed the growth of quantum dots3 or quantum\ndashes,4 which has led to the demonstration of high perfor-\nmance lasers.4,5 Also, the use of the specific InP\u0001311\u0002B ori-\nentation has already allowed three-dimensional confined\nnanostructures with a QD density as high as 1011 cm\u22122 \u0001Ref.\n6\u0002 to be demonstrated as well as a low chirp of 2.5 Gb\/s for\na directly modulated single mode waveguide laser emitting\nat 1.6 \u0001m.7 Recently, an InAs\/ InP\u0001311\u0002B narrow ridge\nsingle mode waveguide laser emitting on the ground state at\n1516 nm under continuous wave operation at room tempera-\nture was reported.8\nIn this letter we report on a detailed experimental study\nof the recombination processes that occur in 1.5 \u0001m\nInAs\/ InP \u0001311\u0002B QD lasers. A set of 1.5 mm long, 100 \u0001m\nwide ridge lasers were used for this study. Their active region\nconsists of five layers of dots deposited using the double-cap\nprocedure9 in a Ga0.2In0.8As0.435P0.565 waveguide. The dot\ndensity is \u00061011 dots\/cm2, as determined from atomic force\nmicroscopy measurements. At room temperature the thresh-\nold current densities were typically \u0006500 A\/cm2 and the T0\n\u0004=1\/ \u0001d ln Ith \/dT\u0002\u0005 was \u000655 K for temperatures ranging from\n0 to 50 \u00b0C. In order to understand the recombination pro-\ncesses which take place in these devices, measurements of\nthe threshold current \u0001Ith\u0002 and its radiative component \u0001Irad\u0002\nwere performed as a function of pressure and temperature.\nThe radiative current was determined by integrating unam-\nplified spontaneous emission spectra obtained from a\n100 \u0001m diameter circular window milled in the substrate\ncontact. This ensures that one is measuring the pure sponta-\nneous emission independent of the effect of gain and loss\nalong the cavity. A closed-cycle helium cryostat was used for\nthe temperature-dependent measurements while a piston-in-\ncylinder apparatus \u0001as described in Ref. 10\u0002 was used for\nhigh hydrostatic pressure measurements. In both setups the\nlasers were positioned in a spring clip and were driven by a\npulsed source with 500 ns long pulses and a repetition rate of\n2 kHz to minimize internal heating.\nThe results of the temperature measurements are shown\nin Fig. 1. It can be seen that the radiative current remains\napproximately constant over this temperature range, as origi-\na\u0002Electronic mail: s.sweeney@surrey.ac.uk\nFIG. 1.

In the 1.5 \u0001m de-\nvices studied here, the energy difference between the ground\nstate \u0001GS\u0002 transition of the wetting layer and the GS transi-\ntion of the QD is \u0006110 meV for both holes and electrons, as\nshown in the inset of Fig. 1, compared with \u0006300 meV in\n1.3 \u0001m InAs\/GaAs QD lasers.13 This is a direct conse-\nquence of the smaller lattice mismatch in InAs\/ InP com-\npared to InAs\/GaAs, which generates a thick wetting layer\ncompared to the dimensions of the dots.2 Consequently, the\ntemperature at which thermal equilibrium is reached is ex-\npected to be much less than 200 K in the 1.5 \u0001m lasers. The\nthermal distribution and the atomiclike nature of the energy\nlevels thus lead to an almost constant Irad over a large tem-\nperature range. The measurements show that Irad increases\nvery weakly \u0001\u000610% \u0002 from 200 to 270 K which could be an\neffect of either thermal broadening and\/or gain\nsaturation.14,15\nIn Fig. 1, Irad was normalized to the value of Ith at the\nlowest measured temperature where we assume that Irad= Ith.\nHowever, we note that the absolute value of Irad might, in\nfact, be less than this, if, for example, another nonradiative\npath is present. Figure 1 shows that while Irad is almost con-\nstant \u0001and hence the gain is approximately constant\u0002, the\nthreshold current increases steeply with increasing tempera-\nture. Clearly, this increase is due to a strong temperature\ndependent nonradiative recombination mechanism which ac-\ncounts for at least 90% of the total threshold current at room\ntemperature. Pure spontaneous emission spectra show light\nemission at 0.95 eV; the peak of which corresponds to the\ntransition energy of the wetting layer \u0001inset of Fig. 1\u0002. Due to\nits small layer thickness reabsorption is expected to be neg-\nligible. This is a sign that electrons are thermalizing into the\nwetting layer and, subsequently, undergoing radiative and\npossibly nonradiative recombination in the wetting layer. We\nnote, however, that the integrated emission from the wetting\nlayer accounts for only \u000613% of the total spontaneous emis-\nsion at threshold and at room temperature. The peak which\nappears to be at 0.88 eV is likely to be due to the electron\nfirst excited state, but interference effects cannot be ruled out\nat this stage. However, it is clear that the total radiative con-\ntribution to the threshold current is small and recombination\nthrough the first excited state makes a negligible direct con-\ntribution to the total current or its temperature sensitivity.\nIn order to get more information about the dominating\nnonradiative recombination process, high hydrostatic pres-\nsure measurements were carried out. Hydrostatic pressure\nincreases the direct band gap of III\/V semiconductors by\ndecreasing the interatomic spacing. Since the carrier recom-\nbination processes have different band gap dependencies,\nthis allows one to separate which process dominates at\nthreshold.16 In the devices studied here, the lasing energy\nincreases by \u00068.4 meV\/kbars \u0001inset of Fig. 2\u0002. The results\nof the lasing-energy dependence of the threshold current are\nshown in Fig. 2. Ith is found to decrease by \u000640% over\n\u000663 meV at room temperature.\nClearly, since the radiative current is less than \u000610% of\nthe total current, this shows that the nonradiative component\nof the current must decrease with increasing pressure. Al-\nthough it has not yet been measured for this type of device,\nIrad is expected to increase with pressure as has previously\nbeen measured in 1.5 \u0001m InGaAs\/ InP quantum well lasers17\nand 1.3 \u0001m InAs\/GaAs QD lasers.18 If Irad increases while\nIth decreases with increasing pressure, this suggests that the\ndominant recombination process decreases even more\nstrongly with pressure than Ith. Initial photocurrent measure-\nments carried under pressure suggest that the band offset is\napproximately pressure independent within experimental er-\nror. Carrier leakage into the wetting or barrier layers is thus\nexpected to be pressure independent. Previous calculations\nhave shown that the rate of Auger recombination decreases\nwith pressure in quantum dots due to the decreased overlap\nof the electron and hole wavefunctions involved in the Auger\nprocess with increasing band gap.16 The measured decrease\nin threshold current with pressure \u0001band gap\u0002 is therefore\nconsistent with nonradiative Auger recombination dominat-\ning the threshold current at room temperature.\nIn summary we have measured the temperature depen-\ndence of the radiative and threshold currents of 1.5 \u0001m\nInAs\/ InP \u0001311\u0002B quantum dot lasers. The relatively small\nstrain induces a confinement potential of about 110 meV.\nThe results show that the interdot carrier transport via the\nwetting layer effectively leads to an almost temperature\nstable radiative current over the range of temperatures stud-\nied here. Carrier recombination in the wetting layer is di-\nrectly observed suggesting that there is some carrier leakage.\nHowever, pressure measurements of the threshold current\nsuggest that Auger recombination plays an even more domi-\nnant role in these devices than in 1.3 \u0001m InAs\/GaAs quan-\ntum dot lasers.\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge EPSRC \u0001UK\u0002, R\u00e9-\ngion Bretagne and European Union Networks of Excellence\nePIXnet, and SANDiE for financial support.\n1K.
