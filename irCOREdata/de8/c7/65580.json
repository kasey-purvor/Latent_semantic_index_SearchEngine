The most commonly used tool for assessing relative interest in \nshort term sexual relationships is the Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI) developed by Simpson & \nGangestad (1991). The SOI was developed to assess individual propensity to engage in short-term sexual \nrelationships. A high score on the SOI indicates an \u2018unrestricted\u2019 sociosexuality (i.e. being more open to \nshort-term sexual relationships) while a low score indicates a \u2018restricted\u2019 sociosexuality (i.e. being less \nwilling to engage in short-term sexual relationships).  \n \nUsing the SOI, Gangestad, Simpson, DiGeronimo & Biek (1992) demonstrated that female observers \ncould accurately assess the sociosexual orientation of men solely from visual cues such as their \nappearance and body language. In Gangestad et al\u2019s study, female observers rated the sociosexuality of \nmen after viewing silent video-taped footage of them talking to a camera as if to a potential date. While \nthis video technique produced high ecological validity, it cannot distinguish whether the female observers \nwere using cues related to the physical appearance or the body language of the video-taped males. \n \nIt may, however, be possible to assess sociosexuality based on physical appearance alone in the absence \nof movement cues.  Less restricted sociosexuality (i.e. greater willingness to engage in short-term \nrelationships) has been shown by Clark (2004) to be linked to greater masculinisation in female cognitive \n(better mental rotation ability) and physical (smaller second-fourth digit ratio) traits.  Such \nmasculinisation may also be visible in female faces, possibly leading to a more masculine appearance (see \nSchaefer, Fink, Mitteroecker, Neave & Bookstein, 2005, for evidence regarding digit ratio and facial \nshape; although cf Koehler, Simmons & Rhodes, 2004). Clark also found evidence that less restricted \nfemales rated themselves as being more attractive.  Contrastingly, Rhodes, Simmons & Peters (2005) \n 4\nfound that more feminine-looking females and more masculine-looking males reported having had more \nsexual partners (although more feminine-looking females also reported having had more long-term \npartners, suggesting that opportunity for relationships may mediate the association between femininity \nand number of sexual partners, rather than the sociosexual orientation of feminine women).  \n \nIn males, less restricted sociosexuality has been linked to decreased fluctuating asymmetry in both the \nface and body (Thornhill & Gangestad, 1994; Simpson, Gangestad, Christensen & Leck, 1999). \nSimilarly, Rhodes et al (2005) found that women with more symmetric-looking bodies reported having \nmore sexual partners.  Low levels of fluctuating asymmetry are considered to be attractive in potential \npartners\u2019 faces (Penton-Voak et al, 2001; Rhodes et al, 2001) and thus we hypothesise that less restricted \n(and ergo more symmetrical) individuals should be more attractive. Indeed, amongst males, possession of \nattractive traits such as low levels of fluctuating asymmetry should positively predict an interest by that \nmale in short term relationships, because their \u2018valuable\u2019 genes are in demand (Gangestad & Simpson, \n2000).  Therefore it may be that observers can use these cues (attractiveness, symmetry and masculinity) \nto distinguish between individuals with unrestricted (short-term) and restricted (long-term) relationship \nstrategies purely on the basis of facial appearance in static images. \n \nAlthough we know of no published studies linking the sociosexuality of individuals to their facial \nappearance in static photographs, several studies to date have found that observers can predict an \nindividual\u2019s behaviour based solely on appearance in a photograph. For instance, Berry & Wero (1993) \nshowed that observers could accurately determine which psychology students would be most likely to \nagree to deceive experimental participants.  Similarly, Yamagishi, Tanida, Mashima, Shimoma & \nKanazawa (2003) found that observers could identify the individuals who were likely to cheat in \nprisoner\u2019s dilemma tasks.  Most recently, Penton-Voak, Pound, Little & Perrett (2006) found that \nobservers could accurately ascribe certain aspects of 5-factor personality scores to strangers\u2019 faces.  Like \ndeception and core personality, sexual behaviour is a domain of social behaviour which it may be \n 5\nadvantageous for an observer to be able to predict in both potential partners (for instance, avoiding \nunsuitable long\/short term mates before expending energy in pursuit) and also in potential rivals, \nselection for which would result in a generalised ability to judge the likely sociosexual orientation of \nothers (see e.g. Boothroyd, Jones, Burt & Perrett, 2007, for evidence of males and females showing \nsimilar judgements of males\u2019 apparent fidelity).   \n \nThe studies reported here assessed both the facial characteristics associated with sociosexuality and \nwhether observers were sensitive to such facial cues.   Study 1 used composite facial images, while Study \n2 used photographs of real faces in a correlational method. \n 6\nSTUDY 1 \nStudy 1 used facial composites of unrestricted (open to short-term relationships) and restricted (prefer \nlong-term relationships) individuals.  The principle of averaging images means that randomly varying \ntraits across two groups will tend towards average in composites, while traits that are significantly \ndifferent between groups will be more clear in composites (Perrett et al, 1994).  Thus, this method is ideal \nfor detecting subtle structural differences between groups (e.g. a larger, squarer jaw in the case of \nmasculine males) and for assessing whether groups of observers are sensitive to these differences.  If \nGangestad et al\u2019s (1992) results regarding perceptions of sociosexuality in video-clips were due to the \nphysical appearance of the men and can thus be generalised to judgements of static facial images, it \nwould be predicted that observers will rate the composites of unrestricted individuals as being more open \nto short-term relationships than the composites of restricted individuals.  Furthermore, if observers are \nable to identify an individual\u2019s sociosexual orientation, it should affect whether they would be likely to \nconsider a long-term relationship with that individual.  Therefore, composites of unrestricted individuals \nmay be judged attractive for short-term relationships, but relatively unattractive for long-term \nrelationships.  Finally, given the evidence discussed above regarding sexual behaviours, sociosexual \norientation and androgenisation, it can be predicted that facial composites of unrestricted individuals \nwould appear more masculine than those of restricted individuals. \n \nSTIMULI \n \nComposite facial images were created based on sociosexuality and were used in both Sample 1a and \nSample 1b.  Volunteers from two year-long cohorts (\u2018batch 1\u2019: 55 females, 67 males, mean age=20.6 \nyears and \u2018batch 2\u2019: 77 females, 62 males, mean age=20.0 years) of St Andrews University students were \neach photographed twice (once with a neutral expression and once smiling) with a digital camera \n(resolution set at 1200x1000 pixels) under standardised diffuse-lighting conditions with identical \nbackgrounds. They also filled out the SOI (Simpson and Gangestad, 1991) to assess their sociosexual \n 7\norientation. Computer graphic averaging (Rowland & Perrett, 1995; Tiddeman, Burt & Perrett, 2001) was \nused to create pairs of composite face images: a male pair and female pair for each year. Each pair \nconsisted of one composite of the individuals scoring in the highest quartile on the SOI (unrestricted \nindividuals; i.e. those most open to short term relationships) and a composite of the individuals scoring in \nthe lowest quartile on the SOI (restricted individuals; i.e. those least open to short term relationships). \nBoth smiling and neutral expression composites were created.  For technical reasons, smiling images of \nBatch 1 males were not available and so no composite image could be made. Thus, in total there were 4 \npairs of female stimuli and 3 pairs of male stimuli. The details of the individuals whose photographs were \nentered into each composite can be found in Table 1 and male and female neutral batch 1 images are \nshown in Figures 1 and 2 respectively.   \nTABLE 1 HERE \n \nSAMPLE 1A \n \n \nParticipants \n \n153 \u2018observers\u2019 (100 female, mean age 24.9\u00b15.5 years) assessed the faces on sociosexuality, while a \nfurther 85 \u2018observers\u2019 (54 female, mean age 24.1\u00b16.1 years) assessed the faces on attractiveness and \nmasculinity\/femininity.  Participants were recruited across the internet from sites advertising online \npsychology experiments, and from the experimenters\u2019 own websites.  To exclude multiple responses by \nindividual observers, each time the experiment was started the application generated a participant \nreference number; only data from unique reference numbers and IP addresses were analyzed.   \n \nProcedure \n \nObservers followed a link to an initial questionnaire in which they indicated their sex, age and sexual \norientation (on a 1-7 Likert scale, 7 being exclusively heterosexual). As the study assessed opposite sex \n 8\nattractiveness, observers who indicated a tendency towards homosexuality (scoring less than 4 on the \nsexual orientation question) were excluded from analyses.  \n \nFollowing the questionnaire, observers were presented with the pairs of composite face images side by \nside on screen (see Boothroyd et al, 2005, for an image of the test used). An extended forced choice \nmethodology was employed in which participants indicated which face from each pair embodied the trait \nin question more, and also the extent to which this was true by choosing from the options: \u2018guess\u2019, \n\u2018slightly more\u2019, \u2018more\u2019 and \u2018much more\u2019.  Their choices were recorded as an eight point scale ranging \nfrom: 0 (indicating a strong feeling that the restricted composite was higher on the trait) to 7 (indicating a \nstrong feeling that the unrestricted composite was higher on the trait). The order of trials and the position \nof the stimuli were randomised. \n \nObservers in the group assessing perceived sociosexuality were shown each face pair once and asked \neach time to \"choose the individual that you feel is more open to short-term relationships, one night \nstands and the idea of sex without love\u201d.   \n \nAll other observers were presented with 3 blocks of trials in which they were asked to assess which face \nlooked more masculine, feminine or attractive, respectively.  The order of the blocks of trials was \nrandomised among participants. \n \nResults \n \n \nFor each characteristic, the average male and female stimulus pair scores were calculated. As all these \nscores were found to be to be normally distributed (all Kolmogorov-Smirnov z<1.3), parametric statistics \nwere used in the analysis. \n \nOne-sample t-tests were used to compare scores against the scale mid-point of 3.5 (indicating no \npreference\/choice for either face) it was found that overall, observers could successfully distinguish \n 9\nbetween restricted and unrestricted composites (male stimuli:  m=3.969, t152=3.987, p<0.001; female \nstimuli:  m= 3.811, t152=3.765, p=0.001).  However, when observers were split by sex, male observers \nwere unable to distinguish between the female composites (t53=0.075; all other results remained \nsignificant at p<0.05) \n  \nUnrestricted female composites were viewed as significantly more attractive than their restricted \ncounterparts by both male and female observers (male observers: m=3.885, t34=2.593, p<0.05; female \nobservers: m=4.027, t53=4.001, p<0.001).  However, the unrestricted male composites were viewed by \nobservers as significantly less attractive than their restricted counterparts by both male and female \nobservers (male observers: m=3.173, t34=2.116, p<0.05; female observers: m=3.118, t53=2.232, p<0.05).   \n \nUnrestricted male composites were judged as significantly more masculine than restricted male \ncomposites (m=4.913, t84=13.576, p<0.001), while unrestricted female composites were judged as \nsignificantly more feminine than restricted female composites (m=3.753, t84=3.474, p\u22640.001).  Although \nthe results for the male faces held for both sexes of observer with p<0.05, when observers were split by \ngender, male observers did not consider unrestricted and restricted female composites to differ in \nfemininity (t37=0.920). \n 10\nSAMPLE 1B  \n \nParticipants \n \n42 \u2018observers\u2019 (21 female; mean age=23.4\u00b12.7 years) were students at the University of St Andrews and \nrecruited through a general laboratory advertisement.   \nProcedure \n \nObservers completed the experiment in a laboratory setting on a computer, using a non-internet version of \nthe same methodology employed with Sample 1a (see Figure 1. for screen cap). The experiment differed \nfrom Sample 1a in that observers were asked to assess opposite sex composite image pairs for \nattractiveness as a long- or short-term partner, rather than general attractiveness, and apparent SOI was \nassessed using the slightly simpler question: \u201cWhich of these faces looks more open to short term \nrelationships and sex without love?\u201d \n \nFIGURE 1 HERE \n \nThe face image composite pairs were presented in 6 blocks of trials.  In the first two blocks, participants \nassessed only the opposite sex faces for attractiveness as a long-term partner in one block and \nattractiveness as a short-term partner in the other block (the order of these two blocks was randomised). \nIn the third block, observers assessed the attractiveness of the pairs of same sex faces. In the final 2 \nblocks, participants assessed the masculinity and sociosexuality of the all of the face pairs. The order of \nthe last 2 blocks was randomised. Throughout the experiment, the left-right position and order of \npresentation of face pairs in each block was randomised. \n \n \nResults \n \nAverage scores for male and female stimulus pairs in each block were calculated using the same method \nemployed in Sample 1a.  \n \n 11\nBoth male and female observers considered the unrestricted sociosexuality female composites more \nattractive than the more restricted female composites (males assessing long-term: m=3.976, t20=2.63, \np<0.05; males assessing short-term: m=3.929, t20=2.50, p<0.05; females assessing same-sex \nattractiveness: m=4.238, t20=3.49, p<0.01).  Female observers considered composites of restricted males \nto be more attractive than composites of unrestricted males for long-term relationships (m=2.952, \nt20=2.20, p<0.05) but showed no significant preference for short-term relationships (t20=0.55).  Male \nobservers also had no preference between unrestricted and restricted male composites (t20=0.04).   \n \nObservers correctly considered the unrestricted female composites as less restricted than the restricted \nfemale composite (m=3.810, t41=3.49, p<0.01), but did not differentiate significantly between the male \ncomposites in terms of sociosexuality (t41=1.69). \n \nThe male unrestricted male composites were seen as more masculine than restricted male composites \n(m=4.611, t41=6.77, p<0.001) but there were no significant differences in the perceived masculinity of \nfemale composites (t51=0.66).   \n \nThere was no significant effect of observer sex on any of the masculinity or sociosexuality ratings (all \nF<1, p>0.1).  Judgments of masculinity and attractiveness did not correlate with judgments of perceived \nsociosexuality in either male or female composites (all r<0.233, p>0.1). \n 12\nSTUDY 2 \n \nStudy 1 found evidence that observers are sensitive to cues to sociosexuality in composite facial images \u2013 \neither through explicit identification of unrestricted images (for which there is partial evidence) or, \namongst women, through aversions to unrestricted males with whom long-term relationships would be \nunsuitable \u2013 and that unrestricted male faces appear more masculine.  Study 2 built upon Study 1 in two \nkey aspects.  Firstly, despite the advantages of composites, as discussed in Study 1 above, one might \nargue that composites are too controlled when considering behavioural attributions and that observers \nmust be able to detect differences in real faces if we are to claim that they are capable of differentiating \nbetween social partners in reality.  Therefore, Study 2 was conducted using real individual faces rather \nthan composites. \n \nThe second change in Study 2 was the manner in which apparent sociosexuality was tested.  While in \nStudy 1 observers assessed each face pair once for sexual restrictedness, in Study 2 observers were asked \nto rate each individual face on four separate indices based on the SOI.  Thus, we were able to assess \nwhether observers are equally sensitive to all domains of sociosexuality, or whether for instance, \nopportunity-mediated behavioural domains emerge as easier to \u2018see\u2019 than purely attitude based questions. \n \nSTIMULI \n \n50 Durham University undergraduates (25 female; mean age=20.6\u00b11.2 years) were photographed under \nstandardized lighting, and subsequently completed the SOI questionnaire, as in Study 1.  Photographs \nwere cropped to show only the face and immediately surrounding hair and were standardized in size. \n \nSAMPLE 2A \n \n \n 13\nParticipants  \n \nThere were 17 \u2018observers\u2019 (8 female, mean age=25.0\u00b14.2 years) who were recruited by word-of-mouth \nthrough undergraduates at universities other than Durham, and who completed the study through the \ninternet.  \n \nProcedure \n \nObservers rated same sex images for attractiveness and rated all images for masculinity (the scale ran \nfrom \u2018very feminine\u2019 to \u2018very masculine\u2019 for male images, and vice versa for female images) and \nsociosexuality based on the following four questions (questions from the SOI on which these are based \nare given in parentheses): \n How many sexual partners would this person have in a given year? (Qs 1&3) \n How likely is this person to have a one night stand? (Q2)  \n How likely is this person to fantasise about someone other than their current partner? (Q4) \n How likely is this person to think sex without love is okay? (Q5) \nAll questions were responded to on scales from 1-7 and images were presented in a random order within \neach block of trials. \n \nResults \n \nThere were significant positive correlations between all perceived restrictedness (i.e. apparent SOI) \nratings and all components of the SOI scores of the photographed individuals (all rs>0.27, all p<0.07, 2-\ntailed, see Table 2 for detailed figures), with the exception of reported and rated number of sexual \npartners within the last year, neither of which correlated with any other measure (all p<0.25; see Table 2 \nfor details).  Furthermore, individuals\u2019 full SOI scores were significantly correlated with the mean rated \nSOI across all four questions (rs=0.367, p<0.05). The correlation between SOI score and mean perceived \nSOI remained significant after controlling for individual\u2019s age and sex, same-sex ratings of attractiveness,  \n 14\nand masculinity\/femininity.  Furthermore, results remained significant when male and female observers\u2019 \njudgements were analysed separately.  There was a trend for higher SOI to be associated with greater \nperceived femininity in female faces (rs=0.399, p=0.098, n=23) but no further significant correlations. \n \nSAMPLE 2B. \n \n \nParticipants \n \nFollowing the exclusion of 49 individuals who did not complete the whole test, there were 422 \n\u2018observers\u2019 (183 female, mean age=22.7\u00b13.8;) recruited through the internet from lists of online \npsychology studies. \n \nProcedure \n \nThe stimuli were divided into same sex pairs that were matched for attractiveness using attractiveness \nratings from Sample 2a (t19=1.3, p=0.2) but that differed in SOI score (t19=5.8, p<0.001).  Wherever \npossible, adjacent individuals on the attractiveness rankings were formed into a pair; where three faces \nhad the same mean attractiveness score, the two most differing in SOI score were used as a pair.  This \nresulted in a total of 10 male and 10 female face pairs. \n \nOpposite sex observers then assessed which face in each pair they would prefer for a short-term \nrelationship and for a long-term relationship using the same method as in Sample 1b.  Order of long- and \nshort-term choices was counterbalanced, and the order of pairs within blocks was randomized. Judgments \nwere averaged across all 10 pairs for each block to form long- and short-term preference scores. \n \nResults \n \nMales demonstrated significant preferences for the higher SOI female faces for both long- and short-term \nrelationships (short: t233=7.313, p<0.001; long: t233=4.591, p<0.001). By contrast, females demonstrated \n 15\nsignificant preferences for the lower SOI male faces for both types of relationship (short: t174=4.167, \np<0.001; long: t233=3.095, p<0.01).  Preference scores did not significantly differ between long and short \nterm contexts (male: t238=0.859; female: t182=1.692).  \n \nFurthermore, results remained significant when the face pairs were treated as the unit of analysis.  When \nscores were averaged together for each pair across participants, the higher SOI female faces and the lower \nSOI male faces (once a single outlier, pair 9, where women strongly preferred the higher SOI face, was \nremoved) were judged as significantly more desirable for both types of relationship (all t>2.3, all p<0.05, \ndf= 9 and 8 respectively).   \n \n 16\nDISCUSSION \n \nThese studies first sought to determine whether observers were able to identify sociosexually restricted \nversus unrestricted individuals by static facial cues alone.  The results (summarised in Table 3) suggest \nthat observers are indeed able to distinguish between individuals on the basis of sociosexuality, although \nin Sample 1a males had difficulty identifying unrestricted female composites, and in Sample 1b both \nsexes of observer had difficulty identifying unrestricted male composites.  These results combined, \ntherefore, show very strong evidence for the ability of women to identify sociosexual orientation in \nothers, particularly other women, and more limited evidence for the ability of males to make the same \njudgments.  This suggests that the accuracy of Gangestad et al\u2019s participants in judging sociosexuality \nfomr video footage may have been at least partially due to the physical appearance of the stimulus males. \n \nOur studies were also designed to investigate whether facial attractiveness and masculinity may be \nassociated with sociosexuality.  Unrestricted female composite faces were seen as more attractive than \nrestricted female composites by both sexes, suggesting that attractive women\u2019s unrestricted scores may be \nthe result of more attractive women having greater sexual opportunities and thus developing a less \nrestricted outlook.  Male preferences for unrestricted females for long-term relationships (Samples 1b and \n2b) are also surprising as one might expect that males would avoid long-term relationships with females \nwho may be more likely to be unfaithful (see e.g. Buss & Schmitt, 1993), especially where (as in Study 2) \noverall attractiveness (as judged by women) has been controlled for.  As neither the sociosexuality \nquestionnaire, nor the description of it given to the raters, explicitly include infidelity, it may be \nerroneous to assume unrestricted sociosexuality in these women was necessarily associated with greater \nlikelihood of extra-pair copulations.  Alternatively\/additionally, the selective advantage to males in \n 17\nreduced mating effort, may have been sufficient to drive a preferences for unrestrictedness in spite of any \ncosts from long term relationship breakdown. \n \n \nIn contrast to men judging female faces, women in Samples 1a and 2b consistently preferred the restricted \nmale faces.  Sample 1b, despite having no particular preference between the unrestricted and restricted \nmale composites for short-term relationships, women significantly preferred the restricted males for long-\nterm relationships (although it should be noted this difference between short- and long-term was not \nfound amongst the women rating real faces in Sample 2b).  Furthermore, these patterns of results do not \nappear to be due to differences in the inherent attractiveness of the faces (as judged by male observers); \nindeed contrary to expectation, any greater symmetry which may have existed in the real faces (which \nThornhill & Gangestad\u2019s 1994 data would predict) did not translate into greater attractiveness.  This \nsuggests that when seeking a partner, women may be attracted to males more likely to engage in long-\nterm relationships, and furthermore, that women have (as sex differences in parental investment and \npotential reproductive variance would predict) been subject to stronger selection in this regard than men \n(who have potentially more to gain from short term matings).   \n \nIn both samples 1a and 1b it was found that composites of unrestricted males were seen as more \nmasculine compared to composites of restricted males, although no correlation was found amongst the \nreal faces, which perhaps suggests the differences are subtle and may be masked in real faces by \nindividual variation.  The link between sociosexuality and perceived masculinity in male composites \ncomplements Rhodes et al\u2019s (2005) results (showing that more masculine-looking males report more \nsexual partners) and suggests that unrestricted sociosexuality may be related to increased testosterone \nlevels.  Testosterone is thought to increase facial masculinity (e.g. Verdonck, Gaethofs, Carels & de \nZegher, 1999), and may be associated with less investment in relationships, as indexed by time men spent \n 18\nwith their partner (Grey, Barrett, Lipson & Ellison, 2002).  Furthermore, men and women perceive more \nmasculine male faces as being poorer parents and possessing less of the characteristics important in a long \nterm partner (Perrett et al, 1998); this research therefore suggests such perceptions may have some \nvalidity. \n \nAmong female faces, there appeared to be no consistent link between sociosexuality and perceived \nmasculinity\/femininity, suggesting that more promiscuous behaviour in women in these samples is not \ndue to higher levels of androgens (cf Clark, 2004); indeed the data hints more at a trend in the other \ndirection such that unrestricted women might be more feminine, which would support Rhodes et al\u2019s \n(2005) findings.  It is intriguing that the three studies which have tested for relationships between putative \nmarkers for female androgens (facial masculinity: current sample and Rhodes et al; digit ratio and mental \nrotation ability: Clark) and aspects of sexual behaviour (SOI: current study and Clark; number of sexual \npartners: Rhodes et al) appear to report different patterns of results.  This may be due in part to androgens \nexerting different influences on different physical and behavioural traits depending on timing of exposure \n(i.e. in utero versus in adulthood).  Further research may offer important insights into this issue and \npotentially resolve these inconsistent findings \n \nFinally, it is important to consider that in Samples 1b and 2a, observers\u2019 perceptions of sociosexuality in \nthe faces did not relate directly to observers\u2019 perceptions of masculinity.  This suggests that although \nobservers may have some valid basis for categorising faces on the basis of sociosexuality, the apparent \nmasculinity of the faces may not necessarily drive this categorisation (despite previous findings that \nmasculinity may indeed relate to sociosexuality).  \n \nIn summary, the research presented here demonstrated the presence of static facial cues that observers can \nuse to predict other individuals' sexual attitudes and behaviours. Observers are broadly able to identify \n 19\nindividuals who are more likely to be interested in short or long term relationships. Furthermore, this \ninformation may be used by women to avoid men who are less likely to engage in a long term \nrelationship, potentially maximizing the possible benefits of women\u2019s choices for long-term partners. \n 20\nREFERENCES \n \nBailey, J.M., Kirk, K.M., Zhu, G., Dunne, M.P., & Martin, N.G.
