Two approaches to deal with the correlated measurement noises are proposed in the framework of auxiliary\nparticle filtering: with a noise augmented state vector and the second approach implements noise decorrelation.

It is essential when nodes\nperform jointly certain tasks, such as decision making,\nsensor data fusion, object tracking [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] to\nlocalize the node positions, and movement [6], [7], [8], as\nthe transmitter range is generally fairly small with respect\nto the size of the area. Other motivating applications\ninclude monitoring of large geographical areas, such as\nfor wildlife tracking [9], monitoring of buildings, produc-\ntion processes, and warehouses [7]. Apart from the change-\nable network topology, the need of communications\nbetween the nodes under limited resources (energy and\nbandwidth) and the need of processing noisy data and\novercoming losses pose additional challenges.\nThere is a great deal of methods for localization (see, e.g.,\nthe surveys [6], [7], [10], [11]) between which the range-based\n[7], [12], [13] methods are widely used. They rely on the\ndistances between nodes and are usually evaluated using\nreceived signal strengths, signal time-of-arrivals, time\ndifference of arrivals, or angle-of-arrivals, and they vary in\ntheir complexity and accuracy. The range-based techniques\ncan be divided into radio frequency (RF) ranging and acoustic\nranging. The radio frequency ranging relies on the premise\nthat bymeasuring the received signal strength, a receiver can\ndetermine its distance to a transmitter. Another class of\nranging schemes measures the time difference of arrival of\nacoustic and ultrasonic signals [12], [14].\nWhile range-based algorithms need point-to-point dis-\ntance estimation or angle estimation for positioning, range-\nfree [15] algorithms do not require this information. Another\nclassification subdivides the approaches to mobile nodes\nlocalization in wireless networks to indoor and outdoor\nenvironment [11].\nFrom the point of view of the methods employed, a\nnumber of localization techniques rely on Extended Kalman\nfilters [16], [17], Monte Carlo methods [18], [19], including\nnonparametric belief propagation [20], and on the knowl-\nedge of the connectivity between the nodes. Communica-\ntions between nodes during the localization process are\nreduced to minimum due to energy and bandwidth\nconstraints. In [21] and [22], multiple model particle\nfiltering techniques for mobility tracking of users in cellular\nnetworks are developed. A particle filter and a Rao-\nBlackwellized particle filter are presented and their perfor-\nmance is compared with an Extended Kalman filter over\nsimulated and real data from base stations. In [23], [24], an\nauxiliary multiple model particle filter (PF) is proposed for\nbearings-only tracking problems. In [23], a deterministic\nsplitting of each particle into several offsprings is per-\nformed for maneuvering target tracking, each offspring\nrepresenting a different target maneuver. In [25], an\nauxiliary PF is designed for target tracking in binary sensor\nnetworks. When the measurements are collinear, a simu-\nlated annealing approach, such as the proposed in [26], can\ncope with these ambiguities.\nMost of the aforementioned works, however, do not take\ninto account the correlation of the measurement noise which\ncan deteriorate significantly the localization accuracy.

The\nmodel of Gudmunsson consists of a decreasing autocorrela-\ntion function. The same first order autoregressive correlation\nmodel is used in [28], jointly with a Kalman filter aimed to\nestimate the correlation coefficient of the shadowing compo-\nnent of the measurements. The shadow fading correlation\nproperties are studied also in [29].\nIn our work, we propose a solution to the self-\nlocalization problem of mobile nodes by taking into account\nthe temporal correlation in the measurement noise. The\nadded values and the innovative aspects of this paper as\ncompared with previous investigations consist in the\napproach for localization of a single or several mobile\nnodes in wireless sensor networks by means of a multiple\nmodel auxiliary particle filter. Its performance is validated\non simulated and real received signal strength indicators,\nover scenarios with several nodes and a single mobile node,\nrespectively. Similarly to [27], the correlated noise is\nmodeled by a first order autoregressive model. Two\napproaches, to deal with the correlated measurement\nnoises, are proposed based on ideas inspired from the\ntracking literature. The first one augments the state vector\nwith the measurement noise, and the second approach\nimplements a noise decorrelation by introducing the so-\ncalled \u201cdifferenced measurement\u201d [30]. Two algorithms are\ndesigned and implemented in the MM AUX-PF framework.\nThe aim is to explore and compare the localization\nperformance of the proposed MM AUX-PF with and\nwithout taking into account the noise correlation.\nIn the considered formulation of the problem, node\nmobility is modeled as a linear system driven by a\ndiscrete-time command Markov process, whereas the\nmeasurement models are nonlinear and necessitate a\nreliable nonlinear estimation method. Due to the fact that\nthe control process of the mobile nodes is unknown, node\nmobility is modeled with multiple acceleration modes\n(regimes). The proposed nonlinear estimation techniques\ncan incorporate physical constraints and possibly commu-\nnications among frequently maneuvering mobile nodes in\nthe form of additional measurements.\nThe remaining part of the paper is organized as follows:\nSection 2 formulates the considered problem for localization\nof mobile nodes and describes the mobility and observation\nmodels. A multiple model auxiliary particle filter (MM\nAUX-PF) for mobile nodes self-localization is designed in\nSection 3. Performance evaluation of the proposed filter is\npresented in Section 4 over simulated and real data. Finally,\nSection 5 discusses the results and outlines open issues for\nfuture research.\n2 LOCALIZATION OF MOBILE NODES\nConsider the two-dimensional problem of simultaneous\nlocalization of n mobile nodes [7]. The vector f\u00f0x1; y1\u00de,\n\u00f0x2; y2\u00de; . . . ; \u00f0xn; yn\u00deg of positions of the mobile nodes is\nestimated given nr reference (anchor) nodes with known\ncoordinates f\u00f0xn\u00fe1; yn\u00fe1\u00de, \u00f0xn\u00fe2; yn\u00fe2\u00de; . . . ; \u00f0xn\u00fenr ; yn\u00fenr\u00deg\nand pairwise measurements fzijg, where zij is a measure-\nment between devices i and j. The reference nodes can\nobtain their coordinates in the network (through some\nexternal means such as a Global Positioning System (GPS)).\nApart from their positions, the mobile nodes estimate their\nspeeds and accelerations. This includes applications in\nwhich each sensor is equipped with a wireless transceiver\nand the distance between sensor locations is estimated by\nreceived signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements or\ntime delay of arrivals between sensor locations.\n2.1 Motion Model of the Mobile Nodes\nDifferent state mobility models are previously developed\nfor cellular wireless networks such as random walk and\npursue mobility models [31] and Singer-type models [6],\n[32], [33], [34]. Most of the models suggested in the target\ntracking literature [6], [35], [36] are also applicable for\nmobile nodes localization. In this paper, we choose a\ndiscrete-time Singer-type model [37] because it charac-\nterizes the correlated accelerations of the mobile as a time\ncorrelated process and allows for accurate prediction of the\nposition, speed, and acceleration of mobile nodes. This\nhigher order model affords decreasing the estimation error\n[6], although mobility models that do not comprise the\nacceleration can be used too.\nThe state of each moving node at time instant k is defined\nby the vector xk \u00bc \u00f0xk; _xk; \u20acxk; yk; _yk; \u20acyk\u00de0, where xk and yk\nspecify the position, _xk and _yk specify the speed, \u20acxk and \u20acyk\nare, respectively, the acceleration in x and y directions in the\ntwo-dimensional plane, and 0 denotes the transpose opera-\ntion. The motion of each mobile node can be described by\nthe following Singer model [37], [38]:\nxk \u00bc A\u00f0T; \u0002\u00dexk\u00021 \u00feBu\u00f0T \u00deuk \u00feBw\u00f0T \u00dewk; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere uk \u00bc \u00f0ux;k; uy;k\u00de0 is a discrete-time command process,\nand the respective matrices from (1) are in the form\nA\u00f0T; \u0002\u00de \u00bc ~A 03\u00033\n03\u00033 ~A\n\u0002 \u0003\n; Bi\u00f0T \u00de \u00bc\n~Bi 03\u00031\n03\u00031 ~Bi\n\u0002 \u0003\n; \u00f02\u00de\n~A \u00bc\n1 T T 2=2\n0 1 T\n0 0 \u0002\n0\n@\n1\nA; ~Bu \u00bc\nT 2=2\nT\n0\n0\n@\n1\nA; ~Bw \u00bc\nT 2=2\nT\n1\n0\n@\n1\nA: \u00f03\u00de\nThe subscript i in the matrix B\u00f0T \u00de in (2) stands for u or w,\nrespectively.

In\n[27], it is shown that\nDc \u00bc \u0002 d\u2018j;k\nln\u00f0\tD\u00de \u0005 0; \u00f08\u00de\nwhere \tD is the correlation coefficient of the shadow\nprocess between two mobile nodes separated by the\ndistance d\u2018j;k. Usually, Dc is in the range between 10 meters\nin urban environment and 500 meters in suburban\nenvironment. The value of the shadow standard deviation\n\u0003v varies dependent on the environment and in suburban\nareas is typically 8 dB [27], [28], whereas in urban\nenvironments, it is roughly 4 dB.\nThe shadow process can be modeled by a first order\nautoregressive model (AR) [27], [28]\nv\u2018j;k \u00bc av\u2018j;k\u00021 \u00fe \nk; \u00f09\u00de\nwhere \nk is a zero mean white Gaussian process with\nvariance \u00032\n \u00bc \u00f01\u0002 a2\u00de\u00032v.

These parameters\nare experimentally obtained by different authors for urban\nand suburban environment, e.g., in [27], [28], [40].\n2.4 General Motion and Observation Models\nfor Simultaneous Localization of Several\nMobile Nodes\nA combined state vectorXk \u00bc fx01;k; . . . ; x0n;k; g is composed\nand all states of the mobile nodes are simultaneously\nestimated.

An estimate of the variable of interest is\nobtained by the weighted sum of particles. Twomajor stages\ncan be distinguished: prediction and update. During predic-\ntion, each particle is modified according to the state model,\nincluding the addition of random noise in order to simulate\nthe effect of the noise on the state. In the update stage, each\nparticle\u2019s weight is reevaluated based on the new data. A\nresampling procedure introduces variety in the particles by\neliminating those with small weights and replicating the\nparticles with larger weights such that the approximation in\n(16) still holds. The residual resampling algorithm [42], [43] is\napplied here. This is a two-step process making use of\nsampling-importance-resampling scheme.\nSince the command process of the mobile nodes is\nunknown, an MM AUX-PF is designed for localization of\nthe mobile nodes. Given the set IM covering well the\npossible command values, the unknown commands are\nsupposed to evolve as a first order Markov chain with\ntransition probability matrix \u0002. The particles for the base\nstate are generated from the transition prior, according to\n(11)-(12) (where the motion model for each mobile is given\nby (1)-(3)).\n3.2 Auxiliary Multiple Model Particle Filtering for\nLocalization\nThe auxiliary Sampling Importance Resampling (SIR) PFwas\nintroduced byPitt and Shephard [44].

The auxiliary PF introduces an\nimportance function q\u00f0Xk; i\u00f0j\u00de\u00deNi\u00bc1, where i\u00f0j\u00de refers to the\nindex of the particle at k\u0002 1. The filter obtains samples from\nthe joint density p\u00f0Xk; ijZ1:k\u00de, and then, omits the index i in\nthe pair \u00f0Xk; i\u00de to produce a sample fX\u00f0i\u00dek gNi\u00bc1 from the\nmarginalizeddensityp\u00f0XkjZ1:k\u00de. The importancedensity that\ngenerates the sample fX\u00f0i\u00dek gNi\u00bc1 is defined to satisfy the\nrelation [41]\nq\u00f0Xk; ijZ1:k\u00de \/ p\n\u0005\nZkj\u0004\u00f0i\u00dek\n\u0006\np\n\u0005\nXkjX\u00f0i\u00dek\u00021\n\u0006\nw\n\u00f0i\u00de\nk\u00021; \u00f017\u00de\nwhere \u0004\n\u00f0i\u00de\nk is some characteristic of Xk given X\n\u00f0i\u00de\nk\u00021.\nThe selection of the most promising particles is carried\nout by sampling from a multinomial distribution where the\nnumber of possible outcomes is Nout.

A multiple model auxiliary PF for mobile\nnodes localization.\n3.3 Two Approaches to Deal with the Time\nCorrelated Measurement Noise\nA natural solution to overcome the problem with correlated\nmeasurement noise is to augment the mobile state xk with\nthe noise vk. Then, the localization algorithm (MM AUX-PF)\ndescribed in Section 3.2 can be applied to the whole\naugmented state vector of size n \u0006 \u00f0nx \u00fe nz\u00de (comprising the\nstate vectors of the mobile nodes and measurement noise).\nThis algorithm with the state vector augmented with the\ncorrelated noise is referred to as an MM-AUX PF with\naugmented state (AS).\nAnother decorrelation technique introduces the follow-\ning \u201cartificial measurement\u201d: \u0004zk \u00bc zk \u0002 azk\u00021. The measure-\nment equation can then be written in the form\n\u0004zk \u00bc zk \u0002 azk\u00021 \u00f025\u00de\n\u00bc h\u00f0xk\u00de \u00fe vk \u0002 a h\u00f0xk\u00021\u00de \u00fe vk\u00021\u00bd \u0004 \u00f026\u00de\n\u00bc h\u00f0xk\u00de \u0002 ah\u00f0xk\u00021\u00de \u00fe \u0004vk: \u00f027\u00de\nThe noise \u0004vk \u00bc vk \u0002 avk\u00021 in the new measurement equation\nis white but correlated with the process noise. The cross\ncorrelation between two noise sequences can be eliminated\nby a procedure, given in [35]. In most practical algorithms,\nthis cross correlation is omitted due to the little performance\ndegradation. Thus, the measurement equation in the case of\none mobile node can be modified to\n\u0004zk \u00bc \u0004h\u00f0xk\u00de \u00fe \u0004vk; \u00f028\u00de\nwhere \u0004h\u00f0xk\u00de \u00bc h\u00f0xk\u00de \u0002 ah\u00f0xk\u00021\u00de.\nThe MM-AUX PF algorithm with decorrelation is\nreferred to as with an artificial measurement (AM).\n4 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION\nTwo cases have been investigated: for urban and suburban\nenvironment. In suburban environment, the correlation\ncoefficient of the shadow process can be regarded as a\nconstant for a wide range of velocities of the mobile [28].\nTypical values of the correlation coefficient and shadow\nprocess are assumed, as suggested in the literature [27].\n4.1 Results with Simulated Data\n4.1.1 Testing Scenario 1\nA sensor deployment architecture is considered, similar to\nthe presented in [25]. Three mobile nodes are moving in an\nurban area well covered with a wireless sensor network\n(Fig. 1). Each mobile node can measure the RSSI to each of\nthe reference nodes, but only the three RSSIs with the\nhighest strength are used for localization.\nThe MM AUX-PF AS is run for estimating the augmen-\nted state vector, consisting of three individual mobile state\nvectors. Fig. 1 presents the actual and estimated trajectories\nof the three mobile nodes. The actual speed of the mobiles is\nshown in Fig. 2.\nThe parameters of the individual state vector initial\ndistribution xi;0\bN\u00f0mi;0; P i;0\u00de are selected as follows:\nP i;0 \u00bc diagfP x;0; P y;0g; P x;0 \u00bc P y;0\n\u00bc diagf30 \u00bdm\u00042; 1 \u00bdm=s\u00042; 0:5 \u00bdm=s2\u00042g; i \u00bc 1; 2; 3;\nand mi;0 contains the exact initial node states.

Thus, the number of motion modes is r \u00bc 5.\nNonrandom mobile node trajectories were generated with\nthe dynamic state equations (1)-(3) without process noise.\nThe initial state vectors are as follows: x^1;0 \u00bc \u00f0\u0002120; 7; 0; 210;\n\u000215; 0\u00de0; x^2;0 \u00bc \u00f0550; 7; 0; 150;\u000215; 0\u00de0, and x^3;0 \u00bc \u00f0\u0002630; 7; 0;\n350;\u000220; 0\u00de0. The firstmobile node performs three short-term\nmaneuvers with accelerations from the mode set and a\nlonger maneuver with a control input u \u00bc \u00f0\u00023:0; 0:0\u00de,\ndifferent from the acceleration set. The second mobile node\nmaneuvers are described by the set of accelerations. The\nthird mobile node performs two consecutive maneuvers\nwith opposing accelerations. The root-mean-square errors\n(RMSE) [30] combined on both position coordinates yield the\nestimated state parameters to the actual dynamic parameters\nof each mobile node over Nmc \u00bc 50 Monte Carlo runs. The\nposition and speed RMSEs of the MM AUX-PF with\naugmented state are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. High position\nand speed estimates are achieved, with accuracy less than\n45 m with respect to the mobile nodes position.\n4.1.2 Testing Scenario 2\nIn this example, we perform a comparison between the\ndeveloped MM AUX-PF with an augmented state vector\nand MM AUX-PF AM for dealing with the measurement\ntime correlation and an MM AUX-PF without accounting\nfor the measurement correlation. The estimated and actual\ntrajectories are given in Fig. 5.

The MM AUX-PF AS has shown more\naccurate performance than the MM AUX-PF AM.\n4.2 Results with Real Data\nThe performance of the proposed localization MM-AUX-PF\nalgorithms, with AS and AM, respectively, has been\ninvestigated over a cellular wireless network, with real\nRSSIs, collected from BSs in Glasgow, United Kingdom. The\nmobile station was a vehicle driving in the city center. More\nthan 400 BSs are available in the area where the car was\nmoving. However, only data from the six with the highest\nRSSIs were provided to the localization algorithm. Also, a\nGPS system collected the actual positions of the moving\nmobile, for the purposes of validating the performance of the\ndeveloped algorithms. Fig. 12 presents the map of the urban\nenvironment, with the nearest base stations and the\ntrajectory of the car (shown increased in size in Fig. 13).\nThe vehicle trajectory contains both patterns with sharp\nmaneuvers and rectilinear motion, including a stretch at the\nend where the vehicle is parked. Additional information for\nthe road is included as position constraints in the algorithms.\nApart from the signal strengths, a GPS system collected\nthe actual positions of the mobile unit. All parameters for\nthe filters (tested with the real data) are the same as the\nparameters given in Table 1, except for the sampling\nperiod T \u00bc 0:5 s, Vmax \u00bc 25 m\/sec, sample size Tm \u00bc 800,\n\u0003x \u00bc \u00bd30; 1; 0:3; 30; 1; 0:3\u00040, and \u0003v \u00bc 5:5 dB. The transition\nprobability matrix \u0002 has the same form as in Section 4.1.\nFig. 14 shows the actual trajectory of the mobile together\nwith the estimated trajectories, and Fig. 15 gives the\nrespective position RMSEs. With the real RSSIs, we\ncompared the performance of: 1) the MM AUX-PF that\ndoes not take into account the temporal measurement\nnoise correlation with the MM AUX-PF with AM and MM\nAUX-PF with AS. From both Figs. 14 and 15, it is evident\nthat the accuracy of the MM AUX-PF with AS and the\nMM-AUX PF with AM is higher than the accuracy of the\nMM AUX-PF neglecting the temporal noise correlation.\nThe estimated trajectory obtained with the MM AUX-\nPF accounting for the noise correlation is more accurate\nthan the MM AUX-PF estimate without taking into\naccount this correlation.\nThe computational complexity is another important issue\nthat we investigated. The MM AUX-PF execution time\nincreases with the number of maneuvering models used in\nMIHAYLOVA ET AL.: LOCALIZATION OF MOBILE NODES IN WIRELESS NETWORKS WITH CORRELATED IN TIME MEASUREMENT NOISE 51\nFig. 12.

The ratio between the computational\ntime of the MM AUX-PF with five models and the\ncomputational time of the conventional AUX-PF is approxi-\nmately 3:1. In the framework of the MATLAB environment,\none-step processing time of a mobile node is approximately\n2 seconds on a conventional PC (AMD Athlon(tm) 64\nProcessor 1.81 GHz). By using C++ programming tools, the\ncomputational time is reduced to the sampling interval. In\nMATLAB environment with a nonoptimized code, the\nexecution time for the MM-AUX PF with AS and AM is 2.33\nand 2.38 s, respectively.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper contributes to solving the problem of simulta-\nneous localization of mobile nodes in wireless networks\nwith correlated in time measurement noises. Two MM\nauxiliary particle filters (with an augmented state vector\nand an artificial measurement, respectively) are proposed\nfor simultaneous localization of a mobile nodes in wireless\nnetworks. The algorithms performance has been investi-\ngated and validated over different scenarios and has shown\nhigh accuracy for localizing maneuvering nodes.\nThe developed techniques have the potential to be used\nin different applications, such as GPS-free position localiza-\ntion of mobile nodes in wireless networks, for localization of\nmoving vehicles and robots. The algorithms proposed here\ncan be useful also in scenarios where the location informa-\ntion for the mobile nodes is supporting basic network\nfunctions.\nFuture work will be focused on localization when both\nfixed and mobile nodes communicate with each other, on\ntechniques for localizing of a large number of nodes and\nconnectivity issues.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors are thankful for the anonymous reviewers\nhelping them to improve this paper.
