More joined-up, partnership approaches supported by information and communications\ntechnologies (ICTs) have become key to managing these demands. This article discusses recent developments towards integrated care\nin the context of one of the arenas in which integration is being attempted, the Single Assessment Process (SAP) to support the care\nfor older people in England. It draws upon accounts of local SAP implementations in order to assess and reflect upon some of the\nsuccesses and limitations of service integration enabled by ICTs.\nDescription of care practice: At the Department of Health in England, policy and strategy are directed at the integration of services\nthrough a \u2018whole systems\u2019 approach, with services that are interdependent upon one another and organised around the person that\nuses them. The Single Assessment Processes (SAP) is an instance of inter-organisational and cross-sectoral sharing of information\nintended to improve communication and coordination amongst professions and agencies and so support more integrated care. The\naim of SAP is to ensure that older people receive appropriate, effective and timely responses to their health and social care needs\nand that professionals do not duplicate each others efforts. This article examines examples from two programmes of work within the\ncontext of SAP in England: one with the direction coming from local government social services, the other where the momentum is\ncoming from the National Health Service (NHS).\nConclusion and discussion: Both examples show that the policy and practice of ICT-supported integration continues to represent a\nsignificant challenge. Although the notion of integrated care underpinned by ICT-enabled information sharing is persuasive, it has\nlimitations in practice. The notion of an \u2018open systems\u2019 approach is proposed as an alternative way of improving communication and\ncoordination across the domains of health and social care.<\/dc:description><dc:description>Full-text of this article is available at http:\/\/www.ijic.org\/publish\/articles\/000288\/article.pdf<\/dc:description><dc:publisher>Igitur, Utrecht Publishing & Archiving Services<\/dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-12-10T13:34:22Z<\/dc:date><dc:type>Article<\/dc:type><dc:identifier>International journal of integrated care, 2007, vol. 7, no.
