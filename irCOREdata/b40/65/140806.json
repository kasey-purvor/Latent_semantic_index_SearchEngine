INTRODUCTION \nNatural turf sports field surfaces are used extensively for winter sports such as \nfootball and rugby. The mechanical behaviour of these surfaces is important for both \nthe prevention of injuries and to aid athlete performance. Dissipation of impacting \nenergy and reduction of loads returned to athletes is regarded as important to prevent \ninjuries [1], while stiffness and energy return from sports surfaces allows athletes to \nperform athletic movements more efficiently [2].  \nUnderstanding of athlete loading of natural turf surfaces requires further research [3], \nto determine how these surfaces provide impact absorption and how they behave \nduring and following unloading in terms of energy return and surface wear. \nQuantifying the mechanical response of natural turf surfaces to impact is complicated \nby stress-strain behaviour being dependent upon the magnitude and loading rate of the \nstress applied [3]. The ability of mechanical devices to replicate the forces, stresses \nand loading rates of athletes is therefore vital to understand the behaviour of this \nsurface type in the human sport context.  \nPrevious research has identified a lack of sports surface testing devices that replicate \nloading and boundary conditions of athlete-surface interaction [1, 4, 5], with fewer \ndevices suitable for use on natural turf than synthetic turf sports surfaces.  Vertical \nimpact loading of athletes is replicated by the Artificial Athlete Berlin (and similar \ndevices) but testing of natural turf surfaces with these devices has not been reported in \nthe literature reviewed, although the Artificial Athlete Berlin has been used in \nbenchmarking natural turf in the development of synthetic turf.  This could be due to \nthe availability of such devices for natural turf research or issues related to large \nplastic deformations in natural turf [3] which are not experienced in the testing of \nFinal draft of paper published as: Caple, James, Bartlett, Bartlett (2011). Proc. IMechE Part P: J Sports Eng and \nTech, 225:103-109. doi:10.1177\/1754337111399218 \nelastomeric or synthetic turf surfaces.  The Clegg Impact Soil Tester (CIST) is the \nmost commonly used vertical impact device for natural turf sports field surfaces, and \nquantifies peak deceleration of a falling mass onto the surface under performance \nquality standards [6]. While it is lightweight and portable, the device does not \nrepresent contact times, rate of loading or peak forces of athletes [5]. The lack of \nbiomechanically valid, vertical impact devices specifically for use in-situ on natural \nturf has restricted comparisons between artificial and natural turf sports field surfaces. \nTo address these issues, a mechanical vertical testing device was developed to \ninvestigate the effects of dynamic impact stresses simulated on natural turf surfaces.   \n \n2. METHODOLOGY \n2.1 The Dynamic Surface Tester Device \n2.1.1 Design and Operation \nThe Dynamic Surface Tester (DST) device consists of a compressed-air driven ram \n(VG040\/0100 Numatics Inc., Skelmersdale, UK) of 100 mm stroke length that \nimpacts a studded cylindrical test foot vertically onto the surface. Pressure-controlled \ntesting is created with the pneumatic system, allowing ram pressure to be adjustable \n(0.2-0.7 MPa) to vary the velocity (1.10-1.34 m s\n-1\n) and force (0.26-0.82 kN) of the \ntest foot upon impact. The test foot is an aluminium cylinder (41 mm diameter, 38 \nmm height, 1320 mm\n2 \nsurface area), which allows a single stud to be positioned in the \ncentre of the foot.  The stud is interchangeable, with a British Standard 15 mm length \naluminium rugby stud [7] selected for this research due to its low wear characteristics.  \nFinal draft of paper published as: Caple, James, Bartlett, Bartlett (2011). Proc. IMechE Part P: J Sports Eng and \nTech, 225:103-109. doi:10.1177\/1754337111399218 \nSoil water content (volumetric) is recorded as a first stage measurement using an \nimpedance sensor (ML2x, Delta-T Devices Ltd., Cambridge, UK). At rest the foot is \npositioned 35 mm above the surface (Figure 1a), and passes through an aperture in a \nsteel base plate during operation, causing a direct impact with the surface. The test \nfoot continues to penetrate into the surface until the ground reaction force is equal to \nthe impacting force of the test foot, at which point the device stops moving (Figure \n1b).  Maximum surface penetration is limited to 46 mm by ram stroke length. The \nfoot retracts to its original position (Figure 1a) at the end of each test. Data collected \nwith the DST is stored on a logger and transferred to a PC for processing through a \nnumerical computing script (MatLab 7.1, Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). The device \nand air cylinder fit onto a sack-barrow to allow for portability.  \nAn Entran ELHS force transducer (Entran, Lexington, KY., USA) measures the force \nacting on the test foot (1 kN range, 0.5 % combined non-linearity and hysteresis), and \na linear encoder (rack and pinion single turn 20 k\u03a9 potentiometer; precision \u00b1 0.2 \nmm) measures positional data during impact and penetration, at a frequency of 533 \nHz. Time measurements are based on a crystal-controlled 10 ms timing pulse from the \ndata logger controller. Impact speed is calculated by the maximum change in distance \nbetween two time points (1.875 ms) before impact with the surface.  \nTotal energy absorption of the surface is determined by calculating the integral of the \nwork done by the test foot during penetration (W) during each timestep (Equation 1).  \n \n\uf0f2\uf03d\nmax\n0\nz\ndzFW                                                                                                       (1) \n \nFinal draft of paper published as: Caple, James, Bartlett, Bartlett (2011). Proc. IMechE Part P: J Sports Eng and \nTech, 225:103-109. doi:10.1177\/1754337111399218 \nWhere zmax is the maximum depth of penetration, F is the ground reaction force \nacting on the test foot, and dz is the vertical displacement interval in each logging \ncycle.  \nLoading rate in the first 50 milliseconds of impact (dFz50, kN s\n-1\n) is calculated by:  \n \n50\nF\ndFz50\n\uf044\n\uf03d                                                                                                            (2) \n \nWhere \u0394F is the difference in force between t = 50 ms and t = 0 ms (i.e. initial \nimpact). \n \n2.1.2 Biomechanical Validation \nThe DST device was developed to simulate the peak vertical dynamic stress of the \nloading phase during athlete foot-surface contact when running (Figure 2). Previous \nresearch [8, 9] showed that when subjects ran on natural turf surfaces in a laboratory \nat 3.83 m s\n-1\n, they had a mean external boot contact area of 3800 mm\n2\n, exerting a \nmean peak vertical force of 2.12 kN (B, Figure 2) and vertical stress of 0.56 MPa \nduring foot contact. This value of mean stress is replicated by the smaller footprint \n(1320 mm\n2\n) of the DST device using an impacting force of 0.74 kN.  \nThe aluminium test foot on the device was selected to increase durability during use, \nand therefore repeatability in surface testing, instead of selection of boot-specific \nmaterials. The effect of the stud on the test foot during impact is considered minimal \nin terms of decelerating the test foot on soft surfaces, but may be used as an indicator \nof reduced comfort for athletes on harder surfaces where complete stud penetration is \nFinal draft of paper published as: Caple, James, Bartlett, Bartlett (2011).

The range of impact velocities provided by the device (1.10-1.34 m s\n-1\n) \nis comparable to vertical touchdown velocities (1.10 m s\n-1\n) recorded when athletes ran \nat 4 m s\n-1\n [10].  \n \n2.2 Soil Characterisation and Experimental Design \nValidation experiments were performed with the DST in the Soil Dynamics \nLaboratory at Cranfield University. The soil used was a sandy loam texture (66 % \nsand, 17 % silt, 17 % clay), as per [11]. Integrated excavation and consolidation \nmachinery which provide uniform soil conditions [12, 13] were used to prepare four \ndifferent soil only (no grass, no organic matter) treatments. The variation in the soil \ntreatments was created by manipulating soil dry bulk density and water content, and \nquantified using core sampling for dry density [14] and a soil water content \nimpedance probe (type ML2x, Delta-T Devices Ltd., Cambridge, UK) respectively. \nThe deceleration (multiples of the acceleration due to gravity, g) of a 2.25 kg CIST, \n(SD Instrumentation Ltd., Bath, UK), dropped three times from 0.45 m vertically onto \nthe test surface, was used to determine soil hardness in each treatment (Table 1). \nUndrained soil shear strength (Cu) was measured with a 19 mm shear vane (Pilcon \nDR 2149 Pilcon Engineering Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) and reported as per [15]. \nEach treatment was split into six plots of size 400 mm x 2200 mm and a randomised \nblock design was used. Three replications of soil dry bulk density, volumetric \nmoisture content and rebound hardness were collected per plot (n = 18), with five \nreplications of DST impacts performed per plot (n = 30). The operating pressure on \nthe DST device was set at 0.6 MPa, resulting in an impact force of 0.79 kN \u00b1 0.03 \nFinal draft of paper published as: Caple, James, Bartlett, Bartlett (2011). Proc.

Pearson correlation coefficient analysis \nwas performed to assess linear relationships on mean treatment data of the soil \ncharacterising variables (Table 1) and the DST impact variables.  All statistical \nanalysis was performed using Statistica 9 (Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, OK., USA). \n \n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nMean force-time histories for DST impact in each treatment are illustrated in Figure 3. \nLower dry density soil treatments (3 and 4) took longer to bring the DST test foot to \nrest, and exhibited greater force readings than the harder dry density treatments at end \nof penetration.  This suggests that there is a time-dependence in the generation of \nforce through the pneumatic system. \nSignificant differences (p<0.05) were found among the soil treatments for penetration \ndistance, penetration time, surface energy absorption data and loading rate (Figure 4). \nThe more loosely packed, lower density soil treatments (Treatments 3 and 4) allowed \nsignificantly greater penetration distance (Figure 4a), penetration time (Figure 4b) and \nsurface energy absorption (Figure 4c) due to lower shear strength of the soil (Table 1).  \nThis is due to an increase in soil shear strength and resilient modulus with soil dry \ndensity [3, 17, 18].  Shear strength (Cu) was linearly correlated with these parameters \n(r = -0.93 to -0.97; Table 2).  Soil hardness as measured by the CIST was also linearly \nFinal draft of paper published as: Caple, James, Bartlett, Bartlett (2011). Proc. IMechE Part P: J Sports Eng and \nTech, 225:103-109. doi:10.1177\/1754337111399218 \ncorrelated with these parameters (r = -0.85 to -0.98; Table 2) and with shear strength \n(Cu, r = 0.93; Table 2). \nThese initial data support the potential of the device as a tool to assess dynamic \nstrength of natural surfaces. Data from in-situ surfaces is required for further \nvalidation of the device, and will allow assessment of a variety of physical surface \nconditions, including the effects of turfgrass. Strong correlation coefficients between \npenetration distance, penetration time and energy absorption are expected due to the \ninter-dependency of these parameters.  \nRate of loading was only significantly greater in Treatment 2 (p<0.05). Rate of \nloading is an important variable for assessing sports surfaces for athlete interaction \n[16], and is not currently performed by other mechanical devices. Although described \nas dynamic, the data from these initial experiments indicate the DST device loaded \nthe surface 7 times more slowly than subjects in the previous study [8] (10.3 kN s\n-1\n \ncompared to 75.8 kN s\n-1\n), and this aspect will be considered further in future work. \nThe DST can be considered a simplification of athlete-surface interaction by the \nadoption of mean contact area to produce stress data, and modelling vertical aspects \nonly. However, it provides a further step towards understanding player-surface \ninteraction on natural turf due to the lack of biomechanically valid vertical impact \ndevices evident for use in-situ on this surface type.     \nReplicating the dynamic stress an athlete imparts onto a surface, through the \ndevelopment of a mechanical device, allows increased understanding of surface \nbehaviour in response to athlete impacts (e.g. surface deformation), and the extent of \nthe energy absorption an athlete may receive. The stud on the test foot allows stud\/test \nfoot penetration ratios to be investigated, and replicates more closely the boundary \nconditions of athlete-surface impacts [19]. The function of the DST device measures \nFinal draft of paper published as: Caple, James, Bartlett, Bartlett (2011). Proc. IMechE Part P: J Sports Eng and \nTech, 225:103-109. doi:10.1177\/1754337111399218 \nmaximum surface deformation when loaded, important for energy dissipation when \nathletes impact the surface. The behaviour of the surface during unloading is not \ndetermined with the current device configuration but should also be considered, as \nviscous and elastic properties are important for surface durability and player \nperformance [3].  \nThe non-linear stress-strain behaviour of sports surfaces requires new testing devices \nto possess the ability to vary the impacting forces and stresses imparted onto the \nsurface [5]. The DST device possesses this capability in terms of variable ram \npressure and interchangeable test feet and studs of different dimensions, and future \nresearch will be directed towards assessing surface behaviour to a range of vertical \nstresses which replicate a range of athlete masses or biomechanical movements. \n \n4. IMPLICATIONS \nA new variable-force dynamic testing device for use on natural turf surfaces has been \ndeveloped, which replicates the vertical stress of an athlete when running. This device \ncan be used to increase understanding of the behaviour of sports surfaces under \nathlete loading and the energy dissipation athletes encounter.  \n \n5.
