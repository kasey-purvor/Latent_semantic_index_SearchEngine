Left untreated, \nchlamydia can cause epididymitis and urethritis \nin men, and cervicitis and urethritis in women, \nas well as potentially creating future fertility \nproblems for women (e.g. ectopic pregnancy, pelvic \ninflammatory disease and tubal infertility). Yet, \n50% of infected men and 70% of infected women \ndo not experience symptoms of the infection.\nThroughout the UK, testing for chlamydia involves \nthe use of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). \nThese tests are very accurate, but are laboratory \ndependent, creating a delay between testing and \nreceipt of diagnosis, caused by the time it takes \nto transport the test sample to the laboratory and \nprocess the result. This delay is problematic, as \na number of infected patients will not return for \ntreatment, following their positive diagnosis.\nPoint-of-care testing methods can provide results \nwithin hours after the tests are carried out, \nwhich could allow infected patients to be treated \nimmediately, as well as allowing the immediate \nidentification of recent sexual partners who should \nalso be tested. Currently, point-of-care methods \nare not recommended for use in the NHS because \nthey are less accurate than methods used in current \npractice, but if new point-of-care tests reported \nimproved accuracy or increased the uptake of \ntesting, they could potentially become an effective \nalternative to laboratory testing. The Chlamydia \nRapid Test (CRT) is a point-of-care test that has \nreported improved accuracy.\nObjectives\nThe objective of this review was to assess whether \nor not the CRT could improve detection of genital \nchlamydia, and whether it is more effective than \ncurrent practice using NAATs, in terms of the \nnumber of cases of chlamydia that are detected and \ntreated, and the proportion of partners identified \nand treated.\nThis review also sought to establish the incremental \ncost-effectiveness of the CRT (compared with \ncurrent practice), and patients\u2019 own preferences for \nchlamydia testing services.\nMethods\nElectronic searches were undertaken to identify \npublished and unpublished reports. Electronic \ndatabases searched included MEDLINE, EMBASE, \nBIOSIS and CENTRAL. The most recent search \nwas conducted in November 2008. The types of \nstudies considered were randomised controlled \ntrials (RCTs) for the reviews of diagnostic accuracy \nand effectiveness, direct head-to-head studies \nfor the review of diagnostic accuracy, and non-\nrandomised comparative studies if there was an \ninsufficient number of RCTs identified for the \nreview of effectiveness. Participants were sexually \nactive adolescent and adult women and men, \nsuspected of having or being tested for genital \nchlamydia infection. The tests considered were \nthe CRT and other comparator point-of-care tests \nidentified, using a NAAT as a reference standard.\nOne reviewer screened the titles and abstracts \nof all reports identified by the search strategy. \nTwo reviewers independently assessed all full-\ntext reports of potentially relevant studies. One \nreviewer extracted data from the included full-text \nstudies, which were checked by the second reviewer. \nFor the diagnostic accuracy review, two reviewers \nindependently assessed the quality of all included \nstudies using a modified version of the QUADAS \n(Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy \nStudies) instrument. For the effectiveness review, \nmodified checklists adapted from Verhagen and \ncolleagues (1998) were to be used for RCTs and \nnon-randomised studies.\nThe results of the individual studies were tabulated, \nand sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative \nlikelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratios \n(DORs) calculated. Hierarchical summary receiver \noperating characteristic (HSROC) curves were \nproduced for each test where sufficient data for \nanalysis were reported. Meta-analysis models were \nfitted using HSROC models. Summary sensitivity, \nspecificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, \nand DORs for each model were reported as a \nmedian and a 95% confidence interval (CI). For Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 29 (Executive summary)\nstudies reporting effectiveness outcomes, meta-\nanalysis was to be used to estimate a summary \nmeasure of effect, with dichotomous outcome data \ncombined using relative risk using a fixed effect \nmodel in the absence of statistical heterogeneity.\nA review of the preferences of patients was also \nconducted and was confined to studies that had \nreported willingness to pay or reported preferences \nbetween different relevant screening test regimens. \nOnly economic measures of preference based on \npopulation values were considered, as such data \nwould be most useful for priority setting. Only \ntwo studies were identified. A discrete choice \nexperiment suggested that family planning clinics \nwere preferred as a facility for screening, and less \ninvasive techniques were favoured.\nFor cost-effectiveness analysis, a simple decision \nmodel was used to show that patients attend \ndifferent screening facilities and are faced with \nthe choice of accepting or not accepting the \ntest offer and providing the sample for the test. \nMost who attend accept the offer, and a small \nproportion of those who do attend would not be \nable to provide the sample required and remain \nunscreened. The prevalence rate has been used to \ndetermine the proportion of those tested who are \nexpected to have chlamydia. The sensitivity and \nspecificity of the tests that are being compared \nidentify the proportion of the patients correctly or \nincorrectly identified in the model. It is assumed \nthat a significant proportion of positive cases \nand their partners are treated. Effectiveness was \nmeasured in terms of the absolute numbers of true-\npositives, false-positives, false-negatives (and other \npositive cases missed) and true-negatives detected. \nCosts were considered from the health service\u2019s \nperspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios \nwere used to examine the relative cost-effectiveness, \nand values of the major parameters of the models \nwere varied in a sensitivity analysis.\nResults\nThirteen studies enrolling 8817 participants were \nincluded in the analysis. In the pooled estimates \nfor the CRT, two studies compared five separate \nsets of vaginal swab specimens, and a further two \nstudies compared four sets of first void urine (FVU) \nspecimens. The sensitivity (95% CI) of the CRT was \n80% (73% to 85%) for vaginal swab specimens and \n77% (59% to 89%) for FVU specimens. Specificity \nwas 99% (99% to 100%) for vaginal swab specimens \nand 99% (98% to 99%) for FVU specimens.\nIn the pooled estimates for a comparator point-\nof-care test (Clearview Chlamydia), four studies \ncompared eight separate sets of vaginal, cervical \nand urethral specimens. For cervical specimens \nalone, there were four sets of specimens from the \nfour studies. The sensitivity (95% CI) was 52% (39% \nto 65%) for vaginal, cervical and urethral swab \nspecimens combined, and 64% (47% to 77%) for \ncervical specimens alone. Specificity was 97% (94% \nto 100%) for vaginal, cervical and urethral swab \nspecimens combined, and 97% (88% to 99%) for \ncervical specimens alone.\nNo studies were identified comparing non-\ndiagnostic clinical effectiveness outcomes for point-\nof-care tests compared with NAATs, for example \nthe number of cases detected and treated, and the \nnumber of partners contacted and treated.\nThe results of the economic evaluation showed that \nfor a hypothetical cohort of 1000 people, using \nthe current practice of polymerase chain reaction \ntesting would result in 12.63 people who were \noffered testing being correctly treated and having \ntheir sexual partners contacted, at a cost of \u00a37070 \n(for the whole cohort). For the CRT, the number \nbeing correctly treated would be 10.98, at a cost \nof \u00a37180. For the Clearview Chlamydia test, the \nnumber correctly treated would be 7.14, at a cost of \n\u00a37170. Both point-of-care tests were therefore more \ncostly and less effective than current practice.\nAn increase in uptake rates, improvement in \ndiagnostic performance and reductions in cost \nwould all potentially make the CRT worthwhile, \nbut it is unclear whether changes of sufficient \nmagnitude are feasible.\nPatient preferences indicated that those being \ntested preferred for treatment to be provided in \na family planning clinic setting, preferred less \ninvasive methods of specimen collection (e.g. FVU), \nand preferred having a trained health-care advisor \npresent for support. If services accommodate these \npreferences as far as possible, there is potentially \nan opportunity to increase uptake rates for testing.\nDiscussion\nThere was insufficient evidence to suggest that the \nCRT could improve detection of genital chlamydia \ninfection compared with current practice, as there \nwere insufficient comparisons available to allow \nrobust conclusions to be drawn from the analysis. \nIn addition, as no comparative studies were Executive summary: Rapid point-of-care tests for the detection of genital chlamydia infection\nidentified reporting non-diagnostic outcomes, it \nwas not possible to conduct the review of clinical \neffectiveness to determine whether the CRT \ncould detect and treat more people than methods \ncurrently in use. Current practice was found to \nbe less costly and more effective, although there \nwere circumstances under which point-of-care \ntesting could become a viable alternative (i.e. \nif uptake rates for testing were increased using \nthis point-of-care method). Patients\u2019 preferences \nfor the provision of chlamydia services favoured \nnon-invasive testing methods, provided in a \nfamily planning setting. Robust evidence on \npatient preferences for point-of-care testing was \nnot available, although where reported in the \ndiagnostic accuracy studies, participants found \nthese tests to be very acceptable.\nConclusions\nThe limited evidence available suggests that \nNAATs are still the most accurate and cost-effective \nmethod for diagnosing chlamydia infection. There \nmay be circumstances in which point-of-care tests \ncould be provided in addition to existing NAAT \nservices (e.g. where this might increase uptake rates \nor reduce non-return rates for treatment), but there \nis currently little evidence on point-of-care methods \nin such settings. Research on this would be useful, \nalong with research on the acceptability of point-\nof-care testing. Robust evidence of the diagnostic \naccuracy of point-of-care tests for different types \nof samples is also still required, as are studies \ncomparing clinical effectiveness outcomes for these \ntests in comparison with NAATs.\nPublication\nHislop J, Quayyum Z, Flett G, Boachie C, Fraser \nC, Mowatt G.

It produces high-quality research information on the \neffectiveness, costs and broader impact of health technologies for those who use, manage and provide care \nin the NHS. \u2018Health technologies\u2019 are broadly defined as all interventions used to promote health, prevent \nand treat disease, and improve rehabilitation and long-term care.\nThe research findings from the HTA programme directly influence decision-making bodies such as the \nNational Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the National Screening Committee \n(NSC). HTA findings also help to improve the quality of clinical practice in the NHS indirectly in that they \nform a key component of the \u2018National Knowledge Service\u2019.\nThe HTA programme is needs led in that it fills gaps in the evidence needed by the NHS. There are three \nroutes to the start of projects.\nFirst is the commissioned route. Suggestions for research are actively sought from people working in the \nNHS, from the public and consumer groups and from professional bodies such as royal colleges and NHS \ntrusts. These suggestions are carefully prioritised by panels of independent experts (including NHS service \nusers). The HTA programme then commissions the research by competitive tender.\nSecond, the HTA programme provides grants for clinical trials for researchers who identify research \nquestions. These are assessed for importance to patients and the NHS, and scientific rigour.\nThird, through its Technology Assessment Report (TAR) call-off contract, the HTA programme \ncommissions bespoke reports, principally for NICE, but also for other policy-makers. TARs bring together \nevidence on the value of specific technologies.\nSome HTA research projects, including TARs, may take only months, others need several years. They \ncan cost from as little as \u00a340,000 to over \u00a31 million, and may involve synthesising existing evidence, \nundertaking a trial, or other research collecting new data to answer a research problem.\nThe final reports from HTA projects are peer reviewed by a number of independent expert referees before \npublication in the widely read journal series Health Technology Assessment.\nCriteria for inclusion in the HTA journal series\nReports are published in the HTA journal series if (1) they have resulted from work for the HTA \nprogramme, and (2) they are of a sufficiently high scientific quality as assessed by the referees and \neditors.\nReviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed \u2018systematic\u2019 when the account of the search, appraisal \nand synthesis methods (to minimise biases and random errors) would, in theory, permit the replication \nof the review by others.\nThe research reported in this issue of the journal was commissioned by the HTA programme as project \nnumber 08\/54\/01. The contractual start date was in December 2008. The draft report began editorial \nreview in April 2009 and was accepted for publication in August 2009.
