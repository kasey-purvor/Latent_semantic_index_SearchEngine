Little is known about \nfactors influencing older people\u2019s decisions about participating in clinical trials. \n \nObjectives \n \nTo examine the views of older people about participating in clinical trials. \n \nMethods \n \nPostal questionnaire to 801 participants who had completed the MAVIS nutrition \ntrial, aged 65yrs and older. Closed and open questions sought participants\u2019 views \nabout factors important to them when deciding to take part in a trial, features of the \nMAVIS trial they liked and disliked and changes they would suggest. \n \nResults \n \n540 (59% of MAVIS trial participants) returned the questionnaire. The most \nimportant reasons reported for taking part in the trial were helping the research team \nand medical knowledge, and helping other older people. Participants valued good \ncommunication with the trial staff and good organisation. Participants reported \nconcerns about swallowing pills and taking a placebo. Participants reported that \nfuture participation in trials could be influenced by poor health status.   \n 4 \n \nLimitations \n \nThis questionnaire surveyed older participants who had taken part in a randomised \ncontrolled trial. It did not elicit the views of people who had withdrawn or never \ndecided to take part in the trial. \n \nConclusions \n \nOlder people report altruistic reasons for taking part in trials.  Simple trial designs, \nwhich minimise demands on participants and maintain good communications \nshould be preferred. Explaining the need for older people, despite poor health, to \nparticipate in trials may help the generalisability of clinical trials. \n \nKey words: randomised controlled trial, patient participation, older people, nutrition \n \nRunning heading: including older people in trials \n \nTrial Registration Number:  ISRCTN 66376460 \n \n \n \n \n \n 5 \nBACKGROUND \n \nThe randomised controlled trial (RCT) is widely accepted as the most powerful \nmethod to evaluate the effectiveness of new health technologies. However, low \naccrual and retention of participants can restrict the value of the trial, reducing the \nstatistical power and generalisability [1,2]. A recent review reported that 31% of trials \nfunded by the UK Medical Research Council and National Health Service Research \nand Development Health Technology Assessment Programme that recruited \nparticipants between 1994 and 2002 did not achieve their original recruitment target \n[3]. Older people, in particular, are less likely to be included in RCTs, restricting \ngeneralisability further [4].    \n \nStudies which have examined factors influencing trial recruitment have often \nfocussed on cancer trials [1,2,5,6] or hypothetical trials [7]. Trial recruitment is \ninfluenced by clinician and patient factors.  Clinician barriers identified [1,2,5] \ninclude time pressures and constraints, lack of staff and training, concern about the \nimpact on the clinician-patient relationship, concern for the patients, loss of \nprofessional autonomy, and lack of reward and recognition. Barriers to participant \naccrual and factors influencing participation in RCTs include the extra demands of \nthe study (e.g. additional procedures and appointments), patient treatment \npreferences and treatment uncertainty [1,2,5]. Factors affecting older people\u2019s views \non taking part in RCTs have seldom been examined. \n \nThe aim of this study was to explore the factors that influence older people to take \npart and remain in randomised trials through surveying participants who had \ncompleted a randomised controlled trial investigating the effect of multimineral and \n 6 \nmultivitamin supplements on infections, known as the Mineral And Vitamin \nIntervention Study (MAVIS trial) [8]. \n 7 \nMETHODS \n \nThe MAVIS trial design \n \nThe MAVIS trial was a randomised, double blinded placebo-controlled trial which \ninvestigated the effect of a multimineral and multivitamin supplement on infections, \nhealth service use and quality of life in 910 community-dwelling people aged 65yrs \nand older in the Grampian region of Scotland. Full details of the trial are provided \nelsewhere [8]. Grampian Research Ethics Committee gave approval for the study. All \nolder people covered by the general practices involved were eligible to take part, \nunless their general practitioners (GPs) had indicated that they were too unwell to be \ncontacted, or they already took vitamin or mineral supplements.  Eligible older \npeople were recruited by mailing them an initial invitation from their GP. Those who \nindicated they were interested returned a reply by post and were invited to an \nappointment in the GP\u2019s surgery. \n \nParticipants were asked to take one tablet a day for one year. They were also asked to \nrecord daily in a diary whether they had an infection and any contact with primary \ncare for infection. At the end of each month participants returned the diary by post to \nthe trial office, together with a questionnaire about trial tablet consumption over the \nlast seven days. Ten percent of participants were also randomly selected to take part \nin a tablet count at six months and one year, requiring them to return unused tablets \nat these time points. Questionnaires for the Euroqol (EQ-5D) [9] and Short-Form-12 \n(SF-12) [10] were completed at the GP visit and sent out at six months and one year.  \n \n 8 \nParticipants also completed digit span forwards [11] and verbal fluency [12] \ncognitive function tests at recruitment, and then by phone at one year. Two \nresearchers were involved in recruitment (a research nurse and a research dietitian). \nBoth researchers conducted the subsequent cognitive function tests by phone. \nParticipants were also phoned shortly after recruitment to check that there were no \nconcerns about the study. The two researchers or trial secretary also phoned \nparticipants if diaries or questionnaires were not returned after one postal reminder, \nor if there were queries about information provided in the diaries. \n \nAfter the end of the trial all participants who had not withdrawn or indicated they \nwished no follow-up were given details of their trial allocation and the results of the \ntrial by post (801 of the 910 randomised). They were then sent this reply-paid follow-\nup questionnaire by post, which contained closed and open questions about taking \npart in RCTs. No postal reminders were sent out for this questionnaire. \n \nFollow-up questionnaire \n \nThe questions asked were informed by the findings from Prescott and colleague\u2019s \nsystematic review [1,2] and consultation with Professor Vikki Entwistle from the \nUniversity of Dundee. Closed questions asked about motivating factors for taking \npart in a trial, health professional involvement, randomisation, use of a placebo, and \nfilling in questionnaires. Quantitative methods were used to analyse participants\u2019 \nresponses to closed questions in the questionnaire. Categorical data were analysed \nusing Chi-squared tests. Two-sided statistical significance was at the 5% level. For \ndichotomous variables odds ratios (ORs) are presented with 95% confidence \nintervals (CIs) for the proportion of participants responding to the closed questions \n 9 \nthat were asked (active treatment vs blinded placebo). When comparing response \nrates for the proportions answering the closed questions between the treatment \ngroups, non-responders were not included in the analysis. Participant data were \nstored, manipulated and analysed using SPSS version 11.5.1. \n \nThe open questions focused on participants\u2019 experience of the trial specifically asking \n\u201cWould you consider taking part in a research study again, if asked?\u201d We also looked at \naspects that they liked by asking: \u201cAre there things that you liked about the study?\u201d \nAspects that respondents disliked were also of interest, respondents were asked: \u201cAre \nthere things that you disliked about the study?\u201d Respondents\u2019 recommendations on how \nto improve the trial were also sought by asking: \u201cIs there anything that you would have \nchanged about the study?\u201d  \n \nContent analysis, a systematic method for assigning text to content categories [13] \nwas used by PF to analyse the data given in response to open questions from the \nquestionnaire. Responses from all open questions were read and reread, and the \ncategories were generated through close inspection and comparison of the data. A \nsecond researcher (SM) assisted with analysing a sample of responses for each \nquestion to enhance the reliability and reproducibility of the coding. The coded data \nset was then entered into an Access database. The themes of the analysis are \nillustrated using representative quotations.  \n \n 10 \nRESULTS \n \nFive hundred and forty (59%) of all 910 MAVIS trial participants returned the \nquestionnaire.  Participants responding to the questionnaire did not differ by gender, \ntype of residence or smoking status from all those randomised to the trial. However, \nthey averaged one year younger than those recruited to the trial (data not shown). \nThere was no statistically significant difference in proportions responding to the \nquestionnaire between different arms of the trial [OR 1.12; 95% CI (0.83, 1.51); p = \n0.450] see Table 1.  \n \nClosed questions  \n \nThere were no statistically significant differences in response rates to the closed \nquestions between active and placebo arms of the trial, see Table 2. Overall, 86% of \nthose responding to the survey reported that helping the research team was very \nimportant to them when deciding to take part in a study like MAVIS. Seventy-two \npercent of people rated helping other people like themselves as being an important \nissue when deciding to take part in a study like MAVIS.  \n \nUnder half of the people reported that being asked to take part by a doctor was very \nimportant to them. Whereas being asked by a nurse was rated to be less important \nwhen deciding to take part in a study. Thirty-four percent of respondents from the \nactive treatment arm and 40% from the placebo arm reported that reducing their risk \nof illness was important to them when deciding to take part in a study. \n \n 11 \nLess important issues were knowing what was in the tablets, filling in a \nquestionnaire or a diary. Least important issues were having to take tablets and \nhaving treatment decided by chance, particularly the possibility of having to take a \nplacebo. \n \nOpen Questions \n \nWritten responses to the open questions are grouped into positive and negative \naspects of the MAVIS trial, and factors impacting on people\u2019s considerations about \ntaking part in future research. \n \nPositive aspects of trial participation \nTrial communication and organisation  \n \nGood communication and friendly personal contact between participants and trial \nstaff seemed particularly important to people in the trial (n=88): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParticipants indicated that they liked the way in which the trial was organised and \nconducted by trial staff. In particular MAVIS trial participants made specific \n\u201cI liked the friendly approach of those members of the team with which I came into contact with\u201d. \n[Participant 011100.] \n \n\u201cI liked the regular communication between researchers and subject.  This gave me a good feeling \nabout the quality of the study.\u201d [Participant 011012.] \n \n\u201cYou kept in touch and I felt part of the programme.\u201d [Participant 011021.] \n \n\u201cOver the period in question, I was treated with kindness and helped throughout.\u201d  [Participant \n022009.] \n 12 \nreference to the value of face-to-face interviews, the design of the diaries, receiving \nChristmas cards and the general \u201cfriendliness\u201d of those involved in the trial (n=52): \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParticipants also reported that they had liked the simplicity and \u201cstraightforward\u201d \nnature of their involvement (n=76):  \n \n \n \nNegative aspects of trial participation \n \nInfection Diaries and questionnaires \n \nAlthough some people reported positive feelings towards completing their infection \ndiary and completing questionnaires, this was the most frequently reported negative \naspect of the trial (n=21). Some respondents suggested that instead of a daily diary \nthey would have preferred a weekly diary: \n \n \n \n\u201cThe instructions were clearly understood.  The face-to-face interview with a member of the research \nteam was excellent.  The layout of the diaries and the colour coding of the pages was also very good \nand easy to complete.\u201d [Participant 011095.] \n \n\u201cIt was very well organised.\u201d [Participant 052038.] \n \n\u201cI thought it was very well organised.  The research nurses were very friendly and it was specially kind \nof them to send out cards to us at Christmas.\u201d [Participant 032025.] \n\u201cSo easy and filling up the diary was no problem.\u201d [Participant 011060.] \n \n\u201cVery simple and straightforward, no complication.\u201d [Participant 011130.] \n \n\u201cIt was very simple to take part.\u201d [Participant 021008.] \n\u201cI am not too keen on questionnaires but I know how important they are to research.\u201d [Participant \n091025.] \n \n\u201cHaving to make a day-to-day diary and filling in forms and such like.\u201d [Participant 011145.] \n \n\u201cAll the writing (which is done by my wife!).\u201d [Participant 022055.] \n \n\u201cI would have favored a weekly diary rather than a daily one.\u201d [Participant 21048.] \n 13 \nUncertainty of placebo and taking pills \nA number of people reported having concerns related to taking pills. Participants \nreported disliking having to swallow the pills as they found this difficult, or \nstruggled to remember to take them each day (n=16):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSome MAVIS participants reported having issues with the possibility of receiving a \nplacebo, as they didn\u2019t know what treatment they had been allocated to (n=12). A \nsmall number of people indicated that they would have preferred to receive the \nactive treatment as opposed to the placebo. Only one participant from the active arm \nreported that they would have liked to know what the pill actually contained: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cI would have excluded the placebo.\u201d [Participant 091069.] \n \n\u201cI would rather have known what type of tablet I was taking.\u201d [Participant 011090.] \n \n\u201cNot knowing if I was taking a vitamin or a dummy.\u201d [Participant 011038.] \n \n\u201cWondering if it was placebo.\u201d [Participant 011087.] \n \n\u201cNo - although a bit wary not knowing whether the tablet was a 'smarty' or the real thing.\u201d [Participant \n012057.] \n \n\u201cBeing already on a lot of pills, my dislike was having to take more.\u201d [Participant 012052.] \n \n\u201cI'm not very good at swallowing capsules or tablets.\u201d [Participant 022025.] \n \n\u201cHaving to remember to take the tablet each day.\u201d [Participant 041057.] \n \n\u201cI would prefer to see what results would be if I had taken minerals and vitamins.\u201d [Participant \n091040.] \n \n\u201cI would have preferred a share of the vitamin tablets as during the last 6 months, I thought the \ntablets contained vitamins so I was fooled.\u201d [Participant 032010.] \n \n\u201cNot really.  But it would have been interesting to know what the real tablets consisted of, especially \nas I was informed that I had been on the real tablets and not the placebos.\u201d [Participant 092028.] \n 14 \nDuration of the trial \nOn the whole MAVIS participants were positive about the one year duration of the \ntrial. However, a small number of participants stated a dislike about the duration \nand commitment required of them during their participation of the trial (n=6). It was \nsuggested that a study for a six-month period would have been preferable and more \nconvenient to them. In terms of feedback of the trial results, a small number of \nparticipants (n=6) indicating that they would like to have known the trial outcome \nsooner. However, the length of time taken to conduct the trial may have been greater \nthat expected by the participants due to the staggered recruitment: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTaking part in future research \n \nIt became clear, that when participants were asked if they would consider taking part \nin future research, their responses reflected their experiences of being a participant in \nthe MAVIS trial. Participants reported both reasons for and against taking part in \nfuture research. In total, over half of the 540 MAVIS respondents indicated that they \nwould be willing to take part in future research (n=283). \n \n \n\u201cThe length of time the survey carried on for and the commitment necessary to see it through.\u201d \n[Participant 011090.] \n \n\u201cHaving wasted a year taking the placebo, I would have preferred if it had been 6 months vitamins \nand minerals and 6 months placebo, but still a blind test.\u201d [Participant 31015.] \n \n\u201cPerhaps the length of your study.  A six-month study might have been better.  Most volunteers went \non holiday during the year and you feel having to take tablets while you were away was an \ninconvenience.  In my case I was in Australia.\u201d [Participant 92077.] \n \n\u201cPerhaps knowing the outcome a bit sooner - after a year you are inclined to forget if the vitamins \nmade any difference to your health.\u201d [Participant 042059.] \n \n \n 15 \nAltruism \n \nThe most commonly described motivation by respondents for taking part in future \nresearch seemed to be based on a desire to \u201chelp\u201d (n=181). Respondents described \nwanting to help other patients (n=92), and helping contribute towards furthering \nmedical knowledge (n=76). The notion and desire to help by participating was a \nrecurring theme throughout the data: \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGiving something back \n \nIt was reported that participants\u2019 decisions to take part in the MAVIS trial and trials \nin general included the consideration of being able to \u201cgiving something back\u201d to the \nhealth service by taking part in the trial (n=18):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cYes, if it was going to help others.\u201d [Participant 011129.] \n \n\u201cYes, because I like to think such research studies make meaningful contributions to medical \nknowledge and science.\u201d  [Participant 011012.] \n \n\u201cYes, if the research will help elderly people in the future, then the study is worthwhile.\u201d [Participant \n011006.] \n \n \n\u201cYes.  NHS has served me well over the years.  Taking part in studies is my way of saying thank \nyou.\u201d [Participant 11018.] \n \n\u201cYes, to put something back into the health service.\u201d [Participant 11107.] \n \n\u201cYes, if the studies appear to be worthwhile.  A long time ago I did some research in a very different \nfield and liked to be associated with research again even if the connection was very minor.\u201d \n[Participant 011045.] \n \n 16 \nWeighing up future participation in trials \n \nSome people\u2019s willingness to take part in future research appeared to depend on \ntheir expected involvement in the specific study, and any perceptions of personal \nbenefit that might be gained through their participation: \n \n \n \n \nOf the 540 respondents around a fifth reported their unwillingness to participate in \nfuture studies (n=117). Additionally some participants\u2019 considered how \n\u201cworthwhile\u201d a study would be when considering taking part in future research \n(n=15). The most frequently reported reason for not wishing to take part in future \nresearch was related to participants\u2019 perceptions of age and poor health status which \nwere perceived as potential barriers towards taking part in any future study (n=32): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cDue to my age, I would not consider it practical for me to take part in any future research studies.\u201d \n[Participant 011147.] \n \n\u201cI think not.  There is a reluctance to take on commitments, which may not be completed or become \nan increasing burden at my time of life.  Resources of energy become increasingly depleted.\u201d  \n[Participant 011089.] \n \n\u201cJust now I am having hospital tests.  So until I am finished I couldn't consider at the moment to take \npart in any study.\u201d [Participant 011028.] \n \n\u201cNo.  I feel I have done my share.  This year I discovered I had CLL, which is being treated with \ntablets.  I have also had a hernia operation recently.\u201d [Participant 022012.] \n\u201cI might consider taking part, depending on what the research was.  The reason is that it would \nprobably help others in the future.\u201d [Participant 011081.] \n \n\u201cYes, but only if I felt comfortable about it and that would depend on what I had to do for the study.\u201d \n[Participant 011002.]  \n 17 \nPersonal interest in study and results \n \nSome participants reported their involvement in the trial as being \u201cinteresting\u201d to \nthem (n=17). Receiving feedback from the trial regarding the study\u2019s findings was an \naspect of the trial that some people reported liking (n=16). A number of participants \nalso reported that trial participation gave them a \u201croutine\u201d which fitted into their \nlifestyle (n=15): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cYes.  I found it very friendly and most interesting.\u201d [Participant 041084.] \n \n\u201cI liked being kept in the picture of what was happening and the results.\u201d [Participant 022096.]  \n \n\u201cIt was easy to take part and did not interfere with my normal routine.\u201d [Participant 011062.] \n \n\u201cTaking tablet medication was a simple and easy thing to do, and there was no weighing of food \nincluded, so it was a simple routine to keep to.\u201d [Participant 011024.] \n 18 \nDISCUSSION \n \n \nThere are many barriers that prevent older people from taking part in randomised \ntrials, restricting the value of trial findings. \n \nDesigning trials with older people \n \nWe found that the notion of \u201chelping\u201d is an important motivating factor in older \npeople\u2019s decisions about participation in RCTs. Ways in which participants reported \nhelping included helping other patients and helping by contributing to medical \nknowledge. Other studies have found similarly altruistic reasons for people to take \npart in research [1,2,5,7,14-16]. Although, it is not clear whether older people \ndemonstrate more altruism than younger people. \n \nParticipants reported that their participation would \u201cdepend\u201d on the demands of the \ntrial, which will vary depending on the design of individual trials. Others have also \nidentified that people\u2019s decisions to participate depend on additional demands such \nas taking trial medication or additional travel and appointments [5,15]. It would be \nadvisable to keep demands on participants to a minimum and make the trial as \nsimple as possible, including providing transportation or covering its costs [17]. \nSome participants of the MAVIS trial referred to keeping the daily infection diaries \nand pills as being \u201ceasy\u201d and \u201cstraightforward\u201d. In particular, it is important to \nremember that this age group may already be taking several daily multiple dose \nmedications in addition to any trial medication.   \n \n 19 \nRegular communication and the friendly approach used by the trial team was an \naspect of the trial that participants valued, as was good organisation and the way in \nwhich the trial was conducted. Given the age and state of health of some participants \ncommunication may be particularly important as they may live alone and have \nlimited contact with other people.  Similar social reasons for older people to take part \nin trials have also been found by Schron et al [18]. \n \nA small number of MAVIS participants felt that they would have preferred to receive \nthe results sooner. As recruitment was staggered it took longer for those recruited at \nthe start of the trial to receive feedback on the results than those recruited at the end \nof the trial. It would be advisable to discuss the duration of the trial and the time \ntaken to receive feedback of the results to people at recruitment. \n  \nSome participants had concerns regarding the placebo, which have been reported in \nother studies [1,2,5,15,19,20]. It is particularly important to have adequate time to \nclearly explain the reasons for randomisation and a placebo, concepts which are \ndifficult for participants of all ages to grasp and recall [5-7,16,21].  \n \nPlanning trials with older people involves considerations specifically for this age \ngroup, and potential participants should be involved in the study design process [7]. \nSome people felt that their health and age would not allow them to take part in a trial \nor that they might not be of use to the trial as they were too old. Ill health and \ndepression in this age group are particularly important reasons for discontinuing a \ntrial once enrolled [22]. Explaining the need for older people, despite poor health, to \nparticipate in trials may help the generalisability of clinical trials. Trial staff need to \n 20 \nbe sensitive to these issues, as well as avoiding prejudicial terms such as \u2018geriatric\u2019, \nwhich may discourage older people from participating [23].  \n \nLimitations \n \nThe results of this study must be interpreted within the context of the MAVIS trial \u2013 \nparticipants completed the questions having already taken part in the trial and had \nreceived the trial results. We did not seek responses from people refusing to \nparticipate in the trial which would have given a broader perspective.   \n \nThe questionnaire was not piloted with older people prior to administration, as it \nwas not feasible due to the very short timescale of the funding. However, the \nquestions asked were provided by researchers who had already undertaken research \non patient participation in trials. Piloting the questionnaire may have identified \npotential issues which could have been addressed [24].  \n \nThe questions were asked in the order of closed questions first, followed by open \nquestions. The closed questions may have prompted participants\u2019 responses to the \nopen questions that followed. However, using both closed and open questions in that \norder is useful for topics about which little is known [25]. \n \nAnalysis of data from open questions was primarily conducted by one researcher, \nwhich may potentially introduce researcher bias.  To help reduce such biases a \nsecond researcher (SM) independently checked a sample of responses for each \nquestion.  \n \n 21 \nThe nature of the trial and those involved may have affected the results and \ngeneralisability of the findings. The trial investigated the effect of multimineral and \nmultivitamin supplementation on infections (particularly common infections like \nupper respiratory tract infections), which may be viewed as less severe conditions \nthan cancer or heart disease. The multimineral and multivitamin supplement may \nhave caused less concern about possible side-effects - an important issue for older \npeople [21,23,26]. Thus participants\u2019 responses may be less relevant to participants \nrecruited to trials related to life-threatening illnesses. Most MAVIS trial participants \nwere under 85yrs of age, so findings may not be generalisable to the oldest old. \n \nConclusions \nOlder people have often been excluded from clinical trials as a direct consequence of \nexclusion criteria focussing on pre-existing illnesses and medication use, rather than \nage per se [6].  With the need to ensure that older people are represented in clinical \ntrials, we need to ensure that concerns of older people are properly addressed.   \n \n \n 22 \nREFERENCES \n(1)Prescott RJ, Counsell CE, Gillespie WJ et al.
