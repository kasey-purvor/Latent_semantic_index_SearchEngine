Height contours are\nobtained by switching between two laser wavelengths. Contour intervals\nfrom 0.5\u20145 mm have been generated by modulating the injection current of a\nsingle laser diode source and are demonstrated on an automotive disc brake\nhub.\n1 . INTROIXJCICN\nElectronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI), also called V\nholography, is widely used as a non\u2014contact optical measurement technique\nfor engineering structures [1 ] ; examples include examining the deformation\nor vibration of body panels, engines and engine components in the\nautomotive industry [2]. An essential feature of ESPI is that it provides\nsimultaneous measurement over an extended area of the target surface. ESPI\nthus offers distinct advantages over point measurement techniques, such as\nlaser velocimetry and interferometric vibrometry, and yields data\nunavai lable from those techniques.\nAlthough ESPI is a powerful tool its versatility is limited when\nimplemented with conventional optical components; precise optical alignment\nis required and the system must essentially be confined to a vibration\nisolation table. Recently, the use of monomode optical fibre techniques\nhas demonstrated that a substantial simplification of the optical\narrangement, with a concomitant increase in flexibility [3], is possible.\nApplications involving test objects not mounted on an optical table are\nthus feasible.\nESPI techniques have also been applied to surface contouring; contouring,\nor profiling, is the measurement of variations in height and thus \"surface\nprofile\" of the object under illumination. Several methods have been\ndemonstrated based on projected fringe [4], reference surface [5] and two\nwavelength techniques [1,61.\n278 \/ SPIE Vol. 1314Fibre Optics '90\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 21 Jul 2011 to 138.250.86.167.

Generally use has been made of neighbouring emission\nlines of an argon [1,] or krypton ion laser to generate high resolution\n( 5\u20143Opm) contour fringes . To obtain more versati 1 i ty ove r the contour\ninterval dye lasers have been used [1]. The use of ion lasers and ion\npumped dye lasers is very costly and restricts the 'field' use of the\ntechniques due to requirements of high electrical power, and in many cases\nwater cooling.\nIn this paper we present a technique based on a diode laser coupled to\nmonomode optical fibre allowing implementation of a complete solid state\nsystem. Wavelength modulation is achieved by modulating the injection\ncurrent of the laser diode. The system is robust and comprises a compact\ntransceiver, containing optics for object illumination, the reference beam\nand the CCD camera, linked to the laser diode by a flexible optical fibre\ncable.\n2 . CCtfltxJRIM BY ESPI\n2.1 ESPI\nESPI may be regarded as in\u2014line image plane holography where the photo\u2014\ngraphic film has been replaced by a high sensitivity television camera.\nThe basic experimental technique is shown in Figure 1. The configuration\nis analagous to that of a Mach\u2014Zehnder interferometer where one mirror is\nreplaced by the object under study. The input laser beam is amplitude\ndivided and spatially filtered into a reference and object beam. The\nobject beam illuminates the test object and is imaged using a camera lens\nonto the face of a CCD camera. \/The reference beam is also directed onto\nthe face of the Ca) camera such that the reference beam wavefront\ninterferes with the wavefront from the object; the spatial resolution of\nthe camera, typically 10\u201420 pm, is too small to resolve conventional\nholographic scale fringes.\nSpeckle is observed in the image plane of the camera where the speckle\nsize, a, is given by [1]\na = 2.4 X f\/ID (1)\nwhere is the laser wavelength, f is the focal length of the imaging lens\nand D is the aperture size. Practically, the speckle size is adjusted to\nbe approximately equal to the resolution of the W camera.\nThe intensity in the camera image plane may be calculated by analogy with\nother two beam interferometers [8], and is found to be:\n1 ( 4th (r)\nI.

Contours of equal\nintensity are separated by a height interval of X. \/2 , which is too small\nfor most practical purposes, especially given that the surface roughness is\ngenerally large on this scale. For this reason ESPI contour or profile\nfringes are normally obtained by illuminating the object at two\nwavelengths, X and X , either simultaneously or sequentially. When the\nobject is sequentially illuminated, the first image is recorded at X and\nthen subtracted from the second image recorded at X.\nUsing equation (2), and with suffices 1 and 2 representing illumination at\nwavelengths X and X leads to\nAl = \u2014 V1 A(h) B(h) (3)\nwhe re we have assumed that I 2 V1 V2 , and that gene rally X = X,\nand\n1 8ith('r\nA(h)=Sin\u2014 \u00f7e1\u00f7e2 (4)\n2\n1 4rth(r)\nB (h) = Sin \u2014 + e1 \u2014 e2 (5)\n2 Xeff\nwhere\nXeff X1X2 \/ (A2 - X) = c\/ (6)\nwhere E is the optical frequency difference between and A2, and c is\nthe velocity of light.\nIn equation (3), A(h) represents profile fringes of height interval A1\/2.\nThese fringes are multiplied by B(h), which is periodic with height\ninterval A\n,\nwhere A >> A1.eff eff\nIn a practical system, the sjgnal of equation (3) is rectified so that tI\nis displayed.

The last term in equation (8) represents profile\nfringes of interval X\/2 which are unrnodulated by B(h), thus preventing regions\ncorresponding to B(h) = 0 from appearing perfectly dark and therefore reducing\nthe visibility of the contour fringes.\n3 . EKPERiNTAL\nThe experimental arrangement is shown in Figure 1. A 50 rr laser diode\n(SONY SLD2O2V\u20143) operating in single longitudinal mode at 802 run was used\nas the source. Temperature stabilisation to 0.02K was achieved using a\nthermoelectric cooler. The beam is first collimated and then coupled into\nthe fibre by a xlO microscope objective. The fibre was single mode at the\nlaser wavelength and had a nominally circular core.\nThe fibre guided beam was amplitude divided using a directional coupler\nfabricated to give 95% of the light in the object arm and 5% in the\nreference arm. The output beam from the normally cleaved fibre end of the\nobject arm was allowed to diverge onlo the test surface placed\napproximately 0.5 m from the output fibre. The scattered light was\ncollected by a camera lens and imaged onto the face of a CCD camera. The\noutput from the reference beam recombines with the scattered light on the\ncamera face.\nThe piezoelectric modulator facility, to control phase [9], was not used in\nthese initial demonstration experiments.\n3.2 Electronic Signal Processing\nThe video output from the camera was high pass filtered and rectified\nbefore displaying on a W monitor. Contour fringes were produced in the\nfollowing manner: the object under test was illuminated with wavelength A1\nand the resulting speckle pattern stored. The wavelength was then shiftea\nto A2 by modulation of the laser injection current. The resulting speckle\npattern, generated at X, was subtracted from the stored frame and the\nresult displayed following basic signal processing. This procedure was\nSPIE Vol. 1314 Fibre Optics '90 \/ 281\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 21 Jul 2011 to 138.250.86.167.

RESULTS\nThe system was arranged as described previously with the laser unxnodulated.\nThe camera lens was set at F\u2014li implying, from equation (1), a speckle size\nof '2O pm.\nFigure 2 shows a speckle image of a stud in an automotive disc brake hub\nilluminated with a single wavelength. Figure 3 shows the contours\ngenerated by modulating the laser wavelength by 50 GHz, measured using a\nscanning Fabry\u2014Perot interferometer, thus generating approximately 3 mm\ncontour fringes. With increased modulation the laser can be made to\noscillate between more widely spaced longitudinal modes resulting in\nnarrower contour fringes, for example a frequency modulation of 350 GHz\ngives rise to 0.5 mm contours.\nFor lower modulations, <20 GHz, the laser wavelength changes continuously\nrather than between discrete modes. In this case the contours produced\nwere too large >10 mm, to be easily observable with the field of view used,\nalthough broad fringes across the object were seen for modulations of\napproximately 20 GHz.\n5 . SUWRY\nA two wavelength holographic contouring technique based on laser diode\nemission frequency modulation and fibre optic components has been\ndemonstrated. Illustrative experiments on a brake disc hub indicate that\nthe technique offers distinct advantages compared to conventional ESPI\ncontouring systems.\n6.
