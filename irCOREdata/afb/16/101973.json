Our main motivation is provided by applications to linear systems\nof ordinary differential equations, general and Hamiltonian, which have both time-preserving and\ntime-reversing symmetries. However the theory gives a uniform method to obtain normal forms and\nunfoldings for a wide variety of linear differential equations with additional structure. We give several\nexamples and include a discussion of the phenomenon of orbit splitting. As a consequence of orbit\nsplitting we observe passing and splitting of eigenvalues in unfoldings.\nContents\n1 Introduction 2\n2 Normal Forms and Unfoldings in gl(V ) 4\n2.1 Normal Forms . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4\n2.2 Unfoldings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\n3 Normal Forms and Unfoldings in an Eigenspace of an (Anti)-Automorphism 8\n3.1 (Anti)-Automorphisms . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8\n3.2 Eigenspaces of (Anti)-Automorphisms . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n3.3 Reduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\n3.4 Orbit Splitting . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\n4 Normal Forms and Examples of Unfoldings 13\n4.1 Normal Forms . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13\n4.2 Examples of Unfoldings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16\n1\n5 Generalizations 17\nA Standard Form of a Bilinear Form 18\nB Orthogonality of Structure Maps 19\n1 Introduction\nLet V be a finite dimensional real vector space and g an eigenspace of an (anti)-automorphism \u03b3 of\norder two of the Lie algebra gl(V ). Let G be a Lie subgroup of GL(V ) consisting of structure preserving\ntransformations such that the action\nL 7\u2192 gLg\u22121 with L \u2208 g and g \u2208 G,\npreserves g. Then the G-orbit of L \u2208 g given by OrbG(L) = {gLg\u22121 | g \u2208 G} is again a subset of g. In\nthis paper we address the following two problems:\ni) Classify all G-orbits (normal forms) of elements L in g;\nii) Find the unfoldings of L in g.\nWe also briefly consider generalizations to abelian groups of (anti)-automorphisms of order two.\nSetting and Motivation\nAny local study of equilibrium points of vector fields starts with an analysis of their linearizations. These\nare in one-to-one correspondence with linear maps. This correspondence respects both the transformation\nproperties of linear vector fields under linear coordinate changes and their Lie algebra structure. Moreover\ndynamical systems theory is often concerned with vector fields which preserve some structure. Well-known\nexamples are equivariant, reversible and Hamiltonian vector fields. The linearizations of such vector fields\npreserve the same structure and the spaces of structure preserving linear maps can be identified with\neigenspaces of (anti)-automorphisms of order two acting on the space of all linear maps.\nExample 1.1 Consider reversible linear vector fields on Rn. Such a vector field is determined by an\ninfinitesimally reversible linear map L satisfying RL = \u2212LR, where the linear structure map R satisfies\nR2 = I and R 6= \u00b1I. We can also write this condition as \u03c6R(L) = \u2212L where the automorphism \u03c6R\nis defined as \u03c6R(A) := R\n\u22121AR for all A \u2208 gl(Rn). Thus g = {A \u2208 gl(Rn) | \u03c6R(A) = \u2212A} is the\n\u22121 eigenspace of \u03c6R. The structure preserving transformation group G consists of R-equivariant maps\nG = {g \u2208 GL(Rn) | gR = Rg}, that is elements of G map g into itself. See section 3.2 for a precise\ndefinition of the structure preserving transformation group. \u0003\nExample 1.2 Similarly a Hamiltonian linear vector field is determined by an infinitesimally symplectic\nlinear map L. Let \u03c9 be a symplectic form, ie a non-degenerate skew symmetric bilinear form, on R2n.\nLet \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009 be the standard inner product on R2n. Then there is a structure map J satisfying J\u2217 = \u2212J\nand J2 = \u2212I such that \u03c9(x, y) = \u3008x, Jy\u3009 for all x, y \u2208 R2n. An infinitesimally symplectic map L satisfies\n\u03c9(Lx, y) = \u2212\u03c9(x, Ly) or equivalently \u3008x, L\u2217Jy\u3009 = \u2212\u3008x, JL\u3009 for all x, y \u2208 R2n. We write this condition\nas \u03c8J(L) = \u2212L, where \u03c8J is the anti-automorphism defined by \u03c8J(A) := J\u22121A\u2217J , for all A \u2208 gl(R2n).\nAgain g = {A \u2208 gl(R2n) | \u03c8J(A) = \u2212A} is the \u22121 eigenspace of \u03c8J . In this case the structure preserving\ntransformation group G consists of maps that preserve \u03c9, that is G = {g \u2208 GL(R2n) | \u03c9(gx, gy) =\n\u03c9(x, y), for all x, y \u2208 R2n}, which we can rephrase using J as G = {g \u2208 GL(R2n) | g\u2217Jg = J}. \u0003\nExample 1.3 Combining the previous two examples, a reversible Hamiltonian linear vector field is de-\ntermined by an infinitesimally reversible symplectic linear map L. Usually one requires that R is an\nanti-symplectic map, and then \u03c6R and \u03c8J commute. Thus infinitesimally reversible symplectic maps on\nR2n are elements of the intersection of two eigenspaces\n{A \u2208 gl(R2n) | \u03c6R(A) = \u2212A} \u2229 {A \u2208 gl(R2n) | \u03c8J(A) = \u2212A},\n2\nwhich, by virtue of the fact that \u03c6R and \u03c8J commute, is the simultaneous eigenspace of \u03c6R and \u03c8J . The\nstructure preserving transformation group for infinitesimally reversible symplectic maps is the intersection\nof the transformation groups of Examples 1.1 and 1.2: G = {g \u2208 GL(R2n) | gR = Rg, g\u2217Jg = J}. \u0003\nThe main motivation for the theory developed in this paper is the normal form and unfolding problem for\nlinear reversible equivariant vector fields in both the general and Hamiltonian cases. The spaces of such\nvector fields have been described by Lamb & Roberts [20] in the general case and can be characterized as\nsimultaneous eigenspaces of abelian groups of (anti)-automorphisms of order two. The theory developed in\nthis article provides a uniform approach to all such problems. The authors plan to report on applications\nof this theory to linear (Hamiltonian) reversible equivariant vector fields in forthcoming publications.\nIn some cases, including Hamiltonian and equivariant vector fields, the corresponding eigenspaces are Lie\nsubalgebras of gl(V ) and the normal form and unfolding theory for maps in gl(V ) (see Section 2), carries\nover almost automatically. However reversible vector fields, for example, do not form a Lie subalgebra.\nThis paper shows that, despite this, analogous normal form and unfolding theories can been developed.\nNormal form and unfolding problems have a long history ranging from the classical Jordan normal form\nto the more modern unfolding theory of Arnol\u2019d [1]. We give a brief overview without trying to be\ncomplete. Williamson [30] was the first to find normal forms for infinitesimally symplectic maps. Later\na more constructive approach was given by Burgoyne & Cushman [4, 5]. In this article we follow their\napproach to a large extent. Unfoldings of infinitesimally symplectic maps were independently given by\nGalin [12] and Koc\u00b8ak [19]. For extensive studies of particular systems also see van der Meer [21] and\nCotter [7]. Normal forms and unfoldings of infinitesimally reversible maps were first studied by Palmer\n[24] and later by Sevryuk [26] and Shih [27]. A particular example where the linear part plays a crucial\nrole can be found in Iooss [17]. Other contributions without a direct relation to dynamical systems are\nDempwolff [9], Jacobson [18] for semi-linear maps and Djukovic et al. [10] and Patera & Rousseau [25]\nfor subspaces of gl(V ) which are not Lie algebras. Wiegman [31] considers normal forms for maps over\nthe quaternions. Studies of mixed structures include Hoveijn [14] on infinitesimally reversible symplectic\nmaps and Melbourne [22] and Melbourne & Dellnitz [23] on infinitesimally symplectic equivariant maps.\nRemark 1.4 Note that the description using (anti)-automorphisms is not limited to linear vector fields.\nIn fact the latter are just the 1-jets of C\u221e-vector fields. The (anti)-automorphisms can equally well be\ndefined on k-jet spaces of vector fields, where they are still Lie algebra (anti)-automorphisms of order\ntwo. The normalization procedures for C\u221e-vector fields described in Broer et al. [3] can be combined\nwith the ideas developed in this paper to give a corresponding nonlinear normal form theory. \u0003\nRemark 1.5 Another generalisation of the theory would be to consider a general (compact) group \u0393\nof (anti)-automorphisms acting on gl(V ) and classify normal forms and unfoldings of linear maps in an\nisotypic component g of the action of \u0393 on gl(V ).\nMain Results\nThe main results of the paper are the Reduction Lemma 3.8, the Unfolding Lemma 3.10 and the Orbit\nSplitting Theorem 3.12. A formal statement of the Reduction Lemma requires some technical notation,\nbut it may be informally summarised as:\nReduction Lemma\nThe normal form of a linear map L in an eigenspace of an (anti)-automorphism is determined by the\nsemi-simple part of L on a reduced space.\nThis lemma greatly simplifies the problem of finding normal forms, because the actual computations are\nlimited to low dimensional spaces. It is essential for the Reduction Lemma that the Jordan-Chevalley\ndecomposition holds in the eigenspaces of an (anti)-automorphism. Using the notation introduced above,\nthe Unfolding Lemma reads as follows.\nUnfolding Lemma\nLet \u03b3 be an (anti)-automorphism of \ufb01nite order and let L \u2208 g. Then the restriction of the GL(V )-\ncentralizer unfolding of L \u2208 gl(V ) to g is equivalent to the G-centralizer unfolding in g.\nThis means that we do not need to find a new way of computing unfoldings in a subset of gl(V ) with a\nsmaller structure preserving transformation group G. We simply use a version of the existing Arnol\u2019d or\n3\ncentralizer unfolding, see Lemma 2.5. As an alternative one might use the representation theory of sl(2)\nto find unfoldings, see Koc\u00b8ak [19] or Cushman & Sanders [8].\nOrbit splitting is a well known phenomenon for infinitesimally symplectic maps. If such a map has a pair\nof double imaginary eigenvalues then there are two inequivalent normal forms. They may be distinguished\nby signs, see Example 3.7. In general the GL(V )-orbit of a map L \u2208 g may intersect g in severalG-orbits\nof L. The Orbit Splitting Theorem states that there are at most two such orbits.\nOrbit Splitting Theorem\nThe intersection of the GL(V )-orbit of L in gl(V ) and g consists of at most two G-orbits.\nIn general inequivalent G-orbits have different unfoldings, which may give rise to passing and splitting of\neigenvalues when parameters are varied, see Section 4.2 for details.\nOrganization\nThe remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the theory for normal forms\nand unfoldings in gl(V ). We use this as a starting point for finding normal forms and unfoldings in\nthe eigenspace of an (anti)-automorphism in Section 3. In Section 4 we apply the results of Section 3\nto present normal forms and unfoldings in eigenspaces of (anti)-automorphisms of order two. Finally\nin Section 5 we generalize our results to abelian groups of (anti)-automorphisms of order two. We also\nsuggest some further possible generalizations.\n2 Normal Forms and Unfoldings in gl(V )\nA linear differential equation is given by x\u02d9 = Ax where A \u2208 gl(V ). A coordinate change y = gx, with\ng \u2208 GL(V ), transforms this to y\u02d9 = gAg\u22121y. Thus linear vector fields transform as linear maps. We\ntherefore identify the space of linear vector fields on V with gl(V ). Here we review the normal form and\nunfolding theory for linear maps in gl(V ) in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 respectively.\n2.1 Normal Forms\nLet V be a finite dimensional real vector space. Then gl(V ) is the Lie algebra of all linear maps from V\nto itself. The Lie group GL(V ) is the group of all invertible linear transformations from V to itself. The\naction of GL(V ) on gl(V ) is given by the adjoint action, that is, by similarity transformations:\nAdg : L 7\u2192 gLg\u22121\nThe GL(V )-orbits\nOrbGL(V )(L) = {gLg\u22121 | g \u2208 GL(V )}\nof the adjoint action are precisely the equivalence classes we are interested in classifying. From now on\nwe will use the word \u2018orbits\u2019 only. It is well known that for the adjoint action of GL(V ) the orbit of L in\ngl(V ) is determined by two invariants: the eigenvalues and Jordan structure of L. The Jordan-Chevalley\ndecomposition, Reduction Lemma and Reconstruction Lemma described below formalize this fact.\nJordan-Chevalley Decomposition\nThe Jordan-Chevalley decomposition splits a linear map L into the sum of its semi-simple and nilpotent\nparts. In order to define semi-simple we need to work over the complex numbers, so in this section\nwe assume that L is defined on a complexified space V . In Theorem 2.3 we translate our results for a\nreal space V . A map S is called semi-simple if the algebraic and geometric multiplicity of each of its\neigenvalues are equal. A map N is called nilpotent if Nn = 0 for some integer n. The least such integer\nis called the height of N .\nTheorem 2.1 (Jordan-Chevalley decomposition)\nFor each L \u2208 gl(V ) there exist a unique semi-simple S \u2208 gl(V ) and a unique nilpotent N \u2208 gl(V ) such\nthat [S,N ] = 0 and L = S +N .\n4\nThe eigenvalues of L are determined by the semi-simple part S while the nilpotent part N determines\nits Jordan structure. The Jordan-Chevalley decomposition of a linear map is Adg-equivariant and so is a\nproperty of the GL(V )-orbit rather than the individual map, see Humphreys [16]. The Jordan-Chevalley\ndecomposition almost automatically extends to all the classical Lie algebras, see [16, 29]. We shall see in\nSection 3 that it also extends to eigenspaces of Lie algebra (anti)-automorphisms acting on gl(V ).\nReduction\nThe Reduction Lemma, due to Burgoyne & Cushman [5, 6], exploits the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition\nto simplify the normal form problem for linear maps. It formalizes the classical Jordan normal form\nalgorithm and works in all classical Lie algebras. In the first part of this section we will work on the\ncomplexified space V .\nLet L \u2208 gl(V ) be a linear map with Jordan-Chevalley decomposition L = S + N . An L-invariant\nsubspace of V is said to be indecomposable if it has no proper L-invariant subspaces. The restriction of L\nto an indecomposable L-invariant subspace has a unique eigenvalue and such a subspace is a generalized\neigenspace for that eigenvalue. The space V decomposes as a direct sum of indecomposable L-invariant\nsubspaces V = \u2295\u03bbV\u03bb which is unique up to permutations unless there are two or more V\u03bb with equal\neigenvalues and equal heights. Moreover the restrictions of S and N to the indecomposable subspaces are\nthe semi-simple and nilpotent parts of the restrictions of L. The characteristic polynomial of L factors\nover the indecomposable L-invariant subspaces. The height n of the restriction of N to such a space can\nbe computed from the characteristic polynomial of the restriction of L, see Burgoyne & Cushman [4].\nLemma 2.2 (Reduction Lemma)\nLet V\u03bb be an indecomposable L-invariant space with eigenvalue \u03bb. Assume that the restriction of N to V\u03bb\nhas height n. Then there is an S-invariant complement W\u03bb of NV\u03bb in V\u03bb such that V\u03bb = W\u03bb \u2295NV\u03bb =\nW\u03bb \u2295NW\u03bb \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295Nn\u22121W\u03bb. For each j = 0 . . . n\u2212 1 we have dimN jW\u03bb = dimW\u03bb. The restriction of\nL to V\u03bb is determined up to similarity by the restriction of S to W\u03bb.\nThus if we wish to classify a linear map L we only have to classify its semi-simple part S by Lemma\n2.2. From now on we only work over the real numbers so V is again a real space. With a slight abuse\nof notation we write again V\u03bb even if \u03bb is complex. Theorem 2.3 relates the real spaces to the complex\nones. On many occasions we distinguish four cases. If \u03bb is zero or \u03bb = \u03b1 is real we write V0 and V\u03b1 for\nthe generalized eigenspaces. If \u03bb = \u00b1i\u03b2 is purely imaginary or \u03bb = \u03b1\u00b1 i\u03b2 is complex we write V\u00b1i\u03b2 and\nV\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2 for the real generalized eigenspaces.\nTheorem 2.3 Let L = S+N be the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition of L and let V\u03bb be an indecomposable\nL-invariant subspace with eigenvalue \u03bb. Assume that the restriction of N to V\u03bb has height n.\na) Real eigenvalues. If \u03bb = \u03b1 \u2208 R then (L\u2212\u03b1)n = 0. In this case dimW\u03b1 = 1, dim V\u03b1 = n and for\nall e \u2208 V\u03b1 we have Se = \u03b1e.\nb) Complex eigenvalues. If \u03bb = \u03b1\u00b1 i\u03b2 with \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 R and \u03b2 6= 0 then ((L\u2212 \u03b1)2 + \u03b22)n = 0. In this\ncase dimW\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2 = 2, dim(V\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2) = 2n and for all v \u2208 V\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2 we have (S \u2212 \u03b1)2v = \u2212\u03b22v. For any\ne \u2208 W\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2 let f = 1\u03b2 (S \u2212 \u03b1)e, then \u3008e, f\u3009 is a basis of W\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2 .\nThus the restriction of the semi-simple part S to a subspace W\u03bb always has normal form\n(\n\u03b1\n)\nor\n(\n\u03b1 \u2212\u03b2\n\u03b2 \u03b1\n)\n,\ndepending on whether \u03bb is real or complex, respectively. Note that in case of complex eigenvalues we can\nalways find a basis such that \u03b2 > 0.\nReconstruction\nSuppose we are given a linear map L \u2208 gl(V ) with Jordan-Chevalley decomposition L = S +N and an\nindecomposable L-invariant space V\u03bb. From Lemma 2.2 we know that there is an S-invariant complement\n5\nW\u03bb of NV\u03bb in V\u03bb such that V\u03bb = W\u03bb \u2295 NW\u03bb \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Nn\u22121W\u03bb, where n is the height of N on V\u03bb and\ndimN jW\u03bb = dimW\u03bb. In Theorem 2.3 we gave normal forms for the restriction of S to W\u03bb. To find\nnormal forms for L on V\u03bb we start with the basis of W\u03bb used for the normal form of S on W\u03bb in Theorem\n2.3 and apply N to this n\u2212 1 times to generate a basis for V\u03bb.\nLemma 2.4 (Reconstruction Lemma)\nLet L = S + N be the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition of L and V\u03bb be an indecomposable L-invariant\nsubspace. Let W\u03bb be an S-invariant complement to NV\u03bb in V\u03bb and assume that N has height n on V\u03bb.\nThen, if \u3008e1 . . . , em\u3009 is a basis for W\u03bb, the set \u3008e1 . . . , em, Ne1 . . . , Nem, Nn\u22121e1 . . . , Nn\u22121em\u3009 is a basis\nfor V\u03bb.\nThe corresponding normal forms for indecomposable L-invariant subspaces with real and complex eigen-\nvalues are the familiar real Jordan blocks\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u03b1\n1\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\n1 \u03b1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 and\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u03b1 \u2212\u03b2\n\u03b2 \u03b1\n1 0 \u03b1 \u2212\u03b2\n0 1 \u03b2 \u03b1\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\n1 0 \u03b1 \u2212\u03b2\n0 1 \u03b2 \u03b1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\nwith respect to the bases \u3008e,Ne, . . . , Nn\u22121e\u3009 and \u3008e, f,Ne,Nf, . . . , Nn\u22121e,Nn\u22121f\u3009, respectively. Here e\nand f are vectors as in Theorem 2.3.\n2.2 Unfoldings\nA general theory for unfoldings or deformations of maps in gl(V ) is given by Arnol\u2019d [1]. Here we use the\nReduction Lemma to describe this theory, see also [14]. Note thatGL(V )-orbits are smooth submanifolds\nof gl(V ), see Bredon [2].\nDefinition 2.1 A smooth map  L : Rp \u2192 gl(V ) : \u00b5 7\u2192  L(\u00b5) with  L(0) = L is called an unfolding or a\ndeformation of L. If  L is transverse to the GL(V )-orbit through L at L, then it is said to be versal.\nFrom now on we will only use the word \u2018unfolding\u2019. We are especially interested in unfoldings of a map L\nhaving a minimum number of parameters but still parametrising a section transverse to the GL(V )-orbit\nthrough L0. We therefore make the following definition, see Arnol\u2019d [1].\nDefinition 2.2 Two unfoldings A(\u00b5) and B(\u00b5) of L are called equivalent if they are similar as families\nof linear maps. This means that there is a smooth family of transformation g(\u00b5) \u2208 GL(V ) such that\ng(\u00b5)A(\u00b5)g(\u00b5)\u22121 = B(\u00b5) for all \u00b5 \u2208 Rp. An unfolding  L of L is called miniversal if (a) for every other\nunfolding A : Rq \u2192 gl(V ) of L there exists a smooth map \u03c7 : Rq \u2192 Rp such that A is equivalent to  L \u25e6\u03c7,\nand (b)  L has the minimal number of parameters possible for unfoldings with this property.\nThe number of parameters for a miniversal unfolding is equal to the codimension of the GL(V )-orbit\nthrough L and so is called the codimension of L. Geometrically, the image of a miniversal unfolding of\nL is a submanifold of gl(V ) whose tangent space at L is a complement to the tangent space at L of the\nGL(V )-orbit through L.\nArnol\u2019d [1] showed that miniversal unfoldings can be obtained by taking orthogonal complements to\ntangent spaces of GL(V )-orbits with respect to the inner product \u3008A,B\u3009 = Trace(A\u2217B) on gl(V ). Some\ncomputations show that the centralizer or Arnol\u2019d unfolding is:\n{L+M\u2217 |M \u2208 Ker(adL)},\nwhere adL(M) = [M,L] = ML \u2212 LM . By applying the adjoint action of GL(V ) on gl(V ) to this\nunfolding we can obtain an unfolding at any other point on the GL(V )-orbit through L. Transversality\n6\nand miniversality are preserved by this transformation, but orthogonality will usually be lost. Another\nway to find unfoldings is the use of representation theory of sl(2), see Koc\u00b8ak [19] or Cushman & Sanders\n[8].\nWe now give a more detailed description of the centralizer unfolding using the Reduction Lemma. The\nidea is to start with the centralizer unfolding of the semi-simple part of L and then reconstruct the\nunfolding of L in several steps. An advantage of this approach is that it depends only on the Jordan-\nChevalley decomposition and not on a particular normal form for L. Furthermore we only have to\ncompute matrices which commute with a semi-simple matrix on a low dimensional space.\nAssume that L = S + N has only one eigenvalue on V and let V = V1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Vp, where each Vi is\nan indecomposable L-invariant subspace. For each Vi we have the decomposition Vi = Wi \u2295 NWi \u2295\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295Nni\u22121Wi, where Wi is an S-invariant complement to NVi in Vi. Assume that the heights ni of N\nrestricted to Vi satisfy n1 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 np. Let W = W1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295Wp and let \u3008ei,1, . . . , ei,q\u3009 be a basis for Wi.\nNote that the Wi all have the same dimension dimWi = q, so we may assume that their bases have been\nchosen such that the matrices of Si = S|Wi are equal.\nTo find the centralizer unfolding of L first choose a basis for uW1 = {M :W1 \u2192W1 | adS(M) = 0}. Only\nin this step is it necessary to compute commuting matrices. The next step is to extend the basis for uW1\nto a basis for uW = {M : W \u2192 W | adS(M) = 0}. Then we extend this basis to the set of maps on V\nwhich commute with N . The final step is to construct a basis for uV = {M : V \u2192 V | adL(M) = 0}. We\nmake this more precise in the following Unfolding Lemma, which is a corrected version of that in [14].\nLemma 2.5 (Unfolding Lemma)\n1. Construct a basis \u3008B(1), . . . , B(r)\u3009 of uW1 .\n2. Extend the basis of uW1 to a basis of uW by de\ufb01ning B\n(k)\nij :W \u2192W by:\nB\n(k)\nij =\n{\nB(k) : Wj \u2192Wi\n0 : Wj\u2032 \u2192Wi\u2032 , (i\u2032, j\u2032) 6= (i, j)\nThen {B(k)ij | i, j = 1, . . . , p and k = 1, . . . , r} is a basis of uW .\n3. Extend the basis of uW to a basis of uV by de\ufb01ning B\u02dc\n(k)\nij : V \u2192 V by:\nB\u02dc\n(k)\nij N\nmej,l =\n{\nNmB\n(k)\nij ej,l j \u2265 i\nNm+ni\u2212njB\n(k)\nij ej,l j < i\nfor l = 1, . . . , q and m = 0, . . . , nj \u2212 1. Then the NnB\u02dc(k)ij for 0 \u2264 n < min(ni, nj) form a basis of\nuV .\n4. Let \u3008B1, . . . , Bd\u3009 be a basis of uV , then L(\u00b5) = L+\n\u2211d\ni=1 \u00b5iB\n\u2217\ni is a miniversal deformation of L.\nProof. The construction in the proposition is a formalization of the construction by Arnol\u2019d [1], which\nin turn is based on Gantmacher\u2019s construction in [13]. We restrict ourselves to the case that L has a\nreal eigenvalue. First we prove that the B1, . . . , Bd are linearly independent, then we prove that they\nspan uV . By construction the B\n(1), . . . , B(r) are linearly independent. Then the B\n(k)\nij are also linearly\nindependent since they map Wj to Wi. In step 3) the B\n(k)\nij are only extended to V so the B\u02dc\n(k)\nij are still\nlinearly independent. (Here we have to take into account that the height of N onWj may be smaller than\nthe height of N on Wi so that N\nm+ni\u2212nj = 0 as soon as Nm = 0.) The NnB\u02dc\n(k)\nij are linearly independent\nbecause they map Wj to N\nnWi. The number of N\nnB\u02dc\n(k)\nij is equal to\n\u2211\ni,j min(ni, nj) =\n\u2211\ni(2i \u2212 1)ni\nwhich is equal to the number of parameters in the Arnol\u2019d unfolding, so the NnB\u02dc\n(k)\nij span uV . Thus the\nNnB\u02dc\n(k)\nij form a basis of uV . 2\n7\n3 Normal Forms and Unfoldings in an Eigenspace of an (Anti)-\nAutomorphism\nWe outline a general theory for maps in eigenspaces of Lie algebra (anti)-automorphisms of order two act-\ning on gl(V ) and show that a GL(V )-orbit in gl(V ) can split into at most two G-orbits when intersected\nwith such an eigenspace. Here G is the structure preserving transformation group.\nTo characterize normal forms in Section 2.1 and find their unfoldings in Section 2.2 we made essential\nuse of the following facts. First, the equivalence classes are the orbits of the adjoint action of a transfor-\nmation group. Second, the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition leads to a reduction of the normal form and\nunfolding problems to semi-simple maps. Third, the Lie algebra of the transformation group enables us\nto characterize tangent spaces to orbits and hence to find miniversal unfoldings as complements.\nIn this section we show that the eigenspaces of (anti)-automorphisms have all the Lie algebraic structure\nthat is needed to generalize these facts. Appropriate structure preserving transformation Lie groups can\nbe defined and the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition still holds. The latter leads to a Reduction Lemma\nwhich can be used to simplify the computation of normal forms and miniversal unfoldings.\n3.1 (Anti)-Automorphisms\nWe begin by describing some properties of (anti)-automorphisms of gl(V ). Where it is convenient we\nidentify V with Rn and hence gl(V ) with gl(n,R).\nDefinition 3.1 A linear map \u03b3 : gl(V ) \u2192 gl(V ) is an automorphism of gl(V ) if \u03b3(AB) = \u03b3(A)\u03b3(B)\nand an anti-automorphism if \u03b3(AB) = \u03b3(B)\u03b3(A).\nWe will generally denote an automorphism by \u03c6, an anti-automorphism by \u03c8 and will write \u03b3 if we do\nnot want to make a distinction. Let\n\u03c3(\u03b3) =\n{\n1, if \u03b3 is an automorphism\n\u22121, if \u03b3 is an anti-automorphism.\nNote that for any \u03b3 the Lie bracket [A,B] = AB \u2212BA on gl(V ) satisfies\n\u03b3 ([A,B]) = \u03c3(\u03b3) [\u03b3(A), \u03b3(B)] .\nThus \u03b3 is a Lie algebra automorphism or anti-automorphism.\nThe next proposition describes all (anti)-automorphisms of gl(V ) \u223c= gl(n,R) and shows that they have\nassociated structure maps s \u2208 GL(n,R). A proof based on the symmetries of the Dynkin diagram can\nbe found in Freudenthal & de Vries [11].\nProposition 3.1 Every automorphism of gl(n,R) has the form \u03c6s(L) = s\n\u22121Ls, L \u2208 gl(n,R), for some\ns \u2208 GL(n,R). The anti-automorphisms of gl(n,R) are all of the form \u03c8s = \u03c6s \u25e6 \u03c8I where \u03c8I(L) = L\u2217.\nHere L\u2217 is defined as \u3008x, L\u2217y\u3009 := \u3008Lx, y\u3009, for all x, y \u2208 Rn and \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009 is an inner product on Rn. In the\nnext lemma we collect some simple properties of an (anti)-automorphism of order two.\nLemma 3.2 Let \u03b3s be an (anti)-automorphism of order two on gl(V ) with structure map s \u2208 GL(V ).\nThen:\na) \u03b3\u03b1s = \u03b3s for all \u03b1 \u2208 R;\nb) The eigenvalues of \u03b3s are \u00b11;\nc) \u03b3s is semi-simple.\nNote that a) holds for any (anti)-automorphism and c) is true for (anti)-automorphisms of finite order.\nThe next proposition lists some properties of structure maps.\nProposition 3.3 Let s be a structure map associated to an (anti)-automorphism \u03b3s of order two. Then\ns has the following properties:\n8\na) det s = \u00b11;\nb) s is orthogonal;\nc) s2 = \u00b1I;\nd) There exists a basis such that the matrix of s is given by s =\n(\nIp 0\n0 \u2212Iq\n)\nor s =\n(\n0 \u2212In\nIn 0\n)\n.\nHere a) is true in general because it is a consequence of property a) in Lemma 3.2 and b) holds for any\n(anti)-automorphism of finite order.\nProof of Proposition 3.3. Using \u03b3\u03b1s = \u03b3s for all \u03b1 \u2208 R, we can scale s such that det s = \u00b11.\nFor the remaining parts we distinguish between automorphisms and anti-automorphisms. We use the\nfact that s transforms as s 7\u2192 gsg\u22121 or s 7\u2192 gsg\u2217 under a coordinate transformation g depending on\nwhether s is associated to an automorphism or an anti-automorphism, see Section 3.2. Let \u03b3s = \u03c6s\nbe an automorphism. Then \u03c62s = I immediately implies s\n2 = \u00b1I. This in turn implies that s has\neigenvalues \u00b11 or \u00b1i and that s is semi-simple, which yields the normal forms in d). Thus after a\nsuitable transformation s is orthogonal. Let \u03b3s = \u03c8s be an anti-automorphism. Then \u03c8\n2\ns = I implies\ns\u2217 = \u00b1s and so is semi-simple. Thus s has either real or purely imaginary eigenvalues. Restrict s to an\nindecomposable s-invariant space, then by applying the map g = \u03c1I the eigenvalues of s are scaled to \u00b11\nor \u00b1i. This transformed s is orthogonal and moreover satisfies s2 = \u00b1I. Thus it takes one of the forms\nin d) with respect to a suitable basis. 2\n3.2 Eigenspaces of (Anti)-Automorphisms\nThe eigenspace of an (anti)-automorphism \u03b3 corresponding to an eigenvalue \u00b5 is denoted by\ngl\u00b5(V ) = {L \u2208 gl(V ) | \u03b3(L) = \u00b5L}.\nHere we only consider (anti)-automorphisms of order two so that gl\u00b5(V ) is again a real space. The next\nlemma gives some basic properties of the eigenspaces of \u03b3.\nLemma 3.4 Let \u03b3 be an (anti)-automorphism of order two on gl(V ). Then:\na) gl\u00b5(V ) is a Lie subalgebra of gl\u00b5(V ) if and only if \u00b5 = \u03c3(\u03b3);\nb) gl\u00b5(V ) is a Lie submodule of gl(V ) over the Lie subalgebra gl\u03c3(\u03b3)(V );\nc) gl(V ) splits as a sum of eigenspaces, gl(V ) = gl1(V )\u2295 gl\u22121(V ).\nNote that a) and b) hold for any (anti)-automorphisms of finite order.\nProof of Lemma 3.4. Let A \u2208 gl\u00b5(V ) and B \u2208 gl\u03bd(V ). Then \u03b3([A,B]) = \u03c3(\u03b3)[\u03b3(A), \u03b3(B)] =\n\u03c3(\u03b3)\u00b5\u03bd[A,B]. Since \u03b3 is of order two it is semi-simple and its eigenvalues are \u00b11, and so gl(V ) splits as\nin c). 2\nJordan-Chevalley Decomposition\nThe Jordan-Chevalley Decomposition 2.1 holds in any Lie subalgebra g of gl(V ), see [16]. The next\nproposition states that it holds in any eigenspace of an (anti)-automorphism of gl(V ). Note that gl\u00b5(V )\nneed not be real for the proposition to hold.\nProposition 3.5 If L \u2208 gl\u00b5(V ) and L = S + N with S semi-simple, N nilpotent and [S,N ] = 0, then\nboth S and N are elements of gl\u00b5(V ).\nProof. Let L \u2208 gl\u00b5(V ) have Jordan-Chevalley decomposition L = S + N with S,N \u2208 gl(V ). Then\n\u03b3(L) = \u00b5L = \u00b5S + \u00b5N and so \u00b5S + \u00b5N is the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition of \u03b3(L). We also\nhave \u03b3(L) = \u03b3(S) + \u03b3(N). Since \u03b3(S) = s\u22121Ss or \u03b3(S) = s\u22121S\u2217s we see that \u03b3(S) is semi-simple.\nFurthermore \u03b3(N)n = \u03b3(Nn) = 0 and so \u03b3(N) is nilpotent. Finally [\u03b3(S), \u03b3(N)] = \u03c3(\u03b3)\u03b3([S,N ]) = 0.\nThus \u03b3(S)+ \u03b3(N) is the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition of \u03b3(L). Since this decomposition is unique we\nhave \u03b3(S) = \u00b5S and \u03b3(N) = \u00b5N . 2\n9\nRemark 3.1 Note that the subspaces of symmetric and skew-symmetric matrices in gl(n,R), the \u00b11\neigenspaces of the anti-automorphism L 7\u2192 L\u2217, both consist entirely of semi-simple matrices. Thus for\nboth these eigenspaces the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition is trivial. \u0003\nCoordinate Transformations\nWe next look at coordinate transformations. If L \u2208 gl(V ) and g \u2208 GL(V ), then applying the coordinate\nchange g transforms L to gLg\u22121. An automorphism \u03c6s of gl(V ) transforms to \u03c6gsg\u22121 and an anti-\nautomorphism \u03c8s to \u03c8gsg\u2217 . We therefore consider the action of GL(V ) on pairs (L, s) given by (L, s) 7\u2192\ng.(L, s), where g.(L, s) is a shorthand for (gLg\u22121, gsg\u22121) if \u03b3s is an automorphism and (gLg\n\u22121, gsg\u2217) if\n\u03b3s is an anti-automorphism. Classifying pairs with respect to this action is equivalent to first bringing\ns into normal form using any transformation from GL(V ), and then classifying maps L using only\ntransformations which preserve s. The group of such transformations is\nGL+1s = {g \u2208 GL(V ) | gsg\u22121 = s}\nGL\u22121s = {g \u2208 GL(V ) | gsg\u2217 = s}\nfor automorphism and anti-automorphisms, respectively. The group GL(V ) can be indentified with the\nset of invertible elements in gl(V ) and so the (anti)-automorphism \u03b3s can also be regarded as an operator\non GL(V ). Thus \u03b3s(g) = s\n\u22121gs for automorphisms and \u03b3s(g) = s\n\u22121g\u2217s for anti-automorphisms. As\nbefore we set \u03c3(\u03b3s) equal to +1 for automorphisms to \u22121 for anti-automorphims. Then the group of\nstructure preserving transformations can be characterized as\nGL\u03c3(\u03b3s)s (V ) = {g \u2208 GL(V ) | \u03b3s(g) = g\u03c3(\u03b3s)}.\nWith help of the structure preserving transformation group we summarize the discussion so far in the\nfollowing lemma.\nLemma 3.6 (Orbit Lemma)\nThe GL(V )-orbit of the pair (L, s) is equivalent to the GL\u03c3(\u03b3s)s (V )-orbit of L.\nThere is, however, a slightly larger transformation group that also preserves the eigenspaces of \u03b3s. This\nis the subgroup of GL(V ) consisting of transformations which preserve the (anti)-automorphism \u03b3 = \u03b3s,\nrather than the structure map s itself. We denote this group by\nGL\u03b3(V ) =\n{\ng \u2208 GL(V ) \u03c6gsg\u22121 = \u03c6s, if \u03b3 = \u03c6s is an automorphism\n\u03c8gsg\u2217 = \u03c8s, if \u03b3 = \u03c8s is an anti-automorphism.\n}\nEquivalently, if \u03c6g(L) = g\n\u22121Lg for L \u2208 gl(V ), then\nGL\u03b3(V ) = {g \u2208 GL(V ) | \u03c6g \u25e6 \u03b3 = \u03b3 \u25e6 \u03c6g} . (1)\nIn this paper we will use the groups GL\u00b11s (V ) in the normal form and unfolding theories. However in\nLemma 3.11 we show that the GL\u03b3(V )-orbit through L \u2208 gl\u00b5(V ) is precisely the intersection of the\nGL(V )-orbit in gl(V ) with gl\u00b5(V ). Thus the difference between the two groups is closely related to the\nphenomenon of orbit splitting. The following proposition describes some of the elementary properties of\nthese transformation groups.\nRemark 3.2 With a slight abuse of notation we define Sl(V ) := {g \u2208 GL(V ) | det g = \u00b11}. Note that\nthe GL(V ) and Sl(V )-orbits through any L are equal. We can therefore always work with the subgroups\nSl\u03c3(\u03b3s)s (V ) = Sl(V ) \u2229GL\u03c3(\u03b3s)s (V ) and Sl\u03b3(V ) = Sl(V ) \u2229GL\u03b3(V ) rather than GL\u03c3(\u03b3s)s (V ) and GL\u03b3(V )\nthemselves.\nProposition 3.7 Let \u03b3 be an (anti)-automorphism of order two on gl(V ) with structure map s. Let\ngl\u00b5(V ) be the eigenspace of \u03b3 with eigenvalue \u00b5.\na) The groups GL\u03c3(\u03b3)s (V ) and GL\u03b3(V ) preserve the eigenspace gl\u00b5(V ).\n10\nb) The Lie algebra of GL\u03c3(\u03b3)s (V ) is the eigenspace gl\u03c3(\u03b3)(V ).\nc) The group Sl\u03c3(\u03b3)s (V ) is equal to either the whole of Sl\u03b3(V ) or to a normal subgroup of index two.\nIf dim V is odd then Sl\u03c3(\u03b3)s (V ) = Sl\u03b3(V ). If \u03b3 is an automorphism then the same results hold with\nGL\u22121s (V ) and GL\u03b3(V ) in place of Sl\n\u22121\ns (V ) and Sl\u03b3(V ).\nParts a) and b) of Proposition 3.7 also hold for (anti)-automorphisms of any finite order.\nExample 3.3 Let \u03c8 be the anti-automorphism L 7\u2192 L\u2217, for which the structure map s is the identity map\nI. Then GL\u22121s (V ) = Sl\n\u22121\ns (V ) = Sl\u03b3(V ) is the group of orthogonal transformations. However GL\u03b3(V ) is\nthe subgroup of GL(V ) consisting of elements g such that gg\u2217 is a scalar multiple of the identity. Thus\npart c) of Proposition 3.7 does not hold with GL\u22121s (V ) and GL\u03b3(V ) in place of Sl\n\u22121\ns (V ) and Sl\u03b3(V ).\u0003\nExample 3.4 Consider the set of infinitesimally R-reversible maps on R2 with R = diag(1,\u22121) and\nlet \u03c6(L) = R\u22121LR. Then Sl+1R (V ) =\n{(\na 0\n0 b\n)\n| ab = \u00b11\n}\nhas two cosets in Sl\u03b3(V ). One coset\nis Sl+1R (V ), the other is hSl\n+1\nR (V ), where h =\n(\n0 1\n1 0\n)\n. In this case it is also true that GL\u03b3(V ) =\nGL+1R (V ) \u222a hGL+1R (V ). \u0003\nProof of Proposition 3.7. The proofs of parts a) and b) are straightforward calculations.\nFor part c) we use the homomorphism \u03c1 : g 7\u2192 \u03b3(g)g\u2212\u03c3(\u03b3) of GL(V ). The characterization in equation\n(1) implies that for every element g \u2208 GL\u03b3(V ) the element \u03c1(g) = \u03b3(g)g\u2212\u03c3(\u03b3) commutes with every\nlinear map L \u2208 gl(V ) and so must be a real nonzero scalar multiple of the identity, \u03b3(g)g\u2212\u03c3(\u03b3) = \u03bbI,\nsay. Let n = dimV . Then taking determinants, and noting that det \u03b3(g) = det g, implies that \u03bbn = 1 for\nautomorphisms and \u03bbn = (det g)2 for anti-automorphisms. It follows that \u03bb = \u00b11 for any g \u2208 GL\u03b3(V )\nif \u03b3 is an automorphisms, and for g \u2208 Sl\u03b3(V ) if \u03b3 is an anti-automorphism. Hence \u03c1 takes values in\nZ2 = {\u00b1I}. If n is odd then \u03bb = 1 in both cases and \u03c1 is the constant mapping to the identity. The\nresults now follow. 2\n3.3 Reduction\nWe will now reduce to the semi-simple case using a method analogous to that described in Section 2.1.\nThe next lemma follows almost immediately from Lemma 2.2.\nLemma 3.8 (Reduction Lemma)\nLet L be a map in gl\u00b5(V ) = {A \u2208 gl(V ) | \u03b3s(A) = \u00b5A}, where \u03b3s is an (anti)-automorphism of order\ntwo with structure map s. Furthermore let L = S + N be the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition and let\nV\u03bb be an indecomposable L-invariant subspace. Then there exists an indecomposable s-invariant subspace\nX\u03bb = V\u03bb+ sV\u03bb. Furthermore for each X\u03bb there exists an S-invariant complement Y\u03bb of NX\u03bb in X\u03bb such\nthat X\u03bb = Y\u03bb \u2295NX\u03bb = Y\u03bb \u2295NY\u03bb \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295Nn\u22121Y\u03bb. If S is given on Y\u03bb, then L is determined on X\u03bb up\nto similarity.\nOn Y\u03bb we have a reduced (anti)-automorphism. For automorphisms it is easy to see that the reduction\nof \u03c6s is simply \u03c6s restricted to Y\u03bb so that Y\u03bb =W\u03bb + sW\u03bb. Since Y\u03bb is s-invariant, the normal form of s\non X\u03bb follows from the normal form of s restricted to Y\u03bb.\nRemark 3.5 Either V\u03bb\u2229 sV\u03bb = {0} or V\u03bb \u2229 sV\u03bb = V\u03bb. For example for infinitesimally R-reversible maps\nwe have X\u00b1i\u03b2 = V\u00b1i\u03b2 , but X\u03b1 = V\u03b1 \u2295RV\u03b1 = V\u03b1 \u2295 V\u2212\u03b1. \u0003\nFor anti-automorphisms the situation is somewhat more complicated. Recall that an anti-automorphism\ncomes from a non-degenerate bilinear form \u03c9 which is either symmetric or anti-symmetric, \u03c9(y, x) =\n\u03b5\u03c9(x, y) with \u03b5 = \u00b11. Then on X\u03bb the map L satisfies \u03c9(Lx, y) = \u00b5\u03c9(x, Ly). On Y\u03bb we have a reduced\nform.\n11\nLemma 3.9 Let L = S + N be the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition of L \u2208 gl\u00b5(V ) on the indecom-\nposable s-invariant subspace X\u03bb. Let Y\u03bb be an S-invariant complement to NX\u03bb in X\u03bb. Then \u03c4(x, y) =\n\u03c9(x,Nn\u22121y) is a non-degenerate bilinear form on Y\u03bb with \u03c4(y, x) = \u03b5\u00b5\nn\u22121\u03c4(x, y). Furthermore \u03c4(Sx, y) =\n\u00b5\u03c4(x, Sy).\nSee Appendix A for a proof. The reduced anti-automorphism is \u03c8t where the structure map t is defined\nby \u03c4(x, y) = \u3008x, ty\u3009Y for all x, y \u2208 Y = Y\u03bb. Then Y\u03bb = W\u03bb + tW\u03bb. Here Y\u03bb is not s-invariant.\nHowever the freedom in choosing Y\u03bb can be used to put s into a normal form with respect to the splitting\nX\u03bb = Y\u03bb \u2295NY\u03bb \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295Nn\u22121Y\u03bb, again see Appendix A.\nNow we obtain an unfolding lemma which uses the GL(V )-unfolding from Lemma 2.5 as a starting point.\nLemma 3.10 (Unfolding Lemma)\nLet \u03b3 be an (anti)-automorphism and let L \u2208 gl\u00b5(V ). Then the restriction of the GL(V ) centralizer\nunfolding of L in gl(V ) to gl\u00b5(V ) is equivalent to the GL\n\u03c3(\u03b3)\ns (V ) centralizer unfolding in gl\u00b5(V ).\nProof. Let L \u2208 gl\u00b5(V ) and let TGL(V ) = {UL \u2212 LU | U \u2208 gl(V )} be the tangent space at L to the\nGL(V )-orbit of L. Let NGL(V ) be its orthogonal complement with respect to an inner product on gl(V ).\nTo simplify notation let G = GL\u03c3(\u03b3)s (V ) and g = gl\u03c3(\u03b3)(V ). Then TG = {UL \u2212 LU | U \u2208 g} is the\ntangent space at L to the G-orbit of L. Let NG be its orthogonal complement in gl\u00b5(V ). By shifting\nL to the origin in gl(V ) we have gl(V ) = TGL(V ) \u2295\u22a5 NGL(V ) and gl\u00b5(V ) = TG \u2295\u22a5 NG. Now let \u03a0\nbe the orthogonal projection onto gl\u00b5(V ). Then \u03a0(TGL(V )) = {UL \u2212 LU | U \u2208 gl(V ), \u03b3(UL \u2212 LU) =\n\u00b5(UL\u2212 LU)} = {UL\u2212 LU | U \u2208 g} = TG, since \u03b3(UL\u2212 LU) = \u00b5(UL\u2212 LU) iff U \u2208 g, and\ngl\u00b5(V ) = \u03a0(gl(V )) = \u03a0(TGL(V ) \u2295\u22a5 NGL(V )) = \u03a0(TGL(V ))\u2295\u22a5 \u03a0(NGL(V )) = TG \u2295\u22a5 \u03a0(NGL(V )).\nSince orthogonal complements are unique, we have \u03a0(NGL(V )) = NG. 2\n3.4 Orbit Splitting\nThe transformation groupGL\u03b3(V ) preserves gl\u00b5(V ) as a linear space and so mapsGL\n\u03c3(\u03b3)\ns (V )-orbits into\nGL\u03c3(\u03b3)s (V )-orbits. The difference between the groups GL\u03b3(V ) and GL\n\u03c3(\u03b3)\ns (V ) gives rise to splitting of\norbits. This means that a GL(V )-orbit in gl(V ) splits into different GL\u03c3(\u03b3)s (V )-orbits when intersected\nwith gl\u00b5(V ). In particular orbit splitting implies that eigenvalues and Jordan structure no longer suffice\nto characterize GL\u03c3(\u03b3)s (V )-orbits. Examples of additional invariants are symplectic and reversible signs\n[6, 14].\nLemma 3.11 (Intersection Lemma)\nLet V be an indecomposable s-invariant space and \u03b3s an (anti)-automorphism of order two with structure\nmap s. Let L \u2208 gl\u00b5(V ). Then\nOrbGL(V )(L) \u2229 gl\u00b5(V ) = OrbGL\u03b3(V )(L).\nProof. If M \u2208 OrbGL\u03b3(V )(L) then clearly M \u2208 OrbGL(V )(L) \u2229 gl\u00b5(V ). Next we assume M \u2208\nOrbGL(V )(L) \u2229 gl\u00b5(V ). The GL(V )-orbits of L and M are, of course, the same. From the Orbit\nLemma 3.6 we know that the GL\u03c3(\u03b3)s (V )-orbits of L and M correspond to the GL(V )-orbits of the pairs\n(L, s) and (M, s). These orbits are not necessarily the same. From the GL(V )-classification of pairs\nin Section 4 we see that the normal form of (L, s) is either (L0, s0) or (L0, \u03b5s0) with \u03b5 = \u00b11. That is\neither eigenvalues and Jordan structure determine the orbit or there is an additional sign. In that case\n(L0, s0) and (L0,\u2212s0) are not equivalent, there exists no g \u2208 GL(V ) such that g.(L0, s0) = (L0,\u2212s0).\nThe normal form of (M, s) is (L0, \u03b5s0) and in the absence of a sign we set \u03b5 = 1. If there is no sign\nthen there are g1, g2 \u2208 GL(V ) such that g1.(L, s) = (L0, s0) and g2.(M, s) = (M0, s0). But then we have\n(M, s) = g\u221212 g1.(L, s) and thus g\n\u22121\n2 g1 \u2208 GL\u03c3(\u03b3)s (V ) \u2282 GL\u03b3(V ). If there is a sign we perform the same\ncomputation to find g1, g2 \u2208 GL(V ) such that (M, s) = g\u221212 g1.(L, \u03b5s) and thus g\u221212 g1 \u2208 GL\u03b3(V ). Hence\nwe may conclude that M \u2208 OrbGL\u03b3(V )(L). 2\nThe following result is an immediate corollary of Proposition 3.7 and Lemma 3.11.\n12\nTheorem 3.12 (Orbit Splitting Theorem)\nIf L \u2208 gl\u00b5(V ) then the GL(V )-orbit of L in gl(V ) intersects gl\u00b5(V ) in at most two GL\u03c3(\u03b3)s (V )-orbits.\nExample 3.6 Recall from Example 1.1 that the space of infinitesimally R-reversible maps is defined by\ngl\u2212R(V ) := {L \u2208 gl(V ) | \u03c6R(L) = \u2212L}, where \u03c6R is an automorphism defined by \u03c6R(L) := R\u22121LR\nwith structure map R satisfying R2 = I, R 6= \u00b1I. The structure map R has eigenvalues +1 and \u22121 with\ncorresponding eigenspaces E+ = {a \u2208 V | Ra = a} and E\u2212 = {b \u2208 V | Rb = \u2212b}. For an infinitesimally\nR-reversible map L we have LE+ \u2286 E\u2212 and LE\u2212 \u2286 E+. Let V be an indecomposable L,R-invariant\nsubspace. Then eigenvectors of L for eigenvalue zero either belong to E+ or to E\u2212. The new invariant,\ncalled the reversible sign indicates to which eigenspace such an eigenvector belongs. \u0003\nExample 3.7 Infinitesimally symplectic linear maps are defined by sp(V ) := {L \u2208 gl(V ) | \u03c9(Lx, y) +\n\u03c9(x, Ly) = 0, \u2200x, y \u2208 V }, where \u03c9 is a non-degenerate skew symmetric bilinear form on V , see Example\n1.2. With help of an inner product \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009 on V we can find a map J satisfying J\u2217 = \u2212J and J2 = \u2212I such\nthat \u03c9(x, y) = \u3008x, Jy\u3009. Then sp(V ) = {L \u2208 gl(V ) | \u03c8J (L) = \u2212L}, where \u03c8J is the anti-automorphism\ndefined by \u03c8J (L) := J\n\u22121L\u2217J . Here J is the structure map. Since gl\u03c3(\u03c8J )(V ) = gl\u22121(V ) = sp(V ),\nProposition 3.7 says that sp(V ) is a Lie algebra, as we already knew. The invertible transformations that\npreserve the symplectic structure are exactly those g for which \u03c9(gx, gy) = \u03c9(x, y). Indeed according\nto Proposition 3.7 they are given by GL1(V ) = {g \u2208 GL(V ) | \u03c8J (g) = g\u22121}, which is equivalent to\ng\u2217Jg = J , reflecting the transformation rule for bilinear forms. The order of \u03c8J is two. So if splitting of\nan orbit occurs there are at most two inequivalent normal forms. A well known example is the distinction\nbetween 1:1 resonance and 1:-1 resonance. In both cases there are double eigenvalues \u00b1i. But there is an\nadditional invariant, namely a symplectic sign distinguishing the two cases. These signs are intimately\nrelated to the Morse index of the corresponding quadratic Hamilton functions. In Hamiltonian systems\na single pair of complex conjugate imaginary eigenvalues is forced to remain on the imaginary axis when\nparameters of the system vary. When two such pairs meet they may remain on the imaginary axis,\nwhich is called passing or they may move into the complex plane which is called splitting. Computing\nthe unfoldings in the 1:1 case one finds passing of imaginary eigenvalues (see Cotter [7], Galin [12] and\nKoc\u00b8ak [19]), which is a codimension three phenomenon, see table 5 type 8d. In the 1:-1 case one finds\nsplitting of imaginary eigenvalues (see van der Meer [21]), which is a codimension one phenomenon, see\ntable 5 type 8c. \u0003\n4 Normal Forms and Examples of Unfoldings\n4.1 Normal Forms\nIn the present setting, where \u03b3s is an (anti)-automorphism of order two with structure map s, we can\nclassify maps satisfying \u03b3s(L) = \u00b5L into the eight different types listed in Table 1.\nApplying the Reduction Lemma 3.8 it is straightforward to obtain normal forms for semi-simple maps\nof the types listed in Table 1. If \u03b3s is an anti-automorphism we apply the construction of Appendix\nA to put the structure map s into normal form. Finally we reduce to the smaller space Y on which\nwe consider the semi-simple part S of L and the reduced structure map t (see Appendix A), such that\nS \u2208 gl\u00b5(Y ) = {A \u2208 gl(Y ) | \u03b3t(A) = \u00b5A}. Since we consider semi-simple maps in their own right we\ndenote the reduced structure map again by s. Note that in view of the Orbit Lemma 3.6 the normal\nforms in Tables 2 and 3 can be regarded as representatives of GL\u03c3(\u03b3)s (Y )-orbits of S once a choice for s\nhas been made, but they can also be seen as representatives of GL(Y )-orbits of the pair (S, s).\nTheorem 4.1 (Normal Form Theorem)\nLet \u03b3s be an (anti)-automorphism of order two with structure map s and let L \u2208 gl\u00b5(X) be a linear map\nin one of the eigenspaces of \u03b3s, where X is an indecomposable (L, s)-invariant space. Furthermore let\nL = S +N be the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition of L. Then the normal form of L on X is determined\nby the normal form of S on Y , where Y \u2282 X is a reduced space as in Proposition 3.8. The normal forms\nof S are listed in Tables 2 and 3.\nRemarks 4.1 Let us make some remarks on the various cases in Tables 2 and 3.\n13\ntype \u03b3s s\n\u2217 \u00b5 L\n1 \u03c6s s 1 s-equivariant of type R\n2 \u03c6s s \u22121 s-reversible of type R\n3 \u03c6s \u2212s 1 s-equivariant of type C or C-linear\n4 \u03c6s \u2212s \u22121 s-reversible of type C or C-semi-linear\n5 \u03c8s s 1 symmetric\n6 \u03c8s s \u22121 anti-symmetric\n7 \u03c8s \u2212s 1 anti-symplectic\n8 \u03c8s \u2212s \u22121 symplectic\nTable 1: Eight types of maps satisfying \u03b3s(L) = \u00b5L, when \u03b3s is an (anti)-automorphism of order two.\n1. There are only two cases where there are no signs at all, namely infinitesimally s-reversible semi-\nsimple maps of type C and anti-symplectic semi-simple maps.\n2. In each of the other cases the sign has a geometric meaning. Let S be a semi-simple map in an\neigenspace of an automorphism, see Table 1.\n(a) For s-equivariant maps of type R there are two isotypic components, labelled by the eigenvalues\nof s. The sign indicates on which of the two isotypic components L acts. Similarly for s-\nequivariant maps of type C. Here the sign disappears for real eigenvalues of L. The latter are\nforced to be double and are non-generic.\n(b) For infinitesimally s-reversible maps of type R the sign for zero eigenvalues of L indicates to\nwhich eigenspace of s the corresponding eigenvector belongs.\n(c) In case of symmetric and anti-symmetric maps the sign is related to the signature of the\nunderlying bilinear form. If the signature is denoted by (p, q), that is\n\u3008x, y\u3009 =\np\u2211\ni=1\nxi yi \u2212\nq\u2211\ni=1\nxp+i yp+i,\nthen for signature (n, 0) or (0, n), symmetric maps only have real eigenvalues whereas anti-\nsymmetric maps only have imaginary eigenvalues. In this case the sign distinguishes between\n(n, 0) and (0, n).\n(d) For infinitesimally symplectic maps the structure map itself is symplectic. The dynamical\ninterpretation is that the structure map defines a preferred direction of rotation. This gives a\nsign for imaginary eigenvalues of an infinitesimally symplectic map.\n3. In case of types 3 and 4 the structure map s satisfies s\u2217 = \u2212s and s2 = \u2212I. Therefore s defines a\ncomplex structure on X . Maps of type 3 commute with s, but maps of type 4 anti-commute with\ns. Consequently maps of type 3 can be considered as C-linear maps whereas maps of type 4 can be\nconsidered as C-semi-linear maps.\n4. In case of anti-automorphisms the reduced structure map t can be either symmetric or skew in\neigenspaces with \u00b5 = \u22121. This means that a reduced semi-simple infinitesimally symplectic map\nis either infinitesimally symplectic or anti-symmetric with respect to the reduced structure map.\nSimilarly a reduced semi-simple anti-symmetric map is either anti-symmetric or infinitesimally\nsymplectic. \u0003\nWe conclude this section with a proof of the Normal Form Theorem.\nProof of Theorem 4.1. We will not give proofs for all the different cases for they are very similar to\neach other. Instead we give some representative proofs for automorphisms and anti-automorphisms with\n14\ntype \u03bb Y\u03bb s S remarks\n1 \u03b1 W\u03b1 \u00b11 \u03b1 sign\n1 \u03b1\u00b1 i\u03b2 W\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2 \u00b1I2\n(\n\u03b1 \u2212\u03b2\n\u03b2 \u03b1\n)\nsign, \u03b2 > 0\n2 0 W0 \u00b11 0 sign\n2 \u00b1\u03b1 W\u03b1 \u2295W\u2212\u03b1 T\n(\n\u03b1 0\n0 \u2212\u03b1\n)\n\u03b1 > 0\n2 \u00b1i\u03b2 W\u00b1i\u03b2 R\n(\n0 \u2212\u03b2\n\u03b2 0\n)\n\u03b2 > 0\n2 \u00b1\u03b1\u00b1 i\u03b2 W\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2 \u2295W\u2212\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2\n(\n0 I2\nI2 0\n) \uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u03b1 \u2212\u03b2\n\u03b2 \u03b1\n\u2212\u03b1 \u03b2\n\u2212\u03b2 \u2212\u03b1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 \u03b1 > 0, \u03b2 > 0\n3 \u03b1\u00b1 i\u03b2 W\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2 \u00b1J\n(\n\u03b1 \u2212\u03b2\n\u03b2 \u03b1\n)\nsign, \u03b2 \u2265 0\n4 \u00b1\u03b1 W\u03b1 \u2295W\u2212\u03b1 J\n(\n\u03b1 0\n0 \u2212\u03b1\n)\n\u03b1 \u2265 0\n4 \u00b1\u03b1\u00b1 i\u03b2 W\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2 \u2295W\u2212\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2\n(\n0 \u2212I2\nI2 0\n) \uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u03b1 \u2212\u03b2\n\u03b2 \u03b1\n\u2212\u03b1 \u03b2\n\u2212\u03b2 \u2212\u03b1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 \u03b1 \u2265 0, \u03b2 > 0\nTable 2: Normal forms for semi-simple maps S in the eigenspace of an automorphism \u03c6s.

In the\ncharacterization of the structure map s we the standard matrices I, I2, R, T and J as in the proof of\nTheorem 4.1. The signs in the tables indicate that the normal forms for +1 and \u22121 are inequivalent.\nSince in each case there are at most two possibilities this shows that orbit splitting occurs as stated in\nTheorem 3.12. The relevance of the signs becomes most obvious when constructing unfoldings. We put\nthe sign in the structure map s, but for nonzero eigenvalues we can also put the sign in the map S.\nand without signs. The types refer to Table 1. We use the following standard matrices.\nI = I2 =\n(\n1 0\n0 1\n)\n, R =\n(\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n)\n, T =\n(\n0 1\n1 0\n)\n, J =\n(\n0 \u22121\n1 0\n)\n.\n1. Type 3; complex eigenvalues; s2 = \u2212I.

Then the sign of s changes as well. Therefore we\nassume \u03b2 > 0 and put the sign in s = \u00b1J .\n2. Type 4; real eigenvalues; s2 = \u2212I. The maps S and s anti-commute. If e \u2208 W\u03b1 then se \u2208 W\u2212\u03b1,\nso Y\u03b1 = W\u03b1 \u2295W\u2212\u03b1. Then \u3008e, se\u3009 is a basis of Y\u03b1 and we have S = \u03b1R and s = J . Note that\nsSs\u22121 = \u2212S, so we may assume that \u03b1 \u2265 0. There is no sign in this case.\n3. Type 5; complex eigenvalues; s2 = I. Here Y\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2 =W\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2 . Let e be any vector in Y\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2 and define\nf := 1\n\u03b2\n(S \u2212 \u03b1)e. Then \u3008e, f\u3009 is a basis of Y\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2 . On this basis S = \u03b1I + \u03b2J . Let \u03c4 be the reduced\nform on Y\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2 , that is \u03c4(x, y) = \u3008x, sy\u3009. Then indeed \u03c4(e, f) = 1\u03b2 (e, Se) = 1\u03b2 (Se, e) = \u03c4(f, e). If u\nis a vector in Y\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2 such that su = u, then s(S \u2212 \u03b1)u = \u2212(S \u2212 \u03b1)su = \u2212(S \u2212 \u03b1)u. So s is indeed\nsymmetric and has eigenvalues \u00b11 on Y\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2 .

Note that sSs\u22121 = \u03b1I \u2212 \u03b2J ,\nso we may assume \u03b2 \u2265 0 and there is no sign.\n4. Type 6; imaginary eigenvalues; s2 = I. Again Y\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2 = W\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2 . Let e be any vector in Y\u00b1i\u03b2 and\ndefine f := 1\n\u03b2\nSe. Then \u3008e, f\u3009 is a basis of Y\u00b1i\u03b2 . On this basis S = \u03b2J . The reduced form \u03c4 on Y\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2\nis symmetric, so \u03c4(e, f) = \u03c4(f, e). On the other hand \u03c4(e, f) = 1\n\u03b2\n\u03c4(e, Se) = \u2212 1\n\u03b2\n\u03c4(Se, e) = \u2212\u03c4(f, e),\nso \u03c4(e, f) = 0. Furthermore \u03c4(f, f) = 1\n\u03b22\n\u03c4(Se, Se) = \u2212 1\n\u03b22\n\u03c4(S2e, e) = \u03c4(e, e). Thus on the basis\n\u3008e, f\u3009 we have S = \u03b2J , s = \u00b1I and we may assume that \u03b2 > 0. 2\n4.2 Examples of Unfoldings\nOur aim is to present a list of low codimension unfoldings. We will concentrate on unfoldings of zero\neigenvalues. Since such unfoldings give a parametrization of the full space of maps we also get information\non the unfoldings of real, imaginary and complex eigenvalues. The classification is complete up to\ncodimension two. Where appropriate we include some higher codimension cases to show the consequences\nof signs. In constructing unfoldings we use Lemmas 3.10 and 2.5 and we summarize the results in a\n16\ntheorem.\nTheorem 4.2 (Unfolding Theorem)\nLet \u03b3s be an (anti)-automorphism of order two with structure map s and let L \u2208 gl\u00b5(X) be a linear map,\nwith X an indecomposable (L, s)-invariant space. Furthermore let L = S + N be the Jordan-Chevalley\ndecomposition of L. Then the unfoldings of L up to codimension two are listed in Tables 4 and 5.\nHere we consider real maps with real parameters. In such maps simple real eigenvalues are forced to remain\non the real axis when parameters are varied. Maps which are elements of an eigenspace corresponding to\neigenvalue \u22121 of an (anti)-automorphism have eigenvalues which come in complex conjugate (\u03bb, \u03bb\u00af) and\nopposite (\u03bb,\u2212\u03bb) pairs. Thus a pair of simple opposite imaginary eigenvalues is forced to remain on the\nimaginary axis when parameters are varied. However there may also be collisions of such eigenvalues on\nthe real or imaginary axis as the parameter varies. Generically eigenvalues split into the complex plane\nat collisions, but in the presence of signs generic passing also occurs.\nThere are several examples where we have passing or splitting depending on the signs. In s-equivariant\nmaps of type R, type 1 in Table 1, passing of real eigenvalues with different signs and splitting of real\neigenvalues with equal signs are both codimension one phenomena. This can be inferred from 1c and\n1d in Table 4. In infinitesimally s-reversible maps of type R, type 2 in Table 1, only zero eigenvalues\nare signed. At collisions real and imaginary eigenvalues generically split. Maps of type 3 generically do\nnot have eigenvalues on the real or imaginary axis. Maps of type 4 generically do have opposite pairs of\nreal eigenvalues, but since there are no signs they split at collisions. Real eigenvalues of maps of type 5\nwith equal signs pass but split when the signs are different at collisions. This follows from 5b, 5c and\n5d in Table 5. Similarly imaginary eigenvalues of anti-symmetric maps of type 6 split or pass when the\nsigns are different or equal respectively. See 6e and 6f in Table 5. Note that passing is a codimension 3\nphenomenon, but splitting is a codimension 1 phenomenon. This should come as no surprise because the\nanti-symmetric maps are closely related to infinitesimally symplectic maps of type 8. Here we have the\nsame codimensions for splitting and passing, see 8c and 8d in Table 5. Maps of type 7 can generically\nhave real eigenvalues. Since there are no signs they generically split at collisions.\n5 Generalizations\nHere we will generalize the results for a single (anti)-automorphism of order two to an abelian group \u0393\nof (anti)-automorphisms of order two. In general the subset g in the Introduction will be an isotypic\ncomponent of the action of \u0393 on gl(V ), but for abelian groups these are equivalent to simultaneous\neigenspaces. To make this more precise, let the V be a finite dimensional real vector space and let \u0393\nbe a abelian group of (anti)-automorphisms of order two acting on gl(V ). Suppose \u0393 is generated by\n\u3008\u03b31, . . . , \u03b3p\u3009 with \u03b32i = I for i = 1, . . . , p. Then the simultaneous eigenspaces are given by\ngl\u00b51,...,\u00b5p(V ) = {L \u2208 gl(V ) | \u03b31(L) = \u00b51L, . . . , \u03b3p(L) = \u00b5pL},\nwhere the eigenvalues \u00b5i are \u00b11. The structure map associated to \u03b3i is denoted by si. Apart from\nExample 1.3 we encounter this situation with infinitesimally reversible equivariant and infinitesimally\nsymplectic reversible equivariant maps. See [15] for applications of the results of this article.\nThe theory developed for a single (anti)-automorphism almost immediately extends to an abelian group\nof (anti)-automorphisms. Let us review Section 3 and make some comments. The structure maps can\nagain be taken orthogonal, but here we need to take a closer look at anti-automorphisms, see Appendix B.\nFrom the proof of Proposition 3.5 it follows immediately that the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition also\nholds in gl\u00b51,...,\u00b5p(V ). Moreover the structure preserving transformation group G is the intersection of\nthe structure preserving transformations groups for each (anti)-automorphism \u03b3i. Once we have identified\nthe transformation group we can classify its orbits in gl\u00b51,...,\u00b5p(V ). There is a Reduction Lemma similar\nto 3.8 where indecomposable s-invariant subspaces are replaced by indecomposable s1, . . . , sp-invariant\nsubspaces. In the same way we have an Unfolding Lemma and an Orbit Splitting Theorem for \u0393. But in\nthe latter we now have at most 2p inequivalent G-orbits.\nRemark 5.1 The indecomposable s1, . . . , sp-invariant subspaces can be relatively large. Let us look\nat an H-linear map on R4. The quaternionic structure on R4 is determined by two structure maps c\n17\nand q with c2 = \u2212I, q2 = \u2212I and cq = \u2212qc, see [15]. Then H-linear maps on R4 are defined as\ngl1,1(R\n4) := {A \u2208 gl(R4) | \u03c6c(A) = A, \u03c6q(A) = A}, where \u03c6c(A) := c\u22121Ac and \u03c6q(A) := q\u22121Aq. Here\n\u0393 = {I, \u03c6c, \u03c6q, \u03c6c \u25e6 \u03c6q} since clearly \u03c6c and \u03c6q commute. Let L \u2208 gl\u22121,\u22121(R4) have a real eigenvalue \u03b1,\nthen the indecomposable L, c,q-invariant space is X\u03b1 = V\u03b1 \u2295 cV\u03b1 \u2295 qV\u03b1 \u2295 cqV\u03b1. \u0003\nExample 5.2 The maximum number of 2p inequivalent G-orbits occurs in an example of an infinitesi-\nmally reversible symplectic linear map. We have already encountered such maps in Example 1.3. They are\nelements of the simultaneous eigenspace gl\u22121,\u22121(R\n2n) := {A \u2208 gl(R2n) | \u03c6R(A) = \u2212A, \u03c8J(A) = \u2212A},\nwhere \u03c6R(A) := R\n\u22121AR and \u03c8J(A) := J\n\u22121A\u2217J . Here \u0393 = {id, \u03c6R, \u03c8J , \u03c8RJ} is generated by \u03c6R and \u03c8J ,\nwhere \u03c8J \u25e6 \u03c6R = \u03c8RJ . Let L be a map in gl\u22121,\u22121(R4) with two blocks of double zero eigenvalues and a\nnilpotent part of height two, see [14]. Then there are 4 = 22 inequivalent G-orbits in gl\u22121,\u22121(R\n4). \u0003\nAs mentioned in the Introduction our main motivation for studying eigenspaces of (anti)-automorphisms\nof order two comes from real ordinary differential equations. Other obvious generalizations apart from\nthe one given in this section are not necessarily in this context. Such generalizations include single\n(anti)-automorphisms of finite order. Then the eigenspace gl\u00b5(V ) need not be real. This problem can be\novercome by taking the real invariant space gl\u00b5,\u00b5\u00af(V ) as the object of study, though one could also look\nat the complex space gl\u00b5(V ) in its own right. One could also look at abelian and non-abelian groups\ngenerated by (anti)-automorphisms of finite order, and more generally still one might consider general\ncompact groups of (anti)-automorphisms. We will not pursue these matters here.\nAcknowledgments\nIt is a great pleasure to thank Richard Cushman for valuable comments and discussions. This research\nwas supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council EPSRC (IH, JSWL), the\nNuffield Foundation (JSWL), and by European Community funding for the Research Training Network\n\u2018MASIE\u2019 (HPRN-CT-2000-00113).\nA Standard Form of a Bilinear Form\nHere we generalize a result of Burgoyne & Cushman [4, 5], which in turn is based on a theorem of Springer\n& Steinberg [28], to obtain a normal form for a skew or indefinite symmetric bilinear form on V which\nrespects the splitting of V in the Reduction Lemma 3.8.\nLet V be real vector space and let \u03c9 be a nondegenerate bilinear form on V which is either symmetric\nor skew, that is for each nonzero x \u2208 V there exists an y \u2208 V such that \u03c9(x, y) 6= 0 and for all x, y \u2208 V ,\n\u03c9(y, x) = \u03b5\u03c9(x, y) with \u03b5 = \u00b11. If \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009 is the standard inner product on V then there is an invertible\nlinear map s with s\u2217 = \u03b5s such that \u03c9(x, y) = \u3008x, sy\u3009. We may assume that after scaling s2 = \u03b5I, so s is\northogonal.\nLet L be a linear map on V such that for all x, y \u2208 V , \u03c9(Lx, y) = \u00b5\u03c9(x, Ly) with \u00b5 = \u00b11. This is\nequivalent to \u3008Lx, sy\u3009 = \u00b5\u3008x, sLy\u3009 or L\u2217s = \u00b5sL. Let \u03c8s(L) = s\u22121L\u2217s. Then L satisfies \u03c8s(L) = \u00b5L.\nNow we assume that V is an indecomposable L,s-invariant space. If L = S +N is the Jordan-Chevalley\ndecomposition of L then there is an S-invariant complement W of NV in V such that V =W \u2295NW \u2295\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Nn\u22121W , where n is the height of N . Although s has a normal form as in Lemma 3.3, since s is\northogonal, we wish to find a normal form of s which respects the above splitting of V .\nIf \u03c9 is definite then it must be symmetric and thus s = \u00b1I. Then every L satisfying \u03c8s(L) = \u00b5L is\nsemi-simple. Therefore in the present situation we need only consider indefinite forms. The main result\nof this section can now be stated.\nProposition A.1 Let \u03c9 and L be de\ufb01ned as above. For every S-invariant complement W1 of NV in V\nthere is an invertible transformation g such that W = gW1 is again S-invariant and on W \u2295NW \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2295\n18\nNn\u22121W the matrix of s takes the form \uf8eb\n\uf8ed \u2217. . .\n\u2217\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 ,\nwhere \u2217 is a m\u00d7m block and m = dimW .\nThe procedure to transformW1 runs as follows. Note that the matrix of s is upper triangular with respect\nto the main anti-diagonal. Furthermore blocks of s on an anti-diagonal differ only by a sign, see the proof\nof Proposition A.1 below. By adding a component of NW1 to W1 and setting W2 = W1 + Ng1W1 for\na map g1 to be specified later, we clear the first co-anti-diagonal. Then we set W3 = W2 + N\n2g2W2,\nclearing the second co-anti-diagonal without affecting the first. This process stops after n\u2212 1 steps.\nThe following lemmas are useful in the proof of Proposition A.1. Although there is freedom in choosing\nan S-invariant complement W of NV in V the space Nn\u22121W is unique.\nLemma A.2 If W is an S-invariant complement W of NV in V , then Nn\u22121W is unique.\nProof. Let n be the height of N on V . For every x \u2208 Nn\u22121W we have Nx = 0. Since the eigenspaces\nof N are unique Nn\u22121W is unique. Thus if U is also an S-invariant complement W of NV in V then\nNn\u22121U = Nn\u22121W . 2\nThe matrix of s with respect to a basis in V =W \u2295NW \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295Nn\u22121W has the following properties.\nLemma A.3 Let \u03c9(x, y) = \u3008x, sy\u3009V and blocks of s are denoted by \u03b2ij . Then \u03b2i,j = \u00b5\u03b2i\u22121,j+1 and\n\u03b2ij = 0 if i+ j \u2265 n.\nProof. This follows immediately from \u03c9(N ix,N jy) = \u00b5\u03c9(N i\u22121x,N j+1y) = \u00b5i\u03c9(x,N i+jy). 2\nIn the proof of the proposition we need the bilinear forms \u03c4j(x, y) = \u03c9(N\njx, y) on W for j = 1, . . . , n\u22121.\nFurthermore let Tj be defined as \u03c4j(x, y) = \u3008x, Tjy\u3009W for all x, y \u2208W .\nLemma A.4 Tn\u22121 is an invertible map.\nProof. This follows from the fact that \u03c4n\u22121 is nondegenerate on W . The form \u03c9 is nondegenerate on\nV , so for every nonzero x \u2208 V there is a y \u2208 V such that \u03c9(x, y) 6= 0. In particular for every x \u2208 W\nthere is a y \u2208 V such that \u03c9(Nn\u22121x, y) 6= 0. Every such y has a unique decomposition y = y1 + y2 with\ny1 \u2208 W and y2 \u2208 NV . Then 0 6= \u03c9(Nn\u22121x, y) = \u00b5n\u22121\u03c9(x,Nn\u22121y) = \u00b5n\u22121\u03c9(x,Nn\u22121y1 + Nn\u22121y2) =\n\u00b5n\u22121\u03c9(x,Nn\u22121y1). Thus \u03c4n\u22121 is nondegenerate on W and therefore Tn\u22121 is invertible on W . 2\nProof of Proposition A.1. Note that the blocks \u03b2ij differ from the matrices of Tj\u22121 by a sign only.\nTherefore if the bilinear forms \u03c4j are identically zero onW for j = 1, n\u22122, the matrix of s has the desired\nform.\nSuppose \u03c4n\u22122 6= 0 onW . LetW2 =W1+NgW1 where g is chosen so that \u03c4n\u22122((I+Ng)x, (I+Ng)y) = 0\nfor all x, y \u2208 W1. After a short computation we find \u03c4n\u22122(x + Ngx, y + Ngy) = \u3008x, (Tn\u22122 + \u00b5Tn\u22121g +\ng\u2217Tn\u22121)y\u3009W . Assuming that g\u2217Tn\u22121 = \u00b5Tn\u22121g we set g = \u2212 12\u00b5T\u22121n\u22121Tn\u22122. Then \u03c4n\u22122 = 0 on W2.\nNow assume that \u03c4n\u22122 = 0, . . . , \u03c4n\u2212j+1 = 0 on Wj\u22121. Let Wj = Wj\u22121 +N\nj\u22121gWj\u22121, where g is chosen\nso that \u03c4n\u2212j((I +N\nj\u22121g)x, (I +N j\u22121g)y) = 0 for all x, y \u2208 Wj\u22121. Again we find \u03c4n\u2212j(x +N j\u22121gx, y +\nN j\u22121gy) = \u3008x, (Tn\u2212j + \u00b5j\u22121Tn\u22121g + g\u2217Tn\u22121)y\u3009W and we set g = \u2212 12\u00b5j\u22121T\u22121n\u22121Tn\u2212j , so that \u03c4n\u2212j = 0 on\nWj . It is easily checked that now \u03c4n\u22122 = 0, . . . , \u03c4n\u2212j = 0 on Wj .\nWe still have to check that g\u2217Tn\u22121 = \u00b5\nj\u22121Tn\u22121g in each step, but this follows from T\n\u2217\nn\u2212jTn\u22121 =\n\u00b5j\u22121Tn\u22121Tn\u2212j because N\n\u2217Tn\u22121 = \u00b5Tn\u22121N . Furthermore it is easy to see that each Wj is S-invariant.2\nB Orthogonality of Structure Maps\nIn this appendix we give a precise statement of the properties of structure maps associated to the gener-\nators of an abelian group \u0393 of (anti)-automorphisms of order two. Their properties are essentially those\n19\nof a structure map of a single (anti)-automorphism, but it is not a priori clear that we can transform\nthem as in Proposition 3.3 so that they can all be assumed to be orthogonal. It might happen that\na transformation which takes one structure map in good shape spoils another. The proposition below\nshows that this does not happen because of the commutation relations of the (anti)-automorphisms.\nProposition B.1 Let \u0393 be a abelian group of (anti)-automorphisms of order two on gl(V ) generated by\n\u3008\u03b31, . . . , \u03b3p\u3009. Then we may assume that \u03b3i = \u03b3si where the structure maps si have the following properties:\na) det si = \u00b11.\nb) si is orthogonal.\nc) s2i = \u00b1I.\nd) sisj = \u00b1sjsi.\nProof. Throughout the proof s and t will be any pair of structure maps from the set {s1 . . . sp}.\nPart a) follows from \u03b3\u03b1s = \u03b3s for all \u03b1 \u2208 R, so we can scale s such that det s = \u00b11. For every pair\n\u03b3s, \u03b3t \u2208 \u0393 we have \u03b3s \u25e6 \u03b3t = \u03b3t \u25e6 \u03b3s and \u03b32s = I, \u03b32t = I. We distinguish three different cases.\n1. \u03b3s = \u03c6s and \u03b3t = \u03c6t are automorphisms. From \u03c6\n2\ns = I we have s\n2 = \u00b1I, so s is semi-simple and\nhas eigenvalues \u00b11 or \u00b1i. In order that \u03c6s \u25e6 \u03c6t = \u03c6t \u25e6 \u03c6s we must have st = \u00b1ts. Then \u3008s, t\u3009\ngenerates a finite group. By a transformation, corresponding to averaging the inner product on V\nover this group, we obtain that s and t are orthogonal. We can do this at once for all structure\nmaps associated to automorphisms in \u3008\u03b31, . . . , \u03b3p\u3009.\n2. \u03b3s = \u03c6s is an automorphism and \u03b3t = \u03c8t is an anti-automorphism. Because of 1) we assume that s\nhas properties a), b) and c). Now \u03c82t = I implies t\n\u2217 = \u00b1t and so t is semi-simple, moreover t has\neither real or purely imaginary eigenvalues. Then it follows from \u03c6s \u25e6 \u03c8t = \u03c8t \u25e6 \u03c6s that st = \u00b1ts.\nThe latter implies that there exist indecomposable s, t-invariant subspaces on which t has either real\neigenvalues in configurations \u03b1, \u03b1\u03b1 or \u00b1\u03b1, or purely imaginary eigenvalues in configurations \u00b1i\u03b2\nor (\u00b1i\u03b2)(\u00b1i\u03b2). A scaling transformation acts on this subspace as g = \u03c1I, taking the eigenvalues\nof t to \u00b11 or \u00b1i. Since s transforms as s 7\u2192 sg\u22121 it is invariant under the scaling g. Thus t has\nproperties a), b), c) and d).\n3. \u03b3s = \u03c8s and \u03b3t = \u03c8t are anti-automorphisms. Because of 2) we assume that s has properties a),\nb) and c). Again \u03c82t = I implies t\n\u2217 = \u00b1t and so t is semi-simple, moreover t has either real or\npurely imaginary eigenvalues. From \u03c8s \u25e6 \u03c8t = \u03c8t \u25e6 \u03c8s we infer that ts = \u00b1st\u22121. Again we look\nfor a transformation that takes eigenvalues of t to \u00b11 or \u00b1i but leaves s invariant. Summarising\nwe have eight different cases s2 = \u03b51I, s\n\u2217 = \u03b51s, t\n\u2217 = \u03b52s, ts = \u03b53st\n\u22121, where \u03b5i = \u00b11. Let us\nlook at \u03b51 = \u03b52 = \u22121 and \u03b53 = \u03b5 = \u00b11, the other cases being very similar. On any indecomposable\ns, t-invariant subspace t has eigenvalues \u00b1i\u03b2 and \u00b1 i\n\u03b2\n, \u03b2 > 0. Suppose e is a vector such that\nt2e = \u2212\u03b22e. Let f be defined as f := 1\n\u03b2\nte. Then tse = \u03b5st\u22121e = \u2212\u03b5 1\n\u03b2\nsf and tsf = \u03b5st\u22121f = \u03b5 1\n\u03b2\nse.\nSince s2 = \u2212I, s2v = \u2212v for each vector v. Thus on the basis \u3008e, f, se, sf\u3009, t and s have the\nfollowing matrices\nt =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n0 \u2212\u03b2\n\u03b2 0\n0 \u03b5\u03b2\u22121\n\u2212\u03b5\u03b2\u22121 0\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , s =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u22121 0\n0 \u22121\n1 0\n0 1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 .\nNow let g be a transformation with blockdiagonal matrix diag(a\u22121I2, aI2) with a =\n\u221a\n\u03b2. Then t\nand s transform as\ngtg\u2217 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n0 \u22121\n1 0\n0 \u03b5\n\u2212\u03b5 0\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , gsg\u2217 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u22121 0\n0 \u22121\n1 0\n0 1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 = s.\nSo we see that t has the properties listed in the lemma. 2\n20\nReferences\n[1] V.I.

The notation is similar to Tables 2 and 3. Again\nthe type refers to the types in Table 1. Here X\u03bb is the (L, s)-invariant space on which L has eigenvalue\n\u03bb in the sense of Theorem 2.3 and Lemma 2.4. Eigenvalues are denoted \u03bbn when their multiplicity is\nn. We use brackets when signs are present. For example (0+)2(0\u2212) in type 2f means three eigenvalues\nzero, one with muliplicity 2 and sign +1 and one with multiplicity 1 and sign \u22121.
