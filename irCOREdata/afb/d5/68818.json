Using ethnographic data collected through interviews and observations with parents and staff from three rural primary schools in England, the research utilises Bourdieu\u2019s concepts of capital, habitus and field to show how the resources and values the parents held affected the school choices they made.

Introduction  \nLike all English schools since the 1988 Education Reform Act (ERA), rural primary \nschools have been subject to government policies aimed at raising education standards \nthrough the marketisation of education and the institution of parental choice \nmechanisms (DfE, 1992).  However, the effect the market is having on rural primary \nschools and their parent consumers is under-researched.  The parental choice literature \nhas focused predominantly on choice in urban areas (Goldring and Hausmann, 1999) \nand, with the exception of Vincent et al.\u201fs (2004) research within the pre-school \nsector, the focus has been on choice within the secondary sector (Crozier et al., 2008; \nLe Grand, 1991a; Reay, 1996; Reay and Lucey, 2000; Taylor, 2001a; 2001b; 2002; \nWillms and Echols, 1992).  This paper begins to address the gap in the literature by \ndemonstrating the complexities of primary-school choice for parents living in a rural \ncounty in England.  \n \nTraditionally English primary schools have acted as \u201efeeder\u201f schools to secondary \nschools and, for some parents, choice in the primary sector is the first step towards \nsecuring a place at their preferred secondary school.  Moreover, these are the middle-\nclass \u201eskilled\u201f parent choosers, Gewirtz et al. (1995) suggest, who think in the long-\nterm so that \u201echoice of primary school is often the first of several strategic decisions \ninvolved in the careful construction of their children\u201fs school career\u201f (Gewirtz et al., \n1995, p.26).  Extending this work, more recent studies by educational sociologists \n(Ball et al., 2004; Ball and Vincent, 2005; Vincent et al., 2004) have gone on to show \nthe ways in which \u201emiddle-class educational strategies are constructed from a very \nearly age\u201f (Ball et al., 2004, p. 478).  Parental choice within the pre-school sector \nsocially positions children thus affecting their long-term educational careers (Vincent \net al., 2004).  Working from the premise that \u201edistinctive areas\u2026 reflect the \u201elifestyle\u201f \ndifferences within the middle-class\u201f (Butler and Robson, 2003, cited in Vincent et al., \n2004, p.233) Vincent et al. argue for a \u201emore flexible approach\u201f to the process of \nparental choice by considering the link between social class, lifestyle and locality.  In \ncontrast, McDowell et al.\u201fs (2006) research into the choices that urban middle-class \nhouseholds make about childcare shows that \u201eplace is not a static, bounded container \nfor social relations but is instead the coincidence of a range of interconnected social \nprocesses operating at different scales over different time-periods\u201f (McDowell et al., \n2006, p.2163).  McDowell et al. (2006, p.2179) go on to suggest that \u201ethe significance \nof place for the middle class may be in decline\u201f.  In this paper we consider the \nsignificance of place for the parents negotiating primary school choice in a rural \nlocale.   \n \nBy drawing on the parental choice literature from educational sociology and from the \nemerging geographies of education literature (Butler and Hamnett, 2007; Butler and \nRobson, 2003; Gulson and Symes, 2007; Warrington, 2005), this paper offers an \ninsight into how \u201ethinking through education\u201f (Hanson Thiem, 2008, p.1) can inform \ncritical geographic thought by illuminating the dynamics of spatial power and cultural \ncapital through the process of parental choice.  The paper considers the choice process \nfor the parents at three rural primary schools that are in close geographic proximity; \neach school is approximately three miles away from the other two schools.  The \nparents include those who are long-term rural residents, and for the purposes of this \npaper we refer to them as the \u201elocals\u201f, whereas the parents who have moved into the \narea more recently we refer to as the \u201enewcomers\u201f.  The schools are situated in an \naffluent area and locally have good reputations.  The study sets out to uncover why \nparents see one primary school as \u201esuperior\u201f to another, and why some parents would \nchoose to send their child to a school other than their nearest when doing so incurs \nextra time and travel costs.  The paper argues that the newcomer parents have less \nallegiance to place and hence to the symbolic position that the school holds within the \nrural community.  As a consequence the newcomers are more likely to shop around \nthan the locals to find what they believe to be the \u201eright\u201f school.  Sometimes this will \nbe the same school as the locals chose (but chosen for different reasons) and \nsometimes it will be a different school.  \n \n2. Social class, resources and lifestyle \nExisting empirical research shows that finding the \u201eright\u201f school is a complex process \ndictated by family and structural limitations (Ball, 1993; 2003; Reay, 1996; Reay and \nLucey, 2000).  Choice is affected, on the one hand, by the range and number of \nresources parents have at their disposal (Vincent, 2001), and on the other, by the \nvalues they uphold (Francis and Archer, 2005; Vincent, 2001).  The education \nliterature shows that in the secondary sector parents (and pupils) are influenced by \nacademic success (Bradley et al., 2000; 2001), evidenced by league tables and Office \nfor Standards in Education (Ofsted) reports, by local rumour and reputation (Ball and \nVincent, 1998), travel distance to school and ties with the locale (Crozier et al., 2008; \nGewirtz et al., 1995; Reay and Lucey, 2000).  Although, the discourse of choice \nsuggests that equal opportunities are open to all (Le Grand, 1991b), research shows \nthat parental choice is governed by a number of structural, social and economic \nconstraints and that the process is linked to social class positioning, resources and \nlifestyle.  The neo-liberal concept of choice (DfE, 1992) is presented to parents as a \n\u201egood thing\u201f but as Ball points out (1993, p.9) \u201eparents can express a choice\u201f but it \ndoes not necessarily mean they will get that choice. \n \nMore choice is available to those with the skills and the resources to work the system \nto best advantage but the early literature polarised the process of parental choice \nbetween inertia and pro-activity referring to the parents as \u201ealert\u201f and \u201einactive\u201f \n(Willms and Echols, 1992) or \u201edisconnected\u201f working-class choosers and semi-skilled \nand skilled\u201f middle-class choosers (Gewirtz et al., 1995).  In broad terms the school \nchoice process is very different for middle-class and working-class parents but both \nVincent\u201fs (2001) and Warrington\u201fs (2005) research show that it is important to take a \nmore nuanced approach to parental choice to take account of the fractions within \nclasses.  Vincent (2001) makes a distinction between the middle-class parents who \nwork in the public sector (in education or other \u201ecaring\u201f professions) and the middle-\nclass parents who have worked their way up to supervisory and managerial posts in \nthe private sector.  She notes that the \u201eeducation-insider\u201f professional parents are the \nones who rely upon \u201etheir cultural capital as a key asset [in] helping them to identify \nand manage their children\u201fs chances of reproduction within the middle-classes\u201f (2001, \np.356).  In stark contrast to this, Warrington (2005) shows that, in spite of the \neducational aspirations working-class parents may have for their children, for parents \nwho live in areas of social deprivation the social and spatial inequalities they \nexperience negates their cultural capital.  \n \nIndeed, as Massey (1995) points out, the middle-classes are more spatially mobile \nthan the working-classes and therefore have more spatial power.  Although the \ntheorisation of rural gentrification is under researched (Smith and Higley, 2008) \nButler (1997) shows, through his research on urban gentrification, how school choice \nis one way in which the middle classes can utilise their power, using solutions such as \nmoving house or long-distance commuting \u201eto ensure that their children get the best of \nwhat is available\u201f (Butler, 1997, p.164).  Nevertheless, contemporary social-class \nanalysis shows that the rigid class divisions of working and middle-class are no longer \nflexible enough to cope with the complexity and diversity of rural family life (Cloke \nand Thrift, 1990; Urry, 1995; Savage, 2000). \n \n2.1 Choice and the market: working with Bourdieu  \nThe qualitative research has therefore focussed on the types of resources parents have, \nsuch as the time and economic cost involved in choosing a school other than a local \none or the ways in which some parents prioritise criteria such as school ethos above \nacademic reputation (Reay et al., 2007).  In explaining this situation many authors \nhave found Bourdieu\u201fs relational concepts of capital, habitus and field useful and we \nnow go on to explain why these concepts are central to the framework for this study.  \n \nOur research raises issues about the structures at play and the degree of power parents \nhave to operationalise the mechanism of school choice to best advantage.  In order, \ntherefore, to link the structure with the people we adopt a structure-agency framework \nderived from Bourdieu and suggest that this approach enables \u201ea stratified view of the \n\u201csubject\u201d whose different properties and powers emerge at each level\u201f (Archer, 2000, \np.254).  Essentially the concepts of capital, habitus and field were designed for use as \nempirical flexible tools, and as Maher (1990, p.21) points out, they offer \u201ea method, \ndirected towards the analysis of social and economic practice, firmly anchored in \nethnographic research\u201f.  Within education, researchers continue to draw upon \nBourdieu\u201fs work because of its theoretical relevance to education linked especially to \npupil achievement levels and differing parental aspirations (Gewirtz et al., 1995; \nReay, 1995a; 1995b; 1996; 2004; Francis and Archer, 2005; Archer and Francis, \n2006).  Capital enables people to take up a position, which then interacts with their \nhabitus within the field of social practice; so that for example in the field of education, \nparents possess various forms of capital, and this interacts with their habitus (or \ndisposition) resulting in school preference for a school with particular characteristics \nranging from faith-based, to size, ethos or academic status.  Within his book \nDistinction, Bourdieu (1984, p.1) suggests that cultural practices and tastes, which \ninclude level of education can be used as markers of social class so that connections \ncan be made between class advantage and educational knowledge through the concept \nof cultural capital.   \n \nIt is important, however, to note that the three conceptual tools are in fact relational \n([(habitus) (capital)] + field = practice (Bourdieu, 1984, p.101) and were not \nintended to be used in isolation.  Understandings of choice must therefore be \nconsidered not only in relation to access to capital but also to the embodied and \ninternalised concept of habitus (Bourdieu, 1977).  Habitus, Dovey (2005, p.284) \nexplains, \u201eis a way of knowing the world\u201f and as Reay (1996, p.581) points out, \nhabitus affects the connections parents make with \u201elocalised issues of history and \ngeography\u201f thus providing the context for the individual choice-making process.  \nEconomic and cultural capitals interact with personal habitus to shape the spatial \nframework within which parents operate (Reay, 1996).   \n \nIn this paper we draw on the concepts to illustrate the ways in which capital and \nhabitus affect parents making school choices in a rural context.  Bourdieu\u201fs work \noften focuses on conflict and in this paper we studied particularly the conflicts parents \nhave from various pressures on them when choosing a school.  The ideal school - \nnearest and in all respects best - may not exist; we study how parents resolve these \nconflicts.  The pervasive surplus of rural primary school places in our county means \nthat conflict among parents for scarce places at over-subscribed schools does not \noccur.  With this in mind we now turn to the relevance of this discussion with respect \nto parental choice in a rural county in northern England.  \n \n3. Methodology \nThis study considered the complex interactions between three schools and their parent \nconsumers within the context of the rural educational market place and therefore \nrequired a methodology that allowed us to \u201eengage with\u201f rather than \u201eignore\u201f those \ncomplexities (Limb and Dwyer, 2001, p.2).  In order to study real people in real \nsituations we therefore chose a mixed-method qualitative approach to include in-depth \ninterviews, non-participant observations and analysis of secondary data.   \n \nThe research draws on data collected at three rural primary schools during the summer \nand autumn school terms of 2004; analysis of the county and school Ofsted reports \nand school prospectuses; a week of observations in each school collecting detailed \nfield notes; and 34 semi-structured interviews with county council employees, staff, \ngovernors and parents.  The interviews lasted between one and one and a half hours, \nall were transcribed and analysed, and a sub-set is displayed here as quotations.  The \nnames of the schools, participants and all the places discussed in this paper are \npseudonyms.  \n \n \nInsert Table 1 here:  Parent Participants \n \n \nInsert Table 2 here: Teacher and County Council Participants  \n \nThe county has a low-density population and a high proportion of primary schools \nwith a hundred or fewer pupils (Ofsted, 2001a).  Given that the three schools are \nperilously close to or under the 50-pupil threshold that the county uses to classify \nschools as \u201every small\u201f all three schools are vulnerable to closure in a county that has \nsurplus primary school places (Defra, 2004).  The schools work in a cluster with three \nothers, sharing facilities and resources and they apply for funding specifically targeted \ntowards small schools that are prepared to work in collaboration with similarly sized \nschools (Ribchester and Edwards, 1999; Williams, 2008).  Yet the reality is that the \nschools are operating in what Taylor (2002, p.199) refers to as \u201ea local competitive \narena\u201f.  The three schools have surplus places and need to compete with their \nneighbours for pupils so that school choice in this context is real for parents.  This is \nnot a situation where there are more pupils than there are school places.  The Local \nAuthority uses the system of catchment and out-of-catchment, and because of this we \nrefer to this categorisation to differentiate between those pupils who attend their \nnearest (catchment) school and those who do not.  However, the system (used in other \ncounties) of a geographical boundary i.e. a catchment area, to ensure that pupils are \ndistributed between schools, does not come into play in this county where surplus \nplaces are endemic.   \n \nThe county is characterised by pockets of affluence and deprivation (Ofsted, 2001a) \nand the three schools in our study are situated in relatively affluent villages.  \nHowever, approximately 3 miles from Greenthwaite is the village of Lowdale; an \nindustrial village with a highly transient population and a large Local Authority \nhousing estate.  At the time of data collection Lowdale Community School, had a \npupil roll of 80 and was designated as a Sure Start school providing extra resources to \nlocal families and pupils.  None of the pupils in our three schools travelled from \nLowdale village, and no one from our study area was known to send their child to \nLowdale School.  Fieldsend headteacher Alison believed that the working-class \nparents in Lowdale did not have realisable school choice and she said, \u201eone or two \nparents in Lowdale wanted to send their children here but even if they have a car well, \nthey don\u201ft always have the money for petrol\u201f.  The contrast between Lowdale and the \nother three schools highlights the connection for parents between class, resources and \nchoice.    \n    \nInsert Table 3 here: The Schools  \n \n \n \n \n3.1 Fieldsend Church of England Voluntary Controlled\n1\n School \nFieldsend School is an infant and junior school catering for 4-11 year olds.  The \nchildren are divided into three classes.  Pupil attainment on entry is \u201earound the \nnational average\u201f (Ofsted, 2000a).  The school has three classrooms, a hall, staff \nroom\/library, office, playground, playing fields and a garden.  The school is close to \nthe village green with its cluster of cottages, converted barns and parish church.  The \nvillage has some new houses including some \u201eaffordable homes\u201f and a range of \nservices including a pub, hotel, garage, hall, children\u201fs play area, nursery and medical \ncentre.  The school building dates back to the late nineteenth century and has \nundergone various extensions to provide more facilities but has kept a number of \noriginal features that maintain its historical identity.  \n \nFieldsend School was named nationally as a \u201eSuccessful School\u201f and hence has a local \nreputation for being a \u201egood\u201f school.  Alison, the headteacher, says this resulted in the \nschool being sought after by parents of children who would not be eligible for a \nStatement of Special Needs, \u201echildren who really don\u201ft get any funding but are \nstruggling\u201f.  The school is now known locally for its positive approach and caring \nethos and many interviewees backed this up reflecting the power of \u201ehot knowledge\u201f \n(Ball and Vincent 1998) and gossip in rural communities (Parr et al., 2004).  \n                                                 \n1\nChurch of England schools are divided into two categories: voluntary controlled and voluntary aided.  \nThe Local Authority maintains and is the school\u201fs admissions authority for voluntary controlled \nschools, such as Fieldsend.  The Church has less influence over voluntarily-controlled schools than \nvoluntarily-aided schools, with regard to school ethos and admissions.  The surplus of primary-school \nplaces means that here, unlike in other counties, faith is not currently used as a criterion for school \nadmissions.    \n \n 3.2 Greenthwaite Community School \nGreenthwaite School is an infant and junior school for 4-11 year olds. The children \nare divided into two classes.  Pupil attainment on entry is at the \u201eexpected level\u201f \n(Ofsted, 2001b).  The school has two classrooms, an office for the headteacher and a \nsmall office\/kitchen for the secretary.  There are very few services within the village, \nother than the school, village hall and church, and since the Victorian school building \nis located on the village green the school appears visually to be \u201eat the heart of the \ncommunity\u201f.  \n \nThe school is renowned locally for its high academic standards and the excellent art, \ndrama and music teaching the school provides.  It received national media attention \nfor winning a prestigious national art competition which provided wide exposure to \npotential consumers.  Headteacher Bill believes that the school\u201fs \u201eoutstanding\u201f \nreputation is crucial to its survival: \u201eif I relied on the children from Greenthwaite there \nwould be seven children in school\u201f.  Bill is aware that, by specifically targeting \nparents from out-of-catchment, he is attracting parents who consider Greenthwaite to \nbe \u201esuperior\u201f [Bill\u201fs judgement] to their local school and recognises that this choice \ncosts the parents \u201etime, transport and commitment\u201f.   \n \n3.3 Marshland Community School \nMarshland School is an infant and junior school for 4-11 year olds.  The school has \ntwo classrooms, a classroom\/library, a hall, an office, a staff-room, a kitchen (school \nmeals are cooked on the premises), a playground and playing fields.  The children are \ndivided into three classes.  Pupil attainment on entry is \u201eslightly below the expected \nlevel\u201f (Ofsted, 2000b).  The school was built in the 1960s on the edge of the village \nnext to what was originally a small council-housing estate.  The village contains a mix \nof houses including barn conversions, modern detached houses, small terraced \ncottages and housing-association homes.  Village services include a pub, a church, a \nchapel and a baker\u201fs shop.  \n \nThe school has a reputation for working closely with the local community and was the \nfirst within the area to offer extended childcare with a breakfast club and an after-\nschool club and an on-site nursery.  Headteacher Rebecca recognises that this gave the \nschool a marketing advantage because, \u201ethere are certainly some parents who have \ndeliberately chosen the school because of the care that we provide\u201f.  \n \nIn the following section through the themes of lifestyle and loyalty we explore the \ncomplexity of parents\u201f choice-making with reference to their capital and their habitus \nin order to understand how resources and values informed the choice-making process \nfor this set of parents. \n \n4. Parents making choices: the familiar and the unknown \nFor some parents school choice is not a complicated process, being governed by \nfamilial ties to their local catchment school.  Local parent Jenny works part-time as a \nclerk cashier in the family business and is a parent helper at Greenthwaite School; her \nhusband is a company director and also a parent governor at the school. Their two \nchildren both attended their nearest school, Greenthwaite, and here Jenny explains \nhow family habitus affected her choice decision: \u201eThere isn\u201ft another school in the \narea I would have chosen; I have family in the village and both my nieces have been \neducated here\u201f.  For some parents the attractiveness of the village school is linked to \nthe myth of the \u201erural idyll\u201f (Valentine, 1997) and, as Woods (2005, p.13) points out, \nthe myth has been responsible for encouraging in-migrants to move to the \ncountryside.  Several newcomer parents (who eventually chose out-of-catchment) \nexpressed difficulties in actually finding out about the schools, describing the process \nas long and convoluted.  Paula remembered that she was given information about only \nthe catchment school: \u201eWe weren\u201ft told about another school\u201f and Samantha said, \u201eI \ndidn\u201ft even know there was a school here; I was so new to the area\u201f.  The newly \narrived migrants lacked local knowledge about the surrounding schools and therefore \nneeded to make an effort in order to make their choices.  \n \n4.1 Lifestyle and school choice \nFor several newcomer parents school choice was linked to lifestyle and the decision to \nmigrate to the countryside.  Karl, a former teacher and newcomer from Germany, \nsaid: \u201eMy wife and I needed a property with some land for horses\u2026then we found \nGreenthwaite\u2026without the school we would not in fact have moved here\u201f. Karl was \nkeen that his children should attend their nearest school because it was what he had \ndone when he was a child, \u201ewe walked to school\u2026my parents never ever would take \nus in the car to school\u201f.  Fortunately, Karl and his wife had the economic capital to \nbuy a house in a village, which the school secretary said \u201ewas an unusual occurrence \nfor a young family\u201f because of the high price of houses.  Nevertheless, walking to \nschool was not Karl\u201fs only priority; school size was also an issue.  Karl preferred \nsmall schools because his experience as a teacher was that, \u201ethe smaller the classes, \nthe easier problems can be sorted out\u201f.  What Karl specifically liked about \nGreenthwaite was, \u201ethe care they get here, the personal attention\u201f.  Karl is like the \nstereotypical, high-wealth urban parent who buys into the catchment of the \u201eright\u201f \nschool and \u201eright\u201f for Karl, an education-insider, is influenced by his habitus such that \nhe preferred to send his children to a very small local school. \n \nRural primary schools are often perceived to be distinctive and better because of their \nsmall size and caring family ethos (Local Government Association, 2000).  Indeed the \nwider research project on which this paper draws showed that the three factors - small \nschool size, caring school ethos and one-to-one attention - were frequently mentioned \nby the newcomer parents as the variables that attracted them to choose a rural school, \nallowing the parents to take into account particular characteristics of their children \nand to match them to the schools (Moser, 2006).  Colin and his wife (who is a general \npractitioner) bought a four-bedroomed, detached house in Fieldsend village, which \nheadteacher Alison says, \u201eis becoming quite an elite place\u201f.  Former secondary-school \nteacher and newcomer Colin said his five-year-old son, James, had dyslexia and he \nwanted him to attend a small school so that James would have extra help from the \nstaff.  However, Colin considered Greenthwaite with its two-classes to be \u201etoo small\u201f \nand that the relatively larger six-class school at Fieldsend would be better suited for \nJames.  Colin said, \u201eI think it\u201fs good that everyone knows everyone.  All the kids \nknow the parents, the staff; it\u201fs just size and I think that\u201fs the biggest plus point of the \nschool\u201f.  School size also affected Colin\u201fs long-term thinking with regard to \nsecondary school choice; Fieldsend is in the catchment area of a small secondary \nschool in Fayretown.  Moreover, here we see how education-insider Colin was also \naffected by his own schooling: \nI was keen we would be in the Fayretown secondary school catchment area\u2026I \nwent to a fairly small secondary school and I\u201fve always felt that small schools \nhave got huge advantages.  (Colin, Fieldsend School, catchment) \n \nColin, like Karl, is buying into the catchment of his preferred school but in this case \nthe \u201eright\u201f school for Colin extends from the primary into the secondary sector.  \nHence Colin\u201fs plans for his son\u201fs schooling are typical of the middle-class, long-term \nplanning discussed by Gewirtz et al. (1995).  And similarly to Karl, choice for Colin \nis also influenced by habitus and his personal experience of attending a small school.  \n \nHowever, not all the newcomers could afford to buy into the village of the school of \ntheir choice.  Louise and her husband, who is a self-employed fine artist, migrated \nfrom the city to Fayretown, a small rural town approximately seven miles away from \nFieldsend.  Louise, like a number of parents who were interviewed, was concerned \nthat her child \u201ewould get lost at the back of a class of 30 pupils\u201f and so she chose \nFieldsend rather than one of the larger schools in Fayretown:  \n \u2026he was very shy and I just thought he might get lost at the back of a big \nclass. I could tell he was bright\u2026I just felt that in a big class if you can do the \nwork you might be left to it more, rather than being perhaps pushed a bit \nfurther.  And also I thought it would combat his shyness which I think has \nworked here because I think being in that just smaller group has helped.  \n(Louise, Fieldsend School, out-of-catchment) \n \nNevertheless, choosing the somewhat smaller village school requires a time-space \nflexibility from full-time, homemaker Louise because it involves a twice-daily, \nfourteen-mile commute which, if both of her children attend Fieldsend through to the \nend of their primary schooling, will extend over ten years.  Research by Little and \nAustin (1996) shows that mothers consider the countryside to be a safer place than the \ncity to bring up their children.  Sian also moved from the city to the countryside to \nprovide her two children with what she referred to as \u201ea rural lifestyle\u201f. Sian is a self-\nemployed business consultant with an MSc in Community Education and her husband \nis a former Steiner schoolteacher.  They were keen to find a school with small class \nsizes and so they rejected the nearest school, whose classes averaged 30 pupils, and \nopted for the \u201every small\u201f out-of-catchment Greenthwaite:  \nThe education system in Britain starts kids too young\u2026our view is that kids \nup to seven should be playing and hanging out.  When we moved here, my son \nwas rising seven and hadn\u201ft been to school so we thought there is no point in \nputting him with 30 children where he\u201fll be with age-peers but way behind in \nterms of the basic stuff, although ahead in other things\u2026So we thought we\u201fd \nlook around and we came down for a day and sat in and thought a) they are \nrobust enough to cope and b) he is not going to be so shown up because he is \ngoing to be in a class with four, five and six-year olds.  (Sian, Greenthwaite \nSchool, out-of-catchment)     \n \nHowever, the daily commute from one village to another has resulted in Sian feeling \nlike \u201ea fish out of water\u201f at the school gate.  Her ideal is that the children walk to \nschool but in order to provide them with the education of her choice she drives them \nto a school seven miles from their home.  Sian has the resources to enable her to \nexercise choice.  Firstly, the family had the economic capital to relocate from the city \nto the countryside.  Secondly, she and her husband have high levels of educational \ncapital, which gives them the confidence to choose the school they believe will best \nsuit their children.  Thirdly, since both parents are self-employed they have flexible \nworking hours giving them time to commit to the twice-daily, fourteen-mile school \nrun.  \n \nNewcomer and full-time homemaker Samantha also committed herself to a twice-\ndaily twelve-mile school run rather than opt for her local school.  Samantha\u201fs husband \nis a solicitor and they recently moved to the countryside from London.  Samantha has \nthe time to commit to the school run which sometimes extends to three round trips in \none day when she returns to school in the evening to support school events such as the \nweekly aerobics class for staff and parents.  Her experience of both the private and the \nstate sector in London has convinced her that the daily school run is \u201eworth it\u201f:  \n...moving up from having to fight for places in London you are used to having \nto drive further to get to a decent school.  It takes me twenty-five minutes to \ndrive here and twenty-five minutes to drive home. They\u201fve got more than the \nstate school in London had facility wise\u2026 I just can\u201ft fault it compared with \nwhat I\u201fve come from with private schools and paying fees and then coming \nhere; it\u201fs incredible\u2026 (Samantha, Marshland School, out-of-catchment) \n \nLike Sian who \u201elooked around\u201f before making her choice, Samantha, describing \nherself as a \u201eruthless, pushy parent\u201f, visited four schools before opting for Marshland. \nNevertheless, schools with ten or fewer pupils in Year 6 do not have their Key Stage 2 \nSATs (Standard Assessment Task) results published in the league tables to protect \nindividual pupils from identification (DfES 2004) and so Samantha turned to the \nschools\u201f Ofsted reports:  \nI was looking at their \u201eareas for improvement\u201f; I was looking for the faults \nfirst and then I read the summary.  Ofsted are always quite pleasant about the \nschools, it just depends on what adjective they use.  (Samantha, Marshland \nSchool, out-of-catchment). \n \nIn addition to her detailed examination of the reports, Samantha also used the skills \nshe learned from her own \u201edetermined\u201f mother whom she described as \u201etrawling \naround\u201f to find a school for her after she had failed the 11+.  Samantha is concerned \nwith the extrinsic value which educational qualifications bring and wants her son to \nattend the local selective grammar school.  Here she explains how her own \nexperiences together with her economic capital have affected her approach to her \nson\u201fs situation:  \nI\u201fd never seen a paper until the day of my 11+ so we weren\u201ft prepared \u2026I\u201fm \ncoaching him in the evenings and really doing my best to get him there; I \nspend a fortune on those past papers.  (Samantha, Marshland School, out-of-\ncatchment) \n \nIt is clear that the choice process Samantha engaged with took a great deal of time and \neffort, something that Sian also invested in her choice of schools.  But significantly \nthese two parents chose different schools that are only three miles apart.  Samantha \ndid not consider Greenthwaite because it was \u201etoo small\u201f whereas Sian specifically \nwanted a \u201every small school\u201f2.  Samantha consulted the Ofsted reports but Sian relied \nmore upon her educational capital and her husband\u201fs \u201einsider\u201f knowledge of the \nsystem.  Within the typology of choosers both Samantha and Sian are middle-class \n                                                 \n2\n Schools with 50 or fewer pupils are described by Ofsted as \u201every small\u201f. \nand skilled but they are operating with differing values illustrated by the different \nways they went about the choice process.  Samantha\u201fs ultimate goal is that her son \nwill pass the entrance examination to the local selective school whereas Sian\u201fs goal is \nfor her children to attend a school that pays attention to the expressive side of the \nchild \u201edespite the National Curriculum\u201f.  One of the things she likes about \nGreenthwaite is that in her opinion the pupils \u201eare not sweating away worrying about \nthe SATs too much\u201f whereas Samantha believes that it is important for her son to \nspend an extra hour each day on SATs revision in order \u201eto earn TV\u201f.  The difference \nbetween these mothers is that Samantha is a skilled \u201emanagerial\u201f middle-class chooser \n(Vincent, 2001) who places her trust in public measures of accountability such as \nOfsted reports.  In contrast, Sian relies on her own education capital and her \nhusband\u201fs \u201eeducation-insider\u201f status so that Sian is in fact a skilled \u201eprofessional\u201f \nmiddle-class chooser (Vincent, 2001).   \n \n4.2 Loyalty and school choice  \nFor the newcomer parents, who can afford to buy locally and for those parents who \nlive out-of-catchment and can afford the time and cost of the daily school run, choice \nappears to be advantageous.  However, not all of the participants agreed that parents \nshould have that choice. The general response from the local parents was that parents \nshould support their catchment school and that not to do so was divisive to the local \ncommunity and could jeopardise the survival of the school.  \n \nLocal parent Jenny saw the school offering a key service to the community, \u201eI think if \nthe village was to lose the school the village would die really because it is the hub of \nthe village\u201f.  Although Jenny understands that the school must draw out-of-catchment \npupils to maintain the pupil roll, she gets angry that the parents from out-of-catchment \ndo not make as much effort to support the school as the locals:   \nThey\u201fll do a Cheese and Wine and it\u201fs getting to the point where it\u201fs not \nsupported as well from some of the parents that live out of the area but you\u201fll \nguarantee it will be mostly village people that will support it which annoys me \ncos I think, \u201ewell, we\u201fre getting the village people coming in and it\u201fs your \nschool, isn\u201ft it?  But that\u201fs how society is going now; some people just want \ntheir children educated.  (Parent Jenny, Greenthwaite, catchment) \n \nRaymond, who owns a local farm, said that when his primary school closed, \u201eit \naffected the community\u2026 it knocks the stuffing out of a village because the school is \nthe central thing\u201f.  Raymond subsequently attended his new catchment school at \nMarshland, as have his three children.  When the school received a poor Ofsted report \nin 1997 Raymond was by this time a parent governor and determined to work towards \nimproving the school to ensure its survival.  Raymond was aware, as were many of \nthe local parents from the three schools in the cluster, that if pupil numbers fell, small \nschools were vulnerable to closure and he said this about choice:   \nIt is good, but it isn\u201ft good either cos if a school sounds as if it\u201fs in trouble, \neverybody gets on the grapevine \u201eoh don\u201ft send your kids there, they\u201fre in big \ntrouble\u201f.  It almost lets people run away. (Raymond, Marshland School, \ncatchment) \n \nRaymond felt that parents should support their local school by helping to solve the \nproblems rather than \u201ejump ship\u201f as newcomer Paula did when she moved her son \nfrom Marshland to nearby Greenthwaite following the school\u201fs \u201epoor\u201f 1997 Ofsted \nreport.  But, as a newcomer, Paula had little allegiance to the locale and she was \ndriven by her personal needs for her son and she said, \u201eI\u201fd heard that things weren\u201ft \ngoing right at Marshland\u201f and so she removed him from the school.  However, \nRaymond felt a strong loyalty to his local school, Greenthwaite, and he wanted to \npreserve it for the rural community.  In fact several participants at Marshland made \nreference to \u201ethe parent\u201f who had \u201ejumped ship\u201f and it was obvious that tensions were \nstill running high amongst the locals who were angry that management consultant \nPaula had moved her son to an out-of-catchment school. \n   \nNewcomer Samantha also experienced ill feeling because she chose out-of-catchment \nand said, \u201eIn the village I was labelled quite snobby and a lot of people didn\u201ft talk to \nme for a long time because I hadn\u201ft sent my children to the local school\u201f.  But having \ncome from London Samantha said she was \u201eused to having to fight for everything\u201f \nand her reaction to the people who opted for the nearest school was that they were \ntaking \u201ethe easy option\u201f.  Newcomer Kate believes that the local parents take \u201ethe easy \noption\u201f because of their perception of travel distance:    \nYou find in talking to the local people who\u201fve been born and bred here, that if \nyou travel ten miles out of the area they are absolutely amazed\u2026Some people \nhave not been out of the county; they\u201fve married locally, all their family is \nlocal.  I travel five hours to visit my mother but these people have got their \nparents in the village\u2026and so, yes, if they wanted to move schools, travelling \nto do so is just not considered.  It\u201fs got to be their local and that\u201fs it.  (Kate, \nMarshland School, catchment)   \nFull-time homemaker Kate has a BA (Hons) in English and Visual Arts and is married \nto an industrial manager; after several job-related house moves the family finally \nsettled in the village of Marshland.  Although Kate\u201fs daughter attends the local school \nKate has little allegiance to Marshland saying that she would \u201edo whatever it took\u201f to \nachieve her daughter\u201fs preferred choice, whether this was in- or out-of-catchment.  \nFurthermore, she had little patience with \u201emoaning\u201f parents who, she said, should \u201eget \nup and march on their feet\u201f.  Kate clearly lacks an understanding of the barriers, such \nas transport and time costs involved for some parents in realising school choice.  In \ncontrast local parent and part-time farmer Margaret was relieved when her sons \nmoved from nursery to their nearest school two miles away saying, \u201eI found it a trek \nhaving to go five and a half miles to nursery\u201f. \n \nNevertheless, not all of the local parents sent their children to the nearest school.  \nSome locals (particularly those from Fayretown) chose an out-of-catchment school \nover issues related to bullying, unhappiness or a fall in school standards.  Several \nparents described the morning school run with parents driving in and out of school \ncatchment areas.  Natalie said, \u201eI pass them every morning; I\u201fm going this way and \nthey\u201fre going that way\u201d.  Natalie is a local mother who chose out-of-catchment \nbecause at the time her local school was experiencing difficulties, \u201ethe headmaster \nwas in and out and had a nervous break-down so there was no real focus there\u201f.  \nDuring her own primary school years Natalie attended an out-of-catchment primary \nschool because her family moved house and rather than change schools Natalie \ncommuted each day.  Choosing a school other than her local one therefore did not \nseem such an unusual decision to make for her children.  Like the newcomer parents \ndescribed earlier who chose out-of-catchment, Natalie was a full-time homemaker \nwith her own car and she had the transport and the time to make a choice for her \ndaughters.  If her youngest child remains at Fieldsend School until the move to the \nsecondary sector then Natalie will have driven from her local community to the school \ncommunity for fourteen years.   \n \nAlthough some local parents thought that choice was divisive, choice for parents like \nNatalie had its advantages.  However, for local parents like Jenny and Raymond, the \nschool not only offers a vital service to the community it also represents a symbol of \ntheir community identity (Forsythe, 1984) and both parents were loyal and keen to \nwork to support their local school.  Nevertheless, as we see with newcomer parents \nlike Paula, Samantha and Kate, the market-driven education system encourages parent \nconsumers to be motivated by self-interest (Gewirtz et al., 1993).  Duty to one\u201fs child \nand loyalty to the local school (as a symbol of the wider community) are one and the \nsame for some parents.  For others, the individual and the collective are in opposition, \nwith family interests outweighing community interests. \n \n5. Conclusion \nThis paper demonstrates some of the complexities of the school choice process and \nshows how choice is valued differently by different parents living in rural areas.    \nSchool choice for some parents was based on one dominant factor; for others it was a \ncombination of factors.  For example, some parents chose the local, catchment school \nbecause they wanted their children to walk to school; some chose it because of their \nfamily ties with the school and others out of a sense of duty to support the local \ncommunity.  However, for those parents who did not feel that their nearest school was \nthe \u201eright\u201f school, choice involved daily commuting to a more distant school, \nincurring costs that required a gendered time-space flexibility, since it was mostly the \nmothers who were involved in the school run.  Nevertheless, constraints of time and \nmoney meant that it was a choice available to some parents more than others.  \n \nThe urban, parental-choice literature suggests that it is the dominant middle-class \nparents who have the most spatial power to operationalise the mechanism of parental \nchoice. This paper shows that this is played out in the rural, primary-school market \nplace by those who can afford the cost and the time of the daily commute or by the \nparents who can afford to move house so that the \u201eright\u201f school became their local \nschool.  Nevertheless, as we have shown in this paper, social class status has some \npredictive power within the school choice process (particularly when Lowdale School \nis compared with the other three studied here) but there are other factors that also \ncome into play; choice is in fact multi-dimensional.  For this reason we utilised \nBourdieu\u201fs relational concepts of capital and habitus to help us capture the \ncomplexities involved in the choice-making process for parents.  Parents not only \nbrought their economic capital into the process but also their cultural capital which \nincludes their educational qualifications and most importantly for some, their \u201einsider\u201f \nknowledge of the education system.  The parents with the most choice were the \nparents with the most amounts of economic and cultural capital. \n \nHowever, choice for the majority of the parents in this study was also tempered by \ntheir childhood experiences.  Some parents like Karl wanted to reproduce their \nschooling, involving criteria such as small and local, whereas some parents, like \nSamantha, wanted their children to have a better education than they had experienced.  \nThere were also parents who thought in the short-term so that choice of primary \nschool was an end in itself and then there were the long-term strategists such as Colin, \nwho thought beyond the primary and on to the secondary sector.   There were many \nways in which a school could be the \u201eright\u201f one with parents such as Sian and \nMargaret, choosing the same school for different reasons.  Sian chose Greenthwaite \nbecause of its small size and school ethos whereas Margaret chose it because it was \nher nearest school.  Indeed the process was one of equifinality in which the same \noutcome was reached by parents for different reasons.  In order therefore to highlight \nthe various processes rather than the outcomes we studied the parents\u201f personal \nchildhood and work experiences through the embodied concept of habitus and \nconsidered how habitus affected the choice process.   \n \nFor some local parents, like Natalie, her own childhood experience of attending an \nout-of-catchment school spurred her on to look for an alternative school when her \nlocal school was experiencing difficulties.  Nevertheless, for the majority of local \nparents like Raymond, school choice included an emotional commitment to the rural \ncommunity which involved supporting the local school.  However, the study shows \nthat not all of the participants believed that choice was necessarily good; some saw it \nas in fact divisive to the community.  The newcomer parents had less commitment to \nplace and therefore were more likely to shop around than the local parents who had a \nstronger allegiance to support their local school.  In an urban environment it is \nperhaps less obvious when parents do not support their local school.  However, in a \nrural location, where there are fewer schools and the boundaries surrounding rural \ncommunities are more visible (Cohen, 1982), it is more obvious when parents do not \nchoose the local village school.  This leaves those \u201eexercising their right to choose\u201f or \n\u201edefecting\u201f open to criticism, particularly from the local parents.  \n \nThe more recent approach to parental choice connecting social class fractions, \nlifestyle and locality (Vincent, 2001; Vincent et al., 2004; Ball and Vincent, 2005) \nsuggests that for families with school-age children lifestyle choice includes school \nchoice and that this is connected to locality.  However, the research in this paper \nshows that this is too simple; rural lifestyle for the newcomer parents is not enough \nand not place specific.  It has to be the \u201eright\u201f rural school.  Certainly current rural \nmigration literature suggests that people who opt for a rural lifestyle also wish to join \nthe rural community (Cloke et al., 1995), which one would presume includes \nsupporting the local school, but as McDowell (2006) has also shown, with the urban \nmiddle-classes, lifestyle is not necessarily place specific.  Some of the newcomer \nparents and some of the local parents within this study engaged in a daily migration \nfrom one rural community to another in order to provide their children with their \npreferred school choice suggesting that educational style and reproducing social \nadvantage were more important to these parents than community loyalty.   \n \nNevertheless, the newcomer parents more often had less allegiance to place than \nlonger-term residents, and hence to the symbolic position that the school holds within \nthe rural community where they lived.  Allegiance to place has become less important \nin school choices amongst newcomers as a result of the marketisation of education.  \nAllegiance to place is less enforced by rigid catchment area policies and now has to be \nwon by schools from those parents who have the economic and cultural capital to \nexercise real choice.  The reality is that the three schools in this study are working \nwithin a local arena where there is an increasing trend of falling pupil numbers within \nthe county.  So every pupil attracted from out-of-catchment to another rural primary \nschool moves the catchment school closer to the size threshold for closure.  The \npolicy of school choice encourages parents with resources to drive their children from \none village to the next in their quest to find the \u201eright\u201f school. However, as our study \nshows, it is more difficult for parents to fully engage with their chosen rural school \nwhen the school is not their nearest.  Moreover, driving out-of-catchment increases \n\u201eschool-run miles\u201f when we are being asked to reduce our carbon footprint (DfT, \n2004) and when children are being encouraged to walk and cycle to school for health \nreasons (NICE, 2009).  Future research might examine changes in parents\u201f choices as \ntravel costs increase and the achievements and reputations of individual schools wax \nand wane.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nOur thanks go to the staff, pupils, parents and volunteers at the three schools for \nagreeing to take part in the research.
