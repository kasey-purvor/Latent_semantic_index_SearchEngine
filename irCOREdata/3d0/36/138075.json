In the present context, it includes \nthe manpower and services of Nigerian origin, which contribute to the national economy [1]. It \nis the integrated contributions to any of the myriad of activities, operations or inputs in the \nCONG extraction-process which are made by Nigerian personnel, local contractors, wholly-\nowned Nigerian companies or by Nigerian registered companies in which Nigerians effectively \nown a majority of the equity [2]. \n \nIndigenous Contractor or Company \n \nThis is one that (i) is registered in Nigeria with a 60 to 100% Nigerian shareholding, (ii) \npossesses appropriate expertise, and financial viability, and (iii) has proved to be a contributor \nto the economic growth in its area of operation [1]. However, some, perversely but \nunderstandably due to frustration, define local contractors as the \u2018reverse of the foreign multi-\nnationals like Shell, Chevron, Mobil, Addax Petroleum, Conoco Energy and so forth\u2019 [3].  \nUnlike multi-national corporations, local contractors unfortunately at present possess a low \nequity-base, often being owner managed, and are incapable of meeting the titanic financial \ncommitments involved in CONG explorations and production. \n \nAfrica: its problems, causes and opportunities \nThis is the only content in which the prevalence of poverty (arising predominantly from \ncorruption and bad government) is increasing and life expectancy falling. In Africa, at least \n30,000 children die each day, mostly from (i) preventable diseases or (ii) a lack of food and \nportable water. Another ~7000 perish from Aids daily. The prevalence of ill health (e.g. those \nsuffering from tuberculosis, malaria or HIV\/Aids) leads to depleting capability of undertaking \nwork and eventually death. In some African countries, the average life-expectancy is as low as \n33 years. Thus, it is understandable that many African desperately wish for high-quality \nprevention and treatment health services as well as better living standards. These will ensue \nwith moves to smaller families, environmentally sustainable activities and greater respect for \nhuman rights. The extremes of droughts and flood, leading to crises are prevalent. Plagues of \nlocusts, which devour crops on a large scale, have become a major scourge partly because the \ninternational programme of extermination is no longer fully implemented. \n \nAnnual global trade with Africa has fallen by approximately two-thirds since AD 1980. Sub-\nSaharan Africa\u2019s share of global commerce declined from 6% to 4% during the period AD1984 \n\u2013 AD2004. \n \nCorruption, nepotism, autocratism, bad governance, brutality and systematic mismanagement \nare some of the root causes of many of the continents problems. Zimbabwe at the moment \nprovides a depressing illustration of how a brutal and perfidious regime can destroy the \ncountry\u2019s natural economic advantage and condemn the majority of its population to repression \nand poverty. The continent would benefit immensely if each country became a multi-political \nparty, meritocratic democracy with a highly accountable government. \n \n3 \nHaving increased \u2018local content\u2019 in each multi-national high tech industry will raise the mean \nstandard-of \u2013living of the continents population. Building Action for Africa (BAA), a new \nworking and pressure group formed by multi-national organisations it is hoped will facilitate \nthis by promoting good business practices and boost brand Africa. However the destiny of \nAfrica is ultimately in African hands! \n \nVast foreign aid has been injected into Africa for the last 20 years; unfortunately it has tended \nto breed a dependence culture. While financial aid and debt relief are desirable starting points, \nthey will not by themselves lead to full, long-term, ethically-sustainable developments: \nappropriate education, transparent governance and effective risk-management are also needed. \n \nNigeria\u2019s Challenge \n \nSome of the predicaments of Africa in general, as mentioned in the previous section, also apply \nin Nigeria. The majority of Nigerians are wretchedly poor as a result of past years of misrule \nand ethnic conflicts. Corruption has swallowed much of the oil wealth in Nigeria for the last 30 \nyears. However, many Nigerian villagers realise that their country, the worlds seventh largest \nexporter of oil, is very wealthy, yet they have to live on less than 60 pence per day. Thus \nforeign aid should be channelled to where it is most needed, i.e. to the poor Nigerian with the \naim of creating wealth for them.  \n \nTo achieve sustainability, it is usually better to be given a fishing rod rather than a fish. Trade \nis preferable to financial assistance. However when poverty stricken far less is wasted! Hence \nin Nigeria, basic skills are prevalent, i.e. it is the norm for clapped-out cars to be kept running. \nSo the foundations for a thrifty society exist.  \n \nIndustry in Nigeria produces or incurs many problems. Three examples will be mentioned. \nCONG and the petrochemical industries have desecrated several areas and so destroyed the \nlivelihoods of local farmers due to the resulting soil and water pollution. This has been \nresented. On the other hand, the SPDC uncovered 16 cases of bribery amongst their Nigerian \nemployees in AD2004 (i.e. up from 8 in AD 2003) and cancelled 64 local contracts in Nigeria \nin AD 2004 (again up from 49 in AD 2003). The manufacture of fake pharmaceuticals is a \nbooming business in Nigeria: these fail to cure anyone and result in patients passing on their \ninfections or even dying. These challenges must be faced. \n \nTo develop greater trust in Nigerian entrepreneurs, by foreign organisations, there should be a \nlegally-binding guarantee that those bidding for any contract should have available, within one \nmonth of the contract being awarded, all the necessary equipment and indigenous expertise \nnecessary for the satisfactory completion of the contract. When highly-specialised equipment \nor appropriately qualified personnel needed to undertake delicate tasks have, subsequent to the \ncontract being awarded, to be hired from abroad, extremely expensive delays, of even a day, \nsometimes have ensued in completing the contract. This is why the CONG industry in Nigeria \nin Nigeria is reluctant to depend upon Nigerian entrepreneurs for complex contracts. This \nmajor problem has to be overcome if indigenous labour and locally-manufactured artefacts are \nto play a more significant role: often western-educated Nigerians are preferred for employment \nby ex-pat companies rather than locally-trained ones because they are more likely to \nacknowledge the existence of these problems. \n \n4 \nThe Nigerian government should foster (by the provision of more appropriate vocational-\neducation establishments) small indigenous businesses and tax incentives for setting up high-\ntech industries alongside appropriate university departments. Entrepreneurship will then \nflourish; a more buoyant market-economy develops so leading to wealth creation and reducing \nthe prevalence of poverty. Education results in greater (i) stability in society (ii) equality of \nopportunity and (iii) respect for civil liberties. Having a strong manufacturing and industrial \nsector is an important means of overcoming poverty. For this to flourish, Nigeria needs \ndependable electricity and pure water supplies. The government also needs to offer generous \nfinancial incentives for setting up of high-tech industries that will be sustainable even when the \nCONG reserves are completely depleted. \n \nBackground to CONG exploitation in Nigeria \n \nThe social development of any nation and its economic sustainability are related directly to the \nlevel of participation of local entrepreneurs in the key economic and industrial activities, such \nas CONG exploration and production, agriculture, commerce, industry, tourism, transportation, \ncommunications, power generation and steel manufacture. Direct participation and \ninvolvement of local contractors in these activities could serve as a boost to the local economy \nthrough the creation of employment, improved infrastructure in society and raised standard-of-\nliving. CONG exploration, production, refining and marketing in Nigeria contributes over 85% \nof the national income [4]. However, these operations, in over 40 years of existence, have, \nfrom instigation, been largely undertaken by cartel-type organizations, with only low levels of \nindigenous-contractor participation. Major activities, e.g. exploration, drilling, production, well \nintervention and service provision have been exploited, controlled and managed by foreign \nmulti-national companies. Only relatively minor contracts have been awarded to local \nentrepreneurs [5]. The consequence of this is a massive (>109 US$ per year) \u2018capital flight\u2019 out \nof Nigeria via the remuneration of foreign expatriate labour, payment for training and \ndevelopment programmes outside Nigeria, equipment procurement from abroad, and the \nimportation of software and data-monitoring systems which the industry uses. In-spite of the \nnumerous activities in the sector, too little value is added to the local economy, yet extensive \nhigh levels of environmental pollution ensue resulting in the reduction of local sustainability by \nthe destruction of local agriculture, and hence high local-unemployment and economic \ndepression ensue. \n \nTwenty years ago, the levels of government and societal consciousness as well as the \nawareness of malpractices and losses accruing to the citizenry through CONG operations were \nlow. Since then pertinent awareness has risen. The knock-on effects are youth restiveness, \nconflicts, upheavals, hostage taking, and equipment seizures. which result in operation \ndisruptions and lost operating time. These reactions occur often as a result of the venting of \nanger by the local population (in the Niger Delta in particular) induced by perceived injustices. \n \nThere is now a country-wide outcry for the government to facilitate greater indigenous \ninvolvements in the energy harnessing sector as a means of raising the average standard of \nliving. This includes a demand for the government to help create an enabling environment in \nfavour of local contractors through the government\u2019s (i) provision of the desired support \nfacilities (I.e. infrastructure) as well as (ii) instituting an appropriate legal framework and (iii) \nempowering regulatory bodies to restrain undesirable foreign participation and competition in \nthe CONG sector. The government can, if it so chooses, intervene in the private sector by (i) \n5 \nregulating industries that are non-competitive, such as monopolies as well as (ii) encouraging \ncompetition [6]. \n \nToo often, CONG activities in Nigeria have been managed so that the interests of local \ncontractors are sidelined. The process has been plagued with non-transparency, insincerity, \nsharp practices and even corruption by key industrial and local stakeholders. There are only \nlow levels of local financial investment in the sector; with indigenous under-capacity \nutilization, so resulting in an almost complete foreign monopoly. Many local entrepreneurs that \nattempted to participate have become frustrated. The impression exists in Nigeria that CONG \nactivities are too capital intensive and high-technology oriented for local contractors to become \ninvolved. Major multi-national oil-operators have had reasons (e.g. alleged poor reliability and \ninferior technical capability of the workforce to be employed) for awarding jobs preferably to \nforeign service-providers. The opinion of most major oil companies is that \u2018indigenous \ncompanies (and individuals) do not perform well\u2019. The results are (i) fewer opportunities for \nlocal entrepreneurs (ii) job gains for foreign companies with attendant cash flow \nhaemorrhaging from Nigeria and (iii) underemployment of its citizens. Hence Nigerians have \nto disprove such prevalent existing opinions and show that local labour and companies are \ncompetent to serve the CONG industry. A wiser management aimed at upgrading by education \nand training, the local content in the CONG industry would serve the Nigerian economy well. \nIt would be an effective method of empowerment of local contractors and could serve as a \npropelling instrument for a significant industrial take-off nationally. If more indigenous \nentrepreneurs become established, even the export of local technical expertise and services \nmay occur.  \n \nAspirations and targets with respect to increased local-content realization \n \nThe Nigerian government hopes, expressed since AD1997, are [7]: \n \n\u2022 All exploration and production (E & P) activities it was hoped would achieve a minimum \nof 30% local content for the procured services and products by AD2003 (but not achieved) \nand 50% by AD2010. \n\u2022 Indigenous companies must capture, and be seen to be gaining, an increasing share of \ngoods and services delivered to the CONG sector in Nigeria. \n\u2022 Pertinent technological knowledge must be transferred to Nigerian citizens so that local \ncapability is improved. \n \nHistorical review \n \nThe CONG sector is the major contributor to the Nigerian economy, accounting for about 90% \nof the federal government\u2019s annual revenues. Any changes to the CONG industry must not be \nallowed to impair this. The industry includes all firms engaged in petroleum exploration, \nproduction, refining, distribution and marketing as well as petrochemicals manufacture. \nUpstream activities [3] relate to the exploration and production of CONG, i.e. from drilling the \ninitial appraisal wells, through seismic data processing, to drilling of wells and extraction of \ncrude oil, condensates, natural gas or associated gas from the well. Historically, foreign firms \nhave dominated the upstream sector of the Nigerian CONG industry. Downstream activities \nrelate to the transportation of CONG and their derivatives as well as their transformation into \n6 \nfinished products and their distribution and marketing. The downstream sector like its upstream \ncounterpart, is beginning to involve Nigerian nationals. \n \nThe crude oil industry in Nigeria began in AD1908 when the associated exploration activity \nwas carried out by the German Bitumen Corporation. In 1937, an Oil Prospecting Licence \n(OPL) was granted to Shell-D\u2019 Arcy\u2019s exploration organisation. In 1955, Mobil Exploration \nNigeria Incorporated obtained concessions over the whole of the then Northern region of \nNigeria. Crude oil was first found in commercial quantities at Oloibiri in the Niger Delta \n(1956) and further discoveries, at Afam and Boma, established Nigeria as a significant oil-\nexporting country with its first shipment of 5000 barrels of crude oil being old on the \ninternational market ensuing in 1958 [4]. \n \nIn 1961, Mobil Exploration Nigeria drilled three deep wells in western Nigeria, but later \nabandoned the concession [4]. In the same year, the Nigerian government granted ten oil-\nprospecting licenses on the continental shelf (i.e. off-shore) to five foreign companies: Shell-\nBP, Mobil Exploration Nigeria Incorporated, AMOSEA, Texaco Mineral Company and \nNigerian Gulf Oil Company, subject then to the payment of one million naira (two million \n$US) each. \n \nRegardless of the increasing activities in the CONG industry, since its inception in Nigeria, it \nhas been dominated by foreign multi-nationals companies. Nevertheless, in keeping with the \npolicy of actively participating in the activities of the leading sectors, the federal government \nhas acquired a controlling equity interest in the Nigerian oil industry. Recently, the federal \ngovernment has also become preoccupied with ensuring the occurrence of increased \ninvolvement of local companies in the activities of the sector. In 1982, the retailing of products \nfrom CONG industries in Nigeria, which hitherto were firmly in the hands of major multi-\nnational oil-companies, was deregulated to permit participation of nine independent marketers.  \n \nDuring the period AD1970-2002, local operators and service providers started to participate in \ncapital-intensive high-technology CONG operations in Nigeria. In 1990, a reinvigorated \nindigenous operatorship programme was initiated through the allocation of blocks to \nindigenous companies that operate on a sole-risk basis. However, the inputs of local firms in \nproviding services are in total still less than 10% [7]. In furtherance of the objective to boost \nindigenous participation, the federal government, through the Nigerian National Petroleum \nCorporation (NNPC), recently directed all major multi-national companies to reserve certain \npositions and services for pertinently-qualified Nigerians and local firms. For example, the \nCorporation ordered that projects requiring the supply of drilling fluid, mud-slide controls, \ncasing or tubing services as well as wire-line completion be awarded only to Nigerian \ncompanies [7]. The dominant argument has been that effective Nigerian participation in the \nCONG sector could turn the industry from the current enclave to one that is effectively linked \nwith the general economy. A multiplier effect should arise as result of the bonanza of having \nsuch rich indigenous resources of CONG.  \n \nThe group managing director of NAPIMS, at a Shell sponsored workshop, stated: \u2018We will \ncontinue to support innovative ideas that seek to improve the contracting procedure, increased \ntransparency and local participation to reduce the costs of goods and services, and aid in the \nresolution of social problems in the industry\u2019. However multi-national operators have been \nwidely criticized for not providing sufficient opportunities to local contractors despite many \nthat exist in the sector, though, the problem is far from one sided. Indigenous participation \n7 \nneeds to go far beyond the award of small contracts [8]. Aret Adams, a one time petroleum \nadviser to the President of Nigeria, summarized it when he described local content as \u2018an idea \nwhose time has come\u2019. However Table 1 shows the distribution of contracts among local and \nforeign contractors by Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) of Nigeria. Table 2 \nshows the relative cumulative production outputs of indigenous and multi-national operators in \nNigeria. \n \nTable 1: Distribution of contracts among local and foreign contractors by the SPDC, Nigeria in \nAD2004 \n \n%  in bpd Type of Contractor \nValue, without EPC \ntaken into account \nValue, of EPC Number \nLocal 56 30 80 \nForeign 44 70 20 \n \n \nTable 2:  Past and proposed future comparative outputs (estimated via barrels of crude oil per \nday) between local and foreign contractors in the CONG sector in Nigeria \n \nInput (% of total) Period \nLocal Foreign \n2001 2 98 \n2002 8 92 \n2010 50 50 \n \nPotential investment opportunities, available to local and foreign individuals or organisations \n(e.g. Nigerian banks) in the CONG sector of Nigeria includes those for:- \n \n\u2022 Manufacturing facilities to produce materials and artefacts for the oil-field operations e.g., \ndrilling clays, chemicals, plastics, pipes, bolts, nuts, screw gaskets, valves, pans and \naccessories. \n\u2022 Local engineering, construction, and fabrication. \n\u2022 Refining and petrochemical plants. \n\u2022 The construction and operation of export-oriented refineries and LPG plants. \n\u2022 Facilities requiring the construction of systems for natural-gas gathering and distribution. \n\u2022 IPPs utilizing flared or associated gases from hydrocarbon operations. \n\u2022 Indigenous exploration and production firms. \n \nInvestment opportunity activities that could achieve a Nigerian content \nincrease in a deregulated downstream sector \n \n\u2022 Transportation: (a) pipeline provision and maintenance; (b) ocean-going vessels, tug boats \nand barges; (c) rail transportation; and (d) overland tankers. \nStorage terminals and bunkering \n\u2022 Natural-gas processing and marketing. \n\u2022 Bunkering. \n\u2022 Retail outlets. \n8 \n\u2022 Oil trading. \n\u2022 Brokerage services \n\u2022 Ancillary services: (a) engineering; procurement and construction; (b) safety and \nenvironment; (c) reliability and maintenance services; (d) security services \n\u2022 Other associated services: - (a) financial; and (b) insurance \n Indigenous Service-Companies\u2019 Opportunities \n \nBusiness challenges (some of which have already been undertaken successfully by Nigerian \ncompanies) for local contractors in the CONG sector:- \n \n\u2022 Drilling and well services.  \n\u2022 CONG engineering consultancy and design. \n\u2022 Civil and structural engineering. \n\u2022 Pipeline coating, construction and corrosion management. \n\u2022 Engineering, procurement, installation, and construction (EPIC) services for on-shore \nCONG facilities. \n\u2022 Maintenance and operations services (for compressors\/pumps, diving and underwater \ninspections, dredging, etc.). \n\u2022 Manufacture of wellhead and process-control systems. \n\u2022 Fabrication (e.g. of house-boats, mobile units and process items).  \n\u2022 Procurement and legal advice (e.g. for port services, vendor representation, and liaison \nservices). \n\u2022 Environmental protection and testing services. \n\u2022    Logistics support (with respect to supply vessels, transportation and facilities management). \n \nLocal content & service quality milestones \n \nThe traditional complaint against the use of an indigenous workforce and artefacts \nmanufactured in Nigeria was the low standards achieved. However recently, and increasingly \nso, Nigerian companies have complied with International Standard Organization (ISO) quality \nrequirements. For instance:- \n\u2022 NETCO, has satisfied ISO 9001: 1994 QMS as certified by the United Kingdom \nAccreditation Scheme, UKAS. \n\u2022 Cakasa Ltd achieved ISO 9001:1994 QMS certification on 21st October    2001 by UKAS. \n\u2022 Cakasa Ltd was awarded ISO 9001:2000 QMS certifications on 20th June 2003 by UKAS.  \n\u2022 Several more indigenous service providers e.g., Sowsco Well Services, are pursuing ISO \nquality management certifications. \n \nInnovations introduced by indigenous service-providers in the CONG sector in Nigeria \ninclude:- \n\u2022 First deep off-shore directional drilling ever done on an oil well in Nigeria.

Limited). \n \nFactors leading to the present low-level of local participation in the CONG \nsector of Nigeria \n \n\u2022 Lack of a stimulating government regulatory framework. \n\u2022 Corruption and mismanagement or opaque accountability \n\u2022 Major oil companies attitudes. \n\u2022 Deficient infrastructural facilities. \n\u2022 Lack of appropriate materials. \n\u2022 Institutional problems \n\u2022 Absence of adequate appropriate financing. \n\u2022 Unstable and even volatile political and economic environments in Nigeria.  \n \nImpediments to the growth of local content in the CONG sector in Nigeria.  \n \n\u2022 Failure of local contractors to fulfil basic prerequisites; e.g. the provision of detailed and \nauthenticated banking proposals, comprehensive business plans, legally-binding quotations, \nagreed delivery deadlines, and having adequate finance available to achieve what is \npromised. \n\u2022 Low equity-base of local contractors. \n\u2022 High costs of borrowing in the domestic economy. \n\u2022 Scanty or lack of financial documentation, particularly audited accounts. \n\u2022 High risk-rating occasioned by recurrent community disturbances. \n\u2022 Lack of ready access to foreign currency. \n\u2022 Single obligation limitation\/constraints imposed on local banks by regulation. \n\u2022 Excessively long gestation\/courtship\/completion periods both in securing and executing oil \ncontracts. \n \nHowever there are increasingly-available financial options and opportunities for local \ncontractors in the CONG sector in Nigeria: for example via:- \n \n\u2022 Consortium financing: a group of banks led by an agent bank to provide the necessary \nfunding. \n\u2022 Term loan: a single facility for a given period or series of facilities at given dates. \n\u2022 Credit line: a short-term facility that must be repaid or renewed within one year. \n\u2022 Advances: a single loan with a maturity period not exceeding 90 days. \n\u2022 Overdrafts: a situation where a bank honours a cheque drawn on a non-existent fund. \n\u2022 Invoice discounting: selling accounts receivables to a financial institution on a non-\nrecourse basis. \n\u2022 Equipment leasing:  an agreement between the equipment owner or lessor and its user or \nlessee. \nBenefits of equipment leasing to local contractors in the CONG sector in Nigeria include: \n \n\u2022 Eliminates immediate financial burden involved in the outright purchase of expensive high-\ntech oil-field equipment. \n10 \n\u2022 Flexible payment plan reduces cash-flow pressures on working capital. \n\u2022 Provides a hedge against technological obsolescence. \n\u2022 Less restrictive form of financing, as it does not tie up the lessee\u2019s accessibility to other \nfinancial options. \n\u2022 Off-balance sheet advantage of leasing can be used to give a better impression of the \ncompany\u2019s financial position. \n \nLoan applications by local contractors \n \nThe following are the minimum bank requirements imposed upon Nigerian contractors in need \nof a loan from Nigerian banks:  \n\u2022 A satisfactory company profile. \n\u2022 A trustworthy global-banking relationship. \n\u2022 Satisfactory latest three years\u2019 audited accounts. \n\u2022 Favourable outcome of recent management account. \n\u2022 Encouraging statement of affairs in the case of a start-up company. \n\u2022 Detailed financial projections (including a balance sheet, income statement and cash-flow \nforecast). \n\u2022 Clear company business strategy and focus. \n\u2022 Formal request for the credit facility. \n\u2022 Availability of sufficient security for the requested facility. \n\u2022 Acceptable repayment schedule for the request. \nWhy credit requests by local contractors are so often rejected by the banks. \n \n\u2022  Lack of integrity e.g. presentation of phoney invoices for discounting. \n\u2022 Bad track-records lead to low credit ratings. \n\u2022 Weak balance sheets or un-audited accounts. \n\u2022  Lack of collateral security. \n \nSurvey of Opinions \n \nQuestionnaire replies were received from 100 participants of why there is a relatively low local \ncontent in the CONG sector in Nigeria: a summary of their opinions now follows:- \n \n\u2022 Regardless of the numerous opportunities for local entrepreneurs, local participation has \nbeen limited mainly to the award of minor contracts and services.  \n\u2022 The level of indigenous participation in AD 2004 was put at less than 10% by 76 \nrespondents. \n\u2022 The high level of awareness of the issue of local content by Nigerian entrepreneurs and \ncompany owners has not led to a significant number of corresponding remedial actions \nbeing implemented.  \n\u2022 Most respondents believe that mergers\/partnering among Nigerian firms could facilitate \novercoming most of the inhibitions preventing increased local content.  \n\u2022 Equipment leasing is a good financial option that could be exploited by local contractors to \nlimit their immediate cash-burden resulting from equipment purchases.   \n\u2022 There are neither (i) pertinent laws to back government policies nor (ii) directives intended \nto increase local content.  \n11 \n\u2022 Lack of adequate finance, insufficient pertinent technical expertise and unhelpful multi-\nnational company\u2019s attitude are impediments that should be removed. \n\u2022 An improved educational infrastructure is needed. \n \nConclusions \n \n\u2022 Alleged corporate and governmental corruption has severely inhibited investment in \nNigeria. \n\u2022 Businesses tend to go to places where they can make profits: factors such as excessive \npolitical interference, inadequate infrastructure in the local society, political instability, \ncorruption, interruptible electricity supplies etc discourage investment. \n\u2022 Corruption free procurement processes should be employed \n\u2022 All contracts should be able to be seen and understood by the government, whose role \nshould be to fight against poverty of all its citizens: the weak should not be allowed to be \nexploited by the strong! \n\u2022 Nigeria (with its vast natural-resources) is potentially very rich, but it needs now to protect \nand foster (increasingly sustainable) industries, which are locally owned and run by \nNigerians, in order to encourage high rates of indigenous employment. Now is the time to \nstart preparing for when the oil wells run dry! \n\u2022 Wiser, zero-corruption tolerant governance is needed for all activities in Nigeria. \n\u2022 Nigeria is a leading country in Africa with respect to embracing market economics: trade \nrather than aid provides a sustainable means of overcoming deprivation. \n\u2022 There is a lack of high-quality entrepreneurial skills available in Nigeria. The Government \nneeds to provide financial \u201cseed com\u201d to small and medium sized Nigerian firms to help \nthem improve their skills in research, design, development, manufacturing, quality control \nand marketing. \n\u2022 Greater indigenous participation and ownership of scientific and high-technology \nenterprises are needed: then Nigerians will become more involved with priority setting, \nvocational education and entrepreneurship in order to solve local problems. \n\u2022 An increased participation of local entrepreneurs and workers in the activities of the CONG \nsector is desirable for Nigerian development and economic improvement.  \n\u2022 The government needs to encourage (i) more multi-national enterprises (MNEs) to set-up \nin Nigeria and (ii) decreases in bureaucracy, thereby enhancing indigenous technological \ncapability and industrial competitiveness. However, these trends will not ensue \nautomatically when faced with market forces and trade liberalisation. Hence the recent \nintroduction (it is hoped for a short-term only) of protective government policies (e.g. \nmandatory increases of local content) should run in parallel with far better education and \ntraining opportunities for Nigerian citizens.  \n\u2022 Local participation will facilitate economic growth and national development through (i) a \nreduction in capital \u201cflight\u201d abroad, (ii) employment generation, (iii) local skills \nenhancement, (iv) creation of a better infrastructure in society, and (v) value-added to the \nlocal economy. \n\u2022 The involvement of local entrepreneurs has remained low. Several factors ranging from a \nlack of finance, discouraging environment, unsympathetic legal-framework, inadequate \ninfrastructure, attitude of multi-national companies, and assumptions of local contractors \nhave contributed to this. \n\u2022 Available records show that few indigenous contractors have set sufficiently high \nstandards. \n12 \n\u2022 To work effectively with multi-national organisations, changes in some indigenous \npractices such as the African concept of \u2018elastic\u2019 time (where, quite reasonably, buses leave \nwhen full and not according to a timetable) has to be effected. \n\u2022 The lower labour cost incurred should be an incentive to employ more Nigerians rather \nthan expatriate workers. \n \nIn addition, it is acknowledged that the CONG industry and the government in Nigeria should:- \n\u2022 encourage and educate local entrepreneurs concerning the available business opportunities \nin the CONG industry in Nigeria; \n\u2022 create a \u201ccan-do\u201d employment and infrastructure for the local population; \n\u2022 create a direct link between increasing CONG activities and local economic growth; the \nCONG sector has so far remained an isolated enclave within the economy; \n\u2022 train and develop local manpower in key technical and commercial activities of the CONG \nsector in preparation for a complete take over of the management of the sector by Nigerians \nin the medium-term; \n\u2022 encourage technology transfer locally and re-position the local manufacturing sector: to \nfacilitate greater take-up in CONG operations; \n\u2022 facilitate Nigerian personnel aspirations and overcome a dependence attitude\/culture; and \n\u2022 eliminate the wasteful flaring of natural gas from the more than 1000 wells in the Niger \ndelta: this combustion is a major source of greenhouse gases, and a huge financial loss for \nNigerian. \n \nRecommendations \n \n\u2022 Change for the better is achievable provided that those involved are prepared to be \nadaptive. Improvements in Nigeria\u2019s industrial society are realisable, despite many \nentrenched problems, provided the attitudes and thinking of many more Nigerians and \nespecially their leaders are more malleable. Nigeria needs institutions which are stable, \nmore productive and broadly acceptable to society, but sufficiently flexible to adapt rapidly \nin response to changing circumstances! \n\u2022 The Government\u2019s position on the issue of local content should go well beyond pertinent \ndiscussions, communiqu\u00e9s, and issuing directives, actions not just words are required. \nPoliticians and senior managers must be held to greater account. \n\u2022 Monitoring agencies should be empowered to ensure that adequate local content always \noccurs. \n\u2022 The Government should ensure that all activities in the petroleum industry, for which local \ncontractors have been tried, tested and proved to be successful are reserved solely for them. \n\u2022 Technology transfers should be realized by encouraging local contractors, foreign service-\nproviders and the Government to form consortia to ensure that proper training is available, \nand taken up by prospective members of the workforce and potential entrepreneurs. \n\u2022 Multi-national operators and foreign service-providers should ensure that Nigerian \ngovernment stipulated percentages of local content exist in their technical bids and occur \nsubsequently in practice.   \n\u2022 Local entrepreneurs should be encouraged to put their efforts and resources together, either \nas joint ventures, cooperative enterprises or new limited liability companies, with such \nentities registered under a special job category. \n13 \n\u2022 Multi-national operators should show commitment by ensuring regular and prompt \npayments to local contractors for services rendered, and also provide continuous work \nrotation packages to new local entities. \n\u2022 A meaningful engagement in harnessing the vitality and commitment of Nigerian youths in \non-going projects will facilitate creating a calm, hospitable, and safer operating \nenvironment. \n\u2022 National workshops and seminars are important for the education of the citizens concerning \nthe local content including available opportunities in the E & P sector for local \nentrepreneurs. \n\u2022 A Government incentive scheme should be evolved to encourage local contractors by \nrewarding them for outstanding performances.  \n\u2022 The destiny of the Nigerian CONG industry should be under Nigerian governance. \n \nReferences \n \n[1] Nwasike, O.T.
