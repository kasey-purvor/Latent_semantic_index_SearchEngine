Volovik\nReview by P.V.E. McClintock of CPH\/2002\/001398\nPhysicists should only embark on Grisha Volovik\u2019s book when feeling strong. This is not\nso much on account of its size \u2013 500 pages arranged in 32 chapters divided into 7 sections,\nplus Conclusions \u2013 but because they will find some of their most cherished beliefs being\nseverely challenged.\nThe author brings together three huge areas of physics, points out what they possess\nin common, and uses what is well understood in one area to illuminate what remains\nunknown in another. He takes the coldest macroscopic physical system (superfluid he-\nlium), together with the hottest one on which experiments can be performed (elementary\nparticles), and the almost inconceivably hot (cosmology just after the Big Bang), and\nweaves them together theoretically into a coherent whole. He starts from the hypothesis\nthat low energy properties are governed mainly by topology and symmetry, notes that\nthe A-phase of superfluid 3He is topologically very similar to the quantum vacuum of the\nUniverse, and develops the analogy from there. This may sound fanciful, even diletante,\nbut in reality the book is quite otherwise. It is detailed, scholarly, extraordinarily erudite,\nclosely argued, utterly original, and very, very serious.\nConsider superfluid helium (either the common isotope 4He or the much rarer one\n3He) at a very low temperature. It then behaves much like a vacuum, exerting no drag\non a moving object but renormalising its mass. Quasiparticles (e.g. phonons) exist as\ncollective excitations of this vacuum, and travel at a characteristic velocity, that of sound.\nOn this level, the existence of the helium atoms and their mutual interactions is totally\nirrelevant. Practically all properties of the system can be described in terms of an effective\ntheory that takes no account of the microscopic structure: Landau-Khalatnikov theory\nfor 4He and a development of Landau Fermi liquid theory for 3He. At the lowest energies,\nthe atomic structure is relevant only in that it determines \u201cfundamental\u201d constants such\nas the velocity of sound u. Yet liquid helium can also (albeit with effort) be described\nat a deeper level, in terms of the inter-atomic potential: this would represent a Theory\nof Everything (ToE) for helium. In these terms, properties like sound propagation and\nsuperfluidity would be seen as \u201cemergent phenomena\u201d that would be hard to predict from\nthe ToE.\nThe similar symmetries of superfluid 3He-A and the Universe mean that there are close\ncorrespondences between the topological defects of both these vacua. Cosmic strings,\nmonopoles, domain walls, solitons etc in the Universe have their helium counterparts\nas quantized vortices, hedgehogs, domain walls, solitons, etc. in the superfluid. Unlike\nthe quantum vacuum of the Universe, however, we already have a ToE that in principle\nunderlies all phenomena in superfluid 3He-A. So in the latter case we can look at the\nproblem from both directions. Volovik\u2019s idea is that this detailed understanding can pro-\nvide insight and enhanced perspective on the Universe. He develops the helium\/universe\nanalogy in great detail and, remarkably \u2013 or perhaps unsurprisingly given their close cor-\nrespondences in symmetry \u2013 finds that Lorentz invariance and almost all the features of\nthe Standard Model emerge at low energies.\nThe analogy also offers an astonishingly simple explanation of the problem of the\ncosmological constant \u2013 which is smaller than expected theoreticaly by many orders of\nmagnitude. Volovik points out that, for helium, the vacuum energy can be either positive\nor negative, depending on whether it is a gas or a liquid with a surface. If the Universe is\n1\nPublished in Contemp. Phys. 45, 187-188 (2004).\npictured as being like a quantum liquid in equilibrium, its vacuum energy must vanish \u2013\nunless it is a droplet, in which case there will be surface corrections scaling inversely with\nthe size of the droplet. Vacuum dark pressure, which is measured by the cosmological\nconstant, indeed scales as the inverse square of the size of the Universe.\nNote that, in the effective theory of superfluid helium, u plays the role of a fundamental\nconstant. But, for the ToE, u is not fundamental at all. Rather, the fundamental constants\nof the ToE could be taken as h\u00af, \u01eb0 and r0 to specify the depth\/size of the Lennard-\nJones potential, and the helium atomic mass m. But two of these so-called fundamental\nconstants, \u01eb0 and r0, can of course be determined from a yet more fundamental ToE,\natomic physics, for which the fundamental constants are h\u00af, the electronic charge e and\nthe electronic mass m\ne\n. In turn, e and m\ne\nare determined by an even higher energy\nToE, the Standard Model of particle physics. Volovik comments: \u201cSuch a hierarchy of\n\u2018fundamental constants\u2019 indicates that the ultimate set of fundamental constants probably\ndoes not exist at all.\u201d\nVolovik infers that we exist in the low-energy corner of a larger and more complex\nreality. In the same way that an imaginary entity \u201cliving\u201d in superfluid 3He-A could\npredict all easily observable phenomena from Landau Fermi liquid theory, without needing\nto know anything whatever about molecular or atomic or sub-atomic physics, all of our\ntheorising to date including relativity and the Standard Model may just represent effective\ntheories. Some implications of this approach are: that because gravitation is just an\neffective theory, there is not much to be gained by quantising it; that Lorentz invariance\nis another low-energy feature and a non-relativistic regime will emerge at high enough\nenergies; that the velocity of light may not be fundamental (any more than the velocity of\nsound in the superfluid vacuum is fundamental); and that the equivalence principle and\ngauge invariance are probably inexact.\nIt is impossible in a few lines to do justice to a work of scientific imagination on the scale\nthat Volovik has produced. It provides his personal perspective of the physical Universe,\nworked out in quantitative detail, of which only a few samples have been mentioned briefly\nabove. Is he right? Only time will tell, but many of his arguments have the ring of truth\nabout them for me. His picture taken as a whole is a coherent vision that fits well most of\nthe facts that are known from experiment. At the very least the breadth of this vision is\nrefreshing and highly thought provoking. In his Foreword, James Bjorken remarks: \u201cSo\nfar, this is not respectable territory, so there is danger to the young researcher in venturing\nwithin \u2013 working on it may be detrimental to a successful career track...\u201d! But he also\ncomments on the high adventure and great rewards if the ideas turn out to be correct. If\nthey are, we will all need to start rethinking our own perspectives of the Universe.\nPeter V.E.
