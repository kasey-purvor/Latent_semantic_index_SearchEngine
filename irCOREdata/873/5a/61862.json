Evolutionary change in \nresponse to human activities is best documented in harvested systems where selective removal \nof large individuals by fishers, hunters and plant harvesters rapidly reduces mean body size \nand mean age at maturity (Haugen2001)(Conover2002)(Coltman2003)(Law2005)\n(Edeline2007#1611). Maybe due to a focus on mean trait values, harvest-induced selection is \nalmost systematically equated to strict size truncation, i.e., the removal of all individuals \nlarger than a limit size (J\u00f8rgensen2007)(Conover2002)(Berkeley2004)(Hutchings2005)\n(Hsieh2006)(Hutchings2008), and many of the negative effects of harvesting to population \npersistence and recovery are ascribed to size truncation (Berkeley2004)(Hsieh2006)\n(Hutchings2008). Truncation selection against large individuals is particularly detrimental to \nexploited populations because older and larger individuals often produce more and higher \nquality offspring than younger, smaller individuals (Berkeley2004)(Hutchings2005). Hence, \nselective harvesting of large individuals affects population rate of increase more negatively \nthan would do random harvesting. Additionally, truncation selection erodes genetic variance \n(Roff1997) and could thus cause irreversible trait changes because genetic variability is \nnecessary for selection to act on (Hutchings2008). In particular, artificial size truncation \nacting in directional opposition with natural selection (Edeline2007#1611) might induce a \nmore severe reduction in body size variance compared to size truncation acting alone \n(Conover2009). However, most often the exact form of harvest-induced selection is unknown \nand the effect of harvesting on trait variability remains unexplored. \nRecent studies in Gulf of Saint Lawrence cod Gadus morhua (Sinclair2002#1148) and \nWindermere pike Esox lucius (Carlson2007#1537) show that fishery-induced selection is not \nnecessarily truncation selection but can instead be disruptive selection. Disruptive selection \nPage 3 of 26\noccurs when individuals with intermediate trait values (here body size) have lower fitness \nthan individuals with extreme trait values (Roff1997)(Carlson2007#1537), and disruptive \nfishing arises from gear selectivity and\/or segregation of fish on fishing grounds by size and \nage. Theory predicts that disruptive selection, in contrast to truncation selection, should \nincrease phenotypic variance, genetic variance and population adaptability. Here we use \nunique data from the Windermere long-term ecological experiment (Le_Cren2001)\n(Winfield2008) to link changes in the strength of disruptive selection from a gillnet scientific \nfishery to changes in phenotypic variability of Windermere pike. We show that, as predicted \nby the theory, disruptive fishery selection is associated with increased phenotypic variance in \npike somatic growth and size-at-age. \nWindermere is a glacial valley lake of the English Lake District (Northwest UK) that \nhas been under extensive scientific monitoring since decades (see Materials and Methods). \nNatural and fishery-induced selection act in direct opposition on Windermere pike body size \n(Carlson2007#1537). We illustrate this antagonism between natural and fishery selection in \nTable 1 and figure 1a, which were built using the same data and methods as Carlson et al. \n(2007) but with a different grouping structure for data (see Materials and Methods). Natural \nselection acting on Windermere pike body size is stabilizing (intermediate-sized pike have the \nhighest survival probability, Table 1 and figure 1a), became increasingly stabilising over time \n(figure 1a), and the naturally selected body size optimum is larger than the population mean \nso that the directional selection gradient is positive (Table 1). The stabilizing form of natural \nselection presumably reflects the combined effects of cannibalism (Le_Cren1987)\n(Haugen2007) and senescence (note that owing to fish asymptotic growth, natural selection \nacting on age is less stabilizing than natural selection acting on body length \n(EdelineSubmitted)). In contrast, scientific fishery selection is disruptive (Table 1 and figure \nPage 4 of 26\n1a), became less disruptive over time (figure 1a), and the fitness valley is also larger than the \npopulation mean so that the resulting selection gradient is negative (Table 1). Changes in \nmean pike somatic growth were driven by the directional antagonism between the two \nselective forces (Edeline2007#1611). From 1944 to 1963, the strength of fishery selection \ndominated over the strength of natural selection, resulting in decreased mean individual \nsomatic growth. During this period, exploitation rate increased and the fishery annually \nremoved from 1.1 to 7.3 % (mean 3.3%) of the pike population. From 1963 to 1993, \nexploitation rate decreased (from 4.95 to 0.13 %, mean 1.1 %) and fishery selection was \noverridden by natural selection, triggering a rapid increase in mean pike somatic growth. \nThese results have shown that the dominant selective force determined the position of the \nphenotypic optimum (i.e., drove movements of the adaptive peak on the adaptive landscape). \nHere our aim was to investigate whether the dominant selective force also drove peak \nsharpness around the phenotypic optimum (i.e., drove the curvature of the adaptive \nlandscape). We predicted that the dominance of fishery selection over natural selection up the \nearly 1960's should have imposed a concave adaptive landscape and thus favoured an increase \nin pike phenotypic variance. In contrast, the dominance of natural selection over fishery \nselection after the early 1960's should have imposed a convex adaptive landscape and thus \nfavoured a decrease in pike phenotypic variance. Our results support these predictions.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSampling site and data collection\nPike in Windermere have been sampled each year since 1944 as part of a long-term scientific \nmonitoring program (Winfield2008)(Le_Cren2001). A spring (March-April) component of \nthis sampling was designed to capture a large size range of pike using shore seines, perch \nPage 5 of 26\ntraps, and 46 and 64 mm gillnets. Note that reduced catchability of larger fish might have \ninfluenced our estimation of the shape of natural mortality in Fig. 1a. Captured pike were all \nmeasured for total body length (to the nearest cm), tagged and released. Resulting catch-mark-\nrecapture (CMR) data have been extensively described in two recent papers (Haugen2006)\n(Haugen2007). As part of the scientific program, pike were also sampled in winter (October-\nFebruary) in a gillnet fishery (64 mm mesh size) which targeted pike longer than 54 cm \n(Frost1967). All pike captured in the winter fishery were killed, sexed, measured for total \nbody length (to the nearest cm) and the opercular bones were removed for age and length \nbackcalculation following a validated method (Frost1959). Bone density differs between \nsummer and winter, producing narrow bands (\"checks\") that are deposited on the opercular \nbones during the slow winter growth period. These checks then serve as an annual mark and, \nthus, allow the aging of individual fish (Frost1959). An individual\u2019s length is back-calculated \nat each age using a relationship between the radius of the opercular bone at each check and \nbody length (Frost1959). Windermere surface water temperatures (in \u00b0C) were recorded on a \nnear daily basis and were here averaged for each year. Finally, the abundance of pike and \nperch (Perca fluvialitis, the main food for pike) have been estimated annually for the 1944-\n1995 period, separately for each basin as well as separately for young (age = 2) and old \nindividuals (age > 2) (des_Clers1994).\nThe form and strength of selection\nWe estimated the form of selection from survival instead of total fitness \n(survival*reproductive success) because (1) no data exists for pike reproductive success, (2) \nan approximation of reproductive success by fecundity can be made only for female pike \nbecause no data exists for fecundity in male pike, and (3) female survival is by far more \nPage 6 of 26\ncritical to population growth than female fecundity in Windermere pike (EdelineSubmitted). \nWe quantified the age-specific strength and form of natural and fishery-induced selection \nacting on Windermere pike body size (Table 1, figures 1a and 1b) using previously described \nprocedures based on logistic regressions (Carlson2007#1537). In the CMR data an individual \npike tagged in spring of year t was considered to have survived through the summer of year t \n(survival = 1) if recaptured at any point in time after the summer of year t. This assumption \nhas been validated (Carlson2007#1537). In contrast, a fish that was never recaptured after the \nsummer of year t was attributed a survival of 0 for this summer. In the fishery data, fish were \ngiven a survival of 0 for age and size at capture, and a survival of 1 for previous \nbackcalculated ages and sizes (Sinclair2002#1148). In Table 1, estimates of directional \nselection gradients acting on body length were obtained using logistic regressions of survival \non standardized body length (zero mean and SD of unity), and quadratic selection gradients \nwere obtained using logistic regressions of survival on standardized body length plus its \nsquared term (Janzen1998). We estimated age-specific selection gradients in Table 1 by \nbreaking both datasets into age classes. In the CMR dataset, because only recaptured fish \nwere aged we produced age classes based on the minimum and maximum body lengths of \neach age-class in the fishery data. For instance, backcalculated length-at-age-1 ranged from \n14 to 38 cm, and all fish of length-at-capture ranging from 14 to 38 cm were attributed age 1 \nin the CMR data. In figures 1a and 1b, we visualized the form of the pike adaptive landscape \nusing natural cubic splines with 9 knots in logistic generalized additive models (mgcv library \nof the R software (R_Development_Core_Team2008)(Wood2006)(Carlson2007#1537)), i.e., \nthere was no a priori assumption about the form of selection. Finally, to model survival as a \nfunction of somatic growth in figure 1b, survival at age t was considered relative to length \nPage 7 of 26\nincrease between age t-1 and age t, and only fish of length-at-age-t-1 >54 cm were included in \nthe analysis.\nMaximum likelihood estimates of unbiased means and variances\nObserved somatic growth distributions in each year class might be distorted pictures of \ndistributions at birth due to natural selection prior to the catch and due to the selectivity of the \ncatch itself. We modeled such possible sampling biases using selection functions from figure \n1a as filters to backward estimate unbiased somatic growth rate distributions from sampled \ndistributions. Individual pike lifetime somatic growth rate gi was equated to von Bertalanffy's \nasymptotic length (Edeline2007#1611), which was computed using a nonlinear restricted \nmaximum likelihood (REML) mixed-effects model with a random individual effect in the \nnlme library of the R software (Pinheiro2000)(R_Development_Core_Team2008). Briefly, \nWindermere pike growth is best described by the 3 parameters von Bertalanffy growth curve \n(VBGC) (Ratkowsky1990):\nl g i t=g i\u2212\ue09e2.93\ue083g i\ue09f\u00d70.698\nt Eq.1,\nwhere l g i t is the length-at-age-t of fish i of asymptotic length gi, and -2.93 and 0.698 are \nconstants estimated by nonlinear least squares fitting of the VBGC on the whole population. \nTo compute gi, Eq.1 was incorporated into a REML linear mixed effects model in which gi \nwas associated to a random individual effect bi so that gi = \u03b20 + bi, where \u03b20 was model \nintercept (i.e., population's g). The survival probability of fish i at age t through natural \nselection (probability s \ue09el g i t\ue09f ) and through fishery selection (probability f \ue09el gi t\ue09f ) are \nknown from survival functions (figure 1a). To be caught at age ci, a given fish i has to survive \nPage 8 of 26\nselection (probability product s \ue09el g i t\ue09f f \ue09el gi t\ue09f ) for ci \u2013 1 years, and then to survive natural \nselection one more year before being caught (with probability s \ue09elg i t\ue09f\u00d7\ue09e1\u2212 f \ue09el g i t\ue09f\ue09f ). The \nlikelihood of the particular life history of fish i can thus be written:\nL \ue09em ,v\u2223g i\ue09f=Pr \ue09eg i\u2223m , v \ue09f=\nb \ue09eg i\u2223m ,v \ue09f\u00d7[\u220f\nt=1\nc i\u22121\ns \ue09el g i t\ue09f f \ue09el gi t\ue09f]\u00d7s \ue09el gi c i\ue09f\u00d7[1\u2212 f \ue09el gi c i\ue09f]\nSurv \ue09em ,v , c i\ue09f\nEq.2,\nwhere m and v are the estimated mean and variance of the normally distributed asymptotic \nlengths in the population before selection, b(gi| m,v) is the probability for an individual of \nasymptotic length gi to be born in a population of mean m and variance v for g. Surv(m, v, ci) \nis the expected survival rate until age of capture ci in the whole population such that:\nSurv \ue09em ,v , c i\ue09f=\u222b b\ue09eg\u2223m ,v \ue09f\u00d7[\u220f\nt=1\nci\u22121\ns \ue09el g t \ue09f f \ue09el g t\ue09f]\u00d7s \ue09el gci\ue09f\u00d7[1\u2212 f \ue09el gci\ue09f] dg\nEq.3.\nThe full model, including all N sampled fish, allows the mean and the variance of the \npopulation to be independently estimated for each year class. There are thus two vectors of \nparameters to estimate: M = (m1944, m1945,... m1993) and V = (v1944, v1941,... v1993). The form and \nstrength of natural selection and fishery selection were allowed to vary according to time (3 \nperiods from 1944 to 1958, from 1959 to 1969, and from 1970 to 1993, see figure 1a). The \ngeneral likelihood function is: \nL \ue09eM ,V \u2223g 1 .. . g N \ue09f=\u220f\ni=1\nN\nPr \ue09e g i\u2223my i , v y i \ue09f Eq.4,\nPage 9 of 26\nwhere yi is the year class of fish i. Maximum likelihood estimates of reconstructed means and \nvariances, as well as their standard errors, were obtained using the software AD Model \nBuilder (Otto Research Ltd., http:\/\/admb-project.org\/). Reconstructed means were not directly \nrelevant to the present study and are thus provided as an electronic supplementary material \n(figure S1). We validated the method using simulated data (see below). The simulations \nstressed that bias removal necessitates large sample sizes (at least a couple of hundred \nindividuals). For this reason, the analysis of real data has been performed by pooling the \nmeasures in 5-year bins (figures 1d and S1). \nThe model has been checked using simulated data. Simulations were performed with \nthe R software. 50 cohorts of N=100,000 individuals have been simulated during the 1940 to \n1990 period. The growth rate of each individual was sampled from a normal distribution of \ngiven mean and variance. To make sure that the simulations explored the whole range of \nrealistic means and variances, a trend has been simulated (\"theoretical\" lines in figure 2). Each \nindividual of the population then went through a series of survival events; the probability to \nsurvive natural selection and fishery depended on the length of the fish (calculated from its \nage and its asymptotic length gi) and the selection strengths at that time (see figure 1a). If the \nfish was caught (failure to survive the fishery event), it was added to the simulated dataset \n(\"uncorrected\" lines in figure 2). Overall, due to strong juvenile selection, between 500 and \n1000 fishes were \"caught\" every year, which is the same order of magnitude as the real \ndataset. The simulated dataset was analyzed with the same model as the real data to produce \n\"unbiased\" lines in figure 2. Proximity between \"theoretical\" and \"unbiased\" lines in figure 2 \nindicates that our model successfully reconstructed somatic growth rate distributions at birth \nfrom sampled distributions.\nPage 10 of 26\nTrends in residual phenotypic variance\nWe modeled changes in residual variance for pike lifetime somatic growth rate and length-at-\nage while statistically accounting for (i) the plastic effects of temperature and food availability \non pike growth (Winfield2008)(Kipling1983#1819), (ii) changes in average trait values due to \ndirectional selection (Edeline2007#1611), and (iii) temporal trends in residual variance due to \nnonlinear (i.e., disruptive or stabilizing) selection. We used linear REML mixed-effects \nmodels in the nlme library of the R software, which provides built-in functions to explicitly \nmodel variance structure of within-group residuals using covariates (Pinheiro2000). Model \ndetails are provided in Table 2. To estimate changes in variance for pike lifetime somatic \ngrowth rate, we used gi as the response in a REML linear mixed-effects model:\ng ij=\ue0b80\ue083\ue0b81 S i\ue083\ue0b82 Basi\ue083\ue0b83T i\ue083\ue0b84 Ypii\ue083\ue0b85Opi i\ue083\ue0b86 Ype i\ue083\ue0b87 Opei\ue083\ue0b88Yc i\ue083\ue0b89 P i\n\ue083\ue0b810 T i\u00d7Ypii\ue083\ue0b811T i\u00d7Opii\ue083\ue0b812T i\u00d7Ype i\ue083\ue0b813 T i\u00d7Opei\ue083\ue0b814Yc i\u00d7Pi\ue083b j\ue083\ue0bbij\nEq.5,\nwhere \ue0b8 s are model coefficients, and fixed effects covariates are as follows: S=Sex, \nBas=Basin, T=temperature, Ypi=density of young pike (age=2), Opi=density of old pike \n(age>2), Ype=density of young perch, Ope=density of old perch, Yc=Year class (i.e., cohort), \nP=period factor (P1: Period 1 of dominating fishery selection from 1944 to 1963, and P2: \nPeriod 2 of dominating natural selection from 1964 to 1993). Finally, bj is a normally \ndistributed random Yc effect, nested into S, nested into Bas (Table 2 ), and \ue0bbij represents \nnormally distributed within-group residuals. Environmental covariates (T, Ypi, Opi, Ype, Ope) \nwere averaged for each individual i from birth to capture. Interaction between temperature \nand each biological covariate accounted for the thermal dependence of food conversion \nefficiency and predator-prey overlap, and generated a drop of model AIC (Akaike's \nPage 11 of 26\nInformation Criterion) compared to a simple additive formulation. The Yc\u00d7P interaction \naccounted for the effects of directional selection on mean growth rate (Edeline2007#1611). \nWe modeled temporal changes in the variance of \ue0bb ij with two different variance functions. \nFirst, we modeled the residual variance ratio between P1 and P2 :\nvar \ue09e\ue0bb ij \ue09f=a\u00d7\ue0b9 P Eq.6,\nwhere a is within Yc, within S, within Bas residual variance during P1 and \ue0b9 is the \nestimated ratio parameter. Second, we modeled changes in the variance of \ue0bb ij as a power \nfunction of Yc inside each P, while accounting for the variance ratio between P1 and P2: \nvar \ue09e\ue0bb ij \ue09f=b\u00d7\ue0b9 ' P\u00d7\ue09eYc\n\ue0ba \u2223P\ue09f Eq.7,\nwhere b is within Yc, within S, within Bas residual variance in year-class 1944 (i.e., for the \nfirst Yc of P1), \ue0b9 ' is the estimated variance ratio between the first Yc of P1 and the first Yc \nof P2, and \ue0ba is the estimated within-P power parameter. Eq.7 yielded a significantly better \nfit of \ue0bb ij in Eq.5 than Eq.6 (p < 0.05). We modeled temporal changes in variance for natural \nlog-transformed length-at-age-1 to age-6 using 6 age-specific linear REML mixed-effects \nmodels of the form:\nln \ue09eLik \ue09f=\ue0b8 0\ue083\ue0b8 1 S i\ue083\ue0b8 2 Bas i\ue083\ue0b8 3T i\ue083\ue0b8 4 Ypii\n\ue083\ue0b8 5Opi i\ue083\ue0b8 6 Ypei\ue083\ue0b8 7 Opei\ue083\ue0b8 8Yc i\u00d7P i\ue083bk\ue083\ue0bb ik\nEq.8,\nPage 12 of 26\nwhere ln(Lik) is natural log-transformed body length-at-age x of individual i in group k, \ue0b8 s\nare model coefficients, and \ue0bb ij represents normally distributed within-group residuals. \nEnvironmental growth conditions (T, Ypi, Opi, Ype, Ope) were averaged from birth to age x. \nThis simpler formulation of fixed effects (compared to Eq.5) yielded a lower AIC for the \nmajority of ages and was thus retained for all ages for parsimony and consistency. Each \nmodel had a different structure of normally distributed random effect bk, which was selected \namong a set of candidate structures based on model AIC (details provided in Table 2). We \nmodeled changes in the variance of \ue0bbik in Eq.8 with Eq.6 and Eq.7, which yielded a \nsignificantly better model fit than Eq.6 (p < 0.05) for all lengths-at-age except for length-at-\nage-2.\nFinally, estimated parameters \ue0b9 , \ue0b9 ' and \ue0ba from Eq. 6 and Eq.7 inserted in the \nabove-listed models allowed us to quantify percent changes in residuals phenotypic variance \nfor each trait (lifetime somatic growth and 6 lengths-at-age, Table 3). For instance, for gi,\n\ue0b9=0.96 in Eq.6 indicating that residual variance for gi overall decreased by 4% between \nP1 and P2. In Eq.7, \ue0b9 '=1.41 , \ue0ba =0.01 during P1 (19 year-classes), and \ue0ba =\u22120.1\nduring P2 (30 year-classes), indicating that residual variance in gi increased by 3.8% during \nP1 and decreased by 29.6% during P2 (see Table 3 for full results).\nRESULTS\nRaw trends in pike phenotypic variance\nRaw variance in individual pike lifetime somatic growth rate among sampled fish increased \nup to the early 1960s (figure 1c, top panel), in accordance with the prediction that disruptive \nfishery selection on body size simultaneously favoured both slow and fast growers. \nDirectional fishery selection for slow growth and delayed entry to the fishery is self evident \nPage 13 of 26\nand has already been demonstrated (Carlson2007#1537)(Edeline2007#1611). However, \nconcurrent selection for fast growth is less intuitive. Therefore, we inspected fishery survival \nprobability as a function of somatic growth rate in pike larger than 54 cm body-length, i.e., \npike already recruited into the fishery (see Materials and Methods). Once recruited into the \nfishery, faster growers had increased survival probability (figure 1b; n = 15,972; p < 0.001), \nconfirming that the fishery was disruptive not only on pike body size, but also on pike somatic \ngrowth rate. After the early 1960s, sampled pike had a decreased variance in somatic growth \n(figure 1d, top panel), in accordance with the prediction that stabilizing natural selection on \nbody size selected against both slow and fast growers. \nRaw trends in somatic growth rate were transmitted into corresponding trends in \nlength-at-age. Variance in length-at-age-3 and age-4 (the two age-classes most strongly \naffected by the fishery, see Table 1) increased at the start of the time series and decreased at \nits end (figure 1c, down panel). However, the intensity of disruptive fishery selection was not \nstrong enough to generate bimodality in length-at-age distributions (figure 3), probably due to \nweak fishing mortality (see introduction). Temporal fluctuations in somatic growth rate and \nlength-at-age-3 and age-4 were statistically significant when tested with generalized additive \nmodels in which natural log-transformed variance was the response and a smoothed Year \nclass term was the predictor (somatic growth rate: n=49; p < 0.001; length-at-age-3 and age-4: \nn=98; p < 0.001). Taken together, raw trends are remarkably consistent with the prediction \nthat disruptive fishery selection opposed the effects of stabilizing natural selection in \nincreasing pike phenotypic variance. As a second step of our analysis, we applied analytical \nmethods aiming at testing for a possible sampling bias and at removing environmental noise \ninto raw trends.\nPage 14 of 26\nModeled trends in pike phenotypic variance\nThe reconstructed unbiased trend in somatic growth variance (figure 1d) is in close agreement \nwith the trend observed in raw data (i.e., variance increased up to the early 1960s and \ndecreased afterwards), indicating that patterns observed in the raw data reflect true patterns \nthat occurred in the population. After having validated that our data were not biased, we \naccounted for environmental noise into pike phenotypic variance using statistical models in \nwhich we explicitly modeled temporal changes in residual variance (see Materials and \nMethods). Results are shown in Table 3 (statistical significance is considered when both \nconfidence limits have the same sign). Residual variance significantly decreased for all \nanalyzed traits from Period 1 of dominating fishery selection (year classes from 1944 to \n1963) to Period 2 of dominating natural selection (year classes from 1964 to 1993). \nMoreover, across Period 1, residual variance increased in all traits, although statistical \nsignificance was not reached for somatic growth rate, length-at-age-1 and length-at-age-6 \n(Table 3). Residual variance in length-at-age-1 and length-at-age-2 increased despite the fact \nthat age-1 pike were not caught by the fishery and that nonlinear fishery selection was not \nstatistically significant on age-2 pike (Table 1), a result reflecting disruptive fishery selection \non lifetime somatic growth rate. Interestingly, residual variance in length-at-age-3 to age-6 \npike increased in parallel with the amplitude of nonlinear fishery selection gradients acting on \nthese age-classes (Table 1), further supporting the view that the fishery was the primary driver \nof increased pike phenotypic variance across Period 1. Across Period 2 of dominating natural \nselection, natural selection became increasingly stabilizing and fishery selection tended to be \nless disruptive (figure 1a). In parallel, variance in body length decreased significantly in all \nanalyzed traits except length-at-age-2 (Table 3). Lack of change in variance for length-at-age-\n2 might be linked to exceptionally weak stabilizing natural selection combined with relaxation \nPage 15 of 26\nof strongly directional fishery selection on this age class (Table 1). To sum up, our results \nsupport the view that pike phenotypic variance tracked the curvature of the adaptive \nlandscape, which was imposed by the dominating selective force.\nDiscussion\nOur results empirically demonstrate that the common a priori assumption that harvesting \ncauses size truncation and decreased trait variability may be wrong. In Windermere, gillnet \nfishing instead caused disruptive selection and increased trait variability. Therefore, careful \nconsideration of the exact form of selection should precede inference about the mechanisms \nthrough which populations are negatively affected by harvesting. Our field-based findings are \nconsistent with laboratory-based experiments in fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster and mice \nMus musculus demonstrating that disruptive selection increases genetic variability and \ncapacity to respond to selection (Roff1997). Accordingly, in Windermere pike a fishery-\ndriven increase in capacity to respond to selection might have favoured the observed rapid \nevolutionary rebound after relaxation of the fishing pressure (Edeline2007#1611)\n(Conover2007)(Coltman2008). Interestingly, stabilizing natural selection decreased \nWindermere pike trait variance as observed in other systems (Roff1997)(Haugen2008), and \ndisruptive fishery selection might thus have paradoxically increased pike capacity to respond \nto selection compared to a pristine pike population. \nIn contrast to Windermere pike, several fish stocks have been found to be unable to \nrebound after relaxation of fishing (Berkeley2004)(Hutchings2008)(Hutchings2000)\n(Sinclair2002#1148). For instance, cod in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence collapsed in the \nearly 1990s and has still failed to recover since the fishery was closed in 1993 \n(Sinclair2002#1148). To our knowledge, the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence cod is the only \nPage 16 of 26\npopulation beside Windermere pike for which the exact form of fishery selection has been \ninvestigated. Fishery selection acting on cod body size changed from disruptive in the 1970s \nto truncation selection in the 1980s and early 1990s (i.e., before and during stock collapse), \nindicating that disruptive fishing can also occur at commercial exploitation rates. The change \nin the form of fishery selection was due to a parallel increase in both the fishing effort (that \nreduced survival in medium-sized cod) and in the minimum mesh-size of fishing gears (that \nreduced survival in large cod) (Sinclair2002#1148). Increasing minimum size limits is \ngenerally intended as a conservative measure allowing intensification of exploitation rates, \nbut it might instead favor erosion of genetic variance for somatic growth and correlated traits, \npromote population collapse, and impair recovery. In contrast, maintaining disruptive \nharvesting necessitates combining slot size regulations (to preserve large individuals) with \nmoderate exploitation rates (so that enough medium-sized individuals survive to a large size). \nTherefore, managed disruptive harvesting might represent a comprehensive and efficient tool \nfor sustainable exploitation of living resources.\nAcknowledgments.
