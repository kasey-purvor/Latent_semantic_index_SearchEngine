Introduction\n[2] Over the instrumental period the area west of the\nAntarctic Peninsula (Figure 1) has experienced considerable\nclimatic changes. Data from Faraday\/Vernadsky record a\nsignificant annual mean air temperature increase of 0.56\u00b0C\nper decade from 1951 to 2000, focused on winter with June\u2013\nAugust temperatures rising by 1.09\u00b0C per decade [King,\n1994; Turner et al., 2005]. A smaller summer warming\nis implicated in the disintegration of floating ice shelves\n[Vaughan and Doake, 1996] and the acceleration and calving\nfront retreat of nearby ice streams [Cook et al., 2005;\nPritchard and Vaughan, 2007].\n[3] Bellingshausen Sea (BS) sea ice conditions, which\ncorrelate well with air temperatures on the peninsula [King,\n1994; Jacobs and Comiso, 1997], have changed consider-\nably in conjunction with this atmospheric warming. Uniquely\nin Antarctica, mean sea ice extent and concentration have\ndecreased (primarily in summer) [Stammerjohn and Smith,\n1997; Smith and Stammerjohn, 2001; Liu et al., 2004], and\nthe ice season duration has decreased markedly [Parkinson,\n2002; Stammerjohn et al., 2008]. The upper 100 m of the\nocean has also warmed, at a rate of up to 0.5\u00b0C per decade\nin summer between 1955 and 1998, with the warming signal\nstrongly surface intensified and accompanied by increasing\nsalinity [Meredith and King, 2005].\n[4] Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain\nthese changes [Vaughan et al., 2003]. For example, Jacobs\nand Comiso [1997] discussed the possibility that warming\nor increased upwelling of the Circumpolar Deep Water\n(CDW) present at depth in the BS could lead to a decrease in\nsea\u2010ice extent and hence atmospheric warming. However,\nMeredith and King [2005] argue that the observed surface\nenhancement of the ocean warming signal is not explained by\nthis process. Many authors suggest that changes in atmo-\nspheric circulation could lead to regional atmospheric\nwarming and sea ice retreat (by mechanical drag or thermo-\ndynamic processes) [e.g., Turner et al., 1997; Marshall and\nKing, 1998; Thompson and Solomon, 2002; Harangozo,\n2006]. However, atmospheric circulation changes explain-\ning Antarctic Peninsula warming have not yet been detected\ndirectly. It is also possible that air\u2010sea ice feedback has\namplified these or other changes. This is supported by the\nwinter focus of the observed warming; a midtropospheric\nwarming similar to the summer signal is observed across\nAntarctica [Turner et al., 2006], so a wintertime surface\namplification of this signal could wholly explain the local\nwarming.\n[5] Oceanographically the BS appears similar to the\nAmundsen Sea (AS) further west and markedly different\nfrom other embayed shelf seas around Antarctica. The entire\ncontinental shelf is flooded by CDW (temperature \u22651.0\u00b0C,\nsalinity 34.7) overlain by its mixtures with Winter Water\n(\u22121.5\u00b0C, 33.8\u201334.0) andAntarctic SurfaceWater (\u22121.8\u20131.0\u00b0C,\n33.0\u201333.7) [Talbot, 1988; Smith et al., 1999; Jenkins and\n1British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\n2Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University,\nNew York, New York, USA.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/10\/2008JC005219\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 115, C05020, doi:10.1029\/2008JC005219, 2010\nC05020 1 of 16\nJacobs, 2008]. The latter water masses are formed by inter-\naction with the atmosphere, but the CDW originates in the\nAntarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) offshore of the shelf\nbreak, where it is associated with a temperature maximum of\n1.6\u20132.0\u00b0C underlain by cooler waters at a salinity maximum of\n34.74. In the deep BS the temperature maximum occurs at the\ndepth of the shelf break, so water from below often intrudes\nonto the shelf, giving it a discernible middepth temperature\nmaximum [Smith et al., 1999;Klinck et al., 2004; Jenkins and\nJacobs, 2008; D. R. Shoosmith, personal communication,\n2008]. Intrusions of CDW onto the shelf are episodic but\npersistent [Hofmann and Klinck, 1998; Klinck et al., 2004;\nMoffat et al., 2009], can involve significant uplift of dense\nwaters [Klinck et al., 2004], and entail a \u22480.5\u00b0C cooling\n[Jenkins and Jacobs, 2008], indicating a relatively vigorous\ntransport process.\n[6] The north\u2010eastern sector of the BS (offshore of Faraday\/\nVernadsky and in Marguerite Bay; see Figure 1) has been\nrelatively well observed owing to the presence of research\nbases nearby [Martinson et al., 2008]. The ACC flows north\u2010\neast along the shelf break and CDW pulses, centered on\nbathymetric depressions, periodically flood onto the shelf\n[Hofmann and Klinck, 1998; Dinniman and Klinck, 2004;\nKlinck et al., 2004; Moffat et al., 2009; Savidge and Amft,\n2009]. Geological evidence and near\u2010bottom current mea-\nsurements show that this flow is underlain by an opposing\nsouth\u2010westward current tracking the continental slope\n[Tucholke, 1977;Hillenbrand et al., 2008]. Thus the evidence\npoints to vertical shear offshore of the shelf break. The cir-\nculation on shelf consists of a south\u2010westward summertime\ncoastal current [Moffat et al., 2008] that further north may be\ndivided into subgyres by topography [Hofmann et al., 1996;\nSavidge and Amft, 2009].\n[7] In contrast to this detailed picture, very little has been\npublished on the area further west, north of Eltanin Bay and\nRonne Entrance, which we hereafter refer to as the \u2018central\nBS\u2019. Talbot [1988] and Jenkins and Jacobs [2008] report\noceanographic sections from the deep ocean into Ronne\nEntrance, finding CDW flooding the shelf in a similar manner\nto further east. Seal tag observations reported by Hofmann et\nal. [2009] show that the temperature maximum is slightly\ncooler in the central BS than in Marguerite Bay. A variety of\nobservations show that sea ice moves in a cyclonic fashion\naround this area of the shelf [King, 2003; Assmann et al.,\n2005; Heil et al., 2006], which suggests that the coastal\ncurrent continues all the way into the AS and Ross Sea. Orsi\net al. [1995] suggest that a current associated with the\nsouthern ACC front follows the shelf break east from 100\u00b0W,\nleading to the presence of core CDW offshore of the shelf\nbreak throughout the region.\n[8] Many ice shelves fringe the BS (Figure 1), but the\nmost intensively studied by far is George VI Ice Shelf\n(GVIIS). GVIIS occupies George VI Sound, a large rift that\nconnects the deep continental shelf regions in Marguerite\nFigure 1. Model bathymetry and ice shelf thickness and location of domain (inset).

In the early 1980s the\nwater column beneath GVIIS was sampled through rifts,\nrevealing that CDW with temperatures of up to 1.0\u00b0C\nunderlies the entire ice shelf [Potter and Paren, 1985]. At\nthe northern end of the cavity, a CDW inflow was found to\nupwell and melt the ice shelf before departing in a strong\nsurface outflow constrained to the west by Coriolis force\n[Potter et al., 1988]. Jenkins and Jacobs [2008] sampled\nboth ice fronts synoptically in 1994, finding this flow pat-\ntern at both locations and deducing a net south\u2010to\u2010north\nthroughflow at the time of measurement.\n[9] GVIIS basal melt rates have been determined using\na variety of methods. From glaciological considerations\nBishop and Walton [1981] determined steady state melt\nrates varying spatially between 1 and 8 m a\u22121, while Potter\net al. [1984] calculated an equilibrium rate of 2.1 m a\u22121 for\nthe whole ice shelf. Corr et al. [2002] obtained a direct point\nmeasurement of 2.8 m a\u22121 total melting in December 2000\nin a thick southern part of the ice shelf. Jenkins and Jacobs\n[2008] constrain the total melt rate to be between 2.3 and\n4.9 m a\u22121 in March 1994, implying that on that date the ice\nshelf was melting above the Potter et al. [1984] equilibrium\nand losing mass. A study by L. Padman et al. (personal\ncommunication, 2009) suggests that Wilkins Ice Shelf must\nhave melted at 1.5\u20132 m a\u22121 to explain their observations of\n\u22481 m a\u22121 thinning between 1992 and 2003. With the\nexception of Bach Ice Shelf, where Woodruff and Doake\n[1979] report a steady state melt rate of 0.65 m a\u22121, we\nare unaware of published melt rates for other ice shelves in\nthe area.\n[10] The aim of this paper is to use a three\u2010dimensional\nocean model to extend and explain the spatially and tem-\nporally sparse observations of the BS. We suggest features\nof the circulation in the poorly observed central BS and\nnearby shelf break and examine annual and interannual var-\niation in ocean behavior. We examine variation in the GVIIS\nmelt rate and consider its oceanic drivers.\n2. Model Description\n[11] In this study atmospheric reanalysis data are used to\nforce an isopycnic coordinate ocean model coupled to a\ndynamic\u2010thermodynamic sea ice model and thermodynam-\nically active ice shelves. The domain (Figure 1) extends\nfrom 110\u00b0W to 50\u00b0W and from 75\u00b030\u2032S to 60\u00b0S and all\nmodel components use an isotropic grid with a resolution of\n0.4\u00b0 longitude (11 km at the southern boundary, 22 km at\nthe northern boundary). This grid is the finest that can be\nsolved within a reasonable time; the solution is computa-\ntionally intensive because a relatively large domain is required\nand investigating interannual variability demands a long sim-\nulation (the model generates results for the years 1979\u20132007\ninclusive).\n2.1. Ocean\u2010Ice Shelf Model\n[12] We use a version of the Miami Isopycnic Coordinate\nOcean Model [Bleck et al., 1992] that has been adapted for\nuse beneath ice shelves [Holland and Jenkins, 2001]. The\nocean is comprised of 13 isopycnic layers and a surface\nmixed layer that has a freely evolving density. The mixed\nlayer handles interaction with the overlying atmosphere or ice\nand communicates with interior layers via an entrainment\/\ndetrainment routine. To accurately resolve the water mass\nstructure at the continental shelf break, where rapidly varying\ndensities overlie weakly stratified deep water [Talbot, 1988],\nthe isopycnic layers are distributed evenly over a density\nprofile comprised of two linear progressions between\n1027.3 kg m\u22123 (layer 2), 1027.75 kg m\u22123 (layer 8), and\n1027.875 kg m\u22123 (layer 14).\n[13] Initial layer temperatures, salinities, and thicknesses\nare derived from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI)\nHydrographic Atlas of the Southern Ocean [Olbers et al.,\n1992]. On the continental shelf (defined here as all areas\nsouth of the 600 m depth contour at the continental shelf\nbreak), layer 7 is initially expanded downwards, deflating all\ndenser layers, to ensure that subsequent shelf waters are\nformed by ocean processes rather than being interpolated\nfrom the atlas. The chief weakness of our modeling effort\n(and focus for future development) is that all model bound-\naries are implemented as closed nonslip walls; the impact of\nthis should be borne in mind when considering model results.\nDespite this limitation a reasonable, though steady, ACC is\ngenerated offshore of the continental shelf (see section 3.3) by\nrestoring ocean properties to the constant AWI atlas condi-\ntions over a 3 grid cell region around the western, northern,\nand eastern boundaries (Figure 1). Baroclinic restoring\ntimescales vary linearly between 10 days at the outermost\ncells and 30 days at the innermost cells of the restoring region.\nNo barotropic restoring is used.\n[14] The bathymetric grid used in the model was formed\nby blending the BEDMAP bed elevation grid [Lythe et al.,\n2001] with data compiled at the British Antarctic Survey\nfrom a variety of cruises. Ice shelf drafts are derived from\nthe BEDMAP ice thickness. No smoothing is used on either\nthe bedrock or ice shelf bases.\n2.2. Sea\u2010Ice Model\n[15] Sea ice is modeled using version 3.14 of CICE, the\nLos Alamos sea ice model [Hunke and Lipscomb, 2006].\nCICE features the elastic\u2010viscous\u2010plastic ice dynamics of\nHunke and Dukowicz [1997], the energy\u2010based ridging\nscheme of Thorndike et al. [1975], an ice strength parame-\nterization given by Rothrock [1975], and horizontal advec-\ntion via an incremental remapping scheme [Lipscomb and\nHunke, 2004].\n[16] The present application divides the ice into five\nthickness categories with lower boundaries of 0.0, 0.64,\n1.39, 2.47, and 4.57 m. The energy\u2010conserving thermody-\nnamics model of Bitz and Lipscomb [1999] is used, with\neach thickness category using five thermodynamic layers of\nwhich the uppermost is snow. Whenever the ocean becomes\nsupercooled, additional ice is added to the smallest size class\nat at rate that would quench the supercooling over a 24 hour\ntimescale. The model starts from an ice\u2010free state and no\nrestoring of ice fields is applied at the edges of the domain,\nwhich are treated as nonslip solid boundaries for consistency\nwith the ocean model.\n[17] CICE contains a stability\u2010based parameterization for\nthe turbulent exchange of momentum and heat between\natmosphere and sea ice. We replaced this with a quadratic\nlaw using a drag coefficient of 10\u22123 (a central value in the\nrange used by other authors [Miller et al., 2006]) in order to\nsuppress spurious polynya formation, as described in the\nnext section. Testing showed that the replacement reduced\nHOLLAND ET AL.: PROCESSES IN THE BELLINGSHAUSEN SEA C05020C05020\n3 of 16\nthe wind drag on the sea ice by a factor of approximately 2.5\n(compared to the CICE formulation with \u2018standard\u2019 rough-\nness length of 0.5 mm). Ice\u2010water drag used a quadratic law\nwith coefficient 6 \u00d7 10\u22123.\n[18] At various stages in this paper we refer to quantities\nderived from satellite observations of sea ice concentration.\nWe used monthly data derived using the NASA Team\nalgorithm [Cavalieri et al., 2006] from the SMMR and SSM\/I\nsensors over the period 1979\u20132007, which are henceforth\nreferred to as \u2018SSMI data\u2019. Where sea ice extent is discussed,\nthis is the total area with ice concentration of at least 15%. See\nStammerjohn and Smith [1996] for a full discussion of the\nissues involved. SSMI\u2010derived sea ice motion vectors\n[Fowler, 2003] are also plotted for comparison with model\nresults.\n2.3. Atmospheric Forcing\n[19] The model is forced with daily mean sea level pres-\nsure and 2 m air temperature from the National Centers for\nEnvironmental Prediction and National Center for Atmo-\nspheric Research (hereafter NCEP) reanalysis data [Kalnay\net al., 1996], interpolated to the 1 hour \u2018coupling\u2019 time\nstep used to pass information between different model\ncomponents. European Centre for Medium\u2010Range Weather\nForecasts reanalysis data are generally considered better in\nAntarctica [Marshall, 2003], but the NCEP reanalyses are\nreasonable over the satellite era [Marshall and Harangozo,\n2000] and are the only consistent product available for the\nwhole period of interest here. The model is run using NCEP\ndata from 1969 onwards, but the years before 1979 are\nconsidered a spin\u2010up period because NCEP data are sig-\nnificantly less reliable prior to the onset of satellite sounder\ndata assimilation in late 1978.\n[20] Sea level pressures are probably the best constrained\nof the reanalyses data, so these are used to calculate a geo-\nstrophic wind that is converted to a 10 m wind by applying a\nmagnitude ratio of 0.6 and turning angle of 12\u00b0 [Thorndike\nand Colony, 1982; Timmermann et al., 1999]. The wind\nstrength is ramped up over the model spin\u2010up period to allow\nthe deep layers on shelf to adjust from their initially deflated\nstate. Shortwave radiation is calculated according to the for-\nmulation adopted by Parkinson and Washington [1979] and\ndownwelling longwave radiation comes from the formula of\nRosati and Miyakoda [1988]. Whenever cloud fraction is\nrequired by these formulae the climate atlas of Oberhuber\n[1988] is used. Precipitation is derived from the global cli-\nmatology of Legates and Willmott [1990], converted to rain\nor snow depending upon the 2 m air temperature. Specific\nhumidity is fixed to the saturation humidity determined by the\nformula of Hunke and Holland [2007].\n[21] Early model testing revealed that the NCEP winds\ngenerated persistent wintertime polynyas in Eltanin Bay in a\nfew specific years, leading to a prevalence of cold shelf\nwaters in the central BS. Winter polynyas do occur in this\narea [Tamura et al., 2008], but they are highly transient\n(J. C. King, personal communication, 2008) and generally\ndo not persist for long enough to appear in the monthly\nSSMI data. The presence of cold waters at depth on shelf\nin summer directly contradicts observations, so the model\npolynyas are regarded as spurious. The persistent offshore\nwinds responsible for these polynyas are questionable\nbecause the NCEP reanalysis (resolution \u2248200 km) very\ncoarsely represents the coastline and orography in the\nregion. Excessive polynyas may partly be a feature of the\nsea ice model, since the lack of tensile strength in standard\nsea\u2010ice rheologies makes the ice overly susceptible to shore\nlead polynyas [K\u00f6nig Beatty and Holland, 2010]. The\nmagnitude of the problem was exacerbated by the coarse-\nness of sea ice grids used in early testing. We found that\nreplacing the air\u2010ice drag formulation as described in the\nprevious section limited the effect of the spurious winds and\nreduced the formation of these polynyas to more realistic\nlevels. This change is uncontroversial [e.g., Miller et al.,\n2006], reduces the wind drag towards the level used in\nrelated studies [Thoma et al., 2008], and produces sea\u2010ice\nvelocities that agree well with observations [Heil et al.,\n2006]. We return to the topic of Eltanin Bay polynyas\nbelow.\n3. Results\n[22] The results of each model component are presented\nseparately in terms of a \u2018snapshot\u2019 state and temporal vari-\nability. Since the observations of Jenkins and Jacobs [2008]\nwere made in March 1994, this date is taken as the reference\nfor all snapshots. The discussion proceeds down the\nmodel hierarchy from atmospheric forcing to ice shelf\nconsequences.\n3.1. Atmosphere\n[23] Sea level pressures around Antarctica are dominated\nby the circumpolar trough, which moves south and deepens\nbiannually in equinoctial seasons (particularly in spring) in a\npattern known as the Semi\u2010Annual Oscillation [e.g., van\nLoon, 1967]. In the South Pacific, the climatological low\nthat is the local manifestation of this trough also undergoes a\nlarger annual longitudinal movement between its winter\nlocation over the Ross Sea and its summer location over the\nBS [e.g., Bromwich and Wang, 2008]. Figures 2a\u20132d show\nthat seasonal means of the 1979\u20132007 NCEP reanalysis sea\nlevel pressure used to force the model broadly bear out these\npatterns; the depression is centered on the BS in summer and\noff to the west in winter, with a deepening and southward\nrelocation in spring. In addition, the NCEP reanalysis fea-\ntures a small trough centered on the BS in most seasons,\nmost noticeably in winter.\n[24] Figures 2e and 2f show climatologies of the varying\nair temperature and precipitation used to force the model.\nNCEP temperatures agree with data reported by Vaughan\nand Doake [1996] and precipitation from the data set of\nLegates and Willmott [1990] peaks on the northern penin-\nsula in agreement with the observations and model results\nshown by van Lipzig et al. [2004]. The band of higher\nprecipitation following the rest of the BS coastline predicted\nby the model of van Lipzig et al. [2004] is not present in\nour forcing, but precipitation rates over the central BS are\nreasonable.\n3.2. Sea Ice\n[25] BS sea ice varies between small areas of multiyear ice\nin summer to winter expanses of first year ice extending to\n60\u00b0S. Figure 3 shows SSMI and model sea ice concentra-\ntions and ice motion vectors for March and September 1994,\nHOLLAND ET AL.: PROCESSES IN THE BELLINGSHAUSEN SEA C05020C05020\n4 of 16\na year of representative model skill. The agreement is gen-\nerally good but with a few systematic problems.\n[26] In summer, observations show that sea ice retreats to\na position offshore of Abbott Ice Shelf (Figure 3), flowing\nwestward along the coast [King, 2003]. Themodel reproduces\nthis situation but loses its ice cover a little too rapidly, so that\nby March no ice remains to bound the polynyas in Ronne\nEntrance. Candidate explanations for this rapid retreat include\nexcessive north\u2010easterly winds advecting ice out of the region\nand overzealous melting by the atmosphere and\/or ocean.\nThere are few data against which to investigate the veracity\nof each mechanism, but March 2001 sea ice speeds of\n\u224830 cm s\u22121 off Venable Ice Shelf almost exactly match the\nbuoy observations of King [2003]. An investigation of the\nfull SSMI data set reveals that in spring ice generally retreats\nfastest in the central BS, with the southward\u2010retreating ice\nedge meeting northward\u2010growing Ronne Entrance polynyas\nin a band of low ice concentration. The model loses ice rap-\nidly from a band in the correct area but does not properly\nreproduce the spring polynyas.\n[27] The SSMI\u2010derived ice motion vectors plotted in\nFigure 3 are untested in the BS and are likely to be\nuntrustworthy in summer [Emery et al., 1997]. Ice redirected\nnorthwards by our solid western boundary is melted by the\natmospheric and boundary forcing (Figure 3) and very rarely\nenters the area of the time series discussed later. It also has\nlittle effect on ice dynamics in the center of the domain,\nwhich are basically wind driven throughout the year.\n[28] The SSMI data show that in winter the central BS\nfills with high ice concentrations surrounded by sparser\nareas at the ice edge and coastline (Figure 3). As far as\nmotion vectors can be trusted, ice drifts to the northeast,\nfollowing the prevailing winds. Figure 3 shows that the\nmodel reasonably captures the overall ice extent and motion,\nbut apparently has an excessive northward transport of ice in\nthe central BS due to brisk south\u2010easterly NCEP winds\ncentered on Eltanin Bay. The persistent winter 1994 Eltanin\nBay polynya is reproduced by the model (as far as it is\nresolved by SSMI data) despite this apparently erroneous ice\nmotion. This polynya appears to represent a contradiction\nFigure 2. Atmospheric forcing averaged over the period 1979\u20132007.

The latter\nproblem is probably due to a coarse land mask and lack of\nkatabatics in the wind forcing. The results of Comiso et al.\n[1997] indicate that observations processed using the Boot-\nstrap algorithm would have higher ice concentrations in the\ncentral pack, in better agreement with the model, but would\nretain the diffuse ice edge. Our overly sharp edge might\nresult from excessive northward ice transport but may also\nbe attributable to a \u22484\u00b0C cold bias in the NCEP forcing\n[Bromwich and Fogt, 2004]. (The correlation between\nNCEP temperatures and observations is high despite the\nbias (R. L. Fogt, personal communication, 2008).)\n[30] Figure 4 shows a range of comparisons between\nSSMI and modeled ice extents designed to assess our ability\nto reproduce interannual sea ice variations. Inspection of the\nSSMI time series for the whole BS in Figure 4a shows the\n1980s decline in summer sea ice extent noted by Jacobs and\nComiso [1997] and others. It is also apparent that winter sea\nice in the BS experiences significant interannual variation,\nexpanding or contracting as the prevailing westerlies over the\nice edge are moderated by meridional winds to a varying\ndegree [Harangozo, 2006; Heil et al., 2006]. Both the sum-\nmer decline and winter variability seem to have stabilized\nsomewhat since the mid\u20101990s.\n[31] The model generally succeeds in reproducing inter-\nannual variability in the BS winter ice extent but never retains\nlarge areas of ice in summer (Figure 4a) in consequence of the\nrapid spring retreat described above. The winter maximum of\nthe mean annual cycle is of a reasonable magnitude, though\nlagged behind the observations (Figure 4b). The summer\nminimum of the mean model cycle precedes that of the data,\nconfirming that its underprediction arises from an excessive\nspring sea\u2010ice retreat.\n[32] These time series indicate that, given the quality of\nour forcing, the model is fairly representing large\u2010scale sea\nice processes integrated over thewhole BS.Most importantly,\nthe mean annual cycle of ice extent is reasonable and the\nmodel also captures observed interannual variations in the\nwinter maximum (Figure 4c). It is unsurprising that ice\nextents are reasonable because the SST\/sea ice field that\nforms the NCEP lower boundary condition is partly derived\nfrom SSMI data [Kalnay et al., 1996]. The good correlation of\nwinter ice extent maxima with observations gives us some\nFigure 3.

Velocities are shown every\nsecond grid point in all cases. The boxes in Figure 3b show the areas over which time series of ice extent\nare produced in Figure 4.

These time series are\nexpressed as fractions of possible ice\u2010covered area because\nthe different coastlines in the SSMI data and the model\npreclude a direct comparison of ice areas (this difference is\nnegligible when the whole BS is considered). The time series\nshow a reasonable agreement, particularly in Marguerite\nBay, where the interannual variability in ice cover seems to\nbe captured well by the model. The agreement in Ronne\nEntrance is less convincing, with the model predicting several\nretreats in years when the bay stayed ice\u2010covered all summer.\nCloser investigation reveals this to be another result of the\nrapid central BS ice retreats described above.\n3.3. Ocean\n[34] Perhaps surprisingly, predicted ocean circulation\npatterns throughout most of the domain agree well with the\navailable evidence despite our impermeable boundaries. A\n1979\u20132007 average of currents at 200 m depth (Figure 5a)\nshows the ACC flowing eastward through the domain with a\nsouthern core that joins the shelf break (slightly too far east\naccording to Orsi et al. [1995]) and follows it eastward in\nagreement with observation [Dinniman and Klinck, 2004;\nSavidge and Amft, 2009]. The model also suggests that a\nweak cyclonic gyre persists on the continental shelf. The\ndeep ocean (below approximately 700 m) contains a south\u2010\nwestward flow that hugs contours in the continental slope\n(Figure 5b) in agreement with current meter observations\n[Tucholke, 1977; Hillenbrand et al., 2008]. The model\ntherefore contains vertical shear immediately offshore of the\nshelf break. The deep southwestward flow is probably over-\npredicted because our closed boundaries force a recirculation\nin the domain, so the layers above this are the primary focus of\nthis study. Wherever the flow field is corrupted by closed\nboundaries, restoring to atlas properties ensures that no spu-\nrious water masses are formed. In particular, the recirculation\non the western edge of the domain occurs over longer time-\nscales than that of the boundary restoring, ensuring that there\nis no recycling of shelf water properties into the eastward\u2010\nflowing ACC.\n[35] Both flow patterns mentioned above persist through-\nout the simulation, but surface currents experience a consid-\nerable annual fluctuation due to variable wind forcing and sea\nFigure 4.

Throughout the year a strong eastward current is\npresent north of 65\u00b0S (Figures 5c and 5d), but in autumn and\nsummer a narrow coastal current flows south\u2010westward along\nthe shelf and emerges as a strong westward flow to the north\nof Venable and Abbott ice shelves (Figure 5c). The model\nthus suggests that the summertime Antarctic Peninsula\nCoastal Current ofMoffat et al. [2008] extends into the central\nBS and increases in magnitude. The recirculation thereafter\nis probably a consequence of our solid western boundary;\nobservation [Assmann et al., 2005] and the atmospheric\nforcing (Figure 2) suggest that the coastal current should\ncontinue into the AS.\n[36] Moffat et al. [2008] argue that the coastal current\nis buoyancy driven by freshwater sources. Our modeled\ncoastal current is primarily wind driven because our pre-\ncipitation climatology contains no relevant feature west of\nMarguerite Bay (Figure 2f) and freshwater runoff from land\nis neglected (though there is a minor contribution from ice\nshelf meltwater). Our coastal current disappears from the\nnorth\u2010eastern BS and weakens in the central BS in winter\nand spring (Figure 5d) because the winds contain a smaller\nalongshore component in these seasons than in summer and\nautumn (Figure 2). The shear strength of the winter sea ice\ncover also increases the horizontal length over which wind\nstress is transmitted to the ocean, smoothing the surface flow\nfield.\n[37] Overall model results are reasonable when compared\nto the March 1994 observations of Jenkins and Jacobs\n[2008] (Figure 6). Salinity sections show that dense waters\nare bought on shelf by the model circulation, though the\nvery densest waters with salinities greater than 34.7 are\nabsent in the central BS because the ACC joins the shelf\nbreak a little too far east, partly bypassing Belgica Trough.\nIn Marguerite Bay (Figure 6b) the over prevalence of dense\nwaters and the middepth temperature maximum do not\nexactly match the Jenkins and Jacobs [2008] observations\nbut agree with the 2001 data of Klinck et al. [2004], indi-\ncating that the model behavior is plausible. In both the\nBelgica and Marguerite sections the simulated warm surface\nlayer is too far advanced towards the coast because of the\naccelerated springtime ice retreat discussed previously.\n[38] In the Belgica Trough section (Figure 6a) the model\ndoes not properly raise waters from beneath the temperature\nmaximum onto the shelf. The model also fails to represent a\ndiapycnal mixing at the shelf break that in the observations\npinches out the highest temperatures as water floods onto\nthe shelf. Both features might in reality be related to the\nvelocity shear at the shelf break. Water of the correct tem-\nperature gets onto the shelf but then appears to cool by \u22480.5\u00b0C\nrelative to the observations. This cooler water is a remnant\nof anomalous sea ice years in the late 1980s, so we now\ndescribe the ocean\u2019s simulated interannual variability.\n[39] We have shown that the model presents a reasonable\nocean state and a fair expression of the surface forcing\nvariability. Figure 7 shows that the consequent ocean vari-\nability in Ronne Entrance and Marguerite Bay, expressed as\nvariation in isopycnic layer thicknesses, is relatively small.\nThere are few data in Ronne Entrance with which to compare\nthis conclusion, but several long\u2010term monitoring projects\nhave been carried out in and around Marguerite Bay.

[2004] note little variation beneath this depth\nother than rapid periodic intrusions of CDW.Martinson et al.\n[2008] and Clarke et al. [2008] show that interannual vari-\nability is generally low, and basically nonexistent below\n200 m. The mixed layer depths and the general lack of deep\nocean variability in these studies agree with Figure 7b.\n[40] Figure 7 contains considerable differences to the AS\nresults of Thoma et al. [2008], despite the apparent simi-\nlarity between the oceanography of that area and the BS and\nour use of the same ocean model, atmospheric forcing, and\nfixed boundary conditions. The BS results show markedly\nsmaller mixed layer thicknesses and a reduced annual cycle\nin the thickness of deeper layers. There are too few data to\nknow whether these differences are present in reality. The\nFigure 6.

Note that the observations of Jenkins and Jacobs\n[2008] follow the ship track (x axis is along\u2010track distance) while the model sections are taken along\n77\u00b030\u2032W and 70\u00b0W (x axis is latitude).\nHOLLAND ET AL.: PROCESSES IN THE BELLINGSHAUSEN SEA C05020C05020\n9 of 16\nthinner mixed layers may be real but could be attributable to\nthe improved representation of sea ice in this model; the\nsimple ice in the Thoma et al. [2008] study lacks shear\nstrength and therefore permits more polynyas and deep\nconvection on shelf.\n[41] There are good reasons to expect that the reduced\nannual cycle in the deep layers might be a real difference\nbetween the regions. The BS is positioned further from the\ncenter of the climatological low pressure\u2019s annual longitu-\ndinal relocation (Figure 2) so it experiences less variation in\nits local atmospheric forcing. The relocation causes winds\nover the AS shelf break to swing from easterly in summer\nand autumn to westerly in winter and spring. Thoma et al.\n[2008] suggest that this directly causes a springtime puls-\ning of CDW on shelf, with interannually\u2010enhanced westerly\nflow leading to a greater CDW flux. The climatological low\nis always west of the BS (Figure 2), so the angle between\nshelf break and isobars fluctuates over a much smaller\nrange. In consequence, less annual pulsing occurs in the\non\u2010shelf transport of CDW and the general circulation is\nless sensitive to interannual variations in the location of the\nclimatological low. Variability driven by the ACC, which\nis precluded in both models by fixed boundary conditions,\ncould also be important.\n[42] A prominent feature of Figure 7a is the period of\nanomalously thick winter mixed layers in the years 1988\u2013\n1991. In these years, record low sea ice extents in the BS\nas a whole were caused by strong winter northerlies\n[Harangozo, 2006], an effect that is exaggerated by the\nNCEP winds and the model (Figure 4a). During these low\nice extent periods the winter ice edge lingers over the con-\ntinental shelf in the central BS rather than proceeding as\nusual to the deep ocean, and the brine rejected by growth at\nthe ice edge then causes anomalously deep convection on\nshelf (down to 400m). Ultimately this convection leads to\nthe thickening of deep layers on shelf (Figure 7a) and the\ncooling noted in Figure 6a. Figure 4e shows that in these\nyears the modeled Ronne Entrance ice extent is not anom-\nalous, confirming that the deep mixed layers and thickened\ndeeper layers are generated over the continental shelf rather\nthan locally.\n3.4. Ice Shelves\n[43] When considering sub\u2010ice\u2010shelf processes we con-\ncentrate on GVIIS because the many smaller ice shelves\nfringing the BS are lacking in observational benchmarks and\nare poorly resolved by the model. Jenkins and Jacobs\n[2008] deduce that in March 1994 the circulation beneath\nGVIIS consisted of distinct southern and northern circula-\ntions, probably divided by a basal ridge in the ice shelf\nat around 70\u00b0W, superimposed upon a net northward\nthroughflow of \u22480.22 Sv. Figure 8a shows a snapshot of the\nsimulated mixed layer velocities from the same date,\nrevealing that the model also features two distinct flow cells\ndivided by the central ridge. At each end of the ice shelf,\nrising meltwater deflects to the left under Coriolis force.\nAt the southern end an additional outflow occurs on the\nnorthern edge of the cavity, of which there is some evidence\nin the Jenkins and Jacobs [2008] data.\n[44] Closer scrutiny of the model velocities reveals that\nthe GVIIS cavity throughflow is incorrect, directed south-\nward with a magnitude of 0.30 Sv. Figure 9 shows that the\nsimulated throughflow fluctuates rapidly around a mean\nflow of only 0.01 Sv northward. That the flow fluctuates so\nwidely is intriguing but impossible to assess without further\ndata. It seems that the detail of the atmospheric forcing at\neither end of GVIIS determines the throughflow at a given\ntime, so it is unsurprising that the model is unable to match\nobservations given the coarseness of the NCEP reanalyses.\nIt is also unsurprising that the model cannot reproduce the\ncavity flow when its topography is so coarsely resolved.\n[45] Figure 8a also shows the pattern of melting beneath\nGVIIS, revealing that high melt rates are tightly focused on\nthe deepest\u2010drafted parts of the ice shelf near glacier inflows\n(Figure 1). Melt rates could be locally too high in the\nsouthern part of the ice shelf, but where the Bishop and\nWalton [1981] data exist the agreement is excellent; a\nlocal maximum melting of \u22488 m a\u22121 beneath the thick ice\nsouth of the Batterbee Mountains decreases to around 1 m a\u22121\nas the ocean flows north to thinner ice. The zonal temperature\nsection in Figure 8b shows why melting increases with ice\ndraft; the deepest ice shelf base is bathed in warm waters that\narrive at the ice shelf relatively unmodified by interaction\nwith the atmosphere. A significant portion of the ice shelf is\nmelted by cooler waters above these core CDW layers, which\nhas important consequences investigated in the next section.\n[46] Table 1 lists the mean and standard deviation of\nsimulated basal melt rates for all ice shelves in the domain.\nThese values should not be treated as reliable and are included\nFigure 7. Time series of layer thicknesses averaged over\nselected areas, labeled with layer numbers.

Some values in Table 1 are reasonable (e.g. Bach Ice\nShelf, where melting exceeds the steady state 0.65 m a\u22121 of\nWoodruff and Doake [1979]) while others are less so (e.g.\nWilkins Ice Shelf, where a rate of 1.5\u20132 m a\u22121 would be more\nappropriate (L. Padman, personal communication, 2009)).\nFor the others there are no data with which to compare. It is\nnotable that Venable Ice Shelf has a high melt rate; this and\nthe lack of an ice shelf in Eltanin Bay are indicative that the\ndeep water in this area is connected with the warm open ocean\nvia Belgica Trough (Figure 1). This is a feature of great\nimportance because satellite altimetry studies show rapid\nthinning of the glaciers feeding into this area [Wingham et al.,\n2006; Pritchard et al., 2009].\n[47] Figure 10a shows the time series of area\u2010averaged\nGVIIS melt rate throughout the simulation, which clearly\nfalls within the range estimated by Jenkins and Jacobs\n[2008] during the period of their measurements. After\n1985 the melt rate exceeds the equilibrium rate of Potter et\nal. [1984], so it could be argued that the overall results\nimply a thinning of GVIIS averaging 0.39 m a\u22121 from 1979\u2013\n2007, or 11.21 m. The glaciological measurements used by\nPotter et al. [1984] were all taken prior to 1976, so their\nequilibrium rate is not strictly applicable to the predicted\nthinning period, but oceanographic and satellite measure-\nments would certainly support ice shelf thinning rates of at\nleast the magnitude shown here [Jenkins and Jacobs, 2008;\nPritchard et al., 2009; A. P. Shepherd, personal communi-\ncation, 2007]. The melt rate contains significant interannual\nvariability, including periods of several years when melting\nis out of balance by over 1 m a\u22121. Factors driving variation\nin the melt rate are examined in the next section.\n[48] Figure 10b shows that modeled net meltwater fluxes\nacross GVIIS northern and southern ice fronts are of similar\nmagnitude, though the southern flux increases through the\nsimulation for reasons explained in the next section. In\ncontrast, the 1994 data of Jenkins and Jacobs [2008] show\nthat a considerably larger net meltwater flux exited the\nnorthern ice front than the southern ice front. This dis-\nagreement between model and observation is consistent with\nthe flow discrepancy reported in Figure 9; Jenkins and\nFigure 8. March 1994 conditions beneath George VI and\nnearby ice shelves.

The data point is the Jenkins\nand Jacobs [2008] estimate of 0.17\u20130.27 Sv net flow from\nsouth to north.\nTable 1.

Jenkins and Jacobs [2008] observed a\nlarge amount of meltwater entering the cavity at the south-\nern ice front, thus decreasing its net outward flux, and if this\nwere all carried by the throughflow it would increase the net\noutward meltwater flux at the northern ice front by an equal\namount. Removing this contribution from both fluxes would\nleave them equal at approximately 45 km3 a\u22121. This value\nagrees with the results of our model, which omits the\nthroughflow at the time in question (Figure 9). This sug-\ngests that our modeled residual melt\u2010driven circulation is\nreasonable.\n4. Discussion\n[49] Figure 11a shows time series of melt rates averaged\nover the areas beneath GVIIS on either side of the 69\u00b0W\nmeridian (as marked in Figure 8). As a result of the relative\nlack of variability in the deep waters in Marguerite Bay\n(Figure 7b), virtually all of the melting variability is driven\nby ocean processes at the southern end of the cavity, i.e.\nin the central BS. Melting in the southern sub\u2010ice\u2010shelf\nregion clearly covaries with the mixed layer temperature in\nthe same area (Figure 11b; correlation 0.91), but explaining\nthe temperature variation is more complex. The tempera-\ntures of other layers in this region (Figure 11c) show a\ngeneral rise during the early 1980s, so the mixed layer\ntemperature (and melt rate) increases as it continually en-\ntrains those layers. The deep warming is a recovery from an\nevent during the model spin\u2010up, rather than purely a spin\u2010\nup artifact; a similar low winter sea ice event to those of\nthe late 1980s (see Figure 4a) occurs in 1975 and the ocean\nsubsequently warms as cool shelf waters formed during\nthis event are replaced by waters transported across the\nshelf break. The link between the cooler shelf waters in\n1994 shown in Figure 6a and the late 1980s events is\nclearly visible in the time series of layer 7 temperature\n(Figure 11c). During these events cool water is injected into\nlayer 7 over the outer shelf and then progressively advected\ninto the areas over which Figures 6a and 11c are plotted.\n[50] After 1985, fluctuations in the melt rate are caused by\na different mechanism. Inspection of the layer temperatures\nin Figure 11c shows no trace that can explain all variations\nof the mixed layer temperature, such as its dip in 1989.\nInstead we must consider the structure of the water column\noffshore of the ice front, as shown in Figure 11d (a modified\nversion of Figure 7a). Figure 11c shows that layer tem-\nperatures on shelf progressively increase with density until\nlayers 8\u201310, which represent relatively unmodified CDW.\nComparing the depths of layer interfaces 6\/7 and 7\/8 (high-\nlighted in Figure 11d) to the mixed layer temperature\n(Figure 11b) an anticorrelation appears; it is clear that the\nmixed layer temperature (and hence the melt rate) increases\nwhenever the deep interfaces shoal. When we also consider\nthe maximum draft of GVIIS (Figure 11d), it becomes\nobvious that the melt rate peaks whenever the warm deep\nlayers thicken to the extent that they contact the ice shelf\nbase.\n[51] This is a notable finding because the modeled vari-\nation in these layer interfaces is driven by large\u2010scale sea ice\nvariability in the BS rather than variations in transport at the\nshelf break. Water masses in layers 1\u201310 are advected across\nthe shelf break, but only layers 1\u20138 interact with the surface\nvia the mixed layer scheme (Figure 11c). Figure 11d shows\nthat the intermediate water column (layers 2\u20138), including\nthe layers controlling melting, fluctuates in phase with the\nmixed layer while the deepest layers representing unmodi-\nfied CDW (9 and 10) do not. This indicates that in our\nmodel the oceanic variability affecting melting is not driven\nby changes in cross\u2010shelf transport but is instead related to\nactivity from above. Even if transport variability at the shelf\nFigure 10. Time series of GVIIS melt rates and meltwater\nfluxes. (a) Mean basal melt rate of GVIIS. The thick line is a\n2 year running mean of the same data series, and the blue\ndashed line is the long\u2010term average melt rate of 2.49 m\na\u22121. The black dashed line represents the equilibrium melt\nrate of 2.1 m a\u22121 estimated by Potter et al. [1984]. The\ndata point is the range of total melt rates consistent with the\nobservations of Jenkins and Jacobs [2008]. A melt rate of\n1 m a\u22121 equates to a meltwater flux of approximately 25 km3\na\u22121 because the ice shelf area is almost exactly 25,000 km2.\n(b) Net meltwater fluxes at the northern and southern ice\nfronts (positive oriented out of the cavity in each case).\nThick lines are 2 year running means, and the data points are\ncalculated from the observations of Jenkins and Jacobs\n[2008]. The disagreement between model and observation\nis caused by the lack of a net south\u2010to\u2010north throughflow in\nthe model (see text).\nHOLLAND ET AL.: PROCESSES IN THE BELLINGSHAUSEN SEA C05020C05020\n12 of 16\nbreak were increased (e.g. by the addition of strong ACC\nvariation in the boundary conditions), the intermediate lay-\ners driving melting would still be strongly impacted by on\u2010\nshelf surface processes.\n[52] The mixed layer thickness in Ronne Entrance features\nan annual cycle that is reflected in the height of the inter-\nfaces between layers 6\u20138 (Figure 11d). This drives an\nannual cycle in the mixed layer temperature under the ice\nshelf (Figure 11b), which translates to an annual cycle in the\nmelt rate (Figure 11a). More importantly, Figure 11 shows\nconsiderable interannual variability adhering to the same\nmechanism. This is apparently driven by whole BS, rather\nthan local, sea ice variation (compare Figure 11d with\nFigures 4a and 4e). As discussed in section 3.3, layers 7\nand 8 are raised in the late 1980s by sea ice events that cause\nanomalously deep mixed layers (Figure 11d). After these\nevents the deep mixed layer thins by detraining dense water\ninto deep layers over the outer shelf, thickening and cooling\nthem. This increases the melt rate overall because the\nthickened dense layers newly in contact with the ice base\nremain warmer than shallower layers despite the cooling\n(Figure 11c). Physically this amounts to brine rejection from\nsea ice growth causing open ocean convection that mixes\nheat upwards from the dense CDW beneath.\n[53] This conclusion highlights the modeled differences\nbetween the AS and BS. Although the two regions are\nsuperficially similar, with warm CDW flooding the conti-\nnental shelf, there appear to be fundamental differences\nin the balance of processes controlling fluctuations in the\ntransport of CDW to ice shelf bases. Our model results\nsuggest that variation in surface processes is more important\nthan fluctuations in the transport of CDW onto the shelf,\nwhile the AS model application of Thoma et al. [2008]\nsuggests the reverse. We also find less variability in sur-\nface processes, though this may be attributable to our use of\nan improved sea ice model.\n[54] These conclusions are consistent with a range of\ndifferences in the external forcing of the two regions. The\nAS sits closer to the pole of fluctuation of the climatological\natmospheric low, causing an annual pumping of warm water\nonto the shelf and high sensitivity to interannual variations.\nThe BS is on the periphery of this region, implying a steadier\nforcing and less interannual sensitivity. In the AS the shelf\nbreak flow is uniformly westward as part of the Ross Gyre,\nwhile in the BS a westward current underlies eastward flow,\nproducing velocity shear which may lead to increased dia-\npycnal mixing. There are also topological differences in the\nice shelves of primary interest. Simple glacier outflow ice\nshelves like the tongue of Pine Island Glacier have grounding\nlines that extend to the deepest seabed, while the drafts of\n\u2018throughflow\u2019 ice shelves like GVIIS andWilkins only partly\nintrude into the water column. We have demonstrated that\nthe latter type are physically removed from the warmest deep\nwater masses, leading to an increased dependence of their\nmelt rates on surface processes affecting the upper water\ncolumn.\n[55] There are several important caveats to the conclu-\nsions of this study. Direct comparison of our results with\nthose of Thoma et al. [2008] is complicated by our usage of\nan improved sea ice model and slightly lower air\u2010ice drag\ncoefficient (10\u22123 versus 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22123; air\u2010ocean drag is 1.5 \u00d7\n10\u22123 in both studies). Our fixed boundary conditions neglect\nFigure 11. Time series of factors driving GVIIS basal melting.

As evident from our inability\nto match the detail of observations at the shelf break in\nFigure 6, our model cannot hope to fully represent the\ncomplex processes governing on\u2010shelf transport, which\nmay affect our conclusions about its relative weakness. This\nis due to the coarse grid resolution of the model, which also\nlimits our representation of ice shelf cavities in the region.\nOur annual sea\u2010ice cycle is a little too large and the mag-\nnitude of the late 1980s events are overpredicted by the\nNCEP forcing, so the influence of on\u2010shelf surface fluxes\nmay be overestimated. However, these large events could be\nregarded as useful tests that impart valuable insight into the\nprocesses controlling GVIIS melt rates. Even if our repre-\nsentation of the processes is imperfect and the events shown\nhere inaccurate, the general conclusion that GVIIS melt rate\nvariation is driven from the south by sea\u2010ice processes is\nlogical, important, and a hypothesis to be tested by future\nimproved models.\n5. Conclusions\n[56] The Antarctic Peninsula has experienced profound\nchanges in all components of its climate, but our under-\nstanding of the nearby Bellingshausen Sea has been limited\nby the sparseness of observations in time and space. By\napplying a sea ice\u2010ocean\u2010ice shelf model driven by atmo-\nspheric reanalyses, we have suggested ocean processes in\nthis area and unearthed a linkage between the oceanic\nmelting of ice shelves and variability in the wider climate\nsystem.\n[57] Modeled ocean flows corroborate and extend ob-\nservations in the region, suggesting that the summer\u2010autumn\ncoastal current is continuous from the tip of the peninsula\ninto the Amundsen Sea and that it might have a wind\u2010forced\ncomponent. Flow over the continental slope is north\u2010eastward\nin the upper layers and south\u2010westward beneath. Model sea\nice, ocean state, and George VI Ice Shelf melt rates all agree\nwith \u2018snapshot\u2019 observations taken in 1994.\n[58] Good agreement between time series of simulated\nand observed sea ice extent implies that the atmospheric\nforcing contains a realistic representation of temporal vari-\nability, so we argue that we should have some confidence in\nthe model\u2019s prediction of oceanic variability. Surface\u2010driven\nannual and interannual variability in the Bellingshausen Sea\nis found to be considerably weaker than in the nearby\nAmundsen Sea. This occurs because the Bellingshausen Sea\nis situated at the eastern end of the climatological atmo-\nspheric low pressure that oscillates between the Ross and\nAmundsen seas; winds are northerly on average in all sea-\nsons. Therefore, oceanic flows are relatively persistent and\ninsensitive to interannual fluctuations in the positioning of\nthe climatological low.\n[59] George VI Ice Shelf is the only ice shelf in the area\nfor which there are sufficient data to calibrate the model.\nOur results suggest that on average it has been melting out\nof balance (thinning) over the simulation period. A central\nbasal ridge divides the sub\u2010ice\u2010shelf circulation in two, and\nvariations in the melt rate are found primarily to be deter-\nmined by processes offshore of the southern section. The\nsupply of heat to the ice shelf base is apparently controlled by\nwater mass transformations effected by surface processes on\nthe continental shelf, rather than variations in the transport of\nCircumpolar Deep Water from the deep ocean (although the\nlatter are imperfectly modeled here). This is consistent with\nthe relative steadiness of atmospheric forcing and the fact that\nGeorge VI Ice Shelf intrudes less than 450 m into the water\ncolumn.\n[60] The observed changes in the Antarctic Peninsula\nclimate system are a strong motivation for modeling the\nBellingshausen Sea, but the reanalysis\u2010driven models used\nhere are unable to shed light upon mechanisms responsible\nfor these coupled changes. Our use of solid boundaries\nrelaxed to climatological fields means that we cannot account\nfor the important effects of oceanic variability emanating\nfrom the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Long simulation\ntimes and a largemodel domain necessitate the use of a coarse\nmodel resolution that limits our ability to model the detail of\nflow beneath ice shelves. Despite these important weak-\nnesses, the study increases our understanding of the ocean-\nography of the central Bellingshausen Sea and allows us to\ninfer the glaciological impacts of the climatic changes that\nhave occurred. Now that a basic oceanographic understand-\ning of the region has been established a coupled modeling\neffort, using open boundary conditions and a fine model grid,\nis needed to fully investigate the processes responsible for\nclimatic change in the vicinity of the Antarctic Peninsula.\n[61] Acknowledgments.
