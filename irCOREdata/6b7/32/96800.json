Introduction\nUnderstanding how spatial pattern arises is a central but still unresolved issue in developmental biology.\nIt is clear that genes play a crucial role in embryology but the study of genetics alone can not explain how\nthe complex mechanical and chemical spatio-temporal signalling cues which determine cell fate are set up\nand regulated in the early embryo. These signals are a consequence of many nonlinear interactions and\nmathematical modelling and numerical computation have an important role to play in understanding and\npredicting the outcome of such complex interactions.\nThe application of mathematical modelling to problems in developmental biology has given rise to a\nvariety of models which account for spatio-temporal patterning phenomena. In the chemical prepattern\nmodel approach it is hypothesised that a spatially homogeneous or uniform density of cells responds to\nsome spatially heterogeneous chemical pattern and differentiates according to some rules.

Madzvamuse et al. \/ Journal of Computational Physics 190 (2003) 478\u2013500 479seminal paper concerning morphogenesis, suggested a novel concept of diffusion driven instability in re-\naction\u2013diffusion systems. Since then, the reaction\u2013diffusion theory of pattern formation has been widely\napplied to biology, ecology [42], semiconductor physics [6], material science [23], hydrodynamics [50], as-\ntrophysics [35], chemistry and economics. Typical examples of biological applications of reaction\u2013diffusion\nsystems are: pattern formation in hydra [19], animal coat markings [32], butterfly wing pigmentation\npatterns [34], skeletal patterning in limb development (see for review [27]) and shell pigmentation patterns\n[28]. Detailed studies of these models have been carried out on spatial domains of one dimension and two\ndimensions with simple geometries. In nearly all these cases, the domain was considered fixed in size,\nhowever recent experimental evidence shows that domain growth may play a crucial role in pattern\nformation [22].\nFrom the biologically realistic assumption that growth occurs via a continuous deformation of the\ndomain, we can solve the system numerically using the finite element method on a continuously deforming\ndomain [4]. The essential component underlying this method is the representation of the object function by\na piecewise linear continuous function on a finite element mesh in which the nodal positions vary with time.\nThe way in which these nodes are moved and how the solution evolves is derived in the weak form of the\nmodel system. The nodal movement can either be provided by a separate definition or by a mechanism: we\nwill prescribe a specific definition for the motion of the domain and correspondingly define the motion of all\nthe nodes in the grid. This is the key difference to the moving finite element method invented by Miller [29].\nMiller does not specify the motion of the nodes, instead the nodal movement is generated automatically by\nminimising the residual of the differential equation. In his method mesh tangling may result whereas this\ncan be avoided with prescribed mesh motion (see [12,13] for more details on mesh tangling and other\nproblems). Although our work will be mainly on a two-dimensional moving grid, Sun W. [46], use the\nmoving mesh method to solve the one-dimensional Gierer\u2013Meinhardt model.\nIn Section 2 we present the model equations considered in this paper. The moving grid finite element\ntheory is described in Section 3. Here we derive the weak form of the partial differential equation and\ndescribe the Galerkin finite element approximation on a continuously deforming grid. Numerical experi-\nments are presented in Section 4 on regular and irregular growing domains. Lastly in Section 5 we present\nconclusions and discuss the implications of the novel application of the moving finite element method to\npattern formation and transition in biological problems. We also provide numerical software and docu-\nmentation for the methods described in this paper which can be freely downloaded from http:\/\/web.com-\nlab.ox.ac.uk\/oucl\/work\/andy.wathen\/software.html.2. Model equations\nThe numerical experiments in this paper will be restricted to a generalised reaction\u2013diffusion system of\ntwo chemical species which can be written in terms of non-dimensional variables as\nou\not\n\u00bc cf\u00f0u\u00de \u00fe P3\u00f0u\u00de \u00feDr2u in X\u00f0t\u00de; \u00f02:1\u00de\nwith X\u00f0t\u00de representing a time-dependent domain. Here we define\nu \u00bc u\nv\n\u0001 \u0002\n; f \u00bc f \u00f0u; v\u00de\ng\u00f0u; v\u00de\n\u0001 \u0002\n; P3 \u00bc\np3\u00f0u; v\u00de\nq3\u00f0u; v\u00de\n\u0001 \u0002\n; D \u00bc Du 0\n0 Dv\n\u0001 \u0002\n; x \u00bc x\u00f0t\u00de; y\u00f0t\u00de\u00f0 \u00de;\nwhere u; v are the two chemical concentrations under investigation, f ; g; p3; q3 are reaction kinetics, and D is\nthe diffusion matrix (Du and Dv are constant diffusion parameters). In a number of important applications\nthe parameters c and d are the most important and this is why they are explicitly included in (2.1).\n480 A. Madzvamuse et al. \/ Journal of Computational Physics 190 (2003) 478\u2013500Initial conditions are given by u\u00f0x; 0\u00de \u00bc u0\u00f0x\u00de where u0\u00f0x\u00de is a prescribed non-negative continuous\nbounded function. Boundary conditions can be of Dirichlet type (u and\/or v given on the boundary) or of\n(homogeneous) Neumann type which describe zero-flux of u (or v) out of the boundary. Initial conditions\nare defined as small random perturbations about the uniform homogeneous steady state, if it exists (i.e., a\nstate u \u00bc constant, v \u00bc constant satisfying the boundary conditions and equations (2.1)).\nBelow we consider three special cases where c 6\u00bc 0 and p3\u00f0u; v\u00de \u00bc 0 \u00bc q3\u00f0u; v\u00de. In each case we give a brief\ndescription of each model and its physical interpretation.\n2.1. Gierer\u2013Meinhardt reaction kinetics\nThis is a phenomenological model suggested by Gierer and Meinhardt [19] whereby reaction kinetics are\nchosen in such a way that one of the chemicals (termed activator) activates the production of the other\nchemical (the inhibitor) which, in turn, inhibits the production of the activator. The non-dimensionalised\nreaction\u2013diffusion system is given by\nou\not\n\u00bc c a\n\u0001\n\u0001 bu\u00fe u\n2\nv\u00f01\u00fe ku2\u00de\n\u0002\n\u00fer2u; \u00f02:2\u00de\nov\not\n\u00bc c u2\u0003 \u0001 v\u0004\u00fe dr2v; \u00f02:3\u00de\nwhere u\u00f0x; y; t\u00de is the concentration of the activator, v\u00f0x; y; t\u00de is the concentration of the inhibitor, t is time\nand r2 \u00bc \u00f0o2=ox2\u00de \u00fe \u00f0o2=oy2\u00de is the two-dimensional Laplacian. a, b, d and c are all non-dimensionalised\npositive parameters and k is a measure of the saturation concentration (see for example [33]). The biological\ninterpretation of the reaction kinetics in (2.2) is that u is produced at a constant rate ca and is degraded\nlinearly at rate cb. The c\u00bdu2=v\u00f01\u00fe ku2\u00de\u0002 term implies autocatalysis in u with saturation at high concentration\nvalues of u, and inhibition of u through the production of v. In Eq. (2.3), v is activated (produced) by u and\ndegraded linearly.\n2.2. Thomas reaction kinetics\nThis model is based on a specific substrate\u2013inhibition reaction involving the substrates oxygen (v\u00f0x; y; t\u00de)\nand uric acid (u\u00f0x; y; t\u00de) which react in the presence of the enzyme uricase. The reaction kinetics, derived by\nfitting the kinetics to experimental data [47], can be written in non-dimensional form as\nou\not\n\u00bc c a\u00f0 \u0001 u\u0001 h\u00f0u; v\u00de\u00de \u00fe r2u; \u00f02:4\u00de\nov\not\n\u00bc c ab\u00f0 \u0001 av\u0001 h\u00f0u; v\u00de\u00de \u00fe dr2v \u00f02:5\u00de\nwith h\u00f0u; v\u00de \u00bc quv=\u00f01\u00fe u\u00fe Ku2\u00de. Here a; b; d; c; a; q and K are positive parameters. The term h\u00f0u; v\u00de\nindicates the rate at which u and v are used up, in particular h\u00f0u; v\u00de exhibits what is known as substrate\u2013\ninhibition, that is, for small u, h\u00f0u; v\u00de increases with u, while it decreases with large u.\n2.3. Schnakenberg reaction kinetics\nThis is one of the simplest reaction\u2013diffusion models. It is derived from a series of hypothetical tri-\nmolecular autocatalytic reactions proposed by Schnakenberg [41]. In non-dimensional form the system is\nwritten as\nA.

The biological interpretation follows as above, with the term u2v\nrepresenting nonlinear activation of u and nonlinear consumption for v.\n2.4.

Note that\nthe Schnakenberg reaction kinetics is a special case of (2.8). Another special case is the Gray and Scott\n[17,18] model. More special cases can be found in the papers by Barrio et al. [7,8] and Arag\u0001on et al. [2,3].\n2.5. Parameter values\nThe parameter values in the reaction terms are those that give a constant uniform steady state in the\nabsence of diffusion. In our investigations, these are taken from the literature [33]. However, the values of c\nand the diffusion coefficient d are determined from the conditions that give rise to Turing instability. Turing\ninstability or diffusion-driven instability occurs when a uniform steady state, linearly stable in the absence\nof diffusion, goes unstable in the presence of diffusion. The process of determining these parameter values is\nknown as linear stability analysis (Appendix A). On regular two-dimensional shapes, standard linear sta-\nbility analysis yields general solutions which are linear combinations of products of sine or cosine functions\nwith mode \u00f0m; n\u00de. These are the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian with homogeneous Neumann or Dirichlet\n(at the uniform steady state) boundary conditions. Comparisons will be made between the numerically\ncomputed inhomogeneous steady-state solutions and their corresponding eigenfuctions on regular\ndomains.3.

The key difference to the moving finite element method invented by Miller [30] is that we prescribe a\nspecific definition for the nodal movement _ai. We assume that nodal movement can be determined or\nprescribed, for example, by growth rates derived from biological observations. This is the novelty of our\nnumerical method. As far as we know this is the first work to demonstrate a novel way of moving the grid\nby use of a defined function which describes growth of the problem domain.3.1. Spatial discretisation: finite element method\nIn order to discretise the model Eq. (2.1) in space, one has to divide the domain under consideration into\na series of non-overlapping sub-domains or elements. The problem is then approximated within each of\nthese elements, and the corresponding element contributions are summed to create a global system of\nequations.\nThe discretisation of the geometry is carried out by using triangular elements with a piecewise linear\napproximation to the solution. We impose the conditions that the elements must cover the entire domain\nwithout leaving gaps (except perhaps at the boundary), that is, any pair of elements intersect along a\ncomplete edge, at a vertex or not at all. If we cover a region X\u00f0t\u00de with triangular elements, then each element\nA. Madzvamuse et al. \/ Journal of Computational Physics 190 (2003) 478\u2013500 483can be mapped onto a standard fixed regular triangle at time t. This simplifies the required integration over\neach triangular element.\nLet U be defined as in (3.1) such that the family of the functions \/i are linearly independent.

If the domain is fixed\nin time, UX and UY are zero matrices. Solving (3.28) gives us an approximation to the classical solution u.\n3.3. Time-stepping\nThe discretisation of the time derivative and the linearisation of nonlinear terms are carried out si-\nmultaneously. The nonlinear terms can be written in matrix-vector-product form where the matrix depends\non either U or both U and V (for specific details, see [24]). This form makes it possible to linearise the\nnonlinear terms by use of the Picard iteration method [38]. For example, the term U 2, can be written as a\nproduct of UmUm\u00fe1 where Um is the known solution calculated from the previous time mDt. On a con-\ntinuously moving grid this will be equivalent to calculating the successive solution Um\u00fe1, where the previous\nsolution Um is evaluated on the new grid. The Picard iteration method is combined with the implicit\nbackward Euler finite difference scheme to yield a robust and stable scheme. To solve the set of linear\nalgebraic equations obtained, a preconditioned generalised minimum residual method is used. Precondi-\ntioners such as ILU(0), ILUT, ILUTP, ILUK and MILU(0) can be used with the method [39,40]. In all our\nsimulations we employ ILU(0).

Transient solutions on regular and irregular growing domains\nWe investigate the role of domain growth on pattern selection and transition on regular and irregular\ngrowing domains. The assumption is that the evolution of the solutions of the model equations takes place\non the same timescale as domain growth. In Section 3, we pointed out that domain growth is prescribed.\n486 A. Madzvamuse et al. \/ Journal of Computational Physics 190 (2003) 478\u2013500Biologically we assume that the nodal movement can be derived from experimental data. However, for\nillustrative purposes, we prescribe specific growth functions that continuously deform the domain.\nOne of the simplest ways to do this is to assume that the boundary deforms uniformly. Although there is\nno biological justification for this type of growth, Crampin et al. [15] studied and presented numerical\nresults on uniform and non-uniform domain growth in one dimension. Hence we consider that the nodal\nmovement can be written as a product of two functions, one that depends on the initial grid only and\nanother that depends on time only. We can therefore define x\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc Xr\u00f0t\u00de and y\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc Yr\u00f0t\u00de, to represent the\nboundary grid movement where X and Y are the initial boundary grid coordinates of x\u00f00\u00de and y\u00f00\u00de, re-\nspectively, at time t \u00bc 0. The velocity of grid movement is given by _x\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc X _r\u00f0t\u00de and _y\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc Y _r\u00f0t\u00de. The above\nis valid if the function r\u00f0t\u00de satisfies the property r\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 1 at time t \u00bc 0. For illustrative purposes we will\nchoose an exponential function of the form r\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc ert, tP 0. One of the assumptions on domain growth is\nthat it is slow and for this we require that r be a small parameter. This form of domain growth has been\nused previously in the study of robust pattern formation under domain growth [14,36,37]. In their studies r\nis assumed to be of the order 10\u00012\u201310\u00015. For the sake of comparison with their work where possible, we\nassume that the parameter is of the same magnitude. Observe that the boundary continuously deforms. The\nnew positions of the internal grid coordinates need to be calculated: here, we apply a spring analogy [10] to\ncalculate the internal mesh movement. The spring analogy is a common technique for deforming a mesh,\nand consists of replacing the mesh by fictitious springs. There are two types of springs, the vertex and the\nsegment spring analogies. The vertex spring is used mainly to refine a particular mesh, while the segment\nspring is appropriate for deforming and moving a given mesh. This technique preserves the number of grid\ncoordinates and the mesh connectivity which enables smooth evolution. The initial mesh and the boundary\ngrid points are generated by a Delaunay mesh generator [31]. All the numerical simulations are carried out\non a typical mesh of approximately 4000 elements with approximately 2000 nodes.\nIn all our simulations the pattern transition on growing domains is independent of numerical parameters\nsuch as mesh size and time-step. By refining the mesh and time-step sizes, numerical solutions remain\nqualitatively similar with only small quantitative changes occurring. Numerical simulations have been\ncarried out with different time-steps and different mesh sizes and the transition process was observed to be\nqualitatively unchanged. Numerical convergence for our method can be shown in terms of mesh grid re-\nfinement and at least first order rate of convergence with respect to the number of mesh points has been\nobserved (see [24]).\nIn this paper, we plot the contour profiles of the inhomogeneous steady-state solutions only. This is\nmainly for biological interpretation. In the biological context colour patterns are linked to cell differenti-\nation. Assuming that coloration is determined by a constant threshold value in u (or v) concentration, us (or\nvs) say, such that cells in the region where uP us are black, while cells which experience a concentration\nu < us are coloured white, these give rise to the shading illustrated in all the figures. The actual solution\nsurfaces (u or v) are as depicted in Fig. 1.\n4.1. Transient solutions on regular domains: Schnakenberg kinetics\n4.1.1. Stripe-to-stripe patterns\nFor illustrative purposes, we solve the Schnakenberg model equations with homogeneous Neumann\nboundary conditions applied to both u and v. Let us first consider square and rectangular domains. The\nsimplest form of growth is when it occurs along one axis of the domain. This can be viewed as an extension\nof one-dimensional domain growth where values of x or of y are fixed as constants. A typical example of\nthis growth is shown in Figs. 2(a) and (b). We let the initial unit square grow exponentially along the x-axis\nuntil it reaches the final domain, taken here to be \u00bd0; 6\u0002 \u0004 \u00bd0; 1\u0002. The numerically computed transient so-\nlutions of the model equations on a growing unit square in this example consist of an elongating stripe.\nFrom linear stability theory (Appendix A), the parameter values of c and d are selected such that the \u00f01; 0\u00de\nFig. 1. The solution surfaces of u and v illustrating the type of shading used.\nA. Madzvamuse et al. \/ Journal of Computational Physics 190 (2003) 478\u2013500 487mode is isolated on a unit square. Linear stability theory predicts that \u00f00; 1\u00de is always an excitable mode on\nthe domain \u00bd0; L\u0002 \u0004 \u00bd0; 1\u0002 for any length L. The corresponding eigenfunction of the Laplacian with homo-\ngeneous Neumann boundary conditions on this domain can be shown to be given by cospy. Hence the\nstripe pattern produced from the transient solutions is consistent with predictions from linear stability\ntheory.\nIf, however we prescribe initial conditions which are biased towards the pattern generated by the ei-\ngenfunction cospx on a unit square, we obtain the numerical solution illustrated in Figs. 2(c)\u2013(e). As the\nunit square continues to grow exponentially along the x-axis, the transient solution changes orientation.\nThe domain is grown until it reaches the size \u00bd0; 8\u0002 \u0004 \u00bd0; 1\u0002. In both simulations, the numerical solution of\nthe model equations under this form of domain growth with these parameter values produces stripeFig. 2. The domain \u00bd0; 1\u0002 \u0004 \u00bd0; 1\u0002 is grown exponentially to reach the final domain \u00bd0; 6\u0002 \u0004 \u00bd0; 1\u0002. The Schnakenberg model is solved with\nparameter values a \u00bc 1:0, b \u00bc 0:9, c \u00bc 29 and d \u00bc 10. (a,b) A stripe is generated and simply elongates as the domain grows along the x-\naxis. (c)\u2013(e) The unit square domain is grown exponentially to reach the final \u00bd0; 8\u0002 \u0004 \u00bd0; 1\u0002 domain. Initial conditions are chosen such\nthat a stripe parallel to the y-axis is produced. The orientation of the pattern changes completely as the domain grows, a stripe emerges\nperpendicular to the y-axis, recapturing the orientation in (b).\nFig. 3. Numerically computed spatially inhomogeneous steady-state solution on a fixed domain \u00bd0; 8\u0002 \u0004 \u00bd0; 1\u0002 with random initial\nconditions. This type of solution is not observed on a growing unit square as shown in Figs. 2(a)\u2013(e).\n488 A. Madzvamuse et al. \/ Journal of Computational Physics 190 (2003) 478\u2013500patterns independent of initial conditions. This indicates that pattern selection under domain growth can be\ninsensitive to initial conditions when these are small amplitude perturbations about the uniform steady\nstate.\nIn order to highlight the crucial role of growth in pattern selection we illustrate in Fig. 3 the result of\nsolving the model equations on a fixed domain with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions and a\nrandom initial condition but with exactly the same parameter values as in Fig. 2. Instead of horizontal\nstripes, vertical stripes are obtained. This solution is not computed nor observed under the domain growth\nof Fig. 2, and quite possibly under no form of dynamic domain elongation. Thus it is apparent that domain\ngrowth enhances the robustness of pattern selection.\nThe concept of robustness of pattern selection and transition is still to be fully understood and con-\nceptualised. In this simple case, we can show by use of linear stability analysis how domain growth en-\nhances the robustness of pattern formation. From linear stability theory, the parameter values are selected\nsuch that the \u00f00; 1\u00de (or equally \u00f01; 0\u00de) mode is isolated on a unit square. That is the uniform steady state can\nonly go unstable to this unique (up to p=2 rotational symmetry of the domain) admissible mode which has a\npositive growth rate. Once the parameter values are selected, these are fixed as the unit square deforms. If it\nis deformed continuously along the x-axis, the \u00f00; 1\u00de mode is always an admissible mode but it is not the\nonly admissible mode. Once the \u00f00; 1\u00de mode has been selected and nonlinearly evolves, other growing\nmodes appear not to be relevant. However if the domain is fixed, as shown in Fig. 3, the growth rate of the\n\u00f00; 1\u00de mode is less than the growth rate of some other acceptable mode and it is therefore less likely to be\nobserved or computed. The spatially inhomogeneous solution obtained will crucially depend on the initial\nconditions chosen. We remark that analytical linear stability theory becomes nontrivial and complicated for\nmixed modes. Moreover, it cannot address the problem of nonlinear pattern selection, for which no\nstandard theory exists.\n4.1.2. Stripe-to-spot patterns\nLet us consider now a different form of growth from the essentially one-dimensional form described\npreviously. Suppose we let the unit square grow along the diagonal giving rise to successively larger square\ndomains.\nFor illustrative purposes, we choose parameter values determined to isolate the \u00f01; 0\u00de mode on a unit\nsquare. The transient solution of the model equations with these parameter values on a growing unit square\nare shown as the sequence of frames in Fig. 4. As the domain grows a stripe pattern transforms into a spot\npattern. This evolution process occurs through peak insertion, whereby a stripe evolves into a spot pattern.\nFurther domain growth shows peak splitting from a single spot to four spots. This result has been observed\nbefore [14].\nHence we have observed in one simulation the insertion and splitting of peaks. As the evolution of four\nspots continues they merge to form oblique stripes due to peak insertion. When the growing domain\nreaches \u00bd0; 3:5\u0002 \u0004 \u00bd0; 3:5\u0002, a circular pattern is observed. On further growth, the domain passes through\nFig. 4. Transient patterns generated by the Schnakenberg model as the unit square is grown along the diagonal line x \u00bc y at constant\nspeed in the positive direction. The parameter values in the numerical computations are a \u00bc 0:1, b \u00bc 0:9, d \u00bc 10 and c \u00bc 10. Stripes\nevolve to spots which in turn evolve into circular patterns as the domain grows. Further growth transforms these back into spots.\nHowever, when domain growth is stopped, the spatially inhomogeneous steady-state solution computed to which the system converges\nis that of stripes.\nA. Madzvamuse et al. \/ Journal of Computational Physics 190 (2003) 478\u2013500 489another transition point. Although the circular pattern is still more pronounced on the domain\n\u00bd0; 3:6\u0002 \u0004 \u00bd0; 3:6\u0002, we observe peak insertion as the domain grows. This gives rise to the formation of spots as\nthe circular pattern breaks down. Spots are illustrated more clearly on the domains from \u00bd0; 3:7\u0002 \u0004 \u00bd0; 3:7\u0002\nup to the domain \u00bd0; 4:5\u0002 \u0004 \u00bd0; 4:5\u0002. When the domain reaches the final domain size, taken here to be\n\u00bd0; 4:5\u0002 \u0004 \u00bd0; 4:5\u0002, the simulation converges to a spatially inhomogeneous steady state on this fixed domain.\nSurprisingly, stripes are produced in favour of spots. It appears therefore that growth stabilises spots over\nstripes. It certainly indicates that dynamic growth significantly affects patterning. However more detailed\nand extensive numerical experiments are required to confirm this. Different random initial conditions have\nbeen prescribed as small perturbations about the uniform steady state and we have observed qualitatively\n490 A. Madzvamuse et al. \/ Journal of Computational Physics 190 (2003) 478\u2013500similar sequences, hence we conclude that pattern transition under domain growth is insensitive locally to\ninitial data.\n4.1.3. Spot-to-stripe-to-spot patterns\nFig. 5 illustrates a pattern sequence in which spots and stripes are produced in an alternating fashion.\nParameters are chosen such that linear theory predicts evolution to the \u00f02; 2\u00de mode on the unit square. The\ncorresponding eigenfunction is given by cos\u00f02px\u00de cos\u00f02py\u00de with eigenvalue k2;2 \u00bc 8p2. The pattern shown in\nFig. 5(a) is obtained from the numerical solution of the model equations on a unit square and is consistent\nwith this eigenfunction.\nWhen the unit square is grown exponentially along the diagonal y \u00bc x to reach the domain\n\u00bd0; 1:6\u0002 \u0004 \u00bd0; 1:6\u0002 it passes through a region where spots become inadmissible patterns. Instead of spots,\nstripes are formed (Fig. 5(b)). This process is independent of the initial conditions. We have carried out\nnumerical tests with different initial conditions and with more refined grids and obtained the same results.\nOn further growth, up to \u00bd0; 1:8\u0002 \u0004 \u00bd0; 1:8\u0002, the reverse takes place, stripes becoming inadmissible while spots\nare generated, as shown in Fig. 5(c). With further growth, this process is repeated (Figs. 5(d)\u2013(f)). The\npattern obtained in Fig. 5(e) compares qualitatively with the predictions from linear theory that the ei-\ngenfunction cos\u00bd\u00f06p=2:4\u00dey\u0002 of the Laplacian with zero-flux boundary conditions on this domain should\ngrow. If domain growth stops, at say \u00bd0; 2:8\u0002 \u0004 \u00bd0; 2:8\u0002, and the simulations allowed to converge, the pattern\nproduced is a mixture of spots and stripes.\nSo far we have investigated the role of domain growth by growing a unit square domain exponentially\neither along one of the axes to produce rectangular domains or along one of the diagonals producing square\ndomains. We have extended this study to a number of growing domains including a right-angled isosceles\ntriangle, an equilateral triangle and a hexagon [24]. We present results only for the growing hexagon. We\ncomment that solutions on a growing equilateral triangle display one of two properties; either they are\nsymmetrical with respect to a 120\u0002 rotation about the centre or they are symmetrical about an altitude.Fig. 5. Transient solutions of the Schnakenberg model on the unit square growing along the diagonal y \u00bc x. The parameter values are\nchosen such that the \u00f02; 2\u00de mode is isolated on a unit square. These are given as a \u00bc 0:1, b \u00bc 0:9, d \u00bc 8:6676 and c \u00bc 230:82. The\nobserved transient patterns are spots, stripes and spots alternating repeatedly as the domain grows.\nA. Madzvamuse et al. \/ Journal of Computational Physics 190 (2003) 478\u2013500 4914.1.4. Transient patterns on a hexagon\nWe investigate the role of domain growth on a hexagon of unit side given by the vertices (1, 0); (1\n2\n;\nffiffi\n3\np\n2\n);\n(\u0001 1\n2\n;\nffiffi\n3\np\n2\n); (\u00011; 0); (\u0001 1\n2\n;\u0001\nffiffi\n3\np\n2\n) and (1\n2\n;\u0001\nffiffi\n3\np\n2\n). The hexagon is allowed to grow exponentially from its centre to\nthree times its original size. Fig. 6 shows the corresponding numerical solutions of the model system with\nhomogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The parameter values are unchanged from those used on the\nequilateral triangle.Fig. 6. Typical numerically computed patterns on a growing hexagon for the Schnakenberg model with parameter values a \u00bc 0:1,\nb \u00bc 0:9, d \u00bc 10 and c \u00bc 114. Stripe, spot and circular patterns are exhibited. Circular patterns become pronounced as the hexagon\ngrows in size. As the domain reaches its maximum size, the system evolves to an inhomogeneous steady-state solution consisting of\nstripes and spots.\nFig. 7.

Madzvamuse et al. \/ Journal of Computational Physics 190 (2003) 478\u2013500\nA. Madzvamuse et al. \/ Journal of Computational Physics 190 (2003) 478\u2013500 493Initially we observe stripes (Fig. 6(a)) evolving to spots as the domain grows as shown in Fig. 6(b). These\nspots further evolve to stripes (Figs. 6(c) and (d)). A mixed mode solution then gives rise to circular patterns\nas illustrated in the sequence shown in Figs. 6(e)\u2013(k). The circular patterns continue to evolve as the domain\ndeforms continuously until it reaches its final size. On this fixed domain the spatially inhomogeneous\nsteady-state pattern obtained is that of stripes and spots combined (Fig. 6(l)). The sequence illustrated is\nindependent of the initial conditions.\nAlthough this sequence exhibits several features in common with our previous simulations above, a new\npattern is observed, namely circular patterns. The appearance of such patterns seems to be due to the nature\nof the geometry. The circular patterns appear as transient solutions when stripes and spots occur at almost\nthe same time but neither solution dominates due to domain growth. Such patterns have been observed in\nzebrafish [37] and Pomacanthus [22]. This phenomenon could explain the emergence of circular patterns of\npigmentation on fish which takes place as the fish grows in size. A combination of spots and stripes are\nobserved when the zebrafish attains its maximum size, which compares qualitatively with the inhomoge-\nneous steady-state pattern computed on the final fixed domain. When the domain reaches its final size the\nnumerical solution converges to a mixed pattern of stripes and spots (Fig. 6(l)). The evolution of the\ntransient solutions on the growing domain is insensitive to the initial conditions. Therefore under domain\ngrowth the model is robust as the patterns generated are independent of the initial conditions, when these\nare small amplitude perturbations about the uniform steady state.\n4.2. Transient solutions on irregular domains: Gierer\u2013Meinhardt kinetics\nThe aim of this section is to illustrate the generality of our numerical technique in dealing with arbitrary\nsimply connected domains. This work was motivated by the study of growth colour patterns in the butterfly\nwing Papilio dardanus. The biological background to the mathematical problem is well documented in the\npapers by Sekimura et al. [43\u201345] and in the book by Nijhout [34].

The scale changes in Figs. 8 and 9 are small compared to the rest of the previous figures.\nTherefore we plot the figures on the same scale \u00bd\u00012; 2:6\u0002 \u0004 \u00bd\u00012; 2\u0002 and this is not shown in the illustrated\nfigures.Fig. 8.

Spot patterns continue to evolve with domain growth. The numerical simulations are\ncarried out on a typical mesh of 4730 elements with 2466 nodes.\nFig. 9. Fig. 8 continued.

Conclusion and discussion\nThe novel application of the moving grid finite element method to reaction\u2013diffusion systems on a\ncontinuously deforming domain has opened new avenues in the study of pattern formation and transition\nin Biology. In particular, we have developed a freely available software package that can be used not only\nto investigate pattern formation, but also to predict pattern transition. All results reported in this paper are\nproduced with this package and it can be downloaded from: http:\/\/web.comlab.ox.ac.uk\/oucl\/work\/an-\ndy.wathen\/software.html.\nThis technique has been applied to the study of colour pattern formation of the butterfly wing\nP. dardanus [25,26,45], and growth patterns in bivalve ligaments [25,26,48].\n496 A. Madzvamuse et al. \/ Journal of Computational Physics 190 (2003) 478\u2013500We have observed that stripes can evolve into stripes, spots into spots and sometimes stripes evolve into\nspots which in turn involve into circular patterns. The emergence of such exotic patterns is due to domain\ngrowth. Domain growth appears to enhance robustness in pattern selection and transition: lack of ro-\nbustness has been one of the main criticisms of the Turing theory of pattern formation on fixed domains.\nThe generality of our numerical method allows us to carry out further investigative real studies into\npattern transition in biological problems. Currently we are investigating growth patterns of the butterfly\nwing P. dardanus and of the zebrafish.Acknowledgements\nThis work (AM) was supported by a grant from EPSRC Life Sciences Initiative (GR\/R03914).

Linear analysis\nStandard linear stability analysis shows that diffusion-driven instability of a uniform steady state of the\nsystems (2.2)\u2013(2.8) occurs if the following conditions hold (see, for example, the books by [16,33]:\nfu \u00fe gv < 0; \u00f0A:1\u00defugv \u0001 fvgu > 0; \u00f0A:2\u00dedfu \u00fe gv > 0; \u00f0A:3\u00de\u00f0dfu \u00fe gv\u00de2 \u0001 4d\u00f0fugv \u0001 fvgu\u00de > 0; \u00f0A:4\u00de\nwhere the partial derivatives are evaluated at the steady state. Inequalities (A.1)\u2013(A.4) define a domain of\nparameter space, known as the Turing space, wherein the uniform steady state is unstable to random small\nperturbations.\nUnder these conditions, spatial disturbances with wavenumbers k 2 \u00f0k\u0001; k\u00fe\u00de will initially grow, where\nk2\u0005 \u00bc c\n\u00f0dfu \u00fe gv\u00de \u0005\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\u00f0dfu \u00fe gv\u00de2 \u0001 4d\u00f0fugv \u0001 fvgu\u00de\nq\n2d\n: \u00f0A:5\u00de\nIn the case we are interested in, namely, the unit square with zero flux boundary conditions, a further\nrestriction on k is that it must take discrete values p\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nm2 \u00fe n2p , corresponding to the spatial mode\ncosmpx cos npy denoted by \u00f0m; n\u00de.\nFor diffusion-driven instability to occur we require that the Turing conditions (A.1)\u2013(A.4) are satisfied\nand if we wish to isolate a certain mode, say \u00f0m; n\u00de, then\nk2max6 k2\u0001 < k2m;n \u00bc p2\u00f0m2 \u00fe n2\u00de < k2\u00fe6 k2min; \u00f0A:6\u00de\nwhere\nk2max \u00bc maxf8k2p;q : k2p;q < k2m;n for some p; qg; \u00f0A:7\u00de\nTable 2\nValues for d and c under which a particular mode is isolated on a unit square domain for the Gierer\u2013Meinhardt, Thomas and\nSchnakenberg models\nMode \u00f0m; n\u00de Gierer\u2013Meinhardt Thomas Schnakenberg\nd c d c d c\n(1,0) 520.1573 67 427.0152 44 10 29\n(1,1) 105.1573 168.8 39.0152 79 11.5776 70.6\n(2,0) 84.1573 238.26 54.0152 122 10 114\n(2,1) 77.6473 411.42 29.0152 170 9.1676 176.72\n(2,2) 75.1573 483.43 30.9152 252 8.6676 230.82\n(3,0) 70.8473 619.45 36.0152 269 8.6176 265.22\n(3,1) 72.1573 756.23 27.5152 320 8.6676 329.20\n(3,2) 73.1573 901.38 28.4152 402 8.8676 379.21\n(3,3) 70.5573 1266.99 28.5152 553 8.6076 535.09\n(4,0) 71.1573 1033.51 31.5152 473 8.6676 435.99\n(4,1) 70.3573 1164.86 27.0252 506 8.5876 492.28\n(4,2) 71.1573 1519.87 27.0252 596 8.7176 625.35\n(4,3) 71.1573 1580.66 27.0252 745 8.6676 666.82\n(4,4) 73.1473 2167 27.0252 953 8.6076 909.66\nA.

Cubic spline interpolation\nThe basic idea of a cubic spline interpolation is that given a tabulated function, xi \u00bc xi\u00f0ti\u00de; yi \u00bc yi\u00f0ti\u00de,\ni \u00bc 1; . . . ; n, we determine the intermediate values of \u00f0x; y\u00de of the function say between frame 1 and 2, that is\nat time 12 and 18 h, every 15 s. n is the number of frames. For illustrative purposes, let us consider the time\ninterval ti and ti\u00fe1, i \u00bc 1; . . . ; n\u0001 1. The aim is to obtain an interpolation formula that is smooth in the first\nderivative and continuous in the second derivative, both within an interval and at its boundaries. The\ninterpolation can be shown to be of the form\n\u00f0x; y\u00de \u00bc C0 \u00f0xj; yj\u00de \u00fe C1 \u00f0xj\u00fe1; yj\u00fe1\u00de \u00fe C2 \u00f0x00j ; y00j \u00de \u00fe C3 \u00f0x00j\u00fe1; y00j\u00fe1\u00de \u00f0B:1\u00de\nwith j \u00bc 1; . . . ; nbry, nbry is the number of boundary grid coordinates. 00 denotes the second derivative with\nrespect to time, and\nC0 \u00bc tj\u00fe1 \u0001 ttj\u00fe1 \u0001 tj ; C1 \u00bc 1\u0001 C0 \u00bc\nt \u0001 tj\ntj\u00fe1 \u0001 tj ; C2 \u00bc\n1\n6\n\u00f0C30 \u0001 C0\u00de\u00f0tj\u00fe1 \u0001 tj\u00de2; C3 \u00bc\n1\n6\n\u00f0C30 \u0001 C0\u00de\u00f0tj\u00fe1 \u0001 tj\u00de2:\nNow, the assumption of continuity of the first derivative across the boundary between any two intervals,\ngives rise to the system of equations\n498 A.

Eq. (B.2) is tridiagonal, which is a huge practical ad-\nvantage. Therefore the system of equations are solved in O\u00f0N\u00de operations by the tridiagonal algorithm.\nOnce the \u00f0X;Y\u00de boundary coordinates are obtained through the cubic spline interpolation, we apply the\nspring analogy to calculate and move the new interior coordinates from the old coordinates.B.1. Mesh movement using the spring analogy\nThe spring analogy is a common technique of deforming a mesh [10]. It consists of replacing the mesh by\nfictitious springs. There are two types of springs, the vertex and the segment spring analogies. The vertex\nspring is used mainly to refine a particular mesh, while the segment spring is appropriate for deforming and\nmoving a given mesh. In both cases, the segments are considered as springs. The springs are linear and\nHooke\u0001s law is applied to determine the displacements of the nodes. For the segment springs, the equi-\nlibrium lengths of the springs are equal to the initial lengths of the segments. The force at each node i, say, is\ndetermined by\nFi \u00bc\nXni\nj\u00bc1\naij\u00f0dj \u0001 di\u00de: \u00f0B:3\u00de\nHere, di is the displacement of node i, ni is the total number of nodes surrounding node i. aij is the spring\nstiffness which according to Batima [9], is given by aij \u00bc 1=\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\u00f0xi \u0001 xj\u00de2 \u00fe \u00f0yi \u0001 yj\u00de2\nq\n. At static equilibrium, Fi\nis zero, and applying Dirichlet boundary conditions, we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations whose\nunknowns are new displacements. The nodal displacements are therefore calculated as xnewi \u00bc xoldi \u00fe dfinali .\nObserve that the system\nOi \u00bc\nXni\nj\u00bc1\naij\u00f0dj \u0001 di\u00de \u00f0B:4\u00de\nis symmetric and positive definite. The resultant matrix on the left-hand side for the unknown displace-\nments is an M-matrix. When a boundary is moved or deformed, the boundary nodal positions are strongly\nimposed by Dirichlet boundary conditions. The system is solved by a preconditioned Conjugate Gradient\nmethod where the preconditioner is determined by an incomplete Cholesky factorisation [39].References\n[1] R.A.
