Instead of rule purely by \u2018the greater number\u2019 \u2013 simple\nmajority rule \u2013 the draft Constitution prescribes \u2018qualified majority\u2019 rule, with decisions\nof the European Council or Council of Ministers sometimes requiring the consent of as\nmany as two-thirds of the member states, \u2018representing at least three fifths of the population\nof the Union\u2019.1\nSuch \u2018special\u2019 (or \u2018qualified\u2019 or \u2018super\u2019) majority requirements are not uncommon.2 It\nmay take only a majority vote of both houses of the US Congress to declare war; but it\ntakes a two-thirds majority to override a president\u2019s veto or three-fifths to close Senate\ndebate.3 Increasing taxes requires the support of between three-fifths and three-quarters\nof legislators in many American states.4 Criminal verdicts must be unanimous, or nearly\nso.5\nSuper-majorities are sometimes seen as second-best forms of unanimity rules, employed\nwhere decisions ought ideally to be unanimous but where the costs of securing unanimity\n* Social & Political Theory and Philosophy Programs, RSSS, Australian National University, Canberra;\nDepartment of Government, London School of Economics, respectively.

Hence, such rules have a powerful\nconservative bias.7 That is precisely their attraction, for those attracted to them.\nJustifying special-majority rules thus appears to be largely a matter of justifying their\nconservative bias. Sometimes the bias seems justified. Most of us, for example, think it\nright that there should be a presumption of innocence in criminal trials, and that it should\nbe hard to overcome that presumption.8 Usually, however, the bias is controversial.9\nSometimes there is not even a single status quo.10 Still other times, there seems no more\nreason for a decision procedure to be biased in one direction rather than the other. Civil\ntrials, for example, are decided on the \u2018balance of probabilities\u2019. The same standard of\nproof falls on both parties, rather than (as in criminal cases) one side having to establish\nits case \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 and the other side winning by default otherwise.\nThe reluctance to let social decisions be determined by some arbitrary bias built into\nsuper-majority rules is captured in the complaint, \u2018It would be impossible to get the\nrequisite majority for the status quo, either!\u201911 What is ordinarily taken to follow from that\nthought is that, when we have no grounds for \u2018a presumption one way or the other\u2019, then\n6 James M.

Likewise with the criminal jury:\nideally, we should convict someone only by a unanimous verdict; but where that cannot be obtained, at least we\nshould demand a large (ten-to-two) majority. And likewise in amending constitutions: every state\u2019s consent was\nrequired in joining the union, so ideally every state\u2019s consent should be required in changing the terms of\nassociation; it may be impractical to demand unanimous consent to every amendment, but at least a large majority\n(three-quarters, in the United States) ought to be required.\n7 William F.

Others demur. Economists\nmay think that there should be a presumption in favour of sticking to our long-term economic objectives, rather\nthan succumbing to short-term temptations, and that central bankers operate according to super-majority rules to\nensure that. Others demur, recalling with Keynes that \u2018in the long term we are all dead\u2019.

As Rae puts\nit, \u2018If all outcomes were subject to unanimity, then we would risk [being in] the position in which we both\nrefused to change policy and refused to keep it the same\u2019; Douglas W. Rae, \u2018The Limits of Consensual Decision\u2019,\nAmerican Political Science Review, 69 (1975), 1270\u201394, at p. 1279.\nSpecial Majorities Rationalized 215\nwe must \u2018surely abide by a simple majority\u2019.12 To implement a super-majority rule in such\ncases would be to privilege, arbitrarily, whichever outcome is identified as the default\noption.\nThat problem of arbitrariness derives from the asymmetry of the familiar sorts of\nspecial-majority rules. One option is identified as the \u2018default option\u2019: it prevails if the\nother option does not secure the requisite \u2018special majority\u2019.13 The default option can thus\nprevail without the support of anything approaching the requisite \u2018special majority\u2019,\nwhereas the other option can prevail only if it does have such support. So ordinary\nspecial-majority rules are actually Asymmetrical Special-Majority rules (although they\nare not usually so labelled); and that asymmetry is the source of the complaint made\nabove.\nThere is, however, an alternative way of specifying a special-majority rule without\nprivileging any option. Remove the asymmetry. Under a Symmetrical Special-Majority\nrule, the same special majority of votes is required to install either option as the social\ndecision. If neither option has such a special majority, then no option is chosen. This rule\nis symmetrical in holding each option to the same standard; no option is ever installed by\ndefault. This article elaborates this version of special-majority voting, after first having\nmapped the logical space in which all (simple and special) versions of majority rule are\nsituated.\nFormally, the great difference between Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Special-\nMajority rules is this: if no option receives the requisite special majority, then under a\nSymmetrical rule no option is chosen, whereas under an Asymmetrical one the default\noption is chosen. This formal difference may matter materially. In Scotland, juries can\nreturn a verdict of \u2018convicted\u2019, \u2018acquitted\u2019 or \u2018case not proven\u2019; and between those last two\noptions there is a world of difference, the difference between full exoneration and lingering\nsuspicion.\nOf course, something always happens (or does not happen) as a result of any social\ndecision, including the decision under a Symmetrical Special-Majority rule that \u2018no option\nis chosen\u2019. In the case of the Scottish \u2018case not proven\u2019 verdict, the accused goes free, just\nas she would have done after a full-blown acquittal. Thus, it might be objected that there\nis no pragmatic difference between Symmetrical Special-Majority rules and Asymmetrical\nones. Some outcome is always, de facto, the default outcome that will obtain in the absence\nof a special majority for doing something else.\nBut that conclusion would be mistaken. One reason has already been noted. Under a\nSymmetrical Special-Majority rule that outcome\u2019s status is merely de facto, whereas an\nAsymmetrical rule anoints some default outcome as de jure \u2018socially chosen\u2019 in such\ncircumstances. And as noted, being set free de facto (because the case was \u2018not proven\u2019)\nis importantly different from being set free de jure (because you were acquitted).\nThere is another even more important reason why Symmetrical and Asymmetrical\nSpecial-Majority rules are different, explored at length below. Instead of specifying some\noption as the default outcome, as Asymmetrical Special-Majority rules do, Symmetrical\n12 Barry, Political Argument, p. 312.\n13 Or, more generally, if \u2018no other option\u2019 secures the requisite majority: but for simplicity we will confine our\ndiscussion here to the two-option case. The status quo is typically identified as the default option, but logically\nany option could be so designated. Specifying one option as the \u2018default\u2019 which wins (even if no one votes for\nit!), so long as no other option gets the requisite \u2018special majority\u2019, is just one case within the larger class of\nmajoritarian-type rules which hold different options to different (\u2018super\u2019, \u2018simple\u2019, or \u2018sub\u2019) \u2018majoritarian\u2019\nstandards. See Appendix I.\n216 G O O D I N A N D L I S T\nSpecial-Majority rules can be supplemented with some alternative decision procedure that\ncan be employed when no option receives the requisite special majority.14 Propositions\nthat are \u2018not decided\u2019 by Symmetrical Special-Majority voting in one forum can be shifted\nto some other forum for resolution: to the House of Representatives, for example, in the\ncase of a deadlock in Electoral College voting for the US president.\nThis suggestion is crucial in rescuing Symmetrical Special-Majority rules from the\ngreatest worry that might surround them. Whereas the bugbear of Asymmetrical\nSpecial-Majority rules is arbitrariness of the default option, the bugbear of Symmetrical\nSpecial-Majority rules is that they may leave too much open. Sometimes, of course, things\ncan be left open: no social decision is immediately required. But for those matters that\ncannot be left open, we propose that some supplementary mechanism can be used for\nsettling things that Symmetrical Special-Majority voting cannot. We discuss the problem\nof breaking ties in Section IV and sketch some proposals in Section V.\nWe precede those practical considerations with some formal ones on those two\nalternative forms of special-majority voting. Democratic decision procedures can, broadly,\nbe defended either on grounds of their procedural (fairness) merits or on grounds of their\nepistemic truth-tracking capacities or both.15 We analyse the formal characteristics of the\ntwo forms of special-majority voting, first from a procedural perspective (Section I) and\nthen from an epistemic one (Section II), comparing both forms of special-majority rule\nwith simple majority rule. The procedural standards are variations on those that Kenneth\nMay famously showed to characterize Simple-Majority Voting itself.16 The epistemic\nstandards are of a Bayesian sort, growing out of related work on the Condorcet Jury\nTheorem.17\nWe identify a \u2018trilemma\u2019, in both the procedural and epistemic realms. In each, there\nare three properties we might like a voting rule to display, but any given rule can display\nat most two of them at once.18 Our choice among voting rules \u2013 Simple-Majority rule,\nAsymmetrical Special-Majority rule or Symmetrical Special-Majority rule \u2013 depends on\nwhich of the three desiderata we are prepared to sacrifice. What is at stake in this choice\nis summarized in Section III.\nEach of the formal discussions in this article is preceded by an informal statement of\nthe issues involved. Furthermore, the formal discussions themselves are of a relatively\naccessible sort. Proofs appear in the appendices.\n14 This might not always work. We may sometimes have good grounds for thinking that some procedure or\nforum is the uniquely correct one for deciding a certain issue, and think it would be wrong to let any other decide\nit. Or the other procedure or forum might yield no determinate outcome either. Still, even if the procedure or\nforum-shifting trick will not always necessarily work to settle matters left undecided by a Symmetrical\nSpecial-Majority rule, it might nevertheless go some distance towards assuaging those concerns.\n15 Christian List and Robert E. Goodin, \u2018Epistemic Democracy: Generalizing the Condorcet Jury Theorem\u2019,\nJournal of Political Philosophy, 9 (2001), 276\u2013306.\n16 Kenneth O.

Our results, in contrast, show the impossibility of simultaneously satisfying\ncertain desiderata even in two-option choices.\nSpecial Majorities Rationalized 217\nI. PROCEDURAL PROPERTIES OF SIMPLE AND SPECIAL-MAJORITY RULES\nProcedurally, the great attraction of democratic decision rules is that they embody a regime\nof \u2018fair equality\u2019 among participants in making collective decisions.19 No individual is\nprivileged over any other. Moreover, under simple-majority voting \u2013 the paradigmatic\ndemocratic decision rule \u2013 no option is privileged over any other. An option is socially\nchosen or not, just depending on how many votes it gets, not on what option it is and not\non who voted for it.\nThese criteria of \u2018fair equality\u2019 have been formalized in the social choice literature.\nThere, May\u2019s Theorem \u2018is deservedly considered a minor classic\u2019.20 In a literature replete\nwith negative (impossibility) results, May\u2019s Theorem tells us what positively can be said\nin favour of Simple-Majority rule. It shows that Simple-Majority rule \u2013 and it alone among\nall decision procedures \u2013 simultaneously satisfies four conditions, each of which seems\nindependently desirable on democratic grounds.\nHere we assess both forms of special-majority rule against analogous conditions. To\nforeshadow our conclusions: both forms of special-majority rule require a relaxation of\none of those conditions, but different ones. Symmetrical Special-Majority rules relax the\nresponsiveness condition (permitting more ties), Asymmetrical ones the symmetry\ncondition. Which, if either, form of special-majority rule is attractive in a given context\ndepends on whether we have grounds in that context for relaxing the relevant condition.\nAn Informal Statement\nThe conditions which May shows to be uniquely satisfied by Simple-Majority rule are\nstated formally in the next section. We here describe them informally and suggest why they\nare democratically appealing. We consider a social decision problem with two options\n(e.g. two candidates, or the acceptance or rejection of some proposition).\nThe first condition, \u2018universal domain\u2019, stipulates that the voting rule renders a decision\n(where a tie is a decision, too) for every logically possible combination \u2013 or \u2018profile\u2019 \u2013 of\nvotes.21 This requirement is democratically compelling. A voting rule should be open to\nall possible combinations of votes that might be entered into it. If certain combinations of\nvotes were rejected as inadmissible, they would be effectively disenfranchised. For\ntechnical simplicity, we assume that no voter is indifferent between the two options, but\nthis assumption can in principle be relaxed.\nThe second condition, \u2018anonymity\u2019, stipulates that it does not matter who votes for\nwhat;22 all that matters is how many votes are cast for each option. The democratic appeal\nof this condition is obvious.\nJust as \u2018anonymity\u2019 requires that all voters be treated equally, so the third condition,\n\u2018symmetry\u2019, requires that all options be treated equally.23 Again, it seems a democratically\nappealing requirement that a given combination of votes for one option should yield the\n19 Charles R.

All other voting rules violate at least one condition.\nAll voting rules of a \u2018majoritarian type\u2019 considered here \u2013 simple and special ones alike\n\u2013 satisfy \u2018universal domain\u2019, \u2018anomyity\u2019 and \u2018monotonicity\u2019 (see Appendix I).\nAsymmetrical Special-Majority rules violate May\u2019s \u2018symmetry\u2019 condition, while\nSymmetrical Special-Majority rules satisfy that condition. To justify an Asymmetrical\nSpecial-Majority rule, therefore, we need some justification for the asymmetry (for the\n\u2018bias\u2019 in favour of the default option) \u2013 and also for the \u2018size\u2019 of that asymmetry (as reflected\nin the size of the special majority required for the other option to prevail).\nBy contrast, Symmetrical Special-Majority rules violate \u2018one-vote-responsiveness\u2019\n(they are responsive only to a change of enough votes to constitute a \u2018special majority\u2019),\nwhile Asymmetrical Special-Majority rules satisfy that condition. Of course, whatever\nreasons we have for requiring a \u2018special majority\u2019 to make a decision, those might also\nconstitute reasons for modifying the responsiveness requirement accordingly. Below we\ngeneralize the condition of \u2018one-vote-responsiveness\u2019 to that of \u2018k-votes-responsiveness\u2019,\nwhere k is the number of votes sufficient to break a tie. May\u2019s condition corresponds to\n24 Beitz, Political Equality, p. 59.\n25 Bruce Ackerman, Social Justice in the Liberal State (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1980),\np. 279, see also pp. 11\u201312, 44\u20135, 277\u201385. In 1951, \u2018The Case for Bare Majority Rule\u2019, Ethics, 62 (1951), 6\u201332,\nat p. 17, Neil Reimer makes a similar point when complaining that (implicitly, Asymmetrical) special-majority\nrules violate the \u2018egalitarian premise\u2019 central to democratic rule \u2018that each citizen \u2026 has the right to have his vote\nfor elected officials counted equally with others\u2019. Under an (Asymmetrical) special-majority rule, \u2018the views of\nthe individual members of the minority would be more heavily weighted than those of the individuals composing\nthe majority\u2019.\n26 May\u2019s original condition of \u2018positive responsiveness\u2019 is essentially the conjunction of these two conditions;\nit states that, starting from a situation in which the decision is either one of social indifference or one of acceptance\nof a proposition, if one vote changes in the direction of that proposition (i.e. away from opposing it or towards\nsupporting it, which is equivalent under our simplifying assumption that individual voters are not indifferent), then\nthe decision should become or remain one of acceptance of the proposition.\nSpecial Majorities Rationalized 219\nthe special case of k\u00011. While violating \u2018one-vote-responsiveness\u2019, Symmetrical\nSpecial-Majority rules satisfy the less demanding condition of \u2018k-votes-responsiveness\u2019\nfor a suitable k. This modification comes at the price of a proliferation of what we call\n\u2018non-trivial ties\u2019. Where no option receives the requisite \u2018special majority\u2019, a Symmetrical\nSpecial-Majority rule deems the decision to be a \u2018tie\u2019; and such ties may occur even if one\noption receives more votes than the other (just insufficiently many more).27\nBelow, we identify a \u2018trilemma\u2019. If we want to give all minorities above a certain size\na \u2018veto power\u2019 (which is what special-majority rules do), then we must sacrifice either the\ncondition of \u2018symmetry\u2019 or that of \u2018no non-trivial ties\u2019.28 We prove that a voting rule can\nsatisfy any two of those conditions \u2013 veto powers; symmetry; no non-trivial ties \u2013 but no\nvoting rule can satisfy all three. Simple-Majority rule satisfies the last two but forsakes the\nfirst (it allows no vetoes). Asymmetrical Special-Majority rules satisfy the first and last\nbut forsake the middle (they lack symmetry). Symmetrical Special-Majority rules satisfy\nthe first and second but forsake the last (they allow non-trivial ties).\nA Formal Statement: The Framework29\nWe suppose that n individuals have to make a collective decision over two options, for\nexample, the acceptance or rejection of some proposition, or two alternatives or candidates\nin an election. The individuals are labelled 1, 2, \u2026 , n, the options are labelled 1 and \u00051.\nThe vote of individual i is represented by vi (taking the values 1 or \u00051), where vi\u00011\nmeans that individual i votes for option 1, and vi\u0001 \u00051 means that individual i votes for\noption \u00051. For simplicity, we assume that no individual is indifferent between the two\noptions. A profile is a vector v \u0001 \u0006 v1, v2, \u2026 , vn\u0007of votes across the n individuals.\nA voting rule is a function f that maps each profile v in a given domain to an outcome\nf(v) (taking the values 1, 0 or \u00051), where:\nf(v)\u0001 1 means that 1 is collectively chosen (a positive decision);\nf(v)\u0001 \u00051 means that \u00051 is collectively chosen (a negative decision);\nf(v)\u0001 0 means that 1 and \u00051 are tied (a tie).\nThis allows the group to be indifferent between the two alternatives. To define several\nvoting rules formally, let us introduce some notation. Given a profile v, we write \u0002vi as\nan abbreviation for v1\u0002 v2\u0002\u2026\u0002 vn. Then \u0002vi is the absolute margin between the number\nof votes for 1 and the number of votes for \u00051, i.e. [number of 1s in v]\u0005 [number of \u00051s\nin v]. Now Simple-Majority rule can be defined as follows:\nSimple-Majority Rule. For any v,\n1 if \u0002vi\u00070\u23a7\u23a8f(v)\u0001 0 if \u0002vi\u00010\n\u00051 if \u0002vi\u00060\u23a9\n27 Note that this is not a failure to satisfy the \u2018universal domain\u2019. A \u2018tie\u2019 is still a decision. No profiles of votes\nare deemed inadmissible; for some profiles of votes, the two options simply stand in a relation of indifference\nto each another.\n28 We are here concerned with giving veto power to minorities generically, simply by virtue of their being a\nminority, rather than giving veto power to specific minority groups. Giving veto power to specific, identified groups\nwould involve a relaxation of the \u2018anonymity\u2019 condition. Giving veto power to minorities, generically, however,\nis consistent with \u2018anonymity\u2019, but requires the relaxation of either \u2018symmetry\u2019 or \u2018no non-trivial ties\u2019, as discussed\nhere.\n29 Proofs of the results in Section I are given in Appendix II.\n220 G O O D I N A N D L I S T\nExamples of less attractive voting rules are the following:\nDictatorship. For any v, f(v)\u0001 vi, where i is some antecedently fixed individual.\nImposed Acceptance. For any v, f(v)\u00011.\nImposed Rejection. For any v, f(v)\u0001 \u00051.\nImposed Indifference. For any v, f(v)\u00010.\nA procedural argument for a particular voting rule is an argument that this rule has\ncertain desirable procedural properties.\nThe Properties of Simple-Majority Rule\nMay\u2019s Theorem states that Simple-Majority rule is the unique voting rule that satisfies the\nfollowing conditions:\nUniversal domain (U). The domain of f is the set of all logically possible profiles.\nAnonymity (A). For any two profiles v and w, if v and w are permutations of each other,\nthen f(v)\u0001 f(w).\nSymmetry (S). For any profile v, f(\u0005 v)\u0001 \u0005 f(v).\nWe write v\bw if, for every i, vi\bwi. We write v\u0007w if v\bw and not v\u0001w.\nMonotonicity (M). For any two profiles v and w, v\bw implies f(v)\b f(w).\nOne-vote responsiveness (VR1). For any two profiles v and w, if f(w)\u00010 and v\u0007w, then\nf(v)\u00011.\nTheorem 1 (May\u2019s Theorem). A voting rule satisfies (U), (A), (S), (M) and (VR1) if and\nonly if it is Simple-Majority rule.\nTo the extent that the conditions of May\u2019s Theorem are desirable procedural properties,\nMay\u2019s Theorem provides a procedural argument for Simple-Majority rule. Let us briefly\nconsider the properties of Simple-Majority Voting.\n(1) Symmetry. As noted above, Simple-Majority rule satisfies condition (S). Swapping all\nvotes for 1 and \u00051 implies that the collective choice is swapped correspondingly.\n(2) Responsiveness, Ties and Tie-breaking. As noted above, Simple-Majority rule satisfies\ncondition (VR1). So Simple-Majority rule is very responsive to individual votes in the sense\nthat, given a tie between the two options, the change of even a single vote will break the\ntie in the direction of that change. As a result, Simple-Majority rule generates very few\nties. A voting rule f generates a tie for the profile v if f(v) \u0001 0. If a tie occurs where the\nnumber of votes for 1 equals that for \u00051, i.e. f(v)\u00010 and \u0002vi \u0001 0, we say that the tie\nis trivial. If a tie occurs although one option receives more votes than the other, i.e. f(v)\u00010\nand \u0002vi\t0, we say that the tie is non-trivial. Simple-Majority Voting does not generate\nany non-trivial ties:\nNo non-trivial ties (NT). For any profile v, f(v)\u00010 implies \u0002vi\u00010.\nIn fact, we can characterize Simple-Majority rule by replacing condition (VR1) in May\u2019s\nTheorem with condition (NT).\nCorollary of May\u2019s Theorem. A voting rule satisfies (U), (A), (S), (M) and (NT) if and only\nif it is Simple-Majority rule.\nSpecial Majorities Rationalized 221\n(3) Veto Powers. Under Simple-Majority rule, a group of n\/2 or more of the individuals\ncan veto a positive decision; and a group of n\/2 or more of the individuals can also veto\na negative decision. Formally, consider the following two conditions:\nVeto over positive decisions for a group of size k (PVk). For any profile v, if there are at\nleast k individuals i such that vi\u0001 \u00051, then f(v)\t1.\nVeto over negative decisions for a group of size k (NVk). For any profile v, if there are at\nleast k individuals i such that vi\u00011, then f(v)\t \u00051.\nSimple-Majority rule satisfies both (PVk) and (NVk) with k\u0001n\/2. But it does not\nsatisfy either condition for any integer k\u0006n\/2. So no minorities \u2013 groups of size less than\nn\/2 \u2013 have any veto powers under Simple-Majority Voting.\nThe Trilemma between Symmetry, No Non-trivial Ties and Minority Veto Powers\nWe have seen that Simple-Majority rule satisfies symmetry and no non-trivial ties, but it\ndoes not give any veto powers to minorities. Are there any other voting rules satisfying\nall of\n(1) symmetry,\n(2) no non-trivial ties,\n(3) giving certain veto powers to minorities?\nTheorem 2 (procedural trilemma). For any integer k\u0006n\/2, there exists no voting rule\nsatisfying (U), (S), (NT) and (PVk) (or (NVk)).\nWe are faced with a trilemma. No voting rule can satisfy all three of (1), (2) and (3),\nbut any two of (1), (2) and (3) can be simultaneously satisfied. Simple-Majority rule\nsatisfies (1) and (2) while violating (3). In fact, we have:\nProposition 1. A voting rule satisfies (U), (NT), (S) and (PVn\/2) (and (NVn\/2)) if and only\nif it is Simple-Majority rule.\nIf we want to ensure certain minority veto powers, we need to relax either (1) or (2).\nAsymmetrical Special-Majority rules satisfy (2) and (3) while violating (1). Symmetrical\nSpecial-Majority rules satisfy (1) and (3) while violating (2).\nAsymmetrical Special-Majority Rules\nIf we relax symmetry but do not permit non-trivial ties, not only is one alternative always\nprivileged over the other; the minority veto powers the special-majority rule grants are\nthen themselves also asymmetrical. There is always, in that case, a trade-off between\nminority veto powers over negative decisions and minority veto powers over positive\ndecisions.\nProposition 2. If a voting rule satisfies (U), (NT), (PVk1) and (NVk2), then k1\u0002 k2\bn.\nIf we give a minority of size k1\u0006n\/2 veto power over positive decisions, then at\nmost a supermajority of size greater than n\u0005 k1\u0007n\/2 has veto power over negative\n222 G O O D I N A N D L I S T\ndecisions, and vice versa. An Asymmetrical Special-Majority rule can be defined as\nfollows:\nAsymmetrical Special-Majority Rule with parameter m. For any v,\nf(v)\u0001\u0003 1\n\u00051\nif \u0002vi\bm\nif \u0002vi\u0006m (m\u0007n or m\u0006 \u0005n is admissible).\nIf m\u00070 (if n is even) or m \u00071 (if n is odd), the Asymmetrical Special-Majority rule\nis biased in favour of \u00051. In that case, a minority of size greater than (n\u0005m)\/2 can veto\na positive decision; but only a supermajority of size at least (n\u0002m)\/2 can veto a negative\ndecision. If m\n0 (if n is even) or m\n \u0005 1 (if n is odd), the rule is biased in favour of\n1. In that case, any minority of size greater than (n\u0002m\u00051)\/2 can veto a negative decision;\nbut only a supermajority of size at least (n\u0005m\u00021)\/2 can veto a positive decision.30\nProposition 3. An Asymmetrical Special-Majority rule with parameter m satisfies (PVk)\nif and only if k\u0007 (n\u0005m)\/2, and it satisfies (NVk) if and only if k\u0007 (n\u0002m\u00051)\/2.\nSymmetrical Special-Majority Rules\nIf we keep symmetry, but permit non-trivial ties, then it is the case not only that no\nalternative is privileged over the other, but also that the minority veto powers that the\nspecial majority rule grants are always symmetrical.\nProposition 4. Suppose a voting rule satisfies (U) and (S). Then, for any k, it satisfies (PVk)\nif and only if it satisfies (NVk).\nA Symmetrical Special-Majority rule can be defined as follows:\nSymmetrical Special-Majority Rule with parameter m (m\u00070). For any v,\n1 if \u0002vi\bm\u23a7\u23a8f(v)\u0001 0 if m\u0007\u0002vi\u0007 \u0005m\n\u00051 if \u0002vi\n \u0005m (m\u0007n is admissible).\u23a9\nThe limiting case m\u00011 corresponds to Simple-Majority rule. The condition \u0002vi\bm\nmeans that there is a special majority for 1 with a margin of at least m between the majority\nand the minority. The condition \u0002vi\n \u0005m means that there is a special majority for \u00051\nwith a margin of at least m between the majority and the minority. The condition\nm\u0007\u0002vi\u0007 \u0005m means that there is no sufficient special majority for either 1 or \u00051.\nThe class of symmetrical special majority rules can be fully characterized by May\u2019s\nconditions (U), (A), (S), (M), where condition (VR1) is relaxed.\nTheorem 3. A voting rule satisfies (U), (A), (S) and (M) if and only if it is a Symmetrical\nSpecial-Majority rule for some parameter m\u00070.\nTheorem 3 characterizes a whole class of voting rules. This class includes, for example,\nSimple-Majority rule (m\u00011), the Unanimity Rule (m\u0001n), the Imposed Indifference rule\n(m\u0007n). For a suitable choice of m\u00071, minorities have veto powers over both positive\nand negative decisions (recall Proposition 4 above).\n30 To make the special majority more demanding than a simple majority, we need to require [m\u00071 or m\n \u00051]\nif n is odd, and [m\u00072 or m\n \u00052] if n is even.\nSpecial Majorities Rationalized 223\nTo characterize not just the class of all Symmetrical Special-Majority rules, but specific\nsuch rules, we can use a minority veto condition to impose a lower bound on m, and a\ngeneralized responsiveness condition to impose an upper bound on m. A lower bound on\nm can be obtained as follows.\nProposition 5. A Symmetrical Special-Majority rule with parameter m satisfies (PVk)\n(and hence (NVk)) if and only if n\u00052k\u0006m.\nTo obtain an upper bound on m, we generalize the condition of one-vote responsiveness\nintroduced above (May\u2019s condition is the special case for k\u00011).\nk-Votes Responsiveness (VRk). For any two profiles v and w, if f(w)\u00010, v\bw, and there\nare at least k individuals i such that vi\u0007wi, then f(v)\u00011.\nA voting rule satisfies k-votes responsiveness if, in the case of a tie, the change of k\nvotes (all in the same direction, specifically from \u00051 to 1) will break the tie in the\ndirection of that change (also from \u00051 to 1). Now an upper bound on m can be obtained\nas follows.\nProposition 6. Let m be any integer greater than 0 (where m is even if n is even, and odd\nif n is odd). A Symmetrical Special-Majority rule with parameter m satisfies (VRk) if and\nonly if m\u0006 k\u00022.\nNow May\u2019s conditions (U), (A), (S), (M) together with Propositions 5 and 6 allow us\nto characterize Symmetrical Special-Majority rules for a specific range of parameters m.\nProposition 7. Let m be any integer greater than 0 (where m is even if n is even, and odd\nif n is odd). A voting rule satisfies (U), (A), (S), (M), (PVk1) and (VRk2) if and only if it\nis a Symmetrical Special-Majority rule with parameter m where n\u00052k1 \u0006m\u0006 k2\u00022.\nIf more than one value of m (where m is even if n is even, and odd if n is odd) satisfies\nn\u00052k1 \u0006m\u0006 k2\u00022, the conditions of Proposition 7 characterize a range of Symmetrical\nSpecial-Majority rules. If exactly one value of m satisfies the inequality, the conditions\ncharacterize a specific Symmetrical Special-Majority rule uniquely. If no value of m\nsatisfies the inequality \u2013 i.e. if k2\nn\u00052k1 \u2013 then the conditions of Proposition 7 cannot\nbe satisfied, i.e. we have an impossibility result. So the trade-off between minority\nveto powers and responsiveness under Symmetrical Special-Majority Voting is as\nfollows:\nProposition 8. If a Symmetrical Special-Majority rule satisfies both (PVk1) and (VRk2), then\nk2\u0007n\u00052k1.\nThe more responsive the voting rule (i.e. the smaller the value of k2 in \u2018k2-votes\nresponsiveness\u2019), the larger the group size k1 that is required for vetoing a (positive or\nnegative) decision. Condition (VR1) (where k2\u00011), as satisfied by Simple-Majority rule,\nimplies 1\u0001 k2\u0007n\u00052k1, i.e. k1\u0007n\/2\u20131\/2, and thus rules out minority veto powers.\nI I. EPISTEMIC PROPERTIES OF SIMPLE AND SPECIAL-MAJORITY RULES\nDemocratic procedures commend themselves not only on the grounds of procedural\nfairness, such as those formalized in May\u2019s Theorem. They also commend themselves on\nepistemic grounds, in terms of their truth-tracking power.\n224 G O O D I N A N D L I S T\nAristotle\u2019s loose talk of the \u2018wisdom of the multitude\u2019 was formalized in the Condorcet\nJury Theorem in the eighteenth century and has been intensively explored in recent years.31\nThe theorem shows that, if individuals cast their votes independently of one another and\neach voter is more than 0.5 likely to be correct in a two-option choice, the probability that\nthe majority vote is correct is an increasing function of the size of the electorate,\napproaching certainty as the number of individuals tends to infinity. Majority voting is,\nin that sense, a good truth-tracker.\nAn Informal Statement\nHere we explore a Bayesian version of the familiar Condorcet Jury model, to reveal an\nepistemic trilemma analogous to the procedural one above.32 The role of a \u2018minority veto\u2019\ncondition in the procedural case is taken by a \u2018no reasonable doubt\u2019 condition in the\nepistemic one. The issues discussed here arise in various circumstances, legal, medical and\nadministrative.33\nSometimes we want to make very certain we are right before acting. Members of a\ncriminal jury are asked to convict only if they are convinced \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019\nof the defendant\u2019s guilt: something like a 95 per cent probability that the defendant is guilty.\nIn civil trials, in contrast, the standard of proof is merely \u2018more likely than not\u2019: a\nprobability just over 50 per cent, either way, is sufficient for a decision.\nSometimes we think that the evidentiary burden ought to weigh disproportionately in\none direction. In the criminal jury case, while the prosecution has to prove its case beyond\na reasonable doubt, the defence does not. Other times, we think that the evidentiary burden\nought to be symmetrical, as in civil cases.\nSometimes, yet again, we think that the standard of proof should be \u2018no reasonable\ndoubt\u2019, but that that standard should apply symmetrically to both sides of the proposition.\nSuppose, for example, we are dealing with a drug that would, at worst, have only mildly\nunpleasant side-effects; and that, at best, would alleviate a condition which is only mildly\nunpleasant. There we might suppose: (1) the state should allow the sale of the drug under\nthe imprimatur of a \u2018licensed and approved therapeutic agent\u2019 only upon production of\nevidence that it is 90 per cent certain that the drug is safe and effective in alleviating the\ncondition; (2) the state should prohibit the sale of the drug only if it is 90 per cent certain\nthat it does more harm than good; and (3) the state should allow the drug to be sold over\nthe counter as a \u2018folk remedy\u2019, but without any official imprimatur, if neither of those\nconditions is met.\nThe form that the trilemma takes in the epistemic case is this. There are three properties\nwe might like to see in our epistemic decision procedure. One is \u2018symmetry\u2019 in the\nepistemic sense: positive decisions are held to the same standard of proof as negative ones.\nA second is an epistemic equivalent of \u2018no non-trivial ties\u2019 (ties occur only where the\nprobability of the truth of a proposition equals that of its negation). The third is a \u2018no\n31 Bernard Grofman, Guillermo Owen and Scott L.

Assuming independent voters each of whom is more likely to be right\nthan wrong, Simple-Majority rule meets the first and second conditions but not the third.\nSuitable Asymmetrical Special-Majority rules meet the second and third but not the first.\nSuitable Symmetrical Special-Majority rules meet the first and third but not the second.\nHere again, we sometimes have grounds for sacrificing one of those conditions. Which\nvoting rule we want to adopt, on epistemic grounds, follows from those reasons we have\nfor considering one or another condition more important, in any given situation.34\nA Formal Statement: The Framework35\nWe begin by stating Condorcet\u2019s classical model of jury decisions. We assume that there\nare two possible states of the world, represented by the variable X, which takes the value\n1 or \u00051. The two possible states of the world might be, respectively, the guilt or innocence\nof a defendant, or the truth or falsity of some factual proposition. Again, we assume that\nthere are n individuals, labelled 1, 2, \u2026 , n. The individuals are treated as diagnostic devices\nwhose votes are signals about the state of the world. The process by which each individual\ni generates his or her vote is represented by the random variable Vi, where Vi takes the value\n1 or \u00051. Let V denote the vector \u0006V1, V2, \u2026 , Vn\u0007of such random variables across the\nn individuals. For each individual i, a specific value of Vi \u2013 i.e. a specific vote of that\nindividual \u2013 is represented by vi. As before, a profile is a vector v \u0001 \u0006 v1, v2, \u2026 , vn\u0007of\nspecific such votes. Condorcet\u2019s model makes two assumptions, which we will tentatively\nretain throughout the following discussion and results.36\n34 As we have pointed out, the drawback of Symmetrical Special-Majority Voting, epistemically as well as\nprocedurally, is that it allows non-trivial ties. But in the epistemic case, non-trivial ties turn out to be less of a\nproblem. In a sufficiently large electorate, the probability of non-trivial ties under Symmetrical Special-Majority\nVoting can be proved to be vanishingly small. This follows from the fact that Symmetrical Special-Majority\nVoting, as defined here (in terms of a required absolute margin of votes between the majority and the minority)\nsatisfies the condition of truth-tracking in the limit: the probability of obtaining a special majority for 1 if X\u00011\nconverges to 1 as n increases; likewise, the probability of obtaining a special majority for \u00051 if X\u0001 \u00051 converges\nto 1 as n increases. See List, \u2018On the Significance of the Absolute Margin\u2019, and \u2018The Epistemology of Special\nMajority Voting\u2019.\n35 Proofs of the results in Section II are given in Appendix III.\n36 Many important modifications of Condorcet\u2019s model have been discussed in the literature. Cases where\ndifferent jurors have different competence levels \u2013 i.e. where the present homogeneous competence assumption\ndoes not hold \u2013 are discussed in Grofman, Owen and Feld, \u2018Thirteen Theorems in Search of the Truth\u2019; P.

Kanazawa, \u2018A\nBrief Note on a Further Refinement of the Condorcet Jury Theorem for Heterogeneous Groups\u2019, Mathematical\nSocial Sciences, 35 (1998), 69\u201373. Cases where there are certain dependencies between different jurors\u2019 votes\n\u2013 i.e. where the present independence assumption does not hold \u2013 are discussed in Krishna Ladha, \u2018The Condorcet\nJury Theorem, Free Speech and Correlated Votes\u2019, American Journal of Political Science, 36 (1992), 617\u201334;\nDavid Estlund, \u2018Opinion Leaders, Independence and Condorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem\u2019, Theory and Decision, 36 (1994),\n131\u201362; and Franz Dietrich and Christian List, \u2018A Model of Jury Decisions Where All Jurors Have the Same\nEvidence\u2019, Synthese, 142 (2004), 175\u2013202. Cases where jurors vote strategically rather than sincerely \u2013 i.e. where\njurors may not vote their private signals about the state of the world \u2013 are discussed in David Austen-Smith and\nJeff S. Banks, \u2018Information Aggregation, Rationality and the Condorcet Jury Theorem\u2019, American Political\nScience Review, 90 (1996), 34\u201345. But, for the purposes of this article, we tentatively use Condorcet\u2019s model in\nits simplest, classical form.\n226 G O O D I N A N D L I S T\nFirst, if the state of the world is 1, the individuals each have a greater than 1\/2\nchance of voting for 1; and if it is \u00051, they each have a greater than 1\/2 chance of voting\nfor \u00051.\nCompetence. For each individual i, Pr(Vi\u00011 \u0004X\u00011)\u0001Pr(Vi\u0001 \u00051 \u0004X\u0001 \u00051)\u0001p\u00071\/2,\nwhere p (the individual competence level) is the same for all individuals.\nThe probability Pr(Vi\u00011 \u0004X\u00011) (respectively Pr(Vi\u0001 \u00051 \u0004X\u0001 \u00051)) is the conditional\nprobability that individual i votes for 1 (respectively \u00051), given that the state of the world\nis 1 (respectively \u00051).\nSecondly, once the state of the world is given, the votes of different individuals are\nindependent from each other.\nIndependence. The votes of different individuals V1, V2, \u2026 , Vn are independent, given the\nstate of the world X.\nIn short, the votes of different individuals are independent identically distributed signals\nabout the state of the world, where each signal is noisy but biased towards the truth.\nThe key idea of an epistemic account of voting is that a particular voting pattern provides\nevidence about the state of the world, and that a good evaluation of that evidence \u2013 using\na suitable voting rule \u2013 allows a group to make decisions that track the state of the world\nreliably. An epistemic argument for a particular voting rule is an argument that a group\nusing this voting rule will be good at making decisions that track the state of the world\nreliably.\nThe Properties of Simple-Majority Rule\nLet us first address the properties of Simple-Majority rule from an epistemic perspective.\n(1) The standard of proof. Suppose we assign an equal prior probability of 1\/2 to each\nof the two states of the world, 1 and \u00051. This need not be an objective probability; in the\nabsence of more precise information, we might justify this equiprobability assumption by\nsome normative principle (\u2018no bias\u2019) or some methodological principle (Laplace\u2019s\n\u2018principle of insufficient reason\u2019). Condorcet\u2019s own presentation implicitly relied on this\nassumption.37 While the present exposition uses Bayesian notions and therefore requires\na prior probability assignment over the different states of the world, we present a classical\n(non-Bayesian) statistical variant of the present results in Appendix IV, which requires no\nassumption about prior probabilities at all.\nThe first thing to note is that, other things being equal, observing an individual vote\nfor 1 (respectively \u00051) should increase our degree of belief in the hypothesis that the\nstate of the world is 1 (respectively \u00051). Observing more such votes should increase\nour degree of belief in that hypothesis further. Whenever we observe a majority of votes\nfor 1, this should lead us to believe that X\u00011 is more likely to be true than X\u0001 \u00051.\nLikewise, whenever we observe a majority for \u00051, this should lead us to believe\nthat X\u0001 \u00051 is more likely to be true than X\u00011. In short, under Simple-Majority\nVoting, a positive decision is made if and only if X\u00011 is more likely to be true than\nX\u0001 \u00051; a negative decision is made if and only if X\u0001 \u00051 is more likely to be true\nthan X\u00011.\n37 List, \u2018On the Significance of the Absolute Margin\u2019.\nSpecial Majorities Rationalized 227\nHowever, in many situations, we require that a positive decision be made, not as soon\nas X\u00011 is more likely to be true than X\u0001 \u00051, but only if we believe, beyond any\nreasonable doubt, that X\u00011 is true. Consider the following two conditions:\nA standard of proof of c for positive decisions (PPc). For any profile v, f(v)\u00011 if and only\nif Pr(X\u00011 \u0004V\u0001 v)\u0007 c.\nA standard of proof of c for negative decisions (NPc). For any profile v, f(v)\u0001 \u00051 if and\nonly if Pr(X\u0001 \u00051 \u0004V\u0001 v) \u0007 c.\nThe probability Pr(X\u00011 \u0004V\u0001 v) (respectively Pr(X\u0001 \u00051 \u0004V\u0001 v)) is the conditional\nprobability that the state of the world is 1 (respectively \u00051), given that the pattern of votes\nacross the n individuals is precisely the profile v. The parameter c captures the requisite\nstandard of proof. The conditions require that a positive (respectively negative) decision\nbe made if and only if the conditional probability that X\u00011 (respectively X\u0001 \u00051), given\nthe voting pattern, exceeds the threshold c.\nAs we have noted, Simple-Majority rule satisfies (PPc) and (NPc) for c\u00011\/2.\nBut Simple-Majority rule does not satisfy either (PPc) and (NPc) for any value of c\nsignificantly greater than 1\/2. We say, in a technical sense, that c is significantly greater\nthan 1\/2 if\nc\b\u0003 pp2\/(p2\u0002 (1\u0005p)2)) if n is oddif n is even.\nIntuitively, only a value of c close enough to 1 and thus typically significantly greater than\n1\/2 \u2013 say c\u00010.95 \u2013 will capture the requirement of \u2018no reasonable doubt\u2019. So\nSimple-Majority Voting is an unsuitable voting rule if we demand a threshold of \u2018no\nreasonable doubt\u2019 that is significantly greater than 1\/2.\n(2) Symmetry. In the procedural case, we defined symmetry as the requirement that\nswapping all votes for 1 and \u00051 implies that the outcome of the aggregation is swapped\ncorrespondingly. But symmetry can also be defined in epistemic terms, namely as the\nrequirement that the standard of proof for positive decisions should be exactly the same\nas that for negative decisions; in other words, that a voting rule should satisfy (PPc) for\nsome value of c if and only if it satisfies (NPc) for the same value of c. Under Condorcet\u2019s\nassumptions \u2013 including, crucially, the assignment of an equal prior probability to the two\nstates of the world38\u2013 Simple-Majority Voting satisfies symmetry in this sense.\n(3) Ties. We have seen that Simple-Majority Voting rules out non-trivial ties in a\nprocedural sense: it allows ties only when the number of individuals voting for 1 equals\nthe number of individuals voting for \u0005 1. There is also an epistemic sense in which\nSimple-Majority Voting rules out non-trivial ties. If f(v)\u00010 and Pr(X\u00011 \u0004V\u0001 v)\u00011\/2,\nwe say that the tie is trivial. In that case, the tie occurs in a situation where we consider\nthe two possible states of the world equally probable. If f(v)\u00010 and Pr(X\u00011 \u0004V\u0001 v)\t1\/\n2, by contrast, we say that the tie is non-trivial. In that case, there is a tie although we\nconsider one of the two possible states of the world\n38 Again, the assumption is not needed in the classical (non-Bayesian) version of the argument in\nAppendix IV.\n228 G O O D I N A N D L I S T\nmore probable than the other. Simple-Majority Voting does not allow any non-trivial ties\nin this epistemic sense. It satisfies:39\nNo non-trivial ties (NT*). For any profile v, f(v)\u00010 implies Pr(X\u00011 \u0004V\u0001 v)\u0001\nPr(X\u0001 \u00051 \u0004V\u0001 v)\u00011\/2.\nThe Trilemma Between Symmetry, No Non-trivial Ties and No Reasonable Doubt\nWe have seen that Simple-Majority Voting satisfies both symmetry and no non-trivial ties\nin the epistemic sense, but it cannot implement a threshold of \u2018no reasonable doubt\u2019\nsignificantly greater than 1\/2 for either positive or negative decisions. In analogy with the\nprocedural case, we may ask whether there are any other voting rules satisfying all the\nfollowing:\n(1) symmetry in the epistemic sense,\n(2) no non-trivial ties in the epistemic sense,\n(3) no reasonable doubt.\nThe following result gives a negative answer to this question.\nTheorem 4. For any standard of proof parameter c significantly greater than 1\/2, there exists\nno voting rule satisfying (U), (NT*), (PPc) and (NPc).\nAgain, we are faced with a trilemma. No voting rule can satisfy all three of (1), (2) and\n(3), but any two of (1), (2) and (3) are satisfiable. Simple-Majority Voting satisfies (1) and\n(2) while violating (3). In fact, Simple-Majority Voting is the unique voting rule satisfying\n(PP1\/2) and (NP1\/2) together with universal domain:\nProposition 9. In Condorcet\u2019s model, a voting rule satisfies (U), (PP1\/2) and (NP1\/2) if and\nonly if it is Simple-Majority Voting.\nIf we want to ensure a standard of proof significantly greater than 1\/2 \u2013 e.g. a threshold\nof \u2018no reasonable doubt\u2019 \u2013 we need to relax either (1) or (2). An Asymmetrical\nSpecial-Majority rule satisfies (2) and (3) while violating (1). A Symmetrical Special-\nMajority rule satisfies (1) and (3) while violating (2).\nAsymmetrical Special-Majority rules. If we relax symmetry but do not permit non-trivial\nties, we are faced with a trade-off between standards of proof for positive and negative\ndecisions.\nProposition 10. Suppose a voting rule satisfies (U) and (NT*), and suppose c1 is\nsignificantly greater than 1\/2. If the voting rule satisfies (PPc1), then it does not satisfy\n(NPc2) for any c2\b1\/2; and if it satisfies (NPc1), then it does not satisfy (PPc2) for any\nc2\b1\/2.\nIf we demand a standard of proof for positive decisions that is significantly greater than\n1\/2, then we cannot also demand a standard of proof for negative decisions that is greater\nthan or equal to 1\/2. Likewise, if we demand a standard of proof for negative decisions\nthat is significantly greater than 1\/2, then we cannot also demand a standard of proof for\nnegative decisions that is greater than or equal to 1\/2.\n39 Assuming an equal prior probability of the two states of the world \u2013 this assumption is not needed in the\nclassical (non-Bayesian) version of the argument in Appendix IV.\nSpecial Majorities Rationalized 229\nIn jury decisions this seems acceptable, as the standard of proof for conviction should\nbe higher than that for acquittal. But in other decision problems, where there is no\nantecedently privileged alternative, we may require a symmetrical standard of proof.\nAnd if we require not only a standard of proof that is symmetrical, but also one that\nis significantly greater than 1\/2, then we are led to a Symmetrical Special-Majority\nrule.40\nSymmetrical Special-Majority Rules\nWe can now provide a characterization result on Symmetrical Special-Majority rules. If\nwe permit non-trivial ties in the epistemic sense, then Symmetrical Special-Majority rules\nare the unique voting rules satisfying universal domain and a symmetrical standard of\nproof. When the required standard of proof c and the individual competence parameter of\np are given, the parameter m of the corresponding Symmetrical Special-Majority rule can\nbe determined by the expression log(1\/c\u00051)\/log(1\/p\u00051).\nProposition 11. Let c\b1\/2. A voting rule satisfies (U), (PPc) and (NPc) if and only if it\nis a Symmetrical Special-Majority rule, where the parameter m is the smallest integer\nstrictly greater than log(1\/c\u00051)\/log(1\/p\u00051).\nThe case c\u00011\/2 corresponds to Simple-Majority rule. The case c significantly greater\nthan 1\/2 but less than pn\/(pn\u0002 (1\u0005p)n)) corresponds to a Special-Majority (up to\nUnanimity) rule. The case c greater than or equal to pn\/(pn\u0002 (1\u0005p)n)) corresponds to\nImposed Indifference.\nI I I. CHOOSING AMONG DECISION RULES\nFigure 1 summarizes the parallel trilemmas identified in Sections I\u2013II. The nodes of the\ntriangle represent three conditions that we might like a voting rule to satisfy, but only two\nFig. 1. The trilemmas\n40 Once again, it is important to note the assumption of an equal prior probability of both states of the world.\nIf that assumption is given up, then, in a Bayesian framework, a symmetrical standard of proof may lead to (and\ntherefore justify) an asymmetrical Special-Majority rule. In the classical framework in Appendix IV, by contrast,\nno assumption about prior probabilities is needed to justify a Symmetrical Special-Majority rule on the basis of\na symmetrical standard of proof requirement.\n230 G O O D I N A N D L I S T\nof which can be simultaneously satisfied. Each side of the triangle, connecting two nodes,\nrepresents the type of voting rule that satisfies those two conditions (whilst violating the\ncondition at the opposite node). The trilemmas in Figure 1 help us see what is at stake in\nthe choice among alternative voting rules. The decision tree in Figure 2 summarizes that\nchoice.\nFig. 2. Grounds for choosing among decision rules\nProcedurally, the great disadvantage of Simple-Majority rule is the risk of majority\ntyranny. Under Simple-Majority rule, the majority might ride roughshod over the interests\nof \u2018discrete and insular\u2019 minorities that have distinctive interests but only a minority of\nthe votes. We may wish to protect such minorities by requiring that decisions affecting\nthem be taken by \u2018special majorities\u2019 sufficiently large to, in effect, give such minorities\nveto power.\nOften, of course, there is no such problem. There may be no real risk of any group being\nso discrete and insular as to be in danger of being tyrannized by a majority. Then\nSimple-Majority rule is satisfactory. Indeed, in the limiting case where there are absolutely\nno factions (every pair of voters is as likely to vote with one another as against one another),\nSimple-Majority rule is the voting rule that uniquely maximizes each voter\u2019s probability\nof being on the winning side of an election.41\nThus, Simple-Majority rule works fine where there are no factions or any other reasons\nto grant submajorities veto power over the social outcome. But where there is a genuine\nrisk of sufficiently cohesive submajorities with sufficiently strong and distinctive interests,\nwe may want to give them extra power over the outcome. Under certain special conditions,\n41 Douglas W. Rae, \u2018Decision-Rules and Individual Values in Constitutional Choice\u2019, American Political\nScience Review, 63 (1969), 40\u201356; Michael Taylor, \u2018Proof of a Theorem on Majority Rule\u2019, Behavioral Science,\n14 (1969), 228\u201331; Mueller, Public Choice III, pp. 136\u20137.\nSpecial Majorities Rationalized 231\nSimple-Majority rule might itself provide them with that (if, for example, the groups in\nquestion are pivotal in coalition or majority-cycling situations).42 But giving submajorities\nanything like a strong veto power requires us to abandon Simple-Majority rule in favour\nof some form of special-majority voting.\nEpistemically, likewise, Simple-Majority rule is ideal so long as we merely want to\nidentify propositions that are \u2018more likely than not\u2019 to be true. But if we require greater\nconfidence, we need some form of special-majority voting.43\nThe great disadvantage of ordinary Asymmetrical Special-Majority rules is precisely\ntheir asymmetry. They privilege one option as the \u2018default\u2019 one that prevails if the other\noption does not receive the requisite \u2018special majority\u2019.\nAgain, sometimes that is not a problem. There may be good grounds for privileging one\noption in that way. There are good grounds for a presumption of innocence in criminal\ntrials, and for making it harder to convict than to acquit. There are good grounds for\nrequiring a larger legislative majority to overturn a president\u2019s veto than was required to\npass the bill in the first place, in order for a mixed constitution to provide genuine checks\nand balances.\nThus, there exist cases in which the asymmetries built into Asymmetrical Special-\nMajority rules are not arbitrary. But the burden must be on advocates of the differential\ntreatment of the various options to provide a justification for the asymmetry.\nSymmetrical Special-Majority rules solve that problem by treating all options\nsymmetrically. They require the same \u2018special majority\u2019 for either option in order for it\nto be chosen. The great disadvantage of a Symmetrical Special-Majority rule is that it may\ngenerate many \u2018non-trivial ties\u2019. It chooses neither option as the social decision if neither\nachieves the requisite majority \u2013 even if one option got more votes than the other.\nSometimes this might not be a problem. Sometimes it does no harm to leave the matter\nunsettled. But in general, we put something to a vote only when we genuinely need to have\nthe issue resolved; and hence a voting rule that leaves too many things unsettled seems\nproblematic. It is to that problem that we now turn.\nIV. BREAKING TIES\nThe problem with leaving things formally unsettled is that, as we have long been aware,\n\u2018non-decisions\u2019 are decisions too.44 Something will happen, or not happen, in consequence\n42 In a spatial voting framework, McCann argues that simple-majority rule protects worst-off minorities better\nthan other (e.g., supermajority) rules. His argument rests on the claim that the instability (cycling) inherent in the\nsimple-majority rule allows minorities to overturn dispreferred outcomes by entering into appropriate coalitions.\nThis is an interesting argument, identifying a potentially desirable implication of the often criticized instability\nof simple-majority rule. See A. J. McCann, \u2018The Tyranny of Supermajorities\u2019, Journal of Theoretical Politics,\n16 (2004), 53\u201377.\n43 There are also arguments for supermajority rules as a means of inducing greater revelation of information\nand encouraging the participation of those who might otherwise opt out of the process. See Hao Li, \u2018A Theory\nof Conservatism\u2019, Journal of Political Economy, 109 (2001), 617\u201336; and Michael Suk-Young Chwe, \u2018Minority\nVoting Rights Can Maximize Majority Welfare\u2019, American Political Science Review, 93 (1999), 85\u201397.\n44 See Peter Bachrach and Morton S. Baratz, \u2018Decisions and Non-decisions: An Analytic Framework\u2019,\nAmerican Political Science Review, 57 (1963), 632\u201342. Sunstein uses the phrase to refer to something slightly\ndifferent: leaving the \u2018grounds\u2019 for a judicial decision open, as judges content themselves with simply rendering\na decision in the case at hand (with each judge deciding the case on different grounds, perhaps). See Cass\nR.Sunstein, \u2018Leaving Things Undecided\u2019, Harvard Law Review, 110 (1996), 4\u2013101.\n232 G O O D I N A N D L I S T\nof things being left undecided; some interests will be well served, and others ill served.45\nLeaving things undecided is not without consequences.46\nSo it is genuinely a problem that Symmetrical Special-Majority rules may leave things\nundecided. Notice, however, that most decision rules \u2013 including Simple-Majority rule\nwith an even number of voters \u2013 have to face the problem of what to do in the case of tied\nvotes.47 Ties may occur more frequently under Symmetrical Special-Majority rules, but\nthe problem is in no way unique to them. Examining how that problem is handled in\nconnection with other voting rules gives us some hints as to how we might solve that\nproblem with respect to Symmetrical Special-Majority rules.\nGenerically, there are three ways of resolving ties. Either: (1) we can privilege one of\nthe options; or (2) we can privilege one of the voters; or (3) we can settle issues on which\nthere are ties by some wholly separate procedure.\nCursory inspection of actual decision procedures reveals many examples of (1). The\nmost familiar is the rule that \u2018the status quo remains in force unless some alternative to\nit is enacted\u2019.\nThere are not many cases of (2). One example rather like that might be the practice of\nthe Speaker of the US House of Representatives casting the deciding vote in cases of a\ntie. But even that is not a completely clean case of (2). It is not as if the Speaker has a \u2018golden\nvote\u2019. Rather (by convention) the Speaker only votes when his vote is \u2018golden\u2019, i.e., in cases\nof a tie when his vote will indeed decide the matter.48\nMore interesting from our point of view are examples of (3). Note in this connection\nthe procedure set down in the original text of Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution\nfor choosing the president:\nThe person having the greatest number of votes [in the Electoral College] shall be the President,\nif such a number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed; and if there be more\n45 For a dramatic example, reflect upon this tale from the Ukraine relayed by John Dryzek and Leslie Holmes,\nPostcommunist Democratization (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), p. 117, emphasis added.\n\u2018Parliamentary elections were \u2026 held in 1994, contested by a large number of parties, many of which were\nconcentrated in particular regions. The elections were conducted under the requirement that, to be elected, a\ncandidate had to secure the support of over 50 percent of registered voters, either in the first round or in a runoff\nbetween the top two candidates in a constituency. The results were hardly conclusive. [Low turnout meant that\nm]any constituencies could not elect a representative under this system \u2026\u2019 Such non-election inevitably favours\none side or another. In the Ukraine, it in effect favoured the Communist Party and the old nomenklatura. They\nwon, not exactly by default, but nonetheless precisely because other seats went unfilled.\n46 In the purple prose of Rae\u2019s \u2018Limits of Consensual Decision\u2019, p. 1279 (formatting altered): \u2018It is shallow at\nbest to imagine that \u2026 legal choices can be put off: to \u201cnot decide\u201d must imply one of two outcomes: (a) tacit\npermission \u2026 or (b) continuance of an explicit status quo mandate, prohibition or permission.\nTo see the point\u2019s obviousness try to devise a way of effectively postponing a decision on the legality of abortion\nwhich can be explained to a pregnant woman. In the choice of candidates for office, either someone is elected\nor nobody is (yet) elected at any given moment: a final choice can be put off only by accepting an interval of\nindeterminacy or \u2018provisional\u2019 control which is a very real outcome (consider the Greek colonels or the Portuguese\nCommunists). International agreements can be put off, but a very real and often painful status quo remains to be\nexperienced. These cases suggest a ubiquitous forcing of choice: even when explicit outcomes can be postponed,\ntacit ones are ipso facto chosen.\u2019\n47 It may seem that under Simple Majority rule ties will be rare and trivial. And so they are, at least in the\ntechnical sense introduced above. Although it may make no democratic difference how the issue is decided when\nthere are equal numbers on both sides, it may nonetheless matter enormously to each side how the tied vote is\nresolved. In that sense, how we resolve ties might be anything but trivial, even under Simple-Majority rule.\n48 The Speaker\u2019s case is interestingly different from that of the President of the Senate (the vice-president of\nthe United States), whom the US Constitution (Article I, Section 3) stipulates \u2018shall have no vote, unless they be\nequally divided\u2019.\nSpecial Majorities Rationalized 233\nthan one who have such majority, and have an equal number of votes, then the House of\nRepresentatives shall immediately chuse by ballot one of them for President \u202649\nThe details of those arcane arrangements matter less than their structure, for present\npurposes. The structure of the decision rule is this: in case of a tie, decide the issue through\nsome other procedure altogether.\nV. TIE-BREAKERS UNDER SYMMETRICAL SPECIAL-MAJORITY RULES\nHere we explore two possible variations on that \u2018other procedure\u2019 strategy for breaking\nthe ties generated by Symmetrical Special-Majority rules. The first, which can be used only\nin very special circumstances, would be for authorities (perhaps most naturally \u2018judicial\nauthorities\u2019) to decide matters that voting has left formally undecided, by extrapolating\nfurther decisions from ones that have already been made under a suitable Symmetrical\nSpecial-Majority rule. The second mechanism, which can be used in any federal system,\nis to let lower levels of government settle issues that are left open by Symmetrical\nSpecial-Majority voting at the higher level.50\nJudicial Extrapolation\nSuppose the legislature has ruled authoritatively on certain propositions, and indeed done\nso by some very large majority. Suppose, however, it has left certain other matters\nundecided, and we require some resolution of those issues. Under certain special\ncircumstances, it might be permissible for some authoritative agent (perhaps most naturally\njudicial authorities) to extrapolate from what has been agreed to by those legislative\n\u2018special majorities\u2019 to other propositions that are implied by what has been agreed, treating\nthose \u2018implied\u2019 propositions as having the same status as those that had actually been\nagreed to.\nOne common principle of extrapolation along these lines, for example, is that \u2018those who\nintend an end intend the means strictly necessary to attain that end\u2019. So a legislature that\nhas enacted a statute that assigns powers and responsibilities to the \u2018Bureau of the Census\u2019\nwill be construed as having endorsed the existence of such a bureau, even if the legislature\nneglected to stipulate that in the statute itself.\nOne of the worries surrounding such \u2018judicial legislation\u2019 in general is that the judges\nmight well make laws that are contrary to ones the legislature itself would have enacted.\nIn ordinary circumstances, that is a genuine worry. It is particularly worrisome wherever\ndecisions involving multiple connected propositions are made by Simple-Majority rule.51\n49 Before the Twelfth Amendment, electors cast ballots in this way for two persons, and the person with most\nvotes became president and the person with the next-most votes vice-president. Thus, it was logically possible\nfor two candidates both to be supported by a majority of electors.\n50 We might or might not require that decisions in those other venues be made by the same Symmetrical\nSpecial-Majority rules as well. That is not necessary to derive the results discussed below with respect to judicial\nextrapolation. Under federal subsidiarity rules, it might be the case that the same procedural or epistemic\nconsiderations that lead us to demand a special majority of a specific size at the higher level would also apply\nequally to decision-making at the lower levels; but there might be some reason for thinking that there is something\nspecial about the units (member states) doing the voting at the higher level that makes us want to protect minorities\namong them, in a way that we might not at lower levels where the units (localities) doing the voting enjoy no such\nmorally special status.\n51 Christian List and Philip Pettit, \u2018Aggregating Sets of Judgments: An Impossibility Result\u2019, Economics and\nPhilosophy, 18 (2002), 89\u2013110, and \u2018Aggregating Sets of Judgments: Two Impossibility Results Compared\u2019,\nSynthese, 140 (2004), 207\u201335.\n234 G O O D I N A N D L I S T\nTo illustrate, imagine three decision makers who each have a certain set of views over\nthree propositions: P; \u2018P implies Q\u2019; and Q. The first believes that P is true, that P implies\nQ, and therefore that Q is also true. The second believes that P is true, but does not believe\nthat P implies Q, so is consistent in also believing that Q is false. The third accepts that\nP implies Q but believes that P and Q are both false. Suppose these individuals vote on\neach of these propositions. A majority (two out of three) hold that P is true; a majority (two\nout of three) hold that P implies Q; and yet a majority (two out of three) hold that Q is\nfalse. Were the judiciary to extrapolate from the majority acceptance of P and \u2018P implies\nQ\u2019 that Q should also be law, this would be opposite to what a majority vote on Q would\nhave yielded.\nSymmetrical Special-Majority voting can assuage those worries. For that to be the case,\nthe \u2018special majority\u2019 supporting each of the component propositions needs to be high: it\nmust be more than (s\u00051)\/s of the individuals, where s is the number of distinct\npropositions on which decisions are to be made (including basic propositions like P and\nQ and propositions connecting them like \u2018P implies Q\u2019). It can be proven that, if\npropositions (basic and connecting ones) are accepted only if they command a special\nmajority of that size, then there will not be a similarly large special majority against any\ninferences drawn from the combination of accepted propositions.52\nThus, judges can draw, and impose as law, the logical implications of the laws that the\nlegislature has passed by \u2018special majorities\u2019 of the requisite size. (Note well, those\nimplications must be derived by rules of inference that the legislators themselves do \u2013 or\npresumably would \u2013 agree to, by a similar-sized \u2018special majority\u2019.) Judges can do that,\nconfident that their verdicts will not be contrary to the will of any similarly large special\nmajority among the legislature.53\n52 The theorem can be stated as follows. Suppose there are s propositions to be voted on (counting each\nproposition\u2013negation pair as one proposition), and each individual has a consistent set of views over these\npropositions. Then proposition-wise (symmetrical) supermajority voting with a supermajority size of more than\n(s\u00051)\/s of the individuals generates a consistent (but not necessarily complete and deductively closed) collective\nset of views over the propositions. For a more technical exposition and a proof, see theorem 7 in Christian List,\n\u2018A Model of Path-Dependence in Decisions over Multiple Propositions\u2019, American Political Science Review, 98\n(2004), 495\u2013513. The result has recently been refined by Franz Dietrich and Christian List, \u2018Judgment Aggregation\nby Quota Rules\u2019, working paper, London School of Economics, http:\/\/personal.lse.ac.uk\/LIST\/PDF-files\/\nQuotaRules.pdf (accessed 24 January 2004). Proposition-wise (symmetrical) supermajority voting also has an\nimportant property in sequential decisions over multiple connected propositions, where (i) different propositions\nare considered one after the other, (ii) each proposition is decided by some voting rule, but (iii) earlier decisions\nconstrain later ones. If the voting rule is simple-majority voting, then such decision processes may be\npath-dependent: their outcome may depend on the order in which the propositions are considered. By contrast,\nif the voting rule is (symmetrical) supermajority voting with a supermajority requirement of more than (s\u00051)\/s\nof the individuals, then such path-dependence can be avoided. See List, \u2018A Model of Path-Dependence\u2019, and\nDietrich and List, \u2018Judgment Aggregation by Quota Rules\u2019.\n52 So long as m (the legislature\u2019s own Symmetrical Special-Majority requirement between the majority and the\nminority) is similarly large, specifically m\u0007n(2(s\u00051\/s)\u00051). To illustrate, if the number of propositions is s\u00013,\nthen (s\u00051)\/s\u00012\/3, and so in a 100-member legislature m must be at least 34, corresponding to a majority of at\nleast 67 out of 100.\n53 Remember the context, here. Judicial extrapolation is being offered as a way of \u2018breaking ties\u2019, filling in\nmatters that are left open by Symmetrical Special-Majority voting in the legislative forum. The scenario in view\nis one in which the legislature is operating under the rule that \u2018a special majority of members is required to decide\nfor or against any proposition\u2019; anything less, and the outcome would be considered a \u2018tie\u2019 and left open,\nlegislatively. Judicial extrapolation in those circumstances would therefore not fall foul of the will of the\nlegislature, operating under the rules here in view.\nSpecial Majorities Rationalized 235\nOf course, the requisite \u2018special majority\u2019 \u2013 (s\u00051)\/s \u2013 increases with the number of\npropositions (s) involved in the inference. If there are three propositions involved in the\ninference (including propositions connecting other propositions), those propositions\nwould each have to be endorsed by more than 2\/3 of the legislature (or judges have to think\nthey would be so endorsed); if there are four, each by more than 3\/4; if eight, each by more\nthan 7\/8. Hence this is a mechanism that can plausibly be employed only where the\ninferences are fairly simple and straightforward, involving few steps. Otherwise the special\nmajority requirement approaches unanimity.\nStill, there are such cases. Consider the principle, mentioned above, that \u2018endorsing the\nends implies endorsing the necessary means\u2019. In terms of our three-proposition example\nabove: P is the end; \u2018P implies Q\u2019 is the proposition that \u2018if P is the end then Q is a necessary\nmeans to that end\u2019; and so Q is the means in question. Since we have three propositions,\nany special majority requirement of more than 2\/3 of the individuals would be sufficient.\nFederal Subsidiarity\nA second mechanism for resolving ties generated by Symmetrical Special-Majority voting\ncan be found in the division of decisional responsibilities within a federal system.\nTo help motivate our proposal here, consider a familiar aspect of appellate court practice.\nIn courts of appeal, it is standard for the judgment of the lower court to be allowed to stand,\nif the higher court splits evenly on the appeal.\nBarry and Hardin discuss that practice and describe it as a violation of May\u2019s \u2018neutrality\u2019\ncondition.54 Certainly that rule privileges one outcome over the other: whichever outcome\nwas the one chosen by the lower court. But the \u2018whichever\u2019 in that last sentence is crucial.\nIt is not any particular outcome that is privileged by this rule, as the \u2018default option\u2019 is in\nthe Asymmetrical Special-Majority rule. Instead, what is privileged is a particular decision\nmaker \u2013 the lower court. Furthermore, the decision maker thus privileged is not one of the\nparticipants in the appeals court (not the senior judge of the panel, for example), which\nwould violate the \u2018anonymity\u2019 condition. What is actually privileged by this rule is a wholly\nseparate decision process, to be used for making the decision when this process yields no\ndeterminate choice: when the higher court is tied, the decision of the lower court stands.\nOf course, that particular rule actually operates only for the very special case of a literally\n\u2018tied\u2019 verdict in an appeals court that operates according to Simple-Majority rule. But we\npropose that model, suitably generalized, as a good strategy for solving the much more\nfrequent \u2018ties\u2019 that can be expected under Symmetrical Special-Majority voting.\nThe generalized version of this rule, as applied to a federal system (like the European\nUnion, for example), might be this. The higher-level authority can be empowered to act\nonly on the basis of a \u2018special majority\u2019 of the requisite size. There is no \u2018default\u2019 option\nthat wins if no other option commands that number of votes; if no option commands the\nrequisite \u2018special majority\u2019, the higher-level authority has simply not decided in favour of\nany option. From the point of view of the higher-level authority, it remains a completely\nopen question. But in the context of a federal system operating under a rule of \u2018subsidiarity\u2019\nsuch irresolution at the higher level of authority can simply leave the matter open to\ndetermination by authorities at the lower levels.\nDeterminations of higher-level authorities can still pre-empt determinations of\nlower-level ones. But where the higher-level authority makes no determinations \u2013 here,\n54 Barry and Hardin, Rational Man and Irrational Society? p. 297.\n236 G O O D I N A N D L I S T\nwhere there is no \u2018special majority\u2019 of the requisite size in favour of any option, at the higher\nlevel \u2013 the higher-level authority has not pre-empted any decisions by lower-\nlevel authorities. Under the doctrine of \u2018subsidiarity\u2019, the issue then falls to lower-level\nauthorities (member states, local communities, private individuals) to resolve.\nSuch strategies resonate particularly powerfully in the EU context, because of its strong\ntraditions of subsidiarity.55 But they are common enough even where the central authorities\nare stronger. The US federal government often intentionally leaves matters that are\nformally within its jurisdiction open to determination on a state-by-state basis, hoping that\nthe \u2018laboratory of federalism\u2019 might throw up better solutions than any of the federal\nlegislators or bureaucrats can think of for now. The US welfare reforms of 1996 explicitly\ninvited different states to come up with different rules for governing Temporary Assistance\nto Needy Families, for example. And in its refusal either to endorse a right to\nphysician-assisted suicide or to prohibit it, the US Supreme Court left the matter open for\nresolution on a state-by-state basis.56\nOf course, something gets decided, somewhere. Some people win, others lose, in\nconsequence of those decisions. Leaving things undecided at one level just shifts the\neffective decision point elsewhere.\nThe point remains, however, that the decision is at least a decision, rather than just the\nautomatic consequence of some arbitrary \u2018default\u2019. There are reasons for the decision,\nwhich people can discuss and debate in those other fora. An Asymmetrical Special-\nMajority rule, in contrast, would simply impose some outcome merely by default.\nIn the course of breaking the \u2018ties\u2019 left by the Symmetrical Special-Majority rule at the\nhigher level, lower-level jurisdictions will often choose different options one from another.\nIndeed, often they already have.\nSuch situations pose a compelling case for employing a Symmetrical Special-Majority\nrule. If different lower-level jurisdictions have already chosen different options, then to\nlet any one of those options serve as the \u2018default option\u2019 under an Asymmetrical\nSpecial-Majority rule would arbitrarily favour some jurisdictions and their choices over\nothers. There may well be good grounds for thinking that the higher-level jurisdiction needs\nto have a \u2018special majority\u2019 of some sort or another to overrule the determinations of the\nlower-level jurisdictions, in a regime like the EU. But if so, it surely ought to be\na Symmetrical Special-Majority requirement that treats all jurisdictions and all\noptions identically. And if the requisite \u2018special majority\u2019 cannot be attained by any of the\noptions at the higher level, then there is a good case to be made in terms of \u2018subsidiarity\u2019\nto leave each of the lower-level jurisdictions to determine its own choices for itself.57\nVI. CONCLUSION\nMajoritarian democrats are ordinarily wary of super-majority requirements. Where we\nhave good grounds for setting the presumption one way rather than another, as we\n55 Jacques Delors et al., Subsidiarity: The Challenge of Change (Maastricht: European Institute of Public\nAdministration, 1991); George A. Bermann, \u2018Taking Subsidiarity Seriously: Federalism in the European\nCommunity and the United States\u2019, Columbia Law Review, 94 (1994), 331\u2013456.\n56 The Court\u2019s rationale follows the logic set out in Cass R. Sunstein, \u2018The Right to Die\u2019, Yale Law Journal,\n106 (1997), 1123\u201363. The US Supreme Court\u2019s actions later that year seem to be acting on that principle: it ruled\nin 1997 that there is no constitutionally guaranteed right to die, which states are required to respect (in Washington\nv. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill); later that same year, however, the Court also refused to hear a challenge to\nan Oregon law granting people a right to die (Lee v. Harcleroad, No. 96\u20131824, certeriori denied).\n57 We are grateful to Dennis Mueller for this observation.\nSpecial Majorities Rationalized 237\nsometimes do, it may be perfectly legitimate to let the outcome often be determined by\nthe defaults built into Asymmetrical Special-Majority rules. But more often there seems\nto be no good reason for allowing decision rules to favour one outcome over any other in\nthat way, in advance.\nThe asymmetrical version of the Special-Majority rule is the most familiar form. Were\nit the only form, unease at the arbitrariness of setting a presumption one way rather than\nsome other (absent any grounds for setting a presumption either way) would incline us\ntowards Simple-Majority rule instead. That is certainly the standard way of avoiding any\narbitrary bias in favour of one \u2018default\u2019 option.58\nThe asymmetrical form is not the only possible form of special-majority voting,\nhowever. Special-majority requirements can be specified in such a way as to apply equally\nto all options. Under a Symmetrical Special-Majority rule, no option is privileged as the\ndefault option. Arbitrariness is avoided, just as it is under Simple-Majority voting. And\nsomething else is achieved as well: procedurally, the special protection that comes with\nthe \u2018special majority\u2019 requirement is afforded to minority interests; epistemically, a higher\nstandard of proof for making decisions is implemented. Such special minority protection\nor such a special standard of proof may not always be warranted, and, where they are not,\nSimple-Majority rule works well. But where we have good reasons for thinking that\nlarger-than-bare majorities ought to be required for decisions in any direction, we ought\nto use a Symmetrical Special-Majority rule instead. And with the symmetrical version of\nthat rule, we can do so in full confidence that no option will be arbitrarily privileged by\nbeing the default option.\nThat decision rule has not heretofore received the attention it deserves, owing perhaps\nto doubts as to its practical feasibility. Symmetrical Special-Majority rules run the risk of\nleaving too many things open, which might be undesirable. That practical concern can be\naddressed, however, if we supplement the Symmetrical Special-Majority rule with other\ndecision procedures, such as venue-shifting options available in the judicial or federal\nrealms.\nAPPENDIX I: MAJORITARIAN-TYPE RULES AND THEIR PROPERTIES\nA Majoritarian-type rule with parameters k\u0005 and k\u0002 (k\u0002 \u0007 k\u0005 ). For any v,\n\u23a7 1 if \u0002vi\b k\u0002\nf (v)\u0001 0 if k\u0002 \u0007\u0002vi\u0007 k\u0005\u23a8\n\u00051 if \u0002vi\n k\u0005 (k\u0002 \u0007n or k\u0005 \u0006 \u0005n are admissible).\u23a9\nProposition A1. A voting rule satisfies (U), (A), (M) if and only if it is a Majoritarian-type rule for some\nvalues of k\u0002 and k\u0005 (k\u0002 \u0007 k\u0005 ).\nProof. It is easy to see that a Majoritarian-type rule satisfies (U), (A) and (M). Conversely, suppose a voting\nrule f satisfies (U), (M) and (A).\nStep 1. We show that, for any v, w, \u0002vi\b\u0002wi implies f (v)\b f (w). For each v, let #v denote the number\nof 1s in the profile v. Suppose \u0002vi\b\u0002wi. Then #v\b#w (since vi and wi only take the values \u00051 or 1).\nLet v\u2019 :\u0001 \u00061, \u2026 , 1, \u00051, \u2026 , \u00051\u0007 and w\u2019 :\u0001 \u00061, \u2026 , 1, \u00051, \u2026 , \u00051\u0007 .\n#v n\u0005#v #w n\u0005#w\n58 Except to break truly \u2018trivial\u2019 ties.\n238 G O O D I N A N D L I S T\nSince v\u2019 and w\u2019 are, respectively, permutations of v and w, by (A), we have f (v)\u0001 f (v\u2019) and f (w)\u0001 f (w\u2019).\nSince #v\b#w, v\u2019\bw\u2019. By (M), f (v\u2019)\b f (w\u2019). But since f (v)\u0001 f (v\u2019) and f (w)\u0001 f (w\u2019), we have f (v)\b f (w),\nas required.\nStep 2. Step 1 implies that there exists an increasing function\ng: {\u0005n, \u0005n\u00021, \u2026 , n\u00051, n}\u2192 {\u00051, 0, 1}\nsuch that, for any v, f (v)\u0001g(\u0002vi). This implies that there exist k\u0005 , k\u0002 \u0001 {\u0005n, \u0005n\u00021, \u2026 , n\u00051, n}, where\nk\u0005 \u0006 k\u0002 , such that\n1 if \u0002vi\b k\u0002\u23a7\u23a8f (v)\u0001 0 if k\u0002 \u0007\u0002vi\u0007 k\u0005\n\u00051 if \u0002vi\n k\u0005 (k\u0002 \u0007n or k\u0005 \u0006 \u0005n are admissible). \u0001\u23a9\nThe following propositions state some properties of a Majoritarian-type rule.\nProposition A2. A Majoritarian-type rule never takes the value \u00051 if k\u0005 \u0006 \u0005n; it never takes the value\n1 if k\u0002 \u0007n; it never takes the value 0 if k\u0002 \u2013 k\u0005 \u00011 or [k\u0002 \u2013 k\u0005 \u00012 and k\u0002 and n are both odd].\nProposition A3. A Majoritarian-type rule satisfies (NT) if and only if either (i) [k\u0002 \u2013 k\u0005 \u00011 or [k\u0002 \u2013 k\u0005 \u00012\nand k\u0002 (\t1) and n are both odd]] or (ii) [k\u0002 \u00011 and k\u0005 \u0001 \u00051].\nCase (ii) is the special case of Simple-Majority Voting. Case (i) is the case of Asymmetrical\nSpecial-Majority Voting.\nProposition A4. A Majoritarian-type rule satisfies (PVk) if and only if k\u0002 \u0007n\u00052k. It satisfies (NVk) if and\nonly if k\u0005 \u00062k\u0005n.\nAPPENDIX II: PROOFS OF THE RESULTS IN SECTION I\nTheorem 3 (stated above). A voting rule satisfies (U), (A), (S) and (M) if and only if it is a Symmetrical\nSpecial-Majority rule for some parameter m\u00070.\nProof. It is easy to see that, if f is a Symmetrical Special-Majority rule for any value of m (m\u00070), then\nf satisfies (U), (A), (S), (M). Suppose, conversely, that f satisfies (U), (A), (S), (M). By proposition A1,\nthere exist k\u0002 and k\u0005 (where k\u0002 \u0007 k\u0005 ) such that, for any v,\n1 if \u0002vi\b k\u0002\u23a7\u23a8f (v)\u0001 0 if k\u0002 \u0007\u0002vi\u0007 k\u0005\u23a9\u00051 if \u0002vi\n k\u0005 (k\u0002 \u0007n or k\u0005 \u0006 \u0005n are admissible).\nNow, since f satisfies (S), k\u0002 \u0001 \u0005 k\u0005 . Since k\u0002 \u0007 k\u0005 , we must have k\u0002 \u00070\u0007 k\u0005 \u0001 \u0005 k\u0002 . Put m\u0001 k\u0002 .\nThe result follows. \u0001\nTheorem 1 (May\u2019s Theorem) and its corollary can be deduced from Theorem 3, by observing that\nconditions (VR1) and (NT) are each satisfied by a Symmetrical Special-Majority rule if and only if m\u00011\n(or m\u00012 and n is even).\nProposition 2 (stated above). If a voting rule satisfies (U), (NT), (PVk1) and (NVk2), then k1\u0002 k2\bn.\nProof. Assume, for a contradiction, that f satisfies the conditions of the proposition with k1\u0002 k2\u0006n. So\nwe cannot have both k1\u0001n\/2 and k2\u0001n\/2. Without loss of generality, assume that k1\tn\/2. Consider a\nprofile v where v1, \u2026 , vk1\u0001 \u00051, and vk1\u00021, \u2026 , vn\u00011. Then \u0004{i\u0001N: vi\u0001 \u00051}\u0004\u0001 k1, and so, by (PVk1),f (v)\t1. Also, \u0004{i\u0001N: vi\u00011}\u0004\u0001n\u0005 k1\u0007 k2 (since k1\u0002 k2\u0006n) and so, by (NVk2), f (v)\t \u00051. Hencef (v)\u00010. By (NT), this implies \u0002vi\u00010. But \u0002vi\u0001n\u00052k1\t0, a contradiction. Hence k1\u0002 k2\bn. \u0001\nProposition 4 (stated above). Suppose a voting rule satisfies (U) and (S). Then, for any k, it satisfies (PVk)\nif and only if it satisfies (NVk).\nProof. This proposition follows immediately from condition (S). \u0001\nThe conjunction of Propositions 2 and 4 immediately entails Theorem 2.\nSpecial Majorities Rationalized 239\nProposition 1 (stated above). A voting rule satisfies (U), (NT), (S) and (PVn\/2) (and (NVn\/2)) if and only\nif it is Simple-Majority rule.\nProof. If f is Simple-Majority rule, f clearly satisfies the relevant conditions. We prove the reverse\nimplication. Suppose f satisfies (U), (NT), (S) and (PVn\/2). Suppose \u0002vi\u00060. This implies \u0004{i\u0001N:\nvi\u0001 \u00051}\u0004\bn\/2, and hence, by (PVn\/2), f (v)\t1. But, since \u0002vi\u00060, (NT) implies f (v)\t0, and therefore\nf (v)\u0001 \u00051. By (S), if \u0002vi\u00070, this implies that f (v)\u00011. If \u0002vi\u00010, we must have \u0004{i\u0001N: vi\u0001 \u00051}\u0004\u0001n\/2.\nBy (PVn\/2), f (v)\t1. But by (S), we must also have f (v)\t \u00051, i.e. f(v)\u00010. Hence f is Simple-Majority\nrule. \u0001\nPropositions 3 and 5 follow immediately from Proposition A4.\nProposition 6 follows from the definition of a Symmetrical Special-Majority rule. Note that, for any m, a\nSymmetrical Special-Majority rule with parameter m is equivalent to a rule with parameter m*, where\nm* is \u0003the smallest even number greater than or equal to m if n is even\nthe smallest odd number greater than or equal to m if n is odd.\nProposition 7 follows immediately from Theorem 3 and Propositions 5 and 6.\nProposition 8 (stated above). If a Symmetrical Special-Majority rule satisfies both (PVk1) and (VRk2), then\nk2\u0007n\u00052k1.\nProof. Suppose f is a Symmetrical Special-Majority rule with parameter m. Without loss of generality we\ncan assume that m is even if n is even, and odd if n is odd. By proposition 5, m\u0007n\u00052k1. By Proposition\n6, m\u0006 k2\u00022. Note that n\u00052k1 is even if and only if n is even. So, when n is even, the smallest even number\ngreater than n\u00052k1 is n\u00052k1\u00022. Likewise, when n is odd, the smallest odd number greater than n\u00052k1\nis n\u00052k1\u00022. So m\bn\u00052k1\u00022. But, since m\u0006 k2\u00022, we must have k2\u00022\u0007m\bn\u00052k1\u00022,\ni.e. k2\u0007n\u00052k1. \u0001\nAPPENDIX III: PROOFS OF THE RESULTS IN SECTION II\nTheorem 4 (restated). For any standard of proof parameter c significantly greater than 1\/2, there exists no\nvoting rule satisfying (U), (NT*), (PPc) and (NPc).\nProof. Suppose f is a voting rule satisfying (U), (NT*), (PPc) and (NPc).\nLet v:\u0001 \u00061, \u2026 , 1, \u00051, \u2026 , \u00051\u0007 , where\n#v n\u0005#v\n#v:\u0001\u0003n\/2\u00021(n\u00021)\/2 if n is evenif n is odd.\nThen \u0002vi \u0001 2 if n is even, and \u0002vi \u00011 if n is odd. By a formula by Condorcet,59 Pr (X\u00011\u0004V\u0001 v)\u0001\np\u0002vi\/(p\u0002vi \u0002 (1\u0005p)\u0002vi). So Pr (X\u00011\u0004V\u0001 v)\u0001p2\/(p2\u0002 (1\u0005p)2)) if n is even, and Pr (X\u00011\u0004V\u0001 v)\u0001p if n\nis odd. Note that Pr (X\u00011\u0004V\u0001 v)\t1\/2. Since f satisfies (NT*), we must have f (v)\t0. So f (v)\u00011 or\nf (v)\u0001 \u00051. Since f satisfies (PPc), if f (v)\u00011, then Pr (X\u00011\u0004V\u0001 v) \u0007 c; so c\u0006p2\/(p2\u0002 (1\u0005p)2)) if n is\neven, and c\u0006p if n is odd. Since f satisfies (NPc), if f (v)\u0001 \u00051, then Pr (X\u0001 \u00051\u0004V\u0001 v)\u0007 c,\ni.e. 1\u0005Pr (X\u00011\u0004V\u0001 v) \u0007 c; so c\u00061\u0005p2\/(p2\u0002 (1\u0005p)2))\u0006p2\/(p2\u0002 (1\u0005p)2)) if n is even, and\nc\u00061\u0005p\u0006p if n is odd. Therefore c is not significantly greater than 1\/2, in the technical sense defined\nabove. \u0001\nProposition 9 (restated).

It is easy to check that Simple-Majority Voting satisfies (U), (PP1\/2) and (NP1\/2) (under Condorcet\u2019s\nassumptions). Suppose f satisfies (U), (PP1\/2) and (NP1\/2). Let v be any profile.

We\nconclude that f is Simple-Majority Voting. \u0001\nProposition 10 (restated). Suppose a voting rule satisfies (U) and (NT*), and suppose c1 is significantly\ngreater than 1\/2. If the voting rule satisfies (PPc1), then it does not satisfy (NPc2) for any c2\b1\/2; and if\nit satisfies (NPc1), then it does not satisfy (PPc2) for any c2\b1\/2.\nProof. Suppose f satisfies (U), (NT*) and (PPc1), where c1 is significantly greater than 1\/2. Suppose further\nthat f satisfies (NPc2) for some c2\b1\/2. Define v as in the proof of theorem 4. Then c1\bPr (X\u00011\u0004V\u0001 v)\u00071\/\n2. By (PPc1), f (v)\t1. By (NT*), f (v)\t0.

The proof that if f satisfies (NPc1) then f does not satisfy (PPc2)\nfor any c2\b1\/2 is analogous. \u0001\nProposition 11 (restated). Let c\b1\/2. A voting rule satisfies (U), (PPc) and (NPc) if and only if it is a\nSymmetrical Special-Majority rule, where the parameter m is the smallest integer strictly greater than\nlog(1\/c\u00051)\/log(1\/p\u00051).\nProof. Suppose f satisfies (U), (PPc) and (NPc), where m is the smallest integer above log(1\/c\u00051)\/\nlog(1\/p\u00051)). Then\nf (v)\u00011 if and only if Pr (X\u00011\u0004V\u0001 v)\u0007 c,\nf (v)\u0001 \u00051 if and only if Pr (X\u0001 \u00051\u0004V\u0001 v)\u0007 c.\nBy (U), we must therefore have f(v)\u00010 if and only if c\bPr (X\u00011\u0004V\u0001 v)\b1\u0005 c.\nBy a theorem in an earlier paper by List,61\nPr (X\u00011\u0004V\u0001 v)\u0007 c if and only if \u0002vi\u0007 log(1\/c\u00051)\/log(1\/p\u00051)),\ni.e. \u0002vi\bm, with m as defined above.\nSimilarly, Pr (X\u0001 \u00051\u0004V\u0001 v) \u0007 c if and only if \u0005\u0002vi\u0007 log(1\/c\u00051)\/log(1\/p\u00051)),\ni.e. \u0002vi\n \u0005m, with m as before.\nFinally, c\bPr (X\u00011\u0004V\u0001 v)\b1\u0005 c if and only if m\u0007\u0002vi\u0007 \u0005m. We conclude that f is a Symmetrical\nSpecial-Majority rule with parameter m. It is easy to check that, if f is a Symmetrical Special-Majority rule\nwith parameter m, then f satisfies (U), (PPc) and (NPc) with m as defined above. \u0001\n60 List, \u2018On the Significance of the Absolute Margin\u2019.\n61 List, \u2018On the Significance of the Absolute Margin\u2019.\nSpecial Majorities Rationalized 241\nAPPENDIX IV: A VERSION OF THE EPISTEMIC CASE IN TERMS OF THE DEGREE OF SUPPORT\nAgain we make Condorcet\u2019s assumptions, except that no assumption about prior probabilities is required\nhere. The degree of support some evidence E gives to some hypothesis H is defined to be l(H,\nE):\u0001 log(Pr(E\u0004H)\/Pr(E\u0004\u0003H).62 The degree of support the voting pattern V\u0001 v gives to the hypothesis X\u00011\nis l(X\u00011, V\u0001 v)\u0001\u0002vi log(p\/(1\u0005p)).

For any profile v, f (v)\u00011 if and only if l(X \u00011,\nV\u0001 v)\u0007 c.\nA standard of proof of c for negative decisions (NP*c). For any profile v, f (v)\u0001 \u00051 if and only if l(X\u0001 \u00051,\nV\u0001 v)\u0007 c.\nThe standard of proof corresponding to Simple-Majority rule is c\u00010. We can now state corollaries of\nTheorem 4 and Propositions 9 to 11.\nProposition 9*. In Condorcet\u2019s model, a voting rule satisfies (U), (PP*0) and (NP*0) if and only if it is\nSimple-Majority rule.\nThe classical (non-Bayesian) statement of no non-trivial ties, then, is\nNo non-trivial ties (NT**). For any profile v, f (v)\u00010 implies l(X \u00011, V\u0001 v)\u0001 l(X\u0001 \u00051, V\u0001 v)\u00010.\nClearly, Simple-Majority Voting satisfies (NT**).\nLet us say that the threshold c is significantly greater than 0 if\nc\b\u0003log(p\/(1\u0005p))2log(p\/(1\u0005p)) if n is oddif n is even.\nTheorem 4*. For any standard of proof parameter c significantly greater than 0, there exists no voting rule\nsatisfying (U), (NT**), (PP*c) and (NP*c).\nProposition 10*. Suppose a voting rule satisfies (U) and (NT**), and suppose c1 is significantly greater\nthan 0. If the voting rule satisfies (PP*c1), then it does not satisfy (NP*c2) for any c2\b0; and if it satisfies(NP*c1), then it does not satisfy (PP*c2) for any c2\b0.\nProposition 11*. Let c\b0. A voting rule satisfies (U), (PP*c) and (NP*c) if and only if it is Symmetrical\nSpecial-Majority Voting, where m is the smallest integer strictly greater than c\/log(p\/(1\u0005p)).\nThe case c\u00010 corresponds to Simple-Majority rule. The case c significantly greater than 0 but less than\nn log(p\/(1\u0005p)) corresponds to a Special-Majority rule. The case c greater than or equal to n log(p\/(1\u0005p))\ncorresponds to Imposed Indifference.\n62 Branden Fitelson, \u2018A Bayesian Account of Independent Evidence with Applications\u2019, Philosophy of Science,\n68 (Proceedings) (2001), S123\u201340.\n\n"}
