INTRODUCTION\nThe main objective of the Wireless Hybrid Enhanced Mobile\nRadio Estimators (WHERE) project is to study radio posi-\ntioning techniques using existing and future heterogeneous\ncommunications systems and to optimize the various layers\nof the communication systems (modulation, channel estima-\ntion and equalization, radio resource management, etc.) by\nexploiting the availability of reliable estimator for the position\nof mobile terminals (MTs) [1]. In order to provide reliable\nand accurate position information, the WHERE consortium\nresearches hybrid and cooperative positioning.\nFor reliable positioning, it is necessary to exploit as much\npositioning information as possible. Typical measurements to\ncompute the position of MTs include time of arrival (TOA),\ntime-difference of arrival (TDOA), angle of arrival (AOA),\nreceived signal strength (RSS), Doppler frequency, finger-\nprinting, etc. Different systems may provide these position\nbased measurements, e.g., cellular mobile radio communica-\ntions systems, short range communication systems, or even\nglobal navigation satellite systems (GNSS\u2019s). Potentially each\nadditional available measurement can improve the accuracy,\navailability, and reliability of the overall position solution.\nIn a first step, the WHERE consortium studies hybrid data\nfusion (HDF) algorithms to combine various measurements\nresulting in a single position solution. Additionally, we will\nimprove the position solution by tracking the position of the\nMT, e.g., in point-to-point navigation. Yet, data fusion and\ntracking may still provide insufficient accuracy and reliability.\nThus, in a second step, the WHERE consortium researches\ncooperative positioning to further enhance the accuracy and\nreliability of positioning.\nII. SCENARIOS\nAs a first task, the WHERE consortium has been discussing\nand evaluating different scenarios to research and investigate\nHDF and cooperative positioning algorithms. For some sit-\nuations, highly accurate positioning solutions are available\nalready today. For instance, the positioning accuracy achieved\nby using the GNSS systems is in the range of a few meters\nin rural areas where several satellites can be seen line-of-sight\n(LOS) [2]. So the focus should be on more challenging envi-\nronments and scenarios. Finally, we agreed on the following\nthree different scenarios [3].\nThe first scenario T1 addresses small-scale situations mainly\nin indoor environments where short-range ultra-wideband\n(UWB) links locally complement cellular systems such as\nthe 3rd Generation Partnership Project Long Term Evolution\n(3GPP-LTE). Alternatively, we may consider a Wi-Fi system\ncooperating with wireless personal area networks (WPANs),\ne.g., ZigBee.\nThe second scenario T2 is a medium-scale indoor scenario,\ntypically in an office-building. Here, a Wi-Fi system com-\nplements cellular 3GPP-LTE or cooperates with Worldwide\nInteroperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) systems.\nThe indoor scenarios T1 and T2 have both in common that\nthere is no GNSS available.\nThe third scenario T3 is a large-scale environment that\nconsiders GNSS and cellular communication system-based\npositioning in urban canyon situations. Due to the availability\nof GNSS, the scenario T3 serves as a reference to compare the\nnovel positioning methods developed in WHERE to already\navailable approaches (cf. [4]). In all three scenarios, we assume\npedestrian users.\nClearly, the investigations for all scenarios can be extended\nto several cooperating users where the focus is both on the\nachievable overall positioning accuracy and the impact on\nthe communications infrastructure. The overall investigation\nof different scenarios allows to evaluate the performance for\na seamless outdoor\/indoor navigation using current and future\nsystems.\n978-1-4244-1722-3\/08\/$25.00 \u00a92008 IEEE. 1\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Conventional Hybrid Data Fusion Algorithms\nHDF algorithms in the context of positioning applications\nestimate the position (if desired also velocity and orientation)\nof the MT over time. Due to the different kinds of sensors\nthat can provide location-dependent parameters (TOA, TDOA,\nAOA, etc.), it is a challenging part of the positioning process\nto combine and weight all measurements in an optimum way\n[5]. Furthermore, the dependence between the measurements\nand the position is usually non-linear. Clearly, the navigation\nequation [5] can be solved on a snap-shot base assuming a\nstatic user. A better approach is to use the underlying mobility\nmodel of the user as input to the HDF algorithms. It allows to\ninclude a-priori knowledge for the current estimate based on\nprevious estimates. For instance, the a-priori knowledge could\nbe a maximum velocity of 10 km\/h if we assume pedestrian\nusers as very simple mobility model.\nBayesian filter approaches are widely used for HDF and\ntracking purposes. However, the classical linear Kalman filter\n(KF) [6] is not directly applicable to this problem due to\nthe non-linear relation between the measurements and the\nposition. Hence, extended KF (EKF) or unscented KF (UKF)\nare good candidates for such approaches. For instance, the\nEKF linearizes the measurement and mobility models around\na certain working point (based on recent estimates) and applies\nthen the KF to this linearized system. Also more complex\nparticle filters (PF) have gained a lot of attraction recently\n[7].\nFigure 1 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF)\nof the position estimation error using a 3GPP-LTE system in\nan indoor environment as in Scenario T2 [4]. For the simula-\ntions, a 3GPP-LTE cellular network with inter-site distance of\n1500m was assumed and TDOA measurements were extracted\nfrom the incoming signals. The navigation equation was solved\nassuming a static as well as a dynamic user. In the latter case\npedestrian users were assumed whose positions are tracked by\nmeasures of an EKF approach. The building was assumed to\nbe at the cell edge which is a reasonably well-behaved scenario\nsince signals from several base stations can be received very\nwell. Even though, we see that only in 55% of the cases the\nerror is below 100m for the static solution. With EKF tracking\nthis can be improved to 82%. However, it is obvious that in\nthis critical situation support in terms of additional sensors\nor cooperative positioning is required to allow a satisfying\nnavigation.\nB. Novel Hybrid Data Fusion Algorithms\nTwo novel hybrid data fusion algorithms [8], [9] have been\nproposed recently within the framework of WHERE.\nIn the first novel approach [8], a particle filter (PF) is\nused to track the path parameters directly from the received\nsignals. The data fusion that is performed usually as a separate\nstage in the conventional tracking algorithms, is now implicitly\ndone during the parameter estimation. Simulations show that\nby exploiting the temporal evolution of the parameters, this\n0 50 100 150 200\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\nx [m]\nCD\nF,\n P\n(er\nror\n < \nx)\n \n \nStatic solution\nEKF\nFig. 1. CDF of the error in indoor position estimation with 3GPP-LTE\nnovel approach exhibits higher estimation accuracy and ro-\nbustness against noise and interference than the conventional\nalgorithms.\nThe second novel approach [9] proposed by WHERE uti-\nlizes a single-stage scheme, where the trajectories of object\npositions in a Cartesian coordinate system are estimated di-\nrectly from the received signals without introducing any inter-\nmediate parameters, such as delays, Doppler frequencies and\nazimuths of arrival. In this approach, the motion of the object\nis parameterized by its position, velocity and acceleration.\nSignals observed from multiple sensors are modeled directly as\nfunctions of the object trajectory. The trajectory estimates are\nupdated recursively using a PF. Similar with the first approach,\nfusion of the observations from multiple sensors is implicitly\nincluded when estimating the object trajectories.\nFigures 2 (a) and (b) depict the a-posterior pdf of the object\ntrajectory for two examples in a single-object scenario. In these\nsimulations, a multistatic passive radar system is considered,\nwhere Digital-Video-Broadcasting Terrestrial (DVB-T) signals\nreflected by a moving object are obtained with three receivers.\nThe a-posterior pdf exhibits a global maximum that is located\nat the true object position. This indicates that the trajectory of\nan object can be estimated by maximizing the a-posterior pdf.\nFigure 3 depicts the estimated trajectories obtained by\nusing the proposed PF-based single-stage approach and two\nconventional tracking algorithms in a single-object scenario.\nThe two latter algorithms use a PF and an EKF respectively\nto track the object trajectory from the estimates of Doppler\nfrequency and delay of the received signal. It can be observed\nthat the trajectory estimated with the single-stage PF fits the\ntrue trajectory well, while the trajectory estimates obtained\nwith the conventional algorithms using multiple stages exhibit\nsignificant deviations.

COOPERATIVE POSITIONING\nCooperative positioning is a recent research topic in wire-\nless communications systems. These positioning schemes are\nsuitable for scenarios where several technologies and mobile\nnodes coexist in an heterogeneous network. Figure 5 shows\na schematic representation of the concept of cooperative\npositioning.The goal is to enhance position estimators of the\nmobile nodes, given that they share link information with\nnearby nodes. This concept permits the use of spacial diversity\nin positioning algorithms.\nA. Conventional Cooperative Positioning Algorithms\nThe concept of cooperative positioning was first proposed\nin Japan for acquiring real-time positioning information of\nmobile robots [10]. This concept, mostly applied nowadays to\nwireless sensor networks (WSN), has been recently introduced\nto heterogeneous communication networks [11]\u2013[14]. Some of\nthe aspects present in the WSN context are also present in\ngeneral communication networks, however the heterogeneity\nof nowadays wireless communication networks can be seen as\n3\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Current research has\naimed at porting WSN positioning algorithms into communi-\ncation networks. In [12], the author exploits user cooperation\nin a least squares framework where cellular and ad-hoc links\nare combined in a single module of the system. Instead in\n[11], [13], common Bayesian filtering, namely KF, is used for\ncombining short- and long-range links. In [14] the authors\npropose a mathematical formulation based on the absolute\nposition obtained by the cellular system followed by a routine\nof optimization that uses the information from the short-range\nlinks. Common aspects and subsequently similar results can\nbe expected for example from Crame\u00b4r-Rao bound analysis in\nWSN. The Crame\u00b4r-Rao bound was analyzed for some example\nnetworks [15]. In general, some of the important aspects con-\ncerning cooperative positioning in wireless networks are for\ninstance: technology integration in a heterogeneous network,\npositioning information overhead, distributed computing, and\nnode clustering management. Though multihop positioning,\nas it is known in the WSN context, is also possible in\nheterogeneous networks, its implementation may require more\nrobust clustering algorithms since wireless nodes are, by\nnature, mobile. Current cooperative schemes classify the nodes\ninto two groups:\n\u2022 \u201canchor nodes\u201d whose positions are known (e.g., obtained\nvia GNSS or manually set by the operator) and commonly\nstatic;\n\u2022 \u201cunknown nodes\u201d that are located at unknown positions,\ngenerally localized with cooperative schemes by sharing\nof information.\nB. Novel Cooperative Positioning Algorithms\nCooperative positioning techniques can be enhanced at least\nin the following three aspects:\n1) State-of-the-art approaches are based on the assumption\nthat each node has direct connection with the others\nin LOS. However, in practical wireless networks there\nare many new nodes that cannot reach anchor nodes or\nother new nodes due to various factors, such as large-\nscale fades, shadowing effects, limited radiation power,\netc. In such cases the current approaches that rely on\nthe assumption of direct LOS perform poorly. Therefore,\nestablishing an appropriate and meaningful mathematical\nmodel has a wide implication for cooperative positioning.\n2) Signal-processing complexity and training\/signaling over-\nhead are two key problems for existing cooperative posi-\ntioning schemes. For example a network accommodating\nN nodes, each new node needs to perform distance esti-\nmation (range measurement) for (N \u2212 1) point-to-point\nlinks. This requires significant signal-processing pay par-\nticularly for a large N . Moreover, each new node needs to\nbroadcast both training information and its measurement\nresults. This can result in significant training\/signaling\noverhead and create difficulties to medium-access control\n(MAC). In order to resolve these problems, the WHERE\nconsortium will investigate different solutions for bal-\nancing the trade-off between signaling\/training overhead\n2MDs 4MDs 6MDs 8MDs 10MDs\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nG\nai\nn \nof\n c\noo\npe\nra\ntio\nn \nvs\n. n\non\n\u2212c\noo\npe\nra\ntio\nn \n(%\n)\nNumber of Cooperative Devices\nFig. 6. Gain in accuracy for Mobile cooperative schemes with respect to\ntraditional non cooperative schemes.\nand positioning accuracy. This overhead can be reduced\ne.g. by lowering the measurement\/signaling frequency or\nby limiting the number of cooperating nodes. As shown\nfor a specific scenario in [13], and reproduced in Fig. 6\nthe positioning accuracy gain that can be obtained when\nincreasing the number of cooperating nodes becomes\nlimited for large node sets. In the considered scenario\nthe accuracy gain when going from 6 to 8 cooperating\nnodes is less than 5%, whereas the step from 2 to 4 nodes\nincreases the accuracy by approximately 25%. Besides\nthe number of cooperating nodes, the locations of the\ncooperating nodes will have a significant influence on\nthe accuracy. For example, we observe on the right hand\nside of Figure 2 that the maximum of the location pdf is\neither diffuse or sharply concentrated dependent on the\nlocations of the sensors. This motivates a proper selection\nand partitioning of cooperating nodes. Specifically the\nWHERE consortium proposes to perform cooperative\npositioning for a group of nodes. Node grouping and\nselection strategies should be carefully devised in terms\nof factors such as group size, estimation accuracy, etc.\n3) Lacking LOS to anchor nodes is one of the major moti-\nvations for the WHERE project to consider cooperative\npositioning. Therefore, one of the key questions, the\nWHERE project seeks to address is: what is the minimum\nnumber of anchor nodes that is required for offering\nsufficient accurate positioning information? The Crame\u00b4r-\nRao bound is a good metric to analyze this issue and\nshows the impact of the constellation of anchor nodes on\nthe positioning accuracy. The WHERE consortium will\nfirst investigate this problem for some special examples\nwith the assumption of perfect synchronization, and then\nextend results to more general cases.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nTo conclude, the WHERE consortium researches novel HDF\nand cooperative schemes for wireless positioning to provide\naccurate and reliable location information. Among others, we\nfocus on short-range UWB and WPAN, mid-range Wi-Fi, and\nlong-range 3GPP-LTE and WiMAX radio technologies for\n4\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Then, the HDF algorithm tracks\nthe position through these parameters. In contrast, we present\ntwo novel PF based HDF algorithms, which either track the\npath dependent parameters or the position directly from the\nreceived signal.\nSince in some cases, the position accuracy and reliability\nmay still not be sufficient to improve communications sys-\ntems, we research new cooperative positioning schemes. Here,\nthe focus of our work will be on establishing appropriate\nmathematical models accounting for LOS and non-LOS prop-\nagation, balancing the trade-off between signaling overhead\nand positioning accuracy, and finding the minimum number\nof required anchor nodes for offering sufficiently accurate\npositioning information.\nWith the accurate and reliable position information obtained\nby HDF and cooperative schemes, we can then enhance the\nperformance of mobile communication systems.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work has been performed in the framework of the ICT\nproject ICT-217033 WHERE, which is partly funded by the\nEuropean Union.\nREFERENCES\n[1] \u201cEU-ICT FP7 Project Wireless Hybrid Enhanced Mobile Radio Estima-\ntors (WHERE),\u201d http:\/\/www.ict-where.eu\/.\n[2] P.
