This was subsequently used as the basis on which to compare the merits of three approaches to QRA modelling in such\nsystems. The original model used a Bayesian Network (BN). The second method was a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\napproach, a numerical Bayesian technique which retained a similar network structure but allowed further development, such as\nthe separation of variability and uncertainty. The third method was a more detailed simulation model.\nThe BN responds immediately to changes, such as entering evidence, because it does not use simulation and can propagate\ninformation from any point in the network to all others by Bayesian inference. However, it requires all the variables to be\ndiscrete, which introduces errors if continuous variables have to be discretized. These errors can accumulate. The MCMC\napproach does not require discrete variables while retaining some of the properties of the BN model, such as the ability to draw\ninferences from evidence. Finally, the simulation offers greater flexibility, such as consideration of the individual carcass, but\nmay be more complex to implement as a result and sacrifices the ability to propagate evidence.D 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The\nreview found 906 publications on Salmonella from\n1988 to 1998, of which 94 contained potentially\nuseful quantitative data. On further examination, only\nabout one-third could be used for model development;FOOD-03102; No of Pages 17\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nD.J. Parsons et al. \/ International Journal of Food Microbiology xx (2004) xxx\u2013xxx2most of the others did not provide sufficient informa-\ntion on the effects of processes on the chain. In\ngeneral, processing, especially operations such as\ncarcass washing, received more attention than primary\nproduction.\nThe industry survey, which included representa-\ntives of all the large UK producers of chicken meat,\nfound that there was widespread monitoring for Sal-\nmonella at all stages of production and implementa-\ntion of HACCP procedures to control it. At that time,\nthe contamination rate in final products was 3\u201320%,\nmainly in two clusters at the ends of that range. Since\nthen, there has been progress in reducing these levels.\nThe model was based on the information available at\nthe time. WHO\/FAO (2002) contains surveys of more\nrecently published information on Salmonella in\npoultry.\nThe remainder of this paper will concentrate on the\nQRA model for Salmonella in the poultry meat\nproduction chain from the breeder farm to the chiller.\nIt will outline the analysis methods leading to the\nqualitative model and describe three approaches to the\nquantitative model in order to compare their strengths\nand weaknesses for this type of work. The first\u2014a\nBayesian network (BN) or causal probability network\n(CPN)\u2014was developed for the original study; the\nother two resulted from subsequent research on ap-\npropriate modelling techniques.\nQRA is the study of decisions subject to uncertain\nconsequences using the tools and techniques of prob-\nability theory and statistics (Royal Society, 1992). It is\napplied in many different fields; Hoornstra and Noter-\nmans (2001) looked at how to apply QRA to food\nsafety. The typical products of a QRA exercise would\nbe a series of statements of potential harms, whether\nexpressed as financial costs or harmful consequences\nto the population, and the probabilities associated\nwith them. Typical examples include the probability\nof death in middle age for male and female non-\nsmokers and statements of the number of deaths per\npassenger mile or passenger journey for different\ntypes of transport. Related disciplines include: risk\nperception, the study of how people think about risk;\nrisk communication, the effective transmission of\ninformation about risk; and risk management, taking\ndecisions in uncertain situations so as to control risk\nto an acceptable level. Vose (1998) looked at model-\nling techniques and probability distributions that canbe used in a Monte Carlo simulation QRA model.\nThis paper looks at alternative ways of implementing\nQRA models.\nOne of the key features of QRA is that it attempts\nto look at whole systems and not at isolated parts.\nEach possible adverse event is followed through to its\nconsequences, and the consequences of different\nadverse events can be combined. This is only possible\nusing a quantitative approach which provides a com-\nmon basis for the evaluation of risks and harms.\nThe final stages of transport, retailing, cooking and\nconsumption were not within the scope of the study,\nso it was not possible to quantify harm in public\nhealth terms. This would require extensive studies of\nthe handling and treatment of poultry products in\ndomestic and commercial kitchens and the derivation\nof dose response functions for exposure to the path-\nogen; an example of a risk assessment that does this\nfor Salmonella in chicken can be found in WHO\/FAO\n(2002), which commences at the conclusion of\nslaughterhouse processing. Instead, harm was mea-\nsured in terms of the carriage rate of the pathogen on\nthe final product. Furthermore, the sampling and\nculturing techniques required for the pathogen of\ninterest mean that, generally, it is not possible to\nestimate the number of organisms carried; the data\nare normally presented simply as the proportion of\nbirds estimated to be positive, so this is the variable\nwith which the model has to work.2. Systems analysis\nAlthough the qualitative and quantitative analysis\nof this section was done with the idea of a BN model\nin mind, it is relevant for all of the models used in this\npaper.\n2.1. Qualitative analysis\nThe qualitative structure of the model as a network\ndiagram was developed through a formal systems\nanalysis procedure which was similar in many ways\nto the knowledge acquisition phase of an expert\nsystem development. A series of meetings was held\nwith \u2018domain experts\u2019. These people were the partners\nand consultants to the project with specific expertise\nin the poultry industry and microbiology. In the first\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nD.J. Parsons et al. \/ International Journal of Food Microbiology xx (2004) xxx\u2013xxx 3phase, meetings were held with pairs of domain\nexperts which proceeded as follows:\n1. The main stages in the process were identified:\nBreeder Farm, Hatchery, Broiler Farm, Processor.\n2. Each stage was broken down into a series of\nsubprocesses.\n3. Inputs, outputs and cross-contamination routes at\neach stage were identified.\n4. The resulting network was reviewed for errors and\nomissions.\nSteps 2\u20134 were repeated until the parties were\nsatisfied with the result.\nAs a result of the information collected, the first\nversion of the network was constructed. This was\npresented at a full meeting of the project team\nincluding some of the domain experts who had not\nbeen included in phase 1. All partners were given hard\ncopies of the network to consider and were asked for\ntheir feedback. As a result of this feedback, a secondFig. 1. Network showing the 18 prevalence nodes for the key operations and\noutput at the hatchery.phase of revisions was undertaken after which it was\nagreed that all of the major features of the system had\nbeen captured. Inevitably, a few disagreements\nremained, but these were mainly the results of differ-\ning practice within different sectors of the industry.\nThe main steps and some detail of the final version of\nthe network are shown in Fig. 1.\n2.2. Quantification of the model\nAs noted above, the first implementation of the\nmodel was a Bayesian network, which required quan-\ntification of each stage in terms of probabilities. These\nformed the basis for each of the subsequent models, so\nthe details will be described together with the first\nmodel, but some general issues will be reviewed first.\nThe parameters for statistical models are usually\nestimated from experimental work, but no single\nexperiment has been carried out in the detail required\nto allow estimation of the parameters of these models.\nHowever, in network models, quantification is per-stages in the model and some of the details for the model inputs and\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nD.J. Parsons et al. \/ International Journal of Food Microbiology xx (2004) xxx\u2013xxx4formed locally for each node, so it is possible to\ncombine data from several different sources. The\nBayesian view of probability also encompasses sub-\njective degree of belief, which extends the range of\ninformation that can be included. The sources were\n1. data published in the literature where available;\n2. data from the industry survey and other unpub-\nlished sources; and\n3. expert opinion.\nAs was noted in Section 1, the literature search\nfound about 30 papers containing data useful for the\nstudy. However, some of these could not be used to\nestimate model parameters directly because their data\ndid not link processes in the model. As a result, more\nreliance was placed on companies\u2019 in-house data and\nthe opinions of the expert group, and thus, the values\nof many parameters had to be chosen subjectively.\nEdel (1994) has data showing that around 1% of\nbreeder flocks in The Netherlands in 1989\u20131992 were\nclassed as positive. Expert opinion said that roughly\n10% of the birds in a positive flock would be\ncontaminated with Salmonella, while virtually none\nof the birds in a negative flock would be contaminat-\ned. The expert group thought that about 30% of the\neggs laid by a contaminated bird would be positive on\nthe interior and that there would be a strong possibility\nof cross-contamination of the eggshells via the litter in\nthe nest boxes. Data from Dodd (personal communi-\ncation) and the experts agree that there should only be\na small change in prevalence after the transport of the\neggs to the hatchery. The group disagreed about\nwhether the disinfecting of the eggs would be 100%\neffective. In the model, if disinfecting is used, then 2%\nof the eggs that were contaminated will remain\ncontaminated. Bailey et al. (1996) showed that about\n50% of the hatched chicks will be positive when 99%\nof their shells are. Data from Dodd (personal com-\nmunication) show that there is a low risk of cross-\ncontamination of the chicks on transport to the farm\nwhen the level of contamination in the chicks is low.\nHowever, the quality of the disinfectant that is used in\nthe boxes is important, and it was thought that cross-\ncontamination can be quite high when this is poor.\nOn the farm, there are many factors that can\ninfluence the carriage rate of Salmonella in the flock,\nand various papers contain data looking at these.Hargis et al. (1995) looked at the persistence of\nSalmonella enteritidis in a flock, Larsen et al.\n(1993) looked at the effect of treating feed, Ramirez\net al. (1997) looked at the effects of feed withdrawal,\nDavies and Wray (1995) examined the possibility of\nmice carrying Salmonella and Carr et al. (1995)\nlooked at the type of broiler shed. However, these\npapers do not report data that link the level on\nentering the farm to that on leaving the farm. The\nexperts thought that there would be a high risk of\ncross-contamination on the farm. The industry survey\nsuggested that the levels of Salmonella on entering the\nprocessor could be quite small, although data from\nDodd (personal communication) show that this could\nbe over 20%. It is believed that there is a moderate\nrisk of cross-contamination in transport to the pro-\ncessing plant and that the cleaning of the crates is\nimportant.\nExpert opinion was divided on the effects of cross-\ncontamination at the hanging on, stunning and bleed-\ning stages; some said that cross-contamination would\nnot be a problem here, while others said that there can\nbe a high risk of aerial contamination. The risk of\ncross-contamination during the scalding operation\ncould vary widely depending on the temperature of\nthe water in the scald bath. Clouser et al. (1995) has\nsome data showing an increase in the prevalence after\nthe plucking operation with a conventional defeat-\nhering system, and although the sample size is small,\nthe experts agreed that this is a major source of cross-\ncontamination. During the head pull and preparation\nfor evisceration, there is a high risk of cross-contam-\nination if the viscera are exposed, which depends on\ngood management practice.\nCarramin\u02dcana et al. (1997) reported data on the\nchanges in prevalence of Salmonella during eviscer-\nation, although no significant changes were detected.\nExpert opinion said that there is a high risk of cross-\ncontamination if the guts are ruptured, but a low to\nmoderate risk otherwise. The type of machine and\nsetting for bird size are important factors here. The\nexperts said that there would be a low to moderate\nrisk of cross-contamination during the cleaning pro-\ncess. Various papers report data on the effects of\ncarcass washing, but these are all in terms of log\ncount reductions and do not report the effects on\nprevalence. It was thought that there would be a very\nlow risk of cross-contamination and that the use of\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nD.J. Parsons et al. \/ International Journal of Food Microbiology xx (2004) xxx\u2013xxx 5chlorine in the wash may reduce counts but not\ncarriage rates of Salmonella. Brewer et al. (1995)\nlooked at the effects of processing line speed on the\nprevalence before and after the carcass wash; they\nfound a slight reduction in prevalence after washing\nat low speeds and little difference at higher speeds.\nCason et al. (1997) suggested that the prevalence of\nSalmonella within a flock does not change much\nafter chilling. The expert group indicated that there\nwould be a low risk of cross-contamination, and that,\nlike the washing, chilling may reduce counts but not\ncarriage rates. There is a moderate to high risk of\ncontamination and cross-contamination during the\nportioning and packing operations if the process is\nbadly managed.\nHaving completed the initial quantification of the\nmodel, it was demonstrated to the domain experts\nfrom the project working in small groups. These\nmeetings were used to review the final structure and\nthe response of the model to changes in the inputs to\nensure that the behaviour was reasonable. As a result\nof the process of quantification and review, some\nchanges were made to the structure of the network.\nSeveral of these were simplifications made by com-\nbining consecutive processes. This was normally\ndone when one or more processes were found to\nhave a negligible effect and could therefore be\ncombined with preceding or following processes\nwhose effects were more significant. On a few\noccasions, processes were also combined when it\nwas impossible to find any information on the effects\nof the individual processes. So, for example, the\ninitial detailed breakdown of the series of evisceration\nsteps was simplified to give three main steps: head\npull and preparation, evisceration, and cleaning. In\naddition to reducing the amount of data needed, this\nalso had the effect of reducing the number of sources\nof uncertainty in the model and thus the noise in the\noutcomes.\nThe other main simplification was the reduction in\nthe number of inputs to the major processes. Initially,\nthese had been broken down into fairly detailed\ncategories, such as hygiene of catching crew, crate\ncleaning, vermin and so on. Again, there were insuf-\nficient data to be able to quantify these inputs, so in\nmost cases, they were grouped into single nodes\nrepresenting management practices and labelled in\nthe network as \u2018factors\u2019. A few of these inputs forwhich better data were available, for example, the\nscald tank temperature, were retained. To create a\nfully detailed model, a series of new input nodes into\nthe factors would be required to break them down into\nall of the contributing elements. However, this would\nrequire the collection of detailed and site-specific data.3. Bayesian network model\n3.1. Construction\nA Bayesian network consists of a graphical repre-\nsentation of the structure of a model and a mathemat-\nical formulation of the relationships within it (Jensen,\n1996). The graphical part of the model consists of a\nseries of boxes known as nodes, which represent the\nmain variables in the system. The nodes are connected\nby arrows known as arcs, forming a directed graph.\nEach arc represents a causal relationship, i.e., the node\nat the tail of the arrow has some effect on the one at\nthe head. In general, there may be many arcs going\ninto and out of each node, creating a complex net-\nwork. The most important restriction is that the arcs\nmust not create loops or cycles within the network; the\nresulting network is known as a directed acyclic\ngraph (DAG). An example of a BN approach to\nQRA modelling of foodborne hazards is that of Barker\net al. (2002).\nFig. 1 shows a simple top-level view of the\nnetwork for the poultry production system from the\nbreeder farm through to the end of processing. In this\ncase, each node represents one of the following: a\nprocess within the whole production system, the state\nof management factors or parameters for a process, or\na monitoring point. The node C_Leaving_farm, for\nexample, represents the proportion of birds that are\npositive when they leave the farm. So, working\nbackwards in the network, the previous node\nC_Entering_farm means the proportion of birds that\nare positive after transport to the farm, and the arrow\nlinking the two represents all of the changes that take\nplace between the two points, i.e., while the birds are\non the farm. All the quantities in the network are\ndescribed in terms of probabilities. Within Bayesian\nnetwork software packages, these must normally\nexpress discrete distributions, except for special\ncases, such as the Gaussian distribution. For this\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nD.J. Parsons et al. \/ International Journal of Food Microbiology xx (2004) xxx\u2013xxx6model, the carriage rate at each stage is divided into a\nset of categories such as less than 1%, 1\u20133%, 3\u20135%,\n5\u201310% and so on. The quantities handled by the\nmodel are the probabilities of inclusion in these\nclasses, so the final outcome includes the probability\nthat less than 1% are positive and so on for each\nclass, giving a probability distribution. If necessary,\nthe expected number can be calculated as the mean of\nthis distribution.\nFor those nodes without parents (i.e., those without\nlinks coming into them), it is necessary to supply a set\nof initial values or prior probabilities. So, in the\nsimplified example above, these would be the proba-\nbilities of numbers of positive birds in the parent\nflock. In the full model, there are many more such\nnodes, generally related to management practices that\nhave an influence on the outcome.\nEach of the other nodes contains a conditional\nprobability table that expresses the relationship be-\ntween the output variable from the node and the input\nvariables. Taking the Entering_Processor node in Fig.\n1, this would be a whole array of probabilities such as\nthe probability that less than 1% of birds entering the\nprocessor are positive given that less than 1% of birds\nleaving the farm are positive, or that between 1% and\n3% are positive or 3% and 5% and so on. For more\ncomplex nodes, where there are several parents having\na causal effect, it is easy to see that it would be\nnecessary to create a very large table. The final model\nconsists of 95 nodes and 121 arcs with a total of\n13,414 conditional probabilities. Clearly, estimating\nthese directly would require a very extensive data set,\nwhich is not available. However, by describing the\ndistributions as parametric Beta distributions, the\nmodel was reduced to 60 parameters.\nThe distinctive feature of Bayesian Networks is\nthat the state of every node in the network is\ncalculated by inference using repeated applications\nof Bayes\u2019 rule. The initial state of the network is the\njoint probability distribution of all the nodes and is\nderived from the prior distributions of the nodes\nwithout parents and the conditional probability tables\nof those with. The distributions of the network in this\nstate are called the prior distributions. Evidence may\nbe entered into the network at any node\u2014for exam-\nple, an observation that the carriage rate on leaving\nthe farm is between 1% and 2%\u2014and the conse-\nquences of this are propagated to all the other nodes.With modern software and hardware, this is normally\nvery quick, unless the network is highly connected or\nthe conditional probability tables are very large.\nThe resulting distributions are called the posterior\ndistributions.\nThe model was implemented using the NETICA\npackage produced by Norsys Software of Vancouver.\nThe full version of the model expands on the simpli-\nfied form presented in Fig. 1 and includes four types\nof nodes.\n1. Those in the main trunk of the network represent a\nrandom variable corresponding to the level of\ncontamination at a particular stage of the process.\nFor example, the node Stunning represents the\nproportion of contaminated birds immediately after\nthe stunning\/bleeding stage.\n2. Inputs which represent the level of hygiene at a\ncertain stage (so Scald_Temp flags whether scald is\nhard or soft); the management factors nodes are of\nthis type.\n3. Outputs, such as Hatchery_Fluff_Sampled, repre-\nsenting a quantity that could be measured.\n4. Model parameters (e.g., T1_Scald, T2_Scald,\nBeta_Scald and P_Scald)\nThese are illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. Each of the\nnodes in the main trunk, such as Scald, represents the\nprevalence distribution of Salmonella in the flock\ndefined numerically as a Beta distribution conditional\non the values of the node\u2019s parents. Because the Beta\ndistribution is continuous, this is divided into series of\ndiscrete categories as described earlier. The model\nparameters for any stage, P, T1, T2 and Beta are used\nto derive the parameters of this Beta distribution. The\nparameter Beta may be interpreted as a measure of the\nvariability in the data; large values of Beta correspond\nto small variances. T1 measures the probability that an\negg, bird or carcass that is contaminated before a\nparticular process will still be contaminated at the end\nof it. In general, this value is close to 1 as very few\nprocesses actually reduce contamination. T2 is a\nmeasure of the probability that an uncontaminated\nbird will become contaminated and is normally small\nbut very rarely zero. Finally, P measures the relative\nimportance of environmental contamination and\ncross-contamination. If cross-contamination is not a\nmajor problem in a process, then P will take a large\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nFig. 2.

Parsons et al. \/ International Journal of Food Microbiology xx (2004) xxx\u2013xxx 7value, whereas if cross-contamination is dominant, P\nwill have a small value.\n3.2. Testing\nThe absence of suitable data for development of\nthe model also meant that there were no suitable\ndata sets for validation. The best that could be done\nwas to look at the general outcomes in comparison\nwith sources such as the survey data and to look at\nthe responses to specific changes in the input\nvariables.\nWith no inputs set, the \u2018factors\u2019 have their default\ndistributions (typically Prob[good] = 0.01, Prob[aver-\nage] = 0.98, Prob[poor] = 0.01). All of the nodes in the\nmodel then have their prior distributions. The prior\ndistribution of the final carriage rate (shown in Fig.\n3A) had a mean of 8%. With all the factors set to\n\u2018good\u2019 or the equivalent, the mean of this finalcarriage rate was reduced to 4%. The effects on the\nmean of changing individual inputs from the default\nto the worst setting are shown in Table 1.\nThe range of responses is plausible in the light of\nthe survey result described earlier, where the best\nproducers achieved mean final carriage rates of 3\u2013\n5%, but poorer controls led to rates in the range of\n13\u201323%. The relative effects of the different factors\nare also reasonable, although the absolute values\nrequire confirmation.\n3.3. Results\nThe model can be used to make inferences about\nsystem variables. Setting certain prevalence nodes to\nbe \u2018observed\u2019, the effects of this evidence are propa-\ngated throughout the network, and the updated mar-\nginal distributions of all other domain variables can be\nviewed. For instance, should a flock of poultry arriv-\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nFig. 3.

Parsons et al. \/ International Journal ofto good showed that in general, contamination early in\nthe process produces the largest effect. However, the\nfinal portion-and-pack operation, with high potential\nfor contamination and cross-contamination, is also\nimportant. Clearly, multiple failures of hygiene will\nlead to higher carriage rates. On the other hand,\ndisinfection of the eggshell (usually with formalde-\nhyde) can control problems caused by external con-\ntamination of eggs. Setting the hatchery litter\ncondition to \u2018bad\u2019 without disinfection produces a\nmean final carriage rate of 26% through infection of\nthe chicks. This is returned to 8% by the use of\ndisinfectant.\nOne useful feature of the Bayesian Network mod-\nelling approach is that it allows the inclusion of\noutcome nodes representing sampling points. Such\nnodes are normally linked to the model variables by\ntables representing the probabilities of having true or\nfalse positive and true or false negative observations.\nThey can thus model the uncertainty that is present in\nobservations and be used to investigate the potential\nbenefits of improved sampling and assay techniques.\nAt present, the only such node is Hatchery_Fluff_\nSampled, which represents the outcome of testing a\nfluff sample for the presence of Salmonella. With the\ndefault settings, the outcome here is 1.3% of samples\npositive. Setting the sample to negative had a negli-\ngible effect on the final carriage rate, but setting it to\npositive increased the mean rate to 24% because it\nimplied a serious hygiene failure in the hatchery or\nbreeder farm. Although this result is only illustrative,\nit shows how the use of monitoring points can be\nmodelled.3.4. Discussion\nThe network approach was used as it is an excel-\nlent probabilistic reasoning tool. The local quantifica-\ntion of variables enables the parameter specification\nprocess to incorporate data from various sources and\nthe opinions of field experts. By manipulating the\nusers\u2019 assumptions of conditional independence, the\nBN software updates the probability distributions for\nall other domain variables in the presence of obser-\nvations of certain variables, allowing the user to make\ninferences and answer questions about the interactions\nbetween variables in the system. However, because\nthe BN method requires the discretization of general\ncontinuous variables, errors can result in the marginal\ndistributions.\nFood Microbiology xx (2004) xxx\u2013xxx 94. MCMC models\n4.1. Construction\nThe Bayesian methodology seems appropriate for\nmodelling the prevalence of Salmonella-positive birds\nin a flock, with its approach to uncertainty and its\nability to infer about both likely causes and effects of\nobservations. The BN method used, however, relies\non the discretization of continuous variables, and this\nincurs errors in the marginal distributions. Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods provide an\nalternative means of updating the probabilities in a\nnetwork model. They use numerical integration to\napproximate probability distributions and therefore\ndo not necessitate the division of continuous variables\ninto discrete ranges.\nThe WinBUGS software package can be used for\nthe Bayesian analysis of complex statistical models\nusing MCMC techniques (Spiegelhalter et al., 2003).\nIt allows users to set up a model as a DAG, incorpo-\nrating both stochastic and deterministic nodes. The\nsystem is given some consistent initial state and the\nprogram then progresses through some causal order-\ning of the nodes, sampling from each of their condi-\ntional distributions (given the current values of all\nother variables in the system). When this process is\nrepeated (using the same ordering of nodes), the\ndistributions produced converge to the true marginal\nprobability distributions. For an introduction to\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nD.J. Parsons et al. \/ International Journal of Food Microbiology xx (2004) xxx\u2013xxx10MCMC methods and their applications, see Brooks\n(1998).\nA model was constructed in WinBUGS as an\nequivalent of the BN model. The only difference\nbetween the models produced using the two\napproaches was that the BN model required that the\ncontinuous variables be discretized, whereas the\nMCMC model did not. Using an MCMC sampling\nalgorithm, the resulting distributions converge to the\ntarget densities. This produces substantially different\nmarginal distributions (particularly for \u2018downstream\u2019\nnodes) from those produced in the Netica BN soft-\nware. These differences in the output arise due to the\ndiscretization of continuous variables, as is required\nby the BN approach. Denoting the true target density\nby p and by taking a large enough sample, MCMC\nmethods such as the Gibbs sampler can be used to get\nas close an approximation to p as desired, and thus,\nthis approach seems more reliable in this example.\nA method for determining the number of iterations,\nn, required for convergence of one long run of the\nGibbs sampler can be found in Brooks (1998). This\nmethod produces an estimate of n = 27,000 iterations\nfor convergence of the Portion_and_Pack distribution\nin the model. This is based on a pilot run of 1000\niterations. It produces n for which there is a probabil-\nity of 0.95 that the mean of these samples lies within\n0.001 of the true mean. Similar calculations for the\nother variables and models used in this section all\nsuggest that using 50,000 iterations is sufficient to be\nconfident of convergence.\n4.2. Results\nThe WinBUGS program was used to produce\n50,000 iterates of the model. This resulted in theTable 2\nSummary statistics for the prior and posterior (with the evidence that the\ndistributions of Salmonella in the parent flock, the flock upon entering the\nBeta distribution model\nNode Prior distributions\nMean 2.5 percentile 97.5 per\nParent_Flock 0.27 1.5 10\u0001 15 1.8\nEntering_Processor 1.4 1.9 10\u0001 10 8.7\nPortion_and_Pack 4.0 0.0017 29\nThis model was created as an equivalent to the original BN model.marginal distributions for the prevalence in the\nparent flock, the flock on entering the processor\nand the processed and packaged carcasses, shown as\na table of summary statistics in Table 2, and as\nsmoothed density plots in Fig. 4A. To show how\nthese distributions might be compared to those\nproduced using the BN model, the prior distribution\nfor the final portion-and-pack operation is discre-\ntized using the same range boundaries as in the BN\nmodel and this is shown in Fig. 5. The two different\ncausal probability network updating methods pro-\nduce significantly different output in terms of the\nmeans of the final marginal distributions; the BN\napproach gives l = 8% and the MCMC approach\ngives l = 4%.\nAs with the BN model, inferences can be made\nabout system variables using MCMC methods. This is\ndone by entering evidence and then sampling to\napproximate all other posterior distributions. Al-\nthough using this method for inference is slower than\nusing a BN for a similar model, the answers obtained\nare more accurate, so long as enough samples have\nbeen taken for convergence. Using the same example\nevidence as entered into the BN model (0\u20130.3%\nprevalence on entering the processor), 50,000 itera-\ntions were run.

Comparing the posterior distributions pro-\nduced using the MCMC method with those produced\nusing the BN once again highlights the differences\nbetween the two approaches.

Model development\nThe MCMC model described above was formulat-\ned for comparison with the BN model, so the param-\neters were modelled by discrete distributions.\nHowever, with MCMC methods, one can consider\nmodelling the parameters with continuous distribu-\ntions. This is done by fitting distributions about each\nof the point estimates for the parameters from the BN\nmodel. Beta distributions are fitted about the T1 and\nT2 parameter estimates, and censored normal distri-\nbutions, about the P parameter estimates; T1 and T2\nare therefore defined as Beta-mixture and P as nor-\nmal-mixture distributions.\nThe Beta distribution was used in the original\nmodel for the prevalence of Salmonella in the flock\nas a simplification; it is flexible enough to model a\nwide range of behaviour over a closed interval.\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nD.J. Parsons et al. \/ International Journal of Food Microbiology xx (2004) xxx\u2013xxx12However, given the parameters as defined, it is\nmore natural to consider a combination of binomial\ndistributions.\nBy considering the number of birds in a flock that\nare contaminated with Salmonella, it is possible to\nmodel the number of birds that remains contaminated\nand the number that becomes contaminated after a\ncertain process. Both of these are modelled separately\nby binomial (n,p) distributions, and the sum of these\ntwo variables gives the total number of birds that is\ncontaminated with Salmonella after the process. The\nparameters T1, T2 and P, along with the number of\nbirds previously contaminated and the flock size\nvariable, N, are used to derive the relevant n and p\nparameters. The flock size variable N is set to\nN = 10,000 for the following models.\nThis model is an example of what is known as\ntwo-dimensional modelling. Vose (1998) defines un-\ncertainty as the lack of precise knowledge one has\nabout a model parameter and variability as the ran-\ndom effects of chance that might occur in the system.\nA two-dimensional model aspires to separate these\ntwo components, and in this case, does so by encap-\nsulating the variability in the binomial distributions\nand the uncertainty in the (continuous) parameter\ndistributions.\nThis two-dimensional model can be used to inves-\ntigate the effects of variability and uncertainty on the\noutput. Table 3 compares some summary statistics for\nthe final Portion_and_Pack distribution in the differ-\nent instances of this two-dimensional model. With\nfixed point estimates for the parameters, the resulting\nmodel is without uncertainty (as defined above) butTable 3\nSummary statistics for the prior prevalence distributions of Salmonella i\nbinomial distribution model\nUncertainty Parameter distributions Factors\n1 Yes Discrete Unknown\n2 Yes Continuous Unknown\n3 No Discrete Knowna\n4 Yes Discrete Unknown\n5 Yes Continuous Knowna\n6 Yes Continuous Unknown\nThis model is an example of two-dimensional modelling, in which th\nuncertainty (discrete or continuous distributions for parameters, \u2018factors\u2019 c\nseparated out.

With continuous parameter distributions, but a\ndeterministic model which uses these parameters to\ncalculate an expected number of contaminated birds at\neach stage, the model has uncertainty but no variabil-\nity. The final marginal distribution, in this case, is\nspread depending on the variances of the parameter\ndistributions (see rows 1 and 2 of Table 3).\nWith the state of factors known for all nodes, the\nmodel can be thought of as representing a known\nfarm or processing plant, on which the state of the\nmanagement factors for each operation can be cat-\negorised as either good, average or poor (or other-\nwise, as appropriate). With the discrete parameter\nmodel, this gives fixed parameter values for all stages.\nRow 3 of the table shows the statistics for this\nscenario (with all factors in their most probable state)\nand gives a very narrow 95% interval of [2.6%,\n3.4%]. The continuous parameter model gives a more\nbroadly spread output, the 95% interval being [0.31%,\n13%] (row 5 of Table 3), reflecting a more realistic\nscenario.\n4.4. Discussion\nMCMC methods provide a good means of approx-\nimating the marginal probabilities in a Bayesian\nnetwork. The fact that it is not necessary to discretize\nthe continuous variables means that such errors are\nnot incurred and that the methods can be used to\nproduce a more accurate representation of a model.\nThe two-dimensional approach appears to be moren the flock after portioning and packing, as given by the MCMC\nVariability Mean 2.5 percentile 97.5 percentile\nNo 3.3 2.7 6.3\nNo 4.0 0.34 14\nYes 2.9 2.6 3.4\nYes 3.2 2.5 6.6\nYes 3.6 0.31 13\nYes 4.0 0.33 14\ne variability (binomial distributions for individual variation) and\nonsidered to be known\u2014i.e., good\/average\/poor\u2014or unknown) are\nariability and uncertainty.\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nD.J.

Considering\nsuch a two-dimensional model within the BN frame-\nwork would require the introduction of further con-\ntinuous nodes. The attempt to separate out the\nuncertainty from the variability would introduce more\ndiscretization errors to the network.5. Simulation models\n5.1. Construction\nAnother approach that may be used to model the\ncontamination of poultry with Salmonella spp. is\nMonte Carlo simulation. This uses forward sampling\nand has no reliance on Bayes\u2019 law and on the\ncalculation of conditional sampling distributions. It\ncan be used to more efficiently tackle some problems\nthan the Bayesian methods could and hence to model\nmore complex interactions between domain variables.\nAn example of a QRA model that uses this method-\nology is by Cassin et al. (1998). This uses Monte\nCarlo simulation to assess the human health risk\nassociated with Escherichia coli O157:H7 in ground\nbeef hamburgers.\nA computer program was written, using the C++\nprogramming language, which modelled the status of\nindividual birds throughout the system. For each stage\nof the example system, each bird was considered\nseparately as a Bernoulli trial with a probability\ndependent on its own current status, on the current\nprevalence in the flock and on the stage parameters.\nThe two-dimensional modelling approach was used\nwith both uncertainty and variability included. TheTable 4\nSummary statistics for the prior and posterior (with the evidence that the\ndistributions of Salmonella in the parent flock, the flock upon entering th\nversion of the MC simulation model\nNode Prior distributions\nMean 2.5 percentile 97.5 per\nParent_Flock 0.30 0 2.0\nEntering_Processor 1.4 0.04 6.3\nPortion_and_Pack 3.8 0.24 15\nThis model uses the parameters defined for the original BN model but consparameters were modelled by continuous distributions\nand the original default distributions were used for the\nstates of the factors. This model was essentially the\nsame as the two-dimensional MCMC model but con-\nsidered the birds in separate Bernoulli trials as opposed\nto together in a binomial distribution.\nIt should be noted here that the choice to write a\nprogram from scratch rather than use an existing\npackage for the simulation was made after brief trials\nwith the @RISK (Palisade) package. The simulation\nmodels the status of 10,000 birds as they pass through\nthe various stages and operations. The status of each\nthese birds at each of these operations is a random\nvariable, giving 180,000 variables, too many for an\nExcel (Microsoft) spreadsheet to handle. In addition,\nthe package was found to be slow for the kind of\nsimulation being performed, which consists of a chain\nof distributions, each deriving its parameters from\nsamples from the previous distribution in the chain.\n5.2. Results\nThe model was run for 50,000 iterations. The mean\nand 95% interval of the resulting marginal distribu-\ntions for the prevalence in the parent flock, on\nentering the processing plant and after portioning\nand packing are shown in Table 4. These summary\nstatistics are, as one might expect, similar to those\narrived at for the binomial model updated using\nMCMC methods (see Table 3, row 6). The kernel\ndensity estimates are shown in Fig. 6A.\nSuppose that the system is to be studied under the\nobservation of a prevalence of between 0% and 0.3%\non entering the processor.

The results of these inferences are comparable to\nthose made with previous models (see Fig. 3 and\nTable 2); the effect of the evidence on the means of\nthe marginal distributions is a similar reduction in all\nmodels.\n5.3. Model development\nUsing the Monte Carlo simulation approach, a\nmore complex model can be considered than would\nbe practical in a Bayesian methodology. Suppose\nthat there is a flock of birds entering the processing\nplant. These birds are immediately hung on shackles\non a conveyor to be stunned. Once on the conveyor,\nthe individual birds can be considered ordered in asequence, in which it seems plausible that for each\nbird, cross-contamination is more likely to come\nfrom the birds in a close proximity to it than from\nthose further away. In the previous models, the\ncross-contamination depended on the prevalence of\nSalmonella within the entire flock. With the con-\nsideration of the individual bird or carcass, this\ncould be made to depend on the status of the\nsurrounding birds only. A weighted average of the\nprevious k birds to pass through was used to\ndetermine the cross-contamination probability, where\nk was chosen to be 100.\nUsing the two-dimensional model with both vari-\nability and uncertainty, 50,000 iterations of the for-\nward sampling algorithm were performed. This\nproduced the distribution for the prevalence after the\nportioning and packing operation shown as a\nsmoothed probability density estimate in Fig. 7. This\ndistribution has mean 4.1% and 95% interval [0.26%,\n15%]. The distributions for the prevalence in the\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nFig. 7.

Discussion\nThe model developed in this section is an example\nintended to illustrate some of the possibilities offered\nby Monte Carlo simulation, and further extensions of\nthis could of course be investigated. Although it\nwould be possible to use the Bayesian methodology\nin formulating a similar model, the additional com-\nplexity might render it impractical.\nIn a full microbiological risk assessment, it is\nnormally necessary not only to model the prevalence\nof positive birds in a flock but also to quantify the\nnumber of organisms present in these birds. This is\ndone so that dose\u2013response studies may be incorpo-\nrated into the QRA, and the associated human health\nrisks investigated. In order to do this, it appears\nsensible to consider an individual based model, which\nmay be more suited to the simulation framework, as\nthe problem could be too complex to consider a model\nin the Bayesian format. An example of such a model\nthat looks at the numbers of organisms present is by\nWhiting and Buchanan (1997) for S. enteritidis in\npasteurised liquid eggs. However, lack of relevant\ndata that quantifies the number of organisms present\nat the various stages in the model can often mean that\na complete quantitative model is not possible, and so\nthe benefits offered by a Monte Carlo simulation may\nbe redundant.6. Discussion\nIn this paper, it has been shown how the techniques\nof Bayesian network modelling, Markov chain Monte\nCarlo and simulation modelling can be used to for-\nmulate a model for use in a quantitative risk assess-\nment, within the context of one particular example\nsystem. The potential of each method has been illus-\ntrated by considering various different types of model.\nThe BN method was found not to represent the\nheavily skewed distributions accurately due to the\nneed to discretize continuous variables. In the exam-\nple network, these errors are compounded throughout\nthe system, so that the mean of the final prevalence\ndistribution was given as 8%, when the true repre-\nsentation of this model should be around 4%. Al-\nthough it is a quick and straightforward task to enter\nevidence into the network and make inferences about\nother domain variables, the answers produced can be\ninaccurate, as was shown in the example.\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo methods can be used\nto produce an approximation to the target distribu-\ntion, and this, in the models for the Salmonella\nexample, proved to be a more accurate way of\nupdating the probabilities than the BN method. As\nthe number of samples taken is increased, this ap-\nproximation converges, and the number of iterations\nrequired can be estimated. Inferences, in the light of\nevidence, can be made on all domain variables using\nMCMC methods. This is done by entering the\nobservations (i.e., fixing the values of the appropriate\nvariables) and performing iterations of the sampling\nalgorithm until convergence occurs. Because MCMC\nmethods deal directly with the continuous variables\nin a system, such methods may be confidently used\nto approximate the marginal probabilities in two-\ndimensional models, which separate out the uncer-\ntainty and variability.\nThe simulation method offers more modelling\nflexibility. Because it only considers forward sam-\npling, there is no need for any calculation of compli-\ncated conditional distributions (using Bayes\u2019 law), and\nthus more complex models may be considered. This\nallows the effects of introducing logical expressions to\nthe model, dependent on many other variables, to be\ninvestigated, and this also enables models to look at\nboth prevalence and the load of an organism in a\nQRA. Were a DAG to be considered for such a model,\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nD.J. Parsons et al. \/ International Journal of Food Microbiology xx (2004) xxx\u2013xxx16it would have to be highly connected, and the sam-\npling procedure rendered painfully slow.\nInference in the simulation framework is not so\nstraightforward. Analysis of the system when there is\nan observation of some variable is performed by\nrunning many simulations of the model and retaining\nonly the runs for which this condition is satisfied.\nHowever, if the probability of this is small, then this\nprocess will be very wasteful and time consuming.\nWorse still, should the evidence be an observation of a\npoint value for a continuous variable, this approach to\ninference becomes impossible.7. Conclusions\nThe Bayesian network method was shown to be the\nmost appropriate when inference and speed are im-\nportant. However, complexity is limited and errors\ndue to the discretization of continuous variables can\nrender this method an inaccurate representation of the\nmodel distributions.\nMonte Carlo simulation permits the use of more\ncomplex models and is thus often used for QRA\nmodels to capture the intricacies of a process, but it\nis fairly slow and inference is not straightforward.\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo methods offer a good\ncompromise between the BN approach and Monte\nCarlo simulation in terms of speed and flexibility.\nThey also support inference while being able to\naccurately model continuous distributions.\nTwo-dimensional modelling, a method for separating\nthe variability and uncertainty in a model, can be used\nwith MCMC methods and Monte Carlo simulation.Acknowledgements\nThe original case study was funded by the UK\nMinistry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food, project\nnumber FS3305.
