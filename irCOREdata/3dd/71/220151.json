Though understandable in some respects this nonetheless \nrepresents something of a missed opportunity. As gate-keepers and agenda-setters for much of the \nremainder of the criminal justice system, the police occupy a key position and this article \nconsequently argues that reform programmes must focus upon the role the police play in regulating \nthe flow of young people into the justice system. More particularly, it argues that we need to \nrehabilitate the idea of \u2018diversion\u2019 and, in particular, to rescue it from the one-sided picture that \nbecame dominant from the mid-1990s onward. \n \n \nKeywords: Youth crime: anti-social behaviour; policing; reform \n \n \nIntroduction \nThe main argument in this article is a straightforward one. It begins with the simple observation that the \nrecently published Independent Commission report \u2013 Time for a Fresh Start \u2013 like many previous reports \nadvocating reform of youth justice, has relatively little to say about the role of the police. Despite its many \nother strengths, this relative absence of comment on policing represents  a missed opportunity.  That is,  \nwithout  engagement with the role of the police \u2013 in relation to such issues  as their day-to-day interactions \nwith young people, stop and search practices, responses to \u2018pre-criminal\u2019, antisocial behaviour, the operation \nof cautioning systems and, more generally,  their role as gatekeepers to the criminal justice system \u2013 efforts \nat reform will be at best incomplete.  My argument, therefore,  is not with what the Independent Commission \nhas to say \u2013 much of which I  agree with \u2013 but largely with what it doesn\u2019t say. In short, my view,  hardly a \nnovel or a controversial one, is that much of what happens in the youth justice system depends upon a \nseries of decisions taken  earlier by the police. These decisions \u2013 how best to respond to allegations of anti-\nsocial or  criminal behaviour , whether or not to stop and search (and how often), when to issue reprimands \nor final warnings, whether  to arrest and construct cases for consideration by the Crown Prosecution Service \n\u2013 all have a potentially dramatic effect on the later operation of the youth justice system. Because the police \nare indisputably the principal gatekeepers to the youth justice system any  radical review of the ways in \nwhich youth antisocial behaviour and crime are dealt with must, therefore, address the role of the police as \nwell as the institutions and procedures more usually associated with the youth justice system. \n \nAt its crudest, this is simply an argument about numbers. The fewer young people that filter through from the \npolice to the youth justice system, the fewer there are who can be subjected to formal intervention (anything \nfrom restorative justice  to incarceration). This is the simple  old-fashioned argument  that diversion from the \ncriminal justice system may, at a very general level, be desirable and that scaling down certain police \n                                                           \n1\n I am indebted to Rod Morgan for considerable assistance with this article and to the anonymous readers for thoughtful \ncomments on an initial draft. \n 2 \nactivities  may be a necessary part of overall reform. Looked  at  from a  broader perspective \u2013 that is \nbeyond the questions of gatekeeping and diversion - my argument is that an overhaul of the operation of the \nyouth justice system, if it is to be far-reaching, requires the \u2018buy-in\u2019 of  all  its major institutions \u2013 including the \npolice. Without police involvement and agreement, reforms to other aspects of the system will be at best \nmitigated and at worst undermined. I return to these two points below, but first a word about the report itself. \n \nTime for a Fresh Start \nIt is not necessary to review the full range of the Commission\u2019s recommendations. Rather, I wish  to draw \nattention to those aspects of the report which, ceteris paribus, might be expected to lead to some \nobservations on the role of the police. The Independent Commission identifies three primary principles -  \nprevention, restoration and integration \u2013 each of which has implications for how the police operate. In \nrelation to prevention, it reviews the by now copious literature on risk and protective factors and argues that \nthere exist \u2018crucial and underexploited opportunities\u2026to prevent prolific, serious and violent offending \ncareers\u2019 (2010: 41). Intervening early is a cost-effective option the Commission argues, though in doing so, it \nacknowledges, it is vital to avoid stigma by not employing labels like \u2018potential criminals\u2019.  \n \nA substantial element of the  Commission\u2019s report is given over to the second principle: restoration. In this \nconnection it highlights the potential illustrated by Northern Ireland\u2019s Youth Conference Service, a youth \njustice-based restorative justice initiative working on referral from the Public Prosecution Service or as a \nresult of a court order. The Commission also presses for greater use of informal responses to antisocial \nbehaviour such as the youth restorative disposal (YRD) currently being piloted in eight police forces in \nEngland and Wales, and greater use of \u2018triage\u2019 procedures within police stations, enabling YOT workers to \nassess the \u2018risk\u2019 presented by particular young offenders and tailoring responses accordingly. Such \nschemes, where they work particularly well, the Commission argues, make a significant contribution to \nreducing the number of \u2018first-time entrants\u2019 to the youth court.  \n \nThe Commission\u2019s third principle is \u2018integration\u2019. Underpinning this, the Commission argues, are three subsidiary \nprinciples: that sanctions and other consequences of intervention should be proportionate; that custody should \nbe used as a last resort; and  that responses to youth offending should do no harm. Beyond these underlying \nassumptions, the Commission  suggests that it should be realistic in future to hold fewer than 1000 young people \nin prison at any one time (at the time of writing there are 2,100), abolish  the shortest custodial sentences ,  \namend  the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act  so that \u2018non-persistent offenders are  given a clean sheet at, or not \nlong after, their 18th birthday\u2019 and institute  \u2018buffer periods\u2019 of perhaps two years for those who have been in \ncustody whereby it would no longer be necessary to disclose their conviction to an employer if there have been \nno further convictions during this period (2010: 81).  \n \nIn all this the Commission has relatively little to say about the police or about policing. This is in some \nrespects  understandable, but it  represents an opportunity missed. The Commission\u2019s main references to \npolicing are primarily in relation to restorative justice initiatives (including the YRD). There are references to \nstop and search and disproportionality (pp.14; 89); cautioning and discretion (p.31), victimization (p.47) and \ngeneral relationships between the police and young people (p.89). But, in the main, these references are  \nfleeting. What might the Commission have said or proposed? In what follows, my observations are divided \n 3 \ninto two main parts. In the first, I want to return to the importance of the police role as gatekeepers to criminal \njustice. My remarks here will focus primarily on the recent history of cautioning, the police role in responding \nto antisocial behaviour, and  the broader question of the police role in influencing recent patterns of first time \nentrants into the criminal justice system. In the second section I turn my attention to the possible impact of \ngovernment policy in relation to policing and criminal justice, and offer some  speculative comments on how \ndevelopments such as budget restrictions, the Green Paper proposals on devolving to local authorities \ncertain costs relating to youth justice, the future of neighbourhood policing, and the proposed introduction of \nPolicing and Crime Commissioners might affect the general territory of youth justice, and the Independent \nCommission\u2019s proposals more particularly.    \n \nThe Police and Young People \nLet us begin at the same point as  the Independent Commission: that the focus should be upon instituting \nchanges which will enable \u2018a continuing decline in the number of children and young people appearing in \ncriminal courts and in custody\u2019 (2010: 17; and see Smith, 2010a).  I agree with much that the Commission \nurges by way of reform: much greater emphasis on restorative approaches (though in the absence of \nsignificant victim involvement in such processes there are doubts as to how truly \u2018restorative\u2019 they are); \nincreasing investment in early preventative activities; and reforms to community-based sanctioning. \nHowever, the Commission misses an opportunity  by failing to address in any detail what currently happens \nat the earliest stages of the criminal justice process \u2013  such as the use of out-of-court  warnings  and \npenalties \u2013 as well as what happens in police-youth interactions prior to any criminal justice intervention.  A \ngrowing body of research evidence appears to confirm aspects of labelling and social reaction theory \nregarding the importance of  \u2018diversion\u2019, particularly in the lives of children at risk of criminalisation.  \n \nContact with the police is a far from unusual occurrence for certain categories of young people (McAra and \nMcVeigh, 2005). Research suggests that young working-class males, especially from ethnic minorities, who \nhave an active \u2018street life\u2019 \u2013 or who exhibit what in some contexts has simply been termed \u2018availability\u2019 (MVA \nand Miller, 2000) - are particularly likely to experience \u2018adversarial\u2019 contact with the police (Aye Maung, 1995; \nFlood-Page et al, 2000). McAra and McVie\u2019s (2005) Edinburgh-based research offers evidence that the \npolice disproportionately target the \u2018usual suspects\u2019. Whilst they are in the first instance  \u2018suspects\u2019  because \nof  their behaviour (including often the volume and seriousness of their alleged offending), \u2018once identified as \na trouble-maker, this status appears to suck young people into a spiral of amplified contact, regardless of \nwhether they continue to be involved in serious levels of offending\u2019 (2005: 9). Their conclusion from the \nanalysis of police-youth interaction suggests that although the police  in some respects adhere to the \nKilbrandon2 aim of avoiding the criminalization of young people, nevertheless an unintended outcome of their \navailable discretion is  the creation of a stigmatized \u2018permanent suspect population\u2019 (2005: 27) of young \npeople. Similar patterns can be seen in relation to the contested territory of stop and search, and although \nthe Independent Commission commends the NPIA\u2019s \u2018Next Steps\u2019 initiative3 in attempting to increase the \n\u2018fairness\u2019 of use of such police powers, it offers no real comment on the very substantial expansion in stop \n                                                           \n2\n After the chairman, Lord Kilbrandon, of a Committee of Inquiry in Scotland into the treatment of young people in trouble \nor at risk. Established in 1960, it reported in 1964 and led, via the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, to the establishment \nof the Scottish Children\u2019s Hearings System. \n3\n Described by Baroness Neville-Jones in parliament as, \u2018a diagnostic tool to ensure that a force\u2019s use of stop and search \nis not driven by other unjustified factors such as discrimination or stereotyping\u2019, \nhttp:\/\/services.parliament.uk\/hansard\/Lords\/ByDate\/20100712\/writtenanswers\/part028.html (accessed 31.1.11)  \n 4 \nand search powers in the quarter century since the passage of PACE. A return to something closer to the \nimmediate post-PACE position would significantly enhance efforts at limiting the criminalisation of young \npeople (Bowling and Phillips, 2007).  \n \nTurning to more formal interventions, the Government has  noted that the criminal sanctioning of young \npeople aged under 18 has in the last few years declined  markedly. From a high point in 2007 when over \n240,000 young people were sanctioned, the number had dropped by a quarter, to roughly 172,000 two years \nlater (Ministry of Justice, 2010a). This is by any measure  a very substantial drop and there are good \nreasons to believe that this shift is less a product of any changes in youth criminal behaviour  and is more to \ndo with the way in which the youth justice system and, crucially, the police, are managed and operate. Fig. A \nillustrates the changes over the last decade. It shows that the number of young people found guilty in the \ncriminal courts remained relatively stable between 1999-2007, since when the numbers have declined by \nabout one sixth. The pattern of use of other sanctions is quite different and much more marked. Thus, the \nsignificant rise in overall sanctioning from 2003 to 2007 was almost entirely due to an increase in the use of \npenalty notices for disorder (PNDs) together with reprimands and final warnings. Moreover, in the two years \nafter 2007, over four-fifths (82 per cent) of the overall drop in sanctioning was accounted for by declining \nnumbers of young people receiving PNDs, reprimands or final warnings.   \n \n   Fig. A: Criminal sanctions imposed on young people aged 10-17, 1999-2009 \n0\n50000\n100000\n150000\n200000\n250000\n300000\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\nPNDs Reprimands and final warnings Findings  of guilt TOTAL\n \nSource: Ministry of Justice (2010a) \n \nWhat lies behind these significant shifts? There is a growing consensus that the answer is to be found in \ngovernment targets and, more specifically, in the pressure brought to bear on the police and other agencies \nvia the measurement of \u2018offences brought to justice\u2019 (OBTJ). This refers to the 2002 PSA target, set for the \nHome Office, which required that the delivery of justice be improved by \u2018increasing the number of crimes for \nwhich an offender is brought to justice to 1.25 million by 2007\u2019 \u2013 in effect a 20 per cent increase in five years.  \nOBTJs for under 18-year-olds were crimes reported to the police that were resolved by means of a \nconviction, reprimand, final warning, PND or offences taken into consideration. The outcome was \npredictable.  Having been set such a target, having their performance monitored by HM Inspectorate of \n 5 \nConstabulary through the Police Performance Assessment Framework (and since 2008 the Assessment of \nPolicing and Community Safety), the police went for the quickest and easiest wins or what various \ncommentators have referred to as \u2018low-hanging fruit\u2019 (Morgan, 2007; Farrington-Douglas with Durante, \n2009). Brian Paddick, a former Assistant Commissioner in the Metropolitan Police, described the situation in \nevidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee as follows: \n \nFor example, in terms of offences brought to justice, I am sure the Committee will realise that it is one \npoint on the score board for a complex case of murder which might take 18 months to investigate and six \nmonths to try in court, provided there is a conviction that counts as one offence brought to justice, and \na cannabis warning that takes 20 minutes to deal with on the street which counts as exactly the same \nunder current Home Office targets.4 \n \nA similar view of the impact of the targets was outlined by the Chief Inspector of Constabulary in the interim \nreport in his Review of Policing (Flanagan, 2007: 10)) in which he said:  \n \nThe recording and level of investigation of a vast swathe of minor crimes incidents (sic) is in my \nview, a key area that needs to be re-considered. This was raised in the majority of stakeholder \nsubmissions to the Review. An emphasis on sanction detection levels has undoubtedly to a degree \nproduced the unintended effect of officers spending time investigating crimes with a view to obtaining \na detection even when that is clearly not in the public interest. An example of such would be a low-\nlevel playground common assault. The sometimes inordinate amount of time spent by officers in \nsuch tasks could and should be channelled into more appropriate activity.5 \n \nIn this regard \u2018low-hanging fruit\u2019 may mean more than simply focusing on relatively easy offences \u2018brought to \njustice\u2019. There is also evidence  that  police activity has tended  disproportionately to be focused on the very \nyoungest age groups, and not just the most minor offences. A freedom of information request by the Institute \nfor Public Policy Research found that whereas between 2002 and 2006 there had been an approximately 10 \nper cent increase in adult OBTJ cautions and convictions, the increase was well over 25 per cent in relation \nto young offenders. Moreover, within the 10-17 age group, the increase in cautions and convictions of those \naged 10-14 was 35 per cent compared with 24 per cent for 15-17 year olds (Farrington-Douglas with \nDurante, 2009). Finally, any doubt about the vitally important role of managerial targets and incentives is \ndispelled by the Ministry of Justice explanation for the recent decline in the use of PNDs: it  coincided  \u2018with \ncriminal justice agencies being asked to focus on improving performance in bringing to justice crimes \ninvolving serious violent, sexual and acquisitive offences\u2019 (2010: 20). That is, put simply, the police and \nothers have, as a result of government instruction, shifted their focus away from \u2018low-hanging fruit\u2019.  \n \n                                                           \n4\n http:\/\/www.publications.parliament.uk\/pa\/cm200708\/cmselect\/cmhaff\/364\/36406.htm#n18 (accessed 20.1.11). Under \n18-year-olds are not eligible for warnings for possession of cannabis but the same argument applies for the out-of-court \npenalties for which they are eligible. \n5\n In his Final Report (2008: 56), Flanagan observed: \u2018The Home Office has realised the perverse incentives caused by \nsanction detection rates and Public Service Agreement 24 provides the opportunity to reduce the use of \u201coffences \nbrought to justice\u201d targets. The centre must ensure that these targets are not reinstated and AC PO must ensure that this \nbehaviour no longer manifests at force level. There are also further opportunities to look at the issues surrounding \nsanction detections.\u2019 \n 6 \nAmong the lessons we might draw from this experience, two are particularly pertinent. First, and so obvious \nthat it hardly needs saying, much of what happens to young people is dependent on decisions taken by the \npolice. A great many of these decisions involve the exercise of  substantial discretion, and often there will be \nan alternative to intervening formally. It makes sense, therefore, when seeking to limit resort to criminal \njustice sanctions, to start with the police. Second, and relatedly, it is  clear that  government targets can have \na dramatic effect. The extent to which young people are formally processed and drawn into the youth justice \nsystem has, in the past decade, been very significantly shaped by governmental diktat. There are clear signs \nnow that the retreat from some of the more egregious targets is having a substantial impact at least at the \nlower reaches of the criminal justice system. A similar pattern is visible in relation to one of the better-known \nrecent developments in the policing of youth misconduct: the anti-social behaviour order (ASBO). Introduced \nby the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, the use of ASBOs began significantly to increase  after their scope was \nexpanded by the Police Reform Act 2002 and again by the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003.  Since their \nintroduction a very sizeable proportion of ASBOs have been targeted at young people \u2013 somewhere \nbetween one third and two-fifths of the total (see Fig. B). \n \nFig. B: ASBOs imposed, 1999-2009, by age group (total number and as a proportion of total) \n0\n500\n1,000\n1,500\n2,000\n2,500\n3,000\n3,500\n4,000\n4,500\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\n10 to 17 18 and over\n \nSource: Home Office (2011a) \n \nMany concerns have been raised about the use of ASBOs, especially in relation to young people. The crucial \nones for my purposes here are those that focus on overly-hasty or excessive intervention in the lives of \nyoung people. They include the alleged failure to engage in such activities as home visits or agreeing \nacceptable behaviour contracts (ABCs) before imposing ASBOs, agreeing to unrealistic or inappropriate \nconditions, failing to address young people\u2019s support needs6 and, crucially, potentially \u2018widening  the net\u2019  by \nbringing young people into contact with the youth justice system and, most worryingly, increasing the number \nof young people in custody (Home Affairs Committee, 2005). In the  period  June 2000 to December 2009, a \ntotal of 221 children aged 12-14 received a custodial sentence for breaching their ASBO (or nearly 13 per \ncent of all ASBOs imposed on this age group). The average sentence imposed was six months. In the same \n                                                           \n6\n The Home Affairs Committee (2005: 123), for example, noted that, \u201cThere is a clear need for youth offending teams to \nbe involved in the response to young people who behave anti-socially\u2014especially when formal measures are used. \nWe were concerned to learn that Youth Offending Teams are not always consulted by those taking out an ASBO.\u201d \n 7 \nperiod, 1,111 young people aged 15-17 received custodial sentences for breach of their ASBO (20.6 per \ncent of all ASBOs imposed on this group) and the average sentence was 6.4 months (Home Office, 2011a).7  \nNow, as Fig. B. illustrates, rather like PNDs and cautions, though for somewhat different reasons, there has \nbeen a significant decline in the use of ASBOs  and the Coalition Government has signalled that their days \nare numbered.8 The crucial questions are what will replace them and what sort of lead will the Government \ngive to the police (and others) in responding to anti-social behaviour? Most importantly, and following the line \nof argument above, will there be sufficient political will to continue to reduce the numbers of young people \nsubjected to stop and search, reprimands and final warnings, penalty notices, ASBOs and the Criminal \nBehaviour Orders and Crime Prevention Injunctions that it is now proposed replace CRASBOs and ASBOs \n(Home Office, 2011b)? \n \nThe Future Shape of Police Politics \nRecent work by HMIC (HMIC, 2010) and by Cardiff University for HMIC (Innes and Weston, 2010) provides  \nsome possible pointers to future policing activity in this area. The Cardiff report, building on data which \nsuggests that the public make few consistent distinctions between ASB and crime when calling the police, \nsuggests that it is vital for public confidence that the police take seriously and respond to all reports of \nsignificant social harms, whether criminal or not. It proposes a problem-oriented and harm-focused approach \nto dealing with ASB. There are, however, a number of issues one might raise about this. First, in taking what \nit calls \u2018an avowedly victim- and citizen-focused approach\u2019 (2010: 10), based on what is considered to \u2018work\u2019 \nby \u2018ASB victims and the public\u2019, the report arguably presents an overly benign view of community views. \nCertainly existing research indicates that we should question such assumptions (Girling et al, 2000). Related \nto this, the government\u2019s proposed introduction of a \u2018community trigger for action\u2019 - where local agencies will \nbe compelled to take action if several people in the same neighbourhood have complained and no action \nhad been taken; or the behaviour in question has been reported to the authorities by an individual three \ntimes, and no action had been taken (Home Office, 2011b) \u2013 may be viewed as a welcome democratic shift \non the one hand, but also as a reform which carries the potential for ever-greater intervention in the lives of \nyoung people. Second, the report has relatively little to say about the nature of the powers used by the \npolice, and other agencies, or what the potential impact of such an approach might be on young people. \nAlthough the declining numbers of ASBOs \u2013 and other low level interventions with young people \u2013 are \nwelcome, sustaining them may be difficult. Crucially, therefore, any new initiatives in this field must be \naccompanied by careful controls and restrictions, perhaps underpinned by the form of joint inspection \narrangements advocated by the Independent Commission in relation to its other proposed reforms. \n \nIn the general territory of policing there are a number of changes likely to occur in the coming years which \nwe might anticipate will have an impact on the issues considered here. It is clear, for example, that the very \nsignificant reductions in local authority finance announced in 2010 will potentially jeopardise the ability of \ncouncils and the voluntary sector to maintain front-line diversionary and preventive activity. It is equally clear \nthat police budgets will shrink dramatically, a projected 20 per cent over the period 2011-15 (HM Treasury \n2010). It is difficult to anticipate what the impact of fiscal restraint will be. One can imagine very different \n                                                           \n7\n The average custodial sentence imposed on adult offenders in breach of the terms of their ASBO was 4.9 months. \n8\n \u2018Moving beyond the ASBO\u2019, speech by Teresa May, 28th July 2010, at http:\/\/www.homeoffice.gov.uk\/media-\ncentre\/speeches\/beyond-the-asbo (accessed 27.1.11) \n 8 \noutcomes. Budgetary restrictions might push the police in the direction of greater parsimony so far as \nintervening in the lives of young people is concerned: intervention is costly and competition for resources \nwithin the police service will undoubtedly be intense. On the other hand, one of the ways in which the police \nservice has traditionally sought to protect, or indeed increase, its budget has been by \u2018talking up\u2019 both the \ncrime problem and the police role in crime control.  Though the most recent crime statistics suggest that the \nincidence of crime has not yet been driven up by rising unemployment,  it nonetheless seems probable that \nthe greatly increased youth unemployment rate, which most labour market analysts anticipate getting worse9, \ncombined with other social tensions arising from the planned cuts in public expenditure, will mean that the \ndemands for service made on the police will likely increase. It remains to be seen whether the police are able \nsignificantly to reduce their costs (by merging or out-sourcing back-office functions, for example) without \nreducing visible, front-line policing. What is clear is that a question mark now hangs over the capability of \nfront-line policing teams comprising sworn officers and PCSOs to deliver the \u2018neighbourhood policing\u2019 which \nHMIC and independent research suggests is critical to maintaining public confidence (Jackson and Bradford, \n2009). Dedicated neighbourhood policing teams also comprise the persons arguably best equipped to \nexercise the diversionary decisions and deliver the restorative justice interventions which the Independent \nCommission recommends. Employing specialist, civilian RJ conference convenors on the Northern Ireland \nmodel would be both time-consuming and expensive, and in the current fiscal climate it is difficult to see \nwhere the funding for an addition to the youth justice infrastructure for these purposes would come from. A \nmore sensible approach might be to train neighbourhood policing teams to deliver restorative solutions and \nto reward the police for making greater use of these and other non-stigmatic non-criminal justice \ninterventions which the evidence suggests would better satisfy victims and reduce reoffending. \n \nIn this regard the invitation sent to all local authority chief executives alongside the December 2010 Green \nPaper (Ministry of Justice 2010b) and the provisions of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill \npublished at roughly the same time  opens up an intriguing possibility and an additional risk. The Green \nPaper announces that there are to be a small number of pilot projects based on consortia of local authorities \nworking in partnership who will be awarded  a \u2018reinvestment grant\u2019 to help them achieve reductions in the \nnumber of young people in custody from their areas (para. 257). The accompanying letter to local authority \nchief executives10 explains that those consortia successfully bidding for money will be allocated a grant \nwhich after a certain period of time they will be allowed to keep - providing the numbers of young people in \ncustody from their area have reduced by an agreed number. How this initiative is to be paid for is unclear \ngiven, as the government has made clear, there is no \u2018new money\u2019 on the table. The \u2018pathfinders\u2019 represent \nthe youth justice trial run for the \u2018payment by results\u2019 model which the Government commends generally. \nHow the desired outcome is achieved is for the local authority consortia to determine \u2013 a reflection of the \ndevolution and revived discretion approach which runs like  a leitmotif  through the Green Paper \u2013 but to \nhave any prospects of success they will need to have close working agreements with the police. For it is a \nmistake to see resort to custody as an issue concerning the relatively isolated top stratum of the youth justice \npyramid. The size of the top stratum is a function of the size of the whole pyramid. To reduce the top layer \n                                                           \n9\n See, for example, the report in the Financial Times on 19.1.11, http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/32a8c8c0-23b4-11e0-\n8bb1-00144feab49a.html#axzz1CcAnQnoT  \n10\n Letter dated 9 December, 2010 from Frances Done, Chairman, YJB, to all local authority chief executives concerning \nthe \u2018Youth Justice Reinvestment Pathfinder Initiative\u2019. \n 9 \none must consider the system as a whole, how many youths are drawn into it and, once drawn in, pushed \nthrough it. Reducing resort to custody means reducing resort to criminalisation and intervention at all levels. \nThe gatekeeping role of the police will be crucial as will the local authority precept be crucial to police \nbudgets under strain. Partnerships for collective parsimony seem on the youth justice cards. \n \nParsimony, however, requires a political context sympathetic to such ends. This brings us to the proposed \nchanges to police governance included in the current Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill. The \nprovision which has attracted most attention to date is that for directly elected Police and Crime \nCommissioners (PCCs) to replace police authorities. The Government\u2019s aim is to increase local democratic \naccountability and responsiveness in policing. One needs, however, to ask how this new arrangement for the \ngovernance of the police is likely to work? Who will likely stand for office? It is possible that one or two \n\u2018celebrity\u2019 candidates will be attracted but it is difficult to see how most candidates will achieve a sufficiently \nhigh profile to have any prospect of success without sponsorship by the major political parties. In which case, \non what basis will candidates campaign for office? Most likely is that they will seek to appeal to those \nsections of the electorate whose voices tend to be loudest on law and order matters: those who are older, \nmore affluent, least likely to live in high crime areas, and yet most anxious about youthful behaviour \n(Roberts, 2004).  If that proves to be the case the entry of PCCs to the politics of local policing may signal \nincreased pressure on the police to make greater rather than reduced use of their powers to criminalise \nyouth. These pressures may be particularly acute in urban areas where youth gang-related offences are \nmost troubling and which attract substantial mass media attention. This is speculative of course. However, \non the assumption that the emergence of these new political contests has at least the potential to lead to \ncalls for greater use of formal police powers in respect of youth crime and antisocial behaviour, it reinforces \nthe need to think carefully now about the principles upon which we would wish police activity in this area to \nbe governed and, if necessary, restricted.  \n \nConclusion \nWhilst I remain broadly in sympathy with both the underlying philosophy and the majority of the \nrecommendations made by the Independent Committee, my view is that without considering the role that the \npolice play in regulating the flow of young people into the justice system, any programme of reform is \nincomplete. More particularly, my argument is that we need to rehabilitate the idea of \u2018diversion\u2019 and, in \nparticular, to rescue it from the one-sided picture that became dominant from the mid-1990s onward. Smith \n(2010a), in his review of possible reforms, argues against any return to the practices associated with the \n\u2018diversionary interlude\u2019 of the 1980s, when there was a very substantial reduction in both convictions and \ncustodial sentences. His major charge against this \u2018interlude\u2019 is that it brought the system into disrepute and \nled to the backlash of the 1990s. Whilst quite a strong case can be made that \u2018repeat cautioning\u2019 was used \ninconsistently, perhaps inappropriately and too frequently \u2013 essentially the case made by the Audit \nCommission in Misspent Youth (Audit Commission, 1996) \u2013 it is more difficult to sustain the argument that \nthis was the direct cause of the punitive, political backlash of the 1990s onwards is more difficult to sustain. \nThe inconsistent and inappropriate use of discretion in youth justice may have been a partial spur to the \npunitive populism that gripped the politics of law and order from the early 1990s (see Downes and Morgan \n2007), the shifting politics of the time have far broader (beyond youth justice) and deeper (beyond issues of \ncrime and antisocial behaviour) roots (Garland, 2001).  \n 10 \n \nMy plea therefore is, whilst recognising the dangers of inappropriate or over-use, it is important not to lose \nfaith entirely in diversion \u2013 particularly for the youngest age groups. In this context, therefore, whilst there is \nmuch to be said for the Independent Commission\u2019s proposal to invest faith in \u2018triage\u2019 (Smith, 2010a: 389) - \npolice station-based assessments following which, it is argued, significant numbers of young offenders might \nbe diverted from criminalising measures \u2013 this still ignores the base of the youth justice pyramid. There still \nremains the question of how to limit the potentially negative consequences of all those informal, street-based \ncontacts between police and young people which can result in anything from an on-the-spot fine to a \nreprimand or even a final warning. All such \u2018formal\u2019 actions can be taken long before triage occurs within a \npolice station. The Independent Commission\u2019s aim of encouraging a continuing decline in the number of \nchildren and young people appearing in criminal courts and in custody, requires quite possibly radical \nreforms to the youth justice system, but is also needs action at an earlier point. As HM Chief Inspector of \nConstabulary put it, this is not to say that the police should have no role in relation to low-risk activity, \u2018but \nrather, a strong feeling that it can be dealt with in much more expeditious and indeed effective ways without \nhaving for example, the rest of the criminal justice system brought into action\u2019 (Flanagan, 2007: 10).   \n \nWhat all this raises is the important question of the proper limits to police discretion in connection with youth \ncrime and antisocial behaviour. The Edinburgh research cited earlier suggests that one of consequences of \nthe very wide discretion available to police officers in their dealings with young people was to create a \n\u2018permanent suspect population\u2019 which led, irrespective of later offending patterns, to enhanced police \ncontact. This targeting of particular young people had the potential to exacerbate a number of risk \nbehaviours amongst this population, including offending. In short, therefore, whilst there was some evidence \nof officers engaging in diversionary activities, it was also clear that one of the consequences of general \npolice practices in relation to many other young people \u2013 however unintentionally \u2013 was to ratchet up the \nlikelihood of the formal criminal justice intervention. By contrast, however, we might return to the recent \nexperience of the impact of extant government targets such as OBTJ where it can be argued that, by \nrestricting police discretion, encouragement was given to conduct which targeted, labelled and \u2018re-cycled\u2019 \n(McAra and McVie, 2010) particular groups of young people, resulting in an over-use of a wide range of low \nlevel interventions with, almost certainly, predictable consequences for these youngsters\u2019 future involvement \nwith the youth justice system. The challenge for policy-makers consequently remains one of designing \nsystems for constructive early intervention and prevention activity whilst avoiding the dangers of \nstigmatization and over-criminalization. The success or otherwise of such a system will very much depend \nupon the role of the police as first line of contact and as gatekeepers.   \n \n \n 11 \nReferences \n \nAye-Maung, N.
