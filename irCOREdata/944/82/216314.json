The present article empirically tests these claims by examining whether developing countries\u2019 linkages with more CO2- and SO2-efficient economies contribute to domestic improvements in CO2- and SO2-efficiency.

Introduction \n \nThe period since the 1970s has been one of intense globalization. Through rising levels of \ntrade, investment and telecommunications, countries have become increasingly \ninterconnected, integrated and interdependent. For critics, the growth of transnational \nlinkages has had negative environmental implications, particularly for developing \ncountries (Clapp, 2001, Mason, 1997, Moody, 2007, O'Brien and Leichenkob, 2000). \nHence, it is suggested that the incorporation of developing countries into the global \neconomy has forced governments into a competitive race-to-the-bottom, has led to the \ndevelopment of pollution havens, and the dumping of \u201cdirty\u201d technology on the global \nSouth. Advocates of globalization, on the other hand, tell a different story. They argue \nthat growing transnational linkages have accelerated the transfer and diffusion of \nenvironmentally-superior technologies, organizational practices and public policies to \ndeveloping countries (OECD, 1997, Wolf, 2004). Rather than a negative force, cross-\nborder connectivity has provided new opportunities for developing countries to \n\u201cleapfrog\u201d over the dirty stages of development, and to industrialize in more \nenvironment- and pollution-efficient ways (Goldemberg, 1998).1   \n Our contribution in the present article addresses this second set of claims. More \nspecifically, we examine whether transnational linkages contribute to improvements in \nthe pollution-efficiency2 of developing countries. Empirically, we focus on two \npollutants: carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2). These pollutants were \n                                                 \n1\n For the purpose of this article, we use the terms environment-efficient and pollution-efficient \ninterchangeably. \n2\n As such, our study says nothing about absolute measures of pollutant emissions, with improvements in \ndomestic pollution-efficiency simply indicating that countries are generating fewer emissions per unit of \neconomic production\/consumption. \n4 \nselected because they are two major sources of global environmental change: CO2 is the \nleading greenhouse gas (GHG) responsible for anthropogenically-forced climate change, \nwhile SO2 is one of the most important pollutants contributing to acid deposition (IPCC, \n2007).  \n A number of studies have investigated whether transnational connectivity, \ncommunication and exchange have been instrumental in lowering emissions (in absolute \nterms and\/or per unit of output) for these gases, reaching mixed results about the \ninfluence of cross-national linkages on domestic environmental performance (Grimes and \nKentor, 2003, Heil and Selden, 2001, Jorgenson, 2007, Mielnik and Goldemberg, 2002, \nPerkins and Neumayer, 2008). Our contribution advances on these studies in three areas. \nFirst, we examine three different forms of transnational linkage, namely: trade (imports \nand exports), inward foreign direct investment (FDI) and telecommunications. With the \nexception of Perkins and Neumayer (2008), previous studies have focused solely on the \nfirst two of these, and only in isolation (i.e. trade or investment, but not both). \nSecond, and most importantly, we use spatial lag variables to investigate the \ninfluence of all three forms of transnational connectivity on domestic pollution-efficiency \nin developing countries. Within the present context, these capture the pollution-\nefficiencies of foreign countries weighted by the degree of connectivity to these countries \nvia trade, FDI and telephone calls. Although one study has previously used spatial lags to \ninvestigate the influence of trade on domestic pollution-efficiency (Perkins and \nNeumayer, 2008), neither FDI nor telecommunications linkages have been investigated in \nthis way. Instead, studies have relied on geographically aggregated measures of cross-\nborder connectivity (total trade or FDI openness), which contain no information about \n5 \nlevels of pollution-efficiency in countries to which developing economies are linked. This \nis problematic: the domestic influence of cross-border linkages is not only likely to \ndepend on a developing economy\u2019s overall level of connectivity to other countries, but \nalso on the levels of environment-efficiency in the countries to which it is connected. By \ndistinguishing between linkages to countries which are more or less pollution-efficient, \nthe spatial lags deployed in the present article provide a more conceptually valid measure \nof the hypothesized influence of transnational linkages on domestic pollution-efficiency \nin developing countries. \n Third, we use a dataset for CO2 which runs up to 2005, the most recent year of \ndata available from the International Energy Agency (IEA). We therefore go beyond \nseveral previous studies whose samples have ended in 2000 or before, including our own \none which is closest in focus and design to the present article, Perkins and Neumayer \n(2008). Our more up-to-date sample is important in that we capture a period in history \nduring which developed economies began to invest more heavily in technologies (and \nassociated practices) to reduce carbon emissions \u2013 possibly influencing developing \ncountries to do the same. \n Our findings caution against some of the efficiency-oriented optimism voiced by \nsupporters of globalization and, specifically, those who point to the \u201cbeneficial\u201d influence \nof transnational linkages. Although higher pollution-efficiency in other countries are \nfound to spillover into improved domestic CO2 and SO2-efficiency if foreign pollution \nefficiency is weighted by import shares, neither exports, inward FDI nor telephone call \nlinkages appear to have any influence on domestic pollution-efficiency in developing \ncountries. The rest of the article is organized as follows: section 2 develops our \n6 \nconceptual framework; section 3 details our research design; section 4 present results; \nand section 5 provides conclusions and discussion.  \n \n2. Conceptualizing spillovers via transnational linkages \n \nThe idea that contact, communication and exchange underpin the geographic spread of \nnew innovations amongst members of a social system has long been recognized in \ntheories of diffusion (Rogers, 1995). More recently, similar ideas of connectivity have \nbeen deployed to argue that transnational linkages lead to the spread of environmentally-\nsuperior innovations to developing countries, which directly or indirectly contribute to \ndomestic improvements in environment-efficiency (Busch et al., 2005, Grubb et al., \n2002, Wallace, 1996). \nDirectly, improvements in environment-efficiency can come about through the \ncross-national diffusion of technological innovations, notably those with emissions lower \nthan existing technological configurations (Huber, 2008, Perkins and Neumayer, 2005, \nStern, 2002, 2005). Advances, particularly since the 1970s, have led to the development \nand deployment of a range of technologies which significantly reduce resource and \npollution-intensity. Thus, end-of-pipe (EOP) technologies have played an especially \nimportant role in abating SO2 emissions, while efficiency-enhancing innovations in \nprocess technologies have helped to reduce emissions of both CO2 and SO2.3 \nAccompanying these developments have been innovations in operating practices \u2013 \nranging from new, more efficient ways of operating machinery, through to environmental \n                                                 \n3\n Included within the suite of process-related technological changes has been fuel-switching to less \npollution-intensive energy sources (e.g. from coal to natural gas). \n7 \nmanagement systems (EMSs), which help firms to identify, plan and implement \nimprovements in environmental performance. \nTransnational linkages may also diffuse policy innovations, which by themselves \ndo not lead to improvements in environment-efficiency, but incentivise the domestic \nuptake of more environment-efficient performances, practices and technologies (Busch et \nal., 2005, Stern, 2007). Such policies include government environmental regulations, \nexpressly promulgated to address specific forms of environmental degradation (e.g. \nemission standards for SO2 to tackle terrestrial acidification). Less obviously, non-\nenvironmental policies may also play a role, altering the choices of domestic actors in \nways which lead to improvements in environment-efficiency. As an example: policies to \nliberalize energy markets have been known to improve CO2-efficiency in electricity \ngeneration by promoting a switch towards less carbon-intensive fuel types and more \nefficient plant designs (IEA, 2001).  \n The international spread of environmentally-superior innovations is likely to be \nespecially significant in the context of developing countries (Goldemberg, 1998, \nMarcotullio et al., 2005). The vast majority of these states have limited innovative \ncapacities and, with a handful of exceptions, little expertise in the development of more \nadvanced, environment-efficient technologies4. Improvements in domestic environment-\nefficiency are therefore likely to depend significantly on technology transfer from more \nenvironment-efficient economies (Perkins, 2003). Likewise, developing countries have \nalso lagged in the introduction of environmental regulations, limiting the incentives for \nthe adoption of such technologies. As such, the implementation of policies already \n                                                 \n4\n Yet it is nevertheless worth noting that certain developing countries have been active in innovating, \ncommercialising and manufacturing a range of environment-efficient technologies (e.g. solar collectors, \nwind turbines). \n8 \nadopted in more environmentally progressive states holds the potential to bring about \nsignificant improvements in environment-efficiency, albeit indirectly working through \nenvironmentally-superior technology and organizational practices (Hilton, 2006).    \nThe literature identifies two main ways in which transnational linkages accelerate \nthe cross-border spread of new innovations. One set of mechanisms centre on learning. \nThrough contact, communication and exchange, actors may come to learn about \ninnovations deployed elsewhere, together with their costs, benefits and feasibility \n(Simmons and Elkins, 2004). Along these lines, a sizeable literature has documented how \ncross-border learning has stimulated actors in one country to adopt innovations already \ndeployed elsewhere, whether for instrumental reasons (e.g. firms believe that a new \ntechnology will help to increase profits) or reputational ones (e.g. governments emulate \nthe environmental policies of more progressive states in order to avoid looking \nbackwards) (Drezner, 2001). Another oft-cited set of mechanisms centre on competition \n(Grubb et al., 2002, O'Neill et al., 1998). Transnational linkages potentially expose \ndomestic actors to competitive pressures which, directly or indirectly, stimulate the \nadoption of technologies, practices, policies and\/or performances similar to their \ncounterparts in other countries. For example, international competition from lower cost \nproducers of steel may encourage domestic firms in developing countries to invest in \nmore energy-efficient technologies and practices, such that they converge upwards in \nlevels of CO2-efficiency with their foreign counterparts (Perkins, 2007).  \n In practice, globalization is a multi-faceted process, and there are multiple ways in \nwhich any one developing country can be linked to any other set of countries. We focus \n9 \nhere on three broad and widely-discussed transnational linkages, created respectively by \ninternational trade, inward FDI and telecommunications. \n   \n2.1 International trade \n \nTrade has featured prominently in accounts of how worldwide economic integration can \ncontribute to environmental sustainability \u2013 particularly in developing countries (OECD, \n1997, Wolf, 2004). Core to the assumed importance of trade is its role in diffusing more \nmodern, environment-efficient technologies. Most obviously, international trade (via \nimports) allows developing countries to acquire more advanced, environmentally-\nsuperior technologies innovated in other countries, notably from economies with requisite \ndesign and\/or manufacturing competencies. As an example: a low-income country could \nimprove CO2-emission efficiency in its power sector by purchasing the latest, thermally-\nefficient plant designs from developed-country vendors.  \n Trade may also stimulate demand for more environment-efficient technologies in \ndeveloping countries. Through various social interactions created by imports and exports, \ndomestic firms may come to learn about new technologies. Indeed, businesses may pay \nparticular attention to the choices of their counterparts in export markets or in countries \nwhich have successfully penetrated the domestic economy via imports, both of which are \nlikely to serve as important \u201creference\u201d groups (O'Neill et al., 1998). Thus, domestic \nfirms may adopt a new technology because their foreign peers are doing so, fearing that \nthey may otherwise fall behind. More directly, price or quality competition from imports \nor in export markets may stimulate developing-country firms to upgrade their \n10 \ntechnologies to more modern designs, which embody higher levels of environment-\nefficiency (Grubb et al., 2002, Jenkins et al., 2002). Of course, there will be instances \nwhere competitive pressures will have precisely the opposite effect, incentivizing actors \nto reduce costs in ways that inhibit efficiency-enhancing capital investments (e.g. \npurchase of a new, more energy-efficient process unit) or operating expenditures (e.g. not \nrunning end-of-pipe sulfur devices). Yet, particularly for firms which compete with \nproducers from more environment-efficient economies, we believe these \u201cnegative\u201d \ndynamics are likely to be more than offset by the \u201cpositive\u201d ones of competition-driven \ntechnological modernization.  \n Trade has also been implicated in the diffusion of more progressive \nenvironmental policies which, in turn, stimulate investments in technologies which \nimprove environment-efficiency. Most famously, Vogel has hypothesized a \u201ctrading-up\u201d \neffect, whereby more stringent standards in high-regulating foreign markets spillover into \nlower-regulating jurisdictions via exports (Vogel, 1997). Typically, this is explained in \nterms of coercive supply-chain pressures from environmentally-demanding buyers, but \nscholars have also pointed to the importance of reputational motives (Drezner, 2001, \nPerkins and Neumayer, forthcoming).  \nRegardless, we argue that what is likely to be important is not only a developing \ncountry\u2019s overall volume of trade, but with whom it trades. Imports or exports with \npollution-inefficient countries are unlikely to spillover into significantly improved \ndomestic levels of environment-efficiency. Pollution-inefficient countries are likely to be \ncharacterized by dirty technologies, a low uptake of efficiency-enhancing organizational \npractices, and lax environmental regulations. The result: technology imported from these \n11 \ncountries will embody low levels of pollution-efficiency, there will be fewer \nopportunities to learn from (or otherwise be influenced by) efficiency-enhancing \norganizational practices and progressive environmental policies, and competitive \npressures for investments in more modern, efficient technologies will be lower.  \nPrevious statistical work lends considerable empirical weight to claims about the \nrole of trade in accelerating the spread of environmentally-superior technologies, \norganizational practices and public policies. A number of large-N, quantitative studies \nhave shown that more modern, environment-efficient technologies have diffused more \nrapidly in economies more open to international trade (Perkins and Neumayer, 2005, \nReppelin-Hill, 1999, Wheeler and Martin, 1992). Similarly, trade has been found to be \npositively correlated with the uptake of more progressive environmental policies, \nincluding those addressing air pollution (Frank et al., 2000, Popp and Lovely, 2008). \nStudies have also shown that if a country mainly exports to other countries with a high \nnumber of (potentially) efficiency-enhancing EMS standards (namely, ISO14001), this \ntends to spillover domestically into a higher number of EMS adoptions (Prakash and \nPotoski, 2006, Perkins and Neumayer, forthcoming). \nTurning to studies which have directly investigated the relationship between \nmeasures of trade and pollution emissions, Heil and Selden (2001) show that trade \nopenness is positively correlated with total CO2 emissions in developing countries; while \nLopez and Galinato (2005) finds mixed results for the influence of trade openness on \ndeforestation-derived carbon emissions, again in a sample of developing countries. \nNeither of the above studies distinguishes between trade with pollution-efficient and \ninefficient countries, uses emissions-efficiency as a dependent variable, or investigates \n12 \npollutants other than CO2. The one study that does these things, Perkins and Neumayer \n(2008), shows that developing countries where a greater share of imports are from CO2 \nand SO2-efficient countries have higher domestic pollution-efficiencies for these gases. \nYet the authors do not find a similarly statistically significant relationship between \nexports and domestic pollution-efficiency.  \n \n2.2 Foreign direct investment (FDI) \n \nThe idea that inward FDI is instrumental in the diffusion of environmentally-superior \ninnovations and performances rests on a set of claims about the direct and indirect effects \nof transnational corporations (TNCs) (Andonova, 2003, UNCTAD, 2007, Wallace, \n1996). Directly, it is suggested that transnationals often incorporate the latest, \nenvironment-efficient technologies in their investments in developing countries (OECD, \n1997). Many of the world\u2019s most advanced technologies \u2013 including those capable of \nimproving environmental-efficiency \u2013 are innovated, owned and operated by TNCs \n(UNCTAD, 2007). Moreover, transferring the latest technologies with high levels of \nenvironment-efficiency potentially allows TNCs to exploit their ownership-based \nadvantages over domestic competitors, e.g. an automobile with a modern, fuel-efficient \nengine characterized by high levels of embodied CO2-efficiency may command a price \npremium over domestic rivals, who only have access to lower performance, fuel-\ninefficient engine designs (Perkins, 2007). Adopting the same technologies through \nregional and\/or global corporate networks in both developing and developed countries \nmay also be more cost effective, e.g. it may be cheaper for an automobile TNC to \n13 \nmanufacture the same advanced, fuel-efficient engine for all its markets, rather than a \ndifferent design for each one. Further, implementing environment-efficient technologies \nin developing-country foreign affiliates and subsidiaries may reduce the risk of \nenvironment incidents, and damaging claims of \u201cdouble-standards.\u201d Similar points have \nbeen made about the propensity of developed-country transnationals to adopt beyond-\ncompliance corporate environmental standards, policies and organizational practices in \ndeveloping economies (Angel et al., 2007). \n Yet just as potentially significant as these direct effects from FDI are various \nindirect ones. A growing body of work has therefore speculated that the local presence of \nTNCs in developing countries may be instrumental in technological, organizational and \nenvironmental upgrading amongst domestic firms (Garcia-Johnson, 2000, Jeppesen and \nHansen, 2004, UNCTAD, 2007). Within this line of argument, it is suggested that foreign \ntransnationals may have a demonstrative effect, highlighting the existence, feasibility and \nbenefits of more modern, environment-efficient technologies, operating practices and \ncorporate voluntary standards (Huber, 2008). Domestic firms in developing countries \nmay emulate their foreign peers, adopting new technologies, operating practices, etc., \nwhich are seen as contributing to the success of TNCs. The local existence of TNCs may \nalso give rise to various knowledge spillovers, which facilitate the adoption, \nimplementation and replication of more advanced, environment-efficient technologies \namongst domestic firms, e.g. employees of a TNC subsidiary learn technological know-\nhow which they diffuse to local competitors through labor mobility (UNCTAD, 1999). \nTNCs may also give rise to new or enhanced competitive pressures which prompt local \nfirms in developing countries to take action to improve their competitiveness. Again, this \n14 \nmay involve investments in more modern technologies, operating practices and standards, \nwhich \u2013 because they embody higher levels of environmental performance as an integral \nfeature of their design \u2013 help to raise firms\u2019 environment-efficiency. \nIt is also possible that enhanced competitive pressures from TNCs may retard, or \nelse have limited effects in stimulating, efficiency-enhancing investments amongst \ncompetitors in the host economy. Hence, the presence of TNCs in the local market may \nreduce the profitability of domestic firms, limiting their willingness, ability and \npropensity to invest in more modern plant, equipment and operating practices. \nFurthermore, unable to compete on the basis of technology leadership, domestic firms \nmight pursue a cost minimization strategy, e.g. producing cars with older, less \nenvironment-efficient engine designs, but which are cheaper than those of their foreign \nrivals. Yet it is our belief that these are short-term dynamics and that, across the economy \nas a whole, competition from TNCs is more likely to raise than reduce a country\u2019s \nenvironment-efficiency. \n As with trade, we argue that the influence of foreign TNCs in developing \ncountries is likely to depend on its country of origin, with FDI inflows from more \nenvironment-efficient countries having a greater pollution-efficiency enhancing effect \nthan similar investment from less environment-efficient countries (c.f. Prakash and \nPotoski, 2007, Perkins and Neumayer, forthcoming). Although there will inevitably be \nexceptions, TNCs from less pollution-efficient countries \u2013 which presumably lag in terms \nof environmentally-significant technology and organizational practices \u2013 are less likely to \n\u201ctransfer\u201d efficiency-raising innovations to developing countries, and therefore impact \ndomestic pollution-efficiency. Nor, for the very same reasons, are they likely to stimulate \n15 \ndomestic upgrading in the direction of greater environment-efficiency via learning or \ncompetitive effects.  \nCompared to trade, however, empirical support for the assumed \u201cpositive\u201d role of \nFDI is far more mixed. Amongst the few large-N, quantitative studies which have \ndirectly investigated the links between aggregate FDI inflows and the uptake of more \nmodern, environment-efficient technologies, scholars have found little evidence of a \npositive relationship (Andonova, 2003, Perkins and Neumayer, 2005). Statistical research \nwhich has relied on geographically aggregated measures of FDI inflows has reached \nsimilar results when it comes to the spread of EMS standards (Neumayer and Perkins, \n2004, Prakash and Potoski, 2006).  \n More directly, Grimes and Kentor (2003) find inward FDI stock has a positive \neffect on absolute CO2 emissions in developing countries, while Jorgenson (2007) shows \na positive link in developing countries, albeit between primary sector total inward FDI \nstocks and the growth of CO2 emissions from agriculture. Again, based on an absolute \nmeasure of emissions, He (2006) estimates that Chinese provinces with a greater FDI \nstock have marginally higher levels of SO2 emissions. Turning to studies which focus on \nmeasures of pollution normalized by GDP, Mielnik and Goldemberg (2002) find that FDI \nand domestic CO2-intensity (i.e., the reverse of efficiency) is negatively correlated in \ndeveloping countries, although it is worth noting that their result derives from a simple \ncorrelation without control variables. Using a larger sample and an estimation model \nwhich features relevant control variables, Perkins and Neumayer (2008) find that FDI has \na positive and statistically significant impact on CO2 emissions-efficiency in developing \ncountries, but no statistically discernible influence on SO2. The present article advances \n16 \non these studies by using geographically disaggregated data to investigate the influence \nof inward FDI linkages on cross-national pollution-efficiency spillovers.  \n  \n2.3 Telecommunications  \n \nWhile much of the focus of recent statistical work has been on trade and, to a lesser \nextent, FDI, there is growing recognition that international telecommunications may also \nbe instrumental in diffusing environmentally-superior innovations \u2013 and, more broadly, \nperformances \u2013 across borders (Mol, 2006, Roberts and Thanos, 2003). Cross-border \ncommunications are another way in which developing-country firms might come to learn \nabout new, more environment-efficient technologies or associated organizational \npractices, innovated and deployed in other economies (Gong and Keller, 2003). This \nlearning may, in turn, stimulate domestic adoption of similar innovations by altering \nperceptions about their feasibility, financial payoffs and overall value. As an example: it \nis not implausible to suggest that firms located in developing countries which \ncommunicate intensively with more environmentally progressive states stand a greater \nchance of learning about, and possibly being influenced to adopt, environment-efficient \ntechnologies and organizational practices.  \nMore so than trade or FDI, cross-border communications might also play a role in \ngenerating domestic demand from civil society for environmental innovations and \nperformances found elsewhere. Through remote communications, citizens in developing \ncountries may come to learn about environmental technologies, practices, policies and \nperformances elsewhere, potentially creating new, or redefining existing, expectations \n17 \nregarding governments and firms. For example, on learning about stringent SO2 emission \nregulations adopted in countries with which they communicate more, organized elements \nin civil society may exert pressure on domestic politicians to match their foreign peers. \nAnecdotal evidence exists of such \u201clearning-by-comparison\u201d in public environmental \npolicy in developing countries, where civil society has called on their governments to \nadopt policies similar to those already deployed in more progressive, developed \neconomies, citing the experience of the latter as evidence of the feasibility of stringent \nregulations (Perkins, 2007, Rock, 2002).  \n The influence of telecommunications has received very little attention in the \nempirical literature. Using geographically aggregated data on international telephone \ntraffic, Wong (2004) shows that countries which communicate more with highly \nproductive economies enjoy higher rates of domestic productivity growth. Only one \nlarge-N, quantitative study has directly investigated the influence of telecommunications \non domestic environmental outcomes. Perkins and Neumayer (2008) show that \ndeveloping countries characterized by greater tele-connectivity \u2013 measured by the \nprincipal component of the number of internet users per capita and international \ntelephone traffic \u2013 enjoy a faster rate of improvement in domestic SO2-efficiency, but not \nCO2-efficiency. However, based on aspatial data, it remains unclear as to whether these \nresults hold when using geographically disaggregated data which captures levels of \npollution-efficiency in foreign countries with which countries communicate more \nintensively. \n \n3. Research design \n18 \n \n3.1 Dependent variable and sample \n \nThe dependent variable in our estimations is a country\u2019s pollution-efficiency, i.e. GDP \ndivided by emissions. Data for CO2 emissions is obtained from IEA (2007) and our \nsample covers the period 1980-2005. A lack of data means that our SO2 sample covers a \nshorter period, 1980-2000, with data taken from Stern (n.d.). Owing to the fact that our \ntelecoms data do not stretch as far back as 1980, the respective samples start in 1983 in \nthe regressions where the spatial lag with telecommunications as connectivity variable is \nincluded. GDP at exchange rates is known to underestimate effective purchasing power \nin lower-income countries. We therefore use GDP measured on a purchasing power \nparity (PPP) basis using data from IEA (2007). \nThe unit of analysis is the country year. Our estimations cover up to 98 \ndeveloping countries for CO2 and up to 92 countries for SO2, where the sample size is \ndetermined entirely by the availability of data for the dependent and explanatory \nvariables. After one of the current World Bank classification schemes, developing \ncountries are defined as all states which are not members of the Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The only exceptions are the Czech \nRepublic, Hungary, the Slovak Republic and South Korea which, although currently \nmembers of the OECD, we define as developing because they have been outside this \nhigh-income group for the largest part of our study period. \n \n19 \n3.2 Estimator \n  \nWe estimate the following model (i stands for country, t for time): \n \n(1) 1 1 2 1 1 3 4ln ln ln ln %it i it ikt kt it it t it\nk\ny y w y GDPpc indust u\u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b4\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n= + + + + + +\u2211  \n \nwhere yit is our dependent variable, i\u03b1  represent country-specific fixed effects, 1ln ity \u2212  is \nthe temporally lagged dependent variable, 1 1lnikt kt\nk\nw y\n\u2212 \u2212\u2211  represents the spatial lag \nvariable described in more detail below, itGDPpc  is a country\u2019s per capita income, \n% itindust  its industrial share of GDP, t\u03b4  represent year-specific fixed effects and itu  is \nthe error term. \nThe country-specific fixed effects account for unobserved country differences \ninfluencing domestic pollution-efficiency which do not vary, or vary very little over time, \nand which might be correlated with our explanatory variables. Included here are factors \nsuch as cultural differences which lead certain countries to exhibit greater normative \ncommitment towards environmental degradation or moral responsibility for the global \ncommons, as well as natural resource endowments, particularly of fossil fuels (e.g. see \nStern, 2005). The year-specific fixed effects capture time-specific global trends \ninfluencing emissions efficiency, e.g. growing worldwide awareness of the negative \nexternalities associated with CO2 and SO2. Country- and time-specific fixed effects are \nalso necessary to prevent spurious regression results for the spatial lag variables as they \n20 \naccount for unobserved spatial heterogeneity and common shocks and common trends \n(Pl\u00fcmper and Neumayer, forthcoming). \nWe estimate equation (1) with Arellano and Bond\u2019s (1991) dynamic generalized \nmethod of moments (GMM) instrumental variables estimator with robust standard errors. \nThis estimator is necessary because of the simultaneous inclusion of the temporally \nlagged dependent variable and country-specific fixed effects, which would cause Nickell \n(1981) bias in a simple fixed effects estimation. The Arellano and Bond estimator has the \nimportant advantage that the spatial lag variables can be explicitly specified as \nendogenous, i.e. their past and contemporaneous values are allowed to be correlated with \nthe error terms. The estimator works by first-differencing equation (1), which eliminates \nthe country-specific fixed effects, and by using past levels of the lagged dependent \nvariable and the endogenous variables lagged by two or more periods as respective \ninstruments. First-order autocorrelation in the original data is unproblematic, but the \nestimator depends on the assumption of no second-order autocorrelation in the first-\ndifferenced idiosyncratic errors. This can be tested and the test results fail to reject this \nassumption.  \n \n3.3 Spatial lag variables \n \nAs noted earlier, an important advance of the present study is to use spatial lags to \nestimate the influence of all three forms of spatial interdependence, i.e. interdependence \nworking via trade, FDI and telecommunications. The spatial lags allow us to investigate \nwhether higher levels of pollution-efficiency in other countries \u201cspillover\u201d domestically \n21 \nin terms of higher emissions-efficiency. Formally, a spatial lag variable is specified as the \nsum of the dependent variable in other countries (i.e. CO2 and SO2-efficency) weighted \nby a connectivity matrix, i.e. as 1ikt kt\nk\nyw\n\u2212\n\u2211 , where k represents all countries other than \ncountry i and 1iktw \u2212  measures the connectivity between country i and country k. In the \npresent article, we use four distinct spatial lag variables for our respective measures of \nconnectivity (i.e. imports, exports, FDI and telecommunications), each one comprising a \ndifferent connectivity matrix. The connectivity-matrix is row-standardized, i.e. the \nweights in each row sum to unity. Row standardization is commonly used in the literature \nand makes substantive sense for our analysis since our primary interest is the identity of \nthe major trade, investment and communication partners, and not the total exposure of \ncountries to related influences. We temporally lag our spatial lag variables by one year \nbecause it is unlikely that transnational linkages would have an instantaneous effect on \ndomestic pollution-efficiency.5 Note that the sample used for generating the spatial lag \nvariables comprises all countries, including developed ones, as otherwise they would \nonly capture diffusion among developing economies. \nThe trade connectivity matrix is constructed using UN (2008) data on bilateral \nmachinery and manufactured goods imports and exports. We create two separate spatial \nlag variables, one in which machinery and manufactured goods imports of country i from \ncountries k make up the connectivity variable, and another one in which exports from \ncountry i to countries k are used. After Perkins and Neumayer (2008), we restrict our \nfocus to machinery and manufactured goods, since they are far more likely to have a \nsubstantive influence on domestic CO2 and SO2-efficiency than other categories of \n                                                 \n5\n It is impossible to know the \u201ccorrect\u201d temporal lag length. If we temporally lag the spatial lag variables by \ntwo, three, four and five year lags, respectively, then results remain similar to the ones reported below. \n22 \nimports\/exports (e.g. foodstuffs). Machinery is involved in many (potentially) pollution-\nintensive processes and, furthermore, its environmental performance should plausibly be \naffected by international trade flows. For example, environment-efficient capital \nequipment (e.g. advanced, energy-efficient steel plant) imported by developing countries \nis likely to be instrumental in lowering domestic emissions per unit of output, especially \nif it substitutes for older, environment-inefficient technology. Trade in manufactured \ngoods might similarly have potentially significant implications for domestic \nenvironment-efficiency. Directly, imports of manufactured goods from more pollution-\nefficient countries (e.g. automobiles) embodying high levels of in-use environment-\nefficiency may contribute to reductions in domestic emissions. Indirectly, competition \nfrom more price and\/or quality competitive manufactured goods \u2013 whether from imports \nor in export markets \u2013 may stimulate domestic firms to upgrade their production and\/or \nproduct technologies, resulting in the adoption of more modern technologies with higher \nlevels of environmental performance.  \nOur second connectivity matrix, which captures the influence of foreign \ninvestment, is constructed using bilateral inward FDI stocks in country i originating from \ncountries k as the connectivity variable, with data from UNCTAD (2008). Unlike our \ntrade measure, data limitations mean that we are unable to restrict our analysis to \ninvestments in economic sectors most likely to influence pollution-efficiencies, e.g. \nelectricity generation, steel, etc. Still, our spatial lag with FDI as connectivity variable \nadvances on the geographically aggregated, total FDI based variables used in previous \nwork concerned with the link between foreign investment and pollution-\nefficiency\/intensity, in that it captures information on levels of pollution-efficiency in \n23 \ninvestor countries (Grimes and Kentor, 2003, Mielnik and Goldemberg, 2002, Perkins \nand Neumayer, 2008). We focus on FDI stocks. FDI flows data are frequently \ncharacterized by significant inter-annual variations and therefore provide a potentially \nmisleading measure of the overall influence of foreign investors on domestic technology, \norganizational practices and policy in any one year. \nOur final connectivity matrix specifies connectivity according to bilateral \ntelephone call traffic (in minutes) between country i and countries k, using data from \nTeleGeography (2007). Although these data have previously been used to explore cross-\nborder productivity spillovers (Wong, 2004), ours is (to the best of our knowledge) the \nfirst study to use this dataset to examine whether remote communications linkages \nbetween countries contribute to environmental spillovers.  \n \n3.4 Control variables \n \nWe additionally include three control variables in our estimations.6 First, using data from \nIEA (2007), we add GDP per capita in PPP to take account of the fact that wealthier \neconomies should plausibly have higher levels of pollution-efficiency. On the demand-\nside, economists have suggested that the environment is a normal good, in that demand \nfor environmental quality is likely to rise with per capita income (Grossman & Krueger, \n1995). A more sociological interpretation of these dynamics can be found in the work of \nInglehart (1977) who suggests that growing material affluence has led people to turn their \nattention towards post-materialist needs and values, including a greater concern for \nquality of life issues, such as environmental sustainability. Indeed, because wealthier \n                                                 \n6\n Results are very similar if we exclude the control variables from the estimation model. \n24 \npopulations are also typically better-educated, we might expect them to demonstrate \ngreater awareness, concern and engagement with environmental degradation. This will \ninclude issues such as future anthropogenic climate change, which people in wealthier \ncountries have not yet experienced directly, but may nevertheless have learnt about and \ndeveloped concern.  \nEither way, responding to popular concerns and demands, governments in \nwealthier countries are likely to adopt more stringent environmental regulations, while \nprivate firms should be more willing to engage in beyond-compliance initiatives to \nmanage their environmental performance. These predications are largely borne out by the \nempirical record, which shows that public and private commitment towards \nenvironmental protection rises with per capita income (e.g. Dasgupta et al., 2001, \nNeumayer and Perkins, 2004). \nOn the supply-side, domestic actors should be better-placed to be able to afford \nthe costs of purchasing modern, environment-efficient technologies, many of which are \nmore expensive on a capital-only basis (Perkins, 2003). Wealthier economies also have \nmore advanced technological capabilities. They are therefore likely to be better-placed to \ninnovate, manufacture and, of critical importance here, effectively implement, operate \nand maintain advanced, environment-efficient technologies. Note, the motives for \nacquiring and implementing these technologies may be non-environmental (e.g. to save \non energy costs), although they may deliver significant gains in environment-efficiency. \nAdding a variable for GDP per capita allows us to control for these income-related \ndifferences.   \n25 \n A second control variable is the share of industry (comprising mining, \nmanufacturing, construction, electricity, water and gas) in GDP. Industry is a major \nsource of CO2 and SO2 emissions such that more industry-intensive economies will, on a \nlike-for-like basis, have proportionately lower levels of pollution-efficiency for these \ngases. By controlling for industry share, we are better able to isolate the influence of \nstructural differences (which are not of central concern here) from differences in the state \nof technology and organizational practices (which are of direct concern), and therefore \nreduce the likelihood of generating spurious findings.7  \n Third, we include a temporally lagged dependent variable, which controls for the \npossibility of (conditional) convergence in pollution-efficiency, i.e. countries with low \nlevels of domestic CO2 or SO2-efficiency might well improve their pollution-efficiency \nfaster than countries with high levels of pollution-efficiency, such that the pollution-\nefficiencies of different countries should converge over time.8 Conceptually, cross-\nnational convergence is likely because gains in domestic pollution-efficiency are \ntypically easier, cheaper and quicker to achieve where the baseline efficiency is low, e.g. \ntechnologically lagging countries can take advantage of efficiency-enhancing learning \ninvestments made by leading countries (Marcotullio et al., 2005; Perkins and Neumayer, \n2005; Stern, 2007). \n \n                                                 \n7\n The results are very similar if we exclude these two control variables. The spatial lag with exports as the \ntransnational linkage variable becomes statistically significant if entered on its own for both CO2 and SO2-\nefficiency, but only the spatial lag with imports as the transnational linkage variable is significant if the \nspatial lags are entered simultaneously into the estimations. \n8\n The convergence is called conditional since it is conditional on the other explanatory variables. Formally, \nthere is evidence for conditional convergence if the coefficient of the lagged dependent variable for CO2 \nand SO2-efficiency minus one is statistically significantly negative. \n26 \n4. Results  \n \nTables 1 and 2 show our results for CO2 and SO2-efficiency, respectively. We first enter \neach spatial lag separately and then all spatial lags combined in one model. The results \nprovide only mixed support for the role of transnational linkages in fostering cross-border \nspillovers of pollution-efficiency into developing countries. We find that our spatial lag \nworking via import linkages has a positive and statistically significant effect on levels of \ndomestic pollution-efficiency for both CO2 and SO2. That is, our results indicate that the \nmore CO2 and SO2-efficient foreign countries from where a particular economy mainly \nimports its machinery and manufacturing goods, the higher are domestic levels of \npollution-efficiency for these gases in the importing country. The result is the same \nregardless of whether this spatial lag is entered separately into the regressions or in \ncombination with the other spatial lags. \n<<INSERT TABLES 1 and 2 ABOUT HERE>> \n Yet we fail to find the same result for exports. Our spatial lag based on exports as \nconnectivity variable is statistically insignificant for both CO2 and SO2. We also find that \nneither FDI inflows nor telephone call linkages appear to act as conduits for cross-border \nspillovers of environmental efficiency. In both sets of regressions (i.e. where they are \nentered individually or in combination with the other spatial lag variables), the spatial \nlags working via inward FDI and telephone calls as connectivity variables have no \nstatistically discernable influence on levels of domestic CO2 or SO2-efficiency in \ndeveloping countries. \n27 \n Finally, we turn to the control variables. As expected, GDP per capita is \nsignificantly positively correlated with both CO2 and SO2-efficiency in all but one of the \nestimations, most likely reflecting the greater awareness of environmental externalities in \nwealthier economies, greater demand for environmental quality, and an enhanced ability \nto respond to these concerns and demands. Also in line with expectations, the estimated \ncoefficient for share of industry in value-added is negative and statistically significant, \nwith one exception. Finally, as expected, we find evidence for conditional convergence in \nthat the coefficients of the temporally lagged dependent variable for CO2 and SO2-\nefficiency minus one are statistically significantly negative throughout.9 \n \n5. Conclusions and discussion  \n \nIn recent debates, advocates of neo-liberal reform have tended to steer-clear of (absolute) \nscale-effects in discussing the environmental implications of globalization in developing \ncountries. Instead, they have preferred to focus on (relative) metrics of eco-efficiency, \narguing that transnational contact, communication and exchange can enhance the \nefficiency with which countries utilize the environment to generate economic output, \neither as a source or sink. Our intervention in the present article empirically scrutinizes \nthis efficiency-oriented optimism by examining whether developing countries\u2019 linkages \nto other countries impact on domestic pollution-efficiency for these important sources of \nglobal environmental change. \n                                                 \n9\n This cannot be directly observed from tables 1 and 2, but follows from the confidence intervals of the \nestimated coefficients.  \n28 \n Our results provide only mixed support for the alleged environment efficiency-\nenhancing effect of transnational linkages in the context of developing countries. Only \none of our constructs of global connectivity and interdependence emerges as a \nstatistically significant predictor of domestic pollution-efficiency. Hence we find that the \nmore environment-efficient the countries from which a developing country mainly \nimports its manufactured and machinery goods, the higher domestic levels of pollution-\nefficiency for these gases. However, if the developing country exports machinery and \nmanufactured goods to more pollution-efficient economies, this has no statistically \nsignificant influence on either domestic CO2 or SO2-efficiency.  \n Although Perkins and Neumayer (2008) reached a broadly similar result, our \nfinding for exports is nevertheless surprising. One possible explanation for the \ndiscrepancy is that, while countries may \u201cimport\u201d high levels of embodied environmental \nperformance by acquiring capital and manufactured goods from pollution-efficient \ncountries, no equivalent mechanism exists in the case of exports. Also, while many \ndeveloping countries predominantly import high value-added goods (e.g. capital items, \ntechnologically-advanced manufactures), they largely export low value-added goods (e.g. \ntextiles, foodstuffs). Within developed-economy exports markets, customers are unlikely \nto be greatly concerned about CO2 or SO2 emissions generated during the production of \nlow-value goods, nor about their in-use emissions which tend to be comparatively \ninsignificant. Hence our findings might be explained by the different structure of imports \nand exports. Another possible explanation is that the efficiency-enhancing effect of \nimports \u2013 especially via competitive effects \u2013 is more diffuse because it potentially \naffects all domestic firms in a particular sector. Conversely, exports are only likely to \n29 \nstimulate efficiency-enhancing upgrading amongst firms who market their goods in \npollution-efficient countries, which may not include all industry participants. In the \nabsence of further research, however, we cannot say with any certainty which one \u2013 or \nindeed combination \u2013 of these possible explanations accounts for the result. \n Another interesting result is that the pollution-efficiencies of a developing \ncountry\u2019s major source countries of inward FDI stocks do not affect domestic CO2 and \nSO2-efficiency. This goes against many assumptions about the role of TNCs as carriers of \nenvironmentally-superior innovations to lower-income countries, raising questions about \nwhether FDI from more pollution-efficient economies actually has an environment-\nefficiency enhancing effect. Of course, it could be that our inclusive, all-sector measure \nof FDI is too broad to capture the hypothesized substantive influence of TNCs, which is \nmost likely to arise in the context of pollution-intensive sectors. Unfortunately, sectorally \ndisaggregated bi-lateral FDI data with wide geographic coverage do not exist, meaning \nthat we cannot test this thesis.  \n Yet sectoral effects are unlikely to explain the discrepancy between our result for \nFDI and previous, large-N work which has found that inward FDI is associated with \nhigher levels of CO2-efficiency (Mielnik and Goldemberg, 2002, Perkins and Neumayer, \n2008). Instead, these differences are most likely rooted in the distinctive way in which \nthese respective studies have modeled and measured FDI.  Hence past \u201cpositive\u201d findings \nhave been based on aggregate measures of FDI stock\/flows and therefore capture the \nrelationship between overall levels of connectivity to all other countries and domestic \nenvironment-efficiency. Conversely, our study does not capture countries\u2019 overall \nconnectivity, but rather levels of environment-efficiency in other countries weighted by \n30 \nthese respective countries\u2019 share of total inward FDI stocks. Therefore, previous studies \nand the present one measure two different aspects of the same phenomenon, suggesting \nthat it would be wrong to conclude that the results of the former are spurious. We would \nbe inclined towards placing greater store on our findings, since they derive from an \nanalytical model and measure which better represents theoretically-derived causal \nmechanisms hypothesized to account for cross-border environmental spillovers, i.e. \naccounting for the fact that inward FDI from pollution-efficient countries should \nplausibly have a greater influence on domestic pollution-efficiency than FDI from \npollution-inefficient countries. However, we cannot discount the possibility that what \nmatters in raising domestic environment-efficiency is the overall volume of FDI, rather \nthan higher levels of environment-efficiency in investing economies. \n We similarly draw a blank when it comes to telecommunications. As with exports \nand inward FDI, our econometric estimations suggest that pollution efficiencies in a \ndeveloping country\u2019s major telecommunication partner countries do not affect domestic \nlevels of domestic CO2 and SO2-efficiency. This does not necessarily mean that cross-\nborder telecommunications play no role in diffusing environmental innovations and \nperformance. Besides, our measure of cross-border communications is a broad one, \nfailing to capture specific geographic patterns of communication between those actors \nwhose interactions are most likely to contribute to environmental spillovers, e.g. \ngovernment bureaucrats, powerful environmental NGOs, etc. A challenge for future \nresearch will be to (re-)investigate the influence of remote communications using more \nrefined data for policy-relevant actor-networks. \n31 \n Two broader lessons emerge from this research. One is that we must be cautious \ntowards generalized claims about the environmental benefits of transnational linkages, \nconnectivity and exchange. In our study, being connected to foreign countries via imports \nof machinery and manufacturing goods appears to act as a conduit for the diffusion of \npollution-efficiency into developing countries for two key pollutants implicated in global \nenvironmental change. Yet the fact that neither linkages via exports, inward FDI nor \ntelephone calls have an influence on domestic pollution-efficiency in our research raises \nquestions as to whether all forms of global linkage systematically have an unambiguously \n\u201cpositive\u201d influence in developing countries.  \n Another lesson is methodological. Much of the large-N, statistical literature which \nhas investigated the role of transnational linkages in the diffusion of environmental \ninnovations and performance has done so in an aspatial manner. Studies have ignored the \nspecific geometry of cross-border linkages, relying instead on aggregate measures of \nexposure to external influences. Our research suggests that the way in which researchers \nspecify \u201cglobalization\u201d may have significant implications for our understanding of its \nenvironmental implications. Revealing here are the differences between the findings of \nthe present article, which uses spatial lags, and our previous work, which mainly makes \nuse of aggregate measures of connectivity (Perkins and Neumayer, 2008). These \ndisparities serve as a reminder that analysts\u2019 research design and specification can have a \nmajor influence on the inferences that they derive regarding the anthropogenic dynamics \nof global environmental change.  \n   \n  \n32 \nReferences \n \nAndonova, L.
