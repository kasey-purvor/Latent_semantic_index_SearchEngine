Doi: 10.1016\/j.socscimed.2008.06.022Metadata only entryIn line with the increasing emphasis on informed choice, women invited for cervical cancer screening in England receive a leaflet containing information on the risk factors and causation of the condition. However, data from a qualitative interview study with 35 women suggest that the ways in which women make sense of this information can vary and frequently do not correspond to the causal pathways and explanations which characterise contemporary professional medical explanations.
