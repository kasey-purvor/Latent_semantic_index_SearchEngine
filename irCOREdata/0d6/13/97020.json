Let us first recall some of their well-\nknown properties (cf. [3], [12]). When a sufficiently large stress is applied, these\ndislocations glide along the crystallographic planes of the crystal and interact with\nother dislocations they find on their way. In addition, new dislocations are observed to\nbe generated at certain nucleation sites. As a result they appear typically in very large\nnumbers (1012 dislocations\/cm2 in heavily worked metals) and modify the mechanical\nproperties of the material. In particular, dislocations are thought to control the plastic\nproperties of crystalline solids (at low temperature).\nIt is well known that, under an applied stress, crystals deform elastically up to a\ncritical value of this stress, known as the yield stress. For higher stresses, the deforma-\ntion becomes plastic (irreversible) and ends up eventually in fracture. The yield stress\nis thought to be the stress at which large numbers of dislocations start moving. Once\nin the plastic regime, the generation, motion, and interaction of dislocations results in\nthe formation of complicated networks of defects in the microscopic structure of the\nmaterial. When these networks are so dense that dislocations cannot move freely, the\ncrystal hardens (work hardening). This effect is very important when working with\nmetals, since heavily worked metals are stronger than unworked metals.\nDislocations can be described in many different ways, depending on the length-\nscale on which they are viewed. At the microscopic level, they appear as defects in the\ncrystalline lattice. Then, if the separation between dislocations is not too small, there\nis a mesoscopic scale at which the dislocations may be modelled as line singularities\nof the elastic stress evolving in a continuous material [6]. Finally, at a macroscopic\nscale containing large numbers of dislocations we can think in terms of a continuous\ndislocation density.\n\u2217Received by the editors November 22, 1999; accepted for publication (in revised form) December\n15, 2000; published electronically May 16, 2001.\nhttp:\/\/www.siam.org\/journals\/siap\/61-6\/36434.html\n\u2020Departamento de Matematica Aplicada, Universidad Complutense, Madrid 28040, Spain\n(ana\u2212carpio@mat.ucm.es, velazque@sunma4.mat.ucm.es).

Many numerical simulations of these types of models have been carried\nout (see, for instance, [4], [14], [17]). At the mesoscopic scale, models for the evolution\nof the line singularities can be written down and rules chosen for their interaction.\n(Ideally these rules would come from an analysis of the microscopic scale through\nsome asymptotic limit; such an analysis has yet to be carried out successfully, and\nlaws of motion and interaction are often taken from experimental observations.) Such\nmodels have been simulated numerically in [7].\nOne goal of this paper is to formulate models for the dynamics of macroscopic\ndensities of dislocations. Several models involving densities of dislocations in different\nframeworks have been developed in [1], [11], [13]. We are concerned here with a\ncommon process experimentally observed in worked materials that is the formation\nof a honeycomb of regions of high and low dislocation density, as dislocations on\ndifferent slip planes interact and tangle up, effectively pinning each other. One of our\nprime motivations in this work is to try to determine the simplest model of dislocation\ninteraction which will exhibit this pattern formation.\nWe introduce two types of models. The first are systems of conservation laws\nof changing type (they may be either strictly hyperbolic, or nonstrictly hyperbolic,\nor elliptic in different regions). The onset of nonstrictly hyperbolic regions creates a\nnumber of difficulties, since, from the mathematical point of view, the initial value\nproblem may be ill-posed.\nThe second are regularizations of these systems by terms involving higher deriva-\ntives, which we expect to have a smoothing effect. In this case we are led to the study\nof free-boundary problems with vanishing dissipation.\nDespite their simplicity our models exhibit instabilities due to the loss of strict\nhyperbolicity in the equations, which should lead to such pattern formation. They\ncan also describe some typical dislocation patterns, such as dislocation pile-ups. We\nfind that these structures can arise when a moving family of dislocations meets a high\ndensity of some other family of dislocations on its way. This \u201cbarrier\u201d of dislocations\nmakes glide difficult so that the moving dislocations get stuck and pile up.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In the next section we propose the models.\nIn section 3, we study some solutions showing pile-up formation for the degenerate\nsystems of conservation laws by methods of characteristics. In section 4 we construct\npile-up solutions for the regularized models by solving rigorously some free-boundary\nproblems with small viscosity . We also study their limiting behavior as the regulariz-\ning terms tend to zero in section 5 using formal asymptotics. Finally, some technical\npoints are analyzed in a detailed way in several appendices at the end of the paper.\n2. The models. Details of the structure of dislocations can be found in any\nbook on the field (see, for instance, [3], [12]). In general, they may be characterized\nby their tangent vector and a microscopic parameter known as the Burgers vector,\nwhich measures the form of the local mismatch in the crystal lattice.1 The canonical\ncases for rectilinear dislocations are to have the Burgers vector parallel to the tangent\nline (screw dislocations) or perpendicular to it (edge dislocations). More complex\ncurved dislocations can be described as combinations of these elementary types.\n1If we think of the dislocation as being created by a cut-and-weld operation, that is, by slicing a\nperfect crystal along a semi-infinite plane bounded by the dislocation line, moving the material on\none side of this plane relative to the other, and then welding the two sides together again, then the\nBurgers vector gives the relative displacement of the two halves before rejoining.\n2170 A. CARPIO, S. J. CHAPMAN, AND J. J. L. VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ\ndislocation\nin the y\ndirection\nx\nz\nBurgers vector\nFig. 2.1. Edge dislocation.\nTypically, it is energetically more favorable for a dislocation to \u201cglide\u201d in the slip\nplane spanned by its tangent and Burgers vectors, rather than to \u201cclimb\u201d out of this\nplane [3]. In this paper, since we are looking at very simple models, we will restrict\nour analysis to the interaction of edge dislocations in a cubic crystal. In Figure 2.1\nwe show a cross section of a typical edge dislocation, along with its Burgers vector.\nWe obtain a model for the interaction of two families of edge dislocations. We take\nthe first family to be tangent to the z-direction and Burgers vector in the x-direction,\nand the second family to have tangent in the y-direction and Burgers vector in the\nx-direction. Thus, the first family has the xz-plane as its slip plane, while the second\nfamily has the xy-plane as its slip plane, and if we assume that the dislocations\nremain rectilinear then both families will glide in the x-direction [3]. We refer to\nthem as \u201cdislocations type 1\u201d and \u201cdislocations type 2,\u201d respectively. By symmetry\nconsiderations, the problem can be reduced to a one-dimensional problem (see [5] for\nmore details on the modelling), giving two populations with densities w1(x, t) and\nw2(x, t), respectively. We want to determine how these density profiles evolve with\ntime.\nConservation of dislocations for both families yields\n\u2202w1\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(w1v1) = 0,(2.1)\n\u2202w2\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(w2v2) = 0,(2.2)\nwhere vi is the velocity of family i.\nTo close the model we need a law relating the speed of the dislocations to the\nexternal forces and the densities.\nDislocations move in their slip plane in response to the component \u03c3ijbimj of the\napplied stress (the so-called Schmid factor [12]), where b is the Burgers vector and\nm is the normal to the slip plane. Thus dislocations in the first family will move\nin response to \u03c312 while those in the second family will move in response to \u03c313. It\nhas been experimentally observed (cf. [10]) that the speed of dislocations grows as a\npower law of the applied stress. Then, in the absence of any interaction between the\nfamilies we would close the model with velocity laws such as\nv1 = sign(\u03c312)|\u03c312|\u03b3 ,\nv2 = sign(\u03c313)|\u03c313|\u03b3 ,(2.3)\nwhere any constant of proportionality may be set equal to unity through a suitable\nrescaling of time.\nPILE-UP SOLUTIONS FOR CONSERVATION LAWS 2171\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0001\n\u0001\nfamily 2\ndislocation of dislocation of \nfamily 1\n\u03b8\n\u03c3\nR\nT\nR\nd\n12\n2\n1\n1\n1\nFig. 2.2. Dislocations of the first family pinned by those of the second family.\nIn fact, if the applied stress is smaller than a critical threshold (the Peierls stress)\nthen dislocations remain at rest. The speed laws (2.3) are applicable if the applied\nstresses are large compared with the Peierls stress, which is usually the case, since for\nmany materials the Peierls stress is small.\nNote that sheets of edge dislocations generate no stress of their own so that \u03c312\nand \u03c313 here are just the applied external stresses, which are independent of x but\nmay be dependent on time. In our setting, the first family of dislocations can be seen\nas a set of lines parallel to the y-axis, and the second family is another set of lines\nparallel to the z-axis. Both families move along the x-axis. However, as dislocations\nfrom the first family move they must cut through the dislocations of the second family.\nWe suppose that there is a strong resistance to this cutting. Suppose first that the\ndislocations in the second family are held fixed. Then for small values of \u03c312 the\ndislocations in the first family will not cut those of the second family, but will form\narcs of circles between the pinning dislocations of this family as in Figure 2.2 (such\ninteractions are often known as \u201cforest\u201d interactions).\nThe classical theory of dislocations establishes the existence of an elastic energy\nas well as an associated \u201cline tension\u201d associated to each dislocation (cf. [3]). The\ndriving force of the applied stress is then balanced by the curvature induced restoring\nforce, T\/R1, due to the \u201cline tension,\u201d T , in a dislocation, where R1 is the radius of\ncurvature. Thus, we have\n|\u03c312| = T\nR1\n.(2.4)\nHowever, there is a minimun value of R1 the dislocation can attain while still\npassing through the pinning sites. For sufficiently large applied stresses neighboring\narcs of circles will meet tangentially at the pins, and may reconnect so that the pins\nhave been traversed, as in Figure 2.3.\nThis happens when the curvature of the dislocation reaches the value 2\/d2, where\nd2 is the distance between dislocations of the second family. Thus we expect the second\nfamily to generate a pinning force on the first family proportional to\n\u221a\nw2 (since this\nis proportional to (d2)\n\u22121). Applying this argument to both families independently we\nwere led in [5] to consider the velocity laws\nv1 = sign(\u03c312)\n(\n(|\u03c312| \u2212 a\u221aw2)+\n)\u03b3\n,(2.5)\nv2 = sign(\u03c313)\n(\n(|\u03c313| \u2212 a\u221aw1)+\n)\u03b3\n,(2.6)\nwhere a = 2T may be taken as a parameter.

We will use the speed laws (2.5), (2.6) to close system\n(2.1), (2.2) in this paper.\nAlthough the resulting model reproduces some interesting dislocation patterns,\na more realistic model should assume that both families of dislocations are curved,\nnot just one of them. More precisely, in allowing each family to pin the other we\nmust not fix one family when calculating the pinning effect it has on the other, but\nallow it to be \u201cdragged along\u201d; we must perform an overall force balance rather than a\nseparate force balance for each family. Thus we are led to consider the situation shown\nin Figure 2.4, which is a three-dimensional version of Figure 2.2, in which we have\nrepresented both families of dislocations and their mutual interaction. Cutting Figure\n2.4 across planes perpendicular to one of the families we obtain pictures analogous to\nFigure 2.2.\nNow a local force balance at the crossing points gives that \u03b81 = \u03b82 assuming that\nthe line tension in both dislocations is the same, where \u03b81 is the jump in the angle\nof the tangent vector of a dislocation of family i at the crossing point (see Figures\n2.2, 2.4). Hence d2\/R1 = d1\/R2. If there is no cutting the dislocations must move\nwith the same velocity. Using (2.4) and the analogous one for the second family of\ndislocations we obtain\n\u03c312 \u2212 \u03c313 = T\n(\n1\nR1\n+\n1\nR2\n)\n.\nWe are assuming here that the dislocations deform as in Figure 2.4. This gives\nR1 =\nT\n(\u03c312 \u2212 \u03c313)\n(d1 + d2)\nd1\n,(2.7)\nR2 =\nT\n(\u03c312 \u2212 \u03c313)\n(d1 + d2)\nd2\n.(2.8)\nPILE-UP SOLUTIONS FOR CONSERVATION LAWS 2173\nInserting these values in (2.4) and in the analogous law for family two, the speed of\nthe dislocations can be expressed as\nv1 = v2 = sign\n(\nd1\u03c313 + d2\u03c312\nd1 + d2\n) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223d1\u03c313 + d2\u03c312d1 + d2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03b3\n,(2.9)\nwhere the dislocation separations are related to the dislocation densities by\nw1 =\n1\nd21\n, w2 =\n1\nd22\n.(2.10)\nSuch a situation can hold so long as there is no cutting, i.e., R1 <\nd2\n2 and equivalently\nR2 <\nd1\n2 .

Our aim will be to see how the presence of a (nonuniform)\ndistribution of pinning \u201ctrees\u201d will affect the motion of a family of dislocations, and\nin particular how it may lead to a dislocation pile-up.\nWe will find that the simple model we have formulated may be ill-posed in some\nregions of parameter space and may develop singularities. This is because, as men-\ntioned earlier, pure sheets of edge dislocations generate no stress to leading order, so\nthat there is no repulsion mechanism preventing infinite dislocation densities. Because\nof this, we will also study a simple regularized model in which we include a small force\non the dislocations proportional to the gradient of the density, which will model the\nhigher order repulsion effects of sheets of edges and will smooth out the singularities\npresent in the original model. Thus we will set\n\u2202w1\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\nw1\n((\n\u03c312 \u2212 a\u221aw2 \u2212 \u0018\u2202w1\n\u2202x\n)+)\u03b31)\n= 0,(2.14)\nwhere we have assumed without loss of generality that \u03c312 is positive.\nOur regularization here is rather \u201cad hoc\u201d; we have made this choice because it\nis a simple mathematical law that yields a local model and reproduces the expected\nself-repulsion between dislocations of the same type. It would be nice to calculate\nthe higher order correction terms when passing from a discrete dislocation model to\nthe dislocation density model (which may be nonlocal), and to check if they can be\napproximated in some limit by the second order terms in (2.14).\n2174 A. CARPIO, S. J. CHAPMAN, AND J. J. L. VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ\n3. Pile-up solutions for the system of conservation laws.\n3.1. Remarks on stability and well-posedness. From now on, we assume\nthat the applied stresses are independent of time. We are concerned here with finding\nsolvability conditions for (2.1)\u2013(2.2) with either (2.5)\u2013(2.6) or (2.9)\u2013(2.13).\nFirst of all let us check whether the system is hyperbolic by computing the Jaco-\nbian of the flux. With U = (w1, w2)\nt we have\nUt + (F (U))x = Ut +DF (U)Ux = 0,\nwhere F (U) = (w1v1(w2), w2v2(w1))\nt so that\nDF (U) =\n(\nv1(w2)\n\u2202v1(w2)\n\u2202w2\nw1\n\u2202v2(w1)\n\u2202w1\nw2 v2(w1)\n)\n.\nThe system (2.1), (2.2) is said to be strictly hyperbolic if DF (U) has two real distinct\neigenvalues \u03bb1, \u03bb2. If the eigenvalues are real and equal, the system is said to be\nnonstrictly hyperbolic. In both cases, the characteristic curves (solutions to \u03bb\u2032(s) =\n\u03bbi) are real. When the eigenvalues are complex, the characteristics are complex and\nthe system is said to be elliptic. The discriminant for the equation whose roots are\nthe eigenvalues is given by\n\u2206(w1, w2) = (v1(w2)\u2212 v2(w1))2 + 4w1w2 \u2202v2(w1)\n\u2202w1\n\u2202v1(w2)\n\u2202w2\n.(3.1)\nFor either (2.5)\u2013(2.6) or (2.9)\u2013(2.13), \u2206(w1, w2) may be positive or negative in dif-\nferent regions of the (w1, w2) plane. Therefore, our system is of mixed type. Figures\n3.1 and 3.2 show the change of type in the system when \u03b3i = 1 for (2.5)\u2013(2.6) and\n(2.9)\u2013(2.13), respectively. Notice that the elliptic region for (2.5)\u2013(2.6) appears only\nwhen the speeds of both families of dislocations have opposite sense. Let us also point\nout that in the nonstrictly hyperbolic region this model reduces to the trivial system\n\u2202w1\n\u2202t = 0 =\n\u2202w2\n\u2202t . This is due to the existence of threshold values for the stresses below\nwhich the speeds are zero.\nhyperbolic\nhyperbolic\nelliptic\nww\nw\nhyperbolic\nw\n1\n2\n1\n2\nsign( sign(\u03c3   ) sign(\u03c3   )= sign(12 13 12 \u03c3  )13\u03c3  )= \u2212\nstrictly nonstrictly\nhyperbolic\nstrictly\nstrictly\nnonstrictly\nhyperbolic\nFig. 3.1.

Change of type in the model (2.9)\u2013(2.13).\nSince our problem is time dependent, the appearance of an elliptic region results\nin ill-posedness of the initial value problem (2.1), (2.2). Let us examine the linear\nstability of a particular class of solutions, namely the constant solutions. Linearizing\nabout the constant state (w\u00af1, w\u00af2) by setting (w1, w2) = (w\u00af1 + u1, w\u00af2 + u2), we find\nu1,t + v1(w\u00af2)u1,x + w\u00af1\n\u2202v1\n\u2202w2\n(w\u00af2)u2,x = 0,(3.2)\nu2,t + v2(w\u00af1)u2,x + w\u00af2\n\u2202v2\n\u2202w1\n(w\u00af1)u1,x = 0.(3.3)\nThis system has plane wave solutions of the form\n(u1, u2) = (l1, l2)e\ni(\u03c9t+kx)\nwith the dispersion law \u03c9 = \u03c9(k) given by\n\u03c9(k) = k\n(\n\u2212tr(A)\u00b1\u221atr(A)2 \u2212 4 det(A)\n2\n)\n,(3.4)\nwhere\nA =\n(\nv1(w\u00af2) w\u00af1\n\u2202v1\n\u2202w2\n(w\u00af2)\nw\u00af2\n\u2202v2\n\u2202w1\n(w\u00af1) v2(w\u00af1)\n)\n.\nWe see that \u03c9(k)\/k is an eigenvalue of A with eigenvector l = (l1, l2). When A\nhas complex eigenvalues, that is, when \u2206(w\u00af1, w\u00af2) = tr(A)\n2 \u2212 4 det(A) < 0, we find\nsolutions with unbounded exponential growth for high frequencies, so that the system\nis linearly unstable with unbounded growth rate in the elliptic region.\nThe most interesting interactions occur away from the strictly hyperbolic regime.\nThis fact has also been observed in other models, for instance, in [16] the change in\ntype from hyperbolic to elliptic marks the onset of shear band formation.\nIn this paper we will restrict ourselves to the analysis of model (2.5)\u2013(2.6) and\nmoreover, we will assume that one of the dislocation densities is large enough to pin\nthe other. Under this assumption, the system, that reduces to an scalar equation,\nremains in the hyperbolic (either strictly or nonstrictly) region. We show in section\n3.2 an example of a solution of (2.5)\u2013(2.6) entering the nonstrictly hyperbolic region,\nwhich describes the pile-up of a family of dislocations.\n2176 A. CARPIO, S. J. CHAPMAN, AND J. J. L. VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ\nAs usual in hyperbolic systems nonuniqueness problems arise due to the presence\nof discontinuities. For this reason we have also analyzed the regularized model (2.14).\nAssuming that (2.14) has indeed a physical sense, the only reasonable solutions for\n(2.5)\u2013(2.6) are those which can be obtained as limits of (2.14) as \u0018 tends to zero.\nFrom the mathematical point of view, this is analogous to the regularization of scalar\nhyperbolic equations by using viscosity terms. However, there are some technical\ndifferences. Due to the degeneracy of (2.14), the regularized problem in our case is a\nfree-boundary problem with viscosity acting only on one side of the free boundary.\n3.2. Elementary pile-up solutions. We next construct an elementary exam-\nple of a solution where pile-up occurs. As described in section 2, we will restrict our\nattention to situations where the second family is held fixed through some exterior\nmechanism, and examine its influence on the motion of the first family. We will as-\nsume that the density of the second family is large enough to pin the first family in\nsome regions of space, but not in others, where the evolution of the density can be\nreadily computed by the method of characteristics. We assume first that the stress\nfield is such as to move these dislocations toward the region of the space where they\nare pinned, resulting in a pile-up phenomenon.\nWe start from an initial smooth density w1,0(x) and take w2(x) to be smooth and\nmonotonically increasing from \u03b1 to \u03b2 with 0 < \u03b1 < k = \u03c3212\/a\n2 = w2(0) < \u03b2. Then\nw1,t + (((\u03c312 \u2212 a\n\u221a\nw2(x))\n+)\u03b3w1)x = 0.(3.5)\nLet c(x) = ((\u03c312 \u2212 a\n\u221a\nw2,0(x))\n+)\u03b3 . By our choice of w2, we see that, for x > 0 the\ncoefficient c(x) vanishes and w1(x, t) = w1,0(x).\nWhen x < 0, the evolution of w1 is given by (3.5). Set v(x, t) = w1(x, t)c(x).\nThen\nvt + c(x)vx = 0.(3.6)\nThus, v(x, t) is constant along the characteristic curves x(t), which are the solutions\nof\ndx(t)\ndt\n= c(x(t)) = ((\u03c312 \u2212 a\n\u221a\nw2(x(t)))\n+)\u03b3 \u2265 0.(3.7)\nThis yields the formula\nw1(x(t), t) = w1,0(x(0))\nc(x(0))\nc(x(t))\n\u2265 w1,0(x(0)) > k2(3.8)\nwhen c(x(t)) \u0007= 0, so that w1 is increasing. Generically, we can assume \u2202w2(0)\u2202x > 0, so\nthat \u03c312 \u2212 a\n\u221a\nw2(x) \u223c \u2212\u03bbx with \u03bb > 0 as x\u2192 0\u2212.\nThen, it follows from (3.7) that, for x small and negative, the equation for the\ncharacteristics may be approximated by\ndx\ndt\n(t) \u2248 (\u2212\u03bbx(t))\u03b3 .(3.9)\nWe must distinguish three cases.\nCase 1. \u03b3 > 1. Integrating (3.9), we obtain for small x(0) < 0\nx(t) \u223c \u2212 1\n(\u03bb\u03b3(\u03b3 \u2212 1)t+ (\u2212x(0))1\u2212\u03b3) 1\u03b3\u22121\n< 0.(3.10)\nPILE-UP SOLUTIONS FOR CONSERVATION LAWS 2177\nNotice that, in this case, the characteristics starting at negative values remain negative\nfor all times. Also, x(t)\u2192 0 as t\u2192\u221e.\nThen,\nx(0) \u223c x\n(1\u2212 \u03bb\u03b3(\u03b3 \u2212 1)t(\u2212x)\u03b3\u22121) 1\u03b3\u22121\n.(3.11)\nUsing (3.8) and (3.11) we deduce\nw1(x, t) = w1,0(x(0))\nc(x(0))\nc(x)\n\u2192 w1,0(0) = w1(0+, t)(3.12)\nas x\u2192 0\u2212. Notice that the function w1(x, t) is continuous at x = 0.\nCase 2. \u03b3 = 1. Integrating (3.9), it follows that for small x(0) < 0 the character-\nistics are given by\nx(t) = x(0)e\u2212\u03bbt(3.13)\nwhich again remain negative at all times. Notice that x(t) tends to 0 as t\u2192\u221e. Using\n(3.8) and (3.13) we conclude\nw1(x, t) \u2248 w1,0(xe\u03bbt)e\u03bbt.(3.14)\nLetting x\u2192 0\u2212 for each t fixed, we get\nw1(0\n\u2212, t) = e\u03bbtw1,0(0) = e\u03bbtw1(0+, t)(3.15)\nso that w1(x, t) jumps at x = 0 for every t > 0. We construct a global solution for\nx \u2208 R to (3.5) by the method of characteristics defining w1(x, t) = w1,0(x) for x > 0\nand as the solution of (3.5) given by (3.8) for x < 0. By standard arguments, w1\ndefined in this way is a weak solution if the following Rankine\u2013Hugoniot condition is\nsatisfied:\n0 =\nc(0\u2212)w1(0\u2212, t)\u2212 c(0+)w1(0+, t)\nw1(0\u2212, t)\u2212 w1(0+, t) .(3.16)\nThis identity is a consequence of (3.5) and the definition of w1 for x > 0.\nCase 3. 0 < \u03b3 < 1. In this case, the solution of (3.9) is given by\nx(t) = \u2212((\u2212x(0))1\u2212\u03b3 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b3(1\u2212 \u03b3)t) 11\u2212\u03b3(3.17)\nfor x(0) < 0 small. Notice that, for Tc =\n(\u2212x(0))1\u2212\u03b3\n\u03bb\u03b3(1\u2212\u03b3) , we obtain x(Tc) = 0.\nUsing (3.8), (3.17), and letting x\u2192 0\u2212, we get\nw1(x, t) \u223c w1,0(\u2212(\u03bb\u03b3(1\u2212 \u03b3)t) 11\u2212\u03b3 )c(\u2212(\u03bb\n\u03b3(1\u2212 \u03b3)t) 11\u2212\u03b3 )\n\u03bb\u03b3 |x|\u03b3 .(3.18)\nWe see that w1(x, t) blows up as x\u2192 0\u2212 for every t > 0.\nNotice that along a characteristic x(t) starting at x(0) < 0, w2(x(t)) tends to\n\u03c3212\na2 .\nThus, the density w1(x(t), t) tends to infinity as t \u2192 \u221e while it moves with a speed\nc(x(t)) decreasing to zero. This shows that w1 piles-up at x = 0 for large times. We\nillustrate schematicaly this phenomenon in Figures 3.3 and 3.4.\n2178 A. CARPIO, S. J. CHAPMAN, AND J. J. L.

We illustrate the changes for x < 0, depending\non \u03b3.\nSummarizing, the analysis above shows in all three cases the function w1(x, t)\npiles up near x = 0. However, the detailed way in which this happens depends on \u03b3.\nFor \u03b3 > 1, w1(x, t) remains continuous. For \u03b3 = 1, it develops a jump discontinuity\nat x = 0. The amplitude of the jump increases exponentially with time. We will see\nlater that this jump is smoothed out if we solve (2.14) instead of (2.1), (2.5), keeping\nthe same initial data. Otherwise, if 0 < \u03b3 < 1, w1(x, t) blows up at x = 0 for every\nt > 0.\nRemark.

For \u03b3 > 1 they are classical and unique by standard results\n(cf. [15]).\n3.3. Formation of regions of low density of dislocations. Here we consider\nthe case in which the stress field is such as to move the dislocations away from the\npinned region. In between the pinned region and the retreating dislocations a region\nof low dislocation density should be created. We assume a smooth initial density\nw1,0(x) and take w2(x) to be continuous, monotonically decreasing from \u03b1 to \u03b2 with\n\u03b1 > k = w2(0) > \u03b2 and k = \u03c3\n2\n12\/a\n2 as before. To determine w1 for x > 0, we\nstudy the solution of (3.5). It is given by formula (3.8) with x(t) satisfying (3.7) such\nthat x(t) = x. Now, for x(0) > 0, x(s) increases and c(x(t)) > 0.

A local analysis shows that for \u03b3 > 1 the solution is continuous. If\n\u03b3 = 1 a jump appears.\nWhen 0 < \u03b3 < 1, w1 takes the value zero in the region (x, t), 0 < x < x0(t), where\nx0(t) is the characteristic starting from x0(0) = 0. We have instantaneous extinction\nof the solutions.\n4. Regularized solutions. In this section we study the well-posedness of the\nregularized model (2.14) in a rigorous way. As a consequence of this analysis we will\nalso obtain that the solution behaves in a self-similar manner for small times.\n4.1. Formulation of the problem. Motivated by experiments and numerical\nsimulations (see [3], [10]) which indicate that \u03b3 is close to one we restrict ourselves to\nthe particular case \u03b3 = 1, which is simpler mathematically.\nOur goal is to analyze how the regularizing terms smooth out the discontinuities\nthat appear in solutions to (3.5) when \u03b3 = 1 and \u0018 approaches to zero. We choose\nthe same initial data for w1 and a similar fixed w2(x).\nWe can construct solutions of (2.14) by solving an auxiliary-free-boundary prob-\nlem.

Structure of w1.\nwith initial data\nw1(x, 0) = w1,0(x).(4.2)\nWe will construct particular solutions of (4.1), (4.2) where c(x)\u2212 \u0018w1,x changes sign\nonce at x = \u03bb(t) (see Figure 4.1). More precisely, in the region x < \u03bb(t),\nw1,t + (c(x)w1)x = \u0018(w1,xw1)x,(4.3)\nwhile, for x > \u03bb(t),\nw1,t(x, t) = 0.(4.4)\nOn the curve x = \u03bb(t) we have\nc(\u03bb(t)) = \u0018w1,x(\u03bb(t), t).(4.5)\nMoreover, it is reasonable on physical grounds to assume that w1 is continuous across\n\u03bb(t), namely,\nw1(\u03bb(t)\n\u2212, t) = w1(\u03bb(t)+, t).(4.6)\nIt is easily checked that every solution of the free-boundary problem (4.2)\u2013(4.6) solves\n(4.1), (4.2) in the sense of distributions only if the additional condition\n(x\u2212 \u03bb(t))(c(x)\u2212 \u0018w1,x) < 0, x \u0007= \u03bb(t)(4.7)\nis satisfied.

Well-posedness and uniqueness. Some comments on the well-posedness\nof the initial value problem for (4.1) are in order. We will consider later the existence\nof solutions. The uniqueness of (4.1), (4.2) is a nonclassical problem due to the\nnonuniform parabolicity of the equation. We will not address this problem in this\npaper in detail. However, it is interesting to observe that we can trivially construct an\ninfinite family of solutions to the free-boundary problem (4.2)\u2013(4.6) (but in principle\nPILE-UP SOLUTIONS FOR CONSERVATION LAWS 2181\nnot of the parabolic equations (4.1), (4.2)) taking any arbitrary smooth decreasing\nfunction \u03bb(t). To do so, we solve the boundary value problem (4.2), (4.3), (4.5) for\nany \u03bb(t) decreasing fixed. This yields a value for w1(\u03bb\n\u2212(t), t) so that we can define\nw1(x, t) = w1(\u03bb\n\u2212(t), t) by means of (4.6) for \u03bb(t) \u2264 x \u2264 \u03bb(0). When x > \u03bb(0),\nw1(x, t) = w1,0(x).\nNevertheless, the solutions constructed in this way are not solutions of (4.1), (4.2)\nsince they should also satisfy the extra condition (4.7). It turns out that these extra\nconditions do not hold. Indeed, differentiating the boundary condition (4.6) with\nrespect to t and using (4.4) we get w\u2212x \u03bb\n\u2032 + wt = w+x \u03bb\n\u2032. Using (4.3) we may rewrite\nthis as\n0 < (wx(\u03bb(t)\n+, t)\u2212 c(\u03bb(t)))\u2212 (wx(\u03bb(t)\u2212, t)\u2212 c(\u03bb(t))) = (\u2212c+wx)wx+(\u2212c\u2032+wxx)w.\nTaking into account that for x = \u03bb(t), c(x) + wx vanishes, using (4.7) as well as\n\u03bb\u2032(t) < 0, we conclude that wxx < c\u2032(x). Let u = wx \u2212 c. Then\nu = 0, ux < 0 at x = \u03bb(t),(4.8)\nu < 0, x < \u03bb(t).(4.9)\nNow, u solves the parabolic equation ut = (wxu+ wux)x. Taking into account (4.8),\n(4.9) we obtain a contradiction.\nSummarizing, the solutions of the free-boundary problem (4.2)\u2013(4.6) with \u03bb\u2032(t) <\n0 are not solutions of (4.1), (4.2). We will see later that it is possible to construct\nsolutions of the free-boundary problem with \u03bb\u2032(t) > 0 satisfying (4.7) and therefore\nsolving (4.1), (4.2).\n4.3. Reformulation of the free-boundary problem. We now rewrite the\nproblem in a more convenient way for the analysis of well-posedness. Let us define\nz(x, t) = \u2202w1\u2202x . Differentiating (4.3) with respect to x we obtain for x < \u03bb(t), t > 0\n\u2202z\n\u2202t\n+\n(\nc\u2032\u2032(x)\u2212 \u0018 \u2202\n2z\n\u2202x2\n)\nw1 + 2\n(\nc\u2032(x)\u2212 \u0018 \u2202z\n\u2202x\n)\nz +\n(\nc(x)\u2212 \u0018z)\u2202z\n\u2202x\n= 0.(4.10)\nIf we assume \u03bb\u2032 > 0, then w1(x, t) = w1,0(x) for x > \u03bb(t) and (cf. (4.4))\nw1(\u03bb(t), t) = w1,0(\u03bb(t)).(4.11)\nDifferentiating this identity we obtain(\n\u2202w1,0\n\u2202x\n(\u03bb(t))\u2212 1\n\u0018\nc(\u03bb(t))\n)\n\u03bb\u2032(t) =\n(\nc\u2032(\u03bb(t))\u2212 \u0018 \u2202z\n\u2202x\n(\u03bb(t), t)\n)\nw1,0(\u03bb(t)).(4.12)\nThe free-boundary condition (4.5) reads\nc(\u03bb(t)) = \u0018z(\u03bb(t), t).(4.13)\nProblem (4.10), (4.12), (4.13) now has a resemblance with the classical Stefan\nproblem, which has been widely studied and for which a large wealth of mathematical\ntechniques are available. In order to further simplify the problem, we introduce a new\nvariable u(x, t) = \u0018z(x, t)\u2212 c(x).\nIn this new variable, problem (4.10), (4.12), (4.13) becomes\nut \u2212 \u0018w1uxx \u2212 2(u+ c)ux \u2212 u(ux + c\u2032) = 0, x < \u03bb(t),(4.14)\nu(\u03bb(t), t) = 0,(4.15)\nu(\u03bb(t), 0)\u03bb\u2032(t) = \u0018w1,0(\u03bb(t))\n\u2202u(\u03bb(t), t)\n\u2202x\n.(4.16)\n2182 A. CARPIO, S. J. CHAPMAN, AND J. J. L. VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ\nProblem (4.14)\u2013(4.16) has several analogies to the Stefan problem. However, a\ntechnical difficulty arises at time zero. The starting point for the free boundary \u03bb(t)\nis characterized by means of\nc(\u03bb(0)) = \u0018\n\u2202w1,0(\u03bb(0))\n\u2202x\n(4.17)\nor, in an equivalent way, u(\u03bb(0), 0) = 0. In particular, this implies that condition\n(4.16) becomes singular at time t = 0. In order to understand better where the\ndifficulty lies, we approximate (4.14)\u2013(4.16) by the leading order terms near x = \u03bb(0).\nBy convenience, we make the following assumption that holds for quite general initial\ndata:\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n(\u03bb(0), 0) = \u0393 \u0007= 0.(4.18)\nThis implies u(x, 0) \u223c \u0393(x\u2212 \u03bb(0)) as x\u2192 \u03bb(0).\nKeeping the leading order terms of (4.14)\u2013(4.16) in a neighborhood of x = \u03bb(0)\nwe end up with the following problem:\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= \u0018w1(\u03bb(0))\n\u22022u\n\u22022x\n, x < \u03bb(t),(4.19)\nu(\u03bb(t), t) = 0,(4.20)\n\u0393(\u03bb(t)\u2212 \u03bb(0))\u03bb\u2032 = \u0018w1(\u03bb(0))\u2202u\n\u2202x\n(\u03bb(t), t)(4.21)\ncomplemented with the initial condition u(x, 0) = \u0393(x\u2212 \u03bb(0)).\nProblem (4.19)\u2013(4.21) admits a self-similar solution with increasing \u03bb(t) in the\nform\nu\u02c6(x, t) =\n\u221a\n\u0018w1(0)t\u03c6\n(\nx\u2212 \u03bb(0)\u221a\n\u0018w1(0)t\n)\n,(4.22)\n\u03bb\u02c6(t) = \u03bb(0) + \u03be0\n\u221a\n\u0018w1(0)t\n|\u0393| ,(4.23)\ny =\nx\u2212 \u03bb(0)\u221a\n\u0018w1(0)t\n.(4.24)\nThe detailed construction of this solution is given in Appendix A. In the next\nsection we discuss how to construct solutions of (4.14)\u2013(4.16) as perturbations of this\nself-similar solution as t\u2192 0.\n4.4. Perturbations of the self-similar solution. We want to obtain solutions\nof the original problem as perturbations of the self-similar solution to the leading order\napproximation as t\u2192 0. Throughout this section we keep \u0018 fixed. Then, we will ignore\nthe dependence on \u0018 of all the constants appearing here. We will consider the behavior\nas \u0018\u2192 0 in the next section.\nPILE-UP SOLUTIONS FOR CONSERVATION LAWS 2183\nWe assume that the initial data are smooth enough. More precisely, we assume\nthat\nu(x, 0) = \u0393(x\u2212 \u03bb(0)) +O((x\u2212 \u03bb(0))2) < 0, x\u2192 \u03bb(0).(4.25)\nWe also assume w1,0(x) to be globally bounded:\n0 <\n1\nK\n< w1,0(x) < K.(4.26)\nThe main result of this section is the following.\nTheorem 4.1. For any initial datum w1,0(x) satisfying (4.25), (4.26), smooth\nenough, and for any bounded c \u2208 C2, there exists a global solution of the free-boundary\nproblem (4.2)\u2013(4.6) where \u03bb(t) \u2208 C1+\u03b1(0,\u221e), 0 < \u03b1 < 12 . Moreover, \u03bb(t) = \u03be0\n\u221a\nt(1+\no(1)) as t\u2192 0+.\nRemark. Near t = 0 the asymptotic behavior of w1(x, t) can be obtained by means\nof the self-similar solution (4.22), (4.23) discussed in Appendix A.\nSketch of the proof. The main difficulty in the proof of Theorem 4.1 is the fact\nthat the free boundary for the self-similar solution (4.22), (4.23) behaves as a square\nroot as t \u2192 0+. Actually, the same will happen for the solutions of the whole free-\nboundary problem (4.2)\u2013(4.6). Without this difficulty the solution could be a more\nor less standard adaptation of the fixed point argument used for the analysis of the\nclassical one-dimensional Stefan problem (cf. [9]).\nIn order to sort out this difficulty we will approximate (4.2)\u2013(4.6) by means of\n\u2202w1,n\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n((\nc(x)\u2212 \u0018\u2202w1,n\n\u2202x\n)\nw1,n\n)\n= 0, x < \u03bbn(t), t > tn,(4.27)\nc(\u03bbn(t)) = \u0018\n\u2202w1,n\n\u2202x\n(\u03bb(t), t),(4.28)\nw1,n(\u03bbn(t), t) = w1,0(\u03bbn(t)),(4.29)\nw1,n(x, tn) = \u21260(x, tn), x < \u03bbn(tn),(4.30)\nwith tn =\n1\nn , \u03bbn(tn) = \u03bb\u02c6(tn) = \u03be0\n\u221a\n1\nn + \u03bb(0). Notice that the free boundaries\n\u03bbn(t) start at time tn at the free boundary of the self-similar solution. Also, we\ntake as initial data for w1,n at time tn an approximation \u21260(x, tn) that we obtain by\nintegrating u(x, t) = \u0018\n\u2202w1,0\n\u2202x (x, t) \u2212 c(x) with the self-similar solution given in (A.1),\n(4.23) evaluated at tn as initial data.\nNow, since \u03bbn(tn) \u0007= 0, problem (4.27)\u2013(4.30) can be solved by means of a slight\nadaptation of the classical techniques for the Stefan problem (cf. [8], [9]). However,\nthe time of existence for the solutions, as well as the estimates derived for such a\nproblem could be strongly dependent on n. In the technical analysis that will be\nmade in Appendix B, we will show that this is not the case. More precisely, we will\nprove there that there exists a \u03b4 > 0 independent on n such that (B.10)\u2013(B.12) hold,\nwhere C is independent of n.\nTaking the limit n\u2192\u221e, we will obtain a solution of (4.2)\u2013(4.6) in a time interval\n[0, \u03b4). As a final step, we will obtain a global existence result by means of suitable\nsub- and supersolutions, as usual in the classical one-dimensional Stefan problem.\n2184 A. CARPIO, S. J. CHAPMAN, AND J. J. L. VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ\n5. Asymptotics of the solutions as \u0001 \u2192 0. In this section, we describe\nformally the asymptotics of the free-boundary problem (4.2)\u2013(4.6) as \u0018 \u2192 0.

Actually, if k > 0 the argument given in Appendix\nB shows that the solution is global.\nWe now pass to describe the asymptotics of problem (4.2)\u2013(4.6) as \u0018\u2192 0. In the\nouter region, where w1,x does not develop large gradients, (4.3) can be approximated\nby the hyperbolic equation\nw1,t + (cw1)x = 0, x < \u03bb(t).(5.27)\nThis approximation is valid for x at distances O(1) of the free boundary \u03bb(t). Equation\n(5.27) has been analyzed in section 3, where we have seen that the solution develops\na discontinuity at x = 0 that grows exponentially. Since the solutions of the original\nfree-boundary problem (4.2)\u2013(4.6) do not develop discontinuities, a boundary layer is\nrequired near the free boundary x = \u03bb(t). For not very long times, we can understand\nthe structure of such a boundary layer introducing the variables (5.12)\u2013(5.14). In the\ndiffusive boundary layer the behavior is controlled by the equations\nw1,t \u2212 ((k\u03be + w1,\u03be)w1)\u03be = 0, \u03be < X(t),(5.28)\nw1(X(t), t) = w1,0(0),(5.29)\nkX(t) + w1,\u03be = 0, \u03be = X(t),(5.30)\nw1(\u03be, 0) = w1,0(0).(5.31)\nThe long time asymptotics of (5.28)\u2013(5.31) can be analyzed by means of the change\nof variables\nw1 = e\nktG, \u03be = e\nkt\n2 \u03b7, X = e\nkt\n2 Y(5.32)\nwhich leads to\n\u2202G\n\u2202t\n\u2212 3\n2\nk\u03b7\n\u2202G\n\u2202\u03b7\n\u2212 \u2202\n\u2202\u03b7\n(\nG\n\u2202G\n\u2202\u03b7\n)\n= 0, \u03b7 < Y (t),(5.33)\nG(Y (t), t) = w1,0(0)e\n\u2212kt,(5.34)\nkY (t) +\n\u2202G\n\u2202\u03b7\n(Y (t), t) = 0.(5.35)\nThe jump discontinuity for w1(x, t) in the outer region imposes on G the following\nmatching condition:\nG \u223c w1,0(0) as \u03b7 \u2192 \u2212\u221e.(5.36)\nFor times t = O(1) the asymptotics of w1(x, t) near the free boundary is described\nby the solution G of (5.33)\u2013(5.36). Existence of global solutions can be discussed as\nin section 4.4.\n2186 A. CARPIO, S. J. CHAPMAN, AND J. J. L. VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ\nOn the other hand, the long-time asymptotics of (5.33)\u2013(5.36) can be described\nas follows. There exist several steady states of (5.33)\u2013(5.35) satisfying the matching\ncondition (5.36). The one which is relevant for our purposes is characterized by the\nfact that it is supported in (\u2212\u221e, \u03b70) and satisfies\nG \u223c 3\n4\nk\u03b70(\u03b70 \u2212 \u03b7).(5.37)\nThe detailed description of the steady states of (5.33) is given in Appendix C.\nSome steady states are positive in the whole line and some others are supported in\na half line but behave like C(\u03b70\u2212 \u03b7) 12 . In order to see why the only admissible steady\nstate of (5.33)\u2013(5.36) is the (unique) one with linear behavior near the extinction point\n\u03b70 we describe the boundary layer that appears near the point \u03b7 = \u03b70 for (5.33)\u2013(5.36).\nMaking the standard change of variables\nG = e\u2212ktW, \u03b7 = \u03b70 + e\u2212kt\u03bd,(5.38)\nproblem (5.33)\u2013(5.36) becomes, to leading order,\n3\n2\nk\u03b70\n\u2202W\n\u2202\u03bd\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03bd\n(\nW\n\u2202W\n\u2202\u03bd\n)\n= 0, \u03bd < 0,(5.39)\nW = w1,0(0) at \u03bd = 0,(5.40)\n\u2202W\n\u2202\u03bd\n+ k\u03b70 = 0 at \u03bd = 0.(5.41)\nIntegrating (5.39) and using (5.40), (5.41) we reduce the problem to the study of the\nfirst order equation\n3\n2\nk\u03b7W +W\n\u2202W\n\u2202\u03bd\n=\nk\u03b70\n2\nw1,0(0).(5.42)\nIt is readily seen that this first order equation admits a monotonically decreasing\nsolution which takes the value w1,0 at \u03bd = 0 and behaves at infinity as\nW \u223c \u22123\n2\nk\u03b70\u03bd, as \u03bd \u2192 \u2212\u221e.(5.43)\nUsing (5.38) and (5.43), it follows that the inner behavior of the function G described\nby the function W (5.43) matches with the outer region if and only if the function G\nhas a linear behavior near \u03b70.\nWe should remark that a more refined argument is needed to exclude the case\n\u03b70 = 0. In this case (5.39) reduces to W = w1,0. It turns out that there is a unique\nsteady state of (5.33) satisfying the matching condition (5.36) supported in (\u2212\u221e, 0)\nand behaving linearly near 0. Matching between the outer and inner regions is not\npossible in this case, so that \u03b70 > 0.\nThe previous description of the boundary layer holds for times t << \u2212 1k ln(\n\u221a\n\u0018).\nIn order to describe the solution for larger times, we notice that the characteristics\nat distances |x| \u223c 1 arrive to the region |\u03b7| \u223c 1 for t \u223c 1k | log(\n\u221a\n\u0018)|. For this range of\ntimes, the data of (5.33) for |\u03b7| large, \u03b7 < 0, and \u03b7 \u223c 1 could be strongly oscillatory and\ndepends basically on the initial data. Thus, the dynamics for these times is strongly\ndependent on the initial distribution w1,0(x, 0). For larger times, the asymptotics\nof the solutions depends on the asymptotics of w1,0 as x \u2192 \u2212\u221e. For instance, if\nPILE-UP SOLUTIONS FOR CONSERVATION LAWS 2187\nFig. 5.1. Smoothing shocks out.\nw1,0(x) \u2192 w1,\u221e as x \u2192 \u2212\u221e, we obtain that w1(x, t) grows exponentially. This is,\nhowever, rather unphysical, since it is due to a large flux of dislocations coming from\nx = \u2212\u221e.\nWe conclude with some final remarks. As Figure 5.1 shows, w1(x, t) corrects the\nsolution of the conservation law we had for \u0018 = 0, which is accurate out of an inner\nboundary layer of thickness\n\u221a\n\u0018 around x = 0. In this inner boundary layer, the jump\nat x = 0 observed in the solution for \u0018 = 0 is smoothed out when \u0018 > 0.\nWe may compare this problem with the regularization of shocks in usual scalar\nconservation laws by small diffusive terms (cf. [18]). The main difference is that, in\nour case, the diffusion acts only on one side of the shock and not throughout the\nshock (see Figure 5.1) Also, notice that the correction u\u0014 matches the left value of the\njump with the value on the free boundary whereas for a shock in Burgers equation,\nfor instance, it should join the left and right values of the jump. On the other hand,\nthe length of the boundary layer is of order \u0018 for Burgers equation while in our case\nit turns out to be of order\n\u221a\n\u0018.\n6. Conclusions. We have introduced some simple one dimensional models of\ndislocation dynamics that, despite their simplicity, exhibit some features that are\nexperimentally observed in the evolution of families of dislocations. The phenomena\nwe have been interested in describing are those of pattern formation (associated with\nthe loss of hyperbolicity in our models), and the related pile-up of dislocations due to\ninhomogeneous pinning distributions.\nWe have considered two types of models. In the first of them, involving mutual\ninteractions between two families of dislocations, the equations are conservation laws\nof mixed type. The second model, in which one family of dislocations is externally\npinned, is a degenerate nonlinear parabolic system of equations that, in particular\ncases, reduces to a free-boundary problem.\nWe have discussed the well-posedness of those models. The solutions of the\nmixed system of conservation laws develop singularities for some initial data that are\nsmoothed out in the regularized parabolic problem. We have described in a detailed\nway how this regularization takes place.\nWe observe that we have obtained two different forms of pattern formation. In\nthe mode that we can call hyperbolic, we have obtained piling up of dislocations\nat the particular points where pinning forces are strong enough to stop the motion\nof dislocations. On the other hand, when both families of dislocations are free to\nmove we find small perturbations of uniform states are unstable, which should lead to\nbanding. To see whether our simple models can reproduce the honeycomb structures\n2188 A. CARPIO, S. J. CHAPMAN, AND J. J. L.

Self-similar solution. As stated in section 4, problem (4.19)\u2013\n(4.21) admits a self-similar solution with increasing \u03bb(t) in the form (4.22)\u2013(4.24). It\nfollows from (4.19), (4.20), (4.21) that the function \u03c6 in (4.22) satisfies\n\u03c6yy +\ny\u03c6\n2\n\u2212 1\n2\n\u03c6 = 0, y < \u03be0,(A.1)\n\u03c6(\u03be0) = 0,(A.2)\n\u03c6y(\u03be0) =\n\u03be20sign(\u0393)\n2\n,(A.3)\n\u03c6(y)\u2192 \u0393y, y \u2192 \u2212\u221e.(A.4)\nThe solution of (A.1), (A.2) is given by\n\u03c6(y) = \u0393y +Ky\n\u222b y\n\u2212\u221e\ne\u2212\ns2\n4\ns2\nds.(A.5)\nIt is not hard to check that the function \u03c6(y) is analytic in the whole complex plane,\nsince the singularity of the integral is cancelled out by the factor y. From now on, we\nwill understand that the integral in (A.5) is a meromorphic function in the complex\nplane with a pole at y = 0.\nThe values ofK and \u03be0 must be chosen in order to satisfy the boundary conditions\n(A.2), (A.3):\n\u0393 +K\n\u222b \u03be0\n\u2212\u221e\ne\u2212\ns2\n4\ns2\nds = 0, K\ne\u2212\n\u03be20\n4\n\u03be0\n=\n\u03be20sign(\u0393)\n2\n.(A.6)\nSince we are interested in solutions with \u03bb\u2032(t) > 0, it follows that \u03be0 > 0. Eliminating\nK from (A.6) we get for \u03be0 the equation\n|\u0393|+ (\u03be0)\n3e\n\u03be20\n4\n2\n\u222b \u03be0\n\u2212\u221e\ne\n\u2212s2\n4\ns2\nds = 0.(A.7)\nTo get rid of the singularity of the integral terms, it is convenient to rewrite (A.7) as\nfollows:\n|\u0393| = (\u03be0)\n3e\n\u03be20\n4\n2\n(\n1\n\u03be0\n+\n\u222b \u03be0\n\u2212\u221e\n1\u2212 e\u2212 s24\ns2\nds\n)\n= B(\u03be0).(A.8)\nThe function B(\u03be0) is monotonically increasing and satisfies\nB(\u03be0) \u223c \u03be\n2\n0\n2\n, \u03be0 \u2192 0+,(A.9)\nB(\u03be0) \u223c \u03b1\u03be\n3\n0e\n\u03be20\n4\n2\n, \u03be0 \u2192\u221e,(A.10)\nwhere \u03b1 =\n\u222b\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n1\u2212e\u2212 s\n2\n4\ns2 ds > 0. Therefore, there exists a unique solution \u03be0 to (A.8)\nin the interval (0,\u221e). Then, the value of K is computed using (A.6).\nPILE-UP SOLUTIONS FOR CONSERVATION LAWS 2189\nThis self-similar solution provides the local asymptotics of the solutions of the\noriginal free-boundary problem (4.2)\u2013(4.6) as t\u2192 0+.\nAppendix B. Proof of Theorem 4.1. As we stated in section 4.4 the main\nidea in the proof is to approximate problem (4.2)\u2013(4.6) by the sequence of regularized\nproblems (4.27)\u2013(4.30) with \u21260(x, t) given by\n\u21260(x, t) = w1,0(u\u02dc(t)) +\n1\n\u0018\n\u222b x\nu\u02dc(t)\nd\u03b7\n(\nc(\u03b7) + \u0393\n\u221a\n\u0018w1,0(\u03bb(0))t\n\u00b7 \u03c6\n(\n\u03b7 \u2212 \u03bb(0)\u221a\n\u0018w1,0(\u03bb(0))t\n)\n+ \u0393\n\u221a\n\u0018w1,0(\u03bb(0))t\u03bd\n(\n\u03b7 \u2212 \u03bb(0)\u221a\n\u0018w1,0(\u03bb(0))t\n))\n.(B.1)\nHere, \u03c6 is the profile of the self-similar solution (cf. (4.22), (4.23)) and \u03bd(x) = u(x, 0)\u2212\n\u0393(x\u2212 \u03bb(0)), for x < \u03bb(0). For x > \u03bb(0), \u03bd = 0. Using (B.1), we deduce\n|\u21260(x, tn)\u2212 w1,0(x)| \u2264 Ctn.(B.2)\nWe aim to solve the approximated problems (4.27), (4.28), (4.29), (4.30) for a\ntime interval independent of n and obtain uniform bounds on the solutions in such a\ntime interval. More precisely, we have the following local existence result.\nProposition B.1. If c \u2208 C2 is globally bounded and w1,0 \u2208 C2,\u03b1 with 0 < 1K <\nw1,0 < K there exists a unique solution w1,n of problem (4.27), (4.28), (4.29), (4.30)\nin a time interval [tn, tn + \u03b4(\u0018)], where \u03b4(\u0018) is independent on n.\nWe will prove Proposition B.1 in two steps. First, we will obtain a solution of\n(4.27)\u2013(4.30) in a time interval [tn, tn + \u03b4n] depending on n. This is done by means\nof a slight modification of a classical Stefan problem (cf. [9]). As a next step, we\nwill prove by means of suitable sub- and supersolutions that the time of existence is\nindependent of n.\nLemma B.2. Under the asumptions of Proposition B.1, there exists a unique\nsolution w1,n,\u03bbn to (4.27)\u2013(4.30) for a time interval [tn, tn + \u03b4n]. The free boundary\nis C1,\u03b1([tn, tn + \u03b4n]).\nProof. We introduce the following space of functions Xn =\n{\n\u03bb \u2208 C1,\u03b1[tn, tn +\n\u03b4n], \u03bb(tn) = \u03bb\u02c6(tn), \u2016\u03bb\u2016\u03b1 < M, 12 \u03bb\u02c6(t) < \u03bb(t) < 2\u03bb\u02c6(t)\n}\n. We intend to make a fixed point\nin this space of functions. To this end, we solve the boundary value problem (4.27),\n(4.29), (4.30) for any \u03bb(.) \u2208 Xn. In order to obtain some a priori estimates for w1,n\nwe use suitable sub and supersolutions. Let us define w\u02dc1(x) as the solution of\n\u0018\n\u2202w\u02dc1\n\u2202x\n= c(x), w\u02dc1(\u03bb(0)) =M,(B.3)\nwhere M > 0 will be chosen later.\nIt is straightforward to check that M2 \u2264 w\u02dc1 \u2264 32M in a neighborhood (\u03bb(0) \u2212\n\u03b70(\u0018), \u03bb(0)+ \u03b70(\u0018)), where \u03b70(\u0018) > 0 is independent of n. We truncate w\u02dc1 in a smooth\nway in order to make it constant and positive for x < \u03bb(0)\u2212 \u03b70(\u0018). Let us denote by\nw1 the resulting truncated function. Moreover, we can make this truncation in such\na way that \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2202\u2202x\n((\nc(x)\u2212 \u0018\u2202w1\n\u2202x\n)\nw1\n)\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 C(M, \u0018)w1(B.4)\nis satisfied.\n2190 A. CARPIO, S. J. CHAPMAN, AND J. J. L. VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ\nWe define w\u02c61(x, t) = w1(x)e\nLt. Picking up L and M in a suitable way we obtain\nthat w\u02c61 is a sub- or a supersolution for (4.27), (4.29), (4.30).\nSet un(x, t) = \u0018\n\u2202w1,n\n\u2202x \u2212 c(x). It is readily checked that un solves\nun,t \u2212 \u0018w1,n \u2202\n2un\n\u2202x2\n\u2212 2(un + c)\u2202un\n\u2202x\n\u2212 un\n(\n\u2202un\n\u2202x\n+ c\u2032\n)\n= 0, x < \u03bbn(t)(B.5)\nu = 0, x = \u03bbn(t).(B.6)\nFormally differentiating (4.28), we obtain\nu(x, 0)\u03bb\u2032(t) = \u0018w1,0(x)\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n(x, t), x = \u03bb(t).(B.7)\nObviously, given an arbitrary function \u03bbn(t) \u2208 Xn, condition (B.7) is not satisfied.\nHowever, we intend to choose \u03bbn(t) verifying (B.7) by means of a fixed point argument.\nTaking into account u(x, 0) \u2248 \u0393(x \u2212 \u03bb(0)) + O((x \u2212 \u03bb(0))2) we can check that\nun(\u03bb(t), 0) \u0007= 0 for any \u03bb \u2208 Xn. We then rewrite (B.7) in an integral form\n\u03bb(t) = \u03bb(tn) +\n\u222b t\ntn\n\u0018w1,0(\u03bb(t))\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n(\u03bb(s), s)ds = T (\u03bb(t)).(B.8)\nClassical regularity theory for parabolic equations shows that \u2202u\u2202x (\u03bb(t), t) \u2208 C\n1\n2+\n\u03b1\n2\nt [tn,\ntn + \u03b4n]. Actually, we have uniform bounds for this derivative depending only on\nthe initial data as well as M . From this, we inmediatedly deduce that the operator\nT (\u03bb(t)) has a fixed point for \u03b4n small enough by means of a standard contractive fixed\npoint argument. Since the argument is well known for the classical Stefan problem\nwe shall not provide more details here.\nNotice that we have obtained a solution w1,n of (4.27), (4.29), (4.30) satisfying\n(B.7). It only remains to check that condition (4.28) holds. To this end, notice that\n(B.7) implies \u2202\u2202t\n(\nw1,n(\u03bb(t)\n\u2212, t)\u2212w1,0(\u03bb(t))\n)\n= 0, whence w1,n(\u03bb(t)\n\u2212, t) = w1,0(\u03bb(t))+\nK. Evaluating this expression for t = tn and taking into account (B.1), we deduce\nthat K = 0. Thus, (4.28) follows.\nRemark. As a subproduct of the proof of Lemma B.2 we have obtained\n0 <\n1\nM \u2032\n\u2264 w1,n \u2264M \u2032, t \u2208 [tn, tn + \u03b4n].(B.9)\nActually, the argument shows that this estimate is satisfied as far as w1,n is defined\nif t \u2264 \u03b4(\u0018), where \u03b4(\u0018) is a suitable number independent of \u0018.\nLemma B.3. Under the assumptions of Proposition B.1, the following estimates\nhold in [tn, tn + \u03b4n] for x < min(\u03bbn(t), \u03bb\u02c6(t)):\n|un(x, t)\u2212 u\u02c6(x, t)| \u2264 C((x\u2212 \u03bb(0))2 + t),(B.10) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202un\u2202x (x, t)\u2212 \u2202u\u02c6\u2202x (x, t)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 C(|x\u2212 \u03bb(0)|+\u221at),(B.11)\n|\u03bbn(t)\u2212 \u03bb\u02c6(t)| \u2264 Ct,(B.12)\nwhere u\u02c6 and \u03bb\u02c6 correspond to the self-similar solution (4.22), (4.23) and un, \u03bbn are the\nsolutions constructed in Lemma B.2. The constant C does not depend on n, although\nit could depend on \u0018.\nPILE-UP SOLUTIONS FOR CONSERVATION LAWS 2191\nProof.

In particular (and depending on the sign of\n\u03bd0), we can assume that G is either strictly positive or negative.\nWe define the function \u03bd(\u03c4) by means of the Dirichlet boundary condition (B.29).\nUsing the implicit function theorem it is not hard to check that there exists a function\n\u03bd solving (B.29) and satisfying\n|\u03bd(\u03c4)\u2212 \u03bd0| \u2264 CM\n\u221a\nt, |\u03bd\u03c4 | \u2264 CM\n\u221a\nt.(B.39)\nWe now proceed to determine the function W in (B.31). In order to ensure that\nQ is a subsolution (resp., supersolution) of problem (B.28), (B.29), (B.20), W must\nbe a subsolution (resp., supersolution) for problem\nW\u03c4 \u2212 y\n2\nyWy +W \u2212 (1 + h)Wyy = h|Gyy|,(B.40)\nW (\u03be0 + \u03bd(\u03c4)\n\u221a\nt, \u03c4) = 0.(B.41)\nThe boundary condition (B.30) becomes, after using (B.33), (B.35), (B.36), and\n(B.39),\n\u03be0\u03bd\u03c4 \u2265 (\u2264)\n(\n\u2202W\n\u2202y\n+ f3(\u03c4)\n)\n,(B.42)\nwhere |f3(\u03c4)| \u2264 CM\n\u221a\nt.\n2194 A. CARPIO, S. J. CHAPMAN, AND J. J. L. VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ\nWe split W = W1 + W2, where W1 will control the right-hand side in (B.40)\nand W2 will take care of the free-boundary condition (B.41). We need to choose W1\nverifying\nW1,\u03c4 \u2212 y\n2\nyW1,y +W1 \u2212 (1 + h)W1,yy \u2265 (\u2264)|h||Gyy|,(B.43)\nW1(\u03be0 + \u03bd(\u03c4)\n\u221a\nt, \u03c4) = 0.(B.44)\nTaking into account (B.38) it is easily seen that |Gyy| \u2264 CM . Using this fact and\n(B.24) we can obtain a function W1 satisfying (B.40), (B.41) and\n|W1| \u2264 C(M)\n\u221a\nt(1 +\n\u221a\ny)(B.45)\nfor 0 \u2264 t \u2264 R0, with R0 independent on n. The construction of W1 is achieved by\nusing sub- and supersolutions of the form W\u02dc1 = e\n\u03c4\n2 S(y) where S is a positive solution\nof\nSyy +\ny\n2\nSy \u2212 3\n2\nS = C(M)(1 + |y|)(B.46)\nverifying |S| \u2264 C(M)(1 + |y|). From (B.45) and standard regularizing effects for\nparabolic equations we deduce that\n|W1,y| \u2264 C(M)\n\u221a\nt(B.47)\nat the free boundary y = \u03be0 + \u03bd(\u03c4)\n\u221a\nt.\nFinally, we define W2 as a solution of the boundary value problem\nW2,\u03c4 \u2212 y\n2\nyW2,y +W2 \u2212 hW2,yy = 0,(B.48)\nW2(\u03be0 + \u03bd(\u03c4)\n\u221a\nt, \u03c4) = 0.(B.49)\nActually, we want to select W2 in such a way that (B.42) holds. Taking into account\n(B.29), (B.47) and the bound on f3, it turns out that in order to obtain (B.42) we\njust need to have W2 such that\nW2,y(\u03be0 + \u03bd(\u03c4)\n\u221a\nt, \u03c4) \u223c \u00b1A\u221at,(B.50)\nwhere A is a constant depending on M . This can be achieved solving\n\u03c8t = (1 + h)\u03c8xx, \u03c8(x, 0) = \u00b1min(A\u02dcx3, 1)(B.51)\nin x \u2264 \u03be\u221at + \u03bd(\u03c4)t, with A\u02dc large enough. Defining W2 in such a way that \u03c8(x, t) =\nt\n3\nW2(y, \u03c4) we obtain (B.50).\nNotice that the functions Q we have constructed so far are sub- and supersolutions\njust in a neighborhood of the origin. In order to estimate the solutions away from the\norigin we can just take into account (5.43), (B.47) and standard regularizing effects\nfor parabolic equations. We then obtain that v is bounded in the line x = \u2212X0.\nHere, X0 is a small number independent on n, chosen in such a way that Q is a\nsub-supersolution for x \u2265 \u2212X0. We can then add to the function Q an additional\nterm R(x, t) that solves (B.18), vanishes for t = 0, controls the boundary values of\nv in x = \u2212X0, and vanishes along the curves x = \u03be0\n\u221a\nt + \u03bd(\u03c4)t. Standard estimates\nfor the Green function of parabolic equations with bounded coefficients (cf. [2]) imply\nthat |Ry| \u2264 Ce\u2212 \u03b2t for some \u03b2 > 0.\nPILE-UP SOLUTIONS FOR CONSERVATION LAWS 2195\nu+\nu-\nu\nu=0\nFig. B.1. Maximum principle.\nIt is not hard to check that after a slight modification (if needed) of the function\nW2, Q+R is a sub-supersolution satisfying (B.28), (B.29), (B.30).\nWe now show how the maximun principle works for these type of free-boundary\nproblems. It can be checked that for short times, the most important term in the sub-\nand supersolution Q is the function \u2212\u03bd0G\u02dc(y).\nNotice that, in the original set of variables (B.12) the aspect of super- and sub-\nsolutions compared to u is the one given in Figure B.1. It is important to take into\naccount that both the sub- and the supersolution vanish at their free boundaries due\nto (B.29).\nOn the other hand, as far as \u03bb+ \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 \u03bb\u2212 we can use the classical maximum\nprinciple to show that\nu\u2212 \u2264 u \u2264 u+(B.52)\nin any common region of validity. If at some particular time, there is an intersection\nbetween \u03bb and \u03bb+ (resp., \u03bb\u2212), it follows from (B.52) that \u2202u\u2202x \u2265 \u2202u\n+\n\u2202x (resp.,\n\u2202u\n\u2202x \u2264 \u2202u\n\u2212\n\u2202x ).\nTaking into account (B.30) it then follows that d\u03bb\n+\ndt <\nd\u03bb\ndt (resp.,\nd\u03bb\u2212\ndt >\nd\u03bb\ndt ). It then\nfollows that \u03bb remains between \u03bb+ and \u03bb\u2212 as far as the solution is defined. Therefore,\n(B.11) follows.\nOn the other hand, we have obtained\nvn(x, t) \u2265 CM t\n(\n1 +\n(\nx\u221a\nt\n)2)\n, x \u2265 \u03bb(t)\u2212 2\u03bd0t,(B.53)\nvn(x, t) \u2265 \u2212CM t\n(\n1 +\n(\nx\u221a\nt\n)2)\n, x \u2264 \u03bb(t).(B.54)\nWe can extend the region of validity of (B.53), (B.54) taking into account that, by\n(B.11), v is linearly bounded by t at the free boundary and using a linear supersolution\n(in t). This proves (B.9).\nFinally, (B.10) follows by means of a rescaling, as well as classical regularizing\neffects. Integrating (B.9), we obtain\n|w1(x, t)\u2212 w1,0(\u03bb(0))| \u2264 C(\n\u221a\nt+ |x|)|\u03bb(t)| \u2264 2|\u03bb(t)|,(B.55)\nwhere C can be chosen independently on M if t is small enough (and also on n). This\nconcludes the bootstrap argument that we began in (B.24), (B.25).\nEnd of the proof of Proposition B.1. In order to prove uniformity in n for the time\nof existence of the solutions we use (as usual for the classical Stefan problem) suitable\n2196 A. CARPIO, S. J. CHAPMAN, AND J. J. L. VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ\nsub- and supersolutions. To this end, we first transform the free-boundary problem\nin a fixed-boundary problem by means of the change of variables y = y\u02dc +\n\u221a\nt\u03bd(\u03c4).\nIt is not hard to construct sub- and supersolutions for (B.13)\u2013(B.16) in the form\nu =\n\u221a\ntH(y), where H satisfies\n\u2212 \u2202\n2\n\u2202y2\nH \u2212 y\n2\n\u2202H\n\u2202y\n+\nH\n2\n\u2265 (\u2264)\u00180 \u2202H\n\u2202y\n,(B.56)\nwhere \u00180 is a small positive number and t is small enough (independent on n). We\nthen obtain in this form that\n|\u03bb\u02d9(t)| \u2264 C\u221a\nt\n.(B.57)\nCombining (B.9), (B.11), and (B.57) we obtain by means of a rescaling and classical\nparabolic estimates (B.10).\nEnd of the proof of Theorem 4.1. A standard compactness argument shows that\nthe sequence (un, \u03bbn) converges as n \u2192 \u221e to a function (u, \u03bb) which solves (4.14)\u2013\n(4.16). Notice that the initial data, as well as the free-boundary condition, pass to\nthe limit due to (B.9), (B.10), (B.11), which hold for a time 0 \u2264 t \u2264 \u03b4(\u0018).\nIt only remains to show that the solution so far obtained is globally defined in\ntime. Taking into account the assumption (4.26) it follows (using exponential sub-\nand supersolutions) that the function w1(x, t) satisfies 0 \u2264 1C(T ) \u2264 w1(x, t) \u2264 C(T )\nfor 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T . As for the classical Stefan problem, it is enough to check that,\nif |\u03bb\u02d9(t)| \u2264 C(T ) for 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T . This is done by comparison with a subsolution.\nCombining (4.25) and (4.15), (4.16) we have that \u03bb\u02d9(t) > 0.\nIt is convenient to transform the problem in a fixed free-boundary problem by\nmeans of the change of variables x = \u03bb(t) + \u0018.\nIn this new set of variables we can construct a subsolution for (4.14)\u2013(4.16) in the\nform\nu = C1\u03be + C2\u03be\n2(B.58)\nfor \u03be < 0 close to 0 and then extending by a constant. Since u is bounded in compact\nsets, away from the free boundary, by classical regularizing effects we can use (B.58)\nas a subsolution for our problem. By comparison \u2202u\u2202x \u2264 C(T ) for 0 \u2264 t \u2264 C(T ). We\ndo not insist on the details since the argument is standard.\nAppendix C. Phase portrait. In this section, we study the solutions of the\nordinary differential equation\n\u03b7G\u03b7 +GG\u03b7\u03b7 +G\n2\n\u03b7 = 0(C.1)\nwhich are the steady states of (5.33). We recall that in section 5 we were interested in\nsolutions of (C.1) satisfying the matching condition (5.36). Therefore, we will consider\nsolutions of (C.1) satisfying\nG(\u03b7)\u2192 k, \u03b7 \u2192 \u2212\u221e,(C.2)\nwhere k is a positive constant. Moreover, by the analysis in section 5, the function G\nshould be supported in a half line.\nPILE-UP SOLUTIONS FOR CONSERVATION LAWS 2197\nStandard local analysis for ordinary differential equations shows that for each\nconstant C \u2208 R there exists a unique solution of (C.1) satisfying\nG \u223c k + C e\n\u2212 \u03b722k\n|\u03b7| , \u03b7 \u2192 \u2212\u221e.(C.3)\nIt readily follows from (C.1) that G is a strictly monotonic function unless it is a\nconstant. On the other hand, since G must vanish at a finite \u03b70 \u2208 R we should take\nC < 0 in (C.3).\nIn order to describe the solutions of (C.1) it is convenient to transform the equa-\ntion into an autonomous system by means of the change of variables\n\u03b7 = sign(\u03b7)e\u03c4 , G = \u03b72W, Z = 2W + \u03b7W\u03b7.(C.4)\nIn these variables, (C.1) becomes\nZ\u03c4 = \u2212Z \u2212 Z + Z\n2\nW\n= \u2212 (ZW + Z + Z\n2)\nW\n,(C.5)\nW\u03c4 = Z \u2212 2W.(C.6)\nWe remark that system (C.5), (C.6) is independent of the sign of \u03b7 although the\nchange of variables (C.4) depends on it.\nSince G\u03b7 = \u03b7Z and by assumption we restrict to solutions with G\u03b7 < 0 we need\nto analyze system (C.5), (C.6) in the region Z > 0 if \u03b7 > 0 and Z < 0 if \u03b7 < 0. On\nthe other hand, G > 0 implies W > 0.\nStandard analysis shows that the phase portrait associated to system (C.5), (C.6)\nis the one in Figure C.1.\nZ~W\nZ~C\/W\nZ~ \\| W_\n| Z | ~ C\/W\n|Z| ~ \\| W___\n___\nFig. C.1. Phase portrait.\nTo draw this phase portrait, it is convenient to introduce a new time variable \u03c3\ndefined by d\u03c3 = d\u03c4W . In this way, the line W = 0 becomes a solution of (C.5), (C.6)\nformed by two stationary points (0, 0), (0,\u22121) and some trajectories connecting them.\nAnother explicit solution is the trajectory corresponding to Z = 0.\nIn the region Z > 0 all the trajectories approach (0, 0) as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e but they have\nthree different behaviors as \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. More precisely, for some of them Z \u223c C1W as\n2198 A. CARPIO, S. J. CHAPMAN, AND J. J. L. VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ\n\u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e and W \u2192 0 as \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. There is another group with the asymptotics\nZ \u223c C2\n\u221a\nW and W \u2192 \u221e as \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Both groups are separated by a unique\ntrajectory with the asymptotics Z \u223cW and W \u2192\u221e as \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\nNear (W,Z) = (0, 0) the trajectories with W > 0 behave like\nZ \u223c ke\u2212 12W asW \u2192 0.(C.7)\nIt is not hard to check that the asymptotics (C.7) imply in the original set of variables\n(C.3) with C < 0.\nOn the other hand, in the G, \u03b7 variables trajectories with the asymptotics Z \u223c C1W\nprovide solutions which vanish at a finite value \u03b70 < 0 verifying as \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b7\u22120\nG \u223c C1(\u03b70 \u2212 \u03b7) 12 .(C.8)\nThe trajectory with the asymptotics Z \u223cW provides a solution of (C.1) such that\nG \u223c k\u03b7 as \u03b7 \u2192 0\u2212.(C.9)\nFinally, trajectories with the asymptotics Z \u223c C2\n\u221a\nW yield solutions of (C.1) such\nthat\nG \u223c A2 \u2212 CA\u03b7,(C.10)\nwhere A is a positive constant which depends on the starting time for the trajectory.\nIn the region Z < 0, a trajectory either reaches (0, 0) as \u03c4 \u2192\u221e or\nZ \u2192 \u2212C\n\u2032\n1\nW\n, W \u2192 0(C.11)\nas \u03c4 \u2192\u221e or is a separatrix trajectory which reaches (0,\u22121) as \u03c4 \u2192\u221e. The asymp-\ntotics of the separatrix are given by Z \u223c \u22121\u2212 12W as \u03c4 \u2192\u221e. All the trajectories in\nthis region Z < 0 satisfy for some C \u20322\nZ \u223c \u2212C \u20322\n\u221a\nW, W \u2192\u221e(C.12)\nas \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\nThe trajectories that approach (0, 0) in Z < 0 yield a solution G satisfying as\n\u03b7 \u2192\u221e\nG \u223c C3 + C4 e\n\u2212 \u03b722k\n|\u03b7|(C.13)\n(compare with (C.3)). The separatrix trajectory approaching (0,\u22121) provides a so-\nlution G vanishing at a finite \u03b70 > 0 in the form G \u223c C5(\u03b70 \u2212 \u03b7) as \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b7\u22120 . Finally,\nthe trajectories satisfying (C.12) provide solutions G with the behavior as \u03b7 \u2192 0+\nG \u223c A\u20322 \u2212A\u2032C \u20322\u03b7.(C.14)\nSelecting A\u2032 = A in (C.10), (C.14) (something that can always be achieved by rescaling\nthe solutions) it follows that the trajectories with C \u20322 = C2 provide a solution to (C.1)\nwhich is global and analytic in the whole line.\nAs we explained in section 5 solutions satisfying the asymptotics (C.9) are not\nvalid to analyze the long time asymptotics of (5.33)\u2013(5.35) with (5.36). Whence, the\nonly valid trajectory is the one with linear behavior at \u03b70 > 0, that is, the separatrix\nindicated in Figure C.1.\nPILE-UP SOLUTIONS FOR CONSERVATION LAWS 2199\nREFERENCES\n[1] E.C.
