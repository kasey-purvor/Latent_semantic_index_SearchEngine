During the 6th August 1995, the CUTLASS\nFinland HF radar ran in a high time resolution mode,\nallowing measurements of line-of-sight convection ve-\nlocities along a single beam with a temporal resolution\nof 14 s. Data from such scans, during the substorm\nexpansion phase, revealed pulses of equatorward flow\nexceeding \u0018600 m s)1 with a duration of \u00185 min and a\nrepetition period of \u00188 min. Each pulse of enhanced\nequatorward flow was preceded by an interval of\nsuppressed flow and enhanced ionospheric Hall conduc-\ntance. These transient features, which propagate east-\nwards away from local midnight, have been interpreted\nas ionospheric current vortices associated with field-\naligned current pairs. The present study reveals that\nthese ionospheric convection features appear to have an\naccompanying signature in the magnetosphere, com-\nprising a dawnward perturbation and dipolarisation of\nthe magnetic field and dawnward plasma flow, measured\nin the geomagnetic tail by the Geotail spacecraft, located\nat L = 10 and some four hours to the east, in the\npostmidnight sector. These signatures are suggested to\nbe the consequence of the observation of the same field\naligned currents in the magnetosphere. Their possible\nrelationship with bursty Earthward plasma flow and\nmagnetotail reconnection is discussed.\nKey words. Ionosphere (Auroral, ionosphere) \u00e1\nMagnetospheric Physics (Magnetotail; Storms and\nsubstorms)\n1 Introduction\nHigh frequency (HF) ionospheric radars have proved to\nbe a successful technique for investigating the spatial\nand temporal development of the ionospheric conduc-\ntivities and electric field in the auroral electrojets, which\nare known to be highly time-dependent (e.g. Kirkwood\net al., 1988) and which combine to produce the\ncharacteristic ground magnetic perturbations during\nthe substorm expansion phase. Dynamic electrojet\nbehaviour, in which ionospheric flows were suppressed\nto values as low as 50 m s)1 and accelerated up to values\nas high as 1 km s)1, has been observed within a few\nminutes, accompanied by conductance variations be-\ntween 20 and 100 S (Morelli et al., 1995), whilst Yeoman\nand Pinnock (1996) observed the evolution of the overall\nconvection pattern on a time scale of only \u001810 minutes.\nRecent high time resolution (14 s) data from HF radars\nduring the highly dynamic substorm expansion phase\nhas revealed a new class of transient convection features\nduring the substorm expansion phase and has related\nthese signatures to the local ground magnetic field\nmeasurements (Yeoman and Lu\u00a8hr, 1997, hereafter\nreferred to as Paper 1). Paper 1 revealed short intervals\nof suppressed flow, followed by the observation of\npulses of more intense equatorward ionospheric flows,\nexceeding \u0018600 m s)1. These pulses had a duration of 3\u2013\n5 min and a repetition period of \u00188 min. Their spatial\nextent in the CUTLASS field of view was 400\u2013500 km in\nlongitude, and 300\u2013400 km in latitude. They were\ninterpreted as signatures of azimuthally propagating\nionospheric current vortices associated with pairs of\nfield aligned currents. These observations of propagat-\ning regions of vortical ionospheric flow are analogous to\nthose seen during the substorm recovery phase in an X-\nband (e.g. Lu\u00a8hr and Schlegel, 1994). They are also\nsomewhat similar to the flows expected in the dayside\nionosphere in association with flux transfer events (e.g.\nLockwood et al., 1990) and the flows associated with\ndayside travelling convection vortex events (Lu\u00a8hr et al.,\n1996 and references therein).\nIn the present study HF radar and ground magne-\ntometer measurements of transient features within the\nionospheric convection and the auroral electrojets are\ncombined with magnetic field and plasma data fromCorrespondence to: T. K. Yeoman\nAnn. Geophysicae 16, 754\u2013763 (1998) \u00d3 EGS \u2013 Springer-Verlag 1998\n\u001810 RE downtail made by the Geotail spacecraft. This\nsuggests the existence of related transient features in the\nmagnetosphere.\n2 Instrumentation\nThe ionospheric convection velocities in this study are\nprovided by the Finland radar of the Co-operative UK\nTwin-Located Auroral Sounding System (CUTLASS).\nCUTLASS is a bistatic HF coherent radar, with stations\nin Finland and Iceland, and forms part of the interna-\ntional SuperDARN chain of HF radars (Greenwald\net al., 1995). The radars form 16 beams of separation\n3.24\u00b0. Each beam is gated into 75 range bins, each of\nlength 45 km in standard operations. During standard\noperations the dwell time for each beam is 7 s, giving a\nfull 16 beam scan, covering 52\u00b0 in azimuth and over\n3000 km in range (an area of over 4 \u00b4 106 km2), every\n2 min. For this interval the Finland radar was operating\na non-standard scan mode. In this mode, rather than the\nusual anticlockwise sweep through beams 15, 14,\n13, . . . , 0 the sequence 15, 9, 14, 9, 13, 9, . . . , 1, 9, 0,\n9 was employed. This allows the construction of full 16\nbeam scans at a reduced temporal resolution of 4 min,\nin addition to the provision of high time resolution\n(14 s) data along a single look direction (in this case\nbeam 9, a beam which approximately overlies the main\nmeridional chain of the IMAGE array). This data set is\nsupplemented here by data from ground magnetome-\nters, provided by stations from two arrays, the UK Sub-\nAuroral Magnetometer Network (SAMNET) (Yeoman\net al., 1990), and the International Monitor for Auroral\nGeomagnetic E\u0080ects, IMAGE) (Lu\u00a8hr, 1994). The in-\nstruments are fluxgate magnetometers. SAMNET has a\nsampling interval of 5 s and the IMAGE array has 10 s\nsampling for the interval under consideration here. The\nIMAGE data is presented in X, Y, Z co-ordinates,\nwhere X is geographic northwards, Y geographic\neastwards and Z is vertically downwards. All data have\nhad a quiet day mean subtracted. The field-of-view of\nthe CUTLASS Finland radar, together with the loca-\ntions of the ground magnetometers used in this study,\nare illustrated in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1 the magnetic local\ntimes of the instrumentation at 21:00 UT are as follows:\nthe western SAMNET stations lie at 21:30 MLT; JAN\nlies at 22:00 MLT; the main meridional chain of\nIMAGE lies at \u001823:30 MLT; the radar backscatter\nobserved in beam 9 of CUTLASS Finland extends over\nan MLT of 23:25\u201323:40. Geotail lies 4 h east of the main\nground instrumentation at 03:30 MLT.\nAt 21:00 UT on August 6th 1995, Geotail was at a\nlocation of X = )9.8 RE, Y = )10.5 RE, Z = 0.8 RE\nin GSM co-ordinates. Data from two Geotail instru-\nments are used here. Spin-averaged vector magnetic field\ndata with a time resolution of \u00183 s are obtained from\nthe MGF instrument (Kokubun et al., 1994) and ion\ndrift, density and temperature data are provided by the\nLow-Energy Particle instrument (LEP, Mukai et al.,\n1994) once every four spin periods (a time resolution of\n\u001812 s). The location of the Geotail spacecraft is\npresented in Fig. 2 along with a field line tracing, using\nthe Tsyganenko T89 model (Tsyganenko, 1990), of an\nimpulsive feature within the CUTLASS Finland field-of-\nview, discussed in detail in Sect. 4.1.\n3 Observations\n3.1 Ground-based magnetic response\nFigure 3 presents an overview of the magnetic field data\nmeasured by Geotail and IMAGE. Figure 3a\u2013d shows\nthe Bx, By and Bz components of the magnetic field,\nbetween 20:00 and 22:00 UT, measured by the Geotail\nspacecraft in GSM co-ordinates, and the total field\nmagnitude, respectively. Figure 3e\u2013h presents the X\ncomponent magnetic field from IMAGE stations BJN,\nSOR, MAS and JAN. Figure 3i indicates the X\ncomponent of the ground magnetic field measured at\nOuluja\u00a8rvi, Finland, bandpass filtered between 200\u201340 s\n(5\u201325 mHz), to highlight Pi2 activity. Pi2 pulsations so\nidentified are marked by vertical lines in the Fig. 3i at\n(\u008b1 minute): 20:08, 20:26, 20:33, and 20:57 UT. The\nFig. 1.

Yeoman et al.: Simultaneous ionospheric and magnetospheric observations 755\nmid-latitude Pi2 measurements are used here to provide\na reference onset time for the substorm onsets\/intensi-\nfications studied in this work (Rostoker et al., 1980).\nThe mid-latitude X and Y component magnetic field,\nas well as timing the substorm onset\/intensification,\nhave been utilised here to determine the longitudinal\nposition of the substorm current wedge (SCW) for each\nonset\/intensification (see e.g. Lester et al., 1983; Yeoman\net al., 1991). The north, X, and vertical, Z, components\nof the magnetic field measured by the higher latitude\nIMAGE stations can be employed in a similar fashion to\nthe SAMNET X and Y component data, to provide\ninformation on the location of the substorm-enhanced\nwestward electrojet (e.g. Kisabeth and Rostoker, 1973;\nSamson and Rostoker, 1983) and hence the latitude of\nthe centre of the electrojet. The high-latitude stations\ncan also give an indication of the longitude of the\nwestward travelling surge.\nThe mid-latitude magnetometer bay structure (not\nshown) provides the following picture of the longitudi-\nnal development of the substorms during this interval.\nAt 20:08 UT a substorm onset was observed to the east\nof the ground magnetometers. This onset was not\ncentred near the auroral zone ground-based instrumen-\ntation employed in this study and no strong current\nsystems are observed local to these instruments, al-\nthough the onset may have been close to the local time of\nthe Geotail spacecraft. At 20:26 UT a stronger substorm\nexpansion phase onset signature was observed. The\nSCW for this event was centred east of the magnetom-\neter arrays, with the upward field aligned current (FAC)\nbetween the longitudes of KVI and NUR. An intensi-\nfication of this substorm occurred at 20:33 UT. Both\nthese onset\/intensifications had magnetic signatures of\nmoderately strong current systems near the auroral zone\ninstrumentation. Subsequent to this a small isolated\nsubstorm onset signature was observed west of the\nground-based instrumentation at 20:57 UT.\nIn Fig. 3 the IMAGE magnetograms reveal a sub-\nstorm-enhanced westward electrojet centred between\nMAS and SOR in the X component magnetic field at\n20:26 UT. This is coincident with mid-latitude magne-\ntometer observations of an upward FAC just to the west\nof the IMAGE stations on Svalbard. The largest\nelectrojet signature observed in the X component for\nthis onset is at SOR. Seven minutes later an intensifi-\ncation of this expansion phase onset is observed, at\n20:33 UT. This intensification causes the electrojet\ncentre, deduced from the strongest negative X compo-\nnent perturbation and a positive Z component pertur-\nbation of the magnetic field at BJN (not shown), to\nmove poleward to just south of BJN. This intensification\nhas also expanded to the west. The substorm onset\nindicated by Pi2 activity at 20:57 UT is not very clear in\nthe IMAGE magnetograms. At JAN, however, 25\u00b0 to\nthe west, the expected decrease in the X component is\nobserved.\n3.2 Geotail data\nThe first significant feature in the magnetic field data at\nGeotail is the sudden decrease in the magnitude of the Bx\nand By components seen between 20:14 and 20:19 UT in\nFig. 3. There is a decrease in the total field magnitude\nfrom \u001825 nT to just \u00185 nT associated with this change.\nAfter 20:19 UT one of the criteria for identifying entry\ninto the inner central plasma sheet (as laid down by\nBaumjohann et al., 1990), specifically that \u0085B2x \u0087 B2y\u00861=2\n<15 nT, is consistently fulfilled. After 20:48 UT, both\nthis criterion and the second criterion of Baumjohann\net al. (1990), that Bz\n\u000e\u0085B2x \u0087 B2y\u00861=2 > 0:5 are both\nsatisfied. Subsequent to this plasma sheet expansion an\ninterval of very turbulent magnetic field is observed\nstarting at 20:51 UT, in addition to a number of\nperturbations in all three components of the magnetic\nfield in the 30 min which follow. It is these features\nobserved within the inner central plasma sheet on which\nwe will concentrate in this study.\nFigure 4 presents details of the magnetic field and\nplasma data between 20:30 and 21:30 UT.

Later the fluctuations in velocity\ncoincide with similar frequency fluctuations in the\nmagnetic field. The lower two panels, g and h, show\nthe ion density and temperature respectively.

In Fig. 5\nan o\u0080set has been applied between the ground-based\nand spacecraft data to gain optimum agreement between\nsimilar features in the convection velocity data and the\nspacecraft data. The proposed relationship between the\nground and spacecraft measurements detailed below is\nnot unambiguous, but we believe it to be highly\nsuggestive of a close link between the observed features.\nThe radar data, taken from instrumentation close to the\nmagnetic local time of the centre of the substorm\nbreakup, lead the Geotail data, and an o\u0080set of +150 s\nhas been applied to the CUTLASS data. In the detailed\nstudy of the ground based signatures presented in Paper\n1, it was demonstrated that the ground magnetometer\nsignature was the response to ionospheric current\nvortices, and as such was produced by a combination\nof the imposed ionospheric electric field (which controls\nthe Doppler velocity measured by the radar), and the\nionospheric conductivities. Paper 1 demonstrated that\nthe optimum agreement between the velocity and\nmagnetic field signatures from the ground instrumenta-\ntion occurred when a magnetic field lead of 70 s was\ntaken into account. Hence an o\u0080set of +220 s has been\napplied to the BJN data in Fig. 5.\nThe main features described here relate to the in-\ncreased pulses in ionospheric convection velocity illus-\ntrated in Fig. 5 a, b at 20:50:00, 20:53:30, 20:59:00,\n21:05:30, and 21:12:00 in shifted-UT, as explained al-\nready, and marked on Fig. 5 by vertical lines. The\nground-based signatures during this interval have been\ndiscussed in detail in Paper 1. The first and third of\nthese features are small and were, in fact, not discussed\nexplicitly in Paper 1, but can be identified in their\nFig. 3. The last two of these features have a very clear\nanalogue in negative perturbations of the Y component\nof the magnetic field at BJN, as expected for an\nequatorward velocity perturbation (poleward conven-\ntional current). The first event at 20:50 UT correlates\nwith some characteristic changes in the Geotail mag-\nnetic field and plasma data. The magnetic field orien-\ntation shows an increase in the angles h and \/ at 20:50\nUT. The magnetic field changes are accompanied by an\nincreasingly negative Vy. No systematic behaviour of\nVx is observed at the five times under study here. These\nchanges represent a dipolarisation of the magnetic field\nat Geotail, a distortion of the field towards the )Y\nGSM (dawnwards) direction and an enhanced dawn-\nwards plasma drift. This pattern of behaviour is\nrepeated for each of the other times marked with\nvertical lines, although no clear dipolarisation is seen\nfor the final interval. The correlation between the\nmagnetic field and plasma data is not completely\nstraightforward. Some intervals of increasingly negative\nVy are seen at times other than those identified above,\nbut they are not accompanied by clear increases in h or\n\/.\n4 Discussion\nGround-satellite measurements of transient phenomena\noccurring during the substorm expansion phase have\nbeen presented. The high-latitude ground-based data are\nrecorded close to midnight, less than 1 h in the pre-\nmidnight sector. Geotail, at L \u0018 10, maps to the same\nmagnetic latitude as the ground magnetometer station\nBJN, but lies some 4 h MLT to the east. A detailed\ncomparison of the radar and ground magnetometer\ndata, represented in Fig. 5 by the BJN Y component\nmagnetic field time series and the line-of-sight velocity\ndata from the overlying radar beam, has been presented\nin Paper 1. The present study concentrates on the\nrelationship between these parameters and the space-\ncraft data. However, a brief review of the deductions\nmade about the ground-based data in Paper 1 is\nrequired before an interpretation can be made of the\ndata presented here, and is included in the following\nsection.\n4.1 Expansion phase ionospheric convection\nThe dynamic features in the line-of-sight velocity from\nbeam 9, range gate 25 of the CUTLASS Finland radar,\nwhich lies close to overhead of BJN, are typically of\n5 min duration, with an inter-pulse interval of about\n3 min. They peak at a line-of-sight flow of \u0018600 m s)1.\nThe polarities of the X and Y component magnetic field\nmeasurements from the IMAGE stations on Svalbard\nand in northern Scandinavia are qualitatively consistent\nwith the picture of a Hall current vortex from a pair of\nfield-aligned currents. Equivalent current patterns de-\nrived from IMAGE stations show at least five vortices\ncentred near BJN, with clockwise and anticlockwise\ncurrent vortices associated with downward and upward\nFACs respectively. The deduced time delay between the\nvortex signatures at the IMAGE stations HOR and\nHOP implies an eastward propagation speed of \u00a36 km\ns)1, and an azimuthal extent of about 1000 km. The\nextent of the features in the magnetotail has been\nestimated using the T89 model, and is illustrated in\nFig. 2 for the feature observed between 21:12 and 21:14\nshifted-UT in Fig. 5a. T89 o\u0080ers only a crude mapping\nof the magnetosphere for such a case study. The model\nis run here for Kp = 0. The prevailing Kp was 2-, but Kp\nhad been \u00a31 for the entire day up to then, and Kp = 0 is\nchosen to minimise the field line stretching in T89. The\nradial extent of the mapping is limited by the limited\nextent of the radar data at high latitudes. The transient\nfeatures are detected 15\u201370 min after the substorm\nexpansion phase onset.\n760 T. K. Yeoman et al.: Simultaneous ionospheric and magnetospheric observations\n4.2 Geotail data\nThe Geotailmagnetic field data has shown the spacecraft\nto enter the inner central plasmasheet at 20:19 UT,\npresumably as a consequence of the expansion of the\nplasma sheet resulting from the nearby substorm onset\nat 20:08 UT. Subsequent to this a number of features in\nthe magnetic field and plasma data at Geotail are\nsuggested to be correlated with the ground observations\nof azimuthally propagating current vortices some four\nhours to the west. The corresponding signature in the\nspacecraft data is a sequence of features showing an\nincrease in the magnetic field angles h and \/. Such\ndipolarisations and variations in By are consistent with\nthe signatures expected from the magnetospheric field\naligned currents associated with the ionospheric current\nvortices observed by the ground instrumentation. The\nenhanced dawnwards plasma drift at Geotail is qualita-\ntively consistent with the azimuthal propagation of the\nionospheric current vortices.\nThe combined ground-satellite magnetic field mea-\nsurements exhibit a similar temporal evolution in the\nrespective By components on either side of local\nmidnight (compare Figs. 4a and Fig. 5c). The signatures\nin both sets of instruments also indicate eastwards\nazimuthal motion. Assuming a common source in the\npre-midnight sector, the dawnwards propagating signa-\ntures are thus observed first by CUTLASS and then by\nGeotail. If the azimuthal velocity of \u00186 km s)1, mea-\nsured from the ground data in the pre-midnight sector,\nis appropriate for propagation between the two instru-\nments, then the azimuthal travel time makes up only a\nsmall part of the observed delay between the expansion\nphase onset at 20:26 and subsequent intensification at\n20:33 UT and the first observation of the transients.\n4.3 Relationship to substorm theories\nThe dynamic variations of ionospheric electric field and\ncurrents, localised FAC systems and magnetotail mag-\nnetic field and ion velocity perturbations presented here\nclearly have important implications for the energetics of\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere coupling during substorms.\nThey may also have implications for the substorm onset\nprocess in the magnetotail. Although there are a number\nof competing substorm onset theories (see e.g. Lui, 1991)\none of the critical issues of recent years has been whether\nreconnection at a near-Earth neutral line (NENL,\nRussell and McPherron, 1973; Hones, 1979) is the cause\nof eventual substorm breakup in the near-Earth mag-\nnetotail (see e.g. Baker et al., 1996 for a recent review) or\nwhether the near-Earth substorm breakup itself triggers\nsubsequent reconnection at a NENL (see e.g. Lui, 1996).\nThere is a considerable body of recent evidence that\nsubstorm onset occurs in the very near Earth region,\nsubsequently propagating tailward (Lopez and Lui,\n1990; Lopez et al., 1993), with reconnection following\nin the more distant magnetotail. However other recent\nstudies have suggested that NENL reconnection is the\nprocess which initiates substorm onset, with the near-\nEarth signatures a consequence of the more distant tail\nprocess (e.g. Baker et al., 1993).\nThe duration, repetition rate and morphology of the\nimpulsive features in the ground-based data presented in\nPaper 1 is very similar to that of flux transfer events on\nthe dayside (e.g. Lockwood et al., 1990), and this might\nsuggest that the source mechanism is transient recon-\nnection at the NENL. If these features are signs of\nreconnection they occur some 15\u201370 min after the\nsubstorm expansion phase onset. This delay between\nexpansion phase onset and the observed vortices seems\nlong if the process causing the vortices is directly related\nto the substorm onset process, although similar delays of\n\u001830 min have previously been observed between sub-\nstorm expansion phase onset and polar cap contraction\nby e.g. Lockwood and Cowley (1992), Yeoman and\nPinnock (1996) and Taylor et al. (1996). The transient\nionospheric and magnetospheric features may have been\nproduced by earthward flowbursts in the tail (usually\ntermed bursty bulk flows or BBFs) such as those\nreported by e.g. Baumjohann et al. (1990) and Angelo-\npoulos et al. (1992), although the azimuthal motion\nsuggests they are an inner-magnetosphere response\ncreated by such rapid, Earthward plasma flow, rather\nthan related directly to it (see Paper 1). The present\nGeotail observations were made at the extreme earth-\nward and dawnward limits of previous BBF observa-\ntions (Baumjohann et al., 1990). The observed velocities\nare much slower and the magnetic and plasma bulk\nmotion signatures are dominated by azimuthal (dawn-\nward) rather than Sunward perturbations. This is\nconsistent with previous suggestions that the region of\nrapid flow is spatially localised, confined to a cross-\nsectional area of the tail of 1\u20132 RE\n2 (Angelopoulos et al.,\n1996). Angelopoulos and co-workers (1996) also postu-\nlated that a deceleration and azimuthal spreading of the\nEarthward plasma flow would occur in the dipolar\nregion of the nightside magnetosphere, which is directly\nsupported by the observations presented here. Azimuth-\nal perturbations of the magnetic field and velocity\nmeasurements associated with BBFs were also discussed\nby Baumjohann et al. (1990), who suggested an associ-\nation with the limited azimuthal extent of the flow\nregion. Some evidence of a systematic relationship\nbetween the direction of the Vy perturbation and the\nazimuthal location of the observing spacecraft, such that\nVy was directed away from the midnight sector, has\nrecently been presented by Sergeev et al. (1996) at a\ndistance of 20 RE downtail, who interpreted BBFs in\nterms of plasma sheet bubbles (Chen and Wolf, 1993),\nprobably caused by reconnection in the magnetotail.\nIndeed, the ground magnetometer features presented\nhere are similar to those of Kauristie et al. (1996), which\nwere again interpreted in terms of plasma sheet bubbles.\nSome theoretical treatments of the onset mechanism and\ndevelopment of the substorm expansion phase require a\nbreaking and azimuthal redirection of the Earthward\nplasma flow in the magnetotail (Haerendel, 1992;\nShiokawa et al., 1997). The data set presented here\nsupports such theories. Shiokawa et al. (1997), however,\ndid not find any direct evidence for such an azimuthal\nT. K. Yeoman et al.: Simultaneous ionospheric and magnetospheric observations 761\nredirection of the Earthward plasma flow in the AMP-\nTE\/IRM dataset.\nThe relative timing and locations of the observations\nof earthward plasma flows and the substorm breakup\nregion clearly have implications for the sequence of\nevents in the magnetotail which lead to substorm\nexpansion phase onset. The data presented here occur\nlate in the substorm growth phase. It remains possible,\nhowever, that similar features occurred in the growth\nphase of the substorm expansions studied here. The\nexamination of a larger dataset will be required to\naddress such issues in more detail.\n5 Conclusions\nData from the CUTLASS Finland HF radar with a\ntemporal resolution of 14 s have revealed pulses of\nequatorward flow during the substorm expansion phase.\nThese flow pulses exceed \u0018600 m s)1 and are observed\nwith a duration of \u00185 min, a repetition period of\n\u00188 min and an eastward azimuthal propagation of\n\u00a36 km s)1. Each pulse of enhanced equatorward flow\nwas preceded by an interval of suppressed flow and\nenhanced ionospheric Hall conductance. These transient\nfeatures are interpreted as being due to ionospheric\ncurrent vortices associated with field aligned current\npairs generated during the substorm expansion phase.\nThe present study reveals that these ionospheric con-\nvection features appear to have an accompanying\nsignature, comprising a dawnward perturbation and\ndipolarisation of the magnetic field and dawnward\nplasma flow, measured in the geomagnetic tail by the\nGeotail spacecraft, located at L = 10 and some four\nhours to the east, in the postmidnight sector. These\nsignatures are suggested to be due to the observation of\nthe same field aligned currents in the magnetosphere.\nThey are suggested to be related to the deceleration and\nazimuthal diversion of bursty Earthward plasma flow\nduring the substorm expansion phase. The case study\nresults presented here are not conclusive, but further\nopportunities to make similar measurements should\noccur soon, following the successful launch of the\nEquator-S mission.\nAcknowledgements.
