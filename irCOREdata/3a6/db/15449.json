Introduction\n[2] Field measurements and remotely sensed data show\nthat the complete visual mixing of flows where two large\nrivers join commonly requires a significant river length\n[Mackay, 1970; Krouse and Mackay, 1971; Matsui et al.,\n1976; Weibezahn, 1983; Stallard, 1987], and that this\ndistance may extend to 10s or even 100s of km (Table 1).\nSemitheoretical analysis [e.g., Fischer et al., 1979;\nRutherford, 1994] suggests that mixing should require a\nsignificant distance downstream, because the rate of trans-\nverse diffusion will scale with W2, where W is the width of\nthe combined channels. However, on occasion, some large\nrivers can visually mix much more rapidly than this (Table 1)\nand our own field observations of the junction of the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParana\u00b4 and R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay in Argentina show that while the\nmixing length can be >400 km (referred to herein as slow\nmixing), it can also be as little as \u00018 km (referred to herein\nas rapid mixing). Research in smaller rivers has shown that\nnear-field processes can reduce mixing lengths substantially\n[e.g., Gaudet and Roy, 1995]. The present paper begins by\nreviewing semitheoretical analyses of river mixing to iden-\ntify the expected mixing lengths at the junction of the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParana\u00b4 and R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay. We then present the first detailed\nmeasurements from a large river confluence in order to\nevaluate the influence of the near-field processes that con-\ntribute to both slow and rapid mixing.\n2. Semitheoretical Analyses of River Mixing\n[3] A significant body of research completed during the\n1960s and 1970s developed semitheoretical models for\npredicting the downstream distance required for the com-\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, F02019, doi:10.1029\/2006JF000745, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Geography, Durham University Science Laboratories,\nDurham University, Durham, UK.\n2School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.\n3Department of Geology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,\nUrbana, Illinois, USA.\n4Department of Geography, University of Illinois at Urbana-\nChampaign, Urbana, Illinois, USA.\n5Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Laboratory, University of Illinois at\nUrbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois, USA.\n6Centro de Ecolog\u0131\u00b4a Aplicada del Litoral, Consejo Nacional de\nInvestigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Corrientes, Argentina.\n7Department of Geography, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario,\nCanada.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2006JF000745$09.00\nF02019 1 of 16\nplete transverse mixing of two confluent rivers (the trans-\nverse mixing distance, Lz). For a conservative tracer that has\nbecome vertically well mixed close to the source (i.e., in the\nnear field), the analysis becomes two-dimensional (2-D)\n[Rutherford, 1994]. If the source is steady, and hence the\nlongitudinal dispersion term negligible, the depth-averaged\ncross-stream (y) velocity is zero, the downstream (x) mean\ndepth, depth-averaged velocity (U) and transverse disper-\nsion coefficient (ky) are constant, and ky\u0002 \" y, the turbulent\ndiffusion coefficient, then:\nU\n@c\n@x\n\u00bc ky @\n2c\n@y2\n; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere c is the tracer concentration. This is the constant-\ncoefficient model of transverse mixing. Solution of this\nequation for the special case of the junction of two rivers\n(i.e., @c\/@y = 0 at y = 0 and y = W) is given by Fischer et al.\n[1979]. For the case where the mixing interface is at\napproximately y = 0.25W, as in the river junction studied\nhere, and with mixing complete to within \u00b15%, then:\nLz \u0006 0:18UW\n2\nky\n: \u00f02\u00de\nEquation (2) allows determination of the effective value of\nky required to reproduce the observed Lz, albeit with some\nuncertainty given that the data in Table 1 are based upon\nvisual data. For the junction of the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 and R\u0131\u00b4o\nParaguay, ky \u0006 5.6 m2 s\u00071 for the slower mixing case (2005)\nand ky \u0006 266.0 m2 s\u00071 for the more rapid mixing case\n(2004). It is normal to nondimensionalize ky by dividing by\ndU*, where U* is the shear velocity, (gdS)0.5, and S is reach\nslope (0.00005 for the Parana\u00b4): for the slower mixing case,\nky\/dU* = 11.8 and for the more rapid mixing case ky\/dU* =\n648.8. Comparison of these values with established\nestimates of ky\/dU* [e.g., Fischer et al., 1979; Rutherford,\n1994] suggests that the slower mixing case is close to the\nrange of experimental results for curved channels, 1 < ky\/\ndU* < 3 [Rutherford, 1994], whereas the rapid mixing case\nis 2 orders of magnitude higher than any values reported by\nRutherford [1994].\n[4] The above analysis determines the effective value of\nky required in (2) in order to reproduce the visually observed\nmixing length, with this distance thus being influenced by\nlocal mixing processes associated with flow at the junction\n(the near field) and mixing associated with far-field pro-\ncesses. Research in small rivers has shown that three\nprimary flow mechanisms contribute to near-field mixing\nat river confluences: (1) shear between the confluent flows\n[Best, 1987], which may lead to the formation of two-\ndimensional vortices with near-vertical axes [Brown and\nRoshko, 1974; Rogers and Moser, 1992] that translate and\nmerge as they are advected and stretched downstream\n[Winant and Browand, 1974; Sukhodolov and Rhoads,\n2001]; (2) helical motions (secondary circulation) associat-\nTable 1.

This restricts attention to mixing at junctions with visually different waters. In some cases, the mixing length was\ninterrupted by a later junction, and mixing length was only measured up to this point. Where field measurements of the same junction are available, a\nsecond distance is provided. The first value is the remotely sensed distance. The second and third values are the field-measured data from the respective\nsources given in the last column. We observed complete mixing in the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay-Parana\u00b4 confluence in 2004, and this is indicated.

Each of\nthese mechanisms may therefore contribute to mixing of the\ntwo confluent rivers. Two-dimensional vortices, with near-\nvertical axes, may lead to substantial lateral transfers of\nfluid between the two combining flows, although observa-\ntions in small channels suggest that this only results in\nmixing as long as the shear between the two flows is\nmaintained [Sukhodolov and Rhoads, 2001; Rhoads and\nSukhodolov, 2001]. Helical circulation may result in sub-\nstantial mixing if the secondary flow cells merge into a\nsingle, channel-scale, helical cell [Rhoads and Sukhodolov,\n2001]. The upwelling of water at discordant bed junctions\nhas been shown to reduce the downstream distance required\nfor complete mixing from approximately 100 multiples of\nchannel width (W) to as little as 25W in small rivers (W <\n10 m) [Gaudet and Roy, 1995].\n[5] All of these speculations concerning the nature of\nnear-field mixing at open-channel confluences have been\nbased upon field, laboratory or computational studies of\nrivers that have small channel widths (<10 m). The analysis\nof effective ky values above, combined with the demonstrat-\ned importance of near-field processes for mixing in small\nrivers, leads to two related questions: (1) For the case of\nslower mixing, why do near-field processes have so little\neffect, resulting in an effective ky value that has a similar\norder of magnitude to that expected for far-field mixing\nalone? (2) In what ways are the near-field processes so\ndifferent, in the same river, such that the effective ky value is\n2 orders of magnitude greater at one measurement period\nthan at a another?\n3. Field Site and Methodology\n[6] To address these questions, we have measured mor-\nphology, flow and sediment dynamics at the confluence of\nthe R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 (basin area to Parana\u00b4-Paraguay junction,\nFigure 1.

We surveyed the rivers in February 2004, when\nthey mixed completely in \u00013.3W, and again in May 2005,\nwhen they mixed in \u0001127W (see Table 2 for flow character-\nistics). The postjunction river channel is 2.8 km wide (W)\nand has a mean depth (d) of \u00016.0 m, giving a W:d ratio of\n\u0001470, or 1 to 2 orders of magnitude larger than that typical\nof small river junctions. The morphology of the junction\n(Figure 2) shows that the bed elevations at the junction are\ndiscordant [Kennedy, 1984], with the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 entering\nthe junction with a bottom elevation about 10\u201315 m above\nthe bed of the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay. Upstream of the junction, the\nR\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay becomes confined by a bedrock constriction\nand is significantly over deepened as the flows combine.\n[7] The momentum ratio (Mr) between the two rivers can\nbe defined as:\nMr \u00bc rPAQPAUPA=rPYQPYUPY; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere: r is density; Q is discharge; U is section-averaged\ndownstream velocity; and the subscripts PA and PY denote\nthe R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 and R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay, respectively. In 2005,\nMr = 3.60, if it is assumed that the densities of the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParana\u00b4 and R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay fluid are the same. In practice, the\nParaguay normally carries a significant fine sediment load,\nand so Table 2 also shows the fluid densities (at 27\u0001C)\ncorrected for the effects of vertically averaged suspended\nsediment concentration, which results in only very small\nchanges in the momentum ratio.\n[8] Two types of data were collected in May 2005: (1) at-\na-point, fixed mooring measurements for 90\u2013120 min at\nvarious distances downstream along the mixing interface\nand (2) additional, moving vessel, transects to assist in the\ninterpretation of these at-a-point data. Data are also reported\nthat were collected in February 2004, when the mixing\ndistance was considerably less (Table 1) and the momentum\nratio lower (Mr = 1.80). The 2004 field season was designed\nto focus upon quantifying the junction morphology and\ngeneral flow structure, rather than mixing in detail, and thus\nno systematic at-a-point fixed mooring data were taken.\nHowever, the section transects surveyed in February 2004\nare spatially coincident with those taken in May 2005 and\nthis facilitates the comparison of a slow mixing field case\n(measurements in May 2005) with a rapid mixing field\nseason (measurements in February 2004).\n[9] Measurements of the 3-D confluence bathymetry and\n3-D flow structure were made from a small vessel using a\nRESON SeaBat 8101 Multibeam Echo Sounder (MBES)\nand an RD Instruments RioGrande 600 kHz acoustic\nDoppler current profiler (ADCP). Both instruments were\nlocated together spatially and temporally using a Leica\ndifferential global positioning system (DGPS) in real time\nkinematic (RTK) mode, which produced an accuracy in\nrelative position (DGPS base station to mobile rover) of\n\u00b10.02 m and \u00b10.03 m in the horizontal and vertical\npositions, respectively. The vessel velocity and track posi-\ntion along predetermined survey lines were monitored\nonline and held as constant as possible during surveying,\nwith the vessel velocity being \u00011 ms\u00071.\n[10] The MBES provided information on the river bed\nmorphology at a centimetric resolution and millimetric\nprecision over scales from ripples superimposed on dunes\nto the entire river reach. MBES measurements were taken\nfor the whole confluence area. The RESON SeaBat 8101\nMBES employed was a 240 kHz system, which measured\nthe relative water depth along 101 beams across a wide\nswath (210\u0001) perpendicular to the track of the survey vessel.\nA combined motion and gyro sensor (a TSS Ltd. Meridian\nAttitude and Heading Reference System (MAHRS)) was\nused to provide full 3-D motion and orientation data for the\nMBES processing, and the DGPS was set to output both\nRTK position and a pulse per second (PPS), which was used\nto remove all latency from the MBES setup. Postprocessing\nof the MBES data was achieved using Caris HIPS to\nproduce the final gridded bathymetric surface of the whole\nconfluence area (Figure 2).\n[11] These MBES bed surveys were accompanied by\nthree-dimensional flow measurements using the ADCP both\nalong predetermined transects and from at-a-point, fixed\nmoored positions. The backscattered signal was split into\nequally spaced 0.5 m vertical bins in 2005. In 2004, in situ\ntests showed that the higher suspended sediment concen-\ntration (Table 2) necessitated use of 1.0 m vertical bins so as\nto overcome some of the impacts of signal attenuation.\nSince all velocities measured by the ADCP were relative to\nthe ADCP, and hence include both flow and vessel velocity,\nthe measured ADCP velocities were corrected for the vessel\nmotion by removing the DGPS-derived vessel velocity,\nthereby producing measurements of the three-dimensional\nflow velocity [cf. Yorke and Oberg, 2002; Muste et al.,\n2004]. In order to reduce potential errors in flow velocity, a\nfive profile (or ensemble) running average was used along\neach individual section transect to determine the final 3-D\nvelocity profiles. Such spatial and temporal averaging\nacross each transect was used in an attempt to remove some\nof the higher-frequency turbulence and DGPS positional\nvariations from the final ADCP transect results.

Moreover, because of the temporal scale of the\nlow-frequency flow variations associated with the velocity\nshear within the confluence, obtaining fully time-averaged\nresults at this site is problematic. For the at-a-point loca-\ntions, the ADCP time series data was not subject to any\naveraging as the errors associated with velocity measure-\nment due to vessel movement (maximum horizontal varia-\ntions in complete fixed point time series were \u00015 m) and\nDoppler noise were far less when the vessel motions were\nvery small compared with flow velocity.\n[12] The ADCP also provided a measure of echo back-\nscatter intensity (in decibels), on the basis of the received\nsignal strength of the returning echo from scattering par-\nticles within the water column for each of the bins in each\nvertical profile. Beyond the near-zone distance (the distance\nfrom the transducer where the beam topology transforms\nfrom cylindrical to conical), the echo backscatter values\nrequire correction for transmitted power, beam spreading,\nand sound absorption. As beam spreading varies linearly\nwith depth, with a fixed system frequency and constant\ntransducer power, sound absorption is thus essentially an\nFigure 2.

Direct point\nsamples of suspended sediment concentration were obtained\nwith a Rutner sampler and used to calibrate the ADCP\nacoustic backscatter values. In 2005, this relationship\nallowed use of the ADCP backscatter signal for measure-\nment of suspended sediment throughout the vertical profiles\nalong each of the transects and through time at the fixed\npositions. This proved more difficult for the 2004 data as a\nresult of the high rates of signal attenuation, and thus we\nonly use backscatter data for the 2005 results in this paper.\n[13] For the transect data from both years, the flow\ndirection was defined by plane rotation during postprocess-\ning to give no net cross-stream discharge [Lane et al.,\n2000]. For the 2005 data, the suspended sediment time\nseries and transects from the ADCP were analyzed by\nlabeling them according to the cumulative frequency distri-\nbution of all suspended sediment observations for each\ntransect. This is done on a by-transect basis as a result of\ndownstream changes in the maximum suspended sediment\nconcentration. We use three labels: 1.0, 0.67 and 0.33, with\nthe concentration boundaries set at 67% and 33% of the\ndistribution. For the 2005 transect data, the rotated down-\nstream and lateral velocities were combined with suspended\nsediment data to determine the downstream and lateral\nsuspended sediment fluxes. For the at-a-point data, we\nundertook a classical Reynolds decomposition of each\nvelocity signal vi (vi = u for downstream, v for lateral,\nw for vertical, see Figure 1) and concentration signal (c) into\ntheir mean (overbar) and deviatoric (primed) components\nvi \u00bc vi \u00fe v0i c \u00bc c\u00fe c0: \u00f04\u00de\nThrough determination of the vic product and integrating\nthis through both time and the flow depth at each\nmeasurement point, the associated suspended sediment flux\nwas determined.\n4. Results\n[14] Here, we explore two mixing processes: (1) that\nassociated with shear-driven turbulence, using data acquired\nduring slow mixing and (2) that associated with channel-\nscale circulation, using data acquired during both slow\nmixing and rapid mixing.\n4.1. Mixing Arising From Shear Between Confluent\nRivers: Case of Slow Mixing\n[15] Figure 3 quantifies the strength of association be-\ntween velocity variations and fluctuations in suspended\nsediment concentration, recorded during the at-a-point\nmonitoring in 2005, when mixing was slow. The negative\ncorrelations at x\/W = 0.034 and 0.070 indicate transport of\nhigher turbidity water from the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay toward the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParana\u00b4 and\/or lower turbidity water from the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4\nmoving toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay. At x\/W = 0.152, these\nnegative correlations have become particularly strong\n(Figure 3), notably at the surface. By x\/W = 0.272, 0.539,\nand 0.712, the negative correlation between v0 and c0 has\nbecome much reduced, and is only really significant at the\nsurface, with the surface correlations being further reduced\nat the latter location. Figure 4a shows the associated lateral\nfluxes, by integrating v0c0 through the vertical. Lateral flux\ndeclines rapidly between x\/W = 0.152 and x\/W = 0.272. The\nexceedance probability plot (Figure 4b) shows almost no\nchange in the distribution of suspended sediment concen-\ntration between x\/W = 0.272 and x\/W = 0.712. As the\nFigure 3. Correlation of the deviatoric values of sediment concentration and the lateral component of\nvelocity (c0 and v0, respectively) plotted against depth below the surface (y\/D, 0, surface, 1 bed), with their\ndistance downstream expressed as multiples of the postjunction width (x\/W in legend). Data are for 2005\nwhen mixing was slow.\nF02019 LANE ET AL.: RAPID MIXING AT LARGE RIVER JUNCTIONS\n6 of 16\nF02019\ndistribution is maintained, the decline in v0c0 must be due to\na decrease in the intensity of shear-induced turbulent mixing\nrather than a decline in lateral suspended sediment concen-\ntrations. Thus, the rapid lateral mixing process induced by\nstrong shear at the river confluence has almost disappeared\nwithin 0.272 multiples of the postconfluence width.\n4.2. Mixing Arising From Channel-Scale Circulation:\nCase of Slow Mixing\n[16] Transect surveys of velocity and suspended sediment\nconcentration obtained in May 2005 show that shear-driven\nmixing processes are not enhanced by channel-scale pro-\ncesses. Three transects are chosen for analysis here,\ncorresponding to x\/W = 0.272, 0.539, and 0.712, respec-\ntively (Figure 2). Figures 5a\u20135f show a core of high\nvelocity flow at x\/W = 0.272, extending from 850 m to\n1500 m along the transect. To the left of 1150 m, there is a\nzone of flow moving toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay (positive\nvalues, Figure 5b) that is also associated with a region of\nturbid water (Figure 5d), which extends through the vertical\nto the surface. This turbid water is also associated with a\nzone of upwelling (positive vertical velocity, Figure 5c). To\nthe right hand side of this feature (1150 to 1400 m) in the\nFigure 4. (a) Lateral flux of sediment from the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay river toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 plotted as a\nfunction of distance downstream (x\/W) and (b) exceedance probability plots to show the distribution of\nsuspended sediment concentrations for x\/W = 0.272, 0.539, and 0.712.\nF02019 LANE ET AL.: RAPID MIXING AT LARGE RIVER JUNCTIONS\n7 of 16\nF02019\ndeepest part of the transect, the flow generally moves\ntoward the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay at the surface (positive directions,\nFigure 5b), and toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 at the bed (negative\ndirections), but neither the near-bed nor near-surface flow\nare continuous over any great distance, and become less\ncoherent beyond 1400 m to the end of the transect. To the\nleft hand side of 1150 m, the flow shallows significantly.\nFrom 800 m, where the section crosses the downstream\nextension of the step in the bed morphology of the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParana\u00b4 (Figure 2), to 1150 m, the flow is generally toward\nthe R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay, aided by the direction of the bed gradient.\nThis effect may explain the upwelling and surfacing of the\nmore turbid water at 1150 m. Flow moving down the face of\nthe step, from the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 to the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay (between\n800 m and 1150 m) meets flow that is, at least at the bed,\nmoving generally from the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay to the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4,\nresulting in upwelling of turbid water to the surface. Thus,\nlarge-scale topographic forcing associated with large-scale\nchannel morphology, such as the downstream extension of\nthe morphological step in this confluence, appears to\nprevent the extension of turbid water at depth from the\nR\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay into the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4, leading to a lack of\nmixing between the two flows.\n[17] Figure 4 shows that the vertically integrated advec-\ntive flux at x\/W = 0.272 was much lower than closer to the\njunction corner. The magnitudes of the downstream and\nlateral flux are plotted in Figures 5a(v) and 5a(vi), and show\nthat the downstream flux that is associated with the region\nof high turbidity, and that extends through the flow depth at\n1150 m, is both high and greater than in the adjacent waters.\nThis region also results in a notable lateral flux (Figure 5f)\ntoward the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay (positive values). Figure 6 plots\nthe cross-stream variation in the vertically integrated fluxes\nfor both the downstream and lateral directions for the\ntransects at x\/W = 0.272, 0.539, and 0.712. Despite the\nvertical suspended sediment concentrations that appear to\ndominate some parts of the patterns of flow type (Figures 5d,\n5j, and 5p), there are clear patterns in both the downstream\nand lateral fluxes. Generally, for each of the transects, the\ndownstream sediment flux is approximately one to 2 orders\nof magnitude greater than the lateral flux, with the lateral\nflux having phases of being both negative (toward the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParana\u00b4) and positive (toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay). The major\nzone of positive flux at x\/W = 0.272 is associated with the\nhigh turbidity at 1150 m described above, although the\nlateral flux is generally negative to the left side of 800 m,\nFigure 5.

The value of laterally\nintegrated lateral flux is almost 2 orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the laterally integrated downstream flux of\n158,900 kgs\u00071.\n[18] At x\/W = 0.539 (Figures 5g\u20135l) there is some\nacceleration of flow as compared to x\/W = 0.272, and the\npatterns in flow direction have also changed. The extension\nof the morphological step in the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 on the left\nside of the channel is notable when compared with transect\nx\/W = 0.272, with a high point in its elevation at 800 m at\nx\/W = 0.539, with the flow appearing to converge on top of\nthe step (Figure 5h). To the left of the step, flow moves\nslowly and has a rightward (positive) direction toward the\nR\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay. To the right of the top of the step to \u00011350 m\nalong the transect, there is the expected leftward movement\nof flow toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 (negative directions), al-\nthough after 1350 m the flow pattern is less coherent with\nflow moving right, from the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 toward the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParaguay (1350 to 1450 m), followed by a region of\nleftward directed flow (Figure 5h). In the x\/W = 0.539\ntransect, the turbid R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay water is generally below\nthe surface (Figure 5j), particularly to the left of 1350 m,\nalthough small pockets of more turbid water extend\nthroughout the flow depth, notably again as the morpho-\nlogical step shallows at 1050 m. The patterns of downstream\nflux (Figure 5k) reveal that the main flux is associated with\nhigher concentration R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay water below the surface,\nmostly to the right side of 1200 m. Lateral flux in the\ntransect (Figure 5l) is mainly associated with movement\nfrom the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 (negative\nvalues). The vertically integrated lateral flux (Figure 6) is\ntoward the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay (i.e., positive) to the left of the top\nof the step at 800 m and largely negative to the right,\nshowing the general trend of flux from the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay\ntoward the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4. However, the fluxes are generally\nsmall, and large-scale topographic forcing by the top of the\nstep may be contributing to keeping the more turbid water\non the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay side of the channel. The zones of more\nturbid water moving toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay are sufficient\nfor the vertically integrated lateral flux to be back toward\nthe R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay for short distances (Figure 6), but the\nlaterally integrated lateral flux is strongly toward the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParana\u00b4 with a value of 11,600 kgs\u00071. The downstream flux\nwas 173,200 kgs\u00071, higher than at x\/W = 0.272, illustrating\nthe flow acceleration described above.\n[19] At x\/W = 0.712, the overall flow velocity has reduced\nslightly (Figure 5m) and the extension of the step, whose\neffects are clearly apparent in Figures 5a\u20135l, is now signif-\nicantly lower in elevation, with its highest point at \u0001680 m.\nThis point marks a clear difference in flow direction,\nindicative of converging flow, with flow moving toward\nthe R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay on the left hand side and toward the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParana\u00b4 on the right side of the top of the step (Figure 5n).\nThe zone of flow moving toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 extends\nfurther toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 at the surface, creating what\nappears to be an angled shear layer (Figures 5m and 5n,\n600\u2013700 m), although it is not clear that the velocity\ndifferential along this interface is sufficient for this to be a\ntrue \u2018\u2018shear\u2019\u2019 layer. Vertical velocities on the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 side\nof this oblique flow boundary are generally upward and\nthose on the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay side are generally more down-\nward, although the magnitudes are generally very low. This\nvertical velocity structure probably explains why the zone of\nhigh turbidity remains confined to the bed, and a zone of\nclear R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 water remains distinct to the left of the top\nof the step (680 m). When compared with x\/W = 0.539, on\nthe right hand side of the top of the step, there are fewer\nFigure 6.

Negative lateral flux indicates flux toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4.\nF02019 LANE ET AL.: RAPID MIXING AT LARGE RIVER JUNCTIONS\n10 of 16\nF02019\ncolumns of water moving toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4. Indeed,\noverall at x\/W = 0.712 there is a weak tendency for flow to\nmove toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay at the surface and toward the\nR\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 at the bed, but this is less coherent than at x\/W =\n0.539. These patterns of turbidity are also reflected in the\ndownstream flux (Figure 6), which is higher at x\/W = 0.712\nthan at either x\/W = 0.272 or 0.539, and is dominated by the\nR\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay side of the river once more. Similar to the flow\ndirection, the lateral flux is predominantly toward the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParana\u00b4 to the right of 650 m (negative), and toward the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParaguay to the left (positive) of 650 m. These values are\nsufficient to result in the vertically integrated lateral fluxes\nbeing positive to the left of the step and negative to the right\n(Figure 6). The laterally integrated flux was 1,100 kgs\u00071\ntoward the Parana\u00b4.\n[20] The above analysis suggests that there are three\nprocesses controlling the mixing downstream of x\/W =\n0.152, where the at-a-point observations of sediment con-\ncentration suggest dramatically lower shear-related mixing\n(Figure 4). The first process is essentially a net result of\nflow structures formed either in the near-confluence zone or\nassociated with turbulent suspension events linked to form\nroughness, and the influence of the morphological step, at\nthe bed. These structures take the form of columns of more\nturbid water that extend toward the flow surface and tend to\nresult in high-magnitude fluxes of turbid water in the\ndownstream direction ((Figures 5bv) and (5cv)). However,\nsince these structures were sometimes associated with water\nmoving from the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay to the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 and vice\nversa, they did not have a particularly large, sustained effect\non mixing. Second, away from the influence of the exten-\nsion of the morphological step on the left hand side of the\nchannel, there was generally a zone of turbid, near-bed flow\nmoving predominantly toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 and a region\nof clearer surface flow moving toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay,\nalthough the latter was sometimes disrupted by the features\ndescribed above. These movements of fluid result in a\ntendency for a net lateral flux of turbid water toward the\nR\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 from the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay, although this was much\nsmaller than the magnitude of the laterally integrated\ndownstream flux in all cases. Third, this second process\ndid not extend throughout the whole postconfluence chan-\nnel, primarily as a result of extension of the step. At the\nupstream transect (x\/W = 0.272), the edge of the step formed\nthe bar top, generating flow divergence, and caused turbid\nfluid to move back toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay throughout the\nfull flow depth. Further downstream (x\/W = 0.539), there\nwas a transition toward flow convergence on the top of the\nstep throughout the flow depth (Figures 5g\u20135l), which\nprevented further movement of the near-bed turbid water\ntoward the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4, perhaps exacerbated by the reverse\nbed slope on the right hand side of the step top. As the flow\ndepth over the step increased with distance downstream (to\nx\/W = 0.712), this flow convergence throughout the flow\ndepth continued, forming an angled boundary between\nwater moving toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay at the surface and\ntoward the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 nearer the bed, but with no clear\nevidence of the velocity shear that would be required to\nenhance mixing further. These observations suggest the\nsignificant influence of strong topographic forcing of the\nflow on the left hand side of the postjunction zone, possibly\naided by the effects of form roughness upon transmission of\nbed effects through the flow depth. Such processes thus\nslow the transfer of more turbid water toward the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParana\u00b4. Turbulent ejections of near-bed turbid water toward\nthe surface, associated with the form roughness, could\ncounter this effect, but do not appear to do so sufficiently\nand thus full width scale mixing of the two flows is not\nenhanced by near-field processes.\n4.3. Mixing Arising From Channel-Scale Lateral\nTransfers: Case of Rapid Mixing\n[21] The data collected in May 2005, and discussed\nabove, were associated with a period when the visual\nmixing length was 100 s of multiples of the postconfluence\nwidth. We were able to compare these results with data\ncollected during February 2004 when the river mixed within\na very short distance (Figure 1b), of approximately 8 multi-\nples of the junction width (Table 1). The principal differ-\nences in flow between 2004 and 2005 are (Table 2): (1) a\nslightly lower combined discharge in 2004 (16,000 m3 s\u00071\nin 2005, 15,300 m3 s\u00071 in 2004); (2) a higher relative\ndischarge in the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay, which produced a momen-\ntum ratio close to half of that in 2005; and (3) a higher\nsuspended sediment concentration in the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay in\n2004 (600 mg L\u00071 in 2005, 1,100 mg L\u00071 in 2004), which\nequates to density ratios (Paraguay: Parana\u00b4) of 1.00066 in\n2004 and 1.00035 in 2005. As noted above, the main\nproblem with sampling in 2004 was that the increase in\nthe suspended sediment concentration made it difficult to\ncalibrate the ADCP acoustic backscatter with sediment\nconcentration. Thus, reliable estimates of suspended sedi-\nment concentration throughout the flow depth and calcu-\nlations of the downstream and lateral flux (e.g., Figure 5)\nwere not possible. However, it was possible to determine\nthe stream-wise and vertical velocities, together with flow\ndirection, for the same transects reported above: x\/W =\n0.272, 0.539, and 0.712 (Figure 7) for a case when it was\nclear that visual mixing was complete in a very short\ndistance downstream (Figure 1b). This rapid mixing case\nreveals a dramatic difference in the nature of flow in 2004\nas compared with 2005. At all three transects, there is the\npresence of much larger-scale and more coherent flow\npatterns, with flow at the bed moving toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4\nand flow at the surface moving toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay. In\nthe corresponding transects from May 2005, when mixing\nwas slow, there was only evidence of surface flow toward\nthe R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay at x\/W = 0.272, and this was spatially\ndiscontinuous. In 2004 at all three transects, flow is con-\nsistently moves toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 at the bed and toward\nthe R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay at the surface, with the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4\ndirected near-bed flow having a lower velocity than the\nnear-surface flow moving toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay\n(Figure 7). The result of this is a marked velocity differen-\ntial, and hence a stronger shear than in 2005, although it\nwould be incorrect to consider this a \u2018\u2018channel-scale flow\ncirculation\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018cell\u2019\u2019 as there is no evidence (Figure 1b)\nthat the flow completes even one half of a helix. Although\nmeasurements of turbidity were not possible in 2004, Figure\n1b shows pockets of turbid water upwelling into clear water\nvery soon after the junction, and this may be associated with\neither this increased shear or turbulence associated with\nlarge sand dunes. In morphological terms, the shape of the\nbed is similar at x\/W = 0.272 and 0.539 (although the\nF02019 LANE ET AL.: RAPID MIXING AT LARGE RIVER JUNCTIONS\n11 of 16\nF02019\nsurveyed length of the transect at x\/W = 0.539 is shorter). In\nsummary, although comparison of the 2005 transects with\n2004 is restricted by the lack of suspended sediment data,\nthe transect data shown in Figure 7 indicate channel-scale\nflow patterns at a time when there was exceptionally rapid\nmixing. In these larger rivers, these data suggest that, for\nsuch rapid mixing to occur, conditions that allow such\nscales of transfer must develop.\n5. Discussion\n[22] From the above evidence, it is possible to evaluate\nthe contribution of near-field processes to river mixing in\nFigure 7. Transect surveys for 2004 of flow speed velocity, flow direction (with respect to transects\noriented to give zero net cross-stream discharge, positive toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay and negative toward\nthe R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4), and vertical velocity (positive upward). Data are presented for three transects (see Figure\n2 for locations), i.e., (a) x\/W = 0.272, (b) x\/W = 0.539, and (c) x\/W = 0.712. Each cross section is viewed\nlooking downstream, i.e., distance is measured from the true left.\nF02019 LANE ET AL.: RAPID MIXING AT LARGE RIVER JUNCTIONS\n12 of 16\nF02019\nrelation to the semitheoretical analysis outlined at the\nbeginning of this paper. A schematic diagram of the main\nfeatures of flow when mixing is both slow and rapid is\ngiven in Figure 8. First, we have quantified the impacts on\nmixing created by the shear instabilities (Figure 8a(i)) that\nformed between the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay and R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4, close to\nthe junction corner. In 2005, these appeared to enhance\nmixing close to the junction corner, but this mixing decayed\nrapidly with distance downstream, and was accompanied by\na rapid decay in the association between lateral flow\nvelocity and lateral suspended sediment concentration\n(Figure 3). When the downstream transects are considered\n(Figure 5), there was no clear difference in flow velocity,\nand hence shear, although there was a relatively diffuse\ntransition at both x\/W = 0.539 and 0.712 between flow on\nthe right of the channel moving toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 and\non the left moving toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay (Figure 8a).\nThis boundary was near vertical at x\/W = 0.539 but was\nangled at x\/W = 0.712, and in marked contrast to the\nsuspended sediment distributions (Figure 5). In 2005, water\nfrom the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay extended underneath that of the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParana\u00b4. However, the horizontally angled plane of shear we\nmeasured when mixing was more rapid in 2004 (Figure 7)\nwas not present in 2005 (Figure 5). The absence of any sort\nof shear layer, despite the presence of a mixing layer, is\ncommonly observed at small river confluences [e.g.,\nRhoads and Sukhodolov, 2001]. Downstream of x\/W =\n0.272, the transect-integrated lateral flux was commonly 2\norders of magnitude lower than the transect-integrated\ndownstream flux. Consideration of the postconfluence\nwidth and position of the mixing interface in 2005\n(Figure 1), suggests about 1.8 km of lateral transfer is\nneeded for complete lateral mixing. However, if the lateral\nflux remains constant at 2 orders of magnitude less than the\ndownstream flux, the downstream length required for mix-\ning must be at least \u0001180 km. This is a similar order of\nmagnitude to that observed in the case of slow mixing in\n2005. Thus, in the absence of significant channel-scale\ncirculation, the turbulence-driven mixing processes appear\nto result in a lateral transfer of momentum that is insuffi-\ncient to cause significant mixing in the near field. While\nturbulence-related shear leads to a local increase in mixing\nrates close to the junction, a rapid decay in shear between\nthe contributing flows is associated with a rapid decay in\nmixing rate.\n[23] Second, we have measured the near-field conditions\nwhen mixing of the confluent flows can be very rapid. In\n2004, this was in only \u00018W, which is significantly more\nrapid than is typically observed in the rapid mixing of small\nrivers [Gaudet and Roy, 1995]. Rapid mixing appears\nrelated to the extension of turbid water from the R\u0131\u00b4o Para-\nguay throughout the flow width (Figure 1b) and underneath\nwater from the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 (Figure 8b(i)). This was accom-\npanied by water moving at the surface from the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4\ntoward the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay (Figure 7), although clear R\u0131\u00b4o\nParana\u00b4 water never reaches the true right bank (Figure 1b)\nand so never completes even half of a full helix. Instead,\nthis circulation sets up a very strong, horizontally angled,\nplane shear layer that was accompanied (e.g., Figure 1b) by\nthe upwelling of more turbid R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay water into the\nR\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4. The presence of an angled shear or mixing\ninterface discriminates the case of slow mixing in 2005\nfrom the more rapid mixing in 2004. In terms of the large\nriver studied here, mixing in 2005 was dominated by\nturbulence-driven processes associated with a near-vertical\nshear layer forming close to the junction corner, but resulted\nin slow mixing rates. In 2004, turbulence-driven mixing\nassociated with a near-horizontal plane shear layer resulting\nfrom one river flowing under the second across the full\nchannel width, resulted in much more rapid mixing.\n[24] The key question that emerges is why does this\nchannel-scale circulation pattern appear in the case of rapid\nmixing and why is it absent when mixing is slow? This is a\nparticularly important question because both empirical ev-\nidence and theoretical analysis suggest that the large width\nto depth ratio in wide rivers may impede the formation of\ncoherent channel-wide secondary flow cells [McLelland et\nal., 1999]. For example, Parsons et al. [2008] found that for\nFigure 8. Schematic diagram to illustrate the near-field flow processes during (a) slow mixing and\n(b) rapid mixing.\nF02019 LANE ET AL.: RAPID MIXING AT LARGE RIVER JUNCTIONS\n13 of 16\nF02019\na braid bar confluence-diffluence in the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4, channel-\nscale secondary circulation cells were absent. They attrib-\nuted this to the high channel width:depth ratio, which\nallowed the effects of form roughness to become dominant.\nIn theory, the magnitudes of the terms in a force balance\nanalysis of confluent flows [e.g., Bradbrook et al., 2000]\nvary as a function of width, depth and velocity. Classic\nrelationships in downstream hydraulic geometry show that\nthe rate of increase of width (with increasing discharge and\nhence distance downstream) is commonly much greater than\nthe rate of increase of either depth or velocity. Additionally,\nif the observation of Leopold and Wolman [1960] that the\nradius of curvature is a linear function of channel width\nholds for larger rivers, the analysis of Bradbrook et al.\n[2000] shows that the low rate of increase of velocity with\ndistance downstream should reduce the magnitude of pres-\nsure-driven channel-scale circulation. Thus, the presence of\nsuch channel-scale circulation is surprising and we explain\nthis in terms of the interaction between bed discordance,\ndownstream topographic forcing and the momentum ratio\nbetween the confluent channels.\n[25] Bed discordance has been shown to have a critical\neffect on the formation of flow structures in small river\nconfluences [e.g., Best and Roy, 1991; Biron et al., 1993,\n1996]. Figure 2 shows that the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 enters the\nconfluence at about half the depth of the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay,\nresulting in a morphological step between the rivers\n(Figure 8b(ii)). Before this morphological step curves grad-\nually to become aligned with the postconfluence channel\n(Figure 8b(iii)), it should allow turbid R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay water to\nmove underneath the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 as the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 flows\nover the step. This situation certainly appears to be occur-\nring in 2005, when we have reliable data on turbidity, with a\ntongue of turbid water extending partially across the chan-\nnel at the bed. However, in itself the observation of the\ninfluence of bed discordance does not explain why the same\nriver with the same discordance has channel-scale circula-\ntion at one time period and not at another. In the case of\nslow mixing, with no channel-scale circulation, the effect of\nbed discordance appears to be countered by the effects\nof downstream topographic forcing associated with the face\nof the step, as it curves to become aligned with the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParana\u00b4 (Figure 2). In 2005, when there was no channel-scale\ncirculation, the changing orientation of the step had two\neffects. First, it appeared to steer the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay flow,\nthroughout its depth, toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay side of the\nchannel (Figure 8a(iii)), and this served to keep the turbid\nR\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay water on the right-hand side of the post-\nconfluence channel. Second, the morphological step estab-\nlished a reverse bed gradient that reduced the ability of the\nmore turbid R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay water to move toward the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParana\u00b4 at the bed. Thus, the effect of the changing step\ndirection in the postconfluence channel was to prevent the\nmixing interface migrating toward the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4 and to\nwork against the effect of the bed discordance in its\ninfluence on the transfer of more turbid water toward the\nR\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4. This process could also be exacerbated by form\nroughness and stronger steering of the flow by the bed as\nthe flow shallows over the step. Indeed, the presence of a\nnear-uniform flow direction throughout the vertical would\nbe significant as it is exactly what Parsons et al. [2008]\nreport for a confluence associated with a braid bar, further\ndownstream in the same river. Parsons et al. [2008] reasoned\nthe highW:d ratio allowed the effects of bed roughness to be\ntransmitted throughout the flow depth and hence permitted\nthe effects of topographic steering of the flow at the bed to\nbecome dominant over any larger channel-scale circulations.\n[26] Given that the flow depth was slightly lower in 2004\nwhen channel-scale circulation was present, the question\nthat arises is why this form roughness did not prevent\nchannel-scale circulation from developing. The answer\nappears to lie with the increased momentum of the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParaguay in 2004, as compared with the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4, as\nexpressed by the momentum ratio (Parana\u00b4:Paraguay;\nequation (2); Table 2): \u00011.8 in 2004 (channel-scale circula-\ntion present) and \u00013.6 in 2005 (channel-scale circulation\nabsent), with the prime factor for this difference being a\nhigher discharge, rather than a higher density, in the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParaguay in 2004. Laboratory [Best, 1987, 1988], field\n[Rhoads, 1996; Rhoads and Kenworthy, 1998; Rhoads and\nSukhodolov, 2001] and numerical [Bradbrook et al., 1998,\n2001] studies of small river confluences have shown that the\nmomentum ratio exerts a critical effect on the interaction\nbetween two confluent streams and also conditions the\neffects of discordance upon flow structure formation\n[Bradbrook et al., 1998, 2001]. Although the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4\nhas a higher discharge than the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay in both 2004\nand 2005, it can be speculated that the higher momentum of\nthe R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay in the case of rapid mixing (2004) allowed\ngreater lateral expansion of the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay into the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParana\u00b4 through: (1) in the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay, a reduction in the\nrelative magnitude of topographic forcing compared with the\ndownstream momentum terms, as a result of the higher\ntransect-averaged flow velocity in the Paraguay and (2) in\nthe R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4, reduced resistance to deflection as a result of\nrelatively lower transect-averaged velocity (Table 2). It thus\nappears that, with the lower 2004 momentum ratio, the\nincreased lateral advection of the momentum of the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParaguay fluid at the bed was able to overcome the reverse\ntopographic forcing of the bed that results from the extension\nof the morphological step on the left hand side of the channel\n(Figure 8b(iv)). Thus, the bed discordance, which allows R\u0131\u00b4o\nParaguay water to move underneath the R\u0131\u00b4o Parana\u00b4, as well\nas the greater relative momentum of the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay,\ncombine to drive the rapid movement of turbid water further\nacross the full postjunction width, and result in both channel-\nscale circulation and mixing within a very short distance\ndownstream. This may have been aided by the higher density\nof the R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay in 2004, associated with the higher\nsuspended sediment concentration. The possible contribu-\ntion of density differences to near-field mixing remains an\nissue that needs further research.\n[27] This discussion provides detailed evidence of how\nnear-field processes can lead to the formation of channel-\nscale flow structures at the junction of a large river, which\nappears to have resulted in an exceptionally rapid rate of\nmixing in 2004. However, since we presently only possess\nmeasurements at two momentum ratios, development of a\npredictive model from our data for estimating how near-\nfield effects reduce downstream mixing lengths is not\npossible. Similarly, measurements at a greater number of\nmomentum ratios are required to assess whether there is a\ngradual relationship between the change in momentum ratio\nand mixing length, or a critical threshold in the momentum\nF02019 LANE ET AL.: RAPID MIXING AT LARGE RIVER JUNCTIONS\n14 of 16\nF02019\nratio that discriminates between very rapid mixing and\nmuch slower mixing. Field data may help here, but mea-\nsuring such large rivers is time consuming, expensive and\nlogistically difficult, and the momentum ratio cannot be\ncontrolled in the way it can in physical or numerical models.\nSince a critical variable appears to be the high W:d, it is\nunlikely that physical modeling can address the full range of\nrequired boundary conditions, and thus it will be essential to\nreproduce and extend the type of modeling approach\ndeveloped by Bradbrook et al. [2001] for high values of\nW:d, in order to help to understand and to predict how\nmomentum ratio interacts with bed discordance to deter-\nmine downstream mixing rates. Bradbrook et al. [2001]\ndesigned numerical experiments for small river junctions in\nwhich the effects upon flow structures of different combi-\nnations of junction asymmetry, junction angle, momentum\nratio and depth ratio (i.e., level of bed discordance) were\nsimulated numerically. These experiments showed those\ncombinations of conditions which produced the strongest\nchannel-scale secondary circulation and hence the most\nrapid mixing rates. Following from the conclusions of\nBradbrook et al. [2000], development of a simple predictive\nmodel for near-field impacts may not be possible because\nthese impacts are sensitively dependent upon the precise\ncombination of driving variables, such as momentum ratio\nand local junction bed morphology. We have very few\ndetailed measurements of three-dimensional geometry and\nflow processes in the World\u2019s largest rivers, and only one\ndetailed measurement of the bed morphology of a large\nriver confluence (Figure 2). This restricts the extent to\nwhich we can speculate on the role that is played by bed\ngeometry. However, since river width scales with bankfull\ndischarge [Leopold and Maddock, 1953], and bankfull\ndischarge scales with basin area [Emmett, 1975], as rivers\nbecome larger there is a greater probability that they will\ndiffer in terms of their discharge because of: (1) differences\nin basin area and (2) basin areas that capture different\nclimatic regimes and topographic and lithological terrains,\nand hence experience different discharge fluctuations within\nand between years. If rapid mixing requires particular\nvalues of momentum ratio (in relation to a particular bed\ngeometry), then the extent to which these values are\nobtained will be controlled by time-varying, basin-scale\nprocesses. If we apply an ergodic hypothesis to the data\nshown in Table 1, the required momentum ratios are\nproduced for only a very small proportion of time, and thus\nrapid mixing may be expected to occur rarely.\n6. Conclusions\n[28] The present paper has shown that the distances\nrequired for mixing at large river junctions are often long,\nbut can be very short, even within the same junction at\ndifferent times. When mixing at the confluence of the R\u0131\u00b4o\nParana\u00b4 and R\u0131\u00b4o Paraguay required a longer downstream\ndistance, more than 100 multiples of postconfluence width,\nnear-field mixing was restricted to instabilities generated\nalong the near-vertical shear layer between the two flows. In\nthis case, the associated lateral flux decayed rapidly down-\nstream because of lessening of turbulent shear between the\ntwo confluent flows. Such slow mixing was also associated\nwith an absence of channel-scale circulation. However,\nwhen mixing occurred in a strikingly short distance down-\nstream, the primary cause was the presence of channel-scale\nflow circulation in the near field at the confluence, which\nallowed water from one river to penetrate fully underneath\nthe other flow. In this case, the reasons for this circulation\nare a change in the momentum ratio, in relation to the\neffects of both bed discordance at the confluence and the\nway in which river morphology downstream of the junction\neither enhances or slows mixing. The latter is aided by the\nhigh W:d ratio, which allows easy transmission of bed\ntopographic forcing throughout the complete flow depth.\nOur results present the first detailed data concerning the\ndynamics of mixing at a large river junction, and highlight\nthe clear need for further investigation, most fruitfully\ncombining field study with numerical simulations, to ex-\nplore the fuller range of boundary conditions that may lead\nto slow or rapid mixing at these key nodes in fluvial\nnetworks.\n[29] Acknowledgments.
