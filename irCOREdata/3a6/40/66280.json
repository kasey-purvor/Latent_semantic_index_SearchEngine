Unlike\ncontemporary oil industry practice, in which seismic data are now\nroutinely collected as 3-D data sets and processed and migrated to\nproduce accurate depth images of the subsurface, seismic reflection\nimages of the deep crust are usually collected along single pro-\nfiles. The cost of collecting 3-D data sets across deep structures is\nprohibitive, particularly on land, and especially if the data are to\nhave sufficient coverage to account for migration aperture. Wher-\never possible, the 2-D profiles are oriented in a dip direction so that\nthe structures being imaged can be assumed to be continuous out\nof the plane of the seismic section. On occasions cross lines are\nrecorded to monitor out-of-plane changes in reflector geometry, or\nparallel lines are recorded, but too few are recorded and they are\nspaced too far apart to allow migration of the seismic data out of\nthe plane of the seismic sections. Invariably, therefore, the data are\nprocessed and interpreted assuming that the structures being imaged\nare 2-D, and any effects of out-of-plane energy are ignored when\nthe data are interpreted.\nThe impedance contrasts that give rise to strong reflections\nfrom the deep continental crust have been attributed variously to\nshear zones, mafic underplated rocks and fluid-filled cracks (e.g.\nMatthews & Cheadle 1986; Klemperer et al. 1987; Warner 1990;\nBrown et al. 1996; Makovsky et al. 1999). None of these are likely\n490 C\u00a9 2006 The Authors\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nNo claim to original Crown copyright works\nThe effects of three-dimensional structure 491\nto be truly 2-D in shape. This research was stimulated by a study\nof why shear zones appear the way they do in seismic sections.\nShear zones often appear in seismic sections as laterally continuous\nbands of discontinuous reflections. The bands can extend for sev-\neral hundred milliseconds on seismic time sections. We compared\nsynthetic seismograms with data from a subhorizontal detachment\nsurface in the Archaean Yilgarn Block in Western Australia. The\ndetachment represents a structure for which several simplifying as-\nsumptions can be made in the modelling, as discussed below, al-\nthough we believe the results have universal application. This paper\nfocuses on the geometry of the reflections. The effects on reflector\namplitude are addressed elsewhere (Drummond et al. 2004). The\nmodels and synthetic data would be representative of both faults\n(e.g. one rock type juxtaposed against another with a different seis-\nmic impedance) and broader shear zones in which highly strained,\naltered and anisotropic rock would anastomose between and around\nblocks of protolith (Jones & Nur 1982, 1984; Law & Snyder 1997).\nHowever, the models would equally be representative of other types\nof geological features with similar types of geometry, for example,\nsills, fluid-filled cracks and the Moho if it occurs as crustal rocks\nabove mantle rocks.\nSimilar studies of this type have been attempted in the past.\nBlundell & Raynaud (1986), Raynaud (1988) and Cao & Kennett\n(1989) generated synthetic seismograms for reflections from sur-\nfaces with regular topography in the form of cosine functions. Cao\net al. (1991) introduced randomly irregular surfaces. Fountain et al.\n(1984) and Blundell (1990) studied synthetic models of shear zones\nin which they attempted to include lateral variations in the thick-\nness of interleaved protolith and deformed rock. All of these stud-\nies demonstrated that surfaces with 2-D and 3-D topography can\nproduce waveforms in seismic sections that appear more compli-\ncated that the geometries of the reflecting surfaces. In particular,\nthe stacked data were dominated by diffracted energy. None of the\nsynthetic seismograms from these studies were migrated, because,\nin general, the modelling algorithms did not generate accurate esti-\nmates of the reflection and diffraction amplitudes. Therefore, none\nof the studies produced synthetic seismic sections that could be\ncompared directly with the input model. Nor did the studies allow\nthe interpreter to discriminate between in-plane and out-of-plane\nenergy. Nevertheless they contributed to an intuitive feel for the\nlikely reflection signature of shear zones in stacked seismic sec-\ntions. A study by Mufti (1990) used a 3-D finite difference algo-\nrithm to model out-of-plane reflectivity for a basin setting but the\npaper is largely concerned with the managing of the large computer\nresources required for this program. More recently, Novais & Santos\n(2005) were still addressing the computer resource problem with a\n2.5-D finite difference modelling program, which by definition can-\nnot model out-of-plane reflectivity.\nIn our study, we used the phase-screen method as implemented by\nWild & Hudson (1998) and Wild et al. (2000) for calculating the syn-\nthetic seismograms. The phase-screen method generates synthetic\nseismograms in which the amplitudes of the arrivals are sufficiently\naccurate to allow migration of the reflection sections and, for the\nfirst time, allows computation of synthetic seismograms on a desk-\ntop workstation for large and complex 3-D models. We generated\ndata for 3-D models but we migrated the data in 2-D to provide\ninsight into how shear zones should appear in deep crustal profiles,\nhow we might identify them, and whether we can discriminate the\neffects of internal structure in the shear zone from reflections from\nother sources. This paper follows previous work by Hobbs (2003),\nwhich used synthetic data generated by the phase-screen method\nto look at reflectivity associated with crust formation at an oceanic\nspreading centre.\nWe demonstrate that the effects of even small amounts of out-of-\nplane structure can significantly distort the geometry of reflections.\nAs expected, the distortion cannot be removed through data process-\ning, including 2-D migration. In deep seismic reflection imaging,\nusing single 2-D profiles, we must therefore learn to recognize and\naccount for the effects of out-of-plane reflector topography. We erect\na set of tests that could be applied to stacked and migrated seismic\ndata from 2-D seismic profiles that may provide insight into whether\nout-of-plane structure is affecting reflection geometry.\nA N E X A M P L E O F S H E A R Z O N E S\nR E F L E C T I O N S\nFig. 1 contains stacked and post-stack migrated seismic images of\npart of a regional detachment in the Eastern Goldfields Province\nof the Archaean Yilgarn Block in Western Australia. The sections\nhave no vertical exaggeration. The detachment has been imaged in\na number of regional 2-D seismic profiles and extends over 100 km\nin an east\u2013west direction (Swager et al. 1997) and for a comparable\ndistance north\u2013south (Goleby et al. 2000). Its depth ranges from 3\nto 8 km, but it probably formed below 10 km depth before regional\nuplift and erosion occurred that brought crystalline rocks to the\nsurface. It separates regional shortening and strike slip faulting in\nthe upper crust from similar effects at a different length scale in the\nmiddle to lower crust (Drummond et al. 2000).\nDetachment topography can best be described as a series of sub-\nhorizontal segments at different depths joined by ramps. Fig. 1 shows\none of the subhorizontal segments. Gravity modelling using the ge-\nometries of rock bodies constrained by seismic reflection data and\ndetailed structural mapping suggests that rocks of similar density lie\nabove and below the detachment in this region (Swager et al. 1997).\nAlso, the seismic reflection data do not require different seismic ve-\nlocities above and below the detachment in this region. Therefore,\nthe reflectivity of the detachment in this region is likely to arise\nfrom the intrinsic reflectivity of the detachment, and not from the\njuxtaposition of rocks of different seismic impedances on either side\nof the detachment. The detachment is, effectively, a subhorizontal\nshear zone. However, the detachment does have some limited local\ntopographic relief, requiring us to study how small scale topogra-\nphy on the reflector can affect the seismic images of the shear zone.\nBecause it is subhorizontal in this area, we can ignore the regional\ndip on the reflector and the effects this might have on the positions\nof the shear zone in stacked and migrated images when considering\nsynthetic examples.\nThe top of the reflections from the detachment lies near 2.5 s\ntwo-way traveltime (TWT) in Fig. 1(a) and the reflections extend\nin TWT for 300\u2013400 ms. The dashed hyperbolas plotted near the\nlabels P\u20321 and P\n\u2032\n3 are calculated diffraction curves for the plane of the\nsection. They highlight diffractions that extend from the bottom of\nthe band of energy reflected from the detachment. The crust below\nthe detachment in this region is mostly non-reflective except for\nisolated diffractions, such as P\u20322 and P\n\u2032\n4, for which the theoretical\ndiffraction curves for this section are plotted as dashed lines.

R1\u2013R3 are label reflections.\nand reflection character of the detachment surface in Fig. 1 are\nrepresentative of the signature of the detachment surface regionally,\nand, we believe, of many other shear zones. That is, shear zones\ngenerally appear as semi-continuous bands of strong reflections in\nwhich individual reflections are not continuous across the full lateral\nextent of the band.\nThe preservation of pseudo-true amplitudes in Fig. 1(a) allowed\nthe data to be post-stack migrated at stacking velocities to produce\nFig. 1(b). The overall signature of the detachment has been preserved\nin the migrated section; that is, it still appears as a continuous band\nof discontinuous reflections with a TWT thickness of 300\u2013400 ms.\nThe top of the envelope of reflections from the detachment has of\nthe order of 100 ms (TWT) topography, as in the stacked section,\nalthough the topography is greater where the ramp upwards begins at\nR2 at the right-hand side of the figure. Note that all diffracted energy\nhas collapsed to small zones, or effectively points. P\u20321 and especially\nP\u20323 lie within the envelope of reflections from the detachment, with\nno energy extending downwards from the envelope of detachment\nreflections. Note also that P\u20322 and P\n\u2032\n4 lie up to 500 ms below the top\nof the band of reflections from the detachment, and around 200 ms\nbelow the bottom of the band.

In order to understand the synthetic examples, it is useful to\nconsider first the effects of a single point reflector.\nAssume that P is a point reflector (diffractor) outside the plane of a\n2-D seismic section (Fig. 2a). P lies in a medium with a homoge-\nneous and isotropic velocity v. The TWT of reflections from P is,\ntherefore, a linear function of the distance of the observation point\nfrom P.\nIn Fig. 2(a), the plane of the seismic section is through the origin\nand lies along the X axis. P lies at the coordinates (0, y1, t 1); that\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 164, 490\u2013500\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nNo claim to original Crown copyright works\nThe effects of three-dimensional structure 493\nFigure 2. (a) Hyperbolic surface representing the shape of the diffraction\nfrom a point P lying out of the plane of the seismic section. (b) Cross-\nsection normal to the plane of the seismic section showing the scenarios in\nwhich reflected energy from out of the plane of the section will be recorded\nbefore or after the reflection from in the plane. Dashed semicircle shows\nintersection of the plane of the diagram with a hemisphere centred on O and\npassing through the intersection of the reflector with the plane of the seismic\nsection.\nis, it lies on the Y axis at time t 1 = z1\/v and at a distance y1 from\nthe origin. The traveltime t from any point Q(x,y,0) on the Earth\u2019s\nsurface to P is defined by the equation\nt = Q P\nv\n=\n\u221a\nx2 + (y \u2212 y1)2 + z21\nv\n, (1)\nwhere QP is the distance from the observation point Q to the point\nP.\nThis is a hyperbolic surface, as shown in Fig. 2(a). To migrate\naccurately the energy reflected from point P, all energy along this\nsurface should be migrated in 3-D. However, in 2-D seismic imaging,\nonly the energy in the plane of the section is migrated, based on the\nassumption that all energy in the section results from reflectors in\nthe plane of the section.\nAt the origin (x = y = z = 0), the hyperbolic surface will be at\na depth OP \u2032 such that\ntOrigin = O P\n\u2032\nv\n=\n\u221a\ny21 + z21\nv\n. (2)\nThe hyperbolic surface intersects the plane of the section at y =\n0, so that from eq. (1), it cuts the plane of the section along a 2-D\nhyperbola of the form\nty=0 =\n\u221a\nx2 + y21 + z21\nv\n=\n\u221a\nx2 + O P \u20322\nv\n. (3)\nThis is also the equation for a diffraction in the plane of the section\nfrom point P\u2032. Therefore, in the plane of the seismic section, the\ndiffraction from point P produces a hyperbolic event which will\nperfectly migrate in 2-D with the correct velocity, v, to a point at\nP\u2032, but point P\u2032 is not the true origin of the diffraction and is at a\nspurious depth determined by the distance of the 2-D section from\nthe original diffraction point P.\nImplications for a point reflector\nWhen using 2-D imaging and 2-D migration, we expect that energy\nfrom within the plane of the section will migrate to its correct po-\nsition. However, eq. (3) demonstrates that energy from outside the\nplane of the section will also appear to migrate correctly. That is,\nreflected energy from out of the plane of the section migrates within\nthe plane of the section, but the TWT and, therefore, the apparent\ndepth of the reflector is different from its true depth out of the plane\nof the section. In this case it is deeper.\nIn Fig. 1, the diffracted energy labelled P\u20321 to P\n\u2032\n4 might be ex-\namples of energy reflected from the detachment out of the plane of\nthe seismic section that plots below the position of the detachment\nin the plane of the section. The tops of the diffraction hyperbola\nfor P\u20321 and P\n\u2032\n3 lie just below the top of the envelope of energy from\nthe detachment, and the diffractors, therefore, would be close to\nthe plane of the section. The top of P\u20322, however, lays approximately\n0.5 s (TWT) below the top of the envelope. If it is an out-of-plane re-\nflection from topography on the detachment interface, then it would\noriginate from a portion of the detachment lying approximately\n5.2 km out of the plane of the section.\nBehaviour of a reflector with out-of-plane topography\nA 3-D subhorizontal reflector with topography can be considered\nin terms of the behaviour of a series of point diffractors on the\nreflector. The time at which energy from out of the plane of the\nsection will plot within the section is examined using Fig. 2(b),\nwhich shows diagrammatically the intersection of the plane of the\nseismic section (x = 0 km) with a subhorizontal reflector. Fig. 2(b)\nis a cross-section orthogonal to the plane of the seismic section.\nIn general terms for an isotropic homogeneous subsurface, out-of-\nplane reflections will fall below the in-plane reflection if r > z (as\nis the case for point R1), at the same time as the in-plane reflection\nif r = z (and reinforce the amplitude of the in-plane reflection), and\nabove the in-plane reflection if r < z (as is the case for point R2).\nIn the plane of Fig. 2(b), the equation r = z represents a semicircle\ncentred on the observation point O, with a radius equal to the depth\nof the reflector in the plane of the section z. In 3-D, it represents\na hemispherical surface. In general, we expect energy from out-\nof-plane reflections will fall below the in-plane energy, that is, the\nreflection point lies outside the hemisphere. However, situations\nwill exist where the reflector has sufficient out-of-plane relief, A,\nthat parts of it lie within the hemisphere as defined by\nA > z \u2212\n\u221a\nz2 \u2212 y2, (4)\nthen the out-of-plane reflected energy from those parts will arrive\nbefore the in-plane energy.\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 164, 490\u2013500\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nNo claim to original Crown copyright works\n494 R. W. Hobbs, B. J. Drummond and B. R. Goleby\nBehaviour for non-homogeneous earth models\nThe analysis can be extended to encompass more general situations\nwhere there is a velocity gradient in the subsurface or low-velocity\nsedimentary layer at the surface. The imaging of out-of-plane en-\nergy is a function of the mean velocity between the profile and the\nout-of-plane diffraction point, the stacking and migration veloci-\nties in the 2-D section at the traveltime where the diffracted energy\nintersects with the section, and the distance of the diffractor from\nthe profile. Stacking velocity becomes poorly constrained when the\ntarget depth exceeds the survey aperture, that is, there is not enough\nof the hyperbolic move-out curve recorded, and also temporal res-\nolution is reduced because of preferential loss of high-frequency\ncontent due to effective Q. This statement can be recast as: stack-\ning cannot discriminate between two events at the same TWT if the\ndifference in stacking velocity is such that, at the maximum offset\nincluded in the stack, the difference in the NMO curve is less than\nhalf the minimum period of the source wavelet. By analogy a similar\nrule can be constructed for the migration operator, which means a\nmigration operator will focus energy for two different diffractions\nprovided the migration velocity difference is such that, at the max-\nimum migration aperture, the time difference is less than half the\nminimum period of the source wavelet; here the aperture is affected\nby both acquisition and processing parameters. For deep seismic\nimaging both these conditions are fulfilled and we would expect the\ndeep 2-D image to represent the reflectivity from a swath centred\non the profile. The relationship between the aperture x (either the\nhalf-width of the migration aperture or the stack aperture) and the\nrms velocity in the plane of the section, v 1rms, at the time where\nthe out-of-plane diffracted energy intersects with the profile, t 0 is\ngiven by\nx2 \u2248 t0T(\n1\nv22rms\n\u2212 1\nv21rms\n) , (5)\nwhere v2rms is the rms velocity to the out-of-plane scatter, and T\nis the dominant period of the source. This assumes that velocity\nincreases with depth. The swath half-width can then be determined\neither by numerical methods given an arbitrary velocity\u2013depth curve\nor analytically for predefined functions (Al-Chalabi 1997). If, for\nthe data shown in Fig. 1, we use a linear velocity depth relation-\nship with a surface velocity of 6.3 km s\u22121 and a velocity gradient of\n0.022 s\u22121, an aperture of 10 km and a maximum frequency in the\nsource wavelet of 60 Hz, then the swath half-width would be about\n3 km at a depth of 8 km. This swath half-width will be reduced\nin cases when the aperture is increased, the traveltime is reduced,\nthe source has higher frequency content or there is a higher veloc-\nity gradient. Changes in the opposite sense will increase the swath\nhalf-width.\nS Y N T H E T I C E X A M P L E S\nFrom the above, the interpretation that energy at P\u20321 to P\n\u2032\n4 in Fig. 1\ncould be reflected from out-of-plane segments of the detachment\nis possible. Nevertheless, apart from recording more field data, we\nhave no means of confirming the interpretation. The behaviour of\nout-of-plane energy can be studied more robustly by considering\nsystematically a set of synthetic seismograms for known models of\ndiffering levels of complexity.\nA reflector surface of the type described in Appendix 1 and shown\nin Fig. 3 was created. The maximum peak to trough topography on\nthe surface was scaled to 250 m, but along any profile through the\nsurface the maximum range would typically be less. The model\nFigure 3. Surface of the form described in Appendix 1, from which a model\nof a shear zone layer was developed for subsequent synthetic seismogram\nmodelling.\nused was 12.7 km square. This surface has a dominant wavelength\nof 4.2 km in the X direction and 5.1 km in the Y direction; these\nare similar to the wavelengths of the topography on the detachment\nin Fig. 1. The surface also includes a range of shorter wavelengths\nwith smaller amplitudes and random phase shifts, so that it has a\nroughness that generates reflections from out of the plane of the\nseismic section.\nThe surface was then used to construct a layer to represent a\nfault or thin shear zone by assigning a high seismic impedance\n(2000 kg m\u22122 s\u22121) between two identical surfaces 50 m apart in\ndepth. For the initial model, this layer was set in a homogeneous\nmedium with a seismic velocity of 6.4 km s\u22121. The layer was cen-\ntred on 9 km depth, or around 2.8 s TWT, similar to the detachment in\nFig. 1. Fig. 4(a) shows the layer in cross section. An identical thick-\nness horizontal reference layer with equal impedance was placed\nat 7.92 km depth. With the data processed so that the amplitudes\nof the reference reflector were the same from the section from this\nmodel and sections from subsequent models discussed below, direct\ncomparisons could be made between the amplitudes of reflections\nfrom a range of shear zone models. As shown in Fig. 4 and in later\nfigures, the synthetic data have been plotted with a high gain to high-\nlight diffracted energy. Therefore, the amplitudes of the reference\nreflection are clipped. The reader should use a comparison with the\nreference reflector with care; however, the clipping to reference am-\nplitudes is only in the plotting process, and comparison of the shear\nzone reflector amplitudes between sections is valid.\nIn this study, two methods were used to calculate synthetic seis-\nmograms. In the first, a series of common shot gathers were cal-\nculated, sorted into CMP gathers and stacked. Secondly, synthetic\nseismograms were calculated along the same profile using an ex-\nploding reflector approach. This gave similar results to the CMP\napproach, and was computationally faster, so it was used for the cal-\nculation of all synthetic seismograms presented in this paper. The\nuse of exploding reflector models (Loewenthal et al. 1976) is an ac-\ncepted method to compute zero-offset data provided multiples are\nignored as these will have the wrong traveltime (Claerbout 1985).\nSynthetic seismograms were calculated for a range of models in\nwhich the amount of structural complexity in the shear zone was\nsystematically increased.

That is, in order to simulate the conditions for regional 2-D\nseismic reflection surveys.\nTwo-dimensional reflector\nSynthetic seismograms were calculated first for a 2-D model gener-\nated using the cross-section of the shear zone in the plane of the sec-\ntion. The model is shown in Fig. 4(a). The stacked section (Fig. 4b)\nshows concave downwards reflections across each antiform in the\nmodel, and characteristic strong diffractions below and to the sides\nof the synclinal parts of the shear zone. These diffractions have a\nform traditionally termed a \u2018bow tie\u2019, and each syncline generates\none bow tie. When migrated (Fig. 4c), the synthetic data reproduced\nthe shear zone geometry very well as a single reflection, apart from\nregions of numerical noise caused by the edge of the model and the\nresulting asymmetry in the diffractions at each end of the section.\nThe migrated section in Fig. 4(c) provides a basis for comparison\nwith sections from more structurally complex shear zone models.\nThree-dimensional reflector\nSynthetic seismograms were then calculated for a 3-D layer. The\ncross section in the plane of the seismic section for this model is the\nsame as that in Fig. 4(a), but in and out of the plane of the section\nthe shear zone layer has the topography shown in Fig. 3.\nThe geometry of the top of the reflections is dominated by an-\ntiforms and in the stacked data (Fig. 5a) appears similar to that for\nFigure 5. Seismic section from a 3-D shear zone layer. (a) Stacked and (b)\n2-D Migrated data \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018C\u2019 in (b) are pointers to features discussed\nin the text.\nthe 2-D model in Fig. 4(b). However, the pattern of diffractions be-\nlow the first reflections in Fig. 5(a) is not as simple. The bow ties\nthat are present in Fig. 4(b) are also present in Fig. 5(a), but bow\ntie diffractions from synclinal keels outside the plane of the section\nare also present in the plane of the section. They inter-mingle and\ninterfere with diffractions from the reflecting layer in the plane of\nthe section. This is particularly clear under the synforms at the left\nand in the centre of the section.\nThe resultant differences in the migrated sections are quite\nmarked. The dashed curve in Fig. 5(b) marks the bottom of the\nreflection in Fig. 4(c) from the 2-D reflector, and facilitates compar-\nison of the two sections. In Fig. 4(c) no energy arrives below this\nlevel, in contrast with Fig. 5(b). The reflection from the 3-D shear\nzone layer is not a continuous first arrival reflection as in Fig. 4(c),\nalthough the dashed line allows identification of a reflection that\nmarks the approximate position of the reflector. A first arrival re-\nflection persists laterally across the centre and right of the seismic\nsection, for example, below \u2018C\u2019 in Fig. 5(b). It comes from regions\nof the shear zone layer with topographic variations that are mod-\nerate and return out-of-plane energy that falls below the in-plane\nreflection. For the shear zone layer along the seismic section, the\nvalues in eq. 3 are A \u2248 0.22 km, y = 2.5 km, and z \u2248 9.07 km.\nThe right-hand side of eq. (4) equates to 0.35 km, which is greater\nthan A for this section. Therefore, along the bulk of the section,\nthere is insufficient out-of-plane relief to cause reflections from out\nof the plane to plot above the expected position of the reflector in\nthe plane of the section.\nHowever, at the left-hand end of the section, just below \u2018B\u2019 in\nFig. 5(b), some energy arrives before the continuous reflection that\ncharacterizes the geometry of the reflecting layer. This energy is\nidentified because it lies above and is not coherent with the reflec-\ntion that is continuous across the section. Near the left-hand end\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 164, 490\u2013500\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nNo claim to original Crown copyright works\n496 R. W. Hobbs, B. J. Drummond and B. R. Goleby\nof the section, interference between the various wavelengths that\ncontribute to the topography of the layer leads to topographic relief\nout of the plane that is steeper than elsewhere. A = 0.22 km, y =\n1.18 km, and z \u2248 9.07 km. In this region, therefore, the right-hand\nside of eq. (4) gives a value of 0.08 km, which is less than A. There-\nfore, at the left-hand end of the section, out-of-plane relief is suf-\nficient to cause out-of-plane reflections to fall above the expected\nposition of the reflector in the section.\nFinally, the reflection that is continuous across the section does\nnot exactly reproduce the geometry of the reflector in the plane of\nthe section. Just below \u2018A\u2019 in Fig. 5(b), the reflection is earlier than\nwould be expected (the dashed line marks the position of the reflector\nin the plane of the section). This is because the seismic section lies\ndiagonally across the side of a steep anticline. The sides of the\nanticlines form the part of the reflector normal to each recording\npoint; the parts of the reflector immediately beneath the recording\npoints are not horizontal and reflect energy out of the plane of the\nsection.\nReflective zone rather than reflective layer\u2014a 2-D case\nModels of shear zones as broad zones in which bands of deformed\nrock wrap around and separate blocks of protolith can be built and\nmodelled in 3-D. The model in Fig. 6(a) was generated using a layer\ndefined by the same method as used for Figs 4 and 5, repeated eight\ntimes with random shifts in X , Y and Z. The maximum peak to trough\ntopography of the layers was scaled variously between 62.5 and\n250 m across the whole model, and the thickness of the layers was\nFigure 6. Reflections from multiple layers in a 2-D shear zone (a) cross-\nsection of the shear zone, (b) stacked data and (c) 2-D migrated data.\nvaried between 10 and 50 m. In three of the layers the topography was\ninverted. This produced a zone of reflectors which had no correlation\nin structure from layer to layer. The layers represented mylonitic\nrocks, and the regions between the layers represented protolith. The\nzone of reflectors represented by Fig. 6(a) is around 250 m thick.\nReal mylonite zones might consist of several such bands that range in\nthickness from a few metres to hundreds of metres across, separated\nby protolith, and with a total width reaching several kilometres (e.g.\nsee the models of Fountain et al. 1984 and Blundell 1990).\nSynthetic seismograms were calculated first for a 2-D slice\nthrough this model in the same way as Fig. 4. The cross-section\nis shown in Fig. 6(a) with the stacked data in Fig. 6(b) and the 2-D\nmigrated data in Fig. 6(c). Reflections from a reference reflector lie\nat the tops of the figures.\nA marked difference between the stacked data for this model and\nthose for a single layer is the number of diffractions, or bow ties.\nWhereas Fig. 4(b) has bow-tie diffractions from the bottoms of each\nof 3 synforms, Fig. 6(b) has many bow-tie diffractions because the\nsynforms in each layer generate diffractions. Several have much\nhigher amplitudes than others, and in places they destructively in-\nterfere. The data migrate to form a band with a clear top and bottom\ndefined by the reflectors that bound the band (Fig. 6c), but the in-\nternal geometry of the reflectors is not discernible in the data at the\nfrequencies and wavelengths used in this modelling.\nReflective zone rather than reflective layer\u2014a 3-D case\nThe synthetics were then recomputed using the full 3-D model.\nStacked data are shown in Fig. 7(a), and migrated data are shown in\nFig. 7(b). The reference reflection is at the top of each section.\nThe stacked data (Fig. 7a) have weaker diffractions compared to\nFigs 4(b), 5(a) and 6(b). This is because many diffractions from\npoint reflectors come into the plane of the section, and because the\nFigure 7.

When the\ndata are migrated (Fig. 7b), the lack of diffracted energy results in\npoor resolution of the bottom of the reflective band, so that, instead\nof being a sharp boundary as in Fig. 6(c), it is more diffuse.\nThree-dimensional reflector with non-homogenous\nbackground velocity modelling\nTo test the sensitivity of the effect with non-homogeneous back-\nground models, two tests were carried out. The first model uses a\nsimple velocity gradient starting at 6.3 km s\u22121 at the surface with a\ngradient of 0.0222 s\u22121, which gives an interval velocity of 6.5 km s\u22121\nat the target depth of 9 km and a migration velocity of 6.4 km s\u22121 at\nthe target time of 2.8 s; the second model introduces a 2 km thick\nbasin filled with 2 km s\u22121 sediments at the surface, the target re-\nFigure 8.

In\nboth cases the impedance of the target is the same as for the pre-\nvious models. The 2-D images of the 3-D surface for both models\nare shown in Figs 8(b) and (c), respectively. Comparisons with the\nequivalent homogeneous model (Fig. 8a), shows that the imaging\nissues are robust despite the variation in overburden velocity model.\nD I S C U S S I O N\nThe initial analysis of the effects of 3-D structure in 2-D seismic\nprofiles presented in this paper is based on the assumption that\nthe Earth can be approximated by an isotropic homogeneous half\nspace above reflectors, as it simplifies both the derivation of eq. (4)\nand the visualization of the region from which reflector topography\nwill cause out-of-plane reflections. Other velocity functions would\nchange the values of out-of-plane offset and topographic relief that\nwould cause the out-of-plane reflection to be recorded before or\nafter the in-plane reflection, however, the principles established for\nthe simple model are still relevant; that is, out-of-plane energy will\nbehave as if it came from within the plane of the section provided\neq. (5) is fulfilled. A qualitative interpretation of the reflections is\nFigs 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 is, therefore, relevant no matter what velocity\nfunction is used. The interpretation is summarized in Table 1.\nIn 2-D, single-layer reflectors produce relatively simple diffrac-\ntion or \u2018bow-tie\u2019 patterns in the stacked sections, with a bow tie\nfor each synform. When 3-D structure is introduced, the number of\ndiffractions or bow ties increases because bow ties are also recorded\nfor the synforms out of the plane of the section. The times at which\nthe out-of-plane bow ties are recorded for a homogeneous model are\ndefined by eq. (4). The migrated data for single-layer reflectors are\ncharacterized by relatively continuous reflections. For 2-D reflec-\ntors, that is, no out-of-plane topography, the reflection response is\na single reflection at the predicted time of the reflector in the plane\nof the section. When 3-D structure is present (Fig. 5), the reflec-\ntion character is still dominated by laterally continuous reflections,\nbut their positions in the seismic section are not accurate predictors\nof the position of the reflector in the plane of the section. Changing\nthe background velocity from a homogeneous to a more complex\nstructure makes little difference to the migrated image as shown in\nFig. 8. eq. (5) predicts the permissible velocity perturbation which\ncan then be used to estimate the swath width that may contain out-\nof-plane reflections that will migrate as if they where in the plane\nof the section. Calculation of this swath-width is complex and is de-\npendent on the details of the velocity model on a case by case basis.\nHowever, eq. (5) implies that for deep seismic imaging or other tar-\ngets where there are only weak velocity variations the swath-width\nwill be large with little discrimination of out-of-plane energy.\nMultiple-layer reflection zones produce many more diffractions,\nor bow ties, than single layer reflectors because a diffraction is cre-\nated for every synform for every layer. They destructively interfere\nat depths below the expected depth of the reflector in the plane of\nthe section (Figs 6b and 7a), and diffractions appear to have lower\namplitudes than those for single layers (Figs 4b and 5a). These ef-\nfects are more marked for 3-D zones (Fig. 7a) than for 2-D reflection\nzones (Fig. 6b). When migrated, the top of the band of reflections\ncan be distinct (Figs 6c and 7b). For 2-D models it predicts the po-\nsition of the top of the reflector zone in the plane of the section,\nbut becomes increasingly unreliable as a predictor as the amount\nof topographic relief increases. The bottom of the reflection zone is\ndistinct for 2-D zones (Fig. 6c), but less so for 3-D zones (Fig. 7b).\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 164, 490\u2013500\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nNo claim to original Crown copyright works\n498 R.

The\nfirst discriminator that could be applied is the length of individual\nreflections: in migrated data, single reflectors will produce reflec-\ntions that are laterally more continuous than multiple layer shear\nzones. An increase in the thickness of the band of more continu-\nous reflections provides an indication of an increasing amount of\nout-of-plane topographic relief on a single reflector. A thick band of\nreflections indicates more relief (in terms of amplitude and number\nof synforms and antiforms) than a thin band of reflections.\nIf the reflections form a band in which individual reflections are\nlaterally short, then the reflections are more likely to come from a\nzone of reflectors rather than a single reflector. In the Earth, such\nfeatures are more likely to be 3-D than 2-D, but as a test a 3-D zone\nwould have a poorly resolved lower boundary compared to a 2-D\nzone.\nHaving used migrated data to discriminate between single layers\nand multiple layers, and 2-D and 3-D topographic relief, the stacked\ndata can be used provide some additional tests. A single 2-D layer\nwill produce a bow tie for each synform evident in the migrated\nsection. If the single layer had 3-D relief, there will more bow-\ntie diffractions than observed synforms and some individual bow-\ntie amplitudes will be high. If the reflections come from a zone\nof reflectors rather than a single reflector, there will be numerous\ndiffractions, but the typical bow-tie form will be less obvious, and\nthe strength of the diffractions will be weak, particularly for 3-D\nmultiple layer zones, because of the destructive interference caused\nby so many diffractions.\nThis summary allows us to examine the reflection character of the\nregional detachment imaged in the Eastern Goldfields Province of\nWestern Australia shown in Fig. 1, and to interpret the likely nature\nof the reflector. Fig. 9 shows distinctly different examples of the\nreflection character of data from two parts of the detachment from\none regional deep seismic profile. In Fig. 9(a), stacked data show\npart of the detachment. Note that the detachment is faulted between\nF and F\u2032. Diffraction D is from a diffractor off the end of the section\nand, therefore, does not migrate properly because the section does\nnot contain all of the diffracted energy. In the migrated data (Fig. 9b),\nthe reflections that define the detachment are long and continuous.\nThe band of reflections is thin (only about 200 ms thick). The top\nof the band of reflections is distinct. The bottom is less distinct, but\nreflections at the bottom appear to be discrete and fully migrated.\nThe reflected energy from the detachment has only a few, strong\ndiffractions. This part of the detachment has the characteristics of a\nsingle reflector with some 3-D out-of-plane topography that cause\na thin band of reflections within the plane of the section.\nThe reflection character of the detachment shown in Figs 9(c)\n(stacked data) and (d) (migrated) is distinctly different from that\nin Figs 9(a) and (b). The stacked data have numerous diffractions,\nmostly dipping to the right. The band of reflections from the detach-\nment is thicker than in Figs 9(a) and (b), and individual reflections\ntend to have less lateral continuity. The top and bottom of the band\nof reflections in the migrated data are more diffuse than in Fig. 9(b);\nthe bottom has the appearance of being slightly undermigrated. The\ndetachment dips to the left in this region, and left-dipping diffrac-\ntions may be coincident with non-diffracted energy. In this region,\nthe reflection character of the detachment is more consistent with a\nbroad zone consisting of a number of reflectors with topography in\nand out of the plane of the section, rather than a single reflector.\nThe common practice in acquiring, processing and interpreting\nregional deep seismic lines is to acknowledge that the Earth is 3-D,\nbut in imaging the Earth using 2-D techniques we have until now not\nhad the mechanism to understand fully the effect of the 3-D struc-\nture in our 2-D sections. In this work, we have been able to describe\nthe effects of energy coming into the plane of the section. We have\nconsidered the effects on the shape of the reflections from single\nreflectors and from shear zones made up of multiple reflectors. This\nwork and the examples of reflection character of the detachment\nfrom the Eastern Goldfields Province of Western Australia suggest\nthat it should be possible to distinguish between 2-D and 3-D shear\nzones, and between shear zones that are single layers and those that\nhave multiple layers.

(A1.3)\nThis equation allows a surface to be built containing a range of wavelengths, with weighting given to each wavelength. The example in Fig. 3\nhas a range of wavelengths from 4200 m down to 420 m, in the X direction, and wavelengths 1.2 times this in the Y direction; that is, the\nlongest wavelength was determined by the topography on the detachment in Fig. 1, and the shortest wavelength was less than the diameter of\nthe first Fresnel zone for reasonable seismic frequencies at the depth of investigation. This produced a surface that was still semi-regular, but\nwith a \u2018roughness\u2019 generated by the inclusion of shorter wavelengths with variable amplitudes and phase shifts. The higher wavelengths were\nattenuated according to equations A1.2 and A1.3 so that the amplitudes of shorter wavelengths did not dominate the surface roughness.\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 164, 490\u2013500\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nNo claim to original Crown copyright works\n"}
