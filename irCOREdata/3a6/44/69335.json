We show that K\u221e and K\u221e control transfer in every fusion system\non a finite p-group when p \u2265 5, and that they control weak closure of elements\nin every fusion system on a finite p-group when p \u2265 3. This generalizes results\nof G. Glauberman concerning finite groups.\n1. Introduction\nLet G be a finite group with Sylow p-subgroup P . The subgroup P \u2229 G\u2032 of P\nis called the focal subgroup of P with respect to G. It is determined locally by the\nfusion of elements in P under conjugation by G; explicitly,\nP \u2229G\u2032 = \u3008x\u22121cg(x) | x \u2208 P and g \u2208 G such that cg(x) \u2208 P \u3009,\nwhere cg : G\u2192 G, x 7\u2192 g\u22121xg. The focal subgroup determines a global property of\nthe group G. Indeed, P \u2229 G\u2032 is a proper subgroup of P if and only if the abelian\nfactor group G\/G\u2032 has a nontrivial p-subgroup, which is equivalent to saying that\nG has a nontrivial p-factor group. Also concerned with phenomena of fusion, an\nelement x \u2208 P is said to be weakly closed in P with respect to H, for some subgroup\nH of G containing P , if for every g \u2208 H such that cg(x) \u2208 P we have cg(x) = x.\nIn [4] (see also [5, \u00a712\u201313]), Glauberman defines for each finite p-group P , char-\nacteristic subgroups K\u221e(P ) and K\u221e(P ) of P , and shows that, denoting K\u221e or K\u221e\nby W,\n(1) when p \u2265 3, W controls weak closure of elements in P with respect to G,\nthat is, if x \u2208 P is weakly closed in P with respect to NG(W(P )), then x\nis weakly closed in P with respect to G;\n(2) when p \u2265 5, W controls p-transfer in G, that is,\nP \u2229G\u2032 = P \u2229 (NG(W(P )))\u2032.\nIn this paper, following the strategy of [8] as in our previous work [3], we generalize\nthese results of Glauberman to arbitrary fusion systems:\nTheorem 1.1. K\u221e and K\u221e control weak closure of elements in every fusion system\non a finite p-group when p \u2265 3.\nTheorem 1.2.

The\nquestion about the control of transfer for p = 3 is still open (cf. [5, Question 16.3]).\nThe above mappings P 7\u2192 K\u221e(P ) and P 7\u2192 K\u221e(P ) are gaining importance\nwithin the fusion system context. For instance, in [8], K\u221e and K\u221e play a central\nrole in showing that any Qd(p)-free fusion system is induced by a finite group.\nMore recently, Robinson [11] uses Theorem 1.2 to obtain results on the number of\nirreducible characters of height zero in a p-block.\nIn \u00a72, we define centers and control of weak closure of elements in fusion systems,\nand prove Theorem 1.1. In \u00a73, we define focal subgroups and control of transfer\nin fusion systems, and state the main technical theorem (Theorem 3.1) from which\nTheorem 1.2 follows as a corollary. In \u00a74, we consider the transfer map in fusion\nsystems, and use it to prove some lemmas concerning focal subgroups. In \u00a75, we\nprove Theorem 3.1. In \u00a76, we generalize additional results on control of transfer\nand weak closure from [5] to fusion systems. We end this article with a recap in\n\u00a77 on Glauberman\u2019s K\u221e and K\u221e constructions. Our general terminology follows\n[8] and [3]; in particular, by a fusion system we always mean a saturated fusion\nsystem.\n2. Control of Weak Closure in Fusion Systems\nLet F be a fusion system on a finite p-group P . The center Z(F) of F is the\nlargest subgroup Q of P such that every morphism in F can be extended to a\nmorphism in F which is the identity map on Q. One can easily show that Z(F)\nis the set of all weakly closed elements in P with respect to F , i.e. elements x \u2208 P\nsuch that \u03d5(x) = x for all \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (\u3008x\u3009, P ).\nFollowing [8], a positive characteristic p-functor is a map W sending every finite\np-group Q to a characteristic subgroup W(Q) of Q such that\n(1) W(Q) 6= 1 if Q 6= 1;\n(2) if \u03d5 : Q\u2192 R is an isomorphism of finite p-groups, then \u03d5(W(Q)) = W(R).\nThe assumption that W(Q) is characteristic in Q is redundant as this property\nfollows from (2). Also, the term functor is slightly misleading as W is only a functor\non the category of p-groups with isomorphisms as morphisms.\nFor a subgroup Q of P , set W1(Q) = Q and for any positive integer i, define\nWi+1(Q) = W(NP (Wi(Q))). We say that Q is (F ,W)-well-placed if Wi(Q) is\nfully F-normalized for all positive integers i. Note that Wi(Q) = W(P ) for all\nsufficiently large i and that, if Q is (F ,W)-well-placed, so is Wi(Q) for every i.\nFurthermore, by [3, 2.12], the set of (F ,W)-well-placed subgroups of P forms a\nconjugation family. Thus, Alperin\u2019s fusion theorem implies that every morphism\nin F is a composition of a finite number of restrictions of F-automorphisms of\n(F ,W)-well-placed subgroups of P .\nSuppose further that Z(Q) \u2264 W(Q) for every finite p-group Q. We say that W\ncontrols weak closure of elements in F if\nZ(NF (W(P ))) = Z(F).\nThe following proposition shows that control of weak closure in fusion systems\nis locally determined.\nProposition 2.1. Let F be a fusion system on a finite p-group P , and let W be\na positive characteristic p-functor such that Z(Q) \u2264W(Q) for every finite p-group\nCONTROL OF TRANSFER AND WEAK CLOSURE IN FUSION SYSTEMS 3\nQ. If there exists x \u2208 Z(NF (W(P ))) such that x \/\u2208 Z(F), then there exists an\n(F ,W)-well-placed subgroup T of P containing x such that x \u2208 Z(NF (W(NP (T ))))\nand x \/\u2208 Z(NF (T )).\nProof. We have Z(NF (W(P ))) \u2264 Z(P ), since W(P ) is normal in P ; in particular\nx \u2208 Z(P ). By Alperin\u2019s fusion theorem, there is an (F ,W)-well-placed subgroup\nT of P containing x and a morphism \u03d5 \u2208 AutF (T ) such that \u03d5(x) 6= x, i.e.\nx \/\u2208 Z(NF (T )). Amongst all such T , choose one with |NP (T )| maximal. Note\nthat\nx \u2208 T \u2229 Z(P ) \u2264 NP (T ) \u2229 Z(P ) \u2264 Z(NP (T )) \u2264W(NP (T )).\nSuppose that x \/\u2208 Z(NF (W(NP (T )))). We have\n|NP (T )| \u2265 |NP (W(NP (T )))| \u2265 |NP (NP (T ))|,\nwhere the first inequality follows from the maximality of |NP (T )|. Hence, T is\nnormal in P and x \/\u2208 Z(NF (W(NP (T )))) = Z(NF (W(P ))), a contradiction. This\nshows that x \u2208 Z(NF (W(NP (T )))). \u0003\nConsider now the positive characteristic p-functors W such that Z(Q) \u2264W(Q),\nfor every finite p-group Q. We say that W satisfies condition (C) if\n(C) Op(G) \u2229 Z(G) = Op(G) \u2229 Z(NG(W(P ))),\nwhenever G is a finite group with Sylow p-subgroup P . Observe that this condition\nonly depends on the subgroup structure in finite groups, and it is sufficient for the\nproof of the next result.\nTheorem 2.2. Let W be a positive characteristic p-functor such that Z(Q) \u2264W(Q)\nfor every finite p-group Q. If W satisfies condition (C), then W controls weak\nclosure of elements in every fusion system F on a finite p-group P .\nProof. Suppose that the theorem is false and take a counterexample F with minimal\nnumber |F| of morphisms. Accordingly, there is an element x \u2208 Z(NF (W(P ))) with\nx \/\u2208 Z(F). By Proposition 2.1, there is an (F ,W)-well-placed subgroup T of P\ncontaining x such that x \u2208 Z(NF (W(NP (T )))) and x \/\u2208 Z(NF (T )). If NF (T ) < F ,\nthen by the minimality of |F|, we have\nZ(NF (W(NP (T )))) \u2264 Z(NNF (T )(W(NP (T )))) = Z(NF (T )),\ncontradicting the choice of x. Thus, 1 6= T \u2264 Op(F).\nSet Q = Op(F) and R = QCP (Q). We show that Q = R and hence that Q is\nF-centric. Suppose that Q < R and so NF (R) < F . By the minimality of |F|, we\nhave\nx \u2208 Z(NF (W(P ))) \u2264 Z(NNF (R)(W(P ))) = Z(NF (R)).\nAs x \u2208 Q and every F-automorphism of Q extends to an F-automorphism of R\n(by the extension axiom) this contradicts the assumption that x \/\u2208 Z(F). Therefore\nQ = R = Op(F) is F-centric.\nBy [1, 4.3], there exists a finite group G such that F = FP (G) and such that\nOp(G) = Op(F). By condition (C), we have\nx \u2208 Op(G) \u2229 Z(NG(W(P ))) = Op(F) \u2229 Z(F)\nand so x \u2208 Z(F), a contradiction. \u0003\n4 ANTONIO DI\u00b4AZ\u2020, ADAM GLESSER, NADIA MAZZA, AND SEJONG PARK\nWe now show that the positive characteristic p-functors K\u221e and K\u221e control\nweak closure of elements in any fusion system. We refer the reader to Section 7\nfor the background material. Let us also recall the following standard commutator\nnotation. If H is a subgroup of a group G and g \u2208 G, define [H, g; 0] = H and\n[H, g; i+ 1] = [[H, g; i], g], for i \u2265 0.\nProof of Theorem 1.1. Let W denote K\u221e or K\u221e. By Lemma 7.2, Z(Q) \u2264 W (Q)\nfor every finite p-group Q. Hence, by Theorem 2.2, it will suffice to show that W\nsatisfies condition (C) when p \u2265 3. Suppose that G is a finite group, P is a Sylow\np-subgroup of G. We assume that W(P ) 5 G. Set Z = Z(Op(G)). Let E0 be the\nset of all elements g \u2208 P such that [X, g; p \u2212 1] \u2264 Y for every chief factor X\/Y of\nG with X \u2264 Z. Set E = \u3008E0\u3009 and L = NG(E). By Theorem 7.3, E0 is nonempty,\nand, by Theorem 7.4, we have P \u2264 L < G and Z \u2229 Z(G) = Z \u2229 Z(L). Clearly\nOp(G) \u2264 P \u2264 L, so we have Op(G) \u2229 Z(G) = Op(G) \u2229 Z(L). By induction on the\norder of G, we have Op(L)\u2229Z(L) = Op(L)\u2229Z(NL(W(P ))). Intersecting both sides\nwith Op(G), we get\nOp(G) \u2229 Z(L) = Op(G) \u2229 Z(NL(W(P ))) \u2265 Op(G) \u2229 Z(NG(W(P ))).\nThus, Op(G)\u2229Z(G) \u2265 Op(G)\u2229Z(NG(W(P ))). The reverse inclusion is trivial. \u0003\n3. Focal Subgroups and Control of Transfer in Fusion Systems\nLet F be a fusion system on a finite p-group P . For Q \u2264 P , define\n[Q,F ] = \u3008u\u22121\u03d5(u) | u \u2208 Q, \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (\u3008u\u3009, P )\u3009.\nand call [P,F ] the F-focal subgroup of P . Note that if F = FP (G) is the fusion\nsystem on P defined by the inclusion of P as a Sylow p-subgroup of some finite\ngroup G, then the focal subgroup theorem reads ([7, Theorem 7.3.4]),\nP \u2229G\u2032 = [P,F ].\nGiven subgroups Q and R of P with Q \u2264 R, we say that Q is weakly F-closed\nin R if \u03d5(Q) = Q for all \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (Q,R). In particular, if Q is weakly F-closed\nin P , then Q E P . For short, and if there is no possible confusion, we simply\nsay that a subgroup Q is weakly F-closed, instead of weakly F-closed in P . It is\nstraightforward to show that [P,F ] is weakly F-closed.\nA positive characteristic p-functor W controls transfer in F if the F-focal sub-\ngroup equals the NF (W(P ))-focal subgroup, i.e., if\n[P,F ] = [P,NF (W(P ))].\nAs for condition (C) in the previous section, we appeal now to a concept which\ndepends only on the subgroup structure in finite groups. Namely, we say that W\nsatisfies condition (T) if\n(T) CG(Op(G)) \u2264 Op(G) implies Op(G) \u2229G\u2032 = Op(G) \u2229 (NG(W(P )))\u2032,\nwhenever G is a finite group with Sylow p-subgroup P .\nTheorem 3.1. If W is a positive characteristic p-functor satisfying condition (T),\nthen W controls transfer in every fusion system F on a finite p-group P .\nWe prove this theorem in \u00a75 and get Theorem 1.2 as a corollary.\nCONTROL OF TRANSFER AND WEAK CLOSURE IN FUSION SYSTEMS 5\nProof of Theorem 1.2. Let W denote K\u221e or K\u221e. By Theorem 3.1, it will suffice\nto show that W satisfies condition (T) when p \u2265 5. Suppose that G is a finite\ngroup, P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, and CG(Op(G)) \u2264 Op(G). Let Q = Op(G).\nWe assume that W(P ) 5 G. Let E0 be the set of all elements g \u2208 P such that\n[X, g; p \u2212 1] \u2264 Y for every chief factor X\/Y of G with X \u2264 Q. Set E = \u3008E0\u3009\nand L = NG(E). By Theorem 7.3, E0 is nonempty, and, by Theorem 7.4, we have\nP \u2264 L < G and Q\u2229G\u2032 = Q\u2229L\u2032. Clearly Q \u2264 P \u2264 L, and so Q \u2264 Op(L); therefore,\nCL(Op(L)) \u2264 Op(L). By induction on the order of G, we have\nQ \u2229 L\u2032 = Q \u2229 (Op(L) \u2229 L\u2032) = Q \u2229 (Op(L) \u2229NL(W(P ))\u2032) \u2264 Q \u2229NG(W(P ))\u2032.\nThus, Q\u2229G\u2032 \u2264 Q\u2229NG(W(P ))\u2032. Since the opposite containment holds trivially, we\nget Q \u2229G\u2032 = Q \u2229NG(W(P ))\u2032. \u0003\n4. The Transfer Map in Fusion Systems\nFor a group P , a subgroup Q of P , and a group homomorphism \u03d5 : Q\u2192 P , let\nP \u00d7(Q,\u03d5) P = P \u00d7 P\/ \u223c\nwhere (x, uy) \u223c (x\u03d5(u), y) for x, y \u2208 P , u \u2208 Q, viewed as a P -P -biset via\nt \u00b7 (x, y) = (tx, y) and (x, y) \u00b7 t = (x, yt) for x, y, t \u2208 P .\nThe next theorem plays a crucial role in the theory of fusion systems.\nTheorem 4.1 ([2, 5.5]). Let F be a fusion system on a finite p-group P . There is\na finite P -P -biset X with the following properties:\n(1) Every transitive subbiset of X is isomorphic to P\u00d7(Q,\u03d5)P for some subgroup\nQ of P and some group homomorphism \u03d5 : Q\u2192 P belonging to F .\n(2) For any Q \u2264 P and any \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (Q,P ), the Q-P -bisets QX and \u03d5X are\nisomorphic.\n(3) |X|\/|P | \u2261 1 (mod p).\nLet F be a fusion system on a finite p-group P . We call a P -P -biset X satisfying\nthe properties of Theorem 4.1 a P -P -biset associated with F . In the case that\nF = FP (G) is the fusion system defined by a finite group G, there is a suitable\nnon-negative integer k such that the P -P -biset X =\n\u2210k\nG is associated with F .\nThe integer k is chosen so that |X|\/|P | \u2261 1 (mod p), the two other conditions of\nTheorem 4.1 being satisfied by any finite number of copies of the P -P -biset G. We\nrefer the reader to [2, \u00a75] for further details.\nNow, suppose that X =\n\u2294\ni P \u00d7(Qi,\u03d5i) P , and let A be an abelian group with\ntrivial P -action. The transfer map associated with X is the group homomorphism\ntX : H\u2217(P,A)\u2192 H\u2217(P,A)\ndefined by\ntX =\n\u2211\ni\ntPQi \u25e6 res\u03d5i ,\nwhere, for a subgroup Q of P , the map tPQ : H\n\u2217(Q,A)\u2192 H\u2217(P,A) is the transfer. In\nparticular, identifying H1(Q,A) with the set of group homomorphisms Hom(Q,A),\nTheorem VII.3.2 in [7] yields\ntPQ(\u03b1)(x) =\n\u2211\nt\u2208T\n\u03b1\n(\n(x \u00b7 t)\u22121xt) , for all x \u2208 P and for all \u03b1 \u2208 H1(Q,A),\n6 ANTONIO DI\u00b4AZ\u2020, ADAM GLESSER, NADIA MAZZA, AND SEJONG PARK\nwhere T is a set of left coset representatives of Q in P , and where the \u00b7 symbol\ndenotes the action of P on T induced by the permutation of the cosets. Thus,\nx \u00b7 t \u2208 T and (x \u00b7 t)\u22121xt \u2208 Q.\nBy [2], we have\nIm tX = H\u2217(P,A)F \u223c= lim\u2190\u2212F\nH\u2217(\u2212, A),\nwhere H\u2217(P,A)F denotes the set of elements \u03b1 \u2208 H\u2217(P,A) such that resPQ(\u03b1) =\nres\u03d5(\u03b1) for every Q \u2264 P and every \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (Q,P ). In particular, if F = FP (G)\nfor some finite group G with Sylow p-subgroup P , we have that Im tX = H\u2217(P,A)G\nis the set of G-stable elements in H\u2217(P,A).\nThe following three lemmas generalize results in [5] to arbitrary fusion systems\nusing the transfer map.\nLemma 4.2 ([5, 4.2]). Let F be a fusion system on a finite p-group P and let X\nbe a finite P -P -biset associated with F . Set \u03c4 = tX(pi), where pi : P \u2192 P\/P \u2032 is the\ncanonical surjection, and let n = |X|\/|P |. If u \u2208 Z(F), then \u03c4(u) = unP \u2032.\nProof. Let X =\n\u2294\ni P \u00d7(Qi,\u03d5i) P . Note that |X|\/|P | =\n\u2211\ni |P : Qi|. If u \u2208 Z(F),\nthen \u2014 switching to multiplicative notation \u2014\n\u03c4(u) =\n\u220f\ni\n((tPQi \u25e6 res\u03d5i)(pi))(u)\n=\n\u220f\ni\ntPQi(pi \u25e6 \u03d5i)(u)\n=\n\u220f\ni\n\u220f\nt\u2208Ti\n(pi \u25e6 \u03d5i)((u \u00b7 t)\u22121ut)\nwhere Ti is a set of left coset representatives for Qi in P . Decompose each Ti into\n\u3008u\u3009-orbits and choose one element tij from each orbit. Let rij be the length of the\n\u3008u\u3009-orbit containing tij . We then obtain |P : Qi| =\n\u2211\nj\nrij and since urij \u00b7 tij = tij\nfor all i and j, we get\n\u03c4(u) =\n\u220f\ni\n\u220f\nj\nrij\u22121\u220f\nk=0\n(pi \u25e6 \u03d5i)((uk+1 \u00b7 tij)\u22121u(uk \u00b7 tij))\n=\n\u220f\ni\n\u220f\nj\n(pi \u25e6 \u03d5i)(\nrij\u22121\u220f\nk=0\n(uk+1 \u00b7 tij)\u22121u(uk \u00b7 tij))\n=\n\u220f\ni\n\u220f\nj\n(pi \u25e6 \u03d5i)(t\u22121ij urij tij)\n=\n\u220f\ni\n\u220f\nj\npi(urij )\n=\n\u220f\ni\npi(u|P :Qi|)\n= pi(un) = unP \u2032\nbecause u \u2208 Z(F). \u0003\nLemma 4.3 ([5, 4.4]). Let F be a fusion system on a finite p-group P . Then\n[P,F ] \u2229 Z(F) = P \u2032 \u2229 Z(F).\nCONTROL OF TRANSFER AND WEAK CLOSURE IN FUSION SYSTEMS 7\nProof. Clearly P \u2032 \u2229 Z(F) \u2264 [P,F ] \u2229 Z(F). Conversely, suppose that z \u2208 [P,F ] \u2229\nZ(F). Let \u03c4 be defined as in Lemma 4.2. By Theorem 4.1, for every subgroup Q\nof P and every morphism \u03d5 : Q \u2192 P in F , we have resPQ(\u03c4) = res\u03d5(\u03c4), that is,\n\u03c4(u) = \u03c4(\u03d5(u)) for every u \u2208 Q. Thus, \u03c4(z) = P \u2032 as z \u2208 [P,F ]. On the other\nhand, \u03c4(z) = znP \u2032 by Lemma 4.2. Thus, zn \u2208 P \u2032. Since n is prime to p and z is a\np-element, it follows that z \u2208 P \u2032. \u0003\nLemma 4.4 ([5, 6.7]). Let F be a fusion system on a finite p-group P and let G be\na fusion subsystem of F on P . Suppose that Q is a subgroup of P which is normal\nin F . If [Q,F ] = [Q,G], then [P,F ] \u2229Q = [P,G] \u2229Q.\nProof. Let R = [P,F ] \u2229 Q, S = [Q,F ] = [Q,G]. It will suffice to show that\nR \u2264 [P,G]. Clearly, S \u2264 R, and since Q C F and S is weakly F-closed, we have\nS C F . Furthermore, R\/S \u2264 Z(F\/S), where the quotient fusion system is defined\nas in [9, 6.2]. In fact, if x \u2208 R and \u03d5 \u2208 HomF\/S(\u3008xS\u3009, P\/S), then x\u22121\u03d5(x) \u2208 S for\nany \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (\u3008x\u3009, P ) inducing \u03d5. This implies that \u03d5(xS) = \u03d5(x)S = xS and so\nxS \u2208 Z(R\/S). By Lemma 4.3, R\/S \u2264 [P\/S,F\/S] \u2229 Z(F\/S) = (P\/S)\u2032 \u2229 Z(F\/S).\nThus, R \u2264 P \u2032S = P \u2032[Q,G] \u2264 [P,G]. \u0003\n5. Proof of Theorem 3.1\nTo prove Theorem 3.1, we need the following two lemmas. The first shows that\ncontrol of transfer in fusion systems is locally determined.\nLemma 5.1. Let F be a fusion system on a finite p-group P and let W be a posi-\ntive characteristic p-functor. If W controls transfer in NF (Q) for every nontrivial\n(F ,W)-well-placed subgroup Q of P , then W controls transfer in F .\nProof. For every nontrivial (F ,W)-well-placed subgroup Q of P we have\n[NP (Q),NF (Q)] = [NP (Q),NNF (Q)(W(NP (Q)))]\n\u2264 [NP (W(NP (Q))),NF (W(NP (Q)))]\nbecause W(NP (Q)) E NP (Q). Since Wi(Q) is (F ,W)-well-placed for all i and\nWi(Q) = W(P ) for all sufficiently large i, we can repeat the above argument until\nwe get\n[NP (Q),NF (Q)] \u2264 [P,NF (W(P ))].\nThe lemma now follows from Alperin\u2019s fusion theorem. \u0003\nThe following result is [10, Lemma 3.7], and we include a proof for the conve-\nnience of the reader. It considerably shortens Kessar and Linckelmann\u2019s proofs of\n[8, Theorems A and B] (see also [6]).\nLemma 5.2. Let F be a fusion system on a finite p-group P . If Q C F , then\nF = \u3008PCF (Q),NF (QCP (Q))\u3009\nwhere \u3008PCF (Q),NF (QCP (Q))\u3009 denotes the subcategory of F on P generated by\nPCF (Q) and NF (QCP (Q)).\nProof. Let U be a fully F-normalized centric radical subgroup of P , and take \u03d5 \u2208\nAutF (U). Note that Q \u2264 U by [1, 1.6]. Since Q C F , we have \u03b8 = \u03d5|Q \u2208 AutF (Q).\nAs UQCP (Q) \u2264 N\u03b8, there is \u03c8 \u2208 HomF (UQCP (Q), P ) such that \u03c8|Q = \u03d5|Q. Then\n\u03d5 = (\u03d5 \u25e6 (\u03c8|U )\u22121) \u25e6 \u03c8|U .\n8 ANTONIO DI\u00b4AZ\u2020, ADAM GLESSER, NADIA MAZZA, AND SEJONG PARK\nNow, \u03d5\u25e6(\u03c8|U )\u22121 is a morphism in PCF (Q) and \u03c8|U is a morphism in NF (QCP (Q))\nbecause \u03c8(QCP (Q)) = QCP (Q). Consequently, we have that \u03d5 is a morphism\nin \u3008PCF (Q),NF (QCP (Q))\u3009. By Alperin\u2019s fusion theorem, it follows that F =\n\u3008PCF (Q),NF (QCP (Q))\u3009. \u0003\nNow we prove Theorem 3.1. The proof follows exactly the line of arguments in\nthe proof of [8, Theorem B]. It also incorporates arguments in [5, 6.8], generalized\nto arbitrary fusion systems, if needed, as in Lemma 4.4.\nProof of Theorem 3.1. Suppose that the theorem is false and take a counterexample\nF with a minimal number |F| of morphisms.\n\u2022 Op(F) 6= 1: Set Q = Op(F). If Q = 1, then for any nontrivial (F ,W)-well-\nplaced subgroup T of P , we have NF (T ) < F . By the minimality of |F|, it follows\nthat W controls transfer in NF (T ). Now, Lemma 5.1 implies that W controls\ntransfer in F , a contradiction.\n\u2022 QCP (Q) > Q: Set R = QCP (Q). If R = Q, then by [1, 4.3], there exists a\nfinite group G such that F = FP (G) and CG(Q) \u2264 Q; in particular, Op(G) = Q.\nBy condition (T), we have\n(\u2217) Q \u2229G\u2032 = Q \u2229NG(W(P ))\u2032.\nFor every subgroup H of G, let H = HQ\/Q. Since |FP (G)| < |F|, we have\n[P ,FP (G)] = [P ,NFP (G)(W(P ))], i.e., P \u2229 G\n\u2032\n= P \u2229 NG(W(P ))\u2032. If L is the\nsubgroup of G containing Q such that L = NG(W(P )), then P \u2229G\n\u2032\n= P \u2229 L\u2032 and\nso P \u2229G\u2032 \u2264 L\u2032Q. This gives\nP \u2229G\u2032 \u2264 P \u2229 L\u2032Q = (P \u2229 L\u2032)Q\nby Dedekind\u2019s lemma (see [5, 6.2]). Letting T1 = P \u2229G\u2032, T2 = P \u2229 L\u2032, we obtain,\nagain by Dedekind\u2019s lemma,\nP \u2229G\u2032 = QT2 \u2229 T1 = (Q \u2229 T1)T2 = (Q \u2229G\u2032)(P \u2229 L\u2032).\nHence, the containment NG(W(P )) \u2264 L implies\nP \u2229G\u2032 = (Q \u2229 L\u2032)(P \u2229 L\u2032) = P \u2229 L\u2032.\nSince W(P ) is characterisitic in P , we have P \u2264 L. As Op(G) = 1, we have L < G,\nwhence P \u2264 L < G. Clearly Q E L and CL(Q) \u2264 CG(Q) \u2264 Q. By the uniqueness\nof G, it follows that FP (L) < F . Thus, the minimality of |F| and the focal subgroup\ntheorem imply\nP \u2229 L\u2032 = [P,FP (L)] = [P,NFP (L)(W(P ))] \u2264 [P,NF (W(P ))].\nTherefore, [P,F ] = P \u2229G\u2032 = P \u2229 L\u2032 = [P,NF (W(P ))], a contradiction.\n\u2022 F = PCF (Q): Suppose that PCF (Q) 6= F . By the minimality of |F|, W\ncontrols transfer in PCF (Q). On the other hand, NF (R) 6= F because R > Q =\nOp(F), and hence W also controls transfer in NF (R). By Lemma 5.2, it follows\nthat W controls transfer in F , a contradiction. Thus, we have F = PCF (Q).\n\u2022 Now let V be the inverse image of W(P\/Q) in P under the canonical surjection.\nBy [8, 3.4], we have NF (V )\/Q = NF\/Q(W(P\/Q)). By the minimality of |F|, we\nhave [P\/Q,F\/Q] = [P\/Q,NF (V )\/Q], and so\n[P,F ]\/([P,F ] \u2229Q) = [P,NF (V )]\/([P,NF (V )] \u2229Q).\nCONTROL OF TRANSFER AND WEAK CLOSURE IN FUSION SYSTEMS 9\nSince F = PCF (Q) and V E P , we have [Q,F ] = [Q,P ] = [Q,NF (V )]. By\nLemma 4.4, we have [P,F ] \u2229Q = [P,NF (V )] \u2229Q. Thus, [P,F ] = [P,NF (V )].\nSince W(P\/Q) 6= 1, we have Q < V and so NF (V ) < F . By the minimality of\n|F|, it follows that [P,NF (V )] = [P,NNF (V )(W(P ))] \u2264 [P,NF (W(P ))]. This shows\nthat [P,F ] = [P,NF (W(P ))], a contradiction. \u0003\n6. Additional Results\nIn this section, we prove some additional results on control of transfer and weak\nclosure that generalize the statements [5, 6.3, 12.5 and 12.8]:\nProposition 6.1 ([5, 6.9]). Suppose that F is a fusion system on a nontrival finite\np-group P such that AutF (P ) is a p-group (or, equivalently, NF (P ) = FP (P )). If\nthere exists a positive characteristic p-functor that controls transfer in F and every\nquotient of F , then [P,F ] < P .\nProof. Suppose that the proposition is false and take a counterexample F with\na minimal number |F| of morphisms. If W is a positive characteristic p-functor\nthat controls transfer in F , then [P,F ] = [P,NF (W(P ))] and so we must have\nW(P ) C F . Set Z = Z(W(P )), P = P\/Z, and F = F\/Z, where the quotient fusion\nsystem is defined as in [9, 6.2]. If Z < P , then P 6= 1, |F| < |F|, and AutF (P ) is a\np-group because it is a homomorphic image of AutF (P ). By the minimality of |F|,\nwe have [P,F ] = [P ,F ] < P , contradicting [P,F ] = P . So Z = P and hence P is\nabelian. By Burnside\u2019s theorem (see [9, Theorem 3.8]), F = NF (P ) = FP (P ) and\nso 1 = [P, P ] = [P,F ] = P 6= 1, a contradiction. \u0003\nCorollary 6.2 is now a consequence of Theorem 1.2 and the preceeding proposi-\ntion.\nCorollary 6.2 ([5, 12.5]). Let p \u2265 5. If F is a fusion system on a nontrivial finite\np-group P such that AutF (P ) is a p-group, then [P,F ] < P .\nProposition 6.3 ([5, 7.9]). Let W be a positive characteristic p-functor such that\nZ(Q) \u2264 W(Q) for every finite p-group Q. Suppose that, whenever G is a finite\ngroup with Sylow p-subgroup P such that W(P ) 6 G, there is g \u2208 P \u2212Op(G) such\nthat [Z(Op(G)), g, g] = 1. If F is a fusion system on a finite p-group P , then\nZ(P )p \u2229 Z(NF (W(P ))) \u2264 Z(F).\nProof. Suppose the proposition is false and take a counterexample F with a minimal\nnumber |F| of morphisms. This gives an element x \u2208 Z(P )p \u2229 Z(NF (W(P ))) such\nthat x \/\u2208 Z(F). By Proposition 2.1, there is an (F ,W)-well-placed subgroup T of P\ncontaining x such that x \u2208 Z(NF (W(NP (T )))) and x \/\u2208 Z(NF (T )). As x \u2208 Z(P )p \u2264\nZ(NP (T ))p, the minimality of F implies F = NF (T ); in particular, x \u2208 T \u2264 Op(F).\nLet Q = Op(F). By Lemma 5.2, we have F = \u3008PCF (Q),NF (QCP (Q))\u3009. Since\nx \u2208 Q \u2229 Z(P ), we have x \u2208 Z(PCF (Q)) and hence x \/\u2208 Z(NF (CP (Q))). On the\nother hand,\nx \u2208 Z(P )p \u2229 Z(NNF (CP (Q))(W(P )))\nand so by the minimality of F , we have F = NF (QCP (Q)). Therefore, Q =\nQCP (Q) is F-centric and hence F is constrained. By [1, 4.3], there exists a finite\ngroup G with Sylow p-subgroup P such that F = FP (G) and the result now follows\nfrom [5, Theorem 7.9]. \u0003\n10 ANTONIO DI\u00b4AZ\u2020, ADAM GLESSER, NADIA MAZZA, AND SEJONG PARK\nAs a special case of Proposition 6.3 we get (utilizing [5, 12.3]) the following\ncorollary.\nCorollary 6.4 ([5, 12.8]). Let W denote either K\u221e or K\u221e. If F is a fusion system\non a finite p-group P , then Z(P )p \u2229 Z(NF (W(P ))) \u2264 Z(F).\n7. Appendix : K\u221e and K\u221e\nFor the sake of completeness, we summarize the definitions and properties of the\npositive characteristic p-functors K\u221e and K\u221e, as introduced in [5, \u00a7 12 and 13].\nLet P be a finite p-group and let Q \u2264 P . Define M(P ;Q) to be the set of\nsubgroups B of P normalized by Q and such that B\/Z(B) is abelian. We identify\ntwo useful subsets. First, M\u2217(P ;Q) will denote the subset of M(P ;Q) containing\nthose subgroups B for which the conjugation action of Q on B induces the trivial\naction on B\/Z(B). The second subset, M\u2217(P ;Q), is slightly more complicated.\nFor this subset, we choose those subgroups B of M(P ;Q) satisfying the following\ncondition: if A \u2208 M(P ;B) such that A \u2264 Q \u2229 CP ([Z(B), A]) and A\u2032 \u2264 CP (B),\nthen the conjugation action of A on B induces the trivial action on B\/Z(B).\nSet K\u22121(P ) = P , and for i \u2265 0, define inductively\nKi(P ) =\n{\n\u3008M\u2217(P ; Ki\u22121(P )\u3009 for i odd\n\u3008M\u2217(P ; Ki\u22121(P )\u3009 for i even.\nDefinition 7.1. Let P be a finite p-group. We set\nK\u221e(P ) =\n\u22c2\ni \u2265 \u22121, odd\nKi(P )\nK\u221e(P ) = \u3008Ki(P ) | i \u2265 0, even\u3009.\nHere are the main properties of K\u221e(P ) and K\u221e(P ).\nLemma 7.2.

In particular, if P 6= 1, then W(P ) 6= 1.\n(3) If \u03d5 : P \u2192 Q is a group isomorphism, then \u03d5(W(P )) = W(Q).\nConsequently, the mappings P 7\u2192 K\u221e(P ) and P 7\u2192 K\u221e(P ) are positive character-\nistic p-functors.\nThe next theorem is the key result \u2014 for our purposes \u2014 of Glauberman on the\nK-infinity subgroups.\nTheorem 7.3. [5, 12.3] Let G be a finite group with Sylow p-subgroup P and set\nT = Op(G). If K\u221e(P ) or K\u221e(P ) is not normal in G, then there exists g \u2208 P , with\ng \/\u2208 Op(G) such that:\n(1) [X, g; 4] \u2264 Y for every chief factor X\/Y of G such that X \u2264 T ;\n(2) [Z(T ), g, g] = 1.\nWe also need the following result.\nTheorem 7.4.
