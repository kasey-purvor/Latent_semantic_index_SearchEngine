The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between leadership-\nrelevant attributes and occupational self-efficacy in management students. We assumed \nthat leadership-relevant attributes are related to high self-efficacy beliefs. \nDesign\/methodology\/approach. In the present study management students from three \ndifferent countries, namely Germany, Australia, and India, described to what degree \nthey possess task- and person- oriented leadership attributes and indicated their \noccupational self-efficacy for their future profession. Data were analysed using \nregression analyses.  \nFindings. As expected, leadership-relevant attributes were related to occupational self-\nefficacy. Some support was found for the assumption that ratings of the importance of -\nrelevant attributes moderates the relationship between reported leadership-relevant \nattributes and occupational self-efficacy but only for task-oriented attributes. \nResearch limitations\/implications. The sample size was small so that comparisons \nbetween subgroups were not possible. All data were self-reported. \nPractical implications. The results are relevant for career counselling. Looking at self-\ndescription of individuals in terms of attributes relevant to their future job rather than \nworking directly on their occupational self-efficacy could be emphasised. \nOriginality\/value. The study provides initial hints at the relationship between self-\ndescription and occupational self-efficacy in connection with future managers. \n \nKeywords: Occupational self-efficacy, Leadership attributes, Agency, \nCommunion \n \nOccupational Self-Efficacy 3 \n \nLeadership Attributes Valence in Self-Concept and Occupational Self-efficacy \nThe concept of self-efficacy was introduced by Bandura in the 1970s and defined as the \n\u201cconviction that one can successfully execute the behaviour required to produce certain \noutcomes\u201d (Bandura, 1977a, p. 193). Self-efficacy is associated with various favourable \nconsequences, particularly on physical and mental health, and congruent with the \nemphasis of mastery, self-reliance, and achievement in Western cultures (Gecas, 1989). \nSelf-efficacy is developed via several mechanisms; the most important ones are mastery \nexperience and model learning (Bandura, 1977).  \nSelf efficacy has been assessed on different levels of specificity. Originally defined \nas task-specific (e.g., Bandura, 1977), it has often been conceptualised as domain-\nspecific (e.g., research self-efficacy: Forester, Kahn & Hesson-McInnis, 2004) or \ngeneral (Sherer et al., 1982; Chen, Gully & Eden, 2001). In terms of the relationship \nbetween self-efficacy and outcomes, the level of specificity of the assessment of self- \nefficacy should depend on the level of specificity of the outcome to be predicted (lens \nmodel, see Brunswick, 1955; for a review of this problem with respect to self-efficacy \nsee Gist & Mitchell, 1992). For example, if one wants to predict the performance in a \nspecific task, the level of self-efficacy that needs to be assessed is task specific. If one \nwants to predict the performance in an occupation (as is the case in our study), level of \nself-efficacy assessed needs to be broader, that is, domain- rather than task-specific. A \nrecent study by Salanova, Pe\u00edro and Schaufeli (2002) showed the value of \ndifferentiating between domain- versus general self-efficacy in the case of burnout, \nindicating that a general assessment of self-efficacy is not specific enough even when \npredicting relatively broad concepts such as burnout.  \nOccupational Self-Efficacy 4 \n \nAlthough the concept of self-efficacy originates in clinical psychology, it has been \nwidely applied in the organisational context (e.g., Abele & Spurk, 2009; Berings, Poell, \nSimons & van Veldhoven, 2007; Garofano & Salas, 2005; Judge & Bono, 2001). Self-\nefficacy has been shown to play a central role with respect to organisational \nperformance (e.g., meta-analysis by Staijkovic & Luthans, 1998), persistence in a task \n(e.g., Multon, Brown, & Lent, 1991), as well as the approach of new and challenging \ntasks (e.g., Sexton & Tuckman, 1991). This shows that self-efficacy can be regarded as \nresource in organisations. In our study, we are interested to explore self-efficacy during \neducation and thus prior to entering the labour market. The concept in the focus of our \nstudy is occupational self-efficacy as introduced by Schyns and von Collani (2002). It \ndescribes a domain-specific assessment of self-efficacy in the occupational area. We \nwill briefly outline prior research using this concept before going into detail of the \nrelationship between leadership and self-efficacy. \nOccupational self-efficacy \nOccupational self-efficacy reflects the conviction of a person that he\/she can execute \nbehaviours relevant to their own work. Following Schyns and von Collani (2002) \noccupational self-efficacy is relatively stable due to its correlations to personality \ncharacteristics. However, occupational self-efficacy can be assumed as less stable than \ngeneral self-efficacy, that is, it might be more easily influenced by corresponding \nexperience. It is also broad enough to allow comparison between different types of jobs \nor professions (Schyns & von Collani, 2002), thus making it useful for investigations in \nthe context of work and organisations. Schyns and von Collani (2002) found first \nevidence for its usefulness in organisational research and practice as indicated by the \npositive correlation between occupational self-efficacy and job satisfaction as well as \nOccupational Self-Efficacy 5 \n \norganisational commitment. Introducing a short version of the occupational self-efficacy \ninstrument, Rigotti, Schyns and Mohr (2008) found positive correlations between \noccupational self-efficacy and job satisfaction as well as performance in five different \ncountries. Berings et al. (2007) found positive correlations between occupational self-\nefficacy and some learning styles. In a recent study, Abele and Spurk (2009) found that \noccupational self-efficacy measured at career entry (with a different instrument as \nSchyns & Collani, 2002) had a positive impact on salary and status three years later as \nwell as on salary change and career satisfaction seven years later. Thus, already the \nlevel of occupational self-efficacy before entering the labour market might be important \nfor future career success.  \nLeadership and self-efficacy \nAccording to Hannah, Avolio, Luthans and Harms (2008) \u201ceffective leadership requires \nhigh levels of agency (i.e., deliberately or intentionally exerting positive influence) and \nconfidence\u201d (p. 669). Therefore, self-efficacy is important for becoming a successful \nleader in the future. The background of this assumption can be found in prior research \nhas shown that self-efficacy is positively related to performance increase (Eden & \nRavid, 1982). More importantly for our study, self-efficacy is related to leadership \nrelevant concepts. Since leadership tasks are complex (Mohr, 1999), Schyns and \nSanders (2005) argue that executing leadership is related to an increase in self-efficacy. \nHowever, the opposite is true as well: De Pater et al. (2009) have shown in a laboratory \nstudy that when assessing management potential, self-efficacy is related to the choice of \nchallenging tasks and to the motive to approach success, defined as tendency to chose \ntasks that show one\u2019s capabilities. Given the complexity of the task \u201cleadership\u201d and the \nfact that leaders are constantly confronted with new tasks, other variables such as \nOccupational Self-Efficacy 6 \n \nperformance adaptability and learning orientation seem relevant to discuss here. Prior \nresearch has shown relationships between self-efficacy and these concepts. For \nexample, self-efficacy is positively related to learning orientation (Bell & Kozlowski, \n2002). Kozlowski et al. (2001) also showed that self-efficacy is related to performance \nadaptability, meaning the adaptation of \u201cknowledge and skills to meet the demands of \nthe new situation\u201d (p. 13) as well as \u201cresilience in order to maintain motivation and \nconcentration throughout the session\u201d (p. 13). These prior studies imply that self-\nefficacy is related to behaviours that are especially relevant for becoming a successful \nleader in the future. Popper and Mayseless (2007) even regard self-efficacy as one of \nthe building blocks for leader development. \nHowever, in the area of organisational research, most research has focused on the \nself-efficacy of people already in the job (e.g., Berntson, N\u00e4swall & Sverke, 2008; \nRenkema, Schaap & van Dellen, 2009), or in training for a specific job (Tziner, Fisher, \nSenior & Weisberg, 2007). Besides the above mentioned study by Abele and Spurk \n(2009) in which occupational self-efficacy positively predicted salary and status, most \nstudies that examined self-efficacy at career entry focused on career self-efficacy (for \noverviews see Betz, 2007, and Betz & Hackett, 2006). This concept refers to \u201cthe \ndegree of confidence in their [the participants\u2019] ability to complete the educational \nrequirements\u201d (Betz & Hackett, 1981, p. 401) for different occupations. Research \nundertaken by Betz and colleagues (e.g., Betz & Hackett, 1997) investigated how self-\nefficacy influences career interests (e.g., Betz & Hackett, 1981). Other researchers used \nself-efficacy to predict career exploration behaviour (Nauta, 2007). These prior studies \nfocus either on the conceptualisation of self-efficacy relevant to education (career self-\nefficacy) or on outcomes of occupational self-efficacy as outlined above. \nOccupational Self-Efficacy 7 \n \nIn the present research we are interested in self-efficacy for a future profession and \nits relationship to self-perceptions of attributes, thus going away from the classical \nassumption that the development of self-efficacy is mainly linked to mastery \nexperience. Thus, we are interested in self-efficacy prior to job experience. Therefore, \nwe examined the relationship between self-perceptions of relevant leadership attributes \nand occupational self-efficacy among future leaders, that is, management students. We \nargue that for this group occupational self-efficacy is very important as their (future) \nwork will be characterised, for example, by challenging tasks, learning demands and \nrequirements for performance adaptability, and that people high in occupational self-\nefficacy will find it easier to achieve such tasks. As this group does not yet have \nleadership experience, and thus classical sources of self-efficacy such as mastery \nexperience and model learning are less prevalent, the interesting question is in how far \nother factors such as the perception of possessing attributes relevant to their future job \nare one important concept in this context. Thus we examined the relationship between \nself-efficacy for the future job of management students and their self-perceptions of \nleadership-relevant attributes. So far, the instrument used here to assess occupational \nself-efficacy has been used in the context of predicting outcomes for people already \nworking in a certain profession but not as a measurement to assess occupational self-\nefficacy for a future profession. This is, on the one hand, a limitation of our study, on \nthe other hand, it can add to the future use of the instrument if we find meaningful \nresults.  \nLeadership attributes: Agentic and communal attributes \nWhen it comes to the requirement of success in the area of leadership, specific attributes \nare discussed, namely agentic and communal qualities (for an overview see Eagly & \nOccupational Self-Efficacy 8 \n \nSczesny, 2008): According to Eagly (1987) communal attributes are stereotypically \nfemale. Example comprise: helpful, interpersonally sensitive and nurturing. Agentic \nattributes, in contrast, are stereotypically male attributes such as aggressive, dominant \nand independent.  \nTraditional beliefs about successful leaders contained agentic attributes, that is, \nsuccessful managers were perceived as being competitive, self-confident, objective, and \nambitious (Schein, 2001). In accordance, Abele (2003) found in her prospective study \nthat agency influenced career success in general (and career success influences agency). \nOther studies have shown that leaders are perceived as more agentic than communal \n(e.g., Powell, Butterfield, & Parent, 2002; Sczesny, 2005). \nHowever, the concept of successful leadership became somewhat less agentic over \ntime (in comparisons of 1984 and 1999 data from samples of business students; Powell \net al., 2002). Nowadays portrayals of managers also embrace communal attributes such \nas being helpful and supportive (e.g., Senge, 1990). This is supported by Eagly and \nCarli (2007) who state that despite nowadays leaders are described as having some \nfeminine attributes, masculine attributes \u201chave remained well represented\u201d (p. 91). \nThese changes in expectations towards the leadership role may explain the popularity \nof concept such as transformational leadership (e.g., Avolio, 1999; Bass, 1998). This \nconcept emphasises establishing oneself as a role model by gaining followers\u2019 trust and \nconfidence, thus it incorporates communal qualities along with agentic ones. Many \nstudies and indeed meta-analyses showed that transformational leadership behaviours \nwere positively related to effectiveness (Avolio, Weichun, Koh, & Bhatia, 2004; Bass, \nAvolio, Jung, & Berson, 2003; Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, & van Engen, 2003; Lowe, \nKroek & Sivasubramaniam, 1996).  \nOccupational Self-Efficacy 9 \n \nThis means that for future leaders it is important to possess both agentic and \ncommunal characteristics. We assume that management students are aware of the \nimportance of these attributes and will thus fell more confident about their future job if \nthey perceive themselves as possessing leadership relevant attributes. \n \nH 1: Self-ascribed leadership attributes are positively related to occupational \nself-efficacy. \n \nThough we assume that possessing attributes relevant to the leadership stereotype in \ngeneral will influence a person\u2019s self-efficacy, it might be that on an individual level, \npeople feel that these attributes are more or less important for them to possess.  \nSimilar assumptions have been made in the context of the Self-Concept Enhancing \nTactician model (SCENT; Sedikides & Strube, 1997) in a study by Gaertner, Sedikides \nand Chang (2008). The Self-Concept Enhancing Tactician model assumes that people \nstrive for self-enhancement and this is often done \u201cindirectly through attempts to self-\nverify, self-assess, or self-improve (what we call tactical self-enhancement)\u201d (Sedikides \n& Strube, 1997, p. 225). Thus, in our context, people may indicate to possess leadership \nrelevant attributes in order to enhance their self-concept. In their study, Gaertner et al. \n(1997) asked participants to rate to what extend relative to peers they possess an \nattribute and how important they find this attribute. They found that a combination of \npossessing an attribute and rating it as important lead to, for example, higher subjective \nwell-being and satisfaction with life. We assume that a similar combination of \npossession and importance is positively related to occupational self-efficacy. \nOccupational Self-Efficacy 10 \n \nConsequently, the perception that one possesses attributes that one personally considers \nimportant will influence the person\u2019s occupational self-efficacy. Thus, we assume: \n \nH 2: The relationships between self-ascribed leadership attributes and \noccupational self-efficacy are moderated by the importance ratings of these \nattributes. \n \nMethod \nDesign and Procedure \nThe data presented here were part of a larger study (see Sczesny, Bosak, Neff, &Schyns, \n2004). Management students were asked to fill in a questionnaire placed it in the \ncontext of executive selection. They were asked to estimate in how far they belief \nthemselves to possess task- and person-oriented attributes and how important they \nbelieve these attribute to be for themselves. In addition, they were questioned about \ntheir occupational self-efficacy for their future job. The questioning took place after \nlectures. Participation was voluntary. Confidentiality of the data was assured.  \nParticipants \nOne hundred thirty-six management students from Australia, Germany and India took \npart in the study. As a prior analysis of this data (Sczesny et al., 2004) did not yield \ncultural differences, the data were combined for the analyses. The German sample (N = \n66; male = 37 and female = 29) was collected at two universities (University of \nMannheim and University of Leipzig). Their average age was M = 23.0 (SD = 2.39) \nyears. Of the German participants, 21.5% had completed a training prior to their studies. \nOf the Australian university students (N = 33; male = 17 and female = 17), 36.4% had \nOccupational Self-Efficacy 11 \n \ndone some sort of training. Their average age was M = 20.3 (SD = 2.77) years. In India, \n37 university students took part in the study (28 male and 8 female students). Their \naverage age was M = 24.1 (SD = 2.98) years. Half of these students had completed \nsome sort of training (50%). \nMeasures \nSelf-ascribed leadership attributes. Thirty-four attributes were presented to assess \nleadership relevant attributes. The selection of the items goes back to a study by \nSczesny et al. (2004). The participants rated on a four-point scale in how far they think \nthey possess these skills. Although the general instructions for the questionnaire were \nplaced in the context of executive selection these attributes were not introduced to the \nparticipants as leadership attributes. We differentiated two factors, task- and person-\noriented attributes (for an overview of the items see appendix). The answer scale ranged \nfrom 1 = no, 2 = rather no, 3 = rather yes and 4 = yes. The reliability for eighteen task-\noriented items was .83. The reliability for sixteen person-oriented items was .78.  \nValence of leadership attributes. Participants were asked to rate the same 34 items \nwith respect to how important they find it to possess them on a scale from 0 = not at all \nimportant to 6 = extremely important. The reliability for eighteen task-oriented items \nwas .84. The reliability for sixteen person-oriented items was .79.  \nOccupational self-efficacy. For the assessment of occupational self-efficacy we \npresented the participants a short version of the Occupational Self-Efficacy-Scale \n(OCCSEFF; Schyns & Collani, 2002). Schyns and Collani (2002) showed that \noccupational self efficacy represents a reliable, one-dimensional construct. Its \nrelationship to personality constructs (general self-efficacy, self-esteem, internal control \nbeliefs, and neuroticism) and to organisational variables (e.g., task demands, leader-\nOccupational Self-Efficacy 12 \n \nmember exchange, job satisfaction, and commitment) shows acceptable construct and \ncriterion validity. The students were asked to indicate how confident they feel with \nrespect to their future profession on a scale from 1 = applies to me not at all to 6 = applies \nto me completely. Sample items comprise: \u201cWhen unexpected problems occur in my \nwork, I don\u2019t handle them very well\u201d and \u201cI can remain calm when facing difficulties in \nmy job because I can rely on my abilities\u201d. The internal consistency of the scale was \nCronbach\u2019s  = .78. \nTable 1 depicts the means, standard deviations and intercorrelations between the \nvariables.  \n \nResults \nPreliminary analysis \nBefore testing the hypotheses, we took a closer look at demographic variable: The \ncorrelations between age and self-efficacy (r = -.04, n.s.), between age and task-oriented \nattributes (r = -.11, n.s.), between age and person-oriented attributes (r = -.06, n.s.), \nbetween age and importance of task-oriented attributes (r = -.13, n.s.) and between age \nand importance of person-oriented attributes (r = -.05, n.s.) were all non-significant. \nOver all countries men and women did not differ with respect to occupational self-\nefficacy (Mmen = 4.38 and Mwomen = 4.39; t (129) = -0.05, n.s.), with respect to task-\noriented attributes (Mmen = 3.11 and Mwomen = 3.11; t (129) = 0.11, n.s.), with respect to \nimportance of task-oriented attributes (Mmen = 4.33 and Mwomen = 4.45; t (129) = -1.01, \nn.s.) or with respect to importance of person-oriented attributes Mmen = 4.36 and Mwomen \n= 4.57; t (126) = -1.84, n.s.), However, men and women differed significantly with \nOccupational Self-Efficacy 13 \n \nrespect to person-oriented attributes (Mmen = 3.18 and Mwomen = 3.34; t (130) = -2.69, p < \n.01). Therefore, gender was controlled in some of the analyses. \nOver all countries participants with training and without training did not differ with \nrespect to occupational self-efficacy (Mtraining = 4.41 and Mno training = 4.38; t (127) = \n0.24, n.s.), with respect to task-oriented attributes (Mtraining = 3.09 and Mno training = 3.11; \nt (127) = -0.31, n.s.), with respect person-oriented attributes (Mtraining = 3.22 and Mno \ntraining = 3.26; t (128) = -0.54, n.s.), with respect importance of task-oriented attributes \n(Mtraining = 4.34 and Mno training = 4.39; t (127) = -0.44, n.s.), with respect importance of \nperson-oriented attributes (Mtraining = 4.45 and Mno training = 4.46; t (127) = -0.13, n.s.).  \nTherefore, the demographic variables were not taken into account when testing the \nhypotheses.  \nHypotheses testing \nOur results confirm Hypothesis 1 (Self-ascribed leadership attributes are positively \nrelated to occupational self-efficacy). The correlation is positive for both task- and \nperson-oriented attributes (r = .48 and r = .36, respectively). As the correlations seem \nquite different in size, we conducted a test for the comparison of correlation (Preacher, \n2002). However, it showed no significant correlation differences. We also conducted a \nregression analysis with gender as a control and including both types of leadership \nattributes. As can be seen from Table 2, both task-oriented and person-oriented \nattributes were significantly related to occupational self-efficacy, although the latter \nonly on the 10% level.  \nIn order to test Hypothesis 2 (The relationships between self-ascribed leadership \nattributes and occupational self-efficacy are moderated by the importance ratings of \nthese attributes), we conducted a moderated regression analysis. Following the \nOccupational Self-Efficacy 14 \n \nrecommendations by Aiken and West (1991), the variables in the regression analysis \nwere mean-centred. The interaction between task-oriented attributes and task-oriented \nattributes (importance) reached significance on the 10% level (see Table 2). Figure 1 \nindicates that the correlation is higher for high importance, thus lending support to H2 \non the 10% level for task-oriented attributes. For person-oriented attributes, the \ninteraction was not significant (see Table 3).  \nDiscussion \nSelf-efficacy is an important personal resource. It has a strong relationship to career \ndevelopment as could be shown by Betz and colleagues (e.g. Betz, 1994; Betz & \nHackett, 1997; Betz & Voyten, 1997). Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate \nthe occupational self-efficacy of management students with respect to their future jobs. \nWe assumed that self-perceived leadership relevant attributes (task- as well as person-\noriented attributes) are an important correlate of occupational self-efficacy for this \ngroup. Results indicate a positive relationship between the self-perceived leadership \nrelevant attributes and occupational self-efficacy, for both task- and person-oriented \nattributes. The effect is slightly higher for task- oriented attributes, though not \nsignificantly so. In addition, in terms of the moderating effect of valence, only the effect \nfor task-oriented attributes becomes (marginally) significant. This tendency indicates \nthat although for all students there is a correlation between possessing task-oriented \nattributes and occupational self-efficacy, this correlation is stronger for students who \ntend to find task-oriented attributes important. However, the same result did not emerge \nfor person-oriented attributes. Several reasons can be responsible for this tendency \n(though, this finding has to be replicated in a further study). One could assume that \nstudents find these attributes so important that the possession of these attributes is \nOccupational Self-Efficacy 15 \n \nrelated to occupational self-efficacy in all cases. However, the importance ratings did \nnot differ much for task- or person-oriented attributes. One assumption is that due to \ntheir training in business studies (rather than, e.g., psychology which is more person-\noriented), the importance of task-oriented attributes and whether or not they possess \nthese attributes is more salient and leads to the interaction we found.  \nAs outlined in the introduction, prior research has shown that (occupational) self-\nefficacy is related to positive organisational outcomes, such as job satisfaction (Cohrs, \nAbele & Dette, 2006; Rigotti et al., 2008) or well-being (Almudever, Croity-Belz & \nFraccaroli, 2006). In our research we focused on occupational self-efficacy for a future \njob and the role of job-relevant attributes. As far as we know this is a new approach to \noccupational self-efficacy. In future research, it would be important to combine our \nresults with prior studies and examine in how far occupational self-efficacy for a future \njob can predict, for example, job satisfaction when people have actually started working \nin the respective job.  \nRecently, Nauta, van Vianen, van der Heijden, van Dam and Willemsen (2009) \nfound that self-efficacy is related to employability orientation (defined in line with van \nDam, 2004, as a person\u2019s \u201creceptivity towards employability within their current \norganization\u201d, Nauta et al., 2009, p. 239). Schyns, Torka and Goessling (2007) found \nthat occupational self-efficacy is related to preparedness for change, that is, the desire \nfor a task with higher task demands within or outside the organisation. These studies \nindicate that for people who already work in an organisation self-efficacy can enhance \nwithin or between organisation employability. With respect to occupational self-efficacy \nfor a future job, we would expect a similar result, that is, that occupational self-efficacy \nfor a future job is related to employability.  \nOccupational Self-Efficacy 16 \n \nImplications for career counselling  \nGiven our results for occupational self-efficacy, for career counselling it seems \nimportant to have a look at the self-description of individuals in terms of attributes \nrelevant to their future job. Similar approaches are common in career counselling. A \nmodel used very often in this context is Holland\u2019s (1997; originally published in 1973) \napproach. Holland uses six personality types (realistic, investigative, artistic, social, \nenterprising, and conventional) to describe persons. He uses the same characteristics to \ndescribe working environments. The match between person and environment is then \nused to predict, for example, vocational choice and achievement. On the basis of self-\nratings, our results imply that a match between person characteristics and characteristics \nthat are important for a certain profession are related to occupational self-efficacy. In \ncontrast to Holland, however, the attributes used in this study are less related to a \ngeneral environment but more specific to a leadership task. Thus, they could be used to \nassess people\u2019s (subjective) suitability for a leadership position. It may be difficult to \nimprove occupational self-efficacy for someone who has not worked in a certain job. In \nthis case, career counselling might focus (similar to Holland\u2019s approach) on analysing \nand feeding back the degree to which a person possesses relevant attributes. Thus, rather \nthan using mastery experience or model learning, this approach would make use of \nverbal persuasion in improving occupational self-efficacy (cf. Bandura, 1977). The \nproblem here is, of course, that we assessed the subjective possession of attributes rather \nthan objective attributes of a person. While the subjective possession may be very \nimportant to one\u2019s self-efficacy, we cannot recommend to exclusively rely on subjective \nratings in career counselling. Rather, counsellors need to include objective attributes as \nwell in order to make a good prediction of career success.  \nOccupational Self-Efficacy 17 \n \nFor future research into the application of our results into career counselling, it \nwould be interesting to take into account how realistic the self-description of a person \nis. A more realistic image of a person could be achieved using different sources of \ndescription, such as peer-rating, and match them to the self-description. Gathering this \ninformation can again be useful in career counselling, for example, when an individual \nfirst needs to be made aware that he\/she possesses relevant attributes for a particular \njob. \nLimitation and future research  \nIn this study, we only looked at self-descriptions as they are most important for self-\nefficacy ratings. One limitation is that we used an instrument to assess occupational \nself-efficacy that has not been established to assess occupational self-efficacy for a \nfuture profession. We do not know in how far our instructions were sufficient to trigger \nthe focus on future profession in our participants. Future studies could use a stronger \ninstruction for this instrument. Relatedly, it might be that participants had different \nprofessions in mind when responding to the occupational self-efficacy questions. \nHowever, one of the features of this instrument is that it can be used to assess \noccupational self-efficacy for different professions. Therefore, it is not as important for \nthis assessment that participants think of comparable jobs when responding to the \nquestions as it would be for more task-specific measures of self-efficacy. \nAlthough different cultures might influence the sources of self-efficacy (as Hesketh \n& Rounds, 1995, assume), we did not assume different effects for different cultures as \nmanagement students even in different countries are part of a very similar subculture. \nThus, for the students the demands of their future profession is more important for their \noccupational self-efficacy than their cultural background. Prior results concerning the \nOccupational Self-Efficacy 18 \n \nattribution of attributes to leaders in general in these three countries support this \nassumption: Sczesny et al. (2004) did not find differences between Indian, Australian \nand German management students with respect to attribution of task- and person-\noriented attributes. In all three countries managers in general were assumed to posses \nmore task-oriented than person-oriented attributes. Results of studies focusing on more \ncultural-specific types of self-efficacy, however, may find different results than we \nfound.   \nThe sample size was quite small for some of the subgroups thus not allowing for \ncomparisons such as a comparison of male and female participants from different \ncountries. Nevertheless the study provides initial hints at the relationship between self-\ndescription and occupational self-efficacy. However, it might be valuable to take a \ncloser look on gender as well as on culture in future studies. \n \nOccupational Self-Efficacy 19 \n \nReferences \nAbele, A. E. (2003).
