In order to\ncreate homogeneous recognition sites the covalent immobilisation of the template HSA\nwas exploited. Imprinted beads resulted selective for HAS. The indirect imprinting\nfactor (IF) calculated from supernatant was of 1.6 and the direct IF, evaluated from the\nprotein recovered from the beads, was 1.9. The binding capacity was 1.4 mg\/g,\ncomparable to commercially available affinity materials. The specificity of the HSA\nrecognition was evaluated with competitive experiments, indicating a molar ratio 4.5\/1\nof competitor was necessary to displace half of the bound HSA. The recognition and\nbinding of the imprinted beads was tested also with a complex sample, the human\nserum sample, showing a targeted removal of HSA, without a loss of the other protein\ncomponents. The easy preparation protocol of derivatised beads and a good protein\nrecognition make the approach attractive to resolve analytical and bio-analytical\nproblems in the field of biotechnology.\n3Introduction\nMolecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are polymers prepared in presence of a\ntemplate, that serves as a mould for the formation of template-complementary binding\nsites [Mosbach, 1994; Sellergren, 2001]. Thus, MIPs can be created to recognise a\nlarge variety of target molecules often with affinity and selectivity comparable to those\nexhibited by poly- or mono-clonal antibodies. MIPs are less expensive and quicker to\nprepare than biological receptors. Additionally, they are capable of withstanding much\nharsher conditions, such as high temperature, pressure, extreme pH, and organic\nsolvents as compared to antibodies. These properties have made them extremely\nattractive for solving problems in the fields of preparative chemical separations\n(Sellergren, 2001 a-b), solid phase extraction (Lanza and Sellengren, 2001; Andersson\nand Schweitz, 2003) and sensing (Chianella et al., 2003; Haupt and Mosbach, 2000), or\nfor the removal of specific molecular targets from food (Whitcombe et al., 1997;\nRamstrom et al., 2001).\nMIPs have been prepared using as template molecule polypeptides (Kempe et\nal.,1995; Andersson et al.,1995; Minoura and Rachkov, 2000), bacteria (Dickert and\nHayden, 2002), low molecular mass compounds (Katz and Davis, 2000; Chianella et\nal., 2003) and proteins (Burow and Minoura, 1996; Bossi et al., 2001; Guo et al.,\n2004).\nIn the case of proteins, however, only some modest results have been obtained. The\nmain problem is strictly dependent on the specific properties of these templates. First,\nall proteins are water-soluble compounds that are not always compatible with\nmainstream MIP technologies, which relies on the use of organic solvents for the\npolymer preparation. Secondly, proteins have a large amount of functional groups\navailable for the interaction with functional monomers. Thirdly, proteins have a flexible\n4structure and conformation, which can be easily affected by changes in environmental\ntemperature, or in dependence to the solvent. Thus, from a thermodynamic and\npractical standpoint, it is difficult to develop successful imprints for such molecules.\nIn the last ten years, some new approaches have been proposed. These approaches\nfollows both the covalent and non covalent approaches [Wulff, 1993; Mosbach and\nRamstrom, 1996]. The immobilisation of the protein template on a supporting surface\n[Shi et al., 1999; Yilmaz et al., 2000, Shiomi et al., 2005], gives a number of\nadvantages, i.e. allows the imprinting of templates independently to their solubility into\nthe polymerisation mix, it minimises protein aggregation, and it creates more\nhomogeneous binding sites.\nIn the present contribution, we report the preparation of imprinted beads for the\nrecognition of Human Serum Albumin (HSA). The protein template is immobilised at the\nsurface of the beads, with an approach modified from Shiomi and co-workers in 2005\n[Shiomi et al., 2005], in which covalent immobilisation was achieved by derivatising\nsilica beads with aldehyde groups, exploited next for forming imine bonds with the\namino groups of lysine of HSA. The polymer was made of 3-aminophenyl boronic acid\n(APBA) [Piletsky et al., 2001; Bossi et al., 2001; Pribyl and Skladal, 2005] with a\npolymerisation process was described earlier by our group [Bossi et al., 2001].\nThe beads thus obtained, were characterised in order to evaluate the polymer\nderivatisation percentage, the binding capacity for HSA, the binding kinetics, the\nspecificity of the HSA binding and the recovery of bound protein.\nFinally, the imprinted beads were applied to a real biological fluid, human serum, in\nwhich HSA is the most abundant protein (ca. 60% of the total proteins) [Anderson and\nAnderson, 2002; Tirumalai et al., 2003]. The high quantity of HSA in serum is\nconsidered as a drawback, since it seriously hampers the detection of low abundant\nproteins, which are often marker of diseases. It has been demonstrated that if serum is\n5selectively depleted of albumin, it would facilitate the analysis of such low-abundant\nproteins. Albumin removal has been achieved through adsorption to immobilized dyes\n[Ahmed N., et al., 2003], or immuno-affinity extraction [Wang et al., 2003], or affinity\ncapture by immobilized phage-derived peptides [Sato et al., 2002], but to date no\nreports concern the use of molecularly imprinted polymers. In the present case, we\nattempt the use of a synthetic receptor, the imprinted beads, for the specific removal of\nHSA from serum.\nMaterials and Methods.\nMaterials and reagents\nAcetic Acid, Aminopropyl silica (particle size 15-40 um, mean pore size 60 A), 3-Amino\npropyl trimethoxysilane (APTMS), Ammonium persulfate (APS), Bradford Assay, [3-\ncholamidopropyl dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), Ethanol, Glycine,\nGlutaraldehyde, Human Serum Albumin (HSA) (Mr 66 kDa), Methilic Acid, 2 N-\nMorpholine Ethane Sulfonic Acid (MES), Oxalic Acid, Propyl Triethoxy Silane, Sodium\nChloride (NaCl), SDS, Sypro Ruby, Thiourea, Trizma, Urea, were obtained from Sigma\nAldrich Chemie GmbH (Steinheim, Germany).\nAcrylamide, N,N-methylenebisacrylamide, N,N,N,N tetramethyl-ethylenediamine\n(TEMED), dithiothreitol (DTT), linear Immobiline dry strips pH gradient 3-10 (7 cm) were\nobtained from Bio-rad (Hercules, CA, USA).\nPreparation of Human Serum Albumin (HSA)-imprinted silica using immobilized\ntemplates.\n6A 1 g of silica beads were derivatised with 10% (w\/v) APTMS in methanol, in order to\nintroduce NH2 functional groups. Afterwards, the beads were washed three times with\nethanol and three times with deionised water, after that they were dried at 50\u00b0C for 24\nhours. They were then incubated with 10 mM 2-N-Morpholino Ethane Sulfonic Acid\n(MES) buffer pH 5.5 containing 1% glutaraldehyde, and the mixture was incubated for\n12 hours at room temperature, in order to introduce aldehyde groups. The product was\nwashed repeatedly with deionised water, and finally 1 ml of a 10 mM 3-N-Morpholino\nPropane Sulfonic Acid (MOPS) solution (pH 7.0) containing 2.0 mg\/ml Human Serum\nAlbumin (HSA) and 0.1 M NaCl was admixed as the template for 3 h at 4\u00b0C, in order to\nbind covalently the protein on the aldehyde groups. After, the beads were incubated with\n1 M Tris, in order to block the un-reacted aldehyde groups. Washes with deionised\nwater followed, and finally 50 mM ABPA water solution was added to the beads. After\n45 min incubation, 25 mM ammonium persulfate (APS) water solution was added in\norder to start the polymerisation reaction. The polymerisation was carried out at room\ntemperature for 1 h, after that the beads were washed again with deionised water.\nFinally, 1 ml of 1 M oxalic acid was added in order to remove the template. This step\nwas carried out at room temperature for 12 h. The beads were finally conditioned with\n10 mM phosphate buffer pH 8.0, in order to increase the pH and remove the free HSA in\nsolution produced by the treatment with 1 M oxalic acid.\nEvaluation percentage of derivatisation\nIn order to evaluate the percentage of silica beads derivatisation, 0.500 g of beads were\nderivatised (with APTMS, glutaraldehyde, APBA, as previously described). After each\nstep, the beads were dried overnight at 87\u00b0C and they were weighted. The percentage\nof derivatisation was calculated as (mg of \u201cpolymer\u201d bound\/g beads)*100.\n7Calculation of the binding capacity.\nIn order to evaluate the binding capacity, a 0.500 g of beads were conditioned with 10\nmM phosphate buffer pH 8.0 and incubated with 300 ul of HSA solution at different\nconcentrations (0.036, 0.058, 0.073, 0.18, 0.3, 1.0, 2.6, 2.74 and 4.08 ug\/ul) for different\ntimes (3, 5, 20, 60 minutes). The beads were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 3 minutes at\nroom temperature, then the supernatant was transferred in new tubes and it was\nquantified by Bradford Assay at 595 nm. The protein bound was expressed as the\ndifference between the total micrograms of HSA loaded and micrograms of HSA in\nsolution after the binding.\nThe binding kinetic.\nIn order to evaluate the binding kinetic, a 0.500 g of control or MIP beads, conditioned\nwith 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 8.0, were incubated with 300 ul of HSA solution at\ndifferent concentrations (0.036, 0.058, 0.073, 0.18, 0.3, 1.0, 2.6, 2.74 and 4.08 ug\/ul) for\ndifferent times (3, 5, 20, 60 minutes). The quantity of bound protein was evaluated as\ndescribed in the previous paragraph.\nThe protocol for HSA elution from the beads\nIn order to evaluate the quantity of protein bound from beads, a 15 mg of control or MIP\nbeads, conditioned with 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 8.0, were incubated with 300 ul of\n0.1 ug\/ul HSA solution for 5 minutes. The beads were washed once with 10 mM\nphosphate buffer pH 8.0. The supernatant was discarded and the beads were incubated\nwith a solution of 7% acetic acid and 0.1% Tween-20. After 10 minutes the beads were\ncentrifuged and the supernatant was recovered, and the proteins were precipitated with\n8 volumes of cold acetone and analysed through SDS-PAGE.\n8Binding experiment with human serum\nIn order to evaluate the binding of HSA from a real complex sample, 0.300 g of MIP\nbeads, conditioned with 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 8.0, were incubated with 300 ul of\n0.1 ug\/ul human serum solution for 5 minutes. The beads were washed as previously\ndescribed. The supernatant was recovered and the proteins were precipitated and\nanalysed through 2D-PAGE.\nSDS-PAGE and 2D PAGE\nElectrophoresis of proteins was performed using regular SDS PAGE with 12%\npolyacrylamide gel, with a Tris-Glycine cathode buffer (192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS and\n40 mM Tris to pH 8.3). The run was performed by applying 15 mA\/gel for 20 min\nfollowed by 25 mA\/gel until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel.\nFor 2D-maps, instead, the desired volume of each sample was subjected to protein\nprecipitation in a cold mixture of acetone and methanol (v\/v ratio 8:1), for removing lipids\nand salts and for regulating the concentration of protein samples, for 2 hours at -20\u00b0C;\nthe solution was then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 20 minutes. The pellet was solubilised\nin the 2-D sample buffer (7M urea, 2M thiourea, 3% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)\ndimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, 40mM TRIS, 5mM tributylphosphine, and 10mM\nacrylamide) and allowed to be alkylated at room temperature for 90 minutes. For\nblocking the alkylation reaction, 10 mM dithiothreitol was used, and then 0.5%\nAmpholine and bromophenol blue in traces were added to the solution. An aliquot (150\nml) of protein solution was subsequently used for rehydrating 7 cm long immobilized pH\ngradient (IPG) strips (Bio-Rad), pH 3 to 10 not linear, for 4 hours. Isoelectric focusing\n(IEF) was performed with a Protean IEF Cell (Bio-Rad) at low initial voltage, followed by\na voltage gradient up to 5000 V; the total product time voltage applied was 25000\n9voltage hour for each strip. For the second dimension, the IPGs strips were equilibrated\nfor 26 minutes in a solution containing 6 mM urea, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 375 mM\nTris-HCl, pH 8.8, under gentle shaking. The IPG strips were then laid on an 8% to 18%\nT-gradient SDS\u2013gel slab and cemented in situ with 0.5% agarose in the cathode buffer\n(192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS, and Tris to pH 8.3). The electrophoretic run was performed\nby setting a current of 5 mA\/gel for 1 hour, followed by 10 mA\/gel for 1 hour and 20\nmA\/gel until run completation.\nFinally, for SDS-PAGE and 2D-maps, gels were incubated in a fixing solution containing\n40% ethanol and 10% acetic acid for 1 h, followed by overnight staining in a ready-to-\nuse Sypro Ruby solution. Destaining was performed in 10% methanol and 7% acetic\nacid, followed by a rinse of at least 3 h in pure water. The gels were scanned with a\nVersa Doc Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and analysed with the software\nPDQuest Version 7.1 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). A match set was created from the\nprotein patterns of three replicate gels for each independent samples. A standard gel\nwas generated out of the image with the highest spot number. Spot quantities of all gels\nwere normalized to remove non expression-related variations in spot intensity. The\nresults were evaluated in terms of spot OD (optical density).\nResults and discussion\nAminophenylboronate based molecularly imprinted polymers were prepared according\nto the scheme depicted in Figure 1. The approach includes at first exploiting silica beads\nas supports for the template (HSA) immobilisation, followed by the polymerisation of the\nhomopolymeric material onto the derivatised beads and finally the cleavage of the\nprotein-silica covalent bonds resulting in leaving the imprinted cavities freely accessible\nfor binding.\n10\nThe silica beads were derivatised with 10% APTMS in order to introduce NH2 groups.\nNext, a treatment with 1% glutaraldehyde was performed to introduce aldehydic groups.\nThe immobilisation of the protein on the surface of the silica beads happens through\ncovalent bond between \uf065 amino groups of lysine of template and aldehyde groups on\nthe silica beads.\nAPBA was used as functional monomer. The polymerisation procedure, is\nstraightforward: a 1:1 (v\/v) ratio of the ammonium persulfate (50 mM) and APBA (100\nmM) solution in water were let react together in presence of the protein-derivatised\nbeads for 1 h, gently stirred at room temperature (Bossi et al., 2001; Bossi et al.,\n2004). Study on the polymerisation of monomers of the same family of ABPA (e.g.\naniline) showed that the polymer in solution forms relatively short chains (Mattoso et\nal.,1995), flocculating in aggregates, while on the supporting surface, it deposits in a\nreasonably thin and ordered film (Mc Quade et al., 2000).\nAfter APBA polymerisation, it is necessary remove the HSA immobilised at the surface\nof the beads for getting free binding cavities. Strong acids have to be used in order to\nbreak the silica-protein covalent bonds. Thus, incubation in 1M oxalic acid for 12 hours\nwas adopted as removing procedure (Shiomi et al., 2005). Subsequently, washing\nsteps were performed to remove the protein released from the beads and to condition\nthe beads in a buffer suitable for the binding experiments. In order to remove HSA and\nto increase the pH from 1.2 to 8.0, six washes with 10 mM phosphate buffer were\nperformed. After each washing step, the pH of the solution was measured and the\nproteins removed were recovered by acetone precipitation and analysed by SDS\nPAGE, followed by quantification of the HSA released through densitometry analysis.\nThe data were then plotted as a function of the number of the washing steps, as shown\nin Figure 2 No free template was detected in solution after seven washing steps.\n11\nMoreover, after seven washes, the pH of the solution had risen to 8.0, that is the pH\nchosen for the binding experiments.\nIt is probable that a small part of the HSA previously bound to the beads remains\nembedded in the polymer matrix. The contribution of such remaining template might be\nnegative occupying the binding sites of the polymer and thus affecting its rebinding\nproperties. Nevertheless there are many documents reporting a positive effect of the\nnon-complete removal of the embedded template. As reported by Hjerten and co-\nworkers, the residual template can improve the mechanical stability of the polymer\narchitecture, conferring rigidity to the binding sites (Hjerten et al., 1997).\nThe quantity of the polymer deposited on the beads was evaluated too. Starting from a\nknown quantity of beads, the weight of the beads batch was monitored after each\nderivatisation step, after drying. The quantity of APTMS bound was 55.3 \uf0b1 0.5 mg\/g\nbeads; the quantity of glutaraldehyde was 54.0 \uf0b1 0.5 mg\/g beads. The quantity of\nABPA deposed around the silica beads was 15.2 \uf0b1 0.5 mg of polymer per gram of\nbeads. It is probable that the treatment with oxalic acid, used to remove the covalently\nbound HSA, removes few superficial layers of APBA MIP-polymer too. A qualitative\nevaluation of the persistence of the dark brown colour of the APBA-beads suggests\nthat, in any case, part of ABPA layers resist to the strong acidic treatment.\nBinding experiments were performed in order to evaluate the binding capacity for HSA of\nboth control and imprinted APBA beads. Control and MIP beads (0.500 g), conditioned\nwith 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 8.0, were incubated with increasing quantities of HSA.\nThe quantity of bound protein was evaluated by difference, measuring the residual free\nprotein in the supernatant. The micrograms bound were plotted as a function of the\nquantity of HSA used, as shown in Figure 3 No difference in the amount of bound\nprotein was observed between control and MIP beads when the quantity of protein used\nwas below 780 ug, while a difference was observed, when the quantity of protein used\n12\nwas above 780 ug. The difference between MIP and ctrl beads correlates with the\nquantity of available binding sites. When the protein quantity is not enough to saturate\nthe unspecific binding, there is no difference between ctrl and MIP beads, but when HSA\nis saturating (\uf03e 780 ug), the presence of specific binding cavities on MIP becomes\nevident. The indirect binding capacities, calculated from the quantity of HSA left\nunbound in the supernatant, was 1.4 mg\/g for MIP beads and 0.9 mg\/g for control.\nThese values are in accordance to binding capacities reported for commercial affinity\nmaterials.\nKinetic experiments were performed to evaluate the optimum binding time within\nthe range 0.5 - 60 min. The binding kinetic was evaluated for concentrations of HSA\nranging from 0.073 ug\/ul to 4.1 ug\/ul. As shown in Figure 4, the best incubation time\nwas 5 minutes, irrespectively to the HSA concentration used. The result is confirmed by\nthe profile of the time course of the imprinting factor (IF, ug bound by MIP \/ ug bound by\nctrl) plotted in Figure 5, showing a maximum IF of 1.6\uf0b1 0.08 for high HSA concentration\nat 5 min and a maximum IF of 1.2 \uf0b1 0.05 for low, non saturating, concentrations. The\nbinding profile (Figure 4b and 5) for non saturating HSA concentrations indicates that for\nshort incubation times (<5 min) the HSA molecules approach the surface and sticks\nrandomly to it (IF is only slightly in favour of MIPs). When the incubation time rises up to\n5 min, the binding to specific cavities is appreciable and maximised (IF reach its\nmaximum), as if the total quantity of protein bound does not change significantly respect\n3 min, but as if a thermodynamic driven rearrangement of the bound proteins took place\nand proteins on MIP move to the specific cavities. Finally, for longer incubation time (20-\n60 min), the specific binding sites are saturated and proteins get bound un-specifically.\nThe same does not apply to the high concentration of HSA (4.1 ug\/ul), accounting for\nenough protein to get a fast saturation of unspecific binding sites. In the case, once the\nmaximum IF reached at 5 min it maintains almost constant over the time course.\n13\nThe recovery of the bound protein onto the beads was next evaluated. A protocol\nfor protein elution was optimised. Particularly, after binding, five different conditions for\nelution HSA from beads were tried, in order to select the most effective washing\nprocedure. The first protocol is made of 7 M Urea, 2.2 M Thiourea, 3% CHAPS, 40 mM\nTris, pH 8.0 (TUC buffer), that is a strongly denaturant buffer. It is usually applied to treat\nsample before 2D-gel electrophoresis (Righetti et al., 2004). The second one is TUC\nbuffer, followed by 9 M Urea and 5% acetic acid pH 3.0 which is usually applied for\nprotein elution from affinity capture beads, as described by Fortis and co-workers (Fortis\net al., 2005 a-b). The third one is 7% Acetic Acid, 0.1% Tween 20. This solution was\nreported for washing APBA-MIPs polymers from Bossi and co-workers (Bossi et al.,\n2001). The forth one is an acidic buffer supplemented with salt to increase the ionic\nstrength: 0.1 M glycine pH 3.0, 0.5 M NaCl and finally the last one is a high ionic strength\nsolution 1 M NaCl. The quantity of HSA eluted was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. As\nreported in Table 1, no protein release was observed for alkaline washing, while washing\nwith acid or high ionic strength allowed to recover the HSA. However, among all the\nprotocols applied only the protocol number 3 has supplied good results, similar to those\nattended from Bradford Assay. The other protocols allowed to recover a little quantity of\nprotein, thus in all the following experiments, washing with 7% acetic acid 0.1% Tween-\n20 was adopted for elution of the protein from beads.\nFrom these results, it was possible to calculate a direct binding capacity for MIP and ctrl\n(calculated from the quantity of HSA recovered from the beads), which was 0.696 mg\/g\non MIP beads and 0.363 mg\/g on ctrl. The advantage of a direct calculation of binding\ncapacity is the elimination of part of the unspecific contributions. The consequence is\nfairly lower values of binding capacities, respect those calculated indirectly, whereas a\nsignificant increase in the IF 1.91 was observed, thus indicating the binding cavities on\nthe imprinted beads are specific for HSA recognition.\n14\nIn order to evaluate the specificity of binding, a competitive experiment was\nperformed (see Figure 6). The beads were assayed for the rebinding with a mixture\nmade of a fixed concentration of the template and an increasing concentration of a\ncompeting protein. The quantity of the protein bound to the beads was evaluated after\nelution from beads and SDS-PAGE. The competitor chosen was Carbonic Anhydrase\n(CA), which has approximately the same isoelectric point of HSA but a smaller molecular\nmass (31 kDa), (Righetti and Caravaggio, 1976). The shape effect on the binding was\nevaluated. In control beads, the HSA binding (approximately 3.5 \uf0b1 0.5 ug) is not\nperturbed by the addition of CA, accounting for the un-specificity of the binding. In the\nMIP, no displacement was observed for CA\/HSA molar ratio lower than 3.5\/1, while the\naddition of the CA competitor at ratio 4.5\/1 respect HSA displaces half of the HSA\nbound, and CA\/HSA ratio above 8\/1 give rise to a complete displacement of the HSA\nbinding, which decreases from 10.3 ug to the unspecific level of 3.5 ug. These\npreliminary results indicate that only for relative high concentrations of competitor the\nHSA binding is displaced. It follows that samples like human serum, which contains\napproximately the 60-80% of albumin, the problem of competition for the imprinted\nbinding sites might be negligible. For these reasons, the last part of our work was\ndevoted to the evaluation of the binding performance of imprinted beads on the real\nbiological fluid human serum. Serum samples are composed of thousands of proteins\nand peptides, released from various organs and travelling through the body through the\nvessel communication system, accounting for a high complexity of such fluid. Despite\nalbumin and immunoglobulins constitute the vast majority of the proteic fraction of serum\n(ca. 90%), the main interest is focused on the low represented proteins, as their\npresence or their quantitative variations are often correlated to pathological states.\nTherefore, methods for an efficient removal of HSA are highly welcomed, as they permit\ntracing and analysing low abundant proteins, usually masked by serum HSA. In the\n15\npresent research we attempted the use of the imprinted beads for albumin removal.\nSerum samples were incubated with imprinted beads, the supernatants recovered and\ntheir proteins precipitated with TCA. Recovered proteins were subjected to bi-\ndimensional (2D) electrophoresis analysis. The 2D maps of untreated serum and serum\ndepleted of albumin with imprinted beads were analysed with the software PDquest\n(Biorad, Hercules, CA) and are shown in Figure 7. The total number of protein spots\ncounted for serum was 124 and 116 for MIP-treated serum, indicating again the\nimprinted beads are targeted for the binding of HSA and does not remove randomly\nother serum components. By analysing the optical density of the albumin spot, a\ndecrease was reported for serum depleted with imprinted beads, in fact the spot\nintensity decreases of a factor 1.7 \uf0b1 0.3 upon treatment (i.e. the 58% HSA was\nremoved). The quantity of albumin removed with the beads was of 183 ug, starting from\n311 ug of HSA. It can be concluded that the imprinted beads remove the protein target\nalso in a complex fluid, leaving nearly unchanged the other proteins. The removal\nprocess is easy and straightforward, being the optimal incubation time of 5 min. Of\ncourse, these preliminary experiments with a complex fluid needs further investigation,\nin which the quantity of imprinted beads would be optimised to obtain an almost\ncomplete depletion of HSA from serum.\nIn conclusion, the results presented here, demonstrate the efficiency of the\nimmobilisation approach for generating a surface able to recognize a specific protein\ntarget in simple and complex samples. This approach, in the future, may have great\npotential applications, in biomaterials for recognition of proteins, in sensing and in\nproteome applications.\n16\nReferences\nAhmed, N., Barker, G., Oliva, K., Garfin, D., Rice G., 2003.
