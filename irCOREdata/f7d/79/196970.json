Conceiving of the visual \nas a significant force in the production and dissemination of collective memory, we argue that a new \ngenre of World War Two films has recently emerged that form part of a new discursive \u201eregime of \nmemory\u201f about the war and those that fought and lived through it, constituting a commemoration as \nmuch about reflecting on the present as it is about remembering the past. In particular we consider \nthree explicit mediated memories that contribute to this project. First, we argue that these films seek to \nreaffirm a (particular conception of a) US national identity and military patriotism in the post-Cold \nWar era by importing World War Two as the key meta-narrative of America\u201fs relationship to war in \norder to \u201ecorrect\u201f and help \u201eerase\u201f Vietnam\u201fs more negative discursive rendering. Second, we argue \nthat these films attempt to rewrite the history of World War Two by elevating and illuminating the \nrole of the US at the expense of the Allies, further serving to reaffirm America\u201fs position of political \nand military dominance in the current age.  And third, that these films form part of a celebration of the \ngeneration that fought World War Two that may accord them a position of nostalgic and sentimental \ngreatness, as their collective spirit and notions of duty and service shines against the foil of what \nmight frequently be seen as our own present moral ambivalence.  \n \nKeywords: Collective memory; film; mediated representation; regime of memory; World War Two.\n 3 \nIntroduction \n[W]hen you see these films, you find out what you have to remember (Foucault 1974\/1996: 124). \n \nIn recent issues of Consumption, Markets and Culture a discussion has begun to emerge \nthat turns around issues of visual consumption in the context of war and the military. \nThuc-Doan Nguyen and Russell Belk (2007) considered some of the ways in which \nvisual representations are consumed in the production and perpetuation of collective, or \nshared, memories. Drawing on the work of Halbwachs (1980), Schroeder (1998) and \nWertsch (2002) they explore the web postings of war photographs by Vietnam veterans \nand raise questions about how these images have been used, by the veterans, as a means \nof engaging with their own sense of collective memory as veterans of that war. More \nrecently, Ann Kaplan (2008) has explored interpretive strategies and experiences in \nrelation to consuming visual images of catastrophe, with many of her examples \nemploying images of war and war-related events, whilst Lilie Chouliariki (see \nparticularly 2006; 2008) has examined the ways in which our ethical sensibility is \nshaped through our mediated spectation of suffering, particularly that enabled and \nencouraged by television news.  \n \n The purpose of this paper is to contribute to this on-going discussion by revisiting \nthe theme of collective memory, but this time, in relation to films. Specifically, we are \ninterested in thinking through some of the ways in which a corpus of war films that \nwere released during the period 1998-2006 may potentially have come to inform wider \nunderstandings and ways of remembering the events that they re-present. In following \nNguyen and Belk we recognise the significance and power of film as a form of visual \nrepresentation in the construction of memory and attend to this medium in situating our \ndiscussion.  \n \n 4 \n To this end, we find Hollywood\u201fs recent remembrance of World War Two \n(which, in itself, needs to be read intertextually against the backdrop of Vietnam: as \nwar, discourse, and visual image) of particular relevance and interest. Starting with \nSaving Private Ryan in 1998 we have seen a continual stream of World War Two films \nbeing released through the Hollywood studio system\n1\n. The internal consistency of the \nnarrative and cinematic structures on which these films have been built, and their \ndifference from those war films that preceded them, suggest to us a new genre of the \nwar film. We propose that this collection of films constitutes a key part of what we call \na new \u201cregime of memory\u201d (appropriated from Foucault\u201fs notion of a regime of truth) \nof World War Two.  \n \n Two important points of clarification need to be made at this point. First, our \nchoice of the phrase \u201eregime of memory\u201f and its direct borrowing from Foucault\u201fs \n(1980) notion of a \u201eregime of truth\u201f is highly significant. As is the case for Foucault in \nrelation to discursive truth, for us, discursive memory is not to be conceived of as some \nkind of universalising fact or reality but is, instead, best understood as:  \n\u201ca system of ordered procedures for the production, regulation, distribution, circulation and \noperation of statements. [As such memory is] linked in a circular relation with systems of power \nwhich produce and sustain it, and to effects of power which it induces and which extend it\u201d (1980: \n133). \n \n In the context of this paper, then, it does not matter whether Hollywood\u201fs memory \nof World War Two is true or false, accurate or misleading, but rather what matters is the \nregime of memory that is being disseminated through these texts. What are these texts \nsaying about the war, the military and the military subject at this time? Why? Whose \nvoices are being heard?  For what purposes? \n \n 5 \n The second point we wish to clarify is that what is offered here is just one reading \nof these texts. We do not wish to suggest that it is the only way to read them. We are \nfully receptive to the argument that there is always a multiplicity of meanings to be \nfound in any text. Indeed, it might be suggested that all interpretations of a (film) text \nare purely subjective to the point, perhaps, where each of us can take a completely \ndifferent meaning from the film every time we view it. Whilst theoretically this may be \nthe case, in practice, we would argue it is usually fairly easy to skim off at least some of \nthe more obvious and intended meanings offered by the text, without necessarily being \nforced into accepting that particular meaning. What we suggest in this paper is that \nwithin this corpus of films there is a recurring set of themes, floating not too far beneath \nthe surface, that constitute the \u201eregime of memory\u201f we are suggesting. In simple terms, \nit seems to us that there is a fairly clear narrative trend running through these films and \nit is our aim to offer one reading of these themes and how they might conceivably be \nproductive in the constitution of a particular set of discursive acts of remembrance. To \necho Kaplan (2008), ours is just one reading, but we do claim (with evidence), that the \nreading we take is one that recurs frequently. \n \n In order to develop our argument conceptually, we draw on the work of Maurice \nHalbwachs whose theory of \u201ccollective memory\u201d (1925\/1992) continues to inform \nmany contemporary debates on social remembrance (see Misztal 2003; Storey 2003; \nMiddleton and Brown 2005). A number of key themes contained within his writings are \noutlined and are used as a platform from which to launch our own inquiries into the \nsubject area. Building on Halbwachs, we also consider Foucault\u201fs contribution to \ndiscussions of memory. Although not a major component of his work, his ideas in this \narea have been extremely influential with certain groups (see, for example, the work of \nthe Popular Memory Group, 1982). And, in order to highlight the contributing role of \n 6 \nfilm in frameworks of social remembrance, we also introduce a number of Baudrillard\u201fs \nthoughts on the relationship between history and the media, as discussed in The Illusion \nof the End (1994). Having laid out this conceptual basis we then unpack, in more detail, \nthe broader interest in war remembrance that appears to circulate in contemporary \nsociety.  \n \n Following this, we very briefly situate our discussion of the corpus of films under \nconsideration by locating them within the wider war film genre. Specifically, we offer a \nbrief overview of what we consider to be the dominant genre of war representation in \nAmerican film-making prior to the inception of these texts: namely the Vietnam War \ngenre of the 1970s and 1980s. Given the intertextual connections between these two sets \nof films this is a necessary first move to make. \n \n Having established these conceptual parameters, we finally move to consider a \nnumber of \u201emediated\u201f memories that emerge in the recent retellings of World War Two. \nWorking primarily, but not exclusively, through a close reading of Steven Spielberg\u201fs \nSaving Private Ryan (1998), we explore three specific facets of the new regime of \nmemory we see as partially instantiated through filmic re-imaginings of World War \nTwo. First, we suggest this genre of films constructs a discourse in which World War \nTwo can be remembered as the \u201egood\u201f war; morally justified and politically \nunambiguous. Second, that these films present an imagery that emphasises American \ntriumphalism and victory in World War Two. Rather than \u201edepicting\u201f history, they \nattempt to \u201erewrite\u201f it: to borrow Jameson\u201fs (1998) phrase, they are \u201chistoricist\u201d rather \nthan \u201chistorical\u201d. Third, we propose that these films, in their representation of the \nsoldiers who fought in the war, evoke a memory of sacrifice. A sacrifice endured so that \nfuture generations could live in (a particular conception of) freedom. In remembering \n 7 \nthis sacrifice, the films also pass a moral judgement on modern moral ambivalence, \nindividualism and consumptive greed and excess. In this way the texts go far beyond the \nnostalgic commemoration for a generation whose time is coming to an end, and act as a \ncipher for present-day ideology.  \n \n The choice of Saving Private Ryan as the primary text for this paper is not \ncoincidental. The film is significant for a number of reasons. First, released in 1998, it \nwas, arguably, the film that kick-started and revived interest in presenting war on \nscreen.\n2\n Its positive, patriotic narrative also established a template that numerous films \nwould follow. As Victor Canby (last accessed 15\/07\/2006) notes, Spielberg probably \nhad not planned to \u201crestore the [American] nation\u201fs heroic image of itself\u201d when \nmaking Saving Private Ryan but seemingly that is the project that he instigated.  \n \n Second, part of the discursive power of Saving Private Ryan stems from the \nmeans by which Spielberg hides much of his subtle revisionism behind the mask of \nspectacular filmmaking. Here we refer to the infamous \u201efirst 24 minutes\u201f, a discussion \nof which no review of the film could be without. The horror and brutality of war \ndepicted in Spielberg\u201fs construction of the D-Day landings stamps the film, it seems, \nwith a seal of authenticity, of realism. Many of the survivors of that day, who are still \nalive, applauded Spielberg\u201fs representation as such. Moreover, his use of handheld \ncameras and 35-millimetre film gives a documentary effect to the imagery, reminiscent \nof Frank Capra\u201fs original footage of that day, and a technique that has become \ncommonplace in subsequent retellings of World War Two. So powerful were the \nscenes, and the overall representation, that the American Legion created a \u201cSpirit of \nNormandy\u201d award for Spielberg, and the U.S. Army awarded him its highest civilian \ndecoration (Cohen 1998: 84) \n 8 \n \n In reading the films in this way, it is our contention that these visual images are \nnot without discursive effects. Indeed, when these three memories (amongst others that \nare not discussed) are read across this corpus of films and then, more broadly, across the \nwealth of World War Two \u201evehicles of remembrance\u201f currently circulating, they \nconstruct, we would argue, a particular history of World War Two: one in which certain \nmemories become dominant, in which certain ways of remembering become dominant. \nThey constitute, for us, a new regime of memory on World War Two.  \n \nTheorising collective memory \n[M]emory [is] not merely a faculty with which individuals are endowed \u2013 that is a property or \nthing \u2026 - but also an activity \u2013 a set of social techniques or procedures (Middleton and Brown \n2005: 20). \n \nThe idea of memory as a social process owes much to the work of Maurice Halbwachs \nwho, in his On Collective Memory (1925\/1992), outlines a social framework of memory \nwhose main principles still influence many current debates in the field of memory \nstudies. It is worth briefly considering each of those here. \n \n Halbwachs\u201f first claim is that memories are as much collective as they are \nindividual: \u201cthere exists a collective memory and social frameworks for memory; it is to \nthe degree that our individual thought places itself in these frameworks and participates \nin this memory that it is capable of the act of recollection\u201d (1925\/1992: 38). \n \n In many ways, this notion is seen as Halbwachs\u201f most significant contribution to \nthe field of memory studies (Misztal 2003). On one level he is arguing that memory is \nalways socially framed because, however defined, it is the group (the family, the nation) \nthat determines what is to be remembered. However, on another level, what he is also \n 9 \nsuggesting is that our individual memories cannot be untied from our discursive \npositioning within the group. By extension, as our positioning within groups shifts, so \nour memories will be informed by such moves: \u201cmy memories change \u201eas my position \nchanges\u201f and \u201ethis position itself changes as my relationships to other milieux change\u201f\u201d \n(Halbwachs 1926\/1950: 48 cited in Misztal 2003: 51). \n \n Importantly, whilst Halbwachs\u201f attention was normally drawn toward the local \nlevel, that is, he was most interested in how small intimate groups such as the family \nremember, he also suggests that collective memory operates on a larger (societal) level. \nMisztal (2003) summaries the argument thus: \nAlthough he is aware that \u201eOrdinarily, the nation is too remote from the individual for him to \nconsider the history of his country as anything else than a very large framework with which his \nown history makes contact at only few points\u201f, he argues that there are certain events that \u201ealter \ngroup life\u201f and therefore that collective memory can play a solidifying role in societies. So, despite \nthe fact that \u201ebetween individual and nation lie many other, more restricted groups\u201f, each with its \nown history, there is the possibility of a link between collective memory and social solidarity on a \nnational scale (p. 52). \n \n Conceiving of memory in this way creates the conditions of possibility for \nthinking about memory as discursively produced and therefore the subject of \npower\/knowledge regimes. As Gross (2000) has noted: \u201cOf the nearly infinite number \nof things any collectivity could designate as memorable, comparatively few are actually \nretained and made accessible as social knowledge\u201d (p. 77): What is remembered and \nwhy become important points of inquiry.  \n \n Consideration of the operation (and manipulation) of memory in this way marks \nFoucault\u201fs point of entry into the debate. Foucault (1974\/1996), in situating a tension \nbetween dominant and resistant memories, employs the term \u201cpopular memory\u201d to \ndescribe those methods by which resistant or \u201ccounter-memory\u201d emerges as a force \nagainst dominant representations of the past. Counter-memories are the memories of the \n 10 \nmarginalised, the repressed, the unheard: \u201cThis popular history was, to a certain extent, \neven more alive, more clearly formulated in the 19\nth\n century, where, for instance, there \nwas a whole tradition of struggles which were transmitted orally, or in writing or songs, \netc\u201d (Foucault 1974\/1996: 123). \n \n Foucault argues that memory-formation can be conceived of as a \u201ediscursive \npractice\u201f (Misztal 2003: 62) and as such becomes: \u201ca very important factor in struggle \n(really, in fact, struggles develop in a kind of conscious moving forward of history), if \none controls people\u201fs memory, one controls their dynamism\u201d (Foucault 1974\/1996: \n124). When read in the wider context of his work on power\/knowledge, memory \nbecomes another discursive tool through which dominant and resistant truths engage.  \n \n Interestingly, Foucault notes the emergence of film as an important site in the \nbattle over memory: \u201cToday, cheap books aren\u201ft enough. There are much more \neffective means like television and the cinema. And I believe this was one way of \nreprogramming popular memory, which existed but had no way of expressing itself\u201d \n(Ibid. p. 123). \n \n Foucault's theory of popular memory has been influential. In invoking the Popular \nMemory Group\n3\n, (much of whose work was built on Foucauldian foundations), \nAshplant et al. (2000) suggest that the relationship between individual and collective \nmemory is one of a: \u201chegemonic relationship process of ideological domination and \nresistance\u201d (p. 13). Individual memories, they suggest, cannot in themselves be \nseparated, or unscrambled from, wider dominant historical discourses. Such discourses \nprovide the context through which individual memories come to be understood. \nHowever, importantly, at the same time, dominant collective memories can only be \n 11 \nsustained if they in some way connect with, or relate to, individual memories: \u201cOnly if \nit continues to engage with individual memories does cultural memory retain its \npolitical effectiveness, while personal memories are in part shaped by pre-existing \nnational and local cultural memories\u201d (Ibid. p. 18). \n \n In recognising this complex and shifting relation, Halbwachs\u201f second component \nof collective memory asserts that remembrance is always an active process of \n(re)construction and (re)presentation. That is to say, in acts of remembrance we do not \nretain and retrieve pure, unadulterated memories of past events but rather they have to \nbe reconstructed by our (shifting) selves in order to be retold. In part the way in which \nwe perform this act or reconstruction is determined by our group affiliations and our \ndiscursive positioning but Halbwachs suggests other significant factors are also \nimportant. Perhaps the most obvious being time itself.  \n \n Most of our memories are affected by time: \u201c[A]t different periods of our lives, \nthey [memories] have lost the form and the appearance they once had\u201d (Halbwachs \n1925\/1992: 47). Difficult, painful memories may soften, or be reworked, or \nrecontextualised to make them more bearable. Memories of happy times may be further \nexaggerated, or placed in relationship to our current situation, or circumstances. In this \nway, memories cannot be seen as fixed or static but are fluid; continually changing and \ndeveloping. They are also, by extension, open to manipulation or, as Foucault \n(1974\/1996) terms it, \u201creprogramming\u201d.  \n \n Third, according to Halbwachs, memory is always \u201epresent-situated\u201f (Storey \n2003: 103). Halbwachs remarks that \u201cthe past does not recur as such \u2026 everything \nseems to indicate that the past is not preserved but is reconstructed on the basis of the \n 12 \npresent\u201d (Halbwachs 1925\/1992: 40). This is a significant point; the present becomes \nthe fulcrum upon which understandings and definitions of the past turn. When \nconsidered in this way certain questions emerge: for what reason is the past being \nreconstructed in the present? What particular version of the past is being told? Who is \ntelling the story, and why? Such questions, in relation to Hollywood\u201fs recent turn to \nWorld War Two, are what drive this paper forward.\n \n \n Fourth, and relatedly, Halbwachs claims that collective memories are embodied in \n\u201cmnemonic artefacts\u201d (Storey 2003: 104). In other words, collective memories cannot \nbe sustained purely through verbal communication but must also take some material \nform. For Halbwachs, writing in the first quarter of the twentieth century, this meant \nartefacts such as shrines, war memorials, statues, and so on. Today, arguably, it is the \nmass media that undertake a primary role in this regard.  \n \n Of course, the notion that memories can emerge out of mediated representations is \nnot new. However, in following Baudrillard (1994), it might be said that their \n(re)productions through such  means have intensified under the conditions of global \nmedia and communications technology: \u201chistory cannot now be separated from its \nmodel, its simulation\u201d (p. 6). Our relationship to pasts, presents and possible futures, \nmay now be most fittingly considered as a mediated one. In this regard, Schudson refers \nto the media, and all tools of collective memory as \u201ecultural vehicles\u201f of remembrance \n(1992: 20). Such vehicles transport the past across time and space and deliver it into \nprojects of the present.  \n \n To summarise: we would suggest that through a complex weaving together of \nindividual and collective memory, motivated by the technologies of the mass media, a \n 13 \nnew social framework of remembrance on World War Two is currently under \nconstruction. It is to outlining specific elements of this framework, which we will term a \n\u201cregime of memory\u201d, that the discussion now turns. \n \nTowards a new regime of memory on World War Two?  \nThe relationship between war and remembrance is as old as the act itself. Past deeds, \nheroes and battles are continually dug up, drawn upon, reinterpreted and used in a \nvariety of different spheres and contexts. What is of interest here, however, is the almost \nobsessive attention given to remembering war since the late 1990s; attention primarily \nfocused on World War Two: \u201cIt is not overstating matters to claim that for the last three \nyears we have been awash with World War II reminiscences and cultural memorabilia \nthe extent of which we haven\u201ft experienced since before the Vietnam War\u201d (Moses \n2002, last accessed on 15\/07\/2006). \n \n This attention is indexed through films, books, commemorations, re-enactments, \nand numerous digital TV channels and serial publications that almost exclusively deal \nwith representations of World War Two; as well as web-based communication, TV \ndramas and a whole new genre of video games. Such attention has caught the eye of \nscholarly writers too, with a wealth of publications stemming from a variety of \nacademic disciplines including History, Sociology and Media Studies (cf. Ashplant et \nal., 2000 and Evans and Lunn, 1997). \n \n As a collection of popular cultural artefacts many of these texts wallow in a \nsentimentalised nostalgia for a time when it seemed that people had a purpose, a fight \nworth fighting and the moral righteousness to see it through; a time when the whole \nnation rallied together in the \u201ewar-effort.\u201f In reading such texts it is difficult not to be \n 14 \ncharmed and touched by the oral testimonies and the attitudes and behaviours of those \nwho lived through these events. The concern here, however, is with what lies behind \nthis widespread phenomenon of remembrance and commemoration. Why is it that a \nparticular regime of memory of World War Two is under construction at this time? \nAshplant et al., in the introduction to their edited collection The Politics of War Memory \nand Commemoration (2000) offer several reasons: \nFirst, its most powerful, transnational manifestation has been the emergence into public visibility \nof the Shoah, through a variety of projects ranging from the establishment of new museums and \nthe production of documentary and fictional films, to the campaigns to trace and bring to justice \nNazi war criminals, and to restore the so-called \u201eNazi gold\u201f and other stolen property to the Jewish \nvictims and their families (p. 3). \n \n Fascination with the Holocaust has ignited such attention that Norman Finkelstein \n(2000) has coined the term \u201cThe Holocaust Industry\u201d to describe the phenomenon. \nBooks and testimonies have packed shelves, and filled many slots on the various \ndocumentary channels on TV. The Holocaust has been re-introduced into the cinema via \nSteven Spielberg\u201fs powerful Schindler\u2019s List (1993) and Roman Polanski\u201fs The Pianist \n(2002), amongst others. Former concentration camps are now open to the public as, \nwhat might conceivably be termed, \u201etourist attractions\u201f. The Imperial War Museum in \nLondon has a permanent Holocaust exhibition.  \n \n A second feature of this interest in war and memory that Ashplant et al. recognise \nis the increasing demand made by individuals, families, activist groups and legal entities \nfor recognition of trauma suffered directly, or indirectly, through war. Most recently this \nhas taken place with reference to conditions such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder \n(PTSD). The need to talk about \u201esurvivors\u201f and \u201evictims\u201f and the increasing number of \nlegal cases filing for some kind of compensation, functioning as part of a wider \nlitigation culture, helps keep war in the public, and media eye. Interestingly, conditions \nsuch as PTSD now even extend to non-combatants, such as aid workers and even, it \n 15 \nseems, news reporters and war correspondents. To this can be added Kaplan\u201fs (2008) \nnotion of an equally pervasive \u201ctrauma culture\u201d which emerges largely through what \nshe sees as the almost obsessive media reporting of catastrophe. \n \n Third, and functioning as part of a wider commemoration boom, which is, in \nitself, a significant element of the recent turn to memory, is the increasing number and \nmediation of anniversaries and commemorations of World War Two. The 60\nth\n \nanniversary commemorations of the D-Day landings held in 2004 were significant not \njust in their size and scale, nor just for the wealth of commemorative newspapers and \nmagazines, TV programmes and films released, but also in the way in which they were \nused to further prevailing political concerns: a notable example being the attendance of \nGerhard Schroeder; the first German Chancellor to attend such commemorations.  \n \n A significant event, not just because it demonstrates the place of Germany in the \ncurrent world order, and the forgiveness implied in Germany\u201fs invitation, but also for \nthe way Schroeder used the event to thank the Allies for beginning the process, on the \nbeaches of Normandy, of freeing his homeland from the tyranny of Nazism. Careful not \nto diminish the sacrifice of ordinary German soldiers, Schroeder set out to renegotiate \nhis country\u201fs relationship to its past, to create a new memory, by suggesting that \nGermany had been \u201eenslaved\u201f by Nazism and that the Allies had set it free. The \noccasion also served as a platform for George Bush, in honouring the fallen, to \ngalvanise support for current war efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. More recently, the \n60\nth\n anniversary commemorations of VJ day were again used as a means of bringing up \nthe past into projects of the present when George Bush compared the situation in Iraq to \nWorld War Two by contextualising both as a struggle for freedom. As David Morris \n(2007: 96) has observed: \u201cThe darker the news from Iraq gets, the more we need our \n 16 \nsanitized view of World War II to make us feel better about ourselves.\u201d Whilst most of \nthe films under consideration here were released, or under production, prior to the \nattacks of 9\/11 and the subsequent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan it is certainly not \nunreasonable to suggest that their reception may well have been influenced by these \nevents. \n \nFinally, Ashplant et al. suggest: \n[P]ublic concern with the memory of war has been stimulated by the collapse of the Soviet Union \nand the so-called \u201eEastern bloc\u201f in Europe (1989-91), the consequent ending of the Cold War and \nthe realignment of power relations in what were once polarized spheres of influence throughout \nthe world (2000: 5). \n \n In the post-Cold War era we are, arguably, witnessing a new type of warfare, \npossibly a \u201epostmodern\u201f warfare (see Hables Gray 1997), which we are struggling to \nappropriately apprehend. At a time of such uncertainty, a turn to \u201ethe\u201f war with clear \npolitical objectives and a just cause is far easier to negotiate, especially in the shadow of \nVietnam (as war, discourse and image). To this relationship we now turn. \n \nSituating the war film genre: the legacy of Vietnam  \nIn considering the films produced during the 1998-2006 period it is important that they \nbe read against the backdrop of Vietnam. The Vietnam War, and its representation, have \nhad a significant effect on both the military actions of the United States and on the way \nin which war, the military and the military subject have come to be depicted in film ever \nsince. As such, the current genre is inseparably connected, intertexually, with Vietnam.  \n \n Anthony Easthope (1988) argues that the World War Two film genre that \nemerged in the 1940s (and continued to dominate filmic representations of war \nthroughout the 1950s, 1960s and well into the 1970s) was distinguished by four key \n 17 \nnarrative themes: enemy, leadership, fraternity and victory. The enemy were always the, \noften inhuman, other. Allied leadership was always trustworthy and dependable. There \nwas a strong sense of unity and fraternity amongst the key protagonists, often emerging \nas the characters were transformed from civilians into, if you like, a \u201eband of brothers\u201f. \nFinally, the mission was always successfully completed and victory achieved. For \nEasthope, these four features worked together to form a unifying narrative structure on \nwhich many World War Two films were based. \n \n By the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, however, World War Two was \nreplaced as the dominant paradigm of war representation by films depicting the \nVietnam War. In the filmic representation of this war, the above-mentioned narrative \nstructure was called into question, perhaps even turned on its head. Instead, a more \ncritical narrative emerged (cf. Easthope 1988, Walsh and Louvre 1988).  \n \n During the Vietnam War itself, which lasted over ten years, only one film, \ndepicting the war, was made; The Green Berets (1968). This film, structured in the \npatriotic and positive mould of the World War Two genre outlined above, sees John \nWayne in the role of a tough Marine Sergeant leading a group of new recruits through a \n\u201etour\u201f of Vietnam. However, the film was heavily criticised at the time for presenting \nsomething of a propagandist treatment of the war, or as Tim Dirks describes it: \u201ca \nshamelessly jingoistic, heavy-handed, ... ultra-patriotic, anti-Communist ... gung-ho \naction film\u201d (Last accessed on 27\/11\/2007). Roger Ebert, in his review of the film, \nnoted that: \nIt is not a simple war. We all know it is not simple. Perhaps we could have believed this film in \n1962 or 1963, when most of us didn't much care what was happening in Vietnam. But we cannot \nbelieve it today. Not after television has brought the reality of the war to us. Not after the Fulbright \nhearings and the congressional debates and the primaries. Not after 23,000 Americans have been \nkilled (Last accessed on 03\/10\/2007). \n \n 18 \n It was not until the end of the 1970s that Vietnam became a suitable topic for \nfilmic representations. The reasons for such a delay are subject to debate. Walsh and \nLouvre (1988) speculate on a number of causes: \u201cguilt, despair, television overkill, the \nneed for a period of mourning and contemplation, wounds inflicted upon the national \npsyche\u201d (pp. 5-6). Whatever the reasoning, the release of four films in 1978 (Boys in \nCompany C, Go Tell the Spartans, The Deer Hunter, and Coming Home) signalled the \ninauguration of a new genre of war representation, marking \u201ca radical shift in the ways \nin which [war] ... and its soldiers have been represented and narrated\u201d (Jeffords 1989: \n170). \n \n When read collectively, Vietnam films seem to lack coherence and unity in their \nvision. Frequently parodying the war, they are full of contradictions, ambiguities and \nconflicting concerns. Films in this genre range from those that deal with the psychosis \nof the war (see Apocalypse Now, 1979) through those that address the issue of \nAmerican-instigated atrocities (see Casualties of War, 1989) to those that critically \nreflect on the failure of (American) bureaucratic control (see Rambo: First Blood Part \n2, 1985), and those that focus on the hostility encountered by many returning veterans \n(see Born on the Fourth of July, 1989).  \n \n Despite these differences they do at least agree on one thematic trope: \u201ca vision of \nthe war as a problem within American culture\u201d (Desser 1991: 81). For Alasdair Spark, \nVietnam was a profusion of wars: \u201c[A]n imperialist war fought by a superpower against \nan underdeveloped country, a war of revolution, a civil war, a war for national \nreunification, a guerrilla war and a media war\u201d (cited in Walsh and Louvre 1988: 1). \nUncertain feelings about this war were so widespread that, for the ordinary American \npeople, the war became shrouded in a sense of confusion. Such a feeling was felt \n 19 \nespecially keenly given the backdrop of World War Two, against which the Vietnam \nWar was continuously measured. When considered in this sense, the Vietnam War \ncould not easily be translated into film, certainly not in the template that had come to \ndominate representations of earlier conflicts, as revisitation of Easthope\u201fs four themes \nof the World War Two genre reveals. \n \nEnemy \nThe notion of the enemy is a deeply problematic one in this genre. Across the range of \nVietnam films, numerous groups and individuals have been labelled as \u201ethe other\u201f, \u201ethe \nenemy\u201f. First, and most obviously, there is the Vietnamese enemy, but also within this \ncorpus of films there seem to be numerous \u201einternal\u201f enemies, such as (the bureaucracy \nof) the American government, the American public, even American soldiers themselves.  \n \nLeadership  \nWhereas World War Two films regularly celebrated and commemorated the leaders of \nthe war, both factual and fictional, what distinguishes Vietnam films is their often-\nnegative representation of military and civilian leadership.  \n \n To take first the civilian leaders, numerous Vietnam films made during the 1980s \ncentre on what Storey (2003) calls the \u201cwar of betrayal\u201d. The narratives in films such as \nMissing in Action 2 (1984) and Rambo: First Blood Part 2 (1985) centre on the failure \nof government agencies to fully support the soldiers on the ground during the war, and \non the subsequent abandonment of prisoners of war in its aftermath. The narrative is \ninvariably one in which the lone \u201ewarrior\u201f then corrects such actions. \n \n In other films it is military authority that is called into question and scrutinised. In \n 20 \nPlatoon, for example, the inexperienced Lieutenant Wolfe is frequently undermined, \nignored and ridiculed by those under him. In Good Morning Vietnam (1987) Lieutenant \nHauk is presented as inept, incompetent and rigidly steadfast in his adherence to \nmilitary protocol and discipline. \n \nFraternity \nIn Vietnam films, as Powers et al. (1996) note: \nThe sense of community or fraternity, once a prominent feature of the military movie, barely \nsurvives, or if it does, becomes a source of sadism and evil. No better example can be found in our \nsample of the complete breakdown of loyalty and trust among soldiers than Barnes\u201f murder of \nElias in Platoon (pp. 95-6). \n \n Whilst many World War Two films involved narratives in which the \u201eband of \nbrothers\u201f breaks down or comes into conflict with one another, another significant trope \nwas the way such differences and tensions could then be put aside whilst all of the men \ncome together to accomplish their task. Indeed as Dittmar and Michaud (1990) note, \nfrequently the whole purpose of dissension within the group was precisely to show that \n\u201conly by working together could Americans hope to defeat their common enemies\u201d (p. \n5). \n \n In Vietnam, however, such coming together seems impossible. Divisions between \nindividuals and groups are too great and deep to be reconciled. Numerous films pursue \nthese themes to extreme levels. For example, in Platoon, it is indexed through Barnes\u201f \nattempted murder of Elias, for which Taylor then murders Barnes. In Casualties of War, \nEricsson\u201fs decision to \u201efrag\u201f on his platoon after they kidnap, rape and kill a young \nVietnamese girl results in numerous attempts made on his life by members of his unit. \n \nVictory  \nThe issue of victory is one of the most ambiguous within Vietnam films. The war itself \n 21 \nnever officially ended. There was no clear declaration of victory or defeat. Few of the \nfilms within this genre consider the ending of the war. Most often, the films begin and \nend in the midst of the conflict. As such, many of these films \u201eend\u201f instead with some \nreflection on the cost of the war, the failures, and the losses. In many ways: \n[T]his is a discourse in which there is nothing to explain but American survival. Getting \u201eBack to \nthe World\u201f is everything it is about. It is an American tragedy and America and Americans are its \nonly victims. The myth is expressed with numbing precision in Chris Taylor\u201fs narration at the end \nof Platoon (Storey 2003: 110-11). \n \nTaylor: I think now, looking back, we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves. And the enemy \n\u2026 was in us. The war is over for me now but it will always be there, the rest of my days, as I\u2019m \nsure Elias will be, fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called possession of my soul. There are \ntimes since I\u2019ve felt like the child born of those two fathers. But be that as it may, those of us who \ndid make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know, and to try with \nwhat\u2019s left of our lives to find a goodness, and meaning, to this life. \n \n Having situated the corpus of films under consideration within the wider war film \ngenre, we now move to undertake our detailed analysis of the films and the mediated \nmemories we see emerging within their cinematic reimagining of World War Two\n4\n. \n \nThe Good War, restoring national identity and erasing Vietnam\n \nPerhaps the boldest act that these films attempt in their remembrance is to \u201ere-imagine\u201f \nUS national identity, or at least a version of it (albeit one subject to challenge, resistance \nand struggle). Furthermore, and in doing so, we would argue, they seek to engage with, \napologise for, erase, rewrite and\/or eclipse the mediated memories of the Vietnam War.  \n \n The specific choice of World War Two as the narrative template on which to re-\nimage\/imagine America can be explained in a number of ways. First, in relation to the \nend of the Cold War, Moses (2002) suggests that the post-Cold War period has left \nfilmmakers in something of an historical lull. The Cold War had provided a clear \nnarrative template for structuring war films. However, the subsequent collapse of the \nSoviet Union, the Warsaw Pact and the disassembling of the Eastern bloc created a \n 22 \nvacuum in the arsenal of the action and war film producer. Efforts not to \u201ecelebrate\u201f the \nvictory over the Soviet Union, recognising the political and commercial dangers in \ndoing so, made it difficult to continue demonising the East in order to celebrate the \nWest.  \n \n Second, since the end of World War Two no conflict has inspired the nation to \nrally together in anything like the same way. Perhaps the most significant conflict \nduring the 1990s (for the US) was the first Gulf War and whilst this served as a \nplatform on which President Bush Sr. could proclaim an end to the \u201eVietnam \nSyndrome\u201f the quick defeat and the carefully managed mediation of the war left few \nmemorable images except for the images themselves. The Gulf War did not warrant \nexcessive celebration, particularly when considering that Saddam Hussein was left in \npower at the end of the conflict and the disastrous consequences of Bush\u201fs calling to \narms of the Iraqi Shiites and then their subsequent abandonment and slaughter. This was \na celebration of technology and of television war. Equally, the conflict in the former \nYugoslavia has not received a great deal of filmic attention, perhaps because of the \nambiguity of the role of the UN in this conflict and for the lack of clear political \nalliances and notions of \u201evictory\u201f. Seemingly then, since the end of the Cold War no \nconflict has stood up to the demands of capturing the sustained attention and interest of \nthe film industry. In order to celebrate and restore a sense of nationhood and military \nprowess, Hollywood has turned to the good war, the war with clear distinctions between \ngoodies and baddies, between evil dictators and world saviours, to a victory that was \nclear and without (at least in its re-presentation) moral ambiguity. By focusing attention \non the \u201egood war\u201f, it is possible to encourage a sense of national pride and patriotic zeal \nin a nation still shrouded under the veil of Vietnam.\n5\n A detailed discussion of Saving \nPrivate Ryan will help illuminate this position. \n 23 \n \n Notwithstanding specific scenes, Saving Private Ryan exudes a patriotic fervour \nand basks in American symbolism. From the opening and closing shots which exhibit a \nclose-up of the stars and stripes, to the depiction of the home front (see below), to the \ngeneral nobility and courage of the average American soldier, Saving Private Ryan is a \nfilm to be proud of for American audiences because it shows \u201eordinary\u201f Americans \ndoing extraordinary things in the most difficult of circumstances. There is little negative \nimagery that cannot be justified or excused. Even the images of US soldiers shooting \nsurrendering Germans is portrayed in a way that suggests they are experiencing more a \nkind of temporary war shock or trauma (of the kind that now functions to serve legal \nclaims for compensation) than any homicidal tendency. This scene also features as an \nisolated incident, suggesting that it was not a common practice amongst American \nsoldiers, but resulted from an explosion of emotion at having experienced the madness \nand brutality of the beach landings that day. Such narrative ploys can be read as a \nreaction against the almost gleeful massacre of enemy forces and civilians depicted in \nmany Vietnam films.  \n \n There is also an expansive dedication to American sources within the film, from \nAbraham Lincoln, to Emerson, and, as Auster (2002) notes: \n\u2026 Spielberg and screenwriter Robert Rodat go a step further, invoking the worldwide \nconsciousness of American popular culture even among denizens of the master race. Thus, a \nterrified German soldier captured by the squad tries to curry favour by hysterically parading his \nknowledge of Betty Boo, Betty Grable (\u201cNice gams\u201d), and, in a last desperate attempt to save his \nlife, finally blurts out the ultimate in American obscenities, \u201cFuck Hitler!\u201d (Last accessed on \n07\/08\/2006). \n \n Beyond this, there are certain scenes that stand out particularly and are worth \nexploring for the narrative and cinematographic tactics they employ in re-imagining \nAmerica. The first we wish to consider is what shall be referred to as the \u201eBixby Letter\u201f \nscene. \n 24 \n \n This scene, which follows the Omaha beach landings, sets the context for the film \nand reveals the reason why there is a need to save a certain Private Ryan. The scene \nopens in a US war office, full of female typists, (one of the few appearances of women \nin the film) preparing telegrams that tell of fallen soldiers. The room is awash with a \nradiant sunlight that penetrates the room and fills it with a soft glow; a warming contrast \nagainst the bitter cold and greyness of the beach landings. The mournful score is \nreplaced with a more uplifting string arrangement. As the anonymous voiceovers read \nout the telegrams of the dead, merging and over-lapping to signify the sheer numerical \nwealth, one typist notices a correlation between names and then discovers that three \nbrothers by the name of Ryan have all been killed in the space of one week, and that the \nmother of these three will receive all of the telegrams together.  \n \n To reinforce what we can only imagine will be the response of Mrs. Ryan upon \nreceiving this most unwanted of mail, Spielberg cuts to a scene of the telegrams \narriving, with Mrs Ryan otherwise going about her ordinary, everyday chores. No \ndialogue is heard but we feel her pain as she crumbles to the floor in response to the \nnews.  \n \n What is interesting here is less the narrative, but the composition of the scene, an \nopportunity for Spielberg to gorge himself on an excess of American imagery and \nsymbolism. The choice of setting - a single farmhouse surrounded by cornfields, bathed \nin a golden autumn light, somewhere in the mid West - exudes a nostalgic vision of \nAmerica. Mrs Ryan herself is a kindly, gentle-looking woman, with rosy cheeks, well-\ngroomed hair, wearing a summer dress; a motherly figure if ever there was one. As one \nfilm reviewer noted, this scene \u201csymbolises all that is \u201etrue\u201f and good about America \u2013 \n 25 \nit is earthly, honest, hard-working and God-fearing, the heartland of the USA\u201d (Anon. \ncited in Plato\u201fs Cave, last accessed on 08\/06\/2006). This clich\u00e9d imagery sets forth a \nclear context in which to view Spielberg\u201fs vision of the past. It is a pastiche; it is \nsomehow false, too good, and too real to be true. As Jameson (1998) notes: \nIn such films the very style of a period is the content and they substitute a fashion-plate of the age \nin question for its events, thus producing a kind of generational periodization of a stereotypical \nkind which is not without its impact on their capacity to function as narratives (p. 129).  \n \n This type of periodisation is a strong feature across this genre of films. In Pearl \nHarbor it manifests itself in the play on the youth and innocence of 1940s USA; \u201ekids\u201f \ndate and share a milkshake, they go to dance halls and make-out in the back of cars. \nThere exists a moral purity and innocence that comes to typify this generation. The \nhorror and brutality of war becomes an epiphenomenon against which to situate the \nidealisation of non-war America at the time. Absent from such scenes are any negative \naspects of US society at the time, such as the general racial inequality and segregation \nthat was institutionally widespread.\n6\n  \n \n Back to the story. Concerned at the suffering caused to Mrs Ryan, a case is \nbrought before General George C. Marshall, the US Army Chief of Staff, to bring home \nthe fourth and final Ryan brother who is currently somewhere in Normandy, behind \nenemy lines. During a heated debate between a group of senior military officials on the \npractical and moralistic value of attempting such a rescue mission, Marshall draws their \nattention to a letter-of-condolence written to a Mrs Bixby, who suffered a similar loss \nwhen all five of her sons died on the field of battle. As Marshall reads the letter, one he \ncan recite from memory, it is revealed that the war in question is the American Civil \nWar, and the letter written by none other than Abraham Lincoln.  \n \n This scene is fundamental to the patriotic power of this film and of its attempts to \n 26 \nwork into a memory of an essentialist, perpetual American national identity. Invoking \none of the key events in the making of the American nation, and one of its greatest men \nof history, a figure charged with American symbolism: \u201ctakes the film out of the realm \nof mere realism and bathes it in the more luminous power of a sublime nationalism that \nhas come to be associated with Lincoln\u201d (Auster 2002, last accessed on 07\/08\/2006).  \n \n The room goes quiet; no more debate is necessary. The mission has to go ahead. \nEven the most ardent dissenter gives a stoic nod of acceptance; after all, who can argue \nwith Abe? Not only does this scene add historical weight to the mission, and to the film, \nbut as Canby (1998) notes: \nHere we have evidence that the world\u201fs most powerful country has a heart. The nation being run \nnot by scallywags and rascals, \u2026 but by towering father figures, men firm of purpose, measured in \ntheir conduct, who grieve as we grieve (Last accessed on 15\/07\/2006).\n 7\n \n \n Significantly, the scene also works to help revise one of the most publicised and \ndamaging memories of the Vietnam War, and a significant trope within its critical \nrepresentation; that of leaving men behind. By placing such importance on a single life \nthe film creates a memory of the value placed by the US Army, and presumably \ntherefore the Administration, on the lives of its soldiers. They are not just names or \nbodies or numbers but, damn it, they\u201fre our boys and if we can, as Marshall says, \u201cwe\u2019ll \nget [them] the hell out of there.\u201d  \n \n Continuing this theme, the mission to save Private Ryan also sets up one of the \nkey tensions played out in the film, namely are eight lives (the number of men in the \nplatoon sent out to find Ryan) worth one: Ryan\u201fs? Whilst Spielberg never directly \nanswers this question, it seems to us that it is implicitly answered in the positive, for by \nthe film\u201fs conclusion, Sgt. Horvath (the rescue-platoon\u201fs Sergeant) claims: \u201cSomeday \nwe might look back and decide that saving Private Ryan was the one decent thing we \n 27 \nwere able to pull out of this whole God-awful, shitty mess.\u201d Even Private Reiben, the \nmost vocal dissenter in the platoon, finally but silently acknowledges and accepts Ryan \nand, implicitly, their mission.  \n \n What seems to be happening here is that Spielberg is injecting the film with a \nmemory that establishes these men, these symbols of the greatest generation,\n8\n as true, \ngood, men. Whenever dissent or difficulty arises, it is always resolved through some \nnarrative technique that reminds us how good these men truly are - an important move \nwhen read against the shadow of Vietnam (much more will be said on this theme later \nin the paper).  \n \n To sum up this memory, what we have suggested here is that these films, of which \nSaving Private Ryan is an excellent example, imagine World War Two as the good war, \na war fought with clear moral imperatives and fought by men with courage and honour. \nYet, the films do more than simply commemorate this war. They seek to celebrate war \nand the military by employing a narrative that seeks to erase the memory and the \nrepresentation of Vietnam as the dominant template of war in American popular \nculture\n9\n. In erasing Vietnam, these films also allow narrative space for notions of \nvictory to re-emerge and it is to this concern that discussion now moves. The second \nmemory we explore is one of US triumphalism and victory in World War Two. It is \nhere that we tackle the ways in which these films directly attempt to engage with, and \nrewrite, historical events and work toward a new simulation of World War Two. \n \nAmerican triumphalism and effacement of history \nToday, in the post-Cold War world, Hollywood seems to have taken on a new role framing \nAmerica\u201fs history. It is now not only simply constructing patriotic contexts for its military past or \nrescuing victory from defeat, it is laying claim to other nation\u201fs victories \u2026 we are witnessing the \n 28 \nemergence of a distinctly new Hollywood war film genre (West 2000, last accessed on \n05\/09\/2007). \n \nOne of the most politically charged debates surrounding this new genre of war films is \ntheir controversial treatment of history. Baudrillard (1994) argues that we live in a time \nof historical redundancy; a time in which simulation has replaced history. We have not \nreached the end of history (Fukuyama 1992), he argues, more a reversal of it, as if \nwatching a video in rewind from end to start: We \u201csummon all past events to appear \nbefore us, to reinvestigate it all as though we are conducting a trial\u201d (Baudrillard 1994: \n11). Whilst the interrogation of the past has always been a common practice it is \nBaudrillard\u201fs suggestion that \u201ca mania for such trials\u201d (Ibid.) has taken hold in recent \nyears.  \n \n Baudrillard warns that what we are attempting, through the processes and \npractices of commemoration and remembrance is not just an investigation of the past, of \nhistory, but also an effort to \u201ecorrect\u201f it. In sum, these films and commemorations are \nseeking to produce a new history of the events of World War Two and in doing so, they \nseek to clear away the untidy bits, tie up the loose ends, a process which, as Baudrillard \nputs it: \n[consists of] \u2026 reviewing everything, rewriting everything, restoring everything, face-lifting \neverything, to produce, as it seems, in a burst of paranoia a perfect set of accounts at the end of the \ncentury, a universally positive balance sheet \u2026 and, if possible, the obliteration of all \u201enegative\u201f \nevents from our memory (Ibid. p. 12). \n \n We have already noted certain ways in which these films attempt to erase, or put \ninto shadow, certain \u201enegative\u201f memories, such as racial segregation during World War \nTwo, however, these films go much further than this. In this section we look primarily \nat the way these films produce a narrative of World War Two that is essentially \nreducible to a (virtually) solely American victory.\n10\n  \n \n 29 \n In this respect, part of the discursive power of Saving Private Ryan, as a piece of \nknowledge, comes from the subtle way in which it attempts its revision of World War \nTwo under a cloak of patriotic fervour and stunning special effects. For instance, much \nof the critical acclaim for the film comes from its depiction of the D-Day landings: the \nhorror, the randomness, the senselessness, and the brutality of war depicted more \nrealistically then ever before. However, this scene also carries with it the subtext that \nthe D-Day landings were a US-only affair. Bremmer (1998) explains the details of the \nactual operation:  \nThe history is clear: Britain and her empire contributed the bulk of the naval and air force units in \nOperation Overlord;\n11\n Britain and the US each provided two reinforced divisions for the first \nwaves in, with one coming from Canada. It is true that over half of the Allied casualties suffered \non D-Day landed at Omaha; the bulk of the rest, several thousand in number, landed and bled on \nthe Anglo-Canadian beaches. The success of Overlord derived from co-operation between the \nAllies; crucial parts were played by these nations, plus supporting Polish, French and Allied units \n(p. 50). \n \n Not only does Saving Private Ryan fail to acknowledge the role of the Allies in \nthe actual landings, the film goes further than this and fails to exhibit any notion of the \nrole of the Allied forces in the whole of Operation Overlord. There is only one reference \nto the British, and that is in the derogatory sense in which Captain Miller describes the \nBritish military commander, General Montgomery, one of the key architects of the \ninvasion plan, as \u201coverrated\u201d. The French are represented only in the form of a helpless \nfamily who need to be saved from German sniper fire by Miller\u201fs platoon. The film \npositions the whole Normandy invasion as a strictly US versus Germany affair. These \nomissions and revisions sit somewhat awkwardly in a film that went to great lengths to \nensure \u201eauthenticity\u201f: \nHe [Spielberg] sent people to scour all available material, copying the archive images and sources. \nHe hired the highly respected Steven Ambrose as historical advisor and went to extreme lengths to \nequip his men with the correct uniforms, webbing and weapons. The lead actors spent a week in \nboot camp, being abused by a former US Marine officer and veteran of the Vietnam War. They \nate, slept, exercised and got wet in authentic uniforms, eating the appropriate rations; even being \n\u201eshot\u201f at (Ibid.). \n \n Whilst Saving Private Ryan attempts to exclude other nations from participating \n 30 \nin the war, U-571 (2000), another film in this genre, actually seeks to rewrite events in \nwhich the US had no original involvement. Here, director Jonathan Mostow completely \nrevises history in portraying the capture of the German Enigma code machine, not by \nthe British Navy as contemporary accounts suggest actually happened, but by US \nsubmariners. Mostow\u201fs continual defence for this is that he sought to dramatise events \nthat \u201ccould\u201d have happened. However, listening to the director\u201fs commentary on the \nDVD version of the film, this argument wears a little thin. Especially as his preferred \ntopic in his narration is his attempts for authenticity and credibility in the detail of the \nfilm. Deeply concerned to ensure that he depicted life on a submarine realistically and \nthat all operations on the submarine are carried out \u201cas they actually were\u201d he is less \nconcerned to ensure any sense of historical accuracy over the whole mission itself. The \nBritish are only offered a single line of recognition in the film\u201fs credits.12 \n \n U-571 also seeks to reinforce a sense of triumphalism in the narrative by clearly \nsign-posting the good guys and the bad guys. It is not sufficient that the Americans are \nthe heroes who daringly capture the code machine and escape with a captured \nsubmarine after having lost most of their own crew and ship. This imagery is made \nmore explicit by Mostow\u201fs decision to show the Germans as the brutal and aggressive \n\u201eother\u201f, captured best in his portrayal of a German submarine Captain who kills and \ninjures numerous members of the American crew in a bid to thwart their mission, \ndespite their \u201enoble\u201f decision to take him prisoner rather than dispose of him. \n \n What else would you expect, Mostow informs us, \u201c\u2026 the Nazi submariners were \nthe most pro-Nazi Germans there were. All volunteers who thought they were fighting \ndirectly for Hitler.\u201d Against this, Mostow situates the \u201ccan-do American spirit. Against \nthe odds. It\u2019s what our country\u2019s built on and we pride ourselves on it. It\u2019s what you get \n 31 \nwhen you see U-571; that rousing US patriotic feeling.\u201d Through simple and clich\u00e9d \ntechniques U-571 becomes little more than \u201can audience pleaser for Americans\u201d \n(Nesbit 2002, last accessed on 06\/07\/2006). \n \n Interestingly though, this treatment of the enemy in U-571 sits awkwardly in a \ncorpus of films that, for the most part, in a revision of one of the key thematic tropes of \nthe Vietnam film, go to great length not to demonise the \u201eOther\u201f.13 Saving Private Ryan \nis careful to portray the Germans as ordinary soldiers, employing just one individual SS \nsoldier as signifier of the evil element of the Third Reich. In Pearl Harbor, great lengths \nare taken to present the Japanese in a positive light.\n14\n The film positions the Japanese as \nhaving no other option but to attack Pearl Harbor and in doing so \u201cvirtually absolves \nJapan of any wrongdoing\u201d (Null 2001, last accessed on 06\/07\/2006).  \n \n Considering this (market-driven) restraint, Pearl Harbor then has the difficulty of \nrepresenting one of America\u201fs greatest defeats during World War Two without \nemploying the easy trope of demonising the enemy. In order to circumvent this obstacle, \nand instil a sense of triumphalism, director Michael Bay tags on an extra half hour to the \nfilm depicting the Doolittle Raids against Japan. The message: \u201cNo action against the \nhome of the free can go unpunished, even if it means the retaliation \u2013 as it does in Pearl \nHarbor \u2013 seems like pretty damp squibs compared with the full-metal showstopper that \nprompted it\u201d (Pevere 2001, last accessed on 06\/07\/2006). \n \n So why the Doolittle Raid? Well, unless we include America\u201fs ultimate retaliation \nfor Pearl Harbor, the dropping of two atomic bombs over Japan (it seems Bay, and the \nprofit motive, were not prepared to invoke this military act) then Doolittle is one of only \na few potentially triumphant options to end the film. Conveniently, this particular \n 32 \nepisode is also much more in keeping with the narrative structure of the \u201cagainst the \nodds, can do spirit\u201d that pervades this genre in general. The choice also allows for the \nintroduction of another of America\u201fs heroes of World War Two, Jimmy Doolittle (see \nbelow).  \n \n One theory put forward to explain this situation, in which Hollywood seeks to \nelevate the US in triumphant superiority over its allies, is offered by West (2000) who \nsuggests that during the Cold War there was a clear distinction, a divide between East \nand West, \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem.\u201d That divide has now collapsed (or, at least, been \nreconfigured) and political alliances are being re-evaluated and reassessed and the space \nhas opened up for what West suggests is a situation in which both the victors and the \nlosers are having to reframe their notion of national identity. In this space we find: \n\u201cAmongst the victorious nations [a] level of competitiveness in claiming their role \nwithin the successful alliance\u201d (West 2000, last accessed on 05\/09\/2007). With \nAmerica\u201fs dominance of the visual forms of popular culture, notably cinema, it seems to \nbe winning this political and cultural war. Such sentiments have been felt elsewhere: \nPart of the explanation for Hollywood\u201fs especially negative and negligent treatment of the English \nin the last few years might lie in the end of the Cold War. Whereas Hollywood war films used to \nconcentrate on waste and psychosis in Vietnam, now filmmakers are more confident about \ndepicting Americans winning (or borrowing) military honour. American audiences have always \nbeen much keener to see films about Americans than about foreigners (Anon., The Economist \n15\/07\/2000: 54) \n \n A key feature in this construction of victory is the representation of those who \nfought in the war. For the final mediated memory we suggest that this genre produces a \nnew (old) imagery of the soldier hero; one that suggests that these men were the \n\u201egreatest\u201f generation. \n \n 33 \nThe Greatest Generation\n15\n and the notion of sacrifice \nIn a world in which moral certainties and principled action have given way to murkiness of \nnational purpose, moral expedience in foreign policy, and personal self-indulgence, Saving Private \nRyan is both homage to those sacrificed and an expression of longing for a time when moral \ndistinctions were far less problematic (Ehrenhaus 2001: 323). \n \nIn one of the final scenes in Saving Private Ryan, Captain Miller, with his dying breath, \nlooks to Private Ryan and says, \u201cEarn this.\u201d This simple phrase has become a \neuphemism for this whole store of filmic history and is one of the key messages being \nchampioned by a celebration of the World War Two generation. Miller\u201fs speech enables \nthe greatest generation to become, in effect, the embodiment of the morality, ideals and \nbehaviours that have set the standard for future generations to be measured by. \n \n These words take on further political significance when considering the current \nera in which we live. As Canby (1998) notes: \u201cHow war movies are accepted by the \npublic reflects the times in which they\u201fre released.\u201d (Last accessed on 15\/07\/2006). One \nway of reading this turn to memory is as a reflection on the lack of history in the present \ntime. It is for this reason, Baudrillard argues, that our history now only appears on the \ncinema screens: \u201cthe historical stake chased from our lives by this sort of immense \nneutralization, which is dubbed peaceful coexistence on a global level \u2013 this history \nexorcised by a slowly or brutally congealing society celebrates its resurrection in force \non the screen\u201d (1981: 43). \n \n For Baudrillard, previous generations, especially the greatest, lived \u201cin the march \nof history\u201d (Ibid.) and whilst we may take issue with the version of history played out \non the cinema screen, we also welcome the representations, or in Baudrillard\u201fs \nterminology, \u201csimulations\u201d, of a time when \u201cat least there was history\u201d (Ibid. p. 44). \nEven if the greatest generation does \u201conly exist in our imagination\u201d (Hasain 2001: 352), \nwe cannot deny the events through which they endured, and the sacrifices they made. \n 34 \n \n In order to celebrate the greatest generation, Spielberg constructs a military \nplatoon that is: \u201cthe very essence of American civilization and its values\u201d (Auster 2002, \nlast accessed on 07\/08\/2006). Described by Doherty (1998) as: \nA multiethnic sampling of homo americanus, the combat squad sent to extricate Private Ryan fits \nthe Warner Bros. mould: the idealized everyman leader Captain Miller (Hanks); the grizzled Sgt. \nHorvath (Tom Sizemore); the cynical tough guy Pvt. Reiben (Edward Burns); the emotional \nEyetal-ian Caparzo (Vin Disel); the edgy Jewish guy Mellish (Adam Goldberg); the \ncompassionate medic (Giovanni Ribisi); the Johnny Reb marksman (Barry Pepper); and the \nmilquetoast clerk pressed into infantryman\u201fs boots, Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davis). Bearing the \nsymbolic weight of the moral and statistical stakes, the elusive Ryan (Matt Damon) is an Iowa \nfarm boy issued from the pages of Guadalcanal Diary (p. 70). \n \n Not only is the platoon a melting pot of American masculinities and identities, \nexcluding any black characters of course, it is also infused with purpose and strong \nreligious connotation: Private Jackson, the platoon\u201fs sharpshooter, recites a prayer \nbefore every shot. Furthermore, their sacrificial mission imbues them with a kind of \nspiritual righteousness: \n[Spielberg] depicts U.S. troops (and only U.S. troops) as \u2013 almost literally - \u201cGod\u201fs warriors.\u201d \nPhrases like \u201caltar of freedom\u201d and \u201cGod\u201fs on our side\u201d are bandied about with regularity \u2026 At \none point, Captain Miller even refers to a squadron of P-51s as the \u201cangels on our shoulders.\u201d \u2026 \nIn Spielberg\u201fs vision, U.S. troops are on a holy crusade that will end only when the evil despot, \nAdolf Hitler, has been unseated (Hodgkins 2002, last accessed on 05\/06\/2005). \n \n In elevating this generation to greatness Spielberg portrays unlikely heroes: a \nschoolteacher, a farm boy from Iowa. Not men looking for fame or fortune but the \nclassic (uncommon) common men who will rally together, led by strong yet \ncompassionate leaders, and with a history of great men and God on their side, they will \nbe victorious. This is the picture Spielberg paints. Its narrative function? Perhaps to \nignite those passions, those images, for younger generations? \nBecause the Spielberg film attempts to preserve the memory of patriotic sacrifice more than it \ndesires to explore the causes of the trauma and violence, however, it is more about restoring a \nromantic version of common-man heroism in an age of moral ambivalence than about ending the \nproblem of devastating wars (Bodnar 2001:817). \n \n In this sense, Captain Miller becomes the idealised form of who we would like \n 35 \nthese men to be. He is a capable leader of men, compassionate and sympathetic. \nHowever, these are not qualities born out of a lifetime of military service. He is no \nRambo-esque vet who has only ever known war. He is a schoolteacher, he has a wife, \nand coaches\u201f kids\u201f baseball. The importance of Miller\u201fs background is fundamental to \nthe film. He is ordinary, a typical American citizen who can step up when the time \ncomes.  \n \n To further reinforce his normalness he exhibits both the physical and \npsychological scars of war as seen through the uncontrollable tremors he suffers in his \nright hand, or when he breaks down in tears following a daring raid on a German radar \nposition in which one of his platoon is killed. However, he hides the effects of this \ntrauma from his men. He is their leader and must appear strong. \n \n The choice of Tom Hanks is also interesting for the role of Captain Miller. In \nmany ways Hanks is Miller. He embodies the patriotic, moral, righteous man; \nsomething of the uncommon common man that he portrays in Saving Private Ryan. \nHanks becomes Miller; Miller, Hanks. They become intertwined. As the audience, we \nare aware of and familiar with Hanks\u201f work and we read him into the character; that \ncould have been Tom that did those things and if war ever comes again Hanks will \nprobably be a Miller. He is a simulation of himself. \n \n In contrast to Miller\u201fs unassuming but unswerving devotion to duty, his loyalty to \nhis men, his pragmatic and realistic attitude to war, Spielberg introduces the character of \nCorporal Upham; a translator enlisted into Miller\u201fs platoon. Upham has yet to see \n\u201eaction\u201f and has never fired a rifle since basic training. He is clumsy and incompetent at \nsoldiering. In simple terms Upham is na\u00efve, inexperienced, a \u201erookie\u201f. He has yet to \n 36 \nprove himself in combat and so is not yet fully accepted by the rest of the platoon.  \n \n His view of war is romanticised and idealistic, for Upham: \u201cWar is the testing \nground of righteousness, revealing the true moral order of the world; it is the context in \nwhich men bond and can express their essential masculinity\u201d (Ehrenhaus 2001: 333). \nHowever, this romanticising and fantasising is soon put to the test when he is \nconfronted with the horror of war. It is Upham who persuades Miller that they cannot \nexecute the captured German prisoner at the radar site; an act highly significant for the \nrest of the film, and for Upham\u201fs personal journey.  \n \n This German soldier, released at Upham\u201fs protest, returns to take part in the final \nfight at the bridge. He appears in two instances. First it is he who Mellish fights in a \nhand-to-hand struggle whilst Upham cowers outside the room, frozen in terror. He has a \nrifle and could easily assist his comrade. The camera switches between the close-up and \ndesperate struggle between Mellish and the German soldier, and of Upham, pitifully \ncowering in fear outside. The struggle finally comes to an end as the German soldier \npierces Mellish\u201fs chest with a bayonet. A horrific scene, uncomfortable to watch, as two \nmen, who do not even know each other, are locked in a deadly battle from which only \none of them can emerge alive. \n \n The German soldier leaves the room, dusts himself off and idly walks past \nUpham, without fear or hesitation.\n16\n Upham\u201fs moral righteousness at one point (at the \nradar position) is replaced now by his cowardice and inaction. Yet this is not the last \ndeath that Upham could have prevented. As the final fight draws to an end, Upham \nfinds himself separated from his unit and hidden amongst the German line. He has \nanother opportunity to kill the offending German soldier, but again he freezes and this \n 37 \ntime the German soldier commits the ultimate atrocity, he fatally wounds Miller. Two \ndeaths now for Upham to bear; one of them our hero, our embodiment of the greatest \ngeneration. \n \n Upham\u201fs inaction can be read in a number of ways. In certain scenes he is \nseemingly positioned as a signifier of those who objected to (the) war. In other scenes, \nof those who acted in cowardice (however that might be defined in such situations). Or \nperhaps he is a reflection of how future generations might act.\n17\n Spielberg himself \nsuggested that he sees himself most in Upham. Perhaps we all imagine ourselves as \nMiller but are more likely Upham.  \n \n Something significant then happens in the film. As the fight draws to a close, \nwhen US reinforcements arrive and turn the tide of the battle (and \u201evictory\u201f is achieved) \nand the overrun German troops are raising their hands in surrender, Upham emerges \nfrom his hiding hole and points his gun at the German captives, whose number include \nthe offending SS soldier. On recognising Upham, he calls his name, thankful it is him \nand not another who might do him harm. At this point Upham shoots the SS soldier \nbefore ushering the others away. Upham is now calm, determined, without remorse. \nWhat does this scene mean? Has Upham finally become a \u201eman\u201f, because he has shot \nsomebody? Is he simply punishing the SS soldier, and himself, for his own inaction? Is \nthe message that cowardice and \u201edifference\u201f is wrong and needs to be punished \u2013 \nUpham\u201fs punishment being the death of a friend, and his mentor? \n \n The film raises many such questions in its representation of the World War Two \nsoldier, none of which are easily answerable. However, such complexities are few and \nfar between in this genre of films as a whole, most relying instead on a more overt, \n 38 \nnostalgic construction of its (masculine) heroes. In Pearl Harbor it is Colonel Jimmy \nDoolittle who serves as the symbol of the greatest generation; his stoic, unflinching \ndevotion to duty and his men, ever present. On the eve of their attack on Japan he \naddresses his men: \nDoolittle: My friends in the War Department don\u2019t want me to lead this raid. They say I\u2019m too \nvaluable. They don\u2019t want me up there in the air flying with the men I\u2019ve chosen, that I\u2019ve chewed \nout, cursed out, pushed to the limit, and come to respect. They want me to stand on the flight deck \nand wave you off. Well, I don\u2019t see it that way \u2013 so I\u2019m going with you. \n \n In Hart\u2019s War it is the figure of Colonel McNamara who epitomises the greatest \ngeneration. The senior ranking (captive) American officer being held in a German POW \ncamp, McNamara is a fourth generation military man; a West Point graduate. \nThroughout the film he displays concern and compassion for his men and in the film\u201fs \nfinal twist shows that even when interned in a prison camp he can still \u201efight the good \nwar\u201f. McNamara has been overseeing an escape plot but the objective is not freedom \nbut the near-by factory which, whilst posing as a shoe factory is in fact a munitions \ndepot. Once the men have \u201eescaped\u201f and blown up the depot McNamara returns to the \nprison to accept responsibility for the act, knowing full well it will mean his execution. \nHowever, he does this willingly in order to save the lives of other POWs who may be \npunished for the action. He commits the ultimate sacrifice for his men and for the war. \nIn Hart\u201fs voice-over that concludes the film he notes that, through McNamara, he has \ncome to understand: \u201chonour, courage, duty, sacrifice.\u201d \n \n Beyond the variable constructions of masculine performance, a common theme \nreflected across these films is the sense of sacrifice that these men (sic) come to signify. \nRightly so, one might say, millions of men (and many thousands of women) did \nsacrifice their lives, from a great many countries and for a great many different beliefs \nand causes. In these films, however, beyond the recognition of this fact, the notion of \nsacrifice can also be read as a message to younger generations, for in Miller telling \n 39 \nRyan, the young fresh-faced future of America, to earn this, he is talking to us all.  \n \n This message is reinforced in the final moments of Saving Private Ryan in which \nwe return to the old man standing in the war cemetery,\n18\n and in a neat twist he turns out \nnot to be Miller as perhaps we originally thought, but Ryan, standing over Miller\u201fs \ngrave.\n19\n Ryan turns to his wife, breaks down, and asks if he\u201fs been a good man; if he\u201fs \nearned their sacrifice. This scene is loaded with a sentimentality and powerful guilt-\nladen rhetoric that seems to be designed to make each member of the audience question \nwhether they have earned this. Indeed, few of the newspapers commemorating the 60\nth\n \nanniversary of the D-Day landings in 2004 were complete without at least one article \nasking the question: \u201eCould we have done what they did?\u201f The answer seems to be a \nresounding no. For Peter Hitchens, writing in the Mail on Sunday: \u201cyou only have to \nask the question to know the answer\u201d (06\/06\/2004).  \n \nConclusion \nBuilding on the work begun by Nguyen and Belk in the pages of this journal, this paper \nhas sought to contribute to discussions that turn around visual consumption and \ncollective memory.  \n \n From a starting point that conceives of film as a significant force in the production \nand dissemination of collective memory, we have argued that out of Hollywood there \nhas emerged a new genre of World War Two films. These films, together with a wealth \nof similar texts that flood our TV screens, bookshops and video stores, and with the \npolitical rhetoric and scale of the 60\nth\n anniversary of the D-Day commemorations, are \ncontributing to what might be conceived of as a new discursive \u201eregime of memory\u201f \nabout the war and those that fought and lived through it. Especially significant is the \n 40 \nway this commemoration is as much about reflecting on the present as it is about \nremembering the past. \n \n We have considered three explicit memories that contribute to this project. First, it \nhas been argued that these films seek to reaffirm a particular conception of US national \nidentity and military patriotism in the post-Cold War era, and that they seek to import \nWorld War Two as the key meta-narrative of America\u201fs relationship to war and in the \nprocess \u201ecorrect\u201f and help \u201eerase\u201f Vietnam as a negative discourse. Second, these films \nalso attempt to rewrite the history of World War Two by elevating and illuminating the \nrole of the US at the expense of the Allies, further serving to reaffirm America\u201fs \nposition of political and military dominance in the current age. Third, these films, as \npart of a wider project, seek to celebrate the generation that fought World War Two, a \ngeneration whose youngest members must now be in their twilight years, to a position \nof nostalgic and sentimental greatness. Furthermore, the example they set, of collective \nspirit and notions of duty and service, also serves as a warning in the current period of \nmoral ambivalence. A period in which: \u201cThe psychodrama of congestion, saturation, \nsuper-abundance, neurosis and the breaking of blood vessels which haunts us  - the \ndrama of the excess of means over ends \u2013 calls more urgently for attention than that of \npenury, lack and poverty\u201d (Baudrillard 1994: 71).  \n \n It is important that the memories produced by these texts be reflected upon \ncritically. In their remembrance, in their celebration, they also obscure, marginalise, and \nproduce new truths: Truths that not only structure a particular conception of history, but \nmay also diminish the achievements of the past, as Ward (2001) notes: \nThe visual derivativeness casts the bankruptcy of Hollywood\u201fs remembrance of World War II into \nclear relief: each time the war\u201fs pictures are represented in a different order they are further diluted \n\u2026 in the meantime, the stories of those who actually served move that much further into obscurity \n(Last accessed on 06\/07\/2006). \n 41 \nNotes \n                                                          \n1 Films in this genre include: Saving Private Ryan (1998); U-571 (2000); Captain \nCorelli\u2019s Mandolin (2001); Charlotte Gray (2001); Enemy at the Gates (2001); Enigma \n(2001); Pearl Harbor (2001); The War Bride (2001); To End All Wars (2001); Hart\u2019s \nWar (2002); The Pianist (2002); Windtalkers (2002); Saints and Soldiers (2003); The \nGreat Raid (2005); Flags of Our Fathers (2006). \n \n2 Especially World War Two which had not received a great deal of attention by \nHollywood since the end of the Vietnam War. \n \n3 A research group established within the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary \nCulture Studies in the 1970s. \n \n4 Whilst recognising the limitations of such a brief review our purpose here has merely \nbeen to set up the films that are the focus of this paper. For a more extensive review of \nthe Vietnam genre the reader is directed to the work of Easthope (1988), Walsh and \nLouvre (1988), Jeffords (1989), Desser (1991), and Storey (2003). \n \n5 As West (2000:61-62) notes, the Vietnam War challenged America\u201fs very sense of \nnationhood. Its identity \u201csince independence [has] been closely reliant on a sense of \nsuperiority demonstrated in successive military victories\u201d (Last accessed 05\/09\/2007). \n \n6 Something Spielberg conveniently side-steps by simply having no black characters in \nthe film at all. Elsewhere in this genre of films, however, such issues are addressed: In \nHart\u201fs War the experience of black service men in the US military during World War \nTwo are explored; Windtalkers does something similar but in the context of the Navajo \ncode talkers. \n \n7 An important scene when juxtaposed with the representations of Vietnam during the \n1980s, which frequently lay the blame for defeat squarely at the door of the bureaucracy \nof the military and political hierarchy. \n \n8 A term employed by Tom Brokaw to describe the generation that fought World War \nTwo. \n \n9 Recognising the multiplicity of readings of any given text, Moses (2002, last accessed \non 15\/07\/2006) offers an alternative reading of Saving Private Ryan that is worth \nconsidering briefly. For Moses, the project of Saving Private Ryan is one far removed \nfrom erasing Vietnam but actually one that reinforces the dominant narratives in its \nreconstruction on film. Moses highlights the numerous scenes in Saving Private Ryan \nwhich turn around the decision of whether or not to shoot unarmed German prisoners \n(specifically, as discussed with regard to the opening scenes but also during the radar \nassault and in the final scenes in which Upham shoots the SS soldier, discussed below). \nThis narrative structuring depicts, he argues, \u201cSpielberg\u201fs greatest generation, in spite of \nits bravery and patriotism \u2026 in a manner more closely resembling that of American \ntroops at My Lai than that of John Wayne in World War II epics of an earlier age.\u201d \nMoses further suggests that the key element of the radar site scene is not the way that \norder is finally restored but the dissent and near mutiny of Miller\u201fs troops (reminiscent \nof many a Vietnam film). The decision to release the SS soldier at this point, only to \nhave him return later in the film to kill both Mellish and Miller, Moses suggests, can be \nread as a moral justification for the shooting of prisoners, in the context of war. \n 42 \n                                                                                                                                                                          \nUpham\u201fs final resolution to shoot the SS soldier then can be read as a necessary and \nacceptable action.  \n \nThis view is also supported by Hammond (2002). He argues that the depiction of the \nsoldier in films such as Saving Private Ryan is structured in such a way as to offer an \n\u201cequivalence\u201d between the World War Two and Vietnam genres. He goes on to argue \nthat his reading of the middle section of the film, the hunt for Private Ryan, whilst \nindeed resembling the: \u201cB-movie plot in its deployment of all of the conventions of the \n1950s combat film\u201d (p. 71) also resonates with the Vietnam genre: the break-up of the \nband of brothers at the radar site; the continual resistance the men show to a mission \nthey don\u201ft understand. These, Hammond argues, are classic tropes of the Vietnam film. \nHe goes on to cite Spielberg who claims that: \u201cWithout Vietnam I never could have \nmade Ryan as honestly as I did because Vietnam sort of showed everybody, and sort of \nprepared audiences to accept war for what it was\u201d (ibid). \n \n10 Although, it is important to note that not all films in the genre are American-centred: \nCharlotte Gray (2001); Enigma (2001); The War Bride (2001) and To End All Wars \n(2001), for example, all recount stories of British exploits in World War Two. However, \nin thinking through the discursive effects of this genre, the big-budget Hollywood films \nthat depict America\u201fs involvement in the war have certainly been the most popular and \nwidely seen (based on box office receipts). \n \n11 The codename used for the Normandy invasion. \n \n12 The following year, Michael Apted\u201fs Enigma would be released. This film tells a \n\u201eBritish\u201f version of events surrounding the Enigma code machine, albeit one equally \ntainted by historical revisionism. The historical figure Alan Turing, one of the real \nEnigma code-breakers, is replaced in the film by the fictional character of Tom Jericho: \nTuring was a homosexual who later committed suicide. Replacing this figure with the \nfictional Jericho enables the story of the code-breakers to be told in the context of a \n(heterosexual) love-story. \n \n13 An interesting representation of this theme occurs in To End All Wars, a film that \ntells the story of British POWs in a Japanese prison camp. Whilst the film recounts the \nbrutality of the Japanese guards, it does so in a way that seeks to \u201ejustify\u201f their actions, \nmost forcefully through the idea that this is simply \u201eJapanese culture\u201f: That it is a \nproduct of their warrior history, as codified in Bushido. The film also moves to suggest \nthat all \u201emen\u201f are capable of such actions. At the film\u201fs end, when the prisoners are \nliberated, we see some of them exacting their revenge on their captors by employing the \nsame forms of brutality and violence that they have experienced themselves: \u201cWhen I \nlook into my enemies eyes I see a reflection of myself\u201d muses Gordon, the film\u201fs key \nprotagonist. \n \n14 Although this may have more to do with the marketability of the film: Japan is the \nsecond largest importer of Hollywood film and a negative representation of its nation \nwill not receive a warm welcome at the box office. In fact certain scenes and dialogue \nwere reshot for the Japanese cut of the film. \n \n15 A term coined by American journalist Tom Brokaw\u201fs (1998) for his book The \nGreatest Generation in which he (seemingly uncritically) elevates and celebrates the \ngeneration that was born in the aftermath of World War One, lived through the Great \nDepression, fought during World War Two and gave birth to the \u201ebaby boomers\u201f. This \n 43 \n                                                                                                                                                                          \ngeneration, captured by Brokaw in photos, oral histories and testaments becomes the \napotheosis of human moral righteousness, courage and decency, set against the \nindividualism, lethargy and greed that is often used to describe younger generations. \n \n16 Interestingly, at this point, we learn a little more about the identity of the German \nsoldier. His insignia identifies him as a member of the SS, the faction of Hitler\u201fs army \nresponsible for the conduct of the Holocaust. Is the slow torturous death of Mellish (a \nJew), at the hands of an SS soldier, in some way an acknowledgment of that terrible \npersecution? \n \n17 We see many \u201ecopies\u201f of Upham in Vietnam films.  \n \n18 The opening scene of the film is a present-day shot of an elderly man, and his family, \nvisiting a war cemetery, in Normandy. As he stares at a specific gravestone, whose \ndetails we cannot yet read, the camera slowly zooms into the man\u201fs eyes and when they \nzoom out we have gone back in time, to the morning of the D-Day landings and the face \nwe see is Captain Miller\u201fs, who we now presume to be the elderly man at the grave-site. \nSo whatever else happens in this film, we know Tom will make it! \n \n19 Miller\u201fs death in the film is an interesting one. First, it adds that shock component; \nwe don\u201ft expect Tom Hanks to die. Second, the nature of his death is symbolic. Stunned \nby an explosion, Miller staggers to his feet and walks around aimlessly until shot by the \nSS soldier. His death serves no purpose, there is no point to it; he did not die to save a \nbuddy, or to block an oncoming assault. His death is a waste and to have Miller die in \nthis way, I would argue, is symbolic of the waste of all human life in this, and indeed all \nconflicts. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nReferences \nAnon. \u201eSaving Private Ryan review\u201f, available from www.platoscave.com.
