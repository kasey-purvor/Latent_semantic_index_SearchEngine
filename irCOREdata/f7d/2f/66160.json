Glaciers occupy an area of \u00011600 km2 in the Caucasus Mountains. There is widespread\nevidence of retreat since the Little Ice Age, but an up-to-date regional assessment of glacier change is\nlacking. In this paper, satellite imagery (Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus)\nis used to obtain the terminus position of 113 glaciers in the central Caucasus in 1985 and 2000, using a\nmanual delineation process based on a false-colour composite (bands 5, 4, 3). Measurements reveal that\n94% of the glaciers have retreated, 4% exhibited no overall change and 2% advanced. The mean retreat\nrate equates to \u00018ma\u20131, and maximum retreat rates approach \u000138ma\u20131. The largest (>10 km2) glaciers\nretreated twice as much (\u000112ma\u20131) as the smallest (<1 km2) glaciers (\u00016ma\u20131), and glaciers at lower\nelevations generally retreated greater distances. Supraglacial debris cover has increased in association\nwith glacier retreat, and the surface area of bare ice has reduced by \u000110% between 1985 and 2000.\nResults are compared to declassified Corona imagery from the 1960s and 1970s and detailed field\nmeasurements and mass-balance data for Djankuat glacier, central Caucasus. It is concluded that the\ndecrease in glacier area appears to be primarily driven by increasing temperatures since the 1970s and\nespecially since the mid-1990s. Continued retreat could lead to considerable changes in glacier runoff,\nwith implications for regional water resources.\nINTRODUCTION\nIt is widely acknowledged that glaciers are sensitive to\nclimate change (Houghton and others, 2001). In recent\nyears, several studies have reported increased glacier loss\nfrom many regions across the world, and there would appear\nto be a clear link between glacier retreat and increased\nglobal temperatures (\u2018global warming\u2019) (Meier, 1984; Oerle-\nmans, 1994, 2005; Arendt and others, 2002; Dyurgerov,\n2003). Estimates suggest that the contribution of melting\nglaciers to sea-level rise may be increasing, accounting for\nas much as 27% of sea-level rise for the period 1988\u201398,\ncompared to only 16% between 1977 and 1987 (Dyurgerov,\n2003). Modelling scenarios up to the year 2050 predict a\nmean volume loss of 60% for selected Northern Hemisphere\nglaciers, confirming that continued warming will lead to an\neven greater contribution to sea-level rise (Schneeberger and\nothers, 2003). It is increasingly urgent, therefore, to monitor\nglacier change, in terms of both its impact on global sea-\nlevel rise and the implications for water resources at a\nregional and local scale.\nIn order to make an accurate assessment of the contri-\nbution of glaciers to the global water balance, it is necessary\nto monitor changes in the areal extent of glaciers, as well as\nother parameters such as their volume and mass balance.\nAccurate glacier inventories, however, only exist for around\n40% of the world, and this dataset is biased towards\nNorthern Hemisphere glaciers, especially those in Europe,\nCanada, the USA and parts of the former Soviet Union\n(Dyurgerov, 2003). Additionally, very small glaciers are\noften under-represented in glacier inventories. Although\nthese glaciers only represent a small fraction of the\ncryosphere, they are very important water resources to local\ncommunities, and play a significant role in the water budget\nof many regions of the world, where their summer melt\nstrongly determines the seasonal runoff regime. Regular\nmonitoring of their behaviour assumes added importance\ngiven that smaller glaciers are known to respond more\nrapidly to climate change (Kaser and others, 2003).\nOne region where alpine glaciers exist is the Caucasus\nMountains, running west-northwest to east-southeast be-\ntween the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea and separating\nsouthwestern Russia from Georgia (Volodicheva, 2002).\nGlaciers cover an area of around 1600 km2 in the Caucasus\n(estimates range from 1400 to 1805 km2; Bedford and Barry,\n1994), and although mass-balance data for selected indi-\nvidual glaciers exist, an up-to-date regional assessment of\nglacier change is lacking. There is widespread evidence of\nglacier recession in this region since the end of the Little Ice\nAge (LIA; Solomina, 2000), but information concerning the\nlatter stages of the 20th century is limited. Of the few studies\nthat have focused on glacier change in the Caucasus,\nBedford and Barry (1994) reported a strong retreat trend for\n51 glaciers between 1972 and 1986. This was in marked\ncontrast to glacier change in the European Alps, where the\nnumber of glaciers retreating during this period had steadily\ndeclined (Wood, 1988).\nRemote sensing is an ideal tool for increasing the number\nof monitored glaciers at the global scale, especially in\nremote or politically sensitive areas. It has the added\nadvantage of allowing a single user to determine changes\nin glacier surface characteristics over very large areas\n(thousands of km2), and is extremely rapid when compared\nto field investigation. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and\nEnhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) are widely\nrecognized as highly valuable for glacier mapping (Bayr\nJournal of Glaciology, Vol. 52 No. 176, 2006 99\nand others, 1994; Paul, 2000, 2002; Paul and others, 2002).\nA single scene has a spatial coverage of 180 km by 180 km,\nand the high resolution of the sensor (30m; 15m in the\npanchromatic band of the ETM+) permits accurate moni-\ntoring of small glaciers \u00020.1 km2 (Paul and others, 2002).\nMore recent sensors (e.g. the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal\nEmission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)) have a higher\nspatial resolution, but their relatively recent launch dates\npreclude direct comparative investigations of glacier\nchanges during the 1980s and 1990s.\nIn this paper, TM and ETM+ are used to map the terminus\nposition of over 100 glaciers in the central Caucasus,\ncovering a study area of around 20000 km2 and focusing\nspecifically on changes between 1985 and 2000, thereby\neffectively extending the analysis of Bedford and Barry\n(1985). Associated changes in the evolution of supraglacial\ndebris during this time period are also assessed and we\ncompare our results with detailed field measurements on\nDjankuat glacier, taken to be a representative glacier for this\nregion (Haeberli and others, 2003).\nThe significance of this study is four-fold. Firstly, the\nresponse of Russian glaciers to future climate change is\nuncertain because glacier locations span more than one\nclimatic zone and are influenced by radically different\nprecipitation and temperature regimes (cf. Solomina, 2000).\nContinued monitoring of glacier behaviour from across\nRussia is necessary to inform predictions of future climate\nimpacts. Secondly, the Caucasus glaciers are a major water\nsource for the Caspian Sea, and future changes in glacier\nrunoff are likely to impact human activity and development\nin this important region (Koronkevich, 2002). Thirdly, an\nextensive mass-balance record (1967 onwards) exists for\nDjankuat glacier (Popovnin and Naruse, 2005; Shahgeda-\nnova and others, 2005), and it has been selected as the\nrepresentative glacier for the region and one of ten\nreference glaciers of the world (Haeberli and others,\n2003). An overall synthesis of the Caucasus region is\ntherefore necessary to assess the extent to which Djankuat\nglacier is representative. Lastly, glacier outburst floods and\nrelated debris flows are a significant hazard in the Caucasus\n(Bogatikov and others, 2003; Kotlyakov and others, 2003;\nSeynova and others, 2003). Remote sensing of changes in\nglaciated environments is an important tool for assessing\nand monitoring the potential for glacier hazards (e.g.\nmonitoring the evolution of proglacial lakes (Ka\u00a8a\u00a8b and\nothers, 2002)).\nMETHODOLOGY\nManual delineation of glacier outlines has been widely used\n(e.g. Rott and Markl, 1989; Williams and others, 1997), but\nit is generally recognized that semi-automated techniques\nare far more time-efficient (Paul and others, 2002). The low\nreflectivity of snow and ice in the middle part of the\nspectrum allows glacier ice to be detected from a\nsegmented\/threshold ratio image of TM bands 4 and 5 (Paul\nand others, 2002). Although the threshold value can be\nselected interactively from regions with snow and ice cast in\nshadow, automated techniques are severely hampered by\nthe presence of supraglacial debris (Paul and others, 2002).\nAs a result, glaciers with debris-covered snouts will often be\nmisrepresented using automated techniques, and manual\ndelineation from a false-colour composite image of TM\nbands 5, 4, 3 (red (R), green (G), blue (B)) is recommended\n(Paul and others, 2002). Given that many glaciers in the\nCaucasus are characterized by debris-covered termini\n(cf. Popovnin and Rozova, 2002), analysis in this paper\ninvolves manual delineation of glaciers using a false-colour\ncomposite of TM bands 5, 4 and 3.\nTo maximize the accuracy and consistency of the\nmapping, it is necessary to derive glacier changes from\ncomparison of two scenes from the same band combinations\nand with the same resolution. It is also advantageous to\nobtain scenes from exactly the same path and row, so that\nthe horizontal errors from topographic distortion are the\nsame. Having selected the path and row for our study area,\nimage selection was guided by the following principles\n(cf. Paul and others, 2002): (a) the scenes are obtained close\nto or at the end of the ablation season, minimizing potential\ncomplication from seasonal snow accumulation, and\n(b) scenes are obtained during cloud-free conditions.\nImagery was obtained from the Earth Science Data Interface\n(ESDI) at the Global Land Cover Facility, University of\nMaryland, MD, USA (http:\/\/glcfapp.umiacs.umd.edu:8080\/\nesdi\/index.jsp). Two Landsat scenes (a TM image from\nAugust 1985 and an ETM+ image from September 2000)\nwere obtained from path 171, row 30, centred on the main\nCaucasus ridge and covering the conical ice cap on the\nhighest mountain peak, El\u2019brus (5642m; see Fig. 1). These\nimages were geocorrected and co-registered using ERDAS\nImagine 8.7 software with a resampled pixel size of 25m on\nboth images. Note that this study region does not cover the\nentire glacierized area in the Caucasus and that several\nsmall ice masses occur to the northwest and southeast of this\nscene (Fig. 1).\nThe primary aim of this study is to compare recent\nchanges in the terminus positions of 113 selected glaciers\nfrom the mid-1980s to 2000. Glaciers within the study area\nwere selected for measurement on the basis that: (a) they\nhad a discernible glacier tongue\/snout fed by a catchment\narea, and (b) the snout position was readily identifiable on\nboth images in 1985 and 2000. This resulted in all major\nglaciers within our study area being measured, and only\nextremely small glaciers or glacierets <0.05 km2 being\nomitted.\nThe first step was to digitize the terminus positions of the\n113 selected glaciers (of various sizes) from the study area,\nthrough careful manual delineation on the imagery from\n1985 and 2000. Snouts were digitized on the imagery at a\nscale of between 1 : 30 000 and 1 : 15 000. Sensitivity\nanalysis of the digitizing at a scale of 1 : 30 000 found the\naccuracy to be of the order of \u000325m, i.e. the same glacier\nsnout was independently digitized 20 times and the\nmaximum distance between any two digitized snout\npositions was \u000425m. Once digitized, the difference\nbetween the terminus positions in 1985 and 2000 could\nbe accurately measured. Retreat distances for each glacier\nwere added to the glacier attribute data stored in ERDAS\nImagine. Glacier size (surface area) and the elevation of the\nterminus were obtained from Katalog Lednikov SSSR (1967\u2013\n77, 1975\u201377) to allow broad comparisons between the\nlength change data for similar glaciers (i.e. similar size and\naltitudinal range). This information was then exported to a\nspreadsheet to calculate descriptive statistics and explore\nthe relationships between mean retreat distance and glacier\nsize, etc.\nIt is well known that glacier snouts rarely retreat in a\nuniform manner, and so it is important to denote where the\nStokes and others: Changes in glacier extent in the Caucasus100\nmeasurements were taken. To maintain consistency through-\nout the study area, changes in snout position were measured\nalong the central axis (apex) of the glacier. This often\ncoincided with the distance of greatest retreat, so the\nmeasurements presented should be generally viewed as a\nmaximum retreat distance. The panchromatic band of the\nETM+ from the 2000 scene (spatial resolution 15m)\nprovided a useful independent check of the snout mapping\nat the higher multispectral resolution (25m).\nA further aim of this study is to assess associated changes\nin the amount of supraglacial debris, known to be a key\ninfluence on glacier mass balance and recession in the\nCaucasus (Popovnin and Rozova, 2002). To this end, the\nsurface area of bare ice, i.e. glacier ice without a continuous\ncovering of supraglacial debris, was digitized and compared\nbetween 1985 and 2000. The extent of bare ice was\nmanually delineated from both scenes using the 5, 4, 3 (R,\nG, B) composite at a scale of around 1 : 30 000. This band\ncombination reveals bare ice as bright blue, and there is a\ngenerally sharp transition to supraglacial debris which\nappears deep purple. It is acknowledged that delineating\nthe boundary between bare ice and debris-covered ice using\nimagery of this resolution is difficult. Additionally, the\nmeasurements only provide two snapshots from 1985 and\n2000, and supraglacial debris is likely to fluctuate over\nmuch shorter timescales, influenced by interannual vari-\nations in accumulation and ablation and non-climatic\nfactors (e.g. rockfalls). To ensure consistency, however, both\nimages were obtained from the end of the ablation season,\nand analysis was performed using the same band combin-\nation. Although the mapping is unlikely to be entirely robust,\nit does reveal general patterns in the evolution of debris\ncover across the region, which can be checked against field\nobservations (e.g. Popovnin and Rozova, 2002). Automated\ntechniques might have been much quicker at visualizing the\nbare-ice extent, but it was important to manually digitize the\nup-glacier boundaries of the debris-covered ice as accur-\nately as possible in order to assess subtle changes in the\nextent over time (e.g. the emergence of thin medial moraines\nmay have been beyond the resolution of semi-automated\ntechniques).\nAlthough the study focuses on recent changes in ice\nextent between 1985 and 2000, several declassified Corona\nimages from the 1960s and 1970s were obtained from the\nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources\nObservation Center (EROS) (http:\/\/edc.usgs.gov\/). These\nimages occur at various resolutions but provide a valuable\nwindow into the state of a handful of the glaciers in the\n1960s and 1970s. In addition, for most glaciers, the\nmaximum LIA limit was clearly revealed by a \u2018fresh\u2019\nproglacial zone characterized by an absence of vegetation.\nIn some cases, the proglacial zone was bounded by several\nlarge terminal moraines, thought to relate to the maximum\nadvance of glaciers during the 13th century, although later\nadvances are known to have occurred towards the end of the\nLIA around 1850 (Solomina, 2000). Such information\nprovides a useful context to assess the magnitude of the\nrecent changes which are the focus of this investigation.\nFig. 1. Location map of the Caucasus Mountains: (a) coverage of the Landsat scenes from path 131, row 30; (b) a false-colour composite\nimage (5, 4, 4) from 2000 showing the study area, with glacier ice in bright blue and clouds as white.\nStokes and others: Changes in glacier extent in the Caucasus 101\nRESULTS\nChange in glacier terminus position (1985\u20132000)\nThe 5, 4, 3 false-colour composite image proved accurate in\ndetermining glacier termini because: (a) proglacial melt-\nwater streams emanating from the snout were clearly visible\nas bright blue surrounded by pink\/purple unvegetated\ndebris, and (b) a drop in elevation at the terminus of a steep\nsnout often cast an obvious shadow that appears darker than\nthe surroundings.\nThe extent of debris-free ice in the study area in 2000 is\nshown in Figure 2 (grey), which also indicates the broad\ngeographical spread of the 113 glaciers where terminus\npositions were measured (black dots). The glaciated area in\nFigure 2 is estimated at 1260 km2, representing around 80\u2013\n90% of the total glaciated area in the Caucasus (Bedford and\nBarry, 1994).\nOf the 113 glaciers measured, 107 (\u000194%) retreated\nbetween 1985 and 2000. Five glaciers appear to have\nexhibited no overall change (\u00014%: marked \u2018S\u2019 in Fig. 2) and\ntwo glaciers advanced (\u00012%: marked \u2018A\u2019 in Fig. 2). These\nresults correlate well with detailed field measurement of the\nsnout position of Djankuat glacier (e.g. Popovnin and\nRozova, 2002) and are in agreement with sporadic field\nmeasurement and anecdotal evidence from other glaciers\n(e.g. field investigation confirms that Mizhirgi glacier\nadvanced between 1985 and 2000). The overall advance\nof Mizhirgi glacier between 1985 and 2000 is shown in\nFigure 3. The shadow cast by the steep snout and the\nappearance of the proglacial meltwater stream allows\naccurate determination of the snout position (Fig. 3a). This\nglacier advanced by around 108\u000325m in 15 years. Both\nglaciers that have advanced are north-facing, but there is no\nclear geographical pattern which characterizes the advan-\ncing or stationary glaciers (Fig. 2). The non-retreating\nglaciers span a number of different sizes (0.9\u201311.3 km2)\nand occur at the full range of glacier elevations in the study\narea (1850\u20133309ma.m.s.l).\nThe vast majority of the glaciers in the study region\nretreated. The mean retreat distance was 121\u0003 25m,\nequivalent to 8.1ma\u20131 between 1985 and 2000. The\nmaximum retreat distance was 571\u0003 25m (retreat rate \u00bc\n38ma\u20131) for Karaugom glacier in the southeast of the study\narea. Figure 4 shows the frequency distribution of terminus\nchange for all 113 measured glaciers. It can be seen that the\nmajority (\u000170%) of glaciers retreated 0\u2013150m.\nThe glacier length change data were sorted according to\nthe size of the glaciers. Although there is no statistically\nsignificant correlation between glacier size and terminus\nretreat, the general pattern is that the larger glaciers have\nretreated further. Figure 5 shows the mean retreat distance\nfor each size class of glacier; it can be seen that glaciers\n>10 km2 have retreated almost twice as far as glaciers\n<1 km2. It should be remembered, however, that the retreat\nrate is likely to be more comparable between large and\nsmall glaciers if the retreat is calculated as a percentage of\noverall glacier length.\nGlacier length changes were also assessed with respect to\nthe elevation of the glacier snout. Again, although there is no\nstatistically significant relationship for the whole sample,\nFigure 6 illustrates that glaciers at higher elevations have, in\ngeneral, retreated less than those at lower elevations. This\nwould be expected if the snouts of glaciers at lower\nelevations are more sensitive to climatic (temperature?)\nforcing than those at higher elevations.\nThe pattern of retreat for six neighbouring glaciers,\nincluding Djankuat glacier, is shown in Figure 7, indicating\nthe different response of different-sized glaciers. For\nexample, Shkhelda glacier (furthest west in Fig. 7) retreated\naround 350m between 1985 and 2000, compared to around\n30m for Djankuat glacier (furthest east in Fig. 7). Indeed, the\nretreat distance of Shkhelda glacier is the second largest\nmeasured in the study area. Its retreat is characteristic of\nmany of the glaciers, in that it appears to be accompanied by\na general increase in debris cover migrating up-glacier. A\nsimilar situation has been reported from detailed field\nmeasurements on Djankuat glacier (Popovnin and Rozova,\n2002). The up-ice increase in debris cover on Shkhelda\nglacier is clearly observable in Figure 8, which shows that\ndebris cover has increased on the feeding tributary glaciers\n(labelled \u2018T\u2019 and \u2018T2\u2019) and on the main glacier trunk\n(labelled \u2018D\u2019), reducing the amount of bare ice visible at\nthe surface.\nThe satellite imagery also reveals the inferred maximum\nLIA limit of Shkhelda glacier (Fig. 8b). This limit is taken to\nbe the \u2018fresh\u2019 unvegetated proglacial zone in front of the\nFig. 2. Map of the central Caucasus showing the extent of debris-free ice in 2000 (grey) and the location of the 113 measured glaciers\n(black dots).\nStokes and others: Changes in glacier extent in the Caucasus102\nsnout (pink\/purple colours), which appears in marked\ncontrast to adjacent vegetated areas which appear as bright\ngreen (Fig. 8). Although the timing of the LIA limit in the\nCaucasus is complex (see Solomina, 2000), the glacier has\nretreated around 1300m from the LIA maximum extent.\nAround 350m of this retreat (>25%) has occurred since\n1985. For those glaciers where a clear LIA limit can be easily\ndetermined on the satellite imagery (n \u00bc 72), the mean\npercentage of post-LIA retreat accomplished between 1985\nand 2000 is 15%.\nThe pattern of glacier loss towards the end of the 20th\ncentury is further emphasized by the Corona imagery from\nthe 1960s. Figure 9 compares the position of Tsanner glacier\non a Corona image from August 1964 with that of the ETM+\nscene in 2000. Although the resolution of the Corona\nimagery does not allow accurate measurement of the glacier\nsnout (and is somewhat distorted), it can be clearly seen that\nthe glacier tongue has changed its configuration and has\nnarrowed and retreated from its position in 1964. The 1964\nscene also shows the formation of a medial moraine where a\nsmaller tributary glacier feeds the main east-to-west flow. In\n2000, however, it would appear that this smaller glacier\n(renamed north Tsanner glacier) is no longer contributing ice\nto Tsanner glacier. The Corona imagery confirms that the\nretreat between 1985 and 2000 is not anomalous but is part\nof an overall phase of glacier retreat since the 1960s and\n1970s. This conclusion is supported by evidence of wide-\nspread retreat between 1972 and 1986 as reported by\nBedford and Barry (1994).\nChange in the distribution of supraglacial debris cover\n(1985\u20132000)\nSupraglacial debris cover is known to have an important\ninfluence on glacier mass balance primarily through its\ninfluence on ablation (Benn and Evans, 1998). A secondary\naim of this study, therefore, is to assess the changes in the\nevolution of debris cover on Caucasus glaciers. To this end,\nthe extent of debris-free ice was mapped in 1985 and 2000.\nFigure 10 shows the change in the areal extent of debris-free\nice between 1985 and 2000, indicating that a marked\nreduction has taken place throughout the study area\n(coloured red). This measurement, like the terminus position\nmeasurement, is subject to a small error, but this was\nminimized by manual delineation of the boundary between\ndebris-free and debris-covered ice and is largely insignif-\nicant given the total glaciated area is >1000 km2 (see\nFig. 3. Landsat satellite imagery (5, 4, 3: R, G, B) showing the\nadvance of Mizhirgi glacier, 1985\u20132000. (a) In 2000, the snout\nposition is clearly visible because of the shadow and the bright blue\nappearance of the proglacial stream. (b) In 1985, the meltwater\nstream emanates from a different position at the terminus. (c) With\nthe two snout positions overlaid, it is clearly seen that the snout has\nadvanced by 110\u0003 25m. This is one of only two glaciers from the\n113 sampled showing an overall advance between 1985 and 2000.\nFig. 4. Frequency distribution of terminus change for 113 selected\nglaciers in the central Caucasus.\nStokes and others: Changes in glacier extent in the Caucasus 103\nFig. 10). This preliminary analysis indicates that the area of\ndebris-free ice was \u00011260 km2 in 1985 but decreased to\n\u00011136 km2 in 2000, an approximate decrease of \u000110% in\n15 years.\nIt could be the case that the decrease in extent of debris-\nfree ice is solely related to an increase in debris cover and\nthat the extent of the glaciers has remained unchanged.\nHowever, glacier retreat has also occurred on the relatively\ndebris-free glaciers which drain the northern portion of the\nconical ice cap on Gora El\u2019brus (shown in Fig. 10b\u2013d). These\nglaciers generally lack the debris mantle typical of the\nglaciers flowing through steep-sided valleys, and the reduc-\ntion in bare ice in this area is only a result of deglaciation.\nThus, although we have no quantitative measurements of the\nchange in the percentage area of debris-covered ice between\n1985 and 2000, our observations indicate that the \u000110%\ndecrease in bare ice is attributable to both an increase in\ndebris cover and glacier retreat.\nDISCUSSION\nGlacier retreat and climatic warming\nMany studies from around the world have reported in-\ncreased glacier loss in conjunction with increased global\ntemperatures during the latter decades of the 20th century\n(Oerlemans, 1994; Arendt and others, 2002; Francou and\nothers, 2003). Our analysis would appear to suggest that\nCaucasus glaciers have undergone a similar pattern of retreat\nin recent decades. The significance of these changes,\nhowever, can only be assessed with reference to longer-\nterm fluctuations.\nSolomina (1999, 2000) estimated the magnitude of\nglacier retreat from the LIA maximum to the second half\nof the 20th century (1950s\u20131980s) in the former Soviet\nUnion. These data were based on aerial photographs and\nchronosequences of vegetation development on LIA\nmoraines. In the Caucasus, the dating of LIA moraines is\ncomplicated by the fact that there appear to be two broad\nage ranges: \u0001AD 1300 and \u0001AD1700 (Serebryannyy and\nothers, 1984, cited in Solomina, 2000, fig. 2). Nevertheless,\nSolomina (2000) estimated that Caucasus glaciers had\nretreated, on average, around 611m (max. 2800m and\nmin. 150m) from the end of the 19th century to the mid-\n20th century.\nBedford and Barry (1994) reported that Caucasus glaciers\nwere generally retreating between the 1960s and 1980s.\nThis is in contrast to the global dataset, albeit dominated by\nglaciers in the European Alps (Wood, 1988), which shows a\ntrend towards glacier advance through the 1960s to 1981\nFig. 5. Mean retreat distance for different-sized glaciers in the\ncentral Caucasus.\nFig. 6. Mean retreat distance for glaciers at different elevations in\nthe central Caucasus.\nFig. 7. Retreat for six neighbouring glaciers in the central Caucasus between 1985 (yellow) and 2000 (red), including Djankuat glacier\n(furthest east), which has an extensive mass-balance record. Also note the location of Shkhelda glacier (furthest west) which exhibits one of\nthe largest retreat rates in the region.\nStokes and others: Changes in glacier extent in the Caucasus104\n(Bedford and Barry, 1994). The data presented here extend\nthe analysis of Bedford and Barry (1994) and indicate that\nthe retreat trend has continued throughout the 1980s and\n1990s. It should be noted, however, that the period from the\nlate 1980s to the early 1990s was relatively favourable for\nCaucasus glaciers and that retreat rates have greatly\naccelerated since the mid-1990s.\nWe also note that seasonal average temperatures at\nTerskol (Shahgedanova and others, 2005), central Caucasus,\nshow a general decrease from the 1950s to the mid-1970s\nand then begin to increase from the mid-1970s (see Fig. 11).\nThis suggests that the retreat of Caucasus glaciers from the\nmid-1970s to 2000 (this paper) correlates well with the\ntemperature record. Shahgedanova and others (2005) note\nthat recent temperature increases during the ablation\nseason on Djankuat glacier have not been compensated\nfor by increases in winter precipitation and accumulation.\nIndeed, the strong warming signal that has emerged since\nthe mid-1990s has led to a significant increase in summer\nmelt during the ablation season. The decrease in glacier\nlength reported in this paper, therefore, appears to be\nprimarily driven by increasing temperatures since the 1970s\nand especially since the mid-1990s (Shahgedanova and\nothers, 2005). Analysis of the monthly temperature record at\nTerskol indicates that the mean annual retreat rate of 8.1m\nbetween 1985 and 2000 corresponds to an annual increase\nof 0.18C in the ablation season temperature. This is in broad\nagreement with the notion that recent changes in glacier\nlength are a reliable indicator of global warming (Oerle-\nmans, 1994, 2005).\nEvolution of debris cover on Caucasus glaciers\nDebris cover on a glacier\u2019s snout can influence the rate of\nablation in two main ways. A thin layer of debris (generally\n<1\u20132 cm) will lower the albedo and absorb more shortwave\nradiation than bare ice. This results in an increase in ablation\nFig. 8. Increase in debris cover on Shkhelda glacier during terminus retreat. (a) The terminus position in 1985, clearly marked by the\nemergence of the meltwater stream at an indent at the snout. (b) The emergence of the same stream marks the terminus position in 2000,\napproximately 350m back from the 1985 position. This retreat is accompanied by an increase in debris cover on the feeding tributaries\n(cf. \u2018T\u2019 and \u2018T2\u2019 in (a) and (b)) and in the centre of the glacier (cf. \u2018D\u2019 in (a) and (b)). The zone of unvegetated debris in the proglacial area\n(pink) marks the LIA limit.\nFig. 9. Change in the configuration of Tsanner glacier between 1964 (b) and 2000 (a). Corona imagery provides information from the 1960s.\nIn this case, the glacier has retreated and narrowed at the snout (see (a)). Also note the active formation of a medial moraine in 1964. In\n2000, this tributary is no longer contributing ice to the main trunk glacier.\nStokes and others: Changes in glacier extent in the Caucasus 105\nof the underlying and adjacent ice (Bozhinskiy and others,\n1986; Benn and Evans, 1998). When debris thickness\nincreases (>5\u201310mm), however, it has the effect of shielding\nthe underlying ice from incoming solar radiation and greatly\nreduces ablation (cf. \u00d8strem, 1959; Nakawo and Young,\n1982). Thus, thin patchy debris will generally increase\nablation, and thick, continuous debris cover will reduce\nablation. Benn and Evans (1998) state that where debris\ncover on glacier tongues is thick and continuous, such as in\nmany high mountain environments, ablation at the snout\ncan be greatly reduced and is often confined to the steeper\nslopes up-glacier. The result is that ablation is focused on the\nsteeper slopes and the glacier retreats through a process\nknown as \u2018backwasting\u2019. It is also known that the presence\nof a thick debris mantle may decouple the glacier from\nclimatic forcing such that debris-covered glaciers respond\nmore slowly to climatic changes (Benn and Evans, 1998). In\naddition, debris-covered snouts can become separated from\nmore rapidly ablating ice further up-glacier and eventually\nstagnate and waste away in situ.\nThe analysis presented here indicates that the surface\narea of debris-free ice has decreased by around 10%\nbetween 1985 and 2000 (Fig. 10). This reduction appears to\nbe attributable to both glacier retreat (e.g. Fig. 10) and an\nincrease in debris cover (e.g. Fig. 8). This conclusion is\nsupported by field measurements on Djankuat glacier,\nwhich indicate that the total area of debris cover increased\nfrom 3% to 10% of the entire glacier area between 1968\nand 1999 during glacier retreat (Popovnin and Rozova,\n2002). Furthermore, a general pattern was detected whereby\nthe more negative the mass balance, the higher the rate of\ndebris accumulation. Our analysis suggests that this pattern\nis typical of Caucasus glaciers as a whole: they are\nretreating, and supraglacial debris is increasing. This is not\nsurprising given that a characteristic of retreating glaciers is\nthe formation of supraglacial debris from thinning at the\nsnout and the areal melt-out of debris from within the\nglacier body (Popovnin and Rozova, 2002). What is more\ninteresting is that the shielding effect of the increased\nsupraglacial debris on Caucasus glaciers is not enough to\noffset the widespread retreat of their termini. Conversely, it\ncould be argued that the debris cover is preventing what\nwould otherwise be an even more rapid retreat. Exploration\nof the relationship between debris-cover thickness, mass\nbalance and frontal variations is clearly warranted in the\nfuture.\nComparison of remote-sensing results with Djankuat\nglacier field measurements\nDjankuat glacier is a small northwest-facing temperate\nvalley glacier around 3 km2. Located at 43812\u2019N, 42846\u2019 E,\nit lies at an elevation of 2700\u20133900m on the main Caucasus\nridge and delivers meltwater to the Caspian Sea via the\nAdylsu, Baksan, Malka and Terek rivers. It is one of the most\nextensively studied Russian glaciers and has an uninter-\nrupted directly measured mass-balance record going back to\n1967 (Dyurgerov and Popovnin, 1988; Shahgedanova and\nothers, 2005). For this reason, the World Glacier Monitoring\nService chose it as one of ten reference glaciers of the world\n(Haeberli and others, 2003).\nFig. 10. Change in the areal extent of bare ice, 1985\u20132000. (a) The red areas denote the loss of bare ice since 1985 (\u000110%). (b) This\nreduction is clearly seen on the glaciers draining the northern margin of the El\u2019brus volcanic cone. (c, d) These glaciers are generally debris-\nfree and it can be seen that retreat has been quite rapid in places (see \u2018D\u2019). Also note the increase in area of a large nunatak (\u2018N\u2019).\nDeglaciation has also led to the development of small proglacial lakes (see \u2018L\u2019) which may lead to the realization of further geohazards in\nthe Caucasus.\nStokes and others: Changes in glacier extent in the Caucasus106\nLike most other Caucasus glaciers, Djankuat has retreated\nsignificantly during the 20th century. Photographic archives\nshow a retreat of approximately 400m between \u00011930 and\n1996 (Aleynikov and others, 2002a). The terminus remained\nquasi-stationary in the 1980s, however, despite several years\nof negative mass balance between 1981 and 1986. In recent\nyears (mid-1990s onwards), a retreat trend appears to have\nemerged, which has been matched by an increasingly\nnegative mass balance (Popovnin and Naruse, 2005; see\nFig.12). Field observations suggest a retreat of around 25m\nbetween 1985 and 2000. This compares well with our\nindependent measurement of 30\u000325m from the Landsat\nsatellite imagery.\nDjankuat glacier has retreated much less than most of the\nother glaciers in this study (ranked at 102 out of 113). Its\nmean annual retreat rate of \u00012ma\u20131 contrasts with the mean\nannual retreat rate of >8ma\u20131 for all the glaciers measured\nbetween 1985 and 2000. Moreover, glaciers of a similar size\nto Djankuat glacier (2.5\u20134.9 km2) have a mean retreat\ndistance of \u0001138m between 1985 and 2000, much greater\nthan the 30m observed at this glacier (Fig. 5). Glaciers at a\nsimilar elevation (2500\u20132999ma.m.s.l.) have also, on\naverage, retreated much further (\u0001115m) than Djankuat\nglacier (Fig. 6).\nA possible explanation for the low retreat rate may relate\nto the morphological pecularity of the Djankuat glacier\ncatchment area. This lies partly on the Djantugan firn\nplateau which rests on the crestal zone of the main Caucasus\nridge and serves as a source of ice to glaciers on both sides\nof the ridge. Recently, it has been observed (Popovnin, 1995;\nAleynikov and others, 2002b) that the ice divide on the\ncrestal zone of the Djantugan plateau is migrating south,\nenlarging the Djankuat glacier catchment area. This recent\nincrease in the accumulation area of the glacier is not\nincorporated in the mass-balance calculations. As a result,\nthe glacier mass balance is likely to be less negative than has\nbeen calculated. Moreover, Aleynikov and others (2002a)\nnote that there is a pulse-like entry of ice into the glacier\ntongue from the Djantugan plateau, resulting from ice\ndamming at a narrow passage above an icefall. They suggest\nthat the process of ice flow from the catchment area may\nresemble that of \u2018mini-surges\u2019 which are transmitted to the\nglacier snout as kinematic waves (cf. Zolotaryov and others,\n1997). As such, the response of the glacier to atmospheric\nforcing may be non-linear over short timescales. It should\nalso be noted that Popovnin (1996) found that fluctuations of\nDjankuat glacier appeared to be more pronounced in the\nupper regions than near the terminus. He notes that ice\ncover on the steep revetment is thin, and complete melting\naway of parts of the glacier leads to dramatic changes in\nglacier surface area.\nA further possible explanation for the low retreat rate of\nDjankuat glacier compared to other glaciers might be\nrelated to the increased shielding effect of supraglacial\ndebris near the snout, which has generally thickened in\nrecent years (Popovnin and Rozova, 2002). It should be\nnoted, however, that other glaciers with a continuous debris\ncover have retreated much greater distances during the\nobservation period (see Fig. 6).\nCONCLUSIONS\nCurrent concerns over anthropogenic climate change make\nit increasingly urgent to monitor glaciers and evaluate their\nimpact on sea level and regional water resources. This paper\nutilizes Landsat satellite imagery and reports changes in the\nterminus position of 113 selected glaciers in the Caucasus\nbetween 1985 and 2000. The vast majority (\u000194%) of the\nglaciers have retreated since 1985, with a mean retreat\ndistance of 121m (8.1ma\u20131). Grouping of glaciers with\nrespect to their size indicates that the largest glaciers\n(>10 km2) have retreated more than twice as far as the\nsmallest glaciers (<1 km2), with mean retreat distances of\n\u0001179 and \u000189m, respectively. In addition, glaciers at lower\nelevations have retreated further than those at higher\nelevations. In some cases, the retreat distance of individual\nglaciers represents a significant (\u000125%) proportion of their\noverall retreat since the inferred LIA limit. This suggests that\nglacier loss has increased towards the end of the 20th\ncentury and is in accordance with temperature records in the\nCaucasus that reveal a warming trend since the 1970s and\nparticularly since the mid-1990s (cf. Shahgedanova and\nothers, 2005).\nRemote-sensing and field observations indicate that\nglacier retreat has been accompanied by an increase in\ndebris cover, and our analysis indicates that the areal extent\nof debris-free ice has reduced by around 10% between 1985\nand 2000. This reduction is not solely attributable to the\nincrease in debris cover, since observations reveal that\nFig. 11. Time series of seasonal average temperatures (8C) for\nTerskol (modified from Shahgedanova and others, 2005). Solid lines\nshow long-term average (1951\u20132001). Terskol is situated in the\ncentral Caucasus (43815\u2019N, 42831\u2019 E), approximately 7 km south-\nwest of the margin of the El\u2019brus conical ice cap and at an altitude\nof 2141m.\nFig. 12. Cumulative mass balance of Djankuat glacier (see also\nShahgedanova and others, 2005).\nStokes and others: Changes in glacier extent in the Caucasus 107\ndebris-free glaciers have retreated. The increase in debris\ncover is likely a result of glacier thinning and the melt-out of\ndebris from within the glacier body. We note that the\nshielding effect of the increased debris cover is not enough\nto compensate for the widespread retreat of glacier termini.\nThe effect of the debris cover, however, may have been to\nreduce what would otherwise have been a greater extent of\nglacier retreat.\nThe results presented here have been compared to\ndetailed field measurements of the frontal variations, debris\ncover and mass balance of Djankuat glacier, selected as the\nrepresentative glacier for the Caucasus and one of ten\nreference glaciers of the world (Haeberli and others, 2003).\nThese comparisons reveal that the behaviour of Djankuat\nglacier broadly matches the characteristics of other glaciers\nin the region: debris cover has increased and the glacier has\nretreated, although at a much lesser rate than glaciers of a\nsimilar size and elevation. It is argued that this is due to local\nfactors relating to the glacier\u2019s configuration.\nThe widespread, and apparently increasing, decline of\nCaucasus glaciers holds important implications for regional\nwater resources. Runoff from Caucasus glaciers represents a\nmajor source for the Caspian Sea, and future changes in\nglacier area are likely to impact human activity and\ndevelopment in this economically important region.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis research was funded by the School of Human and\nEnvironmental Sciences at The University of Reading.
