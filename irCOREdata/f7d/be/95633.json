Introduction\nLearning in schools takes place in a group setting, and the composition\nof the group possibly affects individual outcomes. There has been a lot\nof interest in these types of social interactions in economics recently and\nin peer effects in school in particular. We revisit this issue in this paper,\ndrawing on a previously unexploited data set in this context, the Progress\nin International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) for fourth graders. Our\nanalysis covers six European countries: Germany, France, Iceland, the\nNetherlands, Norway, and Sweden.\nOne of the main challenges in the literature on peer effects is the feature\nthat schools and classrooms are not formed randomly. School and class\ncomposition typically reflects neighborhood characteristics and therefore\nthe family background of students. The estimated peer effect may capture\nunobserved aspects of an individual student\u2019s performance if this problem\nis ignored. We exploit the fact that the PIRLS survey samples multiple\nclassrooms within a single school. This allows us to estimate peer effects\nwithin schools. Since we study students in primary schools, there is no\nexplicit tracking in any of the countries in our sample. In Section IV we\nargue that classes within schools are in fact formed more or less randomly\nwith respect to family background characteristics (other than immigrant\nstatus). The variation in our peer variable therefore most likely reflects\nthat there will be small differences in composition when multiple groups\nare formed out of a small population (in essence the absence of the law\nof large numbers). Hence, our research design allows for a relatively\ncredible identification of peer effects on student test scores.\nThe existing literature has used a wide variety of approaches to identify\npeer effects. The papers closest in spirit to ours are the ones by Hoxby\n(2000) and Vigdor and Nechyba (2004) for the United States and Gould,\nLavy, and Paserman (forthcoming) for Israel. These papers similarly rely\non differences in the compositions of individual classes within a school,\nwhich come about by chance. Hanushek et al. (2003) and McEwan (2003)\nalso use within-school variation to identify peer effects. However, it is\nmore difficult to believe that differences in class composition are random\nin their cases. We will compare our methodology in detail to the existing\nliterature in the next section. A number of recent studies have also used\nexplicit random assignment to classes or schools or other natural exper-\niments. However, none of these studies pertain to European countries.\nAn important issue in our context is the fact that our peer measure is\nself-reported by the students\u2019 parents and that the sample does not include\nall students in a classroom. These features will lead to measurement error\nin both the individual- and peer-level variables in the regression and hence\nto biased estimates. Moreover, the size of the bias will differ in the ordinary\nleast squares (OLS) and within-school estimates. We address these issues\nPeer Effects in European Primary Schools 317\nin Section VI in two ways. The first is to use an alternative variable for\nfamily background as an instrument. The second is to look at the ratio\nof the peer- and individual-level family background effects. We show that\nthe within-school estimator for this ratio is not affected by measurement\nerror under a simple measurement error model. Nevertheless, even this\nestimator is biased when not all students in a class are sampled. We adjust\nour estimates for the sampling error in the peer variable arising from\nmissing students. Clarifying the impact of measurement error on estimates\nof peer effects is an important contribution of our paper. The only other\npaper in the literature dealing with missing observations in peers\u2019 models\nis concurrent work by Sojourner (2008). His analysis complements ours\nsince he allows for more general processes generating missing students,\nbut he does not analyze measurement error explicitly.\nOn average across countries, we find that a one-standard-deviation\nchange in our measure of peer composition leads to a 0.17-standard-\ndeviation change in reading test scores, and this estimate is marginally\nsignificant. The size of this effect is slightly larger than most estimates\nreported in the literature. However, the confidence interval for our mea-\nsurement error corrected estimate is fairly large. Moreover, the pattern of\nour results is largely consistent with a story based purely on measurement\nerror, but systematic selection into schools by family background seems\nto play little role.\nII. Empirical Framework and Existing Literature\nAs in many peer effects studies, we start from a reduced-form speci-\nfication of an education production function of the form\ny p a \u0001 bX \u0001 gS \u0001 lX \u0001 m \u0001 e , (1)ics s ics cs cs ics(\u0002i)cs\nwhere is a student outcome, such as a test score, for student i inyics\nclassroom c and school s; are student or family characteristics, suchXics\nas sex, family background, and so forth; are school- or class-levelScs\ncharacteristics, such as class size, teacher experience, characteristics of the\nmunicipality, and so forth; and are the average characteristics of theX(\u0002i)cs\npeers of student i. In addition, and are, respectively, class-level andm ecs ics\nindividual-level error terms. The reduced form is silent on how the peer\neffect arises. In the language of Manski (1993), l could capture either\nexogenous (or contextual) or endogenous effects. Exogenous effects arise\nwhen individuals learn more because the group of peers is more favorable\nin terms of their predetermined characteristics. Endogenous effects arise\nwhen individuals learn more because peers are learning more. We make\nno attempt at separating these.\nThe term reflects correlated effects. Correlated effects arise whenmcs\nthe group of peers is subject to a common influence, which is not modeled\n318 Ammermueller\/Pischke\ndirectly. These effects will give rise to a bias if they are correlated with\npeer group composition. For example, consider a remedial classroom with\nrelatively poorly performing children. This classroom may be assigned a\nparticularly able teacher, but the exceptional characteristics of this teacher\nare not observable. Removing the potential bias from correlated effects\nis one of the main challenges in the peer effects literature.\nIf some relevant school or classroom characteristics are not controlled,\nthe estimated peer effect will be biased. Random assignment of students\u02c6l\nand teachers to classrooms solves this problem because random assign-\nment breaks the link between peer characteristics and extraneous effects\non the class, like unobserved teacher quality. Boozer and Cacciola (2001)\nand Graham (2008) exploit the random assignment in the Tennessee Stu-\ndent\/Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) experiment on class size. Cullen,\nJacob, and Levitt (2006) use lotteries at oversubscribed Chicago public\nschools. However, their paper does not focus on the issue of peer effects.\nTrue random assignment variation is rare in an education context and\nunavailable in many countries. Hence, researchers have to resort to other\nstrategies utilizing the existing data. In this paper, as in a variety of related\nstudies, we use variation within schools in order to identify the peer effect.\nThis means that we include school fixed effects, , in our regression (1).1as\nThe idea behind this strategy is the observation that different schools\ndraw students from different neighborhoods and hence family back-\ngrounds. Hence, the unobserved characteristics will be systematicallymcs\nrelated to at the school level. However, students are not generallyX(\u0002i)cs\ngrouped into classes on the basis of ability or family background in pri-\nmary school. Although some countries, such as Germany, track students\ninto a rigid system of separate schools at the secondary level, there is no\nsystemwide tracking at the primary level. In fact, classes in primary\nschools with multiple classrooms at the same grade level are typically\nformed more or less on a random basis. In this case, will be un-X(\u0002i)cs\ncorrelated with the class-level shocks conditional on a set of schoolmcs\nfixed effects or the characteristics of school peers. The bias from correlated\neffects is thus removed, and l can be estimated consistently.\nIn order to make this argument more precise, consider the following\nsimple model generating student characteristics:\nX p h \u0001 v ; (2)ics cs ics\nthat is, student characteristics consist of a common classroom-level mean\n1 Alternatively, we could introduce peer variables at the school level directly\ninto the estimating equation. Both approaches lead to very similar results.\nPeer Effects in European Primary Schools 319\nand an idiosyncratic, mean zero student-level component , whichh vcs ics\nis uncorrelated with and . The peer mean ish ecs ics\n\u00afX p h \u0001 v . (3)cs (\u0002i)cs(\u0002i)cs\nCorrelated effects arise whenever . Estimates of bothCov (h , m )( 0cs cs\nb and l will therefore be biased in the estimation of equation (1). Our\nbasic identifying assumption is ; that is, the systematic componenth p hcs s\nof the student background characteristic arises only at the school level\nbut not at the class level. Random assignment of students and resources\nto classes within schools would ensure that this condition is met. Let the\noperator perform the within transformation, so that .\u02dc \u02dc \u00afD Da p a \u0002 aics ics s\nHence, peer characteristics within schools are ; that is,\u02dc \u02dc \u00afDX p Dv(\u0002i)cs(\u0002i)cs\nvariation in the peer measure comes only from the fact that inv\u00af ( 0(\u0002i)cs\nsmall groups. A necessary condition for the within-school estimation to\nwork is, of course, that there is sufficient variance in peer composition\nof a classroom within a school, which is the case in our data; see Section\nIII below.\nOur identification strategy is most closely related to that of McEwan\n(2003) and Vigdor and Nechyba (2004, 2006). McEwan studies peer effects\nfor eighth graders in Chile. However, random assignment to classes within\nschools is much less likely to happen at the secondary level because schools\nin many countries, including Chile, track students to at least some degree.\nIf there is tracking on the basis of (unobserved) ability, estimates of l are\nstill confounded by correlated effects. Vigdor and Nechyba (2004) also\nrely on school fixed effects for identification. Their results are for fifth\ngraders in North Carolina, an age group for which tracking is less of an\nissue. However, they report evidence that classroom assignment does not\nlook random in most schools. Hence, in their preferred estimates, they\nrestrict themselves to a subsample of schools for which classroom as-\nsignment looks random on the basis of preliminary tests. However, this\npretesting approach is not completely satisfying. In this paper, in contrast,\nwe argue that classroom assignment is random in European schools for\ninstitutional reasons, and we successfully verify this claim with tests sim-\nilar to those employed by Vigdor and Nechyba (2004).\nThe papers by Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor (2006) and Vigdor and\nNechyba (2006) cast some doubt on their main identifying assumption\nof random classroom assignment within schools. Using the same data for\nNorth Carolina elementary schools, Clotfelter et al. present some evidence\nthat better teachers are assigned to classrooms with better students, even\nwithin schools. This may be due to \u201cteacher shopping\u201d by parents or to\nthe ability of better teachers to avoid assignment to classes with more\npoorly performing students.\n320 Ammermueller\/Pischke\nIn an alternative approach, Vigdor and Nechyba (2006) find positive\nand significant peer effects in models with school fixed effects. They then\ngo and introduce teacher fixed effects, hence comparing successive cohorts\nof students assigned to the same teacher. The introduction of teacher fixed\neffects in addition to school fixed effects leads to significantly negative\nestimates of peer effects. This suggests that random assignment of students\nto classrooms does not seem to be satisfied in the North Carolina context,\nand their results cast some doubt on their own earlier findings (Vigdor\nand Nechyba 2004). We are less worried about their findings for the case\nof European primary schools because we believe that the practice of\nteacher shopping or the purposeful assignment of good teachers to better\nclasses is absent or comparatively unimportant in the countries we analyze.\nHoxby (2000), Hanushek et al. (2003), and Gould et al. (forthcoming)\nalso use within-school variation to identify peer effects. The Hoxby and\nGould et al. studies are similar in spirit to ours. We use comparisons\nacross classrooms within the same grade for the same cohort of students.\nHoxby uses comparisons between classes in the same grade across adjacent\ncohorts and years. Hence, she identifies peer effects from variation arising\nfrom the composition of subsequent cohorts. For example, one cohort\nmay have more girls and the next cohort fewer for purely random reasons.\nGould et al. also use data on multiple cohorts in the same grade. They\ncondition on the student composition of the grade across multiple cohorts\nof students. Effectively, like Hoxby, they therefore exploit year-to-year\nvariation in the composition of successive cohorts of students. However,\nthese studies tend to focus on peer group measures different from ours.\nHoxby looks at gender and race composition of the classroom and per-\nformance by opposite gender and race groups, whereas Gould et al. look\nat the share of immigrants.\nHanushek et al. (2003) focus on a peer measure more similar to ours.\nThey also control for school by grade effects like Hoxby and Gould et\nal. However, they track the same cohort of students over time, rather\nthan different cohorts, and they also control for student fixed effects. This\nmeans that they effectively consider only changes in the peer group that\ncome about through changes in a student\u2019s classroom assignment over\ntime and not changes in cohort composition, as in the Hoxby and Gould\net al. studies. Including student fixed effects should exacerbate any prob-\nlems from the nonrandom assignment of teachers to classrooms high-\nlighted by Clotfelter et al. (2006). Hence, controlling for student fixed\neffects may lead to a larger upward bias in the estimates when there is\nteacher shopping. In fact, Hanushek et al. find an increase in the peer\ncoefficient when they control for individual student effects compared to\na similar specification without individual effects.\nThe previous literature finds peer effects that range from close to zero\n(Cullen et al. 2006) to about 0.5 for a one-standard-deviation change in\nPeer Effects in European Primary Schools 321\nthe peer measure (Hoxby 2000; Boozer and Cacciola 2001). The results\nof many other studies fall within this range but are clustered around the\nbottom end.\nIII. Data and Descriptive Statistics\nThirty-five countries participated in the Progress in International Read-\ning Literacy Study. This study was conducted by the International As-\nsociation for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) in 2001\nby testing 9- and 10-year-olds in reading literacy. Extensive information\non home and school environment is available from student, parent, teacher,\nand school questionnaires. With 150,000 students tested, PIRLS 2001 is\nthe first in a planned 5-year cycle of international trend studies in reading\nliteracy (Mullis et al. 2003).\nThe data are collected in a two-stage stratified sampling design. First,\nparticipating schools were chosen. Therefore, the schools are the primary\nsampling units, not the classes or students. Within each school, a sample\nof classes from the targeted grade was drawn. The targeted grade is the\nupper of the two grades with the most 9-year-olds at the time of testing.\nThis is always the fourth grade in our sample of countries. Within each\nclass, in principle, all students are sampled. In practice, the number of\nsampled students can be smaller than the actual class size because of\nstudent nonparticipation. We use all European countries with a sufficient\nnumber of schools with at least two classes. These are France, Germany,\nIceland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden.\nStudent performance is measured by test scores in reading literacy,\nwhich Campbell et al. (2001, 1) describe as \u201cone of the most important\nabilities students acquire as they progress through their early school years.\nIt is the foundation for learning across all subjects.\u201d The test scores are\nplausible values that are drawn from an estimated proficiency distribution.\nPlausible values are imputed scores based on the students\u2019 answers to the\ntest items (cf. Mislevy 1991). The scores have then been standardized to\nan international mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100, which\nfacilitates the comparison across countries. The reliability of the PIRLS\ntesting instrument across 10 versions of the test ranges from 0.83 to 0.89\nin our sample countries (Mullis et al. 2003).\nTable 1 provides information on mean reading scores and sample sizes\nin PIRLS at the student, class, and school levels. Students, classes, and\nschools can be directly identified. Missing values of student background,\nclass, and school variables are a serious problem in the data set. For\nparents\u2019 education, 36% of all values are missing. Instead of parents\u2019\neducation, we use the number of books at home as our indicator of family\nbackground. Among the variables reflecting family background, this is\nthe one with the best item response rate. In addition, this is an appealing\n322 Ammermueller\/Pischke\nTable 1\nMean Reading Scores and Sample Sizes\nGermany France Iceland Netherlands Norway Sweden\nReading score:\nAll 539.1\n(63.6)\n525.2\n(66.6)\n512.4\n(71.0)\n554.2\n(51.2)\n499.2\n(77.5)\n561.0\n(61.5)\nSample 548.6\n(59.9)\n533.7\n(64.2)\n518.6\n(68.4)\n565.2\n(51.3)\n505.0\n(76.0)\n563.1\n(61.3)\nExcluding tracked\nschools 548.6\n(59.7)\n534.2\n(65.4)\n518.7\n(68.3)\n562.8\n(53.6)\n504.4\n(76.4)\n562.8\n(61.5)\nTracked schools 549.4\n(64.2)\n532.2\n(60.5)\n506.8\n(81.0)\n568.8\n(47.5)\n529.1\n(66.5)\n570.0\n(56.6)\nNumber of students:\nAll 7,633 3,538 3,676 4,112 3,459 6,044\nSample 4,577 2,312 1,728 1,857 2,548 3,997\nIn schools with 1\n1 class 3,628 1,612 1,301 805 1,748 3,270\nNumber of schools 183 115 84 105 117 119\nNumber of schools\nwith 1 1 class 114 55 39 29 54 79\nNumber of classes 301 172 135 141 171 267\nNumber of classes\nin schools with 1\n1 class 232 112 90 65 108 227\nFraction of students\nin schools that ap-\nply tracking .067 .278 .006 .328 .035 .046\nNote.\u2014Scores are weighted by students\u2019 sampling probability; standard deviations are in parentheses.\nThe rows starting from \u201cnumber of students: sample\u201d and below refer to the sample used in the esti-\nmations.

It is highly correlated with parental income,\neducation, and origin. The variable also reflects whether the parents value\nliterary skills. Parents who own many books most likely will also promote\nreading among their children. In fact, Wo\u00a8\u00dfmann (2008) found the number\nof books to be the single most important predictor of reading skills among\nvarious family background variables in the Third International Math and\nScience Study and Ammermueller (2005) in PIRLS and the Programme\nfor International Student Assessment (PISA) data. Another advantage of\nthe books at home variable is that it is asked of both parents and students,\nallowing us to use instrumental variable (IV) estimation in order to address\npotential measurement error in the variable.\nTable 1 demonstrates that the sample size, conditioning on nonmissing\nstudent background and school variables, shrinks to about 40%\u201375% of\nthe original. The row labeled \u201cnumber of students: sample\u201d gives the sizes\nof the samples we actually use. All figures in this row and below refer\nto the sample with no missing values. Reading scores in the selected\nsamples are slightly higher than in the overall sample, as can be seen in\nthe first two rows in the table. Some sample schools have only one class.\nPeer Effects in European Primary Schools 323\nOur within-school estimates will be utilizing only the schools with two\nor more classes. Information on the students, classes, and schools with\nmore than one class can be found in the bottom rows of table 1. The\npeer effects estimations have also been performed including all observa-\ntions for which test scores are reported. Missing values have been replaced\nby zeros, and dummy variables for missing values for each variable have\nbeen added to the regressions. The estimated peer effects are comparable\nto the results presented below.\nThe home questionnaire asked parents to report the number of books\nin their home in five categories: none or few books (0\u201310), enough to fill\none shelf (11\u201325), enough to fill one bookcase (26\u2013100), enough to fill\ntwo bookcases (101\u2013200), and enough to fill three or more bookcases\n(more than 200).2 In order to form a single measure of students\u2019 back-\nground, after some experimentation, we chose a simple index that assigns\n1 to the lowest category (0\u201310) and 5 to the highest category (more than\n200). The median parent reports 26\u2013100 or 101\u2013200 books, and the means\nof the indices range from about 3.3 to 4, depending on the country (see\ntable 2 below).\nWe generated peer variables as the class average of five student back-\nground variables: number of books at home, student\u2019s sex and age,\nwhether at least one parent was born abroad, and whether a foreign\nlanguage is spoken at home. There is a discussion in the literature on peer\neffects whether classrooms or schools (or possibly even neighborhoods)\nare the more appropriate unit of peer interactions. Of course, peer in-\nteractions may occur at each of these levels, and it is an open question\nwhich is the most important. We focus on the classroom level for the\npragmatic reason that we want to analyze differences within schools. In\nthe within-school estimates, all peer interactions with students from other\nclasses in the school will be absorbed into the school fixed effects. How-\never, peer effects in the classroom are clearly of interest for academic\noutcomes, since classes are the basic unit where learning takes place. It is\ntherefore natural to expect that a large fraction of total peer effects should\narise at the classroom level.\nThe peer averages are formed using information for all students who\nreport a value for this specific variable in the data set, not just the students\nin the final sample. In table 2, we decompose the total variance in these\nclass averages into the parts of the variance within and between schools\nusing the relationship\nS C S C Ss s1 1 1\n2 2 2\u00af \u00af \u00af \u00af(x \u0002 x) p (x \u0002 x ) \u0001 C (x \u0002 x) , (4)\u0001\u0001 \u0001\u0001 \u0001cs cs s s sC C Csp1 cp1 sp1 cp1 sp1\n2 Using instead the number of books at home reported by students yields com-\nparable results.\n324 Ammermueller\/Pischke\nTable 2\nDecomposition of Variance in Class-Level Means\nGermany France Iceland Netherlands Norway Sweden\nIndex of the number of\nbooks at home:\nMean 3.49 3.32 3.99 3.36 4.03 3.91\nTotal .2401 .3138 .1480 .3922 .1542 .2643\nBetween .2098 .2726 .1220 .3629 .1297 .2174\nWithin .0303 .0412 .0259 .0293 .0245 .0469\nAge:\nTotal .0326 .0313 .0065 .0306 .0082 .0111\nBetween .0250 .0183 .0050 .0212 .0060 .0060\nWithin .0076 .0130 .0015 .0094 .0022 .0051\nFemale:\nTotal .0145 .0226 .0212 .0156 .0145 .0158\nBetween .0085 .0174 .0170 .0139 .0125 .0091\nWithin .0061 .0052 .0043 .0017 .0020 .0067\nForeign parent:\nTotal .0459 .0463 .0095 .0488 .0222 .0485\nBetween .0404 .0413 .0069 .0451 .0189 .0386\nWithin .0054 .0050 .0026 .0036 .0033 .0099\nForeign language at\nhome:\nTotal .0141 .0151 .0088 .0345 .0069 .0230\nBetween .0112 .0128 .0058 .0330 .0052 .0167\nWithin .0029 .0023 .0030 .0015 .0017 .0064\nReading test scores:\nTotal 1,144.71 1,223.61 751.93 896.62 1,075.93 1,123.78\nBetween 978.47 908.63 569.62 799.28 933.10 791.51\nWithin 166.24 314.97 182.31 97.34 142.83 332.27\nwhere x is the specific variable we are interested in, is asp 1, 2, \u2026 , S\nschool indicator, , is a class indicator, and there arecp 1, 2, \u2026 C CS S\nclasses in school s. The variable C is the total number of classes across\nall schools in our sample.3\nTable 2 presents the total, between-, and within-school variance of the\npeer variables. The variation for the average reading test score is shown\nas well. It is obvious that most of the variance in all these measures is\nbetween schools.4 Between 7% and 18% of the variance in the index for\nthe number of books at home is within schools. The fraction is higher\nfor the reading test scores. However, 70% or more of the peer variation\nin test scores is also between schools. This suggests that a large part of\nthe variation in all these measures is accounted for by school effects.\n3 For the variance decomposition to add to the total variance in an unbalanced\npanel, it is necessary to weight the between component by the number of classes\nin the sample. This is not what, e.g., the Stata xtsum command calculates.\n4 The reader thinking of individual-level variation in student performance may\nbe surprised by this. Most student-level variation is within schools. However,\nmost of this variation is also within classrooms, and we consider the variation in\nclassroom means here.\nPeer Effects in European Primary Schools 325\nNevertheless, there is also some nonnegligible amount of variance left\nwithin schools.\nIV. Selection in Classroom Formation\nIn this section we will discuss the assignment of students both between\nand within schools. We start by presenting some basic information on\nprimary schooling in the countries we study. We then go on to present\nsome evidence from the PIRLS data to shed light on the question whether\nclasses are formed (more or less) randomly and whether different class-\nrooms systematically get different resources.\nIn all six countries in our sample, students attend a single-tracked pri-\nmary school from school enrollment to at least grade 4, in which students\nhave been tested in PIRLS.5 While students are assigned to various school\ntypes after grade 4 in Germany, they stay on for at least 2 more years in\nprimary school in most other countries (France, Iceland, the Netherlands,\nand Sweden) or go on to a single-tracked secondary school (Norway).\nSchool choice at the primary level is unrestricted in some countries (Ger-\nmany and the Netherlands), whereas school assignment depends on the\nplace of residence in the other countries. However, parents have some\nmeans to influence the choice of schools also in these countries. In practice,\nmost parents choose the nearest school for convenience in all countries\n(or live near the school of their choice). The heads of the school are\nresponsible for the assignment of students to classes within schools. Most\ncountries have legal rules on maximum class size, and some school systems\nprovide extra resources for schools with a high share of immigrant stu-\ndents. The final responsibility in assigning students to classrooms lies\nwith the heads of the schools, however. Grouping of students seems to\nhappen in some cases on the basis of the migration background of stu-\ndents. Most of our sample countries do not use any explicit grouping of\nstudents by ability in primary school. The Netherlands and Sweden have\nthe most decentralized systems, and schools are relatively free to decide\nhow to form classes. In practice, students are mostly grouped by age in\nthe Netherlands, although classes are sometimes formed by proficiency\nacross age groups. In Sweden, class groups may not be fixed, and ability\ngrouping might happen for short periods of time (Mullis et al. 2002). For\nIceland, the Compulsory Schools Act of 1995 states explicitly that there\nis no selection or streaming by ability of students.6\nIn order to corroborate that these institutional descriptions translate\ninto more or less random assignment of students to classes, we conducted\n5 The information on the schooling systems is taken from Eurybase, the database\nin the information network on education in Europe (http:\/\/www.eurydice.org).\n6 We consulted researchers in each of the sample countries, and they also con-\nfirmed the impression that ability grouping would be rare.\n326 Ammermueller\/Pischke\nTable 3\nResults for Survey of Principals of German Primary Schools\nQuestion\nResponse\n(%)\nWho is responsible for forming classrooms\/allocating students to classes\nwithin a grade level at your school?\nPrincipal 86\nOther person 42\nDoes the composition of classes change during the first 4 years of\nschool?\nNo, usually not 75\nYes, class composition is rearranged in certain years 8\nYes, individual students change classes for reasons other than\nrepeating 22\nOnly under particular circumstances 39\nWhich are the rules for forming classes\/allocating students to classes in\nyour primary school?\nClasses are formed such that similar students are in the same class:\nStudents from the same neighborhood\/kindergarten 33\nStudents with similar abilities 6\nStudents with similar socioeconomic backgrounds 3\nStudents with similar migration backgrounds\/language abilities 3\nClasses are formed such that they are well mixed (e.g., by sex, age,\nabilities, etc.) 94\nClasses are formed more or less randomly 0\nClasses are formed according to other rules\/principles 3\nNote.\u2014Percentage of principals who chose the respective answer. Multiple answers were possible.\nNumber of observations is 36. The survey was sent by e-mail to 150 schools in the German cities of\nBonn, Leipzig, and Mannheim.\na small survey by e-mail among heads of primary schools in Germany.\nThe results in table 3 confirm that heads of schools are primarily re-\nsponsible for forming classrooms, often together with a teacher. The\ncomposition of classes does not usually change during the first 4 years\nof school for three-quarters of all respondents. Classes are rearranged\nmostly because of a large number of newly arriving students. Individual\nstudents who are disruptive in their current class may be allocated to\nother classes by the head of the school. Additional information from open-\nended responses provides no indication that students change classes on\ntheir behalf or for other forms of \u201cteacher shopping.\u201d Classes are actually\nmostly formed so that they are well balanced (94%). Students from the\nsame neighborhood or kindergarten are put in the same class in a third\nof all schools. Only 6% of schools mention grouping students of similar\nabilities.\nThe PIRLS data also asked in the schools questionnaire whether the\nschool forms sample classes on the basis of ability. The last row in table\n1 reports the fraction of students in schools that report some ability\ngrouping at the class level. This fraction is very low except in France and\nthe Netherlands, where it reaches on the order of 30%. While we do not\nfind much evidence that the classes in these tracked schools look very\nPeer Effects in European Primary Schools 327\ndifferent from classes in other schools, we also show results excluding\nthose schools that report some tracking.\nWe investigate two separate and distinct questions about classroom\nformation with the PIRLS data. The first, and most important, question\nis whether classes within schools are being formed randomly. The second\nquestion is whether classrooms that differ in composition, for random or\nnonrandom reasons, receive different resources.\nIn order to test whether classrooms are formed randomly with respect\nto a particular student characteristic, we perform a series of Pearson 2x\ntests. If classes are formed randomly, the student characteristic under study\nand the class the student is assigned to should be statistically independent.\nConsider student sex, for example. The Pearson test asks whether there2x\nare more females in a particular class than is consistent with independence,\ngiven the number of students in the school. Formally, for each school the\ntest statistic is given by\n2\n\u02c6(n \u0002 n )cj cjPp , (5)\u0001\u0001\nn\u02c6c j cj\nwhere is the number of students with characteristic inn jp 1, \u2026 , Jcj\nclassroom .

Then,\nunder the null hypothesis of independence, with2P \u223c x (C \u0002 1)( J\u0002 1)S\ndegrees of freedom.\nWe further assume that the S schools in a country are independent. In\nthis case, we can simply add up the S test statistics to get an aggregate\ntest statistic with degrees of freedom (see, e.g., De-[\u0001 (C \u0002 1)]( J\u0002 1)s\nGroot 1984, 384). Obviously, the test can be carried out only on the\nsubsample of schools with two or more classrooms. We found in a small\nMonte Carlo experiment that the test generally performs well, although\nit rejects somewhat too often under the null. The empirical rejection rate\nfor a 5% nominal size is about 0.13. However, the test seems to have\ngood power.7\nTable 4 presents the p-values for these tests in the first row of each\npanel for various different student characteristics. The p-values for books\nat home are well above the 5% level except for Sweden, where the p-\nvalue is 0.036 (we find such a p-value about 10% of the time in the\nsimulations under the null). We also find evidence of nonrandom assign-\n7 Details on the simulation study are available from the authors on request.\n328 Ammermueller\/Pischke\nTable 4\nTests for Independence of Peer Variable and Class Assignment and for\nAssignment of Classroom Resources\nGermany France Iceland Netherlands Norway Sweden\nIndex of the number of\nbooks at home:\nPearson x2 .2415 .3813 .7964 .7512 .0893 .0364\nF-test .4595 .2552 .0123 .3370 .5675 .0000\nAge:\nPearson x2 .0694 .2402 .1452 .0992 .0467 .6247\nF-test .0017 .2672 .0021 .0046 .0000 .9300\nFemale:\nPearson x2 .1240 .4615 .9608 .6011 .8827 .9657\nF-test .5677 .2838 .0000 .1467 .0036 .1589\nForeign language at\nhome:\nPearson x2 .0495 .6920 .1861 .4217 .4860 .0009\nF-test .0000 .4776 .0001 .0000 .0029 .0000\nNote.\u2014The rows labeled \u201cPearson x2\u201d report the p-value for Pearson x2 tests of independence between\nthe student characteristic and classroom assignment within each school using the individual-level data.\nThe rows labeled \u201cF-test\u201d report p-values of Wald tests for the joint significance of classroom resources\nin within-school regressions. See the text for details.\nment of nonnative-language children for Sweden and possibly Germany.\nRecall that principals in a significant number of schools in France and\nthe Netherlands report ability grouping in their schools. The p-values\ndiffer only slightly when we split the sample between the schools that\nreport tracking in France and the Netherlands and those that do not. One\nexception is the evidence for sorting by age within the 19 schools that\nmay be tracked in France. Overall, we conclude that there is little evidence\nof systematic formation of classrooms, particularly with respect to our\nfamily background measure books at home. Sweden might be the only\nexception.\nEven if classrooms are formed randomly, they may still differ in sys-\ntematic ways because school resources also have to be distributed to\nclasses. The assignment of classroom resources may not be random, even\nif classes are formed randomly. For example, a class may end up with\nmore children from less advantaged family backgrounds purely by chance,\nand the school might assign this class a better (or a worse) teacher. Our\nestimates of the peer effects would be biased if this happened systemat-\nically across schools.\nIn order to shed light on this question, we ran a set of regressions of\nthe peer variables described in the previous section on classroom and\nteacher characteristics. The observable characteristics of classrooms are\nclass size and its square, teacher gender, education, experience, and its\nsquare. Table 4 shows p-values for the corresponding F-tests on the joint\nsignificance of these variables from a regression including school fixed\neffects in the second row of each panel. For our family background var-\nPeer Effects in European Primary Schools 329\niable of interest, the number of books at home, the class variables are\ninsignificant except in Iceland and in Sweden. In the case of Iceland, it\nturns out that this correlation is solely driven by a single classroom with\na teacher with 20 years of experience (all other teachers in Iceland have\n10 or fewer years of experience). We discount this result as spurious. In\nthe case of Sweden this seems indeed to indicate a nonrandom allocation\nof classroom resources to classes with students from different back-\ngrounds, even within schools. In particular, there is evidence that class\nsize increases with average background of students in a class. The coef-\nficients for the other class and school variables are not significant.\nWe also find some evidence that classrooms differ for students by age\n(in Germany, Iceland, and Norway) and by student sex (in Iceland, the\nNetherlands, and Norway). It also seems fairly clear that classes are dif-\nferent for students not speaking the native language at home in most of\nour sample countries. The higher the share of immigrant students in a\nclass, the lower teacher\u2019s education in Germany and Norway. In Sweden,\nthere is weak evidence of an allocation of immigrant students to larger\nclasses.\nOur results largely confirm that classes in the sample countries seem\nto be formed roughly randomly within schools. There is little evidence\nthat students of different family backgrounds are more likely to be\ngrouped in certain classes conditional on the school they attend or that\nclasses with different compositions receive different (observable) re-\nsources. This is comforting for our analysis. The only country for which\nthis does not seem to be the case is Sweden. Hence, the Swedish results\nmay have to be taken with a grain more of salt. But the Swedish results\nturn out to be very close to the average of the other countries, so this\ndoes not seem to matter for our findings in practice. In addition, im-\nmigrant children, which are an important group in all the sample countries,\nalso seem to be nonrandomly assigned and given different teaching re-\nsources. Nevertheless, we do not find any evidence that the nonrandom\nsorting of immigrant children to classes affects our results on the books\nat home variable.\nV. Basic Results on Peer Effects\nWe now turn to our results on peer effects. Table 5 summarizes the\nresults for the six countries. Our family background and peers variable,\nbooks at home, takes on five values. The most flexible way to use this\nvariable is to create a set of four dummy variables and, correspondingly,\nthe fraction of peers in these four categories. Since this leads to a large\nnumber of coefficients and given that the coefficient estimates are roughly\nmonotonically increasing in the categories, we have chosen to simply\ncreate an index taking on the values 1\u20135, which we created from these\n330 Ammermueller\/Pischke\nTable 5\nRegressions for Reading Test Score on Peer Composition\nCountry (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)\nGermany 17.97\n(3.04)\n17.66\n(3.03)\n18.83\n(3.83)\n6.13\n(6.24)\n7.22\n(6.40)\nFrance 22.23\n(3.05)\n22.84\n(2.91)\n25.67\n(3.94)\n22.20\n(9.12)\n17.80\n(12.58)\nIceland 18.08\n(5.77)\n19.97\n(5.04)\n22.75\n(5.58)\n12.14\n(11.17)\n8.81\n(11.18)\nNetherlands 17.58\n(4.30)\n19.70\n(4.37)\n22.72\n(6.99)\n.71\n(8.59)\n9.56\n(9.93)\nNorway 15.46\n(7.33)\n9.84\n(7.42)\n12.73\n(7.85)\n\u00023.20\n(8.13)\n\u00022.77\n(8.24)\nSweden 18.98\n(3.84)\n18.04\n(4.10)\n21.94\n(3.75)\n11.51\n(6.70)\n11.08\n(7.22)\nAverage across countries 19.17\n(1.61)\n19.40\n(1.59)\n21.65\n(1.92)\n7.65\n(3.22)\n7.59\n(3.48)\nStudent-level variables \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\nClass-level variables \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\nSchool-level variables \u0002 \u0002\nOnly schools with 1 1 class \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\nSchool fixed effects \u0002 \u0002\nExclude tracked schools \u0002\nNote.\u2014Weighted least squares regressions using students\u2019 sampling probability as weight.

The size of the estimated peer effect is similar across\nthe specifications with and without school- and class-level variables and\nis on the order of 15\u201322 for moving peer quality to the next higher\ncategory. Only in Norway does the peer coefficient fall when school-\nlevel covariates are added to the regression. Once we include school fixed\neffects in column 4, the effect always falls, although the amount of the\nchange is different across countries. In Germany, the Netherlands, and\nNorway the peer effect weakens the most in these specifications, whereas\nthere is little change in France. Excluding schools that form classes on\nthe basis of student ability predictably changes the results only in France\nand the Netherlands, the two countries with moderate shares of students\nin schools that form classes on the basis of ability (see table 1). Curiously,\n8 We also experimented with assigning midpoints to the categories to form an\nalternative cardinal variable, with roughly similar results.\nPeer Effects in European Primary Schools 331\nestimated peer effects are larger when the schools that report tracking are\nexcluded for the Netherlands.\nOne reason for the high variation in the coefficients from the fixed-\neffects models is that the standard errors of these estimates are reasonably\nlarge, so that the effects for each individual country cannot be estimated\nvery precisely. If we believe that the peer effects are the same in each\ncountry, then it makes sense to combine the estimates into a single esti-\nmate. The average of the six coefficients in the fixed-effects specification\nin column 4, weighted by the inverse of the sampling variance, is 7.6. If\nthe variation in country-level estimates around this overall mean is due\nonly to sampling variation, then the standard error for the meta-estimate\nis 3.2.9 This estimate is much more precise than the country-level estimates,\nand it is significant at the 5% level. One concern is with the results for\nSweden, because we found some evidence for nonrandom assignment and\ntargeted classroom resources for Sweden above. The meta-estimate for\nthe countries without Sweden is only slightly lower.\nOur results show that standard OLS estimates of the peer effect may\nbe biased upward substantially if the within-school results are indeed\nreliable estimates of the true peer effect. One reason why even the fixed-\neffects estimates may be biased is the presence of immigrant children. We\nshowed above that immigrant children are often not randomly assigned\nto classes within schools, and the classes with many immigrant children\nmay get different resources. Since immigrants in these countries tend to\nbe of lower socioeconomic status (the index for books at home is on\naverage 3.15 for immigrant families in the six countries but 3.56 for non-\nimmigrant families), part of the peer effect may be explained by the non-\nrandom allocation of immigrants.\nIn order to probe this, we reran the regressions in table 5 including\nthe fraction of foreign-born children in the class and the fraction of chil-\ndren speaking a foreign language at home. This attenuates the estimated\npeer effects at most very slightly.10 We also experimented with regressions\non the subsample of schools with few immigrant children. However, most\nsample countries have enough immigrants that there are relatively few\nsuch schools, leading to small samples and hence imprecise estimates.\nThese results indicate that the effect of immigrant children in a class seems\nto be relatively well captured by our family background variable.\nA further question is whether peer effects vary across students. This\n9 The sampling variance of the mean is obtained as , where is\u00021 \u00021vp (\u0001 v ) vc c\nthe sampling variance of the estimate for country c. One interpretation of this\ncalculation is that the country average is the minimum distance estimate of the\ncommon peer effect across countries.\n10 Including measures from the school questionnaire on the share of econom-\nically disadvantaged students or the share of students leaving before the end of\nthe academic year as alternative school-level variables did not change the results.\n332 Ammermueller\/Pischke\nTable 6\nRegressions for Reading Test Score on Peer Composition and Interactions\nwith Individual Family Background\nCountry\n(1) (2) (3)\nPeer\nEffect Interaction\nPeer\nEffect Interaction\nPeer\nEffect Interaction\nGermany 17.58\n(3.03)\n.82\n(1.04)\n5.92\n(6.21)\n.55\n(1.08)\n7.09\n(6.37)\n.34\n(1.11)\nFrance 20.94\n(3.12)\n2.46\n(1.43)\n21.37\n(9.01)\n1.36\n(1.68)\n16.01\n(11.98)\n3.02\n(2.24)\nIceland 17.32\n(5.82)\n1.43\n(1.66)\n11.67\n(11.31)\n.76\n(1.87)\n8.66\n(11.41)\n.24\n(1.83)\nNetherlands 17.74\n(4.49)\n\u0002.34\n(1.36)\n\u0002.50\n(8.90)\n2.53\n(1.53)\n8.23\n(9.79)\n3.21\n(1.34)\nNorway 15.35\n(7.58)\n.16\n(1.76)\n\u00023.71\n(8.13)\n.94\n(1.69)\n\u00023.43\n(8.26)\n1.18\n(1.76)\nSweden 19.91\n(3.94)\n\u00021.35\n(1.14)\n11.85\n(6.99)\n\u0002.41\n(1.19)\n11.59\n(7.22)\n\u0002.60\n(1.22)\nAverage across\ncountries 18.81\n(1.64)\n.38\n(.54)\n7.30\n(3.26)\n.77\n(.58)\n7.31\n(3.46)\n.95\n(.59)\nStudent-level\nvariables \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\nOnly schools with 1\n1 class \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\nSchool fixed effects \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\nExclude tracked\nschools \u0002 \u0002\nNote.\u2014Weighted least squares regressions using students\u2019 sampling probability as weight.

Since about half the students have more than 100 books at\nhome, we interact the peer average with a dummy indicating whether the\nindividual reports more than 100 books at home. The results are presented\nin table 6. Peer effects seem to be stronger for students with a higher\nsocial background in France and the Netherlands, and they are stronger\nfor students with a lower social background in Sweden. The meta-estimate\nof the interaction is small and insignificant.\nPeer Effects in European Primary Schools 333\nVI. Measurement Error and Missing Students\nSurvey reports are subject to a lot of measurement error. In our case,\nmeasurement error in the books at home variable implies that there is\nmeasurement error in both the individual- and the peer-level regressors.\nIn addition, the peer measure is not based on all students in a class because\nsome students have not been sampled and others have not responded to\nthe respective question. This problem will also arise in many studies based\non administrative data, which frequently use lagged test scores as a peer\nmeasure, since test taking may be incomplete or lagged scores cannot be\nmatched to all students. Both these measurement problems will interact\nin leading to biased estimates of the peer effect in a nonstandard way.\nIn order to investigate the impact of measurement error in our setup,\nwe will return to the model we outlined in equations (1)\u2013(3) above. In\norder to focus on the variables of interest, consider a simplified version\nof equation (1) with only the individual-level and the peer group regres-\nsors but no other covariates:\ny p bX \u0001 lX \u0001 e . (6)ics ics ics(\u0002i)cs\nMoreover, to focus on the role of measurement error, we set ; thatm p 0cs\nis, the error term has no class- or school-level component. Hence we\nabstract from the biases arising from correlated effects. In practice, these\nmight of course exist on top of any biases from measurement error.\nThe student background variable is still given by equation (2), butXics\nthis variable is not directly observed. Instead we observe\n\u02dcX p X \u0001 u p h \u0001 v \u0001 u , (7)ics ics ics cs ics ics\nwhere is a classical measurement error. Moreover, the observed peeruics\nvariable is computed only from the subset of observed peers, whereas\nstudents are actually affected by all peers in (6).\nWe do not assume that students are missing at random. Instead our\nderivations assume that the for missing students are drawn from avics\ndistribution that may differ from the distribution for the observed stu-\ndents, but this distribution is independent of classroom assignment or of\n. This allows for the possibility, for example, that the probability of ae ics\nstudent being missing depends on his or her background characteristics.11\nOur argument above has been that the common component of student\nbackground, , arises only at the school level. Hence, we can think ofhcs\nour standard OLS results corresponding to those with and the2j 1 0h\n11 Sojourner\u2019s (2008) work and discussions with the author first alerted us to\nthe possibility that assumptions weaker than missing at random are feasible when\nstudents are (quasi) randomly assigned to classrooms.\n334 Ammermueller\/Pischke\nwithin-school results to because this component has been absorbed2j p 0h\nby the fixed effects.\nIn this setup, the OLS estimate of l will converge to\n2 2\u00af(n\u0002 1)j ju h\n\u02c6pliml p bOLS 2 2 2 2 2\u00af(j \u0001 j )(nj \u0001 j \u0001 j )v u h v u\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2\u00af \u00af[(n\u0002 1)\/(N\u0002 1)]j (j \u0001 j \u0001 j )\u0001 (n\u0002 1)j (j \u0001 j )v h v u h v u\n\u0001 l , (8)2 2 2 2 2\u00af(j \u0001 j )(nj \u0001 j \u0001 j )v u h v u\nas we show in the appendix. The term is the average number of studentsN\nin a classroom, is the average number of students sampled in each class,n\u00af\nand all the variances refer to the distributions of the relevant variables in\nthe subpopulation of observed students.\nIn order to understand the different sources of measurement error and\nthe sign of the bias, it is instructive to look at some special cases. First,\nconsider the case in which all students in each class are sampled, so the\nonly problem is classical measurement error. In this case,\n2 2(N\u0002 1)j ju h\n\u02c6pliml p bOLS 2 2 2 2 2(j \u0001 j )(Nj \u0001 j \u0001 j )v u h v u\n2 2 2 2 2 2j (Nj \u0001 j \u0001 j )\u0001 (N\u0002 1)j jv h v u h u\n\u0001 l .

ThisXics\nmeasurement error will carry over to and lead to the standardX(\u0002i)cs\nattenuation. Since l is likely positive, this will imply an underestimate of\nl. From equation (8), it becomes clear that the attenuation is greater when\nsome students in the class are not sampled. If , a second component2j 1 0h\nof the bias arises, and this is captured by the first term in equation (8)\nor (9). The individual-level regressor is also subject to error, whichXics\nwill lead to an attenuation of the estimated . Since the peer variable\u02c6b\ncontains information on , part of the signal in the individual-levelX hcs(\u0002i)cs\nregressor will load onto the peer coefficient. This term is positive and\nhence yields an upward bias.\nBecause of these two conflicting sources of bias, it is impossible to tell\nwhat the net effect of the bias on is. The first term can dominate\u02c6lOLS\nwhen b is sufficiently large compared to l. Hence measurement error\nmay not lead to an underestimate of the peer effect in the standard OLS\nspecification.\nPeer Effects in European Primary Schools 335\nThe within-school model corresponds to the case in which , the2j p 0h\nfirst term in equations (8) and (9) vanishes, and we have\n2n\u00af\u0002 1 jv\n\u02c6pliml p l , (10)W ( ) 2 2j \u0001 jN\u0002 1 v u\nso that the peer effect is now underestimated.

It\ntends to be difficult to interpret the magnitudes of the peer effect estimate\nin any case. One way to facilitate this interpretation is to look at this\nratio.\nThe more standard way to address the measurement error problem is\nto rely on instruments for both and . Recall that in our case theX Xics (\u0002i)cs\nbackground variable is the parents\u2019 report of the number of booksXics\nat home. The same question was asked of the students as well, so we use\nthe students\u2019 report of the number of books at home as our instrument\nfor the parents\u2019 report and the peer mean of the students\u2019 report as an\ninstrument for the peer variable. Of course, the errors in parents\u2019 and\nstudents\u2019 reports may well be correlated. Nevertheless, using independent\nreports by different individuals on the same variable and assuming in-\ndependent errors are a standard strategy in the literature when such mea-\nsures are available (see, e.g., Ashenfelter and Krueger 1994). We therefore\npursue this avenue here as well.\nIn the classical measurement error case with an unbounded support for\n, the IV estimate of l will converge toXics\n2 2Nj \u0001 jh vn\u00af\u0002 1\n\u02c6pliml p l .

It does2j p 0u\nnot resolve the attenuation in the peer effect that arises because we do\nnot sample all the students in a class. For the within estimator, equation\n(12) becomes\nn\u00af\u0002 1\n\u02c6pliml p l . (13)IV,W ( )N\u0002 1\nThis again suggests that the within-school IV estimate is simple to adjust\nfor the sampling bias using the actual means and in our data. Our\u00afN n\nadjusted IV estimator will therefore be\nN\u0002 1\n\u02c6 \u02c6l p l . (14)( )IVadj IV n\u00af\u0002 1\nThe first stages corresponding to our IV regressions indicate that the\nrelevant instruments both for the individual-level regressor and for the\npeer variable are always highly significant. The t-statistics on the students\u2019\nreport of books at home are above 7 and typically above 10, and the\ncorresponding F-statistics are also large.12 This indicates that our IV mod-\nels are not likely to suffer from any small-sample bias.\nOne important caveat to these derivations is of course that our back-\nground and peer variable, books at home, is categorical and hence has\nbounded support. In this case, measurement error will by necessity be\nnonclassical. Moreover, Kane, Rouse, and Staiger (1999) point out that\nthe IV estimator is biased upward when the mismeasured regressor is\nbinary. The same will be true if the regressor is multivalued but bounded.\nFor our application this implies that the IV estimates may actually be\nbiased upward. In this case, once we control for school fixed effects, OLS\nand IV would bracket the true result. However, as we discussed above,\nmistakes in parents\u2019 and children\u2019s reports of books at home may be\ncorrelated. This would bias the IV estimates toward OLS, and the true\npeer effect could therefore be larger than the IV result.\nBefore we turn to our results, it is important to point out that Sojourner\n(2008), in an independent and complementary analysis, also considers the\nestimation of peer effects with missing students.13 His setup allows for\nmore general processes that generate missing students. In particular, So-\njourner\u2019s results are valid under our assumptions and random assignment\n12 The only exception is the Netherlands, where the instrument for the peer\nvariable has a t-statistic of 3.15.\n13 This problem has also been recognized by Altonji (1988), although his ap-\nproach does not solve it completely.\nPeer Effects in European Primary Schools 337\nTable 7\nOLS and IV Regressions for Reading Test Score on Books at Home and\nPeer Composition\nIndependent Variable (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)\nA.

However,\nwe do not have a formal proof for this conjecture.\n338 Ammermueller\/Pischke\nfrom the student questionnaire. We also present estimates for the ratio of\nthe peer effect and the individual effect. The table displays only averages\nover all our six countries.15\nInstrumenting the individual-level index of books at home more than\ndoubles the coefficient in all specifications. This may suggest a large\namount of measurement error in the books at home variable. It could\nalso imply that the IV estimate is biased upward because the regressor\nand instrument have bounded support.\nMore interestingly, the coefficient on the peer variable does not increase\nin the IV specifications when only student- and class-level variables are\nincluded (cols. 1 and 2), and, in fact, it falls slightly. This is consistent\nwith our discussion of equations (8), (9), and (12) above. Measurement\nerror in the peer regressor may actually lead to an upward bias in the\nOLS specifications if , as can be seen in equation (8). Moreover, the2j 1 0h\nratio of the coefficient on the peer effect and the individual effect is around\n1.5. This is much too large to be believable and further underscores that\nthese estimates are likely subject to bias from measurement error (and\/\nor correlated effects).16\nThings are very different when we go to the within-school specification\nin column 3. The coefficient on the individual-level regressor changes\nlittle compared to that in column 2, whereas the coefficient on the peer\nvariable falls to a third in the OLS specification. This is consistent with\nthe comparison of equations (8) and (10). The within specification removes\nthe first (positive) bias term in (8), and it exacerbates the standard atten-\nuation bias by removing the potentially important variance component\n. In the IV results, however, the coefficient on the peer variable is fairly2jh\nsimilar to that in column 2. A comparison of equations (12) and (13)\nsuggests that the IV coefficient should fall going to the within estimate.\nHowever, our result could easily be due to sampling variation. Overall,\nwe conclude that the relative stability of the IV estimates across columns\n15 The averages for the peer and individual effects are obtained as before. The\nratio is estimated as the ratio of the country averages (rather than the average of\nthe ratios for each country). This is the efficient estimate under the assumption\nthat the underlying coefficients are the same in each country, and we want to\nrecover this common coefficient. The estimate of the ratio will also generally be\nbiased in small samples (because of the sampling error and Jensen\u2019s inequality).\nThis bias will be minimized by taking averages first and then forming the ratio.\n16 It may seem curious that the standard error for the ratio of the peer and\nindividual effects is smaller for the IV estimates in cols. 1 and 2 than for the\ncorresponding OLS estimates (although the standard errors on the coefficients\nfor the individual and peer books variables go up in the IV estimation compared\nto OLS). This results from the fact that the coefficient for the individual-level\neffect goes up in the IV results, and this coefficient enters the denominator of the\nstandard error calculation.\nPeer Effects in European Primary Schools 339\nis more consistent with an explanation based on measurement error than\none based on correlated effects.\nThe ratio of the peer effect to the individual effect is now in the range\nof 0.6\u20130.7. This is more sensible since we expect the peer effect to be\nsmaller than the individual effect, although it still reflects a large estimate\nof the peer effect. Moreover, the OLS and IV estimates of the ratio in\ncolumn 3 are now fairly similar. This is what we expect from equations\n(11) and (13). The IV estimate is slightly higher than the OLS one. This\nis consistent with the idea that our IV estimates are biased upward because\nthe regressor and instrument have bounded support. This reasoning would\nsuggest that the OLS estimate of the ratio might be the more reliable one\nthan the IV estimate. Of course, the estimates in column 3 are still biased\nbecause not all students are sampled.\nWe therefore implement the correction for the sampling bias as sug-\ngested in equations (11) and (14) in column 4.17 This affects both the peer\neffects estimate and the estimate of the ratio. The estimates are about 30%\nhigher, indicating potentially substantial peer effects. As before, excluding\ntracked schools in column 5 makes little difference to the results. Our\nbest estimate for the ratio of the peer and individual effects is therefore\naround 0.75, which is substantial.\nWe have tried to argue that the allocation of students into classrooms\nwithin schools is approximately random. Nevertheless, it is not possible\nto rule out some sorting of students in practice. Could our results have\nbeen generated simply by sorting of students while true peer effects are\nzero? It is impossible to rule out this possibility completely. This results\nfrom the fact that a general enough model of student achievement has\nenough free parameters to generate both the test results for random as-\nsignment in table 4 and the regression results in tables 5\u20137. In particular,\na very small classroom-level variance component (relative to the2jh\nindividual-level component ), which is highly correlated with the class-2jv\nroom-level shock , combined with a commensurate individual-level ef-2jm\nfect on the background variable , can generate all of our result. SinceXics\nthis combination of parameter values occupies a small region close to (but\nnot on) the boundary of the feasible parameter space, it strikes us as rather\nunlikely.18\nVII. Effect Sizes\nOf course, even if we identify a positive peer effect, one might ask\nwhether we care much about the precise magnitude of the coefficient on\n17 The adjustment for sampling bias is applied to the individual country estimates\nof the peer effects before taking country averages.\n18 Detailed derivations of these claims and power calculations from a simulation\nstudy are available from the authors on request.\n340 Ammermueller\/Pischke\nTable 8\nEffect Sizes\nCountry\nSD Test\nScore jy\n(1)\nSD Peer\nVariable\nj \u02dcX\n(2)\nSD Peer\nVariable\nAdjusted jX\n(3)\nPeer\nEffect \u02c6l\n(4)\nEffect Size\n\u02c6j l\/jX y\n(5)\nPeer Effect\/\nIndividual\nEffect\n(6)\nGermany 60.00 .459 .362 23.90 .144 .52\nFrance 65.45 .646 .539 60.62 .499 2.11\nIceland 67.58 .348 .251 \u00022.17 \u0002.008 1.47\nNetherlands 56.46 .678 .532 \u000225.00 \u0002.236 .15\nNorway 77.12 .372 .301 3.05 .012 \u0002.24\nSweden 61.50 .461 .400 30.83 .201 1.34\nAverage across\ncountries 64.68 .494 .397 26.97 .166 .77\nNote.\u2014Column 3 is the square root of the covariance between the peer variables index of books at\nhome taken from the student and the home questionnaire.

The results in\ncol. 6 are calculated as the ratio of the peer coefficient to the individual coefficient from the OLS\nregressions in col. 4 in table 7.\nthe peer variable. Books at home is at best a fairly imperfect proxy for\nthe family background of peers. Hence, we may care more about statistical\nsignificance than the actual magnitudes. But this strikes us as an overly\npessimistic view. We will therefore proceed to use three different methods\nto assess the economic magnitude of the effects.\nIt is common in the literature to report effect sizes of the peer effects\nestimates, so this helps to facilitate comparisons with other studies using\ndifferent peer measures. Effect sizes are typically calculated as ,\u02c6j l\/jX y\nwhere is the within-country variation in the peer variable and is thej jX y\nwithin-country variation in the test scores. This quantifies the peer effect\nas the impact of a one-standard-deviation change in peer background in\nterms of individual-level standard deviations of the outcome variable.\nOne complication with this measure in our context is that the standard\ndeviation of the peer variable is not an unbiased measure of becausejX\nof the measurement error. However, since we have both the parents\u2019 and\nthe children\u2019s reports for books at home, the covariance of the two is a\nmeasure of the variance of the true variable if both reports are subject\nonly to uncorrelated classical measurement errors. Both our estimate of\nand the IV estimate of therefore rely on the classical measurement\u02c6j lX\nerror model being a good approximation in our case and the parents\u2019 and\nchildren\u2019s reports being uncorrelated.\nWe report the effect size measure and the necessary ingredients in table\n8. As before, the effect sizes vary quite widely across countries. The\nvariation in effect sizes comes almost exclusively from variation in the\npeer coefficients. The average effect size across countries is 0.17. This is\nlarger than most of the estimates in the literature. The bulk of the reported\neffect sizes are in the range of 0.05\u20130.10. Our estimate is at the upper end\nPeer Effects in European Primary Schools 341\nof that range but well below the highest estimates reported in studies by\nHoxby (2000), Boozer and Cacciola (2001), and McEwan (2003).\nAnother way to gauge the size of our estimates is to compare them\nto the effect of a well-known alternative intervention. For this com-\nparison we picked the change in class size in the Tennessee STAR ex-\nperiment, as reported by Krueger (1999). Krueger reports a class size\neffect of \u00020.81 per student in third grade (his table 7), which is closest\nto the age group in our study. This corresponds to an effect size for a\nchange in class size by one student of about 0.03. A one-standard-\ndeviation change in peer composition therefore corresponds to a change\nin class size by about five students. This suggests to us that our estimate\nis fairly large in comparison.\nOf course, the size of the peer effect estimate also depends on how\nwell our family background measure actually captures the relevant char-\nacteristics of students. It is therefore useful to compare the peer coefficient\nto the individual-level coefficient as we have done already in table 7. If\nbooks at home are a good predictor of reading success, then the coefficient\non own books at home will be larger and the peer coefficient will also\nbe larger, and vice versa. Column 6 in table 8 reports the ratio of the two.\nThe average based on the OLS results is 0.77, indicating that the estimate\nof the peer effect is large compared to the estimate of the individual-level\neffect, since we would expect peers\u2019 background to matter much less than\nown background. One drawback of this comparison is that it depends\non what other variables are controlled for in the regression. For example,\nsome studies in the literature control for multiple family background\ncharacteristics at the individual level. This makes a comparison across\nstudies very difficult.\nOne reason why our estimates seem relatively large might be that we\nare careful about the measurement error in the peer effects variable. How-\never, adjusting for measurement error lowers the estimate of and raisesjX\nthe estimate of , so this cuts two ways. However, the upward adjustment\u02c6l\nin is much more important. Calculating the effect size on the basis of\u02c6l\nthe estimates ignoring measurement error yields a value of only 0.06,\nabout a third of the size of our IV results. Hence, the treatment of mea-\nsurement error may be rather important, particularly in studies based on\nsurvey data, such as Schindler Rangvid (2007) and Schneeweis and Winter-\nEbmer (2007). A further explanation for the large effect sizes could be\nthat we estimate the cumulative impact of peers if classroom composition\nis fixed over the previous 4 years and not the incremental effect of a value-\nadded specification. We should also point out that our confidence intervals\nare fairly large because the within-school and IV estimates are relatively\nnoisy.\n342 Ammermueller\/Pischke\nVIII. Conclusion\nPeer effects are potentially a major input into the process of educational\nproduction but are difficult to estimate empirically. We estimate peer\neffects across classes within primary schools and argue that classes within\nschools are formed randomly with respect to family background. We find\nthat a one-standard-deviation change in our student background measure\nof peer composition leads to a 0.17-standard-deviation change in reading\ntest scores of fourth graders across our sample of six European countries.\nThis is slightly larger than most previous estimates in the literature. The\nindividual country estimates are relatively noisy so that we feel that most\nis learned from the country averages. For Sweden, the estimated effects\nare not different from the average for the other countries, although we\nfound some evidence that students may not be randomly allocated to\nclasses in Sweden.\nWe have argued that there is little evidence for systematic sorting into\nclassrooms within schools for the other countries and for different classes\nreceiving different observable instructional resources. Hence, comparing\nstudents in different classes within schools should be an effective way of\ndealing with any selection at the school level. Surprisingly, we find that\nthis selection does not seem to be very important once we take mea-\nsurement error issues into account. We have argued that the within-school\nestimator solves the measurement error problem when we look at the\nratio of the peer effect and the individual effect. The OLS and within-\nschool results alone are consistent with an explanation based either on\nselection of students into schools and correlated effects at the school level\nor on measurement error because the estimated peer effects drop sub-\nstantially when we go from the across-school to the within-school results.\nAs an alternative to the OLS results we also present IV estimates. Unlike\nthe OLS estimator, the IV estimator solves the measurement error problem\nin the case of both the across-school and the within-school regressions.\nThe IV results are very similar regardless of whether we introduce school\nfixed effects. This is consistent with a measurement error explanation but\nnot with a role for correlated effects at the school level. The discussion\nin this literature seems dominated with solving the selection issues,\nwhereas little attention is being paid to the measurement error and sam-\npling issues, which we find to be important in our data.\nAppendix\nWe are interested in estimating equation (6) in the text,\ny p bX \u0001 lw \u0001 e , (A1)ics ics cs ics\nPeer Effects in European Primary Schools 343\nwhere is the peer effect.
