An essential step in \nthe development of such approaches is the validation of their predictions. The ERICA \nIntegrated Approach (Beresford et al. 2007a; Larson et al. 2008) was applied to a \nnumber of case studies to test various of its elements (from user friendliness of \ndocumentation to comparison of predictions to measurements in a range of \necosystems) during the course of its development (Beresford et al. 2007b; Wood et al. \nin 2008). This paper describes the results of one of these case study assessments. \n1.1 The ERICA-Tool \nThe ERICA-Tool (Brown et al. in 2008) is the software implementing the \nERICA Integrated Approach (Beresford et al. 2007a; Larsson et al. 2008). The \nassessment element of the ERICA Integrated Approach is organised in three separate \ntiers. The first of these (Tier 1) is a simple, conservative screening tier which \ncompares input media (water, sediment, soil or air) activity concentrations to \npredefined environmental media concentration limits (the concentration which would \nresult in a dose-rate to the most exposed organism equal to the screening dose-rate). \nTier 2 allows the user to be more interactive, for instance, user defined organisms can \nbe created and default transfer parameters changed. Outputs of a Tier 2 analysis \ninclude biota whole-body activity concentrations and dose rates (internal, external and \ntotal).  Tier 3 allows the user to additionally run the assessment probabilistically. In \nboth Tiers 2 and 3 the user can select a default concentration ratio (CR) database to \nestimate biota whole-body activity concentrations from input media activity \nconcentrations (the CR databases are described within Beresford et al. (2008) and \nHosseini et al. (2008)); Tier 3 also contains default probability distribution functions \nfor each CR. For the purposes of this paper the CR for terrestrial ecosystems is \ndefined as:  \n \n)dry weight kg (Bq soilin ion concentratActivity \nht)fresh weig kg (Bqbody - wholebiotain ion concentratActivity \n  CR\n1-\n-1\n \n \nBoth Tiers 2 and 3 also allow the user to input biota whole-body activity \nconcentrations if they are available.  \nThe relationship between the activity concentration of an organism or media and \ninternal or external absorbed dose rates is described by the dose conversion \ncoefficient (DCC; \u03bcGy h-1 per Bq kg-1 fresh weight). The methodology used to derive \nDCC values within the ERICA-Tool is described by Ulanovsky et al. (2008).  \nTier 2 predicts both \u2018best estimate\u2019 and \u2018conservative\u2019 dose rates. The best \nestimate is derived from user input data and mean transfer parameter values (if the \ndefault database is used). The conservative dose rate is defined as being equivalent to \na specified percentile of the dose rate. This is calculated by applying a default \nuncertainty factor of three (for 95\nth\n percentile) or five (for 99\nth\n percentile) to the \ncalculated best estimate value (see Brown et al. (2008) for a more complete \ndescription).  \n \n 4 \n1.2 Objectives of the Chernobyl small mammal case study \nThe work described here tested elements of Tiers 2 and 3 of the ERICA-Tool. In \nparticular the objectives were to: \n test the predictions of the activity concentrations from the ERICA-Tool \nagainst field based measurements; and \n compare absorbed dose rate predictions with measured dose rates. \nTo achieve this, a field study was specifically undertaken to provide measurements of \nexternal dose rates received by animals within contaminated environments as such \ndose rate validation data are sparse in the scientific literature. \n \n2 Materials and Methods \n \n2.1 Study sites and determination of soil activity concentrations \nThree forest sites, anticipated to have differing soil radionuclide activity \nconcentrations, were selected in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. The sites will be \nreferred to throughout as Low, Medium and High on the basis of their anticipated soil \nactivity concentrations. At each site a 100 m x 100 m study area was marked out using \nposts at 10 m intervals. These were subsequently used as the location of small animal \ntraps.   \nThe Low site was located approximately 8.5 km south-east of the Chernobyl \nreactor number 4 (Figure 1). The dominant tree species at this site was Pinus \nsylvestris (Scots pine) with few deciduous trees. Most of the 10 000 m\n2 \nstudy area had \nsparse understorey vegetation although the eastern part had complete ground cover \ndominated by graminaceous species. The soils at this site was primarily soddy \npseudopodzolic with some podzolic-sandy and loamy sand gleys on fluvio-glacial \ndeposits. The High and Medium sites were approximately 5 km and 8 km respectively \nto the west of the Chernobyl power plant complex (Figure 1). The Medium site \nconsisted of mainly P. sylvestris and Quercus robur (Oak) with some Sorbus \naucuparia (Rowan) and Tilia platyphyllos (Large leaved lime), the sparse understorey \nvegetation included Pteridium aquilinum (Bracken). The site had soddy \npseudopodzolic sandy and boggy soils on modern alluvial deposits. The High site was \ndominated by Betula spp., with few coniferous trees present (this area was a young \nconiferous plantation at the time of the Chernobyl accident and the majority of \nconiferous trees were killed). The site had a ground cover consisting predominantly of \ngraminaceous species throughout, although ericaceous species, such as Calluna \nvulgaris (Heather), were also present.  Bog peat and soddy pseudopodzolic sandy soil \npredominated at the High site. \nGamma-kerma rates were determined at 5 cm above ground surface at each \ntrapping point using a MKS\u201301R\u201301 dose rate meter with a BDKB-01R detector. A \nstand was used to achieve the same height at each point and the mean of three 10s \nmeasurements was recorded. The location of each trapping point was determined \nusing a handheld GPS. \nUsing a random sampling scheme, 23 soil samples were collected from each \nsite. Samples were taken to a depth of 10 cm and sampling locations recorded using a \nhandheld GPS. The soil sampling area was extended to 50 m beyond the trapping area \n 5 \nto encompass the likely home ranges of the species being trapped (The Mammal \nSociety, 2007). Samples were subsequently, dried and homogenised. Sub-samples \nwere analysed on hyper-pure (Canberra-Packard) germanium detectors to determine \nthe activity concentration of gamma-emitting radionuclides, spectra were analysed \nusing the Canberra-Packard Genie-2000 software package. Count times were such \nthat an error of <20 % on the \n40\nK estimate was achieved. For samples from the \nMedium and Low sites the mass analysed was approximately 750 g dry weight (DW) \nper sample whilst that for the High site was approximately 130 g DW per sample.  \nThe \n238,239,240\nPu activity concentrations soils were determined in 10 g DW sub-\nsamples using the method described by Bondarkov et al. (2002a). This method is \nbased on measurement of the Lx - radiation (13-23 keV) emitted from excited uranium \ndaughter isotopes following the \u03b1-decay of 238-240Pu. The method includes an \nabsorption correction based on the self-absorption of Kx -radiation of Barium (32-37 \nkeV) which is a daughter isotope of \n137\nCs. Previous studies have shown good \ncorrelation between the Lx method and measurements using standard radiochemistry, \nand a detection limit of 3-5 Bq Bondarkov et al. (2002a).  The accuracy of the method \nis 10-15%. \nStrontium-90 activity concentrations in soils were determined in 10 g DW sub-\nsamples via the measurement of \n90\nY activity concentrations using a thin-film (1 mm) \nNaI scintillation detector as described by Bondarkov et al. (2002b; 2002c); calibration \nof the method for soil samples is presented by Bondarkov et al. (2002c).  \n2.2 Small mammal trapping, whole-body counting and TLDs \nTrapping was conducted on 14 occasions from early July to mid-August 2005. \nOne hundred Sherman humane traps were placed over each sampling area (at the \nmarker posts described above) and baited with rolled oats in the late evening. Traps \nwere revisited early the following day and any animals caught were transported to a \nlaboratory in the town of Chernobyl. The trapping location of each animal was \nrecorded. Only Apodemus flavicollis (Yellow-necked mouse), Clethrionomys \nglareolus (Bank vole) and Microtus spp. (Vole species) were processed for this study.  \nThe first time an animal was caught it was fitted with a numbered collar to \nwhich a LiF-100 thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) (Global Dosimetry Solutions Inc., \nCalifornia) had been attached. The collar comprised a 4 mm wide cable-tie; the TLD \nwas attached to this using electrician\u2019s tape having first been covered in a single layer \nof 200 gauge polythene. The live-weight of the animal was recorded and its whole-\nbody \n137\nCs and \n90\nSr content determined using the method described by Bondarkov et \nal. (2002b; 2002d). The animals were placed in a small, disposable, cardboard box \n(70x40x40 mm) the upper side of which was made from <0.1 mm thick polyethylene \nprior to whole-body counting. The box was then placed inside a lead shielded \ncounting container. The detectors comprised a hyper-pure germanium detector and \nthin-film (1 mm) NaI scintillation detector to measure \n137\nCs and \n90\nSr respectively. The \n137\nCs spectra were analysed using the Genie-2000 software package. The activity \nconcentration of \n90\nSr was determined from that of its daughter nuclide, \n90\nY. The \nmethod has previously been calibrated against phantoms containing \n137\nCs and \n90\nSr, \nand \n90\nSr results also validated against traditional radiochemical extraction and \nanalyses methodology (Bondarkov et al., 2002b). The duration of count times varied \nfrom 150 to 1200 seconds depending upon the radioactivity in the animal.   \n 6 \nFollowing live-monitoring, the animals were each returned to the individual \ntrapping point from which they were caught and released. If an animal was recaptured \nmore than 14 d after being fitted with a TLD-collar the TLD was removed, the animal \nreweighed and its whole-body \n90\nSr and \n137\nCs activity concentrations determined again. \nIf it was recaptured less than 14 d after having the collar fitted, the trapping location \nwas recorded and it was released (on some instances additional whole-body Cs \nmeasurements were made). In the last two weeks of the study TLDs were removed if \nan animal was recaptured within 6 days of the TLD having been fitted. A total of 230 \nTLD-collars were fitted to animals of which 85 were recovered; the time recovered \nTLDs had been on the animals ranged from 6 to 36 days. Seven TLDs mounted on \ncollars were transported from the UK to the Chernobyl laboratory and left there for \nthe duration of the study as controls.  \nAt four randomly selected trapping points within each sampling site, TLDs were \nplaced 5 cm above ground level, at ground level and 10 cm deep within the soil. In \neach position, one TLD was prepared in the same manner as those attached to the \ncollars and a second was additionally encapsulated within a 2x2x2 cm cube of \nPerspex. These were left at the study sites for the duration of the experiment when 25 \nof the possible 36 paired TLDs were recovered (the remainder having been lost).  \nThe TLDs recovered from small mammals and the study sites were returned to \nthe supplier for analysis together with the control TLDs. \n2.3 Determination of Pu-isotope activity concentrations in small mammal samples \nPu-isotope activity concentrations have been determined in samples from six animals \nsacrificed at the end of the study and stored frozen prior to analysis. The animals \nwere: two A. flavicollis from the Medium site; two C. glareolus from the Medium site; \nand two Microtus spp. from the High site. The carcass was washed prior to freezing, \nafter defrosting the gastrointestinal tract was removed and disposed of. The liver and a \nbone sample, consisting of a hind-leg and tail, were removed for separate analyses.  \nSamples (bone, liver and remaining carcass) were weighed and transferred to Teflon \ndigestion vessels (120 ml capacity) for a microwave autoclave (UltraClave). Up to 30 \nml nitric acid was added to each the vessel depending on the size of the samples. The \nsystem was closed, loaded with nitrogen to 1.2x10\n7\n Pa, and the mixture was heated to \n240\u00ba C for 30 minutes. The digested samples were then transferred to glass beakers, \nevaporated at 120\u00ba C and taken up in 7M HNO3 prior to radiochemical separation and \nanalyses using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS).  \nHigh purity \n242\nPu (National Physical Laboratory, USA, E3347) was used as a \nyield monitor, with certified \n239\nPu and \n240\nPu concentrations of less than 10\n-5\n Bq per Bq \n242\nPu (these were confirmed by AMS measurement of the tracer). Samples were then \nsubjected to simple radiochemical separation using ion exchange chromatography to \nextract Pu from the sample matrix. Iron(III)nitrate solution was added to the final \neluates, samples taken to dryness, then ashed at 500\u00b0C to give the final material for \nAMS measurements as Fe2O3 (2 mg Fe), with \n242\nPu:Fe atom ratio of 1.2x10\n-8\n.  \nAccelerator mass spectrometry measurements were carried out using the \ncompact AMS facility at PSI Villigen \/ ETH Zurich (Switzerland) full details of the \nanalytical technique can be found in Wacker et al. (2005). The three plutonium \nisotopes (mass 242, 240 and 239) were counted sequentially using repeat cycles for \neach sample. Analytical blanks, in house standards and certified reference material for \nPu and Pu isotope ratios (UKAEA No. UK Pu 5\/92138) were determined for each run. \nPlutonium-239+240\n \nactivities in the samples were calculated from the measured \n 7 \n239\/242 and 240\/242 atom ratios. The detection limit for \n239\nPu was 10 Bq, with \nerrors of 5-20 % for the individual samples, largely attributable to counting errors.   \n \n3 Results \n \n3.1 Experimental data \nSoil activity concentrations of \n90\nSr, \n238,239,240\nPu and detectable gamma-emitting \nradionuclides are summarised in Table 1 (arithmetic means are presented on this and \nsubsequent tables). When minimum activity concentrations were below the detection \nlimit a value of half the detection limit was used to derive the mean estimate. The \nmean percentage dry matter contents of the soils were 97 %, 88 % and 87 % at the \nLow, Medium and High sites respectively. \nThe trapping success varied across the three sites, Table 2 presents the numbers \nand species of animals from which TLDs were recovered at each of the sites. The \npredominant species differed at each site reflecting the different habitats. Trapping \nsuccess at the Low site was reduced because of repeated interference with the traps by \nwild boar (Sus scrofa). \nWhole-body \n137\nCs and \n90\nSr activity concentrations determined in animals from \nwhich TLDs were recovered are summarised by species in Table 2; the mean of \nmeasurements made for individual animals (each animal being live-monitored at least \ntwice) were used to estimate the summary values.  \nConcentrations of \n239+240\nPu in the bone, liver and remaining carcass of the six \nanimals analysed are presented in Table 3; whole-body (without the gastrointestinal \ntract) activity concentrations estimated from these results are also shown. \n Dose rates determined from the TLDs recovered from trapped animals are \npresented in Table 4 together with the gamma-kerma rates determined for each site. \nNo measurable dose rates were recorded on any of the control TLDs. The mean ratio \nof dose rates between the TLDs without and with a 2x2x2 cm Perspex covering \nplaced at various heights above, and depths below, the soil surface at 12 sampling \nlocations was 1.95\u00b10.75 (n=25). There was no trend in this ratio either between study \nareas or with position above\/ below the soil surface. \n3.2 Predictions using the ERICA-Tool \nAn organism geometry to represent each of the three study species was \ngenerated within the ERICA-Tool. The live-weights of the three species, as \ndetermined during the study, were similar. Therefore, the overall average live-weight \nof  30 g was used for all species together with dimensions of 8 cm long, 3.5 cm high \nand 3.5 cm wide (based on measurements made from animals trapped in the area \npreviously by the Ukrainian co-authors of this paper) to create a geometry for which \nthe Tool could estimate DCC values. It was assumed that both C. glareolus and \nMicrotus spp. spend 30 % of their time on the soil surface and 70 % underground \n(The Mammal Society, 2006); A. flavicollis were assumed to spend equal amounts of \ntime above and below ground (The Mammal Society, 2006). The default ERICA CR \nvalues (and associated probability distribution functions) for terrestrial mammals\n1\n \n                                                 \n1\n The ERICA terrestrial mammal CRs are based on available data for all terrestrial mammal with the \nexception of reindeer (see Beresford et al. this issue). \n 8 \nwere assumed to be applicable to each of the species for all radionuclides measured in \nsoil (with the exception of \n40\nK which is not included within the ERICA-Tool).  \n3.2.1 Predicted whole-body activity concentrations \nWhole-body \n137\nCs and \n90\nSr activity concentrations were estimated \nprobabilistically using Tier 3 of the ERICA-Tool and assuming that the soil activity \nconcentrations (as presented in Table 1) were log-normally distributed. The relative \nactivity concentrations of \n239:240\nPu in soil were assumed to be the same as those \ndetermined in the rodent samples by AMS (mean activity ratio \n239:240\nPu = 0.64); the \n238:239\nPu ratio was assumed to be unity based upon relative releases of the two isotopes \nfrom the Chernobyl reactor (from Smith and Beresford 2005) with correction for \ndecay. \nPredicted whole-body activity \n137\nCs and \n90\nSr concentrations are compared to \nlive-monitoring measurements in Table 2; predictions are similar for all three species \nbecause the same CR values were used. For most comparisons the measured values \nare within the range of the predicted 5\nth\n and 95\nth\n percentiles. Exceptions are: (i) all \n137\nCs activity concentrations measured in C. glareolus (n=2) from the High site are in \nexcess of the predicted 95\nth\n percentile value; (ii) the maximum measured \n137\nCs \nactivity concentration for Microtus spp. at the High site is in excess of the predicted \n95\nth\n percentile; (iii) the maximum measured \n90\nSr for A. flavicollis at the Low site is in \nexcess of the 95\nth \npercentile prediction. However, all measured (maximum) values are \nbelow the maximum predicted values (not presented here). Mean predicted \n90\nSr \nwhole-body activity concentrations are all within 50 % of the observed mean. In the \ncase of \n137\nCs mean predicted whole-body concentrations range from an under-\nprediction by nearly an order of magnitude (C. glareolus - High site) to an over-\nprediction of approximately sevenfold (A. flavicollis - Low site). \nPredicted whole-body \n239+240\nPu activity concentrations are compared to the \nmeasured values in Table 3. Although measurements tend to be within (or close to) \nthe predicted ranges they are all at the low end of predictions. The predicted means \n(circa 20 Bq kg\n-1\n (FW) at the Medium site and 33 Bq kg\n-1\n (FW) at the High site) are \nall more than an order of magnitude greater than the highest measured values.   \n3.2.2 Predicted external dose rates and a comparison with the TLD results \nFor comparison with the dose rate estimates reported for the TLDs attached to \nanimals at the study sites, external dose rates have been estimated using: (i) \npredictions made for each individual animal for which a TLD result was available \nusing Tier 2 of the ERICA-Tool; (ii) probabilistic estimations using Tier 3 of the \nERICA-Tool. \nTo derive individual animal specific soil activity concentration inputs for the \ncomparison using Tier 2, spatial interpolations of the data were attempted using block \nkriging (Karssenberg and Burrough, 1996). However, whilst variable, the data \ndemonstrated no significant spatial trend at any of the three sites. Therefore, the \naverage activity concentration was determined for all soil samples falling within a 30 \nm radius of each trapping location (a 30 m radius was considered as representative of \nlikely home ranges of the three species (The Mammal Society, 2007)). If an animal \nhad been caught in more than one trap, a weighted soil activity concentration was \nderived.  \nWhilst \n40\nK is not considered within the ERICA-Tool, DCC values have been \nderived using the same methodology (Ulanovsky pers com; some of these are \n 9 \npresented in Beresford et al. 2007c)\n2\n. Those for the default rat geometry were used to \nestimate external dose rates due to \n40\nK. From the Tier 2 analyses caesium-137 was \nestimated to contribute \u226599 % of the total external dose rate at all three sites; 40K was \nestimated to contribute from 0.02 % at the High site to 0.8 % at the Low site. The \ncontribution to the total dose due to time spent underground was approximately 86 % \nfor both vole species and 72 % for A. flavicollis. Comparison of individual TLD \nmeasurements and Tier 2 predictions is presented after the discussion of the Tier 3 \npredictions.  \nUnfortunately, Tier 3 of the ERICA-Tool does not report a result for total \nexternal dose rate; instead results are presented for each radionuclide. However, as \n137\nCs dominated the estimated external dose using Tier 2, it can be assumed that the \npredicted external dose rate due to \n137\nCs at Tier 3 can be used as a comparison to the \nTLD results (Table 4). The predicted external dose rates are consistently lower than \nthe results of the TLD derived dose rates with the predicted 95\nth\n percentile being less \nthan the minimum dose rate recorded on the TLDs for four of the seven comparisons. \nThe predicted dose rates tend to be in better agreement with the gamma-kerma rates \nmeasured at 5cm above the soil surface (Table 4).   \nHowever, as reported above, the dose rates recorded by TLDs prepared in the \nsame manner as those attached to the study animals and placed at various heights \nabove and below the soil surface were on average 1.95 times higher than the dose \nrates recorded by TLDs situated in the same location but shielded by 2 cm of Perspex. \nIf we assume that this additional dose is the result of exposure to beta radiation \n(excluded by the Perspex) and that it is representative of beta dose rates recorded by \nthe TLDs on the animal collars then we can correct the results from the TLDs attached \nto the collars (i.e. dividing by 1.95) to derive the external gamma dose rate. The \nresultant \u2018corrected\u2019 TLD results are presented in Table 4. Comparison between the \n\u2018corrected\u2019 TLD dose rates and predicted external dose rates are improved, especially \nfor both species from the Low site and C. glareolus at the Medium sites. Mean \npredicted external dose rates ranged from 70 % to 99 % of the \u2018corrected\u2019 TLD \nmeasurement for these animals. For the remaining animals predictions were 31 to 47 \n% of the \u2018corrected\u2019 TLD measurement.  \nWhilst the mean predictions of dose rate are in reasonable agreement with the \n\u2018corrected\u2019 TLD measurements, individual dose rates (estimated using Tier 2) are not \nwell predicted as demonstrated in Figure 2 for the Medium site. \n3.2.3 Total dose rate predictions \u2013 a comparison of Tier 2 and 3  \nAs discussed above, within Tier 2 of the ERICA-Tool the user can select \nuncertainty factors within their assessment to determine the estimated \u2018conservative\u2019 \nabsorbed dose rate and risk quotient. An uncertainty factor of three is suggested for \nuse to give a conservative estimate of absorbed dose rate equivalent to the 95\nth\n \npercentile value (see Brown et al. 2008). To test this assumption, total (internal plus \nexternal) absorbed dose rates have been predicted using Tiers 2 and 3. Table 5 \ncompares the resultant conservative dose rate estimates from Tier 2 with the predicted \n95\nth\n percentile values from Tier 3. For both tiers, calculations were performed using \nsoil activity concentrations as the input, and again, using soil and available whole-\nbody \n137\nCs and \n90\nSr activity concentrations as inputs. Within Tier 3, default CR values \n                                                 \n2\n Note the version of the ERICA-Tool to be released early 2008 should include \n40\nK as a default \nradionuclide. \n 10 \nwith associated probability distributions functions were used (when whole-body \nactivity concentrations were not used\/available) and calculations were performed \nassuming input data were log-normally distributed. In all instances, the 95\nth\n percentile \nvalue predicted using Tier 3 of the Tool was similar to, or lower than, the conservative \nestimate output by Tier 2 (Table 5). Generally, the inclusion of measured whole-body \nactivity concentrations as input data reduced the Tier 2 conservative dose rate and the \nTier 3 95\nth\n percentile prediction; exceptions were observed for some species at the \nHigh site in the results for both tiers. \n \n4 Discussion \n \nThe default ERICA CR values for \n90\nSr, \n137\nCs and \n239\/240\nPu generally predicted \nranges (5\nth\n and 95\nth\n percentiles) in whole-body activity concentrations which \nencompassed the measured data. Predicted \n90\nSr activity concentrations showed the \nbest agreement with the measured data; mean predictions being within a factor of two \nof the observed data means. Whilst predictions of \n137\nCs whole-body activity \nconcentrations for C. glareolus at the High site appear poor (Table 2) there were only \ntwo samples for this species at this site and the species was adequately predicted at the \nother two sites. Observed whole-body activity concentrations of \n239+240\nPu for the few \n(n=6) animals analysed were generally close to the predicted 5\nth\n percentile value \n(Table 3). This is consistent with the finding of an international comparison exercise \nwhich found that the default mammal CR value for Pu used by the ERICA-Tool is one \nto two orders of magnitude higher than that used by other approaches (see Beresford \net al. in press).  \nThere is considerable variation in environmental transfer of radionuclides to \nbiota; the CR databases used to compile the ERICA CR values show three to four \norders of magnitude variation in transfer to mammals for Cs, Sr and Pu. It is possible \nthat the differing agreement between predictions and observations at the three study \nsites was a consequence of site specific factors such as soil characteristics and the \ncontribution of \u2018hot particles\u2019  to the radionuclide deposit (potentially significant and \nvariable within the exclusion zone). In terms of the possible influence of soil type, the \nvariation in comparative transfer of \n137\nCs (lowest at the Low site and highest at the \nHigh site) and \n90\nSr (lowest at the High site and highest at the Low site) at the three \nsites is in agreement with differences in soil to plant transfer observed within the \nexclusion zone (Sobotovich et al. 2003). Since the prediction of all \n90\nSr and \n137\nCs \nmean activity concentrations are within an order of magnitude of the observed data \nmeans, the predicted whole-body activity concentrations for all three radionuclides \ncan be considered acceptable. This study can be considered an independent test of the \nERICA-Tool CR values, the default CR database for mammals contains few \nmeasurements of rodents within the Chernobyl exclusion zone (being limited to one \ndata entry for each of Pu and Sr). \nThe mean predicted external (\n137\nCs) dose rates were within a factor of three of \nmeasured (\u2018corrected\u2019 TLD) values for all site-species combinations. As for \npredictions of whole-body \n137\nCs activity concentrations, agreement was poorest for \nMicrotus spp. and C. glareolus at the High site. Whilst most external dose rate \npredictions were within 50 percent of the measured values all predicted means were \nbelow the mean observed values. However, this may be due, at least in part, to the \n 11 \ninterpretation of what the corrected TLD measurements represent. At the Medium and \nHigh sites the mean whole-body \n137\nCs activity concentration of the animals was \ngreater than the mean fresh weight soil activity concentration (up to 20 times at the \nHigh site). It is, therefore, highly likely that the TLDs recorded \u2018external dose\u2019 \nincluded a contribution from the animal itself.   \nThere was poor agreement between individual TLD measurements and \npredicted external dose rates (see Figure 2).  This may be because the numbers of soil \nsamples taken in the study were insufficient to adequately describe the spatial \nvariation in contamination of soil making individual predictions unreliable (no spatial \ntrends were evident in soil activity concentrations).  \nGiven the uncertainties of conducting a study such as this we consider that the \nagreement observed between the TLD results and the predicted external dose rates \ngives confidence to the predictions of the ERICA-Tool. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis work was partially supported by the EC-EURATOM 6\nth\n Framework \nProgramme (2002-2006) as part of the ERICA (Environmental Risk from Ionising \nContaminants: Assessment and Management) project (contract FI6R-CT-2003-\n508847).
