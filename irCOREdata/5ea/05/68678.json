Stockdale; Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Lancaster Environment Centre,\nLancaster, LA1 4YN, United Kingdom\n21 Introduction\nIron and manganese oxyhydroxides formed within the oxic surface layers of sedi-\nment may play an important role in the regulation of trace element concentrations\nand their vertical distribution in sediments (Douglas and Adeney, 2000). Oxygenic\noxidation of Mn(II) is slow, allowing it to diffuse through the oxic-anoxic interface,\nthus enabling formation of Mn-oxides within the oxic zone (Taillefert et al, 2002)\nand potentially also in the overlying water. A faster oxidation rate limits the Fe(II)\nthat can exist within this zone. These processes were shown distinctly in experiments\nundertaken by Petersen et al (1995). As the authigenic oxides form, they regulate\nthe flux of trace elements into the overlying water (Douglas and Adeney, 2000), via\ncoprecipitation and adsorption mechanisms. Co is released to porewaters within the\nzone of manganese reduction, and recycled between oxic and sub-oxic sediments and\nporewaters (Heggie and Lewis, 1984). Within both marine and freshwater sediments,\nprofiles of Mn(II) have been shown to be closely correlated with those of cobalt\n(e.g. Zhang et al, 2002; Shuttleworth, 1999). Many studies have shown the linkage\nbetween the elements within water columns affected by anoxia (e.g. Balistrieri et al,\n1994; Taillefert et al, 2002; Hamilton-Taylor et al, 2005).\nAs Mn and Fe oxyhydroxides (plus associated trace elements) form within the\noxic zone they can accumulate, via accretion, on the surface of Teflon strips inserted\ninto sediments. This method has been used to study the relationship between these\nauthigenic oxides and trace element cycling within freshwater (Tessier et al, 1996)\nand marine environments (Douglas and Adeney, 2000, estuarine sediment). Where\ndiscrete layers of Mn and Fe oxyhydroxides form they can be analysed independently\n(Tessier et al, 1996).\nThe diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) technique has been used in both\nfreshwater and marine environments to assess the flux of the reduced forms of metals\nto the device. DGT measures directly the flux of metal from the sediment during the\ndeployment time, which reflects the concentration in the porewater, its diffusional\ntransport and the supply from the solid phase to solution. It can be interpreted simply\nas the average porewater concentration at the interface of the device over the deploy-\nment period. Using this technique several studies have revealed close relationships\nbetween DGT measured Mn and Co (e.g. Zhang et al, 2002; Fones et al, 2004).\nHere we present a novel use of DGT to examine the association of cobalt with Fe\nand Mn. We compare Co, Fe and Mn maxima measured by DGT from deployments\nin fresh and aged marine sediments and estimate the ratios of Co associated with the\noxides of Fe and Mn. Ageing and homogenization of one of the sediment samples\nwas undertaken to reduce the concentration of reactive organic matter in the surface\nsediments. This effectively increased the depth range over which the different elec-\ntron acceptors are dominant and resulted in distinct maxima of all three metals.\n32 Materials and methods\n2.1 Sampling and experimental setup\nThe marine sediment used for this experiment was collected, using a Jenkin corer\n(Blomqvist, 1985), from Fleetwood Marina (UK). The site is described more fully\nby Naylor et al (2004). Sediment for the aged\/homogenised and the intact core exp-\neriments were collected in March 2006 and November 2007 respectively. For the\naged sediment experiment, after retrieval the sediment and overlying water were\nthoroughly homogenised and placed in a glass aquarium tank to settle. Once the sed-\niment had settled, overlying water was circulated across it in a smooth flow using a\npump, and trickle devices. Initially this water was bubbled with nitrogen gas for \u223c3\ndays to reduce populations of benthic fauna. Following this treatment, circulation was\nmaintained to provide oxic overlying water and to avoid a thick diffusive boundary\nlayer. The sediment was then left to age for approximately eight months at room\ntemperature (20 \u00b1 2\u25e6C) before the DGT deployments commenced. For the second\npart of the experiment, intact cores were incubated at approximately the in situ temp-\nerature (\u223c 11\u25e6C). Cores, collected in 50 cm tubes, were extruded into shorter tubes\n(\u223c13 cm) so that only sediment was contained in the tubes, thus allowing water\nflow over the sediment surface. Overlying water was circulated through the aquarium\ncontaining the cores to simulate some features of the in situ conditions. The DGT\ndevices were deployed approximately one week after sample collection.\n2.2 DGT preparation and deployment\nDGT planar sediment probes (dgtresearch.com) were prepared using two types of\npolyacrylamide gel. The back layer comprised a gel containing the binding phase\nresin, Chelex-100, and the top layer was a 0.8 mm thick hydrogel. These were pre-\npared according to procedures described elsewhere (e.g. Naylor et al, 2004). The top\ngel layer was covered with a 0.14 mm thick filter membrane (0.45 \u00b5m pore size;\nPall Corporation), giving a total diffusive layer thickness (\u2206g) of 0.94 mm. Prior to\ndeployment all probes were deoxygenated for 24 hours by submerging in ultrapure\nwater (Millipore MQ; 18.2 M\u2126 cm) through which oxygen free nitrogen gas was\ncontinuously bubbled.\n2.3 Experimental and sample processing procedures\nMultiple probes were deployed simultaneously at the beginning of each experiment\n(2 probes per core) and were removed at fixed time intervals to give total deploy-\nment times of 4 to 24 hours. Replicate probes were retrieved at different times to\ncheck that there was no interference to the DGT signal caused by the insertion of the\nprobe, such as channelling or smearing. These effects will tend to have more influ-\nence at shorter deployment times, as the probe will soon (minutes to hours) assume\nthe conditions of the local sediment (Tankere-Muller et al, 2007). Upon retrieval the\n4DGT probes were thoroughly rinsed with MQ water, before refrigerated storage in\nclean plastic bags. Deployed gels were sliced into 5 mm squares using a Teflon coated\nrazor blade mounted on a micromanipulator with vernier scale. The procedure gave\nthree replicates for each depth interval and these are represented by error bars in\nthe figures of the data. For each probe, results were obtained for 17 depth intervals\ncovering 90 mm. Sliced gel pieces were eluted in 0.5 mL of 1M nitric acid (BDH,\nAristar grade) in closed micro-vials for a minimum of 24 hours. Samples were diluted\nby a factor of five before analysis by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry\n(ICP-MS; Thermo Electron X-Series) using Rh as an internal standard. This overall\nprocedure minimises the seawater matrix.\n2.4 Data analysis\nA concentration gradient through the DGT diffusive layers (hydrogel and filter mem-\nbrane) is established by immobilisation of analytes in the binding layer and resupply\nfrom the porewaters at the device interface. The mass of solute accumulated in the\nbinding gel (M) per unit area (A, cm2) divided by the deployment time (t, s), gives\nthe time-averaged solute flux (F) through the diffusive layer (typical units mol cm\u22122\ns\u22121, Eqn. 1).\nF = M\/At (1)\nDGT utilises Fick\u2019s Law of diffusion to determine the time averaged concentrations\nat the probe-sediment interface (CDGT) from the mass of analyte on the binding layer\n(Eqn. 2; where Dd is the diffusion coefficient in the gel).\nF = DdCDGT\/\u2206g (2)\nCombining Eqns. 1 and 2 allows calculation of CDGT (Eqn. 3; Zhang et al, 1998,\nwhere f e is the elution efficiency of the Chelex gel).\nCDGT =\nM\u2206g\nDdAt f e (3)\nIn well stirred solutions CDGT can be considered to be representative of the aqueous\nconcentration. However, in porewaters CDGT represents the average concentration\nat the surface of the device over the deployment period. It only represents the unper-\nturbed porewater concentration when resupply from the solid phase acts as a sufficient\nbuffer. As resupply is unlikely to be sufficient to buffer the porewater, the interfacial\nconcentrations are controlled by varying contributions from the following factors:\ndiffusion, the solid phase pool size and associated desorption kinetics, and active\nremobilisation processes. Theoretical cases of different DGT resupply scenarios have\nbeen investigated in several studies (e.g. Harper et al, 1998; Zhang et al, 2002). Where\na DGT probe detects a redox boundary (i.e. where Fe(II) or Mn(II) show distinct max-\nima) any associated trace element maxima can be assumed to be largely due to release\nof the trace component from the source authigenic oxide as it is utilised as an elec-\ntron acceptor. Trace metal release solely from organic matter (OM) as it degrades,\nis much lower than the concomitant release from authigenic oxides if they are the\n5electron acceptor (e.g., Naylor et al, 2004). Where Fe and Mn peaks do not overlap,\nthe ratios of trace element to solute Mn or Fe may give an estimate of the molar ratio\nassociated with each authigenic oxide.\n3 Results and discussion\n3.1 Effects of the sediment ageing and general observations from the profiles\nIn an intact sediment in an environment without resuspension events, concentration\nprofiles of reactive organic matter and Fe\/Mn (oxyhydr)oxides generally decrease\nwith depth. Collection of the sediment with a Jenkin corer retains intact profiles\nthroughout the depth of the sampled core (typically 13 cm at Fleetwood Marina).\nWhen homogenised and allowed to resettle, the reactive organic matter within the\nsurface sediment will be lower in concentration due to averaging of the profiles. This\nresults in oxidants being dominant over a greater depth range, as their consumption is\ndirectly related to the OM concentration. Conversely, increasing the reactive organic\nmatter at depth may increase sulphide production, as sulphate will be the primary\nelectron acceptor (EA) when the reactive Fe\/Mn (oxyhydr)oxides fall below the con-\ncentration where they are the dominant electron acceptor. This elevated sulphide\nproduction may bring about additional removal of metals via sulphide precipitation.\nAgeing of the sediment further reduces the reactive OM and increases the depth\nrange over which individual oxidants are utilised as the electron acceptor. This was\nobserved visually during the experiment where the light coloured oxic zone increased\nin depth over the ageing period.\nMean DGT concentrations for each depth are shown in Figures 1 (freshly coll-\nected sediment) and 2 (aged sediment), for deployments up to a 24 hour period.\nAdditional probes were deployed for periods longer than 24 hours. However, at de-\nployment times of 36 hours or more competition effects were observed, where Mn is\ndisplaced from the binding phase by Fe (this work, unpublished results).\nAs resupply of solutes to the device interface is not fully sustained, the data\ngenerally show a decrease in the magnitude of CDGT as the deployment time is\nincreased. However, some of the maximum peak values are observed at 8 hrs rather\nthan 4 hrs. This may be due to complexes of the metals with slower diffusion co-\nefficients (Scally et al, 2006) and\/or binding of metals to diffusive gel (Garmo et al,\n2008), increasing the time required for a steady state to be reached. Multiple DGT\ndeployments in soils have shown peak CDGT values at deployment times of 8 to 10\nhrs (Ernstberger et al, 2002), which may be attributable to these effects.\nSome variability in the profiles is to be expected, as there may be heterogeneity\nin the sediment (cores were collected within an area of approximately 100 square\nmeters), or the coring device may introduce some minor inconsistencies between\nthe cores (Blomqvist, 1985). Heterogeneity is likely to affect the intact sediment\ncores to a greater degree than the homogenised sediment. The differences in the\nMn structure in the intact core deployments (Fig. 1) are attributed to this factor.\nAlternative explanations include smearing of sediment across the probe face during\ninsertion or heterogeneity in the resin distribution within the binding phase gel. The\n6Fig. 1 Profiles of DGT concentration, CDGT for Fe, Mn and Co obtained from four DGT deployments\n(4hrs to 24 hrs) in intact sediment cores incubated at 11\u25e6C. Data presented are the mean values of the three\ngel samples for each depth, error bars are one standard deviation from the mean. Positive depths indicate\ndata above the sediment water interface.\n7Fig. 2 Profiles of DGT concentration, CDGT for Fe, Mn and Co obtained from four DGT deployments (4hrs\nto 24 hrs) in homogenised, aged sediment. Data presented are the mean values of the three gel samples for\neach depth, error bars are one standard deviation from the mean. Positive depths indicate data above the\nsediment water interface.\n8Table 1 Relationships between DGT concentrations (CDGT) of Co, Fe and Mn. Correlation coefficients\n(r2) are obtained by comparing surface\/peak data for the four deployments for each of the experiments. The\nsurface-maxima are assumed to be represented by data between \u223c10 mm above, to \u223c20 mm and \u223c40 mm\nbelow the sediment water interface for the aged and fresh sediments respectively. Peak ratios are calculated\nby comparing the peak values (average of the highest three values at the Co maxima) and assuming only\none authigenic oxide is the source. Residual standard deviations (RSD) indicate the variability between the\nfour different deployment times for each experiment.\nCo vs Fe Co vs Mn\nAged Intact Aged Intact\n0.03 0.76 0.85 0.28\nr2 (n=32) (n=48) (n=32) (n=48)\nPeak ratio \u2013 9.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22124 1.06 \u00d7 10\u22123\n(mol mol\u22121) (RSD=8%) (RSD=12%) (RSD=34%)\nsimilarity in the structure of the Fe and Co profiles indicates that these potential\nsources of error are not factors in these deployments.\n3.2 Comparison of the Mn, Fe and Co data\nThe broad maxima in the Fe(II) profiles for the freshly collected, intact core deploy-\nment (Fig. 1) are almost coincident with the Co maxima. There is a small offset\nbetween the Fe and Co data, with the Co maxima being \u223c1 data point (5 mm)\nhigher than that of Fe. This may be due to the difference in the oxidation rates of\nthe reduced species of the two metals. Although, remobilisation of a different trace\nmetal (Cu) close to the sediment surface has been attributed to possible release from\nOM oxidation (Tankere-Muller et al, 2007, and references therein).\nDGT concentration profiles for the aged sediment show much narrower Co max-\nima, coincident with similar maxima of Mn (Fig. 2). We have examined the corr-\nelation between the DGT measured concentrations of Co within the maxima with\nthose of Mn and Fe (Table 1). The values of the correlation coefficient, r2, indicate\nthat there is a dominant relationship between either Fe or Mn, and Co in each of the\nexperiment deployments. For the Fe dominant scenario, r2 is affected by the offset\nbetween the Co and Fe profiles. The lack of any association between Fe and Co in\nthe aged sediment may be due to two contributing factors. 1) The peak Fe concen-\ntrations are up to 10 times lower than in the fresh sediment, which will result in a\ncorresponding lower flux from this source. 2) The solid phase may be affected by the\nageing\/homogenisation process.\nIt is instructive to consider the geochemical processes that may affect the profiles\nof Fe, Mn and Co. These metals differ in their reactivity with sulphide and previous\ndata from this site (Naylor et al, 2004) have shown that Mn is significantly under-\nsaturated with respect to its sulphide phase compared to Fe and Ni (Ni has a similar\ndegree of pyritization to Co; Morse and Luther, 1999). Loss of dissolved Co and Fe\nfrom the aged\/ homogenised system may occur via formation of, or incorporation\ninto, sulphide phases. It is likely that Co is lost via this mechanism to a greater\ndegree than Mn, as its sulphide phase has a much lower solubility product. However,\n9Mn can be removed to some extent in sulphidic systems by coprecipitation with,\nor adsorption to, FeS(s) (Huerta-Diaz et al, 1998). Mn is incorporated into pyrite\nonly where there is a high degree of pyritization. Incorporation of Co into pyrite\nis closely related to the degree of pyrite formation (Morse and Luther, 1999). The\nCo-Fe correlation in the intact cores is unlikely to be due to a direct interaction. The\ncorrelation predominantly stems from Co and Fe removal by formation of sulphides.\nIn the intact core experiment both Fe and Mn are remobilised at the same depth,\nindicating that Mn reduction is occurring. Porewater Mn can increase with depth\nas its concentration is controlled more by adsorption rather than sulphide formation\nin the sulphate reduction zone. This work demonstrates the care that must be taken\nin the interpretation of regression analysis in terms of biogeochemical processes. It\ncould have been tempting to suggest that the good correlation between peak Co and\nFe in the fresh sediments indicates a direct linkage, such as reduction of authigenic\nFe oxides releasing Co. However, there is probably no direct linkage and it simply\nreflects the similarity in their reactions with sulphide.\n3.3 Estimating the association of Co with Fe and Mn (oxyhydr)oxides\nData on the concentrations of metal from remobilisation processes can be used to\nestimate the fraction of trace metal associated with the reduced authigenic oxide.\nThis procedure has been used to obtain ratio data from Co and Mn concentrations\nmeasured in the water column of a seasonally anoxic lake (Hamilton-Taylor et al,\n2005), where a molar Co\/Mn ratio of \u223c 2.8\u00d7 10\u22124 was calculated. Lienemann et al\n(1997) measured these values and also compiled data from several studies of anoxic\nlakes, and reported values in the range 1.1\u00d710\u22124 to 2.6\u00d710\u22123. The ratios we have\nmeasured for Co\/Mn from both of our experiments are within the range of the above\nvalues (Table 1). Peak ratios we have calculated from previous DGT deployments\nin marine sediments are \u223c5\u20138 times higher than the (aged) value obtained in this\nwork (Zhang et al, 2002; Fones et al, 2004). This may be due to differences in the\nmolar fractions of Co associated with authigenic oxides in the different environments,\nor loss of dissolved Co from the aged\/homogenised system through formation of,\nor incorporation into, sulphide phases. For the intact sediment the Co\/Mn value is\nclose to the largest value cited above. Assuming there is some contribution from the\nauthigenic Fe, the actual Co\/Mn ratio may be slightly smaller that those reported\n(see below). The relatively low residual standard deviations (RSD) between the peak\nratios across the 4 deployment times (Table 1) indicate that the replicate probes give\nconsistent molar ratio data.\nPassive sampling type techniques, such as Teflon strips and the DGT probes\nused in this work, calculate values from bulk processes. Estimates of trace metal\nassociation using such techniques are thus based on averaged measurements. Also,\ndetermination of the original stoichiometry of the mineral assemblage from measure-\nments of dissolved concentrations may differ from those obtained if the solid phase\nwere analysed. Additionally, measured dissolved concentrations may be lowered com-\npared to the solid phase by the occurrence of side reactions (e.g. reaction with sulphide).\nParticles of biogenic origin isolated from the oxic waters column may have different\n10\nformation mechanisms and kinetics than oxides formed within the oxic zone of surface\nsediments. Differences in the ratios of Co\/Mn between water column measurements\nand isolated biogenic micro-particulates were reported by Lienemann et al (1997) for\na freshwater system. They reported Co\/Mn ratios on micro-particulates one order\nof magnitude higher than ratios in the anoxic water column (\u223c2% compared to\n\u223c0.3%). This study also reported significant concentrations of Fe associated with\nMn oxides. This highlights the complexity of estimating associations of trace metals\nwith individual oxide minerals.\nIt has been show that in early stages of formation manganese oxides contain\nmany vacancies (Saratovsky et al, 2006; Petkov et al, 2009). These vacancies are\nthe primary site for the sorption of trace metals. Furthermore, Co adsorbed to the\noxide can be oxidised to Co3+ and subsequently incorporated into the oxide structure\n(Manceau et al, 1997). The nature of the oxides suggests that manganese oxides may\nhave a greater fraction of associated Co than iron oxyhydroxides. For a sediment from\na freshwater circumneutral lake (McFarlane, Canada) the ratio of trace metals (TM)\nassociated independently with Mn-oxides and Fe oxyhydroxides (TM\/Mn : TM\/Fe)\nwere 9.0, 2.0, 2.1, 3.8 and 0.56, for Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb respectively (Tessier et al,\n1996). Cobalt data were not obtained in their study. However, trapping of Co by man-\nganese oxides is more efficient than the trapping of Ni (Shaw et al, 1990), indicating\nthat Co ratios should be at the upper end of the range of values in the Tessier et al\n(1996) data. Assuming Co in the intact cores is supplied from both authigenic oxides,\nand that enrichment within Mn oxide is 9 times that of Fe (oxyhydr)oxide (a conser-\nvative estimate given the observations cited above), the individual molar ratios can be\nestimated from the peak data. Using this method we calculated ratios of 5.2\u00d7 10\u22125\nfor Co\/Fe and 4.6\u00d7 10\u22124 for Co\/Mn. The Co\/Mn data are within the range detailed\nabove. Fewer data exist for the ratios of Co\/Fe, but our derived value is approx-\nimately half the value that can be calculated from the estuarine sediment data of\nDouglas and Adeney (2000), of \u223c 1.2\u00d710\u22124.\n4 Conclusions\nWe have presented a new application of the DGT technique, namely estimation of the\nmolar ratios of trace metal associated with authigenic Fe and Mn (oxyhydr)oxides.\nIt exploits the fact that localized maxima in trace metals in porewaters are due to\ndissolution of the host solid phase. In the case presented, the Mn maxima are not\nvisible in DGT measured concentration profiles of freshly collected sediment cores,\npresumably due to overlap of redox zones and rapid recycling of Mn(II)\/Mn-oxide\nin the surface layer of the sediment. After ageing of the sediment a distinct Mn peak\nwas observed. Calculated ratios for Co\/Mn from both experiments were within the\nrange of values cited in the literature. The value from the aged experiment was at the\nlower end of the range and this was attributed to loss of Co in the experimental system\ndue to sulphide formation during the ageing period. Good correlations obtained from\nregression analysis were probably due to the varied processes of sulphide formation\nof the three metals rather than the more obvious direct linkage. The study provides\nadditional evidence of the association of Co with oxides in sediment and demonstrates\n11\nthat Co is likely to be associated more with Mn rather than Fe oxides. To date\nno specific extraction schemes can specifically target a single metal oxide without\nextracting others. The procedure presented here allows single oxides to be targeted\nfor extraction to a greater extent than previously reported techniques.\nFuture developments could include extending the range of metals analysed using\nthis technique. The method could also be developed to assess the effect biogeo-\nchemical cycling at the sediment surface has on influencing the fate and cycling of\nsoluble metal pollutants. This could be done by spiking the systems with dissolved\nmetal and analysing using DGT, over several weeks or months.\nAcknowledgements A.
