A recent systematic review of such \ntraining Bailey et al (in press) has highlighted a number of barriers to the \nimplementation in practice of specialist knowledge and skills gained on such \nprogrammes.  One way to address this issue is through supervision in the workplace \nto support the transfer of learning Evans (1999), Brown and Bourne (1996). This is \nparticularly important on post-qualifying programmes where experienced \npractitioners report, organisational constraints to the implementation of new skills \nBarnes et al (2000), Carpenter et al (2000).  \n \nInvestigations into the role of supervision as a potential aid to interprofessional \nlearning on evaluated, post qualifying mental health training programmes are absent \nfrom the literature Bailey et al (ibid). For this reason the current study sought to \nexplore the experience of providing interprofessional supervision to workers from \ndifferent disciplinary backgrounds undertaking a masters level programme in \nCommunity Mental Health.  \n \nThe Community Mental Health (CMH) Programme \n \nParticipants on the MA in Community Mental Health are recruited from a range of \nprofessional backgrounds in health and social care including people who are currently \nusing mental health services provided they have a paid or voluntary role. Places are \nallocated to participants who have a supervisor in the work place to assist them \ntransfer their learning from the one-day per week taught sessions to their practice. \nSupervisors are expected to have prior experience and to have completed recognised \npost registration training themselves. They can supervise one or more supervisees \nfrom the same or different professional backgrounds. Supervision sessions can be \noffered as one-to-one or on a group basis.  \n \nTo assist them in their role an eight-day course is provided for supervisors run each \nyear, in parallel with the course for the practitioners.  To reflect the fact that \nsupervisors may be supporting workers from different disciplines the sessions are \ndelivered using a range of methods designed to promote interprofessional learning \nBarr et al (1999).  \n \nObjectives of the Study \n \nThe supervisors\u2019 programme was established over a short time period with no \nopportunity to pilot the sessions. Therefore there was a need to explore how their \nexperience of supervising participants on this particular course compared with other \nprogrammes. This dictated the need for a formative approach to an internal \nevaluation.  \n \n \n 4\nThe objectives of the study were to: \n \n\u2022 Explore supervisors\u2019 perceived training needs prior to them attending the \ncourse and obtain their reactions to the training they received to clarify their \nrole on the MA in Community Mental Health  \n \n\u2022 Elicit feedback from supervisors and their supervisees about the type, \nfrequency and focus of supervision sessions. Of particular interest was how \nthe interprofessional focus of the CMH programme might influence the \ndelivery of one-to-one or group supervision as a means of reinforcing change \nin interprofessional working in the work setting.  \n \n\u2022 Investigate the extent to which supervisors were supervising workers from \ndifferent disciplinary backgrounds as an indicator of the degree to which \ninterprofessional support was being provided.  \n \nMETHODS \n \nA combination of qualitative and quantitative methods were utilised. A review of the \nacademic literature on supervision was undertaken by searching the following \nelectronic databases: Assia, BIDS, British Educational index, Cinahl, EMBAS, Eric, \nInternational Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Medline, PsychLIT and Sociofile. \nThe search strategy employed is set out in Table 1 below. \n \nTable 1: Search Strategy   \n \n#1 INTERPROFESSIONAL* or INTERDISCIPLINARY* or \nMULIDISCIPLINARY* or MULTIPROFESSIONAL* \n#2 SUPERVISION \n#3 INTERPROFESSIONAL* EDUCATION \n#4 INTERPROFESSIONAL* TRAINING \n#5 CLINICAL SUPERVISION  \n#6 INTERPROFESSIONAL* SUPERVISION and EDUCATION \n#7 INTERPROFESSIONAL* SUPERVISION and TRAINING \n \n \n \nA pre-course questionnaire was circulated to all supervisors asking for information \nabout relevant experience and any previous supervisory training. Questions allowed \nsupervisors to comment on their confidence and skill in delivering elements of the \nsupervisory role including: giving feedback, formulating a learning contract, being \nable to run individual and group supervision sessions, giving advice re: academic \nassignments (including portfolios of evidence) and assessing competent practice in the \nwork place. An open question gave supervisors the opportunity to say what they \nwanted to gain from the training on offer.  \n \nEvaluation forms were completed by supervisees and their supervisees at the end of \neach year of the MA programme. Data about the frequency, duration and type of \nsupervision and whether this was provided on an individual or group basis were \ncollected. Respondents were also asked about the foci of supervision sessions and \nhow important they rated these. This allowed for a comparison between the views of \n 5\nthe course participants and their supervisors. Supervisors were asked specifically to \nrate on a five-point scale (1= not useful 5= most useful) the topic areas covered during \ntheir training.  \n \nFINDINGS  \n \nClarifying the Supervisory Role \n \nThe literature review yielded piecemeal evidence of the existence of a supervisory \nrole to support interprofessional learning not least because traditionally supervision is \nunidisciplinary. Particularly in the health field supervision is commonly referred to as \n\u201cclinical\u201d Bishop (1998), Bond and Holland (1998), Butterworth et al (1998) \nstemming from its origins within the disciplines of counselling, psychotherapy and \nmore recently nursing. However the literature revealed a lack of consensus about the \nrelevance of \u2018clinical supervision\u2019 in mental health nursing Simms (1993) and \nKipping (1998). This suggests that the supervisors\u2019 role on an interprofessional \nprogramme accessed by mental health nurses amongst other disciplines may also be \nsignificantly different to supervising traditional psychotherapy or counselling \nencounters.  \n \nThe CMH programme focuses on the rights and recovery of people with lived \nexperience of mental health problems. This involves practitioners in a \u201cbeing with\u201d \nrather than \u201cdoing to\u201d approach Hinselwood (1998) and requires supervisors to think \nabout their role differently to providing clinical supervision not least because of its \nperceived relationship with the medical model and the emphasis on technical aspects \nof care delivery Bond and Holland (1998). As an alternative \u201cwork based \nsupervision\u201d suggests that which is tailored to a range of mental health settings and \ncan be provided by any discipline including people with lived experience of using \nservices.  \n \nAn aim of the CMH programme was that learners would change their practice in line \nwith contemporary models of mental health care which involves implementing new \nskills in interprofessional working and interventions such as Cognitive Behaviour \nTherapy (CBT) and family work Social Services Inspectorate (1994) and the \nSainsbury Centre (1997). It was expected that \u2018work-based\u2019 supervisors would enable \nworkers to be change agents, both in their learning and practice. This is supported by \nGeorgenson (1982) who identifies the need for supervision to maximise opportunities \nfrom learning gained on \u201coff the job\u201d courses for bringing about changes in \neffectiveness at work. In some forward thinking organisations it was hoped that \nsupervisors might be able to link change at the practitioner level to more significant \nchanges within the organisation, referred to as the \u201clink pin\u201d function of supervision \nPlunkett (1996: 16). One way that CMH supervisors could achieve this would be to \nbring workers together from this and other skills based programmes in family work \nand CBT taking place throughout the region, to discuss cases and practice issues as a \nstep towards developing a network of skilled practitioners. \n \nThe Department of Health\u2019s 1993 definition of supervision came closer to the vision \nof the \u2018work-based\u2019 supervisory role held by the programme providers i.e. \u201ca formal \nprocess of professional support and learning which enables practitioners to develop \nknowledge and competence, assume responsibility for their own practice and enhance \nconsumer protection and the safety of care in complex situations\u201d. Also that \nsupervision would be \u201ccentral to the process of learning and to the expansion of the \n 6\nscope of practice and should be seen as the means of encouraging self-assessment and \nanalysis and reflective skills.\u201d (p:15) \n \nThirty-one supervisors returned the pre-course questionnaire revealing that all had \nsupervised learners previously with 94% reporting five or more years of experience. \nThis tended to have been on professional programmes where supervisees were \nqualifying to become nurses or social workers and where supervisors were involved in \na pass or fail assessment of their learners\u2019 competence to practice. This previous \nexperience, whilst relevant, differed from the Department of Health\u2019s definition of \nwork-based supervision identified above.  \n \nThe perceived learning needs and areas of competence of the 31 supervisors reflected \nthat they were aware to some extent of the differing emphasis in their role on this \nprogramme compared with previously. Just over half of the group said they would \nlike to know more about the theory underpinning adult learning and almost half \nreported a need for further guidance about how to respond to different learning styles \nin supervision.  Just under half also said they required more information to understand \nthe theory of the skills based approaches, whilst 55% said they would need further \nguidance to be able to supervise workers to use these techniques in practice.   \n \nReflecting the level of previous experience of the respondents, all bar one (who did \nnot answer the question) said they were able to give structured and constructive \nfeedback. Similarly more than three quarters felt they could assess competence in the \nworkplace and give advice to learners about how to promote antidiscriminatory \npractice. Whilst 71% of supervisors expressed their competence in assisting learners \ncompile a portfolio of evidence of practice this fell to 55% who felt they could give \nadvice about academic assignments suggesting that the learners previously supervised \nmay not have been following programmes at a masters level. (See Table 1 below) \n \nTable 1: Supervisors Reported Learning Needs and Areas of Competence \nElements of the Supervisory Role  Self-Reported to \nbe Competent \nFurther Guidance \nand information \nneeded \nGiving structured and constructive  \nfeedback \n30  \nRunning individual and group supervision \nsessions \n28  \nGiving advice and practical guidance on how \nto promote antidiscriminatory practice  \n26 5 \nAssessing competent practice in the work \nplace \n24 5 \nFormulating a learning contract with \nsupervisee \n23 8 \nGiving advise to supervisee re: putting \ntogether a portfolio of evidence \n22 9 \nGiving advice re: academic assignments 17 14 \nResponding to different learning styles in \nsupervision  \n16 15 \nUnderstanding the theory of CBT and family  \nInterventions \n15 15 \nUnderstanding the theory re: adult learning 13 18 \n 7\nBeing able to supervise others to use CBT \nand family interventions \n13 17 \nRunning group supervision sessions 2 6 \n \nA further insight into how supervisors interpreted their role was obtained from their \nresponses about what they wanted to gain from the supervisors training course. Eight \nsaw the programme as contributing to their own personal and professional \ndevelopment by providing opportunities for reflection and exploration of new ideas \nand perspectives. Related to this 8 also said that they hoped the programme would \nrefresh and update the knowledge and skills they had acquired previously.  \n \nFive supervisors wanted practical suggestions about how to deliver the supervisory \nrole more effectively, particularly with regard to structuring supervision sessions and \nusing appraisal and assessment skills. Three respondents mentioned specifically the \nneed to explore new models for supervision including learning styles.  \n \nAlmost a third of the supervisors (n=10) wanted to know more about the CMH \nprogramme on which their learners had embarked and their role within it. Linked with \nthis 8 identified the need to be able to support their learners\u2019 development and 3 \nexpressed a wish to assist learners make a positive change in the workplace. Four \nsupervisors wanted an opportunity to network with others undertaking the role and \nshare their experience.   \n \nThese findings suggest a degree of congruence between the programme providers \nviews of the work-based supervisory role as emerging from the literature and the \nexpectations held by the supervisors themselves. \n \nFeedback About the Experience of Supervision \n \nIndividual or Group Supervision  \n \nTwenty-eight supervisors reported feeling competent to deliver both individual and \ngroup supervision on the pre-course questionnaires. Hawkins and Shohet (1999) point \nout the benefits of group supervision including:  peer support, opportunities to \npractice skills learned on the programme and economical use of supervisors\u2019 time all \nof which were deemed relevant to the type of supervision the CMH programme was \ntrying to promote.   \n \nGroup as opposed to individual supervision could further reinforce learning transfer \nfor CMH participants by reflecting the therapeutic context in which some learners \nwere working, for example running groups to help users with mental health problems \ncope with hearing voices or manage their medication.  In some Trusts several \nmembers from the same team were learners on the programme. It was thus important \nto allow supervisors the opportunity to develop an approach that supported the team\u2019s \ninter-related work life (Scaife 2001). \n \nOf the 24 supervisors who completed questionnaires either at the end of years 1 or 2 \nof the learners\u2019 programme all reported providing individual supervision compared \nwith only 9 who said they provided it to a group. Forty-six participants on the CMH \nprogramme responded about their experience using a similar questionnaire, 27 from \nyear one and 19 from year 2. Of the first year learners 89% reported that they received \nindividual supervision and 56% said they received it as a group. By the second year of \n 8\nthe course these numbers appeared to have dropped with 58% of learners saying they \nreceived individual and 32% group supervision.  \n \nBased on these reports it might be hypothesised that year one learners being new to \nthe programme are deemed to need more support and guidance in the workplace \nwhich declines as the course progresses. Despite discussions with supervisors about \nthe benefits of group supervision as means of reinforcing learning transfer from the \ncourse to the workplace 25 participants from both years of the programme, \nrepresenting all mental health disciplines said they received no group supervision. \nAlso of concern was that six learners reported receiving no supervision although 5 \nsaid they were linked into supervision groups specifically set up within their \norganisations to support the development of behavioural family therapy skills. Of \nthese 6 participants 4 were Occupational Therapists (OTs), 1 a psychiatrist and 1 a \npsychologist. Three commented that work based supervision in their organisations \nshould have been given a higher priority but that there was a lack of suitably \nexperienced or interested colleagues willing to take on the role.  \n \nFrequency and Duration of Supervision Sessions \n \nAlthough the majority of studies in the academic literature omitted to evaluate these \nvariables Newell and Gournay (1994), White (1994) and Brooker et al (1996) the post \ncourse evaluation forms for supervisors and supervises asked for this information. \nThis reflected the literature on supervision that its availability should be tailored to \nlearners\u2019 needs whilst being provided on a regular and planned basis, if it is to be \neffective Bond and Holland (1998).  \n \nFigures 1 and 2 relate to CMH participants\u2019 reports of the frequency of supervision \nshowing that regular individual supervision is reported by all disciplines except \npsychology and psychiatry. As expected the duration of these sessions varied from \none hour minimum to two hours maximum. Of the 8 supervisors who reported \noffering group supervision these sessions tended to be slightly longer in duration \nsuggesting supervisors are attempting to be flexible in their approach whilst providing \nsufficient time for their learners.  \n \n01\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nsocial work Nursing OT Psychology Psychiatry Other\nFigure 1: Frequency of One to One Supervision Reported by Participants According \nto Discipline\n3 weekly\nmonthly\nbi monthly\nwhen required\nnot at all\n \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nsocial work Nursing OT Psychology Psychiatry Other\nFigure 2: Frequency of Group Supervision Reported by Participants According to \nDiscipline\nweekly\n3 weekly\nmonthly\nbi monthly\nwhen required\nnot at all\nThe duration of supervision sessions (see Table 2 below) as reported by CMH \nparticipants reinforce supervisors\u2019 reports that individual supervision sessions are \nmore likely to last for either for about an hour whilst longer 2-hour sessions tend to be \nreserved for group supervision. They also support the findings above that more year 1 \nlearners report receiving supervision than their year 2 counterparts.   \n \nTable 2: Duration of Individual and Group Supervision Sessions as Reported by \nParticipants  \n \n Year One Year Two \nDuration Individual Group Individual Group \nHourly 9 5 7 2 \n1.5 Hours 8 6 3 3 \n2 hours  4 1 1 \n 9\n \nInterprofessional Work-based Supervision \n \nThe post course evaluation form provided information about interprofessional \nsupervision as a tool for helping learning transfer. That several supervisors saw this as \na positive opportunity is reflected in Figure 3 which shows that supervisors from the \ndisciplines of nursing, social work and psychology offered supervision to learners \nfrom 3 different disciplinary backgrounds. This contrasts with the UKCC\u2019s position \nstatement in 1986 that only in exceptional circumstances would a nurse be supervised \nby someone other than a nurse or health visitor and reflects the development of \nmultidisciplinary mental health services over the last decade. However further \ninvestigation is needed into how the learners perceived supervision received from a \ncolleague of another discipline as in Jones and Bennett\u2019s (1999) study 65% of the \nnurses interviewed questioned its value.  \n \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\nnursing social work psychology ot psychiatry\nSupervisors Discipline\nFigure 3: Relationship Between Supervisor's Discipline and Discipline of \nSupervisees\nNursing\nSocial Work\nOT\nAdvocacy\nInterprofessional supervision also varied between disciplines. Figure 3 also shows that \nOT\u2019s acting as supervisors report supervising only OT colleagues whilst psychiatrists \nare supervising nurses. The latter generated some discussion in the supervisors\u2019 \nsessions where it was felt such a supervisory relationship could lead to difficulties \nemerging depending on the psychiatrists\u2019 approach to multidisciplinary working. As \npsychiatrists were perceived to hold the power within mental health teams one \nsupervisor commented that it \u201cmight be difficult for the nurse being supervised to \nmove from a handmaiden role to a thinking role\u201d. Another felt that \u201cif the \npsychiatrist demonstrates poor practice in respect of interdisciplinary working this \ncould lead to angry discussion\u201d. Both types of issues were felt to impact negatively \non nurses\u2019 learning opportunities.  \n \nHowever another supervisor said that if colleagues could get beyond the professional \nstereotypes \u201cpeoples real thoughts and ideas come out as individual people who do \nreflect on what they do\u201d. This was felt to be a positive step towards transferring \ninterdisciplinary learning into practice. \n \n 10\n 11\nNot all supervisors directly managed their learners especially if providing \ninterprofessional supervision. Some saw this as a positive opportunity for taking a \ndevelopmental approach to improving practice rather then being governed by \nmanagement decisions about caseload size. Others articulated that a lack of line \nmanagement responsibility often meant that plans made in supervision to pursue \nopportunities for learning transfer were undermined by unrealistic targets and no \nallowance for the day each week spent on the CMH programme.  \n \nFor some learners being supervised by their manager was a positive experience \nespecially where managers where able to exploit the \u201clink pin\u201d function of \nsupervision referred to earlier Plunkett (ibid). In these instances managers were able \nto promote change in the teams and individual practitioner\u2019s workloads to provide real \nopportunities for changing their practice in line with the CMH programme. Particular \nfeatures that were felt to contribute to such a positive supervisory experience were \nreported to be \u201ctrust\u201d the \u201cmanagers personality\u201d and the establishment of a \n\u201ctherapeutic relationship\u201d between the manager and the learner. This was likened to \nthe relationship learners were being encouraged to develop with mental health service \nusers through the CMH programme. \n \nThe Supervisors Sessions \n \nAt the end of the first year of the supervisors\u2019 programme 24 completed evaluation \nforms about the sessions they had attended. In accordance with individual \ndevelopment needs supervisors differed in their opinions about which sessions were \nmost useful as shown in Table 3. \n \nTable 3: What supervisors found most useful about the training Programme \noffered \n \nFocus of Session Rated Most Useful (4 or 5) by \nSupervisors \nGenerating Evidence for Portfolios 10 \nGiving Feedback 9 \nAdult Learning Styles 8 \nLearning Contracts 7 \nAssessment methods and assignments 6 \nWorking with Barriers to Change 6 \nUnderstanding Competence 5 \nDeveloping the Supervision Curriculum  5 \nUnderstanding Organisational Change 5 \n \n \nDespite 71% of supervisors reporting pre-course, their competence in assisting \nlearners compile a portfolio of evidence 10 responding afterwards said they had found \nsessions on this topic useful. Similarly 9 had valued the guidance on giving feedback, \nanother area where all bar one of the 31 pre course respondents had expressed their \nconfidence to do this.  These findings could be accounted for by different supervisors \ncompleting the questionnaires pre and post course. Another explanation might be that \ndespite their initial perceptions of their abilities the inputs on these areas had provided \nsupervisors with additional learning.  \n \nSupervisors and supervisees were asked to prioritise the focus of the supervisory \nsessions. Figure 4 shows consensus that sessions, which focused on giving support \nwith assignments were accorded highest priority, followed by the transfer of learning \ninto practice. Bringing about change was accorded a high\/medium priority by over \none third of learners. Time management was also reported as a priority by over a \nquarter of participants although supervisors were less in agreement about the \nimportance of these two areas.  \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nAss Trans\nLear\nVal & UI Learn Out Change CBT Time Man Cs Load\nMan\nFam\nWork\nFigure 4: Focus of Supervision Sessions as Rated by Supervisors and Supervisees\nReported high\/med priority by supervisors\nRated high\/med priority by supervisees\nKey to Figure 4 \n \nAss Assignments \nTrans Lear Transfer Learning into Practice \nVal & UI Values and User Involvement \nLearn Out Learning Outcomes of the Modules \nChange Bringing about change \nCBT CBT Interventions \nTime Man Time Management \nCs Load Man Case Load Management \nFam Work Family Work \n \nLearners were asked whether aspects of the supervisory role had been demonstrated in \naccordance with suggestions from the literature on good practice. Feedback revealed \nsimilar experiences across years 1 and 2 of the programme with work-based \nsupervisors providing a networking role (see Table 5 below). However findings \nsuggested that year 1 learners were much more likely than those in year 2 to have a \nlearning contract, setting out expectations regarding the supervisory relationship \nDriscoll (1999). This could be due to year 1 learners being perceived as needing a \nmore structured approach. Another explanation might be that supervisors having \nwelcomed the input on learning contracts during their sessions started to implement \nthem more systematically as they began supervising new learners. \n \n \n \n \n 12\n 13\nTable 5: Learners Reports of Whether Specific Elements of the Work-based \nsupervisory role had been demonstrated in practice  \n Year One Year Two \nA jointly agreed learning contract with your \nsupervisor \n17 5 \nLinked into supervision groups in your Trust for \nBehavioural Family Therapy \n14 14 \nOpportunities to share learning with peers on the \ncourse or other workers who are doing Cognitive \nBehavioural interventions  \n11 11 \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nThe purpose of this study was to begin to explore the contribution work-based \nsupervision could make to support learners on a master\u2019s level interprofessional \ntraining programme. \n \nThe findings although limited by small numbers and a lack of generalisability suggest \nthat despite significant experience of supervising learners previously, supervisors \nvalued a planned programme that combined input about the specific course on which \ntheir learners were embarked, including the methods of assessment and the \nsupervisory role within it, with an opportunity for networking and sharing experience.  \n \nPrior to attending the course supervisors reported that they had a level of awareness \nthat their role on this interprofessional programme was likely to differ from previous \nsupervisory encounters. This was supported by the literature review that identified the \nlack of \u2018fit\u2019 between traditional unidisciplinary supervision provided on \npsychotherapy or counselling programmes and the needs of professionals such as \nmental health nurses.  \n \nWhere programmes expose participants to interprofessional learning methods work \nbased supervision has the potential to reinforce learning transfer to practice. This is \nmore likely to occur where supervisors adopt the \u2018link pin\u2019 function of supervision \nPlunkett (ibid) to enable learners access other interprofessional learning opportunities \navailable in the organisations. Other important opportunities arise where supervisors \nhave management responsibilities that allow them to create a climate for change \nGeorgenson (ibid). Also important is where managers are able to establish a trusting, \ntherapeutic relationship with their supervisee in addition to their mainstream \nmanagement role. Interprofessional learning may be further supported where \nsupervisors support supervisees from more than one discipline although this seems to \nbe more available to some occupational groups than others and can be hampered by \npower relationships and interprofessional stereotypes. However further information \nneeds to be elicited from learners on interprofessional programmes about value of \nbeing supervised by member of a different discipline in respect of achieving learning \noutcomes.  \n \nThe importance of work-based supervision in assisting supervisees with their \nacademic work was identified by both learners and their supervisors. This apparent \ncontribution of work based supervision to support academic performance over and \nabove bringing about change in practice seems disconcerting, although perhaps not \nsurprising as learners on the MA programme were keen to do well. Nevertheless this \n 14\ncontribution can be seen to relate to Department of Health\u2019s definition of supervision \nthat emerged as particularly relevant from the literature review in that assignments \nprovide a means of encouraging self-assessment, analysis and reflective skills and \nsupervision on this programme was seen as central to their achievement. This \nchallenges course providers to think carefully about how to retain a balance between \nmeeting the academic standards of the higher education institution whilst continually \nseeking assessment methods that require workers to be change agents in their practice. \n \nQuestionnaires revealed that some disciplines are more likely than others to receive \nregular supervision with individual rather than group supervision being more readily \navailable. This has the potential to limit opportunities for interprofessional learning at \nthe expense of meeting individuals\u2019 development needs. Although in the minority on \nthis programme, where learners reported receiving no supervision, this was viewed as \na disappointment and perhaps a reflection of the organisations\u2019 lack of commitment. \nWhilst work-based supervision seems to be deemed important for new learners further \nwork is needed to evaluate the impact of the supervision tailoring off particularly as \non many post qualifying programmes the academic requirements present more of a \nchallenge as the course progresses. \n \nAs a result of this preliminary exploration of the supervisory role a more in-depth \nevaluation of the supervisors development programme is underway focusing upon the \nwork based supervisory role in assisting learners\u2019 skill development in \ninterprofessional and evidence based practice. The curriculum of the supervisors \nprogramme is being evaluated further in an attempt to ensure that work based \nsupervisors are being better equipped to support learners on the CMH programme \nbring about real improvements in mental health practice.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15\nReferences \n \nBAILEY, D., CARPENTER, J., DICKINSON C. and ROGERS H.
