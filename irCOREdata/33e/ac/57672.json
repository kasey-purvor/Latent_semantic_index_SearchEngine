Introduction 55 \nApproximately 880 million people still lack access to safe drinking water, the lowest coverage found in 56 \nsub-Saharan Africa. Waterborne diseases, such as diarrhoea, cause 1.5 million deaths a year, 57 \nprominently to children in developing countries (JMP, 2008). It is estimated that child mortality and 58 \ncould be significantly reduced and general health improved by providing access to safe potable water 59 \nand improving sanitation and hygiene (WHO, 2004). This is the compelling motivation for 60 \ngovernments and aid organisations to avoid acute problems of waterborne diseases by constructing 61 \nboreholes and wells to improve coverage of safe water sources.  However, these new sources, if not 62 \nadequately monitored, may instead be a source of chronic health problems due to high concentrations 63 \nof inorganic contaminants such as arsenic (As), fluoride (F-) and  nitrate (NO3-) (Bissen and Frimmel, 64 \n2003a; Reimann and Banks, 2004)  65 \n 66 \nGhana, in West Africa, celebrated 50 years of independence from colonial rule in 2008, and is often 67 \nhailed as an African economic and political success (Naylor, 2003). Yet, Ghana is still struggling to 68 \nprovide safe drinking water and sanitation to all its inhabitancy, especially in rural areas (UNICEF, 69 \n2007). Although Ghana is doing better than its immediate neighbours (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Togo), 70 \nnearly 12% of Ghanaian children die before they reach the age of five compared to e.g. 6% of children 71 \nin South Africa and 0.6% of children in the UK (UNICEF, 2007). Access to safe water is an important 72 \nfactor to reduce the number of deaths. According to JMP (2008), 29% of the rural population rely on 73 \nunimproved water sources. The majority of the improved sources in rural Ghana are boreholes and 74 \nprotected wells.  75 \n 76 \nGhana has 10 administrative regions: Western Region, Eastern Region, Central Region, Greater Accra, 77 \nVolta Region, Ashanti Region, Brong-Ahafo, Northern Region, Upper West and Upper East. The 78 \nFinal author submission: Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2378\u20132386 \n 4\npopulation according to the last census (2000) was 18.9 million and with a growth rate of bout 2.6% is 79 \nestimated at 23 million people (UNICEF, 2007). Although most of the population growth is taking part 80 \nin cities, the majority of Ghana\u2019s population still live in rural areas. Ghana\u2019s Water Policy expresses the 81 \nneed to both ensure access to enough safe water to meet basic human needs and at the same time ensure 82 \nthe environmental and financial sustainability of the water source (Government of Ghana, 2007). In an 83 \nattempt to make the water delivery in the country more effective, Ghana\u2019s water supply has, amidst 84 \nmuch controversy, been made parastatal (Agyeman, 2007). The Ministry of Water Resources, Works 85 \nand Housing remains the government institution responsible for water resource management and 86 \ndrinking water supply, while the Ghana Water Company Ltd (GWCL) is in charge of urban water 87 \nprovision. The Community Waste and Sanitation Agency (CWSA) is in charge of facilitating safe 88 \nwater provision and providing technical assistance to the District Assemblies, who are responsible for 89 \nplanning and operation of the water supply to rural communities on a local level (Agyeman, 2007). The 90 \nCWSA standard is one well or borehole per 300 people. The community are responsible for operation 91 \nand maintenance. Regional progress reports (Government of Ghana, 2007), report 40-80% coverage 92 \ndepending on the region; however some organisations and individuals do not operate through the 93 \nCWSA and thus the total number of improved sources is not accurately known (Nyarko et al., 2009). 94 \nAs the boreholes are constructed, the chemical water quality should be analysed for fluoride (F-), 95 \nmanganese (Mn), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), sulphate (SO42-), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), 96 \ncopper (Cu), nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), chloride (Cl), phosphate (PO43-), aluminium (Al), sodium 97 \n(Na), zinc (Zn) and alkalinity (CaCO3). Water quality is seldom monitored once a borehole has been 98 \nestablished due to financial and logistical constraints.  99 \n 100 \nStudies on the water quality in particular problem areas in Ghana have been conducted, such as the 101 \nnorthern parts (Pelig-Ba et al., 1991; Pelig-Ba, 1998; Pelig-Ba et al., 2001, 2004), along the coast (Gill, 102 \n1996) and in mining areas (Smedley, 1996; Pelig-Ba et al., 2001; Ahmad et al., 2004; Asante et al., 103 \nFinal author submission: Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2378\u20132386 \n 5\n2007; Buamah et al., 2008; Kortatsi et al., 2008b). In these mining areas, elevated concentrations of Fe, 104 \nMn, As, F-, Pb, Hg and Cr have been found in water sources, soil and air (Kortatsi, 1994; 105 \nAmonooNeizer et al., 1996; Golow et al., 1996; Obiri et al., 2006; Kortatsi et al., 2008b). Elevated 106 \nconcentrations of NO3- have also been found (Kortatsi et al., 2009), but further study is needed to 107 \nestablish the NO3- distribution in Ghana (British Geological Survey, 2000). Gill (1996) reported 108 \nbrackish water and high concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cl and NO3- in boreholes and wells in the Volta and 109 \nUpper and Northern regions. 110 \n 111 \nThe aim of this study was to gain an overview of the chemical water quality of drinking water sources 112 \nin the country, particularly of \u201cother improved\u201d sources such as wells and boreholes through a survey 113 \nof rural water supplies. The potential need for further treatment of the water is discussed in the context 114 \nof current water prices and how treatment and maintenance costs could be incorporated.  115 \n2. Materials and methods 116 \n2.1. Sample collection in Ghana 117 \n 118 \nA total of 230 samples were collected out of which 199 were from improved drinking water sources, 119 \nmainly boreholes and wells but also some standpipes and trucked water during the 2007 rainy season 120 \n(July\/August) from different regions throughout Ghana. In this paper we analyze the samples from the 121 \nimproved drinking water sources. Where possible the name of the location, age of the water source and 122 \npump, funding agency, water charge, money collection system, maintenance arrangements and 123 \nproximity of other water sources in the area were registered. Difficulties arose when trying to 124 \ndistinguish between boreholes and wells with hand pumps as information on the depth of the source 125 \nwas usually not available. However, the type of pump installed was used as an indication (see Asklund 126 \nand Eldvall (2005) for a detailed discussion on this problem). Samples were collected from the source 127 \nin 500 mL plastic bottles (washed three times with the sample water prior to collection), 20 mL of it 128 \nFinal author submission: Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2378\u20132386 \n 6\nfiltered through a 0.45 \u00b5m syringe filter (Sartorius Minisart, non-pyrogenic CE) and stored in a 20 mL 129 \npolypropylene vial. The pH of the remaining sample was checked upon collection and measured again 130 \nat the end of the day as was conductivity (Multiline P4 multimeter, WTW) and turbidity (Turbidimeter 131 \nTN-100, Eutech Instruments). Drinking water was likely to be exposed to the atmosphere before 132 \nconsumption as it was carried back in open basins and buckets and thus this reflects the pH which 133 \nwould be consumed. Filtered samples were stored at ambient temperature and airlifted to the UK at the 134 \ncompletion of the data collection. 135 \n 136 \n2.2. Chemical analysis 137 \n 138 \nThe samples were kept at 4\u00b0C and separated into two portions. One portion was acidified to pH < 2 139 \n(concentrated Aristar HNO3) and left to equilibrate at for at least 3 days before ICP analysis. The other 140 \nportion was kept untreated at 4\u00b0C for ion chromatography (IC) analysis. Laboratory blanks were prepared 141 \nby using MilliQ water and treating it in the same way as the samples. Major cations (> 0.1 mg\/L) were 142 \ndetected by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) (Perkin Elmer Optima 143 \n5300 DV, USA). Cations of concentrations as low as 0.01 \u00b5g\/L were analysed with inductively coupled 144 \nplasma \u2013 mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) (Agilent 7500ce, Japan). Calibrations were verified by a standard 145 \nreference material (ICP Multi Element Standard Solution VI CertiPUR) and a reference water (SRM 146 \n1640). Anions were analysed using IC (Dionex, CA, USA).  147 \n3. Results and discussion 148 \n3.3. Physico-chemical water quality 149 \nThe results from the chemical analysis (mean, minimum median, lower inter-quartile range (Q1), 150 \nmedian, higher inter-quartile range (Q3) and maximum values) are displayed in Table 1. The number of 151 \nsamples analysed (N), the applicable WHO drinking water guidelines and the percentage of samples 152 \nwith concentrations out with the guideline values are also presented. The following elements do 153 \nFinal author submission: Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2378\u20132386 \n 7\ncurrently not have a WHO guideline value: bromium (Br), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium 154 \n(K), sulphur (S), vanadium (V) and cobalt (Co). The following elements did not exceed the WHO 155 \nguideline value in any location: cadmium (Cd), selenium (Se), Copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cobalt (Co) and 156 \nchromium (Cr). The following elements exceeded the health-based WHO guideline value in at least 157 \none location: boron (B), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), uranium (U), fluoride (F-), 158 \nnitrate (NO3-), sulphate (SO42-) and nickel (Ni). The most widespread parameters exceeding a health 159 \nbased WHO guideline, were NO3- (21%), Mn (11%) and F- (6.7%). Numerous samples exceeded the 160 \nrecommended guidelines based on water treatment considerations or taste for Al (95%) and Cl (5.7%). 161 \nTurbidity and pH were also outside the recommended range for 90% and 53% of the samples, 162 \nrespectively. 163 \n 164 \n(Table 1) 165 \n 166 \n 167 \nSampling locations which contained parameters exceeding the WHO guideline for chemical quality are 168 \nshown in Figure 1. Only parameters of greatest concern are shown in this map (Fe, Mn, F-, B, As, Pb, 169 \nU, Cl and NO3-). It is important to note that the concentrations of the analytes are likely to be higher 170 \nduring the dry season (von der Heyden and New, 2004), and hence from a health aspect, the values 171 \ndisplayed are conservative since measured during the wet season.  172 \n 173 \n(Figure 1) 174 \n 175 \nAs can be seen in Figure 1, several water sources across the country contain concentrations of 176 \ninorganic contaminants above the WHO drinking water guideline. Many of the water sources along the 177 \ncoast had elevated TDS, due to proximity to the sea. High concentrations of NaCl are expected to some 178 \nextent due to seawater influence. Other ions such as F-, Mn, Fe and NO3- were also above the WHO 179 \nguideline along the coast. Further inland, a variety of elements exceeded the guideline value, in 180 \nFinal author submission: Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2378\u20132386 \n 8\nparticular in the Western, Central, Ashanti and Upper East Regions, where F- and NO3- concentrations 181 \nexceeded the guideline. Overall 38% of the samples exceeded the health-based WHO drinking water 182 \nguidelines for a minimum of one parameter. The graphs of pH, cumulative frequency versus 183 \nconcentration for TDS, conductivity, turbidity and the main inorganic parameters of interest are 184 \ndisplayed in Figure 2 to 5. This shows the range of the concentrations found and the percentage of 185 \nsamples found within a certain concentration. The dotted lines mark the WHO drinking water 186 \nguidelines, where applicable. A more detailed discussion of the individual contaminants found in the 187 \nwaters sources follows.  188 \n 189 \nThere is no health based guideline for pH, although a range of 6.5-8.5 is often used suggested because 190 \naquatic life is negatively affected below pH 6.0 (Mason, 1990). Additionally at low pH, the water is 191 \ncorrosive and can cause wear to equipment. About 50% of the samples fell outside the recommended 192 \npH range, with the majority being too acidic (Figure 2). Acidity is more prominent in environments 193 \nwith granite based rocks with low buffering capacity (Mason, 1990). Of particularly high acidity (pH 194 \n3.7) was a borehole close to the mining town Obuasi in the Ashanti Region. The borehole also had high 195 \nconcentrations of Al, Mn, Pb and NO3-, indicating contamination from mining. Other acidic waters (pH 196 \n4-5.5) were found in the Ashanti, Western and Central Region. Some had high concentrations of Al, 197 \nMn or Pb, indicating contamination from mining. These regions are also subject to much mining on 198 \nboth small and large scale. The Western, Central and Ashanti regions would be naturally more acidic 199 \nboth due to their geology (British Geological Survey, 2000) and due to forest coverage (Gill, 1996). 200 \nForests are naturally expected to be somewhat acidic, both due to the organic acids from the breakdown 201 \nof organic matter and the higher precipitation they receive (Spiro and Stigliani, 1996). This same area 202 \nalso receives the highest rainfall in the country (1500-2200 mm\/yr, compared to 700-1000 mm\/yr in the 203 \nnorthern parts and east coast) (Gill, 1996). 204 \n 205 \nFinal author submission: Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2378\u20132386 \n 9\n(Figure 2) 206 \n 207 \nTurbidity does not have a health based guideline, but it is recommended that it should ideally be below 208 \n0.1 NTU for effective disinfection (World Health Organisation, 2006). Ninety percent of the samples 209 \nwere above this guideline (Figure 3) and the turbidity was generally highest in surface waters, although 210 \nhigh values (up to 266 NTU) were also found in boreholes. Ghana has set a guideline for a newly 211 \ndrilled bore holes at 5 NTU; and about 80% of the water sources sampled complied with this value.  212 \n 213 \n(Figure 3) 214 \n 215 \nConductivity is an indication of the total dissolved solids (TDS), both organic and inorganic found in 216 \nthe water. There is no health-based guideline. The WHO guideline value of 1200 mg\/L for TDS is 217 \nbased on taste rather than health. High TDS may cause corrosion of equipment such as hand pumps.  218 \n 219 \n3.4. Parameters of health concern 220 \n 221 \nThe elements analysed for in this study that exceeded a WHO health based guideline value were As, 222 \nPb, U, B, F- and NO3-.  223 \n 224 \nThe WHO guideline value for arsenic (As) is 10 \u00b5g\/L. Concentrations exceeding this guideline were 225 \nfound in the Ashanti Region, around Obuasi, in the north of the Volta Region and  the Upper East 226 \n(Figure 4). The highest As concentration was in a borehole in Bolgatanga (170 \u00b5g\/L). Smedley (1996) 227 \nand Kinniburgh (Smedley, 1996; Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002) give a detailed description of As 228 \ngeochemistry and its mobility due to weathering conditions. As can for instance be mobilised by 229 \nflooding and the reduction and mobilisation of As-containing Fe oxides, or by oxidation of 230 \nFinal author submission: Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2378\u20132386 \n 10\narsenopyrates, which is the case in the gold mining areas of Ghana (Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002). 231 \nSimilarly high As concentrations were measured by Asante (2007) in the Tarkwa gold mining region 232 \n(Western Region). Bolgatanga is an active mining area, and may thus release naturally occurring As. 233 \nAsante et al. (2007) measured As concentrations in human urine samples of inhabitants of Tarkwa, 234 \nconcluding that the concentrations were similar to those of concentrations found in e.g. Bangladesh and 235 \nIndia, although they could not ascertain a link to drinking water. As concentrations in rivers were 236 \nhigher than boreholes, indicating air-borne contamination (Smedley, 1996). Kortatsi et al. (2008b) 237 \nfound that 21% of the boreholes in the Offin basin (Ashanti Region) contain As concentrations above 238 \nthe WHO guideline. Interestingly, Amonoo-Neizer and Amekor (1993)  showed that crops grown close 239 \nto Obuasi often had double As contents compared to the same crop types grown around Kumasi 240 \nindicating the release of high concentrations of As in mining areas. Kortatsi (2008a) also identified a 241 \nnumber of samples with As concentrations above the drinking water guideline in the Central, Greater 242 \nAccra and Volta Region. From the results of this study, it does not appear that As is a widespread 243 \nproblem in Ghana, however, it is still important to monitor and regulate contamination from mining 244 \nactivities as very high localised concentrations occur. 245 \n 246 \n(Figure 4) 247 \n 248 \nHigh concentrations of lead (Pb), above the WHO guideline value 10 \u00b5g\/L, were found in the Ashanti 249 \nregion, as well as on the coast. The highest concentration determined was 35 \u00b5g\/L. Concentrations of 250 \nPb above the WHO guideline in wells and boreholes imply that groundwater sources are not 251 \nnecessarily safe from pollution from industrial activities. The high Pb concentrations found at very low 252 \npH, and south of Obuasi, indicating acid mine drainage or other mining contamination as a possible 253 \nsource.  254 \n 255 \nFinal author submission: Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2378\u20132386 \n 11\nConcentrations of uranium (U) above the provisional WHO guideline (15 \u00b5g\/L) were found in the 256 \nCentral Region and the Volta Region. The Volta Region sample also had high concentrations of NO3- 257 \n(508 mg\/L, ten times the WHO guideline value), F- (4.24 mg\/L, nearly three times the guideline value) 258 \nand Cl (500 mg\/L, double the taste guideline value). The borehole containing most U (267 \u00b5g\/L) was in 259 \nthe Central Region. It did not contain other chemical pollutants. Other boreholes in that area also 260 \ncontained U, although below the drinking water guideline value. U was previously found by Dampare 261 \n(2005). Concentrations below the drinking water guideline were also found in found in the Upper East, 262 \nindicating that while U might not be a widespread concern, it may be worth monitoring as it is a natural 263 \npart of the geology. As well as being naturally radioactive, U is chemically toxic and when ingested 264 \nmay target bones or damage the kidney (The Royal Society, 2002; Kurttio et al., 2005). 265 \n 266 \nBoron (B) was found at levels up to 2034 \u00b5g\/L (the WHO guideline value is 500 \u00b5g\/L) in the Northern 267 \nRegion. The highest B concentrations corresponded with alkaline pH. Speciation models of the water 268 \n(using Minteq 2.53, results not shown), showed B to exist mainly as boric acid (H3BO3) over the acidic 269 \nto neutral pH range, and borate (H2BO3-) above pH 8.5. Sources of boron include seawater (unlikely in 270 \nthis situation), coal burning and industrial sources as well as borate-containing fertilizers, which may 271 \nbe the most likely source in this case as there is agricultural activity in the region.  272 \n 273 \nAbout 6.7% of the samples contained fluoride (F-) concentrations above the WHO guideline value (1.5 274 \nmg\/L) (Figure 4). High concentrations of F- were found in the north, but also in many locations along 275 \nthe coast, mainly in wells and boreholes. In the Upper East about 17% of the samples contained F- 276 \nconcentrations above the guideline. Boreholes near the coast in the Volta Region contained F- 277 \nconcentrations of above 4 mg\/L, which can cause skeletal fluorosis. Kortatsi (2008b) also found F- 278 \nconcentrations of 11 mg\/L in the Offin Basin (Ashanti Region).   279 \n 280 \nFinal author submission: Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2378\u20132386 \n 12\n(Figure 5) 281 \n 282 \nNitrate (NO3-) has a WHO guideline value of 50 mg\/L and exceeded this concentration in 21% of the 283 \nsamples (Figure 5). The highest concentration was 508 mg\/L. The locations were widespread but 284 \nmostly found in the Western, Ashanti, southern Volta, Northern region and Upper East. NO3- is 285 \nregulated as it is one of the causes of methaemoglobinaemia (or \u201cblue-baby syndrome\u201d) in infants 286 \n(Manassaram et al., 2006) as well as a potential risk of stomach cancer (Abrahams, 2002). Forty-seven 287 \npercent of the well waters had concentrations above the guideline, compared to 16% of the borehole 288 \nwaters (Figure 6). The concentrations of NO3- were also higher in wells than in surface water (results 289 \nnot shown). This indicates a widespread problem of elevated NO3- in shallow groundwater \u2013probably a 290 \nresult of poor sanitation and latrine construction (MacDonald and Calow, 2009). High levels can also 291 \nbe caused by fertilizer use. The results of Pelig-Ba (2004) confirm those of this study and report a mean 292 \nof 93.3 mg\/L of NO3- and a maximum of 511 mg\/L in groundwater in the Upper West. The WHO 293 \nguideline value for nitrite (NO22-) is 0.2 mg\/L. Unfortunately NO22- needs to be determined within 48 294 \nhours, which was not possible due to the logistics. Thus the NO3- values reported in this paper, include 295 \nany NO22- which may have been originally present.  296 \n 297 \n(Figure 6) 298 \n 299 \n3.5. Aesthetic parameters  300 \n 301 \nParameters analysed for in this study with non-health based WHO guidelines were Al, Fe, Mn, Cl and 302 \nSO42-. Despite not being a health concern, high concentrations affect the quality of water, leading to bad 303 \ntaste and colouration of cooking utensils and food. This has caused hundreds of wells to be abandoned in 304 \nFinal author submission: Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2378\u20132386 \n 13\nfavour of surface waters likely contaminated with harmful micro-organisms (Smedley, 1996; Gyau-305 \nBoakye and Dapaah-Siakwan, 1999). 306 \n 307 \nThe most widespread pollutant was aluminium (Al). The health effects from Al remain unclear, however, 308 \nAl does have a practicable non-health based WHO guideline value of 0.2 mg\/L (stated as an achievable 309 \nlevel for small water treatment facilities. This takes into consideration the health concerns but also the 310 \nbenefits from using Al in water treatment (World Health Organisation, 2006)). Ninety-five percent of the 311 \nsamples measured were above the recommended guideline value (Figure 5), several more than ten-fold, 312 \nwith the maximum concentration at 67 mg\/L. Areas of particularly high Al concentration were in the 313 \nVolta Region (regional average of 27 mg\/L) where Nkwanta district, Asuogyaman, Hohoe, Keta and 314 \nKetu districts had especially high concentrations (average of 30, 42, 28, 55 and 44 mg\/L respectively). 315 \nThe Western Region also had locations containing high Al concentrations, with an average of 13 mg\/L in 316 \nthe Wassa West district. Al may leach from soils unable to buffer acidic precipitation and from minerals 317 \nsuch as kaolinite and gibbsite (Langmuir, 1997). Some researchers find high Al concentrations in 318 \nassociation with particles (Reimann et al., 2003), in our study however, Al showed no correlation with 319 \nturbidity. Al concentrations were found to be highest around neutral pH, where Al normally is less 320 \nsoluble. The high Al in the samples may possibly be associated with colloids smaller than the 0.45 \u00b5m 321 \nfilter. Pelig-Ba (2004) also found higher Al concentrations in water at neutral pH and explained it by 322 \npresence of chelating agents such as soil organic matter raising the Al solubility. In Pelig-Ba\u2019s study from 323 \nthe Upper Regions (1998) the Al range was reported as up to 47 mg\/L, with a mean of 4.4 mg\/L in the 324 \nNorthern Region. 325 \n 326 \nA number of samples had very high sulphate (SO42-) concentrations (>500 mg\/L) (Figure 5). One was 327 \nfound in a relatively new borehole in the Northern Region, probably due to mudstone geology. In this 328 \nsample high Mn concentrations were also found. Due to the taste, consumers preferred to drink water 329 \nFinal author submission: Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2378\u20132386 \n 14\nfrom the nearby shallow well, which contained low SO42- and Mn concentrations but possible 330 \nmicrobiological contamination. This illustrates how poor chemical water quality of new deeper 331 \ngroundwater sources may drive people back to shallow contaminated sources. Another borehole from 332 \nthe same region contained similar SO42- and TDS levels, but no Mn, and people were happy to drink 333 \nthe water. 334 \n 335 \nAround 5.7% of the waters sampled contain more chloride (Cl) than the recommended value (250 336 \nmg\/L) (Figure 5). This value is based on taste, but waters of these Cl concentrations are also more 337 \ncorrosive. As can be seen from the map in Figure 1, much of the high Cl concentrations are found in 338 \nthe Volta delta and along the coast. Gill et al. (1996) also reported high Cl concentrations in the Keta 339 \ndistrict and found similar evidence of seawater intrusion. A study conducted by Kortatsi (2006) in the 340 \nAccra plains similarly found high concentrations of Cl and concluded that 75% of the boreholes in the 341 \narea were brackish (TDS range 1000-10000 mg\/L), with Na and Cl as the dominating ions.  342 \n 343 \nIron (Fe) concentrations below 2000 \u00b5g\/L are described as safe by the WHO (Figure 4), although taste 344 \nis affected above 300 \u00b5g\/L. This taste based value is used by many studies when reporting Fe. Up to 345 \n4257 \u00b5g\/L was measured. As can be seen from the map (Figure 1), high Fe concentrations were found 346 \nin a variety of locations along the coast, inland in forested areas and the Northern Region. Most 347 \nsamples (97.4%) fall below 300 \u00b5g\/L and 99% are below the guideline value 2000 \u00b5g\/L (Figure 4). 348 \nMost of the sources containing very high Fe concentrations were found in boreholes. The chemistry of 349 \nnaturally occuring Fe is controlled by the redox conditions of the water (not measured due to lack of 350 \nequipment), where Fe is mobilised under reducing conditions, indicating that the environment of these 351 \nboreholes was reducing. 352 \n 353 \nFinal author submission: Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2378\u20132386 \n 15\nConcentrations of manganese (Mn) above the WHO drinking water guideline value (400 \u03bcg\/L) were 354 \nfound mainly the Western and Ashanti region and along the coast (Figure 1). The highest 355 \nconcentrations were found in boreholes (Figure 6). Similarly to Fe, Mn chemistry is also redox 356 \ncontrolled. High concentrations of Fe and Mn corresponded in some samples, but for the majority of 357 \nthem high Mn concentrations were not accompanied by high Fe concentrations. 358 \n 359 \nHigh concentrations of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K) (Figure 5) are generally not 360 \na health concern and thus do not have guideline values set by the WHO, but are important nutrients. 361 \nStudies have shown an inverse relationship between cardiovascular disease and water hardness, with 362 \nincreased risk occurring with Ca concentrations <60mg\/L of Ca (Packham, 1990). In fact the water 363 \nsources in Ghana were relatively soft and the concentrations of the samples in the third percentile were 364 \nbelow 15 mg\/L for Mg and 40 mg\/L for Ca (Table 1). In large concentrations however, they may affect 365 \nthe taste of the water by contributing to high TDS, which will also affect practical water usage 366 \n(washing with soap).  367 \n 368 \nIn summary, the water quality from the different sources in Ghana displayed a wide range of chemical 369 \nwater quality, with many sources containing concentrations above the drinking water guidelines. In 370 \nboreholes high concentrations of NO3-, F-, B, Pb, As, U, Cl, Fe, Mn and SO42-, and high levels turbidity 371 \nwere found. In wells NO3-, Fe and turbidity were common problems, as well as some instances of As, 372 \nMn, Cl and F-.  373 \n 374 \n3.6. Current rural water sources, costs and ability to pay 375 \nThe Ghana Water Policy advocates provision of demand driven basic water and sanitation services for 376 \ncommunities that contribute towards capital cost, operation, maintenance and repairs (Government of 377 \nFinal author submission: Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2378\u20132386 \n 16\nGhana, 2007). Non-government organisations often support the communities by paying up to 95% of 378 \nthe borehole cost, while the community raises 5% of the borehole cost (Government of Ghana, 2007).  379 \n 380 \nAbout 25% of the communities visited had an annual user fee per household ranging from 5000 to 381 \n40000 cedis (\u00a30.3-\u00a321, August 2007). About 33% of the water supplies had a water collection charge 382 \nbased on quantity of water collected (Figure 7). Surface and many well waters were often free of 383 \ncharge while boreholes, piped and especially truck-delivered water attracted the highest charges. The 384 \ncost per bucket (18L) for boreholes and piped water ranged from 25 to 250 cedis (\u00a30.07 to \u00a30.7\/m3, 385 \nbased on 62 communities) and the cost per basin (40L) ranged from 50 to 500 cedis (\u00a30.07 to \u00a30.7\/m3, 386 \nbased on 47 communities). Where water was trucked in, the cost was 1000-1200 cedis per bucket 387 \n(\u00a32.9-3.5\/m3, based on two communities). An appointed water vendor from the WatSan committee was 388 \noften situated at the water source to directly collect the payment from the users. Understandably some 389 \nhouseholds choose to use cheaper or free water sources for washing and bathing, increasing the risk of 390 \ncontact with diseases transmitted by surface water. Surface water is often used during the rainy season 391 \ndue to availability while in dry seasons they may be used if borehole re-charge is low (Iten and 392 \nMcCarron, 2006). 13% of the communities visited did not have an operational payment system in 393 \nplace. Many communities were therefore struggling to raise between 1.5-2.5 million cedis (about \u00a380-394 \n\u00a3130) in order to pay for repairs or spare parts of pumps, broken a couple of years earlier. When this 395 \nproved to be a major hurdle and pumps would remain disused or even abandoned. Another problem 396 \nencountered in some communities was that there was no payment system for the trained community 397 \nmembers to get paid for maintenance services, which meant that they were unwilling to assist. 398 \nOrganising maintenance and collecting payment for repairs is further complicated by the dynamic 399 \nmovement of people between different communities and even parts of the country (Iten and McCarron, 400 \n2006). In some cases pumps were ill designed, causing unaffordable chronic failure of parts. 401 \n 402 \nFinal author submission: Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2378\u20132386 \n 17\n 403 \n(Figure 7) 404 \n 405 \n 406 \n3.7. Is water treatment a suitable option for sources of poor chemical quality?  407 \nThe problems encountered in the survey were those of high turbidity, high concentrations of F-, NO3-, 408 \nAl, Mn, Fe and localised contamination of Pb, As, B and U. Overall, 38% of the sources analysed 409 \nexceeded a health-based WHO guideline for chemical parameters. Installation costs of boreholes and 410 \nwells are about \u00a33800 and \u00a31800, respectively. Many boreholes fail due to the high chemical content of 411 \nfor example F- (Smedley et al., 2002) and up to 64% of the boreholes in the north of Ghana fail based 412 \non water flow, re-charge and chemical quality (Iten and McCarron, 2006). Thus for the actual costs of 413 \ndeveloping ground water the number of unsuccessful boreholes drilled need to be taken into account. 414 \nTo reduce this cost in areas of complex geology, investment in initial hydrogeological investigations is 415 \nimportant to improve success (MacDonald and Calow, 2009). An alternative option to capping existing 416 \nboreholes and drilling new, potentially unsuccessful boreholes would be to treat the water. Suitable 417 \ntreatment options in developing countries can be provided as centralised, community based or point-of-418 \nuse\/household based approaches. For economic and infrastructural reasons, community based or point-419 \nof-use treatments are considered preferable to centralised treatment for rural communities (Peter-420 \nVarbanets et al., 2009). This also applies to rural areas of Ghana where boreholes or wells may already 421 \nexist while access to a centralised supply does not. Treatment technologies considered suitable for 422 \ndeveloping countries, such as sand filtration, UV disinfection (SODIS), ceramic filters and chlorination 423 \nmainly remove or destroy microbial pathogens and turbidity (Sobsey et al., 2008; Peter-Varbanets et 424 \nal., 2009) and could potentially be used to disinfect surface waters of good chemical quality, but do not 425 \neffectively remove chemical contaminants. Importantly, over 90% of the samples had a turbidity of 426 \nmore than 0.1 NTU, which must be reduced before disinfection can be effective. 427 \n 428 \nFinal author submission: Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2378\u20132386 \n 18\nTreatment methods which target chemical contaminants combine processes such as adsorption or 429 \ncoagulation with ultrafiltration or sandfiltration processes (Brandhuber and Amy, 2001; Johnston and 430 \nHeijnen, 2001; Chakravarty et al., 2002). Issues of handling, cost of chemicals, sanitation and 431 \nregeneration of the adsorption materials are a concern. Ultrafiltration systems are available at an 432 \ninvestment cost of about \u00a32000 (20 m3\/day capacity), and are maintained by a daily washing. Low-cost 433 \nAs removal for communities in developing countries have been investigated (Bissen and Frimmel, 434 \n2003b; Malik et al., 2009) and wells can even be constructed to allow re-circulation of oxidised water 435 \nback into the source, thus oxidising and immobilising Fe and As before it is with-drawn (van Halem et 436 \nal., 2009). This method still requires further development and testing, however, and the resulting 437 \nconcentrations depend on concentrations originally present. The need to remove a variety of chemical 438 \ncontaminants from existing water sources persists and long-term studies are lacking. The issue of F- 439 \nremoval from drinking water in the northern regions of Ghana, for example, is unresolved (CWSA, 440 \n2007). In such situations membrane technologies have unique potential due to their physical separation. 441 \nNanofiltration or reverse osmosis are well adapted in developed countries for water desalination, reuse 442 \nand removal of dissolved contaminants while application in developing countries has not yet widely 443 \nprogressed. Investment cost into single tap reverse osmosis has been estimated to \u00a3190-\u00a3380 (Peter-444 \nVarbanets et al., 2009) which may be an option if it could be developed for boreholes. A solar powered 445 \ncommunity-based membrane system was field tested by Sch\u00e4fer et al. (2007) and found to perform 446 \nwell in terms of potable water production. The system had a specific energy consumption of 1.2 447 \nkWh\/m3. Investment and maintenance costs into a solar powered electrodialysis systems have been 448 \ncalculated as \u00a30.15-0.28\/m3, with an initial investment of at least \u00a35400 (Ortiz et al., 2008).  However, 449 \nthe long-term integration of operation and maintenance of such systems into communities requires 450 \nsolid strategies at a local level.  451 \n 452 \nFinal author submission: Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2378\u20132386 \n 19\n3.8. Sustainability of treatment systems 453 \nThe effectiveness and sustainability of point-of-use and small-scale water treatment technology 454 \nremains to be seen as contentious (see for example Hunter (in press), Hunter et al. (2009) and Schmidt 455 \nand Cairncross (in press)).  Three components of sustainability for engineered solutions in developing 456 \ncountries were identified by Montgomery et al. (2009) as 1) effective community demand, 2) local 457 \nfinancing and cost recovery, and 3) dynamic operation and maintenance. The importance of local 458 \nownership of both the technology development (local sourcing and production) as well as the resulting 459 \nsystems should be emphasized. Failure to incorporate these components into a water source and 460 \npotential water treatment reduce the likelihood of its long-term functionality.  Cost recovery of five 461 \ncommunity managed water systems in the Ashanti Region was investigated by Nyarko et al. (2007), 462 \nwho found that neither of the communities recovered their full capital and operational costs, while four 463 \nout of five recovered their operation and maintenance costs. Interview results showed that there was not 464 \nan understanding amongst the community members of the full costs involved, while some preferred to 465 \nuse free untreated water sources when the prices were too high. The importance of demand-driven 466 \nappropriate water treatment was high-lighted in a study by Hoque et al. (2004). They found that 467 \nhousehold treatment systems often were abandoned after a short period, while community based 468 \nsystems proved more sustainable. For this reason it is important to understand the willingness (and 469 \nability) to pay for water provision in such communities as well as elucidating the most suitable 470 \ntreatment option. 471 \n 472 \n4. Conclusions 473 \nIt was found in this study that 38% of the wells and boreholes in Ghana had high concentrations of 474 \ninorganic contaminants. Major problems identified were that of high turbidity, low pH, high 475 \nconcentrations of NO3-, F-, Al and Cl and in localised areas As, Pb, B and U. The importance of regular 476 \nFinal author submission: Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2378\u20132386 \n 20\nmonitoring of groundwater sources is emphasized. While some \u2018low-cost\u2019 treatment technologies to 477 \nremove, for instance, As and F- exist, the long-term sustainability and management of such 478 \ntechnologies is yet to be proven for a wide range of chemical contaminants and how performance (in 479 \nparticular contaminant breakthrough) can be monitored. The maintenance costs of systems could 480 \npotentially be incorporated in the maintenance costs currently paid by community members (up to 481 \n\u00a30.7\/m3), especially if government and NGO\u2019s were willing to invest in the capital costs. This could be 482 \nworthwhile, considering the cost of unsuccessful boreholes. About 58% of the communities had a 483 \npayment system in place to recover basic maintenance costs.  484 \n 485 \nIn areas of high chemical contamination more advanced inorganic removal treatment such as 486 \nnanofiltration and reverse osmosis may be necessary. This would require extensive training in 487 \noperation and maintenance, but while initial investment would increase, it may facilitate maintenance 488 \nand potentially reduce long-term costs in particular if renewable energy is used as a power supply. 489 \nGiven that renewable energy powered ground water pumps are rapidly penetrating the market and 490 \nwater charges for trucked water is comparable to membrane treatment costs this is a most viable option. 491 \nAny form of improved water supply requires community ownership and commitment by local and 492 \nnational authorities to ensure that long-term needs are met. Research into ensuring long-term 493 \nsustainability in terms of community demand, cost recovery, failure management, maintenance of 494 \nwater sources and treatment needed is timely and of critical importance. 495 \n 496 \n5.
