Multimedia Motion enables students to\nchart and analyse a range of movements: displacement, velocities, accelerations, etc. of a variety of\npeople and vehicles. During the pilot phase of the project, we conducted an evaluation of the CD-\nROM-based activities. The evaluation consisted of observations of teacher and student use of the\nmaterial in two schools, augmented with data obtained from questionnaires administered in a further\ntwo schools. The resulting data raises a number of issues about how exploratory learning can best be\nsupported by multimedia. We observed the expected benefits of increased motivation for learners\nbecause of access to more realistic applications of the laws of physics illustrated on the disc. However,\nseveral others factors appeared to be important to students when using it. In this paper, we explore how\nteachers' and students' perceptions of the task involved in learning post-16 physics must be addressed in\ndesigning suitable multimedia presentations and exercises.\nIntroduction\nMultimedia Motion is a CD-ROM, designed by Gill Graham and David Glover, for\nteaching post-16 students about dynamics. It allows students to select data from moving\nbodies (such as space rockets and tennis players), and to explore how that data can be\ndisplayed graphically and what the relationships are between distance moved, velocity,\nacceleration, impulse, momentum, etc.\nUse of parts of the disc is incorporated into the Supported Learning in Physics (SLIP)\nprogramme, and it is in this context that the evaluation of its use reported here was\ncarried out.\nThe SLIP Project\nThe SLIP Project is a curriculum development programme, led by the Open University, to\n65\n\u00a3 White\/egg et al Multimedia Motion: motivating learners \u2022\nprovide flexible, supported learning materials for students studying for A or AS level\nphysics or GNVQ advanced science or engineering. The materials are currently at various\nstages of development, and should be ready for use by post-16 students in the autumn\nterm of 1997 (a description of the SLIP project can be found in Whitelegg, 1996). The\nmaterials are all text-based, but some authors are incorporating multimedia into their\nstudy units, and it is in this context that Multimedia Motion is used. It is currently used for\nfour 'explorations' in the unit Physics on the Move (which teaches dynamics and statics),\nand is also used in the unit Physics for Sport The CD-ROM complements the laboratory-\nbased practical work incorporated in the units, and reinforces a core educational strategy\nused in SLIP: that of teaching the physics content through real-life contexts.\nMotivation\nTeaching through real-life contexts has been shown to increase motivation for learning\n(Hennessy, 1993), and this strategy is employed throughout the SLIP materials. The\ncontexts for the Physics on the Move unit is the safe transportation of people and goods,\nand for the Physics for Sport unit the contexts of rock climbing, springboard diving and\nscuba diving are all used to teach forces, vectors, oscillations and pressure. The\nMultimedia Motion disc asks students to examine videos of car and train crashes, people\njogging, playing various sports, etc., and thus reinforces the real-life approach introduced\nin the text materials. Because of this approach, Multimedia Motion is more consistent\nwith the philosophy of the project than certain computer simulations which could have\nbeen used instead. The disc also uses examples of laboratory-based experiments, such as\nthe linear air track to teach momentum and kinetic energy. These can be compared with\nreal experiments done by students in the school or college laboratory. In addition to\nincreasing motivation for learning physics through the use of real-life contexts, it was felt\nthat the inclusion of the CD-ROM would increase motivation in students who might\nperceive it as a new and exciting way to learn, particularly for those who already used\nCD-ROMs for entertainment.\nThe evaluation\nThe evaluation of the use of the disc was carried out in parallel with, but separately from,\nan evaluation of the text material (Abraham, 1996). Separate teams undertook the text\nand CD-ROM evaluations, although the same schools and colleges were used for both.\nThe aim of the evaluation was to determine whether the incorporation and use of the disc\nin the project's materials was realistic or not, and whether it could provide an effective\nlearning experience which might replace some conventional laboratory-based practical\nexperiments. Yilditz and Atkins (1993) suggest a wide range of aspects of multimedia to\nbe addressed in any evaluation. Our eclectic approach was that advocated by Jones et al\n(1996).\nEvaluation method\nObservations were carried out at two schools. One was involved in the evaluation of the\nSLIP project texts, and the other acted as a control school. These observations involved\n12 students in around 60 hours of computer-based activity, and the resulting data is in the\nform of videotape records, observation schedules and student self-reports.\n66\nALT-] Volume 5 Number \/\nTo confirm our findings from the observations, we devised two questionnaires about\nstudents' use of the disc, one for students themselves, the other for their teachers. The\nquestionnaires asked them about their previous experience, and their perceptions of the\nadvantages\/disadvantages, of using computers in physics lessons, their use of CD-ROMs\ngenerally, and about the Multimedia Motion disc and the particular sequences on it\nwhich they used. Students were asked to compare the Multimedia Motion explorations to\nreal practical work, to compare watching practical demonstrations in the laboratory with\nwatching videos in computer simulations, and to report on how much teacher-support\nthey needed in order to use the disc. These questionnaires were sent to the schools and\ncolleges involved in the evaluation of the SLIP Project. Twenty-one questionnaires were\nreturned.\nEvaluation outcomes\nIncreased motivation for learners\nWe observed some of the expected benefits of increased motivation for learners because\nof access to more realistic applications of the laws of physics illustrated on the disc, as\npredicted by one of the authors of this paper, Hatzipanagos, at a presentation given in\n1995 at CAL'95 in Cambridge. Some students wrote that Multimedia Motion made\nphysics more fun, and provided a variation in the approach to the subject, though not all\nagreed ('The Multimedia Motion explorations offer more accurate results and an easier\nway of obtaining them, but are not as much fun as performing the real experiments').\nSupport for exploratory learning styles\nThroughout the observations, most students did not use the disc to its full extent. The\nSLIP material which incorporates the use of the disc directs students to undertake\nparticular activities and provides some questions to answer resulting from its use.\nHowever, students often ignored these instructions, and once they had got Multimedia\nMotion running, their use of it became rather unstructured. The disc provides data-files\nwhich students need for solving physics problems, and there was often a reluctance to\nembark on these problems, particularly if calculations were involved. Without teacher\ninput, either in the form of teacher-directed problems to be solved through use of the disc,\nor monitoring and help provided by the teacher during its use, there was a tendency for\nless motivated, less able students to jump around the various contents without engaging\nwith them very constructively. Also, as most students used the disc in pairs or groups of\nthree, some just observed others using it, and did not interact with it themselves. This led\nto a passive experience, similar to watching a video.\nPractical work and computer-based activities\nIn general, students felt that the computer-based activities on the disc had some\nadvantages for learning dynamics over laboratory-based practical work. Typical\ncomments were that the disc gave 'examples of real situations where realistic data can be\nmanipulated and understanding made easier', and that the explorations 'can be used\nfaster than doing all the experiments for yourself. There were also positive student\ncomments concerning the ease of printing out information, the reliability of results, and\nthe usefulness of a frame-by-frame feature of the software. One teacher commented that\nstudents concentrated on data rather than on setting up and adjusting physical\nequipment. There were, however, some opposing views from students, such as that 'much\nof the learning stems from mistakes made in real practicals', and that Multimedia Motion\n67\n\u00a3 Whitelegg et al Multimedia Motion: motivating learners\n'lacks the hands-on feel of a practical lesson [and] some of the problem-solving elements\nof setting up a practical'. One student wrote: 'Seeing something for yourself in real life\nleads you to believe it more', while another wrote: 'More is learned by doing practical\nexperiments than by looking at the computer screen' (our italics).\nDifficulties with graphing\nMany students had difficulty in interpreting the graphs that their data produced. This was\nsometimes due to the data points they selected, but they were also sometimes left confused\nand frustrated because they had not attained the outcome they expected. They\ncomplained that they could not ask the computer questions in the same way as they\nwould normally ask their teacher.\nSchool\/college mode of use\nIn nearly every case, the use of the disc was limited by the number of computers with CD-\nROM drives available in the school or college. In both the institutions where observations\ntook place, only one computer was available for students to use the disc. The results of\nthe postal questionnaires also indicated limited use because of lack of hardware.\nConclusions\nThere are certain learning styles which, it is claimed, multimedia can support, among\nthem exploratory learning (see, for example, Laurillard, 1993). But for students of this\nage and relative inexperience, multimedia may not be effective on its own. The students in\nthis study needed more teacher intervention and to be provided with problem-solving\nactivities which required their interaction with the disc. This would also encourage the\nmore passive students to interact with it, and the more dominant ones to share the use of\nthe computer.\nThe lack of hardware was a problem in every institution which responded, and prevented\nthe disc from being built into the core of the teaching programme. It tended to be used as\nan added extra outside the main curriculum, or for revision.\nThe creators of this disc have now produced a Teachers' Pack which may help to solve\nsome of the problems. However, while Multimedia Motion provides an alternative to\nsome laboratory-based practical work, without frequent teacher intervention, students\nwill probably not make effective use of all that it offers. It can provide an effective\nlearning experience, particularly for high-ability, motivated students, but for others it\ndoes so only with substantial teacher support and monitoring. Multimedia in this form is\nnot stand-alone but is a useful and enjoyable way for students to increase their learning in\na conceptually difficult area of physics, and to relate it to real-life situations in an\ninteractive way. As one student put it: 'Lab-based and multimedia approaches should\nboth be used to complement each other.'\nReferences\nAbraham, G.
