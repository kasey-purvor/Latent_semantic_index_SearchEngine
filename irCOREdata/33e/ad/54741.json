New farfield data from the Woodland, 24 \nThrockley and Rowlands Gill boreholes in northern England allow this inconsistency to 25 \nbe addressed. \u03b418O from well-preserved late Serpukhovian (late Pendleian to early 26 \nArnsbergian) Woodland brachiopods vary between \u20133.4 and \u20136.3\u2030, and \u03b413C varies 27 \nbetween \u20132.0 and +3.2\u2030, suggesting a \u03b418O seawater (w) value of around \u20131.8\u2030 28 \nVSMOW, and therefore an absence of widespread ice-caps. The organic carbon \u03b413C 29 \nupward increasing trend in the Throckley Borehole (Serpukhovian to Bashkirian; c. \u201324 30 \nto c. \u201322\u2030), and the Rowlands Gill Borehole (Serpukhovian; c. \u201324 to c. \u201323\u2030) suggests 31 \nlarge-scale burial of organic material, probably in burgeoning lycophyte-dominated coal 32 \nforest, implying a fall in pCO2. \u03c1CO2reduction appears not to have caused large-scale 33 \nglaciation until the early Bashkirian, but a scenario of coalescing upland icecaps through 34 \nthe Serpukhovian with a background of decreasing \u03c1CO2, appears to be similar to the 35 \nprocess that initiated Cenozoic Antarctic glaciation. 36 \nKeywords: Namurian, glaciation, isotopes, brachiopods, foraminifera 37 \n 38 \n 39 \nThe mechanism and timing of the initiation of major glaciation in the Carboniferous are 40 \nnot well understood (Frank et al. 2008). Farfield carbonate fossils allow the examination 41 \nof the carbon cycle through carbon isotope ratios (\u03b413C), while oxygen isotope ratios 42 \n 3\n(\u03b418O) serve as proxies for temperature and ice volume (Grossman et al. 2008). \u03b413C 43 \nvalues of terrestrial organic matter (plant fossils, cuticles, humic coals and bulk terrestrial 44 \nmaterial) are related to large-scale carbon cycle changes such as burial of carbon in 45 \ndecomposition-resistant lignin and reduction in atmospheric \u03c1CO2. However, the 46 \ninterplay of these factors in individual periods of accelerated change requires careful 47 \nstudy. One such period is the Serpukhovian Stage (early Namurian; Pendleian \u2013 48 \nArnsbergian; Fig. 1) at which time glacial facies in South America, eastern Australia and 49 \nTibet became established (see Isbell et al. 2003; Gonz\u00e1lez-Bonorino & Eyles 1995; 50 \nFielding et al. 2008a). This period, the start of Glacial II of Isbell et al. (2003), is rather 51 \npoorly represented in terms of farfield oxygen and carbon isotopic data (Batt et al. 2007).  52 \nIn eastern Australia, Glacial II begins with a short glacial period (termed C1; Fielding et 53 \nal. 2008a; Fig. 1) starting at 326.5 Ma (Menning et al. 2000) with duration about 1Ma. 54 \nThis is recorded in only two locations, one of which is dated by SHRIMP U-Pb (Fielding 55 \net al. 2008a; their fig 2). A period without evidence for eastern Australian glaciation 56 \nfollowed between 325 and 322 Ma, comprising the middle part of the Serpukhovian (late 57 \nPendleian and early Arnsbergian; Gradstein et al. 2004). Isbell et al. (2003) considered 58 \nthere to be evidence for glaciation in this period outside eastern Australia, in South 59 \nAmerica and Tibet, based on correlations with the Levipustula Biozone in Australia (Fig. 60 \n1). A more widespread \u2018C2\u2019 glaciation is recognised in the late Serpukhovian (322.5 \u2013 61 \n319.5 Ma, according to Fielding et al. 2008a), recorded in four separate locations in 62 \nQueensland and New South Wales. 63 \nThe recent compilation of Frank et al. (2008) for brachiopods brought together the few 64 \nSerpukhovian data from the US midcontinent and Russian platform (Veizer et al. 1999 65 \n 4\nand Mii et al. 1999) and confirmed the wide range of \u03b418Ocarb and \u03b413Ccarb values (e.g. 66 \n\u03b418Ocarb = \u20138.16 to \u20131.03\u2030 for the Donetsk Arnsbergian D5\/1 Zone) for single horizons 67 \nwith corresponding low \u03b413Ccarb. They thus noted a discrepancy between presumed onset 68 \nof glacial activity in the early Serpukhovian and isotopic trends which suggest low ice 69 \nvolume until the early Bashkirian when brachiopod carbonate \u03b418O increased (see also 70 \nBuggisch et al. 2008). This discrepancy, the low sampling density and the wide range of 71 \nvalues from single horizons indicate the need for new studies of accurately dated 72 \nSerpukhovian sections with well preserved brachiopods. 73 \nThe carbon isotope composition of terrestrial organic matter (\u03b413Corg) potentially has 74 \ngreater ability to track carbon cycle changes because of the ubiquitous nature of organic 75 \nmatter within sedimentary rocks. A detailed record of Serpukhovian \u03b413Corg has yet to be 76 \npresented and analysed in the context of isotopic, glacial or climate change. Strauss & 77 \nPeters-Kottig (2003) and Peters-Kottig et al. (2006) measured \u03b413Corg from terrestrial 78 \norganic matter from plant fossils, cuticles, humic coals and bulk terrestrial material 79 \nthroughout the Late Palaeozoic. High values of terrestrial \u03b413Corg (\u201321\u2030 to \u201322\u2030) 80 \nbetween the early Mississippian and the Early Permian were attributed to the rise of large 81 \nvascular land plants and associated burial of carbon in decomposition-resistant lignin. A 82 \nlong, low-gradient \u03b413Corg increasing trend extends from the late Mississippian through 83 \nthe Pennsylvanian (Strauss & Peters-Kottig 2003, their fig. 3; Peters-Kottig et al. 2006, 84 \ntheir fig. 1). A similar trend was noted through part of this period in the Throckley and 85 \nRowlands Gill boreholes in northern England by Stephenson et al. (2008). 86 \nHere new brachiopod \u03b418Ocarb and \u03b413Ccarb data from well-dated Serpukhovian horizons in 87 \nthe northern England borehole at Woodland are combined with Serpukhovian to 88 \n 5\nBashkirian \u03b413Corg data from nearby Throckley and Rowlands Gill boreholes, to track 89 \nfarfield isotopic changes in the context of known glacial activity in the southern 90 \nhemisphere and particularly in eastern Australia. 91 \nGeological setting 92 \nThe Namurian (Serpukhovian \u2013 early Bashkirian) rocks of northeast England consist of 93 \ncycles of mixed clastic \u2013 carbonate facies, known locally as Yoredale cyclothems 94 \n(Johnson 1984) or Yoredale cycles (Tucker et al. 2009). The Yoredale facies was 95 \ndeposited over an area of 10000 km2 in northern England and southern Scotland and is 96 \nparticularly well developed on fault blocks such as the Alston Block, on which the 97 \nWoodland (NZ 09096 27694) and Rowlands Gill (NZ 1664 5815) boreholes are situated 98 \n(Fig. 2). The Throckley Borehole (NZ 14557 67617) is situated north of the Rowlands 99 \nGill borehole in the Northumberland Trough.  100 \nYoredale cyclothems vary in thickness from around 5 to 50 m (Tucker et al. 2009) and 101 \nconsist of a lower carbonate part up to 30 m thick, overlain by a clastic section, 102 \nsometimes capped by a coal seam or seatrock. The carbonate units vary from bioclastic 103 \nlime mudstone to grainstone, but most are wackestone-packstone. These limestones are 104 \nbelieved to have been deposited in the outer shoreface transition to the offshore 105 \nenvironment in depths of 5 to 30 m. The clastic units are broadly deltaic, with 106 \nshallowing-upward and coarsening-upward trends (mudstone to sandstone), occasionally 107 \nincised into cycles below. Locally shoreline or marine sandbar facies also occur (Tucker 108 \net al. 2009). 109 \n 6\nIn the Woodland Borehole, brachiopods were recovered in abundance from limestones 110 \n(Faraday House Shell-Bed, Crag Limestone, and Rookhope Shell-Beds Limestone), and 111 \nmudstones, particularly between the Crag Limestone and Rookhope Shell-Beds 112 \nLimestone (Fig. 3). Samples for \u03b413Corg were taken from mudstones and limestones in 113 \nmainly transgressive parts of cyclothems in the Throckley and Rowlands Gill boreholes 114 \n(Fig. 4). 115 \nStratigraphically significant fossils occur in the sections and allow the brachiopod-116 \nbearing horizons and the horizons from which samples for \u03b413Corg were taken to be 117 \nprecisely dated to the regional Carboniferous substages of Western Europe (Heckel & 118 \nClayton 2006) and in some cases to the standard global stages. 119 \nAge of the sections 120 \nWoodland Borehole brachiopod horizons 121 \nRich foraminiferal assemblages were recorded from the lower part of the Woodland 122 \nBorehole, from the Four Fathom and Great limestones (Figs. 1, 4, 5), including Euxinita 123 \npendleiensis, Globivalvulina parva, Eostaffella pseudostruvei, E. angusta, E. acutiformis, 124 \nE. postmosquensis, E. chomatifera, E. bashkirica, Monotaxinoides priscus, M. subplana, 125 \nM. subconica, Endothyranella and Archaediscus at \u201ctenuis\u201d stage. This assemblage is 126 \ntypical of the Serpukhovian, although some of the taxa may first occur in the latest 127 \nBrigantian (C\u00f3zar & Somerville, 2004; C\u00f3zar et al., 2008). The Faraday House Shell-Bed 128 \ncontains few foraminiferans and most are not stratigraphically significant apart from rare 129 \nArchaediscus at \u201ctenuis\u201d stage suggesting a Pendleian age. Amongst rare 130 \nstratigraphically-significant macrofauna in the Woodland Borehole, Mills & Hull (1968) 131 \n 7\nalso recorded the Tylonautilus nodiferus \u2018early mutation\u2019 of Stubblefield at 347.53 m 132 \n(just below the Faraday House Shell-Bed), indicating the upper part of the Pendleian 133 \nStage (Figs. 1, 4). The Rookhope Shell-Beds Limestone contains rich foraminiferal 134 \nassemblages, most of which persist from older Pendleian horizons; however, first 135 \noccurrences include Eostaffellina protvae, E. paraprotvae, Plectostaffella varvariensis, P. 136 \njahkensis and Eosigmoilina robertsoni. Eostaffellina protvae and E. paraprotvae have 137 \nonly been recorded from the Protvinskian (Figs. 1, 4) in the Moscow Basin and lateral 138 \nequivalents in the Urals Mountains and Donetsk, and are generally used as markers of the 139 \nlate Serpukhovian (e.g. Aisenverg et al. 1979, 1983; Einor 1996; Gibshman 2001; 140 \nVdovenko, 2001). Plectostaffella and Eosigmoilina are also considered late Serpukhovian 141 \nmarkers in the Donetsk (Aisenverg et al. 1983; Vdovenko 2001) and Europe (Conil et al. 142 \n1991). In England and Scotland, Eosigmoilina is regarded as Arnsbergian by Fewtrell et 143 \nal. (1981) and Riley (1992). The Grindstone Limestone (Fig. 4) contains the first 144 \noccurrence of Seminovella, considered by Conil et al. (1980, 1991) as a Chokierian 145 \nmarker, but in Russia commonly described from the Zapaltubinsky horizon (late 146 \nArnsbergian). The Whitehouse Limestone contains Plectostaffella bogdanovskensis, 147 \ntypically recorded from the base of the Bashkirian of the Urals Mountains (Reitlinger in 148 \nEinor et al. 1979). 149 \nThe Woodland borehole was also studied for palynology by Neves (1968). The section 150 \nbetween the Crag Limestone and Lower Fell Top Limestone (Fig. 4) contains Bellispores 151 \nnitidus, Crassispora kosankei, Grandispora spinosa, Remysporites magnificus, 152 \nTripartites trilinguis and T. vetustus. According to Owens et al. (2004) B. nitidus, G. 153 \nspinosa, Remysporites magnificus and T. vetustus range into the upper Arnsbergian 154 \n 8\nwithin the TK Biozone but not into the SV Biozone. This section also lacks Rotaspora 155 \nfracta, Verrucosisporites morulatus, Raistrickia nigra and Reticulatisporites carnosus 156 \nwhich disappear at the top of the preceding Vm Biozone. The distribution of taxa thus 157 \nsuggests that the section between the Crag Limestone and Lower Fell Top Limestone is 158 \nArnsbergian but not latest Arnsbergian in age (Owens et al. 2004), in broad agreement 159 \nwith the age suggested by foraminifera. 160 \nSample horizons for \u03b413Corg in Throckley and Rowlands Gill boreholes  161 \nRiley (1992) recorded a diverse foraminiferal fauna from the Lower Fell Top Limestone 162 \nof the Rowlands Gill borehole, including Eosigmoilina robertsoni which he considered to 163 \nbe Arnsbergian. Similarly Riley considered the Upper Fell Top Limestone (Fig. 4) to be 164 \nArnsbergian in age. The lowest studied part of the Throckley Borehole between 358.33 165 \nand 243.23 m was assigned by Stephenson et al. (2008) to the latest Brigantian to 166 \nPendleian palynological capistratus \u2013 nitidus (CN) Biozone of Owens et al. (2004), 167 \nthough the top of the biozone was poorly defined because the base of the succeeding 168 \nBiozone, the trigallerus \u2013 knoxi (TK) Biozone, cannot be positioned precisely. However 169 \nages from the Woodland Borehole can be adopted since the major limestones (e.g. the 170 \nWhitehouse and Upper Fell Top limestones) can be correlated with confidence between 171 \nthe two boreholes. 172 \nPerhaps the most distinct palynostratigraphical level in the Throckley Borehole is marked 173 \nby the late Alportian first appearance of common Crassispora kosankei at 126.5 m (KV 174 \nBiozone, see Owens et al. 2004). The first occurrence of Lycospora subtriquetra, slightly 175 \nlower, at 136 m, suggests that the subtriquetra \u2013 ornatus (SO) Biozone may extend from 176 \n136 to 126.5 m (late Arnsbergian to early Alportian; Owens et al. 2004). 177 \n 9\nAge conclusion 178 \nDating shows that the age of the brachiopod section studied for \u03b413Ccarb and \u03b418Ocarb 179 \nbetween the shales beneath the Crag Limestone and the Rookhope Shell-Beds Limestone 180 \nis late Pendleian to early Arnsbergian (Protvinskian), and therefore would fall within the 181 \ninterglacial period between C1 and C2 of Fielding et al. (2008a; Fig 1). 182 \nThe range of ages of the \u03b413Corg horizons in the Throckley Borehole is from the late 183 \nBrigantian - Pendleian CN Biozone to the late Alportian-early Marsdenian KV Biozone, 184 \nwhile the range in age of the \u03b413Corg horizons in the Rowlands Gill Borehole by 185 \ncorrelation with the Throckley section is late Brigantian - Pendleian to approximately 186 \nArnsbergian. Thus, the \u03b413Corg record in the Throckley Borehole encompasses much of 187 \nthe Serpukhovian and into the Bashkirian, while that in Rowlands Gill Borehole covers 188 \nthe lower and middle parts of the Serpukhovian (Fig. 1). 189 \nMaterials and methods 190 \nThe Woodland Borehole brachiopod specimens were rigorously screened by 191 \nultrastructural, cathodoluminescence and trace element geochemical analysis. Forty 192 \nspecimens were first selected for ultrastructural and cathodoluminescence analysis. Of 193 \nthese 36 underwent subsequent isotope analyses, and 19 also provided enough carbonate 194 \nfor additional trace element geochemical analysis (Table 1). 195 \nThe selected brachiopods are Antiquatonia hindi, A. costata, Skelidorygma sp., 196 \nAnthracospirifer sp., Angiospirifer sp., A. trigonalis, and Merospirifer sp. Antiquatonia 197 \nhindi and A. costata are concavo-convex semi-infaunal productids which are found in 198 \nmudstone and shale. Skelidorygma sp., Anthracospirifer sp., Angiospirifer sp., A. 199 \n 10\ntrigonalis, and Merospirifer sp. are pediculate spiriferids which usually occur in 200 \nlimestone. Semi-infaunal productids supported themselves with spines in soft substrates 201 \nin low energy environments generally on offshore platforms, at depth below the fair-202 \nweather wave base (Brunton 1972, 1984, 1987). Pediculate taxa, particularly those with 203 \nlarge pedicle openings, indicate attachment to hard substrates in relatively high energy 204 \nenvironments, where the settling strategies require firm attachment to the substrate 205 \n(Brunton, 1987). They suggest firm substrates, higher energy, and depth around the fair-206 \nweather wave base. The Woodland brachiopods thus comprise a mixture of shallow and 207 \ndeeper water taxa, from a range of palaeoenvironmental conditions in different parts of 208 \ntypical Yoredale cycles (Fig. 3). 209 \nThe specimens were embedded in resin, cut along longitudinal and transverse sections, 210 \nthen etched with 5% HCl for 20 s and metallic-coated before being investigated using 211 \nSEM to check the preservation of their shell fabric. In addition thin sections were made to 212 \nallow cathodoluminescence microscopy of the same sections. 213 \nCathodoluminescence (CL) was performed using a cold cathode luminoscope (Nuclide 214 \nELM2) operating at 10KV voltage with a current beam of 5-7 MA. This is a screening 215 \ntechnique widely used to assess preservation of brachiopod shells (Popp et al. 1986; 216 \nGrossman et al. 1993), as they commonly show no luminescence in absence of significant 217 \ngeochemical alteration. However, its reliability to distinguish altered from unaltered 218 \nshells has been questioned (Korte et al. 2005, England et al. 2006). To overcome one of 219 \nthe drawbacks of conventional optical CL (i.e. the fact that beam current conditions vary 220 \nin the different studies) we analysed all the thin sections of the brachiopod shells with the 221 \nsame instrument operating under the same beam conditions. 222 \n 11\nThe brachiopods were sampled for geochemical and isotope analysis by drilling 6-8 223 \nmilligrams along the longitudinal section of each shell using a diamond drill bit. Only the 224 \ndiagenetically-unaltered inner part of the thick secondary and tertiary shell layer of both 225 \nthe ventral and dorsal valves was sampled for geochemical and isotope analyses (Table 226 \n1). Features such as the muscle attachment areas, articulation points, interareas and 227 \nlophophore support were avoided, although Parkinson et al. (2005) showed there is a 228 \nminimal risk when sampling specialised shell fragments. 229 \nSubsamples for geochemical analysis were dissolved in ultra-pure acetic acid. The acetic 230 \nacid leached fraction reserved for geochemistry (see below) was evaporated to dryness 231 \nand the residue taken up in 1% nitric acid. Geochemical data were obtained by 232 \nInductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) on a Fison\/ARL 233 \n3580 simultaneous\/sequential spectrometer with Gilson auto sampler. 234 \nApproximately 30-100 microgrammes of carbonate were used for isotope analysis using a 235 \nGV IsoPrime mass spectrometer plus Multiprep device. Isotope values (\u03b413C, \u03b418O) are 236 \nreported as per mille (\u2030) deviations of the isotopic ratios (13C\/12C, 18O\/16O) calculated to 237 \nthe VPDB scale using a within-run laboratory standard calibrated against NBS standards. 238 \nAnalytical reproducibility of the standard calcite (KCM) is < 0.1\u2030 for  \u03b413C and \u03b418O.  239 \nAll samples for organic carbon isotope analysis were treated to remove any migrated 240 \nhydrocarbons since these affect \u03b413Corg bulk values, particularly if they are markedly 241 \ndifferent in geochemical origin from the in situ material analysed (Stephenson et al. 242 \n2005). The hydrocarbons were removed by using a soxhlet apparatus on crushed samples 243 \n(Stephenson et al. 2005). In order to determine the \u03b413C values of different fractions of 244 \norganic material, separate analyses were done on hydrocarbon-free rock samples and on 245 \n 12\nmicroscopic fossil wood fragments from the same rock samples. To obtain microscopic 246 \nfossil wood fragments, each sample was acid macerated in hydrofluoric acid, and the 247 \norganic residue rinsed and sieved into two different size fractions. The fraction 500-1000 248 \n\u00b5m size was exclusively of terrestrial vascular plant origin, dominated by dark brown or 249 \nblack structured woody phytoclasts, and this was analysed to determine \u03b413C of wood 250 \nfragments. %C was measured using a Carlo Erba 1500 elemental analyser, calibrated 251 \nagainst an Acetanilide standard in order to estimate the amount of material for isotope 252 \nanalysis. Replicate analysis of well-mixed samples indicated a precision of + <0.1%. 253 \n13C\/12C analyses were performed also using the Carlo Erba 1500 on-line to a VG 254 \nTripleTrap (plus secondary cryogenic trap in the mass spectrometer for these very low 255 \ncarbon content samples) and Optima dual-inlet mass spectrometer, with \u03b413C values 256 \ncalculated to the VPDB scale using a within-run laboratory standard (BROC1) calibrated 257 \nagainst NBS-18 and NBS-19. Replicate analysis of well-mixed samples indicated a 258 \nprecision of + <0.1\u2030 (1 SD).  259 \n 260 \nResults and discussion 261 \nShell structure  262 \nAll the brachiopod sections were analysed under SEM (see the ultrastructure summary in 263 \nTable 1). Most of the valves have a well-preserved shell succession consisting of a 264 \nsecondary layer of fibres or laminae and a prismatic tertiary layer.  265 \nThe secondary layer of the spiriferids (Anthracospirifer sp., Angiospirifer sp., 266 \nAngiospirifer trigonalis) consists of long fibres with a keel and saddle profile in cross 267 \n 13\nsection (Fig. 6 a-c). Internally, the secondary layer makes transition to a very thick 268 \nprismatic tertiary layer by lateral spreading of the terminal face of each fibre and then by 269 \nvertical accretion to form discrete prisms; they show interlocking boundaries normal to 270 \nthe surface of accretion and strong growth banding (Fig. 6 d-j). Some specimens show 271 \nevidence of diagenetic alteration under SEM, the fibres of the secondary layer being 272 \nrecrystallized and amalgamated corresponding to type-3 (Fig. 6 k) and type-6 (Figs. l, 6) 273 \naltered ultrastructures of Samtleben et al. (2001). However, generally the tertiary layer 274 \nstill shows growth banding and no sign of diagenetic alteration.  275 \nFew productid shells are well-preserved, with a laminar secondary layer of lath-like 276 \nlaminae alternating with a prismatic layer (BU6768 Antiquatonia hindi) (Fig. 6 m-n). 277 \nMost productids show altered amalgamated laminae corresponding to type-9 278 \nultrastructure (Antiquatonia costata; Fig. 6 o) of Samtleben et al. (2001). 279 \nCathodoluminescence  280 \nThe second and tertiary layers of all the analysed spiriferids were non-luminescent (NL) 281 \nunder CL, in agreement with their preserved ultrastructure and TE. Non-luminescent 282 \nspiriferid shells are typically dull black in colour under CL, and they contrast with the 283 \norange luminescence of the bulk rock, which records several diagenetic events. Two 284 \nspecimens (BU8285, BU8292; Fig. 7) show luminescent dog-tooth cement encrusting 285 \ntheir inner shell surface; in the associated bulk rock several brachiopod shells are 286 \nencrusted by these cements on both sides (thin isopachous layer) suggesting shallow 287 \nburial cementation or an early dissolution around bioclasts before cementation.  288 \n 14\nProductids are either NL or may show a slight luminescence parallel to the lath-like 289 \nlaminae which form their secondary layer. The sources of cathodoluminescence in 290 \nbiogenic carbonate are Mn++ and Fe++ , which tend to be more concentrated in those shells 291 \nwhich have an increased amount of intercrystalline organic material in the original in vivo 292 \nlaminar fabric (Barbin et al. 1991; Griesshaber et al. 2007). The laminar fabric of 293 \nproductids has a higher organic content (proteinaceous membranes) than the fibrous and 294 \nprismatic layers of spiriferids and tends to show a greater luminescence (Angiolini et al. 295 \n2008, 2009).  296 \n 297 \nTrace elements 298 \nWell-preserved modern brachiopods from a variety of depositional environments display 299 \nSr contents of 450-1930 ppm (\u00b5m\/g), Mn from 1-199 ppm (\u00b5m\/g), and Fe contents 300 \ngenerally <140 ppm (\u00b5m\/g), although much higher values have also been reported (Brand 301 \net al. 2003). Similar trace-element concentrations have been reported for Carboniferous 302 \nand Permian brachiopods, although Sr contents as high as 3400 ppm and Mn of 250 ppm 303 \nhave also been measured in NL brachiopod shells (Popp et al. 1986). Korte et al. (2003) 304 \nadopted the criteria of <250 ppm Mn and >400 ppm Sr for samples to be classified as 305 \nwell-preserved. Bruckschen et al. (1999) accepted a more conservative cut-off limit of 306 \n200 ppm for Mn, which they considered to be a more reliable indicator of diagenetic 307 \nalteration than Sr content. Van Geldern et al. (2006) classified shells with <100 ppm Mn 308 \nand >500 ppm Sr as well preserved. 309 \nJoachimski et al. (2005) showed that Silurian (1211-1830 ppm) and Devonian (758-1467 310 \nppm) brachiopods have higher Sr concentration than those of the Late Carboniferous and 311 \nEarly Permian. High Sr concentration in biological calcite before the Late Carboniferous 312 \n 15\nwas related by Steuber & Veizer (2003) to the Ordovician-Mississippian calcite episode, 313 \nwhen strontium-rich biogenic calcite was formed from high Sr\/Ca oceanic waters. 314 \nWoodland brachiopods were analyzed for TE where possible, but in some cases too little 315 \ncarbonate was available after isotope analysis (Table 1). The brachiopods have Mn 316 \ncontents <210 ppm (and 80% have Mn < 100 ppm) and Sr contents >500 ppm, which 317 \nindicates good preservation, based on most criteria described above. The analyses of the 318 \nbulk rock (Table 1) associated with two brachiopod specimens show much higher (> 319 \n2000 ppm) Mn contents. Fe is more variable in the brachiopods (106 - 4072 ppm), but 320 \n70% of the specimens have Fe < 1500 ppm; the higher values are suggested to result from 321 \nsurface coatings of oxyhydroxides and come from brachiopods that were enclosed by 322 \ndark mudstone that probably contains pyrite. We do not consider variable Fe to be an 323 \nindicator of preservation, due to its insolubility under oxic conditions (Popp et al. 1986; 324 \nMcArthur et al. 2000). 325 \nBrachiopod isotope composition 326 \nBrachiopods are central to carbon and oxygen isotope study because their shells are 327 \nconsidered to be usually well preserved, thus containing an ocean water composition 328 \nfrom the time of formation (Parkinson & Cusack in Williams et al. 2007; Grossman et al. 329 \n2008), and because rhynchonelliform brachiopod shells have a dense microstructure and 330 \ngenerally low Mg chemistry that make them resistant to diagenesis (Compston 1960; 331 \nPopp et al. 1986). In Carboniferous farfield studies, brachiopod specimens from the U.S. 332 \nMidcontinent and Russian Platform have mainly been used up to now, because of their 333 \ngood preservation and wide geographic and temporal distribution. Samples from the U.S. 334 \nMidcontinent come from Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, 335 \n 16\nIllinois, Idaho and Indiana (Grossman et al. 1991, 1993, 2008; Mii et al. 1999; Batt et al. 336 \n2007). Russian Platform samples are from the Moscow Basin and the Ural Mountains 337 \n(Bruckschen et al. 1999, 2001; Mii et al. 2001; Grossman et al. 2002; Korte et al. 2005). 338 \nIn most cases these were broad surveys using a large number of analyses to indicate 339 \ntrends. In some cases, specimens were not identified other than as brachiopods, with 340 \nmany being small fragments, thus effects of generic or specific variation cannot be ruled 341 \nout. 342 \nIn the US Midcontinent and Russia, the later (Bashkirian) part of Glacial II of Isbell et al. 343 \n(2003) is well represented by samples. High \u03b418O and \u03b413C values (~\u20131 to \u20132\u2030 and +4 to 344 \n5\u2030 respectively) are consistent with glaciation. However, the early part (Serpukhovian) 345 \nis poorly represented. In the Moscow Basin there is a hiatus in the late Serpukhovian, and 346 \nin the early Serpukhovian in the Donetsk Basin from where most Russian samples come 347 \n(Bruckschen et al. 1999), there are very few sample points. Late Serpukhovian samples 348 \nfrom the Askyn section in the Urals Mountains yield \u03b418O values averaging \u22124.8\u2030. 349 \nBruckschen et al. (2001) suspected that these Serpukhovian samples might be influenced 350 \nby freshwater influx during deposition, and Grossman et al. (2008) suspected diagenetic 351 \ninfluence. There are similarly few horizons for sampling in the early Serpukhovian in the 352 \nUS Midcontinent (Grossman et al. 2008); Bishop et al. (2009) recorded brachiopod \u03b418O 353 \nvalues of approximately \u22123\u2030 in two horizons in the lowermost Indian Springs 354 \nFormation. Middle and late Serpukhovian values average around \u22125\u2030 (Batt et al. 2007) 355 \nand latest Serpukhovian \u03b418O values are ~ \u20133\u2030 (Grossman et al. 2008; Brand & 356 \nBrenckle 2001). 357 \n 17\n\u03b418O values from pristine Woodland Borehole brachiopods vary between \u20133.4 and \u2013358 \n6.3\u2030, whereas \u03b413C vary between \u20132.0 and +3.2\u2030. The carbon isotope data lie within 359 \nthe range that is generally thought to represent Carboniferous seawater values (Grossman 360 \net al. 2008). The brachiopods comprise a mixture of shallow and deeper-water taxa, 361 \nranging in depth from below fair-weather wave base to a few metres and thus are unlikely 362 \nto introduce bias due to temperature difference causing differences in \u03b418Ocarb (see 363 \nImmenhauser et al., 2003). Rhynchonelliform brachiopods are also known for low 364 \ntolerance of variable salinity. Thus, it is likely that the Woodland brachiopods are 365 \nrepresentative of unrestricted ocean conditions. 366 \nThe low \u03b418O values from pristine Woodland Borehole brachiopods are very close to 367 \nthose recorded in the Late Devonian by Van Geldern et al. (2006), who showed a long 368 \nterm \u03b418O decreasing trend, from a value of +2.8\u2030 in the Early Devonian to values 369 \nbetween \u20134.3 and \u20136.1\u2030 in the latest Givetian and Late Devonian. Van Geldern et al. 370 \n(2006) interpreted this secular decrease in \u03b418O as due to a combination of climate 371 \nwarming and a moderate decrease in \u03b418O of seawater (down to \u20132.4\u2030 V-SMOW). 372 \nUsing the expression of Leng & Marshall (2004), from the equation of Kim & O\u2019Neil 373 \n(1997): 374 \nt = 13.8 \u2013 4.58(c \u2013 w) + 0.08(c \u2013 w)2 375 \nit is possible to obtain a maximum value for the \u03b418O seawater (w) in the Serpukhovian, 376 \nassuming a palaeo-seawater temperature (t) and using the Woodland brachiopod calcite 377 \naverage value (c). Assuming a seawater temperature (t) of 29\u00b0C (i.e. the modern tropical 378 \nsea-surface temperature; Cahyarini et al. 2008) for the tropical setting of the Woodland 379 \nBorehole brachiopods and using the average value obtained for the brachiopod calcite (c= 380 \n 18\n\u20135.0\u2030), the \u03b418O seawater (w) would have been approximately \u20131.8\u2030 VSMOW. This 381 \nvalue is consistent with the small range in \u03b418O through the Palaeozoic indicated by the 382 \n\u2018clumped isotope\u2019 palaeothermometer (see Came et al., 2007; \u03b418O values of 383 \n\u22121.2\u00b10.5\u2030VSMOWfor the Early Silurian and \u22121.6\u00b10.1\u2030 VSMOW for the Middle 384 \nPennsylvanian). 385 \nOne of the requirements for negative \u03b418O seawater values is the absence of widespread 386 \nice-caps. Also, according to Van Geldern et al. (2006), continental weathering is an 387 \nimportant sink for 18O and may lower \u03b418O seawater because the products of continental 388 \nsilicate weathering (clay minerals and other H2O-bearing minerals) are enriched in 18O, 389 \nthough this is considered a minor effect. Dilution by meteoric water may also lower \u03b418O 390 \nseawater (Van Geldern et al. 2006), but the presence of brachiopods in the Woodland 391 \nsection which are intolerant of low salinity, indicate that this was not a factor. Therefore 392 \nthe low \u03b418O seawater suggested by Woodland Borehole brachiopods is most likely the 393 \nresult of the absence of widespread ice-caps during the late Pendleian to early 394 \nArnsbergian, in the interglacial interval between C1 and C2 (Fielding et al. 2008a).  395 \n 396 \nOrganic carbon isotopes 397 \nA long term statistically significant trend in the Throckley and Rowlands Gill boreholes, 398 \nis increasing \u03b413C org (c. \u201324\u2030 to c. \u201322\u2030 in Throckley Borehole; Fig. 4; for details see 399 \nStephenson et al. 2008). In the Throckley Borehole the trend extends from within the 400 \nPendleian to the Chokierian (Fig. 1). This increasing trend is also mirrored in the lower 401 \nparts of the boreholes by \u03b413C from organic carbon separated from limestone (Fig. 4). The 402 \n 19\ntrend was considered by Stephenson et al. (2008) to record global variation because (1) it 403 \noccurs in both boreholes; (2) the data come from a random collection of mainly wood 404 \nfragments; (3) wood fragments alone show the same trend (Fig 4); and (4) marine and 405 \nterrestrial \u03b413Corg show the same trends (for detailed discussion see Stephenson et al. 406 \n2008). Stephenson et al. (2008) did not attempt to explain the pattern of \u03b413Corg; however 407 \nthis is now possible in the context of recent information. 408 \nWetland lycophyte-dominated palaeotropical forests (\u2018coal forests\u2019) became widespread 409 \nin the Serpukhovian in central Asia and spread over the European Variscan foreland and 410 \nintramontane basins through the Serpukhovian, Bashkirian and Moscovian, declining in 411 \nthe Kasimovian (Cleal & Thomas 2005). Lycophyte-dominated forests were an extremely 412 \nefficient carbon sink because of their high growth rates and because of low rates of 413 \ndecomposition of vegetation litter due to low-pH substrates and low fungal activity, 414 \nburying 108 to 390 tonnes of carbon per hectare per annum. At their maximum 415 \ndevelopment in the late Moscovian, the lycophyte forest had a global area of 2395 x 103 416 \nkm2 which sequestered 93 x 109 tonnes of carbon per annum (Cleal & Thomas 2005). 417 \nDuring photosynthesis, 12C is taken up preferentially to 13C such that organic matter 418 \nderived from organisms is about 20\u2030 lower in 13C than the carbon in atmospheric CO2 or 419 \ndissolved inorganic carbon in seawater (Berner 2003). The process of burial of organic 420 \nmaterial in rock therefore causes an increase in atmospheric \u03b413C which is transferred to 421 \nplant tissue. This is the likely cause of the increase in \u03b413Corg in the Throckley and 422 \nRowlands Gill boreholes, and it would also suggest a steady decrease in pCO2 which is 423 \nalso indicated by coarse modelling through the whole of the Carboniferous \u2013 Permian 424 \n(Berner 2003) and by coarse sampling in the late Palaeozoic (Peters-Kottig et al. 2006). 425 \n 20\nWoodland Borehole carbonate \u03b413Ccarb (Fig. 4) does not occur over a long enough 426 \nstratigraphic range to discern a trend, but other studies of whole rock carbonate (e.g. 427 \nBuggisch et al. 2007) and brachiopod calcite (compilation by Frank et al. 2008) through 428 \nthe late Serpukhovian into the Bashkirian show increasing trends interpreted as due to 429 \ncarbon burial in terrestrial or marine environments. 430 \nConclusions 431 \nStable isotope composition of brachiopod carbonate in the Woodland Borehole indicates 432 \nseawater isotope composition during the middle part of the Serpukhovian that in turn 433 \nsuggests ice-free conditions. This corresponds to the period between C1 and C2 of 434 \nFielding et al. (2008a) and indicates that glaciation cannot have been widespread for a 435 \nsubstantial part of the Serpukhovian. \u03b413Corg data from the nearby Throckley and 436 \nRowlands Gill boreholes indicate a steady fall in pCO2 throughout the Serpukhovian and 437 \ninto the Bashkirian which is consistent with carbonate \u03b413C trends as well as with the 438 \nworldwide rise of lycophyte-dominated coal forest.  439 \nFrank et al. (2008) commented on the discrepancy between low brachiopod \u03b418O and 440 \ndistribution of glacial facies in the Serpukhovian as suggested by Isbell et al. (2003), and 441 \non the absence of a clear isotopic signature related to the onset of Glacial II. Thus they 442 \nsuggested that Serpukhovian glaciation was geographically limited and that falling \u03c1CO2 443 \nand other factors may have lowered temperatures sufficiently by the Bashkirian to allow 444 \nthe growth of continental glaciation which produced a consistent \u03b418O response. Evidence 445 \nfrom rigorously-screened well dated brachiopods in the Woodland Borehole, and from 446 \n 21\ndated \u03b413Corg horizons in Throckley and Rowlands Gill boreholes show this interpretation 447 \nto be largely correct and shows the value of targeted studies of farfield sections. 448 \nIt is interesting to compare the onset of Cenozoic Antarctic glaciation with this process. 449 \nAt about 34 Ma (earliest Oligocene), causes of cooling included ocean heat transport 450 \nchanges due to palaeogeographic changes, but declining \u03c1CO2 was the dominant cause of 451 \ncooling and glaciation (Deconto & Pollard 2003). Early Cenozoic \u03c1CO2 was 2 to 5 times 452 \ngreater than present day levels, declining to reach modern levels in the early Neogene 453 \n(Pearson & Palmer 2000). Deconto & Pollard (2003) showed that as \u03c1CO2 declined 454 \ncausing a reverse greenhouse effect, the East Antarctic Ice Sheet enlarged from small 455 \nisolated ice caps into permanent ice caps. At \u03c1CO2 levels of 3x and 2x present levels, 456 \nheight mass balance feedbacks were initiated during orbital periods producing cold 457 \naustral summers, in turn producing much larger terrestrial ice sheets. According to 458 \nDeconto & Pollard (2003), within a single 40ka obliquity cycle, ice sheets reached sea 459 \nlevel around most of the continental margin of Antarctica. Although the cause of \u03c1CO2 460 \ndecrease was different in the Cenozoic (likely reductions in outgassing from volcanoes) 461 \nbecause Cenozoic forests were not as efficient carbon sinks as lycophyte-dominated coal 462 \nforest, it is likely that a similar mechanism of increased glacial nucleation with a 463 \nbackground of decreasing \u03c1CO2 caused the Bashkirian onset of large-scale glaciation. 464 \nIn summary, the Woodland, Throckley and Rowlands Gill sections show that at least one 465 \nsubstantial period between the C1 and C2 glaciations in eastern Australia cannot have 466 \nexperienced cold temperature or large-scale glaciation. This casts doubt on the 467 \nproposition that Glacial II of Isbell et al. (2003) began substantially in the Serpukhovian 468 \nand supports the model developed from compilations by Fielding et al. (2008b) that the 469 \n 22\nSerpukhovian saw only isolated ice centres, whereas the start of the Bashkirian saw a 470 \nmuch greater broadening of ice. The sections also show that a steady fall in \u03c1CO2 471 \noccurred throughout the Serpukhovian and into the Bashkirian. These events were likely 472 \nrelated to a slow increase in glaciation from small nuclei in upland areas in the early 473 \nSerpukhovian to continental glaciation in the Bashkirian. 474 \n 475 \n 476 \nJoanne Green and Chris Kendrick are thanked for the stable isotope analysis.
