However, for many users of assistive technologies, \nthis remains a problematic scenario.

There is an urgent need to research the implications of this exclusion for human \nservice educators and practitioners \nKEYWORDS accessibility, digital exclusion, disability, empowerment, social exclusion \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe Internet is a pervasive digital environment; one which can affect all aspects of daily life. Digitally \nconnected citizens can shop online, organize finances, access education, news, media and socialize \nwith family, friends and colleagues, all via an Internet connection. Opinions are divided on whether \nthese virtual developments constitute a digital revolution or merely represent evolving technical \nprogress (Webster, 2006). What is less contentious is the speed with which digital lifestyle changes \nhave occurred. Rapid media transformations can have immense implications, not least for those \n\u2018\u2018excluded from the new digital technologies which form the backbone of the modern knowledge \neconomy\u2019\u2019 (Department of Culture, Media and Sport, 2008, p. 12). One group at risk of digital \nexclusion are users of assistive technologies. These alternative technologies are designed to support \ndigital independence for individuals with physical, sensory and cognitive impairments. However, \nassistive technology has specific requirements and without attention to these, this group is at risk of \nfalling through the digital net, being denied access to opportunities for communication as well as \nparticipation in the increasing online provision of government information and services. \nThis article originates from the authors\u2019 research interests into digital equity for disabled people. \nMany of whom use assistive technology to access the Internet, in particular those with visual \nimpairment who use text-to-speech software to listen to content which sighted people see on their \ncomputer monitor. Barriers to textual communication for blind and partially sighted people have a \nlong history with analogue roots. These stretch back to the time of the Gutenberg Press and the \nmass distribution of printed content in Europe. In comparison to printed text, digital data is \ninherently flexible which gives it the unique advantage of being customizable to individual \npreference. As well as increasing the size of content, and changing colors and contrasts, this \nflexibility includes the conversion from text into speech output. However, achieving this potential \ndiversity of access requires content creators to design digital data in ways which support alternative \ninput and output. Without sufficient knowledge about this additional requirement, access can be \ndenied. This lack of awareness can also cause confusion between the provision of access and the \ngreater issues around the quality of that access. As the value of digital participation is recognized, in \nparticular by governments who see it as a way of cutting costs and improving efficiency, provision of \ndigital technology can be seen as a \u2018\u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019\u2019 solution to issues of digital divides. The \nbroader requirements, ensuring digital content is accessible to a range of alternative technologies, \nappear to be less widely recognized or valued. This can result in users of assistive technology being \ndenied access to online services which other users of digital environments take for granted. \nIn an increasingly digital society, the failure to ensure disabled users of assistive technology have \nequitable digital experiences, places them at a disadvantage in terms of access to online information \nand services. For those already marginalized and facing barriers to social participation, the result \nmay be further disempowerment. The authors of this article suggest that issues of digital exclusion \nneed to be addressed in the policies and practices of a range of subject disciplines relating to human \nservices. This article will summarize some key issues around exclusion from digital media and how \nthis may relate to existing barrier models of disability. This will be followed by an overview of a \nselection of digital inclusion strategies in particular those which support links with existing categories \nof social exclusion. Finally, the article will address the potential implications of digital exclusion for \nhuman service educators and practitioners in the 21st century. \nDIGITAL DISCRIMINATION \nDigital technology offers multiple opportunities for personal communication and access to \ninformation. It is increasingly being used by central and local governments for delivering public \ninformation and services. In the 21st century, it is likely there will be continual growth in the use of \ncomputers, mobile phones, and other digital devices for participation in social, cultural, and \neconomic practices. This digital dependency raises questions around ensuring equity of access. The \n\u2018\u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019\u2019 model of digital devices favored by production economies sits poorly with \nindividual choice; in particular when that choice is influenced by impairment. Historically, sections of \nsociety being excluded from dominant means of communication, is not a new phenomenon. In the \nlate 15th century, the production of text in a single fixed print format heralded a move from aural to \nvisual communication. This favored those with hearing impairment and excluded access for those \nwith vision impairment. Eisenstein (1980) has described the Gutenberg printing press as a powerful \nchange agent, making possible not only mass production of the Bible, the key text of the time, but \nalso the distribution of dominant ideology and the means of spreading political subversion and social \nchange. The decentralization of knowledge, and freer circulation of information, had immense \npolitical and religious significance in western society, leading indirectly to movements such as the \nRenaissance and Reformation (Eisenstein, 1980). In the late 20th century similar parallels have been \nmade with the Internet. This has also been called a \u2018\u2018disruptive technology,\u2019\u2019 one which has \nescalated an information revolution (Webster, 2006), and contains within itself the power to effect \nchange (Anderson & Elloumi, 2004). However, the technology in itself cannot be seen as neutral; \ninstead it reflects the social conditions in which it is developed. McLuhan (1962) suggested prevailing \nmodes of technological communication, both analogue and digital, determine the ways in which \nmessages are received and the ratio of this influence increases in proportion with use. An example \nof this can be seen in relation to communication. In the early days of the Internet, in the late 20th \ncentury, the culture and institution of the Post Office held a dominant role in the social structure and \nelectronic mail remained less common than writing letters. Within a relatively short space of time, e-\nmail had become the communication method of choice favored by both state and industry. One \ncognitive effect of this on individual behavior was the expectation of increased speed in message \nexchange. This became measured in minutes or hours rather than days. Mobile digital technologies \nhave further increased the expectations of connection speeds with an effect of reducing barriers \nbetween work and leisure time. As McLuhan predicted, these changes in media can be seen to have \nimpacted on social structures and influenced individual behavior expectations with regard to the \nways in which individuals communicate. \nIt is comparable to what happens when a new note is added to a melody ... when the sense ratios \nalter in any culture then what had appeared lucid before may suddenly become opaque, and what \nhad been vague or opaque will become translucent. (McLuhan, 1962, p. 41) \nProblems arise when massive changes in dominant delivery modes exclude certain groups. Examples \nof cultural exclusions include early oral \u2018\u2018storytelling\u2019\u2019 cultures which disadvantaged those with \nhearing impairment, and the \u2018\u2018manuscript-to-print\u2019\u2019 culture which shifted the barriers of access to \npeople with impaired vision. Digital data has the potential to challenge such historical barriers. The \ndevelopment of assistive technologies which supports alternative formats, have the benefit of \nincreasing opportunities for media participation, in particular for disabled people already facing \nbarriers to communication,. However, as this article will suggest, barriers to access remain and, as \nlinks are being made between existing categories of social exclusion and new digital exclusions, \nopportunities for digital participation for disabled people using assistive technologies appear \nrestricted. Before investigating this further, it will be useful to revisit a existing barriers model \nrelating to disablement. \nMODELS OF DISABILITY \nThe history of disability discrimination has been traced to the industrialization of society and the \nmedicalization of individual difference through physical and cognitive impairment. This led to a \npervasive \u2018\u2018Medical Model\u2019\u2019 of disability, one which encouraged the view that personal impairment \nlay at the root of barriers to social and cultural participation (Oliver, 1997). Political activism in the \nUK in the late 20th century, increased awareness of the social origin of barriers to participation. \nBarriers, it was suggested, were created by society\u2019s failure to recognize and adapt to the diversity of \nits citizens. A \u2018\u2018Social Model\u2019\u2019 of disability was called for; one which supported legislation to provide \nalternative modes of access, not only to public buildings and transport, but to wider opportunities \nfor participation in all aspects of social and cultural life. The mandate of \u2018\u2018inclusive\u2019\u2019 design was \nadopted whereby \u2018\u2018improvements for some\u2019\u2019 were promoted as \u2018\u2018improvements for all.\u2019\u2019 Recognizing \nand removing external barriers to access offered real potential for widening participation to the built \nenvironment. A similar policy which focuses on the removal of barriers can now be usefully applied \nto digital landscapes. In the early 21st century, there are multiple challenges to the provision of \nequitable digital access. Rather than digital data fulfilling its potential to be inclusive, access is being \nrestricted through a combination of obstacles such as the cost of assistive technology, the need for \nspecialist support, and the exclusive way in which digital data is designed, especially when this fails \nto take into account the individual nature of assistive software. As a result many disabled people, in \nparticular those with sensory impairment, are being denied equitable digital access through a lack of \nadaptation to their needs. The authors of this article suggest this constitutes a social model of \n\u2018\u2018digital\u2019\u2019 disability whereby barriers are being put in place by an external environment, one which \nfails to acknowledge and cater for a sufficiently diverse range of access requirements. \nDIGITAL DIVISIONS \nThe potential of digital data to be fully accessible, regardless of physical, sensory, or cognitive \nimpairment, is limited by assumptions about dominant modes of computer use. In particular, the \ndesigners and producers of digital data assume a \u2018\u2018MEE-Model\u2019\u2019 of consumption, one where access is \nassumed via the use of Mouse, Eyes and Ears (Watling, 2010). Recent developments in touch-screen \ntechnology are moving away from design for mouse controls but touch screen use still retains \nassumptions of physical and sensory competency. Assistive technology offers powerful alternatives \nto dominant delivery modes with the potential to effectively narrow existing digital divides. It offers \na diversity of input and output methods, designed to suit individual preference, and encourages and \nsupports nonstandard use. Digital data is equally adaptable. Text can be converted to speech and \nspeech converted to text. Text can be increased in size, its color and contrast customized to suit \nindividual need, and audio and video content offered in alternative formats such as transcripts, \ncaptions, or subtitles. This flexibility ensures that where the appropriate technology, training, and \nsupport is in place, individuals previously denied access to digital media have the potential for \nequitable digital experiences which enables independence and empowerment rather than \ndisablement through digital exclusion. \nAccess barriers for users of assistive technologies have complex dynamics (Steyaert, 2005). Assistive \nhardware and software are expensive which can make them unaffordable where they could benefit \nthe most. To use assistive technologies effectively requires appropriate training and ongoing \nsupport; this can be specialist, expensive and not easily available. However, the most significant \nbarrier to digital access remains the exclusive design of digital data. Even with all the prerequisites \nfor access in place, if the content is provided in a single, fixed format which prevents individual \ncustomization or has not been designed with the needs of a range of assistive technologies in mind, \nthen digital access for the users of those technologies will continue to be denied. \nDiscrimination legislation acknowledges the need to ensure equity of access to information and \nservices (Disability Discrimination Act [DDA], 2005), and international accessibility guidance from the \nWeb Accessibility Initiative (WAI, 1999=2008) contains recommendations and principles which \nsupport accessible design. However, application and compliance to statutes and standards remains \nlimited. The findings of the most comprehensive review to date of public websites in the UK showed \nthe majority failed to conform to basic levels of accessibility (Disability Rights Commission [DRC], \n2004). Specialist organizations which address digital exclusion issues often do so within specific \nremits such as TechDis (http:\/\/www.techdis.ac.uk) which operates within the UK education sector. \nRegistered charities which focus on access to digital technologies often have limited funds; this can \nresult in access to their policies and practices on digital inclusion being primarily Internet based and \naccess restricted by their digital nature. With regard to the human services, research into the \nincreasing use of digital technologies has addressed potential implications for changes in working \npractices but offered less experience from the user perspective, although the work underpinning the \nshift from a medical to a social model of disability predates contemporary moves towards the \nincreasing governance of welfare (Finkelstein, 2001; Oliver, 1997). Revised editions (Finkelstein, \n2007; Oliver, 2009) also exclude topics such as computers, the Internet or alternative ways of digital \ninteraction. \nDigital divisions for users of assistive technologies remain largely obscured by the scarcity of public \nknowledge and literature. Academic research on disability has been subject to funding restrictions, \nand academia\u2019s own arcane systems, leading to one UK academic commenting that the more highly \nrated work is considered within the research assessment frameworks, then the higher the chances it \nwill be relatively inaccessible to the general public, and at best access to findings will be restricted by \nlocation or licence (Barnes, 1996). As a result, the majority of contemporary narratives of digital \nexclusion remain primarily anecdotal and informed by personal knowledge and experience. This is \nthe case relating to the authors of this article who regularly witness the digital exclusion of service \nusers and it is these experiences which led to the impetus for their ongoing research. \nINTERNATIONAL APPROACHES TO BRIDGING DIGITAL DIVIDES \nThe implications of the digital divide are not limited to whether or not individuals have or do not \nhave access to technology. As the information society unfolds, having access and being able to use \nthe new technology, especially the Internet, also means being an integral part of society and being \neffective citizens. People with limited access will be outpaced by those who are ahead in the ability \nto select and process information. (Wong, Fung, Law, Lam, & Lee, 2009, p. 755) \nThere is increasing international evidence of more governments promoting initiatives to increase \nadoption of digital services and including strategies to reach the digitally excluded. The Four Little \nDragons of East Asia; Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan, have become, along with \nEurope and North America, central players in the highly developed, modern industrial world (Vogel, \n1993). With a primary focus on knowledge economies, they have recognized digital divisions among \ntheir populations and proposed strategies to bridge these divides. Commonality of exclusion is \nevident across these four countries; digitally excluded categories include older people, single \nparents, female homemakers, children in low-income families, new immigrants, and persons with \ndisabilities and=or chronic illnesses (Wong et al., 2009). In South Korea, Broadband IT Korea Vision \n2007 has overseen the countrywide provision of broadband network and fibre-optic cable access. \nThis ran alongside an information-literacy program, Dynamic IT Korea, which included the provision \nand set up of home computers. The Intelligent Nation 2014 in Singapore has specifically targeted \ndigitally excluded people including senior citizens and persons with disabilities; these groups have \nbeen offered a combination of free and refurbished computers with a year\u2019s free broadband access. \nThe International Development Authority (IDA) offered students from low-income households free \ncomputers in exchange for community service. They have also worked with the Society for the \nPhysically Disabled and local training and education institutions to provide specific targeted training. \nTaiwan\u2019s U-Taiwan Program has offered a range of digital support for its socially excluded citizens \nand those living in geographically remote locations. A partnership with the Graduate School of Social \nInformatics has seen the formation of local \u2018\u2018community universities\u2019\u2019 and the government\u2019s Science \n& Technology Advisory Group has funded Digital Opportunity Centers and Tribal Outreach Computer \nCenters alongside public access internet connections. In Hong Kong, the Digital 21 Strategy was \nintroduced in 1998 and updated in 2001, 2004, and 2008. Their vision \u2018\u2018is an ultimate information \nsociety, under which everyone can create, access, utilize and share information and knowledge, \nthereby empowering individuals and enterprises to achieve their full potential and improve their \nquality of life\u2019\u2019 (Office of the Government Chief Information Officer [OGCIO], 2007, p. 7). There have \nbeen a number of individual projects under the Digital 21 Strategy aimed at narrowing digital \ndivides. The Digital Bridge Project offered computers to secondary school children without access to \na home computer. The Digital Solidarity Fund combined both commercial, government, and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) to provide a joined up approach to digital exclusion issues and \na computer-recycling initiative was set up to refurbish and redistribute computers to excluded \ngroups. In 2007, the Labour and Welfare Bureau set up a rehabilitation program, \u2018\u2018Information \nCommunication Technology (ICT) plans for persons with disabilities\u2019\u2019 which focused specifically on \nthe need for the research and development of assistive technology. Digital exclusion strategies such \nas these in East Asia show that in the push to incorporate digital lifestyles there is clear recognition \nthat digital exclusion has a high occurrence in specific, already socially excluded, groups. However, \nthe primary focus to date has remained on the provision of access rather than addressing its quality \nand accessibility. \nUK APPROACHES TO BRIDGING DIGITAL DIVIDES \nIn the UK, the Delivering Digital Inclusion Action Plan (DCMS, 2008) linked existing social exclusion \nwith the potential for digital exclusion. The plan clearly states that \u2018\u2018 ... the dividing lines of social \nequality are closely aligned to those associated with digital exclusion; age, geography, educational \nattainment, income, motivation and skills, disability, ethnic minority\u2019\u2019 (DCMS, 2008, p. 12). The same \nreport highlights the disadvantages of being digital disconnected: \u2018\u2018There is growing evidence that \ndigital technology can greatly enhance both quality of services and quality of life\u2014particularly for \nthe most disadvantaged citizens and communities\u2019\u2019 (DCMS, 2008, p. 8). The Digital Britain Report \n(DCMS, 2009) and National Plan for Digital Participation (Business, Innovation and Skills, 2010) \nidentified six priority groups similar to those identified in the East Asia strategies; namely older \npeople, low-income households, low-income families, unemployed people, people with no formal \nqualifications and disabled people (BIS, 2010). A new UK government (elected May 2010) continued \nto demonstrate plans for driving digital participation and to stress the benefits of being online. The \ngovernment\u2019s Race Online 2012 website (http:\/\/raceonline2012.org\/) affirms that UK citizens will all \nbe \u2018\u2018better off when everyone\u2019s online\u2019\u2019. The government\u2019s digital manifesto sets out plans for a \n\u2018\u2018truly networked nation\u2019\u2019 where digitally disconnected citizens \u2018\u2018will be even more isolated and \ndisadvantaged as government and industry expand ever faster into digital-only services\u2019\u2019 (Central \nOffice of Information [COI], 2012, p. 3). Digital delivery of services is promoted as a means to cut \npublic spending and to \u2018\u2018do more for less\u2019\u2019 while offering increased consumer savings, improved \naccess to information and education, and facilitating and reinforcing social networks. Specific cost-\ncutting targets include welfare and social-care budgets, for example, reducing the cost of residential \nprovision \u2018\u2018The annual cost of residential care for over 65\u2019s is \u00a34.8 bn a year so there is a huge prize \nto be won even if we save a fraction of these costs by using technology to reduce isolation or \nprevent the need for residential care\u2019\u2019 (approximately 1.6 billion US dollars) (COI, 2012, p. 33). \nHowever, there is little attention paid to the users of assistive technologies in this vision of a digital \nwelfare state. Digital divides are related to specific social and economic causes rather than broader \nissues around the accessibility of resources: \u2018\u2018Over a decade of research into the barriers to use of \nthe internet has reached the same findings, namely, that lack of motivation, access and skills are the \nkey reasons why people don\u2019t get online\u2019\u2019 (COI, 2012, p. 38). Government plans to build a \n\u2018\u2018networked nation\u2019\u2019 where everyone has access to the \u2018\u2018transformative power\u2019\u2019 of the Internet \ncontain little indication of how citizens dependent on assistive technology will operate within its \nvision of a digital future. Instead, new measures to provide incentives for excluded adults who have \nnever been online are specifically aimed at low-income families, unemployed adults and older \npeople; there is no mention of support for users of assistive technologies (BIS, 2010, p. 15). This \nappears to ignore specific barriers of cost and specialist training and support as well as lack of web \naccessibility. \u2018\u2018It is vital that the Government responds to the needs of disabled people [failure to do \nso] ... will, we believe, leave a huge potential gap in provision and mean that measures to make \nDigital Britain accessible to all run the risk of excluding disabled people\u2019\u2019 (Consumer Expert Group \n[CEG], 2009, p. 35). \nIMPLICATIONS OF DIGITAL EXCLUSION FOR HUMAN SERVICES \nAlthough links between social exclusion and the potential for digital exclusion have been made \nexplicit, government policy continues to support increased use of the Internet for the provision of \ninformation and management of welfare. In an increasingly digital landscape, digital exclusion has \nthe potential to be a major barrier to social participation. As human service educators, the authors \nof this article are concerned about the location of responsibility for supporting those members of \nsociety, already marginalized and disempowered, to effectively operate in digital environments. \nWong et al. (2009, p. 764) makes a single mention of social workers who \u2018\u2018 ... can help organize and \nmobilize leaders and users among the disadvantaged at the community level.\u2019\u2019 In the UK, current \npolicy and practice appears to fail to recognize access barriers such as cost, training, and exclusive \ndigital data, faced by users of assistive technology. For example, the UK Social Work Task Force \nreport into the future of social work recognizes how good quality ICT can support effective \nprofessional practice, and that social workers need support in demonstrating their digital confidence \nand competency. However, it makes no mention of the potential implications of increasing digital \npractices on the service user or who will address issues arising from digital exclusion (Department \nfor Children, Schools and Families, 2009). Within social work education, the UK Quality Assurance \nAgency has revised subject benchmarks to require the social work student to demonstrate ability to \n\u2018\u2018... have a critical understanding of the social impact of ICT, including an awareness of the impact of \nthe \u2018\u2018digital divide\u2019\u2019 (Quality Assurance Agency, 2008, p. 14). However, the criteria for demonstration \nand assessment is left to individual institutions; a practice with potential for regional inconsistencies \nof knowledge and understanding. There is an apparent lack of awareness of the potential \nimplications of digital exclusion which raises concern. Addressing social inequity and \ndisempowerment is fundamental to human services and it is possible that the significance of digital \ninequity may not yet be fully realized. This article suggests that users of assistive technology, many \nof whom already face multiple social barriers, are being needlessly excluded from digital landscapes. \nThe technology supports diversity of access, yet barriers of cost and inadequate support \ncompounded by exclusive digital design means that from Gutenberg to Google, disabled people \ncontinue to have their access denied. This article suggests that in the absence of technical reasons \nfor this exclusion, barriers to digital participation must be social in origin. The concern is that to be \ndigitally excluded in the 21st century may lead to new forms of social exclusion in ways which have \nnot yet been fully understood. The concerns highlighted in this article suggest further research is \nrequired into the politics of digital discrimination and the potential implications of digital exclusion \nfor human service educators and practitioners. \nCONCLUSION \nA range of digital communication services, and digital gateways to information and services, are \nincreasingly influencing modes of social participation. Of particular concern to human service \npractitioners should be the move towards online delivery of information and provision of welfare \nlest this excludes those users of assistive technologies who may already be experiencing multiple \nbarriers to participation. The value base of professional practice in human services encompasses a \n\u2018\u2018global concern for the achievement of greater equality in the allocation of social goods between \nnations, communities and individuals\u2019\u2019 (Banks, 2008, p. 34). Connections between social exclusion \nand the potential for digital exclusion suggest the human services, in particular social work with its \nfundamental value of empowerment, may increasingly be under pressure to address digital barriers. \nHowever, supporting service users in gaining access to appropriate technologies is only the first step. \nDigital participation can never be assumed. Greater awareness is called for with regard to \nsubsequent barriers which derive from the failure of digital data to be designed in ways which \nsupport diversity of access. Ensuring this requires a multidisciplinary approach which lies beyond the \nscope of this article. However, awareness of the relevant issues can help educators and practitioners \nto challenge any inadvertent replication of exclusive practice. As reliance on the Internet continues \nto be the rule rather than the exception, the failure to support those at risk of digital exclusion could \nrisk caring professions being seen as reinforcing rather than alleviating social injustice. \nREFERENCES \nAnderson, T., & Elloumi, F.
