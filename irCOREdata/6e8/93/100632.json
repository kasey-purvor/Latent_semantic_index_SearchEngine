Although study of\nthese neutron-rich nuclei is challenging, it is important that\nit be done because it may bring us fundamental knowledge\nof the nature of nuclear forces, as well as of properties of\nnuclear matter in extreme conditions such as neutron stars.\nRecently, 10He and 5H were newly added to the nuclear\nchart [2,3] in the extremely neutron-rich section (the ratio\nof the neutron and proton numbers is N\/Z = 4 for these\nnuclei). 10He attracts particular interest because it is supposed\nto be a doubly closed-shell nucleus with the magic numbers\nZ = 2 and N = 8, and we might expect that the nucleus has a\nbound state. However, it was found that the nucleus has only\na resonant state with the 8He+n+n [2] structure. Therefore,\nand because 8He has a relatively large two-neutron separation\nenergy (S2n = 2.13 MeV [4]), the magic number N = 8 is\nlikely shifted to N = 6 in the neutron drip line and beyond. It\nis therefore interesting to systematically investigate the change\nin the shell structure for He-isotopes as the number of neutrons\napproaches N = 8 from N = 2.\nIt is widely accepted that 6He is a typical case of a nuclear\nBorromean halo structure. The nucleus has been studied\nwell theoretically by using the 4He+n+n model. Various\ncalculations based on this model were performed by many\ngroups, and they could successfully explain the appearance\nof the halo structure [5\u20139]. The next level of study was a\nquantitative description of the halo structure, in particular,\nto precisely reproduce the binding energy by using reliable\ninteractions for the subsystems (4He+n, n+n). However, with\nsuch interactions and the above-mentioned 4He+n+n models,\nthe resultant binding energy of 6He is accurate only up to\n200\u2013300 keV. To account for the discrepancy, Cso\u00b4to\u00b4 suggested\nan influence of the t+t component mixing in the ground\nstate of 6He, considering a possibility that the two valence\nneutrons can slightly distort the strongly bound \u03b1 clustering\nconfiguration [10,11]. In his model, the distortion effect was\ntaken into account through a coupled-channel model including\nthe (4He+n+n) and (t+t) structures. Surprisingly, the correct\nbinding energy was successfully obtained through this model.\nSuch a mixing of the unexpected cluster (or distorted) com-\nponent in the core part could be a key point in understanding the\nanomalous neutron orbits in light neutron-rich nuclei. There\nare some physical systems for which such a consideration\nhas already been given. 10Li is observed to be an unbound\nsystem with respect to its breakup into 9Li+n. To explain\nthe observed physical quantities of this nucleus, it is believed\nthat the valence neutron needs to occupy an s state, but the\nemergence of this unexpectedly low-lying s-state orbit cannot\nbe explained through a simple shell model picture [12]. The\nappearance of such low-lying s states has been discussed also\nfor the Be isotopes. A possible mechanism to bring down\nthe s orbit is suggested in terms of the \u03b1+\u03b1 clustering (or\ndeformation) effect. This clustering effect is, nonetheless, not\nyet examined well in other isotopes. It is therefore interesting\nto extend the investigation to other systems. Systematic study\nof the competition between the shell structure and the cluster\nstructure in light nuclear systems is worthwhile. In association\nwith rearranging the single-particle levels, we may also be able\nto explain, through the investigation of the clustering effect, the\ndisappearance of the N = 8 shell gap in light nuclei, which has\nbeen partly explained by the pairing blocking effect [13,14].\nThus, the aim of this paper is to study the t+t clustering\neffect in He isotopes, as the first step in the systematic study.\nWe attempt to show how additional neutrons can break the\nsimple \u03b1-core structure to allow the t+t clustering component\nin the simplest systems.\nThe recent development of numerical techniques with large\ncomputational power enables us to calculate few-body systems\nwith more than three bodies [15\u201318]. Even with such methods,\nhowever, it is not easy, or almost impossible, to investigate the\nmultichannel coupled systems beyond the three-body problem,\nsuch as (4He+n+n)+(t+t). In order to unify the pictures\nof the shell and cluster models, antisymmetrized molecular\ndynamics (AMD) was applied [19]. The method is proven\nto be useful in qualitative descriptions of both cluster and\nshell-model type of structures, in a single framework. Note,\nhowever, that the single AMD wave function, which represents\neach nucleon as a Gaussian wave packet, is not sufficient for\nquantitative descriptions of the mixed states of the cluster\n0556-2813\/2006\/74(1)\/017307(4) 017307-1 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 74, 017307 (2006)\nand shell-model structures. Moreover, the single AMD wave\nfunction cannot describe the halo structure of neutrons with a\nlong tail, which is particularly important in the He isotopes.\nSuperposition of the AMD wave functions is therefore required\nfor a more elaborate description of light nuclear systems\n[19,20].\nRecently, we proposed an extended AMD approach [21,22]\nthat combines the AMD with the generator coordinate method\n(GCM) [20,23]. In this method, generation of the GCM basis\nfunction is implemented in the procedure of the stochastic vari-\national method (SVM) [15,24]. We named this new approach\n\u201cAMD triple-S (superposition of selected snapshots)\u201d. It is\ndemonstrated that coupled-channel cluster problems can be\neasily solved with our approach, even for seven-body systems\nsuch as 10He (4He+6n and t+t+4n). In this paper, we apply\nthe AMD triple-S to the investigation of the t+t clustering\neffect in the He isotopes.\nLet us briefly describe our framework. (For details, see\nour previous publications [21,22].) The AMD wave function\nis expressed as a fully antisymmetrized Slater determinant\nconsisting of single-particle wave functions of the Gaussian\nform [19]\n\u0002 = 1\u221a\nA!\ndet[\u03c8i(j )\u03c7i(j )], (1)\n\u03c8i(j ) \u221d exp\n[\u2212 \u03bd(\u0003rj \u2212 \u0003zi\/\n\u221a\n\u03bd)2 + \u0003z 2i \/2\n]\n, (2)\nwhere \u03c7i represents spinors for spin and isospin. Here, \u0003zi is a\ncomplex variational parameter, whose real and imaginary parts\nrepresent the expectation values of the position and momentum\nof a single particle, respectively. The oscillator parameter (b =\n1\/\n\u221a\n2\u03bd = 1.46 fm) is common for all nucleons so as to remove\nexactly the center-of-mass kinetic energy. In this framework,\nthe nucleons forming a cluster (either an \u03b1 or a triton) share the\nsame value of \u0003zi . The values of \u0003zi are randomly generated, and\nonly the imaginary part of \u0003zi is optimized so as to adequately\nhandle the spin-orbit interaction. This optimization is carried\nout through the frictional cooling method proposed in the\nstandard AMD framework [25]. During this cooling process,\nthe parity of the Slater determinant is projected out. With these\nAMD wave functions, a nonorthogonal basis is prepared for\nthe GCM calculation [23]. The GCM ansatz in our framework\nis therefore expressed as a superposition of the basis functions\n(\u0002(\u00b1)k ), in the following manner:\n\u0006\nJ (\u00b1)\nMK =\n\u2211\nk\nckP\nJ\nMK\u0002\n(\u00b1)\nk . (3)\nProjection is executed onto a good angular-momentum state\nby the operator P JMK . Coefficients ck correspond to the\nvariational parameters to be determined by diagonalization\nof the Hamiltonian matrix after the projection. To reduce\nthe dimension of the diagonalization, the basis selection is\nperformed for the GCM basis in the procedure of SVM [15];\nthat is, only the configurations making a sufficiently large\nenergy gain are employed from the randomly produced GCM\nbasis. The Volkov No. 2 potential [26] is used for the central-\nforce part of the N -N interaction, and the G3RS potential [27]\nis employed for the spin-orbit part with V0 = 2000 MeV.\n-35\n-30\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0  50  100  150  200  250  300  350  400\nEn\ner\ngy\n (M\neV\n)\nNumber of generated basis functions\nFIG. 1. Example of energy convergence of the ground 0+ state of\n8He in the GCM diagonalization. Dotted line shows the energy of the\n4He+n+n+n+n threshold.\nThis choice of interactions is the same as in our previous\nstudies [21,22].\nIn Fig. 1, an example of energy convergence is presented\nfor the case of the ground state of 8He, with the parameters of\nVolkov No. 2 set to be M = 0.6 and B = H = 0. The same\nvalue of \u0003zi is chosen for the four nucleons forming the \u03b1\ncore. The present model is therefore a simple five-body model\nwith the configuration of 4He+4n. In the figure, energy is\nplotted on the vertical axis, while the number of generated\nbasis functions is on the horizontal axis. The dotted line shows\nthe energy of the 4He+4n threshold.\nThe dimension for diagonalization is increased until con-\nvergence is obtained. Each basis function is generated with\nthe assistance of a stochastic variational algorithm. The real\npart of \u0003zi is randomly given, whereas the imaginary part\nis determined through the frictional cooling method in the\nAMD framework. Such a basis function is applied to the\ndiagonalization only when the resultant energy eigenvalues are\nlowered by the order of 10 keV. It is clearly seen in Fig. 1 that\nthe ground state converges to \u221231.8 MeV with this method.\nThe convergence is checked with several different random\nsequences, and it is confirmed that the same results are obtained\nto within several tens of keV. Binding energies calculated\nthrough our method are compared with resonating group\nmethod (RGM) calculations, in which the same interaction is\nused. For the \u03b1+\u03b1+\u03b1 and 4He+n+n systems, AMD triple-S,\nrespectively, produces E = \u221289.62 [21] and \u221228.63 MeV,\nwhile RGM gives E = \u221289.62 [28] and \u221228.34 MeV [29].\n(In the calculation of the latter system, our model space is\nslightly larger than the RGM model space.) Therefore, the\npresent method is reasonably good in comparison with other\nsophisticated few-body calculations.\nIn Fig. 2, the systematics of the binding energies is shown\nfor the He isotopes. The Volkov No. 2 potential (M = 0.6) is\nused with two different sets of B and H parameters, that is,\nB = H = 0.125 and B = H = 0. As seen from the figure, the\nsecond case (B = H = 0) gives rise to a better agreement\nwith the experimental binding energies of 7He and 8He,\nalthough the first set (B = H = 0.125) has been known to\nreproduce the binding energies of 5He and 6He reasonably\nwell. It is also known that the first set can describe the unbound\n017307-2\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 74, 017307 (2006)\n-34\n-32\n-30\n-28\n-26\n-24\n-22\n-20\nHe He He He He He He4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nE\nn\ner\ngy\n (\nM\neV\n)\nB=H=0.125\nB=H=0\nExp.\nFIG. 2.

It turns out, however, that the\nparameters B = H = 0.125 make the interaction too repulsive\nwhen many-neutron systems are considered, particularly for\n9He and 10He. Thus, it is difficult to consistently reproduce\nthe trend of the binding energies for the He isotopes with\nthe fixed parameters. This may be due to the limitation\nof the simple interaction we have employed. Another reason\nis that we calculated the binding energies with a bound-state\napproximation in this study, so that the calculated energies\nwith the present method are expected to be slightly higher\nthan the resonant energies calculated with the proper boundary\ncondition. For these reasons, we hereafter use the parameters of\nB = H = 0 because this set reproduces the experimental total\nbinding energies better, especially for 7He, 8He, 9He, and 10He.\nOur primary goal is to explain how the t+t clustering compo-\nnent contributes to the binding energy in neutron-rich isotopes\nheavier than 6He. In this view, the interaction set of B = H =\n0 seems to be adequate for our purpose. Further fine tuning of\nthe interaction is therefore not attempted in this study.\nIn Fig. 3, the effect of the t+t clustering component is\nshown for the binding energies of He isotopes. The solid line\nindicates the binding energies calculated with the coupled-\n-33\n-32\n-31\n-30\n-29\n-28\n-27\n-26\nE\nne\nrg\ny \n(M\neV\n)\nHe He He He He He He4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nFIG. 3. Calculated binding energies of the He isotopes for\nthe single-channel case and the coupled-channel case. Solid line\ncorresponds to the coupled-channel model, in which the model\nspace of {t+t+valence neutrons} is coupled to the model space\nof {4He+valence neutrons}. The dashed line corresponds to the\n{4He+valence neutrons} model.\nchannel model, in which the {t+t+valence neutrons} channel\nis coupled to the {4He+valence neutrons} channel. On the\nother hand, the dashed line represents the binding energies\ncalculated with the single {4He+valence neutrons} channel.\nTherefore, the difference between the two lines comes from\nthe {t+t+valence neutrons} components, which implies that\nthe \u03b1 core is distorted. It is clearly seen that the binding\nenergies are properly lowered by this distortion effect not only\nfor 6He, which was originally pointed out by Cso\u00b4to\u00b4 [10] and\nArai et al. [11], but also for the other He isotopes. In the figure,\nthe energy gain \u0007E due to the distortion effect is 0.35 MeV\nfor 6He. After the renormalization effect for the 4He+n\nsubsystem [10] is considered, \u0007E reduces to 0.26 MeV. Our\nmodel is thus able to explain the missing part of the binding\nenergy, which is of the order of 200\u2013300 keV, with the coupled-\nchannel approach. Many other models based on the 4He+n+n\nstructure could not explain this. As for 8He, the energy gain\u0007E\nis 0.64 MeV, which implies the two extra neutrons from 6He\nenhance the t+t clustering effect. As for 10He, the presence of\nmany valence neutrons (six neutrons) may enhance further the\nt+t clustering effect on the basis of the previous discussions\n(i.e., on 6He and 8He), but at the same time the p-shell of\nneutrons is completely filled in this nucleus. This means that\nthe core of the nucleus may favor the spherical shape; that\nis, the distortion of the \u03b1 core may be strongly suppressed\nbecause of the shell effect. As seen from Fig. 3, the energy gain\nis calculated to be \u0007E = 0.42 MeV in the present study. This\nresult suggests that the distortion effect is still present though\nit seems that the shell closure effect stops the increasing trend\nof the energy gain \u0007E at 10He. It should be noted, however,\nthat the numerical error coming from the convergence criterion\nmay be of an order of 10 keV.\nIn summary, by means of the AMD triple-S, we have\nsystematically studied effect of the t+t clustering on the\nbinding energies of He isotopes. The t+t clustering component\nis qualitatively demonstrated to be important, although the\nbinding energies are not reproduced to a good accuracy,\nespecially for the isotopes beyond the neutron drip line\n(N = 7, 8). It seems that this discrepancy is simply due to\nour choice of the two-body interaction. It should be noted\nthat the current study is the first application of the newly\ndeveloped method, so in order to test the method, our\ncalculations were executed with the simple N -N interaction.\nFrom this viewpoint, the resultant calculations are satisfactory,\nbut further development is certainly necessary. To improve the\nquality of the calculations, more realistic interactions should be\nused such as a full treatment of the tensor-force contribution,\nwhich is taken into account only through a renormalization\nof the central and spin-orbit parts of the interaction in the\ncurrent framework. The use of more realistic interactions could\nbe one of the key points to overcoming the difficulty we\nhave encountered in the present study. The implementation\nof more elaborate interactions in the cluster model is now in\nprogress [30].\nWe thank Professor R. C. Johnson for his advice and careful\nreading of our manuscript.
