The role of the vector correlator, in\nthe annihilation of an electron-positron pair into hadrons, has been much studied. Here\nwe focus on the scalar channel, which is even more intriguing. There are at least 6 potent\nreasons for studying scalar correlators.\n1. Quark masses: Consider the scalar divergence, i(ma\u2212mb)\u03c8a\u03c8b, of a flavour-changing\nvector current. In perturbative QCD, its correlator is known exactly [3] to two-loop\norder, where it involves trilogarithms of two variables: m2a\/Q\n2 and m2b\/Q\n2, at euclidean\nmomentum Q2. At 3 loops, it is was possible to obtain the first two [4, 5, 6, 7] terms of\nthe expansion in 1\/Q2; at 4 loops, only the imaginary part is known, and then only to\nleading order in 1\/Q2. The coefficients of quark and gluon condensates are known, to lesser\naccuracy [8]. Combining this information with experimental data on K\u22170 mesons, coupling\nto the scalar form factor of semi-leptonic Kl3 decay, and with further theoretical input\nfrom chiral perturbation theory, the scale-dependent strange-quark mass of the modified\nminimal subtraction (MS) scheme has been determined [9] at a scale of \u00b5 = 1 GeV, from\nwhence it may be evolved to higher scales, using the anomalous quark-mass dimension\n\u03b3m(\u03b1s) = d logm(\u00b5\n2)\/d log(\u00b52).\n2. Higgs decay: At the opposite extreme of very high energy, 4-loop perturbative anal-\nysis of the scalar channel yields radiative corrections [1] to the decay of the Higgs boson\nof the standard model into quark-antiquark pairs, with a coupling to each flavour pro-\nportional to the mass of the quark (the 3-loop corrections are known from the results of\nRefs.[5, 6, 7, 10])).\n3. Renormalization group: As is clear from these two important phenomenological\ninvestigations, mass renormalization is of the essence in the scalar channel. In the vector\nchannel, we may ignore quark-mass effects at high energy; in the scalar channel they\nabide, since the only form of scalar current that has meaning is \u03c8aMa,b\u03c8b, where M is\na mass matrix. Hence the vertex renormalization of the scalar current \u03c8a\u03c8b is precisely\nthe inverse of mass renormalization. It follows that the anomalous quark-mass dimension\n\u03b3m(\u03b1s) is ever present in the renormalization-group equations for correlators of scalar\ncurrents, while in the vector case it is inactive at very high energy, provided the order\nO(m2\/Q2) corrections are neglected.\nThanks to the dedicated labour and great ingenuity of colleagues, we have been pro-\nvided with the 4-loop anomalous quark-mass dimension [11, 12] and the 4-loop beta func-\ntion [13] of QCD. In our scalar analysis, these are inextricably intertwined.\n4. Renormalons: It is thus of great interest to try to extend our understanding of\nperturbative quantum field theory by studying the interplay of coupling-constant and mass\nrenormalization. In this respect, we noticed an apparent omission, concerning behaviour\nat higher orders in the scalar channel. Let Nf be the number of quark flavours and \u03b1s(\u00b5\n2)\nbe the strong coupling at scale \u00b52. In the limit Nf \u2192 \u221e, with b = Nf\u03b1s\/6\u03c0 held fixed,\n1\nthe vector correlator is known [14] to all orders in b, at order 1\/Nf . At first sight, this\nlimit appears remote from asymptotically free QCD, where the beta function is dominated\nby gluons. However, it has become common practice to transform large-Nf results to so-\ncalled large-\u03b20 results, where \u03b20 \u2261 (11Nc\u2212 2Nf)\/12, with Nc = 3 colours and Nf = 3, 4, 5\nactive flavours, gives the one-loop term in the QCD beta function\n\u03b2(\u03b1s) \u2261\nd log\u03b1s\nd log \u00b52\n= \u2212\n\u2211\nn\u22650\n\u03b2n\n(\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)n+1\n. (1)\nBy the simplistic device Nf \u2192 Nf \u2212\n33\n2\n, called naive nonabelianization (NNA) in [15],\none transforms the irrelevant large-Nf ultraviolet (UV) factorial perturbative growth of\nan abelian theory, like QED, into the highly pertinent large-\u03b20 asymptotic perturbative\ngrowth of QCD series, since \u2212b is then replaced by b = \u03b20\u03b1s(\u00b5\n2)\/\u03c0 \u2248 1\/ log(\u00b52\/\u039b2). Then\nthe so-called renormalon structure (i.e. the perturbative factorial growth) of the vector\nresult [14] is related to the way that long-distance physics is absorbed into condensates in\nthe operator-product expansion (OPE) of the vector correlator of QCD (for the studies in\nQCD see e.g. [16, 17, 18] and [19, 20] for the reviews).\nThe virtue of an all-orders large-Nf result is to provide a smooth map from the full\ntwo-loop result, which it exactly reproduces, to the large-order behaviour, which it re-\nproduces at leading order in O(1\/Nf). It was therefore natural to inquire whether the\nvector analysis [14] had yet been extended to the scalar case. We did not find such a\nwork. Undertaking the task ourselves, we came to understand why it is so much more\ndifficult in the scalar channel: the ultraviolet (UV) infinities of mass renormalization must\nbe included to all orders in the coupling. In Sec. 2, we achieve this, after taking guidance\nfrom the study of critical phenomena.\n5. Multiloop estimates: Effort has been expended in estimating effects in electron-\npositron annihilation, \u03c4 -decay and in deep-inelastic scattering characteristics beyond the\norders of perturbation theory that are exactly computed (for different approaches see\nRefs.[21, 22, 20]). A similar attempt was made in the case of the decay width of the\nHiggs boson [23] following the ideas of Ref.[21] and by the authors of Ref.[24] using the\nasymptotic Pade\u00b4-approximant method of Ref.[25]. This can only be inspired guesswork,\ninformed by past experience and hopeful intuition. To study in detail the ideas and\napproximations, lying beyond such guesswork, one must test them in detail in as many\nprocesses as possible. In Sec. 3 we submit a variety of suggestions to detailed scrutiny in\nthe scalar channel, by taking account of existing 4-loop input from [1, 11, 12, 13] and by\nexploiting our new all-orders results at large-Nf . Special attention is paid to the results of\napplication of the NNA procedure, closely connected to the large-Nf expansion. We also\ninvestigate the structure of the 3- and 4-loop coefficients we are interested in within the\n\u201cdual NNA\u201d procedure, which is exact in the large number of colours Nc limit.\n6. Analytical continuation: Direct multiloop calculations are usually performed in\nthe euclidean space-like region. However, for the scalar correlator the quantities of phe-\nnomenological interest, namely the spectral functions of the QCD sum rules (see e.g.\nRefs.[26, 27, 28]) and the decay width of the Higgs boson are proportional to its imagi-\nnary part, defined in the minkowskian time-like region. In higher orders the coefficients of\nperturbative expansions contain \u03c02-contributions, which generally speaking, are not small\n2\nand can affect the asymptotic structure of the perturbative series in powers of \u03b1s\/\u03c0. These\neffects have been much studied (see e.g. Refs.[29]-[40],[4]) in attempts to resum them in\nall-orders of perturbation theory. In Sec. 3, using the results of Sec. 2, we develop further\nthis approach to the case of fractional powers of \u03b1s, which appear in the relation between\nthe MS-scheme running quark mass m(\u00b52) and the scheme-invariant mass m\u02c6, introduced\nin Refs.[41, 42] (recent analogous independent considerations were given in Ref.[43]). The\nNNA approximation and the Borel resummation technique will be essential theoretical\ncornerstones of our analysis.\nIn the Conclusions we discuss the theoretical uncertainties of the various approaches\nand results, considered in the previous sections, and summarize the phenomenological\nrelevance of the results obtained.\n2 Renormalon analysis at large Nf\nFirst, we briefly review the much easier vector case, where the Ward identity Z1 = Z2\nprotects the renormalon chain from UV disturbance, by cancellations between the two-\nloop skeletons into which the chain is inserted. All of these vector methods are necessary\nhere, though they are not sufficient. Then we turn to the scalar case, which requires more\npowerful techniques, since there is no Ward identity to protect the insertions. Our aim is\nto handle both UV-divergent two-loop skeletons exactly, and to renormalize the mass to\nall orders in Nf\u03b1s at large Nf , so as to achieve an MS-renormalized result that connects\nthe full two-loop result to the large-Nf renormalons, checking en route the O(1\/Nf) terms\nin the 3-loop correlator and 4-loop imaginary part that were given in [1].\nIn the interests of transparency, we describe the situation at large-Nf , in the first\ninstance, since this is a well-defined limit. Only later do we allow ourselves the prevailing\nluxury of believing that this has anything to do with QCD. By presenting things this way,\nwe allow the reader to distinguish hard (and also new) analysis from more easy (and also\nold) conjecture.\n2.1 Combinatorics of vector resummation\nConsider the formal series\n\u03a0V (b, \u03b5) = \u2212\n\u2211\nn>1\n(\nb\nb\u2212 \u03b5\n)n\u22121\nL(\u03b5, n\u03b5)\nn\n(2)\nwhere the multiloop generating function\nL(\u03b5, \u03b4) =\n\u2211\nj,k\u22650\nLj,k\u03b5\nj\u03b4k (3)\nis regular near \u03b5 = \u03b4 = 0. Here b stands for a renormalized coupling chosen such that the\nlarge-Nf beta function vanishes at b = \u03b5 in d \u2261 4\u22122\u03b5 dimensions. In (2), the denominator\n3\nb \u2212 \u03b5 comes from transforming the bare to the renormalized coupling. For example, in\nminimally subtracted large-Nf QED, the bare charge e0 is related to b = Nf\u03b1(\u00b5\n2)\/3\u03c0 by\ne20\n4\u03c02\n=\n3b\n1\u2212 b\/\u03b5\n(\u00b52\/4\u03c0)\u03b5\u0393(1\u2212 2\u03b5)\n[\u0393(1\u2212 \u03b5)]2\u0393(1 + \u03b5)\n(4)\nwhere \u00b52 makes b dimensionless, and the \u0393 functions make one-loop massless two-point\ndiagrams rational in \u03b5 at euclidean momentum \u00b52 = Q2.\nNow we resum the series by collecting powers of the renormalized coupling, obtaining\n\u03a0V (b, \u03b5) =\n\u2211\nn>1\nbn\u22121\n\u2211\nk<n\nCn,k\n\u03b5k\n(5)\nwhere the Laurent series at n > 1 loops starts, by assumption, with 1\/\u03b5n\u22121. At any order\nin renormalized perturbation theory, there are only two significant terms, namely [14]\nCn,1 =\nLn\u22122,0\nn(n\u2212 1)\n(6)\nCn,0 =\nLn\u22121,0\nn(n\u2212 1)\n+ (\u22121)n(n\u2212 2)!L0,n\u22121 (7)\nwhich are obtained by formal combinatorics. The first result determines the n-loop contri-\nbution to the anomalous dimension; the second gives the finite part. Thus, in this simple\nvector case, protected by the Ward identity Z1 = Z2, it is not necessary to know everything\nabout the master n-loop integral L(\u03b5, n\u03b5), resulting from a chain of n \u2212 2 fermion loops\nin a pair of two-loop skeletons. It suffices to know L(\u03b5, 0) and L(0, \u03b4), i.e. the analytic\ncontinuation to zero loops, and the Borel limit \u03b5\u2192 0, with \u03b4 = n\u03b5 fixed.\n2.2 Analysis of vector resummation\nIn the case of the correlator of the vector current, the analytical problem was solved in\nclosed form by the first author, who obtained [14]\nL(\u03b5, 0) =\n(1 + \u03b5)(1\u2212 2\u03b5)(1\u2212 2\u03b5\/3)\nB(2\u2212 \u03b5, 2\u2212 \u03b5)\u0393(3\u2212 \u03b5)\u0393(1 + \u03b5)\n, (8)\nL(0, \u03b4) =\n(\n\u00b52e5\/3\nQ2\n)\u03b4\n32\n2\u2212 \u03b4\n\u221e\u2211\nk=2\n(\u22121)kk\n(k2 \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b4)2)2\n. (9)\nThe simple \u0393-function result (8) was long since known from [44]. The all-orders re-\nsult (9) of [14] is in agreement with the independently calculated perturbative expansion\nof Ref.[45]. At two loops,\nL(0, 0) = 16\n\u221e\u2211\nk=2\n(\u22121)kk\n(k2 \u2212 1)2\n= 3 (10)\ngives the Jost-Luttinger [46] singularity, when b = \u03b1\/3\u03c0.\n4\nBefore explaining how to solve the demanding case of the scalar correlator, we need to\nexplain how the far easier vector case was handled. At n-loops, there are two diagrams: in\nthe first a chain of n\u22122 fermion loops dresses a fermion line; in the second, it is exchanged\nbetween fermion and antifermion. The first case is easy: only \u0393 functions occur; the second\nis hard: there is an F3,2 hypergeometric series of the form given in [47]. However, this\nseries is needed only in the Borel limit, where it gives a trigamma function. The series\nexpansion in \u03b4 of the 4-dimensional two-point two-loop scalar diagram, with a modification\n(1\/k2)1+\u03b4 of the momentum dependence of the totally internal propagator, is [47]\nI(\u03b4) = 8\n\u2211\nl>0\n\u03b6(2l + 1)l(1\u2212 4\u2212l)\u03b42l\u22122 (11)\nwith I(0) = 6\u03b6(3) giving the familiar unmodified result (see e.g.[48]). The renormalon\nseries in (9) is obtained from the powerful trigamma identity\n4(1\u2212 \u03b4)\n\u221e\u2211\nk=2\n(\u22121)kk\n(k2 \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b4)2)2\n=\n1\n(1\u2212 \u03b4)2\n\u2212\n1\n(2\u2212 \u03b4)2\n\u2212\n\u03b4\n2\nI(\u03b4) (12)\nwhich cancels the singularities of (11) at both \u03b4 = 1 and \u03b4 = 2. The vector result (9) has\ndouble poles at the negative integers, and at positive integers greater than 2. Yet it has\nno pole at \u03b4 = 1 and merely a single pole at \u03b4 = 2. In the QCD case, the pole at \u03b4 = 2\nsignals the need to absorb long-distance effects into a nonperturbative gluon condensate,\nat order 1\/Q4. No pole can appear at \u03b4 = 1 since there is no dimension-2 gauge-invariant\noperator in the massless theory that could produce nonperturbative effects of order 1\/Q2.\nThe appearance of e5\/3 in (9) is easy to understand: in d \u2261 4\u2212 2\u03b5 dimensions, each of the\nn\u2212 2 one-loop insertions brings with it a factor\nf(\u03b5) \u2261\n3\n4\n(\n1\nd\u2212 1\n+\n1\nd\u2212 3\n)\n= 1 +\n5\u03b5\n3\n+O(\u03b52) (13)\ngiving [f(\u03b5)]n\u22122 \u2192 exp(5\u03b4\/3), in the Borel limit. To suppress it, one may set \u00b52 =\nQ2 exp(\u22125\/3), in the MS scheme, corresponding to the perhaps more physical procedure\nof subtracting the one-loop photon propagator at Q2, in the MOM-scheme in QED or\nV -scheme in QCD (for its 2-loop definition see Ref.[49]).\n2.3 Combinatoric and analytic complexity in the scalar case\nIn the case of the correlator of the scalar current m\u03c8\u03c8 both the combinatorics and the\nanalysis are more demanding. The behaviour at large Q2 and large Nf is given by\n\u03a0S = \u03a01(\u03b5)\n(\n1 + 2CF\nIA(b, \u03b5) + IB(b, \u03b5)\nTFNf\n+O(1\/Q2) +O(1\/N2f )\n)\n(14)\n\u03a01(\u03b5) \u2261 \u22122[m(\u00b5\n2)]2Q2dF\n(\u00b52\/Q2)\u03b5\n\u03b5(1\u2212 2\u03b5)\n(15)\nIA(b, \u03b5) \u2261\n\u222b b\n0\ng(x)\n\u03b5\u2212 x\ndx (16)\nIB(b, \u03b5) \u2261\n\u2211\nn>1\n(\nb\nb\u2212 \u03b5\n)n\u22121\nG(\u03b5, n\u03b5)\nn(n\u2212 1)\n(17)\n5\nwith b \u2261 TFNf\u03b1s(\u00b5\n2)\/3\u03c0 giving the large-Nf contribution to the beta function. Here Nf\nis the number of fermion flavours, CF is the value of quadratic Casimir operator in the\nfundamental fermion representation, dF is the dimensionality of this representation, and TF\nspecifies the normalization of the corresponding matrices. Concretely, CF = 4\/3, dF = 3,\nand TF = 1\/2, in QCD. In the abelian case of QED, we simply set CF = dF = TF = 1.\nThe stumbling block is the MS-renormalized mass m(\u00b52) in the one-loop term (15).\nRenormalization of the scalar vertices is mandatory: without it the discontinuity of \u03a0S in\nthe physical (i.e. minkowski) region \u2212Q2 = s > 0 would be infinite at \u03b5 = 0. At large Nf ,\nthe multiplicative renormalization Zm = m0\/m(\u00b5\n2) may be considered as additive, with a\nvertex counterterm Zm \u2212 1 giving integral (16). The numerator g of the integrand is the\nall-orders contribution to the anomalous mass dimension\n\u03b3m(\u03b1s) =\nd logm(\u00b52)\nd log(\u00b52)\n= \u2212\nCF b\nTFNf\ng(b) +O(1\/N2f ) (18)\nat large Nf . The one-loop value g(0) = 9\/4 gives \u03b3m(\u03b1s) = \u2212\u03b1s\/\u03c0 +O(\u03b1\n2\ns) in QCD.\nIt is straightforward to insert a chain of fermion loops in the one-loop diagram for the\nscalar vertex and obtain the critical exponent\ng(\u03b5) =\n(d\u2212 1)2\nd\n\u0393(d\u2212 2)\n[\u0393(d\/2)]2\nsin \u03c0\u03b5\n\u03c0\u03b5\n(19)\nat large Nf in d \u2261 4\u22122\u03b5 dimensions, giving the all-orders result for g(b) in (18), by virtue\nof the fixed point at b = \u03b5, to leading order in 1\/Nf . We note, for future reference, that\ng(\u03b5) is finite for all d > \u22121, and hence that g(b) is finite for b < 5\/2. The validity of (19),\nfor all d > \u22121, is the true origin of the one-loop result g(0) = 9\/4, at d = 4.\nAnomalous dimensions at O(1\/Nf) are given by functions that differ from (19) only by\nmultiplication of a rational function of d. The O(1\/N2f ) term in (18) was found in [50] in the\ncase of QED, and very recently in [51] for the yet more demanding nonabelian case of QCD.\nThere one finds derivatives of \u0393 functions, which still give zeta values. At O(1\/N3f ), hyper-\ngeometric series [47] give multiple zeta values (MZVs), such as \u03b6(5, 3) =\n\u2211\nm>n>0 1\/m\n5n3,\nin anomalous dimensions. This irreducible MZV already occurs at O(1\/Nf) in the \u03b5-\nexpansion of the multiloop generator G(\u03b5, n\u03b5) in (17).\nEven the handling of the vertex renormalization (16), at large n, is nontrivial. For\nthe n-loop term in the scalar correlator, one needs to expand the \u0393 functions and ra-\ntionals of (19) to order \u03b5n\u22122, and then make a further Laurent expansion of the in-\ntegrand. After integration, this three-fold series gets multiplied by\n\u2211\nk\u22650 2\nk\u03b5k\u22121, from\nthe one-loop term. The fifth and final series is the most potent: one must multiply by\n(\u00b52\/Q2)\u03b5 =\n\u2211\nk\u22650(L\u03b5)\nk\/k! with the resulting complicated dependence on L \u2261 log(\u00b52\/Q2)\nrequired to cancel nonlocal terms in the Laurent expansion of the multiloop diagrams.\nThus the innocent-looking integral (16) generates a combinatoric plethora of products of\nrationals, zeta-values, powers of 1\/\u03b5, powers of the coupling, and powers of logs. And thus\nfar we speak only of the analytically tractable term, free of the MZVs that occur in true\nmultiloop diagrams.\n6\nNext one sees, in IB, the astounding interconnectedness of perturbative quantum field\ntheory: there is a vast conspiracy, on a scale that would be ludicrous in human affairs,\nbetween analytically nontrivial n-loop integrals in (17), where G(\u03b5, n\u03b5) entails the F3,2\nhypergeometric series of [47], and the 5-fold series from the intricate combinatorical pro-\ncessing of g(\u03b5) by vertex renormalization. Everyone knows what this conspiracy must\nachieve: total cancellation of logs from the singular terms, as required by the locality of\ncounterterms. How, one asks, is this conspiracy coordinated? Its success is not in doubt:\nfield theory cannot fail. Yet nothing, prior to this work, appeared to indicate the analytical\nmechanism.\nClearly the analysis of the vector case cannot solve this problem. Both of its key\nassumptions are now vitiated. First, the n-loop terms in (17) have a form that does\nnot conform to (5); secondly, Laurent expansion of either (16) or (17) generates a 1\/\u03b5n\nsingularity at n loops, in defiance of the restriction k < n in (5). It was the Ward identity\nZ1 = Z2 of QED, and hence of QCD at large Nf , that protected us from these eventualities\nin the vector case, by giving one less factor of 1\/\u03b5, and by allowing an Ansatz (5), with\nno singularity at n = 1.\n2.4 Reconciliation in the scalar case\nHow is progress possible in this complex scalar case? By virtue of our recent finding that\nG(\u03b5, \u03b5) = g(\u03b5) (20)\nwhich expresses the remarkable fact that analytic continuation to n = 1, of the hypergeo-\nmetric result for inserting chains of n\u22122 one-loop diagrams in a pair of two-loop skeletons,\ngives the anomalous dimension, to all orders in the coupling at large Nf . To prove (20),\none must first show that the irreducibly hypergeometric terms in G(\u03b5, \u03b4) vanish at \u03b4 = \u03b5,\nhence cancelling the new singularity at n = 1 in (17), which was not encountered in the\nWard-protected vector analysis, based on (2). Thanks to the systematic hypergeometric\nmethods of [47] this is now possible. The surviving terms in the analytic continuation to\nn = 1 then give \u0393 functions, multiplied by a very complicated rational function of \u03b5 and\n\u03b4. At \u03b4 = \u03b5, the match of G(\u03b5, \u03b5) to the critical exponent g(\u03b5) is perfect.\nThis enables us to organize both the combinatorics and the analysis, by writing\nG(\u03b5, \u03b4) = g(\u03b5)\nG2(\u03b5, \u03b4)\nG1(\u03b5, \u03b4)\n{1 + (\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b5) [GE(\u03b5) +GD(\u03b4) + \u03b5\u03b4G3(\u03b5, \u03b4)]} (21)\nwith a prefactor specified by\nG1(\u03b5, \u03b4) \u2261\n(\n\u00b52\nQ2\n(f(\u03b5))1\/\u03b5\n)\u03b5\u2212\u03b4\n(22)\nG2(\u03b5, \u03b4) \u2261\n\u0393(1 + \u03b4)\n\u0393(1 + \u03b4 \u2212 2\u03b5)\n\u0393(1\u2212 \u03b4 + \u03b5)\n\u0393(1\u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b5)\n\u0393(1\u2212 2\u03b5)\u0393(1\u2212 \u03b5)\n\u0393(1 + \u03b5)\n(23)\n7\nand functions of \u03b5 and \u03b4 that we eventually obtain, by hypergeometric analysis, as\nGE(\u03b5) = \u03b5(1\u2212 2\u03b5) (24)\nGD(\u03b4) =\n2\n1\u2212 \u03b4\n\u2212\n1\n2\u2212 \u03b4\n+\n8(1\u2212 \u03b4)\n3\n\u221e\u2211\nk=2\n(\u22121)kk\n(k2 \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b4)2)2\n(25)\n=\n\u2211\nk>0\nk + 3\n3\n(2\u2212 2\u2212k)\u03b4k\u22121 \u2212\n8\n3\n\u2211\nl>0\n\u03b6(2l + 1)l(1\u2212 4\u2212l)\u03b42l\u22121 (26)\nwith (25) showing the renormalon structure and (26) giving the Taylor expansion about\n\u03b4 = 0, thanks to (11,12). As in the vector case [14, 18] no even zeta value can occur in the\nexpansion of the renormalon contributions, since I(\u03b4) = I(\u2212\u03b4) is conformally invariant.\nIn the new scalar result (26) one has the further simplification that odd zeta values occur\nonly in odd Taylor coefficients. The vastly more complicated residuum, G3, which we also\ndetermined completely, makes no contribution to either the anomalous dimension or the\nfinite part, since it is multiplied by a factor that vanishes at \u03b4 = \u03b5, \u03b4 = 0, and \u03b5 = 0,\ncorresponding to n = 1, n = 0, and n \u2192 \u221e. After extracting unity, GE, and GD, one\nmay simply throw away whatever remains in G3. We did this the hard way, by calculating\neverything, exactly.\nThe highly coordinated conspiracy (20) is signalled by the leading unity in the braces\nof (21), and the triviality of G1(\u03b5, \u03b5) = 1. Moreover, the remarkable combination of \u0393\nfunctions in (23) gives G2(\u03b5, \u03b5) = G2(\u03b5, 0) = G2(0, \u03b4) = 1, which means that we may\nset G2 to unity, without the slightest effect on the outcome, for the same reason that we\nmay set G3 to zero. Next we note that (24) precisely cancels the rational denominator\nof the one-loop term (15): this renormalon-free term is as simple as one could ever hope.\nInspecting the analytic structure of the nontrivial renormalon contribution (25) we see\nsingle poles at \u03b4 = 1 and \u03b4 = 2. The pole at \u03b4 = 2 corresponds to the appearance\nof a gluon-condensate contribution of order m2Q2\u3008G\u00b5,\u03bdG\n\u00b5,\u03bd\u3009\/Q4 in \u03a0S. This was to be\nexpected, by analogy with the vector case.\nThe totally new feature is the pole at \u03b4 = 1, reflecting the ambiguity of the constant\nterm in the correlator, which is infinite, though formally proportional to m4, in pertur-\nbation theory, while current algebra relates it to \u3008m\u03c8\u03c8\u3009. It is wonderful that an analysis\nof finite parts of massless diagrams at large loop numbers can so powerfully remind one\nof what one knows from massive diagrams [3] at low loop numbers, namely that the UV\nphysics of the second subtraction in the dispersion relation is as profound as that of the\nfirst. It makes no sense to say that at large Q2 we can forget about the second UV sub-\ntraction, because m2\/Q2 is small. If we make believe that we can, the \u03b4 = 1 infrared\n(IR) renormalon of massless diagrams will remind us of the ultraviolet physics of massive\ndiagrams. It was, of course, the Ward identity that protected us from this consideration\nin the vector case.\nProceeding, we see that the closed forms (24,25) lead to renormalized contributions\nthat are speedily found, to very high orders, by the combinatorics (6,7) that served in the\nvector analysis of [14], where results were obtained up to 20 loops, analytically, and up to\n100 loops, numerically. It remains, however, to resum the leading term in (21). We may\nset G2 = 1, and write 1\/G1 = (1\u2212G1)\/G1 +1, with only the final unity requiring further\n8\nattention. That is now feasible, since the formal transformation\n\u2211\nn>1\n(\nb\nb\u2212 \u03b5\n)n\u22121\n1\nn(n\u2212 1)\n= 1 +\n\u03b5\nb\nlog\n(\n1\u2212\nb\n\u03b5\n)\n= \u2212\n\u2211\nn>1\n(\nb\n\u03b5\n)n\u22121\n1\nn\n(27)\ngives a rather simple Laurent series, when multiplied by g(\u03b5) =\n\u2211\nn>0 gn\u03b5\nn\u22121. Finally, we\nexpand 1\/(\u03b5\u2212 x) in x\/\u03b5 and formally integrate (16).\nTidying up, we see that IA+ IB is equivalent to JA+JB, as far as pole terms and finite\nparts are concerned, where\nJA(b, \u03b5) \u2261\n\u2211\nn>1\nbn\u22121\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3\nn\u22121\u2211\nj=1\ngn\u2212j\u03b5\n\u2212j\nn(n\u2212 1)\n\u2212\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\ngn+k\u03b5\nk\nn\n\uf8fc\uf8fd\uf8fe (28)\ncombines IA with the recalcitrant leading term from IB, and the remainder of IB is equiv-\nalent to\nJB(b, \u03b5) \u2261 \u03b5g(\u03b5)\n\u2211\nn>1\n(\nb\nb\u2212 \u03b5\n)n\u22121\nLB(\u03b5, n\u03b5)\nG1(\u03b5, n\u03b5)\n1\nn\n(29)\nwhere\nLB(\u03b5, \u03b4) \u2261\nG1(\u03b5, \u03b4)\u2212 1\n\u03b5\u2212 \u03b4\n+ \u03b5(1\u2212 2\u03b5) +GD(\u03b4) (30)\nis easily processed by (6,7), using (19,22,25). It is important to note that JA is no longer\nminimal: the first sum combines pure pole terms of IA, with weight 1\/(n\u22121), and the pole\nterms from multiplication of g(\u03b5) by (27), with weight \u22121\/n. Then a regular part appears,\nin the second series of JA. The overall 1\/\u03b5 singularity, from the one-loop diagram, means\nthat the k = 0 term in (28) becomes singular, and the k = 1 term becomes finite. This\nwill be seen to be crucial, in the following analysis.\n2.5 Critical behaviour of the scalar correlator\nNow we analyze the so-called scalar-scalar anomalous dimension, \u03b3SS, defined by [1](\n\u2202\n\u2202 log \u00b52\n+ \u03b2(\u03b1s)\n\u2202\n\u2202 log\u03b1s\n+ 2\u03b3m(\u03b1s)\n)\n\u03a0S = [m(\u00b5\n2)]2Q2\n{\n\u03b3SS(\u03b1s) +O\n(\nm2\nQ2\n)}\n(31)\nThe presence of an O(m2\/Q2) term in the braces on the r.h.s. of the renormalization-group\nequation (31) reminds us that two subtractions [42] are required for the scalar correlator.\nHere we are concerned with the first, which produces a scale dependence described by \u03b3SS.\nIf one supposes that the second might be forgotten at large Q2, the unity of field theory\nsoon corrects one: we have already seen that the finite parts of massless diagrams at large\nloop numbers are profoundly aware of the O(m2\/Q2) UV physics in (31), via the \u03b4 = 1 IR\nrenormalon in (25), at m2\/Q2 = 0.\nWorking to leading order in 1\/Q2, and next-to-leading order in 1\/Nf , we write\n\u03a0S = [m(\u00b5\n2)]2Q2dF\n(\n\u22122L\u2212 4 +\nCF b\nTFNf\nH(L, b) +O(1\/Q2) +O(1\/N2f )\n)\n(32)\n\u03b3SS = dF\n(\n\u22122 +\nCF b\nTFNf\nh(b) +O(1\/N2f )\n)\n(33)\n9\nwhere b \u2261 TFNf\u03b1s\/3\u03c0 is the leading term of the 4-dimensional beta function at large Nf ,\ni.e. the value of \u01eb such that the critical dimension is 4 \u2212 2\u03b5. Hence the renormalization-\ngroup equation (31) simplifies to(\n\u2202\n\u2202L\n+ \u03b52\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b5\n)\n\u03b5H(L, \u03b5) + 4(L+ 2)\u03b5g(\u03b5) = \u03b5h(\u03b5) (34)\nwhere L \u2261 log(\u00b52\/Q2). Our aim is to determine h(\u03b5) to all orders. Then the dependence\nof H(L, b) on L is completely determined by H(0, b).\nWe stress the underlying principle of this work by using the argument \u03b5 in (34), where\na reader more used to 4-dimensional perturbation theory might reasonably expect to see\nus choose b \u2261 TFNf\u03b1s\/3\u03c0. The reason should be clear: the large-Nf beta function is b\u2212\u03b5\nin d \u2261 4\u2212 2\u03b5 dimensions, where \u03b5 need not be small. By working near the critical point,\nb = \u03b5, without assuming that d is near 4, we bypass perturbation theory.\nWe have remarked that true anomalous dimensions differ from (19) only by rational\nfunctions of d, at order 1\/Nf . Of course the beta function is not such an object, since\nit vanishes at the fixed point, by definition. The reason why the O(1\/Nf) corrections to\nthe 4-dimensional QED beta function are given by the integral of (8) is clear: the physics\nresides in the critical exponent that is the derivative of this integral. In the scalar case,\nthe critical exponent is the derivative of \u03b5h(\u03b5) + 4g(\u03b5). With some ingenuity, one may\nobtain it by careful parsing of (28,30), which yield\n1\ng(\u03b5)\nd\nd\u03b5\n(\n\u03b5h(\u03b5) + 4g(\u03b5)\n4\n)\n=\n(d\u2212 3)2\n3\n\u2212 2 . (35)\nHere, in short order, is the proof of this fine parabola:\n1\nd\u2212 3\n{\n2\u2212\n(f(\u03b5)\u2212 1)\/\u03b5+ \u03b5(1\u2212 2\u03b5) + 2\nf(\u03b5)\n}\n=\n1\u2212 f(\u03b5)\u2212 \u03b52\n\u03b5f(\u03b5)\n=\n(d\u2212 3)2\n3\n\u2212 2 (36)\nwith a seemingly troublesome singularity at d = 3 turning out to give a harmless minimum.\nThe prefactor 1\/(d\u22123) = 1\/(1\u22122\u03b5) comes from the one-loop result (15). The first term in\nbraces comes from the first series in JA; the remainder from setting \u03b4 = 0 in LB. The weight\nof the series is doubled by the shift 1\/\u03b5(1\u22122\u03b5) = 1\/\u03b5+2\/(1\u22122\u03b5); the fourth term follows\nfrom using (10) in (25), which gives GD(0) = 2. By taking the derivative of \u03b5h(\u03b5)+ 4g(\u03b5),\nwe remove the nonminimal series in JA, whose weight, 1\/n, is incommensurate with (6),\nwhich we use for the JB terms. The rational function f(\u03b5) enters via (22). Taking the\nexact one-loop vector result from (13), we obtain parabola (35).\nRecall what makes this possible: the circumstance (20) that analytic continuation\nof the hypergeometric series of [47] to n = 1, i.e. to minus one insertions, reproduces\nthe large-Nf anomalous mass dimension to all orders in the coupling. We began with\ntwo bad problems, for which the vector analysis gave no preparation: first we had an\nextra singularity, vitiating the combinatorics; secondly we had incommensurate weights\nfor mass renormalization and those terms that we could handle. The beauty of (20) is that\nit enabled us to solve both problems at the same time: transferring the combinatorically\n10\nrecalcitrant term to join the mass renormalization in JA, we obtained the desired weight\nas 1\/(n \u2212 1) \u2212 1\/n = 1\/n(n \u2212 1), in conformity with (6). There was a price to pay:\nthis transfer took a nonminimal term with it. But that was no problem: we knew from\ncritical phenomena that we must take a derivative, so as to obtain a physically significant\nexponent. In that derivative we must include the precise multiple of g(\u03b5) that kills the\nnonminimal terms.\nThe road from analysis of the Saalschutzian F3,2 series of multiloop [47] diagrams, to the\nsimple parabola (35), was a long one. Along it there was a narrow bridge: G(\u03b5, \u03b5) = g(\u03b5).\nWe have found no other route.\n2.6 Analytical results at large Nf\nRecalling that b \u2261 TFNf\u03b1s\/3\u03c0, we obtain\n\u03b3SS(\u03b1s) = dF\n(\n\u22122 +\nCF\u03b1s\n3\u03c0\n\u2211\nn>1\n(\nTFNf\n\u03b1s\n3\u03c0\n)n\u22122\n{hn +O(1\/Nf)}\n)\n(37)\nwhere h(\u03b5) =\n\u2211\nn>1 hn\u03b5\nn\u22122.

By this means analytical results to 20 loops, and numerical results\nto 100 loops, are readily obtainable. Since g(\u03b5) is finite for \u03b5 < 5\/2, so is h(\u03b5). Hence\n11\nthe coefficients decrease rather rapidly, with hn = O((2\/5)\nn). For example, we found that\nh16 \u2248 1.867\u00d7 10\n\u22125.\nThis convergence is in marked contrast with the behaviour of the finite parts. Writing\nH(L, b) =\n\u2211\nn>1 Hn(L)b\nn\u22122, we used (28,30) to derive the all-orders solution\nn(n\u2212 1)Hn(L) = n(hn+1 \u2212 4(L+ 2)gn) + 4gn+1 \u2212 9(\u22121)\nnDn(L) (41)\u2211\nn\nDn(L)\u03b4\nn\/n! = {1 + \u03b4GD(\u03b4)} exp((L+ 5\/3)\u03b4) (42)\nof the renormalization-group equation (34). Two good checks are provided by the vanishing\nof the r.h.s. of (41) at n = 0 and n = 1, using g1 = 9\/4, h2 = 4g2 = \u221215\/2 and GD(0) = 2.\nTwo stronger checks are provided by known results at two [3] and three [1] loops. We\nobtain from (41) the entirety of the former and the large-Nf terms of the latter, for all\n\u00b52\/Q2. At \u00b52 = Q2, we write Hn \u2261 Hn(0). In [1], we find\nH2 = 3\n[\n\u2212\n131\n8\n+ 6\u03b6(3)\n]\n, H3 = 9\n[\n511\n36\n\u2212 4\u03b6(3)\n]\n, (43)\nat \u00b52 = Q2.\nIn order to extend explicit results to high loop numbers, and to analyze their UV and\nIR renormalon content, we separate GD(\u03b4) = G\u2212(\u03b4) +G+(\u03b4) into\nG\u2212(\u03b4) = \u2212\n2\n3\n\u2211\nk>0\n(\u22121)k\n(k + \u03b4)2\n(44)\nG+(\u03b4) =\n2\n1\u2212 \u03b4\n\u2212\n1\n2\u2212 \u03b4\n+\n2\n3\n\u2211\nk>2\n(\u22121)k\n(k \u2212 \u03b4)2\n(45)\nand expand in \u03b4. (Note however that the Taylor expansion of the total renormalon con-\ntribution is already given with great economy by (26), with odd zeta values in odd Taylor\ncoefficients.) Computation of analytical results to 20 loops takes seconds, for any value of\nL \u2261 log(\u00b52\/Q2).

At truly large Nf , they give\nsign-constant series. Now we imagine that, in some vague1 sense, the gluon loops \u201cfollow\u201d\nthe quark loops. Hence we perform the naive nonabelianization [15] Nf \u2192 Nf \u2212\n11Nc\n2\n(Nc = 3), which gives b \u2192 \u2212\u03b20\u03b1s(\u00b5\n2)\/\u03c0, with \u03b20 = (11Nc \u2212 2Nf)\/12 giving the relative\ncontributions of gluons and quarks in the one-loop beta function of QCD. In the real\nword, with Nf \u2264 6 active quarks, we have \u03b20 > 0 and b \u2261 \u03b20\u03b1s(\u00b5)\/\u03c0 \u2248 1\/ log(Q\n2\/\u039b2), if\nwe suppress large logarithms by renormalizing at \u00b52 = Q2. By this sleight of hand, the\nsingularities at \u03b4 < 0 now give a sign-alternating asymptotic series that is resummable by\nLaplace transformation. A singularity at \u03b4 > 0 leads to an intrinsic ambiguity of order\nexp(\u2212\u03b4\/b) = O(Q\u22122\u03b4) in a dimensionless correlator. In the vector case (25) the dominant\nambiguity, at \u03b4 = 2, is associated with the gluon condensate. Here, in the scalar case\nwith \u03a0S = O(Q\n2), a singularity at \u03b4 > 0 leads to an ambiguity of order Q2\u22122\u03b4. Hence the\nrenormalon at \u03b4 = 1 is in accord with the fact that the constant term in \u03a0S is inaccessible\nto perturbation theory. Interestingly, our analysis does not distinguish the scalar from the\npseudoscalar channel. In the latter case, current algebra relates the constant term in the\ncorrelator to the quark condensate \u3008m\u03c8\u03c8\u3009.\nAt any given order n > 1, we may separate Hn into 6 parts:\nHn = H\nMS\nn +H\n(0)\nn +H\n(\u2212)\nn +H\n(1)\nn +H\n(2)\nn +H\n(+)\nn (46)\nwhere\nHMSn =\nn(hn+1 \u2212 4(L+ 2)gn) + 4gn+1\nn(n\u2212 1)\n(47)\nis the highly convergent part from MS renormalization and H(0)n comes from the lead-\ning unity in the braces of (42). The next term comes from (44), with resummable UV\nrenormalon singularities at \u03b4 < 0; final three terms come from the IR renormalons in (45).\nTable 1 shows the numerics of this breakdown, again at \u00b52 = Q2. We comment on\neach contribution in turn.\n1. The MS-specific contribution HMSn = O((2\/5)\nn) is negligible at large n. This is\nbecause the critical exponent (19) is finite at all dimensions d > \u22121. The numerator\nof (8) shows that the same applies to the critical exponent in the vector case.\n2. The modest growth of H(0)n comes from the choice \u00b5\n2 = Q2, made so as to com-\npare (43) with [1]. At \u00b52 = Q2 exp(\u22125\/3), corresponding to QED MOM- or V-\nschemes subtraction of quark-loop insertions, these terms fall off like 1\/n2.\n3. The series coming from H(\u2212)n is now regarded as infrared-safe: one may resum it by\nLaplace transformation of the Borel transform (44), obtaining\n\u2211\nn>1\nH(\u2212)n (L)[\u2212b]\nn\u22121 = 9\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nG\u2212(\u03b4) exp((5\/3 + L)\u03b4)\u2212G\u2212(0)\n\u03b4\nexp(\u2212\u03b4\/b) d\u03b4 (48)\n1It must be vague. Unlike quark loops, gluon loops are not gauge invariant.\n13\nwhere b \u2248 1\/ log(\u00b52\/\u039b2) replaces \u2212b, by naive nonabelianization.\n4. The total is dominated by the factorial growth of H(1)n = O((n \u2212 2)!). Indeed\nthis dominant \u03b4 = 1 IR renormalon even gives a reasonable account at very low\norders. For example, it gives a fraction 73.0\/84.5 = 86% of the 3-loop large-Nf\nresult of [1]. Clearly perturbation theory would be in bad shape, if this renormalon\nentered phenomenology. Fortunately it does not. Rather it is a reminder, from the\nperturbative sector, of the long-distance physics in \u03a0S(0), which current algebra\nrelates to quark condensates. In the sum-rule analysis of [9], it was nullified by\ntaking a twice-subtracted dispersion relation. In Higgs decay and spectral function\nof the QCD sum rules, it is nullified by taking the imaginary part, in the physical\nregion s = \u2212Q2 > 0.\nAs previously remarked, one must set aside the temptation to divide \u03a0S by Q\n2 and\nthen differentiate w.r.t. Q2, so as to remove \u03b3SS from (31). That would not remove\nthe \u03b4 = 1 renormalon, since it would leave the kinematic singularity \u03a0S(0)\/Q\n4. Then\nlong-distance physics would make the asymptotic perturbation series expire sooner\nthan needs be, since it is always faithful to the motto dulce et decorum est pro\nWilson mori: it\u2019s OK to explode in accordance with Wilson\u2019s OPE. Indeed, it often\nsignals impending doom at the 2-loop level [15].\n5. More long-distance physics resides in H(2)n = O((n\u2212 2)!\/2\nn), which signals the pres-\nence of the gluon condensate in Wilson\u2019s scheme of things, as articulated in QCD\nby [26]. This \u03b4 = 2 IR renormalon is also absent from the imaginary part, to lead-\ning order in 1\/s. When taking an imaginary part, in the physical region, one kills\nany single-pole renormalon, and turns a double-pole into a single pole, since the\nimaginary part of (42) acquires a factor sin(\u03c0\u03b4). The quark and gluon dimension-4\noperators appear in the energy momentum tensor and are hence renormalization-\ngroup invariants, to leading order. Thus they are absent from the imaginary part,\nat order 1\/\u03b20, in the high-energy limit. Since there is no matrix element to absorb\nrenormalons at \u03b4 = 1 or \u03b4 = 2, these, and only these, appear as single poles in (25).\n6. The only IR (i.e. unresummable) large-\u03b20 renormalons that appear in the imaginary\npart at large s, are those in H(+)n , at \u03b4 > 2. These correspond to long-distance\nphysics in matrix elements of operators Ok with dimensions dk \u2265 6 in the OPE. The\nresultant ambiguity in Im \u03a0S is of order m\n2\u3008Ok\u3009\/s\ndk\u22121.\n2.8 Analysis of the imaginary part at large Nf\nTable 1 might appear alarming. A far happier picture emerges in Table 2, where we\nanalyze a physical quantity, namely the imaginary part Im \u03a0S = 2\u03c0sRS(1 + O(1\/s)) at\n\u2212Q2 = s \u2261 w2. For w = MH , this contains the radiative corrections to decay of a Higgs\nboson of mass MH into a quark-antiquark pair, ignoring terms of order (m(M\n2\nH)\/MH)\n2.\nNow we are dealing with a multiplicatively renormalized quantity: the explicit dependence\n14\nof RS on \u00b5\n2 is cancelled by its implicit dependence, via \u03b1s(\u00b5\n2) and m(\u00b52), giving(\n\u2202\n\u2202 log\u00b52\n+ \u03b2(\u03b1s)\n\u2202\n\u2202 log\u03b1s\n+ 2\u03b3m(\u03b1s)\n)\nRS = 0 (49)\nwith 2\u03b3m appearing because RS contains two powers of the renormalized mass in the Born\napproximation. We should, however, set \u00b52 = O(s), to suppress large logarithms. Here,\nwe set \u00b52 = s \u2261 w2 and obtain\nRS = 3[m(w)]\n2\n(\n1 +\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n\u2211\nn>1\nbn\u22122S {Sn +O(1\/Nf)}\n)\n(50)\nwith bS \u2261 \u2212Nf\u03b1s(w\n2)\/6\u03c0, which is replaced by \u03b20\u03b1s(w\n2)\/\u03c0 \u2248 1\/ log(w2\/\u039b2) in naive\nnonabelianization. We have S2 = 17\/3, with the large-Nf term giving the total radiative\ncorrection at 2 loops. At n \u2265 2 loops, we obtain the leading term at large-Nf as\nSn = An +\u2206n (51)\nAn =\n2(\u22121)n\nn\u2212 1\ngn\ng1\n(52)\n\u2211\nn\u22652\n\u03b4n\u22121\u2206n\n(n\u2212 2)!\n= 2 exp(5\u03b4\/3) {1 + \u03b4G\u2212(\u03b4) + \u03b4G+(\u03b4)}\nsin(\u03c0\u03b4)\n\u03c0\u03b4\n\u2212 2 (53)\nwhere gn is the n-loop term in the large-Nf result (40) for the anomalous quark-mass\ndimension. The separation Sn = An + \u2206n into anomalous-dimension and renormalon\ncontributions will be used in Sec. 3, where we shall retain only the latter in large-\u03b20\napproximations. Here, we retain both terms, so as to present the exact analytical results\nat large-Nf .\nWe note that the high-energy imaginary part RS receives powers of \u03c0\n2 from two sources:\nfrom the even zeta values {\u03b6(2k) | k > 1} of euclidean analysis, and also from the analytic\ncontinuation of logarithms to the physical region. At large-Nf , the separation of these\ntwo effects is particularly clean: even zeta values occur only in the anomalous-dimension\ncontributions An; powers of \u03c0\n2 from analytic continuation result only from the factor\nsin(\u03c0\u03b4)\/\u03c0\u03b4 in the Borel transform (53) of the renormalon contributions \u2206n. We write the\nAn terms in braces in the following large-Nf results. Up to 4 loops we obtain\nS2 =\n{\n\u2212\n5\n3\n}\n+\n22\n3\n=\n17\n3\n(54)\nS3 =\n{\n35\n36\n}\n\u2212 4\u03b6(3)\u2212\n1\n3\n\u03c02 +\n275\n18\n= \u22124\u03b6(3)\u2212\n1\n3\n\u03c02 +\n65\n4\n(55)\nS4 =\n{\n4\n3\n\u03b6(3)\u2212\n83\n108\n}\n\u2212\n40\n3\n\u03b6(3)\u2212\n22\n9\n\u03c02 +\n3940\n81\n= \u221212\u03b6(3)\u2212\n22\n9\n\u03c02 +\n15511\n324\n(56)\nwith totals in agreement the with the large-Nf 3-loop [4] and 4-loop [1] terms.

This method may easily be continued up to\n20 loops, analytically, and up to 100 loops, numerically.\nThe corresponding vector quantities in electron-positron annihilation, at large Nf ,\ncome from the old result (9) of [14], which immediately gives\n\u2211\nn>1\n\u03b4n\u22122Vn\n(n\u2212 2)!\n=\n8 exp(5\u03b4\/3)\n3(1\u2212 \u03b4)(2\u2212 \u03b4)\n\uf8eb\uf8ed\u2212\u2211\nk>0\n(\u22121)k\n(k + \u03b4)2\n+\n\u2211\nk>2\n(\u22121)k\n(k \u2212 \u03b4)2\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 sin(\u03c0\u03b4)\n\u03c0\u03b4\n(59)\nAt 6 loops the vector coefficient has grown by an order of magnitude and changed sign,\nwith V6\/V2 \u2248 \u221211. By contrast, S6\/S2 \u2248 0.5 in the scalar channel. This remarkable\npostponement of factorial growth, at large-Nf , does not depend on a cancellation between\nanomalous-dimension and renormalon terms; rather it reflects cancellations between the\nrenormalons themselves, with \u22066\/\u22062 \u2248 0.4 showing no sign of the growth that had become\nclear at 6 loops in the vector channel. In this respect, the (pseudo-)scalar channel is better\nbehaved than the (axial-)vector channel, at high energy and large Nf , despite warnings [52]\nthat might suggest an opposite situation.\n2.9 Postponed factorial growth\nConsiderable interest attaches to the numerics of Table 2, where it will be seen than Sn\nis amazingly well-behaved for n < 7, while Hn in Table 1 had already gone haywire at\nn = 3. We have discovered a plateau of tranquility at loop numbers n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, in the\nlarge-Nf terms of the imaginary part of the scalar correlator.\nThe behaviour at n > 7 in Table 2 is fairly clear.\n1. The MS term SMSn falls of like (2\/5)\nn.\n2. The leading unity of the braces of (53) gives power growth of S(0)n , modulated by a\nsine.\n3. Eventually, the UV renormalons at \u03b4 < 0 take over, giving an alternating series for\nS(\u2212)n , now that we have naively nonabelianized. But they takes ages to get going:\neven at n = 8 they have not yet overtaken the humble \u03b4 = 0 term.\n4. The term S(1)n from \u03b4 = 1 is no longer a renormalon; the single pole has been cancelled\nby sin(\u03c0\u03b4).\n5. The same applies to the \u03b4 = 2 term S(2)n , except that it is, on average, smaller than\nthe \u03b4 = 1 term, by a factor of order 1\/2n, after allowing for the sinusoidal oscillations.\n16\n6. The unresummable series with the coefficients S(+)n from the IR renormalons at \u03b4 \u2265 3\ngrows factorially, eventually. However it is suppressed by a factor of order 1\/3n, in\ncomparison with the UV renormalons.\nThe staggering feature is the tally, Sn. For n > 7, it behaves like the wild animal\nthat it truly is; for n < 7, all is sweetness and light. Presented with only the analytical\nexpressions for Sn at n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, one would not have the slightest inkling of what is in\nstore. Conversely, one may say that the large-Nf renormalons show themselves mercifully\nlate, in this physical quantity.\nNote that these statements are entirely dependent on the scheme chosen (for a dis-\ncussion of the scheme-dependence of renormalon contributions see e.g. Refs.[53, 20]). As\nwill be clear from the discussions of Sec. 3.5 and Table 5, the V -scheme results are in\nfact a much better indicator of the eventual asymptotics of the coefficients. Nonetheless\ngiven the widespread use of the MS scheme in the literature we initially focus here on the\nasymptotic behaviour in that scheme.\nNow consider the case where s = w2 with w \u2248 2 GeV, as in strange-quark mass\nextraction [9, 54]. With \u03b20 = 9\/4, the expansion parameter \u03b20\u03b1s(w)\/\u03c0 \u2248 1\/ log(w\n2\/\u00b52) \u2248\n0.2 is now uncomfortably large. Hence the tranquil plateau at n < 7 loops is good news\nfor the later analysis in [9], where 4-loop perturbative QCD was used, on both sides of the\nsum rule. The result was significantly different from an earlier 3-loop analysis in [54], by\nthe same group, using a different truncation procedure (compare with the similar 3-loop\nstudies of Ref.[55]).\nThe villains, which might have been waiting just round the corner, were the renor-\nmalons. Might a large 5-loop term significantly change the 4-loop result?\nTo date, we know of only one analytical technique for estimating such effects on the\nbasis of genuinely new calculation, instead of reshuffling old input: naive nonabelianization\nof the large-Nf terms, which we have computed in the demanding scalar channel, at some\ncost of labour. The good news is that we found nothing alarming at n = 5 loops. The\neven better news is that all seems well at n = 6 loops. Only at n = 7 does the inevitable\ngrowth show signs of commencing. Hence the best indicator that we can compute suggests\nthat the perturbative part of the strange-quark-mass extraction in [9] is in fine shape.\nIndeed, the results of Table 2 indicate that the contribution of the 5-loop coefficient\nmight be not crucial and that the corresponding perturbative series should be truncated\nat the 6-loop level in accordance with the common practice in treating the predictions\nof asymptotic perturbative expansions, which presumes their truncation at the minimal\nterm.\nThis fits nicely with the claim in [9] that the condensate contributions are also under\ncontrol. Had these contributions been substantial, our discovery of perturbative tranquility\nat large Nf would have been rather puzzling; now it may be taken as gratifying evidence\nof the depth to which the OPE connects ultraviolet and infrared physics.\n17\n2.10 Euclidean analysis at large Nf\nIn the vector channel we may express the results of high-energy perturbation theory in\ntwo ways: either in terms of R(s), in the physical region, or in terms the Adler function\nD(Q2) \u2261 Q2\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nR(s)ds\n(s+Q2)2\n(60)\nin the euclidean region. Here, R(s) = 1 + \u03b1s\/\u03c0 + O(\u03b1\n2\ns) gives the high-energy radiative\ncorrections to the parton model in electron-positron annihilation and hence D(Q2) gives\nthe corresponding radiative corrections to the derivative of the polarization function of\nthe vector correlator.\nIn both cases, we ignore quark masses, so the transformation between one set of radia-\ntive corrections and the other is generated, to all orders, by the following integral\nQ2\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nds\n(s+Q2)2\n(\n\u00b52\ns\n)\u03b4\n=\n\u03c0\u03b4\nsin(\u03c0\u03b4)\n(\n\u00b52\nQ2\n)\u03b4\n(61)\nwith the expansion of\n\u03c0\u03b4\nsin(\u03c0\u03b4)\n= 1 +\n\u2211\nk>0\n(\n2\u2212 41\u2212k\n)\n\u03b6(2k)\u03b42k (62)\ntelling one precisely how to remove from the imaginary part all and only those powers of\n\u03c02 that came from analytic continuation of logarithms.\nIn the scalar channel, we are confronted by a choice of euclideanizations of the high-\nenergy imaginary part. The most prudent choice would appear to be the dispersion relation\nfor the second derivative of the scalar correlator [42], which is multiplicatively renormalized\nfor all values of m2\/Q2 and is hence free of the IR renormalon at \u03b4 = 1 in (45). Ignoring\nterms of order m2\/Q2, this amounts to the euclideanization\nDS(Q\n2) = 2Q2\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nsRS(s)ds\n(s+Q2)3\n= 3[m(Q2)]2\n(\n1 +\n11\n3\n\u03b1s(Q\n2)\n\u03c0\n+O(\u03b12s)\n)\n(63)\nof the radiative corrections to the imaginary part at high energy. However, a merely\nmathematical analogy with the vector case might lead one to consider the construct\nD\u02dcS(Q\n2) = Q2\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nRS(s)ds\n(s +Q2)2\n= 3[m(Q2)]2\n(\n1 +\n17\n3\n\u03b1s(Q\n2)\n\u03c0\n+O(\u03b12s)\n)\n(64)\ncorresponding to a dispersion relation for the first derivative of \u03a0S(Q\n2)\/Q2. Here one\nexpects the asymptotic perturbation series to destroy itself earlier, leaving an ambiguity\nof order \u039b2\/Q2 that reflects the failure to remove the infinities in \u03a0S(0). Therefore, this\nambiguity has a perturbative origin.\nWe shall show that at large-Nf the perturbative series for the nonstandard euclideaniza-\ntion D\u02dcS is indeed worse behaved than the twice-differentiated euclideanization DS, in ac-\ncord with the expectation from the OPE. It might therefore be expected that we shall\n18\nproceed in Sec. 3 only with the safer alternative DS, as used in QCD sum-rules [42, 9].\nIn fact, we shall need both constructs, so as to study the logarithmic derivative of D\u02dcS ,\nwhich is the euclidean analog of the considered in the case of Higgs decay quantity (see\nRefs.[6, 12, 56]). In our case it can be defined as\nRD(Q\n2) \u2261 \u2212\n1\n2\nd log D\u02dcS(Q\n2)\nd logQ2\n=\nD\u02dcS(Q\n2)\u2212DS(Q\n2)\n2D\u02dcS(Q2)\n=\n\u03b1s(Q\n2)\n\u03c0\n+O(\u03b12s) (65)\nwhich satisfies a renormalization-group equation(\n\u2202\n\u2202 log\u00b52\n+ \u03b2(\u03b1s)\n\u2202\n\u2202 log\u03b1s\n)\nRD = 0 (66)\nthat is free of the anomalous quark-mass dimension and hence suitable for analysis by the\nmethod of effective charges [57] (see also Ref.[58]), scheme-invariant perturbation theory\n[59], commensurate scale relations [60] and the standard PMS approach [61].\nHere we assemble everything that is known about the MS perturbation series of the\neuclidean constructs (63,64,65).

Table 3 emphatically confirms this expectation at large Nf , where one\nsees that \u2206\u02dc6\/\u2206\u02dc2 \u2248 69 is two orders of magnitude larger than \u22066\/\u22062 \u2248 0.40.\nIn general, one expects that the asymptotic structure of perturbation theory expansions\nwill differ for the physical quantity RS(s) and the euclideanization D\u02dcS(Q\n2). To construct\nthe latter from the former one takes the renormalization-group determined powers of the\nminkowski logarithm log(\u00b52\/w2) and performs the transformation\nlog2k\n(\n\u00b52\nw2\n)\n\u2192 (2k)!\n(\n2\u2212 41\u2212k\n)\n\u03b6(2k) (90)\non even powers. If the imaginary part is fairly well behaved, as at large Nf , it is unlikely\nthat its euclideanization will be so. Indeed, the factorial growth of the r.h.s. of Eq.(90)\nshould restore the factorial growth of the perturbative series for the euclidean quantity D\u02dcS,\nexpected from general grounds of quantum field theory. The large-Nf analysis of Table 3\nsuggests that the imaginary part RS is rather well behaved for n < 7 loops, with the far\nworse behaviour of D\u02dcS (and thus \u2206\u02dcn) resulting from its renormalon at \u03b4 = 1, which was\nsuppressed by the sine function in (53).\nNext we consider the more prudent euclideanization (63), with a perturbation series\nDS(Q\n2) = 3[m(Q2)]2\n(\n1 +\n\u2211\nn>0\ndn\n(\n\u03b1s(Q\n2)\n\u03c0\n)n)\n(91)\ndn = dn \u2212 2\u03b3n\u22121 \u2212\nn\u22121\u2211\nk=1\n(k\u03b2n\u2212k\u22121 + 2\u03b3n\u2212k\u22121)dk (92)\nThe large-Nf results for DS are obtained from\ndn\u22121 = (\u2212Nf\/6)\nn\u22122\n(\nAn +\u2206n +O(1\/Nf)\n)\n(93)\n\u2206n = \u2206\u02dcn \u2212 (n\u2212 2)\u2206\u02dcn\u22121 (94)\nat n > 2 loops, with the \u03b4 = 1 renormalon removed by the combination (94). At 2 loops,\nwe have \u22062 = \u2206\u02dcn \u2212 2 = 16\/3. Table 3 shows that the factorial growth in DS at large Nf\nis milder than in D\u02dcS, but more severe than in the imaginary part RS.\nFrom (65,92) we obtain the first 5 terms in the expansion\nRD(Q\n2) =\n\u2211\nn\u22650\nrn\n(\n\u03b1s(Q\n2)\n\u03c0\n)n+1\n(95)\nr0 = \u03b30 = 1 (96)\n21\nr1 = \u03b31 +\n1\n2\n\u03b20d1 (97)\nr2 = \u03b32 + \u03b20d2 \u2212\n1\n2\n\u03b20d\n2\n1 +\n1\n2\n\u03b21d1 (98)\nr3 = \u03b33 +\n3\n2\n\u03b20d3 +\n1\n2\n\u03b20d\n3\n1 \u2212\n3\n2\n\u03b20d1d2 + \u03b21d2 \u2212\n1\n2\n\u03b21d\n2\n1 +\n1\n2\n\u03b22d1 (99)\nr4 = \u03b34 + 2\u03b20d4 + 2\u03b20d\n2\n1d2 \u2212 2\u03b20d1d3 \u2212\n1\n2\n\u03b20d\n4\n1 \u2212 \u03b20d\n2\n2\n+\n3\n2\n\u03b21d3 +\n1\n2\n\u03b21d\n3\n1 \u2212\n3\n2\n\u03b21d1d2 \u2212\n1\n2\n\u03b22d\n2\n1 + \u03b22d2 +\n1\n2\n\u03b23d1 (100)\nwhere the 5-loop coefficient d4 is unknown, while the estimates for the 5-loop anomalous\nquark mass dimension are known from the results of application of the Pade\u00b4 resummation\nmethod [25] ( note, however, that the analytical calculation of order O(1\/N2f )-corrections\nto \u03b3m(\u03b1s) [51] indicate that the latter ones should be refined). At large Nf we simply\nobtain\nrn = (\u2212Nf\/6)\nn\n(\nn\n2\n\u2206\u02dcn+1 +O(1\/Nf)\n)\n(101)\nfor n > 0, with no contribution from the anomalous quark-mass dimension beyond the\none-loop result r0 = \u03b30 = 1. It follow that at large-Nf the perturbation series for RD\nexplodes as violently as that for D\u02dcS.\n3 Subtleties of the naive nonabelianization\nIn the previous section we mainly concentrated on the analysis of large Nf perturba-\ntive results, for the different theoretical quantities, related to the correlator of quark\nscalar currents. However, as was already explained in Sec.2.7, it is of definite interest to\nstudy the truncated and Borel-resummed perturbative series within the framework of the\nNNA Ansatz, which is postulated by applying the substitution Nf \u2192 Nf \u2212 11Nc\/2=\u22126\u03b20\n(where \u03b20 is the first coefficient of the QCD \u03b2-function, defined by Eq.(1)), supplemented\nby retaining the leading terms in powers of \u03b20 in the reorganized perturbative series. This\nprocedure enables one to transform large-Nf results, which are related to QED (note that\nin QED \u03b20 is proportional to Nf ), to the nonabelian case of QCD.\nIn this section we shall study a number of theoretical issues related to the application\nof the NNA approximation in the scalar channel. In particular, we shall concentrate on\nobtaining estimates of uncalculated higher-order terms in perturbative series for quantities,\nrelated to the correlator of quark scalar currents both in the euclidean and minkowskian\nregions. We shall also formulate different procedures for the resummation of the large\nminkowskian \u03c02-terms, within the framework of the NNA approach.\n3.1 Estimates of the higher order corrections in the MS-scheme.\nWe begin by considering the expressions\ndNNAn = \u03b2\nn\u22121\n0 \u2206\u02dcn+1 (102)\n22\nsNNAn = \u03b2\nn\u22121\n0 \u2206n+1 (103)\nd\nNNA\nn = \u03b2\nn\u22121\n0 \u2206n+1 (104)\nfor the coefficients dn, sn and dn in D\u02dcS, RS and DS at n + 1 loops in the MS-scheme.\nThese are obtained by the naive nonabelianization of the terms in (85,89,93) that do not\ninvolve the large-Nf anomalous quark-mass dimension contribution An, which is known\nto be unamenable to naive nonabelianization in general (for detailed discussions, related\nto the deep-inelastic scattering anomalous dimensions see the works of Ref.[62]), and in\nany case is small at 5 loops, since it falls off like (2\/5)n.\nTable 4 shows that all three NNA estimators give the correct sign and order of magni-\ntude at 3 and 4 loops. At 4 loops, the success of d\nNNA\n3 is rather remarkable, since we are\nusing only the (Nf \u2212 33\/2)\n2 approximation to a quadratic to estimate the full result. In\nparticular, at Nf = 5, as in Higgs decay, d3 differs from the NNA estimate by only 8%.\nIt is significant that this success of NNA occurs in the safer euclideanization DS, which\nincludes neither the \u03c02 terms of RS nor the spurious renormalon of D\u02dcS. Accordingly we\ntake\nd\nNNA\n4 = \u03b2\n3\n0\n(\n17597\n324\n+\n20\n3\n\u03b6(3)\u2212 60\u03b6(5)\n)\n(105)\nas our favoured NNA estimator.\nNote, that even if we choose an overall factor of two as the conservative uncertainty in\nthe estimating power of the NNA procedure (which is motivated by inspecting the related\nnumbers of Table 4 for Nf = 3), we arrive to the conclusion that the 5-loop perturbative\napproximation for DS is really well-behaved. Indeed, taking Nf = 3 and \u03b1s \u2248 0.3 we\nobtain the following series\nDS = 1 + 3.67\n(\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)\n+ 14.17\n(\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)2\n+ 77.36\n(\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)3\n+ 2\u00d7 1.26\n(\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)4\n(106)\n= 1 + 0.350 + 0.129 + 0.067 + 0.0002\nwith a rather small 5-loop term. Thus, the 4-loop extractions of the running mass ms\nof Ref.[9], which is based on the consideration of the DS-function, indeed contains rather\nsmall perturbative QCD uncertainties due to the truncation of the corresponding series at\nthe 4-loop level.\nLet us now turn to the study of the NNA predictions for the coefficients of the pertur-\nbative series for RS in the minkowskian region. As in the case of DS and D\u02dcS-functions,\nthis procedure gives the correct sign and order of magnitude at the 3- and 4-loop levels\n(see Table 4). Taking into account the large Nf -result for \u22065 (see Eq.(57)) we get the\nfollowing NNA prediction for the 5-loop term in RS\nsNNA4 = \u03b2\n3\n0\n(\n64877\n324\n\u2212\n100\n3\n\u03b6(3)\u2212 60\u03b6(5)\u2212\n275\n18\n\u03c02 + 4\u03b6(3)\u03c02 +\n1\n10\n\u03c04\n)\n(107)\nwhich gives small and positive numbers\nsNNA4 (Nf = 3) \u2248 49 ; s\nNNA\n4 (Nf = 4) \u2248 39 ; s\nNNA\n4 (Nf = 5) \u2248 31 (108)\n23\nFollowing now the conservative pattern of fixing the uncertainty of the NNA approximation\nof dn-terms by an overall factor of 2, we present the NNA-inspired estimates of s4-term in\nthe following form: s4 \u2248 2s\nNNA\n4 . Keeping this in mind, we arrive at the following numerical\nestimates of s4 for different numbers of Nf :\ns4(Nf = 3) \u223c 98 ; s4(Nf = 4) \u223c 78 ; s4(Nf = 5) \u223c 62 (109)\nFor Nf = 5 these estimates are quite in accord with the result of applying the [2\/2]\nasymptotic Pade\u00b4-approximation method, namely sAPAP4 (Nf = 5) \u2248 67 [24]. However, for\nNf = 3 the Pade\u00b4 estimate of Ref.[24], namely s\nAPAP\n4 (Nf = 3) \u2248 251, is over 2.6 times\nlarger than the related NNA inspired estimate of Eq.(109).\nNote, that contrary to what was found in the application of the Pade\u00b4-resummation\nmethod to the e+e\u2212 annihilation R-ratio [22], the variant of asymptotic Pade\u00b4 estimates\nused in Ref.[24], which is performed in the minkowskian region directly, does not allow one\nto separate the effects of analytical continuation proportional to \u03c02. In the NNA approach\nthe contributions of the \u03c02-effects leading in \u03b20 are taken into account explicitly and can\nbe resummed to all-orders of perturbation theory. We shall consider this technical problem\nin Sec.3.3. Another observation is that the estimates of Eq.(109) differ in both sign and\norder of magnitude from the ones obtained in Ref.[23] using a variant of the effective-\ncharges procedure [21, 63]. In Sec.3.6 we shall return to more detailed considerations\nof the problems related to the application of the effective charges method in the scalar\nchannel.\nWe conclude this subsection by demonstrating the behaviour of the MS- perturbative\nseries for the physical quantity RS of Eq.(71) in the cases of Nf = 3 and Nf = 5, which\nare relevant to the spectral function of the QCD sum rules and the hadronic decay width\nof the Higgs boson. Taking \u03b1s \u2248 0.3 in the first case and \u03b1s \u2248 0.114 in the latter one we\nhave\nNf = 3 : RS \u223c 1 + 5.667\n(\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)\n+ 31.864\n(\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)2\n+ 89.156\n(\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)3\n+ 98\n(\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)4\n(110)\n= 1 + 0.541 + 0.291 + 0.078 + 0.008\nNf = 5 : RS \u223c 1 + 5.667\n(\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)\n+ 29.147\n(\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)2\n+ 41.758\n(\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)3\n+ 62\n(\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)4\n(111)\n= 1 + 0.206 + 0.0384 + 0.0021 + 0.00014\nOne can see, that in both cases the perturbative series are rather well behaved and that\nthe NNA-inspired estimates of 5-loop terms are over 10 times smaller than the 4-loop ones\nexplicitly calculated in Ref.[1] . In view of this we conclude that the 4-loop phenomenolog-\nical studies, based on the 4-loop series of (110,111) are in rather good shape, and that the\nmanifestation of the asymptotic growth of these perturbative series is postponed. Indeed,\nin accordance with the results of Tables 2,3 this feature can manifest itself starting from\nn = 7 loops. In its turn, this means that in the process of concrete phenomenological\napplications of the perturbative results for RS in the energy region where \u03b1s \u2264 0.3 one\ncan restrict oneself to a consideration of the partial sums of the truncated perturbative\nseries with n \u2264 6 loops, estimating roughly the remaining perturbative uncertainty in the\nMS-scheme by the value of the smallest term taken into account. More detailed numerical\nstudies are performed in Sec. 3.5.\n24\n3.2 Large Nf versus Nc -theoretical motivation for NNA\nIt is interesting to consider the motivation for the NNA approximation from the theoretical\npoint of view. In the vector case the NNA term can be proved to have some very special\nproperties by analyzing the operators that build the leading UV renormalon singularity\n[64, 65]. It is convenient to consider a \u2018planar approximation\u2019 where at each order in the\nNf expansion only terms leading in Nc are retained. In this way one obtains an expansion\nin multinomials of Nf and Nc. So for the Adler-function coefficients in the vector case one\ncan write, after extracting an overall factor of (3\/4)CF [18, 66],\ndn = d\n[n]\nn N\nn\nf + d\n[n\u22121]\nn N\nn\u22121\nf Nc + d\n[n\u22122]\nn N\nn\u22122\nf Nc\n2 + . . .+ d[1]n NfNc\nn\u22121 + d[0]n Nc\nn , (112)\nso that the large-Nf expansion runs from left-to-right, and the large-Nc from right-to-left.\nOne can now formulate two versions of NNA. The standard one is derived by replacing\nNf by (11Nc \u2212 12\u03b20)\/2 to arrive at\ndn = d\n(n)\nn \u03b20\nn + d(n\u22121)n \u03b20\nn\u22121Nc + d\n(n\u22122)\nn \u03b20\nn\u22122Nc\n2 + . . .+ d(1)n \u03b20Nc\nn\u22121 + d(0)n Nc\nn . (113)\nOne can, however , define a \u2018dual NNA\u2019 by replacing Nc by (12\u03b20 + 2Nf )\/11, to obtain\nan expansion in \u03b20 with different coefficients. The standard NNA is exact in the large-Nf\nlimit, and the \u2018dual NNA\u2019 is exact in the large-Nc limit. Of course it is the standard NNA\nthat is of practical use since we have all-orders large-Nf results. If one extracts the NNA\nterm dNNAn of the standard expansion and re-expands it one can obtain an expansion in\nNf and Nc with coefficients d\u02dc\n[n\u2212r]\nn . By construction the leading-Nf term is reproduced, so\nd[n]n = d\u02dc\n[n]\nn , but the sub-leading terms will not be reproduced. Nonetheless by making use\nof the operator analysis of [64] one can show that [65],\nd[n\u2212r]n \u2248d\u02dc\n[n\u2212r]\nn [1 +O(1\/n)] , (114)\nso that for fixed-r and large orders of perturbation theory the re-expansion of the NNA\nterm approximates the sub-leading in Nf terms with asymptotic accuracy O(1\/n). For\nthe dual NNA term one can prove an exactly similar result, where sub-leading in Nc terms\nare reproduced to asymptotic accuracy O(1\/n) on re-expansion of the dual NNA term\n[65]. Such weak asymptotic results about the NNA terms will hold provided that in the\nlarge-Nf , and large-Nc limits the leading UV renormalon asymptotics is controlled by a\nsingle operator contribution. This is the case for the vector Adler function of Eq.(60). In\nplanar approximation there are two relevant four-fermion operators, O+ and O\u2212 of [65],\nbut O\u2212 is scalar after Fierzing and decouples. These operators are defined as [65]\nO\u00b1 = OV \u00b1OA\nOV =\n(\n\u03c8\u03b3\u00b5T\nA\u03c8\n) (\n\u03c8\u03b3\u00b5TA\u03c8\n)\n, OA =\n(\n\u03c8\u03b3\u00b5\u03b35T\nA\u03c8\n) (\n\u03c8\u03b3\u00b5\u03b35T\nA\u03c8\n)\nwhere TA denotes the colour matrices. The remaining four-fermion operator O+ gives\nthe leading asymptotics in the large-Nc limit , and in the large-Nf limit the operator\ncorresponding to the single renormalon chains involved in NNA (O1 of [65]) dominates the\nasymptotics [64]. This operator is defined as [65]\nO1 = (1\/g\n4)\u2202\u03bdF\n\u03bd\u00b5\u2202\u03c1F\u03c1\u00b5 .\n25\nLet us see how these weak asymptotic results work by re-expanding the vector d1,d2,\nexplicitly. We shall denote the dual NNA term by dNNA\u2217n , the MS scheme with \u00b5\n2 = Q2 is\nassumed,\nd1 = \u22120.115Nf + 0.655Nc\ndNNA1 = \u22120.115Nf + 0.643Nc\ndNNA\u22171 = \u22120.119Nf + 0.655Nc , (115)\nand\nd2 = 0.086N\n2\nf \u2212 1.40NfNc + 2.10Nc\n2\ndNNA2 = 0.086N\n2\nf \u2212 0.948NfNc + 2.61Nc\n2\ndNNA\u22172 = 0.069N\n2\nf \u2212 0.763NfNc + 2.10Nc\n2 . (116)\nSo we see that the weak asymptotic property holds, and the two versions of NNA give\nsurprisingly good approximations for the sub-leading in Nf and Nc coefficients, given that\nthis is only supposed to be an asymptotic result.\nNow let us repeat this analysis for the scalar D\u02dcS-function of Eq.(67). We find\nd2 = \u22121.91Nf + 17.19Nc\ndNNA2 = \u22121.91Nf + 10.49Nc\ndNNA\u22172 = \u22123.13Nf + 17.19Nc , (117)\nand\nd3 = 0.93N\n2\nf \u2212 21.25NfNc + 72.08Nc\n2\ndNNA3 = 0.93N\n2\nf \u2212 10.22NfNc + 28.10Nc\n2\ndNNA\u22173 = 2.38N\n2\nf \u2212 26.21NfNc + 72.08Nc\n2 (118)\nSo we see that whilst the dual NNA term works reasonably well, the standard NNA in\nwhich we are interested yields the subleading in Nf coefficients with correct sign, but\nsignificantly reduced accuracy. For the coefficients of more physically-interesting quantity\nRS of Eq.(71), which as we saw from the analysis of Sec.2.8, is perturbatively better\nbehaved, we find\ns2 = \u22121.36Nf + 11.98Nc\nsNNA2 = \u22121.36Nf + 7.47Nc\nsNNA\u22172 = \u22122.18Nf + 11.98Nc , (119)\nand\ns3 = 0.26N\n2\nf \u2212 8.59NfNc + 18.24Nc\n2\nsNNA3 = 0.26N\n2\nf \u2212 2.85NfNc + 7.83Nc\n2\nsNNA\u22173 = 0.60N\n2\nf \u2212 6.63NfNc + 18.24Nc\n2 . (120)\n26\nWe see that, again, the dual NNA term works quite well, but the standard version performs\nless satisfactorily. As in the vector case, this can be understood in terms of the operators\ninvolved [67]. In the scalar case it is the four-fermion operator O+ which previously\ndominated the large-Nc asymptotics which is vector after Fierzing and decouples. The\nremaining four-fermion operator O\u2212 will dominate the large-Nc asymptotics, underwriting\nthe success of the dual NNA. In the large-Nf limit, however, it turns out that O\u2212 and the\none-chain operator in the scalar case are both involved in determining the asymptotics,\nand so standard NNA will not satisfy the weak asymptotic result that sub-leading in Nf\nterms are reproduced. Whilst the special property of NNA which holds for the vector\ncase will not be true for the scalar, the numerical accuracy of the approximation is not\nso bad (see Table 4) despite the less satisfactory performance evident from the results of\nEqs.(117)-(120).\n3.3 Analytic continuation of fractional powers of \u03b1s\nIn this section we shall study the analytical continuation of the euclidean construct D\u02dcS(Q\n2)\nintroduced in (64). This is related to the quantity RS by an analytical continuation to\nthe minkowskian region. The continuation is essentially the same as that involved in the\nvector case for the analytical continuation of the Adler D-function to the QCD R-ratio.\nThe effects of analytical continuation have been much studied [29]-[40] in attempts to\nimprove the convergence of the QCD perturbation series by resumming an infinite subset of\nanalytical continuation terms at each order in perturbation theory. Such resummation may\nbe accomplished conveniently by representing the continuation as a contour integral around\na circle in the complex \u2212Q2 plane (for one of the first discussion of this realization of the\ncontour-improved technique see Ref.[34]). One can then perform the contour integration\nnumerically , at some given order of perturbation theory. In the process one resums an\ninfinite subset of potentially large analytical continuation terms involving powers of \u03c02,\nwhich arise in the running of the coupling around the circular contour. Such an expansion\nis termed \u201ccontour-improved\u201d . For the case of a one-loop coupling an explicit closed-form\nresult can be given for the contour integral. We would like to generalize these results to\nthe present case where the mass anomalous dimension gives rise to fractional powers of\n\u03b1s (recent analogous independent considerations were given in Ref.[43]). Using the NNA\nall-orders results for D\u02dcS and RS we shall then perform various numerical studies on the\nperformance of fixed-order perturbation theory, and its \u201ccontour-improved\u201d version.\nThe analytical continuation between D\u02dc and R of (67) and (71) can be written in the\nform\nRS(w\n2) =\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b pi\n\u2212pi\nd\u03b8 3[m(ei\u03b8w2)]\n2\n(\n1 +\n\u2211\nn>0\ndn\n(\n\u03b1s(e\ni\u03b8w2)\n\u03c0\n)n)\n, (121)\ninvolving a contour integral around a circle in the complex w2 = \u2212Q2 plane, as mentioned\nabove.\nWe can relate the running mass m(Q2) to the renormalization scheme invariant mass\n27\nm\u02c6 as follows (see e.g. [41, 42]):\nm(Q2) = m\u02c6 exp\n[\n\u2212\n\u222b \u03b1s(Q2) \u03b3m(x)\n\u03b2(x)\ndx+\n\u03b30\n\u03b20\nln(2\u03b20)\n]\n, (122)\nwhere the second term in the exponent is the commonly used normalization of the defini-\ntion of the invariant mass m\u02c6. Since we shall be working within the NNA procedure, we\nshall set \u03b3i = 0, (i > 0) and \u03b2i = 0(i > 0). In this approximation one has\n[m(Q2)]\n2\n= m\u02c62(2\u03b20)\n2\u03b30\/\u03b20\n(\n\u03b1s(Q\n2)\n\u03c0\n)2\u03b30\/\u03b20\n. (123)\nInserting this expression for the running mass into (121) one arrives at\nRS(w\n2) = 3m\u02c62(2\u03b20)\n2\u03b30\/\u03b20 1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b pi\n\u2212pi\nd\u03b8\n(\n\u03b1s(e\ni\u03b8w2)\n\u03c0\n)2\u03b30\/\u03b20 (\n1 +\n\u2211\nn>0\ndn\n(\n\u03b1s(e\ni\u03b8w2)\n\u03c0\n)n)\n. (124)\nThe contour-improved expansion is obtained by performing the integration term-by-term.\nFor a one-loop beta-function, appropriate for the NNA approximation, one has\n\u03b1s(e\ni\u03b8w2) =\n\u03b1s(w\n2)\n[1 + i\u03b20\u03b8\u03b1s(w2)\/\u03c0]\n, (125)\nand so dn in the \u201ccontour-improved\u201d NNA expansion will be multiplied by\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b pi\n\u2212pi\nd\u03b8\n[\u03b1s(w\n2)\/\u03c0]\n2\u03b30\/\u03b20+n\n[1 + i\u03b20\u03b8\u03b1s(w2)\/\u03c0]\n2\u03b30\/\u03b20+n\n\u2261\n(\n\u03b1s(w\n2)\n\u03c0\n)2\u03b30\/\u03b20\nAn(\u03b1s(w\n2)) . (126)\nThe function An(\u03b1s) is given in closed form by\nAn(\u03b1s) =\n1\n\u03b20\u03b4n\u03c0\n(\n1 + \u03b220\u03b1\n2\ns\n)\u03b4n\/2(\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)n\u22121\nsin [\u03b4narctan (\u03b20\u03b1s)] , (127)\nwhere \u03b4n\u22611\u2212n\u22122\u03b30\/\u03b20. For \u03b4n \u2192 0 this reproduces the well-known factor (1\/\u03c0\u03b20)arctan(\u03b20\u03b1s)\nobtained by resumming all the analytical continuation terms only involving \u03b20 for the\ne+e\u2212 R-ratio, while for n = 0 the expansion of the r.h.s. of Eq.(127) to first order in\n\u03b1s = \u03c0\/(\u03b20ln(w\n2\/\u039b2)) coincides with the result previously obtained in [4]. Finally we can\nwrite down two expansions for R with NNA,\nRS = 3m\u02c6\n2(2\u03b20)\n2\u03b30\/\u03b20\n(\n\u03b1s(w\n2)\n\u03c0\n)2\u03b30\/\u03b20 (\n1 +\n\u2211\nn>0\nsNNAn\n(\n\u03b1s(w\n2)\n\u03c0\n)n)\n, (128)\nor, alternatively, the \u201ccontour-improved\u201d NNA expansion,\nRS = 3m\u02c6\n2(2\u03b20)\n2\u03b30\/\u03b20\n(\n\u03b1s(Q)\n\u03c0\n)2\u03b30\/\u03b20 (\nANNA0 (\u03b1s(w\n2)) +\n\u2211\nn>0\ndNNAn A\nNNA\nn (\u03b1s(w\n2))\n)\n. (129)\n28\nThe ANNAn for n > 1 are defined from (127) on setting \u03b4n = 1 \u2212 n. For n = 0 one needs\nto be careful. The NNA terms are of the form \u03b2i\u221210 \u03b1\ni\ns, with n = 0 one needs to isolate the\nterms linear in \u03b30 that arise on expanding (127) in powers of \u03b1s. One finds\nANNA0 (\u03b1s) = 1\u2212\n\u03b30\n\u03b20\nln(1 + \u03b20\n2\u03b1s\n2)\u2212\n2\u03b30\n\u03b20\n2\u03b1s\narctan(\u03b20\u03b1s) +\n2\u03b30\n\u03b20\n. (130)\nNote that this term contains all contributions depending on the anomalous dimension \u03b30.\nThe remaining ANNAn for n > 0 are precisely the same as the functions which arise in\nthe case of the e+e\u2212 R-ratio. The n = 1 case corresponds to \u03b4n \u2192 0 and so one has the\nwell-known arctan alluded to earlier,\nANNA1 (\u03b1s) =\n1\n\u03c0\u03b20\narctan(\u03b20\u03b1s) . (131)\nFor n > 1 the ANNAn are in fact simple rational functions of \u03b1s\/\u03c0. One has, for instance,\nANNA2 (\u03b1s) =\n(\u03b1s\/\u03c0)\n2\n1 + \u03b220\u03b1\n2\ns\nANNA3 (\u03b1s) =\n(\u03b1s\/\u03c0)\n3\n(1 + \u03b220\u03b1\n2\ns)\n2\nANNA4 (\u03b1s) =\n((\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)4\n\u2212\n\u03c02\u03b220\n3\n(\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)6)\n\/(1 + \u03b220\u03b1\n2\ns)\n3\n. (132)\n3.4 Scheme dependence of NNA results\nBefore proceeding to some numerical studies we need to confront one further important\nsubtlety. As we have defined them the NNA expansions in (128) and (129) are scheme-\ndependent. Of course, we expect the partial sums to be scheme-dependent. The problem\nis that the all-orders sum for RS will depend on our choice of renormalization scale. Since\nRS is a physical quantity this is clearly undesirable. Following other similar analyses\nfor the vector correlator [36, 66, 69, 70] we will use in the next section a Borel sum of\nthe divergent series to define the all-orders sum, using regulation to cope with the IR\nrenormalon contributions. The all-orders sum so defined can then be compared with\nfixed-order perturbation theory partial sums to obtain an estimate of the likely effect of\nuncalculated higher-order corrections. The problem is that the all-orders (Borel) sum of\nthe series in (128) combined with the fractional power of (\u03b1s\/\u03c0)\n2\u03b30\/\u03b20 depends on the\nrenormalization scale used for \u03b1s. The difficulty is the fractional power of \u03b1s involving\n1\/\u03b20. For illustrative purposes suppose that we used the so-called V -scheme (see e.g.\nRef.[49]) corresponding to MS with \u00b52 = e\u22125\/3w2 rather than \u00b52 = w2. Writing \u03b1Vs and\n\u03b1MSs for the two scale choices, we have, assuming a one-loop beta-function,\uf8eb\uf8ed\u03b1MSs\n\u03c0\n\uf8f6\uf8f82\u03b30\/\u03b20 = (\u03b1Vs\n\u03c0\n)2\u03b30\/\u03b20[\n1 +\n5\n3\n\u03b20\n\u03b1Vs\n\u03c0\n]\u22122\u03b30\/\u03b20\n=\n(\n\u03b1Vs\n\u03c0\n)2\u03b30\/\u03b20 \uf8ee\uf8f01\u2212 10\n3\n\u03b30\n(\n\u03b1Vs\n\u03c0\n)\n+\n2\u03b30\n\u03b20\n(\n2\u03b30\n\u03b20\n+ 1\n)\n25\n18\n\u03b20\n2\n(\n\u03b1Vs\n\u03c0\n)2\n+ . . .\n\uf8f9\uf8fb . (133)\n29\nRecalling that the NNA terms have the structure \u03b2i\u221210 \u03b1\ni\ns it is clear that only the terms\nlinear in \u03b30 in the expansion in the second line, appear in NNA. Thus, since not all terms\ninvolved in the change of scheme are retained, the resummed NNA expansions will be\nscheme-dependent. The resolution of this problem is to avoid powers of \u03b1s involving 1\/\u03b20.\nThis can be accomplished by identifying an effective charge R\u02c6 related to R by [57, 68],\nRS = 3m\u02c6\n2[2\u03b20R\u02c6]\n2\u03b30\/\u03b20\n. (134)\nR\u02c6 will have the perturbative expansion\nR\u02c6 =\n(\n\u03b1s(w\n2)\n\u03c0\n)(\n1 +\n\u2211\nn>0\ns\u02c6n\n(\n\u03b1s(w\n2)\n\u03c0\n)n)\n. (135)\nSince this only involves integer powers of \u03b1s all terms involved in a change of scheme at\nthe one-loop level now contribute to the NNA result, and the resummed NNA expansion\nwill be scheme-independent.\nRS = 3m\u02c6\n2(2\u03b20)\n2\u03b30\/\u03b20\n[(\n\u03b1s(w\n2)\n\u03c0\n)(\n1 +\n\u2211\nn>0\ns\u02c6NNAn\n(\n\u03b1s(w\n2)\n\u03c0\n)n)]2\u03b30\/\u03b20\n, (136)\nis a reformulation of NNA forRS in which the resummed series is scheme-independent. The\nunsatisfactory \u201cscheme-dependent\u201d version in (128) follows from it if only the terms linear\nin \u03b30 are retained in expanding the series in s\u02c6\nNNA\ni . Writing S\n2\u03b30\/\u03b20 = exp[(2\u03b30\/\u03b20)ln(S)]\nand expanding the exp to O(\u03b30) one arrives at\n1 +\n\u2211\nn>0\nsNNAn\n(\n\u03b1s(w\n2)\n\u03c0\n)n\n= 1 +\n2\u03b30\n\u03b20\nln\n[\n1 +\n\u2211\nn>0\ns\u02c6NNAn\n(\n\u03b1s(w\n2)\n\u03c0\n)n]\n, (137)\nwhich relates the two versions of NNA for RS. Using this result one can rewrite the\nreformulated expansion of (136) in terms of the sNNAi , (128) is replaced by,\nRS = 3m\u02c6\n2(2\u03b20)\n2\u03b30\/\u03b20\n(\n\u03b1s(w\n2)\n\u03c0\n)2\u03b30\/\u03b20\nexp\n[\u2211\nn>0\nsNNAn\n(\n\u03b1s(w\n2)\n\u03c0\n)n]\n. (138)\nWe can immediately write a contour-improved version which replaces (129),\nRS = 3m\u02c6\n2(2\u03b20)\n2\u03b30\/\u03b20\n(\n\u03b1s(w\n2)\n\u03c0\n)2\u03b30\/\u03b20\nexp\n[\nANNA0 (\u03b1s(w\n2))\u2212 1 +\n\u2211\nn>0\ndNNAn A\nNNA\nn (\u03b1s(w\n2))\n]\n.\n(139)\nUsing the Borel Sum to resum the series in the exponent in (138) and combining with the\nfractional power of \u03b1s we will now obtain an all-orders result for RS which is independent\nof renormalization scale, as required since RS is a physical quantity.\n30\n3.5 Numerical studies on the convergence of the NNA results\nWe shall now perform some numerical studies on the reformulated NNA expansions of\n(138) and (139). We shall consider the partial sums R\n(n)\nMS\nand R\n(n)\nV obtained by summing\nthe series in the exponent in (138) up to and including the sNNAn term, in the MS and\nV schemes, respectively. The prefactor 3m\u02c62(2\u03b20)\n2\u03b30\/\u03b20 is set to unity. We shall also con-\nsider the analogous partial sums of the contour-improved expansion in (139), R\n(n)CI\nMS\nand\nR\n(n)CI\nV . In Table 5 we begin by displaying the s\nNNA\nn coefficients in the MS scheme, and the\nV -scheme. We assume Nf = 5 active flavours of quarks. We shall use these two schemes\nto illustrate some of the scheme-dependence subtleties discussed in the last Section. In\ncontrast to the \u201cplateau of tranquility\u201d evident in the limited growth of the MS scheme\ncoefficients for n < 7 , which was alluded to in Sec. 2.9, we see that the corresponding\nV -scheme coefficients grow much more rapidly. Alternating sign growth is evident even\nin low orders reflecting the asymptotic alternating factorial growth contributed by the\nleading UV renormalon singularity at \u03b4 = \u22121 contained in the Borel transform G\u2212(\u03b4)\nin (44). In the MS scheme this behaviour is temporarily screened in low orders by the\nexp(5\u03b4\/3) factor in (53), which is absent in the V -scheme. In Table 6 we show the par-\ntial sums for the choice of coupling \u03b1MSs = 0.114, (\u03b1\nV\ns = 0.12895) appropriate for Higgs\nwidth determination (Nf = 5 is assumed). As can be seen convergence is rapid for all\nthe expansions. Of course, this is only temporary since the series is asymptotic, and for\nsufficiently large orders the alternating factorial growth of coefficients due to the leading\nultra-violet renormalon will be evident. The V -scheme leads to slightly faster convergence\nthan MS. We show the sNNAn coefficients in the MS and V -schemes up to n = 10. Further\nnote that for n > 5 the partial sums in the two schemes are in complete agreement to the\nnumber of significant figures quoted, emphasising the scheme-invariance of the resummed\nexpansions in (138) and (139). In Table 7 the partial sums for \u03b1MSs = 0.3, (\u03b1\nV\ns = 0.46736)\nappropriate for the strange quark mass determination are recorded (Nf = 3 is assumed).\nAs one would anticipate the convergence is much less impressive. Further the analytic\ncontinuation terms are much more important at this larger value of the coupling, and the\nagreement of the results in the two schemes, and the apparent convergence is much more\nevident for the contour-improved expansion (139). This fact supports the application of\nthe contour-improved NNLO expansions for the extraction of the s-quark mass value from\nthe Cabibbo suppressed \u03c4 -decay mode directly in the MS-scheme [71] and within a re-\nalization of the effective charges approach [43]. To emphasise the scheme-dependence of\nthe all-orders sum of the \u201cconventional\u201d NNA expansions in (128) and (129) we tabulate\nthe corresponding partial sums in Table 8, for \u03b1MSs = 0.114. The partial sums in the two\nschemes are clearly converging towards two different results, 0.04134 in the MS scheme\nand 0.04039 in the V -scheme. The difference \u22480.001 is of order (\u03b1s\/\u03c0)\n2, as one would\nanticipate from (133).\nWe can compare the partial sums in Tables 6-8 with the all-orders Borel sum of the\nseries based on the Borel transform in (53). IR renormalons require regulation since they\ncontribute singularities on the positive real axis in the Borel plane. In common with\nsimilar numerical studies on the vector correlator [36, 66, 69, 70] we shall take a Cauchy\n31\nPrincipal Value (PV ). In the V -scheme we then have\n\u2211\nn>0\nsNNA,Vn\n(\n\u03b1Vs\n\u03c0\n)n\n\u2261PV\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nd\u03b4 e\u2212\u03b4pi\/(\u03b20\u03b1\nV\ns )\n[\nsin\u03c0\u03b4\n\u03c0\u03b4\n2\n(\nG+(\u03b4) +G\u2212(\u03b4) +\n\u03b30\n\u03b4\n)\n\u2212\n2\u03b30\n\u03b4\n]\n,\n(140)\nwhere the UV and IR renormalon contributions G\u2212(\u03b4) and G+(\u03b4) are given by (44) and\n(45) respectively. Writing the \u2018sin\u2019 as a sum of complex exponentials and using partial\nfractions the separate UV and IR renormalon contributions can be expressed [66] in terms\nof generalized exponential integral functions Ei(n, w), defined for Rew > 0 by\nEi(n, w) =\n\u222b \u221e\n1\ndt\ne\u2212wt\ntn\n. (141)\nOne finds\n\u2211\nn>0\nsNNA,Vn\n(\n\u03b1Vs\n\u03c0\n)n\n= ANNA0 (\u03b1\nV\ns )\u2212 1 + 4A\nNNA\n1 (\u03b1\nV\ns )\n\u2212\n4\n3\u03c0\u03b20\n\u2211\nn>0\n(\u22121)n\nn2\n[\u03c6+(1, n) + \u03c6+(2, n)\u2212 \u03c6\u2212(1, n)\u2212 \u03c6\u2212(2, n)]\n+\n1\n\u03c0\u03b20\n[\n16\n3\n\u03c6\u2212(1, 1)\u2212\n7\n3\n\u03c6\u2212(1, 2) +\n4\n3\n\u03c6\u2212(2, 1)\u2212\n4\n3\n\u03c6\u2212(2, 2)\n]\n, (142)\nwhere \u03c6+ and \u03c6\u2212 are defined by [66]\n\u03c6+(p, q) = e\nqpi\/(\u03b20\u03b1Vs )(\u22121)q Im\n[\nEi\n(\np,\nq\u03c0\n\u03b20\u03b1Vs\n+ i\u03c0\n)]\n\u03c6\u2212(p, q) = e\n\u2212qpi\/(\u03b20\u03b1Vs )(\u22121)q Im\n[\nEi\n(\np,\u2212\nq\u03c0\n\u03b20\u03b1Vs\n\u2212 i\u03c0\n)]\n\u2212\ne\u2212qpi\/(\u03b20\u03b1\nV\ns )(\u22121)q\u03c0\n(p\u2212 1)!\n(\nq\n\u03b20\n)p\u22121\nRe\n\uf8ee\uf8f0( \u03c0\n\u03b1Vs\n+ i\u03c0\u03b20\n)p\u22121\uf8f9\uf8fb . (143)\nIncluding 1000 terms in the sum over \u03c6+ and \u03c6\u2212 in (142) gives a result accurate to five\nsignificant figures. Exponentiating and evaluating R from (138) then yields the values\nindicated \u201cPV \u201d in the last row of Tables 6 and 7. The all-orders Borel sum in (140) is\nscheme-dependent by itself, but on exponentiating it and combining with the factor of\n(\u03b1s\/\u03c0)\n2\u03b30\/\u03b20 in (138) one obtains a scheme-independent result by construction. In the MS\nscheme the Borel transform in (140) has an extra factor e5\u03b4\/3. At the smaller value of the\ncoupling \u03b1MSs = 0.114 in Table 6 one sees that for n > 4 the partial sums are all in good\nagreement with the exponentiated PV Borel result. The partial sums are in fact stable\nto four significant figures up to n\u224840 where violent oscillations due to the leading UV\nrenormalon will be evident. The situation is somewhat less stable at the larger value of\n\u03b1MSs = 0.3 in Table 7, with oscillations due to the leading UV result clearly visible in the\nV -scheme. For n > 4 the MS result is in reasonable agreement with the exponentiated\nPV Borel sum, oscillations become evident for n > 9, the V -scheme results break down\nfor n > 7. The contour-improved expansion results are stable but somewhat smaller\n32\nthan those obtained with the standard perturbative expansion. On the evidence of these\nnumerical comparisons one would anticipate that, even at the larger value of the coupling,\nfixed-order perturbation theory at NNLO (n = 3), the level of exact calculation at present,\nwould give a reasonable approximation. Finally, in Table 8 we give in the last row the PV\nBorel sums in the MS and V schemes. We see that these values are in good agreement\nwith the respective scheme-dependent \u201cconventional NNA\u201d partial sums for n > 4.\n3.6 Effective charges from the scalar correlator\nIn Sec.3.1 we discussed the problem of estimates of the higher-order QCD corrections to\nthe spectral function of QCD sum rules in the scalar channel and to the decay width\nof a Standard Electroweak Model Higgs boson to quark-antiquark pairs within the NNA\napproach. In fact this problem was already analysed a few years ago [23] using a variant\nof the procedure developed in Refs.[21, 63], which is based on application of the effective\ncharges approach of Ref.[57]. Usually this approach is applied to the renormalization\nscheme-dependent expansions of the quantities, which satisfy the renormalization group\nequations without anomalous dimension terms (see e.g. Eq.(66)). However, the quantities\nof Eqs.(67),(71),(91) we are interested in obey the renormalization group equations with\nanomalous mass dimension function (see e.g. Eq.(49)), which arises due to the factor\nof two powers of the running quark mass appearing in the Born approximation of their\nexpansions. The appearance of the anomalous dimension function in the corresponding\nrenormalization group equations reflects the scale-scheme dependence of the running quark\nmass and it generates the additional scheme-dependence of the perturbative series under\ninvestigation (in contrast to the familiar e+e\u2212 annihilation R-ratio, the scheme-dependence\nof RS is starts from the \u03b1s\/\u03c0-term). This additional scheme-dependence is analogous\nto the factorization scale-scheme dependence of the moments of deep-inelastic scattering\nstructure functions (for some related discussions see Sec.3.4). In the process of the effective-\ncharges motivated studies of Ref.[23] the careful treatment of this \u201cfactorization-like\u201d scale-\nscheme ambiguity of the definition of running mass was overlooked. To overcome this\nshortcoming one should define the related effective charges either using the representation\nof Eq.(123) of Sec.3.3 [57, 68] or defining the logarithmic derivative of the quantities under\nconsideration [57].\nIn this section we shall follow the latter prescription and consider the euclidean con-\nstruct RD in (65) which is the unique combination of first and second derivatives of\nthe high-energy scalar correlator that satisfies a renormalization-group equation of the\nform (66) and gives RD = \u03b1s\/\u03c0+O(\u03b1\n2\ns). Thus it provides the simplest way of defining an\neffective coupling\n\u03b1\u02dcs(Q\n2)\n\u03c0\n\u2261 RD(Q\n2) \u2261 \u2212\n1\n2\nd log D\u02dcS(Q\n2)\nd logQ2\n=\n\u2211\nn\u22650\nrn\n(\n\u03b1s(Q\n2)\n\u03c0\n)n+1\n(144)\nin the scalar channel. This leads to an effective beta function\n\u03b2\u02dc(\u03b1\u02dcs(Q)) \u2261\nd logRD(Q\n2)\nd logQ2\n= \u2212\n\u2211\nn\u22650\n\u03b2\u02dcn\n(\n\u03b1\u02dcs(Q\n2)\n\u03c0\n)n+1\n(145)\n33\nwhose coefficients \u03b2\u02dcn are scheme-independent combinations of the coefficients \u03b2n of the\nMS beta function and the coefficients rn of the MS expansion of RD. Clearly \u03b2\u02dcn may differ\nfrom \u03b2n only for n > 1. To simplify the presentation, we define cn \u2261 \u03b2n\/\u03b20. Then for\nn > 1 we have\n\u03b2\u02dcn \u2212 \u03b2n\nn\u2212 1\n= \u03b20(rn \u2212 \u2126n) (146)\nwhere \u2126n is determined by products of elements of {rk, ck | k < n} with weights summing\nto n. In particular\n\u21262 = r1(c1 + r1) (147)\n\u21263 = r1\n(\nc2 \u2212\n1\n2\nc1r1 \u2212 2r\n2\n1 + 3r2\n)\n(148)\n\u21264 = r1\n(\nc3 \u2212\n4\n3\nc2r1 +\n2\n3\nc1r2 +\n14\n3\nr31 \u2212\n28\n3\nr1r2 + 4r3\n)\n+\n1\n3\n(\nc2r2 \u2212 c1r3 + 5r\n2\n2\n)\n(149)\nto 5 loops (see [21, 63]).\nThe estimation method based on this effective charge is r4 \u2248 \u21264. It was motivated by\nthe assumption that in electron-positron annihilation and deep-inelastic scattering sum\nrules such scheme-independent process-dependent effective \u03b2 functions will behave in a\nway that is broadly similar to the MS \u03b2 function, with \u03b2\u02dcn having the same sign and\nmagnitude as \u03b2n at 3 and 4 loops. The calculation of Ref.[13] confirmed this assumption\n(for more detailed comparison of the behaviour of the effective charges \u03b2-functions for\nthese processes with the MS \u03b2-function at the 4-loop level see Ref.[56]).\nNote however that the effective coupling RD(Q\n2) contains the spurious IR renormalon\nat \u03b4 = 1, because it was constructed from the first and second derivatives of the correla-\ntor, with the first requiring UV subtraction for finite m2\/Q2. The only way that massless\nperturbation theory can tell us that we did something that would be illegal in the mas-\nsive theory is to make the massless perturbation explode factorially, leaving an intrinsic\nambiguity of order \u039b2\/Q2 at the point where the sign-constant asymptotic series becomes\nsenseless. We emphasize that this \u039b2\/Q2 effect is profoundly perturbative and should not\nbe confused with suggestions of \u039b2\/Q2 effects beyond those expected from the OPE [72].\nIn our present case we know precisely why D\u02dcS(Q\n2) is sick: the affliction results from per-\nturbative malpractice, in failing to remove UV infinities at finite mass. If one follows the\ngood practice of [42], by taking the second derivative, then the spurious \u03b4 = 1 renormalon\ndisappears.\nIt is therefore instructive to compare the performance of the \u2126 estimator with its\nobvious alternative r4 \u2248 \u21264 based on the effective charge\nRD(Q\n2) \u2261 \u2212\n1\n2\nd logDS(Q\n2)\nd logQ2\n=\n\u2211\nn\u22650\nrn\n(\n\u03b1s(Q\n2)\n\u03c0\n)n+1\n(150)\nwhere rn is obtained by replacing dn in (96)-(100) by dn from (91). This effective charge\nis the unique choice formed from the second and third derivatives of the correlator and is\n34\nhence the simplest that is free from the spurious renormalon. To compute \u2126n exactly one\nmerely replaces rn by rn in (147)\u2013(149).\nIn Tables 9 and 10 we compare the estimators \u2126 and \u2126 with exact results at 3 and 4\nloops. In Table 9 we also give the naive nonabelianizations of rn and \u2126n. Those for rn\nand \u2126n are in Table 10. Here\nrNNAn =\nn\n2\n\u03b2n0 \u2206\u02dcn+1 (151)\nrNNAn =\nn\n2\n\u03b2n0\u2206n+1 (152)\nare obtained by Nf \u2192 Nf \u2212 33\/2 in (101) and its corresponding version for the effective\ncharge RD(Q\n2). The NNA expressions for the estimators \u2126 are\n\u2126NNA2 =\n(\nrNNA1\n)2\n(153)\n\u2126NNA4 = 3r\nNNA\n2 r\nNNA\n1 \u2212 2\n(\nrNNA1\n)3\n\u2126NNA4 = 4r\nNNA\n3 r\nNNA\n1 \u2212\n28\n3\nrNNA2\n(\nrNNA1\n)4\n+\n14\n3\n(\nrNNA1\n)4\n+\n5\n3\n(\nrNNA2\n)2\nor\n\u2126NNA2 =\n1\n4\n\u03b220\u2206\u02dc\n2\n2 (154)\n\u2126NNA3 =\n1\n4\n\u03b230\n(\n6\u2206\u02dc3\u2206\u02dc2 \u2212 \u2206\u02dc\n3\n2\n)\n\u2126NNA4 = \u03b2\n4\n0\n(\n3\u2206\u02dc4\u2206\u02dc2 \u2212\n7\n3\n\u2206\u02dc3\u2206\u02dc\n2\n2 +\n7\n24\n\u2206\u02dc42 +\n5\n3\n\u2206\u02dc23\n)\nwhile the ones for \u2126 can be obtained by rNNAi to r\nNNA\ni in Eqs.(153) or \u2206\u02dcn to \u2206n in\nEqs.(154). For example, the analytical form of the NNA expressions for estimators \u21264 and\n\u21264 read\n\u2126NNA4 = \u03b2\n4\n0\n(\n80\n3\n[\u03b6(3)]2 +\n44\n9\n\u03b6(3) +\n124927\n324\n)\n(155)\n\u2126\nNNA\n4 = \u03b2\n4\n0\n(\n80\n3\n[\u03b6(3)]2 +\n668\n9\n\u03b6(3) +\n33463\n324\n)\n(156)\nThey result from neglect of ck in (149), since ck = O(N\nk\u22121\nf ), at large Nf , while rk and rk\nare O(Nkf ).\nIn Table 9 we present results using the \u2126 estimator. The comparison with exact\nresults at 3 and 4 loops is not so good as in the QCD and QED studies of Refs.[21, 63]\ncorrespondingly. At Nf = 5, for example, we have r2\/\u21262 \u2248 0.702, while r3\/\u21263 \u2248 2.34, so\nthe exact growth factor r3\/r2 is 2.34\/0.702 \u2248 3.33 times that estimated by \u2126. Considering\nthe NNA approximations for rn and \u2126n we get the similar results. Thus effective-charge\nanalysis, based on both \u2126 and \u2126NNA, give the results over factor 3 larger than the growth\nfactor estimated by (151).\n35\nAt Nf = 5, this gives r\nNNA\n2 \/r2 \u2248 0.60 and r\nNNA\n3 \/r3 \u2248 0.59, with an actual growth factor\nr3\/r2 only 2% greater than that indicated at large-\u03b20. This is in accord with the global\npattern of Table 4, which shows that NNA gives a reasonable account of growth from 3 to\n4 loops in all 3 quantities that were considered there. Now we turn attention to the final 3\nrows of Table 9. The values of \u21264 in the final row are exact, since by definition they entail\nonly input from lower orders of perturbation theory. The value of r4 is quite unknown:\nthe \u2126 method takes \u21264 as its estimate. The smaller values of r\nNNA\n4 are simply obtained by\nreplacing Nf by Nf \u2212 33\/2 in the exact large-Nf result for r4. The intermediate values of\n\u2126NNA4 come from (155). The Nf -independent ratio r\nNNA\n4 \/\u2126\nNNA\n4 \u2248 0.46 is a precise measure\nof the uncertainty of the \u2126 estimator at large Nf . The Nf -dependent ratio \u2126\nNNA\n4 \/\u21264 \u2248 0.5\nis a precise measure of the uncertainty of NNA for Nf = 3, 4, 5. These two effects lead to\na factor of 4 difference between the estimators rNNA4 and \u21264, as rival candidates for r4.\nNow we turn to Table 10, where the \u2126 method fails to get the sign right for r3, at 4\nloops. Inspecting the final 3 rows, we see that the \u2126 estimator is 103 times its target at\nlarge Nf . On the other hand, the NNA estimate (152) is very successful. In view of the\nthese failings of \u2126, we proceed only with the \u2126 estimator.\nTo convert a prediction of r4 into one for the 5-loop term s4 in the physically relevant\nimaginary part, we use the known terms in the quartic\nr4 \u2212 \u03b34 \u2212 2\u03b20s4 = 37136.85285\u2212 7810.216455Nf + 575.3282994N\n2\nf\n\u2212 16.32062026N3f + 0.1444281007N\n4\nf (157)\nand parametrize errors in the \u2126 estimator by rn\/\u2126n = 1 + \u03b4n. Then we obtain\ns4 = s\u02dc4 \u2212 \u03b34\/2\u03b20 (158)\ns\u02dc4(Nf = 3) = 472 + 4574\u03b44 (159)\ns\u02dc4(Nf = 4) = 146 + 3529\u03b44 (160)\ns\u02dc4(Nf = 5) = \u2212129 + 2615\u03b44 (161)\nwith central values that are small compared with a realistic estimate of the uncertainty,\nbearing in mind that \u03b42 \u2248 \u22120.3 and \u03b43 \u2248 1.3, at Nf = 5.\nAs an indication of the problem at 3 and 4 loops, we give the 4-loop effective beta\nfunction in terms of a\u02dcs \u2261 RD at Nf = 3, 4, 5:\n\u03b2\u02dc(Nf = 3) = \u22122.250a\u02dcs \u2212 4.000a\u02dc\n2\ns + 58.920a\u02dc\n3\ns \u2212 2148.503a\u02dc\n4\ns (162)\n\u03b2\u02dc(Nf = 4) = \u22122.083a\u02dcs \u2212 3.208a\u02dc\n2\ns + 53.852a\u02dc\n3\ns \u2212 1687.191a\u02dc\n4\ns (163)\n\u03b2\u02dc(Nf = 5) = \u22121.917a\u02dcs \u2212 2.417a\u02dc\n2\ns + 49.356a\u02dc\n3\ns \u2212 1303.490a\u02dc\n4\ns (164)\nwith a sign change at 3 loops as a result of the appearance of a large and positive 3-loop\ncoefficient. This pattern was already observed to occur in the effective beta-function for\nthe minkowskian analog of RD in Ref.[6], where it was considered as an indication of the\nexistence of the spurious perturbative infrared fixed point. Indeed, this zero is compen-\nsated by the 4-loop terms, which remove the spurious fixed point (for the demonstration\nof the existence of a similar feature in the minkowskian region see Ref.[12]).\n36\nThey are however O(50) times larger than those in the MS-scheme beta functions\n\u03b2(Nf = 3) = \u22122.250as \u2212 4.000a\n2\ns \u2212 10.060a\n3\ns \u2212 47.228a\n4\ns (165)\n\u03b2(Nf = 4) = \u22122.083as \u2212 3.208a\n2\ns \u2212 6.349a\n3\ns \u2212 31.387a\n4\ns (166)\n\u03b2(Nf = 5) = \u22121.917as \u2212 2.417a\n3\ns \u2212 2.827a\n3\ns \u2212 18.852a\n4\ns (167)\nwith as \u2261 \u03b1s\/\u03c0.\nFrom this perspective, it is unsurprising that the \u2126 estimator performs less reliably\nat 3 and 4 loops than in the cases considered in Refs.[21, 63]: at 3 loops it is bound to\noverestimate r2, because of the sign change of \u03b2\u02dc2; at 4 loops it is bound to underestimate\nr3, because \u03b2\u02dc3\/\u03b2\nMS\n3 \u2248 50, whereas the procedure assumes that it is O(1).\nWe conclude that the application of \u2126 estimator in the scalar channel allows values\nof the 5-loop coefficient s4 between \u221210\n3 and +103, if the accuracy is no better than\n\u03b44 = 0 \u00b1 0.3, i.e. no better than at 3 loops. If it is no better than at 4 loops, the range\nwidens further, by a factor of about 3.\nThe appearance of large and negative estimates for s4 in Ref.[23], which contradict the\nresults of application of the NNA procedure, described in detail in Sec.3.1, is a reflection of\nthe similar problem encountered in Ref.[23] in a simplified variant of the effective-charges\napproach in the same scalar channel.\n4 Conclusions\nIn this paper we have extended the existing large-Nf analysis of the vector correlator [14]\nto the previously uninvestigated case of the scalar correlator. Because of the absence of\nthe Ward identity Z1 = Z2 present in the vector case, and the inevitable involvement of\nthe quark mass anomalous dimension, the analysis amd combinatorics was considerably\nmore complicated. An all-orders large-Nf result for the anomalous mass dimension \u03b3m was\nobtained in (39,40), and thanks to the remarkable identity (20) relating insertions into two-\nloop skeleton diagrams to the anomalous dimension, it was possible to obtain the all-orders\nlarge-Nf result for the coefficient function of RS in (51)-(53). As in the vector case the\nBorel transform of (44) and (45) contained UV and IR renormalons. A new feature of the\nscalar analysis was the presence of a leading IR renormalon at \u03b4 = 1 in (45). This is not\npresent in the physical quantity RS thanks to the analytical continuation factor sin(\u03c0\u03b4)\/\u03c0\u03b4\nin (53), and the leading singularity is the UV renormalon at \u03b4 = \u22121. It is, however, present\nin the quantity D\u02dcS(Q\n2) of (64), which would correspond to the obvious generalization of\nthe vector Adler function , related by a singly subtracted dispersion relation to the scalar\nvacuum polarization \u03a0S. The presence of this leading IR renormalon is connected with\nthe fact that the undetermined constant \u03a0S(0) in \u03a0S is infinite, a circumstance which did\nnot occur in the vector case thanks to the Z1 = Z2 Ward identity. A more satisfactory\nchoice for the scalar Adler function is therefore the twice subtracted construct DS defined\nin (63). An initial survey of the growth of the coefficients Sn in (50) was given in Table\n2, where it is seen that in the MS scheme for n < 7 there is rather stable behaviour,\nwith rapid growth corresponding to the leading UV renormalon evident for n > 7. The\n37\nperturbation series for DS,D\u02dcS and its logarithmic derivative RD are studied in Sec. 2.10.\nIn Sec.3 we moved to a study of so-called \u201cnaive non-abelianization\u201d (NNA) , where Nf\nin the large-Nf result is replaced by Nf \u2212 11Nc\/2 = \u22126\u03b20, and the pieces of perturbative\ncoefficients containing the leading power of \u03b20 are resummed to all-orders. For the quanti-\nties DS,D\u02dcS and RS the use of NNA to estimate the known three and four-loop coefficients\nwas found to give the correct sign and order of magnitude. Moreover, the NNA-inspired\nestimates predict that at the five-loop level the numerical values of the corresponding co-\nefficients are positive and not very large. In the case of the imaginary part of the scalar\ncorrelator, related to the Higgs boson decay width to quark-antiquark pairs, and to the\nQCD Sum Rules spectral functions, we have sNNA4 (Nf = 3) \u2248 49, s\nNNA\n4 (Nf = 4) \u2248 39,\nsNNA4 (Nf = 5) \u2248 31. Using the conservative estimate of an overall factor of two for the\nuncertainty of the NNA estimates in the scalar channel (suggested by careful comparison\nof the three and four-loop NNA estimates to the results of explicit calculation, see Table 4)\nwe conclude that the NNA-inspired estimate s4 \u2248 2s\nNNA\n4 gives us the following numbers\ns4(Nf = 3) \u223c 98, s4(Nf = 4) \u223c 78, s4(Nf = 5) \u223c 62. For Nf = 5 our estimate is in good\nagreement with the result of previous studies, based on application of the [2\/2] asymptotic\nPade\u00b4 estimation technique [24]. However, for Nf = 3 the method of Ref.[24] agrees with\nour estimates only in sign and is over 2.6 times larger than the estimates proposed by\nus. In Sec. 3.2 we noted that for the vector correlator the NNA term does have some\nspecial properties, deriving from an analysis of the operators that build the leading UV\nrenormalon singularity. On re-expansion it reproduces the sub-leading in Nf contributions\nto asymptotic accuracy O(1\/n) in nth order perturbation theory. A similar result holds\nfor a \u201cdual-NNA\u201d , exact in the large-Nc limit. For the scalar case a corresponding weak\nasymptotic result was not expected to hold, but the \u201cdual NNA\u201d term should still provide\na good approximation. In Sec. 3.3 we considered the analytical continuation from D\u02dcS\nto RS . We recast the running mass m(Q\n2) in terms of the RG-invariant mass m\u02c6 . The\nanalytical continuation was similar to the much studied Euclidean to Minkowskian contin-\nuation for the e+e\u2212 R-ratio [29-40]. The presence of an anomalous dimension complicated\nthe analysis slightly. We arrived at the \u201ccontour-improved\u201d expansion for RS in (129), in\nwhich a subset of analytical continuation terms involving \u03c02 are resummed to all-orders,\nat each order of the expansion. A further subtlety due to the presence of an \u03b1s\n2\u03b30\/\u03b20 term\ninvolving the anomalous dimension, was that the straightforward NNA expansions in (128)\nand (129) have all-orders sums which are RS-dependent. We showed how this could be\nremedied in Sec. 3.4 , and obtained the reformulated expansions in (138) and (139) whose\nall-orders sums were scheme-independent. In 3.5 we performed comparisons of fixed-order\nperturbation theory with the all-orders sum defined using a Cauchy principal value of the\nBorel sum, based on the Borel transform of (44),(45),(Tables 6-8). Two values of the\ncoupling, \u03b1MSs = 0.114 and \u03b1\nMS\ns = 0.3, appropriate for the calculation of the Higgs decay\nwidth to a quark-antiquark pair, and for the strange quark mass determination from QCD\nSum Rules, respectively, were considered. The MS scheme and V -scheme were used to\nillustrate the scheme-dependence issue. Even at the larger value of the coupling it seemed\nthat satisfactory accuracy was achieved at order n = 3, the highest order at which exact\ncalculations are so far available. However, from the analysis of Ref.[73] one can conclude\nthat the uncertainties of the existing ms extractions from the QCD sum rules for the\nscalar correlator might be underestimated. In view of our analysis we conclude, that these\n38\npossible additional uncertainties are not coming from the uncalculated 5-loop perturbative\nQCD contributions, but are mainly related to the uncertainty of the experimental model\nfor the spectral function of the QCD sum rules in the scalar channel.\nIn overall conclusion we have provided a framework for extending the numerous pub-\nlished investigations of higher-order perturbative behaviour, analytical continuation, ap-\nproximate all-orders resummation, and estimates of higher-order corrections, for the vector\ncorrelator and its derived quantities, to the much less studied case of the scalar correlator.\nWe hope that our results may be of use in further phenomenological investigations.\n5 Note Added in Proof\nAfter this work was submitted for publication we were informed that the 3-loop corrections\nto the correlator of scalar currents have been calculated up to (m2\/Q2)4-terms [74]. The\napplication of Pade\u00b4 resummation technique [75, 76] allowed the authors of Ref.[77] to\nspecify the excat mass-dependence of the scalar-scalar correlator at 3-loops in a semi-\nanalytical way. The analytical mass dependence of the 3-loop double-bubble contribution\nto the scalar correlator was studied in Ref.[78]. It should be stressed, however, that none\nof these calculations affect the results reported in this our work.\nAnother, more closely related investigation, was performed in Ref.[79], where the effects\nof the UV-renormalons to the IR-safe Adler function of Eq.(63) of the scalar correlator\nwere studied both in the 1-renormalon and 2-renormalon chain approximations. However,\nthis analysis was based not on the exact calculations of the renormalon chain diagrams in\nthe large Nf -limit, but on the latge Nc-analysis of the contributing 4-fermion operators.\nMoreover, in Ref.[79] the analysis of the IR renormalon contributions was not considered.\nIn view of these differencies, it would be of interest to compare our results with those of\nRef.[79] in more detail.\n6 Acknowledgements\nWe would like to thank A.
