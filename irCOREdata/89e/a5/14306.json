A comparison of student and\ntutor online time across three distance-learning\ncourses\nTina Wilson* and Denise Whitelock**\n*Centre for Educational Software, Open University\n**lnstitute of Educational Technology, Open University\nDistance-learning course providers world-wide are looking to new technology to enhance their course\npresentations. One of the areas they are beginning to assess is that of integrating Computer Mediated\nCommunication (CMC) into their courses. An important factor to be borne in mind with the adoption\nof CMC is the amount of time required to be an active participant. It is important therefore to\ninvestigate how much time tutors and students spend online, and if this is sustainable in the longer term.\nThis paper discusses tutor and student involvement in the Open University M205 - STILE project, and\ncompares these findings with the time spent online by students and tutors on two other Open University\ncourses. Our aim was to see if our findings were atypical. The comparisons are discussed, and\nrecommendations are made about how future online courses can benefit from the findings of this study.\nIntroduction\nComputer Mediated Communication (CMC) is a useful pedagogical tool. Mason (1989a)\nstates that it has proved to be 'a life-line to help, information, contact and exchange' for\nstudents. Thomas (1989) discusses the benefits of CMC from the tutor and course team\nperspectives. However, Rumble (1989) discusses the difficulties of costing the introduction\nof CMC into a course. If more and more distance-learning institutions are going to adopt\nthis medium, it is important to evaluate for all concerned the time required for this type of\nparticipation.\nProjects which have monitored the time requirement for online working by students and\ntutors are essential to inform this debate. STILE (Students' and Teachers' Integrated\nLearning Environment) is one such project which was undertaken at four universities in the\nUnited Kingdom. The Open University's implementation of the project, called M205 -\nSTILE, used a CMC environment, in addition to the World Wide Web (see Wilson and\nWhitelock, 1997a and b; for more information on the M205 STILE environment, see\nWilson and Whitelock, 1996 and 1997c), with 110 students and nine tutors, nation-wide\n25\nTina Wilson and Denise Whitelock Student and tutor online time comparison across three distance-learning courses\nand in Europe. The participants were online for a period of nine months in 1995. This\npaper reports on patterns of usage in the M205 - STILE CMC environment with respect\nto the nature of student-tutor interactions and time spent online. In a further analysis of\nthese findings, a comparison is made with two other Open University courses, in order to\nascertain whether our findings are atypical. This paper thus presents a range of empirical\nfindings which address:\n\u2022 how much time students spent online;\n\u2022 how much time tutors spent online;\n\u2022 this compared with two other courses which also used CMC.\nResults\nThe students at the Open University were taking the Fundamentals of Computing (M205)\ncourse which catered for both technical and non-technical students. At the start of 1995,\n110 students successfully logged into the M205 - STILE environment.\nTime spent online by the students\nAt the end of the course, we were interested to know how long individuals had actually\nspent online, especially as they did not have an offline reader available to them in 1995. As\na group, the M205 - STILE students spent a total of 934 hours online. As an average, each\nstudent spent 8.5 hours online, but the amount of time spent online varied quite consider-\nably between students. Some 15 per cent spent less than two hours online, approximately\nhalf spent less than six hours online, and a small minority (5 per cent) spent more than 24\nhours online (see Figure 1). \u2022\nFigure I: Time spent online by students\nAs approximately half of the students spent less than six hours online over a nine-month\nperiod, it is not surprising that they did not have sufficient time to read messages, and to\npost messages to ask for help in the different conferences (for information about when the\nstudents were available on a month-by-month basis, see Wilson and Whitelock, 1997d).\nThe figures are interesting in themselves, but may well show a disappointing result with\nrespect to usage of this expensive learning aid. Therefore, to understand if our group of\nstudents displayed an atypical amount of time online, we compared our data with other\ncourses which had used online conferencing (see Table 1). Both DT200, 'Introduction to\n26\nALT-} Volume 6 Number I\nInformation Technology' and B885, 'The Challenge of the External Environment', used\nconferencing. Although they used a different conferencing system, they, like the M205 -\nSTILE students, did not have an offline reader. Their participation in the online presenta-\ntion was largely optional (as was the case with M205-STILE), but both DT200 in 1989 and\nB885 in 1992 awarded marks for online use of the conferencing system. On DT200 Mason\n(1989) mentions that '10 per cent of the marks on one assignment were given for\nconference and mail entries'. On B885 Pearson and Mason (1992), mention that 'marks\nwere awarded for both team (group) and individual use of computer conferencing in TMA\n02'. M205 - STILE's use of FirstClass was optional and marks could not be awarded for\nonline use because the 110 students involved could have been seen as having an advantage\nwhen compared with the other 3,000 or more students taking the usual presentation of the\ncourse.\nIf we compare the time spent online by M205-STILE students and DT200 students with\nB885 we find a marked difference in the number of students who did not spend any time\nonline. All of the M205 students went online, approximately 90 per cent of the DT200\nstudents participated but only 67 per cent of the B885 students actually went online. One\nreason for this could be that B885 was a postgraduate course and these students did not\nfeel as much need for this facility. Looking at the 1-2 hour period it is interesting that twice\nas many M205-STILE students used the online facilities when compared with the DT200\nstudents. However the 2-3 hour range has fairly similar percentages of students using the\nonline environment across all three courses.\nHours\nNone\nUp to 1 hour\n1-2 hours\n2-3 hours\n3-5 hours\n5-10 hours\n10-20 hours\n20-30 hours\n30-40 hours\nOver 40 hours\nDT200 '88 *\n% students\n8.4\n5.3\n7\n9.1\n15.6\n27.9\n19\n4.3\n1.8\n1.4\nDT200 '89 *\n% students\nII\n5.6\n7.1\n8\n17.4\n33.1\n13.8\n2.8\n0.6\n0.6\nB885 '92 * *\n% students\n32.8\n13\nII.1\n8.3\n9.8\n15.4\n6.7\n2.2\n0.7\n0\nM205 - STILE '95\n% students\n0\n4.5\n14.5\n10\n15.4\n29.1\n21\n0.9\n0.9\n3.6\n\u2022Mason (1989a and b) converted to percentages.\n**Pearson and Mason (1992).\nTable I: A comparison of time spent online by students on other courses with M205 - STILE\nIf we look at the time range 5-10 hours across all three courses, we see that this range has\nthe highest percentage of students using the online facilities in each case. This suggests that\nthe 5-10 hour period could be the amount of time which students on all three courses\nwould agree is necessary for optional participation in a CMC. However, if we group the\n5-10 and 10-20 time ranges together, we achieve a markedly different result. These time\n27\nTina Wilson and Denise Wh\/te\/ock Student and tutor online time comparison across three distance-learning courses\nranges taken together account for 47 per cent of the students studying DT200, and 50 per\ncent of the M205 - STILE students, but only 22 per cent of the B885 students. This\nsuggests that undergraduate students may elect to spend between 5 and 20 hours online,\nwhile postgraduate students might elect for only 5 to 10 hours. Our findings complement\nthose of Mason (1989a and b) for DT200 in most time ranges. However, the higher\npercentage of students who used M205 - STILE for over 40 hours could be an indication\nthat these students found the environment very motivating.\nTime spent online by the tutors\nAt a meeting before the project started, the tutors taking part in M205 - STILE were\nadvised to spend on average one hour per week, over 30 weeks, on the online part of the\npresentation. This was to include necessary work offline, for example checking program\ncode, looking up a query or responding to points raised. It was stressed that it was likely\nthat they would probably need to spend more time online at the beginning of the course\nwhile the students were becoming acquainted with the new medium. The tutors collectively\nspent a total of 192 hours online. This averages out to 21 hours per tutor, so the ratio of\ntutor-time to student-time was approximately three to one. These metrics require further\ninvestigation on other courses, but if tutors continue to use the environment on average\nthree times as much as the students, we must ask if this is sustainable in terms of staff\ncosts. Strategies need to be developed to improve the ratio of tutor-to-student online time.\nAs with the students, however, the amount of time spent online by the tutors varied quite\nconsiderably, here with a minimum of 12 hours and a maximum of 43 (see Figure 2).\nfigure 2: Time spent online by tutors\nAgain, these figures are interesting in themselves, but to understand if our tutors spent an\natypical amount of time online, we once more compared our data with DT200 and B885\nwhich had used online conferencing (see Table 2). Unfortunately because of the different\ntime ranges used by Mason (1989) and Pearson and Mason (1992), we could only make a\ncomparison between quite broad time bands. On the DT200 course the tutors were advised\nto spend 8 hours of tutorial time in the online part of the presentation. It was not clear if\nthe B885 tutors were guided about how long to spend online. It's interesting however that\nthe majority of tutors on DT200 and B885 were online for more than 3 hours but less than\n20 hours while the M205 - STILE tutors were equally split between the time bands of 3-20\nhours and 20-30 hours. This contrasts with a high percentage of B885 tutors, some 28.14\nper cent who spent less than 3 hours online.\n28\nALT-J Volume 6 Number I\nHours\nDT200 '88 *\n% tutors\nDT200 '89 *\n% tutors\nB885 '92 * *\n% tutors\nM205 - STILE '95\n% tutors\nUp to 3 hours\n3-20 hours\n20-30 hours\nOver 30 hours\n1.5\n66.2\n9.2\n23.1\n3.2\n74.3\n11.3\n11.3\n28.14\n56.25\n3.13\n12.5\n0\n44.44\n44.44\n11.11\n*Mason (1989b), converted to percentages.\n**Pearson and Mason (1992).\nTable 2: A comparison of time spent online by tutors on other courses with M205 - STILE\nIn 1988, 23.1 per cent of the DT200 tutors spent more than 30 hours online. In 1989 this\ndropped by half, suggesting that in the first year of presentation tutors perceived a need to\nbe available online more often. The fact that 44.4 per cent of the M205 - STILE tutors\nwere online for over 20 hours but under 30 hours in 1995 might be explained by the initial\nexpectation that they would be online for one hour for each of the 30 weeks of the course.\nThis might also explain why only 11.1 per cent of the M205 - STILE tutors were online for\nover 30 hours. The DT200 tutors, by contrast, had been expected to spend eight hours in\ntotal online over the 30-week period. Although we cannot look at the eight-hour break\npoint, we can see in the bands 20-30 and over 30 hours that some tutors found it hard to\nkeep to this restriction.\nConclusions\nLevels of student participation on M205 - STILE were fairly typical of an undergraduate\ncourse. However, a higher percentage of students used the system for more than 40 hours.\nIt will therefore be necessary to devise ways of working online and offline to save on\ntelephone costs and time for these students. When we compare the online time across the\nthree courses, the figures suggest that students feel it necessary to spend between 5 and 10\nhours online for optional participation. But a high percentage of undergraduate students\ntaking DT200 and M205 - STILE felt it was necessary to spend between 10 and 20 hours\nonline. Although the award of marks for online participation was introduced to DT200 for\nthe second presentation of the course in 1989, the amount of time spent online was not\nsignificantly different from that of 1988. When we look at the time spent online by the\nDT200 students in 1989 and the B885 students in 1992, when both courses were awarding\nmarks for participation, and compare these with M205 - STILE (where no marks were\nawarded), it is interesting that the M205 - STILE students as a group actually spent more\ntime online. This suggests that the M205 - STILE students found the online environment\nvaluable even though they were not awarded marks for participation.\nCMC raises expectations where students anticipate an immediate response from their\ntutors because they are used to the immediacy of the telephone and other methods of\nengagement. In M205 - STILE, tutor participation was high with 44.4 per cent spending\nbetween 20 and 30 hours online, thus on average at a 3:1 ratio when compared with the\nstudents' average online time. This ratio cannot be sustained, and strategies need to be\n29\nTina Wilson and Denise Whitelock Student and tutor online time comparison across three distance-learning courses\ndeveloped to improve it: further investigation is required into how mpch time tutors need\nto spend in online activities.\nAlthough the tutors were available, some students still perceived that their tutor was not\navailable enough or when they wanted them to be. One student commented that tutors\nseemed to log on only once or twice a week and usually at the weekends. This suggests that\nstudent perceptions and expectations of an instant response is higher in an electronic\nenvironment. Indeed Rumble (1989) alludes to the necessity of 'change and new practices\nhaving to be adopted'. Perhaps the tutors should be asked what they think is a reasonable\namount of online time in order for them to facilitate learning. However, it must be borne in\nmind that if they are being paid on an hourly basis for this activity, this could influence\ntheir response.\nPerhaps the amount of time spent online by tutors could be dramatically reduced if the\ntutors developed a method for online working and built up a database of answers to\nfrequently asked questions. The introduction of an offline reader may also reduce the\namount of time spent online, but not necessarily the amount of time answering queries.\nThe number of tutors on DT200 who spent more than 30 hours online dropped by half in\nthe second year of presentation, suggesting that tutors were more used to using the\nmedium in the second year. Again, further research is required with new courses which\nadopt CMC to see if the tutors are learning how to use the medium in the first year of\npresentation, and if the time spent online is dramatically reduced as a result in the second\nyear. In addition, guidelines are required for how much time tutors should spend online. It\nshould be suggested to the tutors that they inform the students about what the latter can\nreasonably expect; that is, how quickly students can expect a response, and how often they\nthemselves will be online each week. Then the students can gauge when it will be beneficial\nto post messages online. The comparisons across the three courses suggest that tutors\nperhaps need to be online for more than eight hours but not as many as 30 hours. A more\nsuitable length of time would perhaps be 15 hours. This would almost double the suggested\nDT200 online time, but half that of M205 - STILE. \u2022\nAckn owl edgem ents\nWe thank the nine tutors involved in M205 - STILE.
