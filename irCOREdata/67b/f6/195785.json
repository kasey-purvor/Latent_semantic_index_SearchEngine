Provan\n(gp3@ion.le.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nOver the years much attention has been paid to the process\nof magnetic reconnection occurring at the dayside magne-\ntopause during intervals of southward interplanetary mag-\nnetic field (IMF), leading to a greatly enhanced understand-\ning of this process and of the pulsed flux transfer events\n(FTEs) that are observed during such intervals. The first ob-\nservations of impulsive dayside reconnection were made us-\ning space instruments (Haerendel et al., 1978; Russell and\nElphic, 1978, 1979). More recently large instrumental ad-\nvances have resulted in detailed studies of the ionospheric\nresponse to dayside reconnection (e.g. Sandholt et al., 1989;\nLockwood et al., 1990; Elphic et al., 1990), with the near\nglobal coverage of the SuperDARN chain of HF radars mak-\ning these instruments ideal for studying the large-scale iono-\nspheric response (Pinnock et al., 1995; Provan et al.,1998;\nMcWilliams et al., 2000).\nCurrently the process of dayside reconnection during in-\ntervals of Northward IMF is a \u201chot topic\u201d of discussion.\nFor example, Frey et al. (2003), presented two case studies\nof magnetic reconnection during northward IMF. Their ob-\nservations were consistent with reconnection at the Earth\u2019s\nhigh-latitude magnetopause being driven directly by the so-\nlar wind, and remaining continuous and even quasi-steady\nover a period of time. On the other hand, Sandholt et\nal. (2000) reported bursts of reverse convection and a step-\nwise poleward motion of radar backscatter during an inter-\nval containing a rapid northward turning of the IMF. It is\nnow over forty years since Dungey (1963) first postulated\nthat dayside reconnection could occur during intervals of\nnorthward IMF at very high-latitude field lines tailward of\nthe cusp. Dungey\u2019s (1963) ideas were later described by\nCowley (1981, 1983), who presented a pictorial catalogue of\nphysically possible magnetic topologies for lobe reconnec-\ntion during Northward IMF. Cowley\u2019s (1981, 1983) picto-\nrial catalogue is presented here in Fig. 1, and has previously\nbeen discussed by Crooker (1992). Dungey\u2019s (1963) model\nof lobe reconnection is presented in Fig. 1a. Dungey (1963)\ndiscussed a totally closed magnetosphere, with one mag-\nnetosheath field line reconnecting with the same closed\n1208 G.

Cowley\u2019s (1981, 1983) pictorial presentation of five different physically possible topologies for lobe reconnection during Northward\nIMF.\nmagnetospheric field line in both the Northern and Southern\nHemisphere. The result is the transfer of closed nightside\nflux to closed dayside flux, with the newly-created magneto-\nspheric field lines on the dayside first being pulled sunwards,\ndue to the magnetic tension of the newly reconnected field\nlines, before being swept anti-sunward towards the dawn and\ndusk flanks with the magnetosheath flow. These two oppos-\ning forces would result in two reverse-convection cells being\ncreated in each hemisphere, with sunward flow over the polar\ncap and anti-sunward flow at lower latitude. This sense of ro-\ntation is opposite to the direction of rotation of high-latitude\nflows observed under southward IMF conditions.\nFigure 1b presents Russell\u2019s (1972) suggestion that day-\nside reconnection during intervals of northward IMF could\noccur with open field lines in one lobe only, particularly in\nthe presence of an east-west component of the IMF, result-\ning in the reconfiguration of open magnetic field lines. This\nmerging would also be accompanied by reverse convection,\nwhich is decoupled in the two hemispheres. The convection\ncells created due to lobe merging are typically referred to as\nlobe cells. Lobe cells are located wholly on open field lines\nwith flux merely being circulated within the polar cap (Burch\net al., 1985; Reiff and Burch, 1985).\nIn Fig. 1c high-latitude lobe merging occurs in only one\nhemisphere, as also presented in Fig. 1b. But this time the\nmagnetosphere is closed, not open. Thus the effect of the re-\nconnection is to add open flux to the dayside magnetosphere,\nand the polar-cap should expand. In Fig. 1d Cowley (1981,\n1983) describes magnetic reconnection occurring simultane-\nously in both hemispheres (as also suggested in Fig. 1a).\nHowever, this time the magnetosphere is open, and the re-\nconnection occurs on open lobe field lines. The net result\nis to transfer open lobe flux into closed dayside flux, result-\ning in a shrinking of the polar cap. The nightside polar-cap\nboundary moves northward with the reverse-cell flow.\nFinally, Fig. 1e presents Cowley\u2019s (1983) representation\nof sequential merging in the Northern and Southern Hemi-\nspheres. Lobe reconnection first occurs in the Northern\nHemisphere, forming an open field line that drapes over the\ndayside and one that connects to the Southern Hemisphere.\nLater, the overdraped field line merges with one of the previ-\nously opened field lines in the Southern Hemisphere, forming\na closed dayside field line and a completely detached field\nline. Similar sequential merging can also occur in the case of\nopen field lines in the tail, though this is not illustrated in the\nfigure.\nFirst observations of reverse convection were made by\nMaezewa (1976) who interpreted ground magnetometer sig-\nnatures in terms of lobe convection. Later, the existence of\nhigh-latitude \u201clobe\u201d reconnection has been verified by in-situ\nspacecraft observations (Gosling et al., 1991; Kessel et al.,\n1996). Gosling et al. (1991) reported that during an inter-\nval when the IMF Bz component was slightly negative and\n|By |\u001d|Bz|, mixed populations of accelerated magnetosheath\nand magnetospheric plasma were observed close to the mag-\nnetopause boundary, while Kessel et al. (1996) observed sun-\nward flowing protons during reconnection at the high-latitude\nmagnetopause (75\u25e6) when the IMF was directed northward.\nLow-altitude and ground-based observations illustrate that\n\u201cfour cell\u201d convection is typical under northward IMF con-\nditions. The two highest latitude cells are reverse convec-\ntion cells with sunward flow over the polar cap. At lower\nlatitude two \u201cstandard\u201d convection cells are observed, in\nwhich the flow rotates in the same direction as ionospheric\nG. Provan et al.: Pulsed flows observed during an interval of prolonged northward IMF 1209\ncells observed under southward IMF conditions, with anti-\nsunward flow at high latitude and sunward flow at lower lat-\nitude. These two lower-latitude cells are often attributed to\nviscous processes at the magnetopause boundary at lower lat-\nitudes (Burke et al., 1979; Potemra et al., 1984; Freeman et\nal., 1993).\nCrooker et al. (1979) stated that for lobe reconnection to\noccur the northward IMF needs to be near anti-parallel to the\ngeomagnetic field of the tail lobes. The tilt of the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic dipole and the IMF conditions will at times mean\nthat lobe reconnection will be more likely to occur in one\nhemisphere than the other. The seasonal tilt of the magnetic\ndipole, as well as the relative magnitude and orientation of\nthe IMF By and Bx components, will determine which hemi-\nsphere is favoured. Cowley (1983) stated that if the IMF is\npointed antisunward (IMF Bx<0) the Northern Hemisphere\nis favoured over the southern as a site of reconnection, as\nthe IMF is anti-parallel to the geomagnetic field there. It\nwas suggested that the reconnection in the unfavoured hemi-\nsphere may eventually be activated at a later stage, involv-\ning the overdraped magnetic flux resulting from reconnec-\ntion in the favoured hemisphere (as in Fig. 1e). Crooker\nand Rich (1993) showed that lobe reconnection was much\nmore likely to occur in the summer hemisphere. Lockwood\nand Moen (1999) illustrated that a large IMF Bx compo-\nnent can alter the effective dipole tilt of the magnetosphere\nwith respect to the IMF, and hence, alter the favoured hemi-\nsphere for reconnection. \u00d8stgaard et al. (2003) observed two\nexamples of non- conjugate theta auroras, suggesting that\nthe pointing direction of the IMF Bx component resulted in\nlobe reconnection being favoured in one hemisphere over the\nother.\nThe relative magnitude of the IMF By component com-\npared to the IMF Bz component will also alter the reconnec-\ntion process. For example, Cumnock et al. (1992), Freeman\net al. (1993), and Knipp et al. (1993) showed that low-latitude\nreconnection could still occur during intervals of Northward\nIMF if the IMF By component was larger than the IMF Bz\ncomponent, so that the magnetic shear at the low-latitude\nmagnetopause was sufficient for reconnection to start there.\nKnipp et al. (1993) and Ruohoniemi and Greenwald (1996)\nreported a progression of the convection form from a dis-\ntorted two-cell pattern to a multi-cell pattern with increasing\nIMF Bz positive.\nHigh-latitude rapid velocity transients are commonly ob-\nserved in the l-o-s velocity measurements detected by HF\nradars. Poleward-moving regions of antisunward flow mea-\nsured by HF radar, suggested to be associated with FTEs,\nhave been studied at high-time resolution by Pinnock et\nal. (1995) and Rodger and Pinnock (1997). Provan et\nal. (1998) employed data from the CUTLASS Finland radar\nto perform a detailed study of the dynamics and extent of\npulsed ionospheric flows (PIFs). These antisunward-moving\ntransient features were identified as the ionospheric signa-\ntures of impulsive dayside reconnection i.e. the signature of\nmagnetopause flux transfer events (FTEs) (Russell and El-\nphic, 1978, 1979). Such impulsive reconnection is believed\nto be the primary mechanism for the transfer of flux from\nthe Earth\u2019s magnetosheath to the magnetosphere (e.g. Milan\net al., 2000), and occur generally during intervals of low-\nlatitude merging when the IMF is directed southwards (e.g.\nRijnbeek et al., 1984). However, a recent statistical study by\nMcWilliams et al. (2000) found that one third of the pulsed\nionospheric flows observed by the SuperDARN radars oc-\ncurred under northward IMF conditions. Below we will fur-\nther study FTEs observed during low-latitude merging when\nthe IMF is directed northwards. By \u201clow-latitude merg-\ning\u201d we mean merging occurring equatorward of the open-\nclosed field-line boundary between closed magnetospheric\nfield lines and the unconnected field lines of the IMF. The\nactual latitude at which this merging occurs, whether \u201clow\u201d\nor otherwise, is not examined in this paper. The term \u201clow-\nlatitude\u201d is thus only used to differentiate this merging pro-\ncess from the high-latitude lobe merging observed tailward\nof the cusp, between the IMF and open field lines of the tail\nlobe.\nIn this paper we present a case study of one day of pro-\nlonged northward IMF. During this interval, on 22 Decem-\nber 2002, the IMF Bz component was pointing continuously\nnorthward for more than 12 h, reaching values of up to 18 nT.\nWe study the global high-latitude ionospheric flow patterns\nusing the Northern and Southern Hemisphere SuperDARN\nradars. We also present data from the ACE spacecraft and\nthe F13 DMSP spacecraft. We study the effect of the IMF\nBy and Bz components on dayside reconnection processes\nthat occur during this northward IMF interval, giving partic-\nular attention to the pulsed nature of this reconnection.\n2 Instrumentation\nThe ionospheric convection velocities presented in this study\nare provided by the Northern and Southern Hemisphere Su-\nperDARN radars, part of the international SuperDARN chain\nof HF radars (Greenwald et al., 1995). At present there are\n9 SuperDARN radars imaging the high-latitude convection\nin the Northern Hemisphere, and 7 radars in the Southern\nHemisphere. Each radar of the system is frequency agile\n(8\u201320 MHz), and routinely measures the line-of-sight (l-o-s)\nDoppler velocity, the spectral width, and the backscattered\npower from ionospheric plasma irregularities. The radars\neach form 16 beams of azimuthal separation 3.24\u25e6. Each\nbeam is gated into 75 range bins. In the standard operation\n(normal resolution) mode used here, each gate has a length\nof 45 km and the dwell time for each beam is 7 s, giving a\nfull 16 beam scan, covering 52\u25e6 in azimuth and over 3000\nkm in range (an area of over 4\u00d706 km2), every 2 min. Dur-\ning this interval data were available from 6 of the 9 Northern\nHemisphere radars i.e. Hankasalmi (f), Iceland East (e), Ice-\nland West (w), Saskatoon (t), Kapuskasing (k), and Prince\nGeorge (b), and from 5 of the 7 Southern Hemisphere radars\ni.e. Syowa (j), Syowa East (n), Sanae (d), Halley (h), and\nTiger (r).

At 10:00 UT ACE is positioned upstream\nof the Earth at GSM position (X, Y, Z)=(241.7, 4.4, 13) RE .\nA 55 min lag time has been added onto the time scale of the\nplot, representing the delay between the IMF being observed\nby the satellite and when it impinges on the magnetopause,\ncalculated using the algorithm of Lester et al. (1993). IMF\nBx component is coloured blue, the IMF By component red\nand the IMF Bz component black. The middle panel of Fig-\nure 2 presents the absolute magnitude of the IMF By and Bz\ncomponents, again coloured red and black respectively. The\nbottom panel of Fig. 2 shows the IMF clock angle, calculated\nas\n\u03b8 = tan\u22121(By\/Bz). (1)\nAs stated previously, one of the main aims of this paper is\nto study the effect of variations in the IMF conditions on the\ndayside reconnection process. In order to achieve this we\nhave chosen to study two intervals during this day in detail.\nThe two time intervals are marked with black dashed vertical\nlines on Fig. 2, and labelled A and B. During both intervals\nthe IMF Bz component remains wholly positive (northward),\nand the IMF Bx component negative. During interval A,\nwhich lasts from 11:00 to 13:35 UT, the IMF By component\nis also positive and generally comparable with or larger than\nthe IMF Bz component. The IMF clock angle is thus pre-\ndominantly \u223c45\u25e6 or larger. During interval B, from 13:35 to\n16:10 UT, the IMF By component is generally negative and\nsmaller than the IMF Bz component. The first\u223c55 min of in-\nterval B, however, from 13:35 to 14:30 UT, are characterised\nby variable magnetic field conditions. The IMF By compo-\nnent changes from positive to negative values at 13:50 UT.\nThe IMF Bz component dominates the By component except\nfor a few minutes around 14:20 UT, when a strongly nega-\ntive By component results in a clock angle of \u223c\u221260\u25e6.

Dur-\ning interval A these two radar beams are predominantly ob-\nserving plasma flow near noon (Fig. 5). They observe fast\nplasma flow moving away from the radar. These flows are\nobserved at high latitudes, between 72\u25e6 and 82\u25e6 by the Han-\nkasalmi radar and between 75\u25e6 and 81\u25e6 by the Iceland West\nradar. These flows appear to have a pulsed nature. The Ice-\nland East radar is located in the post-noon region. Figure 3\nalso presents the l-o-s velocity from beam 2 of this radar,\nthis beam is looking in a zonal direction toward dusk. The\nIceland East radar is observing strong plasma flows moving\ntowards the radar which are also variable with time. The\nKapuskasing radar is located in the morning sector, and is\nobserving little backscatter in this interval.\nIn the Southern Hemisphere the Syowa East, Syowa and\nSanae radars are located on the dayside (Fig. 5).

L-o-s velocities are shown from four of the Southern Hemisphere radars from 10:00 to 17:00 UT; Syowa East (beam 5), Syowa (beam\n8), Sanae (beam 12) and Tiger (beam 5). Time intervals A and B are indicated by the red vertical dashed lines.\nvelocities presented in Fig, 4 demonstrate that the radars all\nobserve strong flows moving away from the radar. There is\nindication that this plasma flow is pulsed. The Tiger radar\nis located on the nightside during this interval. The radar\nobserves little backscatter for the majority of interval A, al-\nthough the radar starts to observe strong flows towards the\nradar at the end of the interval.\nThe l-o-s velocities from all the SuperDARN radars were\ncombined to produce global convection maps of plasma con-\nvection for both the Northern and the Southern hemispheres\nfor intervals A and B, using the map-potential technique\n(Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998). Figure 6a presents map-\npotential flow vectors and fitted equipotential streamlines in\nthe Northern Hemisphere for the interval 13:28 to 13:30 UT,\ngiving a snap-shot of the Northern Hemisphere convection\npattern during interval A. The vectors are presented as a\nfunction of magnetic local time and magnetic latitude, with\n12 MLT located at the top of the plot, and dusk to the left.\nThe velocity of the fitted vectors is coded both in colour (blue\nindicating the slowest velocities, red the fastest) and in the\nlength of the vectors. The flow pattern is a standard two-cell\nconvection pattern with anti-sunward flow over the polar cap\nand sunward return flow at lower latitude. The dusk flow cell\ndominates the dawn flow cell, with significant flow of dusk\nsector plasma across the noon meridian. This type of convec-\ntion pattern is similar to southward IMF intervals, when mag-\nnetosheath field lines reconnect with closed magnetopsheric\nfield lines at the dayside magnetopause (Dungey, 1963). We\nbelieve that the large IMF By component during interval A is\ncreating a magnetic shear at the dayside magnetopause suf-\nficient for \u201clow-latitude\u201d reconnection to occur, although a\nlobe cell may also be present as discussed further below. We\nnote that previous studies have indicated that \u201clow-latitude\u201d\nreconnection and open flux production may not switch off\nentirely until the clock angle falls below \u223c30\u25e6 (Sandholt et\nal., 1998; Grocott et al., 2003)\nFigure 6b presents the map-potential flow vectors in the\nSouthern Hemisphere for the same time interval. Again\n12 MLT is at the top of the page, and dusk is to the left. The\nflow pattern is very similar to the Northern Hemisphere flow\npattern for this time interval, a standard two-cell convection\npattern with anti-sunward flow at high-latitude and sunward\nflow at lower latitude. It appears that in the Southern Hemi-\nsphere the post-noon convection cell is also dominating the\npre-noon cell. However, we do not feel confident to discuss\ndawn-dusk distortions of the Southern Hemisphere flow pat-\ntern, since a lack of data points, especially in the dawn and\npre-noon regions, precludes us from making such compar-\nisons. This lack of data points could also result in the map-\npotential flow contours being more dependent on the statis-\ntical model to which the flow vectors are fitted, rather than\nto actual geophysical observations. It is, nevertheless, strik-\ning that a well-developed anti-sunward flow is present in the\nmidnight sector, indicative of on-going Dungey-cycle con-\nvection.\nG.

This spacecraft pass occurred during interval A\nand is contemporaneous with the SuperDARN data presented\nin Fig. 6. The spacecraft pass was in the Northern Hemi-\nsphere, and flew through the fields of view of the Hankasalmi\nand Iceland East radars. Overplotted dashed lines mark the\nboundaries between different plasma regions. The spacecraft\nis first located on closed field lines in the dusk sector, demon-\nstrated by the high energies of the precipitating ions and elec-\ntrons. At 13:27:33 UT the spacecraft crosses into a region\nwe have labelled as the \u201clow-latitude boundary layer\u201d (llbl),\nwhere the energy of the precipitating electrons decreases, and\nthe spacecraft observes clear evidence of electron accelera-\ntion. At 13:28:38 UT the energy of the precipitating ions also\nsignificantly decreases, such that we judge the spacecraft to\nbe now located on open field lines. The energy of the pre-\ncipitating particles in this region is similar to that observed\nby Eriksson et al.

The spacecraft then briefly passes through the llbl region\nagain before moving onto closed field lines which generally\ncoincide with the sunward flows of the dawn convection cell.\nAlso shown in Fig. 8 are the cross-track plasma velocity\nvectors measured by the DMSP spacecraft. These are in gen-\neral accord with the SuperDARN flow map, though some\nsmall-scale features are observed in the spacecraft data in the\ndusk sector, as will be discussed further below in Sect. 4, that\nare not reproduced in the large-scale radar map. In addition\nit will be noted that there is a discrepancy in the sense of the\ncross-track flow in the noon sector, with the radar-derived\nmap indicating an antisunward flow in this region, while the\nspacecraft data indicate a weak sunward flow. We note, how-\never, that radar backscatter is not actually observed in this\nspecific region during the interval (see Fig. 6a) with the im-\nplication that the streamlines of the \u201cdusk\u201d cell are actually\nmore extended across noon into the dawn sector than is im-\nplied by the radar map. The principal flow at the spacecraft\nwas thus most probably a flow along the track from dusk-to-\ndawn.\nFigure 9 presents the l-o-s velocity observed in beam 2 of\nthe Hankasalmi radar and beam 4 of the Syowa East radar\nduring interval A. The Hankasalmi and Syowa East radars\nview approximately conjugate regions of the ionosphere but\nwith different viewing direction to the flow. The Hanksalmi\nradar is clearly observing pulsed ionospheric flows (PIFs)\nmoving away from the radar at high latitude. The PIFs have\na recurrence rate of approximately 15 min. Some of the PIFs\nhave been identified on Fig. 9 with black lines, in order to\nguide the eye. Previous work by Provan et al. (1998) has\nidentified PIFs as being the ionospheric signature of FTEs\noccurring at the dayside magnetopause. The Syowa East\nradar is observing a flow reversal boundary with the plasma\nflowing towards the radar equatorwards of the boundary and\naway from the radar polewards of the boundary. Syowa East\nalso appears to be observing pulsed flows at this time, pole-\nward of the flow reversal boundary. A few of these flows\nhave been tentatively identified with black lines. However,\nthe pulsed flow signatures in the Southern Hemisphere plot\nare not as clear and easy to identify as the pulsed signatures\nobserved in the Northern Hemisphere.\nIn order to further examine the pulsed flow, we selected a\nfew range gates within the main regions of backscatter iden-\ntified in Fig. 9, and present the averaged l-o-s velocity from\nthese ranges in Fig. 10. The top panel shows the average l-o-\ns velocity observed at six ranges between magnetic latitude\n76\u25e6 to 80\u25e6 for beam 2 of the Hanksalmi radar.

The dashed black lines presented on the graphs\nare the standard deviation of the average velocity. Figure 10\nclearly demonstrates that flow pulses are observed in both\nhemispheres, as marked by the solid red lines, with the mag-\nnitude of the l-o-s velocities fluctuating with time. These\nPIFs have an average recurrence period of \u223c15 min in both\nthe Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\nFTEs at the dayside magnetopause result in the addition\nof open flux to the polar-cap and the subsequent equator-\nward motion of the polar cap boundary. Previous work by\nMilan et al. (1998) demonstrated that the latitudinal extent\nof the ionospheric backscatter in the dayside auroral regions\nrelates to the boundaries of geophysical processes. Specifi-\ncally, Rodger et al. (1995) and Milan et al. (1999) identified\nthe equatorward boundary of the radar backscatter near noon\nto be co-located with the equatorward boundary of 630 nm\nemission from cusp precipitation. Although the open-closed\nfield line boundary (OCB) may be typically displaced a few\ntens of km equatorward of the boundary of the emission, we\ncan thus nevertheless use the backscatter boundary to track\nthe motion of the OCB poleward or equatorward. The equa-\ntorward edge of the radar backscatter for the interval stud-\nied here has been determined from the Northern Hemisphere\nmap-potential global convection plots. Figure 11 presents\nthe position of the equatorward boundary of radar backscat-\nter from 11:30 to 13:30 UT during interval A. The position\nof the boundary is quantised by the map-potential grid to\nwhich the vectors are mapped, which has grid cells which\nare 1\u25e6 in latitude (\u223c111 km projected onto the Earth\u2019s sur-\nface), and as close to 111 km in longitude as possible. The\nequatorward boundary of radar backscatter is at a latitude of\n78.5\u25e6 at 11:30 UT, but by 13:30 UT the boundary has moved\nequatoward to a latitude of 69.5\u25e6. This equatorward pro-\ngression of the radar backscatter is not gradual and contin-\nuous, but stepwise, with an equatorward \u201cstep\u201d of the bound-\nary approximately every 15 min. However, between \u223c12:15\nand \u223c12:35 UT the radar backscatter boundary moved in a\nmainly poleward direction, at this time the IMF Bz compo-\nnent was generally equal to or greater than the By compo-\nnent.\n3.4 Interval B\nWe have defined interval B as lasting from 13:35 to 16:10 UT.\nDuring this time the IMF Bz component was generally\nlarger the By component, except for a few minutes around\n14:20 UT when the IMF By component became strongly neg-\nG. Provan et al.: Pulsed flows observed during an interval of prolonged northward IMF 1217\native resulting in a clock angle of \u223c\u221260\u25e6. Between 14:30\nand 16:10 UT the IMF conditions were fairly steady with the\nIMF Bz component dominating the By component.\nStudying Figs. 3 and 4, we can see that there is a rapid\nand extensive reconfiguration in the plasma flow observed\nby the SuperDARN radars between interval A and interval B.\nThe IMF Bz component starts to dominate By at 13:35 UT.\nFor the next ten minutes or so the plasma flow appears un-\nchanged with the Hankasalmi and Iceland West radars con-\ntinuing to observe strong flows away from the radar and the\nIceland East radar continuing to observe strong flows towards\nthe radar. Between \u223c13:50 and \u223c14:00 UT these three day-\nside Northern Hemisphere radars all observe a decrease in\nl-o-s velocity. This may be related to the changing direction\nof the IMF By component at 13:50 UT. At \u223c14:00 UT the\nIceland West and Iceland East radars both start to observe\nstrong flows, directed in the opposite direction to the flows\nobserved prior to \u223c13:50 UT.\nFigure 12 presents Northern Hemisphere map-potential\nflow vectors and equipotential streamlines for the interval\n14:02 to 14:04 UT. A four cell flow pattern is observed, as\nopposed to the two-cell pattern detected during interval A.\nThe two high-latitude cells are \u201creverse\u201d convection cells\nwith sunward flow over the polar-cap and anti-sunward flow\nat lower latitude, with the post-noon cell being stronger than\nthe pre-noon cell. The plasma flow in the two lower lati-\ntude cells are rotating in the \u201cstandard\u201d direction with anti-\nsunward flow at high-latitude. The overall flow pattern is\ntypical of flows observed during northward IMF when lobe\nmerging is occurring (e.g. Burke et al., 1979; Knipp et al.,\n1991; Freeman et al., 1993).\nThe multi-cell flow pattern shown in Fig. 12 is the first\nfour cell flow pattern to be observed by the radars during\ninterval B. Thus it takes \u223c25 min from when the IMF Bz\ncomponent starts to dominate the By component, until the\nfirst four cell flow pattern is observed. In the transitional pe-\nriod between 13:35 and 14:02 UT the ionospheric flow pat-\ntern is very variable, with highly distorted two cell patterns,\nand some three cell patterns, being observed. This dynamic\nhigh-latitude convection is observed as the global convection\nreconfigures from a standard convection pattern to a reverse\nconvection pattern, however it will also be influenced by the\nvariable magnetic field conditions observed during this time.\nAfter 14:30 UT the magnetic field conditions become\nmore stable with the Bz component dominating the By com-\nponent. Figure 13 presents the Northern Hemisphere map-\npotential flow vectors and equipotential streamlines observed\nat three times during interval B; for 2 min intervals starting\nat (a) 15:00 UT, (b) 15:08 UT and (c) 15:26 UT. The reasons\nfor selecting these specific times will be explained later in\nthis section. Again, four convection cells are observed dur-\ning each interval. Due to the lack of backscatter in the South-\nern Hemisphere during interval B, we are unable to present a\nsimilar analysis of the Southern Hemisphere flows.\nFigure 14 presents data from the DMSP F13 spacecraft\nfor the time interval 15:06:00 to 15:20 UT.

The Northern Hemisphere map-potential flow vectors and equipotential flow streamlines observed at two minute intervals starting\nat: (a) 15:00 UT, (b) 15:08 UT and (c) 15:26 UT.\nFigure 15 presents a polar-plot of the DMSP F13 space-\ncraft track across the Northern Hemisphere polar region from\n15:06 to 15:20 UT. The track is presented as a function of\nMLAT and MLT, with local noon being located at the top of\nthe plot. The track of the spacecraft is coloured blue equa-\ntorward of the open-closed field line boundary, and red pole-\nward of the open-closed field line boundary. Overlaid on the\nplot are the potential contours observed by the map-potential\ntechnique from 15:08 to 15:10 UT (previously presented in\nFig. 11). From the figure it can be seen that the two OCB\nidentified in Fig. 14 are located near the poleward boundary\nof the low-latitude dawn and dusk cells, such that the low-\nlatitude dawn and dusk cells are located on closed field lines.\nIn the previous section we demonstrated that pulsed flows\nwere observed during interval A. As stated above pulsed\nflows are also observed during interval B, which we will now\nstudy in more detail. Figure 16 presents the l-o-s velocity\nvectors observed by beam 15 of the Kapuskasing radar and\nbeam 2 of the Iceland East radar from 13:50 to 16:10 UT\nduring interval B. Beam 15 of the Kapuskasing radar is ob-\nserving the cusp region at this time, and observes flow to-\nwards the radar. Before\u223c14:30 UT the observed l-o-s veloc-\nity is comparatively small, after 14:30 UT the l-o-s velocity\nincreases significantly. There also appears to be a decline in\nradar backscatter for a few minutes at \u223c14:25 UT. This de-\ncline, and the subsequent increase in the observed l-o-s ve-\nlocity, is probably due to the variable IMF conditions during\n\u223c14:20 to \u223c14:30 UT. The IMF Bz component dominated\nthe By component for most of interval B, expect for a few\nminutes around \u223c14:20 UT. After 14:30 UT the magnetic\nfield conditions remained relatively stable, with the IMF Bz\ncomponent significantly larger than the By component. Five\nclear flow bursts are observed during interval B, these pulses\nbeing marked with overplotted black dashed lines. As the\nfluctuating IMF conditions before 14:30 UT may affect the\nflow pulsations, and the occurrence of radar backscatter, we\nconcentrate on the flows observed after 14:30 UT when the\nIMF conditions were relatively stable. Four pulses are ob-\nserved between \u223c14:30 and \u223c16:00 UT, thus having a peri-\nodicity of approximately 25 min. Beam 2 of the Iceland East\nradar is located in the post-noon sector at this time, and is\npointing in an azimuthal direction, observing the dusk sector.\nThe radar observes strong pulsed flow away from the radar.\nDue to the zonal pointing direction of the radar beam these\npulses can be more difficult to identify in the Iceland East\ndata as compared with the Kapuskasing radar. The approx-\nimate position of five pulses observed by the Iceland East\nradar is marked on the bottom panel of Figure 16 with over-\nplotted black lines.\nWe wish to study the global flow patterns during the pulsed\nflows in more detail. Superimposed on the Kapuskasing l-\no-s velocity presented in Fig. 16 are three red arrows la-\nbeled (a), (b), and (c). Arrow (a) is positioned just before\na flow burst at 15:00 UT, arrow (b) is positioned in the mid-\ndle of a flow burst at 15:08 UT and arrow (c) just after the\nflow burst at 15:26 UT. The map-potential flow patterns from\nthese times have already been presented in Fig. 13, and la-\nbelled (a), (b), and (c). At all times multi-cell flow patterns\nare observed with the high-latitude post-noon flow cell dom-\ninating the high-latitude pre-noon flow cells. At time (a) rel-\natively low velocity flows are observed by the radars. At\ntime (b) much stronger velocity flows are observed by the\nNorthern Hemisphere radars. This increase in the strength\nand magnitude of the plasma flow is particularly evident in\nthe high-latitude post-noon flow cell with increased flow ob-\nserved from 11:00 MLT to 21:00 MLT. At time (c) (after the\nflow burst) the magnitude of the plasma flow has again de-\ncreased.\nIn order to analyse whether these bursts of lobe reconnec-\ntion were affecting the amount of open flux within the po-\nlar cap, we again used the equatorward boundary of radar\nbackscatter at magnetic noon to track the position of the\nOCB. As in interval A, the equatorward edge of the radar\nbackscatter was determined from the Northern Hemisphere\nmap-potential global convection maps. Figure 17 presents\nthe latitude of the equatorward edge of the radar backscat-\nG.

The two black dashed lines on the plot indicate\nboundaries between open and closed field lines.\nter at magnetic local noon between 14:30 UT and 16:10 UT.\nThis period was chosen as the IMF was particularly stable\nduring this time. The radar backscatter boundary was at a\nlatitude of 74.5\u25e6 at 14:30 UT, but by 16:10 UT it had moved\npoleward to a latitude of 76.5\u25e6. This poleward motion of the\nboundary was not steady, but occurred in a stepwise manner.\nBetween 14:30 and 16:10 there were five poleward retrac-\ntions of the boundary, with the boundary relaxing slightly\nequatorward between each of these retractions. Thus, there\nwas an average time period \u223c23 min between each poleward\nretraction of the radar backscatter, similar to the repetition\nrate of the bursts of lobe reconnection. Our observations are\nconsistent with the closure of open flux at the dayside mag-\nnetopause during these bursts of lobe reconnection, resulting\nin the stepwise retraction of the OCB.\n4 Discussion\nWe have performed a detailed case study of one interval of\nprolonged northward IMF, which occurred on 22 December\n2002. We have utilised data from the Northern and Southern\nHemisphere SuperDARN radars, the low-altitude F13 DMSP\nspacecraft, the ACE spacecraft, as well as the map-potential\nanalysis tool. We have studied two intervals during this day\nin particular detail. During interval A (11:00 to 13:35 UT)\nthe IMF By component was positive and comparable with\nor greater in magnitude than the IMF Bz component. Dur-\ning interval B (13:35 to 16:10 UT), the IMF Bz component\nwas predominantly greater than the By component (except\nfor a few minutes around 14:20 UT). This change in the IMF\nconditions corresponded to a significant change in the high-\nlatitude convection pattern.\nWe have presented map-potential global convection\npatterns for both the northern and Southern Hemisphere. The\nconvection patterns are calculated by a mathematical fitting\ntechnique using all the available line-of-sight velocity mea-\nsurements. The solution is constrained by folding in infor-\nmation from a statistical model (Ruohoniemi and Greenwald,\n1996), keyed to the IMF conditions. As the l-o-s vectors are\nfitted to a model, it is always useful to investigate how im-\n1220 G.

The track of the spacecraft is\ncoloured blue equatorward of the open-closed field line boundary,\nand red poleward of the open-closed field line boundary. Overlaid\non the plot are the potential contours observed by the map-potential\ntechnique from 15:08 to 15:10 UT\nportant the model is in determining the final convection pat-\ntern. Since the model is parameterised by the upstream IMF,\na good way to check its influence is to force the model to use\na fixed IMF input with different characteristics to those actu-\nally observed (e.g. Grocott et al., 2002). For the present\nstudy we reanalysed our northward IMF interval with the\nIMF input fixed in a strong southerly orientation with an op-\nposite sense of By . The results, while sometimes different in\nregions of little or no radar backscatter, showed similar flow\npatterns in regions where radar data were present. Indeed,\nevidence of lobe \u201creverse\u201d convection cells was still clearly\napparent, even though the statistical model for southward\nIMF conditions contains no such cells. This illustrates that,\nin the present case, the data are clearly dominating the model\nin our determination of the convection pattern and gives us\nconfidence in using these pattern to draw conclusions on the\nnature of the flow.\nDuring interval A both the Northern and Southern Hemi-\nsphere map-potential flow contours showed a distorted twin\ncell convection pattern with anti-sunward flow at high-\nlatitude, and sunward return flow at lower latitude (Figs. 6a\nand b). The Northern Hemisphere flow pattern is distorted\nwith the dusk flow cell dominating the dawn cell, and signif-\nicant flow of dusk sector plasma across the noon meridian.\nThe Southern Hemisphere radars also observed a two-cell\nconvection pattern (Fig. 6b). It would appear from the de-\nrived convection pattern that in the Southern Hemisphere the\npost-noon convection cell is dominating the pre-noon cell.\nHowever, we do not feel confident in discussing potential\ndistortion in the Southern Hemisphere flow pattern, due to\nthe lack of data in the dawn and pre-noon regions. The pres-\nence of antisunward flow in the midnight sector, however,\nis consistent with the continuous presence of Dungey cycle\nconvection.\nHeppner and Maynard (1987) presented Northern Hemi-\nsphere empirical flow patterns for intervals of positive IMF\nBy . The distorted two-cell convection pattern observed by\nHeppner and Maynard (1987) under weakly positive IMF\nBz conditions are similar to the Northern Hemisphere flow\npattern presented in Fig. 6a. The flow pattern shows the\ntypical By asymmetry that one would expect for standard\nDungey-cell flow, as has previously been discussed by e.g.\nJ\u00f8rgensen et al. (1972) and Cowley (1981). It is interest-\ning to note that this By flow asymmetry persists when the\nclock angle is \u223c50\u25e6 to \u223c60\u25e6. Grocott et al. (2003) has ob-\nserved a highly distorted By dominated twin cell flow pattern\nwhen the IMF clock angle was \u223c\u221250\u25e6 to \u223c\u221260\u25e6. Our re-\nsults support previous observations by e.g. Clauer and Friis-\nChristensen (1988), Freeman et al. (1993) and Greenwald\net al. (1995), that during intervals of positive IMF Bz and\na large IMF By , the magnetic shear at the dayside magne-\ntopause is sufficient for reconnection to occur equatorward\nof the polar cap, resulting in the creation of a distorted two-\ncell convection pattern. Similar conclusions have also been\nreached from studies of the cusp auroral morphology (e.g.\nSandholt et al., 1998).\nHowever, in this study combining global convection pat-\nterns with particle precipitation observations have shown that\nthe observed convection pattern does not just consist of two\ndistorted merging cells. Within the centre of the dusk con-\nvection cell we observed polar cap arc particle precipitation.\nSuch precipitation has previously been observed in a dusk\nconvection cell during an interval of positive IMF By and Bz\nwhere By\u001dBz (Eriksson et al., 2002, 2003). Eriksson et al.\n(2002, 2003) observed the polar cap arc particle precipita-\ntion on sunward flow within a high-latitude lobe cell in the\ndusk region. The lobe cell was located next to a viscous cell\nwithin the dusk merging cell. The observed convection pat-\ntern was a three-cell convection system of coexisting merg-\ning, viscous and lobe-type convection cells, as suggested by\nBurch et al. (1985) and Reiff and Burch (1985). During in-\ntervals of positive (negative) IMF By they predicted that the\ndusk (dawn) merging cell dominates the dawn (dusk) cell\nin the Northern Hemisphere, and that the lobe and viscous\ncells where to be found within the dusk (dawn) merging cell.\nEriksson et al. (2002) found that the existence of such com-\nposite convection cells was strongly linked to conditions of\nIMF By \/Bz>1. The observations presented in this paper are\nconsistent with a large IMF By component creating a mag-\nnetic shear at the dayside magnetopause sufficient for recon-\nnection to occur on closed field lines located equatorward of\nthe OCB, simultaneously with merging in the high-latitude\nlobe regions.\nIn this study we observed a lobe convection cell within the\ncentre of the dusk merging cell. Burch et al. (1985) suggested\nthat equatorward of this lobe cell we should observe a narrow\nviscous cell. A convection reversal should then be observed\nwithin the viscous cell and a second flow reversal should be\nobserved within the higher-latitude sunward flow cell of the\nG.

The map-potential global convection pattern does\nnot observed this anti-clockwise rotating viscous cell, how-\never the cross-track DMSP vectors shows a narrow regions of\nanti-sunward flow at the equatorward edge of the lobe con-\nvection cell, consistent with the viscous convection cell pre-\ndicted by Burch et al. (1985). It is possible that this narrow\nflow cell is not present on the map-potential global convec-\ntion pattern as the map-potential technique produce global\nmaps of the plasma flow, and small-scale flow changes may\nbe overlooked.\nThe dusk lobe cell lies within polar-cap arc precipitation,\nas defined by Lyons et al. (1996). Eriksson et al. (2002, 2003)\nreported that such polar-cap arc precipitation is associated\nwith sunward flow on high-latitude lobe cells. Our observa-\ntions suggest that the polar-cap arc precipitation is associated\nwith both the sunward and anti-sunward flow of the lobe cell.\nHowever, this result may be due to the shape of the lobe cell\nnot being accurately reproduced by the map-potential algo-\nrithm as mentioned earlier. The lobe cell was partially within\nthe field-of-view of the Goose Bay radar at this time, and\nas stated above the Goose Bay radar was not working dur-\ning this interval. The DMSP flow vectors also suggest that\nthere is a flow stagnation region within the lobe cell, with\nsome very weak anti-sunward flow being observed. Eriksson\net al. (2002) also observed a flow stagnation region within\na high-latitude lobe cell, poleward of the region of sunward\nplasma convection. They noted that Phan et al., 2000 re-\nported that the WIND spacecraft observed a similar region\nof stagnant magnetosheath-like ions deep inside the magne-\ntotail lobes.\nReiff and Heelis (1994) have suggested that the distorted\ntwo-cell convection pattern may be a transitional pattern\nwhich occurs as the IMF conditions changes. Our results,\nand the results presented by Greenwald et al. (1995) and Gro-\ncott et al. (2003), would suggest that the distorted two-cell\nconvection pattern is a stable configuration, occurring when\nthe IMF By component is positive and dominates the IMF Bz\ncomponent.\n1222 G.

The latitudinal position of the equatorward boundary of\nradar backscatter at local magnetic noon, observed between 14:30\nand 16:10 UT during interval B.\nDuring interval A, the Northern and Southern Hemi-\nsphere radars observed pulsed high-velocity flows moving to\nhigher-latitudes with time, with an average recurrence rate\nof \u223c15 min (Figs. 9 and 10). This flow was observed to lie\nwithin the two merging cells, and it is not yet clear whether\nthe flow within the dusk lobe cell was also pulsating. Dur-\ning interval A the equatorward edge of the Northern Hemi-\nsphere radar backscatter also moved equatorward in a step-\nwise manner approximately every 15 min, suggesting that the\nOCB moved in a similar manner. In the past, pulsed flows\nhave been observed on open field lines by the SuperDARN\nradars (Provan et al., 1998), and have been identified as being\nthe ionospheric signatures of FTEs occurring at the dayside\nmagnetopause. The observations presented here are consis-\ntent with flux transfer events occurring at the dayside magne-\ntopause with a repetition rate of \u223c15 min. The FTEs are ob-\nserved as PIFs in the radar data, and result in the bursty addi-\ntion of open flux to the dayside magnetosphere and the subse-\nquent stepwise equatoward expansion of the OCB. Previous\nwork by Milan et al. (1999) used the equatorward bound-\nary of the radar aurora as a proxy for the open-closed field\nline boundary, and related the rapid equatorward motions\nof this boundary to the occurrence of individual flux trans-\nfer events. Our results are the first detailed analysis of flux\ntransfer events observed during an interval of northward IMF.\nHowever, McWilliams et al. (2000) performed a statistical\nstudy of pulsed ionospheric flows. The analysis technique\nwas based on the Fourier transform, which was used to se-\nlect the dominant repetition rates of the periodic flow bursts\nseen along the radar line-of-sight. One third of the pulsed\nionospheric flow intervals occurred when the interplanetary\nmagnetic field had a northward component, although the rel-\native magnitude of the By component was not considered by\nthese authors.\nDuring interval B the IMF Bz component was generally\ngreater than the IMF By component. The l-o-s velocities\nobserved in the Northern (Fig. 3) and Southern (Fig. 4)\nHemispheres demonstrated an extensive and dramatic re-\norganisation of the high-latitude plasma flows. In the North-\nern Hemisphere the high-latitude flow pattern changed from\na standard two cell convection pattern to a reverse four cell\nconvection pattern over a\u223c25 min period. However, the vari-\nable IMF conditions might have effected the time it took for\nthe flow patterns to reorganise. Previous work by e.g. Clauer\nand Friis-Christensen (1988), and Freeman et al. (1993)\nstated that while a distorted standard two cell convection pat-\ntern could be observed during northward IMF Bz and large\nIMF By conditions, convection under a northward IMF Bz\nbut a small IMF By was most consistent with a four cell con-\nvection pattern, as found here.\nThe Southern Hemisphere radars which observed the day-\nside during intervals A and B (Syowa, Syowa East and\nSanae) experienced a sudden decline in radar backscatter\nduring interval B, as compared with interval A. However, this\ndecline in the radar backscatter may be related to a change in\nthe direction of the IMF By component at 13:50 UT, from By\npositive to By negative.\nThe observed multi-cell flow pattern observed in the\nNorthern Hemisphere consisted of two high-latitude reverse\nconvection cells with sunward flow over the pole, and two\nlower-latitude standard flow cells with anti-sunward flow.\nReverse convection cells observed during northward IMF are\nindicative of lobe merging, as described by Dungey (1963).\nData from the DMSP F13 spacecraft indicates that the two\nstandard cells could lie on closed field lines. During interval\nB pulses of reverse convection were clearly observed by the\nKapuskasing and Iceland East radars (Fig. 16). The pulsed\nflows had a periodicity of \u223c25 min. The flow bursts were\nassociated with a stepwise poleward retraction of the equa-\ntorward boundary of radar backscatter. Similar bursts of re-\nverse convection and a stepwise poleward motion of radar\nbackscatter have previously been observed by Sandholt et\nal. (2000). These authors reported a case study of an interval\ncontaining a rapid northward turning of the IMF. This north-\nward turning was accompanied by a long stepwise poleward\nretraction and latitudinal widening of the band of auroral\nemission in the Northern Hemisphere cusp region. Data from\nselected Northern Hemisphere SuperDARN radars demon-\nstrated that the auroral poleward motion was associated with\nbursts of reverse two-cell convection, and a stepwise pole-\nward motion of the radar backscatter. They concluded that\nthe observations were consistent with a theoretical descrip-\ntion of a sequence of bursts of lobe merging involving both\nhemispheres, resulting in closed flux being added to the day-\nside magnetosphere. We believe the same process to be oc-\ncurring here. The retraction of the equatorward boundary\nof radar backscatter is consistent with the lobe reconnection\noccurring in both hemispheres, adding closed flux to the day-\nside magnetosphere (Cowley, 1981, 1983; Cowley and Lock-\nG. Provan et al.: Pulsed flows observed during an interval of prolonged northward IMF 1223\nwood, 1992). The fact that the retraction of the radar backs-\nactter is occurring in a stepwise manner is due to the bursty\nnature of the lobe reconnection.\nIt is not necessary for lobe reconnection to occur simulta-\nneously in both hemispheres. As illustrated in Fig. 1, lobe re-\nconnection can occur first in one hemisphere and then later in\nthe other. The net result is the formation of a closed dayside\nfield line, and completely detached field lines in the tail. In\nthis study one might assume that the Northern Hemisphere is\nthe favoured hemisphere for lobe reconnection, because even\nthough our interval is close to the northern winter solstice,\nthere is a strong negative IMF Bx component. As already dis-\ncussed in the introduction, Cowley (1983) argues that if the\nIMF is pointed antisunward, the Northern Hemisphere will\nbe the favoured hemisphere for reconnection as the geomag-\nnetic field will be anti-parallel to the IMF in this hemisphere.\nCowley (1983) indicated that reconnection in the unfavoured\nhemisphere may then be activated at a later stage. It is un-\nfortunate that the lack of Southern Hemisphere radar data\nprecludes us from ascertaining the large-scale high-latitude\nconvection pattern in the Southern Hemisphere, which would\nenable us to determine whether the observed lobe merging is\nsimultaneous in the two hemispheres, or sequential.\nThe bursts of lobe reconnection had a repetition rate which\nwas significantly longer than the periodicity of the flux trans-\nfer events in interval A. We do not know the reason for this.\nA preliminary study of the solar wind conditions during in-\ntervals A and B, using data from the ACE spacecraft (not\nshown) does not show any significant changes in the nature\nof the solar wind between the two intervals. Pulsed reconnec-\ntion occurring during northward IMF intervals has previously\nbeen discussed by Rodger et al. (2000), who outlined some\nof the implications of assuming that reconnection occurring\nin regions where the magnetosheath flow is super-Alfvenic\nmust be transient. They used a simple magnetospheric model\nto illustrate where magnetopause reconnection is most likely\nto occur, and showed that the location of these regions is de-\npendent critically on the dipole tilt angle and the interplane-\ntary conditions. As the clock angle rotates away from 180\u25e6,\nthe ratio of transient to quasi-steady reconnection increases.\nThe authors stated that for purely northward IMF conditions\nreconnection is almost always likely to be transient.\n5 Summary\nWe have performed a detailed case study of global plasma\nconvection observed during an interval of prolonged North-\nward IMF. We combined map-potential global convection\npatterns derived from the SuperDARN radar data with DMSP\ncross-track plasma drift vectors and DMSP particle precipi-\ntation patterns. Our main observations are as follows.\n1. During interval A when the magnitude of the IMF By\ncomponent was comparable with or greater than the\nIMF Bz component, a distorted standard two-cell con-\nvection pattern was observed in both the Northern and\nSouthern hemispheres. In the Northern Hemisphere we\nobserved a lobe convection cell in the centre of the dusk\nmerging cell, and possibly a narrow viscous cell located\nequatorward of this lobe cell.\n2. Under these conditions pulsed ionospheric flows were\nobserved in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere\ncusp region with a periodicity of \u223c15 min. The equa-\ntorward boundary of radar backscatter in the Northern\nHemisphere progressed equatorward in a stepwise man-\nner approximately every 15 min. We infer that during\ninterval A flux transfer events were occurring at the day-\nside magnetopause, resulting in open magnetic flux be-\ning added to the dayside magnetosphere.\n3. The observations made during interval A are consistent\nwith the large IMF By component creating a magnetic\nshear at the dayside magnetopause sufficient for recon-\nnection to occur on closed field lines located equator-\nward of the open-closed field line boundary, simultane-\nously to merging in the high-latitude lobe regions.\n4. During interval B the IMF Bz component was gener-\nally larger than the IMF By component. In the North-\nern Hemisphere a multi-cell flow pattern with four flow\ncells was observed. The re-configuration time was\n\u223c25 min, though the IMF showed significant variation\nalso during this interval. The two high-latitude flow\ncells were \u201creverse\u201d convection cells with sunward flow\nover the polar-cap. The two lower-latitude flow cells\nwere \u2018standard\u2019 convection cells associated with anti-\nsunward flow at high-latitude and sunward flow at lower\nlatitude. It has not been possible to draw conclusions\nabout the plasma flow in the Southern Hemisphere, as\nvery little backscatter was observed in this hemisphere\nduring interval B.\n5. During interval B pulsed reverse flows were observed.\nThese pulses had a periodicity of\u223c25 min, which is sig-\nnificantly longer that the periodicity of the pulsed flows\nobserved during interval A. The pulses corresponded\nwith stepwise poleward retractions of the equatorward\nboundary of the Northern Hemisphere radar backscat-\nter.\n6. The observations made during interval B are consis-\ntent with bursts of lobe reconnection occurring in both\nhemispheres, resulting in bursts of reverse ionospheric\nconvection and the stepwise poleward retraction of the\npolar-cap boundary as closed magnetic flux is added to\nthe dayside magnetosphere.\nOverall, this case study demonstrates that during an inter-\nval of northward IMF the relative magnitudes of the IMF By\nand Bz components determined the latitudes of the reconnec-\ntion sites between the IMF and the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere.\nBoth low-latitude and lobe reconnection were pulsed, and\nresulted in a stepwise motion of the open-closed field line\nboundary. Interestingly, when only lobe reconnection was\n1224 G. Provan et al.: Pulsed flows observed during an interval of prolonged northward IMF\nobserved the bursts of reconnection had a significantly longer\nperiodicity than when simultaneous lower-latitude and lobe\nmerging occurred.\nAcknowledgements.
