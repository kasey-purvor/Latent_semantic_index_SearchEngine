The research is based on semi-structured interviews with warehouse design\ncompanies to identify the range of agility types that were regarded as necessary during the\ndesign phase, and how these were addressed.

New warehouses continue to be designed and\nbuilt and there is some evidence that there is in fact an increasing trend in the building of\nlarge distribution centres (Baker 2004).\nThese distribution centres play a vital role in the success, or failure, of businesses\n(Frazelle 2002a) but they also represent significant investments with long asset lives. Owing\nto their size, investment is required not only in the land and buildings but also in automated\n3equipment, such as conveyorised sortation equipment, so as to contain costs (Pfohl et al.\n1992). However, these characteristics may be in conflict with the need for agile supply chains\nand there is concern in the trade press, for example, about the degree of flexibility offered by\nlarge automated warehouses (e.g. Matthews 2001 and Allen 2003).\nThis paper examines the concept of supply chain agility specifically in relation to the\nroles that distribution centres may play. Within this context, a model is developed to\ninvestigate how distribution centres may be designed to meet the requirements of agility and\nto examine the cost, time and service implications of these design features. The model is then\ndeveloped further with six warehouse design companies to identify whether it encompasses\nthe design features used in actual distribution centre designs. Actual design features used to\naddress different types of agility are identified, and an outline framework is developed, which\nare intended to be of benefit to practitioners in the field.\n2 Supply chain agility\nThere have been a number of definitions of supply chain agility and many of these reflect the\naspirational nature of the concept, as noted by Stratton and Warburton 2003. One such\ndefinition is that \u201cAgility is the basis for achieving competitive advantage in changing market\nconditions\u201d (Bal et al. 1999, p.75). This definition describes the concept fairly succinctly.\nSome definitions go further than just describing the overall capability of agility and list key\nelements that must be in place for its achievement. For example, Christopher (2000, p. 37)\nstates that \u201cAgility is a business-wide capability that embraces organizational structures,\ninformation systems, logistics processes, and, in particular, mindsets. A key characteristic of\nan agile organization is flexibility.\u201d This latter definition of agility introduces the term\n4flexibility and these terms are often used interchangeably. However, in general, flexibility\ntends to be used at a lower (e.g. operational) level and agility tends to be used at a much more\nencompassing (e.g. business wide) level, for example by van Hoek (2001).\nThe term agility is often compared with lean supply chain concepts. However, it is\ngenerally recognised that company supply chains normally need to encompass both concepts,\nas both cost and service are likely to be either a market qualifier or a market winner (Mason-\nJones et al. 2000). Indeed, hybrid approaches to supply chains may well be applicable, as\nexplored by Christopher and Towill (2001).\nThe required capabilities for agile supply chains have been developed in a number of\nareas, but these mainly relate to organisational and information-based aspects, for example,\nvirtual teaming (Bal et al. 1999) and information lead-times (Mason-Jones and Towill 1999).\nThe competencies and resources required for agility at the operational level in supply chains,\nsuch as at the distribution centre level, have not yet been examined in depth.\nAnother categorisation used to define supply chain agility has been to divide this concept\ninto three elements: sourcing agility, manufacturing agility, and delivery agility (Prater et al.\n2001). Again, very little research has so far been conducted in the latter area, within which\nthis paper is placed.\n3 Distribution centres within agile supply chains\nThere has been a trend towards goods moving through distribution centres rather than being\nstored in them, thus, becoming \u201cswitching yards\u201d rather than \u201cholding yards\u201d (Drucker 1992).\n5This is regarded as a key part of agility in warehousing, for example by using end consumer\ndemand to drive replenishment throughout the supply chain (Christopher 2005). A prime role\nof warehouses in agile supply chains has been viewed as cross docking and in-transit merging\n(van Hoek 2001). This cross docking (i.e. receiving and dispatching goods without putting\naway into storage) may be between warehouses at different levels in the supply chain, as in\nthe case of local transhipment depots receiving goods from national distribution centres, or\nmay be between warehouses at the same echelon level, as in the case of sharing inventory\nbetween regional distribution centres (Herer et al. 2002).\nHowever, inventory still plays a key role in most supply chains. For example, although\ninventory in the manufacturing, wholesaling and retail sectors in the UK has declined as a\nratio of turnover, it still represents on average between 3 and 5.5 weeks of sales in each of\nthese sectors (Office for National Statistics 2005). In the USA, the overall ratio of inventory\nto sales has been reported as being static (Frazelle 2002a), whilst a study for the Warehouse\nEducation and Research Council (WERC) has noted that warehouses are being opened to\nhandle imports as part of global supply lines (Maltz and DeHoratius 2004). This latter report\nalso noted the consolidation of stockholding points that is occurring.\nWithin the agile supply chain literature, it has been noted that it is necessary to locate\ninventory and capacity at strategic points to facilitate the flow of goods through the supply\nchain, particularly as a result of the growth of product innovation and demand uncertainty\n(Stratton and Warburton 2003). The increasing globalisation of supply chains also result in\nthe need to hold increased inventories due to long, and less certain, lead times (Harrison and\nvan Hoek 2005).\n6These strategic inventory holdings are often termed \u201cdecoupling points\u201d, as they enable\nlean production to take place based on reasonably level output levels, separated from a\ndownstream agile supply chain serving volatile market places (Naylor et al. 1999). These\ndecoupling points may be at various levels in the supply chain, for example near the source of\nsupply or the point of demand, depending on the supply chain characteristics, for example\n\u201cmake to stock\u201d or \u201cship to stock\u201d (Childerhouse and Towill 2000).\nThe requirement for decoupling points, the trend towards inventory consolidation, and\nthe need for cross-docking and merging facilities all lead to the establishment of distribution\ncentres, many of which need to be substantial in size to fulfil their roles.\n4 The design of distribution centres\nThe design of distribution centres is normally described as a series of steps based on\nforecasted demand (e.g. Rushton et al. 2000 and Hassan 2002), with the objective of\nidentifying the most efficient design for the planning horizon. These broad steps have been\nsupported by an ethnographic study of actual warehouse designs by Bodner et al. (2002), who\nproposed a decision support architecture that could act as a basis for future development. The\nincorporation of flexibility may be regarded as implicit in these steps but no specific\nconceptual tools are presented. This has been partly addressed by Rowley (2000, p.4) who\nadded a final step of \u201ccomputer simulation of the proposed warehouse with different volumes\nand the consequences on the rest of the supply chain\u201d. However, this step does not address\nhow to incorporate flexibility into the actual design process.\n7The warehouse design process is recognised as being complex with multiple objectives\nand with a very large set of alternatives that is often impossible to optimise in practice\n(Rouwenhurst et al. 2000). The elements to be considered in the final design (taken from the\nreferences in this section) include:\n\uf0a7 Building design: including features such as height, floor flatness and strength, climate\ncontrol, sprinklers, fire walls and exits, and goods in\/out doors.\n\uf0a7 Equipment: including storage and handling equipment, ranging from automated\nequipment such as sortation systems through to more labour intensive equipment\ntypes, such as picking trolleys.\n\uf0a7 Staffing: considerations include the use of permanent and temporary staff, multi-\nskilling, ergonomics, and health and safety issues.\n\uf0a7 Systems: including the functionality of warehouse management systems (WMS) and\nequipment control systems, needed to support the planned operation.\n\uf0a7 Process design: processes are required to support the various warehouse functions of\nreceiving, storage (or cross-docking), picking, added value services, marshalling and\ndespatch.\nThe consequences of not building in flexibility into these design features can be dramatic,\nas exemplified by a study of e-fulfilment operations which concluded that the \u201csuggested\ndesign may make or break an e-commerce fulfilment center\u201d (Tarn et al. 2003, p.361).\n5 Model development\nThis paper follows a general framework that has previously been used for agile supply chain\nresearch, as presented by van Hoek et al. (2001). This comprises:\n8\uf0a7 Identifying the concept being examined (i.e. agility);\n\uf0a7 Defining the scope or setting (in this case distribution centre design);\n\uf0a7 Identifying the capabilities required at the operational level;\n\uf0a7 Measuring by means of an audit or assessment;\n\uf0a7 Presenting the operational challenges that are faced.\nThe broad concept of agility has been defined in the preceding sections, but, more\nspecifically, this research focuses on the design characteristics that are used to respond to\nparticular facets of agility. Three main facets of agility have been identified by van Hoek\n(2001), namely:\n\uf0b7 Volume variance, including that caused by seasonality, product life cycles and end\nconsumer demand fluctuations.\n\uf0b7 Time variance, for example urgent orders.\n\uf0b7 Quantity variance, for example orders at item, rather than case, level.\nThese concern the informational flows (e.g. customised information) as well as the\nphysical flows, and may relate to the ability to respond to variances in inbound shipments as\nwell as to variances in market demands. These definitions of agility types were used as a\nbasis for the research, and were developed further during the interview process.\nIn order to be able to succeed in volatile market places, companies need to develop the\nflexible capabilities that are critical to their customers and support these with flexible\ncompetencies, which may include for example internal processes and infrastructure (Zhang et\n9al. 2002). These capabilities and competencies span the whole value chain, but the scope for\nthis research is focussed on that provided at the distribution centre level. This is akin to the\nframework set out for examining manufacturing flexibility that involves a hierarchy from\nstrategic business unit level through to individual machine level (Koste and Malhotra 1999).\nAt the level of the distribution centre, the necessary resources include space, materials\nhandling equipment, labour and information systems, as well as the integration of these\nresources, in terms of processes (Frazelle 2002b). These are the resource categories used in\nthis research.\nMany of these resources require long development times (e.g. bespoke warehouse\nmanagement systems) and long asset lives (e.g. high bay automated warehouses). They may\nthus provide a sustainable competitive advantage to a firm by meeting the criteria of being\nvaluable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable (Barney 1991), in line with the literature on\nthe resource-based view of the firm.\nFlexibility has been measured in manufacturing along three dimensions (Upton 1994) and\nthese can be amended for distribution centre analysis as follows:\n\uf0b7 Range, i.e. the types of agility offered, as described above, and the extent to which\neach type of variance can be accommodated. For example, a distribution centre may\nbe agile in that it can respond to urgent orders but may not be able to accommodate\nwide variations in volume throughput.\n\uf0b7 Mobility, i.e. the ease with which the distribution centre can move between these, in\nterms of cost and time. For example, Prater et al. (2001) define agility as the ability to\nrespond within a useful timeframe, and thus the speed of adjustment is critical.\n10\n\uf0b7 Uniformity, i.e. achieving constant performance and service levels whilst being\nflexible. Agility focuses on customer service, and thus it would generally not be\nacceptable to provide a capability to be able to respond rapidly to the range of\nvariances that may occur at the expense of such service features as accuracy or order\ncompletion.\nThe combined literature in the areas of supply chain agility, resource based view of the\nfirm, manufacturing flexibility and warehousing thus provides a number of approaches for\nexamining flexible design features within distribution centres. These approaches are used in\nthis paper to explore how distribution centres are being designed to meet the agile\nrequirements of volatile market places, and to present a framework that may be of assistance\nto practitioners in meeting the challenges faced in the field.\n6 Research design\nThe research was based on semi-structured interviews with six warehouse design companies,\nranging from large multi-national companies with their own equipment manufacturing\ncapabilities to small\/medium sized independent warehouse design companies. The companies\ninterviewed were: Clayden Consulting, FKI Logistex, Jigsaw Logistics, Jungheinrich,\nSiemens and Total Logistics. Each company was interviewed concerning the design of\ndistribution centres that formed part of international supply chains.\nIn total, these comprised two Global Distribution Centres, six European Distribution\nCentres and three National Distribution Centres. The latter were all parts of inward\ninternational supply chains, serving a national market. The distribution centres were located\n11\nin the UK (6 in number), Belgium (2), the Netherlands (1), Spain (1) and South Korea (1).\nThe industries covered were clothing\/footwear (4), electrical\/electronics (3), furniture (1),\npaper (1), pharmaceuticals (1) and machine parts for the aftermarket (1). Five distribution\ncentres were operated by (or on behalf of) manufacturers, three by wholesalers, and three by\nretailers. All of the distribution centres were over 10,000 m2 in floor area, with the largest\nbeing 170,000 m2. The heights varied from 10m to 30m, with six of the distribution centres\nhaving high-bay areas over 20m in height.\nEach interviewee was asked to identify the degree of agility that was perceived as being\nrequired for the distribution centre in question. This was based on the three basic types of\nagility identified by van Hoek (2001) and expanded to include other aspects mentioned during\nthe interviews. The interviewees were asked to provide the degree of agility required for each\ntype of agility on a 5-point Likert scale.\nWhere scores of 3 or more (i.e. \u201caverage requirement\u201d or above) were given, the\ninterviewees were then asked to describe how they had planned for that particular type of\nagility. The answers were categorised under the headings of land\/buildings, equipment,\nstaffing, process and systems.\nFor each answer, the interviewees were then asked to give their opinion as to the impact\nof the planned measure on:\n\uf0b7 Capital cost (i.e. whether the design of an agile capability had cost more in capital\nterms). This was measured on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from a \u201c3\u201d for a\nsignificant variation (i.e. a much higher capital cost), a \u201c0\u201d for no impact, to a \u201c-3\u201d for\n12\na significant improvement (i.e. a much lower capital cost). This allowed for variations\nin both directions. The aim was to provide a qualitative assessment of the different\nmeasures, so no figures were collected. However, in discussions, a guideline of 0-\n10% was used for \u201cslightly higher costs\u201d, 10-25% for \u201cmoderately higher costs\u201d and\nover 25% for \u201cmuch higher costs\u201d. These were applied to the individual building,\nequipment, staffing, or systems costs in question.\n\uf0b7 Operating cost (i.e. whether it would cost more in terms of annual operating costs).\nThis was measured in the same way as capital cost.\n\uf0b7 Mobility (i.e. how quickly it could respond to the variance in question). For this\nmeasure, a reduced range, from \u201c3\u201d for long-term to \u201c0\u201d for immediate was used (as\nnegative figures would have been meaningless). The guidelines were zero time for\nimmediate availability, up to 3 weeks for \u201cshort term\u201d, 3 weeks to 3 months for\n\u201cmedium term\u201d, and over 3 months for \u201clong term\u201d.\n\uf0b7 Uniformity (i.e. whether the customer service level would be maintained during this\nresponse). This was measured on a 7-point Likert scale. No quantitative guidelines\nwere provided with regard to service levels owing to the multitude of parameters that\ncompanies measure. The service level results are therefore the subjective views of the\ninterviewees, ranging from \u201c3\u201d for significant worsening of service levels to \u201c-3\u201d for\nsignificant improvement, compared to the levels experienced outside the period of\nvariance in question.\n7 Results\n13\nThe different types of agility are explored first of all and then the ways in which the designers\nactually responded to each agility type are identified.\n7.1 Agility types\nThe results for the degree of agility perceived as being required by the warehouse designers\nfor each distribution centre are set out in table 1. These represent to what extent the designers\nconsciously tried to make the distribution centre agile in each respect.\n[Insert table 1 about here]\nFor all eleven distribution centres at least one type of agility was considered to be\n\u201cimportant\u201d during the design process, whilst eight of the eleven involved an agility type that\nwas considered \u201cvery important\u201d. The distribution centres covered in the research represented\nall agility types at least to an \u201caverage\u201d level and therefore all agility types were investigated\nfurther, although the number of interviews for each agility type varied between 3 and 10, as\nset out in the right hand column of table 1. Some agility types are thus represented more fully\nthan others within this exploratory research.\nThe ability to be able to respond to variances in volume is well represented across the\ndistribution centres, particularly with regard to growth, demand variance, and product life\ncycles. In fact, the capability to react to higher growth than anticipated was regarded as \u201cvery\nimportant\u201d in 8 of the 11 distribution centre designs, and this aspect had the highest Likert\nscore overall, with an average of 4.3. It should be noted that some of these sub-categories\n(e.g. growth) relate to total volume through the distribution centre, whilst others (e.g.\n14\npromotions) relate to product mix variations. Some (e.g. seasonality and demand variance)\nmay be a combination of both.\nResponsiveness in terms of time was \u201cimportant\u201d for five of the distribution centres,\nalthough many are already operating a next day service level and therefore \u201crush orders\u201d were\nconsidered the norm.\nThe ability to respond to different unit quantities (e.g. by allowing for variations in\ndifferent order profiles from case to item quantities) was well represented in the distribution\ncentres researched, although generally only at an \u201caverage\u201d level. However, this aspect was\nconsidered \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cvery important\u201d in three of the designs\nThe categories of presentation and information were added to the list of agility types as a\nresult of interview responses. Variances in presentation included for example the requirement\nto deliver different height pallets to some customers, whilst variances in information included\nthe need to print labels, or send EDI messages, containing customer specific data fields.\nOn the inbound side, some of the distribution centres were seen as needing to respond to\nunplanned variations in deliveries from suppliers, particularly in terms of delivery volumes,\ntimes, presentation and information. Variable return characteristics were an issue for four of\nthe distribution centre designs.\nThe requirements to be able to handle variances in unpredictable future growth, demand\nvariance, product life cycles and unit quantities were regarded by the designers as being the\n15\nmost important for the distribution centres in question and therefore the responses to these\nagility types are examined further in this paper.\n7.2 Potential growth\nThe interview results for the nine distribution centres where potential growth was considered\nto be an \u201caverage\u201d, \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cvery important\u201d aspect are set out in table 2. The two\nmain ways in which the designers planned to accommodate potential growth were to provide\nextra land \/ buildings (for 6 of the 9 centres in the case of extra floor area) and to provide\nextra equipment (at 7 of the 9 centres). Extra land \/ buildings were viewed as being a slight to\nmoderate increased cost, either as capital costs if purchased or as an operating cost if leased.\nExtra land would obviously need longer to convert to accommodate growth than an existing\nbuilding. Extra floor area was immediately available for certain functions, such as block\nstorage, but would need a medium to long term period for equipment installation. Extra\nheight was often provided, normally to provide space for an additional level of mezzanine for\nexpansion. The design of the building for modular expansion was seen as being necessary for\nsome of the above features and this involved little extra cost in itself.\n[Insert table 2 about here]\nThe provision of extra equipment capacity (e.g. on conveyors) was seen as slightly higher\ncapital cost, but with no other implications. In particular, this method was immediately\navailable to handle extra volume. A second approach, with even less initial capital cost\nimplications, was to use equipment that could easily be upgraded (e.g. from manually\noperated cranes to automated cranes). This could eventually improve service levels at the\n16\ntime of upgrade (e.g. in terms of accuracy and damage levels). A third equipment approach\nwas to use simpler equipment types (e.g. narrow aisle trucks or curve growing cranes) that\ncould easily be added to if growth occurred. This often involved lower capital costs but\nhigher operating costs, than more automated equipment.\nFor two of the distribution centres, the location near a readily available pool of labour\nwas seen as important for the future recruitment of staff, should rapid growth occur. These\ntwo warehouses were deliberately located away from the traditional distribution \u201chot spots\u201d.\n7.3 Demand variance\nThe most common way to design for demand variance was to provide extra equipment\ncapacity (in 7 out of the 8 distribution centres relating to this type of variance), often\ncombined with one or more flexible staffing solutions \u2013 either by means of flexible hours for\nexisting staff or by employing agency staff (see table 3).\n[Insert table 3 about here]\nExamples of the extra equipment capacity included the capability of miniload (i.e.\nautomated storage and retrieval systems for bins or cartons) to work well beyond average\nthroughput levels, and the provision of extra pick and pack stations (to accommodate extra\ntemporary staff). The provision of extra equipment capacity had a slight to medium capital\ncost implication, but was immediately available to handle variances and was viewed as doing\nthis without any deterioration in service. One distribution centre involved the design of a\npicking system specifically for later expansion and this involved a slight increase in capital\n17\ncost and a significant time delay in becoming available, if needed. A complementary\napproach at the same centre included the design of a sorter for flexible routing, which also\ninvolved a slight increase in capital cost but is available immediately.\nAll of the staffing options involved a slightly higher operating cost (e.g. owing to the\nhigher wage rates associated with flexible hours or the higher rates of agency staff). A short\ntime lag was generally necessary to arrange the extra staffing. Also, the use of non-permanent\nstaff (i.e. part-time and agency staff) tended to lead to a deterioration in service level. In fact,\nstaffing solutions to agility were the only areas that recorded a possible service level drop\nwhilst handling the various types of variance in the study.\nOne interesting response to demand variability was to change the order picking process.\nThe extra volumes at peak made it more cost effective to pick-to-order rather than to bulk\npick. The optimum order picking process is generally a trade-off between efficient picking\n(as in bulk picking) and the avoidance of sortation (as in pick-to-order). The strategy was\nthus varied in line with order volume changes (i.e. being higher at peak compared to average\nthroughput levels) leading to operating cost benefits.\n7.4 Life-cycle variance\nWith life-cycle variances the total volumes passing through a warehouse may be constant but\nthe product mix may change dramatically. For example, this could be due to catalogue\nchanges or to rapid rates of obsolescence (as with many electronic items). In 5 of the 7\ndistribution centres relating to this variance, the accommodation of life-cycle variances\nresulted in extra equipment being planned (e.g. so that new pick faces could be opened for\n18\nnew product introductions). This normally led to higher capital and operating costs, but was\navailable in a very short time-span (see table 4).\n[Insert table 4 about here]\nThere was a range of other solutions used. Those that involved staffing had similar\ncharacteristics (in terms of cost, mobility and uniformity) to the staffing solutions described\nunder demand variance above. Four distribution centres incorporated process or system\nimprovements, to identify the life-cycle changes rapidly or to support the operation. These\noften had a cost implication. In one instance, the capital cost in bespoke software was\nregarded as being high, although operating costs and service levels were seen as benefiting\nfrom this investment.\n7.5 Unit quantity variance\nUnit quantity variance had an average Likert score of just above average (i.e. 3.2) but was a\nfactor, at least at an \u201caverage\u201d level, in 10 out of the 11 distribution centre designs. It was\ngenerally addressed in terms of equipment, by designing separate work-streams for item, case\nand pallet flows, as shown in table 5. For these 7 distribution centres, extra capacity was\nprovided in all relevant areas of equipment to be able to handle potential peak workloads\nwithin each stream. This involved slight to moderate capital cost, but was also seen as\nproviding operating cost efficiencies.\n[Insert table 5 about here]\n19\nIn four distribution centres, specific equipment types were incorporated into the design to\nprovide flexibility. These were generally less automated types (e.g. manually operated\npicking cranes), with lower capital costs but higher operating costs. One designer pointed out\nthat staff flexibility was required to be able to achieve this responsiveness between work-\nstreams (and that there was a training cost to this). Agility in this area incurred extra\ndevelopment costs for the computer systems in two instances (e.g. to recognise individual\nitems, as well as cases and pallets).\nUnder all of these designs, the ability to respond to unit quantity variance was immediate\nand there was no anticipated reduction in service levels.\n7.6 Results for other agility types\nThe above results just show four of the main categories of agility identified during the\nresearch. The results for all the agility types indicate that each category of agility is addressed\nby using a different mix of resources. For example, process and systems solutions were\nparticularly important for the handling of time variance (e.g. rush orders), whilst staffing and\nequipment solutions were predominant for responding to seasonality.\n7.7 Consolidated results\nAcross all of the agility types, the most common resource option employed to respond to\nfuture variance involved the use of equipment: 64 of the 141 instances (an instance being\ndefined as one solution identified for one distribution centre). This was followed by\ninformation systems (26 instances), buildings (21) and staffing (20). Although warehouse\n20\ndesign companies have an overall view of the how the future distribution centre should\noperate, the predominance of equipment may well reflect their prime area of responsibility\nand therefore the results should be regarded in that light. Further research would therefore be\nuseful to examine the views of other participants in the design process (e.g. operational\nmanagement, information systems management, and construction companies).\nAnother form of categorisation that could be superimposed on these response categories is\nthat agility can be satisfied by:\n\uf0a7 Providing extra capacity (e.g. additional floor area in the warehouse, or extra sortation\nmachine capacity).\n\uf0a7 Using additional resources when needed (e.g. temporary staff, or the upgrading of\nequipment).\n\uf0a7 Employing flexible resources (e.g. staff on flexible hours, conveyors that can easily\nbe rerouted, or software functionality that can be switched on and off as required).\nOut of the total 141 instances recorded, 61 related to extra capacity (chiefly in relation to\nequipment and buildings), 23 to the use of additional resources (chiefly staff and equipment),\nand 57 to flexible resources (chiefly systems and equipment). The results for these different\nsets of categorisation are shown in table 6.\n[Insert table 6 about here]\nThese different response categories have different implications in terms of capital and\noperating costs, as set out in table 7. The provision of extra capacity in terms of land,\n21\nbuildings, equipment and systems was regarded as incurring \u201cslightly\u201d to \u201cmoderately\u201d higher\ncapital costs, whilst extra staffing is reflected in higher operating costs. The design for\nadditional building and equipment resources when needed was regarded as involving very\nslight increased capital costs. The only negative figure is for the use of flexible equipment,\nwhich was seen as less capital intensive, although incurring relatively higher operating costs\n(e.g. the use of a manual, rather than an automated, picking regime).\n[Insert table 7 about here]\nThe mobility of resources also varied by response category, as shown in table 8.\nInvestment in extra land and the construction of additional buildings, on that land, were\nregarded as the longest response periods, whilst the provision of extra capacities for\nequipment, staff, and systems were regarded as being almost instantaneously available.\n[Insert table 8 about here]\nThe uniformity (i.e. service) implications are shown in table 9. The negative figures refer\nto perceptions of improved service levels being provided. For example, one solution related\nto designing for the upgrade to a more automated solution when needed, which was viewed as\nimproving accuracy when that occurred. A potential detrimental impact on service levels was\nseen as the use of additional staff resources to handle variances.\n[Insert table 9 about here]\n22\nThe use of flexible resources reflects the \u201cessence\u201d of the aspirational ideal of agility and\n(with the exception of the capital cost of flexible systems solutions) these responses\nrepresented a way of handling variances with less than \u201cslightly\u201d increased costs (i.e. less than\n+10%), in a very \u201cshort\u201d time frame (i.e. less than 3 weeks), and with no detriment to service\nlevels. However, it should be noted that the use of flexible resources generally offers a way\nto cope with variability in mix, rather than in total volume. For changes in total volume, the\nuse of excess capacity or additional resources is required. The former method generally\ninvolves higher capital costs, whereas the latter method takes longer to deploy.\n8 Conclusions\nThe results largely substantiate the propositions put forward by Suarez et al. (1996, p.225) in\nrelation to manufacturing flexibility, namely:\n\uf0a7 \u201cDifferent types of flexibility exist and are important to firms in different competitive\nsituations.\u201d (This research indicates that different types of flexibility exist and are\nimportant to the distribution centres of different firms).\n\uf0a7 \u201cThere are different ways of achieving each type of flexibility.\u201d (This research has\nalso shown that some ways are common across different types of flexibility).\n\uf0a7 \u201cDifferent approaches to flexibility may have different costs and tradeoffs\u2026\u201d (This\nhas been found in relation to capital costs, operating costs, mobility, and uniformity).\nWhilst the question of agility needs to be addressed in overall supply chain terms (for\nexample, by improving visibility and communication), the design of distribution centres can\nbe a critical part of this. It is recognised that a mix of strategies needs to be adopted to\n23\nbecome agile (e.g. Power et al. 2001) and this research reinforces that is also the case at the\ndistribution centre level.\nThe challenge to warehouse designers is how to provide for agility whilst containing\ncosts, providing a rapid response mechanism, and doing this without compromising customer\nservice levels. The results have validated the agility types and the response categories\ndeveloped in the research design, in as far as all the responses for these particular distribution\ncentres could be classified within the framework that was devised.\nAs the agility type, range, mobility and uniformity can be specified as requirements at the\noutset of warehouse design (i.e. as requirements of the supply chain as a whole), then a\nwarehouse design methodology can be developed starting with these elements. In line with\nthe framework developed for this research, the next step would be to identify the resource\noptions (e.g. equipment and staffing) that can meet the required agility types and then\nconsider the alternative approaches to each of these (e.g. extra capacity or use of additional\nresources). These would need to be evaluated to ensure that they meet the range, mobility,\nand uniformity requirements, and, if so, the costs would then be calculated. Based on this\ninformation, the most appropriate agile approach could be adopted. This methodology is\nshown in figure 1.\n[Insert figure 1 about here]\nIn general, there is often an increased cost to design for agility, although this is only\nperceived as being \u201cslight\u201d to \u201cmoderate\u201d. The nature of this cost may be in terms of a\nhigher capital cost (e.g. over specification) or higher operating cost (e.g. for a manual rather\n24\nthan automated solution). The time needed to respond to variances depends on the nature of\nthe design feature (e.g. ranging from the construction periods needed for building on extra\nland to the immediate availability of spare conveyor capacity). Generally, there is no\nperceived service level deterioration in handling agile responses within the design parameters,\nunless the use of temporary staff is planned. In fact, there are instances of anticipated service\nlevel benefits in some cases (e.g. where the ability to be able to respond to different unit\nquantities can be associated with the improved presentation of the goods to the customer).\nThis research provides a framework for considering agility in the design phase and is thus\nintended to develop knowledge in this area. It is intended to be of direct relevance to supply\nchain practitioners, as the methodology proposed could be used during the warehouse design\nprocess. The case study content provides an initial checklist of agile approaches, together\nwith their cost, time and service implications. Further research is required to develop this\nframework and checklist more fully, and to extend this work into the actual operation of the\ndistribution centres and to other aspects of the supply chain. In this way, a comprehensive\napproach to agility can be developed to incorporate the operational competencies and\nresources that are needed to provide the wider supply chain capabilities being sought. Such a\nframework would be a useful step to assist organisations that serve volatile markets to fulfil\ntheir agile aspirations.\nReferences\nAllen, N., Upping the stakes.
