Cosmic radio noise absorption (CNA) events as-\nsociated with equatorward drifting arcs during a substorm\ngrowth phase are studied by using simultaneous optical au-\nroral, IRIS imaging riometer and EISCAT incoherent scatter\nradar measurements. The CNA is generally attributed to en-\nergetic particle precipitation in the D-region. However, it has\nbeen argued that plasma irregularities or enhanced electron\ntemperature (Te) in the E-region could also produce CNA.\nBoth of the latter mechanisms are related to intense electric\nfields in the ionosphere. We present two events which occur\nduring a substorm growth phase in the evening MLT sector.\nIn both of the events, an auroral arc is drifting equatorward,\ntogether with a region of CNA (auroral absorption bay) lo-\ncated on the equatorward side and outside of the arc. Both\nof the events are associated with enhanced D-region elec-\ntron density on the equatorward side of the auroral arc, but\nin the second event, a region of intense electric field and en-\nhanced electron temperature in the E-region is also located\non the equatorward side of the arc. We show that in the stud-\nied events neither plasma instabilities nor enhanced Te play\na significant role in producing the measured CNA, but the\nCNA in the vicinity of the equatorward drifting arcs is pro-\nduced by D-region energetic electron precipitation.\nKey words. Ionosphere (auroral ionosphere; particle precip-\nitation; electric fields and currents)\n1 Introduction\nThe height-integrated ionospheric attenuation of high fre-\nquency cosmic radio waves, i.e. cosmic radio noise absorp-\ntion (CNA) is measured by riometers operating in the fre-\nquency range of 20\u201350 MHz. Under disturbed conditions\nthe CNA is generally attributed to the enhancement of D-\nregion ionization produced by particle precipitation. The D-\nregion can be ionized by energetic electrons (\u226530 keV) or\nCorrespondence to: J. R. T. Jussila\n(jouni.jussila@oulu.fi)\nprotons of MeV range. It has also been suggested that CNA\ncould be produced in the E-region by plasma irregularities\n(D\u2019Angelo, 1976) or by an enhanced electron temperature\n(Stauning, 1984). Both of these E-region mechanisms are\nrelated to strong ionospheric electric fields.\nThe aim of this paper is to study the relative importance\nof the conventional D-region precipitation and the proposed\nE-region processes producing CNA in the vicinity of quiet\nauroral arcs occurring during a substorm growth phase.\nIt is well known that auroral arcs are drifting equatorward\nduring the growth phase of a substorm. The development of\nauroral absorption substorms has been studied in several pa-\npers (Hargreaves et al., 1975; Pytte et al., 1976; Ranta et al.,\n1981; Pellinen et al., 1982; Ranta and Ranta, 1984; Ranta\net al., 1999). Studies show a pre-onset absorption bay that\noften precedes an onset of a substorm. The absorption bay\nis extended in the east-west direction, moves slowly equator-\nward and is typically 50\u2013100 km wide latitudinally. Optical\ndata has very seldom been available in absorption studies.\nThe study by Pellinen et al. (1982) showed that the maxi-\nmum of CNA was located on the equatorward side of the\ngrowth phase auroral arc. Also, many studies have utilized\nwide-beam riometer antennas, and, therefore, it has not been\npossible to determine the extent of the actual absorption area\nwith a high accuracy. Stoker et al. (1997) studied the rela-\ntionship of CNA and discrete auroral arcs or pulsating auroral\npatches by an imaging riometer during disturbed conditions\nand they concluded that the CNA occurred adjacent to the\nauroral forms.\nSergeev et al. (1990) proposed that the observed CNA dur-\ning a substorm growth phase was due to pitch-angle scatter-\ning of energetic electrons in the equatorial current sheet and\nthe equatorward movement of the CNA region was due to\nconfiguration changes in the magnetotail. On the other hand,\nWilliams et al. (1990), Opgenoorth et al. (1990), Aikio et al.\n(1993) and Aikio et al. (2002) have shown that an enhanced\nmeridional electric field and an accompanying enhanced E-\nregion electron temperature are often observed outside of an\nauroral arc, on the equatorward side of an eveningside arc. In\n1676 J. R. T. Jussila et al.: CNA event associated with growth phase auroral arcs\naddition, there is evidence that CNA can occur outside of an\narc and that the enhanced electric field associated with drift-\ning quiet arc is also located outside of the arc. Our aim is\nto study whether these two phenomena (CNA and enhanced\nelectric field) are related causally.\nWe have looked for events of equatorward drifting quiet\ngrowth phase arcs with simultaneous measurements of 1) au-\nroras by the Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (KIL) all-sky camera (ASC), 2) CNA\nby the IRIS imaging riometer at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi and 3) plasma\nparameters (Ne, Te, Ti and E) by the EISCAT incoherent\nscatter facility in Troms\u00f8 within the field-of-view (fov) of\nboth the KIL ASC and IRIS. We selected two good events: 7\nDecember 1999 and 8 April 1998. In the latter event the au-\nroral arc is associated with a region of enhanced electric field\nand increased Te in the E-region on the equatorward side of\nthe arc, as discussed by Aikio et al. (2002).\nFor these events, the CNA measured by IRIS will be com-\npared to the CNA calculated from the EISCAT data using the\nequation of the conventional nondeviative absorption. This\nequation is formulated mainly for D-region absorption phe-\nnomena and if E-region instabilities play a major role, the\ncalculated CNA should be significantly less than the mea-\nsured one.\n2 Measurements\n2.1 Instrumentation\nThe CNA was measured by the IRIS (Imaging Riometer for\nIonospheric Studies) system, which is located at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi\n(69.05\u25e6 N, 20.79\u25e6 E). IRIS consists of 49 (7\u00d77) narrow\nbeams with widths between 13\u25e6 and 16\u25e6, and it operates at\na frequency of 38.2 MHz (Browne et al., 1995). The basic\ntime resolution is 1 s, but in this study we have used integra-\ntion times of 10 s. The calculated absorption was mapped to\nthe altitude of 80 km in both events, and the data was interpo-\nlated to produce a grid comprising 67.8\u201370.2\u25e6 N and 17.75\u2013\n23.75\u25e6 E, with a resolution of 0.1\u25e6 N\u00d70.25\u25e6 E.\nAuroras were recorded by an all-sky camera of the MIR-\nACLE network (Syrja\u00a8suo et al., 1998) at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi. The\nIRIS fov is located inside that of the ASC. The wavelength\nof 557.7 nm originating from the O1S emission was used for\nthe interference filter of the ASC. The time resolution of the\nASC during both of the events was 20 s. The exposure time\nof each image was 1 s. ASC images were mapped to the ge-\nographical grid by assuming the lower border of auroras at\n100 km (Event 1) or 120 km (Event 2).\nThe EISCAT (European Incoherent SCATter radar) UHF-\nradar (Risbeth and van Eyken, 1993) was measuring during\nboth of the events in the CP-1 magnetic field-aligned mode.\nThe basic time resolution of the data was 5 s, but the data\nwere post-integrated to 60 or 120 s resolution. The altitude\nresolution of the data used was 3 km. The CP-1 experiment\ncontained several pulse codes: long pulses, alternating codes\nand power profiles. The use of EISCAT data is explained in\nmore detail in the following section.\n2.2 Method to calculate the CNA from EISCAT measure-\nments\nThe nondeviative absorption of a vertically incident radio\nwave is given, for example, by Hargreaves (1992)\nA(db) = 4.6 \u00b7 10\u22125\n\u222b\nh\nNe\u03bden\n\u03bd2en + (\u03c9 \u2212e)2\ndh , (1)\nwhere Ne is the electron density in m\u22123, \u03bden the electron-\nneutral collision frequency, \u03c9 the angular frequency of the\nradio wave and e the electron gyrofrequency.\nTo calculate the absorption with Eq. (1), the electron den-\nsity was obtained from the EISCAT measurement. The alter-\nnating code pulse scheme extended from 86 to 270 km (Event\n1) or to 191 km (Event 2), and it provided true electron densi-\nties. At lower heights, only the power profile data was avail-\nable. The relationship between the true electron density Ne\nand the so-called raw electron density Neraw provided by the\npower profiles is\nNe\nNeraw\n= 1\n2\n(1 + k2\u03bb2d)(1 +\nTe\nTi\n+ k2\u03bb2d), (2)\nwhere \u03bbd=(\u03b50kBTe\/Nee2)1\/2 is the Debye length and k is\nthe wave number of the EISCAT UHF-radar (\u03bb=0.322 m\u22121).\nIt can be seen that if the Debye term can be omitted and the\nelectron and ion temperatures are equal, then the raw and\ntrue electron densities are also equal. In order to make a\ncorrection for the raw electron density, we have estimated the\nDebye length by using the raw electron density as Ne and by\nassuming Te=Ti=Tn, which is usually a good approximation\nin the D- and lower E-region. The Tn profiles were obtained\nfrom the MSIS model (Hedin, 1991). Then the power profile\ndata, together with Eq. (2), was used to estimate Ne between\n70 and 86 km. The alternating code provided Ne between 86\nand 140 km.\nTo calculate the absorption, the electron-neutral collision\nfrequency profile was also needed and it was calculated by\n\u03bden = \u03bdeO + \u03bdeO2 + \u03bdeN2 (3)\n(Doe et al., 1995), where the individual collision frequencies\nfor atomic and molecular oxygen, and molecular nitrogen are\ngiven by\n\u03bdeO = 8.9\u00b710\u221217[O](1 + 0.00057\u00b7Te)\n\u221a\nTe (4)\n\u03bdeO2 = 1.8\u00b710\u221217[O2](1 + 0.036\u00b7Te)\n\u221a\nTe (5)\n\u03bdeN2 = 2.3\u00b710\u221217[N2](1 + 0.00012\u00b7Te)\n\u221a\nTe, (6)\nwhere the number densities of |O], [O2] and [N2] are taken\nfrom the MSIS model. The electron temperature for the\nheight region 100\u2013140 km was taken from the EISCAT mea-\nsurement and below this from MSIS, assuming Te=Tn. The\nelectron gyrofrequency was calculated by using the IGRF\nmagnetic field model for Troms\u00f8.\nJ. R. T. Jussila et al.: CNA event associated with growth phase auroral arcs 1677\nFig. 1. Kilpisja\u00a8rvi ASC data from nine selected times from Event 1 on 7 December 1999. The ASC images are shown in false colour,\nmapped to the longitude-latitude grid, assuming the height of 100 km for the structures. The auroral intensities are arbitrary and scaled from\nthe original 8-bit gray scale image. The studied arc can be seen from 19:48 UT onward, on the poleward side of the diffuse aurora. It drifts\nequatorward and reaches the EISCAT beam location (marked with magenta dot) at 19:54 UT. At 20:00 UT the second weak arc can be seen\nin the location of EISCAT.\nTo estimate how sensitive the results were to the\nelectron-neutral collision frequency profile selected, we\nalso calculated the absorption by using an equation\n\u03bden=5.8\u00b710\u221211NT 5\/6e from Gurevich (1978), where N is the\nneutral density from the MSIS model, but the difference was\nnegligible.\n3 Studied events\n3.1 Event 1, 7 December 1999\nThe first event occurred between 19:40 and 20:05 UT on 7\nDecember 1999 during a growth phase of a small substorm.\nSelected images of ASC and IRIS data from this event are\nshown in Figs. 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows the 557.7 nm emis-\nsion from the KIL ASC in geographic coordinates by assum-\ning an altitude of 100 km as the lower border of optical auro-\nras. The altitude was selected on the basis of EISCAT elec-\ntron density profiles. The location of EISCAT is marked with\na magenta dot. The optical data shows a wide region of dif-\nfuse aurora with a weak discrete arc at the poleward edge,\nwhich becomes visible at 19:48 UT. At the poleward hori-\nzon, more intense aurora exist. The weak arc and the diffuse\naurora drift slowly equatorward.

The middle\npanel shows the whole ASC image, mapped to the longitude-latitude grid, assuming the height of 100 km for the structures. The bottom\npanel shows the combined IRIS and ASC data.

The data shows a longitudinally stretched ab-\nsorption region, which drifts equatorward. The total width of\nthis region is all the time below 100 km, and the half-width is\nof the order of 50 km. The absorption region contains struc-\ntures changing with time, in agreement with the observations\nof pulsating absorption patches by Ranta et al. (1999). Fur-\nthermore, absorption shows intensity variations and it is the\nmost intense with a maximum value of 1 dB between 19:55\nand 19:59 UT, when the maximum of the CNA region is no\nlonger within the EISCAT beam (red circle in the figure).\nThe middle panel of Fig. 2 shows the ASC data in geo-\ngraphic coordinates from the same time intervals as the IRIS\ndata in top panel. Again, the structures are mapped to the\naltitude of 100 km. All auroral structures drift equatorward\nand the velocity of the studied arc is about 170 m s\u22121. The\n20:02 UT image shows the intensification of the arcs to the\neast of EISCAT and IRIS.\nThe bottom panel of Fig. 2 combines the IRIS and optical\nimages from the top and middle panels. Here the location\nof the arc at the poleward boundary of the diffuse aurora is\nshown by a red line.

Jussila et al.: CNA event associated with growth phase auroral arcs\nof the magnetic field lines is only 12\u25e6 at KIL, this correction\nwould account for a shift of the arc of only about 4 km to the\npoleward direction, which would not be visible in the figure,\nso that correction is omitted. The figure clearly demonstrates\nthat the absorption region is located on the equatorward side\nof the weak arc, within the same region as the weak diffuse\naurora.\nFigure 3 shows the EISCAT measurement and the mea-\nsured and calculated CNA. The top panel shows the elec-\ntron temperature from 100 to 140 km altitude. In the cal-\nculation the values of Te were used from the MSIS model\nfor the height range of 70\u2013100 km. The electron tempera-\nture remains rather small throughout the event, except for\n19:59\u201320:00 UT, on the poleward side of the studied arc at an\naltitude of about 110 km. We argue that the Te enhancement\nis not related to the studied arc but to the arc on the poleward\nside of it, since the analysis of the electric field shows that\nat this location the northward electric field reaches a value\nof 50 mV m\u22121 and thus that arc obeys the typical electro-\ndynamic pattern of some eveningside arcs (e.g. Aikio et al.,\n2002).\nThe second panel shows the raw electron density between\n70 and 86 km, and the electron density from the alternating\ncode between 86 and 140 km, as used in the calculation of the\nCNA. As explained in the previous section, the raw electron\ndensity was corrected for the Debye effect, which accounted\nfor a correction factor of the order of 1.1 for the density. The\ndiffuse aurora is visible as the electron density enhancement\nmainly between the 110 and 130 km altitude. The studied\narc is measured between 19:54\u201319:57 UT by EISCAT, and it\nis visible both as an electron density enhancement and as a\ndecrease of the lower edge down to 100 km. After 20:00 UT\nthere are small electron density enhancements within a broad\nrange of altitudes above 110 km, which are related to other\nauroral arcs drifting to the EISCAT beam. Between 19:45\nand 19:55 UT, on the equatorward side of the studied arc,\nthere are enhancements of electron density at lower altitudes,\nwith a maximum at about 83 km. They are obviously pro-\nduced by energetic electron precipitation.\nThe third panel shows the total intensity of the electric\nfield measured by EISCAT. The electric field is enhanced\nfrom 19:58 UT onward in the region of decreased electron\ndensity in the E-region poleward of the arc.\nThe bottom panel shows the calculated total absorption\nfrom the EISCAT data (red curve) and that measured by IRIS\n(blue curve) at the location of the EISCAT beam. The absorp-\ntion from EISCAT shows two peaks corresponding to the two\nstrong enhancements of electron densities between 80 and\n90 km. The IRIS data shows the same two peaks and an addi-\ntional middle peak at about 19:49 UT. These peaks reflect the\ntemporal and spatial variation in absorption. When analysing\nEISCAT data with a 20-s integration time, D-region elec-\ntron density values showed significant variations within one\nminute time, e.g. 19:49:00\u201319:49:20 UT, where a clear max-\nimum was obtained. Obviously, the D-region precipitation\nvaried in time and space and this, together with the nar-\nrow beam of EISCAT (0.6\u25e6) compared to the wide beam of\nIRIS (13\u25e6), resulted in the absence of a clear middle peak\nfrom the calculated CNA. During 19:50\u201319:53 UT, CNA was\nsmall throughout the IRIS fov and after 19:56 UT absorp-\ntion reached its maximum value, but since the region of CNA\nhad drifted away from the EISCAT beam, it is not visible in\nFig. 3. It can be further noticed that during the time interval\nof high E-region Te, 19:59\u201320:00 UT, the CNA produced be-\ntween 100 and 120 km is only 0.006 dB. The two curves show\nclearly the same characteristics with similar background ab-\nsorption values. The measured CNA values are larger than\nthe calculated ones, but the difference is rather small, with\na mean value of 0.1 dB (average over 19:44\u201320:00 UT). The\npossible reasons for this difference are discussed in Sect. 4.\nFigure 4 shows altitude profiles of electron density, elec-\ntron temperature, electron-neutral collision frequency and in-\ncremental absorption (absorption per unit height), calculated\nfrom the EISCAT data at the first peak of CNA in Fig. 3,\n19:46\u201319:47 UT. Absorption is produced below 90 km with\na maximum close to 81 km, close to the maximum of the D-\nregion electron density, which is located at 87 km altitude.\n3.2 Event 2, 8 April 1998\nThe second event occurred between 19:45 and 20:20 UT on 8\nApril 1998, also during a growth phase of a small substorm.\nFigure 5 shows IRIS and optical data in the same format as\nFig. 2 but now the auroral arc has been mapped to 120 km, as\ndeduced by the EISCAT data. The top panel shows again a\nregion of east-west elongated and patchy CNA drifting equa-\ntorward. The absorption area is slightly wider than in Event\n1, the total width exceeds 120 km and the half-width is about\n60 km. In this case the CNA is very weak, with a maximum\nvalue of about 0.3 dB. The all-sky camera was switched on\nat 20:11 UT, just prior to a faint discrete arc which drifted to\nthe beam of EISCAT. The arc continued to drift equatorward\nuntil the substorm onset at 20:20 UT, when the arc intensified\nand a fold developed in the arc. The average drift speed of\nthe arc was 120 m s\u22121, and the width of the arc was 15 km\n(Aikio et al., 2002). Again, the region of CNA was located\non the equatorward side of the arc, which can be seen from\nthe bottom panel.\nFigure 6 shows EISCAT and IRIS data in the same format\nas Fig. 3. Electron temperature (top panel) shows a signifi-\ncant enhancement centered at 110 km just on the equatorward\nside of the arc, with values reaching 1700 K during 20:10:45\u2013\n20:11:45 UT. Within the same region, the mainly northward\nelectric field magnitude reaches 51 mV\/m, as shown in the\nthird panel. The discrete auroral arc is visible as an increased\nelectron density above 120 km during 20:11:45\u201320:12:45 UT\n(second panel), after which there is a short data gap. On the\nequatorward side of the arc there is some electron precipita-\ntion to the E- as well as the D-region. The D-region electron\ndensity has a maximum value at about 90 km, between 19:51\nand 20:11 UT. The bottom panel of Fig. 6 shows the values\nof total absorption from IRIS (blue line) and EISCAT (red\nline). The values of CNA measured with IRIS were small,\nwith a maximum value of about 0.3 dB.

Examples of altitude profiles of electron density (top left), electron temperature (top right), electron-neutral collision frequency\n(bottom left) and calculated incremental absorption for the 70 to 140 km altitude in Event 1. The total absorption is obtained by integrating\nthe incremental absorption over height.\nthe EISCAT beam the maximum was 0.25 dB. The enhanced\nabsorption is co-located with the enhanced electron density\nin the D-region from 19:51 to 20:14 UT. During this time\ninterval, the measured and calculated absorption are almost\nequal. However, the calculated background values are about\n0.1 dB larger than the measured ones.\nWithin the narrow region of the enhanced electric field and\nelectron temperature on the equatorward side of the arc, there\nis no increase in the measured CNA. Also, the calculated\nCNA is at the same level as inside the arc. Figure 7 shows the\naltitude profiles from this time interval. The Te enhancement\ncentered at the altitude of 110 km produces a small enhance-\nment to the incremental absorption profile. The enhance-\nment amounts to about 0.01 dB between altitudes of 100 and\n120 km, so its effect to the total absorption is small, and the\nmain contribution comes below the altitude of 90 km.\n4 Discussion\nWe have studied two stable drifting arcs, which were associ-\nated with a region of CNA on the equatorward side of them.\nThe CNA close to magnetic midnight hours is generally at-\ntributed to the enhancement in the D-region electron densi-\nties, which, together with the high electron-neutral collision\nfrequency in the D-region, is capable of absorbing a part of\nthe cosmic radio noise (Collis et al., 1996; Stauning, 1996).\nPrevious studies have also shown that drifting auroral arcs\nduring a substorm growth phase are often associated with an\nenhanced electric field and enhanced electron temperature in\nthe E-region on the equatorward side of them, indicative of\na plasma instability (Williams et al., 1990; Opgenoorth et\nal., 1990; Aikio et al., 1993). The frequency range generally\nin use by riometers corresponds to the few-meter-length E-\nregion irregularities produced by the Farley-Buneman (FB)\ninstability. These waves are known to be generated in the\nelectrojet layer during periods of strong electric fields (Far-\nley, 1963; Bunemann, 1963). Initially, the mechanism has\nbeen proposed to be operated in the equatorial electrojet\n(D\u2019Angelo, 1976) and then the conclusion has been extended\nto the auroral electrojet (D\u2019Angelo, 1978; D\u2019Angelo, 1981;\nMehta and D\u2019Angelo, 1980). However, Farley et al. (1981)\npointed out that the irregularities are highly field-aligned, and\nsince the magnetic field is nearly vertical in the auroral zone,\neven very strong irregularities will be unable to scatter back\ninto space cosmic noise coming from more or less overhead.\nAnalysis of riometer observations by Siren (1982) supported\nthe idea that scattering of cosmic radio waves is unable to\nquantitatively account for the observed absorption intensities\nat high latitudes.\n1682 J.

Altitude profiles of electron density (top left), electron temperature (top right), electron-neutral collision frequency (bottom left) and\nincremental absorption for the 70 to 140 km altitude at 19:46\u201319:47 UT for Event 2. The strong enhancement in the Te, and its effect on the\ncollision-frequency and absorption at about 110 km altitude are clearly visible.\nThe E-region absorption has also been attributed to the en-\nhanced electron temperature directly. Stauning (1984) ex-\nplained the absorption event with values below 1.0 dB in the\nsummer cusp by an enhanced classical collision frequency\nin the strongly heated E-region, in association with strong\nionospheric electric fields exceeding 50 mV\/m. This value of\nthe electric field magnitude corresponds quite well to the ex-\nperimentally determined \u201cthreshold\u201d condition which should\nbe met in order for strong electron heating to start operat-\ning (Williams et al., 1990; Haldoupis et al., 1993; Aikio et\nal., 2002). It was also pointed out by Stauning (1984) that\nan event of this type requires a relatively dense E-region and\nsubstantially elevated electron temperatures to cause visible\neffects in the measured absorption. Due to this, daytime pro-\nfiles were selected in his work from the polar cusp, and dur-\ning the selected events, the density at 105 km height stayed\nclose to 2\u00b71011 m\u22123. During similar conditions, Olesen et al.\n(1986) have shown that the frequency selective absorption\n(lacuna) at the E-region critical frequency might well be ex-\nplained by the enhanced deviative absorption caused by the\nincreased electron-neutral collision frequency in the heated\nE-region. High electron temperature, therefore, seems a pos-\nsible explanation for lacuna and associated cosmic noise ab-\nsorption events.\nThe analysis of EISCAT data for these two events showed\nthat within the regions of CNA, enhanced electron densities\nin the D-region existed. However, on the equatorward side of\nan arc an elevated electron temperature in the E-region and\nenhanced electric field was found in Event 2. The nondevia-\ntive absorption was calculated between 70 and 140 km, and\nit was compared to the measured absorption at the point of\nEISCAT observation. In Event 1, CNA varied with time, and\nthis temporal variation was similar, both in the IRIS data and\nthe calculated CNA. However, the calculated CNA was on\nthe average 0.1 dB smaller than the measured one in Event 1,\nand there were some differences in the behaviour. There are\nseveral possible reasons for these differences. First, CNA\nwas spatially structured, and this may have some effect, since\nthe beam width of EISCAT is only 0.6\u25e6 as compared to the\nIRIS beam of about 13\u25e6. Second, the EISCAT beam is not\nlocated exactly at any single IRIS beam position but the IRIS\nmeasurements have been interpolated to the location of EIS-\nCAT. Third, there are uncertainties in the calculated CNA.\nWe used the MSIS model to estimate the electron tempera-\nture for the lowest altitudes, and they were used in calculat-\ning the electron-neutral collision frequencies and the Debye-\ncorrection for the electron density. The number densities of\nneutral molecules are from the MSIS model and thus, the\n\u03c5en is probably the largest source of error in the calculation.\nJ. R. T. Jussila et al.: CNA event associated with growth phase auroral arcs 1685\nAlso, the measured parameters have certain confidence lim-\nits. Despite these uncertainties, the calculated and measured\nCNA are in good agreement in both of the events.\nThe maximum absorption was produced at an altitude of\nabout 80 km in both events. The maximum altitude of the\nD-region electron density enhancement took place at 84 km\n(Event 1) and at 90 km (Event 2). Both the altitude of\nthe density enhancement and the peak absorption remained\nrather constant throughout the events. The electrons caus-\ning density enhancement in D-region may originate from the\nradiation belts but the discussion of the precipitation mecha-\nnisms is beyond the scope of this paper and we refer to the\npaper by Sergeev et al. (1990).\nIn Event 2, a region of elevated Te, centered at 110 km,\nwas located on the equatorward side of the arc, with the value\nreaching 1700 K, about 1300 K above the background level.\nThe width of the region of enhanced Te was of the order of\nthe arc width, 15 km. The altitude range of the temperature\nenhancement was about 10 km (height resolution was 3 km),\nso it was very narrow. The incremental absorption profile\nshowed a clear enhancement between 100 and 120 km, com-\npletely accounting for the absorption of the order of 0.01 dB.\nHowever, the main part of the absorption comes from alti-\ntudes below 90 km. The small effect of the enhanced Te on\nthe absorption is partly due to the very low Ne within the\nsame region: the enhanced electric field and Te tend to occur\nin the auroral cavity (Aikio et al., 2002).\nIn Event 2, the enhancement of Te, with a value of 1300 K\nover the background in the narrow region just equatorward\nof the arc, was well correlated with the electric field value\nexceeding 50 mV\/m, in accordance with FB instability. We\ncan argue that during this time the electric field is responsi-\nble for the Te enhancement in relatively low density plasma.\nHowever, in this narrow region no measurable enhance-\nment in CNA due to plasma instability can be detected. In\nEvent 1, the magnitude of the electric field remains small\n(\u226420 mV\/m) within the region of CNA. Poleward of this\nregion the arc electric field intensifies to a level of about\n50 mV\/m and somewhat above. Also, the Te around 110 km\nis increased within this region, and the maximum (500 K\nabove background) is obtained at a point where the electric\nfield is about 50 mV\/m but the variance is very large. No\nsignificant increase in CNA is observed within this region.\nIf the wave scattering mechanism would have played a sig-\nnificant role in these events, the calculated absorption would\nhave been clearly smaller than the measured one. In that case\nit had been necessary to replace the classical collision fre-\nquency with an effective collision frequency caused by the\ncollective interaction of electrons with waves.\n5 Conclusions\nWe have presented simultaneous data from optical auroral,\ncosmic radio noise absorption and plasma parameter mea-\nsurements for two events, 7 December 1999 (Event 1) and\n8 April 1998 (Event 2). Our aim was to study whether the\nconventional D-region or the alternative E-region processes\nproduce the measured absorption bay during the substorm\ngrowth phase. The proposed mechanisms to cause absorp-\ntion are (1) the enhancement of D-region electron density\nby precipitated energetic electron or protons, (2) the wave\nscattering of cosmic radio noise due to instabilities in the E-\nregion and\/or (3) the effect of the highly enhanced electron\ntemperature in the E-region.\nBoth of the events studied occurred during the growth\nphase of an auroral substorm in the evening MLT sector,\nwhen a quiet auroral arc and a region of CNA in the vicinity\nof the arc drifted equatorward. It was shown that the region\nof the most intense absorption in the absorption bay was lo-\ncated on the equatorward side and outside of the optical au-\nroral arc. Both of the events studied were associated with\nenhanced Ne in the D-region, with a maximum between the\naltitudes of 80 to 90 km. Event 2 was also associated with an\nintense electric field and an enhanced electron temperature\ncentered at an altitude of 110 km, on the equatorward side\nof the arc. The analyzed data show clearly that the effect of\nboth the electric field exceeding 50 mV\/m, and the enhanced\nTe at 110 km altitude with values up to 1700 K, for the total\nabsorption, is small.\nThe measured value of the electric field exceeded the\nthreshold value of Farley-Bunemann instability. However,\nIRIS measured no increase in CNA within the latitudinally\nnarrow region of the high electric field and increased Te.\nThis is in accordance with the theoretical predictions that\nfield-aligned irregularities are unable to scatter back a sig-\nnificant amount of cosmic noise (Farley et al., 1981). Our\ncalculations also showed that even though the value of Te\nwas tripled, it didn\u2019t produce an observable effect on the total\nabsorption by using the equation of nondeviative absorption.\nDue to the location of the Te enhancement in the E-region,\nthe effect on the electron-neutral collision frequency remains\nsmall. In addition, the enhancement is located in an auroral\ndensity cavity, which further decreases its effect. The situa-\ntion may be different in the dayside, as indicated by observa-\ntions of Stauning (1984) and Olesen et al. (1986).\nAs a conclusion, we argue that the absorption observed in\nthe vicinity of auroral arcs during a substorm growth phase,\ni.e. the absorption bay can entirely be explained by precipita-\ntion of electrons with energies over 30 keV from the plasma\nsheet, increases the electron density in the D-region.\nAcknowledgements.
