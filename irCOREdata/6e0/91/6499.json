This focus on the\nneed to bring about a 'culture shift' and the importance of 'change agents' is reflected in\nthe Dearing Report (DfEE, 1997) and in Funding Council initiatives such as TLTP and\nTLTSN (Davies, 1995). It is common for many of us who work in this area to feel that\nalthough we see clearly the task ahead, we have little at our disposal by way of evidence\nabout how far we have come. Much of the evidence which does exist, and which has been\nincorporated into lectures and reports, is anecdotal, local and small scale, although there\nhave been some larger studies, notably the Information Technology Assisted Teaching and\nLearning project (ITATL, 1997), and a 1999 study of C&IT materials funded by the\nFunding Councils (HEFCE, 1999a), and in the United States the national survey of\ndesktop computing and IT in higher education (Green, 1989-99). These showed a rapidly\nincreasing use of learning technology in higher education, and some of the limitations and\nrestrictions which staff feel, such as technical support. However, there had been no in-\ndepth study of the subject and institution-specific influences on academic staff use of, and\nattitudes to, learning technology.\nIn August 1996 we successfully tendered for the evaluation of the first two years of the\nLearning Technology Dissemination Initiative (LTDI), which was a project funded by the\nScottish Higher Education Funding Council to promote the use of learning technology\nand computer-based learning materials in SHEFC-funded Higher Education Institutions.\nLTDI operated from Heriot-Watt University from 1994 and in the words of the SHEFC\nCircular 8\/92, 'The aim of the programme is to make teaching and learning more\nproductive and efficient by harnessing modern technology' (SHEFC 1992). We were\ncommissioned to assess its impact on staff and students in Scottish higher education, and\nto make recommendations for future funding of learning technology by SHEFC.\nOur strategy was to examine the activities and outcomes of LTDI, within the context of\nthe views and opinions of three main groups: senior managers of HEIs, a representative\nsample of academic staff and 'learning technology experts' from a wide range of Scottish\ninstitutions. We needed to investigate what they thought about LTDI specifically, but to\nmake sense of the data we also needed to know what they thought about learning\ntechnology in general and, especially for academic staff, their length of experience in\nhigher education, their awareness of other agencies, etc.\nThe data presented here relate to the general views on the use of C&IT in learning and\nteaching which we obtained. Their views on the value or effectiveness of LTDI, which were\ngenerally positive and in favour of some continuing SHEFC support for learning\ntechnology in Scotland, appear in our full report (which can be obtained at\nhttp:\/\/www.flp. ed ac uk\/LTRGILTDI.htmt).\nSurvey methods\nThe data were all collected over a five-month period (October 1996-February 1997). There\nwere three main data sources: paper questionnaire, face-to-face interviews and document-\nary sources.\n6\nALT-] \u2022 Volume 8 Number 2\nAn anonymous questionnaire survey of academic staff in all departments of all Scottish\nHEIs was conducted. The questionnaire, which sought information on general learning\ntechnology issues as well as those directly related to LTDI, was designed to be suitable for\nall academic staff, ranging from those with little or no interest or involvement in learning\ntechnology through to those who considered themselves to be 'expert'. Respondents simply\nworked through the questionnaire and exited at the point relevant to their level of\nexperience with respect to LTDI. A PDF version of the survey is available at\nhttp:llwww.flp. ed ac uklLTRGILTDI. html.\nIn order to conduct the survey, a database was compiled of all academic departments in\nSHEFC-funded institutions. Copies of the questionnaire were then mailed to each head of\ndepartment, asking them to distribute a number of questionnaires (equal to at least 20 per\ncent of academic staff in the department), half to staff who were noticeably interested or\ninvolved with learning technology and half to those with little or no apparent interest or\ninvolvement. In this way 'matched pairs' of academic staff across the sector were targeted,\nwith the potential to reach around 20 per cent of the approximately 8,000 full-time\nacademic staff (calculated from 1994-5 data in SHEFC, 1996)). At the end of January\n1997,982 questionnaires had been returned, indicating a 60 per cent response rate (982 out\nof 1,600) and thus a coverage of approximately 12 per cent of all academic staff. The\nsurvey responses (both open comments and tickboxes) were entered into a Filemaker Pro\ndatabase, and numerical data exported into MS Excel, and analysed using Statview. The\nopen comments from the questionnaire were listed according to thematic content and in\npriority order based upon the number of similar responses.\nSemi-structured face-to-face interviews were carried out with senior managers of all\ntwenty-one Scottish HEIs ('institutional visits'); members of staff\/ educational develop-\nment units (or equivalent) at nineteen Scottish HEIs; and staff in CAL\/LT support units\n(or equivalent) at seven Scottish HEIs. Interviewees were informed that their answers were\nconfidential and non-attributable. The issues discussed during the interviews included the\npotential of learning technology, the HEI's current infrastructure and recent\ndevelopments, planning processes for C&IT, interactions with LTDI plus value and quality\nof service, future of funding in this area by SHEFC and preferred funding mechanisms.\nDetailed notes following the flow of discussion were made at the time, logged later\naccording to the question areas in the interview pro-forma, and subsequently re-analysed\nin the light of emerging themes.\nThe SHEFC Teaching Quality Assessment Reports for 1992-6 were analysed for references\nto learning technology and to IT infrastructure, with comments being scored on a scale\nfrom highly complimentary to highly critical.\nResults\nRobustness of the survey\nGiven the particular importance of determining the validity of survey data, a question\nalways arises as to whether the population sampled is relevant and whether the returns are\nrepresentative. We believe, for the following reasons, that the survey responses are\nreasonably representative of the academic population, albeit with some possible bias\ntowards those with an interest and involvement in learning technology:\n7\nJeffHaywood et ol Learning technology in Scottish Higher Education - a survey\n\u2022 The numbers of returns from each HEI is a reasonable match with its overall size.\nThirty per cent of the responses were received from post-1992 institutions and 70 per\ncent from pre-1992 institutions, which contain 33 per cent and 67 per cent of the\nteaching staff respectively (SHEFC, 1996).\n\u2022 Fifty-eight per cent of respondents had not heard of LTDI, 43 per cent had heard of it\nand half of these (21 per cent of all respondents, i.e. 210 people) had had direct contact\nwith LTDI. Extrapolated to the whole academic population (c. 8,000) these 210\nrespondents would equate to about 1,800 staff, which accords reasonably well with\nLTDI's data on attendees and presenters at workshops in the first two years of its\noperation (c. 1,500).\n\u2022 The distribution of years of experience in higher education of respondents (34 per cent\nup to 10 years, 25 per cent from 10 to 20 years, 31 per cent from 20 to 30 years and 10\nper cent over 30 years) indicates that the survey took account of the views of the whole\nrange of higher education experience and did not unduly favour one group.\nRespondents reported the subject which they taught and these were arranged into four\ngroups - arts, social sciences, sciences and clinical\/paraclinical subjects (A, SS, S and\nCP respectively). There was a small but significant difference in the mean higher\neducation experience of the respondents - both SS and CP had means of\napproximately fouteeen years in higher education whereas A and S had means of\napproximately seventeen years. Many clinical staff begin teaching in higher education\nlater and move in and out more regularly than do other academic staff which would\nhelp to explain this difference. For staff in SS likely reasons are less clear although\nprofessional background (e.g. commerce) might be part of the explanation.\n\u2022 It was clearly possible that those staff who are interested or involved in the use of\nlearning technology would preferentially return forms over their less-involved\ncolleagues. We therefore asked respondents to rate themselves in relation to their peers\non experience in use of technology in their teaching (Figure 1). Whilst the distribution\nis skewed towards those who assessed themselves as having greater experience, there\nwere also comments from some heads of departments that they had found it difficult to\nidentify staff with little or no interest in learning technology, especially where there had\nbeen a departmental effort towards its greater use, and thus staff in these departments\nmight rate themselves as higher than average, not recognizing that the average had\nsignificantly changed.\nThe problem of errors in self-evaluation of skills and competencies is well-known in\neducational research (Moser and Kalton, 1985; Kline, 1993). Respondents may overrate or\nunderrate their skills depending upon the situation. In the absence of additional data, it is\nnot possible to be sure which, if any, bias such errors might create in this case. As we are\nnot concerned here with absolute ratings but with internal comparisons of one self-rated\ngroup with another within the same study, the effects of any bias are minimized.\nStaff attitudes towards learning technology\nThe first section of the questionnaire addressed the topics of the value of learning\ntechnology and the extent to which staff were aware of relevant agencies and initiatives. As\nnoted earlier, our respondents were proportionally distributed across the sector, came from\na wide range of experience in higher education and rated themselves generally a little above\n8\nALT-] Volume 8 Number 2\n40\n30\n10\nExperience of respondents with learning technology\nmuch less same greater\nself-relating relative to peers\nmuch greater\nFigure I: Distribution by self-rated experience with learning technology of academic staff who\nresponded to the questionnaire. In total 969 staff responded.\naverage in their experience of use of learning technology. We asked respondents to rate the\nimportance of C&IT in teaching in their own subject (Table 1). A substantial majority (67\nper cent) rated its potential as high (24 per cent) or very high (43 per cent), and only small\nnumbers (3.3 per cent) thought that its potential was low (3 per cent) or very low (0.3 per\ncent). Although as expected, most of those who professed higher or much higher than\naverage experience of learning technology rated its potential highly, it is interesting that\nmost of those who professed less or much less experience thought that its potential was\nmoderate or better. One possible bias here may be that, independent of personal\nexperience, returns came disproportionately from staff who feel that this is an important\nissue. However, as our sample is from around 12 per cent of the entire population, and only\na tiny percentage thought that there was little or no value in learning technology, this\nimplies a substantial acceptance across the higher education sector of the opportunities\nwhich it offers. This relatively positive picture is backed up for Scotland by data from the\nCTISS which shows proportionally twice as many contacts with CTI Centres by staff in\nScottish HEIs as compared with the rest of the UK (data supplied by CTISS).\nViews on the potential of learning technology in higher education were significantly and\nnegatively correlated with years.of experience in higher education. Those who thought that\nthe potential was very low or low had an average of nineteen years in higher education,\nthose who viewed the potential as moderate had seventeen years, and those who thought\nthat potential was high or very high had had least experience, sixteen and fourteen years\nrespectively. Some caution must be applied to analysis of these data, however, as there were\nonly three and twenty-nine respondents in the very low and low potential groups\nrespectively. In addition, none of these staff can be viewed as 'junior' since fourteen years\nin higher education is generally associated with middle-grade staff.\nIn the face-to-face interviews we were able to explore issues relating to the different views\nwhich exist of the potential of learning technology, particularly with respect to efficiency\ngains versus a role in quality enhancement and\/or maintenance. The latter view\n9\nJeffHaywood et al Learning technology in Scottish Higher Education - a survey\nExperience with\nlearning technology\nas compared to\ncolleagues\nMuch less (48)\nLess (119)\nSame (314)\nGreater (321)\nMuch greater (157)\nPotential for use of learning technology\nVery low\n%\n2.1\n0.8\n0.3\n0.0\n0.0\nLow\n%\n10.4\n8.4\n1.9\n2.2\n0.6\nModerate\n%\n41.7\n40.3\n34.4\n25.5\n16.6\nin respondent's\nHigh\n%\n39.6\n419\n44.6\n47.0\n30.6\nsubject\nVery high\n%\n6.3\n7.6\n18.8\n25.2\n52.2\nTable I: Respondents'ratings of the potential of learning technology in their subject area versus their\nself-rating of their experience with the use of learning technology in comparison to their colleagues.\nTotal numbers of respondents in each self-rating category are shown in parentheses in Column I. The\nbold entries highlight the small numbers of staff with little experience of learning technology who felt\nthat learning technology was of low or very lew potential in teaching of their subject\npredominated, albeit tempered by hopes that in some areas, especially assessment and\nstudent support, there could be savings in staff time. Few senior staff who were interviewed\nsaw opportunities for overall savings in the short or medium term, as the cost in staff time\nto select, implement and evaluate the use of learning technology is high and the costs in\nrolling upgrades of infrastructure are ever increasing. This view was also supported by\ncomments from learning technology support staff. No one voiced antipathy to the view\nthat there are opportunities for quality enhancement, although some clearly felt driven by\nexternal forces to adopt a pace which might not be that of their own choosing. Overall, the\ntask of convincing the majority of the Scottish higher education sector of the\nopportunities offered by learning technology appears to be well in hand. Converting this\npositive perception into action, however, is an entirely different matter.\nIt is important to note here that the view from respondents to the last section of our\nquestionnaire (those who gave written comments and thus had strong views) was that\nmany academic staff were hostile to learning technology or unwilling to use it. However,\nthis contrasts strongly with the general opinion expressed in the first section of the\nquestionnaire, namely that, irrespective of whether they had heard of LTDI or other\ninitiatives or of their experience, most staff thought that C&IT had moderate or greater\npotential in higher education. Whilst the failure of many to convert that view into action\nmay be interpreted by committed staff as antipathy or reluctance, it may actually have\nmore to do with how competing demands are prioritized or with practical difficulties\nencountered. Thus, relying on strongly expressed views from highly committed staff may in\nfact lead to an inappropriately negative impression of the state of the sector overall and its\nattitudes towards learning technology.\nAwareness o f initiatives' and learning technology agencies\nGiven the generally positive view of learning technology taken by the questionnaire\nrespondents, it is not surprising that their awareness of the agencies associated with its\npromotion is high (Table 2). Only 27 per cent of respondents (261\/969) had not heard of\nany of the agencies, whilst only 45 per cent (429\/969) reported not having had any direct\n10\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 2\nLearning technology\nexperience with\nrespect to\ncolleagues\nMuch less (49)\nLess (120)\nSame (317)\nMore (325)\nMuch more (158)\nTotal (969)\nCTI\n24.5\n43.3\n48.6\n69.2\n785\n58.5\nHeard\nLTDI\n20.4\n30.0\n325\n100.0\n100.0\n65.2\nof agency (%)\nTLTP\n20.4\n25.8\n34.1\n56.3\n73.4\n46.2\nITTI\n12.2\n15.8\n18.9\n25.8\n38.6\n23.7\none\n40.8\n60.8\n64.0\n82.5\n91.1\n73.1\nall\n6.1\n7.5\n12.6\n19.1\n32.3\n17.0\nContact with agency (%)\nCTI\n0.0\n5.8\n9.1\n26.8\n39.2\n19.1\nLTDI\n6.1\n11.7\n11.4\n25.8\n35.4\n19.9\nTLTP\n4.1\n5.8\n8.8\n22.2\n39.9\n17.8\nITTI\n0.0\n25\n0.9\n3.7\n7.6\n3.1\none\n8.2\n26.7\n35.3\n55.4\n69.6\n45.2\nTable 2: Awareness of, and contact with, learning technology agencies by academic staff grouped by\nself-rating of their own experience with the use of learning technology relative to that of their\ncolleagues.The numbers of respondents in each experience group is shown in parentheses.

As might be expected, both these types of respondents were clustered mostly\namongst those who rated themselves as less or much less experienced than their peers with\nlearning technology. Of those respondents who had heard of these agencies, slightly more\nhad heard of LTDI than of CTI (65 per cent vs. 58 per cent) and almost the same\npercentage had had contact with each (19 per cent and 20 per cent respectively), showing\nthat LTDI and CTI had made direct contact with almost a third of the staff who had heard\nof them. TLTP was slightly less well-known, followed by ITTI. The low knowledge of ITTI\nis not surprising given that the post-1992 HEIs were too late to get the full benefit from it\nand its range of actions and targets was much more restricted than other agencies. What is\nimpressive is that 73 per cent of all respondents in Scottish HEIs had heard of one of these\nagencies and 45 per cent had had some contact, mainly through workshops and seminars.\nInfluence on awareness of experience with learning technology\nNot unexpectedly, more learning technology-experienced staff had greater awareness of,\nand contact with, relevant agencies than had their less experienced colleagues. Awareness\nreached 100 per cent for LTDI and 91 per cent of the most experienced group had heard of\nat least one of the four agencies. It is striking that 41 per cent of the least experienced staff\nhad also heard of one of the four agencies and 55 per cent (93\/169) of the combined 'much\nless' and 'less' experienced groups had heard of one agency. Even allowing for the fact that\nthere is some skew in the distribution of self-rating in favour of the more experienced\ngroups, and that survey forms may have been selectively returned by those with above\naverage interest in learning technology, these percentages imply a substantial impact by\nthese agencies on the consciousness of academic staff in Scotland. The key role of subject\nfocus in use of C&IT in learning and teaching is demonstrated by the relatively high\nawareness of the CTI Centres amongst the less experienced groups.\nII\nJeffHaywood et al Learning technology in Scottish Higher Education - a survey\nInfluence on awareness of length of time in higher education\nAwareness of, or contact with, agencies was not influenced by the number of years in higher\neducation, contradicting stereotypes of 'older' staff being less interested in new teaching\nmethods or 'younger' staff being too busy with research. However, more recently appointed\nstaff did appear to be more involved in learning technology. Staff who rated themselves\n'much less' or 'less experienced' with C&IT than their colleagues had an average of almost\nnineteen years in higher education, whereas those who self-rated as of the 'same', 'greater' or\n'much greater' experience than their peers all had an average of approximately fifteen years in\nhigher education. These data compare favourably with those relating staffs' attitudes to\nlearning technology and the length of time they had spent in higher education.\nInfluence on awareness of subject area\nContrary to the prevailing stereotype, there was no significant difference between any of\nthe broad subject areas of arts (A), clinical\/paraclinical (CP), sciences (S) and social\nsciences (SS) with respect to respondents' views of the potential of learning technology in\ntheir area. There was also no difference in the self-ratings of learning technology\nexperience between staff in A, SS and S but, in contrast, respondents in clinical\/\nparaclinical subjects gave consistently lower self-ratings than the other areas. Their lower\nself-rating correlates with significantly lower awareness of agencies set up to promote and\nsupport use of C&IT in education. Twice as many clinical\/paraclinical respondents. (43 per\ncent) had not heard of any of the four agencies (LTDI, CTI, ITTI, TLTP) in comparisons\nwith S and SS (22 per cent and 25 per cent respectively), with arts slightly higher at 29 per\ncent. Similar results were found when contact with agencies was analysed. This probably\npartly explains our observation that significantly more staff in large institutions had heard\nof none of the agencies, as three of the large Scottish HEIs have medical schools, and the\nlower number of years of experience of staff in higher education in these subjects.\nInfluence on awareness of staff in different types of higher education institution\nStaff in smaller institutions (<200 academic staff) were more aware of the learning\ntechnology agencies, and more of them had heard of all four agencies, than their\ncolleagues in medium (200-500 staff) and larger institutions (>500 staff), perhaps reflecting\nthe ease with which information can be disseminated around them (data not shown). It is\nalso the case that in this population in Scotland there are several monotechnic institutions\n(teacher training colleges, art colleges) where the range of subjects taught is quite small. At\nthe opposite end of the awareness spectrum, significantly more staff in large institutions\nhad not heard of any of the agencies, and the presence in three of these of large clinical\nand paraclinical subjects is likely to be part of the explanation. There was no significant\ndifference between staff as a whole in pre- and post-1992 institutions in awareness of, or\ncontact with, any of the four agencies.\nBarriers to use of learning technology in teaching and learning\nIn spite of the broadly positive views of the value of learning technology, it should be\nnoted that we observed, and respondents registered, a strong feeling that many serious\nbarriers still exist which inhibit its widespread use by staff in their teaching. A similar set of\nthemes reverberated throughout the open comments made in the questionnaire, whether\nthey referred to reasons for not considering it feasible to make use of C&IT in learning and\nteaching, the obstacles encountered in trying to develop such activities, or the challenges\nidentified as faced by agencies. Staff with greater experience of learning technology were\n12\nALT-] Volume 8 Number 2\nQ8\nReasons for not\nconsidering use of\nlearning technology in\nteaching\ninsufficient resources,\ntime, & priority (50%)\nlack of IT skills (25%)\ncourse characteristics\nnot favourable (25%)\nQIO+I I\nFactors inhibiting\nlearning technology\ndevelopment\nlack of suitable software\n(40%)\nlack of staff time (34%)\ninsufficient local\ninstitutional support\n(23%)\ngeneral lack of resources\n(11%)\nlack of appropriate\nhardware (9%)\nQI5a\nChallenges faced by\nLTDI\nresistance to use of\ntechnology generally\namongst teaching staff\n(33%)\nlack of staff time (15%)\nrelative status of\nteaching priorities &\nincentives (13%)\ndeveloping a\nrecognized functional\nniche (11%)\nlack of institutional\nresources (9%)\nlack of staff IT skills\n(9%)\nlack of appropriate\nhardware (7%)\nlack of appropriate\nsoftware (4%)\nQI5d\nWays forward\ninstitutional\/subject\narea\/departmental\nsupport (39%)\nsupport for software\ndevelopment (25%)\nsupport for other\ninitiatives (11%)\nreduce staff\nworkloads (11%)\nstaff IT training (7%)\nhardware (7%)\nTable 3: Themes present in open-ended responses to selected questions in the academic staff\nquestionnaire. Values in parentheses are the percentages of comments which contained each theme.\nmore inclined to supply these comments than were less experienced staff; 12.5 per cent of\nall respondees gave comments; 8 per cent of the much less experienced group did so as\ncompared with 17 per cent of the much more experienced group. As the less experienced\ngroups were smaller than the more experienced group, the majority of the open comments\ncame from 'experts' rather than from 'novices'.\nThe themes which emerged in the open comments questions of the paper survey are\nsummarized in Table 3.\nThese difficulties include:\n\u2022 lack of time, once high priority tasks have been accounted for, which is the principal\nlimitation for many staff, particularly those in the former SOED HEIs;\n13\nJeffHoywood et o\\ Learning technology in Scottish Higher Education \u2014 a survey\n\u2022 perceptions of the relatively low status, and hence rewards, accorded to teaching\ncompared with research, especially given the pressures of the Research Assessment\nExercise with its significant implications for funding;\n\u2022 lack of reliable and adequate infrastructure, including technical support to deliver\ncourseware at reasonable cost in terms of academic effort;\n\u2022 lack of appropriate courseware in some subjects;\n\u2022 lack of basic C&IT skills, especially in HEIs where the IT infrastructure is quite new.\nThe difficulties enumerated by staff are, of course, not all unique to the use of learning\ntechnology. Some apply to all teaching innovations, but perhaps they become more\nobvious where C&IT is concerned due to the acute way in which it forces these barriers\ninto the open.\nHowever, whilst improvements in IT infrastructure are relatively easily made, releasing\ntime for staff to be creative in their teaching, and rewarding and valuing this alongside\nother activities will be less easy to achieve. Comments in the questionnaire stressed the\nimportance of incentives - 'convincing universities that teaching skills are important' and\n'convincing lecturers that it is in their career interests to invest time and effort' in 'what are\n[the] time-intensive activities' entailed in course development. Where the topic arose within\ninstitutional visits, many HEIs admitted that progress in this regard was still slow, or\nperceived to be so by many staff. This important issue clearly affects innovation in teaching\ngenerally, and is not restricted to the use of learning technology.\nFinally, culture change is slow. The cyclic nature of academic years results in changes to\ncourses often lagging one or two years behind the decision to change, partly because of the\nneed to plan ahead but also because changes in course structures, particularly where they\nimpinge on assessment procedures, need to be reviewed and approved by relevant\ncommittees within the institutions. Thus many effects of learning technology agencies may\nnot be seen for another one or two years. This slow change is not necessarily a negative\nphenomenon. For change to be embedded, there has to be movement on a broad front,\ntaking a substantial number of staff along with it rather than a small number of\nenthusiasts, and for this to happen enough time and focused support will be needed.\nHowever, although these changes may be slow, this survey does indicate that the process is\nfirmly underway.\nSHEFC Quality Assessment Reports\nThe importance of the Teaching Quality Assessment process in shaping course design and\ndelivery cannot be ignored. Despite the present uncertainty about the overall format of\nTQA in the next few years, ensuring that it reflects the need to identify and comment on\nuse of learning technology would assist those staff who are working to introduce it into\ntheir courses.\nBy the end of the academic year 1995-6, SHEFC had published 224 Quality Assessment\nReports covering 32 cognate areas (SHEFC 1992-6). The Quality Assessment Framework\nmentions IT infrastructure in teaching and learning in Section E, and innovative teaching\nmethods making use of all facilities in Section G. As assessors use this framework to\nstructure their assessment and reports, these peer reviews are an important guide to the\n14\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 2\ncurrent level of use of C&IT and also to the importance attached to this by the assessors\n(in itself an interesting insight into the minds of respected members of the profession).\nA brief analysis of references in the reports to provision and use of C&IT was made by\nrating comments on a 'critical' to 'complimentary' scale from through 0 to +++. This\nexposed some interesting trends. The first was the relatively high importance placed on\nprovision of computers and software in some subjects (e.g. theology, mathematics and\nstatistics) and the relatively low importance placed on it in others (e.g. civil engineering,\nsocial work). Indeed some assessment teams rarely mentioned the topic at all, and there\nwas often inconsistency in reporting within single cognate areas, perhaps reflecting\nvariations in composition of assessment teams. What was generally the case was the\npaucity of direct reference to the use of technology in teaching and learning as opposed to\nthe provision of a hardware\/software infrastructure. By looking for indirect evidence of the\nabsence of use of C&IT by such comments as 'emphasis on traditional teaching methods',\n'little use of innovative teaching methods' etc., it is possible to gauge the lack of use of\nlearning technology. The outcome of this brief analysis showed that many departments\nacross Scotland had yet to make significant innovations in their teaching (indeed to move\nto a more student-centred view with the emphasis on learning) despite some being rated\noverall in the reports as 'excellent'.\nThere are caveats to this analysis. Firstly, the 'Confidential Notes for the Institution' are\nnot publicly available and secondly the lead time for introduction of substantive change to\ncourses is long, and some reports did comment on changes under way. Nevertheless, taken\nas a whole the reports do suggest the need for continued support to this area.\nConclusions\nThese surveys and interviews provide the first in-depth information on the awareness of,\nand views about, learning technology of a wide range of staff in Scottish higher education.\nIt is clear that the efforts of those involved in awareness-raising have paid off, in that few of\nour respondents were unaware of any LT agency and many knew of several. This was true\neven for staff who rated themselves as lower in experience with learning technology than\ntheir colleagues. Substantial numbers had also made contact in some way with at least one\nagency. Very few staff at any level viewed C&IT as of little or no value to teaching in their\nsubject, most seeing it as being of moderate to significant value, but more for quality\nenhancement than for efficiency gains. There was no significant difference in these views\nbetween broad subject areas and age or type of HEI. These positive attitudes are also\nreflected in the Dearing Report (DfEE, 1997,3rd Report) where a survey of academic staff\nshowed that most of the effected changes in teaching were based upon new technologies\nand were designed to benefit students rather than for institutional or efficiency gains.\nThe data are also broadly in line with later findings in the UK. In the recent survey of use\nof TLTP materials in UK higher education (HEFCE, 1999b) 31 per cent of academic staff\nrespondents reported that they thought their subject 'lends itself greatly' to use of C&IT in\nlearning and teaching, and 60 per cent felt that it 'lends itself moderately'. Of these staff,\n95 per cent thought that there was scope for expansion in the use of C&IT in the teaching\nof their subject at moderate or substantial levels.\nIn contrast with this, the most experienced staff and especially those in learning technology\n15\nJeffHaywood et at Learning technology in Scottish Higher Education - a survey\nsupport roles, had a more pessimistic view and felt that many of their colleagues were\nhostile or unwilling to take the challenge of adopting it in their teaching. This contrast of\nperspectives is important given the use of key informants in much of what informs policy-\nmaking in higher education.\nHowever, significant barriers to the use of learning technology do still exist, especially the\nlack of time for academic staff and the relative importance placed on research as compared\nto teaching. These themes are also evident in other studies of this subject. For instance, in\nthe United States, the Campus Computing 1999 survey of 530 senior computing services\nstaff in colleges nation-wide notes that 'assisting faculty to integrate information\ntechnology into instruction' is now the major challenge (Green, 1999). Although the\nmajority of institutions had established a centre to support the use of learning technology,\nvery few had formal recognition of such C&IT-based teaching in their academic staff\nreview and promotion procedures. In the UK, a comparable lack of embedded\ninstitutional commitment to new technologies is evident in the findings of the recent study\nof C&IT materials in higher education and further education (HEFCE, 1999a) in which\nthe learning and teaching strategies of all English HEIs were analysed. Only a small\nnumber of HEIs had identified enhanced use of C&IT as a major part of their strategy,\ndespite the fact that a wide variety of developments are taking place within all of them.\nSimilar barriers to widespread uptake of learning technology were identified - lack of\ncommitment at senior management levels, research dominance over teaching, and technical\nand pedagogical support issues. It was as a consequence of concerns expressed in the\nDearing Report about the need to give more support to innovation in learning and\nteaching (DfEE, 1997), that the Institute for Learning and Teaching (ILT) was established\nto provide a counterweight to the dominance of research in higher education, promote a\nculture shift and 'a re-think of institutional priorities'.\nFinally, there is little evidence that the TQA exercise in Scotland in the period 1992-6 took\nany systematic stance towards the use of learning technology in the subjects which were\nassessed, despite its stated involvement in the rationale for the establishment of the QA\nsystem. This may give us an important insight into the views of senior members of the\nprofessions who formed the peer assessment panels, and perhaps raises concern with\nrespect to their awareness of, and concern for, innovation in the teaching of their subject.\nAlthough the data in this study come from responses from staff who were to a large extent\nself-selecting in their decision to return surveys about C&IT in learning and teaching, large\nnumbers of academic staff did return them. Even allowing for some bias, the absolute\nnumber of staff in the Scottish higher education sector with a positive view of the value of\nC&IT is encouraging and may be taken as an indicator that it has moved from a fringe to a\nmainstream concern for academic staff in all subject areas. Supporting those staff and\nbuilding upon that base is an urgent task for both the institutions and the Funding\nCouncils.\nAcknowledgements\nWe should like to acknowledge the input of all those who helped us in the course of our\nwork, in particular the staff of the Scottish HEIs and agencies who gave generously of\ntheir time to participate in interviews, and for the open way in which they expressed their\n16\nALT-) Volume 8 Number 2\nopinions.
