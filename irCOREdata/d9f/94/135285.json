Nitrotyrosine concentrations increased during early reperfusion in open AAA repair, but not during endovascular repair. AAA exclusion from the circulation reduced levels to control values (P = 0\u00b7001). Patients with an AAA had raised levels of circulating nitrated proteins compared with patients with claudication and controls, suggesting a greater degree of ongoing inflammation that was not related to smoking.
