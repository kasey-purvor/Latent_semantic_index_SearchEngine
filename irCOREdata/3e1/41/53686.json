Studies investigating the nature of \nselective attention in 3D space have reported reliable effects of location cues to \u2018near\u2019 \nand \u2018far\u2019 locations on performance measures in real depth situations (Gawryszewski, \nRiggio, Rizzolatti & Umilt\u00e1, 1987; Downing & Pinker, 1985; Couyoumdjian, Di \nNocera & Ferlazzo, 2003), in stereoscopic displays (e.g. Atchley, Kramer, Anderson \n& Theeuwes, 1997; Atchley & Kramer, 1998; Theeuwes, Atchley & Kramer, 1998; \nBourke, Partridge & Pollux, 2006) in perceived space (Han, Wan & Humphries, \n2005) and within pictorial scenes (Parks & Corballis, 2006). Particularly in \u2018real \ndepth\u2019 experimental situations, deployment of attention is characterized by an \nasymmetric effect of spatial cueing, first referred to as the \u2018near-effect\u2019 by \nGawryszewski et al. in 1987. In this study spatial attention was cued at fixation with \nhigh probability to one of two target LEDs, one located near the viewer and the \nsecond at a depth beyond fixation but still within reaching space. Their results showed \nthat detection times were greater when the target was presented at the un-cued \nlocation, but this effect of cueing varied with direction. Detection times for targets at \nthe far location when attention had been cued to the near LED were greater than when \nattention was cued to the far location and the target was presented at the near LED \n(Gawryszewski et al., 1987). Comparable asymmetric effects have been observed \nwithin pictorial scenes (Parks & Corballis, 2006) and in stereoscopic depth where \nreorienting from near to far locations is associated with greater error costs (Atchley, et \nal., 1997, but see Atchley & Kramer, 1998, for an exception). A few studies have \nfurther shown that the distribution of attention in depth is characterized by a gradient \n 3\nP107RA \nwhich is maximal at attentional focus and declines at more peripheral locations \n(Andersen, 1990; Downing & Pinker, 1985). Andersen (1990) presented random-dot \nstereograms of horizontal or vertical bars at the centre with distractor bars presented \nat the either the same or different depths as the centre bars, and found that \nperformance declined as a function of distance from attentional focus. In real space, \nDowning & Pinker (1985) also showed that the cost of reorienting to stimuli at un-\ncued locations (varying in horizontal distance and in depth) was greater when the un-\ncued target was at a different depth. Their analysis of reorienting \u2018cost\u2019 in relation to \ndistance from attentional focus further showed that attention seems to decline as a \nfunction of a gradient defined in terms of visual-angle separation, and that this decline \nis stronger for stimuli presented at a different depth than the attentional focus.   \nWhile the number of studies reporting the near-bias is increasing in the \nliterature, little is known about the processes underlying the effect. In Gawryszewski \net al.\u2019s (1987) original explanation, the near-effect was associated with a viewer-\ncentred spatial representation accessed for guiding attention in 3D space. They \nproposed that an attentional space is dynamically created between the attended object \nand the viewer in response to the spatial depth cue. More specifically, when attention \nis cued to the near location, Gawryszewski et al. (1987) argue that attention spreads \nfrom the maximal focus of attention to the observer. As a result, spatial awareness is \nenhanced at the near relative to the far location when the target is presented in this \ncondition. When attention is cued to the far location, the attentional space extends \nfrom the far location to the body, resulting in equal spatial awareness of the near and \nfar LED when the target is presented. Consequently, reorienting attention from the \ncued near location to far target LED is relatively slower (associated with longer target \n 4\nP107RA \ndetection times) than reorienting from the cued far location to the target near the \nviewer.  \nThe idea that the near-effect may reflect a general attentional bias towards \nnear stimuli is not supported by existing findings, as detection times to near and far \ntargets are generally comparable when the cue predicts the target location correctly in \nreal depth situations (Gawryszewski et al., 1987; Couyoumdjian et al., 2003). \nCouyoumdjian et al. (2003) further showed that the near-effect seems to be \nindependent of the boundary between peripersonal and extrapersonal space. Although \nthe authors found that cueing effects on target detection times were greater in a \ncondition where cued and target locations were separated by the boundary between \nperipersonal and extrapersonal space (1 meter), as compared to the situation where \nboth cued and target locations were either within peripersonal or extrapersonal space, \nthis boundary effect did not interact with reorienting direction. A comparable near-\neffect was observed across all conditions, suggesting that the reorienting bias is \nindependent of the proposed functional specialisation of 3D space (Couyoumdjian et \nal., 2003; Previc, 1998).  \nAlthough explanations to date assume that near-effect is associated with \naccess to a viewer-centred representation for guiding attention in 3D space (e.g. \nDowning & Pinker, 1985; Gawryszewski et al., 1987; Atchley et al., 1997; Parks & \nCorballis, 2006), converging evidence suggests that the distribution of spatial \nattention in peripersonal space can be influenced by the position of the viewer\u2019s hand \nwhen performing tasks involving manual responses (e.g. Mattingley, Robertson & \nDriver, 1998; Eimer, Forster, van Velzen, & Prabhu, 2005, Eimer & van Velzen, \n2006). In a neuropsychological investigation of visual extinction, Mattingley et al. \n(1998) showed for example that extinction of stimuli within left space was reduced \n 5\nP107RA \nwhen stimulus presentation was initiated by a key-press with the patient\u2019s left hand. \nERP findings reported by Eimer et al. (2005) further showed that when one hand was \ncued for responding (lift of index finger), somatosensory ERP components elicited by \n(task irrelevant) tactile stimuli presented between cue-onset and a \u2018go\u2019 or \u2018no-go\u2019 \nsignal were enhanced. Both findings were considered consistent with the idea that \npreparation of manual responses is associated with shifts of attention to the response \nhand (Eimer et al., 2005, Eimer & van Velzen, 2006) or with enhanced spatial \nawareness within the visual field where the response hand is located (Mattingley et \nal., 1998).  \nA different line of evidence suggests that under certain task conditions \nattention is prioritized to the location of the viewer\u2019s hand, even when this hand is not \nused for responding (Reed, Grubb & Steel, 2006). Reed et al. (2006) used a horizontal \ncueing task (presented on a computer screen) with highly predictive cues for target \nlocation. Participants were instructed to place one hand in close proximity to one of \nthe two possible target locations whilst responding with the other hand (positioned \naway from the screen) at detection of the targets. Across five experiments, detection \ntimes to targets presented close to the passive hand were found to be faster than to \ntargets presented at the alternative location, independent from cue validity. This \nattentional prioritization effect persisted when the hand was hidden from view and \nwhen replaced by a fake rubber glove, but was absent when replaced by a visual \nanchor. It appears that proprioceptive information received from the hand is sufficient \nfor attentional prioritization of space around the hand, but visual information is not \nsufficient unless a connection is made between the visual input and the actual hand. \nReed et al further showed that the extent of the prioritized area around the passive \nhand was relatively small, as the effect disappeared when the hand was placed \n 6\nP107RA \ntowards the side of the computer screen, increasing horizontal distance between \nstimulus and hand to 11 cm. The consistency between this pattern of results and \ncharacteristics of bimodal neurons in peripersonal space (e.g., Graziano & Gross, \n1995) suggests the attentional prioritization effect is likely to reflect the influence of \nbimodal hand-centred representations on spatial attention (Reed et al., 2006). \nThe accumulating evidence for hand-centred attention in peripersonal space \nraises the question of whether allocation of spatial attention in the depth cueing task is \ninfluenced by the position of the response hand. As the hand was always positioned \nnear the viewer in previous studies investigating attention in real depth situations, the \nnear-effect could have been associated with a bias to the response hand instead of a \nbias to viewer-centred near space. The present study aims to investigate this question \nby varying the position of the responding hand whilst performing the depth cueing \ntask. In Experiment 1, participants placed their response hand at the same depth of \neither a \u2018near\u2019 or \u2018far\u2019 target LED. If the near-bias in reorienting of attention reflects a \nbias towards the response hand, then placing the hand at the same depth as the far \nLED may reverse the reorienting bias to the far target location. Alternatively, if the \nnear-effect reflects the influence of a 3D viewer-centred spatial representation on \nspatial attention, as suggested by Gawryszewski et al. (1987), the bias should be \nunaffected by response-hand position.  \n \n \nEXPERIMENT 1 \n \nMETHOD \n \n 7\nP107RA \nTwenty-eight right-handed volunteers participated in Experiment 1. Fourteen \nvolunteers were allocated to the \u2018Hand-Far\u2019 Condition (mean age = 24 , sd = 5.6) and \n14 participant to the \u2018Hand-Near\u2019 condition (mean age = 23, sd = 4.5). All \nparticipants were right handed, had normal or to normal corrected vision and reported \nno problems of colour vision or depth perception. \n Subjects were seated in a comfortable chair with their head placed in a chin \nrest, looking down a rail at three LEDs mounted on rods. Distances of the near, \nmiddle and far LED from the viewer position were 19, 31 and 43 cm, respectively. \nAll testing took place in a fully lit room under binocular viewing conditions and \nparticipants were instructed to maintain fixation on the centre LED. To maximise \ncontrol over luminance differences between the LEDs, a small cap was placed on \neach light with a hole drilled in the middle of the front face of the cap. The diameter \nof this hole was 2 mm for all three caps (visual angle was 0.6\u00b0 and 0.27\u00b0 for the near \nand far target stimulus, respectively). Luminance of the LEDs was measured with a \nlight photometer (Hagner Universal, Model S3) positioned on a tripod at a distance of \n30 cm from the LED. Luminance levels of the 2 red target LEDs (with the caps on) \nwere adjusted to approximately 21 CD\/m2, and to 58 CD\/m2 for the colours green and \nblue at the centre LED.  \nTo ensure that the LEDs were viewed at eye-level, an \u2018eye-level marker\u2019 was \nconstructed, consisting of a transparent plastic square fixed to two rods, both attached \nto a base. A horizontal line was marked across the plastic square. This marker was \nplaced between the chin rest and the LEDs. Chin rest and chair were adjusted until \nparticipants reported that the marker line crossed the midlines of all three LEDs. \nParticipants were subsequently asked to describe the visual experience associated \n 8\nP107RA \nwith fixating at the centre LED. All participants reported symmetric diplopic images \nof the near and the far LED.  \nFor the experimental tasks, subjects were required to respond to the onset of a \nred target light presented at the near or far location by pressing a key on a button box \naffixed to the rail behind the far rod in the Hand-Far condition and behind the near \nrod in the Hand-Near condition. The hand was placed around the button box and the \nrod: The thumb was placed to the front of the rod, the index finger (used for \nresponding) was placed on the response key, and the remaining three fingers were \nplaced around the back of the button box, resting against the box and on the rail. \nDistance between the response-key and the LED was 9 cm. Two cardboard boxes \nwere fixed to the table to ensure a comfortable position of the arms. Participants were \ninstructed to place their left (non-responding) arm on the left box (placed away from \nthe target scene) and to not move this arm beyond the depth of fixation. Both arms \nwere visible for the duration of the Experiment.  \n \n[Figure 1 approximately here] \n \nThe probable location of the target was cued by lights presented at the central \nLED (green or blue light). The cue-light was presented until the target appeared and \ntargets were presented for 70 ms. In both groups of fourteen people, seven \nparticipants were instructed to attend \u2018near\u2019 in response to the blue cue-light, and to \nattend \u2018far\u2019 in response to the green cue-light in the depth cueing task. Cue-location \nmapping was reversed for the remaining 7 participants within each group. Probability \nof valid vs. invalid cued trials was 80:20 and the task consisted of four blocks of 240 \ntrials. Each block consisted of 160 valid cued trials, 40 invalid cued trials and 40 \n 9\nP107RA \ncatch trials. These catch trials were included to prevent anticipatory responses. A \nneutral cueing condition was not included given the concerns raised about the use of \nthis condition as a baseline for measures of \u2018facilitation\u2019 and \u2018inhibition\u2019 in covert \nvisual spatial orienting tasks (Gawryszewski et al., 1987; Jonides & Mack, 1984). \nBased on previous findings showing that effect of endogenous horizontal cueing on \ndetection times tend to reach a maximum around 300 ms after cue-onset (e.g., M\u00fcller \n& Rabbitt, 1989), stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) was varied randomly between \n300 or 600 ms.   \nAs retinal regions covered by the near and far target light were not the same, \ndetection times were measured in a control task (Target-Control task), where red \nlights illuminated at random at the two target locations. Subjects were instructed to \nrespond as quickly as possible on detection of the red light whilst maintaining gaze at \nthe centre LED. A warning tone was presented 300 or 600 ms before presentation of \nthe red light. Delay between response (or the 1000ms cut-off in the case of catch \ntrials) and onset of the cue was 500 milliseconds. The same task parameters were \nused to measure detection of the cue lights in a second control task (Cue-control \ntask). Both tasks consisted of 112 trials in addition to 16 catch trials, where the \nwarning tone was not followed by a light.  \nParticipants were introduced to the depth cueing task in two practice blocks, \neach consisting of 40 trials. To allow familiarisation with the cue-colour\/location \nmapping, the first practice block consisted of valid cued trials only. The second block \nconsisted of 32 valid, 8 invalid and 8 catch trials. Experimental blocks of trials were \npaused automatically after every 40 trials for a time determined by the participant. \nErrors (RT \u2264 100 ms or \u2265 1000 ms, and responses on catch trials) were repeated after \neach block of 240 trials. Control tasks were presented at the end of the testing session.  \n 10\nP107RA \nTo be able to exclude trials in which eye-movements were made between \nonset of the cue-light and offset of the target light, HEOG and VEOG were recorded \nwith Ag\/AgCl electrodes placed on the outer canthi of the left and right eye, and \nbelow and above the left eye, referenced to two mastoid electrodes placed behind the \ntwo ears. The EOG was digitised at 256 Hz per channel and amplified with a \nbandpass of 0.1 \u2013 35 Hz. To establish whether eye-movements could be detected in \nthe EEG, a short test was developed consisting of 40 trials. Participants were \nrequested to move their eyes (in blocks of 5 trials) to the near and far LED. Each trial \nwas initiated by a warning tone. Testing on four participants revealed clearly \ndetectable waves in response to horizontal eye-movements and divergent\/ convergent \neye-movements on all 40 trials when the signals from the electrodes placed around \nthe eyes were compared to signals from mastoids (below the eyes for VEOG, outer \ncanthi for HEOG). All trials where the amplitude exceeded 70\u00b5V between cue-onset \nand target-onset were tagged during testing. Final rejection of eye-movement trials \noccurred off-line after testing by manual inspection of all tagged trials.  \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nDepth cueing task: Error trials were excluded from RT analysis of the depth \ncueing task. Means of median response times (RT) were entered in a Mixed Repeated \nMeasures ANOVA, with the factors SOA, Target Location (near vs. far) and Cue \n(valid vs. invalid cue). Response Hand Position (RHP: near vs. far) was entered as the \nbetween subjects factor. Only significant effects are reported here (Table 1 shows the \nresults for all effects in the depth cueing task). The analysis revealed a significant \nmain effect of Target Location [F(1,26) = 71.58; p < 0.001], with longer RT to targets \n 11\nP107RA \npresented at the far target location. The main effect of Cue was also significant \n[F(1,26) = 54.57; p < 0.001], reflected in longer RT to invalid cued as compared to \nvalid cued targets. The effect of cueing was greater at the far as compared to the near \ntarget location, indicated by the significant interaction effect between Cue and Target \nLocation [F(1,26) =10.73; p = 0.003]. Post-hoc analysis (Bonferrroni adjustment) \nshowed that the effect of Cue was significant at both target locations (p < 0.001 for \nboth comparisons) and that the effect of Target Location was significant in both Cue \nconditions (p < 0.001 for both comparisons). To allow a comparison between cueing \neffects at the near and far target location, difference RT values due to cueing (RT \ninvalid \u2013 RT valid) were calculated. Comparison of these difference values confirmed \nthat that the effect of cueing was significantly greater at the far as compared to the \nnear target location [t(27) = 3.02; p = 0.005]. More importantly however, was the \nsignificant interaction effect between Cue, Target Location and Response Hand \nPosition [F(1,26) = 5.72; p = 0.024]. Figure 2 shows that the cueing effect in the RH-\nnear condition is asymmetric, whereas this asymmetry is absent in the RH-far \ncondition. Post-hoc analysis showed that this result was due to the effect of RHP on \ndetection times to invalid cued targets at the far target location. RT in this condition \nwas significantly longer in the RH-near condition than in the RH-far condition (p = \n0.013), whereas RT to invalid cued targets at the near location were not significantly \ndifferent in both response hand conditions (p = 0.26). The difference between the RH-\nnear and RH-far condition was also not significant for valid trials (Valid-near: p = \n0.44; Valid-far: p = 0.36). The effect of SOA was significant, with longer RT at \nSOA300 [F(1,26) = 6.06; p = 0.021], but this effect was different for the valid and \ninvalid cue conditions [SOA x Cue: F(1,26) = 38.16; p < 0.001]. Post-hoc analysis \nshowed that the effect of SOA was observable on valid trials but not on invalid trials. \n 12\nP107RA \nIn the valid cue condition, RT at SOA300 were significantly longer than at SOA600 \n(p = 0.006), whereas this difference was not significant on invalid trials (p = 0.53), \nresulting in enhanced cueing effects at SOA600.  \n \n    [Figure 2 here] \n \nControl tasks: For analysis of the Target Control task, means of median RT \nwere analysed with the factors Target Location and Response Hand Position. The \nmain effect of RHP was not significant [F(1,26) = 1.02; p = 0.32 ], but RT to lights \npresented at the far location were significantly longer than RT to near targets [F(1,26) \n= 24.2, p < 0.001]. This effect of Target Location was similar for both RHP \nconditions [F < 1]. Mean of median RT (SE in brackets) to near and far targets was \n261 (7) and 276 (8) ms (respectively) in the RH-near group, and 275 (7) and 289 (7) \nms (respectively) for the RH-far group. Analysis of the Cue Control Task with the \nfactors Cue-light (blue or green) and RHP yielded non-significant results for all three \neffects [Cue-colour: F < 1, RHP: F < 1; Cue-colour x RHP: F < 1]. Mean RT to green \nand blue cue-lights presented at the centre LED were 234 (5) and 236 (6) ms in the \nRH-near group, and 251 (6) and 251 (5) ms in the RH-far group. \n \nTo summarize, the analysis of Experiment 1 revealed significant effects of \nendogenous cueing at 300 ms after presentation of the cue, which were characterized \nby the near-effect when the response hand was positioned near the viewer. \nSpecifically and consistent with previous findings, the effect of invalid cueing on \ndetection times was greater for targets at the far compared to near target location \nwhen the hand was positioned at the near target depth. Placing the responding hand at \n 13\nP107RA \nthe far depth failed to reverse the near-bias to the far target location, suggesting that \nthe reorienting bias observed here and in previous studies was not simply due to the \nposition of the response hand. The finding that the far hand eliminated the asymmetry \nin cueing effects suggests however that spatial attention is influenced by hand-\nposition in the depth cueing task. This effect seems to be restricted to invalid cued \ntargets presented at the far target location. Neither the valid conditions nor the invalid \ncondition at the near target location were affected by position of the response hand.  \nOverall, the results of Experiment 1 seem to suggest that reorienting of \nattention to a target beyond fixation is associated with a reduction in detection time \n\u2018cost\u2019 when the hand is positioned at the far target depth. It remains to be established \nwhether elimination of the near bias is due to the mere presence of the hand at the far \nlocation or due to the fact that an active manual response had to be made. The \npossible contribution of a passive hand in the near-effect is explored in Experiments 2 \nand 3. Experiment 2 investigates whether addition of a passive hand in the visual \nscene will influence the effect of the response hand observed in Experiment 1. \nParticipants were instructed to place one hand on a response key at the near location \nand the other hand on the key at the far location for the duration of the experiment. \nManual responses were either made with the left or right hand in an alternating \nfashion across blocks, allowing comparison of \u2018passive-hand\u2019 and \u2018response-hand\u2019 \neffects on spatial attention whilst maintaining the visual scene and proprioceptive \ninformation equivalent across conditions. One possible outcome is that the presence \nor absence of the near-effect is dependent on the position of the response hand \n(consistent with Experiment 1), which would suggest that the hand-effect observed in \nExperiment 1 is predominantly associated with the response requirement, and not with \na passive hand. Alternatively, if both the passive- and the response-hand influence \n 14\nP107RA \nshifts of attention, possibly in an additive fashion, then the near-effect should be (at \nleast partly) reinstated when the passive hand is placed at the near location, and \nshould be reduced when the passive hand is placed at the far target location.  \n \nEXPERIMENT 2 \n \nMETHOD \n \nSixteen volunteers participated in Experiment 2 (mean age = 21, SD = 3.87). \nAll participants were right handed, had normal or to normal corrected vision and did \nnot report any problems with colour vision or depth perception.  \nThe following changes were made to the set-up and to the design for \nExperiment 2: A second button-box (identical to the button-box used in Experiment \n1) was affixed to the rail. One button-box was placed at the far depth, and the other \nbutton-box was placed close to the near rod. Positioning of the button-box relative to \nthe rod at each depth was identical to the positioning used in Experiment 1. Eight \nparticipants placed the right hand on the button box at the far depth and the left hand \non the button box at the near depth. This was reversed for the remaining eight \nparticipants. Positioning of the hands on the button-boxes was the same as the \npositioning in Experiment 1.  \nTesting took place in two sessions, each consisting of four block with 240 \ntrials. In each block, participants responded either with the right or the left hand. Four \nout of eight participants whose left hands were placed at the near depth responded \nwith the left hand in blocks 1 and 3 of session 1, and with the right hand in blocks 1 \nand 3 in session 2. This was reversed for the remaining four participants. The same \n 15\nP107RA \ncounterbalancing procedure was applied to participants whose right hands were \nplaced in proximity to near rod.  \nParticipants were instructed to keep the index finger of both the response hand \nand the passive hand on the response keys for the duration of each block to ensure \nsimilarity of proprioceptive information received from both hands before target \npresentation. Based on the finding that cueing effects were not maximal at SOA 300 \nms in Experiment 1, stimulus-onset asynchrony was increased for Experiment 2. To \nmaximise unpredictability of target onset, SOA was varied at random in steps of 50 \nms between 550 and 900 ms. The warning tone in the Control tasks was removed and \nthe response-stimulus interval in the Target Control task was adjusted to the SOA \nused in the depth cueing task. The Target Control task was presented in both sessions: \nEight participants responded with the hand positioned at the far location in session 1 \nand with the near hand in session 2. The reverse order was applied for the remaining \neight participants. \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nDepth cueing task: Means of median RT were entered in a Mixed Repeated \nMeasures ANOVA with the factors Response Hand Position (RHP near vs. far), \nTarget Location (near vs. far) and Cue (valid vs. invalid cue). The factor \u2018Hand\u2019 \n(either left or right hand placed at the far LED) was entered as the between subject \nfactor. The results revealed a significant effect of Target Location [F(1,14) = 32.2; p < \n0.001], reflected in longer RT to far compared to near targets, and a significant effect \nof Cue [F(1,14) = 26.7; p < 0.001], with longer response times to invalid cued targets. \nConsistent with the results of Experiment 1, cueing effects were greater at the far as \n 16\nP107RA \ncompared to the near target location [F(1,14) = 8.5; p = 0.011]. Post-hoc analysis \nshowed that the effect of Target Location was significant in both Cue conditions (p < \n0.001 for both comparisons), and that the effect of Cue was significant at both target \nlocations (p < 0.001 for both comparisons). To confirm that asymmetry in cueing \neffect was significant, RT difference values were calculated (RT invalid \u2013 RT valid). \nComparison of these difference values showed that cueing effects were greater at the \nfar as compared to near target location [t(15) = 3.009; p = 0.009]. The interaction \nbetween Target Location and RHP was significant [F(1,15) = 9.2; p = 0.009], but this \ninteraction effects is explained by the more important significant 3-way interaction \neffect between Cue, Target Location and RHP [F(1,15) = 8.06; p = 0.012]. Figure 3 \nshows a pattern of results consistent with the results of Experiment 1: The near-effect \nis present in the RH-near condition but is abolished by the response hand when this \nhand is positioned at the far target location. Post-hoc analysis revealed that RT to \ninvalid cued targets presented at the far target location were significantly faster in the \nRH-far compared to the RH-near condition (p = 0.006), whereas this difference was \nnot significant for invalid cued targets presented at the near target location (p = 0.12). \nThe difference between RH-far and RH-near conditions was also not significant for \nvalid cued trials (p > 0.09).  \n \n   [Figure 3 here] \n \nControl tasks: The Target Control task was analyzed using ANOVA with the \nfactors Response Hand Position (RHP), Target Location and the between subjects \nfactor Hand (either left or right hand at far depth). This analysis revealed a significant \neffect of Target Location [F(1,14) = 51.1; p < 0.001], but all other effects were not \n 17\nP107RA \nsignificant [F < 1]. Means of median RT to near and far targets (SE in brackets) were \n229 (6) and 242 (6) ms (respectively) in the RH-near condition, and 232 (8) and 245 \n(8) ms (respectively) for the RH-far condition. Analysis of the Cue Control task using \nANOVA with the factors Cue-colour (green vs. blue) and the between subjects factor \nHand revealed non-significant results for all effects [F < 1]. Mean RT to green and \nblue cue-lights were 218 (5) and 221 (5) ms, respectively. \n \nTo summarize, Experiment 2 revealed the near-effect when responses were \nmade with the hand near the viewer, even when a passive hand was positioned at the \nsame depth as the far LED. The finding that the near-effect was absent when the \nresponse hand was placed at the far target depth, despite a passive hand placed at the \nnear depth, seems to suggest that shifts of attention were not affected by the passive \nhand. The effect of the responding hand at the far target depth was restricted to the \ncondition where shifts of attention were made from the invalidly cued near location to \nthe far target LED. Consistent with the results of Experiment 1, detection times to \nvalid cued targets and to invalid cued targets presented at the near location were not \naffected by response hand position. As the location of both hands was the same for the \nduration of the testing session in Experiment 2, it is unlikely that the abolishment of \nthe near-effect in Experiment 1 was associated with differential attentional saliency \neffects due to dissimilar visual scenes. Hand-dominance was shown not to be a \nrelevant factor either, as the effect of the response hand at the far location was the \nsame for right and left handed responses.  \nThe finding that the response hand effect on the reorienting bias was not \ninfluenced by the presence of an additional passive hand does not necessarily imply \nthat spatial attention was not influenced by the passive hand. Reed et al. (2006) \n 18\nP107RA \nshowed that when attention is cued along the horizontal dimension and only the non-\nresponding hand is horizontally aligned with one of the two target locations, spatial \nattention is biased towards this hand\u2019s location, resulting in an overall benefit in \ndetection times to the proximal target (independent from cue-validity). In Experiment \n2 of the present study, detection times to valid targets, and to invalid cued targets at \nthe near target location did not vary as a function of passive hand position. This \nfinding could suggest that the passive hand was not prioritized for spatial attention, or \nalternatively, that passive hand effect on spatial attention can only be revealed when \npotentially more dominant effects of the responding hand are eliminated. Experiment \n3 aims to investigate whether passive hand influences on spatial attention were \nmasked by effects of the response hand in Experiment 2. The non-responding hand is \nplaced at either the near or far target depth whilst the responding hand is moved away \nfrom the target scene. If alignment in depth of the passive hand and the target is \nsufficient for attention to be prioritized to the passive hand in the depth cueing task, \nthen an overall detection time bias (independent from cue-validity) may be revealed at \nthe target location most proximal to passive hand, in line with the attentional \nprioritization effect observed in horizontal cueing tasks (Reed et al., 2006).  \n \nEXPERIMENT 3 \n \nMETHOD \n \nSixteen participants were recruited for Experiment 3 (mean age was 22, sd = \n4.8). All participants were right handed and had normal or to normal corrected vision \nwithout any reported problems with colour vision or depth perception. \n 19\nP107RA \n The following modifications to the experimental procedure of Experiment 2 \nwere made for Experiment 3: All participants responded by pressing a response key \nplaced on the table below the rail close to the viewer (actual distance between the \nhand and the near target light was \u223c52 cm, distance in depth between the hand and the \nnear LED was 17.5 cm, horizontal distance was 10 cm, vertical distance 50). The \nother hand was placed on either the near or far button-box placed on the rail \n(depending on the condition) but was never used for responding. Due to malfunction, \ntwo LEDs had to be replaced. Luminance of the cue-lights and target lights were \nadjusted to 24 CD\/m2 for the green and blue cue-lights, and 54 CD\/m2 for the red \ntarget lights. Eight participants responded with their left hand and placed the right \nhand on the button box fixed at either the near or far target depth. The remaining 8 \nparticipants responded with their right hand and placed the left hand on the button box \nclose to either the near or far LED. The experimental task consisted of 4 blocks of 240 \ntrials. For eight participants, the passive hand was placed on the button box at the far \ntarget depth during the first two blocks and at the near depth during the last two \nblocks. This order was reversed for the remaining eight participants. The target \ncontrol task was presented after the first two blocks and at the end of the experimental \ntask.  \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nDepth cueing task: Means of median RT were entered in a Mixed Repeated \nMeasures ANOVA, with the factors Target Location, Cue and Passive Hand Position \n(PHP: near vs. far). The factor Hand (responses made with either the left or right \nhand) was entered as the between subject factor. Significant main effects were found \n 20\nP107RA \nfor the factors Cue [F(1,14) = 41.5; p < 0.001] and Target Location [F(1,14) = 35.9; p \n< 0.001]. The interaction effect between Cue and Target Location was also significant \n[F(1,14) = 23.7; p < 0.001]. Post-hoc analysis showed that the effect of Cue was \nsignificant at both target locations (p < 0.001), and that the effect of Target Location \nwas significant in both Cue conditions (p \u2264 0.04). Pair-wise comparisons of the \ndifference values (RT invalid \u2013 RT valid) as a function of Target Location showed \nthat the effect of cueing was significantly greater at the far compared to the near target \nlocation [t(15) = 5.04; p < 0.001]. Most important was the findings that the three-way \ninteraction effect between Cue, Target Location and PHP was not significant [F < 1], \nsuggesting that the asymmetric cueing effect was comparable in both PHP conditions.  \n \n \n   [Figure 4 here] \n \n Control tasks: The Target Control Task was analysed with the factors PHP \n(near vs. far), Target Location and with the between subjects factor Hand (responding \nwith right vs. left hand). The effect of Target Location was significant [F(1,14) = 5.7; \np = 0.032], but the interaction effect between Target Location and PHP was not [F < \n1]. Mean RT to near and far targets (SE in brackets) were 248 (8) and 260 (9) ms \n(respectively) in the PH-near condition, and 244 (8) and 254 (7) ms (respectively) in \nthe PH-far condition. All remaining effects were also not significant [PHP: [F(1,14) = \n2.1; p = 0.16; Hand: F < 1; PHP x Hand: F < 1], suggesting that neither hand-\ndominance nor the position of the passive hand influenced detection times in the \nTarget Control task. Analysis of the Cue Control Task with the factors Cue-light and \n 21\nP107RA \nResponse Hand (left vs. right) revealed non-significant results for all three effects [F \n< 1]. Mean RT to green and blue cue-lights were 222 (7) and 223 (6) ms, respectively. \n \nFurther analysis \n \nTarget Location effects: The difference between RT to valid far and valid near \ntargets was consistent across all three experiments, irrespective of response-hand or \npassive-hand position. The assumption was that this difference is associated with the \ndifferent sizes of the retinal regions covered by the near and far target light \n(approximately twice as large for the near light), as suggested by the effect of Target \nLocation in the Target Control task. To establish if the Target Location effect \nobserved on valid trials in the depth cueing task is comparable to the effect of Target \nLocation in the Target Control task, RT to valid cued trials and to targets in the Target \nControl task were analysed with the factors Target Location (near vs. far) and Task \n(Valid cued condition in the depth cueing task vs. Control task), separately for each \nExperiment. Significant results were found for the effect of Target Location in all \nthree Experiments [F \u2265 10.39; p \u2264 0.006] and for the effect of Task in Experiments 1 \nand 3 [F \u2265 7.8; p \u2264 0.013] (faster RT to targets in the control task), although the latter \neffect was not significant in Experiment 2 [F(1,15) = 3.51; p = 0.081]. Most important \nwas the finding that the interaction effect between Task and Target Location was not \nsignificant [F < 1 in all three Experiments], suggesting that difference in detection \ntimes for near and far targets was the same in the Target Control task and on valid \ncued trials in the depth cueing task. \nThe near-effect across Experiments: A final analysis on RT was conducted to \nexplore if the cueing effect, and the \u2018near-effect\u2019 (Cue x Target Location) was \n 22\nP107RA \ncomparable in all conditions where the response hand was placed near the viewer, \nwhether a passive hand was placed in proximity to the far target LED (Experiments 2 \nand 3) or not (Experiment 1). ANOVA was used with the factors Cue and Target \nLocation. The factor \u2018Experiment\u2019 was entered as the between subjects factor. Results \nof this analysis revealed significant main effects of Target Location [F(1,43) = 77; p < \n0.001], Cue [F(1,43); p < 0.001], and a significant effect of Cue x Target Location \n[F(1,43) = 36.7; p < 0.001], consistent with the main analyses per Experiment. The \nmain effect of Experiment was not significant [F(1,43) = 1.8; p = 0.17], and, more \ncrucially, the interaction effects between Experiment, Cue and Target Location was \nalso not significant [F(1,43) = 1.6; p = 0.21]. The latter result suggests that the passive \nhand at the far location did not modulate the near-bias in reorienting of attention when \nthe response hand was placed near the viewer. \nErrors: Percentage trials rejected based on the amplitude cut-off was 5.92% \nand 6.12% in the Response-hand \u2018far\u2019 conditions (for Experiment 1 and 2, \nrespectively), and 5.45% and 6% in the Response-hand \u2018near\u2019 conditions (Experiment \n1 and 2, respectively). For Experiment 3, Percentage trials rejected was 4.76% and \n5.32% for the Passive Hand \u2018Far\u2019 and \u2018Near\u2019 conditions, respectively. Omissions and \nAnticipatory errors were made infrequently (less than 2% across all conditions in all \nthree Experiments). As the variance in several conditions was zero or close to zero for \nall three types of errors, only main effects were analysed for each Experiment. \nAnalysis of percentage eye-movement trials, omissions and anticipations revealed \nnon-significant results for all comparisons in all three Experiments (t \u2264 1.5; p \u2265 0.14).  \n \nIn sum, placement of only a passive hand at either the near or far target depth \ndid not affect detection times in Experiment 3. It is therefore unlikely that the absence \n 23\nP107RA \nof possible attentional prioritization effects associated with the passive hand were \nsomehow masked by more dominant response-hand effects in Experiment 2. The \npresence of the near-effect in both passive hand position conditions supports the idea \nthat the response requirement of the hand at the far target location is crucial for the \nabolishment of the reorienting bias to occur. Irrelevance of passive hand position for \nshifts of attention in the present study is further supported by analysis across \nexperiment, showing that the near-effect was not significantly influenced by the \npresence (Experiment 2 and 3) or absence (Experiment 1) of a passive hand at the far \ndepth when the response hand was placed near the viewer.  \nResponse times to near targets were consistently faster than to targets emitted \nfrom the far LED in the depth cueing task. Although this difference could be \ninterpreted as a general viewer-centred bias in endogenous shifts of attention to all \ntargets presented in viewer-centred near space, it is more likely that the effect is \nassociated with the different retinal sizes of the two stimuli. The target location effect \nobserved on valid cued trials was comparable to the location effect in the control task, \nwhere endogenous shifts of attention are not required. Further support for this \nassumption can be inferred from Gawryszewski et al.\u2019s study (1987) who adjusted the \nsize of the target lights for distance from the viewer in a depth cueing task and found \nno location effect in response times to valid cued targets. Both findings seem \ninconsistent with the idea that voluntary shifts of attention may be biased to all targets \nnear the viewer. \n \n \n 24\nP107RA \nGENERAL DISCUSSION \n \nThe aim of the present study was to investigate whether the near-effect, \npreviously associated with a 3D viewer-centred reorienting bias to near space, could \nbe explained in terms of a bias to the responding hand, always positioned near the \nviewer in previous studies investigating spatial attention in real depth situations. The \nresults of Experiment 1 excluded this explanation, as the near-effect was not reversed \nto a far-bias when the hand was positioned at the far depth. Instead the hand reduced \ndetection time \u2018cost\u2019 associated with reorienting of attention from the near to the far \ntarget location, resulting in symmetric effects of cueing at the near and far LED. \nShifting attention in response to valid depth cues was left unaffected by response-\nhand position, as was reorienting of attention from the far to the near target location. \nExperiment 2 and 3 further showed that the response requirement was crucial for the \nhand-effect to occur. Placement of only a passive hand at one of the target locations \nhad no effect on detection times (Experiment 3), and placing a passive hand at the \ntarget depth not occupied by the responding hand did not influence the effect of the \nresponse-hand on the reorienting bias (Experiment 2).   \nOne aspect of our results that may seem inconsistent with Reed et al.\u2019s (2006) \nfindings (who cued attention along the horizontal dimension) is the absence of any \npassive-hand position effect on detection times in the depth cueing task. Although this \ncould suggest that attentional prioritization of the passive hand is restricted to \nsituations where attention is cued along the horizontal dimension, an alternative \nexplanation may be that this inconsistency is related to the difference in proximity \nbetween the passive hand and the target stimulus in the two studies. The passive hand \nwas proximal to the target along all three dimensions in the Reed et al.\u2019s study, \n 25\nP107RA \nwhereas the vertical distance between the response key and the LED was 9 cm in the \ndepth cueing task. Reed et al. (2006) showed that the attentional prioritization effect \ndepends on close proximity between the target and the hand (as the effect was not \nobserved when the distance was 11 cm), consistent with the idea that the attentional \nprioritization effect reflects modulation of spatial attention within a bimodal (visual-\ntactile) hand-centred spatial representation (Graziano & Gross, 1995; Fogassi, \nGallese, Fadiga, Luppino, Mattelli & Rizolatti, 1996; Duhamel, Colby & Goldberg, \n1998). Whether an overall bias in spatial attention to the passive hand would have \nbeen detected if the hand had been more proximal to the target cannot be excluded. It \nremains clear however, that the position of the passive hand cannot account for the \npresence or absence of the near-effect in the depth cueing task. \n  Although the present findings clearly suggest that the response requirement is \na necessary condition for hand-position effects to occur in the depth cueing task, it is \nless clear whether spatial attention was modulated within 3D viewer-centred or within \na hand-centred spatial representation. Gawryszewski et al (1987) originally explained \nthe near-effect as reflecting 3D viewer-centred enhancement of spatial attention in the \nregion between the viewer and fixation after cueing of the near LED, resulting in \nprolonged detection time when reorienting of attention to the far target location is \nrequired. When the far LED is cued, the attentional focus is shifted to the far target \nlocation and attention spreads towards the viewer, resulting in equal awareness of all \ninformation within this viewer-centred area of space. One possible explanation within \nthis framework for the abolishment of the near-effect is that the 3D viewer-centred \nattentional space is extended to the depth of the far response hand on all trials during \nresponse preparation, even when attention is initially cued to the near LED. This \nwould result in equal awareness of both target locations when the target is presented \n 26\nP107RA \nand could account for the symmetric cueing effects when the hand is positioned at the \nfar depth. An alternative explanation for the response-hand effect is that a hand-\ncentred spatial representation is accessed when preparing the manual response in \naddition to an already active 3D viewer-centred representation. When the hand is \nplaced at the far position and attention is cued to the near LED, response preparation \nmay enhance spatial awareness around the hand to an equal level of the attentional \nspace created within a 3D viewer-centred spatial representation between the viewer \nand fixation. Assuming that the attended region around the hand includes the target \nLED, the pattern of results across the two hand-position conditions would reflect \nadditive influences of viewer-centred and hand-centred spatial representations on \nspatial attention in this explanation.   \nWhilst both explanations could account for the abolishment of the near-effect \nby the response hand at the far target depth, it could be argued that the two \nexplanations would predict different results on valid cued trials. Consistent with the \nobserved pattern of results, the 3D viewer-centred explanation would predict that \nvalid cue conditions should be left unaffected by hand-position as the cued locations \nalways fall within attended space, whether the hand is positioned close to the near or \nthe far LED. In contrast, if spatial attention is enhanced within both spatial \nrepresentations, additive effects of the response hand would be expected in all \nconditions, including valid cued trials. The only caveat would be if spatial attention \nwas maximally enhanced within a viewer-centred spatial representation in terms of \nobservable behavioural effects. A few neuropsychological findings have previously \nbeen explained in this way (e.g., Frassinetti, Rossi & L\u00e0davas, 2001; Mattingley et al., \n1998). Mattingley et al. (1998) showed for example that spatial awareness of stimuli \npresented in right space was not further enhanced by right-handed trial-initiating key-\n 27\nP107RA \npresses in a patient with left visual extinction. Although spatial awareness in these \nstudies was predominantly measured in terms of the number of stimuli reported, \ndetection times may be similarly restricted in their sensitivity to uncover additional \neffects of the response hand. While this question clearly requires further investigation, \nadditive effects in attention (e.g. location-based and object-based attention) have been \nsuccessfully revealed within the third dimension using manual response times as the \nbehavioural measure (Bourke et al., 2006).  \nEven though the specific pattern of results observed in the present study seems \nmost consistent with a 3D viewer-centred explanation for the abolishment of the near-\neffect, this preliminary conclusion may warrant further verification in future studies, \nparticularly given the accumulating evidence for modulation of attention from hand-\ncentred representations in peripersonal space. One question raised by the present \nfindings is whether the beneficial effect of the response hand at the far target depth is \nrestricted to situations where the response hand is aligned with the direction of the \nviewer\u2019s gaze. It may be possible that the \u2018boundary\u2019 of 3D viewer-centred \nenhancement in spatial attention returns to fixation when the response hand at the far \ntarget depth is moved further away from gaze direction. When the hand is positioned \nclose to a target in the periphery, proprioceptive information received from the hand \nand limb may become more relevant for determining the location of the hand for \nshifts of attention to response hand, previously associated with response preparation \n(Eimer et al., 2005; Eimer & van Velzen, 2006). Adding LEDs to the left and right \ncould allow investigation of the relative importance of these two types of information \nabout hand position. The potential influence of a (bimodal) hand-centred \nrepresentation on shift of attention may result in horizontal biases when the hand is \n 28\nP107RA \nplaced in the periphery, instead of (or possibly in addition to) a 3D viewer-centred \nreorienting bias to near space.  \nA second question that could be investigated further is whether the influence \nof hand-centred representations on spatial attention could be manipulated by the \ncomplexity of the manual response. Studies investigating the effect of reaching \nresponses on spatial attention have shown that reaching seems to be associated with \naction-based shifts of attention to the starting position of the hand (Tipper, Lortie & \nBaylis, 1992). In a study investigating distractor interference on reaching response \ntimes, Tipper et al. (1992) showed that response time interference was strongest from \ndistractors presented at locations in the middle and front of the 3D target display when \nthe starting position was close to the observer. More crucially, this effect reversed \nwhen the hand was positioned beyond all stimuli, with stronger interference from \ndistractors furthest from the viewer but closest to the starting position of the reaching \nhand. Interference from distractors close to the hand have also been shown to affect \nreaching trajectories (e.g., deviating away from the distractors), supporting the \nassumption that distractor inhibition operates on representations centred on the hand \nin goal-directed reaching (Tipper, Howard & Jackson, 1997). Perhaps a similar \naction-based bias to the far hand could be revealed when the behavioural response \nrequires movement planning in the depth cueing task. \nIn conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that the near-effect \nobserved in the depth cueing task can be eliminated by placing a response hand close \nto the far target location. As the hand only influenced spatial attention when used for \nresponding (and not when passively placed at the far target depth), the abolishment of \nthe near-effect seems to be associated with preparation of the manual response, \nresulting in equal spatial awareness of the near and far target location when the hand \n 29\nP107RA \nis positioned at the far depth. The pattern of results across the three experiments is \nmost consistent with the idea that spatial attention can be modulated by the response-\nhand within a 3D viewer-centred spatial representation when the hand is aligned with \nthe direction of gaze. \n \n Anderson, G.
