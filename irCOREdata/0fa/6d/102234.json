Xiao and D. M. Heyes\nDepartment of Chemistry, School of Physical Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford GU2 5XH, United Kingdom\n~Received 22 February 1999!\nThe effects of segment-segment interactions on the static and dynamical properties of model polymer\nsolutions are examined by Brownian dynamics simulations in the free-draining limit over a wide concentration\nrange. A bead-and-spring model is used to describe the polymer chains at a coarse-grained level, in which\nsegment-segment interactions are represented by a bead-bead pair potential with a Gaussian analytic form,\nbuev(r)5A exp(2r2\/2s2), where b51\/kBT and A and s are characteristic energy and distance scales, respec-\ntively. The chain dimensions, self-diffusion coefficient, and viscosity of the systems are studied as functions of\nnumber density of beads of the system, r, at given excluded-volume potential parameters, A and s. Our results\nshow that in the limit of infinite dilution even for short chains (N;10) there is statistically significant scaling\nbehavior in the static and dynamical properties. For a system with given values of A and s the change in\npolymer coil size shows a realistic trend as the concentration of the system increases. In the dilute and\nconcentrated regions the coil size decreases as a result of increasing interchain repulsions, while in the highly\nconcentrated region the coil size increases again, showing a return to Rouse-like behavior because the in-\ntrapolymer and interpolymer segment-segment interactions become effectively indistinguishable for an arbi-\ntrary bead and to a large extent are \u2018\u2018balanced out.\u2019\u2019 In the limit of infinite dilution, the self-diffusion coeffi-\ncient of the center of mass, Dcm , depends on N only and not on the potential parameter A, while in contrast the\nspecific viscosity hsp depends on both N and A. As the concentration increases Dcm decreases and hsp increases\nconsistent with the behavior of real polymers. When the system becomes highly concentrated, however, both\nDcm and hsp unrealistically return to the Rouse limit. This suggests that from the concentrated region upward\nin concentration, the entanglement or the topological constraints caused by the physical connectivity of the\nchains significantly influence their dynamical behavior. The mean-field segment-segment interactions or\nexcluded-volume effects incorporated in the current coarse-grained bead-spring approach cannot capture this\nentanglement effect, and therefore give rise to unrealistic dynamical behavior in the concentrated regime.\n@S1063-651X~99!05911-5#\nPACS number~s!: 61.25.HqI. INTRODUCTION\nPolymer chains in solution exhibit many interesting struc-\ntural and rheological features in different concentration re-\ngions. Experiments show that despite the complexity of poly-\nmers and a wide variation in atom-level detail, their\nmacroscopic\/coarse-grained behavior follows universal scal-\ning laws @1\u20136#. This is the case even for biopolymers that\nhave more specific interactions between the backbone and\nside chains of the molecule than synthetic polymers @7\u20139#.\nBased on the observation that the macroscopic behavior of\npolymer molecules is dominated by a characteristic length\nscale of the molecule, various scaling theories have been\nproposed that give coarse-grained predictions for structural\nand dynamical properties in different concentration regions\n@10\u201313#, and which have been confirmed to a large extent by\nboth experiment @14\u201317# and computer simulation @18\u201325#.\nWhile the properties of polymer chains at infinite dilution\nand in the melt state have often been simulated, there is a\nneed for similar studies in the intermediate region for solu-\ntions, where the correlation length of density fluctuations is\ncomparable to the coil size of the polymers, and also at\nhigher concentrations approaching the melt limit. In this\nstudy we have carried out Brownian dynamics simulations\nfor a system of bead-and-spring chains in this concentrationPRE 601063-651X\/99\/60~5!\/5757~11!\/$15.00range as well as at infinite dilution.\nThe physical properties of a polymer solution are deter-\nmined by at least four features of the polymer molecules: ~a!\nthe connectivity of the backbone, ~b! the segment-segment\ninteractions, ~c! the hydrodynamic interactions ~HI! between\npolymer segments and solvent molecules, and ~d! the un-\ncrossability of the chains, which cause entanglement at the\nmolecular level. While it could reasonably be argued that\nmany-body hydodynamic interactions can be neglected at\nhigh concentrations and entanglement in dilute solution, the\nconnectivity of the backbone and the segment-segment inter-\nactions are effective throughout the whole concentration re-\ngion. In this study we have focused on the connectivity and\nthe segment-segment interactions to investigate their contri-\nbution to both structural and dynamical properties of poly-\nmer chains in solution. Also, the absence of true molecular-\nlevel topological entanglement in our model allows us to\ndraw some conclusions as to its possible consequences.\nThe simplest model to describe the connectivity of a poly-\nmer chain is the Rouse model @26#, in which a polymer chain\nis described in terms of a set of N beads linked sequentially\nby N21 linear springs with a potential bu(l)5 32 l2, where\nb51\/kBT and l is the spring bond vector between two linked\nbeads. Although the spring potentials enable correlated\nmovements of the beads along the chain, the beads are not\nphysically linked and the chains can cross each other freely.5757 \u00a9 1999 The American Physical Society\n5758 PRE 60C. XIAO AND D. M. HEYESExcluded volume ~EV! has been introduced in the form of\nbead-bead interactions to prevent two beads from occupying\nthe same space @27\u201329#. However, the way the EV potential\nis defined means that it reflects both the chain chemistry and\nthe solvent quality, Fev5F01Fm , where F0 is the repulsive\nforce between any two unlinked beads when the chains are in\nvacuum and Fm is the solvent mediation force caused by the\nbead-solvent interactions when the chains are immersed in a\nsolvent. Obviously, F0 depends on the molecular details of\nthe chain. The stronger the F0 , the stiffer the chain. Fm de-\npends on the affinity of the chains towards the solvent. If the\nbead-solvent interactions tend to pull the beads apart, Fm is\nrepulsive; otherwise it is attractive. The total force, the so-\ncalled \u2018\u2018excluded-volume force,\u2019\u2019 determines the quality of\nthe solvent for a given polymer. In a good solvent, Fev.0\nand the repulsions keep the beads further apart than for the\nRouse chains. In a bad solvent, Fev,0 and the beads are\nforced together, causing the chains to tend to collapse. In a u\nsolvent, Fev50, there are no net forces between unlinked\nbeads, and the chains reduce to Rouse chains. The conse-\nquences of the total force Fev is called the excluded-volume\n~EV! effect.\nThe EV force plays an important role in polymer solu-\ntions and this can be represented by a simple pair potential\nbetween the beads. From a theoretical point of view, the\neffects of the analytical form of the EV potential on the\nstructural and dynamical properties of these systems are\nlargely unknown. In this work we propose a model EV po-\ntential and have carried out Brownian dynamics ~BD! simu-\nlations on these model polymer solutions to examine its ef-\nfect on the behavior of polymer chains in solution. We\nexplore the statistical distribution of the chain segments, the\ndiffusion coefficient of the center of mass, and the viscosity.\nWe have investigated a wide concentration range spanning\neither side of the chain overlap concentration, r*, which we\nwill define precisely below.\nII. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND\nConsider a solution of Nch bead-spring chains in a volume\nV with spring potential usp(Dl) and EV potential uev(r). Let\nl be the spring bond vector between any two linked beads, r\nthe distance between any two unlinked beads, and Dl5l\n2l0 , with the subscript 0 indicating the natural state of the\nspring. The number density of the chains in the system is\nrch[Nch \/V and the number density of beads is r\n[NNch \/V , where N is the number of beads per chain.\nIn a u solvent, if the many-body hydrodynamic interac-\ntions ~MHI! are neglected, the chains behave like Rouse\nchains. In a good solvent, however, the EV interactions are\ninfluential. At extreme dilution, the chains are essentially\nisolated, and therefore intrachain EV effects dominate, al-\nthough chains do interact occasionally because of their open\nstructure. The intrachain EV effect pushes the beads away\nfrom each other, causing the chain to swell. The chains form\nlarger coils than in a u solvent. As the solution becomes\nmore concentrated, the chains increasingly interact with and\ninterpenetrate each other so that the interactions between the\nbeads from different chains become more important. For any\nbead on a given chain it increasingly experiences the effects\nof beads from other chains. As a result, the intrachain EVeffect becomes less important and the chains shrink. When\nthe system becomes highly concentrated, the system is more\nhomogeneous and the density fluctuations decrease in mag-\nnitude. On average, the forces on each bead tend to balance\nout because of the high level of occupation of the first coor-\ndination shell. The beads begin to lose awareness of the con-\nnectivity of the chains since, because the beads are packed\nclosely together, it is difficult for any particular bead to dis-\ntinguish which chains other beads belong to. The net force\non a given bead exerted by the surrounding beads tends to\nzero and the chains become, in the limit of the melt, Rouse-\nlike chains again.\nWe will term the region where intrachain repulsions\ndominate as \u2018\u2018dilute,\u2019\u2019 the region where interchain repulsions\ndominate as \u2018\u2018concentrated,\u2019\u2019 and the region where intrac-\nhain and interchain repulsions are undistinguishable as\n\u2018\u2018highly concentrated.\u2019\u2019 In the beginning of the concentrated\nrange, there is a region where the chain density rch is still\nvery low despite the high bead density r. This region is\ncalled \u2018\u2018semidilute.\u2019\u2019 The longer the chains, the more ex-\ntended the semidilute region.\nWe can define an overlap density,\nr*[\nN\n4\n3 pRgyr\n3\nwhere Rgyr is the root-mean-square radius of gyration of the\npolymer chains at r* ~which is quite close to the infinite\ndilution value!. This is the number density of beads when\nchains start to overlap, providing a geometrical prescription\nfor the transition from dilute region to concentrated region.\nThe open structure of the chain molecules ensures that once\nthe system leaves the limit of infinite dilution, the interchain\ninteractions gradually increase so that r* does not represent\na phase transition.\nThere are various theories attempting to explain the be-\nhavior of polymer solutions in these different concentration\nranges. While theories for infinite dilute systems and the\nmelt are very successful, more needs to be done for the con-\ncentrated region. We summarize here some established scal-\ning laws so that we can conveniently compare our simulation\nresults with them @30#. We denote the root-mean-square\nbond length (^l2&)1\/2 as b, and the position vector of bead j\nas Rj . In the limit of infinite dilution we have the following\nrelations. The mean-square distance between any two beads\nm and n on the same chain, Smn\n2\n, is\nSmn\n2 [^~Rn2Rm!2&}um2nu2nb2, ~1!\nwhere n is an exponent that depends on the solvent quality.\nThe mean-square radius of gyration, Rgyr\n2\n, is\nRgyr\n2 [\n1\nN (j51\nN\n^~Rj2Rcm!2&}N2nb2 ~2!\nwhere Rcm is the position of the center of mass of the chain\ndefined by\nRcm[\n1\nN (j51\nN\nRj . ~3!\nPRE 60 5759EFFECTS OF BEAD-BEAD INTERACTIONS ON THE . . .Turning now to dynamical properties, the self-diffusion\ncoefficient for the center of mass of the chain, Dcm , is\nDcm[ lim\nt\u21920\n1\n6t ^@Rcm~ t !2Rcm~0 !#\n2&}N2nD, ~4!\nwhere nD is a characteristic exponent for Dcm . Let h be the\nviscosity of the solution and hs that of the pure solvent. For\nthe intrinsic viscosity, @h#, we have\n@h#[ lim\nr\u21920\nh2hs\nhsr\n}Nnhb2, ~5!\nwhere nh is the associated scaling exponent. The values for\nthese exponents in some well defined limits are as follows:\nn5 H 0.5, Rouse chains ~u solvent!0.588, self-avoiding chains ~good solvent!; ~6!\nnD5 H 1, Rouse modeln , Zimm model, ~7!\nnh5 H 1, Rouse model3n21, Zimm model. ~8!\nThe above results are calculated from self-avoiding\nchains, for which the EV potential is taken as a delta func-\ntion. In a u solvent, self-avoiding chains become Rouse\nchains. If we take into account many-body hydrodynamic\ninteractions in self-avoiding chains, we obtain the Zimm\nmodel @31#. It is important to include MHI effects to obtain\nrealistic values for the dynamic scaling exponents nD and\nnh . If we take the value 0.6 for n, the Zimm model values\nagree well with those obtained for real polymers, i.e., nD\n50.5, nh50.5 in a u solvent and nD50.6, nh50.8 in a good\nsolvent. However, the values of the static scaling exponent n\nagree well with real polymers under different solvent condi-\ntions without the need for MHI in the model.\nIn concentrated solutions, the situation becomes more\ncomplicated. Since the concentration fluctuations are still\nlarge and the correlations between segments are strong, a\npolymer solution in the concentrated region assumes critical\nbehavior. The influence of the number density of beads r on\nthe static and dynamic properties of the polymer solution can\nbe analyzed using scaling arguments that in a good solvent\ngive the following predictions for the density dependence of\nthe static and dynamical properties @13,30#:\nagyr[\nRgyr~r!\nRgyr~0 !\n}S rr*D\nk\n, ~9!\nacm[\nDcm~r!\nDcm~0 !\n}S rr*D\nkD\n, ~10!\nhr[\nh~r!\nhs\n}S rr*D\nkh\n, ~11!\nwhere k5(122n)\/2(3n21), kD5(22n)\/(3n21), and\nkh53\/(3n21). For n50.6 we have k520.125, kD\n521.75, and kh53.75, respectively.III. SIMULATION AND MODEL DETAILS\nOur model system consists of Nch linear spring-and-bead\nchains each with N identical beads. The position vector for a\nbead j is Rj , the spring bond vector between any two linked\nbeads is lk[Rk112Rk , and the distance between any two\nunlinked beads is rmn[Rn2Rm . We assume that the\nBrownian forces acting on the beads are uncorrelated and\ntherefore the long-time dynamics of the beads satisfy the\nposition Langevin equation @32,33#. Neglecting many-body\nhydrodynamic interactions, we have for bead j a bead posi-\ntion update scheme in a form convenient for simulation @34#,\nRj~ t1Dt !5Rj~ t !1Fj~ t !\nDt\nz\n1DRj\nG~ t !, ~12!\nwhere z is the friction coefficient of the bead characterizing\nthe bead-solvent interaction, and DRj\nG is a random Brownian\ndisplacement acting on bead j taken from a Gaussian random\nnumber generator. The thermodynamic or excluded-volume\nforce Fj on a bead is determined by the potential field of the\nsystem, which here has two parts\u2014the sum of the spring\nforces from the two beads linked to it and the sum of the EV\nforces from all the unlinked beads around it.\nTwo analytic forms of spring potential were used in our\nsimulations. For the class of systems denoted by the key, F0,\nwe used a linear spring with zero natural length i.e., l0\n50.0 so that Dl5l and the interaction potential was,\nbu~ l !5\nH\n2 l\n2\n, ~13!\nwhere H is a characteristic energy. This is the spring poten-\ntial used in the Rouse model. For the class of systems de-\nnoted by F1, we use a finitely extendible nonlinear elastic\n~FENE! spring model @35# that has a nonzero equilibrium\nnatural length l0 and a maximum extension Dlmax ,\nbu~Dl !52\nH\n2 Dlmax\n2 lnS 12 Dl2Dlmax2 D , ~14!\nwhere Dl5ul2l0u. We used the values H53.0 and Dlmax\n53.0l0 in this study. The FENE spring potential for F1 sys-\ntems guarantees that the springs do not get overstretched at\nhigh concentrations. In the limit Dl\u21920 the FENE potential\nreduces to a linear harmonic spring interaction potential,\nbu(Dl)5 32 Dl2.\nTurning now to the nonbonded interaction, the EV poten-\ntial we used had a Gaussian analytical form,\nbuev~r !5H Ae2r2\/2s2, r,4s0, r>4s , ~15!\nwhere s sets the range of the potential and A the energy scale\nor strength of the interaction. Despite this seemingly arbi-\ntrary choice, it is a plausible potential form, since it allows\nfor progressively more difficult interpenetration of the beads\nas the values of A and s increase. The barrier height at r\n50 is finite, however. This is a realistic feature, because\neach bead represents a substantial section of a polymer chain.\nThe dimensionless exponential prefactor A reflects the qual-\nity of the solvent. A<0 represents a system of polymer\n5760 PRE 60C. XIAO AND D. M. HEYESchains in a bad solvent, A50 the chains in a u solvent, and\nA.0 the chains in a good solvent.\nThe strength and the interaction range of the spring po-\ntential and the EV potential ~on the left! are shown in Fig. 1.\nWe can see that the FENE potential prevents the bead-bead\nbond length from becoming too elongated.\nFrom the positions and forces we can calculate the spe-\ncific viscosity of the system using the appropriate Green-\nKubo formula @36#,\nhsp[\nh2hs\nhs\n5\nb\nhsV\nE\n0\n\u2018\n@^Jab~0 !Jab~ t !&\n2^Js\nab~0 !Js\nab~ t !&#dt , ~16!\nwhere V is the volume of the system and Jab is an off-\ndiagonal component of the momentum flux tensor J which is\nrelated to the pressure tensor P by J5VP. The ~s-s! integral\ninvolving the second term on the right-hand side represents\nthe contribution from the solvent alone.

Only the\nfirst ~p-p! polymer contribution in Eq. ~17! is important in\nthis context, since we assume in our model that there is no\ncorrelation between the polymer and the solvent. Therefore,\nthe ~p-0! and ~0-p! terms are statistically zero. Also, we can\nFIG. 1.

COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS\nBD simulations were carried out for both F0 and F1\nsystems with varying EV strengths A, different chain lengths\nN, and at a series of concentrations. During the simulation\nthe following quantities were set to unity for computational\nconvenience: the thermal energy kBT , the friction coefficient\nz, mass of the bead m, viscosity of the solvent hs , the root-\nmean-square bond length b of the Rouse chain, and the natu-\nral spring bond length l0 for the F1 potential model. All\nother quantities are in reduced units. In such a case, the time\nstep for the simulation is proportional to the mean-square\nrandom displacement of a bead,\nDt5\n1\n2 ^~DRia\nG !2&. ~21!\nAfter several exploratory simulations, we chose\n^(DRiaG )2&50.05 for most of the concentrations. However,\nfor highly concentrated systems, i.e., r.35.0, ^(DRiaG )2&\n50.04 was used to employ smaller time steps. The number\nof chains in the system was typically Nch520 for dilute sys-\ntems and set to different values from Nch540 to Nch5200\nfor concentrated systems. A typical simulation that gave ad-\nequate statistics lasted for about four million time steps.\nV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nOur model EV potential given in Eq. ~15! had two adjust-\nable parameters, which we call the affinity factor A and the\npotential range s. The former determines the quality of the\nsolvent and the latter determines, among other things, the\nstiffness of the chain. To examine the behavior of flexible\nchains in solutions of finite concentration, we need to make\nsure that the parameters are suitably chosen so that our sys-\ntem represents flexible chains in a good solvent. We carried\nout exploratory simulations in the limit of infinite dilution to\ndetermine these parameters. Also, an appropriate value of N,\nthe number of beads per chain, had to be chosen such that the\nchains were polymerlike and yet not too computationally ex-\npensive to calculate.\nPRE 60 5761EFFECTS OF BEAD-BEAD INTERACTIONS ON THE . . .The value of the scaling exponent n in Eq. ~2! reflects the\nstiffness of the chain. In a good solvent, n.0.8, indicates a\nstiff chain. We performed a number of simulations using the\nmodel F0 potential type with different A and s values. The\nvalues of the scaling exponent n obtained from these simu-\nlations with the different potential parameters are listed in\nTable I. In a u solvent, the calculated value of n was, within\nstatistical uncertainty, the Rouse value of 0.5, as expected.\nFor s50.25, as the affinity factor A increases from 1.0 to\n75.0, the value of n increased from 0.56 to 0.63, reflecting\nthe behavior of flexible chains as the quality of the solvent\nimproves. For the case A51.0 and s51.0 we have n\n50.794, which indicates that the chains were relatively stiff.\nThe effect of s on the scaling behavior is shown clearly in\nFigs. 2~a! and 2~b!. We used s50.25 in all subsequent simu-\nlations to ensure sufficiently flexible chains throughout this\nstudy.\nIn the following sections we first look at the influences of\nsolvent quality and chain length on the properties of the\npolymer coils in the limit r\u21920. Then we examine the\nchanges in these model polymer solutions brought about by\nincreasing concentration.\nA. Behavior at infinite dilution\nIn the limit of infinite dilution, i.e., r\u21920, there are no\ninteractions between unlinked beads under u conditions and\na flexible polymer chain therefore assumes a Gaussian con-\nformational distribution between any two beads m and n on\nthe chain. In a good solvent, since r\u21920, there are no inter-\nchain excluded-volume interactions so that in this limit the\ndeviation from the Gaussian chain behavior is caused solely\nby intrachain EV interactions. These intrachain EV repul-\nsions push the beads further apart so that the chains form\nlarger coils than in a u solvent. The longer the chain, the\nmore pronounced this intrachain EV effect. Figures 3~a! and\n3~b! show the distribution of the radius of gyration, W(Rgyr),\nas a function of chain length for both systems under u and\ngood solvent conditions. For a given polymer the coil size in\na good solvent is larger than in the u solvent. This difference\nin size is enhanced as the number of beads per chain N in-\ncreases, since the longer chains presumably have greater\nscope for expansion.

Nevertheless, on the whole, the increase in bond\nlength b was small, i.e., ,8% for the F0 series and ,3% for\nthe F1 series. This suggests that the F1 spring potential was\na more realistic representation of the polymer than the Rouse\ninteractions, presumably because segments of a real polymer\nchain are not so easily deformed.\nWithin the statistical uncertainty, the results of our simu-\nlations are in agreement with the scaling laws @Eqs. ~1! and\n~2!# that describe the dimensions of the polymer coils in the\nlimit of infinite dilution.

Although the absolute\nvalues of nh are therefore physically unrealistic, it is inter-\nesting to look at the quantity Dnh[nh2nh(u). For flexible\nreal polymers nh varies in the range 0.5\u20130.8 in good solvents\nwith nh(u)50.5 in u solvent, therefore giving Dnh in the\nrange 0.0;0.3. Our results for both series fall in this range,\nwhich suggests that in the infinite dilution limit the quantity\nDnh is only weakly dependent on the presence of many-\nbody hydrodynamic interactions, and the MHI contribution\nto nh from a polymer chain in a good solvent is the similar to\nthat for a polymer in a u solvent.\nB. Behavior at finite concentrations\nAt finite polymer concentration, the interchain EV forces\nbecome increasingly important. There are three distinguish-\nable regimes. In the dilute region, because of the interchain\nrepulsions, the polymer chains avoid overlap on approach by\nshrinking into slightly smaller coils. As a result, the poly-\nmers behave like isolated coils that only interact occasion-\nally. In the concentrated region, the system becomes more\ncrowded and the coils are forced to overlap for extended\nperiods. They begin to interpenetrate, which reduces the net\neffect of the intrachain repulsion energy. In the highly con-\ncentrated region, the density fluctuations are greatly sup-\npressed and each bead is surrounded by an increasing num-\nber of beads from other chains, reducing its ability to\ndistinguish between beads from the same chain and those\nfrom other chains. The segment-segment interactions tend to\nbecome \u2018\u2018balanced out\u2019\u2019 so that when the system reaches the\nmelt state the chains become conformationally ideal again.\nOur simulation results show these three concentration re-\nTABLE IV.

However, we\nmust bear in mind that in our model the entanglement effect\n~which is caused by physical connectivity of the beads on a\nchain! is not included completely and in the highly concen-\ntrated region we expect the polymers to behave like Rouse\nchains, which is acceptable for the chain conformational dis-\ntribution, but not for the dynamical properties.\n1. Radius of gyration\nThe change in the size of a typical polymer chain as con-\ncentration increases is conveniently characterized by the ra-\ntio agyr(r)[Rgyr(r)\/Rgyr(0), which is shown as a function\nof number density of beads r in Fig. 7. First we consider the\nF1 class system in a moderate solvent ~i.e., A58.0!. In the\ndilute region (r,2.0), the radius of gyration of the coil Rgyr\ndrops steadily as r increases. Entering the concentrated re-\ngion ~ca. 2.0,r,15.0!, Rgyr decreases more dramatically\nand follows the scaling law agyr}rk. In the highly concen-\ntrated region, r.15.0, Rgyr increases with r, indicating a\nreturn to Rouse-like conformational statistics.

In the highly concentrated region,\nsince there are no topological constraints in our systems, the\nvalue of Dcm starts to increase as a result of the decreasing\nimpact of the EV effect, approaching the value characteristic\nof a Rouse chain.

CONCLUSIONS\nA model excluded-volume potential of the form buev(r)\n5A exp(2r2\/2s2) with s50.25 and various values of A is\nshown to give a reasonable description of the segment-\nsegment interactions for flexible polymers in solution over a\nwide concentration range. The simulation results give a clear\npicture of how the segment-segment interactions contribute\nto both static and dynamical properties of a model polymer\nsolution and how these properties change as the system be-\ncomes increasingly concentrated. Comparisons with experi-\nments reveal the strengths and limitations of our model.\nIn the limit of infinite dilution the static and dynamical\nproperties agree quite well with theoretical predictions. In\naddition, the model exhibits the correct behavior for the\nchain dimensions in the whole concentration range as r in-\ncreases. In the dilute region the coil size decreases slowly, in\nthe concentrated region the shrinkage of the coil follows a\nscaling law, and in the highly concentrated region the coil\nsize begins to increase again. The dynamical properties, the\nself-diffusion coefficient of the center of mass, Dcm , the\nrelative viscosity hr , and the specific viscosity hsp also\nshow the correct trends in both dilute and concentrated re-\ngions. In the highly concentrated region, however, there is a\nreturn to Rouse-like behavior\u2014which is not realistic.

Although the\ncontraction of polymer coils in the concentrated region in our\nmodel is more extreme than in a real polymer solution. This\nindicates that in the concentrated region the topological con-\nstraints or entanglements of chains present should restrict\nsignificantly the decrease of coil size with increasing concen-\ntration, which will limit the ability of the polymer molecules\nto contract to avoid the interchain excluded volume repul-\nsions.\nThe entanglement effects influence the dynamical behav-\nior of the chains in the concentrated region and dominate\nthose in the highly concentrated region. In real polymers the\nentanglement makes Dcm decrease more dramatically with\nincreasing concentration. It also makes hsp increase faster in\nthe concentrated region and keep increasing in the highly\nconcentrated region. Clearly, excluded-volume aspects of the\npresent model do not represent the real entanglement effectsoriginating in the uncrossability of the chains, which domi-\nnates the dynamical behavior in the very concentrated state.\nNevertheless, our model does have many satisfactory fea-\ntures, bearing in mind its simplicity and computational effi-\nciency, and should form the basis for future refinements.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nC.X. thanks the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences\nResearch Council of Great Britain ~BB-SRC! for financial\nsupport and for the funding of DIGITAL AlphaStations\nworkstations used to carry out some of these simulations.\nUseful discussions with Dr. R.
