INTRODUCTION\nSENSORLESS control of permanent-magnet (PM) brush-less AC (BLAC) motors is desirable in order to reduce the\nsystem complexity and cost, and to improve reliability. Unlike\nother sensorless control methods whose performance is prob-\nlematic during starting and low-speed operation, signal-injec-\ntion-based sensorless schemes exhibit excellent control perfor-\nmance at standstill and low speeds. However, it was found ex-\nperimentally in [1] that the error in the estimated rotor position\nincreases with the load current, while in [2] it was shown that\na significant error can arise due to the influence of cross-cou-\npling magnetic saturation between the - and -axes. Although\nthe effect of magnetic saturation on the cross coupling in per-\nmanent-magnet brushless machines is well known [3], it is gen-\nerally neglected in the implementation of signal-injection-based\nsensorless control [1], [4].\nThis paper, therefore, presents a simple way to account for\nthe cross-coupling effect. Incremental self- and mutual-induc-\ntance characteristics for use in an improved BLAC motor model\nare obtained by both finite-element analysis and measurements.\nThey are subsequently used in a signal-injection-based sensor-\nless control scheme and a significant reduction in the error in\nthe estimated rotor position is achieved.\nII. MODELING OF CROSS-COUPLING EFFECT IN BLAC MOTOR\nWhen cross coupling between the - and -axes is considered,\nthe voltage equations of a BLAC motor in the rotor reference\n-axis frame are [3]\n(1)\nwhere and are the - and -axis voltages,\ncurrents, and apparent self-inductances, respectively, and\nand are the incremental and -axis\nself and mutual inductances, respectively. is the phase re-\nsistance, is the flux-linkage due to the permanent magnets,\nis the angular rotational speed, and .\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/TMAG.2007.892319\nHigh-frequency signal injection components in (1) can be ap-\nproximated by\n(2)\nwhere and are the high-frequency components\nof the - and -axis voltages and currents, respectively.\nIf the high-frequency signal, , is in-\njected in the -axis, the error in the estimated rotor position, ,\ncan be calculated as\n(3)\nwhere are the high-frequency compo-\nnents of the estimated - and -axis currents,\nand\n.\nWhen in (3) is controlled to be zero,\nthe error in the estimated rotor position will be zero. Therefore,\nthe accuracy of the parameters and directly affects the\nrotor position estimation accuracy. Due to magnetic saturation,\nand both vary with and . The variation can be\nobtained by either finite-element analysis or measurements.\nIII.

The finite-\nelement predicted incremental self and mutual inductances are\ndetermined according to\n(5)\nwhere is the flux linkage due to permanent magnets.\nPractically, the - and -axis incremental self and mutual in-\nductances are measured indirectly from the high-frequency cur-\nrents, and , which flow when the high-frequency\nvoltage is applied to the - and -axes [5]. and are\n0018-9464\/$25.00 \u00a9 2007 IEEE\n \nLI et al.: MODELING OF CROSS-COUPLING MAGNETIC SATURATION 2553\nFig. 1.

Hence,\neither can be used to improve the accuracy of the estimated rotor\nposition. However, interpolation to account for the fact that the\nincremental inductances vary with both and is too com-\nplex to implement on a DSP. Therefore, much simpler approxi-\n2554 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS, VOL. 43, NO. 6, JUNE 2007\nFig. 3. Comparison of predicted and measured ratio of L =L . (a) Pre-\ndicted.

For the machine\nunder consideration,\nfrom finite-element analysis predictions, while the values\ndeduced from measurements are\n.\nThe proposed signal-injection-based sensorless control\nscheme remains essentially similar to that described in [4] in\nwhich -axis cross coupling was neglected. However, the error\nin the estimated rotor position, which is calculated by (3), is\nnow considered. The scheme is implemented on a TMS320C31\nDSP, and a precision encoder is used to measure the actual rotor\nposition, and enable the error to be determined. The frequency\nof the AD sampling, the control loop, and the PWM are all\n5 kHz, and the injected sinusoidal voltage is 35 V, 330 Hz.\nAs shown in Fig. 4(a), when conventional signal-injec-\ntion-based sensorless control is employed, i.e., is\nneglected, the error in the estimated rotor position can be large,\nand depends on both and , the average error in the motor\nunder consideration being 15.4 . When -axis cross coupling\nis accounted for, the accuracy of the estimated rotor position\nis improved significantly, as shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c). For\nexample, the average errors are reduced to 2.4 and 1.5 ,\nrespectively, when the finite-element predicted and measured\n, Fig. 3(a) and (b), are employed, the error being\nslightly smaller when the measured is used since it\naccounts for the end-winding inductances.\nV. CONCLUSION\nAn improved implementation of high-frequency signal injec-\ntion sensorless control of a BLAC motor, which accounts for\ncross-coupling magnetic saturation between the - and -axes,\nhas been demonstrated.
