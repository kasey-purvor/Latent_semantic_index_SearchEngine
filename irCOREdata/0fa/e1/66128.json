INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY\nString theory has made tremendous advances in under-\nstanding the microscopic origins of black hole entropy\n[1,2]. In the original calculations, two different dual de-\nscriptions of a supersymmetric object were considered: a\nweakly coupled description in terms of perturbative strings\nand D-branes and a strongly coupled description as a\nclassical black hole solution. The picture of this black\nhole, as a background for the perturbative string, is essen-\ntially the same as in semiclassical general relativity. We\nhave a singularity in spacetime that is shielded (censored)\nby a horizon. The horizon area determines the Bekenstein-\nHawking entropy SBH \u0005 A4GN : This entropy was success-\nfully reproduced by counting the degenerate supersymmet-\nric vacua in the dual perturbative D-brane description. This\npicture did not provide any understanding of where the\nmicrostates were in the strong-coupling black hole picture:\nsmooth black hole solutions \u2018\u2018have no hair,\u2018\u2018 so the geome-\ntry is entirely determined by the charges [3]. There was,\nhowever, a suggestion that pure states would be dual to\ngeometries which were not smooth at the event horizon [4].\nThe anti\u2013de Sitter\/conformal field theory (AdS\/CFT)\ncorrespondence [5\u20137] provided a deeper understanding\nof the counting of black hole entropy in string theory.\nThe black holes in AdS are identified with the thermal\nensemble in the dual CFT. The CFT was conjectured to\nprovide a fundamental, nonperturbative description of\nstring theory with asymptotically AdS boundary condi-\ntions, so the microstates were fundamentally thought of\nas states in the CFT, and it did not appear that they could be\nthought of as living somewhere in the black hole geometry.\nThe evolution of the states in the CFT is unitary. Certain\nstates can be identified with classical geometries, but as has\nbeen emphasized in e.g. [7,8], the CFT provides a fully\nquantized description, and reproducing the behavior of the\nCFT from a spacetime point of view will in general involve\na sum over bulk geometries.\nIn a series of papers, Mathur and his collaborators have\nchallenged the conventional picture of a black hole in\nstring theory (see [9] for a review). They argue that the\nblack hole geometry is merely a coarse grained description\nof the spacetime, and that each of the eSBH microstates can\nbe identified with a perfectly regular geometry with neither\nhorizon nor singularity [10,11]. The black hole entropy is a\nresult of averaging over these different geometries, which\nproduces an \u2018\u2018effective horizon,\u2018\u2018 which describes the scale\nat which the eSBH individual geometries start to differ from\neach other. They further argue that if a system in an initial\npure state undergoes gravitational collapse, it will produce\none of these smooth geometries, and the real spacetime\ndoes not have a global event horizon, thus avoiding the\ninformation loss paradox associated with outgoing\nHawking radiation [12]. Thus, the idea is that stringy\neffects modify the geometry of spacetime at the event\nhorizon, rather than, as would be expected from the clas-\nsical point of view, at Planck or string distances from the\nsingularity. This is a radical modification of the expected\ngeometry. There are similarities with the correspondence\nprinciple ideas [13], but unlike that picture, there is no\nobvious sense in which the spacetime as seen by an infal-\nling observer will be different. It is difficult to see how the\nsingularity behind the black hole\u2019s event horizon can arise\nfrom a coarse graining over nonsingular geometries.1\nThe evidence for this proposal comes from the construc-\ntion of smooth asymptotically flat geometries in the D1-D5\nsystem that can be identified with individual microstates in\nthe CFT on the world volume of the branes. The theory\nconsidered is type IIB supergravity compactified on S1 \u0002\nT4 with n5 D5-branes wrapping S1 \u0002 T4, and n1 D-strings\nwrapping the S1. The near-horizon geometry is AdS3 \u0002\nS3 \u0002 T4 and has a dual 1\u0006 1 dimensional CFT description\n*Electronic address: vishnu.jejjala@durham.ac.uk\n\u2020Electronic address: o.f.madden@durham.ac.uk\n\u2021Electronic address: S.F.Ross@durham.ac.uk\nxElectronic address: G.L.Titchener@durham.ac.uk\n1Although it may be that most measurements in the dual CFT\nfind it difficult to distinguish between regular geometries and the\nconventional semiclassical picture of a black hole [14].\nPHYSICAL REVIEW D 71, 124030 (2005)\n1550-7998=2005=71(12)=124030(15)$23.00 124030-1 \uf6d9 2005 The American Physical Society\nwith c \u0005 6n1n5. The first such geometries were con-\nstructed in [15,16], and correspond to the Ramond-\nRamond (RR) ground state obtained by spectral flow\nfrom the Neveu-Schwarz\u2013Neveu-Schwarz (NSNS) vac-\nuum state. This was subsequently extended [10,17,18] to\nfind a family of smooth geometries corresponding to the\nwhole family of RR ground states in the CFT. The D1-D5\nsystem via string dualities is the same as a system with n5\nunits of fundamental string winding and n1 units of funda-\nmental string momentum on a circle. The D1-D5 bound\nstate corresponds to a multiwound F-string carrying mo-\nmentum, and the geometries are characterized as functions\nof the displacement of the string in its transverse direc-\ntions. As a test of whether the two-charge system indeed\ndescribes the correct physics, the collision time for left-\nand right-moving excitations on the component string was\ncomputed in field theory and compared to the time for\ngraviton absorption and reemission in supergravity; the\ntwo are found to match [10,19]. The degeneracy of RR\nground states in this theory gives a microscopic entropy\nwhich scales as \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001n1n5p ; this was found to match a suitable\ncounting in a supertube description in [20,21]. However,\nthis entropy is not large enough to correspond to a black\nhole with a macroscopic horizon. It is therefore important\nto extend the identification to states that carry a third\ncharge np, momentum along the string. These states have\na microscopic degeneracy \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001n1n5npp , and were used in [2]\nin the calculation of the black hole entropy. Recently,\nGiusto, Mathur, and Saxena have identified smooth geome-\ntries corresponding to some of these states [22,23],\nalthough the geometries constructed so far correspond to\nvery special states, the spectral flows of the RR ground\nstates studied earlier.2 The overall evidence for the picture\nof black holes advanced by these authors is, in our judge-\nment, interesting but not yet compelling.\nWe will extend these investigations to find more general\nsolitonic solutions in supergravity and to identify corre-\nsponding CFT states. We believe that whether or not the\npicture of black holes advanced by Mathur and collabora-\ntors proves to be correct, these solitonic solutions will\nremain of interest in their own right. It is particularly\ninteresting that we can find completely smooth nonsuper-\nsymmetric solitons. These are, as far as we are aware, the\nfirst explicit examples of this type.\nWe find these solutions by generalizing an analysis\npreviously carried out for special cases in [15,16,22,23].\nWe consider the nonextremal rotating three-charge black\nholes given in [31] and systematically search for values of\nthe parameters for which the solution is smooth and free of\nsingularities. We find that if we allow nonsupersymmetric\nsolutions, there are two integers m; n labelling the soliton\nsolutions. The previously studied supersymmetric solu-\ntions correspond to m \u0005 n\u0006 1. Thus, we find new non-\nsupersymmetric solitons. Further solutions, some of which\nare smooth, can be constructed by orbifolds of this basic\nfamily. This provides another integer degree of freedom k.\nSome of the supersymmetric orbifolds have not been pre-\nviously studied.\nWe identify the basic family of smooth solutions labeled\nby m; n with states in the CFT constructed by spectral flow\nfrom the NSNS vacuum, with m\u0006 n units of spectral flow\napplied on the left and m\b n units of spectral flow applied\non the right. We find a nontrivial agreement between the\nspacetime charges in these geometries and the expectations\nfrom the CFT point of view. This agreement extends to the\ngeometries constructed as orbifolds of the basic smooth\nsolutions. We have studied the wave equation on these\ngeometries, and we find that as in [23], there is a mismatch\nbetween the spacetime result, \u000btsugra \u0005 \u0011R% and the ex-\npectation from the CFT point of view \u000btCFT \u0005 \u0011R. We\nbelieve that understanding this mismatch is a particularly\ninteresting issue for further development. Finally, we dis-\ncuss the appearance of an ergoregion in the nonsupersym-\nmetric solutions. We find that the ergoregion does not lead\nto any superradiant scattering for free fields.\nThe existence of these nonsupersymmetric solitons, and\nthe fact that they can be identified with states in the dual\nCFT, might be regarded as further evidence for the pro-\nposed description of black holes. However, we would\nadvocate caution. We still find it questionable whether\nwe can really describe a black hole in this way. First of\nall, the three-charge states described so far are very special.\nThe orbifolds we consider provide examples where the\nCFT state is not the spectral flow of a RR ground state,\nbut the geometries we consider all have a U\u00031\u0004 \u0002U\u00031\u0004\ninvariance. It is unclear whether the techniques used to date\ncan be extended to obtain even the geometries correspond-\ning to spectral flows of the more general RR ground states\nof [10,18], let alone to reproduce the full e \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001n1n5npp states\nrequired to explain the black hole entropy. The much more\ndifficult dynamical questions\u2014how the appearance of a\nglobal event horizon in gravitational collapse can always\nbe avoided, for example\u2014have not yet been tackled.\nNonetheless, the study of these smooth geometries offers\na new perspective on the relation between CFT and space-\ntime, and it is interesting to see that their existence does not\ndepend on supersymmetry.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In\nthe next section, we recall the metric and matter fields for\nthe general family of solutions we consider and discuss the\nnear-horizon limit which relates asymptotically flat solu-\ntions to asymptotically AdS3 \u0002 S3 ones. In Sec. III, we\ndiscuss the constraints required to obtain a smooth soliton\nsolution. We find that there is a basic family of smooth\nsolutions labeled by the radius R of the S1, the D1 and D5\n2Three-charge states were previously studied in the supertube\ndescription [24,25] in [26,27]. Other supersymmetric three-\ncharge solutions have been found in [28\u201330], but the regular\nsolutions have not yet been identified or related to CFT states.\nJEJJALA, MADDEN, ROSS, AND TITCHENER PHYSICAL REVIEW D 71, 124030 (2005)\n124030-2\nbrane charges Q1; Q5, and two integers m; n. Further solu-\ntions can be constructed as Zk orbifolds of these basic ones;\nthey will be smooth if m and n are both relatively prime to\nk. We also discuss the asymptotically AdS3 \u0002 S3 solutions\nobtained by considering the near-horizon limit. The\nasymptotically AdS3 \u0002 S3 solutions corresponding to the\nbasic family of smooth solutions are always global AdS3 \u0002\nS3 up to some coordinate transformation. In Sec. IV, we\nverify that the solutions are indeed smooth and free of\nclosed timelike curves. In Sec. V, we identify the corre-\nsponding states in the CFT, identifying the coordinate shift\nin the global AdS3 \u0002 S3 solutions with spectral flow. In\nSec. VI, we discuss the massless scalar wave equation on\nthese solutions, and show that the nonsupersymmetric\nsolutions always have an ergoregion. Finally, in Sec. VII,\nwe discuss some directions for future research.\nII. GENERAL NONEXTREMAL SOLUTION\nWe will look for smooth solutions as special cases of the\nnonextremal rotating three-charge black holes given in [32]\n(uplifted to ten-dimensional supergravity following [33]).\nThe original two-charge supersymmetric solutions of\n[15,16] were found in this way, and the same approach\nwas applied more recently in [22,23] to find supersymmet-\nric three-charge solutions. In the present work, we aim to\nfind all the smooth solutions within this family.\nIn this section, we discuss this family of solutions in\ngeneral, writing the metric in forms that will be useful for\nfinding and discussing the smooth solutions. We will also\ndiscuss the relation between asymptotically flat and\nasymptotically AdS3 \u0002 S3 solutions.

This form of the metric is as a consequence\nconvenient for studying the \u2018\u2018near-horizon\u2019\u2019 limit, as we\nwill now see.\nIn addition to the asymptotically flat metrics written\nabove, we will be interested in solutions which are asymp-\ntotically AdS3 \u0002 S3. These asymptotically AdS3 \u0002 S3 ge-\nometries can be thought of as describing a \u2018\u2018core\u2018\u2018 region in\nour asymptotically flat soliton solutions, but they can also\nbe considered as geometries in their own right. It is rela-\ntively easy to identify the appropriate CFT duals when we\nconsider the asymptotically AdS3 \u0002 S3 geometries. To\nprepare the ground for this discussion, we should consider\nthe near-horizon limit in the general family of metrics.\nThe near-horizon limit is usually obtained by assuming\nthat Q1; Q5 \u0010 M;a21; a22 and focusing on the region r2 \u0011\nQ1; Q5. This limiting procedure is easily described if we\nconsider the metric in the form (2.12): it just amounts to\n\u2018\u2018dropping the 1\u2019\u2019 in the harmonic functionsH1; H5, that is,\nreplacing ~H1 \u0012 Q1, ~H5 \u0012 Q5, and also approximating\nM sinh!1 sinh!5 \u0012 M cosh!1 cosh!5 \u0012\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nQ1Q5\np\nin the\ncross terms in the fibration.

FINDING SOLITONIC SOLUTIONS\nIn general, these solutions will have singularities, hori-\nzons, and possibly also closed timelike curves. Let us now\nconsider the conditions for the spacetime to be free of these\nfeatures, giving a smooth solitonic solution.\nWritten in the form (2.1), the metric has coordinate\nsingularities when ~H1 \u0005 0, ~H5 \u0005 0, or g\u0003r\u0004 \u0013 \u0003r2 \u0006 a21\u0004\u0002\u0003r2 \u0006 a22\u0004 \bMr2 \u0005 0. In addition, the determinant of the\nmetric vanishes if cos2\u001c \u0005 0, sin2\u001c \u0005 0, or r2 \u0005 0, which\nwill therefore be singular loci for the inverse metric. The\nsingularities at ~H1 \u0005 0 or ~H5 \u0005 0 are real curvature sin-\ngularities, so we want to find solutions where ~H1 > 0 and\n~H5 > 0 everywhere. The vanishing of the determinant at\n\u001c \u0005 0 and \u001c \u0005 \u00112 merely signals the degeneration of the\npolar coordinates at the north and south poles of S3; these\nare known to be just coordinate singularities for arbitrary\nvalues of the parameters, so we will not consider them\nfurther.\nThe remaining coordinate singularities depend only on\nr. We can construct a smooth solution if the outermost one\nis the result of the degeneration of coordinates at a regular\norigin in some R2 factor; that is, of the smooth shrinking of\nan S1. If this origin has a large enough value of r, we will\nhave ~H1 > 0 and ~H5 > 0 there, and we will get a smooth\nsolution. The coordinate singularity at r2 \u0005 0 cannot play\nthis role, as we can shift it to an arbitrary position by\ndefining a new radial coordinate by (2 \u0005 r2 \b r20. The\ndeterminant of the metric in the new coordinate system\nwill vanish at (2 \u0005 0.\nThe interesting coordinate singularities are thus those at\nthe roots of g\u0003r\u0004, and the first requirement for a smooth\nsolution is that this function have roots.

Orbifolds and more general smooth\nthree-charge solutions\nSo far, we have insisted that the solution be smooth.\nHowever, in the context of string theory, we may also\nconsider solutions with orbifold singularities, since the\ncorresponding worldsheet conformal field theory is com-\npletely well defined. In the context of the above smooth\nsolutions, a particularly interesting class of orbifolds is the\nZk quotient by the discrete isometry \u0003y;  ;\u001e\u0004 \f \u0003y\u0006\n2\u0011R=k; ;\u001e\u0004.\nIn the two-charge case, the quotient acts as \u0003y;  ; ~\u001e\u0004 \f\n\u0003y\u0006 2\u0011R=k; ; ~\u001e\u0006 2\u0011m=k\u0004 in the coordinates appropri-\nate near r \u0005 0. This isometry has a fixed point at r \u0005 0,\n\u001c \u0005 0, so the resulting orbifold has a Zk orbifold singu-\nlarity there. In addition, if k andm are not relatively prime,\nthere will be a Zj orbifold singularity at r \u0005 0 for all \u001c,\nwhere j \u0005 gcd\u0003k;m\u0004. The supersymmetric orbifolds corre-\nsponding to m \u0005 1 have previously been studied\n[10,15,19].\nIn the three-charge case, the discrete isometry becomes\n\u0003y; ~ ; ~\u001e\u0004 \f \u0003y\u0006 2\u0011R=k; ~ \b 2\u0011n=k; ~\u001e\u0006 2\u0011m=k\u0004, and\nthe Zk will be freely acting if m and n are relatively prime\nto k. Thus, we get new smooth three-charged solutions by\norbifolding by a kwhich is relatively prime tom and n. We\ncould have found such solutions directly if we had allowed\nfor the possibility that y! y\u0006 2\u0011Rk is the closed circle at\n( \u0005 0, instead of insisting that it be y! y\u0006 2\u0011R. We also\nhave orbifolds similar to the two-charged ones if one or\nboth of m and n are not relatively prime to k.

VERIFYING REGULARITY\nIn the previous section, we claim to have found a family\nof smooth solitonic solutions, by imposing three conditions\non the parameters of the general metric. We should now\nverify that these solutions have no pathologies. In this\nsection, we will use the radial coordinate (2 \u0005 r2 \b r2\u0006\n(for the two-charge solutions, (2 \u0005 r2), which runs over\n( \r 0.\nThe first step is to check that ~H1 > 0, ~H5 > 0 for all ( \r\n0, as desired. In these coordinates,\nf \u0005 (2 \u0006 \u0003a21 \b a22\u0004sin2\u001c\u0006 \u0003a22 \b a1a2s2\u0004: (4.1)\nIn the two-charge case, where a2 \u0005 0, the last term van-\nishes, so f \r 0, and hence ~H1 > 0, ~H5 > 0 everywhere. In\nthe more general case, however, the last term is\na22 \b a1a2s2 \u0005 \ba1a2\u0003s2 \b j2\u0004< 0; (4.2)\nso we do not have f \r 0. Examining ~H1 directly,\n~H1 \u0005 (2 \u0006 \u0003a21 \b a22\u0004sin2\u001c\u0006 a1a2\u0003s2 \b j2\u0004\n\u0002 \u0003s\b2j\b2s21 \b c21\u0004; (4.3)\nso for ~H1 > 0 everywhere, we need the last factor to be\npositive. We know s2 > j2, and we can rewrite the last\nbracket as\n\u0003s\b2j\b2s21 \b c21\u0004 \u0005\nc21\nj2\n\u0003\ns2\nc25c\n2\np\ns25s\n2\np\n\b j2\n\u0004\n> 0; (4.4)\nso we indeed have ~H1 > 0. We can similarly show ~H5 > 0.\nThus, the metric in the \u0003t; (; \u001c; ~\u001e; ~ ; zi\u0004 coordinates is\nregular for all ( > 0, apart from the coordinate singular-\nities associated with the poles of the S3 at \u001c \u0005 0, \u0011=2, so\nthe local geometry is smooth.\nNext we check for global pathologies. We can easily see\nthat these solutions have no event horizons. The determi-\nnant of the metric of a surface of constant (, (3.5), is\nnegative for ( > 0. That is, there is a timelike direction\nof constant ( for all ( > 0, and hence by continuity there\nmust be a timelike curve which reaches the asymptotic\nregion from any fixed (. We will demonstrate the absence\nof closed timelike curves by proving a stronger statement,\nthat the soliton solutions are stably causal. Using the ex-\npression for the inverse metric in Appendix A, we can\nevaluate\n4In [23], other examples where n \u0001 kn0 are obtained by\napplying a chain of dualities to these ones. This is possible\nbecause while \u0003m; n\u0004 are U-duality invariant, k is not, so this\ntransformation can map us to new solutions.\nJEJJALA, MADDEN, ROSS, AND TITCHENER PHYSICAL REVIEW D 71, 124030 (2005)\n124030-8\n@2t@3tg23 \u0005 \b 1\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n~H1 ~H5\nq \nf\u0006M\u00031\u0006 s21 \u0006 s25 \u0006 s2p\u0004\n\u0006M\n2\u0003c21c25c2p \b s21s25s2p\u0004\n(2 \u0006 r2\u0006 \b r2\b\n\u000b\n< 0; (4.5)\nso @2t is a timelike covector, and t is a global time function\nfor the solitons.

The physical importance of the constant terms is\nthat they correspond to electromagnetic potentials dual to\nthe charges carried by the geometry, and their presence is\npresumably related to the first law satisfied by these soliton\nsolutions, as in [40].\nIn summary, we have shown that the two integer pa-\nrameter family of solutions identified in the previous sec-\ntion are all smooth solutions without closed timelike\ncurves. In the next section, we will explore their relation\nto the CFT description of the D1-D5-P system.\nV. RELATION TO CFT\nWe have found new smooth solutions by considering the\ngeneral family of charged rotating black hole solutions\n(2.1). These are labeled by the radius R, charges\n\u0003Q1; Q5\u0004, and three integers \u0003m; n; k\u0004. They include the\npreviously known supersymmetric solutions as special\ncases, and add nonsupersymmetric solutions and new\nsupersymmetric orbifold solutions. We would like to see\nif we can relate these solutions to the CFT description, as\nwas done for the earlier supersymmetric cases in\n[15,16,22].\nIf we consider the asymptotically AdS3 \u0002 S3 solutions\nconstructed in Sec. III D, which describe the \u2018\u2018core\u2019\u2019 region\nof the asymptotically flat solitons, we can use the powerful\nAdS\/CFT correspondence machinery to identify the corre-\nsponding states in the CFT.

Thus, we see\nthat the nonsupersymmetric states corresponding to all\nthe geometries labeled by m; n are constructed by starting\nwith the maximally supersymmetric NSNS vacuum and\napplying different amounts of spectral flow.\nIn [15], the special case m \u0005 1, n \u0005 0 was discussed. In\nthis case, the spectral flow is by one unit on both the left\nand the right, and maps the Neveu-Schwarz (NS) vacuum\nto a Ramond (R) ground state both on the left and the right.\nWe can see the supersymmetry of this state from the space-\ntime point of view: the covariantly constant Killing spinors\nin global AdS have the form\n:\u0014L \u0005 e\u0014i\u0003 ~\u001eL=2\u0004e\bi\u0003\u2019=2\u0004:0; :\u0014R \u0005 e\u0014i\u0003 ~\u001eR=2\u0004e\bi\u0003\u2019=2\u0004:0;\n(5.7)\nso when we shift ~\u001eL \u0005 \u001eL \u0006 \u2019, ~\u001eR \u0005 \u001eR \u0006 \u2019, the\nKilling spinors :\u0006L , :\u0006R become independent of \u2019, corre-\nsponding to the preserved Killing symmetries in the R\nground state. If we consider m \u0005 n\u0006 1, the spectral flow\non the right is by one unit, so :\u0006R is still independent of \u2019.\nThese are the supersymmetric states considered in [22],\nwhich are R ground states on the right, but the more general\nR states obtained by spectral flowing by 2n\u0006 1 units on\nthe left. Our nonsupersymmetric solitons correspond to the\nmore general nonsupersymmetric states obtained by spec-\ntral flowing the NSNS vacuum by m\b n units on the right\nand m\u0006 n units on the left.

This particular R ground state corre-\nsponds to the spectral flow of the NS chiral primary state\nwith \"h \u0005 \"j \u0005 c24 k\b1k . However, the charges of the state in\nthe left-moving sector are, in general, not those of a R\nground state or even the result of spectral flow on a R\nground state. For general m; n, neither sector is the spectral\nflow of a ground state. Thus, these provide examples of\ngeometries dual to more general CFT states.\nTo specify the CFT state completely, we need to say if\n(5.10) are the charges of a RR or a NSNS state. To do so, let\nus consider the spin structure on spacetime. Whenm or n is\nrelatively prime to k, there is a contractible circle in the\nspacetime, and as a result the spin structure is fixed. The\ncontractible circle is \u0003\u20190; \u001e;  \u0004 ! \u0003\u20190 \u0006 2\u0011k;\u001e\b\n2\u0011m; \b 2\u0011n\u0004. The fermions must be antiperiodic\naround this circle. For the case where neither m nor n is\nrelatively prime to k, we are not forced to make this choice,\nbut we will assume that we still choose a spin structure\nsuch that the fermions are antiperiodic around this circle;\nthis would correspond to the spin structure inherited from\nthe covering space of the orbifold.\nIn the supersymmetric case m \u0005 n\u0006 1, and more gen-\nerally for m\u0006 n odd, this implies that the fermions are\nperiodic under \u20190 ! \u20190 \u0006 2\u0011k at fixed \u001e; . For k odd,\nthis implies the fermions must be periodic under \u20190 !\n\u20190 \u0006 2\u0011, while for k even, they may be either periodic or\nantiperiodic. Thus, for m \u0005 n\u0006 1, we can always choose\nthe periodic spin structure for the fermions on spacetime.\nThis spacetime will then be identified with the supersym-\nmetric RR state with the charges (5.10). However, for k\neven, we can choose the antiperiodic spin structure for the\nfermions on spacetime; this spacetime will then be identi-\nfied with a NSNS state with the same charges (5.10). In this\nlatter case, neither the spacetime solution nor the CFT state\nis supersymmetric.\nThe situation becomes stranger for m\u0006 n even. The\nantiperiodicity around the contractible cycle implies that\nthe fermions will be antiperiodic under \u20190 ! \u20190 \u0006 2\u0011k at\nfixed \u001e; . If k is odd, this is compatible with a spin\nstructure antiperiodic in \u20190, but if k is even, there is no\nspin structure on the orbifold which satisfies this condition.\nThe orbifold cannot be made into a spin manifold. The\ngeneral conditions for such orbifolds M=$ to inherit a spin\nstructure from the spin manifold M were discussed in [46];\nsee also [47] for further discussion relevant to the case at\nhand. It will be interesting to see how this obstruction for k\neven, m\u0006 n even is reflected in the CFT dual.5We use a slightly different notation than [22].\nJEJJALA, MADDEN, ROSS, AND TITCHENER PHYSICAL REVIEW D 71, 124030 (2005)\n124030-10\nIn the other cases, we can unambiguously identify the\nCFT state corresponding to the geometry as the state with\ncharges (5.10) in the sector with the same periodicity\nconditions on the fermions as in the spacetime (choosing\none of the two possible spin structures on spacetime in the\ncase k even, m\u0006 n odd). It would be interesting to con-\nstruct an explicit description of these states, as in the\ndiscussion in [22,23].\nThus, there is a clear CFT interpretation of the asymp-\ntotically AdS3 \u0002 S3 geometries. However, the interesting\ndiscovery in this paper is that there are nonsupersymmetric\nasymptotically flat geometries, and we want to ask to what\nextent these can also be identified with individual micro-\nstates in the CFT. Clearly the appropriate CFT states to\nconsider are the ones described above, but does the iden-\ntification between state and geometry extend to the asymp-\ntotically flat spacetimes? In particular, does it make sense\nto identify the asymptotically flat spacetime with a CFT\nstate in the general case where it does not have a large\napproximately AdS3 \u0002 S3 core region, and there is no\nsupersymmetry?6 We would not in general expect the\nmatch to asymptotically flat geometries to be perfect, but\nthere is one nontrivial piece of evidence for the identifica-\ntion of the full asymptotically flat geometries with the CFT\nstates: the form of the charges still reflects the CFT struc-\nture. Plugging our parameters into (2.8), (2.10), and (2.11),\ngives\nQp \u0005 nmQ1Q5R2 ; (5.11)\nJ\u001e \u0005 \bmQ1Q5R ; (5.12)\nJ \u0005 nQ1Q5R : (5.13)\nThese reproduce the quantization of the CFT charges in\n(5.2). In the orbifold case, we replace R by kR, as the\nphysical period of the asymptotic circle is k times smaller,\nand these values now agree with the charges in (5.10). This\nseems to us like a very nontrivial consistency check, as it is\nvery difficult to even express the parameters M;a1; a2\nappearing in the metric (2.1) in terms of Q1, Q5, and R\nand the integers m; n, so there is no reason why we would\nhave expected to get such a simple result automatically. So\nthis appears a good reason to believe properties of the full\nasymptotically flat geometries are connected to the CFT\nstates. Note, however, that it does not seem to be possible\nto cast the ADM mass in such a simple form. In the next\nsection, we will see also that the predicted time delay\ninvolved in scattering of probes does not quite match\nCFT expectations.\nVI. PROPERTIES OF THE SOLITONS\nWe will briefly discuss some properties of these solu-\ntions, solitons, and their relation to the dual CFT. We first\ndiscuss the solution of the massless scalar wave equation in\nthese geometries, following the discussion in [10,19,23]\nclosely. We then consider the most significant difference\nbetween our nonsupersymmetric solitons and the super-\nsymmetric cases, the absence of an everywhere causal\nKilling vector.\nA. Wave equation\nIt is interesting to study the behavior of the massless\nwave equation on this geometry.

At the\nquantum level, one might worry that these antiperiodic boundary\nconditions lead to a constant energy density inconsistent with the\nassumed asymptotic flatness.\nNONSUPERSYMMETRIC SMOOTH GEOMETRIES AND . . .

As\nin [23], there is a \u2018\u2018redshift factor\u2019\u2019 % between our space-\ntime result and the expected answer from the CFT point of\nview. It was argued in [23] that such a factor must appear to\nmake the spacetime result invariant under permutation of\nthe three charges, and it was proposed that this factor could\nbe understood as a scaling between the asymptotic time\ncoordinate t in the asymptotically flat space and the time\ncoordinate appropriate to the CFT. Evidence for this point\nof view was found by noting that in the cases where the\nsoliton had a large AdS3 \u0002 S3 core region, the global AdS\ntime *was proportional to Dt, so \u000b* \u0005 \u0011Rs in accordance\nwith CFT expectations. In our nonsupersymmetric case, for\nfixed m; n, the appropriate limit in which we obtain a large\nAdS region is the limit !1; !5 \u0010 1 for fixed !p considered\nin Sec. III D. We did not see any such scaling between the\nAdS and asymptotic coordinates there, but % \u0012 1 in this\nlimit, so this is consistent with the interpretation proposed\nin [23]. However, we remain uncomfortable with this\ninterpretation. It is hard to argue directly for such a redshift\nbetween the CFT and asymptotic time coordinates in the\ngeneral case where the soliton does not have a large\napproximately AdS3 \u0002 S3 core. Indeed, in the dual brane\npicture of the geometry, where we have a collection of D1\nand D5 branes in a flat background, one would na\u0131\u00a8vely\nexpect the two to be the same. A deeper understanding of\nthis issue could shed interesting light on the limitations of\nthe identification between CFT states and the asymptoti-\ncally flat geometries.\nB. Ergoregion\nAlthough our soliton solutions are free of event hori-\nzons, they typically have ergoregions. These already ap-\npear in the supersymmetric three-charge soliton solutions\nstudied in [22,23], where the Killing vector @t, which\ndefines time translation in the asymptotic rest frame, be-\ncomes spacelike at f \u0005 0 if Qp \u0001 0. However, in these\nsupersymmetric cases, there is still a causal Killing vector\n(arising from the square of the covariantly constant Killing\nspinor), which corresponds asymptotically to the time\ntranslation with respect to some boosted frame. A striking\ndifference in the nonsupersymmetric solitons is the ab-\nsence of any such globally timelike or null Killing vector\nfield.7 The most general Killing vector field which is causal\nin the asymptotic region of the asymptotically flat solutions\nis\nV \u0005 @t \u0006 vy@y (6.16)\nfor jvyj \u0018 1.

Note that as a con-\nsequence, the two-charge nonsupersymmetric solutions\nalso have ergoregions.\nIn a rotating black hole solution, the existence of an\nergoregion typically implies a classical instability when the\nblack hole is coupled to massive fields [48,49]. This insta-\nbility arises when we send in a wave packet which has\npositive energy less than the rest mass with respect to the\nasymptotic Killing time but negative energy in the ergore-\ngion. The wave packet will be partially absorbed by the\nblack hole, but because the absorbed portion has negative\nenergy, the reflected portion will have a larger amplitude.\nThis then reflects off the potential at large distances and\nrepeats the process. This process causes the amplitude of\nthe initial wave packet to grow indefinitely, until its back-\nreaction on the geometry becomes significant.\nOne might have thought that in the supersymmetric\nthree-charge solitons, the instability would not appear as\na consequence of the existence of a causal Killing vector,\nby a mechanism similar to that discussed in [50] for Kerr-\nAdS black holes. However, this instability is in fact absent\nfor a different reason, which applies to both supersymmet-\nric and nonsupersymmetric solitons. The instability in\nblack holes is a result of the existence of both an ergore-\ngion and an event horizon, so in the solitons, the absence of\nan event horizon can prevent such an instability from\noccurring. Indeed, from the discussion of the massless\nwave equation in the previous section, we can see that\nthe net flux is always zero, and the amplitude of the\nreflected wave is the same as that of the incident wave.\nThat is, although there is an ergoregion, no superradiant\nscattering of classical waves occurs in this geometry, and\nthe mechanism that led to the black hole bomb does not\napply here. There might be an instability if we considered\nsome interacting theory, as the interactions might convert\npart of an incoming wave packet to negative-energy modes\nbound to the soliton, but we will not attempt to explore this\nissue in more detail.\nThus, for free fields, there is no stimulated emission at\nthe classical level. We will now show that there is also no\nspontaneous quantum emission.8 There is a natural basis of\nmodes for this geometry; for the scalar field, (6.2).

The modes of\npositive norm \u0003%;%\u0004> 0 correspond to creation operators,\nwhile those of negative norm \u0003%;%\u0004< 0 correspond to\nannihilation operators. Because of the complicated form of\nthe inverse metric (see appendix A), it is difficult to estab-\nlish explicitly which are which. However, the main point is\nthat we can define a vacuum state by requiring that it be\nannihilated by the annihilation operators corresponding to\nall the negative frequency modes in (6.2). This will then be\nthe unique vacuum state on this geometry. Since the modes\n(6.2) are eigenmodes of both the asymptotic time-\ntranslation @t and of the timelike Killing vector in the\nnear-core region,\nV0 \u0005 \u2018@t \bm@ \u0006 n@\u001e; (6.19)\nthese will be the appropriate family of creation and anni-\nhilation operators for observers in both regions. That is,\nthese observers who follow the orbits of the Killing sym-\nmetries will detect no particles in this state.\nThus, at the level of free fields, the solitons do not suffer\nfrom superradiance at either the classical or quantum level.\nVII. FUTURE DIRECTIONS\nIn this paper, we have found new nonsupersymmetric\nsoliton solutions in the D1-D5 system and identified cor-\nresponding states in the CFT. These solitons can be viewed\nas interesting supergravity backgrounds in their own right.\nThey also provide an interesting extension of the conjec-\ntured identity between CFT microstates and asymptotically\nflat spacetimes [9,10].\nThere are two corresponding classes of issues for further\ninvestigation: further study of the geometry itself and\nelucidating the relation to the dual CFT. In the first cate-\ngory, the classical stability of these solitons as solutions in\nIIB supergravity should be checked. As we discussed in\nSec. VI B, although they have ergoregions, the usual black\nhole bomb instability will be absent at least for free fields,\nas there is no net flux in a scattering off the geometry. It\nwould be interesting to study stability more generally; in\nparticular, it would be interesting to know if the geometry\nsuffers from a Gregory-Laflamme [51] type instability if\nwe make the torus in the zi directions large.\nIt would be interesting to try to find asymptotically AdS5\ngeneralizations of these solitons, building on the studies of\nblack holes in gauged supergravities in [40], as in AdS it\nmight be possible to find nonsupersymmetric solitons with\na globally timelike Killing vector. This is known to be\npossible for some Kerr black holes in AdS [50,52].\nIt would also be interesting to study these solutions as\nbackgrounds for perturbative string theory. They provide\nnew examples of smooth asymptotically flat geometries\nthat do not have a global timelike Killing symmetry, of a\nrather different character from those presented in [53].

PHYSICAL REVIEW D 71, 124030 (2005)\n124030-13\nexistence of supersymmetric special cases may be a sim-\nplifying feature.\nThe most important direction of future work to elucidate\nthe relation of these geometries to the dual CFT is to\nconstruct explicit CFT descriptions of the states dual to\nthe generic orbifold spacetimes and study their properties\nfrom the CFT point of view. The charges for the dual states\nfound in (5.10) show that these states are not simply the\nspectral flow of some chiral primary, so they do not max-\nimize the R-charge for given conformal dimension. They\nshould therefore be closer to representing the \u2018\u2018typical\u2018\u2018\nbehavior of a CFT state (although they are clearly still very\nspecial), and we expect there will be new tests of the\nrelation between geometry and CFT to be explored. It\nwill also be interesting to see what happens in the CFT\nwhen we consider the orbifolds with m\u0006 n even, k even,\nwhere the spacetime is not a spin manifold.\nAnother important basic issue from this point of view is\nto understand the appearance of stationary geometries dual\nto nonsupersymmetric states coupled to bulk modes. We\nwould have expected that the CFT states would decay by\nthe emission of bulk closed string modes. Even in the\nsimple cases where the near-core geometry is global\nAdS3 \u0002 S3, the corresponding CFT state carries compa-\nrable numbers of left- and right-moving excitations, which\nwe would expect can interact to produce bulk gravitons.\nThis physics does not seem to be represented in our dual\ngeometries. It will be important to study the decay of these\nnonsupersymmetric states in more detail and to try to\nunderstand the relation to the soliton.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Vijay Balasubramanian, Micha Berkooz, and\nJoan Simo\u00b4n for discussions.
