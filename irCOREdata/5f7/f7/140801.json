The associations between crashes and the violation and \nerror factors of the DBQ however, may be spuriously high due to reporting bias. In the \npresent study, the DBQ was tested as predictor of self-reported and recorded accidents in \nfour samples of private and professional drivers. The findings show that the DBQ scale \nonly predicts self-reported accidents, not recorded crashes, despite the higher validity of \ncompany data, and the higher means of the recorded data across these samples. The \nresults can be explained by a common method variance bias. In our review of the DBQ \nresearch, the use of the instrument was found to be heterogeneous concerning the number \nof items, scales used, and factor analytic methods applied. Thus, the DBQ may not be as \nhomogenous and as successful in predicting accidents as is often claimed. \n \nKeywords: DBQ, questionnaire, traffic accident, crash, driver, common method variance \n 3 \n \nIntroduction \nRoad traffic accidents are a major health and economical problem throughout the \nworld, and research within traffic psychology has largely centered on this problem. \nOne of the main approaches has been the use of individual differences to predict their \nlater accident involvement (for reviews, see Signori & Bowman, 1974; McGuire, \n1976; Golding, 1983; Hansen, 1988; Lester, 1991; Arthur, Barrett & Alexander, 1991; \nElander, West & French, 1993; Peck, 1993; af W\u00e5hlberg, 2003). If this could be done \nwith an acceptable degree of accuracy, it would be possible to identify drivers for \ntraining or other interventions. However, for practical use, the measurement technique \nmust be valid and easy to use on a large scale. \n The simplest way of measuring behaviour is to ask people how they \ntypically behave, effectively using individuals as their own monitoring devices. In this \nway, any behaviour, thought, attitude and experience can, in principle, be canvassed \nvery cheaply, for any time period. Other methods, which have been tried for traffic \naccident prediction, do not share these advantages. Medical examinations, for \nexample, are mainly about the current somatic state of the individual (unless \nsupplemented with self-reports or archive data). Objective driving behaviour \nmeasurements are similarly restricted to the, usually very short, period of data \ngathering. \nPossibly due to these factors, driver behaviour questionnaires have been \nvery popular for many decades within traffic research. However, few of the many \nsuggested variants have reached wider acceptance. On the contrary, many inventories \nseem to have been constructed specifically for a single study, or possibly used a few \ntimes by a research group. This would seem to be the case for the Driving Behavior \n 4 \nQuestionnaire (Arthur, Strong & Williams, 1994), the Driving Habits Questionnaire \n(Schwebel, Severson, Ball & Rizzo, in press), the Driving Behavior Rating Scale \n(Barkley, Murphy, Du Paul & Bush, 2002), the Driving History Survey (Knouse, \nBagwell, Barkley & Murphy, 2005) as well as a number of others without specific \nnames (e.g. Gumpper & Smith, 1968; McGuire, 1972; Smith & Kirkham, 1982; \nLarson & Merritt, 1991; Chou, Miyazaki & Maruyama, 1994).  \nHowever, the Manchester Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ) \n(Reason, Manstead, Stradling, Baxter & Campbell, 1990) has gained wide acceptance \n(e.g. Blockey & Hartley, 1995; Parker, Reason, Manstead & Stradling, 1995; Rimm\u00f6 \n& \u00c5berg, 1999; Westerman & Haigney, 2000; Sullman, Meadows & Pajo, 2002). So \nfar, at least fifty-four published studies have used at least parts of this instrument in \nvarious ways (list available upon request from first author). The DBQ has its origins \nin Reason\u201fs error theory (Reason, 1987; Reason, Manstead, Stradling, Baxter & \nCampbell, 1990) and measures what is called aberrant driving behaviours (errors\n1\n, \nlapses and violations). One of its basic intended uses is the prediction of (individual \ndifferences in) traffic accidents. Although a number of studies have tested this (thirty-\none of the above-mentioned fifty-four), and reported some success, there is one \nfeature about the DBQ reports that should be noted; they have almost exclusively \nused self-reported accidents as the dependent variable. The only known exception in \nthe use of recorded accidents (Caird & Kline, 2004) found no significant effects. \nThis is notable because self-reports of traffic accidents have repeatedly \nbeen shown to have dubious validity (e.g. Arthur, 1991; Szlyk, Seiple & Viana, 1995; \nMcGwin, Owsley & Ball, 1998) due to memory loss (Maycock, Lockwood & Lester, \n1991; Maycock & Lester, 1995; Chapman & Underwood, 2000) and possibly other \n                                                 \n1\n The terminology has changed somewhat; other terms used include mistakes, slips, aggressive \nviolations etc. \n 5 \nbiases, like over-reporting (af W\u00e5hlberg, 2002a) and selective under-reporting (Brown \n& Beardie, 1960). Furthermore, archival sources of accidents (state and company \nrecords) seem to have different associations, as compared to self-reported ones, with \nvarious predictors (e.g. Owsley et al, 1991; Arthur et al, 2001; af W\u00e5hlberg, 2002a). \nGiven that the DBQ uses self-reports to predict other self-reports, it is \nlikely that at least some part of the significant associations reported between one or \ntwo of the factors and accidents is due to the problem of common method variance \n(Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee & Podsakoff, 2003). Common method variance refers to \n(in part) people\u201fs tendency to want to respond consistently across related measures. In \nother words, they demonstrate a tendency to locate their responses in particular \nregions of a scale such as at one end, or the middle. When these responses are \nanalysed they tend to create a correlation that is artificially inflated. Although the \nwidespread existence of this problem has been questioned, even a critic such as \nSpector (2006) acknowledges that there are many situations where this type of \nproblem might occur. Other researchers have shown effects that can be traced to \ncommon methods of gathering data within studies (e.g. Williams, Cote & Buckley, \n1989; Moorman & Podsakoff, 1992). \nWith regards to traffic psychology, it could be that people report in a \nself-congruent manner about their accidents and behaviours, when the latter are \nperceived as relevant for traffic safety. This mechanism is a slight extension of the \n\u201econsistency motif\u201f suggested for cognitions and attitudes (Osgood & Tannenbaum, \n1955), in which respondents search for similarities between items and respond in \nways that are more consistent than is actually the case in real life. For traffic \nbehaviour and its link with accidents, it could be that there is an artifactual \nconsistency in reporting between the number of accidents respondents have been \n 6 \ninvolved in and the behaviours they believe may have had an impact on their accident \nrecord. If this hypothesis is applied to the DBQ, it can, for example, be predicted that \nassociations between these factors and accidents will be stronger if the accidents are \nself-reported, than if they are retrieved from actual records. \nThe present study was undertaken to test the specific hypothesis that the \nDBQ can predict self-reported accidents, but not recorded crashes. The two main \nsources for objective accident data are state records and transport company data. \nThere are two methodological problems that emanate from this hypothesis. First, state \nrecords typically have lower means (and variability) than self-reported accident data \nfor the same drivers over short time periods (Schuster & Guilford, 1962; McGuire, \n1973; Sobel & Underhill, 1976), and any comparison of predictive power between \nthese sources is therefore automatically confounded by this difference. However, for \nthe present study, it was possible to use self-reported and transportation company \ndata. Although the evidence regarding the validity of such data is sparse, it has been \nshown for one of the companies used here that the records contain more accidents \nthan the drivers themselves reported for a three-year period (af W\u00e5hlberg, 2002a). \nThe second problem to consider is that the DBQ was not developed for \nbus drivers or other professional driver groups, and it could be argued that the DBQ is \nnot applicable for such samples. However, it is possible to adapt the DBQ for bus \ndriving, deleting items that are not suitable (car specific), and replacing them with \nsimilar ones that are pertinent to bus driving. If the general principle of aberrant \ndriving behaviour predicting accident involvement is robust, then the DBQ should \nwithstand minor alterations to the surface content of some items and still be able to \npredict accidents. It should also be remembered that a few studies have made these \nkinds of alterations for specific populations other than normal car drivers (e.g. older \n 7 \npeople (Parker, 1999), truck drivers (Sullman, Meadows & Pajo, 2002) and various \nother professional drivers (S\u00fcmer, 2003)), yet managed to predict their self-reported \naccident involvement. \nTurning to accidents as a dependent variable, this is an area fraught with \ndifficulties, both statistical and methodological. The basic problem is the \nuncommonness of traffic incidents of such severity as to be called accidents, which \ncreates a skewed distribution in most populations for the time periods used for \ncalculations. This means that statistical power will be low, and the range of suitable \nmethods somewhat restricted. At the same time, it should be remembered that many \ndifferent statistical analyses have been used by various researchers, and there is some \nvirtue in using certain tests even when they have sub-optimal power, given the \nimportance of being able to compare results. \nOne methodological problem of some importance in the present study \nconcerns what kind of accidents should be used as the dependent variable. Most \nresearchers take all accident data recorded, without further consideration (af \nW\u00e5hlberg, 2003), while some deliberate over culpability, responsibility, active-\npassive and similar concepts. The differences between the first two terms (and several \nother, such as \u201eavoidable\u201f) would seem to be slight, although it is most often hard to \nknow exactly what is meant by any of these terms, as they have seldom been defined \n(af W\u00e5hlberg, 2003). They all concern whether a driver has been partly responsible \nfor the cause of an accident, and mainly seem to differ in their degree of severity of \ntheir criterion; the percentage of collisions that are ascribed as at least partly a driver\u201fs \nfault differ rather strongly between studies (from 35 percent (Brandaleone & Flamm, \n1955) to 85 percent (Drummer et al, 2004)). The active-passive notion (West, 1997), \nhowever, is different from the various culpability terms, and mainly concerns which \n 8 \nparty was moving faster before the collision. Exactly what active-passive means is \nhard to determine (af W\u00e5hlberg, 2002b), but there is probably a good degree of \noverlap with between this term and culpability. The problem is whether there is such a \nthing as an accident involvement that is unrelated to the driver's behaviour. This is a \ndaunting issue that has so far not been resolved.  It is not the purpose of this study, \nhowever, to resolve this issue, merely to bring it to the reader\u201fs attention. \nThe originators of the DBQ did not state explicitly which factors may \nrelate to the concept of culpability, but the notion of active\/passive accidents has at \ntimes been used in DBQ studies (e.g. Parker, McDonald, Rabbitt & Sutcliffe, 2000; \nFergusson, Horwood & Boden, in press). As the whole concept of aberrant driving \nwould seem to imply that the drivers with these behaviours cause accidents, it would \nbe reasonable to assume that only culpable accidents should be included as the \ndependent variable. Yet most DBQ studies have not considered, or even discussed the \nissue. For the present study then, different variants of the dependent variable were \nused to address this methodological problem. \nSumming up, the present study compared the predictive power of the \nDBQ using traffic accidents from different sources as dependent variables, with the \nmain consideration being self-reported versus recorded ones. To make the results \ninterpretable and comparable across samples, several statistical methods were \nemployed, as well as different accident variables. \nMethod \nGeneral \nData from four different research projects were analyzed in this study. The first was \nundertaken in the United States, the second in the United Kingdom, the third in \nSweden, and the fourth in Canada. For the first two samples, a DBQ for car drivers \n 9 \nwas distributed, in the third, respondents completed a DBQ modified for bus driving, \nand in the fourth a DBQ for professional truck drivers was used. Each study had its \nown unique combination of sample, materials and dependent variables, but all \ncontributed a facet concerning the use of self-reported accidents and the \nadministration of the DBQ. Descriptive data for the four samples are shown in Table \n1. \nQuestionnaires \nThe DBQ exists in many different versions, where each researcher, or even study, \nseems to have used a unique combination of number and type of items (see further \ninformation in the discussion). In the present report, the original 50-item version was \nused (Reason, Manstead, Stradling, Baxter & Campbell, 1990; Blockey & Hartley, \n1995) in the U.S. and U.K. studies (see Appendices 1 and 2), but with a six-point \nLikert-type response scale instead of the original five (see further information in the \nresults section). The U.S. study DBQ also had a code for 'Not applicable'. \nThe Swedish Bus-DBQ questionnaire administered for the present study \nconsisted of thirty-two items with a six-point Likert-type response scale (see \nAppendix 1), where fourteen were newly created to be bus driver specific, and the \nothers were taken from the Swedish version of the DBQ (\u00c5berg & Rimm\u00f6, 1998; \nRimm\u00f6 & \u00c5berg, 1999). The aim was to include similar numbers of violations, errors, \nslips and lapses (see comments in Appendix 3). \nIn the Canadian sample, 15 items from the DBQ (Parker, Reason, \nManstead & Stradling, 1995) and an additional item on using cellular phones were \nused to assess general driving errors and violations (see Appendix 4). The items were \nresponded to on a five-point Likert-type scale.  \nSamples and procedures \n 10 \nThe U.S. sample consisted of older adults without diagnosis of dementia, Parkinson\u201fs \ndisease, psychosis, eye conditions other than refractive error or cataract, or any \nillness, enrolled in a prospective study on the impact of cataracts on mobility (ICOM) \nas described in (Owsley et al., 2002; Owsley, Stalvey, Wells, & Sloane, 1999; \nOwsley, Stalvey, Wells, Sloane, & McGwin, 2001). All were licensed to drive in \nAlabama and were active drivers. Drivers had been recruited through eye care clinics \nin the Birmingham, Alabama area. The questionnaire was distributed at the third \nannual follow-up visit for the ICOM study.  They were asked to complete the DBQ \nusing the reference of their behaviours over the past 10 years. \nAll U.K. drivers were employees of a major U.K. bus company. Two \nhundred and forty-eight drivers returned the questionnaire, but ten of them had to be \ndiscarded due to missing data, and the final sample consisted of 238 respondents. The \nquestionnaire contained items about name and payroll number, so all respondents \ncould be identified. \n In Sweden, the Bus-DBQ and a pre-paid envelope were distributed to \nabout 350 drivers\n2\n at the bus company Gamla Uppsalabuss (GUB) through their \npersonal mailboxes at the bus garage. Each questionnaire was marked with the \ndriver's employment number for identification purposes. A reward consisting of a free \nticket to the movies was sent to each respondent. After three weeks, a reminder was \nsent to drivers that had not responded. Finally, a few drivers were contacted in person \nand asked to complete the questionnaire. A total of 127 questionnaires were returned \nwith complete data for the analyses undertaken here (a somewhat larger number was \nused for factor analysis and some accident calculations using all available data). \n                                                 \n2\n A higher number of questionnaires were distributed to mail slots, but several of these were probably \nvacant, due to the employment numbers not having been updated on slots of drivers who had quit or \nwere on long-term sick leave. \n 11 \n In Canada, all participants were professional drivers for a single oil and \ngas distribution company. Surveys were distributed to drivers through a company \ncontact during January and February of 1998. To ensure confidentiality of the data \ncollection procedure, surveys were sent directly to the researchers. A total of 330 \nsurveys were distributed and 190 of them were returned (58% response rate). \nHowever, only 115 cases had complete data for all variables used in the present study. \nThese data were used in Caird and Kline (2004), but the present analysis was more \nextensive. \n \nTable 1 about here \n \n \nAccident data \nQuestions concerning the number of traffic accidents the driver had been involved in \nduring the last year and how many of these instances the police had been called to \nscene were included in the U.S. DBQ study, while recorded accident data was \nsupplied by the Alabama Department of Public Safety for a period of ten years (before \nand after the collection of the self-report data). The recorded accident data included \ninformation about culpability for each crash, assigned by the reporting police officer. \nIn a few cases (nine), culpability had not been recorded. These cases were treated as \nculpable accidents, as it was more probable that some blame could have been allotted, \nthan no blame given the findings of af W\u00e5hlberg and Dorn (2007). Therefore, four \ndifferent dependent variables were available for this sample, two self-reported \n(number of crashes and number of police attended crashes) and two recorded \n 12 \n(culpable and All) with the latter variables differing as to culpability, while the first \ntwo variables probably measured different degrees of crash severity. \nA major British bus company supplied recorded traffic accident data for \nthe U.K. study. This company\u201fs reporting system records incidents occurring during \nwork after each shift according to a strict vehicle check policy before handing over \nthe vehicle to the driver on the next shift. Data recorded included all damage and \ninjuries involving the bus and due to bus driver behaviour or other road users. \nCulpability for traffic accidents (including falls in the bus) was assigned by the \ndriver's manager in collaboration with an insurance team, incorporating such \ninformation as the driver's report, photographs, witness reports etc. Three levels of \nresponsibility for the accident were used; none, some and sole. Therefore, in the U.K. \nsample, drivers' accident record was represented by three culpability variables; \nnumber of All accidents, All responsible accidents, and Solely responsible accidents. \nNo self-report data were gathered for this sample. \nIn the Swedish study, bus accident data were gathered from the archives \nof GUB (af W\u00e5hlberg, 2002b; 2004). For the present study, number of accidents for \nthe three years before the questionnaire was distributed was used as the dependent \nvariable, regardless of culpability. This was for two reasons. First, DBQ studies have \npaid little attention to culpability, and instead canvass all accidents (e.g. Blockey & \nHartley, 1995; Rimm\u00f6 & \u00c5berg, 1999; Gras et al, 2006).  Possible exceptions to this \ninclude Dobson, Brown, Ball, Powers and McFadden (1999), and Parker, West, \nStradling and Manstead (1995). Second, the project that generated the data was partly \ndesigned to investigate whether there was any difference between number of self-\nreported accidents and archival data (af W\u00e5hlberg, 2002a); adding culpability could \nhave confounded this issue. Separate questions on number of bus and car accidents, \n 13 \nregardless of culpability, for the last three years were included in the questionnaire. \nTherefore, the Swedish Bus-DBQ could be tested against three accident variables (self \nreported bus crashes, company recorded bus crashes and self reported car crashes). \nIn the Canadian Study, self-report information was gathered on the 1) \nnumber of accidents, 2) number of moving violations and 3) accident free kilometers \ndriven in the past two years on the job. In addition, participants also reported the \nnumber of \u201enear misses\u201f they experienced over the past month. Not all of these \nvariables can be said to be valid measures of safety, but they are commonly used \nwithin traffic safety research. Drivers indicated whether or not the researchers could \nsee their personnel records for research purposes.  The names of these individuals \nwere faxed to the company contact person who provided the information. Of the 190 \nrespondents, 153 (80.5%) allowed access their driving records for the number of \naccidents and the number of kilometers driven accident free (total-to-date with the \ncompany). No more information about their driving records, such as the number of \naccidents or the number of kilometers driven accident free over just the past two \nyears, nor any information about the accidents (e.g., severity, culpability), could be \nobtained. Although the information about accident-free kilometers driven is an \nunusual criterion measure, the company was tracking this information in particular so \nas to encourage safe driving amongst its employees. \nStatistical methods \nDifferent researchers have used different statistical methods from which \nto derive DBQ factors; for example principal axis factor or principal components \nanalysis with direct oblimin (\u00d6zkan & Lajunen, 2005; \u00d6zkan, Lajunen & Summala, \n2006) or varimax (\u00d6zkan, Lajunen, Chliaoutakis, Parker & Summala, in press) \nrotation, direct summing of scores (Dobson, Brown, Ball, Powers & McFadden, 1999; \n 14 \nLajunen & Summala, 2003), or no report of the analysis used (Parker, West, Stradling \n& Manstead, 1995; Parker, 1999). However, principal components analysis with \nvarimax (e.g. Reason, Manstead, Stradling, Baxter & Campbell, 1990; Blockey & \nHartley, 1995; Parker, Reason, Manstead & Stradling, 1995; Rimm\u00f6 & \u00c5berg, 1999; \nSullman, Meadows & Pajo, 2002; Gras et al, 2006) or oblimin (Parker, Lajunen & \nStradling, 1998; Parker, McDonald, Rabbitt & Sutcliffe, 2000) rotation seems to be \nthe most common choice. Thus, in the present study, principal components analysis \nwas selected for data reduction, with varimax rotation if more than one relevant \ncomponent was extracted. \nGiven the somewhat small samples used, component solutions might not \nalways be dependable. Therefore, as a complementary method, it was decided to \nsimply unit-weight the items on the pre-defined factors (e.g., violation) creating a \n\u201eforced\u201f scale. It should be remembered that violations of the kind included in the \nDBQ do not really need to form a reliable scale (i.e., a person is high or low on most \nitems) to be able to predict accident involvement. A person who only engages in \nspeeding violations is still a dangerous driver and could accumulate accidents by this \nbehaviour alone. Therefore, summing the violation items was deemed a valid method \nunder the present circumstances. This approach has also been used by other authors \n(e.g. Lajunen & Summala, 2003; Schwebel, Severson, Ball & Rizzo, in press; King & \nParker, in press). \nMeasures of association (Pearson correlation and Spearman\u201fs rho) were \nused in this study. Use of the Pearson correlation with accident data as one of the \nvariables has been questioned, due to the restriction of range on this variable. This \nargument is particularly problematic if accident data are collected over short time \nperiods and with and low-accident risk populations. In most of the present samples \n 15 \nrange restriction was not problematic for the recorded data as is evinced by the high \nmean values (see Tables 2, 4-6). The main reason for using correlational analyses is \nthat it allows comparison across studies. To supplement the measures of association, \nhowever, t-tests were used for analyses of differences between accident-involved and \naccident-free drivers.  \n \nResults \nThe U.S. study \nWhen analysing the U.S. DBQ data, two items concerning gear shifting were deleted \ndue to very low response rates, as most U.S. cars have automatic gearboxes. All item \nresponses were strongly skewed, with very low means.  This was probably due to the \nhomogeneous sample of elderly drivers. The remaining U.S. data of forty-eight items \nwas analysed using a principal components analysis (various rotated versions yielded \nvery similar results to the unrotated solution). There were fifteen components with \neigenvalues above 1, but the screeplot indicated that a solution of only one component \nwas most appropriate.  \n The fourteen items (all were errors) that loaded above .50 on this first \nfactor were included in a second principal components analysis resulting in a single \ncomponent with an eigenvalue of 4.8 explaining 34.5 percent of the variance.  Twelve \nof the 14 items loaded at .50 or higher. These items then were summed and used as an \n\u201cerror\u201d predictor. In addition, a violation scale was created by summing across the \nseventeen violation items.  These variables were then correlated with crashes, with the \nresults presented in Table 2. It can be seen that the self-reported variables had \nstronger effects for the DBQ error variable, while the situation was reversed for the \nDBQ violation scale. \n 16 \nThe associations between the criterion variables were then investigated. \nAs there were two variants of each of these two data sources, a total of six \ncorrelations could be computed. Spearman\u201fs rho was selected for these tests, due to \nthe low means for these variables. These associations are shown in Table 3. It can be \nseen that within each source the correlations were positive and strong. Between \nsources, however, all associations were negative. \n \nTables 2-3 about here \n \nThe U.K. study \nThe fifty items of the U.K. DBQ were analysed using principal components with a \nvarimax rotation\n3\n. Although there were fifteen factors with an eigenvalue above 1, the \nscreeplot indicated that a three-factor solution was acceptable in this data set.  \nThe factor-based scores for these three components were created and a violation scale \nbased on the 16 violation items was generated.  These were correlated using the \nPearson product-moment coefficient with all U.K. accident variables.  These results \nare shown in Table 4. T-tests of the differences in means on the DBQ factors and \nscale were conducted with accidents\/no accidents as the grouping variable, and are \nalso shown in Table 4. As can be seen, no significant results were found. We re-ran \nthe principal components analysis resulting in a three-factor solution, and left the \ncomponents unrotated. Component-based scales created from this analysis showed \nweak associated with accidents.  \nIt might be argued that this DBQ version (an early model) was not \noptimal for accident prediction. However, exactly what version\/which items should be \n                                                 \n3\n In an unrotated solution, forty-three items loaded most strongly on the first factor. \n 17 \nused cannot be ascertained, as there are so many of them (see further information \npresented in the Discussion). Therefore, to provide the most liberal test of the DBQ in \npredicting accidents, we conducted yet another components analysis. Starting with the \nprevious components analyses results, all items with a loading below .50 were \ndeleted, leaving twenty-five items. A principal components analysis with varimax raw \nrotation yielded five components with eigenvalues above 1, but, again, the screeplot \nindicated a three-component solution to be most appropriate. The first component had \nnine slips, three mistakes and two violations (31.4 percent explained variance, alpha \n.88), the second seven violations and one slip (9.6%), and the third two violations and \na slip (7.3%). Only one item loaded below .50. The correlations between these \ncomponent-based and the original ones were >.89 for each, and the associations for \nthe new ones with accidents very similar to those presented in Table 4, (i.e. weak and \nnot significant). Thus, regardless of how these items were pulled together, they were \nnot able to predict accidents in this sample. \n \nTable 4 about here \n \nThe Swedish study \nThe thirty-two items of the Bus-DBQ were analysed (N=146), using principal \ncomponents with varimax rotation. The screeplot indicated that a two-component \nsolution was most appropriate, where the first explained 33.4 percent of the variance, \nand the second accounted for 8.1 percent of the variance. The component loadings are \nshown in Appendix 3. The results suggest that the first component was a general \n\u201cerror\u201d component, while the second consisted mainly of violations. Component-\nbased scales constructed using these results were uncorrelated. The alphas were \n 18 \nsomewhat higher than most in DBQ research (e.g. Sullman, Meadows & Pajo, 2002). \nThe two component-based scores and a violation scale created by summing across all \nviolation items were correlated with the three available accident variables and the \nresults are presented in Table 5. \n \nTable 5 about here \n \nThe Canadian study \nThe fifteen items of the DBQ and the additional cellular telephone use item were \nanalysed, using principal components with varimax rotation. Although six \ncomponents had eigenvalues greater than 1, the first accounted for most of the \nvariance (19%) and the screeplot indicated that a one-component solution was most \nappropriate. Of the 16 items, eight had loadings above 0.40 on this component (see \nAppendix 4). Thus, a component-based DBQ scale was created using the eight items \nthat loaded on the first component (alpha = .63). This scale was a mix of items that \nwere mistakes, slips and violations. In addition, a violation scale was created by \nsumming across all six items of this type. The associations between the accident \nvariables and the DBQ variables are shown in Table 6. \n \nTables 6 about here \n \nDiscussion \n The findings across this four-part study can be summarised as thus: if a \nsignificant association between any DBQ factor or scale and accidents was found, it \nwas with a self-reported variable, not objectively recorded data, despite the higher \n 19 \nmeans and validities of the latter in all samples. It must be pointed out that there were \nvalues for the recorded accident variables that approached significance at times, and \nin a few instances, the effects were slightly stronger for the recorded variables than \nfor the self-report data. However, this is to be expected, as recorded data had higher \nmeans than self-reported data.  \n These findings lead to the need to take a closer look at the DBQ, this \nvery popular questionnaire with its often-claimed success as a psychometric \ninstrument and accident predictor. Given the statements of various researchers in this \narea (e.g. \"...small differences in factor structures have been reported.\" (Lajunen, \nParker & Summala, 2004, p. 232)), it could be expected that the DBQ should be \nhomogenous in its content and results. However, the studies using the DBQ actually \nshow a bewildering array of different combinations of items, factors, statistical \nmethods and results.  \n Starting with items, these differ both in terms of quantity and content. \nFor example, the number included by \u00d6zkan, Lajunen, Chliaoutakis, Parker and \nSummala (in press) was 19, Lajunen and Summala (2003) included 27, S\u00fcmer (2003) \nused 28, Rimm\u00f6 and \u00c5berg (1999) had 32, \u00c5berg and Rimm\u00f6 (1998) 104, while \nKontogiannis, Kossiavelou and Marmaras (2002) included 112 items. Similarly, the \nnumber of factors and their labels differ wildly between studies. The original three \nfactors of violations, errors and lapses (Reason, Manstead, Stradling, Baxter & \nCampbell, 1990) have been split further into, for example, highway code violations \nand aggressive violations (Parker, Lajunen & Stradling, 1998 mistakes, inattention \nand inexperience (\u00c5berg & Rimm\u00f6, 1998), while Blockey and Hartley (1995) found \ntwo error factors; general and dangerous. Parker, McDonald, Rabbitt and Sutcliffe \n(2000) reported five factors, and Kontogiannis, Kossiavelou and Marmaras (2002) \n 20 \nseven. See further the discussion about this in \u00d6zkan et al (in press). \n It is also interesting to note that researchers have used many different \nways of factoring the DBQ, but none of them have clearly stated why a certain type of \nanalysis was used. As the various methods differ somewhat in their results on a given \nset of data, these unexplained differences are troublesome, as it is possible that results \nwould not have been the same if a single type of analysis had been used. Still, it is \noften claimed that the DBQ factor structure has been replicated many times (e.g. \nRimm\u00f6 & \u00c5berg, 1999; Parker, Lajunen & Stradling, 1998; Gras et al, 2006). Part of \nthis replication phenomenon may be due to the use of methods suited to the occasion. \n Another result which is often stated by DBQ researchers is that \n\"...mainly violations not errors or lapses Summala, 2004, p. 231; see also Sullman, \nMeadows & Pajo, 2002 for the same type of statement). However, counting the \nnumber of studies with different results indicate that errors and lapses, taken together, \nhave been significant predictors of accidents about as many times as the various \nviolation factors (Parker, Reason, Manstead & Stradling, 1995; Parker, West, \nStradling & Manstead, 1995; Lawton, Parker, Stradling & Manstead, 1997; Meadows, \nStradling & Lawson, 1998; Dobson, Brown, Ball, Powers & McFadden, 1999 Rimm\u00f6 \n& \u00c5berg, 1999; Parker, McDonald, Rabbitt & Sutcliffe, 2000; Kontogiannis, \nKossiavelou & Marmaras, 2002; Mesken, Lajunen & Summala, 2002; S\u00fcmer, 2003; \n\u00d6zkan & Lajunen, 2005; Gras et al, 2006; \u00d6zkan et al, in press; Bener, \u00d6zkan & \nLajunen, in press). Only Blockey and Hartley (1995) did not find an effect for any of \nthe factors. On the other hand, about one third of all DBQ studies have not reported \non accident associations.  \n It is apparent that the DBQ literature is characterized by much less \ncoherence than is usually implied by the researchers active in this field, including the \n 21 \npower to predict accidents. Specific concerns with the DBQ include questions such as, \n\u201cWhat is the impact of items about hitting things while driving?\u201d (e.g. Chapman, \nRoberts & Underwood, 2000, see also items 12 and 31 in Appendix 2, and item 12 in \nAppendix 4). Including an item in the independent variable that seems to measure \npartly the same thing as the dependent variable would load the investigation in favour \nof finding an association. \n One limitation of the present study was the small n in the samples used. \nHowever, it should also be remembered that the mean number of accidents and the \nvariation in professional driver populations used were much higher than those usually \nused for DBQ studies, and any effect should therefore be easier to find. \n It could also be claimed that the UK study was flawed, because it used a \nDBQ version for car drivers on a population which it was not intended for, and the \ndependent variable was bus accidents. However, Sullman, Meadows and Pajo (2002) \ndid find a significant association between truck drivers' self-reported accidents and the \nviolation factor of a DBQ-version which was not specifically adapted to truck driving. \nAlso, this possible problem could not explain the findings in the Swedish sample of \nthe present study, where self-reported bus driving behaviours were predictive of both \nself-reported bus and car accidents. \n Based on the results of the analyses reported here, it may be concluded \nthat the items of the DBQ can weakly predict self-reported accidents, but not \ncompany \u2013 or state-recorded (i.e. objective) data. These results are in line with the \nsuggested hypothesis of a common method variance effect, specifically the \nconsistency motif. This explanation also applies to other driver behaviour \nquestionnaires, where self-reported attitudes, behaviour, personality, etc. are \ncorrelated with self-reported accidents, and could explain why the DBQ has yielded \n 22 \ndifferent accident predictors in different studies. Further, the present findings suggest \nthat using self-reported data describing behaviours, attitudes, personality, etc. is rather \noverstated as a means of understanding the link between behaviour and actual \naccident involvement. \n In general, the main arguments of those who use self-reported crash data \nare that state sources are even worse concerning their validity as a reflection of the \ntotal number, and that significant findings using self-reported accidents are proof that \nthe real associations must be even stronger, as the dependent variable contains some \nerror. The problem is that none of the DBQ studies referenced herein has tested this \nassumption, and that the present study would seem to indicate that it may be \nerroneous. It can also be questioned whether sheer number of accidents is a good \nindicator of validity, in terms of what is actually important to predict. Given that state \nrecords tend to contain the most serious accidents, and those are the ones that are most \nimportant to prevent, a method that is not able to predict this kind of traffic accident \ninvolvement is of little use. \n The main method employed for testing whether self-reports of crashes \nlead to inflated results is to do what has been done here: testing to see if other sources \nof the dependent variable yield different results. Unfortunately, few researchers seem \nto have used such precaution, with Arthur et al (2001) and Arthur, Bell, Edwards, \nDay, Tubre and Tubre (2005) being two of the exceptions. Also, it could be useful to \ntry to ascertain whether self-reported accidents are actually the same as the ones \nfound within company\/state databases. This too, is very uncommon in the literature, \nand so far the evidence points to substantial discrepancies between these sources \n(McGuire, 1973; Smith, 1976; af W\u00e5hlberg, 2002a). This leads to an important \nquestion: If the accidents that people report are often not the ones that are found in the \n 23 \ncompany records, then what accidents are they reporting about? No research \nconcerning this question has been located. \n Finally, it is clear from the present study that the DBQ (and other driver \nbehaviour questionnaires) should be used with caution by both researchers and \npractitioners. Despite its popularity, the evidence for its accident predictive power \nappears to be slight. It is a common rule of social interaction and logic that those who \nmake a claim are those who carry the weight of providing proof in favour of it. \nWithin science, it is equally common, it would seem, that it is those who dispute a \nclaim who need to do the research to show the error. The challenge now is for those \nwho rely on self-reported accident data to provide evidence that validates this measure \nagainst objective records. By extension, the validity of self-reports of other data \ncrucial to traffic safety research, such as self-reported exposure measures, may also \ndeserve scrutiny. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe data used in this paper had been generously made available by a major UK bus company and \nGamla Uppsalabuss in Sweden, and by Cynthia Owsley and Gerald McGwin (University of Alabama) \nin the US. \n \nAuthor notes: \nAnders af W\u00e5hlberg graduated with a B.

Cut the bends and occasionally drive in your right lane when Violation  0.34 \n 39 \ndriving in rural areas even though your sight is short \n \nComments on some of the bus-specific items: \n \nC5: This item was only slightly changed, from pulling out and changing lanes in general, to the more \nspecific situation of the bus stop. \nD8: When driving a long vehicle, like a bus, it is very important not to start turning before the rear \nwheels have passed all obstacles on the side that you are turning to, like the corner of the curb, or you \nwill hit it. \nD5: This is not allowed, but very common. \nD11: In Sweden, the brakes on buses are automatically on when any door is open. The back doors are \nnormally on automatic and will close when someone has passed through. However, if, for example, \nsomeone is unloading something, like a baby carrier, the driver will open the doors manually. After \ndoing this, the driver will often have to attend to other passengers entering through the front door, and \nforget that the back door is on manual and therefore still open when he has closed the front door and \ntries to move off. \nD14: A slight alteration of the original \"On turning right, nearly hit a cyclist who come up on your \ninside\". Also, this item is particularly pertinent in Uppsala, a university town with many cyclists. \nD22: The daily communication consists of messages that the drivers are supposed to read before they \nstart their day. These messages often concern temporary changes in the routes. \n 40 \nAppendix 4: The Canadian sample DBQ (items and factor loadings) \nComponent loadings from principal components analysis with varimax rotation. \nItem  Loading \n1.
