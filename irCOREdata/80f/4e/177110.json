This \nmay result in readmission to ICU or death on another ward or during the ICU \nreadmission. Early identification of patients at the highest risk would allow resources \nto be targeted appropriately and prevent avoidable morbidity and mortality.  ICU \nreadmission rates have been advocated as a marker of ICU quality on the basis that \nearly readmissions (within 48hrs) may indicate premature discharge or discharge to an \ninappropriate clinical area.1 2 Although using readmission rates as a quality indicator \nremains controversial 3 early readmissions are certainly a group who merit special \nattention. They have disproportionately high hospital mortality 4-7 and include patients \nin whom deterioration could probably have been avoided. Some may have been \ndischarged prematurely from ICU due to either clinical resource limitations or poor \ndischarge planning.5 6 Similarly some deaths after ICU may be preventable.8 \nInterventions aimed at reducing readmission or death after ICU requires timely \nidentification of patients at highest risk. At present there is no validated scoring \nsystem to predict readmission or death after ICU discharge.  \nWe aimed to determine whether we could utilise prospectively collected \nclinical data to identify which patients are at high risk of readmission or death after \nICU discharge. Identification of these patients before they leave the ICU might allow \nthese patients to be kept in ICU for a further period, to triage the patient to an \nappropriate level of ongoing care or to focus efforts in identifying early signs of \ndeterioration.9 \n 5\nPatients and Methods \nLocal research ethics committee approval was not required as the study was a \nsecondary analysis of routinely collected and anonymised clinical audit data. We \nanalysed the existing Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group database of all \nadmissions to a single mixed medical-surgical ICU over a ten year period from Jan \n1995 \u2013 Jan 2005. The ICU in Aberdeen operates as a closed unit led by consultants in \nintensive care medicine. There are no strict protocols governing admission and \ndischarge policies. Patients from all adult medical and surgical specialties are \naccommodated with the exception of cardiac surgery patients who are cared for in a \nseparate unit. A small number of postoperative cardiac patients requiring a prolonged \nstay for non-cardiac complications are transferred from the cardiac intensive care unit. \nData are collected prospectively using Ward Watcher\u2122 software (Critical Care Audit \nLtd, Yorkshire, UK). Data recorded include patient age, sex, hospital and ICU \nadmission diagnosis, severity of illness scoring (APACHE II and Simplified Acute \nPhysiology Score (SAPS II)), date and time of unit and hospital admission and \ndischarge and patient outcome up to hospital discharge. The study cohort comprises \nadult (>16 years) patients admitted during this period. These patients were considered \nas a derivation cohort to attempt to identify factors associated with death and \nreadmission to the intensive care unit.  In order to study the number of patients \nreadmitted rather than the number of readmissions, only the first ICU admission \nduring the same hospital admission was analysed. Patients who died during their first \nICU admission were excluded from analysis because they are not at risk of \nreadmission or death after ICU. Patients who were recorded as discharged for \npalliative care or expected to die (as assessed by their consultant in intensive care \nmedicine) were also excluded from the main analysis (Figure 1). These patients and \nthose who died in ICU are included only in the presentation of baseline data.  \n 6\nThree different outcome groups were examined: patients who died after ICU \ndischarge; patients who were readmitted within 48 hours of ICU discharge (early \nreadmissions); patients who were readmitted at any time during the same hospital \nadmission.  Patients falling into more than one of these poor outcome groups are \nincluded in each category since their outcome could not be identified prospectively. \nData relating to each outcome category should therefore be interpreted independently. \nAPACHE II 10 and SAPS II scores 11 were calculated using standard methods during \nthe first 24 hours of the first ICU admission. SAPS II has been found to have the best \noverall performance and APACHE II to have the best calibration when various \nseverity of illness scoring systems were tested in a large Scottish ICU database to \npredict hospital mortality.12 Daily Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS) \nscores 13 were recorded over each 24 hour period during ICU admission.  \n \nData analysis \nData are presented as median (interquartile range) or as the number of cases and the \nproportion as appropriate. The association of individual factors was assessed \nseparately in a simple logistic regression model for each of the outcomes in turn. We \nthen used a multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the relationship between \npotential variables and outcome.  \nGender and age were included in the multivariable analyses. Other predictor \nvariables were included in multivariable logistic regression model if they were \nassociated with ICU readmission or death with a p-value \u2264 0.2 in the simple logistic \nregression analysis. An a priori decision was made that variables with more than 5% \nmissing data or with obvious co-linearity were not entered into multivariable logistic \nregression model. SPSS version 14 was used for analysis. A base case analysis which \nincluded only the APACHE II score was also performed for each outcome. \n 7\nCalibration and discrimination of the prediction model were assessed using Hosmer \nand Lemeshow goodness of fit test and the area under the curve (AUC) respectively. \nNagelkerke R2 statistic was also calculated. \n \n \n 8\nResults \nOver a ten year period there were 6208 adult (\u2265 16years) admissions, of which 5725 \nwere index admissions (first admission in a single episode of hospital admission). One \nthousand one hundred and ninety patients died during their first ICU admission. One \nhundred and fifty nine were recorded as discharged for palliative care or were \nexpected not to survive. Four thousand three hundred and seventy six adult patients \nwere thus discharged alive from ICU without being recorded as expected to die or for \npalliative care (Figure 1). Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. An outline of \npatient characteristics is presented in two year time slots to allow an assessment of \npotential changes over the ten year study period (Table 2). Both case mix and ICU \nmanagement have evolved over the ten year period, but no specific changes in policy \nhave been implemented.  \nPatient Outcomes  \nFour hundred and seventy five patients (11.2%) of the study cohort died after ICU \ndischarge. Hospital length of stay in those who died after initial discharge from ICU \nwas similar to those who survived to hospital discharge (14 (5-27) vs. 13 (7-27) days). \nThree hundred and eighty five patients (8.8%) were readmitted to ICU during the \nsame hospital admission. Hospital mortality in those who were readmitted at any time \nwas 40.2% and hospital length of stay after initial discharge from ICU was 32 (18-51) \ndays. \nThe subgroup of readmissions who were readmitted within 48hours was also \nexamined. One hundred and forty three patients (3.3%) were readmitted within 48 \nhours of ICU discharge. Hospital mortality in these early readmissions was 27.7% and \nhospital length of stay after initial discharge from ICU was 31 (15-47) days.  \nHospital mortality in those who were not readmitted was 8.4% and hospital length of \nstay after ICU discharge was 13 (7-24) days. \n 9\nFactors associated with death, readmission, or readmission within 48hrs are shown in \ntables 3 to 5.  \nReason for readmission \nAdmitting diagnoses were grouped according to whether it was the same pathology as \noriginal admission or a new diagnosis. Diagnoses were further grouped on the basis of \norgan system involved. Admitting diagnosis for both initial and readmission were \navailable for 121\/ 143 patients (85%). Forty nine % were readmitted for the same or \nrelated diagnosis and 51% for a different diagnosis. Twenty eight % of the total was \nreadmitted with a new diagnosis of chest infection (initial admitting diagnosis not \nrespiratory infection); 2.5% with new sepsis (not chest); 2.5% after in-hospital cardiac \narrest; 3% with new acute respiratory distress or acute lung injury; 4% with fluid \noverload and 2% with cardiac failure.  Between them these diagnoses accounts for \n42% of the 49% of readmissions for new diagnoses. The remaining 7% were for \nmiscellaneous reasons.  \nMultivariable logistic regression  analysis \nAdmitting specialty was excluded from the multivariable analysis because of more \nthan 5% missing data (28% missing). This was not recorded routinely until 1998. \nSAPS II scores and total TISS scores were excluded because of expected co-linearity \nwith APACHE II scores and ICU length of stay respectively.  Factors associated with \ndeath or ICU readmission on multivariable analysis are shown in tables 6 to 8.  \nDiscrimination ability was moderate for the three models: AUC of 0.74, 0.67 \nand 0.62 for predicting death after ICU discharge, early readmissions and \nreadmissions respectively. Based upon the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit \ntest, there was no evidence of poor calibration for any of the three logistic regression \nmodels. However, discrimination ability based only upon the APACHE score were: \nAUC of 0.69, 0.63 and 0.59 respectively suggesting limited gain from using the full \n 10\nmodel. The highest Nagelkerke R2 statistic was 0.162 for death after ICU discharge. \nBecause of their limited usefulness, prospective validation of these models was not \nconsidered to be warranted. \n \nDiscussion \nA significant minority of patients deteriorate after discharge from intensive care. In \nour study 8.8% of initial survivors were readmitted to ICU and 11.2% died in hospital \nafter ICU discharge. These are consistent with data from other units.6 Not all of these \ndeaths and readmissions will be preventable. A few patients discharged from ICU, \nalthough not expected to die, will have been assessed as unsuitable for readmission in \nthe event of deterioration. Despite this, some will inevitably have been readmitted and \nsubsequently died. These patients are not reliably detected by our data collection \nsystem and will contribute to the post-ICU and readmission mortality figures. \nHowever, identification of other high risk patients before they leave ICU may allow \nextra resources to be targeted towards them. This may include delayed discharge; \ndischarge to a high dependency or other \u201cstep-down\u201d unit; or more aggressive follow-\nup on the wards.  \nEarly readmissions may be particularly important. Within this group there may \nbe a number of problems which might be attributed to premature discharge from ICU \nand which could have been prevented.2 6  Undoubtedly other factors will also impinge \non the early readmission rate, including local high dependency facilities, quality of \ncare on the ward after ICU discharge and the presence of ICU follow-up services. \nWhatever the reason for their deterioration and readmission it is clear that patients \nreadmitted to ICU are at much higher risk of subsequent death than those who are not \nreadmitted.4-6 It would be useful to be able to identify those at risk of readmission \nbefore initial ICU discharge.   \n 11\nNot surprisingly our data show that death after ICU is independently \nassociated with increasing illness severity, age and time in hospital before ICU \nadmission. Time in hospital before ICU may reflect a failure to respond to treatment \non a general ward or late referral to ICU.4 It is tempting to speculate that this might be \namenable to earlier intervention, perhaps facilitated by early warning systems and \nhospital outreach teams. For readmissions overall, the risk factors are similar and also \ninclude discharge to an HDU. This last factor may reflect illness severity at discharge \nor an earlier recognition of deterioration because of higher levels of monitoring. Only \nsurgical HDU facilities exist in our hospital and it is possible that surgical patients are \ndischarged earlier in their recovery phase because a higher level of step down care is \navailable. The only factors associated with early readmissions are severity of illness at \nICU admission and discharge to an HDU.  Our findings are consistent with previous \nstudies.5-7 14 Better predictive models might be produced by including more patient \nvariables at the time of ICU discharge. Status at discharge would seem a more \nrelevant factor and is also when we might have the opportunity to intervene.  Higher \nTISS scores at discharge have been found in other studies to be associated with an \nincreased risk of readmission and death but we did not confirm this finding in our \npatients.2 15 16 While discharge TISS score was statistically associated with death in \nour study, the difference between scores in those who died and survived (29 vs. 28) is \nnot clinically useful. We do not currently collect other measures of illness severity at \nthe time of patient discharge. \nOther factors associated with death or readmission after ICU have been \nidentified but none have yet translated into a useful predictive model for individual \npatients.6 A US study in a medical ICU found the acute physiology score component \nof APACHE II at ICU discharge to be the independent risk factor most associated \nwith readmission to ICU.4 This data is not collected routinely in our unit at present. \n 12\nAnother study showed proximity of extubation to time of discharge and the need for \norgan support on the day of discharge to be independently associated with \nreadmission.2 These might indicate unresolved organ failure and premature discharge \nor substandard care after ICU discharge. Premorbid functional status and several \nseverity of illness related factors such as delirium and muscle weakness might also be \nrelevant in determining outcome. None of these are currently recorded in our clinical \naudit system.  \nIf discharges are indeed premature, would delaying discharge make any \ndifference? A model developed in the UK suggested that about a third of ICU patients \nare at increased risk of death after ICU and that delaying their discharge by 48 hours \nmight reduce their risk of death.9 Decisions on discharge from ICU are currently \nbased on clinical judgement rather than objective criteria. The effect on mortality and \nreadmission of introducing a discharge policy based around a \u201cphysiological \ndischarge score\u201d is unlikely to be straightforward but deserves further investigation. \nWe do know that night-time discharge, used as an indicator for premature discharge, \nis associated with poorer outcome.16 17 Our findings did not note any influence of \nnight-time discharge, perhaps because the absolute number of night-time discharges in \nour unit was very small. Other potentially relevant organisational factors not \nconsidered in our study include ICU bed occupancy and the level of ward care. \nIncreasing length of stay in ICU or increasing the provision of high dependency care \nhave been suggested as strategies for improvement.16 Each of these solutions has \nmajor resource implications so cost-effectiveness needs to be demonstrated by \nprospective study. Case by case analysis might be valuable in identifying avoidable \nreadmissions and deaths. This has been studied elsewhere to assess quality of care \nbefore admission to intensive care and found several cases of suboptimal care but \nrather fewer cases of preventability.18 A study of 97 early readmissions to a surgical \n 13\nICU concluded that most (63%) initial discharges were appropriate, 22% of \nreadmissions were preventable, 11% of readmissions may have been anticipated and \n5% might have been prematurely discharged.5 Other studies report that up to 40% of \nreadmissions may have been associated with premature discharge.6 Such results are \nnot easily extrapolated to different units because of differing patient and \norganisational factors, particularly between countries. One strategy for obtaining local \ninformation is the development of follow-up teams who monitor patients after ICU \ndischarge, can provide early warning of deterioration and perhaps suggest \ninterventions to prevent further deterioration.19 One study of a critical care outreach \nteam found preliminary evidence of benefit in both survival and reduced readmission \nrates, 20 although this is not a universal finding.21 Effective and aggressive follow-up \nmay actually increase readmission rate. As the mortality of patients deteriorating after \nICU discharge is so high, some clinicians may elect to readmit at an early stage to \navert further deterioration. This may be clinically appropriate but will confound the \nuse of readmission rate as a quality marker. Caution must therefore be exercised when \ninterpreting comparative data on readmission rates. \nThe above studies and our results give some insight into the problem of \nunexpected deterioration after ICU discharge. Different hospitals, particularly in \ndifferent countries have different case-mixes, different step-down arrangements and \ndifferent organisational factors such as numbers of transfers between hospitals, each \nof which might affect readmission rates. This makes comparisons and identification of \ncommon predictors more difficult.3 4 6 Nonetheless, readmission rates and unexpected \ndeaths may be a relevant quality marker, particularly at a local level.  \n 14\nConclusions \nRisk of death after ICU is independently associated with increasing illness severity at \ntime of ICU admission, age and time in hospital before ICU admission. Risk factors \nfor readmission to ICU are similar and also include discharge to an HDU. Risk factors \nfor early readmissions are severity of illness at ICU admission and discharge to an \nHDU. Prognostic models based on these risk factors had moderate discrimination \nability, but only performed slightly better than models based only upon APACHE \nscore at ICU admission. We conclude that our routinely collected data cannot be used \nto produce models that are more clinically useful in predicting death or readmission \nthan admission APACHE II scores alone. In future, the most logical area on which to \nfocus efforts to predict outcome might be on physiological variables at discharge. This \ncould be based around the same acute physiological score components included in the \nAPACHE II score, not currently collected at the time of discharge from our unit. \nFollow-up of patients after discharge provides the ideal opportunity to study reasons \nfor deterioration and to assess the likely preventability of each readmission or \nunexpected death. Only when we have answered these questions will we be able to \ntarget our resources best at those at highest risk of poor outcome despite a good \nresponse to treatment of their initial illness.  \n \n 15\nFunding: None \n \nAcknowledgements: Data entry by Miss Jane Wordie and the medical and nursing \nstaff of the Intensive Care Unit in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. \n 16\nReferences \n1.
