Introduction \n Crop rotation is one of the oldest and most fundamental agronomical practices \n(Lawes et al., 1895), and is thought to have been critical in sustaining the industrial \nrevolution in Britain by increasing crop production (Brunt, 1999).  \n A rotation is \u201cthe sequence of crops grown in succession on a particular field\u201d \n(Wibberley, 1996).  The final choice of sequence is primarily a management decision \nbased on a desire to optimise, for example, financial, agricultural or environmental \nobjectives.  A key financial objective might be profit maximisation, an agricultural \nobjective might be yield maximisation from a particular mix of crops, and an \nenvironmental objective might be minimised pesticide use.  Optimisation of all \nobjectives simultaneously might not be possible, and usually the solution found is \nsubject to various constraints, e.g. pareto optimality (Matthews et al., 2006), and \nconstraint programming (Tarim et al., 2006).  In practice, the possible sequences in a \nparticular location may also be constrained by government regulation, agro-ecological \n 2 \/ 13 \nconditions (e.g. the climate, topography and soil type), the presence of disease, weeds \nand pests, and the crop varieties and technology available.  \nAn critical step in allocating crops in most rotations is identifying the crop \nmost favoured by the grower.  This may be the most profitable crop in a commercial \nsystem or a staple food crop in a subsistence system.  In parts of the UK, this primary \ncrop has changed from spring barley in the 1960s, through winter barley in the 1970s, \nto winter wheat since the 1980s (Wibberley, 1996).  Growers will typically aim to \ngrow as much of the preferred crop as possible, on a cyclical basis.  \nFrom the literature, it can be argued that there are four major types of \nconstraint or \u201crules\u201d determining crop rotations. \nThe first rule is a minimum return period between the same crop, or in some \ncases, the maximum period of growing the same crop.  Such constraints typically arise \nbecause of the need to break the cycle of the build-up of nematodes or other soil pests \n(Jones and Perry, 1978).  For example, between the 1930s and 1980s, British sugar \nfactories required a minimum return of four years for sugar beet to minimise the effect \nof beet cyst nematode (Globodera schachtii; Wibberley, 1996).  In 2006, Assured \nProduce (scheme of standards for safe food of good quality) recommended a \nminimum return period of at least four years, and ideally, six years between onion \ncrops in the UK (Assured Produce, 2007).  Whereas some farmers will grow a second \nwheat crop directly after a first wheat crop in the UK, it is less common to grow a \nthird wheat because of the build-up of soil fungi such as take-all (Gaeumannomyces \ngraminis). \nThe second rule relates to the benefits or risks of succession associated with \none crop being grown immediately after another.  The benefits could arise from \nincreased nitrogen supply, soil organic matter or water availability, improvements in \nsoil structure, and decreased pests, diseases or weed competition (Berzsenyi et al., \n2000).  For example, in the Netherlands, a leguminous crop was more likely to \nprecede organic winter wheat than in conventional arable systems (Tamis and van den \nBrink, 1999).  Conversely, risks might arise from increased weed problems.  For \nexample, in the UK barley is more contaminated by volunteer cereal weeds than \nwheat (Wray, 1993) and such volunteers can be a particular problem if cereals are \nfollowed by autumn-sown vegetable crops (Bond et al., 2006). \nThe third rule relates to within-year cycles.  The timing of sowing and harvest \nare dependent on interactions between the crop and the climate, and one crop usually \nmust be harvested before the next crop can be sown.  For example, in the UK, there is \na constraint against planting an autumn-sown cereal crop in the same year after a \nspring-sown sugar beet crop, because sugar beet harvesting usually occurs between \nOctober and January.   Obviously, inter-annual variations in climate can modify the \nconstraints operating in a given season, and therefore growers require flexibility \nwithin crop rotations to overcome such problems.  Late harvesting due to low \ntemperature or high autumn rainfall can restrict autumn cultivations to such an extent \nthat the following crops will perforce be spring- rather than autumn-sown.  Indeed, \nspring-sown oilseed rape is four times more prevalent in arable rotations in Scotland \nthan in England for this reason (Champion et al., 2003). \n The fourth rule concerns the overall proportions of the crops grown on a field \nor group of fields (Castellazzi et al., 2007).  Growers typically have only a limited \namount of dedicated machinery and labour.  They will therefore often seek to balance \nthe distribution of work through the cropping season by growing a range of crops.  In \nthis way, the grower can also spread the risk of total crop failure and economic loss \n(Lockie et al., 1995).  Alternatively, within the UK there is a recent trend to grow the \n 3 \/ 13 \nsame crop on the majority of fields in a single season, to attempt to benefit from \neconomies of scale (DEFRA, 2007).  Since 1992, another feature of crop rotations in \nthe European Union has been the obligation on growers to \u201cset-aside\u201d a particular \nproportion (5-10%) of the total area on which they had previously grown arable crops, \nin order to limit crop overproduction. \n Several authors have modelled mechanistically the development of rotations \n(Bachinger and Zander, 2006; Dogliotti et al., 2003; Maxime et al., 1996; Rounsevell \net al., 2003; St\u00f6ckle et al., 2003). Others have predicted actual rotations from large-\nscale spatial or temporal data concerning the proportions of crops grown in regions, as \nin the studies by Kl\u00f6cking et al. (2003) and Mignolet et al (2004).  Klein Haneveld \nand Stegeman (2005) referred explicitly to some of the agronomic rules discussed \nabove, through which crop rotations may be developed.  They used the mathematical \noptimisation technique of linear programming to derive rotations to assist in \nmodelling agricultural production planning.  Detlefsen (2004) presented a model \nwhich integrated elements of the optimisation and prediction approaches, by using \nnetwork modelling. The above mentioned modelling approaches seek to explain, \noptimise or even predict rotations. However none was found to provide a relevant and \nsimple mathematical framework to represent crop rotations in a stochastic and \nempirical way. Such a mathematical representation would facilitate the explicit \nintegration of crop rotations within models considering crops within agricultural \nlandscapes through time (Brown, 2000). Such models might aim at simulating soil \nerosion, diffuse pollutions, plants or animal interactions (i.e. within landscape \necology, Ben Wu and Smeins, 2000), or even coexistence scenarios of GM crops (i.e. \nmodels of gene contamination from GM to conventional varieties of a crop, \nCastellazzi et al., 2007) for which the temporal and spatial allocation of the crops in \nfields influences the simulation outputs.  \n Our objective is to present a systematic representation of crop rotations, in \nterms of well-known mathematical and rigorous statistical concepts.  We describe \nempirically determined crop rotations in a concise mathematical framework, which is \namenable to large, landscape scale modelling of agronomic practices. We show how a \nrotation may be represented mathematically as a transition matrix and how this allows \nthe estimation of the long term overall proportion of each crop grown.  We also show \nhow hierarchies of transition matrices may be used to represent the temporal evolution \nof one rotation to another, as might happen in response to crop markets or climate \nchange. \n2. Classification of crop rotations \n The classification of crop rotations is exemplified (Figure 1(b)) by a typical \narable five-year rotation for medium to heavy soils in the East Anglian region of the \nsouth-east of England (Clarke et al., 2000), described by Jim Orson (pers. comm.).  \nSimpler (Figure 1(a)) and more complex (Figure 1(c,d)) variations on this rotation are \ngiven to illustrate further examples of terminology. \nThe first type of rotation (Figure 1a) is classified as \u2018fixed\u2019.  Each crop follows \na pre-defined order with no possibility of deviation (see, for example, Colbach et al., \n2005).  Note that the two occurrences of wheat are identified differently; thus Wheat 1 \noccurs after fallow, while Wheat 2 occurs after oilseed rape (OSR).  The rotation in \nFigure 1a can also be classified as \u2018cyclical\u2019 in that it repeats itself.  The \u201creturn \nperiod\u2019 or \u2018rotation length\u2019 of the rotation is also \u201cfixed\u201d, in this case at five years.   \nThe second rotation (Figure 1b) is classified as \u2018flexible\u2019 and may be \nrepresented by a \u201cmulti-pathway\u201d network.  Here, for at least one crop within the \n 4 \/ 13 \nrotation, the grower makes a choice of which one of several crops will follow it.  For \nexample, while sugar beet would be followed optimally by late-drilled winter wheat, \non clay soils, late autumn rainfall may delay sowing to the extent that the grower is \nforced to substitute spring-sown barley.  In extreme cases of excessive winter and \nspring rainfall, the land may need to be left fallow for a year.  Hence the choice of \ncrops for this second year of the rotation is flexible.  As in the example in Figure 1a, \nthe rotation in Figure 1b is cyclical with a fixed rotation length; each of the six \npotential paths is of five years duration.   \n \n \na).

Flexible rotation, non-cyclical, variable \nFigure 1.  Examples of classified rotations  a). The rotation is \u2018fixed\u2019.  The two occurrences of \nwheat are defined differently according to when they occur, as \u2018wheat 1\u2019 or \u2018wheat 2\u2019. The \nrotation is \u2018cyclical\u2019 with a \u2018fixed rotation length\u2019 of five years.  OSR represents oilseed rape. \nb. This more typical rotation (Orson, pers. comm.) is \u2018flexible\u2019 (i.e. multi-pathways). The two \noccurrences of spring barley are labelled accordingly. It is \u2018cyclical\u2019, again with a length of \nfive years.  Ld indicates late-drilled.  c. This rotation is again flexible (i.e. multi-pathway), \nand cyclical but the rotation length is not fixed.  d. This rotation is less-structured with great \nflexibility (multi-pathway), and cyclical but with a highly variable rotation length. \n \n 5 \/ 13 \nIn the long-term for multiple pathways rotations, the pattern of succeeding \ncrops may be viewed as a series of chance outcomes, driven by unpredictable events \nsuch as climate or agricultural market forces that can be modelled by a stochastic \nprocess.  Although a grower makes deliberate decisions based on current knowledge, \nsimulation models usefully can represent future patterns stochastically, with \nprobabilities derived from previous data if available.  \n The rotation shown in Figure 1c is again flexible (i.e. multi-pathway), and \ncyclical, but in this example the rotation length is \u201cvariable\u201d.  For example, the return \nperiod to the wheat 2 crop may be either four or five years. \n The rotation in Figure 1d is less structured.  There is a great flexibility and the \nonly constraint on succession is that a crop type cannot follow itself.  The rotation \nremains cyclical but is of a highly variable rotation length.  The number of possible \npathways increases exponentially with years. \n \n3. A mathematical representation of crop rotations \n It is possible to represent most crop rotations as a set of rules in which the \nallocation of a crop in a current year is determined solely by the previous year\u2019s crop.  \nAs long as there is no need to consider any crop that was grown more than one year \nprior to the current crop, a rotation may be regarded as a Markov chain, represented \nby a stochastic matrix (Cox and Miller, 1965).  It is therefore possible to represent the \nrotation as a square transition matrix, here denoted as T.  The matrix T has as many \nrows and columns as there are distinct crops, say c.  Where a specific crop occurs \nmore than once in a rotation these occurrences must be represented by distinct rows \nand columns. The element in row i and column j, tij, represents the probability under \nthe rotation that, given that crop i was grown in the previous year, there will be a \ntransition to crop j in the current year.  Note that the sum of each row must be unity, \nso \u03a3j tij = 1, j = 1, \u2026, c. \n As an example, the rotation in Figure 1a is represented uniquely by the \ntransition matrix in Table 1a.  Note how, the two wheats are distinguished as \u2018wheat \n1\u2019 and \u2018wheat 2\u2019 (Figure 1).  Since the rotation is fixed, the only entries possible are \n\u20181\u2019, which denotes a transition must take place, or \u20180\u2019 denoting it cannot.  In Table \n1(b), the flexible rotation given in Figure 1(b) has non-zero and non-unity values in \nthe rows that represent a transition from a crop in the previous year that has more than \none possibility of a succeeding crop in the current year (i.e. has more than one branch \nin Figure 1(b)), such as sugar beet.  The values ascribed to tij for the succeeding crops \n(here, as examples, 0.3, 0.35 and 0.35 for fallow, first spring barley and late-drilled \nwheat, respectively) must sum to unity.  Of course, to represent the rotation in Figure \n1c this matrix would only require slight amendment, to replace the probability of a \ntransition from wheat 2 to sugar beet (currently t9,1 = 1) by some value, t9,1 = a, say, \nwhere 0 < a < 1, and the probability of a transition from wheat 2 to fallow beet \n(currently t9,2 = 0) by the value t9,2 = 1 \u2013 a.  Table 1c provides one example of the less-\nstructured rotation shown in Figure 1(d).  Further common temporal restrictions may \nbe represented by the transition matrix model.   \nThe restriction that successive growing of the same crop type must be \nrepresented as distinct crops (e.g. wheat 1 and 2 in the examples above) facilitates the \nforbidding of too many repetitions of the same crop.  It may be the case, for example, \nthat wheat may not be grown on the same field for more than three successive years, \nin which case the transition probability from third wheat to fourth wheat would be set \nto zero.  However, note that the modelling of a minimum return period between \nsuccessive crops of the same type, as when potatoes might be grown on the same field \n 6 \/ 13 \nonly after a gap of 8 years since the previous crop, cannot be represented through the \nsimple transition matrix model.  This is due to the limitation of the Markovian \nproperty, which considers only the previous year. Only by the imposition of further \nconditions expressed through additional transition matrices lagged by more than one \nyear could the minimum return period be represented. While this is certainly possible, \nit is beyond the scope of the discussion presented here. \nAt this stage, simulations indicate that the transition matrix method outlined \nhere are sufficiently robust not to be overly sensitive to errors in estimates, so \napproximate values should suffice. \n The transition matrix approach can be used to determine and also model the \noverall proportion of each of a grower\u2019s chosen crops, aggregated in space over fields, \nor aggregated in time over a rotation (Castellazzi et al., 2007).  If the rotation is fixed, \nthe long-term proportion of each distinct crop grown on the field is exactly equal to \n1\/c.  If the rotation is flexible then the proportion must be estimated.  Fortunately, \nexpression of a flexible rotation as a transition matrix allows the long-term average \nproportion of each crop to be estimated over the rotation, which is addressed in the \nnext section. \n \n4. Estimation of long-term proportions of crops \nThe long-term proportion of each of the crops represented in a transition matrix may \nbe estimated using well-known properties of matrices specified, for example, in \nsections 3.2 \u2013 3.4 of Cox and Miller (1965).  Suppose the distribution of crops in year \nn is denoted by the vector C(n), so that in year n the proportion of crop type j, pj, is \nrepresented by the jth element of C(n).  Following the definition of the transition \nmatrix T, we have C(2) = T * C(1), where the asterisk represents a matrix \nmultiplication operator.  More generally C(n) = T * C(n-1) = T * T * C(n-2) = Tn-1 * C(1).  \nCox & Miller (1965) discuss the conditions under which powers of the transition \nmatrix converge, and then when m is sufficiently large we have, approximately Tm = \nTm+1 = Q, say, where Q represents the converged transition matrix after self-\nmultiplication.  From this it follows that the vector C(m) also converges for large \nenough values of m since C(m) = Q * C(1).  Specifically, we find that the transition \nmatrix T(n) converges to Q as n increases, so that the c row elements in any particular \ncolumn become ever more similar.  The average of the jth column, pj = \u03a3i tij(n)\/c, then \nrepresents the long-term average proportion, pj, of the crop type represented by \ncolumn j.  In practice, care must be taken to ensure that algorithms implementing this \ntechnique do not suffer from round-off error.  For general transition matrices Cox & \nMiller (1965) explain how it may be possible to use the eigenvalues and eigenvectors \nof the matrix T to aid computation, but caution is required if the rotation has a fixed \nreturn period.  Then the matrix T(n) will converge to a stable set of c matrices rather \nthan a single matrix, where c is equal to the number of distinct crops and, therefore, to \nthe return period of the rotation.  If this is the case, then the method is identical but the \nproportions are computed by averaging the columns over c successive matrices: T(n) \nto T(n+c). \n As an example, consider the method applied to rotation (b) in Figure 1b and \nrepresented by the stochastic transition matrix in Table 1b.  The stable set of nine \nconverged matrices gave the following long-term average proportions, pj.  For sugar \nbeet (j=1): p1 = 0.2, fallow: p2 = 0.06, spring barley 1: p3 = 0.07, late-drilled wheat: \np4 = 0.07, wheat 1: p5 = 0.13, spring barley 2: p6 = 0.07, beans: p7 = 0.1, oilseed rape: \np8 = 0.1, wheat 2: p9 = 0.2.  Note that in this fairly simple example sugar beet always \n 7 \/ 13 \noccurs in the first year of the rotation and, since the rotation length is five years, it \noccurs once every five years, i.e. with a proportion of 0.2.  Furthermore, the \nproportion of the crops featuring in the following years are in direct proportion to \ntheir probability of succeeding sugar beet, i.e. to the probability of travelling down \ntheir particular branch in the network of Figure 1b.  In this way the results obtained \nmay be seen to be intuitive.  However, note also that it may be desirable to know the \nproportions of crops per se, with no distinction of their order in the rotation.  In this \ncase, wheat has an overall proportion of  p4 +  p5 + p9  = 0.07 + 0.13 + 0.20 = 0.40, \nand spring barley an overall proportion of  p3 + p6 =  0.07 + 0.07 = 0.14.  A further \nexample is given by the unstructured rotation (d) shown in Figure 1d and represented \nby the stochastic transition matrix in Table 1c.  The result is a rapid convergence to a \nsingle matrix with, in this example, the long-term average proportions for wheat \nas p1 = 0.243; fallow, p2 = 0.210; oilseed rape, p3 = 0.257; and beans, p4 = 0.290. \nTable 1. Examples of transition matrices \na) A transition matrix, T, can uniquely represent the rotation in Figure 1a; for any fixed \nrotation such as this the matrix is populated with entries that are either zero or unity.  \n  Current year \n  Sugar beet Fallow Wheat 1 OSR Wheat 2 \nSugar beet 0 1 0 0 0 \nFallow 0 0 1 0 0 \nWheat 1 0 0 0 1 0 \nOilseed rape (OSR) 0 0 0 0 1 \nPrevious  \nyear \nWheat 2 1 0 0 0 0 \nb).

For example, suppose a grower has 10 \nequally-sized fields under rotation (b), in some of which it is proposed to switch to \nrotation (d).  Furthermore, assume that the grower should achieve an average \nproportion of oilseed rape of at least 0.2.  Clearly, since p8 = 0.1 for rotation (b), the \n 8 \/ 13 \nexpected proportion of oilseed rape if f fields are put under rotation (d) varies from the \ncurrent value (with f=0) of 0.1 to a value of 0.257 (with f = 10, from the value of \np3 for rotation (d)).  So, in general, the expected proportion of oilseed rape is: \n[0.1(10-f) + 0.257f]\/10.  Then it can be seen that the grower must put at least f = 7 \nfields into rotation (d) to achieve the desired minimum proportion.  Note, however, \nthat an increase in one crop proportion always will come at the cost of a decrease in \nanother, as is the case here for wheat, which for f = 7 would decline in proportion \nfrom 0.40 to about 0.29.  To optimise over several crop proportions at once requires \nfurther information concerning costs and benefits and is a complex linear \nprogramming problem which may be solvable, but is outside the scope of this paper. \n \n5. Transitions between rotations \n In this section a further extension to the representation of rotations as \ntransition matrices is introduced.  This facilitates the modelling of a process where a \ngrower might wish to change between several rotations, for example to maximise \nprofit or to minimise pest and disease pressure.  The ideas are best illustrated with a \nsimple example concerning two fixed rotations (Figure 2).  The first rotation, R1, is of \nlength three years, with wheat followed by oilseed rape followed by beans.  The \nsecond, R2, is of length two years, with wheat followed by oilseed rape.  Clearly, the \nproportion of each crop in R1 is one third and of each crop in R2 is 0.5, and we have \nseen above how the rotations may be represented by a 3 \u00d7 3 and a 2 \u00d7 2 transition \nmatrix, respectively.  Currently in the UK, beans represent a much less profitable crop \nthan either wheat or oilseed rape.  However, the three-crop rotation with beans might \nhave the advantage of a lower incidence of pests and diseases.  A grower might then \nhave reasons to switch between these rotations, especially given the need to respond \nquickly to market forces.  This switching may itself be represented by a 2 \u00d7 2 \ntransition matrix, an example of which is shown in Table 2a. Here, the probabilities of \nstaying within the current rotations are r and s for rotations R1 and R2, respectively.  \nAll rows of such transition matrices sum to unity, so the probabilities of a change \nfrom R1 to R2 is 1 \u2013 r, and from R2 to R1 is 1 \u2013 s.   \n The system now consists of three transition matrices, which is mathematically \ncumbersome.  Fortunately however, this may be simplified by representing the three \nmatrices as a single transition matrix, which we denote here by U (Table 2b).  The \noverall transition matrix U is 5 \u00d7 5, composed of four blocks that represent the \ntransitions between individual crops of rotation R1 (3 \u00d7 3 top left block), R2 (2 \u00d7 2 \nbottom right block), R1 to R2 (3 \u00d7 2 top right block) and R2 to R1 (2 \u00d7 3 bottom left \nblock).  The entries in the first two square blocks of U are a copy of the individual \ntransition matrices R1 and R2, multiplied by the probability of remaining within their \nrespective rotations.   Each entry in the third and fourth rectangular blocks of U \nrepresents the probability of a change from a crop in one rotation to a crop in a \ndifferent rotation and for simplicity it is assumed that when such an event occurs the \ncrop in the new rotation is chosen at random, although this is not a strictly necessary \ncondition.  In this case, each entry in the third and fourth blocks of U is constructed by \ndividing the probability of changing from one rotation to the other by the number of \ncrops in the new rotation.  This process may easily be generalised to transitions \nbetween more than two rotations; the single overall matrix U that results will always \nbe square with the number of rows and columns equal to the sum of the number of \ncrops over all the individual rotations. \n \n 9 \/ 13 \n  \na). Rotation 1 (R1) \n  \nb). Rotation 2 (R2) \n  \nc). Transitions between rotations R1 & R2 \n \nFigure 2. Schematic diagrams of transitions between example rotations a).

Transitions between rotations  \na) Example of a simple transition matrix representing the probabilities of transitions between \ntwo rotations, R1 and R2.  The probabilities of staying within the current rotations are r and s \nfor rotations R1 and R2, respectively.  All rows of such transition matrices sum to unity. \n \n Current year \n  Rotation R1 Rotation R2 \nRotation R1 r 1 - r Previous year \nRotation R2 1 - s s \nb). When the rotation R1 is a fixed three-year sequence of wheat, oilseed rape (OSR) and \nbeans, and the rotation R2 is a fixed two-year sequence of wheat and oilseed rape, the three \ntransition matrices representing R1, R2 and the transition between them described in a, may \nall be represented by the single 5 \u00d7 5 overall transition matrix, U.  The entries in the matrix U \nare formed by considering the four blocks shown, that represent the transitions between \nindividual crops of rotation R1 (3 \u00d7 3 top left block), R2 (2 \u00d7 2 bottom right block), R1 to R2 \n(3 \u00d7 2 top right block) and R2 to R1 (2 \u00d7 3 bottom left block).  See text for further details. \n \n Current year\n   (R1)  (R2) \n   Wheat OSR Beans  Wheat OSR \nWheat 0 r 0  (1 - r) \/ 2 (1 - r) \/ 2 \nOSR 0 0 r  (1 - r) \/ 2 (1 - r) \/ 2 \n(R1) \nBeans r 0 0 (1 - r) \/ 2 (1 - r) \/ 2\nWheat (1 - s) \/ 3 (1 - s) \/ 3 (1 - s) \/ 3 0 s \nPrevious year \n(R2) \nOSR (1 - s) \/ 3 (1 - s) \/ 3 (1 - s) \/ 3  s 0 \n \n As an example, consider the above system, with r = 0.7 and s = 0.9.  The \ngreater chance of transition from R1 to R2 than vice-versa is reflected in the long-\nterm probability of being in each rotation in a given future year, which are calculable \nusing the methods in section 4 (i.e. matrix multiplications), and which are 0.25 for R1 \nand 0.75 for R2.  The long-term average crop proportions for the three crops are 0.458 \nfor both wheat and oilseed rape (composed of 0.75\/2 + 0.25\/3) and 0.083 for beans \n 10 \/ 13 \n(composed of 0.25\/3).  This strategy provides proportions of wheat and oilseed rape \nconsiderably closer to those of R2 (0.5 each) than to R1 (0.333 each).   \n Another example of interest is where one of r or s is unity, which models the \nsituation where, once a transition to another rotation has been made, this becomes \nfixed, with no possibility of return.  For example, consider the case of r = 0.7, as \nbefore, but now with s = 1, so that a transition may occur from R1 to R2 but not vice-\nversa.  Hence, in the long term, the probability of still being in rotation R1 approaches \never closer to zero (indeed, by the end of the tenth year it is less than 0.03).  \nFurthermore, since all the column elements that relate to the three crops of R1 of the \nmatrix Un (see section 4, above) have the form 0.7n, these elements tend to zero as n \nincreases.  Hence, in the long term, the proportion of crops in rotation R1 declines to \nzero and the only proportions relevant are those for crops in rotation R2, which are 0.5 \nfor both wheat and oilseed rape. \n A final example is presented to model the situation where a change of rotation \nfrom R1 to R2 becomes ever more likely due to some external driving trend, such as \nclimatic change.  Here, for simplicity, we again disallow a reversion to rotation R1 \nonce a change has been made from R1 to R2, so s = 1.  But now, r is a function of \ntime.  For example, consider the situation where a transition from R1 to R2 would \nhave been unthinkable at the beginning of the present century, but the probability of \nwhich increases steadily year by year until, by 2050, it becomes inevitable.  This may \nbe modelled by the equation: r = (2050 - Y)\/50, where Y represents the current year.  It \nis easy to substitute this variable value for r into software that implements an \nalgorithm to model such change. \n \n6. Discussion \nCrop rotations support sustainable crop production and soil quality over time \nby structuring the temporal succession of crops in fields. Rotations control the \ntemporal patterns of crops, they are a major component of agricultural landscapes. \nFour groups of rotations based on the flexibility of their structure were proposed in \nthis paper. These ranged from crop successions fixed in advance to unformed rotation \nwhich can be responsive to fluctuating environmental or market conditions. Models of \nagricultural landscapes incorporating spatially realistic variation in allocation of crops \nthrough time require the integration of the above mentioned rotation groups. The \ntransition matrix technique presented in this paper provides such models with a robust \nand flexible tool to manage crop rotations in a mathematical framework.  \nThe rotations are represented as probabilities of any crop grown succeeding \nother crops in the rotation. A major assumption of this method is that the choice of the \ncrop to grow (year n + 1) is based only upon the crop grown previously (year n). Two \ntechniques are available to mitigate this assumption. At first, dependencies of crops \nover several years can be imposed with fixed crop rotations (binary probabilities, i.e. \nonly one fixed crop rotation available), or by separating the instances of a crops (e.g. \nwheat crop present twice in a transition matrix to separate the contexts of its \noccurrences). Secondly, in a model, the use of transition matrices can be \ncomplemented with stand-alone rules restricting crop successions over any required \ntime length. Such rules can be (i) restrictions on return period of crops, to prevent \nuntimely growing of crops; (ii) forbidden crop sequences, to avoid unacceptable \nsuccessions of crops in a field; or (iii) maximum acceptable repetitions of a crop, to \nprevent continuous growing of that crop.  \nBy using the properties of the transition matrices, the long-term crop \nproportions of any rotation can be determined. This possibility is of particular \n 11 \/ 13 \nimportance for crop rotation modelling at the landscape scale. By knowing the long-\nterm crop proportions of each potential rotation and the areas of each field, rotation \nallocation to fields can be optimised towards specific user-defined crop proportions \nover the whole landscape. This provides a means to control crop proportions at the \nlandscape scale, and is essential to generate coherent crop allocation at the landscape \nlevel.  \nThe creation of transition matrices adapted to the agricultural landscape under \nstudy requires expert knowledge on the type of crop rotation to model, and an \nunderstanding of the internal dynamics of crop successions. Such knowledge may be \nderived from research on farmers\u2019 decision-making of crop succession, agronomical \nadvisers or even from statistical analyses of agricultural censuses from modelling past \nor present agronomical practices. For modelling crop rotations in evolving landscapes, \n(e.g. due to climate change or market fluctuations) the transition matrix method can be \nadapted to incorporate a dependency upon an external variable, as in the example \nrelating probabilities of growing a crop to long-term temperature variation, or to allow \nthe transition between different crop rotations. Therefore, the matrices provide the \nopportunity to investigate potential changes in land use due to variation in favoured \ncrops because of changing environmental or economic conditions.  \nSimulation models incorporating these ideas can compute and suggest \nstrategies relating to crop rotations and temporal patterns of crops at the landscape \nscale. The techniques outlined here have already been incorporated in the open-source \nsoftware package, LandSFACTS \n(http:\/\/www.rothamsted.bbsrc.ac.uk\/pie\/LandSFACTS), created to model realistic \ncrop allocation to fields to meet user-defined constraints on crop spatio-temporal \npatterns at the landscape scale over multiple years. The use of the transition matrices \nto represent crop rotations allows the software to be useable on any agricultural \nlandscapes, regardless of the type of crops or crop rotations in place. LandSFACTS is \nspecifically designed to support the creation of scenarios of realistic crop arrangement \nat the landscape scale. Such scenarios might require a specific crop proportion over \nthe landscape, or temporal occurrence of a crop. It is currently being used by \nresearchers to investigate the environmental and economic impacts of coexistence \nmeasures for growing GM crops on European agricultural landscapes by the EU-\nfunded project SIGMEA (http:\/\/sigmea.dyndns.org).  More specifically ongoing work \nis to evaluate the effect of crop patterns derived from crop rotations on the efficacy of \ncoexistence measures. Scenarios of crop arrangement developed for this purpose are \nfor example focusing on (i) the relative proportions of GM and conventional crops \nover the years, e.g. 10%, 50% or 75% of oilseed rape crops as GM varieties, (ii) the \nspatial repartition of the rotations with GM crops within the landscape, i.e. spatially \nlimited to an area or homogeneously widespread through the landscape, (iii) temporal \nand spatial separation distances between crops, such as 500m imposed between GM \nand conventional varieties of a crop or 3 years gap required between a growing a GM \nand a conventional varieties of a crop. LandSFACTS will also be useful in \napplications such as modelling erosion or diffuse pollution, where the realistic \ngenerated crop allocations can be used as an input to more mechanistic models. \n Further work is now required, in addition to the analytical methods described \nby Castellazzi et al. (2007), to develop methods to estimate the probabilities of \ntransitions from crop to crop in crop rotations.  \n \n \n 12 \/ 13 \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was carried out within the framework of the European Union funded \nSIGMEA project (http:\/\/sigmea.dyndns.org\/).
