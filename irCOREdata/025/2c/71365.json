Introduction and main results\nLet X be a smooth manifold, and \u00b5 a \u03c3-finite positive Radon measure on X . Suppose\nthat L is an operator of Laplace type over X , so that L defines a positive and self-adjoint\noperator in a dense linear subspace of L2(\u00b5) with core C\u221ec (X) ; to avoid possible ambiguity,\nwe further suppose that the spectral projection corresponding to the singleton set {0} is\nzero. Any bounded and Borel measurable function G : (0,\u221e) \u2192 C gives rise to a bounded\nlinear operator G(L) on L2(\u00b5) by the spectral theorem.\nThe solutions to the abstract Cauchy problem \u2202u\/\u2202t = iLu , u(0, x) = f(x), for the\nSchro\u00a8dinger equation are given by u(t, x) = eitLf(x) ; althought this problem is well-posed\nfor initial data f \u2208 L2(\u00b5) , one typically obtains \u00b5-almost sure convergence to the initial\ndata, u(t, x) \u2192 f(x) as t \u2192 0 , only for f in a proper subspace of L2(\u00b5) [12, 16]. The\npapers [9, 5] introduced a technique for proving such results, based upon analysis of the\nmaximal operators f 7\u2192 supt>0 |G(tL)f(x)| . Using the Mellin transform of G , one can\nreduce the analysis of the maximal operator to the group Liv of imaginary powers of L .\nTypically this defines a C0-group on L\np(\u00b5) (1 < p <\u221e) , which is not uniformly bounded\nfor p 6= 2 [17]. In this paper we achieve new maximal theorems for operator families defined\nusing such groups. To obtain estimates on various operators by transference methods, it\n1\nis necessary to restrict attention to a special class of Banach spaces which includes Lp(\u00b5)\n(1 < p <\u221e) .\nDefinition. For E a complex Banach space, the Bochner-Lebesgue space Lp(\u00b5;E)\nconsists of strongly measurable E-valued functions f on X for which the norm\n\u2016f\u2016Lp(\u00b5;E) =\n(\u222b\nX \u2016f(s)\u2016pE\u00b5(ds)\n)1\/p\nis finite. And E is said to be a UMD space, if the\nHilbert transform\nH(f)(t) = PV\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nf(t \u2212 s) ds\npis\n(f \u2208 Lp(R;E)) (1.1)\ndefines a bounded linear operator on Lp(R;E) for 1 < p <\u221e . See [3, 6, 7] for examples.\nWhen E is a UMD Banach space, one seeks to extend the definition of Liv to\nLiv \u2297 IdE on Lp(\u00b5;E) by using the functional calculus of spectral integration [2, 3]; for\nnotational simplicity, one then writes Liv for this operator. The domain of the generator\ni logL of the group Liu in Lp(\u00b5;E) has the usual graph norm\n\u2016f\u2016D(logL) = \u2016f\u2016Lp(\u00b5;E) + \u2016(logL)f\u2016Lp(\u00b5;E).\nUsing a much improved version of the technique of [5], we obtain in section two results\nfor maximal functions associated with operator families G(tL) on Lp(\u00b5;E) . Our first\napplication Theorem 3.1 relates to the maximal operator for the holomorphic extension\nof the heat semigroup Ht = e\n\u2212tL , when Liv is of exponential growth of rate less than\npi\/2 . In section three we also obtain, under stronger hypotheses, bounds on the solution\noperator for the wave and Schro\u00a8dinger equations. Our main result is:\nTheorem 1.1. Suppose that Liv (v \u2208 R) defines a C0-group on Lp(\u00b5;E) for some\n1 < p <\u221e and UMD Banach space E , with\n\u2016Liv\u2016B(Lp(\u00b5;E)) \u2264 C(1 + |v|\u03b2) (v \u2208 R) (1.2)\nwhere \u03b2 < 1\/2 . Then (a) the wave sine family sin t\n\u221a\nL\/t\n\u221a\nL (t > 0) defines a uniformly\nbounded family of linear operators on Lp(\u00b5;E) and the sublinear maximal operator W\u2217 :\nDLp(\u00b5;E)(logL) \u2192 Lp(\u00b5) is bounded, where\nW\u2217 : f 7\u2192 sup\nt>0\n\u2225\u2225\u2225 sin t\n\u221a\nL\nt\n\u221a\nL\nf(x)\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\nE\n(f \u2208 DLp(\u00b5;E)(logL)). (1.3)\n(b) Likewise, the family of Schro\u00a8dinger sine operators sin tL\/tL (t > 0) is uniformly\nbounded on Lp(\u00b5;E) and the sublinear maximal operator S\u2217 : DLp(\u00b5;E)(logL) \u2192 Lp(\u00b5)\nis bounded, where\nS\u2217 : f 7\u2192 sup\nt>0\n\u2225\u2225\u2225sin tL\ntL\nf(x)\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\nE\n(f \u2208 DLp(\u00b5;E)(logL)). (1.4)\n2\nIn section four we derive some consequences for the Euclidean Laplace operator.\nWe shall show that the maximal operator W\u2217 of (1.3) has similar properties to the\nHardy-Littlewood maximal operator. The relations between the various maximal operators\nare discussed in section six.\nOur main Maximal Lemma 2.3 also has surprising consequences for Cesa`ro summa-\nbility of orthogonal series. Let (\u03d5n) (n \u2208 N) be an orthonormal basis of L2(\u00b5) for some\nprobability measure on X , and for f \u2208 L2(\u00b5) write f \u223c \u2211n an\u03d5n for the orthogonal\nseries generated by f . For a real sequence of \u03bbn \u2265 1 with \u03bbn \u2192 \u221e as n \u2192 \u221e , we\ncan introduce a self-adjoint and positive operator in L2(\u00b5) by setting L\u03d5n = \u03bbn\u03d5n and\nextending linearly. In section five we prove results including the following:\nTheorem 1.2. Suppose \u03b4 > 0 and that f belongs to the domain of logL , so\u2211\nn(1 + log \u03bbn)\n2|an|2 < \u221e . Then\n\u2211\nn an\u03d5n(x) is almost everywhere (C, \u03b4) summable to\nf(x) , so \u2211\nn:\u03bbn\u2264N\n(\n1\u2212 \u03bbn\nN\n)\u03b4\nan\u03d5n(x) \u2192 f(x) (1.5)\n\u00b5-almost everywhere as N \u2192\u221e .\nIn this context, it is natural to have maximal operators defined only on the domain\nof logL , as illustrated by the theorem of Menshov [15]:\nGiven \u03b5 > 0 , there exists an orthonormal basis (\u03d5n) (n \u2208 N) of L2[0, 1] for which\nthe maximal partial sum operator\n\u2211\nn an\u03d5n 7\u2192 supN(x) |\n\u2211N(x)\nn=1 an\u03d5n(x)| is unbounded\nDL2((logL)\n1\u2212\u03b5) \u2192 L1[0, 1] where L is determined by \u03bbn = n+ 1 (n \u2208 N).\nThe proof of the main Maximal Lemma in section two involves a functional calculus\nargument which the reader may find more congenial when expressed in the language of\nFourier transforms. For \u03ba, \u03b2 > 0 , let A\u03b2,\u03ba be the space of holomorphic functions g(z) on\n\u2126\u03b2 = {z : |=z| < \u03b2} which have (a) e\u03bazg(z) and (b) e\u2212\u03bazg\u2032(z) bounded on \u2126\u03b2 . It is easy\nto verify that any such g is itself bounded on \u2126\u03b2 , and hence that A\u03b2,\u03ba forms a Banach\nalgebra under pointwise multiplication for the norm\n\u2016g\u2016A\u03b2,\u03ba = sup\nz\u2208\u2126\u03b2\n{|g(z)|} + sup\nz\u2208\u2126\u03b2\n{|e\u03bazg(z)|}+ sup\nz\u2208\u2126\u03b2\n{|e\u2212\u03bazg\u2032(z)|}. (1.6)\nTheorem 1.3. Let E be a UMD Banach space, and Tt = e\nitA a C0-group of\noperators on E , with \u2016Tt\u2016B(E) \u2264Me\u03b1|t| (t \u2208 R) . Then, for any \u03b2 > \u03b1 and \u03ba > 0 , there\nis a bounded homomorphism A\u03b2,\u03ba \u2192 B(E) : g 7\u2192 g(A) for any \u03ba > 0 .\nThe main idea in the proof is that g\u02c6(u + iv) =\n\u222b\u221e\n\u2212\u221e g(x + iy)e\n\u2212i(x+iy)(u+iv)dx is\nindependent of \u2212\u03b2 < y < \u03b2 by Cauchy\u2019s Theorem, and defines a holomorphic function on\n3\n{u+ iv : 0 < v < \u03ba,\u2212\u221e < u <\u221e} . Using (b) and an integration by parts argument, one\ncan extend g\u02c6 to a meromorphic function on \u2126\u03ba whose only possible singularity is a simple\npole at zero. Further, for any \u03b2 \u2032 < \u03b2 and \u03ba\u2032 < \u03ba , the extended function g\u02c6(u+ iv) decays\nat exponential rate \u03b2 \u2032 uniformly on \u2126\u03ba\u2032 as u\u2192 \u00b1\u221e .\nThe functional calculus map is\ng 7\u2192 lim\n\u03b5\u21920+\n1\n2pi\n\u222b \u2212\u03b5\n\u2212\u221e\n+\n\u222b \u221e\n\u03b5\ng\u02c6(u)Tudu\u2212 i\n2\nRes(g\u02c6; 0)IdE, (1.7)\nwherein the integrals converge at infinity on account of the exponential decay of the Fourier\ntransform, while the singularity at zero may be treated by transference methods.\n2. Maximal Lemma for imaginary powers\nThroughout this section, we suppose 1 < p <\u221e , and E is a UMD Banach space. We also\nsuppose that the group of imaginary powers Liv (v \u2208 R) defines a C0-group on Lp(\u00b5;E)\nwhich satisfies\n\u2016Liv\u2016B(Lp(\u00b5;E)) \u2264MLe\u03b1|v| (v \u2208 R). (2.1)\nStein [17, p. 58] shows that the negative generator of any symmetric diffusion semigroup\ne\u2212tL satisfies (2.1) with \u03b1 \u2264 pi\/2 when E = C ; this gives us our main source of examples.\nSee also [4, 5.2].\nUsing the Mellin transform, we shall show that G(L) \u2297 IdE may be extended from\nC\u221ec (X) \u2297E to define a bounded linear operator G(L) on Lp(\u00b5;E) , provided G satisfies\nvarious technical conditions. We first impose a strong hypothesis, to be weakened later:\n(i) G(x)\/x1+\u03b3 is integrable over x in (0,\u221e) for \u2212\u03b4 < \u03b3 < \u03b4 , for some \u03b4 > 0 .\nThen the Mellin transform may be defined by G\u02dc(s) =\n\u222b\u221e\n0\nxs\u22121G(x) dx, where the\nintegral is absolutely convergent, and is a holomorphic function of s on the strip {s : \u2212\u03b4 <\n<s < \u03b4} . The Mellin inversion formula [20, p. 46] gives\nG(\u03bb) = lim\nR\u2192\u221e\n\u222b \u03b3+iR\n\u03b3\u2212iR\nG\u02dc(s)\u03bb\u2212sds\/2pii (\u2212\u03b4 < \u03b3 = <s < \u03b4) (2.2)\nat all points of differentiability of G . Similarly, if G\u02dc(\u03b3+iv) is integrable over v \u2208 (\u2212\u221e,\u221e)\nand differentiable at \u03b3 + it , then G(x) =\n\u222b \u03b3+i\u221e\n\u03b3\u2212i\u221e G\u02dc(s)x\n\u2212sds\/2pii satisfies G\u02dc(\u03b3 + it) =\nlim\u03b7\u21920+,R\u2192\u221e\n\u222b R\n\u03b7\nx\u03b3+it\u22121G(x)dx .\nFor 0 < \u03c6 < pi we introduce the sector K\u03c6 = {z : z 6= 0, | arg z| \u2264 \u03c6} and consider the\ncomplex functions G which are continuous on K\u03c6 and holomorphic on its interior. These\nassumptions will be in force throughout this section.\nWe recall the proof of a fundamental result [5, 9], in which we further suppose:\n(ii) G(z) \u2192 0 as |z| \u2192 0 and as |z| \u2192 \u221e in K\u03c6 , uniformly in | arg z| \u2264 \u03c6 ;\n(iii) r\u22121G(re\u00b1i\u03c6) are integrable over r \u2208 (0,\u221e) .\nProposition 2.1. Suppose that G satisfies (i), (ii) and (iii), for some pi > \u03c6 > \u03b1 .\nThen G(tL) (t > 0) defines a uniformly bounded family of operators on Lp(\u00b5;E) , and\nthe maximal operator f 7\u2192 supt>0 \u2016G(tL)f(x)\u2016E defines a bounded sublinear operator\nLp(\u00b5;E) \u2192 Lp(\u00b5) .\nProof. Using Cauchy\u2019s theorem and condition (ii), we can turn the line of integration\nin the definition of the Mellin transform to arg z = sgn(v)\u03c6 = \u03c8 and thereby achieve\nG\u02dc(iv) = e\u2212|v|\u03c6+i\u03c8\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nriv\u22121G(rei\u03c8 )dr (v \u2208 R). (2.3)\nBy the inversion formula, we can then write\nG(tL)f =\n1\n2pi\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nG\u02dc(iv)t\u2212ivL\u2212ivfdv (f \u2208 Lp(\u00b5;E), t > 0). (2.4)\nFor any x \u2208 X , we have by the triangle inequality\nsup\nt>0\n\u2016G(tL)f(x)\u2016E \u2264 1\n2pi\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n|G\u02dc(iv)|\u2016L\u2212ivf(x)\u2016Edv, (2.5)\nsince |t\u2212iv| = 1 . Taking the Lp(\u00b5) norm of both sides gives\n\u2225\u2225sup\nt>0\n\u2016G(tL)f\u2016E\n\u2225\u2225\nLp(\u00b5)\n\u2264 1\n2pi\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n|G\u02dc(iv)|\u2016L\u2212ivf\u2016Lp(\u00b5;E)dv (2.6)\n\u2264 1\n2pi\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n|G\u02dc(iv)|\u2016L\u2212iv\u2016B(Lp(\u00b5;E))dv \u00d7 \u2016f\u2016Lp(\u00b5;E)\nfor any f \u2208 Lp(\u00b5;E) ; and the latest integral is convergent since the exponential decay rate\nof the Mellin transform exceeds the growth rate of the group by (2.3) and (iii).\nUnfortunately, neither condition (i) nor (ii) is satisfied in many cases of interest, such\nas Theorems 1.1, 3.1 and Corollary 4.1(a) and (b), wherein the Mellin transform G\u02dc(s)\nhas a simple pole at s = 0 . Consequently, the constant C(p, \u03b1) of Cowling\u2019s fundamental\ninequality [9, p. 276] becomes infinite, and one cannot control (the maximal function of)\nthe family G(tL) (t > 0) by a simple application of the triangle inequality. The main\ntechnical contribution of the present paper is to use transference methods to overcome this\ndifficulty. This involves restricting the range of values of p , restricting the class of Banach\nspaces and defining the maximal operator on a proper subspace of Lp(\u00b5;E) .\n5\nLemma 2.2. Suppose that for some \u03ba > 0 and 0 < \u03c6 < pi :\n(iv) G(z) is holomorphic with continuous derivative inside and on the boundary of\nK\u03c6 , including z = 0 ; and\n(v) G(rei\u03b8)r\u03ba \u2192 0 as r \u2192\u221e , uniformly for |\u03b8| \u2264 \u03c6 .\nThen G\u02dc(s) extends to define a holomorphic function on the strip {s : \u22121 < <s < \u03ba} ,\napart possibly from a simple pole at s = 0 . Further, G(s) decays to zero at exponential\nrate \u03c6 , uniformly for \u22121\/2 \u2264 <s \u2264 \u03ba\/2 as =s \u2192\u00b1\u221e .\nProof. For 0 < <s < \u03ba , the Mellin transform integral is absolutely convergent and de-\nfines a holomorphic function on this strip by Morera\u2019s theorem. By applying Cauchy\u2019s The-\norem to zs\u22121G(z) on the contour made up of the straight line segments [\u03b4,R] , [\u03b4ei\u03b8, Rei\u03b8]\nand the circular arcs joining \u03b4 to \u03b4ei\u03b8 and R to Rei\u03b8 respectively, we can turn the line of\nintegration to arg z = \u03b8 for any \u2212\u03c6 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c6 . Letting \u03b4 \u2192 0+ and R\u2192\u221e , we derive the\nidentity\nG\u02dc(s) = ei\u03b8s\n(G(ei\u03b8)\ns\n\u2212 1\ns\n\u222b 1\n0\nrsG\u2032(rei\u03b8)dr +\n\u222b \u221e\n1\nrs\u22121G(rei\u03b8)dr\n)\n(|\u03b8| \u2264 \u03c6, 0 < <s < \u03ba)\n(2.7)\nby splitting the range of integration and integrating by parts.\nOne can use the right-hand side of (2.7) to continue G\u02dc(s) across the imaginary axis\nto a meromorphic function on {s : \u22121 < <s < \u03ba} , whose only possible singularity is a\nsimple pole at s = 0 . On account of the initial exponential factor, it also follows that\n|G\u02dc(u+ iv)| \u2264 CGe\u2212\u03c6|v| for \u22121\/2 \u2264 u \u2264 \u03ba\/2 and |v| \u2265 1 for some CG <\u221e .\nMaximal Lemma 2.3. Let G be as in Lemma 2.2, and suppose Liu satisfies (2.1),\nfor some pi > \u03c6 > \u03b1 . Then G(tL) (t > 0) defines a uniformly bounded family of linear\noperators on Lp(\u00b5;E) ; further, the maximal operator f 7\u2192 supt>0 \u2016G(tL)f\u2016E defines a\nbounded sublinear operator DLp(\u00b5;E)(logL) \u2192 Lp(\u00b5) .\nProof. For \u03b7 > 0 sufficiently small, the Mellin inversion formula may be applied to\nG\u02dc(s+ \u03b7) , the Mellin transform of x\u03b7G(x) . One can then use Cauchy\u2019s theorem to deform\nthe line of integration into a curve avoiding s = 0 . On letting \u03b7 \u2192 0 , this contour may in\nturn be replaced by the sum of a principal value integral and the contribution of the pole\nat zero. Consequently, for f \u2208 Lp(\u00b5;E) and t > 0 we can use the Mellin inversion formula\nto write\nG(tL)f =\n1\n2pi\n\u222b \u221e\n1\n+\n\u222b 1\n\u2212\u221e\nG\u02dc(iv)t\u2212ivL\u2212ivfdv\n+ PV\n1\n2pi\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\nG\u02dc(iv)t\u2212ivL\u2212ivfdv + 2\u22121Res(G\u02dc; 0)f. (2.8)\n6\nThe integrals over (1,\u221e) and (\u2212\u221e,\u22121) may be bounded by the argument of Propo-\nsition 2.1, whereas the final integral in (2.8) requires a more subtle argument: starting\nwith the decomposition G\u02dc(iv) = b\/iv+h(v) , where b is a constant and h(v) is continuous\nnear to the simple pole at v = 0 , we have an identity of principal value integrals\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\nG\u02dc(iv)t\u2212ivL\u2212ivfdv =\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\nh(v)t\u2212ivL\u2212ivfdv + b\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\n(tL)\u2212ivf\ndv\niv\n. (2.9)\nThe first of there integrals is clearly bounded with bound independent of t as in Proposition\n2.1. The last is the transferred finite Hilbert transform for the representation v 7\u2192 (tL)\u2212iv\nof R on Lp(\u00b5;E) , and by [3; 4, Theorem 4.1] this operator is bounded with bound in-\ndependent of t . Together these estimates show that G(tL) (t > 0) defines a uniformly\nbounded family of linear operators.\nTo control the associated maximal operator, we take f \u2208 DLp(\u00b5;E)(logL) and write\nthe last integral in (2.8) as a sum of principal value integrals\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\nG\u02dc(iv)t\u2212ivL\u2212ivfdv =\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\nh(v)t\u2212ivL\u2212ivfdv +\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\nt\u2212iv \u2212 1\niv\n(L\u2212iv \u2212 I)fdv\n+\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\nt\u2212iv\niv\nfdv +\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\nL\u2212ivf\ndv\niv\n\u2212\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\ndv\niv\nf. (2.10)\nThe first of these integrals may be treated as in Proposition 2.1. The latest integral is zero;\nthe second last is independent of t > 0 and is the transferred finite Hilbert transform, hence\nmay be controlled as in (2.9); the third last involves\n\u222b 1\n0\nsin(v log t)dv\/v , which is bounded\nindependent of t > 0 . It remains to control the second integral, which may be written as\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\n(t\u2212iv \u2212 1) 1\niv\n\u222b v\n0\nL\u2212iwdw(\u2212i logL)fdv (2.11)\nby definition of the group generator, wherein |t\u2212iv \u2212 1| \u2264 2 and\n\u2225\u2225\u2225 1\niv\n\u222b v\n0\nL\u2212iwdw\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\nB(Lp(\u00b5;E))\n\u2264 ML|v|\n\u222b |v|\n0\new\u03b1dw \u2264MLe\u03b1 (|v| \u2264 1) (2.12)\nby (2.1). Consequently we can take the supremum over t > 0 , and then the Lp(\u00b5) norm,\nto obtain\n\u2225\u2225\u2225sup\nt>0\n\u2225\u2225\u222b 1\n\u22121\nt\u2212iv \u2212 1\niv\n(L\u2212iv \u2212 I)fdv\u2225\u2225\nE\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\nLp(\u00b5)\n\u2264 2MLe\u03b1\n\u2225\u2225(logL)f\u2225\u2225\nLp(\u00b5;E)\n. (2.13)\nCombining all of these estimates gives the required bound on the maximal function.\n7\n3. Heat, wave and Schro\u00a8dinger maximal theorems\nOur first application of the Maximal Lemma is to the holomorphic semigroup e\u2212wL . This\nis associated with the heat equation, in the sense that U(w, x) = e\u2212wLf(x) satisfies\n\u2202U\/\u2202w = \u2212LU for w in a sector surrounding the semi-axis <w > 0 .\nTheorem 3.1. Let Liv (v \u2208 R) be a C0-group on Lp(\u00b5;E) for some UMD Banach\nspace E and 1 < p < \u221e , which satisfies (2.1) with \u03b1 < pi\/2 ; and let 0 < \u03c8 < pi\/2 \u2212 \u03b1 .\nThen (\u2212L) generates a holomorphic semigroup on Lp(\u00b5;E) , bounded in the sector {w :\n| argw| \u2264 \u03c8} ; and there exists C = C(E, p, \u03c8, \u03b1) < \u221e such that the associated maximal\noperator satisfies\n\u2225\u2225\u2225 sup\nw:| argw|\u2264\u03c8\n\u2225\u2225e\u2212wLf\u2225\u2225\nE\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\nLp(\u00b5)\n\u2264 CML\n(\n\u2016f\u2016Lp(\u00b5;E) + \u2016(logL)f\u2016Lp(\u00b5;E)\n)\n(3.1)\nfor all f in the domain of the group\u2019s generator i logL .\nProof. The existence of such a semigroup was established in [4, Corollary 4.2]. Let\n\u03c9 have |\u03c9| < \u03c8 < pi\/2 \u2212 \u03b1 , and set G\u03c9(z) = exp(\u2212ei\u03c9z) . One can verify (v) with any\n\u03c6 < pi\/2\u2212\u03c8 , or calculate the Mellin transform explicitly. Indeed G\u02dc\u03c9(s) equals \u0393(s)e\u2212is\u03c9 ,\nwhich satisfies the asymptotic relation\n|G\u02dc\u03c9(iv)| \u0010\n(2pi\n|v|\n)1\/2\ne\u03c9ve\u2212pi|v|\/2 (v \u2192 \u00b1\u221e) (3.2)\nby Stirling\u2019s formula [19, 4.4.1]; hence G\u02dc\u03c9(iv) is of exponential decay of rate at least\npi\/2 \u2212 \u03c8 > \u03b1 as v \u2192 \u00b1\u221e . Further, G\u02dc\u03c9(s) is holomorphic on a strip surrounding the\nimaginary axis, apart from a simple pole at zero with residue one.\nBy Lemma 2.3, exp(\u2212ei\u03c9tL) (t > 0, |\u03c9| \u2264 \u03c8) defines a uniformly bounded family of\nlinear operators on Lp(\u00b5;E) , and the associated maximal operator is bounded from the\ndomain of logL to Lp(\u00b5) .\n3.2 Proof of Theorem 1.1 (a) The function G(x) = sin\n\u221a\nx\/\n\u221a\nx (x > 0) has Mellin\ntransform G\u02dc(s) = \u22122\u0393(2s \u2212 1) cospis , with poles at s = \u2212n , with n \u2265 0 an integer [20,\np. 204]. Further, by Stirling\u2019s formula [19, 4.41], we have the asymptotic relation\nG\u02dc(iv) \u0010 \u2212\n\u221a\npi\n|v|3\/2 exp\n(\u2212pi|v|+ 2iv log 2|v|\/e\u2212 3piisgn(v)\/4) coshpiv (v \u2192 \u00b1\u221e), (3.3)\nwhich is of order |v|\u22123\/2 as v \u2192 \u00b1\u221e . The result follows as in Lemma 2.3.\n(b) The proof of Theorem 1.1(b) is similar.\n8\n4. Maximal operators for Euclidean wave and Schro\u00a8dinger operators\nThe Laplace operator \u2206 = \u2212\u2211dj=1 \u22022\u2202x2\nj\nis essentially self-adjoint on C\u221ec (R\nd; dx) and\nextends naturally to a closed linear operator in Lp(Rd; dx) for 1 \u2264 p <\u221e .\nFor this operator, d\u2019Alembert\u2019s solution of the wave equation gives a representation\nof the cosine family as averages over the unit sphere with respect to normalized Lebesgue\nmeasure, namely\ncos t\n\u221a\n\u2206f(x) =\n\u222b\n[|y|=1]\nf(x + ty)\u03c3d(dy) (f \u2208 C\u221ec (Rd)). (4.1)\nCorollary 4.1. Let 4d\/(2d+ 1) < p < 4d\/(2d\u2212 1) . Then\n(a) the maximal operator W\u2217 : DLp (log \u2206)\u2192 Lp(Rd) is bounded, where\nW\u2217 : f 7\u2192 sup\nt>0\n\u2223\u2223\u2223sin t\n\u221a\n\u2206\nt\n\u221a\n\u2206\nf(x)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223; (4.2)\n(b) similarly, the maximal operator S\u2217 : DLp (log \u2206)\u2192 Lp(Rd) is bounded, where\nS\u2217 : f 7\u2192 sup\nt>0\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 sin t\u2206\nt\u2206\nf(x)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223; (4.3)\n(c) and for 1 > \u03b3 > max{(p+2pd\u2212 4d)\/2p, (p+4d\u2212 2pd)\/2p} , the maximal operator\nf 7\u2192 sup\nt>0\n\u2223\u2223\u2223cos t\n\u221a\n\u2206\u2212 I\n(t\n\u221a\n\u2206)\u03b3\nf(x)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 (4.4)\nis bounded Lp(Rd) \u2192 Lp(Rd) .\nProof. (a), (b) Using the Marcinkiewicz multiplier theorem and interpolation as in\n[5, Lemma 3.1], one can achieve the bound \u2016\u2206iv\u2016B(Lp(Rd)) \u2264 Cp,d(1 + |v|)\u03b2 with \u03b2 < 1\/2\nfor such p and d . Hence the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1 are satisfied.\n(c) The Mellin transform of G(x) = (cos\n\u221a\nx \u2212 1)\/x\u03b3\/2 is found to be G\u02dc(s) =\n2\u0393(2s \u2212 \u03b3) cospi(2s \u2212 \u03b3)\/2 , which is holomorphic on the strip \u22121\/2 < <s < 1\/4 . This\nidentity may be deduced from the Mellin transform formula for the sine function [20, p.\n204] by integration by parts. Furthermore, by Stirling\u2019s formula and the bound on the\ngrowth of the group, the integral\n\u222b\u221e\n\u2212\u221e |G\u02dc(iv)|\u2016\u2206\u2212iv\u2016B(Lp)dv is convergent; and so we can\nargue as with (2.6). This may be compared to [5, Theorems 5.1, 5.2], and [9, Corollary 4].\nRemarks 4.2. (a) With d = 1 and L = \u2206, it follows from (4.1) that\nsin t\n\u221a\n\u2206\/t\n\u221a\n\u2206f(x) =\n\u222b t\n\u2212t f(x+u)du\/2t and the maximal operatorW\u2217 of (4.2) is simply the\nHardy-Littlewood maximal operator [14, p. 237], so Corollary 4.1(a) may be improved to\n9\nthe statement that W\u2217 is bounded on Lp(R) for 1 < p <\u221e . However, Theorem 1.1 does\nnot extend to the case of p = 1 . For it is easy to check that f(x) =\n\u222b 1\n\u22121 e\n\u2212(x\u2212y)2\/2dy\/\n\u221a\n2pi\nis integrable and belongs to D(log \u2206) (defined via the Fourier transform) in L1(R) ; but\nthe maximal function of f is not integrable.\n(b) The maximal operator f 7\u2192 supt>0 |eit\u2206f | is unbounded Lp(R) \u2192 Lploc(R) for\n1 \u2264 p < 2 [12, Theorem 2].\nThe following results improve upon the cases d = 1 and d \u2265 3 of Corollary 4.1(b)\nrespectively. Possibly they are known, but I have not able to locate a reference.\nProposition 4.3. Let \u2206 be the Laplacian over the real line. Then the maximal\noperator S\u2217 for the sine family sin t\u2206\/t\u2206 defines a bounded sublinear operator Lp(R) \u2192\nLp(R) for 1 < p <\u221e . Likewise, for the Laplacian over the circle, S\u2217 is bounded Lp(T) \u2192\nLp(T) for 1 < p <\u221e .\nProof. We can represent \u2206 by the Fourier multiplier \u2206ei\u03bex = \u03be2ei\u03bex , so S\u2217 may be\nviewed as the maximal convolution operator for the kernels Kt(x\u2212 y) which represent the\nmulipliers sin t\u03be2\/t\u03be2 . Indeed, we have Kt(x \u2212 y) = F ((x \u2212 y)\/\n\u221a\nt)\/\n\u221a\nt , where by Fourier\ninversion\nF (u) =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nsin \u03be2\n\u03be2\nei\u03beu\nd\u03be\n2pi\n(u \u2208 R). (4.5)\nBy considering the Fresnel integral F \u2032\u2032(u) , one can derive an asymptotic formula for\nF which implies |F (u)| \u2264 C\/(1 + u2) (u \u2208 R) for some C < \u221e . It follows that the sine\nfamily satisfies\nsin t\u2206\nt\u2206\nf(x) =\n1\u221a\nt\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nF ((x \u2212 y)\/\n\u221a\nt)f(y)dy\n\u2264C\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u221a\nt\nt+ (x \u2212 y)2 |f(y)|dy = CP\n\u221a\nt|f |(x), (4.6)\nwhere Pt = e\n\u2212t\u221a\u2206 is the Poisson semigroup for the upper half plane [14, p. 142]. By\nthe Hardy-Littlewood maximal theorem [14, p. 237], the maximal operator P\u2217 : f 7\u2192\nsupt>0 |Ptf(x)| defines a bounded sublinear operator Lp(R) \u2192 Lp(R) for 1 < p <\u221e ; and\nhence by (4.6), S\u2217 is likewise bounded on Lp(R) for all such p .\nTo show that S\u2217 is bounded on Lp(T) for 1 < p <\u221e , one uses the Poisson summation\nformula and the previous estimate to show that\n\u2223\u2223 \u2032\u2211\nn\nsinn2t\nn2t\nein(\u03b8\u2212\u03c6)\n\u2223\u2223 \u2264 C\n\u221a\nt\nt+ (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c6)2 + C (0 \u2264 \u03b8, \u03c6 \u2264 2pi) (4.7)\n10\nfor 0 < t < 1 . The proof then proceeds as before.\nProposition 4.4. For dimension d \u2265 3 and d\/(d\u22121) < p \u2264\u221e there exists Cp,d <\u221e\nsuch that all f \u2208 C\u221ec (Rd) satisfy\n\u2225\u2225S\u2217(f)\u2225\u2225Lp \u2264 Cp,d\n\u2225\u2225f\u2225\u2225\nLp\n.\nProof. We can use the spectral theorem and the Fourier inversion formula with (4.5)\nto obtain\nsin t\u2206\nt\u2206\nf(x) =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nF (u) cos u\n\u221a\n(t\u2206)f(x)du (4.8)\nfor smooth functions of compact support. Since F is integrable, the inequality S\u2217f(x) \u2264\nC supt>0 | cos t\n\u221a\n\u2206f(x)| follows by convexity. Stein [18, p. 518] has shown that the\nmaximal spherical averaging operator f 7\u2192 supt>0 | cos t\n\u221a\n\u2206f(x)| defines a strongly (p, p)\nbounded sublinear operator for this restricted range of p and d ; his proof depends upon\nFourier transform restriction phenomena. See also [16].\n5. Almost everywhere Cesaro summability of orthogonal series\nThroughout this section we let \u00b5 be a probability measure on X , and let (\u03d5n) (n \u2208 N)\nbe an orthonormal basis for L2(\u00b5) . For f \u2208 L2(\u00b5) we let f \u223c\u2211n an\u03d5n be the orthogonal\nseries generated by f . For a real sequence (\u00b5n) (n \u2208 N) with \u03bbn = |\u00b5n| \u2265 1 and \u03bbn \u2192\u221e\nas n \u2192 \u221e , we introduce a self-adjoint operator A in L2(\u00b5) by setting A\u03d5n = \u00b5n\u03d5n\nand extending linearly. Then Ut = e\nitA defines a C0 unitary group on L\n2(\u00b5) . We also\nintroduce the positive self-adjoint operator L by L\u03d5n = \u03bbn\u03d5n , so L\niu is a C0 unitary\ngroup on L2(\u00b5) .\nFor \u03b4 > 0 , we say that\n\u2211\nn an\u03d5n is Cesa`ro (C, \u03b4) summable to f at x , if\n\u2211\nn:\u03bbn<N\n(\n1\u2212 \u03bbn\nN\n)\u03b4\nan\u03d5n(x) \u2192 f(x) (N \u2192\u221e). (5.1)\nSee [11]. Note that the each sum on the left-hand side is finite. We write C\u03b4t f = (I\u2212tL)\u03b4+f\nfor the expression on the left-hand side, and C\u03b4\u2217f(x) = supt>0 |C\u03b4t f(x)| for the associated\nmaximal function.\n5.1 Proof of Theorem 1.3. We shall show that C\u03b4\u2217 is a bounded sublinear operator\nDL2(logL) \u2192 L2(\u00b5) . Almost everywhere convergence of the (C, \u03b4) Cesa`ro sums follows\nby standard and classical arguments. The Mellin transform of G(x) = (1\u2212 x)\u03b4+ is\nG\u02dc(s) =\n\u222b 1\n0\n(1 \u2212 x)\u03b4xs\u22121dx = \u0393(\u03b4 + 1)\u0393(s)\n\u0393(\u03b4 + 1 + s)\n, (5.2)\nwhich defines a holomorphic function on the strip R = {s : \u22121 < <s < 1} , apart from a\nsimple pole at s = 0 . Further, Stirling\u2019s formula leads to the estimate G\u02dc(s) = O(|s|\u22121\u2212\u03b4)\n11\nuniformly for s \u2208 R as |s| \u2192 \u221e . Arguing as in the proof of Lemma 2.3, we deduce that\nthe associated maximal operator C\u03b4\u2217f = supt>0 |G(tL)f | is bounded DL2(logL) \u2192 L2(\u00b5) .\nDefinition. A bounded linear operator U on L2(\u00b5) is said to be separation-preserving\nif, for any f and g in L2(\u00b5) with fg = 0 \u00b5-almost everywhere, (Uf)(Ug) = 0 also holds\n\u00b5-almost everywhere. A bounded linear operator U is said to be positivity preserving, if\nUf \u2265 0 , whenever f \u2265 0 . Any C0-group Ut (t \u2208 R) of positivity preserving operators is\nalso separation-preserving; see [1, p. 55].\nProposition 5.2. Suppose that the unitary group Ut = e\nitA has Ut separation-\npreserving for each t \u2208 R . Then for any f \u2208 L2(\u00b5) and \u03b4 > 0 , the series \u2211n an\u03d5n(x) is\n(C, \u03b4) summable to f(x) for \u00b5-almost all x .\nProof. The proof is based upon a transference technique, where we pass from the\ntranslation group \u03c4u : f(x) 7\u2192 f(x + u) on the line to the unitary group Ut on L2(\u00b5) . By\nthe spectral theorem, we can write for any f \u2208 L2(\u00b5)\n(I \u2212 tL)\u03b4+f(x) =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nh\u03b4(u)Utuf(x)du\/(2pi) (x \u2208 X), (5.3)\nwhere h\u03b4 is the Fourier transform of (1\u2212 |x|)\u03b4+ . One can show that |h\u03b4(u)| \u2264\n\u03ba\u03b4(1 + u\n2)\u2212(1+\u03b4)\/2 (u \u2208 R) for some \u03ba\u03b4 < \u221e . The operator (I \u2212 tL)\u03b4+ may thus be\nobtained by transferring to L2(\u00b5) the bounded convolution operator\n\u222b\u221e\n\u2212\u221e h\u03b4(u)\u03c4tudu on\nL2(R) ; further, by the theorem 2.3 of [1], the maximal operator for the family (I \u2212 tL)\u03b4+\nmay be obtained by transference of the corresponding maximal convolution operator. To\ncheck that the latter is strongly (2, 2) bounded, we note that for any g \u2208 L2(R) we have\nsup\nt>0\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nh\u03b4(u)\u03c4tug(x)du\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 sup\nt>0\n\u03ba\u03b4\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n1\n(1 + u2)(1+\u03b4)\/2\n|g(x+ tu)|du (5.4)\n\u2264 sup\nt>0\n(1 + \u03b4)\u03ba\u03b4\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nu2\n(1 + u2)(\u03b4+3)\/2\n1\nu\n\u222b u\n\u2212u\n|g(x+ tv)|dvdu,\nwhere the last step follows from Fubini\u2019s theorem. The latest integral is a convex com-\nbination of averages of |g| , and so is strongly (2, 2) bounded by the Hardy-Littlewood\nmaximal averages theorem [14, p. 237]. By the transference theorem for maximal opera-\ntors, supt>0(I \u2212 tL)\u03b4+ is likewise strongly (2, 2) bounded, as required.\nThis proof of Proposition 5.2 ultimately reduced to the following observation:\n12\nProposition 5.3. Suppose that t 7\u2192 eitA is a bounded and strongly continuous\nrepresentation of R on Lp(\u00b5) , for some 1 < p <\u221e , with each eitA separation-preserving;\nand let \u03b4 > 0 . Then there exists \u03ba\u03b4 < \u221e such that C\u03b4\u2217f \u2264 \u03ba\u03b4S\u2217f for all f ; and S\u2217 is\nbounded Lp(\u00b5) \u2192 Lp(\u00b5) .\n6. Subordination of maximal functions\nLet X be a complete Riemannian manifold with metric \u03c1 and measure \u00b5 . We let L be the\nLaplace operator in L2(\u00b5) , which is positive and self-adjoint. The wave operator cos t\n\u221a\nL\nhas a distributional kernel cos t\n\u221a\nL(x, y) supported on the strip {(x, y) \u2208 X2 : \u03c1(x, y) \u2264 t}\nsurrounding the diagonal x = y ; thus the solutions to the wave equation are of finite\npropagation speed [8]. In view of Remark 4.2(a), it is natural to regard the maximal\nfunctionW\u2217 for the wave sine family sin t\n\u221a\nL\/t\n\u221a\nL as the analogue of the Hardy-Littlewood\nmaximal function.\nThe Poisson semigroup may be defined by\nPtf(x) = e\n\u2212t\n\u221a\nLf(x) =\n1\npi\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nt\nt2 + u2\ncosu\n\u221a\nLf(x)du (6.1)\nfor f \u2208 L2(\u00b5) , and it extends to define a symmetric diffusion semigroup on Lp(\u00b5) for\n1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e [8, 17]. Here V (t, x) = Ptf(x) defines a harmonic function, in the sense\nthat (\u22022\/\u2202t2 \u2212 L)V (t, x) = 0 on (0,\u221e) \u00d7X . The maximal functions for the Poisson and\nheat semigroups are denoted P\u2217f(x) = supt>0 |Ptf(x)| and H\u2217f(x) = supt>0 |Htf(x)|\nrespectively. These may be compared pointwise in the following result.\nProposition 6.1. The maximal functions satisfy:\n(a) P\u2217f(x) \u2264 H\u2217f(x) \u2264W\u2217f(x) for all f \u2208 C\u221ec (X) and x \u2208 X ; and\n(b) C\u03b4\u2217f(x) \u2264 \u03ba\u03b4S\u2217f(x) for some constant \u03ba\u03b4 where 1 < \u03b4 < 2 .\n(c) S\u2217f(x) \u2264 \u03baP\u2217f(x) , whenever cos t\n\u221a\nL (t > 0) is positivity preserving.\nProof. The Possion and heat semigroups Ht = e\n\u2212tL are related by the Bochner\nsubordination formula [17, p. 47]\nPtf(x) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nHt2\/vf(x)e\n\u2212vdv\/\n\u221a\n(vpi); (6.2)\nwhereas one can obtain the relation\nHtf(x) =\n\u221a\n2\npi\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ns2e\u2212s\n2\/2 sin s\n\u221a\n(2tL)\ns\n\u221a\n(2tL)\nf(x)ds (6.3)\nby integration by parts and Fourier inversion [8]. And so by convexity the maximal func-\ntions satisfy (a).\n13\n(b) We take 1 < \u03b4 < 2 and introduce h\u03b4(u) =\n\u222b 1\n\u22121(1\u2212|x|)\u03b4 cosuxdx, which is a contin-\nuously differentiable and integrable function on R . Using repeated partial integration, one\nshows that \u03c3\u03b4(u) = \u2212uh\u2032\u03b4(u) is integrable over R . By Fourier inversion and integration\nby parts, one obtains\n(1\u2212 tL)\u03b4+ =\n1\n2pi\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nsinutL\nutL\n\u03c3\u03b4(u)du (6.4)\nfrom the spectral theorem. Now (b) follows by convexity, with \u03ba\u03b4 =\n\u222b\u221e\n\u2212\u221e |\u03c3\u03b4(u)|du\/2pi .\n(c) This follows from (4.8) and (6.1) since F (u) \u2264 C\/(1 + u2) .\nRemarks 6.2. (1) On account of (4.1), the hypothesis of 6.1(b) is satisfied by the\nEuclidean Laplace operator.\n(2) The inequality 6.1(b) is the basis for Hardy\u2019s theorem on the almost everywhere\nsummability of classical Fourier series [11, Theorem 3] over T ; the method of Kolmogorov-\nSeliverstov is rather different in that it involves detailed analysis of kernel functions [13].\n(3) Results concerning spherical sums of classical Fourier series over Td with p 6= 2\nare sensitive to dimension. Carleson and Sjo\u00a8lin showed that the operators (I \u2212 t\u2206)\u03b4+ are\nbounded Lp(R2) \u2192 Lp(R2) for 4\/3 \u2264 p \u2264 4 for t, \u03b4 > 0 . Using our method with [5,\nLemma 3.1] and (5.2), one obtains the weaker result that the (I \u2212 t\u2206)\u03b4+ (t > 0) are\nuniformly bounded Lp(R2) \u2192 Lp(R2) for 4\/(2 + \u03b4) < p < 4\/(2 \u2212 \u03b4) . By contrast, \u03b4 = 0\ngives the multiplier for the disc, which is famously unbounded on Lp(R2) for p 6= 2 [10].\nAcknowledgements. I should like to thank G.J.O. Jameson, T.A. Gillespie and\nE.B.
