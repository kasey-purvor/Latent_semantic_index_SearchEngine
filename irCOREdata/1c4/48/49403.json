In three Experiments, children (N = 37; 30; 59) identified a hidden toy\nby seeing, feeling, or by being told, having had two modes of access on each trial, one\ninformative (e.g. seeing a toy identified by colour) and the other uninformative (e.g.\nbeing told the toy\u2019s colour by the Experimenter who had only felt it). Children who\nanswered the know question wrongly nevertheless reported accurately who saw and\nwho felt the toy, and what the well-informed player had said. They also realised when\nthe Experimenter\u2019s uninformative access implied their own knowledge was\nunreliable, suggesting precocious working understanding of knowledge sources.\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n3\nWhat Children Know About the Source of their Knowledge\nWithout Reporting it as the Source.\nKnowing how we know plays a central role in many aspects of adult decision-\nmaking (Johnson, Hashtroudi & Lindsay, 1993), and inaccurate beliefs about the\nsources of our knowledge can have serious consequences for our assessments of the\nreliability of our knowledge. For example, a person who believes he has seen for\nhimself something he was only told about, may over-estimate the likely truth of that\nbelief. Adults sometimes make such errors of source attribution, but young children\nhave a much greater problem and make surprising errors under conditions that would\nbe trivially easy for adults. In particular, we have known for twenty years that\nchildren aged three to four years are poor at reporting the source of knowledge they\nhave only just acquired (Gopnik & Graf, 1988; Wimmer, Hogrefe & Perner, 1988),\nand interpretations made on the basis of these early studies remain largely\nunchallenged. In a typical study children gain knowledge about an object by seeing it,\nor feeling it, or being told about it. Shortly afterwards they are asked to report back\nwhat they know, and how they know it. Children aged 3- to 4- years are usually\naccurate at reporting the content of their knowledge, but relatively poor at saying how\nthey know, how they found out, or how they learned the item in question (e.g.\nDrummey & Newcombe, 2002; Gopnik & Graf, 1988; O'Neill & Gopnik, 1991;\nPerner & Ruffman, 1995; Taylor, Esbensen & Bennett, 1994; Wimmer, Hogrefe &\nPerner, 1988).\nWithin the literature on children\u2019s developing conceptions of the mind, such\nsource reporting errors are treated as an indication of a failure to understand the causal\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n4\nconnection between information access and knowledge state. As such, they are\nconsidered to be qualitatively different from adults\u2019 source attribution errors.\nImportantly, errors suggesting a similar failure to understand about the knowing\nprocess occur in a number of quite different tasks, suggesting that children do not\nsimply misunderstand the intended meaning of the question \u201cHow do you know\u2026?\u201d\n(e.g. Naito, 2003; O'Neill, Astington & Flavell, 1992; O'Neill & Chong, 2001; Pillow,\n1993). For example, 3- to 4- year olds make incorrect decisions about whether to look\nat or feel an object to find out its colour (O'Neill, Astington & Flavell, 1992; Pillow,\n1993), and they are poor at re-enacting what they just did to find out an object's smell\nor feel (O'Neill & Chong, 2001).\nAlthough there is widespread agreement that young children\u2019s errors in\nreporting how they know arise from failure to understand the causal connection\nbetween information access and knowledge state, it remains unclear precisely what\ntheir difficulty comprises. We consider two possibilities and relate these to two\ncontrasting theoretical accounts: Source monitoring theory and fuzzy trace theory.\nFirst, children\u2019s difficulty answering \u201cHow do you know\u2026.?\u201d could be\nconfined to making the causal inference. O\u2019Neill & Gopnik (1991) seem to take this\nview: \u201c....Many 3-year-old children had difficulty identifying which experience led to\ntheir beliefs. \u2026 Presumably, they could remember them as events, since they had\ntaken place only moments before. However, many of the 3-year-olds failed to relate\nthese activities to the beliefs that they led to.\u201d (p 395). This view could readily be\naccommodated by source monitoring theory (Johnson, Hashtroudi & Lindsay, 1993)\naccording to which decision processes, whether automatic or deliberate, take place at\nthe time of remembering, resulting in an attribution of source. That is, there is a\nconceptual separation between the information encoded in memory, and the decision\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n5\nprocesses upon that information. This makes it possible for the theory to\naccommodate the case of recollection of relevant source information (what was\nexperienced) yet failure to make the appropriate source attribution (inferring the\nexperience as causally connected to the knowledge state). Johnson et al.\u2019s account\ndoes not take a developmental perspective and so they do not consider the case of an\nindividual who lacks understanding of a causal connection between information\naccess and consequent belief. In fact the account assumes that this underlying\nunderstanding is in place. What is important for our purposes is that there is an\nexplicit separation between memory of a knowledge-gaining episode, and the\nsubsequent inference based on that memory of the knowledge source. These authors\nstate, for example: \u201c\u2026..source monitoring depends not only on the quality of the\ninformation as encoded but also on the quality of the decision processes when source-\nmonitoring judgments are made\u2026.\u201d (Johnson et al., 1993, p.6 ) In principle it would\nbe possible therefore, within this account, to recollect the source, for example \u201cI saw\nit,\u201d without necessarily treating it as the source \u201cI know because I saw it.\u201d\nA second possibility is that children\u2019s difficulty answering \u201chow do you\nknow\u2026?\u201d arises from a broader failure to encode or remember the events that\nsurrounded the acquisition of knowledge. Perner and Ruffman (1995) make an\nargument along these lines: Because children do not understand the causal connection\nbetween information access and knowledge state, they fail to lay down episodic\nmemories of the relevant experiences. Similarly, the characterisation of children as\nsuffering from source amnesia (O\u2019Neill & Chong, 2001) seems to be consistent with\nthis second possibility. The broader deficit specified in this second possibility could\nbe accommodated by fuzzy trace theory (Brainerd & Reyna, 2004). This treats source\nnot as an inference but as an item in verbatim memory. Knowledge content can be\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n6\nretained in gist form once verbatim memory has decayed, leading to loss of source\ninformation. The important point for our purposes is that fuzzy trace theory leaves no\nroom for a distinction between recall of what happened (e.g. \u201cI saw it\u201d) and\ninterpreting this as the source of one\u2019s knowledge.\nTo summarize: The possibility of children remembering accurately what\nhappened during a knowledge-gaining episode, while failing to realise how their\nknowledge was acquired, follows readily from source monitoring theory, but is hard\nto accommodate within fuzzy trace theory. Fuzzy trace theory conflates source\nmemory (for example, \u201cI saw it\u201d) with treating the source as a source (\u201cI know\nbecause I saw it\u201d), while source monitoring theory specifies an inferential process\ndistinct from the laying down of memories of what happened. Given these different\nways of conceiving of source memory, it is of theoretical interest to find out whether\nchildren who fail to report how they know, can indeed, as O\u2019Neill and Gopnik (1991)\nassumed, recall the relevant events leading to knowledge acquisition. Note that\nalthough in the above discussion we have sometimes implied a simple dichotomy\nbetween being able to report the source of one\u2019s knowledge or not, we do not\nenvisage that children make a sudden leap from complete failure to understand, to\nadult-like understanding of the causal connection between information access and\nknowledge state. For experimental purposes it is often convenient to place children\ninto categories even if we assume an underlying continuum in development.\nChildren and adults clearly do make errors in reporting events which led up to\nknowledge acquisition under some circumstances. For example, in research on\nchildren\u2019s suggestibility and eye witness testimony, participants are typically asked to\nreport whether they saw or were told about an event, and of course it is the errors\nmade which are of interest in this research (for example research reported by Roberts\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n7\n& Blades, 2000). The complexity of events and the timescales involved are much\ngreater than in research on children\u2019s developing understanding about the mind, and\nso the fact that children commonly make errors of source recall in such research tells\nus little about the likely accuracy of immediate recall in simpler situations. In any\ncase, we do not know whether or not children would make the same errors if asked\n\u201cHow do you know\u2026?\u201d rather than, for example \u201cDid you see it\u2026?\u201d Interestingly, in\nthis literature reporting one\u2019s source and reporting it as a source are not differentiated.\nOne aim of the research reported here was to examine empirically this distinction:\nJust what, if anything, can children report about the sources of their knowledge\nwithout reporting them as sources?\nWe were particularly interested in children\u2019s realisation of when their\nknowledge was gained from another person\u2019s utterances. It can be important to realise\nwhen we gained knowledge indirectly via another person, rather than from our own\ndirect experience. For example, a person who wrongly assumed they had direct\nexperience of an event might give too much weight to their knowledge, and hold on to\nit in the face of subsequent contradicting information. This person might be overly\nconfident in passing on the knowledge to others, perpetuating what might be false\nrumour. She might provide inaccurate evidence in a legal setting in which she is\nrequired to report only direct experience (Principe & Ceci, 2002; Principe & Kanaya,\n2003; Principe, Kanaya, Ceci & Singh, 2006).\nSo far we have considered only verbally explicit reports about sources and the\nbases of knowledge. However, as Johnson et al. (1993) point out, much of our source\nmonitoring activity is automatic rather than deliberate. Children might reveal working\nunderstanding of the causal connection between information access and knowledge\nstate, even if they fail to report explicitly how they know something. In the research\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n8\nreported below, we investigated that possibility in order to characterise more precisely\njust what children\u2019s difficulty was in answering the explicit question \u201cHow do you\nknow\u2026.?\u201d\nIn all three experiments reported below the procedures were modifications of\none used previously (Whitcombe & Robinson, 2000; Robinson & Whitcombe, 2003).\nIn those studies, on each of a series of trials child and experimenter played a game to\nidentify which one of a pair of toys was hidden inside a tunnel, in an elaboration of\nO\u2019Neill, Astington and Flavell\u2019s (1992) procedure. Toys within the pair either felt the\nsame but looked different, or looked the same but felt different. On each trial one\nplayer felt the toy and the other saw it, so one had informative access and the other\ndid not. Both players said which toy they thought it was, the experimenter\u2019s\nsuggestion contradicting the child\u2019s. Then the child made the final judgment about the\ntoy\u2019s identity. When the chid had uninformative access she therefore had the\nopportunity to revise her judgment based on the well-informed experimenter\u2019s\nsuggestion. Children aged 3- and 4- years performed near ceiling at accepting the\nexperimenter\u2019s suggestion when she was the better informed, but rejecting it when she\nwas less well informed than the child. Importantly, when both players had\nuninformative access, children were less likely to accept the experimenter\u2019s\nsuggestion than when the experimenter was well-informed and the child was poorly\ninformed: Children did not believe the experimenter simply because they themselves\nwere unsure, but took into account the speaker\u2019s information access.\nIn the experiments reported below we assumed that children would show this\ncorrect pattern of gaining knowledge from their own direct experience when that was\ninformative, and gaining knowledge from the experimenter when he was well-\ninformed. We used these knowledge-gaining circumstances to examine what children\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n9\nunderstood, or could report, about their process of gaining knowledge. In all three\nexperiments children were asked the standard question used in theory of mind\nresearch to assess children\u2019s understanding of the source of their knowledge: \u201cHow do\nyou know it\u2019s (the hard one)?\u201d This assessed their verbally explicit understanding of\nthe causal connection between information access and knowledge state.\nImportantly, unlike the classic research cited above (e.g. Wimmer, Hogrefe &\nPerner, 1988; Gopnik & Graf, 1988) on each trial children experienced two potential\nknowledge sources. For example, they both saw the toy and were told which one the\nExperimenter, who had felt it, thought it was. Hence to answer the \u201cHow do you\nknow\u2026?\u201d question correctly, children had to realise which of those two potential\nsources they in fact relied on. In the procedure typically used, children experience\nonly a single source on each trial and so in principle could report correctly, for\nexample, \u201cI saw it\u201d without necessarily understanding \u201cI know because I saw it.\u201d\nIn Experiments 1 and 2 we examined the relation between (i) the accuracy of\nchildren\u2019s reporting of how they got to know which toy was in the tunnel, and (ii) the\naccuracy of their reports of the relevant surrounding events: Who looked and who felt\nin Experiment 1, and who had said the right thing and what the well-informed player\nhad said in Experiment 2.\nOne possibility was that performance on (i) and (ii) would be associated in\nthat children who could not report how they knew which toy was in the tunnel also\nfailed to report these events relevant to the knowing process. If so this would suggest\na problem of attention to sources either at input or at recall, associated with or as part\nof identification of sources as sources. Another possibility was that children might fail\nat (i) but succeed at (ii). If so, this would pin-point children\u2019s errors in answer to\n\u201cHow do you know\u2026?\u201d specifically to the causal inference.\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n10\nIn the final experiment, Experiment 3, in addition to asking children to report\nhow they knew the hidden toy\u2019s identity, we examined their working understanding of\nthe source of their knowledge. We gave children the opportunity to express\nuncertainty about their knowledge after the Experimenter doubted that he had seen or\nfelt the toy adequately. The Experimenter\u2019s expression of doubt about his access had\nimplications for the accuracy of the child\u2019s belief about the toy\u2019s identity when the\nchild had relied on the Experimenter\u2019s suggestion. In contrast it was irrelevant when\nthe child herself had had informative access (Robinson, Haigh & Nurmsoo, 2006).\nChildren who correctly realised when the Experimenter\u2019s doubt about his access had\nimplications for their own belief, revealed working understanding of the source of\ntheir knowledge. We were interested in the relationship between children\u2019s explicit\nreports of how they knew which toy was in the tunnel, and their working\nunderstanding.\nTaken together, the results of the three experiments would help us to\ncharacterise more precisely what children\u2019s difficulty is when they fail to report how\nthey know.\nExperiment 1\nWe began by comparing children\u2019s ability to report the source of their\nknowledge in answer to \u201cWho saw, who felt\u2026.\u201d, and their ability to report it as a\nsource in answer to \u201cHow do you know\u2026?\u201d As mentioned above, logically a child\nmight realise how she had experienced an object without inferring that that experience\nis causally related to her knowledge state. Such a distinction is readily accommodated\nby source monitoring theory, but not by fuzzy trace theory.\nMethod\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n11\nMaterials. We used a tunnel (150mm x 150mm x 350mm), open at both ends\nwith a viewing window (120mm x 120mm) cut into one side. The viewing window\nwas covered by transparent Perspex to prevent inquisitive fingers feeling inside and\nhad a curtain that could be drawn to obscure the view inside when necessary. Each\nend of the tunnel also had a curtain through which an arm could be placed to feel\ninside, but which prevented children from seeing inside. Eight pairs of toys were\nused, one pair for each of the 2 warm-up and 6 experimental trials. The toys within a\npair differed either in how they felt or in colour: Four pairs (stylised cats, lions,\nteddy bears and frogs) looked the same but one felt hard and the other soft; the other\n4 pairs (bears, ducks, cats and rabbits) felt the same but differed in colour. A mole\nglove puppet, called \u2018Mole\u2019, operated by the experimenter, was used to place the pairs\nof toys in a bag and then secretly place one of the pair into the tunnel. Mole also\nasked the identity questions.\nParticipants. We tested 37 children (15 boys and 22 girls; age range, 3;6 to 5;5\nmean = 4;7). Eighteen were from a nursery class: age range, 3;6 to 4;4 mean = 4;1.\nNineteen were from a reception class: age range, 4;4 to 5;5 mean = 4;11. All children\nattended schools serving mixed white and Asian, working and middle class catchment\nareas of Staffordshire, U.K, and had adequate command of English.\nDesign and procedure. On two warm-up trials, children were introduced to\nMole, the pairs of toys and their properties, and the tunnel, and practised looking at\nand feeling a toy placed inside the tunnel. The Experimenter told children that\nsometimes they would know which toy was inside the tunnel because they had seen or\nfelt it and sometimes they would know because he had told them.\nFour experimental trials followed. On two of these (direct trials) the child\ncould identity the hidden toy accurately from her own direct access, seeing on one\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n12\ntrial and feeling on the other, while the Experimenter had uninformative access. On\nthe other two experimental trials (tell trials) the child had uninformative access and\nthe Experimenter had informative access, again once through feeling and once\nthrough seeing. All possible orders of trial types were cycled across children. In\naddition, half the children received the \u201cHow do you know\u2026?\u201d question before the\nbeing asked to report each player\u2019s experience, and half received the other order.\nWhat follows is the procedure for a tell trial on which the Experimenter was\nwell informed by feeling inside the tunnel and the child was poorly informed by\nlooking.\n1. The child saw and felt both toys in a pair and agreed that they looked the same but\none was hard and one was soft. Both toys were placed in a bag, shaken up, and\nMole, operated by the experimenter, slipped one of them in secret into the tunnel.\n2. The Experimenter invited the child to look inside and said \u201cTell me which [frog]\nyou think it is\u201d. The child replied.\n3. The curtain was lowered over the viewing window and the experimenter felt\ninside saying \u201cI\u2019ll feel and tell you which [frog] I think it is.\u201d The Experimenter\ngave a suggestion that contradicted the child\u2019s, even if the child happened to guess\ncorrectly. Since children made no direct check at the end of the trial, any\ndeception was undetected. At this point we relied on the previous findings\nmentioned above, that children usually believe what they are told by a well-\ninformed Experimenter, and rely on their own experience when they are well-\ninformed.\n4. The Experimenter asked the know question: \u201cNow you know which toy is inside.\nHow do you know which one it is?\u201d with counterbalanced prompts if necessary\nsuch as \u201cDo you know because you saw it, or because I told you about it?\u201d\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n13\n5. For half the children the know question was followed by the experience questions,\nand the remaining children had the reverse order. The experience questions asked\nthem to report each player\u2019s direct experience: \u201cWho looked inside that time?\u201d\nand \u201cWho felt inside that time?\u201d (counterbalanced).\nThe procedure was similar with appropriate modifications on tell trials when the\nExperimenter was well informed by seeing, and on direct knowledge trials, when the\nchild was well informed by seeing or by feeling. When the Experimenter was poorly\ninformed he always gave the incorrect identity (by unobtrusively checking which toy\nwas placed inside the tunnel) so that the child would always contradict him on the\nbasis of her informative access. On all experimental trials the player with\nuninformative access went first. This was to avoid the circumstance of the\nExperimenter hearing a well-informed child\u2019s suggestion but then contradicting it on\nthe basis of uninformative access. Such irrational behaviour on the part of the\nExperimenter could call his trustworthiness into question or confuse the child as to the\npurpose of the game.\nResults and Discussion\nPreliminary analyses of order effects revealed no systematic differences or\ninteractions between order of questions and age, trial or question, so order was not\nconsidered further. We used a strict criterion for success at reporting experience:\nChildren had to report accurately both their own and the Experimenter\u2019s experience\non a particular trial to gain a score of 1. Children were given a score of 1 for each\ncorrect answer to the know question. Each child gained a score of 0, 1 or 2 for: (i)\nexperience reports on direct trials; (ii) experience reports on tell trials, (iii) know\nreports on direct; and (iv) know reports on tell trials. Mean scores appear in Table 1.\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n14\nA 2 x 2 x 2 ANOVA was carried out on the within-child variables of question\n(experience vs. know question) and trial type (direct vs. tell) and the between-child\nvariable of age (older vs. younger). The use of a more stringent rejection region of\n0.025 due to heterogeneity of variance did not affect any significant results.\nSignificant main effects of age, question and trial type were found: F (1, 35) = 22.42,\nMSe = 0.88, p < .001, F (1, 35) = 11.14, MSe = 0.55, p = .002 and F (1, 35) = 18.27,\nMSe = .49, p < .001 respectively. No other significant effects were found.\nThe main effect of age arose because older children performed better than\nyounger children. The main effect of question type arose because children were better\nat recalling who had looked and who had felt than they were at answering how they\nknew. The main effect of trial type arose because children were better on the direct\nknowledge trials than on the tell trials.\nIt is clear from these results that children performed better at reporting their\nown and the Experimenter\u2019s sources of knowledge than they did at reporting their\nsource as a source of knowledge. One possibility is that children simply failed to\nunderstand the know question, despite really understanding how they knew the toy\u2019s\nidentity. We can argue against this. Children\u2019s answers to the know question were\nmore accurate when the correct answer was \u201cI know because I saw it\u201d or \u201cI know\nbecause I felt it\u201d, than when the correct answer was \u201cI know because you told me.\u201d\nThis suggests that some children understood the know question, and also understood\nwhen their knowledge arose from seeing or feeling the hidden toy, without yet\nunderstanding when their knowledge came from the Experimenter. Hence the\ndifference between accuracy of answers to the know and experience questions on tell\ntrials at least cannot be explained in terms of failure to understand what the know\nquestion meant.\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n15\nA more likely possibility is that children could recollect how each person had\naccessed the hidden toy without yet being able to infer how they got to know the toy\u2019s\nidentity. This is in line with source monitoring theory, which treats source judgments\nas inferences. The finding cannot, however, be accommodated by fuzzy trace theory,\nwhich treats source information as directly encoded.\nFinally, we consider why children found it more difficult to report accurately\n\u201cI know because you told me\u201d than \u201cI know because I saw it\u201d or \u201cI know because I\nfelt it.\u201d Additional reasoning may be involved in attributing an utterance as a source,\ncompared with direct experience: The child may have to recollect what the speaker\nsaid as well as the speaker\u2019s information access and any other information relevant to\nthe speaker\u2019s reliability (Bright-Paul, personal communication, 2005). Another\npossibility is that some pre-school children consider only direct experiences to be\npotential sources. We already know that children who understand about seeing as a\nsource of knowledge may not understand about logical inference as a source. Children\nwho themselves make a correct inference about the content of a bag tend to deny that\nanother person who is in a position to make that same inference, will know what is in\nthe bag (Keenan, Ruffman & Olson, 1994; Sodian & Wimmer, 1987). Just as\nchildren apparently make inferences without understanding that they or others do so,\nchildren may gain knowledge about the world from utterances without understanding\nthat they are doing so.\nDirect sources may be relatively easy to understand because of the\nstraightforward relationship between mode of access and type of knowledge gained:\nSeeing almost always provides knowledge about colour whereas feeling never does;\nfeeling almost always provides knowledge about hardness whereas seeing often does\nnot. In contrast, no general rule can be learned about what kind of knowledge is to be\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n16\ngained from utterances, since utterances can provide knowledge about absolutely\nanything, but they can also be unreliable sources of knowledge about anything. It may\nbe the very power of utterances as sources of knowledge about the world, the range of\nknowledge that can be gained, that makes it difficult for children to come to\nunderstand that they are sources.\nExperiment 2\nHaving shown that children who failed to report their source as a source could\nnevertheless recall each player\u2019s experience, next we asked children to recall verbatim\nwhat was said by the well informed person and which player had said the right thing.\nWould we again find that children can report accurately the relevant events\nsurrounding their knowledge acquisition without making a causal inference about how\nthey knew?\nParticipants. Thirty children (13 girls) took part. Their age range was 3;6 to\n4;10, mean = 4;3). All children attended schools serving mixed white and Asian,\nworking and middle class catchment areas of Staffordshire, UK, and had adequate\ncommand of English.\nProcedure. The procedure was the same as in Experiment 1, except that the\nexperience questions were replaced by tell questions: \u201cWho said the right thing that\ntime?\u201d with a counterbalanced prompt of \u201cYou\u201d or \u201cMe\u201d when needed. Children were\nthen asked what was said by the player who had been well informed, for example\n\u201cWhat did I say was inside that time?\u201d The tell questions were always asked in this\norder, which made the better sense in practice.\nResults and Discussion\nTo gain credit for correct answers to the tell questions on a particular trial the\nchild had to answer both questions correctly (Who said the right thing? What did the\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n17\nwell informed person say?). Mean scores out of 4 for the know and tell questions\nwere 1.63 (1.40) and 3.07 (1.11) respectively: t (29) = 6.74, p < .001. That is, children\nfound it easier to answer the tell questions than the know question. As in Experiment\n1, order of test questions had no effect. Some children who correctly recalled that the\nexperimenter had said the right thing, and reported what he had said, then apparently\nfailed to infer \"I know which one it is because you told me.\"\nResults of the first two experiments suggest that children may have available\nall the information that would be sufficient for an adult to infer correctly that their\nsource of knowledge was an utterance, and yet still fail to answer the know question\ncorrectly.\nExperiment 3\nGiven children\u2019s ability to access the information necessary for inferring how\nthey knew which toy was in the tunnel, in Experiment 3 we investigated whether\nchildren revealed working understanding of the causal connection between\ninformation access and knowledge state, even if they could not make a verbally\nexplicit report. We again asked children to report explicitly how they knew the hidden\ntoy\u2019s identity in a version of the tunnel game used in Experiments 1 and 2, but this\ntime we compared accuracy of children\u2019s answers with their working understanding\nof the source of their knowledge. We assessed this with a procedure devised by\nRobinson, Haigh and Nurmsoo (2006), to find out whether or not children reasoned\nalong the lines of: \u201cI believed what you told me because I thought you were well-\ninformed. If after all you were not well-informed then my belief could be false.\u201d\nChildren found out whether the hard or soft toy was in the tunnel, either by feeling it\nthemselves, or by accepting the suggestion from the Experimenter who had felt it.\nAfter children had announced which toy was in the tunnel, the Experimenter\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n18\nexpressed doubt that he had felt the toy properly. The child was then asked whether it\ncould be the other toy of the pair. Children who understood how they got to know the\ntoy\u2019s identity, should accept that it could be the other toy when they had relied on the\nExperimenter\u2019s suggestion, but deny that it could be when they had themselves felt\nthe toy.\nRobinson et al. (2006) found that children aged 3- to 4- years showed that\npattern of responses. For example in Robinson et al. (2006) Experiment 4, 81 % said\n\u201cNo\u201d it could not be the other toy on both of two trials following the speaker\u2019s doubt\nabout his access when they had themselves had informative access, whereas only 40%\nsaid \u201cNo\u201d on both of two trials when they had relied on the speaker\u2019s suggestion, and\nthe remainder accepted at least once that it could be the other toy. Children responded\nno differently whether it was a puppet, rather than the Experimenter, who felt the toy\nin the tunnel and expressed doubt about his access: Children attended to the speaker\nrole rather than to the Experimenter as an individual. Importantly, on trials when\nchildren had relied on the Experimenter\u2019s suggestion, they were less likely to accept\nthat it could be the other toy in the tunnel when a puppet observer expressed doubt\nabout the hidden toy\u2019s identity without giving any reason, than when the\nExperimenter expressed doubts about his access. Even though the puppet observer\nsaid explicitly, for example \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the [hard cat],\u201d children were less likely\nto accept that it could be the soft cat than when the Experimenter said \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\nfelt properly.\u201d\nImportantly, this was the case only when children had in fact relied on the\nExperimenter as their knowledge source. When children had found out the toy\u2019s\nidentity by their own direct access, they were no more likely to accept that it could be\nthe other toy when the Experimenter doubted his access than when the puppet\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n19\ndoubted the toy\u2019s identity. This pattern of data cannot be explained simply in terms of\na greater inclination to answer \u201cYes\u201d to \u201cCould it be the other toy?\u201d when the\nExperimenter rather than a puppet asked the question (even though it was the puppet\nrather than the Experimenter who said \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s [the hard cat]\u201d and the\nExperimenter made no direct comment on the toys identity). Rather, children\u2019s\nresponses took into account the source of their knowledge. In any case, the fact that\nnearly all children responded \u201cNo\u201d rather than \u201cYes\u201d to the Experimenter\u2019s question\n\u201cCould it be the [other toy]?\u201d when they had informative direct access themselves,\nsuggests that any authority they saw in the Experimenter did not lead to them\nunthinkingly to say \u201cYes.\u201d\nIn Experiment 3, we were interested in the relationship between children\u2019s\nexplicit judgments of how they knew which toy was in the tunnel, and their responses\nto the Experimenter\u2019s doubt about his access when they had relied on his suggestion\nabout the toy\u2019s identity. One possibility was that only children who could report that\nthe Experimenter had told them which toy was in the tunnel, would realise the\nspecific implications of having believed a speaker who was not as well-informed as\nhe had originally seemed. On the other hand, the correct reporting in Experiments 1\nand 2 of the Experimenter\u2019s experience and of what he said raise the possibility that\nchildren would be able to make use of that information to work out the implications of\nthe Experimenter\u2019s doubt about his access.\nMethod\nParticipants. The sample comprised 59 children, (35 girls) 33 from nursery\nclasses (age range 3y; 7m to 4y; 7m, mean = 4y; 1m) and 26 from reception classes in\ntheir first year of formal schooling (age range 4y; 7m to 5y; 6m, mean = 5y; 0m). All\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n20\nchildren attended schools serving mixed white and Asian, working and middle class\ncatchment areas of northern UK and had adequate command of English.\nMaterials. Toys, tunnel and puppet Mole were used as in Experiments 1 and 2.\nFour pairs of toys were either soft or hard but looked the same and 4 pairs were\ndifferent colours but felt the same.\nProcedure. Children began with two warm-up trials on which they practised\nseeing and feeling toys inside the tunnel, and being told about the hidden toy by the\nExperimenter. They received explicit feedback about how they knew the toy\u2019s\nidentity. Six subsequent experimental trials were cycled in counterbalanced order so\nthat each trial type appeared in each position in the sequence. Children received 4\ntrials on which they were asked the know question as in Experiments 1 and 2 (e.g.\n\u201cHow did you know it was the hard frog?\u201d with prompts if necessary). On two of\nthese trials they could identify the toy from their own direct experience, seeing on one\nand feeling on the other (direct trials). On the other two trials they had uninformative\naccess and could rely on the well-informed Experimenter\u2019s suggestion, once when he\nhad seen and once when he had felt the hidden toy (tell trials). The trials on which\nchildren had informative access to the toy served to give children turns at being well-\ninformed, to demonstrate that the Experimenter was wrong when poorly informed,\nand to ensure that the correct answer to the know question was not always \u201cBecause\nyou told me.\u201d\nTwo further trials followed a slightly modified procedure. Half the children\nentered the Experimenter doubt condition. The procedure on these trials is detailed\nbelow. Stages 1 to 4 served only to lead children to gain knowledge either directly or\nfrom the Experimenter. The novel part of the procedure is at stage (v):\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n21\n1. The child was introduced to a pair of toys and agreed on their properties.\nBoth toys were placed in the bag, shaken, and one toy was slipped from the bag into\nthe tunnel.\n2. The Experimenter either looked or felt the toy in the tunnel, saying \u201cNow\nI\u2019m going to look \/ feel inside and tell you which toy I think is inside.\u201d He then\nidentified the toy correctly, for example \u201cThe soft cat.\u201d\n3. The child was then invited to look at (when the Experimenter had felt) or\nfeel (when the Experimenter had looked at) the toy inside the tunnel.\n4. The puppet Mole then asked the child an identity question, \u201cWhich one is\ninside please?\u201d Since the child had uninformative access, she could answer the\nidentity question correctly by relying on the well-informed Experimenter\u2019s\nsuggestion. If the child\u2019s identity judgment on a tell trial was not in line with the\nExperimenter\u2019s suggestion but instead referred to the other toy, the trial was\nterminated. When the child repeated the Experimenter\u2019s suggestion the trial\ncontinued:\n5. The Experimenter doubted the reliability of his access, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not sure\nI looked \/ felt inside properly\u201d followed by the doubt question: \u201cCould it be the [other\ntoy]?\u201d\n6. After the child\u2019s response, the Child and Experimenter removed the toy\nfrom the tunnel to check its identity.\nThe other half of the children, allocated alternatively, entered the Mole doubt\ncondition. The procedure was the same as for those in the Experimenter doubt\ncondition, except at stage (v) of the procedure. Instead of the Experimenter doubting\nhis access, the puppet Mole said \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the [soft cat]\u201d, followed by the\ndoubt question.\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n22\nResults and Discussion\nSince we were interested only in children who had acquired knowledge from\nan apparently well-informed speaker, all children who entered the analyses had\nanswered the identity question at stage 4 in line with the Experimenters\u2019 suggestion.\nChildren received a score of 0, 1 or 2 for the number of correct responses to the know\nquestion on tell trials, and similarly on direct trials. As in Experiment 1, the mean\nscore (sd) was lower on tell trials, when the correct answer was \u201cI know because you\ntold me\u201d than on direct trials, when the correct answer was \u201cI know because I saw it\u201d\nor \u201c\u2026 because I felt it\u201d: 1.19 (.900) and 1.61 (.743) respectively, t (df = 58) = 3.64, p\n< .001. Again, this suggests that children who failed the know question did not just\nfail to understand what the question meant.\nChildren also received a score out of 2 for the number of \u201cNo\u201d responses to\nthe doubt question. We were primarily interested in the relationship between\nchildren\u2019s responses to the know question on tell trials (whether they reported that\nthey knew because the Experimenter had told them), and their responses to the doubt\nquestions in the Experimenter and Mole doubt conditions (whether they more\nfrequently accepted that it could be the other toy when the speaker doubted his access\nthan when an observer doubted the toy\u2019s identity without giving a reason). These\nresults appear in Table 2. We subjected children\u2019s responses to the doubt question to\na 3 x 2 x 2 between-group ANOVA, with the variables source scores on tell trials\n(0,1,2), age group (nursery, 3 - 4 years vs. reception, 4 - 5 years) and condition (Mole\nvs Experimenter\u2019s doubt). There was a between-child main effect for condition only:\nF (1, N = 59) = 8.88, p = .005. Children responded with \u201cNo\u201d (it couldn\u2019t be the\nother toy) significantly more often in the Mole doubt condition (mean 1.27) than in\nthan the Experimenter doubt condition (mean .45). Importantly, there was no sign of\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n23\nan interaction between condition and scores on the source question. Children who\nfailed the source question showed no less discrimination between Mole and the\nExperimenter\u2019s expression of doubt than did children who explicitly understood that\nthe Experimenter was their source of knowledge.\nOur interpretation of these results relies on the previous finding (Robinson,\nHaigh & Nurmsoo, 2006), explained above, that children treated the Experimenter\nand a puppet no differently when either was the speaker who expressed doubt about\nhis access. Given this finding, we can argue that children\u2019s differential responses in\nthe Experimenter and Mole doubt conditions in Experiment 3 reflect their sensitivity\nto the specific implications of the speaker\u2019s doubt about his access, for example \u201cI\u2019m\nnot sure I felt properly.\u201d Children were more inclined to accept that it could be the\nother toy in the Experimenter doubt condition despite the fact that the Experimenter\nexpressed no doubt about the toy\u2019s identity, whereas Mole did express such doubt in\nthe Mole doubt condition, saying for example \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the [soft cat].\u201d\nChildren who did not report explicitly \u201cI know because you told me\u201d nevertheless\nbehaved as if they reasoned along the lines of : \u201cI believed what you told me because\nI thought you were well-informed. If after all you were not well-informed then my\nbelief could be false.\u201d That is, they exhibited working understanding of the source of\ntheir knowledge.\nGeneral Discussion and Conclusions\nIn the research presented here we aimed to clarify what underlies children\u2019s\nerrors in answer to the classic question \u201cHow do you know\u2026.?\u201d Errors cannot be\ndismissed as simply due to failure to understand the question. As mentioned in the\nintroduction, children find it difficult not only to report how they got to know\nsomething. They also fail completely different questions such as what access they\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n24\nneed in order to find out something. In addition, in Experiments 1 and 3 children who\nanswered correctly when seeing or feeling was their source, found the question more\ndifficult when they knew because the Experimenter had told them. In the discussion\nof Experiment 1 we speculated on reasons for this difference in difficulty, but the\nimportant point here is that children could understand the know question, without\nknowing the answer when it was \u201cI know because you told me.\u201d\nYet children did not appear to suffer from a deep-seated source amnesia or\nfailure to encode source information: In Experiment 1, children who performed poorly\nin answering \u201cHow do you know\u2026?\u201d reported more accurately which player felt and\nwhich saw the hidden toy. In Experiment 2, they reported more accurately which\nplayer said the right thing and what the well-informed player had said. Children\ncould, therefore, report the source of their knowledge, yet fail to report it as the\nsource. The conceptual distinction between reporting (what to an adult is) the source\nof knowledge, and reporting it as the source, has been largely ignored, yet the\nempirical finding of a difference in difficulty has potentially important implications\nfor our understanding of children\u2019s developing conceptions of the process of\nknowledge acquisition. We consider two such implications:\nFirst, the difference in difficulty between reporting accurately, for example\n\u201cYou felt the toy\u201d and \u201cYou said it was the soft cat\u201d on the one hand, and reporting\naccurately \u201cI know it\u2019s the soft cat because you told me,\u201d is easier to accommodate\nwithin source monitoring theory (Johnson, Hashtroudi & Lindsay, 1993), than within\nfuzzy trace theory (e.g. Brainerd & Reyna, 2004). Source monitoring theory treats\nsource judgments as inferences on the basis of recollected experiences. Hence the\ncorrect reports of who saw, who felt, what the well-informed person said, could for an\nolder child or adult, form the basis of an inference about the source of knowledge, but\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n25\nsuch an inference might not be made for various reasons. In particular, it might not be\nmade by a child who simply did not understand the causal connection between the\nexperiences and the knowledge state. Fuzzy trace theory, in contrast, treats source\ninformation as encoded directly and makes no distinction between recollecting \u201cI saw\nit\u201d and reporting \u201cI know because I saw it\u201d. For young children the two clearly are\nnot equivalent.\nSecond, the difference in difficulty between reporting experiences and\nanswering the know question also has implications for research on eye witness\ntestimony and suggestibility. As mentioned in the introduction, researchers in those\nareas often conflate recollection of source with understanding it as a source: They\ntreat answers to questions such as \u201cDid you see it?\u201d as equivalent to \u201cHow do you\nknow\u2026?\u201d It has been argued that children gain some protection against misleading\nor suggestive questioning such as \u201cHe was wearing a red cap wasn\u2019t he?\u201d once they\nunderstand more about the knowing process and come to treat beliefs as\nrepresentations which can be in mismatch with reality (Welch-Ross, 2000). To test for\nsuch effects it is important to measure children\u2019s causal understanding of the knowing\nprocess, as Welch-Ross (2000) did, rather than just recall of experiences. One\ninteresting further question to arise from this line of research is whether any such\nprotective effect is afforded by working understanding about sources, rather than or in\naddition to verbally explicit understanding. On the other hand, in much of the research\non suggestibility children are unaware of the experience history of the person who\noffers the misleading suggestion, and so knowledge of the knowing process, whether\nimplicit or explicit, might not be particularly helpful.\nIn Experiment 3, we found that children who failed to report explicitly \u201cI\nknow because you told me\u201d performed no differently from those who answered\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n26\ncorrectly, at seeing the implications of the speaker\u2019s doubt about the adequacy of his\ninformation access. Whether or not they could say how they got to know which toy\nwas in the tunnel, children realised that if the speaker had not felt the toy properly,\nand they had relied on his suggestion, then their belief could be false. These children\nbehaved as if they understood the causal connection between their own knowledge\nand the Experimenter\u2019s suggestion about the toy\u2019s identity.\nChildren spontaneously drew implications from the speaker\u2019s doubt about his\naccess without being explicitly prompted to reflect on how they knew the hidden toy\u2019s\nidentity, as they were with the question \u201cHow do you know\u2026?\u201d We know little about\nhow often pre-school children spontaneously engage in reflection on how they know,\nor how often they are prompted to engage in such reflection when challenged by\npeers\u2019 or adults\u2019 questions. Bartsch, Horvath and Estes (2003) examined the\nCHILDES data-base for examples of talk about learning or teaching in the everyday\nspeech of 5 children. They found that comments on the source of factual knowledge\nwere rare both in the children\u2019s talk and in adults\u2019 talk to the children. If explicit\nreflection on sources of knowledge occurs rather rarely in these early years, children\u2019s\nworking understanding about the knowing process may be more important than their\nrelative weakness at reflecting on how they know. Future research may tell us. From\nthe present research we know that for recently acquired knowledge, children\u2019s\ninaccurate explicit reports of how they know do not necessarily indicate deep-seated\nsource amnesia, failure to encode or recall the events surrounding knowledge\nacquisition, or even failure to understand the causal connection between such events\nand their resulting knowledge state.\nKnowing about sources of knowledge\n27\nReferences\nBartsch, K., Horvath, K,. & Estes, D.
