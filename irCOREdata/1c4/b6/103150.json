Introduction\nCoherent vortices are an important feature of fluid flows at high Reynolds number,\nparticularly in two dimensions, where many flows are dominated by the dynamics and\ninteractions of these long-lived structures (Fornberg 1977; McWilliams 1984; Benzi et al.\n1986; Brachet et al. 1988). Understanding the stability and dynamics of such vortices\nis particularly important for atmospheric applications (for example, Guinn & Schubert\n1993, Smith & Montgomery 1995, Montgomery & Kallenbach 1997). Many studies have\nconsidered the behaviour of an axisymmetric vortex subjected to a non-axisymmetric\ndisturbance, which could be weak or strong. Early on, an important process of axisym-\nmetrization was identified: a vortex may evolve dynamically to an axisymmetric state as\nthe non-axisymmetric components of the vorticity distribution become every more finely-\nscaled through spiral wind-up in the underlying flow field (Melander et al. 1987). Since\nthis spiral wind-up process does not lead to these components tending to zero point-wise\n(except on long, viscous time-scales), a more convenient definition of axisymmetrization\nis to say that the non-axisymmetric components of the stream function \u03c8, that is angular\nFourier modes \u03c8keik\u03b8 with k 6= 0, tend to zero at large times. In particular the far-field\nflow becomes axisymmetric as time t\u2192\u221e.\nIt was soon realised that this axisymmetrization process only occurs for sufficiently\nweak disturbances, and that above a certain amplitude threshold, long-lived nonlinear\n2 M. R. Turner and Andrew D. Gilbert\nrotating states can be formed (Dritschel 1989, 1998; Koumoutsakos 1997; Rossi et al.\n1997). These can take the form of multipoles; for example the addition of a pure azimuthal\nwave number m = 2 vorticity distribution can cause the vortex to evolve into a tripole\nconsisting of a vortex core and two opposite-signed satellite vortices (Rossi et al. 1997;\nBarba & Leonard 2007). Another possibility is to take a stable axisymmetric vortex and\nexpose it to an external irrotational strain field, another m = 2 disturbance. If the strain\nis weak, then linear theory applies and all perturbations axisymmetrize (Briggs et al.\n1970; Bassom & Gilbert 1998; Le Dize`s 2000). However for higher values, the vorticity\ncan evolve into a pair of cat\u2019s eyes rotating about the coherent vortex core (Schecter et al.\n2000; Balmforth et al. 2001; Macaskill et al. 2002). Within the cat\u2019s eyes the vorticity,\nwhich has the same sign as the core, becomes wound up and homogenized.\nIn the present paper we consider the evolution of a stable axisymmetric vortex, for\nexample a Gaussian vortex, exposed to an external irrotational strain field \u03c8ext, which\ncould model the effect of other vortices in a flow, or the motion of distant boundaries.\nThe important feature is that no vorticity is introduced into the flow by \u03c8ext, and so\nany evolution consists of rearranging the vorticity in the original profile into a new\nstate, axisymmetric or otherwise (insofar as viscosity may be neglected). Our aim is to\ndetermine the threshold for the formation of cat\u2019s eyes as a function of the strength and\nduration of the external strain field, and to compare with the studies of Le Dize`s (2000)\nand Balmforth et al. (2001), which are based on asymptotic models. When the external\nstrain is at a level below the threshold for the formation of cat\u2019s eyes, we determine the\ndecay rate and how it links to the profile of the vortex: we find that as the threshold is\napproached, the speed of decay is reduced, and this is linked to the change in the mean,\naxisymmetric profile caused by nonlinear effects, as suggested by Schecter et al. (2000)\nand Balmforth et al. (2001).\nWe are also concerned with possible values of the radius r at which cat\u2019s eyes may\nform within a coherent vortex. To this end we impose a rotating external strain field\none of whose parameters is its angular velocity \u03b1ext. If we imagine a purely kinematic\nsituation in which this strain is simply added to an axisymmetric flow field with angular\nvelocity \u03b10(r), then there is a key radius rext for which \u03b10(rext) = \u03b1ext. At this radius\nthe fluid particles co-rotate with the external strain, and resonant recirculating regions,\ncat\u2019s eyes, form. These rotate at an angular velocity \u03b1ext, with the external strain. In a\nproperly dynamical simulation with an initial angular velocity \u03b10(r) the picture is more\ncomplicated, as the advected vorticity then affects the flow field, but the issue arises: if\na transient external strain field is imposed with angular velocity \u03b1ext, can cat\u2019s eyes be\ngenerated at a radius rext that then persist at late times when the external forcing is\nnegligible? If not, where do they form?\nTo understand some of the dynamical aspects, we need to introduce the concept of\na \u2018quasi-mode\u2019. In the limit of a weak m = 2 disturbance to a Gaussian vortex, as the\nvortex axisymmetrizes, the far-field streamfunction shows an initial phase of exponential\ndamping with decay rate \u03b3qm < 0 and angular velocity \u03b1qm. This behaviour is termed\na quasi-mode (Briggs et al. 1970; Schecter et al. 2000; Balmforth et al. 2001) and has\nbeen observed numerically (Bassom & Gilbert 1998) and in experiments (Schecter et al.\n2000). The dynamics of these quasi-modes is discussed in more detail in \u00a73.1, but for\nnow we may consider the dynamics of a Gaussian vortex as possessing a natural damped\nmode, with angular velocity \u03b1qm. In our simulations we vary \u03b1ext to understand how the\nangular velocity of the external forcing interacts with the angular velocity of this natural\nquasi-mode, and whether generally we form persistent cat\u2019s eyes at the radius rext linked\nto the forcing, or at rqm linked to the quasi-mode, or somewhere else. The outcome is\nLinear and nonlinear decay of cat\u2019s eyes in two-dimensional vortices 3\nnot obvious, as above the threshold needed to generate cat\u2019s eyes, nonlinearity will also\nchange the mean profiles of the vorticity and angular velocity.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. In \u00a72, we formulate the problem, and present\ndiagnostics for our simulations. Section 3 gives numerical results for the Gaussian vortex\nwhen the external strain has the same angular velocity as the quasi-mode. We observe\nthat persistent cat\u2019s eyes form for sufficiently strong external strain fields, and map out\nthe threshold for their formation. Section 4 is concerned with computing the angular ve-\nlocity \u03b1qm and decay rate \u03b3qm for a quasi-mode on a general vortex profile, by isolating\na Landau pole numerically (Schecter et al. 2000). In section 5 we vary the angular veloc-\nity of the external strain field and determine where cat\u2019s eyes form, and their rotation\nfrequency. Again our results may be understood by determining Landau poles for the\nresulting mean profiles. Our concluding remarks are found in \u00a76.\n2. Formulation\nA two-dimensional vortex with vorticity \u03c9 and stream function \u03c8 in an irrotational,\nexternally imposed flow with stream function \u03c8ext is governed by the dimensionless vor-\nticity equation\n\u2202t\u03c9 \u2212 J(\u03c8 + \u03c8ext, \u03c9) = R\u22121\u22072\u03c9, \u22072\u03c8 = \u2212\u03c9, \u22072\u03c8ext = 0, (2.1)\nwhere in polar coordinates J(a, b) \u2261 r\u22121(\u2202ra \u2202\u03b8b\u2212\u2202\u03b8a \u2202rb) and the velocity field is given\nby ( 1r\u03c8\u03b8,\u2212\u03c8r). The stream function \u03c8 is permitted to grow no faster than ln r for large\nr, whereas \u03c8ext, as a harmonic function, increases in powers of r. We are interested\nin the inviscid limit of large Reynolds number R. There are many processes that can\noccur on time and space scales linked to powers of R, for example the destruction of fine\nscales of vorticity within the vortex core, or within individual cat\u2019s eyes, on the shear-\ndiffuse time scale of O(R1\/3) (see Moffatt & Kamkar 1983, Rhines & Young 1983, Bernoff\n& Lingevitch 1994, Bajer et al. 2001). However, unless we mention otherwise, with the\ndiagnostics we use the results presented are essentially inviscid, taken at sufficiently large\nR that they do not show appreciable sensitivity to changes in the value of R, for example\nfrom 107 to 106.\nWe start with an axisymmetric vortex \u03c9 = \u21260(r), \u03c8 = \u03a80(r) at t = 0, usually the\nGaussian vortex defined by\n\u21260(r) = (4pi)\u22121 e\u2212r\n2\/4. (2.2)\nThis vortex has angular velocity given by\n\u03b10(r) = \u2212 1\nr\n\u2202\u03a80\n\u2202r\n=\n1\nr2\n\u222b r\n0\ns\u21260(s) ds =\n1\n2pir2\n(\n1\u2212 e\u2212r2\/4\n)\n. (2.3)\nThe structure of the Gaussian vortex in (2.2) is not always typical: vortices observed, in\ntwo-dimensional turbulence for example, often have sharp edges arising from processes\nsuch as vortex stripping (Legras & Dritschel 1993). We therefore also consider members\nof a family of tanh vortices used by Hall et al. (2003), with vorticity distribution\n\u21260(r) =\n1\n4pi\n1\u2212 tanh[(r2 \u2212 \u03c32)\/4(1\u2212 \u03c3)]\n1 + tanh[\u03c32\/4(1\u2212 \u03c3)] , (2.4)\nand angular velocity\n\u03b10(r) =\n1\n4pir2(1 + tanh[\u03c32\/4(1\u2212 \u03c3)])\n[\nr2\n2\n\u2212 2(1\u2212 \u03c3) ln\n(\ncosh[(r2 \u2212 \u03c32)\/4(1\u2212 \u03c3)]\ncosh[\u03c32\/4(1\u2212 \u03c3)]\n)]\n.\n(2.5)\n4 M.

From right to left, the Gaussian vortex (2.2) and the tanh vortex (2.4) for\n\u03c3 = 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9.\nThe members of this family vary from a broad vortex to a top hat or Rankine vortex as\n\u03c3 varies from 0 to 1. A plot of (2.4) for \u03c3 = 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9, along with the Gaussian\nvortex (2.2) can be seen in figure 1.\nStarting with one of the initial conditions (2.2) or (2.4), an external flow \u03c8ext with\nazimuthal wavenumber m 6= 0 is switched on for t > 0 and forces the vortex into a non-\naxisymmetric state. We will always take m = 2, in what follows; however we will often\nleave the quantity m in our equations to show their mathematical structure. The case\nm = 1 is a pure translation mode, giving no dynamical effects and so of no interest here,\nwhile we expect similar results would be obtained for any value of m \u2265 2. Furthermore\nin a multipole expansion of a general external irrotational flow, m = 2 would be the\ndominant term giving dynamical effects internal to the vortex.\nThe subsequent evolution of \u03c9 and \u03c8 is then followed by time-stepping (2.1) with the\nsolution written as a (truncated) sum of Fourier harmonics\n\u03c9(r, \u03b8, t) =\n\u221e\u2211\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\u03c9k(r, t)eik\u03b8, \u03c8(r, \u03b8, t) =\n\u221e\u2211\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\u03c8k(r, t)eik\u03b8. (2.6)\nFor m = 2 the external, irrotational stream function \u03c8ext is pure strain, taking the form,\n\u03c8ext(r, \u03b8, t) = \u03c6(t)rmeim\u03b8 + c.c.. (2.7)\nThe complex function \u03c6(t) determines the time-dependent strength and orientation of\nthe strain field and we consider a form given by three parameters (A, T, \u03b1ext),\n\u03c6(t) = (At\/T )e\u2212t\n2\/2T 2e\u2212im\u03b1extt. (2.8)\nThe variable A denotes the amplitude of the forcing, T denotes some large turn off time,\nand \u03b1ext is the angular velocity of the forcing. This forcing is similar to that used by\nBalmforth et al. (2001), although our definitions of A and T are not directly comparable\nwith theirs. Note that the external strain fields we impose are not strong enough for\nthe process of vortex stripping to occur (Legras & Dritschel 1993); in the vicinity of\nLinear and nonlinear decay of cat\u2019s eyes in two-dimensional vortices 5\nthe vortex, our flows are always dominated by the rotational component of the flow,\ngenerated by the vortex.\nIn order to measure the strength of the disturbance to the vortex, we define the mth\nmultipole moment of the vorticity by\nQm(t) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nrm+1\u03c9m(r, t) dr (m \u2265 1). (2.9)\nThe measure Qm(t) is related to the far-field form of the stream function, with\n2m\u03c8m(r, t)Qm(t)r\u2212m (r \u2192\u221e) (2.10)\n(see, e.g., Bassom & Gilbert 1998).\nAnother useful measure of an m = 2 disturbance to a vortex is the instantaneous\naspect ratio (major to minor axes) of the approximately elliptical streamlines at the\norigin (Balmforth et al. 2001). Working in a frame that co-rotates with the external\nstrain, the stream function at the origin takes the approximate form\n\u03c8co(r, \u03b8, t) ' const.+ r2(a+ \u03b1ext) + br2e2i\u03b8 + c.c.+O(r3), (2.11)\nwhich may be written in rotated Cartesian coordinates (x\u2032, y\u2032) as\n\u03c8co(r, \u03b8, t) = const.+ (a+ \u03b1ext + 2|b|)x\u20322 + (a+ \u03b1ext \u2212 2|b|)y\u20322 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\nWe now use the fact that\na = lim\nr\u21920\n1\n2r\n\u22121\u2202r\u03c80(r, t), b = lim\nr\u21920\nr\u22122\u03c82(r, t),\nto obtain the aspect ratio for near-circular stream lines (b small) in the form\n\u03bd(t) = lim\nr\u21920\nr|\u2202r\u03c80(r, t) + 2\u03b1extr|+ 2|\u03c82(r, t)|\nr|\u2202r\u03c80(r, t) + 2\u03b1extr| \u2212 2|\u03c82(r, t)| . (2.12)\nNote that as r \u2192 0, there is no singularity in (2.12), but when calculating \u03bd numeri-\ncally, we encounter inaccuracy close to the origin. Therefore we extrapolate to the origin\nthrough the relatively flat part of the curve, which minimises this problem.\nWe choose to measure this aspect ratio in a frame of reference rotating with the\nexternal strain, although other choices could be made. For example a frame co-rotating\nwith the phase of Q2(t) or a non-rotating frame produce qualitatively similar results. We\ncould avoid the necessity of choosing a rotating frame by using the contours of constant\nvorticity, rather than stream function, to calculate \u03bd(t), however we found that the fine\nscale structure in the vorticity made this procedure impractical. Both Q2(t) and \u03bd(t) give\nuseful measures of the non-axisymmetric m = 2 structure on the vortex, and indicate\nwhether the vortex is relaxing to an axisymmetric configuration (signalled by Q2 \u2192 0\nand \u03bd \u2192 1), or retaining persistent cat\u2019s eyes.\n3. Numerical results: threshold for cat\u2019s eye formation\nIn this section we present results of fully nonlinear simulations of (2.1) for the evolu-\ntion of the Gaussian vortex (2.2). The external forcing is determined by the parameters\n(A, T, \u03b1ext). The imposed angular velocity of the strain field \u03b1ext is a key parameter in\nour study. We also recall that given an initial angular velocity profile \u03b10(r) it is at the\nradius rext given by \u03b10(rext) = \u03b1ext, where particles rotate in concert with the external\nstrain field, that the external field has a strong effect, at least initially before nonlinear\neffects take hold.\n6 M. R. Turner and Andrew D. Gilbert\n3.1. Quasi-mode properties\nThe other key angular velocity in the system is that of the quasi-mode, \u03b1qm; we now pause\nto outline some of the properties of this mode. As discussed in the introduction, following\na weak, instantaneous external strain of a Gaussian vortex, there is an exponential decay\nof fluctuations at a rate \u03b3qm, as measured by the moment Qm(t) with m = 2. Also Qm(t)\nhas a frequency \u2212m\u03b1qm corresponding to an angular velocity \u03b1qm. This exponential\nbehaviour is suggestive of a normal mode, but it can be shown that these cannot exist\non a Gaussian vortex, and what is seen is really a cooperative effect of the continuous\nspectrum (Briggs et al. 1970). The resulting quasi-mode can be thought of informally as\na normal mode that is modified by the fine-scaling of vorticity at a critical radius, rqm\n(Balmforth et al. 2001). Together with this exponential decay of Qm is also a transfer of\nenstrophy from fluctuations to the mean profile (Bassom & Gilbert 1999).\nWe combine the decay rate and the angular velocity to give the dependence Qm(t) \u221d\ne\u2212ipqmt where the complex growth rate \u2212ipqm = \u03b3qm \u2212 im\u03b1qm can be calculated by\nanalytic continuation (see \u00a74) and emerges from the continuous spectrum as a Landau\npole. Schecter et al. (2000) compute this numerically for a Gaussian vortex with m = 2\nto obtain, rescaled in line with our conventions below,\n\u2212ipqm \u2261 \u03b3qm \u2212 im\u03b1qm ' (4pi)\u22121(\u22120.079\u2212 0.222i), (3.1)\n\u03b3qm ' \u22120.0063, \u03b1qm ' 0.0089. (3.2)\n(Note that Schecter et al. (2000) in fact obtain a slightly different value \u03b1qm = 0.0090 as\nthey work in a bounded domain with constant \u03c8 imposed at the radius r0 = 10 in our\nunits, rather than the infinite domain we use in \u00a74.)\nThe quasi-mode angular velocity \u03b1qm also singles out the critical radius rqm, where\nfluid particles co-rotate, given by\n\u03b10(rqm) = \u03b1qm, rqm ' 4.22. (3.3)\nThe complex growth rate \u2212ipqm of the quasi-mode, and so of weak disturbances to a\nvortex, depends only on the vorticity profile \u21260(r), not on the nature of the disturbance.\nThe decay rate \u03b3qm is sensitive to any changes in this vorticity distribution near to rqm,\nas we shall see.\nThe numerical code uses only even Fourier modes in the \u03b8 direction; typical runs are\ntruncated at |k| = 256 in (2.6) and use 1500 radial grid points, with the maximum value\nof r as r0 = 15. The code uses second order finite differences for radial derivatives. The\ndiffusion term is integrated using the Crank\u2013Nicolson method and nonlinear terms using\nthe Adam\u2013Bashforth method.\nAt the origin we fix \u03c8k = 0 for all k, but at r = r0 we take\n\u03c80 = \u2212(2pi)\u22121 ln r0, \u2202r\u03c8k + r\u221210 |k|\u03c8k = 0 (k 6= 0). (3.4)\nThe second of these conditions ensures that \u03c8k matches to the irrotational flow \u03c8k \u221d r\u2212|k|\nfor r \u2265 r0. As all the wavenumbers k are multiples of m = 2, the flow velocities scale\nas r near the origin, and so there is no need for special numerical treatment of the pole\nr = 0.\n3.2. Gaussian vortex: \u03b1ext = \u03b1qm\nIn this section we consider the evolution of a Gaussian vortex when the angular velocity\nof the forcing \u03b1ext = \u03b1qm and so rext = rqm. We should stress again that the angular\nvelocity \u03b1ext of the forcing is a free parameter, and we are now choosing it to be the\nLinear and nonlinear decay of cat\u2019s eyes in two-dimensional vortices 7\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n 0\n 0  1000  2000  3000  4000  5000  6000\nln|Re(Q   )|\nt\n2\nFigure 2. From bottom left to top right, ln |Re(Q2(t))| plotted against time t, with \u03b1ext = \u03b1qm,\nT = 200, R = 107 for A = 0.000413 (dot-dash), A = 0.0103 (dot), A = 0.0206 (dash), A = 0.0413\n(wide dash), and A = 0.0825 (solid).\nsame as the quasi-mode angular velocity \u03b1qm. We then expect principally to excite this\nstructure on the vortex, as in the asymptotic framework of Balmforth et al. (2001).\nFor the Gaussian vortex given in (2.2), figure 2 shows a plot of ln |Re(Q2)|, as a\nfunction of time, for the case\nR = 107, T = 200, \u03b1ext = \u03b1qm = 0.0089. (3.5)\nThe external strain field becomes effectively negligible around t = 1000 for this value of\nT . The downward spikes of ln |Re(Q2)| in the plot correspond to points where Re(Q2) is\nzero. The full quantity Q2(t) evolves as a complex function with quickly changing phase.\nHowever the amplitude of Q2(t) and the rate of change of phase vary relatively slowly,\nespecially at large times, and we can define a time-dependent exponential decay rate \u03b3Q\nand angular velocity \u03b1Q by\n\u03b3Q(t) =\nd\ndt\nlog |Qm(t)|, \u2212m\u03b1Q(t) = d\ndt\nargQm(t). (3.6)\nThese are also the decay rate and angular velocity of the far-field flow for the m = 2\nmode.\nThe amplitudes A of the external strain used in figure 2 are given in the caption. For\nthe smallest amplitude, giving the lowest curve of the five, Q2(t) falls off exponentially,\nwith a decay rate \u03b3Q ' \u22120.0063 and angular velocity \u03b1Q ' 0.0089 (measured at time\nt = 1500) that are in agreement with (3.2). For this value of A, at around t = 3000, Q2(t)\nthen moves into a second regime described by Bassom & Gilbert (1998), where the decay\nof Q2 is dominated by the large-r form of the vorticity and is slower than exponential.\nHowever these later regimes (when the disturbance is already very weak) do not concern\nus here.\nIncreasing the amplitude of A gives the second and third curves in figure 2; the quantity\nQ2(t) still decays rapidly at times t > 1000 when the forcing is negligible. However\nnow the frequency and decay rate are different from those for the smallest value of A\n8 M. R. Turner and Andrew D. Gilbert\n(a)\n0\u03c9\nr\n(b)\n0\u2206\u03c9\nr\nFigure 3.

The\nvertical dotted line indicates the value of rqm from (3.3).\n(lowest curve) given by the Landau pole in (3.2); particularly noticeable is the curvature\nindicating that the decay is slowing down with time, i.e., the negative quantity \u03b3Q(t) is\nincreasing.\nThe reason for this effect has been suggested by Schecter et al. (2000) and Balmforth\net al. (2001): with increasing nonlinearity there is an effect on the mean vorticity profile\nand with increasing time the profile \u03c90(r, t) in (2.6) differs from the initial one \u21260(r) in\n(2.2). This effect is particularly strong in the vicinity of rqm where the profile tends to be\nflattened because of the resonant forcing of the flow from the external strain in the case\n\u03b1qm = \u03b1ext. The changes in profile can be seen in figure 3 which shows (a) \u03c90(r, t) and\nthe more informative quantity (b) \u2206\u03c90(r, t) \u2261 \u03c90(r, t) \u2212 \u21260(r). The local flattening at\nr ' rqm has the effect of changing the position of the Landau pole as time proceeds, and\nso giving a slowly varying decay rate. We will confirm this interpretation by computing\nLandau poles in section 4.\nFor still larger values of the amplitude A (upper two curves in figure 2) the quantity\nQ2(t) does not decay for large times; after an initial dip it increases to a constant level,\nwith superposed, somewhat irregular oscillations. During the increasing phase the cat\u2019s\neyes generated by the forcing grow, instead of becoming thinner and weaker as in the\ncases of smaller A, and vorticity in the vicinity of rqm overturns to form a long-lived\nnon-axisymmetric distribution. This is found by Balmforth et al. (2001) within their\nasymptotic framework and confirmed in the experiments of Schecter et al. (2000).\nFigure 3 shows how the amplitude of the forcing A modifies the mean vorticity profile\n\u03c90 for the conditions in figure 2 at t = 5000. We see that for the two largest values of\nA (solid, wide dash) the vorticity profile is modified significantly around rqm, and these\nprofiles contain fine structure from vorticity fluctuations in the cat\u2019s eyes, also seen in\nBalmforth et al. (2001). For these two largest amplitudes the mean vorticity profile is\nflattened and the vorticity homogenised in the vicinity of the critical radius rqm, here\nmarked with a vertical dotted line. For the three smaller forcing amplitudes, the profiles\ncontain no fine structure, and in fact in figure 3(a), the Gaussian profile appears almost\nunchanged; however from figure 2, it appears that even such apparently insignificant\nchanges can still have an appreciable effect on the decay rate of Q2(t). We note that as\nA decreases the width of the cat\u2019s eyes decreases and so a thinner flat region is obtained\naround r = rqm.\nThe cat\u2019s eyes generated can be seen by plotting contours of the co-rotating stream\nLinear and nonlinear decay of cat\u2019s eyes in two-dimensional vortices 9\n(a)\ny\nx\n(b)\ny\nx\nFigure 4.

The panels in\nfigure 4 plot the co-rotating stream function at t = 3000 for the two largest values of A.\nWe note again that as the amplitude of the forcing is reduced, the width of the cat\u2019s eyes\ndecreases.\nIn figures 5 and 6, we examine the form of \u03c90, \u03c80 and the real and imaginary parts of\n10 M.

For the large amplitude case in figure 5, cat\u2019s eyes have maintained\nthemselves from the initial forcing, and we see that the profile of \u03c90 has flattened out\naround r = rqm ' 4.2, there being some fine scale structure from the cat\u2019s eyes visible.\nThe m = 2 mode \u03c92 shows this fine structure again, but there is none in the perturbation\nstream function \u03c82. The fine scale structure seen in the perturbation vorticity \u03c92 is still\nvisible even when the number of radial grid points is increased to M = 9000 and is not\na numerical artefact. Note that \u03c92 is quite smooth for r less than about 2, and what we\nare seeing may be thought of as a normal mode on the core of the vortex, coupled to fine\nstructure for r greater than about 2.5.\nIn figure 6, the forcing amplitude is small enough so that Q2 decays and the thickness\nof the cat\u2019s eyes decreases with time; by t = 4000 they are extremely thin. In this case,\nthe mean stream function \u03c80 again appears unaffected by the perturbation, as does the\nmean vorticity \u03c90 which is very close to its initial Gaussian form. The structure of the\nperturbation vorticity \u03c92 and perturbation stream function \u03c82 are both very similar,\nand are dominated by the spiral wind-up of fluctuations (Bassom & Gilbert 1998). Note\nfrom these figures, 5 and 6, that the magnitude of the perturbation vorticity \u03c92 differs\nby a factor of 10 between the two cases, whereas the magnitude of the perturbation\nstream function \u03c82 differs by a factor of 2000. This highlights the contrast between the\nrelaxation to axisymmetry of the stream function in the second, weakly forced case, and\nthe presence of long-lived non-axisymmetric cat\u2019s eyes in the first, strongly forced case.\nAnother useful diagnostic here is the aspect ratio \u03bd(t), defined in (2.12), of the stream\nlines at the origin. Figure 7(a) presents \u03bd(t)\u22121 for the same data as figure 2.

Aspect ratio of the streamlines at the origin: \u03bd(t)\u2212 1 is shown for R = 107,\n\u03b1ext = \u03b1qm and, from bottom to top, increasing values of A as in figure 2.\nthat for the three smallest forcing amplitudes, the vortex does return to axisymmetry\nafter the forcing has become negligible around t = 1000. However for the two larger\namplitudes we see that the streamlines remain elliptical at the origin. For the A = 0.0825\ncase, a large peak in \u03bd(t)\u2212 1 occurs at around t = 2000, when the cat\u2019s eye motion first\nturns over, and is equivalent to the first \u2018bounce\u2019 noted by Balmforth et al. (2001). Note\nthat a 10% distortion of the streamlines at the origin in the initial phase is enough to\nprevent axisymmeterization, but the distortion then goes down to 1\u20133%, though does\nnot settle on the time-scale of the simulation. These figures are in agreement with the\n5\u201310% estimate given by Balmforth et al. (2001).\nIt is clear then that there is an amplitude threshold for the formation of long-lived cat\u2019s\neyes. However we lack a convenient and completely unambiguous numerical criterion\nfor their formation, because of the ups and downs of the Q2 curves as seen in figure\n2. A similar issue is faced by Balmforth et al. (2001) who use a criterion based on\nthe occurrence of a first bounce in the stream function within some given time. We\nhave instead focused on the behaviour of |Q2|, and its growth or decay after the initial\nrearrangement of vorticity. We use as our diagnostic:\nif\nd|Q2|\ndt\n> 0 at any point for 3000 < t < 5000, (3.7)\nthen we say that long-lived cat\u2019s eyes have formed. If however it is monotonically de-\ncreasing in this region, then we take it that the vortex is relaxing to axisymmetry.\nFigure 8 shows a plot in the (A, T )-plane indicating points where the diagnostic (3.7)\nis satisfied for the Gaussian vortex, compiled from a series of runs with \u03b1ext = \u03b1qm and\nR = 107. Above the contour, the cat\u2019s eyes generated in the Gaussian vortex persist and\ngrow, and below this contour, the cat\u2019s eyes die away. In the case of a Gaussian vortex,\nas T \u2192 0 the forcing approaches the limit of an instantaneous kick, and the threshold\nvalue of A ' 0.033.\nBalmforth et al.

Although their diagnostic is different, and their definitions of A and T\nalso differ from ours, the two plots are similar, with a drop in the threshold value of A\nas T increases.\nWe have not tried to pursue the issue of the behaviour of the threshold A as T increases,\nas long-time runs at low amplitudes and high Reynolds numbers become numerically\nimpractical. Within their model Balmforth et al. (2001) study the threshold based on a\ncriterion of when the function \u2206\u03c90 (Z\u221e in their work) first develops a turning point. For\ntheir forcing they determine this contour in the (A, T )-plane analytically, and so suggest\nthe scaling of threshold amplitude A = O(1\/T ) \u2212\u2192 0 as T \u2212\u2192 \u221e. Our threshold also\nfalls off with increasing T , but we have not attempted to determine a power law.\nIn the limit of large T , the evolution in the steady state problem of constant amplitude\nforcing becomes relevant, and this is currently under investigation (see also Lingevitch\n& Bernoff (1995) for the linear problem at finite Reynolds number). Here we note that\nat the larger amplitudes considered in the present paper, the structure of the vortex\ncontinues to evolve on time-scales rather greater than those considered here, for example\nas measured by |Q2(t)| which shows slow, irregular oscillations.\n3.3. Formation of cat\u2019s eyes for members of the tanh vortex family\nThe simulations of \u00a73.2 and \u00a75 for an initial Gaussian vortex can also be applied to other\nvortices. In this section we take a brief look at what happens when the tanh vortex given\nby (2.4) is subjected to a forcing with \u03b1ext = \u03b1qm.\nFigure 9 shows plots of ln |Re(Q2)| at the five values of A used in figure 2, for the tanh\nvortex (2.4) with \u03c3 = (a) 0.1, (b) 0.5 and (c) 0.9.

(2001). In the limiting case\n\u03c3 = 1 we recover a top-hat vortex, which possesses a normal mode, a Kelvin mode,\nand the amplitude threshold becomes zero. We also observe the presence of long time-\nscales emerging in these long runs, again in keeping with asymptotic theory, in which the\ninverse time-scale and amplitude scale with powers of the vorticity gradient \u2126\u20320(rqm) at\nthe radius rqm, vanishing in the limit \u03c3 \u2192 1.\n4. Landau Poles\nThe quasi-modes of a circular vortex have been studied by taking the Laplace trans-\nform of the initial value problem for linear, inviscid disturbances to the vortex profile\n(Briggs et al. 1970; Corngold 1995; Schecter et al. 2000). Using this method, the frequency\n\u2212m\u03b1qm and the decay rate \u03b3qm appear as the real and imaginary parts of the complex\ngrowth rate \u2212ipqm from a Landau pole at pqm in the notation below. This gives exponen-\n14 M. R. Turner and Andrew D. Gilbert\ntial decay as part of the initial transient behaviour of perturbations to the vortex. It is\nreally a cooperative effect of the continuous spectrum, but may be revealed by analytical\ncontinuation techniques (Briggs et al. 1970) as a complex frequency at which the Laplace\ntransform of the multipole moment (2.9) is singular. Schecter et al. (2000) discuss how\nto calculate the Landau pole numerically for a Gaussian vortex in the bounded domain\nr \u2208 [0, r0], with the outer boundary condition of constant \u03c8 on r = r0.\nWe re-examine this method in our context, calculate Landau poles in the infinite\ndomain r \u2208 [0,\u221e) for different profiles \u21260(r) and show how these Landau poles relate to\nthe decay rates for Q2 that we observed in section \u00a73. We only sketch the calculations,\nfollowing closely Briggs et al. (1970) and Schecter et al. (2000), which should be consulted\nfor more details. Linearizing (2.1) about the mean profile \u21260(r) and \u03a80(r) leads to the\nfollowing pair of equations\n\u2202t\u03c9\u02c6 + im\u03b1(r)\u03c9\u02c6 + im\u03b2(r)\u03c8\u02c6 = 0, \u03c9\u02c6 = \u2212\u2206\u03c8\u02c6, (4.1)\nwhere \u2206 \u2261 \u22022r + r\u22121\u2202r\u2212m2r\u22122 and \u03c9\u02c6, \u03c8\u02c6 are linear perturbations, of mode m, to \u21260, \u03a80\nrespectively. The angular velocity \u03b1(r) and vorticity gradient r\u03b2(r) are defined by\n\u03b1(r) = \u2212r\u22121\u2202r\u03a80, \u03b2(r) = r\u22121\u2202r\u21260, (4.2)\nwhere the mean vorticity and stream function are linked by \u21260 = \u2212r\u22121\u2202r(r\u2202r\u03a80).\nWe define the Laplace transform pair with respect to t by\nf\u00af(p) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\neiptf\u02c6(t) dt, f\u02c6(t) = \u2212 1\n2pi\n\u222b \u2212\u221e+i\u03b4\n\u221e+i\u03b4\ne\u2212iptf\u00af(p) dp, (4.3)\nwith any real \u03b4 > 0.

(4.4)\nThe function Qm from (2.9) may be related to the stream function \u03c8\u02c6,\nQm(t) = lim\nr\u2192\u221e(mr\nm\u03c8\u02c6 \u2212 rm+1\u2202r\u03c8\u02c6). (4.5)\nIn practice one considers an outer boundary r = r0 \u001d 1 and can either impose zero\nstream function there, \u03c8\u02c6 = 0, or irrotational flow beyond, \u2202r\u03c8\u02c6 + mr\u22121\u03c8\u02c6 = 0. For our\npurposes, both amount to the same for large r0 and so we use the former. The r0 here is\nanalogous to the position of the wall used by Schecter et al. (2000), but we let r0 \u2192 \u221e\nto produce our results for an infinite domain.\nSolving (4.4) by means of the appropriate Green\u2019s function (Briggs et al. 1970; Corngold\n1995), the Laplace transform of Qm can be written\nQ\u00afm(p) = \u2212 ir\nm+1\n\u03a8L(r, p)\n\u222b r\n0\ns\u03a8L(s, p)\u03c9\u02c6(s, 0)\nr(m\u03b1(s)\u2212 p) ds\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nr=r0\n, (4.6)\nwhere the function \u03a8L(r, p) satisfies the homogeneous version of equation (4.4),[\n\u22022\n\u2202r2\n+\n1\nr\n\u2202\n\u2202r\n\u2212 m\n2\nr2\n+\nm\u03b2(r)\np\u2212m\u03b1(r)\n]\n\u03a8L(r, p) = 0, (4.7)\nwith \u03a8L(r, p) = 0 at r = 0.\nIf the vorticity profile is smooth and monotonically decreasing on the whole domain\nr \u2208 [0, r0], then there are no discrete eigenmodes of the vortex (Briggs et al. 1970).\nLinear and nonlinear decay of cat\u2019s eyes in two-dimensional vortices 15\n(a)\n 0\n 0.2\n 0.4\n 0.6\n 0.8\n 1\n 1.2\n 1.4\n 0  2  4  6  8  10  12  14\nRe(r)\nIm(r)\n(b)\n-0.035\n-0.03\n-0.025\n-0.02\n-0.015\n-0.01\n-0.005\n 0\n 0.005\n 0  0.01  0.02  0.03  0.04  0.05  0.06  0.07  0.08\nRe(p)\nIm(p)\nFigure 10.

Figure (b) shows a discrete approximation to the continuous spectrum as well as\nthe Landau pole at p = 0.0177\u2212 0.0063i.\nTherefore there are no discrete values of p for which \u03a8L(r0, p) = 0, and no poles in\nQ\u00afm(p) which would give exponential terms in the inversion of the Laplace transform.\nHowever, there is a branch cut along the real p axis in the range m\u03b1(r0) \u2264 p \u2264 m\u03b1(0).\nUsing analytic continuation, however, it is possible to deform this branch cut below\nthe real p axis, by deforming the radial contour of integration in (4.6) above the real r\naxis. If the branch cut is bent sufficiently far below the real p axis, then one or more\nLandau poles p = p0 may appear in the analytic continuation of Q\u00afm(p) between the\nbranch cut and the real p axis. The is seen in figure 10 for the case for a Gaussian vortex\n(2.2). When the inversion contour is deformed around such a pole and the branch cut,\nthis leads to a term in Qm(t) of the form e\u2212ip0t, which can dominate the early evolution\nof Qm(t) but which does not correspond to a normal mode; of course \u2212ip0 \u2261 \u2212ipqm is\nthe complex quasi-mode growth rate, used first in (3.1).\nTo track down Landau poles we use contours in the complex r plane of the general\nform, parameterised by s,\nr(s) = tan\n(\npi\n2\n[\ns+ i\u03c11s exp\n(\n1\n\u03c12s\u03c13(s\u2212 1)\n)])\n, (4.8)\nwhere \u03c11, \u03c12 and \u03c13 are constants. Here s is real, in the range [0, 1], and the r contour\ngoes from zero to (real) infinity. The form of \u03a8L(r, p) as r \u2192 0 is rm, and so near the\norigin we impose boundary conditions on (4.7) at s = \u03b5\u001c 1,\n\u03a8L(r(\u03b5), p) = rm(\u03b5),\n\u2202\u03a8L\n\u2202s\n(r(\u03b5), p) = mr\u2032(\u03b5)rm\u22121(\u03b5). (4.9)\nEquation (4.7), with a Gaussian or tanh profile substituted, is then solved by inte-\ngrating from s = 0 to s = 1 along (4.8) by a Runge\u2013Kutta method, and p is updated\nby Newton\u2019s method to make \u03a8L zero at s = 1. For the contour in (4.8), we use typical\nvalues for the constants \u03c11 = 3\/2, \u03c12 = 2 and \u03c13 = 0. However the value of \u03c13 has to\nbe increased when we consider the tanh vortex, because there is an infinite set of branch\npoints of \u03b10(r), given by (2.5), in the complex r plane, which all tend to r = 1 as \u03c3 \u2192 1.\nIn this case the r contour has to be chosen carefully to negotiate these.\nEquation (4.7) may also be solved with homogeneous boundary conditions using a\nglobal eigenvalue method (Schmid & Henningson 2001): this was used to obtain figure\n10, showing the Landau pole and also an approximation to the continuous spectrum on\n16 M.

The dashed lines show the\napproximations discussed in the text.\nthe distorted branch cut. Both the global and local method have their advantages and\ndisadvantages; however we found that the global method helped to provide a good initial\nguess for the local method, which then may be used to give a more accurate value for\nthe Landau pole. The results of our computations are given in (3.1, 3.2) for the Gaussian\nvortex and in (3.8) for the tanh family.\nFrom (4.7), the determination of the Landau pole depends on the angular velocity\nprofile \u03b1(r) and the gradient of the mean vorticity profile r\u03b2(r) = \u2126\u20320(r). We found in \u00a73\nthat even when a disturbance ultimately decays, the mean vorticity profile is modified\nduring the initial transient, which can move the Landau pole and change the decay rate.\nHere we show that the modifications found in \u00a73 give decay rates which agree with the\nnonlinear code for small A. Landau poles are obtained by analytic continuation, and this\nprocess is not very stable when applied directly to numerical output from our dynamical\nruns. Our strategy is to approximate the modified vorticity profile by simple analytical\nfunctions, and then to use this in the Landau pole code.\nExamples of the modification \u2206\u03c90 to the profile from \u00a73 are shown in figure 11. Note\nthat there is some effect of viscosity visible, giving negative \u2206\u03c90 at the smaller values\nof r; the Landau pole is not sensitive to this, but it is to the structure near to rqm. We\napproximate the curves in figure 11 using the family of functions\n\u2206\u03c90 = (a1r + b1) exp\n(\n\u2212 (r \u2212 c1)\n2\nd21\n)\n+ (a2r + b2) exp\n(\n\u2212 (r \u2212 c2)\n2\nd22\n)\n, (4.10)\nwhere ai, bi, ci and di are constants. Figure 11(a) shows an example of this approxima-\ntion as a dashed line. We generally fixed these constants by requiring agreement of the\npositions of the turning points, and the values of \u2206\u03c90 at these points. This was done in\nfigure 11(a) but in 11(b) this gave a poor approximation to the gradient at rqm and a\npoor estimate of the decay rate. Therefore for figure 11(b), we added to our first fit the\nfunction 10\u22125\u00d7 exp(\u2212(r\u2212 4.2)2\/0.22). This fit, depicted as a dashed line in figure 11(b),\ngives a better approximation to this gradient, and so an improved value for the Landau\npole.\nFigure 12 shows a plot of ln |Q2| against time t for selected values of the amplitude\nA for the external angular velocity, \u03b1ext = \u03b1qm.

This\nmethod may give improved results, though the better the approximation on the real line,\nthe more rapid will be the growth of its analytic continuation in the complex plane, which\nmay limit this approach.\n5. Numerical results: varying the external frequency\nIn \u00a73.2 we considered forcing a vortex with an angular velocity equal to that of the\nquasi-mode. In this section we consider how a Gaussian vortex evolves when the forcing\nterm has an angular velocity \u03b1ext different from \u03b1qm. We recall that together with \u03b1ext\nwe can associate a radius rext, where fluid particles co-rotate and where, at least initially,\ncat\u2019s eyes will tend to form. Of course as the profile changes under dynamical evolution,\nfrequencies and radii can change, particularly at late times when the forcing is switched\noff. We therefore measure the frequency \u03b1Q from Q2, and obtain a corresponding resonant\nradius rQ. For an independent estimate of radius we can take the point rcross at which\n\u2206\u03c90 crosses the horizontal axis; see figure 2(b) above, or 13(b,d) below. We pose the\nquestion: for a given input angular velocity \u03b1ext and radius rext, where do the cat\u2019s eyes\nform, as measured by rQ and rcross?\nTo begin with, we present a series of runs that parallel those with \u03b1ext = \u03b1qm in figure\n2, but with \u03b1ext larger in figure 13(a,b) and smaller in 13(c,d). In the first pair of panels,\nthe larger value of \u03b1ext corresponds to attempting to generate cat\u2019s eyes closer to the\norigin, at rext = 3.3, and indeed the crossing point rcross in 13(b) is rather closer to the\norigin. Note that this crossing point is rather insensitive to the amplitude A: all the curves\nin 13(b) cross the horizontal axis at approximately the same point. For the second pair\n18 M. R.

The amplitudes are given by A = 0.000413 (dot\ndash), A = 0.0103 (dot), A = 0.0206 (dash), A = 0.0413 (wide dash) and A = 0.0825 (solid).\nThe vertical dotted line in (b, d) indicates the value of rext of (b) 3.3 and (d) 5.2 respectively.\nof panels, figure 13(c,d), the small value of \u03b1ext corresponds to larger rext = 5.2; however\nthis appears to be rather larger than the crossing point rcross, which is again insensitive\nto the amplitude A of the forcing. Thus the behaviour appears different, depending on\nwhether the external frequency \u03b1ext is larger or smaller than the quasi-mode frequency\n\u03b1qm, something we will pick up again shortly.\nWe note that in general there is a higher amplitude threshold for cat\u2019s eye formation in\nfigure 13 than in the \u03b1ext = \u03b1qm case (figure 2), as expected. Again when decay occurs,\nthe decay rate may be modified by structure in the mean profile, and as an example of\nthis we show in figure 14 a comparison of decay rates for the \u03b1ext = 0.014 high frequency\ncase, and those obtained from a fit of (4.10) to the modification \u2206\u03c90 of the profile. The\nnumerical values obtained are\n1 : A = 0.0137, \u03b3Q(2000) = \u22120.0044, \u03b3qm = \u22120.00456,\n2 : A = 0.0103, \u03b3Q(2000) = \u22120.0049, \u03b3qm = \u22120.00504, (5.1)\n3 : A = 0.00515, \u03b3Q(2000) = \u22120.0058, \u03b3qm = \u22120.00584.\nA plot of \u03bd(t) \u2212 1 in figure 15 shows similar results for all three frequencies of \u03b1ext and\nA = 0.0825, though with most variability for the high frequency \u03b1ext of curve 2.

First we can highlight curve 3 which shows rext as a function of \u03b1ext\nindicating the point that smaller \u03b1ext corresponds to larger radii and vice-versa. The\ncurves 1 and 2 show the two diagnostics, rQ computed from the measured angular velocity\n\u03b1Q using \u03b10(rQ) = \u03b1Q, and the crossing point rcross of the modification to the profile. We\nnote that these two curves generally agree well as a measure of the radius at which cat\u2019s\neyes form, across the whole range of \u03b1ext. (Note that we use \u03b10(r) to translate between\nradii and frequencies; use of \u03b1(r, t) gives similar answers, differing only by a few percent.)\nFor higher angular velocities, to the right of panel 16(b) the three curves are broadly in\nagreement, and cat\u2019s eyes appear to form at the radii linked to rext, in other words at the\nradius chosen by the forcing angular velocity \u03b1ext. At lower angular velocities however,\non the left, curves 1 and 2 tend roughly to the radius rqm for the quasi-mode; the forcing\nangular velocity is not relevant and cat\u2019s eyes form at rqm regardless of the external\nangular velocity imposed.\nTo understand these differences in behaviour depending on how \u03b1ext compares with\n\u03b1qm it is worth saying more about the asymptotic model of Balmforth et al. (2001)\nwhich gives some insight into what determines the structure, decay rate and frequency\nof a quasi-mode. These authors use a model in which a compact vortex, that is one with\na vorticity distribution vanishing beyond some radius rc, supports an undamped normal\nmode; one can imagine for example a top-hat vortex supporting a Kelvin mode. This\nis the normal mode component of the quasi-mode, and has frequency \u03b1qm and critical\nradius rqm > rc, associated with the structure of the compact vortex. The authors then\nadd a \u2018skirt\u2019 of weak vorticity, and in the vicinity of rqm, the wind-up of vorticity leads\nto damping of the normal mode and gives a damping rate \u03b3qm < 0 proportional to the\nvorticity gradient in the skirt at rqm. The combination of the normal mode and wind-up\nof vorticity near rqm constitute the quasi-mode.\nA Gaussian vortex does not have an obvious compact vortex plus skirt structure, but\nit appears useful to model it qualitatively in these terms (Balmforth et al. 2001). We\ncan informally and very roughly take r less than about 3.5 as the compact vortex core,\nand larger values of r as falling in the skirt. We can then interpret our results as follows.\nFor low external angular velocities \u03b1ext and so higher values of rext, the external flow\nrearranges vorticity in the skirt and excites the quasi-mode structure. But when the\nexternal forcing is switched off, the original quasi-mode (whose structure depends on\nLinear and nonlinear decay of cat\u2019s eyes in two-dimensional vortices 21\n1\n2\n3\n0\u2206\u03c9\nr\nFigure 17. \u2206\u03c90 (solid) and the approximation using (5.2) (dot) for A = 0.0825 and\n1 : \u03b1ext = \u03b1qm, 2 : \u03b1ext = 0.014 and 3 : \u03b1ext = 0.006. Each result is separated by a con-\nstant, and taken at t = 5000.\nthe unaffected core of the vortex) takes over and cat\u2019s eyes appear at the radius rqm,\nregardless of the initial rext.\nOn the other hand when the external angular velocity is higher, the external flow\nrearranges vorticity within the compact vortex, closer to the origin. Above the threshold\nfor cat\u2019s eye formation it appears to have such a strong effect that the changed profile\ncan now support cat\u2019s eyes at the radius rext imposed by the forcing. To confirm this\ninterpretation we fitted the modification \u2206\u03c90 to the profile at t = 5000 using the form\n\u2206\u03c90 = (ar + b) exp\n(\n\u2212 (r \u2212 c)\n2\nd2\n)\n, (5.2)\nwhere a, b, c and d are constants. The modifications to the profile give new values for\n\u03b1qm and rqm, and these may be compared with those measured, \u03b1Q and rQ from the\nLandau pole code. We find\n\u03b1ext = 0.089, \u03b1qm = 0.0109, rqm = 3.77, \u03b1Q = 0.0107, rQ = 3.80,\n\u03b1ext = 0.014, \u03b1qm = 0.0128, rqm = 3.43, \u03b1Q = 0.0126, rQ = 3.46,\n\u03b1ext = 0.006, \u03b1qm = 0.0101, rqm = 3.93, \u03b1Q = 0.0101, rQ = 3.93.\nThe points obtained by the Landau pole code are also shown as stars on figure 16(a) for\n\u03b1Q and on 16(b) for rQ. There is good agreement confirming the interpretation given\nabove, despite the relatively crude fitting of the data in figure 17.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this paper we studied how a vortex relaxes after it is subjected to an external\nforcing which generates cat\u2019s eyes inside the vortex. For the Gaussian vortex we mapped\nout a contour in the (A, T )-plane parameterising the forcing, above which cat\u2019s eyes are\nmaintained, and below which the vortex relaxes to axisymmetry. This is in agreement\n22 M. R. Turner and Andrew D. Gilbert\nwith the asymptotic model of Balmforth et al. (2001) and the experimental results of\nSchecter et al. (2000). We computed Landau poles and confirmed that when the vortex\ndoes return to axisymmetry, the decay rate of fluctuations is linked to the Landau pole\nof the linear inviscid problem, and that this decay rate can vary as the mean profile is\nmodified through nonlinear effects during the initial transient. In this sense we have a\n\u2018nonlinear\u2019 decay rate: nonlinearity in the initial phase controls the decay rate of linear\nfluctuations in the later phase. We furthermore explored the response of the vortex to\nvarying values of the external angular velocity and its impact on the location of cat\u2019s\neyes. We find that for angular velocities less than or equal to that of the quasi-mode, we\ntend to excite just the quasi-mode, and cat\u2019s eyes at the radius rqm with angular velocity\n\u03b1qm. However for external angular velocities greater than \u03b1qm the effect of forcing the\nvortex is to change the vorticity profile to such an extent that cat\u2019s eyes are supported\nat radii distinct from, and smaller than, that of the quasi-mode rqm. We found that\napplying the Landau pole calculation to the modified mean profile gave good agreement\nwith the frequency and thus the radius at which cat\u2019s eyes form.\nWe now compare with the work of Le Dize`s (2000) who studies the form of steadily\nrotating cat\u2019s eyes embedded in a vortex. His approach is to consider cat\u2019s eyes localised\nin an asymptotically thin critical layer which affects the flow outside through a jump\ncondition (Benney & Bergeron 1969; Haberman 1972; Brown & Stewartson 1978; Smith\n& Bodonyi 1982). The critical layer may be nonlinear and inviscid, or can be viscous in\nwhich case an external forcing is required to maintain a steadily rotating state. The key\nparameters in this study are the Reynolds number R and a parameter \u03b5 \u001c 1, which is\nlinked to the aspect ratio of the flow at the origin, with \u03bd \u2212 1 = O(\u03b5), and the cat\u2019s eye\nwidth, of order\n\u221a\n\u03b5. In the case of a Gaussian vortex, with no external strain, the cat\u2019s\neyes in the study Le Dize`s (2000) are localised at a radius r = 3.44 and have angular\nvelocity \u03b1 = 0.0127, in our units, in the inviscid limit \u000f3R \u001d 1. This suggests that this\nangular velocity gives a resonant response to the vortex and that cat\u2019s eyes are more\nlikely to persist at this radius.\nThe key difference between this study and ours is that we have forced the vortex with a\ntransient, relatively high amplitude external flow, which necessarily means the formation\nof broad cat\u2019s eyes, in the cases when they form. The study Le Dize`s (2000) involves the\nlimit of infinitesimally thin cat\u2019s eyes, and these may only be produced by forcing the\nvortex at a low amplitude A for a long time T , a limit we have not addressed in this\npaper. The paper Le Dize`s (2000) suggests that weak forcing at a frequency \u03b1ext = 0.0127\nshould give a resonant response that should lead to the formation of a thin band of cat\u2019s\neyes for large values of T .\nTo investigate this we have undertaken a few runs at this value of \u03b1ext, with some\nresults shown in figure 18, which presents the aspect ratio of the streamlines at the\norigin for A = 0.0825, T = 200, and \u03b1ext = 0.014, 0.0127 = \u03b1LD and 0.0089 = \u03b1qm.\nThere are minor differences between the results in figure 18; however they are not too\nsignificant for this value of T . There is no obvious resonant response at \u03b1LD, and also\nwe find that a larger amplitude is required to obtain persistent cat\u2019s eyes, compared\nwith \u03b1qm. In short, for the moderate time-scales of our forcing (and high amplitudes)\nwe do not observe any resonant effects at\u03b1LD. However there is preliminary evidence\nfrom longer runs (which we do not present here) that for rather larger values of T , the\nthreshold for cat\u2019s eyes in the case \u03b1LD may drop below that for the case \u03b1qm. This\nissue of how a vortex evolves over long time-scales under weak forcing remains an area\nof further study. Another topic under investigation is how closely these results may be\nlinked to the tripolar vortices of Rossi et al. (1997).\nLinear and nonlinear decay of cat\u2019s eyes in two-dimensional vortices 23\n 0\n 0.05\n 0.1\n 0.15\n 0.2\n 0.25\n 0.3\n 0.35\n 0.4\n 0  1000  2000  3000  4000  5000  6000\n\u03bd\u22121\nt\n1\n2\n3\nFigure 18.
