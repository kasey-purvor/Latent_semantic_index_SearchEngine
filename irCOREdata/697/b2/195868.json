This carries the risk of misdiagnosis and under- or \novertreatment. The focus in asthma management has shifted to the underlying \nchronic airway inflammation. We are developing a novel approach in which breath \nsamples are analysed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that alone or in \ncombination may be used as biomarkers for airway inflammation. The aims of the \ncurrent study are (1) to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the sampling \nprocedures for children aged 8-16 years, and (2) to collect preliminary data on \npotential candidate markers. \n \nMethods \nChildren were recruited from Asthma clinics, or in response to posters in the hospital \n(controls). Nitric oxide and spirometry measurements were made and clinical \nmetadata recorded. Exhaled breath was collected onto an adsorbent VOC sampling \ntube using a face mask supplied with purified medical-air under computer control to \nenhance reproducibility. [1] Breath samples were collected with the child in a relaxed \nstate watching TV. No specific breathing manoeuvres were required. Three attempts \nto collect breath from each child were made (5-8 minutes per sample). The child \ncompleted a feedback form on the procedure, based on a Likert scale. Breath \nsamples were analysed by thermal desorption \u2013 gas chromatography \u2013 mass \nspectrometry\/differential mobility spectrometry. \n \nResults \nAt the time of abstract submission seven children aged 9 to 14 (5 with asthma) had \nparticipated. All were able to provide three samples and feedback showed that they \nwere all \u201cwilling to undertake this test again if asked to do so.\u201d One participant \nreported slight discomfort while wearing the face mask. The gas chromatograph-\nmass spectrometer data (Fig) that allow the relative concentrations of the different \nvolatile components of exhaled breath to be estimated were comparable to data \npreviously obtained in adults. \n \nConclusions \nThe sampling procedure is entirely acceptable to children. Larger numbers of children \nshould reveal whether this new metabolomic approach to asthma, coupled with \nadvanced statistical approaches, is likely to provide molecular biomarkers useful for \nnon-invasive diagnosis and management. \n \n1.
