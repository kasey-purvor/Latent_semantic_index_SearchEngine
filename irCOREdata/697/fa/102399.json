Generally speaking, ARQ-based\ntechniques are unattractive due to the feedback implosion they\ngenerate. Furthermore, in broadcast\/multicast wireless networks,\nradio resources are scarce and feedback may not be an option at\nall. Two error mitigation mechanisms that become relevant in\nthis scenario are data carousels and PLFEC. In this work, we\nconsider the application of these two techniques as components of\nan integrated layer in satellite environments. We also investigate\nthe impact of the type of PLFEC code, small or large, on the\nmain user-oriented performance metric of the data carousels, the\naverage content download time.\nIndex Terms-Data carousels; FEC; point-to-multipoint\ncommunications; reliable multicast\nI. INTRODUCTION\nOne of the key research issues concerning broadcasting to\nmobile users over wireless links is reliable content delivery.\nInformation loss may occur for a number of reasons: radio\ntransmission errors due to the impairments of the wireless\nlink(s), intermittent connectivity during cell handovers in\ncellular networks and more system-specific reasons such as the\noccasional preemption of the satellite signal reception by the\nterrestrial cellular mobile network in the case of the\nforthcoming Satellite Digital Multimedia Broadcasting\n(SDMB) system [1]. Data loss may be tolerable to a certain\nextent for some applications, e.g., video, but not for other\napplications such as software distribution. Although data loss\nmitigation techniques are deployed at the access layer of\nmobile wireless networks, such as forward error correction,\ninterleaving, interference cancellation, and applications feature\ntheir own mechanisms for coping with data loss, such as error\nconcealment techniques for multimedia applications, additional\nprotection at the transport layer is deemed necessary in order to\nsatisfy the performance requirements of the envisaged\napplications.\nIn wired networks, the feedback implosion effect related to\nthe automatic repeat request (ARQ)-based techniques is\nM. Karaliopoulos\nNew Technologies and Applications Group\nTeletel SA\n116 36 Athens, Greece\nM.Karaliopoulosgteletel.gr\naddressed via use of back-off timers and feedback aggregation;\nthese approaches take advantage of the tree structure of wired\nnetworks and the variable delay therein. The same techniques\nare more difficult to implement in wireless access networks, in\nparticular satellite systems, which serve a much higher\npopulation of terminals and often feature strict power budgets\non both the satellite and the satellite terminal side. These same\nreasons may even completely preclude the use of a feedback\nchannel. Packet-level forward error correction (PLFEC) and\ndata carousels, possibly combined with interleaving, are then\nthe remaining options for the design of the reliable multicast\ntransport layer. Notably, three emerging solutions for\nmultimedia broadcasting to mobile terminals, the Third\nGeneration Partnership Project (3GPP) Multimedia\nBroadcast\/Multicast Service (MBMS) framework [2], the\nEuropean Digital Video Broadcasting standard for mobile\nhandheld terminals (DVB-H) [3], and the SDMB system, rely\non some form of PLFEC, hereafter called FEC, and data\ncarousels for enhancing the reliability of data delivery, all\navoiding the use ofARQ-based schemes.\nBoth error mitigation techniques have been studied\nextensively but separately. We first proposed an integrated\ncarousel-FEC layer employing small FEC codes in [4]. Herein,\nwe extend that work in investigating the use of large codes and\nthe combination of both small and large codes in the\nimplementation of data carousels, focusing on satellite\nenvironments. We first describe the considered satellite system\nmodel in section II, before outlining the integrated carousel-\nFEC layer in section III and the main analytical equations\nrelated to it. Numerical results are presented and discussed in\nsection IV and our conclusions are given in section V.\nII. THE SATELLITE LINK MODEL\nThe satellite network setting we consider is illustrated in Fig.\n1. Despite ignoring the specific engineering details of different\nsystems, the model serves the analytical objectives of this\npaper.\nThe elementary data unit we consider is the UDP\/IP packet.\nGenerally, the end-to-end communication may suffer data loss\nThis work has partially been supported by the European Union in the\ncontext of the Framework Program 6 Integrated Project MAESTRO (Mobile\nApplications & sErvices based on Satellite and Terrestrial inteRwOrking).\nMAESTRO started in January 2004 and its first phase is planned to finish in\nDecember 2005.\nWebsite: http:\/\/ist-maestro.dyndns.org\/MAESTRO\/index.htm.\n0-7803-9206-X\/05\/$20.00 \u00a92005 IEEE 812\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Simple model of the via-satellite content path\ndue to either congestion at the wired path segment (sender-\nsatellite gateway) or link impairments over the wireless link.\nLet Pc be the mean packet loss probability at the wired\nsegment. On the other hand, radio link impairments may give\nrise to either uniform or burst packet loss at the packet level,\ndepending on the propagation channel dynamics, the user\nmobility and the specific access layer mechanisms. In this\npaper, we adopt the assumption ofuniform packet loss, leaving\nthe study of burst packet loss impact for future work. We\ndiscriminate between the mean packet loss probability at the\nuplink Pu and packet probability loss at the downlink pD.\nNote that Pu is the same for all sender-receiver pairs, whereas\nPD varies due to the spatial separation and\/or qualitative\ndifferentiation ofreceivers.\nThe overall probability of packet loss, assuming\nindependence of the packet loss processes in the three\nsegments, is\np (l- Pu ).(l- PD)(- PC) (1)\nAssuming that packet loss at the wired segment is\nnegligible, pC = 0, the end-to-end packet loss can be written\nP PU +PD PU'PD (2)\nIII. THE INTEGRATED CAROUSEL-FEC LAYER\nWith data carousels information is organized into data items,\ncorresponding to a single file or a batch of files, which are\ntransmitted repeatedly in the broadcast medium according to a\nspecific schedule. Users have the chance to acquire items of\ninterest to them only at given time instants corresponding to the\noccurrences of these items in the schedule, rather than on\ndemand. In case they do not succeed in retrieving the whole\nitem by the it attempt, they will have to wait for subsequent\nappearances ofthe item till they retrieve it correctly. However,\na well-designed schedule takes into account the relative\ndemand for each data item, so that the number of appearances\nof each item in the schedule increases with its demand\nprobability. This way the average time required from a random\nuser to retrieve an item can be minimized [5] and the\ninteractivity perceived by the user (pseudo-interactivity)\nimproves.\nLet t' be the download time for item i and user k; namely,\nthe time that elapses between the time instant when the user\nexpresses his desire to access item i, to the time when the item\nis retrieved from its schedule and is stored at his terminal [5].\nThe mean response (or download) time S, the key user-\noriented metric for the carousel efficiency, is then defined as\nthe expected value of t' when considering the whole user\npopulation and all carousel items. It is shown in [5] that under\nthe optimum broadcast schedule design strategy, the average\nresponse time S.,, may be written as\nS -p,= , _1 _1+2_ (p) (3)\nwhere M is the number of items in the schedule and the\nfunction r, computes the mean number of required re-\nappearances of data item i (each one associated with a demand\nprobability value q, and length Ij) after its first appearance, so\nthat it is fully retrieved in the presence of data loss.\nIn the integrated carousel-FEC layer, the individual items\nthat compose the data carousel are encoded. Coding is applied\nat the transport layer, resulting in additional packets being\ntransmitted on top ofthe original data packets. The information\nredundancy that is added to the original data aims at quicker\nitem recovery when data loss occurs.\nThe joint use of FEC and carousels introduces a trade-off\nwith respect to the mean download time. Higher levels ofFEC\nredundancy improve the error correction capability of the FEC\ncodes, resulting in quicker download times, since a user has\nhigher chances to download an item in fewer attempts. On the\ncontrary, higher FEC redundancy levels add to the equivalent\nlength of items and increase the spacing between appearances\nof a particular item in the schedule, resulting in higher response\ntimes. An integrated carousel-FEC design is characterized\noptimum, when it minimizes the average user download time,\nwhilst also keeping the redundancy introduced by FEC at a\nminimum.\nA. Configuration alternativesfor the integrated carousel-\nFEC layer\nThe integrated carousel-FEC layer may be configured with\nrespect to the following aspects:\n1) Item Retrieval Technique (IRT): The way the data items\nare retrieved from the transmitted carousel may vary: the 1-shot\nretrieval and the cumulative retrieval are the two main\nalternatives. With 1-shot retrieval, the application attempts to\nrecover an item from the carousel in one-go; therefore, if an\nitem is recovered partially, the correctly received packets are\ndiscarded and the retrieval of the item in question starts from\nscratch upon its next appearance. On the other hand, the\ncumulative approach entails the storing of correctly received\npackets and the step-by-step item retrieval during its successive\nappearances.\n2) Type ofFEC code (large or small): In general, there are\ntwo types of codes: small and large [6]. Small codes e.g., Reed-\nSolomon (RS), require larger files to be split up into several\nFEC blocks in order to better manage the complex Galois Field\narithmetic. In contrast, large codes e.g., Low Density Generator\n813\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on April 15,2010 at 09:29:40 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nMatrix (LDGM), require simple XOR operations; thus, large\ncodes have higher codec throughputs compared to small codes\n[6], [7]. The capability of large codes to encode a large file in\none FEC block is quite beneficial since large FEC blocks have\nhigher bandwidth efficiency compared to small FEC blocks as\ndemonstrated in [6], [7], and section IV herein. The advantage\nof large codes with respect to the achievable codec throughput\nhas to be assessed taking into account the transmission rates\nsupported by the different systems. For low transmission rates,\ne.g., the upper limit of 384kbps for MBMS and S-DMB, the\nsystem bottleneck will be the transmission capacity rather than\nthe codec speed. On the other hand, benefits are more evident\nin the case of low-end handheld devices with limited\nprocessing resources.\nThe advantage of small codes is that in order to recover a\nFEC block, their codec requires the correct reception of at least\nany k packets out of the n sent as indicated by (4). On the\ncontrary, a large decoder requires a minimum number of\n(I + r0). k packets to recover the original k, where r0 is the\nreception overhead which is lower for large files compared to\nsmaller ones. This reception overhead' exists for large codes\nbecause, unlike in a RS FEC block, each equation generating\neach parity packet does not involve all the original packets.\nThe corresponding equations for the small (large) code block\nerror rate FBLERs (FBLER L) and the probabilities of full\nacquisition of each item in the two cases PJS(00 are given by\nFBLERs = E , )pj (I - pJn (4)j=n-k+l\nPF = (I -FBLERS) a. (5)\nn\nFBLERL = ( )p (I-P) j =PL\"o (6)\nj=n-k(l+r )+I\n0\nWe could generalize (3) and write for the mean download time\nwith the integrated carousel-FEC layer:\nS,, (k,.)= 2 (Eqi -SFi 1 [I -1+2r,(k,,,ns,Ns rO)) (7)\nwhich, for the number ofFEC blocks NB = I and r0 :0O points\nto large codes, whereas for NB 21 and ri = 0, it captures the\nsmall codes. In both cases, the overhead due to the inclusion of\nparity packets is measured in terms of the stretch factor, SF,\nwhich is the ratio n\/k. The reader is referred to [4] for options\navailable with regards to the function ri.\n3) FEC overhead assignment rule: From the FEC\nperspective, we also have a choice with respect to how FEC\nredundancy is determined for each item in the carousel. We\nrefer to the followed rule as a FEC assignment rule (FAR). In\n[4], we considered small codes and two FARs: fixed SF and\nfixed item success rate (see Fig. 2). In fixed SF, the same SF is\napplied to each item regardless of its size; in fixed item success\nFixed SF: k=2, SF = 1.5\nItem I Item 2\nItem 2 ,\n., Item I Item 2\nPF,IOO50% PF,IOO= 47% 50%\nFixed Pr,,: k=2, SF = 1.5 fbr smallest item, p=50%\nFigure 2.

Analytical investigation scenarios\n1) FEC code use: We compare the performance of the\nintegrated carousel-FEC layer under three scenarios with\nrespect to the FEC code in use:\n* Small FEC codes for every item i: PFI O = PF,I tO i\n* Large FEC codes for every item i: PF,100 PL,00, bi\n* Combined use of small and large codes depending on\nthe length 1i ofitem i:\nif li 2 llh, PF~.IO PF.IOO\nelse pF.IO = PFS.IO\nAs mentioned in section 111, r0 varies with file size. In the\nanalysis herein, this variation is modeled by using the\ndistribution given in Table 1, which is an approximation of the\nsimulation results for one of the LDGM variants presented in\n[7]. It is also assumed that the r0 values, as listed in Table 1, are\nconstant for all valid values ofSF.\nAn item with 1,hr or more packets is fed into the large codec.\nThe value lthr corresponds to the file size, where both the small\nand large codecs require the same SF to achieve a given file\nsuccess rate. Beyond 1,hr, the large codec is always more\nefficient than the small one, since the increased error correcting\ncapabilities resulting from encoding over a single data block,\noutweigh the overhead due to the non-zero r0. The use of a\nscheme employing a small or large FEC codec, hereafter called\na hybrid codec, necessitates the determination of 'zhr. Table II\nand the plots in Fig. 3 illustrate the impact of p on the\nperformance difference between small and large codes. At very\nlowp, small codes outperform large codes over the full file size\nrange considered in Fig. 3, rendering 1,hr irrelevant.\nTABLE I.

At high values of\nP, I,hr is smaller (lthr = 92 when p = 40%) and the performance\ngain of large codes over small codes is more significant. This\nbehavior is in alignment with the simulation results in [8],\nwhich also indicate that asp grows, the efficiency gain of large\ncodes over small codes increases while 'thr decreases.\n2) Distributions for item demand and item length: the item\ndemand is based on the Zipf function shown in Table III, where\nthe parameter 0 determines the nature of the distribution. An\nitem is assigned its length and demand probability by\nsuperimposing the two distributions.\n3) Item retrieval and FARs: in [4], the differences in\nperformance between 1-shot and cumulative item retrieval as\nwell as between fixed-SF and fixed item success rate FARs\nwere shown to be minimal. In the following, the 1-shot item\nretrieval approach and the fixed SF FAR are used.\n4) Packet loss distribution amongst users: we consider two\nscenarios with respect to packet loss distribution amongst the\nuser population: homogeneous and heterogeneous.\nB. Homogeneous loss scenario\nIn this scenario, we assumed a uniform probability oferrorp\nfor all users, namely PD is the same for all users. Fig. 4\ndepicts typical results of Sr versus SF: without FEC, the\nresponse time is very high; as SF grows, the response time\nbecomes shorter, due to better error correction capability, until\na minimum is reached. Beyond this minimum, additional\nredundancy is counterproductive since the effect of longer\nitems (caused by increasing SF) dominates over the error\ncorrection capability. It is also interesting to note that at very\nlow SF values, the large scheme is outperformed by the small\none; this is a key characteristic of the two codes since at these\nSF values, the penalty induced by r, is greater than the penalty\ndue to splitting some items into a number ofFEC blocks.\nAs listed in Table IV, at the optimum points the best hybrid\nscheme shows a 4% gain in SF and a lower response time by\nabout 127 slots compared to the small scheme when p = 100\/0.\nWith respect to the large scheme, the hybrid approach has 2%\ngain in capacity and a lower response time by about 92 slots. In\nthe settings used to plot Fig. 4, the item size varies uniformly in\nmultiples of k (=50) from 50 to 500. Given lthr = 150 at p =\n10%, the bulk of items in the carousel are classified as large;\nhence, the overall performance gain of the hybrid scheme over\nthe large scheme is not as substantial as its gain over the small\nscheme. As can be seen from Table IV, wherever 1thr exists\nwithin range, the hybrid scheme always outperforms the other\ntwo schemes. Although, the hybrid scheme offers no advantage\nin capacity at high values ofp, e.g. p = 400\/o, it still manages to\noffer a lower response time compared to the large scheme. In\nthe case where the majority of the items are small, i.e. at low\nvalues ofp, the small codec outperforms the large codec and\neven the hybrid codec. The deduction of whether the majority\nof the items are small or large depends on p which determines\nIthr. Furthermore, in the case where the majority of the items\ncan be classified as large, the extent of the majority matters,\ni.e., it determines whether or not the small codec beats the large\ncodec, because small codes have a substantial advantage on\nvery small files.\nFor mobile satellite systems, typical packet loss rates can be\nin excess of 10%, which is the region where the hybrid scheme\nis particularly effective as shown by the results in Table IV. At\nthese high packet loss rates, the hybrid scheme is also sensitive\nto the value of lthr. If this threshold is carelessly chosen e.g. lthr\n= 300 at p = 40% when the correct value given by the\ncharacterization is Ithr = 100, a significant rise in both the\ncapacity consumed and the user response time can be observed.\nThese results are consistent for other combinations of demand\nand length distributions, not reported here due to space\nlimitations.\n1.4 1.6 1.8\nFEC stretch factor, SF\nFigure 4.

Heterogeneous loss scenario\nIn this more realistic scenario, we assumed that users are\nequally distributed in different environments; each\nenvironment having its own unique value of PD. We also\nassumed that there are so many users that the item demand\nprobability distribution is constant across all the environments.\nIt can be seen from Table V that using the SF derived from the\noptimum, weighted average of the user response time (4970\nslots), leads to suboptimal results with respect to each\nenvironment; moreover, the users that suffer most are the ones\nwith a lower p as they see a dramatic rise in the response time\nwith respect to their ideal carousel-FEC settings.\nAlthough the resulting response times are suboptimal from\nthe user's perspective, they still provide an improvement at\nnetwork level, because there is a 4% capacity gain and a gain\nof about 200 slots compared to a carousel-FEC designed for the\nworst case i.e., p = 40%. To reduce the penalty incurred by\nusers in good conditions, the careful use of multiple channels\nhas to be considered. From the user's perspective, the best case\nwould be to have several channels, each with carousel-FEC\nsettings specific to one environment. However, from the\nnetwork's viewpoint this approach might be deemed resource\ninefficient. The trick is to find an optimal balance between\nresource consumption and user satisfaction (download time).\nTABLE V.

CONCLUSIONS\nWe have studied the use of small and large codes within the\ncontext of the integrated carousel-FEC layer, first introduced in\n[4], considering two scenarios for packet loss distribution\namongst users, homogeneous and heterogeneous.\nIn the homogeneous scenario, the hybrid scheme, which\nfeeds an item into either the small or large codec depending on\nits size, outperforms the small and large scheme in terms of\nresource consumption and\/or download times at packet loss\nrates of 10% and beyond, which are met for mobile satellite\nlinks. In the heterogeneous case, the use of carousel-FEC\nparameters corresponding to a minimum for the weighted\naverage download time was shown to be punitive for users in\ngood conditions. However, these mean parameters offered\ngains over a system designed for the worst-case reception\nconditions.\nIn the future, ways of reducing the penalty observed by good\nusers in heterogeneous environments shall be investigated\nstarting from the careful use of multiple channels. The current\nanalytical work shall also be complemented by simulations.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M. Chipeta, M. Karaliopoulos, B.G. Evans, B. Gamier, and L.
