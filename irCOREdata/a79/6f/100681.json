INTRODUCTION\nNuclei close to double shell closures offer an ideal envi-\nronment for testing realistic shell-model calculations as these\nnuclei have a particularly simple structure: just a few particles\nor holes outside an inert core. Isomeric states are abundant\nin Sn isotopes with a few neutron holes away from 132Sn.\nThey are typically formed by yrast spin traps and allow the\n*Radomira.Lozeva@csnsm.in2p3.fr\nobservation of decay cascades in exotic nuclei. Such isomeric\nstates exist because of the short-range, repulsive character\nof the nucleon-nucleon interaction for alike nucleons, which\nleads to small level spacings between the highest-spin states of\na multiplet where the wave functions of the nucleons are not\nallowed to reach maximum overlap due to the Pauli principle.\nThe unique-parity h11\/2 neutron-hole orbital, which lies close\nto the Fermi surface, is responsible for exactly this type of\nisomerism in nuclei near 132Sn with N < 82.\nTo date, intermediate-spin states have been observed, in the\nSn isotopes at, or a few neutrons away from, stability by using\n0556-2813\/2008\/77(6)\/064313(15) 064313-1 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society\nR. L. LOZEVA et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 064313 (2008)\ndeep-inelastic reactions [1\u20134]. Further away from stability, Sn\nnuclei and their vicinity have been studied by using relativistic\nfission [5\u20137] and fragmentation [8,9] reactions. Intermediate-\nspin states were observed either directly after in-flight mass\nseparation of \u00b5s isomeric states, produced by thermal neutron-\ninduced fission [10\u201312], or by the \u03b2 decay of intermediate-spin\nlong-lived (seconds) In isomers [13,14]. The aforementioned\nexperiments have allowed the complete \u03bdh\u2212n11\/2, seniority v = 2\nmultiplet to be measured for even-mass Sn isotopes in the mass\nrange A = 116\u2013130. In these nuclei the filling of the h11\/2\norbital is not isolated. The presence of, for example, the close\nlying d3\/2 orbital leads to a delayed filling of the h11\/2 orbital\nas nucleons can scatter into it. The filling of the lower half of\nthe h11\/2 orbital could well be enhanced due to scattering from\nthe lower lying g7\/2, d5\/2, s1\/2 orbitals, which in total leads\nto deviations from the symmetric B(E2) trend in an isolated\nhigh-spin orbital [15,16].\nIn addition to the v = 2 states, \u03bdh\u2212n11\/2, v = 3 isomeric\nstates were also observed by using deep-inelastic reactions for\n119,121,123Sn [2]. These isomers, however, were not observed\nin the more neutron-rich Sn isotopes using fission reactions,\nas \u03b2 decay cannot populate such high-spin states and their\npredicted lifetime of \u223c200 ns is below the observational\nlimit of the Lohengrin mass spectrometer at the ILL, where\nthe flight time is around 2 \u00b5s [10]. Valuable information\nabout intermediate-spin states in the heavy odd Sn nuclei was\nhowever obtained from the decay of \u03bdh\u2212211\/2d\n\u22121\n3\/2 \u00b5s isomeric\nstates [10\u201312]. In order to complete the systematic data for\nthe \u03bdh\u2212n11\/2, v = 3 isomers, to see whether their B(E2) values\nfit into the trend of the v = 2 isomers, and to gain more\ninformation on intermediate-spin states in these nuclei, data\nfrom a recent experimental campaign using relativistic fission\nor fragmentation performed at the fragment separator (FRS) at\nGSI [17] were examined, where the flight time of the reaction\nproducts was around 300 ns.\nThe new isomeric states were interpreted by using shell-\nmodel calculations performed with a realistic interaction\nderived from the CD-Bonn nucleon-nucleon potential [18].\nA good description of the experimental data is found from\nusing an effective neutron charge of en = 0.70e, in agreement\nwith previous work in this region [19,20], and at variance with\nthe larger values found in Refs. [3,12,21]. The experimental\nmethod and results are introduced in Secs. II and III, respec-\ntively, followed by an interpretation of these results in terms\nof probable configurations of the states involved in the decay\nsequence in Sec. IV.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nDelayed \u03b3 rays from neutron-rich Sn isotopes were ob-\nserved at the final focal point of the FRS [17] by using\neight Cluster detectors [22] from the RISING array [23]. The\nexperimental setup, shown schematically in Fig. 1(a), was used\nfor the study of g factors of \u00b5s isomeric states as part of the\ng-RISING campaign [24].\nThe Sn nuclei were produced in two separate experimental\nruns: by relativistic projectile fission of a 750 A\u00b7MeV 238U\nbeam, with an intensity of \u223c8 \u00d7 107 ions\/s impinging on\na 1023 mg\/cm2 Be primary target (with Nb backing of\n221 mg\/cm2), and by the fragmentation of a 136Xe beam, with\nan intensity of \u223c2 \u00d7 108 ions\/s impinging on the same target\nat 600 A\u00b7MeV [25].\nThe reaction products were identified by the FRS, which\nwas set up in a standard achromatic configuration [17].\nMass identification of the ions was performed by an event-\nby-event measurement of the magnetic rigidity (B\u03c1) at the\ndispersive (middle) focal plane and the velocity, determined in\na time-of-flight (ToF) measurement by using position-sensitive\nscintillators placed at middle (Sc1) and final (Sc2) focuses\nof the spectrometer. Z determination was performed by\nmeasurements of the energy loss in an ionization chamber\n(MUSIC), while (x, y) tracking of the ions was achieved by\nusing two multiwire proportional counters (MW1 and MW2).\nIons entering the gap of the magnet used for g-factor studies\nwere also detected by a scintillation detector (validation),\nwhose signal was required for the acceptance of an ion-\u03b3\ncoincidence event in the analysis. The ions, after being slowed\nthrough 15 mm of Plexiglass, were stopped in a 2 mm thick Cu\ncatcher placed at the center of the magnet\u2019s poles. A scintillator\n(veto) placed behind the catcher was used to reject ions passing\nthrough it. To adjust the implantation depth in the Cu foil a\nvariable-thickness Al degrader was used at the final focus.\nThe Ge detector setup, where all Cluster detectors were\nplaced in the horizontal plane shown in Fig. 1(a), had a \u03b3 -ray\ndetection efficiency of 2.2% at 500 keV and 1.8% at 1.3 MeV.\nAdd-back of up to three (out of seven) neighboring crystals\nin each Cluster was performed, chosen after a study of the\nbest peak\/background ratio. A time restriction for prompt \u03b3\nrays for single crystals with Cluster multiplicity one was used\nin the analysis. Wider time and multiplicity restrictions were\nperformed for the add-back energies. Half of the detectors were\nused with their BGO anti-Compton suppression shields [26]\nin place. To suppress the low-energy atomic bremsstrahlung\nassociated with the arrival of the beam [23], all detector faces\nwere covered by Cu and Pb absorbers, each 1 mm thick. This\nprovided a useful \u03b3 -ray energy detection range of between\n\u223c140 keV and \u223c4 MeV, the upper limit being due to the\nselected ADC range of the used Euroball VXI cards. Ion-\u03b3\ncoincidences were accepted up to 15.4 \u00b5s after the arrival of\nan ion and were measured by using a common TAC, started by\nthe first \u03b3 ray measured in any of the Ge detectors, and stopped\nby a delayed signal from scintillator Sc2. Times between the\nfirst \u03b3 ray, detected within the ion-\u03b3 time window, and any\nother coincident \u03b3 rays were measured by a TDC, which had a\nrange of 1.2 \u00b5s. The constant fraction discriminators (CFDs)\nof the Ge detectors were inhibited for the first 300 ns after the\narrival of an ion to avoid the TDC time window being opened\nby the prompt atomic bremsstrahlung from the beam. The time\nresolution of the Ge detectors was \u223c20 ns.\nElectronics effects such as the blocking effect of the Ge\ndetectors\u2019 CFDs and the sharp end of the coincidence gate for\nparticles and \u03b3 rays limit the useful range for time analysis\nto between 800 ns and 14.6 \u00b5s, respectively. During the sup-\npression of the prompt background (BG) radiation in the first\nfew hundreds of nanoseconds, when the Ge detectors\u2019 CFDs\nrecover, a short-lived isomeric radiation can be observed more\nclearly and with a higher intensity. Therefore, this time range\n064313-2\nNEW SUB-\u00b5s ISOMERS IN 125,127,129Sn AND . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 064313 (2008)\nFIG. 1.

Notes about the background\nBecause of the high bombarding energies, the large amount\nof material close to the detectors (electromagnet), and the\nhigh ion rates (typically \u223c5 \u00d7 103 ions\/s) the nuclear BG\ndetected in the Ge detectors is rather high. Over short time\nranges the main contribution to the BG comes from (n, \u03b3 )\nreactions in the Ge or\/and the surrounding materials (Fe\nand Al) including the catcher itself (Cu). Most of these\ncontributions are prompt, however, a certain amount persists at\nlonger times. Additionally, the photopeaks at low \u03b3 -ray energy\n\u201csit\u201d on a continuous BG from Compton scattering of higher\nenergy \u03b3 rays. Therefore, an accurate background subtraction\nis important for the analysis.

L. LOZEVA et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 064313 (2008)\nodd-A nuclei [see, e.g., Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)] are cleaned of\nthese BG contributions (present in the energy spectra of all\nnuclei) by subtracting a normalized portion from their even-A\nneighbors, whereas for the coincidence \u03b3 -ray spectra [see,\ne.g., Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)] a subtraction of the BG for the\ntotal energy projection is performed by using the methods\ndescribed in Refs. [27,28]. The time structure of the BG is\ninvestigated over the entire energy range. Such an analysis\nreveals a mean half-life of 0.33(4) \u00b5s, dominated mostly by\nthe short-lived neutron-knockout activities. Therefore, a proper\nBG subtraction is essential. The experimental procedure was\nverified for several long-lived BG activities, for example, for\nthe 198.4 keV line in 71Ge (T1\/2 = 20.4 ms [29,30]) and the\n1460.9 keV line in 40K (T1\/2 = 1.25 \u00d7 109 yr [31]) and, as\nexpected, a constant time spectrum is observed.\nThe data analysis was performed by using SPY\/CRACOW\n[32], ROOT [33], and the RADWARE [34] packages.\nB. Odd-mass Sn nuclei\nThe isotopic identification of the Sn nuclei transmitted by\nthe FRS is depicted in Fig. 1(b), where the atomic number Z is\nrepresented as a function of the mass\/charge ratio (A\/q). The\nspectrometer was tuned to optimally select 126Sn, leading to a\nsimilar but reduced production and transmission of 125,127Sn\nas well. The ToF measurement with Sc1 [Fig. 1(a)] was influ-\nenced by the high ion rates at the middle focus of the separator,\nwhich led to slightly overlapping distributions for the neigh-\nboring isotopes. Therefore, the corresponding contaminations\nof the odd Sn isotopes were removed in the analysis by\nsubtracting a normalized portion from their even neighbors.\nThe relativistic fission and fragmentation reactions can\npopulate high-spin states. Their decay proceeds toward states\nnear the yrast line, some of which can be \u00b5s isomers in the Sn\nregion. In the following sections we confirm the \u00b5s lifetimes\nof known isomers in 125,127,129Sn and report on a new sub-\u00b5s\nisomer in each of these isotopes.\n1. 125Sn\nA new (23\/2+) isomer has been observed in 125Sn,\nalong with the previously known 0.23(3) \u00b5s (27\/2\u2212) and\n6.2(7) \u00b5s 19\/2+ isomeric states reported in Refs. [1] and\n[10], respectively. The decay schemes of these isomers are\nconfirmed in this work and four new transitions are added\nto the decay cascade out of the (27\/2\u2212) isomer. The \u03b3 -ray\nspectrum in Fig. 2(a) shows the observed transitions in 125Sn\nin a time window from 200 ns to 1 \u00b5s after the arrival of the ion\nfrom the fission data set. It represents a BG-subtracted energy\nspectrum, taken shortly after the implantation, for which the\ncontribution deduced from an equal time region at the end of\nthe time range is canceled. The BG contributions are subtracted\nas explained in Sec. III A. As a result, the only remaining peak,\nnot belonging to 125Sn, that could not be fully removed by the\nBG subtraction comes from the strong short-lived 691.4 keV\n72Ge(n, \u03b3 ) transition [35].\nA BG-subtracted spectrum in a time range from 2 to 14 \u00b5s\nfrom the same data set is presented in Fig. 2(b). All \u03b3 rays in\nthe spectrum belong to the known decay of the 19\/2+ isomer\nin 125Sn [10].\nHalf-lives of 0.23(2) and 6.2(2) \u00b5s are determined for\nthe (27\/2\u2212) and 19\/2+ states, respectively, by using only\nthe strongest transitions in the cascades for the lifetime\ndeterminations.\nThe (23\/2+) state has already been observed as an isomer\nin the neighboring 123,127,129Sn nuclei [2,12,36]. Two previous\nexperiments [1,10] studying 125Sn at intermediate spin were\nunable to observe the (23\/2+) isomer due to poor particle\nidentification and a lack of statistics, respectively.\nThe four newly observed \u03b3 rays of energies 154, 167, 403,\nand 415 keV are seen in Fig. 2(a). One has to note that these\ntransitions have not been reported in the previous work for\nthe (27\/2\u2212) isomer in this nucleus [1], where only the direct\ndepopulation of the (27\/2\u2212) state, through the negative-parity\nstates, could be observed.\nThe \u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidence relations from the current work are\nshown in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d). They are performed for the\nfirst 2 \u00b5s of the time window after a BG subtraction (see\nSec. III A). The coincidences with known transitions represent\nthe corresponding feeding of the short-lived isomer and the\nconsecutive decay of the longer lived one. By setting gates\nin a \u03b3 -time matrix, to extract time information about the new\ntransitions, and also by observing the \u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidences it was\npossible to associate the 154, 403, and 415 keV transitions\nwith the decay cascade out of the 0.23(2) \u00b5s (27\/2\u2212) isomer\nalone and the 167 keV transition with the decay out of another\nlower lying isomer. The 154 keV \u03b3 ray is in coincidence with\nthe 415 keV transition [Fig. 2(c)]. If the sum of these two\n\u03b3 -ray energies is added to the energy of the 1894 keV 19\/2+\nisomer an energy of 2463 keV is obtained, the same as that of\nthe (23\/2\u2212) state reported in Ref. [1]. The 154 keV transition\nis associated with the decay out of the (23\/2\u2212) level and the\n415 keV with the decay of a (21\/2+) state [see Sec. IV B1].\nThe newly observed 167 keV transition has a half-life\nof 0.6(2) \u00b5s [Fig. 3(b)], which is inconsistent with any of\nthe known isomers in this nucleus. This transition is also in\ncoincidence with the 403 keV \u03b3 ray [Fig. 2(d)]. The sum of\nthese two transitions and the 1894 keV 19\/2+ isomer also\ngives 2464 keV, which is the energy of (23\/2\u2212) state from\nRef. [1]. The 403 keV transition is therefore postulated to be\nanother decay out of the (23\/2\u2212) level.\nThe ground state (g.s.) 1088 keV transition in the fission\ndata was fitted with three decay components [in the inset of\nFig. 3(b)], consistent with the three observed isomeric decays\nin 125Sn. It is interesting to note that the strong direct decay of\nthe (27\/2\u2212) isomer is visible from the pronounced hump at the\nbeginning of the spectrum. This decay branch is considerably\nreduced in the heavier Sn isotopes as, for example, visible\nfrom the decay curve for the 1095 keV transition in 127Sn\n[in the inset of Fig. 3(d)] and the 1136 + 570 keV transitions\nin 129Sn [Fig. 3(f)]. A detailed comparison of the isomeric\npopulation from both fission and fragmentation data sets will\nbe the subject of a forthcoming article.\n2. 127Sn\nIsomeric 19\/2+ and 23\/2+ states with half-lives of 4.5(3)\nand 1.26(15) \u00b5s, respectively, were previously reported in\n064313-4\nNEW SUB-\u00b5s ISOMERS IN 125,127,129Sn AND . . .

The decay\ncurves of the g.s. transitions in the three nuclei are shown in the insets of (b) and (d) and in (f).\nRefs. [10,36]. The decay scheme of the 19\/2+ isomer is con-\nfirmed in this work, although the 23\/2+ isomer decaying by a\n104 keV isomeric transition was not observed due to the low\nefficiency of the Ge detector setup at such low \u03b3 -ray energies.\nIn addition to these two isomers in 127Sn, a new (27\/2\u2212) isomer\nwith a half-life of 0.25(3) \u00b5s and four associated delayed\n\u03b3 rays at energies of 142, 363, 480, and 952 keV are seen in\nthis work. All new transitions are present in the BG-subtracted\nenergy spectrum, taken shortly after the implantation (similar\nto 125Sn) in Fig. 4(a), which represents data from both 238U\nfission and 136Xe fragmentation. This isomer was not observed\nin previous isomer studies of this nucleus [10], due to its short\nhalf-life, and was not populated in \u03b2-decay studies [36], due\nto its high spin.\nThe four newly observed transitions can be assigned to\nthe decay cascade of a new (27\/2\u2212) isomer by measurements\nof their half-lives [Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)] and observations of\n\u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidences [Figs. 4(c)\u20134(e)], which also permitted the\nlevel scheme construction. The new 2410 keV level is obtained\nby summing the 363, 952, and known 1095 keV transitions,\nwhich are observed in mutual coincidence. The 363 and\n952 keV \u03b3 rays have similar intensities (see Table I). The\nsum of the 1931 keV 23\/2+ isomeric level and the new\n480 keV transition also gives a similarly consistent energy\nof 2411 keV. Note that a 952 keV transition was observed\nin \u03b2-decay studies [36] and placed in the decay scheme\nin a cascade with the 1095 keV transition. However, no\nspin-parity (I\u03c0 ) suggestions for this state were made. The\nnewly observed 142 keV transition is in coincidence with all\nother new transitions [Fig. 4(c)] and is very likely the isomeric\n(27\/2\u2212) \u2192 (23\/2\u2212) transition. The extended level scheme for\n127Sn is shown in Fig. 3(b) and is discussed in Sec. IV B2.\n3. 129Sn\nTwo new \u03b3 rays of 145 and 605 keV have been observed\nin the BG-subtracted energy spectrum for 129Sn, taken shortly\nafter the implantation [Fig. 5(a)], in the same way as those\nfor 125Sn and 127Sn. The data from both 238U fission and\n136Xe fragmentation experiments were added to obtain better\nstatistics. As in 125Sn, the only remaining peak, not belonging\nto 129Sn, comes from the strong short-lived 691.4 keV line\n72Ge(n, \u03b3 ) [35], which could not be perfectly subtracted.\nThe two newly observed transitions are assigned to the\ndecay of a new 0.27(7) \u00b5s (27\/2\u2212) isomer [Fig. 3(e)]. Because\nof the thick absorbers and the low efficiency of the setup at\nenergies around 140 keV the half-life of this isomer could be\nextracted only from the 605 keV transition after an appropriate\nBG subtraction. The obtained result was in addition verified\nby using a double exponential fit for the non-BG subtracted\ndata to account for the exponential BG present at short times\n064313-5\nR. L. LOZEVA et al.

[12,36]\nare confirmed here, though the low-energy decays of the\n3.6(2) \u00b5s 19\/2+ isomer (19.7 keV) and the 2.4(2) \u00b5s\n23\/2+ isomer (41.0 keV) were not observed. A BG-subtracted\nenergy spectrum from the end of the time range (as for 125Sn\nand 127Sn) is presented in Fig. 5(b). All \u03b3 rays labeled with\ntheir energy belong to the known decay of the 19\/2+ isomer\nin 129Sn [12].\nDue to the lack of statistics for this nucleus a summed\ncoincidence spectrum was constructed with gates on all\nknown (and the new 605 keV) transitions [Fig. 5(c)]. In this\nspectrum, the 145 keV transition is clearly visible, support-\ning its placement as (27\/2\u2212) \u2192 (23\/2\u2212) in analogy to the\n142 and 161 keV transitions in 127Sn and 125Sn, respectively.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThe half-lives obtained in the current data set are compared\nwith the existing data in Table I, where one can notice a\ngood agreement. The measured energies of all observed \u03b3 -ray\ntransitions and their absolute intensities, normalized to the\nmost intense one for each nucleus, are listed for each isomeric\nstate.\nAdditionally, all \u00b5s isomers in the even-A 124,126,128,130Sn\nisotopes were remeasured. The half-lives obtained for the\n10+, 7\u2212 (in 124,126Sn), and 5\u2212 (in 124Sn) isomeric states are\nfully in agreement with the literature values [1,3,11,13,37].\nTherefore, the lifetimes in the even Sn isotopes are used only\nfor the odd-even renormalization of the reduced transition\nprobabilities (see Sec. IV E).\nA. Shell-model calculations\nShell-model (SM) calculations are performed in a model\nspace p1\/2, g9\/2 for protons and g7\/2, s1\/2, d5\/2, d3\/2, h11\/2 for\nneutrons outside an inert 88Sr core. Therefore, proton-core\nexcitations across Z = 50 and neutron-core excitations across\nN = 82 are not considered in this approach. The polarization\nby proton-core excitations for a well-tuned realistic interaction\nhas a negligible impact on the level energies, but its effect on\nthe \u03b3 -ray transition rates, in general, comprises the use of\neffective operators.

Level schemes\nIn Fig. 6 we present the extended level schemes, including\nthe newly observed isomeric levels and their decay paths.\nNewly observed \u03b3 lines are indicated by asterisks. This is\ndiscussed further below for each case.\n1. 125Sn\nThe newly observed isomeric \u03b3 transitions of 154, 167,\n403, and 415 keV in 125Sn are placed in the extended level\nscheme, presented in Fig. 6(a), by using lifetime analysis and\ncoincidence relations. Based on that, we suggest a new isomer\nof I\u03c0 = (23\/2+), thus completing the (23\/2+) systematics\nfrom 123Sn [2] to 127,129Sn [36]. The measured half-life is\nin agreement with an E2 decay to the 19\/2+ state from\nWeisskopf estimates (WE) and SM considerations and we\nplace this level at 167 keV above the 19\/2+ state. The other\nnewly observed transitions correspond to the decay of the\n(27\/2\u2212) isomer toward the positive-parity states through two\nnew intermediate states of I\u03c0 = (21\/2+) and I\u03c0 = (23\/2+).\nThe (19\/2\u22121,2) states, suggested in Ref. [1], are consistent with\nour measurement.\nThe proposed level scheme is in full agreement with the\nSM calculations (Sec. IV A). The theoretical SM states for\n125,127,129Sn are compared with the experimental ones in\nFig. 7 for both positive and negative parities. A good agreement\nis visible for the three nuclei of interest. In Figs. 7(a)\u20137(c)\none can see that three of the states are candidates for yrast\nspin traps: 19\/2+, 23\/2+, and 27\/2\u2212. The highest spin yrast\ntrap 27\/2\u2212 is populated directly in the reaction, whereas\nthe other isomers are populated both directly and indirectly\nby feeding from the top isomer, which is consistent with\nour lifetime measurements. As can be seen, for example, in\nFig. 7(a), where the decay path is represented by full arrows,\nthe decay from the 27\/2\u2212 trap is possible only by a low-energy\nE2 transition to the 23\/2\u2212 state with a half-life of about\n9\/2 11\/2 13\/2 15\/2 17\/2 19\/2 21\/2 23\/2 25\/2 27\/2 29\/2\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\n125Sn\nE\nne\nrg\ny \n(M\neV\n)\nSpin\ntheoretical +\u03c0\ntheoretical -\u03c0\nexperimental +\u03c0\nexperimental -\u03c0\n9\/2 11\/2 13\/2 15\/2 17\/2 19\/2 21\/2 23\/2 25\/2 27\/2 29\/2\nSpin\n9\/2 11\/2 13\/2 15\/2 17\/2 19\/2 21\/2 23\/2 25\/2 27\/2 29\/2\nSpin\n127Sn 129Sn\n(a) (b) (c)\ng.s. g.s. g.s.\nyrast traps\nyrast traps yrast traps\nFIG. 7.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 064313 (2008)\n200 ns, as indeed reported in Ref. [1] and observed in this work\n(see Table I). Due to the energy gap between the 23\/2\u2212 and the\n23\/2+ states, the isomeric decay proceeds most probably by an\nE1 branch toward the positive-parity states. The de-excitation\nof the 23\/2+ state favors an E2 transition to the 19\/2+ state,\ntheoretically expected to be of 161 keV (from the SM energy\nlevel differences), which is experimentally found to be of\n167 keV. The theoretically estimated half-life for this state is\nof the order of 500 ns, which agrees well with the experimental\nvalue of 0.6(2) \u00b5s. The decay from the 19\/2+ state proceeds\nthrough the 15\/2+ state as well as the low-lying 13\/2\u2212 and\n15\/2\u2212 states, as already known from the literature [10].\n2. 127Sn\nAll new isomeric transitions (142, 363, 480, and 952 keV)\nin 127Sn, presented in Fig. 6(b), have the same half-life of\n0.25(3) \u00b5s, in agreement with the expected value of about\n200 ns [10] for a new (27\/2\u2212) isomer in this nucleus. The\n142 keV transition is coincident with all other transitions\n[Fig. 4(c)] and its energy is in agreement with an E2 decay to\nthe (23\/2\u2212) state from WE and SM considerations. This tran-\nsition was also suggested semiempirically to be of the order of\n135(2) keV [10]. The cascade out of the new (27\/2\u2212) isomer\nis analogous to that in 125Sn. The intensities of all isomeric\ndecays however are distributed differently than those in the\nlighter Sn nuclei. The suggested experimental states in the\nproposed level scheme [Fig. 6(b)] match the theoretical SM\nstates well, as can be seen in Fig. 7(b).\n3. 129Sn\nThe new isomeric \u03b3 transitions of 145 and 605 keV in 129Sn\nare placed in the extended level scheme, presented in Fig. 6(c),\nby using lifetime analysis and coincidence relations. Thus, the\nnew isomer of I\u03c0 = (27\/2\u2212) completes the systematics of\nknown (27\/2\u2212) states from 119Sn [2] to 129Sn [36].\nA comparison with the SM calculation (Sec. IV B) and\nempirical shell-model (ESM) estimates suggests that the\n145 keV transition is very likely responsible for the isomerism\nwhereas the 605 keV transition is assigned as the decay from\nthe (23\/2\u2212) state to the 23\/2+ state. In the ESM, if we assume\npure hn11\/2 configurations, the relative positions of the 23\/2\u2212\nand 27\/2\u2212 states in 129Sn can be calculated from the known\n6+ to 10+ states in 130Sn (see, e.g., Refs. [4,10,15]). The\nresult for the 27\/2\u2212 \u2192 23\/2\u2212 transition energy is 135(2) keV\n(the same as for 127Sn), where the systematic uncertainty\nis estimated from the configurational purity of the high-\nspin states involved in the full shell-model calculation. The\n145 keV \u03b3 ray is the only candidate in that energy range seen\nin Fig. 5(a). This was confirmed in a follow-up experiment\nemploying fragmentation of 136Xe and a more efficient detector\nsetup [43].\nThe 145 keV transition is placed at the top of the level\nscheme, suggesting that the new isomer of I\u03c0 = (27\/2\u2212)\ndecays analogously to the ones in the lighter Sn nuclei, which\nis indeed expected from WE and SM predictions.\nAn E2 cascade out of the (23\/2\u2212) state can be suggested\nbased on an ESM estimate in the spirit of Ref. [10], with the full\nshell-model calculation and extrapolations from systematics to\nbe of 307 and 929 keV (with a similar uncertainty as for the\npredicted 135 keV transition) for the 23\/2\u2212 \u2192 19\/2\u2212 and\nthe 19\/2\u2212 \u2192 15\/2\u2212 transitions, respectively. Following the\nintensity distribution of the isomeric decays in the lighter\nodd-A neighbors, the observation of this cascade would require\nbetter statistics. Assuming the SM E2 decay energy and\nreduced transition strengths equal to 127Sn would increase the\nE1(605 keV)\/E2(307 keV) branching by at least a factor of\n5 relative to 127Sn.\nThe suggested experimental states in the proposed level\nscheme [Fig. 6(c)] match the theoretical SM states quite well,\nas can be seen in Fig. 7(c). Thus, the decay of the (27\/2\u2212)\nisomer seems to be shifted toward the positive-parity states\nthrough the 605 keV transition. This is supported by the energy\ndifferences between the theoretically calculated states in\nFig. 7(c), where the energy gap between the 23\/2\u2212 \u2192\n23\/2+ states is larger than the one between the 23\/2\u2212 \u2192\n19\/2\u2212 states. The intensity of the 605 keV (E1) transi-\ntion is also consistent with the increasing intensity of the\nbranch toward the heavier masses, following the trend from\n125,127Sn.\nIn conclusion, the following points summarize the decay of\nthe three \u00b5s isomers in 125,127,129Sn:\n(i) The (27\/2\u2212) isomers decay through E2 cascades\ntoward the negative-parity states in the lighter Sn nuclei.\nThese branches become very weak as A increases.\n(ii) The decay path via E1 transitions from the (23\/2\u2212) to\nthe (23\/2+) levels toward the positive-parity states is\nenhanced, as the energy spacing between these states\nalso increases with A.\n(iii) The energies of the E2 transitions from the (27\/2\u2212)\nto the (23\/2\u2212) levels stay almost constant, reflecting\nsimilar isomeric half-lives and pure configurations,\nwhereas the excitation energy of the 27\/2\u2212 isomer is\nlowered toward N = 82.\n(iv) The E2-transition energies of the (23\/2+) \u2192 19\/2+\nde-excitation decrease with increasing A, whereas\nthe 19\/2+ \u2192 15\/2+ transition energy stays nearly\nconstant.\n(v) The intensity distribution of the decays from the 19\/2+\nstates differs significantly in the lower masses, where\nthe feeding to the 15\/2\u2212 states is almost equally\ncontributed to by transitions from the 19\/2+ and 15\/2+\nstates.\n(vi) In the heavier odd-A Sn nuclei, de-excitations from\nthe 15\/2+ states only are favored as the energy for a\n19\/2+ \u2192 15\/2\u2212 transition decreases.\n(vii) Although in the lighter odd-A Sn isotopes the branches\ninvolving the 13\/2\u2212 states are weak, in the heavier\nA nuclei, these branches become dominant and even\ncomparable with the branches involving the 15\/2\u2212\nstates.\nC.

According to the SM calculations, these states are\nthe highest members of the h\u2212311\/2 quasiparticle multiplet. For\nA = 129 the h\u2212311\/2 probabilities in the wave functions are 100%\nand 99.5%, respectively. For the lighter isotopes the weights\nof the pure h\u2212n11\/2 configurations, with n = 132 \u2212 A, reduce\nto 32.4% and 28.4% for 127Sn and 11.5% and 11.7% for\n125Sn due to pair scattering from the positive-parity g, d, s\norbitals. As seniority is a good quantum number the total\namount of v = 3 in the wave functions is more than 95%.\nThe 23\/2\u2212, 19\/2\u2212, 15\/2\u2212, and 13\/2\u2212 excited states and the\n11\/2\u2212 (g.s.) belong to the same multiplet. The 15\/2\u2212 and\n13\/2\u2212 states have increasing admixtures of d\u221213\/2s\n\u22121\n1\/2h\n\u22121\n11\/2 and\nd\u221215\/2s\n\u22121\n1\/2h\n\u22121\n11\/2 quasiparticle configurations, respectively, which\namount to about 30% and 15% in 129Sn. This reflects the\ncoupling of the h11\/2 particle to the 2+ states in the neighboring\neven isotopes.\n2. 23\/2+ states\nAccording to SM calculations, the yrast trap at spin\n23\/2+ (Fig. 7) has a dominant quasiparticle configuration of\n\u03bdd\u221213\/2h\n\u22122\n11\/2, as discussed in Ref. [36]. In 125Sn the dominant\ncomponent is \u03bdd\u221213\/2h\n\u22124\n11\/2 with 36.4%, while \u03bdd\n\u22123\n3\/2h\n\u22122\n11\/2 con-\ntributes with 22.0%. If only unpaired neutrons are considered,\nthis is indeed the same type of quasiparticle configuration\nas in the heavier Sn, as discussed already in Ref. [36].\nThe leading quasiparticle configuration of \u03bdd\u221213\/2h\n\u22122\n11\/2 in the\nheavier Sn, according to the calculations, has probabilities\nof 64.8% (127Sn) and 97.0% (129Sn). These numbers indicate\nthe increasing purity of these states, as the seniority mixing\ndecreases, toward the filling of all involved orbitals at\nN = 82.\n3. 21\/2+ states\nIn 125Sn we observe a state [Fig. 8(a)] and suggest I\u03c0 =\n(21\/2+) based on the observation of this state in studies of\nthe heavier Sn [36], which is also supported by theoretical\ncalculations. The 2232 and 2275 keV levels [Figs. 8(b) and\n8(c)] were assigned with a spin of (21\/2) in Ref. [36] for A =\n127 and A = 129, respectively. The decay transitions to the\n19\/2+ and 23\/2+ states, shown in Figs. 8(b) and 8(c), are taken\nfrom Ref. [36] and were not observed in the current data set due\nto insufficient statistics. The nonobservation of the branch from\n23\/2\u2212 toward the (21\/2+) state in 129Sn is partly a consequence\nof the increasing energy of the 23\/2\u2212 \u2192 23\/2+ transition,\nwhich is nicely reproduced by the SM calculations, while the\ndistance between the 23\/2\u2212 and 21\/2+ states stays essentially\nconstant. This branch appeared in 125Sn and transported about\n15% of the total intensity from the 23\/2\u2212 state, compared\nto the 30% intensity of the 23\/2\u2212 \u2192 23\/2+ branch. In the\nheavier mass nuclei the intensity is transported through the\nstronger 23\/2\u2212 \u2192 23\/2+ transitions, which take about 76%\n(the 480 keV transition with respect to 363 keV transition)\nfrom the total intensity of the 23\/2\u2212 state in 127Sn and 100%\nin 129Sn (e.g., no branch other than the 605 keV transition is\nobserved). In fact, the branches involving the (21\/2+) states\nmost probably become weaker as the mass increases and better\nstatistics would be required to find out their exact contribution.\nThe 21\/2+1 states have a leading quasiparticle configuration\nof \u03bdd\u221213\/2h\n\u22122\n11\/2 with a contribution of greater than 30% in 125Sn\n[Fig. 8(a)] to above 96% in 129Sn [Fig. 8(c)]. In the 21\/2+2\nstates the configuration involving the \u03bds1\/2 orbital is enhanced\nand dominates (above 98%) in 129Sn. For A = 127 [Fig. 8(b)],\nnevertheless, \u03bdd\u221213\/2 is dominant with 62.6% whereas in the\nlighter 125Sn the d3\/2 and s1\/2 components are 20.5% and\n35.1%, respectively. Note that the increased probability for\nhole excitation involving the d3\/2 orbital atA = 127 is reflected\nin the wave functions of all excited states [Fig. 8(b)].\nD. Level systematics\nThe observation of three new isomers in the odd neutron-\nrich Sn isotopes allows a comparison with the information\navailable on both the even and odd neutron-rich Sn nuclei.\nSuch a plot representing the different origin of the isomeric\nstates and the overall trend in the heavy Sn region is presented\nin Fig. 9(a).\nBecause of the closed proton shell at Z = 50 the decay\nschemes of the Sn nuclei originate mostly from neutron\nexcitations across the subshells between the shell gaps at\nN = 50 and N = 82. The last h11\/2 orbital is strongly involved\nin single particle\/hole excitations, represented by the seniority\nscheme [2,3]. The general features of the decays of the odd\nSn (125,127,129Sn) nuclei are quite similar to each other and to\nthe lighter 119\u2013121Sn, with the exception of 123Sn (N = 73)-the\nhalf-filling point of the h11\/2 neutron orbital [3].\nThe \u00b5s isomeric states present in these nuclei originate\nfrom different configurations:\n064313-10\nNEW SUB-\u00b5s ISOMERS IN 125,127,129Sn AND . . .

(b) Experimental B(E2) values for the total h11\/2 shell. All values in A = 124\u2013130 are obtained\nfrom the current data set. The remaining values are taken from Refs. [2,3]. Note that in the configuration of the 19\/2+ states above N = 73, d3\/2\nand s1\/2 contributions are comparable. Lines in panel (b) are drawn to guide the eye.\n(i) The 19\/2+ isomeric state has been reported in the\nmass chain A = 119\u2013129 [10,11,44] with a dominant\nconfiguration of a h\u2212111\/2 neutron hole orbital coupled\nto the 5\u2212 core of the even Sn neighbor. Note that\nthe 5\u2212 state in the even Sn originates from a domi-\nnant s\u221211\/2h\n\u22121\n11\/2 quasiparticle configuration, confirmed by\ng-factor measurements for the 116,118,120Sn isomers\n[45]. The 5\u2212 states are \u00b5s isomers in 116Sn [46] and\n124Sn [47] only, but these are ns isomers in the other\neven-A118\u2013122,128\u2013130Sn nuclei [48\u201352] because they\ncan decay by E1 transitions to the 4+ states lying just\nbelow them. However, in the odd-A isotopes, the 19\/2+\nstates are all isomeric in the \u00b5s range because each of\nthem comes below the (4+ \u2297 \u03bdh11\/2)17\/2\u2212 and 19\/2\u2212\nstates. Therefore, the decay from these states must\nproceed by an M2 transition to the (2+ \u2297 \u03bdh11\/2)15\/2\u2212\nstate [11]. Note that M2 transitions in this model space\ncan occur only between the orbitals h11\/2 and g7\/2,\nthe latter of which lies deep below the Fermi level.\nAccording to SM calculations [42], the \u0006I = 2 parity\nchanging transitions may have a comparable E3 width\ndue to a h11\/2 \u2192 d5\/2 transition. In Ref. [10] large\nhindrance factors consistent with an M2 multipolarity\nare measured and a weak admixture of h\u2212211\/2g\n\u22121\n7\/2\nwas suggested, in agreement with SM calculations.\nBesides the aforementioned s\u221211\/2h\n\u22121\n11\/2 component the\nSM yields a strong d\u221213\/2h\n\u22121\n11\/2 amplitude in the 19\/2+\nthat increases toward 129Sn. The magnetic moment\nof this isomer in 127Sn has been measured in this\nexperimental campaign, and its result will shed more\nlight on the configuration and the decay of the 19\/2+\nstate in 127Sn [53].\n(ii) The 23\/2+ isomeric state has been previously observed\nin 123Sn [2] and in the heavier 127\u2013129Sn [12,36] nuclei\nwith a leading configuration of a neutron hole in\nthe h11\/2 orbital coupled to the 7\u2212 core of the even\nSn neighbor. All of the 7\u2212 states are isomeric and\nhave mostly d\u221213\/2h\n\u22121\n11\/2 character. These states decay\nby E2 transitions to the 5\u2212 states in the mass range\nA = 118\u2013126. In contrast, in 128Sn and 130Sn, where\nthe 5\u2212 is above the 7\u2212 level, due to a reduced s1\/2\ncomponent in its wave function, the half-lives of\nthe 7\u2212 are well beyond the \u00b5s range. The as-yet\nunobserved 23\/2+ states in the lighter Sn isotopes\nare expected also to follow the trend of the 7\u2212 states\nof their even partners and are a subject of future\nmeasurements.\n(iii) The 27\/2\u2212 isomeric state has been observed in the mass\nrange 119\u2013125Sn [1,2,4] with a pure single-particle h\u2212n11\/2,\nseniority v = 3 configuration and predicted in the heavy\n127\u2013129Sn with a sub-\u00b5s half-life [10].\nThe experimental energy levels from the current work for a\nnew (23\/2+) state in 125Sn and new (27\/2\u2212) states in 127,129Sn\nare added to the systematics [Fig. 9(a)]. One sees a lowering of\nthe excited states toward the doubly magic region. The energy\nspacing between the different states originates most probably\nfrom an admixture in the configurations, where one or another\norbital contribution becomes dominant as, for example, at A =\n127\u2013128 .\nE.

The presence\nof the d3\/2 shell leads to a delayed occupation of the h11\/2 shell\nclose to 132Sn.\nThe reduced E2 transition probabilities of the odd-A Sn\nisotopes, along with the corresponding transitions in the\neven-A nuclei, are compared to each other and SM results in\nFig. 11 and Table II. One has to note that the half-lives\nand B(E2) values of the present work for the even Sn\nisotopes agree well with the literature values [1,10,12,54].\nIn Fig. 11(a) the experimental and SM B(E2) strengths\nfor the h\u2212n11\/2, v = 2 configurations 10+ \u2192 8+ (even A) and\nv = 3 27\/2\u2212 \u2192 23\/2\u2212 (odd A) are compared. The odd-A\nvalues are scaled with a factor 0.264, which accounts for the\ndifferent angular momentum recoupling factors for v = 2 and\nv = 3 configurations and normalizes the odd-A B(E2) values\nto the average of the neighboring even-A strength [56]. In this\nway the trend with decreasing A reflects directly the emptying\nof the h11\/2 orbital [1,4]. The staggering at A = 129 is artificial\nas the normalization is inadequate beyond A = 128. This is\ndue to the presence of the d3\/2 shell, which is emptied first\nbefore the h11\/2 orbital. From the A = 128\u2013130 values one\nmay conclude that the choice of an effective charge of 0.70e,\nas taken from the literature [57], is probably on the low side\nand a value of 0.85e would be more appropriate [13,36]. This\nincrease, however, would not cure the discrepancy observed\ntoward mid-shell, which clearly indicates a too fast emptying\nof the h11\/2 orbital. For 125Sn the leading components of the\n27\/2\u2212 and 23\/2\u2212 wave functions are d\u221223\/2h\n\u22123\n11\/2 and h\n\u22123\n11\/2 with\n45% and 12%, respectively. As the E2 matrix elements in\nthe lowest seniority change sign in mid-shell, which reflects\nthe shape change from prolate to oblate, the contributions of\nthese two configurations interfere destructively. A reduction\nof the minority component to half its value would bring\nthe theoretical value close to experiment. As pointed out in\nSec. IV A, the weak B(E2) values in the h11\/2 mid-shell are\nspecifically sensitive to the neglect of proton-core excitations.\nThis was demonstrated in the N = 50 isotones one major\n064313-12\nNEW SUB-\u00b5s ISOMERS IN 125,127,129Sn AND . . .

B(E2; 5\u2212 \u2192 7\u2212) in 128,130Sn are converted into B(E2; 7\u2212 \u2192\n5\u2212) for better comparison; the odd-A values are scaled by 0.891. The effective neutron charge is 0.70e. SM (squares) and experimental\nB(E2; 2+ \u2192 0+) (circles) [1,21,47,51,52] are shown in (c) for effective charges en = 1.00e (solid line), 0.70e (dashed line), and 0.85e\n(dotted line).\nshell below for g9\/2 protons [15,58]. Further SM tests of\nthe h\u2212n11\/2 B(E2) have revealed that the underestimation of\nthe 125,126Sn values can be cured by reducing the pairing\ntwo-body matrix elements (TBME) involving h11\/2, while the\nB(E2) for the other configurations are virtually unchanged.\nThe 124Sn 10+ \u2192 8+ transition is not affected, which supports\nthe conclusion that deviations in the decreasing B(E2) toward\nmid-shell for all transitions shown in Fig. 11 are due to the\nincreasing influence of proton-core excitations.\nIn Fig. 11(b) the E2 transition strengths for the positive-\nparity yrast traps with mixed configuration h\u2212n11\/2(s, d), 23\/2+\nand 19\/2+, are compared to the 7\u2212 \u2192 5\u2212 strengths and SM\nresults. Because of the changing configurational character of\nthe states involved, a simple geometrical scaling of odd-A\nto even-A values is not meaningful. Therefore, the odd-A\nvalues are scaled to have equal values for the two- and\nthree-hole isotopes, 130,129Sn. For 130Sn the experimentally\nobserved 5\u2212 \u2192 7\u2212 strength is converted to 7\u2212 \u2192 5\u2212. Again\nthe values for A = 129 and 130 indicate a too small effective\ncharge; the trend with decreasing mass number, however, is\nnicely reproduced by the SM. From the smooth trend of\nboth experimental and SM values, the unobserved branch\nfor the 5\u2212 \u2192 7\u2212 transition in 128Sn can be estimated to be\n0.2% [Fig. 11(b)]. The 19\/2+ \u2192 15\/2+E2 strengths below\nA = 129 seem to be systematically underestimated by the shell\nmodel. The situation for these nonstretched states resembles\nthe 2+ systematics [Fig. 11(c)], where the optimum effective\ncharge changes from 0.70e to 1.00e from 130Sn to 124Sn in\nthe present calculations. It seems that the value of 0.85e best\ndescribes the experimental values [21].\nProton-core excitation besides generally increasing effec-\ntive charges will increase seniority mixing in configurations\ncoupled to less than maximum spin due to the proton-neutron\n(pn) interaction. The 19\/2+ and 15\/2+ wave functions\ncomprise of the h\u00b14,611\/2 configuration with two 6+ and 8+ states\nwith v = 2, 4 within 150 keV, which will undergo increased\nmixing by virtue of pn interaction and, depending on the\nrelative sign of the valence and core-excited contribution,\nenable constructive or destructive interference of \u0006v = 2\ncontributions to the E2 matrix element. It should be noted\nthat while the \u0006v = 0 strength disappears in mid-shell, the\n\u0006v = 2 transition strength peaks there (see, e.g., 2+ \u2192 0+\ntransitions [15,21] (Fig. 2) for the gn9\/2 system).\nV. SUMMARY\nIn relativistic fission and fragmentation reactions several\nSn isotopes in the vicinity of 132Sn have been populated and\ntheir decay in the 0.2 to 14 \u00b5s range has been studied. The data\nallowed the observation of three new isomeric states in 125Sn,\n127Sn, and 129Sn. The new states have been suggested to have\nI\u03c0 = (23\/2+) in 125Sn and (27\/2\u2212) in 127Sn and 129Sn, based\non theoretical calculations for the yrast traps in this high-spin\nregion. The level schemes of these nuclei have been extended\nand, additionally, the transition probabilities for all isomeric\nstates have been extracted.\nShell-model calculations in an untruncated N = 50\u201382\nneutron space give an excellent description of the experimental\nlevel schemes and their systematics with increasing distance\nfrom the doubly-magic 132Sn. The evolution of the E2\nstrengths for transitions from the stretched and pure h\u2212n11\/2 I\u03c0 =\n27\/2\u2212, 10+ seniority v = 3, 2 states toward mid-shell and\nfrom the mixed-orbital I\u03c0 = 23\/2+, 7\u2212, and 19\/2+ isomers\nis well described. Deviations in the absolute values for small\nB(E2) and transitions involving nonstretched configurations\nmay be ascribed to the neglect of proton excitations across\nZ = 50, which can only be partly absorbed by the choice of\na constant effective neutron charge of en = 0.70e. A variation\nfrom 0.70e at N = 82 to 1.00e at N \u223c 70 might be more\nappropriate.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank M.
