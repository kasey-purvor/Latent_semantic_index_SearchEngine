No differential effect was identified by sex.\nConclusions: Anti-discriminatory legislation is not an effective way of overcoming the employment\nconsequences of ill health and disability, nor is it a useful public policy tool in terms of reducing inequalities.\nT\nhere is an abundant and well-established literature\ndescribing socioeconomic inequalities in health status.1\u20133\nInequalities in the social and economic consequences of ill\nhealth, however, is a much less prominent and developed area\nof research, but arguably no less important for tackling\ninequality.4 Furthermore, attempts to empirically examine\nhow public policy interventions affect these consequences or\ntheir social distribution are not widespread.4\u20135\nIll health and disability are often associated negatively with\npoverty, social exclusion and, perhaps most importantly in\nterms of the social determinants of health, lower employment\nrates.3\u20136 For example, in the UK, like in many other countries,\npeople with a disability or limiting long-term illness (LLTI)\nhave a disproportionately low employment rate: currently,\naround 50% of people with a disability of working age (18\u201360\/\n65 years) are in employment compared with 80% of those\nwithout a disability.7 Furthermore, these adverse employment\nconsequences are not evenly distributed across socioeconomic\ngroups. A social gradient is evident, with professional classes\nfairing the best.4\nIn the UK, and elsewhere, public policy has been used as a tool\nby which the employment consequences of ill health or disability\ncan be ameliorated8\u2014for example, active labour market policies\nsuch as subsidised employment, training programmes or\nvocational rehabilitation, and more recently, anti-discriminatory\nlegislation.4 8\u201311 The Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) was\nintroduced in the UK in 1995. It made it unlawful to\n\u2018\u2018discriminate against disabled persons in connection with\nemployment, the provision of goods, facilities and services, or\nthe disposal or management of premises\u2019\u2019 (box 1).12 Similar\nlegislation is in place in other countries such as the USA,\nAustralia, Sweden and The Netherlands.11\nIn a previous paper, we found that the aggregate employment\nrates of people with a disability or an LLTI were at their lowest\nafter the implementation of the DDA. In addition, we found\nthat the employment gap between people with and without a\ndisability was most marked in the post-DDA period. In short,\nwe concluded that the DDA had no positive effect on the\nemployment rates of people with a disability. Our results\nreinforced the findings of other empirical work on the limits of\nthe DDA,13\u201315 they reflected the criticisms of the DDA by\nacademics and disability activists,16\u201319 and they corresponded\nwith the broad results of international research on disability\ndiscrimination legislation.20\u201321\nHowever, both UK and international research has so far only\nexamined the aggregate-level employment effects of anti-\ndiscrimination legislation and there has been no exploration\nof any effect on socioeconomic inequalities in the employment\nconsequences of LLTI or disability. Disaggregated research\nwould not only offer a more comprehensive overview of the\neffects of anti-discrimination legislation, but would also enable\njudgements to be made about whether it is a useful policy tool\nfor tackling inequalities. Therefore, in this paper, we expand on\nour previous DDA research by providing the first exploration of\nthe effects of anti-discriminatory legislation on inequalities in\nthe employment consequences of ill health and disability.\nMETHODS\nData extraction\nThe study comprised an analysis of routinely collected,\nrepresentative national data based on the General Household\nSurvey (GHS). The GHS is a multipurpose continuous cross-\nsectional survey and is carried out annually by the Social Survey\nDivision of the Office for National Statistics. The survey collects\nAbbreviations: DDA, Disability Discrimination Act; GHS, General\nHousehold Survey; LLTI, limiting long-term illness; RGSC, Register\nGeneral\u2019s Social Class\n421\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \ninformation by interview on personal, demographic, household,\nhealth and income characteristics from households in the UK.22\nThis analysis utilised survey data over a 14-year period from\n1990 to 2003 (the latest published data), with a sample size\nranging from 19 193 to 24 657 and response rates ranging from\n72% to 82%. The GHS was not conducted in 1997 and 1999 and\ntherefore the routine data analysis pertains to 12 surveys.\nTo define disability for the study, questions asked about LLTI\nin the GHS were used (box 2) as an alternative to the DDA\ndefinition of disability, which was not available for the whole\nperiod of analysis (box 1). The utilisation of the GHS definition\nallowed a continuous definition of disability to be used before\nand after implementation of the DDA. The GHS definition was\ntherefore not directly affected by changes to the definition of\ndisability that the DDA may have created (for example, from\n1997 the Labour Force Survey definition of disability was\nchanged to reflect that of the DDA). We previously demon-\nstrated that the GHS definition of disability was comparable to\nthe DDA definition; similar age-standardised rates of disability\nand employment rates in the disabled were observed for the\nGHS and the Labour Force Survey (after 1997).11\nData extraction included information from the GHS pertain-\ning to disability, employment status and various demographic\ndetails including age, sex and social class (box 2). Disability\nwas defined as \u2018\u2018any long-standing illness or disability that has\nlimited activity\u2019\u2019 (\u2018\u2018disabled\u2019\u2019). This group was compared with\nthose without an LLTI or a disability (defined as \u2018\u2018not\ndisabled\u2019\u2019). The proportion of people defined as disabled was\nsimilar over the 14 years of data collection using the GHS (rates\nof disability ranged from 17.5% to 20.5% from 1990 to 2003).\nEmployment status was defined as \u2018\u2018working\u2019\u2019 (currently in\npaid employment) or \u2018\u2018not working\u2019\u2019 (not currently in paid\nemployment). For this analysis only individuals of working age\n(18\u201360 years in women and 18\u201365 years in men) were selected.\nBefore 2001, the GHS measured social class on the basis of\noccupation (formerly Register General\u2019s Social Class (RGSC))\nand grouped individuals with similar levels of occupational skill\nusing an ordinal scale with six categories (I, II, IIIN (non-\nmanual), IIIM (manual), IV and V). After 2001, the GHS\nadopted new socioeconomic groupings, as recommended by the\nEconomic and Social Research Council, classifying people with\nsimilar social and economic status. This new socioeconomic\nclassification was derived from occupational unit group,\nemployment status and size of establishment, and included\neight groupings: 1 (higher managerial and professional\noccupations), 2 (lower managerial and professional occupa-\ntions), 3 (intermediate occupations), 4 (small employers and\nown account workers), 5 (lower supervisory and technical\noccupations), 6 (semiroutine occupations), 7 (routine occupa-\ntions) and 8 (never worked and long-term unemployed). Using\nthe new classification, it is possible to produce an approximated\nversion of the previous socioeconomic classification (RGSC)\nand these approximations have been shown to achieve an\noverall continuity level of 87%.23 For the purpose of this\nanalysis, social class has been measured using the RGSC\nclassification for the 12 surveys of the GHS.\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003\nYear of survey\nEm\npl\noy\nm\nen\nt r\nat\ne \n(%\n)\nclass I \/ II\nclass IIIN\nclass IIIM\nclass IV\/ V\nFigure 1 Age-standardised employment\nrates from 1990 to 2003 in people defined\nas not disabled by social class (four\ngroupings).\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003\nYear of survey\nEm\npl\noy\nm\nen\nt r\nat\ne \n(%\n)\nclass I \/ II\nclass IIIN\nclass IIIM\nclass IV \/ V\nFigure 2 Age-standardised employment\nrates from 1990 to 2003 in people defined\nas disabled by social class (four groupings).\n422 Bambra, Pope\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nData analysis\nGHS data were available for 12 surveys (1990\u20131996, 1998 and\n2000\u20132003). Employment rates for each survey were calculated\nfor \u2018\u2018disabled\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018not disabled\u2019\u2019 and standardised for age\nusing the European Standard Population, adjusting for\ndifferences in age structure over the data collection period.\nDifferences in employment rates between disabled and not\ndisabled groups for each of the 12 surveys were also calculated.\nThe analysis was then stratified by sex and social class; given\nthe relatively small numbers of unemployed individuals with a\ndisability in social class I and V, social class was grouped\naccordingly to maximise the efficiency of the analysis: 1, I\/II; 2,\nIIIN; 3, IIIM; and 4, IV\/V.\nAnalysis of covariance was used to estimate the effect of the\nDDA on employment rates for people defined as disabled. The\nanalysis was carried out in SPSS by using the univariate general\nlinear model function. Models included employment rate as the\ndependent variable and disability (1, \u2018\u2018disabled\u2019\u2019 and 0, \u2018\u2018not\ndisabled\u2019\u2019), DDA (1, \u2018\u2018post-DDA\u2019\u2019; years 1998\u20132003 and 0, \u2018\u2018pre-\nDDA\u2019\u2019; years 1990\u20131996) and year of survey as covariates. To\nestimate the effect that the DDA might have had on employ-\nment rates in people defined as disabled, an interaction term\nwas added to each general linear model representing\n\u2018\u2018disability6DDA\u2019\u2019. All analyses were stratified by (1) sex and\n(2) social class. SPSS V.13 statistical software was used to carry\nout the analyses.\nRESULTS\nWe reported elsewhere that, since the implementation of the\nDDA, the disparity in employment rates between disabled and\nnot-disabled people has actually seemed to increase.11 In this\nanalysis, we found no evidence that this disparity differed by\nsex; disabled men and women were equally likely to have a\nconsistently lower employment rate since the implementation\nof the DDA than not disabled men and women. However, a\ndifferential pattern was observed by socioeconomic class.\nAge-standardised employment rates for not disabled and\ndisabled people over the 14-year period are shown by socio-\neconomic class group in figs 1 and 2. Employment rates for the\nnot disabled group seem to have slightly increased for all\nsocioeconomic classes over the 14-year period (fig 1). Although\nthe gap between employment rates for socioeconomic classes I\nand II and IV and V seemed to remain constant over the period\nof analysis, employment rates for socioeconomic class IIIM\nhave risen to match those of socioeconomic classes I and II after\n2000.\nThe disparity between employment rates for people in the\nhighest socioeconomic class groups (I and II) compared with\nthe lowest socioeconomic classes (IV and V) was considerably\nTable 1 Analyses of covariance showing effect of (1) the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA); (2) being defined as \u2018\u2018disabled\u2019\u2019; and\n(3) the interaction between disability and the DDA on employment rate (overall and by social class)\nVariable Regression coefficient t value* Significance 95% CI\nModel 1: For all employment rates adjusted for social class and year\nDDA (1998\u20132003) 5.51 2.08 0.041 0.23 to 10.79\nDisability 221.13 215.28 ,0.001 223.87 to 218.38\nDisability 6DDA\u0001 26.78 23.17 0.002 211.04 to 22.53\nModel 2: For employment rates social classes I and II adjusted for year\nDDA (1998\u20132003) 6.07 1.75 0.096 21.18 to 13.31\nDisability 214.85 28.28 ,0.001 218.63 to 211.08\nDisability6DDA\u0001 22.86 21.02 0.319 28.70 to 2.99\nModel 3: For employment rates social class IIIN adjusted for year\nDDA (1998\u20132003) 2.95 0.995 0.332 23.26 to 9.16\nDisability 218.22 211.79 ,0.001 221.45 to 214.98\nDisability6DDA\u0001 25.22 22.18 0.042 210.23 to 20.21\nModel 4: For employment rates social class IIIM adjusted for year\nDDA (1998\u20132003) 6.10 3.31 1.85 20.82 to 13.02\nDisability 225.19 214.64 ,0.001 228.79 to 221.59\nDisability6DDA\u0001 28.36 23.13 0.005 213.94 to 22.78\nModel 5: For employment rates social classes IV and V adjusted for year\nDDA (1998\u20132003) 6.92 2.58 0.019 1.30 to 12.55\nDisability 226.25 218.75 ,0.001 229.18 to 223.32\nDisability6DDA\u0001 210.7 24.94 ,0.001 215.24 to 26.16\n*All parameters have 1 degree of freedom.\n\u0001Interaction term combining disability status with implementation of the DDA.\nFigure 3 Percentage change in age-standardised employment rate in\nindividuals defined as disabled after implementation of the Disability\nDiscrimination Act (DDA).

This has led to a\ngreater gap in employment rates between those in the lowest\nsocioeconomic group than those in all other socioeconomic\ngroups since the DDA.\nTable 1 shows the results from the analyses of covariance\nestimating the effect of the DDA on employment rates in the\ndisabled by socioeconomic class. The first model estimated the\noverall affect of the DDA on employment rates in the disabled,\nadjusting for year of the GHS and socioeconomic class group.\nPeople defined as disabled had a significantly lower employ-\nment rate, approximately 21% (95% CI 18.4% to 23.9%) lower,\non average, than those defined as not disabled over the 14-year\nanalysis period. A significantly negative interaction was\nidentified between disability status and the DDA in relation\nto standardised employment rate. The mean employment rate\ndecreased, on average, by a further 7% (95% CI 2.5% to 11%)\nafter the DDA.\nFour additional models were created (table 1) after stratify-\ning the analysis by the socioeconomic class groupings (I and II,\nIIIN, IIIM and IV and V). Although, as would be expected,\ndisabled people had a significantly lower average employment\nrate than not disabled people for all socioeconomic class groups,\nthe difference in employment rates increased in a linear fashion\nwith decreasing socioeconomic class. For socioeconomic classes\nI and II, employment rates for disabled people were, on average,\n14.9% (95% CI 11.1% to 18.6%) lower than for not-disabled\npeople, increasing to 26.3% (95% CI 23.3% to 29.2%) lower\nemployment rates in socioeconomic classes IV and V. The\nextent to which the DDA influenced the disparity between\nemployment rates of disabled and not disabled individuals was\nstrongly related to the socioeconomic class (table 1, fig 3). The\ninteraction term including disability and DDA was not\nsignificantly associated with employment rate for socio-\neconomic classes I and II. However, a significant interaction\nwas identified in socioeconomic class IIIN such that employ-\nment rates in the disabled decreased by 5.2% (95% CI 0.2% to\n10.2%) after the DDA. The observed reduction in employment\nrates for disabled people associated with the DDA was even\ngreater for socioeconomic class IIIM (an average reduction of\n8.4%; 95% CI 2.8% to 13.9%) and was greatest for socio-\neconomic classes IV and V (an average reduction of 10.7%; 95%\nCI 6.2% to 15.2%).\nDISCUSSION\nThe results in this paper reinforce that in the UK there are large\nsocioeconomic inequalities in the employment consequences of\nill health and disability.4 People with a disability or an LLTI in\nsocioeconomic classes I and II have consistently higher\nemployment rates than those in other socioeconomic classes.\nFurthermore, the difference between the employment rates of\npeople with a disability or an LLTI in classes I and II, and those\nof their not disabled peers is smaller than that between disabled\nand non-disabled people in other socioeconomic classes. In\naddition, our research suggests that public policy, in the form of\nthe DDA, was unable to reduce these inequalities. Indeed, the\ndata suggest that the gap between the employment rates of\npeople with a disability or an LLTI in classes I and II and those\nin classes III, IV and V increased in the period after the\nimplementation of the legislation.\nThe difference in the employment rates of socioeconomic\nclasses may be a byproduct of the types of work (manual vs\nnon-manual employment) carried out. However, although this\nmight explain the overall inequality between classes, it does not\naddress the increased inequity after the introduction of the\nDDA. We cautiously suggest the following explanations for the\nobserved change.\nFirstly, research has suggested that many employers are\nfearful of the possible enhanced recruitment and retention\ncosts incurred as a result of the legislation.24 Even standardised\ncosts may well be a disproportionately higher amount of the\nwage bill for lower socioeconomic occupations than for classes I\nand II. Furthermore, the skills of employees in socioeconomic\nclasses I and II may be seen to outweigh the costs incurred.\nSecondly, the emphasis in the legislation is very much on the\nindividual person with a disability or an LLTI to assert their\nDDA employment rights in order to gain or retain employment.\nThey are required to show that they are (1) disabled under the\nterms of the Act and (2) that they were discriminated against\non this basis.16\u201318 It is highly possible that people in classes I and\nII are more aware and articulate about such rights. Similarly,\nemployers of professional groups may be more aware of the\nDDA and its ramifications for their employment practice.\nBox 1 Disability Discrimination Act (1995)\nN The 1995 UK Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) made\ndiscrimination on the grounds of physical or mental\ndisability or limiting long-term illness illegal: since the\nimplementation of the DDA from 1996 onwards it has\nbeen unlawful to \u2018\u2018discriminate against disabled persons\nin connection with employment, the provision of goods,\nfacilities and services, or the disposal or management of\npremises\u2019\u2019.12\nN Employers are required to make \u2018\u2018reasonable adjust-\nments\u2019\u2019 to work and premises to cater for people with a\ndisability.\nN Originally, the employment provisions of the DDA only\napplied to companies with .15 employees. However,\nsince the 2003 amendments, it applies to all employers.\nN More recent amendments such as the 2001 Special\nEducational Needs and Disability Act have extended the\nremit of disability anti-discrimination legislation to other\nareas with employment opportunity implications such as\naccess to education and training.26\nN Under the DDA, disability is defined as: \u2018\u2018a physical or\nmental impairment that has a substantial and long-term\nadverse effect on his\/her ability to carry out normal day-\nto-day activities\u2019\u2019.12 27\nN Physical impairment\u2014this includes weakening or adverse\nchange of a part of the body caused through illness, by\naccident or from birth, such as blindness, deafness, heart\ndisease, the paralysis of a limb or severe disfigurement.\nN Mental impairment\u2014this can include learning disabilities\nand all recognised mental illnesses.\nN Substantial\u2014this does not have to be severe, but is more\nthan minor or trivial.\nN Long-term adverse effect\u2014that has lasted or is likely to\nlast .12 months.\nN A normal day-to-day activity\u2014that is, one that affects\none of the following: mobility; manual dexterity; physical\ncoordination; continence; ability to lift, carry or otherwise\nmove everyday objects; speech, hearing or eyesight;\nmemory or ability to concentrate, learn or understand; or\nperception of the risk of physical danger.\n424 Bambra, Pope\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nFinally, evidence suggests that awareness of the DDA is low\namong UK employers15 24: in a recent study carried out on\nbehalf of the Department of Work and Pensions, only 63% of\nemployers were aware of the DDA, 33% considered that\nemploying a person with a disability or an LLTI was a major\nrisk and 47% did not think that they would retain a worker who\ndeveloped a disability or an LLTI.24\nRegardless of the reasons, the findings of this study will add\nfurther weight to existing criticisms levied against the DDA by\nboth academics and disability activists.16\u201319\nLimitations\nOne limitation of this analysis is the reliance on self-reported\nhealth and employment status. Self-reports can be subject to\nsome inaccuracy.25 Another issue is disability, which can be\ndefined in different ways.6 8 We used the GHS definition\nrelating to a long-term illness or disability (box 2), which\nunfortunately does not fully incorporate the more specific DDA\ndefinition (box 1). However, we previously demonstrated that\nthe GHS definition of disability was comparable to the DDA\ndefinition.11 Furthermore, it has only been possible to examine\nthe short-term effects of the DDA (from 1998 to 2003) on\nemployment rates. It is possible that over the longer term, the\ntrend identified might change. Perhaps the most important\nlimitation though is that the study utilises a cross-sectional\nsurvey, which means that it has not been possible to track the\neffect of the DDA on individuals.\nCONCLUSION\nThis paper has examined differences in the employment\nconsequences of disability or LLTI before and after the\nimplementation of the DDA. We have shown that pre-existing\nsocioeconomic class inequalities in the employment rates of\npeople with an LLTI or a disability increased after the DDA.\nPeople with a disability or LLTI in socioeconomic classes I and II\nwere more likely to be employed than their counterparts in\nclasses III, IV and V both before and after the DDA. The anti-\ndiscrimination legislation was therefore not effective in the\nshort term in closing the gap, and in fact it would seem that it\nhas exacerbated pre-existing inequalities in the social and\neconomic consequences of ill health and disability. Our\nresearch suggests therefore that anti-discriminatory legislation,\nat least in the UK context, may not be the most effective way of\novercoming the social consequences of ill health and disability,\nnor a particularly useful policy tool in terms of reducing\nBox 2 Questions relating to employment, disability\nand long-term illness in the UK General Household\nSurvey (1990\u20132003)\nWorking\nN Did you do any paid work in the 7 days ending Sunday\nthe (n), either as an employee or as self-employed?\n\u2013 Yes\u20141\n\u2013 No\u20142\nI l lness [*]\nN Do you have any long-standing illness, disability or\ninfirmity?
