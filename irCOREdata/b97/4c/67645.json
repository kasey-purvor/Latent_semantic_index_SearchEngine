Parks7\nReceived 28 September 2001; revised 20 November 2001; accepted 21 November 2001; published 1 August 2002.\n[1] This paper presents a case study of ionospheric response to an interplanetary\nmagnetic field (IMF) southward turning. It is based on a comprehensive set of\nobservations, including a global network of ground magnetometers, global auroral\nimages, and a SuperDARN HF radar. There is a clear evidence for a two-stage\nionospheric response to the IMF southward turning, namely, fast initial onset and slow\nfinal reconfiguration. The fast onset is manifested by nearly simultaneous (within 2 min)\nrise of ground magnetic perturbations at all local times, corroborated by a sudden change\nin the direction of line-of-sight velocity near local midnight and by the simultaneous\nequatorward shift of the auroral oval. The slow reconfiguration is characterized by the\ndifferent rising rate of magnetic perturbations with latitudes: faster at high latitude than at\nlower latitudes. Furthermore, a cross-correlation analysis of the magnetometer data shows\nthat the maximum magnetic perturbation is reached first near local noon, and then spread\ntoward the nightside, corresponding to a dayside-to-nightside propagation speed of\n\u00015 km\/s along the auroral oval. Global ionospheric convection patterns are derived based\non ground magnetometer data along with auroral conductances inferred from the Polar\nUV images, using the assimilative mapping of ionospheric electrodynamics (AMIE)\nprocedure. The AMIE patterns, especially the residual convection patterns, clearly show a\nglobally coherent development of two-cell convection configuration following the IMF\nsouthward turning. While the foci of the convection patterns remain nearly steady, the\nconvection flow does intensify with time and the cross-polar-cap potential drop increases.\nThe overall changes as shown in the AMIE convection patterns therefore are fully\nconsistent with the two-stage ionospheric response to the IMF southward\nturning.

Introduction\n[2] The interaction between the solar wind and the\nEarth\u2019s magnetosphere produces a system of plasma circu-\nlation or convection in the magnetosphere and high latitude\nionosphere. The ionospheric convection configuration\ntherefore provides important information of the solar\nwind-magnetosphere coupling. Although the behavior of\nionospheric convection under steady interplanetary mag-\nnetic field (IMF) conditions is generally well understood,\nhow the ionosphere responds to the changing IMF is an\nissue still under debate [Ridley et al.,1999; Lockwood and\nCowley, 1999]. The main dispute is whether the ionospheric\nconvection responds nearly simultaneously over the entire\npolar region or if the enhanced convection flows are first\nestablished in the vicinity of the dayside cusp and then\npropagate antisunward toward the nightside ionosphere in\n\u000115\u201325 min.\n[3] The antisunward propagation concept was first pro-\nposed by Lockwood et al. [1986] based on the F region ion\ntemperature changes observed by the EISCAT incoherent\nradar following a southward turning of the IMF. By exam-\nining the time delay between the temperature changes\nobserved by two separate azimuthal scan beams in the\nafternoon sector, they estimated an eastward propagation\nspeed of 2.6 km\/s. The antisunward propagation has since\nbeen reported in several studies. Through statistical survey\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 107, NO.

[1988] and Todd et al. [1988] found that the response\ntime of ionospheric convection to the IMF changes\nincreases with distance away from local noon, correspond-\ning to a dayside-to-nightside propagation speed of 5\u201310\nkm\/s along the auroral oval. A similar time delay in iono-\nspheric response was reported by Saunders et al. [1992],\nwho examined ground magnetic perturbations over Canada\nin response to the north-south IMF oscillations and con-\ncluded that the response in ionospheric plasma flow spreads\noutward from noon toward dawn and dusk at a phase speed\nof \u00015 km\/s. This point of view was reiterated by Khan and\nCowley [1999] using a large data set of EISCAT tristatic\nflow measurements. They found the epicenter of informa-\ntion propagation to be located at 1400 MLT and the\npropagation phase speed to be 6.8 km\/s. A common feature\nof these studies is that they all were based on localized\nobservations and had employed the cross-correlation anal-\nysis scheme.\n[4] The antisunward propagation concept, however, has\nbeen seriously challenged recently by Ridley et al. [1997,\n1998] and by Ruohoniemi and Greenwald [1998]. By\nexamining the global convection patterns derived from the\nassimilative mapping of ionospheric electrodynamics\n(AMIE) procedure [Richmond and Kamide, 1988], Ridley\net al. showed that the response of ionospheric convection\nflow is nearly simultaneous (within 1 min) in the entire\npolar region and there is no apparent propagation from\ndayside to nightside in the evolving convection patterns\n[Ridley et al., 1997, 1998]. Observations from the HF radars\nof the SuperDARN network during a southward IMF turn-\ning event also presented a strong evidence of rapid response\nof line-of-sight ion drift at local time sectors extending from\nnoon to premidnight in less than 2 min [Ruohoniemi and\nGreenwald, 1998].\n[5] In this paper we present a case study using a com-\nprehensive set of data, including a global network of ground\nmagnetometer data, global auroral images, a HF radar,\nalong with the aid of the AMIE procedure. We show that\nthe different timescales regarding the ionosphere responding\nto IMF changes are associated with the two different aspects\nof the overall response, that is, the initial onset of enhanced\nflow and the final reconfiguration of ionospheric convec-\ntion. The former is rather rapid, taking place over the entire\npolar ionosphere within a couple of minutes. The latter, on\nthe other hand, is gradual, with the reconfiguration estab-\nlished first on the dayside and then on the nightside \u000125\nmin later. Such a two-stage response has been recognized by\nsome recent studies [e.g., Jayachandran and MacDougall,\n2000; Murr and Hughes, 2001; Nishitani et al., 2002]. We\ndiscuss the physical implications of the two-stage response.\n2. Observations\n[6] The three components of the IMF measured by the\nWind (solid) and Geotail (dashed) satellites, respectively,\nfrom 0130 to 0430 UT on 10 January 1997, are shown in\nFigure 1. Wind was located upstream of the Earth at (86,\n\u000259, \u00024) RE, and Geotail was in the magnetosheath at (9,\n\u00024, 1) RE in GSE (X, Y, Z ) coordinates. The close\ncorrelation between Geotail and Wind measurements\nyielded a time delay of 13 min for the solar wind to\npropagate from the Wind location to the front of the\nmagnetopause. Notice that a time delay of 18 min for Wind\nwould have been estimated if based on its X distance and the\nsolar wind speed of 440 km\/s [Brittnacher et al., 1999]. The\nbottom panel of Figure 1 shows the 1-min resolution of AU\nand AL indices derived from the north\u2013south component of\nthe magnetic perturbations recorded at 69 stations located\nbetween |55\u0001| and |76\u0001| magnetic latitude (MLAT). The\nvertical dotted line marks the arrival of the IMF southward\nturning at the magnetopause at 0218 UT. Though there was\na positive change in the IMF Bx component measured by\nWind, no such change was seen by Geotail. Thus caution\nshould be used when correlating the solar wind variations\nwith the magnetospheric-ionospheric response, as the solar\nwind conditions measured upstream may not always be the\nsame as those near the Earth. No sign change in By was\nobserved by either satellite in the vicinity of 0218 UT. Prior\nto that, Bz was mainly northward except for a temporal\nsouthward excursion around 0135 UT. There were some\nfluctuations in By between 0130 and 0200 UT, which\nprobably were responsible for the variations seen in the\nAL index. After the IMF turned southward AL gradually\ndecreased from \u000220 nT to nearly \u0002200 nT due to the\nenhancement of the westward electrojet on the dawnside. A\nsubstorm was developed later at 0334 UT when the first\nauroral brightening was observed near local midnight by the\nPolar satellite [Brittnacher et al., 1999].\n[7] Figure 2 shows a series of consecutive convection\npatterns in the Northern Hemisphere between 0212 and\n0257 UT in 3-min increments. The patterns were derived\nfrom AMIE based on the 1-min averaged data from a global\nFigure 1. Variations of the interplanetary magnetic field\n(IMF) and the AU and AL indices from 0130 to 0430 UT on\n10 January 1997. The Wind data are shown by the solid\nlines using the left-hand side scales, and the Geotail data are\nshown by the dashed lines using the right-hand side scales.\nSIA 2 - 2 LU ET AL.: FAST ONSET AND SLOW RECONFIGURATION\nnetwork of ground magnetometers (in this case there were\n123 magnetometer stations worldwide, among them 87\nstations were located above 50\u0001 MLAT in the Northern\nHemisphere), along with auroral ionospheric conductances\nderived from global auroral UV images [Lummerzheim et\nal., 1997]. In this study no data from polar-orbiting satellites\n(which take 20 \u0001 25 min to pass the polar region and \u0001100\nmin to orbit the Earth) and the SuperDARN radars (which\ntypically have a 2-min temporal resolution) were used as\ninputs to the AMIE fitting to avoid possible intermittent\ndata coverage along the satellite track or in the radar\u2019s field\nof view. In order to eliminate the influence of the input\nstatistical potential model on the AMIE convection patterns,\nparticularly in regions where data coverage is poor, we have\nset the background potential to zero everywhere (see Lu et\nal. [2001] for more information.) From 0212 to 0224 UT the\nplasma convection was not well organized, consisting of\nmainly weak, clockwise plasma flows on the nightside half\nof the hemisphere. From 0227 UT and onward the con-\nvection configuration quickly evolved into a well organized\ntwo-cell pattern with antisunward convection across the\npolar cap.\n[8] In order to see more clearly how the convection\npatterns evolve in association with the IMF southward\nturning, we show in Figure 3 the corresponding residual\nconvection patterns. The residual patterns are obtained by\nsubtracting a base pattern, which is the average from 0212\nFigure 2. Consecutive convection patterns from 0212 to 0258 UT. The dashed contours represent\nnegative potentials, and the solid contours represent positive potentials. The contour interval is 5 kV. The\nfield of view of the beam 1 and beam 4 of the Stokkserey radar at 0225 UT is plotted over the 0224 UT\nconvection pattern.\nFigure 3. Residual convection patterns from 0218 to 0255\nUT. The residual patterns are obtained by subtracting a\nsteady base pattern from the corresponding patterns shown\nin Figure 2, where the base pattern is the average of the\npatterns between 0212 and 0224 UT.\nLU ET AL.: FAST ONSET AND SLOW RECONFIGURATION SIA 2 - 3\nand 0224 UT, from the overall patterns shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 3 demonstrates the development of the two-cell\nconvection configuration after 0227 UT that is fully con-\nsistent with the southward IMF orientation. The potential\ndrop of the residual convection patterns increased from 20\nkV at 0227 UT to 63 kV at 0246 UT and then decreased\nsomewhat to 52 kV at 0255 UT. While the convection flow\nacross the polar cap intensified, the foci of the two dominant\nconvection cells remained nearly steady throughout the\ninterval. There was no evidence that would otherwise show\nthe convection cells had propagated from dayside to night-\nside.\n[9] The SuperDARN HF radars were in operation during\nthe event. Unfortunately, most of the radars did not receive\ngood backscatters, except for the Iceland West radar in\nStokkeseyri located near local midnight. Figure 4 shows the\nStokkseyri measurements of backscattered power, the line-\nof-sight velocity, and the spectral width from two separate\nbeams (e.g., Beam 1 and Beam 4 whose fields of view are\nshown in Figure 2). Both beams observed a transition from\nnegative velocity (away from the radar) to positive velocity\n(toward the radar) at \u00010225 UT, which, as shown below, is\nconsistent with the onset of magnetic perturbations at most\nground magnetometer stations.\n[10] The response of ground magnetic perturbations is\nillustrated in Figure 5 where the magnitude of horizontal\nmagnetic perturbations at different local time sectors is\nplotted. The Canadian Auroral Network for the OPEN\nProgram Unified Study (CANOPUS) magnetometer chain\nlocated near dusk (Figure 5a) shows an almost simultaneous\nrise of magnetic perturbations at \u00010225 UT at all latitudes,\nexcept for the 2 middle stations at Rankin Inlet (RAN) and\nFort Churchill (FCC) where a small bump makes the\nidentification of the beginning of the rise somewhat difficult\nand the rise at these two stations may be considered at 0225\nUT \u00b1 2 min. It is also evident that the rising rate varies with\nlatitude: faster at high latitude than at lower latitudes. The\nGreenland magnetometer chain located near local midnight\nFigure 4.

Measurements from Beam 1 are shown on the left and Beam\n4 on the right. Ground scatters are indicated by the grey color.\nFigure 5. Stack plots of the 1-min horizontal magnetic\nperturbations at selected magnetometer stations: (a) CA-\nNOPUS chain, (b) Greenland chain, (c) IMAGE chain, and\n(d) selected stations at different MLTs between 64\u0001 and 70\u0001\nmagnetic latitudes. The MLT given for each station\ncorresponds to 0230 UT. The scale is 60 nT between\ndividing lines for all stations except those shown as heavy\nsolid lines (e.g., NAQ, HOP, BJN, and JAN) for which the\nscale is twice as indicated.\nSIA 2 - 4 LU ET AL.: FAST ONSET AND SLOW RECONFIGURATION\n(Figure 5b) also recorded a nearly simultaneous rise of the\nhorizontal magnetic perturbations at all stations, so did the\nInternational Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects\n(IMAGE) chain near dawn (Figure 5c). Figure 5d shows\nthe horizontal magnetic perturbations at eight selected\nstations located between 65\u0001 and 70\u0001 MLAT but at different\nMLTs. Inspection of Figure 5d shows that the six stations\nspanning from dusk to dawn all recorded a similar onset\ntime in the magnetic perturbation at \u00010225 UT. The two\nstations near local noon saw only very small increase in\nmagnitude. By all accounts, the magnetometer data shown\nin Figure 5 seem to support the notion that there is a global,\nnearly simultaneous (within 2 min) initial response to the\nIMF southward turning. This is fully in agreement with\nprevious observations of Ridley et al. [1997, 1998], Ruo-\nhoniemi and Greenwald [1998], Lu et al. [2001], Murr and\nHughes [2001], and Nishitani et al. [2002].\n[11] Cross-correlation analysis has been applied to radar\nand ground magnetometer data in the past [e.g., Lockwood\net al., 1986; Todd et al., 1988; Etemadi et al., 1988;\nSaunders et al., 1992; Khan and Cowley, 1999]. It has\nhelped reach the conclusion that there is a time delay in\nionospheric response from dayside to nightside.\n[12] We also applied the cross-correlation analysis to the\nmagnetometer data. We chose the CANOPUS station Res-\nolute Bay (RBC) located in the polar cap as a reference\nsince it observed the clearest initial onset as well as the peak\nresponse. For each magnetometer station, a 40-min segment\nof data from 0225 to 0305 UTwas used to correlate with the\nRBC data with a time lag of 20 min before and after the\ngiven interval. A detailed cross correlation is plotted in\nFigure 6. The triangles shown in Figure 5 indicate the time\nlags corresponding to the maximum cross-correlation coef-\nficient at each station with respect to RBC. Here the\nreference time was set at when RBC reached its peak\nmagnetic perturbation, and a positive time lag means\nRBC leading the corresponding station. The distribution\nof the triangles indicates that the cross-correlation analysis\ntends to relate the peak magnetic perturbation, rather than\ntheir initial onset, among the different stations. The heavy\ndashed curves in Figure 5 are the second-order polynomial\nfitting to the triangles for each magnetometer chain. For\nFigure 6. Distributions of the cross-correlation coefficient\nfor the corresponding magnetometers shown in Figure 6\nwith respect to Resolute Bay (RBC). A positive time lag\nindicates RBC leading the corresponding magnetometer\nstation.\nFigure 7. Keograms at different MLT sectors derived from\nthe Polar UVI images.\nLU ET AL.: FAST ONSET AND SLOW RECONFIGURATION SIA 2 - 5\nboth CANOPUS and Greenland meridional chains, there\nwas a trend that the arrival of the peak magnetic perturba-\ntions were faster at high latitudes than at lower latitudes, but\nthe peak perturbation at the IMAGE chain was reached\nnearly simultaneously at all latitudes. The longitudinal\nchain, however, shows a more pronounced time delay in\nthe arrival of the peak magnetic perturbation. As shown in\nFigure 5d, there is a time delay of \u000125 min from local noon\nto local midnight. Considering a half circle along 67.5\u0001\nMLAT (the average latitude of the longitudinal chain), this\ntime delay would imply a dayside-to-nightside propagation\nspeed of \u00015 km\/s, comparable to what has been reported\npreviously [e.g., Lockwood et al., 1986; Todd et al., 1988;\nSaunders et al., 1992; Khan and Cowley, 1999]. It should be\nremembered that all these studies have invoked the cross-\ncorrelation analysis scheme. One thing to notice is that the\nlongest time delay was not at midnight but rather near the\ndusk. This may be due to the fact that the IMF By remained\npositive so that the overall convection configuration was\nasymmetric about the noon-midnight meridian. As illus-\ntrated in Figure 2, the direction of the polar cap convection\nflow was roughly along the 0900\u20132100 MLT meridian.\n[13] Global auroral images were available during the\ninterval of interest, allowing us to examine the motion of\nthe entire auroral oval in response to the IMF southward\nturning. Figure 7 shows the keogram obtained from the Polar\nUVI at different MLT sectors to illustrate the changes of the\nauroral boundary. An auroral gap was present in the prenoon\nsector after \u00010230 UT. The structures poleward of the main\nauroral oval were the remnants of a Sun-aligned arc initially\nformed during the previous northward IMF condition [Britt-\nnacher et al., 1999]. From postnoon to evening and into the\nmorning sector the auroral oval, particularly the equatorward\nauroral oval boundary, moved systematically equatorward\nafter \u00010225 UT (marked by the vertical dashed lines). The\nequatorward shift of the central auroral oval, however, was\nnot uniform, varying from a small shift (<3\u0001) in the post\nnoon sector as well as near dawn to a significant shift (>5\u0001)\nat dusk, premidnight, and post midnight sectors. The auroral\noval ceased its equatorward motion at \u00010250 UT along\n1330\u20131430 MLT, and at 0300 UT along 1530\u20131630 MLT,\nbut it continued to move equatorward in the midnight sector.\nOne important feature to note is that, while the rate of\nequatorward motion varied with MLT, the onset of such a\nshift was nearly simultaneous around 0225 UT at local times\nextending from postnoon to early morning, and there was no\napparent time delay from dayside to nightside.\n[14] While the Polar UV images showed the global\ndistribution of the auroral oval, the DMSP F12 satellite that\npassed over the northern ionosphere from postdusk to\nprenoon provided useful additional information of the\ncharacteristics of precipitating particles. As shown in\nFigure 8, from 0239 to 0241 UT, the DMSP satellite crossed\nthe auroral oval between 69.2 and 76.3 MLAT near 1930\nMLT where the precipitating particles were identified as\noriginating from the central plasma sheet (CPS) and boun-\ndary plasma sheet (BPS). The auroral oval thus identified is\nhighlighted by the heavy bar in Figure 7d, which coincides\nreasonably well with the main auroral oval in the Polar UV\nimages. Poleward of the oval was a region characterized by\nboth low-energy (<1 keV) precipitating electrons and ions\ndenoted as the plasma mantle [Newell et al., 1991]. The\npoleward boundary of the oval therefore represents the\nopen-closed boundary in the postdusk sector. Other features\nrevealed by the DMSP spectrogram include the polar rain\n(PR) precipitation, the polar arcs over the dayside polar cap,\nand the cusp and mantle regions near local noon.\n3. Discussion\n[15] The response of ionospheric electrodynamic fields\nto IMF changes has very important implications for the\nFigure 8. DMSP F12 spectrograms of differential energy flux from 0238 to 0250 UT. The different\nplasma regimes are identified on the bottom.\nSIA 2 - 6 LU ET AL.: FAST ONSET AND SLOW RECONFIGURATION\nsolar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling processes.\nCurrently, there are two diametrically opposed views\nregarding how ionospheric convection flows are established\nfollowing an IMF orientation change: simultaneous versus\nprogressive.\n[16] Studies that advocate the simultaneous ionospheric\nresponse have been based on observations taken simulta-\nneously at various local times, such as a worldwide network\nof ground magnetometers [Ridley et al., 1997, 1998; Murr\nand Hughes, 2001; Nishitani et al., 2001] or the Super-\nDARN radar network [Ruohoniemi and Greenwald, 1998;\nShepherd et al., 1999]. This paper yet provides additional\nevidence in support of such a rapid response. Rapid iono-\nspheric response to the IMF variations implies that the\ncoupling process is closely controlled by the ionosphere,\nfor example, via a fast magnetosonic wave [Ridley et al.,\n1998]. Another possible explanation for a rapid ionospheric\nresponse to the IMF changes has been suggested by\nShepherd et al. [1999] as due to the draping of the field\nlines of the new IMF state over a large portion of the\ndayside magnetopause. Though it is a plausible mechanism\nof the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction, it does not\nprovide a full explanation for the rapid dayside-to-nightside\nresponse seen by the SuperDARN radar. The field line\ndraping itself is a relatively slow process controlled by the\nmagnetosheath flow velocity. In the study of Shepherd et al.\n[1999], Geotail was located near the subsolar magnetopause\nand IMP 8 located near the dawn flank of the magneto-\nsheath. The IMF southward turning was observed by Geo-\ntail at 1652 UT, and by IMP 8 at 1713 UT. However, in the\nmeantime, the global ionospheric convection changed\nnearly simultaneously (within 2 min) over the entire polar\nregion at \u00011703 UT. If the draping indeed was solely\nresponsible for the ionospheric convection changes, one\nwould expect the ionospheric change to propagate away\nfrom the dayside cusp no faster than the corresponding\ndraping process taking place in the magnetosheath.\nRecently, global MHD simulations have shown that the\nhigh-latitude ionospheric convection starts to change across\nthe entire polar cap just a few minutes after the arrival of\nsouthward IMF turning [Lopez et al., 1999; Slinker et al.,\n2001]. The fast ionospheric response, based on MHD\nsimulations, is attributed to a fast rarefaction wave which\nresides inside of the magnetopause on closed field lines and\nchannels around the Earth [Slinker et al., 2001].\n[17] Studies in favor of the progressive ionospheric\nresponse, on the other hand, have relied on localized\nobservations and they all employed the cross-correlation\nanalysis to the locally obtained data [Lockwood et al., 1986;\nEtemadi et al., 1988; Todd et al., 1988; Saunders et al.,\n1992; Khan and Cowley, 1999]. These studies are the\nobservational basis for the expansion\/contraction model\n[Lockwood et al., 1990; Cowley and Lockwood, 1992;\nLockwood and Cowley, 1999]. According to the model,\nafter the IMF turns southward, magnetic reconnection\ncreates new open field lines on the dayside. These newly\nopened field lines are dragged tailward by the magneto-\nsheath plasma flow with a speed of a few hundred km\/s. At\nthe ionospheric footprints, this tailward motion corresponds\nto the dayside-to-nightside expansion of ionospheric con-\nvection flows of \u00011 km\/s across the polar cap. The\npropagation time from the dayside to the nightside across\nthe polar cap corresponds to the time delay between the\nestablishment of the subsolar magnetopause reconnection\nand that of the magnetotail reconnection following the\nsouthward turning of the IMF.\n[18] As we have demonstrated in Figure 4, the cross-\ncorrelation analysis tends to relate the most prominent\nfeatures between two data sets, such as the peaks of\nmagnetic perturbations. While the onset of the rise in\nmagnetic perturbation is nearly simultaneous, the rising rate\nvaries with latitude and local time. The cross-correlation\nanalysis is thus not suitable for detecting the initial onset,\nrather it tends to depict the final reconfiguration of iono-\nspheric flows. As shown in this paper as well as in the study\nof Murr and Hughes [2001], the final reconfiguration does\nvary with local time: faster on dayside and slower on the\nnightside. Another caveat of cross-correlation analysis is\nthat the two correlated stations may sometimes bare little\noverall resemblance to each other even with a reasonably\nhigh correlation coefficient. For instance, the maximum\ncorrelation coefficients for Umanaq (UMQ)-RBC and God-\nhavn (GDH)-RBC in Figure 6b were \u00010.8, but the overall\nvariations of UMQ and GDH in Figure 5b show very little\nvisual similarity to that of RBC in Figure 5a.\n[19] The expansion\/contraction model expects the polar\ncap boundary to move equatorward first near the dayside\ncusp and subsequently on the nightside following a south-\nward turning of the IMF [Lockwood et al., 1990; Cowley and\nLockwood, 1992; Cowley and Lockwood, 1992]. The motion\nof the polar cap boundary in association with an IMF south-\nward turning has been reported recently by Nishitani et al.\n[2001], who found that the polar cap boundary moved\nequatorward first near local noon and in the premidnight\nsector, and then, 10\u000120 min later, at dusk. It should be\npointed out, however, the polar cap boundary in that study\nwas identified by using three types of totally independent\nobservations, namely, the cusp scatter boundary observed by\nthe Saskatoon HF radar near local noon, the equivalent\ncurrent reversal boundary observed by ground magneto-\nmeters near dusk, and the poleward boundary of the plasma\nsheet precipitating particles measured by the DMSP satel-\nlites. It is therefore likely that the difference in response time\nregarding the equatorward motion of the polar cap boundary\nat the different local time regions may be simply due to the\nfact that the boundaries inferred from the different instru-\nments are not physically identical. In this study, we identify\nthe auroral oval based on global auroral UV images to avoid\npossible confusion regarding the polar cap boundary as\ndefined by different types of observations. Global auroral\nimages show that the initial equatorward motion of the\nauroral oval took place nearly simultaneously from postnoon\nto evening and into the morning sector, coincident with the\nnearly simultaneous (within 2 min) onset of horizontal\nmagnetic perturbations over the entire polar region. But the\nmagnitude of equatorward shift varies with MLTs, ranging\nfrom a relatively small shift (<3\u0001) near local noon and in the\nmorning sector to a large shift (>5\u0001) near dusk and on the\nnightside. The globally coherent response of the auroral oval\nto the IMF southward turning shown in the Polar UV images\nappears to be contrary to the MHD simulations that have\nfound a 20-min time delay for the nightside open-closed\nboundary to move equatorward [Lopez et al., 1999; Slinker\net al., 2001]. We note that the poleward boundary of the main\nLU ET AL.: FAST ONSET AND SLOW RECONFIGURATION SIA 2 - 7\nauroral oval as depicted by the UV images may not coincide\nwith the open-closed boundary at all MLTs. However, the in\nsitu DMSP particle measurements show that at least in the\npostdusk sector the poleward boundary was indeed coinci-\ndent with the open-closed boundary. Another possibility for\nsuch a discrepancy is that the open-closed boundary defined\nfrom the MHD simulations by tracing the actual field lines\nmay not be identical to that based on the low-altitude particle\ncharacteristics.\n[20] Our study has presented a clear evidence for a two-\nstage ionospheric response to the IMF southward turning\nafter it arrives in the high latitude ionosphere. Such a two-\nstage response is a result of the complex interactions of the\nsolar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system. As suggested\nby Ridley et al. [1998], the initial onset of ionospheric\nconvection may be communicated in the form of a fast\nmagnetosonic wave, which is about 1000 km\/s in the high-\nlatitude ionosphere. The slow reconfiguration, on the other\nhand, is controlled mainly by the ionosphere-magneto-\nsphere feedback interaction. Information of the new IMF\nstate propagates in the magnetosphere via a rarefaction\nwave. As shown in global MHD simulations [Slinker et\nal., 2001], the rarefaction wave is concentrated several RE\ninside of the magnetopause. It is associated with tailward\nflow in the noon-midnight plane and sunward flow in the\nequatorial plane to supply magnetic flux to the subsolar\nreconnection. Information about the magnetospheric state is\ncommunicated with the ionosphere via Alfve\u00b4n waves along\nmagnetic field lines. Because the ionosphere is a resistive\nmedia owing to its intrinsic coupling with the neutral\natmosphere, Alfve\u00b4n waves that propagate downward are\npartially reflected by the ionosphere, and the reflection\ncoefficient depends on ionospheric conductivity [Lysak,\n1990]. The combined effects of the magnetospheric com-\nmunication via a rarefaction wave, the ionospheric commu-\nnication via a magnetosonic wave, and most importantly,\nthe feedback interaction between the ionosphere and the\nmagnetosphere, determine the final equilibrium state of\nionospheric convection. It is anticipated that the timescale\nfor the final equilibrium state should be different for the\ndifferent ionospheric regions since ionospheric conductivity\nas well as the magnetospheric magnetic field topology\nchange from one location to another. This concept differs\nfrom the Cowley and Lockwood model in which the iono-\nsphere is treated completely passive. Considering a polar cap\nof circular shape with a 30E diameter, which is probably\nreasonable or even a little conservative for a southward IMF\ncondition, and an average anti-sunward flow speed of 1 km\/s\nacross the polar cap, the time required for the ionosphere to\nreconfigure would be \u00011 hour, not the 15\u201325 min as\nobservations otherwise have shown. To overcome this appa-\nrent time discrepancy, it was suggested that the newly\nopened flux tubes need only to travel a few tens of RE into\nthe tail and the further stretching of the tube produces little\nsubsequent change in the near-Earth system and conse-\nquently will excite little more flow [Lockwood et al., 1990;\nCowley and Lockwood, 1992].\n4. Summary\n[21] Using data from a satellite located at the front of the\nsubsolar magnetopause and a worldwide network of ground\nmagnetometers, we found the time delay between the\nsouthward turning of the IMF near the magnetopause and\nthe initial ionospheric response to be 7 min. The onset of the\ninitial response was nearly simultaneous at 0225 UT (\u00b12\nmin) over the entire polar ionosphere. The Stokkseyri HF\nradar also observed a rapid change of direction of line-of-\nsight velocity at 0225 UT near local midnight. The AMIE\nconvection patterns, especially the residual convection pat-\nterns, clearly show a global, coherent development of two-\ncell convection configuration following the IMF southward\nturning. The foci of convection patterns remained nearly\nsteady, and there was no indication of any dayside to\nnightside propagation in the evolving convection patterns.\nAt the same time, the convection flow continued to intensify\nand the cross-polar-cap potential drop increased. There was\nalso a time delay in the maximum response of magnetic\nperturbations at different locations. The maximum magnetic\nperturbation tended to arrive at high latitudes first and then\nat lower latitudes, but this trend was not obvious at some\nlocal time sectors. The time delay was more pronounced for\na longitudinal magnetometer chain, which clearly displayed\nthat the peak magnetic perturbation was reached first near\nlocal noon then toward the nightside. Such a time delay is\nbest depicted by a cross-correlation analysis. In our case the\ncross-correlation analysis shows a time delay of 25 min in\nthe maximum response between local noon and local mid-\nnight, which can be translated into a dayside-to-nightside\npropagation speed of \u00015 km\/s along the auroral oval.\nGlobal auroral images also show an equatorward motion\nof the central auroral oval after the IMF southward turning.\nWhile the onset of the equatorward shift was nearly simul-\ntaneous at all MLTs (except in the prenoon sector where\naurora were absent), the magnitude of the equatorward shift\ndid vary with MLT, with a relatively small shift near local\nnoon and in the morning sector, and a large shift near dusk\nand on the nightside. Our study strongly suggests a two-\nstage ionospheric response to the IMF changes, consisting\nof the fast initial onset and the slow final reconfiguration.\nSuch a two-stage response is a consequence of the complex\ninterplay of several magnetospheric and ionospheric pro-\ncesses, including a fast rarefaction wave in the magneto-\nsphere, a fast magnetosonic wave in the polar ionosphere,\nand most importantly, the feedback interaction between the\nionosphere and the magnetosphere.\n[22] Acknowledgments.
