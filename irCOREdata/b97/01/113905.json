Polyaniline nanofibres were functionalised post-polymerisation to \nattach either amide or carboxylic acid side-groups. These templates could then be further \nmodified to attach antibodies, specifically in this instance mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG). The \nresultant conjugates were characterised using a variety of techniques including infrared, UV-\nvisible and Raman spectroscopy. Conjugates were then used to detect secondary antibodies (anti-\nIgG). Results from enzyme-linked immunoassay studies indicate successful binding of the \nantibody to the polyaniline nanofibres. Carboxyl functionalised polyaniline nanofibres are shown \nin particular to decrease non-specific binding in the immunoassay. Direct electrical \ncommunication between polyaniline nanofibres covalently linked to peroxidase-labelled \nantibodies was observed during cyclic voltammetry, which demonstrates their potential for \nfurther development as nano-dimensional immunosensors.  \nKeywords: polyaniline nanofibers, conducting polymer functionalization, antibody conjugation, \nimmunoassay \n 3 \n1. Introduction \nConducting polymers combine the advantages of polymers (being lightweight, inexpensive and \neasily processed) with the ability to transport charge [1].  Their unique combination of physical, \noptical and electrical properties, has led to considerable interest in their use as platforms for a \nwide variety of applications. Examples of conducting polymers used in applications \nencompassing electrochromic devices, printable electronics and photochromics include \npolythiophene, polypyrrole and polyaniline [2,3,4]. Polyaniline (PAni) has been previously used \nas a mediator in biosensor applications, due to its inherent electro-activity, favourable charge \nstorage stability and ease of preparation [5,6,7]. Interfacing biomolecules with conducting \npolymers is a logical step in order to accomplish bio-composite materials which can be used for \ncontrolling stimuli-responsive actions involved in drug release, bio-feedback devices, neural \nimplants and artificial muscles [8]. \n \nNanodimensional PAni can be readily prepared, exhibiting markedly improved properties from \nthose of the bulk materials, including increased surface area and sharp switching [9]. The \nproperties unique to one dimensional nanostructures such as nanowires, nanotubes and \nnanofibres have been the focus of much research, partly due to the promise associated with \nnanoscale devices for sensors and electronics. For example Virji et al. [9] howed how PAni \nnanofibre films have far superior performance in both sensor sensitivity and response time in \ncomparison to their bulk counterparts. This is due to faster gas diffusion, enabled by the porous \nhigh-surface area nanofibrillar film structure.  \n \n 4 \nRecently, monolithic microstructures from nanofibers of PAni have been reported [10]. Since the \nporous properties of monolithic polymers can be easily tuned, monolithic capillary columns have \nencountered wide interest for applications in capillary electrochromatography, for example \nfunctionalised monoliths have been used in protein analysis [11]. Using a capillary coated with \npolyaniline achieved the separation of the end products of glycosylation [12]. Relative to packed \ncolumns, monoliths have the advantages of preparation simplicity and availability for surface \nmodification [13,14]. The large surface area of monolithic beds enables a relatively high sample \nloading capacity. The attachment of proteins to affinity columns have seen use in \nimmunopurification, [15] and the detection of selected analytes by chromatographic \nimmunoassays [16]. \n \nThe attachment of biomolecules to conducting polymer nanostructures means that bio-active \nfunctionalities are anchored to a redox active nano-dimensional system. The nanostructured form \nof PAni offers a very large surface-to-volume ratio thus facilitating the immobilisation of a \ngreater number of biomolecules, and an enhancement of sensor sensitivity and response times \n[9,17]. One of the most common methods for immobilising biomolecules onto surfaces achieved \neither physically or by electrochemical techniques, is adsorption [18]. The latter is achieved by \napplying a potential to the electrode surface, which enhances electrostatic interactions and \ntherefore immobilisation [10]. Using adsorption as the method of immobilisation however has \nthe disadvantage that the biomolecule can easily desorb from the surface during use. Conversely, \ncovalent attachment of biomolecules to nanomaterial surfaces ensures sufficient immobilisation \nwithout leaching of the biomolecule from the substrate surface during use [19]. \n \n 5 \nThe authors have recently reported the successful post-synthesis functionalisation of PAni \nnanofibres with mercaptoundecanoic acid and cysteamine; thereby incorporating functional \nhandles (COOH and NH2) which allow for further derivatisation of the polymer [20,21]. Post \nfunctionalisation, PAni maintains its nano-morphology and ability to switch optical, electrical \nand electrochemical properties in response to its immediate chemical environment. In this paper, \nwe describe for the first time how PAni nanofibres modified with either carboxyl or amino \nterminated chains allow for a one step covalent derivatisation of the polymer with biomolecules \n(in particular we demonstrate the technique for antibodies). Biomolecule immobilisation onto \nelectrode surfaces is of importance for the development of enzyme\u2013catalysed biofuel cells, \namperometric biosensors and other biotechnological applications.  Here we report a \u2018generic\u2019 \napproach for immobilisation. PAni-antibody conjugates are of interest as they are low cost and \neasily scalable. The polyaniline serves as an immobilisation matrix and also plays an active role \nin transduction. Alternatively these materials could find application as solid phases in affinity \nmonolithic micro-columns for protein separation. \n \n 6 \n2. Experimental Procedures \n2.1 Chemicals: Aniline (BDH), HCl (Fisher Scientific), ammonium peroxydisulfate (Aldrich), \nmercaptoundecanoic acid (Aldrich), mercaptopropionic acid (Aldrich), cysteamine (Aldrich) and \npH 4 buffer tablets (Fluka) were used. The aniline monomer was purified by vacuum distillation \nbefore use. Mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Sigma), anti-mouse IgG labelled with horse radish \nperoxidase (derived from goat, Sigma), 3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019-tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (TMB, \nSigma) were used as supplied. \n \n2.2 Nanofibre Synthesis: Polyaniline nanofibres were synthesised, under ambient conditions, by \ninterfacial polymerisation between an aqueous and an organic layer, as reported previously [20]. \nThe product was purified by centrifugation (4000 rpm\/5 min\/3 cycles) and suspended as a colloid \nin deionised water. Fibres were modified with mercaptoundecanoic acid (HS(CH2)10COOH), \nmercaptopropionic acid (HS(CH2)2COOH) or cysteamine (HS(CH2)2NH2), by refluxing at 100 \n\u00b0C for 2 hours in an aqueous pH 4 buffer. Four sets of fibres were functionalised; two with \ncysteamine (0.1 mmol and 0.3 mmol) and two with 0.1 mmol carboxyl groups with different \nspacer lengths (C10 and C2). All experiments were carried out under identical conditions using \n~45 mg PAni. The product was purified by centrifugation (4000 rpm\/5 min\/3 cycles) and re-\nsuspended as a colloid in deionised water.  \n \n2.3 Covalent Antibody Immobilisation onto PAni: Briefly, 100 \u00b5l of mouse IgG, at a \nconcentration of 0.1 mg\/ml was added to 1 ml of the PAni nanofibre dispersions (0.2 mg\/ml) for \n1 hour with shaking (200 rpm) at 37 \u00b0C. Antibodies were covalently immobilised by the addition \nof 4 mg ethyl diaminocarbodiimide (EDC), the zero length crosslinker, to the dispersion. The \n 7 \nPAni-IgG mixture was centrifuged and washed in distilled water 3 times. Any remaining \nunreacted sites on the nanofibres were blocked with 5 wt. % milk marvel and incubated \novernight at 4 \u00b0C. The PAni-IgG mixture was then centrifuged (10 min at 4000 rpm) and washed \n3 times with distilled water. Anti-mouse IgG labelled with horse radish peroxidise (HRP) was \ndiluted 1 in 1000 in 1 % (w\/v) milk marvel\/PBS to give a final concentration of 0.6 \u00b5g\/ml and 1 \nml of this solution was added to the PAni-IgG pellet, re-dispersed and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for one \nhour. The PAni mixture was then centrifuged (10 min at 4000 rpm) and washed a further 3 times \nwith water and the PAni pellet re-suspended in 0.5 ml water.  \n \n2.4 Antibody Detection: HRP-labelled antibodies were detected using the 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-\ntetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (TMB) assay prepared as per the manufacturer\u2019s \ninstructions. 200 \u00b5l of TMB solution was added to 250 \u00b5l of the antibody-labelled PAni solution \nand incubated in the dark at room temperature for 10 min. This PAni-TMB dispersion was then \ncentrifuged (10 min at 4000 rpm) and 50 \u00b5l of the supernatant was added to a microtitre well. \nThe reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 \u00b5l of 10% (v\/v) HCl and the absorbance was read \nat 450 nm.  10 \u00b5l of each PAni and PAni\/Ab-HRP suspension was cast as a film onto clean \nglassy carbon electrodes and used as the working electrode in cyclic voltammetry. \n \n2.5 Characterisation: Covalent bonding of side-chains to PAni nanofibres was investigated using \nFourier Transform infrared spectra (FTIR) recorded in transmission mode from 400 to 4000 cm-\n1\n, for 100 repeat scans, with a resolution of 8 cm-1 and at 1 cm-1 intervals on a Perkin Elmer \nSpectrum GX FTIR. Samples were dried under vacuum at 50 \u00b0C for 4 hours prior to FTIR and \nthen mixed with dried KBr. Dedoped samples were also analysed using solid state nuclear \n 8 \nmagnetic resonance (SSNMR). 13C spectra were obtained using a Varian VNMRS spectrometer \noperating at 100.56 MHz for carbon, and spectra are referenced to tetramethylsilane. Thermal \nGravimetric Analysis (TGA) decomposition curves were obtained using a Mettler-Toledo \nTGA\/SDTA851. Samples were heated from 25-700 \u00b0C at 10 \u00b0C\/minute under nitrogen. \nNanofibres were coated with 10 nm Au\/Pd and imaged using field emission scanning electron \nmicroscopy (FESEM) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV on a S-4300 Hitachi system. Raman \nspectroscopy was carried out on an Avalon 785 nm Raman spectrometer at 2 cm-1 resolution, 3 \nseconds per scan and 10-20 collections. A 785 nm laser line was used as it can detect both doped \nand de-doped PAni features. UV-vis spectroscopy was carried out on a Perkin Elmer UV-vis \nNIR Lambda 900 Spectrometer at 1 nm resolution. Characterisation of the samples by enzyme \nassay was obtained using a Tecan Sunrise microplate reader. Absorbance readings were taken at \na wavelength of 450 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed \nusing a Jeol 2100 microscope (200 kV). Cyclic voltammetry was performed using an eDAQ e-\ncorder (401) and potentiostat\/galvanostat (EA 160) with Chart v5.1.2\/EChem v 2.0.2 software \n(ADInstruments), and a PC computer, in phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS - 0.2 M, pH \n7.4) with Ag\/AgCl reference electrode and platinum mesh counter electrode. \n 9 \n3. Results and Discussion \n3.1 Preparation and Characterisation of Functionalised PAni Nanofibres \nPolyaniline nanofibres were synthesised by interfacial polymerisation, whereby the aniline \nmonomer was dissolved in toluene and the oxidant (ammonium persulfate) was dissolved in 1M \nhydrochloric acid. Polyaniline nanofibres form at the interface between these two solutions and \nprecipitate into the aqueous layer where they can be collected and purified. These nanofibres \nwere then surface modified with either carboxylic acid or amine groups (for details see Table 1). \nThe extent of this functionalisation could be controllably altered [21]. Covalent attachment was \nverified using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), where a band centred around \n3400 cm-1 reflects attachment of the amide group, and a band at 1700 cm-1 confirms the presence \nof an acid group (Figure 1). Polymer functionalisation was verified by peak shift and the \nelimination of thiol bands (Figure 1, supporting information). \n \nCovalent functionalisation was also verified using cross-polarization magic angle spinning solid-\nstate nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR). The spectrum obtained for unmodified PAni is \nconsistent with spectra in the literature [22], and predominant 13C peaks appear at 123.84 ppm, \n156.73 ppm and 137.25 ppm (Figure 2a, Supporting Information). For carboxylic acid \nfunctionalised PAni (PAni-C10COOH) two additional peaks are present, one at 29.4 ppm, which \ncan be assigned to the aliphatic carbon chain of the mercaptoundecanoic acid (SH(CH2)10COOH) \nsubstituent, and the other at 180.3 ppm, which can be assigned to the carbon of the carboxylic \nacid group (Figure 2b, Supporting Information). For cysteamine functionalised PAni (PAni-\nNH2), characteristic PAni peaks appear. Unfortunately, the absorbance band of the C-N \ncysteamine (HS(CH2)2NH2) amide is masked by the C-N bonds along the PAni backbone, and \n 10 \ntherefore cannot be isolated (Figure 2c, Supporting Information). The SSNMR spectra confirm \nthe formation of PAni-COOH nanofibres, and are consistent with the formation of PAni-NH2 \nnanofibres. \n \nResults obtained by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) are also consistent with nanofibre \nfunctionalisation. These reveal that PAni, PAni-C10COOH and PAni-NH2 have different \ndecomposition profiles (Figure 2). Unmodified polyaniline decomposes over a temperature \nrange between 300 \u00b0C and 620 \u00b0C, while other decomposition peaks outside this temperature \nrange can be attributed to trapped solvent\/dopant in the material [21]. In contrast to this, \nfunctionalised nanofibres show two significant areas of decomposition. For PAni-C10COOH \nthe peak centred at 504 \u00b0C is consistent with a PAni component, while the second peak at \n196 \u00b0C is due to a modified PAni-C10COOH surface component (ca. 10 wt%). In the case of \nPAni-NH2 B, decomposition peaks appear at 558 \u00b0C due to the PAni component, while the  \namide-modified surface component manifests at 184 \u00b0C (ca. 19wt%). These TGA results are \nin agreement with previously published data which shows that the degree of nanofibre \nfunctionalisation can be controlled for both PAni-COOH and PAni-NH2. \n \n3.2 Antibody immobilisation\n \nCovalent immobilisation of antibodies onto functionalised polyaniline (PAni) nanofibres was \ninvestigated and involved attachment of antibodies to both carboxyl and amino functionalised \nPAni nanofibres (Pani-COOH and Pani-NH2 respectively). To determine the effect of chain \nlength on antibody immobilisation, carboxyl functionalised PAni nanofibres with two carbon \n(PAni-(CH2)2-COOH), and ten carbon (PAni-(CH2)10-COOH) spacer chains were examined. In \n 11 \nthe case of amine functionalised PAni nanofibres, two different concentrations of cysteamine \nwere used to compare the effect of amino-group density with respect to antibody immobilisation \n(products from 0.1 mmol and 0.3 mmol cysteamine reactions are denoted Pani-C2NH2 A and \nPani-C2NH2 B, respectively, see Table 1). \n \nFor the immobilisation, both types of PAni-COOH and PAni-NH2 dispersions were mixed with \nthe primary antibody, mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG), and the cross linker ethyl \ndiaminocarbodiimide (EDC). A range of blocking agents were tested (ovalbumin, bovine serum \nalbumin (BSA), Tween 20\u00ae, BSA\/milk marvel (1:1), milk marvel, gelatin, Super Block\u00ae, KLH \nprotein and soya milk) and the results indicate that milk marvel was the most effective blocking \nagent against non-specific binding (See figure 3, supporting Information). Milk marvel therefore \nwas used for all PAni samples tested. As future work will involve adaptation of this method for a \nsandwich immunoassay, an unlabelled antibody was immobilised onto the PAni nanofibres. \n \n3.3 Characterisation of antibody conjugates \nThe nanofibre morphology of PAni can be verified using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). \nNanofibres synthesised by interfacial polymerisation have a uniform diameter distribution and a \nhigh surface area, thus making them ideal for use as a sensing platform. Post-functionalisation, \nthe nanofibre morphology appears essentially unaffected. However, greater aggregation of the \nnanofibres is observed following antibody immobilisation, which results in an apparently less \nporous film structure (Figure 3). This is analogous to functionalisation of PAni with carboxyl \nand amino groups, in that the degree of aggregation scales with the level of functionalisation \n[20]. Films do however maintain a high surface-to-volume ratio in comparison with bulk PAni. \n 12 \nThe surface topography of the nanofibres appears altered suggesting that the attachment of \nbiomolecules was successful. \n \nFunctionalisation affects the delocalised bonding along the PAni polymer backbone, and this can \nbe monitored by analysing spectroscopic changes in the materials (in particular UV-vis and \nRaman spectra were examined). For UV-vis spectra, a polaron band at 450 nm with a free carrier \ntail above 600 nm indicates that PAni is in the doped (emeraldine salt, therefore conductive) state \n[23]. For a dedoped (emeraldine base, therefore non-conductive) state these bands disappear and \na pi-pi* transition band at 341 nm dominates, with a band at 660cm-1 due to the quinoid fraction of \nthe PAni backbone [24]. For unmodified PAni in an aqueous environment the material remains \nin the doped form (Figure 4). However, with functionalised PAni-NH2 and PAni-COOH in an \naqueous environment, features of the dedoped state begin to emerge. This is due to the fact that \nfunctionalisation disrupts the delocalised pi-system of chemical bonds along the PAni polymer \nbackbone. For PAni-antibody conjugates, further dedoping of the material is observed due to the \nhigher pH environment that the nanofibres are exposed to during conjugation. Aromatic amino \nacids associated with antibodies absorb strongly near 280 nm and a peak corresponding to this is \nclearly seen for all spectra of the PAni-antibody conjugates. Therefore UV-vis results suggest \nthat antibody functionalisation was successful. \n \nThe dedoped state of PAni-antibody conjugates was also reflected in Raman spectra of the \nmaterial (Figure 4, Supporting Information). Spectra of PAni in the doped conductive state have \nsignature bands between 1300-1400 cm-1, and these are present for PAni-NH2. Strong bands \n 13 \nbetween 1400-1500 cm-1 reflect a transition to the dedoped state, and these emerge for the PAni-\nNH2-antibody conjugate.  \n \nThe electrochemical behaviour of carboxyl- and amino-functionalised PAni nanofibres (without \nantibodies attached) deposited on glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs) was studied by cyclic \nvoltammetry in 0.2M KCl (pH 1), and the results are shown in Figure 5(a and b). Two pairs of \nredox peaks centred at approximately +0.20 and +0.70 V corresponding to the transformation of \nleucoemeraldine base to emeraldine salt and emeraldine salt to pernigraniline salt, respectively, \ncan be observed for all PAni nanofibre samples. The presence of covalently bound acid \nfunctionalities along the polymer backbone does not appreciably alter the electrochemical \nbehaviour of polyaniline nanofibres. As expected, redox behaviour is similar to that of PAni for \nlow levels of functionalisation. However, increasing the levels of functionalisation, as previously \ndiscovered, affects the electrochemical properties of the material and is observed in the case of \namino functionalised PAni (Figure 5b).  With increasing PAni functionalisation, the numbers of \nunfunctionalised quinoid rings along the PAni backbone decrease and CV scans show an \nincreased redox pair peak separation. This is caused by higher levels of functionalisation \ndisrupting the delocalised pi-bonding of the polymer network, and hence the oxidation potential \nof the material.  \n \nThe electrochemical behaviour of antibody-functionalised PAni nanofibres deposited on GCEs \nwas also studied by cyclic voltammetry in 0.2M KCl (pH 1, Figure 5). The presence of \nconjugated antibodies on the PAni nanofibres caused a shift in the peak potentials of the second \nredox pair to approximately +0.55 V. It is known that the second oxidation peak of polyaniline \n 14 \nmoves to a less positive potential with increasing pH. The shift to +0.55 V may be due to the \npresence of conjugated antibodies adjacent to polymer chains, changing the local chemical and \nhence electrochemical environment of the polymer. \n \n3.4 Immobilisation of secondary antibodies\n \nA secondary antibody, anti-mouse IgG labelled with HRP (derived from goat) was used in order \nto detect the presence of the immobilised primary antibody (Scheme 1). The secondary antibody \nwas incubated with the primary antibody-modified PAni nanofibres. PAni nanofibre antibody \nconjugates (PAni-C2COOH, PAni-C10COOH, PAni-NH2 A and PAni-NH2 B) were assayed using \nthe colorimetric tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) enzyme assay. The presence of antibodies on PAni \nnanofibre samples can be confirmed by the TMB assay results (Figure 6). Levels of antibody \nfunctionalisation across samples appear broadly similar with the carboxyl functionalised \nnanofibres exhibiting the least non-specific binding (NSB). In antibody-based assays, the surface \nhas to be treated to minimise non-specific adsorption. NSB controls the background response and \noften results in a detection limit that is much higher than that defined by the equilibrium \nconstants for antibody-antigen binding events. NSB for the amine-functionalised nanofibres was \nreduced by increasing the level of nanofibre functionalisation, but not to the level of carboxyl \nfunctionalised PAni nanofibres.  \n \nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the PAni-antibody conjugates reveal that \nthe morphology of the PAni nanofibres remains largely unaffected by the antibody conjugation \nprocess (Figure 7). TEM imaging, however, is consistent with modification of nanofibre \nsurfaces, as indicated by an apparent increase in surface roughness. For HRP-labelled PAni-\n 15 \nantibody conjugates, dark spheres on the surface of the nanofibres can be observed, consistent \nwith the size of HRP labels (Figure 7d). EDXS analysis on films of these PAni-antibody \nconjugates confirms the presence of iron from the metal centre of the HRP enzyme label on the \nsecondary antibody (Figure 5, Supporting Information). \n \nElectrochemical characterisation of PAni nanofibres functionalised with the secondary antibody, \nHRP-labelled anti-mouse IgG, was carried out in phosphate buffered saline as electrolyte (pH \n7.4, to prevent antibody denaturation). Figure 8 shows the cyclic voltammograms obtained from \nsamples drop cast as films on GCEs. Polyaniline typically loses its electroactivity in solutions \nwith increasing pH, as the emeraldine salt is dedoped to form the insulator emeraldine base. As \nexpected, no clear redox responses were observed from PAni control samples without the \nprimary antibody covalently attached. PAni nanofibres without the primary antibody covalently \nattached are not expected to specifically bind the redox active HRP-labelled anti-mouse IgG. As \nverified by the TMB assay results, minimal non-specific binding of this protein to the PAni \nnanofibres is observed.  \n \nIn contrast, an obvious, stable redox couple (anodic peak (+0.22 V) and cathodic peak (+0.09 V)) \nwas observed for PAni samples functionalised with both primary (mouse IgG) and HRP-labelled \nsecondary antibodies (anti-mouse IgG). This redox couple may be attributed to the iron centre of \nthe HRP enzyme (Figure 8). In a control experiment, an electrode was constructed by drop \ncasting 5 \u00b5l of carboxy-modified PAni in water onto a glassy carbon electrode and allowing it to \ndry. Following this, 5 \u00b5l of a 1mg\/ml solution of HRP (no primary or seconday \nantibody) in PBS was drop cast onto the PAni modified GCE. Cyclic voltammetry of this control \n 16 \nsample in PBS (not shown) exhibited a stable redox couple at approximately +0.20 V. This \nconfirms that the redox couple obtained with the PAni nanofibres functionalised with HRP-\nlabelled anti-mouse IgG was definitely due to the HRP moiety. These results strongly suggest \nthat direct electron transfer was achieved between the PAni nanofibres and the covalently \nbioconjugated peroxidase enzymes. \n \n4. Conclusion \nThe covalent attachment of antibodies to conducting polymer nanofibres was successfully \ndemonstrated. Attachment can be achieved using a controllable and relatively simple process, \nwhich can easily be scaled up for bulk production. Antibody conjugates can then be used to \ndetect the presence of secondary antibodies. HRP-labelled antibodies can also be attached, thus \nsuggesting potential application in nanostructured immunosensors for point of care detection. For \nclinically relevant point of care immunoassays, non-specific adsorption must be minimised, and \nin particular carboxyl functionalised polyaniline nanofibres were shown to decrease non-specific \nbinding in the immunoassay. This platform could be further developed to attach other enzymes, \nantibodies and oligonucleotides. Thus providing a material which is if interest for a range of \napplications including affinity columns for protein separation, biosensors, biofuel cells and \nbioelectronic systems. \n \nAcknowledgment \nThis material is based upon research supported by the Science Foundation Ireland under Grant \nNo. 05\/CE3\/B754.
