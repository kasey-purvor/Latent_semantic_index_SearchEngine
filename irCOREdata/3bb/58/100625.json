INTRODUCTION\nDue to the short pulse duration and high power density of\nthe excimer lasers, they can be used to rapidly introduce\nsignificant amounts of heat into a solid. The ablation, melt-\ning, and fast recrystallization produced by laser irradiation\nare processes which are widely exploited for a multitude of\nmaterials processing techniques. One such application is the\ncrystallization of amorphous Si.1 In addition, the effect of\nshort pulse laser irradiation on metals is important for under-\nstanding material processing techniques such as laser ma-\nchining and welding, and for obtaining high-temperature\nthermophysical data. The rapid heating and subsequent phase\ntransitions that occur during short pulse irradaition can be\ncomplex, and have been the subject of theoretical and experi-\nmental investigations.2\u20135 However, the majority of these\nstudies of laser irradiation of materials concentrate on the\nsurface melting and ablation of thick films and do not con-\nsider the effect of the material-substrate interaction.\nOnce a thin film is molten, instability driven breakup into\ndroplets may be expected if the liquid phase poorly wets the\nsubstrate. This is similar to the island formation observed\nduring the thermal annealing of thin metal films, such as Ni.\nHere a weak interaction between the metal and the oxide\nlayer results in a low activation energy barrier for metal mi-\ngration, even at temperatures well below the melting point of\nthe metal.6,7 In thin film deposition the growth of nanostruc-\ntured surfaces depends on the growth mode. Layer-by-layer\nor two-dimensional \u00012D\u0002 growth is called the Frank\u2013Van der\nMerwe mode,8 3D island growth occurs in the so-called\nVolmer-Weber mode,7,9 and initial 2D growth of a few\nmonolayers thick wetting layer, followed by 3D growth, is\nreferred to as the Stranski-Krastanow mode.10 The growth\nmode that occurs is influenced by the relative weight of the\nfree enthalpy of the substrate surface, that of the surface of\nthe film, and of the interface between the film and the sub-\nstrate. Similarly, during the thermal annealing of thin films,\nthe morphological stability and fragmentation dynamics are\nalso controlled by the free enthalpy. For very thin metal films\non oxide surfaces, where the metal does not react readily\nwith the oxide, this break up during thermal annealing allows\nthe self-assembly of supported nanoparticle arrays.6,11 Here,\nthe enthalpy of formation of the metal oxide is a critical\nparameter determining the relaxation dynamics, but are simi-\nlar effects expected during the short pulse laser melting of\nthin metal-on-oxide films?\nNanoparticle systems currently attract considerable inter-\nest from both academia and industry, due to their interesting\nand diverse properties, which deviate from those of the bulk.\nMetal nanoparticles and other metal nanostructures are the\nbasic building blocks in photonics research12 and it is ex-\npected that magnetic nanoparticles will have a dramatic im-\npact on high density magnetic recording13 and radar-\nabsorbing composite applications.14 Transition metal\nnanoparticles, such as Ni, Co, Fe, and Au are of considerable\nimportance for the catalytic growth of nanostructures includ-\ning carbon nanotubes11,15,16 and silicon nanowires.17 Nano-\nparticle systems are also of significant interest to the fuel cell\ncommunity, working to increase the reaction surface for a\nfixed cell volume. Nanoparticle systems can be fabricated by\na large range of different techniques including chemical\nreduction,18 laser ablation,19 thermal evaporation,20 ion\nimplantation,21 and thermal annealing.6,11\nIn this paper we investigate the physical mechanisms be-\nhind the pulsed laser melting of thin metal-on-oxide film and\nuse this technique, entitled excimer laser nanostructuring\n\u0001ELN\u0002, to produce supported metal nanoparticles, with con-\ntrollable dimensions, over large area and at low macroscopic\ntemperatures. Previously, we demonstrated that ELN of thin\nNi films can be used to produce nanoscopic Ni catalyst par-\nticles suitable for the growth of carbon nanotubes.16 Here we\nexamine the underlying mechanisms of the ELN technique\nmore closely, for a carefully chosen selection of metals with\ndiffering physical and thermodynamic properties, and differ-\ning enthalphies of formation for the oxide. We discuss how\nthis process differs from the traditional thermal annealing\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 72, 195408 \u00012005\u0002\n1098-0121\/2005\/72\u000119\u0002\/195408\u000110\u0002\/$23.00 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society195408-1\nmethod of producing nanostructured metal-on-oxide sub-\nstrates and compare the experimental data obtained during\nELN of thin metal films with simulations of the heat transfer.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe ELN of a variety of metal thin films on SiO2\/Si sub-\nstrates was investigated in order to determine what materials\nand laser parameters are required to produce metal nanopar-\nticles. The initial thin films were produced by pulsed laser\nablation22,23 \u0001PLA\u0002 of a high purity metal targets \u0001all materi-\nals had a purity \u000299.9%\u0002. A Lambda-Physik LPX 210i ex-\ncimer laser, producing 25 ns pulses at 248 nm, was used for\nthe ablation. The growth chamber was evacuated using a\nturbo pump to 9\u000310\u22128 Torr and the typical laser fluence\nused was 10 J \/cm2. The metals investigated here were Au,\nAg, Ni, Mo, Ti, and Zn. The growth rate for each metal was\ncalibrated by measuring the thickness of a range of films,\ndeposited with different numbers of laser shots, by a combi-\nnation of atomic force microscopy \u0001AFM\u0002 and profilometry.\nSome of the films have a low density of hydrodynami-\ncally \u201csplashed\u201d micron-sized droplets, which are typical for\npulsed laser deposited films,22 but in general the films were\nvery smooth. The PLA technique has been used to deposit\nvery smooth films for a wide variety of metals. For very thin\nfilms \u0001\u00045 nm\u0002 island growth is observed in some systems,\nhowever in general at high fluences like those used here, the\nhigh flux of energetic \u0001hundreds of electron volts\u0002 metal at-\noms and ions produces smooth films and in some cases epi-\ntaxial growth.24 By reducing the kinetic energy of the growth\nspecies, e.g., by introducing He during the growth,25 nano-\nstructured films can be deposited directly for some metals.\nHowever, above a few nanometers thick, these films consist\nof conglomerated, rather than isolated, nanoparticles. The\nsurface roughness of a selection of the films was examined in\nthe AFM and was typically \u00041 nm. Thin films with thick-\nness in the range 5\u201320 nm were then deposited onto a SiO2\nlayer of 235 nm thickness, thermally grown on a Si substrate,\nfor subsequent laser processing.\nThe thin films were ELN using the same excimer laser as\nemployed for the deposition, by diverting the optical path\nand passing it through a homogenizer, producing a laser spot\nwith a Gaussian energy profile along one axis, the peak flu-\nence of the profile being \u0003 1.5 times the average. The films\nwere transferred to a separate vacuum stage \u0001typical working\npressure 10\u22124 Torr\u0002 where the whole sample could be an-\nnealed by translating the stage. Typical translation rate was\n1 mm\/s with a laser repetition rate of 10 Hz. The number of\nlaser pulses any area receives is \u000350 but due to the Gaussian\nbeam profile, only the area at the central part of the beam\nreceives the full laser energy. Post-annealing the structure of\nthe films was investigated in a Hitachi S4000 field emission\ngun scanning electron microscope \u0001SEM\u0002 with a spatial reso-\nlution of 1.5 nm. The size distribution of any metal nanopar-\nticles produced was obtained using commercial image analy-\nsis software.26\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Effect of film thickness and laser fluence\nThe Ni on SiO2 system is typically classified as a rela-\ntively unreactive pair,27,28 as Ni, compared to more reactive\nmetals, does not readily form an oxide \u0001the heat of formation\nof the oxide is \u2212241 kJ mol\u22121\u0002. The melting point of Ni, of\n1728 K, is also intermediate between the very high and very\nlow melting point metals. Thus this system is an ideal start-\ning point to investigate the laser induced nanostructuring of\nthin metal films. Figures 1\u0001a\u0002\u20131\u0001d\u0002 show a series of SEM\nimages of a selection of the laser annealed films, with differ-\nent initial Ni thickness, grown on 320 nm SiO2\/Si\nsubstrates.16 The ELN was performed at laser fluences of\n\u0003200 mJ\/cm2. After exposure to the laser the Ni film was\nobserved to have melted and then broken up into discrete\nnanometer-scale hemispherical islands. The fluence required\nto achieve this breakup was a function of the initial film\nthickness and the thickness of the oxide layer on the sub-\nstrate. Higher laser fluences were required to nanostructure\nthe thinner Ni films. This indicates that we are in a region\nwhere the heat conduction out of the film into the substrate is\nsignificant. At lower fluences the films were observed to per-\nforate, but the breakup into discrete droplets was incomplete.\nThese measurements were repeated for Ni films deposited\nonto Si substrates with a thinner oxide later. The fluences\nrequired to nanostructure the films grown on the thinner 235\nnm thermal SiO2 substrates were higher than for the corre-\nsponding Ni film on the thicker 320 nm SiO2 layers. This\nconfirms the importance of heat conduction during the dura-\ntion of the laser pulse. At fluences higher than the threshold\nfor breakup, no change in the Ni droplet size distribution was\nobserved; the defining parameter which determines the drop-\nlet size was the film thickness. However, the maximum flu-\nence achievable by the optical system was 700 mJ\/cm2, so\nwe could only investigate the effect of laser fluence up to this\nvalue. Figure 1\u0001e\u0002 shows a plot of the mean particle diameter\nfor the ELN of Ni films as a function of initial film thickness.\nThe mean particle diameter is observed to increase as the\ninitial film thickness increases. The relationship between the\ndiameter and the film thickness will be discussed in more\ndetail later.\nIn order to investigate the general properties of the ELN\nof thin metal films, the measurements were repeated for a\nrange of different metals including Au, Ag, Mo, Zn, and Ti.\nThis range of materials were chosen as they have properties\nwhich span a wide range of values and span different classes\nof metals. For example, Zn and Mo have melting points that\ndiffer by a large amount \u0001693 K for Zn compared to 2905 K\nfor Mo\u0002. Also, Au and Ti are examples of metals that hardly\noxidize and readily form an oxide, respectively, so should\ngive us a good insight into the effects of the metal-substrate\ninteraction on the ELN. Films with a thickness of 5, 10, 15,\nand 20 nm were deposited for all these metals, on 235 nm\nSiO2\/Si substrates, and were subsequently laser irradiated at\nfluences in the range 75\u2013700 mJ\/cm2. Figure 2 shows SEM\nimages of ELN Mo films \u0001a\u0002 before, \u0001b\u0002 close to, and \u0001c\u0002 after\nthe threshold fluence for nanostructuring. Note the initial\nfilm in \u0001a\u0002 and \u0001c\u0002 was 20 nm thick and in \u0001b\u0002 15 nm thick.\nThe laser fluence was around 660 mJ\/cm2 in all cases. Just\nbelow the break-up threshold the films perforate and the mol-\nten film around these perforations is observed to have drawn\naway from the center of the hole \u0004as is shown in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002\u0005.\nThese perforations are likely to occur at thickness inhomo-\ngeneities in the film, as the fluence required for melting is\nHENLEY, CAREY, AND SILVA PHYSICAL REVIEW B 72, 195408 \u00012005\u0002\n195408-2\npredicted to be lower for thicker films. This will be discussed\nin more detail later. When the density of perforations is high,\nthe retreating molten film between two holes can coalesce\ninto filaments, as is shown in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002. At fluences slightly\nhigher than the threshold these filaments, or liquid metal\nnanowires, can then split into droplets possibly due to the\nRayleigh instability29 which has been recently observed ex-\nperimentally for thermally annealed Cu nanowires on SiO2\nsurfaces.30 A clear example of these chains of droplets can be\nseen for Ni in Fig. 1\u0001d\u0002. The fluence required to melt the Mo\nfilms is much higher than that for the same thickness of Ni,\nmainly a consequence of its higher melting point \u00011718 K for\nNi compared to 2905 K for Mo\u0002.31 The propensities for oxide\nformation are similar for the two metals, thus the comparison\ninvestigates the effects of the differing thermal properties of\nthe metals, rather than the metal-substrate interaction.\nIn order to investigate the effects of ELN at fluences\nmuch greater than the break-up threshold it was decided next\nto look at thin Au and Ag films, which have lower melting\npoints than Ni or Mo. Figure 3 shows two sequences of SEM\nimages of the ELN of \u0001a\u0002\u2013\u0001d\u0002 and 15 nm thick Ag \u0001e\u0002\u2013\u0001h\u0002\nfilms. The fluences used on the Au films were \u0001a\u0002 0 mJ\/cm2,\ni.e., unannealed to show that the film is continuous and\nsmooth on this scale, \u0001b\u0002 125 mJ\/cm2, \u0001c\u0002 250 mJ\/cm2, \u0001d\u0002\n430 mJ\/cm2, and for Ag \u0001e\u0002 0 mJ\/cm2, \u0001f\u0002 150 mJ\/cm2, \u0001g\u0002\n300 mJ\/cm2, and \u0001h\u0002 400 mJ\/cm2. The initial sequence of\nperforation and breakup into droplets was similar for Au and\nAg as was observed for Ni and Mo. However, well above the\nthreshold \u0004see Figs. 3\u0001c\u0002 and 3\u0001g\u0002\u0005 smaller droplets are ob-\nserved around the larger ones. At the highest fluences studied\n\u0004see Figs. 3\u0001d\u0002 and 3\u0001h\u0002\u0005 all the large droplets are gone and\nare replaced by a high density of much smaller droplets.\nStatistical analysis of the Ag nanoparticle diameter distribu-\ntions produced by the ELN of a 5 nm Ag thin films at flu-\nences of \u0001a\u0002 175 mJ\/cm2, \u0001b\u0002 250 mJ\/cm2,\u0001c\u0002 400 mJ\/cm2,\nand \u0001d\u0002 600 mJ\/cm2 are shown in Fig. 4. From these distri-\nbutions we can observe a shift of the distribution from a\nmean diameter of 43 nm down to 17 nm, as the fluence is\nincreased. The larger diameter droplets fragment into smaller\ndroplets, at higher temperatures, possibly as they boil. By\nexamining the size distribution for the larger droplets, pro-\nduced at lower fluences, as a function of film thickness \u0001not\nshown here\u0002 it is seen that the mean size is again dependent\non the initial film thickness. However, the mean size of the\ndroplets produced at high fluence is relatively insensitive to\nthe film thickness. It appears that, at the higher relative flu-\nences, it is possible to start to evaporate the droplets and at\nthe highest fluences, to fully ablate away the film, leaving a\ndistribution of nanoparticles only formed as the last of the\nfilm boils away. Indeed, at the highest fluences used, a thin\ncoating was observed on the glass of the laser annealing\nchamber opposite the films, indicating that the material had\nbeen ablated.\nFIG. 1. \u0001a\u0002\u2013\u0001d\u0002 SEM images of ELN Ni films\nwith different thicknesses. \u0001a\u0002 6.5 nm thick film,\n\u0001b\u0002 8.2 nm, \u0001c\u0002 11.5 nm, and \u0001d\u0002 15 nm.

Effect of metal-substrate interaction\nVery similar behavior was observed for the four different\nmetals discussed until now. It is thus feasible to question if\nthis is a general property for the metal\/SiO2 system. Figure 5\nshows SEM images of the metal droplets produced by the\nELN of \u0001a\u0002 a 20 nm Au film, \u0001b\u0002 a 0 nm Ag film, \u0001c\u0002 a 15 nm\nNi film, and \u0001d\u0002 a 20 nm Mo film. The samples have been\ntilted to show the droplets side on. The poor wetting of the\nSiO2 by the liquid noble metal droplets is evidenced by the\nlarge contact angle between the droplet and the substrate. For\nNi and Mo, the wetting is improved and the contact angle is\nreduced. Experimental contact angles for metal droplets on\nionocovalent oxide substrates have been obtained from\nsessile drop measurements.27 From these measurements the\ncontact angles for the Ag\/SiO2 and Ni\/SiO2 systems are\ngiven as \u0003140\u00b0 and \u0003120\u00b0, respectively. For the droplets\nproduced in this study the contact angles are estimated from\na series of images similar to those shown in Fig. 5. The\nvalues obtained were \u0003120\u00b0 for Au, 118\u00b0 for Ag, 105\u00b0 for\nNi, and 72\u00b0 for Mo. In the case of Ti\/MgO however, forma-\ntion of Ti oxide at the interface is expected27 and the metal-\noxide pair is classified as reactive, where the resultant con-\ntact angle is 0\u00b0 and the metal wets the oxide. Figure 6 shows\na SEM image of a 20 nm thick Ti film \u0001a\u0002 before and \u0001b\u0002 after\nlaser irradiation at 250 mJ\/cm2. Although melting and\nroughening of the surface is clearly evident after irradiation,\nno droplet production is observed even at the highest flu-\nences available. The melting point and thermodynamic prop-\nerties of Ti are more favorable for melting than those of Mo\n\u0001for example, the melting point is 1941 K and its thermal\nconductivity is only 0.22 W cm\u22121 K\u22121\u0002, but no breakup into\nnanodroplets is observed. Similar behavior is observed for\nthe Zn\/SiO2 system. The melting point of Zn is very low\n\u0001693 K\u0002 but still no droplet formation is observed. This sug-\ngests that the interfacial metal-substrate interaction is critical\nfor nanoparticle production by this method. To examine this\nmore carefully we can compare the enthalpy of formation of\nthe oxides \u2212\u0005Hf for the metals in question. These data, and\nthe values for a selection of other elements are shown in\nTable I. Of the metals studied here, the ones that break up\ninto droplets \u0001Au, Ag, Ni, and Mo\u0002 are all in the top half of\nTable I, with \u2212\u0005Hf\u0004300 kJ mol\u22121. Those that wet the sub-\nstrate \u0001Zn and Ti\u0002 have \u2212\u0005Hf\u0002300 kJ mol\u22121. From Fig. 5,\nthe observed contact angles between the metal drops and the\nSiO2 substrate are observed to decrease as the value of \u2212\u0005Hf\nfor the metal increases. For example Au, which does not\nreadily form an oxide, produces near spherical droplets\nwhereas Mo, which has a larger heat of formation, produces\ndroplets with a contact angle less than 90\u00b0. Of course, \u0005Hf is\nnot the only parameter affecting the wetting, and we should\nalso consider others including the work of adhesion.27 How-\never, it appears for this application that \u0005Hf is a critical\nparameter and the breakup into droplets is controlled by the\nmetal-substrate interaction.\nC. Simulation\nBefore the breakup into droplets is possible, the film must\nfirst be brought to its melting point. It is important therefore,\nto consider the heat transfer that occurs during the pulsed\nlaser melting of thin films. When laser photons are incident\non a solid, the energy is typically absorbed by electronic\nexcitations. These excitations rapidly decay and the energy is\nconverted to heat over a time scale of the order of a few\npicoseconds.32 The rapid heating and subsequent phase tran-\nsitions can be complex, and have been the subject of theo-\nretical and experimental investigations.2,4,5 With the pulse\nduration of the excimer lasers typically being a few tens of\nnanoseconds, we can describe the temperature changes that\noccur in the solid using the heat conduction equation, by\nintroducing a source term. As the power density is uniform\nover the irradiated area, which is large compared to the film\nthickness, the heat conduction can be considered only in one\nspatial dimension.

When heat conduction is considered, for\nthin films where d\u00041\/\u0007, a region of the substrate deter-\nmined by the thermal diffusion depth of SiO2 will also be\nheated. The heat Q absorbed in the metal will also have to\nheat this region. Thus, the fluence required to melt the film\nwill increase with decreasing d. For thicker films \u0001d\u00021\/\u0007\u0002,\nheat conduction into the substrate will be significantly slower\nand lower melting fluences would be expected. When\nd\n1\/\u0007 partial melting of the top surface of the film should\noccur.\nIn order to model the system, Eq. \u00011\u0002 can be solved ana-\nlytically under the assumption of no phase change occurring\nand that the thermal properties of the film remain constant.\nHowever, the thermal conductivity and heat capacity are both\ntemperature dependent and we are considering a phase\nchange from solid to liquid.

The data used for the simu-\nlation is shown in Table II. The choice of \u0005z is crucial for\nthis method to converge to the solution of Eq. \u00011\u0002. If \u0005z\n\n1\/\u0007, then the simulation averages out the temperature rise\nthat would have occurred at finer resolutions near the surface\nof the film. If \u0005z is too small then the temperature differen-\ntials between adjacent layers can be too large for the simu-\nlation to converge to the solution. For every order of magni-\ntude finer spatial resolution, we require a two orders of\nmagnitude finer temporal resolution to compensate. For the\nsimulations presented later, the typical slice thickness \u0005z\nused was \u00031\/2\u0007 for the material in question. Thus, only a\nfew layers were used in each simulation. The high thermal\nconductivity of the metal means that the film is essentially all\nat the same temperature throughout its depth and the tem-\nperature gradient is only large at the interface. The number of\nlayers used for the metal does not have to be large to ad-\nequately model the system. Here we have used more layers\nfor the substrate, where the temperature gradient is generally\nlarger. The substrate was modeled as 12 SiO2 layers \u0001with a\ntotal thickness of 240 nm to match with the oxide thickness\nused in the experiments\u0002 with its own temperature dependent\nthermal properties. However, the bottom layer had its tem-\nperature fixed at room temperature and hence acts as a heat\nsink rendering the substrate effectively infinite in extent.\nNow that a reasonable idea of the critical parameters has\nbeen obtained, our goal is to develop a predictive model that\ncould be employed to estimate the threshold fluence for sys-\ntems where the interfacial film-substrate interaction pro-\nmotes nanoparticle production. Here, we apply the finite el-\nement model \u0004see Eqs. \u00014\u0002\u2013\u00017\u0002\u0005 in an attempt to simulate the\nmelting of thin Ni, Au, Ag, and Mo films on SiO2. We will\nthen compare the predicted threshold melting fluences, as a\nfunction of d, with those observed experimentally, which are\nshown in Fig. 7 for Ag, Au, Mo, and Ni films.\nFigure 8\u0001a\u0002 shows a simulated temperature temporal pro-\nfile for the surface layer of a 20 nm Ni thin film irradiated at\na fluence equivalent to an experimental exposure of\n330 mJ\/cm2. Four Ni layers were used for the simulation.\nThe surface temperature is seen to rise rapidly at the start of\nthe pulse, to level out as the film melts, then to increase\nagain. After the laser pulse ends the film rapidly cools to near\nroom temperature in \u0003100 ns. It is observed immediately\nthat this simulation predicts that rapid cooling through heat\nconduction into the substrate severely limits the maximum\ntemperature obtainable at a given fluence. As expected, the\ncooling rate is sufficiently high so that each laser shot can be\nTABLE I.

Figure 8\u0001b\u0002 shows a plot of the simulated\nfluence required to melt Ni, Au, and Ag films of different\nthickness. It was not possible to simulate the melting of the\nMo thin films accurately as the melting point of Mo was\nhigher than the melting point of SiO2 and the finite element\nmethod used could not contend with the large temperature\ngradients that resulted. The predicted fluences are observed\nto compare favorably with the measured values. The pre-\ndicted threshold fluences for Ni are closer to the measured\nvalues, than those of Ag and Au but the simulation appears to\noverestimate the fluence required to melt the thin Au and Ag\nfilms. In addition, the general form of the dependence of\nthreshold with thickness is close to that observed. It is sug-\ngested that the threshold discrepancy can be attributed to the\nuncertainty of the parameters used. In all cases the values are\nfor high quality bulk materials, but here it is expected that\nwe are investigating defective or amorphous nanoscale films.\nIndeed, the melting points of films with nanometric thickness\nhave been shown to be lower than that of bulk material.33\nAs we observed in this study and previously,16 the thermal\nconductivity of the substrate and the initial film thickness\nwere both critical parameters in determining the threshold\nfluence for nanostructuring Ni thin films. Using the present\nsimulation, we can investigate this directly by varying the\nthermal conductivity of the substrate and the film thickness\nand observing the change in the melting fluence and the\ncooling rate.

Nanostructuring mechanisms\nBased on the validated simulation of the melting of very\nthin metal films by pulsed laser irradiation developed in this\nstudy, we can now suggest a set of mechanisms for the ELN\nfor the production of metal nanoparticles. At the onset of\nlaser irradiation, the film temperature rapidly rises during the\npulse. The rate of temperature rise is determined by the rate\nof heat conduction out of the film. If the film gets hot enough\nto melt, and the liquid phase poorly wets the substrate,\nbreakup into droplets is likely. The question then arises: Is\nthe breakup a self-ordering phenomenon, or can some pa-\nrameter of the film account for the droplet size observed? At\nthickness inhomogeneities in the film, the fluence required\nfor melting will change. For thick films the root mean square\nsurface roughness is expected to be lower than that for the\nthinner films. However, even if the roughness remains un-\nchanged, a 1 nm fluctuation will produce a much more sig-\nnificant local change in threshold fluence for a 5 nm thick\nfilm than for one 15 nm thick. We can observe this directly if\nwe consider the derivative of the curves in Fig. 8\u0001b\u0002, which is\nlowest at the largest thickness. Thus, we expect local hot\nspots \u0001at thicker areas\u0002 to be a much rarer phenomenon for\nthick films than for thinner ones. In the regime where volume\nis conserved \u0001no ablation\u0002, the nanoparticle radius R would\nbe expected to be determined by Eq. \u00018\u0002\nVolume of droplet Vd =\n4\u000bR3\n3\n\t\nL2d\nN\n, \u00018\u0002\nwhere L is the distance between perforations, d is the film\nthickness, and N is the number of droplets into which each\nfilament breaks up. The diameter of the droplets, for a uni-\nform nanowire filament, is determined by the Rayleigh insta-\nbility criterion29 and is expected to be \u00033.78 times the radius\nof the filament r. So the number of drops will be dependent\non the film thickness. As the length of the filament will be\nproportional to L, we get\nVolume of filament Vf \t L\u000br2 \t L2d, so R \t \bLd . \u00019\u0002\nFrom the results shown in Fig. 1\u0001e\u0002 and from analysis of\nthe data from the ELN of the other metals, it can be seen\nthat, rather than R varying with \bd, R increases superlinearly\nwith d indicating that L must be increasing very rapidly with\nincreasing d. This is exactly what would be predicted if we\nare relying on thickness fluctuations to provide the perfora-\ntions. A thickness fluctuation will have to be larger \u0001i.e.,\nmore standard deviations from the mean, occurring less fre-\nquently, and being more widely spaced\u0002 for a 15 nm thick\nfilm to have the same effect when compared to a 5 nm thick\nfilm.\nOnce the film has broken up into isolated droplets, any\nsubsequent pulses will remelt the droplets \u0001or just the sur-\nfaces of the larger drops\u0002. Although the ELN has been per-\nformed in a scanning mode, with multiple laser spots on each\narea, experiments show that only a single laser shot at the\nhighest energy is required to nanostructure the films. Unless\nthe droplets are mobile on the surface no further modification\nis expected unless the fluence is high enough to boil off the\nsurface material, as is observed with the Au films at fluences\nhigher than the threshold. Careful examination of the images\nin Figs. 3\u0001b\u0002 and 3\u0001c\u0002 shows that the size of the larger drop-\nlets appears to have increased at the higher fluence. This is\nalso observed for Ag in Figs. 3\u0001f\u0002 and 3\u0001g\u0002. This is likely a\nconsequence of some of the droplets being mobile on the\nsurface, as their surface boils, allowing some of the surviving\ndrops to coalesce. This phenomenon was not observed for Ni\nand Ti thin films, where the boiling point was not reached. In\nfact by masking areas of the film and only depositing metal\nthrough the mask we can demonstrate that the droplets in\ngeneral are not mobile unless they boil. Figure 10 shows a\nSEM image of an array of patches of Ni droplets produced\nby ELN of a patterned Ni film. Lithographic and masking\ntechniques can be used in conjunction with ELN with little\nspread of the metal out of the defined areas. This will be\nimportant if ELN is to be used in conjunction with traditional\ndevice fabrication techniques. At extremely high laser flu-\nences we enter the ablation regime, where the thin film melts\nand splits into droplets, which can then boil. However, as\nthey boil these droplets appear to fragment into smaller\nnanoparticles \u0001\u000410 nm in diameter\u0002, which can be left on the\nsubstrate\nWe should also consider the temperature rise of the sub-\nstrate during the process. For a 4 cm2 Si substrate, 1 mm\nthick, irradiated by one laser pulse at 500 mJ the expected\nfinal temperature rise is calculated as \u00030.15 K, ignoring heat\nconduction into the surroundings. Thus, unless a very large\nnumber of shots per unit length is used during the scan, the\nsubstrate should remain at a low macroscopic temperature. In\ncomparison, the production of Ni nanoislands by thermal an-\nnealing of thin Ni films, for example, typically requires the\nwhole substrate to be raised to high temperatures \u0001\u0003800\u2013\n900 K\u0002 for extended periods of time. The ELN technique\nalso differs from thermal annealing as the islands are formed\nby bulk instabilities in a molten thin film, rather than by a\nprocess analogous to Ostwald ripening where mass transport\nFIG. 10.

ELN offers a method\nfor fabricating nanostructured metal-on-oxide substrates,\nrapidly, over a large area and at low macroscopic tempera-\ntures.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThe underlying physical mechanisms of the ELN tech-\nnique were investigated, for a carefully chosen selection of\nmetals with differing physical and thermodynamic proper-\nties, and differing propensities for oxide formation. A finite\nelement model was introduced that can be used to model the\nmelting of very thin metal-on-oxide films by pulsed lasers.\nUsing the results from ELN experiments and simulations us-\ning this model, the thermal conductivity of the substrate was\nshown to be a controlling parameter on the laser fluence\nrequired to melt very thin films. Once molten, it is suggested\nthat the breakup of the film into nanodroplets only occurs\nwhen the liquid metal does not wet the substrate, the heat of\nformation of the metal oxide being a critical parameter. The\neffect of film thickness fluctuations on the local threshold for\nmelting is then suggested as the main influence on the nano-\nparticle size. ELN is expected to be suitable for producing\nnanoparticles of a large range of different materials, where\npoor wetting of substrate by the liquid phase is observed.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank the EPSRC Portfolio\nGrant and the Carbon Based Electronics Programme for\nfunding the project.\n*Electronic address: s.henley@eim.surrey.ac.uk\n1 G.
