Drawing on a series of group interviews conducted with taxi-\ndrivers in Britain, Germany and the Czech Republic, it looks at how political problems are articulated \nin discussion, how speakers position themselves in relation to these problems, and how this differs \naccording to the topics in question.  It is suggested that these routinised discursive practices shape the \nway speakers make sense of the political world, and in turn the kinds of political association that make \nsense to them as citizens. \n \n \nThere seems to be some consensus that in today\u2019s global political configuration one can no longer \nassume the congruence of social identities, social practices and political boundaries.\n2\n  This \nobservation is particularly familiar in connection to contemporary Europe, where the transnational \nintegration of socio-economic and administrative processes has advanced to a peculiar degree, and \nwhere the viability of the European Union as a democratic polity has been widely held to rest on \nthe emergence of some form of transnational identity.  Popular modes of identification have \nbecome a topic of notable interest amongst political theorists and sociologists of contemporary \nEurope.  \n Commonly, these forms of identification are conceptualised in terms of people\u2019s feelings of \nsocio-cultural belonging, their willingness to extend trust and solidarity, their sense of shared \nvalues, or simply their attitudes towards \u2018Europe\u2019 and the EU.3  Much empirical research treats \nsuch phenomena as a feature of individual consciousness, and accordingly polls individuals on their \nfeelings of belonging and \u2018identity\u2019, their values, their inclination to trust, and so on.  The evident \ndanger here is that one forces opinions to be expressed on highly abstract matters which \nrespondents have rarely engaged with, and infers attitudes and beliefs which have barely formed.  \nPerhaps a more productive way to study forms of popular identification is simply to get people \ntalking about the issues of importance to them and examine the reference-points they evoke \nspontaneously.\n4\n  The common-sense assumptions embedded in casual discussion on matters of \npolitical relevance may tell us far more about people\u2019s interpretations of the world under conditions \nof globalisation, and the implications of these for integration projects such as the EU, than answers \nto direct questioning intended to tap their conscious thoughts. \n This piece outlines some findings from an exploratory research project into patterns of \neveryday speech as found in group discussions with taxi-drivers in Britain, Germany and the Czech \nRepublic.  It first set outs the research method, describing the means by which a rich body of \nempirical material can be elicited.  It then looks at how the political world is ordered in discussion, \nidentifying a number of thematic domains in which speakers tend to cluster the problems they \narticulate.  It goes on to examine how speakers take up positions in relation to the problems they \ndiscuss, and notes in particular how patterns of collective positioning vary according to the matter \nat hand.  Different sets of problems inspire different formulations for \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019, and some \n 2 \nencourage the evocation of a transnational context \u2013 though not distinctly European \u2013 while others \nare treated as more local.   \n This close analysis of everyday discursive practices indicates how one can study popular \nidentification without reliance on the usual cognitive models.  Taking political discussion as the \nfocus means abandoning the quest to find \u2018identity\u2019 in the supposed mental attributes of individuals \nand looking instead at that which is collectively and observably taken for granted.  There is no \ndefinitive description to be given of the mental phenomena which give rise to the articulation of \nopinions, since these are underdetermined by the opinions themselves; but putting mental \nphenomena to one side, one can still investigate the patterns of assumption and collective \npositioning which can be identified in discursive interaction.\n5\n  These routinised discursive practices \nare deep features of the text: even where there is disagreement in opinion, it tends to be enabled by \ntacit agreement in assumptions.  While individuals retain a certain degree of creativity, allowing \nsuch practices to evolve over time, nonetheless they must draw heavily on the patterned ways of \nspeaking which are available to them. \n \n \nGroup Discussions with Taxi-Drivers. \n \nGroup discussions have the principal advantage that they involve participants interacting with each \nother as well as the researcher.\n6\n  This reduces the danger that the researcher unwittingly \npredetermines the outcome of the study through his\/her own interventions.  For these discussions, \ntaxi-drivers were chosen on the supposition that their conversation may exhibit in concentrated \nform the kinds of discursive practice common amongst lay people, i.e. those without a professional \ninterest in politics.  Taxi-driving puts one in a position of heightened sensitivity to a wide range of \npolitical developments, including changes in prices or spending behaviour, the arrival of immigrant \nlabour, increases in criminal behaviour, or new policing tactics.  At the same time drivers are \nexposed to diverse opinion stimuli (in particular the media, and the experiences of others as \nnarrated to them on the job), mitigating the possibility that theirs is a speech community isolated \nfrom the rest of society.  The self-understanding of many taxi-drivers is arguably as people of \ncommon sense and practical wisdom; unlike, for example, students, academics or artists, they show \nlittle tendency to emphasise their personal originality by formulating opinions deliberately in \ncontrast to those they hear around them.\n7\n  Also, more practically, they are not un-used to being \noffered money for their time.   \n A total of ten interviews were conducted at locations across Europe between October 2004 \nand August 2005, with the goal of gathering from widespread locations a body of comparable \nmaterial which can be explored for commonalities and variations.  The choice of countries \ncorresponded to the so-called logic of diversity: a large country on the periphery of Europe and \ntraditionally a \u2018reluctant\u2019 participant in European integration, a large continental country at the \nheart of the integration process from the beginning, and a smaller, post-communist country which \nhas undergone rapid political change and only recent accession to the Union.  Cities were chosen \nfor continuity of size (150,000 to 300,000 inhabitants) but geographical spread and diversity of \nhistorical experience: three in Britain (Reading, Swansea and Norwich); three in the Czech \nRepublic (Plze\u0148, Liberec and Ostrava), and four in Germany (including one city in the former East \n\u2013 Erfurt \u2013 and three in the former West \u2013 L\u00fcbeck, Kassel and W\u00fcrzburg).  With a number of these \nlocations near national borders, one may also examine the (non-)prevalence of nation-based \ncategories in the discourse of those plausibly most prone to adopting them.  Taxi-driving in these \ncities tends to be a full-time and permanent occupation, and to be populated by long-term residents \n\u2013 even if first- or second-generation immigrants \u2013 rather than recent arrivals.  As a heuristic \nclassification, these drivers can be taken to occupy the socio-economic space which extends from \nthe working- to the lower-middle class.\n8\n   \n 3 \n Groups of three to four were assembled in caf\u00e9s and pubs for discussions of up to two hours.\n9\n  \nParticipants were recruited directly at the largest taxi-rank in each city, at times of low customer \ndemand and with the aid of financial incentives.\n10\n  An effort was made to recruit those who were \nalready engaged in conversation, on the grounds that \u2018political talk\u2019 may be a more natural \nphenomenon amongst acquaintances, and while not all participants knew each other in advance, at \nleast some were familiar with everyone.\n11\n  Many of the discussions featured cross-references to \nconversations held on prior occasions, implying the interviews were enmeshed in a broader history \nof discussion.  A concern for some degree of \u2018naturalness\u2019 to the discussion meant that the criteria \nused to guide sampling were quite simple.  A balance of ages was sought for each group, with the \nyoungest driver being in his 20s or 30s and the oldest in his 50s or 60s.  Where ethnic minorities \nwere strongly represented on the taxi-rank (as at Reading), it was made certain that the sample \nreflected this.\n12\n  Female drivers were very rare in the ten cities studied, and while no specific \nattempt was made to exclude them from the sample, in practice they did not feature.   \n The interviews were quite loosely structured.  Approximately the first twenty minutes were \ndevoted to a card exercise, designed to provoke a discussion in which one could study the salience \nof different problems, how they were assumed to \u2018go together\u2019, and the concepts used to link them.  \nSeventeen thematic index-cards were used, each consisting of two images and a verbal heading, \nand each referring to a topic with some connection to public life: Peace & War, Treatment of \nOutsiders, Overseas Aid, Medical Care, Education & Training, The Legal System, Policing, Health \n& Safety Standards, The Environment, Science & Research, Transport, Money & Prices, Purchase \nof Property, Markets & Production, Taxation, Corruption, and Work.\n13\n   \n These headings were the author\u2019s own creations, intended to combine breadth of coverage \nwith openness to interpretation.  It was expected that the cards would be of unequal interest to the \nparticipants: the intention was to provide a starting-point from which they could proceed as they \nchose.  Participants were invited to arrange the cards in piles according to \u2018what goes naturally with \nwhat\u2019, justifying their choices as they did so, and to add to the seventeen cards any which they felt \nwere missing.  With this type of researh it is the accompanying discussion (i.e. the discursive \npractice) which becomes the focus of analysis, not the arrangement of cards as such.  As a second \nstep, the participants were asked, for each of the piles of cards they had created, to decide on a \nsummary title.  The third step, which then constituted the bulk of the discussion, consisted in \nparticipants selecting problem-areas to talk about in detail according to those they considered the \nmost urgent and important.  For much of this open section of the interview, the role of the \nresearcher was restricted to occasional interventions to ask patterned questions such as \u2018who is to \nblame for such problems?\u2019, and \u2018who is affected by them?\u2019 \n \n \nOrdering the Political World in Discussion \n \nThe forms of collective identification evoked in discussion depend much upon the problems in \nquestion, and for this reason it is sensible to look first at the patterned ways in which problems are \ndivided up and ordered in discussion.  In keeping with the decision to use group interviews, the \nfocus is not so much on the interventions of individuals but on the repertoires of interpretation \nwhich they share and which guide their interaction.  It may be useful here to recall how, in the \nWittgensteinian tradition, rule-based behaviour is understood as the enactment of knowledge about \n\u2018how to carry on\u2019.14  This knowledge or \u2018competence\u2019 is understood as a social phenomenon, as a \nbasic convergence in practices and the capacity for successful coordination and adjustment among \npeers.  Competence in conversation, by extension, can be seen as the ability of individuals mutually \nto coordinate their talk based on a certain convergence in discursive practices: to make \ninterventions which others can respond to, and to carry on from what others say, so as to achieve \nsome level of ordered and sustained interaction. \n 4 \n By convening participants in an interview environment, supplying them with prompt cards, \nand asking them to justify the choices they make with these cards, I was creating a situation in \nwhich participants must \u2018carry on\u2019.  The cards, rather than pre-determining the discussion, act as a \nset of tools that can be employed in different ways: some are likely to be neglected, while others \nare likely to be followed up and become the basis for a detailed conversation.  Only if the \nparticipants are sufficiently competent to handle at least some such resources, and to \u2018carry on\u2019 by \nreaching beyond the situation to knowledge which is already available to them, can an ordered \ndiscussion emerge.  Importantly, the fact that participants are in a group environment means that all \ninterventions are subject to the judgement of peers.  This acts to filter out interventions which are \ntrivial or highly idiosyncratic, since participants are likely to say things which they assume others \nin the group will be able to react to and develop.  As H.P. Grice famously noted, there is a \ncooperational basis to conversation.\n15\n  Even autobiographical narratives must, in the group context, \nbe presented in such a way that they hold common significance, and interventions which diverge \nfrom this rule are likely either to be rejected explicitly as odd, or to result in a breakdown in \nconversation and a shift in topic.  When certain problems are repeatedly linked together in \ndiscussion, and when participants accept and develop the linkages which are made by others, one \ncan treat this as indicative therefore of a more basic convergence in discursive practice concerning \nwhat topics go with what.  The analyst\u2019s ability to identify these patterns of ordering, within and \nacross groups, depends significantly upon their own practical competence as an interpreting actor, \nsomething which cannot be distilled to a set of theoretical rules.  Nonetheless, useful indicators \ninclude the justifications that are made for the card arrangements, and cross-referrals in the \ndiscussion to that which was said earlier.  The transpersonal dimension becomes evident when \nproblems are talked about and developed by more than one participant, arguments are constructed \njointly, and when the same problems are pursued in depth in more than one interview.  Levels of \nsalience may be indicated by emotive language, such as more than one participant expressing a \nsense of injustice or frustration, or by the early expression of opinion.   \n A brief look at how the interview at L\u00fcbeck developed should serve to clarify this approach.  \nHaving explained the protocol for the discussion, the participants were invited to consider how best \nto order the prompt-cards laid out on the table:  \n \nJW:  Perhaps you could spend a couple of minutes thinking about how these cards might go together.  If you had \nto make little groups out of them, how would you do so?  There\u2019s no right or wrong way, whatever seems \nnatural.   \n \nJochen:  How many groups should it be? \n \nJW:  Up to you, up to you.  [90 second pause] \n \nJochen:  So, what would I say \u2026 start with the economy, with Taxes \u2026 they belong together, right? \u2026 Markets \nand Production are directly linked with Taxes because taxes can strengthen or weaken the economy.  \n[Werner: yeah]  And \u2026 Science and Research \u2026 also has something to do with the economy, because \ninnovation strengthens the power of the economy.   \n \nWerner:  Yeah, I\u2019d also put those together.  And Work too \u2026 [J:  Work too]  \u2026 Work too \u2026 [J:  Work too.] \n \nFrom the outset, the vocabulary on the cards is being handled non-arbitrarily: Jochen creates a \nsmall narrative to explain the relationship between them, one which is validated by Werner\u2019s \ninterventions, in turn accepted by Jochen.  When asked to summarise the collection of cards with a \ntitle, the participants chose \u2018Occupation and the Economy\u2019 (having considered \u2018Markets and the \nEconomy\u2019 and \u2018Working Life\u2019), giving an indication of the links assumed.  Of further interest is \nwhat happened a few minutes later: the card \u2018Money and Prices\u2019 had for some reason ended up in a \ndifferent pile, but questions started to be raised as to why.  Jochen said it should have been placed \n 5 \nwith \u2018Occupation and the Economy\u2019; Niklas, Hamid and Werner agreed, and it was moved over.  \nArguments appealing to common expectations of what goes with what were able where necessary \nto overturn whatever momentum was generated in the placing of cards. \n When asked to go into further depth, Jochen invoked once more \u2018the economy\u2019 and, with the \nactive support of Werner and Niklas, used it to link together a whole series of concepts which had \nnot been written on any of the cards: \u2018I think the biggest problem here in Germany at the moment is \nthe economy.  [Werner: yeah]  The economy, and work of course.  Unemployment and \u2026 zero \neconomic growth, or hardly any economic growth, and the unemployment which goes with that.  \nDomestic purchasing power, the lack of domestic purchasing power.  Also under this heading with \nmoney and prices I\u2019d say the introduction of the euro is very relevant, because the euro \u2013 due to the \nexchange rate \u2013 has brought disadvantages in purchasing power, considerable \u2026 [Niklas: price \nrises] \u2026 Yeah, it\u2019s led to price rises, and so also the purchasing power, the domestic demand, has \ngone down, because people have less money at their disposal.\u2019  A later cross-reference (this time by \nWerner) suggests the naturalness with which the participants orientate themselves in discussion \nusing the concept of \u2018the economy\u2019.  The conversation had been looking at the problem of \ninadequate contributions to the health-insurance system: \u2018The easiest solution for this problem \nwould be full employment.  If there weren\u2019t five million unemployed people there, if they were \npaying into the pension and health insurance, then we wouldn\u2019t have all these problems \u2026 [Niklas: \nyeah].  We\u2019re back to this first subject again \u2013 the economy.  It all links together.\u2019  Some notion of \n\u2018the economy\u2019 or \u2018economics\u2019 clearly comes across as an organising concept, a way of linking \ntogether specific problems which are recognisable to several or all of the participants. \n Across the groups in this study, one finds participants constructing a domain of problems to \ndo with economics, tying together issues such as wages, prices, unemployment, taxation, \ninequality, social security and insurance, the consequences of privatisation, state finances, the \ndecline of industry and exports, and the adequacy of the education system in equipping people for \nemployment.  Not all groups, of course, when asked to label the card piles formed at the beginning \nof the interview used the word \u2018economics\u2019 or its functional equivalents in the relevant language.  \nA range of candidate titles was generated, perhaps all with a family resemblance, but with enough \nvariety to suggest a plurality of ways of constructing the domain.   \n One does not need to locate domains in the individual brain;\n16\n they can be understood as \npatterns at the level of the text, produced in coordinated action.  Using the same techniques, two \nfurther domains were identified.  One can be called Relations between Peoples, and spans the \nadministrative and analytical distinction \u2013 rarely found in these discussions \u2013 between foreign \npolicy and domestic intergroup relations.  Key problems articulated included intergroup conflict \nand perceived threat (internationally, and domestically at the street level), and the unwanted \nencounter with cultural otherness.  Wars and terrorism were discussed with some regularity here \n(somewhat less so amongst the Czech groups).  A third domain concerns the breaking of legal and \nsocial rules and can be referred to as Society and the Law: problem-areas identified include crime, \ncorruption, policing, justice, the behaviour of individuals towards others in society, and the \neducation system (understood here in terms of its capacity to produce law-abiding citizens).  While \nthe categories \u2018relations between peoples\u2019 and \u2018society and the law\u2019 do not recur in the discussions \nwith the frequency of \u2018economics\u2019, nonetheless the problems associated with them were linked up \nrepeatedly, both in the discussion surrounding the card-exercise and in the subsequent open \nphase.\n17\n  That the interviews were not being \u2018fixed in advance\u2019 by the prompt-cards seems to be \nconfirmed by the fact that a number of topics indicated on the prompts, even if touched upon during \nthe exercise, were little followed up in the open discussions.  Almost nothing, for example, was \nsaid in the open discussions that could be linked closely to \u2018Science and Research\u2019, and, in contrast \nto a card such as \u2018Money and Prices\u2019, it was never referred to, pointed at, or tapped during \ndiscussion.   \n 6 \n The problems associated with Economics, Society and the Law and Relations between \nPeoples undoubtedly do not exhaust the ways in which the political world might be ordered in \ndiscussion: there are problems which were articulated only sporadically in these discussions, such \nas environmental pollution, and aspects of life which were not discussed at all, such as gender \nrelations, which amongst different social groups or in different spatio-temporal contexts might be \nproblematised in depth.  But these three domains represent a core of problems which were \narticulated and developed throughout the interviews.  They were discussed as common problems, \nliable to affect \u2018people like us\u2019.  This does not mean that all participants necessarily linked \nthemselves to them as individuals: as taxi-drivers, none of the participants was unemployed or in \nimmediate danger of unemployment, and certainly not by the factory closures which were so often \nmentioned.  It was not a problem liable to affect \u2018me\u2019, but it was nonetheless a problem that could \naffect \u2018people like us\u2019; a reference-point in relation to which collective, we-oriented subjection-\npositions were generated in discussion.   \n \n \nPatterns of Collective Positioning \n \nSo as to define their relationship with the problems discussed, speakers evoke a considerable range \nof social groupings.  These groupings do not constitute \u2018the identity\u2019 of the participants, since \nspeakers invoke different subject-positions at different moments in discussion as they move from \none set of problems to another, but they are categories and implicit groupings towards which the \nparticipants orient themselves.  Importantly, \u2018we\u2019-definition and description is generally a relational \nmove, an act of positioning which requires the evocation of \u2018others\u2019 so as to clarify and give \nmeaning to the \u2018we\u2019.  For each domain of problems, one can explore who is positioned as the \n\u2018people like us\u2019 (or \u2018subjects\u2019) affected in like fashion by these problems, who are positioned as \ntheir opponents, and how these opponents are described.  One can also look at how comparisons are \nmade, and the types of location assumed to be similar.  Different patterns of positioning emerge in \nthe three principal domains that have been highlighted; a passage from the W\u00fcrzburg discussion \ncontributes to our reading of Relations between Peoples:  \n  \nUlrich:  I recently read again how the British are supposed to have trashed the Germans [in newspapers like \nThe Sun and The Daily Mirror].  I said to myself, well, you know, I\u2019m not going to get caught up in this \nhysteria.  I\u2019ve met enough British people and I\u2019ve always got on really well with British people and I \nthink it\u2019s all rubbish.  Racism or whatever, it\u2019s basically stupidity I think \u2026 [Ralf: yeah].  Because \u2026 \nthink about it, what is the difference between a British person and me?  Basically there\u2019s none at all.  He \nwas born over there and I was born here. \n \nOskar:  They\u2019re partly blood-related, through the Angles and Saxons \u2026 they also had German origins.  [\u2026]  \nAs far as what he\u2019s saying, with the Germans and British, I don\u2019t see that as a problem at all.  The only \nthing which I see as a problem in Germany is the religion issue, Muslims and Christians \u2026 [U: yeah].  \nThat\u2019s the only, fundamental problem, that Muslims are anchored here in the society, and on the one hand \nthe women behave and dress like German women and on the other hand there\u2019s the danger of attacks.  \nMuslim fundamentalism \u2026 [R: yeah, yeah].  And anyone, if he wants to, can commit a suicide attack \nhere.  You can\u2019t even expel them any more, because a lot of them are already German citizens.   \n \nUlrich:  [to JW]  You have that problem as well, especially in London.  The same problem.   \n \nOskar:  ... In the whole of Europe \u2026 the Netherlands \u2026  \n \nRalf:  Yeah, exactly \u2026 they\u2019re getting the same in Britain too, that\u2019s right \u2026 [U:  ... The same problem ...] \n \nOskar:  ... Britain ... London ... Very difficult.  A lot of Muslims there too \u2026 \n \n 7 \nUlrich:  ... And they\u2019re also perverse.   And the problem is, OK I\u2019m generalising a bit, if you have a hundred \nMuslims, one makes an attack, but the other 99, who know about it, they don\u2019t speak up.  They\u2019re \nharmless, sure, but they wouldn\u2019t say anything even if they knew, I think.  That is the danger [R:  Yeah, I \nagree \u2026] For everyone, for the whole western world, whether it\u2019s Germany or Britain or the US.  I really \nsee that as a problem.   \n \nRalf:  It must be very pronounced in France too, I think the problem there is even greater.  In France, because \nof the close connection with Arab countries \u2026 Algeria \u2026 Morocco \u2026   \n \nThe problem is formulated here as the presence of conflict and otherness in the local environment.  \nAs places where people encounter this, Germany is highlighted, and comparisons are made with \nvarious parts of Europe and also the US.  The people affected are constructed as \u2018Christians\u2019 and \nmore generally those of \u2018the western world\u2019; a little later in the discussion they are described as \u2018the \nwhite race\u2019, and the mention of a blood relation between Germans and British is highlighted here.  \nThe differences between them are downplayed; they are not identical (a comparison is necessary), \nbut they are assumed to be counterparts in this context.  This is typical of the material as a whole: \nwhen Relations-between-Peoples problems are articulated, whether in domestic or international \nterms, those positioned as \u2018we\u2019 correspond to something like \u2018the West\u2019, where this may carry \nracial connotations (the white majority), and often carries connotations of good sense and \npeacefulness.   \n Relations between these peoples of the West are widely assumed to be smooth: as Ralf says \nelsewhere, \u2018conditions like those that led to the First World War, to the Second World War, or also \neven in the century before, where there were hostilities within central Europe that led to the world \nwars: they\u2019ve been completely eliminated, gone forever, or at least for a long time.\u2019  The need to \nmaintain peaceful relations between European peoples \u2013 one of the historical justifications of the \nEU \u2013 goes unmentioned, since these peoples (and those in the wider West) are taken to be peaceful \nanyway.  Instead, as evident in the passage above, the \u2018we\u2019 tends to be demarcated in particular \nagainst Arabs or Muslims, who are assumed to be present not just beyond the borders of the West \nbut close to home in the city itself.  These opponents are portrayed as uncompromising and \naggressive (with the religious dimension often emphasised), and they are cast not so much as \nadversaries who are to be convinced, defeated or tolerated, but as enemies who may need to be \nexcluded from the community.\n18\n  Where explanations are given for these problems of conflict, they \ntend to include reference-points global in scope, including the supposed characteristics of peoples \nfrom different parts of the world, and global contests between them and the West over power and \nresources. \n In the discussion of Economics-related problems, those positioned as \u2018people like us\u2019 are \ndifferent, and the range of comparisons slightly narrower.  National categories are rare: certainly no \nspeakers talked of economic problems which faced \u2018us Europeans\u2019, but nor were there many \neconomic problems described as affecting \u2018British\u2019, \u2018Germans\u2019 or \u2018Czechs\u2019 in broad, \nundifferentiated terms.  As subjects one hears instead much talk of \u2018working men\u2019, \u2018those who \ncontribute their share\u2019, \u2018the little people\u2019, \u2018ordinary\u2019 or \u2018normal people\u2019 or (particularly from the \nBritish) \u2018those in the middle\u2019.  As locations where others are liable to be affected by price \nincreases, taxation and lost jobs, one finds comparisons made spontaneously with neighbouring \ncountries in Europe of a similar level of economic development.  Amongst the British and German \ngroups this means western Europe, while amongst the Czech groups it means countries of central \nand eastern Europe such as Poland, Slovakia and Hungary.  Bar a few exceptional topics connected \nto international finance, these places are described not as unitary actors but as environments where \nevents unfold, and where counterparts face similar difficulties to \u2018us\u2019.  But unlike for Relations \nbetween Peoples, hardly any comparisons are made with the US or Australia.  The formulation of \nthe opponents is also quite different: instead of against \u2018Muslims\u2019, one sees the subjects demarcated \nagainst opponents such as \u2018the rich\u2019, \u2018shareholders\u2019 and \u2018multi-national concerns\u2019, and to some \ndegree (especially amongst the British) those who avoid paying their taxes.  Such opponents tend to \n 8 \nbe portrayed more as a cost than an existential threat: disliked, but their presence grudgingly \naccepted.  Where explanatory factors are offered, they tend to cite causes which extend \nconsiderably beyond Europe and beyond the reach of a European polity: local problems such as \nunemployment in the city, price rises or the decline of local industry tended to be attributed to \nfactors such as global inequalities in prices and wages.   \n While a transnational context is evoked very freely in Economics and Relations between \nPeoples (albeit generally not \u2018European\u2019 as such), in discussion of problems to do with Society and \nthe Law a transnational context is rarely mentioned.  The focus is firmly on \u2018the city\u2019, with \noccasional comparisons with other cities in the same country, or across time, but very little \nreference to conditions outside.  As subject positions one finds \u2018those who play by the rules\u2019 (and \nare potential victims) and \u2018those who speak up for the rules\u2019.  The opponents in this domain are the \nhardened criminals, the egotistical and the corrupt; some minority groups are mentioned as \npersistent rule-breakers, but there is almost no reference to transnational, organised criminal \nnetworks.  The focus is on the behaviour and mentalities of local actors, and explanations are local \nin their reach.  References to the EU are naturally quite absent. \n   \n \nDiscussion \n \nTracing these everyday discursive practices indicates some important things about popular \nidentification under contemporary conditions.  Firstly, it reminds that one need not look to abstract \n\u2018feelings of belonging\u2019 or \u2018identity\u2019 as the basis for collective positioning, still less seek to research \nthese through questionnaires that challenge the respondent to declare his\/her \u2018feelings of \nEuropeanness\u2019 and suchlike.  Political issues themselves form the basis of a rich set of resources for \nwe-formation, and while it may be that not all such identification is normatively desirable \u2013 \ntolerance of opponents can be quite thin \u2013 there seems little reason to suppose that citizens are too \npolitically apathetic or unaware to engage in it.  A greater focus on how people interpret the world \nof politics and political problems would therefore seem an appropriate way of expanding research \nin European Studies beyond the usual culture- and values-based approaches.  This seems \nparticularly important given that, secondly, forms of identification vary according to the problems \nin question.  Rather than thinking of hierarchies or concentric circles of identities, as many \nschemes in the EU-related literature suggest, domain-specificity may be a more useful orienting \nidea.  Moreover, the transnational element seems to vary by domain.  One sees little over-arching \nunity here, either centred on the national or the European level: reference-points range from the \nbroader-than-European to the quite local.   \nThirdly, the frequent use of transnational comparisons for certain sets of problems, and the \nevocation of others abroad who share in the same problems as \u2018us\u2019, suggests political theorists \nmight want to conceptualise further the idea of the \u2018counterpart\u2019, the stranger living outside \u2018our\u2019 \nenvironment who nonetheless shares in our problems.  This would seem to be an interesting figure \nto think about when conceptualising an EU demos.  Likewise, there seems something theoretically \nsignificant about the textual distinction one encounters between references to other countries as \nunitary and perhaps competitive actors (\u2018France\u2019 in the sense of \u2018the French\u2019, for example), and \nreferences to other countries as environments in which events unfold, as locations worthy of \ncomparison because they feature others whose predicament is similar to \u2018ours\u2019.  In these interviews \nthe latter were common, especially as regards locations in Europe \u2013 though there is no neat fit to \nthe contours of the EU.   \nFor such patterns to support a political community coextensive with the EU, the tendency \ntowards transnational comparisons would probably need to be extended so as to include countries \nboth in western and eastern Europe, and the subject-position of \u2018the West\u2019, including its racial and \nantagonistic undertones, undermined.  Furthermore, these acts of positioning would arguably need \n 9 \nto be coupled with references to the EU as an arena for tackling the problems in question.  One \nwould want to see the assumption that it is feasible to address such problems as part of a collective \npolitical project, coupled with the sense that at least some of them can and should be addressed on a \ncoordinated European scale.  While these issues are beyond the scope of this essay, they may \nreadily be studied using the same research method, as part of a wider inquiry into patterns of \neveryday discursive practice on matters of political relevance. \n \n \n                                                 \n1\n Special thanks to Volker Balli, Harry Bauer, Mich\u00e8le Lamont, Christine Reh, Michael Vo\u0159\u00ed\u0161ek, Peter Wagner, Albert \nWeale and Lea Ypi, as well as the Journal\u2019s referees. \n2\n Peter Wagner, 'Crises of Modernity: Political Sociology in Historical Contexts', in Stephen Turner (ed.), Social \nTheory and Sociology: The Classics and Beyond (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996). \n3\n For a review of theoretical contributions to the EU debate, see Peter Wagner and Heidrun Friese, 'Survey Article: The \nNascent Political Philosophy of the European Polity', Journal of Political Philosophy, 10\/3 (2002).

Theodore R. Schatzki, Karin \nKnorr Cetina, and Eike Von Savigny, The Practice Turn in Contemporary Theory (London: Routledge, 2001);  Stephen \nTurner, The Social Theory of Practices: Tradition, Knowledge and Presuppositions (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1994).  \nFor an understanding of \u2018positioning\u2019 I draw on the discourse-theoretical work of Rom Harr\u00e9 (Harr\u00e9 and Luk Van \nLangenhove (eds.), Positioning Theory (Oxford: Blackwell, 1999)) and Chantal Mouffe\u2019s application of the concept \n\u2018subject-position\u2019 (Mouffe, The Return of the Political (London: Verso, 1993), p.97). \n6\n On the group-interview method, see William Gamson, Talking Politics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, \n1992); David L.

Calculation of earnings is problematic for two reasons however.  First, much \ndepends on the times and the number of hours the individual chooses to work.  Second, many drivers are wary of \nanyone who might turn out to be a tax-inspector, and therefore reluctant to declare their income.  Data compiled by \nnational statistics offices should therefore be treated with scepticism.  A better approximation can be had by browsing \nthe internet chatrooms which taxi-drivers themselves use to compare earnings with one another \u2013 see e.g. www.taxi-\ndriver.co.uk or www.taxiforen.de\/forum.  These indicate earnings after running costs (fuel, licensing, maintenance, car \nrental etc.), and before tax, of around \u20ac25,000 in Britain, \u20ac20,000 euros in Germany (though lower in the east), and \n\u20ac6000 in the Czech Republic, each of which falls short of Gross National Income per capita as cited in the World \nBank\u2019s World Development Indicators 2006 database.  Drivers working night hours in capital cities (who do not feature \nin this study) may nonetheless earn higher figures.   \n9\n Each discussion was led by the author in the local language, and recorded using audio microphone.  Participants were \nencouraged to select the venue. \n10\n In Britain and Germany the rates were \u20ac60-70 per head; in the Czech Republic c. \u20ac40.  These were above waiting-\ntime, and intended to represent a good return on two hours\u2019 work for most drivers: however, they were not so high that \na driver might not, in principle, have made the same amount in that time from fare-paying customers. \n11\n Cf. Pamela Conover, Donald D. Searing, and Ivor Crewe, 'The Deliberative Potential of Discussion', British Journal \nof Political Science, 32\/1 (2002).  Some studies based on participant observation in the US have emphasised the \ntendency of non-elites actively to avoid discussion of politics: see in particular Nina Eliasoph, Avoiding Politics: How \nAmericans Produce Apathy in Everyday Life (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998).  Others conversely argue \nthat such discussion is by no means uncommon: see Katherine Cramer Walsh, Talking About Politics: Informal Groups \nand Social Identity in American Life (London: University of Chicago Press, 2004).  The focus here is on what happens \nwhen the opportunity is provided, with the provision of opportunities treated as an important but separate issue. \n12\n For further details on participants, see the author\u2019s webpage: http:\/\/jonathanpjwhite.googlepages.com\/home. \n13\n The cards are reproduced on the author\u2019s webpage: http:\/\/jonathanpjwhite.googlepages.com\/home.  The exercise \ndraws on Anthony Coxon, Sorting Data: Collection and Analysis (London: SAGE, 1999). \n14\n Amongst the interpreters of Wittgenstein this approach draws particularly on Barry Barnes, 'Practice as Collective \nAction', in Schatzki, Knorr Cetina, and Von Savigny (eds.), The Practice Turn in Contemporary Theory, and Schatzki, \n 10 \n                                                                                                                                            \nSocial Practices: A Wittgensteinian Approach to Human Activity and the Social (Cambridge: Cambridge University \nPress, 1996), Chapter 2, pp.49ff. \n15\n On the \u2018cooperative principle\u2019 see H. Paul Grice, 'Logic and Conversation', in Peter Cole and Jerry L. Morgan (eds.), \nSyntax and Semantics, Vol. 3, Speech Acts (New York: Academic Press, 1975), pp.45-7. \n16\n Political psychologists have debated whether individuals carry \u2018schemas\u2019 of the political world, and of what \n\u2018domains\u2019 these might be composed (cf. Susan T. Fiske and Shelley E. Taylor, Social Cognition (Reading Mass.: \nAddison-Wesley, 1984); Pamela Johnston Conover and Stanley Feldman, 'How People Organize the Political World: A \nSchematic Model', American Review of Political Science, 28\/1 (1984)).  The suggestion in Johnston Conover and \nFeldman is that there may be four basic domains of stimuli about which people have political beliefs \u2013 economic \nmatters, social concerns, foreign affairs and racial affairs (with a suggested linkage between the last two).  This has a \nclear affinity with findings here, differences in time and location notwithstanding. \n17\n Other studies, while not investigating the clustering of problems, identify a similar set of concerns amongst \ncontemporary Europeans: e.g. Optem, 'The European Citizens and the Future of Europe: A Qualitative Study in the 25 \nMember States', (Eurobarometer, 2006). \n18\n Cf. the distinction made by Mouffe, (1993), The Return of the Political (London: Verso). \n"}
