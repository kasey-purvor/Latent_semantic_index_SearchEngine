Introduction \n \nArthropod cuticle is a composite material made of chitin fibres in a matrix of crosslinked protein \nand other components. Stimuli caused by locomotion, posture and external events induce \nmechanical strains in the cuticle which have a rich variety of sensory information. This \ninformation is picked up by sensilla formed in the cuticle. Examples are the campaniform sensilla \nof insects and the slit sense organs of arachnids. We have investigated a sensillum modelled as a \nhole, round or oval, in a plate. The biological interest is in the integration of the sensilla with \neach other and the behaviour of the organism; the information technologist is interested in \nmethods of encoding and transferring information; the engineer wants to design new sensing \nsystems, possibly leading to novel embedded sensors which can be used for smart materials. \nPhysical models have commonly been used to explain and investigate the actions and \nmechanisms of the strain sensillum. For instance, Pringle (1938) constructed a model from a \nrubber sheet and a strip of paper to explain the mode of action of the sensillum. Slit sense organs \nin spiders were modelled in Plexiglas (Barth & Pickelmann 1975). However, owing to the \ncomplexity of sensillum it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to make a physical model to \nrepresent its geometry as well as its constituent materials. As a result, simplifying assumptions \nhave to be made in the geometry and the constituent materials of the physical model. We have \nused finite-element analysis to investigate the deformation of the hole which forms the sensing \nelement of the sensillum, and the output of the coupling mechanism which is found in nature. \nA hole is commonly regarded as weakening a load-bearing structure, since it can initiate failure. \nHowever, the deformation of a hole before failure can yield useful information about the loads \nimposed. The stress concentration effects of openings of various geometry in anisotropic \nmaterials have been investigated theoretically and experimentally mainly in relation to situations \nwhere the fibres terminate at the edge of the holes (Lekhnitskii 1968). A circular hole drilled in a \nsheet of unidirectional fibrous composite material, thereby breaking fibres, for example, produces \na dangerously high stress concentration, with theoretical values up to a factor of 8 (Jones 1975), \nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A- Mathematical Physical and Engineering \nSciences 360 (2002) 239-253 \ndepending on the anisotropy ratio. Other early work on stress concentrations associated with cut \nouts of different geometry has been reported by Rowlands et al . (1973, 1974), Daniel et al . \n(1973, 1974) and Tirosh & Berg (1974). Strain concentration factors, on the other hand, are \nseldom reported. Whitney et al . (1982) quote some results in quasi-isotropic boron\u2013epoxy \nlaminated plates with cut-out holes from a comparative study between birefringence, classical \nstrain gauge measurements and theoretical or numerical modelling. The measured strain \nconcentration factors at the edge of the opening at the 90\u25e6 position from the load direction are \n3.34 (circular hole), 2.39 (elliptical hole, ellipticity 2, long axis parallel to load), 6.60 (elliptical \nhole, ellipticity 2, short axis parallel to load). As one would expect, the elliptical hole with short \naxis parallel to the load gives the highest strain concentration; the magnitude of the associated \nstress concentration will increase to infinity as the ellipticity increases. Work on the stress and \nstrain concentration effects in composite plates with \u2018formed\u2019 holes, where the fibres follow the \ncontour of the opening (curvilinear fibre pattern) instead of terminating at the boundary, has also \nreceived some attention (Heller & Chiba 1973; Cooper 1972; Hyer & Charrette 1991). However, \nin these studies too the emphasis has been on stress concentration and strength or buckling \nresistance reduction rather than on local deformability of the region perturbed by the holes. \n \n2. Two-dimensional model \n \nThe campaniform sensillum is basically an opening in the cuticle covered by membrane layers. \nThe shape of the opening is generally oval and sometimes almost circular. Its long and short axes \nvary from 6 to 24 \u00b5m and from 2 to 5 \u00b5m, respectively (Pringle 1938; Gnatzy et al . 1987). The \nchitin microfibrils in the cuticle extend around the hole so that it is equivalent to a formed hole in \na sheet of fibrous composite material. The control was a plate with no opening in it; the \nexperimental systems were a plate with a single circular opening in the centre, a plate with an \nelliptical opening and major axis aligned parallel to the direction of loading and a plate with an \nelliptical opening and major axis normal to the direction of loading. The experimental and \nmodelling work was carried out on plates 1.8 mm thick, 70 mm wide and 160 mm long with \ncircular holes of 7.5 mm diameter and elliptical holes of major axis 7.5 mm and minor axis 3.75 \nmm. These dimensions were chosen after verification that the perturbation due to the selected \nsize of openings did not reach the boundaries of the plate (infinite plate approximation). All the \nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A- Mathematical Physical and Engineering \nSciences 360 (2002) 239-253 \nplates were loaded up to 1000 N mm\u22121 for comparison. For the fibre orientation, two modelling \napproaches were followed. The first is based on the assumption that the presence of the hole does \nnot affect the fibre orientation, i.e. the fibres are parallel to the x-axis even very close to the hole. \nThis corresponds to the case of a hole drilled after manufacturing. In the second approach the \npresence of the hole alters the orientation so that the fibres follow the edge of the hole; this \ndisturbance relaxes gradually towards the unidirectional case away from the hole. This \ncorresponds to a hole which has been formed during manufacturing. The distribution of fibre \norientation depends on the manufacturing route, and if this manufacturing route is appropriate it \ncan be a design parameter. In this study the following orientation distribution, as expressed by the \nfibre angle relative to the to load axis, has been used: \n( )\n( ) \u23aa\u23ad\n\u23aa\u23ac\n\u23ab\n\u2264=\n\u2264\u2264+\u2212=\n,4,0,\n,4,3333.13333.0,\nrrrF\nrrr\nr\nrrF\no\noo\no\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\n      (2.1)  \nwhere r  is the distance from the opening centre, or  is the opening radius for a circular opening \nand the major half-axis for an elliptical opening, ( )\u03b8,rF  is the orientation function and \u03b8  is \ngiven by the following expression: \n\u23ad\u23ac\n\u23ab\n<\u2264\u2212\u2212=\n\u2264\u2264\u2212=\n,0180,2258333.0\n,1800,758333.0\n\u03d5\u03d5\u03b8\n\u03d5\u03b8\u03d5\u03b8\n       (2.2)  \nwhere \u03d5  is the angular coordinate for a cylindrical system of coordinates originating from the \ncentre of the opening. The following correspondence exists between the Cartesian coordinates of \na point and the cylindrical coordinates used in (2.1) and (2.2): \n( ) ( )\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23ad\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23ac\n\u23ab\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u2212\n\u2212=\n\u2212+\u2212=\n,tan\n,22\nc\nc\ncc\nxx\nyyAr\nyyxxr\n\u03d5         (2.3)  \nwhere subscript \u2018c\u2019 refers to the centre of the system of coordinates. This orientation distribution \nmeans that, in the hole region, the fibre follows the hole boundary starting from 75\u25e6 at a point \nalong the load axis (x-axis) and decreases gradually to 0\u25e6 as the direction normal to the load axis \nis approached (y-axis). This orientation behaviour relaxes gradually as the distance from the \ncentre of the hole increases and vanishes at distances greater than two hole diameters. \nThe boundary conditions used were \nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A- Mathematical Physical and Engineering \nSciences 360 (2002) 239-253 \n(i) fixed displacement at zero in all directions at one side of the plate; \n(ii) a uniformly distributed tensile and\/or shear load at the other end. \nTensile loads ranged from \u22121000 N mm\u22121 to 1000 N mm\u22121 (the minus sign corresponds \nto compression) and shear loads ranged from 50 N mm\u22121 to 300 N mm\u22121. \n \n3. Three-dimensional model \n \nThe sensillum is composed of mechanical coupling, transduction and encoding mechanisms to \ntransfer the environmental information to the insect\u2019s nervous system. The mechanical coupling \nmechanism transforms the stimulus into another form before sending it to the dendrite of the \nattached sensory cell, which acts as a transducer. \nOne of the campaniform sensilla pG4 (Gnatzy et al . 1987; Grunert & Gnatzy 1987) was selected \nfor modelling. The campaniform sensillum pG4 is located at posterior side of the second leg \n(Gnatzy et al . 1987). It is possible to construct a three-dimensional model of pG4 using one \ncross-section because of its circular shape. The coupling mechanism of the campaniform \nsensillum of C. vicina is composed of five components: (1) a cap; (2) a collar; (3) a joint \nmembrane; (4) a dome-shaped socket septum; (5) a spongy compliant zone. \nThe fine structure of the pG4 campaniform sensillum of C. vicina (Grunert & Gnatzy 1987) was \nscanned into a computer. The contours of different parts of the sensillum were extracted by \npicking points on the scanned image. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the sensillum was \ncreated by rotating this cross-section about the axis which goes vertically through the centre of \nthe sensillum. According to Saint-Venant\u2019s principle (Gere & Timoshenko 1991), end effects can \nbe neglected at locations which are at least a width of the plate away from any concentrated load, \nor from the end of the plate. Therefore, a cuticular plate was added to produce a unidirectional \nstress field. Only a quarter of the sensillum was needed, due to symmetry. The sensillum and the \ncuticle plate were discretized into 5904 eight-node 3D hexahedral elements. Different mechanical \nproperties were allocated to the components of the sensillum. All cuticular materials are assumed \nto be isotropic. Figure 1 shows the axonometric view of the 3D model. \nThe model was subjected to arbitrary tensile and compressive stresses of 3 MPa. The actual \ndimensions of the model are not critical for the comparative study for which it has been used. \nHowever, the proportions of the various parts were the same as in the real sensillum chosen to \nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A- Mathematical Physical and Engineering \nSciences 360 (2002) 239-253 \ngenerate the model. The stress is applied along the z-axis of the 3D model. The analysis was \nperformed using MARC FEA software using a nonlinear option in order to take the geometrical \nchanges into account. The calculation was performed in 12 incremental steps with the full \nNewton\u2013Raphson algorithm. The geometric stiffness matrix was updated by the Lagrangian \nmethod. \n \nFigure 1.

This was done in order to compare experimental and \nmodelling results. The dimensions of the plate and circular hole are the same as those of the 2D \nmodel. The plate comprised eight unidirectional glass\u2013epoxy layers. The finite-element mesh was \nan extension of the mesh used to represent the composite plate with a circular hole in two \ndimensions, where each of the layers was represented by a layer of brick elements. The \nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A- Mathematical Physical and Engineering \nSciences 360 (2002) 239-253 \nmechanical properties of the elements were determined experimentally (table 1) from plates \ncomprising eight layers of SE 84 HT (SP Systems) glass prepreg, uniaxially orientated, which \nhad cured for 15 h at 80 \u25e6C. The final weight fraction of fibre was 69%. No additional results \nhave been quoted for the 3D plate model because its in-plane behaviour was found to be virtually \nidentical to that of the 2D model. \n \n4. Results \n \n(a) Two-dimensional model \nFor the chosen plate dimensions and opening sizes, the global stiffness of the fibre composite \nplates used in this study is not affected significantly by the presence of holes. At the selected \nmaximum load of 1000 N mm\u22121 the average tensile strains in the load direction range from \n2.85% (no opening) to 2.94% (circular formed hole), as shown in table 2. These strain values are \nhigh for a real system but since the problem is linear they can be scaled to more realistic levels. \nPlates with formed openings tend to have slightly higher compliance. Plates containing circular \nopenings have a marginally higher compliance due to the fact that a circular opening with a \ndiameter equal to the diameter of the major axis of an ellipse occupies a greater area of the plate. \nThe changes in dimensions of the opening diameters parallel and normal to the loading were \ncalculated as a percentage elongation or shrinkage. Results for the 1000 N mm\u22121 case are given \nin table 2. The analysis is linear elastic and all the simulations showed a linear dependence of the \ndiametrical deformation on the applied load. \nThe openings amplify the local deformation up to eightfold, compared with the plate with no \nholes, and this is consistent with the reported result of the stress concentration in the vicinity of \nholes (Lekhnitskii 1968). The highest changes of dimension occur in the minor semi-axis of \ndrilled (+19.3%) or formed (+15.8%) elliptical holes with major semi-axis normal to the load \ndirection. In drilled holes the change of diameter or minor semi-axis parallel to the loading \ndirection is higher than in formed holes for circular and elliptical holes with major semi-axis \nnormal to the load. There is no significant difference of dimensional change in the major semi-\naxis between drilled and formed elliptical holes with major semi-axis parallel to the load \ndirection. As the elliptical hole orientation changes from major semi-axis normal to parallel-to-\nthe load, the local dimensional change in the load direction decreases, while that in the normal \nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A- Mathematical Physical and Engineering \nSciences 360 (2002) 239-253 \ndirection increases. This effect is maximized in an elliptical opening oriented parallel to the \nloading, where the sensitivity of the normal axis becomes higher than the sensitivity of the \nparallel axis when a formed reinforcement configuration is used. \nTable 2.

In our simplified model failure occurs when the strain energy \ndensity exceeds a value characteristic of the material. Thus, the strain energy distributions arising \nfrom the presence of openings can provide a first estimate of the strength reduction they cause \n(table 3). In the uniform plate the density is distributed uniformly across the plate except near the \nfixed boundary. This uniformity is disturbed by the presence of holes.  \nTable 3.

Drilled holes result in greater strain energy densities near the hole \nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A- Mathematical Physical and Engineering \nSciences 360 (2002) 239-253 \nboundaries and steeper gradients of its distribution in comparison with formed holes. In the worst \ncase (elliptical drilled opening orientated normal to the direction of loading) the energy density \nincreases twenty-fold compared with the intact plate. With formed holes the effect is not so \npronounced; the strain energy maximum is reduced to about half that found with the drilled hole. \nThis is illustrated by the way the strain energy concentration relaxes from its maximum close to \nthe hole to a low value remote from the hole (figure 2a, b). The strain energy density is also \ndistributed much more broadly across the specimen when the hole is formed rather than drilled. If \nthe energy density at the worse position along the boundary of a hole is normalized relative to the \nmaximum for the circular drilled hole, the various openings in table 4 can be ranked according to \nthe severity of the local strain energy density to give: 1 (circular-drilled); 0.42 (circular-formed); \n2.05 (elliptical-drilled major axis normal to load); 0.89 (elliptical-formed major axis normal to \nload); 0.43 (elliptical-drilled major axis parallel to load); 0.24 (elliptical-formed major axis \nparallel to load). The important result is that formed holes are typically half as severe as the \ndrilled ones. \nTable 4.

The Young\u2019s modulus of \nthe body cuticle of C. vicina is about 1.5 GPa (Hepburn & Joffe 1976). The output of the \ncoupling mechanism is indicated as the deformation of the dendrite of the attached sensory cell \nalong three coordinate axes of the model. Figures 3, 4 and 5 show the output curve of the \nhomogeneous model. The compressive stress is represented as a negative stress. Figure 3, which \nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A- Mathematical Physical and Engineering \nSciences 360 (2002) 239-253 \nindicates the vertical displacement of the cuticular cap, reveals that the cap indents under the \ntensile stress of the surroundings and bulges under the compressive stress. It also indicates that \nthe compressive stress causes a transverse compression of the dendritic tip in the direction of the \napplied stress. The behaviour of the system appears to be very linear, a result which is perhaps \nnot predictable a priori and interesting in its own right. \n \nFigure 2. Strain energy distribution under tension in a plate with an elliptical opening orientated \nwith its long axis parallel to the direction of loading. (a) drilled hole (left-hand scale ranges from\n1 to 95 in 11 equal steps, higher values are lighter colours); (b) formed hole (left-hand scale \nranges from 2 to 52 in 11 equal steps, higher values are lighter colours). \n \nAs far as we know the material properties of the pG4 campaniform sensillum have never been \nreported. Furthermore, there is a wide variation of material properties of the cuticle in a single \nanimal. Therefore, we tried to infer the mechanical properties of the various cuticular elements of \nthe coupling mechanism from their staining characteristics. The cuticular cap and upper parts of \nthe cuticular collar do not stain and appear non-laminated. The lower region of the collar consists \nof laminate exocuticle. In transmission electron microscopy (TEM) the socket septum is seen to \nbe fibrous. The cap and the collar therefore probably consist of relatively stiff tanned cuticle and \nthe socket septum consists of relatively pliant cuticle. In TEM, the joint membrane appears to be \nhomogeneous and is less electron-dense than the cuticle layers of the cap. The spongy cuticle, \nwhich appears transparent in TEM, probably consists of resilin (Jensen &Weis-Fogh 1962). The \nYoung\u2019s modulus of sclerite cuticle of C. vicina (Hepburn & Joffe 1976) is also used in this \nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A- Mathematical Physical and Engineering \nSciences 360 (2002) 239-253 \nmodel. Tanned cuticle is more than three times stiffer than the untanned cuticle (Vincent 1990). \nTherefore, it is assumed that the Young\u2019s modulus of the heavily tanned cuticle is four times the \nYoung\u2019s modulus of the sclerite cuticle. Although the cuticular collar comprises two different \nmaterials, it will be considered as a single material which is more pliant than tanned cuticle. The \nYoung\u2019s modulus of resilin is consistent across various species at 2 MPa (Jensen & Weis-Fogh \n1962). The stiffness of the joint membrane is regarded as between that of resilin and dry tanned \ncuticle. Its Young\u2019s modulus is assumed to be five times that of resilin. The modulus of the \nsocket septum is assumed to be a tenth of sclerite cuticle due to its low fibre content. Table 4 \nsummarizes the Young\u2019s modulus of the different components used in this model. \n \nFigure 3. Output curves of the 3D finite-element of the entire sensillum. Indentation is \nrepresented model; short dashes, heterogeneous model. \nThe output curve of the heterogeneous model is also shown in figures 3, 4 and 5. The cuticular \ncap responds in an opposite way under some loading conditions. However, it acts the same as the \nhomogeneous model in the other directions. The mechanical properties of the previous model \nwere assigned according to the information available. These properties may differ from the real \nones. Also the insect may vary the properties of the sensillum in different parts of its body in \norder to get mechanical matching between the sensillum and the surrounding cuticle. In order to \ninvestigate the effect of changes in the elastic properties of the elements on the output of the \nsensillum, a number of models were constructed. In each model, the stiffness of one of the \ncomponents was changed from +30% to \u221230% of its ordinal value in steps of 10%. Each model \nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A- Mathematical Physical and Engineering \nSciences 360 (2002) 239-253 \nwas then submitted to a compressive stress of 1 MPa. Only the vertical displacement of the \ncuticular cap is shown in this simulation (figure 6). The material properties of constituent \nmaterials affect the magnitude of the cuticular cap displacement (figure 7). However, all the \nmodels respond in the same way qualitatively. \n \nFigure 4. Output curves of the 3D finite-element model of the entire sensillum parallel to applied \nstress. Negative deformation means compression. Long dashes, homogeneous model; short \ndashes, heterogeneous model. \nIn the flat plate model, the distributions of stress and strain showed behaviour similar to that \nindicated by the 2D models. A large tensile stress developed normal to the loading at the two \ndiametrical points on the boundary of the circular opening at mid-width under compression. This \nappears to be a weak point, as the transverse strength of a unidirectional glass\/epoxy composite is \nexpected to be very low. This effect is more intense along the major axis of an elliptical hole \n(figure 2b) as the stress concentration is higher in that case. \nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A- Mathematical Physical and Engineering \nSciences 360 (2002) 239-253 \n \nFigure 5. Output curves of the 3D finite-element model of the entire sensillum perpendicular to \napplied stress. Negative deformation means compression. Long dashes, homogeneous model; \nshort dashes, heterogeneous model. \nA way to overcome this problem is to modify the laying sequence of the composite. The internal \nlayers of the laminate are subject to a lower, in comparison to the unidirectional case, normal to \nthe loading tensile stress. Thus, a cross-ply laminate is expected to have a more acceptable \nstrength under compression. Naturally, a crossply laminate will decrease the anisotropy of the \nsensing plate and consequently the strain amplification effects. However, the operating range of \nthe strain sensor will be extended without having to use a thicker sensing plate to carry the \nservice loads. \n \nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A- Mathematical Physical and Engineering \nSciences 360 (2002) 239-253 \nFigure 6.

Discussion \n \nThe results from the model with homogeneous material differ from the model with heterogeneous \nmaterial. The cap of the homogeneous model moves in the opposite direction to the cap of the \nheterogeneous model under tensile and compressive stress of the main sheet of cuticle (figure 3). \nFurthermore, the magnitude of output of the heterogeneous model is larger than that of the \nhomogeneous model in other two directions (figures 4 and 5). The material properties of \nconstituent materials influence the output of the sensillum (figure 7). Therefore, the result of the \nphysical model made of homogeneous material should be interpreted with caution since it is error \nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A- Mathematical Physical and Engineering \nSciences 360 (2002) 239-253 \nprone. The output of the coupling mechanism of the campaniform sensillum is insensitive to \nchange of the stiffness of the socket septum, the cuticular cap and the spongy cuticle (figure 7). A \n30% change in these stiffnesses causes only ca. 5% change in the output of the coupling \nmechanism. If the joint membrane is a stimulus transferring component, the change of output will \nbe equal to or greater than the change of stiffness of the joint membrane. A larger stimulus can be \ntransferred into the coupling mechanism when the stiffness of the joint membrane increases. \nHowever, the output of the coupling mechanism alters by 15% after a 30% change of the stiffness \nof the joint membrane. This suggests that the joint membrane is not a stimulus-transferring \ncomponent. The joint membrane may serve as a gap-filler. \nA 30% change of stiffness of the collar causes a 45% change of the output of the coupling \nmechanism; i.e. the change is amplified by 1.5 times. The collar consists of two parts: tanned \ncuticle in the upper region and laminated exocuticle in the lower part. The elastic properties of \nthe collar can be altered by changing the thickness of tanned cuticle of the collar. Therefore, we \nspeculate that the collar can tune the sensitivity of sensillum by changing its material properties. \nFurther investigation is required to prove this hypothesis. \nThurm et al . (1975) conducted an electrophysiological and electromicroscopical study of the \ndirectional relation between stimulating deformations of the campaniform sensilla, which occur \nas a sensillum field at the base of the fly haltere, and the axes of this dendritic terminal. They \ndeduced that stimulus increases the radius of the cuticular base plane by flattening the sensillum \nfield. In turn, the width of the clefts between the arch-shaped collars is reduced by folding of the \nepicuticular joint membrane and compression of the space beneath. As a consequence, the tip of \ndendritic terminal is compressed by the socket septum transversely to its flat sides. Spinola & \nChapman (1975) found that one of their \u2018group 6\u2019 campaniform sensilla on the cockroach tibia \nwas stimulated by combinations of proprioceptive and punctuate stimuli. They inferred that the \nproprioceptive force indents the cap of the sensillum. They also suggested that the cap amplifies \nthe cuticular strain to squeeze the tip of the dendritic sensory process. \nThe deformation of the heterogeneous model under compressive stress is shown in figure 6. It is \nassumed in this investigation that the proprioceptive force is a compressive stress and that the \ndendritic tip is squeezed in the direction of the applied stress field. On the other hand, no notable \ncompression of the dendritic tip is shown in the direction perpendicular to the applied stress field. \nThe proprioception indents the cap of model with constructed with heterogeneous materials. This \nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A- Mathematical Physical and Engineering \nSciences 360 (2002) 239-253 \nresult agrees with Spinola & Chapman (1975). Some researchers (Spinola & Chapman 1975; \nMoran et al . 1976) suggest that the structure of the cap mechanically amplifies the cuticular \nstrain to squeeze the tip of the dendritic sensory process. We cannot show amplification because \nour input data are qualitative. However, we can say that the coupling mechanism of the pG4 \ncampaniform sensillum of C. vicina acts as a mechanical linkage which transform the applied \nforce into two deformations in different direction. The deformation in the plane of the applied \nstress is more than twice the vertical deformation (comparing figures 3 and 4). The major \nexcitatory deformation appears to be the compression of the dendritic tip parallel to the \nproprioceptive force. Although the vertical cap displacement may be a side effect produced by \nproprioceptive stimulation, the role of such displacement needs further investigation before a firm \nconclusion can be drawn. \nTable 5.

The shape of the opening \nand the arrangement of reinforcement around it can be widely varied offering a high degree of \nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A- Mathematical Physical and Engineering \nSciences 360 (2002) 239-253 \nflexibility for the design of a strain monitoring system. For example, when maximum \namplification is required and the operational life of the sensing plate is not important, a drilled \nelliptical opening oriented vertically to the applied load can be used in order to achieve an \namplification of the measured deformation by a factor of eight. In contrast, when the operational \nlife of the sensing plate plays a role in the design, a formed elliptical hole will offer lower but still \nsignificant amplification accompanied by higher strength. In any case the sensing plate design \ncan be optimized in a way that will combine both the strain amplification and strength \nrequirements of a specific application. \nA variety of solutions exists for the realization of sensing of the diametrical deformations (table \n5). The use of a paste material enables the sensing device to store the maximum deformation. \nSuch a technique offers the advantage of automated \u2018telltale\u2019 sensing at low cost. More \nsophisticated solutions involving the combination of conventional strain monitoring techniques \nwith an appropriate electronic circuit can offer the ability to store information, combined with \nhigh accuracy. \nA sensing system based on the use of a fibrous composite offers great flexibility, which can result \nin a wide range of designs. Such a sensing system can be tailored to the deformation \namplification, strength and measurement output requirements of specific applications. \n \nThis study was supported by a Realizing Our Potential Award from EPSRC (ref.
