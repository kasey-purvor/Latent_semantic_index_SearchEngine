The size of this critical nucleus was estimated to be of the order of only a\nfew lysozyme molecules.\nIntroduction\nThe adsorption of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) at the\nsolid\/liquid interface presents some unusual features.1 At low\nionic strength, the observation of the absence of the usual\ne\u2020ects of excluded area2 was taken to imply the formation of\none-dimensional aggregates at the surface. The predicted exis-\ntence of these aggregates was later con\u00d0rmed by direct obser-\nvation in the atomic force microscope.3\nElectrostatic potential calculations on the surface of the\nHEWL molecule suggest that this self-association process,\nmediated by the presence of the surface, is related to the asym-\nmetry of the charge distribution and the corresponding large\ndipole moment of about 70 D\u201d at pH 7.0.4 Our previous\nresults1 are also consistent with observations of lysozyme self-\naggregation in bulk solution under certain conditions.5h7\nAlthough ionic strength e\u2020ects on protein adsorption\nkinetics have been previously examined,8 investigators have\ngenerally con\u00d0ned themselves to the most common salt, NaCl.\nIndeed, one of the few comparative experiments (on serum\nalbumin9) showed very signi\u00d0cant di\u2020erences between adsorp-\ntion on silica\u00c8titania in the presence of either phosphate (a\nkosmotropic salt10,11) and NaCl. The signi\u00d0cant di\u2020erence\nobserved between the adsorption of lysozyme and chymotryp-\nsinogen A on butylated and aminopropylated quartz surfaces\nat pH 7.0 in the presence of either NaCl or (also a(NH4)2SO4kosmotrope)12,13 was attributed to a modi\u00d0cation of the\ninterfacial tension of the protein\/solution interface.\nHere we report our \u00d0nding that HEWL adsorption on an\namorphous silica\u00c8titania surface in the presence of the strongly\n\u00a4 Present address : Laboratoire de spectrome\u008d trie de masse bio-\norganique, CNRS UMR 75-09, Institut de Chimie, 1 rue Blaise\nPascal, 67008 Strasbourg Ce\u008d dex, France.

The adsorption\nwas followed in real time by means of optical waveguide light-\nmode spectroscopy (OWLS), a technique which enables\nprotein surface concentration to be measured with an accu-\nracy of a few ng cm~2.14\nExperimental\nBu\u2020er solutions\nHepes [N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N@-(2-ethanesulfonic\nacid)] was purchased from Sigma. NaCl (Merck) and NaSCN\n(Fluka) were both of analytical grade. All solutions were pre-\npared from Nanopure water (resistivity [17.8 M) cm). The\npH was adjusted to 7.4 by means of freshly prepared 1.0 M\nNaOH solutions and checked by means of a calibrated glass\nelectrode (Inlab 422, Mettler Toledo, Switzerland).\nHepes has a of 7.5 at 298 K and is thus 44.3% disso-pKaciated at pH 7.4. Hence the concentration of dissociated mol-\necules is 4.43] 10~3 M in 10~2 M bu\u2020er. By assuming that\nonly the free ions and not the zwitterionic molecules contrib-\nute to the screening of the electrostatic interactions, the Debye\nscreening length is 2.53 nm (if all Hepes molecules contribute\nequally to the electrostatic screening, whether in the disso-\nciated or zwitterionic form, then the Debye length is 2.15 nm).\nTherefore, the range of electrostatic interactions is close to the\nmolecular dimensions of HEWL (4.5] 3.0] 3.0 nm3).15\nProtein solutions\nHEWL from Sigma (ref. L-6876, lot 65H7025) was used\nwithout further puri\u00d0cation. If not otherwise stated, concen-\ntrated mother protein solutions (about 104 lg cm~3 in bu\u2020er,\n10~2 M Hepes ]10~2 M 1 : 1 electrolyte) were prepared\nshortly before the beginning of an adsorption experiment,\ndiluted to the desired concentration about 10 min later, and\nintroduced into the OWLS cell after a further 10 min.\nPhys.

(3).\nSince lysozyme is known to crystallize at relatively low con-\ncentrations in the presence of thiocyanate ions at pH 4.5 and\n291 K,16,17 we checked the association state at pH 7.4 using\nanalytical ultracentrifugation18 (sedimentation velocity (SV)\nand sedimentation equilibrium (SE) runs in a Beckman model\nXLA analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an optical\nabsorption system). The SV runs were carried out in 1.2 cm\nepon cells at 293 K and 5.6] 104 rotations per minute (giving\nan acceleration of about 2.4] 105 g) and SE experiments were\nperformed at the same temperature at 3.0 ] 104 rpm (giving\nabout 7 ] 104 g) in a laboratory-made 0.4 cm DS cell. The\nreason for using two di\u2020erent kinds of cells is to ensure\napproximately the same absorbance in both SE and SV\nexperiments. The HEWL solution (9.7] 102 lg cm~3) was\nprepared about 12 h before the beginning of the centrifugation\nexperiments which themselves lasted 12 to 16 h, i.e. far longer\nthan the duration of an adsorption experiment. Protein aggre-\ngation in solution, if it occurs, is therefore liable to be overesti-\nmated. Mean molecular weights were determined by \u00d0tting\nthe logarithm of the absorbance at 280 nm vs. the square of\nthe radial distance from the rotation axis. We used a value of\n0.72 cm3 g~1 for the partial speci\u00d0c volume of HEWL19 in\nagreement with the value derived from X-ray di\u2020raction\ndata.20 The sedimentation coefficients at 20 \u00a1C, areS20, W ,1.56] 10~13 s and 1.61] 10~13 s for 10~2 M NaCl and\nNaSCN in Hepes bu\u2020er respectively.\nThe average molecular weight derived from the ultracentri-\nfugation experiment 1.40] 104 and 1.39] 104 g mol~1 in\nNaSCN and NaCl respectively is close to that calculated from\nthe amino acid sequence (14305 g mol~1 when the four di-\nsul\u00d0de bridges are formed) and there is no signi\u00d0cant di\u2020erence\nbetween the two electrolytes. Hence we conclude that at this\nconcentration of NaSCN, HEWL is in the same aggregation\nstate as in the presence of NaCl, i.e. mainly in the monomeric\nform. Note, however, that the solutions used for the ultracen-\ntrifugation experiments were about 10 times less concentrated\nthan the mother solutions subsequently diluted for the\nadsorption experiments. Although this high concentration\nmight play a ro\u00fc le in promoting aggregation, it is probably\nnegligible since this very concentrated protein solution was\naged for only 10 min and then diluted at least 70 times, upon\nwhich any preformed aggregates would redissolve. No sedi-\nmentation cells thin enough to allow use of the same concen-\ntrations as those used for the preparation of the adsorption\nmother solutions were available.\nThe refractive index increment dn\/dc of lysozyme whose\nvalue is necessary for a precise calculation of the surface con-\ncentration, has been measured by means of Rayleigh interfer-\nometry (LI3 interferometer, Carl Zeiss, Jena).21 In Hepes\nbu\u2020er containing 10~2 M NaSCN, the refractive index\nincrement, 0.272 cm3 g~1, is signi\u00d0cantly higher than the 0.186\ncm3 g~1 measured in presence of 10~2 M NaCl.\nSurface cleaning and characterization\nPlanar optical waveguides consist of a thin and amorphous\nsol\u00c8gel22 oxide layer coated onto 48] 16 ] 0.5SiO2\u00c8TiO2mm Schott Desag AF45 glass substrates (refractive index nS \\at 298 K and at 632.8 nm). is present in the \u00d0lm1.52578 TiO2as anatase as demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy.23 A 2\nmm wide di\u2020raction grating with a periodicity of 2403 mm~1\nwas produced by embossing before pyrolysis of the sol\u00c8gel\noxide layer.22 The assembly of the glass substrate and the\nmixed oxide with its grating coupler constitutes a chip. These\nchips were cleaned with ethanol, Nanopure water, 10~2 M\nSDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) solutions at 80 \u00a1C for about\n10 min, again Nanopure water, 0.1 M HCl at 80 \u00a1C for\n10 min, extensively rinsed with Nanopure water and \u00d0nally\nequilibrated in bu\u2020er for at least 2 h.\nOWLS\nThe chips were mounted beneath and sealed to an anodized\naluminium \u00d1ow-through cuvette with a per\u00d1uorinated o-ring\nDupont), which in turn was mounted in an IOS-1(Kalrez},\nintegrated optics scanner (Arti\u00d0cial Sensing Instruments,\nZu\u008e rich).24 Deaerated bu\u2020er, \u00d0ltered through 0.2 lm pore\ndiameter Millisart membranes (Sartorius), \u00d1owed over the\nsurface until the baseline was stable (drift of the e\u2020ective\nrefractive index lower than 10~6 min~1). Freshly prepared\nprotein solution then \u00d1owed through the same type of \u00d0lter at\na constant rate of 2.46 ll s~1 (checked by weighing), corre-\nsponding to a wall shear rate and Reynolds number of 16.6\n3668 Phys.

Finally, the chip was removed and cleaned as described\nabove.\nTemperature was monitored by means of a Pt-100 resist-\nance localized in the aluminium sample holder close to the\nchip. All experiments (Table 1) took place within the tem-\nperature range 297\u00c8301 K, but within an individual experi-\nment temperature \u00d1uctuations were controlled within ^0.1 K.\nThe zeroth transverse electric and transverse magnetic e\u2020ec-\ntive refractive indices were continuously recorded during all\nstages of each experiment.\nThe thickness and the refractive index of the oxidedF nFlayer were evaluated by \u00d0tting a three layer model25 to the\ne\u2020ective refractive indices obtained in the steady response\nre\u008d gime during initial bu\u2020er equilibration. The reproducibility\nof our cleaning method was checked by comparing (dF , nF)values from experiment to experiment (Table 1) We observed\na sudden decrease in and a concomitant increase in afterdF nF7 to 10 experimental cycles, possibly due to acid induced\nsurface etching. We stopped using that chip at that point. As\nan additional check, a chip previously exposed to protein was\ncleaned as described, dried in the presence of anhydrous\nand the central region of the di\u2020raction gratingCuSO4 ,analyzed in air using atomic force microscopy (Nanoscope III,\nDigital Instruments, Santa Barbara, California). The root\nmean square roughness of this region was found to be 0.84\nnm, relatively small compared with the size of HEWL.15\nMoreover, no trace of any residual protein islands could be\ndetected, indicating quantitative removal of the adsorbed\nHEWL by our cleaning method.\nAt a bu\u2020er pH of 7.4, the oxide surface is negatively charged\n(the points of zero charge for pure silica and titania in the\nanatase form are 2.5 and 5.8 respectively26,27) whereas the\nprotein carries a net positive charge of about 8 elementary\ncharges (its isoelectric point is 11.115). At present, we do not\nknow if a highly polarizable anion such as SCN~ adsorbs spe-\nci\u00d0cally to the oxide surface. However, strong interactions\nbetween the protein and thiocyanate ions have been\ncharacterized28 at neutral pH, probably modifying the surface\ncharge density of HEWL and hence its interactions with the\nmixed oxide surface.\nThe number of HEWL molecules adsorbed per unit area of\nthe \u00d1at surface was calculated from the measured e\u2020ective\nrefractive indices as described previously.29\nResults and discussion\nTypical adsorption kinetics in 10~2 M NaSCN and 10~2 M\nHepes bu\u2020er at pH 7.4 are shown in Fig. 1. The most inter-\nesting observation is the occurrence of a reproducible lag\nphase in the HEWL adsorption kinetics at protein concentra-\ntions lower than about 50 lg cm~3. The lower the protein\nconcentration in solution, the longer the lag phase (Fig. 1 and\nTable 1). Its duration can be estimated from the interval\nbetween the beginning of protein \u00d1ow (t \\ 0) and the\noccurrence of the maximum adsorption rate, (the point of\nin\u00d1exion in the kinetics). At bulk concentrations higher than\nabout 50 lg cm~3, the initial adsorption rate becomes so fast\nthat the in\u00d1exion point occurs after about 100 to 200 s, not\nsigni\u00d0cantly more than the time required for reaching steady\nstate in the formation of the di\u2020usion boundary layer, namely\nabout 120 s.\nMoreover, in the lower concentration re\u008d gime only, we\nfound the maximum adsorption rate to be equal to the rate of\ndi\u2020usive convection of HEWL from the bulk of the solution\nto the surface (Fig. 1), taking the di\u2020usion coefficient of mono-\nmeric HEWL to be 1.04] 10~6 cm2 s~1.15 The observed lag\nFig. 1 Some representative adsorption kinetics of HEWL dissolved\nin 10~2 M Hepes bu\u2020er with 10~2 M NaSCN on the Si0.8Ti0.2O2surface of chip 1.

At bulk con-\ncentrations higher than about 50 lg cm~3, a maximum in the\nadsorption rate appears at very short times (Table 1). At\npresent we do not know if this originates from an hydrody-\nnamic e\u2020ect or from critical nucleus formation. In any case,\nthe maximal adsorption rates for these higher HEWL concen-\ntrations are signi\u00d0cantly lower than those predicted for the\ntransport of monomers to the interface (Fig. 2).\nThe occurrence of a possible nucleation re\u008d gime in the\nadsorption kinetics at protein concentrations lower than\nabout 50 lg cm~3 is further illustrated by the following\nexperiment : a 10 lg cm~3 lysozyme solution was stored after\ndilution at ambient temperature in a closed glass container of\nthe mother solution. Part of this solution was used as usual 10\nmin after dilution for an adsorption experiment, and the rest\nused 3 h later, after which the lag phase duration was much\nshorter (Fig. 3). This suggests the formation of nuclei in the\nbulk solution before adsorption to the surface. Once a few\naggregates are adsorbed, fast adsorption, i.e. a kind of crys-\ntallization, proceeds. When the preincubation time is shorter,\nfewer preformed aggregates are present. Let us assume that\nFig. 2 Evolution of the maximal adsorption rate with the concentra-\ntion of dissolved HEWL, as measured at the in\u00d1exion points of the\nadsorption kinetics.

(1) and (2), and setting c* to namelyC*\/dA ,the volumetric concentration in the surface \u00d0lm at the in\u00d1ex-\nion point of the adsorption kinetics (about 0.5 g cm~3), one\nobtains :\nJ* \\\n1\nm\nAdC\ndt\nB\nC\/CR\n\\\nAD\ndA4\nBC C*\ncB dA\nDnR\n(3)\nwhere m is the mass of an adsorbing monomer. The fact that\nwe normalize the adsorption rate with the mass of a monomer\noriginates from the observation of Fig. 2 : the maximal adsorp-\ntion rate is that corresponding to di\u2020usion\u00c8convection of par-\nticles mainly in the monomeric state.\nHence the size of the critical nucleus can be calculated from\nthe measured value of the maximum adsorption rate. Taking\ntypical values of C* \\ 0.12 lg cm~2 (Fig. 4, and Table 1), a\nmaximal adsorption rate of 1.5 ng cm~2 s~1 (Fig. 4) and cB \\lg cm~3, one obtains n* B 1 to 3. Values for each indi-40\nvidual experiment are listed in Table 1. This n* value appears\nnot to be inconsistent with the results of our ultracentrifugation\nexperiments (see Experimental part) : if the concentrated\nlysozyme solution contained a signi\u00d0cant amount of very big\naggregates, then the mean molecular weight of the sediment-\ning particles would not have been so close to that of mono-\nmeric HEWL. However, we are not able to characterize such\nsmall aggregates with ultracentrifugation, but will attempt to\ndo so by means of light scattering in subsequent work.\nBimodal adsorption of bovine serum albumin or human\nIgG on latex particles from pH 7.4 phosphate bu\u2020er has been\ninterpreted as a kind of crystallization at the interface,31 with\nFig. 4 Representative curves of the time derivative of the surface\nconcentration of adsorbed HEWL as a function of C, for bulk concen-\ntrations of 1 2 and 5 lg cm~3(L), (K) (|).\nthe size of the critical nucleus estimated to be of the order of 5\nto 10 molecules.31\nSCN~ ions are well known for their ability to crystallize\nHEWL at acidic pH.16,17 Moreover, many proteins are\nknown to have a strong affinity for thiocyanate ions,28 hence,\nat the high concentrations of protein close to the interface, the\nSCN~ ions may interact strongly with the proteins. This has\nbeen demonstrated at pH 4.75 in acetate bu\u2020er16,17 but no\ndirect proof is available at the moment at the pH of our\nexperiments.\nFurther work would also need to investigate the in\u00d1uence\nof the thiocyanate concentration on the observed process and\nprovide a complete description of the adsorption kinetics with\na mathematical model combining the two principal character-\nistics we identi\u00d0ed from our experiments, namely the presence\nof an in\u00d1exion point, attributed to efficient adsorption on the\ndeposited nuclei and saturation at a coverage close to what is\npredicted for a monolayer, attibuted to a surface exclusion\nphenomenon between the growing clusters.\nIn this work we have described the occurrence of the lag\nphases (Fig. 1) in terms of the time needed to reach the critical\nnucleus size in solution before the onset of fast adsorption.\nHowever, our preparation of the mother protein solution from\nthe lyophilized powder and the small time allowed for equili-\nbration of the diluted HEWL solution before the beginning of\nthe adsorption experiment may hinder complete hydration of\nthe protein and hence could be the source of an alternative\nexplanation for the observed phenomenology. Indeed e\u2020ects\nrationalized by means of the Hofmeister series are strongly\nrelated to biopolymer hydration.10,11 The question of the\nhydration and structure of HEWL in the presence of SCN~\nanions will also be considered in our forthcoming studies.\nAcknowledgements\nthank the Ciba Geigy Jubilee Foundation for \u00d0nancialWe\nsupport and one of the anonymous referees for stimulating\ndiscussions about hydration and its e\u2020ects on the physical and\nbiological properties of proteins.\nReferences\n1 V.
