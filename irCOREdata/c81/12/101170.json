ALEXANDER\nABSTRACT. This article discusses state support of artists in the United \nKingdom, focusing on the Arts Council England. To understand the pres-\nent\u2014or the future\u2014support of visual artists, one needs to understand the \npast. Accordingly, the article begins with a brief history of the Arts Council \nof Great Britain from 1946, discussing Thatcher\u2019s reforms after the 1979 \nelection. Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour continued many of the same strategies \ninstituted by the Conservatives. At the same time as fiscal constraints and \n\u201centerprise culture\u201d were imposed, the mission of the Arts Council was broad-\nened to include both geographical representation and a more populist agenda. \nA review of the contemporary arrangements for state support of artists in the \nUnited Kingdom shows that many of the tensions that exist within today\u2019s \nArts Council were institutionalized in its early days. The article concludes \nwith a comment on what the current situation may portend for the future. \nor many, the phrase \u201cstate support of artists\u201d suggests direct financial \nsupport, through fellowships, purchase of art works, or funding of \narts organizations. Elsewhere, I have argued, with Marilyn Rueschemeyer, \nthat state support should be construed more broadly (Alexander and \nVictoria D. Alexander is senior lecturer in the sociology department at the University of \nSurrey in England. She is author of Sociology of the Arts: Exploring Fine and Popular \nForms (2003) and Museums and Money: The Impact of Funding on Exhibitions, \nScholarship and Management, and coauthor of Art and the State: The Visual Arts in \nComparative Perspective (2005).

For the purposes of this article, however, I will con-\ncentrate on state support in the narrow sense: cultural policy at the national \nlevel that provides monetary support to artists. The specific focus of this \narticle is the Arts Council of England (ACE)1; the particular concern is with \nvisual artists\u2014painters, sculptors, and the like\u2014who could be said to be \n\u201cfine artists.\u201d Many of my comments, however, will include reference to \npractitioners in other disciplines and to the arts in general. The discussion \nwill necessarily be broad-brush, as this \u201cpolicy area\u201d is both diverse and \nfragmented. For the most part, I ignore Scotland and Wales and the support \noffered by local government. \nTo gain a view of arts funding in Tony Blair\u2019s Britain, I begin with the \npast, based on the premise that an understanding of the tensions that have \nbeen institutionalized in the Arts Council from its inception and the chang-\nes\u2014borne by political winds\u2014that it has weathered since will provide some \nperspective on the present situation.\nThe \u201cNationalization\u201d of Culture\nJanet Minihan (1977) suggests that the arts were \u201cnationalized\u201d along with \nother services and industries after World War II. Indeed, the Arts Council of \nGreat Britain, chartered in 1946, grew out of a wartime cultural enrichment \nprogram, the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA; \nn.d.), which focused on keeping up morale on the home front. CEMA orga-\nnized many events that were consistent with its motto, \u201cThe Best for the \nMost.\u201d One example was \u201cArt for the People,\u201d a travelling exhibition. The \nshow included works that CEMA purchased, which, according to CEMA, \nwere \u201cnot to show supreme examples of art, but rather to give illustrations of \npleasing and competent contemporary work which might be bought by ordi-\nnary people and lived with in ordinary houses\u201d (n.d., qtd. in Wu 2002, 34). \nJohn Maynard Keynes, \u201cnot a man for wandering minstrels and amateur \ntheatricals\u201d (Sir Kenneth Clark, qtd. in Wu 2002, 34), assumed the chairman-\nship of CEMA in 1942. Under his influence, CEMA shifted its focus from \nthe popular arts toward the interests of the art establishment and the social \nelite. In his address to the nation, broadcast on the BBC Home Service on \nthe founding of the Arts Council, Keynes said, in an often-quoted remark, \u201cI \ndo not believe it is yet realized what an important thing has happened. State \npatronage of the arts has crept in. It has happened in a very English, informal, \nunostentatious way\u2014half baked if you like\u201d (1945\/1991, 106). A key feature \nof the Arts Council was that it was set up at \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d to the government. \nThe Arts Council was an independent, chartered body that was, as Keynes put \nit, \u201cfree from red tape, but financed by the Treasury.\u201d (105). Its job was to \nrespond to external initiatives, not to generate them.\nFall 2007 3\nArticle Name\nUnder Keynes\u2019s stewardship, the Arts Council showed a preference for \nexcellence over popularity, as suggested by the slogan \u201cFew, but roses\u201d \n(Pearson 1982, 56). Nevertheless, a tension existed in the Arts Council \nbetween the goals of \u201craising\u201d and \u201cspreading.\u201d \u201cRaising\u201d implies a focus on \nhigh standards of aesthetic excellence, often London based, that would raise \nthe level of public taste. \u201cSpreading\u201d refers to increasing audiences for and \naccess to the arts by bringing art to the people, especially in locations outside \nLondon. These tensions\u2014between raising and spreading and between excel-\nlence and popularity\u2014were institutionalized in the early days of the Arts \nCouncil, and they continue to underpin current debates about state funding \nfor the arts.\nIn his founding speech, Keynes inadvertently highlighted the distinct and \ncontradicting missions of the Arts Council:\nThe task of an official body is not to teach or censor, but to give courage, \nconfidence and opportunity. . . . New work will spring up more abundantly . . . \nwhen there is a universal opportunity for contact with traditional and contem-\nporary arts in their noblest forms. . . . But do not think of the Arts Council as \na schoolmaster. Your enjoyment will be our first aim. (106; emphasis added)\nThe Arts Council inherited panels for music, drama, and art from CEMA. It \nplaced greater emphasis on the performing than the visual arts. Nevertheless, \nthe Visual Arts Department supported painting through the Arts Council \nCollection, which was made up of contemporary works purchased for the \ncollection and from which touring exhibitions were selected. \nIn general, the Arts Council\u2019s budget and remit increased steadily from \n1946 to 1979, when the new Tory Government ushered in a new era for state-\nsupported arts. But the situation changed in 1979 when Margaret Thatcher \ncame to power. \nThe \u201cPrivatization\u201d of Culture\nIn her first few years as prime minister, Thatcher reduced government \nfunding for the arts, changed the governance structure of museums, and put \nin place incentives for private (especially corporate) arts sponsorship. These \nactions were consistent with Thatcher\u2019s policy of \u201crolling back the frontiers of \nthe state.\u201d Thatcher\u2019s first Art Minister, Norman St John-Stevas, reinforced this \nmessage by warning arts organizations to seek alternative sources of funds:\nThe arts world must . . . accept the fact that Government policy . . . has \ndecisively tilted away from the expansion of the public to the enlargement \nof the private sector. The Government fully intends to honour its pledge to \nmaintain public support for the arts . . . but we look to the private sphere \nto meet any shortfall and to provide immediate means of increase. (qtd. in \nBaldry 1981, 34) \n4 Vol. 29, No. 1\n The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society\nThe arts, unlike many national industries, were not literally privatized. \nNevertheless, the changes instituted by the Conservative Government sig-\nnificantly altered the relationship between state and art, in a climate of fiscal \nausterity. Notably, Thatcher\u2019s policies reflected a shift in how the arts were to \nbe valued and managed.\nCrucial to this shift is the notion of \u201centerprise culture,\u201d which Thatcher \nsought to instill throughout \u201cUK, plc.\u201d Enterprise culture enshrines the val-\nues of liberal economics, emphasizing three key principles: the efficiency of \nmarkets, the liberty of individuals, and the noninterventionism of the state. \nThe opposite of enterprise culture is the \u201cculture of dependency,\u201d which \nimplies that organizations or individuals are dependent on the \u201cnanny state.\u201d2 \nUnder Thatcher, government was no longer to be seen as the sole provider of \nfunds for the public sector. Organizations such as museums, universities, and \nthe National Health Service were pressed to run themselves in the manner \nof private businesses, to use marketing tools to serve \u201ccustomers,\u201d to meet \ntargets, and to provide \u201cvalue for money.\u201d These organizations, among them \nArts Council clients, were required to seek supplemental funding from private \nsources in what is now called a \u201cmixed-economy\u201d approach.\nEnterprise culture was foisted on charities and public bodies throughout \nthe decade. Anthony Beck commented that Tory arts policies are\none with the general cultural strategy of \u201cthe Thatcher revolution\u201d which sets up \nbusiness as the ideal-type of all social activity\u2014understanding \u201cbusiness\u201d as a \nmythical representation of early capitalism, entrepreneurial, buccaneering, pro-\ngressive. The cultural transformation of the management of the arts institutions \nto make them bold, inventive and energised is a central element of [Thatcher\u2019s] \npolicy for the arts. (1989, 370)\nI have stated that the Tories reduced funding to the arts. In fact, the Grant-\nin-Aid awarded the Arts Council did increase during Thatcher\u2019s tenure, but \nin many years grants grew at less than the rate of inflation. Further, the rate \nof growth was slow compared the trajectory from 1946. Moreover, a greater \nproportion of the allocated funds were earmarked for specific purposes. Funds \nwere devolved to the regions or were granted to replace (but only partially) \nfunds lost elsewhere\u2014for instance, after Thatcher eliminated the Greater \nLondon Council in 1983.\nTwo other aspects of Thatcher\u2019s policies are worth mentioning here. First, \nthe government undertook various efforts to encourage private, and especially \ncorporate, sponsorship of the arts, for example, through changes to tax law \nand through \u201cChallenge\u201d schemes, whereby funds raised elsewhere would be \nmatched in varying proportion by state funds. The government worked with \nthe Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts (ABSA; now called \nArts and Business), a nonprofit organization established in 1976 to encour-\nage corporate philanthropy in the cultural arena. In 1980, the Tories granted \nFall 2007 5\nArticle Name\n\u00a325,000 to ABSA to help it raise funds for arts institutions from the private \nsector. Many observers at the time thought this money should have been \nspent directly on the arts rather than channeled into a business charity (Wu \n2002, 55). The state\u2019s relationship with ABSA was formalized in 1984 when \nthe government established the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme. \nThe scheme, administered by the ABSA on behalf of the Office for Arts and \nLibraries, used financial incentives to encourage corporate sponsors, match-\ning private funds up to \u00a335,000.\nSecond, Thatcher emphasized \u201cvalue for money.\u201d The 1983 National Audit \nAct, for instance, empowered the auditor general to assess government depart-\nments and public agencies in terms of the three e\u2019s: \u201ceconomy, efficiency and \neffectiveness\u201d (Hewison 1995, 256). Along with other public services, arts \norganizations were thereby required to produce and meet performance indica-\ntors that measured such outcomes as attendance and access, and they were \nrequired to engage in forward planning that set targets against which future \nperformance would be measured.\nIn sum, Thatcher\u2019s impact on the arts amounted to a dramatic shift in empha-\nsis from the arts themselves\u2014whether in the form of art world concerns with \nexcellence or policymakers\u2019 concerns with access\u2014to the prudent management \nof the arts. The arts were now to be judged by economic yardsticks and were \nexhorted to throw off the culture of dependency, pull up their socks, and look \nfor additional funding elsewhere, a task that proved difficult for many in the arts \nworld. In the words of Richard Luce, the arts minister, speaking in 1987, \u201cthere \nare still too many in the arts world yet to be weaned from the welfare state \nmentality\u2014the attitude that the taxpayer owes them a living. Many have not yet \naccepted the challenge of developing plural sources of funding\u201d (qtd. in Beck \n1989, 367\u201368). But the government persisted in its insistence for change.\nRobert Hewison points out another consequence of corporate funding \nand government emphasis on enterprise culture\u2014the arts would now have to \ngrapple with a dictionary\u2019s worth of business jargon. Hewison writes:\nBusiness sponsorship has already changed the language of the arts. [The direc-\ntor of the ABSA Colin] Tweedy remarks that \u201carts organizations often fail to \nunderstand that they are selling a product to a potential customer and have to \ndeliver benefits accordingly.\u201d The Minister for the Arts speaks of \u201cthe delivery \nof the art product\u201d to \u201cconsumers of art.\u201d This language has been enthusiasti-\ncally embraced by the Arts Council . . . which presented its bid for increased \ngovernment funding in 1986\/87 in terms of a business prospectus: \u201cthe money \nspent from the public purse on the arts is a first-rate investment. (1987, 128; \nemphasis added)\nToday, this way of speaking has become so common that we tend to take it for \ngranted. But it is worth pointing out that only thirty years ago, almost no one \ntalked about the arts in these terms.\n6 Vol. 29, No. 1\n The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society\nJohn Major\u2019s Contribution\nJohn Major was elected prime minister in 1990. Shortly after the 1992 \nGeneral Election, he formed the Department of National Heritage, which \nassumed to the responsibilities of the former Office of Arts and Libraries \nas well as English heritage, sport, film, and tourism. He also continued \nThatcher\u2019s policies of cutting public funds, encouraging private ones, and \ninculcating a managerial approach to the arts.\nMajor presided over two important changes to the public funding of \nthe arts in Great Britain. First, in 1994, the Arts Councils of Wales and of \nScotland, technically subcommittees of the Arts Council of Great Britain, \nbecame formally independent and drew their funding from the Welsh and \nScottish offices. The Arts Council of Great Britain ceased to exist, and the \nArts Council of England (ACE) replaced it.\nIn 1994, the second, dramatic change occurred\u2014the launch of the National \nLottery. The lottery was to raise funds for \u201cgood causes\u201d that would serve as \nan addition to state funds, rather than replace existing appropriations. Twenty-\neight percent of the income for the lottery was split evenly between the five \ninitial good causes and was distributed by designated bodies, including the \nArts Council (Gray 2000, 119). In the lottery\u2019s first year, the arts received \nmore than \u00a3250 million (76).\nThe National Lottery has engendered popular debates on how money \nraised should be spent. The lottery is a regressive funding mechanism, in the \nsense that those with lower incomes spend more on the lottery than those \nwith higher incomes. Some observers suggest that a greater proportion of \nlottery funds should be used to benefit areas of interest to those who play \nthe lottery, such as sport, and that the more highbrow projects beloved by \nthose who do not play the lottery, such as the visual arts, should receive \nfewer or no funds.\nNew Labour\nTony Blair\u2019s New Labour government came into power in 1997, and many \nin the arts world were hopeful that his government would reverse trends set by \nthe previous administration and usher in a new, more positive era for the arts. \nSignificantly, New Labour changed the name of the Department of National \nHeritage to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. Chris Smith, the \nfirst culture secretary under Blair, said of this change: \u201cwe wanted something \nmore forward looking, a name that captured more accurately the new spirit of \nmodern Britain, that signalled the involvement of all\u201d (1998, 2). The name fit \nmore comfortably with Labour\u2019s early emphasis on \u201cCool Britannia,\u201d whereas \nthe Department of National Heritage sounded old-fashioned and backward \nFall 2007 7\nArticle Name\nlooking. Along with the new title, New Labour set out four key themes for the \ndepartment: access, excellence, education, and economic value. \nThe Blair government did increase the financial support given to the arts; \nin Blair\u2019s ten years in power, ACE\u2019s budget again grew strongly. At the same \ntime, his government\u2019s rhetoric on the arts has tended toward populism. In \n1998, Chris Smith wrote, \nAll of these themes [access, excellence, education, and economic value] are \ninterlinked around the focal point of the individual citizen, no matter how high \nor low their station, having the chance to share cultural experience. . . . This is \na profoundly democratic agenda, seeing cultural access as one of the egalitarian \nbuilding blocks of society. (1998, 2\u20133) \nAlongside the populist theme, New Labour placed a strong emphasis on the \neconomic value of the arts\u2014in terms of tourism, jobs, and wealth creation. \nAnd New Labour has not forgotten Thatcher\u2019s emphasis on managerialism. As \nChris Smith says, \u201cI am very anxious indeed to ensure that efficient admin-\nistration becomes as valued an aspect of artistic organization as creative and \naesthetic power\u201d (1998, 21). New Labour also required that the arts make a \npositive contribution to social issues and has charged the arts and culture, \nmore generally, with the responsibility to increase social inclusion and, in \nSmith\u2019s words, \u201cto assist in the regeneration of areas of deprivation\u201d (19). \nIn 2003, ACEl wrote:\nWe are looking for a new, grown-up relationship with arts organisations; one \nthat is based on trust, not dependency. . . . We consider this new relationship to \nbe fundamentally important to the future of the subsidised arts.\nArts organisations . . . must play a leadership role in terms of artistic innovation \nand experimentation, as well as in how they are managed and governed. They \nare crucial to all our priorities and we will ask them to make a major contribu-\ntion to our ambitions in cultural diversity . . . .\nWe will be fair in what we expect of organisations. We will help provide train-\ning for their employees and we will help to produce more cultural managers \nand leaders for the future. . . .\nIn return, we expect arts organisations . . . to be well managed and to deliver \nusing our investment. (2003, 5; emphasis added)\nThe resonance of this extract with the ideals of enterprise culture, which has \nnot dissipated since Thatcher, and the consonance of ACE\u2019s choice of words \nwith business logic are hard to miss.\nIn the past, ACE provided some fellowships, bursaries, and prizes directly \nto individual artists, but it focused on making grants to organizations; con-\nsequently, most of the support that artists received reached them indirectly, \nchanneled through such organizations. Under New Labour, this continues to \n8 Vol. 29, No. 1\n The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society\nbe the case. But in 2002, ACE was significantly restructured. One result was \nan initiative to \u201cplace artists at the centre.\u201d ACE writes:\nThe artist is the \u201clife source\u201d of our work. In the past, we have mainly funded \ninstitutions. Now we want to give higher priority to the artist.\nWe can do this indirectly through training, legislative change, or in stimulating \nthe economy for artists. Or we might provide direct assistance through more \nfunding, or help with spaces to work, with equipment, time, or travel and oppor-\ntunities for international exchanges.\nWe believe artists, at times, need the chance to dream, without having to pro-\nduce. We will establish ways to spot new talent; we will find ways to help talent \ndevelop; we will encourage artists working at the cutting edge; we will encour-\nage radical thought and action, and opportunities for artists to change direction \nand find new inspiration. (2003, 4)\nThe Blair government also made changes to the National Lottery in 1998, \nadding a sixth \u201cgood cause\u201d which the lottery would support. The New \nOpportunities Fund would henceforth underwrite projects in health, educa-\ntion, and the environment. This addition meant that the arts because the arts \nwould now receive a one-sixth rather than a one-fifth share of lottery funds. \nAs lottery money is characterized as distinct from government funding, the \nchange could not be seen as a funding cut, but obviously the arts would now \nhave to compete against another priority area and would receive less money.\nThe National Lottery Act also founded a new nondepartmental pub-\nlic body, the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts \n(NESTA). NESTA\u2019s strapline is \u201cmaking innovation flourish,\u201d with a focus \non the practical application of \u201ccreative Britain\u201d in commercial settings. Its \nWeb site states: \u201cWe are the largest single endowment devoted exclusively \nto supporting talent, innovation and creativity in the UK. Our mission is to \ntransform the UK\u2019s capacity for innovation. We invest in early stage compa-\nnies, inform innovation policy and encourage a culture that helps innovation \nto flourish\u201d (2007). \nNESTA is mentioned enthusiastically in government descriptions of \nnational arts policy, but I shall now leave it aside, because, although it clearly \nmay benefit certain commercial artists who wish to start businesses, it is \nnot designed to aid fine artists. Another change under New Labour worth \nmentioning is that the National Lottery will help fund the 2012 Olympics in \nLondon, a point that I will come back to later.\nAt this point, a simple, schematic view of the current funding arrange-\nments for the visual arts in Great Britain may be useful (see figure 1). On the \nleft, we see that the Scottish Arts Council and the Arts Council of Wales are \nfunded by, and responsible to, the Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly \ngovernments, respectively. (I have ignored, for simplicity, Northern Ireland.) \nFall 2007 9\nArticle Name\nAlthough these two arts councils also receive a portion of National Lottery \nfunds, I have not included that source in this diagram.\nIn the middle of figure 1, we see that the Treasury allocates money to the \nDepartment of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), which in turn supports a \nvariety of public corporations and agencies and nondepartment public bodies. \nOf interest to the visual arts is DCMS\u2019s funding of ACE and the National \nMuseums. ACE, through its regional arts councils, supports client organiza-\ntions and artists. \nAlthough I have not mentioned the subject, local government funds the \narts in a variety of ways, and I have thus represented that source here. On the \nright-hand side, we see the National Lottery, which provides a portion of its \nincome to the Arts Councils for a variety of purposes. I have included Arts and \nBusiness as an important nonprofit organization and a regularly funded client \norganization of the ACE. There are many other partnerships between ACE and \nlocal government, development agencies, schools, and even with businesses \nthat are not represented. Arts and Business, a particularly interesting case, \nis one of the charities supported by the Prince of Wales, who also serves as \nScottish or \nWelsh \ngovernment\nFIGURE 1.

Arts and Business uses its grant-in-aid it receives from ACE to \nleverage private contributions.\nFinally, the figure includes the private sector, an increasingly importance \nsource of arts funding. According to Colin Tweedy, Chief Executive of Arts \nand Business, the private sector currently contributes about \u00a3530 million to \nthe arts each year (Arts and Business 2007). We should be cautious about \nwhat this figure means for the arts, but, at the very least, it does highlight \ngovernment requirements for plural funding. \nFunding for Individual Artists\nI would now like to turn the subject of funding of individual artists. ACE, in a \nhistoric shift, has funded individual artists as a priority area since 2002. Figures \nfrom ACE\u2019s Annual Review show that in fiscal year 2005\u20136, nearly 1,600 \nartists received individual grants, amounting to a total of \u00a38.8 million across \nEngland. The lowest grant to an individual was \u00a390, and the highest was nearly \n\u00a352,000. The median granted amount was \u00a34,700 (ACE 2006c).3 Let us take \nas an example the fabric artist Laura McCafferty. She received a grant of nearly \n\u00a310,000 to \u201cdevelop a two-year marketing strategy based on her attendance at \nprestigious shows\u201d (ACE 2007a). The funding covered her travel expenses and \nallowed her to prepare press and gallery packs to send in advance.\nTo put this in context, we can compare the support of individuals with the \nsupport of Creative Partnerships, which bring artists, artworks, and creative \nprojects into schools, with the support of Arts and Business, the nonprofit I \nhave already mentioned. Individual artists received 2.5 percent of last year\u2019s \ngrants, in financial terms. Creative Partnerships received 3.5 percent, and Arts \nand Business received 1.8 percent. The remainder of the grants are given to \ncover costs for capital expenses of special projects, to targeted opportunities \nfor organizations under managed funds, and to regularly funded bodies. \nGiven ACE\u2019s rhetoric on the importance of individual artists, there is less \nfunding available than one might think. Most funding is still indirect, with \nartists benefiting only if they work with funded organizations. Funding for \nindividual artists tends to focus on their professional development or on devel-\noping a commercial market for their products. As an artist friend commented \nto me, ACE focuses on artists with \u201cinfrastructure.\u201d Funding for individual \nartists is also short-term.\nThe Arts Council, then, continues its focus on organizations. One program, \nOwn Art, loans money interest-free for people to buy works of art. ACE \nreports that more than 2,600 customers drew on Own Art\u2019s loan scheme in \n2005\u20136 for purchases worth more than \u00a32 million. Twenty-nine percent of \ncustomers were first-time buyers of contemporary arts or crafts (ACE 2006a). \nClearly, this program benefits artists. It is worth mentioning, however, that the \nFall 2007 11\nArticle Name\nprogram is considered under the rubric of the \u201cCreative Economy,\u201d and art \ndealers, rather than artists, are its chief target. Because only artists represented \nby registered galleries can sell their works this way, the scheme highlights the \nneed for artists to have \u201cinfrastructure.\u201d\nAnother issue, one unrelated to those already mentioned, is the broad way \nthat ACE construes the term \u201cartist.\u201d Its broad definition is useful, insomuch \nas ACE must cover all artistic disciplines. However, this approach makes it \ndifficult to find information specifically on fine artists, and among these, on \nthose practicing visual arts. A recent statistical study commissioned by ACE, \nfor instance, used a \u201cmarketplace definition\u201d of artists (Jeffri and Greenblat \n1989, 10). The study, which draws on the UK Labour Force Survey, included \nonly people employed in the arts the week before the survey. Artists were \nclassified by \u201cStandard Occupational Categories.\u201d The study thereby mixed \npainters and sculptors with graphic designers and commercial artists (who all \nfall under SOC 381) and also neglected artists who were not working in the \narts in the previous week (Davies and Lindley 2003).\nIt seems to me that ACE has done a lot of good for the arts in the United \nKingdom. It sponsors a broad range of projects and organizations that do \ninteresting and exciting things. ACE support has been beneficial to a large \nnumber of artists, both directly and indirectly. For example, consider Antony \nGormley\u2019s Angel of the North, which is in Gateshead in the northeast \nof England; twenty meters high and the largest sculpture in Britain, it was \nerected in 1998 at a cost of about \u00a31 million. The National Lottery, through \nACE, provided a grant of \u00a3584,000 (ACE 2007c).\nI find it hard to criticize the projects and organizations supported by ACE. \nWhat is problematic, however, is the language that seems to be necessary when \ndescribing the arts. It is also important to consider what, or who, is left out of \nthe funding loop. For instance, ACE\u2019s description of Gormley\u2019s Angel casts that \nwork in the context of \u201chuge social problems, dereliction and dying traditional \nindustries\u201d in the northeast and states that the \u201cenormous popularity of the \nAngel of the North has helped . . . spawn direct private sector investment in the \narts\u201d (ACE 2007c). The impression left is that the overriding importance of the \nsculpture relates to its role in regional regeneration and fundraising.\nI was particularly struck by Turning Point (ACE 2006b), ACE\u2019s ten-year \nstrategy for the contemporary visual arts in England. The document reads \nlike a report from a business firm, identifying challenges and recording the \nACE\u2019s responses in terms of clear targets. In the first paragraph for the priority \narea \u201cSupport for Artists,\u201d ACE writes: \u201cBritish visual artists are world class. \nTheir power as cultural ambassadors is shown by the international demand \nand reception for their work. The work of our distinguished visual artists is \nrepresented in museums, galleries and biennales all over the world. This has \nbeen made possible by rapid growth of the commercial sector in London\u201d \n12 Vol. 29, No. 1\n The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society\n(2006b, 29). One hates to be too cynical when ACE is doing the best it can, but \nthe success of British artists might have more to do with artists\u2019 talents\u2014or a \nwhole host of other factors\u2014than with the growth of the commercial sector \nin London. \nNevertheless, the section on \u201cSupport for Artists\u201d brings up many important \nissues, such as the need for workspace, especially in expensive city centers, \nand the need for financial security. It also addresses the underrepresentation \nof disabled people and ethnic minorities among artists, a reality that brings up \nthe question of who is left out.\nHere, I would like to address the issue of censorship. Britain is a free coun-\ntry, without overt censorship of the arts. Nevertheless, the British system of \nfunding for the arts implies that certain types of works fit better than others. In \na market system, art works that match consumer desires sell better, a fact that \nmay create pressure for artists to produce such works (Galloway et al. 2002). \nSimilarly, artists who wish to garner state support must fit in with the funding \npriorities of government agencies.\nI would not go so far as to say that these realities \u201cdistort\u201d the kinds of \nart produced. All systems both constrain and enable and thereby shape artists \nand works of art, as Howard Becker argued so convincingly in his book Art \nWorlds (1982). But, as Hewison comments, \u201cThe main point at which inter-\nference occurs . . . is the sponsor\u2019s choice of what, and what not, to sponsor. \nInevitably new work, experimental work and any kind of art which challenges \nthe cultural and economic status quo finds it almost impossible to secure \nsponsorship\u201d (Hewison 1987, 126).\nBeyond Blair\u2019s Britain?\nToday, arts organizations face a number of uncertainties as to the shape \nthat state support will take in the next decade. Gordon Brown became prime \nminister in June 2007, and there may be a change of political party in the next \ngeneral election, due to be held before 2010.\nSeveral reports are in progress, the contents of which will not be avail-\nable for some months. ACE recently completed a \u201cpublic value\u201d consultation \ncalled \u201cThe Arts Debate\u201d in honor of its sixtieth anniversary. The council \ninvited people to send e-mail or join an online discussion on \u201ckey questions\u201d \nsuch as \u201cWhen should an artist receive public money?\u201d and \u201cShould members \nof the public be involved in arts funding decisions?\u201d The results of this con-\nsultation were published as this paper went to press, and the policy implica-\ntions will become clear when ACE publishes short- and long-term responses \nin 2008 (ACE 2007d). In addition, ACE also periodically reviews each of its \npolicy areas; currently, the visual arts are under review. The results of this \nreview will be published in 2008.\nFall 2007 13\nArticle Name\nThe government is also undertaking a comprehensive spending review and \nwill present a strategy document on \u201cThe Creative Economy Programme\u201d in \nJanuary 2008 (DCMS 2007). In the Spending Review of 2000, ACE received \nan extra \u00a3100 million from the Treasury (ACE 2007b). This will not be the \ncase this time. The Department of Culture, Media and Sport has warned \nfunded organizations to prepare for cuts from 2 to 7 percent (Tusa 2007), and \nACE is reportedly bracing for a cut of 5 percent (Kettle 2007). Other projec-\ntions assume a flat rate of funding, in nominal terms, which amount to cuts \nafter adjusting for inflation (Guardian Unlimited 2007).\nThe 2012 Olympics in London is causing concern in the arts world. The \nexpected costs of the games have risen higher than Mount Olympus itself, and \nsomeone has to pay. The original cost estimate of \u00a32.4 billion has risen to \u00a39.3 \nbillion (Metro 2007). London\u2019s mayor, Ken Livingston, has refused to raise \ntaxes in the capital to cover a greater share than already agreed, and that seems \nto leave only National Lottery funds or the public purse. Either way, the arts \nworld fears that money will be directed away from culture.\nUnderstanding Art and the State\nHow are we to understand the contemporary relationship between the arts \nand the state? Colin Gray argues that the process is one of commodification \nin which use value is replaced by exchange-value. He writes, the arts are \n\u201cconsidered not as objects of use (for example, providing pleasure for indi-\nviduals . . . or for provoking thought) but as commodities that can be judged \nby the same economic criteria [as] cars, clothes or any other consumer good. \nEssentially issues of aesthetic . . . worth . . . are being replaced by those of \nthe material and impersonal market-place\u201d (Gray 2000, 6). This undoubtedly \nseems to be the case. Nevertheless, it begs the question as to why commercial \nvalues are challenging aesthetic ones.\nPierre Bourdieu\u2019s (1993) analysis of fields of power provides a forceful tool \nfor understanding the contemporary situation. Bourdieu argues that modern \nsociety is made up of different fields of action within an overarching field of \npower. Within these fields, elites vie for resources\u2014political, economic, and \ncultural\u2014and for hegemony over other social classes. Further, he argues that \nin the field of the arts there are two poles: the autonomous pole is independent \nof other fields and produces \u201cpure\u201d art\u2014art for art\u2019s sake\u2014rich with cultural \ncapital, but poor with economic capital. Toward the heteronomous pole, the \narts are penetrated by the commercial sector, producing both \u201cbourgeois\u201d \nart\u2014which sells reasonably well but still has some claim to artness\u2014and \n\u201cindustrial\u201d art, which is lowbrow and produced only because it sells.\nIn my view, in the United Kingdom, we are witnessing the interpenetration \nof the autonomous pole of \u201cpure\u201d art not just by the commercial sector, but \n14 Vol. 29, No. 1\n The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society\nalso by the state and, relatedly, in the form of managerial thinking about all \naspects of contemporary life\u2014an ideology that supposes that all social issues \ncan be solved through neoliberal economic processes.\nIn the brief history covered in this article, I have provided only a rough \nsketch of how we reached this juncture, but this evolution was complex and \nit engendered much resistance, a situation predicted by Bourdieu\u2019s theory that \nfields of power involve conflict and struggle.\nTensions exist in today\u2019s ACE, many of which were institutionalized in its \nearly days\u2014but new tensions have emerged. The original tensions involved \nperceived conflicts between the goals of excellence and access, interests that \nare intrinsic to the art world. The relation of excellence to the art world needs \nno explanation; the relation of access, however, may be less apparent\u2014the \nnumber of people who view an artwork may be of less interest to the most \naesthetically pure members of the arts world. But most artists would like their \nwork to be appreciated in one way or another. \nWhat is striking about today\u2019s situation is that a number of tensions arose \nas a result of priorities imposed from elsewhere, priorities that are of no intrin-\nsic concern to the art world. I have noted only a few: the emphasis on value \nfor money in the analysis of the merits of artistic projects, the suggestion that \nthe arts should be responsible for increasing economic competitiveness and \ninspiring the creative economy, and the assumption that the arts should be an \ninstrument of social inclusiveness. These requirements contribute to broader \npolitical agendas, but not to the goals of artists or art lovers. \nACE was formed to work at arm\u2019s length from government to protect \nACE, not to mention arts organizations and artists, from political interfer-\nence from above or below. Artists were to be protected from party politics in \nmatters of artistic importance. But the tighter control of government reduced \nthis buffer. In addition, accountability to government, especially in terms of \naudience numbers, increased the pressure from below by people who wished \nthe arts to entertain or soothe, rather than challenge, them\u2014to provide them \nwith answers, rather than provoke them with questions. At its outset, the \nArts Council was relatively independent from the political sphere, and it also \nserved, in a small way, to insulate artists from the marketplace. In today\u2019s \nclimate, both independence and insulation have been attenuated, and we may, \nperhaps, expect this trend to continue.\nI would like to conclude a more hopeful note, with the Robert Hewison\u2019s \nimpassioned plea on behalf of the arts: \u201cCultural policy will play an ever \ngreater part in the national debate, for it must be understood that culture is \nthe national narrative, the ground of identity and the support of society. Such \na narrative cannot be sieved through the narrow accountancy of a sterile \nsearch for value for money. What we must argue for is money for values\u201d \n(1995, 313).\nFall 2007 15\nArticle Name\nKEYWORDS\nArts Council of England, cultural policy, state funding of the arts, United \nKingdom, visual arts \nNOTES\nThis article is a written (and shortened) version of a plenary talk given at the Conference of the \nEuropean Sociological Association (ESA), Research Network for the Sociology of the Arts, New \nFrontiers in Arts Sociology: Creativity, Support and Sustainability, L\u00fcneburg, Germany, March \n30, 2007.
