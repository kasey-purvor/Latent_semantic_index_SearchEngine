Prima facie, there are two\nplausible ways for the court to reach a decision by taking majority votes. One - the\nissue-based method - is to have the judges vote separately on each issue underlying\nthe case, and then draw the logical consequences that the legal doctrine entails in view\nof these results. The other - the case-based method - consists in collecting the judges\u2019\nvotes on the case alone, regardless of how they assess the issues. For some patterns of\nopinions, the two methods deliver opposite results. In Kornhauser and Sager\u2019s view,\nthis discrepancy constitutes a paradox because, for one, it comes as a surprise, and\nfor another, it leads to a hard choice; indeed, either method can recommend itself\non some normative grounds. Further, the paradox is doctrinal, because it jeopardizes\nthe conformity to the legal doctrine at the collective level: if the court takes polls on\nboth the issues and the case, its overall position clashes with the legal doctrine any\ntime the discrepancy occurs.\nHere is the didactic, by now celebrated, example by which Kornhauser and Sager\nillustrate their paradox. Suppose that there are three judges 1, 2 and 3, who should\ncollectively decide on a case of breach of contract. The legal doctrine, which each\njudge acknowledges, states that the defendant owes a compensation to the plaintiff\n(= c) if and only if the contract between them is valid (= a) and the defendant broke\nit (= b). Judges follow the issue-based method if they vote on a and b, and then apply\nthe biimplicative doctrine to conclude, and they follow the case-based method if they\ndirectly vote on c. Specifically, suppose that they entertain the following opinions on\na, b, c (observe that each individually obeys the legal doctrine):\na\n\u2018contract\nvalid\u2019\nb\n\u2018contract\nbroken\u2019\nc\n\u2018compensation\ndue\u2019\nthe legal\ndoctrine\nJudge 1 Y Y Y Y\nJudge 2 N Y N Y\nJudge 3 Y N N Y\nCourt, issue-based Y Y Y Y\nCourt, case-based N\nAs the table shows, the plaintiff would be compensated on one method but not on\nthe other. Since this and related examples circulated among legal theorists, they have\nbeen arguing about the merits of the two ways, sometimes taking one to be superior\nto the other, sometimes taking both to be questionable and seeking a third way of\nescape.2\n1These works are the proper references for the doctrinal paradox. The widely cited paper by\nKornhauser and Sager [17] is the first to raise the decision problems of a multi-judge court, but\nwithout yet formulating the paradox.\n2See the survey of proposed solutions in Nash [22]. Kornhauser and Sager [18] themselves favour a\n2\nFollowing the lead of Pettit [30] and List and Pettit [20], the theory of logical ag-\ngregation has encapsulated the doctrinal paradox into a complex net of impossibility\ntheorems, roughly paralleling the move in social choice theory from the Condorcet\nparadox to Arrow\u2019s theorem. However, this work had less effect on legal theory than\nthe earlier one did on political science. Neither Kornhauser and Sager nor their fol-\nlowers have paid much attention to the impossibility theorems. Though it contributes\nto the same technical corpus, the present paper is motivated by the thought that this\ncommunication failure should, if possible, be remedied.\nLogical aggregation theorists handle the doctrinal paradox in terms of a logical\nlanguage in which they express not only the propositions relative to the issues and\nthe case, but also the legal doctrine itself, and this may be a cause of dissatisfaction\nfor the legal theorists, given the complexity and elusiveness of the latter concept.\nWe will attend to this objection in our logical treatment of the doctrine, but we are\nprimarily concerned with another twist, which consists in treating all propositions,\nincluding the doctrine, on a par. The logical aggregation theorists\u2019 basic move is to\ngather all relevant propositions into a single set of logical formulas, called the agenda,\nand then attribute to each individual and the aggregate a judgment set, which is made\nout of accepted agenda formulas. Within this framework, the distinction between the\nissues and the case vanishes. The logical properties of judgment sets become the sole\nfocus of attention, and the doctrinal paradox boils down to the inconsistency in the\njudgment set resulting from majority votes:\n{a, b, c\u2194 a \u2227 b,\u00acc} .\nLegal theorists could complain that the doctrinal paradox was defined more specifi-\ncally. For them, it means the conflict between two methods of decision, or in logical\nterms, the contradiction between those two formulas - c and \u00acc - which the methods\ndeliver to resolve the case, a definition lost in the new framework.\nWe address this concern by making a limited technical modification to the existing\ntheory. We keep the judgment sets and investigate their logical properties, but sub-\ndivide the agenda X into premisses and non-premisses, a distinction that abstractly\ngeneralizes Kornhauser and Sager\u2019s between the issues and the case. We allow any\nnon-empty subset P of X, including P = X, to count as a set of premisses, provided\nit contains the negation of each of its member formulas. For the doctrinal paradox\nagenda, given by\nX = {a, b, c, c\u2194 a \u2227 b,\u00aca,\u00acb,\u00ac(c\u2194 a \u2227 b)} ,\nlegal theory would suggest taking as premisses a, b, and possibly c\u2194 a \u2227 b if a vote\nis taken on the legal doctrine, plus the negations; but we would allow for many other\nchoices of P .\nSimilarly, we abstractly generalize the distinction between issue-based and case-\nbased methods. Taking majority voting only as a special case, we define the premiss-\nbased approach by the twofold condition that the aggregative rule satisfies Indepen-\ndence (i.e., formula-wise aggregation) on P and Unanimity Preservation on P . As\nthird way, consisting for the court in voting on the method to be applied (the \"metavote\" solution).\n3\nto the conclusion-based approach, we define it by the single condition that the ag-\ngregative rule satisfies Unanimity Preservation on X\\P . In this way, the doctrinal\nparadox reduces to the following question: to what extent are the premiss-based and\nconclusion-based approaches mutually compatible? This amounts to asking to what\nextent Independence on P is compatible with Unanimity Preservation on the whole\nof X.\nAs defined here, the conclusion-based approach is sufficiently modest to be prima\nfacie agreeable to the premiss-based approach. Having left this way of escape, if\nwe eventually find that our axiomatic conditions clash, we will have extended the\ndoctrinal paradox the more significantly. This is indeed the outcome of the paper,\nand it should strike legal theorists as relevant to their own inquiry. Technically, we\nwill prove necessary and sufficient conditions on P and X for any aggregative rule\nsatisfying restricted Independence and global Unanimity Preservation to be dictato-\nrial on the premisses (Theorem 1) or, more strongly, on all formulas (Theorem 2);\nan oligarchic variant accompanies these impossibility theorems. The conditions on P\nand X, which amount to connecting the premisses logically, can be met in a number\nof different ways.\nEarlier works in logical aggregation theory have examined premiss-based and\nconclusion-based aggregative rules. But their definitions of premisses are more re-\nstrictive the present one. They superimpose one or several of the following features\nof premisses: (i) premisses obey a definite logical pattern, typically logical indepen-\ndence; (ii) premisses are fully determining, i.e., if decisions are made for or against\nall premisses, decisions result for or against all non-premisses; (iii) only one formula\n(and its negation) are not premisses, but \u2018conclusions\u2019.3 Surprisingly, none of these\nfeatures is required for our impossibility results. Some of the earlier writers have\nimpossibility results too, but use independence unrestrictedly, with the exceptions of\nDietrich [2] and Mongin [21], and also implicitly of Nehring [23].4\nIn the limiting case P = X, Theorems 1 and 2 (and their accompanying variants)\nreduce to known impossibility theorems derived under unrestricted independence,\nincluding results in the present symposium. See the detailed literature review in\nsection 5. Our proof techniques build on that earlier work. The initial version of this\npaper also strengthened the existing theory by allowing for infinite populations, but\nsince this is an orthogonal direction of generality, it eventually seemed best to pursue\nit elsewhere.5\n3Premisses have been conceptualized variously. List and Pettit [20] and Dietrich [2] assume (i);\nNehring and Puppe [26], (ii); Mongin [21] and Dokow and Holzman [11], (i) and (ii); Nehring and\nPuppe [27], (i) and (iii); and Nehring [23], all the three. Dietrich\u2019s [3] relevance-based definition may\nbe the only one without any such restrictions.\n4Dietrich and List [7] also restrict independence in their positive characterization of strategy-\nproofness.\n5Results for infinite populations are to be found in sections 4 and 5 of the preprint version (Dietrich\nand Mongin [10]).\n4\n2 A general logic framework\nA logic consists of a logical language, which defines the permissible formulas, and\nof a formal statement of logical links between these formulas. In logical aggregation\ntheory, the propositions on which the individuals and society make judgments are\nrepresented by formulas, and the acceptance of formulas should respect the logical\nlinks. Since Dietrich [4], it has become clear that the theory does not need to be\nspecific about either side of the logic, and importantly, that it is not limited to the\npropositional calculus. Recall that the language of the propositional calculus consists\nof propositional variables (which stand for the elementary propositions, like a, b, c\nin the doctrinal paradox example) and Boolean connectives (\u00ac, \u2227, \u2228, \u2192, \u2194, which\nstand for \"not\", \"and\", \"or\", \"if-then\", \"if-and-only-if\"). The general logic of this\npaper abstracts from this choice of language, as well as from the specific definition of\nlogical links in the propositional calculus.\nThe logical language L. Its formulas, designated by \u03d5,\u03c8, \u03c7..., are typically con-\nstructed from elementary formulas, to be designated by a, b, c..., and logical symbols,\namong which \u00ac must be present. Formally, all we impose on L is that for all \u03d5 \u2208 L,\n\u00ac\u03d5 \u2208 L. There may or may not be in L symbols of further Boolean connectives and\nof non-Boolean operators. In the legal context, two relevant examples of the latter\ngroup are the unary operators of deontic logic - symbolically, O, which stands for \"it\nis obligatory that\", and its dual P , which stands for \"it is permissible that\". Formally,\nO and P take any formula \u03d5 in L into another formula in L, O\u03d5 resp. P\u03d5. Unlike\n\u00ac, O and P are non-Boolean, or equivalently, not truth-functional ; that is to say,\nknowing the truth-value of \u03d5 is sufficient to fix the truth-value of \u00ac\u03d5, but not that of\nO\u03d5 or P\u03d5 (think of \"it is obligatory to pay one\u2019s taxes\" as an example of this).\nAnother relevant, this time binary, non-Boolean operator is the implication of\nconditional logic, symbolically \u03d5 \u2192\u0592 \u03c8. The difference with the so-called material\nor classical implication \u2192 is again that \u2192 is truth-functional but \u2192\u0592 is not, i.e.,\nthe truth-values of \u03d5 and \u03c8 determine that of \u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8 but not that of \u03d5 \u2192\u0592 \u03c8.\nThere are alternative ways to define \u2192\u0592, which are explored in conditional logic but\nnot reviewed here. Arguably, the legal doctrine of Kornhauser and Sager should be\nparaphrased as \"the defendant would owe a compensation to the plaintiff if and only\nif the contract between them were valid and the defendant had broken it\", or \"as a\nmatter of legal obligation, the defendant owes a compensation to the plaintiff if and\nonly if the contract between them is valid and the defendant broke it\", both analyses\nleading again into the non-classical realm.6\nThe logical links within L. They can be stated in two ways, either by defining\nan entailment relation \u22a2, or by defining a set I of inconsistent subsets of L. Since\nboth notions are technically useful, it is immaterial which is chosen as a primitive,\nprovided that the two are interdefinable. Section 7 makes the two axiomatic exercises\nin turn, expanding on Dietrich\u2019s [4] analysis. At this stage, we take inconsistency as\nbeing the primitive. Any subset I \u2286 2L satisfying the conditions (I1)-(I5) in section\n6The non-classical biimplication is of the subjunctive (or counterfactual) type in the first para-\nphrase, and of the strict (or strong) type in the second. See Lewis [33]. For an application to\njudgment aggregation, see Dietrich [5].\n5\n7 can be chosen to represent the set of inconsistent subsets. Then, derivatively, a set\nS \u2286 L entails \u03d5 \u2208 L - written S \u22a2 \u03d5 - if S \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5} \u2208 I; and \u03d5 is a logical truth if\n{\u00ac\u03d5} \u2208 I, a contradiction if {\u03d5} \u2208 I, and a contingent formula if neither holds. The\nentailment relation automatically satisfies the conditions (E1)-(E6) of section 7. For\nlater technical purposes, we define S \u2286 L to be minimally inconsistent if S \u2208 I and\nfor all T \u0001 S, T \u000f\u2208 I.\nThe agenda and the judgment sets. The agenda represents the propositions on\nwhich judgments are passed, at both the individual and collective level. Formally, it\nis any non-empty subset X \u2286 L that contains only contingent formulas and takes the\nform of a union of pairs {\u03d5,\u00ac\u03d5}, where \u03d5 does not begin with \u00ac. From now on, when\nwe write \"\u00ac\u03c8\" with \u03c8 \u2208 X, we mean the other element of the pair to which \u03c8 belongs.\nFor any S \u2286 X, we put S\u00b1 = {\u03d5,\u00ac\u03d5 : \u03d5 \u2208 S} and define S to be negation-closed\nif S = S\u00b1. A subagenda of X is any non-empty and negation-closed subset P \u2286 X.\nA judgment set is a set B \u2286 X of formulas representing the propositions accepted\nby an individual or the collectivity. It is complete with respect to S \u2286 X if for all\n\u03d5 \u2208 S, \u03d5 \u2208 B or \u00ac\u03d5 \u2208 B, and deductively closed with respect to S if for all \u03d5 \u2208 S, it\nfollows from B \u22a2 \u03d5 that \u03d5 \u2208 B. When S = X, we just call B complete (respectively,\ndeductively closed).\nIf a consistent judgment set is complete, then from the conditions of section 7, it\nis also deductively closed, while the converse does not hold. Accordingly, we define\nD to be the set of all judgment sets that are consistent and complete, and D\u2217 \u2283 D\nto be the set of all judgment sets that are consistent and deductively closed.\nWe consider a set of individuals N of any cardinality |N | \u2265 2 (the group in\nquestion), and define a social judgment function as a mapping\nF : DN \u2192 2X ,\nwith DN \u2192 D and DN \u2192 D\u2217 as particular cases. Here, DN is the (unrestricted)\ndomain of all possible profiles (Ai)i\u2208N of judgment sets across the group. Our main\ntheorem assumes N to be finite, but most of our preparatory lemmas are stated\nwithout this restriction.\n3 The axioms on social judgment functions\nWe represent the propositions singled out as premisses in terms of any fixed subagenda\nP \u2286 X, with the letters p, q, r,... to denote its elements. Now, consider the following\ntwo axioms:\nIndependence on P . For all p \u2208 P and all (Ai)i\u2208N , (A\n\u2217\ni )i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN , if for all\ni \u2208 N , p \u2208 Ai \u21d4 p \u2208 A\n\u2217\ni , then\np \u2208 F ((Ai)i\u2208N)\u21d4 p \u2208 F ((A\n\u2217\ni )i\u2208N).\nIn words, aggregation takes place formula by formula on P .\nUnanimity Preservation. For all \u03d5 \u2208 X and all (Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN , if for all i \u2208 N ,\n\u03d5 \u2208 Ai, then \u03d5 \u2208 F ((Ai)i\u2208N).\n6\nBy definition, any F satisfying both Independence on P and Unanimity Preser-\nvation also restricted to P belongs to the premiss-based approach, and any F sat-\nisfying Unanimity Preservation restricted to X\\P belongs to the conclusion-based\napproach. To illustrate the two approaches, consider premiss-based majority voting\nFPBM and conclusion-based majority voting FCBM , respectively. Given N of finite\ncardinality, for every profile (Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN , we define FPBM((Ai)i\u2208N) by first taking\nPmaj = {p \u2208 P : |{i : p \u2208 Ai}| > |N |\/2}, and then putting\nFPBM((Ai)i\u2208N) = Pmaj \u222a {\u03d5 \u2208 X\\P : Pmaj \u22a2 \u03d5}.\nThe judgment sets generated by FPBM are in D\n\u2217 if P has no minimal inconsistent\nsubset Y with |Y | \u2265 3 and |N | is odd. As to FCBM , given N of finite cardinality, it\nis defined by putting\nPCBM((Ai)i\u2208N) = {\u03d5 \u2208 X\\P : |{i : \u03d5 \u2208 Ai}| > |N |\/2}\nfor every profile (Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN .\nThe premiss-based approach excludes constant social judgment functions, but\nallows for oligarchy and dictatorship. Define F to be an oligarchy on P if there\nis a non-empty M \u2286 N - the oligarchs on P - such that, for all (Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN ,\nF ((Ai)i\u2208N)\u2229P = \u2229i\u2208M(Ai\u2229P ), and to be a dictatorship on P if F is an oligarchy on\nP with M = {i} for some i, the dictator on P . Dictatorship and oligarchy simpliciter\nrefer to the whole of X. Generally, any condition or rule that does not mention a set\nis meant to refer to X.7\nWhether a social judgment function for finite N degenerates into dictatorship\nor oligarchy on P when satisfying Independence on P and Unanimity Preservation\ndepends on how the premisses are logically connected, both with each other and with\nformulas inX\\P . We introduce the three conditions that section 4 demonstrates to be\npivotal. The last one requires an auxiliary notion: for any \u03d5, \u03c8 \u2208 X, \u03d5 conditionally\nentails \u03c8 - symbolically, \u03d5 \u22a2\u2217 \u03c8 - if there is a (possibly empty) set Y \u2286 X such that\nY \u222a{\u03d5} \u22a2 \u03c8 and both Y \u222a{\u03d5} and Y \u222a {\u00ac\u03c8} are consistent.8 The shorthand Y\u00acZ\ndenotes (Y \\Z)\u222a{\u00ac\u03d5 : \u03d5 \u2208 Z}, i.e., the set obtained from Y by negating the formulas\nof one of its subsets Z.\nCONDITIONS ON PREMISSES:\n(a) There is a minimal inconsistent set Y \u2286 X such that |Y \u2229 P | \u2265 3.\n(b) There is a minimal inconsistent set Y \u2286 X such that Y\u00acZ is consistent for\nsome set Z \u2286 Y \u2229 P of even cardinality.\n(c) For all p, q \u2208 P , there is a sequence p1, ..., pk \u2208 P (k \u2265 2) such that p = p1 \u22a2\n\u2217\np2 \u22a2\n\u2217 ... \u22a2\u2217 pk = q.\n7Oligarchy here obeys the definition of Dietrich and List [8] or Dokow and Holzman [13]. G\u00e4rden-\nfors [14], Nehring [24], Nehring and Puppe [26] and Dokow and Holzman [11] have different notions.\n8Using that our logic is compact (see section 7), the conditional entailment \u03d5 \u22a2\u2217 \u00ac\u03c8 can equiv-\nalently be defined by the property that \u03d5 \u0003= \u00ac\u03c8 and that there exists a minimal inconsistent set\nY \u2032 \u2286 X containing both \u03d5 and \u00ac\u03c8.\n7\nIn the statement of (b), \u2018of even cardinality\u2019 can be changed into \u2018of cardinality\ntwo\u2019; the equivalence is shown in the proof of Lemma 3 in section 8.\nThese conditions parallel existing ones (as discussed in section 5), but unconven-\ntionally refer to P . The connections stated by (a), (b), (c) can either take place inside\nor outside P . At one extreme, there can be none in terms of P alone, except for the\ntrivial ones between p and \u00acp; then, the inconsistent sets Y of (a) and (b) necessarily\ncontain non-premisses, and similarly with the sets Y1, ..., Yk supporting conditional\nentailments in (c). Such is the case when the premisses are logically independent,\nand in particular when they are the literals of the propositional calculus (the liter-\nals are the propositional variables and their negations). For another example, take\nX = {a, a \u2192 b, b}\u00b1 and P = {a, a \u2192 b}\u00b1. Although the members of P are not\nlogically independent, they typically become so if a non-classical a \u2192\u0592 b replaces the\nmaterial a \u2192 b. Indeed, most axiomatizations in conditional logic make the truth-\nvalues of a and a \u2192\u0592 b independent of each other; emphatically, the truth of the\nimplication cannot be concluded anymore from the falsity of its antecedent. At the\nother extreme, all relevant interconnections trivially take place within P if P = X.\nThough substantial, the list does not seem exaggeratedly demanding. Condition\n(a) is flexible. If, e.g., P = {a, b, c}\u00b1, it can be met by taking X to contain one of\na \u2228 b \u2228 c, (a \u2192 (b \u2192 c)), (a \u2194 (b \u2194 c)), or still other formulas. Condition (c) can\nbe met with highly roundabout connections, and (b) may be the easiest to satisfy.\nIf, e.g., X = {a, b, a \u2227 b}\u00b1 and P = {a, b}\u00b1, (b) holds with Y = {a, b,\u00ac(a \u2227 b)} and\nZ = {a, b}, whereas (a) and (c) fail.\n4 Main results\nTo get an idea of how logical interconnections narrow down the set of possible social\njudgment functions, observe how FPBM can violate Unanimity Preservation. Take\nthe doctrinal paradox agenda with X = {a, b, c\u2194 a \u2227 b, c}\u00b1, and unconventionally,\nlet P = {a, b, c}\u00b1. If (Ai)i\u2208N is the profile of the introduction, all individuals accept\nthe non-premiss c\u2194 a \u2227 b, and yet\nFPBM((Ai)i\u2208N) = {a, b,\u00acc,\u00ac(c\u2194 a \u2227 b)}.\nThe following theorem encompasses this and many other troubling examples. Its\nconclusions vary in strength with the requirement placed on collective judgment sets.\nTheorem 1. Suppose that N is finite with |N | \u2265 3. Then, if (a), (b) and (c)\nhold, every social judgment function F : DN \u2192 D\u2217 (resp. D) that is independent\non P and unanimity-preserving is an oligarchy (resp. a dictatorship) on P , and the\nconverse implication also holds.\nAs the proof makes clear, the direct statement also holds for |N | = 2, but the\ncounterexamples to establish the converse take at least |N | = 3. This proof is subdi-\nvided into nine lemmas reported in this section and proved in section 8. Some make\nuse of two further properties of social judgment functions that need now introducing.\n8\nSystematicity on P . For all p, p\u2217 \u2208 P and all (Ai)i\u2208N , (A\n\u2217\ni )i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN , if for all\ni \u2208 N , p \u2208 Ai \u21d4 p\n\u2217 \u2208 A\u2217i , then\np \u2208 F ((Ai)i\u2208N)\u21d4 p\n\u2217 \u2208 F ((A\u2217i )i\u2208N).\nMonotonicity on P . For all p \u2208 P and all (Ai)i\u2208N , (A\n\u2217\ni )i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN , if for all\ni \u2208 N , p \u2208 Ai \u21d2 p \u2208 A\n\u2217\ni , and for some j \u2208 N , p \/\u2208 Aj and p \u2208 A\n\u2217\nj , then\np \u2208 F ((Ai)i\u2208N)\u21d2 p \u2208 F ((A\n\u2217\ni )i\u2208N).\nBy itself, the proof of Theorem 1 brings to light three more results holding un-\nder the previous cardinality restrictions on N . These are variants, not corollaries of\nthe theorem, because they involve both weaker assumptions and weaker conclusions.\nBriefly put, Systematicity on P makes it possible to dispense with condition (c), and\nMonotonicity on P with condition (b). Technically:\n(i) If and only if (a) and (b) hold, every social judgment function F : DN \u2192 D\u2217\n(resp. D) that is systematic on P and unanimity-preserving is an oligarchy (resp. a\ndictatorship) on P ;\n(ii) If and only (a) holds, every social judgment function F : DN \u2192 D (resp. D\u2217)\nthat is systematic on P , monotonic on P , and unanimity-preserving, is an oligarchy\n(resp. a dictatorship) on P ;\n(iii) If and only if (a) and (c) hold, every social judgment function F : DN \u2192 D\u2217\n(resp. D) that is independent on P , monotonic on P , and unanimity-preserving is an\noligarchy (resp. a dictatorship) on P .\nThe lemmas use the classic set-theoretic language of filters and ultrafilters that\nlogical aggregation theorists have borrowed from social choice theory. None of the\ninvolved notions require N to be finite, which is precisely the reason why they were\nfirst introduced. The finiteness assumption is made only in Lemma 5 to secure the\nfamiliar steps from filters to oligarchies, and ultrafilters to dictatorships.\nFor concreteness, we refer to subsets C \u2286 N as coalitions. Now, a set of coalitions\nD \u2286 2N is superset-closed if for all coalitions C,C\u2217, C \u2208 D and C \u2286 C\u2217 \u2286 N imply\nC\u2217 \u2208 D; intersection-closed if for all coalitions C,C\u2217, C,C\u2217 \u2208 D \u21d2 C \u2229 C\u2217 \u2208 D;\ncomplete if for all coalitions C, C \/\u2208 D \u21d2 N\\C \u2208 D; a filter if D is superset-\nclosed and intersection-closed, with \u2205 \/\u2208 D.9 Finally, an ultrafilter is a filter that is\ncomplete.10\nFor any social judgment function F : DN \u2192 2X , let us say that D \u2286 2N generates\nF on p \u2208 P if\n(\u2217) \u2200(Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN , p \u2208 F ((Ai)i\u2208N)\u21d4 {i : p \u2208 Ai} \u2208 D.\nWe then denote D by CFp . This functional notation makes sense because there can\nbe at most one such D. If moreover the same D generates F on every p \u2208 P , we\n9Filters are sometimes defined without requiring \u2205 \/\u2208 D, in which case our filters become the proper\nfilters. See Chang and Keisler [1, p. 164].\n10Or, equivalently, a filter that is maximal for set inclusion.\n9\nsay that D generates F on P and denote it by CF . For concreteness again, we call\nthe members of CF (F -)winning coalitions (on P ). When there is no ambiguity, we\nmay drop reference to F , writing Cp for C\nF\np and C for C\nF . To illustrate, suppose\nthat F is an oligarchy on P with a set of oligarchs M \u2286 N ; then, F is generated by\nCF = {C \u2286 N : C \u2286M}.\nLemma 1. A social judgment function F : DN \u2192 2X is (i) independent on P if\nand only if for every p \u2208 P , there is CFp \u2286 2\nN generating F on p, and (ii) systematic\non P if and only if there is CF \u2286 2N generating F on P .\nAn example of a social judgment function that is independent on P , but not\nsystematic on P , is the constant rule F ((Ai)i\u2208N) = A, for any fixed A \u2286 X. Here,\nCFp = 2\nN if p \u2208 A and CFp = \u2205 if p \/\u2208 A.\nLemma 2. Let a social judgment function F : DN \u2192 D\u2217 be independent on P .\nThen, for all p \u2208 P and all C \u2286 N , if C \u2208 CFp , then N\\C \/\u2208 C\nF\n\u00acp, and if moreover\nF : DN \u2192 D, the converse implication holds. Also, N \u2208 CFp and \u2205 \/\u2208 C\nF\np if F is\nunanimity-preserving.\nLemma 3. Assume (b). Then, if a social judgment function F : DN \u2192 D\u2217 is\nsystematic on P and unanimity-preserving, CF is superset-closed.\nLemma 4. Assume (a) and (b). Then, if a social judgment function F :DN \u2192 D\u2217\nis systematic on P and unanimity-preserving, CF is intersection-closed.\nLemma 5. Assume (a) and (b). Then, if a social judgment function F : DN \u2192\nD\u2217 (resp. D) is systematic on P and unanimity-preserving, CF is a filter (resp.\nultrafilter), and for finite N , F is an oligarchy (resp. dictatorship) on P .\nThis implies one direction of Theorem 1 via a last lemma.\nLemma 6. If a social judgment function F : DN \u2192 D\u2217 is independent on P and\nunanimity-preserving, then for all p, q \u2208 P , p \u22a2\u2217 q \u21d2 Cp \u2286 Cq; and if (c) also holds,\nF is systematic on P .\nAs to the variants of Theorem 1, the sufficiency part in (i) is already proved at\nthe stage of Lemma 5, while those in (ii) and (iii) follow from adapting Lemmas 4\nand 5 slightly.11\nThe other direction of Theorem 1 follows from the next three lemmas, using the\nfact that an oligarchy (hence also a dictatorship) on P is necessarily generated on P\nby a filter CF .\n11That F is monotonic on P should replace (b) in Lemmas 4 and 5. Inspection of the proofs shows\nthat they carry through.\n10\nLemma 7. If |N | \u2265 3 and (a) is violated, a social judgment function F : DN \u2192 D\nexists that is systematic (hence independent) on P and unanimity-preserving, and\nsuch that CF is not a filter.\nLemma 8. If |N | \u2265 3 and (b) is violated, a social judgment function F : DN \u2192 D\nexists that is systematic (hence, independent) on P and unanimity-preserving, and\nsuch that CF is not a filter.\nLemma 9. If (c) is violated, a social judgment function F : DN \u2192 D exists that\nis independent on P and unanimity-preserving, and such that CFp is not the same for\nall p \u2208 P .\n5 Applications and connections with the literature\nIn this section, we consider special sets P for which the results of the previous section\nare simplified, and by this process obtain earlier theorems as corollaries; this leads us\nto discuss the extant literature. We also illustrate the premiss-based approach with\nexamples of P that are relevant to legal theory and beyond.\nFirst, suppose that P = X. Then, Independence on P becomes (standard) In-\ndependence; (c) becomes total blockedness (introduced by Nehring and Puppe [25],\nlater adopted by Dokow and Holzman [12] and others); (b) becomes even-number-\nnegatability (Dietrich [4]), which is equivalent to non-affineness for finite X (Dokow\nand Holzman [12]); finally, (a) can be dropped as it follows from total blockedness.\nAs a corollary of Theorem 1, we obtain a by now classic result:\nCorollary 1. Suppose N is finite and |N | \u2265 3. If the agenda is even-number-\nnegatable and totally blocked, every independent and unanimity-preserving social\njudgment function F : DN \u2192 D\u2217 (resp. D) is an oligarchy (resp. a dictatorship),\nand the converse implication also holds.\nConcerning the dictatorial agenda, see Dokow and Holzman [12] for the full charac-\nterization, and Dietrich and List [6] for the sufficiency part. Concerning the oligarchic\nagenda, see the characterizations in Dietrich and List [8] and Dokow and Holzman\n[13]. The three variants of Theorem 1 based on Systematicity and\/or Monotonic-\nity imply corresponding variants of Corollary 1, which are also known; see Nehring\nand Puppe [25, 28] for the two Monotonicity-based dictatorship variants, which were\nthe first to be discovered. Some of the results we recover were originally proved for\na finite X, a restriction that we avoid by occasionally drawing on the compactness\nassumption of section 7.\nBy contrast, Theorem 1 has no direct bearing on those impossibility results which\ndo not have Unanimity Preservation among their stated conditions.12 Nor does it\ngeneralize oligarchy results based on other oligarchy notions, as referenced in fn. 7.\n12As in List and Pettit [20], Dietrich [2, 4], Pauly and van Hees [29], van Hees [34], Dietrich and\nList [6, 9].\n11\nTheorem 1 provides representations of the social judgment function that are lim-\nited to P . When does the local dictatorship result translate into a global one? Here\nis the relevant condition:\n(d) For all S \u2286 P that are consistent and complete with respect to P , and all\n\u03d5 \u2208 X, either S \u22a2 \u03d5 or S \u22a2 \u00ac\u03d5.\nIn view of the logical conditions of section 7, it is equivalent to require that for\nall B \u2208 D,\nB = {\u03d5 \u2208 X|B \u2229 P \u22a2 \u03d5} .\nIn words, any complete and consistent judgment set can be recovered from its pre-\nmisses by entailment.13 The following theorem gives necessary and sufficient condi-\ntions for global dictatorship.\nTheorem 2. Suppose N is finite and |N | \u2265 3. If (a), (b), (c) and (d) hold, every\nsocial judgment function F : DN \u2192 D that is independent on P and unanimity-\npreserving is a dictatorship, and the converse implication also holds.\nTo derive the two directions of Theorem 2 from the corresponding ones in Theorem\n1, we draw on two more lemmas.\nLemma 10. Assume (d) holds. If a social judgment function F : DN \u2192 D is a\ndictatorship on P , it is a dictatorship.\nLemma 11. Let N be finite. If (d) is violated, a social judgment function\nF : DN \u2192 D exists that is systematic (hence independent) on P and unanimity-\npreserving, but is not a dictatorship.\nA fully determining set of premisses P , in the sense of (d), should be seen as\nexceptional, which reduces the impossibility flavour of Theorem 2 and its variants\n(they can be devised after those of Theorem 1). With the doctrinal paradox agenda\nX = {a, b, c \u2194 a \u2227 b, c}\u00b1, (d) is met with P = {a, b, c \u2194 a \u2227 b}\u00b1, but not with\nP = {a, b}\u00b1. The latter choice of P is not implausible on legal grounds, because\na court that would adopt it could adjust its position on the legal doctrine to the\npositions it takes on a, b, and c.14 This facilitates compatibility with premiss-based\nmajority voting, but at the cost of wrecking full determination. However, even the\nlarger and more conventional P does not fully determine X if the material \u2194 gives\nway to a non-classical \u2190\u0593 \u2192\u0592, as in our preferred reconstruction of the legal doctrine.\n(Take the set S = {\u00aca, b,\u00ac(c \u2190\u0593 \u2192\u0592 a \u2227 b)}; it entails neither c nor \u00acc.)\nFor the sake of generality, we may consider a partly determining P , as defined\nby an existential variant (d\u2019) of (d) (i.e., with \"some S \u2286 P\" replacing \"all S \u2286\nP\"). A profile dictator for some (Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN is an individual j such that Aj =\n13Condition (d) or related ones are also considered by Dietrich [2], Nehring and Puppe [26, 27],\nand Dokow and Holzman [11].\n14That judges revise their conception of the doctrine in view of the case is a possibility essential\nto the British and US common law.\n12\nF ((Ai)i\u2208N). Even for finite N , if (a)-(c) and (d\u2019) hold, F meeting the conditions need\nnot be a dictatorship on the full domain DN , though it is a profile dictatorship for all\n(Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN such that Aj \u2229P entails every non-premiss or its negation, where j is\nthe dictator on P (who exists by Theorem 1). For instance, if P = {a, c, c\u2194 a\u2227 b}\u00b1,\na case where (d) fails but (d\u2019) holds, the individual j is a profile dictator for those\n(Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN with Aj = {a, c, c\u2194 a \u2227 b, ...}, but not for those (Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN with\nAj = {\u00aca,\u00acc, c\u2194 a \u2227 b, ...}.\nAt the other extreme of the mainstream literature, Mongin [21] specializes in a\nvery small set of premisses, defining P to be the set of literals of X \u2286 L, where\nL is the language of standard propositional logic. Using properties of the inference\nrule of propositional logic, he shows that Independence on P , with P so defined,\nleads to dictatorship in the presence of Unanimity Preservation. This result can\nalso be obtained from Theorem 2, because its stated agenda conditions entail the\npresent conditions (a), (b), (c) and (d). Technically, Mongin assumes (a), a condition\namounting to (b), given that even-number and binary negatability are equivalent\n(see section 3), (c), and Closure under Propositional Variables, which is essentially\nequivalent to (d) given his choice of logic. According to the last condition, P should\ncontain the propositional variables a \u2208 L that occur in any formula \u03d5 \u2208 X.15\nWe end up this section with sets of premisses that are specially relevant to appli-\ncations in legal theory and politics; they will also illustrate the possibility side of our\nresults. Starting from a propositional conditional logic, take X and P such that X\\P\ncontains only literals; these will represent the decision- or policy-oriented propositions\n(such as \"the defendant owes a compensation to the plaintiff\", since this commits the\ncourt to implement an action, unlike \"the contract was broken\"). Suppose further\nthat P contains only formulas of the following types:\n1. Literals representing the factual and prescriptive reasons for or against the\ndecisions.\n2. Non-classical implications p \u2192\u0592 \u03d5, or negations thereof, with p belonging to\ntype-1 premisses or the Boolean expressions built from them, and \u03d5 belonging\nto the non-premisses or the Boolean expressions built from them.\nIn many conditional logics, with negated type 2 premisses, nothing can be inferred\non non-premisses, and thus some judgment sets will not state anything on the deci-\nsions to be taken. This already shows that (d) does not hold, hence from Theorem\n2 that there exist non-dictatorial social judgment functions among those which are\nindependent on P and unanimity-preserving. Condition (c) does not hold either,\nbecause - at least in various conditional logics - negated type-2 premisses entail no\npremisses other than negated type-2 premisses. Thus, from Theorem 1, there exist\nsocial judgment functions that are well-behaved even on P .\nBy contrast, conditions (a) and (b) can easily be met, so that the first two variants\nof Theorem 1 still apply. Suppose that a, b, a \u2227 \u00acb \u2192\u0592 \u03d5 \u2208 P , where {a,\u00acb} is\nconsistent, and \u03d5 \u2208 X\\P . Then, (a) and (b) hold with Y = {a,\u00acb, a \u2227 \u00acb \u2192\u0592 \u03d5,\u00ac\u03d5}\nand Z = {a,\u00acb}, so the first two variants of Theorem 1 predict that plausible rules\n15By the propositional calculus, Closure under Propositional Variables entails (d), and if its de-\nfinition is slightly weakend, with \"occur\" being replaced by \"occur essentially\", the two become\nequivalent (as an example, a does not essentially occur in b \u2227 (a \u2228 \u00aca)).\n13\nsuch as premiss-based majority voting will degenerate. As this argument shows, the\ndoctrinal paradox is tenacious.\n6 Conclusion\nStarting afresh from Kornhauser and Sager\u2019s legal analysis, we have tried to remain\nmore faithful to it than logical aggregation theory has usually been. Because they\ndefine the doctrinal paradox as a conflict between the issue-based and case-based\nmethods of court decisions, the theory cannot claim to pursue it in the same sense\nunless it formalizes a related distinction. In responding to this problem, our defi-\nnitions of the premiss-based and conclusion-based approaches led us to restate the\ndoctrinal paradox as a tension between two axioms put on a social aggregation func-\ntion, Independence on premisses and Unanimity Preservation on both premisses and\nnon-premisses. Theorems 1 and 2, along with their variants, demonstrate that all\nfunctions satisfying the two axioms degenerate into dictatorships or oligarchies, ei-\nther local or global, under moderately demanding conditions put on the agenda and\nthe set of premisses. Viewed in this light, the doctrinal paradox appears to be a deep\nobstacle to the formation of collective judgments.\n7 The general logic\nThis section states the general logic under which our results are proved.16 Most actual\nlogics, whether classical or not, satisfy the conditions below. The major exceptions\nare the recently developed non-monotonic logics, which mean to capture inductive,\nrather than deductive, reasoning, and are out of scope here, and the paraconsistent\nlogics, which are deductive and call for an explanation below.\nOne way of capturing the general logic is by axiomatizing logical inconsistency, or\nmore precisely, a set I of subsets S \u2286 L that are intended to represent the inconsistent\nsets of formulas:\n(I1) \u2205 \/\u2208 I (non-triviality).\n(I2) For all \u03d5 \u2208 L, {\u03d5,\u00ac\u03d5} \u2208 I (reflexivity).\n(I3) For all S \u2286 L and all \u03d5 \u2208 L, if S \u000f\u2208 I, either S \u222a {\u03d5} \u000f\u2208 I or S \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5} \u000f\u2208 I\n(one-step completability).\n(I4) For all S \u2286 S\u2032 \u2286 L, if S \u2208 I, then S\u2032 \u2208 I (monotonicity).\n(I5) For all S \u2286 L, if S \u2208 I, there is a finite S0 \u2286 S such that S0 \u2208 I (compact-\nness).\nGiven (I4) and (I5), (I3) implies the following stronger property.\n(I3+) For all S \u2286 L, if S \/\u2208 I, there is T \u2286 L such that S \u2286 T , T \/\u2208 I, and T\ncontains a member of each pair \u03d5,\u00ac\u03d5 \u2208 L (completability).\n16The general logic of this section is equivalent to Dietrich\u2019s [4] one, but improves on its axioma-\ntization by formulating and making extensive use of the new condition of one-step completability -\ni.e., (I3) and (E3) below.\n14\nProposition 1 If (I3)-(I5) hold, so does (I3+).\nProof. Take a consistent set S \u2286 L. Let T be the set of all consistent sets T \u2286 L\nwhich include S; it is partially ordered by set-inclusion \u2286.\nClaim 1. Every chain T \u2217 \u2286 T (i.e., every linearly ordered subset of T ) has an\nupper bound in T .\nLet T \u2217 \u2286 T be a chain. We show that \u222aT\u2208T \u2217T is an upper bound of T\n\u2217 in T\nby establishing that this set is consistent. If not, by compactness, it has a finite\ninconsistent subset U . By finiteness, U \u2286 T for some T \u2208 T \u2217, which contradicts\nmonotonicity.\nFrom Claim 1 and Zorn\u2019s Lemma, T has a maximal element; call it T .\nClaim 2. T contains a member of each pair \u03d5,\u00ac\u03d5 \u2208 L.\nIf not, there is \u03d5 \u2208 L such that \u03d5,\u00ac\u03d5 \u000f\u2208 T . Then, by one-step completability,\neither T \u222a {\u03d5} or T \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5} is consistent. This contradicts the maximality of T . \u0001\nThis proof follows the style of existing ones to establish Lindenbaum\u2019s Lemma, a\nbasic result in logic (see, e.g., Chiang and Keisler [1, p. 10]).\nWith inconsistency defined as the primitive notion, logical entailment becomes a\nderivative one. Formally, entailment is a binary relation \u22a2 holding between sets S \u2286\nL and formulas \u03d5 \u2208 L and given by:\n(*) S \u22a2 \u03d5 if and only if S \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5} \u2208 I.\nIn the sequel, \u2018\u03c8 \u22a2 \u03d5\u2019 is short for \u2018{\u03c8} \u22a2 \u03d5\u2019.\nBy analogy with (I1)-(I6), the following conditions can be devised on logical en-\ntailment:\n(E1) There is no \u03d5 \u2208 L such that \u2205 \u22a2 \u03d5 and \u2205 \u22a2 \u00ac\u03d5 (non-triviality).\n(E2) For all \u03d5 \u2208 L, \u03d5 \u22a2 \u03d5 (reflexivity).\n(E3) For all S \u2286 L and all \u03d5, \u03c8 \u2208 L, if S \u000f\u22a2 \u03c8, then S \u222a {\u03d5} \u000f\u22a2 \u03c8 or S \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5} \u000f\u22a2 \u03c8\n(one-step completability).\n(E4) For all S \u2286 S\u2032 \u2286 L and all \u03d5 \u2208 L, if S \u22a2 \u03d5, then S\u2032 \u22a2 \u03d5 (monotonicity).\n(E5) For all S \u2286 L and all \u03d5 \u2208 L, if S \u22a2 \u03d5, there is a finite subset S0 \u2286 S such\nthat S0 \u22a2 \u03d5 (compactness).\nHere is another condition on \u22a2, which has no previous analogue on the side of I:\n(E6) For all S \u2286 L, if there is a \u03d5 \u2208 L such that S \u22a2 \u03d5 and S \u22a2 \u00ac\u03d5, then for all\n\u03d5 \u2208 L, S \u22a2 \u03d5 (non-paraconsistency).\nAs a matter of definition, the paraconsistent logics are those which do not satisfy (E6).\nWhat they accomplish in effect is to weaken the ordinary notion of a contradiction;\nthis is further explained below.\nProposition 2 If I satisfies (I1)-(I5) and \u22a2 is defined by (*), then \u22a2 satisfies (E1)-\n(E6).\n15\nSketch of the proof. (E1) derives from (I1), (I3) and (*); (E2) from (L2) and (*);\n(E3) from (I3) and (*); (E4) from (I4) and (*); and (E5) from (I4), (I5) and (*). As\nto (E6), suppose that there is \u03c8 such that S \u22a2 \u03c8 and S \u22a2 \u00ac\u03c8. From (*), S\u222a{\u00ac\u03c8} \u2208 I\nand S \u222a {\u00ac\u00ac\u03c8} \u2208 I, so that S \u2208 I by (I3). For any \u03d5, (I4) implies that S \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5}\n\u2208 I, hence that S \u22a2 \u03d5 by another application of (*). \u0001\nTo present framework is reversible, i.e., one can take \u22a2 to be the primitive notion,\nand I to be the derivative one. Prima facie, there are (at least) two plausible ways\nto define I in terms of \u22a2:\n(**) S \u2208 I if and only if for all \u03d5 \u2208 L, S \u22a2 \u03d5,\n(***) S \u2208 I if and only if there is \u03d5 \u2208 L such that S \u22a2 \u03d5 and S \u22a2 \u00ac\u03d5,\nand either way has its problems. The former may be too weak in the right to left\ndirection of the proposed equivalence, whereas the latter may be too weak in the\nleft to right direction; this suggests that neither might be sufficiently assertive. We\nby-pass this problem by assuming (E6), i.e., non-paraconsistency, which ensures that\n(**) and (***) can be used interchangeably to characterize I.\nProposition 3 If \u22a2 satisfies (E1)-(E6) and I is defined by (**) or, equivalently,\n(***), then I satisfies (I1)-(I5).\nSketch of the proof. (I1) derives from (E1) and (***); (I2) from (E2), (E4) and\n(***); (I3) from (E3) and (**); (I4) and (I5) from (E4) and (E5), respectively, and\neither (**) or (***). By (E6), both definitions can be used. \u0001\nMoreover, uniqueness holds in the following sense: the inconsistent sets con-\nstructed from an entailment relation lead back to the same relation, and the other\nway round. This is what makes the order of priority indifferent. Formally:\nProposition 4 (a) If \u22a2 is defined from I in the first place, with I satisfying (I3)\nand (I4), and I \u2032 is defined from the obtained \u22a2, then I = I \u2032.\n(b) If I is defined from \u22a2 in the first place, with \u22a2 satisfying (E2), (E3), (E4) and\n(E6), and \u22a2\u2032 is defined from the obtained I, then \u22a2 = \u22a2\u2032.\nProof. (a) Starting from I satisfying (I3) and (I4), we define \u22a2 by (*). To define\nI \u2032, we can choose either (**) or (***), given that (E6) obtains on \u22a2, and we take the\nformer. Now, suppose S \u2208 I. Then, (I4) entails that for all \u03d5, S \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5} \u2208 I, and (*)\nthat for all \u03d5, S \u22a2 \u03d5, which leads to S \u2208 I \u2032 by (**). Conversely, suppose S \u2208 I \u2032 and\napply (**). Then, for all \u03d5, S \u22a2 \u03d5 and S \u22a2 \u00ac\u03d5, whence by (*) for all \u03d5, S \u222a{\u00ac\u03d5} \u2208 I\nand S \u222a {\u00ac\u00ac\u03d5} \u2208 I, and S \u2208 I follows by (I3).\n(b) In the other direction, we start from \u22a2 satisfying (E2), (E3), (E4) and (E6),\nand having the choice between (**) or (***) to define I, we take the former. We\ndefine \u22a2\u2032 by (*). Now, suppose S \u22a2 \u03d5; then, from (E4), S \u222a{\u00ac\u03d5} \u22a2 \u03d5, and since (E2)\nand (E4) entail that S \u222a{\u00ac\u03d5} \u22a2 \u00ac\u03d5, (E6) can be invoked to get S \u222a{\u00ac\u03d5} \u2208 I, hence\nS \u22a2\u2032 \u03d5 from (*). Conversely, suppose S \u22a2\u2032 \u03d5 and apply (*) to get S \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5} \u2208 I. By\n(**), S \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5} \u22a2 \u03d5. Since S \u222a {\u03d5} \u22a2 \u03d5 holds because of (E2) and (E4), S \u22a2 \u03d5 holds\nbecause of (E3). \u0001\n16\nCarefully note the role of (E6) in the second half of this proof. By assuming it, we\nreject the paraconsistent claim that a set - in this paper, a belief set - can be weakly\ninconsistent, in the sense of entailing one contradiction, without at the same time\nbeing strongly inconsistent, in the sense of entailing any contradiction (see Priest et\nal. [32] and Priest [31]). The very existence of paraconsistent logics is proof that\nthis rejection is necessary, as well as sufficient, to obtain a fully reversible framework.\nIndeed, starting from a paraconsistent \u22a2, definitions (**) and (***) (or plausible\nalternatives) lead to one\u2019s violating the recovery equation \u22a2 = \u22a2\u2032 of Proposition 4.\nThe proofs given in the next section tacitly assume either of the two systems (I1)-\n(I5), plus (*), or (E1)-(E6), plus (**) or (***), also tacitly exploiting their proven\nequivalence. An exception to this rule of silence is made for (I5) and (E5), i.e.,\ncompactness, which the present groundwork has shown to be detachable from the\nremaining conditions. Its major role is to prove Proposition 1, which we will apply\nwithout saying when we extend consistent sets of formulas in X to judgment sets in\nthe D\u2217- or D-sense, but it also occurs in Lemmas 3, 7, 8 and 9, and these applications\nwill be mentioned.17\n8 Proof of the lemmas\nNotation. When a profile (Ai)i\u2208N is given, we often write A instead of F ((Ai)i\u2208N),\nand for p \u2208 P , Np instead of {i \u2208 N : p \u2208 Ai} . For Z \u2286 X, we denote {\u00acp : p \u2208 Z}by\n\u00acZ.\nProof of Lemma 1. Associate with the social judgment function F : DN \u2192 2X\nand possibly with p \u2208 P the following sets of coalitions:\nDp =\n{\nC \u2286 N : \u2203(Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN , {i : p \u2208 Ai} = C & p \u2208 F ((Ai)i\u2208N)\n}\n,\nDp =\n{\nC \u2286 N : \u2200(Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN , {i : p \u2208 Ai} = C \u21d2 p \u2208 F ((Ai)i\u2208N)\n}\n,\nand\nD =\n{\nC \u2286 N : \u2200p \u2208 P,\u2200(Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN , {i : p \u2208 Ai} = C \u21d2 p \u2208 F ((Ai)i\u2208N )\n}\n.\nClearly, D \u2286 Dp \u2286 Dp. It is easy to see that F is independent on P if and only if\nDp = Dp. Now, if this equality holds, Dp satisfies condition (\u2217) of the text. Hence, if\nF is independent on P , there exists Cp generating F on p. The converse implication\nis trivial. By the same token, F is systematic on P if and only if D = Dp for all\np \u2208 P . But if these equalities hold, condition (\u2217) holds for the same set regardless of\np. Hence, if F is systematic on P , there exists CF generating F on P . The converse\nis trivial. \u0001\nProof of Lemma 2. Left to the reader.\nProof of Lemma 3. Let (b) hold. We first derive a consequence of (b), and then\nproceed to the proof itself.\n17Compactness has the effect of excluding some otherwise perfectly well-behaved logics, such as\nthe probabilistic logics (see Heifetz and Mongin [15]) and some, but not all, of the logics of common\nbelief and common knowledge (for a discussion, see Lismont and Mongin [19]).\n17\nClaim. There is a minimal inconsistent set Y \u2286 X and distinct premises p, q \u2208\nY \u2229 P such that Y\u00ac{p,q} is consistent.\nBy (b), there is at least one pair (Y, Z) of a minimal inconsistent set Y \u2286 X and\nan even-sized set of premisses Z \u2286 Y \u2229 P such that Y\u00acZ is consistent. Among these\npairs, choose one (Y,Z) such that Z has smallest size. If |Z| = 2, we are done. Thus,\nwe assume that |Z| > 2.\nChoose any distinct p, q \u2208 Z. By the minimality condition in the choice of Y and\nZ, the set Y\u00ac{p,q} is inconsistent. In fact, it is minimal inconsistent, by the following\nargument (made in a different framework by Dokow and Holzman [12]). There is\na minimal inconsistent subset W \u2286 Y\u00ac{p,q} by compactness, and we want to show\nthat W = Y\u00ac{p,q}. Both \u00acp and \u00acq are in W as otherwise W would be included\nin the consistent sets Y\u00ac{q} and Y\u00ac{p}. The set W\u00ac{\u00acp,\u00acq} is inconsistent by the\nminimality condition on the choice of Y and Z. As this inconsistent set (= {p, q, ...})\nis included in the minimal inconsistent set Y , it follows that Y = W\u00ac{\u00acp,\u00acq}, hence\nthat Y\u00ac{p,q} =W , as desired.\nNow, in the minimal inconsistent set Y\u00ac{p,q}, negate the members of Z\\{p, q};\nthis leads to Y\u00acZ , a consistent set by the choice of Y,Z. But this contradicts the\nminimality condition in this choice, because Z\\{p, q} \u2286 Y\u00ac{p,q} \u2229P is even-sized and\nhas smaller cardinality than Z.\nMain proof . Let F be as specified. Let Y, p, q be as in the above claim. We\nconsider any C \u2286 C\u2217 \u2286 N with C \u2208 C and show that C\u2217 \u2208 C. Now, by Lemma 1, it\nis enough for the proof to select a particular (Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN and a particular r \u2208 P\ns.t.\nC = Nr and r \u2208 A.\nWe extend the consistent sets Y\u00ac{p}, Y\u00ac{q} and Y\u00ac{p,q} to JS inD, resp. AY\u00ac{p} , AY\u00ac{q}\nand AY\u00ac{p,q} , and consider the profile (Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN defined by\nAi =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\nAY\u00ac{p} if i \u2208 C\nAY\u00ac{p,q} if i \u2208 C\n\u2217\\C\nAY\u00ac{q} if i \u2208 N\\C\n\u2217.\nNow, A contains q since Nq = C \u2208 C, and all \u03d5 \u2208 Y \\{p, q}, since N\u03d5 = N \u2208 C by\nLemma 2. So Y \\{p} \u2286 A. The inconsistency of Y ensures that Y \\{p} \u22a2 \u00acp, whence\n\u00acp \u2208 A by the assumption that A \u2208 D\u2217. So {i : \u00acp \u2208 Ai} \u2208 C, which implies that\nC\u2217 \u2208 C as desired. \u0001\nProof of Lemma 4. Assume (a) and (b). Take F as specified, the associated C,\nand any C,C\u2217 \u2208 C. Take Y \u2286 X as in (a). There are at least three pairwise distinct\nformulas p, q, r \u2208 Y \u2229 P , and the sets Y\u00ac{p}, Y\u00ac{q} and Y\u00ac{r} are consistent by the\nminimal inconsistency of Y . Hence, there is (Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN as follows:\n- for all i \u2208 C \u2229C\u2217, Ai extends Y\u00ac{p},\n- for all i \u2208 C\u2217\\C, Ai extends Y\u00ac{r},\n- for all i \u2208 N\\C\u2217, Ai extends Y\u00ac{q}.\nUnanimity Preservation ensures that Y \\{p, q, r} \u2286 A. Further, q \u2208 A because\nNq = (C \u2229 C\n\u2217) \u222a (C\u2217\\C) = C\u2217 \u2208 C, and r \u2208 A because Nr = (C \u2229 C\n\u2217) \u222a (N\\C\u2217) \u2287\n18\nC \u2208 C and C is superset-closed by Lemma 3. Thus, Y \\{p} \u2286 A, and \u00acp \u2208 A since Y\nis inconsistent and A \u2208 D\u2217. This is sufficient for the conclusion that C \u2229 C\u2217 \u2208 C, as\nwas to be proved. \u0001\nProof of Lemma 5. Assume (a) and (b). Take F as specified and the associated C.\nFrom Lemma 2, C does not contain \u2205, and from Lemmas 3 and 4, C is superset- and\nintersection-closed. Hence C is a filter. If moreover F : DN \u2192 D, Lemma 2 implies\nthe stronger conclusion that C is an ultrafilter. As is well-known, if N is finite, every\nfilter is the set of supersets of some M \u2286 N , and every ultrafilter the set of supersets\nof {i} for some i \u2208 N ; so that F is either an oligarchy or a dictatorship, respectively.\n\u0001\nProof of Lemma 6. For F as specified, consider p, q \u2208 P and the associated Cp,Cq.\nTake p \u22a2\u2217 q, and let C \u2208 Cp. By definition of \u22a2\n\u2217, there is Y \u2286 X s.t. Y \u222a{p} and\nY \u222a {\u00acq} are consistent, and Y \u222a {p,\u00acq} is inconsistent. As the last claim implies,\nY \u222a{p, q} and Y \u222a{\u00acp,\u00acq} are consistent, and there exists (Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN as follows:\n- for all i \u2208 C, Ai extends Y \u222a {p, q},\n- for all i \/\u2208 C, Ai extends Y \u222a {\u00acp,\u00acq}.\nWith this profile, Y \u2286 A by Unanimity Preservation, and p \u2208 A because {i : p \u2208\nAi} \u2208 Cp. So q \u2208 A since A \u2208 D\n\u2217. By Nq = C and q \u2208 A, we have that C \u2208 Cq, as\nwas to be proved.\nSuppose now that (c) holds. Then, for all p, q \u2208 P , the sequence of conditional\nentailments p \u22a2\u2217 p2, ..., pk\u22121 \u22a2\n\u2217 q made available by this condition leads to a corre-\nsponding sequence of inclusions Cp \u2286 Cp2 , ..., Cpk\u22121 \u2286 Cq, and then to Cp = Cq, so that\nby Lemma 1, F is systematic on P. \u0001\nProof of Lemma 7. Let |N | \u2265 3, and let (a) be violated. Then there is an odd-sized\ncoalition M \u2286 N with |M | \u000f= 1. For any (Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN , we define the set\nB = (\u2229i\u2208NAi) \u222a {p \u2208 P : |{i \u2208M : p \u2208 Ai}| > |M | \/2}.\n(In words, B collects all formulas unanimously accepted and all premisses accepted\nby a majority within M .) We will show that B is consistent. If not, by compactness,\nB has a finite minimal inconsistent subset Y \u2286 B. As (a) does not hold, |Y \u2229 P | \u2264 2,\nhence |Y \u2229 P | = 2 since X contains no contradictions. Say Y \u2229 P = {p, q}. Within\nM , a majority accepts p, and a majority accepts q. As two majorities must overlap,\nthere is an j \u2208 M s.t. {p, q} \u2286 Aj . So Y \u2229 P \u2286 Aj . Hence, as also Y \\P \u2286 Aj,\nY \u2286 Aj. So Ai is inconsistent, a contradiction.\nHaving just shown that B is consistent, B can be extended to a set in D; let\nF ((Ai)i\u2208N) be one such extension. Note that, as B is already complete w.r.t. P ,\nF ((Ai)i\u2208N) \u2229 P = B \u2229 P = {p \u2208 P : |{i \u2208M : p \u2208 Ai}| > |M | \/2}.\nSo we have defined a social judgment function F : DN \u2192 D that is generated on\nP by C = {C \u2286 M : |C| > |M | \/2}. Lemma 1 implies that F is systematic. Also,\nF is unanimity-preserving by construction. And C is not a filter, because C is not\n19\nintersection-closed (take, e.g., two majorities of |M|+1\n2\nindividuals that intersect on a\nsingleton). \u0001\nProof of Lemma 8. Let |N | \u2265 3; so N contains three distinct individuals, to be\nlabelled 1,2,3. Let (b) be violated. For any (Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN , we define B = B1 \u222a B2,\nwhere\nB1 = A1 \u2229A2 \u2229A3\nand\nB2 = {p \u2208 P : p is in exactly one of A1, A2, A3}.\nWe prove that B is consistent. Suppose not, then by compactness there is a finite\nminimal inconsistent subset Y \u2286 B. Define Y \u2217 = Y \u2229 P and A\u2217i = Ai \u2229 P for all\ni \u2208 N . We have Y \u2217 \u000f= \u2205, as otherwise Y \u2286 B1 \u2286 A1, an impossibility since Y is\ninconsistent and A1 is consistent. Now, Y\n\u2217 can be expressed as the pairwise disjoint\nunion of the following sets:\nZ0 = Y\n\u2217 \u2229A\u22171 \u2229A\n\u2217\n2 \u2229A\n\u2217\n3, Z1 = Y\n\u2217 \u2229 [A\u22171\\(A\n\u2217\n2 \u222aA\n\u2217\n3)] ,\nZ2 = Y\n\u2217 \u2229 [A\u22172\\(A\n\u2217\n1 \u222aA\n\u2217\n3)] , Z3 = Y\n\u2217 \u2229 [A\u22173\\(A\n\u2217\n1 \u222aA\n\u2217\n2)] .\nThere must exist two sets among Z1, Z2, Z3, say w.l.g. Z1, Z2, such that |Z1 \u222a Z2|\nis even and Z1 \u222a Z2 \u000f= \u2205. (The first claim is simply combinatorial, and the second\none follows by contradiction from the consistency of A3, since Z1 \u222a Z2 = \u2205 leads to\nY \u2217 \u2286 A3, hence to Y \u2286 A3.) Put Z = Z1 \u222a Z2. Since (b) does not hold, we will have\nderived a contradiction if we show that\nY\u00acZ = (Y \\Z) \u222a \u00acZ\nis consistent. Now, Y\u00acZ can be obtained as the union\nY = (Y \\Y \u2217) \u222a (Y \u2217\\Z) \u222a \u00acZ,\nwhere (i) Y \\Y \u2217 \u2286 B1 \u2286 A3, (ii) Y\n\u2217\\Z = Y \u2217\u2229A\u22173 \u2286 A\n\u2217\n3, and (iii) \u00acZ = {\u00acp : p \u2208 Y\n\u2217, p \/\u2208 A\u22173} \u2286\n{\u00acp : p \u2208 P, p \/\u2208 A\u22173} = A\n\u2217\n3. The last equality holds as A\n\u2217\n3 = A3 \u2229 P contains exactly\none member of each pair p,\u00acp \u2208 P . Putting (i), (ii) and (iii) together, we see that\nY\u00acZ \u2286 A3, hence that Y\u00acZ is consistent, as we aimed at proving.\nHaving shown B to be consistent, we can extend B to a set in D; this set is our\nF ((Ai)i\u2208N). Note that, as B is already complete w.r.t. P ,\nF ((Ai)i\u2208N) \u2229 P = B \u2229 P = {p \u2208 P : |Np| is odd}.\nSo the just-defined social judgment function F : DN  \u2192 D is generated on P by\nCF = {C \u2286 N : |C \u2229 {1, 2, 3}| is odd}.\nHence, F is systematic on P from Lemma 1; it is also unanimity-preserving since\n\u2229i\u2208NAi \u2286 B1 \u2286 F ((Ai)i\u2208N). But C\nF is not a filter, as it is not superset-closed. \u0001\nProof of Lemma 9. Let (c) be violated. As |N | \u2265 2, N contains distinct indi-\nviduals, to be labelled 1 and 2. For p, q \u2208 P , define pRq if there is a sequence of\n20\nconditional entailments from p to q as in the statement of (c). As (c) does not hold,\nthere are p\u00af, q\u00af \u2208 P such that not p\u00afRq\u00af, and P can be partitioned into two non-empty\nsets\nS1 = {p \u2208 P : p\u00afRp} and S2 = {p \u2208 P : not p\u00afRp}.\nNote that\np \u000f\u22a2\u2217 q for all p \u2208 S1 and all q \u2208 S2. (1)\nWe can further partition S1 into the sets\nS11 = {p \u2208 S1 : \u00acp \u2208 S1} and S12 = {p \u2208 S1 : \u00acp \u2208 S2},\nand similarly, S2 into the sets\nS21 = {p \u2208 S2 : \u00acp \u2208 S1} and S22 = {p \u2208 S2 : \u00acp \u2208 S2}.\nNow, consider any (Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN . We first define B \u2286 P as follows: for all p \u2208 P ,\np \u2208 B \u21d4\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\np \u2208 A1 if p \u2208 S11\np \u2208 A2 if p \u2208 S22\np \u2208 A1 \u222aA2 if p \u2208 S12\np \u2208 A1 \u2229A2 if p \u2208 S21.\nWe set out to prove that B \u222a (A1 \u2229A2) is a consistent set. Suppose not; then by\ncompactness, there is a minimal inconsistent subset Y \u2286 B \u222a (A1 \u2229A2). Hence,\np \u22a2\u2217 \u00acq for all distinct p, q \u2208 Y. (2)\nWe will prove six claims relative to Y \u2217 = Y \u2229B, leading eventually to a contradiction.\n(i) Y \u2217 \u000f\u2286 S11 \u222a S21. If not, the definition of B implies that Y\n\u2217 \u2286 A1, and Y \u2286 A1,\na consistent set.\n(ii) Y \u2217 \u000f\u2286 S22 \u222a S21 by a similar argument.\n(iii) Y \u2217\u2229S12 \u000f= \u2205. If not, Y \u2217 \u2286 S11\u222aS22\u222aS21, and by (i) and (ii), there are p, q \u2208 Y \u2217\nwith p \u2208 S11 and q \u2208 S22, hence also \u00acq \u2208 S22. By (2), p \u22a2\u2217 \u00acq, contradicting\n(1).\n(iv) Y \u2217 \u2229 S12 = {r}. If there were r, s \u2208 Y \u2217 \u2229 S12, r \u000f= s, (2) would imply that\ns \u22a2\u2217 \u00acr, in contradiction with (1).\n(v) Y \u2217 \u2229 S11 = \u2205. If not, by (2) p \u22a2\n\u2217 \u00acr, contradicting (1).\n(vi) Y \u2217 \u2229 S22 = \u2205 by a similar argument.\nFrom (iv), (v) and (vi), Y \u2217 \u2286 {r} \u222a S21 \u2286 {r} \u222a (A1 \u2229 A2), where the second\ninclusion follows from the definition of B. Since Y \u2286 Y \u2217 \u222a (A1 \u2229 A2), it also holds\nthat Y \u2286 {r}\u222a (A1 \u2229A2). The definition of B implies that r \u2208 A1 or r \u2208 A2, whence\neither Y \u2286 A1 or Y \u2286 A2, a contradiction with the consistency of A1 and A2.\nFor all (Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN , one can extend the consistent set B \u222a (A1 \u2229 A2) to one\nin D, so as to define a social judgment function F : DN \u2192 D. As B was already\ncomplete w.r.t. P , we have F ((Ai)i\u2208N )\u2229P = B \u2229P for all (Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN . It follows\nthat, for every p \u2208 P , F is generated on p by some Cp, hence by Lemma 1 that F is\nindependent on P . F is unanimity-preserving since \u2229i\u2208NAi \u2286 A1 \u2229A2 \u2286 A. Finally,\nCp is not the same for all p \u2208 P , because S1 and S2 are each non-empty, and if p \u2208 S1\n21\nthen Cp is {C \u2286 N : 1 \u2208 C} or 2\nN\\{\u2205}, whereas if p \u2208 S2 then Cp is {C \u2286 N : 2 \u2208 C}\nor {N}. \u0001\nProof of Lemma 10. Let N be finite. Suppose (d) holds and F : DN \u2192 D is a\ndictatorship on P . Let j be the dictator on P . Let G : DN \u2192 D be dictatorship\non X by individual j. To show that F = G, we consider any (Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN and\nshow that F ((Ai)i\u2208N) = G((Ai)i\u2208N ). As F ((Ai)i\u2208N) and G((Ai)i\u2208N) and each in D,\nit suffices to show that F ((Ai)i\u2208N) \u2286 G((Ai)i\u2208N ). Consider any \u03d5 \u2208 F ((Ai)i\u2208N).\nLet S := F ((Ai)i\u2208N ) \u2229 P . By (d), either S \u22a2 \u03d5 or S \u22a2 \u00ac\u03d5. It cannot be that\nS \u22a2 \u00ac\u03d5, since otherwise F ((Ai)i\u2208N) would contain \u00ac\u03d5 by deductive closure, hence\nbe inconsistent. So S \u22a2 \u03d5. By definition of G, G((Ai)i\u2208N) \u2229 P = F ((Ai)i\u2208N) \u2229 P ,\nwhence G((Ai)i\u2208N) \u2229 P = S. So also G((Ai)i\u2208N) entails \u03d5. Hence, as G((Ai)i\u2208N) is\ndeductively closed, \u03d5 \u2208 G((Ai)i\u2208N ), as desired. \u0001\nProof of Lemma 11. If (d) is violated, there is a set S that is complete w.r.t. P\nand s.t. for some \u03d5 \u2208 X\\P , both S \u222a {\u03d5} and S \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5} are consistent. These two\nsets can be extended, so that there are B,B\u2032 \u2208 D with B \u2229P = B\u2032 \u2229P , but B \u000f= B\u2032.\nLet 1 be any individual in N , and let F : DN \u2192 D be defined by the condition that\nfor all (Ai)i\u2208N \u2208 D\nN ,\nA =\n{\nB if A1 = B\n\u2032 and Ai = B for all i \u2208 N\\{1}\nA1 otherwise.\nThis F is not dictatorial, and unanimity-preserving; and because 1 is a dictator on\nP it is also systematic, hence independent, on P . \u0001\n9 References\nReferences\n[1] C.C.
