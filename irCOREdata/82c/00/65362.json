Harvey\u2019s work established foundational \nconcepts for understanding how space, time, place and nature are constituted and \nrepresented through social practices - not as separate elements but in relation to each other.  \nJNGD called for \u2018critical ways to think about how differences in ecological, cultural, economic, \npolitical, and social conditions get produced \u2026 and we also need ways to evaluate the justice \n\/ injustice of the differences so produced\u2019 (1996: 5).  Crucially, for our purposes, Harvey \nhighlights the production of geographical differences as fundamental to the exploration, and \nindeed resolution, of contemporary urban problems. \nA decade later, and taking Harvey\u2019s work as a starting point, this IJURR symposium - \nwhich emerges from a session at the 2006 meeting of the RGS-IBG - examines how concepts \nof justice and nature in urban places are being constructed, reworked and contested - and the \nextent to which common ground between concerns for social and environmental justice can \nand is being forged in the city.  While concerns for social justice and the social life of cities \nhave long been a mainstay of geographical work, the linking of environmentalism to problems \nof the city and associated processes of urbanization remains a relatively underdeveloped \narena of geographical inquiry (Schweitzer and Stephenson Jr., 2007).  Indeed, in 1996 \nHarvey referred to the integration of the urbanization question into the environmental-\necological question as a sine qua non for the twenty-first century (429).  The relative neglect \nof such work is perhaps more surprising given that it is in urban areas where transformations \nof nature are most visible \u2013 both in physical expression and in socio-ecological consequences \n(Swyngedouw and Heynen, 2003) \u2013 and which are becoming increasingly important strategic \nsites for an array of different forms of environmentalism (White and Wilbert, 2006).  Issues of \n 2 \nurban political ecologies and environmental inequalities have only recently begun to gain \nanalytical purchase (e.g. Heynen et al., 2006; Keil, 2003; Walker and Bulkeley, 2006).  Keil \n(2003), for instance, has identified four \u2018strongholds\u2019 of the emerging Urban Political Ecology \n(UPE) project \u2013 an exercise which, although carrying the perils of any such categorisation, \ndoes usefully describe this body of work and the central issues and challenges being tackled \naround the concerns of justice, nature and urban life that we return to below.  The first of \nthese strongholds consists of work focused on the political ecology of the Los Angeles \/ \nSouthern Californian region.  Los Angeles, with its volatile and violent environment, has \ncaptured the imagination of many urban writers (Keil, 2003: 731) - with authors (such as \nDavis, 1998; Wolch, Pincentl and Pulido, 2002; Gottlieb, 2001; Walker 2007) offering rich \naccounts of the history and geography of LA\u2019s socionatural environment(s) and through these \nrecasting the way we see the (South Californian) urban landscape.  The second body of work, \nparticularly influenced by the work of Erik Swyngedouw, has two primary, and related, \ninterests: i) the articulation of a Marxist theorisation of UPE (Swyngedouw et al., 2002; Ka\u00efka \nand Swyngedouw, 2000; Castro et al., 2003) and ii) the political ecology of urban water \u2013 \nhow, through water, nature and society are tied in the production of a sociospatial fabric that \nprivileges some and excludes many (Swyngedouw, 1997: 329).  Work in the latter field - now \nmarked by its geographical breadth, covering many cities of the global South as well as North \n- includes Swyngedouw (1997; 2004) on hydrological modernisation in Guayaquil, Ecuador; \nBond (2002) on water resource management in Johannesburg and residual apartheid \necologies; Gandy (2008) on the particularities of capitalist urbanisation and state formation in \nIndia, which have given rise to Mumbai\u2019s current water infrastructure crisis; and Castro \n(2004), Loftus (2007) and Bakker (2007) on the consequences (for Mexico City, Durban, and \nJakarta respectively) of neoliberal policies, based on the commodification of water resources, \nfor exacerbating existing conflicts and inequalities.  A third body of research (originating \npredominantly from the UK) is directed at a critical engagement with urban and regional \nenvironmental and economic policy, including discussion on the political ecological \ncomplexities of \u201dlocal sustainability\u201d (e.g. Gibbs and Jonas, 2000).  Finally, the work of a \ngroup (predominantly US and UK based) concerned with the UPE of environmental justice \n(e.g. Agyeman, Bullard and Evans, 2003; Agyeman, 2005; Sze, 2007) addresses issues of \n 3 \nsustainability, justice and the discourse on rights and democracy. Taking our lead from such \nwork, this collection of papers will address and debate the everyday urban nature(s) of \nenvironmental in\/justice (which have often evaded sustained inquiry), the fundamentally \nspatial and political basis to claims of injustice and the implications of this work for developing \nsocio-ecologically \u2018just\u2019 cities.  \nThe concept of environmental justice (EJ) is a useful starting point for exploring this \nnexus of ideas: it is a term that captures the differential exposure to environmental bads and \naccess to environmental goods experienced by different social groups (Schweitzer and \nStephenson Jr., 2007).  Sociologist Robert Bullard was one of the first academics to study the \nrelationship between the location of hazardous sites and the social characteristics of nearby \ncommunities.  He found that virtually all landfills in Houston, Texas were located in or near \nAfrican American neighbourhoods (Bullard, 1983).  Many studies followed his initial work \u2013 all \nhighlighting the socio-spatial inequities inherent in urban environments and citing practices of \nurban segregation and housing discrimination as direct contributors to environmental injustice \n(for an overview see Szaz and Meuser, 1997).  The concern of EJ research and activism with \nthe consequences of environmental hazards for marginalised communities brings together \nquestions of social and ecological justice, and in doing so expands our understanding of the \n\u2018environment\u2019 \u2013 away from unspoiled \u2018natural\u2019 areas to include populated urban spaces \n(Schweitzer and Stephenson Jr., 2007).  In this way, EJ work has succeeding in making \nissues of race, class, culture and gender integral to the discourse and politics of \nenvironmentalism, as well as highlighting the ways in which physical environments can affect \nthe quality of life of those who reside in urban places. Other authors have raised concerns \nabout this body of work and the implicit constructions of \u2018urban\u2019, \u2018nature\u2019 and \u2018justice\u2019 \ncontained within it \u2013 issues that run through this introduction and the subsequent papers.   \nFirstly, attention needs to be paid to the ways in which EJ is defined.  Here, we must \nrecall that much EJ work has been framed by the specifics of the environmental justice \nmovement in the US (Walker and Bulkeley, 2006).  Although the terminology of environmental \njustice has travelled well beyond the States (for instance Debban\u00e9 and Keil, 2004; Walker and \nBulkeley, 2006) its meaning has remained problematic and heavily contested.  In generalised \nterms we can see EJ either as being closely tied to the movement\u2019s origins and a focus on the \n 4 \nsocio-spatial distribution of pollution, toxicity and other forms of socio-ecological harm or as \nbeing linked to a more encompassing (and perhaps even indiscriminate) set of concerns or \nprinciples associated with the multiple sites, forms and processes of injustice \u2013 articulated in \nparticular through a sustainability lens (Walker and Bulkeley, 2006; Agyeman, 2002). \nRelated to this point, we see something of a conflation of environmental and social \njustice issues, leading many to argue (some would suggest mistakenly) that the solution to \nthe latter is a necessary prerequisite to any attempt to address the former.  Whilst the relative \nlack of agreement and specificity in the terminology and principles of EJ genuinely offers a \nlevel of flexibility \u2013 and as such a powerful rhetorical resource \u2013 it has arguably limited the \nconcept\u2019s power as a guide to policy and action.  It is a tension between the need to keep \nthings open and fluid \u2013 to allow for particularity - and the need to make them solid and \ncategorical - that is, to universalize - that Harvey (1996) himself grapples with.  He asks \nwhether it is possible \u2018ever to talk about justice as anything other than a contested effect of \npower within a particular place at a given time' (Ibid, 329) but simultaneously recognizes \njustice as \u2018a foundational concept that is quite indispensable in the regulation of human \naffairs' (Ibid, 332).  It is precisely these sorts of conceptual ambiguities that have led authors \nsuch as Debban\u00e9 and Keil (2004), developing a critical engagement with urban environmental \npolicy, to reject the search for a universal notion of environmental justice - instead advocating \nan understanding that is contextually situated.  It is a position which acknowledges the far-\nreaching political, economic and ecological networks that create specific instances of \nenvironmental injustice, and is one with which we are broadly sympathetic in this symposium. \nThe second set of issues raised, and linked to the conceptual underpinnings of \nenvironmental justice work, rest on the fact that whilst urban environments have been (and \ncontinue to be) the focus of much EJ activism and research, few studies have been situated \nwithin the larger context of urbanisation and urban research (for an exception see Sze 2007 \non New York City).  In this respect, a number of authors, many working within what Keil \n(2003) describes as a Marxist UPE tradition (e.g.  Heynen et al., 2006) have been critical of \nenvironmental (justice) theory for (largely) ignoring the urban political ecologies that influence \nmany environmental problems.  The praxis concerns of environmental justice research can be \ntraced in a literature that remains rooted in local political activism and distributional issues to \n 5 \nthe relative neglect of theoretical engagement with the historical structural processes leading \nto uneven urban environments (Heynen, 2006: 501).  Lines of critical research, addressing \nthe UPE of environmental justice, have emerged and are becoming more established (see \nPellow and Brulle, 2006; Agyeman et al., 2003; Pulido, 2000).  Sze (2007: 9), in a finely-\ngrained history of environmental justice in New York City, argues that the rise of activism is \ncrucially a racialised and local response to the \u2018the politics of neoliberalism\u2019 - economic and \ndevelopment policies that favour deregulation, privatization, and free market approaches - \ncurrently shaping the urban ecology of postindustrial global cities.  Her focus on the histories \nand effects of particular urban policies for affected communities in terms of their racial and \ncommunity identity, eschews narrow debate over \u201crace versus class\u201d and overt discriminatory \nintent (cf. Pulido, 2000).  Notwithstanding such examples in the literature, there remains a \nrather diminished conceptualisation of the socio-ecological and fundamentally political \nprocesses that generate environmental and social injustices in urban spaces.  The \nsymposium therefore provides an important contribution to this work, and prompts a stronger \nengagement between EJ research and many of the conceptual questions - centring on \npolitics, social power, institutional configurations, discourses and belief systems - that drive \nUPE.  Swyngedouw (this issue), for instance, is particularly concerned to theorise the \n\u2018political\u2019 as a fundamental condition for addressing questions of urban environmental \ninjustice.  We might add that the issue of scale in the production and identification of in\/justice \nis far from comprehensively addressed in environmental justice research (for some important \nexceptions see: Heynen, 2003; Debban\u00e9 and Keil, 2004; Towers, 2000).  Indeed, this is a \ntopic that a number of authors in this symposium address.  Scale is central to Hillier\u2019s account \nof the folded, networked spaces \u2013 the connections of presence and absence \u2013 which \nconstitute a singular form of \u2018just\u2019 (or unjust) decision in the context of planning processes \n(taking the example of debate around the so-called ghost ships of Hartlepool, North-East \nEngland), and to Whitehead\u2019s exploration of the ordinary environmental injustices produced \nby a large scale urban forest. \nThirdly, in empirical terms, the focus of the environmental justice movement and the \nwider research literature has been on particular kinds of pollution \u2013 toxics, dangerous \ncontamination and the effects of major environmental hazards such as Hurricane Katrina in \n 6 \n2005 \u2013 relying heavily upon symbolic politics and powerful media icons of pollution and \ndisaster (Harvey, 1996).  The consequence, we would suggest, is a relative neglect of more \nmundane and chronic forms of injustice manifest in the urban environment.  It is a form of bias \nin the choice of targets that has led some critics to charge that the concerns of the movement \nare misplaced, that its politics are based on an iconography and politics of fear, and that its \nclaims have  \nmore to do with moral outrage than the science of impacts (Harvey, 1996: 338) \nReturning to the urban, Heynen (2006) comments on the relative absence of the \nissue of access to natural resources in the environmental justice literature \u2013 which he argues \nis a common injustice for marginalized urban populations.  Whitehead (this issue) similarly \ncalls for a move away from the environmentalism embodied by much of the EJ literature, \nwhich he argues leads to a narrow framing of the spaces of urban environmental injustice in \nterms of the dramatic and spectacular.  Although there is work that goes some way to \nresponding to this characterisation in the US (Brownlow, 2006; Heynen, 2003) and in the UK - \nwhere we arguably see a stronger research focus on the everyday features of urban \nlandscapes (Stephens et al., 2001; Lucas et al., 2004) - there remains a persistent absence of \nengagement with the mundane and banal landscapes of in\/justice.  This is a challenge that is \ntaken up very directly by authors in this symposium.  Whitehead and Dooling, in particular, \nseek to refocus attention on ordinary forms of socio-ecological in\/justice in their accounts of \naccess to different kinds of urban nature. \nIn seeking to address these issues, the papers in this symposium bring together \nresearch from very different social, historical, political and ecological settings.  In this regard, \nthe collection offers a timely insight into the processes, practices and relations by which \nsocio-ecological in\/justice is produced, mobilised and contested.  Although the collection \ndiscusses only the developed world, it does bring together a varied scholarship that focuses \non the social and ecological facets of urban environmental in\/justice.  The papers offer a \nrange of novel theoretical frameworks for rethinking and extending our understanding of \nsocio-ecological justice in urban places.  In so doing, the authors raise and seek to address \nsome profoundly important questions about the social and material production of \nenvironmental in\/justices, as well as the politics and governance of socio-ecological harm \n 7 \nacross different spaces, places, scales and times.  In the remaining sections of this \nintroduction we explore three overarching themes \u2013 on the theorisation, hybridity and spatial \npolitics of socio-ecological in\/justice - that run through the contributions to this collection, and \nconsider their implications for arguments about the relationships between justice, nature and \nthe city.  \n \nTheorising socio-ecological in\/justice and the city \n \nAuthors in this collection are concerned to engage, critically, with the ways in which \ncontemporary environmental injustices are produced, identified and addressed within \ndistinctly metropolitan contexts.  Each paper develops different, in many cases  \nsituated, notions of nature, justice and the urban (also Debban\u00e9 and Keil, 2004). \nSwyngedouw, taking the cue of political philosophers and theorists like \u017di\u017eek, Ranci\u00e8re and \nBadiou, amongst others, approaches the necessary conditions for tackling questions of urban \nsocio-ecological injustice through the theoretical lens of the \u2018properly political\u2019.  Here, he \nstresses the need for a move away from a condition of environmental polic(y)ing (or a mode \nof consensus policy-making where disruption and dissent are minimized) to an environmental \npolitics that enables articulation of (and engagement with) radical dissent and rupture.  \nDooling uses Agamben's notion of bare life to explore the disconnection between notions of \nhome articulated by homeless people living in Seattle\u2019s green spaces and the ideological \nconstructions of home, homeless and public green space espoused by planning agencies and \n(housed) citizens.   She uses this analysis to propose the concept of ecological gentrification, \nwhich is explicit in its recognition of the tensions between goals of ecological and social \njustice.  The concept captures the ways in which planning agendas linked to green spaces \ncan lead to the displacement or exclusion of the most economically vulnerable human \npopulation \u2013 homeless people \u2013 whilst simultaneously espousing an environmental ethic.  \nHillier offers a distinctly relational approach to theorising socio-ecological justice through a \nDeleuzo-Guattarian cartography which traces the assemblies, multiplicities and trajectories \nthrough which dismantling the 'ghost' ships in Hartlepool (UK) was constructed and contested \nas an issue of social and ecological injustice.  Finally, in an analysis of ordinary environmental \n 8 \ninjustice in the Black Country Urban Forest (located in a wider \u2013 UK - region marked by a high \nlevel of urban dereliction), Whitehead, drawing on a Lefebvre-inspired interpretation of \neveryday life and banality, addresses the assumed connection between urban ecological \nimprovement and the achievement of social and environmental justice goals.  Like Hillier, he \nstresses the often problematic mobilisation of concepts of urban social and ecological \ninjustice \u2013 which, he suggests, can unwittingly militate against the more everyday concerns of \nordinary environmental justice. \nIn each of these papers, an engagement with novel theoretical approaches for \nunderstanding socio-ecological in\/justice raises questions about how we conceptualise \nnature, the city, the subject, and various facets of justice, including rights and responsibilities.  \nThe collection demonstrates the rich potential for taking the study of EJ beyond the confines \nof existing analyses of struggles over the distribution of environmental goods and bads, and \nin particular the significance of thinking about in\/justice in terms of a \u2018more complex ethical \nfield of inter-material relations\u2019 (Whitehead, this issue). \n \nHybrid urban environments \/ environmental justices:  \n \nTerms like \u2018nature\u2019 and \u2018environment\u2019 are, of course, inherently contingent and need \nto be situated within the wider set of conditions and relations that give rise to them.  Harvey \n(1996: 119), points to a pervasive anti-urban bias in much ecological rhetoric \u2013 citing the \nessentially arbitrary distinction made between the built environments of cities (as un-natural) \nand the humanly modified environments of rural regions (as natural).  In this vein he talks \nabout New York City as a \u2018created ecosystem\u2019 \u2013 stressing that human activity cannot be read \nas external to ecological processes.  Indeed, environmental issues have emerged that are \nspecific to the ecologies of urban places (Ibid: 186).  The corollary to this, in the context of \ngeography\u2019s engagement with nature and the environment, is the now widespread recognition \nof (urban) natures as simultaneously socially and materially produced (Heynen et al., 2006; \nBraun and Castree, 1998; Castree, 2005; Gandy, 2002; Harvey, 1996; Keil, 2003; \nSwyngedouw, 1999).  Debate has therefore moved away from the interaction of nature and \nsociety towards an approach that recognises that society is constituted through the \n 9 \ntransformation of nature and that nature is equally constituted through social change and \nsocial labour (Heynen et al., 2006).  As a consequence, it is no longer possible, as the \nauthors in this symposium make clear, to talk about the urban and the natural as antagonists. \nIn this regard, one of the key insights shared by urban political ecologists, and by the \nauthors in this collection, is that \u2018the material and symbolic, the natural and the cultural, the \npristine and the urban are not dual and separate realities but rather intertwined and \ninseparable aspects of the world we inhabit\u2019 (Keil, 2003: 728).  In a similar vein, Swyngedouw \n(2006) argues for the use of metaphors of the metabolism and circulation of nature, \ndeveloping ideas of Haraway and Latour on cyborgs and \u2018hybridity\u2019 to politicize processes of \nurbanisation in a fashion that is complementary to political projects of socio-ecological justice.  \nThe papers in the collection work to decentre universal assumptions about (urban) nature and \njustice and offer more complex understandings which interweave social and material \nprocesses.  In Whitehead\u2019s discussion of the West Midlands\u2019 Black Country area and the high \nlevels of land dereliction in this region -  a legacy of long-term industrial decline - ordinary \ninjustices are not simply a product of the concentration of unwanted environmental \nexternalities.  Rather, \u2018ordinary injustice is produced at the intersection of these two \nprocesses\u2019 (Whitehead, this issue).  The authors in this collection demonstrate how the \nhybridity of socio-ecologies demands not only analytical perspectives which are sensitive to \nthe substance of nature as integral to social, economic and political processes, but also an \nunderstanding of the diversity of possible relations.  The recognition of hybridity also \ndestabilises the taken for granted boundaries around which in\/justice is thought to accrue.  \nDooling makes this point very effectively in her analysis of the use of notions of home \narticulated by homeless individuals in urban green spaces \u2013 arguing that it is only in \n\u2018conceptualizing green spaces as complex habitats for non-human and human inhabitants, \nthat the narrow conceptions of home implicit in the design and management of shelter and \nhousing options are challenged\u2019.  Hillier calls for \u2018relational ontologies of social and \nenvironmental justice which turn from traditional ontologies of individual, bounded subjects \u2026 \nto recognize that residents and birds alike are enmeshed in far broader space-time relations \u2019.  \nSuch insights offer food for thought for mainstream EJ work concerned with the risks and \n 10 \nrights of individual subjects, suggesting that as we recognise the hybridity of socio-ecological \nprocesses, there is a need to embrace more relational ways of thinking about justice.  \n \nThe spatial politics of urban environmental justice: \n \nOur final theme places the political at the centre of contemporary debates on justice, \nnature and the city.  Political ecologists have been successful in linking politics and \neconomics to the production of environmental degradation, poverty, marginality and \nvulnerability in the city (Robbins et al., 2001; Swyngedouw et al., 2002; Wolch, 2007; Gibbs, \n2002) \u2013 drawing out the power relations (whether material or discursive, economic, political, \nor cultural) through which particular socio-ecological conditions are produced and maintained.  \nIn Heat Wave, for instance, Eric Klinenberg (2002) takes us inside the anatomy of the \nChicago metropolis to conduct what he calls a \"social autopsy\" of the 1995 heat wave linked \nto a staggering 739 deaths, particularly among the poor, elderly and reclusive.  He examines \nthe social, political, and institutional organs of the city that made this urban disaster worse \nthan it ought to have been \u2013 and meant that some neighbourhoods experienced greater \nmortality than others.  Critically, redundant but fragmented city support services catered to the \nmost vocal, proactive, consumers - thereby ensuring neglect of the generally reticent elderly \nand infirm who led insular lives in a \"culture of fear\".  Social injustices were in this way \nstructurally built into the fabric of the city. \nIt follows from such work that we cannot neatly define a city or urban place as un\/just \nper se.  Hurricane Katrina, which in 2005 hit Southern states in the US, and specifically the \ncity of New Orleans, speaks to the social power relations underpinning such urban ecological \ndisasters and how they are collectively understood \u2013 with the social segregation of the city \ncentre, the suburbs and surrounding towns particularly significant in shaping the differential \nimpact of the hurricane on rich and poor (Rydin, 2006: 4; Bakker, 2005).  The crisis also \nraised distinctly political questions about how authorities permitted development in vulnerable \nlocations \u2013 and about the trade-offs between the ecological and economic benefits of wetland \nenvironments.  Whilst Hurricane Katrina, and the political response, prompted intense debate \naround a host of local planning and governance questions, it also touched on decision \n 11 \nmaking, and the inadequacies of leadership at much higher political levels.  The ensuing \n`blame game', centring on individual incompetence, arguably distracted debate from more \nfundamental questions about the role of the state, and of markets, in producing `natural' \ndisasters that are fundamentally inequitable in their socio-ecological impacts (Bakker, 2005: \n798; Braun and McCarthy, 2005).  In a similar vein, for Peck (2006: 693), the dominant \npolitical narrative that located blame for the disaster in federal bureaucracy and the long term \nconsequences of urban welfarism (reflected in a discourse of personal responsibility and \nculpability, displacing an earlier emphasis on victimisation) legitimated a renewal programme \nfor New Orleans embodying a new urban agenda of enlarging the role for private enterprise, \nselective institutional roll-backs focused on the social state, redoubled crime control and an \ninterventionist program of \u201cmoral reconstruction\u201d aimed at those stranded in the storm\u2019s wake.  \nKatrina is thus a case which speaks very directly to what we might term an ethical imperative \nof rights and responsibility: that is, how parties in political and civic life construct their social \nand ecological obligations in relation to the pursuit of the just city (Peck, 2006; Rydin, 2006; \nAgyeman et al., 2003) and what it actually means (and who is able) to be an urban ecological \ncitizen (Wolch, 2007).  It is a set of ethical issues that a number of authors in this collection \naddress.  Whitehead, for instance, considers how notions of environmental neglect challenge \nideal-type ethical discourses of social responsibility \u2013 that is, how the issue of neglect frames \na sense of obligation not just in terms of visible harm but also in terms of the consequences of \ninaction or lack of care that impinge on the everyday.  Hiller considers how responsibilities for \ndistant strangers \u2013 in the shape of the ship-breakers of South Asia \u2013 became entangled with \nsocio-ecological in\/justice in Hartlepool as the conflict over the Ghost Ships was enacted.  \nThere are, then, no neat boundaries around what constitutes \u2018urban\u2019 in\/justice, and, indeed, \nthe spatial politics through which such conflicts are framed can have profound consequences \nfor how they are contested and resolved. \nThe authors also consider different forms of (post) political response to urban natures \nand claims of environmental injustice.  Swyngedouw presents a radical re-interpretation of \nurban environmental politics and considers the consequences of a post-political condition for \ndiscussions of environmental justice, equality and democracy.  He is particularly critical of a \nneo-liberal vision of environmental governance, a reliance on expert knowledge and \n 12 \nadministration and what he terms populist environmentalism (in particular through forms of \nparticipatory deliberative practice), which he sees as supporting the established social order \nand restricting scope for debate, disagreement and dissensus - in short, politics proper.  \nHillier speaks to these same issues and processes in her analysis of the \u2018consensual\u2019 policy-\nmaking surrounding the Hartlepool ghost ships.  This is a challenging insight for scholars of \nEJ for it requires a move beyond seeking to open up the channels of decision-making to \u2018just\u2019 \nprocesses of involvement, and rather a recognition of the need to work against and outside \ncurrent modes of environmental governance in order to properly confront the distinctly political \ncauses of in\/justice.  Other authors in this collection follow this line of thinking to some degree \nby challenging the dominant framing of environmental injustice in terms of extreme \nexploitation of urban nature(s) and urging instead a stronger theoretical and political \nengagement with the (more) ordinary or banal meanings and spaces of urban in\/justice \u2013 \u201cthat \nexpand and insinuate themselves largely below the radar\u201d (Robbins and Sharp, 2006: 111, \nalso Whitehead, this issue).  Such a strategy entails engagement with alternative political \nspaces where in\/justice is contested and configured.  Dooling argues that homelessness is a \ndeeply political problem tied closely to the exercise of sovereign power (delivered through \npolicymakers, providers and law enforcement). She offers an account of the ways in which \nmultiple strategies of being-at-home, practised by homeless individuals in the urban green \nspaces of Seattle, challenged the dominant political construction of ecological justice or \ngentrification - one which sustained the displacement and exclusion of homeless individuals \nfrom urban natures and indeed from policymaking.  Tying in with Swyngedouw\u2019s analysis of \ndepoliticised environments that fail to seriously tackle questions of urban environmental \njustice, it is in precisely these spaces of urban nature that our authors argue for, and begin to \nsketch out, an alternative environmental politics that is built upon a political \u201cspace of \ncontestation for those who have no name or no place\u201d (Swyngedouw, this issue).  \n \n \n \n \n \n 13 \n \n \nReferences  \nAgyeman, J.
