Introduction \n \nApplication of high frequency Acoustic Emission (AE) technique in condition \nmonitoring of rotating machinery has been growing over recent years. This is \nparticularly true for bearing defect diagnosis and seal rubbing [1-5]. The main drawback \nwith the application of the AE technique is the attenuation of the signal and as such the \nAE sensor has to be close to its source. However, it is often practical to place the AE \nsensor on the non-rotating member of the machine, such as the bearing or gearbox \ncasing. Therefore, the AE signal originating from the defective component will suffer \nsevere attenuation before reaching the sensor. Typical frequencies associated with AE \nactivity range from 20 kHz to 1MHz.  \n \nWhilst vibration analysis for gear fault diagnosis is well established, the application of \nAE in this field is still in its infancy. In addition, there are limited publications on \napplication of AE to gear fault diagnosis. Siores et al [6] explored several AE analysis \ntechniques in an attempt to correlate all possible failure modes of a gearbox during its \nuseful life. The gearbox used for this investigation consisted of two spur gear sets of 34 \nand 60 teeth and 45 and 20 teeth respectively. The gears were run-in by operating the \ngearbox at 1200 rpm with full load at four one-hour intervals. Failures such as shaft \nmisalignment, tooth breakage, scuffing and a worn tooth were seeded during tests. \nSiores correlated the various seeded failure modes of the gearbox with the AE \namplitude, r.m.s. standard deviation and duration. It was concluded that the AE results \ncould be correlated to various defect conditions. \n \n 3\nSingh et al [8-9] performed three experiments to study the feasibility of applying AE to \ngear fault diagnosis. The first experiment [8] employed two different gearboxes for \nsimulated gear pit detection. For both test set-ups, the simulated pit was introduced on \nthe pitch line of a gear tooth using an Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) process. \nAn AE sensor with a resonant frequency 280 KHz and an accelerometer for \ncomparative purposes were employed in both test cases. It was important to note that \nboth the accelerometer and AE sensor were placed on the gearbox casing.  \n \nThe first gearbox employed was an UH1H \u201cGenerator Drive Offset Quill\u201d with a gear \nratio of 41:55 and rotational speeds of 1400 and 920 rpm. The simulated pit introduced \nwas 1.25 mm in diameter and depth. It was observed that the AE amplitude increased \nwith increased rotational speed and AE activity was observed with increased pitting. \nThe second gearbox was a back-to-back with gear ratio 42:28 and an input speed of \n1775 rpm. During this test, periodically occurring peaks were observed when natural \npitting started to appear after half an hour of operation. These AE activities increased as \nthe pitting spread over more teeth. Singh et al concluded that AE could provide earlier \ndetection over vibration monitoring for pitting of gears, but noted it could not be \napplicable at extremely high speeds or for unloaded gear conditions. \n \nFor the second experiment, tooth bending tests were carried out using a single tooth \nbending setup. In this test, a sinusoidal load was applied at a frequency of 40Hz. The \nnumber of cycles and the amplitude of the AE signal were monitored and stored in real \ntime until failure occurred.  From this experiment, Singh concluded that AE could \n 4\ndetect crack initiation and growth, while the accelerometer could only detect the crack \ngrowth at a later stage of the crack growth process. \n \nThe final experiment performed by Singh et al [9] involved assessment of the \ntransmissibility of an AE signal within a gearbox. The tests were performed with \ndifferent torque levels using lead pencil breaks to simulate AE activity in the gearbox. \nThis technique is known as the Nielsen source test. Various AE transmission paths were \nexamined. AE sensor was placed on the gear wheel to measure the initial strength of the \nsignature and second sensor was mounted on the ball bearing pedestal to capture the \ntransmitted signal. It was observed that greater attenuation was experienced for lighter \nloads though attenuation remained rather constant at the high load conditions. Singh et \nal concluded that the attenuation across the gearbox was an accumulation of losses \nacross each individual interfaces within the transmission path and the optimum path of \npropagation will be the one with the smallest cumulative loss. \n \nTandon et al. [10] performed an experiment to correlate AE parameters, such as peak \namplitude, ringdown count and energy with gear defect size. The experimental set-up \nemployed a back-to-back gearbox with a gear ratio of 15:16. An AE sensor with \nresonant frequency of 375 KHz and an accelerometer of natural frequency of 39 kHz \nwere employed for this experiment. The tests were performed at a rotational speed of \n1000 rpm under different load conditions. Simulated pits on the pitch-line with constant \ndepth (500\u00b5m) and varying diameters from 250 to 2200\u00b5m were introduced using the \nspark erosion technique. Tandon et al observed that the monitored AE parameters \nincreased with defect size (pit diameter) and load. Tandon et al also concluded that AE \n 5\nhas a better detection capability over vibration since it was able to detect smaller pit \nsizes. \n \nWhilst the details presented above have related to seeded defect identification some \nobservations correlating AE activity to natural pitting have also been reported. Sentoku \n[7] correlated tooth surface damage such as pitting to AE activity. This experiment \nemployed a back-to-back gearbox arrangement (25 to 31 teeth) with a pinion speed of \n992 rpm. An AE sensor of resonant frequency 350 kHz was mounted on the gear wheel. \nThe AE signature was transmitted from the sensor to data acquisition card across a \nmercury slip ring. A strain gauge was mounted on the tooth root to relate the extracted \nAE parameters with the tooth root strain values. It is important to note that this \nexperiment was performed under a constant oil temperature. This eliminated the effect \nof oil film thickness on AE activity. In this experiment, natural pitting occurred at about \n1x106 cycles and it was concluded that AE amplitude and energy increased with \nincreased pitting.  \n \nToutountzakis et al [11] presented some interesting observations of AE activity due to \nmisalignment and natural pitting. The test was performed on a back-to-back gearbox \nwith a spur gear set of 49 and 65 teeth and an the AE sensor used was a resonant type \nplaced on the pinion. A sliver contact air-cooled slip ring was employed to transmit the \nAE signal for further processing. Toutountzakis et al concluded that AE technique \ndemonstrated the potential for gear fault diagnosis. \n \n 6\nAlthough the development of AE in gear diagnosis is in its infancy, the papers reviewed \nhave illustrated the potential and viability of AE becoming a useful diagnostic tool in \ncondition monitoring of gears. However, more detailed investigations are required to \nensure this technique is robust and applicable for operational gearboxes. The purpose of \nthis investigation was to determine an effective AE indicator for seeded gear defect \ndetection. An experimental test-rig was employed that allowed for various sized defects \nto be seeded onto the test gears. \n \n2. Experimental set-up \n \nThe test-rig consisted of two identical oil-bath lubricated gearboxes, connected in back-\nto-back arrangement, see figure 1. The gears employed were made of 045M15 steel \nwithout any heat treatment. The gears (49 and 65 teeth) used had a module of 3 mm, a \npressure angle of 20\u00b0, and surface roughness of between 2-3 \u00b5m. Each gearbox had four \nidentical ball bearings. A simple mechanism that permitted a pair of coupling flanges to \nbe rotated relative to each other, and locked in position, was employed to apply torque \nto the gears. The effect of this process was to twist the shafts and lock in the torque \nwithin the loop of the back-to-back gearbox. The effective torque loading was a \ncombination of the static and dynamic (inertia) loading. Three sets of torque were used \nfor the experiment: 0 Nm, 55 Nm and 110 Nm. The contact ratio of the gear was 1.77.  \nIt must be noted that the 0 Nm condition is not literally \u20180 Nm\u2019. There exists a light load \nat this condition due to the bearing friction and losses\/resistance associated with the \nrubber seals, gear churning and windage. If a true \u20180 Nm\u2019 condition was obtainable, the \ngear would run in a non-linear manner. An AC three-phase electrical motor (1.1 KW) \n 7\nwith speed of 745 rpm was employed to drive the gearbox. The lubricant used was an \nEP SAE 80W-90, GL-4 API mulit-grades gearbox oil so as to keep natural pitting and \nwear to minimum level during the seeded fault tests. \n \n \n \nFigure 1  Test-rig gearboxes in back-to-back arrangement. \n \n3. Sensors and Acquisition Systems \n \nThe AE sensors used for this experiment were broadband type sensors with a relative \nflat response in the region between 100 KHz to 1MHz (Model: WD, \u2018Physical \nAcoustics Corporation\u2019). One sensor was placed on the pinion (49 teeth) and the other \non the bearing casing (figure 2) of the pinion shaft. The cable connecting the sensor \nplaced on the pinion with the pre-amplifier was feed into the shaft and connected to a \nslip rig, see figure 3. This arrangement allowed the AE sensor to be placed as close as \npossible to the gear teeth. Both sensors were held in place with mechanical fixtures. A \n 8\nPH-12 slip rig manufactured by \u2018IDM Electronics Ltd\u2019 was employed. The slip rig used \nsilver contacts and could accommodate up to 12 channels. The slip rig had an air intake \nwhere pressurised air was fed for cooling and cleanliness purposes at a rate of \n0.014kg\/mm2 (figure 3). The output signal from the AE sensors was pre-amplified at \n40dB. The signal output from the pre-amplifier was connected (i.e. via BNC\/coaxial \ncable) directly to a commercial data acquisition card where a sampling rate of 10MHz \nwas used during the tests.  \n \nFigure 2 AE sensors located on the pinion and bearing casing. \n \nSensor \non Gear \nSensor on \nBearing \n 9\n \nFigure 3 Slip ring coupled with cool compressed air supply. \n \n4. Test Procedures \n \nThe gearbox was run-in for more than 15 hours before the actual experiment was carried \nout. Prior to the start of the test, an attenuation test on the gearbox components was \nundertaken in order to understand the characteristics of the test-rig.  \n \nThe test started with a defect free condition so that the operational background noise \ncharacteristics were observed. The gearbox was run for 30 minutes prior to acquiring \nAE data for the no load condition. The gearbox was then shut down to adjust to the next \ntorque level (55 Nm). After another 30 minutes of continuous running, the AE signal for \nthis load condition was acquired.  This procedure was repeated for the load condition of \n110 Nm. \n \nCool Air \nSupply \n 10\nFor the seeded defect condition, a pitch-line defect of 1 mm in diameter (see figure 4) \nwas introduced and AE data was collected by repeating the loading procedures detailed \nin the former paragraph. Lastly, the test was repeated for a large addendum defect \n(extended from the pitch-line) measuring 12 mm by 3 mm (see figure 5). Based on the \nsampling rate of 10 MHz, the acquisition time available for recording was 0.0256 \nseconds which represented 0.31 revolutions (16 teeth) of the pinion at 745 rpm. The \nseeded defects were introduced on the tooth flank of a tooth using an engraving \nmachine. By employing a trigger mechanism, only AE data from the portion of the \npinion gear wheel where the defect was located was acquired. The trigger system was \nset such that the defective gear tooth was at the mid point of the acquisition window \n(0.0256 seconds), see figure 6. \n \nThe application of AE to gear diagnostics is considered to be relatively new. Although \nthere are many AE analysis techniques available, selection of a robust technique is of \nparamount importance if AE is to gain acceptability as a diagnostic tool. The AE \nparameter chosen for the gear defect diagnosis analysis was the root mean square \n(r.m.s), a common AE parameter usually employed for diagnosis.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 11\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4  Seeded small pitch-line defect. \n \n \nFigure 5 Seeded large addendum defect. \n \n \n \n \nIntroduced Pit \n 12\n1     2    3   4   5    6   7   8   9   10  11 12 13 14  15 16  (Teeth Number) \n       A     B        C     D         E \nGear Teeth \nDefective Tooth\n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6 Sectioning of gear teeth for analysis, 16 teeth captured over 0.0256 \nseconds. \n \n5. Attenuation Test \n \nA 0.5 mm diameter and 3 mm length 2H lead pencil was broken at different positions in \norder to establish the attenuation of the AE signal. This technique is known as the \nNielsen source test. Figure 7 presents the schematic diagram for the attenuation test \ndisplaying the different simulation positions and different interfaces the AE signatures \nwould have to propagate across. Table 1 and figure 8 show the relative attenuation \nvalues.  The reference signal employed for the attenuation calculations was the AE \nresponse from a lead break next to the AE sensor on the pinion gear. Five pencil breaks \nwere acquired from each position and averaged. \n \nThe greatest attenuation of simulated AE signatures was observed on the bearing. This \nwas expected due to the number of interfaces the AE signature would need to propagate \nacross. The position of the balls in the loaded zone affects attenuation of the AE signal. \nIf a ball is in the loaded zone while the AE waves were travelling through, better \ntransmissibility can be expected. Relatively high attenuation was also observed for lead \n 13\nbreaks on the wheel (big gear). This was expected as the wheel is furthest away from \nthe sensor; however, the attenuation values of lead breaks on the pinion and shaft were \nsimilar. It was expected that the attenuation would be greater on the shaft due to the \ninterface between the shaft and the pinion gear but this was not the case. This is \nattributed to experimental errors and the close proximity at both locations. \n \n \n \nFigure 7  Schematic Diagram for the attenuation test displaying different \ninterfaces \n \nPencil \nbreaking \nlocations \nWheel \nPinion\nX\u2019 X\u2019 \nBearingShaft\n AE Sensor \n AE Sensor \n 14\n-40\n-35\n-30\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\nBearing Wheel Pinion Shaft\ndB\n \nFigure 8 Relative attenuation values for sensor on the pinion. \n \n \nTable 1 Relative attenuation values \n \nInterface Average Amplitude Relative Attenuation (dB) \nBearing 0.093 -34.64 \nWheel 0.257 -25.90 \nPinion 1.829 -8.86 \nShaft 2.120 -7.58 \n   \nReference Position 5.074 0 \n \n6. Results of operational background noise \n \nFigure 9 displays a typical AE signature with corresponding frequency spectrum \nassociated with a defect free condition (operational noise). Figure 10 illustrates the time \ndomain signatures for the load cases considered. It clearly shows 16 meshing teeth that \n 15\nincluded the defective tooth. This is the first known published document that presents \nthe gear meshing AE transient response in the time domain. The gear mesh frequency \ncan also be calculated from the time domain AE signal by inversing the periodic time \nbetween two subsequent AE bursts. The frequency range of the transient and continuous \nAE signals associated with these tests ranged from 25 kHz to 350 kHz. \n \nFor analysis of AE data obtained from these experiments r.m.s values were calculated to \nprovide a comparison to other published work but principally because of the simplicity \nand proven robustness of this parameter for machine health diagnosis. \n \n \n \nFigure 9  Time and frequency domain of an AE signature showing clearly the \nAE transient response associated with gear meshing of 16 teeth. \n 16\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-2\n0\n2\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n (V\n)\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n (V\n)\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n (V\n)\nTime (seconds)  \nFigure 10 Raw AE signal for small pitch-line defect for (a) no load, \n  (b) 55 Nm load and (c) 110 Nm load. \n \n7. Results of defect simulations \n \nThe recorded AE time waveform acquired for defect and defect free simulations were \nsplit into five different regions with each region representing 3-teeth, see figure 6. The \nr.m.s. value of each region was computed and plotted against the three loading \nconditions. It was thought that this method of grouping the data would enhance the \npossibilities of detecting the seeded defect particularly as the defect has been seeded in \nthe centre of the acquisition window.

For the small pitch-line defect condition, the \ncentre region C, where the seeded defect was introduced, exhibited the highest r.m.s \nvalues (figure 12). However, similar observations were not present for the large \naddendum defect (figure 13). It was also noted that for the small defect condition only \nthe r.m.s levels increased with increasing load. Furthermore, it was observed that r.m.s \nlevels for the large fault condition were relatively lower than defect free and small \ndefect conditions. The latter two had similar r.m.s values. These observations were \nrather puzzling, as the literature to date had advocated an increase in AE r.m.s\/energy \nwith defect size and load. \n 18\nRMS, Small-Defect\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\n0.14\nA B C D E\nRegion\nrm\ns \n(v\n)\n0 Nm\n55 Nm\n110 Nm\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 12 r.m.s. against load for small pitch-line defect condition.

This was a similar procedure to that shown in figure 6. The r.m.s. value of \neach region was computed and plotted against the three load conditions for the small \ndefect condition, see figure 14 and 15. The small defect condition was specially chosen \nas this showed the most promising results when the teeth were grouped in three\u2019s. From \nfigure 14, it was observed that the maximum r.m.s. values did not occur at region D \nwhere the seeded defect was located based on a grouping of two teeth. From figure 15 \nsimilar observations were noted, the r.m.s. value at the seeded fault tooth, H (based on a \nsingle tooth demarcation), was not the highest value. The same observations were noted \nfor the large defect condition. The inconsistency between the single tooth, 2-teeth and 3-\nteeth analysis revealed that either the AE r.m.s or\/and the potential for the AE technique \nfor defect identification was inappropriate. The results would have been conclusive had \nthe r.m.s. levels for the defective tooth been higher than other regions within the \nacquisition window.  \n \nThe raw AE signal from small pitch-line defect is displayed in figure 10. This shows the \nnon-consistent observation of AE bursts in relation to the defect position. The biggest \nburst of the AE signal did not always occur in the centre region of the window where \nthe seed fault was located. Hence, it was not possible to detect the seeded defect using \nthe AE r.m.s. This contradicts the work of a few researchers [8, 10, 11] whom claimed \nAE energy, which is proportional to r.m.s, could clearly identify a simulated pit. Based \non these observations the authors undertook further experiments in an attempt to \nunderstand the reasons for this, see section on discussions. \n 20\n \n \n \nFigure 14   r.m.s  against loads for small pitch-line defect condition.

AE Observations from the Bearing Housing \n \nThe AE sensor on the pinion and bearing casing was synchronised and as such when the \ndata acquisition system was triggered, both AE sensors captured data simultaneously. \n \nDuring the test, it was noted that the AE bursts relating to the gear mesh, as detected on \nthe sensor fixed onto the pinion, were also observed from the sensor on the bearing \ncasing, see figure 16. However, continuous observations of the AE sensor on the \nbearing casing showed intermediate loss of the AE bursts associated with the gear mesh. \nThe reason for this is attributed to the position of the bearing ball\/roller elements during \nrotation. It is postulated that when the ball\/roller is at bottom dead centre, i.e. directly in \nthe load path, transmission of the AE bursts to the sensor on the bearing casing was \nachievable and only under this circumstance. As the relative attenuation ranged from \n44dB to 26dB (depending on the particular gear mesh AE burst, see figure 16), in \naddition to the high probability of loss of transmission path through the bearing, see \nfigure 17, the authors see identifying gear defects from the bearing casing as fraught \nwith difficulties, again contrary to other investigators [6,8].  \n 22\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\nVo\nlts\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-0.06\n-0.04\n-0.02\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\nTime (seconds)\nVo\nlts\nSensor on gear \nSensor on bearing case \n \nFigure 16 AE bursts detected on pinion sensor were observed on bearing  \n  casing sensor, load 55Nm. \n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-0.015\n-0.01\n-0.005\n0\n0.005\n0.01\n0.015\nTime (seconds)\nVo\nlts\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\nVo\nlts\n \nFigure 17   Loss of transmission path at particular gear mesh positions observed \non bearing casing sensor, load 55Nm. \n26dB attenuation 44dB attenuation\n30dB attenuationLoss of transmission through bearing \n 23\n \n9. Discussion \n \nThe relationship between AE r.m.s and defect location presented thus far was \nconsidered unsatisfactory. This resulted in additional tests to explain the discrepancies, \nparticularly as other authors had supported the applicability of these parameters to gear \ndefect detection. These new tests were carried out using the same test set-up but with \nnew gear sets. It was thought prudent to establish if the oil temperature had an influence \non AE activity. For this investigation the AE r.m.s data were monitored and recorded \ncontinuously while oil temperature in the gearbox was also measured at fifteen minute \nintervals. \n \nContinuous AE r.m.s values were calculated in real time by the Analog to Digital \nConverter (ADC) controlling software. This software employed a hardware accelerator \nto perform calculations in real time. The hardware accelerator takes each value from the \nADC and squares it. These results are added into an accumulator for a programmable \ntime interval set by the user, 100 ms in this instance. The accumulator is cleared at the \nstart of the time interval, and the accumulator value will only be stored at the end of the \ntime interval. The r.m.s is then calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the \naccumulated squared ADC readings. The time interval for acquisition was also set at \n100 ms.  \n \nThese additional tests were run at three load conditions until the AE r.m.s. and oil \ntemperatures stabilised. The tests were terminated when the AE parameters and oil \n 24\ntemperatures had been stable for one hour. Stabilisation of the oil temperatures was \nachieved when the temperature remained within 0.20C for the duration of one hour. \n \nFigure 18 illustrates that the gearbox system only reached a stabilised temperature after \nat least 5 hours of continuous running. The starting point for all three test conditions \ninvestigated was dependent on the ambient temperature prior to testing. From figures 19 \nto 21, it was noted that the AE r.m.s varied with time as the gear box reached a \nstabilised temperature. This implied that depending on what time the AE data was \ncaptured for a given speed and load condition, the variation in AE activity r.ms could be \nas much as 33%. For these particular tests the point at which the data was captured is \nhighlighted in figures 19 to 21. Thus, the AE signals captured during seeded defect tests \nwere \u2018snapshots\u2019 that are largely influenced by load, oil temperature and system \ndynamics. As \u2018snapshots\u2019 only provide information at an instant in time, the \nconsistencies of the derived AE parameters will be subject to considerable variation. \nThe influence of load and oil temperature on AE activity is directly linked to the oil film \nthickness between the meshing gears. The oil film thickness will influence the rate of \nwear and asperity deformation, both of which generate the AE activity. Therefore, it is \nimportant to determine and establish when the AE signal should be recorded for usage \non comparative defect analysis.  \n \nThe complications of the effect of oil temperature on AE activity have far reaching \nconsequences, particularly as most of the published work to date has not taken \ncognisance of this effect. The authors of this paper believe it is fundamentally flawed to \ncompare AE activity from defect free and simulated defect conditions under varying \nloads without accounting for the influence of oil temperature. The effect of oil \n 25\ntemperature variation on the generation of AE activity is currently under investigation \nand will be the subject of future publication. It may be worth stating that the influence \nof oil temperature on AE activity for higher rotational speeds has shown far greater \nvariations for similar load conditions than stated in this paper. \n \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nTime (hours)\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n (D\neg\nre\ne \nC\n)\n0 Nm\n55 Nm\n110 Nm\n \nFigure 18  Oil temperatures monitoring with no-load, 55 Nm-load and 110 Nm-\n load conditions. \n \n 26\n0 1 2 3 4 5\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\n0.14\n0.16\nTime (hours)\nr.m\n.s\n (v\nol\nts\n)\n \nFigure 19  Continuous AE r.m.s values for no-load condition. \n \n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\nTime (hours)\nr.m\n.s\n (v\nol\nts\n)\n \nFigure 20  Continuous AE r.m.s values for 55Nm load condition. \n \nAcquisition time for \nthe initial test  \nAcquisition time for \nthe test  \n 27\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\nTime (hours)\nr.m\n.s\n (v\nol\nts\n)\n \nFigure 21  Continuous AE r.m.s values for 110Nm load condition. \n \nTaking cosignance of the fact that AE activity is generated during the sliding and rolling \nof the gears, principally due to asperity contacts, the introduction of a seeded defect \nwhich removes surface material digresses from the basic source of AE generation. \nTherefore the authors argue that identification of seeded defects of this nature cannot be \naccomplished with the AE technique. This statement will hold true if the seeded defect \ninvolved the removal of material from the surface. However, other authors [8, 10, 11] \nhave claimed success and it is argued that the most likely reason for this is as follows: It \nis highly possible that in the process of material removal from the gear face \u2018mounds\u2019 or \n\u2018protrusions\u2019 will be formed at the boundaries of the seeded defect, see figure 22. These \nare created due to the displacement of material from the region of material removal. The \nauthors postulate that it is these \u2018protrusions\u2019 that were responsible for AE activity. \nHowever, this activity will only last until the \u2018protrusions\u2019 are flattened during the \noperation of the gear, see figure 23. In the latter instance, AE will be generated by \nAcquisition time for \nthe test  \n 28\nasperity contacts. These postulations are based on the assumption that a suitable grade \nof lubricant is employed. On this basis the authors question the repeatability of seeded \ndefect identification tests over a prolonged period using the AE technique. \n \nFigure 22 Mounds or Protrusions of the gear surfaces in contact during \nrotation \n \nFigure 23  Flattened protrusions of gear surfaces. \n \nThe pitting process of gears involves initiation of micro-cracks, crack growth and the \nremoval of tiny particles from the gear surface, all of which emit AE activity. \nFlattening of \n\u2018protrusions\u2019 Gear 1 \nGear 2 \nSeeded Defect \nSource of AE activity; material \nprotrusions \nGear 1 \nGear 2 \n 29\nFurthermore, the removed wear particles or debris trapped between mating gear surfaces \nwill create third-body abrasions. This condition will further enhance generation of AE \nsignatures. For a better assessment on the detection capability of AE, it is recommended \nthat experiments are undertaken in conditions, which allow natural pitting or wear rather \nthan seeded defect test.   \n \n10. Conclusion  \n \nThis paper has demonstrated that seeded gear defect detection with AE is fraught with \ndifficulties and the reasons have been presented. This work is part of an ongoing \nprogram which aims to investigate some of the drawbacks detailed and establish if the \ntechnique is relatively robust for natural wear detection on gears. \n \n11.
