Introduction\nTurbulence may be defined as a far-from-equilibrium state of a nonlinear physical system whose\nenergy distribution extends over many degrees of freedom. It takes many different forms, of\nwhich vortex turbulence [1, 2] is probably the best known. A common feature lies in energy\ntransfer between the scale or frequency at which energy from an external source is pumped\ninto the system and a different scale or frequency at which it can be transformed to heat via\ndissipative processes. Turbulence in systems of waves is widespread in nature and technology.\nIt can arise e.g. among phonons in solids [3], in optical fibers and nonlinear optical media [4],\non vibrating plates [5]\u2013[7] and the surfaces of ferrofluids [8, 9], in sound waves in oceanic\nwaveguides [10], as magnetic turbulence in interstellar gases [11], in shock waves in the solar\nwind coupled to the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere [12], in surface waves on liquid hydrogen [13]\nand in second sound in superfluid helium [14, 15]. Typically, there is a cascade-like transfer of\nturbulent energy towards the high frequency domain [14, 16], which is where dissipation mainly\noccurs.\nOf special interest is the application of the wave turbulence (WT) concept to the description\nof energy transfer in superfluid systems far from equilibrium, including disturbed superfluid\n4He [17], nonequilibrium exciton\u2013polariton condensates in a cavity [18, 19] and atomic\nBose\u2013Einstein condensates in a trap [20]. It has been shown theoretically and numerically\n[21, 22] that the evolution of acoustic WT is of key importance in the late stages of condensate\nformation. Although the existing theory can in principle illuminate the nonequilibrium\nproperties of superfluid systems, no experimental studies of turbulent evolution have previously\nbeen reported. The concept of self-similar formation of WT is widely accepted in theory [17, 21,\n23, 24] but, to our knowledge, this prediction has not previously been checked experimentally.\nIn what follows, we report the results of an experiment to study the evolutionary processes\nthat occur during the build-up towards steady-state WT in superfluid 4He, following the initial\napplication of a periodic driving force to excite second sound in a resonant cavity. It was\nestablished earlier that second sound (temperature\u2013entropy waves) provides an ideal model\nsystem for laboratory studies of steady-state wave turbulent phenomena, in particular because\nthe nonlinear wave interactions can readily be adjusted and controlled. Under steady-state\nnonequilibrium conditions, with continuous energy injection and dissipation [14, 15], acoustic\nturbulence is formed whose energy balance is highly nonlocal in K -space, and a direct flux of\nenergy through the spectral scales is established. We now demonstrate that the formation of\nthis turbulent state is self-similar and that, in its initial stages, it is described by power laws for\nNew Journal of Physics 12 (2010) 083047 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n3the amplitudes of the spectral harmonics. The evolution can be understood as a formation front\npropagating in frequency space towards the high frequency domain.\nThe velocity of a second sound traveling wave depends on its amplitude and, to a first\napproximation, can be written as\nu2 = u20 (1 +\u03b1\u03b4T ) , (1)\nwhere \u03b4T is the wave amplitude, u20 is the velocity of a wave of infinitely small amplitude and\n\u03b1 is the nonlinearity coefficient of second sound, which is determined by the relation [25]\n\u03b1 = \u2202\n\u2202T\nln\n(\nu320\nC\nT\n)\n,\nwhere C is the heat capacity per unit mass of liquid helium at constant pressure and T is the\ntemperature.\nThe nonlinearity coefficient \u03b1 may be either positive or negative, depending on the\ntemperature and pressure [25]\u2013[27]. Under saturated vapor pressure (SVP), in the region\nof roton second sound (i.e. at T > 0.9 K), the nonlinearity coefficient is positive (\u03b1 > 0) at\ntemperatures T < T\u03b1 = 1.88 K (like the nonlinearity coefficient of conventional sound waves in\nordinary media), but it is negative (\u03b1 < 0) in the range T\u03b1 < T < T\u03bb. Here, T\u03bb = 2.176 K is the\ntemperature of the superfluid-to-normal (He II to He I) transition. At T = T\u03b1, the nonlinearity\ncoefficient passes through zero. The ease with which \u03b1 can be adjusted (by alteration of T ), and\nthe large values that it can take, make second sound in He II ideal as a test bed for the study of\nnonlinear wave interactions and associated phenomena, including WT.\nThe frequency of second sound depends on its wave vector k as [28]\n\u03c9 = u20k\n[\n1 + \u03bb\u03be 2k2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7] , (2)\nwhere \u03be = \u03be0(1\u2212 T\/T\u03bb)\u22122\/3, \u03be0 \u223c 2\u20133 A and \u03bb\u223c 1. We emphasize that the dispersion of second\nsound is significant within the close vicinity of the superfluid transition (i.e. for T\u03bb\u2212 T < 1\u00b5K),\nbut is very weak in the temperature range T < 2.1 K relevant to the present investigations.\nHowever, the presence of non-zero dispersion is of key importance in the formation of weak\nturbulence in He II. It is well established that if the dispersion is exactly equal to zero, \u2202u20\/\u2202k =\n0, the main mechanism of energy transport through the frequency scales is quite different from\nturbulence and can be associated with shock wave creation [29]. When the dispersion is positive\nbut small, \u2202u20\/\u2202k > 0 (e.g. in the case of second sound in He II, given by equation (2) where\nthe leading nonlinear term is quadratic over the amplitude, see equation (1)), the wave turbulent\nstate is formed in a narrow cone of k-vectors around the direction of propagation of the wave\nwith k= kdrive [16]. The relative phases of waves with k-vectors almost collinear to kdrive (i.e.\nwithin the cone) are random, and a standard kinetic equation for waves can be used to describe\nthe cascade-like, turbulent propagation of energy in the wave system [16, 30]. However, the\ninteraction of waves with non-collinear wave vectors is controlled by higher nonlinear terms\nand is relatively small. That is, wave turbulence in He II is nearly one-dimensional, provided\nthat the dispersion given by equation (2) is weak, i.e. the temperature of the helium bath is\nnot close to T\u03bb. The formation of the wave turbulent regime in He II manifests itself in, for\nexample, fluctuations in the wave field at high frequencies and in the establishment of a near-\nGaussian probability distribution function for second sound wave amplitudes, as was observed\nearlier [31].\nNew Journal of Physics 12 (2010) 083047 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n4In section 2, we describe briefly the experimental arrangements. The results obtained are\npresented in section 3. In section 4, we discuss the results, present a numerical theory and\nconsider the broader implications of this work.\n2. Experimental details\nThe experiments used the second sound resonator described previously [14, 32]: a thin film\nheater capped one end of a cylindrical quartz tube of length `= 7 cm and diameter D = 15 mm.\nThe other end was capped by a superconducting bolometer, whose transition temperature\ncould be adjusted by changing an external magnetic field. The He II inside the cell was held\nunder its saturated vapor pressure at a temperature of T = 2.08 K, where (T\u03bb\u2212 T )\/T\u03bb = 0.041.\nThe temperature signal from the bolometer was recorded by a digital oscilloscope and then\ntransferred to a computer for analysis. The quality of the resonator reached Q \u223c 3000 at\nthe higher resonance numbers (N > 10) but was less at lower resonances, behavior that is\nunderstandable in terms of losses due to normal fluid motion in the boundary layer next to\nthe wall.\n3. Experimental results\nFigure 1(a) plots a typical evolution envelope following the step-like application of a resonant\nperiodic drive to the heater under conditions such that there is no inverse energy cascade [15].\nThe standing wave in \u03b4T evolves nonmonotonically and often (as here) exhibits asymmetry. At\nearly times, after switching on the drive, only a response at the driving frequency is evident,\nas shown by the power spectral density plotted in figure 1(b), corresponding to arrow-b in\nfigure 1(a). Some time later, the direct energy cascade has become established in the low\nfrequency domain, whereas the wave amplitude at high frequency remains close to zero, e.g.\nharmonics are formed only up to \u03c9\/2pi < 20 kHz in figure 1(c). At later times, the cascade is\nfully formed up to \u223c 80 kHz, as shown in figure 1(d), corresponding to arrow-d in figure 1(a).\nWe now examine how the harmonics of the driving force evolve with time by analysis of\nthe heights of the Fourier spikes labeled 1\u20135 in figure 1(d). The set of results plotted in figure 2\ncorresponds to the time domain signal shown in figure 1(a). It is immediately evident that\neach of the harmonic amplitudes grows initially according to a power law, undergoes shallow\noscillations and finally flattens out as the steady state is approached. It is also clear that the\ncorresponding power-law exponents at early times increase with the harmonic number n and\nthat the higher harmonics develop after short delays.\n4. Discussion and theory\nTo try to account for these phenomena, we apply the numerical model used earlier [14] for the\ncomputation of steady-state spectra. Energy balance is governed by\ni\n\u2202bn\n\u2202t\n=\n\u2211\nn1,n2\nVn,n1,n2(bn1bn2\u03b4n\u2212n1\u2212n2 + 2bn1b\u2217n2\u03b4n1\u2212n2\u2212n)\u2212 i\u03b3nbn + Fd, (3)\nwhere bn(t)= (1\/2)(B\u22121n Sn + iBn\u03b2n) is the time-dependent canonical amplitude of second\nsound at the nth resonant frequency fn; Sn and \u03b2n are the space Fourier components\nNew Journal of Physics 12 (2010) 083047 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n5Figure 1.

The steady-state spectrum established at large times, i.e. after all\ntransient processes are finished at tform > 5, is shown in figures 3(a) by circles. Figure 3(a) also\ndemonstrates the evolution of the spectrum during the build-up process, similar to that observed\nin the experiments (figures 1(b)\u2013(d)).\nFigure 3(b) shows the dependence on time of the amplitude of the wave at the driving\nfrequency and of two higher harmonics computed for the evolution presented in figure 3(a).

Lines: dependences |An| \u221d t2n\u22121. The\ncomputations were for Fd = 1.\nis evident that the dependences of the wave amplitudes on time during the formation process\nt < 2 are well described by a power-law function,\n|An| \u221d tm, (4)\nwhere m = 2n\u2212 1. We see also that the characteristic formation time is tform \u223c 5.\nWe can account for the observed dependence (4) analytically within the framework of the\nmodel (3). It is evident from figure 3(b) that, at small times t \u001c tform, the wave amplitude is also\nsmall. During this era, it is the wave at the driving frequency that has the largest amplitude.\nWe may therefore reduce the whole set of equation (3) to a simpler form dA1\/dt = Fd,\ndAn\/dt = Vn,1,n\u22121 A1 An\u22121 (n > 1). We neglect dissipation, which has a negligible effect early in\nNew Journal of Physics 12 (2010) 083047 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n7the growth process. The reduced equations imply that the wave at the driving frequency, n = 1,\ngrows mainly due to interaction with the driving force, and the evolution of each n > 1 harmonic\nis defined by the interaction with its left-hand side neighbor, An\u22121, and with the fundamental\nwave, A1. From the reduced equations, one finds A1 = Fd\u00d7 t for n = 1 and An = V\u02dcn Fnd t (2n\u22121),\nwhere V\u02dcn = (1\/(2n\u2212 1)!!)5nk=2Vk,1,k\u22121 for n > 1 and !! signifies a double-factorial. The result\nobtained clearly agrees well with the numerical computations (figures 3(b) and equation (4)).\nThe exponents m = 2n\u2212 1 are universal and do not depend on the value of the nonlinearity\ncoefficient (at Vk,l,m \u221d \u03b1 6= 0) or on the driving amplitude Fd. The model is valid for small\nt \u001c tform.\nThe results from the numerical model compare well with those from the experiments.\nIn both cases, the initial growth in spectral amplitude takes the form of a power law whose\nexponent grows with increasing harmonic number n. For n = 1, 2, the measured exponents\nagree within experimental error with the values of 1 and 3 predicted by equation (4). For\nlarger n, the experimental exponents still increase with n, but the agreement becomes only\nqualitative. We comment, however, that such discrepancies are to be expected, because at larger\ntimes when the low-frequency harmonics are not small with respect to their equilibrium values,\nnonlinear interactions other than those taken into account in the reduced equations start playing\nan essential role.\nTo analyze the details of the turbulence build-up process at larger t , we suppose that\nformation is self-similar with a finite formation time t\u2217 (i.e. of the explosion type for WT [16],\ncorresponding to the case of a finite capacity spectrum [33]). In agreement with general\nrecommendations [16, 17, 33], in this case the harmonic amplitude at frequency \u03c9, time t , can be\nestimated as A(\u03c9, t)= (t\u2217\u2212 t)q f (\u03be), where \u03be = \u03c9(t\u2217\u2212 t)p is the self-similar variable, f is a\nuniversal function that describes the evolution of the wave spectrum in the course of the build-up\nprocess, and q and p are positive exponents. The f function obeys the boundary conditions [16]\nf \u221d \u03be\u2212s at \u03be \u001c 1 and f \u03be s \u2192 0 at \u03be \u001d 1, where s \u2248 1 is close to the Kolmogorov index of the\nsteady-state turbulent spectrum taken with opposite sign [14, 33]. (The indices also satisfy the\nrelation q = sp, to ensure the steady-state character of the spectrum formed for \u03be \u001c 1; see\nbelow.) According to the boundary conditions, in the low frequency domain \u03be \u001c 1, a spectrum\nA\u03c9 \u221d \u03c9\u2212s is formed, and in the high frequency domain \u03be \u001d 1, the harmonic amplitudes are\nclose to zero. At the characteristic transition frequency between the two domains, \u03c9f, one has\n\u03be \u223c 1 [17]. As a result, the transient process can be understood as the propagation of a formation\nfront in frequency space from low to high frequencies, whose position at time t is\n\u03c9f = const\u00d7 (t\u2217\u2212 t)\u2212p. (5)\nThis conclusion agrees with the experimental observations shown in figure 1 and in the\nnumerical simulations of figure 3(a). For example, the position of the front at t = 0.66 s is\nmarked by an arrow in figure 1(c). (Note that under experimental conditions the cascade is\nrestricted at a high frequency \u03c9b due to viscosity [14], hence the dependence (5) is only valid at\n\u03c9f < \u03c9b.)\nTo capture the details of the front propagation, we plot in figure 4 the characteristic delay\ntime of harmonic formation as a function of n for the first 12 harmonics. The formation delay\n1tn is defined as the interval between the application of the driving force at ton and the time\ntn when the nth harmonic rises from the common noise floor. The formation delay of the\nfundamental wave, n = 1, is negligible. The steady growth of tn with n in figure 4 corresponds\nto the finite propagation velocity of the front, d\u03c9f(t)\/dt , in agreement with equation (5). It\nNew Journal of Physics 12 (2010) 083047 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n8Figure 4. Experimental formation delays 1tn for the 31st resonance with\nW = 30.0 mW cm\u22122 (filled squares) and for the 15th resonance with W =\n58.8 mW cm\u22122 (open lozenges). The dashed and full curves are least-squares\nfits of equation (6) with C = 0.331 and 0.613 s, respectively, for p = 5.0.\nfollows from (5) that the difference between the formation times of the nth and 1st harmonics\nis equal to tn \u2212 t1 = const\u00d7 (\u03c9\u22121\/p1 \u2212\u03c9\u22121\/pn ). Noting that the frequency of the nth harmonic is\n\u03c9n = n\u00d7\u03c91, one obtains\n1tn = tn \u2212 ton = C \u00d7 (1\u2212 n\u22121\/p), (6)\nwhere C is a constant of the order of tform. The experimental points in figure 4 can be closely\nfitted by (6) (curves) for p = 5.0. Thus the experimental data are well described by the self-\nsimilar dependence (6).\n5. Conclusions\nWe have reported the first experimental study of the processes involved in the creation of steady-\nstate acoustic turbulence in a superfluid system. In the main, the results are well described by\na numerical model, although there are points of detail that are not captured. These include\nthe damped oscillations seen in the spectral amplitudes as the steady state is approached, and\ndiscrepancies in the measured and calculated power-law exponents describing the initial growth\nfor n > 3. Up to intermediate times, the build-up of turbulence is well described by the self-\nsimilar model (5). These same considerations should also be applicable to the other systems\ndescribed in the Introduction for which, however, the experimental conditions and parameters\nare in many cases much harder to control.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful for valuable discussions with E A Kuznetsov, V Lebedev and A A Levchenko.\nThis work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (UK),\nby the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, by the Presidium of the Russian Academy of\nSciences under the program \u2018Fundamental Problems of Nonlinear Dynamics\u2019 and by the Royal\nSociety of London.\nNew Journal of Physics 12 (2010) 083047 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n9References\n[1] Tritton D J 1988 Physical Fluid Dynamics 2nd edn (Oxford: Clarendon)\n[2] Davidson P A 2004 Turbulence: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers (Oxford: Oxford University\nPress)\n[3] Tsoi V S 2003 Transverse electron focusing as a way of studying phonon kinetics turbulence of phonon flow\nCentral Eur.
