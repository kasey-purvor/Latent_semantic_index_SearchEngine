This leads to the multiplet\nstructures that can be elegantly described by the SU(3) group of flavor symmetry. The\nmasses of hadrons are then related to the constituent masses of the quarks and simple\nrelations among them are found. For instance, the non-strange \u03c1 and \u03c9 vector mesons, both\nmade out of up and down quarks, have roughly the same mass, whereas the \u03c6, being a pure\nss state has a mass approximately 300 MeV heavier. Furthermore, the mass of a meson like\nthe \u03c1, made of two constituent quarks, is about 2\/3 of the mass of a proton or a neutron,\nmade of three such quarks. However, the simple and successful picture that the quark model\ndelivers does not apply to the scalar meson sector: apparently scalars are different. First of\nall there are far more scalar mesons than can be accomodated in one conventional nonet,\nmoreover their masses turn out to be hundreds of MeV lighter than one would simply deduce\nfrom the constituent structure of the mesons.\nIn Ref. [1], Tornqvist presented a model in which the central focus is to consider the loop\ncontributions given by the hadronic intermediate states that each meson can access: it is via\nthese hadronic loops that the bare states become \u201cdressed\u201d and, in the case of scalar mesons,\nhadronic loop contributions totally dominate the dynamics of the process. He shows that\nthe mass shift, which is a direct consequence of the presence of strongly coupled hadronic\nintermediate states, is so dramatic that it completely spoils the one\u2013to\u2013one correspondence\nbetween the resonances we observe and the underlying constituent structure. Though we\nfollow Tornqvist\u2019s modelling quite closely, very similar models have been considered by van\nBeveren et al. [2], Geiger and Isgur [3] and by Oller and Oset [4] among others.\nIn this paper, following and extending the method of Tornqvist and Roos [5], we will in-\nvestigate the possibility of generating, in the scalar sector, more than one state with the\nsame quantum numbers, by initially inserting only one \u201cbare seed\u201d. We will show that the\noutcome depends on the kinematics of the intermediate channels: crucially, on the number\nand position of each threshold opening and on the strength of their individual couplings.\nTherefore, every case has to be considered separately and it is not possible to reach one\ncommon conclusion for all the members of the scalar meson family.\n1\n2 The model of hadronic dressing\nWe start by considering a simple model in which all bare meson states belong to ideally\nmixed quark multiplets. We call nn the nonstrange light state and suppose that substituting\na strange quark for a light one increases the mass of the state by \u2206ms \u2243 150 MeV.\nThe bare propagator for each of these bound states will be of the form\nP =\n1\nM20 \u2212 s\n, (1)\nwith a pole on the real axis, corresponding to a non decaying state; for example for the\nvector I = 0 state\n|\u03c6\u30090 = |ss\u3009.\nIf we now assume that the experimentally observed hadrons are obtained from the bare\nstates (nn, sn, ss, ...) by dressing them with hadronic interactions, the propagator becomes\nP (s) =\n1\nM2(s)\u2212 s\u2212 iM(s) \u0393(s) , (2)\nwhere a sum over all hadronic interactions (in the loop) is implicit (see Fig. 1). The pole\nthen moves in the complex s-plane. The corresponding vector state can be decomposed as\n|\u03c6\u3009 =\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u01eb2|ss\u3009+ \u01eb1|KK\u3009+ \u01eb2|\u03c1\u03c0\u3009+ ... (3)\nwhere calculation would give \u01eb2 = |\u01eb1|2+|\u01eb2|2+...\u226a 1. The hadronic loop contributions allow\nthe bare states (ss in this example) to communicate with all hadronic channels permitted\nby quantum numbers, and this enables the meson to decay, its lifetime being inversely\nproportional to the width \u0393. However, in this case the switching on of interactions produces\na relatively tiny effect and the physical \u03c6 is still overwhelmingly an ss state. For this reason\nthe naive quark model works very well; so from the observed hadron we can easily infer its\nquark structure. A similar picture works for the tensors.\nFor scalar mesons the situation is different and the one\u2013to\u2013one correspondence between\nthe observed scalar mesons and their underlying quark content is distorted by dynamical\neffects. This is because they couple strongly to more than one meson-meson channel, creating\noverlapping and interfering resonance structures. Furthermore, since the interactions are\nS\u2013waves, the opening of each threshold produces a more dramatic s-dependence in the\n-1\n= --\n-1\nFigure 1: Pictorial representation of the full propagator in Eq. (2).\n2\npropagator. At each threshold, there is a centrifugal barrier factor of kL, where k is the\nappropriate c.m. 3-momentum of the decaying products and L their relative orbital angular\nmomentum. This means that the thresholds for higher spin states open more smoothly.\nLet us now go into more detail about the model starting, for simplicity, from the case in\nwhich only one underlying bare state has to be considered. This is the case, for example, for\nthe I = 1\/2 and I = 1 sectors, the seeds of which are sn and nn respectively. We define a\nvacuum polarization function \u03a0(s) which accounts for all the possible two pseudoscalar loop\ncontributions to the propagator P (s) [1]. Referring to the pictorial representation of Eq. (2)\nin Fig. 1, we can easily write \u03a0\u2019s imaginary part:\nIm\u03a0(s) = \u2212\n\u2211\ni\nG2i (s) = \u2212\n\u2211\ni\ng2i\nki(s)\u221a\ns\n(s\u2212 sA,i)F 2i (s) \u03b8(s\u2212 sth,i) (4)\nwhere the index i runs over the pseudoscalar channels and the ki\u2019s are the c.m. momenta\nof the two intermediate pseudoscalars. The gi\u2019s are the SU(3) flavour couplings connecting\nthe bare state to the two\u2013pseudoscalar loop: gi = \u03b3\u03b3i, see Refs. [1, 6] for more details. The\nterms (s\u2212 sA,i) give the Adler zeros, required for S\u2013waves by chiral dynamics. Fi(s) are the\nform factors, which take into account the fact that the interaction is not pointlike but has a\nspatial extension.\nSince the vacuum polarization function, \u03a0(s), is an analytic function, its real part can be\ndeduced from the imaginary part by making use of a dispersion relation\nRe\u03a0(s) =\n1\n\u03c0\nP\n\u222b \u221e\nsth,1\nds\u2032\nIm\u03a0(s\u2032)\ns\u2032 \u2212 s . (5)\nNo subtraction is needed, since the form factors are built in such a way that they decrease\nfast enough when |s| \u2192 \u221e.\nAt this point, we can write the propagator in terms of the vacuum polarization function:\nP (s) =\n1\nm20 +\u03a0(s)\u2212 s\n(6)\nThe mass and the width of the decaying hadron are determined, in a process independent\nway, by the pole of the propagator. Consequently, in order to find the pole position, we have\nto continue Eqs. (4, 5, 6) into the complex s\u2013plane onto the appropriate unphysical sheets.\nThe contribution of this resonance pole to the i\u2192 j amplitude is then\nAij(s) =\nGi(s)Gj(s)\nm20 +\u03a0(s)\u2212 s\n. (7)\nwhich respects the unitarity requirement, A \u2212 A\u2020 = 2i AA\u2020. As a consequence, for each\nelastic channel we can define a resonant phase-shift by\nAii(s) =\n1\n2i\n(\n\u03b7i e\n2i\u03b4i \u2212 1) . (8)\n3\nThe amplitude Aij in Eq. (7) represents a generalization of the well-known Breit-Wigner\nformula, at least in the neighbourhood of the pole. This is readily seen by writing the\nvacuum polarization function in terms of its real and imaginary parts, then\nAij(s) =\nGi(s)Gj(s)\nm20 +Re\u03a0(s)\u2212 s + iIm\u03a0(s)\n=\nmR[\u0393i(s)\u0393j(s)]\n1\/2\nm2(s)\u2212 s\u2212 imR\u0393tot(s) , (9)\nhaving identified\n\u0393tot(s) = \u2212Im\u03a0(s)\nmR\n=\n\u2211\ni\n\u0393i(s) , (10)\nwhere\n\u0393i(s) =\nG2i (s)\nmR\n, (11)\nand\nm2(s) = m20 +Re\u03a0(s) . (12)\nHere m2(s) is the running squared mass, given by the sum of the bare mass squared and the\nreal part of the vacuum polarization function Re\u03a0(s), which is responsible for the mass shift.\nThe imaginary part of the vacuum polarization function Im\u03a0(s) is directly proportional\nto the width of the state. The mass shift function Re\u03a0(s) is generally negative and is\napproximately constant only in the energy regions far from any threshold. For S\u2013waves the\ns\u2013dependence becomes crucially important nearby thresholds, since Re\u03a0(s) has square root\ncusps at the opening of each of them.\nThough the only correct way to calculate the mass of a particle is to find the position of the\npropagator pole in the complex s\u2013plane, it is useful to define another quantity, again obtain-\nable from the propagator, which we will call the Breit\u2013Wigner mass mBW . It corresponds\nto the intersection of the running mass m2(s) with the curve s, i.e. the particular value of\ns where the function (m20 +Re\u03a0(s)\u2212 s) vanishes, with s wholly real:\nm2BW = m\n2\n0 +Re\u03a0(m\n2\nBW ) . (13)\nThis gives a rough estimate of what the physical mass is. As a matter of fact, moving into the\ncomplex plane the real coordinate of the pole position can change considerably if thresholds\nto strongly coupled channels are located nearby, and when the dynamics are particularly\ncomplicated. As mBW of Eq. (13) is defined as the energy at which the function m\n2(s) is\nequal to s, this is a point that we refer to as a crossing for reasons that will become clear in\nFig. 2. Clearly at\n\u221a\ns = mBW , the amplitudes Aij of Eq. (9) become purely imaginary. It is\nthis simple fact and its physical consequences that are the theme of this paper.\n4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\nE (GeV)\n\u03a0\nIm\n   \n (s\n)\nm\n2 (s\n)\npi\u03b7 KK- pi\u03b7,\nFigure 2: The curvesm2(s), s and Im\u03a0(s) as functions of the energy E =\n\u221a\ns, for the sector I = 1. Each\nintersection between m2(s) and s is referred to as a crossing. The first of these is situated at approximately\n915 MeV, between the pi\u03b7 and the KK threshold. The second crossing, well above the pi\u03b7\u2032 threshold, is\nat E = 1430 MeV. The third intersection, at 1.82 GeV, is a non-physical state according to the Wigner\ncondition.\n3 I = 1 sector and the role of the Wigner condition\nWe now turn our attention to the issue of accomodating all the scalar meson states (which\nexperiments deliver) in either one or more quark model multiplets. In Ref. [1] Tornqvist\nfinds a scalar nonet composed of the K\u22170(1430), the a0(980), the f0(980) and the f0(1370).\nFurthermore, in Ref. [5], one extra low energy pole is found, which the authors identify with\nthe much discussed broad \u03c3 meson, called f0(400 \u2212 1200) in the Particle Data Tables [7].\nNevertheless, this study leaves out the a0(1430), for instance, for which Crystal Barrel [8]\nfinds clear evidence.\nConsequently, we begin by examining the I = 1 sector, since this is relatively simpler than\nthe others. We ask: can we \u201cgenerate\u201d one or more extra physical states in the same sector,\nin the framework of our simple model, by starting from only one nn bare seed ?\nBy increasing the overall coupling \u03b3 and the bare mass of the nn seed (\u03b3 = 1.53, m0 = 1.620\nGeV, as opposed to \u03b3 = 1.13, m0 = 1.420 GeV used in Ref. [1]), we find it is possible to\nobtain a scenario in which more than one intersection between the mass function m2(s) and\nthe s curve appear in the mass plot, as shown in Fig. 2 (upper half). The first crossing,\nsituated at approximately 915 MeV, between the \u03c0\u03b7 and the KK threshold, corresponds to\na state which can be identified with the a0(980). We treat the charged and neutral kaons as\ndegenerate in mass and so neglect the possibility of isospin mixing between I = 1 and I = 0\n5\n050\n100\n150\n200\n0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\u03b4\nE (GeV)\npi\u03b7 KK- pi\u03b7,\npi\n\u03b7\n*\n(de\ngre\nes)\n-10\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\u03b4\nE (GeV)\npi\u03b7,\npi\n\u03b7,\n* *(de\ngre\nes)\nFigure 3: The phase \u03b4pi\u03b7 reaches 90o at E = 915 MeV, corresponding to the first physical state identified\nwith the a0(980) (the point is labelled by a star on the left hand plot).

The second crossing, occurring well above the \u03c0\u03b7\u2032 threshold, at mBW = 1430\nMeV, is again a physical state and has the right features to represent the Crystal Barrel\nrelatively broad a0(1450); the third intersection occurs at E = 1.82 GeV. In the lower half of\nFig. 2 we plot the curve Im\u03a0(s), which shows how the second state which we identify with\nthe a0(1450) is much broader than the a0(980).\nTo know which state is physical we refer to the Wigner condition [10]. This condition follows\nfrom the principle of causality, i.e. the requirement that the scattered wave does not leave\nthe scatterer before the incident wave has reached it. In the present context, Wigner\u2019s\ntheorem limits the rate of fall of the phase-shift, \u03b4ij. A physical resonance cannot occur if\nthe phase shift falls through 90o. In fact, such a resonance would have a negative width\nand correspond to a pole on the upper half plane in the physical sheet. It would therefore\nrepresent a non-causal, exponentially increasing state. Since it is not possible to have a state\nwith a lifetime greater than the period of scattering, Wigner\u2019s condition requires\nd\u03b4\ndk\n\u2265 \u2212 1\nmpi\n\u221a\ns\n2k\n. (14)\nwhere the phase-shift \u03b4 refers to the same channel as the c.m. 3-momentum k and is defined\nby Eq. (8). The Wigner condition is particularly useful in the inelastic region, where reso-\nnances do not necessarily correspond to \u03b4 = 90o, but more generally occur when \u03b4 = n\u03c0\/2\nand the real part of the scattering amplitude is zero.\nFig. 3 shows the phases, \u03b4pi\u03b7 and \u03b4pi\u03b7\u2032 , which tell us about the characteristics of the states we\nfind: \u03b4pi\u03b7 goes through 90\no at E = 915 MeV, in correspondence with the first physical reso-\n6\n00.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n-0.4 -0.2 0 0.2 0.4\nIm\n A\n   \n  (G\neV\n)\nRe A     (GeV)pi\u03b7\npi\n\u03b7\nKK-\nK\u03b7,\n*\n*\n*\n0.915\n1.430\n1.820\nFigure 4: Argand plot of the amplitude Api\u03b7: in the elastic region, ImApi\u03b7 raises quickly anti-clockwise\nand ReApi\u03b7 reaches zero at E = 915 MeV, the lighter physical a0.

Notice that the heavy unphysical state is situated immediately after an abrupt change\nof direction in the curve ImApi\u03b7.\nOur conclusions about yet heavier states are not reliable in the present model, since higher\nthresholds are not included which may well affect the picture at higher energies dramatically.\nNevertheless just including the lightest two pseudoscalar channels we can definitely say that\na scenario in which not only one but a series of scalar physical states with I=1 can easily be\nachieved, by fine tuning key free parameters of the model.\nGenerating more than one physical state with the same quantum number starting from one\nseed brings us closer to the picture emerging from experiment. Will this be the case for the\nother sectors as well ? And to what extent is the adjustment of the overall coupling and\nmass parameters permitted within this model? That is what we discuss in the following\nSections.\n7\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\nE (GeV)\n\u03a0\nIm\n   \n (s\n)\nm\n2 (s\n)\npiK K\u03b7,\nFigure 5: The curves m2(s), s = E2 and Im\u03a0(s) as functions of the energy E. The first crossing point\nis located below the Kpi threshold and corresponds to a pole on the real axis (i.e. a non-decaying state).\nThe second crossing is again an unphysical state because it does not satisfy the Wigner condition, as clearly\nshown by the phase shift and the Argand plot in Figs. 6 and 7. On the contrary, the third intersection point\ncorresponds to an unphysical state. Finally the last two crossings correspond to a non-physical and a heavier\nand broader physical state respectively.\n4 The I = 1\/2 sector\nIn an analogous manner to the I = 1 case, we now want to examine the possibility of\ndynamically generating more physical states with the same quantum numbers from only one\nbare seed, ns in this particular case. Here the main issue is to investigate whether it is\npossible to generate the light I = 1\/2 state called \u03ba, advocated for example in Refs. [2,4,11].\nThe situation for the I = 1\/2 sector is rather different from the I = 1 case. Here there are\nonly two relevant thresholds and their positions and coupling strengths are such that the\nshape of the mass function curve, m2(s), is very rigid and varying the parameters changes\nthis little. Nevertheless, by using the same changes we used for the I = 1 sector (\u03b3 = 1.53,\nm0 = 1.620 GeV, with sA,piK = \u22121.0 GeV2) we obtain the plot shown in Fig 5.\nThe first interesting observation is that the first point of intersection between the mass\nfunction m2(s) and the curve s, is always bound to be below the K\u03c0 threshold and it\ncorresponds to a pole on the real axis, i.e. to a state with zero width: in fact, the cusp\nsignals the precise location of the threshold itself, so that varying the coupling strength\nonly slightly alters the position of the crossing point, but never allows it to move above\nthe threshold. The second intersection point is not a physical state since it violates the\n8\nWigner condition, as is clearly shown by the phase shift and the Argand plot in Figs. 6 and\n7. Notice once again that the conclusion that this state is not physical does not depend on\nthe strength of the coupling to the K\u03c0 channel: varying this only produces a tiny shift in\nthe position of the crossing point, and does not alter the characteristics of the state. Thus\nwithin this model having just one ns bare seed, it turns out to be impossible to generate\na physical \u03ba-like state. In contrast, the third intersection point corresponds to a physical\nstate which can easily be interpreted as the K\u22170 (1430), already found in Tornqvist results of\nRef. [1]. It is interesting to notice that the same kind of picture would emerge when using the\nparameterization proposed in Ref. [5]: the first crossing point is again below threshold and\nthe second one corresponds to a state which, violating the Wigner condition, is unphysical.\nIndeed, only the third intersection point is a physical one.\nMoving to higher energies, we find two further crossing points between the s = E2 curve and\nthe mass function m(s)2: according to the Wigner condition, only the last one, situated at\nE = 1.96 GeV, corresponds to a physical state. As we mentioned in the previous Section,\nresults concerning states with heavy masses are not completely reliable since the present\nmodel does not include higher meson-meson thresholds. Nevertheless, it is quite interesting\nto notice that the last physical state predicted by our calculation could be identified with\nthe K\u22170 (1950) reported by the PDG group (see table on p. 51 of Ref. [7]).\nCompared with other results available in the literature, as far as the I = 1\/2 and I = 1\nsectors are concerned, ours are similar to those presented in the work of Minkowski and\nOchs [12], where they claim the existence of two complete nonets in the light scalar meson\nspectrum, the first one characterised by the K\u22170 (1430) and the a0(980), and the second one\nby the K\u22170(1950) and the a0(1450). To the isoscalar sector they assign the f0(980), f0(1500)\nand the f0(1720), f0(2020) respectively, with singlet-octet mixing angle (much as in the\npseudoscalar nonet), having dismissed the \u03c3 and the f0(1370).\nIn contrast, van Beveren et al. [2] find two lower mass nonets, given by\n\u03ba, a0(980), f0(980), \u03c3\nK\u22170(1430), a0(1450), f0(1370), f0(1500) ,\nwhereas Shakin and collaborators [13] predict the existence of up to three scalar nonets,\ncharacterized by\na0(980), K\n\u2217\n0(1430)\na0(1450), K\n\u2217\n0 (1730)\na0(1857), K\n\u2217\n0 (1950)\nand keep the \u03c3 and \u03ba mesons out, using their particular definition of \u201cdynamically generated\nstates\u201d with no right to be classified into a nonet structure. Moreover the a0(1857) and\nthe K\u22170(1730) are resonances which appear in their calculation but are not confirmed by\nexperiment yet.\nTo complete our picture we now move to the I = 0 sector.\n9\n050\n100\n150\n200\n0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n\u03b4 pi\nE (GeV)\nK\npiK K\u03b7,\n* *\n(de\ngre\nes)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2\n\u03b4 \u03b7\n,\nE (GeV)\nK\n\u03b7,K\n* *\n(de\ngre\nes)\nFigure 6: The phase \u03b4Kpi drops extremely quickly through 90o at E = 670 MeV, in correspondence with\nthe unphysical state generated by the second crossing point in Fig. 5.

The following unphysical and physical states, with BW\nmasses of 1.66 and 1.96 GeV respectively, are situated in the inelastic region, well over the K\u03b7\u2032 threshold,\nand are also indicated on the plot by little stars.\n10\n5 The I = 0 sector\nThis is the most complex and delicate sector, and drawing any kind of conclusion is particu-\nlarly difficult: let\u2019s see why. As discussed in the previous Sections, in the I = 1 and I = 1\/2\nsectors physical states originate from one \u201cbare seed\u201d only, either nn or ns, and are then\n\u201cdressed\u201d by coupling to meson-meson channels. In contrast, in the I = 0 case we already\nhave two possible \u201cbare seeds\u201d to start with, nn and ss, which not only get dressed but in\nfact do mix through hadronic loops. And mixing entangles the situation to such an extent\nthat the one\u2013to\u2013one correspondence between the phase shift behaviour and the occurrence of\nphysical states is lost: then the Wigner condition cannot be used to sort the physical states\nfrom the unphysical ones. Moreover, the couplings of the isoscalar bare seeds to the relative\nmeson-meson channels, \u03c0\u03c0, KK, \u03b7\u03b7 etc ... are not calculated in a standard and unique way:\nthere are several calculations in the literature, each of which is based on different (but in our\nopinion equally good or bad) assumptions (see for example Refs. [1] and [2]). So one has to\nmake a choice of coupling scheme as well, and unfortunately the outcome strongly depends\non this choice.\nIf we simply use for the parameters \u03b3 and m0 the same values as in Sections 3 and 4 and the\ncoupling scheme as given by Tornqvist in Ref. [1] (with the \u03b7\u03b7\u2032 threshold coupling enhanced\nby a factor \u03b2 = 1.6) or by van Beveren et al. [2], we find scenarios in which multiple crossings\ndo occur and many isoscalar states are generated. Unfortunately, we cannot tell them apart,\nbecause the phase shift behaviour does not help, especially in the region around and above 1\nGeV, where the mixing is maximal and the overlapping among resonances is crucial. And we\ncannot say which of them are physical states either, because the Wigner condition cannot\nbe applied. Moreover, as we anticipated, the position and features of the crossing points\nare very strongly model dependent, and very different scenarios can be created by varying\nthe coupling scheme, so that no robust model independent conclusion can be reached in\nthis sector. For instance, if we apply purely SU(3) pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar couplings, as\npresented in Refs. [1, 6] without enhancing the \u03b7\u03b7\u2032 threshold, only two resonant states are\nfound.\nNevertheless, it is a fact that a number of states larger than two can be created starting from\njust two bare seeds. For certain parameter configurations and with certain coupling schemes,\nthe I = 0 experimental candidates can be accounted for. This shows that the dynamical\ngeneration of physical states is a possible solution to the problem of accounting for more\nscalar mesons than can fit in one nonet. Notice, though, that this is a \u201cdemocratic\u201d model,\nin which we cannot distinguish which are the intrinsic (or pre-existing) states as opposed to\nthe dynamically generated ones (a discussion about this issue was raised by van Beveren et\nal. in a comment [15] on a paper by Shakin and Wang [16]).\n11\n6 Scattering amplitudes\nTo what extent are we free to change the parameters of the model to allow the double crossing\nto occur that generates the a0(1430) as well as the a0(980)? This question is addressed\nby considering the relationship of the propagators in Eqs. (1,2,6,7) to the corresponding\nphysical scattering amplitudes. As noted in Section 2, knowing the propagator of s\u2212channel\nresonances determines a key part of the scattering amplitudes, Eqs. (7,9). For Tornqvist\nand Roos, this amplitude Aij is all there is to the hadronic scattering amplitude. However,\ns\u2212channel dynamics is not all that controls the scattering. So while the amplitude A defined\nin Eq. (7) respects unitarity, it is not the most general amplitude that achieves this, having\nits numerator and denominator related by the same couplings Gi (see Eq. (4)). Knowing\nthe structure of the propagator P (s), Eq. (6), we can write in complete generality the full\nscattering amplitude as\nT (s) =\nN(s)\nm2(s)\u2212 s+\u03a0(s) , (15)\nwhere we drop the channel labels ij. The numerator N(s) is an unknown complex function\nof the variable s, which can be re\u2013expressed in terms of its modulus and phase as\nN(s) = |N(s)| ei\u03b1(s) . (16)\nImposing both elastic and inelastic unitarity one finds that\n|N(s)| = [m2(s)\u2212 s+Re\u03a0(s)] sin\u03b1(s)\u2212 Im\u03a0(s)ei \u03b1(s) , (17)\nwhich allows the most general hadronic amplitude to be written as\nT (s) = A(s) e 2i \u03b1(s) + sin\u03b1(s) e i \u03b1(s) (18)\nwhere \u03b1(s) is an unknown function of s real along the right hand cut, and the second term\nin Eq. (18) can be regarded as a background contribution. It is important to note that if the\nphase-shift of the amplitude A is \u03c9, then the phase-shift of the full amplitude T is \u03b4 = \u03c9+\u03b1.\nThe model of Tornqvist and Roos is to set \u03b1 = 0 everywhere.\nIn Ref. [17] we have improved on Tornqvist\u2019s study by performing new fits to experimental\ndata, based on the general amplitude T (s) rather than the pole dominated amplitude A(s).\nFrom this we conclude that very good solutions can be obtained by using relatively small\nvalues for the parameter \u03b1 (we chose a constant value of 15o as an example) and varying\nthe m0 and \u03b3 parameters by a few hundred MeV. For instance, to fit \u03c0K scattering data\nin terms of the pure pole amplitude A, Tornqvist requires the position of the Adler zero\nto be at sA,piK = \u22120.42 GeV2 far from its position in chiral perturbation theory (current\nalgebra predicts (mK \u2212mpi)2 \u2264 sA,piK \u2264 (mK +mpi)2 with an average value of 0.24 GeV2).\nIn contrast, by a simple choice of \u03b1 of about 150 we can fit these same data with the full\nhadronic amplitude T which has the Adler zero at the position required by chiral dynamics.\n12\nThis puts our attempts to generate extra states with the same quantum numbers by varying\nthe free parameters of the model on more solid ground. We know that small changes in the\nvalue of m0 and \u03b3 can give equally good fits using the full hadronic amplitudes, T . This gives\nus confidence in our general conclusions. The fact that there is more to a scattering process\nthan s\u2212channel dynamics means that fitting data along the real axis cannot accurately\ndetermine the true pole position of a broad state without an analytic continuation, or a\nvery specific model. This casts doubt on the determination of the position of the \u03c3\u2212pole by\nTornqvist and Roos. Their fit to \u03c0\u03c0 data in terms of the amplitude A gives quite different\nparameters than using the full amplitude T of Eq. (18). That there is more to dynamics\nthan s-channel resonances has been noted by Isgur and Speth in this same context [18].\n7 Conclusions\nThe present work focusses on the study of the I = 1 and I = 1\/2 sector of the light scalar\nmeson spectroscopy. Previous papers from Tornqvist and Roos [1,5] seemed to suggest that\nusing a simple model based on the hadronic \u201cdressing\u201d of bare seeds, one could generate\nmore than one, possibly a whole family of mesons, with the same quantum numbers, starting\nwith one bare seed only. This is certainly a very interesting possibility, since we know that\nexperiment has detected many more light scalar mesons that can be accomodated in one\nnonet. We started by investigating the I = 1 sector, where two strong candidates have been\nfound: the long known a0(980) and the heavier a0(1450), detected by the Crystal Barrel\ncollaboration [19]. By slightly increasing two crucial parameters of the model, the overall\ncoupling \u03b3 and the bare mass m0, we have shown that it is possible to find a picture in\nwhich both states can easily be generated starting from one bare nn seed only. Due to the\nstructure of the vacuum polarization function, the heavier of the two states is automatically\nbroader than the lighter one. Drawing conclusions on further, heavier states would require\ndetailed treatment of heavier thresholds, which are not included here.\nEncouraged by these results we then moved to the I = 1\/2 sector, to try and see whether we\ncould also give a legitimate place to the controversial \u03ba meson. Due to the nature of the ns\ncouplings to pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar channels, it turns out to be impossible to generate\nsuch a light I = 1\/2 scalar meson in our framework. Further heavier states can be generated,\none of which has the right features to be identified with the K\u22170 (1430), whereas the others\nmight only be an artifact of the poor treatment of heavy thresholds in the model. Again,\nonly a more rigorous description of such heavier thresholds could enable us to rule out their\nexistence or not.\nTo complete the study, we considered the I = 0 sector: even though the heavily structured\ndynamics of the isoscalars make any clear\u2013cut result far from robust, at least in the framework\nof our simple model, we can conclude that the multiple crossing mechanism is certainly active\nin this sector as well, and that dynamical generation of many states with the same quantum\n13\nnumbers but different masses can be a plausible explanation of the experimental occurence\nof many more 0++ states that can fit in one quark\u2013model nonet.\nWe conclude that the detailed pole parameters of Ref. [5] are strongly model dependent, as\npreviously suggested by the comments of Refs. [18].\nAs opposed to the work in Ref. [16], we cannot tell which are intrinsic states and which\nare dynamically generated, nor can we state that we have definitely found enough strong\ncandidates to complete two full nonets as in Refs. [2, 12]: we can find no way to produce\nthe light \u03ba meson and no precise assignment can be made for the isoscalar sector. As far as\nthe isovector and isodoublet states are concerned, our picture is similar to that of Ref. [12],\nwith the occurrence of two a0 and two K\n\u2217\n0 physical states and the possibility to produce a\nnumber of f0\u2019s, depending on the coupling scheme.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported in part under the EU-TMR Programme, Contract No. CT98-0169,\nEuroDA\u03a6NE.\nReferences\n[1] N.A.
