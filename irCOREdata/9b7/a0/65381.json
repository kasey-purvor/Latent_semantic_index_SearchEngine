Introduction \n \nSuppose an industry contains 100 price-taking firms, which face identical input-\noutput price configurations.  Suppose further 50 of these firms choose the net \noutput vector x  under some price vector p , while the remaining 50 choose x\u2032  \n(say, because their technology is different).  Then a natural way to model \naggregate industry output is in terms of a stochastic supply function (SSF), which \nstipulates a choice of x  and x\u2032 , each with probability 21 , under p .  Analogously, \nwhen a competitive firm faces technology shocks governed by some exogenous \nstochastic process, its supply behavior can be modeled in terms of an SSF.  Thus, \nfor example, suppose the technology set available to some firm producing wheat \nis \u03c4  if it snows at the beginning of the crop cycle, and \u03c4 \u2032  otherwise.  Given some \nprice vector p , the firm chooses the net output vector x  if its realized (available) \ntechnology is \u03c4 ; it chooses x\u2032  otherwise.  The probability of snowfall is 21 .  Then \nthe supply of this firm can be modeled in terms of the SSF outlined earlier.  Both \nsituations turn up routinely in applications of the theory of competitive firm \nbehavior.1 \n What kind of minimal, intuitive a priori restriction would ensure that an \nSSF satisfies analogues of the empirical content of the traditional theory of \ncompetitive firm behavior?  The classical theory of firm behavior posits that the \noutput-input choices of a competitive firm, summarized by a deterministic supply \nfunction (DSF), satisfy the Weak Axiom of Profit Maximization (WAPM).  \nWAPM implies the familiar Supply Inequality, which in turn yields the law of \nsupply.  For a firm\u2019s choices to be rationalizable in terms of profit-maximization \nwith respect to some collection of feasible input-output combinations, it is \nnecessary and sufficient that its DSF satisfy WAPM.2  Thus, predictions regarding \ncompetitive supply behavior, whether at the firm level or at the industry level, are \nderived from WAPM.  Once firms are permitted to violate WAPM, the classical \ntheory fails to generate any empirical content whatsoever.   \n                                                          \n1  The first situation, for example, is commonly considered in applied studies of competitive \nindustry behavior and efficiency measurement, stemming from the seminal theoretical work of \nDebreu (1951) and Farrell (1957).  These contexts have given rise to a large microeconometric \nliterature on stochastic production frontier estimation (see, for example, Kumbhakar and Lovell, \n2000).  In macroeconomics, the literature on real business cycles flowing from Kydland and \nPrescott (1982) routinely models firm technology as subject to stochastic shocks. \n2  See Section 2 for formal definitions.  Samuelson (1947) introduced WAPM and the Supply \nInequality, showed that the former implies the latter (and thereby, the law of supply), and noted \nthat WAPM is necessary for profit maximization.  See also Debreu (1959, p. 47).  Hanoch and \nRothschild (1972) showed that WAPM is sufficient for a firm\u2019s choices to be rationalizable in \nterms of profit-maximization with reference to some technology set.  The name, WAPM, is due to \nVarian (1984). \n \n1\nDasgupta: Supply Theory\nPublished by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2009\nViolations of WAPM appear to be frequently encountered in empirical \nstudies.  It has been argued that large departures from the profit maximization \nhypothesis, and, indeed, from maximizing behavior per se, are in fact routine in \nreality.3   \nIn a well-known response, Becker (1962) argued that, even if individual \nfirms do not maximize profits, the law of supply may hold in the aggregate as a \nmarket-wide phenomenon.  An extension of his claim suggests that, in contexts \nwith stochastic firm technology, the law of supply may also hold in the aggregate \nas a firm-level phenomenon even if the firm does not maximize profits with \nrespect to its realized technology.  Becker however based his case on examples.  \nHe did not provide general non-profit-maximizing behavioral foundations that \nwould prove both necessary and sufficient for the empirical content of the \ntraditional theory (as summarized by the Supply Inequality), to hold as an \naggregate phenomenon.  Recently, Dasgupta (2005) has posited a consistency \nrestriction for a DSF which is weaker than WAPM, yet implies the Supply \nInequality.  However, Dasgupta left unexamined the connection between this \nrestriction and aggregate supply behavior.   \nRegardless of whether an SSF provides an aggregate representation of the \nsupply behavior of multiple price-taking firms with deterministic (but possibly \ndifferent) technologies, or of a single competitive firm endowed with a stochastic \ntechnology, what kind of minimal, intuitively plausible, a priori consistency \nrestriction can one posit for SSFs, that would imply aggregate supply behavior \nbroadly in consonance with the classical (deterministic) theory?  Would such a \nnecessary and sufficient consistency restriction on the aggregate SSF \nrepresentation be compatible with violation of WAPM by every underlying \nconstituent DSF?  Furthermore, would this restriction be compatible even with \nviolation of the condition in Dasgupta (2005) by all underlying DSFs?  If so, the \nempirical content of the classical theory (i.e. the Supply Inequality), suitably \nreinterpreted, would prove robust both: (i) as a market-wide phenomenon even \nwhen no individual firm exhibits choices that can be rationalized in terms of \nprofit-maximization, and (ii) as a firm-level phenomenon even when the firm\u2019s \nchoices on the basis of its realized technology set invariably violates profit-\nmaximization.  Such an analysis would provide a general axiomatic foundation \nfor a complete de-linkage between the empirical content of the classical theory of \ncompetitive firm behavior and the assumption of profit maximization, while \n                                                          \n3  See, for example, Leibenstein (1976, 1979, 1983) and Simon (1979).  Varian (1985) provides a \nformal treatment of the notion of a \u2018large\u2019 violation in this context.  Public sector firms are often \nactively prevented from maximizing profits, in pursuance of other public objectives, even though \nthey are price-takers in some competitive markets and face politically determined prices in others.  \n\u2018Firms\u2019 in our usage also includes foundations and other private non-profit organizations which \nare small enough to be reasonably thought of as price-takers. \n \n2\nThe B.E. Journal of Theoretical Economics, Vol. 9 [2009], Iss. 1 (Contributions), Art. 26\nhttp:\/\/www.bepress.com\/bejte\/vol9\/iss1\/art26\nsubsuming both the analysis by Dasgupta and the traditional, WAPM-based \ntheory, as special cases.  Thus, it would identify the exact sense in which \u201c\u2026 anti-\nmarginalists can believe that firms are irrational, marginalists that market \nresponses are rational, and both can be talking about the same economic world\u201d \n(Becker, 1962: p.12). \nThis paper offers such an analysis.  Furthermore, we show that the \nempirical content of the classical theory (i.e. a general formulation of the Supply \nInequality) can be derived from an a priori behavioral restriction with \nindependent intuitive appeal that does not presuppose even cost minimization.   \nSection 2 introduces the basic notation and definitions.  In particular, we \nintroduce our notion of a stochastic supply function and discuss how it can be \nused as an aggregate analytical representation of a finite class of deterministic \nsupply functions.  Section 3 introduces our a priori consistency postulate for \nSSFs, which we term stochastic consistency, and discusses its properties.  We \nshow that the aggregate SSF representation of a finite class of DSFs may satisfy \nstochastic consistency even if no underlying DSF can be rationalized in terms of \nprofit maximization (nor satisfy cost minimization).  Our consistency postulate \nmay hold even if all underlying DSFs violate the consistency restriction proposed \nby Dasgupta.  Thus, stochastic consistency completely delinks firm behavior from \nprofit-maximization.  We then introduce a general probabilistic expansion of the \nclassical Supply Inequality, which is equivalent to our stochastic consistency.  \nExisting results in the deterministic framework, such as the relationship between \nWAPM and the Supply Inequality and the equivalence between Dasgupta\u2019s \ncondition and the Supply Inequality, turn out to be special cases of this general \nequivalence.  Our general equivalence condition also yields a probabilistic version \nof the law of supply, from which the traditional version falls out as a special case.  \nSection 4 concludes. Detailed proofs are presented in the Appendix. \n \n2.  Notation and preliminaries \n \nLet n be the number of commodities and let { }nN ,...2,1= .  Let \u211c  and ++\u211c  \ndenote, respectively, the set of real numbers and that of positive real numbers.  A \ncompetitive firm faces n-dimensional vectors of commodity prices and produces \nn-tuples of net outputs.  We shall denote price vectors by pp \u2032,  etc. and net output \nvectors by xx \u2032,  etc.  The set of all possible price vectors is n++\u211c .  Given a net \noutput vector x , ix  will denote the amount of the thi \u2212  commodity contained in \nx .  Given a price vector ,p ip  will denote the price of the thi \u2212  commodity.  We \nshall denote the power set (i.e., the set of all possible subsets) of n\u211c  by ( )n\u211c\u03c0 .  \nGiven any finite set \u03a9 , \u03a9  will denote the number of elements in \u03a9 . \n3\nDasgupta: Supply Theory\nPublished by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2009\nDefinition 2.1.  A stochastic supply function (SSF) is a rule s, which \nspecifies, for every np ++\u211c\u2208 , exactly one finitely additive probability measure t \non ( n\u211c , ( )n\u211c\u03c0 ) ( n\u211c  being the set of outcomes and ( )n\u211c\u03c0  being the relevant \nalgebra in n\u211c ). \n  \nGiven an SSF, s, let ( )pst = , and let A be a subset of n\u211c .  Then ( )At  \nrepresents the probability a net output vector will be chosen from the set A, under \nthe price vector p.    \n \nDefinition 2.2.  A deterministic supply function (DSF) is a rule S, which \nspecifies, for every np ++\u211c\u2208 , exactly one element of n\u211c . \n \nGiven a DSF, S, and given any price vector p , ( )pS  is the net output \nvector (uniquely) chosen.  A DSF can evidently be identified with a degenerate \nSSF.4  \nAn SSF may be used as an analytical construct to aggregate deterministic \nsupply behavior by m competitive firms, represented by m (possibly different) \nDSFs, all facing the same price vector, p.  Group (industry) supply can be \nmodeled via a \u2018representative\u2019 competitive firm facing p and choosing according \nto an SSF such that, for any subset A of n\u211c , the probability of choosing a net \noutput vector from A is simply the proportion of firms who do so.  \n \nDefinition 2.3.  For all { }mMj ,...,1=\u2208 , let jS  be a given DSF ( mSS ,...,1  \nneed not all be distinct).  We say that an SSF, s, aggregates mSS ,...,1  iff, for \nevery np ++\u211c\u2208 , and every nA \u211c\u2286 , [ ( ) ( ){ }m\nApSMi\nAt i\n\u2208\u2208= | ], where  ( )pst = . \n \nAn SSF may also represent supply behavior of a single competitive firm \nsubject to technology shocks.  The intuitive interpretation here is that there exists \na given m-tuple of technology sets (collections of feasible net output vectors), say \nmGG ,...,1 .  If jG  happened to be the technology set actually facing the firm, the \nfirm would choose according to some DSF jS .  Given a price vector p , some \nexogenous process (\u2018nature\u2019) randomly determines which technology set is \n                                                          \n4  An SSF, s, is degenerate iff, for every np ++\u211c\u2208 , there exists nx \u211c\u2208  such that { }( ) 1=xt , \nwhere ( )pst = .  \n \n4\nThe B.E. Journal of Theoretical Economics, Vol. 9 [2009], Iss. 1 (Contributions), Art. 26\nhttp:\/\/www.bepress.com\/bejte\/vol9\/iss1\/art26\nrealized:  the firm subsequently chooses according to the corresponding DSF.  \nThe probability that any technology set jG  will be realized is m1 , but since \nmGG ,...,1  need not all be distinct, two distinct DSFs may have different \nprobabilities of realization. \nWe now summarize, for later reference, the classical theory of competitive \nfirm behavior. \n  \nDefinition 2.4.  A DSF, S, satisfies the Weak Axiom of Profit \nMaximization (WAPM) iff, for every ordered pair of price vectors pp \u2032, , \n( )[ ]0\u2265\u2032\u2212 xxp , where ( ) ( )pSxpSx \u2032=\u2032= , . \n  \nWAPM requires that, if a competitive firm happens to choose some net \noutput vector x  when faced with the price vector p, then it cannot choose any net \noutput vector under another price situation which would give it a higher profit \nunder p.  The firm\u2019s supply function, S, can be rationalized, i.e. interpreted, as \nbeing driven by the goal of profit-maximization, if one can construct a set of net \noutput vectors, say \u0393 , such that, if the firm\u2019s technology set was indeed \u0393 , and it \nwished to maximize its profit, then it would be able to do so by choosing \naccording to S.5  A closed and convex set n\u211c\u2286\u0393  exists which rationalizes S in \nterms of profit maximization if, and only if, S satisfies WAPM.6   \n \n3.  Stochastic consistency and the law of supply \n \nWe now introduce our consistency restriction for an SSF.  Let nx \u211c\u2208\u2217  be an \narbitrary net output vector, and suppose the price vector changes from some initial \nsituation p  to p\u2032 .  Consider the collection of all net output vectors whose \nattractiveness relative to the reference vector \u2217x  does not decline due to the price \nchange.  This is the set of all net output vectors which continue to yield at least as \nmuch profit (or as low a loss) relative to \u2217x , despite the price change.  Thus, this \ncollection consists of all nx \u211c\u2208  which satisfy [ ( ) ( )\u2217\u2217 \u2212\u2265\u2212\u2032 xxpxxp ].  It seems \nreasonable to require that a net output vector be chosen from this collection at \nleast as frequently as earlier: the price shift has not reduced the attractiveness of \nits members.  Thus, the probability that a net output vector is chosen from this set \n                                                          \n5  A DSF, S, is rationalizable in terms of profit maximization with respect to a technology set iff \nthere exists some n\u211c\u2286\u0393  such that, for all np ++\u211c\u2208 , (i) ( ) \u0393\u2208pS , and (ii) ( )[ ][ ]\u0393\u2208\u2032\u2032\u2265 vallforvpppS .  The set \u0393  is said to rationalize S in terms of profit \nmaximization.  \n6  See Varian (1984).  \n5\nDasgupta: Supply Theory\nPublished by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2009\nshould not decline.  An analogous condition should hold for the set of net output \nvectors which are made strictly more attractive by the price shift.7   \n \nDefinition 3.1.  An SSF, s, satisfies stochastic consistency iff, for every \npair of price vectors pp \u2032, , and for every nx \u211c\u2208\u2217 :  \n ( ) ( ){ }( ) ( ) ( ){ }( )\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217 \u2212\u2265\u2212\u2032\u211c\u2208\u2265\u2212\u2265\u2212\u2032\u211c\u2208\u2032 xxpxxpxtxxpxxpxt nn || , (1) \nand \n         ( ) ( ){ }( ) ( ) ( ){ }( )\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217 \u2212>\u2212\u2032\u211c\u2208\u2265\u2212>\u2212\u2032\u211c\u2208\u2032 xxpxxpxtxxpxxpxt nn || . (2) \n \nwhere ( )pst =  and ( )pst \u2032=\u2032 . \n \nStochastic consistency is the probabilistic analogue of a restriction on an \nindividual firm\u2019s deterministic supply behavior, introduced by Dasgupta (2005), \nwhich we term \u2018consistency\u2019 here.  Suppose the firm chooses, respectively, the net \noutput vectors xx \u2032~,~ , under pp \u2032, .  Suppose further that, by choosing x~  instead of \nthe feasible alternative x \u2032~  under p , the firm loses some amount, say $10.  \nConsistency requires that the loss entailed by the choice of x~  instead of x \u2032~  under \np\u2032  must be at least $10 (since otherwise, intuitively, a consistent firm should \nhave persisted with x~  under p\u2032 , instead of switching to x \u2032~ ). \n \nDefinition 3.2.

Journal of Theoretical Economics, Vol. 9 [2009], Iss. 1 (Contributions), Art. 26\nhttp:\/\/www.bepress.com\/bejte\/vol9\/iss1\/art26\nDasgupta has shown that, for a DSF, consistency is weaker than WAPM \n(recall Definitions 3.2 and 2.4 and note Example 3.7 below).  By Observation 3.3, \nthe following relationship thus holds between WAPM and stochastic consistency \nfor a degenerate SSF. \n \nObservation 3.4.   \n(i)  A degenerate SSF, s, may satisfy stochastic consistency even if the DSF \ncorresponding to s violates WAPM. \n(ii)  If a DSF, S, satisfies WAPM, then the degenerate SSF corresponding to S \nmust satisfy stochastic consistency.   \n \nWhen an SSF aggregates a finite class of DSFs (recall Definition 2.3), \nstochastic consistency turns out to be a weaker restriction than the condition that \nthe constituent DSFs all individually satisfy consistency.   \n \nLemma 3.5.  Let { }mM ,...,1=  be a given finite set, 1\u2265M .   \n(i) For every m-tuple of DSFs mSS ,..,1  such that [for all Mj \u2208 , jS  \nsatisfies consistency], the SSF aggregating mSS ,..,1  satisfies stochastic \nconsistency.  \n(ii) For all 2\u2265m , there exists an m-tuple of DSFs mSS ,..,1  such that: [for \nevery Mj \u2208 , jS  violates consistency], but the SSF aggregating mSS ,..,1  \nsatisfies stochastic consistency. \nProof:  See the Appendix. \n \nRecall now that, for a DSF, WAPM necessarily implies consistency; but a \nDSF may satisfy consistency, yet violate WAPM (see Example 3.7 below).  In \nlight of this, Lemma 3.5 immediately yields the following. \n \nProposition 3.6.  Let { }mM ,...,1=  be a given finite set, 1\u2265M .   \n(i) For every m-tuple of DSFs mSS ,..,1  such that [for all Mj \u2208 , jS  \nsatisfies WAPM], the SSF aggregating mSS ,..,1  satisfies stochastic consistency.  \n(ii) There exists an m-tuple of DSFs, mSS ,..,1 , such that: [for every Mj \u2208 , \njS  violates WAPM], but the SSF aggregating mSS ,..,1  satisfies stochastic \nconsistency. \n \nProposition 3.6 summarizes our central finding.  Proposition 3.6(ii) brings \ninto focus the disconnect between profit maximization and stochastic consistency: \n7\nDasgupta: Supply Theory\nPublished by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2009\nthe aggregate SSF representation may satisfy stochastic consistency even if not a \nsingle underlying DSF can be rationalized via profit-maximization.  Thus, given \nany finite collection of DSFs, stochastic consistency for their aggregate SSF \nrepresentation is weaker than the requirement that all constituent DSFs be \nrationalizable in terms of profit maximization.  \n Our framework takes, as its theoretical prior, a given finite collection of \nDSFs, and derives an SSF as its aggregate representation.  This seems the natural \nmodeling approach in the case of aggregation over a collection of competitive \nfirms.  In the case of an SSF that models supply behavior of an individual firm \nsubject to stochastic technology shocks, in some empirical contexts, the \nunderlying collection of alternative DSFs over which \u2018nature\u2019 randomizes may \nnot be directly observable.  Proposition 3.6(ii) implies that one can have a given \nprior collection of DSFs, all of whom violate WAPM, yet whose aggregate SSF \nrepresentation satisfies stochastic consistency.  But, given an SSF, s, satisfying \nstochastic consistency, does there necessarily exist some m-tuple of DSFs, at least \none of whom satisfies WAPM, and whose aggregate representation is s ? \nThe following example shows that even this is not the case.  An SSF,s , may \nsatisfy stochastic consistency, yet every possible finite collection of DSFs that \nyields s as its aggregate representation may exhibit violation of WAPM by all its \nconstituents.  Thus, an SSF may satisfy stochastic consistency even when it is \ncompletely impervious to ex post rationalization in terms of profit-maximization. \n \nExample 3.7.  Let s be an SSF specified as follows: for all np ++\u211c\u2208 , \n[ ( ){ }( ) ( ){ }( )\n2\n10,...,0,2,10,...,0,1,1 =\u2212=\u2212 tt  if 12 \u2265p ; and \n( ){ }( ) ( ){ }( )\n2\n10,...,0,4,10,...,0,3,1 =\u2212=\u2212 tt  if 12 <p ], where ( )pst = .  The SSF s \nsatisfies stochastic consistency.  Nonetheless, any m-tuple of DSFs that s can be \nsaid to aggregate must exhibit violation of WAPM (and satisfaction of \nconsistency) by all its constituents.                                                                                                                \n \nRemark 3.8.  The example above also shows that an SSF may satisfy \nstochastic consistency, yet its constituent DSFs may all violate cost-minimization.  \nFurthermore, an SSF may satisfy stochastic consistency even when it is \ninconsistent with any collection of DSFs satisfying cost-minimization. \n \nAn SSF, s, satisfies stochastic consistency whenever there exists at least one \nm-tuple of DSFs that s can be said to aggregate, all of whose members \nindividually satisfy consistency (Lemma 3.5(i)).  Intuitively, economizing on \ninput use when input prices are high, but not when they are low, does not appear \n8\nThe B.E. Journal of Theoretical Economics, Vol. 9 [2009], Iss. 1 (Contributions), Art. 26\nhttp:\/\/www.bepress.com\/bejte\/vol9\/iss1\/art26\nintrinsically contradictory, even though this entails losses in the latter situation.  \nX-efficiency analyses of firm behavior, for example, often highlight cases where \nfirms improve their technical efficiency in response to a rise in input costs.  \nEvidently, every member of any m-tuple of DSFs that the SSF in Example 3.7 can \nbe said to aggregate must exhibit this feature.  Consistency permits such internally \ncoherent loss-making behavior, WAPM rules it out.  In essence, it is this \ndifference between the two conditions that Example 3.7 exploits.8     \nWe now specify a probabilistic analogue of the deterministic Supply \nInequality, which summarizes the main empirical content of the classical theory \nof competitive firm behavior. \n \nDefinition 3.9.  An SSF, s, satisfies stochastic supply inequality iff, for \nevery pair of price vectors pp \u2032, , and for every \u211c\u2208z :  \n ( ){ }( ) ( ){ }( )zxppxtzxppxt nn \u2265\u2212\u2032\u211c\u2208\u2265\u2265\u2212\u2032\u211c\u2208\u2032 || ,                            (4) \nand  ( ){ }( ) ( ){ }( )zxppxtzxppxt nn >\u2212\u2032\u211c\u2208\u2265>\u2212\u2032\u211c\u2208\u2032 || ;                            (5) \n \nwhere ( )pst =  and ( )pst \u2032=\u2032 . \n \nLet z  be any arbitrary real number, and suppose the price vector changes \nfrom some initial situation p  to p\u2032 .  Consider the collection of all net output \nvectors whose profitability increases by at least z  due to the price change.  \nStochastic supply inequality requires that the probability of choosing from this \ncollection should not fall under p\u2032 .  An analogous requirement should also hold \nwith regard to the collection of all net output vectors whose profitability increases \nby more than z .   \nIt can be checked that stochastic supply inequality is equivalent to \nstochastic consistency.  This general equivalence evidently subsumes the \nequivalence of consistency and supply inequality for the deterministic \n                                                          \n8  Satisfaction of stochastic consistency by an SSF, s, is necessary to ensure the existence of some \nfinite collection of DSFs that yields s as its aggregate representation, while exhibiting satisfaction \nof consistency by all its constituents (recall Lemma 3.5(i)).  But is it also sufficient?  This \nimportant question appears open at this stage.  Given any pair of price vectors pp \u2032, , and an \nSSF, s, satisfying stochastic consistency, there must exist an m-tuple of DSFs, whose aggregate \nrepresentation is s, and whose members all individually satisfy (3) for pp \u2032, .  But does there \nnecessarily exist at least one such m-tuple, whose members all individually satisfy (3) for every \nother possible pair of price vectors as well?  We have been unable to resolve this issue so far. \n \n9\nDasgupta: Supply Theory\nPublished by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2009\n(degenerate) special case.  Furthermore, in light of this general equivalence, \nstochastic consistency yields a probabilistic expansion of the law of supply, which \nsubsumes the traditional, deterministic, version.   \nSuppose the price of a commodity rises, all other prices remaining \ninvariant.  Our (stochastic dominance) formulation of the law of supply requires \nthat, for every real number \u03b2 , neither the probability of producing at least \u03b2  \namount of the commodity, nor the probability of producing more than \u03b2  amount \nof the commodity, should decrease.   \n \nNotation 3.10.

Concluding remarks \n \nThis paper extends and completes a line of investigation initiated by Becker \n(1962) and continued by Dasgupta (2005), which argued that the primary \nempirical\/predictive content of the traditional theory of competitive firm behavior \ncan be delinked from its behavioral presumption of profit-maximization.  Our \nanalysis provides a necessary and sufficient axiomatic foundation for such de-\n10\nThe B.E. Journal of Theoretical Economics, Vol. 9 [2009], Iss. 1 (Contributions), Art. 26\nhttp:\/\/www.bepress.com\/bejte\/vol9\/iss1\/art26\nlinkage, while subsuming both the contribution of Dasgupta and the traditional, \nWAPM-based theory as special cases.9   \nWe have utilized the analytical construct of a stochastic supply function to \nprovide an aggregate representation of a finite class of standard deterministic \nsupply functions.  We have introduced an intuitively plausible consistency \npostulate for a stochastic supply function that may be satisfied even if no \nunderlying deterministic supply function is open to rationalization in terms of \nprofit maximization (nor, indeed, satisfies cost-minimization).  In this sense, our \nconsistency postulate provides a complete conceptual departure from the \ntraditional presumption of profit-maximization.  Despite this departure, our \nconsistency postulate turns out to be equivalent to a stochastic analogue of the \ndeterministic condition of supply inequality, which summarizes the predictive \ncontent of the traditional theory of competitive firm behavior.  This finding \nprovides the central equivalence in the theory of competitive firm behavior, in that \na number of results in the deterministic theory follow as special cases.  In \nparticular, it yields a probabilistic version of the law of supply, which implies the \ntraditional specification.  It is difficult to see how a theory of supply with any \napplicability can afford to dispense with the law of supply, at least in its \nprobabilistic version.  In this sense, our analysis also appears to set the conceptual \nlimits beyond which the behavioral presumptions of the traditional theory cannot \nbe substantively relaxed without seriously undermining its predictive import. \n  If not profit, exactly what is the objective function (if any) that a \ncompetitive firm need maximize to satisfy our consistency condition?  In other \nwords, can one characterize some objective function, maximization of which over \nprobabilistic convex technology sets would provide a necessary and sufficient \nrationalization of firm choice behavior that satisfies our stochastic consistency?  \nWould such an objective function be open to intuitive interpretation?   These \nquestions, which relate to a preference-based counterpart of the choice-based \ntheory of competitive supply developed in this paper, suggest themselves as \nuseful candidates for future investigations.   \n \nAppendix \n \nProof of Observation 3.3.   \nFirst consider a degenerate SSF, s, satisfying stochastic consistency.
