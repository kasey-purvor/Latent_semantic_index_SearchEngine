Like \nprevious cases [4, 5], our patient (I.G.) was quite unable to open her handgrip \nappropriately when directly reaching out to pick up objects of different sizes. \nWhen first tested she failed to do this even when she had previewed the target \nobject 5 sec earlier. Yet despite this deficit in \u2018real\u2019 grasping, we found, counter-\nintuitively, that I.G. showed good grip scaling when \u2018pantomiming\u2019 a grasp for \nan object seen earlier, but no longer present. We then found that after practice, \nI.G. became able to scale her handgrip when grasping a real target object that \nshe had previewed earlier. By interposing catch trials where a different object \nwas covertly substituted for the original object during the delay between preview \nand grasp, we found that I.G. was now using memorized visual information to \ncalibrate her real grasping movements. These results provide new evidence that \n\u2018off-line\u2019 visuomotor guidance can be provided by networks independent of the \nPPC.  \n \n 3\nResults \n \nExperiment 1 \nIn the first test session, I.G. performed three different tasks in the following order: (a) \nperceptual matching; (b) delayed real grasping; (c) delayed \u2018pantomimed\u2019 grasping. \nThe perceptual task required the patient to make a simple manual size estimate using \nher forefinger and thumb. The two delayed grasping tasks were based on methods \ndevised by Goodale and colleagues [6]. In the case of pantomimed grasping, the \nsubject was required to delay grasping the object for 5 sec \u2013 during which the object \nwas removed \u2013 and then to pretend to grasp it (see Figure 1). In the delayed \u2018real\u2019 \ngrasping task, the object remained present during and after the delay, so that visual \ninformation remained available \u2018on-line\u2019 to guide the grasping action. This task was \nused for comparison because it more closely resembles the time-course of the \npantomime-grasping task than does a straightforward immediate grasping task.  \n \nThe results are shown in Figure 2. We found that our optic ataxic patient I.G. reliably \nvaried her finger-thumb grip in proportion to the object size in the perceptual task \n(Figure 2a), as has been reported before in such patients [5]. As predicted, she also \nshowed reliable grip scaling in the delayed pantomime task (Figure 2c). Thus I.G. \ncould tailor her grip to the size of the object both in an explicitly perceptual task \n(matching), and in one that relied on a visual memory (pantomimed grasping). Yet \nmuch as expected, there was only weak evidence of grip scaling in the delayed real \ngrasping task (Figure 2b). I.G.\u2019s grip aperture was variable from trial to trial, in \ncontrast with the high consistency of her perceptual estimates and pantomimed grasps.  \n \n 4\nThese data demonstrate a paradoxical improvement of grip scaling when the stimulus \nwas no longer present: the opposite of what would be expected in normal subjects [6]. \nNevertheless, there was still a mild trend for grip scaling in the delayed real grasping \ntask, a trend that had not been predicted. We therefore tested I.G. in a second session \nin which we compared delayed real grasping with standard immediate grasping.  \n \nFigure 1 \nIn this second session, I.G. performed the following tasks: (a) immediate grasping, (b) \ndelayed real grasping, and (c) delayed pantomimed grasping. The three tasks were \npresented according to an \u2018abccba\u2019 design. As predicted, we found no significant grip \nscaling during immediate grasping (Figure 3a), as in previously reported patients [4, \n5]. In delayed real grasping, however, grip scaling was now very clearly observed, \nwith I.G. opening her hand significantly less wide for the narrowest object in \ncomparison with the other three objects (Figure 3b). Finally, as predicted, clear grip \nscaling was again found in the delayed pantomime-grasping task (Figure 3c). There \nwas also a notable general reduction in I.G.\u2019s initially exaggerated grip apertures from \nthe first to the second testing blocks.  \n 5\n \nFigure 2 \nThus I.G. was unable to scale her grip size when a simple immediate grasp was \nrequired: yet having previewed the object 5 sec before being offered it to grasp, she \nnow adjusted her grip aperture quite well. Of course, in contrast to the immediate or \npantomimed tasks, for which only one source of visual information could be used, \nboth present and past visual information is potentially available in the delayed real \ngrasping task. We had initially assumed, however, that the past information would be \nentirely superseded by the new sensory information available to the visuomotor \nsystem, as was shown in a different context for proprioceptive targets [7].  \n 6\n \nFigure 3 \nBut in I.G.\u2019s case, that past information would not be redundant. Indeed her relative \nsuccess in pantomimed grasping shows that it would now provide her with better \nvisual guidance than the current information, processed within her damaged \nvisuomotor system. It is therefore possible that I.G. might have adopted a \npantomiming strategy in the delayed real grasping task, rather than relying on the \ncurrently visible object to guide her hand. Support for this superficially implausible \nidea comes from I.G.\u2019s reduced grip aperture during the second block of delayed real \ngrasping trials: previous work has shown that people open the hand less widely when \npretending to reach out and grasp than when actually doing so [6]. \n \nIn order to determine which of the two sources of visual information was used during \ndelayed real grasping, by I.G. and by healthy subjects, we created a new series of \ndelayed real grasping trials in which occasional special test trials were embedded. The \ntask was given after a series of standard delayed real grasping trials and was presented \n 7\nas yet more of the same task.  \n \nFigure 4 \nExperiment 2 \nIn this experiment only delayed real grasping was tested. However, although the usual \nfour objects were used throughout, half of the trials with the widest and narrowest \nobjects were made into test trials. On these occasions, the narrowest (2 cm) object was \ncovertly replaced during the delay interval with the widest (5 cm), or the widest \nreplaced with the narrowest (see Figure 4). In total, 48 trials were performed in a \npseudo-randomized order (12 for each object, including 6 \u2018test\u2019 trials for the widest \nand 6 for the narrowest object). Six age-matched right-handed healthy control subjects \nwere also tested using the same paradigm. \n \nFigure 5 \n 8\nWe confirmed that our controls opened their hands during the prehension movement \nentirely according to the size of the object facing them (Figure 5b). It made no \ndifference whether or not they had been shown a different block 5 sec earlier. In \nstriking contrast, I.G. opened her hand widely when the wide object had been \npreviewed, even when reaching out to grasp the narrow one (Figure 5a, right). \nEvidently I.G. used a memory-based route to by-pass her visuomotor deficit, while \nthe controls never did this. \n \nOn the test trials where the narrow object was replaced by the wide one, I.G.\u2019s \nmaximum grip did reach an appropriately wide aperture (Figure 5a, left). Presumably, \nthe initially programmed small grip aperture had to increase during the course of the \nreach in order for I.G. to eventually grasp the wide object, and this would be reflected \nin the maximum grip aperture that we measured. Of course, on the trials when she had \nto close down her grip from an expected large to an actual small object, that small \nobject was also eventually grasped correctly, but the grip would already have opened \nwidely before that correction occurred.  \n \n \nDiscussion and Conclusions \n \nPatient I.G. suffered severe bilateral damage to the homologue of the monkey\u2019s \n\u2018dorsal stream\u2019 of visual processing, causing the visuomotor difficulties typical of \noptic ataxia. The primate dorsal stream plays a specialized role in the on-line \nautomatic transformation of visual information into action coordinates [8-13], and \nindeed lesions there result in deficits closely resembling human optic ataxia [14, 15]. \n 9\nThis pattern contrasts strikingly with the effects of damage to the primate ventral \nstream, which cause profound problems in shape discrimination, but spare visually \ncontrolled reaching and grasping [16, 17]. In a similar way, the well-tested patient \nD.F., whose visual-form agnosia renders her unable to distinguish simple shapes or \ncontours, can nevertheless perform a range of actions guided by those same visual \nfeatures [18, 19]. D.F.\u2019s lesion has bilaterally disconnected her ventral stream from \nmost of its visual inputs [20].  \n \nThis double dissociation provided the rationale for the present study. The intact \nvisuomotor skills retained both by \u2018agnosic\u2019 monkeys and by the agnosic patient D.F. \nhave been attributed to a (largely) intact dorsal stream [21]. Yet Goodale and \ncolleagues [6] found that D.F. was unable to respond appropriately when asked to \nperform pantomimed grasps in response to a memorized object no longer present. \nThey proposed that healthy observers perform such delayed acts by means of a \nconscious perceptual representation of the object, rather than through direct \nvisuomotor control. This indirect route would not be available to D.F., because she \ncannot achieve the necessary perceptual representation.  \n \nThis proposal of two separate routes from vision to action [6] is attractive, but it relied \nentirely on negative evidence, in that patient D.F. performed exceptionally badly on \nthe delayed task. We therefore sought complementary positive evidence from optic \nataxia, making the prediction that patient I.G. should show improved performance in \ndelayed pantomime grasping relative to immediate grasping, a converse pattern to that \nseen in healthy subjects. We assumed that I.G. might be able to circumvent her \n 10\ndamaged visuomotor system by bringing her relatively intact perceptual system into \nplay.  \n \nWe established in Experiment 1 that I.G.\u2019s visuomotor difficulties included the \nmisgrasping of objects of different widths presented to her in peripheral vision. At the \nsame time we showed that, like previous patients [5], I.G. perceived the object widths \nquite accurately, and could signal these percepts using her finger and thumb. Most \ncrucially, we confirmed our prediction that she should show an improvement in her \ngrasping movements when performing a pantomime task: I.G. now showed good grip \nscaling. These findings thus provide the other half of a double dissociation along with \nthe data from D.F. [6]. They are clearly consistent with the idea that posterior parietal \nvisuomotor systems are part of the neural circuitry for mediating normal immediate \nobject grasping [11, 13]: but are not essential for mediating delayed responses of an \nostensibly similar kind [7, 22].  \n \nWe correctly predicted good pantomimed grasping by I.G.. However, we expected \nthat her real grasping behaviour would be equally impaired whether or not she had \nseen the object a few seconds earlier. We wrongly assumed that I.G. would try to use \nthe same visual information in both cases, namely the information present in her \nvisual field at the moment of reaching out for the object. In Experiment 2 we showed \nthat she achieved her surprisingly good delayed real grasping through a strategy quite \ndifferent from that used by normal observers. We showed this by interspersing \n\u2018invalid\u2019 probe trials within a delayed real grasping session. Healthy control subjects \ninvariably ignored the previewed information. In sharp contrast, I.G. evidently \ndepended on this previewed information, programming her grasp without regard to \n 11\nthe current visual information. Consequently when a wide object was, unbeknown to \nher, replaced by a narrow one, she opened her handgrip too widely for the object in \nfront of her.  \n \nThe present data support the idea that vision can guide action through networks other \nthan the dedicated systems of the parietal lobe. These networks have different time \nconstraints and different cognitive loadings attached to them [7, 23, 24]. Use of such \nalternative networks evidently allowed I.G.\u2019s grasping difficulties to be circumvented, \nalbeit by taking a slow and circuitous route from vision to action. \n \n \nFigure 6 \n \n 12\nMaterials and methods \n \nPatient \nI.G. had suffered a bilateral parieto-occipital infarction 17 months before the present \ntesting (see Figure 6). She initially presented with severe headache, and dysarthria and \nbilateral blindness lasting for three days. Following this, bilateral optic ataxia and \nsimultanagnosia became apparent [11, 25]. The patient had a diagnosis of ischaemic \nstroke, related to acute vasospastic angiopathy in the posterior cerebral arteries. MRI \nrevealed hyperintense signal on T2 sequences that was near-symmetrically located in \nthe posterior parietal and upper and lateral occipital cortico-subcortical regions. \nReconstruction of the lesion indicated that it involved mainly Brodmann\u2019s areas 7, 18, \n19, the intraparietal sulcus, and part of area 39. I.G. was aged 31 when we tested her, \nby which time her simultanagnosia had subsided, at least for presentations of two to \nthree objects [11].  \n \nApparatus  \nAs in several previous studies [6, 19], we used rectangular blocks varying in width, \nbut of constant surface area. Four different blocks were used, with the dimensions: 5 \ncm x 5 cm, 4 cm x 6.25 cm, 3 cm x 8.3 cm, and 2 cm x 12.5 cm. They were made of \ndark grey plastic with a thickness of 1 cm, and were presented on a table against a \nwhite background. Due to the fact that I.G.\u2019s optic ataxia chiefly affects non-foveal \nvision, we presented the objects eccentrically, using a central red fixation spot. The \nleft edge of each object was positioned 6 cm (approximately 5\u00b0) to the right of this \nspot. Fixation was checked continually by an experimenter facing the patient.  \n \n 13\nGrip aperture was measured by means of a magnetic movement recording system \n(Minibird, Ascension Technology Ltd), with markers attached to the tips of the \nforefinger and thumb. This allowed us to record finger-thumb separation, in 3D space, \nthroughout all of the reaching and grasping movements, or for 1 sec in the case of \nI.G.\u2019s size judgements in the perceptual matching task. The dependent variable of \ninterest was the maximum grip aperture attained during reaching (MGA), or the mean \nfinger-thumb aperture in the case of perceptual matching. These measures are linearly \nrelated to object size in healthy subjects in all of the tasks. In grasping tasks, MGA \nprovides a direct index of the use of visual information in advance of contact with the \nobject [26].  \n \n \n 14\nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors are grateful to I.G. for her good-humoured cooperation in this research, \nand to the Wellcome Trust (grant no. 052443), Leverhulme Trust (grant no. \nF00128C), and INSERM PROGRES (grant no. 4P012E) for financial support. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15\nReferences \n \n1.

In delayed real grasping, the subject then had \nto reach out and grasp the object. In pantomimed grasping, however, the subject had \nto pretend to reach out and grasp the object after this delay, as it had been covertly \nremoved during the delay period.  \n \nFigure 2 \nExperiment 1: I.G.\u2019s maximum grip aperture (MGA) during a perceptual matching \ntask and two delayed prehension tasks. Within each block of trials, each object was \npresented four times in a pseudo-randomized order (no object was presented twice in \nsuccession).  \nLinear regression analysis showed that I.G. scaled her grip size in relation to object \nwidth at high levels of significance in both (a) the matching task [r2 = 0.80; F(1,14) = \n56.08] and (c) the delayed pantomime task [r2 = 0.66; F(1,14) = 26.75, p < 0.001]. \nThere was much less indication of grip scaling in the delayed real grasping task (b), \nthough it did just reach significance [r2 = 0.26; F(1,14)=4.97, p<0.05]. Grip size \nvaried from trial to trial considerably more during delayed real grasping (average SD \nper object width = 13.65) than during pantomimed grasping (average SD =6.48) or \nperceptual matching (average SD = 4.38). \n \n 19\nFigure 3 \nExperiment 1: I.G.\u2019s maximum grip aperture during three different prehension tasks.  \n(a) In the immediate grasping task, the subject simply had to reach out to pick up the \ntarget object, front to back using forefinger and thumb, as soon as it became visible. \nLinear regression showed no significant relation between object width and MGA \nduring this task [r2 = 0.08; F(1, 30) = 2.53]. (b) During delayed real grasping, \nhowever, clearly significant grip scaling was observed [r2 = 0.43, F(1,30) = 22.91, \np<0.001]. (c) As expected, highly significant grip scaling was also found in the \ndelayed pantomime grasping task [r2 = 0.40, F(1,30) = 19.83, p<0.001]. In all three \ntasks, MGA was significantly smaller during the second block of trials [immediate \ngrasping: F(1,24) =46.37, p<0.001; delayed real grasping: F(1,24) = 20.82, p<0.001; \ndelayed pantomimed grasping F(1,24) =11.74, p< 0.005].  \n \nFigure 4 \nSchematic depiction of Experiment 2.  \nIn a quarter of all trials, the widest object (50 mm) was covertly replaced by the \nnarrowest (20 mm), or vice-versa, during the delay period (bottom). In another quarter \nof the trials the narrowest and widest objects remained unchanged (top). In the \nremaining half of the trials, objects of intermediate widths were used (30 and 40 mm, \nnot depicted here), and remained unchanged throughout each trial. \n \n 20\nFigure 5  \nExperiment 2: Maximum grip aperture a function of final object size for patient I.G. \nand one representative control subject.  \nThe MGA data were analysed for each subject individually using ANOVAs with \ninitial and final object size as independent variables. For all of the subjects there was a \nsignificant main effect of final object size (p<0.005), but none of initial object size. \nHowever, there was a significant interaction between initial and final object size for \npatient I.G. only [F(1, 19) = 7.01, p<0.02]. Inspection of the data reveals that when \nthe initial object was 5 cm wide and covertly replaced by the 2 cm wide object, I.G. \nprogrammed her grip size on the basis of the initial large object width. All of the six \ncontrol subjects always used the final object size for programming their MGA, \nirrespective of whether it had changed during the trial. \n \nFigure 6 \nA coronal section through I.G.\u2019s brain, visualized with structural MRI.  \nExtensive damage is present bilaterally in the posterior parietal lobes. \n \n"}
