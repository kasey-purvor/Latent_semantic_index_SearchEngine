Large geomagnetic storms are associated with electron population changes in the 1 \nouter radiation belt and the slot region, often leading to significant increases in the relativistic 2 \nelectron population. The increased population decays in part through the loss, i.e., precipitation 3 \nfrom the bounce loss cone, of highly energized electrons into the middle and upper atmosphere 4 \n(30-90 km). However, direct satellite observations of energetic electrons in the bounce loss 5 \ncone are very rare due to its small angular width. In this study we have analyzed ground-based 6 \nsubionospheric radio wave observations of electrons from the bounce loss cone at L=3.2 during 7 \nand after a geomagnetic disturbance which occurred in September 2005. Relativistic electron 8 \nprecipitation into the atmosphere leads to large changes in observed subionospheric amplitudes. 9 \nSatellite-observed energy spectra from the CRRES and DEMETER spacecraft were used as an 10 \ninput to an ionospheric chemistry and subionospheric propagation model, describing the 11 \nionospheric ionization modifications caused by precipitating electrons. We find that the peak 12 \nprecipitated fluxes of >150 keV electrons into the atmosphere were 3500\u00b1300 el. cm-2s-1 at 13 \nmidday and 185\u00b115 el. cm-2s-1 at midnight.  14 \n For six days following the storm onset the midday precipitated fluxes are approximately 20 15 \ntimes larger than observed at midnight, consistent with observed day\/night patterns of 16 \nplasmaspheric hiss intensities. The variation in DEMETER observed wave power at L=3.2 in 17 \nthe plasmaspheric hiss frequency band shows similar time variation to that seen in the 18 \nprecipitating particles. Consequently, plasmaspheric hiss with frequencies below ~500 Hz 19 \nappears to be the principal loss mechanism for energetic electrons in the inner zone of the outer 20 \nradiation belts during the non-storm time periods of this study, although off-equatorial chorus 21 \nwaves could contribute when the plasmapause is L<3.0. 22 \n1.  Introduction  23 \n3 \n The behavior of high energy electrons trapped in the Earth's Van Allen radiation belts has 1 \nbeen extensively studied, through both experimental and theoretical techniques. During quiet 2 \ntimes, energetic radiation belt electrons are distributed into two belts divided by the \"electron 3 \nslot\" at L~2.5. In the more than four decades since the discovery of the belts [Van Allen, 1997], 4 \nit has proved difficult to confirm the principal source and loss mechanisms that control 5 \nradiation belt particles [Walt, 1996]. It has been recognized for some time that the loss of 6 \nradiation belt electrons in the inner magnetosphere is probably dominated by both pitch angle 7 \nscattering in wave-particle interactions with whistler mode waves and Coulomb scattering. 8 \nCollisions with neutral atmospheric constituents are the dominant loss process for energetic 9 \nelectrons (>100 keV) only in the inner-most parts of the radiation belts (L<1.3) [Walt, 1996], as 10 \ndemonstrated by the comparison of calculated decay rates with the observed loss of electrons 11 \ninjected by the 1962 Starfish nuclear weapon test (Figure 7.3 of Walt [1994]). For higher L-12 \nshells, radiation belt particle lifetimes are many orders of magnitude shorter than those 13 \npredicted from atmospheric collisions, such that other loss processes are clearly dominant. 14 \nAbove L~1.5 Coulomb collision-driven losses are generally less important than those driven by 15 \nwhistler mode waves, including plasmaspheric hiss, lightning-generated whistlers, and 16 \nmanmade transmissions [Abel and Thorne, 1998]. The electron slot is believed to result from 17 \nenhanced electron loss rates occurring in this region. Much attention has been given to the role 18 \nof plasmaspheric hiss in maintaining the electron slot [Lyons and Williams, 1984], although it 19 \nhas been suggested that lightning generated whistlers may also be significant in this region 20 \n[e.g., Lauben et al., 2001]. Other calculations suggest that all 3 types of whistler mode waves 21 \nmay play important roles in the loss of energetic electrons in the inner magnetosphere [Abel 22 \nand Thorne, 1998]. 23 \n Relatively small changes in the outflow of particles from the Sun can trigger geomagnetic 24 \nstorms [Sharma et al., 2004], which produce large changes in radiation belt populations. 25 \n4 \nTypically, the relativistic electron population drops out during the main phase of a storm, 1 \nrecovering on a time scale of ~1 day to a level that may or may not be greater than the pre-2 \nstorm level (but can be several orders of magnitude larger). Essentially all geomagnetic storms 3 \nsubstantially alter the electron radiation belt populations [Reeves et al., 2003], in which 4 \nprecipitation losses play a major role [Green et al., 2004]. A significant fraction of the particles 5 \nare lost into the atmosphere [Horne, 2002; Friedel et al., 2002; Clilverd et al., 2006a], although 6 \nstorm-time non-adiabatic magnetic field changes also led to losses through magnetopause 7 \nshadowing [e.g. Ukhorskiy et al., 2006].  8 \n Large geomagnetic storms are associated with radiation belt electron population changes in 9 \nthe outer radiation belt, the electron slot region, and in rare cases the inner radiation belt (L<2) 10 \n[Baker et al., 2004], where lifetimes are extremely large and hence the increases are long-lived. 11 \nAn example of this was provided by SAMPEX satellite observations of relativistic electrons 12 \nduring a series of large storms that took place in October-November 2003 which show that the 13 \nnormal peak of electron fluxes around L\u22484.0 was displaced far inward to L<2.5 for a period of 14 \nat least two weeks. The period between 29 October and 4 November 2003, widely known as the 15 \nHalloween storms, lead to a 104 increase in relativistic electron population in the slot region 16 \n[Baker et al., 2004]. This period was also associated with a number of \"anomalies\" in 17 \nspacecraft in Earth orbit and beyond, and in some cases, failures [Webb and Allen, 2004]. It has 18 \nbeen suggested that the very large and rapid increases in trapped electron populations provide 19 \nstrong evidence for acceleration processes driven by very low frequency (VLF) whistler mode 20 \nchorus [Horne et al., 2005].  21 \n The new population of 2-6 MeV electrons observed during two injections into the slot region 22 \nat L\u22482.5 decayed in an exponential manner, with e-folding lifetimes of 4.6 and 2.9 days. 23 \nHowever, due to the very large increases in the 2-6 MeV electron fluxes at L\u22482.5 and the two 24 \ninjections which occurred in this period, the fluxes in the slot did not return to normal until 3-4 25 \n5 \nweeks after the second injection [Baker et al., 2004]. It is generally understood that the 1 \nexponential loss was due to cyclotron resonant interactions with VLF waves near the equatorial 2 \nzone [Tsurutani and Lakhina, 1997]. Pitch angle scattering of energetic radiation belt electrons 3 \n[Kennel and Petschek, 1966] by whistler mode waves drives some resonant electrons into the 4 \nbounce loss cone, resulting in their precipitation into the atmosphere. Direct satellite 5 \nobservations of energetic electrons in the bounce loss cone are very rare. For most of the outer 6 \nradiation belts, the loss cone is too narrow to be clearly resolved by existing satellite-borne 7 \nparticle detectors.  8 \n The effect of \"pumping up\" the radiation belts is eventually translated to the Earth by the 9 \nloss, i.e., precipitation, of highly energized electrons into the middle and upper atmosphere (30-10 \n90 km). The precipitation of energetic electrons changes the atmospheric radiation balance 11 \nthrough the production of ozone destroying species which, in turn, modify climate forcing 12 \n[Haigh et al., 2005]. Energetic electron precipitation results in enhancement of odd nitrogen 13 \n(NOx) and odd hydrogen (HOx), which play a key role in the ozone balance of the middle 14 \natmosphere because they destroy odd oxygen through catalytic reactions [Brasseur and 15 \nSolomon, 1986]. When this precipitation occurs during the winter darkness, the long-lived NOx 16 \nproduced is confined by the polar vortex, and within it descends downward to stratospheric 17 \naltitudes throughout the winter [Callis et al., 1996, Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 2007]; according to recent 18 \nmodel results the following ozone reductions in the stratosphere lead to changes in temperature 19 \nand could possibly effect atmospheric circulation as well as the variation in the zonal winds 20 \n(QBO, Quasi Biennal Oscillation) [Elias and de Artigas, 2003; Rozanov et al., 2005; 21 \nLangematz et al., 2005]. 22 \n For electrons >100 keV, the bulk of the precipitated energy is deposited into the middle and 23 \nupper atmospheric levels (~30-90 km), and hence causes the lower ionospheric boundary (the 24 \nD-region), to shift downwards. One of the few experimental techniques which can probe these 25 \n6 \naltitudes uses VLF electromagnetic radiation, trapped between the lower ionosphere and the 1 \nEarth [Barr et al., 2000]. The nature of the received radio waves is largely determined by 2 \npropagation between these boundaries [e.g., Cummer at al., 2000]. Significant variations in the 3 \nreceived amplitude and\/or phase of fixed frequency VLF transmissions arise from changes in 4 \nthe lower ionosphere, for example, the additional ionization produced by energetic particle 5 \nprecipitation. VLF radio wave propagation has been shown to be sensitive to relativistic 6 \nelectron precipitation events during geomagnetic disturbances [Thorne and Larsen, 1976; 7 \nClilverd et al., 2006a]. The effect on the signals can be either an increase or decrease in signal 8 \namplitude, depending on the modal mixture of each signal observed. Further discussion on the 9 \nuse of subionospheric VLF propagation as a remote sensing probe can be found in recent 10 \nreview articles [e.g., Barr et al., 2000; Rodger, 2003]. Observations of subionospheric VLF 11 \ntransmissions permit observers to study energetic particle precipitation from locations remote 12 \nfrom the actual precipitation region. 13 \n In this study we analyze ground-based measurements of ionospheric ionization changes 14 \nobserved during and after a geomagnetic disturbance which occurred in September 2005. This 15 \ngeomagnetic disturbance led to increases in the electron fluxes in the slot and inner edge of the 16 \nouter radiation belt. Our subionospheric radio wave observations show that while energetic 17 \nprotons from a solar proton event strike the high-latitude polar atmosphere, there is also 18 \nrelativistic electron precipitation occurring at L\u22483. This highly energetic electron precipitation 19 \nleads to large changes in subionospheric amplitudes, for both day- and night-time conditions. 20 \nMeasurements of electron fluxes are provided by instruments onboard the Combined Release 21 \nand Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) and DEMETER satellites, describing the changes in 22 \nflux and energy spectrum. The observed energy spectra are used as an input to an ionospheric 23 \nchemistry and subionospheric propagation model, to describe the nature of the ionosphere 24 \nmodified by precipitating electrons from the radiation belts. The combination of satellite and 25 \n7 \nsubionospheric measurements allows us to determine the time-varying electron precipitation 1 \nfluxes into the atmosphere following a storm time injection into the inner edge of the outer 2 \nradiation belt.  3 \n2.  Geophysical Conditions 4 \n2.1 Summary of activity 5 \n In August-September 2005 there were a series of 3 major geomagnetic disturbances as 6 \nrecorded by the Dst index, each one of which was associated with a >10 times increase in the 7 \nsolar wind density and coronal mass ejections from the Sun. We focus on the last of the 3 8 \ndisturbances due to subionospheric data we have available, as outlined in the section below. On 9 \n7 September 2005 the GOES spacecraft recorded an X17 solar flare which produced a solar 10 \nproton event at the Earth shortly afterwards. Proton fluxes at GOES orbits were increased for 11 \nabout a week. The X17 flare was followed over the next week by a series of flares, some of 12 \nwhich were also greater than X1. During this time a GOES-detected X6.2 flare was associated 13 \nwith a SOHO reported \"Halo\" Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) on 9 September 2005, with 14 \nsubsequent \"Halo\" CMEs on the 10th and 11th of September. This disturbed time period 15 \ntriggered a geomagnetic storm on 11 September 2005, with Dst reaching -120 nT and Kp 16 \nreaching 8. A summary of the geophysical conditions from 1 September 2005 is shown in 17 \nFigure 1. The top panel shows the GOES-measured proton fluxes, the middle panel the Dst 18 \nindex, and the lower panel the Kp index. This plot shows the time delay between the solar 19 \nproton event seen in the upper panel, associated with a Halo CME launched from the Sun and a 20 \nsolar flare, and the geomagnetic storm seen in the lower two panels triggered by the arrival of 21 \nthe CME at the Earth.  22 \n2.2 Satellite observations of the radiation belts 23 \n8 \n The geomagnetic storm of 11 September 2005 led to an increase in the energetic electron 1 \npopulation in the inner edge of the outer radiation belt. Figure 2 shows the evolution with time 2 \nin satellite measured >150 keV integral electron flux at L=3.2 in the drift loss cone, observed 3 \nby the IDP instrument onboard the DEMETER satellite. We do not include flux measurements 4 \nmade inside the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly. DEMETER is the first of the Myriade 5 \nseries of microsatellites developed by the Centre National d\u2019Etudes Spatiales for low-cost 6 \nscience missions, and was placed in a circular Sun-synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 7 \n710 km at the end of June 2004. The IDP spectrometer [Sauvaud et al., 2006] is unusual in that 8 \nit has very high energy resolution; in normal \"survey\" mode the instrument measures electron 9 \nfluxes in the drift loss cone with energies from 70 keV to 2.34 MeV using 128 energy channels. 10 \nDEMETER observations at L=3.2 indicate that the typical >150 keV integral electron flux in 11 \nthe drift loss cone is ~2\u00d7102 el. cm-2s-1sr-1 which occurs outside the time range shown in this 12 \nfigure. Geomagnetic storms in late August 2005 boost the >150 keV fluxes to ~2\u00d7105 el. cm-2s-13 \n1sr-1, after which it decays as seen in Figure 2 in early September. After the 11 September 2005 14 \ngeomagnetic storm DEMETER shows that the electron fluxes in the drift loss cone increases by 15 \na factor of ~1000 above ambient conditions, and a factor of 100 above the pre-storm flux 16 \nlevels. The fluxes decay to within a factor of 5 of the ambient levels\/noise floor over 14 days, 17 \nafter which there is a large data-gap in the DEMETER data (several weeks). 18 \n The DEMETER observations are consistent with the typical behavior of energetic electron 19 \nincreases at L=3.05 reported by CRRES. There were 5 events during the CRRES mission that 20 \nresulted in perpendicular fluxes of 1.09 MeV electrons greater than 1000 cm-2s-1sr-1keV-1 at 21 \nL=3.05. After each event the fluxes decayed gradually on a timescale of ~5.5 days either to 22 \nquiet time levels or until another flux increase, all increases being caused by enhanced 23 \nmagnetic activity [Meredith et al., 2006a]. Unlike DEMETER, which measures electrons in the 24 \ndrift loss cone and is in low Earth orbit, CRRES was placed on a highly elliptical 25 \n9 \ngeosynchronous transfer orbit with a perigee of 305 km and an apogee of 35,768 km, sweeping 1 \nthrough the heart of the radiation belts approximately 5 times per day on average, and thus 2 \nmeasuring trapped fluxes near the geomagnetic equator. For this reason we cannot make a \"like 3 \nwith like\" comparison between the measurements of the two spacecraft. The relatively long 4 \nlifetime of CRRES, providing multiple energy-channel observations of energetic radiation belt 5 \nelectrons, allows an indication of \"typical\" storm-time increases and their subsequent decay to 6 \nnormal levels. However, CRRES was launched on 25 July 1990 and operated for 15 months 7 \nand thus cannot provide direct observations for the disturbance in mid-September 2005.  8 \n Figure 3 shows an example of the typical perpendicular electron flux spectra reported by the 9 \nMedium Electrons A (MEA) experiment onboard CRRES following enhanced magnetic 10 \nactivity. The MEA instrument, which used momentum analysis in a solenoidal field, had 17 11 \nenergy channels ranging from 153 keV to 1.582 MeV [Vampola et al., 1992]. This particular 12 \nexample is from 20 June 1991, following a geomagnetic storm which occurred on 17 June. The 13 \nfigure shows the trapped electron flux spectra for the 17 MEA energy channels. Also shown is 14 \na power-law fit to this flux spectrum (gray line), used to extend the energy range when 15 \nconsidering the atmospheric precipitation as outlined below. The power law fit is in the form of 16 \n10-\u03b3E where \u03b3=1.2\u00d710-3 keV-1. The thin line in Figure 3 shows the comparison with the 17 \nDEMETER-observed spectrum for electrons in the drift-loss cone at L=3.2 on 12 September 18 \n2005, where the flux values have been shifted upwards by a factor of 60 to overlay with the 19 \nCRRES fluxes. The crosses indicate the energy channels, and emphasize the difference 20 \nbetween the two instrument's energy resolution. There is a very good agreement between the 21 \ntypical CRRES post-storm trapped flux spectrum and the energy spectrum reported by 22 \nDEMETER in the drift-loss cone across all energies. CRRES measured trapped fluxes about 23 \nthe geomagnetic equator, while DEMETER fluxes describe the drift-loss cone. While neither 24 \ninstrument provides direct measurements of the particles precipitating in a specific part of the 25 \n10 \nworld, the agreement between the two provides strong evidence that this spectrum will provide 1 \na reasonable description of that in the bounce loss cone precipitating into the atmosphere and 2 \nmeasured by our ground-based instruments. Based on Figure 3 we therefore make use of the 3 \nfitted energy spectrum and the associated trapped CRRES magnitudes to determine the 4 \nmagnitude of the energetic precipitation into the atmosphere during the mid-September 2005 5 \nperiod.  6 \n3.  Subionospheric Experimental Observations 7 \n3.1 Experimental setup 8 \n Here we use narrow band subionospheric VLF data from a 24.0 kHz transmitter (call sign 9 \nNAA, 44.6\u00baN, 67.3\u00baW, L=3) located in Cutler, Maine and received at three European sites. 10 \nWhile NAA is often taken to radiate 1 MW, in mid-late 2005 the transmitter was radiating 11 \nabout 600 kW. The receivers are located at: Cambridge, England (52.3\u00baN, 0\u00baE, L=2.3), Ny 12 \n\u00c5lesund, Svalbard (79\u00baN, 11\u00baE, L=18.3), and Sodankyl\u00e4, Finland (67\u00baN, 23\u00baE, L=5.1). These 13 \nsites are part of the Antarctic-Arctic Radiation-belt Dynamic Deposition VLF Atmospheric 14 \nResearch Konsortia (AARDDVARK). More information on AARDDVARK can be found at 15 \nthe Konsortia website: http:\/\/www.physics.otago.ac.nz\/space\/AARDDVARK_homepage.htm. 16 \nFigure 4 shows the location of the transmitter site (circle), the receiver sites (diamonds), and 17 \nthe modeling location (54\u00b0N, 35\u00b0W, asterisk), and also indicates the great circle propagation 18 \npaths between the transmitter and receivers. The receivers at these locations were AbsPAL 19 \n(Cambridge) [Thomson et al., 2005], and OmniPAL (Ny \u00c5lesund, Sodankyl\u00e4) [Dowden et al., 20 \n1998] instruments, both of which log the amplitude and phase of the MSK modulated 21 \ntransmissions from NAA. The midpoints of the transmitter-receiver great circle paths are at 22 \nL\u22483.2 for NAA-Cambridge, L\u224812 for NAA- Ny \u00c5lesund, and L\u22487.5 for NAA- Sodankyl\u00e4. 23 \n3.2 Modeling subionospheric propagation 24 \n11 \n Mesospheric ionization effects on VLF\/LF wave propagation can be modeled using the Long 1 \nWave Propagation Code [LWPC, Ferguson and Snyder, 1990]. LWPC models VLF signal 2 \npropagation from any point on Earth to any other point. Given electron density profile 3 \nparameters for the upper boundary conditions, LWPC calculates the expected amplitude and 4 \nphase of the VLF signal at the reception point. For undisturbed time periods, the D-region 5 \nelectron density altitude-profile is often expressed through a Wait ionosphere, defined in terms 6 \nof a sharpness parameter \u03b2 and a reference height h' [Wait and Spies, 1964], and the electron 7 \nnumber density (i.e., electrons per m-3), Ne, increases exponentially with altitude z,  8 \n  Ne(z) = 1.43 \u00d7 1013 exp(-0.15 h') \u00d7 exp((\u03b2-0.15)(z- h')).   (1) 9 \nFor example, the amplitude of NAA at Cambridge at midday for undisturbed ionospheric 10 \nconditions has been experimentally measured at 60-61 dB above 1 \u03bcVm-1. Using the daytime 11 \nionospheric model of McRae and Thomson [2000], where \u03b2=0.37 km-1 and h'=72.5 km, LWPC 12 \nmodels the received amplitude of NAA at Cambridge as 60.7 dB above 1 \u03bcVm-1, showing the 13 \npower of the model. The LWPC model can be used to investigate changes in the lower 14 \nionosphere as long as the induced changes to the electron density altitude-profiles are known. 15 \nOne approach is to provide this using the Sodankyl\u00e4 Ion Chemistry model [SIC, version 6.8, 16 \nVerronen et al., 2005] to determine the effects of the additional ionization caused by particle 17 \nprecipitation. The combination of LWPC and the SIC model to understand VLF observations 18 \nhas been reported in previous studies [e.g., Clilverd et al., 2005; 2006b]. The modeling of 19 \nelectron density changes produced by particle precipitation is described in Section 4.0, which 20 \nalso includes a full description of SIC.  21 \n3.3 Subionospheric observations 22 \n Figure 5 shows the NAA received amplitude (diamonds) at Ny \u00c5lesund (NYA; top panels), 23 \nSodankyl\u00e4 (SGO; middle panels), and Cambridge (CAM; lower panels) for midday (right 24 \npanels) and midnight (left panels) conditions. Note that the experimental data is in dB relative 25 \n12 \nto an arbitrary reference level. In all 6 panels, the dash-dot lines show the expected amplitudes 1 \nfor undisturbed conditions. The heavy black horizontal line indicates the main period where 2 \nKp>6 (10-13 September). The onset of the solar proton event shown in Figure 1 is indicated by 3 \nthe vertical dashed line. The solid line in the top two sets of panels is the predicted NAA 4 \namplitude modeling using a combination of LWPC and the SIC model to simulate the effect of 5 \nthe solar protons following the approach outlined in Clilverd et al. [2006b]. As expected the 6 \nproton simulations show that the two top (high L-shell) receivers are strongly influenced by 7 \nprecipitation of protons during the solar proton event. The modeling indicates that we would 8 \nnot expect the proton effects to last beyond the 15th September during the night, and the 20th 9 \nSeptember during the day, which is in very good agreement with the observations at Ny 10 \n\u00c5lesund (NYA). However, the observed amplitude changes at Sodankyl\u00e4 (SGO) are larger and 11 \nlonger lived than predicted from the proton forcing modeling. In addition, there are substantial 12 \nchanges in the observed NAA amplitude at Cambridge, which will only be marginally impacted 13 \nby protons due to rigidity cutoffs [St\u00f6rmer, 1930], even taking into account the levels of 14 \ngeomagnetic activity [Rodger et al., 2006]. This provides strong evidence for the precipitation 15 \nof energetic electrons from the radiation belts occurring at lower L-shells, with the path from 16 \nNAA to CAM dominated by the electron precipitation. 17 \n We therefore concentrate on the NAA observations from Cambridge, for which the great 18 \ncircle path largely passes along the L=3.2 contour, and so is only likely to be affected by the 19 \nCRRES and DEMETER reported radiation belt flux enhancements described above. Additional 20 \nevidence for this comes from the NAA to CAM observed amplitudes in early September, which 21 \nindicate precipitation from the late August\/early September geomagnetic storms. This is in 22 \ncontrast with NAA to NYA, the received amplitudes of which agree well with the expected 23 \nundisturbed conditions. As shown in the lower panels of Figure 5, the ionospheric forcing from 24 \nthe energetic electron precipitation leads to a 2.4\u00b10.3 dB increase in the amplitude of NAA 25 \n13 \nobserved at Cambridge at midday, but a 14\u00b11 dB decrease in the same quantity observed at 1 \nmidnight. By modeling the time-varying amplitude changes of NAA observed at Cambridge we 2 \ncan determine the precipitation rate of electrons from the radiation belts along this great circle 3 \npath.  4 \n4.  Ionospheric effects of precipitation  5 \n The ionization rate due to precipitating energetic electrons is calculated by an application of 6 \nthe expressions in Rees [1989], expanded to higher energies based on Goldberg and Jackman 7 \n[1984]. The background neutral atmosphere is calculated using the NRLMSISE-00 neutral 8 \natmospheric model [Picone et al., 2002]. The energy spectrum is taken from the fit to the 9 \nCRRES observations shown in Figure 3, extrapolated over the energy range 150-3000 keV. As 10 \nthe precipitating flux magnitude is unknown, and the topic of our study, we consider what 11 \nelectron precipitation flux best reproduces our subionospheric radio wave data using the fitted 12 \nenergy spectrum. 13 \n4.1 Sodankyl\u00e4 Ion Chemistry model 14 \n In order to determine the impact of the energetic precipitation on the lower ionosphere, the 15 \nionization rate must be combined with a chemistry model to determine the change in electron 16 \nnumber density. Figure 6 shows the impact of the CRRES-described precipitating electrons on 17 \nthe lower ionosphere at midday (upper panel) and midnight (lower panel), calculated by the 18 \nSodankyl\u00e4 Ion Chemistry model (solid lines). The Sodankyl\u00e4 Ion Chemistry (SIC, version 6.8) 19 \nmodel is a 1-D ion and neutral chemistry model designed for ionospheric D-region studies, 20 \nsolving the concentrations of 63 ions, including 27 negative ions, and 13 neutral species at 21 \naltitudes across 20\u2013150 km. The model has recently been discussed by Verronen et al. [2005], 22 \nbuilding on original work by Turunen et al. [1996] and Verronen et al. [2002]. A detailed 23 \n14 \noverview of the model was given in Verronen et al. [2005], but we summarize in a similar way 1 \nhere to provide background for this study. 2 \n In the SIC model several hundred reactions are implemented, plus additional external forcing 3 \ndue to solar radiation (1\u2013422.5 nm), electron and proton precipitation, and galactic cosmic 4 \nradiation. Initial descriptions of the model are provided by Turunen et al. [1996], with neutral 5 \nspecies modifications described by Verronen et al. [2002]. Solar flux is calculated with the 6 \nSOLAR2000 model (version 2.21) [Tobiska et al., 2000]. The scattered component of solar 7 \nLyman-\u03b1 flux is included using the empirical approximation given by Thomas and Bowman 8 \n[1986]. The SIC model includes vertical transport [Chabrillat et al., 2002] which takes into 9 \naccount molecular diffusion coefficients [Banks and Kockarts, 1973]. The background neutral 10 \natmosphere is calculated using the MSISE-90 model [Hedin, 1991] and tables given by 11 \nShimazaki [1984].  12 \n Figure 6 shows the \"ambient\" electron number density profiles for midday and midnight 13 \n(lines with crosses), calculated by the SIC model with no particle precipitation on 13 14 \nSeptember 2005 at the location (54\u00b0N, 35\u00b0W) marked on Figure 4, i.e., the half-way point on 15 \nthe NAA-CAM path. The SIC-calculated precipitation-modified electron number density 16 \nprofiles presented in this figure (solid line) represent the stable equilibrium state for the 17 \nelectron number density including the effect of a constant CRRES-described electron 18 \nprecipitation source, with a stable state reached in <10 minutes after the precipitation starts. 19 \nThe upper panel shows the resulting enhanced electron densities at midday created by energetic 20 \nprecipitation with a >150 keV integral flux magnitude (measured in el. cm-2s-1) that is 4\u00d710-5 of 21 \nthe trapped flux reported by CRRES (Figure 4), while the lower panel shows this for midnight 22 \nand a flux magnitude that is 2\u00d710-6 of the trapped flux reported by CRRES. The choice of the 23 \ndaytime and nighttime precipitation flux magnitudes will become apparent in Section 5.  24 \n15 \n The energetic electron precipitation significantly alters the electron number density in Figure 1 \n6 over the altitude range of ~55-90 km, by 1.5-2 orders of magnitude at ~70 km. Note that this 2 \nreflects the significance of the precipitation, and not the limits of the 150-3000 keV energy 3 \nrange. Precipitating 3 MeV electrons produce ionization rates which are largest at ~47 km 4 \naltitude, which due to the spectral roll-off in population have a minor effect as seen in Figure 6. 5 \nIn contrast, 150 keV electrons affect altitudes above about ~80 km. Taking the lower limit of 6 \n150 keV does not significantly alter the electron profiles; for example, taking the lower limit as 7 \n10 keV would lead to no change in Figure 6 for daytime conditions, and a very slight increase 8 \nin electron density for nighttime altitudes above 85 km (not shown), too small to make a 9 \nsignificant change in the VLF propagation conditions relative to the much more significant 10 \nelectron density increases at lower altitudes.  11 \n4.2 \"Simple\" ionospheric electron model 12 \n The full SIC model is somewhat too complex for exploring the most-likely precipitation flux 13 \nmagnitudes with LWPC, as the computation time is relatively high. For this reason, we made use 14 \nof a considerably simpler model to describe the balance of electron number density in the lower 15 \nionosphere, based on that given by Rodger et al. [1998]. In this model the evolution of the 16 \nelectron density in time is governed by the equation 17 \n     \n2 \nee\ne NNq\nt\nN\n\u03b1\u03b2\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212\u2212=      (2)  18 \nwhere q is the ionization rate, \u03b1 is the recombination coefficient (m3s-1), and \u03b2 is the attachment 19 \nrate (s-1). Rodger et al. [1998] provides expressions for the altitude variation of \u03b1 and \u03b2, 20 \nappropriate for nighttime conditions. A comparison of the SIC calculations with the electron 21 \nnumber densities calculated using the Rodger expressions, for the same ionization rates, 22 \nshowed that the Rodger expressions provided acceptable agreement with the SIC nighttime 23 \ncalculations, but that the Rodger approach gave very different answers when compared with the 24 \n16 \nSIC daytime calculations. However, through trial and error modified recombination and 1 \nattachment coefficients have been determined which do an excellent job at reproducing both 2 \nthe daytime and nighttime SIC electron number densities, but with much lower computational 3 \nloads. Note that these expressions can only provide information on electron number densities, 4 \nunlike SIC which solves the ion and neutral concentrations. A comparison between SIC and the 5 \nsimple model is shown in Figure 6, where the simple model is shown as a dotted line with 6 \ncircles.  7 \nNighttime: Small changes are made in the Rodger et al. [1998] expressions to provide the best 8 \nquality agreement with SIC nighttime calculations. For altitudes above 80 km,  9 \n     \u03b1eff = 2.5 \u00d7 10-11 eT\n300  m3s-1    (3)  10 \nwhere Te is the electron temperature, while for altitudes of 80 km and below,  11 \n     \u03b1eff = 2.0 \u00d7 10-12 \n550\n300\n.\neT\n\u2212\n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b  m3s-1    (4)  12 \n The attachment rate in Rodger et al. [1998] is described through \u03b2 = \u03b21 + \u03b22, where \u03b21 is 13 \ndefined in Table 1 of that paper, and \u03b22 in equation (22). In the modified expressions,  14 \n     \u03b2 = (\u03b21 + \u03b22)\/1.4      (5)  15 \nDaytime: The original Rodger expressions are insufficient to describe the daytime electron 16 \ndensity levels, particularly attachment-reactions which occur much more slowly due to solar 17 \ninput. For altitudes above 84 km,  18 \n     \u03b1eff = 3 \u00d7 10-12 eT\n300  m3s-1     (6)  19 \nwhile for altitudes of 84 km and below,  20 \n     \u03b1eff = 5.0 \u00d7 10-13 \n550\n300\n.\neT\n\u2212\n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b  m3s-1    (7)  21 \n The attachment rate for daytime is best modeled by  22 \n17 \n     \u03b2 = (\u03b21 + \u03b22)\/75      (8)  1 \n5.  Modeling the precipitation effect on subionospheric propagation 2 \n The electron number density profiles determined using the simple ionospheric electron model 3 \nfor varying precipitation flux magnitudes are used as input to the LWPC subionospheric 4 \npropagation model, thus modeling the effect of precipitation on the NAA received amplitudes 5 \nat Cambridge. An undisturbed electron density profile is used which reproduces the received 6 \nNAA amplitudes at Cambridge, specified by the Wait ionosphere \u03b2=0.37 km-1 and h'=72.5 km 7 \nfor midday and \u03b2=0.5 km-1 and h'=85 km for midnight. The difference in the LWPC-modeled 8 \nreceived amplitude changes for varying precipitation magnitudes is shown in Figure 7, for 9 \nmidday (top panel) and midnight (bottom panel) ionospheric conditions. The horizontal dotted 10 \nlines indicate the peak experimentally observed amplitude differences, +2.4\u00b10.3 dB at midday 11 \non 13 September 2005 and -14\u00b11 dB at midnight on 12 September 2005. The peak 12 \nexperimental amplitude difference at midday is best modeled by a flux magnitude that is 13 \n~4.5\u00d710-5 of the typical post-storm trapped flux reported by CRRES, while for midnight the 14 \nexperimental data is best modeled by a flux magnitude ratio of ~2.4\u00d710-6. This equates to peak 15 \nprecipitated fluxes of >150 keV electrons of 3500\u00b1300 el. cm-2s-1 at midday and 185\u00b115 el. cm-16 \n2s-1 at midnight. For both midday and midnight conditions, multiple precipitation flux levels 17 \ncan lead to the same amplitude difference, particularly for the midnight case, where there is a 18 \nvery strong modal discontinuity for flux ratios of about 4\u00d710-6. In general it should be possible 19 \nto discriminate between the possible fluxes by assuming near-continuity in the day-to-day 20 \nprecipitation levels, although this should be confirmed by follow-on studies.  21 \n6.  Observed precipitation from subionospheric propagation measurements 22 \n18 \n Figure 8 shows the time variation of the >150 keV electron flux precipitated into the 1 \natmosphere, determined from the time-varying amplitude differences of NAA received at 2 \nCambridge (L=3.2) shown in Figure 5 combined with the modeled response shown in Figure 7. 3 \nBoth daytime (diamonds) and nighttime (asterisks) precipitating fluxes are seen to increase 4 \naround the start of the large geomagnetic storm on 11\/12 September 2005, followed by a 5 \nrecovery towards undisturbed conditions over the following 10-15 days. During the six days 6 \nfollowing the storm onset the midday precipitated fluxes are approximately 20 times larger than 7 \nobserved at midnight. This day-night precipitation flux difference is consistent with the 8 \nstatistical pattern of plasmaspheric hiss intensities reported around the geomagnetic equator 9 \nusing CRRES observations. During geomagnetically disturbed conditions (AE*>150 nT) the 10 \naverage plasmaspheric hiss intensity in the 0.2-0.5 kHz band was reported to be ~10 times 11 \nstronger on the dayside than the nightside, while at higher frequencies (4-5 kHz) the waves are 12 \norders of magnitudes weaker and stronger on the nightside rather than dayside [Meredith et al., 13 \nFigure 7, 2006b]. At L=3.2, 0.5 kHz waves will undergo cyclotron resonance [Chang and Inan, 14 \n1983] with 160 keV electrons, altering the pitch angles of the electrons and potentially driving 15 \nthem into the bounce loss cone such that they can precipitate into the atmosphere. Lower 16 \nfrequencies resonate with higher energy electrons, representative of the >150 keV precipitating 17 \nfluxes considered in our study, with 1 MeV electrons resonating with waves of ~40 Hz. Thus 18 \nthe observed variation in the low-frequency band plasmaspheric hiss could drive the 19 \nprecipitation of energetic electrons, leading to the order of magnitude day-night difference in 20 \nprecipitation fluxes seen in Figure 8.  21 \n The ICE instrument on the DEMETER spacecraft provides continuous measurements of the 22 \npower spectrum of one electric field component in the VLF band (Berthelier et al., 2006). 23 \nFigure 9 shows the daily variation in the mean power spectrum over the frequency band 40-24 \n500 Hz for the geographic longitude range 300-360\u00baE and L=3.2, i.e., corresponding to the 25 \n19 \ngreat circle path between NAA and Cambridge. Again, the daytime observations are 1 \nrepresented by diamonds while those at night are shown by asterisks. Comparing Figure 8 and 2 \nFigure 9 shows quite close agreement between the behavior of the 40-500 Hz waves in the 3 \nplasmaspheric hiss band and the observed precipitating electrons. Note that both the wave 4 \npower and precipitating particle fluxes vary by a factor of ~200 between the period 9-11 5 \nSeptember 2005, with the daytime wave powers roughly ten times larger than at nighttime, and 6 \nwith a similar ratio between day and night seen in the precipitating fluxes. In the periods where 7 \nthe wave power is larger by night than by day, for example 5-9 September, there is evidence for 8 \nsimilar behavior in the precipitating particles. The primary difference between the two plots 9 \noccurs before 5 September 2005 and after 20 September 2005. For the situation before 5 10 \nSeptember 2005 large plasmaspheric hiss wave power is present, but strong increases in 11 \nprecipitating particle fluxes were not seen, despite the availability of particles in the radiation 12 \nbelts (Figure 2). In the later case the large plasmaspheric hiss wave power present in the 13 \ndaytime was not associated with a subionospherically-measured increase in precipitation 14 \nfluxes, perhaps because of a lack of particle availability. Nonetheless, this comparison provides 15 \nstrong evidence that plasmaspheric hiss with frequencies below ~500 Hz is the primary driver 16 \nfor the loss of energetic electrons in the inner zone of the outer radiation belts during the non-17 \nstorm time periods of this study period. However we acknowledge that the driver that leads to 18 \nthe differing precipitation fluxes we observe on the dayside and nightside is not wholly 19 \nresolved, and the examination of additional similar events will be necessary to confirm the 20 \ncurrent study. 21 \n7.  Discussion 22 \n Meredith et al. [2003b] have shown that the intensities of lower-band VLF chorus, which has 23 \nfrequencies from a tenth to a half of the electron gyrofrequency, are also enhanced during 24 \n20 \ngeomagnetic disturbances. However, dawnside equatorial chorus does not reproduce the day-1 \nnight differences seen in our precipitation fluxes, as it has peak intensities on the morning and 2 \nevening side. In addition at L=3.2 the electron gyrofrequency is 26.6 kHz such that the lower-3 \nband chorus resonant energies span ~1-25 keV, much smaller than required to explain our 4 \nobserved precipitation range. In contrast, off-equatorial lower-band chorus is ~100 times 5 \nstronger on the dayside than the nightside, considerably larger than the factor of 10 difference 6 \nseen in our precipitation measurements. However, for off equatorial chorus  (observed between 7 \n15 and 30 degrees off the magnetic equator and which is enhanced on the dayside) the resonant 8 \nenergies are much higher  ~250 keV to ~1 MeV. This suggests that off equatorial chorus could 9 \ncontribute to the loss of energetic electrons as has been previously suggested by various authors 10 \n[e.g. Horne and Thorne, 2003]. 11 \n The position of the plasmapause plays an important role in determining what processes may 12 \nbe operating in a particular region at a given time. During strong magnetic activity 13 \nplasmaspheric hiss is enhanced inside the plasmasphere, principally on the dayside [Meredith et 14 \nal., 2004]. In contrast, enhanced whistler mode chorus waves tend to be observed outside of the 15 \nplasmapause, with the equatorial and mid-latitude waves being observed principally on the 16 \ndawn-side and day-side respectively [Meredith et al., 2003a]. During strong magnetic activity 17 \n(Kp* > 6-) the plasmapause can move inside of L = 3.0 [Carpenter and Anderson, 1992], where 18 \nKp* is the maximum value of the Kp index in the previous 24 hours. Thus there are some storm-19 \ntime intervals, notably ~11-14 and 15-16 September 2005, when our transmitter-receiver great 20 \ncircle path at L \u2248 3.0 is likely to be outside of the plasmapause, at least at certain local times. 21 \nDuring these intervals there could be a contribution from the off-equatorial (dayside) chorus 22 \n[e.g. Horne and Thorne, 2003]. Using IMAGE EUV measurements taken at 23:38 UT 12 23 \nSeptember 2005 available from euv.lpl.arizona.edu\/, we have confirmed that the nighttime 24 \nplasmapause was at about L=3.5, following the approach outlined in Goldstein et al. [2003]. 25 \n21 \nThus our transmitter-receiver GCP was inside the plasmapause during the storm time of mid-11 1 \nto mid-13 September when Kp\u22486. At the non-storm times our transmitter-receiver GCP at L \u2248 2 \n3.0 will be inside the plasmasphere, and as such chorus will not play a role during these times. 3 \nThe period of gradual decay occurring after 17 September 2005 seen in Figure 2 is thus most 4 \nlikely due to plasmaspheric hiss, whereas the period of decay between 11 and 17 September 5 \ncould be due to a combination of both hiss and chorus. 6 \n The time-varying observations of electron losses from the inner zone of the outer radiation 7 \nbelts shown in Figure 8 will provide an important constraint to radiation belt electron 8 \nacceleration and loss models currently under development [e.g., Horne et al., 2005]. In 9 \naddition, the fluxes reported in this study can be used to drive atmospheric chemistry models 10 \n[e.g., Verronen et al., 2005] and test the relative significance of this precipitation to neutral 11 \natmospheric chemistry.  12 \n8. Summary 13 \n The effect of \"pumping up\" the radiation belts during geomagnetic storms is translated to the 14 \nEarth by the loss, i.e., precipitation, of highly energized electrons into the middle and upper 15 \natmosphere (30-90 km). However, direct satellite observations of energetic electrons in the 16 \nbounce loss cone are very rare due to the small size of the loss cone. In this study we have 17 \nanalyzed ground-based subionospheric radio wave observations of the bounce loss cone during 18 \nand after a geomagnetic disturbance which occurred in September 2005. After the 11 19 \nSeptember 2005 geomagnetic storm the particle instrument onboard the DEMETER spacecraft 20 \nshows that the >150 keV electron fluxes in the drift loss cone at L=3.2 increased by a factor of 21 \n~1000 above ambient conditions. The fluxes decayed to within a factor of 5 of the ambient 22 \nlevels over the following 14 days. The DEMETER-measured electron energy spectrum for the 23 \npost-storm increase has a gradient consistent with the typical spectra observed by the CRRES 24 \n22 \nspacecraft for injections into the inner zone of the outer radiation belts, despite DEMETER 1 \nmeasuring drift loss cone fluxes and CRRES measuring fluxes trapped near the geomagnetic 2 \nequator.  3 \n Our subionospheric radio wave observations of the NAA transmitter received at Cambridge 4 \nduring this period show that there is relativistic electron precipitation into the atmosphere 5 \noccurring at L\u22483. This highly energetic electron precipitation leads to large changes in 6 \nsubionospheric amplitudes, with peak experimentally observed amplitude differences of 7 \n+2.4\u00b10.3 dB at midday on 13 September 2005 and -14\u00b11 dB at midnight on 12 September 8 \n2005. The observed energy spectra were used as an input to an ionospheric chemistry and 9 \nsubionospheric propagation model, to describe the nature of the ionospheric ionization 10 \nmodifications caused by the precipitating electrons. The peak precipitated fluxes of >150 keV 11 \nelectrons into the atmosphere were 3500\u00b1300 el. cm-2s-1 at midday and 185\u00b115 el. cm-2s-1 at 12 \nmidnight.  13 \n The combination of satellite and subionospheric measurements allowed us to determine the 14 \ntime-varying electron precipitation fluxes following a storm time injection into the inner edge 15 \nof the outer radiation belt, providing a direct measurement of the losses from the radiation belts 16 \ninto the atmosphere. During the six days following the storm onset the midday precipitated 17 \nfluxes are approximately 20 times larger than observed at midnight, consistent with observed 18 \nday\/night patterns of plasmaspheric hiss intensities. The variation in DEMETER observed 19 \nwave power at L=3.2 in the plasmaspheric hiss band shows similar time variation to that seen in 20 \nthe precipitating particles. Plasmaspheric hiss with frequencies below ~500 Hz appears to be 21 \nthe primary driver for the loss of energetic electrons in the inner zone of the outer radiation 22 \nbelts during the non-storm time periods of this study, although off-equatorial chorus waves 23 \ncould contribute when the plasmapause is L<3.0. 24 \n 25 \n23 \nAcknowledgments.  The peak amplitude changes observed at Cambridge correspond to the 1 \nbirthday of our co-author, Annika Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4. May her birthdays always bring us such luck!
