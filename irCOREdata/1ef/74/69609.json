This unprecedented \nadoption of a \u201eday-date\u201f release schedule by the film\u201fs British distributor is a sign \nthat, as a consequence of shifts in film-viewing practices, the cinema screen is no \nlonger the first choice of platform for audiences. Releasing a film in several media \nformats simultaneously cuts the distribution costs (reducing the number of prints that \nneed to be struck, and reducing the advertising costs, since the film only needs to be \nmarketed once), and makes the distribution of such low-budget films as this \u00a31.45m \nproduction viable. \nImportantly, however, simultaneous distribution allows a film like The Road \nto Guant\u00e1namo to reach a much wider audience on its immediate release than it might \notherwise address if it were released only into cinemas in the first instance before \nbeing released over several months on satellite or cable, on DVD and video, and then, \nfinally, on free-to-air broadcast TV. It can circulate in the public sphere in a \nsignificant and very particular way. On the one hand this \u201erepresents the emergence of \n                                                 \n1\n Although Mat Whitecross, who has been employed by Michael Winterbottom\u201fs production company, \nRevolution Films, in a range of roles from runner to editor, is credited as co-director of The Road to \nGuant\u00e1namo, this article discusses the film primarily in relation to other films directed by \nWinterbottom. This is not to imply that Whitecross made no significant creative or authorial \ncontribution to the film. Rather, analysing this film in relation to Winterbottom\u201fs other work makes \nvisible the way The Road to Guant\u00e1namo develops and explores the political and activist potential of \npopular cinema. \n \n \n \nnew business models in film that seek to capitalize on the economics of consumer \ndemand to access content when, and where, they want it\u201f while also pre-empting \n\u201epiracy\u201f (Davies and Withers, 2006: 61). On the other, it exploits the technical \ndevelopments that facilitate this commercial shift in order to reach large international \naudiences quickly.\n2 \nThere is, arguably, a relationship between the mode of production \nand distribution and the film\u201fs capacity to intervene in the transnational circulation of \nmediated representations of the \u201ewar on terror\u201f. The simultaneous dissemination of the \nfilm in different formats allows the film to contribute to debates about terror and \ndemocracy and the legitimacy of the Guant\u00e1namo prison in a particularly direct and \nrapid way by addressing and generating multiple, overlapping publics through these \ndifferent media. In recounting or making public the experiences of three British men \nimprisoned at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, and perhaps provoking, or intervening in, broader \ndebates about Britain\u201fs alliance with the US and the \u201ecoalition of the willing\u201f, the \ninvasion of Iraq, and \u201eextraordinary rendition\u201f, the film is also engaged with making \npublics, with the project of generating an active\/activist audience. \n \n\u2018Double perspective\u2019 \n \nThe Road to Guant\u00e1namo is a film about the \u201ewar on terror\u201f on which the US and its \nallies embarked in response to the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington DC \nin September 2001. Rather than attempting to offer a comprehensive overview of this \nhistorical passage, however, the film explores these events synecdochically through a \nnarrowly focused account of the terrifying and absurd experiences of a handful of \n                                                 \n2\n While the film remains available for streaming or downloading from the Channel 4 website at a fee, a \ncomplete low-resolution copy of the film can also be freely obtained from the file-sharing site, Google \nVideo, where it can be viewed online or downloaded for viewing on a portable media player, greatly \nextending the transnational mobility of the film. \nindividuals who are inadvertently swept up in the chaotic opening stages of the war. \nTelling the story of three British-Asian tourists who were arrested in Afghanistan and \nlater removed to Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison where they were interrogated and tortured \nfor months, the film offers a coolly detailed and unsensational account of the \nexperiences of these men as they are transported across national borders and into the \ninterstitial, heterotopic spaces of prisons and internment camps. \nThus The Road to Guant\u00e1namo provides a counterpoint to the accounts of \nreporters and camera crews \u201eembedded\u201f with US and UK troops that have dominated \ncoverage of the conflict in Afghanistan and the subsequent invasion of Iraq. \nInterviewed during the production of the film, co-director Michael Winterbottom \nsuggested that the film adopts a \u201edouble perspective\u201f from the point of view of \nwestern spectators (Anon 2006b: 11). That is to say, we are shown events from a \ndifferent angle of vision, that of marginal or excluded figures, revealing aspects of the \nscene that would otherwise have remained hidden from sight. In a sense, then, the film \nconstitutes a \u201ereverse shot\u201f, returning the mediated gaze of the western spectator. \nThe film seems to have been conceived as an intervention in the transnational \nmedia spectacle of the \u201ewar on terror\u201f in a very precise and partial way, as a \ncompeting or contestatory narrative. Winterbottom\u201fs comment acknowledges the \nlimited possibilities open to (art-house) film-makers or commentators in challenging \nor responding critically to the homogeneous and ubiquitous representations of the war \nwithin carefully managed Western news media. At the same time, he recognizes the \ndistance between the activist function of the film and that of news reportage which, as \nfilm theorist Bill Nichols observes, \u201eurges us to look but not care, see but not act, \nknow but not change. The news exists less to orient us toward action than to \nperpetuate itself as commodity, something to be fetishized and consumed\u201f (Nichols \n1991: 194). Winterbottom\u201fs comment also acknowledges the limitations of any \nindividual account of the war, accepting that a single film can only ever offer a \nprovisional, questionable narrative, rather than a true and definitive account of any set \nof events. Winterbottom, therefore, invites us to regard The Road to Guant\u00e1namo not \nas a singular historical document, but rather as a complicating account that qualifies \nor puts into play other accounts of the war and that, in turn, will be read in relation to \nthem. \nThe term, \u201edouble perspective\u201f, is thus an accurate description of the film\u201fs \nstatus as it circulates around the screens of Western Europe and the US and in \ndiscourses about the \u201ewar on terror\u201f. It is also an accurate and suggestive description \nof the political\/textual strategies employed by the film. The film is structured around a \ndouble perspective in its visible blending of documentary actuality with dramatized \nre-enactment and one of the consequences of the film\u201fs assemblage from this \n\u201ematerial\u201f is that its hybrid composition and unstable textual status remains subtly \nvisible. The double perspective is incorporated into the film, to produce multiple \nperspectives. Rather than a clear view of events, then, the film induces a double vision \nof the various activities grouped and legitimated under the name of \u201ewarfare\u201f.  \nA similar strategy of internal doubling (and a consciousness of context) may \nbe found elsewhere in Winterbottom\u201fs work. In an essay on recent transnational films \nconcerned with immigration, Yosefa Loshitsky has argued that Winterbottom\u201fs earlier \nfilm, In This World, employs a similar structural device of double perspectives. The \nfilm recounts the wretched journey of two young refugees from the Shamshattoo \nrefugee camp on the Pakistan\/Afghanistan border to Britain in search of a liveable \nlife, and Loshitsky suggests that it refuses to resolve the image by privileging one \nperspective over the other. Instead, the film maintains a tension between the \nspectator\u201fs touristic gaze, and that of the refugees, Jamal and Enayat, producing a \ncomplex \u201edialectics of gazes\u201f:  \n             \n The spectator\u201fs gaze (mimicking the tourist\u201fs gaze) is negated by the  \nrefugee\u201fs gaze. One contradicts the other. While one gaze is in search of \npleasure (even an involuntary one), the other seeks survival [\u2026] The \nspectator\u201fs gaze [\u2026] oscillates between the two gazes, the pleasure-seeking \ngaze of the tourist and the refuge-seeking refugee\u201fs gaze. This oscillation \nbetween tourism and \u201epoorism\u201f is used in In This World has a distanciation \neffect, resulting in a Brechtian drama of alienation (Loshitsky 2006: 753) \n \nHowever, the distanciation effect of The Road to Guant\u00e1namo is quite different since \nthe central figures are British and also, crucially, adults.\n3\n The result is in some \nrespects a subtler play of perspectives. On the one hand, the pleasure-seeking touristic \ngaze of the spectator is frustrated since the film eschews the rich use of colour and \nstriking images of landscape that characterize In This World in favour of a muted \ncolour scheme (punctuated by the bright orange of the jumpsuits worn by the inmates \nat Guant\u00e1namo) and a claustrophobic emphasis on the interiors of vehicles, rooms, \ninternment camps and prison cells. On the other hand, the film collapses an opposition \nbetween the gaze of the spectator and that of the main characters since they quite \nliterally embody the touristic gaze. However, this alignment of gazes has the potential \nto produce a different sort of discomfort since, while Asif Iqbal, Ruhel Ahmed and \nShafiq Rasul set out from Britain as tourists at the beginning of the film, as British-\nAsians their non-white bodies don\u201ft correspond to the image of a Western traveller \n                                                 \n3\n See Bennett and Tyler 2007 for a discussion of the problematic figure of the child refugee in \nWinterbottom\u201fs work. \nand this, we can infer, is the main reason for the subsequent repeated misrecognition \nof them as Islamist fighters or terrorists. This incompatibility may well also be the \nsource of an uncomfortable identificatory relationship for white viewers, interfering \nwith a conventional tendency to identify with a (white) narrative protagonist since, \nalthough they are not \u201eother\u201f in the same sense as the refugees in In This World, their \nhyphenated ethnic identities and bodies mark them as visibly different. \nThe Road to Guant\u00e1namo tells the true story of four British-Asian men from \nTipton in the Midlands, Iqbal, Ahmed, Rasul and Monir Ali. The film opens with the \nfour friends flying to Pakistan in September 2001 to attend Iqbal\u201fs wedding. Once \nthere they take the opportunity to travel around Pakistan as sight-seers and then decide \nto cross the border to Afghanistan after hearing an Imam in a mosque call for \nvolunteers to go to offer help to its impoverished population. Persuaded that the \ncountry isn\u201ft about to be attacked, with time on their hands and eager for both \u201ethe \nexperience\u201f and the \u201ebig naans\u201f you can find there, they cross the border. \nThe U.S. bombing of Afghanistan begins shortly after they arrive in Kandahar \nin the south and they subsequently find themselves stranded in the capital, Kabul, \nunable to arrange passage back to Pakistan. In error, they take a minibus north to \nKunduz province, which is on the frontline between Taliban forces and the anti-\nTaliban Northern Alliance. One of the four friends, Monir Ali, is separated (and is \npresumed to have been killed) during the evacuation of Kunduz and the remaining \nthree are captured by the Northern Alliance along with foreign fighters after the truck \nconvoy they are in is bombed by US aircraft. Narrowly avoiding execution at the \nhands of the Northern Alliance soldiers, they are imprisoned in Sheberghan before \nbeing handed over to US marines who detain them at Kandahar air-base. There they \nare interrogated and beaten both by the SAS and US soldiers.  \n In early 2002 they are flown from Kandahar to the makeshift detention centre, Camp \nX-Ray (and later moved to the purpose-built prison, Camp Delta) at the Guant\u00e1namo \nBay naval base in Cuba where they are imprisoned and interrogated by inquisitors \nfrom MI5 and the US. They are abused, beaten, tortured and held in isolation cells for \nmonths before finally being returned to the UK in March 2004 over two years later \nand released without charges.  \n          The film finishes, in a gesture towards conventional narrative resolution, with \nthe three friends themselves, rather than the actors, returning to Pakistan for Asif\u201fs \nwedding. \nMichael Winterbottom describes The Road to Guant\u00e1namo as \u201epart-road \nmovie, part-war film, part-prison movie\u201f and while this is a broadly accurate outline \nof the sequence in which events take place within the film, it is also somewhat \ndisingenuous since Winterbottom\u201fs film has little in common with the melodrama and \neroticized fascination with masculinity and homosociality that is often intrinsic to \nthese genres (Anon. 2006b: 11). The Road to Guant\u00e1namo is not a film about heroic \nresistance and endurance, and unlike many examples of the genres Winterbottom \ncites, with its flat, matter-of-fact style, the film does not invite us to read it as allegory \nor myth. However, what Winterbottom\u201fs description of the film as an unlikely \nassemblage of disparate generic elements does suggest effectively is the somewhat \ninconsistent structure of this hybrid film that splices together interviews with the three \nmen, dramatized reconstructions of their experiences, documentary material and \narchive news footage. Thus, the film has a heterogeneous form, combining and \njuxtaposing different orders of representational material without privileging one over \nanother. This formal disunity or incoherence is a consistent feature of Winterbottom\u201fs \nwork. The prolific director has produced films in a wide range of genres such as \u201epost-\nheritage\u201f costume dramas (Jude (1996), The Claim (2000)) and romantic comedies \n(Go Now (1995), With or Without You (1999)), a sexually explicit art-house film (9 \nSongs (2004)), a road movie (Butterfly Kiss (1995)), a war film (Welcome to Sarajevo \n(1997)) and a science fiction film (Code 46 (2003)). Like The Road to Guant\u00e1namo, \nall of these films sit uneasily in any particular generic category. They are often \nformally complex and playful texts that foreground the signs of the film\u201fs \nconstruction or employ metanarrative devices such as characters that comment upon \nthe film they are part of, or the placing of real historical individuals alongside the \nactors who play them in the film.  \nThe imbrication of documentary and drama is nevertheless a particularly \nsignificant and appropriate device for the exploration of some of the questions raised \nby The Road to Guant\u00e1namo with regard to visibility, representation and mediation, \nnot least because of the ethically\/ontologically\/generically problematic status of the \ndramatized documentary. Winterbottom has stated (echoing ethnographic film-maker \nJean Rouch)\n4\n that, \u201eI don\u201ft think there\u201fs a border between fiction and reality\u201f.5 While \nthe delineation of this boundary in cinema may be unclear or mobile, nevertheless it is \ncertainly the case that a number of his films are preoccupied with this border, crossing \nand re-crossing it repeatedly to varying effects.  \nFilm theorist Bill Nichols suggests that films that mix documentary footage \nwith filmed reconstructions in the interests of spectatorial engagement, or in order to \ncompensate for the absence of useable or extant material, inevitably \u201etrade \n                                                 \n4\n As Rouch writes, again aligning cinema with doubled perspectives: \u2018As a filmmaker and ethnographer, \nI see virtually no boundary between documentary film and fiction film. As the art of the double, cinema \nis inherently a transition from the world of the real to the world of the imagination, and ethnography, as \nthe science of other peoples\u201f thought systems, is a permanent crossing over from one conceptual \nuniverse to another, a form of acrobatic gymnastics where losing one\u201fs footing is the least of the risks \none runs\u201f (Rouch, 1981). \n5\n Michael Winterbottom: Profile of a Film-Maker (Charles 2002) \ndocumentary authenticity for fictional identification\u201f (Nichols 1991: 250). This \npractice involves film-makers in ethical and political compromises, he argues, and \nalso risks undermining the \u201ecredibility\u201f of a film since the result of such a collocation \nof actuality and staged sequences is that: \n \nthe special indexical bond between image and historical referent is ruptured. In \na re-enactment, the bond is still between the image and something that \noccurred in front of the camera but what occurred occurred for the camera \n(Nichols 1991: 21). \n \nNichols recognizes that \u201ehistorical indexicality\u201f can never be guaranteed since \u201eone \nperson\u201fs historical evidence is another person\u201fs fiction\u201f; nevertheless, he insists that \ndocumentary and fiction are distinguished fundamentally by their referential function \n(161). As he explains, \u201eDocumentary shares the properties of a text with other fictions \n[\u2026] but it addresses the world in which we live rather than worlds in which we may \nimagine living\u201f (112). Responding to Nichols\u201fs argument, Neil Paget argues that this \napparently clear distinction is untenable in relation to the dramatized documentary, a \nform that provocatively posits an equivalence between documentary and fiction, and \nthat remains directed towards lived reality:  \n \nFrom its \u201emoment of presentation\u201f in fictional, dramatic form \ndramadoc\/docudrama points beyond the realm of fiction to a realm of non-\nfiction that is always already lived. In one sense, all drama aspires to this \ncondition, but this kind of drama, by pointing at an explicit rather than implicit \nreality, \u201eindexes\u201f that explicit reality in ways that are difficult to ignore even if \nwe deny them (Paget 1998: 136). \n \nIn this respect, for Paget, an insistence upon the irreducible distinction between drama \nand documentary is unhelpful in its disregard for the historical realities which \ndramatized documentaries both represent and trouble. While stating that \u201esome form \nof truth is the always receding goal of documentary film\u201f, Linda Williams contends \nthat the political value of such films lies not in a demystificatory capacity to lay bare \nto us the truth of contemporary\/historical reality, but in their capacity to intervene in \nthe mediated public sphere (Williams 1998: 393). Williams acknowledges that the \nspecific cultural context in which films are viewed will necessarily frame their \nmeaning and so the truths represented or embodied by a particularly film are \ninevitably relative and partial, though not necessarily insignificant or ineffective. \nHowever, in the strategic deployment of staged scenes and reconstructions, \ndocumentary films can articulate \u201econtingent\u201f truths that function to counter \ndangerous or destructive fictions.  Thus for Williams: \n \nThe choice is not between two entirely separate regimes of truth and fiction. \nThe choice, rather, is in strategies of fiction for the approach to relative truths. \nDocumentary is not fiction and should not be conflated with it. But \ndocumentary can and should use all the strategies of fictional construction to \nget at truths. (393-4) \n \nIn other words, the truth-value of documentaries is that they can work to challenge, \ncontradict, qualify or affirm univocal truth claims already in circulation; they are texts \nthat can interfere with the contexts through which they move, generating alternative or \nmultiple perspectives. In bringing together different orders of material, The Road to \nGuant\u00e1namo constitutes a troubling intervention amid the proliferation of \njustificatory, belligerent or putatively \u201eeven-handed\u201f, liberal representations of the \nGuant\u00e1namo Bay prison and the wider conduct of the \u201ewar on terror\u201f. \nIn this film, the authenticity of those shots and scenes that appear to be \nunstaged gives a greater impact to those moments that are apparently dramatized, a \nquality that Vivian Sobchack describes as the \u201echarge of the real\u201f (Sobchack 2004). \nWriting on the interplay between represented reality and irreality in fiction films that \nincorporate documentary elements - such as real historical figures or star couples who \nplay fictional couples - Sobchack has argued that the distinction between these \nsupposedly different elements of a film turns as much on the extra-textual knowledge \nand expectations with which films are viewed, as it does on any indexical properties \nor textual qualities of the film image. In a sense then, the distinction between \ndocumentary and fiction film is more a distinction between different modes of \nspectatorship or consciousness, than a distinction between irreducibly different \nsequences of film. Moreover, Sobchack observes that our mode of spectatorial \nengagement is mobile or distracted, so that we typically move between these different \nmodes of consciousness in the course of viewing a film.  When, for example, we \nwatch a scene with an actor playing a fictional character on a crowded city street we \nmay find our attention wanders to fall on the people in the surrounding crowd as we \nreflect on whether they know they are in a film: \n             \nAs we scrutinize their faces for signs of possible awareness of the camera \nfilming them or of what suddenly becomes not the character but the actress \nacting in their midst, they no longer are generalized in status, no longer merely \nquasi characters necessary to the verisimilitude of the realist mise-en-sc\u00e8ne. \nRather, they become for us real people, ambiguous existential ciphers \n(Sobchack 2004: 275). \n \nMany of the early scenes of The Road to Guant\u00e1namo seem to have been shot \nguerrilla-style with the actors apparently improvising as they travel around Pakistan \nand Afghanistan on foot and in various forms of transport, and the scenario Sobchack \ndescribes characterizes well the experience of watching many scenes in this film.\n6\n \nThey pose the question not so much whether or not this is documentary \u2013 a question \nthat is attendant on viewing any film or TV documentary and that is, in any case, \nunanswerable \u2013 but to what degree a particular scene may be considered to be \ndocumentary. As Sobchack suggests, this question may just as easily be posed by a \nfiction film since a shift of perspective, in which we recognize that what we are \nwatching is a filmed record of a staged event, is a common experience of film-\nviewing. Indeed, we could ask whether this layered mode of spectatorship, a double \nperspective of a different order, always characterizes film-viewing. For example, the \nsuccess of a star performance is dependent upon our recognition that it is, precisely, a \nperformance, no matter how unmediated, before a camera: \n             \nFor a moment, then, in the midst of a fiction, we find ourselves in a \ndocumentary. This quite common experience demonstrates that although  \ndocumentary and fictional consciousness are incommensurable, they are  \ncompossible in any given film. Furthermore, it demonstrates that documentary  \n                                                 \n6\n The film was shot in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, and Britain. \nand verisimilar fictional space are constituted from the same worldly \u201cstuff\u201d \u2013  \nthe former giving existential ballast to the \u201erealism\u201f of the latter even as its  \nspecificity is usually bracketed and put out of play and on the sidelines of our  \nconsciousness (Sobchack 2004: 275). \n \nThe Road to Guant\u00e1namo, more clearly, perhaps, than any of Winterbottom\u201fs other \nfilms, is structured from this heterogeneous \u201eworldly \u201cstuff\u201d\u201f, in an aggregate of \nfiction and documentary. Rather than carefully bracketing the documentary material \nand pushing it safely to the margins, on the contrary Winterbottom\u201fs films put it into \nplay with the fictional components, and so watching The Road to Guant\u00e1namo it is \nfrequently unclear whether we are watching actuality or drama. The effect of this \ncomplex \u201edouble perspective\u201f is that the dramatic reconstructions and conjectured \nsequences are given a \u201echarge of reality\u201f from the documentary material (rather than \nbeing \u201eexposed\u201f by this juxtaposition as fictional), while the distance between the \ndocumentary and reconstruction is largely maintained and made visible. At the same \ntime, however, since the dramatized elements of the films are at times \nindistinguishable from documentary due to the use of improvisation, hand-held \ncameras, non-actors, and guerrilla-style shooting on location with hidden \nmicrophones, the reliability of the documentary sequences is, in turn, put into \nquestion. \n  \nFor instance, the scene in which the four friends are shown travelling across the \nborder into Afghanistan opens with a caption, \u201ePAKISTAN-AFGHANISTAN \nBORDER 13 OCTOBER 2001\u201f superimposed on what appears to be an excerpt from \na contemporaneous British TV news report or documentary as it is accompanied by \nthis fragmentary voice-over: \u201eBorder trade continues unimpeded. Among those \ncrossing are brave Afghan aid workers. The people rely on them for food and \nhealthcare and to explain their needs to the outside world\u201f. A montage of shots of \nshifting crowds of people, soldiers, motorbikes and trucks, is intercut with shots of the \nactors making their way across the border on foot or riding pillion on motorcycles. \nShots of Asif Iqbal and Ruhel Ahmed recalling their experience of crossing into \nAfghanistan are also inserted into this sequence and they are also heard speaking in \nvoice-over during the montage. The rhythmic, non-diegetic music that plays quietly \nthroughout this sequence helps to \u201esmooth over\u201f the multiple cuts, making it \nextremely difficult to identify the points of transition between the different elements. \nThis uncertainty \u2013 what Sobchack terms an \u201eunsettling epistemological \nambiguity\u201f and one newspaper review of the film describes as \u201ea kind of vertigo in the \nviewer, an almost philosophical confusion about the literalness of the filmed image\u201f - \nis put to varying uses in Winterbottom\u201fs films and sometimes has a comic effect as in \nA Cock and Bull Story (2005), but it is not experienced as radically disruptive or \nunsettling by the spectator (Scott, 2006). One of the main reasons for this is that this \nmontage of different orders of material is a very familiar formal device from \ntelevision. A huge number of TV programmes, from historical documentaries, through \ndocudramas and reality TV programmes to news broadcasts, combine dramatic \nreconstructions with other types of material in a casual and sometimes indifferent \nway. Raymond Williams\u201f characterization of broadcast TV output as non-linear, \ndiscontinuous, heterogeneous \u201eflow\u201f identifies a similar organizing principle \nunderlying the medium at a general level (Williams 1975: 86). \nThe Road to Guant\u00e1namo draws on the expectations and cognitive aptitudes of \nthe television viewer who is adept at making sense of and reading across different \ntypes of material and so, for example, there is no expository voice-over commentary \n(except where the film incorporates excerpts from news programmes) and no captions \nto indicate when we are watching a reconstruction with actors or even that the film \ntells a \u201etrue story\u201f. The film\u201fs deployment of a formal model derived from television \ncan be explained in part by the film\u201fs financing by a TV company (a feature of much \nrecent film production in Britain), as well as by Winterbottom\u201fs background in \ndirecting TV drama and well as feature films. It could also be understood as an \neffect\/acknowledgement of the increasing convergence of film and television \u2013 a \nmovement that is suggested by the decision to adopt the new business model of \nreleasing a film in several media formats simultaneously.\n7\n  \nHowever, most importantly with regard to its form and the film\u201fs strategic \ndouble perspective, the juxtaposition of documentary footage and dramatized material \nis a means by which the Tipton Three (as they were named by the British press) can \ntell their story publicly. The film allows them to speak for themselves (insofar as they \nare permitted to do so by the directors\/editors) and so the film\u201fs hybrid form is \ndetermined, to some extent, by the ethical and political imperative to foreground these \nmen. Thus the film is interspersed with shots of Iqbal, Ahmed and Rasul discussing \ntheir experiences. They address the camera directly (with any prompts or questions \nfrom an interviewer having been edited out) and are all shot in the same visually \nneutral way as if to suggest minimal mediation; they are framed in static medium \nclose-up shots with high-key lighting against a mottled grey and beige background. \nWhat is striking about their accounts is the deadpan neutrality. They are not \n                                                 \n7\n It is also common for European \u201earthouse\u201f directors to move between media for a range of reasons, \nboth practical and political. Alongside Winterbottom we might cite such border-crossers as Ken Loach, \nJean-Luc Godard, Werner Herzog, Krzysztof Kieslowski, Lars von Trier, Ingmar Bergman and Rainer \nFassbinder. \nimpassioned, defensive, distressed or self-justificatory as they speak, but, rather, they \nremain composed and seem to be variously reflective, cynical, amused and optimistic.  \n \nIndeed, although they have been through fairly similar experiences they reach quite \ndifferent conclusions about them towards the end of the film. Iqbal explains that \u201eIt \nchanged my life. My life\u201fs completely different. The way I look at things, the way I \nlook at the world. The world\u201fs not a nice place.\u201f Rasul, on the other hand, reflects, \n\u201eLooking back on it now, yeah, it was an experience, and it has changed my life for \nthe better \u2013 for me \u2013 so I don\u201ft really regret it.\u201f Ahmed then explains that, \u201eI haven\u201ft \nchanged a great deal, just that I practise my religion more. I mean, I didn\u201ft even \npractise at all before.\u201f  \nAnd so, the film refrains from offering us a clear resolution, a closing down of \nthe debates with which the film is intended to intervene, or a reassuring sense that \ntheir brutal treatment had had a positive or \u201eredemptive\u201f transformative effect on their \nlives. The film also refrains from offering the shot that would guarantee its \nauthenticity and incisiveness \u2013 the interviewee breaking down in tears or incoherent \nrage in the process of recounting and reliving his traumatic experiences. In other \nwords, what the film foregoes is political affect, in its concern, perhaps, with political \neffects. The Road to Guant\u00e1namo does not move us through empathy and \nidentification, inviting us to share the experiences of these three men as they are \nincarcerated and relentlessly questioned, taunted and screamed at, held in isolation, \nbeaten, shackled to the floor. Instead, the subtle effect of the film\u201fs neutral register is \na growing sense of the distance between US president George Bush\u201fs comment at the \nfilm\u201fs opening during a press conference with UK prime minister Tony Blair \u2013 in \nwhich he is presumably referring to Al Qaeda or the Taliban - \u201eThe only thing I know \nfor certain is that these are bad people and I look forward to working closely with the \nBlair government to deal with the issue\u201f, and the ordinariness of these three men. \n \nThe film also foregoes explicit commentary, exposition or defence. In one sense it \ntells us little about the occupation of Afghanistan, and the expansion of the \u201ewar on \nterror\u201f with the subsequent invasion of Iraq, and little about the debates around \nextraordinary rendition, the US\u201fs rejection of international law in the treatment and \nrenaming of prisoners of war with the complicity of the \u201ecoalition of the willing\u201f. It \ntells us little about the debates around the circumstances in which torture might be \nlegally and ethically justified and whether information extracted under torture should \nbe used by western governments. The narrative focus throughout the film is on Asif, \nRuhel and Shafiq and their exclusion from the public sphere through their \nmisrecognition as Al Qaeda, Al Majaroun terrorists or Taliban soldiers. Apart from \nthe news clips, there are no scenes that don\u201ft feature at least one of the three men, \nwhether they are addressing the camera or are being represented by actors in the \ndramatized sequences.  \nAccording to Winterbottom, the dramatized sequences were \u201eall improvised\u201f, \nand the improvisations based on the transcripts of interviews with Iqbal, Ahmed and \nRasul by co-director Mat Whitecross (Anon. 2006b: 11). Inevitably there remains a \nlarge degree of conjecture in the dramatization of the accounts of the three men, \nalthough it seems that the function of these sequences is primarily illustrative \u2013 they \nshow us, more or less, what happened to these men and, in doing so, offer an account \nof the war in Afghanistan and the management of the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison that is \nunavailable from the perspective of western news and entertainment media. They \nmake visible what is hidden from view and in this respect dramatized documentary is \nsimply an expedient form that enables the film-makers to show what is practically \nunfilmable. \n \nIn their exclusion from public spaces, from contact with friends, family (and, for \nmuch of their time in captivity, fellow inmates), and from due legal treatment through \ntheir designation as \u201eenemy combatants\u201f, they were excluded from sight. Therefore, \nmuch of the film is given over to a depiction of what took place inside the \nGuant\u00e1namo bay prison, but while the experience of the inmates is shown to be \ndegrading and brutal, the film retains a certain ambivalence or detachment of tone \nthroughout these scenes. Thus, rather than inciting either outrage or impassioned \nempathy with the three men, the film draws attention to the increasingly bizarre, \nKafkaesque way in which they are treated during their detention. Watching the film \none has the growing sense that the primary function of the prison is not practical - to \nhold dangerous or useful people captive before trying and\/or punishing them \u2013 but \nthat it is an unregulated, interstitial space, a Sade-ian border-zone in which one group \nof people has been given licence to inflict physical and psychological violence upon \nanother group.  \nIn this respect Camp X-ray\/Camp Delta is a heterotopia, the counter-site that \nMichel Foucault argued could be found in every culture and \u201ein which the real sites, \nall the other real sites that can be found within the culture, are simultaneously \nrepresented, contested, and inverted\u201f (Foucault 1967). Heterotopic sites, Foucault \nsuggests, are not \u201efreely accessible like a public space\u201f, but, like rest homes and \npsychiatric hospitals, are isolated and restrictive: \u201eEither the entry is compulsory, like \na barracks or a prison, or else the individual has to submit to rites and purifications\u201f \n(Foucault 1967). Situated at a distance from the US mainland, on a Navy base, \nputatively outside international law, the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison is the epitome of a \nparadoxical heterotopic site \u2013 visible but hidden, highly regulated but unrestrained. \nThe sequences in which the men are taunted with pornographic magazines or shackled \nto an iron ring in the floor, and tormented with flashing strobe lights and deafeningly \nloud \u201eblack metal\u201f music are an indication of the way in which this heterotopic space \nexists as an inversion of normative culture. Heterotopias \u201ereflect and speak about\u201f the \nsocieties they are inversions of, Foucault suggests, and in the case of Camp X-ray, the \ntrappings of US consumer culture become means of torture rather than gratification \n(Foucault 1967).   \nThe Road to Guant\u00e1namo is concerned with making this obscure, partially \nveiled space visible from the perspective of three of its occupants. The decision to \nadhere to the three men\u201fs accounts nevertheless imposes some tight formal restrictions \non the film. A consequence of this restricted narrative perspective is that we learn next \nto nothing about the other occupants \u2013 guards or captives - of the prisons they find \nthemselves in. As Winterbottom explains, the film-makers wanted to avoid \u201etoo much \ndrama about the relations between the characters \u2013 we wanted to just tell the simple \nstory of what happened to them. It\u201fs more about their experiences as opposed to \ncreating a separate drama about what\u201fs going on in their heads\u201f (Anon. 2006b: 11). \nThe film is thus unconcerned with the motivations and exculpation of Iqbal, Ahmed \nand Rasul. Writing on the film\u201fs release, journalist Deborah Orr suggested that this \nomission constituted a \u201egaping hole\u201f, since: \n             \nonly hints were given about their lives before their trip, and the sort of young \nmen they were. They had been in some trouble with the law, so it's reasonable \nto infer that they were rebellious or thrill-seeking. Perhaps they wanted to take \nadvantage of the chaos in Afghanistan, and felt there might be opportunities to \nmake some money. Or maybe their support for their friend in his wish to \nmarry a village girl from Pakistan suggests difficulties with the freedom and \nindependence of Western women (Orr 2006). \n \nThis criticism is repeated by Ali Jaafar in stronger terms, as he suggests that, \n\u201eWinterbottom\u201fs stated desire to remain objective is less convincing in relation to The \nRoad to Guant\u00e1namo, however, where he allows explanations by the Tipton Three of \ntheir presence in Afghanistan to go unchallenged\u201f (Jaafar 2007: 25-6). The unstated \nimplication of these speculations about the three men \u2013 that Iqbal, Ahmed and Rasul \nmust somehow be responsible for having been arrested and tortured \u2013 is all too \npredictable. In their demands for the clear psychological characterization of \nmainstream cinema, or, effectively, for further interrogation of the three, both writers \nbetray a desire for reassurance that the global \u201ewar on terror\u201f is in fact being waged \nwith impartiality and precision. On the contrary, I would argue that a strength of the \nfilm is that it is comparatively indifferent to these three men except in so far as they \nare useful illustrations of a process of misrecognition.  \nRather, the film is about the political and legal processes, ideologies, \ninfrastructures and communications systems that are unable to recognize these men as \nanything other than dangerous people or \u201eenemy combatants\u201f. Jaafar suggests that \u201eA \nmajor weakness of the film is that it posits the three\u201fs innocence as the major plank of \nits argument against them, leaving unasked the more demanding question of whether \ntheir imprisonment would have been justified even had they been guilty\u201f (Jaafar 2007: \n26). However, the question of whether or not they are \u201eguilty\u201f is largely irrelevant \ngiven that, as the film stresses, they were liable to be recognized as \u201eguilty\u201f from the \nmoment they were captured (and, indeed, there is no clear consistent sense of what \nthey might have been guilty of). It is ironic and revealing that the responses of Orr and \nJaafar to the film appear, however circumspectly, to repeat this (mis-)recognition. \nThe film\u201fs title refers to the journey taken by Iqbal, Ahmed and Rasul \u2013 the \nseries of events that led to their imprisonment as \u201eenemy combatants\u201f \u2013 but  also, and \nmore importantly, it refers to the transformations that have led to a political sea \nchange in which, for example, Tony Blair felt able to dismiss the continuing existence \nof the prison and the several hundred inmates held without charge at a news \nconference in February 2006, as \u201ean anomaly\u201f that \u201esooner or later has to be dealt \nwith\u201f (Anon 2006a).8 As Winterbottom\u201fs comment on the film\u201fs embodiment of a \n\u201edouble perspective\u201f suggests, the Road to Guant\u00e1namo is not a self-contained \nnarrative but a partial and limited account of one particular sequence of events, and an \naccount that is one element of an inter-textual, multi-media assemblage of narratives. \nThe film assumes, in this mode of address, a knowledgeable spectator, and it assumes \nthat it is a contribution to a context in which debates about Guant\u00e1namo are ongoing, \ninviting us to infer connections between this film and other texts. Rather than a failure \nor a sign of incompetence, the refusal to offer a closed narrative is strategic and \nknowing, just as its refusal to interrogate or \u201eexcuse\u201f the three is deliberate and \nconsistent with an ethical decision not to speak on their behalf. \n \nConclusion \n \n                                                 \n8\n There is no doubt also a strategic dimension to this apparently careless comment since it also \ncarefully implies that Guant\u00e1namo is an exceptional space, rather than a space that is representative of \na general policy of the systematic abuse of prisoners and suspects that is deemed legitimate under the \n\u201ewar on terror\u201f. \nThus, The Road to Guant\u00e1namo engages with a specific public \u2013 an activist public, or, \nmore accurately it aims to activate or generate an activist public, and exploits \ndevelopments in media technology and consumer expectations to do this. The website \nset up by the film\u201fs US distributor, Roadside Attractions, for example, includes a page \ntitled \u201eGet Active\u201f, with links to human rights organizations and a downloadable \n\u201eAction Guide\u201f that contains background information about the Guant\u00e1namo Bay \nprison and advice about how to protest. As well as a means of distribution of the film, \nthe internet also provides a framing context to guide our interpretation and exhorts us \nto follow intertextual relays to other accounts and interventions. \nThe film\u201fs low budget, small crew, rapid production schedule with its reliance \nupon improvisation, and the simultaneous release of the film in different media \nformats also facilitate the film\u201fs address to a public, allowing the film to intervene in \nongoing debates. The film is concerned with a history that is still very much present \nfor its audience (even though the events and heterotopic locations of the film are \nlargely invisible to most of us) and so \u2013 potentially at least \u2013 in its spectatorial \nimmediacy the film can suggest the possibility of political action to its audience. \nWhere a film such as George Clooney\u201fs film about Ed Murrow, Good Night and \nGood Luck, which was released six months earlier and depicts politically scandalous \nevents from a safe historic distance can offer us the masochistic pleasures of outrage, \nempathy and disapproval, The Road to Guant\u00e1namo refuses to allow us this \ncomfortably disempowering historical distance or delay.\n9\n As Michael Warner has \nnoted, the potential for texts and discourses to agitate and activate a public is directly \nlinked to the speed of circulation of those texts and discourses:  \n                                                 \n9\n Although it is an account of US TV journalism in the early 1950s, director and co-writer Clooney has \nsuggested that Good Night and Good Luck is a cautionary comment upon the political function of \npresent-day media representations: \u201eI thought it was a good time to raise the idea of using fear to stifle \npolitical debate\u201f (Brooks, 2005). \n             \nA public can only act in the temporality of the circulation that gives it  \nexistence. The more punctual and abbreviated the circulation, and the more  \ndiscourse indexes the punctuality of its own circulation, the closer a public  \nstands to its politics. At longer rhythms or more continuous flows, action  \nbecomes harder to imagine. That is the fate of academic publics, a fact very  \nlittle understood when academics claim by intention or proclamation to be  \ndoing politics. In modernity, politics takes much of its character from the  \ntemporality of the headline, not the archive\u201f (Warner 2002: 96-7). \n \nI would argue that the form of The Road to Guant\u00e1namo, the circumstances of its \nproduction and its unprecedented distribution strategy are all determined by the \nimperative of a rapid response. Shot and edited digitally and released in multiple \nformats simultaneously, the film is able to address its audience with an urgency that \nwould be dissipated through the delays of the conventional circuits of distribution. \nConsequently, the film circulates within the temporality of the headline, rather than \nthat of the archive, or the standard \u201eplatform release\u201f schedules of the film industry. In \nthis respect, Winterbottom\u201fs recent observation, \u201eI see my role [\u2026] as similar to that \nof a journalist\u201f, reflects both  the changing patterns of film production, distribution \nand consumption, and also the sense that (some of) his films are equivalent in \nfunction, cultural status and ephemerality as media objects, to a news report (Jaafar \n2007: 25). \nThere is an interesting coda to the story of the Tipton three that demonstrates \nboth the way in which the film has become implicated in the history it recounts \n(through the speed with which it entered into circulation) and also the way in which \nthe public sphere in which the film circulates is so thoroughly mediated that the \nslippage between fiction and document extends beyond the boundaries of the film. \nThe Road to Guant\u00e1namo was premiered at the Berlin Film festival in February 2006 \nwhere it won the Silver Bear \u201eBest Director\u201f prize for Winterbottom and Whitecross. \nOn their return to Britain, Shafiq Rasul and Ruhel Ahmed, who had attended the \npremi\u00e8re screening and the accompanying press conference were held for questioning \nby police at Luton airport under the 2000 Terrorism act, along with the actors who \nplayed them in the film. In an episode that is both absurd and alarming, Riz Ahmed, \nwho played Rasul, claims he was asked about his views on the Iraq war, whether he \nbecame an actor to further the cause of Islam, whether he intended to make any more \n\u201epolitical\u201f films, and whether he was prepared to become a police informant (Grimmer \n2006). \nIn conclusion, what characterizes The Road to Guant\u00e1namo as an exemplary \nmodel of political cinema situated at the margins of mainstream film and television is \nits articulation of a sophisticated \u201edouble perspective\u201f. The film is conceived as a text \nor object that circulates within a crowded multi-media context and it functions as an \nintervention in the interwoven circuits of news and entertainment media, a polemical \nand partial account. The film also incorporates a doubled perspective into its internal \nstructural organization in several ways, including, most significantly, its blending of \ndocumentary and fiction in a self-conscious acknowledgement of the uncertain status \nof mediated representations. It avoids adopting a na\u00efve \u201enaturalism\u201f in its account of \nthe removal of certain individuals \u2013 border subjects - from public spaces and from \nvisibility. Thus, in making visible the experiences of these three men, as a text and a \ncommodity the film engages with audiences in a highly self-conscious way both \nthrough its differentiation from other media accounts and through its simultaneous \nrelease in different formats.  In making public the story of the Tipton three, this film \nby Winterbottom and Whitecross attempts to activate or make publics, by inciting \nthem to protest.  \n \nWorks cited \nAnon (2006a), \u201eBlair: Guant\u00e1namo is an anomaly\u201f, The Guardian, 17 February 2006.  \nhttp:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/guantanamo\/story\/0,,1712066,00.html.
