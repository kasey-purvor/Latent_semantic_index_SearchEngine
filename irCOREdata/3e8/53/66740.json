The critical state\nis the state achieved by a soil when it exhibits no changes in\nstress or volume when it is sheared; this is typically\nachieved at large strains. A soil that is looser (sometimes\nreferred to as wetter) than the critical state will contract in\nvolume under shear to achieve the critical state, or if volume\nchange is prevented (an undrained condition) then increases\nin pore water pressure will be generated so that the effective\nstress state moves towards the critical state. A soil that is\ndenser (or drier) than the critical state will dilate, or if\nvolume change is prevented then a decrease in pore water\npressure will be generated.\nThe behaviour of saturated soils is controlled by effective\nstresses, and for the saturated case water content and volume\nare interrelated. Therefore the saturated critical state can be\nexpressed through the deviator stress, q, the mean effective\nstress, p9, and the specific volume, v. At the critical state\nthese variables are related through three critical-state para-\nmeters, M, \u02c6 and \u00ba:\nq \u00bc Mp9 (1)\n\u0002 \u00bc \u02c6\u0003 \u00baln p9 (2)\nwhere M is the slope of the projection of the critical-state\nline in q\u2013 p9 space, \u02c6 is the intercept (at p9 \u00bc 1 kPa), and \u00ba\nis the slope of the projection of the critical-state line in\nv \u0003 ln p9 space.\nHowever, unsaturated soils have an additional phase (the\nair phase), and it is therefore no longer possible to interpret\ntheir behaviour through effective stresses, nor to assume that\nwater content and volume are linked. For unsaturated soils,\nthe stress state can be represented by two stress state\nvariables, the net stress (\u0003 \u0003 ua) and the matric suction\n(ua \u0003 uw) (Fredlund & Morgenstern, 1977), where ua is the\npore air pressure and uw is the pore water pressure. In\naddition to specific volume (or void ratio), the phase state of\nthe soil has to be represented by an additional variable: this\ncan be either gravimetric water content (w), volumetric water\ncontent (\u0141) or degree of saturation (Sr).\nToll (1990) proposed that the critical state for unsaturated\nsoils could be expressed in terms of q, p \u0003 ua, ua \u0003 uw, v\nand Sr. The unsaturated critical state requires five para-\nmeters, Ma, Mb, a\u02c6b, \u00baa and \u00baw:\nq \u00bc Ma p \u0003 ua\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe Mb ua \u0003 uw\u00f0 \u00de (3)\n\u0002 \u00bc a\u02c6b \u0003 \u00baaln p \u0003 ua\u00f0 \u00de \u0003 \u00babln ua \u0003 uw\u00f0 \u00de (4)\nNote that the contributions due to suction have been labelled\nMb and \u00bab (rather than the terminology Mw and \u00baw originally\nused by Toll, 1990). This is for consistency with the use of\n\u0005b by Fredlund et al. (1978) to represent the friction angle\nfor changes in matric suction. The terminology for the\nManuscript received 5 December 2001; revised manuscript accepted\n2 October 2002\nDiscussion on this paper closes 1 August 2003, for further details\nsee p. ii.\u0001 School of Engineering, University of Durham, UK.\n{ Formerly School of Civil and Structural Engineering, Nanyang\nTechnological University, Singapore.\ncontributions due to net stress (Ma and \u00baa) are already\nconsistent with the use of \u0005a by Fredlund et al. (1978).\nToll (1990) showed that, for a compacted lateritic gravel,\nMa, Mb, \u00baa and \u00bab did not have unique values for unsatu-\nrated conditions. It was shown that the variation in the\nparameters could be expressed as functions of the degree of\nsaturation, Sr. It was argued that it was not degree of\nsaturation per se that affected these parameters, but rather\nthe fabric of the soil. Clayey materials compacted dry of\noptimum moisture content develop an aggregated or \u2018packet\u2019\nfabric, and these effects can be observed even in a predomi-\nnantly granular material that has less than 10% clay. Toll\n(2000) showed that, for compacted soils, the degree of\nsaturation could give an indication of the amount of aggre-\ngation present.\nThis paper presents test data from triaxial tests on a\nresidual soil from Singapore, tested under unsaturated condi-\ntions with measurements of matric suction. The data for\ncritical-state conditions from these tests are presented within\nthe framework proposed by Toll (1990). The critical-state\nparameters for the Singapore residual soil are established\nand are compared with the pattern of behaviour for Kiunyu\ngravel reported by Toll (1990). Their variation is considered\nwith respect to degree of saturation and also volumetric\nwater content.\nCRITICAL-STATE STRESS RATIOS FOR UNSATURATED\nSOILS\nToll (1990) showed that, for a lateritic gravel (Kiunyu\ngravel), the values of the critical-state stress ratios Ma and\nMb varied in a manner that could be expressed as functions\nof the degree of saturation, Sr. Subsequent research has also\nidentified variations in the critical-state parameters due to\nchanges in suction. The results of tests on compacted kaolin\nby Zakaria et al. (1995) and Wheeler & Sivakumar (1995)\nshowed that the slope of the critical-state line in q, p \u0003 ua\nspace (that is, Ma) increased as suction increased. This\nwould be consistent with an increase in Ma with decreasing\ndegree of saturation (as degree of saturation will reduce as\nsuction increases). It is also consistent with other observa-\ntions that the friction angle for changes in net stress (that is,\n\u0005a) increased with increasing suction (Escario & Saez,\n1986), although these latter observations were not made for\ncritical-state conditions. However, Delage et al. (1987) and\nMaa\u02c6touk et al. (1995) found that, for silts, \u0005a decreased\nwith increased suction. Ng et al. (2000) found that Ma\nseemed to be constant and independent of the value of\nsuction for two loosely compacted volcanic fills. Neverthe-\nless, their values of Mb did show a clear variation with\ndegree of saturation, similar to that shown by Toll (1990).\nFigure 1 shows the functions for Ma and Mb as they relate\nto degree of saturation for Kiunyu gravel (Toll, 1990). Toll\n(2000) also expressed the critical-state parameters for Kiu-\nnyu gravel in terms of the friction angles \u0005a and \u0005b, and a\nscale for friction angles is shown in Fig. 1. These represent\nfriction angles at the critical state.\nAt lower degrees of saturation (dry of optimum water\ncontent), Ma has greater values than Ms (the stress ratio in\nsaturated conditions). This was explained by Toll (1990,\n2000) as being due to the presence of aggregations at lower\ndegrees of saturation, causing the soil to behave in a coarser\nfashion than would be justified by the grading. In unsatu-\nrated conditions the aggregated fabric can be maintained\nduring shear because the suction gives strength to the\naggregations. In a saturated soil, any aggregations that did\nexist would be broken down during shear and would not be\nexpected to affect the critical-state parameters. In any case,\nsamples compacted at high degrees of saturation (above\noptimum water content) would not be expected to have an\naggregated fabric.\nThe same mechanism could explain the drop in \u0005a for\nsilts observed by Delage et al. (1987) and Maa\u02c6touk et al.\n(1995). Silty materials would tend to desaturate at much\nlower suctions. At intermediate values of suction the aggre-\ngated fabric would be held together by the suction and could\ngive high angles of friction. However, as the suction in-\ncreases, the aggregations can progressively desaturate. The\ndesaturated parts would no longer be held together by\nsuction, and would break down. In this case the value of \u0005a\nwould drop as the aggregated fabric broke down. This same\nmechanism is likely to affect clayey soils, but at much\nhigher values of suction.\nIt can be seen from Fig. 1 that, at low degrees of\nsaturation, Mb becomes significantly lower than Ms and\neventually drops to zero. It could be that the packet fabric\nalso affects Mb as the water phase withdraws into the\npackets and suction makes no contribution to the overall\nstrength of the soil. It is also possible that this represents a\nsimilar effect to the reduction in the friction angle for\nsuction (\u0005b) as suction increases, as observed by Escario &\nSaez (1986) and Fredlund et al. (1987). This effect can be\nexplained by a reduction in the area of water over which the\nsuction acts (very like the \u0006 factor used by Bishop, 1959). It\nhas been shown by Fredlund et al. (1995) and Vanapalli et\nal. (1996) that the reduction of \u0005b can be related to normal-\nised volumetric water content or degree of saturation.\nThe variation in the Mb parameter with degree of satura-\ntion has been modelled using a function similar to those\nused by Vanapalli et al. (1996). The function used is\nMb\nMs\n\u00bc Sr \u0003 Sr2\nSr1 \u0003 Sr2\n\u0001 \u0002k\n(5)\nThe values for Mb=Ms are numerically very similar to the\nratio tan\u0005b\/tan\u00059 (as used by Fredlund et al. (1995) and\nVanapalli et al. (1996)), and can be treated as equivalent, so\nthe same function can be used whether stress ratios or\nfriction angles are being used. The function applies only for\nSr2 , Sr , Sr1: when Sr . Sr1 the ratio Mb=Ms is taken as\n1\u00b70, and when Sr , Sr2 it is taken as 0.\nVanapalli et al. used full saturation (that is, 100%) as the\nfirst reference state, Sr1, and the degree of saturation at\nresidual suction as the second reference state, Sr2. Here, the\ntwo reference states have been chosen to fit the experimental\nMa (\u03c6\na)\nMb (\u03c6\nb)\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\u03c6\n0 20 40 60 80 100\nSr: %\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\nM\nFig. 1.

To achieve this, values of Sr1 \u00bc 88%, Sr2 \u00bc 50% and\nk \u00bc 2:0 have been used, and the resulting function is shown\nin Fig. 1. Sr1 is the point where Mb \u00bc Ms, and Sr2 repre-\nsents the point where Mb \u00bc 0. The significance of these\npoints will be discussed later. The value of k \u00bc 2:0 provides\nthe required degree of curvature of the function between the\ntwo reference states. Fredlund et al. (1995) suggested that k\nshould be 1\u00b70 or greater. A value of 2\u00b70 is similar to that\nused by Vanapalli et al. (1996), where typically values of\n2\u00b72\u20132\u00b75 were found to be appropriate for a glacial till.\nA similar function has also been used to model the\nvariation in Ma. The function used is\nMa\nMs\n\u00bc Ma\nMs\n\u0001 \u0002\nmax\n\u0003 Ma\nMs\n\u0001 \u0002\nmax\n\u00031\n\" #\nSr \u0003 Sr2\nSr1 \u0003 Sr2\n\u0001 \u0002k\n(6)\nThis gives a function that varies from Ma=Ms \u00bc 1 at Sr1\nup to a maximum value of (Ma=Ms)max at Sr2. To fit the\nexperimental data, the same values of Sr1 \u00bc 88% and\nSr2 \u00bc 50% were appropriate (the same values used for fitting\nMb) with (Ma=Ms)max \u00bc 1:25. The value of k \u00bc 1:0 was\nused, since a linear relationship gives a better fit with the\nexperimental data.\nCRITICAL-STATE COMPRESSIBILITIES FOR\nUNSATURATED SOILS\nThe slopes of the critical-state surface in specific volume\nspace, \u00baa and \u00bab, like the stress ratios, do not have unique\nvalues. Toll (1990) suggested that they can be related to\ndegree of saturation. He also suggested that a\u02c6b in equation\n(4) could be related to s\u02c6 (the intercept for saturated condi-\ntions) through the degree of saturation:\na\u02c6b \u00bc 1 \u00fe s\u02c6 \u0003 1\nSr\n(7)\nAlonso et al. (1990) suggested that the compressibility in\nv, p \u0003 ua space (in their terminology, \u00ba(s)) could be related\nto the value at zero suction (\u00ba(0)) either through the\nlogarithm of suction or by an exponential function of\nsuction. This would suggest that the compressibility for net\nstress would reduce as suction increases. Experimental data\nfrom Matyas & Radhakrishnan (1968) and Cui & Delage\n(1996) show this to be the case.\nFor saturated soils it has been observed that the slope of\nthe critical-state line is parallel to the normal consolidation\nline. If we assume that this is also true for unsaturated soil,\nthe previous arguments concerning the normal consolidation\nsurface can be applied to the slope of the critical-state line.\nThis would suggest that \u00baa would reduce with an increase in\nsuction (that is, it would reduce as the degree of saturation\nreduces). This is not borne out by the observation of Toll\n(1990) that \u00baa would increase with a reduction in degree of\nsaturation, nor is it supported by other experimental evi-\ndence. Wheeler & Sivakumar (1995) found that the slope of\nthe critical-state line in the net stress plane increased as\nsuction increased. Ng et al. (2000) showed that \u00baa was\nconsiderably steeper for a suction of 80 kPa than for the\nzero suction condition. It is not clear whether this discre-\npancy means that the slope of the critical-state surface is\ndifferent from that of the normal consolidation surface, or\nwhether an increase in \u00baa with a reduction in degree of\nsaturation (or increase in suction) is due to the fabric of\ncompacted soils.\nFigure 2 shows the functions for \u00baa and \u00bab as they relate\nto degree of saturation for Kiunyu gravel (Toll, 1990). It\nwas argued that the presence of aggregations (and hence a\nmore open fabric) causes the soil to behave in a more\ncompressible fashion (with respect to net stress) than is\njustified by the grading. Therefore at lower degrees of\nsaturation (greater aggregation) \u00baa had greater values than \u00bas\n(the compressibility in saturated, non-aggregated conditions).\nAt low degrees of saturation \u00bab becomes significantly lower\nthan \u00bas, and at low water contents drops to zero. This could\nbe due to the packet fabric, reflecting the fact that the water\nphase withdraws into the packets and suction makes no\ncontribution to the compressibility of the soil. It is also\npossible that the effect is due to degree of saturation per se,\nreflecting the reduced normalised area of water over which\nthe suction acts, making the suction less effective in causing\nvolume change.\nTEST PROGRAMME\nConstant water content triaxial tests were carried out on\nunsaturated samples of the residual soil from Singapore. In\naddition, consolidated drained tests on saturated samples\nwere performed to define the saturated parameters. The soil\ntested was obtained from samples taken at a site adjacent to\nthe Nanyang Technological University, School of Civil and\nStructural Engineering (NTU-CSE), which is located in the\nJurong sedimentary deposit of Singapore. Samples were\ntaken from a depth of 4\u20135 m. Prior to testing, the soil was\nair-dried for two weeks and passed through a sieve with an\naperture size of 2\u00b736 mm. Some classification properties of\nthe soil (after removal of material , 2\u00b736 mm) are given in\nTable 1, and the grain size analysis is given in Fig. 3.\nComparable information is also given for Kiunyu gravel,\ntested by Toll (1990).\nThe Jurong soil was mixed at a water content of 15\u00b76%\n(1\u00b74% wet of optimum water content) and statically com-\npacted into a mould to obtain specimens of 100 mm height\nand 50 mm diameter. The intention was to produce speci-\nmens with a bulk density of 1\u00b797 Mg=m3 and a dry density\nof 1\u00b771 Mg=m3 (void ratio of 0\u00b76).

Full details of the specimen preparation\nare given by Ong (1999).\nThree drained triaxial tests were performed on saturated\nsamples of the Jurong soil. The samples were consolidated\nisotropically to effective confining stresses of 50, 100 and\n150 kPa. The shearing rate used was 0:009%=min, the same\nas that used in the constant water content tests on unsatu-\nrated samples. The results are plotted in Fig. 4.\nA series of 15 constant water content triaxial tests were\ncarried out on the Jurong soil. The axis-translation technique\nwas used to control and measure the matric suction. In this\ntechnique an elevated pore air pressure is used, so that the\npore water pressure becomes positive. A high air entry\nporous disc is used so that the pore water pressure can be\nmeasured independently of the pore air pressure. In this test\nseries, a porous ceramic with an air entry value of 500 kPa\nwas used. Pore water pressure was measured at the base of\nthe specimen. A diffused air volume indicator as described\nby Fredlund & Rahardjo (1993) was used to remove air\nbubbles from the pore water pressure measuring system\nbefore shearing.\nAfter compaction, specimens were initially saturated by\napplying an elevated back pressure. The specimens were\nthen allowed to equilibrate under appropriate values of iso-\ntropic confining pressure, \u00033, pore air pressure, ua, and pore\nwater pressure, uw, as shown in Table 2. Net confining\nstresses (\u00033 \u0003 ua) were set at 50, 150 or 250 kPa. Matric\nsuctions (ua \u0003 uw) varied from 170 to 400 kPa. The speci-\nmens were then sheared under constant water content condi-\ntions (that is, preventing any flow of water in or out of the\nspecimen). However, the specimens could still change in\nvolume owing to flow of air. The specimen volume was\ndetermined by measuring the volume of flow in or out of\nJurong soil Kiunyu gravel\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nP\ner\nce\nnt\n fi\nne\nr\n0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10\nParticle diameter: mm\nClay Silt Sand Gravel\nFig. 3.

A correction was applied to\nallow for the downward movement of the loading ram.\nA constant strain rate of 0:009%=min was applied to the\nspecimens. This rate was chosen after a pilot study by Ong\n(1999) showed that this rate (and lower) gave consistent\nreadings of matric suctions in constant water content tests.\nThe results for tests carried out at a net stress of 50 kPa\nare plotted in Fig. 5. Similar plots for tests carried out at\na net stress of 150 kPa are shown in Fig. 6. The results\nfor tests carried out at a net stress of 250 kPa are shown in\nFig. 7.\nTHE SATURATED CRITICAL STATE FOR JURONG SOIL\nThe saturated critical state provides a useful reference for\nthe unsaturated critical state. Therefore, initially data from\nsaturated tests and those for constant water content tests that\nachieved high degrees of saturation (greater than 90% at the\nend of the tests) will be considered in order to give indica-\ntions of the saturated critical-state values. At high degrees of\nsaturation the pore air phase exists as occluded air bubbles,\nand it is acceptable to analyse the soil behaviour from\nunsaturated tests in terms of effective stresses. This provides\nadditional information to extend the findings obtained from\nthe limited number of tests carried out on saturated samples.\nThe five constant water content tests that reached high\ndegrees of saturation at the end of the tests were cw50-170,\ncw50-200, cw150-220, cw150-240 and cw250-280. These\ntests achieved degrees of saturation between 91% and 93%.\nTherefore the results of these five tests can be analysed in\nterms of effective stresses. The results for cw50-170 and\ncw50-200 (with net stress of 50 kPa and suctions of 170 and\n200 kPa respectively) are shown in Fig. 5. Results for\ncw150-220 and cw150-240 (with net stress of 150 kPa and\nsuctions of 220 and 240 kPa respectively) are shown in Fig.\n6, and the result for cw250-280 (with net stress of 250 kPa\nand suction of 280 kPa) is shown in Fig. 7.\nThe saturated drained tests (cd50, cd100 and cd150) (Fig.\n4) show that both the deviator stress and the volume strain\nlevelled off at axial strains of 12\u201315%, meaning that a true\ncritical state is achieved. It can be seen that for the constant\nwater content tests, cw50-170 and cw50-200 (Fig. 5), the\nvolume strain shows a tendency to level off at an axial strain\nabove 10%, suggesting that the critical state is being ap-\nproached. However, the deviator stress and the pore water\npressure are still changing towards the end of the tests. A\nsimilar picture is seen for cw150-220 (Fig. 6) and cw250-\n280 (Fig. 7).\nTable 2.

However, the rate of change\nof these parameters did generally reduce considerably to-\nwards the end of the test. In some cases the deviator stress\ncontinued to increase (and the pore water pressure to de-\ncrease), but by the end of the test the stress path followed a\nconstant stress ratio (q= p9). This can be seen in the stress\npaths shown in Fig. 8. It is always difficult to define a true\ncritical-state condition for bonded or dense materials as they\noften fail through the development of distinct shear surfaces,\nwhere non-homogeneous deformations (and the possibility\nfor clay particle alignment) will affect the results. Neverthe-\nless, for the purpose of this discussion it will be assumed\nthat the ultimate stress ratio (q=p9) defines the critical-state\ncw150-400\ncw150-300\ncw170-350\ncw150-240\ncw150-220cw150-260\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n0\n100\nq:\n k\nP\na\n0.0 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0\nAxial strain: %\n(a)\ncw150-400\ncw150-300\ncw150-350\ncw150-240\ncw150-220\ncw150-260\n0.0 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0\nAxial strain: %\n(b)\ncw150-400\ncw150-300\ncw150-350\ncw150-240\ncw150-220\ncw150-260\n0.0 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0\nAxial strain: %\n(c)\n300\n200\n100\n0\n\u03b4u\n: k\nP\na\n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\nV\nol\num\ne \nst\nra\nin\n: %\nFig. 6.

Stress paths in q2 p9 space for saturated drained tests\nand constant water content tests at high degrees of saturation\n98 TOLL AND ONG\nstress ratio, M. The saturated tests (cd50, cd100, cd150)\nclearly define M, as they failed in a ductile fashion.\nThe q=p9 ratios for the three saturated drained tests and\nfive constant water content tests at high degrees of saturation\nare shown in Fig. 9. The saturated drained tests show a\nconsistent ultimate q= p9 ratio with a value of 1\u00b723. There is\nconsiderable variation in the ultimate stress ratios for the\nfive constant water content tests, as can be seen in Fig. 8.\nThe values range from 0\u00b794 in test cw150-240 to 1\u00b737 in test\ncw50-170. There does seem to be a trend of reducing q=p9\nratio with increasing suction, but with these limited data it is\ndifficult to be sure. It is likely that higher suctions produce\nmore brittle behaviour (and hence the formation of distinct\nfailure surfaces), and this is reflected in the lower q=p9\nvalues. However, the ultimate value of q=p9 for the saturated\ndrained tests of 1\u00b723 will be taken as the saturated value of\nM.\nThe volumetric behaviour of the three saturated drained\ntests and the five constant water content tests at high degrees\nof saturation is shown in Fig. 10. The end point of each test\nis shown by a h symbol. A line is drawn on the figure\nrepresenting the projection of the critical-state line (CSL) in\ne\u2013log p9 space. The line drawn represents values of \u02c6 of 2\u00b70\nand \u00ba of 0\u00b708.\nThe three saturated drained tests (cd50, cd100 and cd150)\nshow contractive behaviour throughout. Similarly, the four\nconstant water content tests that start above the CSL (cw50-\n170, cw50-200, cw150-220 and cw250-280) show contrac-\ntive behaviour. Test cw150-240, which starts with a void\nratio denser than the critical state, shows strong dilative\nbehaviour in the latter stages of the test. This difference in\nstate for test cw150-240 (that is, starting below the CSL)\nexplains why this test shows such a different stress path in\nFig. 8.\nIn conclusion, the test results for saturated tests and those\nat high degrees of saturation provide values for the saturated\ncritical-state parameters of M \u00bc 1:23, \u02c6 \u00bc 2:0 and \u00ba \u00bc 0:08.\nTHE UNSATURATED CRITICAL STATE FOR JURONG\nSOIL\nTable 3 shows the values of the stress state variables\n(q, p \u0003 ua and ua \u0003 uw) and the phase state variables (w, e\nand Sr) at the end of each test. It can be seen that the degree\nof saturation at the end of the tests varies from 93% down\nto 61%.\nBy examining the values of q, p \u0003 ua and ua \u0003 uw it is\npossible to assess values of Ma and Mb from equation (3). It\nwas assumed that these values would relate to the degree of\nsaturation, as suggested by Toll (1990). An initial assump-\ntion was made that Ma was constant and equal to Ms,\nindependent of Sr. Values of Mb were then determined so\nthat the predicted value of deviator stress, q, calculated from\nequation (3) (based on the observed values of p \u0003 ua and\nua \u0003 uw) was equal to the observed value of q. This initial\nassessment gave a distribution of values of Mb that did not\nshow a consistent function with degree of saturation. The\nvalues of Ma were then adjusted by trial and error and new\nvalues of Mb calculated so that reasonably consistent func-\ntions of both Ma and Mb were achieved. The results of this\nassessment are shown in Fig. 11.\nAlthough there is some scatter in Fig. 11, the predominant\ntrends are reasonably clear. The values of Ma and Mb for the\ntests at high degrees of saturation are seen to be equal to\neach other, and range from 0\u00b794 to 1\u00b737, scattering around\nthe value for Ms of 1\u00b723 as discussed in the previous section.\nAs the degree of saturation reduces, the values of Mb drop\nconsiderably, and reach values less than 0\u00b71 at a degree of\nsaturation near 60%. Conversely, the values of Ma appear to\nincrease with reducing degree of saturation. This is consis-\ntent with the pattern observed by Toll (1990).\nThe functions shown by lines in Fig. 11 are given by\nequation (5) using the same values of Sr1 \u00bc 88%, Sr2 \u00bc 50%\nand k \u00bc 2:0 as used for Kiunyu gravel, but are now based\non an Ms value of 1\u00b723 appropriate for the Jurong soil. It\ncan be seen that the functions give a very reasonable fit to\nthe data obtained for the Jurong sedimentary soil. This\nsuggests that the form of the function may be common to a\nrange of soil types, as the same form fits both a lateritic\ngravel and a residual sandy clay. These functions, expressed\nas the normalised variables Ma=Ms and Mb=Ms, are plotted\nin Fig. 12.\nBy examining the values of e, p \u0003 ua and ua \u0003 uw it is\npossible to assess values of \u00baa and \u00bab from equation (4).\nValues of a\u02c6b were calculated from the value of s\u02c6 and Sr\nusing equation (7). As before, it was assumed that the values\nof \u00baa and \u00bab would relate to the degree of saturation.

Like the functions for Ma=Ms\nand Mb=Ms, this suggests that the form of the functions for\n\u00baa=\u00bas and \u00bab=\u00bas may be common to a range of soil types.\nThese functions, expressed as the normalised variables \u00baa=\u00bas\nand \u00baw=\u00bas, are plotted in Fig. 14.\nFUNCTIONS USING VOLUMETRIC WATER CONTENT\nThe functions for the critical-state stress ratios, expressed\nas the normalised variables Ma=Ms and Mb=Ms (Fig. 12),\nhave so far been expressed in terms of degree of saturation\nusing equations (5) and (6). The form of these functions has\nalso been investigated in terms of volumetric water content.\nThis has the advantage that it can be related to the soil\u2013\nwater characteristic curve when expressed in terms of volu-\nmetric water content, an approach that has been favoured by\nTable 3.

Their significance will be discussed in the\nfollowing.\nThe Ma values were modelled using the following function\n(similar to equation (6)):\nMa\nMs\n\u00bc Ma\nMs\n\u0001 \u0002\nmax\n\u0003 Ma\nMs\n\u0001 \u0002\nmax\n\u00031\n\" #\n\u00a8k (9)\nThe values of \u0141p1 and \u0141p2 that best fitted the Kiunyu gravel\ndata (for both Mb and Ma) were \u0141p1 \u00bc 0:27 and \u0141p2 \u00bc 0:43.\nFor the Jurong soil, \u0141p1 \u00bc 0:18 and \u0141p2 \u00bc 0:33. In both cases\na value of k \u00bc 2:0 was used for Mb and k \u00bc 1:0 for Ma (the\nsame values as used for fitting degree of saturation data).\nThe results are plotted in terms of volumetric water content\nin Fig. 15, and can be seen to give a realistic fit to the data.\nThe data for both materials are also plotted in terms of\nnormalised water content, \u00a8, in Fig. 16. The curvature of\nthe Mb function can be clearly seen (modelled with k \u00bc 2:0)\ncompared with the linear function for Ma (using k \u00bc 1:0). It\ncan be seen that both sets of data fit the same functions in\nterms of normalised volumetric water content, as did the\ndegree of saturation functions (Fig. 12).\nSoil\u2013water characteristic curves determined from pressure\nplate tests are shown for both Kiunyu gravel and Jurong soil\nin Fig. 17. The test equipment in both cases was limited to\na maximum matric suction of 500 kPa. This means that the\nresidual suction cannot be defined as it is clear that both\nsoil\u2013water characteristic curves continue to show significant\nchanges in volumetric water content up to the limit of the\ntest data. However, the curve for the Jurong soil does show\nthe slope of the curve decreasing at suctions above 200 kPa.\nThe values of \u0141p1 and \u0141p2 for the Jurong soil have been\nindicated in Fig. 17. It can be seen that \u0141p1 is close to the\nair entry value for the soil, possibly representing the end of\nthe boundary effect zone and the start of the primary\ntransition zone as defined by Vanapalli et al. (1996). \u0141p2\ncoincides with the break in slope of the curve at 200 kPa,\npossibly representing the end of the primary transition zone.\nUnfortunately, the limit on suction for the test on Kiunyu\ngravel means that only the initial part of the curve is\nidentified. The value of \u0141p1 is shown and falls on the initial\npart of the soil\u2013water characteristic, again possibly repre-\nsenting the start of the primary transition zone. The value of\n\u0141p2 falls outside the experimental results, so no conclusions\ncan be drawn for the Kiunyu gravel.\nIt is clear that the two reference states (\u0141p1 and \u0141p2)\nneeded to define the function for variations in the stress\nratios do not coincide with saturation (\u0141s) and residual\nconditions (\u0141r), as suggested by Fredlund et al.

These can\nbe referenced to the saturated critical-state parameters Ms, s\u02c6\nand \u00bas. The variation in critical-state stress ratios (Ma and\nMb) and the critical-state compressibilities (\u00baa and \u00bab) can\nbe expressed as functions of the degree of saturation of the\nsoil.\nResults from constant water content tests on unsaturated\nsamples of soils from the Jurong residual soil in Singapore\nhave been used to determine the critical-state parameters for\nthe soil in an unsaturated state. Tests on saturated specimens\nindicate saturated critical-state parameters of Ms \u00bc 1:23,\ns\u02c6 \u00bc 2:0 and \u00bas \u00bc 0:08. At high degrees of saturation\nMa \u00bc Mb \u00bc Ms. At lower degrees of saturation the value of\nMb drops considerably, and reaches a value near to zero at\ndegrees of saturation below 60%. Conversely, the value of\nMa appears to increase with reducing degree of saturation.\nThis is consistent with the pattern observed by Toll (1990).\nA similar pattern is observed for \u00baa and \u00bab. At high\ndegrees of saturation \u00baa \u00bc \u00bab \u00bc \u00bas. As the degree of satura-\ntion reduces the value of \u00bab drops, and reaches a value near\nto zero at degrees of saturation below 60%. Conversely, the\nvalue of \u00baa clearly increases significantly with reducing\ndegree of saturation, as observed by Toll (1990).\nThe functions relating the critical-state parameters to\ndegree of saturation can be expressed in normalised form by\nreferencing them to the saturated state. The same normalised\nfunctions for Ma=Ms, Mb=Ms, \u00baa=\u00bas and \u00bab=\u00bas fit the\nexperimental data for the Jurong residual soil from Singa-\npore and also the data for a lateritic gravel from Kenya\nreported by Toll (1990). This suggests that the form of these\nfunctions may be common to a range of different soil types.\nThe functions can also be expressed in terms of normal-\nised volumetric water content. It seems from limited data\nthat the two reference states needed for normalisation may\nbe defined by the start and end of the primary transition\nzone identified from the soil\u2013water characteristic curve.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nBoth authors would like to acknowledge the role of\nAssociate Professor H.
