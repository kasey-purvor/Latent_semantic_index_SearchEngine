Integral field spec-\ntroscopy allows the complex kinematics of this object to be\nrevealed without the ambiguities or errors inherent in slit\nspectroscopy (e.g. Bacon 2000) and provides high observ-\ning efficiency since all the spectroscopic data is obtained\nsimultaneously in a few pointings. The use of fibre bundles\ncoupled to close-packed lenslet arrays offers not only high\nthroughput for each spatial sample, but also unit filling fac-\ntor to maximise the overall observing efficiency and reduce\nthe effect of sampling errors. The GMOS Integral Field Unit,\na module which converts the Gemini Multiobject Spectro-\ngraph (Allington-Smith et al. 2002) installed at the Gemini-\nnorth telescope, from slit spectroscopy to integral field spec-\ntroscopy (the first such device on a 8-10m telescope) offers\nan opportunity to gather data on this archetypal object at\nvisible wavelengths in a completely homogeneous way with\nwell-understood and unambiguous sampling.\nIn this paper we present a datacube covering the central\n\u22c6 E-mail: joris.gerssen@durham.ac.uk\n\u2020 Current address: e2v technologies (uk) ltd, 106 Waterhouse\nLane, Chelmsford, Essex, CM1 2QU, UK\n10 \u00d7 8 arcsec of NGC 1068 over a wavelength range from\n4200 \u2013 5400 A\u02da obtained during the commissioning run of\nthe GMOS IFU in late 2001.\nBelow we briefly summarize the key morphological char-\nacteristics of NGC 1068 (see also Antonucci, 1993; Krolik &\nBegelman, 1988). Although the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068\nresembles an ordinary Sb type galaxy at its largest scales,\nthe central region exhibits considerable complexity. Figure 1\nshows a CO map reproduced from Schinnerer et al. (2000)\ndetailing the structure on a 1 kpc scale. Two inner spiral\narms and the inner stellar bar first recognized by Scoville et\nal. (1988, see also Thatte et al., 1997) can clearly be seen.\nThe position angle of the galaxy\u2019s major axis (measured at\nD25 = 70 arcsec) is indicated by the dashed line. The cen-\ntral CO ring with a diameter of about five arcsec is roughly\naligned with this axis. The field covered by our GMOS-IFU\nobservations is indicated in the figure. The galaxy\u2019s distance\nthroughout this paper is assumed to be 14.4 Mpc, yielding\na scale of 70 pc per arcsec.\nAt subarcsecond scales, radio interferometer observa-\ntions (Gallimore et al. 1996) show a triple radio component\nwith a NE approaching synchrotron-emitting jet and a SW\nreceding jet. Hubble Space Telescope observations (HST) by\nMacchetto et al. (1994) in [OIII] emission show a roughly\n2 J. Gerssen et al.\nFigure 1. The field-of-view (10.3\u00d7 7.9 arcsec) of the mosaicked\nGMOS IFU data is outlined (black rectangle) on a CO map (with\nthe axes is arcsec) of the centre of NGC 1068 reproduced from\nSchinnerer et al. 2000. The CO map illustrates the central com-\nplexity in this galaxy with an inner spiral, an inner bar (PA= 48\u25e6)\nand a central CO ring. Also indicated is the position angle of the\ngalaxy\u2019s major axis (dashed line) at PA= 80\u25e6. At the assumed\ndistance of 14.4 Mpc to NGC 1068, 1 arcsec corresponds to 70\npc.\nNorth-South oriented v-shaped region with various sub-\ncomponents. With the exception of the central component,\nthere seems to be no immediate correspondence between the\n[OIII] components and the radio components. More recent\nHST observations (Groves et al. 2004; Cecil et al. 2002) re-\nveal the presence of numerous compact knots with a range of\nkinematics and inferred ionising processes. Recent infrared\ninterferometer observations (Jaffe et al. 2004) have identi-\nfied a 2.1\u00d73.4 pc dust structure that is identified as the torus\nthat hides the central AGN from view (e.g. Peterson, 1997).\nIn section 2, we give details of the observations and\nconstruction of the datacube. The datacube is analysed to\ndecompose the emission lines into multiple components in\nSection 3, which also includes a brief examination of the\nmain features that this reveals. In section 4, we use the stel-\nlar absorption features to constrain a model of the stellar\ndisk and make associations between this and components in\nthe emission line analysis.\n2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\nThe GMOS IFU (Allington-Smith et al. 2002) is a fiber-\nlenslet system covering a field-of-view of 5 \u00d7 7 arcsec with\na spatial sampling of 0.2 arcsec. The IFU records 1000 con-\ntiguous spectra simultaneously and an additional 500 sky\nspectra in a secondary field located at 1.0 arcmin from the\nprimary field.\nThe NGC 1068 observations on 9 Sep 2001 consist of 4\nexposures of 900s. obtained with the B600 grating set to a\ncentral wavelength of 4900 A\u02da and the g\u2032 filter (required to\nprevent overlaps in the spectra from each of the two pseu-\ndoslits into which the field is reformatted). The wavelength\nrange in each spectrum was 4200 \u2013 5400 A\u02da. The seeing was\n0.5 arcsec. Between exposures the telescope pointing was off-\nset by a few arcsec to increase the covered area on the sky\nand to improve the spatial sampling. The pointing offsets\nfrom the centre of the GMOS field followed the sequence:\n(-1.75,+1.50), (-1.75,-3.00), (+3.50,+0.00), (+0.00,+3.00)\narcsec.\nThe data were reduced using pre-release elements of the\nGMOS data reduction package (Miller et al. 2002 contains\nsome descriptions of the IRAF scripts). This consisted of the\nfollowing stages.\n\u2022 Geometric rectification. This joins the three individual\nCCD exposure (each of 4608 \u00d7 2048 pixels) into a single\nsynthesised detector plane, applying rotations and offsets\ndetermined from calibration observations. At the same time,\na global sensitivity correction is applied to allow for the dif-\nferent gain settings of the CCDs. Before this, the electronic\nbias was removed.\n\u2022 Sensitivity correction. Exposures using continuum illu-\nmination provided by the Gemini GCAL calibration unit\nwere processed as above. GCAL is designed to simulate the\nexit pupil of the telescope in order to remove calibration er-\nrors due to the illumination path. Residual large-scale errors\nwere very small and were removed with the aid of twilight\nflatfield exposures. The mean spectral shape and the slit\nfunction (which includes the effect of vignetting along the\ndirection of the pseudo-slit) were determined and used to\ngenerate a 2-D surface which was divided into the data to\ngenerate a sensitivity correction frame which removes both\npixel-pixel variations in sensitivity, including those due to\nthe different efficiencies of the fibres, and longer-scale vi-\ngnetting loss in the spatial direction.\n\u2022 Spectrum extraction. Using the continuum calibration\nexposures, the 1500 individual spectra were traced in disper-\nsion across the synthesised detector plane. The trace coeffi-\ncients were stored for application to the science exposures.\nUsing these, the spectra were extracted by summing with in-\nterpolation in the spatial direction a number of pixels equal\nto the fibre pitch around the mean coordinate in the spa-\ntial direction. Although the spectra overlap at roughly the\nlevel of the spatial FWHM, resulting in cross-talk between\nadjacent fibres at the pseudoslit, the effect on spatial reso-\nlution is negligible since fibres which are adjacent at the slit\nare also adjacent in the field and the instrumental response\nof each spaxel is roughly constant. Furthermore it has no\nimpact on the conditions for Nyquist sampling since this is\ndetermined at the IFU input (where > 2 spaxels samples the\nseeing disk FWHM) and not at the pseudo-slit. However the\noverlaps permit much more efficient utilisation of the avail-\nable detector pixels resulting in a larger field of view for the\nsame sampling (see Allington-Smith and Content 1998 for\nfurther details).\n\u2022 Construction of the datacube. Spectra from the differ-\nent pointings were assembled into individual datacubes. The\nspectra were first resampled onto a common linear wave-\nlength scale using a dispersion relationship determined from\n42-47 spectral features detected in a wavelength calibration\nobservation. From the fitting residuals we estimate an RMS\nuncertainty in radial velocity of 8 km\/s. The offsets be-\nGMOS IFU observations of the stellar and gaseous kinematics in the centre of NGC 1068 3\n    4989 Angstrom     4997 Angstrom     5004 Angstrom     5011 Angstrom     5019 Angstrom     5026 Angstrom     5033 Angstrom\n    4844 Angstrom     4851 Angstrom     4858 Angstrom     4865 Angstrom     4872 Angstrom     4880 Angstrom     4887 Angstrom\nFigure 2. The top panels (each covering an area of 10.3 x 7.3 arcsec) show a series of one Angstrom wide wavelength slices through the\ndata across the brightest [OIII] line. Across this line the central morphology of NGC 1068 develops various subcomponents. A similar\nchange in morphology is witnessed across all other emission lines as illustrated by the next series of panels that show the emission\ndistribution across the H\u03b2 line.\ntween exposures were determined from the centroid of the\nbright point-like nucleus in each datacube, after summing in\nwavelength. The constituent datacubes were then co-added\nusing interpolation onto a common spatial grid. The spa-\ntial increment was 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 arcsec to minimise sampling\nnoise due to both the hexagonal sampling pattern of the\nIFU and the offsets not being exact multiples of the IFU\nsampling increments. The resampling does not significantly\ndegrade spatial resolution since the resampling increment is\nmuch smaller than the Nyquist limit of the IFU. Since the\nspectra had a common linear wavelength scale within each\ndatacube, no resampling was required in the spectral do-\nmain. Cosmic ray events were removed by identifying pixels\nwhere the data value significantly exceeded that estimated\nfrom a fit to neighbouring pixels. The parameters of the pro-\ngram were set conservatively to avoid false detections. Since\neach spectrum spans \u223c5 pixels along the slit, distinguishing\nsingle-pixel events such as cosmic rays from emission lines\nwhich affect the full spatial extent of the spectrum is quite\nsimple. After this the exposures were checked by eye and a\nfew obvious low-level events removed manually using local\ninterpolation.\n\u2022 Background subtraction. Spectra from the offset field\nwere prepared in the same way as for the object field above,\ncombined by averaging and used to subtract off the back-\nground sky signal. The sky lines were relatively weak in this\nobservation so the accuracy of this procedure was not criti-\ncal.\nThe result is a single merged, sky-subtracted datacube\nwhere the value at each point is proportional to the detected\nenergy at a particular wavelength, \u03bb, for a 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 arcsec\nsample of sky at location x, y. The fully reduced and mo-\nsaicked NGC 1068 GMOS IFU data cube covers an area on\nthe sky of 10.3 \u00d7 7.9 arcsec with a spatial sampling of 0.1\narcsec per pixel and spectral resolving power of 2500. The\nwavelength range covered was 4170 \u2013 5420 A\u02da sampled at\n0.456 A\u02da intervals.\nThe change in atmospheric dispersion over the wave-\nlength range studied is less than 1 spaxel so no correction\nhas been applied. The spectra were not corrected to a scale\nof flux density since this was not required for subsequent\nanalysis\n3 EMISSION LINE DATA\nThe morphology of the central region changes rapidly across\nthe emission lines. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 showing a se-\nries of monochromatic slices. The emission lines appear to\nconsist of multiple components whose relative flux, disper-\nsion and radial velocity change with position.\n3.1 Empirical multi-component fits\nTo understand the velocity field of the line-emitting gas,\nwe made multicomponent fits to the H\u03b2 emission line. This\nwas chosen in preference to the brighter O[III] \u03bb\u03bb 4959, 5007\ndoublet because of its relative isolation and because the sig-\nnal\/noise was sufficient for detailed analysis. The fits were\nperformed on the spectra extracted for each spatial sam-\nple from the sky-subtracted and wavelength-calibrated dat-\nacube after it had been resampled to 0.2\u00d70.2 arcsec covering\na field of 8.6\u00d7 6 arcsec and 4830 \u2013 4920 A\u02da in wavelength to\nisolate the H\u03b2 line. The resampling made the analysis easier\nby reducing the number of datapoints without loss of spatial\ninformation.\nThe continuum was found to be adequately fit by a\nlinear function estimated from clean areas outside the line\nprofile. A program was written to fit up to 6 Gaussian com-\nponents, each characterised by its amplitude, A, radial ve-\nlocity, v and velocity dispersion, \u03c3. The Downhill Simplex\n4 J. Gerssen et al.\nmethod of Nelder and Mead (1965) was used. This minimises\n\u03c72 evaluated as\n\u03c72 =\nM\u2211\ni=1\n(\nFi \u2212 f(xi;Ai, \u00b5i, \u03c3i...AN , \u00b5N , \u03c3N )\nsi\n)\n(1)\nwhere Fi is the value of the ith datapoint. M is the number\nof datapoints in the fit and\nf(xi) =\nN\u2211\nj=1\nAj exp\n[\n\u2212\n(xi \u2212 \u00b5j)\n2\n2\u03c32j\n]\n(2)\nis the sum of N Gaussian functions. The radial velocity and\nvelocity dispersion are determined from \u00b5 and \u03c3 respectively.\nThe noise, s, in data numbers was estimated empirically\nfrom the data as a sum of fixed and photon noise as\nsi = H\n\u221a\nFi\nG\n+ s2R (3)\nwhere the detector gain G = 2.337 and the readout noise\nis sR = 3.3. The parameter H = 1.06 represents the effect\nof unknown additional sources of error and was chosen to\nprovide satisfactory values of Q (see below) for what were\njudged by eye to be good fits.\nThe significance of the fit was assessed via Q(\u03c72|\u03bd)\nwhich is the probability that \u03c72 for a correct model will\nexceed the measured \u03c72 by chance. The number of degrees\nof freedom, \u03bd =M \u2212 3N . Q is evaluated as\nQ(\u03c72|\u03bd) = Q(\u03bd\/2, \u03c72\/2) =\n1\n\u0393(\u03bd\/2)\n\u222b\n\u221e\n\u03c72\/2\nexp(\u2212t)t\n\u03bd\n2\n\u22121dt (4)\nwith limiting values Q(0|\u03bd) = 1 and Q(\u221e|\u03bd) = 0.\nFits were attempted at each point in the field with 1 6\nN 6 Nmax = 6, with N increasing in unit steps until Q \u2243\n1.0. The fits were additionally subject to various constraints\nto preclude unphysical or inherently unreliable fits, such as\nthose with line width less than the instrumental dispersion\n(\u03c3 < 0.9 pixels) or so large as to be confused with errors\nin the baseline subtraction (\u03c3 > 0.5M ). The final value of\nthe fit significance (not always) unity was recorded as Qmax.\nThe fits at each datapoint were examined visually and in the\nsmall number of cases, where the fits were not satisfactory, a\nbetter fit was obtained with an initial choice of parameters\nchosen by the operator.\nThe uncertainty in the resulting radial velocities taking\ninto account random and systematic calibration errors was\nestimated to be \u03c3 = 30 kms\u22121. Examples of fits are shown\nin Fig. 3.\nThe distribution of Qmax and Nmax over the GMOS\nfield-of-view suggests that most fits within the region of the\nsource where the signal level is high are reliable but some\npoints near the nucleus have lower reliability, perhaps be-\ncause the required number of components exceeds Nmax.\nThis is not surprising in regions where the signal\/noise ratio\nis very high. There is a clear trend to greater numbers of\ncomponents in the brighter (nuclear) regions of the object.\nThis is likely to be due to the higher signal\/noise in the\nbrighter regions but may also reflect genuinely more com-\nplex kinematics in the nuclear region. An atlas of fits for\neach datapoint in the field of view with N > 1 is given in\nelectronic form in the appendix.\nFigure 3. The normalized emission line profiles (black) obtained\nat various locations along a transect that coincides with the posi-\ntion angle of the jets. The individual Gaussian components whose\nsum best-fits the observed line profile are shown in different line\nstyles. The red line shows the sum of the individual components.\n3.2 Steps towards interpretation\nGarcia-Lorenzo et al. (1999) and Emsellem et al. (2005)\nidentified three distinct kinematical components in their\n[OIII] and H\u03b2 data based on line width. Our GMOS data\nobtained at a finer spatial and spectral resolution paints\na considerably more complex picture. At even finer spatial\nresolution, HST spectroscopic data (e.g. Cecil et al. 2002;\nGroves et al. 2004) obtained with multiple longslit positions\nand narrow-band imaging adds further complexity, includ-\ning features not seen in our data in which individual clouds\ncan be identified and classified by their kinematics.\nHowever, the HST longslit data must be interpreted\nwith caution since it is not homogeneous in three dimen-\nsions and cannot be assembled reliably into a datacube.\nMaking direct links between features seen in our data with\nthose of these other authors is not simple, but subjective and\nambiguous. This clearly illustrates how our understanding\nof even this accessible, archetypal galaxy is still strongly\nconstrained by the available instrumentation despite recent\nmajor advances in integral-field spectroscopy and other 3D\ntechniques.\nThe atlas of multicomponent fits to the emission line\ndata provides a huge dataset for which many interpretations\nare possible. To indicate the complexity of the data, the line\ncomponents along representative transects through the data\nare plotted in Figs. 4 & 5. The plots give the radial velocity\nfor each fitted component as a function of distance along\nthe transect as indicated on the white-light image obtained\nGMOS IFU observations of the stellar and gaseous kinematics in the centre of NGC 1068 5\nby summing over all wavelengths in the datacube. The com-\nponent flux (the product of fitted FWHM and amplitude)\nis represented by the area of the plotted symbol and the\nFWHM is represented by its colour. H\u03b2 absorption is negli-\ngible compared to the emission and has been ignored in the\nfits.\nFig. 4 is for a \u201cdog-leg\u201d transect designed to encompass\nthe major axis of the structure surrounding the brightest\npoint in the continuum map (assumed to be the nucleus)\nand the bright region to the north-east. For comparison,\nFig. 5 shows a transect along an axis roughly perpendicular\nto this. The following general points may be made from this:\n\u2022 Strong shears in radial velocity are present between\nnorth-east and south-west\n\u2022 At each position along the transects there are a number\nof distinct components with different bulk radial velocity,\nspanning a large range (\u223c3000 km\/s)\n\u2022 The majority of the observed flux comes from a com-\nponent spanned by relative radial velocity \u20131000 km\/s to\n0 km\/s\n\u2022 This component, if interpreted as a rotation curve has\na terminal velocity of \u00b1500 km\/s, too large for disk rota-\ntion, so is more likely to indicate a biconical outflow with\na bulk velocity that increases with distance from the nu-\ncleus, reaching an asymptotic absolute value of 500 km\/s.\nThis component also has a large dispersion which is great-\nest close to the nucleus.\n\u2022 The closeness in radial velocity between components\nof modest dispersion within this structure (at transect dis-\ntances between 0 and +1 arcsec) may arise from uncertain-\nties in the decomposition of the line profiles into multiple\ncomponents, i.e. two components of moderate dispersion are\nsimilar to one component with high dispersion,\n\u2022 The other components are likely to indicate rotation\nof gas within disk-like structures, if the implied terminal\nvelocities are small enough, or outflows or inflows.\n\u2022 Any such flows do not appear to be symmetric about\neither the systemic radial velocity or the bulk of the emission\nclose to the nucleus.\nA comparison of the STIS [OIII] emission spectra along\nvarious slit positions (Cecil et al.; Groves et al.) provides\nqualitative agreement with our data in that most of the\ncomponents in our datacube have analogues in their data.\nHowever their data suggest a much more clumpy distribu-\ntion than ours, which is not surprising given the difference\nin spatial resolution. The apparently much greater range of\nradial velocity in their data is because our component maps\nindicate the centroid of the radial velocity of each compo-\nnent, not the full width of the line, which can be considerable\n(FWHM of 1000-2000 km\/s). If we plot the line components\nin the same way as them, the dominant -1000 to 0 km\/s\ncomponent would fill in the range \u20132500 to +1000 in good\nagreement with their data.\nThere is evidence of a bulk biconic flow indicative of a\njet directed in opposite directions from the nucleus plus a\nnumber of flows towards and away from the observer which\ncould be either inflowing or outflowing, but which show a\npreference to be moving away from the observer. Some of\nthese could be associated with disk-like components. As a\nfirst attempt towards interpretation, we seek to identify any\nFigure 7. Two examples of stellar template fits (bold red lines) to\nabsorption lines in the data cube. The top panel shows a spectrum\nfrom a location in the \u2018wedge\u2019 where strong non thermal emission\nsignificantly \u2018eroded\u2019 the absorption lines while the bottom panel\nshows a typical absorption line spectrum. In both panels the con-\ntinuum is fit with a third order polynomial. A 6th order polyno-\nmial in the top panel would fit the continuum wiggles better but\nthe derived kinematics are qualitatively similar to the 3rd order\nfit. The emission line in these panels is the [NI] line (\u03bb\u03bb 5199.8A\u02da).\nThe wavelength between the two dashed lines were excluded in\nthe stellar template fits.\ngaseous components which can be associated with the stellar\nkinematics.\n4 ABSORPTION LINE DATA\n4.1 Stellar Kinematics\nAlthough the GMOS IFU commissioning observations of\nNGC 1068 concentrated on the bright emission lines, the\nMg b absorption line feature (\u223c 5170 A\u02da) is readily identifi-\nable in the spectra over most of the field covered by these\nobservations and can be used to derive the stellar kinemat-\nics. In order to minimize contamination by emission lines\nwhen extracting the stellar kinematics, we only used data in\nthe wavelength range from 5150 to 5400 A\u02da.\nIn order to reliably extract the stellar velocities from\nthe absorption lines it is necessary to increase the signal-\nto-noise ratios by co-adding spectra. The 103 \u00d7 79 individ-\nual spectra in the data cube were co-added using a Voronoi\nbased binning algorithm (Cappellari & Copin 2003). While\nthe improvement in signal\/noise is at the expense of spatial\nresolution, the chosen algorithm is optimised to preserve the\nspatial structure of the target. A signal-to-noise ratio of & 20\nwas used to bin the data, yielding 160 absorption line spec-\ntra above this threshold.\nThe stellar kinematics are extracted from these spec-\ntra using the standard stellar template fitting method. This\nmethod assumes that the observed galaxy spectra can be\n6 J. Gerssen et al.\nFigure 4.

The change of direction marks the zero-point of the distance scale. The area of the circles is\nproportional to the component flux while the colour encodes the line width as indicated in the key.

Maps of the stellar kinematics in the centre of NGC 1068. The reconstructed image (left panel) is obtained by summing\nall spectra in the GMOS IFU datacube from 5100 to 5400 A\u02da. The magnitude scale has an arbitrary offset. The kinematical analysis\npresented in the next two panels uses data that are coadded into spatial bins with a signal-to-noise ratio of 20 or more using a Voronoi\nbinning algorithm (Cappellari & Copin, 2003). The stellar velocity field (centre) and the stellar velocity dispersion (right panel) were\nderived by fitting a stellar template spectrum (type K0III) convolved with a Gaussian distribution to the spectral region around the Mg b\ntriplet (\u223c 5170 A\u02da). The systemic velocity has been subtracted in the central panel. The white contours in this panel show the best-fit\nmodel velocity field, see section 4.3. In all panels North is to the top and East is to the left. Blank regions indicate those areas where\nstrong non-continuum emission prevented satisfactory fits to the absorption line data.\napproximated by the spectrum of a typical star (the stellar\ntemplate) convolved with a Gaussian profile that represents\nthe velocity distribution along the line-of-sight. The Gaus-\nsian parameters that yield the smallest difference in \u03c72 be-\ntween an observed galaxy spectrum and the convolved tem-\nplate spectrum are taken as an estimate of the stellar line-of-\nsight velocity and the line-of-sight stellar velocity dispersion.\nVarious codes have been developed over the past decade that\nimplement stellar template fitting. We have used the pixel\nfitting method of van der Marel (1994) in this paper.\nStellar template spectra were not obtained as part of\nthe NGC 1068 GMOS IFU observations. Instead, we used\na long-slit spectrum of the K0III star HD 55184 that was\nobtained with the KPNO 4m telescope in January 2002 on\na run that measured the stellar kinematics along the ma-\njor and minor axis of NGC 1068 (Shapiro et al. 2003). The\ninstrumental resolution of the KPNO spectrum is the same\nas our GMOS data. Both the template spectrum and the\nGMOS IFU spectra were resampled to the same logarithmic\nwavelength scale before applying the kinematical analysis.\nThe continuum in the galaxy spectra is handled by includ-\ning a 3rd order polynomial in the fitting procedure.\nThe best-fit stellar velocities and stellar velocity disper-\nsions are presented in Fig. 6. A section of the kinematical\nmaps directly North East of the centre is empty. No accept-\nable stellar template fits could be obtained in this region\n(see also Fig. 7). The blank region lies along the direction of\nthe approaching NE jet. Boosted non-continuum emission is\ntherefore the most likely explanation for the observed blan-\nketing of the absorption line features in this area.\n4.2 Comparison and interpretation\nAlthough part of the stellar velocity map is missing, the\noverall appearance is that of a regularly rotating stellar ve-\nlocity field. The kinematical minor axis (with radial veloc-\nity, v = 0) is aligned with the direction of the radio jets\nand with the long axis in the reconstructed GMOS IFU im-\nage. Garcia-Lorenzo et al. (1997) derive the stellar veloc-\nity field over the central 24 \u00d7 20 arcsec in NGC 1068 from\nthe Ca II triplet absorption lines. The part of their velocity\nmap that corresponds to the GMOS IFU data is qualita-\ntively consistent with our velocity map although there ap-\npears to be a rotational offset of about 15 degrees between\nthe two velocity maps. Their best-fit kinematical major axis\nhas PA= 88\u25e6 \u00b1 5\u25e6 while the GMOS IFU maps suggests PA\n\u2243 105\u25e6. The latter is more consistent with the Schinnerer et\nal. (2000) best-fit major axis at PA= 100\u25e6.\nIn Fig. 8 we compare the GMOS data with results we\nderived from the long-slit data obtained along the (photo-\nmetric) major and minor axes of NGC 1068 (Shapiro et\nal. 2003). The long-slit results were obtained from a 3.0\narcsec wide slit. The GMOS kinematics shown in this fig-\nure were therefore derived by mimicking the long-slit ob-\nservations. That is, we extracted the kinematics from 3.0\narcsec wide cuts through the GMOS data along the same\nPAs as the long-slits. The long-slits partially overlap the\nwedge region seen in Fig. 6. However, because of the width\nof the mimicked slits, the contaminating effect of the cen-\ntrally concentrated emission lines was significantly reduced.\nBut some effects on the derived stellar kinematics remain.\n8 J. Gerssen et al.\nFigure 8. A comparison between the results derived from long-\nslit observations of Shapiro et al. (2003, open circles) and stel-\nlar kinematics derived from our GMOS data (filled circles). The\nlong-slit results are obtained with the KPNO 4m telescope along\nthe major axis (PA= 80\u25e6) and the minor axis (PA= 170\u25e6) of\nNGC 1068 (see Fig. 1). The slit width of 3.0 arcsec covers a sub-\nstantial fraction of the GMOS observations. We mimic these long-\nslit observations by deriving the GMOS results in 3.0 arcsec wide\ncuts through the GMOS data. The differences between the two\ndata sets are consistent with the effect of different PSFs.\nMost notably along the minor axis profiles at \u223c 2 arcsec.\n(The Shapiro et al. results were obtained in fairly poor see-\ning conditions resulting in additional smearing.)\nThe stellar velocity dispersion map is missing the same\nregion as the stellar velocity map. Although this includes\nthe nucleus, it appears that the maximum velocity disper-\nsion is located off-centre. The velocity dispersion profiles of\nNGC 1068 published in Shapiro et al. (2003) focused on\nthe behaviour at large radii where contamination by emis-\nsion lines is not an issue. A re-analysis of these data using\na pixel based method rather than a Fourier based method\nshows that the velocity dispersions in NGC 1068 exhibit the\nsame central drop (see also Emsellem et al. 2005) observed\nin the GMOS data. As the spectra of NGC 1068 show very\nstrong emission lines in the central region of this system, the\ndifference with the Shapiro et al. results can be attributed\nto unreliability of Fourier-based methods in the presence of\nsignificant emission lines.\nAssuming that the velocity dispersions are distributed\nsymmetrically around the major axis (PA= 100\u25e6) of the\nkinematical maps, the dispersion distribution resembles the\ndumbbell structures found in the velocity dispersion maps\nof the SABa type galaxy NGC 3623 (de Zeeuw et al. 2002)\nand the SB0 type galaxies NGC 3384 and NGC 4526 (Em-\nsellem et al. 2004). A rotating (i.e. cold) disk embedded in a\nbulge naturally produces the observed dumbbell structure in\nthe velocity dispersions. Both the position angle of the kine-\nmatical major axis and the orientation of the inferred nu-\nclear disk are consistent with the central CO ring (diameter:\n5 arcsec) identified by Schinnerer et al. (2000). Alternative\ninterpretation of the incomplete NGC 1068 stellar dispersion\nmap include a kinematically decoupled core or recent star\nformation (e.g. Emsellem et al. 2001). The GMOS stellar ve-\nlocity maps compliment the larger scale maps of Emsellem\net al. (2005) where the central structure (see their Fig. 6)\nbecomes uncertain for the same reason as for the empty por-\ntion of our data.\n4.3 A stellar disk model\nBoth the gas and stellar data present a very rich and com-\nplex morphology. As a first step toward interpretation we\nfit the GMOS stellar velocity map with a qualitative \u2018toy\u2019\nmodel of a rotating disk. In a forthcoming paper, much more\ndetailed and quantitative models of the gas and stellar data\nwill be presented.\nThe disk model consists of an infinitely thin circular\ndisk (in this simple model we use a constant density profile)\nwith a rotation curve that rises linearly to 75 kms\u22121 out\na radius of 3 arcsec and thereafter remains constant. Both\nthe best-fit amplitude and the break radius as well as the\nposition angle of the disk model were found empirically by\ncomparing the model velocity field to the GMOS velocity\nmap in a least-square sense. We assumed that the disk is\nparallel to the plane of the galaxy (i.e. we assumed an incli-\nnation of i = 30 degrees). The model velocity field is over-\nplotted with white contours in the central panel of Fig. 6.\nThe best-fit position angle of the disk model differs by some\n30\u25e6 (PAdisk = 110\n\u25e6) from the major axis of NGC 1068 but is\nin close agreement with the kinematical position angle (e.g.\nSchinnerer et al. 2000).\nA comparison between the disk model and the H\u03b2 data\nis shown in Fig. 9 at two different projections. The thin\ncontours show the projected intensity distribution of H\u03b2 as\na function of position and velocity. The projected intensity\ndistribution of the disk model is overplotted as thick lines. In\nboth panels the H\u03b2 distribution shows a spatially extended\nstructure that is narrow in velocity space. The overplotted\ndisk model closely matches the location and gradient of this\nstructure in the data cube. To facilitate a comparison by\neye the velocity distribution of the rotating disk model was\nbroadened by 140km s\u22121, the mean observed velocity disper-\nsion, in this figure. The most straightforward interpretation\nof this result is that part of the emission line distribution\noriginates in a rotating gas disk that is aligned with the\nstellar disk in the centre of NGC 1068. This component can,\nwith hindsight, clearly be seen in the transect maps (most\nevident in Fig. 4 near transect position \u22124 arcsec) as the\naligned set of narrow components that are located closely to\nthe systemic velocity of NGC 1068.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nWe have used integral field spectroscopy to study the struc-\nture of the nucleus of NGC1068 at visible wavelengths. We\npresent an atlas of multicomponent fits to the emission\nlines. Interpretation of this large, high-quality dataset is not\nstraightforward, however, since the link between a given fit-\nted line component and a real physical structure cannot be\nmade with confidence.
