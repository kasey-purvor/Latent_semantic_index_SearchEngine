Heredity, 87, (4), 474-479.Gametocidal or `cuckoo' chromosomes have been found in a number of Aegilops species (for a review see Endo, 1990). Cuckoo chromosomes are preferen- tially transmitted when introduced by hybridization into common wheat, Triticum aestivum (2n 6x 42, AABBDD). When present in the sporophyte, gameto- cidal (Gc) factors in the cuckoo chromosomes induce chromosomal breakage in the gametes not containing them, ensuring their own transmission to the progeny (Finch et al., 1984; Nasuda et al., 1998). Plants carry- ing Gc factors in the hemi- or heterozygous form are semi-sterile. However, plants homozygous for Gc fac- tors are fully fertile. Mutations such as deletions and other rearrangements have been detected among the progeny of plants hemi- or heterozygous for the Gc factors. These are thought to arise from gametes that do not carry the Gc gene(s) and su er chromosomal breakage at levels that are not lethal (Endo, 1988a,b, 1990). This phenomenon has been employed to pro- duce sets of deletion stocks in the common wheat cultivar Chinese Spring (CS), using the cuckoo chro- mosome 2C from Ae. cylindrica (Endo&Gill, 1996). The mechanism inducing the chromosomal aberrations is not understood. The cuckoo chromosome 4SL from Ae. sharonensis (2n 2x 14, SLSL) has a very strong gametocidal action in CS and other wheat cultivars (King et al., 1991). Chromosome fragments, usually in the form of pairs of equal length single chromatid segments (SCSs), have been observed during early embryo and endo- sperm development of plants carrying cuckoo chromo- somes (King & Laurie, 1993; de las Heras, 1999). Broken chromosome ends exhibit a tendency to fuse and form dicentric chromosomes (McClintock, 1941; Werner et al., 1992). These dicentrics usually give rise to chromatin bridges at anaphase and may break at telophase, thus perpetuating the break?fusion?bridge (BFB) cycle after fusion of the newly broken chromo- some ends. The mechanism for the Gc-induced chromosomal damage appears to be switched o early during embryo and endosperm development (King & Laurie, 1993; de las Heras, 1999). Root tips from plants carrying the 4SL cuckoo chromosome do not show chromosome fragmentation. However, dicentric chromosomes are sometimes observed, presumably resulting from chro- mosome fragmentation during late gametogenesis and\/ or early embryogenesis. In the work presented here we demonstrate that the DNA hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine (5-AC) induces chromosomefragmentation in the root tips of plants carrying the cuckoo chromo- some 4SL, but not in plants lacking this chromosome.Peer reviewe","downloadUrl":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/64936.pdf","fullTextIdentifier":"http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2160\/3567","pdfHashValue":"9b375f207c7625bf544a1d7c7f528bc5dd98ec99","publisher":null,"rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:cadair.aber.ac.uk:2160\/3567<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2018-01-21T19:38:14Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2160_500<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2160_7908<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2160_1336<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2160_7909<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \n5-azacytidine induces chromosomal breakage in the root tips of wheat carrying the cuckoo chromosome 4S(L) from Aegilops sharonensis<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nde las Heras, Jose I.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nKing, Ian P.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nParker, John S.<\/dc:creator><dc:contributor>\nInstitute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences<\/dc:contributor><dc:subject>\n5-azacytidine<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\nAegilops sharonensis<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\nBFB cycles<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\nchromosome breakage<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\nDNA methylation<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\ngametocidal chromosomes<\/dc:subject><dc:description>\nde las Heras, J.

Gametocidal (Gc) factors carried in 4SL\ninduce chromosome breakage in meiospores not containing them, ensuring their transmission to the\nprogeny. Chromosome breakage and break\u2013fusion\u2013bridge (BFB) cycles can also be observed during\nearly embryo sac development of chromosome 4SL addition lines to wheat, often leading to the\npresence of dicentric chromosomes in the subsequent progeny. However, the process responsible for\ninducing the primary chromosomal breaks only appears to occur during the initial divisions of the\nembryo and endosperm. In the presence of chromosome 4SL, treatment with the hypomethylating\nagent 5-azacytidine induces chromosome breakage in root tips. This suggests that the process of\nchromosome fragmentation, induced by the Gc factors during early seed development, is repressed at\nlater stages by DNA methylation.\nKeywords: 5-azacytidine, Aegilops sharonensis, BFB cycles, chromosome breakage, DNA\nmethylation, gametocidal chromosomes.\nIntroduction\nGametocidal or \u2018cuckoo\u2019 chromosomes have been\nfound in a number of Aegilops species (for a review\nsee Endo, 1990). Cuckoo chromosomes are preferen-\ntially transmitted when introduced by hybridization\ninto common wheat, Triticum aestivum (2n\u0088 6x\u0088 42,\nAABBDD). When present in the sporophyte, gameto-\ncidal (Gc) factors in the cuckoo chromosomes induce\nchromosomal breakage in the gametes not containing\nthem, ensuring their own transmission to the progeny\n(Finch et al., 1984; Nasuda et al., 1998). Plants carry-\ning Gc factors in the hemi- or heterozygous form are\nsemi-sterile. However, plants homozygous for Gc fac-\ntors are fully fertile. Mutations such as deletions and\nother rearrangements have been detected among the\nprogeny of plants hemi- or heterozygous for the Gc\nfactors. These are thought to arise from gametes that\ndo not carry the Gc gene(s) and su\u0080er chromosomal\nbreakage at levels that are not lethal (Endo, 1988a,b,\n1990). This phenomenon has been employed to pro-\nduce sets of deletion stocks in the common wheat\ncultivar Chinese Spring (CS), using the cuckoo chro-\nmosome 2C from Ae. cylindrica (Endo&Gill, 1996). The\nmechanism inducing the chromosomal aberrations is not\nunderstood.\nThe cuckoo chromosome 4SL from Ae. sharonensis\n(2n\u0088 2x\u0088 14, SLSL) has a very strong gametocidal\naction in CS and other wheat cultivars (King et al.,\n1991). Chromosome fragments, usually in the form of\npairs of equal length single chromatid segments (SCSs),\nhave been observed during early embryo and endo-\nsperm development of plants carrying cuckoo chromo-\nsomes (King & Laurie, 1993; de las Heras, 1999).\nBroken chromosome ends exhibit a tendency to fuse\nand form dicentric chromosomes (McClintock, 1941;\nWerner et al., 1992). These dicentrics usually give rise\nto chromatin bridges at anaphase and may break at\ntelophase, thus perpetuating the break\u2013fusion\u2013bridge\n(BFB) cycle after fusion of the newly broken chromo-\nsome ends.\n*Correspondence and present address: Chromosome Biology Section,\nMRC Human Genetics Unit, Crewe Road, Edinburgh EH4 2XU,\nU.K. E-mail: jose@hgu.mrc.ac.uk\nHeredity 87 (2001) 474\u2013479 Received 20 October 2000, accepted 5 June 2001\n\u00d3 2001 The Genetics Society of Great Britain.474\nThe mechanism for the Gc-induced chromosomal\ndamage appears to be switched o\u0080 early during embryo\nand endosperm development (King & Laurie, 1993;\nde las Heras, 1999). Root tips from plants carrying the\n4SL cuckoo chromosome do not show chromosome\nfragmentation. However, dicentric chromosomes are\nsometimes observed, presumably resulting from chro-\nmosome fragmentation during late gametogenesis and\/\nor early embryogenesis. In the work presented here\nwe demonstrate that the DNA hypomethylating agent\n5-azacytidine (5-AC) induces chromosome fragmentation\nin the root tips of plants carrying the cuckoo chromo-\nsome 4SL, but not in plants lacking this chromosome.\nMaterials and methods\nSeeds from common bread wheat Triticum aestivum\n(2n\u0088 6x\u0088 42, AABBDD) var. Chinese Spring (CS), and\nthe monosomic and disomic additions of the chromo-\nsome 4SL to CS (subsequently referred to as 4SLmo and\n4SLdi, respectively), were placed on water-soaked filter\npaper in duplicated Petri dishes at 4\u00b0C for 3 days. After\nprechilling, the filter papers were replaced with fresh\nones. Half of the filter papers in the duplicates were\nsoaked in water, and the other half in a 100-lM\n5-azacytidine (5-AC) solution. The seeds were then\nincubated in the dark at 27\u00b0C for 3 days to induce\ngermination. The filters were renewed every 24 h. After\ngermination, root tips from each dish were collected and\nfixed in a 3:1 ethanol:glacial acetic acid solution for\n24\u201348 h at room temperature, and stored at 4\u00b0C. The\nroot tips were stained with Feulgen reagent after\nhydrolysis with 1 M HCl at 60\u00b0C for 8\u20139 min, squashed\nin 45% acetic acid, and observed under the microscope.\nResults\nObservation of root tip cells at anaphase\/telophase from\nCS wheat, germinated in either water or 5-AC, revealed\nthe presence of only four abnormal divisions out of a\ntotal of 458 cells. These cells each contained a dicentric\nbridge, and chromosome fragmentation was not detec-\nted. The background level of dicentric bridge formation\nin euploid CS when germinated in water was less than\n1% (Table 1). Treatment with 5-AC did not result in a\nsignificant increase of dicentric bridges.\nSimilar results were obtained for Ae. sharonensis,\ndonor of the 4SL cuckoo chromosome (preliminary\nobservations, data not shown).\nThe root tips from plants monosomic or disomic for\nchromosome 4SL germinated in water also contained\ndicentric bridges at a frequency similar to that observed\nin CS (Fisher\u2019s exact test, P\u0088 0.38 and 0.71, respect-\nively). Chromosome fragmentation was not observed. In\ncontrast, treatment of root tips containing chromosome\n4SL with 5-AC resulted in chromosome fragmentation\nas well as dicentric bridges. These abnormalities appear\nidentical to those observed during early embryo and\nendosperm development (King & Laurie, 1993; de las\nHeras, 1999), and pollen development (Finch et al.,\n1984; Nasuda et al., 1998). Although dicentric chromo-\nsomes and bridges were observed, chromosome frag-\nmentation, i.e. cells containing single chromatid\nsegments (SCSs), was by far the predominant form of\naberration. In the monosomic addition, 5-AC treatment\nsignificantly increased the frequency of abnormal ana-\nphases\/telophases from less than 1% to about 9%, and\nin the disomic addition from 1% to about 16%\n(Table 1) (Fisher\u2019s exact test, P \u001c 0.001 in both cases).\nSCSs of various di\u0080erent sizes were observed, usually\nin pairs of equal length, and often associated at one end\n(Figs 1\u20133). Single and double chromatid bridges were\nobserved, which indicates the occurrence of both chro-\nmatid and chromosome type BFB cycles, as described\nby McClintock (1941) and Lukaszewski (1995).\nDiscussion\nCytological effects of 5-AC in wheat root tips\nTreatment with 5-AC resulted in the induction of\nchromosome fragmentation and break\u2013fusion\u2013bridge\n(BFB) cycles in wheat root tips, in the presence of the\ncuckoo chromosome 4SL. Most of the fragments are\npairs of single chromatid segments (SCSs) of equal\nlength, often associated at one end (Figs 1\u20133). This\nsuggests that most of the chromosome breaks occur at\nthe G1 phase, before DNA replication, or perhaps\nduring replication. Similar chromosome fragments can\nbe found during the early embryo and endosperm\ndevelopment in wheat plants carrying chromosome\n4SL (King & Laurie, 1993; de las Heras, 1999). The\nsame type of chromosome breakage \u2014 albeit more\nTable 1 E\u0080ect of 5-AC treatment on wheat: number of\nnormal and abnormal cells (containing chromosome\nfragments and\/or bridges) of 4SLdi and 4SLmo root tips\nobserved at anaphase and telophase\nTotal cells\nobserved Normal Abnormal\nRatio\nabnormal\nCS 232 231 1 <0.01\nCS 5-AC 226 223 3 0.01\n4SLmo 399 398 1 <0.01\n4SLmo 5-AC 118 107 11 0.09\n4SLdi 590 587 3 0.01\n4SLdi 5-AC 268 225 43 0.16\nACTIVATION OF A CUCKOO CHROMOSOME IN WHEAT 475\n\u00d3 The Genetics Society of Great Britain, Heredity, 87, 474\u2013479.\nextensive \u2014 in the gametophyte is responsible for the\npreferential transmission of the cuckoo chromosomes\n(Finch et al., 1984; Nasuda et al., 1998). The fragmen-\ntation reported here in root tips seems likely to be\ninduced by the same mechanism.\nDicentric chromosomes have been observed in\neuploid CS and in the 4SL additions at low frequencies\n(about 1%). However, chromosome fragmentation was\ndetected only after 5-AC treatment when the cuckoo\nchromosome was present. Furthermore, the frequency\nof aberrations (i.e. chromosome fragmentation and\/or\ndicentric chromosomes) was almost double in the root\ntips from the disomic addition (16%), compared to the\nmonosomic (9%) (Table 1). This suggests that the\namount of chromosome breakage in the root tips may\nbe proportional to the number of copies of the Gc\nfactors. This contrasts with the observations of the early\nembryo and endosperm development (King & Laurie,\n1993; de las Heras, 1999). In these tissues, the number of\ncopies of Gc factors does not directly correlate with the\namount of chromosome damage induced by them. The\nfrequency of chromosome aberrations in the embryo sac\nof disomic additions of 4SL is intermediate between the\naberration frequencies of the reciprocally obtained\nmonosomic additions, with paternal transmission of\nthe cuckoo having the strongest e\u0080ect. This could be\nexplained if the Gc factors, or the wheat target sequences\nupon which they act, were subjected to gametic imprint-\ning (see below).\nThe primary e\u0080ect of 5-AC is the nonspecific loss of\nmethylated cytosine residues from the DNA during\nreplication. The ability of 5-AC to induce hypomethy-\nlation and concomitantly reactivate silent genes in\nhigher organisms is well documented (Groudine et al.,\n1981; Jaenisch et al., 1985; Jones, 1985; Klaas et al.,\n1989; Jones et al., 1990; Neves et al., 1995). Methyla-\ntion patterns in cereals appear to change during\ndevelopment, as reported for wheat\/rye hybrids (Neves\net al., 1995; Amado et al., 1997). Thus, if target sites\nFig. 1 A root tip anaphase from 4SLdi wheat, treated with\n5-AC, containing two dissimilar pairs of equal length SCSs\nassociated at one end.

DE LAS HERAS ET AL.\n\u00d3 The Genetics Society of Great Britain, Heredity, 87, 474\u2013479.\nfor the Gc factors became unavailable due to methy-\nlation, this could explain the cessation of chromosome\nfragmentation during early embryo and endosperm\ndevelopment.\nBy generating chromosome fragmentation in root\ntips, using 5-AC in the presence of Gc factors, it should\nbe possible to locate and clone \u2018freshly broken\u2019 chro-\nmosome ends which have not yet fused, using chromo-\nsome microdissection and subsequent amplification of\nthe DNA sequences by degenerate-oligonucleotide-\nprimed PCR (DOP-PCR), as exemplified by Guan et al.\n(1992) in the isolation of DNA from a human chromo-\nsome region frequently deleted in a type of skin cancer.\nThe recognition of target sequences for the Gc system\nmay be of key importance for the understanding of the\nmechanism inducing the chromosome breaks, and they\nmay facilitate the future the development of vectors for\nDNA transfer into wheat.\nTemporal activity of Gc factors\nand DNA methylation\nStudies on the dominance of wheat nucleolar organisers\n(NORs) in wheat\/rye hybrids showed that the rye\nNORs were suppressed by a DNA methylation-depend-\nent mechanism (Neves et al., 1995, 1996). The NOR\nfrom rye chromosome 1R was suppressed early during\nthe seed development in embryo and endosperm,\nremained suppressed in the adult hybrid plant, and\nwas reactivated prior to the first pollen grain mitosis\n(PGM1) during gametogenesis. This pattern interest-\ningly coincides with the pattern of chromosomal\nbreakage induced by the cuckoo chromosome. In\naddition, treatment with 5-AC is able to stably reacti-\nvate rye NORs in root tips and in the embryo sac,\nwhere they are normally inactive (Vieira et al., 1990;\nNeves et al., 1995, 1996). It was concluded that the\nmeiotic reprogramming of the DNA methylation pat-\nterns was responsible for the rye NOR activity during\npollen gametogenesis and in early embryo and endo-\nsperm development. A further change in the methyla-\ntion pattern was found to take place at around day six\npost-fertilization which removed the gametic imprint,\nstably deactivating the rye NOR in both embryo and\nendosperm (Neves et al., 1995). It is almost certain that\nsimilar changes in the methylation patterns take place in\nCS wheat and in the cuckoo addition lines. Similar\nchanges in the methylation patterns have been detected\nin mammals, and are involved with the mechanism\nestablishing and erasing gametic imprinting patterns\n(Tilghman, 1999 and references therein). Gametic\nimprinting has also been reported in angiosperms,\nespecially involving endosperm factors (Kermicle &\nAlleman, 1990; Birchler, 1993).\nGenomic imprinting\nGc factors contain two distinct functions: one induces\nchromosome fragmentation, whereas the other inhibits\nit (Endo, 1990). The phenotypic e\u0080ects (i.e. chromo-\nsome fragmentation and derived aberrations) of the\ninteractions between these two functions and the wheat\ngenome within the embryo sac are probably deter-\nmined not only by their relative dosages, but also by\ntheir parental origin. This suggests that Gc factors are\nsubjected to gametic imprinting, such that the\nfragmentation-inducer function is partially silenced in\nthe maternally derived cuckoo chromosomes, while the\nfragmentation-inhibitor function is silenced in the\npaternally derived cuckoos (de las Heras, 1999). This\nmethylation-based mechanism would result in di\u0080eren-\ntial activity of the Gc factors during early embryo and\nendosperm development in reciprocally obtained\nmonosomic additions, which fits the observations. An\ninteresting implication of this idea (i.e. that Gc factor-\ninduced fragmentation can be activated after hypome-\nthylation) is that 5-AC treatment of meiocytes from a\nnormally fertile 4SL disomic addition should result in\npartial sterility.\nSelective reactivation of genes by 5-AC has been\nfrequently observed (Jones, 1985; Cedar, 1988), while at\nthe same time, demethylation alone is clearly not enough\nto reactivate some genes, which need another secondary\nsignal to be switched on (Doerfler, 1983; Jones, 1985).\nThus, it is possible that in root tips 5-AC treatment may\nonly be able to reactivate the fragmentation-inducer\nfunction of the Gc factors. This could explain the direct\nrelationship between number of cuckoo chromosomes\nand amount of damage induced by them after 5-AC\ntreatment in root tips.\nInterference of epigenetic programmes\nin interspecific hybrids?\nDNA methylation is considered to play a major role in\ngenomic imprinting and developmental gene patterning,\nalthough the actual process is not well understood\n(Bartolomei & Tilghman, 1997). Genomic instability in\nplants and other eukaryotic organisms after treatment\nwith methylase inhibitors has been previously reported.\nIn particular, treatment with 5-AC can disrupt nuclear\norganization and may induce translocations and\nmicronuclei in Triticale (Amado et al., 1997; Castilho\net al., 1999). In addition, it can alter chromatin con-\ndensation and induce abnormal sister chromatid separ-\nation in wheat\/rye hybrids (Glyn et al., 1997). Although\nthese reports do not mention either chromosome frag-\nments of the type induced by cuckoo chromosomes or\nBFB cycles, they may have a common cause. It is\nACTIVATION OF A CUCKOO CHROMOSOME IN WHEAT 477\n\u00d3 The Genetics Society of Great Britain, Heredity, 87, 474\u2013479.\npossible that the introduction of alien chromatin in a\nnew genetic background disrupts the existing \u2018genomic\nprogramme\u2019, and this may be the cause of the observed\ngenomic instability. This disruption could be partic-\nularly sharp if the alien chromatin contained important\nfactors controlling this genomic programming. The\nstrong gametocidal action of 4SL might thus indicate\nthat this chromosome contains factors that are domin-\nant with respect to those of CS wheat. If this is the case,\nthe study of cuckoo chromosomes might reveal import-\nant clues as to how those epigenetic processes work. It\nwould be interesting to compare the e\u0080ects of 5-AC in\nroot tips from other chromosome addition lines, inclu-\nding some non-gametocidal group 4 chromosomes from\nother Aegilops species.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors wish to thank Terry E.
