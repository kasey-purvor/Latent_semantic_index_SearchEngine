Monocytes continuously extravasate from the bloodstream into \ntumors where they differentiate into macrophages and accumulate in hypoxic areas, thereby \nopening up the possibility of using these cells as vehicles to deliver gene therapy to these \notherwise inaccessible sites. We describe a new cell-based method which selectively targets an \noncolytic adenovirus to hypoxic areas of prostate tumors. In this approach, macrophages were \nco-transduced with a hypoxia-regulated E1A\/B construct and an E1A-dependent oncolytic \nadenovirus, whose proliferation is restricted to prostate tumor cells using prostate-specific \npromoter elements from the TARP, PSA and PMSA genes.  When such co-transduced cells \nreach an area of extreme hypoxia, the E1A\/B proteins are expressed, thereby activating \nreplication of the adenovirus. The virus is subsequently released by the host macrophage and \ninfects neighbouring tumor cells. Following systemic injection into mice bearing subcutaneous \nor orthotopic prostate tumors, co-transduced macrophages migrated into hypoxic tumor \nareas, upregulated E1A protein and released multiple copies of adenovirus.   The virus then \ninfected neighboring cells but only proliferated and was cytotoxic in prostate tumor cells, \nresulting in the marked inhibition of tumor growth and reduction of pulmonary metastases.  This \nnovel delivery system employs three levels of tumor specificity; the natural \u2018homing\u2019 of \nmacrophages to hypoxic tumor areas, hypoxia-induced proliferation of the therapeutic \nadenovirus in host macrophages, and targeted replication of oncolytic virus in prostate tumor \ncells. \n \n \n American Association for Cancer Research Copyright \u00a9 2011 \n on February 9, 2011cancerres.aacrjournals.orgDownloaded from \nAuthor manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited.\nAuthor Manuscript Published OnlineFirst on January 13, 2011; DOI:10.1158\/0008-5472.CAN-10-2349\n 3\nIntroduction  \nIn recent years, two crucial components of anti-cancer gene therapies have emerged - the \nneed to both develop effective methods for delivering the \u2018therapeutic\u2019 gene to the tumor site and \nrestrict the expression of genes to the tumor site alone (to avoid extra-tumoral gene expression \nand concomitant side effects).   Transcriptional control, exploiting promoter elements from the \nprostate specific antigen (PSA) gene, have been used to confine therapeutic gene expression to \nprostate epithelial cells (1). The presence of multiple areas of extremely low oxygen tension \n(hypoxia) in tumors, including prostate carcinomas (1), has also been exploited to target \ntherapeutic gene expression.  In this case, the therapeutic gene is placed under the control of \nhypoxia-regulated promoter elements so it is only expressed in hypoxic cells (2-4) . \n An array of viral, synthetic and cell-based vectors have been developed to transport such \ntherapeutic gene constructs from the bloodstream into tumors but most have demonstrated poor \npractical efficacy (5). Only large doses (>1012 particles) of virus injected directly into tumors \nresulted in widespread infection of tumor cells. Intravenous injection is considerably less \nefficient, as most virus fails to penetrate the tumor and ultimately sequestered by the liver (6, 7). \nNew strategies are urgently required to deliver therapeutic genes to sites deep within primary and \nmetastatic tumors. \nRecently, central inflammatory cells: macrophages - and their precursors in the \nbloodstream, monocytes - have attracted considerable attention as gene delivery vehicles as they \nare continually recruited into tumors and migrate into avascular, hypoxic\/necrotic areas (8-10).  \nThere, they up-regulate expression of hypoxia-activated transcription factors (HIFs 1\u03b1 and 2 \u03b1) \nwhich then bind to hypoxic response elements (HRE) within the promoters of multiple tumor-\npromoting and adaptive genes to activate their expression (8, 9).  This prompted us to propose \n American Association for Cancer Research Copyright \u00a9 2011 \n on February 9, 2011cancerres.aacrjournals.orgDownloaded from \nAuthor manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited.\nAuthor Manuscript Published OnlineFirst on January 13, 2011; DOI:10.1158\/0008-5472.CAN-10-2349\n 4\nthat macrophages could be exploited to deliver HIF-regulated therapeutic genes to otherwise \ninaccessible areas in tumors.   Initially, we showed that human macrophages adenovirally-\ninfected with a HIF-regulated reporter or a therapeutic gene and then co-cultured with human \ntumor spheroids in vitro, migrated into the hypoxic centre of these structures and expressed the \nexogenous gene (11). In the current study, we show for the first time that macrophages can be \nengineered to silently transport to, and then produce high titres of therapeutic adenovirus \nspecifically in hypoxic areas of experimental prostate tumors.  An extra level of (prostate) tumor \ntargeting was achieved by placing either the exogenous gene in the virus and\/or the replication of \nthe virus itself under the control of promoter sequences from such prostate-specific genes (12).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n American Association for Cancer Research Copyright \u00a9 2011 \n on February 9, 2011cancerres.aacrjournals.orgDownloaded from \nAuthor manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited.\nAuthor Manuscript Published OnlineFirst on January 13, 2011; DOI:10.1158\/0008-5472.CAN-10-2349\n 5\nMaterial and Methods \nImmunolabelling of hypoxia and macrophages in human prostate tumors \nConsenting patients with localized prostate adenocarcinoma received 0.5gm\/m2 pimonidazole \n(PIMO) i.v. 16-24 h before radical prostatectomy (Mount Vernon Hospital, London).

To determine the distribution of TAM relative to blood vessels, \n30 cases of adenocarcinoma of the prostate were selected at random from the 1997\u20131999 \narchives (Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, UK).

To test this, MDMs were infected with the adenovirus vector CMV-Ad5-\nGFP at increasing MOIs (0-100). The efficiency of infection (i.e. GFP expression with this \nvector) was routinely found to be 75 \u00b1 9.5% (n=5) and reached its peak after 72 h of infection \nwith minimal cytotoxicity compared to uninfected macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 1A& 1B).  \n Co-transduced macrophages, exposed to hypoxia (0.1% O2) for 16h, up-regulated HIF-\n1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1, and (hypoxia regulated) E1A proteins compared to normoxic conditions (Fig. 2B).  \nFurthermore, when supernatants from co-transduced MDMs were titrated in HEK 293 cells, only \nsupernatants from hypoxic MDMs (Fig. 2Ci) resulted in production of detectable infectious \nvirus.

Lung (A549) and prostate (LNCaP) tumor spheroids were \nused to assess the prostate-specificity of the macrophage-based viral delivery system. The inner, \nperi-necrotic regions of both sets of spheroids were confirmed as hypoxic (Fig. 3A). MDMs co-\ntransduced with the HRE-E1A\/B plasmid and a CMV-AdV5-GFP were seen to infiltrate both \nLNCaP and A549 spheroids equally (Fig. 3B). Co-transduced MDMs released sufficient \nadenovirus to cause widespread CMV-driven GFP expression throughout A549 and LNCaP \nspheroids (normoxic and hypoxic areas) within 72h of infiltration (Fig. 3C). \n When MDMs co-transduced with an adenovirus where GFP expression was regulated by \nthe PSA promoter (PSA-AdV5-GFP) and HRE-E1A\/B infiltrated LNCaP and A549 spheroids \nwidespread expression of PSA-driven GFP was only seen LNCaPs (Fig. 3D & E).  \n \nMacrophage delivery of adenovirus to hypoxic areas of human prostate tumors.  \n(i) Delivery of a GFP-expressing adenovirus to prostate tumor xenografts in vivo. \nInitially, we confirmed the relevance of our prostate tumor xenograft models to human prostate \ntumors by showing a similar level of hypoxia in prostate xenografts and primary human prostate \ncarcinomas (Supplementary Fig. 2S).  \n We then co-transduced MDMs with CMV-Ad5-GFP and HRE-E1A\/B and administered \nthese via tail vein injection to mice bearing subcutaneous human prostate (PC3) tumors.

No human CD68+ cells were \ndetected in tumors from mice injected with PBS alone and no GFP was detected in mice injected \nwith untransduced MDMs (data not shown).  In mice receiving singly transduced MDMs, GFP \nexpression was largely restricted to CD68+ human macrophages (Fig. 4A; upper panel). This \ncontrasted with the abundance of GFP+ cells in hypoxic epithelial cells and macrophages in \ntumors treated with co-transduced MDMs (Fig. 4A; lower panel). Therefore, hypoxia present in \nprostate tumor xenografts triggered viral replication within MDMs and viral spread from MDMs \nresulted in the infection of neighbouring tumor cells.  \n In contrast to the hypoxic tumors, the frequency of human MDMs in the liver and \nlung was low (< 1 cell\/field\/view in a total of 10 fields) and no MDMs were detected in the \nkidney or spleen (data not shown). These immunohistochemical data were supported by flow \ncytometry. Similar levels of human MDM infiltration into tumors (2-5%) was seen in all mice \ninjected with MDMs (Fig. 4B).  This equates to approx 442,000 \u00b1 25,000 human MDMs per \nLNCaP xenograft (i.e. 2.21% of the 3 x 106 MDMs injected), as determined using the regression \nequation described by Meyskins et al (1984)(18) [No. of cells\/tumor = 2.40 (tumor diameter)2.378 \n\/ (cell diameter)2.804]. In contrast, mice injected with PBS showed negligible levels of GFP (1.5% \n\u00b1 0.4) - whereas in mice injected with singly transduced MDMs, this increased to 5.6% \u00b1 1.4 of \ncells. However, in tumors from mice injected with co-transduced MDMs GFP expression was \nsignificantly higher (21% \u00b1 5.4 of cells) (Fig. 4B; right panel). These data were reproduced \nwhen mice bearing LNCaP xenografts were injected with macrophages co-transduced with Ad5-\nPSA-GFP and HRE-E1AB.

Systemic delivery of such adenoviruses is limited by liver sequestration, complement, pre-\nimmune IgM and neutralising antibodies (20).  \nThe impact of co-transduction on the phenotype of macrophages was investigated before \ninjection in vivo.  Flow cytometric analysis of co-transduced MDMs revealed no significant \nalteration in the expression of CD11b, CD14, CD68 or classic anti-inflammatory markers such \nas, CD36, MHC-class II and mannose receptor when compared to untreated MDMs or singly \ntransduced MDMs (data not shown). However, an increase in cell surface expression of toll-like \nreceptors (TLRs) 2 and 4 was evident (Supplementary Fig. 3A). TLRs mediate adenoviral \nregulation and transgene expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells following \ninfection, activating their expression of proinflammatory cytokines (21, 22).  This was confirmed \nwhen co-transduced MDMs were found to release elevated levels of various pro-inflammatory \ncytokines (supplementary Fig.3B).   \n \n(b) Effect of MDMs co-transduced with HRE-E1A\/B and Ad[I\/PPT-E1A] on tumor spheroids. \n American Association for Cancer Research Copyright \u00a9 2011 \n on February 9, 2011cancerres.aacrjournals.orgDownloaded from \nAuthor manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited.\nAuthor Manuscript Published OnlineFirst on January 13, 2011; DOI:10.1158\/0008-5472.CAN-10-2349\n 15\nInfiltration of LNCaP spheroids by co-transduced MDMs triggered sufficient adenoviral \nproduction to cause widespread cell death after 48h (Fig. 5A & B). The ability of hypoxic, co-\ntransduced MDMs to kill monolayers of LNCaPs was confirmed using the MTS assay (Fig. 5C).  \nNo cell death was evident for monolayers of A549 cells infected in parallel MTS assays (data not \nshown).  \nAs macrophages in tumors can be pro-angiogenic (9), we investigated whether this might \nbe the case with our co-transduced MDMs, by taking media conditioned by LNCaP spheroids \nalone or following infiltration by co-transduced MDMs and adding this to human umbilical vein \nendothelial cells (HUVECs). Co-transduced MDMs failed to induce tubule formation \n(Supplementary Fig. 4A & B). Interestingly, the presence of co-transduced MDMs significantly \n(p = 0.035) reduced rather than increased the release of the pro-angiogenic cytokine, VEGF, by \nLNCaP spheroids.  It also increased release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-\n6 and IL-8  (Supplementary Fig. 4C) while leaving IL-10, IL-12p70 or GMCSF levels in the \nmedia unaffected (data not shown).  \n \n(c) Effect of MDMs co-transduced with HRE-E1A\/B and Ad[I\/PPT-E1A] on subcutaneous and \northotopic LNCaP xenografts in vivo. \nMice bearing subcutaneous LNCaP xenografts were injected with 100ul PBS containing either 3 \nx 106 singly-transduced MDMs, co-transduced MDMs or 5 x 1010 Ad[I\/PPT-E1A]  particles. As \nearly as day 5 after treatment initiation, a single injection of co-transduced MDMs resulted in \n50% reduction in tumor size, and by day 15, 2 mice were tumor-free.

Inhibition of tumor growth between these two groups was significant (p= \n0.001). By contrast, mice that received PBS or singly-transduced MDMs had to be killed early \ndue to large tumors. To confirm that tumor regression correlated with the cytolytic ability of \nAd[I\/PPT-E1A], immunohistochemistry with an anti-E1A antibody detected E1A protein \nexpression in the tumors of mice receiving both co-transduced MDMs and Ad[I\/PPT-E1A] but \nnot in tumors treated with PBS or singly-transduced MDMs (data not shown).  E1A expression \nwas also only detected in the livers of mice directly injected with Ad[I\/PPT-E1A] alone (data not \nshown). \n Survival data are summarized in Fig. 6A (right panel). Tumor-bearing mice that received \nco-transduced MDMs survived longer than the other treatment groups. Fig. 6B shows \nrepresentative images of tumors from each group of mice. Tumors from mice receiving co-\ntransduced MDMs were necrotic and contained few viable cells (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, the \ntumors from mice treated with Ad[I\/PPT-E1A] or co-transduced MDM were considerably paler \nand less vascularised (Fig. 6B). In the case of Ad[I\/PPT-E1A] injected mice, this could have \nresulted from the reduction in blood vessels on the under surface of tumor and\/or the marked \nleukocyte infiltration that reportedly occurs with oncolytic adenoviruses (20). Indeed, tumors in \nthe Ad[I\/PPT-E1A] injected group had significantly more murine F480+ cells (64\u00b113%) \ncompared to the other groups (Fig. 6B). By contrast, mice receiving co-transduced MDMs had \nlow F4\/80+ cell infiltration - most likely because these tumors were very small and mainly \nnecrotic\/acellular. This implies that the anti-angiogenic effect of co-transduced MDMs seen in \nvitro also occurred in LNCaP tumors in vivo.  \nTumor growth in mice bearing orthotopic LNCaPs was significantly inhibited when mice were \n American Association for Cancer Research Copyright \u00a9 2011 \n on February 9, 2011cancerres.aacrjournals.orgDownloaded from \nAuthor manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited.\nAuthor Manuscript Published OnlineFirst on January 13, 2011; DOI:10.1158\/0008-5472.CAN-10-2349\n 17\ninjected with Ad[I\/PPT-E1A] alone or co-transduced macrophages (Fig. 6C), the latter having a \nmore marked effect. Significantly more F480+ TAMs (71%\u00b117) were detected in mice injected \nwith Ad[I\/PPT-E1A] than those injected with PBS alone, singly-transduced MDMs or co-\ntransduced MDMs (data not shown).  In both tumor models considerably more necrosis was \ndetected in tumors from mice injected with co-transduced MDMs (Fig. 7A&B). Notably, \nalthough lung metastases were visible in mice in control groups (Fig. 7A,B ii, iii), these were \nabsent in the mice treated with co-transduced MDMs.  \n \n(iii) Macrophages protect Adenovirus from adenoviral neutralizing antibodies in human sera  \nIn humans, pre-existing humoral immunity to adenovirus can interfere with the systemic delivery \nof adenovirally-based therapies. We hypothesised that our macrophage delivery system would \nprotect adenoviruses against these pre-existing anti-adenoviral neutralising antibodies (NAb). \nIndeed, the presence of high titer NAb in cultures of co-transduced MDMs (CMV-AdV5-GFP \nand HRE-E1A\/B) did not prevent E1A complementation and replication under artificially \ninduced hypoxic conditions (data not shown) or in hypoxic tumor spheroids as seen by the \nwidespread expression of GFP (Supplementary Fig.5A- upper panel). By contrast, the same \nconcentration of NAb significantly neutralized the transduction of tumor spheroids by \nadenovirus (CMV-AdV5-GFP) alone (Supplementary Fig. 5A; upper panel). Delivery of \noncolytic Ad[I\/PPT-E1A] by co-transduced MDM was also not effected by NAb and replication \nof the oncolytic virus resulted in reduced spheroid size comparable to that of untreated co-\ntransduced MDMs (no NAb) (Supplementary Fig. 5A; lower panel). Prior to injecting co-\ntransduced MDM or adenovirus alone, tumor-bearing mice were passively immunized with this \nhigh titer NAb and the presence of circulating NAb was confirmed 3h post injection \n American Association for Cancer Research Copyright \u00a9 2011 \n on February 9, 2011cancerres.aacrjournals.orgDownloaded from \nAuthor manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited.\nAuthor Manuscript Published OnlineFirst on January 13, 2011; DOI:10.1158\/0008-5472.CAN-10-2349\n 18\n(Supplementary Fig. 5b).

Moreover, this approach fails to \ntarget metastatic tumors growing at distant sites (23-26). \nOur finding that macrophages accumulate in hypoxic areas of human prostate tumors and \nhuman prostate tumor xenografts prompted us to develop a means of using these cells to deliver \ntherapeutic adenovirus to these sites - and via a systemic route permitting the targeting of \nprimary tumors and their metastases.  Since hypoxia also exists in diseased tissues other than \ntumors (27) and mild hypoxia can exist in healthy tissues (28), we added a further degree of \ntumor targeting by placing the exogenous gene (eg. GFP) in the virus - or the further replication \nof the virus itself when released by macrophages - under the control of prostate-specific \npromoters.  \n We found hypoxia-induced replication and release of adenovirus by infiltrating co-\ntransduced macrophages resulted in the widespread infection of tumor cells and expression of the \nPSA-driven GFP reporter gene construct in the adenovirus.  Interestingly, infiltration of tumor \nspheroids or tumor xenografts with relatively small numbers of co-transduced human \nmacrophages resulted in widespread dissemination of the virus (due to the amplification and \nrelease of thousands of viral copies by each hypoxic macrophage).  \nWe then used macrophages to systemically deliver an oncolytic adenovirus (Ad[I\/PPT-\nE1A]).  This virus previously demonstrated therapeutic potential but only when injected directly \ninto prostate tumors (16, 19). Studies using different oncolytic viruses in various tumor models \nhave shown a heterogeneous and incomplete dissemination of virus (29-31) since adenoviruses \n American Association for Cancer Research Copyright \u00a9 2011 \n on February 9, 2011cancerres.aacrjournals.orgDownloaded from \nAuthor manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited.\nAuthor Manuscript Published OnlineFirst on January 13, 2011; DOI:10.1158\/0008-5472.CAN-10-2349\n 20\ninteract with human blood cells following systemic delivery.  This could be responsible for \nreducing the therapeutic effect (32). The compromised vascular supply within necrotic areas, the \ndistorted functional properties of tumor vessels, and the elevated tumor interstitial fluid pressure \nalso contribute to an unequal viral distribution within tumors (30).  \nMice bearing both subcutaneous and orthotopic tumors exhibited remarkable tumor \nregression following a single injection of co-transduced MDMs and showed no signs of \nregrowth. Viral delivery by macrophages therefore resulted in a lasting anti-tumor effect with \nnegligible metastatic frequency.  Moreover, we required at least 1000-fold fewer adenoviral \nparticles in this system, compared to animals administered with virus alone. We have therefore \nexceeded previous benchmarks by greatly reducing the amount of virus tumor-bearing mice \nreceive, circumventing the need for systemic intratumoral administration. We are aware \nhowever, that our in vivo studies were carried out in immunocompromised mice.  This choice of \nanimal model was because human Ad replication is known to be negligible in rodent cells so \nsyngeneic murine tumor models could not be used (33, 34). Although host immunity against \nsuch co-transduced, \u2018therapeutic\u2019 autologous macrophages may be activated in a fully \nimmunocompetent host, the fact that the adenovirus is in a latent phase during trafficking of \nmacrophages to hypoxic tumor sites, suggests that expression of viral antigens is likely to be \nextremely low. The oncolytic adenovirus used in this study has been tested extensively against \nnumerous human tissues as part of a clinical assessment of its safety in possible clinical trials. \nEven at high multiplicities of infection this virus showed no ability to replicate in primary cells \nfrom such healthy human tissues as endothelium, urothelium, lungs, liver etc (Maitland NJ and \nco-workers unpublished observations). Moreover, neutralizing antibodies from human sera \nadministered to human prostate tumor-bearing mice, had no impact on the activity of this \n American Association for Cancer Research Copyright \u00a9 2011 \n on February 9, 2011cancerres.aacrjournals.orgDownloaded from \nAuthor manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited.\nAuthor Manuscript Published OnlineFirst on January 13, 2011; DOI:10.1158\/0008-5472.CAN-10-2349\n 21\noncolytic virus when delivered systemically via our macrophage system suggesting that patients \nwith preexisting adenovirus immunity would be suitable candidates for i.v. administration of \nsuch viruses (35). The application of a cell-mediated viral delivery system like the one described \nin this study may also prevent adenovirus neutralization from taking place by offering protection \nto the virus from humoral immunity (36, 37).   \nIn summary, we describe a novel system whereby the natural ability of macrophages to \nharbor and support viral replication was used as \u2018silent carriers\u2019 to trigger oncolytic viral \nproduction in hypoxic areas of tumors, resulting in intratumoral spread and a lasting therapeutic \neffect.   \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe are grateful to the Yorkshire Cancer Research and the Prostate Cancer Charity for their \nsupport of different parts of this study.
