This paper presents a case study approach for the development of a cost model \nmethodology that can be used to estimate the costs of a new technology-intensive product. \nThe cost drivers involved in estimating the cost of these products are identified together with \nthe need for expert judgement in the estimating process.  \n \nThe paper is structured in eleven sections. The next section identifies relevant research in \ncost estimating and presents current practices within automotive and non-automotive sectors, \nespecially focusing on new technology cost estimating processes. It is important to \nunderstand the nature of new technology therefore section 3 defines new technology and \nrelates the definition to the automotive sector. The following section presents an overview of \nthe methodology developed for the cost estimating. The methodology has three major steps: \nidentification of new and \u2018carry-over\u2019 technologies, cost estimating both the parts and finally \nadjusting cost models due to the difference in sources of data used. The methodology is \ndeveloped using a case study approach on powertrain cost estimating. Once the \u2018carry-over\u2019 \ntechnology intensive parts are identified, the cost is estimated based on historical data \n(section 5). Estimating the cost of the parts that are new technology based is trickier; it \nrequires a comparative study with previous knowledge within other sectors (section 6). The \nmodel developed as a result of the case study is fine adjusted to reflect the difference in time \nframe of the source data in section 7. The methodology is then validated using two case \n 3\n                                                                                                                                            \nstudies, discussed in section 8 and 9. Discussion on the research methodology and results \nobtained are presented in section 10, and finally the paper concludes in section 11 and \nproposes future improvements to the cost models. \n \n2 Related Research and Current Practice \nActivity-based costing, theory of constraints, feature based costing, parametric costing and \nanalogy are typical cost estimating and control techniques designed to provide more relevant \ninformation for evaluating the economic consequences of resource allocation decisions[1-5]. \nAlmost all literature on estimating future costs or technology [6-8] has been applied to large civil \nengineering projects or low volume aerospace projects, since these industries often rely on \npreviously-developed estimates to win new contracts. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the \nUnited States has developed a parametric costing model for future space projects that is \nbased on very little historical data[6]. It was argued that using historical data and relationships \nfailed to produce accurate estimates on which to base budgets[7]. The research presented in \nthis paper suggests that unique cost drivers mean that each project needs to be estimated on \nits own merits. Several iterations of estimates also need to be conducted, each one in greater \ndepth than the previous one. Cost control needs to use these estimates as the basis for \ndecisions once the budget has been set. Moreover, management support during cost control \nallows accurate budgets to be achieved. However, a major problem involves the level of \nresources required to compile each stage of estimates during the conceptual phases and the \nfollowing reconciliation between them.  \n \nIn order to capture current practice within the automotive sector, a series of semi-structured \ninterviews and telephone interviews  were organised with cost estimators with three different \ncompanies, one of them is the industry leader in cost estimating practices.  It is observed, in \nthe automotive sector different processes and procedures have been developed to help an \nactivity achieve its commercial goal. For example, the Product Development System in one of \nthe participating automotive companies determines how much a product can be sold for and \nthen works back into system chunks and then into component level - although it fails to \nprovide a costing function. The company uses activity based techniques for estimating costs \n 4\n                                                                                                                                            \nwhen the target and supplier quotes are disconnected. All information is stored in a database \nand so every cost driver can be traced to its original figure, which is based on real world data. \nCost drivers can be defined as the portions of a system, end item, or service that have a large \nor major effect on the total work activity or output[8, 9, 10]. But the current practice does not \nsupport cost estimation of New Technology intensive automotive products in a structured \nmanner. Currently it is practiced in an ad hoc fashion. The next stage was to look at non-\nautomotive companies to understand their current practice. \n \nData for this part of the research was obtained from responses to a semi-structured \nquestionnaire sent to twelve companies based in different industry sectors, including space, \naerospace, oil, electronics and motor sports. The responses indicated that the application of \nnew technology, whether new to the industry or to the company, was too insignificant to \ndevelop specialised costing routines. However, certain industries, such as space, regularly \nutilise new technology, and so have dedicated resources to costing future products, typically \nusing the parametric approach[11]. A consultancy company also developed cost estimates for \nnew or future technology; rather than focusing on a specific costing procedure, the company \nrelied on the information available at the time of the study to determine the cost estimating \nroutine. It is also important to consider that new technology solutions does not always contain \nall new ideas. For example, although Formula One motor racing cars are on the cutting edge \nof car dynamics, less than 15% of a development budget is assigned to new technologies \n \n3 Classification of New Technology \nAutomotive companies have well-established procedures that dictate the methods of \ndeveloping advanced technology and detail the milestones to be achieved. The most \nimportant of these for this research are referred to as \u2018concept readiness\u2019 and \u2018implementation \nreadiness\u2019. These analyse the concept, indicate that the technology fundamentally works, and \nverify that it can be manufactured, whilst meeting targeted deliverables with confidence levels \nestimated and risks defined. This research will target the post implementation stage of the \nconcept design. The study focused on existing practice and documentation available within \nthe automotive sector. It is observed that new technologies in general can be divided into \n 5\n                                                                                                                                            \nthree major categories: New to Mankind, New to Industry and New to an Organisation (Figure \n1).  The automotive industry often follow technology development [9], therefore very unlikely \nto adopt \u2018New to Mankind\u2019 type of technology. New technologies from other industries are \noften considered as mature enough and less \u2018risky\u2019 for automotive sector. It is also observed \nthat within a part\/system of a car existing and new technologies are often mixed. Therefore, \nwhile developing a methodology for cost estimating new technology intensive products, the \nproduct could be analysed for: \n                                  \nFigure 1: Types of new technologies \n \nNew   New content type for the company \nNew like  New with similar attributes to a specified design \nModified  Redesigned from an existing stated design \nCarry over   Is exactly the same as an existing stated design \n \nOnce the concept is broken down into new technology and current or carry over technology, \nthe respective systems can be entered into the correct cost model. The next section presents \nthe methodology for \u2018New Technology Cost Model\u2019 development and follow a case study \napproach. \n \n4 Cost Model Development Methodology \nA case study based approach is followed to analyse the cost model development in detail. \nThe cost model considers new products using either current technology and and\/or new \n 6\n                                                                                                                                            \ntechnology, and so needs to distinguish between the two areas. Figure 2 shows the flow and \nlinks between the different core areas of the model and the two distinct sub models for new or \ncurrent technology. The model must accept the required data from the user and automatically \ngenerate a results sheet without further data manipulation. Both current and new technology \ncost estimating methods are required because the key deliverable for this research is to \ndevelop a process to cost new technology intensive products, inferring that there is some \ncarry over of current technology. The case study is based on the Powertrain System. \n                                      \nFigure 2: Model user interfaces flow \nThe process must be able to cost the current and new technology in a generic fashion and be \napplicable to more than one product type within the powertrain. Figure 3 shows how the \nmodel processes will flow; the concept for the new and carry over technology models is also \nshown. The process starts with the cost estimator receiving a request to examine a concept; \nthe first task for the estimator is to segregate the new technology from the carry over \ntechnology.  \n 7\n                                                                                                                                            \n \nFigure 3: A conceptual process flow for the New Technology Cost Model. \nThe methodology includes use of historical data where relevant and expert judgement [12] to \nperform the comparative study when necessary. The first task is to separate the carry-\nover\/current technology requirement from new technology requirement. This is a knowledge \nintensive task and requires domain expert participation. The cost of current technology \nintensive parts are then estimated based on cost estimating relationships (CERs) developed \nfrom historical data. Depending on the nature of the data stored previously, there may be a \nneed to remove any double counting of cost due to the introduction of the new technologies. \nThe new technology part is more complex. It depends on identifying a \u2018comparator\u2019 for the \ntechnology from other parts of the company or from non-automotive sectors. If a CER exists, \nthat can be used with appropriate adjustments to reflect the differences with automotive \nsector. Otherwise, the cost has to estimated from an indication of cost of the \u2018comparator\u2018 \nthrough expert judgement. The methodology developed through this case study is then \nvalidated with two further case studies in section 9.  \n \n5 Current technology cost models \nDeveloping the total cost of the powertrain required a database of previous engine data. \nSince previous powertrains have been in the form of engines, the model is only able to \nestimate engines utilising current technology. The model will only cost high volume \n 8\n                                                                                                                                            \nautomotive powertrain products. Historical data was available from previous engines for the \ncarry over technology model, although all possible cost drivers needed to be identified and \ntested for their relationship to cost to ensure that the correct data was collected. The potential \ncost drivers available in the concept stages of the design process included percentage of new \ntechnology, weight, size, fuel type, vehicle platform, size restrictions, efficiency of the system, \nproduct innovation, complexity, packaging and power output. Once the relevant attributes \nwere identified, engine data was entered into a database and cost relationships established.  \n \nEighteen current engines were broken down by their unique system code with the \ncorresponding cost attached.

Figures from the UK Office of National Statistics \nmonthly Producer Price Index were used against the cost of each engine and multiplied by a \nfactor to obtain the same reference time frame.

Figure 7 is an example of the system identification process with \nnew technologies indicated. This classification means that new technologies can be costed \nwithin the new technology cost estimating relationships (CERs). The identification also feeds \none of the CER drivers for the current technology. Any costs present in both the current and \nnew technology models will be identified so that they can be removed from the current model. \nNew tech\n1 2 3\n03 00 00 ENGINE SYSTEM\n03 01 00 Basic Engine Structure Subsystem\n03 01 01 Cylinder Block Y\n03 01 02 Cylinder Heads\n03 01 03 Intake Manifold\n03 01 04 Exhaust Manifold\n03 01 05 Flywheel Housing\/Adaptor\n03 01 06 Engine Lifting Eyes\n03 02 00 Engine Lubrication Subsystem\n03 02 01 Oil Pump and Screen Y\n03 02 02 Oil Filter, Dip Stick and Filler\n03 02 03 Oil Pan and Reservoirs\n03 02 04 Engine Oil Cooler Y\n03 02 05 Oil Distribution\n03 02 06 Engine Lubricant\n03 03 00 Engine Cooling Subsystem\nLevel\nCode Description\n \nFigure 7: New technology identification interface \n \nThe new technology cost model must be able to accommodate all new technologies. \nHowever, since each technology has a different set of cost drivers, a different model would be \nrequired for each one. To facilitate this, and to allow for future developments, the new \ntechnologies suite has been divided into a main general information screen and a specific \ncost model for the technologies. If the cost model fails to reflect the technology in question, \nthere is a generic model that accommodates all other technologies. \n \n 11\n                                                                                                                                            \nOnce the new technology content for the powertrain has been identified, it can be processed \nthrough the new technology cost model. The first stage of this process is to group the \nidentified technologies into a maximum of five overall systems. For technologies that have \nbeen identified and a relationship mapped, there will be a specific user interface, and these \nmodels are termed \u2018identified new technology relationships\u2019. The estimate process follows the \nright hand side of Figure 8 if a cost model is available for a particular technology. Once the \nappropriate new technology interface is located, the user enters the data required from a \ncomparator that has been identified as similar to the product under investigation. The generic \nmodelling process is used if the new technology being investigated does not have a specific \nCER within an interface. This is called the non-identified new technology model and the \nprocess follows the left-hand side path of Figure 8, starting with the user entering a number \nthat represents either the cost or the price of a comparator system. \n \nFigure 8: New technology model process routes \nDifferences exist between cost and price, which should be reflected in the data accompanying \nthe estimate. If the comparator is estimated, the methodology behind estimating a comparator \ninstead of the actual system is that the comparator is already available and manufacturing \nmethods and materials can be identified, and a detailed estimate compiled. Together with the \nfinancial data of the system, the comparator would use the comparator system definition and \nthe new system definition to produce the concept cost model. Fuel Cell [13] is identified as the \ncomparator system for the case study. The nature of the cost model meant that some details \ndescribing the fuel cell system were required as inputs. However, since there are as yet no \navailable high volume production costs for fuel cells, an existing detailed costing exercise \nfocusing on fuel cells was utilised. The study was performed by Directed Technologies Inc. for \n 12\n                                                                                                                                            \nFord under contract to the United States Department of Energy Office of Transportation \nTechnologies  (contract no. DE-AC02-94CE50389)[13]. A cost model was developed with the \nequation published that applies to a system production of 300,000 units per annum. \n                                      \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b +++=\nP\nLPC\nD\nP\nNHV\nx2734.5\n27.31073  \nWhere; CHV  = high volume cost of fuel cell system (USD) \n PN = net fuel cell peak power output (kW) \n LP = total cell platinum catalyst loading (mg\/cm2) \n PD = cell peak power density (W\/cm2) \n \nThese drivers were incorporated into an interface similar to the combustion engine model and \nthe other new technology data entry screens. Similar to the generic new technology interface, \nthe fuel cell interface utilises a comparator and cost walk system. \nEngine cost\ny = 0.008x6 - 0.6111x5 + 18.537x4 - 285.54x3 + 2339.2x2 - 9615.9x + 18237\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n50 10\n0\n20\n0\n30\n0\n40\n0\n50\n0\n60\n0\n70\n0\n80\n0\n90\n0\n1,0\n00\n1,1\n00\n1,2\n00\n1,3\n00\n1,4\n00\n1,5\n00\n1,6\n00\n1,7\n00\n1,8\n00\n1,9\n00\n2,0\n00\n(t\nho\nu)\nVolume ( thou)\nC\nos\nt\nTotal c ost\nfixed cost\nvariable cost\nPoly. (Tota l cost)\n \nFigure 9: Cost versus volume relationship \nAs with any cost estimate, a production volume was assumed, enabling manufacturing \nmethods to be attributed to the design. Since this cost model must be able to accommodate \nmore than one volume scenario, Ford manufacturing plants were analysed to determine the \neffect of volume on the total cost; Figure 9 shows the results. Confidentiality prevents the \nactual costs represented on the y-axis from being disclosed, but the relationships depicted \nare correct and show that fixed costs are static no matter what volume is produced. Variable \ncosts had the largest volume influence on the total engine cost; they decrease significantly \nwith volume, until the manufacturing line is at maximum output. Volume cost temporarily \n 13\n                                                                                                                                            \nincreases because the costs of a new line have to be recouped. The research by Directed \nTechnologies assumed that 300,000 products per annum would be produced. The research \npresented in this paper assumed 300,000 to be half the maximum volume of the \nmanufacturing line, since the new technology is in the early stages of mass production and so \nnot at full production volumes. From this, the relationship in Figure 9 is applied to the results \nfrom the fuel cell estimating equation to adjust the comparator cost depending on the volume. \n \nOnce the cost of the comparator product has been established, the estimate has to be at \nvariance to the new concept under investigation using the comparator to concept technology \nprocess. Stating a small number of high-level characteristics and asking the user to scale the \ncost movements within a predefined scope calculate this migration. The first step of this \nprocess is to identify the areas of largest influence within the systems, which was achieved \nthrough responses provided by five estimators to a semi-structured questionnaire. The \nconcept of systems was emphasised, since they contain multiple primary manufacturing \nprocesses rather than commodities, which are usually grouped by the primary manufacturing \nprocess, such as plastic injection moulding. Attempting to identify the key drivers for systems \nthat were not specifically one manufacturing process gave a wide range of results (Figure 10). \nCost element %* Cost element %*\nComplexity 4.0 Patent technology 1.8\nComponent design 1.4 Plant location regionally 0.6\nCount of materials involved 2.2 Plant untilisation 3.8\nCustomer application 2.4 Sales volume 4.4\nDesign tolerances 3.4 Single or multiple sourced 0.4\nLabour intensity 2.6 Size 2.8\nManufacturing process 22.6 System design 4.8\nMaterial 28.0 System innovation 5.0\nNumber of parts in the design 3.6 System integration 1.0\nPackage requirements 2.2 Weight 3.0\n*% is average across all results  \nFigure 10: Product elements with cost influence \nThe top six cost influencing elements were materials, innovation, manufacturing process, \nmanufacturing volume, component design, and complexity.

Following \nidentification of the key elements for systems cost drivers, the comparator product could be \nfinancially walked to the new system under investigation. A basic model was built that \nenabled the user to compare the estimated\/priced system with the one under analysis using \nthe four areas of movement identified in Figure 11. The model variance used a range of \nnumbers from negative three to positive three centring on zero to dictate movement in a \nparticular area. A model and process was then built utilising these drivers as described in the \nnumbered points below and in Figure 12. \nComparator system cost (US $)\nElement Weight Attribute\nMaterial 3\nProcess 2\nInnovation -2\nDesign 0\nTotal\nNew tech system cost (US $)\nThe % is multiplied by \nthe comparator cost to \ngive an element cost. \nThe figure is then \ntotalled to give an \nabsolute movement\nThe comparator cost or price is entered into the model\n14.29\n14.29\n45.71\n17.14%\n8.57%\n-2.86%\n0.00%\nThe total attribute cost movement is \nthen multiplied by the cost element \nweighting\nThe result of the three items \nis a total cost movement, in \n%, from the original \ncomparator system cost\nComparing the comparator to \nthe new system in terms of \ncost influence each driver is \ngiven a rating ranging from -3 \nto +3\nEach attribute in the \nrange has a value \nand the value is \nmultiplied by the \nattribute assigned by \nthe user.\n34.29\n17.14\n-5.71\n0.00\n200\nCost diff \n%\n40%\ncost per \natt\n14.29\n30% 14.29\n10%\nCost influence \n(US $)\n245.71\n20%\n2\n5\n3 6\n4\n1\n \nFigure 12: Comparator cost walk \n1.

The magnitude of the figure indicates the size \nof the cost difference.  \n3. Each movement increment is given a value. The model has a maximum of 50% \nmovement from the zero baselines to the maximum movement of plus or minus three, \nthus assigning each increment 14.29 percentage points. \n4.  The total movement stated within step [2] is multiplied by the increment value identified in \nstep [3]. The result is a total movement within the system cost for each element. \n5. To give a figure that represents the percentage movement as a total of the elements, the \nfigure resulting from [4] is multiplied by the elemental weighting given in each element \nand displayed as a percentage.  \n6. The percentage is calculated as a numerical figure of the comparator cost stated in step \n[1]. These are then totalled and added to the comparator cost to give a new system cost. \n \nFigure 13 is an example of the results the user sees for each technology under investigation. \nElement costs are shown on the left, totals on the right. The first total is the original \ncomparator, then the cost walk to the new system and finally the total new cost for the new \nsystem under investigation. \nNew technology cost effect System costs USD\nMaterial Comparator system cost\nProcess New technology\nInnovation\nDesign Total system cost\n2184\n1965\n-218\n-31.16\n62.32\n-249.27\n0.00\n \nFigure 13: Comparator cost walk results layout \n \n7 Cost estimate adjustments model \nThe estimates for each new technology and current technology content were collated into a \nsingle cost estimate applicable for a product launch timeframe. This collation and timeframe \ncreates two issues that were addressed within the \"Year of implementation economics \nadjustment\" and \"Current technology cost adjustment\" models. The first issue is that the \nprogramme estimates all the areas of technologies within the product at current conditions, \nand so the product would have to be launched within the year of analysis to have any \nrelevance to the estimate. This was unacceptable, since the model must be able to cost \n 16\n                                                                                                                                            \nproducts that are due to be launched in five or ten years\u2019 time. One method to forecast future \neconomics was to examine past trends in the form of the Producer Price Index.  \n \nThe data begins in 1974, with a gradual increase in the index to the present day, with 1995 \nused as the zero base. However, there is a slight decline in the gradient over time and a \nprojection from this basis could result in a misrepresentation of the data. Therefore, a second \nchart was produced utilising the data from 1995 onwards and projecting the trend forwards to \n2005 using the least squares method; see Figure 14. If the need arises for data to project \nforward by ten years, then the use of the full dataset would be recommended with the overall \ndecline in gradient taken into consideration. From the trend line formula, a routine was \ndeveloped that takes both the current technology cost and the new technology cost and \nmultiplies them by the factor identified in the formula. \n \nThe model in this state creates a \u2018double count\u2019 of some costs that must be eliminated. The \ncurrent technology suite estimates an absolute cost for a complete engine, whilst the new \ntechnology models generate absolute costs for each new technology system. Therefore, the \nidentified new technology systems must be removed from the current technology cost. \nPPI 1995 to 2005 \ny = 0.1167x + 99.712\nR2 = 0.9318\n95.0\n97.0\n99.0\n101.0\n103.0\n105.0\n107.0\n109.0\n111.0\n113.0\n115.0\n19\n95\n 01\n19\n95\n 05\n19\n95\n 09\n19\n96\n 01\n19\n96\n 05\n19\n96\n 09\n19\n97\n 01\n19\n97\n 05\n19\n97\n 09\n19\n98\n 01\n19\n98\n 05\n19\n98\n 09\n19\n99\n 01\n19\n99\n 05\n19\n99\n 09\n20\n00\n 01\n20\n00\n 05\n20\n00\n 09\n20\n01\n 01\n20\n01\n 05\n20\n01\n 09\n20\n02\n 01\n20\n02\n 05\n20\n02\n 09\n20\n03\n 01\n20\n03\n 05\n20\n03\n 09\n20\n04\n 01\n20\n04\n 05\n20\n04\n 09\n20\n05\n 01\nMonths\nIn\nde\nx \n(1\n99\n5 \n= \n10\n0)\nSeries1\nLinear trend\nFigure 14: Producer Price Index for 1995 to present with trend projection \n \n \n 17\n                                                                                                                                            \nThe cost removal process starts from the list of identified new technologies to be estimated. \nFrom this list, the model compares what had cost associated historically to a particular system \nand therefore included in the database associated with regression analysis. If the technology \nhad an attributed historical cost, the identification goes towards the current technology cost \nremoval. If the identified technology was a new area and did not have a historical cost \nassociated with it, it does not go towards cost removal. The cost removal process is based on \nthe same input as the new technology identification. From the database of engines used for \nthe regression analysis, each system within each engine was attributed a percentage based \non system cost versus engine cost. These percentages were then averaged to provide a \ngeneric engine cost percentage breakdown; Figure 15 provides an example of the data. The \nhistorical percentage attributable to each new technology is then identified and added \ntogether to give a total percentage to be removed from the calculated current technology \nengine cost. \nComparison number 1 2 Average\n03 00 00 ENGINE SYSTEM 1000 % 700 % %\n03 01 00 Basic Engine Structure Subsystem 307.00 30.70% 268.00 38.29% 32.46%\n03 01 01 Cylinder Block 150.00 15.00% 150.00 21.43% 12.31%\n03 01 02 Cylinder Heads 100.00 10.00% 85.00 12.14% 12.31%\n03 01 03 Intake Manifold 40.00 4.00% 30.00 4.29% 4.62%\n03 01 04 Exhaust Manifold 15.00 1.50% 2.00 0.29% 3.08%\n03 01 05 Flywheel Housing\/Adaptor 0.00 0.00% 0.00 0.00% 0.00%\n03 01 06 Engine Lifting Eyes 2.00 0.20% 1.00 0.14% 0.15%\n03 02 00 Engine Lubrication Subsystem 49.00 4.90% 38.00 5.43% 5.38%\n03 02 01 Oil Pump and Screen 20.00 2.00% 15.00 2.14% 3.08%\n03 02 02 Oil Filter, Dip Stick and Filler 2.00 0.20% 3.00 0.43% 0.15%\n03 02 03 Oil Pan and Reservoirs 25.00 2.50% 15.00 2.14% 0.62%\n03 02 04 Engine Oil Cooler 0.00 0.00% 0.00 0.00% 0.77%\n03 02 05 Oil Distribution 0.00 0.00% 0.00 0.00% 0.00%\n03 02 06 Engine Lubricant 2.00 0.20% 5.00 0.71% 0.77%  \nFigure 15: A generic breakdown of engine costs \nPredicted values with confidence limits of means\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n6 8 7 3 4 1 2 18 17 13 11 14 9 12 10 15 16 5\n(th\nou\n)\nEngine data points\nC\nos\nt (\n$)\nActual\nPredicted\n95% LCL\n95% UCL\n \n 18\n                                                                                                                                            \nFigure 16: Predicted costs versus actual costs \nOnce all the costs have been collated, and any adjustments made depending on the user\u2019s \nrequest, the model will report a summary of the estimate as described in the following section. \n \n8 Results output \nThe model is implemented in Excel. The key deliverable to this part of the programme was \nthat all results produced were to be automatically generated onto a result page. Therefore, a \nuser interface was developed that gave the estimator the current situation of the estimate \nwithout having to manually input any additional data. For ease of use and easy reference, the \nresults page was divided into four key areas: the general environment in which the estimate \nhas been created, the powertrain details that are being estimated and the page detail \nchanges depending on the type of powertrain being investigated, the new technology \nbreakdown, and the total cost estimate for the powertrain. \n \n9 Cost Model Validation \nTwo case studies were used to evaluate the model. The first study was of a combustion \nengine that had recently been introduced into production within the company but had not \nbeen included in the original data set, while the second study tested the model when the base \npowertrain was not a combustion engine. The model and processes were validated by \nestimating the cost of these products and comparing them with the actual data from the true \ncost. Prior to the case studies, the engine-input data used to capture the drivers were re-input \ninto the model to determine the predicted cost versus the actual cost. Figure 16 shows the \nresults. A spark ignition engine of four cylinders inline configuration was selected for the first \nstudy. Design of the product was conducted on a worldwide basis with the assumption that it \nwould be the new multipurpose power unit for new vehicles and therefore is available in many \nconfigurations for different applications. As suggested in the model development, this data \nwas obtained from the system design assumption list. \n \nThe complete list was analysed to determine the content of new technology. The identified \nsystems and component assemblies totalled greater than the amount of new technology \n 19\n                                                                                                                                            \nareas able to be entered. Therefore, either the systems were grouped together, if appropriate, \nor omitted if deemed insignificant. The five systems that needed to be run through the new \ntechnologies costing suite were Engine Structure, Engine Lubrication, Emissions Control, \nEngine Sealing, and Power Conversion. \n \nThe new technology systems were then identified as to their specific new developments, with \nsimilar components present on different engines being used as the base comparators. In \norder to compare the estimated cost to the actual powertrain in production, the confidential \nnature of the cost of the engine within the company means the following statements become \nmore ambiguous. All the data and relationships on the predicted value graph are true. \nAlthough a different engine is present on the graph, similar powertrains are present. \nInterpolating between the nearest units to the case study puts the cost within the confidence \nlimits stated. Figure 17 presents the results of the model output for this case study; expert \ncost estimators within Ford found the results to be realistic.  \n \nIn the second case study, a new technology was used to test the model with no carry over \ntechnology, this being fuel cells. Most major automobile manufacturers plan to launch a fuel \ncell powered vehicle by 2003\/2004, with reasonable volumes achieved by 2007. Therefore, \n2007 will be used as the year of implementation input in the model. Published data states that \n60kW to 85kW is more realistic in the shorter term, keeping costs as low as possible[14]. This \nreport states that using a carbon polymer composite cell would help to achieve a cost goal of \nunder $30 per kW. The data used as the basis for this statement is that volume is the main \ncontributor to cost reductions for this technology; therefore, a reasonable total volume \nproduced will be set at 450,000 units. The other inputs required for the model were: \n \n\u0089 Net fuel cell power output   (kW) \n\u0089 Total cell platinum catalyst loading (mg\/cm\u00b2) \n\u0089 Cell peak power density   (W\/cm\u00b2) \n \n 20\n                                                                                                                                            \n \nFigure 17: Combustion engine case study model result \n \n \n 21\n                                                                                                                                            \n  \nFigure 18: Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell case study model results \n \nIf the results of this study are compared to the statements made in reference 15, then the \ncosts are slightly higher than expected at $31.8 per kW, but are in the correct region. Figure \n18 presents the actual results, although they cannot be verified against any confidence limits \nor past data since the result and the CER are based on research that has yet to occur. The \nresults were validated qualitatively by a cost estimating manager and three practicing cost \nestimators. They agreed the results are reasonable. \n \n \n 22\n                                                                                                                                            \n10 Discussion of the models \nSeveral areas of the cost model could be improved with further research or development. \nEnvironmental complexity means it is impossible to model all eventualities and scenarios, and \nso the most important environment factors needed to be identified. For current technology, \nmultiple regression was used to model the environment. This technique has been thoroughly \nresearched over time and so, if all assumptions of the technique have been met, the user can \nbe confident of the result being within the upper and lower control limits. However, the generic \nnew technology estimating section of the model is a more significant limitation of the \napproach. Research within this project identified a CER for proton exchange membrane fuel \ncells that was introduced into the model to enhance the subject area of new technology cost \nmodelling. A different source for the comparator cost is needed if the new technology is \ndifferent to proton exchange membrane fuel cells. The research methodology also made \nseveral assumptions for the future direction of the project. This included a stage in the \ndevelopment of a concept that a technology is ready to be implemented into a future \nproduction programme, which would also be ideal to initiate a cost estimate from this model. \nThis would be ideal if resources allowed each new concept to be costed at the concept \nimplementation stage. However, many different concepts reach this stage but not the final \nstages of development. The correlation between prototypes and final production systems was \nanother area identified for potential inclusion in the model.  \n \nAn element of risk is involved when using this model. The most significant risk is that the \nmodel gives a single point estimate, and so it is unlikely that the cost of the powertrain will \nmatch the estimate produced when the product is a concept. Confidence limits are \nestablished when the regression analysis formulates an R-squared value, and, in the case of \nthis research, the confidence limit was targeted at 95%. A second major risk within the model \nis the subjectivity of the new technology cost movement from the comparator technology. In \norder to enable consistency and repeatability between users and occurrences, the process \nhas been developed with the removal of as much subjectivity as possible. However, unless a \nsingle answer can be input with the model calculating all further iterations, the model will \nalways have subjectivity. Other inherent risks are the assumptions that have been made to \n 23\n                                                                                                                                            \nbuild the model [9]. The model user must be aware of all of these assumptions and their affect \non the estimate [12]. The literature survey focused on several areas of cost estimating, \nincluding the diverse ways that different organisations and industries have attempted to \nestimate new technology or projects that are not due to be completed for several years. One \nof the downfalls of the survey is that the companies were unwilling to disclose their methods. \nAnother point revealed by the literature survey is that most cost estimating routines depend \non the circumstances the estimate is required for and the information available at the time of \nestimate request. The logical step from this would be for the estimator to be furnished with a \nrange of tools, all adapted and optimised for automotive, high volume production, and the \nknowledge to utilise these tools and the information available to the best advantage. Risk \nanalysis of the estimates was not developed in the cost model. Several key factors have been \naddressed within the model, including CERs on powertrain system technology using either \ncurrent combustion engine concepts or the as-yet-to-be introduced proton exchange \nmembrane fuel cell. Several other relationships are published within this model, including \nvolume relationships on the system, future economics, and system cost attributes.  \n \nThe ability to scale up was a key concern when developing the model. Most work in this area \nwould be the addition of CERs for other new technologies as and when required. Developing \nother areas of the vehicle would require considerable research that leads to the development \nof a separate model, since the other areas (body, chassis, and electrical engineering) are \nquite diverse. The smaller capacity combustion engine is an area within the model that would \nbenefit from further research. As demonstrated in Figure 16, the cheaper end of the graph \nmight have started to diverge away from the predicted values. It will not be known what \nrepresents the true world data until further engines are added to the database in this area. \nAdditional benefit would be gained if the volume influence relationship was researched in \ngreater depth. The model within this research was depicted from one manufacturing plant. \nThe CER would be more robust if other plants were added. \n \n \n \n 24\n                                                                                                                                            \n11 Conclusions \n \nIt can be concluded from the research that: \na. A structured methodology to perform cost estimating for products with high \nlevels of new technology does not exist. \nb. Three types of new technology can be used in cost estimating: new to \norganisation, new to industry, and new to mankind. \nc. A methodology to separate the use of current technology versus new \ntechnology in a product has been developed. \nd. A structured methodology has been developed for cost estimating new \ntechnology-intensive products. \ne. The methodology has been implemented in an Excel spreadsheet and \nevaluated through two case studies. \nf. The limitations of the models and the research methodology have been \nidentified. \n \nThe inclusion of risk analysis and confidence in a reported estimate is one area where the \nmodel would benefit from further research. This tool would provide an added dimension to \ndecision-makers within an automotive company, either to further develop technologies or \nfocus on certain high cost elements. Including risk analysis would expand the model \nscenarios and allow the business decision to be based upon more robust fundamentals. The \nmodel currently produces an estimate that details a cost with a known confidence, but fails to \nnot detail what would happen if elements of the estimate were changed. It is not possible to \nuse this model to manage day-to-day costs incurred in a manufacturing facility, but it is ideal \nfor developing strategies or estimates for products that are only in the concept stages of \ndevelopment.  \n \n \n \n \n \n 25\n                                                                                                                                            \n12 References \n [1] Kee, R., Schmidt, C.
