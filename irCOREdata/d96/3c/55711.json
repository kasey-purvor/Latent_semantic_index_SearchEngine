Research over the past \ndecade has increasingly indicated that changes in the subarctic North West Pacific Ocean were critical in  \ndriving the global  climate system from the warm, stable,  conditions that  prevailed during the early\/mid  \nPliocene to the glacial-interglacial  cycles that  characterise the late Pliocene\/Quaternary era (Haug et al.,  \n1999, 2005; Sigman et al., 2004; Swann et al., 2006; Reynolds et al., 2008). These changes are marked by  \nthe influx of large volumes of freshwater at the onset of major Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (NHG) at  \n2.73 Ma, culminating in the transition from a mixed to a halocline, stratified, water column. With deep water \nin the region rich in  CO2,  the shift from an unstratified (upwelling) to stratified (no\/minimal deep water \nupwelling) state has been associated with a significant reduction in surface water concentrations of  CO2 \n(pCO2), reducing oceanic ventilation of CO2 to the atmosphere and further permitting glacial advancement \nacross the Northern Hemisphere (Haug et al., 1999).\nIn spite  of  the  considerable  palaeoceanographic  research that  has  been undertaken in  understanding the \nchanges from a unstratified to stratified water column at 2.73 Ma, comparatively little research has been  \ncarried out to investigate further water column re-organizations during the glacial-interglacial cycles which  \nfollow this interval during the late Piacenzian (3.60-2.59 Ma) and Gelasian (2.59-1.81 Ma). In part this can  \nbe attributed to the the absence of sufficient numbers of foraminifera and other carbonate fossils  in the  \nsediment  record  for  isotope\/geochemical  analyses.  Furthermore,  low  opal  MAR  and  other  record  of  \nproductivity  have  been  interpreted  to  indicate  that  a  stratified  water  column prevailed  largely,  but  not  \ncompletely, without interruption from 2.73 Ma through to the modern day (Haug et al., 1999; Sigman et al.,  \n2004; Gebhardt et al.,  2008). However, low resolution variations in diatom  \u03b418O (\u03b418Odiatom)  and Uk37 Sea \nSurface Temperature (SST) of c. 5.0\u2030 and 9oC respectively from 2.73-2.61 Ma (Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) \nG6 to MIS 104) suggest that the region may have experienced marked changes in the post-2.73 Ma interval \nsimilar to those that occurred during the initial development of the halocline at 2.73 Ma (Haug et al., 2005; \nSwann et al., 2006).\n2\/20\nUncorrected copy\nAt present the origin, temporal variability and implication for these changes remain unknown, particularly  \nwith regards to their impact on the strength of the regional halocline. Any weakening\/strengthening of the \nhalocline would be significant in altering the flux of nutrients and CO2 rich deep water into the photic zone. \nDepending on the response of the biological pump, such changes could have altered the regional flux of CO 2 \nbetween the oceans\/atmosphere (c.f.  Gebhardt  et al.,  2008) and so altered the  global carbon budget and \nclimatic  changes  over  the  Pliocene\/Quaternary  boundary.  Here,  in  order  to  better  understand  the \npalaeoceanography of the subarctic North West Pacific Ocean, existing  \u03b418Odiatom records are extended and \nincreased in  resolution for  the  interval  from 2.73 Ma to 2.52 Ma (MIS G6-MIS 99)  at  Ocean Drilling  \nProgram (ODP) Site 882.\n2 Methods\nSediment samples from ODP Site 882 (Fig.  1) were prepared for diatom isotope analysis using techniques \npreviously employed at this site (Swann et al., 2006; 2008). Samples were treated with 30% H 2O2 and 5% \nHCl to remove organic material and carbonates respectively before being repeatedly mixed with sodium \npolytungstate at a series of specific gravities from 2.10 g\/ml to 2.25 g\/ml prior to a final sieving with a 5 \u03bcm \ncellulose nitrate membrane filter to remove all non-diatom contaminants. Previous research has demonstrated \na possible size\/species vital effect in \u03b418Odiatom (Swann et al., 2007, 2008). Here such issues are circumvented \nby sieving and retaining solely the 75-150 \u03bcm size fraction for isotope analysis which is dominated by only \ntwo taxa (see Section 3). Sample purity was assessed through a combination of both light microscopy and  \nScanning Light Microscopy (SEM) with contaminated samples either re-cleaned or disregarded for isotope  \nanalysis. For light microscopy, sub-samples of the  purified diatoms were mounted on a coverslip using a \nNaphrax\u00ae mounting media and checked for contamination on a 100 \u03bcm x 100 \u03bcm grid graticule following \nthe semi-quantitative method of Morley et al., (2004). Diatom biovolumes were simultaneously assessed for \neach sample following the recommendations of Hillebrand et al., (1999) to determine the species origin of  \nthe isotope signal (see Swann et al., 2008 for further details). SEM analysis to verify sample purity and the  \n3\/20\nUncorrected copy\nreliability of the light microscopy observations were completed on randomly selected samples. Ages were \ncalculated  using  a  linear  interpolation  of  sedimentation  rates  between  tie-points  derived  from  the \nastronomical  calibrated  of  high  resolution  GRAPE  density  and  magnetic  susceptibility  measurements \n(Tiedemann and Haug, 1995).\n\u03b418Odiatom was analysed using the step-wise fluorination methodology described in Leng and Sloane (2008). In \nbrief, \u03b418Odiatom was analysed with diatom -Si-OH layers stripped during a pre-fluorination outgassing stage in  \nnickel reaction tubes using a BrF5 regent at 250oC  for six minutes. Remaining oxygen from the -Si-O-Si \nlayer was subsequently dissociated overnight using an excess of reagent at 550 oC with oxygen subsequently \nconverted to CO2 following the methodology of Clayton and Mayeda (1963). Following extraction, CO2 was \nanalysed for \u03b418O using a Finnegan MAT 253 with values converted to the SMOW scale using a within-run \nlaboratory diatom standard (BFCmod) calibrated against NBS28. Analytical reproducibility for  \u03b418Odiatom was \n0.3\u2030 (1\u03c3).\n3 Results\nSEM and light microscopy observations indicate the lack of contamination within the analysed samples with  \nsample purity constantly above 94% and typically between 98% and 100% (see Swann et al., 2006). Samples  \nare dominated  by two taxa, Coscinodiscus marginatus (Ehrenb.) and Coscinodiscus radiatus (Ehrenb.), the \nrelative  biovolumes  of  which  vary  throughout  the  core  (Fig.  2).  No  correlation  or  relationships  exists \nbetween \u03b418Odiatom and C. marginatus\/C. radiatus from 2.73 Ma to 2.52 Ma (r = -0.06\/0.07), indicating the \nabsence of species disequilibrium\/isotope vital effects.\nMeasurements  of  \u03b418Odiatom can  be  interpreted  in  the  same  way  as  \u03b418O measurements  of  planktonic \nforaminifera (\u03b418Oforam) (Swann and Leng, 2009). Accordingly, variations in \u03b418Odiatom reflect changes in global \nice  volume,  SST and\/or  changes  in  the  \u03b418O composition  of  the  ambient  water  within  the  photic  zone \n(\u03b418Owater). Following the development of the halocline stratification system at 2.73 Ma, marked by a decrease \n4\/20\nUncorrected copy\nin \u03b418Odiatom  of 4.6\u2030 (Swann et al., 2006), values of \u03b418Odiatom remain low at c. 39-40\u2030 before subsequently \nrising to 43.4\u2030 at 2.69 Ma (Fig.  3). Following this transition at MIS G6, cyclic changes are apparent in \n\u03b418Odiatom that are broadly in line with changes in glacial-interglacial conditions as monitored by a global  \nstacked benthic \u03b418Oforam record (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005). This is marked by \u03b418Odiatom values of \u226542.0\u2030 \nduring interglacials,  similar to conditions prior to 2.73 Ma in a mixed water column, with lower values  \nprevalent during glacials. Of note are the relatively low opal MAR and prevalence of warm, c. 15-18oC Uk37 \nSST through these transitions until MIS 103 when peak SST decrease below 10OC before rising again to 13-\n15oC for MIS 102-99 (Haug et al., 2005) (Fig. 3).\nSuperimposed on these long-term changes in \u03b418Odiatom are a series of short-lived fluctuations of c. 1-2\u2030. This \nis most apparent during MIS G1 and MIS 103 and indicate that the region was characterised by significant  \nenvironmental changes over relatively short timeframes.  The exception to this glacial-interglacial pattern \noccurs during MIS G5 and MIS 101-100. For MIS G5 the failure for  \u03b418Odiatom to increase above glacial \nvalues of c. 40.0\u2030 may simply reflect the extremely low resolution isotope record through this interval as  \nwell as the low magnitude nature of interglacial relative to other glacial-interglacial changes. However with \nthe shift to higher \u03b418Odiatom values during MIS 101 occurring during the second half of the interglacial at 2.56 \nMa and continuing through the beginning of MIS 100, any link between  \u03b418Odiatom and glacial-interglacial \ncycles are tentative until investigation are conducted over longer time-frames and\/or at other sites.\n4 Discussion\nThe nature of the water column prior to 2.73 Ma, the transition to a halocline water column at this interval  \nand the divergent trends in the  \u03b418Odiatom and planktonic  \u03b418Oforam records  have previously been described \n(Haug et al., 1999; 2005; Sigman et al., 2004; Swann et al., 2006; Reynolds et al., 2008). The discussion \nbelow is therefore restricted to examining the changes in \u03b418Odiatom following the 4.6\u2030 decrease in \u03b418Odiatom \nand development of the regional halocline at 2.73 Ma.\n5\/20\nUncorrected copy\n4.1 Freshwater inputs\nIn the absence of a high resolution  \u03b418Odiatom record,  it  is  not  possible to  investigate leads\/lags between \nchanges in \u03b418Odiatom and benthic \u03b418Oforam\/glacial-interglacial state. However the cyclic nature of the \u03b418Odiatom \nrecord from 2.73 Ma onwards that broadly occurs over glacial-interglacial cycles, combined with the large  \nisotope changes of up to 6\u2030, suggest that the region experienced large scale palaeoceanographic changes  \nduring the late Pliocene\/early Quaternary era. Typical glacial-interglacial change in SST over this interval, \nranging  up  to  c.  3OC,  can  only  account  for  c.  0.6\u2030 of  the  change  in  \u03b418Odiatom when  using  a  diatom-\ntemperature coefficients of 0.2 \u2030\/oC (Brandriss et al., 1998; Moschen et al., 2005). Similarly, whole ocean \nchanges in \u03b418O due to variations in global ice volume are on the order of 0.8\u2030 (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005).  \nAs such the large fluctuations in \u03b418Odiatom of up to 6\u2030 over glacial-interglacial cycles must predominantly \nreflect a change in surface water  \u03b418Owater,  which can be calculated from  \u03b418Odiatom using a global stacked \nbenthic  \u03b418Oforam record (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005) and accounting for changes in SST using a Uk37 SST \nrecord from ODP Site 882 (Haug et al., 2005) and a diatom-temperature coefficient of 0.2\u2030\/ oC (Brandriss et \nal., 1998; Moschen et al., 2005) (Fig.  4a).  Whilst the initial decrease in  \u03b418Odiatom and shift to a halocline \nsystem at c.  2.73 may have been linked to the closure of the Panama Ocean gateway and an associated \nreduction in the Pacific Ocean deep water thermohaline circulation (Motoi et al., 2005), such a mechanism is \nnot applicable to explain subsequent changes in \u03b418Odiatom after this interval. Similarly, increases\/decreases in \nthe  influx  of  water  from regions  south  of  ODP Site  882  are  unlikely  to  explain  the  large  changes  in  \n\u03b418Owater\/\u03b418Odiatom given that North West Pacific Ocean waters differ from the mid-latitude and tropical Pacific  \nby only c. 1\u2030 (LeGrande and Schmidt, 2006). Although the expansion of sea-ice in the Bering Sea over the  \nonset of major NHG may lead to variations in the \u03b418O of water flowing from the north into the subarctic \nNorth West Pacific Ocean (IODP Expedition 323, Scientists, 2010), such variations are likely to be low given \nfractionation factors of 1.0026\u20131.0035 (Majoube, 1971; Lehmann and Siegenthaler, 1991; Macdonald et al.,  \n1995).  Accordingly,  two processes  exist  to  explain the  large changes in  \u03b418Owater and  \u03b418Odiatom.  First  are \nchanges in Asian summer monsoon which may deliver freshwater both through direct changes in regional \nprecipitation and\/or via increased continental riverine inputs to the marine system via the Kuroshio current.  \n6\/20\nUncorrected copy\nSuch a process has previously been proposed to have driven the transition from a mixed to stratified water  \ncolumn between 2.83-2.75 Ma (Nie et al., 2008).  Second are increases in glacial meltwater to the region, \nwhich will be significantly enriched in 16O relative to 18O.\nRecords of SSS at ODP Site 1143 in the South China Sea suggest a progressive decrease in SSS from 2.73 \nMa to 2.50 Ma in response to increased monsoonal precipitation and fluvial inputs (Tian et al., 2004, 2006).  \nHowever these local salinity changes, accounting for a c. 1\u2030 fluctuation in \u03b4 18Owater over glacial-interglacial \ncycles, from an area strongly influenced by the East Asian monsoon are considerable smaller than those  \nobserved here at the more remote, open ocean, ODP Site 882. Consequently, it is difficult to envisage how  \nsufficient fluvial quantities of monsoonal freshwater could have been delivered to ODP Site 882 to explain \nthe changes in \u03b418Odiatom. The relative importance of monsoonal activity can be further assessed using records \nof accumulation and magnetic susceptibility at the Chinese Loess Plateau in addition to Hm\/Gt ratios from \nODP Site 1143 in the South China Sea as a proxy for Asian monsoon precipitation (Sun and An, 2005; Sun et  \nal.,  2006; Zhang et al., 2009) (Fig,  2).  Again, no significant relationship can be observed between these \nrecords and changes in \u03b418Odiatom at ODP Site 882. Although lower \u03b418Odiatom values from MIS G6-G4 coincide \nwith increased monsoon activity and vice-versa during MIS G3, changes subsequent to this fail to follow a  \nsimilar pattern with intervals of higher\/lower \u03b418Odiatom occurring during periods of both high and low, as well \nas increasing and decreasing, monsoon activity. Accordingly, although changes in monsoon activity can not \nbe completely eliminated,  based on  the absence of  any clear  relationship and problems with delivering \nsufficient quantities of monsoonal freshwater to ODP Site 882, it is likely that its role in instigating the  \nobserved \u03b418Odiatom variations be minimal compared to other mechanisms.\nInstead, it is proposed that decreases\/increases in \u03b418Odiatom are primarily driven by increases\/decreases in \nglacial meltwater input to the North Pacific Ocean over glacials\/interglacials, as well as within the short term \nfluctuations in \u03b418Odiatom for individual marine isotope stages. Whilst  speculative, an advantage of such a  \nmechanisms is  that  comparatively  less  water  is  needed to  drive  the observed changes  in  \u03b4 18Odiatom than \n7\/20\nUncorrected copy\nmonsoonal inputs due to the significantly more negative \u03b418O value of glacial sourced meltwater. Evidence \nfrom the North Atlantic Ocean showing that the \u03b418O of glacial ice in the Pliocene was lower than the late \nPleistocene  provides  a  further  means  of  potentially  explaining  the  marked  decrease  in  \u03b418Odiatom during \nglacials (Bailey et al., 2010).  Numerous sites may be acting as the source for any glacial meltwater to the  \nregion including the Bering Sea Basin, the Okhotsk and Kamchatka regions of Siberia as well as possible \ninputs from the Aleutian Islands and Southern Alaska (e.g., Kotilainen and Shackleton, 1995; McKelvey et \nal., 1995; St John and Krissek, 1999; Bigg et al., 2008). Due to the unknown isotopic composition of these  \nice-sheets and without knowing the relative contributions of meltwater from each locality, it is not possible to \naccurately calculate the salinity:\u03b418O relationship for meltwater entering the region and so quantify actual \nchanges in salinity. The range of possible Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) variability can, however, be estimated  \nby using two extreme SSS:\u03b418O ratio end-members of 1 and 0.5.  Such end-member calculations,  which \nassumes  that  the  end-member  relationship  remains  constant  either  at  1  or  0.5  throughout  the  analysed \ninterval, indicates that SSS may have varied by up to 8 psu over the analysed interval with typical glacial-\ninterglacial changes of 2-4 psu (Fig. 4b). These changes are comparable to SSS fluctuation of up to 4 psu in \nthe North Atlantic Ocean during Heinrich events (Duplessy et al.  1993; Maslin et al., 1995; Seidov and \nMaslin, 1999), suggesting that similar magnitude meltwater events\/ice surges may have marked the North  \nPacific Ocean over this interval. \nOn the one hand is it  hard to envisage that ice-sheets around the North Pacific Basin would have been  \nsufficiently developed during the late Pliocene to instigate a Heinrich equivalent event at ODP Site 882 given \nits  open ocean position  south  of  the  sea-ice  extent.  However,  strong evidence  exists  of  increased  IRD \ndeposition at ODP Site 882 from 2.73 Ma, with changes broadly occurring in line with glacial-interglacial  \ncycles and fluctuations in \u03b418Odiatom, suggests that regional ice-sheets were significantly developed over this \ninterval (Krissek, 1995; Maslin et al., 1996; Haug et al., 1999) (Fig.  3). Evidence from the North Atlantic \nOcean has also suggested a possible low threshold for ice-surging events in the Pliocene (Bailey et al., 2010).  \nOne scenario is that an initial strengthening of the water column stratification occurs at the beginning of each  \n8\/20\nUncorrected copy\nglacial\/SSS decrease following an initial meltwater surge or reduced deep water exchanges. With subsequent  \nmeltwater inputs further strengthening the halocline and reducing any mixing\/dispersion of the low \u03b4 18O \nwaters  into  the  sub-surface  layers,  a  positive  feedback  mechanism  is  established  that  continues  until  \nmeltwater input ceases. Under this chain of events, considerable less meltwater input is required to generate  \nthe observed changes in SSS than would be expected at other open ocean sites around the globe.\nAdditional  short-term changes in meltwater input  to the region may have been further enhanced by the  \nopening\/closure of the Bering Sea Straits. Whilst Pliocene changes remain unconstrained, (Matthiessen et al.,  \n2009), sea-level fluctuations of 40-80 m (Miller et al., 2005) suggest the status of the Bering Straits gateway \nmay have undergone several changes over both long, glacial-interglacial, and shorter, millennial, timescales \nbetween MIS G6 and MIS 99. An open gateway would typically be expected to increase flow through the  \nBering Straits and into the North Atlantic Ocean (Marincovich and Gladenkov, 1999). Depending on the \ntiming of the straits closure, increased export of fresher water from the North Pacific\/Bering Sea into the  \nNorth Atlantic Ocean during the initial, c. 4 psu, SSS decline at 2.73 Ma and subsequent interglacial\/glacial  \ntransitions could have assisted in the permanent glaciation of Greenland by lowering SST and SSS in the  \nEast Greenland Current and reducing Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) (Sarnthein et al., 2009).  \nAlone these changes would not significantly alter the SSS or \u03b418Owater at ODP Site 882. However in an open \ngateway state, models have demonstrated that the direction of Arctic throughflow can reverse following a \nMOC shut down, increasing the input of isotopically light water to the Bering Sea  and so North Pacific  \nOcean via flow across the Aleutian Island Arc and Kamchatka Straits (De Boer and Nof, 2004a,b; Hu and \nMeehl, 2005; Hu et al., 2007). Similarly in a closed state the reduced export of freshwater from the North \nPacific\/Bering Sea to the North Atlantic can increase MOC (Hu et al., 2010), potentially increasing glacier  \nmelting around the North Pacific\/Bering Sea Basin and so further lower SSS at ODP Site 882. Whilst both \nthese processes are short-lived, ranging from years to decades for reversed Arctic flow (De Boer and Nof,  \n2004b) and centennial to millennial timescales for increased MOC\/glacial melting (Hu et al., 2010), and so \ninsufficient to explain the long-term glacial-interglacial changes in SSS at ODP Site 882, these processes \n9\/20\nUncorrected copy\nmay be important  for  understanding the abrupt  short-term SSS variations  that  are  apparent  during both \ninterglacial and glacial eras (Fig. 4b).\nAlthough much of this discussion remains circumstantial and whilst  the relationship between changes in  \n\u03b418Odiatom and glacial\/interglacial state remains poorly constrained, invoking a glacial meltwater mechanism \ncombined with possible additional inputs arising from changes in the Bering Straits gateway remains at this  \ntime the most pragmatic explanation for the observed changes in \u03b418Odiatom. Given the above assumptions in \ncalculating changes in SSS and the lack of consideration for mixing processes which would have further \naltered  the  SSS:\u03b418O  end-member  during  the  transportation  of  fresh\/meltwater  to  ODP Site  882,  the \nreconstructed values should not be regarded as absolute indication of SSS change. In addition, given that  \ncalculated changes in \u03b418Owater and SSS are closely driven by \u03b418Odiatom with only negligible contributions from \nchanges in SST (Haug et al., 2005) and global ice volume (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005), it is necessary for \nthese findings to be replicated  at other sites including those in the Bering Sea.\n4.2 Halocline water column\nRepeated shift of \u03b418Odiatom during the interglacials of MIS G3, G1, 103 and 101 to values in excess of +42\u2030, \nequivalent to those in the interval prior to the onset of major NHG at 2.73 Ma would typically be expected to \ncoincide  with  alterations  between  a  mixed  (interglacial)\/stratified  (glacial)  water  column  if  rates  of  \ndecreased\/increased  meltwater  input  were  sufficient  to  overturn\/trigger  the  halocline.  This  would  be \nanalogous to  the  initial  transition from a mixed to  stratified water  column at  2.73 Ma which has  been \nassociated with a significant increase in freshwater input to the region (Sigman et al., 2004; Haug et al.,  \n2005; Swann et al., 2006; Nie et al., 2008). Three lines of evidence, however, suggest that an uninterrupted \nhalocline prevailed over the analysed interval.\nFirstly, a switch to a mixed water column would be expected to culminate in the upwelling of cold as well as  \nnutrient rich deep water to the surface, instigating increases in opal MAR and decreases in SST. Relatively \n10\/20\nUncorrected copy\nlow opal MAR of 0-1.2 g\/cm2\/ka and warm SST of >10oC, except in MIS 103 and the end of MIS 101, \ntherefore suggest that there was no reversal  to a mixed,  high productivity, system similar  to that which  \nprevailed prior to 2.73 Ma (Haug et al., 1999; 2005) (Fig. 3). Given that diatom growth in the modern North \nPacific Ocean is constrained by iron limitation (e.g.,  Harrison et al., 1999; Tsuda et al.,  2003; Yuan and \nZhang,  2006),  it  is  plausible  that  similar  mechanisms prevailed  from MIS G5  onwards  to  prevent  any  \nincrease in opal concentrations in a mixed water column state. At open sites such as ODP Site 882 situated  \naway from continental influences, Fe availability is primarily controlled by aeolian deposition (Duce and  \nTindale, 1991; Jickells et al., 2005) which in the North West Pacific Ocean predominantly originates from \nthe Badain Juran Desert, China (Yuan and Zhang, 2006). Records at other sites in the North Pacific over the \nlast 200 ka BP have documented changes in aeolian fluxes aligned with accumulation rates at the Chinese  \nLoess Plateau (Kawahata et al., 2000). If changes in Chinese Loess MAR are similarly used over the interval  \nfrom 2.73 Ma to 2.52 Ma as a tracer of aeolian and so iron flux to ODP Site 882, the influence of iron  \navailability  on biological  productivity  can be discounted with no relationship between changes in  loess \naccumulation and opal MAR (Fig. 3). Accordingly, the absence of any significant rise in opal concentrations \ncan be attributed to the change in SSS being insufficient to remove the halocline stratification rather than the  \npresence of an iron limited mixed water column.\nA second line of evidence to suggest a permanent halocline originates from comparisons of the \u03b4 18Odiatom and \nplanktonic \u03b418Oforam data from ODP Site 882. Modern day C. marginatus and C. radiatus diatom frustules in \nthe region primarily bloom during autumn\/early winter (Takahashi, 1986; Takahashi et al., 1996; Onodera et  \nal., 2005). As such, in a stratified state, changes in the input of isotopically light\/heavy waters would have \naffected conditions in the uppermost part of the surface ocean at depths extending down to the seasonal late  \nsummer-early winter thermocline at 50 m and potentially to the halocline at c. 100-150 m (Andreev et al., \n2002; Antonov et al 2006;  Locarnini et al., 2006).  Although planktonic \u03b418Oforam records are of insufficient \nresolution  to  provide  further  information  as  to  the  origin  of  the  isotopically  light\/heavy water  (Fig.  3) \n(Maslin et al., 1996, 1998), it is notable that Globigerina bulloides and Neogloboquadrina pachyderma are \n11\/20\nUncorrected copy\noften found at  much lower  depths  within the  surface ocean including at  depths  below the modern day  \nhalocline (Kohfield et al., 1996; Kuroyanagi and Kawahata, 2004). The absence of any marked alteration in \nthe low resolution planktonic \u03b418Oforam after 2.73 Ma, compared to \u03b418Odiatom, therefore imply that water inputs \nwere restricted to the uppermost parts of the photic zone and did not extend into deeper sections of the \nsurface ocean as would be expected in a mixed water column scenario (Fig. 3). Due to the extreme scarcity \nof preserved foraminifera in the sediment record, additional planktonic \u03b418Oforam measurements can not be \nmade to further assess issues regarding the vertical penetration of any freshwater inputs.\nFinal,  quantitative,  evidence for  a  permanent  halocline  can be found be  calculating the  change in  SSS \nrequired to initiate an overturning of the stratification. Modern day waters above the halocline (c. 100-150  \nm) around ODP Site 882 are marked by year round potential densities (\u03c3 \u03b8 for  \u03c1 = 0) of <26.8 kg\/m3 (c.f., \nFofonoff and Millard 1983; Antonov et al., 2005; Locarnini et al., 2005). By assuming that a density of 26.8 \nkg\/m3 is also applicable for the halocline boundary in the Pliocene\/early Quaternary and using a coccolith  \nUk37 SST record from ODP Site 882 (Haug et al., 2005), the SSS required to obtain a potential density >26.8  \nkg\/m3 and so water column overturning can be back calculated using seawater equations of state (Fofonoff  \nand Millard 1983). With regional fluxes of coccoliths similar to the analysed diatom taxa in being focused  \ntowards autumn\/early winter (Ohkouchi et al., 1999; Harada et al., 2006; Seki et al., 2007 ), results will be  \nrepresentative of the months when overturning would be expected to occur. Results, however, show that the \nnecessary SSS required to remove the halocline and generate deep water mixing, i.e., to increase the photic  \nzone potential density to >26.8 kg\/m3, is never reached except at 2.65 Ma (Fig. 4b). In particular, calculations \nshow that where SSS is greater than that in the mixed water column prior to 2.73 Ma, e.g., at the onset of  \nMIS G3, the higher SST that accompany these intervals are sufficient to counter-act these rises by lowering  \nthe potential density of the photic zone and so increase the salinity threshold needed to generate overturning.  \nChanging the potential density of the halocline boundary used in these calculations from 24.8 kg\/m 3 to 27.8 \nkg\/m3 alters the SSS threshold required for overturning by only 0.00-0.09 psu. Therefore it can be concluded  \nthat whilst significant, the reduced freshwater inputs to ODP Site 882 during interglacials from MIS G5 to \n12\/20\nUncorrected copy\nMIS 99 were insufficient to increase SSS to the levels required to generate deep water mixing.\nWith regards to why no evidence exists for a short-lived transition to a mixed water column at 2.65 Ma when \nSSS are greater than the modelled SSS threshold required for overturning, one possibility is that the net  \ndecrease in rates of freshwater influx to the region were not enough on a seasonal\/annual timeframe to raise  \nSSS beyond the necessary threshold. Additional consideration must also be given to the accuracy of the  \nSSS:\u03b418O end-member used in the SSS reconstruction and the potential for the true end-member to be outside \nthe range used in Section 4.1. Whilst the possible range and temporal variability of SSS:\u03b418O end-members \nfor the North Pacific Basin are unknown over this interval, existing research has demonstrated that the \u03b4 18O \nvalues of individual ice-sheets vary considerably in Eurasia and North America at the Last Glacial Maximum \nwith values of \u221216\u2030 to \u221240\u2030 and \u221228\u2030 to \u221234\u2030 respectively (Duplessy et al., 2002). Further work is  \ntherefore required involving the use of regional ice-sheet\/ocean circulation models to fully investigate the \nnature and origin of increased freshwater input to the North West Pacific Ocean and the exact magnitude of  \nchange in SSS. \n5 Conclusions\nIn spite of large changes in  \u03b418Odiatom indicating significant variations in freshwater influx to the subarctic \nNorth West Pacific Ocean over the late Pliocene\/early Quaternary, no evidence exists to suggest that the \nhalocline stratification boundary was ever removed. Such findings concur with evidence of low opal MAR \nfrom 2.73 Ma onwards which indicate a transition to a stratified system and the region shifting from a major \nnet source to a minor net sink of CO2 potentially similar to the modern day (Haug et al., 1999; Honda et al., \n2002; Chierici et al., 2006). Given the magnitude of change in \u03b418Owater required to cause the observed shifts \nin \u03b418Odiatom and SSS, further research is needed through oceanic and climate models to assess the origin of  \nthe freshwater inputs to the region and to determine the extent  to which these inputs may have altered \nnutrient  fluxes  to  the  photic  zone  and  so  the  biological  pump.  The  most  logical  origin  for  increased \nfreshwater input, given the magnitude of \u03b418Odiatom changes, is for a glacial meltwater source. Although little \n13\/20\nUncorrected copy\nis known about the extent and size of glaciers around the North Pacific basin, attributing the changes in \n\u03b418Odiatom to primarily originate from such a source would imply that regional glaciers were well developed in  \nthe late Pliocene following the intensification of major Northern Hemisphere Glaciation. Understanding such \nissues  are  increasingly  important  given  the  potential  role  of  the  Pliocene  in  providing  an  analogue  for \ninvestigating future climate scenarios under a warmer climate (Jansen et al., 2007; Haywood et al., 2009).\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was funded by a NERC postdoctoral fellowship award to GEAS (NE\/F012969\/1).

ODP Site 882 magnetic susceptibility records displays both the raw data (grey) and a loess \ncurve (black).

For  planktonic  \u03b418Oforam,  black  (triangles)  and  blue  (circles)  records  represents  G. \nbulloides and N. pachyderma (dextral) respectively. Following Reynolds et al. (2008) the age of the stacked \nbenthic \u03b418Oforam record has been adjusted by +10 ka to position the Matuyama\/Gauss boundary at 2.61 Ma on \nthe orbital time scale (Deino et al., 2006). Shaded regions after the development of the halocline at 2.73 Ma \nindicates periods of high  \u03b418Odiatom values equivalent to those in the pre-2.73 Ma interval of mixed water \ncolumn conditions.\nFigure 4: A) Changes in surface water \u03b418Owater at ODP Site 882 calculated from \u03b418Odiatom by accounting for \nchanges  in  SST using  a  Uk37 SST record  (Haug  et  al.,  2005)  with  a  diatom-temperature  coefficient  of \n0.2\u2030\/oC (Brandriss et al., 1998; Moschen et al., 2005) and using a  global stacked benthic  \u03b418Oforam record \n(Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005) to correct  for variations in global ice volume. Fluxes of both the coccolith  \nderived  alkenones  and  analysed  diatoms  are  focused  towards  autumn\/early  winter  (Takahashi,  1986; \nTakahashi et al., 1996; Ohkouchi et al., 1999; Onodera et al., 2005; Harada et al., 2006; Seki et al., 2007).
