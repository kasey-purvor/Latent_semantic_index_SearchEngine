Introduction \n Industrial relations scholars and practitioners have long been concerned with questions of \nunion coverage and membership, from explaining union density trends (Bain and Price 1980; \nLipset et al. 2004), to predicting who joins unions (Farber and Saks 1980; Gomez et al. 2002), to \nanalyzing the characteristics of unionized workers and union members (Antos et al. 1980; \nBlanchflower 2007). The focus of these inquiries is typically those who are in or would join a \nunion. Bryson and Gomez (2003, 2005), however, uncover the importance of a previously-\nunrecognized group\u2014those who are never unionized. More specifically, Bryson and Gomez \n(2003, 2005) show that the fraction of British workers who are never union members increased \nfrom less than 30 percent in the early 1980s to nearly 50 percent in 2001. Schnabel and Wagner \n(2006) subsequently estimate never-membership rates around 55 percent in Germany in 2002.  \n In extending the never-unionized concept to the United States, we depart from the \napproach of Bryson and Gomez (2003, 2005) and Schnabel and Wagner (2006) by focusing on \nunion coverage rather than union membership. We are precluded from analyzing union \nmembership because of a lack of data, but union coverage is important in its own right. In the \nNorth American industrial relations system, union coverage is a frequently-analyzed indicator of \nunionization because covered workers\u2014members and nonmembers alike\u2014are legally-entitled to \nunion-negotiated wages and benefits, and to full union representation in the bargaining and \ngrievance processes. Therefore, whereas Bryson and Gomez (2003, 2005) and Schnabel and \nWagner (2006) appropriately use the term \u201cnever-member\u201d for their analyses, we use the term \n\u201cnever-unionized\u201d to describe an individual who never holds a unionized job and therefore is \nnever covered by a union contract or represented by a union.  \n Understanding never-unionization is important for several reasons. Never-unionization \n 1\ncan enrich our understanding of the labour market experience of U.S. workers over the life \ncourse by distinguishing between those who have episodic spells of unionization from those who \nnever hold unionized jobs. Never-unionization rates can complement union density rates in \ncreating a better understanding of the true impact and reach of labour unions. At any given time, \nless than 15 percent of U.S. workers are unionized, but our results reveal a much broader reach in \nthat two-thirds of workers are unionized at some point in their working lives. Also, research at an \nindividual level seeks to understand why individuals join unions or become unionized (Farber \nand Saks 1980; Gomez et al. 2002); labour movements around the world are also interested in \nthese issues as they try to stem the decline of unionism and revitalize themselves. Analyzing \nthose who are never-unionized can help researchers, union leaders, and policymakers understand \nwhy some workers do not become unionized, and thereby help shape future research, union \nstrategies, and public policies. Combining an understanding of the characteristics of the never-\nunionized with the predicted trends for these characteristics (e.g., educational or occupational \ntrends) can also provide clues about the future of the labour movement (Schnabel and Wagner \n2006). \n Uncovering never-unionization trends can also help us understand persistent declines in \naggregate union density trends. Bryson and Gomez (2003) and Gomez and Gunderson (2004) \nargue that unionism is an experience good\u2014that is, potential union workers can only fully \nunderstand the benefits of unionization by experiencing it firsthand because key aspects like the \nprovision of procedural fairness and voice are difficult for outsiders to observe. This experience \ngood aspect of unionization means that rising rates of never-unionization create a vicious cycle \nof self-perpetuating declining union density. If fewer workers experience unionism and see the \ntrue benefits, then fewer workers support unions and union density declines. This increases the \n 2\nnever-unionization rate and the cycle begins anew. We therefore not only analyze the rate of \nnever-unionization and the characteristics of the never-unionized, but also whether never-\nunionization is increasing.  \n To analyze never-unionization in the United States, we track 1,522 individuals through \n21 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 starting when they are 15 or 16 \nyears old in 1979 and ending when they are 40 or 41 years old in 2004. By assuming that \nindividuals\u2019 direct experiences with unions before age 15 or 16 is minimal, we construct a unique \nseries of never-unionized profiles by observing when each individual first becomes employed in \na unionized job as they age from 15\/16 to 40\/41, and then identify those who are still never \nunionized at age 40\/41. This differs from the methodology of the British and German analyses of \nnever-membership that use cross-sectional surveys that specifically asked whether the individual \nrespondent had ever been a member of a union. We instead use longitudinal data to trace each \nindividual\u2019s union-nonunion job history for the first half of their working lives. This adds a level \nof life cycle richness not available in cross-sectional measures of never-union. \n2. Theoretical background \n Underlying our analyses of never-unionization in the United States is a theoretical \nfoundation in which individual unionization outcomes are a function of opportunity and \npropensity. This opportunity-propensity model of unionization has been used in various \ninstitutional contexts (e.g., Blanden and Machin 2003). For our application, opportunity indicates \nthe extent to which unionized jobs are available to an individual in a certain geographical area \nwho possesses certain qualifications and skills. Propensity captures the extent to which an \nindividual prefers a unionized job over a nonunion one. In this way, never-unionization is \ntheorized to reflect a combination of a lack of opportunities for obtaining a unionized job and a \n 3\nlack of desire for one. This theoretical approach does not assume that all individuals intentionally \nchoose between unionized and nonunion jobs. Individuals working in areas, industries, and \noccupations with high unionization rates might have unionized jobs because their opportunities \nare high, even if their propensities are low. \n To analyze differences in never-unionization rates and examine explanatory factors, we \ntherefore focus on measures that capture varying levels of opportunity and propensity for being \nunionized. U.S. unionization rates are frequently shown to vary by gender, race, and educational \nattainment (Blanchflower 2007) so these characteristics are central to many of our analyses. \nMarital status is also explored as a measure of labour market attachment. There are also well-\ndocumented differences in union density\u2014and therefore opportunity for having a unionized \njob\u2014across industries and occupations as well as between the private and public sectors (Curme \net al. 1990). Thus, we examine the importance of measures that capture individuals\u2019 labour \nmarket and job histories across industries, occupations, and sectors. Unions are weaker and union \ndensity lower in right-to-work states (Moore 1998), so the fraction of time spent living in non-\nright-to-work states is another important variable in our analyses. Finally, attitudes toward \nunions can also be passed from parents to their children (Barling et al. 1991; Blanden and \nMachin 2003). We therefore analyze indicators for whether the individual has a parent who is a \ncollege graduate or a blue collar worker\u2014the former is expected to reduce one\u2019s propensity to be \nunionized, the latter is expected to increase it. We are unable to include other control variables \nsuch as employer size or direct measures of attitudes toward unions due to a lack of data \navailability. \n 4\n3. Data \n The data for this study are taken from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 \n(NLSY79). The NLSY79 is a nationally-representative longitudinal sample of individuals who \nwere between the ages of 14 and 22 when the survey began in 1979, and includes annual \n(between 1979 and 1994) and biennial (since 1994) surveys of these individuals (Bureau of \nLabor Statistics 2005). The NLSY79 provides information for up to five different jobs in each \nsurvey year and we used the information that was available for all jobs in creating the main \nvariables analyzed in this study. A person\u2019s status as being covered by a collective bargaining \nagreement in any one of these jobs was used as the basis for determining whether or not a person \nwas never-unionized, currently-unionized, or formerly-unionized. \n We focus exclusively on the subset of individuals who were 15 and 16 years old in 1979 \nand follow them through 21 waves of surveys until 2004 when they are 40 or 41 years old.1 We \nexclude those who were 14 or 17-22 years old in 1979 to preserve balanced cohort sizes, for \ncomparability with the NLSY97 (which will be used as a comparison group later in this paper), \nand because it is important for our study to observe individuals when they first enter the labour \nmarket.2 The NLSY79 contains 3,130 individuals who were 15 or 16 years old when the survey \nbegan in 1979. However, to confidently construct each individual\u2019s union-nonunion job profile \nhistory without missing any unionized jobs, we exclude 1,534 of these individuals because they \ndid not participate in the survey for at least one year and another 74 observations because of \nmissing information for which no value could be determined. To preserve the sample size, we \nimputed some missing values when other pieces of information could be used to confidently \nmake these imputations.3 The final sample used here therefore contains 1,522 individuals with \ncomplete data over 21 time periods. It should be noted that to accurately track individuals as they \n 5\nage, the sample is not conditioned upon employment. The data should therefore be seen as a \nsample of all potential workers of a certain age, not all employed workers.4 Lastly, because the \nNLSY79 intentionally oversamples minority and low-income individuals, all of the results \nreported here, except those from the cluster analysis, are weighted using sampling weights. \nIn the United States, union representation is more closely tied to contract coverage \n(collective bargaining agreement coverage) than union membership. And the NLSY79 only \nconsistently asks questions about contract coverage, not union membership, across all survey \nyears. We therefore focus our attention on union coverage, not union membership. Specifically, \nthe key variable of interest is whether or not an individual was ever covered by a collective \nbargaining agreement through the 21 waves of the NLSY, that is, from age 15 or 16 to age 40 or \n41. To construct this variable, each person within the sample is considered to be never-unionized \nuntil they report being covered by a collective bargaining agreement. For example, 1.85 percent \nare covered in 1979; the remaining 98.15 percent are designated as never-unionized and continue \nto be never-unionized during successive years as long as they do not report being covered on a \njob. In each wave of the survey, then, each individual is in one of three categories: never-\nunionized, currently-unionized, or formerly-unionized. This last category consists of workers \nwho were once in a unionized job, but do not report being represented by a union in the current \nsurvey year.  \nTable 1 provides summary statistics for the variables used in the analyses. The summary \nstatistics are for the pooled data, so the sample size of 31,962 is comprised of 1,522 individuals \nover 21 survey waves. These 21 waves span 26 years because the data are collected every other \nyear after 1994, and the results are weighted using sampling weights. In the weighted sample, \n49.3 percent are female and 29 percent are non-white. The other variables can change over time \n 6\nwithin each individual as they change jobs, move, and continue their education. The summary \nstatistics in Table 1 therefore show the average values in the entire pooled data set. The average \nrate of never-unionization across the data set is 57.6 percent. The average rate of 13.3 percent for \ncurrent-unionization (those in unionized jobs at the time of the particular survey wave) is slightly \nlower than the average U.S. coverage rate of 18 percent for 1979-2004 (Hirsch and Macpherson \n2007), but this is to be expected because it is a sample of younger workers. The remaining 29.2 \npercent of the observations are formerly-unionized individuals working in nonunion jobs. In the \nremainder of this paper, these data are used to estimate never-unionized rates, trends, and \ndeterminants in the U.S. labour force.   \n4. Never-unionization rates in the United States \nThe summary statistics in Table 1 are presented for the purpose of describing the data set, \nnot for providing estimates of never-unionized, currently-unionized, and formerly-unionized \nrates. Because the sample is young relative to the broader U.S. labour force, and because ages \nless than 30 are more frequent in the sample than ages between 30 and 41 due to the biennial \nadministration of the NLSY79 after 1994, it is better to consider the age-by-age unionization \nrates that can be derived from this data set. As such, Table 2 reports the never-unionized, \ncurrently-unionized, and formerly-unionized rates as the individuals in our sample age from 16 \nto 40.5 These estimates essentially control for a cohort effect because these data track the same \nset of individuals as they age. The currently-unionized rates are predictable based on what is \nalready known about unionization patterns (e.g., Bryson et al. 2005)\u2014union density starts out \nvery low but then stabilizes at age 25 at around 15 percent, and inches up toward 17 percent as \nindividuals approach age 40. We believe that the other two trends presented in Table 2\u2014the \nnever-unionized and formerly-unionized trends in columns 1 and 3\u2014are unique results. The \n 7\nnever-unionized rate starts off close to one and declines until age 40 as individuals become \nunionized for the first time. The never-unionization rate drops below 50 percent at age 26 which \nmeans that from that point forward, a majority of U.S. workers have had firsthand experience \nwith union representation at some point in their working lives.  \nTo see the trends more clearly, the unionization rates from Table 2 are plotted in Figure \n1. The never-unionized curve is essentially a Kaplan-Meier survival curve in that it shows the \nprobability that an individual \u201csurvives\u201d until a certain age before becoming unionized, similar to \nhow labour economists analyze the duration of unemployment spells (e.g., Hunt 1995). Figure 1 \nshows that the steepest decline in the never-unionization rate occurs between ages 16 and 25 \nwith an average decline of nearly five percentage points per year. After age 29, the never-\nunionization rate declines by less than one percentage point each year. The formerly-unionized \nrate similarly exhibits its fastest gains before age 25 which coincides with the age range in which \njob tenures are shortest and individuals switch jobs frequently. By age 40, the never-unionized \nrate is 35.4 percent and the formerly-unionized rate is 48.8 percent. This is a notable result\u2014\nnearly two-thirds of U.S. workers born in 1963 and 1964 were represented by a union by age 40. \nAmong these workers, the average number of unionized employment spells is 1.96; 43 percent \nhad just one unionized spell, 29 percent had two spells, 16 percent had three, and the remaining \n12 percent had four or more unionized jobs. The average unionized employment spell length is \n2.4 years, and, as expected, this average is significantly shorter for younger workers \n(specifically, 37 weeks for teenagers compared to 4.8 years for workers aged 30 and above).6\nFigure 2 shows the age\/never-unionized profiles by gender, race, and educational \nattainment. These profiles provide the unadjusted differences between the relevant categories \n(e.g., men and women). As will be shown in Tables 5 and 6, some of these unadjusted \n 8\ndifferences can be explained by other observable factors (e.g., men and women having different \nemployment rates and jobs in different industries and occupations). With that said, in panel a of \nFigure 2 the (unadjusted) never-unionized rate for men is consistently below that for women, and \nis at least 10 percentage points below after age 20. These male-female average differences are \nstatistically different from each other at conventional levels of significance across the entire \nrange of ages in Figure 2. More than half of the men have been unionized by age 24 while it \ntakes women five years longer to achieve this milestone. The differences are smaller between \nCaucasians and nonwhite individuals (panel b). While the never-unionized curve is lower for \nnonwhite individuals\u2014that is, nonwhite individuals exit from never-unionization earlier\u2014the \ndifferences are only statistically significant for a few years around age 30.  \nPanel c shows the age\/never-unionized profiles for three educational groups: those who \ndid not complete high school, those who completed high school and may or may not have \nattended some college, and those who completed at least four years of college, all as of age \n40\/41. In other words, those who are age 19, for example, are treated as college graduates in \npanel c if they ultimately graduate from college. In their teens, the different groups exhibit \nsimilar trends in never-unionization. But the gap between the high school graduates\/some college \ngroup and the other two groups widens and becomes statistically significant at age 20. By age 40, \nthere is a 12 percentage point gap between the high school graduates\/some college group and the \ncollege graduates, and a 15 percentage point gap between the high school graduates\/some college \ngroup and those who did not complete high school. Interestingly, the high school dropout and the \ncollege graduate never-unionized trajectories follow similar trends, and are never statistically \ndifferent from each other. It takes both of these groups 8 years longer than the high school \ngraduates\/some college group to reach 50 percent ever-unionized. \n 9\nThe convex trajectories of the age\/never-unionized profiles further suggest that the lack \nof data past age 40\/41 is not a significant problem. More specifically, the never-unionized curves \nin Figures 1 and 2 all exhibit a distinct exponential shape with individuals exiting from a never-\nunionized status at a decreasing rate as they approach age 40. In fact, an exponential model of \nthe form never-unionized = \u03b20+ \u03b21* \u03b22age where \u03b20, \u03b21, and \u03b22 are three parameters estimated via \nnonlinear least squares fits the data quite well\u2014the adjusted R2 value from fitting this model to \nthe data in Figure 1 is 0.996 and the p-values for all three coefficients are less than 0.001. Figure \n3 plots the never-unionized rates from Figure 1, and the predicted values up to age 65 from this \nexponential model. Some caution is warranted because of the length of the out-of-sample \nprediction, and there is a possibility that the actual never-unionized curve changes shape above \nage 40. But the fit of the statistical model and the tightness of the 95 percent confidence bands \nsuggest that this is not likely. The model predicts that by age 65, the never-unionized rate is 33 \npercent. In other words, the exponential model implies that the never-unionized rate is predicted \nto decrease by less than three percentage points from age 40 to 65. Most individuals who leave \nnever-union status during their working life, therefore, do so by the age of 40. Consequently, \nestimates of never-unionization based on data that end with individuals aged 40\/41 appear fairly \nreliable, though it is worth remembering that a small fraction of individuals are expected to exit \nnever-unionization at older ages. \n5. Who are the never-unionized? \n The \u201cnever-unionized\u201d are defined as those who are still never-unionized in the final \nwave of the survey (age 40\/41). To more fully understand the never-unionized, Table 3 presents \na summary snapshot of the demographic, labour market, and job history characteristics of the \nnever-unionized and, for comparison, the currently-unionized and formerly-unionized at age \n 10\n40\/41. The variables that are labelled as \u201cfraction of sample period\u201d indicate what fraction of the \nyears from 1979 to 2004 (the \u201csample period\u201d) the individual exhibits certain characteristics, \nsuch as being married, living in an urban area, or working in a blue-collar occupation.7 Because \nnever-unionization reflects the opportunity and propensity to have a unionized job between age \n15\/16 and 40\/41, these fraction of the sample period are more appropriate than measures that \nindicate an individual\u2019s status only at a certain age. In Table 3, the superscripted \u0394\u2019s in column 2 \nindicate which currently-unionized means are statistically different from the analogous mean for \nthe never-unionized sample using a standard t-test for the difference of two means; the \nsuperscripted \u0394\u2019s in column 3 are for tests between the never-unionized and formerly-unionized \nsamples. Alternatively, to isolate whether never-unionized workers are unique, one could test the \nmeans in column 1 against columns 2 and 3 pooled together. Doing so yields statistically \nsignificant differences at the 5 or 10 percent level for every variable except those pertaining to \nurban residency, non-right-to-work states, the service industry, and log hourly pay.  \nTurning to the numbers in Table 3, first note that compared to workers who are or were \nunionized at age 40\/41, the never-unionized are significantly more likely to be women. In fact, \n57 percent of those who have not been unionized are women, while men outnumber women in \nthe currently-unionized and formerly-unionized categories. Perhaps unsurprisingly, never-\nunionized individuals, on average, spend less of their time between age 15\/16 and 40\/41 living in \nareas and working in sectors and occupations that are traditionally associated with higher \nunionization rates: urban areas, non-right-to-work states, manufacturing industries, the public \nsector, and blue-collar occupations. Similarly, the never-unionized spend more time working in \nindustries and occupations that are less unionized\u2014especially agricultural industries and \nmanagerial occupations. Relative to formerly-unionized individuals, never-unionized individuals \n 11\nare out of the workforce for a greater fraction of time, have had fewer jobs from age 15\/16 to \n40\/41, are less likely to have a parent who had a blue-collar job, and more likely to have a \ncollege-educated parent.  \n Thus far, the statistical portrait of the never-unionized is suggestive of a homogenous \ngroup of workers who either choose or happen to live and be employed in sectors in which \nunionization is less prevalent. But previous research has found that unionized workers are \ntypically found in the middle of the skill distribution (Card 2001), and a closer inspection of the \neducational profiles of the never-unionized reveals that, relative to workers who are and were \nunionized, the never-unionized are more likely to be high school dropouts and more likely to be \ncollege graduates. This implies that never-unionized workers are diverse and consist of 1) less-\neducated workers who perhaps do not have enough education to obtain a unionized job (that is, \nthose who lack opportunities for obtaining unionized jobs), and 2) highly-educated workers in \nwhite collar, private sector jobs that rarely choose union representation (that is, those who lack \nthe propensity to find unionized jobs). The pattern of wages in the sample reinforces this diverse \nprofile. In Table 3, the average log hourly wage for never-unionized individuals is not \nstatistically different from the averages for the currently-unionized and former-unionized \nworkers, but Figure 4 shows that these means hide more than they reveal.  \n More specifically, Figure 4 presents nonparametric kernel density estimates of the log \nhourly wage distributions for the three samples of workers aged 40 and 41 years old. Consistent \nwith well-known results showing that unions reduce wage dispersion (e.g., Freeman 1980; Card \net al. 2007), the currently-unionized wage distribution is the narrowest. The formerly-unionized \ndistribution largely lies to the left of the currently-unionized distribution which is consistent with \na situation in which these workers are no longer enjoying a union wage premium. The never-\n 12\nunionized distribution, though, is the most dispersed and, consistent with unionized workers \ntypically being located in the middle of the skill distribution, has portions both to the left and \nright of the currently-unionized wage distribution. These results reinforce what the diverse \nprofile of the never-unionized suggested by the educational attainment results\u2014some of the \nnever-unionized could benefit from unionization (those in the wage distribution to the left of the \ncurrently-unionized distribution) while others (those in the wage distribution to the right of the \ncurrently-unionized distribution) are earning more than unionized workers. \n Cluster analysis provides another tool for considering the heterogeneity of the never-\nunionized. We undertook a hierarchical, agglomerative, average linkage cluster analysis of the \nnever-unionized using the following measures: female, nonwhite, years of education, and \nfraction of the sample out of the workforce and in urban areas, non-right-to-work states, \nagriculture, manufacturing, service industries, the public sector, blue-collar occupations, and \nmanagerial occupations. This procedure begins with each of the 515 never-unionized individuals \nin their own individual 515 groups and then repeatedly joins the closest groups into clusters until \nall of the clusters become a single group of the entire sample. Because this method starts with \nindividual observations and then clusters them, it is called \u201cagglomerative;\u201d because it creates a \nhierarchy of clusters by combining similar clusters into larger higher-level clusters, it is called \n\u201chierarchical.\u201d We use the commonly-used Euclidean distance measure (the sum of squared \ndifferences between the values of the relevant variables for two individuals) as the indicator of \nsimilarity or dissimilarity of two observations; the average of this measure is used to capture the \nsimilarity or dissimilarity of clusters (hence \u201caverage linking\u201d).   \n The cluster analysis results indicate that the 515 never-unionized individuals are \ncomprised of two clusters that we label Cluster A and Cluster B. Table 4 shows that Cluster B \n 13\nconsists of 7 high school dropouts who are frequently out of the workforce and who often work \nin agriculture but rarely in the public sector or managerial occupations; Cluster A consists of \neveryone else.8 The cluster analysis results further show that Cluster A consists of two subsets \nthat we label A1 and A2. The sample means reported in column 3 of Table 4 reveal that Cluster \nA1 consists of higher-educated workers who are usually employed and are significantly more \nlikely to work in managerial than blue-collar occupations. Cluster A2 includes less-educated \nworkers, on average, who are more likely to be blue-collar workers outside of the public sector. \nClusters A1 and A2 are further comprised of A1(a)\/A1(b) and A2(a)\/A2(b), respectively. \nComparing the characteristics of Cluster A1(a) with A1(b), and of A2(a) with A2(b), further \nreveal the importance of educational level and occupation. One can look at further subdivisions \nof the clusters, but the clusters reported in Table 4 capture the key results\u2014the never-unionized \nare a non-trivial segment of the American workforce that consists of two or more educationally- \nand occupationally- distinct groups. \n6. Predicting never-unionization \nTo assess the correlates of never-unionization at age 40\/41 in a multivariate framework, \nwe also estimated probit models in which the dependent variable is the indicator for never-\nunionization. Three specifications are reported in Table 5. The independent variables are the \nsame as in Table 3, except pay is excluded because of endogeneity concerns. To facilitate \ninterpretation, the entries in Table 5 report the marginal effects, not probit coefficients, \ncalculated in the conventional way (using the probit derivative for continuous variables and the \npredicted change with a variable on and off for dummy variables with all other variables \nevaluated at their sample means). The first specification (column 1) focuses on individual \ndemographic characteristics while the specifications reported in columns 2 and 3 add \n 14\nindividuals\u2019 labour market and job history information as well as parental background \ncharacteristics.  \nConsistent with the summary statistics presented in Table 3, women are significantly \nmore likely to be never-unionized when only controlling for other demographic measures. But \nthis difference disappears when accounting for each individual\u2019s labour market and job history. \nIn this way, male-female differences in never-unionization reflect differences in their labour \nmarket experiences with respect to the fraction of time spent employed and the industries and \noccupations in which men and women are commonly employed. The relationship between \neducational attainment and the probability of never-unionization, however, is robust across all \nthree specifications. Relative to those whose highest educational attainment is a high school \ndiploma, those who did not complete high school are predicted to be 17-20 percentage points less \nlikely to never be unionized at age 40\/41. Relative to the mean never-unionized rate of 0.352, \nthis implies a 50 percent reduction in the probability of never-unionization. College graduates are \n12.1 percentage points more likely, on average, to never have a unionized job by age 40\/41 \ncompared to high school graduates (column 1), and this difference is robust to accounting for \nadditional factors. No statistical differences are uncovered between high school graduates and \nthose who attended college but did not complete a four-year college degree.  \nWith respect to labour market and job histories, the strongest negative predictors of \nnever-unionization are spending more time working between age 15\/16 and 40\/41 in urban areas, \nnon-right-to-work states, manufacturing or service industries, the public sector, and blue-collar \njobs.9 Individuals spending more time working in agriculture or in managerial occupations are, \non average, significantly more likely to be never-unionized. These findings are consistent with \nthe well-known pattern of U.S. union density rates across industries, occupations and sectors. \n 15\nParental education and blue-collar status do not predict never-unionization status, either because \nparental attitudes toward unionization do not affect never-unionization, or because these \nmeasures are inadequate proxies for these attitudes (column 3).  \n The probit results in Table 5 are one way to estimate the important correlates of never-\nunionization at age 40\/41. An alternative approach is to use the full time-span of the data and to \ntreat exiting from never-unionization as a duration issue analogous to duration models that \nanalyze how long it takes someone to exit from unemployment (Anderson 1992) or how long \nsomeone stays in a job (Booth et al. 1999). Specifically, consider how the probability of exiting \nfrom never-unionization varies as individuals get older over time. Generically, this can be \ncaptured by a hazard function h(t) that measures the probability of exit at time t. To analyze \nwhether exiting from never-unionization is systematically linked to some explanatory variables, \nthis hazard function can be modelled econometrically as a function of these variables. A popular \nmethod for doing this is the Cox proportional hazards model in which the independent variables \nproportionally shift an unspecified baseline hazard.10\n Table 6 therefore presents the results of a Cox proportional hazard model estimated on \nthe full data set from 1979 to 2004. Relative to the probit models, the proportional hazard \nestimation method incorporates incomplete or censored spells which is potentially important here \nbecause some individuals will exit never-unionization after our data end. A drawback, however, \nis that the interpretation of the hazard parameters is not as intuitive as that for the probit marginal \neffects. The parameter estimates allow us to determine the effect of the independent variables on \nthe conditional probability of one becoming ever-unionized from a never-unionized state in the \nnext time period. To facilitate this interpretation, we report the hazard ratios (the exponentiated \ncoefficients \u03b2) rather than the coefficients in Table 6. Hazard ratios above one indicate that \n 16\nincreases in the relevant independent variable are associated with an increased likelihood of \nexiting from never-unionized status in the next time period; ratios below one indicate that \nincreases in the relevant independent variable are predicted, on average, to reduce the probability \nthat an individual exits from the initial never-unionized state. \n Turning to the estimates in Table 6, the female and married coefficients are not \nstatistically significant. As such, one cannot reject the null hypothesis that men and women, or \nsingle and married individuals, face equal probabilities of exiting from never-unionization. The \nindicators for nonwhite, high school dropout, and college graduate, in contrast, are statistically \nsignificant at the 5 percent level of significance. The nonwhite coefficient is greater than one so \nnonwhite individuals are predicted to have higher relative probabilities of leaving never-\nunionization than white individuals. While this variable was not statistically significant in the \nprobit analyses in Table 5, the significant estimate in the duration model is consistent with other \nresearch that shows both Hispanics and African-Americans are more likely to be unionized than \nwhites in the United States (Blanchflower 2007). The education coefficients are less than one so \nrelative to individuals with only a high school diploma (i.e., those who did not go onto college), \nthose who did not complete high school and those who graduated from college are significantly \nless likely to exit from never-unionization. Specifically, the estimated hazard ratio of 0.731 for \nthe high school dropout variable implies that if we consider a high school dropout and a high \nschool graduate who each have not exited from never-unionization by a certain age, then the high \nschool dropout is only 0.731 times as likely to exit by the time they are one year older. Put \nslightly differently, between a high school dropout and a high school graduate who are still \nnever-unionized, the high school dropout is 42 percent less likely to stop being never-unionized \n 17\nfirst.11 The estimated hazard ratio for the college graduate variable implies that college graduates \nare 40 percent less likely than high school graduates to become unionized first.   \n With respect to the labour market and job history characteristics, most of the findings are \nsimilar to those in the probit analyses. Individuals living in urban areas and non-right-to-work \nstates and those working in manufacturing, the public sector, or blue-collar occupations are \nsignificantly more likely to exit from never-unionized to ever-unionized than the relevant \ncomparison individuals (e.g., non-urban workers for urban workers, or industries besides \nagriculture, manufacturing, and services for the industry variables). Individuals with managerial \noccupations, in contrast, are significantly less likely to exit from their initial never-unionized \nstatus. Unlike in the probit results, the estimate for total jobs held in the Cox proportional hazard \nmodel is statistically significant at the 10 percent level. The hazard ratio above one seems logical \ngiven that more job mobility presumably gives one more opportunities to experience a unionized \njob from a purely probabilistic perspective.  \nThe local unemployment rate has no significant effects on the probability of exiting \nnever-unionized status, but the statistically significant estimates for the two hours variables \nindicate that average hours of work has a quadratic relationship with the probability of exiting \nfrom never-unionization.12 Higher hours worked are associated with an increased probability of \nexit, but given the squared term, this effect is largest at around 34.6 hours per week.  \n7. Has U.S. never-unionization increased? \nOne of the central results of Bryson and Gomez (2005) is that British rates of never-\nmembership have significantly increased since the 1980s. As noted in the introduction, this is a \nparticularly important trend if unionism is an experience good. As shown in Table 2 and Figure \n1, the never-unionization trend in the NLSY79 data is downward sloping, but this trend is for one \n 18\ncohort of individuals as they grow older. To see if never-unionization rates are increasing akin to \nthe Bryson and Gomez (2005) results for never-membership in Britain, we need to compare the \nNLSY79 trend with another cohort of workers. For this we turn to the National Longitudinal \nSurvey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2005). The design and \nadministration of the NLSY97 is very similar to that of the NLSY79. It begins with a survey of \n12-16 year olds in 1997 and continues with annual survey waves of these same individuals. We \ntherefore repeated the construction of a never-unionized data set tracking individuals who were \n15 and 16 years old in 1997 just as we started with 15 and 16 year olds in the NLSY79 in 1979 \nfor our primary sample.  \nThe first eight waves of the NLSY97 up through 2004 allow us to track individuals up to \nage 22\/23. We therefore do not have a comparison data series that spans 26 years like the \nNLSY79, but we can compare the first eight years of the NLSY79 with the first eight years of \nthe NLSY97 to see if any changes in the never-unionization trajectory are apparent. Figure 5 \ntherefore presents the never-unionized profiles for ages 16 to 23 for the NLSY79 (solid line) and \nthe similarly-aged cohort from the NLSY97 (dashed line) that follows 18 years later. At ages \ngreater than 17 years old, the mean never-unionization rates are statistically different for the two \ncohorts at conventional levels of significance with the more recent NLSY97 never-unionized \nrates significantly higher than those in the earlier NLSY79 cohort. By the oldest available age, \nthe gap is 12.5 percentage points. In other words, by age 23 circa the mid 1980s, 58.1 percent of \nindividuals had never been unionized, but roughly 20 years later, 70.6 percent of twenty-three \nyear olds had never been unionized.   \n One complication, however, is that the demographic composition of the labour force and \nstructural composition of the economy are different in these two eras. For example, among 22\/23 \n 19\nyear olds in the eighth wave of the NLSY79 in 1986, 16 percent had completed four years of \ncollege and 36 percent had held a manufacturing job. In contrast, among 22\/23 year olds in the \neighth wave of the NLSY97 in 2004, 28 percent had completed four years of college and 27 \npercent had held a manufacturing job. It is important to see if the rate of never-unionization has \nincreased after adjusting for these shifting demographic and structural characteristics. As such, \nwe construct counterfactuals for the NLSY97 that estimate the NLSY97 rates of never-\nunionization that would have occurred if the NLSY97 had the same demographic and structural \ncomposition as in the NLSY79.  \n These counterfactuals are constructed by re-weighting the NLSY97 observations to \nsimulate the distribution of demographic and structural characteristics in the NLSY79 data. For \nexample, consider manufacturing. In the eighth wave of the NLSY97, 9 percent of the \nindividuals are working in manufacturing whereas in the eighth wave of the earlier NLSY79, the \nanalogous fraction is 19 percent. The earlier distribution can be replicated in the NLSY97 sample \nby increasing the weight of each NLSY97 individual working in manufacturing and decreasing \nthe weight of those outside of manufacturing to simulate a sample with 19 percent in \nmanufacturing. By using the methodology of DiNardo et al. (1996), this logic can be extended to \ngender, race, occupation, education, and other factors by re-weighting each observation by its \nrelative probability of being in the NLSY79 compared to the NLSY97. These relative \nprobabilities are calculated from a logit model where the dependent variable indicates that the \nobservation is from the NSLY79 and the independent variables are years of education and \nindicators for female, nonwhite, urban, right-to-work state, public sector, employed, and major \n(1-digit) industry and occupation.  \n 20\n The dotted line in Figure 5 shows the counterfactual never-unionized trajectory produced \nby this re-weighting algorithm. Accounting for demographic and structural changes between the \nNLSY79 and NLSY97 cohorts does indeed bring the two trajectories closer together. In other \nwords, 35-40 percent of the increase from the era of the NLSY79 to the era of the NLSY97 in the \nnever-unionization rate can be explained by demographic and structural shifts.13 But these shifts \ndo not account for the entire change as after age 17 the mean never-unionized rates for the \ncounterfactual and the NLSY79 trends are statistically different with p-values generally less than \n0.01. It does indeed appear that never-unionization rates in the United States are increasing as \nnew cohorts enter the labour market, even after adjusting for demographic and structural \nchanges.  \n8. Conclusions \n By assembling a unique data set that tracks U.S. individuals through 21 waves of the \nNLSY79 from age 15\/16 in 1979 to age 40\/41 in 2004, we have extended the concept of never-\nmembership to the issue of never-unionization, and uncovered the significance of never-\nunionization in the U.S. employment relationship. The never-unionization trends documented \nhere reveal both opportunities and risks for U.S. labour unions. The opportunities come from the \nfact that by age 40\/41, nearly two-thirds of U.S. workers in our specific cohort had experienced \nunionization firsthand, including those who are currently-unionized at age 40\/41. U.S. labour \nunions therefore represent (at some point) many more workers than the 15 percent or so who are \nunionized at any given time. This provides an opportunity for unions to develop greater support \namong a larger segment of the U.S. labour force by making sure that workers have positive \nexperiences when they are represented, even as teenagers working at their first job in a grocery \nstore. This can potentially translate into more workers choosing to remain unionized and into \n 21\ngreater socio-political support among the formerly-unionized. But the trends revealed in our \nanalyses also contain risks for U.S. labour unions. If the half of the middle-aged labour force that \nis formerly-unionized had negative firsthand experiences with labour unions, then broad socio-\npolitical support for unions will be harder to generate. \nThe experience good model of unionism (Bryson and Gomez 2003; Gomez and \nGunderson 2004) also presents the U.S. labour movement with a good news\/bad news scenario. \nTo the extent that unionism is an experience good, workers can only fully appreciate the benefits \nof unionization by experiencing it firsthand. The good news for the labour movement in our \nresults is that two-thirds of U.S. workers who are 40\/41 years old in 2004 had direct experience \nwith union representation. The bad news for the U.S. labour movement is that never-unionization \nrates appear to be increasing for more recent cohorts so the opportunity for workers to \nexperience unionization firsthand is likely declining. If there is an experience good element to \nunionization, increased levels of never-unionization can create a self-reinforcing downward \nspiral of union density and can perhaps help explain why U.S. union density continues to decline. \n The results here are also important for research. The distinct clusters revealed by cluster \nanalysis and the wide never-unionized wage distribution shown by the kernel density estimation \nsuggest that workers are never-unionized for different reasons. While we lack direct information \non this issue, the patterns we uncover are consistent with less-educated, lower-wage workers \nnever being unionized because of a lack of opportunities for obtaining better-paying unionized \njobs, and with more-educated, higher-wage workers never being unionized because of a lack of \npropensity for finding unionized jobs.14 Such possibilities are important for a deeper \nunderstanding of never-unionization as well as for the large literature on why workers join \nunions. Further analyses of these issues with finer data would therefore be a profitable subject for \n 22\nfuture research. \nResearch on the composition of union members also tends to draw one\u2019s attention to the \nlargest group of union members who are 40-50 years old (Blanchflower 2007). Our results using \nlongitudinal data suggest a more nuanced reality in which workers\u2019 initial experiences with \nunionization occur before they are 40 years old. U.S. unions, in fact, seem to get very few \nworkers to experience unionism for the first time in their forties, and the convex never-\nunionization trajectory suggests that the chances are very high that a never-unionized individual \nin their forties will continue to be never-unionized until they retire. We need to guard against \nthinking of unionism as a middle-age phenomenon even if this is the age at which workers are \nthe most likely to be unionized.  \nBryson and Gomez (2003; 73) also assert that a \u201ckey feature of unionization\u201d is that \n\u201cincreasing the flow of members into unions is far more difficult than maintaining the existing \nstock.\u201d This proposition was derived from studying membership rates in British unions, and our \nresults here suggest that this is not a key feature of union coverage in the United States. As \nshown in Figure 1, as U.S. employees mature from their teens to their early forties, the stock of \nunionized workers remains fairly stable, but once workers reach age 20, more of them are \nformerly-unionized than currently-unionized, and by age 40\/41, nearly half of the labour force is \nformerly-unionized. This single largest segment of the workforce represents a large group of \nworkers that unions were unable to maintain in their ranks. More research is needed on the \ndynamics of flows in and out of unions as workers age across the life cycle. \n 23\n \nNotes\n \n \n1 Because of different survey months across the waves of the NLSY79, not everyone ages one \nyear in the reported data. We recode everyone to age one year for each survey year based on the \nage in the initial 1979 survey wave. \n2 The key concern is that we cannot accurately determine if an individual was ever unionized or \ncovered by a collective bargaining agreement if they had any unionized jobs that occurred before \nthey were first surveyed in 1979. We think this is severest for those older than 16 in 1979 as the \nunionization rate among 14 and 15 year olds is a mere half-percent so missed occurrences of \nunionized jobs for these individuals is likely to be rare. In comparison, the unionization rate for \n17 and 18 year olds is 5-10 percent so the chance of missing pre-survey union jobs for the older \nage cohorts is significantly higher. We therefore focus on individuals younger than 17 at the start \nof the survey. By this logic, we could have included 14 year olds, but this cohort is significantly \nsmaller than the others and it is therefore excluded to maintain balanced cohort sizes for the \nanalyses and for comparability with the cohort sizes in the NLSY97.  \n3 In particular, a survey error caused 621 of the employed individuals in our final sample to not \nbe asked whether or not they were covered on the job by a collective bargaining agreement in the \n1994 wave. We imputed values to this key question by selectively utilizing other variables. \nEighty-nine were self-employed and were therefore coded as not covered; 487 were matched by \nemployer id to the same job in the previous or subsequent year in which case we used the \ncovered value from the matching survey year; 26 were similarly matched by industry and \noccupation codes; and 19 were coded as not covered because of job tenures of a month or less.  \n 24\n  \n4 Among the 1,522 individuals, 10 did not report any employment in any of the 21 waves, 28 \nwere employed in 1-5 of the waves, 87 in 6-10 of the waves, 220 in 11-15 of the waves, 941 in \n16-20 of the waves, and 236 in all 21 waves. \n5 Ages 15 and 41 are excluded from Table 2 and Figure 1 because only half of the sample is \nobserved for these two ages. Moreover, because the NLSY79 is administered biennially after \n1994, we only observe half of the sample for each age from age 31 to 40. The numbers in Table \n2 and Figure 1 are therefore smoothed by interpolating the missing values as the average of the \nprevious and subsequent values within each age cohort. \n6 These figures include all spells, including 199 right-censored spells from individuals who were \nin unionized jobs still in progress in 2004.  \n7 In other words, these variables are essentially the within-individual means of annual dummy \nvariables for each of these categories. Recall, however, that the NLSY79 is administered \nbiennially rather than annually after 1994. The strict mean of the survey waves, therefore, \nunderweights later ages. To compensate, we multiply each value in each survey wave after 1994 \nby two and then re-normalize the average to reflect a sample period of 26 years rather than 21 \nsurvey administrations. Note further that individuals can have multiple jobs in one period. The \nmeasures in Table 3 are generally for their primary job. The results are qualitatively similar if we \nuse indicators for whether an individual was ever married, in a non-right-to-work state, blue-\ncollar occupation, and the like. \n8 The superscripted \u0394\u2019s in Table 4 denote that the sample means are statistically different from \neach other in a pairwise t-test within these relevant comparisons (e.g., A versus B, or A1 versus \nA2). \n 25\n  \n9 The results are similar if we use indicators for ever living in a non-right-to-work state, \nmanufacturing, a blue-collar occupation, and other analogous measures to those reported in \nTable 5. \n10 The Cox proportional hazards model assumes the following functional form of the hazard \nfunction: h(t) = h0(t)\u00b7ex\u03b2 where h0(t) is an unspecified baseline hazard, x denotes the independent \nvariables, and \u03b2 represents the parameters to be estimated. The baseline hazard is not estimated. \nIt can be any shape, but it is assumed to be the same for all individuals. The parameters \u03b2 \nindicate how much the independent variables shift this baseline hazard. For example, the \nestimate for the coefficient on a female dummy variable indicates the extent to which the hazard \nfunction differs between men and women. For more details, see Kalbfleisch and Prentice (2002). \n11 Because the hazard ratio HR = 1\/(1-p) where p is the probability of exiting first, then p = \nHR\/(1+HR) (Spruance et al. 2004). \n12 These three variables in the Cox proportional hazard model were not included in the probit \nmodel because the probit model focuses on summarizing 25 years of labour market and job \nhistory rather than period-specific characteristics. \n13 Using linear probability models to calculate a Oaxaca-type decomposition in which the change \nin never-unionization at age 23 between the two cohorts is decomposed into the portion \nattributed to changing characteristics and the portion attributed to changing coefficients or \npropensities indicates that 19 percent of the change can be explained by changing characteristics. \nThis reinforces the finding that changing demographic and structural changes can explain only a \nfraction of the total change. \n 26\n \n14 Consistent with this conjecture, in the U.S. Worker Representation and Participation Survey \nconducted by Freeman and Rogers (1999), the percentage of nonunion workers who reported that \nthey would vote in favour of union representation in their workplace was 51 percent for high \nschool dropouts compared to only 23 percent for college graduates (authors\u2019 calculations from \ndata available at http:\/\/www.nber.org\/~freeman\/wrps.html). \n 27\n References \nAnderson, Patricia M.
