This\ncondition was first described in the dialysis population\n[1] and contrary to its name, is not exclusive to uraemic\npatients but may occur in nonuraemic conditions such as\nprimary hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, alcoholic liver\ndisease, connective tissue disease, diabetes mellitus,\nCrohn's disease and corticosteroid use [2]. CUA has a slow\nand indolent onset that classically presents in the distal\nlower limbs. However, it may occur in any part of the\nbody, including visceral tissue [3,4]. In general, systemic\ncalciphylaxis has a poor prognosis and is often fatal. The\npathogenesis of this disease is not well understood but\nmay involve abnormal calcium phosphate homeostasis.\nThere are also several recognized risk factors associated\nwith the development of CUA, such as hyperparathy-\nroidism, elevated calcium-phosphate product (multiply-\nPublished: 24 November 2009\nJournal of Medical Case Reports 2009, 3:9297 doi:10.1186\/1752-1947-3-9297\nReceived: 22 January 2009\nAccepted: 24 November 2009\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.jmedicalcasereports.com\/content\/3\/1\/9297\n\u00a9 2009 Hanvesakul et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 3\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJournal of Medical Case Reports 2009, 3:9297 http:\/\/www.jmedicalcasereports.com\/content\/3\/1\/9297ing serum calcium and phosphate values [normal range\nless than 4.5]), diabetes mellitus, obesity, coagulopathies,\nwarfarin or iron dextran treatment.\nThere have been a few reported cases of CUA occurring in\npatients late after kidney transplantation [4-6]. We\ndescribe an unusual case of rapid onset CUA with super-\nimposed infection in a patient six months after kidney\ntransplantation but with normal serum calcium levels\ndespite having had a total parathyroidectomy.\nCase presentation\nA 70-year-old British Caucasian man with end stage renal\nfailure (ESRF) secondary to IgA nephropathy received a\ndeceased donor kidney transplant on the 14th January\n2008. He had been diagnosed with ESRF 15 years previ-\nously, and was initially dialysing via peritoneal dialysis\nand later via haemodialysis. At the time of transplant, his\nonly remaining vascular access was a long-term intrave-\nnous catheter. Many years previously he had undergone a\ntotal parathyroidectomy for tertiary hyperparathyroidism\nand therefore took regular calcium supplements and alfa-\ncalcidol at a dose of 0.25 \u03bcg\/day. Both pre- and post-kid-\nney transplant parathyroid hormone (PTH) and serum\ncalcium levels were within normal ranges with a calcium-\nphosphate product of less than 4. Post-transplant recovery\nwas complicated by delayed graft function requiring dial-\nysis for 14 days, transplant wound dehiscence requiring\nV.A.C.\u00ae dressing, and bladder outflow obstruction requir-\ning intermittent self-catheterization. Despite these com-\nplications, he continued to improve with a good urine\noutput and a glomerular filtration rate of 38.9 ml\/min\nand was discharged home.\nDuring routine follow-up at the outpatient clinic, the\npatient's calcium supplements were modified. He was\nadmitted four months later with a complaint of sudden\nonset of painless lesions bilaterally on the medial aspect\nof his thighs. They appeared within the 48 hours prior to\nadmission and were not associated with a history of\ntrauma. Serum levels of calcium, phosphate, PTH and cal-\ncium-phosphate product were found to be normal. Clini-\ncally, both lesions were well demarcated, gangrenous in\nappearance and foul smelling (Figure 1). Peripheral\npulses were intact. Swabs taken from this lesion grew Pseu-\ndomonas and coliforms sensitive to meropenem. A wedge\nbiopsy of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of calciphy-\nlaxis (Figure 2). Intravenous antibiotic was immediately\nintroduced and all calcium supplements were stopped.\nOver a period of one month, the lesions had fully\nresolved.\nConclusion\nWe describe an unusual presentation of proximal lower\nlimb calciphylaxis with superimposed infection. Interest-\ningly, this patient did not have any of the recognized risk\nfactors associated with the development of CUA. The clin-\nical outcome in this case has been favorable and empha-\nsizes the importance of early diagnosis, aggressive\nantimicrobial therapy and wound management. CUA\nmay present as mild erythematous patches, livido reticu-\nlaris, painful nodules or necrotic ulcerating lesions, giving\nvarious possible differential diagnoses. Gold standard\ntreatment for CUA includes diagnostic biopsy to refute\nother causes of cutaneous lesions, treatment of hyperpar-\nathyroidism, reduction of calcium-phosphate product,\nanti-microbial therapy and meticulous wound care. Sev-\neral therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CUA have\nbeen tested including parathyroidectomy, hyperbaric oxy-\ngen therapy, sodium thiosulfate infusion, tissue plas-\nminogen activator and bisphosphonates but none have\nshown any consistent benefit [7].
