MARCHANT ET AL.\nand breaking of cell-cell and cell-ECM contacts and the degradation of ECM components which other-\nwise obstruct tumour cell migration and invasion. The large body of experimental work devoted to elu-\ncidating the mechanisms by which tumours invade underlines its importance in cancer biology. Much of\nthis work is embodied in the three step hypothesis (Stetler-Stevenson et al. (1993)) which characterises\na cell\u2019s invasive potential on the basis of three inter-related phenomena: adhesion, local proteolysis and\nmigration. A cell\u2019s adhesive properties are controlled by the number and type of adhesion molecules on\nits outer membrane. Normal cells have large numbers of homotypic adhesion molecules which cause\nthe cells to stick to each other. These homotypic bonds are weaker for malignant cells and instead\nthere are stronger heterotypic bonds between the cells and the ECM. Malignant cells that are attached\nto the ECM can produce enzymes called proteases that degrade components of the ECM in a process\nknown as proteolysis. Having degraded the local ECM the cell may then migrate into the vacant space.\nThe mechanisms by which tumour cells migrate may be divided into three main types: chemokinesis\ndescribes random motion in response to a chemical stimulant; chemotaxis describes directed motion\nin response to concentration gradients of soluble factors; and haptotaxis describes directed motion in\nresponse to concentration gradients of bound, insoluble and non-diffusible chemicals present within the\nECM. Haptotaxis is assumed to be the dominant migration mechanism within the model described in\nthis paper. We note that chemotaxis has a similar mathematical representation and therefore our results\nshould extend easily to models of chemotactic motion.\nWhile the molecular mechanisms that underpin tumour invasion remain to be characterised fully, it\nis generally accepted that those associated with cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion are crucial (Cairns et\nal. (2003)). For example, adhesion molecules such as integrins and cadherins enable cells to sense and\ninteract with their environment. The expression of these molecules and, hence, tumour cell adhesion and\nmotility are known to be influenced by a variety of factors that are overexpressed in tumours such as liver,\nbreast and colon. These include the plasminogen activation system which, through the urokinase-type\nplasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor (uPAR), not only promotes ECM proteolysis by regulating\nplasminogen activation but also regulates cell-ECM interactions by acting as an adhesion receptor for\nvitronectin, an ECM component, and by modulating integrin function. In addition, uPA\/uPAR regulates\ncell migration by acting as a signal transduction molecule and through its intrinsic chemotactic activity\n(Sidenius & Blasi (2003)).\nLike the plasminogen system, the metalloproteases and their inhibitors perform a variety of roles in\ntumour invasion: through ECM degradation they enable cells to move through tissues; through prote-\nolytic cleavage they release growth factors, making them available to cells at a distance; and, by reg-\nulating receptor cleavage, they help to terminate migratory signalling (Chang & Werb (2001)). There\nare two closely related metalloprotease families: matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and metalloprotease-\ndisintegrins (ADAMs). MMPs are characterised by their ability to degrade the ECM and their depen-\ndence on zin binding for proteolytic activity. ADAMs are transmembrane proteins that contain disinte-\ngrin and metalloprotease domains. Their activity tends to focus on tumour cell adhesion and regulating\ngrowth signalling. Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs) are a family of secreted proteins that\nselectively, but reversibly, inhibit metalloproteases.\nRegional variations in the rate of tumour invasion have been observed in vivo. For example, prostatic\nmalignancies often travel to the axial skeleton rather than invade locally (Bailey & Love (1995)). These\nvariations are thought to be due to variations in the composition of the ECM (Aznavoorian et al. (1990)\nand Liotta (1986)). In order to test this hypothesis in vitro, Perumpanani & Byrne (1999) performed a\nseries of invasion assays in which the density of the gel into which the tumour cells invaded was the key\nparameter. In more detail, HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells were added to prepared collagen gels of\ndifferent (but uniform) concentrations. HT1080 cells were used because they are known to respond to\nBiphasic behaviour in malignant invasion 3 of 26\nCollagen Concentration (mg\/ml)\nIn\nva\nsi\no\nn\n D\nis\nta\nn\nce\n (m\nm\n)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n0.94 1.87 3.75 7.5\nFIG. 1.

In the experiments, no external gradients were imposed so any motion was due either to random\nmotion or haptotaxis, the relevant growth factors being expressed by the HT1080 cells themselves.\nWhen the invasiveness of the cells was measured, a biphasic relationship between the speed of the\ninvading front and the concentration of the collagen gel was observed (see Figure 1). For small col-\nlagen concentrations the rate of invasion increased with the collagen concentration until it reached a\nmaximum level. Thereafter the speed of invasion decreased with increasing collagen gel concentration.\nPerumpanani & Byrne (1999) postulated that the biphasic relationship was due to interactions between\ncell proliferation and migration and developed a mathematical model to test this hypothesis. In addition\nto reproducing the observed biphasic behaviour, numerical simulations obtained from the mathemat-\nical model suggested that there was a biphasic relationship between collagen concentration and cell\nproliferation, a prediction that was then confirmed experimentally (see Figure 2).\nAs stated above, the model of tumour invasion presented by Perumpanani & Byrne (1999) is based\nupon the three-step hypothesis. Other, complementary models have been developed to study the impact\non invasion of other factors, including local pH levels (Gatenby & Gawlinski (1996)), the mechanical\nproperties of the gel or tissue in which the tumour is invading (Chen et al. (2001)), and differential\nproliferation rates of normal and cancer cells (Sherratt & Nowak (1992)). By adapting a technique\nused previously to study angiogenesis, Anderson et al. (2000) developed a discrete model of tumour\ninvasion and compared the results of model simulations with those from an equivalent, continuous and\ndeterministic model. More recently Anderson (2005) has extended this discrete modelling approach\nby developing a hybrid mathematical model to study the impact of tumour cell heterogeneity on the\ninvasion of vascular tumours (the model is termed hybrid since it combines continuous and discrete\nvariables).\nA weakness of many invasion models is that they are not amenable to analysis and must be solved\nusing numerical methods. In consequence it is often difficult to assess the relative importance of the\nvarious mechanisms present in a model and how they interact. By contrast, Pettet et al. (2000) and\nothers (Landman et al. (2003), Marchant et al. (2000) and Perumpanani et al. (1996)) have developed\nsimple models for cell migration that are amenable to analysis in which chemotaxis is the dominant\nmechanism of cell migration. In particular, using non-standard phase place techniques, Marchant et al.\n4 of 26 B.P.

Dose response curves for HT1080 proliferation are shown for\nvarious concentrations of Type I collagen. Proliferation is measured in Reference Fluorescence Units (RFUs).\n(2000) have demonstrated that such models may admit stable travelling shock wave solutions, in which\nthe invading tumour profile and retreating collagen profiles are of fixed shape and move at a constant\nspeed. The (stable) solutions are further characterised by a discontinuity, or blunt interface, at the front\nof the tumour wave, ahead of which the tumour concentration is zero (for a typical profile, see Figure\n11) and, as such, may be deemed more physically realistic than the smooth-fronted solutions that arise\nwhen linear diffusive phenomena dominate cell migration (see, for example, the models developed by\nAnderson et al. (2000), Gatenby & Gawlinski (1996) and Sherratt & Nowak (1992)).\nIn view of the above observations, in this paper we develop a simple model of malignant invasion\nthat retains the key features of the model presented by Perumpanani & Byrne (1999) and, in particu-\nlar, the biphasic dependence of the invasion speed on the density of the surrounding collagen gel but\nneglects random motion and diffusive effects. In this respect the model is similar in form to that anal-\nysed by Marchant et al. (2000). However an additional term is included here to represent the effect of\ncompetition for space between the collagen gel and the malignant cells. It is this term that ensures our\nmodel reproduces the biphasic behaviour observed in Perumpanani and Byrne\u2019s more complex model.\nImportantly, the model is also amenable to analysis using techniques similar to those developed by Pet-\ntet et al. (2000), Marchant et al. (2000) and Landman et al. (2003). Thus, we analyse our model within\nthe framework of a nonstandard two-dimensional phase plane in which solutions may develop shocks\nor jump discontinuities. Discontinuous solutions may be constructed by connecting trajectories that\npass through specific points on a singular curve in phase space and recross it via a shock when they\nintersect another, well-defined curve, termed the jump curve. When competition for space is omitted\nwe recover the model developed by Marchant et al. (2000). In this case for each set of parameter values\na unique, blunt interface travelling wave solution exists and therefore there is a monotonic relationship\nbetween the density of the surrounding collagen gel and the invasion speed. In this paper we show that\nthe biphasic behaviour exhibited by our model is due to the inclusion of competition for space between\nthe collagen gel and the malignant cells and may be explained using nonstandard phase plane analysis.\nFor certain parameter values, it is possible to show that the competition mechanism leads to the exis-\ntence of two distinct points at which trajectories may cross the singular curve and, hence, two distinct,\ndiscontinuous travelling wave solutions which lead directly to the biphasic behaviour.\nBiphasic behaviour in malignant invasion 5 of 26\nWorking with a different model, Landman et al. (2003) have already recorded the possible existence\nof multiple points at which trajectories may cross the singular curve. However, to the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first time that the appearance of multiple points of this kind have been linked\nwith nonuniqueness of travelling shock wave solutions. It is noteworthy that these shock solutions can\nbe robustly stable (i.e. they persist as solutions of the full system of partial differential equations) and,\nhence, that they may describe what happens in vivo.\nThe remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we present our model of malignant\ninvasion. Travelling shock wave solutions of our model are described in Section 3. Solutions of the\nmodel with and without competition for space between the connective tissue and the malignant cells are\ncompared within a singular phase plane. This leads to a mathematical explanation of how competition\nfor space results in a biphasic relationship between the farfield collagen concentration and the speed of\ninvasion. Finally our conclusions are presented in Section 4.\n2. Model Derivation\nIn this section we present our model of malignant invasion. As we explain below, it captures features\nof two existing models of invasion studied in Perumpanani et al. (1996) and Perumpanani & Byrne\n(1999). For simplicity, we consider a one-dimensional Cartesian geometry. Denoting time and position\nby t and x and assuming that invasion takes place in the x-direction, we formulate our model in terms\nof three key dependent variables: u(x,t), the concentration of tumour cells; c(x,t), the concentration of\nconnective tissue (which is formed of extracellular matrix elements); and p(x,t), the concentration of a\nmatrix-degrading protease that is produced by the tumour cells to facilitate their invasion.\nThe dominant mechanisms governing the evolution of the malignant cells are assumed to be pro-\nliferation and haptotaxis up spatial gradients of connective tissue. Following Perumpanani & Byrne\n(1999), we assume that in the absence of connective tissue the cancer cells undergo logistic growth,\nwith growth rate r and carrying capacity U0. The presence of extracellular matrix (ECM) leads to com-\npetition for space and a consequent reduction in the cancer cells\u2019 net proliferation rate. We model this\neffect by including a death term which is proportional to the product uc, with constant of proportionality\nk. Combining these ideas and denoting by \u03c7 the assumed constant haptotaxis coefficient, we deduce\nthat\n\u2202u\n\u2202 t = ru\n(\n1\u2212 u\nU0\n)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nlogistic growth\n\u2212 kuc\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\ncompetition\nfor space\n\u2212\u03c7 \u2202\u2202x\n(\nu\n\u2202c\n\u2202x\n)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nhaptotaxis\n. (2.1)\nWe assume that, over the timescale of interest, ECM turnover may be neglected and that its evolu-\ntion is dominated by protease degradation which takes place at a rate proportional to the product cp.\nDenoting by \u03b1 the constant of proportionality, we deduce that\n\u2202c\n\u2202 t =\u2212\u03b1cp. (2.2)\nFinally, we assume that the invasive cells produce protease on contact with the ECM at a rate which\nis proportional to the product uc. The protease also undergoes natural decay. Combining these features\nwe deduce that\n\u2202 p\n\u2202 t = \u03b2 uc\u2212 \u03b3 p. (2.3)\n6 of 26 B.P. MARCHANT ET AL.\nIn (2.3) the non-negative constants \u03b2 and \u03b3 represent respectively the rate at which tumour cells produce\nprotease and the natural decay rate of the protease.\nBefore introducing boundary and initial conditions that close equations (2.1)-(2.3), it is convenient to\nnondimensionalise our model equations and, thereby, derive the simplified model of malignant invasion\nthat forms the basis for the analysis contained in this paper. We note that the major results of this work\ndo not depend on many of the precise forms adopted above (for instance, the degradation term appearing\nin equation (2.2) could be replaced by the more general term cpn for n an index near to 1); however, we\nuse the above explicit forms to simplify the following presentation and to compute particular examples\nof solutions.\nWe denote by tildes dimensionless quantities and scale the independent and dependent variables as\nfollows:\nt = T t\u02dc, x = Lx\u02dc, u =U0u\u02dc, c =C0c\u02dc, p = P0 p\u02dc,\nwith\nT = r\u22121, L2 = \u03c7TC0, C0 =\n\u03b3P0\n\u03b2U0 , P0 =\n1\n\u03b1T\n.\nUnder this transformation equations (2.1)-(2.3) become\n\u2202 u\u02dc\n\u2202 t\u02dc = u\u02dc(1\u2212 u\u02dc\u2212\n\u02dckc\u02dc)\u2212 \u2202\u2202 x\u02dc\n(\nu\u02dc\n\u2202 c\u02dc\n\u2202 x\u02dc\n)\n, (2.4)\n\u2202 c\u02dc\n\u2202 t\u02dc =\u2212c\u02dc p\u02dc, (2.5)\n\u2202 p\u02dc\n\u2202 t\u02dc =\n1\n\u03b5\n(u\u02dcc\u02dc\u2212 p\u02dc), (2.6)\nwhere\n\u02dck = kC0\nr\n, \u02dcD =\nDT\nL2\n, \u03b5 =\n1\n\u03b3T .\nWe remark that t is scaled so that u grows on an O(1) timescale, x is scaled so that the space and\ntime scales for haptotaxis are also O(1), p is scaled so that c is degraded on the same timescale and,\nfinally, c is scaled so that the dimensionless rates of protease production and decay in equation (2.6) are\nidentical.\nIn equation (2.6), the constant \u03b5 relates the timescale associated with the protease dynamics to that of\nthe tumour cell dynamics. Following Perumpanani et al. (1996) we exploit the small size of \u03b5 to write\np\u02dc = u\u02dcc\u02dc+O(\u03b5) in place of (2.6) (this approximation is appropriate provided that \u2202 p\u02dc\/\u2202 t\u02dc is bounded).\nOmitting tildes henceforth, in the limit as \u03b5 \u2192 0 we set p = uc and obtain the following system of\nequations for u and c:\n\u2202u\n\u2202 t = u(1\u2212u\u2212 kc)\u2212\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\nu\n\u2202c\n\u2202x\n)\n, (2.7)\n\u2202c\n\u2202 t = \u2212uc\n2. (2.8)\nA novel feature of our model that distinguishes it from existing models (Orme & Chaplain (1996),\nPerumpanani & Byrne (1999) and Anderson et al. (2000)) is the absence of diffusion. This is reasonable\nfor the ECM since it is a large immobile matrix. In addition, malignant cell lines and proteases that\nexhibit minimal diffusion have been observed. Aznavoorian et al. (1990) saw that the haptotactic\nBiphasic behaviour in malignant invasion 7 of 26\n0 0.5 1\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nU(z)\nC(\nz)\nJ\n\u221210 \u22125 0 5 10\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nz\nU(\nz) \n& \nC(\nz) C(z)\nU(z)S N\nFIG. 3.

Furthermore, Tsuboi & Rifkin (1990) stated that uPA, a protease\nproduced by HT1080 cells, is bound to the ECM and therefore does not diffuse.\nWe show below that our reduced model exhibits the same biphasic behaviour as the more complex\ninvasion model developed in Perumpanani & Byrne (1999). Analytical and numerical studies described\nin Marchant et al. (2001) suggest that the inclusion of a small amount of tumour cell random motion\ndoesn\u2019t affect the qualitative behaviour of the model equations. In this respect we believe that our model\ncaptures the key features of tumour invasion needed to realise the observed nonlinear dependence of\nthe tumour invasion speed on the density of the surrounding material, which will be proportional to the\nlocal value of c.\nWe now motivate the boundary and initial conditions that we use to close equations (2.7)-(2.8).\nWe are considering the invasion of malignant cells, initially located near (and to the left of) x = 0 in\na neighbourhood devoid of ECM. The farfield (in the x > 0 direction) is devoid of tumour cells and\noccupied by ECM at some positive concentration c\u02c6, say. Thus we have initially\nu(x,0) = u0(x) and c(x,0) = c0(x), (2.9)\nwhile as time increases\nu(0,t) = 1, (2.10)\nwhere the initial distributions u0(x) and c0(x) are such that\nu0(x) = 1 and c0(x) = 0 at x = 0, (2.11)\nu0(x)\u2192 0 and c0(x)\u2192 c\u02c6 as x\u2192 \u221e. (2.12)\nWe note that our model comprises equations (2.7)-(2.10) and contains only two parameters: k and c\u02c6,\nwhere k is the relative strength of the crowding effect from c to that from itself, and c\u02c6 is the scaled level\nof connective tissue (ECM) in the absence of malignant cells.\n3. Travelling Wave Solutions\nMarchant et al. (2000) studied travelling wave solutions of (2.7)-(2.8) in the absence of contact inhi-\nbition. In particular, using singular phase plane analysis, they demonstrated the existence of a family\nof discontinuous travelling wave solutions to (2.7)-(2.8) for k = 0. Furthermore numerical simulations\ndemonstrated that a member of this family of solutions with a blunt interface at u(x,t)= 0 evolved stably\n8 of 26 B.P. MARCHANT ET AL.\nfrom biologically-realistic, compact initial data. One such solution existed for each set of parameters\nleading to a monotonic relationship between the far-field, tumour-free tissue concentration, c\u02c6 and the\ninvasion speed, a. Figure 3 shows the travelling wave phase plane trajectory and the solution profile\nfor such a blunt interface travelling shock wave occurring when k = 0. Recall that when contact inhibi-\ntion was included by Perumpanani & Byrne (1999) a biphasic relationship between these quantities was\nobserved (see Figure 1). Therefore we now investigate the effect of having k > 0 in (2.7)-(2.8) and in\nparticular how, for travelling wave solutions, the relationship between c\u02c6 and a changes when k > 0.\nWe look for constant form travelling wave solutions for which\nu(x,t)\u2261U(z), c(x,t)\u2261C(z), z\u2261 x\u2212at,\nwhere z is the travelling wave coordinate and the wavespeed a is an unknown (eigenvalue) which we\ndetermine as part of the solution. Under this transformation equations (2.7)-(2.8) reduce to the following\nthird order system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\u2212a dUdz = U(1\u2212U\u2212 kC)\u2212\nd\ndz\n(\nU\ndC\ndz\n)\n, (3.1)\na\ndC\ndz = UC\n2. (3.2)\nwhile equations (2.9)-(2.10) supply\nU \u2192 1, C\u2192 0 as z\u2192\u2212\u221e, (3.3)\nU \u2192 0, C\u2192 c\u02c6 as z\u2192 \u221e, (3.4)\nwhere c\u02c6 > 0. These limits are steady states of equations (3.1)-(3.2): (U,C) = (1,0) represents a situ-\nation where only malignant cells are present and (U,C) = (0, c\u02c6) a situation where only healthy tissue\nis present. Thus we seek a heteroclinic connection between the malignant and normal steady state\nsolutions.\nUsing (3.2) we substitute for dC\/dz in (3.1), thereby reducing the system to the following nonstan-\ndard, second-order form:(\n2UC2\na\n\u2212a\n)\ndU\ndz = U\n(\n1\u2212U\u2212 kC\u2212 2U\n2C3\na2\n)\n, (3.5)\ndC\ndz =\nUC2\na\n. (3.6)\nWe solve (3.5)-(3.6) subject to (3.3)-(3.4). Henceforth, it is convenient to regard a > 0 as fixed and c\u02c6 as\nan unknown eigenvalue.\nThe parameter k only appears once in (3.5)-(3.6). Therefore there are similarities between this\nsystem and the k = 0 system studied in Marchant et al. (2000). In particular equation (3.5) becomes\nsingular on the curve\nS : 2UC2 = a2, (3.7)\nwhich we term the singular barrier. Phase plane trajectories have no meaning on S and can only cross it\nwhen the U nullcline,\nN : U(1\u2212U\u2212 kC)\u2212 2U\n3C3\na2\n= 0, (3.8)\nBiphasic behaviour in malignant invasion 9 of 26\nintersects S, since at this point dU\/dz may still be finite (because of the zero\/zero indeterminate form).\nFollowing Pettet et al. (2000), we call such points \u201choles in the wall\u201d, H.\nFigures 3 and 4 illustrate how the curve N varies with k. Whereas C \u2192 \u221e as U \u2192 0 when k = 0\n(see Figure 3), when k > 0 the curve N crosses U = 0 at C = 1\/k (see Figure 4). This does not affect\nthe nature of the malignant steady state (U,C) = (1,0) (it still has an unstable manifold and an unstable\ncentre manifold), although it does affect the nature of the healthy steady states (U,C) = (0, c\u02c6): for\nc\u02c6 > 1\/k they are unstable whereas for c\u02c6 < 1\/k they remain (linearly) stable. The inclusion of contact\ninhibition also alters the number and positions of the holes in the wall. When k = 0, one hole in the wall\nexists where S and N intersect. By substituting 2UC2 = a2 into (3.8) for k > 0 we deduce that at a hole\nin the wall C =CH where\n2kC3H +a2CH +a2\u22122C2H = 0. (3.9)\nFor example, if a\u001c 1 and k = O(1) then there are two physically relevant holes in the wall (i.e. those\nin the positive quadrant), with coordinates (UH ,CH)\u223c (1,a\/\n\u221a\n2) and (UH ,CH)\u223c (2a2k2,1\/2k).\nIf k = 0 equation (3.9) has one positive real root and one negative real root. For k > 0, using\nDescartes\u2019 Rule of Signs (Abramowitz & Stegun (1965)) it is possible to show that two real positive\nroots exist if\n0 < k < k\u2217 = 1\n27a\n(\n(6+a2)3\/2\u2212a3\u22129a\n)\n. (3.10)\nIn Figure 5 we plot the positive roots of (3.9) as k varies, for a > 0 fixed. This sketch shows how\nthe number of holes in the wall varies with k and suggests that the qualitative behaviour of our two-\ndimensional phase plane depends crucially on the value of k. In particular for k > k\u2217 there are no holes\nin the wall.\nAnother similarity between the k > 0 and k = 0 models is that they admit the same hyperbolic jumps\nsince k does not appear in any of the derivative terms. Marchant et al. (2000) showed that hyperbolic\njumps which satisfied the Lax entropy condition (Courant & Hilbert (1962)) and were therefore stable\nto added viscosity, could take a trajectory directly from the curve (where U =UL, C =CL)\nJ : UC2 = a2, (3.11)\nto (U,C) = (0, c\u02c6) = (UR,CR) and that C remains fixed over this jump (i.e. CL =CR = c\u02c6). Here UL, CL,\nUR and CR denote the values of U and C on the left and right of the jump. Thus, valid travelling wave\nsolutions may involve a smooth connection between (1,0) and the curve J, with a jump from J to (0, c\u02c6)\ncompleting the heteroclinic connection.\nMarchant et al. (2000) observed from numerical solutions of the k = 0 case that the solutions which\nevolved from general initial data included a jump from the curve J to a normal steady state (U,C) =\n(0, c\u02c6). We note that the mid-point of a jump from J to (0, c\u02c6) lies on the singular barrier S, and that the\ntwo steady states (1,0) and (0, c\u02c6) lie on the opposite side of S to the curve J. A connection between (1,0)\nand J must cross S at a hole in the wall, H. Thus, in order to determine whether a travelling wave of the\ndesired form can occur one must determine whether a trajectory that crosses S at H eventually intersects\nJ. Marchant et al. (2000) showed that when k = 0 and for all values of a, a trajectory exists which leaves\nthe malignant steady state (U,C) = (1,0), crosses the singular barrier S at H and then crosses J. An\nexample of such a trajectory is shown in Figure 3. We now investigate whether such trajectories exist\nwhen k > 0. We have described how holes in the wall only exist for k < k\u2217. Thus, for each value of\na, there is an upper bound on the values of k for which blunt travelling shock waves exist. This critical\nvalue of k = k\u2217 decreases monotonically with a according to (3.10).\n10 of 26 B.P.

The U and C nullclines and the jump curve, denoted N, S and J respectively, of the regularised system when k = 0.3 < k\u2217\nand a = 0.9. The C nullcline coincides with the singular barrier S of the original, singular system. The arrows indicate the vector\nfield directions across the nullclines. Note the effect of k in the top left hand corner of the diagram.\n3.1 Regularising the Phase Plane\nIn this section we assume 0 < k < k\u2217 and investigate how competition for space affects the existence\nand uniqueness of heteroclinic connections between the malignant and normal steady state solutions for\nfixed values of a. When 0 < k < k\u2217 the U nullcline and singular barrier intersect twice in the positive\nquadrant of the phase plane (see Figure 4). We denote by H1 the point of intersection with the lowest\nvalue of CH and remark that it corresponds to the hole in the wall of the k = 0 problem. The other\nintersection, H2, occurs due to the altered behaviour of the U nullcline when 0 < k < k\u2217.\nTo understand the behaviour close to H1 and H2 we regularise equations (3.1)-(3.2) via the travelling\nwave variable Z defined by d\/dZ = (2UC2\/a\u2212a)d\/dz to obtain\ndU\ndZ = U(1\u2212U\u2212 kC)\u2212\n2U3C3\na2\n, (3.12)\ndC\ndZ = UC\n2\n(\n2UC2\na2\n\u22121\n)\n. (3.13)\nIn this regularised system, the singular barrier S is transformed to a C nullcline, the direction of trajec-\ntories to the left of S (i.e. when 2UC2 < a2) is reversed and H1 and H2 are steady states.\nIn Figure 4 we plot the nullclines N and S of the transformed system with the jump curve J for\ntypical values of a and k. The direction of the vector field across these nullclines is marked so that the\nnature of the steady states H1 (a saddle) and H2 (a stable spiral) is evident.\nAs for k = 0 (Marchant et al. (2000)), a connection exists between the unstable manifold of H1 and\nthe malignant steady state (U,C) = (1,0). The problem of finding travelling shock waves with a blunt\ninterface reduces to following this trajectory on the other side of S and seeing whether it crosses the\ncurve J. In the regularised system trajectories leaving H1 eventually spiral to H2 (see Figure 7) and, in\nso doing, they cross S. In the original, singular system a trajectory is unable to cross the singular barrier\n(except at holes in the wall). Therefore in the regularised plane we only need follow the trajectory until\nthe point Pend at which it hits S. Since both H1 and Pend lie to the left of the curve J, in moving between\nH1 and Pend the orbit necessarily crosses J an even number of times (either 0 or 2), each intersection\ngiving rise to a different, blunt-form travelling wave solution, for particular values of a and k.\nBiphasic behaviour in malignant invasion 11 of 26\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nk\nC H\nFIG. 5.

A plot of a trajectory (the solid line) leaving the steady state H1 of the regularised system when k = 0.3 and a = 0.7.

This trajectory crosses the J curve twice, the first intersection\noccurring when C = 1.415 and the second when C = 7.290. Hence we anticipate that when k = 0.3, two\nblunt-form travelling wave solutions exist with wavespeed a= 0.7. One of these solutions has c\u02c6= 1.415\nand the other c\u02c6 = 7.290. In Figure 7 the trajectory leaving H1 is plotted for k = 0.3 and a = 0.9. In this\ncase no intersections between the trajectory and the J curve occur so we conclude that no blunt form\ntravelling wave solutions exist for these values of a and k.\nWe may explore how the number of blunt form solutions varies with k via a continuity argument.\nWe note that the S and J curves are independent of k. For a fixed value of C, the U ordinate of the U\nnullcline N decreases as k increases. Therefore H1 moves along S, in the direction of decreasing U , as\nk is increased.

(3.14)\nWhen a trajectory originating from (U,C) = (1,0) crosses H1 it enters a region of the phase plane where\ndU\/dC is negative. When k = 0, the trajectory intersects J once. As k increases, dC\/dU becomes\nless negative and, by continuity, the C-coordinate of the point at which the trajectory first intersects J\nincreases with k. We refer to this value as c\u02c61. We know that the trajectory intersects J either not at\nall or twice. Therefore, if the trajectory intersects once there must be a second intersection at C = c\u02c62.\nContinuity requires that c\u02c62 decreases for increasing k.\nThus for small values of k, intersections occur at C = c\u02c61 and C = c\u02c62 \u223c O(1\/k) and there are two\nvalues of c\u02c6 for which blunt-form travelling wave solutions exist. As k is increased eventually a thresh-\nold value k = kmax < k\u2217 is reached at which c\u02c61 = c\u02c62 and the trajectory makes a tangent with J at the\nBiphasic behaviour in malignant invasion 13 of 26\nintersection point.

Numerical solutions\nof (3.14) (see Figure 6) demonstrate that the phase plane trajectories for the two cases are qualitatively\nsimilar for small C. They both smoothly connect (U,C) = (1,0) to H1 and then continue on the other\nside of the singular barrier. It is only when C becomes large that the effect of the \u2212kUC term becomes\napparent. When k = 0 the trajectory remains to the right of N and S for all further Z but when k > 0 the\ngradient dC\/dU increases (becomes less negative) and eventually becomes zero as it turns over and hits\nthe singular barrier. It is this behaviour which allows the trajectory to cross J twice. We consider this\nbehaviour below by constructing an asymptotic solution starting after the trajectory has moved away\nfrom H1.\nWe study equation (3.14) in a region where C and 2UC2 are large and U is small. We assume U \u001c 1\nand a2 \u001cUC2, and introduce a new variable, w1 =UC3\/2\/a which we substitute into (3.14) to obtain:\nd(w21)\nd(lnC) = w\n2\n1+1\u2212 kC. (3.16)\n14 of 26 B.P. MARCHANT ET AL.\nOn setting w2 = w21 and \u03b6 = lnC, (3.16) may be re-written as\ndw2\nd\u03b6 = w2 +1\u2212 k exp(\u03b6 ), (3.17)\nwhich has solution\nw2(\u03b6 ) = Aexp(\u03b6 )\u22121\u2212 k\u03b6 exp(\u03b6 ), (3.18)\nfor some constant A. In terms of the original variables we have\nU2C3\na2\n= AC\u22121\u2212 kC lnC. (3.19)\nTherefore when k = 0, UC is approximately constant for large C and UC2 is increasing, so the trajectory\nmay only cross J: U = a2\/C2 once. When k > 0 and C is large, the \u2212kC lnC term eventually dominates\ncausing the trajectory to bend towards S and cross J for a second time. This happens when\nC \u2248 exp\n(\nA\nk\n)\n. (3.20)\nThus we have characterised the behaviour of the phase plane trajectories when C is large up to\na constant parameter, A. In order to determine A analytically it would be necessary to construct an\nasymptotic approximation that is valid for the entire trajectory, determining A by matching across the\ndifferent regions of the phase plane. A simple way to see this is to fix C = 1 or C =C0 as the starting\npoint of this curve, with corresponding value U =U0. Then, for k small, we have U20 C30 = a2(AC0\u22121),\nand this fixes A. Hence we need to find the U0-value for curves leaving the hole in the wall when\n0 < a\u001c 1. We could use numerical methods to find A; the difficulty is that the appearance of logC loses\naccuracy significantly.\n3.2 Solutions to the PDE model for k > 0\nOur analysis in the travelling wave phase plane has shown that for each particular combination of k and\na there exists either zero, one or two blunt interface travelling shock wave solutions to (2.7)-(2.8). In\nthe phase plane we fix a and k and determine values of c\u02c6 that give rise to blunt interface solutions. By\ncontrast, when solving the PDE system we fix c\u02c6 and k and calculate the resulting invasion speed a.\nHaving demonstrated the existence of travelling shock wave solutions to (2.7)-(2.8) when k > 0 we\nnow investigate whether such solutions are biologically relevant via numerical simulations. Following\nMarchant et al. (2000) we solve equations (2.7)-(2.8) for k > 0 with a Lax Friedrichs numerical scheme.\nThe Lax Friedrichs method approximates conservation laws of the form\nut +(f(u))x = g(u) ,\nfor vector functions f and g of vector variable u by the scheme\nun+1j =\n1\n2\n(\nunj\u22121+u\nn\nj+1\n)\n\u2212 \u2206 t\n2\u2206x\n(\nf\n(\nunj+1\n)\n\u2212 f\n(\nunj\u22121\n))\n+g\n(\nunj\n)\n.\nHere, unj denotes the value of vector u at location j and time n where the location x and time t axes have\nbeen discretized with spacing \u2206x and \u2206 t respectively. The Lax Friedrichs scheme is only first order\naccurate but it is simple to implement and is not prone to numerical artefacts. For these reasons we\nBiphasic behaviour in malignant invasion 15 of 26\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nt\nx\nu\n(x,\nt)\nFIG. 9. A plot showing the evolution of the u(x,t) profile of a Lax Friedrichs solution to (2.7)-(2.8) from smooth semi-compact\ninitial data of the form (3.21)-(3.22) for k = 0 and c\u02c6 = 1.0.\nfavour it over second order accurate schemes described in Leveque (1982) and Hundsdorfer & Verwer\n(2003).\nWe assume realistic initial conditions for which the tumour cells have compact support.

Initially the interface between u(x,t)> 0 and u(x,t)= 0 remains stationary and the gradient\nof u behind this interface increases. After a finite waiting time, u develops a shock at the interface and\nthis moves forwards at constant speed (waiting times are a characteristic feature of nonlinear diffusion\nproblems, see, for example, Lacey et al. (1982)). For k = 0 the wavespeed of solutions that evolve from\ninitial data (3.21)-(3.22) increases with c\u02c6.\nWhen k > 0, blunt interface travelling wave solutions evolved from initial data of the form (3.21)-\n(3.22). Figure 10 shows that for k = 0.3 the relationship between the wavespeed a of these solutions\nand the chosen farfield tissue concentration c\u02c6 is biphasic. This biphasic relationship may be inferred\nfrom the travelling wave phase plane analysis. When the PDEs (2.7)-(2.8) are solved for a small value\nof c\u02c6 then the resulting solution corresponds to a phase plane trajectory which jumps to U = 0 at the first\nintersection with the J curve. For example, in Figure 11 we present travelling wave solution profiles for\nthe case k = 0.3 and c\u02c6 = 1.415. From Figure 6 we note that this is the lower value of c\u02c6 that occurs when\nk = 0.3 and a = 0.7. We remark further that the wavespeed predicted from the PDE system is in good\nagreement with that used to construct the travelling wave equations (a = 0.695 for the PDE system and\na = 0.70 for the travelling wave solution profiles). We note also that in both cases k < (1\u2212a2\/c2)\/c as\npredicted by the travelling wave analysis of Section 3.1.\nIf c\u02c6 is increased then a increases as when k = 0 until a maximum value of a is reached. This\nsolution corresponds to a phase plane trajectory that makes a tangent with the J curve and on which\nk = (1\u2212a2\/c2)\/c.\nWhen c\u02c6 is increased further the wavespeed decreases. These solutions correspond to trajectories that\n16 of 26 B.P. MARCHANT ET AL.\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\nc\na\nFIG. 10.

Furthermore the biphasic relationship between the\nwavespeed of these solutions and the farfield tissue concentration may be explained within a singular\nphase plane. The wavespeed which results from solving (2.7)-(2.8) for particular values of c\u02c6 and k\nmay be determined by finding the value of a for which a trajectory crossing the singular barrier of\nsystem (3.1)-(3.2) crosses the J curve at c = c\u02c6.

Conclusions and Discussion\nIn this paper we have developed a simple, one-dimensional model of malignant invasion that combines\nfeatures of two existing invasion models (see Perumpanani & Byrne (1999) and Marchant et al. (2000)).\nFor certain parameter values, the model admits discontinuous solutions for which the speed of invasion\nexhibits a biphasic dependence on the concentration of the surrounding gel or tissue, a characteristic\nfeature of tumour invasion (see Figures 1 and 10). We are able to explain how this relationship arises by\nseeking steady travelling wave solutions to the governing equations and analysing the resulting system of\nordinary differential equations within a singular, two-dimensional phase plane (Marchant et al. (2000)).\nThe physically relevant (stable), discontinuous solutions are constructed by connecting trajectories that\npass through specific points on a singular curve in phase space and recross it via a shock when they\nintersect the jump curve. Within this framework, the biphasic behaviour exhibited by our model was due\nto the inclusion of competition for space between the collagen gel and the malignant cells: for certain\nparameter values, this mechanism leads to the existence of two distinct points at which trajectories\nmay cross the singular curve and, hence, two distinct, discontinuous travelling wave solutions. While\nLandman et al. (2003) have studied models which admit two \u201choles in the wall\u201d, to our knowledge, this\nis the first time that their existence has been related to that of pairs of travelling shock wave solutions\nwhich are stable in the sense that, where they exist, both are robust solutions of the underlying PDE\nmodel. Further work is needed to analyse the local and global stability of these discontinuous travelling\nwave solutions. Of additional interest would be investigating whether this result generalises to cases in\nwhich the model possesses three or more holes in the wall and whether other physical mechanisms can\ngive rise to the same phenomenon. In order to address such questions, we propose to use similar phase\nplane techniques to analyse the following model\n\u2202u\n\u2202 t = f (u,c)\u2212\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\nu\u03c7(c)\u2202c\u2202x\n)\n,\n\u2202c\n\u2202 t = g(u,c),\nfor different choices of the production terms f (u,c),g(u,c) and the haptotaxis coefficient\u03c7(c).\n18 of 26 B.P.

The singular barrier S and\nthe U nullcline N intersect once at the hole in the wall H. The singular barrier lies between the malignant steady state (U,C) =\n(1,0) and the curve J. The plot shows a trajectory leaving (U,C) = (1,0), crossing the singular barrier at H and intersecting the\ncurve J twice. From each intersections with J the trajectory may complete the travelling wave solution by jumping down to U = 0,\nwith a blunt wave-front.\nFollowing the methods of Section 3 and fixing g(u,c) = \u2212uc2, we may transform the generalised\nmodel to obtain the following travelling wave equations\n1\na\n(\n2UC2\u03c7(C)\u2212a2\n) dU\ndz = f (U,C)\u2212\nU3C2\na2\nd\ndC\n(\nC2\u03c7(C)\n)\n, (4.1)\ndC\ndz =\nUC2\na\n. (4.2)\nWe note that this system possesses a singular barrier S (when the left hand side of (4.1) is zero) and a U\nnullcline N (when the right hand side of (4.1) is zero).\nApplying the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions to the conservation form of our model, it is possible to\nshow further that this model admits blunt form travelling wave solutions that satisfy the Lax entropy\ncondition and for which U jumps directly to zero from the jump curve J where\nJ : U =\na2\nC2\u03c7(C) . (4.3)\nFor comparison with our earlier work, and in order to illustrate the effect of a nonlinear haptotaxis\ncoefficient on our generalised model, we now fix\nf (U,C) =U(1\u2212U) and \u03c7(C) = C\n4\n(1+C5)2\n. (4.4)\nIn Figures 13 and 14 we plot the curves S, N and J for two values of the wavespeed a. In both cases\nthere is one hole in the wall H in the positive quadrant of the (U,C) phase plane at which S intersects\nN.\nAs with the models already described in this paper, there is a smooth phase plane connection from\nthe malignant steady state (U,C) = (1,0) to the hole in the wall H. This trajectory then crosses the\nsingular barrier into the region where dU\/dz < 0 and dC\/dz > 0. The remaining question is what\nBiphasic behaviour in malignant invasion 19 of 26\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\nU(z)\nC(\nz)\nS\nJ\nN\nFIG. 14. A plot of the phase plane behaviour for (4.1)-(4.2) with \u03c7(C) defined by (4.4) and a = 0.5. The curves S and N intersect\nonce H, with S lying between the malignant steady state (U,C) = (1,0) and the curve J. The plot shows a trajectory leaving\n(U,C) = (1,0), and crossing the singular barrier at H. Unlike Figure 13 (when a = 0.365) this trajectory does not cross J and,\ntherefore, no travelling wave solutions with a blunt U wave-front exist for this value of a.\nhappens to this trajectory once it has crossed S. In particular, does it cross the curve J and then complete\na blunt interface connection to a healthy steady state (U,C) = (0, c\u02c6)?\nThe modified haptotactic function causes the gradient dC\/dU of the curve N to become positive\non this side of the singular barrier. Therefore for each of the values of a the trajectory (which initially\nhas dC\/dU < 0) soon crosses N for a second time, after it has passed through H. The gradient dU\/dz\nis positive thereafter leading to non-monotonic U(z) profiles. For small values of a the trajectory then\ncrosses J twice, meaning that there are two values of c\u02c6 for which blunt profile solutions exist with this\nvalue of a. There is a critical value of a for which the trajectory intersects J tangentially and for all\nvalues of a greater than this critical value there is no intersection between the trajectory and J. This\nleads again to a biphasic relationship between a and c\u02c6.\nThe results from numerical solutions to the PDEs using the Lax Friedrichs scheme are consistent\nwith this phase plane behaviour. Initial data where u0(x) has semi-compact support evolves to travelling\nwave solutions with blunt u(x,t) interfaces at the front of the wave. Figure 15 shows how the wavespeed\nof such solutions behaves in a biphasic manner as c\u02c6 is varied. In Figure 16 we plot the profiles of a\ntypical numerical solution of (4.1)-(4.2). The blunt front and non-monotonicity of the U profile can be\nseen. Anderson et al. (2000) obtained similar numerical profiles from their model of malignant invasion\nwhich combined haptotaxis and random motion. However, the higher order of their equations prevented\nthem from deriving analytical insight into the origins of the non-monotonic profile.\nOur brief investigation of the modified model illustrates that the existence of multiple holes in the\nwall is not necessary for obtaining a biphasic relationship between the wave speed a and the farfield\nECM concentration c\u02c6. Future work will involve establishing how the number of blunt form travelling\nwave solutions that such models admit depends on the number of (physically relevant) holes in the wall\nand the structure of the jump curve J.\nThere are naturally many ways in which our simple model of malignant invasion could be extended.\nFor example, it could be combined with the models developed by Gatenby & Gawlinski (1996) to\ninvestigate the additional effect that local pH levels have on the invasion process. Alternatively, it could\nbe combined with the models developed by Chen et al. (2001) and Roose et al. (2003) to study the\nmanner in which the mechanical properties of the healthy tissue influence tumour invasion. Equally,\n20 of 26 B.P.

Typical travelling wave profiles of tumour cells u(x,t = 20) and connective tissue c(x,t = 20) obtained via the numerical\nsolution of the PDEs with haptotactic coefficient (4.4). This solution, with the blunt wave-front for u(x,t = 20), evolves from\nsemi-compact initial conditions (3.21)-(3.22). Observe the non-monotonicity of the u profile. For this solution c\u02c6 = 1.25 and \u03c7(c)\nis defined in (4.4).\nby incorporating some of the detailed biochemistry described in the introduction and by focussing on\nspecific cancers, it should be possible to extend and specialise the model so that it generates better\ntestable predictions. For example, we might focus on the role of the metalloprotease MMP-2 and its\ninhibitor TIMP-2 in the invasion and progression of breast carcinoma (Shiomi & Okada (2003)).\nIn spite of its simplicity, our mathematical model is able to reproduce several key features of malig-\nnant invasion studied in vitro. We now explain how our model may have wider practical implications.\nFirst, our results regarding the biphasic dependence of tumour invasion on the concentration of the host\ntissue may explain why certain tumours metastasize preferentially to specific organs: secondary tumours\nare likely to develop in distant organs if the concentration of the tissue matrix there is such that the in-\nvasion speed of any tumour fragments that colonise the tissue is the same as (or greater than) that at\nthe site of the primary tumour. Thus by performing in vitro experiments to construct the biphasic curve\nshowing how invasion wavespeed varies with ECM density or composition and combining these results\nBiphasic behaviour in malignant invasion 21 of 26\nwith measurements of the ECM composition of other organs it should be possible to predict those tis-\nsues through which the tumour cells will spread most readily: these predictions could then be tested by\nmonitoring the sites at which metastases appear.\nOur results may also provide insight into the limited success with which protease inhibitors have\nbeen able to arrest tumour invasion. The principle underlying this treatment is that the inhibitors will\nneutralise proteases produced by the tumour cells and leave the surrounding healthy tissue intact (Stetler-\nStevenson et al. (1993)). For example, in one family of Apcmin mice overexpression of TIMP1 had no\neffect on tumour development although it enhanced intestinal adenoma formation in another family,\nthe latter family experiencing slower growth when treated with a different metalloprotease inhibitor\n(Heppner-Goss et al. (1998)). From Figure 10 it is clear that if, in the absence of treatment, the underly-\ning tissue concentration is such that the speed of invasion increases as the tissue concentration increases,\nthen a treatment which increases the concentration of the tissue may actually increase the speed with\nwhich the tumour invades. More constructively, given estimates of model parameters such as the con-\ncentration of the healthy tissue into which a tumour is invading and its doubling rate, our model could\nbe used to identify those patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment with protease inhibitors.\nIn particular, we predict that patients whose tumours are such that the models parameters reside on\nthe increasing branch of a biphasic curve would benefit from treatment with tissue-degrading proteases\nwhereas those on the decreasing branch would benefit from treatment with protease inhibitors \u2013 in both\ncases we would expect a reduction in the speed of tumour invasion.\nAcknowledgements\nFigures 1 and 2 were reprinted from the European Journal of Cancer, Volume 35, Perumpanani AJ and\nByrne HM, Extracellular matrix concentration exerts selection pressure on invasive cells, Pages 1274-\n1280, Copyright(1999) with permission from Elsevier.

In the solution profiles, the blunt interface in the U profile can\nbe clearly seen as can the corresponding corner in the C profile.\n4. The U and C nullclines and the jump curve, denoted N, S and J respectively, of the regularised\nsystem when k = 0.3 < k\u2217 and a = 0.9. The C nullcline coincides with the singular barrier S of\nthe original, singular system. The arrows indicate the vector field directions across the nullclines.\nNote the effect of k in the top left hand corner of the diagram.\n24 of 26 B.P. MARCHANT ET AL.\n5. A sketch showing how the positive solutions CH of (3.9) depend upon k for a fixed value of a.\nParameter values: a = 0.9,k\u2217 = 0.37.\n6. A plot of a trajectory (the solid line) leaving the steady state H1 of the regularised system when\nk = 0.3 and a = 0.7. The trajectory intersects the J curve twice; first when C = 1.415 and second\nwhen C = 7.290.\n7. A plot of a trajectory (the solid line) leaving the steady state H1 of the regularised system when\nk = 0.3 and a = 0.9. The curves J and S are unchanged, whereas N is changed, especially near\nthe C axis.\n8. An illustration of the continuity argument which demonstrates that c\u02c6max increases with k. The\nsingular barrier\/C nullcline and J curve for a = 0.9 are shown along with the corresponding U\nnullclines for k = 0.1,0.2. The hole in the wall H1 moves from right to left as k is increased. The\ntrajectories leaving H1 are also marked. dC\/dU becomes less negative as k is increased and thus\nthe C value where the trajectories cross J increases.\n9. A plot showing the evolution of the u(x,t) profile of a Lax Friedrichs solution to (2.7)-(2.8) from\nsmooth semi-compact initial data of the form (3.21)-(3.22) for k = 0 and c\u02c6 = 1.0.\nBiphasic behaviour in malignant invasion 25 of 26\n10. A plot of the wavespeed a of travelling wave solutions to (2.7)-(2.8) (evolving from semi-compact\ninitial conditions) against the far-field concentration c\u02c6 of connective tissue when k = 0.3. These\nwavespeeds were approximated from Lax Friedrichs numerical solutions to (2.7)-(2.8).\n11. Travelling wave profiles of u(x,t) and c(x,t) resulting from numerical solution of (2.7)-(2.8) with\ncompact initial data (3.21)-(3.22) for k=0.3 and c\u02c6 = 1.415. The measured wavespeed of the\nsolution profiles was a = 0.695.\n12. Travelling wave profiles of u(x,t) and c(x,t) resulting from numerical solution of (2.7)-(2.8) with\ncompact initial data (3.21)-(3.22) for k=0.3 and c\u02c6 = 7.290. The measured wavespeed of the\nsolution profiles was a = 0.702.\n13. A plot of the phase plane behaviour for (4.1)-(4.2) with \u03c7(C) defined by (4.4) and a= 0.365. The\nsingular barrier S and the U nullcline N intersect once at the hole in the wall H. The singular\nbarrier lies between the malignant steady state (U,C) = (1,0) and the curve J. The plot shows a\ntrajectory leaving (U,C) = (1,0), crossing the singular barrier at H and intersecting the curve J\ntwice. From each intersections with J the trajectory may complete the travelling wave solution by\njumping down to U = 0, with a blunt wave-front.\n26 of 26 B.P. MARCHANT ET AL.\n14. A plot of the phase plane behaviour for (4.1)-(4.2) with \u03c7(C) defined by (4.4) and a = 0.5. The\ncurves S and N intersect once H, with S lying between the malignant steady state (U,C) = (1,0)\nand the curve J. The plot shows a trajectory leaving (U,C) = (1,0), and crossing the singular\nbarrier at H. Unlike Figure 13 (when a = 0.365) this trajectory does not cross J and, therefore, no\ntravelling wave solutions with a blunt U wave-front exist for this value of a.\n15. A plot of the wavespeed, a, of travelling wave solutions to the PDE model evolving from semi-\ncompact initial data, against the far-field concentration of connective tissue c\u02c6, for \u03c7(c) defined in\n(4.4). There is a biphasic relationship between a and c\u02c6.\n16. Typical travelling wave profiles of tumour cells u(x,t = 20) and connective tissue c(x,t = 20)\nobtained via the numerical solution of the PDEs with haptotactic coefficient (4.4). This solution,\nwith the blunt wave-front for u(x,t = 20), evolves from semi-compact initial conditions (3.21)-\n(3.22). Observe the non-monotonicity of the u profile. For this solution c\u02c6 = 1.25 and \u03c7(c) is\ndefined in (4.4).\n"}
