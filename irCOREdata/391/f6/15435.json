However, there has been less focus on the important \nrole of place in shaping the distribution of risk factors. Spatial variations in worklessness are one \nsuch factor. In this paper then we examine the extent to which between and within regional \ndifferences in the social gradient in self-rated general health are associated with differences in \nrates of worklessness.  \nMethods: Data were obtained for men and women of working age (25-59) who had ever \nworked from the Sample of Anonymised Records (Individual SAR) - a 3% representative \nsample of the 2001 English Census (349,699 women and 349,181 men). Generalised linear \nmodels were used to calculate region and age adjusted prevalence difference for not good \nhealth by education (as an indicator of socio-economic status) and employment status. The \nslope index of inequality was also calculated for each region.  \nResults: For both men and women, educational inequalities in worklessness and not good \nhealth are largest in those regions with the highest overall levels of worklessness. Adjusting for \nworklessness considerably attenuated the educational health gradient within all English \nregions (by over 60%) and virtually eliminated between region differences.  \nDiscussion: Macroeconomic policies which influence the demand for labour may have an \nimportant role in creating inequalities in general health of the working age population both \nwithin and between regions. Employment policy may therefore be one important approach to \ntackling spatial and socio-economic health inequalities. \n \nAbstract: 246 words; Manuscript word count: 4689 (including references) \n \nKeywords: worklessness, employment, Census, health inequalities, regions, education.  \n 2 \nBACKGROUND \nWorklessness is an important determinant of health with unemployment and other forms of \neconomic inactivity (such as lone parenthood or long term sickness absence) being associated \nwith an increased likelihood of morbidity and mortality (Bartley, 1994; Morris et al, 1994; \nMartikainen and Valkonen, 1996; Korpi, 2001; Rodriguez, 2001; Bartley and Plewis, 2002; \nBartley et al, 2006). There is, for example, a well established literature on the individual and \narea level relationship between unemployment and increased risk of poor mental health and \nparasuicide, higher rates of all cause mortality, self reported health and limiting long term \nillness, and, in some studies, a higher prevalence of risky health behaviours (amongst young \nmen), including problematic alcohol use and smoking (Bartley et al, 2006). Research has also \ndrawn attention to the contributory role of ill health itself as a factor behind worklessness (Jusot \net al, 2008), not least in the form of long term sickness absence (Beatty and Fothergill, 2002; \nBambra and Norman, 2006; Norman and Bambra, 2007; MacKay and Davies, 2007). Ill health \nrelated job loss has a social gradient, with adverse employment consequences more likely for \nthose in lower socio-economic (i.e. lower educated) groups (Bartley and Owen, 1996). \nWorklessness is associated with poverty and social exclusion, and it tends to be concentrated \nin lower socio-economic groups (Arber, 1987; Rodriguez, 2001). Worklessness is therefore a \nvery important social determinant and in a recent paper, we demonstrated its contribution to \nthe overall social gradient in health (Popham and Bambra, 2010). We found that prevalence \ndifferences by education in the 2001 English Census of not good health were reduced by 50% \nor over when adjusting for employment status (Popham and Bambra, 2010). However, no \nstudy has yet examined the contribution of regional differences in the rates of worklessness to \nregional differences in socio-economic health inequalities. \n \nSimilarly, while there has been much recent focus in health geography on separating \ncontextual and compositional influences on social inequalities in health there has been less \nfocus on the important role of place in shaping the distribution of risk factors (Tunstall et al, \n2004). One clear example is the regional variation in employment rates in England associated \nwith the lasting effects of de-industrialisation (Erdem and Glyn, 2001). In the latter part of the \n20\nth\n century, there were regionally concentrated falls in the demand for labour (most notably in \n 3 \nthe North East, North West and Wales), particularly affecting those with less education (Nickell \nand Quintini, 2002). These regional differences have led to large spatial and socio-economic \nvariations in employment rates which may be further exacerbated by the recent economic \nrecession (Fothergill, 2001; Mackay and Davies, 2007; Nickell and Quintini, 2002). These \ntrends are seen for both men and women, despite an overall expansion of employment for \nwomen in the last 30 years (Nickell and Quintini, 2002). In the long term, this socially and \nspatially stratified lack of demand for labour has not expressed itself in terms of higher rates of \nunemployment but instead as structural worklessness - particularly sickness and incapacity \nrelated economic inactivity (Beatty and Fothergil, 2005; Fothergill, 2001; Mackay and Davies, \n2007; Nickell and Quintini, 2002).  \n \nPrevious research has shown that the highest levels of working age morbidity and mortality are \nconcentrated in the same regions and socio-economic groups most affected by this reduced \ndemand for labour (Doran et al, 2004; Woods et al, 2005). Therefore, we hypothesise that the \nincreased risk of worklessness may play an important role in both spatial (regional) and socio-\neconomic (educational) inequalities in general health. This study examines whether between \nand within regional differences in the educational social gradient in self-rated general health \nare associated with differences in rates of worklessness. Specifically, using data on self-rated \nhealth from the 2001 English Census, this study addresses two inter-related questions:  \n \n1. To what extent are educational inequalities in health within regions of England \nattenuated after accounting for variations in employment status?  \n2. Are differences between regions in their educational gradient in health changed by \naccounting for employment status? \n \nMETHODS \nData and variables  \nThe dataset used in this study is the Individual Sample of Anonymised Records (Individual \nSAR) a 3% sample of the 2001 UK Census. The Samples of Anonymised Records scheme \nprovides researchers with access to completely anonymised Census data to allow detailed \n 4 \nmicro level analysis. The Individual SAR was chosen for this study as it contained sufficiently \ndetailed coding on employment status and socio-economic position. Full details on the \nSamples of Anonymised Records and the Individual SAR have been published (Cathy Marsh \nCentre for Census and Survey Research, 2007). The 2001 English Census aimed to cover the \nwhole population (i.e. 100%) through Census returns (estimated response rate of 94%) and \nimputation of missing individuals based on further enumeration by a detailed and extensive \npost Census face to face survey. Imputation was also used in cases of missing answers (Cathy \nMarsh Centre for Census and Survey Research, 2007). We limited our analysis to people of \nworking age (25 to 59) and additionally excluded full time students and those living in \ncommunal residences (e.g. hospitals). The working age population was restricted to those \naged 25-59 for the following reasons: 1) as we also excluded full time students, the remaining \nunder 25 age group would be very selective; 2) it was limited to 59 years old because the data \nis from 2001 when the state pension age for women in England was still 60 and we wanted \nmale and female data to be comparable; 3) the 59 years cut off also reflects the Census age \nbands (i.e. 44-59). We also excluded the 1.3% of men and 3.9% of women who had never \nworked. The final sample sizes were thus 349,699 women and 349,181 men. \n \nThe Census form is available online (http:\/\/www.statistics.gov.uk\/Census2001\/pdfs\/H1.pdf). \nSelf-rated general health was assessed in the Census, for the first time in 2001, by the \nfollowing question \u201cOver the last twelve months would you say your health has on the whole \nbeen \u2026 Good? Fairly good? Not good?\u201d Following others we dichotomised responses to \ncompare people reporting \u201cnot good\u201d health to those reporting \u201cgood or fairly good\u201d health \n(Doran et al, 2004). Self-rated general health was a new question on the 2001 Census and \nwas chosen in preference to the existing question on limiting illness as it did not include in its \ndefinition limitations to work and thus is independent in definition from employment status. The \nquestion was asked on the Census form before a question on having a limiting illness and \nbefore questions on employment status.  \n \nEmployment status was derived in the Census through a number of questions and was coded \nas follows: employed, unemployed (that is not in employment but actively seeking \n 5 \nemployment) and the following categories of economic inactivity (not in employment and not \nactively seeking employment), retired, looking after home \/ family, permanently sick or \ndisabled, and other economically inactive (including part-time students and people not \nregarding themselves as being in the other categories of economic inactivity).  \n \nSocio-economic position is a multifaceted construct (Galobardes et al, 2006). We focus on \neducation as our marker of socio-economic position as it is both important for future \nemployment and also reflects socio-economic background (Breen and Jonsson, 2005; Jackson \net al, 2005). As most people achieve their highest qualifications by their early 20s, it is also \nunlikely to be influenced by adult employment or health situation (Kreiger et al, 1997). In the \n2001 Census, education was based on the level of the highest qualification and having a \nprofessional qualification and was coded using standard Census categories: No qualifications, \nother qualifications (not covered in the following categories), level 1 (minimal end of \ncompulsory schooling qualifications - age 16), level 2 (end of compulsory schooling \nqualifications or minimal end of post compulsory schooling qualifications or vocational \nequivalent \u2013 age 18), level 3 (post compulsory schooling qualifications or vocational equivalent \nqualifications), level 4\/5 (higher education degree or vocational equivalent or professional \nqualification (e.g. doctor, teacher, nurse). \n \nIn England, there are nine regions (see Box 1 for descriptions of the regions). These all have \nGovernment Offices which are administratively and economically important in terms of having \nsome devolved responsibility for the local economy including the allocation of regional \ndevelopment funds, drawing up regional economic strategies, and encouraging inward regional \ninvestment (including the receipt of European Union funding). One of the main tasks of \nregional Government Offices are \u201cto strengthen the economy in every region, working to \nreduce the gap in economic growth rates between the regions\u201d (Government Offices, 2010). \nRegional public health groups and Strategic Health Authorities also exist at a regional level \nand some public health interventions are regionally operated and coordinated. Further \ninformation on the role of the English regions is available at: http:\/\/www.gos.gov.uk\/national\/. \n 6 \nAs the most prosperous and \u201chealthy\u201d region in England is the South East (Doran et al, 2004), \nwe use this as the reference region when applicable.  \n \nFinally, age was available in the individual SAR dataset in the following banded categories: 25 \nto 29, 30 to 44 and 45 to 59. \n \nAnalysis \nAs men and women vary in employment patterns we conducted separate analysis for each. To \nobtain age standardised rates of employment and not good health by education and region we \nused direct standardisation using the overall sex specific population as the reference. To \ndescribe the educational gradient in the prevalence of not good health within each region we \ncalculated the slope index of inequality. The slope index of inequality summaries in a single \nmeasure the difference in the rate of health across an ordered categorical variable (in this case \neducation) taking account of the rate in all categories and the percentage of people in each \ncategory. This means that the gradient can be compared between regions (in our case) in \nwhich levels of education may vary. To calculate the slope index of inequality each category of \nthe education variable was coded between 0 and 1. The exact value assigned to each \ncategory of education was at its mid-point on the cumulative distribution of the categories \nwithin the region (Mackenbach and Kunst, 1997). So for example, if the highest education \ncategory included 20% of the region\u2019s population then this would be coded 0.1 (0.2\/2), and if \nthe next highest category included 30% then this would be coded 0.35 (0.2+0.3\/2) and so on. \nThis variable was then entered into a regression model as a continuous covariate with health \nas the outcome and with additional adjustment for age. The coefficient of the continuous \neducation covariate is the slope index of inequality and can be interpreted as the difference in \nprevalence across the educational categories (the gradient) from the (theoretical) highest (0) \neducated to the (theorectical) lowest educated (1) (Mackenbach and Kunst, 1997). \nWe fitted models using linear regression and robust standard errors as this is a validated \nmethod for obtaining prevalence differences in binary health variables (Cheung, 2007). \nTo assess the impact of employment status on the education gradient we then added the \nemployment status variable to the models and calculated the percentage reduction in the \n 7 \neducation gradient (the slope index of inequality) using the formula (prevalence difference in \nage adjusted model \u2013 prevalence difference in age and employment adjusted model) \/ \n(prevalence difference in age adjusted model). Where initial age adjusted prevalence \ndifference was negative (lower than the reference category) we did not calculate the \npercentage reduction. \nTo make a direct test of how the education gradient varied between regions, we combined the \nseparate regional regressions using seemingly unrelated estimation. This is a method of \ncombining separate regression models so that the same coefficient in each model (in our case \nthe education gradient) can be compared. Having combined the separate regressions we then \ntested the difference in each region\u2019s gradient compared to the South East\u2019s, for both the age \nand age and employment adjusted models. \nIn sensitivity analysis we refitted the models treating education categorically with the highest \n(level 4\/5) as the reference category. .Additionally, we split the sample into two to compare \ninequalities for those aged 25 to 44 and 45 to 59. Stata 10.1 was used for all analysis. \n \nRESULTS \nOverall 85.7% of men and 73.2% of women were employed in 2001 with regions of the north \nand London having the lowest levels (Table 1). There were also variations in employment by \neducational level within each region as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 (with the age adjusted \nrates used given in supplemental Table 1). For both men and women employment rates \ndecline with lower education but differences are largest in those regions with the lowest levels \nof employment. For example the overall age adjusted rate of male employment in the \nprosperous South East was 89.9% while in the North East it was just over ten points lower at \n79.2%. However, for men with level 4\/5 qualifications the rates were 93.2% and 90.9% in the \nSouth East and North East respectively but for men with no educational qualifications rates \nwere 80.8% and 62.7% respectively.  \n \nRates of not good health were higher amongst non-employed groups for both men and women \nin all regions (Table 2). For example, amongst men in the South East, differences in the \nprevalence of not good health were 6.6 (5.2 - 8.0) for the unemployed, 8.0 (5.9 \u2013 10.1) for the \n 8 \nretired, 5.7 (3.2 \u2013 8.2) for those looking after the home, 66.5 (64.4 \u2013 68.6) amongst the \npermanently sick, and 18.6 (16.1 to 21.1) for the other category. In terms of not good health by \nregion and education, (Table 1, Figures 3 and 4 and supplemental table 2) differences in the \nprevalence between regions tends to increase for those with lower education. In the South \nEast the age adjusted gradient in not good health for men represented by the slope index of \ninequality (see Table 3) was an 8 percentage point difference between the highest and lowest \neducated. The gradient was significantly steeper in all other regions apart from the East of \nEngland and the South West. For example in the North East it was 17.4 percentage points. For \nwomen the patterns were similar although gradients less steep (see Table 4).  \n \nAfter additional adjustment for employment status the gradient was substantially reduced by \nover 60% in all regions. Regional gradients also became similar with only London still having a \nsignificantly larger gradient than the South East for men and women. While the North East\u2019s \ngradient was actually smaller than the South East\u2019s for women. Supplemental tables 4 and 5 \nshow the prevalence differences in health for men and women by individual category of \neducation (compared to levels 4\/5) within regions.  \n \nTable 5 shows the sensitivity analysis in which the slope index of inequality in education for \nmen and women was split between those aged under 45 and those aged 45 and above. For \nthe oldest age group the slope indexes of inequality were large before adjustment for \nemployment status and varied by region with low employment regions having the highest \nlevels of inequality, regional differences and the actual slopes were attenuated by adjustment \nfor employment status as seen in the overall results. For under 45s the slope indexes of \ninequality were less, with regional variations more apparent for men than women, again \nadjustment for employment status attenuated the slope index and regional inequalities, \nalthough London still had higher inequalities than the South East after adjustment. \n \n \nDISCUSSION \nIn summary, the results suggest that for both men and women differences in levels of \nworklessness play a significant role in educational inequalities in self-rated general health and \n 9 \nin differences in the educational gradient between the regions of England. This extends the \nwork of Arber (1987) who suggested an important role for employment status in understanding \nhealth inequalities in general health. It also extends previous work on inequalities in general \nhealth using the 2001 UK census that showed similar regional patterns, using relative risks, but \ndid not consider the impact of employment status (Doran et al, 2004). Similarly, our age \nspecific analysis revealed that regional differences and their attenuation by employment were \nnot simply limited to the oldest age group. While there was some positive signs for regional \ndifferences in female health amongst the 25 to 44 year olds, educational differences were still \napparent and regional differences associated with employment still apparent even for the \nyoungest men. This is worrying as it suggests a persistence of regional health inequalities in \nthe future (Erdem and Glyn, 2001). Regional health inequalities are therefore likely to continue \ninto the future then unless the unequal levels of worklessness and economic development are \ntackled. The economic recession which began in 2008 may also further exacerbate the trends \nwe have noted.   \n \nOf course whether worklessness causes poor health per se is subject to continuing debate with \nsome commentators arguing that health selection could be an important factor (Martikainen et \nal, 2007). Probably the best longitudinal evidence in regards to self reported health and its \nrelationship with employment status within the UK comes from longitudinal studies of the \nBritish Household Panel Survey (Bartley et al, 2004; Sacker et al, 2007; Thomas et al, 2005).  \nThese studies have shown that recovery from poor mental health (Thomas et al, 2005), limiting \nillness (Bartley et al, 2004) and general health are associated with returning to employment \n(Sacker et al, 2007) and that deterioration in health is associated with periods of worklessness \nregardless of socio-economic circumstances. So there is strong evidence of a causal link \nbetween employment and self-rated health although further quasi experimental work is needed \n(Oswald, 2007). Our results are therefore suggestive of a possibly very important role for \nemployment policy in socio-economic and spatial health inequalities. \n \nOur results therefore have some important implications for the direction of public policy and for \nthe strategies required to substantially reduce socio-economic and spatial health inequalities. \n 10 \nFirstly, our results have once more highlighted the universal experience of poorer self reported \nhealth amongst the unemployed and economically inactive of all socio-economic groups and \nacross all regions. This is in keeping with previous studies of the health of the unemployed \nwhich have found that, across a diversity of health indicators, employment is better for health \nthan unemployment (for an overview see Bartley et al, 2006). Public policy has an important \ninfluence on the social, economic and health consequences of the lack of employment as \nbenefit rates can be raised to prevent material deprivation, and resources and services can be \nmade available to enhance social inclusion (Bartley and Blane, 1997). Indeed a comparative \ninternational study has shown that the health of the unemployed and economically inactive is \nimproved by higher rates of state benefits (Rodriguez, 2001). Secondly, our results have \nreinforced the importance of worklessness to the social gradient in health (Arber 1987; \nPopham and Bambra, 2010). This suggests that policies to reduce health inequalities, not just \nbetween the most affluent and the poorest, but across the whole social gradient may need to \nfocus on increasing the proportion of people in paid employment. This translates as not just the \nneed to get people into work or to help people maintain employment in times of adversity (such \nas ill health), but also an increase in the demand for labour particularly in regions and areas \nstill suffering from the consequences of de-industrialisation (Coombes and Raybould, 2004). \nFinally, and most importantly, our finding that educational differences in not good health were \nlargest in regions with the lowest levels of employment and that adjusting for individual \nemployment status attenuated both the regional variation in health inequalities suggests an \nimportant role for regional employment policy in spatial differences in health inequalities.  \nMacroeconomic change and public policy responses to it are therefore very important for \nunderstanding spatial variations in health inequalities within countries.  \n \n \nStrengths and limitations  \nIn our analysis we made efforts to minimise health selection (present health state causing non-\nemployment rather than vice versa) by limiting analysis to only those who had ever worked. \nUsing education as our measure of socio-economic position also gave some protection against \npresent health changing socio-economic position. However it is important to recognise that our \n 11 \nanalysis is cross-sectional and that present health could lead to a loss of employment. We \nwould argue that our regional analysis also offers some protection from health selection as it is \nunlikely that the different rates of employment in the regions would be purely as a result of \ndifferent levels of health selection. Selective migration away from low employment regions may \nalso have influenced our results, however evidence  suggests that regional migration rates in \nthe UK are low and much more  common amongst higher rather than lower socio-economic \ngroups  (McCormick, 1997).  Also it has been found that at the regional level migration has little \nimpact on health inequalities (Brimblecombe et al, 1999). Another limitation is our use of the \nnine English Government Office Regions as the spatial unit of analysis the results of our \nanalysis may differ if a lower geographical level (such as Local Authority Districts) had been \nused.  Strengths include the large sample size, the representativeness of census data, the use \nof a general health question independent in definition to work and the focus on absolute levels \nof health.  \n \nCONCLUSION \nHealth geography has focused on separating contextual and compositional influences on \nsocial inequalities in health. However, there has been less focus on the important role of place \nin shaping the distribution of risk factors (Tunstall et al, 2004). This paper is the first to examine \nregional variation in employment rates in England as an example of the role of place in shaping \nthe distribution of social risks to health and of the social gradient in health. We have found that \nworklessness is a very important determinant of the social gradient in self-rated health within \nthe regions of England and in differences in the size of health inequalities between the English \nregions. Our analysis leads us to conclude that differences in regional employment rates \naccount for why health inequalities are worse in some regions (such as the North East) than \nothers (specifically the South East). This underscores the important role of place in shaping the \ndistribution of risk factors for poor health. Our study also highlights the importance of \nmacroeconomic change and public policy responses to it in terms of structuring spatial and \nsocioeconomic health inequalities.  \n \n 12 \nREFERENCES \nArber, S.

It is the 22nd \nlargest economy in the world. The South East economy is advanced, high income, broadly \nbased and service oriented. (Population size 2001 census = 8,000,645; Number in this study = \n115,868) \n \nThe North East has suffered from sustained economic decline as industries such as coal \nmining and ship building have virtually disappeared. It has the highest proportion of workless \nhouseholds and deprivation in any UK region. (Population size 2001 census = 2,515,442; \nNumber in this study = 35,663) \n \nThe Northwest regional economy went through a major period of restructuring and \nunderperformance during the 1980s and 1990s but since then has grown faster than the \nEngland average. The region\u2019s economic activity rate is lower than every other English region \nexcept the North East. (Population size 2001 census =  6,729,764; Number in this study = \n93,412) \n \nYorkshire and the Humber ranks amongst the top 20% national economies in the world. In the \n1980s and 1990s the region suffered from decline in its traditional industries in coal mining, \nsteel, engineering and textiles. However, GDP within the region grew by 12% in 2001-2007, \ncompared to 9% on average within the UK and 6% in the EU15. (Population size 2001 census \n= 4,964,833; Number in this study = 69,006) \n \nIn the East Midlands, manufacturing represents 23% of output and sectors that involve a high \npercentage of low skilled jobs are more dominant in the region. Whilst the economy has high \nemployment and relatively high levels of economic growth, it performs less well than the UK \naverage on productivity.  (Population size 2001 census =  4,172,174; Number in this study = \n59,955) \n \nThe West Midlands has undergone significant economic changes over the last three decades \nwith the services sector replacing manufacturing as the principal source of employment. The \nregion contributes 8% of the UK\u2019s Gross Domestic Product. However, despite recent \nimprovements, income per head is around 11% lower than the UK average. (Population size \n2001 census = 5,267,308; Number in this study = 73,092) \n \nThe East of England has one of the highest long-term economic growth rates in the UK. The \nregion forms part of the Greater South East (alongside London and South East England). The \nEast of England is the most research and development-intensive region in the UK. Levels of \neconomic growth vary across the region. (Population size 2001 census = 5,388,140; Number \nin this study = 78,093) \n \nThe South West is a relatively productive and wealthy region yet there are some persistent \npockets of disadvantage. The region is characterised by a largely rural landscape. 81% of jobs \nare in the service sector. In recent years, South West England has performed relatively well \nwithin a UK economy but output per head remained 7% below the UK average. (Population \nsize 2001 census = 4,928,434  ; Number in this study = 68,919 ) \n \nLondon has the UK\u2019s highest productivity rate, and is the world\u2019s 4th largest economy. \nEmployment is dominated by the financial, business and creative industries. 29% of residents \nare from minority ethnic groups and the region contains some areas with high levels of \ndeprivation and worklessness (e.g. 35% of London children live in poverty - the highest \nproportion of any English region).
