Scope: monograph. Level: undergraduate and\npostgraduate.\nJohn Scott Russell\u2019s 1834 observation of what he called \u201cThe great solitary wave\u201d was\na remarkable discovery by an interesting man whose achievements were not appreciated\nwithin his own lifetime. He was riding his horse along the Union Canal near Edinburgh,\nwatching a barge being pulled along the narrow channel by a pair of horses. When the\nbarge suddenly stopped, the water that had been moving with it surged on to create a\nsolitary wave \u2013 a \u201crounded smooth and well defined heap of water\u201d travelling at eight or\nnine miles per hour, preserving its shape as it moved. On his horse, he was able to follow\nit, overtake it, watch it as it travelled, and cogitate about it. It made a deep impression\non him, and he subsequently performed several experiments on such waves, both on\ncanals and in tanks. His 1844 report summarising the results for the 14th meeting of\nthe British Association for the Advancement of Science was so strongly criticised by Airy\nand Stokes, however, that he abandoned the research completely (though he continued to\nexcel in other directions in his profession as an engineer). His discovery was successfully\nre-enacted during a conference at nearby Heriot-Watt University in 1995.\nIt was not until 1895 that a satisfactory understanding of Russell\u2019s observations and\nexperiments was achieved, through the work of Kortweg and de Vries. Their KdV equation\nhas remarkable mathematical properties that encompass the characteristic features of\nwhat are now called solitons. For example, there are solutions involving surface waves that\ntravel without change of shape and proceed at supersonic velocity, i.e. exceed the speed\nof small-amplitude linear surface waves. Since then, it has become evident that solitons\nand soliton-like phenomena occur widely in physics and in the natural world, e.g. as\ntsunami and in optical fibres, nonlinear electrical lines, blood pressure waves, ferroelectric\nmaterials, ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, conducting polymers, Bose-Einstein\ncondensates, and perhaps DNA.\nThierry Dauxois and Michel Peyrard have put together an extensive monograph de-\nscribing the mathematical physics of solitons. Their book consists of 16 chapters grouped\ninto four Parts, plus appendices. The text opens with a friendly and interesting intro-\nduction to motivate the reader and set the context. The four chapters of Part I cover\n1\nPublished in Contemp. Phys. 47, 235-236 (2006).\nrespectively nontopological solitons and the KdV equation, topological solitons and the\nsine-Gordon equation, the nonlinear Schro\u00a8dinger equation, and ion-acoustic waves in a\nplasma as an example of soliton modelling. Part II consits of three chapters giving an\naccount of the mathematical methods available for treating solitons. There are seven chap-\nters in Part III dealing with a diversity of different applications (and possible applications)\nof solitons. These include respectively: the 1955 Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) paradox, which\nwas instrumental in stimulating the rediscovery and modern understanding of solitons;\ndislocations in crystals; ferroelectric domain walls; incommensurate phases; magnetic sys-\ntems; conducting polymers; and Bose-Einstein condensates. There are just two chapters\nin Part IV discussing the possible role of solitons in energy localisation\/transfer in pro-\nteins, and in the statistical physics of DNA. The three appendices provide respectively a\nderivation of the KdV equation for surface hydrodynamic waves, a synopsis of the main\nresults of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics for continuous media (which is where,\nin practice, most systems soliton-like excitations arise), and a discussion of the coherent\nstates of a harmonic oscillator. The text is very well-written, albeit with slightly too\nmany exclamation marks, and should be accessible to a wide readership.\nJust before the appendices there is a reflective Conclusion addressing directly the\nquestion of whether or not physical solitons can really be considered to exist \u2013 which\nin a sense is a philosophical problem. The discussion is motivated by the \u201coverselling\u201d\nof solitons by certain enthusiasts, and by the resultant critical reactions by sceptics.\nThe problem, as the authors point out, is that the equations describing real physical\nsystems are not precisely of soliton form, but may include extra terms. Consequently, their\nbehaviour is soliton-like, rather than being precisely of the form predicted for idealised\nmathematical solitons. The authors discuss the issue sensitively and cautiously. In doing\nso, they point out that in treating real systems a choice may sometimes exist between\nusing a linear model and then adding extra terms to reflect reality, or modelling with\nsolitons and, again, adding some extra terms. They suggest, persuasively, that may be\nmany instances where the latter aproach is the more appropriate and revealing.\nA great deal of care and attention to detail has gone into making Physics of Solitons\nattractive and interesting on many levels. There are pictures and short vignettes of a\ndozen of the scientists whose work is featured in the book, including e.g. Davydov, de\nVries, Fermi, Korteweg and Tsingou, as well as John Scott Russell himself. The many\n2\nillustrations and figures have full and helpful captions, and there are striking photographs\nof some natural solitons such as internal waves on the Andaman Sea. There is an extensive\n(though select) bibliography. The authors have taken the opportunity of setting the\nhistorical record straight for Mary Tsingou who performed the computing (on MANIAC\nat Los Alamos) that led to the discovery of the celebrated FPU paradox, but who was\nnot included in the authorship of the famous paper that resulted from her work.\nThe authors stress that \u201cThe book does not claim to be exhaustive\u201d, which is rea-\nsonable given the enormous literature on solitons. Nonetheless it is a substantial and\ncarefully considered work with a broad coverage. It seems to me ideal as an introduction\nto the field for undergraduate or postgraduate physicists, or for any numerate scientist\nwho wishes to learn something about solitons, and it can be recommended very warmly\nto them all.\nPeter V.
