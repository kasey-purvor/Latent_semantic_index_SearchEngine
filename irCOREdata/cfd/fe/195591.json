One strand of this work has involved collaboration with voluntary sector organizations in helping offenders into education training and employment (ETE). Underlying this work is a slim but important evidence base, which shows that offending diminishes when offenders gain employment, and that being in work may trigger longer term desistance. \\ud\n\\ud\nDrawing on an evaluation of a government-sponsored `Employment Pathfinder' and on other relevant research, the article argues that recent governmental pressure to contract out services, and to adhere to certain `what works in reducing re-offending' principles, has given rise to tension within this collaboration attributable to conflicting ideology and practice.

One strand of this work has involved collaboration with voluntary sector \norganizations in helping offenders into education training and employment (ETE). \nUnderlying this work is a slim but important evidence base, which shows that \noffending diminishes when offenders gain employment, and that being in work may \ntrigger longer term desistance.  \nDrawing on an evaluation of a government-sponsored 'Employment Pathfinder' and \non other relevant research, the article argues that recent governmental pressure to \ncontract out services, and to adhere to certain 'what works in reducing re-offending' \nprinciples, has given rise to tension within this collaboration attributable to conflicting \nideology and practice. Specifically, this has created a context in which there is limited \nscope to adopt practices which are informed by knowledge about 'what works' in \ngetting people into employment. A less prescriptive approach from the centre about \nwhat should be delivered, and how, would restore effective teamwork and might also \nopen up probation practice to empirical and theoretical insights into the desistance \nprocess. Wider implications of these findings for the future involvement of \norganizations with expertise in the provision of services for offenders are discussed.  \n \nKey Words: desistance \u2022 employment schemes \u2022 partnership \u2022 what works  \n \nIntroduction \nThe Government's Effective Practice Initiative (EPI) in England and Wales sought  to  \npilot  a  range  of  interventions  for  those  in  prison  and  under probation \nsupervision, which were designed to reduce re-offending (Furniss and Nutley,  \n2000).  This work  became  more  widespread  and  gathered  speed  as it was \nabsorbed into the multi-million pound Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) \n(Hedderman, 2004). The interventions trialled were said to be based on  the  'What  \nWorks'  literature  but,  arguably,  they  prioritized  some  so-called  'What  Works  \nprinciples'\u2014such  as  ensuring  programmes  were  delivered  exactly  as  they  were  \ndesigned  ('programme  integrity')\u2014over  other important  elements,  such  as  \ncareful  targeting  and  ensuring  that  delivery matched   offenders'   learning   styles   \n('responsivity')   (Hedderman,   2004, 2007). In a review of this literature conducted \nbefore the EPI commenced, it was  noted  that,  important  though  the  principles  \nwere,  they  did  not  offer  a blue-print to follow about how to manage or deliver \nservices (Vennard and Hedderman, 1998).  \nThe  results  of  a  number  of  the  evaluations  conducted  to  assess  the  EPI\/ \nCRP 'Pathfinders' are now available. 1 They show rather mixed results. Few of  these  \nstudies  suggest  the  underlying  approaches  are  flawed,  but  most comment  on  \nproblems  with  delivery. 2  In  particular,  inflated  government targets led to \nunsuitable referrals, high proportions of potential clients failed to  attend,  there  was  \npoor  record  keeping  and  high  staff  turnover  led  to  a stop-start  approach.  In  \nthe  case  of  the  first  Employment  Pathfinder  there were  problems  with  \ninconsistent  assessments,  overloading  offenders  with requirements  and  \ninsufficient  tailoring  of  responses  to  individual  need  (see Haslewood-Pocsik et \nal., 2004). A key recommendation was that 'offending and  employment  should  not  \nbe  considered  as  two  independent  facets  of offenders' lives, which can be \nviewed and dealt with separately' (Haslewood-Pocsik et al., 2004: 65). The authors \nalso recommended that a second phase of  the  Pathfinder  should  involve  the  \neducation,  training  and  employment (ETE) partnership organizations to a greater \ndegree in planning and implementation in order to improve communication and joint \nworking.  \nThis article draws on some of the results of the evaluation of the second phase   of   \nthe   Employment   Pathfinder   (EP2)   (Hedderman   and   Vennard, 2008).  We  \nfocus  in  particular  on  the  advantages  of  involving  those  who understand  'what  \nworks'  in  getting  people  into  employment,  and  explore the  difficulties  ETE  \nproviders  experienced  in  applying  this  knowledge  in  a context bound by \nexpectations about 'what works' in reducing re-offending. We  argue  that,  while  \nevidence  of  'what  works'  in  reducing  offending  (and why)  has  a  place  in  the  \ndesign  and  delivery  of  employment  initiatives,  an overly prescriptive approach \ninhibits flexibility in responding to the needs of individual  offenders.  A  centralizing  \ntendency,  it  will  be  argued,  has  eroded what  was  once  perceived  by  ETE  \nexperts  as  genuine  partnership  with  the Probation Service.  \n \nThe link between unemployment and offending  \nOffenders are far more likely than non-offenders to have experienced long-term \nunemployment  (Mair  and  May,  1997;  NACRO,  1999).  According to  the  Social  \nExclusion  Unit  (SEU,  2002),  over  two-thirds  of  prisoners  are unemployed  at  \nthe  time  of  imprisonment\u2014around  13  times  the  national unemployment  rate.  \nThree-quarters  of  prisoners  do  not  have  paid  employment  to  go  to  on  release  \nfrom  custody;  and  over  half  of  offenders  subject to community sentences are \nunemployed at the start of their orders (Home Office, 2004). There are a number of \nreasons for these high rates of unemployment. A criminal record itself creates a \nbarrier to employment, but also the majority of offenders lack skills and qualifications \nand have a poor work history. In one study approximately 40 per cent of a sample of \noffenders on community orders who were unemployed had basic skills deficits \n(McMahon et al., 2004). Most offenders will also be handicapped by a number of \nother social and personal problems including homelessness, debt, poor health and \nsubstance abuse (Fletcher et al., 1998; Metcalf et al., 2001).  \nThe association between unemployment and high rates of re-offending is also well \nestablished (Crow et al., 1989; Simon and Corbett, 1996; May, 1999; McGuire, \n2002). Conversely, the extent and frequency of their offending  diminishes  when  \noffenders  gain  employment  (Farrington  et  al.,  1986; Sarno et al., 2000). What is \nless clear is how unemployment and offending are  related  and,  in  turn,  how  they  \ninteract  with  other  personal  and  social problems (e.g. Tarling, 1982).  \n \nReducing re-offending through employment initiatives: What works?  \nA recent review of studies of efforts to reduce re-offending through rehabilitative \ninterventions (Bonta and Andrews, 2007) endorsed the core principles, espoused by \nthe Effective Practice Initiative (Chapman and Hough, 1998), which  have  influenced  \nprobation  policy  and  practice  over  the  last decade. These are: matching  \ninterventions to level of risk; targeting needs that are most directly  related  to  \noffending;  drawing  on  cognitive-behavioural  methods; tailoring  interventions  to  \nmotivation,  learning  style  and  the  abilities  and strengths  of  the  offender;  \naddressing  multiple  problems  in  a  co-ordinated way  through  multi-agency  \npartnership;  and  ensuring  that  programmes  are delivered as designed. However, \nas a number of commentators have observed, the development of structured group \nprogrammes has been characterized by a  relatively  narrow  focus  on  cognitive  \nbehavioural  models  of  change,  with too  little  regard  to  theoretical  and  empirical  \ninsights  into  what  prompts and  sustains  desistance  from  offending  (e.g.  \nMcNeill,  2006;  Maguire  and Raynor, 2006). The 'what works' focus on formal \ninterventions has also been criticized for paying too little attention to the importance \nof the traditional 'relational' model of supervision in which practitioners' interpersonal \nskills were highly valued (e.g. Raynor, 2004; Robinson, 2005).  \nCertain insights from the growing literature on desistence from offending are of \nparticular relevance to the question of whether, and if so, how employment services \ncan facilitate this process. A key theme of the research is that readiness to stop \noffending is brought about by the interplay between individual choice and wider \nsocial forces (e.g. Farrall and Bowling, 1999: 261). Acquiring new social bonds or \nstrengthening existing ones (most commonly in relation to family and employment) \ncan create a 'stake in conformity', but research has shown that one of the keys to \ndesistance is a person's subjective assessment of the significance of such changes. \nFarrall (2002), for example, stresses  that  offenders  need  to  feel  that  they  have  \nacquired  something  that they value more highly than any benefits derived from a \ncriminal lifestyle (see also  Burnett  and  Maruna,  2004;  McNeill  and  Maruna,  \n2008).  If securing employment does initiate a re-evaluation of a person's life it is \nlikely to trigger a readiness to adopt a new value system and a pro-social identity \nwhich, in turn, may result in long-term desistance (Maruna, 2001; Farrall, 2002).  \nAchieving   such   a   transition   can,   however,   be   a   protracted   process. \nDesistance studies have shown that it is characterized as a progression from \noffence-free periods in the course of a criminal career to a point at which a person \nbegins to assume the identity of a law-abiding citizen (e.g. Maruna, 2001;  Maruna  \nand  Farrall,  2004).  The  research  highlights  the  importance of  significant  others,  \nsuch  as  probation  supervisors,  in  helping  to  sustain motivation,  overcome  \nobstacles  and  resist  pressure  to  revert  to  a  criminal lifestyle  (e.g.  Rex,  1999;  \nDowden  and  Andrews,  2004;  Robinson,  2005).  \nContinuity within a one-to-one relationship can support an offender's own efforts  to  \novercome  'setbacks  and  disillusionment'  (Maguire  and  Raynor, 2006: 28-9). \nFurther, desistance studies suggest that a collaborative 'client-centred'  approach,  in  \nwhich  a  practitioner  and  offender  mutually  agree goals and tasks, can help build \n'human capital' or capacity to change, such as enhanced skills and qualifications \n(e.g. Farrall, 2002; McNeill, 2006).  \nWhile   the   value   of   the   supervisory   relationship   and   'individualizing'  \nresponses  to  offenders  is  acknowledged  in  more  recent  policy  documents \nconcerning offender management (e.g. NOMS, 2006), this stops well short of  \nadvocating  a  genuinely  client-centred  approach.  It  also  remains  to  be seen just \nhow far even the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) model can be \nrealized when so much of the day-to-day work is parcelled out to 'key workers'. \nMoreover, those key workers who run existing accredited programmes  have  very  \nlittle  scope  to  adapt  the  material  or  the  mode  of delivery  to  the  range  of  \nlearning  needs  and  differing  levels  of  engagement they are likely to encounter \n(Annison, 2006).  \nAs Farrall (2002) and others have argued, as well as building capacity for change, \nthose who work with offenders must also help to build 'socialcapital', or opportunities \nto access mainstream opportunities. Crucially, if offenders are to benefit from work-\nfocused support and training it must be geared to local job opportunities and skills \nshortages. Recognition of the need to work with  employers  is  evident  in  at  least  \ntwo  recent  expressions  of  government policy and priorities (Home Office et al., \n2005, 2006). The second of these documents, Reducing Re-Offending through Skills \nand Employment: Next Steps, stresses the importance of engaging with employers \nin designing and delivering programmes so that they are more closely aligned to \ntheir needs.  Additionally, working with employers, it is suggested, may break down \nreal and perceived barriers to employing offenders.  The  report  also  argues  that  \nraising  levels  of  employment  offers  a  sustainable  route  out  of  poverty  and \ndependence  on  welfare  benefits  for  offenders  and  their  families  (see  also \nLeitch Review, 2005).  \nWhile it is clear that employment interventions can help offenders develop work-\nrelated  skills  and  find  suitable  work,  there  is  little  evidence  about which \nparticular aspects of ETE practice increase the prospects of sustained employment. \nA recent review of the available evidence revealed an absence of important detail \nabout their duration, intensity and content, while most studies that employed \nquantitative techniques have lacked a comparison group (Hurry et al., 2006). \nMoreover, disentangling the impact of ETE initiatives from help received in relation to \nother needs is problematic. Subject to these caveats, the limited research base does \nprovide support for two of the key 'what works' principles noted above\u2014namely, that \nin seeking to move offenders  into  work  it  is  important  to  match  the  intervention  \nto  individual circumstances and level of motivation, and to address the full range of \ntheir needs.  An earlier review of the international literature on  the  employment of \noffenders (Haslewood -Pocsik et al., 2004) similarly highlighted the benefits  of  an  \nindividualized  service  that  is  responsive  to  diversity  in  the  characteristics of \nunemployed offenders.  \nThese  findings  chime  with  research  evidence  of  'what  works'  in  helping \nunemployed, low-qualified adults who are not disadvantaged by a criminal record  \ninto  work.  Here again,  improving  'job-readiness'  requires  an  approach that is \ntailored to individual circumstances and level of motivation, while also combining \neducational and vocational input with broader-based support, for example help with \nfinances and personal development (Dench et al., 2006). \n While it may be appropriate for specialist ETE agencies working in collaboration with \nthe Probation Service to pay attention to levels of motivation, confidence  and  self-\nesteem  as  well  as  skills  deficits,  it  is  clear  that  they  are not  equipped  (or  \nfunded)  to  address  wider  personal  and  social  barriers  to employment.  Studies  \nof  employment  schemes  for  offenders  underline  the central  role  of  the  \nsupervisor\/offender  manager  in  ensuring  that  work  on skills  and  employment  is  \nwell  integrated  with  other  interventions  (Sarno et al., 2000; Webster et al., 2001). \nWhere there are several areas of need probation  staff  are  likely  to  prioritize  some  \nof  these\u2014typically  drug  treatment and housing\u2014above ETE (McSweeney and \nHough, 2006).  \nJust as desisting from offending can be a protracted process, the research evidence  \nunderlines  the  fact  that  moving  into  work  is,  for  many  offenders, a long term \ngoal which is unlikely to be achieved in one short programme. Those with \nentrenched employment problems and a poor work history are likely to need longer \nand more intensive support from supervisors and ETE specialists  (Haslewood-\nPocsik  et  al.,  2004).  Yet  where  attendance  at  an ETE  programme  is  voluntary,  \nmotivation  to  attend  can  be  poor  and  many offenders  drop  out  at  an  early  \nstage  (Hurry  et  al.,  2006).  Consequently, as we shall illustrate with reference to \nan evaluation of the second Employment Pathfinder,  ETE  providers  perceive  \nthemselves  as  having  to  adapt their provision to the individual in order to \nencourage attendance at future appointments.   This   ethos,   we   will   argue,   is   \nincompatible   with   NOM's increasingly centralized approach to the design and \nprovision of services by the voluntary sector.  \nThe Probation Service-ETE collaboration: Conflicting philosophy and practice  \nAlthough the Probation Service has traditionally worked with both statutory and non-\nstatutory agencies at local level, as Rumgay (2007: 543) observed, since the early \n1990s such activity has been characterized by central directive rather than local \ninitiative. This may be seen in the Government's adoption of the cross-departmental \nresponse to re-offending recommended by the Social Exclusion Unit (SEU, 2002), \nwhich stresses the need for all key departments and  service  agencies  to  act  in  \npartnership.  For  example,  the  Reducing  Re-Offending  National  Action  Plan  \n(Home  Office,  2004)  identified  a  number of  'pathways'  forward  with  education,  \ntraining  and  employment  (ETE)  as one of the key sets of needs to be addressed.1  \nAt the local level probation services have worked in partnership with ETE advisers  \nfor  some  years  in  seeking  to  improve  offenders'  prospects  of  gaining  \nemployment.  However,  funding  for  these  initiatives  has  been  criticized on  the  \ngrounds  that  it  is  usually  short  term,  output-driven  and  not  subject to  detailed  \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  (e.g.  Roberts  et  al.,  1997;  Sarno et al., 2000). In \n2001 funding was provided under the auspices of the Home Office Crime  Reduction  \nProgramme  to  conduct  an  employment-focused Pathfinder project in two \nprobation areas, with the explicit aim of reducing re-offending by improving offenders' \nemployability. Within the framework of the Reducing Re-Offending National Action \nPlan, a second phase of the Employment Pathfinder (EP2) was initiated in April 2004 \nin the original two probation  areas  and  in  five  others  in  order  to  examine  how  \nfar  problems identified in the first Employment Pathfinder had been resolved. As \nwith the first  phase,  those  targeted  by  EP2  were  either  on  licence  following  \nrelease from  custody  or  were  serving  a  community  sentence.  All  participants  \nwere thus subject to statutory probation supervision.  \nThe evaluation on which this article is based (Hedderman and Vennard, 2008)   was   \nconducted   in   2006.   Data   were   gathered   from   a   number   of sources, \nincluding: information contained in a central database; locally held case files; and \ninterviews with those involved in delivering and participating in EP2.  Programme \nmanagers in all seven areas were interviewed.  In  four of  the  areas  interviews  \nwere  also  conducted  with:  15  offender  managers  and  other  probation  staff  \nwho  were  involved  in  delivering  EP2;  12  ETE providers, including two senior \nmembers of Jobcentre Plus with experience of   working   in   partnership   with   the   \nProbation   Service.   In   addition,   32 offenders  referred  to  EP2  in  the  same  \nfour  areas  were  interviewed  about their  experience  of  EP2.  This  sample,  which  \nincluded  five  women,  ranged in  age  from  18  to  49.  The  interviewees  had  \nbeen  sentenced  in  respect  of a  variety  of  offences,  ranging  in  seriousness  \nfrom  shoplifting  to  murder. Just  over  half  were  serving  a  community  sentence,  \nthe  rest  were  on  licence having  completed  a  custodial  sentence.  Despite  \nattempts  to  include  in  the interview  sample  some  offenders  who  had  dropped  \nout  of  the  scheme,  it proved  impossible  to  contact  anyone  who  was  no  longer  \nin  contact  with the Probation Service. This meant that the sample was biased \ntowards those who  were  still  participating  in  EP2,  although  we  achieved  \ninterviews  with four  participants  who  had  completed  the  programme,  or  had  \nleft  before completion, having taken up employment or work-related training. The \nPathfinder comprised two components. The first was a group-work programme\u2014\n'WorkWise'\u2014designed   to   enhance   motivation   to   improve work-related skills \nand to seek employment.  The  second  took  the  form  of nine modules providing \nemployment-related knowledge and skills, including how  to  disclose  previous  \nconvictions  to  potential  employers,  writing  a  CV and communication skills. EP2 \nwas designed to provide a substantial element of partnership between the Probation \nService and specialist voluntary sector ETE providers of local employment and \ntraining services. In most areas the initiative formalized existing, sometimes \nlongstanding, partnerships  with charitable organizations.  \nPrior to EP2, arrangements for assessing needs and deciding the content of \nemployment-related work had been negotiated informally at the local level between \nprobation and ETE providers. This approach was compatible with  ETE  experts'  \npreferred  method  of  working,  which  places  a  premium on  establishing  rapport,  \ngaining  trust  and  responding  to  the  individual's needs  and  learning  style.  \nFollowing  the  implementation  of  EP2,  however, the designers of EP2\u2014the \nNational Probation Directorate (NPD)\u2014required all seven Pathfinder areas to adopt \na standardized method of assessing needs and  to  adhere  to  a  manual  detailing  \nwhat  was  to  be  covered  in  each  of  the 10 WorkWise sessions and nine \nmodules. Providers had discretion to deliver one or more modules according to an \noffender's needs, but it was anticipated that  actually  seeking  employment  would  \noccur  only  after  the  offender  had completed other elements designed to improve \ntheir 'job readiness'.  \nThe   main   reasons   for   such   a   top-down,   prescriptive   approach   were \ntwofold.  First,  the  NPD  wished  to  ensure  that  the  two  components  of  EP2 \nwere  delivered  to  a  consistently  high  standard  in  all  areas.  Second, for \nevaluation purposes, standardization of programme content and method of delivery  \nwas  seen  as  necessary  in  order  to  measure  the  effectiveness  of  the \nprogramme and examine performance in each area against centrally imposed \ntargets. As observed by Raynor (2004: 202) structured programmes have the \nimportant advantage that they enable researchers to gather information on 'what is \nactually being done, with whom, and for how long'. The prescribed nature of EP2 \nalso reflects a wider view within government that poor implementation  is  one  of  \nthe  main  reasons  rehabilitative  work  with  offenders appears to have had limited \nimpact on reconviction rates. As noted earlier, there is some empirical evidence from \nevaluations of the Government's CRP Pathfinders to support this view. In a recent \nreview of the international literature  on  offender  risk  assessment,  Bonta  and  \nAndrews  (2007)  note  that  a gap  in  effectiveness  between  the  controlled,  \nexperimental  setting  and  'real world'  interventions  is  most  likely  due  to  a  \ndecline  in  the  quality  and  integrity of service delivery. Similarly, in a review of \n'what works' Harper and Chitty (2005) argue that one reason recent evaluations of \ninterventions with offenders have provided mixed results on effectiveness is that \nwhat is implemented locally does not always match the original design.2   \nHowever,  where  programmes  are  designed  in  such  a  way  as  to allow little  or  \nno  flexibility  in  the  content  of  an  intervention  and  in  the  manner of delivery this \ninhibits the exercise of discretion on the part of experienced and  skilled  \npractitioners.  It is important to bear in mind that these were agencies with \nexperience in delivering ETE services to offenders. Staff were highly trained and \nadhered to accredited national standards for the management and delivery of \nservices.3 From their perspective the EP2 model unduly restricted  professional  \nautonomy.  As one member of staff observed: 'Our staff are trained advice and \nguidance workers. This is surely why we're contracted  into  probation,  because  we  \nare  trained  at  what  we  do.  So why are probation trying to tell us how to do our \njobs?' (ETE co-ordinator).   \nIf they  were  to  improve  participants'  employment  prospects,  advisers were \nstrongly of the opinion that they needed to move outside the straightjacket of 'off the \npeg' modules in order to respond effectively to the needs of individual offenders. \nPrior to EP2 they had offered a tailored approach, which typically involved working \nthrough the learning and skills encompassed by the modules, but in a more informal \nway and at a brisker pace (each module took approximately half an hour to deliver) \nin order to sustain interest and motivation. It was also common practice to run the \nlearning and skills element  in  parallel  with  efforts  to  find  employment.  Advisers \nargued that it was often preferable to tackle several employment issues \nsimultaneously, for example, conducting a 'job search' while creating a CV or \nadvising on how to disclose convictions to prospective employers. This ensured that \noffenders saw the relevance of the modules and could immediately practise their \nnew skills.  Such  an  approach  accords  with  evidence  of  effective  practice  in  \nthe provision  of  training  and  education  to  unemployed,  low-qualified  adults \n(Dench et al., 2006). It is also clear from interviews conducted with offenders in  the  \ncourse  of  the  EP2  evaluation  that  this  approach  was  effective,  not least  \nbecause  they  tended  not  to  see  the  value  of  learning  job  seeking  skills at the \ninitial appointment. From the outset, they expected and wanted ETE advisers to \nfocus on helping them gain employment.  Hence the emphasis placed  by  advisers  \non  the  need  for  incentives\u2014such  as  demonstrating  that they were making efforts \nto secure work or training\u2014if offenders were to be persuaded of the benefits of \nattending future appointments.  \nSimilarly, those who designed WorkWise underestimated the difficulty in achieving \nand retaining viable numbers of offenders to run the programme effectively.  Even  \nthough  EP2  had  been  operational  for  two  years  by  the time  of  our  evaluation,  \nWorkWise  had  seldom  been  delivered\u2014and  was even  less  often  completed\u2014\nwithin  a  group  setting.  Of  257  participants included  in  the  case  file  sample  \nonly  37  (14%)  were  considered  suitable for  the  programme,  26  of  whom  came  \nfrom  a  rural  area  in  north  Wales where  tutors  sometimes  delivered  the  \nprogramme  on  a  one-to-one  basis.  One  area  tackled  the  problem  of  poor  \nattendance  by  delivering  WorkWise in  probation  hostels,  but  since  there  was  \nlittle  effort  to  assess  suitability among hostel residents completion rates were \nmodest (50%). Given that the programme  was  to  be  targeted  on  offenders  who  \nwere  not  well  motivated to  find  employment,  in  the  absence  of  incentives  high  \nattrition  rates  were perhaps inevitable. 4 Commenting on what many perceived as a \nparadox at the heart of WorkWise, one programme manager observed: 'You're \nasking people  to  come  to  a  programme  that  requires  a  fair  amount  of  \nmotivation and organization whereas it's aimed at people who have no motivation \nand personal organization.'  \nThe programme was also unsuitable for offenders with low literacy skills or  who  \nwere  unable  to  cope  with  the  demands  of  a  lengthy  group-work programme. \nTutors were critical of the highly specified design and constant time  pressure,  which  \nleft  minimal  scope  to  tailor  the  sessions  to  individual needs,  to  alter  the  pace  \nor  to  respond  to  questions  and  concerns.  These same  criticisms  had  been  \nexpressed  by  tutors  who  delivered  the  10  session group-work programme in \nPhase One of the Pathfinder (Haslewood-Pocsik et al., 2004). The assumption \nunderlying the programme\u2014that unemployed offenders  are  a  generic  group  with  \nsimilar  problems  and  needs\u2014proved  to be unfounded. Some respondents likened \nthe WorkWise material to existing offending behaviour programmes, with its \nemphasis on improving thinking skills,  problem  solving  and  learning  appropriate  \nways  of  behaving  within a  work  context.  While  this  approach  worked  well  for  \noffenders  who  were keen to take advantage of what the programme had to offer, for \nthe majority who  were  referred  to  EP2  the  task  of  addressing  poor  motivation  \nfell  to the  ETE  advisers.  It was their perception that offenders were sometimes \nreferred  before  they  were  'ready'  to  engage  with  efforts  to  move  them  into \nemployment. Hence, the advisers emphasized the importance of establishing rapport \nwith an offender at the first appointment through a combination of interpersonal  \nskills,  looking  for  suitable  employment  from  the  outset  and crucially,  ensuring  \nthat  the  service  user  felt  a  sense  of  'ownership'  of  the targets and action plan:  \nTo  me  the  success  of  any  work  that  we  do  with  probation  is  down  to  \nthe advisers  and  their  ability  to  engage  the  offenders.  You  can  provide  \nany number  of  modules  but  the  employability  skills  that  they  teach  \nanyone can learn. It's the qualities that people bring to the work. (ETE \nmanager)  \nThey  [service  users]  need  to  feel  that  they're  getting  something  now;  \nthe advisers have to give them a reason to come back. (ETE adviser)  \nFrom  the  moment  we  assess  someone  we  start  thinking  about  what  \nwould suit  them let's  look  at  job  search,  what's  on  the  JobCentre  Plus  \nwebsite, let's look in the newspapers. (ETE adviser)  \nPeople learn more if they feel they are getting the answers themselves rather \nthan being given them.  If  they  are  given  everything  they  tend  to  glaze  \nover a  bit.  I  think  it's  important  that  they  take  ownership  and \nresponsibility  for their  learning.  The  parts  of  the  programme  that  allow  \nthis  I  really  enjoy. (WorkWise tutor)  \nThese   views   underline   the   limitations   of   the   EP2   modular   structure in  \ntackling  poor  motivation  and  the  key  role  that  the  advisers  played  in \nencouraging  offenders  to  become  actively  involved  in  efforts  to  improve their  \nemployability.  This  approach  is  consistent  with  the  understanding that \ndesistance can be triggered if offenders begin to take responsibility for decisions  \nabout  their  future  rather  than  perceiving  themselves  as  passive recipients  of  \ninterventions  (Rex,  1999;  Dowden  and  Andrews,  2004).  The importance   ETE   \nadvisers   attached   to   the   inter-personal   aspect   of   their work  with  offenders  \naccords  with  the  theory  that  such  relationships  can promote  desistance  by  \nhelping  to  build  both  'human  capital'\u2014capacity to  change\u2014and  opportunities  to  \nlead  a  crime-free  lifestyle  (Farrall,  2002, 2004).  Moreover,  although  it  was  not  \nexplicit  in  the  advisers'  descriptions of  their  approach,  it  could  be  argued  that  \ntheir  ethos  was  in  accordance with  a  'strengths-based'  (rather  than  needs-\nbased)  model  of  desistance,  in which emphasis is placed upon offenders' skills, \nresources and assets rather than  their  level  of  risk  and  criminogenic  needs  (e.g.  \nMaruna  et  al.,  2004; McNeill, 2006). At the same time, ETE advisers stressed the \nimportance of being realistic in their aspirations; their approach was to focus on \ndeveloping skills which matched their clients' capabilities and that enabled them to \ntake advantage of local labour shortages.  \nThe offenders whom we interviewed responded positively to this style of working. \nSeveral interviewees compared ETE advisers favourably with probation officers in \nterms of their ability to motivate them to tackle the barriers to employment and \ndisengage  from  crime.  These  offenders  valued  the  collaborative,  non-\njudgemental  manner  adopted  by  the  advisers  and  spoke of  having  gained  in  \nconfidence,  for  example,  in  approaching  prospective employers and responding \nto questions about their criminal record:  \nMale,  27,  on  licence  having  served  a  prison  sentence  for  supplying  \nClass  A drugs and involved in voluntary work at the time of interview: She's \nprofessional but she makes you know that she does care that makes me see \nthat somebody's  actually  interested  and  that  gives  you  a  bit  of  \nconfidence  and  a bit more belief to keep on pushing.  \n \nMale,  47,  on  licence  having  served  a  prison  sentence  for  involvement  \nin supplying  Class  A  drugs.  At  interview  he  had  just  obtained  \nemployment:  I was  so  impressed  with  how  he  didn't  care  who  I  was  or  \nwhat  I'd  done.  He didn't patronize me. He told me how it was. He just wants \nto see you not go back into prison and do all right.  \nRespondents   appreciated   the   encouragement   they   received   to   keep \napplying  for  posts  and  not  become  disheartened  or  de-motivated  if  they were  \nnot  offered  an  interview.  Regular  appointments  with  the  EP2  adviser could also \nprovide focus and help overcome inertia:  \nMale,  27,  serving  a  community  sentence  for  possession  of  a  bladed  \narticle, unemployed  but  training  to  become  a  bus  driver:  If  I  wasn't  \ncoming  down here and seeing [the EP2 tutor] and he wasn't putting me \nthrough and forward to contacts, I'd be a lot more lazier \uf0bc because I've got \nthe appointments to go to it forces me and pushes me to get into the \nemployment, which is good, 'cause I do want to work and I know I'd be lazy.  \nETE  managers  and  staff  considered  that  regular  appointments  with  the same  \nadviser  were  essential  in  building  trust  and  achieving  continuity  in working  with  \nan  offender.  Here again there is evidence to support such an approach.  Recent \nresearch on different  models  of  case  management  on  the part of probation \nsupervisors concluded that offenders are more inclined to trust their case manager \nand ask for help if they see the same person over a period of time (Partridge, 2004). \nPartridge (2004: 9) reports that offenders with  experience  of  different  models  of  \nsupervision  'were  unanimous  about the  importance  of  contact  with  the  same  \ncase  manager,  particularly  during the  initial  stages  of  supervision'.  Interestingly,  \nwhile  Partridge's  research may have informed the NOMS concept of offender \nmanagers, in the current study  it  was  ETE  advisers  rather  than  offender  \nmanagers  whom  offenders described in this way.  \nIn  fulfilling  this  role,  it  was  clear  that  ETE  advisers  were  accustomed  to \nproviding advice and guidance falling outside the topics covered by modular design  \nof  EP2.  Examples  were  given  of  offenders  who  looked  to  them  for help  with  \nproblems  that  were  not  strictly  employment-related,  but  needed to  be  \nprioritized.  If  an  offender  mentioned  more  immediate  concerns\u2014for example in \nrelation to accommodation, debt or benefits\u2014respondents said that  they  would  \nattempt  to  address  these.  Such  a  broad-based  service  was not  envisaged  by  \nthose  who  commissioned  EP2.  The  wider  support  sought by  offenders  and  \nprovided  within  the  ambit  of  EP2  is  exemplified  in  the following extract from an \ninterview with an in-house tutor:  \nI spent an hour with him and we got his benefits changed and everything and \nI'm  still  working  with  him  and  it's  made  it  a  lot  easier  and  I  can  move  \nhim on to other programmes now that will eventually make him work ready but \nI was not delivering anything that was actually in EP2 so I can't actually say \nthat I've done any work on EP2.  \nWhile  these  findings  reflect  well  on  the  ETE  advisers,  they  suggest  that a  \nminority  of  probation  officers  may  not  be  as  effective  as  ETE  experts  in \nbuilding  on  and  developing  offenders'  strengths  and  helping  them  acquire new  \nskills  and  personal  attributes.  This  may  reflect  the  fact  that,  unlike ETE  \nproviders,  the  Probation  Service  must  look  to  public  protection  and cannot  \nfocus  exclusively  on  the  offender's  interests.  However, the findings raise the \nquestion of why, in the case of offenders with multiple needs, some probation  case  \nmanagers  appeared  not  to  be  addressing  these  directly,  or through   \npartnerships   with   other   agencies.   One   explanation,   mentioned by  members  \nof  the  probation  teams  involved  in  delivering  EP2,  is  that  a policy  of  \nautomatic  referral  of  unemployed  offenders\u2014imposed  from  the centre  in  order  \nto  achieve  target  numbers\u2014gave  rise  to  inappropriate  or premature  referrals  in  \nsome  of  the  Pathfinder  areas.  Pressure  to  achieve the  targets  was  such  that  \nsome  case  managers  conceded  that  they  referred offenders at an early stage in \nthe supervision order, with insufficient regard to other more pressing needs. Others \nresisted such a mechanistic approach, referring  offenders  to  EP2  relatively  \ninfrequently  and  screening  out  those who  appeared  unmotivated,  or  where  \npriority  needed  to  be  given  to  other problems.  \nMeeting  referral  and  employment  targets  proved  to  be  one  of  the  main points \nof tension between the architects of EP2 and the external providers of ETE services \n(and between probation staff and ETE advisers on the ground). Those  offender  \nmanagers  who  referred  indiscriminately  created  difficulties further  down  the  line  \nfor  their  ETE  partners,  whose  employment-focused performance  targets  were  \nunlikely  to  be  achieved  if  offenders  were  some way  from  being  'job-ready'.  As  \nMcSweeney  and  Hough  (2006)  observed, from  the  perspective  of  voluntary  \nsector  providers,  performance  targets are  a  source  of  anxiety  since  any  \nshortfall  could  jeopardize  future  funding. Low rates of employment among \noffenders reflect the fact that the majority have poor educational attainment and skills \nand are ill-equipped to compete with  non-offenders  for  a  limited  pool  of  suitable  \njobs.  Thus, while ETE advisers engaged in EP2 initiated job searches with some \noffenders as a way of  motivating  them,  they  regarded  the  targets  under  which  \nthey  operated as  unattainable  by  many  of  the  offenders  referred  to  them.  In \nsuch  cases, advisers saw the achievement of sustainable employment as a very \nlong term goal  and  perceived  their  role  principally  in  terms  of  moving  the  \noffenders towards  job-readiness  rather  than  directly  into  jobs  (see  also  \nMcSweeney and Hough, 2006). However, the employment targets did not give credit \nfor steps taken on the way towards employment, such as improvement in skills, self-\nconfidence and motivation to find work.  Such  'soft  outcomes'  are  not readily  \nencompassed  in  quantitative  measures  of  performance  (inputs  and outputs), or \nin centrally imposed employment targets.  \nLinking funding to achieving targets can be an effective way of managing \nperformance, but unless targets are realistic and reflect progression towards \nemployment they can have unintended consequences. ETE advisers engaged in  the  \nEP2  Pathfinder  tended  to  concentrate  their  resources  on  offenders who  were  \nmost  likely  to  find  work  rather  than  the  least  'job-ready'.  By the  same  token,  \nthey  were  discouraged  from  putting  effort  into  improving the  qualifications,  \nvocational  and  'soft'  skills  that  for  many  offenders  are essential  bridges  to  \nsustainable  employment.  The exclusion  from  the  EP2  targets of training \noutcomes also placed providers under pressure to secure jobs for offenders \nregardless of their motivation, skills and job-readiness. In the longer term this was \nlikely to be counter-productive.  \nThe reality of partnership  \nA  consistent  message  from  evaluations  of  programmes  such  as  EP2  is  that \nwhere  voluntary  sector  providers  of  services  for  offenders  are  dependent on  \nstatutory  funding,  genuine  partnership\u2014characterized  by  teamwork, recognition  \nof  the  respective  strengths  of  partner  organisations  and  effort towards  \nachieving  shared  goals\u2014is  very  hard  to  achieve  (Jacobson,  2004; Minkes et al., \n2005; McSweeney and Hough, 2006). Such funding arrangements,  particularly  \nthose  set  up  through  competitive  tendering,  set  out  the funder's objectives as \nthe ones which must be achieved. While those tendering may be invited to suggest \nalternative delivery plans, there is rarely scope to renegotiate goals and priorities. In \nthis context objectives are shared only in  the  sense  that  the  voluntary  sector  \npartner  is  contractually  required  to meet them. Even in the absence of a \ncontractual relationship, differences in ideology  and  approach  can  give  rise  to  \ntension,  as  was  well  illustrated  in  a study of partnership between voluntary drug \nagencies and Youth Offender Teams (YOTs). Minkes et al. (2005) observed that \ndrug agencies tended to prioritize client need, confidentiality, rapport and trust. In \ncontrast, YOTs, operating  within  a  framework  of  criminal  justice,  were  expected  \nto  focus on enforcement and prevention of re-offending. In the same vein, ETE \npersonnel  who  participated  in  EP2  perceived  themselves  to  be  more  'client- \ncentred' and less concerned with crime reduction goals than their Probation Service \ncounterparts.  \nHistorically, the voluntary sector has been less constrained by bureaucracy and \nperformance targets than the public sector and has therefore been better able  to  \nprovide  a  flexible,  client-centred  service  and  to  be  innovative  (Gill and  Mawby,  \n1990).  However, experienced ETE advisers involved  in  the EP2 employment \ninitiative spoke of an erosion of the partnership ethos that had once characterized \ntheir relationship with the Probation Service.  The contractual arrangements \nsurrounding the content and delivery of EP2 were perceived by these experts as well \nbeyond appropriate parameter-setting by the centre.  As has occurred in other areas \nin which the voluntary\/not- for-profit  sector  has  traditionally  had  a  significant  role,  \nETE  providers  are subject to increasing regulation and a more centralized style of \nmanagement.  Benson (2008: 5), founder of the new voluntary sector network the \nNational Coalition for Independent Action, argues that a culture of commissioning \nand procurement has undermined the independence of the voluntary sector while  \npushing  them  into  delivering  more  public  services,  effectively  as  an 'arm's-\nlength agency of the state'. Adherence to a national structure and style of  work  \nensures  that  an  initiative  is  implemented  consistently  as  designed, but  it  fails  \nto  respond  at  the  local  and  individual  level  to  diversity,  undervalues local \nexpertise and runs the risk of demoralizing front line staff.  \nThe  voluntary  sector  is  likely  to  continue  to  play  a  major  part  in  the provision  \nof  services  to  ex-offenders.  Indeed, in creating NOMS the Government  envisages   \nan   expansion   in   partnerships   between   the   statutory and  voluntary  sector  \nacross  a  range  of  services,  including  housing,  health care,   drug   treatment   \nand   ETE   provision   (NOMS,   2005).   In   principle, such  arrangements  enable  \nthose  with  multiple  needs  to  benefit  from  the diversity   of   skills   and \nexperience   within   the   voluntary   sector   (Gill   and  Mawby,  1990;  Hucklesby  \nand  Worrall,  2007).  In practice, the potential for friction between statutory funding \nbodies and the voluntary\/community sector  is  likely  to  increase  with  the  advance  \nof  the  NOMS  'contestability' programme.  If  they  are  to  secure  contracts  from  \nthe  statutory  sector  under the  new  'contestability'  rules,  the  voluntary  sector  \nwill  have  to  adapt  to a  competitive,  contract-driven  culture  with  few  incentives  \nfor  partnership effort that is not subject to rigorous performance measurement \n(McSweeney and  Hough,  2006;  Hucklesby  and  Worrall,  2007).  While  the  \nsector  can expect  a  degree  of  central  co-ordination  and  must  account  for  its  \nexpenditure,  such  a  climate  is  likely  to  undermine  the  benefits  associated  with \nvoluntary  provision  of  public  services.  As highlighted in the EP2 evaluation,  these  \ninclude  flexibility,  a  capacity  to  be  innovative,  responsivity  to individual  and  \nlocal  circumstances  and  the  freedom  to  devise  methods  of delivery that those \nwho are expert in their field deem appropriate.  \nConclusions  \nAlthough the precise nature of the relationship between unemployment and  crime  is  \nunclear,  there  is  some  evidence  that  helping  offenders  gain employment  \nreduces  their  re-offending.  As  we  have  illustrated,  the  scheme we  evaluated\u2014\nEP2\u2014was  designed  to  accord  with  certain  'what  works' principles that underpin \nProbation Service policy and practice, whereas the providers  of  ETE  services  are  \nguided  by  another  body  of  knowledge  about 'what works' in helping low skilled, \npoorly qualified adults into employment.  The dominance of the 'what works' with \noffenders model is such that much of the reason for involving ETE experts in work \nwith offenders is in danger of being lost. Yet the personalized approach favoured by \nETE professionals is compatible with studies of desistance from crime, which confirm \nthat there is an important 'human element' in work with offenders. It can also be said \nthat the principles underpinning the work of ETE providers\u2014which inform the \nGovernment's national Information Advice and Guidance (IAG) service for  adult  \nlearners  (DfES,  2003)\u2014are  consistent  with  a  model  of  desistance that focuses \non what offenders can achieve given help and encouragement to access mainstream \nopportunities. These principles underline the importance of raising aspirations, \nextending opportunities, examining needs jointly with the  client  and  providing  \nevidence  of  progress  and  achievement  (Quinton,  2006).  \nWorking   with   offenders   in   this   way   is   not   incompatible   with   the cognitive-\nbehavioural  approach  that  has  been  a  key  feature  of  probation practice  since  \nthe  1990s,  with  its  focus  on  changing  attitudes  to  criminal behaviour  and  \nenhancing  thinking  skills  and  motivation.  However, while both   ETE   and   \ncognitive-behavioural   programmes   adopt   what   Maguire and   Raynor   (2006)   \nhave   termed   a   'responsibility   model'   (characterized by choice, empowerment, \nself-determination,  etc.),  in  practice  cognitive- behavioural programmes for \noffenders have tended to emphasize risk, needs and  perceived  'deficits'  (Farrall,  \n2002).  As  exemplified  by  the  IAG  ethos, ETE  programmes  encourage  \nresponsibility,  choice  and  ownership  of  plans to improve skills and job prospects.  \nThe drive to ensure that programmes provided by the voluntary sector are delivered \nas designed and to the prescribed 'dosage' has wider implications for their future \ninvolvement in providing services for offenders. As we have observed, an overly \nprescriptive approach can inhibit the exercise of expertise and legitimate \nprofessional  judgement.  It can also demoralize and undermine  effective \npartnership  (Nellis,  2002).  Moreover, where national oversight  goes  beyond  \nparameter-setting  by  the  centre,  this  can  disregard  local diversity  and  override  \nthe  need  to  adapt  the  service  to  local  circumstances. As  argued  by  Nellis  \n(2002:  70)  'Everything  must  be  done,  every  target achieved\u2014everywhere\u2014in a \npre-specified period of time.'  \nThere  are  signs  that  the  architects  of  the  Government's  strategy  for  improving  \nskills  and  employment  among  offenders  have  begun  to  respond to  these  \nconcerns.  Recent  policy  pronouncements  signal  a  more  flexible approach,  \nwhich  recognizes  the  need  to  tailor  employment-related  support to an offender's \nneeds. This is particularly notable in the Next Steps strategy document, which, \nsignificantly, was jointly authored by the Departments for Education and Skills and \nfor Work and Pensions as well as the Home Office (Home Office et al., 2006). It is \nalso evident in the context of proposed new employability contracts, which  are  \nenvisaged  as  providing  'personalized learning'  and  'customized  packages'.  \nLearning is still conceived as highly work-focused,  but  the  strategy  conveys  \nrecognition  that  learning  extends beyond vocational training to wider skills\u2014\ndisclosure of convictions, literacy\/numeracy,  life-skills\u2014and  opportunities  to  \npractise  new  skills  through work experience. There are also signs that the need to \naddress poor motivation and lack of incentives among unemployed offenders is now \nrecognized. For example, the PS Plus prison-probation employment initiative \nincludes a structured motivational approach to support offenders during the transition \nfrom  custody  to  the  community  (Cole  et  al.,  2007).  Moreover, the  evaluation  of  \nPS  Plus  provides  a  more  meaningful  measurement  of  the  impact of  the  \nprogramme  than  with  EP2,  since  it  incorporates  recognition  of  the \nachievements of probation and ETE personnel in helping offenders overcome poor  \nmotivation  and  develop  marketable  skills,  even  if  they  are  not  'job-ready'  (Cole  \net  al.,  2007).  An  assessment  of  improvement  in  employability can  go  further  \nand  include  progression  in  learning  (e.g.  from  basic  skills to  a  vocational  \ncourse),  movement  from  complete  inactivity  to  voluntary work  and  participation  \nin  unpaid  employment  (Dench  et  al.,  2006).  If future  employment  work  with  \nthe  voluntary  sector  adopts  such  a  broad understanding of the role and impact of \nETE providers, it may be that some of  the  criticisms  expressed  by  ETE  experts  \nin  the  course  of  EP2  will  be addressed.  \nOur  findings  suggest,  however,  that  wider  concerns  about  the  erosion of  \ngenuine  partnership  between  the  funding  body  and  the  voluntary  sector \nprovider  will  be  more  difficult  to  resolve.  The  architects  of  the  National \nOffender  Management  Model  (NOMS,  2006:  45)  have  acknowledged  the \nimportance  of  this  issue,  calling  for  an  'environment  in  which  teamwork at the \nlevel of the individual offender can flourish'. Further, 'partners from outside  of  the  \nmain  correctional  services  need  to  feel  that  they  are  more than  simple  \ncontractors'  (NOMS,  2006:  45).  Such  an  aspiration  is  surely incompatible with \nthe centralizing tendencies of Government, exemplified in the NOMS (2008) \npurchaser-provider, target-driven model of partnership.  \n \nNotes  \nWe would like to thank all who facilitated our evaluation of the EP2 Pathfinder in the \nseven pilot areas, including probation staff, ETE providers and participants. We are \nalso very grateful to Jessica Prendergrast, Mega Arumugam and Melody Askari for \ntheir assistance with the fieldwork and transcription of interviews.  \n1 Strategy  Unit  (2003:  10)  advice  on  piloting  recommends  against  using terms  \nlike  'Pathfinder'  because  they  imply  that  success  is  certain  and  that such \nprojects are ' innovative exemplars rather than rigorous policy trials'. See \nHedderman (2004) on this and other problems that had to be faced in evaluating the \nEffective Practice Initiative.  \n2  See,  for  example,  the  evaluation  reports  on  basic  skills  (McMahon  et  al., \n2004),  resettlement  (Lewis  et  al.,  2003)  and  offending  behaviour  programmes \n(Hollin et al., 2002). \n3  Other  'pathways'  include  accommodation,  finance,  mental  and  physical health \nand substance abuse. Their delivery is to take place within the context of the NOMS \nconcept of a co-ordinated, holistic approach to inter-related needs.  \n4 In fact, the explanation for the complex and mixed messages from the CRP \nevaluations favoured by the Home Office Research, Development and Statistics \ndivision was not implementation failure, but failure on the part of the researchers to \nuse randomized control trials. This interpretation and the Home Office response\u2014\nimposition of strict control over the delivery of an intervention and a simplistic belief \nthat using randomized control trials will yield  simple  and  certain  research  \nresults\u2014has  been  widely  criticized  (see, for example, Hollin, 2008; Raynor, 2008).  \nReferences  \nAnnison, J.
