Introduction \nThe process in its simplest form involves a rotating consumable rod of coating material that is \nbrought in contact with the substrate under an axial pressure. The heat generated by friction is \nsufficient to generate a hot plasticized zone within the consumable rod and when the \nmechtrode is traversed over the substrate, the coating is deposited in the form of a layer \n(figure 1). \nInsert figure 1 \nThis process derives its importance from the need for very hard or corrosion resistant coatings \nthat can be applied to cheaper and tougher substrates in wide variety of material combinations \n[1]. An important distinction from other coating techniques is the absence of liquid phase, \nwhich subsequently results in negligible dilution [2]. The mechanical removal of the oxide \nfilms during the process by the scouring action of the formed plasticized layer is another \ndistinct feature of the friction surfacing process [3]. A wide variety of material combinations \nhave been tried ranging from Stainless Steels (austenitic & martensitic) to Nickel and Cobalt \nbased alloys, thereby emphasizing the usefulness of this novel technique [4]. However, the \nuse of friction surfacing process for new applications has been limited due to the difficulty of \nmonitoring and control of the process outputs (bond quality and coating dimensions) specified \nin most industrial requirements [5]. A variable that is considered to be the most significant \nand primarily responsible for the coating quality is the temperature at the bond interface [6]. \nThe variation of this temperature with thermo-physical properties (mechtrode and substrate) \nand substrate geometries result in a complex process response [7]. Empirical investigations \nare normally required to determine optimum parameters that will produce the required process \nresponse. \n \nThe approach adopted in industry for the selection of critical process parameters for new \ncoating materials and substrate geometry involves lengthy experimental work usually by \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nvarying one parameter at a time and observing the effect on the process response. Moreover; \nthe commercial implementation of this process is based on specially designed and developed \nmachines which limit the number of applications and require significant initial investment. \nFor the technology to expand and to be commercially viable the use of standard machines for \nthe friction surfacing process with a capability for processing a variety of substrate geometries \nand material combinations is required. Therefore, the purpose of the presented research was to \ninvestigate the use of standard CNC machine for the friction surfacing process and to \ndemonstrate the use of statistical techniques for the selection and optimisation of process \nparameters when designing new applications. \n \n2. Material and experimental methods \n2.1 Materials \nThe selected materials for substrate and mechtrode were Stainless Steel 316 and Stellite 6, \nrespectively. The Stellite 6 was selected as a coating material because of the specific \nrequirement of high impact wear resistance. The original Stellite was developed at the \nbeginning of the 20th century by Elwood Haynes and consisted of Co with Cr as the single \nalloying element [8]. Later, additions of W and Mo improved the wear characteristics and \nfurther modifications by adding Ni, Si and Mn developed other Stellites for use in high \ntemperature and high impact wear situations. The nominal composition of Stellite 6 (wt %) is \ngiven in Table 1. \nInsert table 1 \n2.2 Experimental Details \nThe experimental work on micro friction surfacing was conducted by adapting a CNC \nmachine for the purpose. The rotational speed (rpm), the feed rate of mechtrode (Vz) and the \ntraverse rate of the substrate (Vx) were the essential machine input parameters. The normal \nforce which is set directly on dedicated machines (for friction surfacing) was represented by \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nthe feed rate Vz of the mechtrode because of the specific requirements of the CNC controller. \nNormal force (Fn) and substrate temperatures at specific locations were the measurable in \nprocess parameters. Bond strength (s) and coating thickness (t) were the process outputs that \nwere measured after the completion of the run. The substrate geometry and its dimensions \n(mm) are shown in figure 2. The selected geometry allows the process response to be \ninvestigated on the basis of variation in substrate thickness. \nInsert figure 2 \nThe temperature measurements were taken by using thermocouples (K-type) positioned at the \nbottom surface of the substrate along the centreline in the traverse direction. The placement \nensured that the temperature profile was recorded on each part of the substrate (thick and thin \nsections) over the deposition length. The substrate shape and thermocouple locations are \nshown in figure 2.The force was measured by using Kistler, force and torque sensor. The \nsubstrate was fixed by means of a special cam locking mechanism that engaged the sides of \nthe substrate. A dedicated program was developed in the Labview software for data \nacquisition purposes. The bond strength was measured by the push off test as discussed in [5, \n9] and the coating thickness was measured by using coordinate measuring machine (CMM). \n \nThe experimental run started on the thick portion of the substrate with fixed parameters and \nhalf way through the run (over the thin section of the substrate) the parameters were changed. \nThe temperature was measured at four locations at the bottom surface of the substrate, and the \nmeasurements from the locations T1 & T2 (figure 2) were used in the analysis since these \nlocations were away from the touch down zone of the process and substrate transition area \n(change in substrate thickness). The T1 was used to determine the repeatability of temperature \nmeasurements, whereas the average force and the measured peak temperature (T2) during the \ndeposition phase were used to establish the relationships between process variables. The \nfigure 3 illustrates the measured force and temperature profiles during the process.  \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nInsert figure 3 \n2.3 Design of experiments \nThe (statistical) design of experiments (DOE) is an efficient procedure for planning \nexperiments so that the data obtained can be analyzed to yield valid and objective conclusions \n[10]. The task starts with identifying the input variables and the response (output) that is to be \nmeasured. For each input variable, a number of levels are defined that represent the range for \nwhich the effect of that variable is desired to be known.  \n \nThe experiments were designed against a three-level full factorial investigation (33 factorial \ndesigns), that required 27 runs in total to be performed. The reason for selecting three-level \ndesign was that the third level for a factor facilitates investigation of a quadratic relationship \nbetween the response and each of the factors [11]. The table 2 indicate the investigated factors \nand their corresponding levels against which the experimental design was prepared. \nInsert table 2 \nThe results from the full factorial investigation for the selected material combination and \nsubstrate geometry are shown in table 3. The parameters of traverse rate (Vx), feed rate (Vz) \nand rotational speed (RPM) were varied to investigate the process response of coating \nthickness (along the length of the deposit), coating regularity and bond strength. Whereas the \nnormal force and the temperature at the bottom surface of the substrate are variables which \nwere measured during the process. \nInsert table 3 \nThe term regularity corresponds to the standard formulated (table 4) based on the variation in \nthickness of the deposited layer. The coating regularity was introduced to monitor the \nvariation in coating thickness since the desired thickness on the component could only be \nachieved if the variation is small. \nInsert table 4 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n2.4 Response Surface Methodology \nResponse Surface Methodology (RSM) can be regarded as a collection of statistical and \nmathematical techniques useful for optimizing objective functions. The methodology is based \non approximation of the objective function by a low order polynomial on a small sub-region \nof the domain [12]. Given a response variable Y and k factors, X1,...,Xk, the main purpose of \nRSM is to find the combination of factor levels to achieve the optimal response. For \ncomputational convenience, the variables are usually converted to coded or design variables, \nx1,\u2026,xk, standardized so that the design centre is at the point (x1,\u2026,xk) = 0. Moreover it is \nassumed that the true response is a function of the levels of the k design variables, \u0192(x1, x2,\u2026, \nxk), called the true response function [13]. \nIn present work the RSM was applied to investigate\/study the effect of input variables on the \ncoating quality. Following the full factorial design, 27 values for each response were obtained \nand were used to estimate the coefficients of reduced and full second order models. Based on \nthe analysis the effects (main and interaction) that were statistically significant were included \nin the developed models. A quadratic response surface with design variable inputs x1 and x2 \nand output variable y was formulated as: \n215\n2\n24\n2\n132211 xxxxxxy o \u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2 +++++=  \nWhere y is the response function and \u03b2i (i = 0,\u2026,5) are the unknown coefficients that were \nestimated by least squares fitting of the model to the experimental results obtained at the \ndesign points. As in fitting any regression model, the analysis of the residuals from the fitted \nmodel is necessary to determine the adequacy of the least squares fit. This was achieved by an \nestimate of R-squared values. The normal probability plot becomes essential as it provides \ninformation about the absence of any serious violation of the normality assumption. For this \nassumption to be true the points in the plot will roughly form a straight line. After necessary \nvalidation of the obtained models, a visual interpretation of the functional relations was made \nby using different projections and graphic illustrations of the response surfaces. \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n3. Results and Discussion \n3.1 Analysis of variance \nThe results of analysis are summarized in table 5. \nInsert table 5 \nThe R2 values for the models, computed as R2 = (Sum of squares attributed to the \nregression)\/(Total sum of squares), were above 0.60, that implied that at least 60% of the \nvariability in the data for each response was explained by the models. In addition, the normal \nprobability plots of the obtained residuals (figure 4) did not reveal anything particularly \ntroublesome.  \nInsert figure 4 \n3.2 Fitted regression models \nThe three input variables selected for this study and their levels were described in table 2. \nExperimental design expressed in uncoded variables and the obtained response values were \nshown in table 3. Those response values were used to compute the model coefficients by \nusing the least square method (table 6). The coefficients and the corresponding P-values \nobtained from the statistical test allowed us to conclude that the main effect of the velocity \nratio (feed rate of mechtrode divided by the traverse rate of substrate) was the most significant \nfactor on the process response. The P-value test is normally performed to determine the \neffects (main or interaction) in the model which are statistically significant. \nInsert table 6 \n3.3 Interpretation of response surface models \nThe relationship between the responses and the experimental variables were illustrated \ngraphically by plotting both the response values versus the experimental factor values \nsimultaneously. Such plots were helpful in studying the effects of the variation of the factors \nin the domain studied and, consequently, in determining the optimal experimental conditions. \nThe topography of the three-dimensional response surfaces were also illustrated by \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nisoresponse contour lines that represent curves of constant response on a two-variable plain. \nResponse surfaces and isoresponse curves for each of the considered response variable were \nprepared by fixing the experimental factors at their intermediate levels. \n \n3.3.1 Bond Strength Evaluation \nTo investigate the effect of rotational speed and velocity ratio on bond strength, the prepared \nsurface and contour plots are shown in figure 5. \nInsert figure 5 \nThe general trend observed was that for a given velocity ratio the increase in rotational speed \nwould decrease the bond strength; however for a given rotational speed the increase in \nvelocity ratio would tend to increase the bond strength. These observations are not in \naccordance with earlier findings by [9] (\u201cincrease in rotational speed would increase the bond \nstrength\u201d). The increase in bond strength with increase in velocity ratio could be attributed to \nthe higher force being applied at the bond interface. \n \n3.3.2 Coating Thickness Evaluation \nReasonably good deposit thickness was achieved for the considered rotational speeds (800, \n1000 & 1500 rpm) even at low velocity ratios (0.2 to 0.3). However, the higher rotational \nspeeds tend to give lower coating thickness for a given velocity ratio. This process behaviour \ncould be explained by considering that the frictional interface area reduces with increase in \nrotational speed, which results in lesser plasticized layer being generated thus reducing \ncoating thickness. \nInsert figure 6 \n3.3.3 Evaluation of Coating Regularity \nFigure 7 illustrates the relationship between the coating regularity and velocity ratio at \ndifferent rotational speeds. The coating regularity had almost similar relationship with \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nrotational speed and velocity ratio, as that was observed for average thickness. The coating \nregularity for lower and intermediate levels of rotational speed appeared to evolve as the \nvelocity ratio was increased. However, the lower level of rotational speed at intermediate to \nhigh level of velocity ratio produced good coating regularity. The same line of reasoning \ncould be followed as given for coating thickness (section 3.3.2) to explain the behaviour of \ncoating regularity with process input parameters. \nInsert figure 7 \n3.3.4 Evaluation of Measured Maximum Temperature \nThe relationship between measured peak temperature (bottom surface of the substrate), \nvelocity ratio and rotational speed is shown below (figure 8);  \nInsert figure 8 \nIt was observed that the measured peak temperatures (at the bottom of the substrate) were \nhigher for extreme limits of the velocity ratio and rotational speed (levels: low-low and high-\nhigh). This effect could be attributed to a thinner deposit layer and hence the reduced distance \nbetween the frictional interface and bond interface. Moreover, it was observed from the plots \n(figures 5, 6, 7 and 8) that the higher temperatures were obtained for those values of rotational \nspeed and velocity ratio, at which the coating quality falls off. \n \n3.3.5 Evaluation of Measured Force \nThe figure 9 illustrates the relationship between force, rotational speed and velocity ratio. \nBased on the statistical analysis and the graphical study it was concluded that the effect of \nrotational speed (within the considered range) on the measured normal force, compared to \nvelocity ratio was insignificant (very slight curvature) and that the velocity ratio was the \nsingle dominant factor contributing towards it. However, the relationship between force and \nvelocity ratio was not completely linear as indicated by the analysis of variance. \nInsert figure 9 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n3.3.6 Optimisation \nThe optimum range of input variables that produced desired results was estimated through the \nuse of overlaid contour plots of the individual process responses (Bond strength, coating \nthickness and coating regularity).  \nInsert figure 10 \nThe desired value for each response was calculated by allowing twenty percent variation in \nthe maximum experimental value obtained for that response. The shaded area shown in figure \n10 indicates the range of input variables that produced the desired process response. The \ndetermined optimal range of input variables required the process to be performed from the \nlower to intermediate levels for rotational speed and at slightly higher value than the \nintermediate level for velocity ratio, to produce the bond strength within the range of 1000 to \n1200, coating thickness of above 1mm and coating regularity between 8 and 10 (table 4). \n \n4. Conclusions \n\u2022 The statistical analysis (ANOVA) indicated that the main effect of the velocity ratio \n(combined effect: calculated by dividing the feed rate of mechtrode with traverse rate \nof substrate) is the most significant factor on the process response.  \n\u2022 For a given traverse and feed rates increase in rotational speed reduced the coating \nquality. However, for a given rotational speed there was a specific ratio between feed \nand traverse rates that had to be maintained for a good bond to exist. Based on the \nresults from optimisation it was observed that the lower to intermediate level of \nrotational speed at slightly higher value than the selected intermediate level for \nvelocity ratio produced good coating quality. \n\u2022 The effect of rotational speed on measured normal force was found to be insignificant \ncompared to the velocity ratio (Vz\/Vx) within the considered experimental range of \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\ninput variables. The peak temperature during the process was obtained for those values \nof input variables that resulted in poor coating quality. \n\u2022 The response surface methodology was found to be effective for the identification and \ndevelopment of significant relationships between process variables. However, future \nempirical investigations could benefit from better representation of design space \nthrough the use of central composite designs, since it was observed that the \nrelationships between process variables were highly non-linear. \nAcknowledgements \nThis research was funded by the GIST-CT-2001-50108 EU grant.
