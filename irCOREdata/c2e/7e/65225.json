Among the others, \nfood industry (supermarket, retailers and wholesales) has witnessed strong cultural and \nbusiness characteristics of family business. Our study focuses on the ethnic Chinese food \nenterprises in the UK. The reason of why we have chosen these two companies: Dayat Foods \nPackaging and Seven Seas (frozen Food) is that they are under the control of one particular \nfamily. Secondly, they represent the key business components of the \u2015food chain\u2016 of Chinese \nindustry: sources of import and packaging. These family-owned enterprises were originally \nestablished by the immigrants from Hong Kong. Through these comparative cases, we would \nlike to explore if the cultural based argument on Chinese business networks can be supported \nthrough their intra-ethnic networks and historical and cultural origins. We are hoping to use \nthese cases to provide an alternative perspective on diasporic Chinese business ties; to provide \nan analysis of the evolution of Chinese-owned firms (i.e. they started out as partnerships, spilt \nwith their co-ethnic partners); and to provide a discussion on generational change on the \nbusiness structure, strategies and management style.  \n \n \nIntroduction  \nAn important debate has erupted between those who write on the cultural dimensions \nof what has come to be termed \u2015Chinese capitalism\u20161 and those who view such \narguments as presenting an essentialist view of identity and a misconception of the \nfactors that influence the development of ethnic-Chinese owned enterprises.\n2\n Among \nthe principal arguments proffered by those within the \u2015Chinese capitalism\u2016 school is \nthat Chinese enterprise is a form of \u2015network capitalism\u2016 or \u2015guanxi capitalism\u2016.3 \nThis form of network capitalism reputedly provides firms owned by Chinese business \npeople with ample competitive advantages.\n4\n   \n There have been nuances in the deployment of the concept of networks. Tang \ndiscovered in her study of guanxi [relations] in Chinese gift-giving culture that \nbusinesses centered on small groups of people would allow for the \u2015cultivation of \n                                                 \n1\n See, for example, Hamilton (2006), Redding (1990), Skinner (1977) and Wong (1985). \n2\n See, for example, Gomez  (1999); Benton and Gomez (2007). \n3\n See, for example, Redding (1990) and Hamilton (1996). \n4\n Yeung and Olds (2000). \n 2 \npersonal relationship\u2016 and \u2015the manufacturing of obligation and indebtedness\u2016.5 Clan \nand trade associations, a prominent institutional feature among the Chinese, are \nreputed to be crucial for the proper functioning of these networks. Liu Hong, for \nexample, addresses the network effect from the social structure of shetuan (voluntary \nassociation) in association with the discourse of the globalization process.\n6\n He \ncontends that \u2017(t)he current trend of shetuan\u2018s globalization should be analyzed in \nconjunction with the growing importance of Overseas Chinese business networks\u2018.7  \n The manner of use of the concept of networks has, however, increasingly been \ncritiqued on the grounds that the cultural predispositions of major Chinese \nentrepreneurs does not influence decision-making to the extent that it accounts for the \nrapid expansion of their enterprises.\n8\n In this \u2015essentialist\u2016 literature, Chinese \nbusinesses are said to display an \u2015ethnic style\u2016, characterized by two important \nfeatures which play a crucial role in capital formation and accumulation: family firms \nand intra-ethnic business networks. The concept of business networks has, however, \nbeen criticized as being one that has not been conceptualized sufficiently and lacking \nin substance as it is not based on empirical fact.\n9\n While the uncritical deployment of \nthe concept of networks has now come to be well critiqued, the family firm, the other \nimportant cultural feature of Chinese enterprise has been insufficiently reviewed. \n Research on Chinese enterprise has indicated convincingly that in family \nbusinesses, kinship ties were crucial in raising funds to get these firms incorporated \nand functioning.\n10\n The original characteristics of the firm, that is when the company \nwas first established, suggest that kinship ties were an important consideration when \npeople were hired, though control remained in the hands of the founder and close \nfamily members. In terms of management style, family members have played a key \nrole in the enterprise.  The use of family firms by businesspeople, and the prevalence \nof these traits in such enterprises, are, however, not unique to the Chinese. \n Over 75 per cent of companies in the industrialized world are family \nbusinesses. Family firms employ about 50-60 per cent of the workforce in \nindustrialized world. Approximately 90 per cent of companies in the United States are \n                                                 \n5\n Tang (1994: 6). \n6\n Liu (1998). \n7\n Liu (1998: 607). \n8\n Gomez (1999); Gomez and Hsiao (2003). \n9\n Ampalavanar-Brown (1998) and Nyaw and Chang (1989). \n10\n See, for example, Wong (1985); Redding (1990); Whitley (1992); Castells (2000) and \nFukuyama (1995). \n 3 \nfamily firms, representing 50 per cent of GNP and 65 per cent of all wages paid. In \n1993, according to Fortune magazine, nearly a third of the top 500 US firms were \nfamily-owned. In Europe, between 75 and 90 per cent of firms are reputed to be \nfamily enterprises. 70 per cent of firms in the United Kingdom are family-owned. One \nin eight companies quoted on the London Stock Exchange are family firms. 43 of \nItaly\u2018s 100 top companies are family-owned.  \n In the literature on family firms, several universal features have been noted. \nThe most important unnoticed feature is that family firms are the outcome of the \nbreak-up of partnerships. In the literature on enterprise development, the stages of \nevolution, briefly, are partnerships (stage one); single owner\/family business (stage \ntwo); and managerial control (stage three). The transition between the first two stages \ncan be quite quick, though the move from the second to third stage would normally \ninvolve a generational change. The conversion of a company functioning as an \nentrepreneurial firm to a managerial enterprise can be seen as a transition from the \nsecond to third stage.\n11\n  \n In family firms, the focus is on perpetuating ownership within the family and \nto build the company for the future generation. This desire is greater than the \nemphasis on making more money. This argument is common in the literature on \nChinese enterprise. Other characteristics common among family firms are presented \nas important traits among Chinese companies. These include, first, the effective use of \nkin as unpaid labor to lower cost of production. Second, owners of family firms tend \nto incorporate new, usually unnecessary, businesses to accommodate all their \nchildren, which can be disastrous for the whole group if a venture fails. The decline of \nChinese-owned firms has been attributed to this reason.\n12\n Third, owners of family \nfirms tend to be reluctant to list their enterprises on the stock exchange, in order to \nretain strong, and unaccountable, control and because of their desire not to divulge \ninformation about their companies; this argument features  prominently in the \nliterature on Chinese enterprise. And, finally, owners of family firms are wary of \nappointing outsiders as members of the board of directors and management, a factor \nthat can hinder the growth of a firm; Chinese family enterprises are  commonly  \nknown to hold a similar view.  \n                                                 \n11\n See, for example, Chandler (1962, 1977). \n12\n See Fukuyama (1995). \n 4 \n One reason why the family ownership mode is widely seen as a cultural trait \nunique to Chinese firms is that the evolution of these enterprises has not been placed \nin historical context. In the case of firms owned by ethnic Chinese of the diaspora, \nspecifically members of the migrant cohort, what remains unstudied is the formation \nand development of these companies.  \n This article assesses the links between the concept of networks and family \nfirms, through a study of the Chinese companies in the food distribution industry in \nBritain. According to Knoke and Kuklinski, a network \u2015is generally defined as a \nspecific type of relation linking a defined set of persons, objects or events\u2016.13 From a \nsectoral point of view, the network can be maintained by clusters, which \u2015are \ngeographical concentrations of interconnected companies and institutions in a \nparticular field\u2016.14 Gereffi\u2018s concept of \u2015commodity chains\u2016 is also useful as it \nprovides insights in how production networks connect a large number of different \nenterprises for their mutual benefit.\n15\n The companies within a \u2015food chain\u2016 network \nwould include those involved a vertically-integrated process of producing, distributing \nand catering, say, Chinese food. These networks, if well integrated, can be designed to \ncut costs, improve the quality of goods, and smooth the way to innovation. \n In the context of a Chinese culture and enterprise, Chen provides a lucid \u2013 and \none could argue, a typical \u2013 description of the role of the family: \n \nFor the Chinese, business has always been connected to \nfamily. In fact, in traditional Chinese culture, the family \nserves as the basis for and prototypical unit of all [italic \nin original] organizations\u2014from social clubs to \neducational institutions to political parties\u2026 From Hong \nKong to Taiwan, Singapore to Bangkok, Jakarta to \nManila, the family is the foundation for all Chinese \nbusiness enterprise.\n16\n \n \n The family, according to such studies, plays a vital role in social network \nformation. This network, usually transnational in structure, is considered to be of \nenormous benefit to the economies of countries where members of this ethnic \ncommunity reside. For instance, in his study of the \u2015social capital\u2016 of ethnic Chinese \n                                                 \n13\n Knoke and Kuklinski (1999: 175). \n14\n Porter (1998: 78). \n15\n Gereffi (1994). \n16\n Chen (2001: 19). \n 5 \nin Thailand, Unger revealed that they \u2017were often embedded within social (Overseas \nChinese) networks extending beyond Thailand\u2018s border\u2018.17 \n This article provides a critique of this pattern of deployment of the concepts of \nnetworks and family firms as a means to de-essentialize the notion of a Chinese form \nof capitalism. The focus of this study is on the thriving Chinese food wholesaling and \nretailing sector in the UK, in order to analyze the nature of the ties between owners of \nthese companies as well as the mode of development of the family firm. Two \ncompanies within this sector have been selected as case studies: Seven Seas (Frozen \nFood) Ltd and Dayat Foods Packaging Ltd, both under the control of one particular \nfamily. These firms constitute members of key components of the Chinese food chain \nindustry, i.e. in the production, distribution and catering of these products.  \n Food distribution firms, among the largest Chinese-owned enterprises in \nBritain, constitute fundamental pillars of the food chain that support the whole \nChinese catering industry. And their form of enterprise can provide insights into the \nimportant role of culture and intra-ethnic business networks among members of this \nethnic community in the Chinese food sector. Most of these firms function as family \nfirms, which allows for an analysis of the extent to which their \u2015Chineseness\u2016 \ninfluences their pattern of enterprise development.  \n Since these companies were incorporated in Britain, their annual reports filed \nat Companies House are an important source of information, providing data on \nownership pattern since incorporation, profiles of directors, sources of funding, links \nwith other firms in and out of the British corporate sector, nature of labor force and \nthe state of financial affairs, including how they coped during periods when they \nregistered losses or how they deployed their profits. Through access to information on \nthese companies\u2018 annual performance, this study attempts to trace historically and \nsystematically the evolution of these family firms. \n  The first section of this article provides a social and economic history of \nChinese enterprise in the UK, as well as the factors that contributed to the \nincorporation of a large number of family firms. It then focuses on the nature of \ncompanies in the Chinese food distribution sector before undertaking an in-depth case \nstudy of two family firms, profiling their rise and their business activities. The study \nconcludes with an assessment as to whether the use of the concepts of networks and \n                                                 \n17\n Unger (1998: 23). See also Cheung (2004). \n 6 \nfamily firms in the literature on Chinese enterprise has served to essentialize Chinese \nenterprise and homogenize this ethnic community.  \n \nHistory of Chinese Food Enterprise in the UK \nThe first Chinese restaurant in London was opened in 1908, but growth of this food-\ncatering industry was slow; by 1931, there were only 17 restaurant keepers in the \ncountry.\n18\n One reason for this slow growth was probably because control of most of \nthe food catering business in London was controlled by the Cheung clan, suggesting \nserious intra-ethnic divides.\n19\n \nIt was during the Second World War that Chinese presence in food catering \ngrew appreciably. As more men were drafted into service during the War, women \nwere required to enter the work force. With demand for ready-made food increasing \nas women were now in full-time employment, canteens had to be set up to prepare \nmeals, which benefited the Chinese. Baxter and Raw point out that \u2017by 1942, 108 \nmillion meals per week were being consumed outside the home, over half of these \nbeing provided through private rather than state catering outlets.\u201820   \nAfter the War, with the return of British soldiers who had served abroad, the \ndemand for foreign cuisine, especially for Indian and Chinese food, grew \nconsiderably. While there were 36 restaurant proprietors in Britain in 1951, by 1967, \none handbook listed the addresses of 1,100 restaurants and takeaways nationwide; by \n1980, this list had 3,500 entries.\n21\n  \nThe burgeoning food catering business, which led to a demand for labor in the \nindustry, contributed to a rise in Chinese migration from Hong Kong to Britain. A \nnumber of other factors encouraged Chinese migration to the UK after the War, \nincluding the Sino-Japanese war, the internal strife that led the Communist Party to \npower, as well as the Cultural Revolution. The takeover of mainland China by the \nCommunist Party in 1949 had led to a large influx of refugees into Hong Kong, then a \nBritish colony. While Hong Kong\u2018s population was 600,000 in 1945, it was well over \n                                                 \n18\n Ng (1968: 9-10). Chinese presence in the launderette industry, on the other hand, grew \nrapidly during the same period. Most of these launderettes were situated in London, though a \nfew were set up in port cities like Liverpool, Cardiff and Bristol. The growth in the number of \nChinese launderettes between 1901 and 1921 suggests that these enterprises had managed to \ncapture a clientele beyond that of the Chinese community (Ng 1968: 9-10). \n19\n Jones (1979). \n20\n Baxter and Raw (1988). \n21\n Baker (1994: 295). \n 7 \ntwo million by 1951, inevitably resulting in severe socio-economic problems in the \ncolony.\n22\n Since the Commonwealth Act facilitated the entry of members of the \nCommonwealth into Britain, this country became another venue for Chinese migrants \nfrom Hong Kong. Compared to the approximately 1,900 ethnic Chinese in the UK in \n1931, this community\u2018s estimated population by the early 1970s was at least 96,000.23 \nThis increase in Britain\u2018s ethnic Chinese population would have probably been \nmuch higher if migration of foreigners had not been checked by the promulgation of \nthe Commonwealth Immigrants Act in 1962. One key aspect of this Act was the \nrequirement that all Commonwealth citizens secure an employment voucher before \ncoming to Britain. To some extent, this restriction was circumvented when the \ndependants of Chinese migrants were brought into the country; this was necessary as \nthere was still an acute need for labor to feed the burgeoning food catering industry. \nIn 1962, the year the Act was introduced, only 135 entry certificates had been issued \nto the dependants of Hong Kong men; by 1967, the number had risen almost ten-fold, \nto 1,211. By 1971, well over 2,000 entry certificates were being issued annually.24 \nInevitably, when the 1971 Immigration Act was introduced, it placed limitations on \nthe entry of dependants. These dependants, usually the wives and children of \nmigrants, were also a crucial source of labor for a number of Chinese had left their \nemployers to establish their own business.  \nThis combination of events, i.e. the bringing over of dependants by people \nwho were setting up their own business, inevitably meant that a growing number of \nChinese migrants had begun to settle permanently in the UK. By 1991, nearly 30 per \ncent of the ethnic Chinese population in Britain was born in the UK. Although the \nintroduction of the Immigration Act probably hindered significantly the number of \ndependants that could be brought into the UK, Baker claims that the Chinese \ncontinued to bring in family members from Hong Kong at a high rate until 1977, after \nwhich it declined appreciably to about less than 1,000 a year.\n25\n \nMost of this population was based in urban areas, largely in London, though \nLiverpool, Manchester and Birmingham also had a relatively sizeable concentration \nof Chinese.  By the 1970s, there were also approximately 3,000 Chinese in Scotland, \n                                                 \n22\n Wong (1988: 3; 16-20).   \n23\n Baker (1994: 298). \n24\n Castles et. al (1984: 44) \n25\n Baker (1994: 298). \n 8 \nroughly 1,400 of whom were in Glasgow and 900 in Edinburgh.\n26\n  By the early 1970s, \nalmost 55 per cent of the ethnic Chinese in the UK were from other parts of Asia, \nincluding Malaysia and Singapore, an indication of that the place of origin of migrants \nof this ethnic community had began to noticeably differ.\n27\n \nIn addition to the demand for labor in the food catering sector, Chinese \nmigration was encouraged as the British economy experienced an economic boom \nbetween 1956 and 1965. There was a five-fold increase in the number of Hong Kong \nresidents in London working in the food catering industry between 1950 and 1960.\n28\n  \nNew Chinese restaurants and takeaways were being opened so rapidly during the \n1950s, that in 1961 the Association of Chinese Restaurateurs (ACR) was formed, \npresumably to ensure high standards among newly-established Chinese restaurants, \nthough probably to serve as an entry barrier to new entrants into the trade.\n29\n  \nMigrants belonging to the same family or close kin brought into the enterprise \nas part of the labor force constituted what has been termed an \u2015ethnic resource\u2016.30 \nKinship ties were effectively utilized to allow ethnic Chinese to secure self-\nemployment and develop their own enterprises. Light and Bonacich used the concept \nof \u2015ethnic resource\u2016 to suggest that owners of firms within \u2015ethnic economies\u201631 \ncould exploit their ethnicity in a variety of ways for the benefit of their enterprise.\n32\n  \nFor example, Light and Bonacich cite the fact that certain skills could be transmitted \nby co-ethnics, cheap labor could be exploited by hiring co-ethnics, especially from \nabroad, and ethnic communities could depend on ethnically-based support networks \nand trade organizations to protect and develop their business base.\n33\n Light and Gold \nnoted that \u2015class resources\u2016 was another factor that had helped entrepreneurs develop \n                                                 \n26\n Ng (1968: 1-2); Watson (1977: 182-83). \n27\n By 2000, there were four main types of Chinese in the UK. First, Hong Kong Chinese from \nthe rural New Territories who had started arriving in large numbers in the 1960s. Many \nmoved into catering and food wholesaling and retailing, the subject of this study. Second, \nSoutheast Asian Chinese, who started arriving in the 1960s, are mostly middle-class and are \nusually professionally trained. The third, and newest, group arrived in the 1980s from Taiwan \nand urban Hong Kong; those in business are mainly in technology and manufacturing. The \nfourth group comprises British-born Chinese. See Benton and Gomez (2007) for a history of \nthe evolution of these different ethnic Chinese groups. \n28\n Ng (1968: 1). \n29\n Ng (1968: 29). \n30\nLight and Bonacich (1988). \n31\n Light and Gold (2000). \n32\n Light and Bonacich (1988). \n33\n Ibid. \n 9 \ntheir firms.\n34\n People with class resources were those who were well-educated or had \naccess to funds, partly also because they were people of financial means. Another \nclass resource of importance was that these businesspeople had acquired working \nexperience in an industry before venturing into business on their own. \n Since the owners of restaurants facilitated the migration of their kinsmen into \nthe UK, the latter remained indebted to their employers for a protracted period. Most \nmigrant workers soon realized that their employers were exploiting them, but since \nmany of them could not speak English, this inhibited them from seeking employment \noutside of the ethnic food sector. Due to this exploitation of their labor, those who \ncould move, or ventured the risk to leave, stayed just long enough to learn the trade, \nstudy the environment and accumulate enough savings to start a small business of \ntheir own. Inevitably, they entered the same food catering business, particularly \nthrough takeaways, as this form of business limited their interaction with the host \ncommunity. Their venture into food catering contributed to growing intra-ethnic \ncompetition. As a consequence of this competition, the Chinese began to spread out, \nleading to the setting up of takeaways and restaurants throughout the British Isles and \nensuring that large ethnic enclaves did not emerge.  \nTheir decision to establish a takeaway, as opposed to a restaurant, as a means \nto start a food catering enterprise, was partly due to government policies, such as the \nSelective Employment Tax (SET) of 1966.\n35\n Jones points out that the SET made \nrestaurants a relatively expensive enterprise to run as it contributed to higher \noverheads.\n36\n The SET contributed to an increase in labor charges as it involved a \nsurcharge on National Insurance contributions made by employers for their personnel. \nIn response to this legislation, takeaways emerged as a logical alternative as the meals \nprepared were acquired for consumption outside the business premises. Labor \nrequirements in takeaways were minimal, as waiters were not required, while family \nmembers could be inducted, without charge, to help out in the running of the business.  \nThe SET proved unsuccessful and was replaced by the Value Added Tax (VAT) in \n1973, which involved a tax on every business transaction undertaken by a firm.  \n                                                 \n34\n Light and Gold (2000). \n35\n The SET was an attempt by the government to raise revenue as well as shift employment \nwithin sectors. Payment of this tax was refundable in all industries except services and \nconstruction, while those involved in manufacturing and scientific research received a \npremium (Jeremy 1998: 120). \n36\n Jones (1979).  \n 10 \n In the early 1970s, the economy had moved into a recession that inevitably \nundermined the restaurant industry. Since there was then an estimated 3,500 to 4,000 \nChinese restaurants and takeaways in the country, a market in recession could not \naccommodate such a large number of catering enterprises.\n37\n  \nHowever, the adverse effects of the economic cycle on the performance of \ncatering enterprises were partly offset by government measures in the Thatcher years, \nparticularly in the early 1980s, when policies were introduced aimed at producing a \nmore entrepreneurial culture. This strategy had a major impact on Britain\u2018s small \nethnic entrepreneurs, who were well represented among the nearly one million people \nwho joined the ranks of the self-employed in the 1980s.\n38\n Incentives were provided to \nestablish such enterprises, leading to a marked rise in the number of ethnic \ncompanies, including \u2013 in the early to mid 1980s \u2013 some leading catering firms.  \nBy the early 1990s, Chinese restaurants and takeaways accounted for one in \nevery four such businesses in Britain. Chinese sources estimated the number of \nrestaurants (some of which double as takeaways) in the mid 1990s at more than 1,500 \nand of takeaways at around 4,000. In 1998, the number of businesses was said to have \nrisen to 7,600, including some 5,000 takeaways. \nSome Chinese, recognizing that the market for takeaways and restaurants was \nbecoming saturated, moved into the wholesale and retail distribution of Chinese food \nproducts. While most retail enterprises served as relatively small grocery outlets, a \nnumber of Chinese supermarkets were established to serve the needs of ethnic food-\nbased enterprises. Those who had moved early into trading in ethnic food seem to \nhave thrived best in business among ethnic Chinese in the food chain. Almost all the \nlargest ethnic Chinese-owned companies in the UK, in terms of turnover and number \nof employees, are involved in the wholesale and retail distribution of ethnic food \nproducts. None of the Chinese-owned companies in the restaurant industry established \nbefore the 1970s have emerged as a major restaurateur. It appeared that these \ndistribution firms had prospered because they served the large Chinese restaurant and \ntakeaway sector in the country. A study of the firms in the distribution sector suggests \nother reasons for their rapid growth. \n \n                                                 \n37\n Watson (1977: 183); Baker (1994). \n38\n Owen (1994: 17). \n 11 \nChinese Family Firms and Ethnic Food Enterprise  \nAmong the largest ethnic Chinese-owned firms, in terms of turnover, are those \ninvolved in wholesale and retail distribution of food products. A majority of them \nwere formed in the 1970s and 1980s (see Table 1).\n39\n These firms include W.Wing Yip \nplc, See Woo Holdings Ltd, Loon Fung Ltd, Hoo Hing Holdings Ltd, Seven Seas \n(Frozen Foods) Ltd, Dayat Foods Packaging Co. Ltd, W.H. Lung Trading Ltd and \nChan\u2018s Ltd. In terms of number of employees and amount of capitalization and \nturnover, all these firms have remained small to medium-sized enterprises.   \n(Table 1 is about here) \nThe main feature of these large Chinese firms is that they are family-owned. A \nmajority of them were established as partnerships, involving non-family members. \nAmong the older companies, particularly the Loon Fung and Dayat Foods Packaging \nGroups, a new generation has emerged who have been incorporated into senior \nmanagement posts or as shareholders. The founders of these Groups however, remain \nin control of these enterprises.  \nThe list of directors and shareholders of the firms in Table 1 provides no \nevidence of interlocking stock ownership or interlocking directorships suggesting \nlittle intra-ethnic cooperation. It is noteworthy that there is no evidence of ties \nbetween owners of these companies as most of them were migrants from Hong Kong.  \nThese firms do not appear to have created mutually beneficial links with \ncompanies along this food chain though situated in the middle of this production line. \nInstead, a number of them have attempted to develop a vertically-integrated \nenterprise, i.e. firms that produce food and those in the catering sector, as a means to \nhelp reduce costs and situate all sectors of the food chain in-house. This attempt at \ncreating a vertically-integrated enterprise, though unsuccessful in all cases, suggests \nan attempt to bypass the need to work with other firms in the food chain.  \nThe largest firms in Table 1, Wing Yip, Loon Fung and Seven Seas (Frozen \nFoods), had shown an ability to recognize changing market trends and had acted \nquickly to create a niche for themselves in the market. Although these companies \ncommenced operations as wholesalers and retailers of Chinese foods, their founders \nhave tried to diversify into other fields of business, a trait common among most \n                                                 \n39\n The oldest firm operating in this sector is Loon Fung (London) Ltd, which was established \nin 1966. It functions now as a holding company and its subsidiary, Loon Fung Ltd, listed in \nTable 1, was incorporated in 1983.  \n 12 \nChinese migrants in business. These firms have established enterprises involved in \nproperty investment, manufacturing and food catering. A review of their development \nsuggests, however, that all these firms have only managed to thrive due to their \nmainstay activity, wholesale distribution of food products.   \nIn spite of the ability of these Chinese to develop their enterprises, there are \nsignificant differences between them. While Woon Wing Yip of Wing Yip was a \npenniless migrant from Hong Kong with little formal education, three brothers \ncollectively played an active role in the development of See Woo Holdings, each \nbringing different skills to the enterprise. M.W. Chan, a migrant from Hong Kong \nwho had received some education in the UK, had originally gone into business with \nhis brother, which emerged as a major wholesaling company in Scotland, before \nmoving on to incorporate Chan\u2018s. Chan and his brother eventually became \ncompetitors in the Chinese food retailing sector in Scotland.  \nA number of the founders of these enterprises had previous experience in food \ncatering or an enterprise related to the distribution of Chinese foods. These class \nresources, along with ethnic resources, such as family labor and funds from kin, \nproved useful in developing their enterprise. A case study of two large Chinese-\nowned companies provides further insights into the crucial factors that contributed to \nthe development of their enterprises. \n \nCase Study1: Seven Seas (Frozen Foods) Ltd \nThis company, incorporated on 8 June 1971 and originally based in Sidcup, Kent, is \ninvolved in the import, export, wholesale and retail distribution of frozen foods. The \noriginal directors of the company were David Guing Chiu Chan, a cook, Stewart San \nYuen So and Eugene Yu Him So. Chan and Eugene were the original shareholders, \neach holding an equal stake of Seven Seas (Frozen Foods)\u2018s paid-up capital of \u00a3100, \nindicating that this enterprise had started off as a partnership. While Stewart was a \nBritish national, Chan and Eugene were listed as \u2015stateless\u2016 at the time of the \ncompany\u2018s incorporation, although both men subsequently became British citizens. In \n1975, Seven Seas (Frozen Foods)\u2018s paid-up capital was increased to \u00a35,000, with the \nshareholding again equally shared between Eugene and Chan.  \n Chan and Eugene were also directors of two other companies, Seven Seas \n(Frozen Foods - Warwick) Ltd and China Frozen Foods (Manchester) Company Ltd, \nboth involved in the wholesaling and retailing of frozen food products. Seven Seas \n 13 \n(Frozen Foods - Warwick) was incorporated on 14 October 1975, with the So brothers \nand Chan as the original directors, each owning 333 shares in the company. China \nFrozen Foods (Manchester) Co was also incorporated in 1975, and its original \ndirectors and shareholders were Chan, Eugene and two Manchester-based frozen food \ndealers, Y.C. Leong and K.Y. Lau. The incorporation of China Frozen Foods \n(Manchester) Co and Seven Seas (Frozen Foods - Warwick) appeared to be an \nattempt by Chan and the So brothers to develop numerous outlets for their frozen \nfoods distribution business. \n The reason for this need to rapidly establish a number of outlets in the UK for \nthe sale of their frozen foods was that the So brothers and Chan had recognized that \nthere was a growing demand for such products, although during the early 1970s \nhousehold spending on food had only increased marginally compared to the previous \ndecade. This point was highlighted by Maunder who noted that although: \n \nthe volume of household spending per head on all foods in Great \nBritain rose little between 1963 and 1972, that on convenience \nfoods jumped by one-fifth  over  the  same period. Frozen foods \nprovided the most dramatic rise in the volume of sales of all \nconvenience foods, more than doubling over this same period. \nBetween 1974 and 1976, only frozen foods maintained their rapid \nsales growth while, in real terms, sales of other convenience foods \nremained static, in common with all other household food spending. \nThe \u2017trading down\u2018 by consumers in response to the squeeze on real \nincomes in 1974 has thus further heightened the problems for \nmanufacturers in expanding sales of processed foods.\n40\n \n \nThe turnover volumes recorded by Seven Seas (Frozen Foods) and Seven Seas \n(Frozen Foods - Warwick) indicates that they had been able to register a considerable \nincrease in sales during the mid-1970s, capturing a segment of the market for frozen \nfoods during this period (see Table 2). This partnership had obviously ventured into \nthe frozen foods market at an opportune time. \n Company records suggest that Chan and the So brothers played an equally \nactive part in developing the Seven Seas (Frozen Foods) Group during the 1970s. In \n1979, however, after almost a decade as an equal shareholder of the company, Chan \ntransferred his interests in Seven Seas (Frozen Foods) to Ho Ping Ho, though the \nlatter was not appointed a member of the board of directors; the directors of the \ncompany then were Eugene and Stewart. Two years later, in 1981, the So family \n                                                 \n40\n Maunder (1980: 80-82). \n 14 \ngained full control of Seven Seas (Frozen Foods) when Ho relinquished his interests \nin the company to Eugene who then held all but one of its 10,000 shares.    \n In 1981, after the So family had secured control of Seven Seas (Frozen \nFoods), the company\u2018s paid-up capital was increased substantially, to \u00a3100,000; this \nentire equity was owned by Eugene. The other directors then of Seven Seas (Frozen \nFoods) were, apart from Eugene and Stewart, David Yun Hung Yuen, a British \nseafood trader who was also a director of Carlson Frozen Foods Ltd; Yuen was \nappointed a director of Seven Seas (Frozen Foods) in July 1982. By 1997, the firm\u2018s \ndirectors were still the same, with Stewart serving as Managing Director.  \n Eugene and Stewart So would later emerge as shareholders and directors of a \nmyriad of companies involved in different activities. Stewart would become a director \nof Seven Seas (Frozen Foods - Warwick), Goodrich Ltd, Seven Seas Trading Ltd, \nSeven Seas (Investments) Ltd, The Emperor Restaurant Ltd and So Restaurants Ltd. \nEugene So would serve as a director China Frozen Foods (Manchester) Co, Goodrich, \nSeven Seas (Frozen Foods - Warwick), Seven Seas (Noodles), Seven Seas Trading, \nand Seven Seas (Investments) Ltd. These firms were involved in the manufacture of \nnoodles, food catering through restaurants and investment holding. Most of these \nfirms would, however, eventually be dissolved.  \n Seven Seas (Noodles), for example, was an Essex-based company \nincorporated on 20 July 1987 to be undertake the processing and wholesale and retail \ndistribution of noodles. Seven Seas (Frozen Food) held a 75 per cent stake in this \ncompany, whose other shareholders included two ethnic Chinese from abroad:  Andy \nLam, a Portuguese national, and Ching Kim Li, a French national; Li would also serve \nas a director of Seven Seas (Frozen Foods). Lam would soon relinquish his interests \nin Seven Seas (Noodles), but would re-emerge as shareholder in 1991, taking over \nSeven Seas\u2018 (Frozen Food) interests in the company. Although funds were poured \ninto Seven Seas (Noodles), particularly for the construction and operation of a factory \nto undertake the processing of food, this enterprise proved a loss-making venture. \nCompany accounts reveal that Seven Seas (Noodles) registered losses from the time it \nbegan operation and in 1993, as losses mounted, it went into liquidation. \n China Frozen Foods (Manchester) Co, one of the first companies established \nby the So brothers was liquidated in 1985. Another trading company established by \nthe So family, Seven Seas Trading, was dissolved in 1995. So Restaurants, \nincorporated in 1982 and based in London, was wholly-owned by Seven Seas (Frozen \n 15 \nFoods), while the original directors were all So family members, i.e. Eugene, Stewart \nand Frankie. So Restaurants proved a profitable concern in the first few years after its \nestablishment, but went into liquidation in 1987. \n The only company established by Seven Seas (Frozen Foods) that has been \ndeveloped profitably is its food wholesaling and retailing subsidiary, Seven Seas \n(Frozen Foods - Warwick). Although the company was jointly owned by the So \nbrothers and David Chan when incorporated in 1975, when its issued capital was \nincreased to \u00a34,000 in 1987, Seven Seas (Frozen Foods) emerged as its sole \nshareholder. By then, the directors of Seven Seas (Frozen Foods - Warwick) were \nEugene and Stewart. After 1992, when Seven Seas (Frozen Foods - Warwick) began \nregistering a remarkable rise in pre-tax profits, the company\u2018s paid-up capital was \nincreased substantially, to \u00a3504,000 (see Table 2). \n(Table 2 is about here) \nSince incorporation, Seven Seas (Frozen Foods - Warwick) has consistently \nregistered a rise in its turnover: from a figure of \u00a3441,903 in 1976, its turnover had \nincreased substantially, to \u00a37.021 million in 1995.  Similarly, the firm\u2018s pre-tax profits \nhave  consistentlyincreased, from a mere \u00a31,532 in 1976 to its peak of \u00a346,112 in \n1992. Seven Seas (Frozen Foods - Warwick) has only 17 employees. \n Seven Seas (Frozen Foods) similarly registered substantial increases in its \nturnover since commencing operations in 1974. That year, the turnover it registered \nwas \u00a3439,449; in 1995, the figure recorded was \u00a311,460 million. Its pre-tax profits \nhave similarly been increasing. In 1974, it had a pre-tax profit of \u00a311,547; in 1995, it \npeaked at \u00a3103,000. The number of people in Seven Seas\u2018 (Frozen Foods) employ has \nnever been very large, peaking at 25 in 1993. \n The Seven Seas (Frozen Foods) Group was incorporated in the form of a \npartnership, but has eventually come under the control of the So family (see Figure 1).  \nThe founding partners of Seven Seas (Frozen Foods) included the So brothers and \nChan, who was also a shareholder of a number of other firms that the So family \nestablished in the 1970s, including China Frozen Foods Manchester Co and Seven \nSeas (Frozen Foods - Warwick). The So brothers collaborated with other ethnic \nChinese when they decided to move into the manufacture of noodles. In the early \nstages of their entry into a business venture, the So family  has sought to establish \nintra-ethnic ties, but these links have not been sustained. \n 16 \n Eugene was originally from Hong Kong, and though he has become a British \nnational,  has maintained close links with other ethnic Chinese from the territory. For \ninstance, two ethnic Chinese who emerged as directors and shareholders of the Seven \nSeas (Frozen Foods) were Frankie Sing So, also a Hong Kong national who became a \nBritish citizen, and Salina So, who still lives in the Territory. David Yuen, who had \nlong been a director of Seven Seas (Frozen Foods), is one member outside the So \nfamily who played a role in the Group over a long period.  More importantly, both \nFrankie So and Yuen were seafood traders by profession, which appears to be a \nreason for their incorporation into the Group. Frankie So, though also a shareholder of \nSeven Seas (Frozen Foods), had no voting rights, and was involved, through \ndirectorships, in companies running a diverse range of activities, including restaurants \nand travel agencies.   \n Eugene, evidently a key figure in the development of the Seven Seas (Frozen \nFoods) Group, has attempted, unsuccessfully, to develop a vertically integrated \nenterprise, by venturing into food manufacturing and catering. The Group also \nincorporated a few frozen foods trading firms around the UK to extend its distribution \nmarket. However, its attempt at diversification has proven costly. The Group\u2018s \nmanufacturing endeavor was unprofitable, in spite of huge investments in this \nenterprise, including the construction of a food production factory. Its venture into \nfood catering has not been sustained, while a few of the firms it established around \nBritain to enhance its marketing of frozen foods have been liquidated (see Figure 1). \n(Figure 1 is about here) \nThe Group has, however, managed to develop its mainstay activity, wholesale \nand retail distribution of food products, through Seven Seas (Frozen Foods) and \nSeven Seas (Frozen Foods - Warwick). The Group\u2018s historical profile indicates a \nconcerted attempt by the So family to develop efficiency to enhance profitability, \nundertaken through reinvestment of profits into the company. For example, in 1994, it \ninvested heavily in the construction of new cold stores. This investment was an \nattempt to help reduce storage costs of stock held by the Group.  The Group\u2018s current \ncorporate structure suggests that in spite of its history of diversification, the focus of \nthis enterprise is now primarily on its wholesaling and retailing activity.  \n The Seven Seas (Frozen Foods)\u2018s market still remains primarily within the \nUK. Although the So brothers have worked with ethnic Chinese based in other parts \nof Europe, the Group has not expanded its market abroad. The So family embarked on \n 17 \nnumerous ventures in partnership with other ethnic Chinese, but the Group is now \nsolely under family control in terms of shareholding.  \n \nCase Study 2: Dayat Foods Packaging Ltd \n \nDayat Foods Packaging Ltd, a holding company based in Middlesex, was \nincorporated on 27 August 1981.\n41\n Originally involved in the wholesale and retail \ndistribution of food and packaging material, it was restructured in 1992, with the firm \nemerging as a holding company and an interest in the property sector and an \ninvolvement in management consultancy. Dayat Foods Packaging\u2018s wholesale and \nretail of food and packaging material business was taken over by its only wholly-\nowned subsidiary, Dayat Foods Ltd, incorporated on 10 December 1982.  Until 1996, \nDayat Foods Packaging had a 15 per cent interest in Wai Lung Engineering Co Ltd, a \nfirm incorporated and based in Hong Kong. After Dayat Foods took over Dayat Foods \nPackaging\u2018s wholesaling and retailing business, the latter\u2018s income would primarily \nbe from rental charges and management services it provided to Dayat Foods. \n The original shareholders and directors of Dayat Foods Packaging were \nFrancis Yuk Hang Poon and Dora Kay Poon, both British citizens; each then held one \nshare of the company\u2018s \u00a32 paid-up capital. When Dayat Foods Packaging\u2018s paid-up \nequity was subsequently increased to \u00a31,000, the shareholders, apart from Francis \n(who owned 500 shares) and Dora (who held 350 shares), included Kenneth Wang, \nTy Wong and Helen Dixon, each of whom owned 50 shares; these three new \nshareholders were based in the United States. There is no indication in the company \nrecords that these US-based shareholders played an active role in the management of \nthe Group; they would, subsequently, relinquish their interests in Dayat Foods \nPackaging. Dora, a housewife, appears to have had a limited management role in the \nGroup, though she remained a shareholder of Dayat Foods Packaging until 1994, \nwhen she resigned as a director of the company. Johnny Poon replaced her as director, \nand Francis emerged as the sole shareholder of all the company\u2018s 1,000 shares. In \n1996, 10 per cent of the firm\u2018s equity was transferred to Johnny. In 1997, the directors \nof Dayat Foods were Francis and Johnny Poon and K. Yueng.  \n                                                 \n41\n Dayat Foods Packaging was formerly known as Freshland Ltd.  The company\u2018s name was \nchanged in November 1981, a few months after its incorporation. \n 18 \n Francis is also a director of Dayat (Manufacturing) Ltd and Dayat Foods Ltd.\n42\n \nApart from its listing of Dayat Foods as a wholly-owned subsidiary, there is no \nindication in Dayat Foods Packaging company records of any affiliation or trade \nbetween it and Dayat (Manufacturing). \n Dayat Foods, which has a paid-up capital of \u00a32, had remained dormant until \n1992 when it took over the wholesaling and retailing activities of Dayat Foods \nPackaging. As Table 3 indicates, Dayat Foods had registered a consistent increase in \nvolume of turnover since 1992, rising from \u00a34.666 million to \u00a37.057 million in 1996.  \nThe firm\u2018s pre-tax profits have not been as impressive, as it recorded losses between \n1993 and 1995, though it registered a large pre-tax profit of \u00a381,299 in 1996. The \nnumber of people in this company\u2018s employ has increased, from 27 in 1992 to 39 in \n1996.  One reason for the rise in turnover between 1992 and 1994 was the opening by \nthe Group of a new cash & carry outlet.  The revenue generated from this new outlet \nhad helped stem losses, improving the Group\u2018s financial position appreciably. The \nDayat Food Packaging Group\u2018s business activities, including the marketing of its \nproducts, continue to be undertaken primarily in the UK.  \n Dayat Foods Packaging\u2018s sources of income include rent received from its \nproperty holdings as well as service charges for management services. The firm\u2018s \nhighest turnover during the 1990s was registered in 1991, when it recorded a figure of \n\u00a3153,750 (see Table 3). Although Dayat Foods Packaging\u2018s turnover has not since \nreached that figure, its turnover did increase appreciably between 1995 and 1997, \nwhen it registered a figure of \u00a3135,000.  Similarly, Dayat Foods Packaging\u2018s highest \npre-tax profit was recorded in 1991, at \u00a388,674; since then, its pre-tax profits have \ncontinued to fall, reaching its nadir in 1994 when it recorded a pre-tax profit of \n\u00a310,040.  Pre-tax profits have, however, subsequently risen, and by 1997 a six-fold \nincrease in profits was recorded, with a figure of \u00a363,777. \n Dayat Foods Packaging\u2018s company records reveal that its primary owners, the \nPoon family, had had co-ownership links with ethnic Chinese in the US, while the \nfirm also had, for a long period, equity interests in the Hong Kong. However, in spite \nof these international links, there is no indication that the Group has extensive cross-\nborder business linkages. The Dayat Foods Packaging Group\u2018s trading activities are \nsolely in the UK. Although the Group had an interest in an engineering company in \n                                                 \n42\n Dayat Foods had been incorporated as Health Food Enterprise (UK). \n 19 \nHong Kong, there is no evidence that Dayat Foods Packaging has diversified its \noperations to include an active involvement in businesses outside that of food \ndistribution. Although company records do indicate that a manufacturing firm, Dayat \nManufacturing, had been incorporated, there is no evidence that the Dayat Foods \nPackaging Group has actively ventured into this sector.  \n(Table 3 is about here) \n \n(Figure 2 is about here) \n \nCulture, Networks and Family Firms  \nThese case studies reflect trends noted among firms operating in the Chinese food \ndistribution sector. Although these Groups are under the control of one particular \nfamily, they were established as  partnerships. These partnerships have, however, not \nbeen sustained. There is no interlocking stock ownership or interlocking directorship \nlinkages involving these Groups and other firms operating in this sector or in the food \nchain network. Even though the owners of these Groups were migrants from Hong \nKong, as are a number of owners of firms operating in the Chinese food chain, there is \nno sign of intra-ethnic cooperative ties for mutual benefit. There is no evidence that \nthe owners of these two Groups belong to, or work with, Chinese associations dealing \nwith Chinese food production, distribution and retailing that would suggest some \nattempt at community building.  \nIn terms of business style, although these Groups are located at the center of \nthe food chain, between production and catering, they do not play a role of \n\u2015middlemen\u201643 serving to consolidate themselves into a mutually beneficial \ncommodity chain. Instead, these Groups have attempted to evolve into vertically-\nintegrated companies, by moving into manufacturing and catering, though they have \nfailed to profitably develop these enterprises. For example, the Seven Seas (Frozen \nFoods) Group attempted unsuccessfully to develop a food manufacturing enterprise \nafter having built up its marketing and distribution base. Dayat Foods Packaging \nGroup did show an interest in developing a manufacturing base, though this desire to \nventure into this sector did not materialize. These Groups have managed to register \ngrowth primarily by focusing on food distribution. \n                                                 \n43\n The concept of \u2015middleman minority\u2016 has long been an important feature in the literature \non Chinese enterprise among migrants. \n 20 \n The owners of these companies have depended on people in Hong Kong and \nthe US as a source of funds when setting up an enterprise. The owners of Dayat Foods \nPackaging, for example, required money from abroad to move into business. The case \nstudies provide no evidence that there are ethnically-based institutions which help \nChinese migrants mobilize capital. Their sources of funding have primarily been local \nBritish banks, though company records indicate some of the firms listed in Table 1 \nhave secured loans from the Bank of China Ltd, incorporated in China, which \nestablished branches in the UK in an attempt to create a niche for itself  in the Chinese \ncommunity. \nKinship ties have evidently proven an important mechanism in obtaining labor \nfor the enterprise. Management, however, remains very closely controlled by the \nfamily. While the founders remain in charge of running these firms, a new generation \nhas emerged in Dayat Foods Packaging Groups, which has been incorporated into \nsenior management posts and as  shareholders. The succession line in the Seven Seas \n(Frozen Foods) Group remains unclear. These companies are still very young \nenterprises, and thus still not subject to the professionalization of the management that \nwell-established family firms tend to introduce. \nThis profile of these Groups provides insights into some of the major features \nof large Chinese firms in the distribution sector. Their ability to identify or capture \nniche markets and their more focused approach to business has facilitated the growth \nof their enterprises, especially after attempts at diversification proved unsuccessful. \nThe owners of these firms \u2013 and their partners \u2013 have class resources, specifically \nexperience in the food sector, which has helped them develop their enterprises. Intra-\nethnic cooperation was crucial for these businesspeople when they first entered into \nbusiness, though the importance of such ties clearly diminished with the growth of the \nenterprise. Intra-ethnic collaborative ties have been difficult to sustain.  \n \nConclusion \nThis study has dealt with three primary concepts  usedin the literature on businesses \nrun by ethnic Chinese, i.e. culture, networks and family firms. An analysis of the \npaths of enterprise development by firms involved the Chinese food chain, from \nproduction to distribution to catering, an important example of an ethnic economy, \nhelped provide insights into the importance of these concepts in the literature on \n\u2015Chinese capitalism\u2016. At first sight, the case studies suggest that there is some merit \n 21 \nto the widely used concept of the network, involving intra-ethnic business linkages. \nThe importance of kinship and co-ethnic ties in the incorporation of a new firm is also \nobvious in this study.    \n However, this historical study of Chinese community and industry and the \ncase studies of the large enterprises in food production indicate a much more complex \nsituation to the pattern of growth of these firms. A number of important factors have \ninfluenced or shaped the evolution of firms operating within this food chain, including \nsocio-economic change in Britain, especially after the Second World War, economic \nand immigration policies, capacity to secure access to funding and the ethnic and class \nresources available to owners of these firms. By focusing on the key actors in these \nfirms, their interactions with co-ethnics and non-co-ethnics and the issues that \ndetermined decision-making, insights have been secured into the dynamics behind the \nevolution of the firm.  \nIf network theorists are right, the ties between ethnic Chinese in the food chain \nwould be spun into business ties, linking those in production, distribution and \ncatering, to promote their economic interests as well as to unify themselves as a single \nethnic community. Intra-ethnic business cooperation has obviously contributed to the \ndevelopment of Chinese capital but not for the reasons suggested in much of the \nliterature. This historical profile of Chinese enterprise reveals that intra-ethnic \ncooperation tends to be important to migrants who are first-time investors. When up \nand running, and as owners of these firms establish a base for themselves in the \ncorporate sector, their reliance on kinship ties as a source for funds, as partners in a \nventure and as a mechanism to secure labor diminishes appreciably. \nThis is reflected in the speed at which partnerships break up, with these \ncompanies coming under the control of one individual or family. The transition from a \npartnership to a family-owned enterprise usually occurs within a number of years after \nthe formation of a company. Interestingly, partners even become competitors within \nthe same sector.  \nAlthough family firms are common among Chinese migrants, they emerge \nprimarily because of the problems migrants face in securing start-up capital and hiring \nlabor. The goal of these family firms is obviously on perpetuating ownership within \nthe family and building the enterprise for future generations. Kinship ties are crucial \nas siblings,  spouses and children can be  sources of unpaid labor, though it is unclear \nif this has been effective in ensuring high quality of work or commitment to an \n 22 \nenterprise. Other studies have indicated that the children of owners of small-scale \nenterprises, especially the takeaways, dread their work in the business.\n44\n  \nThe fact that there is no indication of intra-ethnic or interlocking business ties \namong firms in the food chain gives credence to arguments about major divides that \nexist among ethnic Chinese, including sub-ethnic difference, time of migration to the \nUK and divisions based on class. The class divide is best manifested in the way labor \nfrom Hong Kong, brought in by owners of Chinese enterprises, have been exploited. \nThose employed in this industry soon move on to establish their own enterprise, \nemerging even as competitors to their previous employers.  \nThis sectoral study suggests that these firms compete ferociously with each \nother. They have purposefully distanced themselves from one another because of this \ncompetition, a reason for the community\u2018s wide dispersal. The companies under \nstudy, as well as those listed in Table 1, are based in different parts of Britain, \nincluding London, Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow.\n45\n  \nSince there is a clear attempt to develop these firms as a family business, there \nis little attempt by the owners to cooperate in terms of joint ownership or mergers. \nThis aspiration to go it alone has further contributed to the considerable competition \namong businesspeople running firms in different stages of this food chain, i.e. as \nproducers, distributors or caterers. This intra-ethnic competition is probably the most \nimportant, and hitherto unrecognized, characteristic of the relationship between ethnic \nChinese in a similar line of business. \nThe case studies suggest that individuals in business have no taste for or \nagainst homogeneity when picking partners, preferring to opt for someone who can \ncontribute productively or financially to the enterprise. The focus on Chinese food \ndistribution, an activity within an \u2015ethnic economy\u2016 and primarily made up of \nmigrants, would help explain why co-ethnics figure  prominetly as  the preferable \nchoice  for partnerships. Moreover, this choice of partner or type of labor force can \nchange over time. Other firms in the food distribution sector, as they have grown, \nhave hired non-co-ethnics as a means to broaden their market. \nThis review of the firms in the food distribution sector and the case studies \nreveal a heterogeneity of business styles among the owners of these firms, bringing \n                                                 \n44\n See, for example, Benton and Gomez (2007). \n45\n See also Table 1 for an indication of how firms in the Chinese food distribution sector are \nwidely dispersed throughout Britain.  \n 23 \ninto question a specific form of \u2015Chinese capitalism\u2016. These differences were due to a \nnumber of factors, including resources available, entrepreneurial endowment of \nindividual businessmen, a productive use of experience gained in an industry before \nventuring into business and a focused approach to one trade rather than diversifying \ninto any area of business that appeared potentially profitable. Class resources, \nincluding educational qualifications, access to funds and business experience, have \nbeen useful in explaining why some Chinese have managed to develop their \nenterprises. In some cases, class resources along with entrepreneurial traits, such as \nthe ability to correctly predict market trends and take risks by investing in a \npotentially lucrative opportunity, have proved crucial.  \nChinese-owned enterprises have no special ethnic style, contrary to much \ncurrent scholarship on the supposedly unique character of \u2015overseas\u2016 Chinese \nbusiness, which also brings into question the application of the concept of \u2015Chinese \ncapitalism\u2016.  The overwhelming attention on the ostensible business networks among \nChinese-owned enterprises and on the impact of cultural traits on their form of \nenterprise development, including the use of family firms to run a business, has \ndiverted attention from important concepts useful for explaining form of capital \ndevelopment by members of this community. This study indicates that the concepts \nmore useful for understanding Chinese enterprise are entrepreneurship,\n46\n class \nresources\n47\n and firm development and organization.\n48\n \n                                                 \n46\n Schumpeter (1943); Barth (1967). \n47\n Light and Bonacich (1988). \n48\n Chandler (1962, 1977); Penrose (1980); Williamson (1975); Porter (1985, 1990). \n 24 \nTable 1 \nLargest Chinese-Owned Wholesalers and Retailers in the UK \nCompany                       Activity        Location      Paid-up   Turnover   Pre-Tax    No. of      Shareholders       Directors \n(Incorporation Date)                                              Capital                       Profit     Employees  \nW.Wing Yip                     Chinese su-         Birmingham       1,000,000    31,062,000     664,000       77          W.W Yip & Bro-         W.W.
