Introduction\n[2] The ionospheric absorption of cosmic radio noise,\nmeasured by a riometer, is a function of electron-neutral\nmomentum-transfer collision frequency and electron density,\nintegrated over the path length [Davies, 1966]. The aim of this\nwork is to apply linear regularization to a large (several\nthousand) number of absorption measurements with corre-\nsponding profiles of electron density in order to infer a collision\nfrequency profile of the ionospheric D-region, which is re-\nsponsible for the majority of absorption at high frequencies.\n[3] Additionally, the method herein can reveal whether\nthe electron density data at any given altitude and time are\ncontributing more or less than expected to the ground-\nmeasured absorption.\n[4] Previously, Miyazaki [1975] obtained a collision fre-\nquency profile by combining eight rocket-measured elec-\ntron density profiles of the Antarctic D-region, with\ncorresponding ground-based cosmic noise absorption mea-\nsurements. By assuming a log linear altitude dependence,\nthe least squares method was employed to give a collision\nfrequency profile of the form n = n0 exp(\u0001h\/H), where h is\nthe height above ground level and H is the scale height.\n[5] Serafimova and Serafimov [1991] proposed a method\nutilizing two ground-absorption measurements, together\nwith ionosonde measurements, to arrive at an approximate\nexponential collision frequency profile of the ionosphere.\nGokov et al. [1991] described a technique to simultaneously\nestimate electron density and electron-neutral collision\nfrequency profiles, based on measurements of differential\nabsorption and phase differences of the O and X components\nof partial reflection (PR) signals. This was used at Khar\u2019kov\nState University to measure electron density and collision\nfrequency profiles to an accuracy of better than 30%.\n[6] Similarly, Vuthaluru et al. [2002] calculated collision\nfrequency profiles in the low latitude D-region by partial\nreflection differential absorption and differential phase,\nusing the large MF radar at Buckland, Australia. Though\nrelying on atmospheric models for the extrapolation of\nresults from lower altitudes, a good agreement with\nCIRA-86 calculated collision frequencies was reported\nbelow 80 km.\n[7] Such investigations are critical in assessing and\nimproving models of the upper atmosphere, in which\nsystematic errors can be a significant problem, often caused\nby the interpolation and extrapolation of empirical data that\ndoes not cover a wide enough range of locations, times, or\nconditions. Drob and Picone [2000] report that two previous\nmodels, MSISe-90 [Hedin, 1991] and CIRA-86 [Flemming\net al., 1988], are both thought to underestimate and over-\nestimate the mesopause region temperatures by around 15 K,\nat midlatitudes and high-latitudes respectively. They explore\nthe shortcomings of such atmospheric models in an area\nwhere their performance would be of great importance, that\nof the potential infrasonic monitoring of a Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). As a function of neutral\ndensity and temperature, the electron-neutral effective\nmomentum-transfer collision frequency can, to some extent,\nact as a proxy for these parameters in a test of the accuracy\nof an atmospheric model.\n[8] The primary result of this study is in the form of time-\naveraged correction factors for the effective collision\nfrequency profile calculated with the NRLMSISe-00 neutral\natmosphere model, for active (ap > 50) and quiet (ap < 50)\nconditions over the period 2004\u201311\u201309 to 2004\u201311\u201313.\nThe method would be equally effective if results were to be\nsplit between, for example, heater on and heater off periods\nof a colocated ionospheric heating facility.\n2. Instruments\n[9] The European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) VHF\nradar [Baron, 1986] measures the basic parameters of the\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, A05303, doi:10.1029\/2007JA012650, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Communication Systems, University of Lancaster,\nUnited Kingdom.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2007JA012650$09.00\nA05303 1 of 9\nionosphere from an altitude of 60 km to 1600 km. It is\nlocated near Troms\u00f8 (69\u0001350N, 19\u0001140E). Between 2004\u2013\n11\u201309 and 2004\u201311\u201313, the VHF radar was operating\nunder the arc_dlayer-v program, which provided electron\ndensity measurements for the altitude range 60\u2013140 km.\n[10] The Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies\n(IRIS) [Browne et al., 1995], comprises a 7 \u0003 7 array of\n49 riometer beams, acheiving a maximum angular resolu-\ntion of 13\u0001 at zenith. It measures the ionospheric absorption\nof X-mode cosmic noise above Kilpisjarvi (69\u0001030N,\n20\u0001470E) at 38.2 MHz, sampling all beams once per second.\nIRIS is located approximately 83 km from the EISCAT\nVHF radar with beam 9 passing directly over EISCAT, see\nFigure 1. Also shown is the projection of beam 558 of\nARIES [Grill et al., 2003]. ARIES is a new type of riometer\nwith a much higher angular resolution than IRIS (max.\n4.75\u0001 at zenith). It receives at 38.2 MHz, and is located just\n12.7 km from EISCAT.\n3. Theory\n[11] The Appleton-Hartree equation for the absorption\ncoefficient, k, of monoenergetic electrons (i.e., electrons\nsharing the same collision frequency) is:\nk \u00bc e\n2\n2mec\u00010\n:\n1\nm\n:\nNenm\nn2m \u00fe w\u0006 wH cos q\u00f0 \u00de2\nNp=m; \u00f01\u00de\n[Davies, 1966] where nm is the energy-dependent electron-\nneutral momentum-transfer collision frequency, m is the real\npart of the refractive index, w is the incident angular wave\nfrequency, wH is the electron gyrofrequency, q is the angle\nbetween the external magnetic field and the direction of\nphase-propagation of the incident wave, and Ne is the\nelectron density. The \u00b1 applies to absorption of the O-mode\nand X-mode respectively.\n[12] This is identical to the approximation by Sen and\nWyller [1960] when their primary assumption is applied,\nnamely that the collision frequency is proportional to the\nelectron energy (nm \/ v2) and the function k is integrated\nover the electron energy distribution using the Chapman-\nEnskog method [Chapman and Cowling, 1970; Itikawa,\n1971]. The Appleton-Hartree method has the advantage that\na collision frequency function with any chosen dependence\non electron velocity may be used.\n[13] In the D and lower E regions absorption is largely\nnon-deviative, so m \n 1 may be assumed. Also, for the\nreceiving frequency of IRIS, nm\n2 above \u000b60 km is small\ncompared to w2, allowing integration over the electron\ndistribution to be performed to the collision frequency\nalone \u2013 rather than the entire function \u2013 resulting in an\neffective collision frequency:\nneff \u00bc\nX\nneutral species\nhne;neutral speciesi: \u00f02\u00de\nFigure 1.

IN THE D-REGION\n2 of 9\nA05303\nThe angled brackets denote an average over the electron\nenergy distribution, which is assumed to be Maxwellian.\nConverting from Nepers to decibels and integrating over the\npath length, (1) becomes:\nAbsorption \u00bc 4:6\u0003 10\u00015\nZ\nNeneff\nn2eff \u00fe w\u0006 wH cos q\u00f0 \u00de2\ndl dB: \u00f03\u00de\n[14] Kinetic calculations for the general refractive index\n[Garrett, 1985] are employed to investigate the validity of\nthe simplifications made in reaching (3).\n[15] The maximum electron density encountered within\nthis study is around 9 \u0003 1011 m\u00013, resulting in m falling to\n0.975 and the differential absorption given by the integrand\nof (3) being around 2.5% too low. However, plotting time\nseries of the radar data reveals that spikes of the same\nmagnitude are common. These often result in nonsensical\nnegative data, and are difficult to remove without skewing\nintegrated values, for example, by excluding all negative\nvalued data. In view of the considerable random errors in\nthe radar data, we require the relationship between electron\ndensity and absorption to be linear and therefore choose to\nkeep the approximation m \n 1.\n[16] The error introduced by using an effective collision\nfrequency is greatest at low altitudes and falls very quickly\nwith increasing height. With a receiver frequency of\n38.2 MHz for IRIS, the absorption is typically calculated\nto be less than 2% too large at 60 km, and 0.1% too large at\n70 km. However, at 10 MHz these values increase to 26%\nand 2%, respectively, and at 5 MHz they are 210% and\n10%.\n[17] It is convenient to take the simple formulas calculated\nby Schunk and Nagy [1978] for the effective collision\nfrequencies of the most populous atmospheric species. These\nare based on the cross sections given by Banks [1966], with\nthe exception of atomic oxygen.\n[18] The momentum-transfer cross section of atomic\noxygen is difficult to determine experimentally; Schunk\nand Nagy [1978] took results from Henry and McElroy\n[1968], but we choose slightly more recent values by\nThomas and Nesbet [1975]. The latter are a little higher\nover the temperature range of interest and closer to the\nvalues of Banks [1966]. The relative concentration of\natomic oxygen increases with altitude; at 110 km it is\naround 12% of the total neutral density. Here the higher\ncross section values provided by Thomas and Nesbet\n[1975], and used in this study, translate to a rise of just\n3% in the differential absorption.\n[19] For molecular nitrogen we use momentum-transfer\ncross sections from Morrison et al. [1997]. Although these\ndiffer considerably from Banks [1966], especially at low\nenergies, the variations largely cancel when integrated over\nthe electron energy distribution and amount to less than\n2.5% in the temperature range 150\u2013500 K. The updated\neffective momentum-transfer collision frequencies for use\nbetween 150 K and 500 K, and employed in this study are:\nhne;N2i \u00bc N N2\u00f0 \u00de 4:02\u00fe 2:37 1\u0001 1:54\u0003 10\u00014Te\n\u0003 \u0004\nTe\n\u0003 \u0004\u0003 10\u000117;\n\u00f04\u00de\nhne;Oi \u00bc 1:37\u0003 10\u000116N O\u00f0 \u00de 1\u00fe 3:32\u0003 10\u00014Te\n\u0003 \u0004\nT\n1\n2\ne; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere N(N2) and N(O) are the densities of N2 and O\nrespectively, in m\u00013. Te is the electron temperature in\nKelvin.\n[20] Cross sections for the other neutral species are taken\ndirectly from Banks [1966], noting that those for the other\nimportant species, O2, agree with more recent measure-\nments by Sullivan et al. [1995], within the errors of their\nwork.\n4. Method\n[21] A linear problem in inverse theory generally takes\nthe form:\nci \u00bc\nZ\nri x\u00f0 \u00deu0 x\u00f0 \u00de dx\u00fe ni; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere each ci is a measurement that contains information\nabout a particular aspect of an unknown process, u0(x), and\nni is the error of the ith measurement. The measurements are\nrelated to the unknown process by the response kernel, ri(x).\nGiven the measurements, their errors, and the response\nkernel, a statistical approximation, u^0(x), to the unknown\nprocess, u0(x), is sought. In our case ci is the height\nintegrated absorption measured by IRIS and ri(x) are\nmodeled absorption profiles, (given by (3)). These modeled\nprofiles are calculated with electron densities measured by\nthe EISCAT VHF radar together with the model neutral\natmosphere, NRLMSISe-00. u0(x) is therefore a scaling\nfactor for the modeled absorption, which, after a small\niterative correction, gives a scaling factor for the modeled\neffective momentum-transfer collision frequency at each\naltitude. For this reason we denote the absorption scaling\nfactor as u0(x), and the collision frequency scaling factor as\nu(x). The radar range gates are discrete and the integral in\n(6) is accordingly replaced by a sum.\n[22] By choosing our solution to be a scaling factor for\nmodel values the regularization is greatly simplified and, by\nre-running the neutral atmosphere model for each profile,\ndiurnal variations of the neutral atmosphere are included a\npriori.\n[23] The Backus-Gilbert method of regularization is uti-\nlized and briefly described below. For a more in-depth\nexplanation see Press et al. [1996].\n[24] We seek a solution to the inversion problem\nexpressed in (6), that is a compromise between an exact\nsolution to the data set and one that is reasonable. This is\nachieved by minimizing the expression:\nA\u00fe lB; \u00f07\u00de\nwhere A is a measure of the spread (the reciprocal of\nresolution) of the solution, i.e., how far the solution is away\nfrom an exact solution for the data set. B is a measure of its\ninstability, i.e., how unrealistic the solution is. l allows\ntuning of the result between a stable solution and one that\nbest fits the specific data set.\n[25] The resolution function, d^ (x, x0), is implicitly defined\nby:\nu^0 x\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nZ\nd^ x; x0\u00f0 \u00deu0 x0\u00f0 \u00de dx0; \u00f08\u00de\nA05303 BEHARRELL AND HONARY: EFFECTIVE COLLISION FREQ. IN THE D-REGION\n3 of 9\nA05303\nwhere u^0(x) is our smooth, statistical solution and u0(x\n0) is\nthe exact (though highly unstable) solution for the particular\ndata set used. x represents the altitude for which we are\nfinding the solution, and x0 the altitudes of the radar range\ngates. Minimizing A, to increase the resolution of the\nsolution, is equivalent to bringing the resolution function\ncloser to the identity matrix.\n[26] Figure 2 shows the resolution function corresponding\nto our result, for several values of x. The value of l is\nreduced with altitude in order to keep a reasonable resolu-\ntion across the entire range of x.\n[27] An error value, ni, is assigned to each absorption\nmeasurement, ci. These control the weight given to each\nsample, as well as defining the error bounds of the final\nresult through the standard propagation of errors. The\nBackus-Gilbert method provides a solution for u^0(x),\ntogether with the corresponding errors.\n[28] It is useful to define the set of inverse response\nkernels, qi:\nu^0 x\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nX\ni\nqi x\u00f0 \u00de \u000e ci; \u00f09\u00de\nand the integrated response kernel, Ri:\nRi \u00bc\nZ\nri x\u00f0 \u00de dx: \u00f010\u00de\nB, the measure of the stability of the solution, is given by:\nB \u000f var u^0 x\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \u0011 \u00bc q x\u00f0 \u00deT S q x\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f011\u00de\nwhere Sij is the covariance matrix. The errors, ni, are herein\nassumed to be independent, therefore:\nSij \u00bc n\n2\ni ; if i \u00bc j;\n0 if i 6\u00bc j:\n\u0005\n\u00f012\u00de\nA, the measure of the width or spread of d^ (x, x0), is given\nby:\nA \u00bc q x\u00f0 \u00deT W x\u00f0 \u00deq x\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f013\u00de\nwhere Wij(x) is the spread matrix:\nWij x\u00f0 \u00de \u000f\nZ\nx0 \u0001 x\u00f0 \u00de2ri x0\u00f0 \u00derj x0\u00f0 \u00de dx0: \u00f014\u00de\nThis definition, used by Backus and Gilbert in their method,\nis one of many possible definitions.\n[29] Equation (7) can now be written in terms of Sij and\nWij(x) as:\nA\u00fe lB \u00bc q x\u00f0 \u00deT W x\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe lS\u00bd \u0011 q x\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f015\u00de\n[30] The solution to the set of inverse response kernels is:\nq x\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc W x\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe lS\u00bd \u0011\n\u00011\nR\nRT W x\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe lS\u00bd \u0011\u00011 R \u00f016\u00de\nwhere R is the integrated response kernel.\n[31] The result of multiplying the inverse response ker-\nnels, qi(x), by the measurements, ci, can be used to indicate\nwhether a particular part of the data set is responsible for\ncontributing a greater or lesser amount than expected\ntoward the measurement values. This is particularly useful\nin determining whether a specific feature in the data set, in\nour case the electron density data, is real, or an instrumental\neffect.\n[32] Finally, combining (9) and (11), we have:\nu^0 x\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc cT q x\u00f0 \u00de \u0006\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nq x\u00f0 \u00deT S q x\u00f0 \u00de\nq\n: \u00f017\u00de\n[33] This solution is computationally demanding, requir-\ning the inversion of an N \u0003 N matrix for each altitude value,\nx, where N is the number of measurements, ci.\n[34] Once the differential absorption scaling factor, u^0(x),\nhas been calculated, the collision frequency scaling factor\ncan be found with an iterative formula based on the\nintegrand of (3).\nu^n\u00fe1 x\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc u^0 x\u00f0 \u00de\nu^n x\u00f0 \u00de2\u00fe w\u0006wH cos q\u00f0 \u00de\n2\nnmm x\u00f0 \u00de2\n1\u00fe w\u0006wH cos q\u00f0 \u00de2\nnmm x\u00f0 \u00de2\n0\nB@\n1\nCA; \u00f018\u00de\nu^ x\u00f0 \u00de \u000f u^n!1 x\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc num x\u00f0 \u00denmm x\u00f0 \u00de ; \u00f019\u00de\nwhere nmm is the modeled effective momentum transfer\ncollision frequency, num is the unknown effective momen-\nFigure 2. d^, the resolution function.\nA05303 BEHARRELL AND HONARY: EFFECTIVE COLLISION FREQ. IN THE D-REGION\n4 of 9\nA05303\ntum transfer collision frequency, and w is the angular wave\nfrequency. This step is necessary when studying absorption\nfrom a lower altitude or using a riometer with a lower\nreceiving frequency, since w2 \u0015 nm2 may no longer hold. In\nsuch cases one would also have to take care when\ncalculating the modeled absorption, as discussed in section 3.\n[35] Notes within the Fortran code of the NRLMSISe-00\nneutral atmosphere model [Picone et al., 2002], state that\n\u2018\u2018F10.7, F10.7a (an 81-day running mean of F10.7), and ap\neffects are neither large nor well established below 80 km\nand these parameters should be set to 150, 150, and 4\nrespectively.\u2019\u2019 For the NRLMSISe-00 model input we use\nthese suggested values at all altitudes (\n60\u2013110 km) and\nthroughout the event. This simplifies interpretation of the\nresults when splitting the data between periods of active and\nquiet conditions, and avoids a discontinuity at 80 km.\n5. Data\n[36] Between 09 November 2004 to 13 November 2004 a\nunique set of data was recorded by EISCAT and IRIS. Over\nthe 5 day period geomagnetic conditions changed from very\nactive to quiet, there was little in the way of solar radio\nemissions to contaminate IRIS measurements, and polar cap\nabsorption (PCA) [Reid, 1974] provided \u2018\u2018illumination\u2019\u2019 of\nthe lower D-region.\n[37] Figure 3 shows that active conditions (ap > 50)\nlasted until 10 November 2004 21:00 UT and were followed\nby a quiet period, during which the value of ap remained\nbelow 50 for the rest of the data set.\n[38] In Figure 4 the height-integrated absorption mea-\nsured by beam 9 of IRIS is shown, together with a color plot\nof the modeled absorption based on radar data, which makes\nup the response kernel. The EISCAT VHF radar\u2019s power\nprofile data with 1 min integration and 300 m range gates is\nused. As expected, a clear correlation can be seen between\npatches of strong modeled absorption and high levels of\nmeasured absorption. Exceptions can be seen around mid-\nday, especially on 11 November 2004.\n5.1. Excluded Data\n[39] Figure 5 shows four subsets of data, each containing\nperiods of poor correlation between the absorption modeled\nusing EISCAT data and that measured by IRIS. These are\nexcluded from the calculation.\n[40] In Figure 5a the correlation is excellent until around\n10 November 2004 05:15 UT, when the larger beam of IRIS\nhas a smoothing effect on the now spatially non-uniform (as\nconfirmed by IRIS images) ionosphere. Both peaks and\ntroughs become less pronounced in the IRIS measurements.\n[41] Polar mesospheric winter echoes (PMWE) [Ecklund\nand Balsley, 1981] contaminate the radar data and, subse-\nquently, the modeled absorption in Figure 5b. This occurs\naround midday on most of the days in the data set, and is\nusually accompanied by a significant contribution to\nabsorption in IRIS from PCA at altitudes below the range\nof the radar, rendering data from these periods useless.\nHargreaves [2005] reports that altitudes between 45 and\n65 km typically account for 80% of the total daytime\nabsorption during PCA events. For 2\u20133 h toward the\nbeginning and end of these periods, Figure 4 shows that the\nabsorption tapers off within the altitude range of the radar.\n[42] Beginning 12 November 2004 14:40 UT and lasting\na few hours, a small localized patch of absorption overlaps\nwith the eastern extent of beam 9, and is seen more strongly\nin the neighboring beam to the east. It appears stationary\nwithin the IRIS images and is not seen in the radar (Figure 5c).\nThe modeled absorption matches well with the neighboring\nIRIS beam to the west. Toward the end of this period large,\nshifting patches of absorption are seen advancing northward\nin the IRIS images. They enter IRIS beam 9 around a\nminute earlier than the radar (Figure 5d).\n[43] With the exception of Figure 5b these problems\nshould be eliminated by using a riometer and radar with\ncomparable fields of view.\n[44] Additionally the period 10 November 2004 18:10 UT\nto 11 November 2004 01:00 UT is also excluded. This\ncovers three strong patches of enhanced electron density\nthat seem to have little to no effect on the absorption\nmeasured by IRIS. When included, this period affects the\nresult significantly; it is thought that the patches are very\nlocalized (i.e., smaller than the riometer beam).\n5.2. Sources of Error\n[45] As well as the expected instrument errors encoun-\ntered in the measurements, prominent sources of error\ninclude: calibration of the radar data, errors in the riometer\nquiet day curve and the different fields of view of the\nriometer and radar beams (see Figure 1).\n[46] The field of view of the 9th beam of IRIS is closest\nto that of the vertically pointing radar, intersecting it at\n\n80 km (Figure 1). Although it is possible to interpolate\nbetween the riometer beams for the location of the radar\nbeam at each altitude, the correlation between the instru-\nments is hampered by the contribution to the other riometer\nbeams from absorption further away from EISCAT. Fortu-\nnately, the absorption profiles are centered at approximately\n80 km, making the pointing direction of beam 9 ideal.\nFigure 3. 3-h values of ap index (solid line) with daily\nF10.7 index (dashed line).\nA05303 BEHARRELL AND HONARY: EFFECTIVE COLLISION FREQ.

IN THE D-REGION\n6 of 9\nA05303\n[47] There are difficulties in calibrating the EISCAT VHF\ndata directly with the dynasonde. Instead it is calibrated\nagainst electron density measurements from the EISCAT\nUHF radar, which is itself calibrated against the dynasonde.\nComparing many samples of the UHF and VHF data from\nan overlapping altitude range on 13 November 2004, the\nmedian electron density ratio is found to be 1.84, the mean\n1.90 and the total error in the mean 0.144 (\n8%). The\nmedian value being the better choice as the values are not\nsymmetrically distributed about the mean.\n[48] There are no error values given with the EISCAT\npower-profile data but an estimate of the random error can\nbe taken from the data by comparing consecutive samples.\nThe estimated error of the integrated modeled absorption,\nRi, carried through from the radar data is:\nsRi \n\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiX\nn\nri;n \u0001 ri;n\u00fe1\n\u0003 \u00042\n2\nvuut \n 0:025 dB: \u00f020\u00de\n[49] Let us define mi as the measured absorption, ci,\nminus the modeled absorption, Ri:\nmi \u00bc ci \u0001 Ri: \u00f021\u00de\nsRi is close to the noise-limit of IRIS and is small compared\nto the width of the distribution of mi for this data set, which\nis symmetrical but has a longer-than-Gaussian tail. This\nlarger variability between the modeled (radar) and measured\n(riometer) values is almost certainly due to the separation of\nthe instruments. Although it is impossible to know how the\ncolocation error is distributed in altitude, assuming that it is\nconstant allows for the use of combined error values, ni. It is\nlogical to assume, and can be clearly seen in the data, that\nthis colocation error increases with increasing absorption.\n[50] Plotting the standard deviation of mi for several\nsubsets of data, binned according to ci, gives an idea of\nthe relationship between absorption, ci, and combined\n(colocation and instrument) error. A good approximation,\nwhich forms the basis of our error values, is found to be:\nni \u00bc \u0006\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n0:5 dB\u00bd \u00112\u00fe 0:5\u0003 ci\u00bd \u00112\n\u0011 \u0012r\n: \u00f022\u00de\n[51] Several hours of scintillation occurred each night\nbetween approximately 22:00 UT and 03:30 UT (red lines,\nFigure 4). The error estimate for these periods is increased\naccordingly.\n[52] It should be noted that multiplying every value of ni\nby a constant has no effect on the final result, but the errors\nof the result scale proportionally with the constant.\n6. Results\n[53] Figure 6 shows that the effective momentum-transfer\ncollision frequency profiles calculated using the NRLMSISe-\n00 model are very accurate in the 68\u201395 km range, with\ncorrection factors that are close to unity during both the\nactive and quiet periods. Above 95 km the larger error\nindicates that the stability of the result is poor, this is due to\nthe small contribution to the total absorption and a unifor-\nmity of absorption with respect to height at these altitudes.\nThe apparent rise in the correction factor above 95 km, in\nboth the active and quiet periods, is therefore thought to be a\ncoincidence rather than a real trend. Generally, an absorp-\ntion profile with an unvarying shape will present a badly\nposed inversion problem, supplying little information of the\nreal-life contribution to integrated absorption (and thus\ncollision frequency) from each altitude.\n[54] Below 68 km the result is smaller than unity, and less\ncertain than might be expected. Clutter in the arc_dlayer-v\nprogram on the EISCAT VHF system was significantly\nreduced in June 2004 but may still remain a factor,\n(I. Ha\u00a8ggstro\u00a8m, private communication, 2007). This could\nbe responsible for systematic overestimating in the power\nprofile data from the lower range gates, leading to a reduced\ncorrection factor. The added uncertainty is caused by larger\nerrors inherent in measuring very small electron densities,\ntogether with the rarity of patches of significant absorption\nat low altitudes.\n[55] The result for the entire data set, Figure 6a, is closer\nto that of the quiet period, Figure 6c, simply because the\nFigure 5. Subsets of data that show periods of poor\ncorrelation between absorption calculated using EISCAT\nand NRLMSIS (solid line) and measured by beam 9 of IRIS\n(dashed line). (a), (b) are 11 November 2004; (c), (d) are\n12 November 2004. For further explanation see text.\nA05303 BEHARRELL AND HONARY: EFFECTIVE COLLISION FREQ. IN THE D-REGION\n7 of 9\nA05303\nmajority of the data falls within the quiet period. The mean\nvalues of each correction factor profile between 70 km and\n93 km, where the result is reasonably stable, are 0.965,\n0.956 and 0.974, for all of the data, the active period and the\nquiet period respectively. Each of these factors differ from\nunity within the error of the calibration of the radar data\n(\n8%). Therefore the effect of the ap index on the effective\ncollision frequency in the D-region is minimal, and less than\nthe errors of our result. This confirms the assumption that\n\u2018\u2018ap effects are neither large nor well established below\n80 km\u2019\u2019, suggested in the NRLMSISe00 source code.\n[56] Without any regularization the inversion would be\nvery badly posed, and the resultant profiles would oscillate\nwildly. In making the result smooth, the regularization has\nan effect similar to that of a low-pass filter. Some residual\noscillation is present in each of the profiles, but it is\nimportant that we do not lose real features by overly\nconstraining the result.\n[57] Multiplying the effective collision frequency pro-\nfiles, calculated with values from the neutral atmosphere\nmodel NRLMSISe-00, by the correction profiles (Figure 6),\ngives corrected effective collision frequency profiles. The\ncorrected profiles for 10 November 2004 00:00 UT (active\nconditions) and 12 November 2004 00:00 UT (quiet con-\nditions), are shown in Figure 7.\n[58] In order to check that our regularization is not\nconfining the result (beyond a reasonable amount) to the a\npriori information, we run the program with various changes\nto the response kernel, r. Each profile of r (the model\nabsorption per radar range gate) is multiplied by the\nfunctions depicted on the left hand side of Figure 8 and\nthe resulting variation in the solution, u^0, is shown in the\nright hand side. For example, the top plot shows the effect\nof increasing the NRLMSISe-00 calculated absorption by\n20% at all altitudes. Ideally, the solution would then be\ncompensated by a reduction of 100 \u0003 (1 \u0001 1\/1.2) = 16.67%\nat all altitudes.\n[59] The changes in our result match very well with the\nideal response for slowly varying functions of altitude such\nas the first two examples, but narrow layers are less\nresolved. This is a reflection of the sensitivity of the result\nto similar variations in the actual neutral atmosphere.\n[60] Inspection of the set of inverse response kernels\nreveals that, when included in the data set, PMWE contri-\nbutes far less to the measured absorption than would be\nexpected from such an increase in electron density. The\nsame is true for the apparent enhancement in the EISCAT\ndata (Figure 4) at an altitude of 100\u2013105 km on 09November\n2004 17:00 UT. Neither are thought to be real enhancements\nof electron density.\n7. Conclusion\n[61] We have demonstrated a new technique for measur-\ning the effective electron-neutral momentum-transfer colli-\nFigure 7.

The results match\nwell with values derived from the NRLMSISe-00 neutral\natmosphere model and show no detectable variation\nbetween the active and quiet periods. The method would\nbe improved by using a riometer located at the radar site,\nwith a comparable field of view. This would allow for\nhigher altitude resolution, while reducing the errors (residual\noscillations) in the result. Figure 1 suggests that ARIES\nshould provide a significant improvement in this respect,\nwhen processed data becomes available.\n[62] Direct comparison of the results with previous works\nis complicated by multiple definitions of the electron-\nneutral collision frequency. In the case of nM defined by\nSen and Wyller\u2019s magneto-ionic theory, an added inconsis-\ntency arises from the invalid assumptions of temperature\nindependent collisional cross-sections.\n[63] The corrected collision frequency profiles (Figure 7)\nare in close agreement with the results of Miyazaki [1975]\nfrom a geographic latitude of 69\u0001000S. This is close to the\nsouthern hemisphere latitude corresponding to Troms\u00f8\n(69\u0001350N), and confirms that the log linear altitude depen-\ndence assumed by Miyazaki [1975] is a reasonable approx-\nimation in the high-latitude D-region.\n[64] Acknowledgments.
