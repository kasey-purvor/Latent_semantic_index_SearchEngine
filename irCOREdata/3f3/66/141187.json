Introduction\nGroundwater is a key resource for agriculture, which uses approximately 9x105\nMm3 of groundwater in producing a global output valued at $210-$230 billion each\nyear (Shah et al., 2000). However, resulting over-abstraction is leading to falling\ngroundwater levels in many aquifers throughout the world. The sustainable\nmanagement of these underground resources requires that their use be attuned to their\nrate of replenishment through recharge, but which is becoming increasingly\nvulnerable to disruption due to climate change (IPCC 2007a). Although the large size\nand long residence times of many groundwater systems provide them with a buffer\nagainst short-term fluctuations, many systems are extremely vulnerable to the direct\nand indirect effects of climate change on their recharge (Holman 2006). Despite the\ngreat importance of groundwater for agriculture and this obvious vulnerability, there\nis widespread lack of quantification of the impacts that climate change is likely to\nhave on the resource (Dettinger and Earman, 2007; IPPC 2007b), as the Second, Third\nand Fourth Assessment Reports of the IPCC have recognized.\nGiven the inevitability of some degree of climate change, a number of authors\nhave proposed groundwater adaptation measures, both actual adjustments in practice\nand changes in decision-making environments (Mohapatra and Mitchell, 2009; Kelkar\net al., 2008; Crabbe and Robin, 2006; Tanaka et al., 2006). However, these\napproaches which rely on a strong ability to predict future risks or to foresee the\neventual outcomes of decisions are an inappropriate paradigm for conditions of\nsignificant spatiotemporal uncertainty. Some years ago, Rosenhead et al. (1972)\nsuggested the concept of robust decision-making, which incorporates flexibility in the\nway that decisions are taken in the face of multiple possible futures. Instead of a\n4prescriptive long-term plan for a certain future, the process involves drawing up a\nseries of \"small plans\"; and a decision-maker chooses only the first plan while\nkeeping the remaining plans open to revision as future conditions becomes clearer.\nThe concept is therefore similar to adaptive planning. However, there are as yet no\nstudies that explore how adaptive capacity can be developed to allow this kind of\ndecision-making to be integrated into groundwater management regimes.\nThis paper focuses on groundwater for irrigation in East Anglia, UK, and\nexamines how management practices that have recently been adopted at farm to\nnational scales in a situation of increasing uncertainty have increased adaptive\ncapacity. Also drawing on studies from other regions where farmers are facing a\nsimilar challenge, it identifies wider lessons for the development of groundwater\nmanagement systems which are able to adjust to climate change (including climate\nvariability and extremes) so as to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of\nopportunities, or to cope with the consequences (IPCC 2007b).\n2. Overview of the Region\nEast Anglia, located in eastern England (Figure 1), has a more \u2018continental\u2019\nclimate than the rest of the UK. Average annual rainfall and reference\nevapotranspiration are around \u2013600 mm and 530 mm, respectively. Rainfall is evenly\ndistributed throughout the year, with the main growing season extending from around\nMarch until October and the recharge period from December to March, inclusive.\nMost land lies below 60 m above sea level. As a consequence of its low-lying\ntopography, relatively dry climate, and fertile soils, this is the most intensively\ncultivated region in the UK. The extensive underlying aquifers, mainly the\n5unconfined Cretaceous chalk (Hiscock et al., 1996) and Pleistocene Crag (Holman et\nal., 1998) aquifers have allowed many farmers to benefit from groundwater irrigation.\n. Irrigation in the UK occurs on about 150 000 ha of land and, in a \u2018dry\u2019 year,\nuses approximately 160 Mm3 of water (Woods 2000). This represents less than 1.5%\nof total annual abstraction, but during peak periods irrigation can account for more\nthan 70% of abstraction in the intensively irrigated areas of East Anglia. Despite the\nsmall volumetric demand, supplemental irrigation is of great economic importance to\nfarmers and the food industry, as it greatly improves not just yields, but the quality,\nconsistency and reliability required by supermarkets and consumers.\nThe present system for abstraction control in England and Wales was introduced\nby the Water Resources Act of 1963, which replaced the earlier system of riparian\nrights. Licences are issued by the Environment Agency on a \u2018first come, first served\u2019\nbasis, with protection from derogation by new licences. Licences specify where and\nwhen water can be abstracted, the quantities that can be drawn out, and the use to\nwhich that water can be put, and they contain cessation clauses to protect other users\nand the environment. It is important to note that there is no provision in the law for\ncommunal rights, such as might be held in other countries, for example, by existing --\nand often ancient--communities of irrigators.\n3. Likely impacts of climate change\n. Climate change in East Anglia is projected to produce milder wetter winters\nand warmer drier summers, with an increased frequency and severity of extreme\nevents such as floods and droughts (Murphy et al. 2009). The projected changes will\nimpact directly on groundwater systems (Holman 2006) in a number of ways:\n61. Increased potential evapo-transpiration will lead to soils drying out\nsooner in the spring, bringing an earlier end to the winter recharge period;\n2. Drier summers and increased summer and autumn evapo-transpiration\nwill lead to a delay in the soils wetting up to field capacity, and hence to a\nfurther shortening of the recharge season;\n3. Increased potential evapo-transpiration in the winter will lead to\nincreased vegetation water use;\n4. Wetter winters may increase winter recharge;\n5. Increased rainfall intensity may lead to increased runoff and reduced\nrecharge;\n6. Increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations will increase the rate of\nphotosynthesis, reduce transpiration and dark respiration (MAFF, 2000; Drake\net al., 1997) and lead to increased usage efficiency of radiation and water.\n7. Salt water intrusion is unlikely to be a significant limit to groundwater\nabstraction in the region in the future.\nWhether future groundwater recharge increases or decreases in eastern England\nwill depend on whether the increased winter precipitation (central estimates of change\nof +12-16% by the 2050s across the emissions scenarios) compensates for the\nshortening of the recharge season of up to 6 weeks (Holman and Loveland, 2001).\nHowever, studies by Holman et al. (2005, 2009), Holman (2006) and Herrera-Pantoja\nand Hiscock (2008) suggest that future regional groundwater recharge will decrease\nby around 5-20% by the 2050s. The likely increasing demand for irrigation caused by\nclimate change (Weatherhead and Knox, 2000) will be in competition for water with\nother users (e.g., domestic consumers and the environment), whose demand for water\n7will also reflect climate change as well as other socio-economic changes (Henriques\net al., 2008; Environment Agency, 2001). A recent survey of irrigators by the\nNational Farmers Union (NFU, 2007) found that 58% of respondents were affected by\nthe most recent 2006 drought, of whom 61% see climate change as a threat to their\nfuture water use and 53% are concerned about planning for future droughts.\n4. Adaptation in groundwater irrigation management at national to farm\nscales\nThe abstraction licensing authority (the Environment Agency), like the\nirrigators, faces many challenges in managing for, and coping with, the potential\nimpacts of climate change. This uncertainty is recognised in the national Water\nResources Strategy (Environment Agency, 2009). However, whilst there is an\nexpectation that direct abstraction of groundwater for irrigation will become\nincreasingly less secure as a consequence of the impacts identified in Section 3, the\ncombination of uncertainty arising from the implementation of new European and\nnational policies, and the short-term economic pressures faced by agriculture, means\nthat few irrigators are taking action to cope with the anticipated future climate change.\nNevertheless, a number of actions have been implemented in recent years at national\nto farm scales to cope with current climatic variability. These actions and their\ncontribution to increasing adaptive capacity to the expected climate change are\nreviewed in the following sections.\n4.1 Changes to the abstraction licensing system\nThe Government publication \u201cTaking Water Responsibly\u201d (DETR and Welsh\nOffice, 1999) introduced changes in the abstraction licensing system. Foremost\n8among these was the proposal for the development of Catchment Abstraction\nManagement Strategies (CAMS), which aim \u201cto provide a framework for resource\navailability assessment\u201d and produce a \u201clicensing strategy which aids the sustainable\nmanagement of water resources on a catchment scale\u201d. Key elements of the CAMS\nare:\n\uf0b7 The resource assessment, resource availability status and sustainability\nappraisal components are within a 6-yearly water resource planning cycle. By\nproviding an indication of the availability of water resources within river\ncatchments taking into account the environmental needs of rivers and wetlands\n(Dunbar et al., 2004), CAMS highlight where additional abstraction may take\nplace \u2013 designated as \u201cwater available\u201d. They also identify where current\nlevels of licensed abstraction exceed the resources available- \u201cover-licenced\u201d\nor \u201cover-abstracted\u201d. Where this is the case, CAMS facilitate discussion of the\nmechanisms to regain a sustainable level of abstraction.\n\uf0b7 Abstraction decisions take place at a local level - catchments are\ndivided into water resource management units (WRMUs), which define the\nlargest subdivision of the aquifer or catchment that can be managed in the\nsame way;\n\uf0b7 The CAMS process makes more information on water allocation\npublicly available and allows a balance to be struck, in consultation with the\nlocal community and interested parties, between the needs of abstractors and\nthose of the aquatic environment (Dunbar et al., 2004).\n\uf0b7 Integration of surface and groundwater resources - a water balance is\ncalculated for each WRMU based on river flows, groundwater recharge,\nabstractions, discharges, and a resource allocation for the environment and any\n9other water uses or features that require protection. Managing surface and\ngroundwater resources within a single framework should allow more efficient\nconjunctive use;\n\uf0b7 CAMS should facilitate more licence trades in the future to encourage\na better utilisation of scarce resources (Environment Agency \/ Ofwat, 2009).\n\uf0b7 All new licences are issued on a time-limited basis, but with a\npresumption of renewal provided that the licensee continues to meet three\nrenewal tests- continued environmental sustainability (as determined by the\nCAMS process), continued justification of need (as demonstrated by the\nfarmer) and efficient use of water (by the farmer).\n4.2 Changes in the management of land overlying aquifers\nHigh and\/or rising nitrate levels in some groundwater management units in East\nAnglia is restricting the use of that groundwater for drinking water, putting increased\npressure on better quality groundwater in nearby units and reducing future adaptive\ncapacity. Traditionally, water policy and agricultural policy have been independent in\nEurope, but the European Nitrates Directive (91\/676\/EC), the Water Framework\nDirective (2000\/60\/EC) and the daughter Groundwater Directive (2006\/118\/EC) will\naffect the way that the land overlying aquifers is managed in order to enhance water\nquality:\n\uf0b7 The Nitrates Directive requires that all land draining into waters--both\nground and surface-- affected by nitrate pollution are designated as\nNitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs). In these areas an Action Programme\nof measures must be implemented to reduce nitrate losses within a 4\nyear review period: e.g., limiting application of inorganic and organic\n10\nfertilisers, and closing certain months to the use of slurry, sludge and\nmanure on high-risk soils.\n\uf0b7 The Water Framework Directive (WFD) establishes a strategic common\nframework for managing surface water and groundwater. Key\nenvironmental aims of the WFD for groundwater are: (1) to protect,\nenhance and restore polluted groundwater to \u2018good status\u2019 based on\ntargets for both quantity and quality, (2) to prevent or limit input of\npollutants into the groundwater, and (3) to reverse any significant\nupward trends in the concentration of particular pollutants. Most of the\ngroundwater units in East Anglia have been identified as being \u2018at risk\u2019\nof failing to meet the chemical content objectives, particularly from\ndiffuse source pollutants. The environmental objectives and the\nprogramme of delivery actions to meet them are embedded within a 6-\nyear cycle of River Basin Management Plans.\n4.3 Development of Water Abstractor Groups\nOver 1000 farms in eastern England, both large and small, depend on\nsupplemental irrigation in order to supply high quality produce for the market.\nHowever, agriculture is last in line when it comes to allocating water in times of\nsevere drought; domestic and industrial users and \u2018the environment\u2019 are given higher\npriority. To counterbalance this, irrigators arguably need to have a more coordinated\nand coherent voice at the local level in order to ensure that they get an adequate or\n\u2018fair\u2019 share of the available water resources at such times (Knox et al., 2007). In any\ndiscussion of what a \u2018fair\u2019 share might be, farmers must be able to demonstrate the\nimportance of water to agriculture and to the nation\u2019s food supply and security.\n11\nDeveloping farmers\u2019 institutional capacity to organize themselves to defend their\nwater rights is therefore central to ensuring the long-term future of irrigated farming\n(Leathes et al., 2009).\nFor many farmers in the east of England, working together to form Water\nAbstractor Groups (WAGs) is an effective way of creating a robust lobby to better\ndefend and secure their water rights, especially in the face of a growing risk of\nscarcity. Although a relatively new concept in UK agriculture (Rudge and Gowing,\n2002), many successful abstractor groups\u2014more often referred to as irrigation\ncommunities--are found throughout the world, often having been in existence for long\nperiods of time (e.g. Peru, Mexico, Spain, India, Nepal, the Philippines \u2013 Trawick,\n2003, 2008). Two examples of groundwater-focussed WAGs in East Anglia are the\nEast Suffolk Water Abstractors Group (ESWAG) and the Broadland Agricultural\nWater Abstractors Group (BAWAG).\nESWAG was formed in 1997, at a time when local irrigators felt threatened by a\npossible cessation order from the Environment Agency, which would curtail\nabstractions during a drought (Water Resources Act, 1991, Section 57). This resulted\nin a confrontation, in part because the two sides disagreed on the data that should be\nused in making decisions on the cutbacks. The irrigators felt powerless in the face of a\nregulator that they believed did not appreciate the importance of irrigation in the\nregion. Today, ESWAG provides a united and credible voice to put forward reasoned\narguments to the regulator within an open and cooperative relationship, which\nincreases their ability to meet future challenges (Knox et al., 2007).\nBAWAG has 170 members (representing around 80% of the area\u2019s abstractors),\nand was formed in 1998 in response to a slightly different set of concerns. Farmers\nwere troubled by proposed changes to the abstraction licensing procedure, by the\n12\nincreased difficulty that some were having in renewing existing licences, and by a\nsense that farmers needed to work together in order to represent effectively their\nmutual interest. Today BAWAG aims to maintain good dialogue with the\nEnvironment Agency, to participate in public consultations, and to promote best\nirrigation practices amongst their members, for which BAWAG was recognised at the\nEnvironment Agency Water Efficiency Awards 2007. Because members are now\nseen to be irrigating responsibly, a much better working relationship with the\nEnvironment Agency has emerged, making sudden and unexpected restrictions on\ntheir abstractions in times of future drought much less likely (Leathes et al., 2008).\nWhere Water Abstractor Groups have formed, farmers have come together to\ndefend their rights to irrigate, to build a direct channel of communication between\nthemselves and the regulator, to foster a firm commitment among members to use\nwater efficiently, and to provide a strong voice to influence future water policy.\nWAGs can facilitate an ongoing constructive dialogue with the Regulator on how best\nto use limited water resources in their catchments and how to deal with supply issues\nduring times of drought. Members of both groups are keenly aware that that their\nnegotiating power in this regard is much greater than that of irrigators who have not\norganized.\n4.4 Investment in more efficient irrigation technologies\nFarmers must now pass tests within the abstraction renewal process\ndemonstrating: 1) continued \u2018reasonable need\u2019 , and 2) efficient use of the abstracted\nwater . In this effort, farmers benefit greatly from being able to show that they are\nusing improved irrigation technologies and improved scheduling methods, both of\nwhich are being supported by a range of regionally and nationally funded initiatives,\nincluding workshops and published guides (e.g. Knox and Kay, 2007). Efficiency\n13\nimprovements are also occurring due to the significant typical total average costs for\napplying irrigation water of \u00a30.40\u2013\u00a30.45\/m3 for direct abstraction, and \u00a30.63\/m3 for\nwater stored in a farm reservoir (Knox et al., 2000), both of which include the full\nrecovery of the costs and Environment Agency charges.\nWeatherhead (2007) shows that there has been continual growth (up from 52%\nof the total irrigated area in 2001 to 60% in 2005) in the proportion of the region\nwhere irrigation is scientifically scheduled. The main approaches used are water\nbalance calculations and in-field soil moisture measurement. However, farmers still\nrely on their own judgement and on traditional indicators--e.g., feeling the soil,\ninspecting the crop, etc-- on 34 % of the total irrigated area. It is not clear whether\nscientific scheduling is leading to less water being used (as better management should\nallow a given area to be irrigated with a smaller volume, but could also allow an\nexpansion of the irrigated area ), but it does allow farmers to demonstrate \u2018efficient\nuse\u2019 to the Environment Agency. NFU (2007) found that 82% of respondents said\nthey were more aware of water efficiency than they were five years ago (62% in\n2001), and that 88% of farmers carry out at least one water saving tactic and 64% use\ntwo or more tactics.\nWeatherhead (2007) showed that hose-reel irrigation systems remain by far the\npredominant technology used by area (86%), but that the proportion irrigated by hose-\nreels fitted with booms rather than guns has increased slightly. Little change was\nobserved in the proportion of land watered using static or hand-moved sprinklers,\nspray lines, centre pivots or linear moves, and trickle or drip irrigation methods. This\ndiffers from NFU (2007) which showed a significant reduction in the area irrigated\nusing rain-guns, with a much greater area being irrigated using the alternative, more\nwater-efficient methods.\n14\nIt is likely that the increased awareness and application of water saving tactics\nresults from a sequence of events \u2013 the sudden past imposition of drought restrictions;\nthe increasing difficulty in getting new summer licences; the increased cost of energy-\nwhich has been reinforced by messages from the Environment Agency, the UK\nIrrigation Association, the National Farmers Union etc., about future climate change.\n4.5 Installation of on-farm reservoirs\nSeveral factors are adversely affecting the availability of water supplies for\nirrigation in the region, including more environmental protection requirements\nembedded in the CAMS and the WFD and increasing competition for water from\nother sectors. New licences for summer abstraction are now widely unobtainable. In\naddition, many existing summer water sources are becoming less reliable, as direct\nabstractions of groundwater for irrigation are vulnerable to the Section 57 cessation\norders during droughts, particularly where they are considered to impact low flows or\nwater levels in groundwater dependent ecosystems. A farmer given such an order to\ncease irrigating receives no compensation and so has major financial implications.\nFarmers are therefore increasingly interested in constructing on-farm reservoirs,\nas once water is in a reservoir, it is the farmer\u2019s to do with as (s)he wishes, thus\nproviding security of supply. Reservoirs are generally filled during the winter\nmonths, when groundwater levels and river flows are highest and abstraction charges\nare lowest- charges for winter abstraction are one-tenth of the cost of equivalent\nsummer abstraction.\nThe number and volume of on-farm reservoirs has shown a steady increase\nsince the mid 1970s (Figure 2). Weatherhead (2007) suggests that 42% of\nrespondents in England had at least some on-farm water storage. There were 1069\n15\nlicences in 2007 in the Anglian region for \u201cspray irrigation storage\u201d, which together\naccounted for 41% of the total annual volume licenced for spray irrigation\n(Weatherhead et al., 2008).\n5. Discussion\nIt is apparent from the preceding sections that a range of changes have been\nimplemented at different scales by farmers and other stakeholders in East Anglia:\n\uf0b7 National\ni. Changes to the abstraction licencing system- enabling adaptive\nmanagement;\nii. Changes to land management- reducing water quality threats to\ngroundwater resources.\n\uf0b7 Water resource management unit\ni. Development of Water Abstractor Groups- improving adaptive\ncapacity and social learning;\n\uf0b7 Farm\ni. Investment in more efficient irrigation technologies- reducing\ndemand, demonstrating efficient use;\nii. Installation of on-farm reservoirs- diversifying supply, reducing\nsummer abstraction demand, avoiding drought restrictions.\nThe question therefore becomes, to what extent are the practices consistent with\npurposeful adaptation? Do they build adaptive capacity and contribute to the\ndevelopment of resilient social systems (Carpenter et al., 2001)? And what barriers\nexist to further adaptation in groundwater management? Adaptation is not about\n16\nreturning to some prior state but about moving to some new acceptable alternative\nstate, as all social and natural systems evolve or co-evolve over time.\nAdger et al. (2005) suggest that most adaptation is reactive but that it can also\nbe anticipatory when based on some assessment of future conditions. Given that the\nidentified changes at farm to national scale are not in direct response to climate\nchange, and nor is climate change currently factored into the decision-making process,\nit is unlikely that these changes can be considered as purposeful or anticipatory\nadaptation. The new practices are therefore discussed with regard to how they act to\nincrease adaptive capacity.\n5.1 National-level\nThe control of diffuse and point source pollution is needed to ensure the\ncontinued aquifer-wide utility of groundwater for public water supply, thus ensuring\nthat irrigators do not lose out as public water companies seek new resources to replace\nthose lost by pollution. The changes in land management that will be necessary in\norder to meet the requirements of the Nitrates Directive and the WFD are not intended\nas a means of adapting to climate change. However, because climate change is likely\nto lower rates of groundwater recharge, and consequently reduce the capacity of\ngroundwater to dilute diffuse-source pollutants, the two are in fact closely related.\nClimate change is likely to make further modifications in practice necessary at the\nfarm level, but the cyclical planning and review process for the two Directives allows\nan adaptive management approach to reducing pollution and increasing the utility of\ngroundwater resources for future abstraction by farmers and, more generally, for\necosystem services.\n17\n5.2 Water resource management unit\nLocal individuals can often feel powerless within natural resource management\nsystems, particularly due to the lack of access to high-level stakeholders and decision\nmakers (Brown et al., 2001). The development of Water Abstractor Groups has been\nlargely a reaction against this, and is a form of collective action whereby the efforts\namong groups of individuals is co-ordinated to achieve a common goal (Trawick\n2008). However, the benefits of WAGs are greater than this, due to the capacity of\nsocial networks to enhance adaptive capacity (Tompkins and Adger, 2003).\nWAGs in East Anglia have invested in commissioning and disseminating\nresearch to their membership on irrigation efficiency, training, benchmarking, and\neconomic performance, all of which have helped to increase the capacity of their\nmembers to irrigate efficiently and derive improved economic returns. More mature\nWAG\u2019s such as the Lincoln Water Transfer Ltd have developed duties or\nresponsibilities for the collective management of their water resources (Leathes et al.\n(2009), which is unique evidence of evolutionary change within a WAG in the UK.\nThe capacity for learning and adaptation is evident within the WAGs and the\nwider policy frameworks. The increasing utilization of scientific scheduling, water\nsaving technologies and irrigator training encouraged by WAGs allows farmers to\ndemonstrate good practice in their dealings with the Environment Agency. This in\nturn lends credibility to their lobbying position and adds legitimacy to their requests to\nbe allowed to keep irrigating during dry periods. However, it would be advantageous\nfor WAGS to be able to work out a set of institutions for cutting back their\nabstractions on their own during droughts, as irrigator groups in other parts of the\n18\nworld are often able to do (Trawick, 2008), as an alternative to having them cut back\naltogether by the regulator.\n5.3 Farm-level\nThe ability of farms to buffer disturbances (i.e. droughts) is enhanced by\nreservoirs (which increase summer storage and allow irrigation demand and\nenvironmental demand to be increasingly de-linked and de-synchronised), by water\ntrading, by improved irrigation efficiencies (through increasing utilization of scientific\nscheduling and water-saving technologies), and by improved communication between\nthe regulator and the regulated, facilitated by WAGs. The improved information\nexchange between the regulator and irrigators is vital to avoid the significant\neconomic losses associated with sudden (and largely unexpected) restrictions on\nlicenses during droughts. Prior knowledge of the likelihood of restrictions (whether\ntotal or partial) allows farmers to apply coping strategies based on their individual\ncircumstances (Knox et al., 2000). These can be either short-term seasonal plans, or\nlonger-term strategic choices. Short-term plans might include re-scheduling the\ntiming of abstraction to preserve available water, re-scheduling the allocation of water\nto prioritise specific high-value crops, or modifying the irrigation application (depth)\nand\/or timing (interval between irrigations).\n5.4 Barriers and limitations\nAll of the above activities are increasing the adaptive capacity of the\ngroundwater irrigation sector to cope with anticipated climate change, but there are\nsignificant barriers or limitations. The construction of reservoirs and the installation\nof water saving technologies are long-term strategic developments and also major\n19\ncapital investments, which require confidence in the future availability of water,\nalthough reservoir-sharing has emerged as a means of spreading these costs and risks.\nUnder the current abstraction licensing system, abstractors can be sure of their licence\nfor no more than 12 years ahead. The combination of short-term economic\nuncertainties surrounding agricultural production, very limited state financial support\nfor capital investment, and future uncertainty over water availability provides\nsignificant investment barriers for many farmers. Future increases in temperature are\nlikely to lead to increased evaporative losses from such reservoirs which may not be\nrecognised is current designs.\nThe sharing of water resources through water rights\/allocation\/entitlements\ntrading has yet to develop in the UK, even though legislation allows it. This reflects\nin part uncertainty over the processes involved and the greater simplicity of existing\ninformal practices, in which farmers simply rent or purchase land that has an\nabstraction licence, thus getting access to the associated water. The potential for\nwater trading is large, as many abstraction licences are never or only partially used, so\nthat water trading could enable farmers to exploit available water resources more\nefficiently in space, especially if water rights can be traded. The danger, however, is\nthat in areas where water resources are already under pressure, the re-activation of so-\ncalled sleeper or unused licences could cause an even greater conflict between the\ninterests of \u2018the environment\u2019 and those of the abstractors. Avoiding this will require\nvery careful monitoring, and it may be necessary to revoke some licenses or prevent\ncertain trades from taking place in order to stabilise abstractions at a sustainable level\n(Weatherhead et al., 2005).\nThe abstraction opportunities afforded by better conjunctive use of surface and\ngroundwater require improved guidelines to make more use of the higher river flows\n20\nin the \u201cwetter\u201d winters and saving groundwater for when rivers are low; and\/or\nmaking better use of the difference in timing between high irrigation demand and low\ngroundwater levels (Weatherhead et al., 2005).\nDespite the many changes implemented, some irrigation is becoming more\nsensitive to climate change, as direct summer abstractors are increasingly subjected to\ntime-limited licences and the setting of hands-off levels (which trigger the cessation\nof abstraction in severe droughts). However, it is unlikely that the changes already\nimplemented will be sufficient to cope with the range of future water resource\noutcomes anticipated by climatic and socio-economic change (e.g. Holman et al.,\n2005).\n5.6 Maladaptation\nDespite abstraction licencing control to maintain resource sustainability, some\npotential maladaptation has emerged. Historically, trickle irrigation was exempt from\nthe need for an abstraction licence, such that the use of trickle increased fivefold\nbetween 1990 and 2001, accounting for about 5% of the volume of irrigation\nabstraction (Knox and Weatherhead, 2005). This growth was driven by the\ncommercial motivations, rather than the environmental benefits of water savings per\nse, but switching from spray to trickle irrigation was encouraged by government\n(Defra, 2002) and the regulator as a means of increasing water use efficiency.\nHowever, the increasing and unregulated volumes of water abstraction for trickle had\nimplications for water resource management, as much of the growth in water-short\ncatchments was on newly irrigated crops, for which a spray irrigation abstraction\nlicence would not have been issued (Knox and Weatherhead, 2005). Given the\npotential importance of these unregulated abstractions on water resource management,\n21\ntrickle irrigation had to be brought into the regulatory system with the Water Act of\n2003.\n5.7 Wider lessons\nAlthough this case study has assessed the irrigated sector of a single developed\ncountry, there are a number of lessons which have wider applicability:\n1. Approaches to water abstraction management needed to\nintegrated both horizontally (cross-sectoral harmonisation of policy and\npractice) and vertically (across the scales of governance involved in\nmanagement, from the local upwards to the national).\n2. The need for adaptive management \u2013 adapting for climate\nvariability\/climate change within the irrigated sector is not about a single\naction. Multiple approaches at different scales need to be embedded\nwithin an adaptive management framework which allows strategies and\nmanagement decisions to be updated in the light of changing\nunderstanding or conditions (Figure 3)\n3. Making best use of water resources which vary in space and\ntime \u2013 water is not necessarily available in the quantities desired at the\ntime or place it is needed. Actions which allow better use of resources by,\nfor example, offsetting the timing of peak demand and the timing of least\nresources (e.g. reservoirs), reducing demand (e.g. improved efficiency) or\nspatially separating demand from supply (e.g. water transfers) are\nobviously beneficial. However, many other actions will contribute to the\ngoal of making best use of water resources, such as good soil management\nand soil water conservation (to increase rooting depth, water infiltration,\n22\nsoil water storage); rainwater harvesting; managed aquifer recharge (e.g.\nrecharge dams) etc.\n4. The need to control all significant abstractions within a\nsustainable resource management framework, whether at national\n(regulatory) or at local (collective action Water Abstractor Group) scales,\nthat takes account of environmental needs;\n5. Demonstrating efficient use of scarce resources \u2013 by adopting\nwater saving technologies and improved irrigation scheduling, and\ncarrying out water audits to calculate the benefits of irrigation, irrigators\nare able to demonstrate that they are efficiently and productively using a\nscarce natural resource \u2013 getting \u201cmore crop per drop\u201d. This provides\nlegitimacy in irrigators\u2019 dealings with the authorities and reduces the risk\nof sudden abstraction restrictions, but can be done at both an individual\nand a group scale or level;\n6. Collective action \u2013 the coming together of many irrigators into\nWater Abstractor Groups produces a number of benefits \u2013 a single point of\ncontact for the authorities; increased lobbying power; increased potential\nfor improving practice and increasing efficiency, whether through training,\ndiscussion, benchmarking etc; sharing of facilities\/equipment; and the\nopportunity to develop institutions to proactively cut back abstractions\nduring droughts etc (Fig. 3).\n7. Reducing non-climate pressures \u2013 given the pressures of\nclimate change, it is important that non-climate pressures, such as diffuse\nsource pollution, which have the potential to reduce the utility of\ngroundwater, are reduced.\n23\n6. Conclusions\nIrrigation within the UK climate is predominantly supplemental, to ensure the\nhigh quality produce demanded by supermarkets and consumers. A range of\nimportant changes in groundwater management have been implemented at national to\nfarm scales by the regulator and the regulated agribusinesses. At a national scale,\ngroundwater abstractions are managed within the same regulatory framework as\nsurface water, with a cyclical resource assessment framework which facilitates\nadaptive management. National strategies for controlling diffuse source pollution are\nreducing water quality threats to groundwater resources and ensuring future utility.\nAt a water resource management unit scale, the development of Water Abstractor\nGroups is improving the adaptive capacity of rural agricultural businesses and\nempowering the irrigated agricultural sector within the water resource planning cycle.\nFinally, at farm scales, irrigators are investing in more efficient irrigation technologies\nand installing on-farm reservoirs to diversify supply and reduce summer abstraction\ndemand. The implementation of these is not directly driven by climate change\n(although the publicity around climate change is certainly affecting expectations about\nfuture water availability), but all are increasing the adaptive capacity of the irrigation\nsector to cope with the anticipated but uncertain impacts of climate change.\n7.
