It will be possible\nto irradiate these ions with ultraintense laser pulses pro-\nduced by the PHELIX laser facility, currently developed\non the same site, which has a working wavelength of\n1053.7 nm and a peak intensity above 1021 W cm\u00032. In\nwhat follows, we shall assume that the laser beam is\noriented so that it counterpropagates with respect to the\ndirection of motion of the beam of ions, which will be\nfeasible at GSI. Because of the relativistic Doppler effect,\nthe ions are then exposed in their frame of reference\n(moving with respect to the laboratory frame with a\nspeed v \u0004 c) to a laser field of angular frequency !I\u0002\n\u00051\u0001v=c\u0006\u0001!L and electric field amplitude FI\u0002\u00051\u0001\nv=c\u0006\u0001FL, where \u0001\u0002\u00051\u0003v2=c2\u0006\u00031=2 is the Lorentz factor\nand !L and FL are the angular frequency and electric\nfield amplitude of the laser pulse in the laboratory frame.\nAn important question is the efficacy, in these condi-\ntions, of multiphoton processes [1] such as high-order\nabove-threshold ionization, multiple ionization, and\nhigh-order harmonic generation. In this Letter, we exam-\nine the process of high-order harmonic generation which,\nat the single-ion level, is similar to the other two in\narising from the same three-step mechanism [2,3]. In\nthe first step, the active electron is detached from the\ncore through tunneling ionization or \u2018\u2018over the barrier\u2019\u2019\nionization. In the second step, it propagates in the con-\ntinuum like a \u2018\u2018quasifree\u2019\u2019 electron accelerated by the\nlaser field. In the third step, the electron interacts with\nthe core if it comes back to its vicinity. At this point, the\nelectron may (i) be simply scattered, which leads to high-\norder above-threshold ionization, or (ii) knock out other\natomic electrons, which leads to multiple ionization, or\n(iii) recombine radiatively, which leads to the emission of\nan energetic photon, corresponding to high-order har-\nmonic generation. It has been established recently [4\u20137]\nthat these three-step processes are inhibited at high in-\ntensities by the Lorentz force exerted by the magnetic-\nfield component of the laser pulse, which tends to push the\nelectron in the direction of propagation of the pulse, away\nfrom the core. This inhibition is particularly severe for\nelectrons returning towards the core with a high relative\nvelocity. In the conditions that can be achieved at GSI,\nhowever, and as we prove in this Letter, the inhibition is\nmuch attenuated, for the same relative velocity, by the\nDoppler boost in frequency arising from the relativistic\nmotion of the ions [8].\nOur calculations are carried out using the nonrelativ-\nistic, nondipole strong field approximation (SFA) we pro-\nposed recently [5,9]. Within this approach, the instan-\ntaneous dipole moment of the ion interacting with the\nlaser field is given, in the rest frame of the ion, by the\nexpression [9,10]\nd \u0005t\u0006 \u2019 \u00032ImX\ntd\na\brec\u0005t; td\u0006apr\u0005t; td\u0006aion\u0005t; td\u0006: (1)\nThe sum runs over detachment times, td, for which the\ndetached electron comes back to the core at time t. The\nionization amplitude aion\u0005t; td\u0006, the propagation amplitude\napr\u0005t; td\u0006, and the recombination amplitude a\brec\u0005t; td\u0006 are\nobtained in the way described in Refs. [9,10]. However, in\nthe present work we correct the SFA for the Coulomb\npotential of the core.We assume that the electron interacts\nwith the core through a pure Coulomb potential, \u0003Z=r,\nwith Z \u0002 \u00052Ip\u00061=2, Ip being the ionization potential of the\ninitial state. (Atomic units are assumed throughout this\nLetter, unless specified otherwise.) The ionization ampli-\ntude is calculated using the correction proposed by\nKrainov [11] for taking into account the effect of the\nCoulomb barrier on the tunneling electron. Accordingly,\nPRL 93, 243603 (2004) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending10 DECEMBER 2004\n0031-9007=04=93(24)=243603(4)$22.50 243603-1 \uf6d9 2004 The American Physical Society\nour aion\u0005t; td\u0006 is a factor \u00058Ip\u00063=4=\u0005\u0011FI\u00061=2 larger than the\nionization amplitude given in Ref. [9]. The recombination\namplitude is obtained by using the impulse approxima-\ntion [12]. Namely, the amplitude is calculated assuming a\nCoulomb wave with incoming wave behavior rather than\na plane wave for the spatial part of the wave function\ndescribing the returning continuum electron. The\nCoulomb interaction is taken into account in different\nways in the ionization amplitude and the recombination\namplitude because the corresponding steps are physically\ndifferent: at the ionization stage, the electron escapes\nfrom the core with essentially zero velocity, while at the\nrecombination stage it moves at high velocity. We have\ntested this procedure by comparing the Coulomb-\ncorrected SFA photon emission spectrum with the result\nof a numerically exact integration of the time-dependent\nSchro\u00a8dinger equation [13], for the case of an He\u0001 ion\nat rest in the laboratory and irradiated by an ultrashort\nTi-sapphire pulse (v \u0002 0, !I \u0002 !L \u0002 0:057 a:u:, FI \u0002\nFL \u0002 0:534 a:u:). Illustrative results are presented in\nFig. 1, where the squared modulus of the Fourier trans-\nform of the dipole moment is plotted against the har-\nmonic order q for q up to 400 (q \u0002 \u0019I=!I, where \u0019I is\nthe angular frequency of the emitted photon). The low-\nenergy part of the spectrum, for q < 40, is dominated by\nbound-bound transitions. The rest of the spectrum arises\nfrom the three-step mechanism outlined above and can be\nreadily understood by analyzing the classical trajectories\nof the detached electrons [14]. Except in the troughs of\nthe oscillation, the Coulomb correction significantly im-\nproves the agreement of the SFA results with the exact\nresults. (The same can also be said for the high energy\npart of the spectrum, not shown in Fig. 1, although in this\ncase differences by up to a factor of 3 exist between the\nCoulomb-corrected SFA and the ab initio results.)\nLet us now return to the case of relativistic ions. In\norder to examine how the relativistic Doppler boost af-\nfects three-step recollisional processes, we compare pho-\nton emission by two ions exposed to the same laboratory\nlaser field. We assume that the first ion is at rest in the\nlaboratory, while the second is moving relativistically in\nthe direction opposite to the laser pulse. The latter is\nmodeled as a monochromatic electromagnetic field of\nwavelength \u0014L \u0002 1053:7 nm and constant intensity IL \u0002\n1017 W cm\u00032 in the laboratory frame. This intensity is\nhigh enough for the magnetic-field induced suppression of\nrecollision to be significant, so that nondipole effects\nmust be taken into account, but not so high as to invali-\ndate the nonrelativistic character of our nondipole SFA\n[9]. The ponderomotive energy, Up \u0002 F2L=\u00054!2L\u0006 \u0002\nF2I =\u00054!2I \u0006, is 10.4 keV. The maximum energy of the pho-\ntons emitted by the ion, in the ion\u2019s rest frame, is Ip \u0001\n3:17Up [3]. (Neither the ponderomotive energy, nor the\nKeldysh adiabaticity parameter \u0001K \u0002 !LZ=FL \u0002\n!IZ=FI, depend on the speed of the ions.) The first ion\nis a sodiumlike Ar7\u0001 ion (Z \u0002 3:247, Ip \u0002 143 eV),\nwhich is assumed to be at rest in the laboratory frame\n(\u0001 \u0002 1). For the laser parameters chosen here, this ion\nexperiences an ionization loss of about 2% per optical\ncycle. The laser intensity is thus close to saturation. The\ncorresponding Keldysh parameter is \u0001K \u0002 0:08. The sec-\nond ion is a hydrogenlike Ne9\u0001 ion (Z \u0002 10, Ip \u0002\n1:36 keV), assumed to move in the laboratory frame\nwith a Lorentz factor \u0001 \u0002 15. The ionization loss per\ncycle, in this case, is about 1%. (This species was chosen\nbecause at \u0001 \u0002 15 it ionizes in the field at about the same\nrate as Ar7\u0001 at \u0001 \u0002 1, which facilitates the comparison.)\nThe Keldysh parameter is 0.26, sufficiently small that the\nSFA can still be expected to be adequate. Owing to the\nDoppler boost in intensity, the Ar7\u0001 ion would be\npromptly ionized if moving at \u0001 \u0002 15 against the laser\npulse.

Two sets of results are shown for each ion, namely,\nthe results obtained within the dipole approximation\n(where the effect of the magnetic-field component of the\nlaser field is neglected), and the results obtained with the\nmagnetic field taken into account within our nondipole\nSFA. In the case of Ar7\u0001, the magnetic field reduces the\nintensity of emission by about 3 orders of magnitude in\nthe high energy part of the spectrum. This dramatic\nreduction, and also the bending of the plateau, disappear-\nance of intermediate cutoffs and of the oscillations mark-\ning the dipole spectrum, are well-known nondipole\neffects and are readily explained within the semiclassical\ntheory of three-step processes [7,9]. The difference be-\ntween dipole and nondipole spectra is much smaller for\nNe9\u0001. In particular, and despite the higher intensity, there\nis no significant decrease in the efficiency of the harmonic\nemission as compared to the dipole calculation. Also\nstriking is the much larger intensity of emission.\nThe higher emission efficiency of Ne9\u0001 has a double\norigin: It is due both to the larger recombination ampli-\ntude, which is proportional to Z5=2, and to the lesser\nspreading of the electronic wave packet between the\ntime of detachment and the time of recombination. (In\nthe frame of reference of the ion, the difference between\nthese 2 times is smaller by a factor 30 for \u0001 \u0002 15.) We\nexpect that the adverse effect of wave packet spreading on\nthe efficiency of high-order above-threshold ionization\n(ATI) and nonsequential double ionization would be simi-\nlarly reduced by going to relativistic velocities.\nThe relative weakness of the nondipole effects in the\ncase of Ne9\u0001 originates from the dependence of the\nionization amplitude aion\u0005t; td\u0006 on the magnetic field and\non the ionization potential of the initial state. The largest\npart of the difference between the value of aion\u0005t; td\u0006 in the\ndipole approximation and its nondipole value can be\ntraced to an exponential factor this amplitude is propor-\ntional to. In the ion\u2019s rest frame, one has [4,9]\njaion\u0005t; td\u0006j2 \/ w\u0005pk\u0006 \u0002 exp\n\u0002\n\u0003 2\n3\n\u00052Ip \u0001 p2\u00063=2\njFI\u0005td\u0006j\n\u0003\n; (2)\nwhere FI\u0005td\u0006 is the electric field at the time of detachment\nand pk is the momentum in the laser propagation direc-\ntion that an electron must have at time td to return to the\ncore at time t.

In the dipole\napproximation, the probability for the active electron to\nbe ionized and to return to the core at high velocity is\nsimilar for the two ions: taking FI\u0005td\u0006 equal to the elec-\ntric field amplitude, we obtain w\u0005pk \u0002 0\u0006 \u0002 1:4\t 10\u00036\nfor Ar7\u0001 at \u0001 \u0002 1 and w\u0005pk \u0002 0\u0006 \u0002 1:9\t 10\u00036 for Ne9\u0001\nat \u0001 \u0002 15.

While the\nprobability of returning to the ionic core is reduced for\nboth ions when the laser\u2019s magnetic field is taken into\naccount, it is much less reduced for Ne9\u0001 than for Ar7\u0001.\nWe note, with the authors of Ref.

In the\nlaboratory frame, the intensity is 1017 W cm\u00032 and the wave-\nlength is 1053.7 nm.\nPRL 93, 243603 (2004) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending10 DECEMBER 2004\n243603-3\nabout \u00112k=\u000e2jFI\u0005td\u0006j\u000f in the nondipole SFA. Hence, the\nlarger jFI\u0005td\u0006j, for a constant \u0011k, the smaller the correc-\ntion. It is thus more likely that the electron is ejected with\nthe necessary longitudinal momentum.\nThe ratio w\u0005\u0011k\u0006=w\u00050\u0006 therefore indicates how much the\nprocess is suppressed by the magnetic-field component of\nthe laser pulse: the smaller this ratio, the larger the\nsuppression [4,16]. The probability of a high energy re-\ncollision is insignificant unless \u00112k\u00052Ip\u00061=2=FI\u0005td\u0006 is small\nenough, and in the same time Ip is large enough for the\nion to sustain the high intensities required but not that\nlarge that no ionization occurs. Assuming a driving field\nin the infrared, the former condition can be fulfilled, in\nprinciple, by taking \u0001 large enough. This last point is\nillustrated by Fig. 3, which gives the ratio w\u0005\u0011k\u0006=w\u00050\u0006 for\nreturning electrons with maximal kinetic energy (i.e.,\n3.17 Up). As above, the wavelength of the driving field\nis 1053.7 nm in the laboratory. Results are presented for\nions either at rest or moving at \u0001 \u0002 5, 15, or 30. The ion\nspecies, and hence the value of Ip, is chosen in such a way\nthat the ionization loss per cycle is 2% and is therefore\ndifferent for different values of \u0001 and Up. The diagram\nshows that the range of return energies for which recol-\nlision is not severely suppressed can be extended signifi-\ncantly by using relativistic ions.\nWe note, to conclude, that the smaller importance of\nthe nondipole effects at large Lorentz factors illustrated\nhere for high-order harmonic generation can also be ex-\npected for high-order ATI or nonsequential double ion-\nization, as it originates from the ionization stage of the\nprocess and this stage is virtually identical for all three-\nstep processes. We stress that this smaller importance is\nnot a relativistic effect per se. The speed of the ions\nintervenes only through the Doppler effect, which makes\nit possible to detach electrons from multicharged ions at\nhigh intensity without imposing a large magnetic drift to\nthese electrons. Clearly, identical results would be ob-\ntained by irradiating ions at rest by a laser field of\nsufficiently high intensity and sufficiently high frequency.\nThis work was supported by the UK EPSRC.
