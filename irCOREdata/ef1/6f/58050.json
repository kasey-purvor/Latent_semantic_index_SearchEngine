Hofmann\nResearch Domain I, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Potsdam, Germany\nM. A. Morales Maqueda\nProudman Oceanographic Laboratory (Natural Environment Research Council), Liverpool, United Kingdom\nGeothermal heating of abyssal waters is rarely regarded\nas a significant driver of the large-scale oceanic circulation.\nNumerical experiments with the Ocean General Circulation\nModel POTSMOM-1.0 suggest, however, that the impact of\ngeothermal heat flux on deep ocean circulation is not negligi-\nble. Geothermal heating contributes to an overall warming\nof bottom waters by about 0.4 \u25e6C, decreasing the stability\nof the water column and enhancing the formation rates of\nNorth Atlantic Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water by\n1.5 Sv (10% ) and 3 Sv (33% ), respectively. Increased influx\nof Antarctic Bottom Water leads to a radiocarbon enrich-\nment of Pacific Ocean waters, increasing \u220614C values in the\ndeep North Pacific from -269\u25e6\/\u25e6\u25e6 when geothermal heating\nis ignored in the model, to -242\u25e6\/\u25e6\u25e6 when geothermal heat-\ning is included. A stronger and deeper Atlantic meridional\noverturning cell causes warming of the North Atlantic deep\nwestern boundary current by up to 1.5 \u25e6C.\n1. Introduction\nGeothermal heating through the seafloor adds only a very\nsmall contribution to the oceanic energy budget. The aver-\nage geothermal heat flux currently entering the oceans is\nestimated to be between 93 to 101 mW m\u22122 (1 mW = 10\u22123\nW) (Pollack et al. [1993]). In comparison, sea surface turbu-\nlent and radiative heat fluxes can be hundreds to thousands\nof times larger (Huang [1999]). Geothermal heating is also a\nseemingly lesser player from the point of view of the oceanic\nmechanical energy budget. Of the 2 TW (1 TW = 1012\nW) of mechanical energy injected into the ocean by winds\nand tides, approximately 0.4 TW are directly available for\nturbulent mixing, that increases the available potential en-\nergy of the ocean and partly fuels the Meridional Overturn-\ning Circulation, or MOC (Huang [1999]; Kuhlbrodt et al.\n[2007]). In comparison, Huang [1999, 2002] found that the\npotential energy geothermal heating can generate is almost\n10 times smaller: 0.05 TW. In spite of the small energies\nassociated with geothermal heating, geothermal heat fluxes\nmight have a measurable effect on the large-scale circulation\nand tracer distribution (Adkins et al. [2005]; Huang and Jin\n[2002];Mullarney et al. [2006]; Roussenov et al. [2004]). The\nreason for this is that, unlike surface heat fluxes, geothermal\nfluxes, however small, are unidirectional, always contribut-\ning towards increasing the buoyancy of the deep ocean. In\naddition, geothermal heat sources are situated at the bot-\ntom, while buoyancy losses occur at the surface, a config-\nuration which, according to Sandstro\u00a8m\u2019s Theorem (Huang\n[1999]), supports a closed MOC.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/08\/$5.00\nNumerical studies with ocean circulation models of vari-\nous complexities have found that oceanic geothermal heating\ncan create bottom waters several tenths of a degree warmer\nthan would exist in its absence, and help maintain a vigor-\nous abyssal circulation (Mullarney et al. [2006]; Huang and\nJin [2002]; Adcroft et al. [2001]). It has also been argued\nby Roussenov et al. [2004] that, since oceanic concentra-\ntions of natural radiocarbon, notably in the Pacific Basin,\nare strongly controlled by the export rate of Antarctic Bot-\ntom Water (AABW), geothermal heating should affect the\nglobal distribution of \u220614C.\nAdcroft et al. [2001] investigates the impact of geother-\nmal heating on the simulated MOC of a global ocean gen-\neral circulation model (OGCM) with realistic topography.\nThey found a 25 % increase in the amount of AABW that\nenters the Indo-Pacific Ocean upon application of a uniform\ngeothermal heat flux of 50 mW m\u22122. In their study, the\ndeep North Pacific region experiences the most pronounced\nwarming, with a temperature rise of up to 0.4 \u25e6C . The study\nof Adcroft et al. [2001] used a spatially uniform geothermal\nheating source. However, geothermal heat fluxes vary con-\nsiderably in space. The global compilation of geothermal\nheat fluxes of Pollack et al. [1993] shows that maximum\nvalues of up to 325 mW m\u22122 occur along the geologically\nyoung crests of the ocean ridges (Fig. 1(a)) and that, as the\noceanic crust ages away from the ridges, geothermal heat\nfluxes decline to a background value of about 50 mW m\u22122.\nAccording to this data set, the global mean of the geother-\nmal heat flux through the seabed is 101 mW m\u22122, which is\nabout twice the value used by Adcroft et al. [2001].\nIn this article, we revisit the problem of assessing the\nimpact that geothermal heating has on the MOC and the\noceanic distribution of \u220614C. We use a global ocean climate\nmodel and compare results from experiments with and with-\nout geothermal heat fluxes.\nThese results of our study mainly confirm the findings\nmade by Adcroft et al. [2001], reach, however, beyond them.\nBesides the circulation and temperature changes we obtain,\nwhich tend to be larger than theirs, we find an intensification\nof the Atlantic MOC by 10 % accompanied by a deepening\nof the NADW cell by up to 500 meters and a warming of the\ndeep North Atlantic western boundary current by up to 1.5\n\u25e6C . The most striking feature in our simulations is a cool-\ning of the deep Weddell Sea by up to 0.3\u25e6C caused by the\ngeothermally enhanced convection in the Southern Ocean.\n2. Model and experimental design\nThe model is an ocean-sea ice general circulation model\ncoupled to an anomaly model of the atmospheric energy-\nmoisture balance (Hofmann and Maqueda [2006]). The\nocean model is the Modular Ocean Model, version 3.0, fea-\nturing a number of modifications outlined in Hofmann and\nMaqueda [2006]. Henceforth, this model will be referred to\nas the Potsdam version of MOM, version 1.0 (POTSMOM-\n1.0). The horizontal model grid has a uniform resolution of\n3\u25e6\u00d72\u25e6 . In the vertical, the grid consists of 29 levels with\n1\nX - 2 HOFMANN AND MORALES MAQUEDA: GEOTHERMAL FLUXES AND OCEAN CIRCULATION\nFigure 1. (a) Geothermal heat fluxes of Pollack et al.\n[1993] (in mW m\u22122) and (b) Temperature difference at\n3500 m between experiments GEOVAR and CNTRL av-\neraged over the last 200 years of integration (in \u25e6C).\nthickness increasing from 10 m at top to 405 m at the bot-\ntom. The model includes an empirical parameterization of\nbottom-enhanced vertical mixing (Hasumi and Suginohara\n[1999]), with a low background diffusivity of 0.1 cm2 s\u22121.\nIsopycnic Redi stirring is set to 1.25 \u00d7 107 cm2 s\u22121, while\nGent-McWilliams thickness diffusivities vary between 0.275\nand 0.55 107 cm2 s\u22121. The ocean model tracers are poten-\ntial temperature, salinity and radiocarbon (Toggweiler et al.\n[1989]).\nThree 5000-year experiments were run with this model.\nFirst, the control run (CNTRL) ignores geothermal heating.\nIn the second run (GEOVAR), the non-uniform geothermal\nheat distribution of Pollack et al. [1993] (GEOVAR), shown\nin Fig. 1(a), was used. To test the effect of a homogeneous\nforcing a third experiment (GEOCONST) was conducted\nwith a spatially uniform geothermal heat flux of 101.0 mW\nm\u22122, the global average of the geothermal flux in GEOVAR.\nResults from the last 200 years of integration are presented\nhere.\n3. Results\nIn accord with the results of Adcroft et al. [2001] and the\nidealized experiments of Scott et al. [2001], our simulations\nshow that, on global average, geothermal heating leads to\na warming of waters below the main thermocline by a few\ntenths of degree Celsius (0.26 \u25e6C for GEOVAR and 0.22 \u25e6C\nfor GEOCONST). Parts of the cold newly formed AABW\nleave the deep Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), move\nnorthward and enter the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Basins\nat about 40\u25e6 S. As this bottom water masses flow further\nnorth, they gradually gain heat from the geothermal sources\nat the sea floor.\nAt a depth of 3500 m, the warming in the Pacific Ocean\nand in the eastern Atlantic Ocean simulated by GEOVAR\namounts to 0.3 to 0.4 degrees (see Fig. 1(b)). Far away from\nthe strong geothermal sources of the mid-ocean ridges, the\nwarming patterns calculated in experiment GEOCONST\nare very similar to those of GEOVAR. This is explained\nby the fact that geothermal warming is an integrative pro-\ncess: whether it occurs progressively, as a result of a uniform\nheat flux (GEOCONST), or discontinuously, as waters move\nthroughout hot and cold spots (GEOVAR) is immaterial, as\nlong as the total heat absorbed is the same in both cases.\nResults from GEOVAR and GEOCONST qualitatively\ndepart from those discussed in Adcroft et al. [2001] in two\nremarkable ways. Firstly, the deep Southern Ocean, with\nthe exception of the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas,\nexperiences a cooling of up to \u22120.3 \u25e6C. Secondly, the deep\nwestern boundary current in the North Atlantic warms by\nbetween 0.9 \u25e6C and 1.5 \u25e6C. Salinity changes of about \u22120.1\nFigure 2. (a) Observed natural \u220614C (in \u25e6\/\u25e6\u25e6 ) at\n150\u25e6 W from the Global Ocean Data Analysis Project,\nGLODAP (Key et al. [2004]). (b) Color: as in (a) but\nsimulated in CNTRL. Contours: 200-year mean of Indo-\nPacific meridional overturning transport north of 34 S (in\nSv) in CNTRL. The contour interval is 2 Sv. (c) As in\n(b) but simulated in GEOVAR.\nHOFMANN AND MORALES MAQUEDA: GEOTHERMAL FLUXES AND OCEAN CIRCULATION X - 3\npsu in the Southern Ocean and +0.1 psu in the North At-\nlantic accompany these temperature changes (not shown).\nThe seemingly paradoxical cooling of the deep Southern\nOcean in GEOVAR and GEOCONST is caused by an inten-\nsification of open ocean deep convection in these simulations.\nIn all three model experiments, the occurrence of open ocean\ndeep convection in the Southern Ocean is a prevailing fea-\nture. The main area of convection, with winter mixed layers\noften stretching down to the seafloor, sits astride the eastern\nlimb of the Weddell Sea Gyre, and is centered around the\nGreenwich Meridian at 65\u25e6S. Smaller convection areas occur\nover the Cosmonaut Sea and the western Ross Sea, off Cape\nAdare. The convective activity in the Weddell Sea exhibits\na striking inter-decadal variability. Experiment CNTRL re-\npeatedly reveals the occurrence of open deep convection cov-\nering a maximum area of about 6\u00d7105 km2 and lasting for\nabout 20 years followed by a convection free period for about\n30 years. In case of GEOCONST and GEOVAR the area of\nthis intermittent deep convection almost triples, while the\ntime period of the convective activity increases by a factor\nof two (not shown). We do not yet fully understand the\nfactors that control the frequency and intensity of the in-\ntermittent convection events, but, clearly, the more intense\ndeep convection in GEOVAR and GEOCONST gives rise to\nhigher rates of formation and export of AABW (Fig. 2 b and\nc). Convection episodes are associated with strong sea ice\nmelt and the formation of embayments in the sea-ice cover\nthat, in the Weddell Sea, occasionally close into a polynya,\na feature also captured in the modeling study of Goosse\nand Fichefet [2001], although their polynya reappeared ev-\nery winter. While the formation of recurrent polynyas in\nthe Weddell and Cosmonaut Seas is well documented (e.g.,\nFigure 3. (a) Color fill of 200-year mean of zonally av-\neraged \u03c32 (in kg m\n\u22123) and contours of 200-year mean of\nmeridional overturning transport (in Sv) in the Atlantic\nOcean north of 34 S for CNTRL. (b) As in (a), but dif-\nference between GEOVAR and CNTRL.\nMoore et al. [2002], Geddes and Moore [2007]), the decadal\ncyclicity of the simulated polynyas and associated convec-\ntion episodes is probably unrealistic, however, can not be\nentirely excluded because of the paucity of observational\ndata.\nThe impact of geothermal heating on AABW circulation\nis most prominent in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. In CNTRL,\nthe northbound flow of AABW at 30\u25e6S is 10 Sv, while in\nGEOVAR and GEOCONST this flow increases by about 40\n% thus leading to a more vigorous ventilation of the deep\nNorth Pacific compared to CNTRL (Fig. 2 b and c). This\nresult is in qualitative agreement with Adcroft et al. [2001],\nwho, with a mean geothermal heat flux equal to roughly half\nours, reported an increase of 25% in deep AABW flow into\nthe Indo-Pacific. A larger export of AABW is expected to\ndecrease the age of North Pacific waters, and this is borne\nout by the fact that the deep \u220614C minimum of -269 \u25e6\/\u25e6\u25e6\nin CNTRL, increases in GEOVAR to -242 \u25e6\/\u25e6\u25e6(Fig. 2 b\nand c), a value that compares well with recent observational\ndata Key et al. [2004] (Fig. 2 a).\nThe warming of the deep western boundary current\nshown in Fig. 1(b) is the manifestation of a deepening of\nthe North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) overturning cell\nby 300 to 500 m, which also causes an increase in salinity\nand in \u220614C (by up to 14 \u25e6\/\u25e6\u25e6 not shown). This deepen-\ning results from the increased contrast between the density\nof newly formed NADW and that of the AABW reaching\nthe North Atlantic, which is as much as 0.1 kg m\u22123 lighter\nin GEOVAR than in CNTRL (Fig. 3b). Ultimately, up-\nwelling of this lighter water in the Southern Ocean creates a\nstronger meridional density contrast in GEOVAR compared\nto CNTRL, and a concomitant increase of 1.5 Sv (10 % )\nin the strengths of the Atlantic MOC maximum and 30\u25e6S\noutflow.\n4. Conclusions\nNumerical experiments with a coarse resolution ocean-\nsea ice model indicate that geothermal heat fluxes are a\nnon negligable forcing of the ocean circulation, substan-\ntially strengthening the AABW and NADW overturning\ncells. Geothermal heating stimulates convective activity in\nthe Southern Ocean and, consequently, increases the rate of\nformation and export of AABW by 33 % . While the re-\ncurrent open ocean convection that produces most of the\nAABW in the model has rarely been observed, there is in-\ndirect evidence that sporadic thermobaric convection could\nindeed substantially contribute to the formation of AABW\n(McPhee [2003]). This enhanced production of AABW leads\nto a better representation of the distribution of natural\n\u220614C. In a recent study, Matsumoto and Key [2004] pointed\nout that, in ocean models with vertical diffusivities as low\nas observed, such as ours, the deep ocean will become less\nventilated, and natural \u220614C values will thus be underesti-\nmated. Here we have shown that the inclusion of geothermal\nheat fluxes can partly correct this pathological behavior. We\nhave also reason to believe that the simulation of CFCs (e.g.\nBroecker et al. [1999]), and maybe other tracers, will as well\nbe improved thanks to the enhanced ocean ventilation af-\nforded by the inclusion of geothermal heat fluxes. Geother-\nmal heat fluxes also intensify by around 10 % both the max-\nimum of the Atlantic MOC and the outflow of NADW into\nthe Southern Ocean, while the penetration depth of NADW\nin the North Atlantic is increased from 2500 m to a more\nrealistic 3000 m.\nAcknowledgments.
