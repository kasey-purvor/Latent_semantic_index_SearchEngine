Introduction \n  \nSea level change is an important scientific topic, closely linked to studies of climate \nchange, solid earth processes and geodetic science. It is of great interest to government \nand the general public because of the possible impacts of sea level rise on the coast and \nthe associated costs of coastal protection. \n \nThis paper provides estimates of long term sea level change as observed in records of the \nUK National Tide Gauge Network. A major review of changes in UK mean sea level \n(MSL) was undertaken almost a decade ago by Woodworth et al. (1999). That report \nconcluded that sea level had been rising around our coasts during the 20th century at rates \nconsistent with knowledge of vertical land movements obtained from geological data, \ntogether with an additional 1 mm\/year. That amount was compatible with, if at the lower \nend of the range of, the 1-2.5 mm\/year estimated for global sea level change by the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Second Assessment Report (Warrick \net al., 1996). That conclusion was unchanged by the modified range for 20th century \nglobal sea level change of 1-2 mm\/year in the IPCC Third Assessment Report (Church et \nal., 2001). \n \nSince then, there have been major workshops (e.g. World Climate Research Programme \nworkshop on Sea Level Rise and Variability, Church et al., 2007a), reviews by individual \nscientists (e.g. Woodworth et al., 2004), and, most recently, the publication of the IPCC \n 4\nFourth Assessment Report (Bindoff et al., 2007). A consensus seems to have been \nachieved that the 20th century rise in global sea level was closer to 2 than 1 mm\/year, \nwith values around 1.7 mm\/year having been obtained recently for the past century \n(Church and White, 2006) or past half-century (Church et al., 2004; Holgate and \nWoodworth, 2004).  \n \nAs almost a decade has passed since the last major UK investigation of this topic, it is \nreasonable to examine the evidence for long term sea level change once again from a \nnational perspective. In particular, in the study of Woodworth et al. (1999), the shorter \nsea level records available were not able to contribute in a major way to the analysis. In \nthe present study, the records are now several years longer and a serious attempt has been \nmade to make more effective use of them. The last decade has also seen great advances in \nthe development of advanced geodetic techniques for measuring vertical land movements \nat tide gauges (IOC, 2006). These concern primarily the Global Positioning System \n(GPS) and absolute gravity (AG), or, in the case of the UK, the two techniques used in \ncombination (Teferle et al., 2006). \n \nA main objective of the present investigation is to determine more accurately than before \nthe recent rates of sea level change around the UK coastline. A particularly important \ncomponent of that investigation is a comparison between tide gauge information and data \nfrom geological sources and, in the case of sites with long sea level records, between tide \ngauge and GPS information. A second objective is to understand more about the reasons \nfor interannual and decadal variability in UK sea level. This is an important topic in \n 5\nitself, but it is also relevant in a discussion of long term sea level trends. The degree to \nwhich one is able to model (or understand) the variability determines the accuracy with \nwhich long term trends can be computed, and enters ultimately into a consideration of the \nability for making useful predictions of future sea level. \n \n2. Data Sets \n \nThe UK National Tide Gauge Network is operated by the Proudman Oceanographic \nLaboratory on behalf of the Environment Agency. It consists of 44 sites, almost all of \nwhich nowadays use bubbler pressure gauges as the primary sensors, equipped in many \ncases with half-tide sensors for datum control (Woodworth et al., 1996). A short history \nof recording at each site was provided by Woodworth et al. (1999). \n \nAll UK data are contributed to the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL, \nWoodworth and Player, 2003) and can be inspected and downloaded via \nwww.pol.ac.uk\/psmsl. The Revised Local Reference (RLR) section of that data set \nprovides the monthly and annual MSL values, measured with respect to the same local \nland datum at each station, which are the most suitable for time series analysis. Two RLR \nrecords are available from both Aberdeen and Liverpool, and these were combined into \ncomposite records for each site. In addition, an early section of the Holyhead RLR record \nwas adjusted for the local difference between MSL and Mean Tide Level as described by \nWoodworth et al. (1999). The HadSLP2 monthly mean air pressure data set (Allan and \nAnsell, 2006) was downloaded from the Hadley Centre, UK Met Office \n 6\n(hadobs.metoffice.com\/hadslp2), while best estimates of rates of late Holocene sea level \nchange, represented by the negative of the best estimated values of relative land \nemergence\/submergence, were extracted from Shennan and Horton (2002). \n \n3. Sea Level Trends \n \nTable 1 presents the linear trends in annual MSL in each record for sites with more than \n15 complete years of RLR data, a minimum selection criterion as justified by Woodworth \net al. (1999). Figure 1 shows their locations. The RLR records from Whitby and \nFelixstowe were not included in our selection as the PSMSL documentation made clear \nthat they were of poor quality. Only complete years were considered for the station \nselection criteria, and used for Table 1 for consistency with a similar table in Woodworth \net al. (1999), but in the following tables and figures in this report we have also employed \nannual means computed for years containing only 11 months of data, consistent with \nnormal PSMSL practice. This provides a small increase in the number of station-years \navailable for analysis, at the expense of slightly less precise annual mean values. The gain \ncan be seen by comparing the number of years of data in Tables 1 and 2. \n \nThe five longest records are shown in Figure 2(a), while MSL values for each record are \nshown relative to those at Newlyn in Figure 2(b). The time series in the latter are \ndescribed to a good approximation in terms of a linear trend, consistent with a general \npicture of there being an approximately linear vertical land movement signal in each sea \nlevel record together with coherent variability due to oceanic and meteorological \n 7\nforcings. The five long records provide a reasonably representative sampling of sea level \nchange around the UK coastline. Woodworth et al. (1999) demonstrated that, while the \ncharacter of sea level variability differs between locations, part of this variability is \ncoherent between sites. Consequently, records can justifiably be combined into a UK \u2018sea \nlevel index\u2019 which will be employed below. An index for 1901 onwards, based on the \nfive long records each detrended over a common period 1921-1990, is shown in Figure \n3(a), providing an update to the index presented by Woodworth et al. (1999). Although \nthere are gaps in all records, at least 3 of the 5 stations are represented in the index for all \nyears apart from 1902, 1904 and 1915. \n \nWoodworth et al. (1999) referred to the weak correspondence of the Liverpool time series \nwith the other four records, and this remains the case. Nevertheless, it is one of the \nlongest UK records and cannot be excluded from a UK-average, at the risk of adding \nmore noise than signal to the average. In spite of the simplicity of constructing an index \nin this way, the resulting time series is almost identical to a second index computed using \nprincipal component analysis of both long and short records. The two indices, and their \nregional subsets, provide convincing evidence (Figures 8-11 of Woodworth et al., 1999) \nfor a large part of the MSL variability around the UK coast being coherent. The UK \nindex closely resembles a separate index for the North Sea\/English Channel, based \nprimarily on data from the European coastline (Shennan and Woodworth, 1992) and, as \nwe shall below, it is similar to individual European records from Norway to France. \nConsequently, we have persevered with the use of the readily-updateable simple 5-station \nindex in the present study, confident that it represents a major part of regional coastal \n 8\nMSL variability. The index has a zero long term trend by construction. It contains a small \n\u2018acceleration\u2019 with a quadratic coefficient of 0.0055 \u00b1 0.0028 mm\/year2, comparable to \nthose of the longest records which commence in the mid-19th century (Table 3). It also \ncontains interannual and decadal variability with a root-mean-square (rms) of 24.5 mm. \n \nIn previous analyses of MSL trends, in which comparisons are made to rates of sea level \nchange from nearby geological information, the normal procedure has been to emphasise \nthe importance of the longest records. For example, Douglas (1991), Shennan and \nWoodworth (1992) and Tsimplis and Spencer (1997) determined that typically 50 years \nof data are usually required to derive a standard error on a linear trend of approximately \n0.3 mm\/year, and therefore be useful in studies where the trends themselves are of the \norder of 1-2 mm\/year. (Pirazzoli, 1986 arrived at a similar conclusion from qualitative \ninspection of the records.) Therefore, shorter records have often been discarded or given \na lower weight. However, several authors have used Empirical Orthogonal Function \n(EOF) or \u2018master station\u2019 techniques (e.g. Emery and Aubrey, 1991; Woodworth and \nJarvis, 1991; Savage, 1995; Woodworth et al., 1999), and have shown that shorter records \ncan be used to derive relative sea level trends between stations to good accuracy, taking \nadvantage of the fact that any coherent variability is removed when one station record is \ncompared to another. \n \nTherefore, in the present analysis we have made use of the index itself as the \u2018master\u2019, \nwith a trend computed for a record relative to the index being the best estimate of long \nterm change at a site. We have also made use of MSL values for 1955-2006 provided by \n 9\na tide+surge barotropic numerical model for the NW European continental shelf (Flather \net al., 1998), in an attempt to remove some of the higher-frequency variance from the \nshorter individual records. In the case of such records which commence after 1955, the \nmodel annual MSL values are subtracted from the measured MSLs, and the \ncorresponding model average-MSL for the five stations is subtracted from the index.  \n \nTable 2 presents the linear trends for each station computed by this method, the flag \nindicating whether each record has been compared simply to the index (flag 0) or has \nbeen adjusted by the numerical model (flag 1). The last column shows the correlation \ncoefficient between each MSL record (before any model correction and trend fitting) and \nthe index. The coefficient is seen to be positive for every station. Of course, a positive \ncorrelation is to be expected for the five long records which make up the index. However, \nthe fact that all the others are also positive provides further evidence for part of the \nvariability being similar at each site, and supports the 'master station' approach. The \nremoval of the common variance can be seen to be important. While in some cases there \nis little improvement, in other cases the standard errors are only a fraction of those \nobtained by fitting linear trends to the original records in Table 1. The benefit of using \nthe model (flag 1) was a modest one but it did result in a reduction in residual variance \nabout the fitted trend relative to that in the simple comparison to the index (flag 0) for 10 \nof the 12 records starting in 1955 or later. Therefore, we have chosen to use the flag 1 \nresults for these stations. \n \n 10\nTwo main reservations can be made about the index as employed here. A first is that, as \nreferred to above and as can be seen from Table 2, the similarity between Liverpool and \nthe index of which it is a component is weak. A second is that, due to gaps in each of the \n5 records, the index will have been defined by a different set of stations at different times. \nConsequently, when a short record is considered, there is a varying possibility of its \nnearest neighbour long records being included or not in the index, which could affect the \napparent strength of correlation of the short record with the index. However, these two \nreservations cannot be major ones: the similarity of the 5-station time series with other \nforms of UK and European index means that Liverpool (or bad sections of data in any of \nthe 5 records) cannot result in a significant distortion of it, while the existence of data \nfrom 3 of the 5 stations at all times (apart from 3 early years) means that any localised \ncorrelations between a short record and a long-record neighbour will be diluted by at least \na factor of 3 in the correlation with the index. The complete set of positive correlations, \nof whatever magnitude, in Table 2 provides reassurance of a reasonable (if inevitably \nimperfect) procedure.  \n \nA validation of these findings can be made by comparison of the trends in MSL to those \nobtained from geological information near to the tide gauge stations. Such comparisons \nhave been made before but with the use of the MSL trends as observed in the individual \nrecords (Shennan and Woodworth, 1992; Woodworth et al., 1999; Shennan and Horton, \n2002). Figure 4(a) shows a scatter plot of the MSL trends in Table 1 with the \u2018best \nestimates\u2019 of geological trends by Shennan and Horton (2002) (Table 4). Standard errors \nfor the \u2018best estimates\u2019 are not given by Shennan and Horton (2002), so we have used 0.2 \n 11\nmm\/year throughout for the present study, based on inspection of the tables in their \nreport. \n \nEvidence for correlation between tide gauge and geological data can be seen in Figure 4 \n(a). However, the correlation is at first sight less convincing than in studies of North Sea \nor Scandinavian data (e.g. Shennan and Woodworth, 1992; Milne et al., 2001). The \nreason for this is that the range of possible sea level trends (or vertical land movements) \naround the UK is of the order of only 2 mm\/year, compared to the 4 and 9 mm\/year in the \nNorth Sea and Scandinavia respectively, rather than a generally lower accuracy of UK \ndata. Figure 4 (a) has many similarities to Figure 8 of Shennan and Horton (2002), who \nmade use of the measured MSL trends reported in Woodworth et al. (1999). This would \nsuggest that the addition of a decade of new tide gauge information has resulted in little \nimprovement in agreement between the data sets. However, the correlation is improved in \nFigure 4(b) with the use of the MSL trends from Table 2. Simple correlations between \npoints (ignoring individual errors) of 0.25 and 0.59 are obtained from Figures 4(a) and (b) \nrespectively. This demonstrates that there is a benefit in using the index as a \u2018master \nstation\u2019 in enabling shorter records to be used in analyses of long term change. \n \nIn spite of the apparent improvement in agreement between UK tide gauge and \ngeological data sets, there are some reservations to be made. A first is that Figure 4 (b) \ncontains several outliers with the largest from Rosyth and Immingham. Rosyth was a UK \nHydrographic Office gauge, the generally poorer quality of which was remarked on by \nWoodworth et al. (1999). It is no longer operational. The Immingham tide gauge is \n 12\nknown to be affected by density changes due to runoff from the Humber. In addition, the \nchoice of geological trend to use for comparison depends critically upon location in the \nestuary (Shennan and Horton, 2002). \n \nA second reservation is that the Shennan and Horton (2002) data set does not contain \ngeological estimates for the Hebrides, Shetlands or Northern Ireland. Therefore, MSL \nrecords from Stornoway, Lerwick and Belfast have not been included in the present \nanalysis. With regard to Lerwick, the small amount of geological information available \nfrom the Shetlands and geodynamic models (Hoppe, 1965; Peltier et al., 2002) suggest \nlong term submergence, whereas the tide gauge record (Table 1) suggests significant \nuplift (especially if one considers a present-day sea level rise of approximately 1.4 \nmm\/year, see below). Consequently, it is unlikely that the Lerwick record would conform \nto the encouraging picture of Figure 4 (b), even if copious local geological data were \navailable. Stornoway\u2019s record will be of great interest when longer: its present trend \n(Table 1) appears high although it has a large standard error. Belfast offers the greatest \npotential for further study, with tide gauge charts extending back to the 19th century \nhaving been recently rediscovered in an archive. \n \nThese reservations aside, the consistency evident between tide gauge and geological data \nsets supports the overall picture of spatial variation in vertical land movements in the UK \n(Shennan, 1989; Shennan and Horton, 2004). The distributions of Figures 4 (a,b) also \nindicate that tide gauge MSL trends are in general larger than those inferred from \ngeological data by 1.34 +\/- 0.21 and 1.42 +\/- 0.17 mm\/year respectively (using weighted \n 13\naverages based on the individual tide gauge trend errors, taken as dominating over \ngeological errors, and with standard errors estimated conservatively from both weighted \nand unweighted distributions). The latter value, which we consider the most reliable \nbeing based on the \u2018master station\u2019 method, is approximately 0.3 mm\/year lower than the \naccepted value for global sea level change during the 20th century referred to above \n(Church et al., 2001; Bindoff et al., 2007). \n \nAlthough the shorter records have proved to be useful, there naturally continues to be \nmost interest in the longer ones. Figure 5 (a) presents a scatter plot between the tide \ngauge trends for the 20th century for the 5 long record stations alone (from Table 1) and \ntheir corresponding geological values. One obtains similar conclusions as from Figure 4. \nThe offset is 1.37 +\/- 0.24 mm\/year, similar to that based on all stations. The most \noutlying of the five appears to be Newlyn, either because its tide gauge MSL trend is too \nlow or its geological rate suggests too much submergence. This anomaly in the Shennan \nand Horton (2002) data set has been remarked upon by Gehrels (2006). Figure 5 (b) \nincludes the same MSL data but this time compared to rates of vertical land movement \nbased on an updated combination of continuous GPS (CGPS) and AG data using the \nmethods of Teferle et al. (2006) and Bingley et al. (2007). In this case, the offset is 1.06 \n+\/- 0.16 mm\/year (standard error again based on tide gauge errors. This can be increased \nby 30% if the large CGPS\/AG errors are also considered.). Although uncertainties in the \ncombined CGPS\/AG land rates are large, the two data sets appear to line up better, \nespecially with regard to Newlyn where the value is closer to that of Gehrels (2006) \nrather than Shennan and Horton (2002). This is encouraging but it is clear that the \n 14\nstrength of the evidence for better line-up comes from one station (Aberdeen). \nConsequently, this has to be regarded as a preliminary finding with regard to the use of \nCGPS\/AG data. \n \nOne can adopt 1.4 +\/- 0.2 mm\/year from the offsets of Figures 4(b) and \n5(a) as the best estimate of the rate of climate-related MSL change \nduring the 20th century (in excess of any late-Holocene long term rate). \nThis estimate changes within a range to be expected from a 0.2 mm\/year \nstandard error, if different, but still geographically representative of \nthe UK, selections of tide gauge and geological sites are made (cf. \nFigure 4), or if different CGPS\/AG processing strategies are employed. This value can be \nadded back to the index to provide an average-UK curve since 1901 (Figure 3(b)). One \nfactor that could be responsible for the lower UK MSL trend than the global-average \nIPCC values concerns melting of the Greenland ice sheet during the 20th century. The \nIPCC Third Assessment (Church et al., 2001) considered that Greenland was melting at \nan average rate of between 0.0 and 0.1 mm\/year between 1910-1990 (taking into \nconsideration 20th century effects only). However, this rate has undoubtedly increased in \nrecent years. The IPCC Fourth Assessment (Lemke et al., 2007) suggested that the \nGreenland ice sheet had lost mass at rates equivalent to 0.05 \u00b1 0.12 mm\/year of sea level \nrise during 1961-2003 and 0.21 \u00b1 0.07 mm\/year in 1993-2003. In addition, there are \nsuggestions of an acceleration in the rate (Chen et al., 2006; Rignot and Kanagaratnam, \n2006). The elastic response of the solid Earth will have resulted in a redistribution of sea \nlevel, and thereby a potentially slightly smaller Greenland contribution to UK sea level \n 15\nthan the global-average, depending upon which parts of the ice sheet have lost mass (cf. \nFigure 1(b) of Mitrovica et al., 2001, see also Plag, 2006, Marcos and Tsimplis, 2007 and \nMitrovica et al., 2008). The differences between the UK MSL and geological trends \nincluded in Figure 4(b) have no evident spatial (e.g. latitude) dependence (not shown).  \n \n4. Decadal Variability in the Index \n \nThe success of the use of the index leads to a reconsideration of the reasons for its \ntemporal variability, and thereby for some of the variability in individual UK records. \nThis is an important topic as low-frequency variability affects both the value of a secular \ntrend and its standard error. \n \nFigure 6 presents a low-pass filtered version of the index, after application of a boxcar \nfilter of full width 5 years. The oscillations are approximately coincident with the \n(negative of) those in local air pressure, for which we have selected data from the 55N 0E \ngrid point of HadSLP2 as representative of the UK (HadSLP2 has a 5 degree grid; the \nchoice of adjacent grid points makes little difference to this discussion). The correlation \ncoefficients between the two series are 0.43 and 0.51 for the unsmoothed (i.e. annual \nmean) and smoothed records respectively. For the period after 1930, the correlations \nincrease slightly to 0.47 and 0.61 respectively. Linear regression yields regression \ncoefficients of 9.9 +\/- 2.1 and 15.3 +\/- 2.6 mm\/mbar respectively, suggesting larger \ndepartures from the \u2018inverse barometer\u2019 (IB) at lower frequencies, as observed at many \nlocations in the UK, Europe and elsewhere (e.g. Pugh and Thompson, 1986; Mathers and \n 16\nWoodworth, 2001). The departures will arise from forcings (e.g. winds, steric changes \nand runoff) coherent to some extent with air pressure changes. However, Figure 6 \ndemonstrates that there is variability in the index which is not coincident with that in air \npressure (resulting in correlation coefficients less than 1), and yet takes place within a \nshort time of the pressure changes and\/or with a variable amplitude. Following Miller and \nDouglas (2007), one can compute a ratio of the rms values of the index and air pressure \nsmoothed time series, as an indicator of the non-IB, and yet pressure-related, variability \nin the index. (The pressure-relations would include barotropic wind forcing, and the \nocean adjustment to the air pressure and wind forcings over several years.) This yields a \nratio of 30.2 mm\/mbar, or approximately 3 times the magnitude of the IB response. \n \nA similar conclusion was obtained for 1955 onwards by comparing the index to MSL \nfrom the numerical tide+surge model averaged over the 5 station locations: correlation \ncoefficients of 0.50 and 0.45 respectively were obtained, and a ratio of 3.6 for sea level \nvariability in the smoothed time series of the index compared to that in the model. This \nfollows from the fact that the model average sea level will be something like the regional \nIB response, the modelled sea level changes due to winds over the shelf being more \nspatially variable (cf. discussion of correlations between modelled MSL values at \ndifferent ports in section 3.6 of Woodworth et al., 1999). A similar finding was also \nobtained with the use of a 1\u00b0 global barotropic model forced by six-hourly European \nCentre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) air pressures and winds for the \nshorter period 1985-2004 (Hughes and Stepanov, 2004; Stepanov and Hughes 2004). In \nthis case, UK-average model sea level was defined by the average of the Newlyn and \n 17\nAberdeen information, Liverpool and Sheerness not being well represented in the model \ngrid and North Shields excluded so as not to over-weight the average with North Sea \nvalues. Correlation coefficients of 0.41 and 0.61 respectively were obtained, and a ratio \nof 2.4 for variability in the smoothed time series of the index compared to that of the \nmodel. \n \nSimilar findings for MSL variability were obtained for Brest, France by Miller and \nDouglas (2007). They obtained a ratio between the low-pass filtered variability of sea \nlevel and local air pressure of 36 mm\/mbar but an explanation for the non-IB response in \nterms of possible forcings was not immediately apparent. (The UK index is too short to \nallow a comparison of British sea level with distant (i.e. Azores) air pressures on \ntimescales of more than a century, as Miller and Douglas (2007) performed for Brest and \nCascais, Portugal. At decadal timescales at least there is no such relationship.) Therefore, \nthe non-IB character of much of the variability observed in the index extends beyond the \nUK. \n \nA large number of authors have tried to understand the various oceanographic and \nmeteorological forcings responsible for low-frequency UK and European Atlantic coast \nMSL variability (e.g. Rossiter, 1962; Thompson, 1986). These include steric (density) \nchanges, ocean circulation variability, winds and air pressures (Pugh, 2004). A number \nhave attempted to relate the variability of European MSL to the large scale air pressure \nfield represented by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (e.g. Wakelin et al., 2003; \nWoolf et al., 2003; Tsimplis et al., 2005; Tsimplis et al., 2006; Miller and Douglas, 2007; \n 18\nKolker and Hameed, 2007). However, to our knowledge, such studies have not provided \nevidence for coherent UK or European-coastline variability such as we require. A \ncomplicating factor is that the time series of many meteorological forcing terms are \nhighly correlated. For example, river runoff is known to be responsible for MSL \nvariability in many parts of the world on seasonal and longer timescales (e.g. Meade and \nEmery, 1971; Tsimplis and Woodworth, 1994; Wang et al., 1997; Huenicke and Zorita, \n2006), and is a contributor to density change on the NW European continental shelf (Reid \net al., 1988). Therefore, one might expect runoff (or its proxy in rainfall) to be a potential \nforcing of UK MSL also, although it might be less plausible for relatively open-ocean \nsites such as Newlyn than it would be for sites in river estuaries such as Sheerness. \nRainfall and air pressure changes in the UK are highly correlated on interannual \ntimescales (Woodworth, 1985). Consequently, it is not surprising that a UK rain time \nseries computed from spatially-averaged normalized variability for 1914-2005 obtained \nfrom the UK Met Office (www.metoffice.gov.uk\/research\/hadleycentre\/obsdata\/ukcip\/, \nsee Perry and Hollis, 2005 for details of rainfall data set construction) yields positive \ncorrelation coefficients with the sea level index (0.41 and 0.54 for unsmoothed and \nsmoothed records respectively). However, a positive correlation does not confirm runoff \n(or any other shelf parameter) as a significant forcing factor for MSL. The best approach \nwith regard to the role of runoff will be through advanced numerical modelling of shelf \nprocesses which are just beginning (e.g. Young and Holt, 2007). \n \nNevertheless, one probably has to search for processes with larger spatial scales than the \nshelf, given that the decadal variability in the UK index has similarities to that in many \n 19\nother records along the European Atlantic coastline (Thompson, 1980; Woodworth, \n1987). Figure 7 shows some of the longer European records, together with the UK index, \neach detrended over the period 1921-1990 and low-pass filtered as above. The coherent \nvariability between most of them is evident, correlation coefficients between the UK \nindex and other stations being (north to south): 0.56, 0.33, 0.61, 0.29 (or 0.69 for data \nfrom 1915), 0.05 and 0.53. (A coefficient of 0.28 would be considered significant at 95% \nconfidence level given 50 years of data assuming no serial corelation.) Even the one with \nno apparent correlation (La Coru\u00f1a) does have similarities to the UK index for parts of its \nrecords (cf. Thompson, 1980; the La Coru\u00f1a record is discussed in detail by Marcos et \nal., 2005). \n \nThompson (1986) described a simple model of change in zonal (trans-Atlantic) sea level \ngradient, such that sea level on the European coast would be proportional to the integral \nof [distance times Ekman pumping], with distance measured eastwards from the western \nboundary. The distance term gives greater weight to Ekman pumping on the eastern \nboundary, which again implies an approximate relationship to (the negative of) local air \npressure, and gives another example of correlated variables. Thompson (1986) explained \nthat this process contributes to a greater extent at lower frequencies and is capable of \nsimulating part of the drop in Newlyn MSL during the 1970s (Figure 10 of Thompson, \n1986). \n \nSuch physics is nowadays included in ocean and climate models. For example, Hill et al. \n(2007) employed the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) 1\u00b0 resolution general \n 20\ncirculation model (Marshall et al., 1997), which includes daily oceanic heat and \nfreshwater fluxes as well as meteorological forcings, to study MSL variability at tide \ngauge sites worldwide over the period 1958-1997. The model time series for Newlyn is \nshown in Figure 8, demonstrating the drop in the 1970s and, owing partly to the IB \nresponse, a drop in the early 1990s. Correlation coefficients with the index are 0.64 and \n0.63 for unsmoothed and smoothed records respectively, with a ratio of 1.1 for variability \nin the smoothed time series of the index compared to that of the model. Although it is not \npossible at present to extend the modelling through the whole period of the index, it \nconfirms that ocean circulation change is probably the main source of its low-frequency \nvariability, and that ocean modelling offers the best possibility for its further \nunderstanding. \n \nWhatever the reasons for variability in the index in Figure 3(a), it is intriguing that it \ncontains several features in common with sea level records from elsewhere in the world. \nThese include a reduction in the rate of sea level change, or deceleration, after 1960 (e.g. \nWoodworth et al., 2008; Douglas, 2008). During the 1990s, many locations experienced \nhigh rates of sea level change (Holgate and Woodworth, 2004), and this can be seen to \nhave been the case also around the UK coastline. \n \n5. Conclusions \n \nThis report has summarized current knowledge of change in MSL around the UK \ncoastline. It has made use of a larger number of shorter sea level records than has been \n 21\nemployed so far, in order to maximize the amount of available information, and has been \nbased on an improved method for determination of UK sea level trends. The changes \nobserved are consistent with findings of previous analyses, although they are more \nprecise. They suggest a pattern of UK coastal sea level change composed of spatially-\nvariable (primarily north-south) local vertical land movements, which can be inferred \nfrom either geological (e.g. Shennan and Horton, 2004) or geodetic data (e.g. Teferle et \nal., 2006) together with geodynamic modelling (Milne et al., 2006), superimposed upon \nwhich are sea level variations due to changes in the ocean, with a large part of that \nvariability being spatially-coherent. This overall picture is inevitably an approximate one, \nbut it is gratifying that the consistency in interpretation of the different data sets (tide \ngauge, geological, geodetic) appears to have risen as their temporal and spatial coverage \nhas increased. The comparison of tide gauge, geological and geodetic trends provides an \nestimate of 1.4 +\/-0.2 mm\/year for the climate-related secular change in UK MSL since \n1901 (in excess of any late-Holocene long term rate).  \n \nSome progress has also been made in understanding the reasons for variability of UK \nMSL on interannual and decadal timescales. An inability to account adequately for \ndecadal variability results in greater uncertainty in the calculation of long term sea level \ntrends. It is also a topic of interest in its own right. It has been demonstrated that much of \nit is related to air pressure change. However, it is not a simple relationship such as that \nimplied by the local IB model or even by the shelf response to air pressures and winds. \nOne finds a UK-average response to air pressure approximately three times that of the IB \nmodel. The large scale air pressure and wind fields (e.g. as represented by the NAO) \n 22\nundoubtedly play a role in producing this response, as must the ocean circulation \nadjustment to those forcings. The modelling of four decades of ocean circulation change \nby Hill et al. (2007) has indicated the most encouraging direction for such work. It would \nbe highly desirable for the ocean modelling to be taken further back to the start of the 20th \ncentury should the required data sets of model forcing become available. In addition, \nmore local contributors to MSL variability such as runoff cannot as yet be excluded, and \nrequire study from runs of advanced shelf models (e.g. Young and Holt, 2007). \n \nThe validity of the simple model of a regionally-coherent sea level signal of ocean origin \nsuperimposed on a spatial pattern of local vertical land movement is important, in that it \nprovides the most straightforward means for developing scenarios of future sea level \nchange around the UK and their possible impacts (cf. Hulme et al., 2002; Tsimplis et al., \n2005). Projections for 21st century UK sea level change have in most studies been \nassumed to be similar to the global projections, and will necessarily remain so until fuller \nunderstanding of regional deviations from global-averages is obtained from improved \natmosphere-ocean general circulation models. Therefore, given that global projections in \nthe two recent IPCC Assessments are similar, if Fourth Assessment values are increased \nto allow for the dynamic response of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to warming \n(Church et al., 2008), then conclusions on future change in sea level around the UK, such \nas those for the 2080s by the UK Climate Impacts Programme (Hulme et al., 2002: \ntypically several 10s of cm in low emission scenarios, typically 75 cm in a high emission \nscenario) would be essentially unchanged.  \n \n 23\nAcknowledgements \n \nWe thank Emma Hill, Rui Ponte, Jim Davis and Detlef Stammer for the MIT model data \nset, Jane Williams for help with the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory (POL) \ntide+surge model data, and Vladimir Stepanov for the POL global barotropic model \ninformation.

The Aberdeen and Liverpool time series are \ncomposites as described by Woodworth et al. (1999). The North Shields, Sheerness and \nNewlyn records are from the PSMSL RLR data set. Each record has been offset for \npresentation purposes. (b) MSL values for the records of (a) relative to MSL at Newlyn, \nCornwall. \n \n3. (a) A UK sea level index for the period 1901 onwards computed from MSL data from \nfive stations (Aberdeen, North Shields, Sheerness, Newlyn and Liverpool). Each record \nhas been detrended over the period 1921-1990 and the detrended values averaged. \nStandard deviations of detrended values about the average are shown by the error bars. \n(b) As for (a) but with a best estimate of 1.4 mm\/year added back to the index to provide \nan average UK time series for climate-related MSL change. \n \n4. (a) Measured trends in MSL for 1901 onwards for the stations in Table 1 compared \nwith the (negative of) emergence\/submergence rate obtained from nearby geological \ninformation (Shennan and Horton, 2002). (b) Trends in MSL derived by the \u2018master \n 37\nstation\u2019 method (Table 2) compared to the same geological information. The solid, \ndashed and dotted lines indicate offsets between data sets of zero and \u00b11 mm\/year. \nUncertainties shown by the vertical error bars in (a) and (b) are the standard errors of \ncomputed trends in MSL given in Tables 1 and 2 respectively. Uncertainties shown by \nthe horizontal error bars are the 0.2 mm\/year nominal errors for geological \u2018best \nestimates\u2019 described in the text. \n \n5. (a) Measured trends in MSL for 1901 onwards for the 5 longest records compared to \ngeological information. (b) Measured trends in MSL compared to the corresponding \ninformation from GPS and AG. (N: Newlyn, S: Sheerness, L: Liverpool, NS: North \nShields, A: Aberdeen.) The solid, dashed and dotted lines indicate offsets between data \nsets of zero and \u00b11 mm\/year. Uncertainties shown by the vertical error bars in both (a) \nand (b) are the standard errors of computed trends in MSL given in Table 1. Uncertainties \nshown by the horizontal error bars in (a) are the 0.2 mm\/year nominal errors for \ngeological \u2018best estimates\u2019 described in the text. Those in (b) are the standard errors from \nCGPS and AG measurements in combination. \n \n \n6. A low-pass filtered version of the sea level index compared with (the negative of) \nrepresentative UK air pressure. The air pressure time series has been scaled to have the \nsame root-mean-square variability as the index. \n \n 38\n7. Selected MSL records from the European coastline (Stavanger, Norway; Esbjerg, \nDenmark; Ostende, Belgium; Brest, France; La Coru\u00f1a, Spain; Cascais, Portugal) \ntogether with the UK index. Each record has been detrended over the period 1921-1990, \nlow-pass filtered with a 5 year boxcar filter, and offset for presentation purposes. \n \n8. MSL changes at Newlyn from the ocean model study of Hill et al. (2007). The solid \nline shows the overall contribution from both ocean circulation and IB, while the dashed \nline shows the ocean circulation contribution only.
