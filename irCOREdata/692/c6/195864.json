They can provide \nnot only learning resources such as reading materials, handouts and powerpoint slides \nfrom lectures, but also a discussion forum where students can talk to each other on-line, \nor post questions for the course tutor to answer. There are several benefits of an \nasynchronous discussion, for example the convenience of when and from where to \nreply, increased student support, and time to think about the material being discussed \n(for a list of studies and a summary of the benefits see the paper by Palmer, Holt, & \nBray, 2008). VLEs are a rapidly developing area in education, and research has already \nindicated that they provide a valuable resource for learners (Roulston & Clarke, 2003).  \n \nStudents seem happy to engage with on-line resources and research by Peat and \nFranklin (2002), with undergraduate biology students, showed that students engaged \nwith both the on-line learning materials and the formative assessment opportunities, \nand that their learning was encouraged as a result. Recent research with nursing \nstudents undertaking a human anatomy and physiology module, found that although \nstudents generally found the VLE system easy to use, the frequency with which they \nused it did not correlate strongly with the final examination mark achieved (Green et \nal., 2006). Green et al. did, however, conclude that the VLE and the associated \navailable resources were useful in supporting student learning.  \n \nIn the medical education domain, de Leng, Dolmans, Muijtjens, and Van der Vleuten \n(2006) found that medical students perceived that the VLE supported face-to-face \ninteraction in the discussion phase of a problem-based learning task, and that hyperlinks \nencouraged further reading of the materials. Jones, Cramton, Gauvin and Scott (1998), \nhave similarly shown that VLEs can help students to work in teams that are \ngeographically dispersed, and to understand virtual team working, which they argue \nwill be essential in future years as commerce and education becomes increasingly \nvirtual. \n \nRather than examining the impact that on-line text-based materials have on learning, \nthe research reported in this article examines how VLE discussion boards can be used \nto clarify issues for students by discussions with their tutor on-line, and whether this \nuse impacts on their grades. Students using Blackboard (a VLE) can ask questions on-\nline about the assignments that they are working on. These questions and answers are \nvisible for all students on the module to see, thus reducing the number of questions that \nthe tutor has to answer individually. It also provides the students with answers to \nquestions that they would never have thought to ask on their own. Thus, through \ninteracting with the discussion board, students have the opportunity to ask well thought \nout questions that they may not want to ask in a face-to-face situation with a tutor or in \na seminar. The relative anonymity of the VLE, which can be totally anonymous if \nrequired, can provide a safe place for students to ask questions that they may be too shy \nto ask in person, especially if they perceive it to be a \u2018stupid\u2019 question. We hypothesise \nthat using the VLE discussion board could lead to a better understanding of the material \nbeing studied and thus higher grades, and we aim to demonstrate empirically if this is \nthe case.  \n \nThere is some existing research on the impact of on-line discussions on students\u2019 \ngrades. For example, Palmer, Holt and Bray (2008) studied engineering undergraduates \nVLE Advice and Grades    3 \nand concluded that the number of postings made to an on-line discussion had a \nsignificant positive impact on the students\u2019 final module grades. The number of \npostings read, however, did not influence grades, indicating that just \u2018lurking\u2019 was not \nenough to improve the work handed in. They concluded that it was the work done in \npreparing the postings that had lead to higher grades. Other research has shown similar \nfindings, for example Davies and Graff (2005) found that business students who \nachieved higher grades were more active users of the discussion board. Similarly, \nWebb, Jones, Barker, and van Schaik, (2004) found evidence that posting questions \nimproved grades, but in contrast they showed that passive participation (just reading \nand not posting) also had a positive impact on grades. \n \nThe obvious problem with such studies is that they are essentially correlational; \nexamining relationships between VLE behaviour and grades. Determining causality is \nthe problem in correlational studies. Thus, in order to remove the possible confounding \neffect of more motivated or higher achieving students using the VLE more often, a \nrepeated-measures design will be employed in our study so that participants act as their \nown controls. By comparing students\u2019 grades after the introduction of a VLE discussion \nboard with their grades on a similar assignment before it was available, we will be able \nto see clearly whether the use of the VLE discussion board to ask questions of the tutor \nand discuss issues with other students has had an impact on grades. The impact of \npassive reading and active posting will also be examined. The previous literature leads \nus to predict that both passive reading and active posting should increase grades.  \n \nMethod \nParticipants \nA class of 177 first year undergraduate psychology students, studying a statistics and \nresearch methods module, were offered the opportunity to join into a discussion board \non a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) (Blackboard, Release 6, on Windows 2003). \nEight students did not submit the second assignment and three did not submit the first \nassignment, and thus were not included in the analyses, as there were no grades \navailable. The analyses are based on the data from 166 participants (mean age = 19.16 \nyears, SD = 1.99, 27 men and 139 women). \n \nDesign and procedure \nA repeated measures quasi-experimental design was employed. Students\u2019 grades on the \nassignment (where Blackboard discussion was available) and on their previous \nassignment (where no Blackboard discussion was on offer) were recorded, as the \ndependent variables, thus participants served as their own control group. The number of \nquestions each student asked on the discussion board, and how many questions and \nanswers they read on it, were recorded using the Statistics tool to produce day-by-day \ndata. We make the assumption that when a student accessed a message that they read it; \nwe have no proof that they read the message, but since most messages were fairly short \nit seems a reasonable assumption that they read all of it. The assignments were \nstructured lab reports, reporting relevant literature and analysing data using SPSS. The \nfirst investigated Locus of Control and stress using correlation analyses, while the \nsecond investigated liking and familiarity with repeated-measures t-tests. The module \nwas a series of six two-hour lectures and four one-hour lab classes. The tutor was \nunknown to the students before the module began. The students had not used \nBlackboard before so were shown in a lecture how to use it and encouraged to take part \nin the discussion board to ask questions about the statistics being used and the topic of \nVLE Advice and Grades    4 \nthe assignment. The questions and answers on Blackboard revolved around specifics of \nthe second assignment, to develop a better understanding of the subject. At the time \nwhen Blackboard was not available, the students had access to the department\u2019s \u2018Help \nDesk\u2019 facility, where they could ask questions face-to-face with the demonstrators who \nhad taught the lab class. Students were unaware that their use of Blackboard would be \nstudied in relation to their grades for this study, in case it influenced their behaviour. \nEthical approval was granted for the researchers to access the grades and data on \nBlackboard usage. The researchers explained about the study and debriefed the students \nin a lecture. Students were informed that their data would only be reported on a group \nbasis, was confidential, and would be anonymized after collation, but that if they \nwished to they could withdraw their data from the study. Since all coursework and \nexams are marked anonymously students would not have feared any repercussions of \nwithdrawing. In the event no one withdrew. \n \nTo ensure that any observed changes in grades were only due to the discussion forum, \nno other on\u2013line materials were made available through Blackboard for the assignment \n(this also ensured that the Statistics tool was only reporting discussion board activity). \nStudents posted questions about their assignment over the course of two weeks leading \nup to the deadline. There was no limit on the number of questions that they could ask, \nand they were not required to post questions. Postings to the board could be anonymous \nor not, but most students chose to be anonymous. Thirty two questions were asked and \nsubsequently answered, mostly by the course tutor, giving around 60 posts\/messages \nthat could be read. The assignments were blind marked by markers who had not taken \npart in the Blackboard discussion, and were not marked by the tutor who had answered \nquestions on Blackboard. The markers did not know who had taken part in the \ndiscussion and who had not. \n \nResults \nOver the two weeks there were 2938 hits on the message board. Thirty eight people \nchose not to use the discussion board at all, but 128 students did use it. Excluding the \n38 people who never logged on, the average number of messages read was 23 (SD = \n27.17), the median was 13 and the mode was 6. The number of messages read ranged \nfrom 0 to 129, as some people obviously re-read messages that they had already \naccessed.  \n \nParticipants were categorised into 4 groups, via a quartile split, according to how many \nposts they read when Blackboard was available, with the resulting categories being: No \nUse (0\u20131 posts read, n = 46), Low Use (2\u20137 posts read, n = 40), Medium Use (8\u201322 \nposts read, n = 39), and High Use (23+ posts read, n = 41). We classed people who read \none post as not having used Blackboard as they did not read both a question and an \nanswer. A 2 X 4 ANOVA, with the 4 levels of reading Blackboard (between-subjects) \nand 2 levels of Blackboard (available\/unavailable, within-subjects), was performed to \nassess their impact on the coursework grades. The grades on the assignment with \nBlackboard discussion available were significantly higher (M = 57.89%, SD = 7.77) \nthan those on the previous assignment when it was unavailable (M = 56.25%, SD = \n6.85), F(1, 162) = 7.729, p =  .006, \u03b7p2 = .05. This could generally be due to students \nimproving their statistical and report writing skills across the module, or could indicate \nthat the VLE discussion did have an impact on learning and subsequent grades. The \nway to unravel this is to examine the impact of the VLE usage on the same students \nacross time, via the interaction, which can be seen in Figure 1. \nVLE Advice and Grades    5 \n \nFigure 1: Average grades for assignments when students had access to a VLE \ndiscussion board and when they did not, split by how many posts they read on the VLE \nwhen it was available \n \nThe significant interaction in Figure 1 clearly shows that for the second assignment, \nwhen the Blackboard discussion forum was available, students who read more of the \nBlackboard posts achieved higher grades than those students who read less, but those \nsame students did not achieve higher grades in the first assignment, F(3, 162) = 2.76, p \n= .04, \u03b7p2 = .05. Examining the assignment grades when Blackboard was available, \nusing a one-way ANOVA, shows that significantly higher grades were achieved by the \nstudents who had read more than 23 discussion board posts (High usage) (M = 61.20, \nSD = 8.06), and those who read 8\u201322 (Medium usage) (M = 59.15, SD = 6.02), than \nthose who read none (M = 54.50, SD = 7.43), F(3, 162) = 6.43, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .11. \nThose students who had low usage (2\u20137 reads) did not differ significantly from the \nother groups\u2019 grades (M = 57.18, SD = 7.89). \n \nThe grades achieved when Blackboard was unavailable did not significantly differ \nbetween the students who later went on have High Blackboard usage (n = 41, M = \n57.12, SD = 7.03), Medium usage (n = 39, M = 56.51, SD = 5.98), Low usage (n = 40, \nM = 56.97, SD = 7.48), or no usage (n = 46, M = 54.63, SD = 6.76), F(3, 162) = 1.25, p \n= .29. This tends to support the argument that it was not only the most academically \ncapable students who chose to use Blackboard, and who would thus have obtained \nhigher grades anyway. \n \nLooking at the two groups of students who improved their grades via the Blackboard \ndiscussion, the Medium group (8\u201322 reads) improved their assignment grades by an \naverage of 2.64%, t(38) = 2.28, p =.03, d = 0.37, while the students who read the most \n(23+ reads) improved their grades by 4.07%, t(40) = 2.84, p = .007, d = 0.44. Those \n50.0\n52.0\n54.0\n56.0\n58.0\n60.0\n62.0\n0-1 reads 2-7 reads 8-22 reads 23+ reads\nVLE Discussion Board Usage (when available)\nM\nea\nn \ngr\nad\ne \n%\nAssignment 1 (no VLE)\nAssignment 2 (with VLE)\nVLE Advice and Grades    6 \nwho did not use Blackboard did not improve their grades at all (-0.13%). This is clear \nevidence for the efficacy of the discussion board on grades. The higher grades when \nBlackboard was available, achieved by the High and Medium usage groups was not \nmirrored by them having higher grades when it was unavailable. \n \nThe previous analyses show that using the Blackboard discussion forum made an \nimpact on grades, but did just reading the posts have an impact, or was asking questions \nnecessary for improved grades? In terms of Blackboard usage, one student asked four \nquestions, five people asked two questions, and 18 asked one question. Examining only \nthe people who used Blackboard (when it was available), a 2 X 2 ANOVA [asked a \nquestion\/didn\u2019t ask a question (between-subjects) X Blackboard available\/unavailable, \n(within-subjects)], showed that there was no significant interaction effect on grades (see \nFigure 2), F(1, 118) = 2.43, p = .12. There was no significant difference between the \ntwo groups in how much they improved. Students who asked one or more questions \nraised their grades significantly by 4.62%, from M = 57.21 (SD = 6.39) to M = 61.83 \n(SD = 8.24), t(23) = 2.73, p = .012, d = 0.56.  The \u2018lurkers\u2019, however, who didn\u2019t ask \nquestions but did read them, also significantly raised their grades, from M = 56.79 (SD \n= 6.95) to M = 58.53 (SD = 7.23), t(95) = 2.11, p = .037, d = 0.22, a rise of 1.74%.  \n \n \n \nFigure 2: Average grades for assignments when students had access to a VLE \ndiscussion board and when they did not, split by whether they asked questions on the \nVLE when it was available \n \nDiscussion \nThe students used the discussion board a lot, but tended to read more than they wrote \n(as only 32 questions were asked, but nearly 3000 reading hits were recorded). Of \ncourse once the commonest questions, that many people shared, had been answered \n50.0\n52.0\n54.0\n56.0\n58.0\n60.0\n62.0\n64.0\nDidn't ask a question Asked 1 or more\nquestions\nDidn't use Blackboard\nAsking Questions on the VLE Discussion Board (when available)\nM\nea\nn \ngr\nad\ne \n%\nAssignment 1 (no VLE)\nAssignment 2 (with VLE)\nVLE Advice and Grades    7 \nthen there was no need for subsequent people to ask them, only for them to read the \nanswers. Figure 1 shows that the students who read the discussion board the most \nimproved their grades the most. Previous research showed positive correlations \nbetween the number of messages read and grades achieved but causality cannot be \ndetermined by correlations; it could have been the case that students who were more \nacademically capable and motivated read more of the messages but that they would \nhave achieved higher grades anyway, even without the discussion board. The research \nin this paper controls for this problem to a large extent and it seems most plausible that \nthe increase in grades is attributable to the Blackboard discussion and not down to \nmotivational factors or the Hawthorne effect (as the students did not know they were \nbeing studied). It is possible that the more capable and motivated students did \nparticipate more in the discussion board, perhaps making up the High Usage group, but \nany extra motivation or ability that they possessed was not sufficient to have \nsignificantly raised their grades above the other students in the previous assignment, \nand thus arguably indicates that they would not have got the higher grades, that they did \nachieve in the second assignment, if the Blackboard discussion had not been available.  \n \nIt seems, therefore, that the students were either learning from the messages or being \nguided by them, and that the more they read the better their assignments became, as \nthey incorporated ideas and advice into them and their understanding increased. The \nincrease in the marks is probably the result of communicating with the tutor, who was \nthe one giving most of the advice. Admittedly, in this study the most motivated students \nmay have reaped the most benefit from the discussion board, but that does not mean \nthat other students could not benefit if they were encouraged or forced to take part in \nsuch an on-line discussion as part of their coursework. \n \nFigure 2 shows that higher grades were achieved by students who asked questions in \nthe Blackboard forum, and it seems likely that the students who asked questions were \nthe ones who were most engaged with the assignment and who had thought most \ndeeply about the details. Indeed, the student who asked the most questions was one of \nonly two students who achieved the highest grade of 80%. The lurkers also achieved \nhigher grades too, showing that having insightful questions asked of the tutor in an \nopen discussion was clearly helpful to the students who hadn\u2019t asked questions. \n \nIn this study, unlike Palmer, Holt and Bray\u2019s (2001), we found that passive lurking did \nimprove grades. There are differences between the two studies, for example Palmer, \nHolt and Bray\u2019s students were assessed on their postings whereas ours were not, and in \nours the tutor provided much of the information, rather than students discussing issues \nwith other students. In practice the students in our study mostly asked questions of the \ntutor, although if the tutor was delayed in answering then often other students would \noffer an answer (the tutor could add corrective comments later, if the students had \nmisled each other). Perhaps lurkers in our study took more note of the discussion \ninformation because the tutor was seen as an authority figure. It would be interesting \nfor future researchers to see if similar grade increases are apparent when the same \nadvice is given by someone identified as the tutor and someone not identified as a tutor. \nIn practice some psychology departments ask demonstrators (often postgraduate \nstudents) to answer Blackboard questions for practical assignments, and their \neffectiveness at raising grades should be evaluated. Do the students weight advice \ndifferently according to the perceived source? \n \nVLE Advice and Grades    8 \nA limitation of this study is that it is a quasi-experimental design, as the presence or \nabsence of Blackboard was manipulated but there was no random assignment to the \nconditions of how many messages were read or posted. That is, students decided for \nthemselves whether to join the Blackboard discussion or not, and how much they used \nit, rather than being randomly allocated to take part, or not. This self-assignment of the \nparticipants to one of the four groups, rather than assignment by the experimenter, \nmakes the causal nature of the results less certain, and this should be borne in mind \nwhen interpreting them. Although the results are persuasive they are not absolutely \nconclusive, but rival explanations for the observed data are weak in our opinion. The \nrepeated-measures design enables us to see that the students\u2019 grades were not \nsignificantly different on the first assignment when there was no Blackboard, but on the \nsecond assignment significant increases in grades correspond to increased use of the \nBlackboard discussion board. What seems obvious from Figure 1 is that those students \nwho chose not to join the discussion board maintained the same grades as before, while \nthose who did join learned and improved their grades quite substantially.  \n \nThe discussion board was reportedly popular among the students and they continued to \nuse it for the assignments following the ones reported here, with more students logging \non, more questions asked and more reading of messages. To enhance the already \ncompleted research, future researchers may want to interview students about their \nperceptions of VLEs, or perhaps examine the content of the messages in depth. Future \nresearch should also investigate why grades improved; did the students take a strategic \napproach to improve their grades, or was the discussion board keeping them engaged \nwith the report - revising their work and thinking more deeply as messages were posted \nover many days? The nature of the material in the module studied (statistics and report \nwriting), did not lend itself to in-depth discussions between the students, and the \ndiscussion was more of a question and answer session with the tutor. Thus this paper \ncannot claim to generalise its findings to modules where the discussions are more \ninteractive and students\u2019 opinions can be expressed and debated much more fully. \nHaving the Blackboard discussion forum does seem to have been an asset to the \nstudents on this module. It also enabled the tutor to answer lots of questions fully and in \none place for the benefit of all students, rather than answering many separate repetitious \nemails from students, which had been the case in previous years.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe author would like to thank the University of Leicester for granting study leave to \nwrite this article and to Professor David Hawkridge for helpful feedback on a draft of \nthis manuscript. \n \nVLE Advice and Grades    9 \nReferences \nDavies, J. & Graff, M.
