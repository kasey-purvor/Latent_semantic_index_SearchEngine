Introduction\n[2] In this paper we seek to map the rate at which snow\naccumulates on the Antarctic ice sheet and also to quantify\nthe accuracy of our map as objectively as possible. Better\nmaps of snow accumulation are needed to understand and\npredict ongoing changes in the size of the Antarctic ice\nsheet [Wingham et al., 1998; Rignot and Thomas, 2002].\nThese changes are important in driving global sea level\n[Church et al., 2001]. A better understanding of errors is\nneeded to optimize predictions of the future behavior of the\nice sheet using data assimilation methods analogous to those\nused for weather prediction [Arthern and Hindmarsh,\n2003].\n[3] In a given year an ice sheet may grow or shrink.\nGrowth occurs when the accumulation of snow outweighs\nthe loss of ice from the margins. The three most important\nmeasurements for understanding and predicting changes in\nthe size of the ice sheet are (1) the accumulation of snow\nupon the ice-sheet, (2) the ice-export from the margins by\nicebergs and melt, and (3) mass changes derived from\nrepeated surveys of thickness or gravity. Mass changes\nand ice-export have been estimated for many regions of\nAntarctica, accurate to about 10% of the ice-flux [Wingham\net al., 1998; Rignot and Thomas, 2002; Joughin and\nTulaczyk, 2002]. The snow accumulation, and its likely\nerror, are not known so precisely. This limits our knowledge\nof the mass changes occurring in Antarctica, and our ability\nto predict them [Rignot and Thomas, 2002; Vaughan et al.,\n1999]. For that reason, we concentrate here upon estimating\nthe accumulation rate, together with its uncertainty.\n[4] Recent maps of accumulation rate have been derived\nfrom compilations of data collected in situ from snowpits,\nsnow-stakes, or ice cores, sometimes augmented by satellite\nobservations [Vaughan et al., 1999; Giovinetto and Zwally,\n2000; Huybrechts et al., 2000]. Accumulation rates are\nessentially equivalent to the meteorological \u2018\u2018surface mass\nbalance,\u2019\u2019 i.e., the net mass flux from atmosphere to ice, and\nthey have also been derived from numerical atmospheric\nmodels [Genthon and Krinner, 2001; van Lipzig et al.,\n2002]. The accuracy of all of these maps has usually been\nassessed simply by comparing one map with another.\n[5] A problem occurs when the data or methods used to\nproduce the maps are shared to some degree, since the maps\nmay then share common errors that are not revealed by\ndifferencing. Recent surveys by Vaughan et al. [1999],\nGiovinetto and Zwally [2000], and Huybrechts et al.\n[2000] have much in situ data in common, so comparing\nthese maps reveals little about their errors. Numerical\nmodels may also share biases [Genthon and Krinner,\n2001]. Comparison of model output with compilations of\nthe in situ data reveals discrepancies greater than 50% in\nplaces [Genthon and Krinner, 2001].\n[6] In short, errors in accumulation maps are poorly\nconstrained and may be as large as 50% in places. The\ndistance over which errors covary is equally uncertain.\nConsequently, when the maps are averaged spatially over\nsome region of the ice sheet, the likely error cannot be\nquantified with any great precision. Uncertainty over the\nprecision of current maps limits their use for forecasting\nhow Antarctica will contribute to global sea level during the\ncoming century. Here, we seek to combine in situ data with\nsatellite observations in a geostatistical framework that\nprovides a more objective assessment of uncertainties.\n[7] At present there is no direct way of monitoring the\narrival of snow at any site on the ice sheet from space, but\nsatellites can provide spatial information helpful to the\ninterpolation of in situ data. Thermal microwaves are\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 111, D06107, doi:10.1029\/2004JD005667, 2006\n1British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\n2Applied Physics Laboratory, University of Washington, Seattle,\nWashington, USA.\nCopyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/06\/2004JD005667\nD06107 1 of 10\nemitted from the uppermost tens of meters of the snow-\ncover (in which we include \u2018\u2018firn,\u2019\u2019 older yet unconsolidated\nsnow). As such they contain information about its properties\n[Zwally and Giovinetto, 1995]. Vaughan et al. [1999] report\non the interpolation of an extensive compilation of in situ\nobservations. They used the sensitivity of microwave emis-\nsion to accumulation rate (following Zwally and Giovinetto\n[1995]) to guide this interpolation in regions where no in\nsitu observations were available. Genthon and Krinner\n[2001] have questioned the accuracy of the interpolation\nbecause it disagrees with the output of several numerical\nmodels of Antarctic precipitation and evaporation. It is\nuncertain whether the models share systematic errors or if\nthe interpolation of the in situ observations is inaccurate.\nHuybrechts et al. [2000] produced a map using similar\nmethods to Vaughan et al. [1999], including some additional\nin situ observations.\n[8] We will compare several different approach to the\ninterpolation of Antarctic in situ observations. These\ninclude (1) straightforward geostatistical interpolation of\nthe accumulation rate observations, (2) guiding this inter-\npolation using the correlation of accumulation rate with\nsaturation vapor pressure [Robin, 1977], (3) guiding the\ninterpolation using satellite microwave observations that\nare sensitive to layering within the snow-cover, and (4) a\ncombined model that includes temperature and microwave\nobservations. Our microwave method is a development of\none used by Winebrenner et al. [2001] to map accumula-\ntion rates for the dry snow region of Greenland. This\nmethod makes use of satellite observations of thermal\nmicrowave emission, at 4.5-cm wavelength, much longer\nthan the 35 GHz microwave observations used by Vaughan\net al. [1999]. Because of the longer wavelength, scattering\nby grains is less important, and reflections that occur\nwithin the layered snow have the dominant effect upon\nthe thermal emission [West et al., 1996]. In this paper, we\ninvestigate how the polarization induced by these reflec-\ntions varies in Antarctica and relate those variations to the\naccumulation rate.\n[9] Because of the variations of weather and climate that\noccur while it is deposited, the snow-cover of an ice sheet\nconsists of many layers of high and low density snow\ninterspersed [Colbeck, 1991]. The layering polarizes ther-\nmal microwave emission from the snow by acting as a\nreflective filter that preferentially transmits vertically polar-\nized emission to the satellite and preferentially reflects\nhorizontally polarized back to the depths [West et al.,\n1996]. Detecting the polarization using a satellite-borne\nradiometer allowed Winebrenner et al. [2001] to map the\nvariation in this filtering effect across the dry snow region of\nthe Greenland ice sheet. They used electromagnetic model-\nling and in situ observations collected from snowpits to\nrelate this variation to the accumulation rate.\n[10] Here, we extend the approach to investigate the\ncombined effects of accumulation rate and temperature\nupon the polarization of thermal emission from Antarctica.\nWe use observations of polarization recorded by the Ad-\nvanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) on the\nAqua satellite [Cavalieri and Comiso, 2004], and snow\ntemperatures derived from satellite observations of thermal\ninfrared emission under clear sky conditions [Comiso,\n2000]. Figure 1 shows the location of in situ observations\nof accumulation rate. We find a close relationship between\nthe accumulation rate measured at these sites and the\ntemperature and polarization derived from satellite obser-\nvations. Our map of accumulation rate is derived by\ncombining the satellite observations with the in situ obser-\nvations using a geostatistical approach that accounts prop-\nerly for spatial correlation among the observations.\n[11] Our approach to interpolation allows a more objec-\ntive estimate of errors than has been possible for previous\nstudies. We pay particular attention to how these errors will\naffect spatial integrations used to compute the ice budget\n[Rignot and Thomas, 2002]. Figure 1 shows the areas\ndraining into eight sectors of Antarctic coastline, assuming\nthat ice flow is in the direction of steepest descent, which\nwas computed using a digital elevation model of Antarctica\n[Bamber and Bindschadler, 1997]. We will estimate the\nspatially averaged accumulation rate for each of these\ndrainage sectors and evaluate confidence intervals for these\nestimates.\n2. Method\n[12] We could simply interpolate the in situ observations\nusing geostatistical interpolation method such as \u2018\u2018ordinary\nkriging\u2019\u2019 [Kitanidis, 1997]. However, the observations are\nfairly sparse, and their interpolation can be assisted by\nchoosing a suitable \u2018\u2018background\u2019\u2019 field that approximates\nthe spatial variations in the data [Vaughan et al., 1999].\nOrdinary kriging uses a spatially uniform background field.\nAnother possibility is to make use of the known correlation\nbetween accumulation rate and saturation vapor pressure\n[Robin, 1977], which varies strongly with temperature\naccording to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Then we\nmight choose as a background field\na \u0002 exp c1 \u00fe c2=T\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere a is accumulation rate, and T is the mean annual\nsurface temperature which is known reasonably well for\nFigure 1. The location of in situ observations, and the\nmajor drainage sectors of Antarctica considered in this\nstudy.\nD06107 ARTHERN ET AL.: ANTARCTIC SNOW ACCUMULATION\n2 of 10\nD06107\nAntarctica [Comiso, 2000]. We might expect differences\nbetween the mean annual surface temperature and the\natmospheric temperatures that control snowfall. Selecting\nthe parameters c1 and c2 using the in situ observations of\naccumulation rate, rather than thermodynamic theory, can\ncompensate for this to some degree.\n[13] In this paper we show that a much better choice of\nbackground field can be obtained by including microwave\nobservations from the AMSR-E satellite radiometer that are\nsensitive to the layering within the snow-cover [West et al.,\n1996].\n[14] AMSR-E observes thermally emitted microwave\nradiation at approximately 55\u0001 from vertical. Two channels\noperate at 6.9 GHz, which corresponds to a wavelength of\n4.3 cm in free space. The two channels measure the\nbrightness temperatures TB(V) at vertical polarization and\nTB(H) at horizontal. The polarization ratio\nP \u00bc TB V\u00f0 \u00de \u0001 TB H\u00f0 \u00de\nTB V\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe TB H\u00f0 \u00de \u00f02\u00de\nquantifies the polarization effect, and therefore provides an\nindirect measure of layering in the snow [West et al., 1996].\n[15] Winebrenner et al. [2001] analyzed data from the\nScanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer, a forerun-\nner to AMSR-E. Comparing these data with in situ obser-\nvations from the dry snow region of Greenland, they found\nthat polarization P was higher for sites with low accumu-\nlation rate a.\n[16] Winebrenner et al. [2001] investigated the reasons\nfor the relationship between polarization P and accumula-\ntion rate a by analyzing density profiles from snowpits. The\nsnowpit profiles show that the density stratification at sites\nwith high accumulation rate tends to have less variance on\nscales similar to the wavelength [Winebrenner et al.,\n2001]. Density stratification on this scale should have a\nstrong control on polarization, according to numerical\nsimulations of the reflection and transmission of thermally\nemitted microwave radiation within the snow deposit [West\net al., 1996; Winebrenner et al., 2001]. In the simulations\nthe snow-cover was modeled as a stack of layers, with\ndensity and thickness selected at random for each layer, to\nproduce realistic density profiles. The simulations predict\nthat greater variation in layer densities (on the wavelength\nscale) will increase polarization for the low accumulation\nrate sites above that of high accumulation sites, and this is\nwhat is observed. The simulations also show that thin,\nhigh-density crusts, a few millimeters thick, can influence\nthe polarization considerably [Surdyk and Fily, 1995;\nWinebrenner et al., 2001].\n[17] Aside from randomly varying deposition densities,\nanother potential source of density layering is seasonal.\nDensity differences between summer and winter snow\nlayers are commonly observed in polar regions. In central\nGreenland, seasonal density variations are neither large\nenough nor sharp enough to contribute effectively to the\npolarization at 4.5 cm wavelength [Winebrenner et al.,\n2001]. On the Antarctic plateau, accumulation rates are\nmuch lower, so the annual layer thickness approaches the\nscale of the wavelength. Periodic density stratification on\nthis scale would generate reflections and polarization.\nHowever, for such small annual layer thickness (\u000710 cm),\nreworking of the snow by the wind after deposition prob-\nably eliminates much of the systematic density contrast\nbetween summer and winter layers, leaving a much more\ndisordered layering.\n[18] To summarize, a combination of random centimeter-\nscale layering and thin millimeter-scale crusts probably\ncontrols the polarization, perhaps with some additional\ninfluence from seasonal layering. A predictive model of\nhow accumulation rate affects the development of snow\nlayering and metamorphism on scales of millimeters and\ncentimeters is presently beyond us. Instead, we shall inves-\ntigate a simple empirical model in which polarization ratio\ndecreases with increasing accumulation rate as a power law\na\u0001q, with exponent q yet to be determined. In addition, we\nexpect a component P0 of the polarization to arise from\nreflection at the air-snow interface as thermal emission\nleaves the snow. One possible model for the polarization\nthen takes the form\nP \u00bc P0 \u00fe k0a\u0001q \u00f03\u00de\nwhere the first term describes the polarization of surface\nreflection, and the second describes the influence of snow\nlayering upon the polarization, parameterized as a function\nof mean annual accumulation rate a(x). Defining n = 1\/q,\nk \b k0n, this suggests the following choice of background\nfield for the accumulation rate\na \u0002 k\nP \u0001 P0\u00f0 \u00den : \u00f04\u00de\nMany of the sintering and vapor transport processes that\ngenerate layering and crusts within the snow [Colbeck,\n1991] proceed at rates that vary strongly with temperature\naccording to Arrhenius-type relationships exp(\u0001J\/T). To\nallow for this effect, we shall also investigate a modified\nempirical model for the polarization which takes the form\nP \u00bc P0 \u00fe k0a\u0001qe\u0001J=T \u00f05\u00de\nwith constant parameters k0, q, and J. Again, the first term\ndescribes the polarization of surface reflection, but now\nthe influence of snow layering is parameterized as a\nfunction of mean annual accumulation rate a(x) and\ntemperature T(x). A strong temperature dependence may\nalso arise if sporadic summer melting produces reflective\ncrusts within the snow-cover. We expect that equation (5)\nwould capture this variability better than equation (3).\nNote that the optimum choice of k0, and possibly q, will\nbe different for equation (5) than for equation (3).\n[19] Rearranging equation (5) and defining n = 1\/q, k \b\nk0\nn and q \b Jn gives the following background field for the\naccumulation rate\na \u0002 ke\n\u0001q=T\nP \u0001 P0\u00f0 \u00den : \u00f06\u00de\nIn this paper we shall investigate four background fields of\nincreasing complexity: ordinary kriging (constant back-\nground); the saturation vapor pressure background defined\nby equation (1); the polarization only background defined\nby equation (4); and the combined temperature and\nD06107 ARTHERN ET AL.: ANTARCTIC SNOW ACCUMULATION\n3 of 10\nD06107\npolarization model defined by equation (6). All of these\nbackground fields can be viewed as special cases of\nequation (6), with either q = 0, n = 0, or both. Here we\nanalyze the performance of the simpler models in parallel,\nto guard against any overelaboration that is not warranted\nby the in situ observations.\n[20] We wish to be clear that we are undertaking an\nempirical study: the functional form of (5) is not predicted\nby any detailed theory, and other relationships between\naccumulation rate, temperature and polarization ratio, could\nof course be imagined. As it turns out, a suitable choice of\nparameters k, n, and q allows (6) to describe the relationship\nbetween temperature, accumulation rate and polarization\nratio quite well. In fact, we show in section 4 that this\nrelationship can explain nearly all the variance in the in situ\nobservations, except for a component which occurs on short\ndistance scales (less than 100 km). On the basis of this\nobservation we will ultimately use equation (6) as our\nbackground field to support the interpolation of the in situ\nobservations.\n[21] Mapping accumulation rate using equation (6)\nrequires us to evaluate all quantities on the right-hand side.\nPolarization ratio P(x) is available from AMSR-E observa-\ntions [Cavalieri and Comiso, 2004], except at latitudes near\nthe South Pole that are excluded from the satellite orbit. T can\nbe estimated using satellite observations of thermal infrared\nemission under clear sky conditions [Comiso, 2000].\n[22] We estimated P0 by computing the polarization of\nreflection at the air snow-interface for typical surface snow\ndensities. We obtained a mean value of P0 = 0.035 by\ncomputing horizontally and vertically polarized Fresnel\nreflection coefficients for over 1000 near-surface observa-\ntions of density from Antarctic snowpits [Goodwin, 1988;\nLong, 1961; Pirrit and Doumani, 1961; Stuart and Heine,\n1961]. We used expressions fromMatzler [1996] to relate the\ndensity to electromagnetic permittivity. The sample standard\ndeviation in P0 computed from these density observations\nwas 0.005, negligible compared to spatial variations in total\npolarization P. We therefore fix P0 = 0.035.\n[23] The parameters k, q and n still need to be determined.\nWe leave them as free parameters to be estimated during the\ninterpolation of the available in situ observations of accu-\nmulation rate ai (i = 1, 2. . .N). This approach allows us to\nuse equation (6) as a background field to constrain the\ninterpolation, while recognizing that we have no compelling\nreason a priori to adopt particular values for k, q and n.\n3. Universal Kriging\n[24] The interpolation and parameter estimation problem\nbecomes more straightforward if we solve for the logarith-\nmically transformed accumulation rate y(x), defined as\ny \b ln a: \u00f07\u00de\nThe transformation has two advantages: (1) it greatly\nsimplifies interpolation because the frequency distribution\nof ln ai more closely resembles a Gaussian than the\nasymmetric distribution of untransformed accumulation rate\nai (Figures 2a and 2b), so we can use standard least-squares\nmethods; and (2) it allows us to optimize the interpolation\nand parameter estimation using the geostatistical method of\nuniversal kriging [Kitanidis, 1997].\n[25] Essentially, we can write\ny \u00bc b\u00fe e; with b \b\nXJ\nj\u00bc1\ncjXj: \u00f08\u00de\nThe field e(x) is the residual from a background field b(x)\nrepresented as a linear combination of known spatial\npatterns Xj(x) each of which is multiplied by an amplitude\ncoefficient cj. Universal kriging allows the estimation of\ny(x), given knowledge of the patterns Xj and a vector of\nobservations z. The method simultaneously solves for the\ncoefficients cj that give the closest agreement between the\nbackground field and the observations.\n[26] In our case, the elements of the observation vector z\nare the transformed in situ accumulation rate measurements\nzi = ln ai, so we have\nzi \u00bc y xi\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe di; \u00f09\u00de\nFigure 2a.

Choosing a Background Model\n[27] We investigated four choices of background field.\nThe first,\nb \u00bc c1; \u00f010\u00de\nis constant everywhere and corresponds to ordinary kriging\nof the logarithmically transformed observations. The second\nchoice of background,\nb \u00bc c1 \u00fe c2X2;\nX2 \b 1\nT\n;\n\u00f011\u00de\nallows for variations of accumulation rate with temperature\nbut makes no use of the polarization observed by the\nAMSR-E radiometer. Allowing for the logarithmic trans-\nformation we have a \u0002 exp(c1 + c2\/T), so this choice of\nbackground corresponds to using the saturation vapor\npressure model defined by equation (1).\n[28] The third choice of background uses polarization\nonly\nb \u00bc c1 \u00fe c3X3;\nX3 \b ln P \u0001 P0\u00f0 \u00de:\n\u00f012\u00de\nThis corresponds to using (4) as a background model.\n[29] Fourth, and most generally, we use the logarithm of\nequation (6) as a background field, which gives\nb \u00bc c1 \u00fe c2X2 \u00fe c3X3: \u00f013\u00de\nIn each case, the Xj are determined entirely by satellite\nobservations and other known quantities (P(x), T(x), P0).\nThe coefficients are left as free parameters to be determined\nfrom the in situ observations, so the values of c1, c2 and c3\nvary depending upon which background model is used. For\nthe most general model (13), we have\nc1 \b ln k; c2 \b \u0001q; c3 \b \u0001n; \u00f014\u00de\nso applying universal kriging, with (13) as the background\nfield, automatically selects the best values for the\nunconstrained parameters k, q, and n (i.e., those values that\nminimize discrepancies with the in situ observations).\n[30] We characterize the spatial statistics of departures\nfrom each of the background fields by computing their\nsemivariogram [Kitanidis, 1997]. For now, we assume that\nthese statistics are homogenous and isotropic. The semi-\nvariogram of residuals is then defined as\ngzz hij\n\u0002 \u0003 \b 1\n2\nzi \u0001 b xi\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \n \u0001 zj \u0001 b xj\n\u0002 \u0003\u0004 \u0005\u0006 \u00072D E\n; \u00f015\u00de\nwhere angled brackets represent expected quantities, and the\nlocations xi and xj are separated by a distance hij = jxi \u0001 xjj.\n[31] For each background model, Figure 3 shows an\nempirical approximation to gzz(h). These were evaluated\nat a set of evenly spaced distance intervals using the method\ndescribed in Appendix A. All four semivariograms are well\napproximated by linear models of the form\ngzz h\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc a\u00fe bh; h > 0: \u00f016\u00de\nThe intercept a is similar in all cases and represents the\ncombined contribution to the variance of ln ai made by\nmeasurement errors, any temporal variations that decorr-\nelate between measurements, and short-scale spatial varia-\nbility. Clearly, none of the background models can capture\nthis component of the variation.\n[32] The intercept a = 0.1 corresponds to r.m.s. short-\nscale variability of about \u00b130% in ai, when the logarithmic\ntransformation is taken into account. This is comparable to\nthe short-scale spatial variability (20%\u201360%) estimated\nindependently using ground-penetrating radar [Richardson\net al., 1997].\n[33] Turning to the broader-scale patterns, the linear term\nbh in the semivariogram shows that residuals e(x) exhibit\never larger fluctuations at increasing spatial scales. The\nsemivariograms do not reach a plateau or sill at any scale,\nso there seems to be no preferred length scale for relative\nvariations in the accumulation rate with respect to any of the\nbackground models.\n[34] The semivariogram for the constant-background\nmodel (10) has the largest gradient b. By contrast, when\nwe use the temperature-compensated polarization model\n(13), derived from equation (6), the gradient b approaches\nzero. This shows that the background field defined by (13)\ncaptures nearly all of the variation on scales larger than\n100 km. When either temperature or polarization are\nignored, as in equations (1) and (3), the background field\ncaptures only about half of the broad-scale variability. We\nconclude that a combination of temperature and polarization\nFigure 3.

Producing a Map\n[35] It is important to understand that we are not seeking\nto map variations in accumulation rate at very fine spatial\nscales. The brightness temperatures recorded by the AMSR\nradiometer are representative of a footprint on the ground\nthat is roughly 60 km in diameter. Given the sparsity of the\nin situ measurements, the highest spatial resolution we can\nhope for is comparable with the dimension of the satellite\nfootprint. Since our main interest is in deriving spatial\naverages of accumulation rate across drainage basins, the\naveraging performed by the satellite is advantageous. The\nsemivariograms show that point measurements are likely to\nsuffer from 30% r.m.s. short-scale variations when com-\npared to the broad-scale (e.g., 104 km2) average accumula-\ntion rate in the region where the measurements are taken.\nClearly, it is desirable to optimize the interpolation so that\nthe short-scale variability does not unduly influence our\nmap.\n[36] Similar considerations apply to temporal averaging.\nThe satellite observations of microwave polarization are\nsensitive to layering in the snow that has been deposited\nover many hundreds, even thousands, of years, so they\nrepresent a long-term average. The temperature observa-\ntions were averaged over the interval 1982\u20131997 but can be\nexpected to approximate the long-term mean temperatures\nfairly closely, since these are controlled to a great degree by\nthe elevation of the surface. The most important consider-\nation is that we have chosen the parameters that best fit the\nin situ observations.\n[37] Table 1 shows the frequency distribution of the 540\nin situ observations for which start and end dates are\nreported by Vaughan and Russell [1997]. In computing\nTable 1, measurements spanning more than 1 decade were\ndistributed in proportion to the fraction of the total mea-\nsurement interval that lay within each decade. Broadly\nspeaking, the in situ observations sample accumulation that\nfell as snow between 1950 and 1990.\n[38] To produce a map of the annual-mean snow accu-\nmulation, we must reduce the impact of measurement errors,\nand temporal variability as best we can. It is impossible to\nresolve the short-scale spatial variability using the measure-\nments available to us. Rather than force our map to\nreproduce every observation we therefore aim only to\nrepresent the broad-scale accumulation patterns. We do this\nby the method of continuous-part universal kriging as\ndescribed by Kitanidis [1997]. In this approach, a filter is\ndesigned that optimally smooths out the variability that\ncontributes to the intercept a of the semivariogram, leaving\nthe best approximation to the longer-wavelength spatial\nvariations. We defer the details of this to Appendix B.\n[39] The outcome of the estimation procedure is a set of\naccumulation rate estimates a^ for each cell of a rectangular\ngrid in polar stereographic coordinates (defined by the\nWGS84 ellipsoid, and latitude of true scale at 71S).\n[40] We also consider averages over the major drainage\nsectors of Antarctica (Figure 1). We represent the areal\nintegration of accumulation over some region through a\nsimple numerical quadrature defined by\nA^ \u00bc Ha^; \u00f017\u00de\nwith elements of the row vector H being equal to the area\nrepresented by the grid cell if that cell is to be included in\nthe integration, and zero otherwise. More sophisticated\nintegration schemes could also be written in this form.\n[41] Continuous-part universal kriging is an example of\nbest linear unbiased estimation (BLUE), for which well-\nknown error estimates are available under the assumption\nthat measurement errors, and departures from the back-\nground field, have Gaussian statistics. The details of the\nerror analysis are presented in Appendix C.\n[42] One might argue that the preliminary background\nfield would itself be a useful map of accumulation rate,\nwithout resorting to the kriging approach. We have retained\nthe kriging step, however, for three reasons. (1) The slope of\nthe semivariogram (though much reduced for our chosen\nbackground field) is not eliminated entirely, so there remain\nsome residual broad-scale patterns that can be removed by\ninterpolation. (2) By using the background as a guide, rather\nthan a strong constraint, our map will locally defer to nearby\nobservations (which may be confirmed by direct inspection\nof how individual measurements are being weighted). This\ncapacity for local adjustment might be important in regions\nwhere the microwave observations are affected by atypical\nprocesses such as melting and refreezing. (3) By accounting\nproperly for spatial corellation, we expect to obtain better\nestimates of model parameters than from a straightforward\nunweighted least squares fit.\n6. Results\n[43] Figure 4 shows the map of accumulation rate. The\nmain features are similar to previous compilations [Vaughan\net al., 1999; Giovinetto and Zwally, 2000; Huybrechts et al.,\n2000]. Generally speaking, high accumulation in coastal\nregions gives way to very low accumulation rates in the\ninterior of the continent. In coastal regions of East Antarc-\ntica, slopes that face east typically receive higher accumu-\nlation than slopes that face west.\n[44] On closer inspection there are differences between\nthe new map and earlier ones. Figures 5 and 6 show\ndifferences between the new map and the earlier compila-\ntion of Vaughan et al. [1999]. There are regions where\ndifferences exceed 100 kg m\u00012 a\u00011. Since the same in situ\nobservations were used for both maps, these differences\nmust arise from the different approaches to interpolation.\nOur analysis suggests that the compilation of Vaughan et\nal. [1999] overestimates accumulation rates in the sector\n90\u2013120\u0001E, and underestimates accumulation in Marie\nByrd Land 210\u2013250\u0001W, and east of the Amery Ice Shelf\nTable 1.

Genthon and Krinner [2001] obtain a similar\npattern of differences between a composite of numerical\natmospheric models and the Vaughan et al. [1999] map,\nwhich suggests that the new map may eliminate some of\nthe discrepancy between model results and compilations\nof in situ data. Figure 5 shows differences between the\nnew map and the earlier compilation of Giovinetto and\nZwally [2000]. Again the general pattern of accumulation\nis very similar for the two maps, but there are regions\nwhere differences exceed 100 kg m\u00012 a\u00011. Our map has\nlower accumulation over Thwaites drainage basin than\neither Vaughan et al. [1999] or Giovinetto and Zwally\n[2000] which suggests that Rignot and Thomas [2002]\nmay have underestimated the net loss of ice to the ocean\nfrom this region. Detailed comparisons of the new map\nwith measurements of the ice-flux drained by the major\noutlet glaciers will be needed to assess the state of balance\nof various regions, and how this differs from estimates\nderived using the earlier maps of accumulation rate.\n[45] The error analysis described in Appendix C allows us\nto estimate the root mean square error in the new map. This\nis plotted in Figure 7, as a percentage of the mapped value at\neach location. Generally, the r.m.s. errors are lower than\n10%. This means that we would expect a full survey of the\naverage accumulation within a region about 104 km2 in area\nto agree with our map to this precision. We know from our\nearlier analysis that any individual snowpit or ice core will\ndisagree by about 30% r.m.s. because of the short-scale\nspatial variations.\n[46] The value of including the satellite observations is\ndemonstrated by performing an identical analysis using the\nconstant background field (10) in place of equation (13).\nWithout the satellite information, there would be regions\nFigure 5.

The errors for spatial averages are derived in Appendix C.\nThese error estimates are also listed in Table 2. Assuming\nnormally distributed errors, and doubling r.m.s. errors to\ngive approximate 95% confidence intervals, we estimate the\nprecision of these spatial integrations at 5\u201310%.\n[48] Table 2 also shows the value obtained by averaging the\nnewmapover all regions of grounded ice, 143 \u00b14 kgm\u00012 a\u00011.\nThis is slightly lower than the estimate of 149 kg m\u00012 a\u00011\nobtained by Church et al. [2001] as an average of studies\npublished since 1995, but lies within the range of variability\nof those studies. We also repeated our analysis, just using the\n546 in situ measurements for which Vaughan and Russell\n[1997] report start and end dates for the measurement inter-\nvals (see Table 1). This changed the average accumulation by\nless than 2%, so we consider the average snowfall derived\nfrom themap to be broadly representative of the epoch 1950\u2013\n2000. It is true though that field surveys have concentrated\nupon different basins at different times. A fuller examination\nof temporal fluctuations in accumulation rate, and the spatio-\ntemporal sampling of those fluctuations by the various field\ncampaigns that have operated in Antarctica would be useful,\nespecially if temporal changes in accumulation rate are to be\ninvestigated by comparing our map with future versions.\n7. Discussion\n[49] The functional form of equation (5) was not pre-\ndicted by any detailed theory of snow deposition or meta-\nmorphism. Nevertheless, the parameters recovered by\nuniversal kriging may provide some insight into the depen-\ndence of polarization (and by implication the processes that\ncontrol snow stratification) upon temperature and accumu-\nlation rate. We estimate the value of q as 1.9 \u00b1 0.3, so\npolarization ratio caused by layering varies approximately\nas the inverse square of accumulation rate. We estimate the\nparameter J as 3500 \u00b1 800 K. This corresponds to a\ntemperature dependence of the form exp(\u0001E\/RT) with\nR \b 8.314 J K\u00011 mol \u00011 being the gas constant, and\nactivation energy E \u0002 29 \u00b1 7 kJ mol\u00011, of comparable\nmagnitude, but somewhat lower, than the temperature\ndependence of sintering estimated from empirical observa-\ntions of snow compaction in the upper layers of Antarctic\nfirn [Alley, 1987; Kojima, 1964].\n[50] It is impossible to rule out fortuitous correlations\nbetween temperature, accumulation rate, and other factors\nthat promote stratification, such as wind, solar radiation, or\nsporadic melting. Thus we do not suggest that wind, melt,\nor radiation are not important in determining the stratifica-\ntion of Antarctic snow, only that, if they are important, their\neffect upon the polarization can successfully be described in\nterms of mean annual temperature and accumulation rate for\na wide variety of snow types and climatic conditions.\nModels of the depositional and metamorphic processes\nwhich generate density stratification and crusts have been\ndeveloped and tested for Alpine conditions [e.g., Lehning et\nal., 2002]. Similar models could be used to investigate the\nimportance of individual processes upon the stratification\nunder Antarctic conditions.\n[51] Although we do not have a complete physical\nexplanation for equation (6), it is quite successful at explain-\ning the variation in accumulation rate across the Antarctic\nice sheet. The compilation of in situ measurements is fairly\nextensive, so the background field defined by equation (6)\nneed only provide limited assistance to interpolation. Our\nerror analysis demonstrates that it is adequate for that\npurpose, providing useful information about accumulation\nrate in regions of the ice sheet that are poorly sampled by\nfield surveys.\n[52] We must add a caveat that few of the in situ\nobservations used to derive the surface reflection P0, or to\nconstrain the background model, come from regions that are\nsubject to significant melting and runoff, or to substantial\nmeltwater percolation and refreezing within the snow.\nMelting has a strong effect upon the microwave scattering\nproperties of the snow-cover, so values of net snow accu-\nmulation and the errors computed here are at best provi-\nsional for ablation and percolation zones and may well turn\nout to be inappropriate. Regions where such strong melting\noccurs make up a small areal fraction of Antarctica, mostly\nconfined to peripheral ice shelves.\n[53] The error estimates derived in Appendix C are based\nupon several assumptions. We have assumed that after\nlogarithmic transformation, departures from the background\nfield are statistically similar at all places and in all direc-\ntions, so that the semivariogram is purely a function of\nseparation. We have also assumed that the departures from\nthe background field have a Gaussian distribution. These\nassumptions are common in geostatistical interpolation.\nNevertheless, they have been forced upon us more by the\nlimited number of in situ observations than by any stronger\ncompulsion. Further in situ observations might reveal that\ndepartures from the background cannot be regarded as a\nhomogenous, isotropic, Gaussian field. In that case our error\nestimates would need to be revised, and more elaborate\ninversion methods would be needed to produce a map. The\nassumptions we have made here are perhaps most suspect\nnear sharp linear boundaries between high and low accu-\nmulation. Meteorological effects can cause sudden jumps in\naccumulation rate across ice divides so that departures from\nthe smooth background field might locally be bimodal,\nrather than Gaussian, and the departures from the smooth\nbackground field might also become anisotropic and inho-\nmogenous. In any case, the limited resolution of the\nsatellite, and the sparsity of the field observations, means\nthat jumps in accumulation rate across divides are likely\nto be much smoother in our map than in reality. The\neffect of this smoothing upon calculations of ice budget\nTable 2.

Conclusions\n[54] We have carried out an empirical investigation into\nthe relationship between mean annual temperature, accu-\nmulation rate, and the polarization of thermally emitted\nmicrowaves. The microwave emission at 4.3 cm wavelength\nwas viewed from a direction 55\u0001 from the local vertical by\nthe AMSR-E radiometer. We find that the polarization\nvaries with accumulation rate according to an inverse square\npower law, and with temperature according to an Arrhenius\ntype relationship with apparent activation energy 29 \u00b1 7 kJ\nmol\u00011. When we invert this relationship for the accumula-\ntion rate, it is able to explain most of the variation in in situ\nobservations of accumulation rate on scales greater than\nabout 100 km. It therefore provides a suitable background\nfield to support the interpolation of those observations.\n[55] After a logarithmic transformation we performed\nthe interpolation using continuous-part universal kriging,\na linear estimation method that allows several of the\nparameters that define the background field to be esti-\nmated during interpolation. Continuous-part universal\nkriging removes the short scale spatial variability that\ncontributes to the variance among measurements. The\nmethod is an example of best linear unbiased estimation\n(BLUE), a class of inverse methods for which estimates\nof the error may be derived, under the assumption that\nmeasurement errors and residuals from the background\nfield have Gaussian distributions.\n[56] We estimate the effective resolution of our map to\nbe in the region of 100 km. On spatial scales smaller than\n104 km2 we expect accumulation rates to vary significantly\nfrom the gridded values that we obtain from our universal\nkriging analysis.\n[57] Averaging our map over the major drainage sectors\nof Antarctica, we are able to estimate the average accumu-\nlation rate to a precision of 10% or better. Averaging over\nthe grounded ice of Antarctica, we estimate that from 1950\nto 2000 the mean annual accumulation of snow in Antarc-\ntica was 143 \u00b1 4 kg m\u00012 a\u00011.\nAppendix A: Estimation of the Semivariogram\n[58] The first step in computing the semivariogram is to\nuse the observation vector z to solve for a rough approxi-\nmation b^ to the background field at the observations sites.\nFor each in situ observation site (i = 1, 2, . . ., N) we define\nthe ith row of an N \f 3 matrix Xz as [1, 1\/Ti, ln(Pi \u0001 P0)], in\nwhich Pi and Ti are the polarization and temperature,\ndetermined from satellite observations. The rough approx-\nimation b^ is then defined by b^ \b Xzc^, where c^ is the\nunweighted least squares solution of z = Xzc^. The empirical\napproximation to the semivariogram for a given distance\ninterval is obtained by computing the sample mean of\n1\n2\n[(zi \u0001 b^i) \u0001 (zj \u0001 b^j)]2 for all pairs of observations zi\nand zj that are separated by distances within that interval.\nSee Kitanidis [1997] for further details.\nAppendix B: Solving for Accumulation Rate\n[59] We define a rectangular grid of locations, then seek\nan estimate a^ of the average accumulation rate within each\ngrid cell. The first step is to solve for y^, an estimate of the\nlogarithmically transformed accumulation rate for each grid\npoint, using the logarithmically transformed in situ mea-\nsurements of accumulation rate zi \b ln ai. Universal kriging\nis an application of best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE).\nWe write the estimates as a linear combination of the\nobservations,\ny^ \u00bc +z; \u00f0B1\u00de\nwith y^ being a column vector composed of estimates y^ for\nall grid locations and + being a matrix of weights to be\ndetermined. The weights + are chosen to satisfy the BLUE\nequation:\n\u0001gzz Xz\nXTz 0\n2\n4\n3\n5 +\nT\nM\n2\n4\n3\n5 \u00bc\n\u0001;zy\nXTy\n2\n4\n3\n5: \u00f0B2\u00de\nIn equation (B2), T denotes the matrix transpose. The matrix\ngzz depends upon the intercept and slope of the semivar-\niogram. It has elements a(1 \u0001 dij) + bhij, with hij being the\ndistance between sites of the ith and jth in situ measure-\nments and dij being the Kronecker delta. The matrix gzy has\nelements a + bhik, where hik is the distance between the ith\nmeasurement and the kth grid location. The matrix Xz is\ndefined in Appendix A. The matrix Xy is defined similarly,\nbut for grid locations, so its kth row is [1, 1\/Tk, ln(Pk \u0001 P0)],\nwith Pk and Tk evaluated from satellite observations at the\nkth grid point. The system of equations (B2) is designed so\nthat solving for the matrix of Lagrange multipliers M along\nwith the weights + ensures the solution defined by equation\n(B1) is unbiased, and gives a maximum likelihood solution\nfor y^ when errors and departures from the background field\nhave a Gaussian distribution. For further details of best\nlinear unbiased estimation and continuous-part universal\nkriging, see Kitanidis [1997].\n[60] Once y^ has been determined using equation (B1) and\nequation (B2), the accumulation rate a^ is found by reversing\nthe logarithmic transformation so that a^ = c exp \u00bdy^]. The\nmultiplicative correction factor c is needed because the\nthree-step procedure (transformation, interpolation, reverse-\ntransformation) would otherwise lead to biased results. We\ndetermine c by requiring that a^h i should equal a^ih i at\nmeasurement locations, angled brackets denoting expected\nquantities.\n[61] Suppose a is the true accumulation averaged over\nthe grid cell.

We use a, the intercept\nof the semivariogram, as our estimate for hd2i. Our estimate\nof hn2i is based on the error analysis of universal kriging\n(Appendix C). Since a \u0002 0.1, and is considerably larger\nthan our estimates of hn2i, we obtain c \u0002 1.05 everywhere,\nso applying this correction increases the accumulation rate\nby approximately 5%.\nAppendix C: Errors\n[62] If y is the vector of log-transformed accumulation\nrate for all grid cells, the error in our estimate is n \b y^ \u0001 y.\nFollowing Kitanidis [1997], the error covariance Cnn \b\nhnnTi, with angled brackets denoting expected quantities, is\nCnn = \u0001XyM \u0001 gyy + gzyT+T, where gyy has elements a +\nbhkl, and the distance hkl separates the kth and lth grid\npoints. When the errors are small enough to neglect terms of\norder O(n2), Taylor series expansion of the logarithm (7)\nimplies that a \u0002 a^ \u0001 a^DN, where a^D is the square diagonal\nmatrix with leading diagonal a^. The absolute error in\naccumulation rate \u0005 \b a^ \u0001 a then has covariance C\u0005\u0005 \b\nh\u0005\u0005Ti approximately given by C\u0005\u0005 \u0002 a^DCNNa^D. When\nequation (17) is used to form areal averages, and A\nrepresents the true accumulation integrated over the\nselected region, the variance of the error D \b A^ \u0001 A is\ngiven by hD2i = Ha^DCNNa^DHT.\n[63] Acknowledgments.
