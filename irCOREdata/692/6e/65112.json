H. Streeter. The\npurpose of this article is not to advocate an alternative hypothesis but to argue\nthat, if the Q hypothesis is to be sustained, the unlikelihood of Luke\u2019s depen-\ndence on Matthew must be demonstrated by a systematic and comprehensive\nreconstruction of the redactional procedures entailed in the two hypotheses.\nThe Q hypothesis will have been verified if (and only if) it generates a more\nplausible account of the Matthean and Lukan redaction of Mark and Q than\nthe corresponding account of Luke\u2019s use of Mark and Matthew.\nKeywords: Q, synoptic problem, source criticism, two source hypothesis\nQ has a secure place within an account of synoptic origins that established\nitself in the later nineteenth century, and that has remained dominant ever since. If\nQ is a \u2018hypothesis\u2019, so too is Markan priority. If we are to dispense with modern\nscholarly hypotheses, we would have to rethink the gospels in purely ahistorical,\nsynchronic terms, as parallel texts whose interrelationship should not be further\ninvestigated.\uf644 That would be to revert not only to a pre-Enlightenment but also\nto a pre-Augustinian perspective.\uf645 For Q to be a hypothesis is not in itself a problem.\nReminders of Q\u2019s hypothetical status are usually intended as warnings not to\nproceed as though Q were an established fact, a newly discovered document of\n\uf644 \u2018Narrative criticism\u2019 does not characteristically claim that synoptic interrelations should not be\ninvestigated at all\u2014only that source-critical investigation should not be made foundational for\nall other forms of gospel scholarship.\n\uf645 Augustine is usually credited with the view that Mark was dependent on Matthew as his \u2018fol-\nlower and summarizer\u2019 (pedisequus et breviator)\u2014the so-called \u2018Augustinian hypothesis\u2019. In\nfact, Augustine changed his mind in the course of writing De Consensu Evangelistarum, con-\ncluding that Mark was more probably dependent on both Matthew and Luke, and thereby\nanticipating the so-called \u2018Griesbach hypothesis\u2019 (see de cons. evang. i.\uf645.\uf647; iv.\uf644\uf643.\uf644\uf644). More sig-\nnificant than either theory is the fact that Augustine advocated literary dependence at all, in\nopposition to the dominant tradition of independent authorship. John Kloppenborg\u2019s sugges-\ntion that Augustine does not actually envisage literary dependence is unlikely, given the use of\nbreviator and the vacillation between one theory and another; see his Excavating Q: The\nHistory and Setting of the Sayings Gospel (Minneapolis: Fortress, \uf645\uf643\uf643\uf643) \uf646\uf64bn. \uf646\uf64c\uf64a\nNew Test.

Yet it misunderstands what a hypothesis is for. It\nassumes that a hypothesis is characterized by its uncertainty, referring as it does\nto probabilities or possibilities whose actuality can never be reliably established.\nA hypothesis is not simply an informed guess or speculation, however. Its purpose\nis to present itself for ongoing critical testing, in order to ascertain whether it can\nprovide a more plausible explanation of the relevant data than its rivals. If it is suc-\ncessful in this regard, it will have attained the fact-like status to which it aspires.\uf647\nThe plausibility of a hypothesis is dependent in part on the implausibility of its\nmain alternatives. This point has been recognized in principle in Q research\u2014and\nnecessarily so, since Q is premised on the unlikelihood that either of the later evange-\nlists is dependent on the other in addition to Mark. Yet the arguments for this unli-\nkelihood are typically asserted as though self-evident, without any attempt to\nsubstantiate them in detail. From B. H. Streeter and others, we learn (\uf644) that, after\nthe material relating to the beginnings of Jesus\u2019 ministry, Luke\u2019s insertion of\ndouble tradition material into the Markan sequence bears no relation to\nMatthew\u2019s; (\uf645) that Luke\u2019s allegedly disordered presentation of Jesus\u2019 teaching\ndemonstrates his ignorance of the orderly Matthean discourses, especially the\nSermon on the Mount; and (\uf646) that the more primitive version of a particular\nsaying is sometimes found in the one gospel, sometimes in the other. Q is the\nproduct of arguments such as these.\uf648 It is assumed (rightly, in my view) that\nMatthew and Luke both use Mark, and that the most significant rival to the Q\nhypothesis is the hypothesis that Luke used Matthew as well as Mark (referred to\nhenceforth as the Luke\/Matthew or L\/M hypothesis.)\uf649 Given these parameters, the\n\uf646 Thus A. Lindemann writes: \u2018[E]s bleibt die Frage, ob eine umfassende literarische Analyse und\ntheologische Auslegung der Logienquelle, die der Analyse und Interpretation der synop-\ntischen Evangelien vergleichbar w\u00e4re, wirklich m\u00f6glich ist\u2019 (\u2018Die Logienquelle Q: Fragen\nan eine gut begr\u00fcndete Hypothese\u2019, The Sayings Source Q and the Historical Jesus [ed.\nA Lindemann; Leuven: Leuven University, \uf645\uf643\uf643\uf644] \uf646\u2013\uf645\uf649, here \uf645\uf649).\n\uf647 According to John Kloppenborg, \u2018[n]o volume of support for a hypothesiswill ever turn it into a\nfact\u2019, for \u2018hypotheses are our ways of configuring and accounting for data\u2026\u2019 (Excavating Q, \uf646;\nitalics original). In practice Kloppenborg usually treats Q as though it were a fact. If the argu-\nments for the Q hypothesis are as strong as he believes them to be, he is not wrong to do so.\n\uf648 B. H. Streeter, The Four Gospels: A Study of Origins (London: Macmillan, \uf644\uf64c\uf646\uf643) \uf644\uf64b\uf646\u2013\uf647; W. G.\nK\u00fcmmel, Introduction to the NewTestament (London: SCM, \uf644\uf64c\uf64a\uf648) \uf649\uf646\u2013\uf647. Streeter devotes five para-\ngraphs to the independenceofMatthewandLukeandtheconsequentexistenceofQ;K\u00fcmmel,one.\nChristopher Tuckett bases his case for the existence of Q on four \u2018traditional arguments\u2019which do\nnot go significantly beyond Streeter (Q and the History of Earliest Christianity: Studies on Q\n[Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark, \uf644\uf64c\uf64c\uf64c] \uf64a\u2013\uf644\uf644). W. D. Davies and D. C. Allison devote fourteen lines to the\nargument for Q rather than Luke\u2019s use of Matthew, and merely repeat Streeter\u2019s familiar claims\n(The Gospel according to Saint Matthew [ICC; \uf646 vols.; Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark, \uf644\uf64c\uf64b\uf64b\u2013\uf64c\uf64a] \uf644.\uf644\uf644\uf649).\n\uf649 The usual nomenclature\u2014the \u2018Farrer hypothesis\u2019, the \u2018Farrer\u2013Goulder hypothesis\u2019\u2014should\nbe abandoned, for two reasons. First, the L\/M possibility is a concern not just of this or that\n\uf646\uf64c\uf64b F RANC I S WATSON\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 May 2010 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nconventional arguments are not without force. But whether they represent a properly\nrigorous testing of the Q hypothesis is another matter. A systematic investigation of\nthe Q hypothesis would have to compare the redactional procedures entailed by both\nthe Q and the L\/M hypotheses, since it is the alleged implausibility of the latter that\ncreates the need for the former. It is inadequate merely to assert without argument\nthat, on the L\/M hypothesis \u2018it would be difficult to account for the fact that Luke\u2019s\nplacement of the double tradition differs almost entirely from that of Matthew\u2019\u2014and\nto found a whole new document of primitive Christianity on that assertion.\uf64a\nEach hypothesis entails an account of a consequent redactional procedure\nwhich it should be possible to retrace. Q generates, as it were, a double redactional\nprocess, as it is independently incorporated along with Mark into the work of the\ntwo later evangelists. The L\/M hypothesis is concerned with the single process in\nwhich Luke edits Matthew. If the Q hypothesis can produce a more intelligible,\ncoherent and plausible account of the double redaction than the L\/M hypothesis\ncan of its single redaction, then\u2014within the parameters of the investigation\u2014it\nwill have been verified. If not, then Q may have to be returned to the limbo of prob-\nabilities and possibilities, or rejected altogether. Indeed, my argument here will tend\ntowards this latter conclusion. My intention is not, however, to produce arguments\nin favour of Luke\u2019s knowledge of Matthew and against Q. Rather, the point is a\nmethodological one: to demonstrate the need for a comparative and systematic\nstudy of the redactional procedures entailed in competing source-critical hypotheses.\nThe redactional procedures consequent on both Q and Luke\u2019s use of Matthewmust\nboth be reconstructed and compared if the Q hypothesis is to be rigorously assessed.\nEven so, the discussion will be limited in scope. Other hypotheses\u2014the\n\u2018Griesbach\u2019 theory, for example, according to which Mark is dependent on both\nMatthew and Luke\u2014will not come directly into consideration. Neither will the\nview that the predominantly oral\/aural culture of the early church makes the dis-\ncussion of purely literary relationships redundant. Oral tradition may influence a\nlater evangelist\u2019s handling of an earlier text, but it is still possible and necessary to\ndescribe the relationship in literary, redaction-critical terms.\uf64b\nscholar but of anyone seriously wishing to assess Q itself. Second, the case for Luke\u2019s use of\nMatthew is best articulated not by Farrer or Goulder but by Mark Goodacre, whose book,\nThe Case against Q (Harrisburg: Trinity, \uf645\uf643\uf643\uf645) is fundamental to the renewed debate. See\nalso Mark Goodacre and Nicholas Perrin, ed., Questioning Q (London: SPCK, \uf645\uf643\uf643\uf647).\n\uf64a Kloppenborg, Excavating Q, \uf646\uf643.\n\uf64b For a succinct defence of the need for literary explanations, see Kloppenborg, Excavating Q,\n\uf644\uf64b. Kloppenborg appeals to (\uf644) \u2018[s]trong verbal agreements\u2026between each pair of Gospels\u2019,\nand (\uf645) \u2018striking agreements in the sequence of pericopae\u2019, especially significant given that\n\u2018the relative ordering of most of the Synoptic pericopae is not intrinsically determined by\ntheir content\u2019.\nQ as Hypothesis \uf646\uf64c\uf64c\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 May 2010 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nIt will be convenient to base this investigation on the rendering of Q material in\n(\uf644) Matthew \uf646\u2013\uf647 = Luke \uf646\u2013\uf647; (\uf645) Matthew \uf648\u2013\uf64a = Luke \uf649 (with parts of chs. \uf644\uf644\u2013\uf644\uf649); and\n(\uf646) Matthew \uf64b\u2013\uf644\uf645 = Luke \uf64a\u2013\uf644\uf644. The aim is to cover most of the contents of Q, in the\nhope that the clarity of an overview will compensate for unavoidable lack of atten-\ntion to detail.\uf64c For the text of Q I shall use the Critical Edition of Robinson, Hoffmann\nand Kloppenborg,\uf644\uf643 although alternative possibilities will also be acknowledged.\nI shall assume Q except where the rival L\/M hypothesis is under consideration.\n\uf644. Parallel Redaction\nMatthew and Luke provide similar accounts of the beginnings of Jesus\u2019min-\nistry, and\u2014according to the Q hypothesis\u2014the similarities derive from their inde-\npendent use of both Mark and Q. At the point where the later evangelists first make\ncontact with these two sources, a tendency to proceed in parallel has already\nbecome evident in their independent decision to supplement Mark with birth\nstories. As we shall see, the Q hypothesis entails a whole series of similar yet inde-\npendent redactional moves on the part of Matthew and Luke. The question is how\nfar this parallelism constitutes a problem for the hypothesis.\nIn the introductory account of the ministry of John the Baptist (Mark \uf644.\uf644\u2013\uf649 +\npars.), minor agreements between Matthew and Luke against Mark may indicate\nthat Q too began at this point. Matthew and Luke agree against Mark in their refer-\nences to \u2018all the region of the Jordan\u2019, as an area from which crowds came to John\n(Matt \uf646.\uf648) or as part of John\u2019s own sphere of activity (Luke \uf646.\uf646). Both later evange-\nlists cite Isa \uf647\uf643.\uf646 without the non-Isaianic elements present in Mark (Mark \uf644.\uf645\u2013\uf646;\nMatt \uf646.\uf646; Luke \uf646.\uf647). These minor agreements may suggest that the later evangelists\nwere able to draw on a parallel Q introduction to the ministry of John the Baptist,\nin addition to Mark. Other phraseology, unique to Matthew or Luke, may also be\nderived from Q, though the lack of agreement with the other evangelist makes it\ndifficult to identify as such.\uf644\uf644 A Q introduction is required not just to account for\nthe minor agreements, however, but also to prepare for the passage that follows.\nHere, a sample is given of the Baptist\u2019s harsh proclamation of judgment to those\nhe describes as a \u2018brood of vipers\u2019, and this is clearly derived from Q (Matt \uf646.\uf64a\u2013\uf644\uf643;\nLuke \uf646.\uf64a\u2013\uf64c). The almost complete verbal agreement demonstrates the need for a\nliterary explanation of the relationship between Matthew and Luke. Yet this\npassage cannot represent the beginning of Q; the speaker is not even named in\n\uf64c I hope to provide a fuller discussion of these matters in Chapters \uf646 and \uf647 of a book provision-\nally entitled, Receiving Jesus: Gospel Writing in Canonical Perspective, scheduled for publi-\ncation in \uf645\uf643\uf644\uf644.\n\uf644\uf643 James M.

There must, then, be a Q component as well as a Markan one in the Matthean\nand Lukan passages in which the Baptist is introduced.\nWe already note that the double redactional procedure entailed in the Q hypoth-\nesis requires both later evangelists independently to make broadly similar choices.\nIn the introductory passage, they choose to conflate elements of Mark with\nelements of Q, and they supplement this passage with the Q judgment oracle\nwhich they both cite almost verbatim. The parallelism extends into the passage\non the Coming One that follows. As formatted below, underlinings represent\nwords or phrases unique to a single evangelist; italics, points where the\nwording of Matthew and Luke agrees against Mark; [A] and [B\uf644,\uf645], the distribution\nof the Coming One and double baptism sayings.\n[A] There comes one stronger than me after me, and I am not worthy to stoop\nand undo the strap of his sandals. [B\uf644] I baptize you with water, [B\uf645] but he will\nbaptize you with the Holy Spirit. (Mark \uf644.\uf64a\u2013\uf64b)\n[B\uf644] I indeed baptize you in water for repentance; [A] but the one who comes\nafter me is stronger than me, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. [B\uf645]\nHe will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing-fork is in his\nhand\u2026 (Matt \uf646.\uf644\uf644\u2013\uf644\uf645)\n[B\uf644] I indeed baptize you with water; [A] but there comes one stronger than me,\nand I am not worthy to undo the strap of his sandals. [B\uf645] He will baptize you in\nthe Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing-fork is in his hand\u2026 (Luke \uf646.\uf644\uf649\u2013\uf644\uf64a)\nMatthew and Luke independently derive fromQ the transposition of [A] and [B\uf644],\nresulting in the division of the double baptism saying, and the addition of \u2018\u2026with\nfire\u2019, leading into the winnowing-fork saying (worded almost identically). Matthew\ndeviates further from Mark than does Luke, perhaps deriving from Q the reference\nto \u2018carrying\u2019 sandals rather than \u2018undoing\u2019 them. Yet the parallel redactional pro-\ncedures are again noteworthy. Both evangelists prefer the longer Q format, although\nLuke is also influenced by the Markan wording. Q, then, has provided both later\nevangelists with two judgment oracles, one general, the other announcing the\nComing One, and these are linked by the theme of \u2018fire\u2019 (Q \uf646.\uf64c, \uf644\uf649, \uf644\uf64a).\nWas there a Q account of Jesus\u2019 baptism, the event that follows in all three\nsynoptic evangelists (Mark \uf644.\uf64c\u2013\uf644\uf644; Matt \uf646.\uf644\uf646\u2013\uf644\uf64a; Luke \uf646.\uf645\uf644\u2013\uf645\uf645)?

The Critical Edition also repeatedly suggests that phraseology apparently drawn\nfrom Mark or from Matthean or Lukan redaction may actually reflect identical wording in Q.\nQ as Hypothesis \uf647\uf643\uf644\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 May 2010 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nsome such passage in order to bridge the gap between the Baptist\u2019s proclamation\nand the extended temptation narrative that follows (Q \uf647.\uf644\u2013\uf644\uf645). If so, Matthew and\nLuke independently prefer Mark to Q at this point. In the temptation narrative,\nhowever, they incorporate different elements from the brief Markan version\ninto the much fuller Q version, which completes this text\u2019s opening narrative\nsequence. Almost imperceptible in the introductory passage, Q provides the\nlater evangelists with the two judgment oracles, gives way to Mark\u2019s account of\nJesus\u2019 baptism and the descent of the Spirit and reappears in the extended temp-\ntation narrative. In spite of their differences, the later evangelists proceed in par-\nallel as they undertake their parallel tasks, which are to compose new accounts of\nthe beginning of Jesus\u2019 ministry on the basis of both Mark and Q.\nThe other equally striking parallelism is between Q and Mark. If these two texts\nare independent of each other, as Matthew and Luke are supposed to be, then both\nthe pairings that comprise the classic two-source hypothesis\u2014Mark and Q,\nMatthew and Luke\u2014give similar accounts of the beginnings of Jesus\u2019ministry, pro-\nceeding inmysterious harmony like the four living creatures in Ezekiel\u2019s vision. One\npossibility is simply to deny this opening narrative sequence to Q. A Q that begins\nwith the Inaugural Sermon (Q \uf649.\uf645\uf643\u2013\uf647\uf64c) is a more coherent text than one that sets\nout as a narrative gospel but diverts into sayings gospel mode. On that view, pas-\nsages such as the judgment oracle (Q \uf646.\uf64a\u2013\uf64c) and the temptation story (Q \uf647.\uf644\u2013\uf644\uf645)\nare independent fragments, not truly a part of Q.\uf644\uf646 In that case, however, the redac-\ntional parallelism is not just striking but astonishing. Quite independently of one\nanother, Matthew and Luke insert the same fragments at the same points in their\ncommon Markan framework. Alternatively, Mark may be dependent on Q, or Q\non Mark.\uf644\uf647 But if parallelism without dependence can exist on the second tier\n(Matthew and Luke), perhaps it can also exist on the first (Mark and Q).\nThe fact is that the Q hypothesis labours under a certain disadvantage in this\nopening narrative sequence. This is indirectly acknowledged by B. H. Streeter\nhimself. In response to \u2018the obvious suggestion that Luke knew Matthew\u2019s Gospel\u2019,\nStreeter claimed that, \u2018subsequent to the Temptation story, there is not a single\ncase in which Matthew and Luke agree in inserting the same saying at the same\npoint in the Marcan outline\u2019.\uf644\uf648 If that is the case only \u2018subsequent to the\nTemptation story\u2019, it is because the situation is quite different in the opening narrative\nsequence itself. Here, Matthew and Luke do agree in inserting the same sayings (the\ntwo judgment oracles) and the same narrative (the temptations) at the same points in\n\uf644\uf646 So Lindemann, for whom no coherent opening for Q can be extracted from Matt \uf646\u2013\uf647 = Luke\n\uf646\u2013\uf647; Q opened instead with the beatitudes (\u2018Die Logienquelle Q\u2019, \uf646\u2013\uf645\uf649).\n\uf644\uf647 See Jan Lambrecht \u2018John the Baptist and Jesus in Mark \uf644.\uf644\u2013\uf644\uf648: Markan Redaction of Q?\u2019, NTS\n\uf646\uf64b (\uf644\uf64c\uf64c\uf645) \uf646\uf648\uf64a\u2013\uf64b\uf647.\n\uf644\uf648 Streeter, The Four Gospels, \uf644\uf64b\uf646.\n\uf647\uf643\uf645 F RANC I S WATSON\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 May 2010 IP address: 129.234.252.66\ntheMarkan outline. It follows that, for thismaterial, \u2018the obvious suggestion that Luke\nknew Matthew\u2019s Gospel\u2019 must seem plausible, on Streeter\u2019s own premises.\nThe L\/M hypothesis seeks to account for a single rather than a double redac-\ntion, and has no need of the coincidental parallelism required by the Q hypothesis.\nIf Luke knew Matthew\u2019s Gospel, he would follow Matthew in the two judgment\noracles (while allowing Mark some influence over the wording of the second).\nHe would supplement Matthew with the exchanges between the Baptist and the\ncrowds, tax-collectors and soldiers (Luke \uf646.\uf644\uf643\u2013\uf644\uf647), just as Matthew had previously\nsupplemented Mark with the first judgment oracle. But he would omit the\nexchange between the Baptist and Jesus himself (Matt \uf646.\uf644\uf647\u2013\uf644\uf648). Why might he\nhave done so? If no plausible explanation lies to hand, does this suggest Luke\u2019s\nignorance of Matthew, as the Q hypothesis requires? But little if anything should\nbe read into an omission. The later evangelists often omit material from Mark,\nand speculating about their motives is rarely fruitful.\uf644\uf649\nGiven that Matthew and Luke otherwise agree here in their additions to Mark,\nStreeter\u2019s assumption must be that their disagreement elsewhere is such as to\noverride their agreement here. On the basis of this material alone, we would pos-\ntulate not Q but Luke\u2019s knowledge of Matthew. If Q represents the best expla-\nnation for the rest of the \u2018double tradition\u2019, however, it makes sense to extend\nthe hypothesis even into material that does not display the all-important disagree-\nment. Probably no-one will be satisfied with the suggestion that Luke followed\nMatthew in the opening narrative sequence, but Q thereafter.\nThe crucial question is whether the redactional parallelism generated here by\nthe Q hypothesis should be regarded as entirely conceivable or as highly unlikely.\uf644\uf64a\n\uf645. The Inaugural Sermon\nAccording to the Q hypothesis, Q moves rapidly on from the temptation\nnarrative to the Inaugural Sermon (Q \uf649.\uf645\uf643\u2013\uf647\uf64c). That is why, in Matthew, the\n\uf644\uf649 Perhaps Luke felt that the Baptist\u2019s initial reluctance to baptize Jesus was incompatible with\nthe predestined relationship between them, as portrayed in Luke \uf644? Or perhaps he failed to\nunderstand Jesus\u2019 cryptic reference to \u2018fulfilling all righteousness\u2019? Or perhaps the\nMatthean passage simply seemed superfluous to him? The possibilities could be multiplied.\n\uf644\uf64a Contrast David Catchpole\u2019s discussion of the opening narrative sequence, where the existence\nof Q is made to hang on the unlikelihood that Lukan wording is dependent on Matthean (The\nQuest for Q [Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark, \uf644\uf64c\uf64c\uf646] \uf64a\u2013\uf644\uf649). Why, for example, would Luke omit the\nMatthean 1\u1f30\u03c2 \u03bc1\u03c4\u1f71\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd from the double baptism saying, given that he introduces this\nvery phrase into his rendering of Mark \uf645.\uf644\uf64a in Luke \uf648.\uf646\uf645 (\uf644\uf643)? It is assumed here that a\nwriter who introduces a phrase into one context would be \u2018inconsistent\u2019 if he failed to repro-\nduce it in another, where it appears in one though not the other of his sources. But that is to\noperate with a mechanistic model of \u2018consistency\u2019. Ad hoc arguments of this kind do nothing\nto demonstrate the likelihood of Q, in the absence of an overarching reconstruction of the\nredational procedure entailed in the alternative hypotheses.\nQ as Hypothesis \uf647\uf643\uf646\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 May 2010 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nSermon occurs so early in Jesus\u2019ministry. The Sermon on theMount follows the Q\nSermon only in the outline it shares with Luke, and it is expanded with Q and non-\nQ material drawn in from elsewhere.

There seems no reason to doubt that a plausible\naccount of the Matthean redaction would come to light.\nIf Q is a hypothesis, however, requiring critical testing as such, it is not suffi-\ncient simply to describe the Matthean redaction as though Q were an extant docu-\nment. Any hypothesis must demonstrate its superiority over its rivals. In this case,\nthe hypothesis only exists at all on account of the alleged implausibility of its main\nrival, the L\/M hypothesis. On that view, the thirteen Q items inserted into the\nSermon on the Mount would have to be redescribed as items extracted from\nthe Sermon on the Mount by Luke, and reincorporated at later points in his\ngospel. It is at this point that the L\/M hypothesis is supposedly at its weakest.\nThus, W. G. K\u00fcmmel writes in an oft-quoted passage:\n[T]hat Lk took his common material over directly from Mt is championed\nagain and again. This position is completely inconceivable, however. What\ncould possibly have motivated Lk, for example, to shatter Mt\u2019s Sermon on\nthe Mount, placing part of it in his Sermon on the Plain, dividing up other\nparts among various chapters of his Gospel, and letting the rest drop out of\nsight?\uf644\uf64b\nThis familiar argument has perhaps done more than any other to establish a\nsense of the prima facie plausibility of Q. Yet it is seriously flawed.\nFirst, K\u00fcmmel assumes that a later evangelist would inevitably wish to repro-\nduce the Sermon on the Mount in his own work, in more or less its Matthean\nform. But Luke would not have known this material as \u2018the Sermon on the\nMount\u2019, and it is anachronistic to imagine that he would necessarily have\nshared the modern reverence for it. A later evangelist must reshape, omit or sup-\nplement source material if he is to produce a genuinely new gospel at all.\nSecond, K\u00fcmmel\u2019s question about \u2018motivation\u2019 is premature. In order to test\nthe Q hypothesis, we should first reconstruct the redactional procedure the evan-\ngelist would have to follow in redistributing parts of the Matthean Sermon to later\npoints in his own gospel. Once this hypothetical redactional procedure has been\nestablished, we may then raise the question of \u2018motivation\u2019, seeking a possible\nredactional logic within the new juxtapositions.\nOn the L\/M hypothesis, the five framework items and thirteen supplementary\nitems, listed above, take on a different significance. The framework items\u2014four\nbeatitudes; sayings on love of enemies, judging and fruitbearing; the parable of\nthe two houses\u2014now represent the Lukan reduction of the Matthean Sermon\nto around a third of its original compass. Some material Luke would simply\nomit: nowhere in Luke do we find an equivalent of the Matthean prohibition of\noath-taking (Matt \uf648.\uf646\uf646\u2013\uf646\uf64a). There is no need for the L\/M hypothesis to explain\n\uf644\uf64b K\u00fcmmel, Introduction to the New Testament, \uf649\uf647.\nQ as Hypothesis \uf647\uf643\uf648\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 May 2010 IP address: 129.234.252.66\n\u2018what could possibly have motivated Luke\u2019 to omit this prohibition, any more than\nthe Markan priority hypothesis is obliged to speculate about Luke\u2019s objections to\neverything in Mark \uf649.\uf647\uf647\u2013\uf64b.\uf645\uf649.

Also in E and F\uf645\/\uf646, traces of the original Matthean order\nare preserved.\nFurther analysis of the redactional procedure consequent on the L\/M hypoth-\nesis is unnecessary here, since our concern is primarily a methodological one.\nThis preliminary analysis confirms the Q hypothesis if and only if the redactional\nprocedure consequent on the L\/M hypothesis is held to be \u2018completely inconcei-\nvable\u2019. It supports the Q hypothesis if the thirteen items are more plausibly seen as\nsupplementing a short Sermon than as extracted from a long one. It undermines\nthe Q hypothesis if the L\/M redactional procedure is judged to be no less plausible\nthan the alternative. The issue is not resolved merely by observing that the\nSermon on the Mount appears to be a secondary construction put together by\nMatthew himself. Assuming that the evangelist made use of at least one source,\nthat source might or might not have been Q. As defined by the standard hypoth-\nesis, Q is not just a generic lost sayings source. It has its own particular contours.\uf645\uf644\n\uf645\uf644 It is true that, \u2018[i]f Luke were proved to have used Matthew, who in turn used Mark, the origin\nof the non-Marcan material in Matthew would still need clarification\u2019 (Catchpole, Quest for\nQ, \uf645). Yet, if one postulated a pre-Matthean sayings source on that basis, it would be utterly\nmisleading to call it \u2018Q\u2019.\nQ as Hypothesis \uf647\uf643\uf64a\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 May 2010 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nOne other way in which the issue might be resolved is by demonstrating what\nMark Goodacre has described as \u2018alternating primitivity\u2019:\uf645\uf645 that Matthew pre-\nserves the earlier form of a passage on some occasions, Luke on others. The\nearlier form would then be the Q form; the L\/M hypothesis is vulnerable if pas-\nsages can be identified in which the earlier form is clearly preserved in Luke.\nOne possible candidate occurs at the very outset of the Inaugural Sermon. In\nLuke, Jesus pronounces blessings on \u2018you poor\u2019 and \u2018you who hunger now\u2019\n(Luke \uf649.\uf645\uf643\u2013\uf645\uf644). In Matthew, he blesses \u2018the poor in spirit\u2019 and \u2018those who\nhunger and thirst for righteousness\u2019 (Matt \uf648.\uf646, \uf649). It is often said that Matthew\nhas here \u2018spiritualized\u2019 sayings that originally referred to material deprivation.\nWhile this is certainly possible, it is methodologically important to exclude the\nalternative possibility only when one has attempted and failed to make a case\nfor it. If Luke\u2019s beatitudes are constructed out of Matthew\u2019s, then the later evange-\nlist has reapplied beatitudes relating to ethical qualities to the material depri-\nvations endured by Jesus\u2019 disciples. By adding the woes, he has created a set of\nantitheses: poor\/rich, hungry\/satisfied, weeping\/laughing, hatred\/esteem (Luke\n\uf649.\uf645\uf643\u2013\uf645\uf649). Arguably, the first two antitheses fit remarkably well into a Gospel\nthat contains the Magnificat (cf. Luke \uf644.\uf648\uf645), the scriptural motif of good news\nfor the poor (Luke \uf647.\uf644\uf64b; \uf64a.\uf645\uf645) and the parables of the Rich Fool (\uf644\uf645.\uf644\uf649\u2013\uf645\uf644) and\nDives and Lazarus (\uf644\uf649.\uf644\uf64c\u2013\uf646\uf644).\uf645\uf646 If so, there is no need to trace the beatitudes in\ntheir shorter form back to Q. If Matthew\u2019s beatitudes are secondary then Luke\u2019s\nmay be primary, but they may equally well be tertiary.\uf645\uf647\n\uf646. The Common Sequence\nThe chapters following Matthew\u2019s Sermon on the Mount contain a sig-\nnificant quantity of Q material interspersed within Markan material in which\nthe original Markan sequence is not easy to detect. Indeed, it is the free handling\nof Markan sequence especially in Matthew \uf64b\u2013\uf64c that has led to the view that Luke\n\uf645\uf645 Goodacre, Case against Q, \uf649\uf644.\n\uf645\uf646 See the detailed discussion of this point in Goodacre, Case against Q, \uf644\uf646\uf646\u2013\uf648\uf644.\n\uf645\uf647 The pressure to identify one version of a saying as \u2018more primitive\u2019 than another reflects the\nassumption that the favoured version may approximate to the very words Jesus uttered. For a\ntheoretically sophisticated critique of this view of \u2018authenticity\u2019, see Jens Schr\u00f6ter, \u2018Die Frage\nnach dem historischen Jesus und der Charakter historischer Erkenntnis\u2019, Sayings Source Q (ed.\nA Lindemann) \uf645\uf643\uf64a\u2013\uf648\uf647.

In Matthew \uf64b\u2013\uf644\uf646, three interlocking sequences may be ident-\nified.

It occurs on account of Matthew\u2019s\ndecision to place the healing of the leper on the road that leads from the mountain\nto Capernaum, where the centurion\u2019s servant and Peter\u2019s mother-in-law are\nhealed. It is therefore incorrect to assume that Matthew \uf64b\u2013\uf64c in particular is\nbased on some non-Markan principle of organization.\uf645\uf64a Although the Beelzebul\ncontroversy story is said to have occurred in Q as well as Mark, it should be\nnoted that it occurs here at the appropriate position within the primary Markan\nsequence.\nInterspersed within the two overlapping Markan sequences is a further\nsequence consisting of ten items that Matthew shares with Luke.

In the\nfollowing analysis, an asterisk indicates a difference from the Matthean order.\n\uf645\uf64a According to Davies and Allison, in Matt \uf64b\u2013\uf64c the evangelist has reorganized the Markan\nsequence to create three groups of three miracles stories concluding with a summary and\nwords of Jesus (Matthew, \uf644.\uf649\uf64a, \uf644\uf643\uf645; \uf645.\uf644\u2013\uf648 [Excursus V]).

The analysis is greatly simplified once it is\nseen that Matthew here follows two distinct Markan sequences. The double sequence is\nnoted by F.

In both\nlater gospels, this entire common sequence has been superimposed on the\nMarkan one, and around \uf647\uf643% of the \u2018double tradition\u2019 material occurs within it.\nThis is to be differentiated from the remaining \uf649\uf643% of this material which is dif-\nferently distributed: in Matthew, primarily in the great discourses (Matt \uf648\u2013\uf64a; \uf644\uf643,\n\uf644\uf64b; \uf645\uf646\u2013\uf645\uf648); in Luke, primarily in \uf644\uf644.\uf646\uf646\u2013\uf644\uf64a.\uf646\uf64a, starting from the very point at\nwhich the common sequence ends. In both Matthew and Luke, the common\nsequence is partially concealed by material derived from Mark or unique to one\nor other evangelist. It comes to light only when this extraneous material is set\naside.\uf645\uf64b\nSecond, the earlier position of iv Jesus and John in Luke connects this passage\nmore closely with the Baptist material that introduces Jesus\u2019 own ministry (Luke\n\uf646.\uf644\u2013\uf645\uf645 and parallels). Since the sequence here concludes with viii Sign of Jonah,\nthe sequel to vii {Beelzebul controversy} is now, appropriately enough, ix Return of\nunclean spirit. In Matthew, the equivalent sequel is provided by the passage on\nfruitbearing (Matt \uf644\uf645.\uf646\uf646\u2013\uf646\uf64a), which this evangelist connects to the twin sayings\non blasphemy against the Spirit that conclude his account of the Beelzebul con-\ntroversy. However they are to be explained, these divergences do not seriously\nundermine the common non-Markan sequence.\n\uf645\uf64b Kloppenborg also notes this common sequence, but adds further items to it\u2014the parable of\nthe lost sheep, sayings on forgiveness, the parable of the talents (Formation of Q, \uf64a\uf646). The\neffect is to obscure the sharp divide in Luke between common sequence material (Luke\n\uf646.\uf644\u2013\uf644\uf644.\uf646\uf645 =Matt \uf646.\uf644\u2013\uf644\uf645.\uf648\uf643) and non-sequential common material (Luke \uf644\uf644.\uf646\uf645\u2013\uf644\uf64a.\uf646\uf64a =Matt\npassim; exceptions at Luke \uf649.\uf646\uf64c\u2013\uf647\uf643; \uf644\uf644.\uf645\u2013\uf647, \uf64c\u2013\uf644\uf646).\nQ as Hypothesis \uf647\uf644\uf644\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 May 2010 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nThird, after the opening narrative sequence Luke incorporates items from the\ncommon sequence in just two major groupings, and these items all occur at a later\npoint relative to Mark than in Matthew. While some grouping occurs in Matthew,\ncommon sequence items are more widely dispersed through the evangelist\u2019s\noverlapping Markan sequences; and all have been incorporated by the point at\nwhich Matthew reaches Mark\u2019s parable chapter (Matt \uf644\uf646 =Mark \uf647). In contrast,\nonly two of the ten common sequence items have been incorporated at the equiv-\nalent point in Luke (Luke \uf64b.\uf647\u2013\uf644\uf64b). As a result of Luke\u2019s grouping of common\nsequence material, the Markan sequence stands out more clearly in Luke than\nin Matthew, even though it is equally fundamental to both evangelists. Matthew\nseeks to conflate his Markan and non-Markan sequences, whereas Luke seeks\nto preserve their individual integrity. The later positioning of the non-Markan\nmaterial relative to the Markan indicates that Luke gives a certain priority to Mark.\nFourth, Luke\u2019s version of vii {Beelzebul controversy} is anomalous. In Matthew\nthis controversy story occurs within the primary Markan sequence. As with the\nother Markan controversy stories in Matthew \uf644\uf645, the later evangelist inserts sup-\nplementary material here, in the form of a new introduction (\uf644\uf645.\uf645\uf645\u2013\uf645\uf646) and\nsayings relating to the source of exorcistic power (\uf644\uf645.\uf645\uf64a\u2013\uf645\uf64b), being for or\nagainst Jesus (\uf644\uf645.\uf646\uf643) and defaming the Son of man and the Holy Spirit\n(\uf644\uf645.\uf646\uf645).\uf645\uf64c Luke attests the first three of these four expansions, and he places\nthis story not in the appropriate location in his Markan sequence (that is, at\nLuke \uf64b.\uf647) but within the sequence shared with Matthew. Thus, this controversy\nstory belongs both within Matthew\u2019s rendering of the primary Markan sequence,\nand within the non-Markan sequence Matthew shares with Luke.\nFifth, a related anomaly arises from Luke\u2019s version of x {Jesus\u2019 true family}.\nHere, Jesus blesses \u2018those who hear the word of God and keep it\u2019, in response\nto a woman in the crowd who pronounces a blessing on his mother (\uf644\uf644.\uf645\uf64a\u2013\uf645\uf64b).\nThis recalls the Markan passage on Jesus\u2019 true family (Mark \uf646.\uf646\uf644\u2013\uf646\uf648), which\nLuke has already reproduced (Luke \uf64b.\uf644\uf64c\u2013\uf645\uf644). Thus Luke includes two passages\non this theme, and they are similar enough to comprise a \u2018doublet\u2019. In both pas-\nsages, Jesus\u2019 saying is provoked by a reference to his mother (with or without his\nbrothers), and in both he responds by commending instead those who hear and\nobey the word of God. In Matthew, x {Jesus\u2019 true family} occurs in a Markan form\nand within the primary Markan sequence. Yet Matthew and Luke have both\nattached a form of the true family passage to ix Return of unclean spirit. Like vii\n\uf645\uf64c In the same way, Matthew supplements the Markan sabbath controversy stories with sayings\nrelating to the temple (Matt \uf644\uf645.\uf648\u2013\uf64a), and with the analogy of the sheep falling into a pit (Matt\n\uf644\uf645.\uf644\uf644\u2013\uf644\uf645). Matt \uf644\uf645.\uf645\uf64a, \uf645\uf64b are closely connected to one another and to the context, as is indi-\ncated by the sequence \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7 \u039211\u03b61\u03b2\u03bf\u1f7b\u03bb (v. \uf645\uf647), \u1f10\u03bd \u039211\u03b61\u03b2\u03bf\u1f7b\u03bb, \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1f77\u03bd\u03b9 (v. \uf645\uf64a), \u1f10\u03bd \u03c0\u03bd1\u1f7b\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\n\u03b81\u03bf\u1fe6 (v. \uf645\uf64b). Matt \uf644\uf645.\uf646\uf643, \uf646\uf645 are both variants of Markan sayings.\n\uf647\uf644\uf645 F RANC I S WATSON\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 May 2010 IP address: 129.234.252.66\n{Beelzebul controversy}, this passage exists simultaneously within a Markan\nsequence (evidenced in Matthew) and a non-Markan one (evidenced in Luke).\nThis analysis of the sequence common to Matthew and Luke can now be used\nto test the L\/M and Q hypotheses. The question to be put to each is this: What kind\nof redactional procedure would produce this common sequence, differently dis-\ntributed and partially concealed by Markan and other material?\nOn the L\/M hypothesis, the common sequence is the result of Luke\u2019s distinc-\ntive engagement with Matthew. The hypothesis requires Luke to be able to ident-\nify non-Markan material in Matthew, but to do so only after he has given his own\nrendering of the Markan context in which Matthew has located it, on the basis of\nMark\u2019s narrative alone.\uf646\uf643 Luke first rewrites a Markan sequence, and then incor-\nporates selected supplementary material from Matthew. After the opening narra-\ntive sequence, the third evangelist engages with each of the two earlier gospels in\nturn, alternating between them.\uf646\uf644 Given a redactional decision to differentiate\nMarkan and Matthean material and to give precedence to Mark, it is unsurprising\nthat relatively few traces of Matthew\u2019s redaction of Mark are evident in the equiv-\nalent Lukan redaction. Luke departs from his usual editorial practice, however, in\nthe case of vii {Beelzebul controversy} and x {Jesus\u2019 true family}. In the one case, he\nhas followed Matthew rather than Mark, as both the positioning and the\nadditional sayings indicate. In the other case, he has followed Matthew as well\nas Mark, reworking the Markan version within his Markan sequence (Luke\n\uf64b.\uf644\uf64c\u2013\uf645\uf644) and the Matthean version (itself dependent on Mark) within the\ncommon sequence derived from Matthew (Luke \uf644\uf644.\uf645\uf64a\u2013\uf645\uf64b).\nOn the Q hypothesis, the non-Markan sequence common to Matthew and\nLuke is derived from Q, rather than being a Lukan construct derived from\nMatthew\u2019s supplementation of Mark. Working independently but in parallel, the\nlater evangelists find different ways to accommodate the Q sequence within the\nMarkan one. Luke\u2019s consistent grouping of items from Q may preserve their orig-\ninal connections. vii {Beelzebul controversy} and x {Jesus\u2019 true family} create some\ncomplications, however. It is evident from Matthew that these passages belong to\nthe evangelist\u2019s primary Markan sequence, and it is evident from Luke that they\nalso belong to the common sequence derived from Q. So we must envisage two\nindependent sequences, one from Mark, the other from Q, in both of which an\naccount of the Beelzebul controversy is followed\u2014immediately in Mark, after\n\uf646\uf643 It is therefore not a problem for the L\/M hypothesis that \u2018there is no sign in Luke of the major\naddition Matthew makes to Mark at \uf644\uf649:\uf644\uf649\u2013\uf644\uf64c\u2019 (Graham Stanton, The Four Gospels and Jesus\n[Oxford: Oxford University, \uf644\uf64c\uf64b\uf64c] \uf64b\uf64b). Luke incorporates many Matthean additions to Mark\nbut not all (e.g. Matt \uf644\uf645.\uf644\uf644\u2013\uf644\uf645 = Luke \uf644\uf647.\uf648; Matt \uf644\uf649.\uf645\u2013\uf646 = Luke \uf644\uf645.\uf648\uf647\u2013\uf648\uf649; Matt \uf644\uf64a.\uf644\uf64c\u2013\uf645\uf643 =\nLuke \uf644\uf64a.\uf648\u2013\uf649).\n\uf646\uf644 Against Kloppenborg, the L\/M hypothesis does not find it \u2018difficult to account for the fact that\nLuke\u2019s placement of the double tradition differs almost entirely from that of Matthew\u2019\n(Excavating Q, \uf646\uf643). Once this placement is adequately investigated, its logic is straightforward.\nQ as Hypothesis \uf647\uf644\uf646\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 May 2010 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nintervening material in Q\u2014by an incident in which a reference to Jesus\u2019mother or\nfamily provokes him to utter a saying commending those who observe the will or\nword of God. Since Matthew reproduces the Mark version here, the Lukan version\nof x {Jesus\u2019 true family} probably derives from Q.\uf646\uf645\nThus Matthew has at his disposal two otherwise different sequences, derived\nfrom Mark and Q, which coincide at two points. These points occur late in the Q\nsequence, early in the Markan one, and the evangelist uses them to create a junc-\nture at which the two sequences merge into one. That is why Matthew\u2019s Q\nmaterial has to occur so early in relation to Mark. The construction of Matthew\n\uf646\u2013\uf644\uf645 in its entirety is shaped by the decision that the two sequences should\nmeet and merge at their otherwise inconspicuous points of coincidence. This\nredactional decision is, however, the product of the Q hypothesis itself.\nMatthew expands Mark\u2019s account of the Beelzebul controversy, as he expands\nother Markan controversy stories, but there is little in the Matthean text itself to\nsuggest that the evangelist has at his disposal a second version of the entire\nstory.\uf646\uf646 The hypothetical Q version of the story is the product of Luke\u2019s unusual\nproximity here to Matthew rather than Mark, interpreted on the assumption\nthat Luke cannot be dependent on Matthew. The proximity is such that, if one\nevangelist cannot be dependent on the other, a common source is the only\noption. But it remains a challenge for the Q hypothesis to show why its own con-\nsequent redactional procedure is more plausible than the straightforward one\nentailed in the L\/M hypothesis. The claim that the L\/M hypothesis must attribute\nto Luke a patently incredible redactional procedure has turned out to be prema-\nture, to say the least.\nIt is not my concern here to adjudicate between the Q and L\/M hypotheses.\nThe aim is methodological: to show the importance of systematic attention to\nthe redactional procedures entailed in competing source-critical hypotheses. In\nthe case of Q, refutation of the L\/M hypothesis is a prerequisite, and a full analysis\nof the redactional procedure consequent upon both hypotheses is therefore indis-\npensable for the critical assessment of Q itself. Anyone concerned to verify Q,\n\uf646\uf645 This is acknowledged as a possibility in Critical Edition, \uf645\uf647\uf647. If Luke \uf644\uf644.\uf645\uf64a\u2013\uf645\uf64b is not drawn\nfrom Q, independent redaction has coincidentally attached parallel passages from different\nsources to ix Return of unclean spirit (Q).\n\uf646\uf646 The existence of a \u2018doublet\u2019 (Matt \uf64c.\uf646\uf645\u2013\uf646\uf647 = \uf644\uf645.\uf645\uf645\u2013\uf645\uf647) might be taken as an indication that the\nevangelist draws on a non-Markan as well as a Markan version of this story. Matt \uf64c.\uf646\uf645\u2013\uf646\uf647 falls\noutside both the Markan and the Q sequences; on the other hand, it corresponds closely to the\nopening of Luke\u2019s (single) version of the story (Luke \uf644\uf644.\uf644\uf647\u2013\uf644\uf649), and could therefore derive\nfrom Q. The majority of Matthew\u2019s doublets do not easily fit the \u2018two source\u2019 model,\nhowever, and the duplication is often the work of the evangelist himself. See the examples\nassembled in Sir John Hawkins, Horae Synopticae (Oxford: Oxford University, \uf645nd ed. \uf644\uf64c\uf643\uf64c)\n\uf64b\uf645\u2013\uf64c\uf64c.\n\uf647\uf644\uf647 F RANC I S WATSON\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 May 2010 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nrather than merely assuming it on the basis of traditional ad hoc arguments, must\nengage seriously with the major alternative.\uf646\uf647\nOnce an overview of the relevant redactional procedures has been achieved, it\nmay then be possible to identify decisive points that tell against one hypothesis\nand in favour of another. Some potential candidates for this role may have\ncome to light in the course of this study. Yet the moral of the story of Q research\nis that supposedly decisive points have been too readily accepted as such, passing\ninto wider circulation without consideration of the wider framework within which\nthey must be either verified or falsified. That is a pitfall to be avoided, whether in\nreaffirming Q or in dispensing with it.\n\uf646\uf647 Neglect of this methodological point may be traced back to the very roots of the Q hypothesis.\nQ in its modern form originated in Weisse\u2019s extension to Luke of Schleiermacher\u2019s logia\nsource, which had been derived exclusively from Matthew (F. D. E. Schleiermacher, \u2018Ueber\ndie Zeugnisse des Papias von unsern beiden ersten Evangelien\u2019, ThStKr [\uf644\uf64b\uf646\uf645] \uf64a\uf646\uf648\u2013\uf649\uf64b;\nChristian Hermann Weisse, Die evangelische Geschichte kritisch und philosophisch bearbeitet\n[\uf645 vols.; Leipzig: Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel, \uf644\uf64b\uf646\uf64b] \uf644.\uf64b\uf647). Weisse makes the simple observation that\nmuch of the material in Schleiermacher\u2019s logia recurs in Luke, who is therefore dependent\non the same source as Matthew (\uf644.\uf64b\uf647). What is at issue is therefore not the existence of the\nsource (which Weisse like Schleiermacher believes is attested by Papias), but rather its\nscope. Support for the claim that two earlier sources underlie both Matthew and Luke is\nfound in the \u2018doublets\u2019 in both (\uf644.\uf64b\uf645\u2013\uf646). Thus Weisse is led to the conclusion that \u2018[n]icht\nnur Marcus ist beiden gemeinschaftliche Quelle, sondern, unserer bestimmtesten\nUeberzeugung nach, auch die Spruchsammlung des Matth\u00e4us\u2019 (\uf644.\uf64b\uf646). It is taken for granted\nthat Luke is \u2018v\u00f6llig unabh\u00e4ngig\u2019 of Matthew (\uf644.\uf648\uf649), and the importance of demonstrating\nthis independence is overlooked.\nQ as Hypothesis \uf647\uf644\uf648\n"}
