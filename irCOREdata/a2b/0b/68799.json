Such\nadvances are very much technology driven, and early\nresearch into 3-D integration has now crystallised into\ncommercially viable options that are being pursued by\nmany companies. Being able to position memory in closer\nproximity to processing elements in a NoC architecture as\nafforded by a 3-D physical architecture has the potential\nto improve the memory bandwidth and mitigate the gen-\neral nature of delay constrained performance in IC\ndesign. Understanding the nature of the opportunities and\nconstraints provided in such a 3-D physical architecture is\ncrucial in realising the true benefits of 3-D integration in\nfuture applications.\n1. Introduction\nDevice integration on a single die has kept broadly to\nthe Moore predicted rate over the past four decades due to\nconcerted industry efforts, and this trend is set to continue\nin the near future, with the DRAM 1\/2 pitch being set a\ntarget of 18-20nm in 2018 by the ITRS [1]. For true sys-\ntem-level integration of heterogeneous elements including\nspecialised and general purpose digital processing blocks,\nanalogue, mixed-signal and RF functions and storage, the\nIC industry has increasingly been looking at 3-D integra-\ntion. Multi-chip module type arrangements where pack-\naged chips are situated on a single substrate or across a\nboard and package-level integration options such as Sys-\ntem-In-Package where stacked dies are connected by bond\nwires have been augmented by technologies capable of\ndie-to-die and die-to-wafer integration using through-Si-\nvias (TSV) (see Fig. 1). These different options generally\nprovide a trade-off between cost, performance, functional-\nity and footprint [2].\nThe generalised NoC architecture has been proposed as\nbeing suitable for integrating heterogeneous elements and\nmanaging the communication between them efficiently.\nSophisticated system-level analyses identify a memory-\nrelated bottleneck for high-throughput, demanding appli-\ncations such as multi-media applications. A 3-D stacked\nmemory system provides an interesting storage option for\na general purpose NoC, potentially easing the memory\nbottleneck.\n2. Memory Integration Technology\nThe main potential benefits of 3-D integration include\nreduced overall footprint, and reduction of overall wiring\nlength for a given system configuration, with the associ-\nated improvements in propagation delay and energy per\n1a: System-In-Package \n(Die-stacking using \n1b: Wafer-level \n with die stacking\nFigure 1. 3-D Integration Options (from [2])\nwire bonds)\nintegration\nMemory Technology for Extended Large-Scale Integration in Future \nElectronics Applications\nDinesh Pamunuwa\nCentre for Microsystems Engineering\nDepartment of Engineering\nLancaster University, Lancaster, UK\nd.pamunuwa@lancaster.ac.uk\n978-3-9810801-3-1\/DATE08 \u00a9 2008 EDAA \n \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

It also allows disparate\ntechnologies to be integrated, which for a general purpose\nNoC can mean the chip-level integration of DRAM and\nFLASH with CMOS logic. The reduced parasitics for\ninterconnects can further significantly simplify the circuit\nand power distribution network design for high perform-\nance applications.\nIn particular, massive amounts of inexpensive storage\ncurrently supplied by Magnetic Hard Disks can potentially\nbe supplied by flash memory located within the same chip,\neliminating the multiple communication hierarchies from\nthe chip to off-chip caches to board-level traces to cables\nand back. This can potentially improve the raw data band-\nwidth by several orders of magnitude. Using this improve-\nment to gain a true improvement in system-level\nfunctionality discernible by the end user will require a\nshift from the traditional architecture with multiple hierar-\nchical caches.\n3. Challenges in 3-D Integration\nReliability of such a system is a concern, since flash\ncells have an activity depended life-span, being subject to\na higher voltage stress during the programming phase, and\nalso during reading, for multi-level cells [5]. Wear-level-\nling algorithms which spread the load evenly across cells,\nerror-correction and redundancy to account for manufac-\nturing variances are common in Flash memories, but may\nneed to be augmented with innovative techniques.\nThe main obstacle to 3-D integration is poor thermal\nconductivity and heat dissipation and the resultant temper-\nature rise due to the high power density [6]. Thermal vias\ncan alleviate this problem, but again innovative techniques\nare called for, such as micro-channel cooling [7] and\ndynamic activity management with built-in sensors and\nsensing functions to monitor the operating temperature.\nA major consideration in 3-D integration is the fabrica-\ntion cost. Yield is very sensitive to chip stacking, and can\ndecrease exponentially with no. of layers in wafer-to-\nwafer integration. This is because even if the wafers indi-\nvidually have acceptable yield, when combined in a verti-\ncal stack, the probability of a good die on one layer\ncombining with a bad one on another layer is high.\nMechanical stress during the assembly process, and com-\nbined mechanical and thermal stress can cause failures as\nwell as parametric shifts. Testing is significantly more\ncomplicated, and the turn-around time is higher. However,\nthese issues are currently being heavily researched, and\nintegrated test functions and an inexpensive test-insert to\nsit in-between dies in the stack may be one solution [8].\n4. Improvements in Performance\nThree principal operations of a digital system can be\nidentified: the binary switching transfer, communication\nof a bit and storage of a bit. Each of these operations can\nbe characterised by a metric, such as gate delay for the\nbinary switching transfer or interconnect latency for com-\nmunication. High-level performance metrics such as\nMIPS, bandwidth and throughput can be calculated from\nthese metrics. By considering limitations imposed on each\nof these operations from physical considerations at differ-\nent hierarchical levels, ranging from the fundamental to\nthe system level, an exploration space for performance can\nbe defined. The key metrics relating to each of these oper-\nations for the 3-D stacked memory system will identify its\nlocation within the performance space, and highlight the\npossibility of potential improvements.\nSuch an analysis can be used to identify future opportu-\nnities for NoC based systems in demanding applications.\n5.
