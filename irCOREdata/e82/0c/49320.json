Introduction\nThe issue of the determinants of medical student dropout probabilities is important and\ntopical in both the UK and beyond for a variety of reasons. First, there is serious and growing\nconcern in the UK and elsewhere1 regarding a shortage in the domestic supply of medical\ndoctors. As we describe in more detail below, this has led to Government-supported enquiries\ninto the causes and potential cures for this problem. The most obvious policy initiative is to\ntrain more doctors. But an expansion of medical student numbers begs questions regarding\nboth student quality and student retention. This paper attempts to inform our understanding of\nthe latter issue.\nA second reason for examining medical student dropout behaviour relates to the UK\ndebate on the desirability of \u2018widening\u2019 access into higher education, in general, and into\nmedical schools in particular. There has been a lively and high-profile debate in the UK\nconcerning the extent of accessibility of medical schools to students regardless of their social\nor school background (see McManus (1998) and the related discussion). This has led to\nexplicit recommendations to broaden access to undergraduate medical education (see Angel\nand Johnson, 2000). Predicting the likely impact of such policies on retention and progression\nis clearly an important issue. A third reason for analysing medical student withdrawal\nconcerns the related debate concerning the extent to which previous educational\nqualifications affect medical student performance and progression (see, for example,\nMcManus et al., 1999). An issue here concerns whether it should be compulsory for medical\nstudents to have studied science subjects prior to enrolment.\n                                                \n1 The Third Report of the UK\u2019s Medical Workforce Standing Advisory Committee (1997) cites indications that\nthere will be a deficit of doctors in Europe early in this century (MWSAC, 1997. p. 30).\n2Finally, we note that the UK Government has recently introduced a series of\nPerformance Indicators for Higher Education Institutions in the UK, including an indicator\nthat ranks institutions on the basis of completion rates.2 Other European countries are\nfollowing the UK government\u2019s lead in the publication of official university league tables.\nWe argue that the interpretation of league tables based on completion rates should be carried\nout against the backdrop of an understanding of which factors influence dropout rates.\nFurthermore, it is important to assess the statistical significance of rankings represented in\nsuch league tables. We offer some discussion of these issues in the current paper.\nThe rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents a discussion of the\ninstitutional and policy contexts, which provide the backdrop to our analysis of data on UK\nmedical students. Section 3 describes the data set and Section 4 describes the econometric\nmodel along with a discussion of relevant issues regarding our model estimation procedure.\nEstimates of the determinants of dropout probabilities are presented in Section 5. Some\ndiscussion on predicted dropout probabilities from our preferred model is presented in\nSection 6. Finally, Section 7 closes the paper with conclusions and further remarks.\n2. Institutional context and public policy\nLabour economics focuses chiefly on the analysis of decentralised labour markets in which\nequilibrium outcomes emerge from the interplay of the forces of supply and demand, where\nthese forces are governed significantly by the price of labour. In important respects, however,\nthe labour market for medical practitioners in the UK is better described by a planning model\nthan by a model of a purely decentralised free market. Primarily, this is because of the nature\nof the necessary regulation in the market. In the UK, doctors are trained within medical\n                                                \n2 For a discussion of performance indicators based on graduate employment outcomes, see Smith, Naylor and\nMcKnight (2000).\n3schools funded and regulated by the government. In large part, this arrangement follows from\nthe still predominantly public nature of medical provision under the auspices of the National\nHealth Service. Currently in the UK, as in many other countries, there are major concerns\nregarding a growing shortage of medical doctors. The UK solution to this problem is\nperceived as requiring more efficient planning of the medical workforce.3 The Third Report\nof the Medical Workforce Standing Advisory Committee (MWSAC, 1997) to the Secretary\nof State for Health bears testimony to this reliance on a planning approach and also makes\nplain how such an approach \u2013 to be effective and efficient \u2013 demands a wealth of detailed\ndata and appropriate accompanying analysis. In part, the nature of this information\nrequirement is a consequence of the lengthy training period and the consequent time lags\nbetween forecasting future supply and demand and the subsequent \u2018production\u2019 of the\nmedical workforce. Uncertainties in demographic trends \u2013 which are themselves\nendogenously determined with the nature and level of medical provision \u2013 and in the\nevolution of medical technologies themselves compound the difficulties associated with\nforecasting and planning.\nThe Third Report of the MWSAC proposed a number of measures to prevent what it\ndescribes as \u2018the current significant imbalance\u2019 between demand and the domestic supply of\ndoctors from becoming \u2018increasingly severe\u2019. A main conclusion of the Report was that there\nshould be a substantial increase in medical student intake (about 1,000 per annum,\napproximately 20% of the current intake), together with policies to ensure \u2018minimised levels\nof wastage from such courses, thereby increasing the proportion of entrants that qualify as\ndoctors.\u2019 Of course, a significant incentive to reduce wastage rates lies in the high cost\n                                                \n3 This is a very different approach from that recently recommended from an analysis of the shortage of\npostgraduate students of Economics in the UK (see Machin and Oswald, 2000). In that case, the problem was\nattributed largely to a distortion in the relative price of labour.\n4associated with medical training. There is no concensus figure on the full cost of a medical\ntraining \u2013 partly because the costs vary across institutions and are borne by a variety of\nparties \u2013 but a figure of around \u00a350,000 per annum, is often quoted. One element of the\nproposed package of measures to address the issue of minimising wastage concerns changes\nin selection procedures of candidates for medical schools in order to \u2018obtain graduates with a\nwider range of skills and interests.\u2019 The related issue of selection and admission of students\ninto medical schools in the UK has itself been the recent focus of significant debate.\nAs the MWSAC report has emphasised, the development of strategies to minimise the\nmedical student dropout rate should be conducted in the light of analysis of the determinants\nof completion and withdrawal behaviour by medical students. This has been rendered\ndifficult in the UK by a lack of reliable data and analysis. The MWSAC Report\nacknowledges that there is significant uncertainty regarding estimates of medical school\nqualification rates. Estimates are typically based on the difference between annual intake of\nstudents at each medical school and the number qualifying 5 years later. This is imprecise\npartly because of variations over time and across institutions in the number of students taking\nintercalated degrees, for example, and hence taking longer to qualify. Thus, it is not\nsurprising that there is so much variation in the estimated drop-out rates, which fluctuated\n(with no systematic trend) between 8% and 14% during the period 1986\/7 and 1991\/2 (see\nMWSAC, 3rd Report, p. 65). So severe is the information problem regarding the drop-out rate\nthat the Third Report of the MWSAC acknowledges that all its analysis and\nrecommendations rest on an estimated student wastage rate which is itself based on \u2018some\nanecdotal evidence that drop out is falling\u2019 (p. 25). One of the eight recommendations of the\nReport called for more information and research into medical school wastage rates, inter alia.\nIn the absence of reliable data on medical school dropout rates, different studies have\nproduced widely varying estimates of the average national rate. Parkhouse (1996) uses\n5University Statistical Record (USR) and Higher Education Funding Council (HEFCE) data\non medical school intake and numbers qualifying five years later and estimates an average\nUK drop-out rate of between 11.7% and 14.1%. McManus (1996) disputes these figures and\ncites survey evidence that the rate is around 7% or 8%, with about half of the students who\ndrop out doing so for non-academic reasons.\nPrevious data and accompanying analysis have been based, typically, either on\naggregated (medical school-level) official data from the USR or HEFCE or on follow-up\nsurveys of particular sub-samples of medical students. This mirrors the situation regarding\nthe analysis of all UK university students across all subject areas. Johnes and Taylor (1990),\nfor example, model student withdrawal rates using university-level data.4\nVery recently, however, (anonymised) individual student-level administrative data for\nfull population cohorts of students have become available to researchers for the period 1972-\n1993. These data contain rich information not only on the academic characteristics of\nstudents in UK universities (their courses, institutional affiliation, performance, reasons for\nleaving, accommodation, inter alia) but also on their personal, social, and prior educational\ncharacteristics. These data offer the prospect of much more precise estimates of dropout rates\nand of detailed analytical investigation of the factors associated with dropout behaviour. This\nis of clear interest and relevance to the issue of examining the impact of changing selection\nprocedures on medical students\u2019 dropout probabilities (see, for example, Angel and Johnson,\n2000).5 Given the public policy importance of the issue, in the current paper we focus\nexclusively on a detailed analysis of the determinants of the withdrawal probability of UK\nmedical students.\n                                                \n4 Amongst other phenomena such as degree performance and labour market outcomes.\n5 Smith and Naylor (2001b) use individual-level data to examine the student dropout rate across all UK\nuniversity students, on three or four year degrees (which excludes medical students).\n63. The Data\nAll higher education institutions \u2013 including all medical schools \u2013 in the UK are required\nannually to deposit comprehensive longitudinal individual student records data with a central\ngovernment agency. Our data-set is based on these administrative data from the anonymised\nindividual Universities Student Records (USR) for the full populations of undergraduate\nstudents leaving university in the UK in one of the academic years 1985-1993. The full\ndataset contains information on about 720,000 students \u2013 about 90,000 per cohort \u2013 across the\nfull range of university degree courses. From information on each of these \u2018leaving cohorts\u2019,\nwe have generated a data-set comprising all those full-time students who entered university at\nthe start of the academic year 1985 or 1986 to study for a medical degree and who had either\ncompleted their course by the end of July 1993, or had left their medical degree program\nprior to completion.\nThe reason for the choice of starting years 1985 and 1986 is based on data\nconsiderations. Data availability restricts us to cohorts leaving university no later than 1993.\nIn general, a medical degree in the UK takes five years to complete and the analysis is\ntherefore conducted on students who enrolled for a five-year degree program. Normally, the\nfirst two years are classified as pre-clinical and the latter three as clinical parts of the degree.\nAt the end of the second year of the program, those who perform well are given the\nopportunity to take an extra year in order to complete a Bachelor of Science degree before\ncontinuing with their medical degree. If they are successful, these students will then have\ntaken a minimum of six years to complete their original degree. Students are also allowed to\nretake any failed examinations during their course of studies. In order to proceed to the next\nyear of the degree program, the student is required to pass the examinations (either at the first\nattempt or after re-sits). Students who completed their medical degree program in 1993 after\n5 years of study would have first enrolled in 1988. However, if we study only these students,\n7we will fail to observe students taking more than 5 years to complete. For this reason, we\nprefer to consider students who enrolled no later than 1986 as this gives us a minimum of 7\nyears over which to observe their withdrawal or completion. In order to increase the size of\nour dataset, we also include the 1985 starting cohort. The two cohorts will have faced very\nsimilar labour market and related conditions. This becomes less true if we take additional\nearlier cohorts.\nIn the event of non-completion, an administrative leaving date is recorded along with\na university-recorded reason for the student\u2019s withdrawal.  From this information, we find\nthat degree course transfers account for around 26% of all withdrawals, with academic\nreasons accounting for 36% and other reasons accounting for 32%.  This breakdown appears\nto conflict with that suggested by McManus (1996); however, for a number of reasons, we\nare not satisfied that the administrative coding of date and reason for leaving are reliable. For\nexample, it is very likely that the first indication that a student has withdrawn will be their\nabsence from examinations or their failure to submit other work. It is not clear whether this is\n\u2013 or should be \u2013 coded as academic failure, and in any case practice may vary across\ninstitutions.  Accordingly, we have not used the actual administrative leaving date and the\nreason for the withdrawal in our analyses.\nIn this paper, an individual is assumed to have successfully completed if s\/he obtains\na medical degree by the end of five to seven years (and 8 years for the 1985 cohort)\nregardless of whether the individual had to re-sit some examinations. Dropout is defined as\nwithdrawal from the medical degree program for whatever reason. In particular, if a student\nchanges the degree program half-way through then this student is deemed to have withdrawn\nfrom the medical program. All those who dropped out of the program after five program\nyears are assumed to have dropped out in the final year of the program.  Thus, the standard\nlength of the medical program, which is five years, is used as the duration time in our\n8analysis rather than the actual calendar time taken for completion.  Hence, by the end of the\nfifth year there is assumed to be a forced termination: a successful completion, or a dropout.\nTable 1 provides some information about dropout rates. The 1985 cohort consists of\n3,889 students, while the 1986 cohort has 3,900 students. The unconditional non-completion\nrate for all students who started a medical degree in either 1985 or 1986 is 10.7% (and is the\nsame for each of the two years individually). From these two cohorts of medical students\n7.9% actually drop-out from university altogether, this non-completion rate compares with a\nvalue of 8.9% obtained by Smith and Naylor (2001b) looking at all three and four-year\ndegree courses for students commencing a degree at the start of the academic year in 1989.\nLooking at the conditional dropout rates of medical students, we see that conditional\ndropout is a rare event and is surprisingly similar across the two cohorts.  More specifically,\nas the student progresses through the program, the aggregate figures for conditional dropout\ndecline quite dramatically. About 50% of those who do not complete their medical degree\nleave prior to the start of their 2nd year. This finding is very similar to that found by Smith\nand Naylor (2001b), where across all students, the equivalent figure was 55%, and is similar\nto that found in the U.S. by Porter (1990) across all students. After the first year, the\nconditional rate of withdrawal declines. In particular, the conditional dropout rate in the final\nyear of the program is only 0.37%. Given these small numbers, we have combined together\nboth the two cohorts and also years four and five of the program.\n4. Econometric Model and Issues\nIn the current paper, our objective is to model the conditional probability that an\nindividual will drop out of a medical degree program during some small time interval,\nconditional on not having dropped out up to that point: that is, the hazard function. As\nindicated above, the underlying variable is the time spent on the program rather than calendar\n9time. Unlike in conventional duration models, two specific characteristics of the program\nneed to be accounted for in this case. First, the program duration is limited to five years.\nBecause of this limited duration, the underlying continuous time duration variable will have a\ndistribution that is continuous over the interval (0,5) and a discrete probability mass at the\nend point of 5 years. Second, the program cannot be completed before the end of five years.\nThat is, the probability of successfully completing the program during the first five years is\nzero.6\nWe use the Cox\u2019s Proportional Hazards Model as a starting assumption. Given the\nabove characterisation of the program of studies, the hazard for individual i, \u03b8i(t), is\nparameterised as\ni\u03b8 (t)=\u03bb(t)exp( )    (t 5 years)<ix '\u03b2 (1)\nwhere \u03bb(t) is the baseline hazard at time t, xi is the vector of characteristics for individual i\n(excluding the intercept term) and \u03b2 is the corresponding vector of unknown coefficients. As\ndiscussed earlier, because of possible measurement errors in the recording of the date of\ndropout, for the purpose of the analysis presented here the duration information has been re-\ncoded in terms of whole years completed. A recorded duration of t whole years therefore\nindicates duration on the continuous time-scale, between t-1 and t years. Hence, the\nprobability of exiting by time t conditional on xi, given that the student was still on the\nprogram at time t-1 is given by\n( ) [ ]\n \n1i i\n1\n1 1  \u03b8 (\u03c4) \u03c4\nt\ni i i\nt\nh t | Pr ob T t | t T exp d\n\u2212\n\u0001\n= < \u2212 \u2264 = \u2212 \u2212\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0001x\n                                                \n6 Mealli, et al. (1996) consider a duration-limited competing risks model in the context of Youth Training\nPrograms. Booth and Satchell (1995), and van Ours and Ridder (2000) look at a related model for PhD\ncompletion rates.\n10\n           { }\n \n1\n 1- \u03bb(\u03c4)  \u03c4\nt\ni\nt\nexp exp ' d\n\u2212\n\u0001\n= \u2212\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0001 x \u03b2  \n( ){ } 1-  \u03b4iexp exp ' t\u0001= \u2212 +\u0002 x \u03b2 (2)\nwhere           \n \n1\n\u03b4( ) \u03bb( ) \u03c4\nt\nt\nt ln d\u03c4\n\u2212\n\u0001 \u0002\n= \u0003 \u0004\n\u0005 \u0006\n\u0001 (3)\nWe thus have an Extreme-value form for the hazard model in discrete time.7\nAs seen earlier, the degree program finishes at the end of year 5.8 There is thus a\nforced termination at this point. In order to account for this, it is assumed that these limit\npoint probabilities take the same Extreme-value form as before but with a different set of\ncoefficients. This is specified as\n( )2i i5h t |= =x Prob[dropping out in year 5 | survival up to year 5, xi]\n{ }1 iexp exp ' \u03b7= \u2212 \u2212 +\u0001\u0002 x \u03b1  (4)\nwhere \u03b1 is the vector of unknown coefficients and \u03b7=is the intercept term.\nA useful way of looking at the above specifications is in terms of a binary model since\neach individual in the sample can be thought of as contributing a maximum of five\nobservations to the likelihood function. The binary variable will take the value of one if the\nindividual drops out during the year and zero otherwise. To be more specific, let Ti be the\nrecorded duration in years for individual i. Define a set of indicator variables, c and f such\nthat, fi = 1 if the individual drops out of the program in the first four years, and fi = 0\notherwise; ci = 1 if the individual successfully completes the program, and ci = 0 if he\/she\n                                                \n7 See Narendranathan and Stewart (1993a, 1993b) for a model of unemployment duration in discrete time.\n8 Because of possible endogeneity, no distinction is made between those who had an intercalated year to\ncomplete a science degree and those who did not.\n11\ndrops out in the final year. Then the log-likelihood contribution by individual i with a\nrecorded duration of Ti is given by\nln Li = fi ln[h1i(Ti)] + (1-fi)(1-ci) ln[h2i] \u2013 (\nimin(T 4)\n2\n,\nt=\nln[1-h1i(t-1)] )\u2013 ci ln[1-h2i] (5)\nAs there is no unobserved heterogeneity in the above model, the likelihood function\n(5) factors into two parts, where the parameters of the first and the second hazards can be\nestimated separately.9\nThe main advantage of working within the binary variable framework is that we are\nthen able to relax the extreme value assumption and use standard models such as probit and\nlogit. Unlike the extreme value distribution, probit and logit distributions are symmetric with\nrespect to their means, although they do differ in the tail behaviour.\nUnobserved heterogeneity\nIt is well known that failure to control for any unobserved individual-specific effects that may\naffect the hazard function will result in misleading inference due to inconsistent parameter\nestimators (Lancaster, 1990). The previous model can be extended for this purpose by\nincluding a random error term along with the vector of characteristics x. This requires an\nassumption regarding the distribution of this unobservable individual-specific error term.10 In\nnone of the models we estimated could we find any evidence of unobservables. The models\n                                                \n9 The above model also can be thought of in a competing-risks framework where the two risks faced by the\nindividuals are completion and dropping out.  Since the degree program lasts for a minimum of five years, the\ncompletion specific hazard has to be set equal to zero for the periods up to the 5 years.  This model then\ncollapses to the one specified above.\n10 In addition to the assumption regarding the actual distribution of the unobservables, we also require the\nassumption of independence of the unobservables and the included regressors in order to marginalise with\nrespect to these unobservables.  The models for the unobservables that were tried were: normally distributed\nunobservables, normally distributed unobservables with allowance for different masses at the end points, and\na two mass point discrete distribution.\n12\nwith unobservables always converged to the same point as the models without unobservables.\nTherefore, we report results only from models without unobservables.\n5. Empirical Results\nAnalysis of student dropout behaviour has received much attention in the US, where one of\nthe most influential theoretical explanations of student attrition is the path analyses model of\nTinto (1975, 1987). This model and related analyses suggest that the major determinants of\ncompletion are likely to be the student\u2019s (i) academic preparedness, and (ii) social and\nacademic integration into the educational institution. The analysis identifies a number of key\ninfluences on the withdrawal probability, including: the student\u2019s previous schooling, prior\nacademic performance, family background and personal characteristics, as well as\ninstitutional characteristics. In our model of student dropout probabilities, we therefore\ninclude control variables reflecting the student\u2019s prior academic preparedness, their social\nbackground and personal characteristics.11 Previous schooling includes both prior\nqualifications of students and the type of school attended prior to university. Part of the\nmotivation for the latter comes from the general issue of the impact of school quality and\nschool type on later outcomes (see Moffit (1996)). In one of our models, we include dummy\nvariables for the medical institution attended.12 In a second model, we replace the medical\nschool dummy variables with a set of variables measuring characteristics of the medical\nschool attended by the student.\nIn order to obtain data on a satisfactory number of dropouts in each year of the\nprogram, the models have been estimated by combining the two cohorts, with a year dummy\n                                                \n11 In an analysis of the dropout behaviour of all UK University students matriculating in 1989, Smith and Naylor\n(2001b) find evidence in support of a role for both academic preparedness and social integration. They use a\nsimple probit model based on the incidence of a student dropping out of university.\n12 Due to small cell sizes and the amalgamation of some London medical schools over our sample period, the\nUniversity of London medical schools were treated as a single medical school.\n13\nincluded to account for any aggregate macro effect. The dependent variable takes the value of\none in a year if the individual drops out of the program in that year and zero otherwise.\nBecause of the very small number of withdrawals after year four, the final hazard refers to\nyear four onwards. We thus have one hazard specification for years 1 to 3 (see h1 in equation\n(2)) which models the dropout\/continuation process, and another hazard specification for the\nrest of the period (h2 in equation (4)) which models the dropout\/completion process.\nPrior to the discussion of the results, we consider the testing procedure used to\ndiscriminate between various models. The maximised log likelihood values for a set of\nestimated models are presented in Table 2. When the three types of model \u2013 Extreme value,\nlogit and probit \u2013 are estimated without any covariates, the maximised values are exactly the\nsame. The differences caused by the distributional assumptions become apparent when\ncovariates are included in the model. The log likelihood values in the second panel of Table 2\nrefer to a model that includes the full set of covariates. Among the symmetric distributions\n(logit and probit), probit performs very poorly. But there is essentially no difference between\nthe extreme value model derived from the proportionality assumption for the underlying\ncontinuous time hazard and the logit model that does not impose this restriction.13 The\nrestriction that the effects of the covariates are the same in both the hazards in the logit\nspecification is easily rejected by the data (see bottom panel of Table 2) with a \u03c72(50) value\nof 194.8 and p-value of [0.00]. On the basis of this, we choose the logit model with\nunrestricted coefficients across the two hazards as our preferred model. This model does not\nimpose the proportionality assumption like the extreme value model. The definitions and\nsummary statistics for the variables used in the analyses are provided in Table 3.\n                                                \n13The estimated marginal effects were very similar across the extreme value and the logit models.\n14\nIn the UK, the usual age of entry into a university medical school is 18. Looking at\nTable 3 we see that 67% of our sample members are aged 18 or less on entry, with a slightly\nlower proportion found among the dropouts compared to those who successfully complete.\nAlthough our sample contains an approximately equal split of male and female students,\nmales are found to dominate among the dropouts. A very small proportion of students were\nmarried when they entered the program.\nIn the two cohorts used in the analysis, 94% of the students were of UK nationality.\nFees charged by universities depend on the nationality as well as on some residency\nconditions. In general, UK students are liable for a UK fee which is much smaller than the\noverseas student\u2019s fees. In any case, for the cohorts we are analysing in the present paper, all\nfees facing UK students were paid for by the student\u2019s local education authority. A European\nUnion student would be liable for paying the UK level of fees. Currently, this is just over\n\u00a31,000 per annum. The overseas fee varies across universities, but is currently around \u00a39,000\nper annum for the 2 pre-clinical years and \u00a317,000 per annum for the 3 clinical years.\nOverseas fee-paying students account for only 4% of the population but 6% among the\ndropouts.\nPrior to entering university, most UK students study in secondary school towards\nqualifications which will determine the success of their applications to higher education.\nBroadly, we can distinguish between two types of school: those which are in the private\nsector (henceforth, \u2018Independent\u2019 schools) and those which are in the broadly-defined state\nsector. The latter consists of various sub-categories of school, including local education\nauthority (LEA) comprehensive schools, grammar schools (to which admission is selective\nand subject to educational tests) and colleges of further education. In the school population of\nthe UK as a whole, about 7% of pupils attend an Independent school. In contrast, around 34%\n15\nof medical students went to an Independent school. This is markedly higher even than the\n27% observed for the group of all (non-medical) students used in Smith and Naylor (2001b).\nThe pre-university secondary school qualifications which form the basis for offers of\nplaces at medical schools are, typically, \u2018A-levels\u2019 for English and Welsh school pupils, and\n\u2018Highers\u2019 for school pupils from Scotland and Northern Ireland. Offers of university places\nare typically conditional on the candidate\u2019s performance in their best three A-levels (or best\nfive Highers).14 In addition, a number of medical schools interview candidates prior to\nmaking an offer of a place on the course. The average A-level (Higher) score from the best\nthree (five) subjects was 25.5 (13.7) points (equivalent to grades of around ABB), with some\n27% of the cohort having the maximum 30 (15) points.15 Some 2% of students had no prior\nqualification recorded and 4% already had a prior qualification obtained from a university in\nthe UK.16 Approximately 50% of students arriving for a medical degree had either A-levels\nor Scottish\/Irish Highers in Chemistry, Physics and Biology.\nThe social class background of students entering a medical degree program shows that\naround 35% come from Social Class I (Professional) (with 39% of these actually coming\nfrom a background in which one of the parents or the guardian is a medical practitioner) and\n38% for Social Class II (Intermediate professions). This compares with only 19% of all\nstudents starting a 3 or 4-year degree in 1989 coming from a Professional background and\n62% from either Professional or Intermediate.\nSummarising with respect to the characteristics of those among the dropout sample,\n                                                \n14 A-levels are classified as A through to E. These grades can be converted into a points score: A=10 points,\nB=8 points, C=6 points, D=4 points, and E=2 points. Highers are classified as A through to C: A=3 points,\nB=2 points and C=1 point.\n15 This compares to an average A-level score of 23.7 for non-medical students. On average, then, medical\nstudents have better A-level qualifications than other students.\n16  An analysis excluding the 2% of individuals who had no qualifications did not change the results.\n16\ncompared to those who successfully complete the degree program, there is a slightly larger\nproportion of individuals, (i) aged more than 19, (ii) who are men,  (iii) paying non-UK fees,\n(iv) who have an average A-Level score which is much lower than ABB, and (v) who have\nmore than the standard 3 A-Levels.\nThe derived marginal effects on the rates of withdrawal and the corresponding p-\nvalues for the estimated logit models are reported in Table 4 (see footnote 2 to Table 4 for an\nexplanation of how these marginal effects are calculated). Model 1 includes a set of\nuniversity dummies among the covariates. The results from Model 1 are presented in columns\n[1] and [2]. In order to investigate further the ceteris paribus effects of universities, we also\nexperimented by replacing the dummies with some variables that reflected the nature of the\nmedical faculty in that particular university.  These were: number of undergraduates, number\nof postgraduates on taught degrees, number of postgraduates on research degrees,\nexpenditure on salaries per medical student, expenditure per medical student from research\ngrants, percentage of professors among the staff in the faculty, percentage of senior staff,\npercentage of research staff, separate binary indicators for Scottish, Welsh and Irish\nuniversities. Results from substituting the university dummies with university characteristics,\ncalled Model 2, are presented in columns [3] and [4]. Columns [1] and [3] refer to the drop-\nout\/continuation hazard (h1), and [2] and [4] to the drop-out\/completion hazard (h2). As seen\nearlier (in Table 2), the restriction that the covariate effects are the same is easily rejected.\nThe estimated pattern of age effects suggests that students aged 20 or 21 at the\nenrolment time are less likely to drop out compared to someone aged l8 or less. But, these\neffects are reversed when we consider successful completion. Conditional on progressing to\nthe final years of the program, an individual who was 21 or more at the start of the program\nhas an increased probability of withdrawal at the last stages of the program. More\nspecifically, relative to someone who is 18 at the time of enrolment, this individual is\n17\nestimated to have an increased withdrawal rate of 4.8 percentage points, ceteris paribus.\nMales are found to be significantly more likely to withdraw than females, but only in the\nlatter parts of the program.\nNationality and the fees status of students are found to play a significant role in the\nfirst few years of the program. UK students and those who pay non-UK (non-EU) fees are\nless likely to withdraw in the first few years of the program, ceteris paribus.\nThere are very strong and well-determined coefficients on prior qualifications. These\neffects are picked up by various binary indicator variables on the type of prior qualifications\nas well as by the actual scores obtained for students who had taken either A-Level or Higher\nqualifications.\nWith respect to performance at A-Level or in Highers, we note that although it is\ncustomary in UK Medical Schools to require a student to obtain three (five) A-Level (Higher)\npasses prior to entry, some students do more subjects than the required number. In order to\nallow for this, we include the actual scores they obtained in their best three (five) A-Level\n(Higher) examinations and also the scores from the rest, if they had more than the required\nnumber. As expected, the effect from A-levels (and Highers) on the dropout rates during the\nentire degree program period is estimated to be negative and declining towards the final years\nof the program. An extra two points on the A-Level average (equivalent to an extra A-Level\ngrade) reduces the dropout probability by about 0.6 percentage points, ceteris paribus. A\nsimilar negative effect is also found for Highers. These negative effects are somewhat\nreduced if the individual had come from a church school and also has more than the\ncustomarily required three (five) A-Level (Higher) subjects. The finding that the student\u2019s\nlevel of performance at A-level (Highers) has statistically significant effects on the dropout\nprobability is in line with the hypothesis that academic preparedness for a medical degree is\nan important factor determining continuation and completion.\n18\nLooking at A-level (Higher) subjects, assuming that a strong background in Biology,\nChemistry and Physics is likely to be appropriate for medical students, we include three\ndummy variables for those students who have one, two, or three of these subjects.17 Relative\nto those with only two of the three of these subjects, all the other students are found to be\nslightly less likely to withdraw, ceteris paribus. This non-monotonic result is somewhat\ncounter-intuitive. One possible explanation is that students with three pre-university science\nsubjects are likely to be best prepared and this is reflected in their lower drop-out probability.\nStudents with only one science subject prior to university medical school are in a relative\nminority and are potentially under-prepared. However, such students are likely to be\ndisproportionately highly motivated to study medicine: indeed, they are likely to have had to\ndemonstrate possession of appropriate characteristics (unobserved in our data-set) to\nconvince admissions selectors to offer them places notwithstanding their subject portfolio.\nWe are, however, unable to test this hypothesis directly within our data-set.\nWe find that students who have \u2018other\u2019 UK university qualifications or \u2018other\u2019\noverseas qualifications are much less likely to drop out before completion relative to those\nstudents who have only the standard A-Level\/Higher scores, ceteris paribus. The \u2018other\u2019\nqualification variable may refer to a degree or a diploma. Prior qualification data includes\ninformation only on the individual\u2019s highest academic qualifications \u2013 not their full profile of\nprevious attainment. Therefore, the very strong negative direct effect of one percentage point\nis additional to any indirect effect associated with A-Level and Higher scores. However, the\neffect of this variable is not significant in the final year except when the qualification is an\noverseas one. Because of their previous successful academic experiences, these students with\n                                                \n17 An original specification had dummies for whether the student had A-levels (Highers) in Physics, Chemistry\nor Biology or some combination of these. Results in Table 4 are arrived at having tested the implied\nrestrictions.\n19\na previous university qualification are hypothesised to be more able to persevere with the\nvery strenuous and lengthy medical program: in a sense, they have already signalled\nthemselves as such. Students with no recorded qualification or with qualifications that could\nnot be categorised are also less likely to dropout. These are in addition to those effects\ncoming via any unobserved A-Level and Higher scores.\nIn terms of the debate about widening access into medical schools, it is interesting to\nexamine whether the effect on the dropout probability associated with the level of\nperformance in pre-university examinations differs by school background. One hypothesis\nwould be that the A-level performance of students from the non-Independent school sector\nmight be an under-estimate of their underlying ability and hence the negative effect of A-\nlevel performance, say, might be lower for ex-pupils of state-schools compared to\nIndependent schools.18 There would then be less concern about the possible adverse effects of\nreducing A-level entry standards if this were targeted at applicants from the state school\nsector. In order to test for these kinds of effects, we included binary indicators for school type\nand also interactions of these with the actual scores obtained in the main entry qualification.\nThe only significant effect on withdrawal probabilities associated with the type of school\nattended was for someone who had gone to a church school. This significant negative effect\nwas only present in the first few years of the program. Relative to someone who had been to a\nLocal Education Authority school, someone coming from a church school, is 6.3% less likely\nto dropout in the first years of the program, ceteris paribus. Thus, we found no evidence in\nsupport of the hypothesis concerning the possible difference in the effects of prior\nqualifications between (non-church) Independent and state-educated students.\n                                                \n18 See Smith and Naylor (2001a) for evidence consistent with this hypothesis.\n20\nThe social class effects are found to be weak in general and show little effect. An\nexception is the significant negative effect for individuals from Social Class category\n\u2018Intermediate\u2019 on the withdrawal rate in the latter parts of the program for students. We note\nthat a student whose parent is a medical practitioner is less likely to withdraw, although the\neffect is not well determined. We also interacted prior academic performance with social\nclass background, but found no significant effects.\nIn summary, we have found that academic preparedness, as measured by prior\nqualifications, is a statistically significant determinant of the medical student\u2019s probability of\ndropping out of the medical program. This would indicate that any policy of relaxing entry\nstandards in order to increase the number of medical students would run the risk of raising\nmedical school wastage rates. A similar risk arises if a policy of widening access is\nimplemented simply through reducing entry standards for certain groups. Indeed, we found\nno evidence that the drop-out probabilities of students from particular school or social\nbackgrounds which might be favoured by wider access policies were less sensitive to\nprevious academic performance. Nor, however, did we find strong evidence that school and\nfamily background exerted an influence on the drop-out probability.\nWe now turn to the results for Model 2 where the university dummies are replaced by\na set of university characteristics (see note 3 of Table 4 for a list of these variables). The\nresults are reported in Columns [3] and [4] of Table 4. The estimated marginal effects are\nbroadly similar across the two models. Of the university characteristics only two variables are\nsignificant at the 10% level: universities with a higher proportion of the staff as Professors\nhave a lower probability of drop-out in the first period hazard, and universities with higher\nlevels of expenditure on salaries tend to have higher probabilities of students dropping-out.\n21\n6. Predicted Probabilities\nAs we saw earlier the average raw unconditional probability of withdrawal was 10.7% (Table\n1).  This figure does not control for characteristics of the individual. The estimated models\nwere for the conditional probability of withdrawal from the program conditioned on not\nhaving withdrawn up to that point. The discussion in the previous section was in terms of\nhow the estimated conditional probability changes because of a ceteris paribus change of a\ncharacteristic for an \u2018average\u2019 individual (i.e. marginal effects).  In this section we translate\nthese estimated conditional withdrawal probabilities into unconditional probabilities of\nwithdrawal from the program for individuals with some chosen characteristics. These are\npresented in Table 5.\nWe start with a reference individual who dominates in terms of the characteristics\nused in the analysis. This individual, labelled \u2018Man 1\u2019, is a UK male aged 18, who had\nattended a Local Education Authority (state) school, came from a professional social class\nbackground, had the three \u2018favoured\u2019 science-related subjects among his A-Level\nqualifications, with a score of 26 points for his best three A-Level subjects, and a score of 8\npoints for a fourth A-Level subject.  The dropout probability for this individual is predicted to\nbe 6.37% under Model 1.  We note that for an otherwise identical female student (Woman 1),\nthe predicted drop-out probability is slightly less at 6.22%. The rest of the table illustrates\nhow the drop-out probability changes with one-at-a-time changes in the male individual\u2019s\nbase characteristics.\nFirst, we observe how a reduction in the number of favoured prior qualification\nsubjects (from 3 to 2) raises the predicted drop-out probability to almost 9% (compare Man 2\nwith Man 1). Second, we observe that the student (Man 3) who has specialised in just 3 A-\nlevels, choosing not to take optional courses (and therefore has a zero score for \u2018other\u2019 A-\n22\nlevels), has a predicted drop-out probability of less than 3%. Comparing Man 3, Man 4 and\nMan 6, we see how raising the best-3-subject A-level score from 26 to the maximum of 30\npoints reduces the predicted drop-out probability to just 1.03%, for the student with just 3 A-\nlevels. A comparison on Man 6 and Man 9 shows that the drop-out of a student who had\nattended an Independent school is, ceteris paribus, greater than that of a student from a local\neducation authority school: though we know from Table 4 that this difference is not\nstatistically significant. Comparisons of Man 11 through Man 15 demonstrates how the\npredicted dropout probability becomes very high for a student with a relatively poor\nperformance at A-level, especially when that student took more than 3 A-level subjects but\nwith fewer than three in favoured science disciplines, and when the student previously\nstudied at a further education college. We conclude that any attempt at increasing the number\nof medical students by lowering A-level requirements would potentially increase the overall\nwastage rate from medical schools. To avoid this, compensating policies such as better\nadmissions targeting or increased academic support and mentoring might be necessary.\nFigure 1 reports the estimated coefficients and the 95% confidence interval around\nthese coefficients for each of the medical schools, relative to the median school (the reference\ncategory), from the drop-out\/continuation hazard for Model 1. As can be clearly seen only 4\nschools perform significantly differently from the median medical school: 1 performing\nsignificantly better and 3 performing significantly worse. On the basis of these estimated\nmedical schools coefficients, we calculate the unconditional probability that a weighted\naverage of \u2018Man 1\u2019 and \u2018Woman 1\u2019 will drop-out at each medical school.19 We call this the\nadjusted medical school effect. We can compare this with the unadjusted medical school\n                                                \n19 The dropout probability varies markedly according to the medical school attended. For the composite\nindividual \u2018Man 1\u2019\/\u2018Woman 1\u2019 the predicted range is 2.7%-11.5%.\n23\neffect, which is simply the average dropout rate for each school. Figure 2 plots the adjusted\nagainst the unadjusted medical school effects. We notice that the correlation between the two\nis almost zero. This leads us to the conclusion that league tables of medical school\nperformance against the criterion of institutional drop-out rates are likely to be potentially\nmisleading indicators of performance if they do not take into account differences across\nschools in relevant attributes.\n7. Summary and Conclusion\nThe results show that the decision to withdraw from medical school is not random and is\nstrongly determined by both personal characteristics and, in particular, by the level of\nperformance in prior qualifications. Students with high A-level (Higher) grades are markedly\nless likely to withdraw from their medical degree. Surprisingly, this effect persists over the\nentire period of the degree. Similarly, the choice of A-level subjects taken is important in\npreparing students for their degree. For example, it is better to have all science subjects\ncompared to just having 2 sciences. The dropout probability is also lower for students who\nhave specialised in just three subjects rather than taking additional optional subjects at A-\nlevel. There are few social class effects, but gender is statistically significant, with male\nstudents more likely to dropout. Age is also an important determinant, although its effect is\nnot linear.\nWe have found that academic preparedness is a statistically significant determinant of\nthe student\u2019s probability of dropping out of medical school. This indicates that any relaxing\nof entry standards in order to increase medical student numbers \u2013 or to widen access \u2013 would\nrun the risk of raising medical school wastage rates. On the issue of widening access,\nhowever, we found no strong evidence that school and family background exert an influence\non the dropout probability. Our conclusion is that any policies to widen access to medical\nschool need to be targeted specifically on students whose prior qualification levels of\n24\nachievement are likely to underestimate their true potential for a medical degree. In the\nabsence of such targeting, a policy of reducing entry standards is likely to lead to higher\nwastage rates. Furthermore, it is likely that other aspects of medical student performance are\nsimilarly sensitive to prior levels of educational attainment. We leave testing this hypothesis\nto further work.\n25\nReferences\nAngel, C. and Johnson, A.
