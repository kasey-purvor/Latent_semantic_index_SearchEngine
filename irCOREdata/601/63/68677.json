Co-\nanalysis of sediment solutes is particularly valuable as it allows interpretation of geochemical \nprocesses based on the behaviour of multiple analytes at the same precise time and \nlocations. This technique has the ability to provide information on sub-mm scale processes \nwithin sediment, including in two-dimensions, and also profiling across the sediment-water \ninterface. It has potential applications in the monitoring or assessment of the mobility of \npollution from mine wastes (e.g. As and Sb). The technique can also be adapted for looking \nat the geochemistry of the target elements at the soil-plant root interface.  \nSummary \nPrevious work used the sampling technique diffusive gradients in thin-films analysed by laser \nablation mass spectrometry to measure sulphide, P, V and As at a microniche of reactive \n  \norganic carbon in a freshwater sediment. Here we present new developments of this \ntechnique. The number of analytes has been extended and we demonstrate the technique \nfor depth profiling of analytes in both one and two dimensions. The physical dimensions of \nthe cell in the laser ablation unit restrict the maximum length of gel that can be analysed. We \naddress this problem by proposing a method for obtaining better data continuity when \nanalysing multiple segments of gel from the same probe. 13C is used as the internal standard \nfor each gel segment. For the cross standardisation of different gel segments 58Fe signals \nare obtained from ablation of a small piece of standard ferrihydrite gel analysed during the \nsame run as the sample gel. As the ferrihydrite gel is a subsection of a much larger gel (i.e. \nthe Fe concentration is consistent for all subsection), then any difference in signal can be \nattributed to changes in detector sensitivity and gels across different runs and performed on \ndifferent days can be standardised.   \nIntroduction \nWith recent developments of new sensors there is increasing interest in studying chemical \nprocesses in sediment at high-resolution. Such measurements allow processes occurring on \na localised scale to be observed and the effect of these processes on diagenesis of the \nwhole system can be reported. Furthermore, co-analysis of multiple sediment solutes is \nparticularly valuable as it allows interpretation of geochemical processes based on the \nbehaviour of multiple analytes at the same precise time and locations. Two-dimensional \nprobes are currently available for trace metals, nutrients, dissolved gases and pH.1 Planar \noptodes have been used to investigate, in two-dimensions and at sub-mm resolution, profiles \nof single components across the sediment water interface (SWI).2 Two components have \nbeen analysed simultaneously across the SWI using a combination of the sampling \ntechniques diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) and diffusive equilibration in thin-films \n(DET).3  DGT when deployed in sediment gives a measurement that reflects the porewater \nconcentration and the amount of solute that can be re-supplied to the sediment-probe \ninterface via diffusion and desorption from the solid phase (CDGT). We have previously \n  \nreported the use of a combined silver iodide ferrihydrite binding phase for the DGT \ntechnique for the 2D analysis of the anions of P, V, As, and S within sediment.4  Here we \npresent new developments of this technique. The number of analytes has been extended to \nadditionally include 94Mo, 121Sb, 182W and 238U, and we demonstrate the technique for depth \nprofiling of these analytes across the SWI. The physical dimension of the cell in the laser \nablation unit restrict the maximum length of gel that can be analysed. To overcome this \nproblem we propose a method for obtaining better data continuity when analysing multiple \nsegments of gel from the same probe.  \nExperimental \nSample collection and gel preparation, deployment, drying and analysis procedures followed \nthose previously used.4, 5 The DGT binding phase used was a combined silver iodide \nferrihydrite binding layer capable of binding sulphide and a range of anions.4 To reduce \nblank levels we used ultra-pure reagents to prepare the gels: silver nitrate (Alfa Aesar, \nPremion grade, 99.9995%), sodium hydrogen carbonate (Alfa Aesar, Puratronic grade, \n99.998%),  iron nitrate nonahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999+%) and potassium iodide \n(Merck, Suprapur grade, 99.995%). For this work three probes were deployed in individual \nintact sediment cores with temperature controlled flowing overlying water. Cores were \ncollected from Esthwaite Water, a freshwater lake in the English Lake District. Post \ndeployment preparation of gels for analysis followed previously reported procedures.4 \nBriefly, gels dried onto a backing filter (maximum dimensions ~1.8 \u00d7 15 cm) were cut into \n~1.5 \u00d7 4 cm pieces and mounted onto glass slides with double sided tape. Analysis was \nperformed on the upper segment of gel (across the SWI) for all three probes, with one probe \nbeing selected for the analysis of a larger depth range across three slices. The ablation is \nperformed in lines of spots vertically down the gel, with a distance between spots of 500 \u00b5m, \nThere are typically 22-28 ablation lines on each gel.  \n  \nDetector counts from laser ablation coupled with inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-\nICP-MS) tend to be relatively stable over the time of ablating one gel. However, detector \npeak or background counts do not tend to be equal over a period of days or weeks. In \nlaboratories where the ICP-MS is used for aqueous as well as LA samples, the switching of \ndedicated consumables (e.g. torch, cones) and the requirement to re-tune, mean that peak \ndetector counts at a given analyte concentration will give large variations between LA runs.   \n58Fe has several properties that make it an ideal candidate for use as an internal standard on \ngels. Namely, a very low detector background, high peak signals and a mass within the \nrange of the other analytes. However, 58Fe cannot be used to standardise signals across a \ndeployed gel, as iron oxides precipitate within the gel at the oxic sub-oxic interface. We use \na procedure that uses two different analytes for standardisation. 13C (a major component of \nthe gel matrix6) is used for internal standardisation of single gel segments. Each ablation \nspot is standardised to 13C based on the average for all ablation spots on the gel segment. \nDue to a relatively low peak to background ratio and high background counts, 13C is not ideal \nfor standardisation of data generated on different days and across gel segments. To improve \ncontinuity when analysing multiple gels, including segments from the same probe, we used a \nprocedure that fixes a piece of a standard ferrihydrite gel (~0.5 cm2; a subsection of a much \nlarger piece of gel ~1.5 \u00d7 15 cm) on the same slide as each segment of deployed gel. As the \nferrihydrite gel is a subsection of a much larger gel (i.e. the Fe concentration is consistent for \nall subsections), then any difference in signal can be attributed to changes in detector \nsensitivity. An average value from multiple ablation spots on this gel yield data for \nstandardising variations in detector signals on different days.   \nResults and discussion \nThe results of the high-resolution two-dimensional profiling are shown in Figure 1 with \nquantitative data for P, V and As, and qualitative data for 94Mo, 121Sb, 182W and 238U. \nPrevious work4 has reported the detection limits for the quantitative analysis so this \n  \ndiscussion is not repeated here. Colorimetric sulphide data were obtained for deployed \nprobes, however, results of this type have previously been reported in several studies3, 5, 7 so \nare not included here. The data in Figure 1 shown the potential of the technique for profiling \nin 2D and at sub-mm intervals across the SWI, adding to the toolbox of existing \ntechniques.1,3 Quantitative data was obtained for P, V, and As by analysis of standard gels \nprepared for previously reported work4 and using the cross calibration techniques described \nabove. Future work should focus on the improvement of calibration procedures to include the \nother analytes.  \nMany of the porewater solutes included in this study are generally measured using slicing of \nsediment cores and centrifugation to isolate the solutes. The technique presented here \nallows trends in these analytes to be studied at high-resolution, not only in 2D, but also in \n1D. This technique is particularly valuable in demonstrating heterogeneity in sediment \nsystems. However, we also sought to demonstrate how representative, averaged profiles \ncould be obtained when data from multiple probes are averaged. This may allow the co-\nanalysis of vertical profiles of these elements obtained in situ, and at higher resolution than \nother measurement techniques. Data for specific depths on multiple probes can be averaged \nto give 1D vertical profiles of analytes with error bars based on the standard deviations of the \nmeans (Figure 2). Here we show 1D averaged data, based on three individual deployed \nprobes. Multiple probes were deployed to reduce the effects of heterogeneity across \nindividual probes.  \nFigure 3 presents the results of the cross standardisation testing. Data for P and As are \npresented as they represent analytes with contrasting peak to background count ratios. P \ndata show a high level of continuity between the gel segments. The effectiveness of the \ntechnique can be illustrated by comparing the percent change in the detector counts to the \ncalculated concentration across the two gel transitions. From the upper to the central gel, the \npeak area (based on the detector signal) is increased by 39% whereas the corrected \n  \nconcentration only varies by -6%. For the centre to lower section the changes are -8% and \n3% respectively. This highlights the effectiveness of the procedure. Results for As show \nlower level of continuity, however, data at the transition between the segments are within \none standard deviation of the mean values. A small amount of instrument drift in the As \nsignal may cause this small deviation.   \nOur data were obtained from an unpolluted lake in the English Lake District. Several of the \nanalytes studied here may be present in mine spoil or smelter wastes.8 This technique could \nbe applied to the assessment or monitoring of sites affected by such activities. There has \nalso been an increase in interest in the environmental impact of Sb9 and this gel has the \npotential to be used in monitoring of this element. Recently DGT with this binding phase has \nbeen used for the measurement of phosphate at plant roots.10 The expansion of the number \nof analytes, as presented here, may aid interpretation of biogeochemical processes \noccurring in both soils and sediments. Measurement of additional analytes has no additional \nrequirements on the ICP-MS (provided interferences are considered). Therefore, additional \ndata can be obtained relatively easily, potentially allowing wider interpretation of the results.  \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank Debbie Hurst for assistance with sample collection.
