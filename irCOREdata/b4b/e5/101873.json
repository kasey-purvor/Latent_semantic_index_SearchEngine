INTRODUCTION.  Consider the two Kashmiri noun paradigms in Table 1. Kashmiri \ndistinguishes four values of the feature case (absolutive, ergative, ablative and dative) and \ntwo values of the feature number (singular and plural).  \n \n Declension I   Declension II \n \u2018ass\u2019   \u2018tree\u2019 \n SG PL   SG PL \nABS khar khar  ABS kul kul\u2019 \nERG kharan kharav  ERG kul\u2019 kul\u2019av \nABL khari kharav  ABL kuli kul\u2019av \nDAT kharas kharan  DAT kulis kul\u2019an \n \n \nTABLE 1. Kashmiri noun declension (Kachru 1969: 112-16) \n \nThe traditional paradigmatic arrangement in Table 1 implies that there are eight distinct \ninflected forms for each noun. But when we look more closely, we see that there is \nsyncretism in each paradigm -- that is, the same form is repeated in different paradigmatic \ncells. Thus khar is absolutive singular and absolutive plural, kharan is ergative singular and \ndative plural, kul\u2019 is ergative singular and absolutive plural, and both words have forms in -av \nfor the ergative and ablative plural.  \nSuch graphic representations of paradigms result from an analytical compromise, \nmotivated by the desire for a minimal repertory of morphosyntactic feature values. On the \none hand it is the morphological evidence of distinct forms which determines the repertory of \n                                               \n\u2217\n I\u2019d like to thank all the people who have provided helpful comments on this paper in its various versions, both \nwritten and oral: Jim Blevins, Jonathan Bobaljik, Dunstan Brown, Andrew Carstairs-McCarthy, Greville \nCorbett, Roger Evans, Gerald Gazdar, Martin Haspelmath, Louisa Sadler, Andrew Spencer and Greg Stump, as \nwell as editor Brian Joseph and the anonymous reviewers. The research reported here was supported by the \nEconomic and Social Research Council (United Kingdom) under grant number R000237939; their support is \ngratefully acknowledged. \n  \n1 \n \nfeatures. On the other hand, some morphological evidence is overlooked (for example, that \nthere seems to be a single form kharav, but it does not have a single morphosyntactic \ndescription). This is the price paid for a compact, manageable system of morphosyntactic \nfeatures. The practical advantages of such an approach are obvious, as anyone who has leafed \nthrough a Latin primer can attest: the varied patterns of case syncretism, richer even than \nwhat is found in Kashmiri, can be ignored in the in the account of syntactic rules. But there \nremains an uneasy discrepancy between the demands of a syntactic description and the \nmorphological facts. \nNor can this discrepancy be easily ignored, since syncretism is endemic in inflectional \nsystems: controlled cross-linguistic studies have shown that case syncretism is found in more \nthan half (40 out of 73) of the languages which mark case inflectionally (Baerman and Brown \nin press a), and syncretism of subject person marking on verbs is found in roughly two-thirds \n(60 out of 140) (Baerman and Brown in press b). It is fair to say that, if a language has \ninflectional morphology, it is likely to display syncretism, with case, person and gender being \nthe most typically affected features. \n Within morphological theory, inflectional syncretism is a long-standing theme (see, \nfor example, the on-line bibliography in Baerman (2002)). Broadly speaking, the theoretical \ninterest lies in what it can tell us both about feature structure and about morphological \noperations. On the one hand, we might assume that a single form corresponds to a single \nmeaning (a principle which, in Anttila\u2019s (1972: 107) words, \u2018is as old as European \nlinguistics\u2019). This would mean enriching our model of feature structure, e.g. by supposing \nthat the case values in Table 1 are actually compounds of smaller subvalues, which parcel off \ngroups of cases into natural classes. On the other hand, we might content ourselves with the \nflat feature structure in Table 1, in which case it is up to some purely morphological principle \nto account for the syncretism between paradigmatic cells. The choice between these two \napproaches has ramifications that reach beyond morphological theory: each provides \nsyntactic theory with a different repertory of morphosyntactic features to work with. \nSince the publication of Stump (2001), debate on this topic has intensified, centering on \nthe tripartite model of syncretism he presents. His three types of syncretism are illustrated \nbelow with examples drawn from the paradigms in Table 1. (For the sake of transparency, \nStump\u2019s rather complex vocabulary of formal representation has been simplified.) \n \nUNSTIPULATED SYNCRETISM occurs where the values involved form a natural class, so \nthat the syncretism results from underspecification, without any further devices. For \nexample, the declension I form khar involves syncretism of all of the paradigmatic cells \nwhich include the value absolutive in their description, namely absolutive singular and \nabsolutive plural. Absolutive defines a natural class uniting these two cells. The \nsyncretism will automatically result from a morphological description that invokes only \nthis shared value, without any reference to number; thus, absolutive = khar.  \n \nSYMMETRICAL SYNCRETISM occurs where the syncretized values do not constitute a \nnatural class. The declension I form kharav is good example, because in Stump\u2019s model, \nwhere feature values have no internal structure, ergative plural and ablative plural do not \nform a natural class (the smallest natural class that would contain them would be the set \nof all plural forms). Thus, we can simply stipulate that ergative plural and ablative plural \ntogether form a class, and say that this class has the form kharav. \n \nDIRECTIONAL SYNCRETISM likewise involves the stipulation of class membership, but \nexhibits directional effects, that is, it looks as if the form \u2018belongs\u2019 to one of the \ncomponent values, and is \u2018borrowed\u2019 by the other value. For example, the dative plural \n  \n2 \n \nending is -an for all noun declension classes in Kashmiri; in declension I, the ergative \nsingular ending is also -an. This could be described using a directional rule by stating that \nthe dative plural ending is -an for all nouns, and that, in declension I, the ergative singular \nhas the same form as the dative plural. Directional rules are most familiar under the name \n\u2018rules of referral\u2019, introduced by Zwicky (1985); Carstairs (1987) uses the term \n\u2018take-overs\u2019.  \n \nThis framework has prompted a number of critics, who argue that this wealth of \ndescriptive devices is unnecessary, and that at least one of these three devices should be \neliminated. The objections revolve around two points: \n \nFORMAL ECONOMY. There is considerable overlap in range of effects produced by these \nthree devices. For example, the form khar, used above to illustrate unstipulated \nsyncretism, could just as well be treated as symmetrical syncretism (by stipulating that \nabsolutive singular and absolutive plural form a class, whose form is khar) or directional \nsyncretism (by stipulating that the absolutive plural takes the form of the absolutive \nsingular, which is khar). All else being equal, we should eliminate superfluous formal \nmachinery. Since we can hardly eliminate the notion of classes (be they natural or \nunnatural) from a linguistic analysis, it is directional rules which should be rejected \n(Zwicky 2000, Wunderlich forthcoming). Directional effects are a merely surface \nphenomenon, and do not require a separate descriptive device. (Zwicky (2000) goes even \nfurther, and rejects the notion of unstipulated syncretism, arguing that natural classes are \nthemselves the product of a prior stage of essentially stipulative analysis.) \n \nRESTRICTIVENESS. Symmetrical syncretism and directional syncretism both involve \nstipulating relationships within an inflectional paradigm that are independent from feature \nstructure -- that is, independent from meaning or function. Thus, in principle, anything \ncould be syncretic with anything. A model based entirely on unstipulated syncretism \nwould be more restrictive, in that syncretism would be constrained by feature structure. \nAll else being equal, we should prefer the more restrictive model. Such an assessment is \napparent in a number of recent works (M\u00fcller forthcoming, Bobaljik 2002, Noyer 1998, \nCarstairs-McCarthy 1998). In fact, it is probably safe to say that most work on syncretism \ntakes this vantage point, in that explanation is typically sought in some aspect of feature \nstructure. \n \nThe insightfulness of the current debate is limited by some questions, both formal and \nempirical, that have not received sufficient attention. Formally, although the question of \nrestrictiveness is often raised, there is a dearth of precise statements about what can and \ncannot be described within any given model. Empirically, there is a range of phenomena \nwhich has simply not been considered. Below, I clarify what the descriptive potential of the \ndifferent devices is, and show that the facts require a robust model of inflectional \nmorphology, containing both directional rules and unnatural classes.  \n \n \n2. SYSTEMATIC VERSUS ACCIDENTAL HOMOPHONY. In treating syncretism as a matter for \nmorphological theory, one is assuming that it is somehow encoded in morphological \nrepresentation. However, one should also entertain the possibility that some examples may \nsimply be due to accidental homophony. Consider the Russian data shown in Table 2. \n  \n3 \n \n neuter o-stem \n stem-stress \n\u2018place\u2019 \nend-stress \n\u2018wine\u2019 \nNOM\/ACC SG m\u00e9st[\u0000] vin[\u00f3] \nGEN SG m\u00e9st[\u0000] vin[\u00e1] \n \nTABLE 2. Accidental homophony in Russian (partial phonetic transcription) \n \nIn an end-stressed neuter o-stem singular noun such as vino \u2018wine\u2019, the nominative\/accusative \nis distinct from the genitive, while in a stem stressed noun such as mesto \u2018place\u2019, these forms \nare identical. This is due to a regular phonological rule which obtains in Russian, whereby a \nand o are distinct only under stress. At the morphological level, we can think of mesto as \nhaving the same endings as vino; the collapse of the nominative\/accusative with the genitive \nis a superficial by-product of phonology.  \n However, there is good reason to believe that some syncretism is systematically \nencoded in the morphology. One diagnostic of systematicity is the repetition of the same \npattern of syncretism across multiple inflectional affixes or rules. A familiar example is the \nsyncretic dative\/ablative plural of Latin, which is realized by two different endings, -\u012bs and \n-ibus, depending on declension class. If we did not treat this as morphologically systematic, \nwe would have to assume the chance coincidence of two instances of accidental homophony.  \n Another indicator of systematicity is the diachronic extension of a syncretic pattern. \nAgain, Russian offers an example of this, illustrated in Table 3, based on Sologub (1983). \n \n i-stem \u2018dirt\u2019  a-stem \u2018wife\u2019 \n   standard type southern type western type \n      \nNOM SG grjaz\u2032-\u00d8  \u017een-a \u017een-a \u017een-a \nACC SG grjaz\u2032-\u00d8  \u017eenu \u017een-u \u017een-u \nGEN SG grjaz-i  \u017eeny \u017een-e \u017een-y \nDAT\/LOC SG grjaz-i  \u017een-e \u017een-e \u017een-y \n \nTABLE 3. Syncretism of genitive singular with dative\/locative in Russian dialects \n \nA-stem nouns originally distinguished the genitive singular from the dative\/locative (\u017eeny \n\u2018wife\u2019 versus \u017eene), a state of affairs still found in the standard language. However, in some \nsouthern and western dialects, these cases have fallen together, taking the form either of the \noriginal dative\/locative (\u017eene) or of the genitive (\u017eeny). These dialect developments cannot be \nattributed to sound change. According to Sologub (1983: 86), this was a morphological \ninnovation based on the pattern found in i-stem nouns such as grjaz\u2019 \u2018dirt\u2019, where these case \nforms are identical (the basis for this analogical extension was that both these declension \nclasses are primarily feminine, while the other classes are exclusively masculine or neuter). \nSignificantly, it was the pattern of case syncretism that was borrowed from the i-stems, and \nnot the case form itself.1 \n                                               \n1\n At least where the southern type with -e is concerned. The vowels -y [i] and -i [i], though originally distinct \nphonemes, now function as allophonic variants, -y being found after non-palatalized consonants, -i elsewhere. \n  \n4 \n \n In practice, the distinction between accidental and systematic homophony may be \nambiguous or fluid. Indeed, there is diachronic evidence that originally accidental patterns \ncan be reinterpreted as systematic. Thus, the syncretism of genitive, dative and locative \nsingular in Russian i-stems was originally the result of regular sound change (Proto-Indo \nEuropean -eis, -eyei and -\u0113i (Szemer\u00e9nyi 1989: 186-7) developed into Common Slavic -i), but \nlater served as a template for morphological change, as shown above.2 Other examples that \nhave been regarded as the morphological extension of originally accidental patterns include \nthe merger of 1PL with 2SG\/3SG feminine\/2PL in Dhaasanac (the B forms cited below in Table \n19; Sasse 1976: 219-20), 2SG\/3SG present in Old Icelandic (Haugen 1982: 129, Kury\u0142owicz \n1949 [1960: 81), 1SG\/3SG present in Livonian (Kettunen (1938: lx-lxii), and genitive \nsingular\/accusative plural in Slavic (Meillet and Vaillant 1934: 398). The examples discussed \nin this paper all seem to be plausible instances of systematic inflectional homophony. \n \n \n3.  DIRECTIONALITY. The mechanics of directional rules can be illustrated with a familiar \nexample from Latin, shown in  \nTable 4. Nominative and accusative are syncretic in neuter nouns and distinct in masculine \nnouns (at least in the singular). In the singular of the second declension, the form taken by the \nsyncretic nominative\/accusative of the neuters, -um, is the same as that of the distinct \naccusative case of the masculines. \n \n neuter  \n\u2018war\u2019 \nmasculine \n \u2018slave\u2019 \n    \nNOM SG bell-um  serv-us \nACC SG bell-um  serv-um \nGEN SG bell-\u012b  serv-\u012b \nDAT SG bell-\u014d  serv-\u014d \nABL SG bell-\u014d  serv-\u014d \n \nTABLE 4. Latin second declension \n \nThus, it looks as if the neuter nominative singular has taken the form of the accusative. Using \na directional rule, this apparent \u2018borrowing\u2019 can be incorporated directly in the analysis. First, \none can assume two general rules that apply to all second declension nouns: the nominative \nsingular ending is -us (1a), and the accusative singular ending is -um (1b). For neuters, there \nis a rule stating that the nominative singular takes the form of the accusative (1c).  \n \n                                                                                                                                                  \nThus, it might be possible to claim that the dative\/locative ending of a noun like grjaz-i (where it follows a \npalatalized consonant) was borrowed by nouns like \u017een-y (where it follows a non-palatalized consonant). Even \nso, such an account would not work for \u017een-e, since this ending is not found with the i-stems. \n2\n Alternatively, the failure to extend an originally accidental pattern may be taken as evidence that it remains \nunsystematic. For example, Ancient Greek had 1SG\/3PL in its past active paradigm, the result of regular \nphonological change. This pattern was never extended, and the syncretism was ultimately disambiguated by \nlater morphological innovations (Brian Joseph, personal communication). \n  \n5 \n \n(1) a. NOM SG = stem + -us  \n b. ACC SG = stem + -um \n c. NOM SG in neuter = ACC SG \n \nBecause the domain of the rule in (1c) is more specific than the domain of the rule in (1a), in \nthat it additionally contains reference to gender class, the rule in (1c) takes precedence by \nP\u0101n\n\u0001\nini\u2019s principle.3 \nThe morphological description above contains two rule types, one which associates a \nmorphosyntactic value with a form (1a, b), and one which associates one morphosyntactic \nvalue with another (1c). In the terminology introduced by Zwicky (1985), the former type is a \n\u2018rule of exponence\u2019, the latter a \u2018rule of referral\u2019. Rules of exponence, in some form, \nconstitute the backbone of any morphological model \u2014 they state the association between \nfunction and form. Rules of referral, however, might be seen as secondary, since they \ndescribe a covert, morphology-internal relationship. Many observers prefer to dispense with \nthis type of rule entirely, for reasons of formal economy. \nAmong the arguments against rules of referral, it is especially fitting to consider Zwicky\u2019s \n(2000) counterproposal, in as much as he introduced the term in the first place. He suggests \nthat all syncretism can be described as what Stump (2001) has called symmetrical syncretism, \nwith directional effects derived as a by-product of underspecification. I illustrate his proposal \nwith the same Latin data from  \nTable 4. First, declare that nominative and accusative singular form a class, which is \nassigned the index \u2018X\u2019 (2a). This class is associated with the ending -um (2b). In (2c) a more \nspecific rule is introduced, stating that the nominative singular of the masculines has the \nending -us, which takes precedence over the rule in (2b) by P\u0101n\n\u0001\nini\u2019s principle. \n \n(2) a. {NOM SG \u222a ACC SG} = X  \n b. X = stem + -um \nc. NOM SG in masculine = stem + -us   \n \nThus, under a SYMMETRICAL analysis, the specifically nominative singular masculine ending \n-us is opposed to the default nominative\/accusative ending -um. What looks like the spread of \nthe accusative form to the nominative is simply the emergence of the unmarked form. \nThis alternative analysis will work for examples of what Stump (2001) calls \nUNIDIRECTIONAL syncretism, that is, directional syncretism where the directional effect seems \nto move only in one direction (accusative \u0001 nominative in the above example). However, \nStump (2001) identifies another type, BIDIRECTIONAL syncretism, where the directional effect \nseems to move in two directions. This does not readily lend itself to the same analysis. It is \nuseful here to distinguish between two types, which I call convergent bidirectional syncretism \nand divergent bidirectional syncretism, to be defined below. Each one presents a distinct \nproblem for Zwicky\u2019s model.  \n \n \n3.1 CONVERGENT BIDIRECTIONAL SYNCRETISM. Under convergent bidirectional syncretism, \nthere is a feature value x which takes the form associated with feature value y in some \ncontexts, and in other contexts takes form associated with feature value z. This can be \nillustrated by a frequently discussed example, the nominative\/accusative~genitive\/accusative \nalternation of Russian. Most Russian nominal paradigms lack a distinct accusative form. \nInstead, it is syncretic with the genitive or with the nominative, the choice determined by the \n                                               \n3\n P\u0101n\n\u0003\nini\u2019s principle is also familiar as the elsewhere condition, blocking and the Subset principle. \n  \n6 \n \ninteraction of word class, declension class, gender, animacy and number. I limit myself to a \nsmall fragment of the total picture; this does not affect the argument at hand (more complete \nanalyses can be found in Corbett and Fraser (1993) and Brown (1998)). Table 5 illustrates \ntwo noun declension classes, the (masculine) o-stems and the i-stems. In the singular, the \no-stems display nominative\/accusative syncretism if inanimate, genitive\/accusative \nsyncretism if animate, while the i-stems display nominative\/accusative syncretism, regardless \nof animacy. In the plural, only animacy plays a role, inanimates having \nnominative\/accusative syncretism, animates having genitive\/accusative syncretism.4  \n \n o-stem  i-stem \n inanimate \n\u2018table\u2019 \nanimate \n\u2018student\u2019 \n inanimate \n\u2018bone\u2019 \nanimate \n\u2018mother\u2019 \n      \nNOM SG stol-\u00d8  student-\u00d8  kost\u2019-\u00d8  mat\u2019-\u00d8 \nACC SG stol-\u00d8  student-a  kost\u2019-\u00d8  mat\u2019-\u00d8 \nGEN SG stol-a student-a  kost-i mater-i \nLOC SG stol-e student-e  kost-i mater-i \nDAT SG stol-u student-u  kost-i mater-i \nINSTR SG stol-om student-om  kost-ju mater-ju \n      \nNOM PL stol-y  student-y  kost-i  mater-i \nACC PL stol-y  student-ov  kost-i  mater-ej \nGEN PL stol-ov student-ov  kost-ej mater-ej \nLOC PL stol-ax student-ax  kost-jax mater-jax \nDAT PL stol-am student-am  kost-jam mater-jam \nINSTR PL stol-ami student-ami  kost-jami mater\u2019-mi \n \nTABLE 5. A portion of Russian noun declension \n \nSeen in directional terms, it looks as if the accusative takes the form of the genitive in some \ncontexts, and the form of the nominative in other contexts. The following represents a \npossible description using directional rules. There are two rules of referral, shown in (3). By \ndefault, the accusative takes the form of the nominative (3a). With animate o-stems, and \neverywhere in the plural, animate accusatives take the form of the genitive (3b).

ACC in animate o-stem or in plural = GEN \n \n                                               \n4\n There are two further patterns displayed by the accusative: (i) it has a distinct form, regardless of animacy \n(singular of a-stem nouns and feminine adjectives), and (ii) it is syncretic with the genitive, regardless of \nanimacy (third person pronoun).   \n  \n7 \n \n(4) a. NOM SG = stem + -\u00d8 \nb. GEN SG in o-stem = stem + -a \nc. GEN SG in i-stem = stem + -y\/-i5 \nd. NOM PL = stem + -y\/-i \ne. GEN PL in o-stem = stem + -ov \nf. GEN PL in i-stem = stem + -ej \n \nIn order to show the result of the interaction of the rules of referral with the rules of \nexponence it is sufficient to look at the o-stem forms (5). In animate nouns, the rule of \nreferral in (3a) causes the form of the genitive to be extended to the accusative, while in \ninanimate nouns, the rule of referral in (3b) causes the form of the nominative to be extended \nto the accusative.  \n \n(5) animate o-stem    inanimate o-stem  \n NOM SG = stem + -\u00d8    NOM SG = stem + -\u00d8 \n ACC SG =      ACC SG =  \n GEN SG = stem + -a    GEN SG = stem + -a \n NOM PL = stem + -y    NOM SG = stem + -y \n ACC PL =      ACC SG =  \n GEN PL = stem + -ov    GEN SG = stem + -ov \n \nNow let us see how we might describe the same phenomenon without directional rules; as \nabove, it is sufficient to look solely at the o-stems. First, we can convert the rules of referral \nin (3) into the symmetrical classes \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 as in (6). In (7), these symmetrical rules \ndefine the syncretic forms.  \n \n(6) a. {NOM \u222a ACC} = X \nb. {GEN \u222a ACC} = Y  \n \n(7) a. X SG = stem + -\u00d8 \ng. Y SG in o-stem = stem + -a \nh. X PL = stem + -y\/-i \ni. Y PL in o-stem = stem + -ov \n \nObviously, this is an incomplete description, because nothing yet has been said about the \ncontrast between animates and inanimates. Since genitive\/accusative syncretism obtains only \nfor animates, one possibility would be to include this limitation in the definition of the \nsyncretic classes of values (8b). \n \n(8) revision of (6) \na. {NOM \u222a ACC} = X \nb. {GEN \u222a ACC} in animates = Y \n \nThese rules correctly define the animate paradigm (9a), with \u2018Y\u2019 taking precedence over \u2018X\u2019 \nin the accusative by P\u0101n\n\u0001\nini\u2019s principle (since the definition of \u2018Y\u2019 contains overt specification \nfor animacy, while \u2018X\u2019 is underspecified). But the undesired consequence of limiting \u2018Y\u2019 to \nanimates is to deny the inanimates their genitive form (9b).  \n                                               \n5\n See footnote 1 for the variation between -y and -i. Note that, for clarity of presentation, the syncretism between \ngenitive singular and nominative plural is not represented in the analysis. \n  \n8 \n \n \n(9) a. animate o-stem per (8)  b. inanimate o-stem per (8) \n NOM SG = stem + -\u00d8   NOM SG = stem + -\u00d8 \n ACC SG = stem + -a   ACC SG = stem + -\u00d8 \n GEN SG = stem + -a   GEN SG = not defined \n NOM PL = stem + -y   NOM PL = stem + -y \n ACC PL = stem + -ov   ACC PL = stem + -y \n GEN PL = stem + -ov   GEN PL = not defined \n \nThe forms associated with \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 need to be available to both animate and inanimate \nparadigms, so limiting their distribution according to animacy will not work. \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 \nmust interact with each other in such a way that they cancel each other out only in the \naccusative, that is, that portion of their range where they overlap. P\u0101n\n\u0001\nini\u2019s principle is not \noperative here, because neither rule is more specific than the other. The obvious option is to \nstipulate rule ordering, with the default ordering \u2018X\u2019 before \u2018Y\u2019, while animates have the \nordering \u2018Y\u2019 before \u2018X\u2019.  \n \n(10) a. default rule ordering  b. rule ordering for animates \n i. X      i.  Y  \nii. Y      ii.  X  \n \nThis arrangement will produce the correct set of forms. The difficulty arises when we reflect \non why we have considered this alternative analysis in the first place. Zwicky (2000) \nobserves that a model of morphology such as Stump\u2019s (2001), which contains both \nsymmetrical rules and directional rules, is more complex than one which contains only \nsymmetrical rules. However, as we have just seen, a model with only symmetrical rules must \nalso contain stipulated rule ordering to describe convergent bidirectional syncretism. \nStipulated rule ordering is itself a distinct formal device, one whose status as a component of \nmorphology remains at least as debatable as that of directional rules. They are absent, for \nexample, from approaches such as Stump\u2019s (2001) and Corbett and Fraser\u2019s (1993). Thus, we \nare left with a choice not between a more and less economical model of morphology, but \nbetween two models of equal complexity.6 \n \n \n3.2 FURTHER EXAMPLES OF CONVERGENT BIDIRECTIONAL SYNCRETISM. Accusative marking in \nRussian (and other Slavic languages) is the most familiar example of convergent bidirectional \n                                               \n6\n There is another possibility, namely to incorporate information about the lexical class within the set of \nsyncretic values (Jonathan Bobaljik, personal communication). For example, two symmetrical rules of the \nshape: \n {NOM \u222a ACC in inanimates} = X \n {GEN \u222a ACC in animates} = Y \nwould yield the correct forms, if substituted for (6).  \n This approach is problematic for two reasons. First, the classes indexed by X and Y contain both \nmorphosyntactic (case) and lexical (animate nouns versus inanimate) information. It is probably fair to say that \nthis would be an illegitimate move in most models of morphology, where one distinguishes between classes of \nmorphosyntactic values, and classes of lexemes (e.g. word class, inflection class). Second, it is not clear that \nsuch a representation is more than a notational variant of a directional rule, in that the classes encode an obvious \nasymmetry. For example, \u2018{NOM \u222a ACC in inanimates} = X\u2019 states that having form X is a general property of \nthe nominative wherever it occurs, and a contingent property of the accusative, restricted to a particular class of \nlexemes. In its own fashion, this suggests that form X is primarily a genitive form, and secondarily an accusative \nform.  \n  \n9 \n \nsyncretism; indeed, it seems to be the only one generally discussed within the literature. \nHowever, there are other paradigms that follow this pattern, and it is worth reviewing some \nexamples to see the variety of features that may be involved.  \nThe Daghestanian language Lak has what could be called the ergative equivalent of the \nRussian pattern (see Table 6, which shows merely a fragment of the large case paradigm). \nHere, rather than the accusative, it is the ergative whose form varies: in nouns, it has the \nending -l, characteristic of the distinct genitive in pronouns, while in pronouns, it has -\u00d8 (the \nbare stem), which characterizes the distinct absolutive of nouns. (Note that both nouns and \npronouns may display a stem alternation between the absolutive and other cases.) \n \n noun \n\u2018house\u2019 \npronoun \n\u2018I\u2019 \n     \nABS k\u2019atta-\u00d8 na-\u00d8  \nERG k\u2019atlu-l  na-\u00d8  \nGEN k\u2019atlu-l  ttu-l \nDAT k\u2019atlu-n  ttu-n \nSUPERESS k\u2019atlu-j   ttu-j \nCOMIT k\u2019atlu-\u0161\u0161a  ttu-\u0161\u0161a \n \nTABLE 6.

Gujarati person-number conjugation (Cardona and Suthar 2003: 682, 684) \n \n \n \n3.3 DIVERGENT BIDIRECTIONAL SYNCRETISM. As we have seen above, symmetrical rules can \nbe used to describe convergent directional syncretism only with the aid of an additional \nmorphological device, such as rule ordering. As for divergent bidirectional syncretism, \nsymmetrical rules simply cannot be used to describe it in any systematic fashion. Under \ndivergent bidirectional syncretism, there is a feature value x which takes the form associated \nwith feature value y in some contexts, while in other contexts y takes the form associated with \nx. For an illustration, we can return to the Latin example from  \nTable 4, adducing further data as shown in Table 9. In addition to the default masculine and \nneuter types of the second declension, there are a few nouns (the most prominent being \nvulgus \u2018crowd\u2019, v\u012brus, \u2018poison\u2019 and pelagus \u2018sea\u2019) which display an accusative in -us (Neue \nand Wagener 1902: 972).7 If we include these nouns in the picture, then the Latin second \ndeclension is not simply an example of unidirectional syncretism, but rather has two \nmirror-image patterns: in the default neuter type, the nominative looks like the accusative, \nand in the small class represented by vulgus, the accusative looks like the nominative.   \n \n                                               \n7\n The origin of this type is mixed. Pelagus is borrowed from the Greek s-stem pelagos, where -os is the final \npart of the stem, and not an inflectional ending. Clearly, however, when borrowed into Latin, it was interpreted \nas an ending, since pelagus was assigned to the second declension (with the ending -us), and not to the third \ndeclension s-stem type, where -us is instead the stem-final element (e.g. genus \u2018nation, race\u2019 and corpus \u2018body\u2019, \nwhere stem-final -s is realized as -r when followed by endings, as in the genitive singular forms gener-is, \ncorpor-is). This justifies the treatment of the -us in pelagus and the -us in servus as representing the same \nending. Other borrowings from Greek s-stems followed this pattern on occasion, such as c\u0113tus \u2018large sea animal, \nwhale\u2019 and chaus \u2018chaos\u2019 (Neue and Wagener 1902: 502-504). Vulgus and v\u012brus are native Latin items, and the \norigin of their exceptional declension is not known.  \n This type is also defective, lacking plural forms, except for the occasional pelag\u0113, whose ending is \ntransparently Greek, unincorporated into the Latin declensional system. All of these nouns show a tendency to \nbe reinterpreted as masculine nouns of the servus type, with nominative -us and accusative -um. One interesting \nvariation occurs in Late Latin (sixth century), where pelagus is reinterpreted as masculine without alterning its \ndeclension pattern: the example furentem pelagus \u2018raging sea\u2019 (from the Variae of Cassiodorus, cited in Neue \n(1902: 503)) has the agreeing participle with the non-syncretic masculine accusative ending -em. This shows \nthat nominative\/accusative syncretism in the singular was not necessarily tied to neuter gender. \n  \n11 \n \n default neuter  \n\u2018war\u2019 \ndefault masc. \n\u2018slave\u2019 \naccusative in  \n-us \u2018crowd\u2019 \n      \nNOM SG bell-um  serv-us vulg-us  \nACC SG bell-um  serv-um vulg-us  \nGEN SG bell-\u012b  serv-\u012b vulg-\u012b  \nDAT SG bell-\u014d  serv-\u014d vulg-\u014d \nABL SG bell-\u014d  serv-\u014d vulg-\u014d \n  \nTABLE 9. Latin second declension \n \nUsing directional rules, this sort of pattern does not differ in principle from unidirectional \nsyncretism. To the rules from (4) one simply adds a fourth rule (11d), stipulating that the \naccusative takes the form of the nominative for this small class. \n \n(11) a. NOM SG = stem + -us  \n b. ACC SG = stem + -um \n c. NOM SG in neuter = ACC  \n d. ACC SG in vulgus, pelagus & v\u012brus = NOM \n \nBut divergent bidirectional syncretism poses an insurmountable problem for symmetrical \nrules. Since both -um and -us are found with the syncretic value nominative\/accusative, they \nmust both be associated with the syncretic class of values {NOM SG \u222a ACC SG}, or at any rate, \nwith a class that includes these values. With the rules in (12) one can represent both the \nsyncretic forms, where \u2018X\u2019 stands for the -um of the neuters and \u2018Y\u2019 stands for the -us of the \nvulgus type.  \n \n(12) a. {NOM SG \u222a ACC SG} = X  \n b. X in neuter = stem + -um  \nc. {NOM SG \u222a ACC SG} = Y \nd. Y in vulgus, pelagus & v\u012brus = stem + -us    \n \nBut what about masculines, where both -us and -um are found? There is no way to include \nboth \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 in the same paradigm. In the Russian paradigms above, one could think in \nterms of rule ordering, since the domains of the two rules overlap only partially: if one rule \nprecedes the other, the non-overlapping portion still remains active. In this case the domains \nof the rules overlap completely, so either \u2018X\u2019 cancels out \u2018Y\u2019 completely, or vice versa. On a \nsymmetrical approach one would be forced to conclude that one of the forms in Table 9 is the \nresult of accidental homophony; for example, by assuming two endings, nominative -us1 and \nnominative\/accusative -us2. \n \n \n3.4. FURTHER EXAMPLES OF DIVERGENT BIDIRECTIONAL SYNCRETISM. So far, the only \nexamples which have been adduced in the literature are those found in Stump (2001), namely \nthe genitive singular\/nominative plural in Russian, the accusative\/dative singular in Old \nIcelandic and the first singular\/third plural in Romanian, which have been subject to criticism \n  \n12 \n \n(Feldstein 2003, Wunderlich forthcoming). However, there are examples beyond the Latin \none above which appear to be genuinely systematic. \nClassical Arabic has three cases: nominative, genitive and accusative (see Table 10). In \nthe default pattern (singulars and the broken plurals, which are formed by an alternation in \nthe vocalic\/syllabic pattern) all three cases have distinct endings: -u, -i and -a. In the so-called \nsound plurals (formed by suffixation), genitive and accusative are syncretic, marked by the \nending -i:, which corresponds to the distinct genitive of the default type.8 Diptotic nouns \n(certain adjectival stems, some broken plurals and some personal names) likewise have a \nsyncretic genitive\/accusative, but the ending is -a, corresponding to the distinct accusative of \nthe default type.9 The diptotic pattern is found only with indefinites; the definite form and the \nconstruct form (head of an adnominal construction) revert to the default pattern. (The dual \nlikewise displays genitive\/accusative syncretism, e.g. nominative dual, construct state \nmu\u2019min-a:, genitive\/accusative mu\u2019min-ay \u2018believers\u2019; these forms are distinct from those \nfound in the singular and plural, and so do not enter into a discussion of directional effects.) \n \n plural triptotic (default) pattern  diptotic \n \u2018believers.PL\u2019 \n(construct) \n\u2018believer\u2019 \n(construct) \n\u2018black one\u2019 \n(construct) \n \u2018black one\u2019 \n(indefinite) \n      \nNOM mu\u2019min-u: mu\u2019min-u \u2018aswad-u  \u2018aswad-u \nGEN mu\u2019min-i:  mu\u2019min-i \u2018aswad-i  \u2018aswad-a  \nACC mu\u2019min-i:  mu\u2019min-a \u2018aswad-a \u2018aswad-a  \n \nTABLE 10. Classical Arabic declension (Fischer 1997: 196) \n \nAs with the Latin example in Table 9, the analytical problem here is that, if we say that \nboth -i and -a are genitive\/accusative, how can the two endings be combined in a single \nparadigm, as occurs in the default type? Using directional rules, one could say that the \naccusative takes the form of the genitive in sound plurals, and that the genitive takes the form \nof the accusative in the diptotic type. \nIn the Pama-Nyungan language Diyari, dual and plural nouns and pronouns, and female \npersonal names, have an accusative ending -n5a which is distinct from the absolutive (see \nTable 11). In male personal names the ending -n5a is found in both the absolutive and \naccusative. A zero ending (the bare stem) is found in the ergative\/absolutive of non-singular \npronouns, the ergative of non-singular nouns, and the absolutive\/accusative of singular nouns. \n \n                                               \n8\n The singular endings are short and the plural endings long; the plural endings are assumed to derive, \nhistorically, from lengthening of the corresponding singular endings (Kienast 2001: 143).  \n9\n Altough it is not clear whether the -a of the diptotic type is etymologically connected with the -a of the default \ntype, at least some observers have argued that the two have been equated with each other. Kienast (2001: 142) \ncites Brockelmann\u2019s (1908-13) theory that the diptotic started among personal names: some names ended in -u \n(e.g. Iaz\u012bdu) and some in -a (e.g. \u0160ammara), and these were reinterpreted as fragments of the normal case \nparadigm, which was then fleshed out. Thus, this proposal assumes that the diptotic endings -u and -a were \netymologically distinct from the corresponding case endings -u and -a, but that at some later point a connection \nwas drawn between the two sets. \n  \n13 \n \n I II III IV V \n      \nERG  -(ya)li -li -\u00d8  -ndu -li \nABS -\u00d8  -\u00d8 -\u00d8  -ni -n\u032aa  \nACC -\u00d8  -n\u032aa -n \u032aa -n \u032aa -n\u032aa  \nLOC -n\u032ai -\u014bu -\u014bu -n \u032aa\u014bu -\u014bu \nALL -ya -\u014bu -\u014bu -n \u032aa\u014bu -\u014bu \nDAT -ya -n\n\u0003\ni -n\n\u0003\ni -n \u032aa\u014bka -n\n\u0005\ni \nABL -ndu -\u014bundu -\u014bundu -\u014bundu -\u014bundu \n \nI singular nouns \nII non-singular nouns, non-singular third person pronouns, \nsingular pronouns \nIII non-singular first and second person pronouns  \nIV female personal names, singular pronouns10 \nV male personal names \n \nTABLE 11. Diyari declension (Austin 1981: 47-50, 61) \n \nAs with the previous examples, the problem faced by symmetrical rules is posed by the \noverlapping range of the endings. The zero ending ranges across all three core cases \n(ergative, absolutive, accusative), while -n5a is found in both the absolutive and accusative. \nUsing symmetrical rules, one would associate {ERG \u222a ABS \u222a ACC} with -\u00d8 and {ABS \u222a ACC} \nwith  -n5a. Since the two rules overlap completely, they cannot be made to coexist within the \nsame paradigm, as occurs in type II. Again, directional rules are the only device that can give \n-\u00d8 and -n5a a unified representation across all of the paradigms. One possible analysis is to \nidentify -\u00d8 as the absolutive ending and -n5a as the accusative ending. In type I, the \naccusative takes the form of the absolutive, in type III, the ergative takes the form of the \nabsolutive, and in type V, the absolutive takes the form of the accusative.11 (In type IV a \ndistinct absolutive ending is found.) \n \n \n3.5 SYMMETRICAL VERSUS DIRECTIONAL RULES: A SUMMARY. Zwicky (2000) has argued that \nsymmetrical rules are sufficient to generate the surface effect of directionality, thus making \ndirectional rules unnecessary. However, we have seen that the rejection of directional rules \nbrings real consequences in the range of facts that can be described (further arguments may \nbe found in Evans et al. 2001, using somewhat different evidence). Although symmetrical \n                                               \n10\n Singular pronouns, besides the third person non-feminine, display this pattern in the ergative, absolutive and \naccusative, while in the remaining cases they behave like non-singular pronouns, with the element -ka- \npreceding the endings. The third person non-feminine behaves essentially like a non-singular noun, with \nergative n\u032aulu, absolutive na\u032awu, accusative ni\u032an \u032aa, and remaining cases based on the stem nu\u032a\u014bka- (Austin 1981: \n61). \n11\n A plausible alternative in this case would be to combine symmetrical and directional rules by viewing -\u00d8 as \nthe default core case ending. Types I-IV then follow a familiar split ergative~accusative pattern, with a distinct \nergative in some paradigms and a distinct accusative in others. In this case, only type V requires a directional \nrule. In either case, though, directional rules are required. \n  \n14 \n \nrules can describe unidirectional syncretism, convergent directional syncretism can only be \ndescribed by substituting another formal device (rule ordering), thus weakening the argument \nthat symmetrical rules entail greater formal economy. Divergent bidirectional syncretism \ncannot be described at all with symmetrical rules.  \nMore importantly, perhaps, the difference between symmetrical and directional rules may \nbe more superficial than has been claimed. With minimal alteration, the formalism used to \ndescribe symmetrical rules can be used to induce directionality. Consider the symmetrical \nanalysis of the Latin second declension given in (2), reproduced below as (13a-c). In the \nrevised version in (13a'-c'), all references to the index \u2018X\u2019 have been removed, and the ending \n-um is associated instead with the accusative singular.  \n \n(13) a. {NOM SG \u222a ACC SG} = X   a.'   {NOM SG \u222a ACC SG}   \n b. X = stem +-um    b.'     ACC SG = stem + -um \n c. NOM SG in masculine = stem + -us c.'    NOM SG in masculine = stem + -us\n  \nThe rules in (13b'-c') yield forms for all but the nominative singular of neuters, which \nremains undefined. However, in (13a') it is stipulated that nominative and accusative singular \nform a class, with the understanding that any rule that applies to the one value applies to the \nother as well, all else being equal. Although the neuter nominative is undefined, (13a') states \nthat it will behave in the same way as the accusative. The one assumption that must be made \nhere is that a defined form will take precedence over an undefined form. Thus, a rule of \nreferral, or its equivalent, is induced where a paradigmatic gap falls within a defined class of \nvalues. If one accepts this view of the underlying motivation for rules of referral, this \nstrengthens the case that symmetrical rules do not entail greater formal economy than \ndirectional rules.  \n \n \n3.6 RANKED CONSTRAINTS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO DIRECTIONAL SYNCRETISM. Alongside \nZwicky\u2019s (2000) discussion, the argument that directional effects can be derived without \nusing directional rules has come from the perspective of Optimality Theory (OT). The issue \nis addressed most directly by Wunderlich (forthcoming), who offers an OT alternative to \ndirectional rules. Most relevant is his treatment of what I have termed convergent syncretism, \nfor which he analyses the nominative\/accusative ~ genitive\/accusative alternation of Russian. \nFor the present purposes, it is sufficient to consider case alternation in the singular of o-stems \nand i-stems, as shown in Table 5 above. The feature values he proposes for the \nmorphosyntactic cases is given in (14). The nominative is simply unmarked. The other cases \nare rendered in terms of semantic roles: the accusative is [(+hr)v] (\u2018there is a higher role \n(verbal)\u2019), which expresses its subordinate role within a transitive verbal clause, while the \ngenitive is [(+hr)N] (\u2018there is a higher role (nominal)\u2019), which expresses its subordinate role \nwithin a nominal clause. \n \n(14) case name  feature value \n nominative  [  ] \n accusative  [(+hr)v] i.e. \u2018there is a higher role (verbal)\u2019 \n genitive   [(+hr)N] i.e. \u2018there is a higher role (nominal)\u2019 \n \nThe relevant case endings are given in (15). The i-stem genitive -i is fully specified in terms \nof the underlying morphosyntactic features. The o-stem ending -a is underspecified: the value \n[(+hr)], which omits reference to nominal or verbal contexts, represents genitive\/accusative \nsyncretically as a natural class. The default ending -\u00d8 has no feature specifications. \n  \n15 \n \n \n(15) o-stem      i-stem \n ending  feature value   ending  feature value \n -\u00d8  [  ]    -\u00d8  [  ] \n -a  [(+hr)]    -i  [(+hr)N] \n \nThe link between the underlying morphosyntactic features and the endings is effected by \nthree ranked constraints: \n \n\u2022 Compatibility: the categorical specification of input and output must match. That is, \ngenitive case (with a nominal specification) cannot be used where the input requires \naccusative case (with a verbal specification), and vice versa. \n\u2022 *(+hr)\/V inanimate: do not mark accusative case for inanimates. \n\u2022 Max (+hr): if the feature (+hr), common to the accusative and genitive, is present in the \ninput, it must be realized in the output. \n \nThe interaction of the above elements is shown in the tableaux in Table 12-Table 14. In \nanimate o-stems, the constraint Max (+hr) blocks the ending -\u00d8, because it is not specified \nfor (+hr), thus causing the genitive\/accusative to be selected. In the inanimate o-stems, \nhowever, the genitive\/accusative is blocked by the constraint *(+hr)\/V inanimate, so the \nunmarked nominative is selected, in spite of its violation of Max (+hr). In the animate \ni-stems, Compatibility blocks the use of the overtly genitive ending -i for the input \naccusative, so the nominative is selected; the issue of animacy does not even arise.12 \n \ninput: [(+hr)v], animate Compatibility *(+hr)\/V \ninanimate \nMax (+hr) \n      student-\u00d8   [  ]   *! \n\u0002  student-a [(+hr)]    \n \nTABLE 12.

Accusative of inanimate o-stem \n \n                                               \n12\n Note that this analysis only addresses the distribution of the endings, while the stem alternation between  \nmat\u2019- and mater\u2019- (see Table 5) remains unaccounted for. Since the stem mater\u2019- is not overtly genitive, it does \nnot violate Compatibility, so it is not clear what prevents an accusative form such as *mater\u2019-\u00d8. \n  \n16 \n \ninput: [(+hr)v], animate Compatibility *(+hr)\/V \ninanimate \nMax (+hr) \n\u0002   mat\u2019 [  ]   * \n       mater-i [(+hr)N] *!   \n \nTABLE 14. Accusative of animate i-stem \n \nTo the extent that the factual coverage is the same, the choice between this analysis and one \nwhich employs directional rules (e.g. Corbett and Fraser 1993) only has significance within \nthe context of the theoretical and descriptive program of the individual investigator.13 I limit \nmyself to assessing its formal properties. In effect, the analysis involves symmetrical rules \nplus rule ordering, as sketched above in (10); in this case, constraint ranking is the equivalent \nof rule ordering. The combination of lexical specifications and constraints state, in effect, that \na rule for genitive\/accusative precedes a rule for nominative\/accusative. Under certain \nconditions the genitive\/accusative rule is blocked, allowing the nominative\/accusative rule to \nbe first. Naturally, such a model can easily describe unidirectional syncretism as well. But, as \nI suggest above, it cannot describe divergent bidirectional syncretism. Wunderlich raises the \nissue but does not propose an analysis, instead rejecting one of Stump\u2019s (2001) examples of \ndivergent bidirectional syncretism. However, other examples could be offered in its place (as \n                                               \n13\n Wunderlich\u2019s (forthcoming) analysis of Russian is part of a larger model of the differential marking of objects \nand agents, whereby arguments high on the animacy\/prominence scale tend to mark the accusative, and \narguments low on this scale tend to mark the ergative. Whatever the cross-linguistic insights of this approach, it \nfails to capture some fairly striking generalizations that obtain within the languages actually under analysis. In \nthe Russian example, the genitive\/accusative syncretism displayed by the animate accusative is attributed to \nunderspecification of the ending, so it is, in effect, a lexical idiosyncrasy. But it is not just one ending which \nneeds to be underspecified, but rather seven (the four seen in Table 5, which are treated by Wunderlich, plus \nthree distinct adjectival and pronominal endings). This is why the animate accusative in Russian and other \nSlavic languages has long been used as an example of systematic syncretism, and particularly of directional \nrules (starting with Perlmutter and Ore\u0161nik 1973). The alternative as offered by Wunderlich is to treat the \nsevenfold repetition of this pattern as purely accidental \nA similar atomization results when we consider another of his proposals, namely that the constraint *(+hr)\/V \ninanimate can generally be used to account for the nominative\/accusative syncretism typical of Indo-European \nlanguages. Recall that this constraint blocks the use of the accusative ending for inanimates (\u2248 neuters), which \ninstead use the default form (informally, the nominative). But consider Latin once again. It is true that this \nanalysis is possible for the singular of some nouns of the third declension. The nominative singular of \nmasculines is the bare stem, and the accusative is the stem plus -em. In neuters, the nominative\/accusative is the \nbare stem, which could easily be described as the result of the omission of the accusative ending.  \n \n  masculine \n\u2018conqueror\u2019 \n neuter \n\u2018sea\u2019 \n NOM victor-\u00d8  aequor-\u00d8 \n ACC victor-em  aequor-\u00d8 \n GEN victor-is  aequor-is \n DAT victor-\u012b  aequor-\u012b \n ABL victor-e  aequor-e \n \nBut such an analysis cannot be applied to the second declension nouns described above in  \nTable 4. The neuter is distinguished from the masculine by the lack of the NOMINATIVE singular ending -us. \nUndoubtedly, this could be accounted for by some constraint, but, equally undoubtedly, this is not the same \nconstraint *(+hr)\/V inanimate found in the third declension, which blocks the accusative. Thus, the observation \nthat neuter nouns in Latin have nominative\/accusative syncretism is reduced to the concatenation of two \napparently unrelated facts.  \n  \n17 \n \nin \u00a73.4 above). Thus, the empirical problem created by divergent bidirectional syncretism \nremains. \nHowever, the difficulty caused by rejecting directional rules is not really a problem for \nWunderlich\u2019s model, since it in fact contains all the material needed to produce them, even \nthough this is not directly exploited. To demonstrate this, let us review some of the key points \nin the above analysis. The core of the morphological model consists of three elements: the \ninput (the morphosyntactic feature value), the output (the inflectional ending itself) and the \nMax constraint which mediates between them. In the accusative, the input is fully specified \n(accusative, i.e. [(+hr)v]), while the Max constraint is underspecified (genitive\/accusative, i.e. \n(+hr)). The behavior of the output form varies: in o-stems it is treated as underspecified, in \ni-stems it is treated as fully specified, as shown in (16). \n \n(16)   o-stems    i-stems \n input   [(+hr)v] is fully specified  [(+hr)v] is fully specified \n output   [(+hr)] is underspecified  [(+hr)v]  is fully specified \n Max  (+hr)  is underspecified  (+hr)    is underspecified \n \nHowever, this variation in the lexical specification of the output forms makes no difference in \nthe selection of the winning candidate. Both the underspecified output and the fully specified \noutput satisfy the underspecified Max constraint. Depending on whether the output is \nunderspecified or fully specified, the syncretism found in the animate accusative will be \nportrayed as symmetrical or directional. This is illustrated in    Table 15-   Table 16, which \ngenerically represent the animate accusative. The tableau in    Table 15 represents \nsymmetrical syncretism as effected through an underspecified output: there is a syncretic \ngenitive\/accusative form, which can be used for the accusative (this corresponds to the way \nthe tableaux in Table 12Table 13 work). The tableau in    Table 16 represents directional \nsyncretism as effected through a fully specified output: the genitive form can be used for the \naccusative (this corresponds to the way the tableau in Table 14 works). \n \ninput: ACC [(+hr)v] Max (+hr) \n NOM   [  ] *! \n\u0002   GEN\/ACC [(+hr)]  \n \n   TABLE 15. Tableau with underspecified output \n \ninput: ACC [(+hr)v] Max (+hr) \n NOM   [  ] *! \n\u0002   GEN [(+hr)N]  \n \n   TABLE 16. Tableau with fully specified output \n \nIn effect, the tableau in    Table 16 is the OT equivalent of the directional model outlined \nabove in (13): the Max constraint defines the syncretic class of values, while the absence of a \ndistinct accusative in the output produces the paradigmatic gap. The effects of this directional \nrule do not surface in Wunderlich\u2019s analysis  because they are blocked by a higher ranking \nconstraint (Compatibility), which bars the use of the genitive for the accusative. But \ndirectional rules are nonetheless built into the analysis, and indeed are implied wherever a \nfully-specified output interacts with an underspecified Max constraint. Thus, Wunderlich\u2019s \n  \n18 \n \nmodel cannot be seen as offering an alternative to directional rules, because it already \ncontains them. \n \n \n4. (UN)NATURAL CLASSES. It is often assumed that syncretism can be taken to reflect natural \nclasses of feature values. Jakobson (1936) was the first to formalize this view, which was \nthen adapted to generative grammar by Bierwisch (1967); more recent treatments include \nCalabrese (1998), Noyer (1997, 1998) and M\u00fcller (forthcoming).  \n As an example of such an approach, we might take the Gujarati paradigm given in \nTable 8, and analyze the person values in terms of component subvalues which define natural \nclasses. \n \n(17)   feature value  underlying subvalues \n first person  [+1, -3] \n second person  [-1, -3] \n third person  [-1, +3] \n \nWe could then characterize the first\/second and second\/third person syncretism as reflecting \nthe underlying structure of the feature \u2018person\u2019. First\/second person syncretism is [-3] (which \nwe could give some name such as \u2018discourse participant\u2019), while second\/third person \nsyncretism is [-1] (which we might call \u2018non-speaker\u2019). This would free us of the need to \nstipulate which values are syncretic. Whatever the purely formal advantages of such an \napproach, the most important question is whether it can account for all the relevant data. \nUnfortunately, this is not a question that can be easily assessed in general terms. Wildly \ndifferent models of feature structure are in circulation, which differ not only in their structural \nproperties, but also in the repertoire of feature values they employ. Each makes different \npredictions, and I do not propose to survey them.14 It is sufficient to show two examples of \nsyncretic patterns which are clearly systematic, and which involve morphosyntactic values so \nremote from each other that any account in terms of natural classes would void the notion of \nany explanatory value.  \nHansson (1996) describes syncretism of the comitative singular and locative plural in \nNorth Sami. In the more conservative Western Finnmark dialects, this pattern is found in \nnouns only (Table 17), while pronouns have two distinct forms (Table 18). However, in the \nEastern Finnmark dialects, this syncretic pattern has been extended to pronouns as well, \nthrough extension of the comitative singular form to the locative plural.  \n \n                                               \n14\n Support for the validity of a particular model of feature structure, and for such an approach in general, might \nbe found if they yielded valid cross-linguistic generalizations. The only attempt I am aware of to do so against a \ncontrolled sample of languages is Harley and Ritter (2002). These predictions do not appear to be borne out (for \ndetails, see Baerman (forthcoming)). \n \n  \n19 \n \n SG  PL \nNOM \u010dalbmi  \u010dalmmi-t \nACC\/GEN \u010dalmmi  \u010dalmmi-id \nILL \u010dalbm\u00e1-i  \u010dalmmi-de \nLOC \u010dalmmi-s  \u010dalmmi-in  \nCOM \u010dalmmi-in  \u010dalmmi-iguin \nESS \u010dalbmi-n  \u010dalbmi-n \n \nTABLE 17.

North Sami pronoun declension, \u2018who\u2019 (Hansson 1996: 16) \n \nThis morphological innovation demonstrates that comitative singular\/locative plural \nsyncretism is systematic in the Eastern Finnmark dialects, at least at the moment the change \noccurred. It is unlikely that any model of feature structure could plausibly represent these two \nparadigmatic cells as being a natural class. The one option would be to treat -inna as a fully \nunderspecified ending, which could be inserted in any paradigmatic cell. However, there are \nno independent reasons to believe that -inna is the default case-number ending. \nThe Cushitic language Dhaasanac displays a complex pattern of person and number \nsyncretism in its verbal subject person markers, described by Tosco (2001: 123-206). In the \ntense\/aspect paradigms where person is marked (the perfect and imperfect positive, the \ndependent positive and the short past) there are two distinct forms, which Tosco (2001) labels \n\u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019, following Sasse (1976). The A form is used for the first person singular, third \nperson singular masculine, first person inclusive plural and the third person plural, while \nform B is used for the second person in both numbers, third person singular feminine and the \nfirst person exclusive plural (see Table 19a). The contrast between the A and B forms is \nillustrated in Table 19b. It takes a number of different shapes, depending on the verb stem, \ninvolving stem-final (a-e) or stem-initial (f) consonant alternations and vowel insertion (c) \nand alternation (d-e).  \n \n  \n20 \n \na.

Dhaasanac verb paradigm b. examples of A ~ B alternation \n \nTABLE 19 \n \nThe variety of morphological processes associated with the A ~ B alternation leaves little \ndoubt as to its systematicity, but how can we characterize the sets of person\/number\/gender \nvalues that the two forms encode? Part of the problem might be circumvented by construing \nthe A form (which Tosco treats as the morphological base) as completely underspecified for \nagreement features. But the B form must still be accounted for, and there is no plausible \nmodel of person-number-gender features that would unite these values as a natural class.  \nThese examples show the need for unnatural (morphologically stipulated) classes of \nmorphosyntactic values. This is not an argument against natural classes as such. However, \nonce unnatural classes are admitted, they can freely substitute for natural classes. That being \nthe case, the choice between one or the other interpretation becomes a matter of personal \npreference, thereby weakening the notion that natural classes impose any necessary \nconstraints on morphological behavior. \n \n \n4. CONCLUSION. Directional rules and unnatural classes are problematic notions within \nlinguistics, since they involve the overt stipulation of relationships between morphological \nobjects, relationships which are independent of the morphosyntactic function that underlies \nthem. The rejection of these concepts is motivated by the desire for a simpler model of \ngrammar, the argument being that they make no significant contribution to the range of facts \nthat can be described. However, they do, as the examples above show. The purpose of the \npresent paper has been to demonstrate that these and similar examples should be allowed to \ninform our model of morphology. This is not to claim that all apparent instances of \nsyncretism must necessarily be treated as morphologically systematic, but rather that such an \ninterpretation should always be available, to be considered on its individual merits rather than \nexcluded a priori. A formal model which instead dismisses certain phenomena from the \noutset can only be a poor representation of linguistic reality. \nDo these considerations mean that we require three distinct devices (natural classes, \nunnatural classes and directional rules) to describe syncretism, as argued by Stump (2001)? \nThe more pertinent question might well be: can we avoid these three devices? In \u00a73.5 and \n\u00a73.6 I argued that a model which allows classes of morphosyntactic values already contains \nthe necessary material for generating directional rules. In \u00a74 I argued that unnatural classes of \nvalues must be allowed, thus making the notion of natural classes optional. Nevertheless, \nnatural classes of some sort are convenient and attractive, and it is unlikely that many \nlinguists would want to dispense with them completely. Nor can they be said to do any harm. \nThis leads us back to Stump\u2019s (2001) three devices for describing syncretism, or some \n  \n21 \n \nnotional equivalent thereof (for example, the constraint-based approach of Wunderlich \n(forthcoming)). The syncretic patterns we have looked at here suggest that morphological \nstructure is, at least in some degree, independent of meaning, as argued by Aronoff (1994), \nCorbett and Fraser (1993) and Stump (2001), among others. \n \n \n \n \nREFERENCES \nAnttila , Raimo. 1972.
