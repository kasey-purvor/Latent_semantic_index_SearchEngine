It has\na single subpolar flagellum, which propels the cell\nforward, rotating only clockwise. When the flagellar\nmotor stops, the functional helix relaxes to a short\nwavelength, large amplitude structure and Brownian\nmotion appears to cause reorientation of the cell body\nas described by Armitage and Macnab (1987). When\nthe motor starts to rotate again, a functional helix re-\nforms and the cell swims in a new direction. Bacterial\nmotion usually can be described as a random walk with\na good approximation (Schnitzer et al., 1991). From\nthe mathematical point of view it is often assumed that\ntimes of runs and stops are distributed exponentially.\nA wide range of phenomena occur when a signalling\ncue is non-uniformly distributed in space and\/or time.\n0303-2647\/$ \u2013 see front matter \u00a9 2003 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.\ndoi:10.1016\/S0303-2647(03)00109-6\n52 A.A. Chernova et al. \/ BioSystems 71 (2003) 51\u201359\nSuch stimuli can lead to directed or biased motion of\ncells, i.e. can cause a tactic response. This study is\na step towards understanding the physical nature of\ntaxis in bacteria subjected to changes in chemoattrac-\ntant concentration. We start with a description of the\nexperiment and analysis of data and then present re-\nsults of fitting times of runs and stops with a general-\nisation of the exponential distribution.\n2. Description of the experimental setup\nWe are exploiting data for temporal sensing in\nR. sphaeroides, which has been investigated using\ntethered cells and stepwise changes in the concen-\ntration of proprionate. The data were collected by\nH. Packer (Microbiology Unit, Department of Bio-\nchemistry, Oxford University).\n2.1. Growth conditions\nR. sphaeroides WS8N (a wild type nalidixic acid\nresistant strain) was grown at 30 \u25e6C aerobically in the\ndark as described by Ingham and Armitage (1987).\n2.2. Tethering\nIn order to analyse the behaviour of individual bac-\nterial flagellar motors, cells were tethered by their flag-\nella using antiflagellar antibody in a flow chamber and\nthe behaviour of individual motors was analysed us-\ning motion analysis. Cells were harvested by gentle\ncentrifugation, washed and resuspended in nitrogen\n10 mM Na HEPES buffer (pH 7.2) containing 50 g\/ml\nof chloramphenicol, aerated by shaking at 30 \u25e6C. The\ncells were starved for 45 min and tethered in the flow\nchamber as described by Berg and Block (1984) and\nby Packer et al. (1996).\n2.3. Motion analysis\nThe tethered cells were viewed via a phase-contrast\nmicroscope with an attached video camera. Measure-\nment of cell rotation was made using the AROT7 soft-\nware on a Bactracker. The software can analyse up\nto 10 cells per field. Cells that were rotating with-\nout touching others were measured. Data points were\ntaken at the video frame rate (50 Hz for interlaced im-\nages) and the raw data were downloaded as ASCII\nfiles for analysis.\nTethered cells were subject to stepwise addition of\npropionate at the 12 levels with concentrations from\n1 nM to 25 mM (i.e. from sub-saturating to saturating\nconcentrations) over 3\u20135 min time interval.\n3. Data analysis\nDuring the experiment rotation speed of a single\ntethered cell was recorded every 0.02 s. Typical time\nseries of responses are shown in Fig. 1. The raw ASCII\ndata files were processed to eliminate system noise,\neach point in the curve was replaced by the weighted\naverage of its nearest nine neighbours by the method\nof Savitzky\u2013Golay described by Savitzky and Golay\n(1964). An advantage of this filter is its sensitivity,\nso that subtle changes in bacterial motor dynamics\nare preserved in the data. The noise arising due to\nvibrational forces acting on a stopped cell must be\ntreated separately.\nA typical distribution of rotation speed data\n(pre-stimulus period) is shown in Fig. 2. The distri-\nbution is bimodal. The first peak around zero corre-\nsponds to stops of the motor; the negative values of\nthe rotation speed appear when the cell, subject to\nvibrational forces, turns in the opposite direction. Vi-\nbrational forces contribute in a different manner to the\ndistribution of speeds around the second maximum.\nA physical reason for this is the small value of the\nReynold\u2019s number for a bacterium in liquid medium,\nwhich means that a moving cell is surrounded by a\nrelatively more stable environment than a stopped\none. The complexity of the frequency distribution of\nthe rotation speed of a moving R. sphaeroides cell\nreflects the intricate behaviour of the bacterial motor.\nIn comparison with the virtually constant-speed mo-\ntor of Escherichia coli, in R. sphaeroides, the motor\nis known to be a variable-speed motor and the speed\nvariation can be seen both in individual motors and\nbetween cells under the same external conditions.\nMore detail on the stop\/start mechanism of the motor\nin R. sphaeroides is given in the paper by Packer et al.\n(1997).\nFor each cell the pre-stimulus records were used to\ndefine a threshold value of rotation speed. From the\ndistributions of the rotation speed data we determined\nA.A. Chernova et al. \/ BioSystems 71 (2003) 51\u201359 53\nFig. 1. Experimental measurements of rotation speed of a single tethered R. sphaeroides cell. Vertical lines show the time intervals during\nwhich propionate was applied. Outside these regions the propionate concentration is zero. A delay is observed between the application of\npropionate and beginning of response. Duration of the delay differs from cell to cell. This part of data was not included in the analysis.\nData from 1\u0001M, 100\u0001M and 1 mM experiments (unpublished data).\nthe two most frequent values (modes); the threshold\n\u03c90 was chosen to be half of the maximal modal speed\n(Fig. 2). The cell was considered as stopped at time t if\nthe detected rotation speed \u03c9(t) was less than \u03c90, oth-\nerwise the cell was assumed to be rotating (running).\n4. Distributions of run and stop times\nImplementing the threshold criteria for the rotation\nspeed data, we obtain sequences of run and stop times\nfor each cell. We computed mean values and standard\n54 A.A. Chernova et al. \/ BioSystems 71 (2003) 51\u201359\nFig. 2.

The threshold level was chosen to be one-half of the largest modal rotation speed.\ndeviations of run and stop times averaged over all the\ncells in one experiment (i.e. subjected to the same level\nof propionate) versus the concentration of propionate.\nRelative mean durations of runs and stops, defined as\ndifferences between mean duration of runs (stops) in\nthe presence of the nutrient and mean duration of runs\n(stops) over pre-stimulus period, are shown in Fig. 3.\nIt was found that on the average the mean duration of\nruns remains approximately constant for cells which\nare subject to stepwise changes in propionate concen-\ntration from zero level to some n1, n1 < 1\u0001M. The\nstepwise changes from 0 to some value n2, 1\u0001M <\nn2 < 10 mM, cause an increase in the mean time of\nruns, while as a result of the stepwise changes from\n0 to n3, n3 > 10 mM, the mean duration of runs de-\ncreases.\nThe mean duration of stops was not observed to\nchange significantly in response to stepwise addi-\ntion of propionate at the concentrations from 1 nM\nto 500\u0001M. When the change was from 0 to some\nconcentration n4, n4 > 500\u0001M, the average duration\nof stops increased, but the increase was not larger\nthan 1 s.\nFig. 4 illustrates how a single cell responds to step-\nwise addition and the following new constant level of\nthe nutrient (here form zero (background) concentra-\ntion to 1 mM): the cell tends to stop less frequently\n(the first mode disappears from the distribution of ro-\ntation speeds); duration of runs increases (up to four\ntimes in this instance) there are less long stops than at\nthe background level.\n4.1. Fitting with the Weibull distribution function\nIn traditional modelling of bacterial motion it is\noften assumed that the temporal part of the random\nwalk can be described by a Poisson process, or, more\ngenerally, alternating renewal process with exponen-\ntial holding times, i.e. waiting times between runs are\ndistributed exponentially (see, for example, papers by\nBerg (2000) and Othmer and Hillen (2002)). Here we\nattempt to justify this assumption by analysing distri-\nbutions of both run and stop times obtained from the\ndata.\nDistributions of run and stop times derived from the\ndata were fitted with a Weibull distribution function,\nA.A.

An\nexample of fitting data for a single cell is presented\nin Fig. 5. The cumulative distribution function (cdf)\ncalculated from data was converted into a form suitable\nfor linear fitting with Eq. (4).\n5. Results\nFigs. 6 and 7 show the parameters \u03b7 and \u03b2 estimated\nfor each cell in all the experiments. As can be seen\nfrom the Weibull parameter estimation, there is a sig-\nnificant variability in the cell behaviour. 97.7% of all\n\u03b7 values lie within the range from 0 to 12, and two val-\nues were found to be 65.04 (for run times, 25 mM pro-\npionate) and 223.20 (stop times, 25 mM propionate,\ndifferent cell).\nThe second parameter, \u03b2, significantly deviates from\nunity for both run and stop times before and after\naddition of nutrient.\nOne of the possible conclusions from analysis of\nnorm of residuals of the fits is that the Weibull distri-\nbution is a better description for stop times (both in\nthe pre-stimulus period and after change in the chem-\nical concentration) than for run times.\nThe results of the analysis of run and stop times\ndo not allow us to draw a single conclusion from the\ndata, mainly due to a great diversity in individual cells\u2019\nbehaviour. Cases of successful fitting of a run\/stop\ndistribution with Weibull functions are found as often\n56 A.A. Chernova et al. \/ BioSystems 71 (2003) 51\u201359\nFig. 4.

For the three smallest concentration we used the same pre-stimulus segment of the dataset.\nsequences of run and stop times does not differ signif-\nicantly from the autocorrelation function of a Poisson\nprocess.\nThese complexities discovered in the data sug-\ngest that a detailed investigation into the run and\nstop times distributions can produce some interest-\ning results. We have chosen the Weibull distribution\nfunction as a simplest generalisation of the exponen-\ntial distribution. Such generalisation leads, in fact, to\nre-consideration of several modelling hypotheses for\nchemotaxis in bacteria. Experimental motivation of\nthe generalisation and modification of the temporal\nand spatio-temporal models is a subject of our current\nresearch.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank Dr. T.
