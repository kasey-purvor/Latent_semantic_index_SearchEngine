The field-induced FE phase would\nrevert back into its original state when the applied field is below a coercive field of\nEFE-AF, releasing all of their polarization charges in a few nanoseconds,1 which\nfacilitates the microelectronic devices operated at a very high speed. In most cases,\nEAF-FE is extremely high in thin films that require a high voltage-power supply for the\ndevice operation. With the development of present thin-film deposition technologies,\nthe operating voltage can be greatly reduced when the film thickness is reduced.\nHowever, the vertical shrinkage of film thickness would result in the size effect: the\nfilms become a ferroelectric below a critical thickness. In general, the critical film\nthickness depends on the type of material as well as the fabrication technique, for\nexample the critical thickness is around 400 nm for PbZrO3 films made by\npulsed-laser deposition and 210 nm for Pb0.97La0.02(Zr0.85Sn0.13Ti0.02)O3 by sol-gel\nprocessing.6-7 The fundamental understanding of the size effect is necessary for the\noptimization of film fabrication, which is otherwise different from that on the\nlong-range coupling of ferroelectricity to occur at a much smaller size.8\nAn alternative way to reduce EAF-FE is to alter the PbZrO3 composition in the\nphase diagram, such as the partial replacement of Zr by Sn in\nPb0.97La0.02(Zr0.65Sn0.22Ti0.13)3 ceramics.3 However, the field-induced FE phase is\nstable over the experimental period even after removal of the external field and\nexhibits a slow relaxation mechanism at room temperature. The slow relaxation\n3kinetics is reminiscent of the domain backswitching in epitaxial ferroelectric thin\nfilms where the domains are preferentially orientated after the application of an\nelectrical field.9-10 After the specimen is heated, the relaxation process into the\nantiferroelectric is accelerated, as evidenced from observations of transmission\nelectron microscopy (TEM) micrographs.3 The mechanisms responsible for the slow\nrelaxation are currently unclear due to the limited amount of data, especially in\nantiferroelectric thin films.\nIn this letter, the AF-FE phase switching was examined. A charge injection model\nis used to show the FE-to-AF relaxation behavior.\nIn this study, a sol-gel spin coating technique was used to deposit antiferroelectric\nPb(Zr0.95Ti0.05)O3 and Pb0.99Nb0.02(Zr0.84Sn0.12Ti0.04)0.98O3 (PNZST) thin films onto\nPt\/Ti\/SiO2\/Si substrates. The details of the fabrication of Pb(Zr0.95Ti0.05)O3 thin films\nhave previously been described in Ref. 4. For the PNZST thin films, lead acetate\ntrihydrate was dissolved in acetic acid and refluxed for 2h. Zirconium propoxide,\ntitanium butoxide, tin acetate and niobium ethoxide were mixed and dissolved in\nacetic acid and 2-methoxyethanol in a separate flask. The two solutions were then\nmixed at room temperature and refluxed for 3 h. De-ionized water and ethylene glycol\nwere then added to control the viscosity and cracking of the films. The final\nconcentration of the solution was 0.3 M. A layer was spin coated onto a substrate at\n4000 rpm. The deposited layer was initially heated to 300 \u00baC for 30 s and then\nannealed at 600 \u00baC for 10 min. The deposition procedure was repeated until the\nrequired film thickness was reached. Top electrodes of Cr\/Au were vacuum\n4evaporated onto the films, and the electrodes were patterned into 60 \uf06dm \uf0b4 60 \uf06dm\nsquares using photo-resist lift-off processing and wet chemical etching. All the films\nshowed good crystallinity and perovskite structure, when examined using X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) patterns (data not shown). A Keithley 3402 waveform generator\nwas used to supply various function-step voltage pulse sequences with a rise time of 5\nns, which allowed a variable pulse delay through two-channel configurations. The\ncharge density of the domain forward\/backward switching under\/after the applied\nvoltage Vappl, denoted as PFSW\/PNSW, was analyzed through charge integration of\ntime-dependent transient current across the film in series with a loading resistor of RL\n= 50 \uf057 monitored by an LeCroy WR 6200A oscilloscope. Each measurement was an\naverage of 10 readings. P-E hysteresis loops were performed on a RT66A Radiant\ntester with a triangular wave form of 1 kHz.\n-600 -400 -200 0 200 400 600\n-45\n-30\n-15\n0\n15\n30\n45\nP\nol\nar\niz\nat\nio\nn\n(\uf06d\nC\n\/c\nm\n2 )\nE (kV\/cm)\n90 nm\n150 nm\nFIG. 1. P-E hysteresis loops for PNZST with different film thicknesses\n5Fig.1 shows the P-E hysteresis loops for PNZST thin films with different\nthicknesses. The coercive field EAF-FE for a typical Pb(Zr0.95Ti0.05)O3 film4 is on the\norder of 500 kV\/cm, which is reduced to ~200 kV\/cm for a 150 nm-thick PNZST film\ndue to ionic replacement here. The loop appears similar to that from other\nferroelectric material in agreement with previous reports.3, 11 As the film thickness is\nreduced to 90 nm, the loop at negative fields on the top electrode remains, but half of\nthe loop at positive fields is lost, as shown in Fig. 1. This indicates that the\n\u201cferroelectric\u201d domains driven by EFE-AF have a preferred orientation pointing to the\ntop electrode.\n10-7 10-6 10-5 10-4 10-3 10-2 10-1 100\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n-8.0 V\n-6.0 V\n-5.0 V\n-4.0 V\n\uf074\n3\n\uf074\n2\n\uf074\n1\n2P\nr\n(\uf06d\nC\n\/c\nm\n2 )\nt (s)\nt\nFIG. 2.

The pulse width is\n100 ns. The solid lines are the best fitting of the data according to Eq. _5_.\nFigure 2 shows the time dependence of the remanent polarization 2Pr(t) = |PFSW(t)| -\n|PBSW(t)| after a negative-negative pulse sequence with different Vappl. 2Pr(t) values\nincreases with the increase of either relaxation time t or |Vappl|. The time evolution of\n2Pr at each Vappl is characterized by multiple steps, implying that there are several\nrelaxation mechanisms. As the polarity of the pulses in the sequence are firstly\npositive and then negative, 2Pr is nearly constant with time, as shown in Fig. 3, but it\ndecays with time to show the same relaxations as those in Fig. 2 under a reversed\npulse sequence. This supports the preferred domain orientation after Vappl.\nWhen the above pulse sequences are applied on a 350 nm-thick Pb(Zr0.95Ti0.05)O3\nthin film, both |PFSW| and |PBSW| are nearly constant in the time range of 100 ns \u2013100\nms with almost zero remanent polarization. This suggests that in physical nature,\n7phase switching from FE to AF can be fast, and that the slow restoration of an\nantiferroelectric phase in the films is attributed to additional factors, such as the size\neffect and film heterogeneity arising from regional defect accumulation, strain-field\ndistribution, phase segregation, and interfacial passive layers.6-7,12-13 The generic size\neffect in antiferroelectric thin films can cause: (1) the gradual increase of the remanent\npolarization with the decrease of the film thickness,7 and (2) the abrupt transformation\ninto a ferroelectric at below a critical film thickness.6, 14 In our work asymmetric\nphase switching under positive and negative fields is exceptional and still under\ninvestigation. It is suggested that the preferable defect accumulation at one side of the\nfilm eliminates the reverse domain nucleation and thus inhibits AF-to-FE phase\nswitching at positive fields. Nevertheless, the size effect can not explain the slow\nrelaxation of polarization reversal, since the same phenomenon can occur in bulk\nceramics.3\nAs a reasonable assumption, the regional heterogeneous nature of the film can\naffect local electrical parameters of polarization (Pi), dielectric permittivity (\uf065i), and\nconductivity (\uf073i) in an elementary region (i) with the thickness (di) that causes charge\naccumulation at the interface under Vappl.

The injected charges under Vappl can not only compensate for the\nlocal driving field EFE-AF in prohibiting domain backswitching but also cause pinning\nof domain walls.15 After the removal of Vappl, the injected charges can be smoothed\nout of the film and then - EFE-AF for domain-wall motion is restored. The process is\n9characterized by a relaxation time (t1) that is dependent on the regional dielectric\nconstant, conductivity and thickness. Figure 4 shows PFSW and PBSW profiles for\nPb(Zr0.95Ti0.05)O3 thin films after negative field stressing for different times. Their\nabsolute values both decrease with a prolonged time until leveling off at a\ncharacteristic time, t1. However, their polarizations are completely restored after a\nprogrammed 1 second relaxation period. The solid lines of best fits of the data in Fig.\n4 yield t1 = 3.18 \uf06ds, where polarization reduction is assumed to be proportional to the\ninjected charge density.\nIt is expected that the heterogeneous regions would be enhanced in doped PNZST\nthin films, due to the increase of defect centers by ionic replacements, and the\nrelaxation time would change from region to region with regard to the electrical\nparametric variation. The total injected charge density under Vappl would be\n( ) ( )i\ni\nq t q t\uf03d\uf0e5 . (5)\nThe line of best fit suggests that either polarization increase in Fig. 2 or reduction in\nFig. 3 is proportional to the total charges. Three discrete relaxation times in the\nspectra are clearly identified to be t1 = 2.31 \uf06ds, t2 = 29.7 \uf06ds and t3 = 2.23 ms at |Vappl| =\n8.0 V in our experimental range, which all slightly decrease when the |Vappl| is\nreduced.This can be understood from the nature of the field-dependent \uf065i and \uf073i in a\nnonlinear dielectric material. With the charges smoothed out of the film after Vappl, the\nlocal driving force EFE-AF is restored for the reverse domain nucleation with an area\nfraction of \uf028 \uf029( ) 1 exp( \/ )i i ip t t E\uf074\uf03d \uf02d \uf02d .16 If <\uf074i(Ei)> > ti, the polarization relaxation\ncan be more accurately described by a pre-exponential formula, such as in epitaxial\n10\nferroelectric Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 thin films,9-10 due to the consideration of nucleation-limited\ndomain switching in a low dimensional system with an effective Hausdorff\ndimensionality of d = 2.5.17-18\nIn summary, the coercive field in antiferroelectric Pb(Zr0.95Ti0.05)O3 thin films can\nbe reduced by doping with Nb and Sn ions. However, a double P-E hysteresis loop\nwould lose its positive branch as the film thickness is below 90 nm due to the size\neffect, and the remaining part exhibits a preferred \u201cferroelectric\u201d domain orientation\ndriven by EFE-AF. The relaxation times of domain backswitching are multiple in the\nrange of 100 ns to 100 ms, reminiscent of its slow behavior in the bulk,3 but fast into\nthe order of a few nanoseconds in the film without dopants. It is believed that the\nlocal-field rejuvenation after injected charge compensation for EFE-AF is essential for\nmultiple polarization relaxations in the film consisting of elementary regions with\ndifferent electrical parameters.\nAcknowledgement This work is supported by Climbing Mountain Plan of Shanghai\nin Project No. 06JC14006 and NCETFDU.
