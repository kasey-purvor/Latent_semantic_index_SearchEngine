This requires \nan acceptance of the complexity of the work, the essential role of professional \njudgment, and the need for feedback loops in the system where lower level workers \nare not afraid to communicate honestly about their experiences, both good and bad, \nand senior managers treat their feedback as a valuable source of learning.   It is argued \nthat current strategies to manage risk in child protection are, paradoxically, making it \nharder for professionals to learn how to protect children better.  Three factors are \nidentified as combining in such a way that they promote a culture in which \nprofessional practice is being excessively controlled and proceduralised: the person-\ncentred approach to investigating child deaths, the blame culture, and the performance \nmanagement system.  The way they reduce the opportunities for learning are \nexplored.   \n \nKey words:  child protection, complex systems, errors, organisational learning \n \n Introduction \nReducing the incidence of child maltreatment is a key policy aim in most countries.  \nIn developed nations, sophisticated systems of child welfare and child protection have \nbeen implemented. However, in many countries and states there have been recent high \nprofile, critical reviews of performance (e.g. the Royal Commission on child \nprotection in New South Wales, Australia (Woods Commission, 2008); the \nindependent review of child protection services in British Columbia, Canada (Hughes, \n2006); and the progress report on child protection in England (Laming, 2009).  There \nis public concern that, despite intensive effort and considerable investment, there has \nbeen insufficient improvement.  Child deaths from maltreatment are the extreme \nevidence of failure and public reaction is harsh when, with hindsight, it looks as if \nthey could and should have been prevented by professionals. \n \nThis article argues for a systems approach to learning how to improve performance, \nan approach that takes as a fundamental assumption that \u2018to make sense of the \ncomplexity of the world, we need to look at it in terms of wholes and relationships \nrather than splitting it down into its parts and looking at each in isolation\u2019 (Ramage & \nShipp, 2009 p.1).   Child protection services are conceptualised as complex adaptive \nsystems.  The \u2018complex\u2019 part of the label refers to the nature of causality within the \nsystem \u2013 to nonlinear dynamics  which limit the predictability of actions so that the \nsystem should not be seen as a machine where, once the correct causes are put in \nmotion, all will proceed in a precise and predictable way.  The \u2018adaptive\u2019 part of the \nlabel follows on from this - a system needs to be able to receive feedback about what \nis happening to self-regulate, i.e. adapt its behaviour in the light of this learning.   \n The systems approach offers a potentially fruitful way of reducing risk to children of \ninaccurate assessments and ineffective interventions through improved organisational \nlearning but it requires some radical changes in the way that services currently \noperate.   In outlining how it would operate, the obstacles to such a reform become \napparent, obstacles that have, ironically, arisen from attempts to improve performance \ninteracting in such a way that the cumulative effect is negative.  The responses to \npublic criticism combined with the person-centred approach to investigating tragedies \nand managerialism have contributed to creating a very controlled and proceduralised \nworkforce that mitigates against learning and adapting in response to new \ninformation. \n \nThe focus in this article is specifically on the English system but the argument will be \napplicable, in varying degrees, to other countries.  The issue of blame has been \nsignificant in the other countries of the UK, the US, Canada, Australia and New \nZealand.  Mainland European countries, which tend to have a more generous welfare \napproach to supporting families, have seemed to avoid a high level of public \ncondemnation of professionals when children die (Hetherington, Cooper, Smith, & \nWilford, 1997) but recent high profile cases in the Netherlands and Germany raise the \nquestion whether a more blaming approach may be developing (Kindler, 2008).  All \nof these countries, however, share with England a move to \u2018New Public Management\u2019 \nin public sector services and this, it will be argued, is one of the contributory factors \nto the current problems.  \n \nLarge-scale empirical studies have a major role to play in improving our knowledge \nof how to recognise abuse and which interventions are effective.  However, this \narticle is concerned with organisations\u2019 ability to learn about and improve their own \nperformance.  \nA systems approach to learning  \nViewing organisations involved in providing a child protection service as systems will \nbe familiar to many readers since the concept of system has long been used in \ntheorising about families.  A system is a collection of parts (or subsystems) that \ninteract to accomplish an overall goal. Systems have inputs, processes, outputs and \noutcomes, with ongoing feedback among these various parts. If one part of the system \nis removed, the nature of the system is changed   Complex systems, such as social \nsystems, are comprised of numerous subsystems as well. These subsystems are \narranged in hierarchies, and integrated to accomplish the overall goal of the overall \nsystem. Each subsystem has its own boundaries of sorts, and includes various inputs, \nprocesses, outputs and outcomes geared to accomplish an overall goal for the \nsubsystem \n \nComplexity refers not to the number of parts but the nature of their causal \ninteractions, specifically to non-linear causality where minor differences in initial \nvalues can lead to radically different outcomes, often referred to as the \u2018butterfly \neffect\u2019. In contrast to the classical linear view of the world in which it is assumed that \nsmall differences  converge to a point and that approximations can give a fairly \naccurate picture of what might happen, \u2018when a system is nonlinear and webbed with \nfeedback loops, repetition feeds the change back on itself, causing it to amplify and \ngrow\u2019 (Wheatley, 2006 p.120).  Therefore, although subsystems are seen as being in \nhierarchies, a systems approach challenges the widespread assumption that top-down \ncontrol is possible and desirable.  Senior management are not able to predict with \naccuracy the precise consequences of the various instructions they issue.  They \ntherefore need to ensure that there are good feedback loops so that they gather the \nnecessary evidence about how well their instructions are operating.      \n \nThis raises the question of how we define \u2018improvement\u2019 in performance.  In a top-\ndown control system, improvement is typically seen as greater compliance with \nprocedures, rules, etc.  In child protection, there is considerable scope for improving \npractitioners\u2019 compliance with principles of good practice. Child abuse inquiries \nrepeatedly identify significant deviations. The inquiry into the care of Victoria \nClimbie concluded that: \n \nVictoria died because those responsible for her care adopted poor practice \nstandards.  These were allowed to persist in the absence of effective \nsupervision and monitoring (Laming, 2003, para.6.94).   \n \nHowever, in a systems approach there is also recognition of the need to dig deeper to \nunderstand why practitioners break rules rather than just focus on ensuring \ncompliance through more control and monitoring.   Practitioners can break rules for \ngood reason.  The range of decision scenarios they confront is so varied that, at times, \nthe rules or accepted good practice do not apply. Also, when there are constraints of \ntime and resources in the system, workers have to make pragmatic decisions about \nwhat to prioritise.  Moreover, the behaviour within any one subsystem is influenced \nby the behaviour of the other subsystems with which it interacts. Therefore the work \nenvironment can make it difficult or undesirable to follow the official procedure.  \nWoods and Hollnagel (2006) point out that practitioners are often blamed for causing \nmistakes but their role in creating safety is at least as important.  In child protection \nwhere inter-agency working is so crucial, senior managers need to recognise that \nthose at the front line have more knowledge than they do about how the behaviour of \ntheir subsystem is interacting with that of other subsystems, e.g. how changes in \npolice procedures are affecting social work investigations.   \n \nThe systems approach, therefore, conceptualises learning within organisations not \nonly in terms of compliance with prescribed behaviour but also in terms of reflecting \non the rules and processes. Argyris and Schon (1978) formulate these two goals in \nterms of single- and double-loop learning. The theory will be familiar to many in \nchild protection in terms of individual learning through reflective practice.  However, \nthe principles apply also to organisational learning.   \n \nArgyris and Schon argue that people have mental maps about how to act in situations, \nguiding the way they plan, act, and review their actions.  These maps are more \ninfluential than the explicit theories that people adopt but many people are unaware of \nthe maps they are using.  They propose two theories of action: \u2018theories-in-use\u2019, \ngoverning actual behaviour and usually tacit, and \u2018espoused theory\u2019, how we explain \nour behaviour to others.  Developing congruence between the two will improve \neffectiveness and this requires us to become more aware of our theories-in-use \nthrough reflection and discussion.    \n \nLearning involves the detection and correction of error.   Responses to error can \ninvolve either single-loop or double-loop learning: \n \nWhen the error detected and corrected permits the organization to carry on its \npresent policies or achieve its present objectives, then that error-and-correction \nprocess is single-loop learning.  Single-loop learning is like a thermostat that \nlearns when it is too hot or too cold and turns the heat on or off.  The \nthermostat can perform this task because it can receive information (the \ntemperature of the room) and take corrective action.  Double-loop learning \noccurs when error is detected and corrected in ways that involve the \nmodification of an organization\u2019s underlying norms, policies and objectives \n(Argyris & Schon, 1978, p.2). \n \nApplying these ideas to child protection systems, the history of the past four decades \nshows major developments in formulating rules, guidance, and systems of \naccountability for front line workers.  There are excellent reasons for these \ndevelopments: they involve formulating best practice and seeking to ensure it is \nimplemented widely.  However, it can be argued that the way that they have been \nrealised has tended to encourage single-loop learning \u2013 of assuming that they are \nessentially the correct way of operating and seeking new ways of ensuring they are \nenacted.  Double-loop learning which would look more critically at the way \nimprovement is being sought has therefore been undervalued. Compliance with \nexisting procedures, rules and audit regimes is the key focus of appraisal rather than \nwhether those procedures, rules and so on are the best way of protecting children.  \n \nThis is contributing to professionals\u2019 dissatisfaction with their work. Recruitment and \nretention problems have become severe in many countries.  Research has shown that \nthe dominance of managerial control has been a contributing factor (Audit \nCommission, 2002; Gibelman & Schervish, 1996) and \u2018the erosion of opportunities \nfor professional discretion at the practice front\u2019  (Healy & Meagher, 2004 p.245; \nLaming, 2009)     \n \nIn England, Lord Laming\u2019s report on the progress of child protection services was \nhighly critical of the way practice has developed in recent years, painting a worrying \npicture: \nProfessional practice and judgement, as said by many who contributed \nevidence to this report, are being compromised by an over-complicated, \nlengthy and tick-box assessment and recording system. The direct interaction \nand engagement with children and their families, which is at the core of social \nwork, is said to be at risk as the needs of a work management tool overtake \nthose of evidence-based assessment, sound analysis and professional \njudgement about risk of harm (Laming, 2009 p.46). \n \nNew technology, e.g. software to structure case records, has been widely introduced \nin many countries to facilitate good practice but there is a growing body of research \ngiving detailed accounts of how it is, in practice, having negative effects and \ndisrupting the reasoning processes of professionals (Bell, Shaw, Sinclair, Sloper, & \nRafferty, 2007; Gillingham, 2009; Peckover & Hall, 2008). \n \nWhile many will agree that over-control is stifling good quality front-line work, it is \nnot easy to change direction and move to a more reflective organisation able to \nsupport more creative and adaptive performance at the front line.  Child protection \nsystems operate within wider social systems and are subject to a number of factors \nthat push them towards a defensive, controlling mode, key factors being the response \nto error, the dominance of blame, and the managerial approach which are now \nexplored. \nResponding to error \nA child\u2019s death provokes strong reactions and when that death looks as if it could and \nshould have been prevented by precisely those people employed to protect children, \nthe degree of public anger is intense.  The deaths of Victoria Climbi\u00e9 in England, \nSavanna in the Netherlands, Dean Shillingsworth in New South Wales, are examples \nof the way that individual cases have, in so many countries, been the major trigger for \nevaluating child protection services.   \n \nChild death reviews, or Serious Case Reviews in England, are a widespread \nprocedural response to deaths or serious injuries of children known to the child \nprotection system.  The aims are to understand what happened and to identify any \nlessons for improving practice.  This inevitably involves making judgments about \nwhether professionals could have and should have protected the child better.  Any \nsuch judgment rests on assumptions about causality, about how errors are produced.  \nThe standard views on causality have tended to push the system towards ascribing \nresponsibility mainly to individuals and therefore tended to produce solutions aimed \nat controlling the errant individuals. \nReason (2009) identifies four basic components in an error: the intention, the action, \nthe outcome, and the context.  Errors of intention encompass whether there was an \nintention to act (as opposed to an involuntary action), whether the actions went as \nplanned (absent-minded slips and lapses), and whether they achieved their intended \noutcome (was there a flaw in the plan of action) (Reason, 2009 p.29). Analyses of the \naction component raise questions such: was the action based on a good assessment of \nthe problem and plan of intervention; was it executed as planned; and was it \nadequately monitored to ensure it was going as planned (Reason, 2009 p.32)?  Much \nof the analysis in child abuse inquiries has focused on these aspects.  For example, \ninadequacies in the assessment of the child\u2019s safety are frequently linked to flaws in \ncommunication between different professionals in contact with the family (Munro, \n1999; Reder & Duncan, 2003).   \n \nAnalysing errors according to the third component - outcomes is problematic in child \nprotection.  An adverse outcome in child protection may not, on investigation, be \nconsidered to be due to any professional error.   However distressing the outcome, the \nblame may rest with the perpetrator alone.  A good decision process can lead to a poor \noutcome and a poor decision process can be followed by a good outcome.   \n \nThe fourth component, the context, is being increasingly recognised in other high risk \nservices as the most useful focus for solutions  (Department of Health, 2000; Institute \nof Medicine, 1999).  Reason contends that:  \n \nThe situation in which errors occur is at least as important as its psychological \nantecedents (if not more so) in triggering its occurrence and shaping its form.  \nWe cannot easily change human cognition, but we can create contexts in \nwhich errors are less likely and, when they do occur, increase their likelihood \nof detection and correction \u2026 situations can be more or less error-provoking \n(Reason, 2009 p.32). \n \nReason  (1997) distinguishes between \u2018active\u2019 errors and \u2018latent\u2019 conditions.  The \nformer are the actions or omissions of individuals at the front line that contributed to \nthe adverse outcome.  The latter are the underlying features of the organisational \ncontext, the policy priorities, resources, training and supervision, tools provided, etc.  \nThese create conditions in which error is more or less likely.   \n \nFor example, a child protection agency that adopts a policy priority of meeting \nperformance indicators sends out a message that other aspects of the work are less \nimportant.  If supervisors are short of time, there is a high likelihood that supervision \nwill focus on whether the worker has met the indicators, reducing time spent on \ncritical review of their reasoning.  This creates the scenario where errors of reasoning \nare less likely to be picked up and corrected. We know from research that individuals \nhave great difficulty in challenging their own reasoning (hence the need for \nsupervision) (Woods & Hollnagel, 2006) and so the error is likely to persist with \nhigher probability of an adverse outcome for the child.   \n \nSystemic investigations seek to find solutions that alter the latent conditions so that \nthe worker operates in a better designed context: \n \nThe aim is to make it harder for people to do something wrong and easier for \nthem to do it right (Institute of Medicine, 1999 p.2). \n \nWork has been done on adapting the systems approach to case reviews in child \nprotection (Fish, Munro, & Bairstow, 2008) but the dominant form of inquiries has \nbeen person-centred.  The first three categories of error analysis - intention, action, \nand outcome - have been the main focus on inquiry so that error tends to be explained \nby reference to factors within the individual. Underlying this approach is an \nassumption that the individual professional \u2018could have\u2019 acted differently; a high \ndegree of autonomy is assumed.  As Reason (2009 p.74) points out, this fits with \nWestern culture where we place great value in the belief that we are free agents, the \ncontrollers of our own destinies.  He cites in support research that found that \u2018when \npeople are given accident reports and asked to judge which causal factors were the \nmost avoidable, they almost invariably pick out the human actions\u2019. \n \nThis view of error results in solutions aimed at controlling the performance of those \nerrant individuals.  There are three main mechanisms for this, all apparent in child \nprotection systems.  First, there are psychological strategies, using punishments and \nrewards to shape behaviour and encourage people to work at a higher level. Secondly, \nthe autonomy of the individual is reduced where possible. This produces solutions \nthat primarily take of the form of prescribing in detail how the action should be \ncarried out.  In common with other countries, the past decades of inquiries in England \nhave produced an ever-expanding set of procedures and guidance which seek to \ndisseminate and standardise good practice (HM Government, 2006). Technology is \nalso increasingly being used to influence how professionals function.  For instance, \nmany countries and states now have prescribed software packages for social workers \nto use in recording which impose a structure on the reasoning of the workers (e.g. \nStructured Decision Making in Queensland, Australia and the Integrated Children\u2019s \nSystem in England).  Thirdly, organisations put more effort into monitoring the \nworkforce to ensure they are complying with all the rules and guidance.   \n \nIn many ways, all of these strategies make sense.  Ensuring that people adopt the right \npriorities in their work is very sensible.  Equally, protocols, guidance, and technology \ncan help to spread the lessons learned around the organisation and minimise the risk \nof people unknowingly repeating mistakes.  Some degree of monitoring practitioners \nis a standard part of any organisation.  \n \nHowever, problems arise when efforts to control workers lead to a level of \nstandardisation that goes beyond the established wisdom and so may not have \ndemonstrable links to improved outcomes for children.  Two other developments in \nchild protection have encouraged the drive to excessive standardisation and control: \nthe impact of a blame culture and the design of the performance management system.   \nThese have led to an over-valuation of the standardised, measurable aspects of \npractice and a consequent under-valuation of professional expertise and judgment. \nThis has a serious impact on the potential for learning from experience because it \ncreates a bias towards single- not double-loop learning.  \nThe impact of blame \nOne of the worst consequences of a person-centred approach to explaining error is \nthat it reinforces the drive towards a blame culture, a drive already fuelled by \nsociety\u2019s increasing concern about avoiding risk (Beck, 1992; M Power, 2007).   \n No longer do we see accidents as meaningless, uncontrollable events.  On the \ncontrary: accidents are evidence that a particular risk was not managed well \nenough. And behind the mismanagement, there was a person, or multiple \npeople. \u2026 we expect experts to make accidents comprehensible.  We want \nthem to explain which risk factors were not controlled, where, when, and by \nwhom.  Accidents are no longer accidents at all. They are failures of risk \nmanagement  (Dekker, 2007 p.x). \n \nThere are many psychological and organisational factors that contribute to creating a \nblame culture. \n \nFirstly, it offers a satisfying explanation. Those practitioners closest to the tragic \noutcome are readily identifiable and available to blame.   Blaming someone is \npsychologically satisfying; it distances oneself from any responsibility and feeds the \nbelief that errors are avoidable, not just acts of fate.  One bad apple has caused the \nproblem and everything will be fine if they are removed. The world, therefore, seems \nless dangerous and less beyond our control.   \n \nSecondly, hindsight bias distorts our judgment.  Once we know the outcome, we have \na tendency to over-estimate what could have been anticipated with foresight \n(Fischhoff, 1975).  The significance of new information, such as an observed change, \nlooks so clear to those who know how significant it turned out to be that they grossly \nover-estimate how easy it was to see it at the time when it was hidden in a mass of \nother information.   \n To the retrospective observer all the lines of causality home in on the bad \nevent; but those on the spot, possessed only of foresight, do not see this \nconvergence (Reason, 2009 p.75). \n \nThirdly, judgment is biased by the fundamental attribution error.  We tend to explain \nother people\u2019s behaviour differently from our own (Plous, 1993 p.174).  When \nanalysing our own actions, we are very aware of the context, of the factors that led us \nto frame the situation in a particular way that then led to the choice of action.  \nExplanations therefore tend to focus on those contextual factors. When explaining \nother people, however, we are most aware of the behaviour itself and so focus our \nexplanations on that rather than the context. Consequently, we tend to explain their \nactions in terms of their own characteristics.  \n \nWhen we see or hear of someone making an error, we attribute this to the \nperson\u2019s character or ability \u2013 to his or her personal qualities.  We say that he \nor she was careless, silly, incompetent, reckless or thoughtless.  But if you \nwere to ask the person in question why the error happened, they would almost \ncertainly tell you how the local circumstances forced them to act in that way.  \nThe truth of course lies somewhere in between (Reason & Hobbs, 2003 p.15).   \n \nFourthly, organisational factors encourage blaming.  To politicians and senior \nmanagement, person-centred explanations have the obvious attraction of distancing \nthemselves from the adverse outcome.  It is also a simple route to take. It is usually \neasy to identify the people close to the tragedy who made mistakes and target them \nfor improvement whereas a study of the wider organisational context would take \nconsiderably more effort.    Individual responsibility also fits readily into the legal \nsystem where it is easier to ascribe individual than corporate responsibility. \n \nThe cumulative effect of blame is to create what Reason (2009 p.73) terms the \n\u2018vulnerable system syndrome\u2019.  This is characterised by three pathological entities: \n\u2018blame, denial, and the single-minded and blinkered pursuit of the wrong kind of \nexcellence \u2013 the latter usually takes the form of seeking to achieve specific \nperformance targets\u2019.  A vulnerable system is particularly prone to focusing only on \nsingle-loop learning \u2013 on monitoring and enforcing compliance with existing \nprescriptions \u2013 while double-loop learning is severely hampered by individuals\u2019 \nreluctance to report problems for fear of being criticised.   \nThe impact of New Public Management \nThe potential for pursuing the \u2018wrong kind of excellence\u2019 is increased by the changes \nin how child protection services are managed.  Since the 1980s, public sector \nmanagement has been transformed by the introduction of techniques from the private \nsector aimed at making the services more efficient and effective, generally referred to \nas New Public Management (NPM).  Two major features of this change are increased \nmanagerial control of professional behaviour and a greater demand for transparency  \nso that services show they are spending public money wisely.  The resulting \nperformance management system has created a detailed framework of practice, \nspecifying targets and performance indicators to measure and shape practice plus, to \nmeet the need for transparency, a paper (or electronic) trail documenting professional \nactivity.   \n \nThese strategies can be seen as improving the feedback loops in the system, of giving \nsenior management a more detailed picture of how the organisation is operating.  \nThey therefore have the potential for improving organisational learning. However, the \ndifficulties lie in specifying what information gets fed back and what gets missed.   \nFor social work, this has been problematic and led to feedback being based on a very \nbiased set of data that omits some of the key quality aspects of a relationship-based \nservice.   \n \nAdapting to the NPM culture has required a transformation of practice, reducing the \nprivacy and autonomy with which social workers had operated (Munro, 2004).  The \naudit system requires some way of describing practice and of specifying \u2018good\u2019 \npractice.  As social workers had previously operated in a predominantly \nindividualistic and humanist manner with a limited explicit knowledge base, this has \nbeen a major project. It has been complicated by the limited evidence on what leads to \ngood outcomes for children.  We cannot confidently give a detailed specification of \nwhat good practice looks like in each case (Chaffin & Freidrich, 2004).  The \nperformance management system that has been devised has a model of good practice \nthat is based on expert opinion, not empirically validated.  It therefore should be \nproposed with some caution and a recognition of the need to test its adequacy. \nHowever, there is little explicit acknowledgement of the extent of uncertainty in the \nknowledge base and this poses a risk of overconfidence that discourages learning.   \n \nThe most visible aspects of the performance management system are targets, \nperformance indicators, and procedures detailing how tasks should be carried out.  \nCurrent systems tend to opt for the more easily measured and so have a focus on \nquantity in preference to quality, with an emphasis on fixed timetables and service \ninputs more than user outcomes (Tilbury, 2004).   \n \nThe system of targets which is widely used in the public sector has been subject to \nnumerous criticisms of leading to skewed priorities and failing to capture key \ndimensions of effectiveness (Bevan & Hood, 2006; M. Power, 2004).  In England, its \nadequacy was challenged in the case of Baby Peter where the relevant London \nBorough was praised and awarded three stars in an inspection conducted after his \ndeath.  The subsequent submissions to Lord Laming\u2019s progress report on safeguarding \nchildren contain many examples of how the management system is seen by \npractitioners as damaging their effectiveness (British Association of Social Workers, \n2008; UNISON, 2008).   \nThe cumulative impact \nPerson-centred explanations of error, a blame culture, and the current performance \nmanagement system interact in counterproductive ways to produces systems that are \ndefensive and discourage creativity and learning. \n \nPower\u2019s (2007 p.5) analysis of the influence of risk on management practices offers \nsome explanation of why the audit system has understated the degree of uncertainty.  \nDrawing on Luhmann\u2019s (1992) work, Power argues that introducing the language of \nrisk into discourses previously characterised by danger and uncertainty \u2018implies a \ndomain for decision making about the future and a corresponding allocation of \nresponsibility for that decision\u2019 (p.5). It suggests a social expectation that dangers can \nbe managed and that it is the responsibility of some agency or person to manage them.  \nIn child protection, the public have clearly stated just such an expectation.   It is \nprofessionals\u2019 job to manage the risk to children effectively.   \n \nUnfortunately, in practice \u2018managing risk effectively\u2019 is often judged by the outcome \nnot the process.  In the abstract, everyone acknowledges that, however good a child \nprotection service, it cannot eliminate harm to children. In practice, however, the first \nreaction of the public to the death of a child is generally to take it as prima facie \nevidence of ineffective risk management. Organisations have to prove, rather than \ndefend, their innocence in the debate about whether any identified errors were \navoidable, warranting censure, or unavoidable due to the uncertain conditions in \nwhich judgments and decisions are made.   \n \nIn this emotionally charged atmosphere, Rothstein et al.\u2019s (2006)  distinction between \nsocietal risk (the risk to children of maltreatment) and institutional risk (the risk to \nprofessionals and agencies of being criticised) helps to illuminate organisational \nresponses.  The cost of the latter has been increased by the intensity of public reaction \nto mistakes and the closer scrutiny of the inspection processes.  Ideally, the steps that \nprofessionals take to avoid criticism for poor practice should lead to a higher standard \nof practice and hence to reducing risk to children; managing the two forms of risk can \nbe complementary.  In relation to some of the more developed technologies in other \nhigh-risk areas of work, this is less problematic because there is a larger set of well-\nevidenced actions.  In child protection, with its limited knowledge base, \ndiscriminating between avoidable and unavoidable errors is problematic.  When \nexamining any case with a tragic outcome, it is often possible, with hindsight, to see \nthat information was available that we now know was evidence of heightened risk.  \u2018If \nonly the social worker had done X then the child would be alright\u2019 is all too easy a \nconclusion to reach.  When the analysis of error causation gives little attention to the \ncontext in which it occurred, it reinforces the tendency to consider the error was \navoidable and to blame the individual. \n \nFaced with an unrealistic expectation of safety, one option for organisations is to \nengage in \u2018blame prevention engineering\u2019 (Hood, Rothstein, & Baldwin, 2001), trying \nto transfer or dissipate blame by means other than reducing harm to children, i.e. \nseeking to reduce institutional risk without reducing societal risk.  Their research has \nfound that one strategy is \u2018protocolization\u2019, introducing more and more detailed \nformal procedures setting out the \u2018correct\u2019 way to deal with a case in steps that can be \nreadily performed and measured.  This move necessitates going beyond the evidence \nbase in specifying what should be done and limiting that specification to tasks that can \nbe readily observed and recorded \u2013 to provide the clear evidence trail that will deflect \nblame.  Thus, in child protection, formal procedures set out the timescale within \nwhich an initial assessment must be completed, when a case conference should be \nheld and so on but say little about the more challenging aspects of the work such as \nhow to assess a family where the father is violent, the mother withdrawn, and the \nchild terrified.   \n \nThis managerial strategy provides the defence of \u2018due diligence\u2019 if a tragic outcome \noccurs.  Senior management can demonstrate how their staff followed all the correct \nprocedures in working with the case and therefore cannot be blamed.  With the \nnotable exception of the recent death of Baby Peter, this defence appears to be \noperating in England where inquiries into child deaths often focus on checking \nwhether procedures were followed, rather than judging whether competent \nprofessional assessments and decisions were made.  Rose and Barnes, in their review \nof serious case reviews, note the priority given to procedures as the mechanism for \nimproving practice: \n \nWhat was marked was the emphasis in the recommendations on reviewing or \nstrengthening existing procedures or developing new procedures. This was \nsupported by the views of some of the respondents that the systems were \nadequate but the problem was one of staff compliance. There was less \nemphasis than might have been expected on issues of management, \nsupervision, staffing resources and staff knowledge, skills and experience. The \norganisational context, which in some agencies at the time was undergoing \nmajor change, resulting in disruption and discontinuity in staffing, also rarely \nfeatured in issues to be addressed (Rose & Barnes, 2008 p.88). \n \nFor practitioners, this \u2018protocolization\u2019 can be frustrating or reassuring, frustrating \nbecause it constrains their range of action,  reassuring because it limits their personal \nresponsibility for their actions.  The more punitive the work culture and risk-averse \nthe worker, the more practitioners will opt for the safer route of following procedures, \nhowever inappropriate they seem in a particular case.   \n \n\u2018Protocolization\u2019 carries dangers. Procedures, however detailed, are always \nincomplete specifications to some degree: \n \nThere is always a distance between a written rule and an actual task. This \ndistance needs to be bridged; the gap must be closed, and the only thing that \ncan close it is human interpretation and application (Dekker, 2006 p.134).  \n \nIn child protection work, procedures tend to refer to visible tasks but, to carry them \nout, the worker needs to exercise expertise.  For example, conducting an initial \nassessment requires interviewing skills, in order to elicit relevant information, and \nreasoning skills to analyse and reach conclusions on the basis of that incomplete and \noften ambiguous information.  An organisation that prioritises procedures runs the \nrisk of undervaluing the professional skills needed to apply the procedures \ncompetently.  In child protection work, evidence of this risk is seen in the reduced \ntime workers have to spend with children and families (Peckover & Hall, 2008) and \nthe erosion of supervision of casework, with priority being given to supervising \nmanagerial tasks (UNISON, 2008) . \n \nRasmussen\u2019s (1986) work on rule-based (RB) and knowledge-based (KB) actions \noffers a framework for considering how much child protection work can be rule-\nbased. Rules prescribe what the worker is to do in a given situation; the worker has to \nuse judgment to decide what kind of situation it is and then apply the appropriate rule.  \nKB behaviour is needed, however, in complex situations where it is not clear what \nneeds to be done and the worker has to draw on their expertise and make judgments \nabout the best course of action.   If it is known what needs to be done in specific \nsituations (e.g. if applying for a care order then complete the Public Law Outline) then \nit is desirable to have a rule.  If, however, the desirable action is not so specific, then \nprofessional judgment will be more appropriate.  What happens in a defensive culture \nis a tendency to convert as many actions as possible into rule-based not judgment-\nbased.  Hence, the finding in Rose and Barnes\u2019 review of serious case reviews of the \ntendency to create more rules despite these not addressing the identified weaknesses \nin practice. It is also evidenced in Lord Laming\u2019s (2009) progress report where \nrecommendation 19 is that social care agencies stop judging whether a referral from \nother professionals merits an initial assessment, and create a rule that all referrals \nreceive one.  Such a rule will have repercussions for both staff and service users.  For \nfamilies, many more will be subjected to an unpleasant inquiry that offers them \nnothing positive.  For staff, it will increase their caseloads and so create new problems \nof deciding what to omit in order to create time for the additional duty. \n \nDespite the lack of empirical backing for such an expansion of rules, its great \nattraction is that, when following a rule leads to an adverse outcome, the worker can \noffer the defence \u2018I was doing what I was told to do\u2019 and an agency can plead due \ndiligence.  In contrast, when following a judgment leads to an adverse outcome, the \nindividual is clearly identifiable and available to blame for making a poor judgment.  \nHowever, one necessary step in creating the space for professionals to be able to \nexercise expert judgment and be creative and flexible in responding to children\u2019s \nneeds is to work on clarifying which aspects of practice are appropriately dealt with \nby rules and which require judgment. \nConclusion \nThis article has argued for taking a systems approach to learning how better to \nmanage risks to children.  Conceptualising child protection services as complex, \nadaptive systems challenges the view that the \u2018top-down, command and control,\u2019 style \nof management is feasible.  Interactions between the subsystems are too complex to \npermit accurate prediction.  Instead organisations need good feedback loops so that \nsenior management can learn of problems and facilitate adaptations to avoid them.  \nMoving to such an open, reporting culture, however, is very difficult in the current \nsocial and political context.   The currently dominant way of managing risk and error \nin child protection has produced a set of solutions that has cumulatively encouraged \nincreasing standardisation and control, reducing the scope for professional judgment \nand flexibility in responding to children.   \n \nError investigations have focused on the individual elements of errors with \ninsufficient attention to the context in which they occurred.  This person-centred \napproach has a great deal of intuitive appeal.  However, it has two major weaknesses. \nFirst, it has been tried for decades and led to increasing efforts to control workers\u2019 \nperformance that have resulted in a system that is not only failing to protect children \nsufficiently but also creating work conditions that are counterproductive, leading to \ndistorted priorities and growing alienation of the workforce.  Secondly, the focus on \ncontrol and standardisation is hostile to learning about the weaknesses in practice and \nhence to finding ways of reducing the risks to children.   \n \nThe current design of management information systems produces feedback on a \nlimited range of data and omits areas of work, such as the quality of relationships,  \nthat are at the heart of good practice.  Moreover, because of its top-down design, it \ntends to look for compliance with prescribed behaviour and be critical of variations \nthus encouraging single- not double-loop learning.   \n \nThe defensive, controlling style of management is an understandable reaction to the \nlevel of blame from society when children die.  However, it is a response that \ninadvertently encourages people to place the protection of themselves and their \nagencies above the protection of children. Courage is needed to step out of this and \nthat courage is needed first and foremost in senior managers: \n \nChange has to start at the top because otherwise defensive senior managers are \nlikely to disown any transformation in reasoning patterns coming from below  \nIf professionals or middle managers begin to change the way they reason and \nact, such changes are likely to appear strange \u2013 if not actually dangerous \u2013 to \nthose at the top p(Argyris, 1991 p.108). \n \nIn child protection, we have limited knowledge about how best to protect children.  \nWe need to learn and, so, need organisations that encourage learning.  Accepting this \nwill be more constructive for children in the long run than over-estimating our \nknowledge and believing that we just need a bit more control of front line workers to \nmake the system work properly.   \n References \nArgyris, C.
