It draws on data\nfrom interviews, questionnaires and student marks to examine the link between use\nof the application and success measured through module marks. The relationship\nis not simple. Total abstainers and heavy users come out best, while medium level\nusers do less well, indicating the influence of two factors. The discussion section\nsuggests possible factors. The study also highlights the benefits of support and\nefficiency of communication that the application brings. Although there have been\nmany studies of synchronous communication tool use in the office and in social\nlife, this is one of the first to examine its informal use in an academic environment.\nKeywords: instant messaging; computer-mediated communication; social\ncomputing; informal communication; ethnographic research\nIntroduction\nThe background environment in which this study took place was a large open-plan\n500-seat Very Large Computing Centre (VLCC); often referred to as \u2018The Barn\u2019,\nwhich is open for the use of all students on one campus of a Scottish university. The\nfacility has not turned out to be the idyll that was envisaged and this has provided an\ninteresting field for sociological research (Buckner and Davenport 2002).\nThe case study reported here was prompted by observing students using MSN\nMessenger in computing tutorials. MSN Messenger is a synchronous communication\napplication offered free by the Microsoft Corporation. (The latest version is called\nWindows Live Messenger.) Students were observed using the application to keep in\ntouch with friends. Some students said that they used the application as part of their\nstudies, either in informal study groups or as a way of coordinating group projects or\nsimply to ask for help when stuck.\nThe institution has an ambivalent approach to the use of the application. It is not\nprovided as part of the official computing service. Some members of staff regularly\nuse it to communicate amongst themselves and with students. Some members of staff\nban it from tutorials, while others ignore its use.\nThis study investigates the benefits and disadvantages of the application to\nstudents. It compares existing literature, interviews, questionnaire data and assessment\nmarks. The next section is a review of relevant literature. Then come the findings from\nan interview phase, the results of a questionnaire and then a comparison with student\n*Email: m.rutter@napier.ac.uk\n34  M. Rutter\nmarks. Afterwards, there is a discussion section to compare the findings of each part\nof the investigation. The text of the questionnaire is provided in Appendix 1.\nThe application\nThere are a number of synchronous text communication products that are similar to\nMSN Messenger. For the rest of this communication, the term Messenger will be used\nto refer to any generic synchronous messaging application.\nAn instant messaging system typically comprises a server, which is maintained\ncentrally, and a client, which runs on a user\u2019s machine. There are a number of similar\ninstant messaging systems available (Microsoft, AIM, ICQ \u2026). \u2018System\u2019, in this\ncontext, refers to the server that coordinates the messages and communications\nbetween clients. These are similar, but not interoperable.\nMessaging clients typically take the form of a management window, in which\nusers may see the names of those with whom they normally communicate (or\nbuddies), and a conversation window, in which users may see ongoing conversations\n(Figure 1). The management window usually shows who is online at that moment.\nFigure 1. The two Messenger application windows.\nInteraction with people\nIn a questionnaire study of the campus ecology, de Bakker, Sloep, and Jochems (2007)\nreport that students use Messenger for (in order of frequency): discussing tasks with\nFigure 1. The two Messenger application windows.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   35\ncolleagues, sharing files, cooperating on tasks, discussing course material, gathering\ncontent for coursework, reflecting on colleagues\u2019 work and teacher guidance.\nDespite Messenger\u2019s usefulness, some feel guilt about the time they put into\nMessenger communication. Green et al. (2005) report that online communication\nmakes people feel happier during the time while they are engaged and that this is\nmildly addictive. For some reason, the boost in mood seems to be more pronounced\nin women. In their survey conducted on US college students, over half said that they\nused the Internet too much. In a separate piece of research at Rutgers University\n(Kubey, Lavin, and Barrows 2001), 9% reported that they may have become depen-\ndent on the Internet, i.e. that they wished that they used it less, but found it difficult to\ncontrol. Herbsleb et al. (2002) confirm that there are workplaces where the culture\nregards \u2018informal chatting\u2019 as a waste of time or socially undesirable. It would be\ndifficult for the application to gain ground in such an environment.\nThere is also evidence (Kubey, Lavin, and Barrows 2001) that Internet usage in\ngeneral may have an adverse effect on student success. In particular, 14% reported\nthat their academic performance had been hurt by Internet usage, 40% reported that it\nkept them up late, 42% reported that they felt tired the next day, while 20% reported\nthat they had missed classes as a result of Internet use the previous evening.\nMany office users leave the Messenger application open while they are doing\nregular desk work. It seems to lend itself to continuous partial attention (Stone 2007),\nwith users glancing at the application while doing other tasks. In an ethnographic\nstudy of Messenger use in an office environment, Nardi, Whittaker, and Bradner\n(2000) observed that it is relatively easy to read or even originate messages while on\nthe phone or in a face-to-face conversation at one\u2019s desk. Avrahami and Hudson\n(2006), using special software to measure the habits of volunteers, determined that\nMessenger conversations with colleagues tended to be more intense and last a shorter\ntime than those with friends and family. In the latter case, it is quite common to have\nintermittent conversations, stretched out over a very long time (Nardi, Whittaker and\nBradner 2000).\nOne of the positive effects of Messenger is to facilitate relationships, hopefully\ngenerating social capital (cf. Hall and Wid\u00e9n-Wulff 2008) in the family and work-\nplace. In a South Korean questionnaire survey, the favourite media for students were\nfound to be Messenger, mobile phone and short message service (SMS) messaging\n(Kim et al. 2007). Messenger was used in expanding relationships with weak ties i.e.\nthey will invite into their circle of buddies people who are members of their social\ncircle but not necessarily close friends. It was seen as a family medium that supports\nsome work relationships also.\nThe initial background review of the general use of the application prompted ques-\ntions about its use and usefulness in the academic environment, which the following\nstudy attempted to answer.\nMethodology\nAn exploratory ethnographic approach was adopted. The investigation followed a\nthree-stage methodology. The first step was a grounded assessment of emergent issues\n(Dick 2002) through unstructured interviews in which respondents were encouraged\nto raise personal issues, concerns and interests around the use of the technology.\nRepresentatives of the various facets of university life were selected: students, staff\nand computer personnel. The student interviewees were a convenience sample. The\n36  M. Rutter\nauthor simply walked through the computing facility and looked for students who had\nMessenger open. Users were invited for a free coffee and an interview. Most agreed,\nbut polite refusals were accepted in good part. It was an opportunity to collect data\nfrom a cross-section of students from a variety of different disciplines. Interviewees\nwere encouraged to talk freely, but the interviewer would probe whenever a statement\naroused his curiosity. A review of the literature had highlighted the topics of mutual\nhelping, times when the application was activated and deactivated, social use and\nsupport. Seed questions on these topics were introduced in order to prompt discussion\nof these categories. Nielsen and Landauer (1993) showed that the emergence of new\ntopics from the collection of qualitative data follows a Poisson curve; after seven\ninterviews it was felt that points were being duplicated and new themes were no\nlonger emerging. The qualitative analysis of both literature and interview data led to\nan iterative process of grouping themes. These themes provided the basis of a\nstructured data collection tool in the form of a questionnaire.\nThe second stage was to apply the structured data collection tool in a classroom\nsetting. The questionnaire (Appendix 1) was administered in the autumn of 2006 to\nthe students on the two computing modules on which the author was timetabled.\nAlmost all students present in the two lectures filled in the form, resulting in 53\ncompleted returns. The topics covered in the questionnaire included frequency of use,\ncontexts of use, use for study, social use and the location of the student\u2019s home. Most\nanswers were given on a five-point Likert scale.\nHaving processed questionnaire data, reported use of Messenger was compared\nwith recorded marks in order to help fill in the emergent picture. The literature\nindicated that Messenger use might reduce success as measured by module marks.\nCorrelation gave suspicious results, later explained by the parabolic nature of the rela-\ntionship, so the data were graphed. Only statistical data were extracted, from which it\nwas impossible to identify individuals.\nInitial interviews\nStudents\nIn all, seven student interviews were conducted and transcribed. Only the findings\nrelevant to this communication are reported.\nA natural question was whether the student had ever used the application to ask for\nhelp with their work or to help others: \nZ: Yes, yes.\u2026 Not so often. Once or twice a week, I think.\nR: Mostly I ask my friends in [my home country]. Some of them know quite a bit \u2019cos\nnormally I\u2019m stuck on computer stuff like 3D modelling and stuff like that, and\nit\u2019s really convenient for me to use MSN.\nM: Yep. All the time. Constantly. I would even text somebody and say \u2018go on line,\nI\u2019m stuck\u2019. So they go on MSN and they can help me with it \u2026 The [computing]\ncentre is big and it just saves me at lot of time. And you don\u2019t interfere with their\nstudying the same as if you went over there. If it was just something easy I would\nask over MSN, but if it was something big I\u2019d go over there of course \u2026\nSome felt that the application did not lend itself to discussions about work, but was a\ngood way to make them happen: Student G, in a group project, would not discuss\nwork over the application, but would use it to set up meetings. A would not use\nMessenger to discuss work: \nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   37\nA: No, I don\u2019t think. Just to contact them and speak. It\u2019s easier to speak when you can\nhave people in front of you and to explain the problem they\u2019ve got and all that\nthing. I think it\u2019s a better way than via writing and all things.\nStudents voiced a fear of addiction and lost time. G confessed to being easily\ndistracted into surfing. D had seen friends sucked into wasting time on the computers\nand was wary of letting it happen to himself: \nD: There is a case for people being on MSN and being on it too long. You know, if\nyou allow it to interfere with your coursework here and your work studies here, it\ncan become \u2026 like you need to know when to stop and \u2026 like if you saw people\ncoming up in your Messenger and you\u2019re online. If you just made an attempt to\nalways start off a conversation, you could be on it for always, without even know-\ning that time passed. Some people let it get a grip of them in a way, like you know\nso \u2026 I don\u2019t know.\nBoth M and R regularly used Messenger to locate friends and invite them for a break\nor arrange a social activity for later. They were used to friends reciprocating in a\nsimilar way: \nR: I use it mostly to chat with my friends and keep in contact. It\u2019s one of the alterna-\ntives to using the phone. Because while I was in the [computing] centre some of\nmy friends in Edinburgh were on MSN. So it\u2019s just like \u2018OK were going to meet\nup in a few hours\u2019 instead of having to call each other. It like saves you money as\nwell. It\u2019s just easy. It, like, pops up on the screen and says \u2018want to meet up at 2 pm\noutside of school\u2019 and I say \u2018yes\u2019. It\u2019s really easy and convenient.\nMost of those interviewed said they were studying away from home and used the\napplication to maintain relationships \u2018back home\u2019: \nL: I think it helps people keep in contact with their family back at home when they\u2019re\naway at uni. So it\u2019s good for me so I can still chat to my friends occasionally when\nI\u2019m here.\nR: I started studying back home in [my home country] and it was really convenient\nfor me because I moved away from my home city so that\u2019s when I first set up\nan MSN account because it was convenient talking to my friends that lived far\nfrom me.\nIn its curious mix of academic and social elements, the VLCC had developed an atmo-\nsphere comparable to that of a library. It was difficult to speak to M to invite her for\nan interview, because she listens to music on headphones while she works and cannot\nhear external sounds: \nM: I can\u2019t work at home \u2013 there\u2019s too many distractions, so I come in here to work\nand I have it on all of the time \u2026 I\u2019ve got the Internet and I have everything at\nhome. I just feel better working at uni.\nA: We are thirty [compatriots], so we share our ideas, or the way we are working for\none subject or another. We try to work together with our flatmates. Yeah we share\nour work \u2026 So we are working in computers or we stay here to work or in the\nlibrary place.\nStudent Z spoke of the centre\u2019s sheer size; if he wanted to find somebody, he would\ndo it over Messenger rather than stand up and look for them.\n38  M. Rutter\nTeaching staff\nThe computing facility is arranged into long tables (\u2018clusters\u2019) of 12 computers, six\neither side. Tutorials will typically run over two or four of these tables, running for\none or two hours at a time. Teaching staff adopt a variety of policies towards owner-\nship of these: some reserve them exclusively for students on their course; some allow\ninterlopers to come and do their own work if there are spare computers. The lecturers\nconsulted had a variety of approaches. One bans the use of Messenger and email from\nher tutorial groups completely. Others were more flexible: \nLB: I walk round the tutorial group. If they\u2019re doing tutorial work, I stop and ask them\nhow they\u2019re getting on. If they\u2019re looking at the Internet or emailing people, then\nit\u2019s not my tutorial that they\u2019re doing. Therefore, unless I have cause to worry\nabout them, I won\u2019t have any further contact with them in that tutorial.\nHow much of their tutorial time \u2013 at a guess \u2013 does it use?\nLG: Some of them not at all, others allow it to dominate their tutorial session. I tend to\ninterfere then, to ensure it doesn\u2019t. I ask them how they\u2019re getting on with the work\nwhich was scheduled for that lab. At that point they usually find it difficult to\nanswer and it causes them to start doing something.\nOne lecturer estimated that when Messenger is permitted in tutorials, it takes up about\n5% of the student\u2019s time.\nSome lecturers had set tutorial exercises in which students were asked to set up\ngroup conversations over Messenger and discuss a set topic. Aside from these exer-\ncises none of the lecturers consulted had ever seen Messenger being spontaneously\nused for work. This observation may not be significant, for in order to actually read a\nMessenger window one would need to be intrusively close to the screen. Many\nstudents have the routine habit of hiding (minimising) their Messenger window on the\napproach of a lecturer.\nThere were also anecdotes about Messenger being used for cheating in supervised\ntests conducted in the VLCC.\nComputing facility staff\nThe manager of the computing facility said that Messenger was not a standard part of\nthe computing provision she offered. Rather, students downloaded and installed the\nsoftware by themselves. She would prefer that students would not install their own\nsoftware, but locking down installation rights would make it more difficult for some\nlegitimate applications to operate.\nThe questionnaire\nA 19-item questionnaire (Appendix 1) was administered to the students on two\ncomputing modules, one software engineering, the other human\u2013computer interaction\n(HCI). Below is an analysis of those results relevant to frequency of use, social\nsupport, academic support and disturbance of concentration. Percentages are rounded\nfor readability.\nStudents were asked for what proportion of the time they kept the application acti-\nvated while they were sitting at a computer, irrespective of use. Some students (7.5%)\nreported that they never used the Messenger application at all. Almost three quarters\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   39\n(74%) said that Messenger was activated for at least half the time when they were\nusing a computer. About half of the respondents (49%) replied that they had it on all\nthe time. A note on confidence intervals here: to a 95% confidence level, and with this\nsmall sample size, this would mean 49% \u00b113% for a larger population. This small data\nset therefore only has value in illustrating this modest case-study.\nOne of the more interesting discoveries of the interviews was the role that Messenger\nplays in providing social support. A third (34%) of all the respondents reported that\nthey regularly used the application to keep in touch with their family; this number rose\nto over half (56%) for the 62% living away from home. Most (70%) said that they used\nthe application regularly to keep in touch with friends who were not enrolled at the\nuniversity and this number did not change significantly for those living away from\nhome. Over a quarter (29%) wished that more people they knew used Messenger.\nStudents were asked how much they used Messenger to give and receive help in\nuniversity work: three quarters (75%) have sometimes used the application to ask\nbuddies for help and a quarter (25%) do this regularly. On the giving side, 77% said\nthat they have been asked for help via this medium.\nAlmost all (85%) have disabled Messenger when they needed to concentrate on\nwork. Most (69%) do this regularly. Fifteen percent said that they worry that they are\nputting too much time into the application. All but one of the latter fell into the\ncategories of those who use Messenger for most or all of their computer activity. The\nmodule marks of this small group of students averaged five percentage points below\nthose of the rest of the sample, so their answers may have been insightful.\nThe outcomes of the questionnaire indicated that most students used the applica-\ntion for most of the time they were at a computer. It is used by most to keep in touch\nwith friends. Those living away from home use it to keep in touch with their families.\nThe application is used to a significant level for peer support. Nevertheless, most\nstudents recognise that Messenger affects their ability to concentrate and will disable\nit if necessary.\nModule marks\nOne of the aims was to determine the effect of Messenger usage on the educational\nprocess. The results of Question 1 in the questionnaire (\u2018I use Messenger: never, some\ndays, about half the time, most days, always\u2019) were compared with the percentage\nmarks that students gained in some of the assessments. Taking each category from\nquestion one, e.g. \u2018I never use Messenger\u2019, the average mark was taken of all students\ngiving that reply, over two study modules. In each case, coursework and exam marks\nwere entered separately, yielding a data set of 90 values. The means and standard\ndeviations of the samples are given in Table 1.\nTable 1. Summary statistics of the coursework and exam marks used in the analysis.\nNumber in \nmodule\nNumber in \nsample\nSample \nmean\nSample standard \ndeviation\nSoftware module Coursework 28 22 73.0 9.5\nExam 28 19 66.8 14.2\nHCI module Coursework 32 25 53.6 12.7\nExam 30 24 58.2 13.8\nGroup project module Reflection 54 21 47.3 14.1\n40  M. Rutter\nThe results of the comparison are shown in Figure 2. These show that the students\nwho did not use Messenger at all achieved the highest marks. Students in this category\ncome out a full seven percentage points ahead of the next category. The next highest\ncategory was that of the students who said that they used Messenger on \u2018some days\u2019.\nThe surprising result of this histogram was that students who said that they used the\napplication \u2018always\u2019 came out ahead of those who said that they used it \u2018most days\u2019\nor even \u2018half the time\u2019. The histogram appears to be parabolic in nature. This suggests\nthe operation of two different effects, one favouring complete abstainers and the other\nfavouring heavy users.\nFigure 2. The averaged marks of two modules compared with student use of Messenger.Deliberately looking for a data set in which heavy users of Messenger might do\nwell, a set was taken from part of the group project module, in which students were\nasked to reflect on the experience of being in a group. Again, the student marks were\ncompared with the questionnaire question about general Messenger usage (Figure 3).\nThe sample was restricted to students who had also attended modules to which the\nquestionnaire was administered, so there are only 21 samples in the set. Again, the\ncategory scoring highest marks was that of total abstinence. However, it appears that\nhabitual users are also at an advantage, coming out 13 percentage points higher than\nthe light user category.\nFigure 3. The marks for a piece of reflective writing compared with student use of Messenger.Finally, a review was done of those who left the application permanently on and\nwho achieved higher than average marks in the HCI and software engineering\nmodules. This was an attempt to use the existing data to determine why their perfor-\nmance was so good. A slightly higher proportion was regularly asked for help (30%\nas opposed to 25% for the rest of the sampled population). This may have been simply\nbecause they were better than average performers. They were slightly more inclined\nto disable the application when they needed to concentrate (77% as opposed to 69%\n73.0\n65.6\n60.3\n54.4\n63.3\n0.0\n10.0\n20.0\n30.0\n40.0\n50.0\n60.0\n70.0\n80.0\nM\nar\nks\n o\nu\nt \no\nf \n10\n0\nNever Some Days About Half the\nTime\nMost days Always\nMessenger Usage\nFigure 2.

A significant number were living away from home (54% as\nopposed to 38% of the entire sample \u2013 16 percentage points).\nDiscussion\nIt is simplistic to use module marks as a measure of the educational process. Marks\nare a short-term foreground measure of how well the students are learning useful\ntechnical skills. Meanwhile, the process of education, learning to read, write, think\nand communicate, is a long-term activity which continues in the background. It is\nhoped that the two are related, but that relationship is not a direct one. Marks may be\nviewed as correlated with the educational process and also with student engagement.\nHowever, under the pressure to produce a large quantity of credit-bearing output,\nstudents may be losing the resources which would have contributed to deeper learning\n(cf. Entwistle 2000).\nMany regard Messenger as a distraction. Whereas the literature reports guilt about\nthe time put into Internet activity, only a small percentage reported these feelings in\nthe questionnaire. Nevertheless, in other studies Internet use has been reported to be\naddictive, and the high take-up rate reported here may be evidence of that. In the\ninterviews, students reported a wariness of being sucked into wasting time. In the\nquestionnaire, most reported disabling Messenger when they needed to concentrate,\ndemonstrating an awareness of the difficulties of continuous partial attention.\nThe literature confirms that there are those both inside and outside academia that\nregard Messenger as a waste of the users\u2019 own resources and that internet usage may\nhave an adverse effect on student success. Staff reported a low opinion of Messenger\u2019s\nusefulness. It is sometimes banned from tutorials. In the sample reported here, the\n66.7\n36.7\n26.7\n48.6 51.1\n0.0\n10.0\n20.0\n30.0\n40.0\n50.0\n60.0\n70.0\nM\nar\nks\n o\nu\nt \no\nf \n10\n0\nNever Some Days About Half the\nTime\nMost days Always\nMessenger Usage\nFigure 3. The marks for a piece of reflective writing compared with student use of Messenger.\n42  M. Rutter\nhighest scoring students were total abstainers. In tutorial work, students were observed\nto keep the application deliberately below the horizon of notice, which may explain\nwhy some staff say that they have never seen it used for academic work. The academic\nenvironment is still one in which individual achievement is valued highly, so it is\nreasonable to expect a suspicion of achievement which is not individual. The results\nreported here do indicate a tension between an independent work ethic and the support\nof the hive.\nThere is evidence that Messenger use contributes to academic success. The litera-\nture reports that students spontaneously use the application for a variety of academic\ntasks. Nevertheless, in the interviews here, it was commented that Messenger is better\nfor organising discussions than for having them. In this case study there is strong\nevidence that heavy users do well. The parabolic nature of the histograms may\nindicate that it is of different usefulness to different study styles. An alternative expla-\nnation might be that heavy users have mastered the application and integrated it into\ntheir university lives. It was noted that those heavy users who did well tended to\ninclude more students living away from home. An explanation of the latter finding\nmay be that we had a number of excellent advanced-entry French students who\nbrought with them a culture of using the application.\nWhen it was observed that heavy users performed better than some lighter users,\nit was conjectured that sociable and socially aware students might be drawn to use\nMessenger as a way to continue their natural networking activities. The second piece\nof coursework selected for investigation was intended to place socially aware\nstudents at an advantage, and thus emphasise this trend. The trend was indeed empha-\nsised, which lends evidence to the hypothesis. Indeed, evidence from the Learning\nExperience (LXP) project funded by the UK Joint Information Systems Committee\n(Conole et al. 2006) indicates that students in the UK are now spontaneously using a\nvariety of communication tools to set up communities of practice for mutual support,\nincluding advice, resource sharing and improvement suggestions on work.\nIn the university world many students are adapting to a new learning ecology\nwhile simultaneously learning how to live away from home. Support is now recogn-\nised as having a far greater impact on retention and academic success than was\nperceived in the past (Sidle and McReynolds 1999). The literature reports that one of\nthe most popular uses of Messenger is to keep in touch with friends and family. This\nis confirmed by the questionnaire, in which students reported that Messenger was used\nregularly to keep in touch with family and friends not attending the university. There\nwas only a slight difference in the extent of this use for students living away from\nhome.\nConclusions\nThe journey represented by this study started out with the idea that the use of MSN\nMessenger and similar social networking applications may be a drain on resources,\nwhich detracted from student education. The question of whether it is a drain or an\naugmentation of student resources does not appear to have a clear answer. It was\nenvisaged that Messenger had certain advantages, but that these would be outweighed\nby the time spent playing with the application. The investigation has revealed\nevidence that overall, for the population of students investigated, this may indeed be\ntrue. Those who abstain from Messenger do seem to do better than the overwhelming\nmajority who do use it. However, an observation of the data has shown that of those\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   43\nstudents who do use the application, heavy users seem to do best. Having established\na link, it should be the subject of a further investigation.\nIn retrospect, a larger sample size would have enhanced the credibility of the\nquestionnaire phase. The two graphs show reassuringly similar curves for different\nsets of marks. Nevertheless, a larger sample would have reduced the suspicion that the\nphenomenon displayed was an artefact of this particular set of students. The exercise\nwas an opportunity to validate the approach, which could be refined in future work.\nA further piece of work might be to investigate those heavy users who do particu-\nlarly well, and examine their characteristics. These students will certainly have\nacquired knowledge about the effective use of the application, which they might be\npersuaded to pass on. The dissemination of good practice in earlier study skills\nmodules might lead to a general enhancement of performance among the wider\nstudent population. A further potential investigation might be a comparison of\nMessenger use with learning styles. Topics might include an investigation of what\nkinds of learners are most and least attracted to the application, and what kinds of\nlearners find it most useful. Indeed, it may turn out that highly socialised, networked\nstudents make better learners, whether they use the application or not.\nAn unexpected revelation encountered during the study is the amount of support\nthat students gain from the application. It is tempting to ignore students\u2019 social needs\nwhen considering academic advantages. Nevertheless, support has been shown to\nimpact retention and academic success, even though that impact is difficult to\nmeasure. The concept of support may be extended to the academic domain too. Many\nbelieve that formal or informal peer tutoring is at least as powerful as guidance by\nacademic staff. A study of networking effects within cohorts may yield results that\ncould then be reverse-engineered to enhance retention. Peer support is certainly more\navailable and far less resource intensive in an academic environment.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank all those who supported this study in various ways.
