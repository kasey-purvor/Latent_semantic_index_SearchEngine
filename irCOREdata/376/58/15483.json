Introduction: Island Brands and Island Branding \n \nThe unbranded state has a difficult time attracting economic and political \nattention. Image and reputation are becoming essential parts of the state\u2019s \nstrategic equity.  \n(Van Ham, 2004: 17; emphasis in original)  \n \nWhile Van Ham might be referring to a particular geographical unit in this instance, he is \nreflecting the wider phenomenon of \u2018place branding\u2019. There has been a growing interest \nof late in both the public sector and academic arena with place branding. Branding of \nplaces is seen by country and city governments as a marketing tool to attract investors \nand tourists (Allen, 2007). In this era of globalisation and technological advancement, \ncountries and increasingly, cities, seek to differentiate themselves as they compete \namongst each other to be financial centres and choice locations for foot-loose industries. \nMoreover, as the World Tourism Organisation acknowledges, tourists, with increased \nmobility, are treating tourism destinations as fashion accessories (Morgan et al., 2002) \nthat reflect their self-identities. In a semiotic society, signs and images give meaning to \nconsumption (Baudrillard, 1968), and brands are able to create and transmit them \nefficiently (Freire, 2005). A brand thus goes beyond its original function \u201cto distinguish \nand identify\u201d; it assumes \u201cfetishistic qualities of image and power\u201d as advertisers craft \n\u201cassociations, attributes and characterizations designed to induce a psychological \nresponse\u2026\u201d (Donald and Gammack, 2007: 46). It is no wonder that \u2018destination \nbranding\u2019 (Morgan et al., 2002) has landed itself such a high priority in the eyes of \ntourism planners.  \n \n It is not the intention of this paper to provide a comprehensive literature review of \nacademic research on place branding. Moreover, Dinnie (2004) and Gould and Skinner \n(2007) have been excellent in capturing the changing approaches and emerging trends in \nthe literature. Nevertheless, it is not difficult to realise that the place branding lexicon \ntypically evolves around the likes of \u2018nation branding\u2019 (Anholt, 2004; Gudjonsson, 2005, \n\u2018city branding\u2019 (Kavaratzis and Ashworth, 2006; Donald and Gammack, 2007), \u2018place \nbranding\u2019 (Papadopoulos, 2004; Anholt, 2005), \u2018geo-branding\u2019 (Freire, 2005) and \n\u2018destination branding\u2019 (Morgan et al., 2002). There seems to be a dearth of research that \n 3 \nfocuses on \u2018island branding\u2019 per se. Although one may argue that \u2018islands\u2019 can be \nsubsumed under \u2018place\u2019 or \u2018destination\u2019, they are in fact geographical features that \npossess unique characteristics and experience distinctive circumstances (Baldacchino, \n2005). Furthermore, I argue that the word \u2018island\u2019 is a brand in its own rights. Mention \n\u201cisland tourism\u201d, and images of sun, sand and sea will emerge in one\u2019s mind. Hence, \nislands might be facing the threat of being homogenised in an age of globalisation as \ntourism planners attempt to transform islands into identically manicured beach-resort \nlandscapes for tourists (Zhang, 2007). The challenge then, is for planners to recognise the \nunique character of each island in order to localise development projects in terms of its \ngeographical particularity and landscape identity. As such, islands deserve to be analysed \non their own terms (Baldacchino, 2007) and this is where island branding comes into \nplay. This paper discusses the nuances of island brands and island branding in the context \nof the former military island of Kinmen, Taiwan. Due to the complexity of island \nbranding and its relationship to different audiences, I focus specifically on the tourism \naspect of Kinmen Island.      \n \n2.  Setting the Stage: Kinmen in Context \n \n2.1  Kinmen as a battlefield  \n \nBefore explicating the objectives of this paper, let me foreground the historical events \nthat form the basis of Kinmen\u2019s battlefield identity. Covering an area of 150km2 and a \npopulation of 72,000, Kinmen2 is located 350km southwest of Taipei, Taiwan, but a mere \n10km from the city of Xiamen in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) (Figure 1). The \nisland became a military stronghold of the Kuomintang\u2019s (KMT) Nationalist Army after \nits forces retreated from the mainland during the Civil War with the Chinese Communist \nParty\u2019s (CCP) People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) in 1949. Kinmen, together with Matsu \nand a number of other off-shore islands were intended to be \u201cstepping stones\u201d  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2\n Kinmen is an archipelago consisting of 12 islands. This paper focuses on the 2 main islands, namely \u2018Big \nKinmen\u2019 and \u2018Little Kinmen\u2019. Unless otherwise stated, \u2018Kinmen\u2019 refers to both islands (see Figure 1).  \n 4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nfor Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s forces to reclaim the mainland. Initial attempts by the communists \nto capture Kinmen were thwarted by KMT\u2019s victory in the Guningtou Battle on Kinmen \nin late 1949. The onset of the global Cold War and the American doctrine of containment \nfurther acted as a deterrence to the communist\u2019s plans for invasion. However, the First \nand Second Straits Crisis in 1954 and 1958 respectively, saw the PRC engaging Kinmen \nin fierce artillery battles. Intervention by the United States (US) denied the prospect of a \ntake-over. Therefore, the status of Kinmen had and still has symbolic meaning for \nTaiwan in the wider geopolitical context. The involvement of the US in the prevention of \na CCP take-over testifies to the importance of the island\u2019s strategic position as a bastion \nagainst communist threat. Indeed as Chen Chao-Jin, Director General of the County \nGovernment Research and Development Department, stressed, \u201cWithout Kinmen, there \nwill be no Taiwan.\u201d (Personal interview, 23 May 2006).   \n \nAs a result of these events, Kinmen became a highly militarised area. Fortresses, \npillboxes and underground tunnels can be found on the island and as much as one-third of \nTaipei\nKinmen\nXiamen\n \n \nFigure 1 Map of Kinmen, Taiwan \n \n(Source: http:\/\/tour.kinmen.gov.tw) \n \n 5 \nTaiwan\u2019s total army was stationed on the island, outnumbering the local population of \n60,000 (Szonyi, 2005).3 Apart from the conscripted soldiers, a militia system had also \nbeen set up whereby civilian villages were transformed into \u2018combat villages\u2019 (Chi, \n2004). In 1956, the KMT government introduced the \u201cExperimental Scheme of War Area \nAdministration on Kinmen and Matsu\u201d, which subjected the islands to absolute military \ncontrol (Jinmen xianzhi, 1992, cited in Chi, 2004). In Kinmen, the troops were the main \nconsumer base that sustained the local economy until 1992 when tourism became \nincreasingly important.  \n \n \n2.2  From battlefield to tourist destination  \n \nWith the abolition of martial law in 1992, the gradual de-militarisation and opening up of \nKinmen took shape. This resulted in its evolution from a military outpost to a tourist \ndestination. With the partial withdrawal of troops from the island,4 the economic void left \nbehind by the garrison had to be filled up. Tourism emerged as the lifeline of Kinmen. \nThe military landscape, defence installations and infrastructure were readily utilised for \ntourism development. In addition, according to Yang and Hsing (2001: 78), Kinmen\u2019s \n\u201cculture industries5\u2026 have [also] become the potential cultural consumption resources \nthat\u2026 [help] long-term \u2026 reconstruction and regeneration since the abolition of martial \nlaw\u201d. \n \n Although the majority of tourists are Taiwanese, the establishment of the \u201cmini \nthree links\u201d6 in January 2001 meant that PRC tourists are also allowed to visit Kinmen.7 \nAccording to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, \u201cthe transit of people and \ncommodities from Kinmen to China has grown substantially over the past two years since \nthe \u2018mini three links\u2019 were established\u201d (The Taiwan Economic News, 7 February 2003). \nThe tourism planners recognise the great potential of the Chinese market and have even \n                                                 \n3\n Although the garrison size was never disclosed, it is estimated at 100,000.   \n4\n It is estimated that the garrison size will be reduced to 5000. \n5\n Apart from war heritage, Kinmen also boasts well preserved traditional houses of South-Min architecture. \nNature tourism has also been promoted recently, especially the 300 bird species found on the island.   \n6\n The three links refer to economic and social links for direct trade, postal and shipping between Kinmen \nand Matsu of Taiwan, and Xiamen and Fuzhou of PRC (The Economist, 6 January 2001).  \n7\n Previously, Kinmen was primarily visited by domestic Taiwanese tourists.   \n 6 \nmade amendments to sensitive captions in the various war museums so as not to offend \nthe PRC tourists. Such efforts to tone down the otherwise hostile attitude towards the \ncommunist regime in China will be discussed in a later section. \n \n In short, tourism is seen as an important activity since the de-militarisation of \nKinmen. Concerted efforts have been and are still being taken to increase tourism arrivals \nand receipts. Therefore it is timely to examine the role of place branding in promoting the \nisland as a battlefield tourism destination.   \n \n \n3.  Objectives, Argument and Method \n \nThe objectives of this study are three-fold. Firstly, I seek to discuss the current efforts by \ntourism planners in establishing a battlefield tourism brand for Kinmen. This is done by \nanalysing how they go about representing the island\u2019s military past both in tourism \npromotion and in (re)-creating the battlefield tourism sites. Secondly, I investigate how \nlocal entrepreneurs\u2019 business innovations and tourists\u2019 behaviour contribute to the \nsustainability of the Kinmen Brand. Lastly, I show that top-down branding efforts by the \ngovernment and bottom-up initiatives by local entrepreneurs, together with tourists\u2019 \nbehaviour are interrelated in a dialectical manner. In other words, the branding of \nKinmen is not merely a top-down process; the Kinmen Brand is a result of both top-down \n\u2018imagineering\u2019 efforts by the state and bottom-up initiatives by the locals and tourists. \nMoreover, the brand of an island constitutes its identity, and when used for tourism \npromotion, is supposed to conjure up a certain geographical image amongst the tourists. \nThe tourists\u2019 identification of an island has to be substantiated by locals\u2019 self-recognition \nwith the island\u2019s identity so as to sustain any branding effort. It is only with the \nrecognition and participation by the locals that an island\u2019s brand can be sustainable.  \n \n Research data for this paper is garnered from fieldwork conducted in Kinmen \nfrom May to July 2006 and again in December 2006. Respondents were divided into four \ngroups, namely the tourism officials, local entrepreneurs, Kinmen people and tourists. \nSemi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted. A total of ten representatives from \nboth the Kinmen County Government and Kinmen National Park (KMNP), the two main \n 7 \nplanners of Kinmen\u2019s battlefield tourism landscape, were interviewed. Insights were also \nbased on interviews with eight local entrepreneurs, whose business ventures were in one \nway or another related to Kinmen\u2019s battlefield tourism.8 Informal interviews proved to be \nuseful when interacting with local residents. Apart from the practicality of this method, \nthe informal setting made it possible for me to \u201cunderstand how individual people \nexperience and make sense of their own lives\u201d (Valentine, 2005: 111). Perceptions of the \nKinmen brand could also be gathered during friendly conversations with tourists. For a \nresearch that requires the analysis of brand experience, participant observation proved to \nbe useful. This was mainly conducted at the various war museums, battlefield sites and \nsouvenir shops where the Kinmen brand was created, promoted and experienced.  \n \n \n \n4.  Concepts and Conceptual Framework \n \nIn this exploratory paper, I attempt to conceptualise top-down branding efforts by the \ntourism planners and bottom up branding contributions by the local entrepreneurs, \nKinmen people and tourists in a dialectical manner. Figure 2 presents the conceptual \nframework of this paper. The arrows serve to represent the interaction amongst the \nvarious stakeholders in the creation of the Kinmen battlefield tourism brand. Thus, the \nIsland (Kinmen) Brand is conceptualised not as an end product by itself, but a dynamic \nand fluid imagination being constantly shaped and negotiated by state mandated branding \neffort as well as by locals and tourists.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n8\n For example operators of tour agencies and local entrepreneurs producing tourist souvenirs and products.    \n 8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe incorporation of emotion adds another dimension to the discussion as it \naffects the branding process. The study of emotions and feelings in geography is not \nnew.9 However, \u2018emotional geography\u2019 is of recent origin. In an influential editorial by \nAnderson and Smith (2001) in the Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers \nentitled \u201cEmotional Geographies\u201d, the authors highlight the importance of emotions in \nmaintaining geography\u2019s critical edge. Similarly, Davidson et al. (2005) edited a \ncollection of essays with the same theme. Observing an \u2018emotional turn\u2019 in geography \n                                                 \n9\n Early developments stem from the humanistic and behavioural schools. Tuan (1974) talks about \n\u2018topophilia\u2019 \u2013 the \u201caffective bond between people and place or setting\u201d (p. 4). Attempt to \u2018map\u2019 the feelings \nabout the urban environment (Spencer & Dixon, 1983) is also noticed. \nKinmen \nBrand \nT\no\np\n-d\no\nw\nn\n \nb\nra\nn\nd\nin\ng\n \nin\nitia\ntiv\ne\ns\n B\no\ntt\no\nm\n-u\np\n \nb\nr\na\nn\nd\nin\ng\n \np\nr\na\nc\nti\nc\ne\ns\n \n \nTOURISM PLANNERS \n \n \nLOCAL \nENTRPRENEURS; \nKINMEN PEOPLE; \nTOURISTS \n \nFigure 2 Tourist Destination Branding Model \n 9 \nand adopting a \u2018spatially engaged approach\u2019 to the study of emotions, the authors \narticulate that:  \n \nA genuine emotional geography cannot just deal in feelings\u2026 It must try \nto express something that is ineffable in such objectifying languages, \nnamely a sense of emotional involvement with people and places, rather \nthan emotional detachment from them\u2026 An emotional geography, then, \nattempts to understand emotion \u2013 experientially and conceptually \u2013 in \nterms of its socio-spatial mediation and articulation rather than as entirely \ninteriorised subjective mental states.                \n                                                                      (Davidson et al., 2005:2-3) \n \nIn his paper on \u201cThe place of emotions within place\u201d, Urry (2005) makes explicit the \nconnection between the \u2018tourist gaze\u2019 and \u2018emotional experience of place\u2019. He posits that \n\u201c[e]motions are intimately tied into place\u2026\u201d and \u201c[t]he practice of landscape entails an \nintangible resource\u201d, realised through the \u201cvisual consumption of place especially by \nthose \u2018touring\u2019\u201d (Urry, 2005: 77). For this paper, I pursue the spatiality of emotions in the \nbranding of Kinmen as a battlefield tourism destination.  \n \nAllen\u2019s (2003) arrangement of the \u2018brand experience\u2019 of a place into \u2018pre-place \nexperience\u2019, \u2018place-experience\u2019, and \u2018post-place experience\u2019 (incorporated into the \nTourist Destination Branding Model \u2013 Figure 2) provides a temporal-spatial perspective \nfor a more nuanced understanding of the branding process. He espouses that a tourist will \nbe exposed to the brand experience before, during and after the tour. Therefore, branding \ndoes not stay at the promotion level but takes place throughout the entire tour experience. \nAs such, branding efforts by both the tourism planners and the local entrepreneurs are \ndiscussed based on the three phases, with the former being more active and prominent in \nthe first two, and the latter contributing more significantly to the third.  \n \nI will now turn to the branding strategies adopted by the government to transform \nKinmen into a battlefield tourism destination, before shedding light on the contributions \nby local entrepreneurs, Kinmen people and tourists.  \n \n \n 10 \n5.  From Commemoration to Commercialisation \n \nAfter the lifting of martial law in 1992, the \u2018Battlefield Military Administration\u2019 was \nreplaced by a civilian county government. Kinmen was opened to tourism in the same \nyear; attracting the first Taiwanese tour groups to the island. A total of 247,264 tourists \nvisited Kinmen in 1993, and this increased two-fold to 531,683 in 1997 (Kinmen \nStatistics, 2006). Tourist arrivals consist mainly of domestic tourists from mainland \nTaiwan (78.5%), with the rest primarily represented by PRC tourists (21.3%) since the \nestablishment of the \u2018three mini links\u2019. Several reasons explain why people were attracted \nto Kinmen. As the battlefront of conflicts between PRC and Taiwan, Kinmen was \ninaccessible until 1992. The curious wanted to \u201csee it for themselves\u201d what Kinmen was \nreally like. Retired soldiers who had once served on the island also returned to reminisce \nthe past, usually with the company of family members. After the establishment of the \n\u2018three mini links\u2019, ferry services between Xiamen and Kinmen became available, and \ntourists from the PRC were keen to explore the \u201cmysterious military bastion\u201d that the \nPLA surprisingly failed to capture. The battlefield landscape that represented a bastion of \nmilitary might and symbol of war, was transformed almost overnight into a battlefield \nlandscape of appeal for tourist consumption.  \n  \n In 1995, KMNP, a subsidiary of the Taiwanese central government\u2019s Ministry of \nInterior, was established and joined ranks with the county government\u2019s tourism bureau \nas official planners of Kinmen\u2019s tourism landscape. Both agencies are referred here as \n\u2018tourism planners\u2019 as they have been actively involved in the transformation of Kinmen \nfrom a military stronghold to a tourist destination10 Military infrastructure and facilities \nthat were left behind by the shrinking garrison11 were rapidly re-appropriated to become \ntourist attractions. War museums are no longer just a place to commemorate the \u201cheroics\u201d \nof the KMT army, but became tourist attractions and sights of curiosity.  \n                                              \n \n                                                 \n10\n It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the possible conflicts between the county government and \nthe central government subsidiary.  \n11\n In line with the de-militarisation of Kinmen, the number of soldiers based on the island has been \nreducing from the initial 100,000 to the target of 5000. \n 11 \n6.  Branding Kinmen: Government\u2019s Initiatives \n \nAccording to Allen (2007: 64), government or quasi-governmental tourism agencies, as \nimportant players within the stakeholder tourism framework, \u201ctypically occupy a \nleadership role in constructing the marketing\/ brand framework\u201d. However, this is \napparent for Kinmen only in recent years. I would argue that branding efforts in terms of \nmarketing Kinmen island as a battlefield tourism destination is a phenomenon of late. As \nGao Shu-Zhen, Director of a local tour agency concurs:   \n \nThere is little need to market or brand the place during the early 90s when \nKinmen was opened for tourism. Tourists form Taiwan mainland arrived \nin flocks purely out of curiosity to see for themselves the military bastion \nthat they have long heard of but never been to. \n(Personal interview, 20 June 2006) \n \nNevertheless, a change in the central government\u2019s development strategies for \noff-shore islands leads to renewed interest in the battlefield identity of Kinmen. \nPreviously, a certain amount of development fund was appropriated by the central \ngovernment to an off-shore island according to its population. There was no monitoring \nof fund usage. This led to irresponsible and excessive spending in the construction sector. \nIn 2005, the central government shifted the administration of the off-shore Development \nFund from the Construction Bureau to the Council for Economic Development (Liu, \n2007). An Off-shore Islands Development Fund Office was subsequently set up to study \nthe unique characteristics and identity of each off-shore island, so as to determine its \ndirection of development. For Kinmen, the battlefield image was recognised as the most \nimportant character and this explains the current efforts by tourism planners to develop \nKinmen\u2019s battlefield tourism brand. The \u2018pre-place\u2019 branding strategies and \u2018place brand \nexperience\u2019 (Allen, 2003) are discussed in the following sections.  \n \n6.1  Pre-place branding strategies  \n \nMcLaren (1998: 27) describes the media as \u201cdream weavers and spin doctors\u201d.  After all, \ntourism is really about discovering or even creating a destination and then packaging and \nmarketing it. Conversely, Dann (1996) argues cogently that tourism can in fact be \n 12 \nconsidered a language. Here, I propose that images of tourist destinations found in the \nmedia constitute an imperative component to the language of tourism. Magnetic and \npowerful images can be compelling enough to fire the imagination and awake the desires \nof people (Cohen, 1982). Such is the utility of pre-place branding. Imaging results in \nlandscapes being promoted and commodified as \u201ctouristscapes\u201d. In the case of Kinmen, \nimages of its battlefield landscape appear in brochures (Plate 6.1), travel magazines, \nnewspapers, television commercials, the Internet (Plate 6.2) and even in books and films \n(Plate 6.3). Although appearing in diverse sources, these images only have one objective \n- to communicate to people, and in doing so, entice them to make the journey. Hence, \npotential tourists already possess a pre-place brand experience of battlefield Kinmen even \nbefore they set foot on the island. As Kotler et al. (2001) state, the unique positioning of \nHong Kong as a tourism destination, South Korea as an automotive stronghold and \nTokyo as a financial hub has been well publicised and entrenched through portrayals in \nprint and popular media. This testifies that a product, however unique, requires \ncommunication for strong brand equity to accumulate. \n \nI posit that because imaging is such a forceful art of persuasion, the commonality \nin portrayals of \u201cbattlefield\u201d in the popular media serves to shape and construct people\u2019s \nimaginings of Kinmen.  In other words, people are socialized into accepting and \nperpetuating the images of the \u2018tourist gaze\u2019 (Urry, 1990). As Urry (1990: 10) highlights, \ntourists are akin to semioticians, \u201creading the landscape for signifiers of certain pre-\nestablished notions or signs derived from various discourses of travel and tourism\u201d.  \nClearly then, when in contact with such popular media, tourists learn how, where and \nwhat to gaze as the pre-place brand unfolds.  These, I contend, are structured and \nmaintained by the images. Indeed, landscape realities are reinforced by branding. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nPlate 6.1 Tourist brochure advertising Kinmen\u2019s battlefield attractions \n(Source: http:\/\/tour.kinmen.gov.tw) \n \n \nPlate 6.2 Website on the latest battlefield attraction \u2013 The Kinmen Civil Defence Tunnel \n(Source: http:\/\/tour.kinmen.gov.tw) \n 14 \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6.2  The place brand experience \n \nThe branding of Kinmen does not stop at the promotion phase; the Kinmen brand is being \ncontinually created and experienced during the tour itself. As Kotler (2004: 12) argues, \n\u201cPlaces are more difficult to brand than products. Every place has a history and heritage \nthat will affect its image.\u201d Indeed, Kinmen is no tabula rasa. Like it or not, the \nquintessential identity of the island, lies not in the sun, sand and sea, or even the \naccidental preservation of its ecosystem made possible by minimal anthropogenic \ndisturbance during the martial law period; it is the battlefield heritage that breathes life \ninto the island\u2019s tourism landscape. Therefore, as tourism planners are \u201cconfronted by \nincreasing product parity, substitutability, and competition\u201d (Morgan et al., 2002, cited in \nAllen, 2007: 61), branding an island destination in terms of its geographical particularity \nand landscape identity becomes even more pertinent. Moreover, place brands \u201cshould \ninclude sensations and psychological traits that enrich the place\u2019s meaning and augment \nthe tourist\u2019s experience\u201d (Freire, 2005: 356). The following sections elucidate such \nexperiential aspects. \n \n \nPlate 6.3 A cinematic representation of the 1958 Artillery Battle (left) and Battlefield \nKinmen in a historical text (right) \n(Source: http:\/\/shopping.pchome.com.tw) \n \n 15 \n6.2.1  Placing memories: Reinforcing the Kinmen Brand in situ  \n \nOne of the strategies adopted by the tourism planners in creating \u2018place brand experience\u2019 \n(Allen, 2003) on Kinmen Island is to bring tourists to the actual battle sites. Such \n\u2018authenticity\u2019 not only appeals to the tourists but also allow the planners to take \nadvantage of the sites\u2019 emotional geographies and \u201cmultiple levels of sedimented history\u201d \n(Yeoh and Kong, 1996: 55, cited in Muzaini, 2004: 52). In particular, emotions could be \neffectively invoked when memories of the war years are triggered by the display of war \nrelics or narration of historical events in situ. Visitors \u201cnot only think about but also \u2018see\u2019 \nthe past\u201d (ibid). Visits to such sites then reinforce the battlefield brand as the relationship \nbetween the place and its \u201ccustomers\u201d is deepened (Allen, 2007). I shall use the example \nof Guningtou Battle Museum and various war relics to explicate.  \n \nThe Guningtou Battle Museum (Plate 6.4) was built in 1984 to commemorate the \nheroics of the KMT army during the battle of Guningtou in October 1949. The \ncommunists from Mainland China had attempted to capture the island, but to no avail \nafter 56 hours of deterrence by Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s forces. The museum was built at \nGuningtou where the battle was fought, and being \u201cthe first major KMT victory in many \nmonths of the long civil war, Guningtou became a symbol of the survival of the Republic \nof China (ROC) on Taiwan\u201d (Szonyi, 2005: 88).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPlate 6.4 Fa\u00e7ade of Guningtou Battle Museum \n 16 \n \n The presence of pillboxes, anti-parachuting fortresses and tankers surrounding the \nmuseum serves to cement the past for the present and add to the military ambience. Inside \nthe museum, tourists are greeted with a wall map that depicts the details of the Guningtou \nBattle, such as routes taken by the armed forces and the number of casualties suffered. \nThey are then directed by the tour guide to view a series of 13 murals (Plate 6.5). These \nlandscape paintings narrate the various events that took place before, during and after the \nbattle; concentrating on KMT\u2019s preparation for war, PLA\u2019s invasion, the fierce fighting \nthat took place, and the eventual surrender of the communist soldiers at Guningtou. \nCollectively, the artists apply their \u201cartistic and historical imaginations to the creation of \na glorious past\u201d (Osborne, 1992: 250). According to one of my informants, the venue and \ntime stated in the paintings \u201ccreate a kind of reality\u2026as though you are in the battle \nyourself\u201d (Taiwanese tourist; personal communication, 23 May 2006).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, a rectangular red carpet is laid in front of one of the paintings showing \nChiang Kai-shek surveying the Kinmen coastline (Plate 6.6). The tour guide would \nenthusiastically highlight that the red carpet area was the \u201cexact spot where the late \npresident stood in the painting\u201d. Undoubtedly, existential authenticity interacts with the \n \nPlate 6.5 One of the 13 murals on display \n 17 \n \nlocale to create an emotional experience, be it nationalistic or that of empathy, for the \nvisitors. This in turn reinforces Kinmen\u2019s battlefield tourism brand.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The Guningtou Battle museum tour ends with a coach ride to the \u2018Ancient \nBungalow\u2019 (depicted in the mural), the site where \u201cheavy street fighting\u201d took place. The \ndilapidated building bears the \u2018scars\u2019 of the battle, with bullet holes and destroyed \nsections of the wall still visible. A plaque stands in front of this war relic, narrating the \nfierce cross firing that took place there (Plate 6.7). As one of the tourists acknowledged, \n\u201cThis is what we saw just now in the mural. I can really feel what it was like back then\u2026 \ncan imagine that it was a fierce battle\u201d (Taiwanese tourist; personal communication, 23 \nMay 2006). This exemplifies the notion that \u201c[e]motions are intimately tied into place\u201d \n(Urry, 2005: 77), and a well of opportunity to utilise and manage emotional geographies \nin the island branding process. Concomitantly, the murals help to reinforce the emotional \ninteraction between tourists and the war relics.    \n \n \n \n \n \nPlate 6.6 Red carpet demarcating the exact spot where Chiang Kai-shek stood \n 18 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n In recent years, the battlefield brand of Kinmen has taken on a more diplomatic \napproach. Captions accompanying the paintings have been altered to \u201cprovide a more \nobjective version of the history and to show an increased sensitivity towards the PRC \ntourists\u201d (Huang Tzu-Chuan - Chief of Interpretation and Education Section, KMNP, \npersonal interview, 23 May 2006). The reference of the PLA as \u2018communist bandits\u2019        \n(\u5171\u532a), for example, has been changed to the more neutral term of \u201ccommunist soldiers\u201d \n(\u5171\u519b). Such a move attests to the idea of \u2018landscape as a palimpsest\u2019, where meanings \ncan be (re)inscribed (Duncan and Duncan, 1989) depending on the politics of \nconsumption. It is therefore evident that place branding does possess a \u2018public \ndiplomacy\u2019 fa\u00e7ade (Anholt, 2006).  \n \n6.2.2  Branding through simulation and simulacra   \n \nRe-creating war memories through simulation is another method adopted in producing \nthe place brand experience. For example, different forms of simulation are designed for \nvisitors at the Aug.23 Artillery Battle Museum (823 Museum)12 (Plate 6.8). It is a \u2018non \nplace-specific\u2019 memorial, built to remember the dead and provide detailed historical \nrecords of the artillery battle, which caused the residents to live in agony for 44 days \nunder heavy bombardment. A total of 474,910 shells fell on the island, creating \ndevastating destruction and loss of lives.       \n                                                 \n12\n Known as \u201c823 Museum\u201d because the artillery battle took place on 23 August 1958. \n \n \nPlate 6.7 Fierce fighting at the 'Ancient Bungalow\u2019 and as it stands today \n 19 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n Visitors are greeted with a series of historical photos and descriptions narrating \nthe battle. Also, small television screens show black-and-white footages of media \nreporting on the 1958 battle. These capture the visitors\u2019 attention and serve to substantiate \nthe photos by \u2018enlivening\u2019 history. As Muzaini (2004) has shown, photos and other \ngraphics can serve as a form of simulation, \u201cprovid[ing] \u2018visual markers\u2019 (Osborne, 1998) \nto help visitors imagine the past\u201d (p.56). In fact, in this case, visitors can go beyond \nimagining and literally see the past; allowing them to relate to the event easily. The \nsubtitles in the footages serve as \u2018text\u2019 for the tourism planners to effectively get their \nbrand message across.   \n \nMoving beyond the visual, the museum also attempts to re-create the lived \nexperience of the Kinmen locals \u2013 in the form of \u201cLife in the underground [bomb] \nshelters\u201d. A replica of a granite-carved bomb shelter is put on display, allowing visitors to \nenter and experience it. The photo showing a Kinmen resident seeking refuge testifies its \nauthenticity. A typical remark during my participant observation was that of senior \nmembers of Taiwanese tour groups reminding their children about the \u201cdifficult life back \nthen\u201d and \u201cnot to take the peace for granted\u201d. Therefore, verisimilitudes in the museum \nnot only serve as representations of the past in a physical sense, but also \u201cnon-verbal \n\u2018documents\u2019 in the landscape [that] can be powerful visual signs, conveying messages \nforcefully\u2026\u201d (Baker, 1992: 5). As seen from this example, Kinmen\u2019s battlefield brand is \n \nPlate 6.8 Fa\u00e7ade of 823 Museum \n \n 20 \nnot restricted to the tourism context; its identity is also engaged and rationalised by the \nadult tourists at the moral level to educate the young.  \n \nOf all the exhibits, the \u2018Battlefield Virtual Reality\u201d show is most popular. Instead \nof \u2018bringing\u2019 the past to the present, it \u2018brings\u2019 visitors back to the past in a room that \nprovides a 3-minute \u201cbattlefield experience\u201d. Visitors are presented with footages (on a \nscreen in front of them) of everyday peaceful life in Kinmen till the first artillery shell \nlanded. This is accompanied by sound and motion effects; simulating the tremors of the \nground, with explosions and cries filling the room. Such \u2018bombardment experience\u2019 \ntranscends the visual-centric displays earlier. It not only simulates history, but also \nstimulates the senses of the visitors, engaging them in a sensuous moment, entangling \nthem with miseries of the past, exploiting emotional geographies to the fullest! One of the \ntourists commented, \u201cThat was so real. I can really feel what it was like back then.\u201d \n(Taiwanese tourist; personal communication, 24 May 2006). Huang Tzu-Chuan \nexplained:  \n \nWe want our visitors to have a more encompassing experience. Not only \ncan they see the exhibits, they can also feel them. This way, it is easier for \nthem to empathise with the historical event. The school kids enjoyed it \n[the \u2018virtual reality\u2019] the most. We also want to educate them not to take \npeace for granted.13    \n(Personal interview, 23 May 2006) \n \nThe Rushan Old Barrack at the KMNP\u2019s headquarters is a vivid example that \nexplores the branding process through simulacra (i.e. exhibits that are not authentic but \nnevertheless having a strong resemblance to historical artefacts) . The military-themed \npark exhibits the various weapons used by the KMT army. A mixture of authentic and \nmodel weapons manned by wax soldiers with expressions of anxiety, form the \nbackground to the staged battle (Plate 6.9). Green-coloured sand bags, camouflaged walls \nand a command centre mimicking the \u201cactual situation during war times\u201d create the \nsetting of a barrack. At regular intervals, audio effects of bombing and air raid sirens \nwould be played to add to the ambience.  \n                                                 \n13\n Disneyland uses similar tactics to bring an idealised past or dangerous present to consumers in a safe way.  \n 21 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nVisitors, both locals and tourists can be seen \u201cparticipating\u201d in the pseudo battle \nby posing playfully with the wax figures or helping the gunners \u201cload\u201d their guns. Such \ncaricature of battle scenes marks a different approach in the production of Kinmen\u2019s \nplace brand experience as discussed hitherto. In fact, the boundaries between the \nauthentic and inauthentic are blurred in the production of the tourism landscape. When \ninterviewed, Su Cheng-Chi, Chief of KMNP\u2019s Planning and Management Department, \nreplied:  \n \nThis is an interesting way to let the people interact with the exhibits. In \nfact, if this is successful, we have plans to develop the whole island into a \ntheme park, concentrating on providing tourists with battlefield \nexperience. We can let the tourists put on our army uniform, eat army \nfood, and re-enact the battle. We can even integrate with paint ball games, \nsomething that is popular amongst the youngsters nowadays. We can also \nprovide photo-taking services and if they are interested, they can purchase \nthe uniform, as a souvenir.  \n(Personal interview, 2 June 2006)         \n \n \n \nPlate 6.9 Wax figures \u201cmanning\u201d various weapons at the Rushan Old Barrack \n 22 \nApparently, the production of battlefield tourism landscape through re-creating the war \nmemories is increasingly being commercialised; through various simulacra focusing on \nthe touristic experience rather than authenticity of display. Indeed, the \u201cimage takes over \nthe original\u201d (Eco, 1986, cited in Freire, 2005: 355) for such fabricated events (Boorstin, \n1992). When asked for his view on the possible \u2018de-sacralisation\u2019 of the former \nbattlefield through such staged authenticity (MacCannell, 1976), General (retired) Liao, \nwho has served on Kinmen before, begged to differ: \n \nWe have to change with the times. Although I strongly feel that we should \nmaintain vigilant and that the young generation should still possess a war \nmentality, there is nothing to stop the state from achieving this through the \n\u2018fun\u2019 way. National education can be taught using the \u2018fun\u2019 method. \nMaybe it is more effective. \n(Personal interview, 4 July 2006) \n \nTherefore, the branding of Kinmen\u2019s battlefield landscape not only possesses underlying \ngeopolitical agenda, but also considers consumers\u2019 preferences. Indeed, the symbolic \nsignificance of the Kinmen Brand takes precedence over the authenticity of historical \nreproduction in modern day consumption. Furthermore, as Kotler et al. (2001: 318) \nhighlight, \u201cglossy photographs of sunsets, beaches, buildings and events need to have \nsome relationship to what tourists actually experience; otherwise places run the risk of \nlosing tourist goodwill and generating bad word of mouth\u201d. The excellent attractions \nportray the battlefield image strongly. This not only provides Kinmen with its unique \nselling point but also facilitates strong and convincing branding. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 23 \n7.  Of Kaoliang, Bullets and Knives: Local Entrepreneurs, Kinmen People and    \nTourists as Branding Agents \n   \nBranding of Kinmen by the tourism planners alone has its limitations. Although it may be \nsuccessful amongst the tourists, the locals themselves need to identify with the brand of \nthe island as a battlefield tourism destination. I argue that tourists\u2019 identification of an \nisland should be substantiated by locals\u2019 self-recognition with the island\u2019s identity so as \nto sustain any tourism branding effort. It is only with the recognition and participation by \nthe locals that tourism can be sustainable. In this case, the locals should be given more \nautonomy in shaping their battlefield tourism landscape. This serves to inculcate a more \nintimate sense of place and self-recognition amongst the Kinmen people. The following \nsection provides a glimpse of how local entrepreneurs, Kinmen locals and tourists are \nalso branding agents of Battlefield Kinmen.      \n      \n As Allen (2007: 64) argues, \u201cWhile government agencies often lead brand \ninitiatives, the stakeholder domains within which they operate are arguably more difficult \nto manage than those faced by corporate brand managers.\u201d In the case of Kinmen, other \nthan the official planners, local entrepreneurs also play a major role in shaping the \nbattlefield tourism brand by investing their own sentiments through the commodification \nof war symbolism. People go beyond the functional features when purchasing a product \nand \u201cacquire certain symbolic features that are incorporated in the brand\u201d (Aaker, 1996, \ncited in Freire, 2005: 347). I refer to the Kinmen te-chan (\u7279\u4ea7- specially produced \nconsumer items) and how these products are marketed and consumed in accordance to \nthe battlefield image of Kinmen. The \u201cthree treasures\u201d of Kinmen, namely Kinmen \nKaoliang (sorghum) Liquor (\u91d1\u95e8\u9ad8\u7cb1\u9152), Kinmen Peanut Candy (\u91d1\u95e8\u8d21\u5510) and the \nKinmen Steel Knife (\u91d1\u95e8\u94a2\u5200) will be drawn upon to elaborate.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 24 \n7.1  The Kinmen kaoliang liquor   \n \nThe consumption culture of kaoliang liquor started in North China. When the KMT \nforces retreated from PRC to Kinmen, the military brought with them the consumption \nhabit and introduced growing of sorghum to the residents.14 The liquor has since become \nthe most important export commodity and is inextricably linked to the island\u2019s battlefield \nidentity. With the rise of tourism, local entrepreneurs have since come up with \n\u2018commemorative liquor\u2019 featuring the major battles for tourist consumption. The bottles \ncome in the shape of tankers, helmets, army boots and artillery shells, marrying the \nconsumption of kaoliang liquor with war commemoration (Plate 7.1).  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n14\n This is an over simplification of the history of Kaoliang liquor. For a detailed description, see Szonyi \n(forthcoming).  \n \n \n \n \nPlate 7.1 Commemorative Kaoliang liquor in various shapes \n \n 25 \n The association of kaoliang liquor with the battlefield identity of Kinmen sets off \na co-branding relationship. The kaoliang liquor is no longer just any liquor made from \nsorghum; it is \u201cKinmen Kaoliang Liquor\u201d. Such a brand name \u201cadd[s] value to the basic \nproduct (brand equity)\u2026 and this [battlefield image] provides differentiation that goes \nbeyond price competition\u201d (Aaker, 1991, cited in Donald and Gammack, 2007: 46). \nConcomitantly, the kaoliang liquor, high in its alcohol content and believed to be only \nconsumed by the strong and courageous, is also a brand in itself, which underscores the \ncharacter of Kinmen as a military stronghold. The significance of \u2018Kinmen\u2019 and \n\u2018Kaoliang\u2019 as co-brands is evident from a Taiwanese tourist\u2019s response:  \n \nI bought this bombshell-bottled Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor as a souvenir for \nmy brother. For one, Kinmen is famous for its high quality kaoliang liquor. \nMoreover, the battlefield aspect of this island is represented by the \nbombshell bottle. People will know straight away that I have visited \nKinmen. So, I am hitting two birds with one stone. I don\u2019t mind paying \nmore for the design.  \n(Personal communication, 2 June 2006) \n \nAs can be seen from this example, the symbolic consumption of the kaoliang liquor gives \nthe local entrepreneurs an edge over other producers. Indeed, brand equity is effective in \nreducing the price sensitivity of a product. \n \n During my stay in Kinmen, it was not difficult to notice rows of such \ncommemorative kaoliang liquor on display in the living rooms of locals\u2019 residences. One \nof the locals enthused when asked about the display:  \n \nThese kaoliang liquor bottles encapsulate Kinmen\u2019s battlefield history. \nMoreover, they are quite nice and unique\u2026Something to show to friends \nand relatives when they visit us from Taiwan. So, this has become \nsomething like a hobby for me\u2026collecting these bottles.  \n(Personal interview, 22 June 2006)   \n \nThe branding of Kinmen has indeed crossed the domain of tourism planners into that of \nthe local people. In fact, Donald and Gammack (2007) have highlighted the importance \nof \u201cevery citizen [being] an ambassador\u201d and believing in the brand, as the key difference \n 26 \nbetween product and place branding (p. 61). For a successful and sustainable branding \neffort, the Kinmen locals must believe in the battlefield identity themselves. If this \ncriterion is fulfilled, the people can be utilised as \u201cthe most powerful communication tool \nin the [island] branding toolbox (Gudjonsson, 2005: 288). As such, by collecting and \ndisplaying the commemorative kaoliang liquor, the Kinmen locals can be seen as \u201cbrand \nstewards\u201d (Allen, 2007) in promoting and sustaining the battlefield brand.  \n \n \n7.2  The Kinmen Peanut Candy \n \nThe peanut candy is one of the Kinmen delicacies popular amongst tourists. The local \nentrepreneurs are quick to jump onto the bandwagon of battlefield tourism development \nto come up with war-related themes for the peanut candy. However, they are not passive \nfollowers, but make use of tourism to express their own interpretation of the battlefield \nlandscape. For instance, Mr Chen, General Manager of Min-Jih Gong Tang, invented the \n\u201cBullet Cracker\u201d series (Plate 7.2). These crackers take the shape of bullets and are \nspecially packed in containers that resemble ammunition boxes. On explaining his \nrationale for creating these products, he enthused: \n \nI wanted these peanut candies to represent peace between Taiwan and \nPRC. These bullet-shaped peanut crackers symbolise those bullets that \nwere left behind after the war. We don\u2019t want anymore conflict, so the \nbest way to deal with these excess bullets, is to eat them! The tourists love \nthem. Moreover, people here are also finding this to be the perfect gift for \nrelatives and friends who come over\u2026usually for them to bring back to \nTaiwan. I am in the midst of designing more of such candy. Peanut candy \nin the forms of tankers, machine guns and grenades will be next.   \n \n(Personal interview, 1 June 2006) \n \n Entrepreneurial innovations such as the Bullet Crackers, when bought by the \ntourists and locals as souvenirs, contribute to the post-place brand experience (Allen, \n2003) of Kinmen. In this case, they help to perpetuate the Kinmen battlefield brand by \npurchasing these souvenirs and giving them as gifts to relatives and friends overseas. For \nexample, when asked the reason for purchasing the bullet crackers, one PRC tourist \nreplied:  \n 27 \nI bought it for fun, not really for the taste. It is interesting and I like the \npeace agenda behind its creation. This serves as a very good souvenir for \nmy friends back home. Who would have thought that you can actually eat \na bullet!      \n(Personal communication, 1 June 2006) \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nObviously, the bullet crackers were bought for their symbolic meaning rather than its \ntaste. Although \u2018piggy-backing\u2019 on the government\u2019s branding initiative, the local \nentrepreneurs are actively expressing their agency in the branding process by creating \ntheir own narration behind the products, which acts as a medium for relaying their own \ninterpretation of Kinmen\u2019s battlefield landscape.  \n \n \nPlate 7.2 \u201cBullet\u201d Cracker \n(Source: Min Jih promotional booklet) \n 28 \n Such a marriage between a cultural product and the battlefield brand provides \nopportunities for the local community to \u201cdevelop and create cultural signs and markers \nthat will be needed to attract visitors\u201d (MacCannell, 1999, cited in Freire, 2005: 360). \nThis is especially crucial for product differentiation, considering the fact that the \nneighbouring island of Xiamen has started to produce its own peanut candy targeted at \ntourists. Xiamen is the port of call for many Kinmenese tourists and the place of origin of \nPRC tourists visiting Kinmen, since the establishment of the \u2018mini-three links\u2019. During \nmy recent fieldtrip to Xiamen Island, I noticed that there are many (\u7279\u4ea7) shops selling \ncultural food products along the major thoroughfares at the Zhongshan tourist district \n(Plate 7.3). The peanut candy is obviously a cultural product not confined to the Kinmen \nterritories, considering that both Kinmen and Xiamen belong to the Southern Fujian \nregion at least in cultural terms. Kinmen Peanut Candy is exported and sold alongside \nXiamen Peanut Candy in these shops. In order to profit from a more successful product \ndifferentiation, the battlefield brand as perceptible in innovations like the \u201cbullet \ncrackers\u201d ought to be utilised. It is by bringing the Kinmen battlefield brand to the world \nthat tourists from around the world would be attracted to the island.        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPlate 7.3 Zhongshan tourist district (left) and shop selling Kinmen Peanut \nCandy alongside other cultural food products from Xiamen Island \n \n 29 \n7.3  The Kinmen Steel Knife  \n \nThe Kinmen Steel Knife 15  is even more closely related to the war (Plate 7.4). \nManufactured using the artillery shells that fell on the island during the bombardment by \nthe communist forces during the Cold War years, it has gained popularity all over the \nworld, and is often featured in media reports and documentaries. Major television \nnetworks like CNN from the United States, NHK from Japan and TVBS from Taiwan, \nand international magazines like TIME, all have had special reports on the \u201cChin Ho Li \nSteel Knife Story\u201d.  According to Mr Wu, Director of Chin Ho Li,16  \n \nThe kitchen knife is used in every household\u2026both in PRC and Taiwan. I \nwant to remind people of the great sufferings caused by the battle. At the \nsame time, this common household item would also remind the users of \nthe kinship and culture that both sides share. We are ultimately one family.   \n   \n  (Personal interview, 29 May 2006)   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n15\n Although famous for its kitchen knives, souvenir knives of varying sizes are also available.  \n16\n \u201cChin Ho Li\u201d is the name Mr Wu\u2019s Kinmen Steel Knife factory. \n \n \nPlate 7.4 The Kinmen steel knife made from artillery shells \n(Source: Chin Ho Li Steel Knife promotional brochure) \n \n 30 \nIn this example of the Kinmen Steel Knife, the battlefield brand is skilfully \nembedded in its creation. It might not be articulating the Kinmen brand as explicitly as \nthe two consumables discussed above. However, coupled with its functionality and \ndurability, the knife can be an effective \u201cbrand agent\u201d in the long run. With continuing \ninnovations in design and product development, the Kinmen Steel Knife is gradually \ntransforming itself into an umbrella brand that hosts a series of souvenir knives that will \ncertainly meet the preferences of different tourists.  \n \nThe Chin Ho Li example illustrates how Kinmen\u2019s battlefield brand can also be \nshaped through the production of consumer items by a local entrepreneur. The knife \nreminds the tourist of the existing conflict between PRC and Taiwan and conveys the \nmessage for peaceful reconciliation. Such product innovations serve as a medium for the \nlocal entrepreneurs to express their sentiments about the war and how they would like the \nwar to be represented to the tourists.  \n \n The \u201cthree treasures\u201d of Kinmen illustrate the production and consumption of \nKinmen\u2019s battlefield brand in a symbolic sense. They show how tourist consumption of \nsuch te-chan can interact with locals\u2019 interpretation of Kinmen\u2019s battlefield past, and \nwhen bought home, contribute to the perpetuation of the battlefield brand beyond \nKinmen\u2019s geographical limits. Therefore, the battlefield tourism brand is constitutive of \nand at the same time constituted by the locally produced goods. It is evident that local \nentrepreneurs, Kinmen people and tourists do contribute in one way or another to the \npost-place brand experience of Kinmen. Being a small, developing destination with \nlimited resources, such Kinmen souvenirs serve as \u201ccreative and cost-efficient\u201d (Florek \nand Conejo, 2007) branding avenues. According to Morgan (2004: 19), tourism remains a \n\u201chighly involving experience, extensively planned, excitedly anticipated and fondly \nremembered. Souvenirs and mementos evoke and materialise those experiences\u2026\u201d \nIndeed, the Kinmen brand travels to places out of Kinmen when products created by the \nlocal entrepreneurs are bought as souvenirs by either the locals themselves or by tourists. \nSuch behaviour starts off another cycle of \u2018pre-place experience\u2019 and helps in the \nattraction of more tourists to Kinmen. The post-place brand experience is thus an \n 31 \nimportant aspect in the branding process as it contributes significantly to the perpetuation \nand sustainability of the Kinmen brand.   \n \n The effectiveness of the te-chan in perpetuating the battlefield image has been \nrecognised by the tourism planners as they are increasingly being featured in promotional \nmaterials about Kinmen. This shows how \u2018bottom-up\u2019 branding practices may influence \n\u2018top-down\u2019 decisions, thus breaking away from a dichotomous understanding of planners \nand locals of the battlefield landscape. The Kinmen Brand then should be conceptualised \nas \u201ca negotiated reality, a social construction by a purposeful set of actors\u201d (Ley, 1981, \ncited in Ringer, 1998: 5). Socially, island branding in and through tourism provides a \nplatform for constructing a common identity and a sense of belonging amongst the \nislanders. Indeed, the manufacturing and sales of locally produced products can become a \n\u201csource of pride that may be more deep-rooted than the ephemeral satisfaction of \nattracting inward investment\u201d (Dinnie, 2004: 109). In economic terms, the many places \nfrom which the tourists originate and where the Kinmen Brand is promoted, experienced \nand perpetuated, become viable economic hinterlands of Kinmen Island  \n \n8.  Conclusion: An eye on the future \n \nAlthough tourism is just a component part of island branding, it is integral to the support \nand promotion of the island brand. This paper has attempted to highlight the intricacies of \nthe island branding process by explicating contributions by the various tourism \nstakeholders in a dialectical manner. Through the different phases of brand experience, \nnamely pre-place, place and post-place (Allen, 2003), I have shown that the Kinmen \nbrand is a negotiated reality; it is a dynamic organism that feeds on both top- down \nbranding initiatives by the tourism planners and bottom-up practices by local \nentrepreneurs, Kinmen people and tourists. Considering the political nature of place \nbranding in terms of the vested interests in portraying particular images, I have also \nproposed the importance of locals\u2019 recognition with the island\u2019s identity so as to sustain \nthe branding efforts. Meanwhile, the various case studies discussed espouse the \npertinence of geographical particularity and landscape identity in the branding of \nKinmen, so as to avoid the \u2018homogenising effect\u2019 of a singular \u2018imagineering\u2019 and\/or \n 32 \ngeographical imagination of \u2018island tourism\u2019. Tourists of today do not merely travel to \nescape from their daily routine; they also yearn for new experiences (Iso-Ahola, 1982). \n\u201cThese new experiences emerge only if local places maintain their characteristics, culture \nand individuality\u201d (Gnoth et al., 2000, cited in Freire, 2005: 357). Therefore, if an island \ndestination is not considered as different, it will lose its appeal.  \n \nIn terms of marketing, Kotler et al. (2001) argue that with budget constraints, the \nclear definition of target segments will allow focused branding efforts in relevant media \nchannels. As elaborated above, Kinmen is mainly visited by domestic tourists. The \nexcellent products make it easier to create a place image and eventually, a strong brand \nwithin this specific segment. More effort should be spent on publicising in appropriate \ncommunication channels to reach out to this segment. Market research will be required to \nshed light on the target audiences, media usage and place image. This will complement \nthe existing product to create a strong destination brand. Conversely, the emerging \nmarket of PRC tourists will require increased sensitivity to a different audience \n(Henderson, 2007). This includes catering to their needs and more importantly, sensitivity \nto the branding message. While the brand for the domestic market can emphasize \npatriotism and nationhood arising from the war, such messages need to be toned down for \nthe PRC market.  \n \n To close, I would like to speculate on the future of the Kinmen brand and the \nbranding process. To do this, we have to ask ourselves: Will the historical \ncontextualisation of the island still be pivotal to the brand, or will it be downplayed? The \nanswer to this question lies in Taiwan\u2019s political climate vis-\u00e0-vis PRC\u2019s attitude towards \nits perceived unclaimed territory of Taiwan. There are at least three scenarios that could \nbe discussed:  \n \n\u2022 Taiwan under the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) \n\u2022 Taiwan under the pro-status quo and economic-driven Kuomintang (KMT) \n\u2022 Taiwan after re-unification with PRC.  \n \n 33 \n First, considering the attempt by the ruling DPP to \u2018de-Sinicise\u2019 Taiwan early last \nyear17 (The Straits Times, 30 January 2007; 9 February 2007), it would be a matter of \ntime that the military island of Kinmen would experience the political ripples. If this were \nto happen, the historical context of the island will be downplayed in an attempt to severe \nhistorical ties with PRC altogether. However, the fact that Kinmen remained untouched \nthroughout the de-Sinicisation campaign hints on DPP\u2019s preference to portray the \nmilitary island as a symbolic representation of the formal separation of Taiwan from PRC \nand the establishment of an independent political entity. In this case, the battlefield brand \nwill remain relevant for the promotion of Kinmen\u2019s tourism.  \n \n In the second scenario, the KMT will most likely strengthen Kinmen\u2019s economic \nties with the Chinese Mainland. The mini-three links that is currently restricted to the \nFujian province on the PRC side might be expanded to cover more provinces. A large in-\nflux of PRC tourists is expected and the diplomatic fa\u00e7ade of the battlefield brand as \ndiscussed earlier is likely to be more prevalent. In such a situation, the Kinmen brand will \nbe particularly important in attracting tourists and inward investments.  \n \n Finally, in the event of re-unification, the battlefield image of Kinmen will still be \nmaintained by the Chinese authorities. Other than the possibility of utilising Kinmen as a \nlaunch pad for stronger socio-cultural, economic and political ties with Taiwan, the island \ncould be developed into a national education site to remind its people of the separation \nhistory and the tedious effort by the Chinese authorities in reclaiming its final unclaimed \nterritory. With a war museum and military theme park already operating on the islet of \nDa Deng off Xiamen Island, there is little reason why Kinmen will not be incorporated \ninto the larger plan for a \u2018national education tourism corridor\u2019.    \n \n In my opinion, the second scenario has the highest possibility of being \nmaterialised. In almost every possible scenario, the battlefield brand of Kinmen remains \ncentral for the island\u2019s development and continual survival. Therefore, it is indeed \nadvantageous in both the near future and long run that tourism planners and local \n                                                 \n17Examples include the editing of high school history textbooks to downplay historical ties with PRC, \nreplacing \u201cChina\u201d with \u201cTaiwan\u201d on the stamps, and a proposal to keep away statues of Chiang Kai-shek.   \n 34 \nentrepreneurs continue to invest on the battlefield brand of Kinmen. Contemporary \nefforts by tourism planners and local entrepreneurs to portray a less contested history \nbetween Taiwan and PRC, and a desire for peaceful settlement of their conflicts are \nwelcomed. It is hoped that Kinmen, as a battlefield tourism destination, can function as a \nplatform for people from both sides of the straits to understand better their past, and more \nimportantly, that they are inextricably related to one another; socially and economically, \nif not politically. The island is thus envisioned to be a bridge for a much desired peaceful \nsettlement of the ongoing political instability on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.  \n \n \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements  \n \nThis paper appeared in its earlier form as a presentation at the Inaugural Meeting of the \nIGU Commission on Islands: \u2018Island Geographies\u2019 International Conference, Taipei \n(Taiwan) in October 2007.
