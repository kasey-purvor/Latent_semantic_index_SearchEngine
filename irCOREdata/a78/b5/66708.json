Above all, it shows itself to be the heir to\nthe dominant idea ofninereenth-century aesthetics, and the concept to which\nall others can be seen to relate: the autonomy-charaeterofmusic.lt is the aim of\nthis chapter to explore this concept and its cluster ofrelated ideas.\nAutonomy, expression and the decline of\nRomanticism\nAn music, whicb had detached itself historically from any direct social func-\ntion, was generally understood as the ultimate vehicle for a ~ftoating,\ninward-looking subjectivity which, in the absence ofconcepts and representa-\ntion, referred only to itself. Hegel, whose influence spanned the century, and\nwhose attitude to Romanticism was distincdy ambivalent, had proposed that\n<the keynote of Romantic art is musialf.J As Sanna Pederson has pointed out,\nhowever, <Hegel seemed to disuust this emancipation from extemaJ reference,\nwhich could also imply a lack ofspiritual content'.4 for Hegel, music was prob-\nlematical because ofits indeterminateness, and it was <conccmcd only with the\ncompletely indeterminate movement of the inner spirit and with sounds as if\ntbey were feeling without thought'.s The problem articulated by Hegel in his\nBerlin Lectures on Aesthetics in the 18ws (which were published posthu-\nmously in 1842 and continued to resonate in the second halfofthe century) bad\na considerable legacy for all the arts, as the example from Huysmans's novcl\nshows. It also had a pre-history (see chapter 1)which is ofrelevance to the later\npart ofthe century, and with which there are certain parallels.\nWhile in the first half of the nineteenth century there arose the notion of\nabsolute music which laid claim to the metaphysical peaks of human experi-\nence as a language ofthe emotions beyond the reach ofconceptual thought, it\nis also important to recognise that the dominance ofthe concept ofautonomy\nand of the idea of absolute music were by no means total. Opera, oratorio,\nballet, salon and <trivial music' continued to occupy proportionately far greater\nnumbers than symphonic and chamber music for the m of the ninetemtb-\ncentury music-loving public. To an extent, therefore, it must be argued that\nthe idea of music as an art existing in and for itsdf has to be understood in\nthis period not simply as the dominating aesth tic ideal, but as a metlpb t-\n3 G.

This applies not only to so-called 'absolute' music, as\ninsuumental music without words, but also to its extension into the theatre in\nthe form of the Wagnerian music drama. where the expansion through con-\ncepts is designed to achieve a cogniti~ statuS previously denied to music by\nKmt and Hegellndccd,one can CYCl1 include here the invol\\ICIDent ofautono-\nmous music in ninc=nth-ccntury Nationalism in the conteXt of the creation\nof national identities. To put it in Wagner's termS, music 'comes of age',\nbecomes mature and aware of itselfand its conteXt - a conteXt which includes\nboth an invol~ment of an with politics and society and, equally, the reucat\nfrom any obvious sense of social invol~mcnt. Wagner, unlike Hegel, saw\nBctthovcn as the touchstone for this process of'coming ofage', calling him in\nhis essay 'The Art-work of the Future' (149), 'the Masttr, who was caIIcd to\nwrite upon his works the 'AII1rld-ltistory ofMIlSi\u00a3', and who saw the ncccssiry 'to\nfituJ OKIfur JWruefftire CO\/DItry oftire MaaJiood oftire FIlbm'.\u00b7 Music, with its long\nassociation with metaphors of language, bccomcs regarded as a lcind of lan-\nguage without concepts, a form of 'concepdcss cognition'.\nWhile for much ofthe century this process also goes in parallel with the xs-\nthctics ofexpression, as is seen in the rapturousdaims ofWackenrodcr, Herder\nand E. T. A. Hoffmann and in the music journalism ofcomposers like Weber,\nBerlioz and Schumann, iulso led to a tension bctwttn 'form' and 'cxpression',\nbetween the immanent formalist relations ofmusical stnICtUre and the need to\njustify music's frtt-f1oating, dynamic exprcssiviry with rcfclt:llce to an object\nexterior to it. By the mid-ccntury composers were scdting to anchor musical\ncxpression in more concrete u:rms in the cxua-musical - in literary pro-\ngrammes, dramatic narnti~ gesture, Romantic notions of nature and of\nnational identity (the cwo Iann frcquendy linked through evocations of folk\nand community). Wagner's theories of music drama and GtsII1ft~*\nplayed a key role in this process, which was essentially the atttmpt to soI~ the\nproblem of absolute music's non-ronccptual characttt. Nietzsche, who ini-\ntially lOOk his CIIC from Wagner in ne Birt1I of7rrt8edy (1872) but then rcja:n:d\nhim, together with their mutual source of inspiration Arthur Schopcnbaucr,\nwent on to conaibute funhcr thoughts towards the clarification of this\n6 IUchaId w.......llt_fl..._..Jc\u00bbnMlris, ...ftL W. _ EJl;, n.-do, Ndor.ud\n,_.199)l.pp. \"). tt, (laIia Ie\"\";noI).\n32.1 MAX 'ADDISON\nproblem in his HILmll1f, All Too HJLmIl1f (1878). I shall discuss this in more detail\nlater in this chapter.\nRight from the beginning of the century, however, there are two distinctly\ndifferent emphases that can be identified, each with quite different implica-\ntions for the second halfof the century. The first ofth~ is located around the\nnew aesthetics ofexpression (as opposed to the older aesthetics ofmusic, like\nthat ofSulzer, which was really a development from the doctrine ofaffections,\na theory which had lasted right up to the late eighteenth century). This new aes-\nthetics ofexpression from the orly nineteenth century is essentially an aesthet-\nics of content, where the content in question could be understood as the\nsensitive listener's own emotional response to the music, or, to put it another\nway, as the inner world ofthe listener shaped by the dynamic temporal unfold-\ning of the music, as 'sounding inwardness'. It is first associated with\nWackenrodcr, then with the powerful twist given to the idea by Schopenhauer.\nThe second emphasis from this period is located around a new aesthetics of\nmusical form, and is initially associated with Friedrich von Schlegd,and laterat\nthe mid-cenrury with the decisive contribution ofEduard Hansliclc.\nThe delayed influence of Schopenbauer's dualistic metaphysics of expres-\nsion, together with Han lick's formalist critique of mu ical expressivity, also\nserved paradoxicaJly to reinforce the autonomy-characrer ofmusic, in spite of\nthe fierce debates to which the two positions gave rise at the time. By the end of\nthe century the concept ofautonomy had also come to embrace lite.rature in its\nretreat from referentiality, particuJarly through the contradictory but all-\nencompassing influence ofWagner on the ymbolists reinfora:d by the recep-\ntion of Baudelaire and the R.evu W~biennt. ubsequently painting is also\ndrawn into the orbit ofmu ic in a seemingly inexorable rno from representa-\ntion toWards increasing abstraction (something to be seen in the paintings of\nKJimt and in particular in the BJu.e Rider AlmmrIU of 1911 and the interaction\nbetween Kandinsky and Schocnberg).7\nIt would, however, be a considerable oversimplification to see the progress of\nthe idea ofautonomy, ofabsolute music, as an unbroken line ofdcv lopmcnt\nwhich swept through the ninm:rnth century without d' ruption and without\nany change ofcharacter, from the Idealism ofWack.cnroder and Sch J1jng at its\nbeginnings to the muted poetic Symboli m ofMallarm~and Pater at itsftl de\nsieck. The concept ofautonomy, crntra1 as it is to nincternth-century musi\nneeds to be understood as one ofa cluster ofideas which an serve illu-\nminate the underlying music aesthetics ofthe period when taken an ensem-\nble, albeit an ensemble of oppositions. The nineteenth century, particularly\n7 Cf. JcXna tbhl-Kodt (nt.), 1\u00a5Ut:ra-Kat6 .Ltttm Cloedon., , ).\nMusic as ideal: the aesthetics ofautDllomy\ngiven the remarkable dissemination of German philosophical thinking\nthroughout Europe and North America, is the age ofthe dialectic. The philos-\nophy of Hegel, which had itself grown out of the attempt to systematise the\nfragmenary speculative insights of the early Romantics on the nature ofsub-\njectivity through a fusion with the critical rationality of Kant's philosophy,\nt2ught the century to think ofunity and totality in terms ofa dynamic logic of\ncontradiction and opposition. Given the all-perv.ading presence of Hegel's\nthinking, and the extent to which it functions as the modus opertVUli of\nRomantic aesthetics and music theory, it would therefore seem entirely appro-\npriate to take a dialectical approach to the discussion of the ideas themselves,\nand to the unCOVt:ring ofthcir underlying ideology, that oforganicism. Thus it\ni the complex, frequendy contradictory, but extremely fruitful interaction of\nthese ideas that is striking in the musical aesthetics of this period. As well as\nembracing such apparendy polarised extremes as the aesthetics ofexpression\nand the mid-century arguments in support offormalism, they are also charac-\nterised by the extreme ingularity ofautonomous music and the ambitions for\nthe fusion of the arts; the aesthetics of'inwardn \" for which autonomous\nmusic serves as the paradigm, and an outer world dominated increasingl as the\ncentury progresses by therommerciaJisation and industrialisation ofthe public\narena. Connected with thi , there are the spiritual claims made for art, and for\nmusic in particular, conU'aSttd with the rmteriaJism ofsociety at large and the\npositivi m ofscientific mC'thod. And impof\"tandy, there is the social context of\nall thi to be taken into account: the new cI relations which emerge with\nRomantic' ~ associated with the~ of the bourgeoisie, whose view ofthc\nworld it initially celebraas but which it thentums a.gaiost after the mid-\ncentury.\nRomanticism, in the met2ph kal sense in which it bad been understood at\nthe bcginnin of the nineteenth century, was alre:ady in decline by the 1840s.\nThe twO opposing a meric positions identified here the aesthetics of\ne pinand the acstheti ofform persist through this dcc1ine, but cake on a\ndiffocntcbaracttr.The6 tbecom in~arefocusingoftheaestbcti of\nfedin roward what has been called variusly neo-roltWlticism and emotional\nReaUsm, cb by eroti sen ualism and the attempt to ataeh the\nap i n ofddinitr emo ' to the exm\u00b7musicaJ. 10 sccood gi to\nthe apparendy anti-cxp n tbctic of funn.aJ\u00b7 m with i insisttnce that\nmusic i inapab~ of the direct up ion of em ti wha:hcr definiU: or\nindcfinitr ( lth ugh it' d tabl that this r reall c tituted a uinel\nami\u00b7p n nee, in the in which thi became im rt:an~ fur\nmplc, in th~ n lcism th~ M'eOticth .ntury). I h.aJ1 add this\nndid n, the rmar in d it later through an minati n of\nMAX PADDISON\nHanslick's argument in On the Beautiful in Music. First I shall consider the exten-\nsion ofthe aesthetics ofexpression at the mid-century.\nThe subsequent development of the aesthetics of expression from a meu-\nphysical intO a more literal and, indeed, 'physical' or concrete form i associated\nwith the ew German School ofWagner and Liszt, and with the development\nofthe music drama and the symphonic poem (~chapters 11 and 14 for fuller\ndiscussion). The musical origin ofthis so-called neo-romantici m and Realism\nlie in Berlioz's literary programmatic symphonies and the influence of Weber'\noperatic use ofreminiscence techniques, together with hi evocation ofnature\nand the supernatural. An important peel ofthe new materiali m and sensual-\nity which characteri the aesthetics ofexpr ion in mid-nine~nth-century\nmusic is an emphasi on the erotic. A key work in thi development is Wagner'\nTannJui'user(I 845), and as Edward Lippman points out, a pan.lle1 phil phial\nargument for this position can be found in S0ren Kierkegaard' EitJrerjOr\n(1843). Kierkegaard, in his discussion of'The Musial-Erotic' in Mozart' D(11f\nGiovanni, proposes that it i mu ic' very ab traetn thu enables it to express\nerotic sensuousn , to give it (:oncrete form and immediacy: 'The mOSt\nabstract idea conceivable i the sen uou in its elemental originality.

Kierkegurd is of interest in this context\nbecause he is a philosopher who has rejected systematic philosophising, and\naspires towards artistic praxis, but is nevertheless not an ani t. The existential-\nist abyss he f.accs represents an impasse at the mid-century which is bridged by\nart with, it can be argued, the assisunce of Schopenhauer's philosophy.\nAdorno, in his first published book Kierkegaard: Constnuti01l of the Aesthetit,\nwrit : '[Kierkegurd] gives testimony to the isolation ofan intellectual, living\non private income, hut in on himself; an isolation that, in this period oflate\nGerman Romantici m and late idc:aJism, was expressed in philosophy only by\nSchopenhauer'.' , This aspiration ofphilosophy towards an, with its accompa-\nnying rejection ofacademic systematising and tendency towards the aphoris~\nis also in part provoked by the encounter with mu ic and the ersion ofan is0-\nlated, If-reflective inwardn it was felt to embody.

The account by the Russian liberal exile\nAlexander Herzen, who witnessed the 'June days' of 1848 in Paris, when the\nsocialist working classes in the city rose in defiance of the bourgeois national\nlegislature, and were bloodily slaughtered, brings home the cataclysmic effect\nof the failure:\nNo living man can remain the same after such a blow. He either turns more\nreligious, clinging desperately to his creed and finding a kind ofconsolation in\ndespair, and, stTUck by the thunderbolt, his heart yet again sends forth new\nshoots. Or else, manfully, though relucrandy, he parts with hi.s last illusion ,\ntaking an even more sober view and loosening his grip on the last withered\nleaves being whirled away by the biting autumnaJ wind. Which is preferable? It\nis hard to say. One leads to the bliss offolly, the other to the misery of know1-\ncdge. u\nThese extremes are epitomised in the poetry ofBaudclaire in France and - to an\nextent- in the musicofWagner in Germany. The change is strikingly evident in\nthe jaundiced modernism ofBaudelaire's Flellrs dll mal (1857), with itS combi-\nnation ofdisillusion and utopian aspiration, the visionary search for the new\nand unknown, for inner distant shores to escape the dull passage of time and\nthe mundane experience ofthe everyday, to be sexn in a poem like 'Le voyage':\nAmer savoir, celui qu'on tire du voyage!\nLe monde monotone et petit, aujourd'hui,\nHier, demain, toujours, nous nit voir noue image:\nVne oasis d'horrcur dans un d~rt d'mnui!\n[What bitter wisdom does the voyage give!\nThe world, mall, dull, today and) terday,\nTomorrow, will our liken till revive:\nOasis grim in our Sahara grey!] '4\nThe ecstatic desperation of the fin..1stanza of the poem, with its imagery of\ndeath and deliverance, can hardly help but call to mind that other passioO<lte\nretreat into inwardness and extinction ofthe same yor - Wagner' Tristmt wuJ\nIsolde:\n13 Alcx2ndcr Hcru:n.

This had already begun with the distinctly non-\nPositivist, Hegelian Idealist A. B. Marx, who played a central role in the\nestablishment of music theory in the mid-century, but whose plans for the\nrationalisation and development ofmusic pedagogy in schools had the official\nsupport ofthe Prussian state. The consolidation ofmusicology as an indepen-\ndent discipline continues in the later part ofthe century through the efforts of\nFriedrich Chrysander and Philip Spitta, culminating in the sysccmatic musicol-\nogy of Guido Adler and in the new music theory associated with Hugo\nRiemann and his circle. The search for the origins ofmusic in primitive forms\nof communication and animal cries, together with the devdopment of the\npsychology ofmusic showed the immed iate in fluencc ofCharles Darwin's evo-\nlutionary theories - music's biological origins and its relation to language I , - as\nwell as the extension of Darwinism in the psychological and philosophical\nwritings ofHerbert Spencer.LoThis is manifest in a diverse range oftheorists at\nthis period, notably Edmund Gurney, probably the most significant English\nwriter on music in the nineteenth century, and Richard Wal1aschek, whose\ndebates with Spencer on the origins of music appeared in the journal Mind in\nthe 18905. L 1\nThe apparendy irresistible confidence and dominance ofthe natural sciences\nand their conviction that the world can be controlled and explained through\nthe power of rationality, together with the increasing industrialisation and\ncommercialisation of Western society, are the counterpole to what are, in\neffect, two different versions ofthe anistic leuat into inwardness and auton-\nomy. This contradiction is that between,on the one hand, a turning inwards of\nthe arts, and, on the other hand, their unavoidable participation in the busde of\nthe commercial free market in a rapidly indusuialising society. Thi tension is\nneady encapsulated by Hugo von Hofmannsthal, who wrote in 1894: \u00b7Today,\ntwo things seem to be modem: the analysis oflife and the flight from life ...\nOne practises anatomy on the inner life ofone's mind, or one dream .,n\nThere is at the same time a convergence of highly influential ideas which\nimpinge on the neo-romantic aesthetics ofexpression and draw it in tbe direc-\ntion of the extra-musical and associations with the turbulent political conteXt\n19 Stt for insttlltt bM1cs Darwin, 7h~ rftAt \u00a3Jutjqru bI Mo.

That these all have groat resonance in Wagner's writings and in his\nmusic is undeniable. But what is equally evident, as Dahlhaus has observed,13 is\nthe stylistic divtrgenu of the music of these years, and the absence ofa single\ndominant style. While it is clear that the conception ofan absolute music, free-\nstanding and autonomous, continues to act as centre of gravity for the mid-\ncentury, the resistance to tbe idea also belongs to its foree-field. Nationalism\nand Realism in music would appear at first sight to be pulling in the opposite\ndirection to that ofabsolute music, tOwards extra-musical referentiality at the\nvery leas~ and tOwards the functional context of music and the shaping of\nnational identities. Having said thi~ however, there is no doubt that the domi-\nnant paradigm remains that ofGennan insuumenal music, with Beethoven's\nsymphonies and overtures fad as 'programmatic', and German Romantic\nopera with its evocation of the mysterious and supernatural, but particularly\nWeber's opentic ovenures, as its exemplars. Vladimir Stasov, the highly\ninfluential nineteenth-century Russian music critic and protagonist of the\nRussian nationalist school, emphasises this fading in relation to Glina when\nhe writes:\nWhat arc most of 8\u00abt:hovm s overtures (ub1IDTa, CoTiDlmrllS, Etrmtmt, etc.),\ncertain pans ofhis last quartets, ma.ny ofhis sonaas, and all sa~ his tim two\nsymphonies if not 'prognmme music!...The ~rtures of We.~r,\nMendcl hn, and Berlioz are also programmatic. All of this music is &r, f.lr\nremoved from the 'absolutt mustC ofeartierda .1.4\nThe rejccti n ofthe idea ofabsolute music in this case merely serves to perpet-\nuate its technical mean , albeit ostensibly towards other ends. Furthermore it\nis also striking that French and Italian music, dominated as they were by grand\nopera and music for the thearn; also demonstrate a certain con ergence with\nGerman absolute music by the 18705 and 18805 with Saint-Saens's project to\nintroduce insuumenal musical forms and genres to France after the Fnnro-\nPrussian War (admittedly also for reasons to do with the bolstering of French\nnational If teem), and the evident influ n ofWagnerian music drama on\nthe late works of Verdi.

Indeed, he is probably, next to\nNietzsche, the most influential philosopher of the second halfof the century.\nFor Schopenhauer the power ofart is the joining ofthe sen uou particular and\nthe world of universal Ideas (and in this we see a return to the Platonic Ideal\nForms). It is through art that we are able w gain some respite and ealm from the\nrestless triving ofthe world ofsense and know the universal for an instant in a\nstate ofwill-less contemplation. It is mu ic which he sees as the most direct rep-\nresentation or expression of the Will, and simultaneously as the art form most\nimmediately capable of freeing us from the force of the Will. But more than\nthis, music constitutes for him a kind of philosophising without concepts, and\nfurthermore he claims, ifone were w succet..-d in conccptuali ing mu ic accu-\nrately, then one would have succeeded in conceptualising and explaining the\nworld, as music i its essence, its in-itself. Toward the end of his lengthy di -\ncuss ion ofmusic in The World as Will and Idea he umman hisugumentin the\nfollowing terms:\nIn the whole ofthi eJCposition of mu ic I have tx:en trying to bring out c10rly\nthat it expresses in a perfectly universal language. in a homogeneous material,\n(that i , in mere tones), and with the greatest di tinction and truth, the inner\nnature, the in-itselfof the world, which we think of under the concept ofwill.\nbecause WIll is its c10rest manif ration. Further, according to my view and\ncontention, philosophy i' nothing but a complete and accurate reproduction\nand eJCprcssion of the nature of the world in ery gen ral concepts, for onl in\nsuch i it po ible to gain a perspectl eon thu whole nature whi h will be ade-\nquate and appliahle everywhere.

Consequently Leibnitz' words ... m~y be paro-\ndied in the following way to suit our loftier iew ofmu ic: 'music is the uncon-\nsciou exercise in metaphysi in whi h the mind d not know that it i\nphilosophi ing'.1..<\n1S Arthur hOJX\"nbauer.71lL World IIJ Will.1Ui Idtll. ro. fbvtd 1\\cnNn., en 1IIIlkmun (london.\nI99S),PP. I 1-1.\nMusic as ideal: the aesthetics ofautonomy 33 1\nSchopenhauer brings the theory ofexpression to the point where it becomes, in\na sense,a version ofthe theory ofimitation or representation. Butwhat is being\nrepresented is not the outside world of nature, which Schopenhauer sees as\nSchein, mere illusion or appearance. Instead it is inner nature, the force of the\nWill itself, as a kind of life force, which, through the transfiguring power of\nmusic and the detached self-reflectivity which results, gives immediate access\nto the world of ideas behind the world of appeannce. This is a kind of pure\nknowledge, chancterised by aesthetic di interesrednes and deClched from the\nblind force of the Will, a form of 'cognition without concepts'. But, as\nDahlhaus suggests, 'thi esthetic \"rescue\" ofideas is precarious and threatened:\nthe realm ofesthetics is a realm ofappearance and even ideas sink to this realm\nifthey are entrusted entirely to esthetic contemplation'.u. This extreme version\nof the theory of expression as immediate manifestation of the inner world of\nfeelings lead, in fact, to the contemplation ofpure form. That is to say, it leads\nparadoxically back to formali m and the theory of form. Thus we arrive at a\npoint where the idea of pure expression, as put forward b Schopenhauer,\noc'COm what is sometimes mi takenly regarded as its opposite: formalism.\nBefore taking this po ition further, however, and eumining the formalist\ntheory put fOrw:lrd by Eduard Han lick, I should first like to consider some\naspects of hopenhauer philosophy in relation to Wagner and iettsehe.\nIn his writings from the yean 1849-51 we know that Wagner had not. et\nread hopenhauer: even so the late nineteenth-<:entury English tran lator of\nhis prose writings, William hton Ellis goes so f.lr as to ugg t that there is\nalready a remarkable affinity with the philosopher' thought even before he had\nread him. He notes that 'an anenti e peru I [of\"The rt- ork ofthe Future'\"\n(I 49)] cannot f.lil to bring h me (; those conversant with hopenhauer's Dit\n\\ elt als Wilu und VursUUIIlf,9 the remaruble fact that t\\ gnate minds have\ndl\"Veloped an almost identical stem fphil ph.

At this stage, now an enthusiastic Schopenhaueran, he remained uncon-\nvinced by Wagner's music. In 1868, however, having heard Tristmr, he was won\nover, and shortly after had the opportunity to meet the composer. By 1869,\nwhen he took up his professorship at Basic University, he had become a close\nmember of me Wagner circle and a frequent visitor to the family home at\nTribschen. It is this intoxicating combination of the experience of Wagner's\nmusic, the reading ofthe composer's theoretical works, and the mutual enthu-\nsiasm for Schopenhauer that led directly to Nietzsche's first important philo-\nsophical book, The Birth ofTragetiy out oftJrt Spirit ofMusi&. In it he attempted to\ndemonstrate the origins oftragedy (which, like Wagner, he ties to music) in the\nDionysian riteS ofme ancient Greek world, and at the same time to deri~from\nthis a general theory ofanistic creation. He oudines this position at the start of\nthe book - a passage I cite at length to give the 6avourofNiettsche's rheroricat\nthis stage, and his at times extreme use ofsomewhat misleading metaphors:\nWe shall have gained much for the science ofaesthetics when we have come to\nrealize, noc just through logical insight but also with the certaintyof mething\ndirectly appre:hended [.AJtu)UllllUfBl, that the continuous ~Iution of art is\nbound up with the duality of the Apolline and the DionysiiU in much the same\nway as re:product1on depends on there: being twO saes which co-exist in a tate\nofperpetual conflict interrupted only occasionally by periods ofrc:conciliation.\nWe have borrowed these names from the Greeks who re:veaJ the profound my -\nteries oftheir view ofart to those with in ight, n t in conceptS, admittedly, but\nthrough the penetratingly vivid figures of their god .

It was widely reguded as lacking any\nfirm scientific or scholarly foundations (the work was regarded as a philological\nrather than philosophical study, given Nietzsche's post as ProfessorofClassical\nPhilology at Basle) and was seen as amounting to little more than a propaganda\ntract in supportofWagner.19 Nietzsche later repudiated the book,and by 1878\nhad rejected both Wagner and Schopenhauer. I shall return to a consideration\nof Nietzsche's position regarding the relation between form and expression\nafter an aamination ofHanslick's concept ofform.\nThe aesthetics ofform: Hanslick and Nietzsche\nWelllmown for his criticism of Wagner and support of Brahms, Hanslick pub-\nlished the first edition of his influential book Yom Musik4Jisllr-ScIrDnct (On the\nBtilUtifiU i1l Musil) in 185~ and it was a work which was to go through many\nfurther editions over the next halfcentury, reaching its eighth edition in 1891. In\nit, through a critique ofthe e.xpressivist position in music., he put forward what is\noften regarded as a purely formalist aesthetic, a position which argues that music\nis totally autonomous and sdf-referential, that is, t'ree-sClnding, not contingent\nor dependent upon anything outside itselffor its moning and, imponandy, that\nmusic i incapable ofexp ing definite emotions. It is worth considering bis\nposition in some detaiJ here, as it represents the autonomist position in music at\nits most extreme and offers wmt still remains one ofthe c1arest and most coher-\nent arguments for it. I shall take key stag ofbis argument one at a time.\nHan Ii step by stcp refutes the exp . ion theory ofmusic. The tirst SClge\ni through negation. He SClrts from the position that all musicians assume that\nmu ic represents definite feclin but whenp~, they have to admit they\ncannot say what fc:dings precisely are being pressed. So they fal1 back on the\nposition that music can only represent indefinite feelings.\nAlth gb .\u2022. all m ic thco\u00b7 txitfya pt and b25C: their arguments on the\npostulate that music h the powa (rq>resentin d finite onotions., yet their\n~r judgment bas kept them from openl avowin it.

I }\n334 MAX PAOOISON\nBut, he argues, this can only mean that music traces the dynamic motion ofa\nfeeling, and this is not the same as expressing an indefinite emotion, for to rep-\nresent an indefinite emotion is a contradiction in terms. The question is what is\nbeing represented? and this cannot be answered.\nRationally understood, this can only mean that music ought to deal with the\nmotion accompanying a feeling, regardless ofits essential part, with what is felt;\nin other words, that its function is restricted to the reproduction ofwhat we\ntermed the dynamic element of an emotion, a function which we unhesitat-\ningly conceded to music. But this property does not enable music to represent\nindefinite feelings, for to 'represent' something 'indefinite' is a conmdiction in\nterms. Psychical motion, con idered as motion apan from the state ofmind it\ninvolves, can never become the obj et ofan an, because without an answer to\nthe query, What is moving, or what is being moved? an an has nothing tangible\nto work upon. That which is implied in the proposition - namely, that music is\nnot intended to represent a definite feeling (which is undoubtedly true) - i\nonly a negative aspect ofthe question. (P.37)\nHanslick recognises that thus far his argument has had to focus on the negative\ntask ofdemonst.rating that, in spite ofthe long-sanding conviction to the con-\ntrary, music does not represent feelings at aJl, whether definite or indefinite.\nHis argument hinges on the point that artWorks are concerned with individu-\nalising the particular out ofthe general- theconcretising ofits individual form\nout ofthe generalised sute of the musical material. To represent an indefinite\nfeeling would therefore be to attempt to move in the opposite direction, from\nthe particular to the general, leaving the question as to what form the general\ncould possibly take under such circumsunces. He puts hi argument with great\nclarity in the following term :\nBut what is the positive, the creative., fiaetor in a musical compositi n? An\nindefinite feeJjng as such cannot supply a ubject; to utilise it an an would, first\nofaU, have to solve the problem: whatfonn can be given to it? The: functi n of\nan consiSts in individMillisiJtg, in evolving the: definite out of the iodefioja; the:\nparticular out of the general. The: theory rapecting indefinite feelings' would\nreverse this process. It lands us in even greater difficulti dun the theory that\nmusic represents something though it is impossible to define what. This posi-\ntion is but a step removed from the clttr recognition that music represen no\nfeelings, either definite or indefinite. Yet where is the mu idan who would\ndeprive his anofthat domain which from time immemorial h been claimed\nbelonging to it? (PP.37-8)\nViewed positively, however, the one ~rtlintywe an: left with i that music in\nthe final analy is isform. The first problem ofmu ie, thcrefon:, i to givcjurm to\nsuch dynamic motion. Thus he concludes that mu ic expresses neither definit(\nnor indefinite emotions. The second sage, in chapter III of hi boo i to\nMusic as ideal: the usthetics ofautOnomy 335\npresent the positive aspect of music's lack ofexpression. So, what then is the\nbeautiful in music according to Hanslick.? He writes:\nIts 1IJlture is spectfi&illly mJLSiazI. By this we mean that the beautiful is not contin-\ngent upon nor in need ofany subject introduced from without, but that it con-\nsists wholly of sounds artistically combined. The ingenious co-ordinarion of\nintrinsically pleasing sounds, their consonance and contrast, their Bight and\nreapproach, their increasing and diminishing strength - this it is which, in frtt\nand unimpeded forms, presents itsclfto our mental vision.\n(p. 47, italics in originaJ)\nThus, for Hanslin, music is a play ofsounds, a kind ofsonic equivalent of the\nuleidosco~,asforms, symmetries, strUet11res (although the metaphor of the\nkaleidosco~is in many respectS an unfortunate and misleading one, as it intro-\nduces an unintended clement ofarbitrariness into Hanslick's argument). The\ncomposersha~ the material ofmusic - sounds as rhythm, melody, harmony,\ntimbre. And Hanslick goes on:\nTo the question: What is to be expressed with all thi material? The answcrwill\nbe: Musical ideas. Now, a musical idea n:produced in its entirety is not only an\nobject ofintrinsic beauty but also an end in itsclf, and not a means ofn:prcscnt-\ning feelings and thoughts. The essence ofmusic is sound and motion. (P.48)\nSo there we have it t1I II1IU: music is not the expression of feelings at all, but\ninstead i the haping of the musical iJUa - in purely musilJzJ tern1S as form.\nIndeed, Hanslick hows himself to be in a direct line of descent from the\nIdealist philosophers of the early yars ofebe nineteenth century and appears\nin particular to be referring back to Hegcl, who h d argued that art is the\nhapingofthe'ldea' in ~uousmaterial. But for Hanslick music is notcmpty\nform. It is nuterial animated by a mind working within it - the term he uses\nhere' the German word Geist, a term hieb d not translate properly into\nEngli h, but which can mean vario Iy'mind\" pirit' or intdlecr' and which\nwas central to Hegd's dialectical phil phy.

But having dismissed expression in music,\nor at least, having argued that what music expresses is not particular emotions\nbut rather the Idea, Hanslick still avoids confronting the problem of'mcaning'\nin music. As John Daverio has put it:\nthere is at least one fuct that Eduard Hanslick's protofonnalist aesthetic makes\nabundantly clear: it is fur easier to prove a negative thesis than to forward a pos-\nitive account ofhow music,gi~ its discontinuous relationship with objective\nreality, interacts with meaning. To do so requires a kind ofleap over an abyss, a\nforay, nolens volens, into the murky territory ofmusical mmphysics.u\nBut Hanslick,anticipating the new Positivi m ofthe second halfofthe century\n(he is referred to approvingly by Helmholtz) and the rise ofthe more soba' and\nsystematic ethos ofMusikwissotsdrajt, was perhaps underst:andably reJucu.nt to\nindulge in excessive metaphysical speculation. At the same time, howc=ver, he\nhints - although he does not draw the necessary conclu ions from his theory -\nthat the composer, unlike the architect, in dealing with the materiaJ also has to\nreckon with the effects of past usage. Thus he suggests, without really biting\nthis up, that the material it:seJfis not purely natural, raw material, but is histor-\nical, the product ofprevious interactions betweencom~rsand material. The\nimplications of this are also tir-reaching, CVOl though not pursued until the\ntwentieth century (for example, in the music aesthetics ofT. W. Adorno). Ifthe\nmaterial i imbued with Geist, and possesses 'intellectuality and pathos to a\nhigh degree', it is presumably meaningful in the very concrete sense of the\nmusical gestures and genres which form the material itself. Han lick does not\nprobe deeper, howc=ver, leaving hi discussion at a disappointingly abstract\nlevel.\nIt is interesting at this junctUre to return to Nietzsche, because in the next\nsbge ofhis development after TIre Birt1l ofT'rt1lJedy he addresses the very point\nwhere Hanslick lcav off, although without referring to Hanslick acst:beti .\nThi coincides with ietz.sehe's rejection ofboth Wagner and Sch penh2uer\nafter 1878, and thus it also sees a change in hi tylc of phil phising and a\nhift in his position in relation to mu ic. The new aesthetic is clearly formu-\nlated in Human, All Too Human (1878), the book which provoked the rift with\nWagner, in that section entided 'From the Soul ofAni and Writers', What\nietzsche argues here i the recognition of the historical p through\nwhich mu ical figuration, conventions g tures acquire their apparentJ\nimmanent musicaJ meanings - that' ,largely through former, but now n ro-\nralised, associations with drama, poetry, dance and ph iol ture. In\nAphori m 216 he writes:\nMusic as ideal: the: aesthetics ofautonomy 337\nIt seems tbat in earlier times, something must often hav~ occurred much like\nwhat is now going on befo~ our \u00ab:yes and cars in th~ d~dopmmt of music;\nna~ly ofdramatic music: while music wlthout explanatory danc~ and miming\n(1anguag~ ofgestu~) is at 6rst ~mpty noise, long habituation to that juxtaposi-\ntion of music and gcstu~ teacbes~ ear an immediate und~rstanding of th~\ntonal6gures. Finally, th~ car ~bes a level ofrapid und~rstanding sucb that it\nno longer requires visibl~ m~m~nt, and JUlderstallds th~ composer wlthout it.\nThm~ a~ talking about absolute music., that is, music in which ~rything\ncan be understood symbolically, wlthout funher aids.Jl\nOfcourse, this clearly owes much to Wagner's theory ofthe leitmotif, butatthe\nsam~ time it seeks to demystify the process and generalise it rowards an account\nofthe way in which autonomous music really has its origins in association and\n~prcscntation,th~ tt'3ces ofwhich it carries with it in quiu= concrete terms. In\nthe previous aphori m in HU11Ul1I, All Too HU11Ul1I, NietzSche hints at the manner\nin which the essentially empty, non-conceptual formalism of absoluu= music\nhas come to acquire a type ofconceptuality by association:\n'Absolut~music' is ~ith~r pu~ form, in the raw state ofmusic.,whe~ sounds in\nrhythm and at various volumes a~ enough to gi~ joy; or else it is th~ symbol-\ni m offorms that, without poetry, an speak to our understanding (since, after\nth~ twO arts had undergone a long d~1 pmmt togcther, musical form was\nfinally~n through and through wlth threads ofCOlKXpts and feelings). J\nThese aphorisms point in the direction ofsymbolism by suggesting that the\nmaterial ofmusic is itseJfpenneated by figures and gestures which are redolent\nwith meaning, but which are sublimated through the form of the work. This\ng1 a sophisticated twist to the aesthetics ofexpression through bringing it\ninto conjunction with a concept of form. The apparent meaninglessness of\nautonom us music i thus seen to be a sublimation of meaning in a very\nmaterial sense. This is hinted at in Hanslic~ but is only fonnu12ted clearly,\nalbeit briefly and without daboration, by NietzsChe. And just as such reflec-\ntions begin to nudge music OUt of its isolated state ofautonomy, so literawre\nand poetics at this period move~ more decisively in the direction ofmusic's\nidealised tate ofabstraction.\nSymbolism, \/'arl \/JOUT Part, and the triumph ofthe\naesthetics ofautonomy\nIn the chapter devoted pcci6cally to musi inA Rib m Huysmans rcvals the\ndis te his hero d Esscinres feels ~ r the rude di tractions ofthe concert hall\n31 Frkdndl NlC'Itud~,\n(Hal1llOlldJwon:h.

It is as if, in the retreat from society, and thus inevitably from music as a\npublic art, music itsdfsutfuses all else in the seclusion ofthe inner world. The\nlogic of music and its 'meaningful meaninglessness' now pervades all the arts\nand acts as a modd for the cultivation ofthe senses characr.erised by the strict-\nest autonomy and separation from usefulness, functionalism and utility,\nHuysmans's hermetic exploration ofthe limits ofart and ofaesthetic experi-\nence in A RebOllTS raises a number ofdefinitive issues which can serve as refer-\nence points for discussion of the contradictions inherent in the concept of\nautonomy and the ideal of music. ot least it rc:va1s the extent to which this\nperiod looks both ways: it anticipates the rise of modernism and the avant-\ngarde while extending to their extreme the ideas of autonomy, expression,\nform and fragmentation which were so central to early Romantici m. Pivotal is\nthe connection between the autonomy aesthetic which characterised the\nFrench Symbolists and the corresponding musical Impre:ssioni m ofthejin de\nsitl\/\u00a3 and the German Idealism and Romanticism of the early part of the\ncentury (des Esseintes mentions in passing at the end of the no~l,when hi\nself-imposed isolation has been breached and his enclosed world is collapsing\nunder the pressure both ofthe outside world and ofhis medical condition, the\nconsolation he derives from reading Schopenhauer), There is the uneasy fasci-\nnation with religion and religiosity which characr.eri both pans of the\ncentury. For des Esseintes, as we ha~ secn, it is Catholic mysticism and monas-\nticism, combined with a fascination with mediaevalism which has its origins in\npart in Wagner, but which is also to be seen much in evidence in the Debu of\nthe 18805 and 18905. For the IdealiSts it is the rcsidu ofPietism and a liking\nfor metaphysics, with the tendency for art to elevate itsdfto the Statu ofan art-\nreligion, These are associated with a number of oth r developments from\nwhich I here identify five, First,and most importantly, there is the reueat from\neveryday life and the mundane into the inna world of aesthetic ubjcctiviry\nand its corresponding objectification as th autonomous, hermeticaJly scaled\nartWork, This is a form ofsolipsism impossible to defend phil phically but\neasy to understand historically in view of the d' illusion ofart and its retJOt\nfrom engagement after 1848. By the late ninetttnth century this i epitomised\nin Paul Valery's view ofart as 'a dosed world', Jar 1Il07fdefermi, and hi wish to\ntranscend what be called 'the monotonous disorder ofcxtUior life', 41t can be\nunderstood as an extreme version of the early German Idealis concept of\n'inwardness', Secondly there is the withdr.tWaJ from utility from mcans-cnds\nlop\u00b7 71\u00b7\nMusic as ideal: the aesthetics ofautonomy 339\nrationality, and the devation of uselessness to the ultimate aesthetic value. In\nOscar Wilde's famous epithets from the preface to The Portrait ofDoriiIn Gray\n(1891)we find: 'From the point ofvkw ofform, the type ofall the artS is the art\nof the musician ... All art is quite useless.')S This, in dfect, can be understood\nas a return to Kant's argument in The Critique ofJuJement that an is characteT-\nised by 'purposiveness without a purpose': art has the form of purposiveness,\nbut does not have a purpose outside itself. Valery, who was first associated with\nMallarme and Verlaine in the 18905, and whose M01lSieur Teste (1896) was the\nmodel for Debussy'S music criticism in his MonsitJCrCrocht (1901), laterwror.e:\nThe most evident characteristic ofa work ofart may be termed uselessness ...\nIn the life ofevery individual we can ... circumscribe a peculiar re:alm consti-\ntuted by the sum ofbis 'useless sensations' and 'arbitra.ry acts'. Art originated in\nthe atttmpt to endow these sensations wlth a kind ofutility and these acts wlth\na kind ofuamty.J6\nAnd in M01lSieJCr Teste we find the original thought for this - the idea that music\ni the art above all others which gives coherence to the otherwise fleeting and\nephemeral, and gives meaning to the otherwise meaningless through providing\nit with a structUral confal - that ofies autonomous form - thus rendering it\nconscious and aware ofitself:\nMu ic alone can do iL Asort offield cootrOlJing these phenomena ofconscious-\nn - imag ,ideas, which wlthout that fidd would be imply Cqmbi1uztimu. a\nsymmetrical group ofall dK combinations.J\nDcbussy'sown acsthetic,a1though seldom articulated at any length orwith any\nseriou n , clearly reflects that of the Symbolists in this respect. The idea of\nthe illusory charaettr ofa~ and of the hermetically sated inner necessity of\nmusic whjch resists the incursions of the outside world to construa its own\ncontext, is plainly evident in a statement he published in Musiu in October\n1902 :\nAn' the most beautiful dec:rption ofall! And although people try to incorpo-\nrate the everyda events oflife in i\"t, we must hope that it wlll rt'rnain a dec:rp-\ntion lest it become a utilitarian thing sad as a f~ry.J\nThirdly, there is the problem of meaning already alluded to. WMt i saiking\nabout the work of the Symbolist potts and writers, including maine\nRimbaud MaI~ al6'y,Mact:crlin and Huysm~i thce:xttnttowhich\nMAX PADDISON\ntheir highly self-aware art sought to distance itselffrom the everyday meanings\noflanguage and to draw on the allusi~nessand indirecmess ofmusic, a signifi-\ncant aspect ofwhich concerns the sensuous immediacy ofwords as sound. This\nlods on directly to the fourth point: the rational control ofsensuous m~teriaJ,\nas matiere, the espousal offormalism, and the rational exploration of the irra-\ntional, are central to this - this is Valery's dialectical oscillation between inspi-\nration and technique, and Mallanne's exploration ofthe boundaries ofcontrol\nand chance in his later writings. In weakening the referentiality oflangoage the\nSymbolists sought to discover an intem~J ratiomJe for the structuring of the\nartwork: what Valery means by 'utility' and 'necessity' implies a purely im~\u00ad\nnent logic of poetic syntax which at the same time stimulates an endlessly\nsubtle web of allusiveness. At its most experimental extreme, the Symbolist\npoem comes to parallel in cemin respectS a musical score, and thus calls for per-\nformance. In the prose 'Preface' to the remarkable late poem 'Un roup de des'\n('The throw ofthe dice') (1897) Mallarme writes:\nnamove is avoided. Add thar fTom this strippcd-down mode ofthought, with\nits retreats, prolongations, flights, or fTom its very design, there results, for\nwhoever would read it aloud, a mu icaJ score.~ difference in th type faces,\nberween the dominant motif, a secondary, and adja~'C:nt OIK, dictates their\nimportance for oral exp ion, and the range or disposition of the characters,\nin the middle, at the top, or at the bonom of the page, marks the rio ing and\nfalling of the intorution ... [Free versc= and the prose poem) are joined under a\ntrange influence, that of Music, as it is beard at a concert; sevttal of i\nmethods, which scxmed to me to apply to Literawre are to be Ii und here. 't\nAnd finally, there is the idea of the indivisible fusion of form, content and\nmateri~1 represented by music. Indeed, to rttum to the starting-point ofth\u00b7\nchapter: Walter Pater had argued that 'all art aspires to the condition ofmusic'\nprecisely because of the general tendency ofall art to try to obliterate the dis-\ntinction between form, content and ubjcet-~tter,and increasingly to reoeat\nfrom representation into abstraction. In 'The School ofGiorgionc' he writeS at\nlength on this aspiration, and even proposes it as an acstheti criterion of\nuccess in all thc arts:\nIt is the art of music which most completely realises this anim idc:aJ, chi\nperfect identification of~tterand form. In itsconsum~temamen , the end\nis not di tinct fTom the mans, the: fonn from the maarr. the ubjcet from the\n~xp ion; they inhere in and comple:ttly turate c:ach other; and to it, tbCfC'-\nfore, to the conditi n ofi peTfc:et momcn all the arts ~y be upposcd con-\nsundy to tend and pire.

Therefore, although each art has its\nincommunicable element, its untranslatable order of impressions, its unique\nmode of reaching the 'imagilUtivc reason', yet the arts may be represented as\ncontinually struggling after the law or principle ofmusic, to a condition which\nmusic alone completrly real ises; and one ofthe chieffunctions ofaesthetic crit-\nicism, dealing with the products ofan, new or old, is ro estimate the degree: in\nwhich each ofthose products approaches, in this sense, to musical law.40\nMusic had arrived at last as the frrimil inter pares, not onJy accepted as equal in\nsignificance to poetry or painting, and indeed to philosophy, but regarded as\nthe model ofperfection for all the ans.
