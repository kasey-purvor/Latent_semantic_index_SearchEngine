Introduction 41 \n 42 \n1.1 Preamble 43 \nAs a result of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gasses it has been predicted that by the end of 44 \nthe 21st Century average global surface temperatures will have increased by up 1.8 to 4\u00b0C (Meehl et 45 \n3 \n \nal., 2007). These predictions are generated by Global General Circulation Models (GCM) simulating 46 \nthe present day with projected increases of greenhouse gases from anthropogenic sources. To 47 \nassess how well GCMs perform under significantly different climates than the present day, it has 48 \nbecome common to use the geological record as a laboratory (Valdes, 2000; Micheels et al., 2007; 49 \nSalzmann et al., 2009). Earth history presents many intervals that were significantly warmer than 50 \npresent, to be able to successfully simulate these with GCMs it is important to have a reasonable 51 \ngrasp of the boundary conditions, for each interval. One important boundary condition is the 52 \nvegetation. Vegetation affects the global climate in many a number of ways such asincluding; 53 \naltering the surface albedo (Bonan et al., 1992; de Noblet et al., 1996; Hoffmann and Jackson, 2000) 54 \nand changes in evapotranspiration from the conversion of forests into grasslands leading to reduced 55 \nregional precipitation (Shukla et al., 1990). It Vegetation is also strongly affected by the ambient 56 \nclimate, which principally influences its distribution. This makes vegetation, not only an important 57 \nboundary condition, but a method to assess GCM predictions where direct measurements are not 58 \npossible. Palaeobotanical remains such as pollen, wood and leaves are a widely utilised proxy for 59 \nreconstructing past continental climates, and are used in the assessment of the predictive abilities of 60 \nGlobal Circulation Models (GCMs) (Kohfield and Harrison, 2000; Valdes, 2000; Kageyama et al., 61 \n2001). 62 \nWe present herein a new vegetation reconstruction for the Tortonian Stage Age suitable for use in 63 \nboth assessing GCM simulations and as a boundary condition for experiments. This reconstruction 64 \nuses a novel combination of merging palaeobotanical data and outputs from a state-of-the-art GCM-65 \nvegetation model experiment, to produce an advanced global biome distribution map of Tortonian 66 \nvegetation. The reconstructed distribution provides insights into Tortonian climate, which will help 67 \ninform future modelling studies. Previous global maps of Tortonian vegetation have been generated 68 \nusing unpublished data sets (Fran\u00e7ois et al., 2006) or vegetation reconstructed from a small (<50) 69 \nnumber of palaeobotanical sites (Micheels, 2003; Micheels et al., 2007). These reconstructions have 70 \nalso been based on a modern geography, instead of the appropriate Tortonian palaeogeography, 71 \n4 \n \nand have classified Tortonian vegetation into a small (maximum 14) number of biome types. The 72 \nreconstruction presented here builds and improves on these by presenting a 240-site 73 \npalaeoecological dataset, combined with a state of the art GCM driven vegetation model 74 \nexperiment, to form a global vegetation reconstruction based on a 27 biome classification scheme. 75 \n1.2. An overview of the Tortonian 76 \nThe Tortonian Stage of the Late Miocene (11.61-7.25 Ma) is a periodan interval generally considered 77 \nto have been warmer than today (Wolfe, 1994a; Bruch et al., 2006; Micheels et al., 2007) with 78 \nmodest changes in continental position and orography. These changes include the presence of a 79 \nCentral American seaway, a marine encroachment from the south into Argentina, a large extension 80 \nof Eurasia into the Arctic Sea to approximately 80\u00b0N, the large Pannonian Lake in central Europe and 81 \na wider Indonesian seaway (Markwick, 2007). By 10 Ma ago aspects of ocean circulation were 82 \nbecoming comparable to the modern (Woodruff and Savin, 1989; Lohmann et al., 2006), though 83 \nMiocene circulation was affected by the open Central American seaway which allowed an eastwards 84 \nflow of Pacific waters into the Atlantic Ocean, preventing deep water formation in the North Atlantic 85 \n(Maier-Reimer et al., 1990; Lohmann et al., 2006; Lunt et al., 2008). The Miocene also represented a 86 \ncrucial period of uplift and the generation of arid regions (Harrison and Yin, 2004; Kohn and Fremd, 87 \n2008). The uplift of the Himalayas from a relatively low Tibetan Plateau (1-3 km) in the Late 88 \nOligocene to an average height of 4-5 km in the Late Miocene (~9 Ma) had effects on global 89 \natmospheric circulation, weathering rates and the Asian Monsoon (Quade et al., 1989; Guo et al., 90 \n2002; Spicer et al., 2003; Harrison and Yin, 2004; Sun et al., 2009). The Andes may have been at half 91 \ntheir modern height by 10.7 Ma (~1800 m) and have since been uplifting at 0.2-0.3 mm per year 92 \n(Gregory-Wodzicki, 2000). The Rocky Mountains of western North America are a product of several 93 \norogenic events, the most recent of which was the Laramide Orogeny which is dated to the Late 94 \nCretaceous to Palaeocene (English and Johnston, 2004). Subsequent to this major event the 95 \nColorado Plateau has been uplifted by nearly 2 km since the Cretaceous (Spencer, 1996). Estimates 96 \n5 \n \non the exact timing of the uplift and the rate are still unresolved but recent work focusing on the 97 \nColorado Plateau suggests a change in the dynamic topography of 400-1100 m has occurred in the 98 \nlast 30 Ma (Flowers et al., 2008; Moucha et al., 2009). The Alps in the Early to Middle Miocene were 99 \nmerely islands between the Paratethys and Western Tethys Seas being at an estimated height of 100 \n<1800 m, then major uplift occurred after 14 Ma until present (Jim\u00e9nez-Moreno et al., 2008). 101 \nAtmospheric Carbon dioxide levels for the Tortonian have been estimated, using boron isotopes 102 \n(Pearson and Palmer, 2000), alkenones (Pagani et al., 2005), stomatal indices (K\u00fcrschner et al., 1996; 103 \n2008), pedogenic carbonate (Ekart et al., 1999) and the GEOCARB mass balance model (Berner and 104 \nKothavala, 2001). All of these techniques estimate Tortonian CO2 to range between Last Glacial 105 \nMaximum, pre-industrial (Pearson and Palmer, 2000; Pagani et al., 2005) and mid-20th Century levels 106 \n(K\u00fcrschner et al., 1996; Ekart et al., 1999 Berner and Kothavala, 2001; K\u00fcrschner et al., 2008), 107 \nalthough pedogenic carbonates used to estimate CO2 go as high as 1170 ppmv at 10 Ma (Ekart et al., 108 \n1999). It is possible that Miocene climate change was not related to atmospheric CO2 variations 109 \n(Shevenell et al., 2004; Pagani et al., 2005; Mosbrugger et al., 2005), though new CO2 estimates, 110 \nsuch as those derived from stomatal indices, are more consistent with the co-evolution of Miocene 111 \nclimate and CO2 (K\u00fcrschner et al., 2008). 112 \n 113 \n2. Methods 114 \n 115 \n2.1. Constructing the vegetation database 116 \nUsing TEVIS (Tertiary Environments Vegetation Information System) (Salzmann et al., 2008), which is 117 \na Microsoft Access and ArcGIS 9 based database, 223 Tortonian vegetation sites (Fig. 1) have been 118 \ncollected and recorded in an internally consistent manner. Using the author\u2019s interpretation of 119 \npalaeobotanical sites, taken from the published literature, the recorded Tortonian sites have been 120 \n6 \n \ntranslated into the classification scheme of the BIOME4 mechanistic model of vegetation (Kaplan, 121 \n2001). TEVIS not only records the vegetation of the palaeobotanical site but also the latitude and 122 \nlongitude, sedimentology, method used to date the sample and a quality indicator \u2013 to ascertain the 123 \nresolution of the chronology. Where available, numerical climatic parameters such as mean annual 124 \ntemperature and precipitation are also recorded in TEVIS. This facilitates quantitative data-model 125 \ncomparison. Extracting climatic parameters from fossil assemblages can be achieved by a number of 126 \ntechniques and the majority of the estimates in the TEVIS database come from either the co-127 \nexistence approach (Mosbrugger and Utescher, 1997 and the NECLIME working group) or Climate 128 \nLeaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP) (Wolfe, 1979; 1993; Spicer, 2007; Spicer et al., 2009). 129 \nThe co-existence approach uses the climatic tolerances of a fossil plant\u2019s nearest living relative as a 130 \nguide to the climate tolerances of the fossil taxa. When this is done for a whole assemblage a 131 \nclimatic envelope is generated where all the fossil plants could have co-existed; providing an 132 \nestimate of climatic parameters (Mosbrugger and Utescher, 1997). CLAMP uses 31 leaf 133 \nphysiognomic (structure) characteristics, that have been shown to be related to the environment to 134 \nwhich the leaf architecture is exposed (Spicer, 2007; Spicer et al., 2009), to estimate the climatic 135 \nparameters of fossil leaf assemblages (Wolfe, 1993).  136 \nIt has been possible to confidently assign all literature-based vegetation reconstructions to a 137 \ncorresponding BIOME4 classification (Fig. 2). However, it should be noted that although the BIOME4 138 \nclassification represents biomes of the modern world these are not identical, in species composition, 139 \nto those of the Tortonian and in some regions the Tortonian biome has no modern analogue. 140 \n2.2. Construction of the animal database 141 \nTo provide additional information on Tortonian vegetation where palaeobotanical information is 142 \nabsent we have constructed, using the same Microsoft Access and ArcGIS platform successfully 143 \nemployed for TEVIS, a new database termed MAD (Miocene Animal Database). This database 144 \nrecords palaeo-rotated vertebrate fossil sites and the author\u2019s inferred habitat as well as taxonomic 145 \n7 \n \ndata. The author\u2019s inferred habitat is also converted, where possible, into a BIOME4 scheme 146 \nvegetation type. However there are limitations in using vertebrate assemblages to infer vegetation, 147 \nsuch as the respective scale of the inferred habitat and the reconstructed biome,  and this will 148 \nrequire further investigation. MAD also records information about the sedimentary facies, age and 149 \ndating method, specimen completeness and any taphonomic information provided. The sites 150 \ncollected in MAD are critical to increase our vegetation data coverage in regions where plant fossils 151 \nare not preserved. MAD contains 70 vertebrate locations and has provided 17 additional biome data 152 \npoints and provided valuable coverage in regions such as the Middle East and Central America (Fig. 153 \n3). 154 \n2.3. Description of the HadAM3 GCM and BIOME4 models 155 \nA suite of Late Miocene atmosphere-only General Circulation Model (AGCM) runs have been carried 156 \nout using the Hadley Centre Atmospheric Model Version 3 (HadAM3; Pope et al., 2000) and the 157 \nclimatologies used to run the mechanistic vegetation model BIOME4 (Kaplan 2001). A brief outline of 158 \nthe model and boundary conditions used in the simulations can be found below. A fuller description 159 \nof the modelling methodology can be found in Lunt et al. (2008). 160 \nHadAM3 has a horizontal resolution of 2.5\u00b0 latitude \u00d7 3.75\u00b0 longitude, this equates to a spatial 161 \nresolution of 278 \u00d7 417 km at the equator. The model has 19 vertical layers, a time step of 30 162 \nminutes and includes the Edwards and Slingo (1996) radiation scheme, the Gregory et al. (1997) 163 \nconvection scheme, a sea ice model that is largely the same as in HadAM2 (Cattle and Crossley, 164 \n1995) and MOSES (Cox et al., 1999) a land surface scheme capable of simulating freezing and melting 165 \nof soil moisture (Pope et al., 2000). HadAM3 has been successfully applied to numerous 166 \npalaeoclimate intervals of the pre-Quaternary (e.g. Haywood and Valdes, 2006; Lunt et al., 2008).  167 \nThe Late Miocene palaeogeography, orography and ice sheet extent were derived from Markwick 168 \n(2007). Crucially this gives a significant decrease in altitude of the Tibetan Plateau relative to the 169 \n8 \n \npresent day, as well as the western cordillera of North and South America. The land surface scheme 170 \nwas set to globally homogeneous values (in this case shrubland). Shrubland was chosen to initialise 171 \nthe model as its physical characteristics are least biasing in terms of climate prediction. Atmospheric 172 \nCO2 levels were set at 395 ppmv which is at the higher end of available estimates yet it should be 173 \nnoted that given prescribed sea surface temperatures in this model the exact CO2 value chosen does 174 \nnot have a large effect on the climate predicted by the model. 175 \nIn the absence of sufficient proxy sea surface temperatures (SSTs), we derive our Late Miocene SST 176 \ndistribution from a pre-industrial surface temperature distribution, T*pre-industrial, in the following way: 177 \n \n 178 \nWhere m is the number of the month (January=1), \u03a6 is the latitude, and A, B, and C are defined in 179 \nLunt et al. (2008; Table 1). T*pre-industrial  is derived from the means from years 1870\u20131900 of the 180 \nHadley Centre sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice climatologies (HadISST, Rayner et al., 2003). 181 \nThis formulation allows the sensitivity of the global warming, the amount of polar warmth, the 182 \nseasonality of the polar warmth, and the form of the latitudinal gradient of warming, to be tested 183 \nusing just 4 key parameters; A, B, C, and f(\u03a6).We address the inherent uncertainty associated with 184 \nthe prescribed boundary conditions by carrying out a suite of seven Late Miocene simulations, with 185 \ndifferent values of A, B, C and f (Lunt et al., 2008, table 1). The resulting distributions, from this 186 \ncalculation, are illustrated in and summarised in Lunt et al. (2008; Fig.2, table 2). The prescribed SSTs 187 \nall have a lower equator to pole temperature gradient than the pre-industrial, in agreement with 188 \nproxy data (e.g. Williams et al., 2005; Pearson et al., 2007), with a maximum change in Northern 189 \nHemisphere winter. This is also consistent with the idea that the current strength of the 190 \nthermohaline circulation developed through the Miocene (e.g. Jakobsson et al., 2007). These seven 191 \ndistributions are identical to those contemplated by Gladstone et al. (2007) in relation to the 192 \n9 \n \nhydrological budget in the Mediterranean of the Late Miocene. For all simulations, where the value 193 \nof SSTLateMiocene is below the freezing point of ocean water, Tfreeze, sea ice is allowed to form. In these 194 \ninstances, the SST is set to Tfreeze, and the surface temperature is no longer prescribed but is 195 \ncomputed by the sea ice component of HadAM3. Certain coastal SSTs had to be extrapolated due to 196 \nthe difference between the modern and Late Miocene land\u2013sea masks, but this is a minor effect. 197 \nBIOME4 (Kaplan, 2001) is a mechanistic equilibrium vegetation model which predicts global biome 198 \ndistribution from monthly averages of temperature, precipitation, cloudiness and absolute minimum 199 \ntemperature. Biomes are predicted based on the bioclimatic tolerances of 12 Plant Functional Types 200 \n(PFT) ranging from cushion forbs to tropical evergreen trees. At the core of the model is a coupled 201 \ncarbon-water flux scheme which maximises Net Primary Productivity (NPP) for any given PFT 202 \nthrough the determination of Leaf Area Index (LAI). This is calculated on a daily simulation of the soil 203 \nwater balance, canopy conductance, photosynthesis and respiration. The woody PFT that achieves 204 \nthe highest annual NPP at its maximised LAI for a given grid square is considered dominant. This 205 \nhowever is not the case for grass-tree areas such as savannas; here a weighted NPP is calculated and 206 \ninferred fire risks are both used to determine the forest-grassland boundary. The model then orders 207 \nall the PFTs that could exist under ambient conditions in a grid cell based on NPP, LAI and mean 208 \nannual soil moisture. It then uses semi-empirical rules to decide on which of the 27 biomes should 209 \nbe plotted in the cell (Kaplan 2001). For the Late Miocene simulations BIOME4 was run in anomaly 210 \nmode. This is a standard technique that removes known systematic errors in the climate prediction 211 \nof HadAM3 and has been employed in numerous modern and palaeoclimate\/palaeoecological 212 \nstudies (e.g. Haxeltine and Prentice, 1996; Texier et al., 1997; Salzmann et al., 2008). 213 \n 214 \n2.4. Coupling of the data and model 215 \n10 \n \nTo provide a global vegetation reconstruction it is necessary to fill the regions with limited 216 \npalaeoecological data (Fig. 1; Fig. 3) with vegetation. In this study the technique of Salzmann et al. 217 \n(2008), using a state-of-the-art model simulation and merging this with the palaeoecological data is 218 \nemployed. Before the process of merging the data and model into a hybrid reconstruction of global 219 \nTortonian vegetation it was first necessary to determine which Late Miocene HadAM3 experiment 220 \nwas best suited for this purpose. The original HadAM3 experiments presented in Lunt et al. (2008; 221 \nMioc1-Mioc7) were all used to produce BIOME4 vegetation predictions. Mioc1-Mioc7 represent 222 \nseven HadAM3 experiments with different SST gradient profiles, generated with the equation 223 \ndescribed in section 2.3. The resulting BIOME4 estimates were compared to the Tortonian data 224 \ncollected in TEVIS and MAD, using ArcGIS9 software. Before comparison could begin the 225 \npalaeoecological data was were first palaeo-rotated to its Tortonian latitude and longitude (using 226 \nthe palaeo-rotation codes of Paul Markwick ensuring consistency between our data and the 227 \nTortonian palaeogeography used in HadAM3). To aid comparison and selection, Cohen\u2019s Kappa 228 \nstatistic (Cohen, 1960) was used to highlight the statistically most comparable BIOME4 model 229 \nsimulation (Table 1). Cohen\u2019s Kappa statistic measures the agreement between two sets of 230 \ncategorizations while taking into account chance agreements between categories, where 0 means 231 \nthe agreement is no better than chance and 1 shows a perfect fit (Cohen, 1960; Jenness and Wynne, 232 \n2005). BIOME4 simulations Mioc1 \u2013 Mioc7 were compared using both the full and mega biome 233 \nclassification schemes of the BIOME4 model. The use of the broader mega biome scheme, following 234 \nHarrison and Prentice (2003) and Salzmann et al. (2009), was necessary due to avoid the Kappa 235 \nstatistic becoming meaningless due to some categories containing a low number of sample points 236 \nfor the full biome scheme. Of the experiments, Mioc5 compared most favourably to the 237 \npalaeobotanical and palaeoecological data (i.e. achieved the highest Kappa score using the mega 238 \nbiome scheme) and this experiment was therefore chosen for use in the construction of the data-239 \nmodel hybrid. Mioc5 represents a reduced equator to pole gradient in the Northern Hemisphere, 240 \nwith SSTs around 9\u00b0C warmer at 60\u00b0N (compared to the pre-industrial). The equator to pole gradient 241 \n11 \n \nin the Southern Hemisphere is slightly reduced when compared to the pre-industrial gradient but 242 \nwith SSTs 3 - 4\u00b0C higher. Equatorial SSTs are 1\u00b0C warmer than in the pre-industrial (Table 1). 243 \nThe strategy used to join the databased vegetation with model predicted vegetation is summarised 244 \nin Fig. 4 and based on the techniques used in Salzmann et al. (2008). The merger was undertaken on 245 \na grid by grid basis; examining each model predicted grid cell and, if necessary, correcting it using 246 \navailable palaeobotanical data. This is most visible in Fig. 5, which shows the consistency of the data 247 \n\u2013 model comparison and the degree of correction. Areas with low or no palaeobotanical data are left 248 \nunchanged as model predicted vegetation. 249 \n 250 \n3. Results 251 \n 252 \n3.1. Global Tortonian vegetation reconstruction 253 \nThe plotted biomes, based on 240 TEVIS and MAD data points, provide an insight into Late Miocene 254 \nvegetation and climate. There is good data coverage in western USA, Europe, India, southeast Asia 255 \nand western South America, allowing a confident vegetation reconstruction for these regions. This 256 \nallows for a confident robust vegetation-reconstruction for these regions. Data coverage also allows 257 \na confident reconstruction of Alaska, central Africa, parts of Asia and southern Australia. However, 258 \ndata coverage is not uniform and thus areas lacking adequate coverage rely on modelled vegetation 259 \nfor the reconstruction. These areas include most of the high latitude Northern Hemisphere including 260 \nmuch of Canada and northeast USA, Greenland, Scandinavia and Russia. Other areas of poor 261 \ncoverage also include eastern South America, southern Africa and northern Australia. 262 \nThe Tortonian vegetation reconstruction from both the palaeobotanical data and the BIOME4 model 263 \nprediction show a warmer and moister world (Fig.6A). The following section describes and highlights 264 \n12 \n \nregional vegetation patterns from the Tortonian world. Numbers in parentheses refer to 265 \npalaeobotanical site location numbers (Fig. 1) and numbers within parentheses with an \u201cM\u201d relate to 266 \nmammal site location numbers (Fig. 3). All references for specific sites, and the biome code assigned 267 \nto each has been made available as supplementary information (Appendices 1, 2). Climatic data is 268 \nare also presented below in the form of Mean Annual Temperature (MAT) in \u00b0C and Mean Annual 269 \nPrecipitation (MAP) in mm per year. The climatic data is also presented in Table 2. 270 \n 271 \n3.1.1. Polar and boreal regions 272 \nDuring the Tortonian the polar and boreal regions (>60\u00b0N, >60\u00b0S) were dominated by cold evergreen 273 \nconiferous forests and temperate grasslands. In Eurasia and Greenland there is also an extension of 274 \ntemperate deciduous broadleaved forests from the temperate region. Antarctica is not vegetated in 275 \nthis reconstruction, which is in agreement with the extinction of tundra from Antarctica during the 276 \nMiddle Miocene (Lewis et al., 2008). The ANDRILL AND-2A core, drilled in McMurdo Sound, yielded a 277 \npalynological assemblage showing the presence of tundra vegetation between 15.7-15.5 Ma. 278 \nFollowing this warm period the content of palynomorphs decreases sharply until they are absent 279 \nbefore the start of the Tortonian (Warny et al., 2009). On Seymour Island and James Ross Island, 280 \nAntarctic Peninsula the Hobbs Glacier formation has been dated as Late Miocene (Dingle and 281 \nLavelle, 1998; Marenssi et al., 2010).This marine diamictite is considered to have been deposited 282 \nclose to a glacier terminus suggesting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was almost at its present extent 283 \non the Antarctic Peninsula, though with evidence for interglacial events (Smellie et al., 2006; 284 \nMarenssi et al., 2010). Previously tundra vegetation had been reported from the Pliocene of the 285 \nTransantarctic Mountains (Ashworth and Cantrill, 2004). The dating of these deposits was based on 286 \nthe assemblage of reworked marine diatoms (Harwood, 1986), more recent work has suggested an 287 \nage >5.1 Ma and likely much older (Ackert and Kurz, 2004; Ashworth et al., 2007). The growing body 288 \nof evidence from Antarctica suggests that by the Tortonian the continent was largely glaciated. 289 \nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Font: Italic\n13 \n \nThe polar and boreal realms are not well constrained in the Tortonian reconstruction. A scarcity of 290 \nTortonian palaeobotanical data in Canada, Scandinavia and northern Russia (Fig. 6A), combined with 291 \nan extension of the continent into the modern Arctic Ocean north of Scandinavia and the 292 \nNovosibirsk Islands extending to Svalbard in the palaeogeography means much of the high latitude 293 \nbiomes are model-defined. Likewise Antarctica is defined as having near-modern ice sheet cover in 294 \nthe model boundary conditions, meaning that the BIOME4 model would not predict vegetation on 295 \nthe Antarctic continent. There are some locations that provide evidence of vegetation at the high 296 \nlatitudes during the Tortonian. In Alaska, around the Cook Inlet and Nenana Coal Field (Sites 1-5) 297 \nthere was a cool mixed forest to 61\u00b0N and a mix of cool needleleaf and cold evergreen needleleaf 298 \nforest further north. Three of the five sites give a mean annual temperature of 4.5\u00b11.5\u00b0C, 4\u00b11\u00b0C and 299 \n10\u00b110\u00b0C (Wolfe, 1994b; White et al., 1997; Reinink-Smith and Leopold, 2005); this is 4-10\u00b0C warmer 300 \nthan present. The palaeobotanical data and model agreed well on the position of the cold evergreen 301 \nneedleleaf forests but differed on the position of the cool mixed forest. In the BIOME4 model 302 \nsimulation the area with cool mixed forest palaeobotanical data is reconstructed to have temperate 303 \ndeciduous broadleaved forest and warm-temperate evergreen and mixed forest biomes. This 304 \ndiscrepancy between the BIOME4 predictions and the palaeobotanical data is related to the SST 305 \nprofile used in the model boundary conditions. 306 \nIn the North Atlantic (Sites 72-73), ocean cores provide evidence of terrestrial biomes during the 307 \nTortonian. DSDP 338 provides evidence of a temperate forest dominated by coniferous trees at 67\u00b0N 308 \noffshore Norway (Koreneva et al., 2005). ODP Leg 151 contains a pollen assemblage showing the 309 \npresence of a swampy taiga at 77\u00b0N on the Hovg\u00e5rd Ridge (Boulter and Manum, 1997). In Russia 310 \nthere is evidence of the evergreen taiga forest at 70\u00b0N (Site 139) and a temperate evergreen forest 311 \nat 59\u00b0N (Site 141). The model successfully predicts the presence of the cold evergreen needleleaf 312 \nforest at 77\u00b0N, but does not predict the presence of the temperate evergreen needleaf forest seen 313 \nat DSDP 338. Whether this relates to problems in the model prescribed SSTs or is due to the sample 314 \ncoming from an oceanic core rather than a terrestrial deposit will need to be explored in future 315 \n14 \n \nwork. Khapchan (Site 140) was described by Nikitin (2007) as a northeastern Turgayan Flora (warm-316 \ntemperate mixed forest) and contains a diverse seed assemblage of 130 taxa containing; Alnus, 317 \nBetula, Brasenia, Cyperaceae, Ericaceae Myricaceae, Rosa, Rubus, Tubela, Vitaceae and Weigela, 318 \n(Nikitin, 2007). This site represents a Turgayan Flora near the transition period in northeastern Asia, 319 \nfrom the Oligocene-Miocene Turgayan flora to the Pliocene-recent flora (Nikitin, 2007). Nikitin 320 \n(2007) classified it as a Turgayan flora despite the absence of Taxodium and the minor amount of 321 \nbroadleaved taxa. This may mean that in terms of the biome classification of the BIOME4 model the 322 \nflora at Khapchan no longer represents a warm-temperate mixed forest, which the Turgayan Flora is 323 \nconsidered to be. This will require future investigations to establish a suitable BIOME4 classification 324 \nfor a northeastern Turgayan Flora and therefore it is omitted from the present reconstruction. 325 \n 326 \nAs data is are scarce for the boreal and polar realms, these regions rely heavily on the BIOME4 327 \nmodel for the Tortonian reconstruction. Across North America, BIOME4 predicts a direct transition 328 \nfrom boreal taiga to temperate grasslands at 60\u00b0N in central Canada and 68\u00b0N in western Canada 329 \n(Fig. 6A). In northernmost North America, BIOME4 predicts a mixture of temperate grassland, boreal 330 \ntaiga and temperate xerophytic shrubland. In northeast Russia, the model predicts extensive 331 \ntemperate grasslands from 66\u00b0N to 78\u00b0N with temperate deciduous broadleaved forest reaching 332 \n78\u00b0N between the longitudes of 25\u00b0E and 36\u00b0E. This then changes to cool needleleaf forest at 78\u00b0N, 333 \nwhereas, for most of the polar boreal region temperate grassland is predicted to change directly into 334 \nboreal taiga forest, much as it does in North America (Fig. 6A). There are also minor areas of cool 335 \nmixed forest, cool needleleaf forests and temperate xerophytic shrubland within the extensive 336 \ntemperate grassland region, these same minor biomes are also found on the west coast. At 60\u00b0N the 337 \nBIOME4 model predicts the presence of warm-temperate forest on the east coast of Eurasia (Fig. 338 \n6A). In eastern Russia and the Kamchatka Peninsula the boreal taiga is predicted by BIOME4 to have 339 \nhad a much lower southern extent at 55\u00b0N and changes directly to temperate grassland. BIOME4 340 \nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Font: Italic\n15 \n \nshows the presence of boreal forest mixed with some areas of temperate grassland and in the 341 \nnorthernmost area, a small region of deciduous boreal taiga. Along the southern coast of the 342 \nKamchatka Peninsula, the model predicts a mix of cool mixed and cool needleleaf forest (Fig. 6A). 343 \nCurrently there are no published palaeobotanical sites for the Tortonian of Greenland. The BIOME4 344 \nmodel predicts a large expanse of temperate grassland in the northwest and central areas with 345 \ntemperate forests in the south and east. In the far northeast and northwest, small areas of 346 \ntemperate xerophytic shrubland are predicted to have existed (Fig. 6A). In the boundary conditions 347 \nof the GCM experiment, based on the palaeogeography (Markwick, 2007), the east Greenland 348 \nhighlands are covered by an ice-sheet and thus were not vegetated. Despite the lack of data on 349 \nGreenland, good data coverage on Iceland (Sites 68-71) shows a warm-temperate to temperate 350 \nclimate during the Tortonian. This provides some evidence to support temperate forest on 351 \nGreenland at this latitude during the Tortonian. All the areas on Greenland defined by the BIOME4 352 \nmodel are generated from the climate of the best fit GCM experiment and a single data datum point 353 \ncould confirm or change these regions. There are no model-predicted biomes for Antarctica because 354 \nthe palaeogeography used in the model boundary conditions have has a modern Antarctic ice sheet. 355 \n 356 \n3.1.2 Temperate zones 357 \nThe BIOME4 model predicts a considerable extension of the temperate zone into what is present 358 \nboreal and polar regions. Data coverage in the temperate zone (23.5-60\u00b0N\/\u00b0S) is good. Notable areas 359 \nof absence are the Appalachians in the eastern USA, north Mexico, Australia and southernmost 360 \nSouth America. Broadly the reconstruction shows a spread of warm-temperate evergreen 361 \nbroadleaved and mixed forest into Europe, Southeast Asia, eastern USA and areas of western USA 362 \nand an expansion of temperate deciduous broadleaved savanna in Eurasia and central USA. 363 \n16 \n \nOn the west of the Rocky Mountains, a mixture of forest, woodland and savanna occured until 38\u00b0N, 364 \nbelow this the area was dominated by temperate xerophytic shrubland with some coastal forests. At 365 \n55\u00b0N on what is now the Queen Charlotte Islands, Canada, there was a warm-temperate evergreen 366 \nmixed forest (Site 6). To the south of this there was temperate needleleaf forest (Site 7) near the 367 \ncoast and temperate deciduous broadleaved forest further inland (Site 8). South of this at between 368 \n43\u00b0N and 48\u00b0N, many locations show the presence of a warm-temperate evergreen and mixed forest 369 \n(Sites 9-12, 14 and 19-21). The forest at Musselshell Creek (Baghai and Jorstad, 1995) had a MAT of 370 \n12.5\u00b11.5\u00b0C and a MAP of 1250 mm (Site 14), this is 7\u00b0C warmer than at present and nearly 500 371 \nmm\/yr wetter. South of this is temperate broadleaved savanna near the coast at Kimble Homestead 372 \n(Site 13), which is estimated to have a MAT of 12.5\u00b12.5\u00b0C, comparable to the warm-temperate 373 \nevergreen and mixed forest but, with a MAP of 900\u00b1100 mm (Retallack et al., 2002). Further inland 374 \nthere was a mix of temperate broadleaved deciduous forest (Site 15) and temperate schlerophyll 375 \nwoodland and shrubland (Sites 16, 17). The former having a MAT of 14\u00b0C and a MAP of 635\u00b1180 mm 376 \n(Dorf, 1938) and the latter estimated to have a MAT of 13.4\u00b17.8\u00b0C and a MAP of 762 mm (Smith, 377 \n1941; Beuchler et al., 2007). For this area the climate data provided by the palaeobotanical locations 378 \nsuggests an increase in MAT of 7-8\u00b0C and an increase in MAP of 50-200 mm\/yr compared to modern 379 \ninformation. The model disagrees with the palaeobotanical data within this region on the amount of 380 \nMAP, causing the model to predict much drier biomes. The Rocky Mountains are shown to have had 381 \nsome areas of cool mixed forest (Site 18) and areas of temperate needleleaf open woodland (Fig. 6). 382 \nSouth of 38\u00b0N, an open area of temperate xerophytic shrubland is predicted by the BIOME4 model 383 \nand supported by numerous palaeobotanical locations (Sites 23, 25-27). This open area extended 384 \ndown to the tropical zone, apart from a coastal forest with a warm-temperate evergreen and mixed 385 \ncharacter (Sites 22, 24) at 31-33\u00b0N (Fig. 6). This is estimated to have had a MAT of 15\u00b14\u00b0C and a MAP 386 \nof 679\u00b162.5 mm (Axelrod, 2000); although the level of precipitation seems low to support this type 387 \nof forest, Axelrod (2000) compared it to cloud forests of Pacific Islands, suggesting it may have 388 \nrequired extensive summer fogs. The modelled biomes and the palaeobotanical data agree well with 389 \n17 \n \nthe distribution and extent of the temperate xerophytic shrubland and the presence of coastal 390 \nwarm-temperate forest. 391 \nEast of the open temperate xerophytic shrubland, the BIOME4 model and the palaeoecological data 392 \nagree on the presence of a mixture of temperate needleleaf forest and temperate deciduous 393 \nbroadleaved savanna (Sites 28-31 and M1). Along the Gulf Coast there was a mixture of warm-394 \ntemperate evergreen and mixed forest (Site 37) and tropical semi-deciduous broadleaved forest 395 \n(Site 36). In Florida, mammalian fossils and pollen at the Moss Acres Racetrack site (Lambert, 1994; 396 \nLambert, 1997) show the presence of a temperate to warm-temperate, deciduous broadleaved 397 \nsavanna (Sites M2-M3). On the east coast of the USA there was a warm-temperate evergreen mixed 398 \nforest until 46\u00b0N (Sites 32-35). Further inland where the palaeobotanical data is are absent, the 399 \nBIOME4 model predicts a mixture of temperate deciduous broadleaved forests, temperate 400 \ndeciduous broadleaved savanna and temperate grasslands (Fig. 6). The warm-temperate evergreen 401 \nand mixed forest on the east coast, this biome at Martha\u2019s Vineyard and preserved in the Legler 402 \nLignite is predicted to have a MAT of between 13.3\u00b15\u00b0C and 15\u00b19\u00b0C with a MAP of 1270 mm (Greller 403 \nand Rachele, 1983; Frederiksen, 1984; Axelrod, 2000). 404 \nIn Europe the palaeobotanical data indicate a vast swathe of warm-temperate evergreen and mixed 405 \nforest with subtropical elements, from 8\u00b0W to 51\u00b0E and from 38\u00b0N to 60\u00b0N (Sites 79-99, 103-110, 406 \n119). Within this biome, which is considered most comparable to the warm-temperate forests of 407 \nsoutheast China, climate estimates for the Tortonian from the fossil remains are predicted to have 408 \nhad a MAT of 14.85\u00b10.95\u00b0C \u2013 16.8\u00b11.2\u00b0C and a MAP of between 988.5\u00b19.5 mm and 1242.5\u00b155.5 mm 409 \n(Figueiral et al., 1999; Ivanov et al., 2002; Kvacek et al., 2002; Bruch et al., 2006; Syabryaj et al., 410 \n2007; Erdei et al., 2009). This is around 6.3\u00b0C warmer than at present (the range of difference is -411 \n2.4\u00b0C \u2013 +8.5\u00b0C) and the difference in MAP is between 159 mm to 740 mm when compared to 412 \nmodern data. Areas of difference to this apparently homogenous biome are the Iberian Peninsula 413 \nand the land to the south of the Pannonian Lake in Turkey. In this region, the warm-temperate 414 \n18 \n \nevergreen and mixed forest opened up into a region of temperate deciduous broadleaved savanna 415 \n(Site 111; 115-116) and BIOME4 predicted temperate needleleaf forest. Further east the vegetation 416 \nreturned to warm-temperate evergreen and mixed forest (Sites 117-118). Continuing east from here 417 \nthere was a region of temperate deciduous broadleaved savanna (Sites M13-M14), and BIOME4 418 \npredicted temperate needleleaf forest extending to 62\u00b0E (Fig. 6). The model and palaeobotanical 419 \ndata agrees well for Europe around the Panonnian Lake however, the model makes western Europe 420 \nanomalously dry. 421 \nThe Iberian Peninsula also had drier open vegetation than the rest of Europe. On the south coast 422 \nthere was a region of tropical xerophytic shrubland (Site 76), and along the west coast there was a 423 \nsmall amount of temperate schlerophyll woodland and shrubland (Site 75). The modern Sahara was 424 \ngreatly reduced, if not absent altogether (Fig. 6). Temperate schlerophyll woodland and shrubland 425 \n(Sites 77-78) and tropical savanna (Site M7) inhabited coastal regions of northwest Africa (Tunisia, 426 \nMorocco and Algeria). Further inland there is no vegetation data and the BIOME4 model predicts 427 \ntropical xerophytic shrubland and small areas of desert (Fig. 6). The mix of predominantly tropical 428 \nxerophytic shrubland and desert continued east across the modern Sahara region until 21\u00b0E, from 429 \nhere until the east coast of the Arabian Peninsula there was extensive tropical xerophytic shrubland 430 \nand an absence of desert. The area around the modern Nile delta had tropical savanna along the 431 \ncoast (Site 112). The BIOME4 model agrees with the palaeobotanical data in that the Iberian 432 \nPeninsula has more open vegetation than the rest of Europe. However, there is some disagreement 433 \nas to which biome types are present. The BIOME4 model also fails to predict the coastal vegetation 434 \nof North Africa; this may be a problem with the model or a question of scale. The palaeobotanical 435 \ndata may reflect vegetation restricted to the coast whereas the model has predicted the overall 436 \nbiome for the grid cell; this will require further study. 437 \nAlong the east coast of the Pannonian Lake, the BIOME4 model predicts a mixture of temperate 438 \nxerophytic shrubland and temperate needleleaf forests (Fig. 6A). These temperate needleleaf forests 439 \n19 \n \nare predicted by BIOME4 to continue, in isolated patches, until 81\u00b0E. These forest patches are within 440 \nan extensive temperate deciduous broadleaved savanna (Sites 137-138, 144, M15) which existed 441 \nfrom 35\u00b0N to 58\u00b0N in Asia. At the northern extent of the savanna area it is bordered by temperate 442 \ndeciduous woodland which inhabited some of the boreal realm during the Tortonian (Fig. 6). At its 443 \nsouthern limit, the BIOME4 model predicts the temperate savanna blended into temperate 444 \nneedleleaf forest and temperate needleleaf parkland. The palaeobotanical data shows that the 445 \nmodel simulation for this region produces a biome pattern with anomalously high levels of forest. 446 \nSouth of the Himalayas on the Indian subcontinent a band of warm-temperate evergreen and mixed 447 \nforest ran longitudinally between 28\u00b0N and 33\u00b0N (Sites 169, 177). Below this there was a mixture of 448 \ntropical evergreen broadleaved forest, tropical deciduous forest and tropical savanna (Sites 170-449 \n175), and these biome types continued into the tropical zone (Fig. 6). In China and southeast Asia, 450 \nthe warm-temperate forests continued in the longitudinal band between 23.5\u00b0N and 33\u00b0N (Sites 451 \n182, 185). Fossils from the Xiolongtan coal mine in China are estimated to have lived with a MAT of 452 \n17.9\u00b11.2\u00b0C with a MAP of 1427\u00b1212 mm (Xia et al., 2009), this is nearly modern levels for this region. 453 \nAs this band of warm-temperate evergreen and mixed forest reached the east coast of Asia it 454 \nfollowed it north, reaching 48\u00b0N (Sites 147-148, 156, 158-159, 161). In Japan, many fossil sites 455 \nindicate this forest biome also existed there (Sites 162-163, 166-168). Throughout India and 456 \nsoutheast Asia the model compares very well to the palaeobotanical data and only required slight 457 \nalterations to create the hybrid reconstruction. 458 \nOn the Himalayan Plateau and further north a patchwork of temperate xerophytic shrubland (Site 459 \n152), temperate deciduous broadleaved savanna (Sites 142, 145-146, 149-151, 153-155, 198, M16), 460 \ntemperate deciduous broadleaved forest (Site 143) was present during the Tortonian. At the 461 \nnorthern limit of the temperate zone, BIOME4 predicted cool needleleaf forest existed at this time 462 \n(Fig. 6). This mixture of biome types continued north until it bordered an extensive temperate 463 \ngrassland predicted by BIOME4. In north central Asia the transition from temperate biomes to the 464 \n20 \n \ncold evergreen needleleaf forest biome occurred as far south as 55\u00b0N (Fig. 6); currently there is no 465 \navailable data to confirm this transition. This region in the BIOME4 simulation is heavily influenced 466 \nby the orography which is the reason for minor differences with the palaeobotanical data. For the 467 \nmajority of this region the model predicted temperate grassland or temperate deciduous 468 \nbroadleaved forest, whereas the palaeobotanical data reflected a temperate deciduous broadleaved 469 \nsavanna. 470 \nIn South America, the temperate zone contains many sites along the western side and sparse data 471 \nalong the east. On the east coast BIOME4 predicts a continuation of tropical vegetation into the 472 \ntemperate zone, this is mainly tropical xerophytic shrubland with some areas of semi-deciduous to 473 \ndeciduous tropical forest (Fig. 6). At Taubate, Brazil (Site 57) pollen provides evidence of a 474 \nsubtropical to warm-temperate forest along the coast (Garcia et al., 2008). On the west side of the 475 \nSouth American temperate zone, tropical xerophytic shrubland changed to tropical savanna (Sites 476 \n60-61, M5) and a proto-Atacama desert (Site 58) at 24-26\u00b0S. South of this, an area of temperate 477 \nxerophytic shrubland occupied a narrow band (Site 62) before changing into temperate schlerophyll 478 \nwoodland and shrubland (Site 63). South of this area there is scarce data, apart from an area of 479 \ntemperate xerophytic shrubland (Sites 64-66) between 39\u00b0S and 46\u00b0S. For the rest of southern South 480 \nAmerica, BIOME4 predicts a mixture of warm-temperate to cool-temperate forests (Fig. 6). The 481 \npalaeoecological data and BIOME4 model compare well for temperate South America. Model-482 \npredicted biomes that required altering for the hybrid reconstruction were either too dry or too wet. 483 \nThis seemingly contradictory statement is probably related to the orography; both within the model 484 \nboundary conditions and the orography the palaeoecological data existed at. 485 \nThe temperate zone of southern Africa is small and poorly-covered by data. The temperate zone is 486 \npredicted, by BIOME4, to start with a continuation of the tropical xerophytic shrubland until 28\u00b0S to 487 \n31\u00b0S where tropical semi-deciduous and deciduous forests are predicted to begin. The data points 488 \ncome below this area, from western South Africa and they show the presence of a temperate 489 \n21 \n \nneedleleaf forest (Sites 135-136). For the South African Cape, BIOME4 predicts a warm-temperate 490 \nevergreen and mixed forest (Fig. 6). The model-predicted biomes around the South African Cape 491 \nwere too dry to match the limited palaeobotanical data for the area. This shows there is some 492 \nproblem in the amount of precipitation generated by the model for this region. 493 \nIn Australia, the temperate zone was dominated by temperate schlerophyll woodland and shrubland 494 \nduring the Tortonian (Sites 211-213, 215-216). Location 212 at Lake Tay predicts this biome to have a 495 \nMAP of 1375\u00b1125 mm (Macphail, 1997), which was an increase of around 1100 mm\/yr when 496 \ncompared to modern data. A small area of temperate grassland was present in southeast Australia 497 \n(Site 214) and BIOME4 predicts coastal warm-temperate evergreen and mixed forest and temperate 498 \nneedleleaf forest along the east coast (Fig. 6). In central Australia, the model also predicts an area of 499 \ntropical grassland. On New Zealand, many data points agree with the BIOME 4 prediction of warm-500 \ntemperate evergreen and mixed forest (Sites 218-220). Overall the palaeobotanical data and model-501 \ngenerated biomes for temperate Australia compare well in places, but broadly the model predicts 502 \nbiomes that are too dry. 503 \n 504 \n3.2.3. Tropical zones 505 \nThe tropical zones (23.5\u00b0S \u2013 23.5\u00b0N) have good data coverage. Notable exceptions are southern 506 \nAfrica, Central America, eastern South America and northern Australia. In general there is an 507 \nopening up of the tropical forests of South America, an expansion of tropical vegetation into the 508 \nSahara Desert in Africa, extensive tropical forests in India and southeast Asia and open biomes in 509 \nAustralia. 510 \nIn Central America, palaeobotanical data show the presence of a warm-temperate evergreen and 511 \nmixed forest (Site 38) at Jalapa, Mexico (Graham, 1975) where a warm oak-liquidambar forest 512 \nbordered mangroves. Further south, near Gracias, Honduras (Site M4) an assemblage of mammals 513 \n22 \n \nshows that a tropical savanna occupied the region during the Tortonian (Webb and Perrigo, 1984). 514 \nApart from these sites the rest of Central America is predicted by BIOME4 (Fig. 6). In the north, 515 \ntropical xerophytic shrubland and temperate schlerophyll woodland and shrubland continued into 516 \nthe tropical zone from the temperate zone. Below 20\u00b0N a patchwork mixture of tropical savanna, 517 \ntropical deciduous woodland and tropical semi-evergreen forest is predicted to have existed. At the 518 \nPanama Seaway, BIOME4 predicts a tropical evergreen broadleaved forest (Fig. 6). The limited 519 \npalaeoecological data for Central America make a comprehensive data-model comparison difficult, 520 \nbut based on the available evidence the model appears to simulate vegetation here well. 521 \nCrossing this seaway into South America, a broad expanse of predominantly tropical evergreen 522 \nbroadleaved forest (Sites 41, 44, 46-47, 49, 51-52), with some isolated areas of tropical deciduous 523 \nwoodland (Sites 42-43, 45) and along the edges of this forest BIOME4 predicts tropical semi-524 \nevergreen forest and tropical deciduous woodland existed. This forest opened up into tropical 525 \nsavanna (Sites 50, 53-54) which continued east across South America to between 46\u00b0W-38\u00b0W where, 526 \nin an absence of data, BIOME4 predicts tropical xerophytic shrubland (Fig. 6). Some evidence for 527 \ntropical evergreen broadleaved forest along the coast is present on Outeiro Island, Brazil (Site 48). 528 \nNear 23.5\u00b0S on the east side of South America there is a lack of data and BIOME4 predicts an area of 529 \ntropical deciduous woodland within the extensive tropical savanna. In eastern South America, at this 530 \nlatitude there is evidence for tropical deciduous woodland (Sites 55-56). This eastern tropical 531 \ndeciduous forest biome is estimated to have a MAT of 19.8\u00b13.7\u00b0C \u2013 21.5\u00b12.5\u00b0C and a MAP of 532 \n550\u00b1180 mm at Upper Jakokkota (Gregory-Wodzicki, 2002). This is an increase of 9-10\u00b0C when 533 \ncompared to the modern, but a reduction in MAP of about 570 mm. The BIOME4 model generated 534 \nbiomes and palaeobotanical data for tropical South America compare very well. The majority of the 535 \npalaeobotanical data is are grouped in the west and this shows the extent of the tropical forest 536 \nsuccessfully predicted by the model to be. It also clearly indicates the areas with tropical savanna 537 \nand tropical deciduous forest predicted by the model and supported by the palaeobotanical data. In 538 \nthe east of tropical South America there is only a single, coastal, data point. This pollen record 539 \n23 \n \nhowever shows the model is anomalously dry in this region and the model generated biomes 540 \nrequired modification for the hybrid reconstruction. 541 \nThe tropical zone of Africa, south of the Sahara was an extensive tropical xerophytic shrubland 542 \nduring the Tortonian (Fig. 6). This turned into tropical savanna at between 15-20\u00b0N (Sites 123, M8), 543 \nexcept on the Arabian Peninsula where xerophytic shrubland is the dominant biome with minor 544 \namounts of tropical grasslands along rivers and the coast (Site 120). In West Africa, tropical forests 545 \nbegan at 16\u00b0N (Sites 121-122) but were mainly restricted to coastal grid squares and tropical 546 \nsavanna is found as far south as 6\u00b0N (Site 128). In central Africa, the tropical forests occupied a 547 \nregion comparable to the modern forests. Data for this comes from the Niger Delta in the west (Sites 548 \n129-130) and Kenya in the east (Sites 131-132) with BIOME4 supporting the data and showing the 549 \nextent of the forest (Fig. 6). Climatic estimates for the tropical forest in Kenya give a MAT of 550 \n21.7\u00b12\u00b0C and a MAP of 1045\u00b1200 mm (Jacobs and Deino, 1996); this is comparable to modern levels. 551 \nAround Ethiopia and Sudan, an area of tropical evergreen forest was present (Site 124) surrounded 552 \nby tropical savanna (Site 127) and tropical grassland (Sites 125-126). Apart from the sites mentioned, 553 \nthere is an absence of other data points for tropical Africa and so the reconstruction relies on 554 \nBIOME4. Between 1\u00b0S and 6\u00b0S, the tropical forests opened up into tropical savanna with isolated 555 \npatches of tropical deciduous woodland. At around 19\u00b0S this gave way to tropical xerophytic 556 \nshrubland and a small Namib Desert. Along the east coast of Africa BIOME4 predicts tropical 557 \nxerophytic shrubland (Fig. 6). From the palaeoecological data available for tropical Africa it is clear 558 \nthat the data and model compare closely. Modifications to the model-predicted biomes was mainly 559 \nrestricted to the savanna-xerophytic shrubland boundary which mammalian sites showed was too 560 \nfar south by the distance of a grid cell. 561 \nIn tropical India, palaeobotanical data is are confined to the south and northeast of the subcontinent 562 \nand indicates the presence of a tropical evergreen broadleaved forest (Sites 179-181, 195-197, 199-563 \n201). Away from these regions the vegetation is predicted by BIOME4 (Fig. 6). The biomes predicted 564 \n24 \n \nshow a mixture of tropical evergreen, semi-evergreen and deciduous forests along the coast and 565 \ntropical savanna inland. Moving east, data from Vietnam show the warm-temperate evergreen and 566 \nmixed forest as far south as 18\u00b0N (Sites 185-191). This forest opened up to tropical savanna (Site 567 \nM17) and tropical grassland (Site 194) along the west of the southeast Asian peninsula. On the east 568 \nside, a mixture of warm-temperate evergreen and mixed forest (Sites 203-204) and tropical 569 \nevergreen broadleaved forest (Site 205) existed. Below 11\u00b0N, an absence of data means the 570 \nvegetation is predicted by BIOME4. From 11\u00b0N to 5\u00b0N, the model predicts an area of semi-evergreen 571 \ntropical forest with isolated tropical savanna, below 5\u00b0N BIOME4 predicts the presence of tropical 572 \nevergreen broadleaved forest (Fig. 6). This is supported by a pollen assemblage from Brunei (Site 573 \n207). As in the temperate zone, the model predicted tropical zone of India and southeast Asia 574 \ncompares well to palaeoecological data requiring only minor modifications for the hybrid 575 \nreconstruction. 576 \nPalaeobotanical sites for the Australian tropical zone are exceedingly sparse. ODP 765 (Site 208), 577 \nlocated immediately off the west coast, suggests the presence of a temperate schlerophyll woodland 578 \nwith an estimated MAP of 1050\u00b1450 mm (Martin and McMinn, 1994; MacPhail, 1997). On the east 579 \ncoast, there was a coastal temperate needleleaf forest (Site 210), which continued south into the 580 \ntemperate zone. The rest of tropical Australia is predicted by BIOME4 to be coastal tropical savanna 581 \nand tropical xerophytic shrubland until the temperate zone (Fig. 6). Limited data for the tropical 582 \nzone of Australia means the hybrid reconstruction relies on the model defined biomes. The available 583 \npalaeobotanical data shows that, as with the temperate zone of Australia, the tropical zone is too 584 \ndry in places. 585 \n 586 \n4. Discussion 587 \n 588 \n25 \n \n4.1. Tortonian vegetation and climate 589 \nThe Tortonian palaeoecological data show agreement with the predictions of the BIOME4 model, 590 \nwith higher than pre-industrial SSTs and atmospheric CO2 levels at 395 ppmv. The reconstruction of 591 \nTortonian biome distribution shows significant differences compared to the present-day potential 592 \nnatural vegetation, in the high latitudes and temperate realms (Fig. 6B). Differences are also seen in 593 \nthe tropics but these involve the change in distribution of modern tropical biomes, rather than the 594 \nmovement of biomes into regions where they do not exist today. Of these significant vegetation 595 \nshifts, the northwards shift of boreal taiga, temperate deciduous forest and temperate grasslands 596 \nare the most pronounced. Potential natural (i.e. without human influence) present day biome 597 \ndistribution (Fig. 2) shows the boreal forests (cold evergreen needleleaf and cold deciduous forests 598 \nof BIOME4) have a southern limit of ca. 45\u00b0N in east Eurasia and a northern limit of ca. 70\u00b0N in 599 \nnorthern Russia and Canada (Kaplan, 2001). During the Tortonian, the evergreen boreal forests 600 \nreached at least 77\u00b0N (Site 72) and in the reconstruction it extends to 80\u00b0N. Reconstructing the 601 \nsouthern limit is difficult due to a lack of data from the polar region. In Alaska it is at 61\u00b0N (Site 5) 602 \nand minimally at 70\u00b0N in Russia (Site 139). In the hybrid reconstruction, the BIOME4 model indicates 603 \nthe lowest occurrence of the boreal taiga forests is in east Eurasia at 55\u00b0N. This dramatic shift of the 604 \nboreal taiga by up to 10\u00b0 indicates significant high latitude warming relative to today. Accompanying 605 \nthis northward shift of the boreal taiga was a loss of tundra biomes (Fig. 6B). The northward shift of 606 \nthe boreal forests has been shown to be a vegetation\u2013climate positive feedback; with the treeline 607 \nmoving north altering the surface albedo and carbon budget of the high latitudes (de Noblet et al. 608 \n1996; Sturm et al. 2001). Inclusion of this Tortonian vegetation reconstruction, as a boundary 609 \ncondition in future modelling studies, may help to increase high northern latitude MATs and the 610 \nsimulation of a reduced pole to equator gradient. In this study the HadAM3-driven BIOME4 611 \nvegetation model was able to predict the northward shift of forest biomes but this required a 612 \nsignificant increase in SSTs (Table 1). These high SSTs could also be responsible for making model-613 \npredicted biomes for areas of western Europe, western USA, Australia, South Africa and eastern 614 \n26 \n \nSouth America too dry, when compared to the biomes reconstructed from the palaeoecological 615 \ndata. Although higher SSTs will create a more active hydrological cycle, the Mioc5 AGCM experiment 616 \nhas a global MAP increase of only 126.7 mm\/year relative to the pre-industrial scenario. From the 617 \nnumber of regions showing model-generated biomes that are too dry compared to palaeobotanical 618 \ndata, the increase in global precipitation is either not enough or is occurring in the wrong regions. 619 \nThese discrepancies in regions that current experiments make to dry will form part of future model 620 \nsimulations. These future simulations will include the Tortonian vegetation reconstruction presented 621 \nhere as a boundary condition instead of the global shrublands used by Lunt et al. (2008). 622 \nFollowing the cold taiga forests northwards were the temperate forests and temperate grassland 623 \nbiomes (Fig. 6). The extensive temperate grasslands predicted by BIOME4 are not supported by any 624 \npalaeobotanical data points. The data and BIOME4 model predictions agree on the presence of a 625 \nwarm-temperate evergreen and mixed forest in Europe bordering the Pannonian Lake, however in 626 \nwestern Europe BIOME4 predicts a much more fragmentary biome pattern than indicated by 627 \npalaeobotany. In places, the model predicts temperate evergreen needleleaf forests and tropical 628 \nxerophytic shrublands. This suggests the model interprets western Europe as too dry, and is most 629 \nlikely related to the increased MATs from the higher SSTs. This is because there is only a slight 630 \ndifference in the modelled MAP between the Late Miocene and the pre-industrial model 631 \nexperiments (Fig. 7). Considering the differences in climate between the Late Miocene model and 632 \nthose derived from palaeobotanical data for this biome; the model predicts slightly higher MATs 633 \n(within the range of the fossil data) and a MAP comparable to that estimated from the data (Table 634 \n2). The climatic data suggests the Tortonian MAT in Europe was at least 5-8\u00b0C warmer than the pre-635 \nindustrial age and received around 400 mm\/year more precipitation. This warm-wet climate across 636 \nEurope during the Tortonian is in agreement with studies using other proxies (Bohme et al., 2008). 637 \nThe palaeobotanical data and BIOME4 predictions for the western USA differ. In this region, the 638 \nmodel predicts a mixture of temperate grassland, temperate xerophytic shrubland and temperate 639 \n27 \n \nneedleleaf forest. The palaeobotanical data also suggests a mixture of biomes; warm-temperate 640 \nevergreen and mixed forest, temperate deciduous broadleaved savanna, temperate schlerophyll 641 \nwoodland and shrubland and temperate deciduous broadleaved forest. The differences between 642 \nBIOME4 and the data relates to the orography. It is a common problem for model-data discrepancies 643 \nin mountainous regions due to both the model resolution and preservation bias of the fossil record 644 \n(Salzmann et al., 2008). In the BIOME4 model, each 2.5\u00b0 x 3.75\u00b0 grid cell has its biome calculated 645 \nbased on the climate generated by the AGCM and the average altitude of the cell. In comparison, the 646 \npalaeobotanical data comes from a single locality. This area locality is within an area of deposition, 647 \ntypically lowland areas such as valley bottoms. This means that the palaeobotanical evidence for 648 \nmountain regions is often biased towards valley and low altitude habitats and not the regional 649 \nvegetation. This hampers a meaningful data-model comparison within mountainous regions 650 \n(Salzmann et al., 2008). 651 \nIn the reconstruction, there is a relatively small Sahara Desert, mainly based on the BIOME4 652 \nreconstruction. The model predicts an expansion of tropical xerophytic shrubland across most of the 653 \nmodern Sahara and the Arabian Peninsula; desert areas were restricted to the north and northeast 654 \nof the modern Sahara region (Fig. 6B). The palaeobotanical and mammalian evidence shows that 655 \nalong the Mediterranean coast, a mixture of temperate schlerophyll woodland and shrubland and 656 \ntropical savanna existed. Tropical grasslands are reconstructed for the east coast of the Arabian 657 \nPeninsula and tropical savanna was present along the modern southern margin of the Sahara desert. 658 \nEvidence for desert conditions in North Africa comes from sedimentological evidence in Chad. Here 659 \nwind-blown sandstones conformably underlie a mammal-bearing horizon dated as 7.4-6 Ma 660 \n(Vignaud et al., 2002; Schuster et al., 2006). Across the Sahara region there are however vertebrate 661 \nfossil sites that suggest more vegetated conditions. Fossil bushbabies (Galago farafraensis) from 662 \nEgypt provide evidence of a habitat with trees and an estimated rainfall of 500-1200 mm\/year 663 \n(Pickford et al., 2006); crocodiles from Tunisia also indicate more humid conditions (Pickford, 2000; 664 \nAgrasar, 2003). 665 \n28 \n \nIn South America, southeast Asia and tropical Africa the palaeobotanical data and BIOME4 666 \npredictions are consistent (Fig. 5). However in the Amazonian basin and Africa south of the equator, 667 \nthe absence of palaeobotanical data means the reconstruction relies entirely on BIOME4 (Fig. 5). In 668 \nEast Africa south of the equator the model predicts tropical xerophytic shrubland, this is the same 669 \nbiome predicted for this region in the Piacenzian (Salzmann et al., 2008). The difference between 670 \nthis Tortonian reconstruction and the Piacenzian reconstruction is the presence of palaeobotanical 671 \ndata in this region during the Piacenzian, allowing the reconstruction of tropical savanna rather than 672 \ntropical xerophytic shrubland. The difference for the Piacenzian between the AGCM and 673 \npalaeobotanical data was placed on the modelling of rainfall patterns possibly related to the Somali 674 \nJet (Salzmann et al., 2008). If this is a problem in the model then the same error may exist in the 675 \nTortonian simulations, further palaeobotanical exploration in the Horn of Africa and south along the 676 \neast side may help to prove or disprove the Tortonian vegetation reconstruction. 677 \nOf the available Tortonian AGCM experiments from Lunt et al. (2008), Mioc5 compared most 678 \nfavourably to the 240 palaeoecological data points. Statistically Mioc4 compared more favourably in 679 \nthe full biome scheme, but this model predicted a desert in the Amazonian Basin. Mioc5 achieved a 680 \nhigher Kappa score for the mega biome scheme and did not predict the desert in Amazonian Basin. 681 \nChoosing the experiment with the best megabiome score increases our confidence in the statistical 682 \ntest applied since; having a large number of categories with a low sample in each is less robust than 683 \nhaving fewer categories with more samples in each. A minimum of 50 samples per category should 684 \nbe used, and 75-100 samples for more than 12 categories (Congalton and Green, 1999; Jenness and 685 \nWynne, 2005). This is difficult for palaeontological studies where sample sizes are restricted by many 686 \nfactors such as deposition, taphonomy, preservation and limited exposure. This makes the mega 687 \nbiome Kappa scores more statistically robust than that for the full biome classification. Combining 688 \nthe palaeoecological data with the Mioc5-driven BIOME4 vegetation model required some model 689 \ndefined areas to be modified (Fig. 5). These include western USA, western temperate South America, 690 \nwestern Europe, central Asia, South Africa and Australia. All these regions are in the temperate zone 691 \n29 \n \nwhich may indicate the SST gradient used in the experiment was unsuitable. Some of the regions are 692 \nalso heavily influenced by orography which, as previously discussed, confounds palaeoecological 693 \ndata and model comparisons. Areas that compared favourably included eastern and central USA, 694 \ntropical South America, central Europe, tropical Africa and southeast Asia. These areas also include 695 \nregions in the temperate zone but mainly those in the tropics, showing that the SSTs for the tropical 696 \nzone were correctly defined. The limited palaeoecological data available in the polar zone provides 697 \nevidence that the prescribed SSTs for this climatic zone were well-defined, perhaps even too warm 698 \naround Alaska where the Mioc5 driven BIOME4 model predicts temperate to warm-temperate 699 \nbiomes. Palaeobotanical data for this region shows the presence of a cool mixed forest, a biome that 700 \nis colder than those predicted by the model. Overall, the prescribed SST gradient for the Mioc5 GCM 701 \nexperiment that generated the model-defined biome distribution best matches the available 702 \npalaeoecological data. However, the areas of data-model discrepancy show that further work is 703 \nrequired to correctly simulate the Tortonian climate. 704 \n 705 \n4.2. A comparison of the vegetation of the Late Miocene and the Pliocene 706 \nExamining trends in vegetation patterns of a warmer world, the Tortonian reconstruction presented 707 \nhere is compared with the vegetation of the Piacenzian (3.6-2.6 Ma), created using the same 708 \nmethodology (Salzmann et al., 2008). Both reconstructions show boreal forests migrating towards 709 \nthe poles, followed by temperate forests and grasslands. The spread of warm-temperate evergreen 710 \nmixed forests in Europe and southeast Asia are evident in both reconstructions, though this biome 711 \nspreads more in North America in the Late Miocene than in the Piacenzian. Both reconstructions 712 \nshow a reduction in the extent of the Sahara Desert, though more-so in the Late Miocene. Both 713 \nreconstructions show an opening up of the tropical forest in South America when compared to 714 \npresent day potential vegetation. In temperate South America however the reconstructions differ, 715 \nwith the Late Miocene having drier conditions than those of the Piacenzian. In tropical Africa the 716 \n30 \n \nbiome distribution is comparable with slightly more tropical evergreen broadleaved forest in the 717 \nTortonian. Below the equator, the Piacenzian reconstruction benefits from better data coverage and 718 \nthus the reconstructed biomes differ. Similar biomes are predicted in both reconstructions for Asia 719 \nbehind the Himalayan Front. In the Piacenzian a mixture of temperate grasslands, temperate 720 \nxerophytic shrubland and temperate forests existed, whilst in the Tortonian temperate savanna 721 \ndominates with patches of temperate forests and temperate xerophytic shrublands. South of the 722 \nHimalayan Front, both reconstructions show a mixture of warm-temperate forest, tropical forests 723 \nand tropical savanna in Southeast Asia. In Australia both reconstructions show much wetter 724 \nvegetation than that of the present-day potential vegetation; the main difference is where the 725 \nwoodland and forest biomes are distributed. In the Piacenzian forests woodland and savanna are 726 \ndistributed in the east of the continent, whereas in the Tortonian a large area of temperate 727 \nschlerophyll woodland and shrubland is present across the south of the continent (Salzmann et al., 728 \n2008). 729 \nBoth reconstructions, despite the difference in age, show similar patterns of biome changes relating 730 \nto both being warmer worlds than present. The reconstructions show a spread of boreal forests 731 \npolewards followed by temperate biomes. Both show an expansion of warm-temperate forests with 732 \nsubtropical taxa in the temperate realms of Eurasia and both show a reduction of deserts. Different 733 \ncontinental configuration, orography and ice-sheet extent are most likely to account for differences 734 \nbetween the two reconstructions. These broad patterns are also seen in future GCM simulations 735 \n(Salzmann et al., 2009). 736 \n 737 \n4.3. Comparison to previously published Tortonian vegetation reconstructions 738 \nThe Tortonian reconstruction presented here, using a 27 biome classification of 240 palaeoecological 739 \nsites and a state-of-the-art AGCM shows similarities and differences to previously published 740 \n31 \n \nTortonian vegetation reconstructions (Fran\u00e7ois et al., 2006; Micheels et al., 2007). Both of these 741 \nstudies used an AGCM with a resolution of 3.75\u00b0x3.75\u00b0. In Fran\u00e7ois et al. (2006) a modern 742 \npalaeogeography was populated with vegetation based on an unpublished palaeobotanical database 743 \nand predicted vegetation from BIOME1 (Prentice et al., 1992). This 14 biome reconstruction shows 744 \nthe same spread of boreal forests in the high latitudes. However in North America, Iceland, and east 745 \nEurasia, the boreal forests extended southwards into regions with palaeoecological data showing the 746 \npresence of other biomes (Fig. 6). In the temperate region both the reconstructions presented here, 747 \nand that of Fran\u00e7ois et al. (2006), indicate a spread of warm-temperate evergreen mixed forests 748 \n[temperate broadleaved evergreen forest in Fran\u00e7ois et al. (2006)] in Europe and the eastern USA. 749 \nFor the rest of North America, the Tortonian reconstructions differ, with palaeobotanical evidence 750 \nsuggesting temperate savanna where Fran\u00e7ois et al., (2006) predicted tropical seasonal forest and 751 \ntemperate forests (Fig. 6). In Eurasia, both reconstructions predict a patchwork of vegetation on the 752 \nHimalayan Plateau, Fran\u00e7ois et al., (2006) predicted grassland, semi-desert and minor savanna 753 \nleading directly into boreal forests at ca. 45\u00b0N. The reconstruction herein (Fig. 6) shows 754 \npredominantly temperate savanna with minor areas of temperate xerophytic shrubland, temperate 755 \ndeciduous broadleaved forest and temperate evergreen needleleaf forest. This then changed to 756 \ntemperate grassland at 45\u00b0N before a transition to boreal forest at ca. 55\u00b0N. In South America, the 757 \nreconstruction of Fran\u00e7ois et al. (2006) predicted tropical rain forest extending into the temperate 758 \nrealm to about 40\u00b0S and a tropical seasonal forest occupying the Atacama Desert. The 759 \npalaeoecological evidence presented here indicates that the temperate zone of South America was a 760 \nmixture of temperate xerophytic shrubland and tropical savanna with a reduced Atacama Desert 761 \n(Fig. 6). These discrepancies in South America may relate to differences in geography, because a 762 \nseaway was present in much of modern Argentina (Fig. 6). Differences also occurred in tropical 763 \nSouth America where palaeobotanical evidence suggests an opening up of the modern rainforest to 764 \ncreate an area of tropical savanna, whereas Fran\u00e7ois et al. (2006) presented an extensive area of 765 \ntropical forest. In Africa, the reconstructions appear comparable except in the Sahara where BIOME4 766 \n32 \n \npredicts small areas of desert and in southern Africa where BIOME4 predicts a mixture of tropical 767 \nsavanna and tropical xerophytic shrubland. Again the reconstructions compare favourably in 768 \nsoutheast Asia, both predicting tropical forests. On Australia the reconstructions differ again though 769 \nthis may be more related to different classification schemes; as temperate schlerophyll woodland 770 \nand shrubland is not represented in the scheme used by Fran\u00e7ois et al. (2006). Overall, some of the 771 \ndifferences between the reconstruction of Fran\u00e7ois et al. (2006) and the one presented here may be 772 \nrelated to differences in CO2, geography and the use of a smaller number of biomes. 773 \nThe reconstruction of Micheels et al., (2007) is again on a modern land-sea mask, and was based on 774 \na 36 site proxy dataset (Micheels, 2003) translated into 13 biomes. Comparing the reconstruction 775 \npresented here and that of Micheels et al. (2007) there are similarities in the poleward shift of 776 \nboreal forests. However in Micheels et al., (2007), the boreal forest consistently changed into cool 777 \nconifer forests; in the reconstruction here this is only observed in Alaska (Fig. 6). Continuing into the 778 \ntemperate realms, the two reconstructions differ significantly in North America. In the west, 779 \npalaeobotanical data indicate warm-temperate mixed forests at a slightly higher latitude than 780 \nreconstructed in Micheels et al. (2007). At the latitude of the warm mixed forest of Micheels et al. 781 \n(2007), palaeobotanical data show the presence of coastal warm-temperate mixed forest but 782 \ntemperate xerophytic shrubland further inland (Fig. 6); these differences may be related to spatial 783 \nresolution. In the central USA, palaeobotany provides evidence of temperate savanna mixed with 784 \nBIOME4-predicted temperate needleleaf forests; in Micheels et al. (2007) this region is completely 785 \nforested. The eastern coast of the USA compares favourably in both reconstructions. 786 \nThe Iberian Peninsula in this reconstruction shows a higher vegetational diversity than in Micheels et 787 \nal. (2007) (Fig. 6). Moving east across Europe, both reconstructions are comparable, although the 788 \nreconstruction presented here has a greater expanse of warm-temperate forest. This forest 789 \noccupied significantly less area in southeast Asia; this is comparable to the reconstruction of 790 \nMicheels et al. (2007). On the Himalayan Plateau and north of it, the reconstruction herein shows 791 \n33 \n \nmore vegetational variation, this is due to using a larger biome scheme. The reconstruction of 792 \nMicheels et al. (2007) also presented a polar desert on the Tibetan Plateau, which is not recognised 793 \nhere. 794 \nThe most significant difference between the Tortonian reconstruction herein (Fig. 6) and the 795 \nreconstruction of Micheels et al. (2007) is in South America and Australia. In South America, the 796 \nreconstruction of Micheels et al. (2007) shows latitudinal bands of tropical rain forest, tropical 797 \nseasonal forest and warm mixed forest to 23.5\u00b0S, whereas palaeobotanical data shows tropical 798 \nsavanna separating areas of tropical forest (Fig. 6). In temperate South America, the reconstructions 799 \ndiffer mainly in the absence of the Atacama Desert in Micheels et al. (2007), whereas 800 \nsedimentological evidence shows that it was present (Alonso et al., 1991; Clarke, 2006). In Australia, 801 \nMicheels et al. (2007) interpreted vegetation in longitudinal bands becoming more humid to the 802 \nnortheast. In the present reconstruction, the palaeobotanical data show a dominance of temperate 803 \nschlerophyll woodland and shrubland along the south of the continent and the predictions of 804 \nBIOME4 indicate that the vegetation became moister to the southeast (Fig. 6). 805 \nIn Africa, the present reconstruction and that of Micheels et al. (2007) are comparable. The 806 \nvegetation distributions differ mainly in the areas predicted by BIOME4 in the reconstruction 807 \npresented herein. Micheels et al. (2007) reconstructed the Tortonian Sahara as a mixture of warm 808 \ngrassland and savanna. In this reconstruction, BIOME4 predicts most of the Sahara Desert to be 809 \ntropical xerophytic shrubland with isolated areas of desert (Fig. 6). BIOME4 also predicts a mixture of 810 \nsavanna and xerophytic shrubland in southern Africa (Fig.6); in the reconstruction of Micheels et al., 811 \n(2007) savanna changed to warm mixed forest towards the Cape. The differences between the 812 \npresent reconstruction and that of Micheels et al. (2007) could be related to the use of a Tortonian 813 \nland-sea mask and a larger palaeoecological data set in the study presented here. 814 \nThis study has refined previous Tortonian vegetation reconstructions. Previous work used limited 815 \npalaeoecological data which was not cited (Fran\u00e7ois et al., 2006; Micheels et al., 2007). Here we 816 \n34 \n \npresent a 240 point palaeobotanical and vertebrate-based data set for the Tortonian in a format 817 \nwhich is readily compatible with a state-of-the-art mechanistic vegetation model. This allows it to be 818 \neasily used for data-model comparisons, and permits it to be used as a boundary condition in future 819 \nmodelling studies. The methodology used to generate the global vegetation reconstruction also uses 820 \na novel approach, previously only applied to the Piacenzian (Salzmann et al. 2008). The 240 point 821 \npalaeoecological data set has been merged with a \u201cbest-fit\u201d Tortonian model generated biome 822 \ndistribution map. This has meant that areas lacking palaeoecological data have been filled with 823 \nvegetation that most closely suits the climate that fits best with regions with a large amount of 824 \npalaeoecological data. This is instead of inferring biome distribution or filling gaps with modern 825 \nvegetation. Hence an advanced Tortonian biome distribution map has been constructed, which will 826 \nbe used in future modelling studies. 827 \n 828 \n4.4 Tortonian vegetation, climate and CO2 levels 829 \nThe distribution of Tortonian biomes, reconstructed using palaeoecological data and model-830 \npredicted vegetation shows evidence for a warmer world than at present (Fig. 6). This is also 831 \nsupported by estimates of climate from palaeobotanical data presented in Table 2. The AGCM-832 \ngenerated temperature difference with the pre-industrial in Fig. 7A, shows that the warming of the 833 \nTortonian relative to pre-industrial was a global phenomenon. Exceptions to this are due to 834 \ndifferences in the land-sea distribution. This global warming requires a forcing agent that can 835 \noperate at all latitudes, an increase in CO2 relative to the pre-industrial would be the most likely 836 \ncause. This is not the only study that has shown these changes in the vegetation during the 837 \nTortonian relate to a warmer world (Fran\u00e7ois et al., 2006; Micheels et al., 2007). However estimates 838 \nof CO2 levels for the Tortonian are between the Last Glacial Maximum and mid 20\nth Century 839 \nconcentrations (K\u00fcrschner et al., 1996, 2008; Berner and Kothavala, 2001; Pearson and Palmer, 840 \n2004; Pagani et al., 2005; Tripati et al., 2009). This has led to the suggestion that Tortonian climate 841 \n35 \n \nwas decoupled from CO2 (Shevenell et al., 2004; Pagani et al., 2005; Mosbrugger et al., 2005). 842 \nHowever recent work by Tripati et al. (2009) has shown that climate is highly sensitive to \u03c1CO2 and 843 \nfor the last 20 Ma major climatic changes were synchronous with changes in \u03c1CO2. Ruddiman (2010) 844 \nrecently suggested that one of the possibilities for apparent low CO2 levels over the past 22 Ma, 845 \nwhilst climate has fluctuated considerably, could be the incorrect calculation of CO2 from proxies. 846 \nRecently CO2 estimates for the Pliocene have been recalculated using the alkenone proxy, which 847 \nplaced atmospheric CO2 levels for 4.5 Ma at between 370-420 ppmv (Pagani et al., 2010). Previous 848 \nalkenone estimates for the latest Miocene (5.37Ma) range from 247-340 ppmv (Pagani et al., 2005). 849 \nTaking the upper estimates for both alkenone records requires an increase in atmospheric CO2 of 80 850 \nppmv across the Miocene-Pliocene boundary. Whilst using the lower estimates requires an increase 851 \nof 123 ppmv over a period of 0.87 Ma, this is not compatible with other estimates of CO2 levels 852 \n(K\u00fcrschner et al., 1996; Pearson and Palmer, 2000). Although current estimates of CO2 for the 853 \nTortonian do not match the warming relative to pre-industrial seen in the palaeoecological data, it 854 \nwould appear to be the most likely driving force for a global increase in MAT. 855 \n 856 \n5. Conclusions 857 \n 858 \nOur Tortonian vegetation reconstruction created using palaeoecological data and a mechanistic 859 \nvegetation model forced by HadAM3 shows that this interval was warmer and wetter than present. 860 \nThe Tortonian vegetation distribution shows significant differences to the modern. Such as a spread 861 \nof boreal forests and temperate biomes too much higher latitudes than today. The expansion of 862 \nwarm-temperate evergreen mixed forests in Europe, southeast Asia and parts of North America. The 863 \nreplacement of arid desert regions by shrubland, grasslands, savanna and woodland. An expansion 864 \nof temperate savanna in Central USA, the Middle East and on and north of the Himalayan Plateau. 865 \n36 \n \nThis comprehensive dataset for the Tortonian will be used both to assess future palaeoclimate 866 \nmodelling studies and as a land cover mask to initialise future Tortonian experiments. It is hoped this 867 \nwill be the starting point for a more detailed understanding of the Late Miocene using a combined 868 \ndata-model methodology. 869 \nThe level and nature of warming (\u0394+4.5\u00b0C compared to pre-industrial) reconstructed by our 870 \npalaeoecological data and modelling study requires a climatic forcing mechanism operating on a 871 \nglobal scale (i.e. CO2). However, published Tortonian atmospheric CO2 levels from a variety of 872 \nproxies range between the Last Glacial Maximum, pre-industrial and mid-20th Century levels. Before 873 \nMiocene climate is assumed to be decoupled from atmospheric CO2, it is first necessary to reconcile 874 \nthis miss-match between terrestrial proxy and climate model evidence with available techniques 875 \nused to reconstruct palaeo-atmospheric CO2. 876 \n 877 \nAcknowledgements 878 \nThis work forms part of the first author\u2019s PhD funded by the Natural Environment Research Council 879 \n(UK) and the British Geological Survey University Funding Initiative (PhD studentship 880 \nNE\/G523563\/1).
