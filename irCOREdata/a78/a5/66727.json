[DOI: 10.1063\/1.1776621]\nElectroluminescence (EL) in organic materials is now\nthe subject of intense worldwide research. For balanced\ncharge injection, multilayer structures, for example incor-\nporating both electron and hole transporting materials, are\noften fabricated.1 As an alternative, single-layer organic\nlight-emitting devices (OLEDs) using blends of conjugated\npolymers and carrier transport materials have been inves-\ntigated.2\u20134 Such devices have the advantage of easy manu-\nfacturing in terms of a single-spin-coating process. We have\npreviously reported on single-layer OLEDs using blends\nof poly[2-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-5-methoxy-1,4-phenylene-\nvinylene] (MEH-PPV) with electron transport materials con-\ntaining both oxadiazole and pyridine units.5,6 In this work, an\nelectron transport material, 2,7-bis[2-(4-tert-butyl-\nphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-5-yl]-9,9-dihexylfluorene (DFD) has\nbeen blended with MEH-PPV. This compound contains both\noxadiazole and fluorene units; oxadiazole to confer electron\ninjection, and the fluorene unit to provide blue emission.\nMEH-PPV was purchased from the Aldrich Chemical\nCo. while DFD was synthesized in Durham, U.K. Its\nchemical structure and synthesis are depicted in Scheme 1.\nIndium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass from Merck with\nsheet resistance of 15 V h\u22121 was used as the anode. ITO\nwas patterned into 2 mm wide stripes by etching in\nHCl:HNO3:H2Os1:0.08:1d solution at 50\u00b0C. This substrate\nwas cleaned by ultrasonification in acetone and isopropyl\nalcohol for 30 min each and dried with a nitrogen gun. The\npolymer and electron transport compound were dissolved in\nchloroform to provide the blend solution, which was spin\ncoated onto the patterned substrate. In our experiments, the\nconcentration of DFD was changed from 20% to 95% of the\ntotal weight. The thickness of the blend film was set to\n120 nm by adjusting the concentration of the solution and\nthe spin speed. Following the spin coating, 1.5 mm wide Al\nstripes (thickness 150 nm) were thermally evaporated per-\npendicular to the ITO stripes at a pressure of about\n10\u22126 mbar. In some cases, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)\ndoped with polystyrene sulphonic acid [PEDOT:PSS), pur-\nchased from Bayer AG] was spin coated onto the substrate\nprior to the deposition of the polymer blend. These PEDOT\nlayers (120 nm in thickness) were dried for 12 h. in\n10\u22121 mbar vacuum at room temperature to remove residual\nsolvent.\nElectrical measurements were undertaken at room tem-\nperature with the OLED devices in a vacuum chamber\ns10\u22121 mbard using instrumentation reported previously.5,6 For\nabsorption and photoluminescence (PL) measurements, the\nblend films were spin coated onto glass substrates. Absorp-\ntion and PL spectra were measured with a Perkin Elmer\nLambda 19 ultraviolet\/visible\/mean-IR spectrometer and a\nFluoromax-3 spectrometer, respectively.\nThe current versus voltage sI\u2013Vd and light output versus\nvoltage sL\u2013Vd characteristics of ITO\/polymer blend\/Al\nOLEDs are shown in Fig. 1 (positive bias applied to the ITO\nelectrode). The I\u2013V and L\u2013V characteristics of an OLED\nbased on a pure (nonblended) MEH-PPV layer are also\nshown for reference. It is evident that the current at a par-\nticular value of voltage decreased as the concentration of\nDFD was increased. Figure 1 also reveals that the light out-\nput from the blended OLEDs increased as the percentage of\nDFD in the blended layer increased from 20% to 70%, but\ndecreased for higher concentrations of the electron transport\ncompound. At 25 V, the light emission of the 70% DFD\nstructure was eight times that of a pure MEH-PPV device at\nthe same voltage. The brightness of this 70% device was\n280 cd m\u22122 at a current density of 66 mA cm\u22122. The increase\nof the light output over most of the composition range of the\nblended layer devices indicates an increase in the injection of\nelectrons. The reason for the reduction in the light output for\nblends containing higher concentrations of DFD is not clear\nat present; the phenomenon is perhaps related to a decreasing\nhole current for blends consisting predominantly of the\nelectron-transport compound.\nThe external quantum efficiencies of the blended layer\nOLEDs are shown in Fig. 2. These efficiencies increased\nwith the concentration of DFD over the range of compo-\nsition investigated. The device fabricated with a 95%\nblend was about 100 times more efficient than that of purea)Electronic mail: m.c.petty@durham.ac.uk\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS VOLUME 85, NUMBER 7 16 AUGUST 2004\n0003-6951\/2004\/85(7)\/1283\/3\/$20.00 \u00a9 2004 American Institute of Physics1283\nDownloaded 21 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.66.

In our work, no\nsign of phase separation was evident using atomic force\nmicroscopy, although this is not a definitive method of de-\ntermining the distribution of the two components. A \u201cdilu-\ntion\u201d effect may be a contributory factor for the increase\nin our OLED efficiencies with increasing DFD concentra-\ntion. As the polymer molecules become separated by the\nelectron transporting molecules, concentration quenching\u2014\nintermolecular nonradiative decay of singlet excitons\u2014will\nbe reduced resulting in an enhanced light output. Kang et al.4\npreviously noted that the external quantum efficiency in-\ncreased over seven times when MEH-PPV was blended with\n90 wt% poly(methyl methacrylate), an electro-optically inert\nmaterial. However, a much larger increase in efficiency (al-\nmost 500 times) was noted by mixing the MEH-PPV with\nanother electroactive polymer.\nFigure 3 shows the absorption spectra of DFD, MEH-\nPPV, and 90% DFD blend films and the PL spectra of DFD\nand 90% blend films. For the PL measurements, both the\nDFD and the 90% blend films were excited at 350 nm, the\nwavelength at which the absorption in the DFD is a maxi-\nmum while the absorption in MEH-PPV is low. The absorp-\ntion spectrum of the blend film has features attributable to\nboth the DFD and MEH-PPV. The emission spectrum of the\nDFD overlaps to some extent with the absorption spectrum\nof the MEH-PPV, a necessary condition for efficient energy\ntransfer between two materials.8 The electron transporting\nmaterial used in our study is itself a blue emitter (Fig. 3).\nHowever, no emission from the DFD was evident for the\nOLED containing the 90% blend. This again, suggests that\nthe DFD and MEH-PPV materials are very well mixed in the\nblended film.\nThe results of the PL experiments are reflected in the\nelectroluminescent output of the OLEDs. Figure 4 shows the\nEL spectra of OLEDs using pure MEH-PPV, 50% and 90%\nDFD blend films. The EL spectra of OLEDs using blend\nfilms were very similar to the spectrum obtained from a pure\nMEH-PPV film. Emission from the DFD was not detected\neven at a high DFD concentration of 95%.\nWe have compared the highest occupied molecular\norbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital\n(LUMO) energies for MEH-PPV and DFD using the semi-\nempirical PM3 method, where a ten-repeat-unit oligomer\nFIG. 1.

Thus, holes are more likely to be transferred from\nthe ITO electrode to the MEH-PPV but electrons will move\nfrom the Al cathode to the DFD. This provides an alternative\nand, perhaps more likely, explanation for our results than the\nenergy transfer mechanism indicated above. For example,\nthe excited MEH-PPV state can be formed by electron trans-\nfer from the DFD to the MEH-PPV. The relatively large dif-\nference in the HOMO levels of the MEH-PPV and DFD also\nexplains the I\u2013V data shown in Fig. 1(a). As DFD concen-\ntration in the blended film increases, it will become more\ndifficult to inject holes (the majority carriers) from the ITO\ninto the blended film.\nWe have also undertaken preliminary work to improve\nfurther the characteristics of our blended layer devices (a)\nby incorporating a hole transport layer, PEDOT:PSS, be-\ntween the ITO anode and the blended film and (b) by ther-\nmally annealing the devices. In this first case, the current and\nlight output versus voltage behavior of OLEDs incorporating\nPEDOT as a function of DFD concentration was similar with\nthose of OLEDs without the PEDOT layer (data not shown).\nHowever, the external quantum efficiency of OLEDs with\nthe PEDOT layer were all increased by about a factor of 3,\nregardless of the concentration of DFD, giving a maximum\nexternal quantum efficiency for the OLED containing 95%\nDFD of 0.3%.\nFor our annealing experiments, we heat treated the\nOLEDs, following the Al deposition, at 160\u00b0C for 1 h in a\nvacuum of about 10\u22124 mbar. In the case of the OLED fabri-\ncated with a pure MEH-PPV film, the external quantum ef-\nficiency increased by a factor of 20 after thermal annealing,\nconsistent with our previous studies and those of other\nworkers.5,10,11 However, this efficiency improvement became\nless as the concentration of DFD was increased. For OLEDs\ncontaining more than 60% of the electron transport com-\npound, the quantum efficiency of the devices was reduced\nafter the heat treatment. These effects, which may be the\nresult of some phase separation\/crystallization of DFD in\nthe blended layer OLEDs,12,13 are currently the subject of\nfurther investigation.\nIn conclusion, single-layer OLEDs using blended films\nof MEH-PPV and an electron transport material, DFD, have\nbeen investigated. The external quantum efficiencies of the\ndevices containing the electron transport compound in-\ncreased significantly over those obtained for devices using\npure MEH-PPV. The results argue well for the development\nof high efficiency OLEDs based on blended layers. However,\nfurther work is needed on the various processing steps in\norder to produce fully optimized devices.\nThis work was supported by the Postdoctoral Fellow-\nship Program of Korea Science and Engineering Foundation\n(KOSEF) (for one of the authors J.H.A.) and by Durham\nCounty Council under the Science and Technology for Busi-\nness and Enterprise Programme SP\/082.\n1T.
