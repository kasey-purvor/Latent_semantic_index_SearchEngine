INTRODUCTION\nIn this paper we examine the relationship between board size and firm performance\nfor UK firms. Corporate boards of directors play a central role in the corporate\ngovernance of modern companies, and hence understanding this relationship is very\nimportant to our understanding of corporate governance. Much of the public debate on\nboard structure has centered on pressure for smaller board size. It is argued that\nalthough larger board size initially facilitates key board functions, there comes a point\nwhen larger boards suffer from coordination and communication problems and hence\nboard effectiveness (and firm performance) declines (Lipton and Lorsch, 1992; and\nJensen, 1993). The empirical evidence (reviewed below) appears to support this view,\nwith a majority of studies documenting a significantly negative relation between board\nsize and corporate performance. If larger board size indeed \u201ccauses\u201d worse\nperformance, then larger boards would represent inefficient governance that could\npossibly be improved by a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to board size. For example,\ninfluential scholars have argued that board size should be no greater than 8 or 9 (Lipton\nand Lorsch, 1992; and Jensen, 1993) for all firms. Hence the findings have important\nregulatory implications.1\nHowever, this interpretation is by no means universally held. A number of recent\npapers (Lehn et al., 2004; Boone et al., 2007; Coles et al., 2008; Guest, 2008; and Linck\net al., 2008) show that board size is determined by firm specific variables, such as\nTobin\u2019s Q, profitability and firm size. Since firm performance has a negative impact on\nboard size, previous studies have been heavily criticized for not adequately controlling\nfor endogeneity problems (Wintoki, 2007). To address this, Wintoki (2007) employs a\ngeneralized method of moments (GMM) estimator that allows board size to adjust to\n3past performance, and finds no relationship between board size and firm performance.\nAdditionally, since board size is determined by firm specific characteristics, the impact\nof board size on performance may differ according to these characteristics. Consistent\nwith this, Coles et al. (2008) find that the impact of board size on firm value is positive\nfor large firms, and hence large board size may be an optimal value maximising\noutcome for such firms.\nThe relationship between board size and performance may differ not just by firm\nspecific characteristics but also by national institutional characteristics. In countries\nwith different institutional backgrounds, the functions of boards are different, and\ntherefore the expected board size - performance relation may be expected to differ.\nTherefore examination of other countries is useful in more fully understanding the\nrelation between board size and performance. The few non-US empirical studies to date\nemploy either relatively small or cross-sectional samples, and consequently, we have\nrelatively little large sample non-US evidence.\nIn this paper, we contribute to the predominantly US based literature by examining\nthe relation between board size and performance for a large sample of UK firms (2,746)\nover a long time period (1981-2002), and employ the largest sample to date (over\n25,000 firm year observations). The large and long panel dataset ensures that our results\nare less likely to be biased by the particular time period under investigation and allows\nus to employ appropriate econometric methods to control for endogeneity. We\nincorporate the implications of the above recent findings into our analysis, such as\nwhether the performance impacts of board size depend on other characteristics that\ndetermine board size. The specific institutional context of the UK is interesting because\nUK boards arguably play a much weaker monitoring role than US firms (Guest, 2008).\n4As a result, any negative effect of large board size is more likely to reflect problems in\ncarrying out the advisory role rather than the monitoring role. Thus by providing large\nsample evidence on this country, we allow the US results to be placed in a broader\ncontext.\nOur main findings are as follows: We find strong evidence of a negative relation\nbetween board size and three different firm performance measures (profitability,\nTobin\u2019s Q, and share returns). This basic result proves robust to a variety of regression\nmodels. We employ fixed effect models to control for unobserved variables and,\nfollowing Wintoki (2007), a generalized method of moments estimator which allows\nboard size and performance to be jointly determined and allows board size to adjust to\nprevious changes in firm performance. The optimal board size depends on the\nperformance measure employed, although it is less than ten members across all\nmeasures. Decomposing board size into the number of outside and inside directors, we\nfind that both have a negative impact, although for the latter this is not significantly so\nfor every performance measure. We find no evidence that firm characteristics that\ndetermine board size in the UK lead to a more positive board size \u2013 firm performance\nrelation. In contrast, we find that the negative board size \u2013 performance relation is\nstrongest for large firms, which have larger boards.\nThe paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides a review of the literature on board\nsize and performance. Section 3 describes the institutional context of the UK. Section 4\ndescribes the data. Section 5 presents the empirical results. Section 6 concludes.\n52. THE EFFECT OF BOARD SIZE ON COMPANY PERFORMANCE:\nREVIEW OF THE LITERATURE\nThe two most important functions of the board of directors are those of advising and\nmonitoring (Raheja, 2005; and Adams and Ferriera, 2007). The advisory function\ninvolves the provision of expert advice to the CEO and access to critical information\nand resources (Fama and Jensen, 1983). This is performed by both insiders and\noutsiders, although Fama and Jensen (1983) note the importance of outside directors,\nwho bring valuable expertise and potentially important connections. The advantage of\nlarger board size is the greater collective information that the board subsequently\npossesses and hence larger boards will lead to higher performance (Dalton et al., 1999,\n2005). Secondly, the board has the responsibility to monitor, discipline, and remove\nineffective management teams, to ensure that managers pursue the interests of\nshareholders. Raheja (2005) argues that insiders are an important source of firm-specific\ninformation for the board, but may have distorted objectives due to private benefits and\nlack of independence from the CEO. Compared to insiders, outsiders are more\nindependent, providing better monitoring, but are less informed about the firm\u2019s\nactivities. Again, the advantage of larger board size and an increasing number of non-\nexecutive directors is the greater collective information possessed by the board which is\nalso valuable for the monitoring function (Lehn et al., 2004). Therefore, both functions\npredict an initial improvement in board performance as board size increases, and\nincreases in the number of non-executives are expected to have a more positive impact\nthan increases in the number of executive directors.\nHowever, there are eventually disadvantages of large boards in the form of\ncoordination costs and free rider problems. Firstly, coordination and communication\n6problems arise because it is more difficult to arrange board meetings, reach consensus,\nleading to slower and less-efficient decision-making (Jensen 1993). Secondly, board\ncohesiveness is undermined because board members will be less likely to share a\ncommon purpose, communicate with each other clearly, and reach a consensus that\nbuilds on the directors\u2019 different points of view (Lipton and Lorsch, 1992). Thirdly,\ndirector free-riding increases because the cost to any individual director of not\nexercising diligence falls in proportion to board size (Lipton and Lorsch, 1992). Jensen\n(1993) and Lipton and Lorsch (1992) suggest that as board size increases beyond a\ncertain point, these inefficiencies outweigh the initial advantages from having more\ndirectors to draw on, leading to a lower level of corporate performance. Lipton and\nLorsch (1992) argue that a board size of eight or nine directors is optimal, whilst Jensen\n(1993) argues that the optimum board size should be around seven or eight directors.\nThe key findings of existing empirical studies are reported in Table 1 below. The\nmajority of US empirical studies have documented a negative relationship between\nboard size and firm performance, leading Hermalin and Weisbach (2003) to conclude\nthat this relation is one of the prominent empirical regularities in the literature. Using\ndata from 452 large U.S. industrial corporations between 1984 and 1991, Yermack\n(1996) documents a negative relationship between board size and firm performance, as\nmeasured by Tobin\u2019s Q and profitability. Other US studies have found very similar\nresults (Huther, 1997; Cheng et al., 2007; Coles et al., 2008). Only two US studies\n(Adams and Mehran, 2005; Dalton et al., 1999 (meta analysis study not reported in\nTable 1)) finds a positive effect of board size on performance. 2\nINSERT TABLE 1 HERE\n7Evidence from other countries is broadly consistent but less robust. Eisenberg et al.\n(1998) provide evidence that the negative relationship between board size and firm\nperformance holds for small private firms in Finland. For Switzerland, Loderer and\nPeyer (2002) find a significantly negative impact on Tobin\u2019s Q (although not on\nprofitability) whilst Beiner et al. (2004 and 2006) find no negative impact. For\nMalaysian firms, both Mak and Kusnadi (2005) and Haniffa and Hudaib (2006) find a\nsignificantly negative impact of board size on Tobin\u2019s Q. Bozec (2005) finds that board\nsize has a significantly negative effect on sales margin but not profitability for 25 large\nCanadian firms. For the UK, Conyon and Peck (1998) examine 481 listed UK firms for\n1992-1995 and find a significantly negative effect of board size on both market to book\nvalue and profitability, whilst Lasfer (2004) finds a significantly negative impact on\nTobin\u2019s Q.\nAs Wintoki (2007) points out, a significant problem in examining the impact of\nboard size on performance is that of endogeneity. Firstly, unobserved heterogeneity can\narise if both firm performance and board size are jointly determined by an unobservable\nfirm specific variable. One way to address this concern is with a firm fixed effects\nmodel. Yermack (1996) employs such a model and finds that the negative impact of\nboard size still holds. Secondly, board size may be determined simultaneously with firm\nperformance in any given period (simultaneous endogeneity) or may be determined by\npast performance (dynamic endogeneity). Previous studies have attempted to overcome\nthese problems by employing instrumental variable techniques (Eisenberg et al., 1998;\nPostma et al., 2003; Adams and Mehran, 2005; de Andres et al., 2005; Beiner et al.,\n2006; and Bennedsen et al., 2008), and as shown in Table 1, the results suggest that\nthere is causality from board size to performance. However, although instrumental\n8variable regressions potentially eliminate endogeneity, they require the identification of\nstrictly exogenous instrumental variables which is almost impossible in a corporate\ngovernance setting (Wintoki, 2007).\nTherefore both methods can lead to biased results if board size and performance are\njointly determined by unobservable variables and board size adjusts to past\nperformance. Wintoki (2007) argues that an appropriate model to employ is the GMM\nestimator (Arrellanno and Bond, 1991), which eliminates these sources of endogeneity.\nWhen using this model, Wintoki (2007) no longer finds a negative relationship between\nboard size and performance. The only other study to employ this method is Conyon and\nPeck (1998) who in contrast, do find a negative impact of board size on performance.\nTherefore although the GMM method appears a very appropriate model to employ, the\nevidence is mixed on whether board size has a negative impact on performance when\nthis model is used.\nA number of recent empirical papers (Lehn et al., 2004; Boone et al., 2007; Coles et\nal., 2008; Guest, 2008; and Linck et al., 2008) have examined the determinants of board\nsize. Board size is expected to be greater when the need for information and hence\nboard advice is high. Such needs are expected to increase with firm scale and\ncomplexity. All the above studies find that board size is positively related to firm size.\nA number of proxies are used to measure complexity and are shown to positively\ninfluence board size, including financial leverage (Coles et al., 2008; Guest, 2008; and\nLinck et al., 2008), firm age (Boone et al., 2007; Coles et al., 2008; Guest, 2008; and\nLinck et al., 2008), and industrial diversification (Boone et al., 2007; Coles et al., 2008;\nand Linck et al., 2008). These studies provide strong evidence that board size is\ninfluenced by firm specific variables, which appear consistent with value maximising\n9motives. These findings suggest that the impact of board size on performance may\ndiffer for different types of firms. Coles et al., (2008) indeed find evidence that larger\nfirms, diversified firms, and firms that rely more on debt financing, will derive greater\nfirm value from having larger boards.\n3. THE EFFECT OF BOARD SIZE ON FIRM PERFORMANCE: THE UK\nINSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT\nThe impact of board size on performance may be expected to differ not just\naccording to firm specific characteristics but also by country, since the role and function\nof boards may differ by country. The potential problems of large boards will depend on\nthe specific functions and effectiveness of boards and this will differ according to the\ninstitutional and legal environment. In the context of this study, it has been argued that\nUK boards play a much weaker monitoring role than US boards (see e.g., Guest (2008)\nfor a more detailed discussion).\nThe prescribed advisory and monitoring functions of UK boards are very similar to\nthose of US boards (Cadbury, 1992). However, there are several reasons why the\nmonitoring function will be carried out less effectively in the UK. Firstly, UK outside\ndirectors are rarely held legally accountable for failing to fulfill their legal duty of care\nand loyalty, and consequently they regard their role as being primarily that of advising\nrather than monitoring (Franks et al., 2001). Secondly, UK boards have historically\nconsisted of a lower proportion of outside directors who are less independent from\nmanagement (e.g., Cosh and Hughes, 1987).3 Thirdly, the financial incentives\n(shareholding and remuneration) for outside directors in the UK to fulfill their functions\nare lower (Cosh and Hughes, 1987; and Higgs, 2003).\n10\nThe relative strength of other substitute governance mechanisms is stronger in the\nUK and this further weakens the monitoring role played by outside directors (Agrawal\nand Knoeber, 1996). Firstly, UK companies have less available takeover defences and\nconsequently the market for corporate control should perform a stronger function (Short\nand Keasey, 1999). Secondly, British institutional investors are more active monitors,\nable to act collectively (Crespi-Cladera and Renneboog, 2003), and expected to perform\na stronger role because ownership concentration is higher (Short and Keasey, 1999).\nThe idea that UK boards play a weaker monitoring role than their US counterparts is\nsupported by the UK empirical evidence on the determinants and effects of board\nstructure. In contrast to US findings, UK board size and structure is not determined by\nthe costs and benefits of monitoring, although it is determined by advisory needs\n(Guest, 2008). The proportion of outside directors does not have a positive impact on\ngeneral firm performance (Vafeas and Theodorou, 1998), or on specific monitoring\ntasks, such as CEO turnover (Cosh and Hughes, 1997; and Franks et al., 2001).4 In the\nUS, by contrast, although outsider proportion does not have a positive impact on overall\nperformance, it does have a positive impact on specific tasks (Hermalin and Weisbach,\n2003).\nSince UK boards only play a weak monitoring role, their monitoring effectiveness is\nmuch less likely to depend on board size. However, UK boards do play an important\nadvisory function, and we therefore expect any negative relation between board size and\nperformance to be driven by problems associated with the advisory function. We expect\nany negative relation to be weaker than in the US, where the detrimental effect of large\nboard size is arguably the result of boards becoming less effective at both the advisory\nand monitoring functions.\n11\n4. DATA\nThe source for our sample of UK publicly quoted firms is Datastream, from which both\ncompany board size and all financial variables are derived. Datastream reports both the\ntotal number of (executive and non-executive) directors on the board and the number of\nnon-executive directors on the board. Non-executive directors are those that are neither\ninsiders nor officers of the firm, in contrast to executive directors. We restrict our\nsample to those Datastream firm years in which data is available on the total number of\ndirectors and the variables described below. Firm reporting on board size is very low\nuntil the late 1970s. Coverage then increases over time. Board size observations are\navailable for less than 10% of Datastream firms in 1978 and 1979, roughly 50% in\n1980, and 84% in 1981. We base our empirical analysis from 1981 onwards since this\nyear marks the start of high Datastream coverage on board size. We exclude financial\nand property companies (Datastream Level 4 Industry groupings 80-89 inclusive). Our\nfinal sample consists of an unbalanced panel of 2,746 companies between 1981 and\n2002 for which we have 25,668 firm year observations. The balance of the panel is\nshown in Table 2 below.\nINSERT TABLE 2 HERE\nTable 3 below presents the summary statistics for the variables used in the regression\nanalysis. Our key dependent variable is profitability. Return on assets (ROA) is the ratio\nof operating profit before depreciation and provisions divided by total assets.\nThroughout the analysis we also employ two other performance measures for\nrobustness; Tobin\u2019s Q and the annual share return. Tobin\u2019s Q is proxied by book value\nof total assets plus market value of equity minus book value of equity divided by book\n12\nvalue of total assets (Cheng and Pruitt, 1994; and Perfect and Wiles, 1994). Share return\nis the annual share return over the 12 months preceding the financial year end.\nINSERT TABLE 3 HERE\nOur key explanatory variable is board size, which is measured by the logarithm of\nthe total number of directors (Board size). We employ the logarithm of board size, as do\nprevious studies which show that the relationship between board size and performance\nis convex rather than linear (see e.g., Yermack, 1996).5\nFollowing Yermack (1996) and Coles et al., (2008) we include several other\nexplanatory variables. Size is the logarithm of the market value of equity adjusted for\ninflation.6 Age is the logarithm of the number of years since the firm was first listed on\nDatastream. Debt is the sum of long term debt, short term debt and preference capital,\ndivided by the sum of shareholder funds, long term debt, short term debt and preference\ncapital. R&D is research and development expenditure divided by sales, which we\ninclude as a growth measure. STDDEV is the standard deviation of monthly stock\nreturns over the 12 months preceding the financial year end. All variables are\nwinsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles to remove influential outliers.\nIn additional tests (Section 5.4 below) we also control for the impact of board\nstructure, diversification, and ownership structure. These variables are available for\nsmaller subsamples and are also reported in Table 3. Datastream reports the number of\nnon-executive directors on the board (where non-executive directors are those that are\nneither insiders nor officers of the firm), and our board structure variable is therefore the\nnumber of non-executive directors divided by the total number of directors (%\nOutsiders).7 # Outsiders is the number of non-executive directors on the board. #\nInsiders is the number of executive directors on the board. The breakdown of firm sales\n13\nby 3-digit SIC code is available on Datastream from 1988 onwards, and consistent with\nprior studies (e.g., Linck et al., 2008), we employ the number of reported segments (#\nSegments) as a proxy for diversification (14,894 firm year observations). Aggregate\nboard ownership is available on Datastream for the two most recent years of firm data\n(5,034 firm year observations).\n5. EMPIRICAL RESULTS\n5.1 Main results\nOur econometric approach closely follows that of Wintoki (2007). The specific\neconometric regression that we run is as follows:\nROA = \u03b1 + \u03b21 Board size + \u03b22 Size + \u03b23 Age + \u03b24 Debt + \u03b25 R&D + \u03b26 STDDEV +\nIndustry dummies + Year dummies + \u03b5 (1)\nIn addition to the explanatory variables described in Section 4, we also include\nindustry dummy variables (Industry dummies) which are defined with Datastream Level\nfour industry groupings, and year dummy variables (Year dummies). We firstly estimate\nEquation (1) with ordinary least squares (OLS). In order to correct for clustering of\nstandard errors within firms, t-statistics are based on robust standard errors in which\nobservations are clustered at the firm level. The results are reported in Column (1) of\nTable 4.\nINSERT TABLE 4 HERE\nThe regression estimates show a negative and significant relationship between firm\nprofitability and board size. The estimate for the board-size log coefficient of -0.023\nimplies that expanding a six-person board by one member implies a reduction in\nprofitability of about 0.004. This change is economically significant. Since the average\n14\nfirm in the sample has an asset value of \u00a3551m, a change in profitability of 0.004 is\nequal to approximately \u00a31.95 million for the average firm.8 The negative coefficient is\nconsistent with the hypothesis that coordination, communication, and decision making\nproblems increasingly hinder board performance when the number of directors\nincreases.\nCoefficient estimates for the other variables in Table 4 are all statistically significant.\nSize has a positive effect on ROA, whilst age, leverage, R&D, and STDDEV have a\nnegative effect.\n5.2 Alternative econometric methods\nWe check the robustness of our key finding of a negative relationship between board\nsize and firm performance using a number of other different regression techniques. In\norder to further control for outliers, we employ a median regression model which yields\nan estimate of -0.025 for the board-size coefficient (significant at the one percent level).\nIn order to further control for bias in standard errors, we run year-by-year cross-\nsectional estimates. These yield negative and significant coefficients for the board size\nlog variable in 12 of the 22 years, negative and insignificant coefficients in eight years,\nand positive coefficients in just two years.\nTo address the concern that board size and profitability are jointly determined by\nunobservable firm specific variables, we employ a fixed-effects model, which represents\na common method of controlling for omitted variables in a panel data set (see e.g.,\nYermack, 1996; and Wintoki, 2007). The results are reported in Column (2) of Table 4.\nThe coefficient estimate for board size is -0.011. This is less half the size of the OLS\nestimate, but is still statistically significant at the one percent level. The other estimated\ncoefficients are of the same sign and statistical significance as the OLS results.\n15\nA major econometric concern highlighted by recent studies is that past and current\nfirm performance determines board size (Lehn et al., 2004; Boone et al., 2007; Coles et\nal., 2008; Guest, 2008; and Linck et al., 2008). Hermalin and Weisbach (1988) show\nthat firms add outside directors during\/following periods of poor performance. The\naddition of outsiders is unlikely to come at the expense of insiders and so board size\nmay increase, yet the causation runs from performance to board size and not vice versa.\nOrdinary least squares and fixed effects analysis will be biased in the presence of such\ndynamic and simultaneous endogeneity.\nTo address this concern, some previous studies employ instrumental variable\nanalysis. However, as Wintoki (2007) points out, in corporate governance studies it is\nvery difficult to use such an approach because valid identification requires us to find\npurely exogenous instruments which are correlated with board size but independent of\nfirm performance. To illustrate, we employ a two stage least squares analysis, where\nwe firstly model board size as endogenously determined by all the explanatory variables\nin Table 3 (except board size) as well as two additional instrumental variables, free cash\nflow and industry concentration. Both measures have been employed as determinants of\nboard size in previous studies.9 Secondly, the estimate of this endogenous board size\nvariable is used as an independent variable in the first regression in Table 4. The\ncoefficient estimate for instrumented board size is significantly negative. However, both\nthe Sargan test and Basmann test for instrument exogeneity reject the assumption that\nour two instruments are exogenous and valid, and therefore the use of instrumental\nvariable analysis in this case.\nIn order to deal with the problems of unobserved heterogeneity, simultaneous\nendogeneity and dynamic endogeneity, Wintoki (2007) employs the use of the GMM\n16\ndynamic panel data estimation procedure. This approach allows board size (and other\nexplanatory variables) to be determined by past and present performance but not future\nperformance, and therefore provides an appropriate econometric specification for\ndealing with the endogeneity problems faced here.10 The approach includes lagged\nperformance as an explanatory variable, and takes first differences, which eliminates the\ncompany specific fixed effects. GMM estimation then uses lagged levels (by two\nperiods and earlier) of board size and performance as instruments, which controls for\nboth dynamic and simultaneous endogeneity. We estimate the model using the\nArrellano and Bond (1991) procedure. We treat the other control variables (size, debt,\nage, R&D, STDDEV) as endogeneous, and use up to 20 years of lagged values as\ninstruments.\nThe results using GMM analysis are reported in Column (3) of Table 4. The\ncoefficient estimate for board size log is -0.019, which is statistically significant at the\none percent level. The validity of the instrument set and the success of the\ninstrumentation process in purging the estimates of second order serial correlation are\nexamined using the Sargan test of instrument validity and a test for second order serial\ncorrelation, respectively. Diagnostics for the instrument set are satisfactory. Both the\nSargan p-value and the 2nd order serial correlation p-value are insignificant (p-values of\n0.3276 and 0.3020 respectively). We are reasonably confident therefore that our key\nfinding of a negative impact of board size on performance is not driven by unobserved\nfirm effects, simultaneous endogeneity, or dynamic endogeneity.\n5.3 Alternative performance measures\nWe check the robustness of our findings to alternative performance measures as the\ndependent variable. Firstly, we employ Tobin\u2019s Q and the annual share return as the\n17\ndependent variable. Table 5 below presents the results using OLS analysis. Consistent\nwith the finding for profitability, both dependent variables have a significantly negative\nrelationship with board size. Companies with large boards appear to have lower Tobin\u2019s\nQ and lower share returns. As with profitability, the impacts are economically\nsignificant. For example, in the Tobin\u2019s Q regression, the estimate for the board-size log\ncoefficient of -0.616 implies that expanding a six-person board by one member implies\na reduction in Q of about 0.1. Since the average sample firm has a market value of\n\u00a3392m and Tobin\u2019s Q of 1.53, a change in Q of 0.1 reduces firm value by\napproximately \u00a325.6 million for the average firm.\nINSERT TABLE 5 HERE\nWe employ four different methods of profitability. We divide pre-depreciation profit\nby sales rather than total assets. We employ a cash flow measure numerator, by\nadjusting pre-depreciation profit for changes in working capital, by subtracting\nincreases in stocks, work-in-progress, and debtors and by adding increases in creditors.\nWe also examine profit before interest and taxation over net assets, and net income over\nshareholder funds. The results (untabulated) show the board size coefficient using all\nfour measures to be significantly negative.\nOne concern is that our results are driven by industry factors.11 Although we control\nfor this with industry dummy variables and firm fixed effects, we also employ an\nindustry adjusted profitability measure, calculated as the difference with median\nprofitability for all firms within the same Datastream Level four industry classification.\nThe results (untabulated) are very similar to those in Table 4, the coefficient for board\nsize log having a value of -0.02 and being significant at the one percent level.\n5.4 Additional control variables\n18\nA further potential source of bias is that of omitted variables. In particular, some\nprevious board size \u2013 performance studies control for board composition, number of\nbusiness segments, and board ownership (e.g., Yermack, 1996; and Coles et al., 2008).\nTo test the sensitivity of our results to the inclusion of these additional control variables,\nand to make our results more directly comparable with prior studies, we run three\nadditional regressions, using ROA as the dependent variable, on sub-samples for which\neach of these variables is available. The results are reported in Columns (1)-(3) of Table\n6 below, for the inclusion of board composition, number of business segments, and\nboard ownership respectively.\nINSERT TABLE 6 HERE\nColumn (1) shows that the coefficient for % Outsiders is significantly negative.\nHowever, the inclusion of this variable does not change the board size \u2013 performance\nrelation; the estimated coefficient for board size is -0.022 and significantly negative.\nColumn (2) shows that the coefficient for # Segments is significantly negative.\nHowever, the estimated coefficient for board size is -0.012 and significantly negative,\nhence the board size \u2013 performance relation is unaffected. Column (3) shows that the\ncoefficient for board ownership is significantly positive, whilst the coefficient for board\nsize is now smaller and statistically insignificant (-0.010). However, the insignificance\nof the board size coefficient appears to be driven by the smaller sample employed.\nWhen the regression is run for this subsample excluding board ownership, the board\nsize coefficient is still insignificantly negative with a similar value (-0.009). There is\ntherefore no evidence that the inclusion of board ownership changes the relation\nbetween board size and performance.\n5.5 Precise specification for the board size - performance relation\n19\nWe investigate further the precise specification of the board size - performance\nrelation to establish whether there is an optimal board size or whether the results\nsuggest that boards should always be as small as possible.12 We do this by including\ndummy variables for each different board size except for a board size of three (for\nwhich there are 801 observations), which acts as the base case. The results are reported\nin Columns (1)-(3) of Table 7 below for profitability, Tobin\u2019s Q, and share return\nrespectively.\nINSERT TABLE 7 HERE\nThe results differ by performance measure. For the profitability regression, the\ncoefficients for board size dummy variables 4 through 8 are all significantly positive,\nthose for board sizes 9 though 11 are statistically insignificant, whilst those for board\nsizes 12 through 17 are significantly negative, and increasingly so. Therefore for this\nmeasure, there is strong evidence of an inverted U-shaped relation between board size\nand performance, which suggests that the optimal board size is between four and six.\nHowever, in contrast, for Tobin\u2019s Q and share return, there is clear evidence of a\nnegative linear relation between board size and performance, which implies in both\ncases that the optimal board size is the minimum of three. Our results are therefore\nsomewhat inconclusive, the best we can conclude being that the optimal size lies at 9\nand below, since for all performance measures the coefficients for all board sizes greater\nthan 9 are negative.\n5.6 The separate impact of the number of inside and outside directors\nThus far we have treated the board as a homogenous group. However, as described in\nSection 2, board size may have different effects depending on whether it consists of\ninside or outside directors. To examine this issue, we re-estimate the regressions in\n20\nTable 4, replacing the log of board size with the log of the number of outside directors\n(# Outsiders), and the log of the number of inside directors (# Insiders). Table 8 below\npresents the results, with Columns (1)-(3) reporting the results of using ROA, Tobin\u2019s\nQ, and share returns respectively as the dependent variable.\nINSERT TABLE 8 HERE\nAgain, our results differ by performance measure. For the profitability regression\n(Column (1)), the coefficient for the number of outsiders is significantly negative,\nwhilst the coefficient for the number of insiders is not (being insignificantly negative),\nand the two coefficients are significantly different from one another. However, in the\nTobin\u2019s Q and share return regressions, both coefficients are significantly negative, and\nthere is no significant difference between the two. Therefore for the Tobin\u2019s Q and\nshare returns, larger numbers of outsiders and insiders both result in lower performance,\nindicating that the deterioration in performance stems from coordination costs, not\nnecessarily from lack of information to make value-maximizing decisions. This finding\nsupports our argument that any detrimental impact of larger boards in the UK will result\nfrom the ineffectiveness of the advisory role rather than the monitoring role. Since\ninsiders are not expected to monitor but are expected to advise, the negative impact of\ninsider number is likely the result of their advisory role being undermined. Lastly, these\nfindings are unlikely to be driven by reverse causality because it is not expected that\nboards increase the number of insiders following\/during poor performance, only the\nnumber of outsiders. However, since this finding does not hold for profitability, our\noverall conclusion is that the negative impact of the number of outsiders is robust,\nwhilst the negative impact of the number of insiders is mixed.\n5.7 Changes over time in the board size - performance relation\n21\nWe examine whether the board size \u2013 performance relation has changed over time,\nand in particular following the two significant board structure reforms over our sample\nperiod. The Cadbury Report (1992) recommended that boards include at least three\noutside directors, and the Hampel Report (1998) recommended that boards include at\nleast one third outside directors.13 Both reports resulted in larger boards after controlling\nfor the normal determinants of board size (Guest, 2008). One possibility is that these\nreforms caused an inefficient increase in board size, leading to a negative (or more\nnegative) board size \u2013 performance relation.\nTo test this, we examine whether our results differ from before to after the Cadbury\nCode. We include a dummy variable which is equal to zero prior to the Cadbury\nimplementation date (30\/06\/1993), and equal to one afterwards. We interact this dummy\nvariable with the board size log variable to examine whether the board size \u2013\nperformance relation differs following Cadbury. The results (not tabulated) differ by\nperformance measure. The profitability regression shows that the board size \u2013\nperformance relation is significantly less negative following Cadbury. However, the\nshare return regression shows that the relation is significantly more negative afterwards,\nwhilst for Tobin\u2019s Q there is no significant difference. Furthermore, for each\nperformance measure we find that both before and after Cadbury, the board size \u2013\nperformance relation is significantly negative. We conclude that there is no robust\nevidence showing that board size \u2013 performance relation changed in a consistent way\nfollowing the corporate governance reforms of the 1990s.\n5.8 Does the board size \u2013 performance relation differ by firm characteristics?\nFinally, as described in Section 2, Coles et al. (2008) argue that the impact of board\nsize on performance will differ for different types of firms. In particular, for firms that\n22\nare large, old and have high debt, large board size may be an optimal value maximising\noutcome. In contrast, for firms with high R&D and variability in performance, small\nboard size may be optimal.14 In order to examine this, we employ a similar method to\nColes et al. (2008) and include interactive variables between board size and each of\nthese measures. If the impact of board size has a different impact according to these\nfirm characteristics, then the coefficient for these interactive variables should be\nsignificant. The results are reported in Table 9 below. Columns (1)-(3) report the results\nof using ROA, Tobin\u2019s Q, and share returns respectively as the dependent variable.\nINSERT TABLE 9 HERE\nThe coefficient for the interactive board size and firm size variable (Board size *\nSize) is significantly negative in all three regressions. The coefficient for the other\ninteractive variables do not have a consistent sign across all three performance\nmeasures. The size result implies that board size has a more negative impact on\nperformance in large firms that it does in small firms. Therefore, although larger UK\nfirms have larger boards (Guest, 2008) our evidence suggests that this is a suboptimal\nrather than optimal outcome, whereby many large firms could improve performance by\nmoving to a smaller board size.\nWe explore this finding further by examining whether small firms also demonstrate a\nnegative board size \u2013 performance relation. We split all firms into quintiles based on\nfirm size for each year of the analysis. We rerun our regressions for each size quintile.\nThe results (untabulated) show that for profitability, board size is significantly negative\nfor only the largest two quintiles, insignificantly negative for quintiles 2-3, and\ninsignificantly positive for quintile 1. For share returns, board size is significantly\nnegative for only the largest quintile, insignificantly negative for quintiles 2-4, and\n23\ninsignificantly positive for quintile 1. In contrast however for Tobin\u2019s Q, the coefficient\nfor board size is significantly negative for all 5 quintiles. Therefore, for two of our three\nperformance measures, board size does not have a significantly negative impact for\nsmall to medium size firms. We therefore provide some evidence that the negative\nimpact of board size on performance is not unequivocal (although a priori we expected\nthis to apply to large not small firms).\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nUsing the largest sample employed to date over a long time period, we examine the\nimpact of board size on firm performance in the UK. The UK provides an interesting\ninstitutional setting for this issue, because UK boards play a much weaker monitoring\nrole than US firms and therefore any negative impact of large board size is likely to\nreflect the malfunction of the board\u2019s advisory rather than monitoring role. Our key\nconclusion is that we find board size has a negative impact on firm performance. This\nbasic result proves robust to regression models which control for unobserved\nheterogeneity and the possibility that board size is simultaneously and dynamically\ndetermined by firm performance. Our results are also robust to different performance\nmeasures such as Tobin\u2019s Q, share returns and other profitability measures, and to\ncontrolling for a wide range of other factors. Our results are consistent with the\narguments of scholars and regulators who have argued for small boards of directors,\nciting problems of poor communication and decision-making which undermine the\neffectiveness of large groups.\nOur results are somewhat inconclusive on the precise identification of an optimal\nboard size since this differs by performance measure, although we can reasonably\nconclude that it is less than ten members. With regard to the differential impact of the\n24\nnumber of inside and outside directors, the number of outsiders has a significantly\nnegative and robust impact. The impact of the number of insiders is also negative but\nnot always significantly so, depending on the performance measure. With regard to any\nchanging relation over time, the board size \u2013 performance relation is significantly\nnegative both before and after the UK corporate governance reforms of the 1990s, and\nalthough there are differences, these are not robust across the different performance\nmeasures. Recent studies have shown that board size is determined by certain firm\ncharacteristics, raising the possibility that board size is optimally determined. However,\nwe find no evidence that these characteristics lead to a more positive board size \u2013 firm\nperformance relation. In contrast, we find that large firms, which are more likely to have\nlarge boards, are those firms for which the negative board size \u2013 performance relation is\nthe strongest.\nThe interpretation of our results and the implications for regulation is not\nstraightforward. One common interpretation of a negative board size \u2013 performance\nrelation is that many boards are inefficiently and persistently too large, and that a \u2018one\nsize fits all\u2019 approach to board size would improve performance for such firms (e.g.,\nJensen, 1993). This begs the question as to why competitive pressures have not\neliminated firms with such inefficiently large boards. An alternative explanation is that\nsuch firms have an economically optimal target board size but are temporarily out of\nequilibrium. Coles et al. (2008) suggest several transaction costs which could prohibit\nfirms from moving to an optimal size within a short time frame. For example, removing\na director purely for downsizing reasons could damage the firm\u2019s reputation for\nhonoring implicit contracts, and therefore its ability to recruit in future (Coles et al.,\n2008, p. 335). Consistent with this, Wintoki and Yang (2007) show that firms do have\n25\ntarget board sizes and that large firms take longer to reach these targets, one possible\nexplanation for our finding that the negative board size \u2013 performance relation is\nstronger for large firms. Therefore, despite our robust finding of a negative impact of\nboard size on performance, especially for large firms, it does not necessarily follow that\na rule to restrict large boards will improve performance.\n26\nREFERENCES\nAdams, R.

For example, the UK Combined Code on corporate governance\nstates that, \u201cboards should not be so large as to become unwieldy\u201d (Code Provisions A.3.1,\nFRC, 2003).\n2 Yermack (1996) and Wu (2004) find that firms with smaller boards have a stronger\nrelationship between firm performance and CEO turnover than firms with larger boards,\nsuggesting that smaller board size improves the quality of board actions as well as overall firm\nperformance.\n3 The Cadbury (1992) and Hampel (1998) Reports encouraged an increase in the number of\noutside independent directors, but although the proportion of outsiders increased following\nCadbury (Dahya et al., 2002; and Guest, 2008), it is still relatively low and outside director\nindependence is still weak due to an appointment process which is too informal (Higgs, 2003).\n4 However, increasing outside directors post-Cadbury did result in more effective CEO turnover\n(Dahya et al., 2002), CEO appointments (Dahya and McConnell, 2005), and firm performance\n(Dahya and McConnell, 2007).\n5 Our results are qualitatively unchanged if we use the number of directors rather than their log.\n6 All the absolute variables described here and employed in the subsequent analysis are\nconverted to 2002 sterling values using the UK Retail Price Index.\n7 Due to data availability on Datastream, we are only able to classify directors as executive or\nnon-executive, and not in terms of finer classifications of independence. This approach is\nsimilar to most previous large sample studies for both the US and UK.\n8 This is calculated as follows: The log of 7 (1.95) minus the log of 6 (1.79) is 0.16, which\nmultiplied by the coefficient of -0.023 gives -0.004. This multiplied by the average asset size of\n\u00a3551m gives -\u00a31.95m.\n9 Free cash flow is a dummy variable set equal to one if for a given firm in a given year\n(relative to all other sample firms) it is ranked in the upper quartile in terms of cash holdings\nand the lowest quartile in terms of market to book value. Industry concentration is calculated as\nthe sum of all the squared market shares, where market share for each firm is firm sales divided\nby total sales for the industry, and industry is defined using Datastream Level four industry\ngroupings.\n10 See Wintoki (2007) for a detailed discussion on the advantages of this approach in a\ncorporate governance setting.\n11 For example, mature low growth industries may tend to have larger firms with larger boards\nbut also lower performance.\n12 Unlike US studies (e.g., Yermack, 1996), a sizeable minority (28 percent) of sample\nobservations have board size below six, allowing us to examine board size \u2013 performance\nrelations at very low board size.\n13 Although carried out for similar reasons, UK and US corporate governance regulations differ\nmarkedly. The 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOA) is mandatory, requiring audit committees by\nlaw to be composed entirely of independent directors. In contrast, UK reforms have been\nvoluntary and operate on a comply-or-explain basis.\n14 Guest (2008) finds that UK board size is positively related to firm size, age, and debt, whilst\nnegatively related to variability in performance.\n"}
