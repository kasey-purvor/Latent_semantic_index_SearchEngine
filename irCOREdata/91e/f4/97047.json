Introduction\n[2] The prospect of human-induced climate change has\nstimulated research into several biological processes that\nmight affect climate. One such process that has attracted a\nsubstantial research effort is the so-called CLAW hypothesis\n[Charlson et al., 1987]. This hypothesis suggests that marine\nplankton ecosystems may effectively regulate climate by a\nfeedback associated with the production of dimethylsulphide\n(DMS). Charlson et al. [1987] observed that some of the\nDMS produced by marine ecosystems is transferred from the\nocean to the atmosphere where it is the major source of cloud\ncondensing nuclei (CCN) over the remote oceans. The\naerosols resulting from biogenic DMS emissions can have\na direct effect on the solar radiative forcing experienced by\nthe Earth through scattering, absorption and reflection and\ncan also lead to increased cloud formation; the CLAW\nhypothesis proposes that these mechanisms could regulate\nclimate. Charlson et al. [1987] argued that an increase in\nglobal temperature would lead to increased biogenic DMS\nemissions from the ocean and result in an increase in\nscattering, cloud cover and cloud albedo that would increase\nthe proportion of the incoming solar radiation reflected back\ninto space (thus changing the global albedo), and thereby\ncooling the planet.\n[3] DMS is an ecosystem product. Many species of\nmarine phytoplankton synthesize dimethylsulphoniopropio-\nnate (DMSP), the precursor to DMS. However, most DMSP\nthat is converted to DMS is done so by ecosystem processes\nthat occur outside the phytoplankton cell [Simo\u00b4, 2001]. In\naddition to the climatic role postulated for DMS by the\nCLAW hypothesis, DMSP is a compatible solute that can\nprotect cells from the osmotic effects of seawater and the\neffects of freezing, may deter predation by zooplankton,\nmay act as an antioxidant, and has also been proposed to\nassist in the long-range dispersal of marine phytoplankton\n[Hamilton and Lenton, 1998; Kiene et al., 2000; Sunda et\nal., 2002; Wolfe et al., 1997].\n[4] The objective of this paper is to examine the impli-\ncations of the climate regulation process proposed by\nCharlson et al. [1987] for the dynamics of the ecosystems\nthat produce it. To do this we develop a simple plankton\nmodel that incorporates the DMS feedback mechanism and\ncompare its dynamics to the same ecosystem model without\nthe feedback. The plankton model is composed of nutrient\n(N), phytoplankton (P) and zooplankton (Z), and is one of a\nclass of NPZ models that have proved powerful heuristic\ntools in biological oceanography [Franks, 2002]. The feed-\nback processes quantified by Charlson et al. [1987] (a\nchanged light environment arising from a modified albedo\ndue to DMS production, where the changed light environ-\nment then influences the phytoplankton growth rate) were\nincorporated into the NPZ model to build a biogenic\nfeedback model that was not intrinsically constrained to\nany specific oceanic environment. The structure of this\nmodel is shown in Figure 1. Our whole-of-system modeling\napproach is similar to that of Lawrence [1993], who used a\nsimilar model to assess the impact of the feedback on\nclimate. Our approach and intention is substantially differ-\nent: we close the feedback cycle on the ecosystem, and\nGLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES, VOL. 21, GB2024, doi:10.1029\/2006GB002812, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Centre for Environmental Systems Research, Faculty of Environmental\nSciences, Griffith University, Nathan, Queensland, Australia.\n2Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0886-6236\/07\/2006GB002812$12.00\nGB2024 1 of 17\nexamine the implications of the feedback for the ecosystems\nthat generate it.\n[5] Comparisons between simulations of the NPZ model\nwith and without feedback were undertaken to elucidate the\ninfluence of the feedbacks for the ecosystem. The simula-\ntions revealed that the presence of the feedback generally\nenhanced the stability of the ecosystem by making it more\nresilient to perturbation. Resilience is a form of stability that\nmay be analytically evaluated for many simple ecosystem\nmodels. The resilience of model ecosystems is defined as\nthe negative of the dominant eigenvalue of the linearized\nsystem about the steady state [DeAngelis, 1980], and is\ninversely related to the time the model ecosystem will take\nto return to its equilibrium state after a perturbation.\n[6] A sensitivity analysis of the model with instantaneous\nfeedback (the reason we examine instantaneous feedback is\ndiscussed) indicated that such feedback always stabilized\nthe system, that is no parameter values or combination of\nparameter values used in the sensitivity analysis caused the\nsystem to become less stable than the equivalent system\nwithout the feedback. We note that the feedback system is\nmore sensitive to the magnitude and direction of zooplank-\nton perturbations than to phytoplankton perturbations. We\nalso note the sensitive dependence of the feedback effect on\ntime lags in the feedback process, and the influence of the\nbiometric rate parameters on these effects. These parameters\nare also important determinants of the resilience of the\necosystem model.\n2. Ecosystem Model\n[7] We first describe the basic NPZ-DMS model\nwithout feedback, summarized in equations (1)\u2013(5), and the\nmethods used in this analysis. We then develop the feedback\nmodel (equation (34) and equations (35)\u2013(37)).\n2.1. NPZ-DMS Model\n[8] A simple model of a planktonic ecosystem that\nproduces DMS is used as the starting point for this analysis.\nThe model is a simplification of the GMSK model proposed\nby Gabric et al. [1993], in which a DMS-DMSP model was\ncoupled to the plankton ecosystem model of Moloney et al.\n[1986]. This model is shown in Figure 1, where it comprises\nall the model components in the ocean. The ecosystem\nmodel has been simplified to a nutrient-phytoplankton-\nzooplankton (NPZ) model, a valuable tool in biological\noceanography [Franks, 2002], for this analysis and coupled\nto the DMS equations of Gabric et al. [1993]. A schematic\nof the resulting simple NPZ-DMS model comprises the\nmodel components shown as solid lines in the ocean in\nFigure 1.\n[9] The NPZ-DMS model is defined by the following\nequations:\ndN\ndt\n\u00bc k5Z \u00fe k3k4PZ # k1 N\nN \u00fe k2\n! \"\nP ; \u00f01\u00de\ndP\ndt\n\u00bc k1 N\nN \u00fe k2\n! \"\nP # k3PZ ; \u00f02\u00de\ndZ\ndt\n\u00bc k3 1# k4\u00f0 \u00dePZ # k5Z ; \u00f03\u00de\ndDMSP\ndt\n\u00bc m1gP \u00fe m2gZ # m3DMSP # m4DMSP ; \u00f04\u00de\ndDMS\ndt\n\u00bc gm5P \u00fe m3DMSP # m6DMS # m7DMS: \u00f05\u00de\n[10] Equations (1)\u2013(3) represent the ecosystem compo-\nnent of the model. These equations are written in a currency\nof nitrogen (where N, P and Z represent the concentrations\nof dissolved inorganic nutrient, phytoplankton and zoo-\nplankton respectively in units of atomic nitrogen). These\nequations conserve mass so that N + P + Z = NT always,\nwhere NT is the total nutrient in the system. Equations (4)\nand (5) represent the DMS production generated by the\necosystem and are written in a currency of sulphur (where\nDMSP and DMS represent the concentrations of dimethyl-\nsulphoniopropionate and dimethylsulphide respectively in\nunits of atomic sulphur) and these equations do not con-\nserve mass. The k and m parameters represent the attributes\nof biota in the ecosystem model and the rates of chemical\nreactions and physical processes in the DMS model. The\nparameter g in equations (4) and (5) represents the sul-\nphur:nitrogen ratio of marine plankton. The parameter set\nused by Gabric et al. [1999], derived from measured values\nreported in the literature, was selected as a starting point for\nthis analysis (Table 1, G99). The equations derived by\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of the NPZ-DMS feedback\nmodel. Dotted lines indicate the components of the original\nGMSK model that have been omitted for this analysis.\nGB2024 CROPP ET AL.: HEURISTIC CLIMATE BIOREGULATION MODELING\n2 of 17\nGB2024\nGabric et al. [1993] were used as the basis for developing a\nfeedback process to incorporate in the NPZ model to create\nthe biofeedback model. This is described in section 2.3.\n2.2. NPZ Model Resilience\n[11] The nitrogen-based components of the NPZ-DMS\nmodel may be isolated to form an ecosystem (NPZ) model.\nThis model has four critical (equilibrium) points defined by\ndN\ndt \u00bc dPdt \u00bc dZdt \u00bc 0 of which one is ecologically infeasible\nand two are unstable and not relevant to this analysis (see\nCropp and Norbury [2007] for details).

Johnson\n[1990] studied isolated Arctic lake ecosystems and pro-\nposed the hypothesis that ecosystems adapt to acquire\nattributes that endow the system with high resilience. Cropp\nand Gabric [2002] simulated the adaptation of a simple\nplankton ecosystem model under thermodynamic con-\nstraints and modified Johnson\u2019s hypothesis to propose that\necosystems adapted to states of maximum resilience within\ngenetic and environmental constraints. Laws [2003]\nreported that the concept of maximum resiliency was a\nuseful heuristic for fitting ecosystem models to observed\nplankton data in many regions of the global oceans.\n2.3. Feedback Model\n[16] The feedback model is based on the simplified\nGMSK model and comprises of the NPZ model described\nabove coupled to a model of the sulphur and atmospheric\nprocesses. The feedback model is also shown in Figure 1,\nand comprises all the model components drawn with solid\nlines in both the ocean and the atmosphere.\n[17] A DMS submodel may be extracted from the sulphur-\nbased components of the NPZ-DMSmodel (equations (4)#(5))\nTable 1.

A steady state of the DMS submodel may be\nobtained where the aqueous DMS concentration is defined in\nterms of P, Z and some parameters,\nDMS* \u00bc g P m1m3 \u00fe m5m3 \u00fe m5m4\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe m2m3Z\nm3 \u00fe m4\u00f0 \u00de m6 \u00fe m7\u00f0 \u00de\n! \"\n: \u00f011\u00de\n[18] This steady state is always an asymptotically stable\nnode, and for measured parameter values the eigenvalues of\nthis point are large and negative, indicating that the steady\nstate is a strong attractor and the DMS model is highly\nresilient. This means that the system will return to its steady\nstate very rapidly after any perturbation, and that the steady\nstate values are a therefore a good description of the system.\nAnalytic expressions describing P(t) and Z(t) are not deriv-\nable, but it is clear that the DMS model is essentially slaved\nto the NPZ model, and the state of the ecosystem model will\ndetermine the state of the DMS model. These properties of\nthe NPZ-DMS model allow the effects of the system\u2019s\nfeedback on its own environment to be included in a simple\necosystem biofeedback model. The derivation of this model\nis now described.\n2.4. DMS Sea-Air Transfer\n[19] The flux of DMS from the ocean to the atmosphere\n(DMSflux) may be modeled as a linear function of the\naqueous concentration of DMS (DMSaq) and the DMS\npiston velocity (ktr) [Liss and Merlivat, 1986],\nDMSflux \u00bc ktrDMSaq : \u00f012\u00de\n[20] Although this flux occurs only at the ocean surface,\nwhen applied in a zero-dimensional (i.e., depth-averaged\nover the mixed layer) model as in this analysis, the loss of\nDMSaq is also averaged over the depth of the mixed layer\n(MLD),\nDMSflux \u00bc ktr\nMLD\n! \"\nDMSaq : \u00f013\u00de\n[21] The DMS piston velocity parameterizes the rate at\nwhich DMS is transferred from the ocean to the atmosphere,\nand the empirically derived estimate of Nightingale et al.\n[2000] was used in this analysis:\nktr \u00bc 0:005 5:88u210 \u00fe 1:49u10\n$ %\nSc#\n1=2 ; \u00f014\u00de\nwhere ktr (day\n#1) is for a notional 48-m-deep mixed layer,\nu10 is the 10-m wind speed (m s\n#1) and Sc is the\ndimensionless Schmidt number. The Schmidt number is\ntemperature-dependent, and the experimentally derived\nrelationship of Saltzman et al. [1993] was used,\nSc \u00bc 2764# 147:12 SST \u00fe 3:726 SST2 # 0:038 SST3 ; \u00f015\u00de\nwhere SST is the sea surface temperature (!C). The sea\nsurface temperature has little influence on the piston\nvelocity, which is mostly controlled by the wind speed. A\nglobal average wind speed of 8.2 m s#1 (derived from two\nyears of SeaWinds 12 hourly measurements) and a global\naverage sea surface temperature of 16.7!C (derived from\n15 years of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer\n(AVHRR) data) were used for this analysis, giving a\nrepresentative DMS piston velocity of ktr = 2.88 m d\n#1.\nThis is consistent with the estimates of Simo\u00b4 and Dachs\n[2002] who used a nonlinear correction to zonal monthly\nclimatological wind speeds and obtained global estimates of\npiston velocity between 1 and 4 m d#1.\n[22] A relationship between P, Z and DMS flux from the\nocean to the atmosphere can be derived by substituting\nequation (11) into equation (12),\nDMSflux \u00bc ktr! m1m3 \u00fe m3m5 \u00fe m4m5\u00f0 \u00de\nm3 \u00fe m4\u00f0 \u00de m6 \u00fe m7\u00f0 \u00de P \u00fe\nm2m3\nm3 \u00fe m4\u00f0 \u00de m6 \u00fe m7\u00f0 \u00de Z\n& '\n\u00bc k6P \u00fe k7Z; \u00f016\u00de\nwhere k6 =\ngktr m1m3\u00fem3m5\u00fem4m5\u00f0 \u00de\nm3\u00fe m4\u00f0 \u00de m6\u00fem7\u00f0 \u00de , and k7 =\ngktrm2m3\nm3\u00fem4\u00f0 \u00de m6\u00fem7\u00f0 \u00de\nwhere k6 and k7 have units of mgS m mgN\n#1 d#1 and\nDMSflux has units of mgS m\n#2 d#1.\n2.5. DMS Flux and Cloud Condensation Nuclei\n[23] Pandis et al. [1994] estimated a long-term average\ncloud condensation nuclei (CCN)#DMS flux relationship\nover the remote ocean from the steady state of a model of\nthe principal gas-, aerosol- and aqueous-phase processes in\nthe marine atmospheric boundary layer. They predicted that\nwhen DMS emission flux is smaller than 1.3 mmoles m#2 d#1\nthe CCN concentration is essentially constant at 20 particles\ncm#3. In a second DMS flux regime, extending between 1.3\nand 2.3 mmoles m#2 d#1 only a few particles become CCN\neach day. A third region corresponds to DMS emission fluxes\nlarger than 2.3 mmoles m#2 d#1. The CCN concentration in\nthis regime is a linear function of the DMS flux,\nCCN \u00bc 22:7DMSflux # 15:0; \u00f017\u00de\nwhere DMS emission flux is in mmoles m#2 d#1 and CCN is\nin particles cm#3. Simo\u00b4 and Dachs [2002] estimated a\nconservative global mean annual flux of DMS from the ocean\nto the atmosphere of 6.8 mmoles m#2 d#1 (s = 2.49 mmoles\nm#2 d#1) suggesting that equation (17) is appropriate for a\nglobally representative model. Converting this relation-\nship to represent DMS in mg S m#2 d#1 using 1 mmol S\nm#2 d#1 = 0.032 mgS m#2 d#1 gives approximately\nCCN \u00bc 710DMSflux # 15: \u00f018\u00de\n[24] When applied using Simo\u00b4 and Dachs\u2019 [2002] global\nmean DMS flux estimate equation (18) produces a CCN\nestimate of 140 particles cm#3, comparable to CCN obser-\nvations of 50#250 particles cm#3 reported for the Northeast\nAtlantic Ocean by Hegg [1994]. Substituting equation (16)\ninto equation (18) then gives\nCCN \u00bc 710 k6P \u00fe k7Z\u00f0 \u00de # 15\n\u00bc k8 k6P \u00fe k7Z\u00f0 \u00de # k9: \u00f019\u00de\nwhere k8 = 710 and k9 = 15.\nGB2024 CROPP ET AL.: HEURISTIC CLIMATE BIOREGULATION MODELING\n4 of 17\nGB2024\n2.6. Cloud Condensation Nuclei and Cloud Droplets\n[25] Several authors have derived relationships between\nCCN and cloud droplet number concentration (NC) (see\nGondwe [2004] for a summary). The empirically measured\nrelationships reported in the literature take several forms,\nalthough they all describe similar (hyperbolic-like) relation-\nships. In keeping with our heuristic approach, we have used\nthe simple nonlinear relationship between cloud droplet\nnumber (NC) and the number of CCN measured by Saxena\nand Menon [1999] over the southeastern United States,\nNC \u00bc 183 ln CCN\u00f0 \u00de # 334\n\u00bc k10 ln CCN\u00f0 \u00de # k11 ; \u00f020\u00de\nwhere k10 = 183 and k11 = 334. This relationship is similar\n(differing only slightly in the coefficients) to the relation-\nship between CCN and the subcloud aerosol number\nconcentration measured over the North Atlantic Ocean by\nGultepe and Isaac [1996]. It also produces estimates of NC\nsimilar to the theoretical derivation of Chuang and Penner\n[1995] (when applied with the associated relationship\nbetween CCN and sulphate aerosol mass concentration\ngiven by Saxena and Menon [1999]) suggesting\nequation (20) is a robust parameterization. Substituting\nequation (19) into equation (20) gives an estimate of the\nnumber of cloud droplets that will result from DMS\nventilated into the atmosphere from the ecosystem,\nNc \u00bc k10 ln k8 k6P \u00fe k7Z\u00f0 \u00de # k9\u00bd ) # k11: \u00f021\u00de\n2.7. Cloud Droplets, Albedo, and Irradiance\n[26] Relationships between changes in cloud droplet\nnumber and changes in cloud top albedo (a), assuming\nconstant atmospheric liquid content, have been provided by\nseveral authors [Han et al., 1998]. These are all similar\nlinear relationships, varying only in the slope, and the most\nrecent, given by Schwartz and Slingo [1996], and valid for\nalbedos between 0.28 and 0.72, is used here:\nDa * 0:075 DN\nN0\n! \"\n* 0:075 NC # N0\nN0\n! \" ; \u00f022\u00de\nwhere N0 is the reference cloud droplet number density and\nDN is the change in cloud droplet concentration from the\nreference. The change in cloud top albedo due to change in\nthe flux of DMS from the ocean to the atmosphere can\nthen be approximated by substituting equation (21) into\nequation (22),\nDa \u00bc 0:075 k10 ln k8 k6P \u00fe k7Z\u00f0 \u00de # k9\u00bd ) # k11 # N0\nN0\n( )\n\u00bc k12 k10 ln k8 k6P \u00fe k7Z\u00f0 \u00de # k9\u00bd ) # k11 # N0\nN0\n( ) ; \u00f023\u00de\nwhere k12 = 0.075.\n[27] If it is assumed that the reference number of droplets\n(N0) is equated with the steady state of the ecosystem (i.e.,\nthe reference number of droplets includes a contribution\nfrom the ecosystem at steady state), then N0 can be\ndescribed in terms of the steady state values of the NPZ\nmodel,\nN*0 \u00bc k10 ln k8 k6P*\u00fe k7Z*\u00f0 \u00de # k9\u00bd ) # k11; \u00f024\u00de\nwhere P* and Z* are defined by equations (6) and (7)\nrespectively. The change in cloud top albedo attributable to\na change in DMS production by the ecosystem is then given\nby\nDa \u00bc k12\nN*0\nk10 ln k8 k6P \u00fe k7Z\u00f0 \u00de # k9\u00bd ) # k11 # N*0\nn o\n: \u00f025\u00de\n2.8. Irradiance and Photosynthesis\n[28] The depth of mixing in the upper ocean influences\nthe average irradiance experienced by phytoplankton. This\nalso varies latitudinally, seasonally and daily with values of\n30 m typical of equatorial regions, and 100 m typical of\nhigh latitudes. The average mixed layer irradiance at any\nlatitude may be approximated by\nIA \u00bc Iq\nMLD\nZMLD\n0\ne#kLz dz \u00bc Iq\nMLD\n1# e#kLMLD\nkL\n! \"\n; \u00f026\u00de\nwhere IA is the average irradiance over the mixed layer; Iq =\nIE cos(q) is the incident surface irradiance at latitude q; IE is\nthe incident surface irradiance at the equator; MLD is the\ndepth of the mixed layer; z is depth in the water column in\nmeters; and kL is the seawater light extinction coefficient\n(typically 0.04 m#1 for ocean water).\n[29] Zonneveld [1998] derived a photosynthesis-irradiance\n(PI) curve of the general form\nPphoto \u00bc aIP\nbI2P \u00fe IP \u00fe c\n; \u00f027\u00de\nwhere Pphoto denotes photosynthesis, IP denotes irradiance\nmeasured as the average number of photons per area per\ntime, a represents the maximum rate quantum yield per\nphotosynthetic unit, b represents the ratio of the cell\nabsorption cross section to the specific recovery rate of\ndamaged d-protein, and c represents the excitation require-\nments of the cell. Zonneveld observed that other researchers\nhad derived relationships of the same general form from\ndifferent premises.\n[30] Phytoplankton acclimate to the average light intensity\nin which they grow [Zonneveld, 1998], and it is therefore\nreasonable to assume that phytoplankton throughout the\nGB2024 CROPP ET AL.: HEURISTIC CLIMATE BIOREGULATION MODELING\n5 of 17\nGB2024\nglobal oceans are adapted to their local irradiance. The\naverage irradiance experienced by endemic phytoplankton\nat any latitude on the globe (IA) may then be scaled by their\nsaturating irradiance (IS, at which phytoplankton photosyn-\nthesis is a maximum), and the effect of variations in\nirradiance on phytoplankton growth at any latitude may then\nbe approximated by\nPphoto \u00bc aI\nbI2 \u00fe I \u00fe c ; \u00f028\u00de\nwhere I = IA\nIS\n. The maximum value of equation (28) occurs\nwhen\nI \u00bc\nffiffiffi\nc\nb\nr\n; \u00f029\u00de\nand the maximum value of Pphoto is now by definition\nachieved when I = 1, which from equation (29) stipulates\nthat c = b. The PI relationship may be applied to a particular\nphytoplankton species by scaling it to be a function between\n0 and 1 that operates on the maximum phytoplankton\ngrowth rate (k1) of the phytoplankton species. This\ncondition specifies that Pphoto (I = 1) = 1, and therefore\nequation (28) stipulates that a = 1 + 2b. The photosynthesis-\nirradiance relationship may then be written as a general\nnondimensional operator on the maximum phytoplankton\ngrowth rate,\nR \u00bc 1\u00fe 2b\u00f0 \u00deI\nbI2 \u00fe I \u00fe b ; \u00f030\u00de\nwhere b is now a photo-inhibition parameter that controls\nthe shape of the PI curve (Figure 2) and is likely to be\nspecies-dependent. Note that R is relatively insensitive to b\nonce b > 1. As b tends toward infinity R tends to 2I\nI2\u00fe1 , so\nwhen b =1, R = 0.385 at I = 5, not appreciably different to\nits value when for example b = 10, when R = 0.396.\n[31] The R curves in Figure 2 represent a dimensionless\noperator on the maximum phytoplankton growth rate, and\nequation (2) in the ecosystem model becomes\ndP\ndt\n\u00bc k1R N\nN \u00fe k2\n! \"\nP # k3PZ; \u00f031\u00de\nand the appropriate modification is also made to\nequation (1),\ndN\ndt\nk5Z \u00fe k3k4PZ # k1R N\nN \u00fe k2\n! \"\nP: \u00f032\u00de\n[32] The usual condition when the climate is unperturbed\n(by anthropogenic or biogenic activities) has I = 1 (as we\nhave previously assumed I = IAIS in equation (28)). Any\nperturbations to this steady state due to ecosystem feed-\nbacks such as described by equation (23) will affect the\nirradiance experienced by the phytoplankton, and can be\nmodeled by replacing the irradiance in equation (30) with\nthe term 1 # Da, representing the change in irradiance due\nto changes in albedo,\nR \u00bc 1\u00fe 2b\u00f0 \u00de 1#Da\u00f0 \u00de\nb 1#Da\u00f0 \u00de2\u00fe 1#Da\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe b : \u00f033\u00de\n[33] This feedback effect may be written in terms of P and\nZ by substituting for Da from equation (25) giving an\nFigure 2.

Feedback Model\n[34] A global biogeochemical feedback model incorpo-\nrating the effects of DMS produced by marine ecosystems\non climate and irradiance, and therefore their own environ-\nment, can now be written by incorporating equation (34)\ninto the NPZ model (equations (1)\u2013(3)),\ndN\ndt\n\u00bc k5Z \u00fe k3k4PZ # Rk1 N\nN \u00fe k2\n! \"\nP; \u00f035\u00de\ndP\ndt\n\u00bc Rk1 N\nN \u00fe k2\n! \"\nP # k3PZ; \u00f036\u00de\ndZ\ndt\n\u00bc k3 1# k4\u00f0 \u00dePZ # k5Z; \u00f037\u00de\nwhere R is given by equation (34). The values of the\nadditional parameters (k6\u2013k13) used for the feedback model\nsimulations are listed in Table 2. The nature of the scaling\ndescribed in the model formulation ensures that the steady\nstates of the simple and feedback models are identical (i.e.,\nat steady state R = 1).\n2.10.

Methods\n3.1. NPZ-DMS Model Validation\n[36] Often theonlymodelvalidationavailable forecosystem\nmodels is to test whether amodel can reproduce observed data\n[Franks, 2002], and theNPZ-DMSmodel (equations (1)#(5))\nused in this analysis was evaluated against this criteria in a\nstudy region in the Southern Ocean off the eastern Antarctic\ncoast (60!S#65!S, 125!E#140!E). The model was\nformulated as a seasonally forced, depth-averaged model\nfor the validation, where the state variables were averaged\nover the depth of the surface ocean mixed layer and the\nmodel was forced with climatologies of environmental\ndata. The forcings comprised ocean mixed layer depth\n(MLD), sea surface temperature (SST), photosynthetically\nactive radiation (PAR) and sea surface wind speed (WIN),\nand were sourced from the World Oceanographic Atlas,\nand from the Pathfinder, SeaWiFS and SeaWinds satellite\nsensors respectively. Time series of the forcings are\nshown in Figure 3.\n[37] Annual climatologies of ocean surface chlorophyll\nand DMS concentrations for the study region were devel-\noped from SeaWiFS satellite data and the Kettle et al. [1999]\ndatabase respectively. Model P values in mg N m#3\nwere converted to mg Chl a m#3 assuming a Redfield\nC:N ratio of 5.7 (by weight) and a typical carbon:chlor-\nophyll ratio of 50 [Walsh et al., 2001] for the compar-\nison. A genetic algorithm, an efficient nonlinear\noptimization technique that does not require any deriva-\ntive information [Holland, 1975; Mitchell, 1997], was\nused to fit the model to observed data by minimizing\nthe squared error between the model predictions and the\nobserved data. A parameter set was derived for the forced\nNPZ model so that the P population reproduced the\nsurface ocean chlorophyll concentrations climatology.\nThe NPZ-DMS model was then fitted to the DMS\nclimatology.\n[38] Seasonal forcing is implemented in the depth-\naveraged form of the NPZ-DMS model by replacing k1 in\nequations (1) and (2) with k1\n0, where\nk1\n0 \u00bc RLRTk1; \u00f039\u00de\nwhere RT is the temperature limitation of the phytoplankton\ngrowth rate and RL is the light limitation of the\nphytoplankton growth rate. The light limitation factor RL\n\u00f034\u00de\n\u00f038\u00de\nGB2024 CROPP ET AL.: HEURISTIC CLIMATE BIOREGULATION MODELING\n7 of 17\nGB2024\nis used to explicitly represent the measured seasonal forcing\nof light in driving chlorophyll and hence DMS dynamics for\nthe model validation (where it must reproduce seasonal\nvariations in chlorophyll and DMS). In contrast the light\nfactor R (equation (34)) represents the feedback light\nlimitation due to changes in albedo, and is free of seasonal\neffects in an unforced model.\n[39] Laboratory studies of phytoplankton have revealed a\ndependence of phytoplankton growth rates on temperature\n[Eppley, 1972; Goldman and Carter, 1974]. The tempera-\nture dependence of phytoplankton growth used in the model\nvalidation was estimated by Eppley [1972] to be\nRT \u00bc e0:063 T#Tmax\u00f0 \u00de ; \u00f040\u00de\nwhere T is the ambient temperature (!C) and Tmax is the\nmaximum annual temperature. RT was forced with the\nclimatology of SST (Figure 3a) for the validation.\n[40] As noted previously, the average irradiance in the\nocean mixed layer (IA) can be approximated by equation (26).\nFor the purposes of the model validation, a form of light\nlimitation on the phytoplankton growth rate proposed by\nWalsh et al. [2001] was used,\nRL \u00bc IA\nIS\ne\n1\nIA\nIS\n* +\n; \u00f041\u00de\nwhere IS the phytoplankton saturating irradiance (assumed\nto be 35 W m#2 for this analysis [Walsh et al., 2001, and\nreferences therein]). RL was forced with the climatologies of\nMLD and PAR (Figures 3b and 3c) for the validation.\n[41] The DMS model (equations (4) and (5)) was modified\nfor the validation exercise by including a term parameter-\nizing the transfer of DMS from the ocean to the atmosphere\nidentical to that used in the feedback model (equations (12)\u2013\n(15)). However, the DMS sea-air transfer velocity (ktr) was\nforced by the climatologies of SST and WIN (Figures 3a\nand 3d) for the validation exercise.\n3.2. Perturbation Analysis\n[42] The eigenvalues of the NPZ model are easily derived\nand informative; however, the eigenvalues of the biofeed-\nback model are not. The effect of including the feedback on\nthe model dynamics was therefore evaluated by numerically\ncalculating the time required for each model to return to\nsteady state after a perturbation. The return time of a system\nprovides a useful measure of its resilience as defined by\nDeAngelis [1980], to which it is inversely proportional.\n[43] The models are reactive in the sense of Neubert and\nCaswell [1997] in that they respond to almost all perturba-\ntions by initially amplifying the magnitude of the perturba-\nFigure 3.

These surfaces\nwere generated by perturbing each model 400 times using\ncombinations of perturbations of #90 to +100% (in steps of\n10%) of the steady state values of P and Z (equations (6)\nand (7), respectively). The models were integrated forward\nin time using the perturbed steady state values as initial\nconditions for the integration. Return time surfaces were\ngenerated for each model and normalized by the largest\nreturn time of the nonfeedback model. A difference surface\ndescribing the effect of the feedback was also calculated.\nAlthough the return time surfaces appear quite smooth, the\naccuracy constraints of the metric used to build them meant\nthat the difference surface was not smooth. The difference\nsurface was therefore smoothed for display; however, the\nsmoothing did not change the fundamental characteristics of\nthe surface.\n3.3. Sensitivity Analysis\n[45] A sensitivity analysis of the biofeedback model was\nundertaken to ascertain the most important parameters and\nprocesses in the model and to evaluate its behavior. The\nNew Morris Method, an efficient second-order screening\nmethod [Campolongo and Braddock, 1999; Cropp and\nBraddock, 2002] was used for the sensitivity analysis. The\nsensitivity analysis measured the difference in return time\nsurfaces of the models. This analysis quantified the sensi-\ntivity of the feedback effect to the model parameters, and is\nan important part of the analysis because, as was evident in\nthe development of the feedback model, the empirical\nrelationships used have poorly known parameter values.\nTwo sensitivity metrics were calculated: the sum of the\ndifferences between the return times of the models for each\nperturbation,\nF \u00bc\nX20\ni\u00bc1\nX20\nj\u00bc1\nRN :1;j # RF:i;j\n$ %\n; \u00f043\u00de\nwhere RN: i, j is the return time for the NPZ model from\nperturbation (i, j) and RF: i, j is the equivalent return time of\nthe feedback model, and the normalized equivalent,\nFN \u00bc\nX20\ni\u00bc1\nX20\nj\u00bc1\nRN :1;j # RF:i;j\nRN :1;j\n! \"\n: \u00f044\u00de\n[46] The sensitivity analysis was implemented to examine\nthe influence of the 22 parameters of the feedback model\n(k1\u2013k5, k8\u2013k13, m1\u2013m7 and g; see Tables 1 and 2) and was\nimplemented using parameter ranges of \u00b125% of the values\nlisted in Tables 1 (G99) and 2. The analysis made 48,400\ncomparisons of return time surfaces and required 3.87 +\n107 model evaluations.\n3.4. Time Lag Analysis\n[47] The inclusion of the feedback time lag analysis\nrecognizes that a delay between a phytoplankton bloom\nand increased DMS concentration in the water has been\nobserved [Turner et al., 2004, 1996] and that time lags\nbetween the transfer of DMS to the atmosphere and mod-\nification of irradiance are likely to be significant. As none of\nthe relationships used to build the feedback model are\nreported with associated timescales, the feedback model\nby default includes the assumption that the atmospheric\nprocesses of the feedback occur instantaneously. Clearly\nthis assumption is untenable, and hence we have also\nexamined the effect of time lags in the feedback process\non our simulation results.\n[48] The effect of time lags in the feedback processes was\nexamined by modifying the feedback model to include a\ntime lag into the feedback R that operates on the P growth\nterm (see feedback model description above). However,\nthere is little conclusive evidence indicating the magnitude\nof the time lags involved in these processes [Ayers and\nGillett, 2000]. In situ correlations of ocean-atmosphere\nDMS flux, atmospheric DMS concentration and condensa-\ntion nuclei [Andreae et al., 1995] have suggested that some\npathways may be as short as six hours [Lin and Chameides,\n1993]. In the absence of definitive evidence to the contrary,\na reasonable first approximation is to commence the time\nlags at zero and increase them until interesting model\nbehavior appears exhausted.\n[49] A numerical analysis of the difference between the\nreturn time surfaces of the NPZ model and the time-lagged\nfeedback model was conducted for time lags between 0 and\n15 days. The perturbation metric selected ensured that the\nmodel was integrated for approximately 1500 days, about a\nhundred times longer than the largest time lag, ensuring the\ndiscontinuities related to the initial conditions did not affect\nthe return times. Return time surfaces were calculated for\nGB2024 CROPP ET AL.: HEURISTIC CLIMATE BIOREGULATION MODELING\n9 of 17\nGB2024\n60 time lags between 0.25 and 15 days in increments of\n0.25 days. These return time surfaces were each subtracted\nfrom the return time surface of the NPZ model and the\nresulting difference surface was summed to give a scalar\nmetric of the feedback effect for each time lag. This metric\nwas scaled by the sum of the return time surface of the\nequivalent NPZ model to provide a proportional measure of\nthe feedback effect. This enabled comparison of the feed-\nback effects between different parameterizations as they\nhave very different magnitude return time surfaces.\n[50] The ecosystem model contains three rate parame-\nters: the phytoplankton maximum growth rate (k1), the rate\nof zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton (k3) and the rate\nof zooplanktonmortality (k5). Previous sensitivity analysis of\nthe major determinants of DMS flux to the atmosphere\n[Cropp et al., 2004] have identified the importance of k1\nand k3. These results are confirmed by the importance of\nthese parameters to the feedback effect examined in this\nresearch (see below), which also identified k5 as an important\ndeterminant of the magnitude of the feedback effect. The time\nFigure 4. Best fits derived for depth-averaged NPZ-DMS model validations: (a) model P (line) and\nSeaWiFS chlorophyll data (dots) and (b) model DMS (line) and Kettle et al.

Results\n4.1. NPZ-DMS Model Validation\n[51] The P concentration predicted by the depth-averaged\nNPZ model for the best fit parameter set derived by the\ngenetic algorithm is shown in Figure 4a with the SeaWiFS\nchlorophyll data. Similarly, the best fit to the interpolated\nDMS data derived by Kettle et al. [1999] is shown in\nFigure 4b. (The environmental forcings used in the simula-\ntion are shown in Figure 3.) The parameter values used to\ngenerate the predictions in Figure 4 are listed in Table 1\n(GA). The model produces a prediction that matches the\nobserved data well, suggesting that the NPZ model is a valid\nrepresentation of the generic plankton seasonal dynamics in\nthe region of the Southern Ocean off the east Antarctic\ncoast, and similarly that the DMS model is a valid repre-\nsentation of the seasonal DMS dynamics in this region.\nFigure 6. Normalized return time surface for the NPZ-DMS model with feedback showing the times the\nsystem takes to return to its equilibrium state after perturbation.\nFigure 7. Normalized return time difference surface for the NPZ-DMS model with and without biogenic\nfeedback. This surface is calculated by subtracting the return time surface of the NPZ-DMS model with\nfeedback from the return time surface of the NPZ-DMS model with no feedback. This surface has been\nsmoothed for clarity of presentation.\nGB2024 CROPP ET AL.: HEURISTIC CLIMATE BIOREGULATION MODELING\n11 of 17\nGB2024\n4.2. Return Time Surfaces\n[52] The return time surface for the simple NPZ model\nwithout biogenic feedback on its environment is shown in\nFigure 5. This reveals that the model is more sensitive to\nperturbations in Z than to perturbations in P, in fact\nperturbations in P have almost no effect on the return time\nof the system if Z has suffered a large perturbation in either\ndirection. This return time surface is characteristic of the\nNPZ model and is robust to substantial (but not all)\nparameter variations.\n[53] The return time surface for the feedback model is\nshown in Figure 6. This return time surface is very similar\nto the surface for the NPZ model without biogenic feedback,\nthe principal difference being that the feedback model\nreturns to equilibrium more rapidly than the nonfeedback\nmodel.\n[54] The surface representing the difference in return\ntimes to equilibrium for each of the models is shown in\nFigure 7. This surface clearly demonstrates that the inclu-\nsion of the biogenic feedback on its environment has\nendowed the NPZ model with increased resilience. The\ntime the system requires to recover its equilibrium state\nafter perturbations of any magnitude in any direction is\nsubstantially reduced by the inclusion of the feedback\nprocess. Similarly to the models\u2019 return time surfaces, the\nmagnitude of the P perturbation does not have a substantial\neffect on the difference between the two return time\nsurfaces. The magnitude by which the resilience is en-\nhanced by the feedback process appears to be largely\ndetermined by the Z perturbation. For each Z perturbation,\nthe P perturbations appear to have little influence on the\nreturn time of the system.\n[55] This increased resilience is an interesting result as the\nfeedback (R) is formulated so that at steady state R = 1 (its\nmaximum possible value) and the resilience of the feedback\nmodel is identical to that of the nonfeedback model.\nTherefore including the feedback into the model cannot\nincrease the resilience (as defined by equation (10)) of the\nmodel. The effect of the feedback when the P and Z\npopulations are greater than their steady state values, the\neffect of the feedback is intuitive; it serves to reduce the\nirradiance the P receive and slows their growth rate, helping\nthem to decline back to the steady state value. The effect on\nthe system when the P and Z populations are smaller than\ntheir steady state values is not so intuitive; the P growth rate\nis again slowed, but it is not clear how this helps them to\nachieve their steady state values more rapidly.\n4.3. Sensitivity Analysis\n[56] All of the 48,400 comparisons of unlagged return\ntime surfaces indicated that the biofeedback model returned\nto steady state more rapidly than the nonfeedback model,\nthat is that the addition of the biogenic feedback always\nreduced the time taken for the system to recover from\nFigure 8. Sensitivity of feedback effect to first-order parameters identified by the New Morris Method.\nLight region of bar is sensitivity to each parameter alone; dark region is the influence of each parameter in\nassociation with all other parameters (i.e., indicates the existence of second- and higher-order interaction\neffects).\nGB2024 CROPP ET AL.: HEURISTIC CLIMATE BIOREGULATION MODELING\n12 of 17\nGB2024\nperturbation. This result indicates that the stabilizing effect\nof adding the instantaneous feedback to the ecosystem\nmodel is robust to substantial parameter variations of both\necosystem and atmospheric processes.\n[57] The sensitivity analysis indicated that the model\nreturn times after perturbation were sensitive to both bio-\nlogical parameters describing the ecosystem and physical\nparameters describing the atmospheric processes. Both the\nraw and normalized metrics used to measure the sensitivities\n(equations (43) and (44)) revealed almost the same sensi-\ntivities to the parameters. Only one of these, the raw\nsensitivities, are therefore presented, with Figure 8 describ-\ning the first-order effects and Figure 9 the second-order or\ntwo-parameter interaction effects. Two of the most influen-\ntial parameters were k10 and k11, describing the cloud\ndroplet to CCN relationship (equation (20)), followed by\nk3, the Z grazing rate, k1, the P growth rate, and k5, the Z\nmortality rate. It is apparent from equation (10) that these\necosystem rate parameters also have significant impacts on\nthe model resilience.\n[58] Combinations of these parameters were also impor-\ntant in the two-factor effects shown in Figure 9. While the\ntwo most influential parameter interactions, k10, k11 and k1,\nk3 are atmospheric and biological pairs respectively, the\nnext most important pair k3, k10 and several other important\npairs involving k1, k5, k11 and k12 reveal that interactions\nbetween the marine ecological processes and the atmospheric\nphysical and chemical processes are important determinants\nof the magnitude of the feedback effect.\n[59] The three important results from the sensitivity\nanalysis are therefore that the consequences of the feedback\nfor the ecosystem depend on both biological and atmo-\nspheric properties, that an instantaneous feedback always\nacts to stabilize the ecosystem dynamics, and that it is\ncritically important to the determination of the actual\nmagnitude of this feedback process that both the atmospheric\nand biological components of the process noted above are\nbetter quantified by field measurements.\n4.4. Time Lag Analysis\n[60] The time lag analysis reveals that the magnitude and\ndirection of the feedback effect is dependent on the time lag\nbetween the ecosystem dynamics and the change in irradi-\nance experienced by the phytoplankton as a result of the\natmospheric feedback (Figure 10). The solid line in\nFigure 10 shows the effect of feedback time lags on the\nreturn time of the feedback model for the basic parameter\nset. This reveals that the initial stabilizing effect (by which\nis meant that the resilience the system is increased) of the\nfeedback, where it reduces the return time of the model by\nabout 6%, rapidly declines once a lag of two days is\nintroduced into the feedback. The feedback has no effect\non the resilience of the model if the feedback is lagged by\nthree days, and for lags of three to six days, the feedback\nFigure 9. Sensitivity of feedback effect to second-order parameter interactions identified by the New\nMorris Method. Light region of bar is sensitivity to each parameter pair alone; dark region is the influence\nof each parameter pair in association with all other parameters (i.e., indicates the existence of third- and\nhigher-order interaction effects).\nGB2024 CROPP ET AL.: HEURISTIC CLIMATE BIOREGULATION MODELING\n13 of 17\nGB2024\ndestabilizes (reduces the resilience of) the model, increasing\nthe return time by up to about 6%.\n[61] Time lags of six to ten days once again increase the\nresilience of the feedback model (by up to about 2%). This\nrecovery of the stabilizing effect of the feedback, with a\nmaximum in the second stabilizing region at a time lag of\nabout seven days is especially interesting given that ocean\nin situ ecosystem-scale experiments that stimulated phyto-\nplankton blooms measured a peak in DMS aqueous con-\ncentrations about a week after the bloom [Turner et al.,\n1996]. Time lags greater than ten days again result in\ndestabilization of the feedback model. It should be noted,\nhowever, that while the lagged feedback sometimes makes\nthis model less resilient, causing it to take up to 10%\nlonger to reach steady state than the nonfeedback model\n(Figure 10), it never reduces the resilience to zero (i.e., the\nsystem always returns to the steady state). For the realistic\n(i.e., based on measured values) parameter values used\n(Tables 1 and 2) both models are always stable; only the\nresilience, and hence the time taken to return to steady state\nafter a perturbation, is affected by the feedback.\n[62] The time lag analysis also reveals the influence that\nthe properties of the biota in the ecosystem can have on the\nfeedback process. The simulation with k1 doubled\n(Figure 10, dotted line) reveals that the increased phyto-\nplankton growth rate both greatly reduces the time lags for\nwhich the feedback model is initially more resilient (two\ndays rather than three) and also reduces the magnitude of\nthe stabilizing or destabilizing effects (a 4% reduction in\nreturn time). Similarly the recovery of the stabilizing effect\noccurs earlier (around four days), but lasts for only two days\nand produces only a 1% reduction in return time.\n[63] The simulation with doubled zooplankton grazing\n(k3) reveals quite the opposite effect (Figure 10, dashed\nline). In this case the increase in resilience for lags of up to\nthree days is substantially increased with return times being\nup to 12.5% shorter than the nonfeedback model. The\nregion of reduced resilience is smaller and the stabilizing\neffect is recovered much sooner at about 4 days. This\nvariant also recovers resilience to a greater extent than the\nbase parameter feedback model, with reductions in return\ntime of up to 6%. The reduction in resilience that subse-\nquently occurs is again very similar to the base parameter\nfeedback model. The distinctive feature of the increased\nzooplankton grazing model is that its region of reduced\nresilience in Figure 10 is much smaller (in magnitude and\nduration) compared to both other parameter options.\n[64] An increase in the rate of zooplankton mortality (k5)\nalso reduces the stabilizing effect of the feedback, reducing\nits initial increase in resilience to about 2%, but providing\nFigure 10. Effect of time lags on the feedback for the return time of the NPZ-DMS feedback model. The\nfeedback effect is measured as the proportion by which sum of nonfeedback model\u2019s return time surface\nexceeds the sum of the feedback model\u2019s return time surface. The thick solid line is the feedback model\nwith the default parameter set, the dotted line is with the maximum phytoplankton growth rate (k1)\ndoubled, the dashed line is with the zooplankton grazing rate (k3) doubled, and the thin solid line is with\nthe zooplankton mortality rate (k5) doubled.\nGB2024 CROPP ET AL.: HEURISTIC CLIMATE BIOREGULATION MODELING\n14 of 17\nGB2024\nthe largest reduction in resilience of over 7.5% at about day\nthree. This variant also reduces the duration of the initial\nstabilizing feedback to less than 2 days. The feedback again\nproduces increased resilience after a time lag of 5 days, and\nremains so up to about 8 days, but only marginally (less\nthan 1% reduction in return time). However, subtle effects\nthat operate for long periods of time may still be influential.\n[65] An interesting aspect of the response of the feedback\neffect to these parameter variations is that the feedback\nprocess provides the ecosystem with a mechanism to\nrecover resilience if the attributes of the biota change to\nreduce it. Increases in the phytoplankton growth rate (k1)\nand the zooplankton mortality rate (k5) reduce the stabiliz-\ning effect of the feedback, but it is apparent from\nequation (10) that they simultaneously must increase the\nresilience of the ecosystem. Similarly, increases in the\nzooplankton grazing rate (k3) reduce the resilience of\nthe ecosystem, but increase the stabilizing effect of the\nfeedback. Of these two processes, the ecosystem resilience\nis the principal determinant of the response to perturbation;\nthe feedback system with increased phytoplankton growth\nrate has shorter return times than the system with increased\nzooplankton grazing, even though the latter provides a\nmuch greater stabilizing feedback effect. An interesting\nheuristic gained from this analysis is that the feedback\nprocess provides a \u2018\u2018resilience insurance policy\u2019\u2019 in that\nchanges in the properties of the ecosystem that tend to\nreduce its resilience are countered by an increase in resil-\nience delivered by the feedback, and vice versa.\n5. Discussion\n[66] This research essentially generates a hypothesis that\nthe DMS feedback process may serve to stabilize (that is,\nincrease the resilience of) some ecosystems. The geograph-\nical extent to which this hypothesis may apply is as yet\nunclear, as the NPZ-DMS model is not able to reproduce\nchlorophyll and DMS dynamics over the whole of the\nglobal oceans. The stability attributes of the NPZ and\nDMS models suggest that the model will be best able to\nreproduce observed dynamics in regions of the oceans\nwhere the chlorophyll seasonal variation closely follows\nthe physical forcings of irradiance, temperature and mixed\nlayer depth, and the DMS concentration is closely coupled\nto the chlorophyll signal. This is generally the situation in\nhigh latitudes where the forcings are very strong and drive\nthe plankton dynamics, but is not the case in many parts of\nthe oceans. In the equatorial oceans, for example, chloro-\nphyll is often out of phase with the physical forcings, and\nthis model cannot reproduce the temporal chlorophyll\ndynamics in these regions. Similarly, the model cannot\nreproduce DMS dynamics if there is a substantial time lag\nbetween the chlorophyll maximum and the DMS maximum,\nfor example the \u2018\u2018summer paradox\u2019\u2019 observed at some mid-\nand low-latitude locations [Simo\u00b4 and Pedro\u00b4s-Alio\u00b4, 1999].\n[67] These caveats constrain the spatial range where the\nmodel can competently reproduce measured data, but do not\nnecessarily degrade the heuristic value of the model. Work in\nprogress by the authors suggests that the dynamics of theNPZ\nmodel used in this analysis is a subset of a slightly more\ncomplicatedNPZmodel that can fit chlorophyll dynamics that\nare out of phasewith their physical forcings. (The dynamics of\nthis slightlymore complicatedmodel are such that at this stage\nit does not have the heuristic value of the model we have\nused.) Similarly, S. Vallina et al. (A dynamicmodel of oceanic\nsulfur (DMOS) applied to the Sargasso Sea: Simulating the\ndimethylsulfide (DMS) summer paradox, submitted to Jour-\nnal of Geophysical Research, 2007) show that the DMS\nsummer paradox may be explained by including an extra\nDMS source term, reflecting the exudation of DMS by\nphytoplankton under UV stress, that effectively loosens the\ncoupling between the ecosystem and chemical models.\n[68] Although there are no assumptions in the model that\nintrinsically limit its application to any part of the globe, the\nvalidation exercise suggests that inferences and hypotheses\ndrawn from this exercise may only be directly relevant to\nhigh-latitude regions. Nevertheless, this research contributes\na new dimension to the DMS hypothesis of Charlson et al.\n[1987] in particular, and to the field of Earth System\nScience in general. Our results show that an instantaneous\nbiogenic feedback on the planktonic ecosystem model\u2019s\nirradiance environment can make the model more resilient\nto perturbation. The time that the system requires to return\nto its equilibrium state after any perturbation is therefore\nreduced by the addition of the instantaneous feedback.\n[69] The stabilizing effect of the feedback is largest for\nperturbations that reduce the Z population. This is an\ninteresting result, as recent work on model NPZ ecosystems\n[Cropp and Norbury, 2007] suggests that extinction pro-\ncesses in climate change scenarios will progress sequen-\ntially commencing with the extinction of Z. The presence\nof the feedback mechanism in the model therefore pro-\nvides the system with an additional safeguard against\nextinction: the smaller the Z population gets, the stronger\nthe feedback restoring the system to its equilibrium state\nbecomes. This suggests the heuristic that the stability\nproperties engendered by the feedback act most strongly\nin the manner required to both save the species and to\nmaintain the ecosystem in its original form.\n[70] The sensitivity analysis revealed two important\nproperties of the instantaneous feedback effect: that it always\nserves to increase the resilience of the model, and that it is a\nfunction of both the biological and physical-chemical factors\ninvolved in the process. Two important parameters control-\nling the magnitude of the feedback effect are the slope (k10)\nand intercept (k11) values of the regression relating the\nnumber of cloud droplets in the atmosphere to the number\nof cloud condensing nuclei in the atmosphere. The second\nmost influential parameter is the rate of zooplankton grazing\non phytoplankton (k3). This parameter was identified by\nCropp et al. [2004] as the most important determinant of\nannual integrated DMS flux to the atmosphere.\n[71] The time lag analysis revealed that the magnitude of\nthe feedback effect, and whether it increases or reduces the\nresilience of the system, depends on the time lags associated\nwith the feedback processes. This analysis revealed that the\nfeedback could make the system more sensitive to pertur-\nbation if the effect of the feedback took several days to\nimpact on the ecosystem. However, the most interesting and\nperhaps important result of the time lag analysis is that for\nGB2024 CROPP ET AL.: HEURISTIC CLIMATE BIOREGULATION MODELING\n15 of 17\nGB2024\ntime lags of about 7#10 days the feedback effect again\nincreases the resilience of the ecosystem; that is the feed-\nback causes the ecosystem to return to its equilibrium state\nmore rapidly than if the feedback was not present. The time\nlags that lead to this recovered stabilizing effect correspond\nwith time lags observed in in situ ocean ecosystem experi-\nments between phytoplankton blooms and subsequent max-\nimum aqueous DMS concentrations [Turner et al., 2004,\n1996]. This analysis also identified an important modifica-\ntion to the results of the sensitivity analysis that also serves\nto further reflect the importance of k1, k3 and k5 on the\nstabilizing effects of the feedback, and suggest that the\ntiming and magnitude of the feedback effects will vary\nbetween ecosystems.\n[72] The time-lagged feedbackmodelwe have used does not\naccount for spatial factors, and the rapid advection rates in the\natmosphere compared to the ocean suggest that only in periods\nof calm weather would the atmospheric effects generated by a\nphytoplankton bloom affect the originating population. How-\never, as the atmospheric processes involved in the feedback\nmay be rapid [Hamilton andLenton, 1998], for some pathways\nperhaps as short as six hours [Lin and Chameides, 1993],\ncouplings on local and regional scales may be close.\n[73] The influence of the feedback on the ecosystem\nmodel\u2019s stability characteristics leads to the interesting\nhypothesis that the DMS feedback cycle may not be just\nan artifact of plankton biochemistry, but an intrinsic com-\nponent of marine planktonic ecosystems. Such a hypothesis\nwould suggest that marine phytoplankton gained a benefit\nfrom the production of DMSP as it initiated processes that\nstabilized the plankton ecosystem and consequently buff-\nered the population from the effects of perturbations. Many\nauthors, perhaps beginning with Dunbar [1960], have\npointed to the susceptibility of populations to extinction\ndue to stochastic events when at the nadir of extended\n\u2018\u2018boom and bust\u2019\u2019 cycles that many low-resilience systems\nexperience after perturbation.\n[74] Such a hypothesis would require the invocation of\ngroup selection, a concept extensively attacked in the 1970s\n[see, e.g., Dawkins, 1976]. While it is not the intent of this\nresearch to debate the merits of group selection, we note that\ngroup selection is attracting new interest in western evolu-\ntionary debate [Borello, 2005] and that ecosystem evolution is\nan accepted paradigm in Russian science [Lekiavichius,\n2003]. As noted by Loreau et al. [2004] \u2018\u2018Species traits and\ntheir evolution are ultimately constrained by ecosystem pro-\ncesses, just as ecosystem properties are constrained by the\necological and evolutionary history of interacting species.\u2019\u2019\n[75] Our results clearly show that the influence of the\nfeedback is dependent on the time lags in the ocean and\natmospheric processes, and on the characteristics of the\necosystem. Our theoretical analysis suggests that clarifica-\ntion of the timescales of the feedback processes, and better\nknowledge of all the parameters in the model, would be a\nvery useful contribution to the whole DMS hypothesis.\n6. Conclusion\n[76] This research has modeled a process whereby pro-\nduction of a precursor compound by individual phytoplank-\nton, coupled with subsequent biological processing by\ncoconstituents of a plankton ecosystem, results in a prod-\nuct that modifies the properties of the atmosphere. The\nchanges in albedo we have modeled subsequently influ-\nence the irradiance experienced by the phytoplankton that\ninitiated the process. Our results demonstrate that this\nchange in environment modifies the population dynamics\nof the phytoplankton and may make the ecosystem to\nwhich they belong more resilient to perturbation. Our\nresults also suggest that the magnitude and timing of the\nfeedback effects are highly dependent on the character-\nistics the ecosystems and the atmospheric processes in-\nvolved. Although the feedback effect can reduce the\nresilience of the ecosystem when time lags are introduced,\nthe feedback increases the resilience of the system at time\nlags similar to those observed in real ocean plankton\necosystems.\n[77] The coherence of these theoretical and observed\nrelationships then raises the question of whether the\nphytoplankton-DMS-cloud relationship reflects a fortuitous\nartifact of phytoplankton metabolism or an evolved prop-\nerty that improves phytoplankton fitness by stabilizing the\ndynamics of their ecosystem. Because the benefits derived\nby an individual phytoplankton from producing DMSP are\naccrued by the group, and perhaps even the ecosystem as a\nwhole, the option that phytoplankton have evolved the\nability to influence the properties of the atmosphere\ninvokes group-level selection. Hamilton and Lenton\n[1998] have argued just such a case for these systems,\nalthough in support of a different hypothesis. The stabi-\nlizing effects observed in this study, although subtle,\nwould act over long timescales and may therefore have\nprofound implications for the characteristics of the eco-\nsystems that generate them.\n[78] Our research indicates a pressing need for clarifica-\ntion of the timescales of the atmospheric processes involved\nin the DMS feedback. Although the feedback effects we\nhave documented appear robust to substantial parameter\nvariations the implications of the feedback process for\nmarine plankton ecosystems may not be fully assessed,\nnor our hypothesis refined, until these details are elucidated.\nIf the time lags observed in real systems do indeed corre-\nspond with the time lags that stabilize our model ecosystem,\nthen such further research may yield rich results relating to\nfundamental properties of living systems.\n[79] Acknowledgments.
