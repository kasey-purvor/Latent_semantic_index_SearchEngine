INTRODUCTION\nDetermination of the band structure of a crystalline sys-\ntem is fundamental to understanding the electronic structure\nof a crystal, and hence its physical properties. While the\nelectronic structures of conventional semiconducting crystals\nhave been exhaustively studied using ab initio methods, only\na small number of papers covering this aspect of molecular\ncrystals exists,1\u20135 which may be explained with reference to\nthe computational complexity required to study such sys-\ntems. However, advances in computer hardware are meaning\nthat increasingly complex systems are now falling within the\nremit of ab initio methods.\nRecent years have seen increasing interest in the proper-\nties of molecules of biological and biochemical interest, such\nas the amino acids,6\u201310 although the majority of this work has\nconcerned the application of ab initio methods to problems\nof conformational analysis for isolated molecules in the gas-\neous phase. In the solid state they often exist as molecular\ncrystals, stabilized largely by electrostatic interactions. These\nhave attracted surprisingly little interest from a theoretical\npoint of view, save for some work concerning the shielding\ntensors of carbon-13.11,12 It is therefore of interest to inves-\ntigate the geometric and electronic structure of these systems\nfor a number of reasons. Such calculations allow an under-\nstanding of experimentally established phenomena in terms\nof the underlying quantum mechanics. This provides an in-\nsight into the nature of the interactions between amino acids,\nprincipally the hydrogen bond, allowing a further under-\nstanding of the biological functionality of proteins, com-\nposed as they are, of amino acids. A firm understanding of\nthe structural and electronic properties of these systems, and\nthe relationship between the two, is an essential starting\npoint for further investigation into the physics of these sys-\ntems. Lastly, molecular crystals, forming a state intermediate\nbetween molecules and the conventional solid state, offer a\nrich vein of physical phenomena to be investigated, and so\nprovide a rigorous testing ground of the applicability of ab\ninitio methodologies.\nIn this paper we investigate the structural and electronic\nproperties of the solid state phases of four amino acids ala-\nnine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine, and attempt to elucidate\nthe connections between the structural and electronic prop-\nerties. The paper is structured as follows. The next section\nprovides an overview of the theoretical approach used in this\nwork, while Sec. III describes the structural properties. Sec-\ntion IV covers electronic properties, while in Sec. V we draw\nconclusions on our results.\nII. COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH\nWe carry out the calculations within the plane-wave\npseudopotential formalism of density functional theory\nsDFTd.13,14 This is a powerful technique for the accurate\ncomputation of ground-state properties, here performed us-\ning the CASTEP code.15 The electron-ion interactions are de-\nscribed using nonlocal norm-conserving pseudopotentials of\nthe Kleinman-Bylander form.16 The valence electron wave\nfunctions are expanded in a plane-wave basis set to a kinetic\nenergy cutoff of 1000 eV which converges total-energy prop-\nerties to better than 1 meV\/atom. Reciprocal space integra-\ntions have been carried out over varying numbers of\nsymmetry-reduced k points, where the energy convergence is\nthe same tolerance as the plane-wave cutoff. Exchange and\ncorrelation are treated using the well-known generalized gra-\ndient approximation sGGAd due to Perdew and Wang.17 This\nis known to perform significantly better for hydrogen-bonded\nmolecular systems than the local density approximation\nsLDAd.18,19\nOur calculations fall into two distinct stages. First we de-\ntermine the geometrical structures adopted at equilibrium by\nminimizing the forces acting on nuclei using the well-known\nHellmann-Feynman theorem. This involves optimization of\nall internal degrees of freedom using a Broyden-Fletcher-\nGoldfarb-Shanno algorithm. We take experimentally deter-\nmined structures20\u201323 to determine our initial atomic posi-\ntions. These initial structures are zwitterionic, that is, the\namino and carboxy functional groups ionize via the donation\nof a proton from the carboxy group to the amino group. Once\nwe have optimized these structures, we then solve the single-\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 71, 195117 s2005d\n1098-0121\/2005\/71s19d\/195117s9d\/$23.00 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society195117-1\nparticle Kohn-Sham equations at a series of reciprocal space\npoints of high symmetry to determine the eigenvalue spec-\ntrum.\nIII. STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES\nThe determination of the structure of molecular crystal\nsystems is a formidable problem, as has been discussed by\nGdanitz:24 although one may optimize the intramolecular\nstructure relatively easily, the intermolecular structure repre-\nsents a more challenging task due to the nature of the inter-\nmolecular forces and the large number of degrees of freedom\ntypically present. Although, in principle, ab initio calcula-\ntions are able to obtain the crystal structure from the con-\nstituent molecular structure the task is theoretically demand-\ning as molecular crystals are typically bound by van der\nWaals forces; current exchange-correlation functionals such\nas the LDA or the GGAs do not describe such nonlocal in-\nteractions accurately. In this work, the molecules that we\nconsider are polar in character, and thus, as discussed later,\nwe can expect that dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen\nbonds will dominate. We use the experimentally determined\nstructures20\u201323 to provide initial atomic positions and crystal\nsymmetries, after which we may then minimize the atomic\nforces to determine an equilibrium geometry consistent with\nthe system symmetry. One concern associated with the use of\nexperimentally determined structures to provide initial ge-\nometries is that this could bias the result of the calculation.\nIn this situation, one would expect the lattice parameters and\natomic positions to vary only a small amount over the course\nof the calculation from the initial positions, as the calculation\nattempts to identify the minimum of the potential surface\ninvolved. However, this is not the case in these calculations;\nrather, examination of the lattice parameters and atomic co-\nordinates during the course of the calculations reveals that\nthese quantities may, at intermediate stages of the calcula-\ntion, vary between 4% and 10% from the final equilibrium\nvalues. This suggests that the effects of biasing are not pro-\nnounced. Of course, one could investigate this more fully by\ntaking an initial geometry far from that obtained from experi-\nment; in this case, however, one would be hindered by the\nintense computational requirements of such an optimization,\nand moreover, by the possibility of local minima caused by\nthe conformational freedom of the constituent molecules. We\nthus feel justified in the procedure used in this work.\nExperimentally, L-alanine crystallizes in the orthorhombic\nstructure with space group P212121, while the remainder of\nthe systems under consideration crystallize in the monoclinic\nstructure with space group P21. In all cases there are four\nmolecules per unit cell.\nIn Fig. 1 we show the structure of L-valine. One can\nobserve that the molecules have formed zwitterions; that is,\nthe amino and carboxy functional groups ionize, forming op-\npositely charged functional groups, via the donation of a pro-\nton from the carboxy group to the amino group; the resulting\namino group is now NH3\n+\n, while the carboxy group is COO\u2212.\nThis is expected, as it is well known that these zwitterions\nare stabilized in the solid state by electrostatic, polarization,\nand hydrogen-bonding interactions with the crystalline\nenvironment.6 This is in contrast to the gaseous phase, as can\nbe seen by examining Fig. 1sbd illustrating the structure of an\nisolated valine molecule. In the crystal one can see that the\nmolecules have arranged themselves such that the positively\nionized amine functional groups are in close proximity to the\nnegatively ionized carboxy groups of neighboring molecules.\nThis is readily understood via classical electrostatics: a bond\nbetween molecules may be formed via these charged func-\ntional groups. The molecules may also be bound by hydro-\ngen bonding between the carboxy groups and the amine\ngroups. Such bonding is well known to take place in these\nmolecular systems.25,26 It can be seen in Fig. 1 that the crys-\ntal structure allows oxygen atoms in the carboxy groups to\nparticipate in multiple hydrogen bonds; this is common in\nsuch structures.25 However, such bonds are not generally of\nthe same strength, and this is reflected in different bond\nlengths. For example, the O-H bonds between neighboring\nmolecules in the a axis, where the H atom forms part of a\ndonor group common to both bonds, and both oxygen atoms\nare in the same carboxy group, range from 1.71 to 1.82 \u00c5.\nThis though does not address why it is energetically fa-\nvorable for the molecules to form zwitterions: valine has a\nFIG. 1.

CLARK PHYSICAL REVIEW B 71, 195117 s2005d\n195117-2\nnonzero dipole moment; therefore the possibility of forming\nbonds with neighboring molecules must exist via dipole-\ndipole interactions. However, to form a zwitterion must in-\nvolve some energetic penalty: calculations on the isolated\nmolecules suggest that the energy cost of forming the zwit-\nterionic species is of the order of 0.68 eV. Therefore, why is\nit energetically favorable to zwitterionize? This is a point that\nwe return to later on, when we discuss the electronic struc-\nture of L-valine.\nOne consequence of the molecular arrangement, as shown\nin Fig. 1, is the formation of \u201clayers\u201d in the c axis, which one\nwould expect to be weakly bonded to each other, in contrast\nto the dipolar interactions and hydrogen bonding of the in-\ntralayer arrangement.\nWe may contrast this structure with that of L-alanine,\nshown in Fig. 2. Again, the molecules form zwitterions but\nthe molecular arrangement differs from that of L-valine. Ex-\namining this 23232 supercell, looking along the a axis\nreveals a pattern of interlocking \u201clayers,\u201d each two mol-\necules \u201cthick\u201d of oppositely aligned molecules. This arrange-\nment allows the interaction energy between the oppositely\nionized functional groups of neighboring molecules to be\nminimized, hence making this arrangement energetically fa-\nvorable. It is worth noting that in contrast to L-valine, no\nweakly bonded layers appear in the structure. This is signifi-\ncant, as it may explain why, for example, the agreement be-\ntween experiment and theory sshown in Table Id is so much\nbetter for L-alanine as opposed to that exhibited for L-valine.\nThis can be understood as follows: charge localization means\nthat it is unlikely that the interlayer bonding in L-valine is\ndue to any form of charge overlap. Further, the \u201cinterfaces\u201d\nof each layer are composed of CH3 groups, so dipolar inter-\nactions are unlikely to be significant. Thus one could reason-\nably assume that nonlocal van der Waals\u2013type interactions\nare responsible for the interlayer bonding. Semilocal\nexchange-correlation functionals such as the GGA are poor\nat describing such nonlocal interactions, and thus one could\nexpect some inaccuracy to be present. Contrariwise, in\nL-alanine, no such layers exist; the intermolecular and inter-\nlayer interactions appear to be primarily dipolar and\nhydrogen-bond-like, which are accurately described by\nGGAs. One would therefore expect to find the agreement\nthat is indeed found. This is also the most likely explanation\nfor the fact that in some circumstances, the theoretical lattice\nconstants have been found to be greater than the experimen-\ntal lattice constants. In connection with this, though, it\nshould be noted that GGAs are occasionally responsible for\nunderbinding in solids, resulting in lattice constants that are\nslightly too long.27\nInterestingly, for L-isoleucine, poor agreement between\nthe experimentally and theoretically derived lattice param-\neters occurs in the a axis. Examining Fig. 3 it is evident that\nthe bonding in this direction involves hydrogen bonds\nFIG. 3. Structure of isoleucine.\nFIG. 2. Structure of alanine: alanine supercell.

Thus the above argu-\nment is unsatisfactory in this particular case. Given the con-\nvergence tolerances used in this work, it is unlikely that this\nis due to numerical reasons. Examination of the structure\nreveals that the hydrogen bonds in the a axis consist entirely\nof bonds involving the single-bonded oxygen atom si.e., the\nO\u2212 atom in COO\u2212d, in contrast to the situation in L-leucine,\nfor example, where bonds of both types occur in this direc-\ntion.

Rather, this suggests that,\nin accordance with the above discussion, it is the intermo-\nlecular interactions that can be problematic.\nL-isoleucine appears structurally to be similar to L-valine,\nas shown in Fig. 3. One may immediately note the interest-\ning manner in which the functional groups on one molecule\nform hydrogen bonds with their oppositely charged counter-\nparts on the neighboring molecule. Thus individual mol-\necules within the unit cell are bound by two hydrogen bonds.\nAgain, like L-valine, examining a supercell shows the same\nlayer formation. One may postulate the following explana-\ntion for such formations occurring. L-alanine possesses a\nshort side chain; therefore it is possible for the molecules to\n\u201cinterlock\u201d to a greater extent than is possible if the func-\ntional groups are attached to a long side chain. It should also\nbe noted that this interlocking manifests itself in the perco-\nlating network of hydrogen bonds that can be observed in\nFig. 2. Thus it appears to be an issue of packing: the shorter\nthe side chain, the closer the molecules can be packed, and\ntherefore the greater the number of bonds that can be made\nbetween functional groups on neighboring molecules. Con-\nsidering an example where one has a large side chain, then\none can see that the packing arrangements are limited to the\ncase where the functional groups can hydrogen bond with a\nmolecule opposite, and perhaps form a bond to a molecule\nlying parallel to itself, resulting in \u201clayer formation.\u201d This is\na direct result of the orthorhombic nature of L-alanine com-\npared to the monoclinic structures of the other three crystals\nunder consideration. Perhaps unsurprisingly, L-leucine ap-\npears to be largely similar, and one may make the same\nobservations for this structure as have been made for the\nprevious ones.\nCurrent methods of carrying out calculations on molecu-\nlar crystals28 frequently use free molecule structures and pa-\nrameters, such as charge densities, in order to simulate the\ncrystal, i.e., a free molecule is placed in the field due to the\nother molecules within the unit cell and then a calculation is\ncarried out: the above raises serious issues about the validity\nof such an approach, for clearly it is inappropriate to assume\nthat the molecule does not relax its internal degrees of free-\ndom in the solid state. This is in agreement with the work of\nPuschnig and co-workers, who have discussed the impor-\ntance of treating the full three-dimensional symmetry of the\ncrystal in such calculations.29,30\nIV.

Certain fea-\ntures are immediately apparent, namely, the wide band gap\nof 5.27 eV. It may also be noted that the occupied states\ndisplay little dispersion, and therefore are likely to corre-\nspond closely to the molecular orbitals, i.e., to be localized to\nindividual molecules within the unit cell, as one would ex-\npect for a molecular crystal. It implies that the intermolecular\nattraction, and hence the geometric structure, is not primarily\ndictated by electronic bonding, differing from that of the\nisolated molecules, but is rather due to either van der Waals\nforces, hydrogen bonding, or dipole-dipole interactions. The\nnonzero dipole moment of valine, coupled with the polar\nnature of the functional groups involved, and their known\ntendency to form hydrogen bonds, strongly suggests that\ndipole-dipole and hydrogen-bonding interactions may be ex-\npected to dominate. This provides an explanation of the point\nalluded to in the previous section concerning the zwitterion-\nization of L-valine in the solid state: namely, that the only\nway in which a stable crystal may form is by increasing the\ndipole-dipole interaction by zwitterionization: this is because\nof the localization of the electron charge distribution to indi-\nvidual molecules. Further, zwitterionization has implications\nfor the nature of the hydrogen bond between the amino and\ncarboxy groups. In principle, it would seem that a hydrogen\nbond could form between these groups irrespective of\nwhether the functional groups are ionized or not; however,\nthe hydrogen bond that forms is stronger if the zwitterioniza-\ntion occurs. This can be understood if one examines the ge-\nometry of the molecules involved: donation of a proton to\nthe amino group from the carboxy group allows a relatively\nstraight hydrogen bond to form: this is characteristic of a\nstrong bond, whereas such a straight and hence strong bond\ncould not form if the zwitterionization did not occur.\nA Mulliken population analysis,31 although not based\nupon a unique decomposition of the electronic charge den-\nsity, allows us to place this argument upon a more quantita-\ntive basis: the nitrogen atoms have a negative overall charge\nof \u22120.77e, as opposed to a charge of \u22120.68e on the oxygen\natoms. Such a result is indicative of the nitrogen atom being\nmore electronegative than the oxygen atom, and suggests\nthat the proton bonded to the nitrogen atom will be\ndeshielded more than it would be if it were covalently\nbonded to the oxygen atom in the carboxy group.

It is further interesting to note that by zwit-\nterionization, the possibility occurs for the carboxy group to\ntake part in more hydrogen bonds than would otherwise be\nthe case, as can be seen in Fig. 1. This in itself will act as a\nfurther stabilizing influence.\nExamination of the electron charge density of L-valine is\nsupportive of the above conclusions. Figure 5sad shows a\nconstant density isosurface, and as expected, it displays a\nmarked localization on individual molecules. It may also be\nnoted that some level of charge overlap does occur between\nthe amide and carboxy functional groups of neighboring\nmolecules. This is suggestive of a hydrogen bond forming\nbetween these molecules, via these oppositely ionized func-\ntional groups, and is consistent with the discussion above on\nthe reasons for zwitterionization occurring in the solid state.\nWe can turn to a bond population analysis of the O-H\nbonds to strengthen the above analysis. The shortest bonds\nhave a length of 1.68 to 1.7 \u00c5; if we guardedly use as a\ncriterion for hydrogen bonding the requirement that the sum\nof the van der Waals radii of the atoms involved must be\ngreater than the separation of the atoms, then this indeed\ndoes qualify as a hydrogen bond. The bond contains a popu-\nlation of 0.1e\u20130.14e.\nIn Figs. 5sbd and 5scd we show the density corresponding\nto the highest and lowest occupied orbitals of the system\nrespectively. It can be seen that the highest occupied orbital\nappears to be \u201cp-like\u201d in nature, which is consistent with the\npartial density of states shown in Fig. 6, and that this orbital\nis primarily localized on the oxygen atoms. These are lone\npair electrons on the oxygen atoms that take place in hydro-\ngen bonding, in line with the discussion above on hydrogen\nbond formation.\nWe mention here that the band structures for isoleucine\nsFig. 7d and leucine sFig. 8d are largely similar to that of\nvaline. Band gaps are 4.68 and 5.05 eV, respectively. The\npartial densities of states and orbitals for these systems ex-\nFIG. 5.

Given the similarity between these\nmolecules in terms of their geometric structures and in terms\nof the functional groups present, these similarities are not\nsurprising.\nL-alanine sFig. 9d deserves more detailed attention, as its\nband structure is markedly different. It possesses a wide band\ngap, of 5.07 eV, as do the other three systems examined. The\nband structure shows more dispersion in both the valence\nand conduction band manifolds possibly because of the\ncloser packing that alanine takes part in. Examining the den-\nsity in Fig. 10 does not show a noticeable degree of delocal-\nization, which one would expect in order to produce disper-\nsion; rather, the density is largely localized to individual\nmolecules, with electron overlap confined to the region of\nthe intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The density of states\nshown in Fig. 11 reinforces this conclusion. The carbon-\noxygen bonds are slightly asymmetric, having lengths of\n1.24 and 1.26 \u00c5; suggesting that the two hydrogen bonds are\nnot of the same strength. Population analysis suggests that\nthe closest distance O-H bonds are of length 1.74 \u00c5, a char-\nacteristic hydrogen bond length, and that these bonds have\nnet positive populations of 0.12e. It is worth noting here that\nthis compares to hydrogen bond distances of around 1.7 \u00c5\nfor L-valine: this suggests that the strength of the hydrogen\nbonds is approximately constant from system to system. Ex-\namination of the orbitals, along with the partial density of\nstates, reveals that they are similar to those of the other sys-\ntems, with the highest orbitals being primarily oxygen p-type\norbitals; this is again consistent with hydrogen bonding, and\nmeans that the electronic structure of L-alanine is broadly\nsimilar to those of the other systems considered.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, this work has investigated the structural\nand electronic structures of the four amino acids alanine,\nvaline, leucine and isoleucine in the solid state. Although\nthese systems have been extensively studied by a variety of\nexperimental techniques such as x-ray diffraction, and are\nbroadly understood to be zwitterionic molecular crystals, sta-\nbilized largely by hydrogen bonding between the amino and\nFIG. 8.

CLARK PHYSICAL REVIEW B 71, 195117 s2005d\n195117-8\ncarboxy functional groups, little theoretical work has been\ncarried out to verify the validity of this picture. In this work,\nwe have calculated, using first-principles methods, the geo-\nmetric and electronic structures of these four crystals. In gen-\neral, the geometric structures have been found to be in good\nagreement with the experimentally determined structures al-\nlowing for finite-temperature effects and van der Waals\nbonding. We find that the intermolecular interactions that sta-\nbilize the crystals must be primarily electrostatic in nature,\nfor it is well known that DFT accounts well for such inter-\nactions: this has implications too for the hydrogen bonding,\nsuggesting a primarily electrostatic nature, which is consis-\ntent with the current understanding of the nature of the typi-\ncal bonds that predominate in these crystals, i.e.,\nCvOuHuN.25 The cases where agreement is poor be-\ntween theoretical and experimentally determined lattice con-\nstants are most likely due to van der Waals forces being\nresponsible for binding: these cases almost always involve\ninteractions between widely separated CH3 groups, for which\nother forms of interaction are unlikely to occur. A note of\ncaution should perhaps be made here: these molecular crys-\ntals are perhaps unrepresentative of this type of crystal as a\nwhole because, in general, dipolar and hydrogen bond inter-\nactions dominate over van der Waals interactions; this is due\nto the polar nature of the constituent molecules. However, in\ngeneral, many molecular crystals are stabilized by van der\nWaals interactions;32 the nonexistent to poor treatment of\nsuch nonlocal interactions within GGA DFT will ensure that\nsuch crystals are problematical.\nThe gross features of the electronic structure appear to be\nlargely the same from system to system; this is perhaps not\nentirely surprising, given that they all share the same func-\ntional groups; rather the only differences appear to stem\nmainly from the differing side chains. As an example, the\nband structures, densities of states, both complete and partial,\nand electronic orbitals appear broadly similar. However, the\ndifferences manifest themselves in how these molecules pack\ntogether to form crystals; alanine is notably different, in the\nmain because its much shorter side chain allows a greater\ndegree of close packing than is possible in the other three\nsystems, all of which possess much longer side chains. How-\never, in all cases the bonding mechanisms appear to be the\nsame. It is interesting to note that the structures of individual\nmolecules within the crystal structure are so different from\nthe gas phase conformers; this is largely due to the zwitteri-\nonization that occurs; however, it does have implications for\nhow calculations are carried out on these systems: it is\nclearly not appropriate to use the isolated gas phase molecu-\nlar conformers and subject these to the crystal field of the\nsurrounding molecules, for this completely neglects the\nstructural and electronic changes that take place upon zwit-\nterionization.\nThis work has produced results that are broadly consistent\nwith interpretative models. It is to be hoped that such first-\nprinciples techniques will find wider application to these im-\nportant systems, and help to place our understanding of them\nand the interactions responsible for their formation on a\nmuch firmer theoretical footing. It is to this end that this\nwork is intended to serve as a foundation for further inves-\ntigations such as the vibrational and dielectric properties of\nthese important crystals.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nP.R.T. would like to acknowledge the EPSRC for provid-\ning financial assistance.\n1 P.
