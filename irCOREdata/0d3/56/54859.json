It is\nshown how the chosen transmission voltage and frequency influence efficiency and the selection of\npower tralsmission comiponents. A key featuLre of the paper is a discussion on the use of matrix\nconverters for the propulsion thruster drive system; thereby allowing the input displacement factor to\nbe varied to mailtain maximu-lm power transmission efficiency, independelnt of the thruster power\nfactor. The nattral impedance characteristics of the umbilical cable are also considered as means of\nreducing the input filter requirements for such converters.\nIntroduction\nSeveral industrial sectors incluLding those concerned with automotive, aerospace and marine systems\nare striving to replace hydraulically controlled actuation technologies by electrically based\ncounterparts; the perceived advantages being reduced overall iass, increased reliability, increased\nefficiency and increased controllability [1]. Typically, for 'work-class' ROVs, at least 6 propudsion\nthuLster uinits are necessary to achieve six-degrees-of-freedom positioning of the ROV and associated\nmanipulators amd other tooling and auxiliaries. Whilst the power density of the electrical servo\nnachines is not as high as hydraulic-based counterparts, when considering the overail system\nincluding cable routing and support systems, electric actuation becomes a favotured solution.\nThe nominal operating depth of these ROVs is 3km below sea level, where the albient pressuLre is\n300bar, thereby requiring electronic components and systems to be traditionally housed in heavily\nconstuLcted lbar pressure chambers. However, the ambient temperatuLre at suLch depths is\napproxilately constant, at 40C, making it highly desirable to operate power electroiic drive systemis\nin thin walled enclosures to imlprove the thermal conductivity from the power devices to the\nsiesseintially infinite\" heat suik provided by the surrounding seawater. Consequently. this requires all\nelectrical components to function at increased ambient pressures.\nActive and static experiments have been previously reported [2] that identify electrical components\nthat remain operational when subject to pressures in excess of 300bar, and the vaiious failure\nmiechanisnls of comnmonly used components amd device packages, such as electrolytic capacitors\nwhich are shown to be extremlely pressure sensitive. ConsequLently, alternative drive topologies to that\nof the industry standard Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) have been investigated, since VSMs typically\nrequire a large capacitance on the DC link to provide energy storage, and decoupling between the\ninverter and the supply.\nEPE 2005 - I2'rc.xkn P.1\nBINGfLki lu-is\nDEl 2005 L)i--;c11i ISBN :90-75815-08-5 1>q1\n \nINFLU NCE OF ROV UMIBILACVL ON IOWLR QUAIUTY WHEN SUPP>LYINC LLLCThICAL THRUST LOADS\nMatrix converters provide direct 3-phase conversion with the flexibility of output amplitude, output\nfrequency and inpuLt displacemient factor control. By virtue of providing direct ac-ac conversion, they\nexllibit increased power density annd reliaDbility compared with conventional VSJs & CSTs due to the\nelimination of large energy storage conmponents associated with the DC link-the only energy storage\ncomponents reqtuired being associated with line input filters that are of significantly lower values (and\nsize) than those fouid in link-based converters, anid those used in the clamp protection circuitry that\ncan be selected from a range of pressure tolerant devices [2,3]. Although it is not possible to eliminlate\nthe filter capacitors completely, the paper details the use of the power tralnsission cable impedance to\nreduce the size of the reactive comlponelts of the ilput filter, increasing the power density of the\nconverter.\nHere then. from models of the power transmission system, a review of power transmission voltage and\nfrequency options are considered. Comparisons are then made between possible configurations of\ninput filters for on-board matrix converter-based drive systemis. It is shown that the use of suLch\nconverter configurations, and the flexibility they provide to control input power factor, can ultimately\nimprove overall power transmlission efficiency.\nTransmission System\nA power transmission system typically employed on ROVs is shown in Fig. 1(a), which comprises of\na hydraullic power pack, rated at 95kW (in this case). powered by a direct-on-line start induLction\nmachine with a nominal power factor of 0.83. The generator system consists of a ship-boa-rd, 3-phase\ngenerator supplying 120KVA, 44OVline, 6OHz; and a step-up transformer with a 3.31V delta\ncomnected secondary winding. This, ini-turn is colmected to the 3km uimbilical used to tralsmit power\nto the ROV. In a conventional hydraulically powered ROV, the 3.31V is directly connected to an\ninduction machine\/punp combination to provide hydraulic pressure for the actuLators and thristers.\nHowever, for the case considered here, an all-electrical systemi. the high input voltage is transformiied\ndown, and distribuLted dfrectly to the latrix colverter dr-ives, Fig. I1(b).\n~~~~~~AA\n3Phae Steps-up Hydralic Hydrali ria lc 3Plxase SLep-tLp Step-&ow-n Elec[rical ElecLtical\ngenctator ransforncr 3k- L-inbilic-;al pump contLol tlruLSTr gneraitoriatnsf orrnr 3 a1i abilical tralsformer drivr Luster\n(a) (b)\nFig. 1.

For the proposed electrically-based system a similar transformer as\ndescribed above is emiployed for the sub-sea step down transformer. By monitoring the excitation\ncurrents when open-circuit tests are conducted, values for the magnetising inductance, Lm (1) and the\ncore loss represented by a resistanic, R0 (2), are obtained. The voltage drop as a result of the winding\nimpedance is neglected during the test, since the supply current is small compared to the full load\ncurrent (4% in this case).\n=I H\nWI sin (cos -Ig O: I\n= (2)\nQ\n3V\n12K 2005 - I2'rc.xkn 90-75815-08-5 P.2\nBINGfLkI Cluis\nDEl 2005 L)i--;c11i ISBN :90-7581508-5 i,.2\n \nINFLUENCE OF ROV UMBIUCAL ON POWNER QUALTY WHEN SUPPLYING FLECTRICAL THRUSTER LOADS\nwhere is the angular frequency of the supply, Ij is the excitation cuirent, V0,P, is the open circuit\nvoltage and power respectively.\nTo enable the winding impedance to be calculated, short circuit tests have also been performed to\nobtain the short circuit parameters current, I, voltage, lV\/ and power, P,.

Cross-section of umbilical cable\nIn comparison to grid transmission lines, 3km lengths are considered relatively short, and would\nnormally allow the use of short-line lumped parameter models at low transmission frequencies (eg.\n60Hz). However, whilst a short-line model can be accurately employed for investigating overhead\nEPE 2005 - Dresden Pa\nBINGHA lus\nE-PE 2005, Dresden 1SBN: 90-75815-08-5 P.3\n \nINFLUENCE OF ROY UMBILICAL ON POWER QUALITY WREN SUPPLYING ELECTRICAL THRUSTER LOADS\npower lines of up to 80km in length (since the effect of shunt capacitance, C, and conductance, G, are\nnegligible), the close proximity of the conductors within the umbilical considered here has a\npronounced effect on shunt capacitance and conductance especially at frequency beyond 60Hz. Here\nthen, a medium-line model, Fig. 4, is therefore adopted. Component parameters of resistance,\ninductance and capacitance given in Fig. 4 and are calculated from standard power transmission cable\nequations[4] and verified through experimental procedures, which also allowed a value for\nconductance to be derived.\nZ Parameter Values\nResistance 8.57Q\nC L ] t Inductance 0.954mH\nCapacitance 0.42kF\nConductance 227kQ\nFig. 4. Per-phase transnmission line model of umbilical and single conductor parameter values\nfor 3000m of umbilical\nTransmission Voltage\nFor a given current density along the umbilical cable, Fig. 5 shows that increased transmission\nefficiency can be achieved by increasing transmission voltage, since the cable copper loss becomes a\nlower percentage of the overall power delivered to the load.\n101\n80\n1J2Amm2\n=J 3ANmm2\nJ =4A\/mm2\nJ = 5AImm2\nJ = 6A\/mm2\n1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nTransmision voltage M\nFig. 5. The variation of transmission efficiency due to changes in transmission voltage for\nvarious current densities\nWhilst reducing current density improves efficiency, it also requires greater conductor diameters,\nthereby resulting in higher umbilical mass and increased umbilical hydrodynamic drag (necessitating\ngreater power to be transferred to the ROV) and increased lifting capacity of the launch and recovery\nequipment. Moreover, heat dissipation in conductors within the umbilical, which remain wrapped\naround the surface winch whilst the ROV is operational, place a sustainable upper limit on the current\ndensity of 2A\/mm2. In this case, it can be seen that a transmission voltage of 3.3kV provides an\nexpected transmission efficiency in excess of 95% (from Fig. 5).\nTransmission Frequency\nBy increasing the transmission frequency, a significant reduction in the volume-envelope of wire-\nwound and other reactive components can be achieved. Such a reduction is of palticular importance\nwhen considering the inclusion of a sub-sea step-down transformer. As a first-order approximation,\nthe volume of a power transformer decreases in inverse proportion to operating frequency, with a\ncorresponding reduction in mass. However, this does consider increases in iron loss and the possible\nrequirement for increased parallel winding as a result of reduced skin depth. Practically a reduction in\nEPE 2005 - Dresden P.4\nBINCifM Clris\nE-PL 2005 Dresden ISBN: 90-75815-08-5 P.4\n \nINFLUENCE OF ROV UMBiLICAL ON POWER QUALITY WIEN SUPPLYING ELECTRICAL THRUSTER LOADS\ntransformer mass by %66% can be expected through increasing operating frequency from 60Hz to\n400Hz.\nThe 'AC-resistance' resulting from skin effect in the umbilical must be considered as the transmission\nfrequency is increased, since it ultimately reduces transmission efficiency. When conductors are\nsubject to a time-varying current, eddy currents are induced in the conductors that oppose the net\ncurrent flow. Electromagnetic fields induced within the conductor result in an exponentially decaying\ncurrent density toward the centre of the conductor, effectively increasing the resistance, as described\nby (5) where the skin depth, 5 is given by (6) [5,6]. Nevertheless, with reference to Fig. 6. it can be\nseen that at normal transmission frequencies (<1 kHz) the bulk DC-resistance remains dominant, given\nby (7), and the AC-resistance has a negligible contribution.\n~ ~ ~ +\n(1 j)Besseli ro,(t 2\nRAC =real (l-i\/i4 (5)\nzdcxBesseljt 1, 2\n2\n= J mm (6)\nR\nPI\n=A (7)dc\nA\nwhere, p is the resistivity of copper, I is the length of conductor and A is the cross sectional area.\n8.44\nE 8.42_ _\nal8.41 ----------------r ------------l------I------------ --------r----z; ----1---------I---n------------I-------------r------------\nSingle round wire\n8.39\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000\nFrequency (Hz)\nFig. 6. Transmission frequency vs resistance\nHere then, increasing the transmission frequency, up to kHz, has negligible effect on efficiency but\ncan result in a significant reduction in the size of the power transformer.\nComplete knowledge of the load connected to the transmission system, and its associated power\nfactor, is essential for calculating the efficiency of power transfer from the surface generator to the\nsub-sea ROV. At frequencies up to 400Hz, a load with unity power factor provides the most efficient\npower transfer, as can be seen from Fig. 7. However, Fig. 7 also shows that with increased\ntransmission frequency, maximum power transfer occurs when the load develops a small lagging\npower factor. The ability to control the load input displacement factor, as provided by matrix\nconverters, thereby facilitates maximum transmission efficiency for a par-ticular supply frequency and\nvoltage.\nEPE 2005 - Dresden P.S\nBINGIIAM CZl-ris\nEPE 2005 - Dresden ISBN; 90-75815-08-5 P.5\n \nINFLUENCE OF ROV UMBILICAL ON POWER QUALITY W-EN SUPPLYING ELECTRICAL THRUSTER LOADS\ncos(theta)=0.5\ncos(theta)=0.6\n-costheta)=0.7\ncos(theta)=0.8\n.9 co s (theta)= .9\ncos(theta)=1\n02 0 400 600 800 1000\nFrequency (Hz)\nFig. 7.

The need for passive energy\nstorage components in the power stage is therefore reduced to those required for the input filter to\nminimise the propagation of input switching harmonics, and a small clamp circuit to provided\nprotection against high voltages under emergency shut down and power failure conditions.\nBidirectional switch\nL J , _ 1 BV\u00b0\\WBU|WBV SWBW SWxxf\nInput Filter G 2W\nDiode clamp circuit 3-hs\nmachine\nFig. 8. Configuration of a typical 3phase-3phase matrix converter showing in-line filter\ncomponents and bidirectional switch configuration\nThe conventional input filter configuration consists Of an inductor with a shunt capacitance, as\nillustrated in Fig. 8, thereby forming a standard 2nd order low pass fihter. However, since the umbilical\ncable pBossesses significant inductance, this can also contribute to the overall filter inductance\nrequirements. Consequently consideration is now given to the passive component requirements for the\ninput filters to matrix converters, which are employed to reduce the amplitude of high frequency\ncurrent harmonics injectedt back into the supply, along with the cascadledl arrangement Of the input\nfilter and transmission system.\nAn input filter is a pre-requisite for attenuating input current harmonics clustered about the switching\nfrequency and integer multiples of it. Although the high frequency harmonics should be attenuated,\nthe filter should not influence the requirements for connection to a matrix converter-thereby\npresenting a voltage source to the converter at low frequency. Furthermore, to maintain high\nefficiency the filter should be designed for reduced loss and minimum impact on displacement factor\nEPE 2005 - Dres\nINFLULNCLO F ROV UNIBIJL.CA-LON PIOWLR QUALITY WHEN SUPPLYING ELLCTRICAL TLRUSTER LOADS\n(for reasons discussed previously). Several circuit arrangements to perform this task have been\npreviously identified [7, 8, 9, 10], the most conunon being the second-order series-L\/shunt-C\narrangement, Fig. 8 which can include a damping resistor, Fig. 9(a). This, along with other variants\nsuch as, LLC Fig. 9(b), the LCC filter, Fig. 9(c) and the cascade arrangement, Fig. 9(d) are therefore\nconsidered.\nR 2AL 4i\nTLA\nVout\nVin Vout vin{ {,u VinV Ln 1, G2 Vout\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\nFig. 9. Per-phase low pass filter configurations (a) Damped RLC filter (b) LLC filter (c) LCC\nfilter (d) cascade LC low-pass filter\nAn appraisal of the relative attributes of the presenited filters is given in terins of roll-off rates beyond\nthe corner frequency, Fig. 10 and efficiency, Fig. 11. Component values are chosen to create a corner\nfrequency at 2kHz, thereby providing a sufficient tranisition region between the input and output\nfrequencies such that they are not unduly attenuated, whilst providing attenuation at the converter\nPWM switching frequency. For the design of both the damiped LC Fig. 9(a) the LLC Fig. 9(b) and\nLCC Fig. 9(c) filters, the damping factor are chosen to be 0.1 so to maintain a high roll off in the\nfrequency region of the PWM. Values of C2 for the LCC fiter is chosen to be 4C1 where as = 4L1.\nFrom the results, it can be seen both LLC and LCC filters have a marginal increase in efficiency when\nconmpared with the stanidard second order filter and all impart superior efficiency conpared to their\nfirst-order counterparts, since they eliminate the series resistor. Although the LLC and LCC filters\nhave a nmrginial increase in efficiency over the standard second order filter, the reduced component\ncount and reduced volume of the latter makes it a preferred solution.\nFor this application, the key region in the frequency response is the first decade following the corner\nfrequency, since the switching frequency is within this region. It is therefore important to achieve the\nnmaximum possible attenuation up to the first set of hannon-ics. From Fig. 10, the attenuation\ncharacteristics of the second-order filter during the first decade beyond the corner frequency, is equal\nto that of miore coinplex filters. Consequently, the second order filter is again chosen in preference. A\ndesign procedure is therefore proposed in the next section.\n50\n------------------------- _-\n-- ----------- ------I------\n._ LCC filter\n-100\nSecond order filter\nTwo stage cascade flter\n-150\n10 102 103 104 10\nZ,\na)\nFrequency (Hz)\n200\n-- ---F-,i -:- ........ ........... ........ ........... ....... .... ......... -- -- --\n-200\n10 102 103 104 1 0\nFrequency (Hz)\nFig. 10.

Consequently, the choice of maximum capacitance is according to [12] to reduce the\ninductor size, which is necessary to obtaln the required corner frequency. This also minimises the\nvoltage drop across the series L, reducing the voltage ripple at the terminals of the converter and\nthereby improving stability. The effect of the output power on the input displacement factor is shown\nin Fig. 12, where it can be seen that a filter load power above 300W yields an input displacement\nfactor of>0.8.\n0 .8\n02L\n0 0001 0 1500 2000 2000 3000\nPoorer OW\nFilg. 12.

The complete system has\npreviously been shown in Fig. (b). However, by considering the umbilical, sub-sea transformer and\ninput filter combination, it can be readily shown that the system can be represented by the cascade\nfilter arrangement of Fig. 13.\nRf\nz\nSub sea Lf\nFig. o rY!2 VR Transformer Cf\nVSmanti the Tpi Ripaeetfco vrtefl prtn agXaxm mlmto h\nFig. 13.

Although a cascade filter requires more components when compared to single-\nstage counterparts, it will often provide a more compact arrangement. Moreover, due to the\nrequirement for smaller\/lower valued components, cost is often reduced [8].\nFrom Fig. 13 it can be seen that the input filter can be considered to be a combined cascade\narrangement of the umbilical impedance and the designated input filter, thereby reducing the size of\nreactive components. The resulting frequency response of the network, Fig. 14, shows increased\nattenuation at frequencies above 30kHz. Although this will not significantly attenuate the switching\nfrequency components, harmonics will be attenuated.\nA reduction in the filter component size can be obtained by increasilng the switching frequency of the\nconverter, since the required corner frequency can be increased and the effects of the transmission line\nbecome more dominant. From the frequency response of the cascaded arrangement, Fig. 13, the\nnecessity of the input filter is apparent. Current harmonics generated by the converter in the vicinity of\nthe umbilical natural frequency would otherwise result in high voltage at the ROV terminals and large\ncurrents drawn from the surface generator.\n- sFlter response\nLine response ,\n-1L- System response\n10 103 104 i0\nFrequency (Hz)\n200\n0)os 0\n-100.\n-200\n102 10 l0o lo'\nFrequency (Hz)\nFig. 14. Frequency response of the power transmission system\nConclusions\nThe selection of voltage and frequency for power transmission along a 3km umbilical cable used to\nsupply power to propulsion thrusters and other auxilialies onboard a work-class ROV, have been\ndiscussed. It is shown that with increasing supply voltage, copper losses are reduced and the use of\nrelatively high operating frequencies allows reductions in the mass of power system components,\nwhilst having a negligible effect on the AC-resistance of the cable. The transmission voltage and\nfrequency used to transmit power to the ROV is currently 3.3kV, and 60Hz, respectively. With\ncurrent hydraulic propulsion systems, there is little to be gained by varying these transmission\nparameters. Increasing the transmission voltage may offer minor benefits by reducing copper loss.\nHowever, this requires a redesign of the current induction-machine power pack and umbilical, and\nincreasing the insulation. The benefits of increased transmission frequency would therefore only\nbecome apparent for all\/more electric ROVs.\nAn appraisal of input filter configurations has been made. Whilst considering the frequency responses\nof the various filters, the LLC, LCC and the cascade arrangements show better attenuation at high\nfrequency, although a second-order countelpart was shown to be comparable over the first decade\nbeyond the corner frequency. Moreover, although the second order filter presented a marginal\nreduction in efficiency, compared to the LLC and LCC variants, the advantage of reduced component\ncount, mass and volume ultimately outweighed this disadvantage. A design procedure for the filter\nhas been presented, highlighting the importance of sizing the input filter components correctly to\nISBN: 90-75815-08-5EPE 2005 - Drcsdmn P.9\n \nINLUbNCE OF ROV UJBiLIcGL ON PIOW&QUAnTY WFN SUPPLYNOM CTR1UGLnIRUSTRLOA S BINGaN, C%ts\nmaintain the highest input displacement factor. It has been shown that an input displacement factor\n>0.8 is achievable for power levels >300W, and >0.9 above 500W. Moreover, it has been shown that\nby appropriate selection of input filter structure, the impedance characteristics of the umbilical can be\nbeneficially utilised to reduce the reactive componenit requirements.\nReferences\n[1] Abu.M.S Sharkh,.
