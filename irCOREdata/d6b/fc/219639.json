INTRODUCTION \n \nIn the West and some other advanced capitalist countries, many of the security needs of \nindividuals have come to be provided through formal \u2018welfare states\u2019, embracing a combination \nof pensions and social protection benefits, social services and labor market regulation. It is of \ncourse recognized that such state activities are embedded within financial and other markets and \nfamily\/household systems; the resulting ensemble usually dubbed \u2018welfare state regimes\u2019. \nAccording to an influential conceptual framework, the impact of such regimes can be analysed in \nterms of \u2018de-commodification\u2019\u2014the extent to which the state sets limits to the treatment of \nhumans as mere commodities within capitalist labor markets. In many poor developing countries, \nby contrast, both states and markets are sufficiently problematic to the pursuit of livelihoods that \npeople have to rely to a greater extent upon informal relationships. These can be reciprocal within \nsmall scale communities, but in the wider society these relationships are more likely to be \nhierarchical and thus clientelist, reflecting severe inequalities in the control over resources and \ninstitutions (UNDP, 2002).  \n \nOf course, such a simple contrast has to be refined. In more successful parts of the developing \nworld, rapid capitalist development has eroded absolute poverty, but frequently at the same time \nheightened insecurity and vulnerability. Elsewhere, managed development and growth, in parts of \nEast Asia for example, has improved human welfare. However, we have to recognize new \nhazards of insecurity (ILO, 2004) and new challenges to well-being, alongside pre-existing ones, \nin what is essentially still an unregulated global capitalist system. Yet, given this scenario, few \n 5 \nattempts have been made to discuss non-western social policy experience in a comparative way. \nIn this paper, we offer a framework and taxonomy for analyzing generic \u2018welfare regimes\u2019 under \ndifferent sets of societal conditions. In the process we develop a parallel criterion of \u2018de-\nclientelization\u2019 to complement \u2018de-commodification\u2019 and to express a continuum of welfare \noptions. In another discourse, familiar to some readers, this could be re-stated as social \ndevelopment (in the sense of enabling autonomy or empowerment) enroute to social policy \nunderstood as an acknowledged public system of rights and obligations involving state provision \nand the regulation of markets. \n \nIn pursuit of this general argument, we develop a new conceptual framework within which to \nconsider a wider range of institutions than is normally acknowledged in social policy discourses. \nNotwithstanding the unifying and converging forces of global capitalism, we emphasize the \nvariegated and path-dependent patterns of development or underdevelopment across different \nzones of the world. This builds a middle-range theory of \u2018welfare regimes\u2019, which opposes both \nteleological functionalist approaches (as in liberal modernization and Marxist stances) on the one \nhand, and post-modern approaches emphasizing uniqueness and diversity on the other hand. A \ndistinction between universal goals and context-specific means leads us to reject \u2018one size fits all\u2019 \npolicy solutions to poverty eradication, whether from the radical Right (unregulated market \ncapitalism), the radical Left (Basic Income) or the fashionable reformist Center (participation and \n\u2018good governance\u2019). In contrast we contend that social policies must reflect the particular \ncircumstances of a country or region\u2019s welfare regime. In that sense, they are the outcome of \ncountry or region-specific political settlements. \n \nOur approach is to identify the essence of social policy principles as they have evolved in the \nWest and ask what adaptations to theory are required to produce a more genuinely global yet \ncomparative framework of analysis. Of course, any comparative analysis has to be sensitive to the \n 6 \nhistory of difference between sets of countries as determined by the era of colonial relations and \nthe corresponding variance in the formation and purpose of public institutions. Even in some \nareas not formally colonized, the combined and unequal organization of the global political \neconomy has reproduced very different sets of conditions and expectations, with reference to \nsecurity on the one hand and the respective responsibilities of the state and non-state institutions \non the other.\n1\n \n \nThe experience of poorer countries in the South, and now of transitional countries, reminds us of \nthe central contribution of personal and family resources to the universal human need for \nsecurity.\n2\n Outside the West, the preoccupation with security is more starkly observed as a \nfundamental driver of human survival behavior both individually and collectively. It is more \nstarkly observed precisely because the formal institutional frameworks for the provision of \nsecurity are so precarious and fragile, if not altogether absent. The legitimacy and governance of \npublic institutions are too contested and personalized to guarantee long-term rights to those \ngroups in greatest need. As a result, people have to engage in wider strategies of security \nprovision, risk avoidance and uncertainty management. In Doyal and Gough\u2019s (1991) language, \nthe \u2018need satisfiers\u2019 are necessarily much more diverse, and certainly not derived only from the \nstate. This is where the knowledge derived from poverty-focused studies in poor countries \nquestions the institutional assumptions of Western social policy. \n \nIn accepting certain facts about globalization, we are essentially settling for a principle of social \ncapitalism, or mixed economy capitalism. We are also accepting that neither markets, nor states, \nnor communities alone can provide an adequate framework for meeting human needs (Gough, \n2000, ch. 2). Thus political economies which manage (by default or deliberation) to mix these \nthree institutional domains provide a more sustainable and flexible framework for enhancing \nhuman well-being. Accepting global reality for the foreseeable future entails that this mix will \n 7 \noperate within a framework characterized by extensive private property, in other words a \ncapitalist framework. However, agreeing with Polanyi, capitalism needs to be regulated in order \nto achieve equitable social objectives and secure welfare outcomes for all. This has been, and \ncontinues to be, the major rationale for Western social policy and Western \u2018welfare states\u2019. Yet \nhow well does this apply under conditions of peripheral capitalism, low levels of development \nand absent or partial commodification? This question represents our key point of departure for \nanalyzing the relationships between the institutional options for poverty eradication in different \nsets of socio-economic conditions within the global political economy. \n \nFive specific principles underpin our wider, comparative framework. First, that states in poor \ncountries have problems of legitimacy and that well-functioning labor and financial markets are \nnot pervasive. Second, that these problematic conditions limit the capacity of the state to act in a \ncompensatory way for the inequitable outcomes of the market in highly unequal societies \n(unequal in both a vertical and horizontal sense). Thirdly, that a comparative conception of social \npolicy has to embrace non-state centered actors. This implies, fourthly, that rights and \nentitlements may also be found (in some instances, securely) in the informal domains of social \nrelationships and cultural expectations. Some of these domains are more formally organized \n(churches and mosques, charities, NGOs and philanthropy generally), while others are more \npersonalized in a range of clientelist and reciprocal (perhaps kin) arrangements. Finally, attached \nto the notion of \u2018regime\u2019 is the assumption of path dependency, whereby outcomes from political \neconomy and the deliberate interventions of state and non-state actors reproduce stratification, \ninequalities and power differences. Within this there is some variation: simple reproduction \ntotally enshrines path dependency, whereas \u2018extended reproduction\u2019 introduces possibilities of \nnew mobilizations, identities and solidarities with the potential to alter the regime\u2019s direction. \n \n 8 \nThese arguments are developed and defended in the following sections. First, we distinguish \nwelfare regimes from welfare state regimes, and go on to define two new meta-regimes: informal \nsecurity regimes and insecurity regimes. Second, we provide a theoretical framework to \nunderstand and analyze all regime types, and spell out in more detail the community and global \ndimensions of our approach. Third, we provide empirical evidence to support the regime \nframework, of two kinds: a large-N cluster analysis to identify different regime types across the \nworld, and summaries of four regional case studies, covering Bangladesh and South Asia, Latin \nAmerica, East Asia, and Africa. Lastly, we propose a strategy of de-clientelization as the route to \nmove informal security regimes towards decommodifying welfare state regimes. This strategy is \nderived from our central premise that formally guaranteed rights to welfare and employment \nsecurity, embodied in legitimated states and regulated labor markets, will always be superior to a \nclientelist, or even reciprocal, system of informal rights which deliver dependent rather than \nautonomous security. We conclude by re-affirming that position. \n \n \n2. THE THREE REGIMES \n \nIn adopting a regime approach we are placing ourselves within the historical-institutional school \nof social research. This integrates structures and actors within a framework which promises a \ncomparative analysis of socio-economic systems at different stages of development and different \npositions in the world system (Giddens, 1971; Gough, 2000, ch. 2). Similarly it seeks to reconcile \nthe rival \u2018structural\u2019 and \u2018actor\u2019 approaches within development sociology (Buttel & McMichael, \n1994; Long & van der Ploeg, 1994). We recognize that structures are socially constructed, \nreproduced and changed through the actions of people in real time, but that, at given points in \n 9 \ntime, actors occupy different interest and power positions within structures, giving them different \ngoals, levels of autonomy and clout. \n \n\u2018Regime\u2019 refers to a set of rules, institutions and structured interests that constrain individuals \nthrough compliance procedures (Krasner, 1983 pp. 1-3; North, 1990, pp. 200-202). Analytically \nspeaking these rules and norms may be imposed from above using forms of political power, or \nthey may \u2018emerge informally\u2019 out of regular face-to-face interaction. Empirically there is an \ninteraction between the two: regimes are always related to issues of power, conflict, domination \nand accommodation (O\u2019Connor, Orloff & Shaver, 1999, ch. 1). Regimes tend to reproduce \nthemselves through time as a result of the way that interests are defined and structured. In \nsituations of rapid change, disruption or crisis regimes can break down, to be replaced by a \ndifferent regime or by regime competition or by institutional breakdown. \n \nIn order to use this framework to analyze issues of welfare and security we modify Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s (1990, 1999) concept of \u2018welfare state regimes\u2019 and his analysis of the \u2018three worlds \nof welfare capitalism\u2019 in the West (Wood, 2003b; Gough & Wood et al., 2004). Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s concept of welfare state regime contains four elements, not entirely congruent. First, \nit applies to capitalist societies that have been transformed into welfare states, i.e. not countries \nthat happen to engage in a bit of social policy on the side, but societies so deeply affected by their \nnon-residual, pervasive social policies that they are best defined as welfare states.\n3\n Second, the \nconcept denotes the ways in which states, markets and households interact in the provision of \nwelfare: the welfare state is embedded in a broader \u2018welfare mix\u2019. Third, it identifies a process of \nde-commodification through state action and measures this as the degree of social protection \nprovided against total dependence on market forces. The OECD countries vary greatly here. \nFourth, in these circumstances social policies not only reflect but reproduce \u2018stratification\u2019 \noutcomes in terms of power, as well as class and other forms of inequality. In this way social \n 10 \npolicies shape political divisions and alliances and, usually, reproduce them through time in a \npath-dependent way.  \n \nOn the basis of the last three dimensions, Esping-Andersen distinguished three welfare state \nregimes in the OECD world, which he labels liberal, conservative and social democratic. \nHowever, we want to probe further the common features underlying all these varieties of welfare \nstate regime. We contend that the following nine elements are integral to the welfare state regime \nparadigm. \n \n1. The dominant mode of production is capitalist. There is a division of labor based on the \nownership or non-ownership of capital; the dominant form of coordination is ex post via \nmarket signals; the technological base is dynamic, driven by a never-ending search for profit. \n2. A set of class relations is based on this division of labor. The dominant form of inequality \nderives from exploitation of wage laborers by owners of capital and land. \n3. The dominant means of securing livelihoods is via employment in formal labor markets; \nconversely, the major threats to security stem from interrupted access to labor markets, due to \nill health, old age, unemployment or other contingencies. \n4. Political mobilization by the working classes and other classes and the ensuing democratic \nclass struggle shapes an inter-class \u2018political settlement\u2019.  \n5. There is a relatively autonomous state bounded by the structural power of capital but open to \nclass mobilization and voice and able to take initiatives on its own behalf. \n6. These factors, together with inherited institutional structures, shape a set of state institutions \nand practices which undertake social interventions. This state intervention combines with \nmarket and family structures and processes to construct a \u2018welfare mix\u2019. \n 11 \n7. This welfare mix de-commodifies labor to varying degrees (and provides social services as \nwell as investing in human capital).  \n8. Together the welfare mix and welfare outcomes influence the definition of interests and the \ndistribution of class power resources which tend to reproduce the welfare regime through \ntime. \n9. Within each regime, \u2018social policy\u2019 entails intentional action within the public sphere, \nnormally intended to achieve normative, welfare-oriented goals. \n \nEach one of these elements must be re-examined when our attention turns from the North to the \nSouth. There is not the space here to elaborate this in detail; rather the results of our \ninterrogations are summarized in Table 1. The upshot is that, alongside the above welfare state \nregimes, we identify two other quite different meta-welfare regimes: informal security regimes \nand insecurity regimes (Gough & Wood et al., 2004, part I). The latter two embrace extensive \nnon-state as well as state institutions in the reproduction of security and insecurity, and \nacknowledge the wide and varied experience of peripheral capitalism. \n \n \nTable 1 here \n \n \nInformal security regimes describe institutional arrangements where people rely heavily upon \ncommunity and family relationships to meet their security needs, to greatly varying degrees. \nThese relationships are usually hierarchical and asymmetrical. This results in problematic \ninclusion or adverse incorporation, whereby poorer people trade some short-term security in \nreturn for longer-term vulnerability and dependence. The underlying patron-client relations are \n 12 \nthen reinforced and can prove extremely resistant to civil society pressures and measures to \nreform them along welfare state lines. Nevertheless, these relations do comprise a series of \ninformal rights and afford some measure of informal security.   \n \nInsecurity regimes describe institutional arrangements which generate gross insecurity and block \nthe emergence of stable informal mechanisms to mitigate, let alone rectify, these. These regimes \narise in areas of the world where powerful external players interact with weak internal actors to \ngenerate conflict and political instability. Insecurity regimes are rarely confined within national \nboundaries. The unpredictable environment undermines stable patterns of clientelism and \ninformal rights within communities and can destroy household coping mechanisms. In the face of \nlocal warlords and other actors, governments cannot play even a vestigial governance and \nsecurity-enhancing role. The result is a vicious circle of insecurity, vulnerability and suffering for \nall but a small elite and their enforcers and clients. \n \nThus we retain the idea of \u2018welfare regime\u2019 to refer to repeated systemic arrangements through \nwhich people seek livelihood security both for their own lives and for those of their children, \ndescendants and elders\n4\n. Substantively, the notion of a welfare regime embodies the relationship \nbetween sets of rights on the one hand and the performance of correlative duties on the other. The \nmanner in which that relationship is specified is a product of history, especially a history \nreflecting the interrelation in different epochs between domestic institutions and the global \neconomy. Those interrelations circumscribe the relative autonomy and legitimacy of the state, and \nbring a range of non-state actors at global as well as local level into our generalized account of \nsocial policy. Thus for many societies today, rights cannot only be understood in a strict statutory \nsense; and correlative duties will come, if at all, from domains other than the domestic state. \n \n 13 \nOf course, reality is more complicated than such a classification, in the sense that regions or \ncountries within them can combine elements of all three types within a single social formation. \nThus different categories of a country\u2019s population can experience different primary regimes: \nsome might be successfully incorporated into state protection; others reliant upon community and \nfamily arrangements; and others more excluded from formal or informal mainstream \narrangements and reliant upon highly personalized politico-militia patrons, in which a sense of \ninsecurity is prevalent. But within that complexity of hybrids, we are certainly clustering different \ncountries of the world into a primary association with one of these three regime groups.\n5\n \n \n \n3. THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK \n \nWe derive these broad types of welfare regimes within a theoretical framework presented in \nFigure 1. It comprises four components: the institutional framework, the institutional \nresponsibility matrix (IRM) or welfare mix, the welfare situation of the population, and the \npattern of stratification and mobilization.  \n \n \nFigure 1 here \n \n \nLet us begin at the bottom right of Figure 1 with the final evaluative principle: the welfare \noutcomes of the population. These refer to the extent of poverty and other measures of low or \ninadequate resources, the need-satisfactions of the population (the extent to which their basic and \nintermediate needs are met), and the insecurity they experience. These welfare outcomes are \n 14 \nexplained most immediately by the IRM or welfare mix (top right of Figure 1). This is the \ninstitutional landscape within which people have to pursue their livelihoods and well-being \nobjectives, referring to the role of government, community (informal as well as organized, such \nas NGOs and Community Based Organisations), private sector market activity, and the household \nin mitigating insecurity and well-being, alongside the role of matching international actors and \nprocesses. The welfare mix in turn is greatly shaped by the basic institutional conditions in a \ncountry (top left of Figure 1): the pervasiveness and character of markets, the legitimacy of the \nstate, the extent of societal integration, cultural values and the position of the country in the \nglobal system. Finally, the stratification system and pattern of political mobilization by elites and \nother groups (bottom left of Figure 1) is both cause and consequence of the other factors. The \nstratification system refers to the existing distribution of power in society and the range of \nsocietal inequalities. These shape\u2014but do not determine\u2014the attendant mobilizations of different \ngroups and coalitions. These will frequently reproduce the institutional conditions of the society, \nbut they may act to undermine them and thus alter the welfare mix and patterns of welfare of the \ncountry. On the other hand, the welfare mix and welfare outcomes also influence the nature of \npolitical mobilizations in the future.  \n \nWithin this framework, two features of the institutional responsibility matrix are especially \ninnovative: the community and global dimensions. In Esping-Andersen\u2019s approach the state is \nprivileged as the key institutional actor\u2014even when its role is to \u2018roll back the state\u2019 as under \nneo-liberal governments in the 1980s. However, to deal with the different conditions in poorer \nand transitional countries, we transform his triad of state-market-family into an octagon (see \nabove, Figure 1, top right box). First, we add a \u2018community\u2019 domain to the other three. The notion \nof community here refers to the multitude of sub-societal organizational forms, including NGOs, \nand the related notion of civil society. The addition of \u2018community\u2019 results in what Wood (2000, \n2003a) previously called the \u2018institutional responsibility square\u2019. But here, we add a global \n 15 \ndimension, recognizing that poorer, and now transitional, countries have a greater over-reliance in \nall four domains upon international actors and transfers. This results in a supra-national \nequivalent of the four domestic components: global markets; donors and other international \ngovernmental organizations; international NGOs and other \u2018voice\u2019 organizations; and the \n\u2018internationalized household\u2019\u2014trying to avert risk predominantly though migration and \nremittances.  \n \nFour further points need to be made about the significance of this simple modification. First, we \nare explicitly moving on from a legal discourse about rights and entitlements which sees them \nonly existing in a statutory sense with formal sanctions to ensure the fulfillment of correlative \nduties. Rather we are adding the possibility that for poor people in poor countries, meaningful \nrights and correlative duties may be found through informal community arrangements. Thus we \noffer a sociological rather than essentially legal discourse about rights. And we also recognize \nthat rights and correlative duties in all four domains may degrade and break down. This, alas, is \nthe institutional reality for many of the poorest parts of the world whether in sub-Saharan Africa \n(Bevan, 2004b), or Afghanistan or the West Bank and Gaza. \n \nSecond, the notion of \u2018community\u2019 has to be deconstructed with subtlety. It is not just a reference \nto small scale, homogenous reciprocity. Rather it represents a wider range of institutional \npractices between the state and the household involving hierarchy as well as reciprocity, thus \ninequality and power. It also represents a continuum from immediately local and ascriptive \nrelations (kinship groups, clans, villages and so on) to wider, more organized and purposive ones \n(civil society organizations, including non-governmental organizations). In another language it \nrepresents the range of institutional practices from personal networks to more abstract social \ncapital.  \n \n 16 \nThird, the international dimension connects to all four domestic domains. Within poorer countries \nwith high aid dependency as well as reliance upon foreign direct investment and household \nincomes diversified through migration and remittances, the relationship between informal and \nformal rights and correlative duties clearly extends beyond the domestic arena; the international \ndimensions should therefore be included within the welfare regime. In effect the international \ndimension expands the risk pool within which security is sought and uncertainty managed.  \n \nFourth, a crucial feature that the IRM shares in common with welfare regime analysis is that \nthese institutions do not operate independently from the others in terms of rules and pervading \nmoralities. In other words, there is \u2018permeability\u2019. This in turn sets limits to the possibility of one \nset of institutions counteracting or compensating for the dysfunctional effects of another.  \n \nIt has been familiar to assert that the state can compensate, in distributional terms, for the \nmarket.\n6\n While there is truth to this argument, this truth re-affirms permeability rather than \nchallenges it. So, in developed, politically settled, societies, we might acknowledge a consistency \nbetween the publicly-espoused principles of fairness, equity, transparency and trust as they \noperate in all domestic institutions of the IRM. Of course people are selfish and engage, for \nexample, in tax avoidance and cheating, but not to the point of allowing anarchy and chaos to \nprevail over order. It is as if people know their own predilections for selfishness in their private \n\u2018market\u2019 and \u2018community\u2019 domains and deliberately accept the obligations of citizenship enacted \nthrough the state domain. They accept the state because they acknowledge their own propensity \nalong with those of others to otherwise free-ride. It is the qualified freedom of much bourgeois \npolitical philosophy. \n \nThe problem arises when permeability functions with the opposite effect and when alternative \nprinciples prevail: of privilege; of natural superiority of rights and entitlements; of selfishness; of \n 17 \nprivate short-term gain; of fission; of social closure. Here all the domestic components of the \nIRM exhibit failures. Markets are imperfect, communities clientelist and socially exclusive\n7\n, \nhouseholds patriarchal and states marketized and\/or patrimonial. Under such conditions, how \ndoes it make sense to expect the state to disentangle itself from deep social and political structures \nand function to compensate for them? As Poulantzas (1969) once put it, \u2018the state is a condensate \nof class relations\u2019. In this situation all are prisoners. The issue is whether the prison is worth \nliving in or not, and what functions it performs. But do not expect its west wing to \u2018compensate\u2019 \nfor its east wing! (Wood, 2000). We return to this issue in the final section. \n \n \n4. MAPPING WELFARE REGIMES \n \nWe adopt two methods to empirically ground this analysis. First, Gough (2004c) uses measures of \ntwo components of welfare regimes noted above\u2014welfare mix and welfare outcomes\u2014to \nundertake a simple cluster analysis of a large set of countries outside the OECD area. Second, our \ncollaborators researched and wrote detailed studies of three world regions (Latin America, East \nAsia, Africa) and one country within South Asia (Bangladesh). We summarize these in turn. \n \nThe cluster analysis aims to explore cross-national patterns of welfare mixes and welfare \noutcomes: unlike much regression analysis the goal is to reveal patterns of difference as much as \nrelations of similarity. We rely on commonly available data covering all the transitional, \nunderdeveloped and developing countries outside the OECD, though inevitably their validity, \nreliability and comparability are open to question. To keep the analysis simple, the exercise below \nuses just two indicators of the welfare mix and one measure of welfare outcomes. The former \ncombines the domestic state, international state and household components of the mix: (1) public \n 18 \nspending on health and education as a share of GDP; and (2) the sum of international inflows of \naid and remittances as a share of GNP. As an indicator of welfare outcomes we use the widely-\nknown HDI. Applying k-means cluster analysis yields four identifiable clusters, shown in Table 2 \nbelow. \n \n \nTable 2 here \n \n \nAt a very crude level of interpretation we may label these clusters as follows: \n \n1) Actual or potential welfare state regimes: with high state commitments and relatively high \nwelfare outcomes. This cluster includes much of Central Europe (with some representatives in \nEastern Europe); the southern cone of Latin America; Kenya, Algeria and Tunisia in Africa, and \nThailand. \n \n2) More effective informal security regimes: with relatively good outcomes achieved with below-\naverage state spending and low international flows. This includes parts of Southeast Asia, Sri \nLanka, the remaining countries of Latin America for which we have data, together with parts of \nthe Middle East.  \n \n3) Less effective informal security regimes: with poor levels of welfare coupled with low public \ncommitments and moderate international inflows. This cluster comprises South Asia (excluding \nSri Lanka) and certain countries in sub-Saharan Africa. \n \n 19 \n4) Externally dependent insecurity regimes: heavily dependent on aid and\/or remittances with \nvery poor welfare outcomes. This comprises the bulk of sub-Saharan Africa as revealed in \navailable data.  \n \nMore detailed description of regime types in different regions of the world can be summarized as \nfollows. \n \n \na) Bangladesh and South Asia \n \nIn the discussion of the informal security regime above, we recognize that there is a heavy \nreliance upon the community and family (or broader kin) to meet the need for security. In a \nhistorical sense, this reliance is in spite of a British colonial legacy which bequeathed several \nstates in South Asia with recognizable territories and competences. A formal system of law exists, \nand within India at least liberal democratic practices are also well-established. This has produced \na welfare regime combination of \u2018stateness\u2019 (with relative autonomy\u2014see Alavi, 1972) alongside \nabsent or uneven capitalist development and large scale rural and rising urban poverty. Under \nthese conditions, the state has also been characterized by widespread rent-seeking and corruption. \nBut the problem with the community and family locations in the South Asian IRM is that \nrelationships within them are typically hierarchical and asymmetrical, and indeed patriarchal. As \nWood has argued elsewhere (2003b), this asymmetry typically results in adverse incorporation \n(i.e. problematic inclusion rather than social exclusion) in which poorer people trade some short \nterm security in return for longer term vulnerability by adopting forms of client dependence. This \nreproduces underlying patron-client relations as a stratification outcome, and functions to disrupt \nthe arrival of civil society pressures to reform such precarious welfare relationships along welfare \n 20 \nstate lines. In the meantime, that short term security does provide certain informal rights which \nhave more immediate predictability and reliability than formal statutory ones. \n \nThe characteristics of a South Asian informal security regime within our framework is displayed \nwell in Bangladesh, where the global dimension of the welfare mix is particularly evident through \naid and remittances, alongside community level institutions (Davis, 2001, 2004). Welfare \noutcomes are generally poor and insecurity is endemic. The welfare mix in Bangladesh is much \nmore reliant on family, kinship, community, local government and \u2018civil society\u2019 forms of \nwelfare provision, which together establish some informal but nevertheless reasonably stable \nclaims to low level entitlement. In addition, the foreign aid community and other bilateral and \nglobal actors, as well as significant flows of external remittance income to a sub-set of families, \nmediate the welfare mix in critical ways. Aid dependency brings an external discourse about \nrights and correlative duties into the society, offering the policy objective of a welfare state \nregime via well governed and targeted state interventions underpinned by a growing economy \nalongside successful agrarian subsistence. However that model is difficult to establish or \nreproduce under conditions of elite capture of aid and continuing economic vulnerability to \nvolatile global markets, in which a new transparent settlement between rights and correlative \nduties, for example in the garments industry, cannot be realized without losing comparative \nadvantage. This is the contradictory fix for many similar societies.  \n \nUnder such conditions, deep social and political structures continue to define the relationship \nbetween rights and correlative duties as highly personalized, segmented, preferential, \ndiscretionary and clientelist, as patrons of various kinds\n8\n intermediate between the needs of poor \npeople (shelter, employment etc.) and the imperfect institutions in the state and market domains. \nPatron-clientelism provides some security of welfare, but it comes at the cost of adverse \nincorporation\u2014individual or collective\u2014which blocks more radical reform and the structuring of \n 21 \ndomestic interests within a welfare state discourse. Davis (2004) has argued that there is a lack of \na citizenship link between the foreign funding of development and social sector programs and \ntheir disbursement\n9\n. Moreover, a key class of potentially active citizens can exit from this \ndomestic regime, either via the purchase of overseas education and health services, or via \nmigration and remittances. All this blocks the emergence of a positive feedback link between \ncitizenship and public welfare provision, characteristic of western welfare states. Instead, the \ninformal security regime prevails, with de-clientelization rather than de-commodification as the \nprime task of social policy. \n \n \nb) Latin America \n \nLatin America reveals similar patterns of informalization of security but, in the more developed \ncountries at least, this coexists alongside a more extensive sector of state welfare. One reason for \nthis is much earlier decolonization and political independence together with the subsequent \nemergence of export economies and partial industrialization. This fostered a capitalist class and \nan urban proletariat alongside the land-owning class and a hard-pressed peasantry, manifesting \nproblems of vertical and horizontal integration. The inter-war global depression brought about a \nswitch from export economies to import substitution strategies. This fostered the emergence of \nsocial insurance and employment protection schemes for formal sector workers, endorsed by the \nstate. On this basis an alliance of industry, public sector workers and urban industrial workers \nemerged which acted to protect and extend these incipient welfare institutions. As a result, a \nwelfare regime emerged in post-war Latin America, most clearly in the more developed Southern \nCone, not unlike that of southern Europe. There were aspirations towards universal access in \nhealth and education. Social insurance and employment protection institutions provided a \nsubstantial degree of protection against risk for formal sector workers and their dependants. Small \n 22 \nwonder that some have characterized the Southern Cone countries as welfare states (Huber, \n1996). However, the dualized economy left the mass of informal sector workers (peasants, \nlandless laborers, urban unemployed and marginal workers) unprotected, reliant on unregulated \nlabor markets, residual public assistance programs and above all their own resources. Throughout \nthe region, household provision and livelihood mixing was important, and the private sector was \nnot clearly distinguished from the public. For this reason, Barrientos (2004) describes this as a \ncombined conservative-informal welfare regime\u2014with, in southern countries, an incipient \nconservative-informal welfare state regime. \n \nHe goes on to argue that this post-war Latin American regime type was substantially transformed \nduring the late 1970s and 1980s as import substitution (increasingly ill-adapted to the \nliberalization of trade, investment and finance) was replaced by export-oriented growth models as \na response to debt crises and the impositions of structural adjustment (Gwynne & Kay, 1999). \nWith such harsh modifications to the economy, corporatist and syndicalist politics gave way to \nauthoritarian political regimes (O\u2019Donnell, 1979). In the face of this combined onslaught the \npolitical constituency of industry, public sector and formal sector workers crumbled. As a result, \naccording to Barrientos (2004), by the 1990s the welfare regime began to shift to a liberal-\ninformal one. Employment protection withered in the face of labor market deregulation. Social \ninsurance began to be replaced by individual saving and market provision. The private financing \nand provision of health and education was encouraged. The state origins of protection were \nweakened, with workers of all kinds more exposed to informal sources of support. Looking to the \nfuture, the experience of instability and crisis during the last decade is stimulating the resurgence \nof political democracy across the region which might offer opportunities for new, perhaps more \ninclusive, social programs and forms of social development to emerge. Unlike South Asia, there \nis a tradition of extensive state-induced social policy to refer back to. \n \n 23 \n \nc) East Asia \n \nThe middle-income countries in East Asia\n10\n provide a radically different model of combined \ninformal and formal welfare, described as productivist welfare regimes. These regimes are based \non dynamic emerging capitalist market economies, which have driven the commodification of \nlabor over many decades under state guided pursuit of economic growth as the main policy goal, \nwith the emergence of marketized social welfare as a corollary. Moreover, they continue to be \ngoverned by unified, relatively strong states with substantial steering and infrastructural \ncapacities. They have pursued this developmental agenda with remarkable economic success. In \nthe absence of seriously unequal Latin American-style land and income distribution, attributable \nin part to post 2\nnd\n world war imposed land reform agendas, this growth has generated steadily \nimproving welfare outcomes (Gough, 2001, 2004a). \n \nThe term productivist welfare regime signals that the East Asian countries differ from the types of \nwelfare state regime identified in the West. First, social policy is not an autonomous agent in \nsociety or even an autonomous sphere of government; rather it is subordinated to the dominant \neconomic policy goal of maintaining high rates of economic growth. Following on from this, \nsocial policy is concentrated on social investment notably in education and basic health rather \nthan social protection. Third, this policy has largely been driven by the imperatives of nation-\nbuilding and regime legitimation. Fourth, the state is mainly confined to regulation rather than \nprovision and plays only a contributory role to the broader welfare mix, which is sustained by \nstrong families and household strategies, high savings and marketized provision and, in Korea, \nenterprise welfare.  \n \n 24 \nHowever, the sustainability of this regime and the threats to welfare are now open to doubt \nbecause of its vulnerability in the East Asian financial crisis of 1997 when the open economies of \nthe region were exposed to short-term inflows of hot money from the US and Japan which \nfinanced unsustainable bank lending and investment projects. The ultimate collapse of the Thai \nbaht triggered a currency and banking crisis with major impacts upon incomes, poverty and living \nstandards. As a result, the absence of social protection measures and the lack of social investment \nin higher education was exposed. The advent of democratization and sustained citizenship \ncampaigns coupled with greater international economic exposure has driven the governments of \nKorea and Taiwan to develop incipient welfare states, albeit of a distinct productivist bent. It \nremains to be seen whether this sets a pattern for the transformation of the productivist social \ndevelopment regimes elsewhere in the region.  \n \n \nd) Stretching the typology: insecurity regimes \n \nSome commentators\n11\n are prone to divide the world\u2019s 6 billion population into three parts in the \nratio 1:4:1. The first billion enjoy the wealth and security of rich developed countries (not to deny \npoverty within them, but to see it as easily solvable with present institutions); the next 4 billion \nare improving societies, with poverty declining and social capital slowly transforming informal \nsecurity; but the final 1 billion will remain as the main target of development aid for at least the \nfirst half of the 21\nst\n century.  \n \nThis final one billion is significantly concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, which has been \ncharacterized by Bevan (2004b) as a regional insecurity regime with high uncertainty, and clearly \nrepresenting problems of vertical and horizontal integration. She develops a generic model of \n\u2018in\/security\u2019 regimes (Bevan, 2004a) which has more relevance to peripheral, dangerous and \n 25 \npowerless zones of the world system, not only in sub-Saharan Africa (see Figure 2). Here the very \nessence of the nation-state is itself contested, partly as a result of colonial history and post-\ncolonial settlements which transgressed other, competing, primordial loyalties and identities. But \nthese are also zones which are not articulated into the global political economy as national \neconomies, and which thereby experience highly unregulated market conditions and collusions \nwith foreign capital, mediated by patron, warlord and comprador economic agents. Weak states \nare therefore open to powerful external forces ranging from the world powers, through external \ngovernmental organizations, transnational corporations, international NGOs, to criminal \nnetworks. These interact with local patrons to reinforce patronage relationships, resulting either in \nprecarious adverse incorporation and dependence of the population; or the exclusion of groups \nfrom any form of livelihood and welfare and their consequent destruction. The result is a \ncombination of: predatory capitalism; variegated forms of oppression; inadequate, insecure \nlivelihoods; shadow, collapsed and\/or criminal states; diffuse and fluid forms of political \nmobilization reproducing adverse incorporation and exclusion; and political fluidity if not \noutright chaos. The outcomes have been deteriorating health, denial of education and rising \npoverty in many areas. Superimposed on this, in many parts of the subcontinent, the HIV-AIDS \npandemic and\/or war and civil conflict have generated extreme levels of suffering.  \n \nThe pursuit of secure welfare in these circumstances can presume none of the institutional \nperformance labels, which apply to the other two families of welfare regime. Insecurity regimes \nthus exhibit a far more tenuous relationship between rights and correlative duties, seeing survival \nmechanisms as more transient and contingent upon the particular alliances fabricated by power-\nholders. Thus the poor have to adapt continuously, negotiating short term solutions to welfare in \nthe absence of longer term ones. This is a world of unstable and frequently violent fission and \nfusion in which the pursuit of secure welfare is virtually divorced from any recognizable sense of \nsocial policy. Reaching poor people with weakened personal social resources in these \n 26 \ncircumstances of dysfunctional social capital and weak public goods becomes more of a relief \nprocess than even a rehabilitation one. \n \nFurthermore, one may question, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, whether the regime label can \nbe confined to the national level. Bevan argues that major areas of Africa resemble more an open \nfield of play for powerful external interests. Many states are \u2018incoherent\u2019 in two senses: they are \nnot institutionally differentiated from the societies within which they are embedded, and they lack \nmeaningful territorial borders. As a result, the external players intrude into and enmesh with \ndomestic elites in a novel and menacing way. This can enhance the power of the military, \ncriminals and informal elites in ways which establish a perverted form of path dependency. The \nWorld Bank and the IMF, recently converted to pro-poor growth, now earnestly wish to reverse \nthis downward spiral, but this entails confronting the results of past international involvements.  \n \nTo summarize this description of sub-Saharan Africa and regions with similar conditions, the \nstrongest test of a regime analysis, there are systemic patterns in the interaction between \nindividuals and institutions. The overwhelming reliance on individuals in households generates \ngross insecurity and poor levels of need satisfaction. The emergence of stable informal \nmechanisms at some kind of community level is blocked by the predatory behavior of actors \nwithin the state and market corners of the IRM, including internationally. Thus powerful external \nplayers interact with weak internal actors to generate conflict and political instability. These \nregimes spill over national boundaries, which have been weakly constructed in the face of \nalternatively enduring solidarities and identities, based on ethnicity, language and religion\u2014i.e. \nproblematic horizontal integration. Under such conditions, governments cannot play even a \nvestigial governance and security-enhancing role. The outcome is a vicious circle of insecurity, \nvulnerability and suffering for all but a small elite and their enforcers and clients. Pockets of \nsocial development and African success stories qualify but do not alter this conclusion.  \n 27 \n \n \nPutting together the cluster analysis and regional case-studies we tentatively propose the \nfollowing taxonomy of welfare regimes across the globe; see Figure 2.\n12\n  \n \nFigure 2 here \n \n \n5. DE-CLIENTELIZATION \n \nWe are arguing, from a wider comparative welfare regime perspective, that significant parts of \nthe world are characterized by informal security and insecurity regimes, much more reliant upon \nunorganized community or organized aspects of civil society. Thus the principal focus for social \npolicy has to shift from de-commodification towards de-clientelization. If informal arrangements \nwithin the community are characterized by patron-clientelism, we must then look to de-\nclientelization as the basis of improving the quality of rights and correlative duties. This term is \ndeliberately etymologically constructed as a conceptual alternative to de-commodification. It \nrefers to the process of de-linking client dependents from their personalized, arbitrary and \ndiscretionary entrapment to persons with intimate power over them. There is a need to dis-\nestablish clientelist forms of representation and provisioning and establish more formal rights to \nwelfare and security.  Institutionalized micro-credit has been a classic widespread attempt at de-\nlinking poor people from rapacious and usurious moneylenders. Mutual assurance societies, \ncooperatives, trades unions and other civil society forms of mobilization are all contributors to the \nprinciple of de-clientalization. In this argument, social movements of empowerment become a \nprecondition for the evolution of a statutory rights-based social policy.\n13\n The central problem for \n 28 \npoor people is whether they can risk such a process of de-clientelization if the alternatives are \nunknown and uncertain. A policy of de-clientelization can only be ethically contemplated if the \nprocesses that achieve this outcome also offer alternative welfare functions, effectively delivered. \nThis is a tall order.  \n \nWhat then are the implications of our analysis for social policy in the South? If social policy is \nthe public pursuit of secure welfare, we must first dwell upon the meaning of public action. To \ncircumvent a long history of debate on this subject, we begin with an account of social policy in \nthe West as the product of a dual movement: pressures from below and reforms from above \n(Gough, 1979, ch. 1). We consider each in turn before considering the implications for social \nreforms in development contexts. \n \nIt is no coincidence that welfare state regimes in western industrial societies evolved alongside \nthe proletarianization of labor. As we learn from Marx, mature capitalism brings about the social \nconditions under which alienation becomes a shared experience and labor can be organized to \nconfront or remedy that alienation. Thus the forms of public action that brought about the \n\u2018welfare state\u2019 included struggles of the increasingly organized labor movement. In many \nnorthern European countries, these developments were linked to a range of other class \nmobilizations, notably by agricultural workers and later the \u2018service class\u2019, other social \nmovements (such as the temperance movement in Scandinavia), and self-help institutions, such as \nFriendly Societies in Britain. Thus concessions were progressively wrung from the bourgeois \nstate through public action. \n \nOn the other hand, social policies have also been introduced from the top down by far-sighted \nelites exhibiting \u2018enlightened self-interest\u2019, recognizing the various \u2018functions\u2019 that social policies \ncan perform and their beneficial results for accumulation, legitimacy and stability to pursue their \n 29 \nown interests. \u2018Stable inequality\u2019 (Tilly, 1999) can only be achieved if poverty is somehow \nmanaged either through meaningful chances of upward mobility or through moderated \nexploitation. This is also the \u2018public goods\u2019 argument for social reform, whether public health \nmeasures to control epidemics, social programs (alongside social control) to prevent runaway \ncrime and physical insecurity, schooling for skills and citizenship, or housing and town planning \nto counter the social costs of unplanned urbanization. \u2018Concessionary capitalism\u2019 tends to \nformalize some public goods as social rights in order for stable inequality to persist. \n \nWhat are the chances of similar mechanisms taking hold in the South and transforming informal \ninto formal welfare regimes? First, can we expect serious, sustained and effective bottom-up \npressure from organized labor? Outside a few areas, no; so we have to search for public action in \nother quarters. How, then, do we assess the claims made across the world for a civil society \nalternative? We certainly need to be wary of much rhetoric from the official bilateral agencies \nand the international financial institutions. In this rhetoric, the good governance agenda is \ncombined with optimism about participatory social action as the means to improve public \ninstitutional performance, poverty-focused policy implementation, and community based social \ndevelopment.  \n \nYet, there is some contrast of judgment between gloomy academics on the one hand (Wood, \n2000; Cooke & Kothari, 2001) and the evidence of widespread NGO\/Civil Society movements \noperating at local, national and global levels with increasing sophistication as lobbyists and \npressure groups. The \u2018de Tocqueville\u2019 understanding of civil society as critical and independent, \nable to exert restraining pressure upon the state (Davis & McGregor, 2000), confronts the \nhegemonic pessimists.\n14\n At the same time, the preoccupation with hegemony overlooks the many \nsmall gains made by civil society action, social movements and collective action. With some \nfinite exceptions, states cannot rule for long by coercion alone. Concessions to struggle are made, \n 30 \nrights do get extended, policies do get changed, reforms do happen. Perhaps the hegemonic \npessimists have simply been too impatient and have not attributed enough significance to small \nvictories. In examining the hegemonic implications of authoritative labeling, Wood (1985) also \npoints out that \u2018targets strike back\u2019. In other words, the ways in which the state might seek to \norganize and re-organize its population for convenient, limited policy concessions can itself \nproduce new solidarities and social bases for critical social action\u2014a process of extended, or \ndynamic reproduction.  \n \nOne way or another, the achievement has been to organize solidarities outside the category of \norganized labor. Post-class analysis has drawn our attention to these possibilities as identities and \ninterest groups outside the historic capital-labor confrontation have emerged as significant. This \nhas been reinforced by the evidence from transforming, recently agrarian, societies where \npeasants, quasi peasants, tenants, landless agricultural labor, informal sector workers, migrants, \nand women from these categories have been mobilized in the \u2018reformist\u2019 era following the great \n\u2018peasant\u2019 revolutions associated with Russia, China, Mexico, Vietnam inter alia (Webster & \nEngberg-Pedersen, 2002). \n \nTurning to top-down reforms, elites in the South typically have contradictory relationships to the \nstate. Some are definitely part of the problem of the state, while others lament its irresponsibility. \nFrom experience in South Asia and Latin America, it is clear than even well connected elites have \ninsufficient trust in the state to commit to it wholeheartedly. Typically, a desire for public goods \ncoexists with an unwillingness to collectively invest in them, resulting in widespread tax \navoidance and evasion. It also results in public squalor alongside private\u2014and privately \nprotected\u2014wealth. A social policy agenda in poor countries has to include converting the elite\u2019s \nobjective interest in, and frequent desire for, public goods into corresponding public action to \ndeliver them. In other words it needs to pursue a regime change, in which the elite\u2019s correlative \n 31 \nduties are expanded in response to rights claimed by others. In a nutshell, the transformation of \ninformal security regimes into welfare state regimes entails a subtle and complex process of de-\nclientelization.  \n \nFinally, the transformation of insecurity regimes into even informal security regimes requires \nmore basic preconditions: stable, legitimate states with some minimal jurisdiction over their \nterritories; international curbs on the actions of threatening outside actors and regulation of global \nmarkets; and moves to enhance civil society and norms of governance. Some of this agenda is \nnow embraced by the World Bank and aid agencies, but as Gore (2000) argues, this paradigm is \ncontradictory and thus na\u00efve. The discourse of normative standards at the international level (such \nas the Millennium Goals) does not displace the responsibilities of national governments. Yet the \nsevere and intensifying international constraints on nation states are barely recognized. If, \nhowever, as we argue, international factors and actors must be fully integrated into the analysis, \nthen the prospects for countries in unstable zones to improve on their insecurity regimes are \ndependent on changes in the global architecture of nations and institutions. \n \n \n6. CONCLUSION \n \nOur argument implies a moral hierarchy of regime types on a continuum from \u2018insecurity\u2019 to \n\u2018informal insecurity\u2019 to \u2018formal security\u2019. There can be no doubt that such a formulation poses a \ntheoretical dilemma. Are we simply repeating a liberal modernization mantra and in effect \nunfavorably contrasting traditional with modern social arrangements? Not really. On the one \nhand, we have indicated that we are sensitive to history, colonialism and neo-colonialism, and \npersistent conditions of unequal exchange in the global political economy. We are acknowledging \n 32 \npath dependency and not assuming that globalization reproduces a homogeneity of modern social \nsystems. On the other hand, we do claim that the \u2018formal security\u2019 of welfare (in the sense of \nindividual, guaranteed, non-personal and justiciable rights independent of birth, wealth, gender, \nstatus or other ascribed characteristics) is the most satisfactory way of meeting universal human \nneeds including those for security. That condition must be better for most people than either the \nclientelist, though partially protected, conditions of \u2018informal security\u2019, and certainly better than \nthe persistent instability and violence of \u2018insecurity\u2019 regime types. \n  \nYet we are not suggesting a global program of catching up. We are not suggesting for the \nforeseeable future (i.e. at least during the lifetime of the Millennium Development Goals) that the \nwelfare regimes of poor countries can somehow be transformed into the welfare state ones of the \nWest, or even that this would be desirable. That would be to deny path dependency and to be \ninsensitive to the different historical ways in which societies and geographic zones are \nrepresented within globalization, and as a result are able to construct different welfare mixes. \nImprovements towards formal security have to be judged in each situation according to its \nparticular circumstances, and we have to be realistic rather than utopian. \n \nThis middle-range regime approach enables us to retain a universalism about ends while being \nrelativist about means.\n15\n This relativism essentially reflects the basic ways in which poverty needs \nto be understood in different sets of societies, leading to the conceptual basis for defining \nappropriate security of welfare, and the institutional room for maneuver in any meaningful \ntimeframe. This relativism certainly requires us to box more clever in considering the repertoire \nof social policy initiatives by a wider range of actors in the public domain, not confined to the \nstate. This is the basic contrast with Western social policy. The relationships between rights and \ncorrelative duties have to be sought more subtly and supported in ways which do not presume the \nabsolute authority of the state and which respect the sustainable contribution of other agencies.  \n 33 \nNotes \n                                                          \n1\n Cf.

For them, childhood security, physical and economic security are intermediate needs \ncontributing to these basic needs.  \n3\n This feature poses immediate problems for the biggest developed country of all\u2014the United States\u2014\nwhere 45 million lack health insurance and two million, mostly poor and black, are in prison. Is this a \nwelfare state or a \u2018carceral state\u2019? \n4\n See Collard (2000) for an analysis of the inter-generational bargain. \n5\n This method resembles an Althusserian Marxist approach which conceives of a social formation \nembracing several co-existing modes of production, but identifies the formation with the dominant mode of \nproduction in a particular epoch (Brenner, 1977).  \n6\n Indeed, it is this Polanyian assumption which underpins the de-commodification basis of Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s welfare state regime approach. \n7\n And of course, racially, ethnically and linguistically too\u2014the problem of horizontal integration. \n8\n Urban broker-patrons or \u2018touts\u2019 are known in Bengali as mastaan. \n9\n This has long been argued by nationalists in Bangladesh. They consider that the high dependence on aid \nhas weakened voice and civil society development in the country. \n10\n With the exception of the Philippines and excluding consideration of China. \n11\n For example, Paul Collier (at the Centre for the Study of African Economies, University of Oxford, and \nrecently Director of the Development Research Group at the World Bank) argued in these terms at a \nseminar at St. Anthony\u2019s, Oxford, in October 2003. \n12\n But this excludes the Middle East and North Africa and some other sub-regions of the world. \n13\n This could be understood as a bottom-up process of realizing an Hegelian objective of political order, \nseeking to overcome problems of vertical and horizontal integration as the precondition for rights-based \nwelfare. \n 34 \n                                                                                                                                                                             \n14\n For example: Gramscian arguments about civil society incorporated into the state\u2019s project; in the \nseventies, Althusser\u2019s \u2018ideological state apparatuses\u2019; and the critical theory of Habermas, Marcuse and \nothers associated with the Frankfurt School. \n15\n In the contemporary world, Gough (2004b) has recently argued, the opposite pertains, due to the \ncombined influence of post-modern denials of universal conceptions of human well-being and one-size-\nfits-all policy recommendations by global agencies. \u2018In this topsy-turvy world, core values and needs are \nrelative and local, while means and policies are global and universal\u2019 (p. 291). \n 35 \nREFERENCES \n \n \n \nAlavi, H.
