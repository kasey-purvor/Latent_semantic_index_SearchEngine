INTRODUCTION\nTHERE is a rapidly growing interest in the field of large-area electronics or macroelectronics. This is because elec-\ntronic circuits and systems over large areas have a direct impact\non the man-machine interface whether it be a roll-up flexible\ndisplay on a plastic substrate, a body imager, wearable elec-\ntronics, or programmable wall coverings [1], [2]. In general,\ndeposition of semiconductor films used to make electronic\ncircuits has to be carried out at low temperatures to preserve the\nintegrity of the substrate. As a result, inorganic semiconductors\nare amorphous or microcrystalline. Organic semiconductors\nare deposited at low temperatures [3]\u2013[5], but these too are\nhighly disordered. The poor quality of these semiconductor\nlayers leads to low circuit speed and electrical instability which\nseriously limits the applicability of present macroelectronic\ncircuits and systems. The basic building block of all circuits\nis the transistor. Here, we address the general question of how\nto make high-performance transistors in semiconductor layers\nthat are defective, have low carrier mobilities and are unstable.\nAlso, we show that by getting away from the only thin-film\ntransistor used today, the field-effect transistor (FET), and using\na barrier controlled source-gated structure, we can mitigate\nagainst the effects of low mobility and substantially improve\nstability. This is because the excess carrier concentration in a\nManuscript received April 19, 2006; revised September 13, 2006.

In addition, these transistors in disordered\nsemiconductors are likely to be more stable.\nII. DISORDERED AND POOR-QUALITY SEMICONDUCTORS\nThin-film semiconductors used in macroelectronics range\nfrom inorganic semiconductors, such as hydrogenated amor-\nphous silicon, amorphous oxides [6], and metal chalcogenides\n[4], [7], to organic polymers and plastics and organic\u2013inorganic\nhybrid semiconductors [8]. All these materials are either amor-\nphous or microcrystalline semiconductors containing a high\nconcentration of defects.\nThe effect of disorder and impurities in thin-film semicon-\nductors is to introduce a wide range of defects in the band\ngap. These range from states caused by bond angle and bond\nlength variations, coordination defects in amorphous materials,\nand grain boundary defects in microcrystalline materials [9].\nDefects are characterized by both positional and energetic\ndisorder, and contribute to a distribution of states across the\nband gap which increases sharply toward the band edges. It has\nbeen concluded by Stutzmann [9] that defect formation under\ncharge injection is a general phenomenon in disordered semi-\nconductors. Occupation of localized defect states, such as the\nweakly bound states in band tails, leads to structural relaxation\nand defect formation. The assumption is that states are created\nin the disordered network to minimize excess charge carriers in\nstrained or weak bonds. In hydrogenated amorphous silicon, for\nexample, occupation of weak silicon\u2013silicon bonds by electrons\ncauses them to break, leaving silicon dangling bond defect\nstates deep in the band gap with the process mediated by\nhydrogen [9], [10]. Defects continue to be generated until the\nmaterial reaches a new chemical equilibrium corresponding to\nthe new position of the electron quasi-Fermi level leading to\nsevere instability.\nFermi-level dependent defect generation is also expected in\npolymer semiconductors. Here, as well as localized states due\nto disorder, we have self-localization of injected carriers. This\nleads to structural distortion and the formation of defect states\nin the band gap [11]. Furthermore, the coulombic interaction\nbetween carriers or between ionized dopants and charge carriers\ncreates deep states and broadens the distribution of tail states\n[12]. Therefore, the more excess carriers we have, more carriers\nare there in localized states, the greater is the magnitude of the\ninstabilities and faster these changes occur. We deduce from\nStutzmann\u2019s work [9] that to minimize the defect formation\n0018-9383\/$25.00 \u00a9 2007 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Structure of a (a) FET and (b) SGT and the differences in key parameters that determine device performance. The electron concentration (c) and (d) and\nthe electric field (e) and (f) are calculated along the semiconductor-insulator interface for a given drain current (4.10\u22128 A\/um), tS = 100-nm a-Si:H, tI = 300-nm\nSiN. The source-barrier height for the SGT is 0.45 eV, source length is 2 \u00b5m, and L = d = 1.5 \u00b5m.\nwhen a transistor is switched on, we must design and operate\na transistor such that the excess carrier concentration is low\nthroughout the device.\nAnother key transistor parameter is the carrier mobility.\nIncreasing the degree of disorder in inorganic semiconductors\nreduces carrier mobility because carriers spend more of their\ntime in localized states and transport occurs via hopping or\ntunneling between states leading to low effective mobilities.\nSimilarly in polymers charge transport is by hopping in a\ndisordered system [13] with a mobility that seems to be related\nin a complicated and unresolved manner to charge density and\nfilm morphology [14]. A low carrier mobility is therefore a\nbasic property of hopping transport, and there is not very much\nwe can do about it. However, carrier velocities can be increased\nby operating with high internal fields. If we wish to maximize\nthe speed of a transistor, then it should be designed and operated\nso that there are high fields throughout the active region of the\ndevice and this region should have small dimensions. Further-\nmore, in some cases, the mobility itself increases with electric\nfield, thus enabling even higher carrier velocities to be obtained\n[12], [15], [16].\nBased on these considerations, we conclude that to make\nstable transistors with a useful frequency response, we have to:\n1) reduce the carrier concentration and 2) operate with high\ninternal fields throughout the active part of a transistor with\nsmall dimension. Condition 1) improves the device stability and\nreduces device capacitance by lowering carrier concentrations,\nwhile condition 2) improves carrier transit time and speed of\nresponse by increasing carrier velocity over small distances.\nIII. THIN-FILM TRANSISTORS\nTo date, all transistors used in macroelectronics are of the\nmetal\u2013insulator field-effect type (FET), in which a gate is\nused to modulate the conductance between a source and drain\ncontact [17]. This transistor has acceptable characteristics for\nless-demanding applications. However, there is a problem with\nthe FET in the context of requirements mentioned above. The\nsource end of the channel is strongly accumulated with excess\ncarriers when the transistor is switched ON, and this strong\naccumulation is accompanied by low electric fields.\nRecently, a different type of unipolar thin-film transistor\nwas introduced, named a source-gated transistor [18] (SGT),\nin which the source comprises a potential barrier to current\nflow and a gate is used to modulate the electric field at the\nreverse-biased source barrier and change the current. A major\ndifference between the SGT and a FET is that a reverse-\nbiased source barrier controls the current in the ON-state and\ncurrent saturation is determined by the electrostatics at the\nsource barrier [19] rather than pinch-off at the drain end of a\nchannel. In addition, the geometry of the SGT leads to a much\nsmaller susceptibility to short-channel effects and a higher\noutput impedance because the source barrier is screened from\nthe drain field by the gate [19], [20].

The SGT devices in curve (\u0001) had d \u223c 1.5 \u00b5m as in the simulation (Fig. 1)\nand were stressed with high drain voltages. The dashed curve is that expected\nhad the source drain separation of the FET been 2 \u00b5m since ID is proportional\nto 1\/L. The measurements were normalized to a device width of 12 \u00b5m.\ncontext of our requirements for high-performance transistors in\npoor-quality semiconductors is that the carrier concentration in\nthe source region is low and there are high fields sweeping the\ncarriers away toward the drain. Furthermore, these transistors\noperate very well with small dimensions.\nThe basic differences in geometry of the FET and SGT are\nshown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). The FET has ohmic source and\ndrain contacts separated by a gap L. The gate lies under this gap\nand is able to modulate the conductance of the semiconductor\nbetween the contacts. In the SGT, the source is a potential\nbarrier to current transport and the drain is assumed to be\nohmic. The gate lies under the source barrier and extends under\nthe source\u2013drain separation d to the drain contact. Although\na doped layer is used to make a drain ohmic contact, it is\nnot essential. When the transistor is switched on, the current\nin the FET [Fig. 1(a)] is determined by the conductivity of\nthe channel between source and drain contacts, while for the\nSGT [Fig. 1(b)], it is determined by the emission over the\nsource-barrier contact [21], and the channel forms a parasitic\nresistance. Most of the SGT current flows at the periphery of\nthe source barrier opposite to the drain [22].\nIV. MEASUREMENTS AND MODELING OF\nTRANSISTORS IN a-Si:H\nTo compare the performance of these structures, we have\nmeasured and modeled transistors in hydrogenated amorphous\nsilicon (a-Si:H). This semiconductor is highly defective and\nnotoriously unstable [23]. It is therefore a good example of\na poor-quality semiconductor. Furthermore, all the parameters\nrequired for modeling of device behavior are known [23]. The\nvalues of the main electrical parameters used in this analysis\nare given in [22]. Simulations of the two devices using the\ntwo-dimensional Silvaco Atlas device simulator (v.8.10.0.R)\nshow that the carrier concentration in the source region in the\nSGT [Fig. 1(c) and (d)] is very much smaller which is to be\nexpected, because the source is reverse biased and the a-Si:H\nunder the source is depleted. For this example, the reduction\nat the edge of the source where most of the current flows in the\nFig. 3. Comparison between measured and simulated transistor characteristics\n(a) SGT and (b) FET (tS = 100-nm a-Si:H, tI = 300-nm SiN).\nSGT is\u223c100 at high drain voltages. Furthermore, excess carrier\nconcentration decreases with increasing drain voltage.\nMeasurements of the stability of FETs and SGTs with the\nsame insulator and a-Si:H depositions to that simulated in Fig. 1\nare shown in Fig. 2. Transistors were made using the process\ndescribed in [19]. The source was a Cr Schottky barrier backed\nup with Al. The effective Schottky barrier height was controlled\nusing a phosphorous donor implant. The gate and drain voltages\nwere kept constant during stressing for 24 h at 30 \u25e6C at the\nvalues needed to give the current ID0 at time (t) = 0. It is\nseen that at the highest currents, the SGT is very much more\nstable than the FET. At high drain voltages (VD > VG\u2212VT )\nand with small source\u2013drain separations, the change of current\nis < 2% which is quite remarkable. Under these conditions,\nthe electron concentration is lowered not only under the source\nbut throughout the device, as can be seen in the simulations\nshown in Fig. 1(d). These measurements confirm that just\nas can be deduced from Stutzmann\u2019s work, reducing carrier\nconcentrations decreases the defect formation and the SGT is\nvery much more stable than an equivalent FET. Alternatively,\nwe can say that for a given stability, the SGT can be operated at\na higher current.\nAs discussed above, the way to obtain a good frequency\nresponse for a given geometry despite having a low carrier\nmobility is to operate with high internal fields over short\ndistances to reduce carrier transit times combined with low\ncarrier concentrations for low capacitance. The simulations in\nFig. 1(e) and (f) show that the electric field along the interface\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Comparison between a measured and simulated SGT transient re-\nsponses. For (a) the source barrier is 0.49 eV, source length is 4 \u00b5m, and\nd = 6 \u00b5m (tS = 100-nm a-Si:H, tI = 300-nm SiN). For (b) the source-barrier\nheight is 0.4 eV and d = 1.5 \u00b5m (tS = 40-nm a-Si:H, tI = 120-nm SiN).\nfor the SGT at the edge of the source, where most of the\ncurrent flows [22], is as much as six times greater than in\nthe corresponding FET. It is also apparent from Fig. 1(c) and\n(d) that the SGT is more tolerant to short channel effects. At\nhigh drain voltages, the FET is in punchthrough and the carrier\nconcentration is affected right up to the source ohmic contact.\nThis causes a deterioration in the output characteristics. In the\nSGT, however, the current is limited by the source barrier;\ntherefore, at high drain voltages, the carrier concentration at\nthe source is unaffected. This feature of the SGT enables it to\noperate with much smaller source\u2013drain separations.\nThe frequency response of the SGT and FET structures can\nbe ascertained using the Atlas device simulator provided, of\ncourse, that the simulation is reasonably accurate. A compar-\nison between simulated characteristics and those measured on\nSGT and FET devices is shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). It is\nseen that there is a good agreement between the shape of the\ncharacteristics and how the current changes with gate voltage.\nThe field effect mobility is \u223c0.4 cm2\/V \u00b7 s. Furthermore, the\nsimulated transient response for a SGT [Fig. 4(a) and (b)]\nalso shows good agreement with measurements. In addition,\ndespite having large dimensions, this SGT is able to respond\nat frequencies close to 1 MHz. Transient response simulations\nof a device with thinner layers and a lower source-barrier\nheight to increase transconductance perform well above 1 MHz\nFig. 5. Comparison of (a) SGT and (b) FET output characteristics for short\nsource\u2013drain separations. Source-barrier height is 0.35 eV, source length is\n1 \u00b5m, L = d = 250 nm (tS = 40-nm a-Si:H, tI = 120-nm SiN).\n[Fig. 4(b)] with a cutoff frequency (fT ) of 5 MHz. Decreasing\nthe source barrier further or increasing the gate voltage will\nincrease fT until it becomes transit time limited at \u223c20 MHz.\nIn comparison, an equivalent FET becomes transit time limited\nat \u223c15 MHz because of lower internal fields. To obtain even\nhigher frequencies, we need to shrink the lateral dimensions and\nreduce carrier transit times. In the limit, however, the maximum\nthat can be obtained is determined by short channel effects\nand the ability to preserve transistor characteristics. Simulations\nshow that the SGT [Fig. 5(a)] is much less sensitive to short\nchannel effects compared with a FET [Fig. 5(b)]. While the\nSGT has a good ON-characteristics with strong saturation, the\ncorresponding characteristics of the FET are very poor and of\nlittle use. The presence of a source barrier, even a small one also\nimproves the blocking state as can be seen from Fig. 5 at VG =\n0 V. Since the source barrier is a maximum for VG < 0 V, a\nhigh ON to OFF current ratio can be obtained especially when\nthe unmodulated source barrier is high. The SGT simulation\ngave an fT \u223c 25 MHz at VD = 10 V. The electric field EX was\n> 3 \u00d7 105 V\/cm throughout the active device giving a transit-\ntime limit > 100 MHz.\nV.

The low carrier concentration\nreduces the change in the carrier quasi-Fermi level between ON\nand OFF states of the transistors and improves stability while\nhigh internal fields increase the carrier velocity and mitigates\nagainst low carrier mobility.\nIt is shown that compared with a standard FET, the SGT more\nnearly meets these requirements, and it is demonstrated using\na-Si:H that the source-gated concept leads to thin-film transis-\ntors with excellent stability and good frequency response in un-\nstable semiconductors with low mobilities.
