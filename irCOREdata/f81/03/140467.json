There has been considerable\nemphasis on identifying the different sources of uncertainty associated with mycotoxin\nconcentration estimations, but much less on identifying the effect of the spatial location of the\nsampling points. This study used a two-dimensional statistical modelling approach to produce\ndetailed information on appropriate sampling strategies for surveillance of mycotoxins in raw\nfood commodities. The emphasis was on deoxynivalenol (DON) and ochratoxin A (OTA) in\nlarge lots of grain in storage or bulk transport. The aim was to simulate a range of plausible\ndistributions of mycotoxins in grain from a set of parameters characterising the distributions.\nFor this purpose, a model was developed to generate data sets which were repeatedly sampled\nto investigate the effect that sampling strategy and the number of incremental samples has on\ndetermining the statistical properties of mycotoxin concentration. Results showed that for\nmost sample sizes, a regular grid proved to be more consistent and accurate in the estimation\nof the mean concentration of DON, which suggests that regular sampling strategies should be\npreferred to random sampling, where possible. For both strategies, the accuracy of the\nestimation of the mean concentration increased significantly up to sample sizes of 40\u201360\n(depending on the simulation). The effect of sample size was small when it exceeded 60\npoints, which suggests that the maximum sample size required is of this order. Similar\nconclusions about the sample size apply to OTA, although the difference between regular and\nrandom sampling was small and probably negligible for most sample sizes.\nKeywords\nGeostatistical modelling; deoxynivalenol; ochratoxin A; bulk; cereals; sample size; sampling\nstrategy.\nIntroduction\nFor consumer health to be effectively protected it is important that consumer exposure\nto natural toxic contaminants in food, such as mycotoxins, is minimised. The ability to obtain\na representative sample for analysis, from a raw material or processed product, is critical as\npart of a prevention strategy. Previous studies have proved that designing sampling plans for\nmycotoxins is particularly problematical because of the heterogeneous distribution of these\ncontaminants in bulk lots of different commodities (Stroka et al., 2004, Schatzki, 1995a and\n1995b and Jewers et al., 1988). Because mycotoxin sampling is time-consuming and\nexpensive, a limited number of samples are taken to obtain an estimate of the mean\nconcentration. Normal practice is to take several small quantities of the commodity, known as\nincremental samples, from different locations (European Commission, 2005). These are\nmixed together to form the aggregate sample, from which a portion is extracted for analysis.\nIn this paper, the process of collecting several incremental samples is referred to as sampling,\nthe set of discrete incremental samples is called the sample, and the number of incremental\nsamples is the sample size.\nPrevious studies have looked at the complexities associated with the estimation of the\nmean mycotoxin concentration in bulk commodities. For example, Johansson et al. (2006)\nlooked at the distribution of fumonisin and aflatoxin concentration in maize. They divided\ntest maize samples into damaged kernels, whole kernels and other materials and found that\ntoxins were concentrated in the poor quality components. As a result, they suggested that\nanalyses in smaller samples of poor quality components of the sample provided a better\nprediction of the level of these mycotoxins in the bulk lot. Whitaker (2003) investigated the\nsources of error in the mycotoxin test procedure for aflatoxin in raw shelled peanuts and\ndescribed it as the combination of number of errors including at sampling, sample preparation\nmethod, and analytical method stages. In his study, the sampling step was identified as the\nlargest source of error. Other studies have looked at the coefficients of variation in relation to\nsampling, sample preparation and analysis for different aflatoxins (Whitaker, 2004, Whitaker\n2006 and Whitaker and Wiser, 1969) and proved that the type of commodity affects the\nvariation in percentage error at the sampling stage. Coker et al. (1995) reviewed the\ncomplexities associated with the design of sampling plans for different commodity types,\nsample composition, sample preparation method, analytical sample and batch acceptance\nlevel. Their review concluded that approximately 100 incremental samples are required to\nobtain a 10 kg representative aggregate sample in commodities composed of large particles.\nFor oilseed cakes and meal, fifty incremental samples are sufficient to obtain a representative\n5 kg aggregate sample. Miraglia et al. (2005) identified another source of error associated\nwith the sampling steps. They divided the sampling procedure into primary and secondary\nsampling. The primary sampling focuses on determining where, why and when to take\nsamples along the food chain. The secondary sampling aims at determining and establishing\nhow samples should actually be collected, and more importantly how many samples to take\nto obtain a representative sample. Other studies have identified the difficulties of sampling\nthe spatial aggregation of plant disease and have proposed different methodologies to address\nthis limitation (Maanen and Xu, 2003). Macarthur et al. (2006) identified the need to design\nadequate sampling programmes that take into account the heterogeneity in the spatial\ndistribution of mycotoxins so that decisions on acceptance\/rejection of contaminated lots are\nmore accurate. Whitaker (2006) discussed methods to reduce sampling error and stated that\nthese methods should focus on defining the number of samples required to obtain a specific\nlevel of confidence on the mean mycotoxin concentration and on determining the location of\nthe samples to be taken so the likelihood of detecting the mycotoxins is maximised.\nThere has been considerable emphasis on identifying the different sources of\nuncertainty associated with mycotoxin concentration estimations, but much less on\ndeveloping the statistical basis for robust sampling plans that account for the spatial\ndistribution of the mycotoxins in bulk commodities. Recent studies (Rivas Casado et al.,\n2009 and Parsons et al., 2007) have looked at the potential of geostatistics to characterise the\nspatial distribution of deoxynivalenol (DON) and ochratoxin A (OTA). Results showed that\nwhile no spatial structure could be identified for OTA due to its random occurrence,\ngeostatistics was a useful tool to describe the spatial distribution of DON. Some studies have\nsuccessfully looked at the application of geostatistics to characterise the spatial structure of\nApergillus flavus in soil (Orum et al., 1999), fusarium crown and root rot in tomatoes (Rekah\net al., 1999), plant pathogens in diseased plants (Chellemi et al., 1988), the downy mildew\npathogen (Peronospora parasitica) in cabbage (Stein et al., 1994) and citrus tristeza virus\n(Gottwald et al. 1996).\nThis study used a two-dimensional statistical modelling approach to produce detailed\ninformation on sampling strategies for surveillance of mycotoxins in raw food commodities.\nThe emphasis was on DON and OTA in large lots of grain.\nMethod\nThe model was developed using the R statistical programming language (R\nDevelopment Core Team, 2007) to investigate the effect that sample size and strategy have\non determining the mean concentration of DON and OTA in bulk commodities. The method\nwas divided in four sequential steps: generation of mycotoxin concentration data, spatial\ndistribution of the generated data, repeated generation of samples and assessment of the\nperformance of each sample size and strategy combination. The model was then run for a\nrange of scenarios.\nData generation\nRivas Casado et al. (2009) analysed the spatial structure of DON and OTA in a 26 t\ntruck of wheat with a total of 100 sampled points, from a data set collected by Biselli et al.\n(2005). The results showed that the distribution of DON was best described by a log-normal\ndistribution of mean 1342 \u03bcg kg-1 and standard deviation 340, and presented spatial structure.\nIn contrast, OTA was best described by an exponential distribution with mean 0.57 \u03bcg kg-1\nand standard deviation 1.13, and was randomly distributed in space. Rivas Casado et al.\n(2009) used geostatistical techniques to investigate the spatial distribution of DON in the\ntruck in more detail.\nGeostatistics analyses the spatial structure of a variable (in this case mycotoxin\nconcentration) using the variogram, a graph that relates the distance between any two points,\nknown as the lag distance, with their semivariance (Figure 1). Generally, points close\ntogether have more similar values than those farther apart, giving low semivariance, or\nconversely high autocorrelation, at short lag distances. Each variogram can be described by a\nset of parameters: the sill, the range and the nugget. The sill is the a priori variance, \uf0732, of the\nprocess and is generally assumed to be equal to the variance of the population (Barnes, 1991).\nThe range is the point at which the semivariance approaches the sill, so the autocorrelation\nbetween pairs of points becomes 0, marking the limit of spatial dependence: points farther\napart than this lag distance are spatially independent. The nugget is the semivariance at a lag\ndistance of 0, and identifies the measurement error and the variations that occur over lag\ndistances less than the shortest sampling interval (Webster and Oliver, 2000). Geostatistical\nanalysis is more effective when the variable has a normal (Gaussian) distribution. For this\npurpose, the data were log transformed (natural log) to meet the normality requirement. The\nresults showed that the spatial structure of DON could be described by a variogram with\nrange 4.35 m, sill 0.07 and nugget 0.013. The spatial structure defined by these parameters\nwas assumed to be representative of DON in bulk commodities, in the absence of other data,\nand was therefore used as a reference condition for data generation.\nTwo different procedures for data generation were used based on the findings\ndescribed by Rivas Casado et al. (2009): classical statistics for OTA and geostatistics for\ngeneration of DON concentration. The classical statistics procedure allowed the generation of\nrandom deviates of an exponential distribution with a density function:\n\uf0ee\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf03c\n\uf0b3\uf03d\n\uf02d\n0,0\n0,\n);(\nx\nxe\nxf\nx\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c (1)\nwhere x is the concentration of the mycotoxin and \uf06c (\uf06c > 0) is the rate parameter estimated\nthrough maximum likelihood (Equation 2)\nx\n1\uf03d\uf06c (2)\nwhere x is the sample mean concentration. This only required the mean concentration of the\nmycotoxin as an input parameter for the generation of data.\nThe geostatistical procedure generated simulations of normal random fields for the\ngiven variogram parameters. This was implemented using the geoR and RandomFields\npackages from the R programming language (R Development Core Team, 2007). This\nprocedure required values for the sill, the range and the mean of the DON population to be\ngenerated. It was assumed that the data represented values that had been transformed to give\na normal distribution, for example by a log transform, so the mean and sill should be those of\nthe transformed data. The results were transformed back to the original units for\ninterpretation. The procedure could not fully control the properties of the simulated\npopulation due to processes for random generation of values, so several were generated for\neach set of parameters, then the variogram for each was displayed and compared to the target\nvariogram to select the one that best represented the target spatial distribution.\nSpatial distribution\nThe sampled area was always represented by a 1 unit x 1 unit square, which could be\nscaled to the required dimensions. The data values were generated on a regular grid of 2500\npoints (50 x 50) in this area according to the chosen spatial distribution. For OTA, the\ngenerated values were randomly assigned to the grid points. For DON, the values were\ndistributed in the space according to the specified sill and range values. The grf function from\nthe RandomFields package in R was used for this purpose. This function generates\nsimulations of normal random fields and distributes them in a unit square accordingly to a\ngiven a set of variogram parameters. The generated data set was treated as the true\nrepresentation of DON or OTA concentration in a bulk commodity from which samples were\nto be taken.\nFor each set of parameters for either the geostatistical or classical method, M data sets\nwere generated, where M was usually set at 30. The variability of the realisations generated\nwas derived from these M simulations (Figure 2).\nRepeated generation of samples\nThe simulated distribution was sampled using different sample sizes and two\nsampling strategies, regular square grid and random, to derive statistics to allow them to be\ncompared. Each sample size between 4 and 100 was then selected R times per simulation,\nwhere R was fixed at 30. For random sampling, the required number of values was drawn\nfrom randomly selected points, so all sample sizes between 4 and 100 were possible, and\nrepetition used new random samples. For regular grids, the only sample sizes considered\nwere those that formed squares, that is the nine regular grids with 2\u201310 points in each\ndirection giving 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81 and 100 points. In this case, repeated samples\nfrom the same distribution were taken by changing the origin of the grid. There were thus a\ntotal of 87300 (30 x 97 x 30) and 8100 (30 x 9 x 30) automated results for the random and\nregular grid sampling strategies respectively (Figure 2).\nAssessment of the performance of sample size-strategy combinations\nTwo statistics must be considered for the quantification of sample and population\ndifferences: accuracy and precision. Accuracy is measured by the bias b, which is the\ndifference between the sample mean concentration \uf06d\u02c6 and the population mean concentration\n\uf06d. (Equation 3). If the mean of the sample is equal to the mean of the population, then \uf06d\u02c6 is\nsaid to be unbiased, otherwise it is said to be biased\n\uf06d\uf06d \uf02d\uf03d \u02c6b (3)\nPrecision is the degree of mutual agreement between all the points in the sample and\nis estimated by the standard deviation of the sample \uf073\u02c6 :\n1\n)\u02c6(\n\u02c6\n2\n1\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\nn\n\u03bcx\n\u03c3\nn\ni\ni\n(4)\nThe performance of each of the combinations of sample size and sampling strategy\nwas assessed using the Root Mean Squared Error (Equation 5). This statistic combines\naccuracy and precision. The smaller the RMSE, the better the estimation of the sample mean.\nThe RMSE has the advantage of having the same units as the variable under study (\uf06dg kg-1).\n22\u02c6 bRMSE \uf02b\uf03d \uf073 (5)\nA set of RMSEinr where i is the simulation number (1 \uf0a3 i \uf0a3 30), n is the sample size\n(4 \uf0a3 n \uf0a3 100) and r is the repetition (1 \uf0a3 r \uf0a3 30) was obtained by repeatedly calculating\nRMSE values for a specific sample size. The distribution of RMSE values is approximately\nnormal when more than 30 repetitions are calculated (Cochran, 1953) and therefore,\nconfidence intervals can be calculated. The size of the confidence interval for each sample\nsize and strategy was calculated by multiplying the standard error of the 30 RMSE values by\nthe standard normal value c for a specified probability level. To model the effect that the\nsample size had on the RMSE, a locally weighted regression smoothing (LOESS) function\n(Higgins, 2004) was fitted to the RMSE confidence interval with the sample size as the\nindependent variable.\nLevel of contamination\nThe analysis was repeated using three different means, for both DON and OTA, to\nhave a representative result for a range of concentrations. The selected concentrations were\nbelow, close and above the maximum level of DON (1250 \uf06dg kg-1) and OTA (5 \uf06dg kg-1) set\nby the European Commission (European Commission, 2006). For DON the model was run\nwith log-normal DON data sets with mean 6.43, 7.14 and 7.82, that is loge625 \uf06dg kg-1,\nloge1261 \uf06dg kg-1 and loge2490 \uf06dg kg-1, respectively. For OTA, the model was run with\nconcentrations 0.6 \uf06dg kg-1 (found in the data from Biselli et al. 2005), 5 \uf06dg kg-1 and\n10 \uf06dg kg-1. The spatial structure parameters found in the data from Biselli et al. were used as\nreference values to generate DON data for any of the three mean concentrations considered.\nThe variogram parameters used were sill 0.07, range 4 m, and nugget 0.\nA total of 30 simulations (M=30) of log-normal DON data sets with mean 7.14 and 30\nsimulations of exponential OTA data sets with mean 0.6 \uf06dg kg-1 were generated to assess the\nreliability of the methods for data generation. The results showed that there was little\nvariation between simulation, so subsequently only one was run for each set of parameters.\nResults\nFor DON, the results for the assessment of the reliability of the geostatistical method\nfor data generation showed that the approximations to the requested population mean and\nstandard deviation were close to the target values: for the 30 simulations the average of the\npopulation mean was 7.15, which was close to the 7.14 target mean. The maximum and\nminimum population mean obtained were 7.26 and 7.00, respectively. The standard deviation\n(\uf073 = 0.27) obtained was also very close to the target value (\uf073 = 0.23), this being determined\nby the sill of the spatial structure.\nThe simulated DON spatial structure showed that the nugget and the sill were close to\nthe required values. The mean sill was 0.069 with a standard deviation of 0.0068 which was\nvery close to the 0.07 target. This was consistent with the results obtained for the standard\ndeviation of the population. The mean nugget was 0.0010 with a standard deviation of 0.0037\nwhich was also very close to the 0 target nugget. The values of the range did not accurately\nadjust to the target value. The mean range obtained for the 30 repetitions was 0.165 units with\na standard deviation of 0.056, which differed considerably from the target value of 0.4 units.\nFor OTA and a target mean of 0.6 \uf06dg kg-1, the thirty simulations had a mean value of\n0.602 \uf06dg kg-1 and a standard deviation of 0.012. This showed that there was little variation\nbetween generated data sets for the same target value.\nFor both cases, the statistics derived by repeated sampling from different simulations\nwith the same parameters differed little between simulations. As noted above, it was\nconcluded that it was sufficient to generate one simulated population for each set of\nparameters.\nThe RMSE changed in proportion to the mean concentration. For example, for the\nsimulation of DON with mean concentration of 625 \uf06dg kg-1 and for different samples, the\nRMSE was 90\u2013300 \uf06dg kg-1 (14\u201348% of the mean) and for the simulation with mean\nconcentration of 2490 \uf06dg kg-1 it was 300\u20131100 \uf06dg kg-1 (12\u201344%). Similar results were seen\nfor OTA.\nThe general pattern observed for the majority of the LOESS equations fitted showed a\ndecrease in the slope of the curve at 40\u201360 samples (Figure 3), beyond which the RMSE did\nnot decrease as significantly for each increment in the sample size. The RMSE is made up of\nthe sample standard deviation and the bias. The bias should tend to 0 when increasing the\nsample size and therefore the main contribution to the RMSE for large samples is the\nstandard deviation of the sample. For sample sizes close to the population size, the RMSE\nwould be very close to the standard deviation of the population and no further gain in\naccuracy could be obtained. This point was reached at 40\u201360 samples.\nFor DON, the graphs of RMSE + 95% confidence interval (Figure 4a) showed that the\nresults of regular grid sampling were more consistent than random sampling. For a given\nsample size, the RMSE for random sampling was sometimes as low as or lower than that for\nregular grid sampling, but in most cases it was higher. This is probably the result of bias\nintroduced by clusters of relatively closely spaced, and therefore correlated, points. This\nsuggests that it is better to use regular grid sampling strategies when spatial structure is\nexpected for the mycotoxin concentration. For OTA (Figure 4b), the difference between the\nstrategies was small. The scatter-plots for the RMSE + 95% confidence interval showed\noverlapping results for the two methods. In general, for the OTA data sets the difference\nbetween the two sampling strategies was negligible.\nDiscussion\nThe assumptions made in the model and its limitations, particularly the distributions\nused, must be considered when interpreting the results and should be verified in practice.\nThe model was reliable at generating data sets with the target DON and OTA mean\nconcentration. However, in some cases the model failed to reproduce the target spatial\nstructure for DON. When the maximum range value generated was below the target range, a\nless smooth spatial distribution than intended was generated. In general this would be\nexpected to reduce the differences between random and regular sampling, and to increase the\nbias. Despite this, clear differences were found between the two sampling methods. If the\nintention in future was to simulate a particular observed distribution, this could be done by\nincreasing the target value of the range until the result from the simulated data matched the\nobservation. In this case the aim was to examine a range of possible distributions. Consistent\nresults were obtained across all mean concentrations, and contrasts were found between\nrandom and regular sampling.\nFor both strategies and both mycotoxins, the accuracy of the estimation of the mean\nconcentration increased significantly up to sample sizes of 40\u201360 (depending on the\nsimulation). The effect of sample size was small when it exceeded 60 points, which suggests\nthat the maximum sample size required is of this order. European Commission regulations\nspecify 60 incremental samples from grain lots of 10\u201320 t and 100 incremental samples from\nlots over 20 t (European Commission, 2005). The model results show that these would be\nadequate in the cases simulated. On this basis, there is no evidence to recommend either a\nreduction or an increase in the number of incremental samples. These results are also\nconsistent with the findings of Coker et al. (1995) that 50\u2013100 samples are required for\ndifferent aggregate sample masses.\nThe model was designed to simulate lots of the order of 10\u2013100 t. There is no\nevidence on the spatial structure at smaller or larger scales so the results should not be\nextended at these scales without further data collection and analysis.\nThe samples used in the simulation are idealised: each is the exact value at a single\npoint, and the mean is calculated precisely. In practice each incremental sample takes a small\nmass of grain, these are mixed and the concentration is measured in a subsample. Thus there\nare two additional sources of error: the difference between finite incremental samples and\npoint measurements, and the difference between the mean of the idealised samples and the\nconcentration measured from the aggregated sample. The effects of mixing and subsampling\nhave been investigated by Whitaker (2004, 2006), and should be considered when examining\nthe total uncertainty. The mass of an incremental sample is normally 0.1\u20131.0 kg, which\nimplies that the dimensions are of the order of 0.1 m. This is small compared to the scale at\nwhich the model is intended to operate. It is therefore reasonable to treat the incremental\nsamples as point measurements.\nThe random sampling method in the model is truly random: all points are equally\nlikely to be sampled, independent of which others have been selected. In practice, when\nsomeone samples from a bed of grain, they are unlikely to take two samples very close\ntogether, so real sampling behaviour is likely to be intermediate between random sampling\nand regular grid sampling.\nThe model was based on a single set of data for DON and OTA. Further research\nwould be needed before drawing more general conclusions.\nThe model does not consider the variation in mycotoxin concentration with depth, but\nonly in two horizontal dimensions, because no data were available. Indeed, sampling using a\nconventional sample spear aggregates over the depth from one point on the surface. The data\nused to develop the model came from this type of sampling, so it is intended to be an\nempirically based representation of normal practice. Recent works on geostatistical science\nprovide a methodology to develop 3D geostatistical models (Culshaw, 2005 and\nStavropoulou et al., 2007) and could be applied to mycotoxin concentration, if suitable data\nsets were collected.\nConclusions\nThe model focused on the effect that the sampling protocol has on determining the\nstatistical properties of mycotoxin concentration. The conclusions drawn in this study must\nbe understood as preliminary outcomes of the model. The assumptions made in the\ndevelopment of the model and its limitations must be considered when interpreting the\nconclusions.\nThis study showed that the accuracy of the estimation of the mean concentration\nincreased significantly up to sample sizes of 40\u201360, which is consistent with the number of\nincremental samples taken from bulk lots under EU regulations. This applied to both spatially\nstructured and randomly distributed data across the range of mean concentrations used.\nA regular grid proved to be more consistent and accurate in the estimation of the\nmean concentration where there was spatial structure (DON). The difference between the two\nsampling strategies was negligible for randomly distributed data (OTA). This suggests that\nregular sampling strategies should be preferred to random sampling, where possible.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was funded by the Food Standards Agency Project CO3055.

The final simulated values were mean 6.5, range 3.66, sill 0.067\nand nugget 0.0091 for DON and mean 0.577 for OTA.\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n0.\n60\n0.\n65\n0.\n70\n0.\n75\nsample size\nR\nM\nS\nE\nRegular\nRandom\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n34\n0\n35\n0\n36\n0\n37\n0\n38\n0\n39\n0\n40\n0\n41\n0\nsample size\nR\nM\nS\nE\nRegular\nRandom\n(a)\n(b)\n0.\n60\n0.\n65\n0.\n70\n0.\n75\nR\nM\nS\nE\n34\n0\n35\n0\n36\n0\n37\n0\n38\n0\n39\n0\n40\n0\n41\n0\nR\nM\nS\nE\n"}
