Using this model we\ndetermine the probability distribution for the time at which each chromosomal position is replicated. From\nthis we show, contrary to previous reports, that mean replication time curves cannot be used to directly\ndetermine origin parameters.

Most bacterial genomes\nare replicated from a single origin, but the much greater\nsize of eukaryotic genomes requires multiple origins per\nchromosome to ensure that the replication process does\nnot take too long. Genome replication has been compre-\nhensively studied in the model organism S. cerevisiae\n(brewers\u2019 yeast). Origin locations in S. cerevisiae are de-\ntermined by specific DNA sequences and are thus fixed in\nevery yeast cell [1]. The positions of origins in yeast have\nbeen comprehensively catalogued [2]. However, a given\norigin may not be active during replication, because origins\nmust be licensed before the start of S phase (the part of the\ncell cycle where DNA replication takes place). Licensing\nconsists of a series of specific protein complexes binding\nat origin locations, culminating in the loading of pairs of\nMcm2-7 molecules. If in a given cell licensing of a certain\norigin is not completed by the time S phase starts, the\norigin is unable to function [3].\nHigh-throughput methods have allowed the measure-\nment of replication times as a function of chromosomal\nposition for the whole genome [4]. These experiments\nyield average replication times over large cell populations\n(typically >107 cells) and therefore can mask the cell-to-\ncell variability present in the system [5]; to date single\ncell and single molecule studies are not able to measure\nthe kinetics of whole genome replication [5,6]. The low\nabundance of the molecules involved in triggering origin\nactivation strongly suggests that origins have stochastic\nactivation times [7]. This is often ignored in the biological\nliterature, where there is a pervasive notion of a\n\u2018\u2018replication program,\u2019\u2019 in which origins are considered\nto be programmed to fire following a precisely controlled\norder. This idea has frequently led to erroneous interpre-\ntations of replication time profiles (reviewed in [8]).\nThere has been much interest recently in mathematical\nmodeling of DNA replication. Two different modeling\napproaches have been used: simulations to capture the\nreplication dynamics at a single cell level [9\u201312], and\nprobabilistic models that characterize the dynamics of\nreplication at a population level [13,14]. Some models\nof DNA replication [14,15] are closely related to\nKolmogorov\u2019s classical model of nucleation processes\n[16]. Our model can be regarded as an inhomogeneous\nmodel of nucleation with quenched disorder, where nu-\ncleation starts at specific sites. Inhomogeneous models of\nnucleation have been studied in the context of statistical\nphysics and have relevance to surface science and other\nareas [17,18].\nReference [14] is particularly relevant for this work\nbecause it proposes that origins fire stochastically in\ntime, and goes on to show that this can lead to reproducible\nreplication dynamics population wide, without the need\nto invoke a \u2018\u2018replication program.\u2019\u2019 Although valuable in-\nsights have been gained from previous works, they ignore\nthe possibility that origins can fail to license, and we will\nshow that this has a crucial effect on the system\u2019s dynam-\nics. In addition, most of the existing models are numerical.\nIn this work, we introduce an analytical model of eukary-\notic DNA replication which fully takes into account the\nstochastic nature of both origin activation and the licensing\nprocess. Using a simple two-origin chromosome, we illus-\ntrate how replication time curves from measurements\nare influenced by the stochasticity of origin activation as\nwell as by the possibility that licensing fails, reinforcing\nresults we obtained previously by direct simulations [8].\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of\nthe Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.

We derive an analytical expression relating\nthe replication time in the regions between two origins to\nthe standard deviation\u0001t of the activation time distribution\nof the origins. This is a valuable result, since few single cell\nexperiments have been able to give direct information\nabout the stochastic properties of the replication dynamics.\nOur results allow \u0001t to be obtained from widely available\npopulation-wide measurements. We apply this result to\nmeasured replication time data, and estimate \u0001t from the\ndata, obtaining a result in agreement with current estimates\nin the literature.\nIn our model we consider a chromosome with N origins,\nwhere each origin i is defined by the following: its chro-\nmosomal position xi; the probability qi that the origin\nachieves licensing (in a given cell within a population)\nand is thus capable of activating; and the activation time\nprobability distribution pi\u00f0t\u00de, which is the probability\ndensity of origin i activating and starting bidirectional\nreplication forks at time t. Since an origin may not be\ncompetent in every cell within the population, in general\nqi < 1, and pi satisfies\nR\u00fe1\n\u00011 pi\u00f0t\u00dedt \u00bc qi. The fundamental\nquantity from which all statistical properties of this system\ncan be calculated is the probability density P\u00f0x; t\u00de, defined\nsuch that P\u00f0x; t\u00dedt is the probability that chromosomal\nposition x is replicated between times t and t\u00fe dt. If\nonly origin i were present, P would be given by P\u00f0x; t\u00de \u00bc\npi\u00f0t\u0001 jx\u0001 xij=v\u00de, where v is the fork velocity, which we\nassume to be a constant.\nIn the presence of all N origins, the calculation of P\u00f0x; t\u00de\nis complicated by the fact that position x can be replicated\nby forks originated from any of the origins. Let us assume\nthat position x is replicated between times t and t\u00fe dt by a\nfork from origin i. This requires that (i) origin i activated at\ntime t\u0001 jx\u0001 xij=v, so that the fork arrives at x at time t;\nand (ii) all other origins j \u0001 i have either not activated or\nthey have activated but their forks would arrive at x later\nthan t. The probability density for event (i) is pi\u00f0x; t\u00de \u00bc\npi\u00f0t\u0001 jx\u0001 xij=v\u00de, and the probability for event (ii) is\nQi\u00f0x; t\u00de \u00bc Qj\u0001iMj\u00f0x; t\u00de, where Mi is the probability that\na fork from origin i arrives later than t, or fails to activate:\nMi\u00f0x; t\u00de \u00bc si \u00fe\nR\u00fe1\nt pi\u00f0x; y\u00dedy, where si \u00bc 1\u0001 qi is the\nprobability of origin i not being competent. Therefore,\nthe probability density Pi\u00f0x; t\u00de that position x is replicated\nby origin i at time t is\nPi\u00f0x; t\u00de \u00bc pi\u00f0x; t\u00deQi\u00f0x; t\u00de: (1)\nFinally, the probability density that position x is replicated\nat time t, irrespective of which origin the fork started\nfrom, is\nP\u00f0x; t\u00de \u00bcX\nN\ni\u00bc1\nPi\u00f0x; t\u00de: (2)\nOne of the most important quantities for comparison\nwith experimental data is the average replication time\nT\u00f0x\u00de at position x, which is given in terms of P as\nT\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc 1\n1\u0001 s1s2 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 sN\nZ \u00fe1\n\u00011\ntP\u00f0x; t\u00dedt; (3)\nwhere 1\u0001 s1s2 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 sN \u00bc\nR\u00fe1\n\u00011 P\u00f0x; t\u00dedt is the probability\nthat at least one of the origins will activate. The average\nreplication time across whole chromosomes [T\u00f0x\u00de curves]\nhas been measured in a number of organisms. However,\ncaution is required when interpreting T\u00f0x\u00de curves. In some\nof the biological literature, T\u00f0x\u00de curves are used to directly\ninfer origin parameters [4]. For example, it is widely\naccepted that the values of T at xi are the average activation\ntimes of origins. However, Eq. (3) shows that T\u00f0x\u00de is\ndetermined collectively by all origins [8]. This suggests\nthat simple interpretations of T\u00f0x\u00de are not justifiable.\nWe want to use the general theory presented above to\nstudy replication dynamics in a simple setting. From now\non we focus on the case of a hypothetical linear chromo-\nsome with just two origins. We define the chromosomal\ncoordinates so that one of the origins has position x1 \u00bc 0;\nthe other origin has position x2 \u00bc D. We assume for sim-\nplicity that each origin can activate within a time window\n\u0001t with uniform probability; we will argue later that our\nconclusions are largely independent of the precise shape of\nthe probability distribution. We select origin activation\ntimes so that the average activation time of the first origin\nis 0. The other origin has an average activation time \u0001, and\nwe assume without loss of generality that \u0001 \u0003 0. Thus the\nactivation time distributions are\npi\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc qi\u0001t ; if t 2\n\u0001\ntavi \u0001\n\u0001t\n2\n; tavi \u00fe\n\u0001t\n2\n\u0002\n; (4)\nwhere i \u00bc 1, 2, tav1 \u00bc 0, and tav2 \u00bc \u0001. p1 and p2 are set to\nzero outside the stated intervals.\nUsing Eqs. (3) and (4), we can write analytical expres-\nsions for the probability density P\u00f0x; t\u00de and the average\nreplication time T\u00f0x\u00de. From Eq. (4) and (2), P\u00f0x; t\u00de vanishes\noutside the intervals I1 and I2 given by\nIi \u00bc\n\u0001jxi \u0001 xj\nv\n\u00fe tavi \u0001\n\u0001t\n2\n;\njxi \u0001 xj\nv\n\u00fe tavi \u00fe\n\u0001t\n2\n\u0002\n; (5)\nwhere x1 \u00bc 0 and x2 \u00bc D. In total there are five scenar-\nios (depending on the relative values of \u0001, \u0001t, D, and v)\nthat differ in the dynamics of how the chromosome is\nreplicated. From here on we will consider just the case\nwhere the condition \u0001\u00fe\u0001t < D=v is satisfied, since this\nis the case for many pairs of origins in real chromo-\nsomes. This means that the variations in the activation\ntime \u0001t are small enough that a fork from one origin can\nonly replicate the other origin if that origin is not\ncompetent.

We see that T\u00f0x\u00de has discontinuous derivatives at the\norigin locations, because the forks originate there. At the\norigins, the mean replication times are\nT\u00f0x1\u00de \u00bc T\u00f00\u00de \u00bc q2s1\u00f0D=v\u00fe \u0001\u00de=\u00f01\u0001 s1s2\u00de;\nT\u00f0x2\u00de \u00bc T\u00f0D\u00de \u00bc \u00f0q1s2D=v\u00fe q2\u0001\u00de=\u00f01\u0001 s1s2\u00de:\n(7)\nIt is commonly assumed in the replication literature that\nT\u00f0x\u00de has a minimum at an origin, and that the value of this\nminimum directly gives the average activation time for the\norigin. However, Eq. (7) shows that this is not the case and,\nin fact, T\u00f0xi\u00de \u0003 tavi : the mean replication time at an origin\nlocation is equal to or greater than the origin\u2019s average\nactivation time. Only when an origin has qi \u00bc 1 can\nT\u00f0xi\u00de \u00bc tavi , because if an origin fails to activate in a given\ncell, the DNA at the origin location will not be replicated\nuntil a fork from another origin arrives. This means that Ti\nis higher for origins that are more likely to fail, as seen\ndirectly in Fig. 1. Another important conclusion from\nEq. (7) is that even when both origins have the same\naverage activation time (\u0001 \u00bc 0), generally we have\nT\u00f0x1\u00de \u0001 T\u00f0x2\u00de. This is again due to the possibility of\norigins not activating. Therefore, the origin with the lower\nminimum of T\u00f0x\u00de does not necessarily activate earlier\nthan the other origin: minima of T\u00f0x\u00de cannot be used to\ndraw conclusions on the relative activation times of the\ncorresponding origins, as previously assumed [4,10].\nEquations (1)\u2013(6) show that in general T\u00f0x\u00de at any point\ndepends collectively on the parameters of all origins.\nHowever, if an origin is highly competent, early activating,\nand isolated from other origins, T\u00f0x\u00de at that origin\u2019s posi-\ntion will be close to the origin\u2019s average activation time.\nEquation (6) challenges the assumption that origins are\nlocated at minima of T\u00f0x\u00de. From Eq. (6) the expression for\nthe slope of T near the first origin (for x > 0):\nT0\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc q1 \u0001 q2s1\nv\u00f01\u0001 s1s2\u00de : (8)\nThis expression shows that the slope is a function of the\ncompetencies qi of both origins as well as the fork velocity\nv. For the origin at x \u00bc 0 to be a minimum of T\u00f0x\u00de, we\nmust have T0 > 0 for x > 0, from which we get the condi-\ntion q1 >\nq2\n1\u00feq2 . This shows that if an origin has low com-\npetence compared to its neighbor, it may not be a minimum\nof T\u00f0x\u00de, which can be seen in Fig. 1. This phenomenon\nhas been observed in experimental data [4]. Note that if\nq1 > 1=2, this condition is always satisfied and a minimum\nis guaranteed for this two-origin system. In addition,\nEq. (8) shows that the fork velocity is not given by the slope\nof T\u00f0x\u00de, an assumption widely used in the literature [4].\nFigure 1 shows that T\u00f0x\u00de has sharp corners at origin\nlocations. The reason for this is that in every cell the forks\nalways start at the same locations (the origins), which\ncauses a discontinuous change in the proportion of left-\npropagating compared to right-propagating replication\nforks, which in turn causes the discontinuity in the deriva-\ntive of T\u00f0x\u00de at the origins. In contrast, Fig. 1 shows that the\nlocal maximum of T\u00f0x\u00de between two origins is a smooth\ncurve. The reason is that in different cells in a population\nforks meet each other and terminate at different locations\non the DNA, because of the stochastic variations in acti-\nvation times. This reasoning suggests that the shape of the\nmaxima of T could be used to infer information about the\nwidth\u0001t of the activation time distribution. We expect that\nsharp maxima should correspond to forks meeting within a\nnarrow timewindow, and consequently a small value of\u0001t;\nconversely, a broad maximum corresponds to a high \u0001t.\nThis can be seen in Fig. 2, where T\u00f0x\u00de is plotted for various\nORI1 ORI2\nx\nT (x)\nq1 0.9\nq1 0.7\nq1 0.5\nq1 0.3\nFIG. 1 (color online).

In order to investigate this more quantita-\ntively, we use the modulus of the second derivative of T\u00f0x\u00de\nat the maxima to measure how broad the maxima is\u2014low\nvalues of jT00j correspond to broad peaks. We now use\nEq. (6) to find the relationship between jT00j and the origin\nparameters. At the maximum of T\u00f0x\u00de, we find\njT00j \u00bc\n4q1q2\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\n1\u0001 j 1q2 \u0001 1q1 j\nq\nv2\u0001t\u00f01\u0001 s1s2\u00de\n: (9)\nThus jT00j is inversely proportional to \u0001t. Notice also\nthat jT00j does not depend on \u0001, which means it is indepen-\ndent of the origins\u2019 average activation times. This expres-\nsion can be used to calculate \u0001t from an experimental\nreplication time profile T\u00f0x\u00de, if the origin competencies\nand the fork velocity are known. This is a very useful result\nbecause it allows the determination of a quantity character-\nizing stochastic properties of the system \u0001t from T\u00f0x\u00de,\nwhich is defined by a population average. This is valuable\nbecause experiments to directly measure\u0001t are technically\ndifficult, and there are few results available [5,6]. We note\nthat this does not require assuming that all cells in the\npopulation are synchronized, since in each individual cell\nin an asynchronous population, the statistics of the relative\nactivation times of origins remain unaltered [8].\nEquation (9) was obtained using a simple uniform dis-\ntribution for pi\u00f0t\u00de. However, we expect it to be a good\napproximation for any single-peaked distribution function\npi\u00f0t\u00de, since Eq. (9) only involves the second moment (the\nvariance) of the distribution, and the replication dynamics\nare mostly determined by the average activation time and\nthe width of the activation distribution\u2014the first and sec-\nond moments of pi\u00f0t\u00de. To test this assumption we used\nEqs. (1)\u2013(6) to numerically compute T\u00f0x\u00de for pairs of\norigins with either a Gaussian or a skewed distribution\nthat lead to sigmoidal cumulative distributions [14].\nChoosing parameters such that all these distributions\nhave the same mean and variance, we find that in all cases\nT00 never differs between distributions by more than 10%.\nDespite the fact that we have been considering a hypo-\nthetical two-origin chromosome, we expect Eq. (6) to be a\ngood approximation for chromosomes with many origins\nwhen two neighboring origins are relatively isolated from\nother origins. To test this, we looked at experimental data\n[4] for S. cerevisiae chromosome X, specifically the region\ncontaining origins ARS1012\/13 andARS1014 (Fig. 3). The\nsmoothness of the curve\u2014ignoring the fluctuations caused\nby experimental noise\u2014is direct evidence for stochastic\norigin activation, in agreement with other results [5,6]. We\nfitted a parabola through the data points and from this\ndetermined the value of jT00j. Using Eq. (9) we estimate\nthe value of\u0001t as 10.8 min [19]. This value is in agreement\nwith the limited number of single cell measurements that\nhave been made at other S. cerevisiae origins [6].\nWe thank M. Hawkins for valuable discussions.
