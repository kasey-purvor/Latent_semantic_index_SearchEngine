Introduction\nAn important challenge in oceanography is the accu-\nrate determination of the ocean\u2019s time-mean dynamic\ntopography (MDT). If this can be achieved with suf-\nficient accuracy for combination with the time-\ndependent component of the dynamic topography, ob-\ntainable from altimetric data, then the resulting sum\n(i.e., the absolute dynamic topography) will give an ac-\ncurate picture of surface geostrophic currents and\nocean transports.\nA geodetic estimate of the ocean\u2019s MDT can be ob-\ntained by computing the difference between the mean\nsea surface (MSS) height obtained from satellite altim-\netry and the geoid height derived from a global gravity\nmodel:\n\u0001\u0001\u0002, \u0003\u0002 \u0003 H\u0001\u0002, \u0003\u0002 \u0004 N\u0001\u0002, \u0003\u0002, \u00011\u0002\nwhere \u0005 is latitude and \u0006 is longitude, and \u0007, H, and N\nrepresent the MDT, the MSS height, and the geoid\nheight, respectively, with a reference ellipsoid provid-\ning the common datum for the MSS and the geoid.\nPreviously this space geodetic approach has been se-\nverely limited by the accuracy of global geoid models\n(Wunsch and Gaposchkin 1980; Stammer and Wunsch\n1994; Tapley et al. 1994; Losch and Schr\u00f6ter 2004). Re-\ncently, however, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Ex-\nperiment (GRACE) mission has gone some way to\novercoming this limitation by producing geoid models\nCorresponding author address: Rory Bingham, Proudman\nOceanographic Laboratory, 6 Brownlow St., Liverpool L3 5DA,\nUnited Kingdom.\nE-mail: rjbi@pol.ac.uk\n1808 J O U R N A L O F A T M O S P H E R I C A N D O C E A N I C T E C H N O L O G Y VOLUME 25\nDOI: 10.1175\/2008JTECHO568.1\n\u00a9 2008 American Meteorological Society\nJTECHO568\nthat represent an order of magnitude improvement in\naccuracy over previous satellite-based models (Tapley\net al. 2003, 2005), while the forthcoming Gravity Field\nand Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE)\nmission promises to go even further with a target accu-\nracy of l cm down to spatial scales of 100 km (LeGrand\n2001).\nThe most detailed picture of the ocean\u2019s mean sur-\nface circulation is obtained by combining the geodetic\nestimation of the MDT with finer scale in situ observa-\ntions. And, in spite of the aforementioned improve-\nments in geoid determination, this will most likely re-\nmain the case. A number of examples of this approach\nhave been presented (e.g., Rio and Hernandez 2004;\nMaximenko and Niiler 2005). Nevertheless, it remains a\nworthwhile objective to maximize the oceanographic\ninformation that can be gleaned by purely geodetic\nmeans. To do this requires careful consideration of how\nbest to combine the MSS and geoid surfaces. Such is\nour intention with this paper.\nAlthough the geodetic MDT calculation is con-\nceptually simple, complications arise for the following\nreasons. (i) The spatial variations of H and N are ap-\nproximately two orders of magnitude larger than the\nspatial variations in \u0007, O(l m). Thus, we are looking for\nthe small residual MDT from the difference of two\nlarger fields, and therefore the MDT computation is\nextremely sensitive to any error in either the geoid or\nMSS\u2014even a 1% error in either field can lead to errors\nin the MDT that are of the same order of magnitude as\nthe MDT itself. (ii) A solution for the earth\u2019s gravity\nfield is most naturally expressed, and usually supplied,\nas a spectral model, consisting of a set of spherical har-\nmonic coefficients. On the other hand, the MSS, which\nof course is defined only over the ocean, is available to\noceanographers as a gridded product. These are clearly\nincompatible, and must therefore be made consistent\nbefore the required difference can be obtained.\nGiven that the MDT is required by oceanographers\nin geographical form, the obvious and most straightfor-\nward approach is to express the geoid height geographi-\ncally so that it can then be subtracted in a pointwise\nfashion from the MSS, as in Eq. (1). We refer to this as\nthe pointwise approach. Jayne (2006) provides an ex-\nample of this approach using a GRACE geoid model.\nThe critical step in estimating the pointwise MDT is the\ncomputation of the gridded geoid height field. This is\ndefined as the height of the geoid relative to a reference\nellipsoid, which, for the purpose of calculating the\nMDT, should be that to which the MSS is referred.\nOnce the geoid height has been computed it is a simple\nmatter to subtract it from the gridded MSS to yield the\nocean\u2019s MDT. A thorough discussion of the subtleties\nof geopotential modeling is provided by Smith (1998),\nand full details of the geoid height computation as it\npertains to oceanography can be found in Hughes and\nBingham (2008).\nIn computing the MDT one has to choose a degree L\nat which to truncate the expansion of geoid, limited by\nthe maximum degree of the supplied model. Since de-\ngree L corresponds approximately to a spatial scale, or\nhalf wavelength, of 20 000 L km\u00041 the gridded geoid\nheight field will not include spatial scales less than this.\nA pointwise MDT computed using a geoid truncated at\ndegree 100 is shown in Fig. 1a. We see that while the\ngross features of the ocean\u2019s gyre circulation can be\ndiscerned, the detail is obscured by noise. The primary\nsource of this noise is geoid omission error due to the\ntruncation of the spectral geoid model.\nOmission errors in a spectral model manifest them-\nselves in two ways when projected into the spatial do-\nmain: one local, corresponding to the absence of small-\nscale physical features in the true field, and the other\nnonlocal, corresponding to Gibbs oscillations, which\ndecay slowly away from discontinuities or sharp gradi-\nFIG. 1.

(b) The com-\nponent of the OCCAM MDT removed by the application of a\nGaussian filter of 400-km half-weight radius.\nOCTOBER 2008 B I N G H A M E T A L . 1809\nFig 1 live 4\/C\nents in the field. Both these aspects of the geoid omis-\nsion error, although small in comparison to the magni-\ntude of the geoid itself, if not mitigated, lead to large\nMDT errors, the magnitude of which depend inversely\non the truncation degree L. A further source of error,\nwhich, unlike omission error, increases exponentially\nwith L, is the geoid commission error. However, as shall\nbe shown below, for L \b 100 omission error is the\ndominant source of error in the MDT.\nWith the pointwise approach local errors of omission\nin the gridded geoid leak into the MDT because the\nMSS contains small scales missing from the geoid. This\nmeans that upon differencing the MDT retains these\ngeodetic features as errors, most prominently at small\nscale but large-amplitude features of the ocean floor\ntopography, such as ridges, trenches, fracture zones,\nand seamounts (Tapley et al. 2003). It is in the vicinity\nof these features that nonlocal geoid omission error\nalso has its greatest impact on the pointwise MDT. But\nthe nonlocal nature of the Gibbs oscillations means that\neven in regions, such as the abyssal plains, where there\nare few small-scale geodetic features to resolve, geoid\nomission error leads to significant contamination of the\nMDT. Moreover, even steep gradients in the geoid over\nland can lead to large errors in the computed MDT.\nThis is apparent, for instance, in the southeast Pacific\nalong the Andean edge of South America.\nThe nonlocal nature of Gibbs oscillations, which re-\nsult in substantial topography over land leading to er-\nrors over the ocean, has previously been identified in\nthe context of spectral climate models (e.g., Hoskins\n1980; Lindberg and Broccoli 1996).\nNote that, while the application of a spectral domain\nsmoothing kernel, such as that proposed by Jekeli\n(1981), can reduce the nonlocal Gibbs omission error in\nthe gridded geoid, any improvement in the MDT is\nmore than offset by a concomitant increase in MDT\nerrors from local geoid omission error.\nThe common solution to the problem of geoid omis-\nsion error contamination of the MDT is to use a spatial\naveraging filter to smooth the MDT. Many filter ker-\nnels can be defined, each with its own spectral charac-\nteristics. Jayne (2006) for example uses a Hamming\nwindow. Yet, whichever filter is chosen, there are a\nnumber of problems with spatial smoothing. First, there\nis the issue of signal attenuation, whereby, in addition\nto removing unwanted noise, meaningful oceano-\ngraphic information is also lost. This is illustrated in Fig.\n1b where we have subtracted from an MDT generated\nby a high-resolution global ocean data assimilation ex-\nperiment (Fox and Haines 2003) using the 1\/4\u00b0 36-level\nOcean Circulation and Climate Advanced Modelling\nProjects (OCCAM) model (Webb et al. 1997) the same\nMDT smoothed with a 400-km Gaussian filter. The\nOCCAM MDT is obviously not contaminated by geoid\nerrors and therefore the undesired consequence of fil-\ntering manifests itself clearly as the parallel positive and\nnegative bands that appear in regions of strong ocean\ncurrents such as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current\n(ACC), the Gulf Stream, the Kuroshio Current and its\nextension, and the equatorial currents. The effect of\nfiltering is to \u201csmear out\u201d the MDT gradient, resulting\nin weaker and less well-defined estimates of the ocean\ncurrents. Because the degree of signal attenuation is\nproportional to the width of the filter used, it is impor-\ntant to find the minimum filter radius sufficient to re-\nmove the noise. A further issue is how to best to apply\nthe filter where it encompasses grid points where the\nMDT is undefined, such as over land. Setting such grid\npoints to zero in the filtered value causes attenuation in\ncoastal regions, whereas excluding them modifies the\nspectral characteristics of the filter.\nThe issue of signal attenuation in particular moti-\nvates the consideration of alternatives to the pointwise\napproach that may reduce the need for spatial smooth-\ning, thereby allowing us to obtain the maximum\noceanographic information from the data. Tapley et al.\n(2003) use a spectral approach whereby the MSS is first\nexpressed in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients.\nTruncating the spectral model of the MSS then ensures\nthat both the MSS and the geoid represent the same\nspatial scales. The computation of spherical harmonics\nrequires a globally defined surface, and Tapley et al.\n(2003) use a geoid based on Earth Gravity Model 1996\n(EGM96) to form a globally defined MSS\u2013geoid hybrid\nsurface. However, by distinguishing between the local\nand nonlocal effects of omission error we find that\nforming a hybrid surface using the same geoid as that\nused in the actual MDT calculation gives better results.\nIn this study we also assess the relative merits of the\npointwise and spectral approaches. As shown in detail\nbelow the benefit of the spectral method is that it mini-\nmizes the negative effects of spatial smoothing and dif-\nficulties encountered in coastal regions. Moreover, it\nallows us to distinguish more readily between the im-\npact of the geoid omission and commission errors on\nthe MDT, which in turn allows us to determine a limit\nto the spatial scales that can be resolved with the data.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows.\nIn the next section the gravity and altimetry datasets\nused in the study are described. In section 3 we present\nthe spectral MDT method and describe how the prob-\nlems associated with the MSS not being defined glob-\nally may be overcome. In section 4 we assess the spec-\ntral method against the pointwise approach and dem-\nonstrate the superiority of the former. In section 5 we\n1810 J O U R N A L O F A T M O S P H E R I C A N D O C E A N I C T E C H N O L O G Y VOLUME 25\ndraw conclusions from the work presented regarding\nthe estimation of the ocean\u2019s MDT using geodetic data.\n2. Data\na. Altimetry data\nThe most recent MSS calculated by Collecte Locali-\nsation Satellites (CLS), designated MSSCLS01 (but\nhere shortened to CLS01), provides the altimetric\ndataset used in this study. This surface corresponds to\nthe 1993\u201399 time mean period and is derived from 7 yr\nof Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX)\/Poseidon\ndata, 5 yr of European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-\n1\/2) repeat-track and geodetic data, and 2 yr of Geosat\ndata, and is defined globally between 80\u00b0S and 82\u00b0N\n(these limits being set by the orbital configuration of\nthe satellites). CLS01 is defined on a regular grid with\na high spatial resolution of 2 arc minutes, based on the\nnonrepeating geodetic sampling of the ERS and Geosat\nmissions. Along the repeated altimeter tracks the sea\nsurface height (SSH) is well sampled and the errors in\nCLS01 are small (see Fig. 2). In between these tracks\nthe sea surface height is only sampled once or twice\nduring the geodetic mission phases and thus the errors\nare larger. The largest errors, rising to 4 cm, can be\nfound in the tropics where SSH variability is high, and\nwhere the satellite ground tracks are farthest apart.\n(For further details see Hernandez and Schaeffer 2001.)\nb. Gravity model\nCurrently, the best global gravity model for oceano-\ngraphic purposes is undoubtedly provided by the\nGRACE satellite mission. The second GRACE gravity\nmodel, designated GGM02, was based on 363 days of\ndata spanning the period from April 2002 to December\n2003 (Tapley et al. 2005). Two variants are provided by\nthe Center for Space Research (CSR) in Texas, the\nfirst\u2014GGM02S\u2014uses GRACE gravity data only, and\nis supplied as a set of spherical harmonic coefficients\ncomplete to degree and order 160. This corresponds to\na spatial resolution of approximately 125 km. The sec-\nond model\u2014GGM02C\u2014is constrained by additional\nterrestrial gravity and MSS information, and is supplied\nto degree and order 200. However, due to the lack of\ntransparency in the contribution made to the geoid\nfrom these additional data sources, in this analysis we\nfocus on the satellite-only solution (except in the form-\ning a hybrid MSS\u2013geoid surface for the spectral\nmethod, where we use GGM02C).\nPresently, an error field is not supplied with the\nGRACE gravity models. However, results published by\nTapley et al. (2005, see their Fig. 4) show that for\nGGM02S expanded to degree 70 the global RMS error\nis approximately 7 mm, with a maximum of approxi-\nmately 9 mm at the equator where the ground track\nspacing of the satellites is greatest. The error field is\nalso zonally homogeneous, with no differences appar-\nent between land and sea.\nc. Grid manipulations\nWith the pointwise approach, the geoid height field is\ncomputed on a global grid of 0.5\u00b0 resolution in both\nlongitude and latitude, and bicubic spline interpolation\nis used to define the MSS on the same grid. The spectral\nmethod involves replacing appropriate values in the\nsupplied CLS01 surface with GGM02C values. To do\nthis GGM02C geoid heights are computed on a 0.5\u00b0\nglobal grid. Bicubic interpolation is then used to project\nthe geoid height field onto the CLS01 grid, and the\nappropriate values in the supplied CLS01 surface, iden-\ntified by flags in the accompanying error field, are re-\nplaced. Bicubic interpolation is then used again to re-\nturn the hybrid surface to the 0.5\u00b0 global grid from\nwhich the spectral model is computed. Ideally, we\nwould avoid interpolation by computing the geoid\nheight field on the CLS01 grid directly from the spheri-\ncal harmonic coefficients, and computing the spectral\nmodel from the high-resolution hybrid surface. How-\never, this is rather computationally demanding, and in\nany case errors introduced by the required interpola-\ntions are small.\n3. The spectral method\nTo truncate a spectral geoid model to obtain a grid-\nded geoid height field is to apply a low-pass boxcar\nfilter in the spectral domain. This filter acts to smooth\nFIG. 2.

The white areas adjacent\nto coastlines indicate where interpolation has been used to join\nthe true MSS to the geoid. Note that this results in many islands\nconsisting entirely of interpolated values.\nOCTOBER 2008 B I N G H A M E T A L . 1811\nFig 2 live 4\/C\nthe field, and is an ideal filter in the sense of having a\nperfectly defined cutoff frequency. Such a filter admits\n(stops) all frequencies below (above) the cutoff fre-\nquency, regardless of their amplitude. However, such\nideal filters are problematic in practice because they\nlead to Gibbs oscillations if the field includes disconti-\nnuities or even just steep gradients. To ensure the MSS\nincludes only those scales represented by the filtered\ngeoid height field, it too must be filtered, otherwise the\nMDT will include small-scale geodetic features that are\npresent in the MSS but not in the truncated geoid\nheight field. The Gibbs oscillations in the geoid height\nfield must also be removed to prevent them contami-\nnating the MDT. The standard approach is to filter the\nMDT (equivalent to filtering the geoid and MSS sepa-\nrately) with a spatial averaging filter to remove both of\nthese effects. However, this type of filter lacks the ideal\ncharacteristics of truncation in the spectral domain,\nmeaning some fraction of the power at frequencies\nwithin the transition zone is admitted. Therefore, in\neffectively removing the noise we also attenuate scales\nin the MDT that ideally should be retained. [See Emery\nand Thomson (2001) for a more details of the issues of\nGibbs oscillations and ideal filters.]\nSuppose the spatial equivalent of the spectral boxcar\nfilter can be obtained. Applying this filter to the MSS\nwould then ensure that both the MSS and the geoid\nheight field represented the same physical scales. Also,\nthe attenuation of the scales to be retained, which oc-\ncurs with spatial averaging filters, would be avoided.\nMoreover, since the MSS is very similar to geoid, fil-\ntering the MSS would lead to similar Gibbs oscillations\nin the vicinity of any steep gradients in the gravity field\nover the ocean as occur in the truncated geoid. Upon\nsubtracting to obtain the MDT these would negate each\nother leaving the MDT free from Gibbs oscillations due\nto significant seafloor topography. However, many of\nthe Gibbs oscillations in the gridded geoid height field\nover the ocean are due to continental topographic fea-\ntures. This problem can be resolved by creating a hy-\nbrid globally defined surface that uses geoid height as a\nproxy for the MSS over land. When filtered, this hybrid\nsurface would include all of the Gibbs oscillations that\nare present in the gridded geoid height field, resulting\nin an MDT free from Gibbs oscillations.\nWhile the above spatial filtering approach is theoret-\nically possible, in practice a much more straightforward\nand computationally efficient method is to compute a\nset of spherical harmonic coefficients for the MSS\/\ngeoid hybrid surface. This spectral model of the hybrid\nsurface can be truncated in exactly the same way as the\ngeoid is truncated, leading to similar omission errors,\nlocal and nonlocal, in both surfaces. In fact, the differ-\nence between the MSS and the geoid can be taken in\nthe spectral domain before expressing the MDT geo-\ngraphically. The remainder of this section is devoted to\ndescribing this method in detail.\na. Mathematical background\nSuppose for the moment that the ocean covered the\nearth\u2019s entire surface so that the MSS was a globally\ndefined field. Then, from Eqs. (1) and Bruns formula\n[Eq. (23) of Hughes and Bingham (2008); see also\nSmith (1998) for a discussion], and given the orthogo-\nnality of the spherical harmonic functions, it is straight-\nforward to show that the equivalent spherical harmonic\ncoefficients CHl,m and S\nH\nl,m, where l is the degree and m\nthe order, for the disturbing potential that would exist\nif the geoid was identical to the MSS(N \t \u0007), would be\ngiven by the global integral:\n\u0001Cl,mH\nSl,m\nH \u0002 \u0003 rel\t14\u0004GMal \u0003S \u0005\u0001\u0002\u0006\u0002H\u0001\u0002, \u0003\u0002\n\n \u0001 cos\u0001m\u0003\u0002sin\u0001m\u0003\u0002\u0002P\u02dcl,m\u0001cos\u0002\u0002 ds, \u00012\u0002\nwhere P\u02dcl,m are the associated Legendre polynomials, re\nis the radial distance to the surface of the reference\nellipsoid, a is the earth\u2019s semimajor radius, GM is the\nearth\u2019s gravitational mass constant, and where \u000b is the\nnormal gravity on the surface of the reference ellipsoid,\ngiven by the formula of Somigliana [see Moritz (1980),\nhis Eq. (2.16)], where \u0005\f is geodetic colatitude. The\nspectral representation of the global MDT would then\nbe given by\n\u0001C, S\u0002l,m\n\u0001 \u0003 \u0001C, S\u0002l,m\nH \u0004 \u0001C, S\u0002 l,m\nN . \u00013\u0002\nThis subtraction would be possible up to the maximum\ndegree L provided by the geoid model, and the MDT\ncould then be expressed spatially using\n\u0001\u0001\u0002, \u0003\u0002 \u0003\nGM\nre\u0005\u0001\u0002\u0006\u0002 \rl\u00032\nL \u0004 are\u0005\nl\n\r\nm\u00030\nl\nP\u02dcl,m\u0001cos\u0002\u0002\u000eCl,m\n\u0001 cos\u0001m\u0003\u0002\n\t Sl,m\n\u0001 sin\u0001m\u0003\u0002\u000f, \u00014\u0002\nagain limited by the maximum degree L of the coeffi-\ncients available.\nHowever, in reality, of course, the MSS is not a glob-\nally defined field. This leads to the problem of what\nvalue to assign undefined regions in the global integra-\ntion of Eq. (2). If one were to use Eq. (2) to calculate a\nset of spherical harmonic coefficients for the MSS using\n0 (or some other constant) for undefined regions, then\nits expansion back into geographical space would be\n1812 J O U R N A L O F A T M O S P H E R I C A N D O C E A N I C T E C H N O L O G Y VOLUME 25\nseverely contaminated by Gibbs oscillations due solely\nto the discontinuities between defined and undefined\nregions. These Gibbs oscillations would then contami-\nnate the MDT, especially near coastlines where the am-\nplitude of the Gibbs oscillations would be at their great-\nest (see Fig. 3a). Since many important currents occur\nin precisely these boundary regions this is highly unde-\nsirable. We now consider how best to deal with this\nproblem.\nb. Producing a globally defined surface\nSince the MSS is to a close approximation equal to\nthe geoid, the problems caused by undefined regions\ncan be greatly reduced by using a geoid as a proxy to\nproduce a globally complete MSS\/geoid hybrid surface.\nHere we use GGM02C expanded to degree and order\n200 as the proxy in order to get as close as possible to\nthe observed gravity field. (However, this makes little\ndifference compared with using GGM02S expanded to\ndegree and order 160, with some smoothing to suppress\nthe commission error.) The improvement that using a\nproxy yields is illustrated by Fig. 3b, which shows the\nMDT produced using the hybrid surface. Now all the\nsignificant features of the ocean\u2019s gyre circulation are\nclearly resolved. Yet the MDT still retains significant\nGibbs oscillations. It is clear from Fig. 3b that these\noscillations radiate from the Caspian Sea, and Fig. 3c\nreveals that, overlooked, they represent significant\nglobal contamination of the resulting MDT; a good ex-\nample of the nonlocal impact of the Gibbs oscillations.\nInspection reveals that they arise because the Caspian\nMSS, at least as it is defined by the CLS01 product, lies\nseveral tens of meters below the geoid. The solution is\nto replace the Caspian MSS in the hybrid surface with\nthe geoid. We found that the Caspian Sea is the only\ninland sea that gives rise to significant Gibbs oscilla-\ntions.\nIn fact, the CLS01 MSS is supplied as a continuous\nhybrid surface that is defined globally between latitudes\n80\u00b0S and 82\u00b0N using the geoid model EGM96 as a\nproxy where the MSS is undefined (shown in dark blue\nin Fig. 2). In coastal regions interpolation has been used\nto smoothly join the MSS to the geoid, and these re-\ngions are shown with white borders around the land-\nmasses in Fig. 2. However, the best possible matching of\nGibbs oscillations in the MSS\/geoid hybrid surface and\nthe geoid used to compute the MDT, and therefore the\nsmallest Gibbs residual in the MDT, is obtained when\nthe difference between the geoid used in the hybrid\nsurface and the geoid subtracted to calculate the MDT\nis small. As Fig. 4a shows, over land and in other un-\ndefined regions there are large differences between the\nEGM96 geoid heights used in CLS01 surface and geoid\nheights from GGM02S. These differences results in\nGibbs oscillations in the regridded supplied CLS01 sur-\nface over the ocean, which are substantially different to\nthe Gibbs oscillations in the gridded GGM02S geoid\nheight field. This results in residual Gibbs oscillations in\nthe MDT (see Fig. 4b). This problem is particularly\nacute in the Southern Ocean, southeastern Pacific, and\nFIG. 3. (a) An MDT computed by the spectral method with grid\npoints not corresponding to true MSS values set to 0. (b) As in (a),\nbut with grid points not corresponding to true MSS values set\nequal to the geoid model GGM02C. (c) The difference between\nthe MDT shown in (b) and a similar MDT but with the Caspian\nSea in the MSS also replaced by GGM02C. All fields are ex-\npanded to degree and order 100.\nOCTOBER 2008 B I N G H A M E T A L . 1813\nFig 3 live 4\/C\nthe South Atlantic, in the vicinity of the greatest differ-\nences in the GGM02S and EGM96 geoids.\nThe supplied CLS01 MSS smoothly joins, by inter-\npolation, the true MSS to the EGM96 geoid. This con-\ntrasts with our hybrid surface, which includes a discon-\ntinuity, equal in magnitude to the MDT, where the MSS\nmeets the geoid. This discontinuity will also lead to\nGibbs oscillations in the computed MDT. Therefore,\nwe considered keeping the interpolation region by only\nreplacing actual EGM96 values with GGM02C values\nin an attempt to reduce this discontinuity. However, the\ndifference between the Gibbs oscillations due to gradi-\nents in the interpolated zones\u2014a combination of the\neffect of interpolation and the actual differences be-\ntween EGM96 and GGM02C in these regions\u2014leads to\nsignificant Gibbs oscillations remaining in the com-\nputed MDT (see Fig. 4c). The magnitude of these are\ngreater than those that result from the discontinuity\nbetween the MSS and GGM02C. Therefore, both\nEGM96 and interpolated regions in the supplied CLS01\nMSS are replaced with GGM02C.\nIncidentally, the difference between the original\nCLS01 surface expressed as a set of spherical harmonic\ncoefficients and then regridded and the same field but\nwith the Caspian Sea region replaced with GGM02C is\nnearly identical to the difference shown in Fig. 3c. Be-\ncause, for the original surface, the true MSS is smoothly\njoined to EGM96, resulting in a steep, but finite, sided\ndepression in the Caspian Sea region, this confirms that\nit is not only true discontinuities, but also steep gradi-\nents, that give rise to Gibbs oscillations. (See also\nHughes and Bingham 2008.)\n4. Comparison of methods\nWe start by comparing unfiltered pointwise MDTs\nwith spectral MDTs along a zonal section crossing the\nAtlantic at 30\u00b0N (Fig. 5). The objective of this compari-\nson is not to establish the superiority of the spectral\napproach. This will require a comparison of filtered\nMDTs. Rather, it serves to illustrate how geoid errors\nin the MDT depend on the truncation degree, the prob-\nlems eliminated by the spectral method, and the rela-\ntive contributions made by the geoid commission and\nomission errors to the MDT error budget. This, in turn,\ninforms our choice of truncation degree and smoothing\nfilter radius (since, as we shall see, as well as filtering\nthe pointwise MDT, it is still necessary to spatially filter\nthe spectral MDT). To guide our expectations of the\nmagnitude and spatial scales to be seen in the profile,\neach geodetic MDT profile is superimposed on the\nMDT profile derived from the OCCAM ocean assimi-\nlation experiment. The main features of the subtropical\nNorth Atlantic circulation can be seen in the OCCAM\nMDT section. The strong positive gradient in the west\ncorresponds to the Gulf Stream, while the more gentle\nnegative gradient toward the east corresponds to the\nweaker interior equatorward flow.\nFigure 5 shows that the contamination of the point-\nwise MDT due to geoid omission error is greater than\nmagnitude the MDT itself for all values of L. Clearly it\nFIG. 4. (a) The difference between EGM96 and GGM02S over\nundefined MSS regions.

All fields are ex-\npanded to degree and order 100.\n1814 J O U R N A L O F A T M O S P H E R I C A N D O C E A N I C T E C H N O L O G Y VOLUME 25\nFig 4 live 4\/C\nwould be futile to attempt to obtain surface currents by\ncomputing slopes from these profiles. In contrast, for\nL \u0003 80 the spectral MDT captures the main gyre fea-\ntures and their magnitudes. The position and slope of\nthe MDT associated with the mean Gulf Stream is now\nclearly resolved, as is the gentler slope of the interior\nsouthward return flow. The gradient of the Gulf Stream\nis somewhat less than in OCCAM. This is a manifesta-\ntion of MDT, as opposed to geoid, omission error, and\nis reduced, just as the geoid omission error is, by in-\ncreasing L. Even with the spectral method, for L \u0003 80\nthere are undulations in the downward slope that ap-\npear unphysical. These are due to the geoid commission\nerror, a component of the MDT error budget that, in\ncontrast to the omission error component, grows with\nincreasing L. The result is that as L is increased beyond\ndegree 80 the spectral MDT rapidly decreases in qual-\nity.\nAn assessment of the relative impact of the geoid\nomission and commission errors on the MDT calcula-\ntion can be made by computing the global RMS differ-\nence between the pointwise and the OCCAM MDTs\nfor all possible values of L (solid line in Fig. 6a). This,\nof course, does not quantify the error exactly, only the\ndeparture from the OCCAM MDT. However, the close\ncorrespondence with CLS01 omission error curve (bro-\nken line), which is the RMS difference between the full\nMSS and the spectral model of the surface truncated at\ndegree L and that serves as a proxy for the geoid omis-\nsion error, shows that for values of L up to 130 the\ngeoid omission error has the greatest impact on the\nMDT. Beyond this, the improvement in the quality of\nFIG. 5. Zonal sections across the Atlantic at 30\u00b0N from unfiltered pointwise (left) MDTs and\n(right) spectral MDTs, with the truncation degree L increasing from top to bottom. For\nreference, an MDT section from an assimilation experiment using the OCCAM ocean model\nis also shown (broken line).\nOCTOBER 2008 B I N G H A M E T A L . 1815\nthe MDT from the reduction of the geoid omission er-\nror is outweighed by the exponentially growing geoid\ncommission error. A comparison of the pointwise and\nspectral MDTs for L \u0003 140 (Figs. 5d,h), where both\nMDTs have similar errors, confirms this.\nInterpretation of the RMS difference between the\nspectral and OCCAM MDTs (solid line in Fig. 6b) is\nnot as straightforward as it was for the pointwise case,\nwhere either the geoid omission or commission errors\ndominated. Up to degree 10, the residual is clearly\ndominated by the MDT omission error, a fact con-\nfirmed by the close correspondence with OCCAM\nMDT omission error curve (broken line), which is the\nRMS difference between the full OCCAM MDT and\nthe spectral model of the MDT truncated at degree L.\nBeyond this point, increasing L does not increase the\ncorrespondence between OCCAM and the spectral\nMDT. This is in part because of large-scale, and dy-\nnamically related, differences between the two fields,\ndue in large part to different time periods to which the\ntwo MDTs refer (1993\u201396 for OCCAM compared with\n1993\u201399 for the geodetic MDT). Because the MDT\nomission error is smaller (one\u2013two orders of magni-\ntude) than the geoid omission error, for the spectral\nMDT the impact of the geoid commission error be-\ncomes significant for much smaller values of L. In Fig.\n6b the growing impact of the geoid commission error is\nreflected in the divergence of the two curves beyond\nL \u0003 80.\nWith the spectral method some problems remain due\nto the fact that the MDT is discontinuous at land\u2013sea\nboundaries, which leads to some Gibbs oscillations in\nthe gridded MDT, although these are much smaller\nthan with the pointwise method. Also, depending on\nour choice of L, there will be some noise from the geoid\ncommission error. Hence, the spectral method results in\nan MDT that still requires some additional spatial\nsmoothing. In the remainder of this section, therefore,\nwe will compare filtered versions of both MDTs to de-\ntermine if indeed the spectral method yields any advan-\ntage over the pointwise method.\na. Filtering method\nA wide range of spatial averaging filters are avail-\nable, each with its own spectral characteristics. The re-\nsults presented here are for a Gaussian filter defined in\nthe spatial domain by\nf\u0001r\u0002 \u0003 exp\u0001\u0004r2\u00072\b2\u0002 \u0007\u0001\u00102\u0004\b\u0002, \u00015\u0002\nand truncated at r \u0003 10\u0011. However, the results obtained\nwere not significantly different from those obtained us-\ning other spatial averaging filters in common use (in-\ncluding Hamming and Hanning filters, and a Gaussian\nfilter truncated at r \u0003 2\u0011). Unlike, a so-called ideal\nfilter, the cutoff frequency of a practical filter can only\nbe defined approximately. The spectral characteristics\nof the Gaussian filter are defined by its half-weight ra-\ndius \u0012, where f(\u0012) \u0003 f(0)\/2, which gives \u0011 \u0003\u0010\u00122\/(2 ln 2).\nFIG. 6.

In the\nspatial domain this problem is readily alleviated by ex-\ncluding undefined land values from the filter. Excluding\nland values does, however, reduce the averaging area,\nresulting in undesirable modification of the spectral\ncharacteristics of the filter. If the filter radius has been\ncarefully chosen to be no more than is necessary to\nremove noise over the open ocean, then the latter op-\ntion may result in ineffective noise suppression in\ncoastal regions. As we shall see, this is a particular\nproblem for the pointwise approach, for which the larg-\nest errors tend to occur adjacent to coastlines. Inciden-\ntally, the inability to distinguish values over land is one\nreason why, although possible, we do not filter the\nMDT in the spectral domain using a spectral filter\nequivalent to spatial averaging, such as that proposed\nby Jekeli (1981).\nAs discussed in the introduction, to avoid degrading\nthe oceanographic signal it is important to find the\nminimum filter radius that is sufficient to remove noise.\nThe filter radius r \u0003 r0 is judged to be sufficient when\nthe difference between an MDT smoothed with a filter\nof radius r0 and with a filter of radius r \u0003 r0 \t 50 km\ndoes not include any patterns characteristic of either\nthe Gibbs oscillations (dominated by decaying oscilla-\ntions at the boundaries of the MDT) or the commission\nerror (dominated by meridional stripiness). By using\nthe dominant contamination patterns as the criteria by\nwhich to find the sufficient filter radius, other noise\nwith spatial scales equal to, or smaller than, the domi-\nnant noise components is also effectively suppressed.\nb. Comparison of filtered MDTs\nAs we have seen, geoid commission errors become a\nsignificant error source in the spectral MDT beyond a\nmaximum truncation degree of L \u0003 80. So here we\nbegin by comparing the spectral and pointwise methods\nfor the L \u0003 80 case. Using \u0012 \u0003 20000\/80 \u0003 250 km as\na starting point, we found that a half-weight radius of\n200 km was sufficient to effectively suppress the re-\nmaining noise in the spectral MDT (see Fig. 7a). The\ntechnique of finding the sufficient filter radius is dem-\nonstrated by Fig. 8a. Decreasing the filter radius to 150\nkm permits noise of a few centimeters in amplitude,\nwhile increasing the radius to 250 km results in little\nchange to the MDT profile, apart from diminishing the\nGulf Stream gradient. This convergence at 200 km in-\nFIG. 7. (a) The spectral MDT expanded to degree 80 and smoothed with a Gaussian filter of 200-km\nhalf-weight radius.

(d) The difference between the spectral MDT shown in (a) and the same\nMDT, but smoothed with a Gaussian filter of half-weight radius of 300 km.\nOCTOBER 2008 B I N G H A M E T A L . 1817\nFig 7 live 4\/C\ndicates that we have removed the noise, and further\nfiltering only serves to attenuate the ocean signal. Con-\nvergence occurs because the dominant noise has a char-\nacteristic length scale and amplitude.\nApplying a filter of 200-km radius to the L \u0003 80\npointwise MDT on the other hand, leaves significant\ncontamination remaining (see Fig. 7b and also the blue\ncurve in Fig. 8b). From inspection of the MDT and the\ndifference between the MDTs produced by the two ap-\nproaches (see Fig. 7c) one can clearly see that the re-\nsidual contamination in the filtered pointwise MDT is\ndue primarily to the nonlocal Gibbs component of the\ngeoid omission error. To remove this noise from the\npointwise MDT, applying similar criteria as we did for\nthe spectral MDT, we find 300 km to be a sufficient\nfilter radius (see Fig. 8b). The fact that the pointwise\nMDT requires filtering at 300 km rather than at 200 km,\nas is required for the spectral MDT, results in an addi-\ntional attenuation of the gradients corresponding to\nocean currents and loss of fine detail. This is demon-\nstrated in Fig. 7d where the L \u0003 80 spectral MDT fil-\ntered at 300 km has been subtracted from the same\nMDT filtered at 200 km. The greater filter radius results\nin a significant additional attenuation of the gradients\ncorresponding to strong currents such as the ACC, the\nGulf Stream, and the Kuroshio and its extension. We\nalso see the reduction of currents around the bound-\naries of the subpolar gyres in both the North Pacific and\nthe North Atlantic, and a further flattening of ridges in\nthe MDT corresponding to the equatorial currents. In\nplaces, the attenuation corresponds to a reduction in\nthe MDT gradient of greater than 10 cm over a distance\nof a few hundred kilometers. At midlatitudes this cor-\nresponds to an underestimate of geostrophic current\nspeeds of up to 10 cm s\u00041.\nThe above analysis shows that the growth of geoid\ncommission errors places a limit on the oceanographic\nscales that can be recovered from the data. Beyond a\ntruncation of L \u0003 80, the geoid commission errors start\nto make a significant impact on the spectral MDT, and\nthat a filter radius of 200 km is required to suppress this\nnoise. (Although the same errors are present in the\npointwise MDT at L \u0003 80, they are insignificant be-\ncause it is dominated by geoid omission errors.) Now, if\nwe increase the truncation point beyond L \u0003 80, we\ndecrease the dominant spatial scale of the noise. How-\never, as the summation of Eq. (4) implies, the noise that\nwas present at L \u0003 80 must remain. Therefore, we still\nneed a filter of at least 200 km to produce an MDT free\nfrom noise (see Fig. 9). For the pointwise method, how-\never, the situation is different because at L \u0003 80 the\npointwise MDT is mainly contaminated by the geoid\nomission error. This error is reduced by increasing L,\nand at some value (in the present case L \u0013 140) the\ngeoid commission errors begin to dominate. This will\nbe the same as the geoid commission error affecting the\nspectral MDT. Therefore, for the reasons that apply to\nthe spectral case, we will need a filter radius of at least\n200 km to remove the geoid commission error. In short,\nthe best we can do, without a more effective method of\nremoving the geoid commission error, is the MDT\nshown in Fig. 7.\nFigure 10 shows that by taking L \u0003 140 and using a\nfilter radius of 200 km the difference between the point-\nwise and spectral approaches becomes insignificant\nover the open ocean.

Problems occur whether values over land are\nexcluded from (top panel) or included in (bottom\npanel) the averaged values. Interpreted oceanographi-\ncally, these differences, which are greater than 5 cm at\nmost coasts, would imply significant coastal currents.\nWhen land values are excluded the spectral character-\nistics of the filter change, such that a filter radius that\nhas been optimized to remove noise over the ocean, is\nno longer effective. This problem is exacerbated by the\nfact that, for various reasons, the effect of geoid omis-\nsion error with the pointwise approach is generally\ngreatest at the coast.\nHawaii, which corresponds to a peak in the geoid,\nprovides a clear example of the problem of how exclud-\ning values over land can result in problems with the\nfiltered pointwise MDT. Truncation leads to an under-\nestimation of the gradient of the peak and subsequent\noscillations that decay away from the island. The effect\nof this geoid omission error on the MDT, even for L \u0003\n140, is revealed by subtracting from the unfiltered\npointwise MDT the spectral MDT, with L \u0003 140 in\nboth cases (see Fig. 11a). Around the island the geoid\nomission error means that the pointwise MDT is un-\nderestimated, this is followed by further oscillations of\nover- and underestimates. With the pointwise approach\nthis additional noise must be removed through spatial\nfiltering. However, the shape of the filter is such that\nthe trough around the island, already greater in magni-\ntude than subsequent oscillations, is amplified still fur-\nther relative to the subsequent oscillations (see Fig.\n11b). This means that the weighted average, which\ngives the smoothed MDT value, is dominated by the\nunderestimate in the trough. Consequently, while the\nspectral MDT meets the island (or rather the land mask\ncorresponding to the island) without deviation (black\nline in Fig. l1d), the filtered pointwise MDT is greatly\nunderestimated (by over 80 cm) where it meets the\nisland (red line). Interpreted oceanographically, this\nimplies a strong circulation around the island that, in\nreality, does not exist. The nature of the omission error\nhere is such that the complement to the omission error\ntrough around the island is a peak over the island,\nwhich if included in the weighted average compensates\nthe trough [see Figs. 11c,d (blue curve)]. This greatly\nreduces the underestimation of the MDT around the\nisland [Fig. 11d (green curve)].\nWhile including land values can reduce problems\naround small islands such as Hawaii, generally, as Fig.\n10 shows, including land values also results in problems.\nThis is because the land values in the pointwise MDT\nare nothing more than the difference between the\nEGM96 geoid used as a proxy in CLS01 and the\nFIG. 10.

This noise, together with the noise in\nthe MDT, tends to average to zero in the filter window,\nresulting in similar coastal attenuation of the MDT as\nwould occur if zero values were used over land.

Summary and conclusions\nTwo algorithms for combining MSS and satellite-\nderived geoid data to determine the ocean\u2019s mean dy-\nnamic topography (MDT) have been considered in this\npaper: a pointwise approach, whereby the gridded\ngeoid height field is subtracted from the gridded MSS\nand the resulting MDT is then spatially smoothed to\nremove noise; and a spectral approach, whereby the\nspherical harmonic coefficients of the geoid are sub-\ntracted from an equivalent set of coefficients represent-\ning the MSS, from which the gridded MDT is then ob-\ntained and spatially smoothed to remove residual noise.\nThe essential difference is that with the latter approach\nthe MSS, or rather a hybrid MSS\/geoid surface is trun-\ncated, a form of filtering, just as with the geoid.

This eliminates the need to spatial\nfilter the noise resulting from geoid omission error.\nIt is shown that geoid errors of omission can be both\nlocal and nonlocal in nature. Local omission errors re-\nfer to the absence of small-scale physical features, while\nnonlocal errors of omission are a Gibbs-type effect due\nto steep gradients in the gravity field where there is\ntopography of substantial relief. Distinguishing these\ntwo aspects of the omission error is important because\nnonlocal effects mean that even steep gradients in the\ngravity field over land can lead to contamination of the\nMDT. This means that care is required to use the best\nproxy over land in the MSS\/geoid hybrid. We find that\nthe best results are achieved by using a geoid proxy that\nis close to that used in the MDT calculation.\nIn addition to geoid errors of omission, noise in the\nMDT also arises from geoid errors of commission.\nGeoid errors of omission decrease with increasing L,\nthe truncation degree, while beyond a certain value of\nL geoid errors of commission, and the noise in the\nMDT arising from them, grows exponentially. With the\npointwise approach, noise in the MDT from omission\nerrors can be reduced by increasing L. However, this\ncomes at the expense of increased noise from the geoid\ncommission errors. By eliminating the problem of geoid\nomission error, the spectral method allows the choice of\nL to be determined solely by the growth of geoid com-\nmission errors. The spectral model of the MDT can be\ntruncated at the point at which geoid commission errors\nstart to become significant. For the GGM02S gravity\nmodel used here this is approximately at L \u0003 80.\nSpatial filtering is problematic because in addition to\nremoving noise it also attenuates the steep gradients in\nthe MDT that correspond to the ocean currents we are\nprimarily interested in. Because the degree of attenua-\ntion is proportional to the filter width, we wish to use\nthe minimum filter radius that is sufficient to remove\nnoise from the MDT. With the spectral method we do\nnot need to contend with omission error. Rather, we\nonly have to deal with the realized geoid commission\nerror, the magnitude of which we can control with our\nchoice of L, and any residual noise, which comes, pri-\nmarily, from the incomplete cancellation of the Gibbs\noscillation that occur because the MSS\/geoid hybrid is\nnot identical to the geoid. With the data used in this\nstudy we found that for the spectral MDT with L \u0003 80\nthe minimum sufficient half-weight radius of a Gauss-\nian filter was 200 km. This compares with a filter radius\nof 300 km for the pointwise method when the geoid is\ntruncated at L \u0003 80. This more severe filtering results\nin additional attenuation of MDT gradients that for the\nstrongest currents at midlatitudes is equivalent to as\nmuch as l0 cm s\u00041.\nFor the spectral MDT, increasing L beyond degree\n80, only adds errors with shorter spatial scales to the\ncommission errors already present, so we still need a\nfilter of radius at least 200 km to obtain a smooth MDT.\nWe found that by using L \u0003 140 we can reduce the\ngeoid omission error noise in the pointwise MDT to the\nstage where commission errors are dominant and then\na 200-km filter is sufficient to remove the remaining\nnoise over the open ocean. However, near coastlines,\nwhere noise due to the geoid omission errors is at its\nworst, spatial filtering is unable to remove the noise\nproperly and the spectral method produces much better\nresults. In previous studies filter radii of 330 (Jayne\n2006) and 500 km (Tapley et al. 2003) have been used,\nwith the attenuation of currents this entails. So we see\nthat a particular benefit of the spectral approach, with\na careful attempt made to find the minimum filter ra-\ndius, is that it allows us to determine, and thereby ob-\ntain, the highest possible resolution that can be ob-\ntained from the data.\nAnother possible approach that the spectral method\nallows depends on the fact that errors of omission in\neither the geoid or the MSS that propagate into the\nMDT are not the same as errors of omission in the\nspectral MDT. Unlike the geoid errors of omission,\nwhich just result in noise in the MDT that requires\nremoving, the MDT omission errors have dynamical\nsignificance. For instance, we can ask what is the limit\nbeyond which including more terms in the expansion of\nthe spectral MDT results in an insignificant increase in\noceanographic information. This depends both on geo-\ngraphical location and on the mean period over which\nthe MDT is computed. Consideration of the spectral\nMDT profiles (see Fig. 5) makes clear that in extending\nthe truncation point there is a trade-off between in-\ncreased resolution of the sharp MDT gradients corre-\nsponding to strong currents and increased contamina-\ntion due to the geoid commission errors in regions of\nbroader flows where there are larger-scale but smaller-\namplitude gradients. This is related to the signal to\nnoise ratio of the coefficients of the geoid model; only\nin regions where there are actual high-amplitude, short-\nwavelength features present in the MDT does the signal\ndominate over noise introduced by including the high-\norder terms in the expansion of the geoid, while in\nother regions the errors in the higher-order terms may\nmore than offset improvements gained by their inclu-\nsion. With the spectral method we can see therefore\nthat there may be a case for using a regionally variable\nOCTOBER 2008 B I N G H A M E T A L . 1821\nL based on an a priori estimate of the steepness of the\nMDT gradients. These issues are the focus of ongoing\nresearch by the authors.\nA further important benefit of the spectral approach\nis that it eliminates MDT errors due to the geoid omis-\nsion errors, thereby allowing us to isolate and deal with\ncommission errors separately. In this paper we have\ndealt with these by limiting the degree and order to\nwhich we truncated the expansion of the spectral model\nof the MDT and by spatial smoothing the gridded\nMDT. To filter the MDT in a more rigorous fashion\nwould require a strategy based on commission error\ncovariances for both the geoid and the MSS. Presently,\nsuch information is not available for either the MSS or\nthe GRACE gravity model. However, it is planned that\nerror covariances will be made available as part of the\ndata release from the upcoming GOCE mission, and\nhow these can best be used to constrain the MDT so-\nlution is the subject of ongoing research. (It is worth\nnoting that with the spectral method, unlike the point-\nwise method, we do not need error covariance infor-\nmation for the geoid omission error.) Ultimately, error\ncovariance information should also allow us to provide\na formal error estimate for the MDT, which at present\nwe cannot. Such an estimate is of course important if\nthe MDT is to be optimally combined with other data\nsources, or assimilated into an ocean model.\nAcknowledgments.
