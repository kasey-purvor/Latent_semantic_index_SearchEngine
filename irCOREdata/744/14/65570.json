Two have showcased agriculture and rural \ndevelopment, but this is the first to place urban areas centre stage. Unlike the rural reports, \nwhich had copious references to concrete rural development problems and policies, this \nyear\u2019s WDR is a celebration of the theoretical concept of agglomeration, and its influence in \ncreating population aggregations in urban settlements. The Report introduces and \npopularizes what is now known as the \u2018new economic geography\u2019 (NEG). This is a relatively \nrecently established branch of economics which has gained salience with the award of this \nyear\u2019s Nobel prize to one of its leading theorists, Paul Krugman. NEG draws heavily on \ngeography concepts but without geographers\u2019 qualifications, reservations and provisos. \nMuch of the declining sway of quantitative geography models in the 1980s and 1990s came \nfrom the realization that central place theory offered a fairly narrow window on the \ncomplicated dynamics of urban demographic and economic change. While drawing on \ngeography concepts, this is a report written by economists, which ignores previous \nquantitative economic geographers\u2019 work on urban agglomeration. Agglomeration is viewed \nas an imperative for development and, most significantly, an \u2018engine of growth\u2019, inverting \npast World Bank and western aid agency thinking which saw \u2018urban bias\u2019 as a severe drain \non development. Why the change of mind?  \nFirst, it is estimated that the majority of the world\u2019s population are now urban. Thus, the \nWorld Bank is giving urbanization long overdue attention. Second, NEG economists argue \nthat the concept of agglomeration provides a major analytical leap forward in economics \nresolving contradictions in classic competitive labour market models, which assumed \nconstant returns to scale. NEG economists\u2019 awareness of scalar economies yielding higher \nreturns from concentrated supplies of labour and capital have now, according to the WDR: \n\u2018diminished the disconnect between research and the real world\u2019 (p.126) and the often false \ndichotomy between internal and external economies (p.136). Claims that the NEG bridges \nthe theoretical world of economists and real world of policy makers could be construed as an \noblique way of saying that economic models hitherto were over-simplistic. But proof of the \nagglomeration concept\u2019s revolutionary insights is weakened by the use of restricted case \n16 February 2010 \nevidence primarily from industrialized countries especially the United States where patterns \nare likely to be swayed just as much by corporate organizational structure as by urban \nlocation criteria per se.  \nIt is jarring to see the World Bank pendulum of thought swing so radically from its earlier \nnegative urban bias position. Agglomeration is posited as an inherent good, optimizing \nproductivity, development and eventually welfare. Population migration and concentration \nare deemed markers of progress along the developmental path, assuming the hidden hand \nof the market propels urban agglomeration and should be given full expression without \nimpediment: \u2018So city administrators are well advised to learn what their city does, and to help \nit do this better, rather than try to change the course of their city\u2019s destiny. Planners and \npolicymakers should see their role as prudent managers of a portfolio of places, to get the \nmost from agglomeration economies\u2019 (WDR09, 128). Their role is to \u2018relax the constraints \ngenerated by the congestion and overcrowding of land and resources so that the benefits of \nagglomeration can be maximized\u2019 (WDR09, 144). \nA \u20183-D approach\u2019 referring to the main themes density (population agglomeration, urban \nareas), distance (migration, transport) and division (specialization, borders, social conflict) \nare didactically explained before schematically linking them to policy trajectories. Stress is \nplaced on the tendency for scale economies to amplify with density and attenuate with \ndistance. Analytical parts of the report read like an undergraduate textbook in NEG.  \nFor those not sharing in the euphoria of a disciplinary breakthrough in economics, there is, \nhowever, a significant departure from previous World Development reports\u2019 tendency to \nadvance simple dictums and blanket policies recommendations. In their place, multiple \npolicy options are offered, mechanistically derived but nonetheless affording some choice of \naction related to a country\u2019s degree of densification and extent of economic and social \ndivisions, stage of the urban agglomeration process. In areas of incipient urbanization the \nrecommendation is one-dimensional: \u2018build density with spatially blind institutions\u2019. In other \nwords, implement the millennium development goals and make no allowance for additional \ninfrastructural or service investment in incipient settlements. Small and secondary towns \nrepresenting intermediate urbanization are seen as sufficiently developed to warrant a two-\ndimensional policy approach involving investment in connective infrastructure such as roads, \nrail, and communications. It is only in settlements of advanced urbanization that three-\ndimensional investment involving spatially targeted investment is contemplated to \u2018address \neconomic and social divisions\u2019 due to slums and other problematic circumstances. \nThis amounts to a neat package of seemingly pragmatic policies to contend with the \u2018reality \nof growth and development\u2019 albeit grossly over-simplified, advocating \u2018spatially blind\u2019 policies \n16 February 2010 \nin most developing countries where urbanization levels are relatively low. The schema \npresupposes a market-driven growth trajectory through which lagging regions, permeated \nwith poverty and inequality, are bound to appear. Migration rather than targeted efforts to \neven out development are prescribed as the remedy. \u2018Geographic targeting\u2019 is considered to \nbe a wasteful impediment to progress.  \nApart from the blind belief in laissez-faire markets applied to countries regardless of their \nspatial planning priorities, this Report is, in effect, advocating large-scale urban migration to \npurportedly dynamic urban centres without due consideration of the environmental and \nsocial consequences that follow. Next year\u2019s WDR will deal with environmental issues in \ngeneral but there is no excuse for skating over the likely social distress and political \ninstability arising from accelerating urban growth in the absence of policies directed at \nproviding checks and balances. The Report testifies to the World Bank\u2019s continuing inability \nto integrate their economic growth-optimizing goals with the socio-political reality of widening \neconomic differentiation embedded in single-minded going-for-growth strategies. Urban \nplanners\u2019 and policymakers\u2019 concern about rapid urban growth is seen as \u2018a misplaced \npreoccupation with size, not function\u2019 (WDR09, 142). The multi-dimensional nature of urban \nareas as human settlements is lost on the NEG zealots. \u2018\u2026Cities and towns should be seen \nas market agents, just like firms and farms, serving market needs\u2019 (WDR09, 145). The \neconomic reductionism of the WDR09 borders on the ridiculous if it were not for the power of \nthe World Bank recommending policies that could be hazardous in a period of global climate \nchange, economic upheaval and rising political tension in many parts of the developing \nworld. Under the prevailing circumstances, the myopia of the WDR09 agglomeration fetish is \nworryingly irresponsible.  \nSince the early 1980s the developing world, particularly in Sub Saharan Africa, has \nexperienced the direct intervention of the World Bank in national policy formulation. \nMeanwhile the annual World Development reports have set the fashion, authoritatively \npresenting the latest economic development theories in technocratic terminology regardless \nof the concrete complexities of the lived experiences of populations in developing countries. \nMany of the World Bank\u2019s past analytical constructs are now disregarded in development \nstudies, and sometimes repudiated by former World Bank personnel (Stiglitz 2003), yet the \nconsequences of World Bank implementation of the misguided policies arising from their \nlatest orthodoxies persist, continuing to adversely affect the economic competitiveness and \nwelfare of the recipient populations in the developing world. \nA committee of economists led by the eminent Angus Deaton from Princeton University \nevaluated the World Bank in 2006, challenging the institution\u2019s reputation as the world\u2019s \n16 February 2010 \nknowledge bank, referring to its habit of taking: \u2018new and untested results as hard evidence \nthat its preferred policies work\u2019. The Deaton report singled out the flagship Wars as a \nmedium through which advocacy of the World Bank\u2019s favoured policy recommendations \nsometimes takes precedence over balanced analysis. This year\u2019s WDR falls squarely in this \ncategory. Further we need to question the World Bank\u2019s lack of accountability to people in \nthe developing world who experience the adverse consequences of implementing their latest \nWDR policy axioms. The World Bank insists on democratic governance in national \ngovernment in developing countries but they successfully evade these principles being \napplied to them in their role as the international governor of development policy. Something \nis very askew. Under these circumstances, perhaps it is fortuitous that the urban sector has \nbeen lucky to escape WDR analytical attention until the present. \nThis and each of the regional and thematic commentaries that follow represent the views of \nthe author rather than a shared perspective.  \n \n16 February 2010 \nWorld Development Report 2009 and Latin American Urbanization \nKatherine V. Gough  \nUrbanization in the global South has for too long been cast in a negative light by \ninternational and national development agencies. This is despite the strong correlation \nbetween levels of urbanization and economic growth. The positive slant taken by the World \nDevelopment Report 2009 (WDR) on urbanization is thus most welcome. As the UNFPA \n2007 State of the World Population Report, subtitled \u2018Unleashing the potential of urban \ngrowth\u2019, similarly highlighted, there are many positive aspects of urbanization including \neconomic, social, cultural and environmental. The claims of the WDR regarding urbanization \nand economic development, however, are far from unproblematic when considered from a \nLatin American perspective. This commentary is divided into three parts corresponding with \nthe tripartite division of the report, in each case focussing on the first chapter i.e. the \nchapters on \u2018Density\u2019,  \u2018Scale economies and agglomeration\u2019, and \u2018Concentration without \ncongestion\u2019.  \n \nPart 1 The facts \nThe WDR claims that density increases with urbanization, rapidly at first and then more \nslowly. Although living standards initially diverge between areas of different density, later \nthey converge and \u2018Even within cities, densely populated slums amid formal settlements, the \ndifferences slowly disappear with development\u2019 (WDR09, 49). Although density is defined as \nan \u2018economic mass or output generated on a unit of land\u2019 (WDR09, 49) the authors have a \ntendency to slide between using density in relation to the economy and density of population \n(place) which confuses their argument. Leaving this aside, if we turn to the USA, one of the \ncountries most frequently drawn upon in the report, the claim that \u2018within-urban disparities in \nwelfare narrow with development\u2019 (WDR09, 49) clearly does not hold. In Latin America, the \noverriding trend in cities is for increasing, not decreasing inequalities and associated rising \nsocio-spatial segregation.  \nIncome inequality in Latin American cities has increased significantly in recent decades. As \nJanice Perlman (2004, 30) has shown, building on detailed ethnographic work in Brazilian \nfavelas, \u2018while the poor have improved their standing in absolute terms they have lost \nground relative to the rest of the population\u2019. Rather than inequalities disappearing with \ngrowth, Latin American cities are characterised by increased spatial segregation with the \nrich having an increased ability to segregate themselves from the poor. Gated communities, \nwhere fences, gates and armed guards mark spatial segregation, and in the large Latin \n16 February 2010 \nAmerican metropolises even fenced cities housing up to 50,000 people, have emerged. As \nAxel Borsdorf et al. (2007, 366) argue, \u2018These residential spaces form a central element of \nthe new model of the space organization of the Latin American cities \u2026 and are one \ncontemporary expression of the inequality and exclusion that have characterized the \nresidential areas of the Latin American cities from their initial formation.\u2019  \n \nOne of the driving forces behind this increased segregation is the rising fear of violence, \nwhich is linked to the increasing inequality. Urban violence is central to understanding \nurbanization as it not only acts as a considerable barrier to development, but the \ndevelopment process itself is instrumental in both producing and shaping new forms of \nurban violence (Winton 2004). As Caroline Moser (2004) has argued, urban space in Latin \nAmerica is being reorganized in response to two interrelated issues: the heightened levels of \ncrime and violence, and the lack of confidence in the state\u2019s capacity to provide effective \npolice security resulting in socio-spatial exclusion and segregation. This totally contradicts \nthe image of increasing harmony projected by the report. \n \nPart 2 The insights \nDrawing on the concepts promoted by the \u2018new economic geography\u2019 approach, the WDR \nfocuses on benefits of scale economies and agglomeration focussing almost exclusively on \nformal urban economies. The claim picked up on here is that \u2018Among mature industries the \npersistence in employment patterns across cities is high over time\u2019 (WDR09, 139). This \nclearly does not apply to most Latin American cities, which are characterised by an \nincreasing informalization of the economy with consequent implications for the labour \nmarket. Neoliberalism, with its associated policies of liberalization, privatization, and \nderegulation, has resulted in deindustrialization and the reorganization and relocation of \nproduction and consumption activities. This has transformed the nature of work and \nincreased the polarization in occupational structure and incomes with profound \nconsequences for social and economic organisation (Roberts 2005).   \nAs in other parts of the world, the labour force has grown at a faster rate than formal \nemployment resulting in 80 percent of job creation in Latin America being in the informal \neconomy during the 1980s and 1990s (Tokman 2001 cited in Biles 2008). Drawing on \nstudies conducted in Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Montevideo and Santiago, Bryan Roberts \n(2005) shows how the situation of the economically active population deteriorated during the \n1990s with vulnerability to poverty increasing correspondingly. Women in particular have \n16 February 2010 \nmore insecure working conditions today than several decades ago (Perlman 2004). Latin \nAmerican cities are characterised as having: reduced public sector employment, increased \noutsourcing and subcontracting, more precarious \u2018flexible\u2019 employment, increased \nparticipation of women in the workforce, and higher rates of underemployment and \nunemployment (Biles 2008). The powerful drivers for urban development are thus \u2018economic \ntransformation, deregulation, a retreat of the state, weakening of urban planning, but also \nthe rise of (internationally organised) crime and  \u2026 the perception of vulnerability by the \ncitizens\u2019 (Borsdorf et al. 2007). This is a far cry from the picture of urban economies \npresented in the report. \n \nPart 3 The policy framework \nThe WDR has the tendency to be highly selective in its use of supporting evidence, both \ncontemporary and historical (Rigg et al. 2009). In relation to its housing policy proposals, \nCosta Rica is heralded as being a \u2018model for other developing countries\u2019 (WDR09, 214). \nWhilst not denying that countries can learn from each others\u2019 experiences, no policy can be \nused as a blueprint for another; as is argued elsewhere in the report, place matters. The \nsuccessful policies named in relation to dealing with low-income housing are taken from \nSweden and the USA in the 1930s-1970s, which entailed demolishing and building \nreplacement homes. However, not only can the very differing situations of Sweden and the \nUSA not be transferred to Latin American cities today, there is a real danger of lumping all \ninformal housing together under the label of \u2018slums\u2019 (see Gilbert 2007 - whose dislike of the \nreturn of the term \u2018slum\u2019 I share). As has long been reported for Latin America, dating back \nto the pioneering work of John Turner in the 1960s and 1970s, housing in informal \nsettlements tends to be consolidated over the years and is often a solution rather than the \nproblem.  \nIn the WDR\u2019s policy proposals relating to slums, the \u2018correct approach\u2019 is seen as being \n\u2018integration of slums into the broader urban economy\u2019 (WDR09, 227). Here again there is a \nslippage between economy and place, but the overall sentiment is shared, as are proposals \nfor settlement upgrading. However, the authors continue by proposing that \u2018if the problem is \nspatial inefficiency, steps to improve land use efficiency and compensate slum dwellers for \ndisruptions to their livelihoods probably should take precedence\u2019 (WDR09, 227-228). This \nprovides a carte blanche for governments to remove informal settlements, the severe \nconsequences of which for their inhabitants have been demonstrated countless times \nbefore.  \n16 February 2010 \nTo conclude, whilst the highlighting of some of the positive aspects of urbanization by the \nWDR is applauded, there are serious concerns regarding the facts, insights and policy \nrecommendations it contains. The deliberate omission of any analysis of the social effects of \na changing economic geography (as stated on page 34) results in central aspects of \nurbanization, including rising violence and the associated socio-spatial exclusion and \nsegregation being overlooked. The misleading representation of the urban economy results \nin an incorrect analysis of the underlying processes and nature of urbanization. Not \nsurprisingly then, and most worryingly, the policy suggestions are highly problematic and \npotentially harmful. \n \n \n16 February 2010 \nWorld Development Report and Asian Urbanization \n \nJonathan Rigg  \n \nWDR2009 contains a good deal of discussion of Asian urbanization and agglomeration. \nBroadly speaking, the experience of Asia is presented as positive and worthy of emulation. \nTo support this, there is detailed, adroit and sometimes finely-crafted discussion from the \nworld city of Singapore through to transport in Bangkok, rural-urban integration in China, and \ncity-to-city connectivities in Japan. The Report is, at first glance, impressively broad in its \ncoverage of Asian countries and cases. \n \nFor many geographers, however, the Report also embraces an uncomfortable, albeit hidden, \nteleology that, in summary, takes it for granted that reducing distance, easing division and \nencouraging density will deliver economic growth and, therefore, development. In making its \ncase, the Report adopts three approaches which are regarded here as problematic. First of \nall, the Report generally avoids examples and evidence that might challenge the argument \nthe Report seeks to make; second, the Report narrows the focus of concern to the \neconomics of concentration (urbanization), and in large part fails to confront the social and \neconomic implications and outcomes of the processes that are addressed; and third, the \nReport does not sufficiently entertain the possibility that urbanization processes and \ntransitions are importantly different between countries, regions and cases.   \n \nPerhaps the most striking statement in the whole report is contained in a box with the title, \n\u2018What this report is not about\u2019: \u2018To keep the Report focused, several important aspects of the \nspatial transformations do not get the attention they would in a fuller study. The main \naspects not considered \u2013 except when emphasizing or qualifying the most important \nmessages \u2013 are the social and environmental effects of a changing economic geography\u2019 \n(WDR09: 34 [emphasis in original]). This means that cities tend to be portrayed in the Report \nas spaces of economic activity which generate growth, create wealth and reduce poverty. \nThe implication seems to be that social and environmental effects are distractions, rather \nthan central elements in building an understanding of what shapes cities beyond economic \nforces on the one hand, and what effects city growth and agglomeration economies have on \nthe other. \n \nA more inclusive vision would, for example, have done more to explore the manner in which \nrural and urban poverty and prosperity are co-constituted; it would have considered the \neffects of increasing levels of mobility as households become divided over space; and it \n16 February 2010 \nwould have been more explicit in its portrayal of the plight of urban migrant workers. Instead \nthe report provides a Panglossian vision of agglomeration economies in which migration is \nseen as a positive force for change. Singapore, Shenzhen and Sriperumbudur \u2018show how \nscale economies in production, movements of labor and capital, and falling transport costs \ninteract to produce rapid economic growth in cities and countries both large and small\u2019. \n\u2018These\u2019, the Report goes on to state, \u2018are the engine of any economy\u2019 (WDR09, 14). The \nmigration of millions of rural Chinese to the coastal provinces is presented in the report as a \npositive process, resulting in the matter-of-fact statement that \u2018Governments should facilitate \nlabor mobility\u2019 (WDR09, 18). \n \nThe result is that the authors of the Report feel able to make blanket assertions: \u2018Are the \npolicy messages of this Report anti-rural? No\u2019 (WDR09, 200). The \u2018rule\u2019 apparently, \u2018is \nsymbiosis\u2019 when it comes to relations between rural villages and different urban settlement \ntypes. This statement conveniently overlooks, for example, the literature on urban bias and \nthe debate over the virtuous cycle of rural-urban relations. To be sure, both debates are still \nvery much alive; with regard to urban bias, Corbridge and Jones note that while \u2018academics \nmay be notorious for sitting on the fence\u2026there is no case for opting for the urban bias \nthesis or its \u2018opposite\u2019 in the round and in all respects\u2019 (2005, 30). They go on to warn \nagainst forms \u2018of politics or public policy that steamroller over local realities in the name of \ntheoretical purity\u2026\u2019 (2005, 30). In this connection, the Report has three limitations: it limits \nits span of concern, largely, to the economic and gives the impression of viewing the social \nand environmental as merely incidental; it does not go far enough in looking for the links \nbetween urban and rural people, spaces and activities; and it eschews contrary views and \nevidence. \n \nIn addition to narrowing its object of concern fairly squarely to economics, the Report also \nprovide a universalist account of urban transitions. The possibility that urban transitions in \nvarious parts of the world may be importantly different is not seriously considered. For Grant \nand Nijman (2002), their study of cross-continental urban comparison \u2018shows that the \neconomic geography of present-day cities in the less-developed world is fundamentally \ndifferent from that of \u2018Third World cities\u2019 and from globalizing cities in the West\u2019 (2002, 328 \n[emphasis in original]). \n \nThe necessity to consider the possibility of difference is particularly apposite when it comes \nto Asia because there has been a rich debate over the specificities of Asian urbanization \nprocesses. In a recent study of cities and urbanization in China, the authors conclude that \n16 February 2010 \n\u2018the Chinese urban experience will lead to new ways of thinking about the urbanization \nprocess\u2026\u2019 (McGee et al. 2007, 199). That possibility is not present here. \n \nBecause of the restricted way in which the Report selects and sieves its evidence, Chapter 7 \non \u2018Concentration without congestion: managing an integrated portfolio of places\u2019 ignores \nthe extensive literature on Asian extended metropolitan regions (EMRs) initiated by the \ngeographer Terry McGee (McGee 1989, 1991, 2003, McGee and Greenberg 1992, Koppel \n1991, Jones 1997, Webster 2005). This is all the more surprising because McGee and his \nfollowers\u2019 work specifically addresses many of the spatial aspects of integration and \ninteraction which the Report seeks to illuminate. Moreover, it does so in a way that might \nhave injected more of a sense of nuance and contingency into the discussion. McGee, for \nexample, critiques the way in which technology has become the scaffold for understanding \nchange in Southeast Asian cities, \u2018lead[ing] to a distorted view of Southeast Asian \ndevelopment, in which the roles of state and local actors are subordinated to the global \nimpact\u2019 (McGee 2007: 278). \u2018My problem\u2019, McGee writes, with such \u2018approaches is that they \nare too one-dimensional and too unidirectional\u2019 (2007, 278).  \n \nWhat does this mean? It means that certain spaces of activity (the interstitial urban [and \nrural] spaces that are not easily measured and captured), certain processes (those that fall \noutside of the ambit of normal study), certain interactions (as noted above), and certain \npeople (the poor, the marginalised, the uncounted, the unrecorded) become pushed to one \nside. The framing of economic geography that is adopted in WDR09 in which the economic \ntakes precedent over the non-economic, the statistical over the \u2018anecdotal\u2019, the technical and \nthe instrumental over the oral and the informal, and the expert over the non-expert plays a \nsignificant role in shaping the views and positions that are presented. It is true, of course, \nthat all research has to make choices; but recognising the influence of these choices is \ncritical. At the extreme, framings can create the justification for policy interventions that may \nbe inimical to the interests of certain groups \u2013 who are usually the poor, the powerless, the \ninvisible and the uncounted. It is striking how far this report differs in its tone and philosophy \nfrom WDR2000\/01 \u2018Attacking poverty\u2019 which privileges the personal, the anecdotal, the \nparticipatory and the local (World Bank 2000).  \n \nThis is not to suggest that the World Bank in general and the authors of the Report in \nparticular are not cognisant of inequality, but rather to note the way in which the approach \nadopted in the Report inexorably leads towards a set of positions. The overview, for \nexample, states: \n \n16 February 2010 \n\u2018Concern for these intersecting 3 billion [poorest and most vulnerable] sometimes comes \nwith the prescription that economic growth must be made more spatially balanced. The \ngrowth of cities must be controlled. Rural-urban gaps in wealth must be reduced quickly. \nLagging areas and provinces distant from domestic and world markets must be sustained \nthrough territorial development programs that bring jobs to the people living there. \u2026 \nWorld Development Report 2009 has a different message: economic growth is seldom \nbalanced. Efforts to spread it prematurely will jeopardize progress\u2019 (WDR09, 5-6). \n \n \n16 February 2010 \nWorld Development Report 2009 and Sub-Saharan African Urbanization: \nIgnoring African Exceptionalism \n \nDeborah Fahy Bryceson  \nThe WDR09 adopts a conventional interpretation of urbanization, associating it with \nindustrialization. This is a reasonably valid assumption for Asia at present and Latin America \nin the past but it has never been a significant factor in African urbanization. Africa\u2019s \nindustrialization was fostered by nationalist government support for import-substitution \nindustries in the immediate aftermath of the national independence era of the 1960s and \nearly 1970s. African industrial development had yet to take off before the oil crises of the \n1970s struck. Structural adjustment and economic liberalization policies eroded African \nindustrial viability. By the 1990s most countries\u2019 urban industrial sectors had become \ninconsequential.  \nNonetheless, Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced an exceptionally strong urbanization \ntrend over the last three decades, not generally associated with economic growth or \nindustrialization (Bryceson 2006). In fact, the continent has been gripped by economic \nmalaise, despite western donor agencies\u2019 concentrated aid expenditure and the World \nBank\u2019s dominating influence on national economic policy formulation. African urbanization \ntrends directly contradict NEG theory, which associates urban agglomeration with economic \ngrowth. UN Habitat (2008, 106) describes African urbanization as a \u2018widespread poverty-\ndriven economic survival strategy\u2019. How can Africa\u2019s rapid urban growth in the face of \ndeepening poverty be explained?  \nThe WDR 09 tries to sidestep the yawning gap between theory and reality by casting doubt \non African urban population statistics and reducing the sample for their analysis of \ncorrelation between urban growth and industrialization to a mere 10 countries out of over 50 \n(WDR09, 59). On the basis of this cosseted sample, they claim there is evidence for \u2018Africa\u2019s \nurbanization reflect[ing] industrialization\u2019 and economic growth \u2013 in direct contradiction to \nUN-Habitat\u2019s (2008) experienced eye assessing the nature of African urban growth. By \navoiding citation of data that would undermine the explanatory power of NEG agglomeration \ntheory, the Report deflects the reader\u2019s attention from the real causes of rapid urbanization \nin Africa (Bryceson 2002).  \nThe reliability of African urban population data differs from country to country. What is readily \napparent is that the rural percentage of national populations is, as acknowledged in last \nyear\u2019s WDR08, declining. Africa is deagrarianizing and people are seeking non-agricultural \nlivelihoods in a variety of places and at various rungs of the urban hierarchy. The rates at \n16 February 2010 \nwhich they are doing so vary from country to country, but they have been generally high for \nthe last three decades. Given the depressed state of peasant agriculture, it is unlikely this \ntrend will change until countries reach the point at which their countryside has aged and \nrural areas become underpopulated. \nIn the Report, the \u2018drivers of urbanization\u2019 are conceptualized as \u2018the market forces of \nagglomeration, migration and specialization - and the policies that help or hinder them\u2019 \n(WDR09, 158). It is pertinent to consider the policy trajectory in Sub-Saharan Africa in this \nregard. In the 1970s, African nation-states\u2019 agrarian economies were crippled by rising fuel \ncosts that undermined the competitiveness of their agricultural exports and caused them to \nfall heavily into debt. The WDR09 stresses the significance of the historical decline in global \ntransport costs for agglomeration tendencies but, while noting the continent\u2019s relatively high \ntransport costs, it does not acknowledge the structural dislocation of African national \neconomies connected with the sudden oil price rises of the 1970s. Since then Sub-Saharan \nAfrican economic policy formulation has been subject to western international financial \ninstitutions and donor agencies\u2019 aid conditionality. African sovereignty in national economic \npolicy-making has yet to be regained, with the exception of South Africa and Botswana \nwhose solvency and middle-income country status have afforded them the scope to set their \nown policies. African peasant agriculture, which had absorbed the efforts of the majority of \nthe population in almost all countries, deteriorated under structural adjustment\u2019s lack of \ninvestment in it and economic liberalization policies which exposed a then weakened \npeasant agricultural sector to the rigours of world competition.  \nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, migration has driven the expansion of cities, but it is the \u2018push\u2019 of \nrural instead of the \u2018pull\u2019 of urban areas that has dominated. Agrarian involution rather than \nrising productivity in urban settlements has spurred African urban migration. The dominant \ntendency within rural and urban areas of Africa has been economic diversification not \nspecialization, in response to the exceptionally high-risk environment that producers have \nfaced. African urban areas, relative to other urbanized parts of the world, do not evince high \nlevels of economic specialization. The burgeoning literature on African \u2018urban agriculture\u2019 is \nindicative of the subsistence nature of large spheres of urban economic activities (Foeken \n2006, Smith 1999). \nMost migrants entering the urban informal sector engage in low-income earning trade and \nservice sector work and find makeshift housing in the extensive slum areas of African cities, \nmigrating from rural home areas where income-earning prospects are even more meagre. \nTheir aggregation in cities represents a concentration of poverty rather than productivity. The \nWDR09 averts confronting the fact that urbanization in labour-abundant, capital-deficient \n16 February 2010 \nareas will not generate the same economic dynamism as in countries where labour and \ncapital assets are more balanced. \nAfrican countries now have a broad range of urban settlement sizes from rapidly growing \nrural mining settlements that become towns in form and function over the space of months to \nlarge megacities including Johannesburg, Luanda, Kinshasa and Lagos. Luanda has been \ngrowing at over 6 per cent per annum. It is anticipated that by 2015, Kinshasa and Lagos will \nhave entered the league of top 20 largest cities in the world at 17th and 19th places \nrespectively (UN-Habitat 2008, 6).  \nRegardless of the enormous spectrum of urban sizes and historical specificities of African \nurban settlements, the WDR09 reduces urban diversity into a mechanical policy matrix \nbased on scale (level of agglomeration) and changing \u2018dimension\u2019, offering a staged \nprogression of policies as urban scale increases, reserving urban investment policies \nprimarily for high-density cities. This is seen as logical, leaving the market to find optimal \nurban sites for private investment and determine the economically viable size of cities. The \nWDR09 advocates avoidance of spatial policy intervention through the administration of \n\u2018spatially blind\u2019 policies where development investment of basic service infrastructure, e.g. \nhealth care, education, water provisioning in line with the millennium development goals is \ngeneralized regardless of the presence of rural or urban populations. This approach does \nnot take account of: 1) the exceptionally rapid rate of urban growth in many African \ncities\/countries, 2) the specific resource constraints or opportunities of incipient and \nintermediate cities, and 3) the growing stimulus of mining in African urban development \nwhich poses special environmental and social problems. Mining settlements can grow very \nrapidly from small, deep rural to urban agglomerations of considerable size (Bryceson and \nYankson 2009). \nThe reality is that infrastructure provisioning is not uniform over space nor between rural and \nurban areas. Assuming that the market determines city location and rates of growth neutrally \nin the absence of powerful vested interests masks the inequities embedded in urbanization \nas a political process, and is likely to fuel rather than temper political instability and spatial \nwelfare imbalances further. The economic dynamism of incipient urban settlements is \nusually accompanied by extreme wealth differentiating tendencies and potential discord. \nGovernments cannot afford to ignore such settlements in their spatial policy formulation \ndespite their relatively small size. Furthermore, at all scales of urban agglomeration, the \ncomplex challenges of ethnic relations cannot be overlooked in a continent where the \nplurality of ethnic groups is marked and sometimes prone to violence.  \n16 February 2010 \nThe WDR09\u2019s laissez-faire approach to urban agglomeration discounts the urgency of \nAfrican governments at local, municipal, regional and national level having a vision of the \ndesired direction of urban change with informed and flexible plans. By contrast, African \nurban migrants have a vision and high expectations spurred by their dissatisfaction with rural \nconditions. The major governance problem for African states and local governments is that \ntheir urban expectations and search for alternative livelihoods to rural farming are frequently \nnot secured in the city.  \nSeveral undesirable trends are likely to coalesce. Unplanned urban growth has no feedback \nmechanisms. Urban growth becomes encrusted with the economic disappointment and \nsocial tension of expanding, spatially concentrated populations. Insufficient urban \ninfrastructure and services leads to entrenched class bias in service provisioning. Adverse \nenvironmental outcomes associated with unplanned urbanization proliferate causing hazards \nto urban residents. Meanwhile energy expenditure levels climb as growing numbers adopt \nan urban lifestyle. Transport gridlock looms in the absence of offsetting measures. Rising \nunemployment levels feeds the proliferation of slums and crime. Economic frustration and \nsocial discord emerges that Africa\u2019s weak nation-states cannot contain.  \nIncreasingly African political strife and civil war centres on cities. Witness the sudden \noutbreak of ethnic conflict in Kenya\u2019s urban slums after the country\u2019s national elections in \nJanuary 2008. And then there is Mogadishu where unprecedented urban migration fuelled \nby rural distress and famine during the 1980s was the prelude to a civil war that has \nsimmered and then vigorously boiled on and off to the present with disastrous loss to human \nlife, urban civility and the undermining of the Somali nation-state.  \nThe WDR09\u2019s enthusiasm for the economic invigoration of urbanization lacks an \nappreciation of the cultural, social and political forces that are unleashed by rapid \nurbanization in Sub-Saharan Africa. Without attempts at balancing state, market and \ncommunity efforts to ensure socially harmonious and politically viable urbanization at all \nstages of the process in Sub Saharan Africa, it is inevitable that urban agglomeration will \ngenerate relatively more economic misery than growth for the continent.  \n16 February 2010 \nAgglomeration, migration and the geographical concentration of labour \n \nJytte Agergaard \n \n\u2018Labor mobility and voluntary migration for economic gain are the human side \nof the agglomeration story\u2019 (p. 158) \n \nAt the heart of the WDR\u2019s concept of agglomeration is density of population and economic \nactivity, and in order to secure population density, mobility of capital, and resources, \npeople\u2019s migration is essential. Factor mobility issues are discussed in Chapters 5 and 6 of \nthe Report. Chapter 5 focuses on the relationship between economic growth and labour \nmobility, highlighting how the concentration of economic activity is stimulated by migrants. \nThe subsequent chapter concentrates on economic and material flows and how economic \nactivities are stimulated by the changing landscape of connectivity in relation to decreasing \ntransportation costs and increasing communication facilities (what geographers normally \nrefer to as \u2018time-space compression\u2019, cf. Harvey 1990). While Chapter 5 advocates removal \nof barriers to internal and international migration of labour, Chapter 6 argues for \ninfrastructural investments, liberalization of transport in order to lower transport costs, and \nremoval of other trade barriers in accordance with the WTO\u2019s latest suggestions for policy \nreform (WDR09, 188). \nMigration researchers, not least the ones concerned with migration and mobility in the global \nSouth, have long argued for a more positive interpretation of internal migration \nacknowledging that people are increasingly living mobile lives, and that households\u2019 \nlivelihoods span rural and urban space (rural-urban linkages). For example, Robin Cohen \nputs forward a cogent pro-migration position in his book, Migration and its enemies (2006). \nThe WDR\u2019s focus and positive attitude towards migration and migrants is to be welcomed. \nHowever, not all migration is interpreted as positive. In making a distinction between \u2018good\u2019 \nand \u2018bad\u2019 migration, the WDR is operating with two main dichotomies: the first being \nbetween skilled and un-skilled migrants; and the second between migration for economic \nreasons and migration to improve access to public services. The WDR09 views positive \nmigration as the migration of skilled migrants moving for economic reasons internally to \nurban areas, part of the national agglomeration processes that will provide \u2018knowledge \nspillovers\u2019 and investments in human capital (education). On the other hand, if the same \nmigrants move overseas to the benefit of other nations\u2019 agglomeration, this mobility is less \n16 February 2010 \npositive and risks loss of human capital. When it comes to unskilled migrants their mobility to \nagglomerations within the country is interpreted as mainly negative because they cannot \npartake effectively in the knowledge spillovers. However if they cross borders and remit \nearnings to their home community, their mobility is considered worthwhile:  \u2018the policy \nchallenge is not how to keep households from moving, but how to keep them moving for the \nwrong reasons\u2019 (WDR09, 147). \nThe theoretical construction behind this valuation of migration and mobility is Lucas Jr.\u2019s re-\nworking of Arthur Lewis\u2019s two-sector model (1958), which assumes that due to comparative \nlabour costs, labour will flow from the subsistence sector in undeveloped economies to the \nmodern sector in the developed economies. In Lucas Jr.\u2019s version (1988, 2004), Lewis\u2019 work \nfrom the 1950s is combined with later growth theory and focus on urban agglomeration \neconomies. While most commentators would accept that differences in size and content of \neconomies impact on the direction of migration flows, the suggestion that this economic \nmodel can inform us about who moves and who stays behind is much more problematic. \nThe WDR09\u2019s explanation of why current trends in migration and mobility do not follow \nLewis\u2019s and Lucas Jr.\u2019s theoretical insights is that the \u2018market\u2019 for migration is imperfect: \ngovernments impose barriers to free mobility, and the transport sector does not function \neffectively. While, is likely to stimulate migration, insisting on an imperfect market theory as a \ngeneralized theoretical framework ignores the bulk of academic analyses of \nmigration\/mobility and development over many decades (see Rigg 2007 for a summary). At \nleast three central characteristics of migration dynamics are suppressed. First, most \npotential migrants weigh a number of different aspects of their lives, not least their family \ncircumstances when making the decision of moving or staying put. Second, most people, \nespecially in the global South, are part of a bigger decision-making unit, notably their \nhouseholds. Decisions that are \u2018rational\u2019 in a household context might be less logically \ncoherent from an individual point of view. Third, family networks and networking are often \ndecisive for giving direction and help to migrants when moving and settling.  \nReturning to the means for supporting the \u2018good\u2019 migration and halting the \u2018bad\u2019 migration a \ndelicate issue emerges: even if it is possible to encourage more people to move for \neconomic reasons, is it possible to make the so-called non-economic migrants stay put? In \nthe WDR09, lack of social investments notably in education and health, in peripheral areas \nprovides the answer. However, if social investments prevent unskilled people from leaving \ntheir home in the periphery due to their ill health or lack of education, then deficiency of \nsocial services is likely to be the main reason why they move. The WDR09\u2019s presentation of \nevidence is somewhat distorted.  \n16 February 2010 \n \nA great deal of empirical evidence suggests, that increasing migration to urban areas in \nmany regions of Africa and Asia is closely linked to the increasing sway of a youth culture \namongst rural youth who choose to move to become \u2018modern\u2019 (Tranberg et al. 2008; Gough \n2008). Hence, local improvement of rural health services and better schooling might not \ncompensate for the feeling of living in the periphery. Young people may not want to wait until \nthey have become \u2018skilled\u2019 through education in the rural context. And then there is the \ndifficulty of delivering high quality education to the periphery in countries of the global South \nwith no tradition for universal education. Hence, even where decentralized education \nfacilities are being given investment priority, this is a long term strategy which in the short \nrun may not succeed in preventing ambitious young people, usually supported by their \nparents, to seek opportunity in the city rather than staying put to achieve and apply their \nskills in the periphery. \nThis brings us to a more fundamental doubt: is it only migration for agglomeration purposes \nin the modern sector that needs to be supported? While the division between \u2018good\u2019 and \n\u2018bad\u2019 mobility fits well into the ideal two-sector model of factor mobility and agglomeration \ndynamics, it does not shed light and may even distort our understanding of how migration \nand mobility contribute to a growing number of households\u2019 efforts to improve their \nlivelihoods and living standards in the global South. As stated by the WDR09\u2019s own main \nsource on migration, Deshingkar and Grimm (2005), the spatial and temporal patterns of \nmigration vary greatly by region. Migration to cities has increased considerably in recent \nyears, but rural-to-rural migration in many countries of Asia and Africa still dominates. Rural-\nto-rural migrants\u2019 remittances and flexible migration practices provide a valuable safety net \nfor many rural households and may \u2018prevent\u2019 an escalation of migration to city areas for the \n\u2018wrong reasons\u2019. Hence, economic activities in the periphery do play an important role not \nonly for migrants and rural incomes but also for national incomes. The WDR tends to \noverlook that the dynamic national economies in Southeast Asia, notably Thailand and \nVietnam, base their success not only on attracting foreign capital and modern industrial \ninvestment, but also on developing rural employment opportunities and commercial \nagriculture (Agergaard 2009). Commercial agriculture is also of considerable importance in \nmany African economies, not least pre-SAP, but also the mining sector (small-scale as well \nas large-scale) has proven to drive important non-metropolitan economic development \n(Bryceson and Yankson 2009). Hence, in situ or rural based urbanization, often highly \nstimulated by migrants and mobile livelihoods seems to be a parallel development path to \nthe one led by urban agglomeration. \n16 February 2010 \n \nSo while I acknowledge the WDR09\u2019s emphasis on seeing migration as a societal benefit \nrather than an evil, I question the usefulness of seeing migration and economic activities \nfrom such a dualistic perspective, depicting the so-called peripheries as labour reserves \nwhile supporting economic activities in the centres of population agglomeration. In taking this \nexceptionally old-fashioned dichotomized view of rural and urban areas, the inference \nseems to be that economic development in the global South is only possible if reproduction \ncosts (supporting children, mothers, disabled and old persons) are left to the rural areas? \nWhere are the linkages between \u2018traditional\u2019 rural and \u2018modern\u2019 urban economic activities \nimpacting on employment and regional and urban growth? Hence, I would argue that the \nlinks between urbanization and migration consist of much more than knowledge spillovers \nfor the benefit of a progressive modern (industrialized) sector. \n \n16 February 2010 \nReferences \nAgergaard, J. 2009, \u2018Living from coffee in Vietnam\u2019s Central Highlands: Susceptible \nlivelihoods and diverse settlement transformation\u2019 in Agergaard et al.  \nAgergaard, J., N.
