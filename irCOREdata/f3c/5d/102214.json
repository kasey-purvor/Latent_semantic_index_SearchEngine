Within the polymer composites literature there are many papers \nconcerned with the selection or modification of the matrix in order to optimise the \ntoughness of the composite.  The development of intrinsically tough matrices \n(thermoplastics and modified thermosets), the use of resin interleaves between plies and \nthe addition of secondary reinforcement, such as silicon carbide whisker or carbon beads \nare examples of methods investigated for the toughening of polymer matrix composites \n[1-10]. \n \nIn recent years, organic-inorganic hybrids have been developed with potential \napplications in a range of technologies including sensors [11] and lasers [12,13].  \nOrganically modified silicas (ormosils) are one type of organic-inorganic hybrid [11].  \nThe present work is part of a programme to investigate the efficacy of a range of ormosils \n(in nano-particulate form) as modifiers for polymers and polymer matrix composites [14-\n18].  This paper considers the effects of these particles on the toughness of a polyester \nresin.  To understand the effect that the ormosils have on the matrix system it is important \nto appreciate the interaction between the ormosils and the matrix.  This has been \ninvestigated in an associated paper [18] in which it has been shown that: \n\u2022 the organic functionality replaces some of the silanol functionality at the surface \nof the silica particles \n\u2022 the methyl, ethyl and vinyl functionalities are sufficiently densely packed that they \ncan be considered as a monolayer that prevents the retained silanol groups from \ninteracting with chemical probes or the polymer matrix \n\u2022 the larger phenyl groups are less densely packed and allow retained silanol groups \nto interact \n\u2022 the organic functionalities interact only weakly, if at all, with the resin system \n\u2022 with the exception of the phenyl modified silica, the ormosils are likely to act \nessentially as voids in the matrix   \n\u2022 the phenyl ormosil is more strongly bonded to the matrix, but the overall bonding \nis weak when compared to an unmodified silica. \n \nIn confidence                                                                                                    Draft copy, accepted April 2006 \n4 \nIn another paper [17] the dispersion of the particles into the polyester matrix was \ndiscussed together with some preliminary mechanical property data from Charpy impact \ntesting and compact tension (CT) testing.  The Charpy test was shown to be inconclusive \nin this instance.  The CT test showed that there was a significant difference between the \nmodified and unmodified silicas, but the data could not be used to quantify toughness \nproperties as it was evident that the modification of the polyester had lead to a greater \ndegree of plastic deformation, in all systems, than is permissible for an LEFM test.  In \nthis current paper the J-integral has been used to evaluate the toughness behaviour, and \nthe results presented are taken in the context of the surface analysis of the particles from \nthe previous work such that candidate toughening mechanisms are considered. \n \n \nEXPERIMENTAL \n \nMaterials \n \nMethyl, ethyl, vinyl and phenyl modified silica nano-particles (diameters are presented in \nTable 1) were produced using a modified St\u00f6ber (hydrolytic) route [14].  These were used \nas modifiers for a polyester matrix.  The polyester normally contains HDK N20 \n(Wacker), which is a commercial fumed silica, used as a thixotropic agent.  However, \nsamples of this resin, Crystic 2-406PA (Scott-Bader), an unsaturated polyester resin, were \nmade available without the fumed silica addition (designated PEs in this work) and it is \nthis resin that is used as the baseline for this investigation.  The polyester is cured with \nCatalyst M (Scott-Bader), a trade name for the initiator methyl ethyl ketone peroxide.  All \nthe samples described here were cured with 1 vol% initiator and were post-cured at 80oC \nfor 3 hours. \n \nA description of the process used to disperse the particles in the polyester is presented in a \nprevious paper [17].  A range of different methods were trialled.  The most effective \nmethod found was to disperse the particles in a small quantity of ethanol.  The quantity of \normosil used was chosen to give a concentration of 1 vol% in the modified polyester \nplaque.  After dispersion, the ormosil\/ethanol mixture is added to a solution of \napproximately 50 vol% polyester and 50 vol% ethanol (a total of 100 ml of ethanol is \nIn confidence                                                                                                    Draft copy, accepted April 2006 \n5 \nnormally suitable for 5 g of ormosil) and the solution is then sonicated.  Further polyester \nis added, whilst this solution is still sonicated, until the solution is approximately 90 vol% \npolyester and 10 vol% ethanol.  Finally this solution is added to the bulk polyester and \nstirred thoroughly.  The ethanol is then removed through a vacuum oven (taking \napproximately 24 hours) and lost styrene is subsequently replaced. The quantity of \nstyrene to be replaced was calculated by weighing the sample before the ethanol was \nadded and after the resin was removed from the vacuum oven, taking into account the \nmass of the particles added. \n \nMechanical Characterisation \n \nPrevious work [17] has shown that there is considerable non-linearity in the \nload\/extension behaviour of these nano-composites.  It has therefore been necessary to \nuse J-integral methods to assess the toughness of the nano-composites.  The test method \nis outlined in ASTM E1737-96.  A double edge notched (DEN) specimen geometry was \nused with dimensions of 150 x 20 x 3 mm.  Samples were tested in tension using an \nInstron 1175 (with 5500R upgrade) tensile testing machine under displacement control.  \nThe load was measured directly from the 5 kN load cell and displacement were measured \nusing an extensometer of gauge length 50 mm.  The test method requires first that the \ncompliance is measured as a function of crack length.  The compliance was determined \nby loading the sample to 0.1 % strain at a given crack length, unloading and repeating this \ncycle twice more for each crack length and then calculating the average value of \ncompliance.  The notch was then extended using a jeweller\u2019s saw, with a blade width of \n0.25 mm.  After the compliance calibration was completed, the critical load to fail the \nsamples at a number of crack lengths was measured.  For these tests the notch was \nsharpened and extended to the correct length by \u2018tapping\u2019, using a fresh razor blade.  The \ndata are presented in the form of nominal crack length, since the values are an average of \nseveral samples.  Individual values for the crack length may vary by less than \u00b1 0.25 mm.  \nThe data reduction method used was the \u2018single specimen method\u2019.  The single specimen \nmethod derives two qualities from the test data, the elastic, Jel, and the plastic, Jpl, \ncontributions to fracture.  These two components are dependent upon the test geometry \nand in the case of a DEN sample Jel may be determined from: \n \nIn confidence                                                                                                    Draft copy, accepted April 2006 \n6 \nda\ndC\nB\nPJ el 4\n2\n=                                                           1 \n \nwhilst Jpl may be determined using: \n \n)(\n*\naWB\nAJ pl\n\u2212\n=                                                      2 \n \nIn these expressions P is the maximum experimental load, B is the specimen thickness \nand dC\/da is the differential of the 4th order polynomial that describes the relationship \nbetween C, the compliance of the sample, and a, the crack length.  A* is the area \ndescribed by the relation between stress and strain and a straight line between the origin \nand the maximum load.  W, in the case of a DEN specimen, is half the total width of the \nspecimen.  A test rate of 0.5 mm\/min was used and the test temperature was 25 oC. \n \nFractography \n \nThe fracture surfaces of the DEN specimens have been investigated using SEM (Hitachi \nS-4000).  The fracture surfaces and supporting material were removed from the bulk of \nthe specimen and mounted on standard stubs.  The samples were gold coated.  It has \nproved difficult to focus on individual particles as the sample becomes too highly \ncharged.  However, a range of magnifications are presented and these are sufficient to \nunderstand the toughening mechanisms and also to indicate the level of dispersion. \n \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nCompliance Data and Young`s Modulus for the Systems Tested \n \nFigure 1 shows the experimental data obtained for the relationship between compliance \nand crack length for the different ormosil containing systems and the unmodified (PEs) \nresin.  The phenyl ormosil has the greatest effect on the compliance with a smaller effect \ndue to the methyl, ethyl and vinyl ormosils; these last three systems are extremely close \nwith little to separate them.  From the compliance data for the uncracked samples, it is \nIn confidence                                                                                                    Draft copy, accepted April 2006 \n7 \npossible to determine the Young\u2019s Modulus of the materials.  These moduli are presented \nin Table 2.  It can be seen that there is a reduction in the moduli of the nano-composites \ncompared to the unmodified polyester, with the greatest reduction being observed in the \nphenyl ormosil modified polyester. \n \nFrom particulate theory it might be expected that the addition of a stiffer particulate phase \nwould lead to an increase in the Young\u2019s Modulus of the composite compared to the bulk \npolymer.  However, we must consider that we are dealing not with a \u2018conventional\u2019 filler \nbut with a nano-particle.  Hence even a comparatively nominal loading may be expected \nto significantly disrupt the matrix, due to the much greater number of particles than in a \nconventional filler system at the same volume fraction.  Further, when a particle interacts \nwith the matrix an interphase is produced of polymer affected by the particle.  Whilst this \ninteraction may have little or no effect, it is also possible that the self-interaction of the \npolymer may be affected.  It is therefore possible that the matrix is no longer the polyester \nper se, but rather a phase produced from the overlapping of the interphases associated \nwith each particle.  Under these circumstances the properties of the material may be \nexpected to be different from the unmodified material.  In the case of the methyl, ethyl \nand vinyl ormosils this interphase is likely to be limited or, possibly, effectively non-\nexistent.  In the case of the phenyl ormosil which has been shown to interact more \nstrongly with the resin, it is suggested that this interphase is likely to be not only present \nbut of a significant size. \n \nThe above arguments can be explored quantitatively in a simple way.  If we consider a \nunit cell, a cube, with particles placed at each corner such that the volume of one particle \nis contained within the cube then the spacing between the centre of two particles, C, will \nequal the diameter, 2r, of one particle plus the inter-particle spacing, i: \n \nC = 2r + i                                                         3 \n \nThe volume fraction of the particles, Vf, will therefore equal the volume of a particle \ndivided by the volume of one unit cell: \n \nIn confidence                                                                                                    Draft copy, accepted April 2006 \n8 \n3\n3\n3\n4\nC\nrV f\n\u03c0\n=                                                       4 \n \nRearranging for C: \n \n3\n3\n4\nfV\nrC \u03c0\u22c5=                                                    5 \n \nSince Vf in the case of these nano-composites is 0.01, we can estimate that C is \napproximately 7.5r and therefore that i is approximately 5.5r.  Since the average particle \nsize is 140 nm in diameter [14], i is, by calculation, around 380 nm [These calculations \nare consistent with features that could be identified on one of the fracture surfaces shown \nlater]. \n \n Interphases may range in size, with the norm lying in the range 20-200 nm [19].  In the \ncase of the phenyl modified silica the interphase may be expected to lie at the top end of \nthis range, or perhaps even outside.  Hence the argument regarding a modified interphase \naffecting large portions of the matrix appears reasonable.   \n \n \nToughness Data \n \nHaving determined the compliance of a material at a number of different crack lengths, it \nbecomes possible to determine J for a specimen.  Figures 2 and 3 consider the component \nelastic and plastic parts of J, Jel and Jpl respectively.  As can be seen both Jel and Jpl are \napproximately double for the phenyl modified resin system compared to both the other \nmodified resin systems and the unmodified system.  The relationship between J (=Jel+Jpl) \nand crack length based on the single specimen method is presented in Figure 4.  This is \npresented with the addition of horizontal lines of best fit, indicating the values of J that \nhave been determined and assuming that there is no dependence on initial crack length.  \nThese values are presented in Table 2.   \n \nIn confidence                                                                                                    Draft copy, accepted April 2006 \n9 \nThe value of the critical strain energy release rate, GC, was determined using compact \ntension type testing, before it was shown that there was significant non-linearity for the \nnano-composites.  The measured value of polyester GC for the unmodified system was \n140 \u00b1 70 J m-2, which agrees well with the value of J determined for the unmodified \npolyester and provides confidence in the methodology.  \n \nIt is apparent that none of the relationships in Figure 2 is entirely linear although the \nvalues should, in principle, be constant with crack length.  A slight increase in J is \nobserved with increasing crack length for the unmodified resin which cannot be \naccounted for.  The data for the modified resin systems do not show any systematic trend, \nhowever.  A possible explanation for the variation in toughness in the nano-composites is \nthat whilst the dispersion is good it is not entirely uniform.  A heterogeneous dispersion in \na cured sample would lead to localised differences in the material properties.  In these \ncircumstances a particular sample might in reality represent a significantly lower loading \nof ormosil, whilst another might represent a significantly larger loading of ormosil. \n \nFracture Surfaces \n \nThe fracture surfaces of DEN specimens have been examined using scanning electron \nmicroscopy and representative digital photomicrographs from areas on the fracture \nsurface ahead of the pre-crack are presented in Figures 5-7.  The unmodified and \nmodified resins are compared in Figure 6 and some particular features are highlighted in \nFigures 6 and 7.  The micrographs selected are those that best display the features \ndiscussed below: at lower magnifications it is difficult to make out the features discussed; \nwhilst at higher magnifications context is lost.  The unmodified resin (Figure 5a) presents \na typical smooth fracture surface, consistent with a brittle failure.  The surface features of \nthe modified resins (with the exception of the phenyl modified silica, Figures 5b-d) are \nreminiscent of the pattern observed following crack pinning by an inclusion or \ninhomogeneity.  This is consistent with the hypothesis that the particles are extremely \nweakly bonded, if at all, to the matrix, such that a likely toughening mechanism is that of \ncrack pinning [3,8].  A geometric consideration of the particles with relationship to the \ncrack and crack tip presents some conceptual problems with the hypothesis that \ntoughening is due to crack pinning.  This is also true of a number of other toughening \nmechanisms.  The actual toughening mechanism is of comparatively minor importance.  \nIn confidence                                                                                                    Draft copy, accepted April 2006 \n10 \nOf more interest is the observation that whatever the mechanism, it has only a modest \neffect on the toughness of the nano-composites produced using ethyl or vinyl ormosils \ncompared to the unmodified resins.  Crack pinning is consistent with the moderate \ntoughening effect observed from the incorporation of the methyl, ethyl and vinyl \nmodified silicas, together with photomicrographs which show a different surface feature \nto the hackling observed in the unmodified polyester (Figure 5a).  The phenyl ormosil \nmodified resin (Figure 5e) presents a surface with more crater-like surface features than \nare observed in the other samples.  This rougher fracture surface is indicative of a \ndifferent toughening mechanism, one in which the available evidence points to a degree \nof plastic deformation.  Some of this plastic deformation would be accounted for in the \ndebonding of the particle from the matrix, a process in which it is likely that the matrix \naround the particle becomes deformed.  In Figure 6 a surface feature is identified which \nhas only been seen in the methyl and ethyl modified silicas.  This type of feature may be \ndue to poor dispersion of the ormosils.  It is clearly different to the problematic air \nbubbles encountered during the initial dispersion trials [17].  It is possible that this feature \nrepresents agglomerates that have been interpenetrated by the polyester resin, but without \nsufficient agitation to break the agglomerate and hence this feature may be analogous to \nintercalation of clay platelets.  At this time this can only be considered as a possibility \nsince it has proven difficult to distinguish particles from the matrix.  In Figure 7b a digital \nphoto-micrograph is presented and it is believed that this shows particles within the \nmatrix and that the dispersion of the particles is quasi-homogenous through-out the \nmatrix.  The spacing of the features is consistent with the mean particle size and volume \nfraction.  However, it has not been possible to produce high quality digital photo-\nmicrographs of individual particles in any of the modified resins. \n \n \nMechanisms of Fracture: The Effect of Surface Chemistry \n \nConclusions, from another paper [18] regarding the surface chemistry of the ormosils and \ntheir interaction with a polyester, were presented at the beginning of this paper.  In \nparticular there is a difference between the phenyl ormosil and the other modified silicas.  \nThe phenyl ormosil has a surface structure that allows retained silanol groups to interact \nchemically with the resin system, whilst the surface structure of the methyl, ethyl and \nvinyl modified silicas do not allow retained silanol groups to interact.  In effect, apart \nIn confidence                                                                                                    Draft copy, accepted April 2006 \n11 \nfrom the phenyl modified silica, the surface chemistry of the ormosils is such that there is \nlittle if any interaction between the particles and the matrix.  Hence, these nano-particles \nwill behave in the manner of voids, as discussed by Lange [20].  These voids act to pin \nthe crack front.  Should there be any bonding between these ormosil nano-particles and \nthe matrix then this will be beneficial in that it will act to absorb energy, unlike the \nbonding between the commercial silica and the matrix, which can be considered too \nstrong: if bonding is too strong then a bonded particle would act to deflect the crack front \nto a minimally impeded path [4].  The bonding between the matrix and the phenyl ormosil \nnano-particles lies between that of the extremely strong bonding of the commercial silica \n(facilitated by the large numbers of silanol groups) and the extremely weak bonding of \nthe other ormosils.  In the case of the phenyl modified silica therefore, it is clear that there \nis a more complex process at work.   \n \nHuang and Kinloch [21] presented a summary of toughening by rubbery particles.  Of the \nmechanisms presented, the bridging mechanism presented is clearly specific to rubbery \nphases.  The cavitation of the rubbery particle would also seem to be a specific \nmechanism, but this could be deceptive.  It has been shown that hard particles can \nundergo a cavitation like process that is due to debonding of the particle from the matrix, \nas well as plastic deformation of the matrix around the particle [22].  Also, a more general \nform of toughening is localised shear band yielding.  This presents a significant option.  It \nis possible that the stronger bonding between the retained silanol groups and the polymer \nsystem allows localised shear band yielding to occur, whilst the disruption provided by \nthe phenyl modification prevents the matrix from becoming too strongly bonded to the \nparticle.  The weakly bonded particles are not easily fractured, but the dispersed stronger \nbonds anchor the matrix in place such that the matrix can plastically yield over a much \nlarger volume.   \n \nGiven the magnitude of improvement in the toughness of the phenyl ormosil modified \nresin it is probable that more extensive plastic deformation is taking place throughout the \nmatrix, in the form of shear, or dilatational, bands.  The inter-particle spacing is an \nimportant factor when determining the effectiveness of this type of toughening [19, 22-\n24].  Whilst a method of determining the critical spacing has not yet been determined, it \nhas been shown that there is an increase in toughness with a decrease in spacing.  This is \nattributed to a change in the stress state within the region of the ligament which changes \nIn confidence                                                                                                    Draft copy, accepted April 2006 \n12 \nfrom plane strain to plane stress, allowing more significant plastic deformation to take \nplace before failure. \n \nFurther, as argued above, when considering nano-particle modified systems, the scale of \nthe particles must be considered.  For a constant loading of particulates, the probability \nthat the interphases will interact in this manner increases as the particle size decreases.  \nHence, when dealing with nano-particles, even a modest volume fraction can lead to a \ncondition where there is interaction between the interphases associated with particles. \nUnder these circumstances the properties of the material may be expected to be different \nfrom the unmodified material.  In addition, over-lapping interphases are likely to carry \nout the localised shear band yielding, mentioned previously, and hence act on other \nparticles causing them to initiate localised shear bands, in such a manner that the process \nzone of plastically deformed material may become larger than might at first be expected. \n \nCONCLUDING REMARKS \n \nBy modifying the surface of silica nano-particles with organic functionalities it has been \npossible to show that there is a potential to tailor the acido-basic functionality to \nparticular needs.  In the current research, it has been shown that complete modification of \nthe surface, such that retained silanols are unable to interact with the polyester system \nleads to a slightly tougher system than the unmodified polyester.  A tougher nano-\ncomposite is produced, however, if the silanol groups are reduced (compared to an \nunmodified silica particle) but not entirely eliminated (as is the case with the phenyl \nmodified silica).  The difference in toughening mechanism is attributed to a difference in \nthe surface characteristics between the methyl, ethyl and vinyl ormosils (retained silanol \ngroups are unable to interact) and the phenyl ormosil (retained silanol groups are still able \nto interact). \nIn confidence                                                                                                    Draft copy, accepted April 2006 \n13 \nREFERENCES  \n \n1.E.H.
