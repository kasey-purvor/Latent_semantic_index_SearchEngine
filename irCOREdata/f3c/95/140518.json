At elevated temperatures, above\n900\uf0b0C (1650\uf0b0F), the coating oxidises to form a protective alumina scale. However, at\nlower temperatures this alumina scale does not reform rapidly enough to confer protection\nunder type II hot corrosion conditions. The coating is therefore designed with an\nintermediate chromium rich interlayer, which permits the rapid formation of chromia\nhealing areas of type II corrosion damage.\nLaboratory and burner rig tests have been carried out on a series of developmental smart\noverlay coatings. These have shown that the development of an intermediate chromium\nrich phase provides protection under low temperature hot corrosion conditions, while the\naluminium rich surface layer provides resistance to high temperature oxidation and type I\nhot corrosion. Thus the single application of \u201cSMARTCOAT\u201d permit operation over a\nbroad range of industrial and marine turbine conditions.\n2Introduction\nTo improve fuel efficiency and performance one has seen a steady, continuous increase in\nthe operating temperatures of the turbine sections of aero-, marine- and utility turbines over\nthe past 20 years. This temperature rise has been met by the intelligent use of materials\nwith increased temperature capability, through the use of advanced manufacturing\ntechnologies, including investment cast blades with improved cooling efficiencies and\nsingle crystal technology, and through the use of advanced coating systems [1-4].\nImprovements in coating technology have paralleled these engine developments, with the\naim of providing protection to these superalloy components from the increasing aggressive\n(higher temperatures, increased oxidation and corrosion rates, erosion) service\nenvironments. Thus, since the early 1960\u2019s one has seen the development of diffusion\ncoatings, MCrAlY overlay coatings, modified diffusion coatings \u2013 for example platinum\naluminides \u2013 and most recently thermal barrier coatings [4-8].\nSmart overlay coatings are the latest developments in environmental protection coatings.\nThey are chemically graded coatings, designed to provide an optimised corrosion response\nover a wide range of turbine operating conditions that are likely to be encountered in utility\nturbines, working with multi-fuel capability. The industrial driver is the design of high\nefficiency power plant, capable of operating on a wide range of fuels from natural gas,\nthrough kerosenes, diesel oils, residual oils and gaseous fuels made from coal, biomass and\nwaste, using combined cycle power plant technologies. The requirement is for extended\nduty cycles \u2013 up to 30,000h has been cited [9] \u2013 coupled with increased operating\ntemperatures. Under such service conditions the engine may experience high temperature\n3oxidation (>950\uf0b0C), type I hot corrosion (800-950\uf0b0C) and type II hot corrosion (650-800\uf0b0C)\nacross a single component.\nSmart coat technology has been designed to provide optimised protection to this mixed\nrange of environments loads.\nEnvironmental Protection Coatings\nHigh temperature environmental protection coatings are designed from the understanding of\noxidation and hot corrosion processes that has been developed over the last half century [10-\n14].\nHot corrosion problems (type I and type II hot corrosion, vanadic corrosion) are a direct\nresult of salt contaminants such as Na2SO4, NaCl and V2O5 which in combination produce\nlow melting point deposits which dissolve the protective surface oxides. A number of\nfluxing mechanisms has been proposed to account for the different corrosion morphologies\nthat are observed [12-14] and this has resulted in the general classification of high\ntemperature (type I, 800-950\uf0b0C), hot corrosion low temperature (type II, 600-800\uf0b0C) hot\ncorrosion and vanadic corrosion (535-950\uf0b0C). These corrosion processes can be separated\ninto an initiation and propagation stage. During the initiation stage the corrosion rate is\ncomparatively low as breakdown of the surface oxide occurs. However, once this has\nhappened and repair of the oxide is no longer possible, then the propagation phase results in\nthe rapid consumption of the alloy. Since the coating provides for the repair of the\nprotective surface oxide scales, the initiation stage can be extended, ideally for the design\nlife of the component. However, once coating penetration occurs, the propagation stage\noften results in catastrophic corrosion rates.\n4Thus fundamental understanding provides the science behind the SMARTCOAT concept:\nthe coating is designed to maintain a stable protective oxide, but if this oxide is breached it\nwill repair itself effectively to re-establish protection.\nAs a background to the development of SMARTCOAT technology, the corrosion\nperformance of a wide range of diffusion and overlay coatings, under high temperature\noxidation and type I and type II hot corrosion conditions have been extensively reviewed [8,\n15, 16]. The platinum modified aluminides performed exceptionally well under high\ntemperature oxidation conditions and in type I hot corrosion environments (800-950\uf0b0C)\n[17,18] but performed less well under type II hot corrosion conditions, although out\nperforming conventional aluminides [15,16]. Of the other diffusion coatings, the silicon\ncontaining diffusion aluminides (for example Sermetel 1515) perform well under type II hot\ncorrosion conditions. Chromised and chrome-aluminised coatings also offer protection\nunder type II corrosion conditions. Thus silicon containing and\/or chromium-rich diffusion\ncoatings offer improved corrosion resistance at the lower temperatures that are often\nencountered within utility turbine environments [16, 17, 19-21].\nOverlay coatings of classic design, with 18-22%Cr and 8-12%Al, generally perform better at\nhigher temperatures where oxidation is the dominant failure mode (above 900\u00b0C) reflecting\nthe good adherence of the thin alumina scales which is promoted by the presence of active\nelements such as Yttrium. Generally under these high temperature oxidising conditions\nNiCrAlY\u2019s and NiCoCrAlY\u2019s out perform the cobalt based systems.\nHowever, at low temperatures where type II hot corrosion predominates, 650-800\uf0b0C,\ncorrosion rates for the NiCrAlY and NiCoCrAlY overlay coatings can be relatively high.\n5CoCrAlY\u2019s generally out perform NiCrAlY based systems, with the high chromium\ncontaining CoCrAlY\u2019s showing best performance [8, 16, 19-22]\nThis is illustrated schematically in Figure 1 reproduced from a paper by Novak (1994) [22]\nand is similar to an early diagram by Mom in 1981 [21].\nMethods have been investigated to improve the traditional MCrAlY coatings by use of a\nplatinum underlayer and overlayers [23] . Other additions such as Ti, Zr, Hf, Si and Ta have\nbeen examined [24, 25, 26]. Surface modification by CVD, PVD or slurry cementation\ntechniques [27,28]have also been considered with varying degrees of success.\nSurface modification results in the formation of a duplex coating structure and this can\nresult in improved performance, for example, a pulse aluminised CoNiCrAlY coating\nexhibits superior corrosion resistance at 750 and 850\u00b0C compared to its plasma sprayed\ncounterpart [15]. Similarly the GT29, patented overlay coating [29] is formed by a gas\nphase diffusion treatment of a plasma sprayed MCrAlY coating. Silicon modifications to\nthe surface of CoCrAlY coatings [30] have also been proposed and improve the resistance to\nlow temperature hot corrosion.\nThe smart overlay coating concept, introduced within this paper, looks to extend these\nsurface modification concepts by grading not only the aluminium profile, but also the\nchromium, to further improve oxidation\/corrosion resistance.\n6The \u201cSmart Coating\u201d Concept\nIn order that a single coating can operate successfully over a range of temperatures with\ndifferent forms of corrosion attack \u2013 high temperature oxidation, type I and type II hot\ncorrosion \u2013 it needs to respond to local temperature in such a way that it will form either an\nalumina or chromia protective layer as appropriate. High purity alumina scales offer the\nbest protection under high temperature oxidation conditions, and this has been a major drive\nbehind the development of platinum aluminide coating technology. Chromia scales form\nmore readily at low to intermediate temperatures, are more resistant to salt fluxing and thus\nprovide a rapid repair route under hot corrosion conditions.\nIn a \u201cSmart overlay coating\u201d these joint requirements are achieved through the use of a\nchemically-graded coating structure enriched in aluminium and chromium as illustrated in\nFigure 2. Here the basic coating is a standard MCrAlY (in this study either\nCo32Ni21Cr8Al0.5Y or Ni25Cr6Al0.4Y) that has been enriched at its outer surface in\naluminium, sufficient to form \uf062-NiAl. Before this aluminising treatment, the MCrAlY is\npretreated to form an intermediate layer rich in chromium (this pretreatment process is\nproprietary and determines the structure and performance of the smart coating) [31,32].\nUnder high temperature oxidation, and type I hot corrosion conditions, above 800\uf0b0C, the\nouter layer of the coating reacts to form an alumina oxide layer, providing appropriate\nprotection under these oxidation\/corrosion conditions. The chromium rich intermediate\nlayer behaves as a diffusion barrier limiting the loss of aluminium by diffusion into the\nMCrAlY coating. It is also believed to limit the movement of base metal elemental\nadditions out to the \uf062-NiAl rich region.\n7At lower temperatures, 600-800\uf0b0C \u2013 in the type II corrosion regime \u2013 this outer layer of the\ncoating offers less protection. It is sacrificial and the rate of type II pitting corrosion is then\nlimited by the chromium rich interlayer which forms a more rapidly growing chromia\nprotective scale at these temperatures.\nThus the \u201cSmart\u201d coating functions by providing a more optimum response to corrosion\nattack that may be observed in industrial gas turbines at different aerofoil surface\ntemperatures. It should be appreciated that this optimised response results from the\nformation of the most suitable protective oxide scale in each temperature range of operation\nenvisaged. In this sense, the coating responds to its environment in a pseudo-intelligent\nmanner and has been given the generic name of SMARTCOAT.\nOptimisation of Corrosion Resistant Compositions\nA critical step in the design of SMARTCOAT was understanding the role MCrAl-based\nalloy composition played in the determination of the corrosion resistance of the overlay\ncoatings. Particularly the role of high chromium, high aluminium containing coating in\ncombating type II hot corrosion.\nEarly work on overlay coatings [33] considered a range of cobalt based materials with\nadditions of chromium between 20-40wt%, aluminium between 12-20wt% and yttrium at\nthe 0.5wt% level. From this study, the most successful coating following burner rig trials\n(1093\uf0b0C for 1100h), tensile and stress rupture tests was Co25Cr14Al0.5Y and this formed\nthe basis from which the majority of the MCrAlY oxidation\/corrosion resistant coatings\nhave been developed. Since this pioneering study, much research has been undertaken into\nthe MCrAlY series of alloys. New compositions have been identified for marine service\n8[20,34,35], for utility turbine conditions [36,37] and for high temperature cyclic oxidation\n[38,39]. Thus, since 1970, the base alloy composition has changed to include NiCrAlY\u2019s,\nCoNiCrAlY\u2019s and NiCoCrAlY\u2019s and various oxygen active elements have been added,\nincluding Hf, Zr, Si and Ta. However, the base compositions of most of these overlay\ncoatings still contain 5-14wt%Al and 18-30wt%Cr; compositions originally optimised for a\nhigh temperature oxidation protection, as evident from Talboom et al\u2019s original test\ncondition 1093\uf0b0C for 1100h.\nUnder type II hot corrosion conditions, work by Luthra and co-workers [20,40] showed the\nbenefit of high chromium containing alloys, with chromium contents up to 40wt%, while\nstudies at Cranfield have demonstrated the benefits of high chromium and high aluminium\nlevels, with an alloy containing 33wt%Cr and 33wt%Al exhibiting optimum corrosion\nperformance at 750\uf0b0C [41-43]. Figure 3 illustrates a ternary diagram at 750\uf0b0C, overlayed\nwith iso-corrosion contours [43] which demonstrates that the most corrosion resistant alloys\nat this temperature contain chromium levels between24-40wt% and aluminium levels\nbetween 27-37wt%, much higher than the levels in conventional MCrAlY coatings. It\nshould be further noted from Figure 3 that optimum corrosion performance under type II hot\ncorrosion is associated with a Cr\/Al ratio close to 1.0 (for a wide range of base alloy\ncontents. The optimum composition is Ni 33%Cr 33%Al in wt.%.\nStudies of these optimised corrosion resistant alloys was possible through the use of vapour\nphase alloy design [41,42]. This multi-target sputtering approach allows many alloy\ncompositions to be deposited in a single deposition run and thus corrosion contour maps can\nbe generated easily once the laboratory simulation environment has been selected. The\nmethodology is detailed in reference 42. Using this approach, ternary maps with iso-\n9corrosion contours were produced at 650, 700, 750, 800 and 950\uf0b0C. These studies confirm\nthe premise that high chromium containing alloys offer superior type II corrosion resistance,\nand further demonstrate that as the temperature is increased the overlay coating should\ncontain increased levels of aluminium, and reduced chromium contents, with the\ncompositions originally proposed by Talboom et. al. near optimum under high temperature\noxidation, when based on an MCrAl-X alloy design.\nThus from the iso-corrosion maps, the best corrosion performance at each of the test\ntemperatures was obtained with alloy compositions in the following ranges:-\n650\uf0b0C: alloys rich in chromium, with Cr > 40wt% and Al levels between 5-10wt%.\n700\uf0b0C: alloys rich in chromium, with Cr > 40wt%, but containing 20-40wt%\naluminium.\n750 and 800\uf0b0C: alloys contain 24-40wt%Cr and 27-37wt% Al: the optimum being\n33wt%Cr, 33wt%Al\n950\uf0b0C: alloys with 16-24wt%Cr and 13-18wt% Al\n1093\uf0b0C+: alloys centred on 25wt%Cr and 14wt%Al\nConventional commercial MCrAlY coatings have compositions containing: 18-30wt%Cr,\nplus 5-14wt%Al and so are a compromise between optimal protection for Type I corrosion\nand high temperature oxidation.\n__________________________________________________________________________\n+ Footnote data from Talboom et al (reference 33)\n10\nCoating Manufacture\nThese chemically graded coating structures were produced in this study through a\ncombination of spraying technologies and chemical vapour deposition. However, any\nmethod of depositing an MCrAlY coating can be used, including PVD technologies, electro-\nplating as well as plasma spray and flame spray technologies. The added benefit is not\nsoley in the base alloy composition, but in how it is treated to produce the graded\nmicrostructure.\nBoth argon shrouded, plasma spraying and high velocity oxy-fuel spraying (HVOF) have\nbeen used successfully to deposit the MCrAlY base. CoNiCrAlY (Amdry 995) and a\nNiCrAlY (Amdry 963) have been used as base coating systems.\nThe second step is to surface treat the as-sprayed MCrAlY to form the chromium rich\ninterlayer. This step is proprietary, but is designed to produce a continuous inner zone\ncontaining some 60wt%Cr.\nThe final step is an aluminising treatment, to develop the outer \uf062-NiAl oxidation resistant\nlayer. Thus without the proprietary intermediate layer treatment the production route is\nsimilar to the General Electric proprietary coating GT29+. Both high activity and low\nactivity aluminising process have been used to produce SMART coatings, using both pack\ncementation and gas phase CVD processes. These process differences are reflected in the\nSMARTCOAT series, with coatings coded SmC105 through SmC155 (see later corrosion\nstudies).\n11\nThe combination of spray deposition (HVOF or plasma spraying), the surface pretreatment,\nthen diffusion aluminising results in a layered microstructure, an example of which is\nillustrated in Figure 4. This coating (SmC155) clearly shows the three zones developed\nwithin a SMARTCOAT: the outer aluminide diffusion zone (A), the chromium rich,\ndisplaced intermediate zone (B) and the remaining HVOF\/plasma spray coating (C) \u2013 a\nplasma sprayed coating for the example presented in Figure 4. The analyses at points A-C\nare summarised in Table 1.\nIt is the chromium rich interlayer (B) that distinguishes SMARTCOAT structures, from the\nmore traditional graded structures produced by over-aluminising a MCrAlY overlay coating,\nfor example GT29+. This interlayer is optimum for type II corrosion resistance when its\ncomposition lies in the range 38-60 wt%Cr, 20-36wt%Al balance nickel. One general\nobservation is that NiCrAlY based systems perform better than those based on CoNiCrAlY\nalloys, as there is a lower risk of sigma phase formation with the NiCrAlY based graded\ncoating microstructure.\nHot Corrosion Resistance of SMARTCOAT Structures\nThe hot corrosion performance of SMARTCOAT variants were evaluated using a salt recoat\ntest procedure [44], in controlled gaseous environments with daily replenishment of\ncorrosion deposits. Both the NiCrAlY and CoNiCrAlY based coatings were evaluated.\nFor each family of coatings hot corrosion tests were performed at 700 and 800\uf0b0C. The test\nduration was 500h in an air-400 vpm SO2\/SO3 gaseous environment. The salt used was a\neutectic mixture, 80% Na2SO4\/20%K2SO4, replenished every 20h at a rate of 0.3mg\/cm2 (an\naverage deposition flux of 0.015mg\/cm2\/h). Six variants of the SMARTCOAT were\n12\nevaluated in each test together with two standard, industrial gas turbine coatings \u2013 a\nplatinum aluminide (RT22) and a triple layered silicon aluminide (Sermetel 1515).\nCorrosion loss was evaluated using dimensional metrology as discussed in reference 44,\nwith the metal loss analysed statistically (see reference 45) to estimate the maximum\ncorrosion rates.\nThe commercial coatings exhibited class type II hot corrosion at 700\uf0b0C and type I hot\ncorrosion at 800\uf0b0C, as can be seen in Figure 5. After 500h exposure at 700\uf0b0C, the RT22\ncoating was penetrated through to the interdiffusion zone, while at 800\uf0b0C it had been\ncompletely consumed and the substrate (IN738LC) was also severely attacked.\nBy comparison, all SMARTCOAT variants show little attack as can be seen for variant\nSmC155H in Figure 5. SmC155H was one of the worst attacked of these SMARTCOAT\nvariants, particularly at 800\uf0b0C. Table II summarises the measured corrosion rates for a\nnumber of smart coatings compared to the industrial standards RT22 (a platinum aluminide)\nand Sermetel 1515 (a triple layered silicon aluminide treatment). The smart coating\nmatches the performance of the best type I hot corrosion resistant (RT22) and type II hot\ncorrosion resistant (Sermetel 1515) diffusion coatings. Thus a single coating treatment\nprovides both type I and type II hot corrosion protection.\nA further point to note is that the SMARTCOAT structure also modifies the mode of attack\nat both 700 and 800\uf0b0C. No longer are deep pits observed \u2013 see Figure 5 \u2013 instead the\ncorrosion attack only penetrates the outer diffusion aluminide treated zone, stopping at the\nchromium rich corrosion barrier. Once this barrier zone is reached the outer aluminide\n13\nlayer is progressively consumed, providing cathodic protection in these molten salt deposits\nthat form under hot corrosion conditions.\nThis benefit cannot be attributed solely to the over aluminising treatment, as the over-\naluminised MCrAlY coatings were also severely attacked in this aggressive laboratory test.\nIt is the combination of over aluminising and the chromium rich, corrosion barrier layer\n(characteristic of SMARTCOAT) that provides this additional protection. The best of the\nsmart coating variants lost between 25-30\uf06dm at maximum, at 700\uf0b0C \u2013 SmC155- , and at\nmaximum 15-35\uf06dm at 800\uf0b0C \u2013 SmC153.\nFuture Developments in Smart Coating Technology\nAs with all high temperature, environmental protection systems selective oxidation\nnecessarily depletes the coating of beneficial scale forming elements (Al, Cr or Si) as the\nprotective oxide is formed and grows. Hot corrosion reactions exacerbate this problem,\nsuch that ultimately the coating loses the ability to reform the protective oxide if damaged as\na result of corrosion, or oxide spallation during shut down or cyclic operation. As a\nconsequence the economic benefits associated with long term, or high temperature,\noperation are at risk. The way forward is to improve the coatings repair capability by\nincorporating both reservoir phases and scavenger phases within the smart coating system.\nBoth will provide a self healing capability and thus extend coating life.\nA reservoir phase is an intermetallic compound that can source scale forming elements as\nthe levels of these elements are depleted in the coating. Possible systems under\ninvestigation include Al2Y and NiAl3. The former can source both aluminium and yttrium,\nconfering extended protection under high temperature oxidation conditions. The latter\n14\nsources aluminium, but more importantly remains molten for an extended time during\nthermal spraying processes and therefore permits closure of open inter-particle boundaries\n[46], a source of rapid coating degradation due to increased oxidation within the near\nsurface region of the coating. A companion paper discusses the enhanced degradation due\nto the formation of isolated small diffusion cells [47].\nFigure 6 illustrates the incorporation of Al2Y as a reservoir phase within the microstructure\nof a HIP processed SMARTCOAT structure. The optimum position of the reservoir phase\ndepends on diffusion rates to provide a sufficient flux to ensure that the near surface\nelemental composition (Al and Y in this example) is sufficient to repair and maintain the\nprotective oxide.\nA scavenger phase works differently. Now the phase is added to react, and entrap, tramp\nelements that may move from the alloy substrate through the coating to the metal oxide\ninterface, so compromising the stability of the protective oxide scale. The presence of\nminute quantities of sulphur have long been recognised as detrimental [48-50]\ncompromising the adhesion of the protective, thermally grown oxide. Other elements may\nwork in a similar manner including phosphorus and possibly carbon.\nSimilarly, diffusion of deliberate alloy additions from the substrate into the coating may also\nbe detrimental to coating performance. Molybdenum and tungsten have long been\nrecognised for their influence on the acidic fluxing of oxide scales under hot corrosion\nconditions, while too high a level of titanium, in the near surface region, leads to the\nformation, of rutile within or under the alumina scales compromising alumina scale\nadhesion.\n15\nTo overcome such problems, scavenger phases can be added to the coating. Figure 7\nillustrates the incorporation of Cr3C2 into a graded overlay coating structure. The Cr3C2\nparticles are present as a network of carbides around prior splat boundaries and are\npositioned within the coating, just above the coating substrate interface. A scavenger phase\nmust have transitional stability, that is within the as-deposited coating it is stable but if\nsurrounded by sufficient elements that can form more stable compounds it will breakdown,\nsourcing a scavenger element. For the above example Cr3C2 acts as a source of carbon to\ntie up outward diffusing titanium. Equally in the foregoing discussion, Al2Y was considered\nas a reservoir phase but it could equally scavenge sulphur through interacting with the\nyttrium. Chromium carbide is another scavenger phase, relative to titanium, molybdenum\nand tungsten, it is partially stable reacting to form TiC, for example, and releasing\nchromium. Chromium carbide has been demonstrated by the authors to be a very effective\nscavenger phase for tramp element, titanium diffusion [51], limiting the transport of\ntitanium through to the metal oxide interface and therefore prolonging the life of a smart\ncoating system. Figure 8 illustrates this behaviour. Note, the high titanium peaks near the\nsmart coating\/substrate interface trapping titanium as carbides as moves outward from the\nsubstrate due to diffusion.\nConclusions\n1) A new type of chemically graded coating has been designed, from a knowledge of\nthe corrosion mechanisms operating under high temperature oxidation, type I and\ntype II hot corrosion.\n2) The coating is graded in aluminium and chromium content, with an outer \uf062-NiAl\naluminium rich composition to confer high temperature oxidation resistance and\n16\ntype I hot corrosion protection and an interlayer, rich in chromium, to confer type II\ncorrosion protection.\n3) The coating confers protection over an extended range of service temperatures and\ncorrosion environments likely to be experienced in an industrial gas turbine. It does\nthis in a pseudo-intelligent manner by responding to the temperature and\nenvironment, to form the optimum protective oxide scale: alumina at high\ntemperatures and chromia under type II corrosion conditions.\n4) Results of laboratory corrosion tests are extremely promising, with the best of the\nSMARTCOAT variants, matching or outperforming RT22, a platinum aluminide\ncoating, and Sermetel 1515, a multilayered silicon-aluminide, at 700 and 800\uf0b0C.\nUnlike both of these commercially available coatings, SMART coatings can be\ndeposited substantially thicker and so would offer a significant improvement in\ncoating service life.\n5) The concepts of reservoir and scavenger phases, as part of a smart coating system\nhave been demonstrated. The selective inclusion of such phases within a high\ntemperature coating system can further extend coating life by limiting oxide scale\nfailure, either through sourcing beneficial elemental additions (reservoir behaviour)\nor trapping detrimental elements (scavenger behaviour).\n17\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors wish to thank all colleagues involved in the smart overlay coating project for\ntheir input, particularly the close collaboration with various industrial partners during the\ndevelopment of the SMARTCOAT concept.
