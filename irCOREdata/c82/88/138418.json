This paper explores ways in which hybrid strategies can be\ndeveloped to create cost-effective supply chains and proposes an integrated\nmanufacture\/logistics model for enabling the essential infrastructure.\nIntroduction\nA key feature of present day business is the idea that it is supply chains that compete,\nnot companies (Christopher, 1992), and the success or failure of supply chains is\nultimately determined in the marketplace by the end consumer. Getting the right\nproduct, at the right price, at the right time to the consumer is not only the lynch pin to\ncompetitive success but also the key to survival. Hence, customer satisfaction and\nmarketplace understanding are crucial elements for consideration when attempting to\nestablish a new supply chain strategy. Only when the requirements and constraints of\nthe marketplace are understood can an enterprise attempt to develop a strategy that will\nmeet the needs of both the supply chain and the end customer.\nSupply chain performance improvement initiatives strive to match supply to demand\nthereby driving down costs simultaneously with improving customer satisfaction. This\ninvariably requires uncertainty within the supply chain to be reduced as much as\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, Vol. 31, No. 4, pp235-246, 2001 2\npracticable so as to facilitate a more predictable upstream demand (Mason-Jones et al.,\n1999). Sometimes however, uncertainty is impossible to remove from the supply\nchain due to the type of product involved. For example, if a product is highly\nfashionable then by its intrinsic nature its demand will be unpredictable. Hence,\nspecific supply chains are faced with the situation where they have to accept\nuncertainty but need to develop a strategy that enables them to still match supply and\ndemand.\nSignificant interest has been shown in recent years in the idea of \u2018lean manufacturing\u2019\n(Womack, Jones & Roos, 1990), and the wider concepts of the \u2018lean enterprise\u2019\n(Womack, & Jones, 1996). The focus of the lean approach has essentially been on the\nelimination of waste or muda. The upsurge of interest in lean manufacturing can be\ntraced to the Toyota Production Systems (TPS) with its focus on the reduction and\nelimination of waste (Ohno, 1988). However, the origins of lean manufacture are\ncertainly visible in Spitfire aircraft production in the UK in World War II, and\nKeiretsu dates back to the US automotive industry in 1915 (Towill, et al., 2000). In\nthe context of the present paper, it has been argued elsewhere (Christopher, 2000) that\nlean concepts work well where demand is relatively stable and hence predictable and\nwhere variety is low. Conversely, in those contexts where demand is volatile and the\ncustomer requirement for variety is high, a much higher level of agility is required.\nAgility is a business-wide capability that embraces organisational structures,\ninformation systems, logistics processes and in particular, mindsets. A key\ncharacteristic of an agile organisation is flexibility. In that respect, the origins of\nagility as a business concept lie partially in flexible manufacturing systems (FMS).\nInitially it was thought that the route to manufacturing flexibility was through\nautomation to enable rapid changeovers (i.e. reduced set-up times) and thus enable a\ngreater responsiveness to changes in product mix or volume. Later this idea of\nmanufacturing flexibility was extended into the wider business context (Nagel and\nDove, 1991) and the concept of agility as an organisational orientation was born.\nNaylor et al. (1999) provide a useful definition of the two paradigms we are\nconsidering as follows:\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, Vol. 31, No. 4, pp235-246, 2001 3\n\u201cAgility means using market knowledge and a virtual corporation to exploit\nprofitable opportunities in a volatile marketplace.\u201d\n\u201cLeanness means developing a value stream to eliminate all waste including\ntime, and to enable a level schedule.\u201d\nIt is the purpose of the present paper to show the various ways in which these\nparadigms may be combined to enable highly competitive supply chains capable of\nwinning in a volatile and cost-conscious environment. In doing so we shall emphasise\nthe important differences between the two paradigms, and also how one may benefit\nfrom the implementation of the other. As Warnecke and Huser (1995) forcefully point\nout, there is a need in all change management programmes to consider the intellectual\nas well as the operational needs of the supply chain. Hence, the development and\ndescription of our Integrated Model for enabling the agile enterprise based upon the\nconcept of a seamless connection between manufacture and logistics.\nThe Cyclical Nature of Market Winners and Market Qualifiers\nHill (1993) has earlier developed the concept of \u2018order qualifiers\u2019 and \u2018order winners\u2019\nagainst which it is advocated that manufacturing strategy should be determined. As\nthese labels suggest, it is important for every business to understand what the baseline\nis for entering into a competitive arena \u2013 these are the \u2018order qualifiers\u2019. To actually\nwin the order requires specific capabilities and these Hill termed the \u2018order winners\u2019.\nThe definition of order qualifiers and order winners then logically leads to the\nspecification of the appropriate manufacturing strategy. We can borrow from these\nimportant ideas to develop a wider supply chain oriented concept of \u2018market qualifiers\u2019\nand \u2018market winners\u2019. The notion here is that to be truly competitive requires not just\nthe appropriate manufacturing strategy, but rather an appropriate holistic supply chain\nstrategy.\nThe connection between these ideas of \u2018qualifiers\u2019 and \u2018winners\u2019 and \u2018lean\u2019 and \u2018agile\u2019\nis critical. At its simplest the lean paradigm is most powerful when the winning\ncriteria is cost; however, when service and customer value enhancement are prime\nrequirements for market winning then the likelihood is that agility will become the\ncritical dimension. Figure 1 illustrates the crucial differences in focus between the\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, Vol. 31, No. 4, pp235-246, 2001 4\nlean and agile paradigm depending upon the market qualifiers and the market winners\nbased upon the work of Mason-Jones et. al. (2000).\nAgile\nSupply\nLean\nSupply\nMarket Market\nQualifiers Winners\nFig 1\nMarket Winners - Market Qualifiers Matrix for Agile Versus Lean Supply\n[Source: Mason-Jones, Naylor, and Towill (2000)]\nIt is in the nature of competition that last year\u2019s market winner will be replaced this\nyear by a former market qualifier (Johannson et. al., 1993). This can be illustrated in\nthe context of the lean and agile paradigms by studying the migration of the operation\nof the Personal Computer supply chain. Thus Table I describes the transition over a\n15-20 year period from product driven to market orientated to market driven and\nfinally through to individual customer driven enterprise (Christopher and Towill,\n2000). During that change the market winner has rotated between quality, cost,\navailability and lead-time. But at any one point in time the other performance metrics\nremain market qualifiers which cannot be prejudiced if business is to continue to be\nwon.\nAttributes of Lean and Agile Supply\nWhereas quality, service level, and lead-time are market qualifiers for lean supply,\nwith the market winner then being cost, the latter benchmark is merely an important\nqualifier in agile supply (Christopher and Towill, 2000). Fisher (1997) makes a\nsimilar point which is that where the risk of obsolescence and\/or the cost of a stock-out\nis high relative to the cost of production and distribution, then a different supply chain\nsolution is required. This leads to the conclusion that the total costs for the Product\nDelivery Process (PDP) are :-\n1. Quality\n2. Cost\n3. Lead Time\n1. Service Level\n1. Quality\n2. Lead Time\n3. Service Level\n1. Cost\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, Vol. 31, No. 4, pp235-246, 2001 5\nSupply Chain Total PDP Costs = Physical PDP Costs + Marketability Costs\nWhere\n\uf0b7 Physical Costs includes all production, distribution, and storage costs.\n\uf0b7 Marketability Costs includes all obsolescence and stockout costs.\nSUPPLY CHAIN\nEVOLUTION\nPHASE\nI II III IV\nSUPPLY CHAIN\nTIME\nMARKER\nearly 1980s late 1980s early 1990s late 1990s\nSUPPLY CHAIN\nPHILOSOPHY\nProduct\nDriven\nMarket\nOrientated\nMarket\nDriven\nCustomer\nDriven\nSC\nTYPE\nLean\nFunctional\nSilos\nLean\nSupply\nChain\nLeagile\nSupply\nChain\nCustomised\nLeagile\nSupply Chain\nMARKET\nWINNER\nQuality Cost Availability Lead Time\nMARKET\nQUALIFIERS\n(a) Cost\n(b) Availability\n(c) Lead Time\n(a) Availability\n(b) Lead Time\n(c) Quality\n(a) Lead Time\n(b) Quality\n(c) Cost\n(a) Quality\n(b) Cost\n(c) Availability\nPERFORMANCE\nMETRICS\n(a) Stock Turns\n(b) Production\nCost\n(a) Throughput\nTime\n(b) Physical\nCost\n(a) Market Share\n(b) Total Cost\n(a) Customer\nSatisfaction\n(b) Value Added\nTable I\nSummary of the Transition in the Personal Computer supply Chain from Product\nDriven to Customer Driven Operations\n[Christopher and Towill, 2000]\nThe first cost source (PDP) dominates lean supply whereas the second cost source\n(marketability costs) dominates agile supply. Note that lost sales are gone forever in\nthe agile supply chain whether the cause is due to stockouts or to obsolescence. This is\nbecause it is an extremely harsh and competitive marketplace with little brand loyalty.\nAs we shall see later, the requirement is for the product to be both affordable and\navailable. We shall now undertake a detailed comparison of lean and agile supply by\ncomparing specific attributes which highlight the specific problems to be overcome in\nenabling the appropriate business strategy to be adopted.\nBoth agility and leanness demand high levels of product quality. They also require\nminimisation of total lead-times defined as the time taken from a customer raising a\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, Vol. 31, No. 4, pp235-246, 2001 6\nrequest for a product or service until it is delivered. Total lead-time has to be\nminimised to enable agility, as demand is highly volatile and thus difficult to forecast.\nIf a supply chain has long end-to-end lead-time then it will not be able to respond\nquickly enough to exploit marketplace demand. Furthermore effective engineering of\ncycle time reduction always leads to significant bottom line improvements in\nmanufacturing costs and productivity Towill (1996).\nLead-time needs to be reduced in lean manufacturing as by definition excess time is\nwaste and leanness calls for the elimination of all waste. The essence of the difference\nbetween leanness and agility in terms of the total value provided to the customer is that\nservice level (availability) is the critical factor calling for agility whilst cost, and hence\nthe sales price, is clearly linked to leanness. However, whereas the Total Cycle Time\nCompression Paradigm (Towill, 1996), when effectively implemented, is a sufficient\ncondition for achieving lean production, it is only one necessary condition for enabling\nagile supply.\nDISTINGUISHING\nATTRIBUTES\nLEAN SUPPLY AGILE SUPPLY\nTypical Products Commodities Fashion Goods\nMarketplace Demand Predictable Volatile\nProduct Variety Low High\nProduct Life Cycle Long Short\nCustomer Drivers Cost Availability\nProfit Margin Low High\nDominant Costs Physical Costs Marketability Costs\nStockout Penalties Long Term Contractual Immediate and Volatile\nPurchasing Policy Buy Materials Assign Capacity\nInformation Enrichment Highly Desirable Obligatory\nForecasting Mechanism Algorithmic Consultative\nTable II\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, Vol. 31, No. 4, pp235-246, 2001 7\nComparison of Lean Supply with Agile Supply : The Distinguishing Attributes\n[Source: Mason-Jones, Naylor and Towill (2000)]\nTable II illustrates the comparison of attributes between lean and agile supply. In the\nvolatile unpredictable marketplace for \u201cfashion\u201d goods, both stockout and\nobsolescence costs are punitive. Consequently the purchasing policy moves from\nplacing orders upstream for products moving in a regular flow to that of assigning\ncapacity to finalise products in rapid response mode. As Fisher et al (1994) have\nindicated this means forecasting via \u201cintelligent\u201d consultation so as to maximise inputs\nfrom \u201crich\u201d marketplace insider sources.\nPractical Ways of Marrying the Lean and Agile Paradigms\nAs we have indicated, there are a number of common elements between the lean and\nagile paradigms. Provided the whole concept is fully thought through and properly\nmanaged, lean and agile businesses can co-exist, even when on the same site and with\nsome limited rotation of personnel (Aitken, 2001). Here are three proven ways in\nwhich the paradigms have been brought together to provide available and affordable\nproducts for the end customer.\nThe Pareto Curve Approach\nMany companies manufacturing or distributing a range of products will find that the\nPareto Law will apply and can be exploited to determine supply strategy. Typically an\nanalysis of the business will show that the 80\/20 (or similar) rule holds (Koch, 1997).\nIn other words, 80% of total volume will be generated from just 20% of the total\nproduct line. The way in which these 20% are managed should probably be quite\ndifferent from the way the remaining 80% are managed. For example it could be\nargued that the top 20% of products by volume are likely to be more predictable and\nhence they lend themselves to lean principles of manufacturing and distribution. The\nslow moving 80% on the other hand will typically be less predictable and will require\na more agile mode of management. Figure 2 suggests one generic way in which\nsupply chain strategies may be devised for the predictable 20% and the more volatile\n80% of products.\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, Vol. 31, No. 4, pp235-246, 2001 8\nFigure 2 \u2013 The pareto distribution\nThe De-coupling Point Approach\nA further marrying of the lean and agile paradigms can be achieved through the\ncreation of a \u2018de-coupling point\u2019 using what may be termed strategic inventory. Here\nthe idea is to hold inventory in some generic or modular form and only complete the\nfinal assembly or configuration when the precise customer requirement is known. An\nexample is the customised PC (Christopher and Towill, 2000). This concept of\n\u2018postponement\u2019 is now increasingly widely employed by organisations in a range of\nindustries (van Hoek, 1998). As shown in Figure 3, by utilising the concept of\npostponement, companies may utilise lean methods up to the de-coupling point and\nagile methods beyond it. Companies such as Hewlett Packard have successfully\nemployed such strategies to enable products to be localised much closer in time to\nactual demand (Feitzinger and Lee, 1997). However, as Pagh and Cooper (1998) have\npointed out, satisfying customer demand may require particular combinations of\npostponed manufacture and postponed logistics\nA parallel concept to the \u2018material\u2019 de-coupling point described above is that of the\n\u2018information\u2019 de-coupling point (Mason Jones and Towill, 1999). This represents the\nfurthest point upstream to which information on \u2018real\u2019 demand flows i.e. information\nwhich has not been distorted by inventory policies such as re-order points and re-order\n80%\n20%\n% of\ntotal\ndemand\n% of products\nLean\n\u2022 Make to forecast\n\u2022 Low priority in\nproduction schedule\n\u2022 Manage inventory\ncentrally\n\u2022 Seek economies of\nscale\nAgile\n\u2022 Make to order\n\u2022 High priority in\nproduction schedule\n\u2022 Utilise quick response and\ncontinuous replenishment\nconcepts\n\u2022 Forecast for capacity,\nexecute to demand\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, Vol. 31, No. 4, pp235-246, 2001 9\nquantities. The ability to base replenishment decisions on real demand clearly\ncontributes to supply chain agility.\nFigure 3 \u2013 The decoupling point\nSeparation of \u201cBase\u201d and \u201cSurge\u201d Demands\nOther hybrid strategies that have been employed with success are based upon\nseparating demand patterns into \u2018base\u2019 and \u2018surge\u2019 elements (Gattorna and Walters,\n1996). Figure 4 highlights this distinction together with one possible level scheduling\nsolution where capacity demands are smoothed by intelligent switching of \u2018base\u2019\nproduction. Base demand can be forecast on the basis of past history whereby surge\ndemand typically cannot. Base demand can be met through classic lean procedures to\nachieve economies of scale whereas surge demand is provided for through more\nflexible, and probably higher cost, processes. Strategies such as these are increasingly\nbeing employed in the fashion industry where the base demand can be sourced in low\ncost countries and the surge demand \u2018topped up\u2019 locally nearer to the market. Even\nthough the unit cost of manufacture in local markets will be higher than sourcing in\nlow cost locations, the supply chain advantage can be considerable. Alternatively,\narrangements can be made for dealing with both \u201cbase\u201d and \u201csurge\u201d demands either by\nseparation in space (via separate production lines) or in time (by using slack periods to\nproduce base stock). This contrasts with the lean concept of \u2018level scheduling\u2019.\nLean Agile\n\u2022 Forecast at generic\nlevel\n\u2022 Economic batch\nquantities\n\u2022 Maximise efficiencies\n\u2022 Demand driven\n\u2022 Localised\nConfiguration\n\u2022 Maximise\neffectivenessStrategic\nInventory\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, Vol. 31, No. 4, pp235-246, 2001 10\nFigure 4 \u2013 Responding to Combinations of \u2018Base\u2019 and \u2018Surge\u2019 Demands\nWell documented companies employing such strategies include Zara (Christopher,\n1998), Benetton (Zuccaro, 1998), and National Bicycle (Fisher et. al, 1994). What is\nparticularly important is to relate the strategy throughout the whole supply chain to the\nneeds of the end customer in terms of both affordability and availability.\nWhilst these three strategies are complementary rather than mutually exclusive, it is\nlikely that each may work better in certain conditions. A suggested set of appropriate\nconditions for the application of the three hybrid strategies is presented in Table III\nbelow :-\nD\ne\nm\na\nn\nd\nP\nC\na\np\na\nc\ni\nt\ny\nU\ns\na\ng\ne TimeTime\nSmooth\nscheduling of\n(a) Total (b) Level Scheduling\nSolution\n\u201cSurge\u201d\n\u201cBase\u201d\nFor\n\u201cBase\u201d\nProdu\nFor \u201cSurge\u201d\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, Vol. 31, No. 4, pp235-246, 2001 11\nHybrid strategies\nAppropriate market conditions and\noperating environment\nPareto\/80:20 Using lean methods for the\nvolume lines, agile methods for the slow\nmovers.\nHigh levels of variety; demand is non-\nproportionate across the range.\nDe-coupling point The aim is to be lean\nup to the de-coupling point and agile\nbeyond it.\nPossibility of modular production or\nintermediate inventory; delayed final\nconfiguration or distribution.\nSurge\/base demand separation\nManaging the forecastable element of\ndemand using lean principles; using agile\nprinciples for the less predictable element.\nWhere base level of demand can\nconfidently be predicted from past\nexperience and where local\nmanufacturing, small batch capacity is\navailable.\nTable III\nA Contingency Approach to Supply Chain Strategy Choice\nThe three lean\/agile hybrid strategies described above confirm that the real focus of\nsupply chain re-engineering should be on seeking ways in which the appropriate\ncombination of lean and agile strategies can be achieved. Our proposed Integrated\nModel described below provides the essential infrastructure.\nAn Integrated Approach to Supply Chain Design.\nOur contention is that lean methodologies can be a powerful contributor to the\ncreation of agile enterprises. In particular where product ranges can be separated\naccording to volume and variability and\/or where the de-coupling concept can be\napplied, a real opportunity exists for employing hybrid lean\/agile strategies. There is\nalso one important sense in which lean precedes agile, and which has been advanced\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, Vol. 31, No. 4, pp235-246, 2001 12\nby Victor and Boynton (1998) in the context of moving towards mass customisation.\nThis is because real and effective change requires the mapping and understanding of\nall the relevant business processes. Thus, in an industrial engineering scenario the lean\nknowledge base is there to be exploited in enabling further performance improvements\nincluding building in agility (Childerhouse et al, 2000).\nFigure 5 : An Integrated Model for Enabling the Agile Supply Chain\nFigure 5 suggests a three level framework summarising our view of the agile supply\nchain. The concept of such a framework was first advocated by Werr et al. (1997). We\nhave found it extremely useful in bringing together the various strands which\ncontribute to the agile enterprise. In this integrative model, Level 1 represents the key\nprinciples that underpin the agile supply chain; rapid replenishment; and postponed\nfulfilment. Level 2 identifies the individual programmes such as lean production,\norganisational agility, and quick response which must be implemented in order for the\nLevel 1 principles to be achieved. Level 3 specifies individual actions to be taken to\nsupport Level 2 programmes, for example, time compression, information\nenrichment, and waste elimination. Not all the characteristics shown in Figure 5 may\nbe necessary in any one specific market\/manufacturing context, but it is likely that the\nImpact of\nAgile\nManufacture\nImpact of\nAgile\nLogistics\nLevel 1\nPrinciples\nLevel 2\nProgrammes\nLevel 3\nActions\nPostponed\nfulfillment\nt\nl ill t\nAgile\nSupply Chain\nil\nl i\nRapid\nreplenishment\ni\nl i t\nOrganisational\nAgility\ni ti l\nilit\nFlexible\nResponse\nl i l\nLean\nProductionti\nEconomies\nof Scale\ni\nl\nStandardisation\/\nModularisation\nt i ti \/\nl i ti\nWaste\nReduction\nt\nti\nAgile\nSupply\nil\nl\nVendor\nManaged\nInventoryt\nSynchronised\noperations\ni\nti\nProcess\nManagementt\nCross\nFunctional\nTeams\nti l\nDemand\nDriveni\nVisibility of\nReal Demand\ni i ilit\nl\nContinuous\nReplenishment\nProgrammes\nti\nl i t\nSet-up\nTime Reduction\nt\ni ti\nQuick\nResponse\ni\nPipeline\nTime\nReduction\ni li\ni\nti\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, Vol. 31, No. 4, pp235-246, 2001 13\nagile supply chain will embody many of these elements. What is certain is that much\nof the conventional wisdom concerning manufacturing strategy, supplier relations and\ndistribution will have to be challenged if real agility is to be achieved from within the\nsupply chain.\nRapid replenishment, for example, requires agile suppliers, organisational agility, and\na demand driven supply chain (Lowson et.al. 1999). Similarly, postponed fulfilment\nenables the adoption of lean production principles up to the de-coupling point\nsupported by agile capabilities beyond that point (Harrison et. al.1999). Nor must the\ncultural side be forgotten, since it may be the single biggest barrier to effective\nchange. For example, in moving towards an agile structure in one company in the\npharmaceuticals sector, it was found that the anticipated IT problems did not arise.\nInstead, the real stumbling blocks were the difficulty of creating an understanding of\nthe new system, and the creation of a customer focused culture ~ in other words people\nproblems (Belk and Steels, 1998). Such reasons could also help explain why\nsuccessful industrial implementation of quick response programmes is more patchy\nthan expected, (Kohzab, 2000). This is just supporting evidence for the view\npreviously expressed by Andraski (1994) in commenting on the ineffectiveness of\nmany real-world supply chains. He suggested that this is because \u201880% of problems\nthat arise are due to people, not technology\u2019.\nCreating an agile supply clearly requires a number of significant changes to the status\nquo. Supply chain managers today need also to be change managers \u2013 not just\nmanaging change within the organisation, but managing change in the way that\nrelationships between organisations are structured. The trend towards the creation of\nthe \u2018virtual\u2019 organisation, whilst likely to help achieve agility (Preiss et.al., 1995), also\nrequires a high level of co-ordination and management. One way to achieve this co-\nordination is to make use of a \u2018pipeline integrator\u2019 or, as they have sometimes been\ntermed, a Fourth Party Logistics Service provider (4PL). These organisations make\nuse of their expertise and knowledge of managing global supply chains to ensure that\neven in complex networks a more agile response can be achieved. An example of one\ncompany that is taking up this role on behalf of global clients is the Hong Kong based\ncompany Li and Fung (Magretta, 1995). Li and Fung were originally a trading\ncompany sourcing and distributing products on behalf of their principals. Over the\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, Vol. 31, No. 4, pp235-246, 2001 14\nyears they have developed specific expertise and skills that enable them to manage and\nco-ordinate supply chains. For example, Li and Fung, on behalf of the US retailers,\nthe Limited, will order un-dyed yarn from the yarn supplier, book weaving and dying\ncapacity at fabric manufacturers\u2019 facilities and manufacturing capacity at the garment\nfactories; all in advance of the actual requirement being known. As the Limited gets a\nclearer view of what the requirement is for actual styles, colours and sizes then Li and\nFung will issue precise orders and manage the entire supply chain. In the words of the\nChairman, Victor Fung :-\n\u201cIt would be easier to let the factories worry about securing their own fabric\nand trim. But then the order would take three months, not five weeks. So to\nshrink the delivery cycle, I go upstream to organise production. And the\nshorter production time lets the retailer hold off before having to commit to\nfashion trend. It\u2019s all about flexibility, response time, small production runs,\nsmall minimum order quantities, and the ability to shift direction as the trends\nmove\u201d. (Magretta, 1995).\nConclusion\nIt is becoming increasingly apparent that competitive advantage derives from the\ncombined capabilities of the network of linked organisations that today we call \u2018the\nsupply chain\u2019. This is a fundamental shift in the traditionally held view of a business\nmodel based upon a single firm. It has also become apparent that markets today are\nincreasingly volatile and hence less predictable and so the need for a more agile\nresponse has grown.\nPutting these two ideas together leads us to the conclusion that a pre-requisite for\nsuccess in these markets will be an agile supply chain.\nWhat we have proposed in this paper is a framework for agility that is contingent upon\nthe context in which the business operates. Thus we have sought to bring together the\nlean and agile philosophies to highlight the differences in their approach but also to\nshow how they might be combined for greater effect. Increasingly, managers need to\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, Vol. 31, No. 4, pp235-246, 2001 15\nunderstand how market conditions and the wider operating environment will demand\nnot a single off-the-shelf solution, but hybrid strategies which are context specific.\nReferences\nAitken, J., (2000) \u201cAgility and Leanness \u2013 A Successful and Complimentary\nPartnership in the Lighting Industry\u201d, Proc.
