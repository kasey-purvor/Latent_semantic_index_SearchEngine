For virtual \u03b1 decays of\nbound mirror pairs this symmetry manifests itself as a relation between the asymptotic normalization coefficients\n(ANCs) of \u03b1-particle overlap integrals. This relation is given by a simple analytical formula that involves\n\u03b1-particle separation energies and charges of residual nuclei. For bound-unbound mirror pairs, the ANC of a\nbound nucleus is related to the \u03b1 width of the mirror unbound level. For unbound mirror pairs we get a new\nanalytical formula that relates the widths of mirror resonances. We test the validity of these analytical formulas\nagainst the predictions of a two-body potential and of a many-body microscopic cluster model for several mirror\nstates in 7Li-7Be, 11B-11C, and 19F-19Ne isotopes. We show that these analytical formulas are valid in many\ncases but that some deviations can be expected for isotopes with strongly deformed and easily excited cores.\nIn general, the results from microscopic model are not very sensitive to model assumptions and can be used to\npredict unknown astrophysically relevant cross sections using known information about mirror systems.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevC.75.034302 PACS number(s): 21.10.Jx, 21.60.Gx, 23.60.+e, 27.20.+n\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn the past few years, it has been acknowledged that\ncharge symmetry of nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction leads to\nspecific relations between the amplitudes of mirror-conjugated\none-nucleon decays ANZ \u2192 A\u22121N\u22121Z + n and AZN \u2192 A\u22121Z\u22121N + p\n[1]. In a mirror pair of bound states this symmetry links asymp-\ntotic normalization coefficients (ANCs) for mirror-conjugated\noverlap integrals \u3008ANZ|A\u22121N\u22121Z \u2297 n\u3009 and \u3008AZN |A\u22121Z\u22121N \u2297 p\u3009. In\nbound-unbound mirror states, it manifests itself as a link\nbetween the neutron ANC and the width of the mirror proton\nresonance. In both cases this link can be represented by\nan approximate simple model-independent analytical formula\nthat contains only nucleon binding energies, nuclear charges\nand the range of the strong nucleon-core interaction [1].\nComparison with microscopic cluster model calculations [2,3]\nhas shown that the average accuracy of this formula is about\n7% for bound mirror pairs [2] and 10% for bound-unbound\nmirror pairs [3].\nThe knowledge of the link between mirror ANCs can be\nbeneficial for predicting unknown ANCs using the unforma-\ntion about known mirror ANCs. The latter can be used in\nnuclear astrophysics to predict or verify nucleon capture cross\nsections at stellar energies. Thus, the proton ANCs for 8B, 9C,\n12N, and 27P have been determined using the measured neutron\nANCs for their mirror analogs 8Li [4], 9Li [5], 12B [6], and\n27Mg [7], respectively, and then have been used to predict\nthe astrophysical S factors for the corresponding nonresonant\n(p,\u03b3 ) reactions on 7Be, 8B, 11C, and 26Si at low energies. Also,\nthe isospin symmetry in bound-unbound mirror pairs has been\nused to predict the neutron ANC for the halo nucleus 15C( 12\n+)\nand the low-energy cross section for the 14C(n,\u03b3 )15C( 12\n+)\nreaction using the measured width of the proton resonance\n15F( 12\n+) [8].\nIn this article, we show that similar consequences of isospin\nsymmetry are present in mirror-conjugated \u03b1 decays. Their\nknowledge may be used in nuclear astrophysics to predict\nimportant (\u03b1, \u03b3 ), (\u03b1,N ), and (N ,\u03b1) cross sections.\nIn Sec. II A we consider bound mirror pairs and derive a\nsimple analytical formula for the ratio of mirror ANCs squared.\nAs in the case of nucleon decays, the formula depends only\non mirror \u03b1-particle binding energies, nuclear charges, and the\nrange of the \u03b1-core potential. We test this formula for the two-\nbody model, where exact numerical solutions are available. In\nSec. II B we make predictions in the microscopic cluster model\n(MCM) for the ANCs of bound mirror pairs 7Li-7Be, 11B-11C,\nand 19F-19Ne in which the \u03b1-decay threshold in the lowest.\nAll three mirror pairs are important for nuclear astrophysics\napplications. In Sec. III we consider bound-unbound mirror\nstates of the same pairs of nuclei both in a two-body model\nand in the MCM. In Sec. IV we discuss isospin symmetry in\nmirror resonance states and in Sec. V we summarize the results\nobtained and draw conclusions.\nII. BOUND MIRROR PAIRS\nA. Two-body model with charge-independent \u03b1-core\nstrong interaction\nWe consider (i) a bound system A\u22124Z\u22122(N \u2212 2) + \u03b1 and\n(ii) its bound mirror analog A\u22124N\u22122(Z \u2212 2) + \u03b1 in a two-body\nmodel. We order these systems is such a way that the binding\nenergy \u03b51 of the first system is larger than the second binding\nenergy \u03b52. We denote this two cores as X1 and X2 and assume\nthat the nuclear \u03b1 \u2212 Xi interaction VN in mirror systems is\nexactly the same so that all the difference in the wave functions\n\u00041 and \u00042 of these mirror systems is determined by different\nCoulomb interactions VC1 and VC2 . In practice, the two mirror\n\u03b1-particle wave functions are close to each other both in the\ninternal nuclear region and on the surface, where the \u03b1 \u2212 Xi\npotential strongly decreases.\n0556-2813\/2007\/75(3)\/034302(11) 034302-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nN.

In the cases considered below, this difference is\nabout 2%.\nThe term R\u03b4\u03c6(a) defined as\nR\u03b4\u03c6(a) =\n\u222b \u221e\na\ndrr2\u03b4\u03c612(r, a)VN\u0004(1)l\n\u2212\n\u222b a\n0\ndrr2\u03b4\u03c612(r, a)VN\t\u000412, (20)\ncontains the function \u03b4\u03c612(r, a), which is equal to zero at\nr = a. Therefore, if a is at a point where VN\u0004(1)l reaches\nits maximum and is a decreasing function at r > a, then the\ncontribution from R\u03b4\u03c6(a) will be small. This point can be\nchosen to be the nuclear radius RN , which for the \u03b1 + X\nsystem is about (1.1\u20131.3)(41\/3 + X1\/3). If at the same time\n\u03c6\n(2)\nl (r)\/\u03c6(1)l (r) varies slowly with r around a, then \u03c612(r, a) \u2248\n0, which guarantees that R\u03b4\u03c6(a) is negligible. However, R\u03b4\u03c6(a)\nincreases if a < RN and \u03c6(2)l \/\u03c6\n(1)\nl at r = RN differs from\nA0(a). Conversely, R\u03b4\u03c6(a) is very small for a > RN .\nThe next term,\nRB(a) = B\n\u222b \u221e\na\ndrrW2\n(\nVN + \tVC2\n)\n\u0004\n(2)\nl\n+B W2\na\u03c6\n(1)\nl\n\u222b a\n0\ndrr2\u03c6\n(1)\nl\n(\nVN + \tVC1\n)\n\u0004\n(2)\nl , (21)\ndepends on B. The B is zero at two points, at a = 0 and at\na = am, where the function A0(a) reaches its maximum (or in\nother words A\u20320(am) = 0). At all other points the contribution\nfrom RB(a) depends on how large is BW2\/a\u03c6(1)l with respect\nto A0(a). We show in the Appendix that\nBW2\na\u03c6\n(1)\nl A0(a)\n= p2(a) \u2212 p1(a)\np2(a) + p1(a) , (22)\nwhere\npi(a) =\n\u221a\n2\u03b7i\u03bai\nr\n+ l(l + 1)\nr2\n+ \u03ba2i . (23)\nFor mirror \u03b1 states p2(a) does not differ much from p1(a),\nespecially near a \u2248 RN . Thus BW2\/a\u03c6(1)l \t A0(a) and, there-\nfore, RB(RN ) will be small compared with \u2212h\u00af2\/2\u00b5A0(a)C(1)l .\nThe last term,\nR\tVC (a) =\n\u222b \u221e\na\ndrr2\n(\n\u03c6\n(2)\nl \tVC2 \u2212 A0(a)\u03c6(1)l \tVC1\n)\n\u0004\n(1)\nl\n\u2212\n\u222b a\n0\ndrr2\n(\n\u03c6\n(2)\nl \tVC2 \u2212 A0(a)\u03c6(1)l \tVC1\n)\n\t\u000412.\n(24)\nis zero for all a greater than the radius of the \u03b1-core Coulomb\ninteraction Rc and is small for a < Rc if \tVCi \t VN . For all\ncases considered below, this condition is satisfied.\nThus, if \u0004(1)l \u2248 \u0004(2)l is a good approximation and if a is\nchosen near RN , then the contributions from all the remainder\nterms Ri(a) are very small and Eq. (18) reduces to\nh\u00af2\n2\u00b5\nC\n(2)\nl = A0(a)\nh\u00af2\n2\u00b5\nC\n(1)\nl . (25)\nThen the ratioR\nR = (C(2)l \/C(1)l )2 (26)\nof the mirror squared ANCs can be approximated by the\nmodel-independent analytical expression\nR \u2248 R0 = A20(RN ) =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03ba1Fl(i\u03ba2RN )\u03ba2Fl(i\u03ba1RN )\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n. (27)\nThe accuracy of this approximation depends on how rapidly\nA0(RN ) changes over the region of uncertainty of RN . In all\ncases considered below this function varies slowly around RN\n(see the insets in Fig. 1 where A0(a)\/A0(am) is plotted).\nThe approximation (27) is similar to the formula,\n(\nCp\nCn\n)2\n\u2248\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 Fl(i\u03bapRN )\u03bapRNjl(i\u03banRN )\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n, (28)\nobtained in Ref. [1] for ANCs Cp and Cn of mirror proton\nand neutron virtual decays, respectively. In principle, Eq. (27)\ncould be obtained from Eq. (28) by replacing the spheri-\ncal Bessel function jl(i\u03banr) by Fl(i\u03ba1RN )\/\u03ba1RN . However,\nEq. (28) has been obtained in Ref. [1] starting from different\nassumptions. Namely, it was explicitly assumed that the main\ncontribution to the ANC comes only from internal nuclear\nregion, r \u0002RN , that the Coulomb interactions inside the\nnuclear region can be replaced by constants and that the\ndifference between these constants is equal to the difference\nin proton and neutron binding energies. Our exact two-body\ncalculations have shown that the accuracy of these assumptions\nis much worse than the accuracy of the formula (27) itself. In\nparticular, all \u03b1-particle wave functions have nodes because\nof the Pauli principle, which causes cancellations between\nsome contributions to the ANC from the internal region so\nthat the contributions from the surface become important.\nFor large orbital momentum l the surface region, in which\nthe nuclear potential decreases, is even more important. We\nillustrate this in the insets of Fig. 1 by plotting some examples\nof C2(a)\/C2, where the ANC C2(a) has been calculated\nneglecting the contributions from r > a in Eq. (3). Quite\noften the r \u0002RN region gives only half the contribution to\nthe ANC. The derivation of Eq. (27) in the present article is\nquite general and it suggests that Eq.

The sensitivity of the ratioR to the potential choice\nwas less than 2%. Both the exact ratiosRPM and the analytical\napproximationsR0 are given in Table I. Because in all cases am\nwas very close to RN and A0(a) changed very slowly around\nRN , theR0 values from Table II were calculated at RN = am.\nThe ratio RPM\/R0 is also plotted in Fig. 2. One can see that\nRPM andR0 agree on average within 2% or less. For 7Li-7Be\nthis agreement is slightly worse, about 3\u20134%, which can be\nexplained by the larger difference in internal wave functions\ndue to the smaller Coulomb interaction.\nB.

In all three\nmirror pairs considered in this article, the oscillator radius\nthat provides a good description of the \u03b1 particle differs\nsignificantly from that of the core. Dealing with different b\nfor each of the cluster would create big difficulties in using the\nMCM. Therefore, we use the same value of b for both clusters\nbut do the calculations twice. The first time we use b = 1.36 fm\nthat reproduces the root-mean-square radius of the \u03b1 particle\nand minimizes its binding energy, and the second time we\nuse either b = 1.5 fm (to describe the triton and\/or 3He core\nfor the 7Li-7Be mirror pair) or b = 1.6 fm (for 11B-11C and\n19F-19Ne). Our previous calculations for 17O-17F have shown\nthat different oscillator radii change strongly the absolute value\nof neutron and proton ANCs but does not change their ratio\nvery much [2]. In the three-cluster calculations for the 11B-11C\nmirror pair we used only one value of the oscillator radius,\nb = 1.36 fm, the same as in Ref. [10].\nFor each oscillator radius, we use two NN potentials, the\nVolkov potential V2 [12] and the Minnesota (MN) potential\n[13], except in three-cluster calculations for 11B-11C where\nonly V2 is used. The two-body spin-orbit force [14] with\nS0 = 30 MeV\u00b7fm5 and the Coulomb interaction are also\nincluded. Both V2 and MN have one adjustable parameter that\ngives the strength of the odd NN potentials V11 and V33. We\nfit this parameter in each case to reproduce the experimental\nvalues for the \u03b1-particle separation energies. Slightly different\nadjustable parameters in mirror nuclei, needed to reproduce\nthese energies, simulate charge symmetry breaking of the\neffective NN interactions, which could be a consequence of\ncharge symmetry breaking in realistic NN interactions. The\nrange of changes in squared ANCs with different input MCM\nparameters is shown in Fig. 2. Similar to previous studies of\none-nucleon ANCs in Refs. [2,8,15], the V2 potential gives\nlarger C2\u03b1 values than the MN (up to a factor of 2) at a\nfixed oscillator radius b and the different choices of b give\na comparable change (up to the factor of 2) in C2\u03b1 at a fixed NN\npotential. The average value of RMCM is compared in Table I\nto the analytical estimate R0 and to predictions within the\npotential modelRPM.\nWe have also calculated the \u03b1-particle spectroscopic factors\nS\u03b1 defined as\nS\u03b1 =\n(\nA\n4\n)\u222b \u221e\n0\ndrr2\n\u2223\u2223\u2329[\u000bJXiXi \u2297 Yl(r\u02c6)]JA\u000b\u03b1\n\u2223\u2223\u0004JAA \u232a\u2223\u22232 (33)\nand have shown their range of variation in Fig. 2. The ratio\nRMCMS = S\u03b1(2)\/S\u03b1(1) of these spectroscopic factors is given\nin Table I.

As in the\ncase of mirror virtual nucleon decays studied in Ref. [2,16],\nthe approximate equality RMCMb\u03b1 \u2248 RPM means that in mirror\nnuclei the effective local nuclear \u03b1-core interaction can be\nconsidered to be the same. We now discuss individual mirror\npairs in more detail.\n034302-6\nISOSPIN SYMMETRY IN MIRROR \u03b1 DECAYS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 034302 (2007)\n1. 7Li-7Be\nThe squared ANCs in these mirror nuclei change by about\n55% with different oscillator radii and NN potentials. However,\nthe ratio C\u03b1(7Be)\/C\u03b1(7Li) changes by only about 1.5% both\nin the ground and the first excited states. This ratio differs\nfrom the analytical estimate R0 by no more than 3 and 4%\nfor the ground and the first excited states, respectively, and\nagrees reasonably well with the potential model calculations.\nThe mirror symmetry in spectroscopic factors is also clearly\nseen. Some minor differences in RMCMb\u03b1 and RPM are present,\nwhich means that the effective local nuclear t + \u03b1 and\n3He+\u03b1 interactions differ slightly. Because the 7Li and 7Be\nANCs determine the cross sections for the 3H(\u03b1, \u03b3 )7Li and\n3He(\u03b1, \u03b3 )7Be capture reactions at zero energies, the mirror\nsymmetry of the \u03b1-particle ANCs means that relations should\nexist between the astrophysical S factors of these reactions.\nThus, with our value of RMCM the ratio S34(7Be)\/S34(7Li) at\nzero energy is 6.6 and 5.9 for the ground and the first excited\nstates, respectively.\n2. 11B-11C\nThe calculations for this mirror pair have been performed\nfor all excited states that are below the \u03b1-particle emission\nthreshold in 11C. In the two-cluster model, only the ground\nand the 12\n\u2212 first excited state in the 7Li-7Be mirror cores have\nbeen taken into account. In the three-cluster model, both the\n7Li+\u03b1 (7Be + \u03b1) and t + 8Be (3He + 8Be) partitions are taken\ninto account with the first excited states 12\n\u2212\n, 32\n\u2212\n, 52\n\u2212\nand 72\n\u2212 in\n7Li (7Be) and the first 0+ and 2+ states in 8Be included [10].\nThe squared ANCs calculated in the two-cluster MCM\nchange with different NN potential and oscillator radius choice\nby the factor of 4 on average. Taking two-cluster nature of 7Li\nand 7Be into account in most cases significantly increases\nANCs, thus increasing the range of their variations with\nmodel assumptions. However, in all cases the ratio RMCM\nchanges by no more than 9%. The RMCM values obtained\nin the two-cluster model are close to the analytical estimate\nR0 and to the potential model prediction RPM, agreement\nbeing within 1\u20135% (see Table I). For the second 32\n\u2212\nstate with\nl = 2, a larger deviation fromR0 andRPM (5\u201310%) coincides\nwith larger symmetry breaking in the mirror spectroscopic\nfactors.\nThe RMCM values obtained in the three-cluster MCM are\nsignificantly larger than the predictions of the two-cluster\nmodel. This is caused mainly by the influence of the t + 8Be\nand 3He+8Be channels. When these channels are removed, so\nthat only the 7Li+\u03b1 and 7Be+\u03b1 partitions are left, then both\nthe two-cluster and three-cluster MCM predict very similar\nresults for the ratio RMCM. At the same time, the ratio of\nmirror spectroscopic factors is not very much influenced by the\nt + 8Be (3He+8Be) clustering, although for the 52\n+\nstate with\nl = 3 it is slightly reduced. This happens because the effective\nlocal \u03b1-7Li and \u03b1-7Be interactions differ. This can be seen by\ncomparing theRMCMb\u03b1 obtained in the three-cluster calculations\nwithRPM. In two-body calculations these quantities agree with\neach other within the uncertainties of their calculations for\nmost of the mirror states.\n3. 19F-19Ne\nThe two-cluster MCM calculations for this mirror pair\nhave been performed for all excited states that are below\nthe \u03b1-particle emission threshold in 19Ne. The mirror cores\n15N-15O were considered both in the ground and the first\nexcited state 32\n\u2212\n. We have found that different choices of\nthe oscillator radius strongly influence the mixture of the\n\u03b1+15N( 12\n\u2212) and \u03b1+15N( 32\n\u2212) configurations in all the states\nof 19F, leading to large changes in spectroscopic factors and\nANCs. The same is true for the \u03b1+15O( 12\n\u2212) and \u03b1+15O( 32\n\u2212)\nconfigurations in 19Ne. However, despite the 3\u20135 times change\nin squared ANCs, the ratio RMCM of mirror squared ANCs\nchanges by less 3.5%. This ratio is close to both the analytical\nestimate R0 and the predictions of the potential model RPM.\nThe deviation between RMCM and these estimates does not\nexceed 5%. The mirror symmetry in spectroscopic factors is\nalso clearly seen. In most cases RMCMb\u03b1 and RPM agree within\nuncertainties of their definition, which means that mirror\nsymmetry in the effective local \u03b1+15N and \u03b1+15O interactions\nis a good assumption.\nIII. BOUND-UNBOUND MIRROR PAIRS\nThe symmetry in mirror\u03b1 decays can be extended to bound-\nunbound mirror pairs. As in the case of nucleon decays [1,3],\nsuch a symmetry would manifest itself as a link between the\nANC of the bound \u03b1-particle state and the width of its analog\nresonant state. This follows from the possibility to represent\nthe resonance width by an integral similar to (3) and (30).\nFor isolated narrow resonances, the generalization of Eq. (17)\nof Ref. [3] for the two-body \u03b1-particle case gives the width\n\r0l as\n\r0l \u2248\n2\u03baR\nER\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u222b Rm\n0\ndrrFl(\u03baRr)(VN \u2212 \tVC)\u0004BSAl (r)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n, (34)\nwhere ER is the resonance energy, kR =\n\u221a\n2\u00b5ER\/h\u00af2, Fl is the\nregular Coulomb wave function and \u0004BSAl is a wave function\nof the \u03b1-particle resonance in the bound-state approximation.\nThis function has the dimension of a bound-state wave function\nand is defined and normalized within some channel radius Rm\ntaken well outside the range of the \u03b1-core interaction. The\nwidth \r0l defined by Eq. (34) is related to the residue \u03b3 2l at the\nR-matrix pole by [17],\n\r0l = 2\u03baRRm\u03b3 2l\n\/|Ol(\u03baRRm)|2, (35)\nwhere Ol is the outgoing Coulomb function. It determines the\nobservable width \rl by\n\rl = \r0l\n\/(\n1 + \u03b3 2l S \u2032l\n)\u22121\n, (36)\nwhere Sl = Re(\u03baRRmO \u2032l \/Ol) and the derivation is performed\nwith over the energy E. For very narrow resonances, such that\n\u03b3 2l S\n\u2032\nl \t 1, the observed width, \rl , and the one related to the\nresidue in the R-matrix pole, \r0l , are the same. It is for such\ncases that the analytical expression for the ratio\nR\r = \r\u03b1\n\/\nC2\u03b1 (37)\n034302-7\nN. K. TIMOFEYUK, P. DESCOUVEMONT, AND R. C.

The ratios |Fl(kRa)Fl(i\u03bab.s.am)\/Fl(i\u03bab.s.a)Fl(kRam)| as a\nfunction of a.\ncan be derived. Following the reasoning of Sec. II A we get\nthe approximate model-independent formula\nR\r \u2248 Rres0 =\nh\u00af2kR\n\u00b5\n\u03b5b.s.\nER\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 Fl(kRRN )Fl(i\u03bab.s.RN )\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n(38)\nwhere \u03b5b.s. is the binding energy of a bound \u03b1-particle state\nand \u03bab.s. =\n\u221a\n2\u00b5\u03b5b.s.\/h\u00af. As in the case of bound mirror pairs,\nthe difference between Rres0 and the exact value of R\r will\nbe determined by remainder terms similar to those given in\nEqs. (15), (19), (20), (21), and (24), and their magnitude will\ndepend on how similar are the bound state \u03b1-particle wave\nfunction and its mirror analog \u0004BSAl . As for bound mirror\npairs, the formula (38) will be more accurate if the function\n|Fl(kRr)\/Fl(i\u03bab.s.r)| varies slowly near r \u2248 RN . This function\nchanges the most slowly near its maximum, at r = am.\nIn Fig. 3 we plot the function |Fl(kRa)Fl(i\u03bab.s.am)\/\nFl(i\u03bab.s.a)Fl(kRam)| for three mirror pairs of excited\nstates 11B( 32\n\u2212\n3 , 8.560 MeV)-11C( 32\n\u2212\n3 , 8.105 MeV), 19F( 32\n+\n2 ,\n3.908 MeV)-19Ne( 32\n+\n2 , 4.033 MeV), and 19F( 72\n\u2212\n2 , 3.999 MeV)-\n19F( 72\n\u2212\n2 , 4.197 MeV). The \u03b1 particle in the chosen states of\n11B and 19F is weakly bound and its mirror states in 11C and\n19Ne are resonances that are important for some astrophysical\napplications. This ratio is almost a constant for r \u223c 4 \u2212 6 fm\nthat is close to RN .\nWe compare Rres0 , calculated assuming RN = am, to R\r\nobtained in exact two-body calculations. To perform the two-\nbody calculations, we have chosen an \u03b1-core potential of the\nWoods-Saxon form and varied its diffuseness from 0.35 to\n0.95 fm. For each diffuseness the depth and the radius of this\npotential were adjusted to reproduce simultaneously both the\n\u03b1-particle separation energy \u03b5b.s. in a chosen state and the\nposition ER of the resonance in its mirror analog. The width\nhas been determined from the behavior of the resonant phase\nshift tan \u03b4l = \rl(E)\/2(E \u2212 ER) near ER . The range of change\nin squared ANCs and in resonance widths with the potential\ngeometry is presented in Table III. The widths change by a\nfactor from 1.65 to 4.1 and the ANCs squared in the mirror\nstates change by the same amount so thatRresPM changes by less\nthan 2% with respect to an average value. These average values\nare very close toRres0 when l\u03b1 \u000b= 0. In the l\u03b1 = 0 case, when the\ncentrifugal barrier in absent, the approximation (38) becomes\nless accurate, withRresPM being smaller thanRres0 by 12%. This\nloss of accuracy is probably caused by a larger difference in\nmirror s-wave functions when one of the \u03b1 particles is loosely\nbound. In all cases, the agreement between RresPM and Rres0 is\nmuch better than for nucleon decays in bound-unbound mirror\npairs [3].\nTo check the validity of the approximation (38) for many-\nbody systems we have calculated R\r for bound-unbound\nmirror states from Table II using the MCM of the previous\nsection. The width \r\u03b1 have been calculated by solving the\nSchro\u00a8dinger-Bloch equation, as described in Ref. [11]. The\ncalculations have been done using two oscillator radii for\npotential V2 and only one oscillator radius, 1.36 fm, for\npotential MN, because the larger radius, b = 1.6 fm, has\ncaused numerical problems. The resulting ratio RMCM\r is\nTABLE III.

The relation between mirror widths is usually\nobtained from the relation of the width \r\u03b1 to the Coulomb\nbarrier penetration factor Pl(E,RN ) and the reduced width\n\u03b82\u03b1 [17]:\n\r\u03b1 = 2h\u00af\n2\n\u00b5R2N\n\u03b82\u03b1Pl(E,RN ), (41)\nwhere\nPl(E,RN ) = kRN\nF 2l (kRN ) + G2l (kRN )\n, (42)\nG2l (kRN ) is the irregular Coulomb function, and RN is located\nsomewhere on the surface.

Unlike in\nprevious sections, only one value of the diffuseness, 0.65 fm,\nhas been used in the potential model calculations. As for the\nMCM, the conditions of the calculations are the same as in\nprevious sections.\nThe calculated widths \r\u03b1 in mirror resonances and their\nratio are presented in Table III, where they are compared\nto R0\r\r and R\u03b8\r\r . In all cases studied, \r\u03b1 depends strongly\non the choice of the model and its parameters. For the\n7Li-7Be and 19F-19Ne mirror pairs, the ratios RMCM\r\r and\nRPM\r\r agree very well with the analytical predictions R0\r\r and\nR\u03b8\r\r . For 7Li-7Be they also agree with experimental value\nRexp\r\r = \rexp\u03b1 (7Be)\/\rexp\u03b1 (7Li) = 1.88 \u00b1 0.24 obtained using\nthe 7Li and 7Be widths of the 72\n\u2212\nresonance from Ref. [20].\nFor the 52\n\u2212\n2 resonance in\n19F-19Ne, the valueRexp\r\r = 121 \u00b1 55\ndetermined by using \rexp\u03b1 from Ref. [19] is much smaller than\nthe theoretical values of 203\u2013211. The most likely reason for\nthis is that the 19Ne( 52\n\u2212\n2 ) width has been determined Ref. [19]\nindirectly using the measured 19Ne( 52\n\u2212\n2 ) branching ratio \r\u03b1\/\r\nand its \u03b3 width assuming that \r\u03b3 (19F) = \r\u03b3 (19Ne). Such an\nassumption is not always valid.\nFor 11B-11C, RPM\r\r agrees very well with the analytical\npredictions R0\r\r and R\u03b8\r\r . The two-cluster MCM predictions\nalso agree with them, expect for the 52\n\u2212\n2 state with l\u03b1 = 2,\nwhere a 10% increase in the ratio of mirror widths can\nbe seen. The three-cluster MCM increases this ratio, which\ncould be due to the 8Be+t and 8Be+3He clustering effects.\nBoth the two- and three-cluster predictions agree with the\nratioRexp\r\r = 2140 \u00b1 970 of experimentally determined widths\ntaken from Ref. [21]. In all cases, the difference between the\nmicroscopic calculations and the analytical approximations\n(40) and (43) does not exceed 10%.\nV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nIn this article, we have shown that the structureless two-\nbody bound mirror systems \u03b1 + X1 and \u03b1 + X2, with the same\nstrong nuclear attraction but different Coulomb repulsion,\nshould have ANCs that are related by a model-independent\nanalytical approximation (27). This expression involves the\nratio of the regular Coulomb wave functions calculated at\nimaginary momentum at some distance a between \u03b1 and X.\nWe have demonstrated that if this distance is taken at the\npoint where the product of the \u03b1 \u2212 X potential and \u03b1 \u2212 X\nwave function is the largest, which occurs around RN \u2248\n(1.1\u20131.3)(41\/3 + X1\/3), then deviation from this approxima-\ntion should be small provided the nuclear wave functions of\nthese mirror systems are similar to each other in the region that\ngives most contribution to the ANC in Eq. (3). The analytical\napproximation (27) remains valid for mirror systems with a\nmany-body internal structure if mirror spectroscopic factors\nare approximately the same and if the cores X1 and X2 are\nnot too strongly deformed and\/or do not have easily excited\nlow-lying states.\nThe isospin symmetry between mirror \u03b1 decays extends to\nbound-unbound and unbound mirror pairs. In the first case,\na link between the \u03b1-particle ANC of a bound state and the\nwidth of its mirror unbound analog is given by the formula\n(38). In the second case, the link between the widths of mirror\nresonances can be given by a new formula (40) that at the\nenergies well below the combined Coulomb and centrifugal\nbarrier complements the old formula (43) obtained using\nthe concept of the penetrability of the Coulomb barrier and\nassuming equality of the reduced widths of mirror resonances.\nThe deviations from these formulas are expected due to\ndeformation and excitations of the core, however, a state lying\nabove a higher threshold in one channel and below in the other\none, might lead to strong deviations too.\nThe comparison of the approximations (27), (38), and\n(40) to the results of exact calculations either in a two-body\npotential model or in a microscopic cluster model for three\nmirror pairs, 7Li-7Be, 11B-11C, and 19F-19Ne, have confirmed\ntheir validity for many mirror nuclear states. The deviations\nfrom these approximations are smaller than those seen in\nmirror nucleon decays in Ref. [2,3] because the difference\nin mirror \u03b1-particle wave functions are much smaller than\nthe differences in mirror proton and neutron wave functions,\nespecially for loosely bound states. The largest deviations from\nanalytical estimates have been seen for three-cluster 11B-11C\nmirror states with excited 7Li and 7Be cores. Also, a noticeable\ndeviation has been seen for the second 72\n\u2212\nstate in 19F-19Ne.\nThis state has tiny spectroscopic factors for the decay channels\n\u03b1+15Ng.s. and \u03b1+15Og.s. (about 0.001) and the probability of\nsymmetry breaking in such week components is always large.\nThe ANCs and \u03b1-widths calculated in our microscopic\napproach are sensitive to the model assumptions. In particular,\nthey change within a factor of four for different choices\nof the effective NN potential and oscillator parameters,\nthe smallest values being produced by combining the MN\npotential with the oscillator parameter b = 1.36 fm and\nthe largest values predicted by V2 with b = 1.6 fm. The\nvariation of ANCs and \u03b1-widths with model assumptions\ncan be even stronger if mirror states have specific structure,\nfor example, the t + 8Be and 3He+8Be configurations in\n11B and 11C. However, as predicted by Eqs. (27), (38)\nand (40), the calculated in the MCM ratios R,R\r , and\nR\r\r do not change much with different choices of unput\nmodel parameters. This fact can be used to predict unknown\nANCs or \u03b1 widths if the corresponding mirror quantities\nhave been measured. Such predictions can be beneficial\nfor nuclear astrophysics. Many low-energy (\u03b1, \u03b3 ), (\u03b1,N ),\nand (N,\u03b1) reactions proceed via the population of isolated\n\u03b1-particle narrow resonances the widths of which determine\nthe corresponding reaction rates. It is not always possible to\nmeasure such widths because of the very small reaction cross\nsections involved. In this case, using isospin symmetry in\nmirror \u03b1 decays may be helpful. For unbound mirror states\nthis symmetry has already been used. For another class of\nmirror pairs, when the mirror analogs of the resonances are\nbound, \u03b1 widths can be determined by measuring the ANCs\nof bound states in \u03b1-transfer reactions and using the relation\n034302-10\nISOSPIN SYMMETRY IN MIRROR \u03b1 DECAYS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 034302 (2007)\n\r\u03b1 = R\rC2\u03b1 . As an example, we can point out that the\nwidths of the astrophysically important resonance 19Ne( 32\n+\n2 )\nat 4.033 MeV could be detemined if the ANC of its mirror\nanalog in 19F was known. Unfortunately, available data on\nthe 15N(6Li,d)19F\u2217( 32\n+\n2 ) reaction do not allow the extraction\nthe ANC of interest because of strong sensitivity to optical\npotentials and to the geometry of the bound-state potential well\nthat arises due to angular momentum mismatch. An alternative\npossibility to measure this ANC with a high precision is to\nuse the reaction 15N(19F,15N)19F\u2217. This reaction involves the\nsame optical potentials in the entrance and exit channels and\nwould not suffer the angular momentum mismatch.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nSupport from the UK EPSRC via grant GR\/T28577 is\ngratefully acknowledged.\nAPPENDIX\nWe prove here that BW2\/a\u03c6(1)l is small with respect to\nA0(a). The coefficients A and B that are found from the\ncontinuity of \u02dc\u03c6(2)l (r) and its derivative at r = a can alternatively\nbe presented as follows:\nA = (W2\/a)\n\u2032\u03c6(2)l \u2212 (W2\/a)\u03c6\u2032(2)l\n(W2\/a)\u2032\u03c6(1)l \u2212 (W2\/a)\u03c6\u2032(1)l\n, (A1)\nB = \u2212 \u03c6\n\u2032(1)\nl \u03c6\n(2)\nl \u2212 \u03c6(1)l \u03c6\u2032(2)l\n\u03c6\n\u2032(1)\nl (W2\/a) \u2212 \u03c6(1)l (W2\/a)\u2032\n, (A2)\nwhere the prime symbol means differentiation with respect\nto a. When expressed in terms of F1, F2, and W2 we find\nB = \u2212exp(\u0131\u03b42)\n\u03ba2\nF2F\n\u2032\n1 \u2212 F \u20322F1\nW2F\n\u2032\n1 \u2212 W \u20322F1\n, (A3)\nwhere \u03b42 = \u2212(l + 1 + \u0131\u03b72)\u03c0\/2. Therefore the quantity\nBW2\/[a\u03c6(1)l A0(a)] is\nBW2\/(a\u03c6l(1)A0(a)) = \u2212 F\n\u2032\n1\/F1 \u2212 F \u20322\/F2\nF \u20321\/F1 \u2212 W \u20322\/W2\n. (A4)\nWe can get a good idea about the magnitude of this term\nby using semiclassical expressions for the Fi and W2. For our\npurposes we can write\nW2(a) =\nW2(b) exp\n[\u2212 \u222b a\nb\ndrp2(r)\n]\n\u221a\np2(a)\/p2(b)\n, (A5)\nFi(a) =\nFi(b) exp\n[+ \u222b a\nb\ndrpi(r)\n]\n\u221a\npi(a)\/pi(b)\n, (A6)\nwhere the local wave numbers pi(r) are given by\npi(r) =\n\u221a\n2\u03b7i\u03bai\nr\n+ l(l + 1)\nr2\n+ \u03ba2i , (A7)\nand b is an arbitrary point in the region where the semiclassical\napproximation is valid. We also assume that a and b lie in the\nregion where the exponentially decreasing components of the\nFi can be ignored.\nUsing these expressions and evaluating the derivatives in a\nway that consistently respects the semiclassical approximation\n(see Ref. [22], pp. 23\u201324) we find\nBW2\n\/[\na\u03c6\n(1)\nl A0(a)\n] = p2(a) \u2212 p1(a)\np2(a) + p1(a) . (A8)\nFor values of a in the nuclear surface the difference p2(a) \u2212\np1(a) tends to be very small fraction of p2(a) + p1(a). Note\nthat the condition p1(a) \u2212 p2(a) = 0 is exactly the condition\n(in the semiclassical approximation) that A0(a) be a stationary\nfunction of a.\n[1] N. K. Timofeyuk, R. C. Johnson, and A.
