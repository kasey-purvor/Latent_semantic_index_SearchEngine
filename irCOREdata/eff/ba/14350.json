A corollary to this question is how and\nwhat instructional technologies can be brought to address this search for particular\ncontexts? While there is a wide range of instructional delivery technologies we can choose\nfrom, our choice must be carefully considered. The number of factors to be considered are\ntoo many to list here, but must include a cognizance of the nature of the content or skill\nthat comprises the subject matter of instruction, the learners, the time and their place of\nstudy, and the costs of the delivery mode, both for the learners and the institution. This\npaper reports our experience of the first phase of a three-phased integration of Computer-\nMediated Communication (CMC) aimed at improving instructional effectiveness.\nInterest in the application of some form of CMC in the enhancement of teaching-learning\nenvironments is currently widespread. This has led to the emergence of a growing body of\nliterature on various aspects of CMC-based instructional delivery systems (for example,\nMason and Kaye, 1989; Harasim, 1993; Mason, 1993; Wells, 1993). While there exists in\nthis literature a great deal of information on the hardware and software requirements for\n63\nSom Naidu et al Improving instructional effectiveness wirh computer-mediated communication\nsuch delivery systems, and numerous reports of applications in a wide variety of contexts,\nrelatively little attention is focused on approaches to the integration of CMC in teaching-\nlearning environments.\nThe project reported in this paper is about the design of instructionally effective CMC-\nbased teaching-learning environments. The emphasis here is not on the hardware or the\nsoftware requirements but on the organization and presentation of subject matter, the\ndesigned activities, and human factors which are often, in our experience, at the heart of\nthe success or failure of such projects. A phased-integration of computer-mediated\ncommunications technology is described and also recommended to overcome an all-too-\npervasive mindset about teaching that is a carry-over from the conventional face-to-face\nclassroom instructional situation.\nTeaching-learning orientation\nA considerable amount of research exists in favour of teaching-learning designs that\nengenders collaboration and interaction among the peer group (Ide et al, 1981). There is\nevidence, for example, that cooperative learning benefits learning for all except the most\nconcrete, repetitive tasks with effect sizes as high as .8Ocr (Johnson and Johnson, 1974).\nAllowing learners to exercise adaptive control over their learning process is also reported\nas having positive impacts on learning (Hannafin and Colamaio, 1988). CMC-based\nteaching and learning systems are characteristically designed to empower learners by\nallowing them a greater degree of adaptive control over their learning environment which\nis not feasible in conventional systems. This facility refers to the flexibility that learners\nmay have in exercising as much control and autonomy over their learning, as and when\nnecessary.\nThe hypothesized advantages of this electronic teaching-learning environment over the\nconventional system were several. For the learners it was intended to encourage them to\nmove from:\n\u2022 a defined learning space to an open, richer global resource base;\n\u2022 an instructor controlled learning environment (that of a conventional classroom) to a\ncollaborative and co-operative learning context; and\n\u2022 being uncritical recipients of content to dynamic and participant explorers of the\nknowledge base.\nThe orientation of this project is derived from increasing evidence in favour of CMC-\nbased collaborative learning and instructional environments. Its basic philosophy of\nflexible access and an instructor-learner negotiated teaching and learning process is at the\nheart of open learning systems, and increasingly now of conventional face-to-face\nteaching-learning environments which are also aiming for more flexible and adaptive\nformats (see the concept illustrated in Figure 1).\nFigure 1 is a graphic representation of the teaching-learning environment that was\ndesigned and implemented as part of this study. Notice that the focus in the design is on\nintegrating CMC in the teaching-learning environment as one of the resources available\nto the teacher and the learner. Students enter this instructional environment with variable\n64\nAn-j Volume 3 Number 2\nFigure I: Integrating\nCMC in the teoching-\nleaming process\nLearner CMC\nAdtpdva\ncontrol of\nleaning \u2022Uuctures\/capability\nlevels of prior knowledge in the use of CMC as a teaching and learning delivery medium,\nand also with variable levels of motivation to use it. Upon entry, they are confronted with\nan instructional environment that comprises the instructor, subject-matter content and\nCMC-based learning activities, conventional group lecture sessions, tutorial assistance,\nand other forms of individualized and group support. The goal of this instructional\nscenario is to allow the learner a level of flexibility that will enable adaptive control of the\ninstructional environment. For the learner, this means seeking out and receiving as much\ninstructional direction as is necessary, or assuming as much flexibility and freedom as one\ndesires. Such autonomy should also allow the learners to use the instructional resources in\na manner that will suit not only their place and pace of study, but also their learning styles\nand approaches to learning.\nThe intended outcomes of this instructional environment are several. These include\nforemost, for the learner, changed cognitive structures. This means a dramatically new\nand improved way of relating to content, storing it in memory and retrieving it. For the\ninstructor, this arrangement implies new and improved ways of delivering content, and\nalso improved ways of interacting with learners. The instructional delivery system also\nfacilitates the arrangement of subject-matter content in new and interesting dimensions.\nContent can be organized in hypertext formats and include hypermedia to facilitate a\nricher and resourceful instructional and learning environment. All of these outcomes in\nthe end lead to the creation of a new and improved instructional system that is more\nflexible, richer, and a realistic teaching and learning environment.\nContext and subjects\nThe project reported in this paper was carried out in the context of a second-year unit in\nthe Bachelor of Education program in the Faculty of Education at the University of\nSouthern Queensland (Australia). The unit titled Teaching-Learning Studies focused on\nthe classroom teacher and related issues like planning for teaching, instructional\nstrategies, and classroom management. The project ran for a full 13 weeks in Semester 2,\n1994. Subjects in the study were all the students enrolled in the unit.\n65\nSom Naidu et al Improving instructional effectiveness wirh computer-mediated communication\nDesign\nIn order to ensure systematic integration of CMC in the teaching and learning context,\nand to cope with the human factors pervasive in the situation, a three-phased model for\nimplementing CMC was devised (see Figure 2).\n3\n2\n1\nA\nDocument source\nIntegrated MM\nHypertext documents\nMicrosoft Word\n3\n2\n1\nB\nCommunications\nDesktop video +\naudiographics\nComputer conference\n(groupware)\nMicrosoft Mail\nfigure 2:7?ie three-phased\nCMC implementation\nThere are two components to each phase. The first component (A) concerns the\norganization and presentation of the subject matter. At the first level, all subject-matter\ncontent can be created, stored and retrieved as word-processed files. At the second level,\nthe word-processed files are presented as hypertext documents to facilitate such uses as\ncomplete document search, a linked hypertext-type lesson structure, zooming-in and\nmagnifying components, copy and paste to other documents, and insert 'post-it' notes\nand 'bookmarks', etc. The third level extends the hypertext document to include\ninteractive multimedia and activate other programs such as a statistical package.\nThe second component of the system, the communications dimension (B), is similarly\norganized into three layers with the first level operating on electronic mail. The second\nlevel includes text-based conferencing systems and\/or groupware, while the third level\nincludes audiographics and\/or desktop video conferencing.\nThis system provides for a 'stepwise' progression allowing advancement up the layer on\none dimension while operating at a lower level in the other dimension (that is, hypertext\ndocuments and email - A2 Bl), or integrated multimedia documents and conferencing -\nA3 B2). The building of these steps is dependent on the technical infrastructure, skill level\nof students and the teachers, and more importantly, on the nature of subject-matter\ncontent and the desired interactions\/activities between and among all participants.\nFigure 3 represents the implementation model reported in this paper. The current project\nwas designed to represent the first phase of this model. Core content in the model is held\non a file server at level Al as Microsoft Word documents. Level A2 uses CD-ROM as a\nstorage device while level A3 utilizes greater mass storage devices such as Interleaf and\nWorldview. Communication at level 1 was via Microsoft Mail. At level 2, computer\nconferencing is envisaged, and at level 3 we are looking at audiographic communication.\nALT-) Volume 3 Number 2\nFigure 3: USQ\nimplementation model\n3\n2\n1\nA\nDocument source\nI-CON Author*\nInterleaf* Woridview\nInterleaf* Worldview\nMicrosoft Word\n3\n2\n1\nB\nCommunications\nSmart 2000\nComputer conference\nMicrosoft Mail\nNetwork configuration\nThe phase 1 network configurations included 486 33 EISA machines running Windows\n3.0 with Microsoft Word 2.0 and Microsoft Mail. The core lecture content, including the\nlearning activities for each week's study, was input as Word documents. All supporting\nreading materials were scanned and also included as Word documents. Students were\nrequired to log on, read each week's material, and then respond to the required learning\nactivities via Microsoft Mail. Students in the project were registered on the local-area\nnetwork individually, as well as under an alias which was the unit number. A user could\ntherefore send a message to another directly by addressing a message to that individual,\nand also to the whole group by addressing messages to the alias.\nLearning activities\nLearning activities were generated by the instructor on a weekly basis. These activities\nwere carefully designed to focus on the subject-matter content that was being covered\nduring that week. In the first week, for example, students examined the topic of 'direct\ninstruction' as an instructional strategy. Students were exposed to a discussion on the\ntopic by the instructor. This was accessible as a Word document. After reading and\nsynthesizing this material, students were required to respond to the learning activities that\nwere generated by the instructor. Some activities required further reading, others required\nsome field work, and others required summarizing or synthesizing.\nOn-line response patterns\nResponses to these instructor-generated learning activities were transmitted via email to\nthe student-group alias, which meant that it went out to all the students registered under\nthat alias, including the instructor. Each student's response was therefore received by all\nthe others in the group. Individuals could comment on all the responses that were made,\nand especially those that raised controversial or interesting issues. The instructor was in a\nposition to observe the transactions that were going on via email and make his own\ncontributions to the discussion. He would make his own contributions and also provide\nfeedback to the student commentaries. Students could also send messages to individuals\nin the group, which would then comprise private communications as neither the\n67\nSom Naidu et al Improving instructional effectiveness wirfi computer-mediated communication\ninstructor nor anyone else in the group could have access to that message, unless such a\nmessage was copied or forwarded to a third or fourth individual in the group.\nData sources\nThe objective of data collection was focused on the use and utility of the CMC-based\ndelivery environment to the stakeholders (that is, instructors and learners). Hence mostly\nethnographic data-gathering techniques were employed. These included in-depth\ninterviewing of learners during and after the process, and also analysis of the texts from\nthe online interactions. Questions asked, focused on various aspects of the delivery system\nand their interface with it. These included training in the use of email; the benefits and\ndisadvantages of the delivery mode; the changed role of the instructor; the technology-\nhuman interface in online communication; impacts on learning outcomes; and problems\nwith reading text online and other concerns relating to online communication. All\ninterview protocols were tape-recorded and transcribed for further analysis.\nAnalysis of Data\nThe interviews were conducted using the following specific headings:\n\u2022 training for the project;\n\u2022 instructional delivery system;\n\u2022 changed role of the instructor;\n\u2022 technology-human interface;\n\u2022 learning experiences.\nObservations\nPreparatory training\nLearners reported being generally satisfied with the training that was provided in the use\nof email and online communication at the start of the project. There was a view that the\ntraining could have been more effective if it had been focused on specific needs of learners\nwith variable levels of expertise with the email software and online communication. Most\nfelt that a list (in print form) of the most common features of Microsoft Mail would have\nhelped a lot. Some of the learners found certain components of the training redundant,\nand which could therefore have been eliminated with better design, delivery and co-\nordination of the training programme.\nThe instructional delivery system\nParticipants felt that, while this new mode of delivery was 'different', it offered them\nmuch needed flexibility in the way of their place, pace and time of study. The general\ndisposition was that this was a more time-efficient way of making content and instructor\nexpertise more accessible to learners.\nChanged role of the instructor\nThe use of CMC in instructional delivery meant a significant change in the role of the\nhuman teacher. While CMC allowed the instructor a greater degree of interaction with\n68\nfia-j Vo\/ume 3 Number 2\nindividual students in the class, it also increased the instructor's workload. Even though\nlearners realized that they were in contact with their instructor online 24 hours a day, the\nlack of face-to-face contact with the instructor in a CMC-based instructional environment\nwas missed by the students. There was an overall preference for retaining some face-to-\nface contact in this predominantly electronic teaching-learning environment.\nTechnology-human interface\nFor the computer-literate, a CMC-based teaching-learning environment posed little prob-\nlem. For the computer-illiterate however, this delivery mode was a source of much anxiety.\nThe experience from this project revealed that several factors, if not carefully managed,\ncould lead to the failure of such systems. These include issues relating to moderation of\ndiscussions, careful management of dominant personalities, and use of acceptable online\nconversation protocols. The asynchronous nature of the medium meant that a response\nfrom the intended recipients of a comment was not available or 'visible' immediately as is\nthe case in face-to-face contexts. A few of the participants found it rather frustrating\nhaving to wait for 24 or more hours to get some response on their comments and queries.\nSome students found reading and composing on-screen somewhat difficult. This was not\nunexpected. Initially, students preferred to read offline, compose their message on a word\nprocessor, then send the message as an attachment to an email message. This was a very\ntime-consuming and tedious exercise that detracted from one of the obvious advantages\nof CMC systems, which is the spontaneity with which messages can be received and\nresponded to. With some practice, however, students were able to read comfortably on-\nscreen and also compose messages online.\nLearning experiences\nA majority of the students felt that one of the significant outcomes of the CMC-based\ndelivery system was the shift in the degree of control learners could exercise in their\nlearning. In the conventional face-to-face context, their instructors made a lot of the\ndecisions about how and when things were supposed to happen. In the CMC-based\nsystem, the learners took over a greater degree of responsibility of their learning patterns,\ndetermining for themselves how and when things would be done. In some cases there was\na commensurate increase in the amount of time students spent on studying. Students\nenjoyed the opportunity to interact with their peers in an on-going manner without being\nconstrained by the hours of a lecture and tutorial session. Students reported getting more\n'involved' in their study.\nThere were some negatives as well. One of the problems that seemed to concern students\nabout online communication was that of being misunderstood and not able to defend or\nexplain one's comments before the others were already in an attack mode. In a face-to-\nface mode, if one felt that a comment was being misunderstood or misrepresented, there\nwas the opportunity to correct it right there and then. In a CMC-based delivery mode,\nhowever, once a message had been posted, it was out in the open for its recipients to make\nwhatever out of it, and it was only after some time, usually after a day or so, that one\ncould correct oneself or clarify the misunderstanding of the others. An advantage of the\npossibility of this occurring was that learners were forced to think through their ideas and\ncomments a lot more clearly before broadcasting these online. Some students found that\nin so doing they were improving their reading, writing and thinking skills.\n69\nSom Naidu et ol Improving instructional effectiveness wirti computer-mediated communication\nDiscussion\nA CMC-based delivery system is fundamentally different from a face-to-face teaching-\nlearning environment. It carries with it, among other things, a uniquely different student\nand instructor mindset. Like any other instructional delivery system, a CMC-based\nteaching-learning environment has its strengths and weaknesses for learning and teaching\noutcomes. Its success, in these terms, is dependent on a number of design considerations\nthat are unique to it. These considerations and their implications on teaching and learning\nin a CMC-based instructional delivery system are discussed in the remainder of this\npaper.\nImplications for system management\nAn integral part of the success of a CMC-based instructional system is the function of the\nsystem manager. This is a person who is responsible for network upkeep and\nmaintenance. Teaching and learning using CMC requires maintenance and support of\nemail communications, word processing and transferring of files and material from word-\nprocessed documents to mail and vice versa. Many things do and can go wrong in this\nprocess, especially when dealing with students and instructors who lack much experience\nwith operating in this mode.\nIt must be understood by all parties concerned that there is a protocol for online\ncommunication. These have been widely documented in the literature on CMC-based\ninstructional systems (see Harasim, 1993). Stakeholders must be given initial training in\nthese and their use with continuous support and reinforcement throughout the process. It\nmust be understood that there will be a slow start, and that as students and instructors\nbecome familiar with the delivery medium, the pace will pick up. This underscores the\nneed for that front-end training and on-going support to be carefully planned and\nexecuted.\nImplications for the instructor\nThis refers to the perceptions that instructors hold about their roles as teachers. Usually\nthese perceptions are a result of their own training as teachers, or requirements of their\ninstitution, and years of work experience in conventional or other educational systems.\nThe principal tasks of teachers in conventional face-to-face instructional systems, for\ninstance, are to prepare lectures, deliver them, hold small group tutorial sessions, and\nmark written assignments.\nA CMC-based teaching-learning environment prescribes a different set of tasks for the\ninstructor. These include, among other things, the development of the core content in\nadvance of the actual instruction, presenting these online, and communicating with\nstudents on a continual basis in an asynchronous mode. The instructor takes on a\nfacilitator's role, reading and responding to student's work and clarifying any\nmisconceptions as they arise. The instructor is no longer tied down to lecture or tutorial\ntimes. All of this happens asynchronously and in a 'fluid' teaching-learning context. For\nsome instructors this may mean additional work which may lead to the fear of being\neternally 'on the job'. The truth is that a CMC-based instructional environment, if\ncarefully planned and executed, has the potential to save time and effort for the instructor\n- time which previously had been taken up by routine and repetitive tasks such as grading\npaper-based work and answering generic types of queries.\n70\nALT-J Volume 3 Number 2\nMany instructors also find this to be a rather 'loose' arrangement in which they relinquish\ntheir control over how students study. This is not always acceptable to many instructors\nwho believe in retaining greater control of their classes. In the academic community, some\nof these perceptions are deeply ingrained and very resistant to change. Much of this\nresistance, especially towards new delivery technologies, can also be attributed to a lack\nof confidence on the part of instructors in their abilities, and a fear of having to learn a\nnew skill. A CMC-based instructional delivery system poses this kind of threat to most\ninstructors, especially those who have little or no proficiency in working with students\nonline.\nOur experience tells us that these are serious considerations that must be carefully\nplanned for. Instructors have to be introduced to the radical shift in the mindset or\norientation towards their teaching function in a CMC-based environment. Unless this\nshift in their mindset has taken place, success is far from certain.\nImplications for the learner\nStudents, also, hold particular conceptions and a mindset about their own roles as\nlearners and that of their instructors. Like instructors, they need to understand that a\nCMC-based teaching-learning environment shifts the bulk of the responsibility for\nlearning onto themselves. This requires recognition of that responsibility on their part,\nand the assumption of an active role in the learning process. Students must understand\nthat the instructor is no longer going to drive the learning for them, that they must learn\nto drive it for themselves.\nImportance of front-end training\nWhile an increasing number of the current generation of students are computer- and\nInternet-literate, there are still many among them who have no or only negligible\nexperience with computers and electronic networks. Experience derived from this project\nsuggests that a carefully planned front-end training is imperative for both students and\ninstructors involved in any CMC-based teaching-learning arrangement. Such a training\nprogram must be based on a thorough assessment of the needs of the participants. It is\nlikely that these needs will be variable which would then necessitate individualized or\nsmall-group attention for particular or all aspects of the training. Yet while front-end\ntraining is a must, it is also certain that training up-front in the use of CMC will be\ninsufficient. Training and continuing assistance will be necessary throughout the duration\nof such a project. Therefore, help with online instruction and the equipment will need to\nbe available on a continual basis, either online or otherwise.\nOutcomes of CMC-based instruction\nA CMC-based instructional environment is fundamentally different from the\nconventional classroom-based system in very many ways. The difference between the two\nmodes of instruction is most explicit in the manner in which content is delivered to the\nlearner, the communication patterns between tutors and students and among the students\nthemselves, the manner in which students access additional learning resources, and the\nmanner in which assessment of learning is carried out. Most instructors who have been\nexposed to a CMC-based instructional system argue, although not initially, that the mode\nhas had a significant and lasting impact on their overall approach to teaching and\n71\nSom Naidu et at Improving instructional effectiveness wirh computer-mediated communication\nlearning. Our experience suggests that this kind of an impact is manifested in several\nways. Some of the more visible ones are discussed in the following sections of the paper.\nExpanded resource base\nCurrently, the integration of CMC in instructional systems may include any one or more\nof a growing number of applications. These include access to electronic mail, bulletin\nboards, databases, networked CD-ROMs, network newsgroups, electronic discussion lists\nand computer conferences, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) facilities, and global search tools\nsuch as Gopher, Telnet, Knowboots, Netfind, Finger, and Archie. This list tends to be\nexpanding all the time. With the help of an average personal computer and a\ncommunication connection, these applications have the potential of bringing to the\nlearners an expanded learning-resource base which would be otherwise beyond their\nreach. The learning resources that these applications can bring to the learners include,\ninter alia, libraries and other sources of information at remote sites, access to inter-\nnational experts and research sites, other students, colleagues and peers, and access to\nrelevant discussions that might be taking place in other parts of the world.\nOur experience and those of others (Ferris and Roberts, 1994) show that access to an\nexpanded learning resource base that is carefully selected can mean that learners are not\nonly encountering more useful material than that specified in the curriculum, they are also\ncovering the specified content and more material more rapidly than is possible in\nconventional systems. Learners shift from being passive receptacles to being active\nparticipants in the search for knowledge. Moreover, they learn how to acquire and use\nknowledge, and instructor-roles shift from dispensers of information to producers of\nenvironments which allow learners to learn as much as is possible on given topics.\nCo-operative learning environment\nConventionally, co-operative learning refers to instructional and learning environments\nwhich are characterized by increased interactions among individual learners or among\nsmall groups of learners. This form of learning has its limitations no doubt, but its\npositive contributions to learning and instructional outcomes are reported to far outweigh\nits limitations or difficulties (Johnson and Johnson, 1984). A computer-mediated learning\nand teaching environment which depends upon interaction between databases,\ninstructors, tutors and students, and also among students, is by definition a co-operative\none. Computer-mediated co-operative learning and teaching has been shown to enhance\nlearning outcomes in many different ways, including improvement in the quantity and\nquality of the learning experience (see Collis, in press).\nComputer-supported co-operative instruction is also reported to have benefited the\ninstructors. Ferris and Roberts (1994) report that as a result of the experience in the use\nof CMC in their instructional environments, instructors began to take a larger and more\nsystems-oriented perspective of their contributions in the school, meeting each week in\nteams to plan an integrated effort. Problems that arose were dealt with by the teams\nrather than by the one instructor in the conventional system. Almost subconsciously, the\nroles of instructors in their classrooms got transformed into a more collaborative one.\nAuthentic learning environment\nA computer-mediated learning and instructional environment is capable of reaching out\nto resources in remote locations, including people and sites, for relevant information that\n\u2014\nALT-) Volume 3 Number 2\nwould otherwise be impossible to access by most students in the time that is usually\navailable to them. As such, a CMC-based instructional system is capable of facilitating\n'authentic' learning by enabling access to environments separated in time and place from\none's home base. Realities can be created, in cyberspace in a manner of speaking, by\nelectronic access to people in situ in different countries, cultures, systems and with access\nto libraries, databases and also discussions raging on the Internet.\nAuthentic assessment environment\nSimilarly, a CMC-based instructional environment is potentially capable of an assessment\nsystem that is authentic and dynamic in nature. Assessment can be authentic in the sense\nthat it is situated and contextualized rather than contrived. It can be dynamic in that\nassessment is continuous and pegged to what students are doing in terms of their\ninteractions and activities online. A variety of instructional strategies are open to\ninstructors in CMC-based instructional systems such as setting up discussions, debates,\ntasks, project work etc. to which students are required to contribute. These contributions\nare asynchronous, and can be assessed by the instructor on an individual basis, including\nthe provision of individualized as well as group feedback.\nFlexible learning\nFlexibility is a characteristic feature of a CMC-based learning and instructional\nenvironment. The integration of some form of CMC in teaching and\/or learning means\nthat the communication channels between the instructor and the students, and among the\nstudents, are not only open all the time, but asynchronous. With communication channels\nopen, teachers and students have access to one another at any time of the day rather than\nwaiting for the lecture, tutorial or consultation times to raise a query or share some\ninteresting thought as these are occurring in the process of one's study. Messages,\nquestions and contributions by students or teachers can be left on the network\nasynchronously, meaning at different times and from different locations. Open and\nasynchronous communications between the instructor and the students are the hallmarks\nof a flexible learning arrangement.\nA CMC-based learning and instructional system is open also in terms of the many\ninstructional strategies it can accommodate., These include individual searches of online\ndatabases, journals, libraries, and discussion groups. One-to-one communication may\ntake the form of correspondence study, learning contracts, apprenticeships, and\ninternships between the instructor-student, the student-expert, and also between students.\nOne-to-many online communication may include lectures, symposiums, and panel\ndiscussions. Many-to-many techniques can include debates, simulations\/games, role\nplays, case studies, discussions, project-based work, brainstorming, delphi and nominal\ngroup techniques, forums, and cognitive networking\/mapping. This list of online activities\nis by no means exhaustive. It is an indication of what is possible in a CMC-based\ninstructional environment with a little bit of imagination and creativity, mostly as part of\ninstructional design and development.\nLearning skills development\nA CMC-based learning environment places the responsibility for learning more than ever\nin the hands of the learner. In so doing, the learner is greatly empowered, and also placed\nin a position of greater control of not only the amount but the quality of his or her\n73\nSom Naidu et al Improving instructional effectiveness wirti computer-mediated communication\nlearning. This autonomy allows learners (especially the enterprising ones) to explore,\nexperiment, take risks and venture beyond that which is necessary. A natural outcome of\nthis kind of initiative on the part of learners is enhanced learning skills relating to the\nsearch for and acquisition of knowledge. In conventional systems of instruction, much of\nthis kind of autonomy is not possible due to a greater degree of instructor-control of\nlearning, and also because of the lack of resources in the learners' immediate learning\nenvironment. With the help of CMC, that learning environment is now much larger and\nmore accessible, allowing for a richer and larger resource base for the learners as well as\nthe instructors.\nConcluding comment\nThis project was implemented to ascertain, inter alia, factors that needed addressing when\nbuilding a CMC-based learning and instructional delivery system. It was evident, from\nour experience, that in the initial stages students as well as instructors require an intensive\ntraining program to familiarize them with basic operations such as logging on and the use\nof passwords, moving between applications, such as from Word to Mail, and how to save\nand store material for future reference. Many students and instructors are still locked into\nthe time and place concepts associated with lectures and tutorials. The issues of flexibility\nand openness must be carefully introduced to all stakeholders in such a project. Once\nfamiliar with this process of instruction and interaction, learners are able to work\nconsistently at their own pace, and realize that instructors and tutors are interested in\nevery individual learner's opinion and also in the collective views of the group. It is\nevident that a CMC-based instructional delivery system has the potential to facilitate that\noutcome as well as improve instructional effectiveness.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors are grateful to the Committee for Advancement of University Teaching\n(CAUT) for financial support in the conduct of this study.
