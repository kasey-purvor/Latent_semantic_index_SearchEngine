The system supports sharing, reuse and adaptation of learning material via\na metadata-driven philosophy that enables the technicalities of the system to be imperceptible\nto the author and consumer. The system proposes the use of pedagogically focused metadata to\nsupport and guide the author and to adapt and deliver the content to the targeted consumer. A\nprototype of the proposed system, which provides proof of concept for the novel processes\ninvolved, has been developed. The paper describes the Smart Learning Design Framework and\nplaces it within the context of alternative learning object models and frameworks to highlight\nsimilarities, differences and advantages of the proposed system.\nIntroduction\nMuch of the current focus in the e-learning arena is centred upon the development of\ntechnical infrastructures that support reusability, interoperability, durability and\naccessibility of learning content (Bannan-Ritland et al., 2002; Welsch, 2002; Hummel\net al., 2004). While much of this work has focused on the development of standards\nfor learning objects, significant effort is also being made to develop standard descrip-\ntions for aggregations of learning objects; for example, in the form of a course module.\nThe advantage of such an approach is that a module described using a standard spec-\nification could be transferred to any learning system able to interpret the standard,\n*Corresponding author. Telecommunications and Information Technology Research Institute,\nUniversity of Wollongong, Australia. Email: jasonl@elec.uow.edu.au\n152 J. Lukasiak et al.\nthus enabling greater interoperability. However, considerable differences exist in the\nover-riding philosophies of proposed techniques.\nThe Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM), which is becoming a\nde facto standard for delivering educational material (Olivier & Liber, 2003), is\nbased on the premise that learning content can be decomposed into discrete entities\nthat are context independent. These \u2018content objects\u2019 are then \u2018combined with other\ninstructional content objects, the aggregation provides the context and supports a\ndefined learning experience\u2019 (Advanced Distributed Learning, 2004, pp. 1\u201324).\nWhile SCORM claims to be \u2018pedagogically neutral\u2019 (Learning Systems Architecture\nLaboratory, 2003, p. 1) and thus capable of supporting many different instructional\ndesigns, it is based on a content-driven, individual, self-paced approach to learning\nwith a focus on tracking a learner\u2019s progress through the content (Kraan & Wilson,\n2002; Koper, 2003; Olivier & Liber, 2003). Thus SCORM provides the technical\ninfrastructure to facilitate the creation of reusable content, but does not prescribe or\noffer guidance to the author about how to produce effective content and sequence it\nin a way to produce pedagogically sound learning material (Pasini, 2004). This also\nimplies that experts such as instructional designers are needed when determining\nwhat objects constitute a unit of learning. In fact, the SCORM documentation\nsuggests that a development team is required to produce SCORM-compliant\ncontent (see Ip & Canale, 2003, p. 672; Learning Systems Architecture Laboratory,\n2003, pp. 13\u201314). Specifically, authors converting existing learning material to\nSCORM compliance must be able to structure the content in context-free objects,\nwhile those reusing existing SCORM objects must be able to aggregate those objects\ninto meaningful learning sequences (Learning Systems Architecture Laboratory,\n2003).\nThis approach may be suitable for large organisations that employ teams of special-\nist instructional designers, subject-matter experts, graphic designers and program-\nmers, and that are concerned mainly with self-paced, individual training. However, it\nseems unlikely to transfer well to the higher education sector in which a much wider\nrange of pedagogical approaches is used and teachers often design, develop and\nimplement an e-learning course single-handedly or in small teams without specialist\nassistance.\nAs an alternative to SCORM, the IMS Learning Design (LD) specification (IMS\nGlobal Learning Consortium, 2003) promises to address at least one of these issues.\nIMS LD places learning activity at the fore by recognising that learning does not\nequate to content consumption (Tattersall & Koper, 2003). It provides a language to\ndescribe a learning process, referred to as a \u2018unit of learning\u2019, in a standardised\nmachine-readable format. IMS LD draws on Educational Modelling Language and\nis intended, unlike SCORM, to describe a broad spectrum of pedagogies with support\nfor \u2018multiple learners as well as a single learner\u2019, \u2018behaviourist as well as constructivist\napproaches\u2019 and \u2018mixed mode (a mix of traditional and online learning, currently also\nreferred to as \u201cblended learning\u201d) as well as purely online learning\u2019 (Olivier & Liber,\n2003, p. 154). As such, IMS LD has the potential to describe a far greater array of\nlearning process than SCORM.\nLearning objects and learning designs 153\nHowever, authors adopting the IMS LD specification must still know how to\nstructure their educational material into pedagogically effective \u2018units of learning\u2019 to\ncreate lessons, modules or entire courses. Tools are emerging to make the design\nprocess easier as well as implementing the IMS LD specification; for example, Learn-\ning Activity Management System (Dalziel, 2003; LAMS, 2004) (based in part on\nIMS LD) and CopperCore.1 Although user-friendly authoring tools are an important\nstep (Hummel et al., 2004), they may not be sufficient to support teachers to create\neffective e-learning. This issue is already being experienced in higher education, with\nmany tertiary teachers facing significant challenges in developing effective online\nlearning experiences, even with the use of learning management systems (Bennett &\nLockyer, 2004).\nThe work described in this paper aims to address the lack of pedagogical support\ninherent in existing systems by providing a platform-independent data structure\nencapsulated in an integrated pedagogically centred authoring process. The proposed\nSmart Learning Design Framework (SLDF) is underpinned by considerations about\nhow higher education teachers would work with learning objects and the kinds of\nsupport they would need to create effective learning experiences. The SLDF utilises\nthe MPEG-21 (Bormans & Hill, 2002) standard for data structure, with author\nsupport implicit in the development of pedagogically sound content via the creation\nand use of meaningful metadata. The structure proposed for the SLDF supports\ncontent sharing, reuse, customisation and interoperability while integrating author\nsupport into a development process suitable for the single author in the higher educa-\ntion context. While SLDF offers a different perspective to the standard specifications\nalready discussed, this does not preclude backward compatibility with these stan-\ndards. In fact, while not presented with this emphasis in the following sections, SLDF\ncould be viewed as an enhancement layer for SCORM and IMS LD, with translation\nback to these formats possible. However, this translation would necessarily result in\nsome loss of SLDF functionality.\nThe paper is structured as follows. An overview of the proposed SLDF, in which\nits characteristics are highlighted and contrasted with alternative e-learning technical\nspecifications, is presented in the next section. The overview is then expanded by\nproviding a comprehensive description of the entire SLDF. The paper concludes by\nsummarising the proposed SLDF technique and presents avenues of future research.\nThe SLDF concept\nThe SLDF proposed in this paper extends the framework presented in Lukasiak\net al. (2005). The cornerstone of the SLDF is the seamless integration of a technical\ndata structure with a well-supported process for developing pedagogically sound e-\nlearning materials.\nThe technical data structure is based on the MPEG-21 multimedia framework\n(Bormans & Hill, 2002). MPEG-21 aims to provide a universal multimedia frame-\nwork that permits the use of multimedia across a wide range of platforms and systems.\nThe basic unit within the MPEG-21 framework is the Digital Item (DI). This is a\n154 J. Lukasiak et al.\n\u2018structured digital object with a standard representation, identification, and meta-\ndata\u2019 (Burnett et al., 2003). The DI is made up of three main components: resources,\nmetadata, and structure. DIs represent the unit of transaction within the MPEG-21\nstandard and are universally represented using XML (Burnett et al., 2003).\nEmploying a broader, universal technical specification, as opposed to more\nspecific learning technology specification (such as IMS), offers a number of\nadvantages. These advantages include: the ability to exploit generic infrastructure\n(such as gateways and repositories) designed for the broader standard, thus promot-\ning interoperability; the separation of content from presentation (as opposed to\nSCORM, which is HTML reliant), thus promoting reuse and customisation; and the\nability to adapt content delivery based upon user preferences and content metadata,\nthus promoting adaptation. A detailed description of the application of MPEG-21 to\ne-learning materials is provided in Lukasiak et al. (2005).\nThe SLDF authoring process is based on the notion that a learning design can\nprovide guidance for authors to create pedagogically sound learning material. A learn-\ning design refers to the way in which activities, resources and support mechanisms are\nplanned and sequenced for students (Oliver & Herrington, 2001). When described in\na generic way, a learning design can serve as a framework or template into which\nlearning objects and context-specific information can be incorporated (Bennett et al.,\n2004). Thus the learning design provides the pedagogical \u2018glue\u2019 to aggregate learning\nobjects.\nThe outcome of the authoring process is referred to as a \u2018unit of study\u2019. A unit of\nstudy may comprise a single activity, multiple activities, a lesson or module, or an\nentire subject or course. Thus, from a conceptual viewpoint, the SLDF would\nsupport authors in the following ways: \n\u25cf Offer guidance in the selection and adaptation of a learning design suitable to the\nauthor\u2019s (teacher\u2019s) educational context.\n\u25cf Assist with the selection and aggregation of suitable learning objects based on the\nchosen learning design.\n\u25cf Package the unit of study for delivery to the learner(s).\nThe aggregation of learning objects into a unit of study is represented by a hierarchical\nstructure in which learning objects are represented at the lowest level of the hierarchy.\nIn the SLDF hierarchy, a learning object is defined as a digital resource that represents\nthe smallest autonomous pedagogical unit that can be reused to support learning\nrelated to a specific purpose or intention (Agostinho et al., 2004; Lukasiak et al.,\n2005). Each learning object is represented as an MPEG-21 DI. This allows learning\nobjects to have individual metadata and rights2 protection, and also facilitates the\nsharing and storage of the learning objects in large educational repositories that\nsupport the broader MPEG-21 format.\nAt the next level in the hierarchy, multiple learning objects can be aggregated to\nform a unit of study. The unit of study is also represented as an MPEG-21 DI, which\nembeds the learning objects (themselves individual digital items) as resources. A unit\nof study can also embed another unit of study, and so on. This format permits each\nLearning objects and learning designs 155\nunit of study to have unique metadata and rights embedded, while retaining the rights\nand metadata of the included learning objects and units of study. This hierarchical\nstructure is represented in stages 1 and 2 of Figure 1, where the multiple MPEG-21\nlearning objects generated in stage 1 are embedded in the MPEG-21 unit of study of\nstage 2. A practical example of the hierarchical metadata structure and the retention\nof embedded metadata for individual learning objects within the SLDF is illustrated\nin a later section.\nFigure 1. Overview of the SLDF processA significant feature of the SLDF is that the metadata schemas employed at the\nlearning object and unit of study levels are different. The metadata schema at the\nlearning object level is based on the IEEE LTSC Standard for Learning Object\nMetadata (IEEE LOM), and in terms of pedagogical information describes only the\nlearning object\u2019s intended original use. Yet a teacher may use a learning object in a\ndifferent way for different learning settings. Thus, another metadata schema, referred\nto as the \u2018Unit of Study Metadata\u2019, is used at the unit of study level and describes how\nthe learning object is utilised within the context of the unit of study. This use of\nmetadata is different to other hierarchical methods such as SCORM and IMS LD\nwhere the same metadata schema (based on IEEE LOM) is employed at each level of\nFigure 1. Overview of the SLDF process\n156 J. Lukasiak et al.\nthe hierarchy (IMS Global Learning Consortium, 2003; Advanced Distributed\nLearning, 2004).\nTwo editing tools work together seamlessly to support the SLDF authoring process\nas represented in Figure 1. At any time the author can work with either the Unit of\nStudy (UOS) Editor or the Learning Object Editor.\nThe Learning Object Editor allows the author to select the pre-existing learning\nresources that will comprise the learning object. These are termed assets in Figure 1\nand may include multiple files. The Learning Object Editor then assists the author to\ngenerate suitable metadata. This results in a learning object that complies with the\nSLDF application profile. Subsequently, and transparently to the author, the learning\nobject editor creates an MPEG-21 DI that represents the object. The author can\ncreate metadata for learning objects prior to or during the development of a unit of\nstudy, or can import a learning object into the SLDF system that already has\nmetadata associated with it.\nThe UOS Editor first assists the author select an appropriate learning design, and\nthen guides him\/her through the process of adding appropriate learning objects and\ncontextual information specific to the unit of study. During this process the SLDF\nhas the potential to provide the author with detailed assistance, including pedagogi-\ncal guidance about the inclusion of appropriate objects, the design of activities and\nthe choice of learning supports. The author assistance is based upon interrogation\nand analysis of the metadata embedded in learning objects, combined with pedagog-\nical considerations specific to the learning design being employed. For example, it is\nenvisaged that when an author selects a particular learning object to be included in\nthe UOS, the UOS Editor examines the metadata associated with that learning\nobject and prompts the author as to whether the selected learning object meets the\npedagogical requirements of the learning design. However, as the embedded\nmetadata describes the learning object\u2019s intended original usage, the system only\nprompts the author as to an apparent mismatch with the author able to ignore the\nnotification if applicable. In this way the system makes meaningful use of the meta-\ndata but still allows the author to adapt the use of the learning object to his\/her\nparticular context. An example of how proof of concept for metadata based author\nassistance has been achieved for the prototype UOS Editor is detailed in a later\nsection.\nThe interrogation and intelligent use of metadata implies that the generation and\ninclusion of appropriate metadata, at both the learning object and unit of study levels,\nis central to the SLDF concept. This metadata-driven approach requires the\nmetadata employed at each stage to be unambiguous, reliable and descriptive. Thus,\nthe metadata should mostly rely on well-structured schemas and vocabularies, and\navoid large amounts of free text to ensure consistency of application. The approach\ntaken to design the learning object and unit of study metadata schemes is detailed in\nlater sections. The metadata-driven approach adopted in the SLDF contrasts with\nthe content-driven approach adopted by systems such as SCORM. In these content-\ndriven approaches, metadata is included only for descriptive purposes and is often\nonly useful in repository operations such as searching.\nLearning objects and learning designs 157\nWhile conceptually the Learning Object and UOS Editors are shown as different\nsystems in Figure 1, practically they form part of an integrated software system with\neach editor differing primarily by the metadata schemas that are included. Common\nto both Learning Object and UOS stages is the fact that the output data structure\ntakes the form of an MPEG-21 DI (Bormans & Hill, 2002). This characteristic\ndictates that the unit of transaction in the SLDF is the MPEG-21 DI.\nUsing the MPEG-21 DI allows the SLDF to provide simple and seamless cust-\nomisation of the content delivery. This is represented by the Delivery Stage (stage 3)\nin Figure 1, where templates are used to customise the content presentation.\nCustomisation is possible because MPEG-21 separates content from its presenta-\ntion (Bormans & Hill, 2002) and the SLDF exploits this characteristic by using\ntemplates to extract the required content presentation from the UOS DI prior to\nfinal content delivery. A simple example application of the flexibility inherent in this\nsystem would be delivering similar learning content to students enrolled in the same\nsubject at different locations. Employing the SLDF would allow an institution to\ngenerate a single SLDF UOS and customise the templates to meet the requirements\nfor the different locations. More sophisticated customisations are also possible; for\nexample, to students using different display devices or to suit different modes of\nteaching.\nThe subsequent three sections of this paper expand on the overview already\npresented and provide detailed explanation and discussion of each stage in Figure 1.\nLearning Objects in the SLDF\nDescription and structure\nAs described in the previous section, the SLDF software systems include a Learning\nObject Editor, which allows the seamless generation of MPEG-21 DIs that represent\nthe learning object and its metadata and rights. This tool promotes the inclusion of\npedagogically comprehensive and repeatable metadata via pull-down menus\ngenerated from an XML-based metadata schema. The metadata schema has been\ndesigned to restrict the use of free text and to instead employ fixed vocabularies for\nmany of the metadata fields (see next section for details of the metadata develop-\nment). Structuring the schema to minimise free text promotes metadata repeatability\nand facilitates machine-based operations such as efficient object retrieval from\nrepositories, automated adaptation of objects to meet requirements and intelligent\nauthor assistance when embedding objects into units of study. Also, utilising an\nXML-based schema to generate the pull-down menu fields allows the tool to be\nsimply modified, expanded or customised via the production of new metadata\nschemas or the inclusion of alternative metadata schemas.\nThe Learning Object Editor has also been designed to make the technical complex-\nities of the system imperceptible to the author, by automatically generating conform-\ning MPEG-21 DIs behind the scenes. The tool also parses the data via conforming\nXML schemas to generate the DIs. This allows the tool to be easily customised to\n158 J. Lukasiak et al.\ngenerate alternative data structures (such as SCORM) through the use of alternative\nXML schema files for data content.\nLearning Object metadata for higher education\nThe SLDF is premised on the notion that Learning Objects are resources that, if\nappropriately annotated with metadata, can be retrieved easily and incorporated into\na learning design. There has been considerable interest in the development of meta-\ndata schemas over the past decade, with two main initiatives being The Dublin Core\nMetadata Initiative3 and the IEEE LTSC Standard for Learning Object Metadata\n(IEEE, 2002). The learning object literature highlights that these metadata schemas,\nparticularly IEEE LOM, are being customised to meet the specific needs of commu-\nnities. The use of metadata application profiles\u2014where communities annotate their\nlearning objects in more specific ways, yet adhere to a metadata standard\u2019s overall\nstructure (e.g. incorporating specific vocabularies for certain metadata elements, and\ndeciding which metadata elements are mandatory and optional)\u2014is becoming\nprevalent. Thus, IEEE LOM was closely examined by reviewing critiques of LOM,\ndirectly applying the Educational category descriptors to a number of Learning\nObjects, and then examining a well-researched LOM-based application profile. The\napplication profile devised incorporates recommendations from CanCore (Friesen\net al., 2003) and includes specific vocabularies suitable for the Australian Higher\nEducation context. A detailed description of the development of the application\nprofile for higher education can be found in Agostinho et al. (2004).4\nExample\nThe screen capture shown in Figure 2 shows an image of a girl walking with ball in\nhand. The image is annotated with a directional arrow and the symbol X placed\ndirectly above a cup, which sits on the ground. The image is accompanied by text\ndescribing the girl as walking at a constant pace with ball in her hand. This image can\nbe considered a learning object because it has been created in this form specifically\nfor instructional purposes.\nFigure 2. Image of girl with a ball (Kearney & Wright, 2002)A screen capture of the Learning Object Editor in Figure 3 shows the metadata\nrecord being created for this learning object by the author.\nFigure 3. Creating a metadata record for the image of a girl with a ballThe Editor automatically generates fields such as resource location, MIME type and\nsize from the technical specifications of the selected file(s). Automated completion of\nthe title field is only treated as a suggestion and the author is free to replace the auto-\nmated value with a more descriptive title. The author\u2019s details can be stored as a user\nprofile in the application preferences and are automatically included in the Contributors\nfield, although this data can be altered if necessary. The majority of the remaining fields\nare specified by selecting the appropriate term from pull-down menus, with free text\nlimited to fields such as Title, Description, Keywords and Educational Use, and to specify\nusage restriction details. The author can access guidance about how to complete each\nmetadata field by clicking on the question mark icon associated with each field.\nLearning objects and learning designs 159\nThe application profile has been designed to provide detailed pedagogical informa-\ntion that can be used to inform the selection of learning objects when embedding them\ninto a UOS. This is achieved through the use of controlled vocabularies for the LOM\nelements 5.2 Learning Resource Type, 5.6 Context, and 5.7 Typical Age Range. These\nfields are represented in Figure 3 as, respectively: Type of learning resource (diagram,\nimage, scenario); Context of Use (university undergraduate); and Audience status\/age\n(first-year undergraduate). In specifying the type of learning resource for a Learning\nObject, the author selects appropriate values from the IEEE LOM vocabulary and\nthen chooses further values from an additional vocabulary specific to higher education\ndeveloped for this project. This additional vocabulary provides a richer set of options\nthat allows the author to clearly describe the form and function of the object. The\ncontrast between this additional vocabulary and the available LOM vocabulary for\nlearning resource type is evident in Figure 3 by examining the LOM and SLDF entries\nin the type of learning resource field. This example clearly demonstrates the improved\npedagogical description available via the inclusion of the SLDF vocabulary.\nUnit of study in the SLDF\nConcept and overview\nThe SLDF structure presents a seamless mechanism whereby learning objects and\nother units of study may be grouped together into a single unit of study, while still\nretaining the rights, metadata and functionality of the individual objects. This reten-\ntion of rights, metadata and functionality at each level creates a clear hierarchical\nFigure 2. Image of girl with a ball (Kearney & Wright, 2002)\n160 J. Lukasiak et al.\nstructure within which the complexity of the objects\/units of study increase as the\nlevel of the hierarchy increases. Also, the metadata becomes less objective (data-\nbased) and more subjective (context-based) as one progresses up the hierarchy. The\nunit of study metadata describes the pedagogical approach and sequence in which the\nembedded content is to be consumed, while learning object metadata (see previous\nsection) describes the specific content of the associated data.\nUOS metadata\nThere are calls from educators for richer metadata to describe how learning objects\nare used to create a learning experience; that is, how they are sequenced, aggregated\nand combined (Jonassen & Churchill, 2004). Current metadata initiatives are focused\nat the learning object level and there are no metadata schemas that describe how\nlearning objects are aggregated and used in a learning environment. As introduced\nearlier, the SLDF proposes to address this problem by employing different (pedagog-\nically distinct) metadata schemas at the Learning Object and UOS levels.\nThe SLDF UOS metadata provide information about the activity students are to\nperform and how the learning objects will be used to support them. The purpose of\nthe UOS metadata is twofold. It can be used in machine-readable format to inform\nFigure 3. Creating a metadata record for the image of a girl with a ball\nLearning objects and learning designs 161\nthe delivery of the unit of study, and can also be used to generate documentation for\nthe educator about the UOS in the form of a summary report\/course outline. This\nfunctionality contrasts with the IMS LD specification, which provides a language to\ndescribe a \u2018unit of learning\u2019, which is machine-readable and can be interpreted by an\nIMS LD aware player (Hummel et al., 2004). Unlike the UOS metadata, it is not\nintended that IMS LD be interpreted by the educator.\nThe UOS metadata schema has been designed to describe the tasks, resources and\nthe supports to be applied with the chosen learning design: the tasks being what\nstudents are required to do in the learning environment, the resources being provided\nto help students complete the tasks, and supports defined as the mechanisms to help\nthe students complete the tasks (Oliver & Herrington, 2001). The organisational\nstructure of the UOS metadata schema is similar to IEEE LOM, but the fields within\nthe categories have been tailored to provide description more relevant to the UOS,\nparticularly for the Educational category.\nExample\nAt present, proof of concept for the SLDF unit of study functionality has been\nachieved via the inclusion of a Predict\u2013Observe\u2013Explain (POE) learning design\n(Kearney & Wright, 2002) into the UOS Editor. It is envisaged that future enhance-\nments will allow multiple generic learning designs to be available via a pull-down\nmenu in the UOS Editor. The following demonstrates an example of the SLDF\nsystem applied to the POE learning design. The generic version of the POE learning\ndesign is graphically represented in Figure 4.\nFigure 4. POE Learning Design\nFigure 4. POE Learning Design\n162 J. Lukasiak et al.\nThe SLDF UOS Editor allows the author to specify learning objects and contex-\ntually specific information for a UOS based on this framework. As with the Learning\nObject Editor, the author can access detailed assistance by clicking on the question-\nmark buttons. For example, general information about the POE learning design (i.e.\nwhat tasks students are required to conduct, what resources are required to help\nwith the tasks and how students should be supported) is available by clicking on the\nquestion marks in Figure 4. A screen capture of the interface to develop a POE unit\nof study is shown in Figure 5.\nFigure 5. Screen capture of POE Learning Design interface in UOS EditorDetailed pedagogical guidance\u2014such as how to select an appropriate scenario,\nwhat learning objects to include, how the prediction question and multiple-choice\noptions should be structured\u2014is provided, again via clicking on the question-mark\nbuttons. An example of this pedagogical support is illustrated in Figure 6.\nFigure 6. Example of pedagogical support provided by the UOS Editor when designing a POE UOS\nFigure 5. Screen capture of POE Learning Design interface in UOS Editor\nLearning objects and learning designs 163\nWhen a generic learning design is chosen, the UOS metadata record is created and\nsome values can be automatically generated. These generic values can be used to\nsupport the authoring process. For example, the learning design detailed in Figure 4\nrequires that a multimedia representation of a scenario be included. Thus, when a\nlearning object is selected for inclusion, the embedded learning object metadata is\ninterrogated. If the learning object shown in Figure 3 is selected for inclusion in the\nPOE UOS, the values associated with 5.2 Learning Resource Type are checked to see\nif they match the pedagogical requirements of the learning design (in this instance,\nthe prototype checks that the learning resource type defines a multimedia representa-\ntion, as required for the POE learning design). If there is a mismatch, the author is\nnotified and can decide whether to include the learning object or select another.\nTable 1 presents the form of the UOS metadata. The table includes the educational\ndescriptors, with example values specified for the prediction task, which uses the\nimage resource shown in Figure 2 and support for peer discussion. Controlled\nvocabularies are used to accompany the use of free text fields. In this way, the UOS\nmetadata can be interrogated both by a teacher and the system. Work is currently\nunderway to refine the UOS metadata schema.\nFigure 6. Example of pedagogical support provided by the UOS Editor when designing a POE UOS\n164 J.

This is certainly the constraint of systems such as SCORM (Advanced\nDistributed Learning, 2004) in that employing HTML as the data structure intro-\nduces an implicit limitation that content and presentation are inseparably linked. This\nlinkage of content and presentation introduces considerable restriction when custom-\nising the presentation of content for various audiences. The SLDF removes this\nconstraint by operating within the MPEG-21 standard, thus the unit of transaction\nwithin the SLDF is the MPEG-21 DI. MPEG-21 employs an XML-based data format\nthat has been intentionally selected to separate the data content from its presentation.\nThe SLDF supports explicit flexibility in content presentation via the application\nof templates to the UOS at the point of delivery. Due to their versatility and universal\nformat, XSLT style sheets have been chosen as the format for representing the SLDF\ntemplates. The process of flexibly presenting an SLDF unit of study, represented in\nstage 3 of Figure 1, shows the same UOS being used to generate different presenta-\ntion formats via the application of different templates. The prototype UOS currently\nsupports templates that permit delivery of the POE unit of study as either a webpage\nor a subject overview\/handout. It is the vision of the SLDF that a range of templates\nfor each learning design be available within the UOS Editor. These templates will\nsupport common standard formats, such as HTML and PDF. It is envisaged that\nauthors will be able to customise the presentation of their content by editing the\nstandard templates, producing their own templates or importing existing templates.\nFigure 7 represents a possible scenario in which the example UOS for a higher\neducation course can be presented in two distinct formats. The right-hand presenta-\ntion represents a text-based handout, while the left-hand presentation constitutes a\nwebsite that delivers course content such as images, video and learner interaction via\nform fields. In this example, the SLDF uses the unit of study to produce both\ninstances using appropriate templates to extract the data into the required presenta-\ntion format. The distinct advantage is that the author only produces a single unit of\nstudy. Traditionally, such an example would require the author to generate the two\nforms of learning content themselves.\nFigure 7. Example of adaptive content presentationWhile not readily apparent in Figure 7, there is also inherent flexibility in the deliv-\nery method for SLDF content. For example, the template extraction process could\nbe server based, user based or performed prior to transmission. In a server-based\nscenario, the UOS DI would be transmitted directly to an MPEG-21-compliant\nserver. The remote server would then process the unit of study and deliver the\nappropriate presentation to the end users, based on student and system metadata (or\npreferences). For example, a student accessing the course over a handheld computer\nmay not have the infrastructure necessary to display the full HTML presentation. In\nthis situation the MPEG-21-compliant server could detect the display device via user\ndescriptors and deliver only a visually restricted version of the unit, such as a text-\nbased subject information sheet. This scenario provides a practical example of the DI\nadaptation philosophy detailed in Vetro et al. (2002) and Vetro and Timmerer\n166 J. Lukasiak et al.\n(2005), and presents another potential advantage of using a universal technical spec-\nification for delivering learning content.\nA user-based scenario would see the unit of study DI being delivered directly to all\nend users. The users could then apply their own templates to extract the presentation\nthat they currently require. Alternatively, the required presentation could be centrally\nextracted from the unit of study DI prior to any transmission and then delivered\ndirectly to the remote users via a company intranet.\nAn alternative to producing a customised presentation from the SLDF unit of\nstudy via a template is to simply use any MPEG-21-compliant browser to view the\ncontents. Currently, a free MPEG-21 browser is available from Enikos.5 While\nemploying a universal MPEG-21 browser to view the unit of study would limit the\nfunctionality and adaptability of the presentation, it does signify another advantage of\nworking within a universal technical standard, in that universal players and browsers\nshould be freely available.\nConclusions and further work\nThe proposed SLDF represents an integrated system developed to support the trans-\nparent authoring of pedagogically sound educational material. The system addresses\nissues of platform independence, data transparency and adaptation by operating\nFigure 7. Example of adaptive content presentation\nLearning objects and learning designs 167\nwithin the MPEG-21 framework. In addition, object sharing, reuse and repeatability\nare addressed through the inclusion of well-defined metadata.\nAs opposed to other systems, such as SCORM, the proposed system is centred on\ndeveloping pedagogically sound learning material. Pedagogical support is provided\nvia the integration of learning designs and pedagogically descriptive metadata into the\nauthoring process. A novel hierarchy of metadata is utilised whereby UOSs, which are\nhighly context focused, are described with metadata different to learning objects,\nwhich have far less context and are more content orientated.\nThe primary advantages of the SLDF system can be summarised as follows: \n\u25cf Guidance and support for the development of appropriate learning context and\npedagogy is implicit in the system.\n\u25cf Assistance with the selection and aggregation of suitable learning objects based on\nthe chosen learning design is possible via interrogation of the metadata included in\nthe selected learning objects.\n\u25cf It represents an integrated metadata-driven system where pedagogical soundness\nand technical transparency are implicit.\n\u25cf Technical complexities such as data structure and programming are transparent to\nthe author. At no stage in the process is the author aware (or required to be aware)\nof the fact that the learning material being developed is packaged as data units\nconforming to the MPEG-21 standard.\n\u25cf Learning objects are assembled into digital items that exhibit a transparent data\nformat and facilitate storage, adaptation and reuse (i.e. use in online repositories).\n\u25cf Meaningful metadata (description) is included at both the Learning Object and\nUOS levels. This metadata supports both reuse by other authors and provides\nobjective targets for adaptation and customised delivery.\n\u25cf Data are separated from presentation, which in turn supports seamless and simple\ncustomisation of presentation via templates.\n\u25cf It scales from a complex design paradigm employing educational designers,\ninstructional designers, artists and programmers to a single author in an unsup-\nported environment such as higher education.\nCurrent work involves a practical evaluation of the usability and usefulness of the\nSLDF in a real educational setting. This work involves a test group of 12 secondary\nteachers. Avenues for future work include: refinement of the metadata schemas\nutilised at both Learning Object and UOS levels; development of repositories suit-\nable for storing, searching and retrieving the proposed learning objects; refinement of\nthe template process used for content presentation; integration of the proposed\nsystem into existing learning management systems; and compatibility with existing\neducational technology standards.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Smart Internet Technology\nCooperative Research Centre (http:\/\/www.smartinternet.com.au) that has funded\n168 J.
