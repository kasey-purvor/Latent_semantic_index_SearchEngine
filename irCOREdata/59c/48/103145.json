Introduction\nThere has been much study of the evolution of passive scalars in \ufb02uid \ufb02ows.\nIn some cases, chosen either for mathematical convenience or with a certain\napplication in mind, the \ufb02uid \ufb02ow is taken to be kinematic while in other instances\nit is obtained dynamically through full simulation of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.\nProblems involving active scalars, in which the scalar feeds back on the \ufb02ow \ufb01eld,\nare much less well understood. In particular, within two-dimensional \ufb02uid \ufb02ows the\n\u2020 Present address: Environment and Technology, University of Brighton, Lewes Road, Brighton\nBN2 4GJ, UK.\n\u2021 Email address for correspondence: A.D.Gilbert@exeter.ac.uk\n50 M. R. Turner, A. P. Bassom and A. D. Gilbert\nvorticity becomes a scalar which is subject to mixing by the underlying \ufb02uid \ufb02ow, but\nat the same time it speci\ufb01es the \ufb02ow. It is then a subtle interaction of \ufb02uid stability\nand mixing properties that determines the evolution of such systems.\nHere the aim is to study this interaction and the subsequent di\ufb00usive evolution\nin a simple two-dimensional geometry which is broadly relevant to geophysical\napplications. Our chosen model is a coherent vortex in an external irrotational\n\ufb02ow \ufb01eld, such as might be generated by the motion of other coherent vortices in\ntwo-dimensional turbulence, or by the motion of boundaries. If a two-dimensional\nvortex, for simplicity say a Gaussian vortex, is subjected to a short period of weak\nspatially uniform external strain, the e\ufb00ect is to distort the vortex and generate a\nspiral structure of vorticity pulled out by the di\ufb00erential rotation of the vortex. This\nis a mode with azimuthal wavenumber m=2, and enstrophy, which is inviscidly\nconserved, is transferred from the mean to the mode. This process was studied in\ndetail by Bassom & Gilbert (1998, 1999) who identi\ufb01ed a number of distinct regimes.\nFirst is a dynamical feedback (or \u2018rebound\u2019) whereby the enstrophy transfers from the\nm=2 mode to the mean: the core of the vortex dynamically returns to axisymmetry, so\nsuppressing the generation of \ufb02uctuations and mixing there. Although this behaviour\nwas noted by Bassom & Gilbert (1998, 1999), it was not until the work of Schecter\net al. (2000) and Balmforth, Llewellyn Smith & Young (2001) that it could be claimed\nto be well understood. These latter authors used an asymptotic model to link the\nsuppression of \ufb02uctuations to the existence of a so-called \u2018quasi-mode\u2019 in the vortex.\nProperties of quasi-modes are a combination of those of continuous spectrum with\nothers of a normal mode, including an exponential decay rate or Landau pole, \ufb01rst\ndiscussed in the \ufb02uid context by Briggs, Daugherty & Levy (1970) and more recently\nin general boundary layer \ufb02ows by Shrira & Sazonov (2001).\nLeaving aside the technicalities of quasi-modes, the key point is that there is a\ndynamical response of the vortex which has the e\ufb00ect of suppressing mixing in the\ncore of the vortex. In many ways the core of the vortex has a damped \u2018elastic\u2019\nresponse, as we discuss further below, which is a function of the vorticity pro\ufb01le.\nHowever the behaviour of the external strain is itself to modify the pro\ufb01le, and\nchange the response to future strain. This can be studied in a deterministic context\nby applying strain \ufb01elds, and mapping out the dynamical response and the resulting\nmodi\ufb01ed pro\ufb01les: papers that discuss this include Balmforth et al. (2001) and Turner\n& Gilbert (2007, 2009). In the present work the intention is to determine the e\ufb00ect\nof a continuous external forcing, so that the vortex spreads and evolves, changing\nits response as it does so. If the external strain is weak, the spreading occurs on a\nslow time scale, and the response at any instant is given by a problem which is a\nlinearization about the pro\ufb01le at that time. If the external forcing is also random,\nwith a given correlation function, a weakly nonlinear theory can be used to derive a\ndi\ufb00usion equation that governs the spread of the vortex. Since this spreading involves\nthe response of the vortex to each frequency in the external strain, and each response\ndepends on the whole pro\ufb01le, the di\ufb00usion equation on the long time scale is both\nnonlinear and non-local. Although it cannot be written down in an explicit form, it\nmay be simulated numerically and its properties explored.\nIn the coming section we investigate the particular case of a Gaussian vortex\nplaced in a random strain \ufb01eld: our computations demonstrate the suppressed\ndi\ufb00usion in the core and the enhanced mixing further out in the tails, together\nwith a number of other phenomena including the formation of vorticity staircases,\nwith steps and transport barriers. To con\ufb01rm these \ufb01ndings, and to obtain more detail\nand greater understanding of our results, we then consider the system of equations in\nRandomly strained two-dimensional vortices 51\nBalmforth et al. (2001). These equations model the interaction of a normal mode\nriding on a compact central vortex, with a surrounding \u2018skirt\u2019 of weak vorticity. This\nis a good qualitative model of a Gaussian vortex and we \ufb01nd similar phenomena as\nfor the Gaussian case.\nA number of other studies have focused on the interaction of the dynamical\ne\ufb00ects of vorticity and the mixing properties of the \ufb02ow within a deterministic\nsetting. Haynes, Poet & Shuckburgh (2007) compare the transport in a kinematically\nprescribed \ufb02ow modelling a meandering jet, with a similar \ufb02ow on a beta plane under\ntopographic forcing. In both cases the presence of barriers inhibits mixing: however\nin the dynamical case there are signi\ufb01cant changes in the \ufb02ow \ufb01eld when a barrier is\nbroken and vorticity is homogenized in a large area of the \ufb02ow. Perhaps the closest\nstudies to the present paper are del Castillo Negrete (2000a,b): these papers consider\na variety of models in which advected scalars change the parameters of the \ufb02ow, or\na mapping such as the standard map (see also Bo\ufb00etta et al. 2003). In the model\nclosest to ours, the \u2018single wave model\u2019, vorticity is advected by a shear \ufb02ow whose\npro\ufb01le is chosen so that it possesses a neutral large-scale mode. The mode amplitude\ninteracts with the vorticity distribution to give a simpli\ufb01ed system similar to that\nderived by Balmforth et al. (2001). The presence of the neutral mode means that the\n\ufb02ow tends to develop a critical layer containing cat\u2019s eyes and the mixing of vorticity\nwithin these eyes can have a strong e\ufb00ect on the \ufb02ow \ufb01eld: for example introducing\nweak vorticity into the eyes can lead to resonant oscillations and enhanced mixing\n(del Castillo Negrete 2000a).\nThe process of vorticity mixing in the presence of a neutral mode (del Castillo\nNegrete 2000a,b) is very relevant to our study of a Gaussian vortex, even though this\npro\ufb01le possesses no neutral modes (Briggs et al. 1970). The reason is that, in a sense\nwe will explain, the Gaussian vortex \u2018nearly\u2019 has a neutral mode. This is the approach\ntaken in Balmforth et al. (2001), who break a Gaussian vortex into a compact coherent\ncore, for example a top-hat or Rankine vortex, surrounded by a tail or skirt of weak\nvorticity. A Rankine vortex supports a neutral m=2 normal mode (or Kelvin wave).\nThis is undamped, but if a weak vorticity gradient is introduced at the radius where\n\ufb02uid particles corotate with the wave, i.e. in the critical layer, Balmforth et al. (2001)\nshow how this can stabilize or destabilize the wave, depending on the sign of the\ngradient. In a similar way, for qualitative purposes a Gaussian vortex can be treated\nas having a core that supports a neutral mode, but which is damped by vorticity\nat the outer edges of the vortex: this combination forms a quasi-mode in the linear\nregime giving the damped elastic behaviour mentioned above. If pushed hard enough\ncat\u2019s eyes are created in the critical layer, with a pro\ufb01le modi\ufb01ed su\ufb03ciently for a true\nneutral normal mode to exist on the vortex (Balmforth et al. 2001; Turner & Gilbert\n2007).\nThese earlier studies have focused on the initial value problem, with linear behaviour\nsuch as quasi-mode damping, and the nonlinear generation of cat\u2019s eyes beyond some\namplitude threshold. Our study here is distinguished by using a weak random external\nforcing so that the vortex is always in a linear regime, and by using a weakly nonlinear\nexpansion to set up a di\ufb00usion equation for the vorticity pro\ufb01le on a long time scale.\nA related study was presented by two of the present authors a decade ago (Bassom\n& Gilbert 1999). There we again derived a weakly nonlinear system for the evolution\nof the mean pro\ufb01le, and proceded to simulate it with a realization of the random\nforcing included explicitly. Although some results were obtained, for example the\ndemonstration that the suppression of vorticity arising from the quasi-mode has the\ne\ufb00ect of decreasing the spread of the vortex compared to a passive scalar, it was\n52 M. R. Turner, A. P. Bassom and A. D. Gilbert\nnot possible to follow the system very far in time. The present study, which can be\nconsidered a more advanced version of Bassom & Gilbert (1999), as the random\ncomponent is ensemble averaged at the outset, will highlight some of the limitations\nof that earlier work, in particular our present \ufb01nding that the interaction of dynamical\nand di\ufb00usive properties of vorticity in these systems leads to small-scale instability\nand the generation of \ufb01ne scale steps in the vorticity pro\ufb01les.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In \u00a7 2 we consider the case of\nthe Gaussian vortex in a random strain \ufb01eld: a di\ufb00usion equation is derived for the\nevolution of the pro\ufb01le on a long time scale and numerical experiments are performed.\nWe attempt to throw more light on the processes involved by examining the model\nof Balmforth et al. (2001) in \u00a7 3. In these sections theory is developed, followed by\nnumerical simulations, but technical details are relegated to three appendices. Finally,\n\u00a7 4 o\ufb00ers some concluding discussion.\n2. Gaussian vortex in random strain\n2.1. Analytical development\nWe use the equations for inviscid planar \ufb02ow written in the form\n\u2202t\u03c9 = J (\u03c8,\u03c9), \u03c9 = \u2212\u22072\u03c8, (2.1)\nwith the velocity \ufb01eld u =(r\u22121\u2202\u03b8\u03c8,\u2212\u2202r\u03c8) in plane polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) and\nrJ (a, b) \u2261 (\u2202ra)(\u2202\u03b8b) \u2212 (\u2202\u03b8a)(\u2202rb).\nWe begin with an axisymmetric vortex, and adopt non-dimensional units based on\nits width and circulation. For example, our initial condition of a Gaussian vortex is\n\u03c9 = \u03c9 = (4\u03c0)\u22121e\u2212r\n2\/4, (2.2)\nwhere \u03c9 is the mean vorticity pro\ufb01le, averaged over \u03b8 . With a general vorticity pro\ufb01le\nis an associated mean stream function \u03c8 , angular velocity \u03b1 and vorticity gradient r\u03b2\ngiven by\n\u03c9 = \u2212r\u22121\u2202r (r\u2202r\u03c8), \u03b1 = \u2212r\u22121\u2202r\u03c8, \u03b2 = r\u22121\u2202r\u03c9. (2.3)\nWe now impose a weak, external strain \ufb01eld on the vortex by requiring that\n\u03c8(r, \u03b8, t) \u223c (\u22122\u03c0)\u22121 log r + \u03b5q(t)rmeim\u03b8 + c. c. (r \u2192 \u221e), (2.4)\nwhere c.c. denotes the complex conjugate. This is the monopolar \ufb01eld from the vortex\nplus the e\u00b1im\u03b8 components of a general multipolar \ufb01eld of complex amplitude \u03b5q(t)\nwith 0<\u03b5 \b 1. The resulting \ufb02ow is irrotational outside the vortex, at radii where \u03c9 is\ne\ufb00ectively zero. We will focus on the case m=2 numerically, that of spatially uniform\nexternal strain, but leave the general value of m in the mathematical development for\nclarity. (We note that m=1 gives a translation, while we expect mixing properties for\nmodes m> 2 to be similar to m=2.)\nThe time dependence of the statistically stationary external \ufb02ow is given by the\ncorrelation function of q(t) and we shall consider two cases. The \ufb01rst of these is a\n\ufb02ow that is delta correlated in time so that\n\u3008q(t)q\u2217(t \u2032)\u3009 = \u03b4(t \u2212 t \u2032), w(p) = 1. (2.5)\nHere the brackets \u3008\u00b7\u3009 denote an ensemble average and w(p) is a corresponding weight\nfunction which we note here for reference and which emerges in computing the\nfeedback on the mean pro\ufb01le in Appendix A. Physically, this function w(p) describes\nRandomly strained two-dimensional vortices 53\nthe contribution to frequency p from the random function q(t). Our second example\nhas a peak at a rotational frequency b and an exponential fall-o\ufb00\n\u3008q(t)q\u2217(t \u2032)\u3009 = a\n2\ne\u2212a|t\u2212t\n\u2032 | e\u2212imb(t\u2212t\n\u2032), w(p) =\na2\n(p \u2212 mb)2 + a2 , (2.6)\nso that the weight is largest around frequencies p=mb. The delta correlated case is\nrecaptured in the limit a \u2192 \u221e for any \ufb01xed b.\nNow consider the evolution of the \ufb02ow and vorticity \ufb01eld, for example starting from\nthe Gaussian initial condition (2.2). As time proceeds so the external \ufb02ow generates\n\ufb02uctuations, i.e. components proportional to e\u00b1im\u03b8 in the vorticity \ufb01eld. For small \u03b5\nthese are weak and governed by the equation for vorticity, linearized about the mean\npro\ufb01le \u03c9. There is then a feedback, of magnitude \u03b52, from the quadratic terms, which\nleads to a slow drift of the mean pro\ufb01le \u03c9, on a long time scale.\nTo obtain the equation for this drift, we begin by taking \u03b5 \b 1 in the external\nstrain (2.4), and introduce a long time scale \u03c4 = \u03b52t together with a weakly nonlinear\nexpansion\n\u03c9(r, t, \u03c4 ) = \u03c9(r, \u03c4 ) + \u03b5\u03c9\u02c6(r, t, \u03c4 )eim\u03b8 + c. c.+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (2.7)\n\u03c8(r, t, \u03c4 ) = \u03c8(r, \u03c4 ) + \u03b5\u03c8\u02c6(r, t, \u03c4 )eim\u03b8 + c. c.+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (2.8)\nDropping the hats yields equations for the \ufb02uctuating vorticity and stream function\n\u2202t\u03c9 + im\u03b1\u03c9 + im\u03b2\u03c8 = 0, \u2212\u03c9 = (\u22022r + r\u22121\u2202r \u2212 r\u22122m2)\u03c8. (2.9)\nThese evolve in the angular velocity \ufb01eld and background vorticity gradient given in\n(2.3) in terms of the mean pro\ufb01le. On the longer, \u03c4 time scale, the mean pro\ufb01le obeys\n\u2202\u03c4\u03c9 + r\n\u22121\u2202r (rF ) = 0, F = 2mr\u22121 Im\u3008\u03c9\u03c8\u2217\u3009, (2.10)\nwhere the angled brackets denote an ensemble average over realizations of the random\nforcing, and also an average over evolution on the fast t time scale.\nOur aim is to solve the \ufb02uctuating problem and then derive the feedback on the\nmean pro\ufb01le, in a form suitable for numerical time stepping. We use a Laplace\ntransform approach and de\ufb01ne\nf\u02dc (p) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndt eiptf (t), f (t) = \u2212 1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\n\u0393\ndp e\u2212ipt f\u02dc (p). (2.11)\nHere \u0393 is a contour taken from +\u221e to \u2212\u221e above all singularities of the function\nf\u02dc (p). From (2.9), in Laplace transform space we have to solve\n\u03c9\u02dc \u2261 \u2212(\u22022r + r\u22121\u2202r \u2212 r\u22122m2)\u03c8\u02dc = \u03b2(r)p\/m \u2212 \u03b1(r) \u03c8\u02dc (2.12)\nfor \u03c8\u02dc(r, p) with\n\u03c8\u02dc(r, p) \u223c rmq\u02dc(p) as r \u2192 \u221e (2.13)\nand \u03c8\u02dc(0, p)= 0. We formally write the solution as\n\u03c8\u02dc(r, p) = M(r, p)q\u02dc(p), \u03c9\u02dc(r, p) = N(r, p)q\u02dc(p). (2.14)\nAs discussed by Briggs et al. 1970, there is a singularity whenever the external\nfrequency p=m\u03b1(r) for some resonant radius r and the behaviour near such points\nis relevant to us.\n54 M. R. Turner, A. P. Bassom and A. D. Gilbert\nSuppose we consider a \ufb01xed value p=m\u03b1(s) for some s, and vary r; then the\nsolution to the above di\ufb00erential system has the following behaviour as r \u2192 s. The\nleading order singular term for the vorticity is a simple pole\nN(r, p) = \u2212C(p)\u03bc(s)(r \u2212 s)\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (2.15)\nand for the stream function is\nM(r, p) = C(p)[1 + \u03bc(s)(r \u2212 s) log(s \u2212 r) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ] + D(p)[(r \u2212 s) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ], (2.16)\nfor r < s, while\nM(r, p) = C(p)[1 + \u03bc(s)(r \u2212 s)(log(r \u2212 s) + i\u03c7) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ] + D(p)[(r \u2212 s) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ] (2.17)\nfor r > s. The coe\ufb03cients C and D depend on p and are \ufb01xed by the boundary\nconditions at r =0 and in\ufb01nity. The quantity \u03bc(s)\u2261\u03b2(s)\/\u2202s\u03b1(s) while the angle \u03c7 is a\nphase shift which is chosen to select the correct branch of the logarithmic singularity\nin \u03c8\u02dc . We have in mind letting the point p approach the real axis from above which\nmeans that for \u2202s\u03b1(s)> 0 the point s also approaches from above and the phase shift\nis \u03c7 =\u03c0. On the other hand, if \u2202s\u03b1(s)< 0 (as in the Gaussian vortex), s approaches\nfrom below and \u03c7= \u2212\u03c0.\nThis gives a formal solution to the linear problem for the \ufb02uctations driven by any\nexternal frequency p. It then remains to calculate the feedback on the mean pro\ufb01le by\ncalculating the average \u3008\u03c9\u03c8\u2217\u3009 in (2.10). We relegate this calculation to Appendix A\nand give only the \ufb01nal result here, which is a di\ufb00usion equation for \u03c9(r, \u03c4 ),\n\u2202\u03c4\u03c9 + r\n\u22121\u2202r (rF ) = 0, F (r) = \u2212\u03ba(r)\u2202r\u03c9, (2.18)\nwith a radial vorticity \ufb02ux F and an e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity taking the form\n\u03ba\u2217(r) = m2r\u22122|C(p)|2w(p), p \u2261 m\u03b1(r). (2.19)\nIn (2.18) and (2.19) as used for simulations, \u03ba and \u03ba\u2217 are not quite the same: \u03ba\nis a smoothed version of \u03ba\u2217 in a sense that we will clarify shortly. We note that\nthe quantities \u03b1, \u03ba , \u03ba\u2217, F and C all also change with \u03c4 as the underlying pro\ufb01le \u03c9\nevolves but we suppress this dependence for brevity: only the speci\ufb01cation of the\nrandom forcing w(p) is independent of \u03c4 . Instead it is more useful to emphasize the\ndependence of quantities on radius r or frequency p as appropriate.\nThe content of (2.19) is worthy of some comment. At a given radius r , there is a\ncrucial link to a frequency p via the angular velocity \u03b1(r): it is at this frequency that\nthe external forcing is resonant with the motion of \ufb02uid elements, accounting for the\nweighting factor w(p). The quantity C(p) controls the transport and is the strength\nin (2.15) of the singularity at the resonant radius r of the linear solution driven by\nexternal forcing of frequency p. Computing C(p) has to be done numerically for\neach radius r and depends on the whole vorticity pro\ufb01le, through integration of the\nordinary di\ufb00erential equation (2.12) involving the angular velocity \u03b1 and vorticity\ngradient r\u03b2 , linked in turn to \u03c9. The e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity \u03ba\u2217(r) is always non-negative\nand the resulting di\ufb00usion equation is nonlinear and non-local, inheriting these\nproperties from the Euler equation. These features make further analytical progress\ndi\ufb03cult, at least in any general case, but can be dealt with numerically.\nWe also mention the case of a passive scalar \ufb01eld \u03c3 . If we take a \ufb02ow \ufb01eld with\na \ufb01xed angular velocity \u03b1(r) and simply add on the non-axisymmetric component of\nthe random strain \ufb01eld (2.4) to obtain a prescribed purely kinematic \ufb02ow \ufb01eld, the\nRandomly strained two-dimensional vortices 55\n400\n(a) (b)\n300\n200\n100\n0 \u20132 \u20131 0 1 22 4 6 8 10\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\nFigure 1.

(2001) at \u03c4 =0\n(see \u00a7 3).\nresulting radial scalar \ufb02ux is F = \u2212 \u03bascalar (r)\u2202r\u03c3 with\n\u03bascalar (r) = m\n2r\u22122r2mw(p), p \u2261 m\u03b1(r). (2.20)\nThis is in agreement with results given in Bassom & Gilbert (1999), up to\nnormalization. For large r , C(p) \r rm and so this is also the large-r form of\nthe e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity (2.19).\nNotice that in the delta correlated case w(p)= 1, the scalar e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity\n(2.20) has no dependence whatsoever on the axisymmetric component of the \ufb02ow\n\ufb01eld. This is a result of the limit of delta correlation: the external \ufb02ow changes so\nrapidly that the advection by the axisymmetric \ufb02ow component is irrelevant. This is\nnot the case for the fully dynamical vorticity problem: even in the delta correlated\ncase, the pro\ufb01le enters into the quantity C(p) in (2.19). In some loose sense, the\nbehaviour of the vortex introduces a \u2018memory\u2019 into the problem: if a blob of passive\nscalar is moved to a di\ufb00erent radius there is no dynamical response, whereas for a\nblob of vorticity the global \ufb02ow \ufb01eld continues to evolve on its own time scale: this is\nthe rebound phenomenon of Bassom & Gilbert (1999), discussed in the introduction\nand now understood as quasi-mode damping.\nFigure 1(a) shows the e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity \u03ba(r) in (2.19) for the Gaussian pro\ufb01le,\nat \u03c4 =0. (Figure 1b shows the analogous function (3.16) for the model of Balmforth\net al. 2001 discussed later in \u00a7 3). This has a number of interesting features. The\ncorresponding scalar di\ufb00usivity (2.20) is shown dotted, and the two coincide for large\nr . Near the origin, say for r \u0002 3, the vorticity di\ufb00usivity is much smaller than the scalar\ndi\ufb00usivity: this is a consequence of the elastic behaviour of the vortex core discussed\nin the introduction. An external frequency that is in the range to excite \ufb02uctuations\nin the core of the vortex will be met with a wave-like response and no net transport.\nHowever further out, at r \r 4, \u03ba(r) is rather larger than the scalar di\ufb00usivity: here\nthe external forcing meets a large response from the vortex, essentially exciting the\nquasi-mode and giving strong mixing in the critical layer.\n2.2. Numerical results\nWe constructed a code to follow the vorticity on the long \u03c4 time scale. Starting with\nthe pro\ufb01le (2.2) the code integrates the di\ufb00usion equation de\ufb01ned by (2.18) and (2.19);\n\u03b1 is computed from (2.3), C(p) is obtained from (2.12\u20132.17) and we used the delta\ncorrelated case w(p)= 1 in all our computations (other choices give similar results).\nThe details of the numerical method are discussed in Appendix B.\n56 M. R. Turner, A. P. Bassom and A. D. Gilbert\nIf the equations are solved with no smoothing at all (so that \u03ba \u2261 \u03ba\u2217), it turns out\nthat the results are sensitive to the radial grid used, from r =0 to r =R: the \ufb01ner the\ngrid, the closer the steps that form initially. Therefore, to obtain numerical results\nthat have a clear mathematical setting, i.e. independent of resolution, we impose a\ncap on the values of the di\ufb00usivity and smooth the di\ufb00usivity over a small length\nscale. Speci\ufb01cally, once we have computed \u03ba\u2217(r) from (2.19), we replace it by\n\u03ba = \u03bascalarG\u03b4F\u03b4(\u03ba\u2217\/\u03bascalar ). (2.21)\nHere we \ufb01rst normalize \u03ba using the scalar di\ufb00usivity, which grows with a power law\ndependence in (2.20). The \ufb01rst operation then caps this at a level \u03b4\u22121,\nF\u03b4(s) = \u03b4\n\u22121 tanh(s\u03b4), (2.22)\nand the second smooths it over a scale of order \u03b4,\n(G\u03b4f )(s) = \u03c0\n\u22121\/2\u03b4\u22121\n\u222b \u039b\u03b4\n\u2212\u039b\u03b4\ne\u2212(s\u2212s\n\u2032)2\/\u03b42f (s \u2032) ds. (2.23)\nThis smoothing is taken over \u039b=3 standard deviations of the Gaussian, and is done\nnumerically from r =\u039b\u03b4 to r =R\u2212\u039b\u03b4: this covers all the radii at which \ufb01ne structure\ndevelops, and structure in the di\ufb00usivity and vorticity pro\ufb01le is eliminated at scales\nsmaller than \u03b4. We discuss this smoothing further below.\nThe results of runs for the Gaussian initial condition are shown in \ufb01gures 2 and 3:\nthe panels of \ufb01gures 2 and 3 are distinguished by di\ufb00erent values of the smoothing\nparameter \u03b4. Figure 2(a) has the largest smoothing parameter, \u03b4=0.05: reading up\nthe curves shows the evolution of the pro\ufb01le. The Gaussian tail breaks up into\na single step, which then disappears to leave a sharp-edged vortex. In \ufb01gure 2(d )\nthe evolution of the logarithm of the di\ufb00usivity log \u03ba(r) is shown: it may be seen that\na double peak emerges; the \ufb01rst peak, around r =3, corresponds to the \ufb02at part of\nthe step and the second peak lies just beyond the edge of the sharpening vortex. The\ntwo peaks then merge and move inwards, in concert with the sharpening edge of the\nvortex. Another view of our results with this choice of \u03b4 is shown in \ufb01gure 3(a, d ).\nFigure 3(a) depicts the evolution of the vorticity gradient \u2202r\u03c9(r, \u03c4 ) and \ufb01gure 3(d )\ndepicts the e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity \u03ba(r, \u03c4 ) in space\u2013time or \u2018butter\ufb02y\u2019 diagrams.\nFigure 3(a) shows the initial formation of a single vorticity step (with also some\noutgoing ripples), followed by its sudden evaporation to leave a sharp-edged\nvortex. The behaviour of the vorticity gradient is linked to the e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity\n(\ufb01gure 3d ).\nThe evolution we see in \ufb01gures 2(a, d ) and 3(a, d ) is the result of a runaway\nprocess in which the e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity rapidly increases at certain radii. Initially the\nbehaviour of the vortex is roughly that of a damped elastic mode, the quasi-mode.\nThe damping arises from the tail of the Gaussian vortex and limits the response to\nthe external random strain, giving the e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity plotted in \ufb01gure 1(a), with a\npeak around r \r 4. This peak has the e\ufb00ect of \ufb02attening the pro\ufb01le around r \r 4 by\ndi\ufb00usion, leading to less damping of the quasi-mode and so further enhancement of\nthe e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity (the peak also moves inwards because of the modi\ufb01ed pro\ufb01le).\nThis process rapidly di\ufb00uses the vorticity out from the edge of the vortex, to leave\na sharp-edged vortex and high e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity outside. We can characterize this\n\ufb01nal state as a coherent vortex with a very clear edge, surrounded by what is often\ndescribed as a \u2018surf zone\u2019 of enhanced di\ufb00usion (McIntyre & Palmer 1984).\nAs we reduce \u03b4, increasingly \ufb01ne scale structure appears in our runs. In \ufb01gure 2(b, c)\nwe see a more complex picture emerging, in which the pro\ufb01le develops \ufb01ne scale\nRandomly strained two-dimensional vortices 57\n0.25 100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\u201320\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\u201320\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\u201320\n0.20\n0.15\n0.10\n0.05\n0.25\n0.20\n0.15\n0.10\n0.05\n0.25\n0.20\n0.15\n0.10\n0.05\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n( f )\nFigure 2.

The curves show a sequence of vorticity pro\ufb01les \u03c9 (a\u2013c) and corresponding\ne\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivities log \u03ba (d\u2013f ), plotted against r . In each panel the curves are separated by\nadditive constants and given in steps of (a, d ) 0.02 and (b, c, e, f ) 0.002 of \u03c4 , reading up the\ncurves.\nsteps initially (with outgoing ripples), followed by merger. Where the pro\ufb01le is \ufb02at\nthe e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity takes very large values, and where the pro\ufb01le shows sharp\ngradients, the di\ufb00usivity is suppressed. We can think of the vertical regions as barriers,\nwhere reduced di\ufb00usion inhibits transport, surrounding well-mixed regions. We note\nthat there appears to be a limited range of radii where steps form initially, for the\nsmaller values of \u03b4 used. The reason for this became apparent in studying the model of\nBalmforth et al. (2001), and we give numerical results for this in the next section, with\nsome analytical justi\ufb01cation in Appendix C. In this model, with \u03b4=0, there is a range\nof radii for which a \ufb01ne scale instability can occur: a weak small-scale perturbation,\nwavenumber k \u000e 1, on the vorticity pro\ufb01le has a growth rate proportional to k2.\nThis e\ufb00ect, which is natural given the \ufb02attening process described above, gives results\nsensitive to grid scale, no matter what the numerical scheme. The same e\ufb00ect appears\nto occur for the evolution of the Gaussian vortex and is the reason for the introduction\nof the smoothing parameter \u03b4.\n58 M. R. Turner, A. P. Bassom and A. D.

The grey scale coding\nis capped at levels \u2212\u2202r\u03c9=0.05, \u03ba =10, corresponding to black; zero is white. The vertical\nrange is 0\u0002 r \u0002 5 and \u03c4 runs horizontally.\nWe stress that our results are dependent on the choice of the smoothing\nparameter, and this requires some discussion and interpretation. Certainly introducing\na smoothing e\ufb00ect in this way is not ideal, and the instabilities observed strictly show\nthat the multiple scale framework is breaking down, the separation of time scales\nbeing lost. However smoothing the distribution of \u03ba is physically natural. The point\nis that in our weakly nonlinear framework there is no mechanism to saturate the\nresponse to an external frequency if the vortex pro\ufb01le develops a neutral normal\nmode. However in the original unscaled problem nonlinearity will step in and limit\nthe excursions of \ufb02uid particles. In fact, if a vortex is subjected to a single frequency\np for a long time, there follows the development of cat\u2019s eyes of a width \u03b51\/2 in\nthe vortex pro\ufb01le. This is the width of the resonance, limited by the local gradient\nof angular velocity (which incidentally does not generate the same \ufb01ne scales as the\nvorticity pro\ufb01le). It is thus natural to limit \u03ba to be smooth over scales \u03b4=O(\u03b51\/2).\nSimilarly the di\ufb00usivity is dimensionally LU=O(\u03b53\/2) for motion across a cat\u2019s eye\nof width L=O(\u03b51\/2) with velocity U=O(\u03b5): however this is on the short t time scale\nand corresponds to a limit \u03ba =O(\u03b5\u22121\/2) on the long \u03c4 time scale.\nIn short it is natural to introduce a parameter \u03b4 of order \u03b51\/2 and to use it to\nsmooth the e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity over scales \u03b4 and cap at values \u03b4\u22121. We normalize by\nthe scalar di\ufb00usivity in order not to cap the algebraic growth of \u03ba for large r , which\nRandomly strained two-dimensional vortices 59\nis reasonable as this is the true e\ufb00ect of random strain, with its growing velocity\n\ufb01eld as r \u2192 \u221e. As we do not have any more systematic way to estimate \u03b4 and its\ndependence on radius and time, we have taken it to be constant for each run and\nexplored the consequences as it is reduced. Finally we note that while smoothing \u03ba\nover a scale \u03b4 is crucial as it limits the scale of the formation of steps, capping the\nvalue of \u03ba is less important. A number of ways of doing this (including not doing\nso) were explored, and gave results that are very similar: the choice only changes just\nhow \ufb02at the vorticity steps are, not their formation nor their merger and the stripping\nat the vortex edge.\n3. Random strain in the model of Balmforth et al. (2001)\n3.1. Analytical development\nFor the Gaussian vortex we observed a clear range of radii where the e\ufb00ective\ndi\ufb00usivity is enhanced, and where steps in the pro\ufb01le emerge and merge. The core\nof the vortex (for example 0\u0002 r \u0002 2) is relatively unscathed. This suggests exploiting\nan asymptotic framework in which a simpli\ufb01ed model is used for the vortex core.\nFortunately such a framework exists and is derived in Balmforth et al. (2001). The\nstarting point is a compact vortex, for example a Rankine vortex, with vorticity\nstrictly zero at some radius, the edge of the vortex. The vortex is assumed to support\na neutral, normal mode whose critical layer, where \ufb02uid particles corotate with the\nmode, lies at a radius rc which is outside the vortex. The model consists of an ordinary\ndi\ufb00erential equation (ODE) for the complex amplitude \u03d5\u02c6(t) of the normal mode and\na partial di\ufb00erential equation (PDE) for the evolution of weak vorticity \u03b6 in the thin\ncritical layer about the radius rc. This model captures at a qualitative level many\nphenomena that can occur in a Gaussian vortex subject to external strain \ufb01elds:\nthe ODE models the e\u00b1im\u03b8 wave-like distortions of the central core, while the PDE\ncaptures the formation of cat\u2019s eyes and mixing of vorticity on the periphery. The two\nare coupled: the normal mode creates mixing in the layer, and mixing of vorticity can\nfeed back to stabilize or destabilize the normal mode.\nThe governing equations for the forced model are\n\u2202t\u03b6 + y\u2202\u03b8\u03b6 + [\u2202y(y + \u03b6 )]\u2202\u03b8\u03d5 = 0, (3.1)\ni\u2202t \u03d5\u02c6 = \u03b5q(t) + P\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndy\n\u222e\nd\u03b8\n2\u03c0\n\u03b6e\u2212im\u03b8 , (3.2)\n\u03d5(\u03b8, t) = \u03d5\u02c6(t)eim\u03b8 + c. c. (3.3)\nWe refer the reader to Balmforth et al. (2001) for a derivation and detailed description\nand only note here that in (3.1) y is a scaled inwardly pointing radial coordinate with\ny =0 corresponding to the centre of the critical layer. The vorticity in the layer is\ny + \u03b6 (y, \u03b8, t), and is transported in the angular velocity of the vortex, the y\u2202\u03b8\u03b6 term,\nand because of radial motion from the normal mode via the term involving the \ufb02ow\n\u2202\u03b8\u03d5. This \ufb02ow is simply linked by (3.3) to the amplitude \u03d5\u02c6(t) of the normal mode,\ngoverned by the ODE (3.2). In this equation the weak external random \ufb02ow \u03b5q(t) is\npresent, plus a feedback from the vorticity in the critical layer involving a principal\nvalue integral over y.\nWe exploit the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0 by introducing a long time scale \u03c4 = \u03b52t , and a weakly\nnonlinear expansion\n\u03b6 (y, t, \u03c4 )= \u03b6 (y, \u03c4 ) + \u03b5\u03b6\u02c6 (y, t, \u03c4 )eim\u03b8 + c. c.+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .

Gilbert\nReplacing \u03d5\u02c6 by \u03b5\u03d5\u02c6, on the fast t time scale we have the system\n\u2202t \u03b6\u02c6 + imy\u03b6\u02c6 + (1 + \u2202y\u03b6 )im\u03d5\u02c6 = 0, (3.5)\ni\u2202t \u03d5\u02c6 = q + P\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndy \u03b6\u02c6 . (3.6)\nThis gives advection of vorticity \ufb02uctuations on a mean, background distribution\ny + \u03b6 that depends on y but does not vary on the short time scale t . On the longer \u03c4\ntime scale we have a conservation equation for the mean pro\ufb01le\n\u2202\u03c4 \u03b6 + \u2202yF = 0, F = 2m Im\u3008\u03b6\u02c6 \u03d5\u02c6\u2217\u3009. (3.7)\nHere the brackets denote both an average over t as well as an ensemble average over\nthe distribution of random \ufb02ow amplitudes q(t). From now on we drop the hats from\n\ufb02uctuating quantities; we shall also not stress the dependence on \u03c4 of the various\nquantities in the problem.\nOur plan is to solve the \ufb02uctuating problem (3.5) and (3.6) for \u03b6 and \u03d5 with any\nbackground mean pro\ufb01le \u03b6 , and then isolate the \ufb02ux F in (3.7) to give a di\ufb00usion\nequation for this pro\ufb01le on the long time scale. Using (2.11), (3.5) and (3.6) in Laplace\ntransform space become\n(\u2212ip + imy)\u03b6\u02dc + im(1 + \u2202y\u03b6 )\u03d5\u02dc = 0, (3.8)\np\u03d5\u02dc = q\u02dc + P\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndy \u03b6\u02dc , (3.9)\nand are solved straightforwardly (with zero initial conditions) so that\n\u03b6\u02dc (p) = K(y, p)M(p) q\u02dc(p), \u03d5\u02dc(p) = M(p)q\u02dc(p), (3.10)\nwhere\nK(y, p) =\n1 + \u2202y\u03b6 (y)\np\/m \u2212 y , L(p) = P\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndy K(y, p), M(p) =\n1\np \u2212 L(p) . (3.11)\nHere the principal value integral for L(p) refers to the limit y \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, but in addition\nwe need to note that the contour \u0393 sits above the real axis, and when brought down\nmeets a pole at p=my from the de\ufb01nition of K(y, p). We can extract the integral\nover the singular component (1 + \u2202y\u03b6 (p\/m))\/(p\/m \u2212 y) and evaluate this exactly for\np above the real axis. There is then no obstruction to bringing the contour \u0393 down\nto the real axis, in other words making p real. Writing L=Lr + iLi in terms of real\nand imaginary parts we have\nLr(p) = \u2212P\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndy\n\u2202y\u03b6 (y) \u2212 \u2202y\u03b6 (p\/m)\ny \u2212 p\/m , Li(p) = \u2212\u03c0(1 + \u2202y\u03b6 (p\/m)). (3.12)\nThis solution may seem rather formal but given a pro\ufb01le \u03b6 (y), L and M are easily\nobtained numerically for any real value of p. Note that if the vorticity gradient is a\nconstant, \u03b6 (y)= 0, then L(p)= \u2212i\u03c0. This gives a simple pole in\nM(p) = (p + i\u03c0)\u22121 (3.13)\nat p= \u2212i\u03c0 which is used in the formula (3.16) below. This pole corresponds to the\nquasi-mode damping rate e\u2212ipt =e\u2212\u03c0t (as in Balmforth et al. 2001). For more general\npro\ufb01les a computation of M(p) will determine the damping rate for quasi-modes (e.g.\nHall, Bassom & Gilbert 2003).\nRandomly strained two-dimensional vortices 61\nGiven this solution it is now just a question of computing the average \u3008\u03b6\u02c6 \u03d5\u02c6\u2217\u3009 that\nprovides the \ufb02ux F in (3.7). This calculation is described in Appendix A: the result\nis that the vorticity \u03c9= y + \u03b6 (y, \u03c4 ) in the layer is governed by the di\ufb00usion equation\nfor \u03b6 ,\n\u2202\u03c4 \u03b6 + \u2202yF = 0, F (y) = \u2212\u03ba(y)\u2202y(y + \u03b6 ), (3.14)\nwith di\ufb00usivity\n\u03ba\u2217(y) = m2|M(p)|2w(p), p \u2261 my. (3.15)\nHere we have the weight function w(p) from (2.5) or (2.6) and the quantity M(p)\nwhich gives the response of the vortex to frequency p and is determined by an\nintegration over the vorticity distribution in the layer (see (3.11)): as a result the\ndi\ufb00usivity depends nonlinearly and non-locally on the pro\ufb01le y + \u03b6 (y). At \u03c4 =0 with\na uniform gradient initially, \u03c9= y, we have\n\u03ba\u2217(y) = m2(m2y2 + \u03c02)\u22121w(p), (3.16)\nand this is shown in \ufb01gure 1(b) (for w(p)\u2261 1). This is analogous to the peak in the\ncurve in \ufb01gure 1(a), con\ufb01rming that the framework in Balmforth et al. (2001) should\nmodel the transport in the tail of the Gaussian vortex. As in the Gaussian case, we\ncap and smooth \u03ba\u2217 using a parameter \u03b4 to obtain \u03ba , with\n\u03ba = G\u03b4F\u03b4(\u03ba\u2217). (3.17)\nWe again have in mind linking \u03b4 to the quantity \u03b51\/2, where \u03b5 \b 1 is the strength of\nthe forcing. (Note that in this case we have not normalized by a scalar di\ufb00usivity as\nthere is no power law growth with increasing y.)\n3.2. Numerical results\nFigures 4 and 5 show numerical results for simulations of the di\ufb00usion equation (3.14)\nand (3.15) with M(p) computed as detailed in (3.11) and (3.12). Figure 4 (a, b) shows\nvorticity pro\ufb01les analogous to those of \u03c9 in the left panels of \ufb01gure 2, bearing in mind\nthat y increases radially inwards. The corresponding e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivities are shown\nin the right panels of the two \ufb01gures. There are strong similarities between the full\nevolution of the Gaussian initial condition and the simpli\ufb01ed model of Balmforth et\nal. (2001), con\ufb01rming the usefulness of the model in capturing many phenomena at\na qualitative level. The model system shows the development of a vorticity staircase.\nThe \ufb02attened regions are characterized by strongly enhanced di\ufb00usivity: in between\nthere are transport barriers, where the reduced di\ufb00usivity allows high gradients to\npersist.\nThe butter\ufb02y diagrams in \ufb01gure 5 are analogous to those in \ufb01gure 3 for the\nGaussian case. Again we see many similarities: steps are formed and merge, and\nthere are also ripples at the edge, moving towards the origin y =0, particularly\nvisible in 5(c, d ), and seen in the Gaussian case in \ufb01gure 3. Of course there are\nalso di\ufb00erences, and we stress that the model of Balmforth et al. (2001) is not an\nasymptotic approximation to a Gaussian vortex so comparisons are only qualitative.\nThe key di\ufb00erence appears to be that in the model the critical layer is embedded in an\nin\ufb01nitely wide vorticity gradient, on the appropriate small scale y, as is clear in \ufb01gure 4.\nThe gradient traps the vorticity staircase, while the e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity \u03ba(y) drops away\non either side (\ufb01gure 1b). This matches the behaviour for the Gaussian vortex around\nr =4, but there the random strain \ufb01eld takes over for increasing radii and the e\ufb00ective\ndi\ufb00usivity increases, as seen in \ufb01gure 1(a). This tends to make the Gaussian picture\nasymmetrical, and allows vorticity to be stripped to in\ufb01nity, not possible in the model.\n62 M. R. Turner, A. P. Bassom and A. D.

In each panel the curves are separated by additive\nconstants and given for \u03c4 =0, 0.1, 0.2, etc., reading up the curves.\n(Note that there is some symmetry breaking in the numerical runs in \ufb01gure 5(d, e):\nthe mathematical problem is strictly symmetric in y, but instabilities soon break this,\nwhether seeded by rounding or truncation error, or by initializing \u03b6 with weak noise,\nas we do.)\nWe observe from \ufb01gure 5 that as the smoothing parameter \u03b4 is reduced we obtain\n\ufb01ner scales in the problem, and a more rapid onset of the growth of steps, over\na very clearly de\ufb01ned range of y values. To see this clearly \ufb01gure 6 shows a run\nwith \u03b4=0.005, the smallest value used, with evolution over a short time interval in\n\ufb01gure 6(a) and over a longer interval in \ufb01gure 6(b). Over the short time we see a\nrapid growth of \ufb01ne scale structure and waves (limited by the value of \u03b4); these\nform \ufb01nely spaced steps which then show a merger process, over both short times in\n\ufb01gure 6(a) and longer times in \ufb01gure 6(b). The initial development at \ufb01rst suggests\na \u2018negative di\ufb00usion\u2019 type instability with a growth rate increasing with wavenumber\nk of the initial \ufb02uctuations, perhaps as O(k2). For example, this is reminiscent of the\nCahn\u2013Hilliard equation where di\ufb00usion with a negative di\ufb00usivity is controlled on the\nsmallest scales by a fourth derivative: \ufb01ne structure develops initially and then scales\nincrease as phase separation occurs and domains merge. However in our simulations\n\u03ba(y)\u0003 0 at all times, and also \u03ba(r)\u0003 0 in the Gaussian case. The initial development\nof \ufb01ne structure arises through the term (\u2202y\u03ba)\u2202y(y + \u03b6 ), from expanding the di\ufb00usive\nterm \u2202y(\u03ba\u2202y(y + \u03b6 )) in (3.14) as we now explain.\nSuppose we start a linear vorticity pro\ufb01le \u03c9= y, and add on a weak \ufb01ne scale\nvorticity distribution \u03b6 (y)=\u03bc sin ky with \u03bc\b 1 and k \u000e 1. Now the corresponding \u03ba\nwill also be perturbed from (3.16) with a component of magnitude \u03bc and wavenumber\nk.

This band is perhaps a little narrower than the range indicated from theory,\npresumably because of nonlinear e\ufb00ects that will occur most quickly at the centre,\nbut have a wider in\ufb02uence.\nThis calculation is detailed in Appendix C. We believe this also gives an\ninterpretation for the formation of ever \ufb01ner scales in the Gaussian vortex as \u03b4 \u2192 0,\nand think it is likely that there is a range of radii at which this can occur. It would\nbe interesting to determine the range, but we do not know how to do this.\n4. Discussion\nWe have investigated the evolution of a coherent two-dimensional vortex subjected\nto weak external random strain, both starting with a Gaussian vortex and using the\nasymptotic model (Balmforth et al. 2001) of compact vortex core and weak vorticity\nskirt. Averaging over the external random strain allowed us to write down a di\ufb00usion\nequation for the mean vorticity pro\ufb01le. The e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity is linked explicitly to\nthe stability properties of the pro\ufb01le: although the link is nonlinear and non-local, it\ncan be calculated to give the di\ufb00usivity as a function of radius for any given vorticity\npro\ufb01le.\nWe then time-stepped this di\ufb00usion equation to attempt to understand the coupling\nbetween mixing of vorticity and the vortex response for axisymmetric \ufb02ow starting\nwith a Gaussian vortex and for the model of Balmforth et al. (2001). We have found\nthat the dynamical response gives similar features in both cases with the generation of\n\ufb01ne scale steps forming a vorticity staircase. In the \ufb02at regions of the steps the e\ufb00ective\ndi\ufb00usivity is large, while in between small values of the e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity allow high\nRandomly strained two-dimensional vortices 65\n+\n\u2013 \u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n+\n+\n+\nExternal\nstrain\nStep\nVortex\ncore\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 7.

Merger processes tend\nto reduce the number of steps, and in the Gaussian case we \ufb01nd that vorticity is\nstripped to in\ufb01nity, leaving a sharp-edged vortex. Surrounding this is a region where\nthe e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity is large.\nMuch of what we see in the Gaussian case is reproduced in the model of Balmforth\net al. (2001), which allowed us both to pursue higher numerical resolutions, and\nto understand the initial development of \ufb01ne scales. In addition we can give a\nheuristic description of how the sharp vertical parts of steps are maintained in the\npro\ufb01le, shown in \ufb01gure 7 (see Hall et al. 2003). It amounts to the fact that there is\ndamping of quasi-modes (corresponding to a normal mode on the vortex core) in\nthe presence of a vorticity gradient at the appropriate critical radius. In \ufb01gure 7(a)\nthere is external rotating strain, frequency p, acting on a vortex core surrounded by a\ncorotating vertical vorticity step at r with p=m\u03b1(r). The external strain distorts the\nstep into an ellipse in (b), creating the +\/\u2212 vorticity anomaly and \ufb02ow shown. This\ndistorts the vortex core giving the secondary vorticity anomaly and \ufb02ow indicated\nin (c), which has the e\ufb00ect of countering the original external strain and restoring\nthe step to circular form. Thus an external frequency that is tuned to mix vorticity\nin the vertical part of the step is damped and mixing suppressed. For a frequency\nthat corresponds to a \ufb02at part of a step and a low gradient at the critical radius, no\nvorticity anomaly is created and so there is no damping mechanism.\nThe development of vorticity staircases and inhomogeneous mixing is mirrored in\nobservations and simulations of geophysical \ufb02ows. For example, simulations of Norton\n(1994) and Waugh & Plumb (1994) of stratospheric polar vortex dynamics indicate\na coherent vortex core, undergoing signi\ufb01cant distortions (greater than in our study),\nsurrounded by a \u2018surf zone\u2019 of breaking Rossby waves (McIntyre & Palmer 1984).\nSuch sharp-edged vortices can also be generated by the process of vortex stripping (e.g.\nMariotti, Legras & Dritschel 1994), where the \ufb02ow generates a hyperbolic separatrix\nat the edge of the vortex, which erodes vorticity on a very rapid time scale. The\nstripping we see, which leaves a sharp edge in simulations of the Gaussian vortex, is\nin some ways a milder process, as it results from the accumulation of weak random\nexternal strain over a long time scale: nonetheless it too results from the algebraic\ngrowth of the random strain \ufb01eld with radius. Steps in potential vorticity \ufb01elds are\nalso seen in atmospheric data; see for example Dritschel & McIntyre (2008), who\nreview observations, discuss physical mechanisms and present numerical simulations.\nHere the vorticity gradients in our models are replaced by a background vorticity\ngradient or \u03b2-e\ufb00ect, which governs jet width scaling in geophysical problems. Banded\n66 M. R. Turner, A. P. Bassom and A. D. Gilbert\nstructures are seen in giant gaseous planets, most notably Jupiter and Saturn, and\nemerge in simulations of randomly forced spherical shallow water models and in\nconvective deep models (Rotvig & Jones 2006; Heimpel & Aurnou 2007; Scott &\nPolvani 2007). It would be interesting to extend the present study to derive a di\ufb00usion\nequation for \ufb02uid motions on a sphere in the case of a two-dimensional \ufb02uid or a\nshallow water system, building on the weakly nonlinear study of Garaud (2001), who\nfollowed the e\ufb00ects of shear instability in \ufb02ows relevant to the solar tachocline.\nThe weakest part of our study is the necessity to introduce a smoothing (and\ncapping) of the e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity, via the parameter \u03b4. This is forced upon us by the\npresence of instabilities of arbitrarily rapid growth rate, on the long time scale. These\nwould in practice be controlled by nonlinearity on the short time scale, which is not\npresent in our analysis, nor are we aware of any easy way in which to incorporate\nit. The next step is to see whether full simulations of randomly forced vortices, with\nnonlinearity, reproduce the results seen here and to see how far our assumptions of\nweak external forcing, and consequent evolution of the pro\ufb01le on a long time scale,\nmay be relaxed. Also, because we cannot justify the form of the smoothing and\ncapping parameter \u03b4, we have not explored the very long time limit \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e: we expect\nmergers of steps in the two models to occur, over increasingly lengthy time scales,\nleaving a step-less compact vortex in the Gaussian case. This would be interesting to\nexplore in a full numerical model.\nA further direction of research would be in understanding the nature and role of the\nexternal forcing q(t) and its weight function w(p) in more realistic \ufb02ows. For example,\nin two-dimensional turbulence the irrotational \ufb02ows of magnitude \u03b5 generated by other\nvortices would vary on a slow time scale of order \u03b5t , corresponding to a peak of w(p)\nat the corresponding low frequencies. The e\ufb00ects we have discussed would then come\nfrom the high-frequency tail of this peak: although w(p) would fall o\ufb00, the dynamics\nof the vortex tends to amplify the e\ufb00ects of frequencies p which interact with the\nquasi-mode, i.e. via the resonant peak seen in \ufb01gure 1(a), and pick out the frequencies\nthat give mixing and step formation at the periphery of the vortex on the slower \u03b52t = \u03c4\ntime scale. This would again be best studied by means of numerical simulations.\nWe thank the referees for helpful comments which improved the paper. We are\ngrateful to the Leverhulme Trust which supported A.

(2001)\nThe feedback onto the mean pro\ufb01le in (3.7) is governed by \u3008\u03b6 (y, t)\u03d5\u2217(t)\u3009 and we have\n(\u22122\u03c0)2\u03b6 (y, t)\u03d5\u2217(t) = (1 + \u2202y\u03b6 )\n\u222b\n\u0393\ndp\n\u222b\n\u0393 \u2032\ndp\u2032\ne\u2212i(p\u2212p\u2032)t\np\/m \u2212 y M(p)M\n\u2217(p\u2032) q\u02dc(p)q\u02dc\u2217(p\u2032), (A 6)\nby (2.11), (A 2), (3.10) and (3.11). For our purposes we need to assume that M(p) is\nanalytic except for singularities S in a set bounded below the real axis. The distance\n\u0013=\u0013(\u03c4 ) of S below the real axis, i.e. the width of the analyticity strip of M(p), will\ngenerally decrease with \u03c4 as the vorticity pro\ufb01le evolves, and the theory breaks down\nif \u0013(\u03c4 ) becomes zero: this is in fact what happens in the simulations, and why we\nhave to adopt a smoothing for the resulting large values of the di\ufb00usivity, modelling\nnonlinear saturation of the mixing. Although we have to adopt this ad hoc procedure\nfor the simulations, we set out the theory with the assumption that the pro\ufb01le at the\ngiven time \u03c4 is stable, i.e. \u0013(\u03c4 )> 0.\nEnsemble averaging and substituting the correlation function (A 4) for the delta\ncorrelated case gives\n(\u22122\u03c0)2\u3008\u03b6 (y, t)\u03d5\u2217(t)\u3009 = (1 + \u2202y\u03b6 )\n\u222b\n\u0393\ndp\n\u222b\n\u0393 \u2032\ndp\u2032\ne\u2212i(p\u2212p\u2032)t\np\/m \u2212 y\ni\np \u2212 p\u2032 M(p)M\n\u2217(p\u2032). (A 7)\nFigure 8 depicts the contours \u0393 and \u0393 \u2032 in the complex plane together with the\nsingularities S of M(p) below the real axis, and singularities S\u2217 of M\u2217(p\u2032) above. We\nclose the \u0393 \u2032 contour in the upper half plane using the exponential decay of eip\u2032t there.\nThis encloses the pole p\u2032 =p (but no pole at my) and any other singularities S\u2217 of\nM\u2217(p\u2032). We can ignore the e\ufb00ect of S\u2217 as singularities contribute only exponentially\ndecaying terms, decaying at least as e\u2212\u0013(\u03c4 )t , that disappear on the fast time scale. In\nother words we are implicitly averaging the right-hand side over the fast time scale,\nalthough we have not put in angled brackets for reasons of readability. We are left\nwith\n(\u22122\u03c0)\u3008\u03b6 (y, t)\u03d5\u2217(t)\u3009 = (1 + \u2202y\u03b6 )\n\u222b\n\u0393\ndp\n1\np\/m \u2212 y M(p)M\n\u2217(p). (A 8)\nWe note that we in fact only require the imaginary part to form the \ufb02ux F in (3.7).\nTo deal with this integral, we bring the contour down to lie along the real axis, except\nat the pole p=my. On the real axis, since\nM(p)M\u2217(p) = |M(p)|2 for p real (A 9)\n68 M. R. Turner, A. P. Bassom and A. D. Gilbert\np' \u0393'\n\u0393p\nmy\nS*\nS\nFigure 8. Schematic picture of contours \u0393 and \u0393 \u2032 in the complex plane, discussed in\nthe text.\nfrom (A1), we only obtain a real contribution to the integral, which we do not\nneed. Integrating anticlockwise around the semicircle above the pole p=my leaves\nan imaginary contribution of i\u03c0 times the residue to give\n(\u22122\u03c0) Im\u3008\u03b6 (y, t)\u03d5\u2217(t)\u3009 = (1 + \u2202y\u03b6 )\u03c0m|M(my)|2. (A 10)\nThis yields the \ufb02ux and e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity\nF = \u2212\u03ba(y)(1 + \u2202y\u03b6 ), \u03ba(y) = m2|M(my)|2. (A 11)\nThe calculation is similar for the exponential correlation function (2.6) with (A 5) and\nintroduces the factor w(p) into (3.15).\nWe present an alternative derivation of the result for \u03ba(y): we need this so that we\ncan proceed more swiftly in the axisymmetric case next. We start with the complex\nconjugate version of (A 6), which is, after substituting the correlation function (A 4),\n(\u22122\u03c0)2\u3008\u03d5(y, t)\u03b6 \u2217(t)\u3009 = (1 + \u2202y\u03b6 )\n\u222b\n\u0393\ndp\n\u222b\n\u0393 \u2032\ndp\u2032\ne\u2212i(p\u2212p\u2032)t\np\u2032\/m \u2212 y\ni\np \u2212 p\u2032 M(p)M\n\u2217(p\u2032), (A 12)\nand close the p\u2032 contour in the upper half plane. Now we pick up the residues from\nthe poles at p\u2032 =p and at p\u2032 =my in \ufb01gure 8; the result can be written as\n(\u22122\u03c0)\u3008\u03d5(y, t)\u03b6 \u2217(t)\u3009 = (1 + \u2202y\u03b6 )\n\u222b\n\u0393\ndp\nM(p)M\u2217(p)\np\/m \u2212 y\n(\n1 \u2212 M\n\u2217(my)\nM\u2217(p)\ne\u2212i(p\u2212my)t\n)\n. (A 13)\nThis integral has a removable singularity at p=my and the integration contour may\nbe moved to lie entirely along the real axis! However we remember that we only\nrequire the imaginary part of this expression and that we are implicitly averaging over\ntime. Except within an O(t\u22121) neighbourhood of p=my the exponential averages to\nzero to leave a quantity that is purely real and so can be discarded. The imaginary\npart of the integral comes only from this neighbourhood and is at leading order\n(\u22122\u03c0) Im\u3008\u03d5(y, t)\u03b6 \u2217(t)\u3009 = \u2212(1 + \u2202y\u03b6 )|M(my)|2\n\u222b my+T\nmy\u2212T\ndp\nsin((p \u2212 my)t)\np\/m \u2212 y , (A 14)\nwhere we have set t\u22121 <T \b 1 and reversed the contour direction. The integral here\nis m\u03c0 at leading order, and so the result is in agreement with (A 10).\nRandomly strained two-dimensional vortices 69\nA.2. Axisymmetric \ufb02ow\nWe now turn to the axisymmetric case in which the feedback on the mean pro\ufb01le in\n(2.10) involves\n(\u22122\u03c0)2\u3008\u03c8(r, t)\u03c9\u2217(r, t)\u3009 =\n\u222b\n\u0393\ndp\n\u222b\n\u0393 \u2032\ndp\u2032 M(r, p)N\u2217(r, p\u2032)\ni\np \u2212 p\u2032 e\n\u2212i(p\u2212p\u2032)t , (A 15)\nfor the delta correlated case. For each value of p we close the p\u2032 contour. The\nsituation is depicted in \ufb01gure 8, except that my is replaced by m\u03b1(r). From (2.15) with\np\u2032 =m\u03b1(s \u2032) replacing p there is a pole singularity in N(r, p\u2032) as now p\u2032 varies, which\ntakes the form\nN(r, p\u2032) = \u2212C(m\u03b1(r))m\u03b2(r)(m\u03b1(r) \u2212 p\u2032)\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (A 16)\n(using the de\ufb01nition of \u03bc(r) below (2.17)). After picking up the residues from the two\npoles p\u2032 =p and p\u2032 =m\u03b1(r) of the p\u2032 integration we are left with\n(\u22122\u03c0)\u3008\u03c8(r, t)\u03c9\u2217(r, t)\u3009 =\n\u222b\n\u0393\ndpM(r, p)\n(\nN\u2217(r, p) \u2212 m\u03b2(r)C\n\u2217(m\u03b1(r))\np \u2212 m\u03b1(r) e\n\u2212i(p\u2212m\u03b1(r))t\n)\n.\n(A 17)\nThe argument then follows that for the model of Balmforth et al. (2001) after (A 13).\nThe singularity at p=m\u03b1(r) is removable and so we can deform the \u0393 contour to the\nreal axis and reverse its direction. Away from p=m\u03b1(r) the exponential averages to\nzero, and the product M(r, p)N\u2217(r, p) is real (as \u03c8\u02dc is a real multiple of \u03c9\u02dc in (2.12)). In\nthe O(t\u22121) neighbourhood of p=m\u03b1(r) only, there is a contribution to the imaginary\npart, leaving\n2\u03c0 Im\u3008\u03c8(r, t)\u03c9\u2217(r, t)\u3009 = \u03c0m\u03b2(r)|C(m\u03b1(r))|2. (A 18)\nThe resulting \ufb02ux can be written as\nF = \u2212\u03ba(r)\u2202r\u03c9, \u03ba(r) = m2r\u22122|C(m\u03b1(r))|2. (A 19)\nSimilarly, for advection of a passive scalar we instead solve\n\u2202t\u03c3 + im\u03b1\u03c3 = \u2212im\u03b2\u03c8 = \u2212im\u03b2rmq(t), (A 20)\nwhere \u03b1(r) is the angular velocity of a given \ufb02ow \ufb01eld and \u03b2 = r\u22121\u2202r\u03c3 to obtain (2.20).\nAppendix B. Numerical methods\nThe di\ufb00usion equation for the system in Balmforth et al. (2001)\n\u2202\u03c4 \u03b6 = \u2202y(\u03ba(y)\u2202y\u03b6 ), (B 1)\nwith (3.11) and (3.15), was simulated numerically using a simply constructed code,\nsecond order in space and time, in which the variable y is discretized with N points\nyj in the interval [\u2212Y, Y ]. We use a corresponding grid of points pj =myj in the\ninterval [\u2212mY,mY ] where Y is chosen to be large enough to capture all the interesting\nbehaviour in \u03b6 . We set up the initial conditions and add very weak random noise\nto the vorticity values (at a level of 10\u22126) to trigger instabilities (otherwise these are\ngenerated by rounding or truncation error and so dependent on machine precision or\nchoice of grid and time step). The process is then as follows.\n70 M. R. Turner, A. P. Bassom and A. D. Gilbert\nWe evaluate \u2202y\u03b6 at points yj on the grid using \ufb01nite di\ufb00erences and then L(p) at\nthe grid points pj using (3.12) with Lr (p) written as\nLr(p) = \u2212\n\u222b Y\n\u2212Y\ndy\n\u2202y\u03b6 (y) \u2212 \u2202y\u03b6 (p\/m)\ny \u2212 p\/m + \u2202y\u03b6 (p\/m) log\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Y + p\/mY \u2212 p\/m\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 . (B 2)\nFrom this we compute \u03ba\u2217 at the gridpoints yj from (3.15) and (3.11). We cap and\nsmooth \u03ba\u2217 to give \u03ba according to (3.17).\nThe mean pro\ufb01le is then stepped in time using a modi\ufb01ed Crank\u2013Nicolson method.\nStarting with the current \ufb01eld at time t = k\u0013t , this method would usually involve\nsolving nonlinear equations for the future \ufb01eld \u03b6 and the di\ufb00usivity \u03ba at time t +\u0013t .\nHowever as the di\ufb00usivity is a complicated functional of the \ufb01eld this is not practical.\nThus the method is combined with a predictor\u2013corrector step: the present di\ufb00usivity\nis held constant while the \ufb01eld alone is stepped from t to t + \u0013t . This gives an\nestimate of the future \ufb01eld, from which an estimate of the future di\ufb00usivity may\nbe computed and \ufb01nally used to take another Crank\u2013Nicolson step for the \ufb01eld\nfrom t to t + \u0013t . This process can be iterated, but tests indicate that two steps\n(one to estimate the di\ufb00usivity and one to step the \ufb01eld) are su\ufb03cient. In \ufb01gure 5,\nparameter values used are, in \ufb01gure 5(a) (N, Y,\u0013t)= (8000, 10, 5\u00d7 10\u22124), \ufb01gure 5(b)\n(N, Y,\u0013t)= (16 000, 10, 2\u00d7 10\u22124) and \ufb01gure 5(c, d, e) (N, Y,\u0013t)= (32 000, 10, 10\u22124)\nand for \ufb01gure 6, (N, Y,\u0013t)= (32 000, 6, 2.5\u00d7 10\u22125).\nFor the full, Gaussian problem, a similarly structured code was written to time step\nthe di\ufb00usion equation\n\u2202\u03c4\u03c9 = r\n\u22121\u2202r (r\u03ba(r)\u2202r\u03c9), (B 3)\nwith \u03ba given in (2.19) and C(p) in (2.12)\u2013(2.17). The code starts with \u03c9 known on\na radial grid rj with N points from 0 to R. The quantities pj =\u03b1(rj ) and \u03b2(rj ) are\ncalculated using a cubic spline \ufb01t while for each grid point rj the code computes\nC(pj ) as follows. We let h be a small positive numerical parameter and interpolate\nthe relevant functions onto a \ufb01ner grid with M points, M \u000eN . The ODE (2.12) is\nintegrated from r =h using \u03c8\u02dc(h, p)=hm and \u2202r\u03c8\u02dc(h, p)=mh\nm\u22121 to r = rj \u2212 h using\na fourth order Runge\u2013Kutta scheme. The solution is then stepped over the critical\npoint, from rj \u2212 h to rj + h, using the jump conditions from (2.16), (2.17), namely,\n[\u03c8\u02dc]+\u2212 = 0, [\u2202r\u03c8\u02dc]\n+\n\u2212 = i\u03c7\u03bc(rj )\u03c8\u02dc(rj ) (B 4)\n(in our case \u03c7 = \u2212\u03c0) and \ufb01nally integrated out to R where \u03c8\u02dc \u221d rm. The solution is\nthen divided throughout by the (complex) constant of proportionality so as to satisfy\n(2.13) and the resulting value of \u03c8\u02dc at r = rj is then just C(pj ). Note that a check on\nthis part of the code exists: solutions obtained for a Gaussian mean pro\ufb01le are given\nin \ufb01gure 3 of Le Dize`s (2000).\nOnce the code has C(pj ) for each radius rj , it may evaluate \u03ba(rj ), smooth it and\nstep the mean pro\ufb01le \u03c9 by applying the modi\ufb01ed Crank\u2013Nicolson scheme used for\nthe model of Balmforth et al. (2001), with a no-\ufb02ux condition for the vorticity at the\norigin and a zero vorticity boundary condition at r =R. For the simulations shown in\n\ufb01gures 2 and 3, parameter values used are (N,M,R, h)= (4000, 24N, 10, R\/M) and\n\ufb01gures 2(a) and 3(a) \u0013t =10\u22124 and \ufb01gures 2(b, c) and 3(b, c) 10\u22125.\nAppendix C. Instability in the model of Balmforth et al. (2001)\nWe initially ran the code for the model with no smoothing \u03b4=0 and found that\nthe results depend strongly on numerical method, time-step and grid resolution. We\nRandomly strained two-dimensional vortices 71\nwere led to consider the evolution of weak, small scale perturbations on a pro\ufb01le and\nto what extent these may be ampli\ufb01ed or suppressed by their e\ufb00ect on \u03ba . Consider a\nsmooth mean pro\ufb01le \u03b6 (y) which is perturbed to\n\u03b6 (y) + \u0013\u03b6 (y) \u2261 \u03b6 (y) + \u03bc sin ky, (C 1)\nwith \u03bc\b 1 and k \u000e 1. We linearize, retaining only terms of order \u03bc, and it is\nconvenient to use \u0013 to denote the change in a quantity to this order. The perturbation\nabove will satisfy\n\u2202\u03c4 \u0013\u03b6 = \u0013\u03ba \u2202\n2\ny \u03b6 + \u03ba\u2202\n2\ny \u0013\u03b6 + (\u2202y \u0013\u03ba)(1 + \u2202y\u03b6 ) + (\u2202y\u03ba)(\u2202y \u0013\u03b6 ). (C 2)\nNow we have from (3.12),\n\u0013Lr(p) = \u03c0\u03bck sin kp\/m, \u0013Li(p) = \u2212\u03c0\u03bck cos kp\/m, (C 3)\nand also with p \u2261my from (3.15)\n\u0013\u03ba(y) = \u2212m2|M(p)|4w(p)[\u22122(p \u2212 Lr(p))\u0013Lr(p) + 2Li(p)\u0013Li(p)], (C 4)\nwhich amounts to\n\u0013\u03ba(y) = 2\u03c0\u03bckm2|M(my)|4w(my)[(my \u2212 Lr(my)) sin ky + Li(my) cos ky]. (C 5)\nNow consider the four terms on the right-hand side of (C 2). The \ufb01rst term, say\n(C 2-i), and the fourth term (C 2-iv) are of order k only, and can be neglected in\ncomparison with terms of order k2. The second term (C 2-ii) is\n\u03ba\u22022y \u0013\u03b6 = \u2212\u03bck2\u03ba sin ky, (C 6)\nwhich is the usual di\ufb00usion of the perturbation, while the third term (C 2-iii) involves\nthe leading, order k2 quantity\n\u2202y \u0013\u03ba \r 2\u03c0\u03bck2m2|M(my)|4w(my)[(my \u2212 Lr(my)) cos ky \u2212 Li(my) sin ky]. (C 7)\nNow plainly the cos ky term here gives wave motion, but the sin ky term can give\ngrowth or decay. Combining terms from (C 2-ii) and (C 2-iii) gives the (real) growth\nrate of the mode as\n\u03b3 = \u2212k2\u03ba \u2212 2\u03c0k2m2|M(my)|4w(my)Li(my)(1 + \u2202y\u03b6 ). (C 8)\nUsing the de\ufb01nition of \u03ba from (3.15) and Li from (3.12), this can \ufb01nally be written in\nthe form\n\u03b3 (y) =\n\u03ba(y)2k2\nm2w(my)\n[Li(my)\n2 \u2212 (my \u2212 Lr(my))2]. (C 9)\nThus we have a highly unstable behaviour, with wavenumber k possessing an order\nk2 growth rate if this quantity is positive, i.e. if Li is su\ufb03ciently large. For the initial\ncondition of a constant gradient \u03b6 \u2261 0 we have Lr = 0, Li = \u2212\u03c0, giving formula (3.18)\nwith ampli\ufb01cation of modes in the range |y|<\u03c0\/m. Note that while the limitations\nof such a local theory of instability are well known, the calculation is instructive as a\nsimple means to understand the behaviour seen numerically.\nREFERENCES\nBalmforth, N.
