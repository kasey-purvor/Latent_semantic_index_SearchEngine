No conidial spore production occurred at 0.99\naw in cultures of A. ochraceus and A. steynii but large numbers of spores (2.3 \u00d7107 cm2) were\nproduced by A. westerdijkiae. Optimum temperature for spore production was 0.95 aw and\n30\u00b0C for A. westerdijkiae and A. ochraceus, and 0.95 aw and 35\u00b0C for A. steynii.\nQuantification of OTA showed that optimum was produced at 0.99 aw, by A. steynii at 30\u00b0C,\nfor A. westerdijkiae at 25\u00b0C and for A. ochraceus at 20\u00b0C. As water stress was imposed (0.95\naw), the temperature for maximum OTA production changed. For example, for A. steynii and\nA. westerdijkiae this was at 35\u00b0C, for A. ochraceus, 25\u00b0C. Much less OTB was produced\nrelative to OTA, but the production followed the same pattern at all aw levels and\ntemperatures. This is the first detailed study to examine the similarities and differences in\necology of these related species in this important mycotoxigenic group.\n31. Introduction\nFrisvad et al. (2004) recently examined the Aspergillus section Circumdati and separated two\nnew ochratoxigenic species, A. westerdijkiae and A. steynii from the more commonly reported\nA. ochraceus species responsible for contamination of a wide range of foodstuffs with\nochratoxins. Indeed, since this separation was demonstrated there have been a number of\nreports of A. westerdijkiae, predominantly responsible for OTA contamination being isolated\nfrom a number of raw materials, especially coffee (Leong et al., 2007, Morello et al., 2007).\nThere have been many previous studies on the physiology of the species A. ochraceus. Ramos\net al. (1998) examined effect of water activity (aw) and temperature on two dimensional\nprofiles for growth and OTA production on barley-based media and barley grain. The impact\nof environmental factors and presence of other fungal competitors on OTA production was\nshown by Lee and Magan (2000). More recently, Pardo et al. (2006) demonstrated the non-\nnutritional specificity of A. ochraceus strains isolated from coffee. It has now become\napparent because of the study by Frisvad et al. (2004) that some of these strains examined\nmay well have been A. westerdijkiae or A. steynii.\nIt has previously been shown that aw and temperature are important criteria for understanding\nthe ecology of spoilage fungi, especially mycotoxigenic species. A significant amount of\ninformation is now available on the growth and mycotoxin profiles for many of these species\nincluding ochratoxigenic ones (Sanchis and Magan, 2004). However, practically no\ninformation is available on the similarities and differences between the species in this group\nwhich can produce ochratoxins. Furthermore, sporulation profiles of these species has not\n4been studies although this could help in determining dominant contaminant species in food\ncommodities. Sporulation has also been linked to biosynthetic pathways for mycotoxin\nproduction (Brodhagen & Keller, 2006). Thus, the objectives of this study were to examine\nrepresentative strains of the three species, A. westerdijkiae, A. steynii and A. ochraceus and\nexamine the effect of (a) interactions of water activity x temperature on growth, (b) on spore\nproduction and (c) quantify ochratoxin A and B production.\n2. Material and Methods\nFungal strains\nStrains from the new grouping of A. ochraceus (A. ochraceus IBT 11952, A. steynii IBT\n22339, IBT 23096, and A. westerdijkiae IBT 10738, IBT 23971, IBT 21991) were used in\nthese studies. For the latter two species representative strain data is presented. The strains\nwere kindly supplied by Prof. J. Frisvad (Tech. Univ. of Denmark, Lynby, Denmark).\nMedia, inoculation, incubation and assessment of growth rate\nFungal strains were subcultured before examination on Malt Extract Agar [20.0 g Malt extract\n(Difco), 2.0 g Peptone (Difco), 15.0 g Agar (Sigma)] at 25 \u00b0C in the dark. The spores were\ngently dislodged from the colony surface into suspensions of 10 ml sterile distilled water\ncontaining 0.05 % Tween-20 in 25 ml Universal bottles. Fungal spore concentration was\ndetermined using a haemocytometer and adjusted to 106 spores ml-1. This was used for\ninoculation.\nAll the strains were inoculated on Yeast Extract Sucrose (YES) medium (20.0 g l-1 Yeast\nextract, 150.0 g l -1 Sucrose, 15 g l -1 Agar) after adjusting aw levels using glycerol to 0.99,\n0.95 and 0.90 aw. Glycerol\/water solutions at these aw levels were prepared and added to the\n5medium. Media were sterilized by autoclaving at 121 \u00b0C, for 20 min. Molten cooled media\nwere poured into 9 cm Petri dishes. The same aw treatments were kept in separate\npolyethylene bags and checked using a AQUALAB \u00ae 3TE, USA for confirmation of actual\nlevels.\nThe treatment Petri plates were inoculated with 5 \u00b5l of the spore suspension and incubated at\n20, 25, 30, and 35\u00b0C. The experiments were carried out with at least three replicates pre\ntreatment and some treatments repeated. Colony diameters of replicate plates were measured\nin two directions at right angles to each other. Measurements were recorded daily during\ngrowth until the Petri plates were completed colonised (Aldred et al., 1999) and the growth\nrate was calculated by plotting the radial mycelium growth against time and the slope of the\nlinear growth phase was used to obtain the radial growth rates (mm day-1, Patriarca et al.,\n2001) .\nQuantification of conidial production\nThe strains were inoculated on YES medium overlaid with cellophane (8.5 cm, P400,\nCannings Ltd, Bristol, U.K.); this enabled the entire mycelial colony to be removed. The\ncolony was suspended in 10 ml of sterile water containing a wetting agent (Tween 80, 0.1%)\nto wet the spores (Ramos et al., 1999). Spores were collected by filtering through sterile glass\nwool, and the filtrate was centrifuged to obtain a spore pellet. The number of spores was\ndetermined per cm of colony at the end of incubation period using a haemocytometer and a\nbinocular microscope connected to a Video imaging unit (Parra et al., 2004).\nDetermination of ochratoxin A and B\nThe treatments were harvested after 8 days. Plugs (3 mm diameter) were taken across the\ndiameter of the colony using a sterile cork borer. The three plugs were placed into 2 ml\n6Eppendorf tubes and weighed. Ochratoxins were extracted by adding 1 ml HPLC grade\nmethanol and shaken for 1 hour. The mycelial residue was discarded by centrifugation. The\nextracts were filtered directly into amber HPLC vials.\nSamples were analyzed by HPLC using a 470 fluorescence detector (Millipore Waters,\nCorporation Masssachusetts USA) (\u03bbexc 333 nm, \u03bbem 460 nm) and a C 18 column (Luna\nSpherisorb ODS2 150 x 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m) all under the control of Waters Millenium 32 software.\nThe analysis was performed at a flow rate 1 ml min-1 with a mobile phase of 41 % Water: 57\n% Acetonitrile: 2 % Acetic acid and a run time of 15 minutes. A stock solution of ochratoxin\nA and ochratoxin B standard (Sigma Aldrich, Supelco) were evaporated from benzene: acetic\nacid (9:1) and diluted with methanol to analyse the OTA and OTAB using standards (50, 100,\n200, 400 and 800 ng; 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 ng respectively. The linear regressions for OTA\nconcentrations against peak height were plotted (OTA, R2=0.985; OTB, R2=0.993). The limit\nof detection for OTA was 5 ng ml-1and for OTB was 0.6 ng ml-1. The data is presented as\nlog10 OTA and OTB in the results.\nStatistical analysis\nAll experiments were carried out with 3-4 replicates and repeated. Statistical tests were\nperformed using Statistica version 8 (StatSoft, Inc, 1984-2007) for three-way ANOVA and\nLSD Fisher was determined at the 95% confidence limits.\n3. Results\nEffects of aw and temperature on growth.\nFigure 1 compares the growth of all three strains of A. ochraceus group at different aw levels\nand temperatures. This shows that at 0.95 aw, maximum growth occurred at all temperatures\n7except at 20\u00baC for all strains except for A. steynii which was at 30\u00baC and 0.99 aw. Overall, A.\nochraceus 11952 grew faster than the other two species followed by A. westerdijkiae 10738\nand A. steynii 22339 at all the temperatures and 0.95 and 0.90 aw levels examined. Statistical\nanalyses of the data sets showed that single and interacting factors for aw, temperature\ntreatments and their interactions were all significant (Table 1).\nEffects of aw and temperature on asexual sporulation of A. ochraceus strains.\nFigure 2 shows the effect of the two abiotic factors on asexual sporulation by A. ochraceus\ngroup species. Overall, A. westerdijkiae 10738 produced higher amounts of spores than the\nother two species at all aw levels and temperatures. In the absence of water stress, no conidial\nspore production occurred (0.99 aw) at all temperatures by A. ochraceus 11952 and A. steynii\n22339, while A. westerdijkiae 10738 produced spores at all temperatures except at 20 \u00b0C, with\nhighest amount at 30 \u00b0C. However, as water stress was imposed there was significantly higher\nspore production especially at 0.95 aw levels which was optimum for spore production for A.\nwesterdijkiae and A. ochraceus, and at 0.90 aw for A. steynii. A. westerdijkiae 10738 had\nmarkedly different sporulation capacities when compared to the other two strains examined.\nTable 2 shows the effect of single, two and three way interactions. Statistically significant\ndifferences were due to the single factors of temperature, aw and their interactions with\nspecies.\nEffects of aw and temperature on ochratoxin A and B production of A. ochraceus group\nspecies\nFigure 3 compares OTA production of A. ochraceus strains under different aw and\ntemperature regimes on YES medium. Overall, A. steynii 22339 produced higher amounts of\nOTA followed by A. westerdijkiae 10738 and A. ochraceus 11952 at all temperature and aw\n8levels examined. At 0.99 aw, A. steynii 22339 produced most OTA at 30\u00b0C, A. westerdijkiae\n10738 at 25\u00b0C and A. ochraceus 11952 at 20\u00b0C. As water stress was imposed (0.95 aw),\nmaxima for OTA production were observed at different temperatures. For example, for A.\nsteynii 22339 and A. westerdijkiae 10738 this was at 35\u00b0C, for A. ochraceus 11952 this was\n25\u00b0C. Table 2 also shows that there were statistically significant differences based on species,\ntemperature, aw and their interactions (Table 3). OTB production followed the same pattern at\nall aw levels and temperatures examined. However, significantly less OTB than OTA g-1\nmedium was produced, especially by the A. ochraceus strain (Figure 3b, Table 3b).\n4. Discussion\nThis is the first study comparing the influence of aw and temperature on growth, sporulation\nand ochratoxin A and B production by a new grouping of strains of the A. ochraceus group\nrepresenting three species (A. ochraceus, A. steynii and A. westerdijkiae). Maximum growth\noccurred at 0.99-0.95 aw and 30\u00b0C for all three A. ochraceus group strains were examined. A.\nochraceus has been described as a fungus which grows between 8\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, with an\noptimum at 24-30\u00b0C (ICMSF, 1996). Ramos et al. (1998) studied growth of three isolates of\nA. ochraceus on barley extract agar medium, optimal aw for growth was found at 0.98-0.96 aw\nwith temperature optima of 30\u00b0C for two isolates and 25-30\u00b0C for the other isolate and the\nhighest growth rate was at 0.95 aw.\nNo work has been carried out on sporulation of the A. ochraceus group in relation to\nphysiological factors. This is important as it may help understand which species may be\npresent in a contaminated food matrix because of the relative differences in sporulation. We\nfound that higher temperatures and water stress (0.95-0.90 aw) were more suitable for asexual\nspore production especially at 30\u00b0C for A. westerdijkiae 10738 and A. ochraceus 11952 and\n935\u00b0C for A. steynii 22339. The highest production of spores was registered by A.\nwesterdijkiae 10738 and the lowest spore production by A. ochraceus 11952. Previous studies\nby Gervais et al. (1988, 2003) with P. roquefortii strains from cheese grew optimally at 0.97-\n0.98 aw, while maximum spore production was at 0.96 aw. Parra et al. (2004) showed that the\nhighest amount of spores produced by a genetically engineered A. niger strain was at 0.95 aw\nwhen this was modified with glycerol at 35\u00b0C, and by a wild-type strain of A. niger at 0.97 aw\nand 35\u00b0C. Giorni et al. (2008) found that A. flavus produced 1.8 x 107 conidia cm2 at 0.98 aw\nand that this was reduced to practically no sporulation at 0.90 when an ionic solute was used\n(NaCl). In contrast, with a non-ionic solute (glycerol) sporulation still occurred at 0.85 aw\n(4.7x105 conidia cm2). They also showed that differences of 5\u00b0C and 0.005 aw from optimal\nconditions for A. flavus (25\u00b0C; 0.995 aw) can produce a 10-15% reduction in fungal extension,\na significant reduction in AFB1 production and sporulation (65-80% and 55% respectively).\nThese differences could be explained by results reported by Brodhagen & Keller (2006)\nregarding the regulation of both sporulation and mycotoxin production in mycotoxigenic\nfungi by G protein signalling pathways. The relationship between mycotoxin production and\nsporulation were also found by Mostafa et al. (2005) who demonstrated that most of the\ntoxins were produced after the fungus has completed its initial growth phase and began the\ndevelopment stage, represented by sporulation, and for A. flavus, sclerotial formation.\nLittle attention has been paid to the influence of incubation temperature, changes in aw on\nochratoxin A & B production by A. ochraceus strains. Maxima for OTA production were\nobserved at high water stress (0.95-0.90 aw) and high temperature 30-35\u00b0C for A. steynii\n22339 and A. westerdijkiae 10738, 25-30\u00b0C for A. ochraceus 11952. Ramos et al. (1998)\ndemonstrated that A. ochraceus strains produced the maximum amounts of OTA at the\nhighest aw treatment (0.98 aw) and 25\u201330\u00b0C on barley extract malt agar and on barley grains.\n10\nMaximum OTA accumulation on synthetic grape juice medium by two A. carbonarius strains\nisolated from grapes was obtained at 0.96 aw and 25\u00b0C ( Mitchell et al., 2004, Belli et al.,\n2004). Optimal conditions for OTA production on coffee cherries were 25\u00b0C and 0.99 aw\nusing one strain isolated from green coffee (Joosten et al., 2001). This data should be useful\nto scientists who need to differentiate between these closely related mycotoxigenic species\nand to enable effective comparisons between isolated ochratoxingenic Aspergillus species in\ndifferent food matrices.\nAcknowledgements\nA.
