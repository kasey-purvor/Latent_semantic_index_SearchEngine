This paper argues that current attacks upon the pension system are not \nnew; Since 1601 the very need for pensions has been questioned by the Right, with arguments \nusually orientated around; affordability and individual responsibility.  An historical \ncomparison shows that many of the commonly held assumptions and arguments against \npension provision are often mistaken, and in some cases highly misleading.  Discourses or \nideologies, touted in the 1940s are being re-used in the current period.  This paper identifies \nwhich arguments were misleading or false in the past, thus allowing us to see through them in \ntheir current form. \n In this paper previous tendencies driving the conceptual apparatus of laissez-faire \npolicies are re-visited, albeit with some new twists, in the guise of the neo-liberal project. \n \nPensions, Welfare State, neo-liberalism, laissez-faire, historical comparison, the third way, \ndiscourse.\n 2 \nIntroduction \nThe real and current pension crisis is relatively simple to express; not only are there currently \ntoo many people in poverty in old age; that number is set to increase if current government \nspending policies continue (Davies, 2003, 9).  The cause of the \u2018pension crisis\u2019 is debatable; \nis it simply the case that individuals are not saving enough?  Or have people been let down by \npension schemes?  Do many workers earn enough to contribute meaningfully to a pension \nfund?  In the UK the Pension Commission was established by the government in 2002 to \ninvestigate the current pension crisis.   \nThere have been two Pension Commission reports, both of which were chaired by \nLord Turner; the first report, published in February 2005 and entitled Principles for Reform: \nThe national pensions debate (PC 1 2005) outlined a number of issues connected to pension \nprovision, but did not offer much in the way of proposals for change.  A second, more \ndetailed report, therefore was commissioned.  The second report would make \nrecommendations for future government policy.  The focus of this article is the second, and \nmost recent Pension Commission report, Security in Retirement: Towards a new pension \nsystem (PC 2 2006), which will be referred throughout this article as the Turner Report, \npublished in May 2006.  This second report, whilst being different in scope to the Beveridge \nreport is similar in other aspects.  If we just look at the contribution of both reports to the field \nof pension provision, we can recognise that both the Turner and the Beveridge reports were \nconcerned with examining and recommending changes to a pension system that it was felt \nneeded reform.  Indeed, John Hill, who was a member of the Pension Commission has written \nabout how the Pension Commission compared their findings to Beveridge\u2019s, and agreed with \nsome of the key principals of the Beveridge Report (Hills, 2006, 13) \n   This article will argue that the type of reform suggested by the respective reports \nreflects the political economy of the era and climate in which they were produced.  This \narticle will suggest that the Beveridge report was produced in a climate that was open to a \nnumber of potential pension systems, and that whilst some of Beveridge\u2019s proposals were \nblocked or restricted by Treasury employees, and indeed the financial realities of post-war \nBritain, the report that was published reflected one aspect of a wider pensions discourse \u2013 a \ndiscourse that had not yet become standardised or indeed hegemonic.  It is argued however, \nthat the Turner report, which had similar objectives to Beveridge\u2019s, did not enjoy the same \ndiscursive freedom.  The Turner Report was tied to the conclusions of the first Pension \nCommission\u2019s report, and both reports seemed clearly aligned to New Labours \u2018third way\u2019.  \nThe Turner Report, for example, cherry-picks which aspects of Britain\u2019s legislative pension \nhistory is included in the report, and underplays the impact of pension mis-selling and \nemployer contribution holidays, whilst at the same time puts promotes and places an \nemphasis on greater personal responsibility.  This is important, as it suggest that a significant \n 3 \ncause of the current pension \u2018crisis\u2019 is individual reluctance to prepare for retirement, which if \ntrue, can only be partly to blame.  An emphasis on the responsibility of the individual also \nsuggests that the State is not responsible, and should not be responsible for doing this.  John \nHills article argues that the Turner Report was torn between two extremes;  \n \nAt one end, some have argued that the State\u2019s role should or can only be that of \npoverty relief. At the other, people argue that it is the state which should organise \nand provide earnings-replacement for all or nearly all (Hills, 2006, 14) \n \nIt is difficult to find evidence of this turmoil in the actual report, and significant \nrecommendations of the report, that the link with earnings for the state pension should be \nrestored, and that Personal Accounts should be created, along with the individual choice to \nopt-out represent an uncomfortable compromise.  Whether New Labour will ever restore the \nlink with earnings is still not yet certain, and if this is to happen, it will not be before 2012.   \nBeveridge was very clear that social insurance should be a relationship characterised \nby joint responsibility between citizen and state, and that so long as individuals fulfilled their \nresponsibility by working, then the state should fulfil its responsibility by providing people \nwith insurance \u2013 which is in this instance, a secure pension.  This is a sentiment that Hill has \nargued that the Pension Commission agreed with (Hills 2006, 13).  It seems, however, that \nsixty years on the commitment to this relationship of joint responsibility is being renegotiated, \nand the meaning of responsibility manipulated. \nAfter comparing the Beveridge Report, and the Turner Report, this article draws our \nattention to two basic discourses; affordability and individual responsibility.   According to \nFairclough (2003) discourses, are not just ways of representing the world, they can influence \nthe world.  What is said or written, can causally influence what we subsequently do, making \ndiscourse a potential cause of social action.  Discourse influences action by selecting and \nemphasising certain linguistic, and hence practical possibilities, whilst de-selecting, de-\nemphasising or excluding others, making these other linguistic and hence practical \npossibilities far more likely to occur.  Fairclough (2004) is careful to point out, that just \nbecause discourse can \u2018construe\u2019 the world, it does not mean that discourse can re-construct \nthe world.  Understanding discourse in this way allows us to hang onto the notion that what \nwe say, or write, about practices related to pension provision can have causal efficacy, \nwithout lapsing into the idealist trap whereby what we say or write creates or constructs these \npractices. Put simply, by selecting and emphasising certain linguistic, and hence action, \npossibilities and de-selecting, de-emphasising or excluding others, some discourses relating to \npension provision may become accepted true \u2013 even if they are false (Fleetwood, 2005, 200). \n This paper compares and contrasts discourses of affordability, and individual \nresponsibility between the 1940s and today. It demonstrates how different contributors to the \n 4 \npension debate, select and emphasise certain discourses whilst de-selecting, de-emphasising \nor excluding others, making these other discourses and, thereby, practical, possibilities far \nmore likely to occur.  In so doing, it reveals that reports such as Turner\u2019s and Beveridge\u2019s are \nmore than large tomes that gather dust on library shelves: they contribute to the political \nclimate in which pension provision is carried out, making them an important factor in the \neconomics and politics of the contemporary pension crisis. \nIt is necessary to briefly describing what is unique about the current neoliberal period, \nas whilst there are numerous similarities between Thatcherism and New Labour there are also \nsome distinct differences.  These differences are the result of New Labours experimentation \nwith the \u2018third way\u2019.  In New Labour, New Language? Fairclough describes how New Labour \nhave built a new political discourse by incorporating \u2018elements of the political discourse of \nThatcherism\u2019 into their own discourse (Fairclough, 2000, 21). \nThatcher\u2019s Conservative government of the 1980s explicitly targeted those who claimed \nvarious benefits.  New Labour however, do not employ such openly aggressive discourse, \nfavouring an emphasis on encouraging people to help themselves; \u2018helping people back to \nwork, helping people off benefits, helping pensioners out of poverty\u2019.  The current discourse \nfocuses almost entirely on individual rights, and responsibilities \u2013 responsibilities which on \ncloser inspection are also emphasised in the Turner report.  Fairclough notes that this  \n \n\u2018moral discourse is combined with contractual discourse which interprets the \ndistribution of rights and responsibilities metaphorically as a contract or deal \nbetween the individual and society (the community) or the individual and the \ngovernment (Fairclough, 2000, 39).   \n \nAppeals for personal responsibility are combined with economic arguments over \npension provision affordability, regardless of whether the sums actually add up or not.  These \nmoralistic appeals that we take responsibility for ourselves, and not rely on the state are \nsoftened by traditional left-wing Labour commitments to poverty prevention, albeit with a \nmeans tested pension credit, which reinforces the contractual discourse of neoliberalism.  \nPersonal Accounts, Pension Credit and an emphasis on personal responsibility reflect, \n \n\u2018the moral and contractual discourse of New Labour as an individualist discourse, \nwhich stands in contrast with the traditional collectivism of the centre-left and the \nleft.  The \u2018deals\u2019 that are contracted are primarily envisaged as deals which \nindividuals enter into, the \u2018responsibilities\u2019 and \u2018duties\u2019 are primarily those of \nindividuals.  New Labour has abandoned even a residual orientation to collectivism \nand to social class\u2019.  (Fairclough, 2000, 40) \n \nThe unquestioning acceptance of these individual contracts and responsibilities is what \ncurrent proposed pension reform is based on.  It is based on the assumption that everyone is \nable to provide for their own retirement, without an investigation into individual \n 5 \ncircumstances.  It encourages people to think individualistically, as opposed to the \ncollectively.  Social security was a form of insurance that one could, if necessary, claim for a \nlimited period, or in certain circumstances, indefinitely.  It was not vilified as a crutch for \nthose who do not want to work, as opposed to cannot.  This new neoliberal notion of \nresponsible social security, however, seems only to go one way.  For instance, in the Turner \nReport, the lack of responsibility the Thatcher government displayed when it encouraged \nmillions to opt-out of SERPS and then were mis-sold private pension schemes is underplayed.  \nDespite this, the discourse of responsibility seems to be an enduring and captivating one.  \nThis article aims to demonstrate that neoliberal discourse, characterised initially by \nThatcherism, and most recently by New Labour\u2019s \u2018third way\u2019, has become naturalised and \nhegemonic.  It is no longer a competing discourse, but rather the discourse.  To deviate from \nit is seen as illogical, and uneconomical.  Discussing the dominance of neoliberalism \ndiscourse Henk Overbeek comments that, \n \n\u2018Untrammelled international competition, the celebration of the market, or wealth \nand self, anti-communism and anti-unionism; all these are no longer propagated as \n\u2018revolutionary\u2019 in a sense of challenging a prevailing consensus of a different \ncontent, but they are now part of normal every day discourse, self-evident, near \nimpossible to contradict or even doubt.  History conceived as struggle of ideologies \nhas come to an end as Fukuyama (1989) would have it \u2026 Its (neoliberalism) \nvictory means that its radical tenets have themselves become the new \u2018normalcy\u2019. \n(Overbeek, 1993, 1-2) \n \nIt is this normalcy that this article is concerned with identifying and presenting. \nThe methodology used to interpret the documents used in this article have been \ninformed by a broadly realist perspective.  The figures used in any discussion of the pension \ncrisis are a form of discourse, as are the government documents that have been used, and \ndiscourses are not always true: they can differ from, or fail to express, practices.  This article \nwill demonstrate that discourses that are false (ideologies) are being re-used.  They were false \nin the past, and looking at them again allows us to question the truth of their current versions.   \nThis article is historically comparative, and as such it draws on documentary evidence \nfrom the National Archive (NA) and a range of official governments publications.  Whilst \ngovernment documents are generated for a specific purpose, the comprehensiveness of the \nBeveridge Report means that the NA contains not only official government views but those of \ncontributors who had a vested interest.  The proposals of the Beveridge Report were \nsomewhat controversial and had various implications for different departments.  As a result \nmaterial exists that gives a genuine insight to the opinions of those involved.  Furthermore, \neven official documents are supplemented by the comments and marginalia of various \nofficials who considered them \u2013 as such a clear view of what was intended can be discerned. \n 6 \nCurrent such government documents are not available; therefore I am forced to rely \non publications such as the Turner Report and government White Papers.  It is more difficult \nto gage political opinion on such matters due to the efficient operations of Party spin \nmachines.  It was only from comparing different historical eras to the present that one is able \nto accurately identify the enduring discourses.  Though it may be perceived that this article is \nselective about the discourses it presents, and this could be a criticism of the theories being \nput forward, the research undertaken was done so in the spirit of good historical research, to \nuncover, and to present; not to mislead.  It was with this in mind, that the article was written. \n \nAffordability \nBetween 1946 and today, there has been something of a rough and ready all-party consensus \nthat pension provision is affordable.  It is important, there fore, to examine the arguments that \nhave led to a significant change in this belief that survived despite the introduction of the \nBSP, and often cite affordability as the main obstacle.  Neoclassical economists (and policy \nmakers inspired by these economists) believe, and argue that the best way to secure decent \npensions provision is via the free market: everyone should have an individual private pension \nplans \u2013 restricting the need and scope for state provision.  Blackburn (Blackburn, 2002, 431) \nsuggests that it was only the \u2018experience of war time collectivism\u2019 that provided the \ninspiration for a universal pension which amongst other factors, is probably true  Individuals \nand their families were responsible for saving privately for old age \u2013 a sentiment that remains \ntoday.  Encapsulated in this view of affordability is the idea that offering any form of welfare \nwill discourage thrift and saving. Affordability, and discouraging saving are, however, \nseparate arguments, but the latter is often used to support the former.  This section, then, will \ndeal with two themes, present in a discussion of both past and current \u2013 first, the question of \nwhether pensions are actually unaffordable; second, whether current discourse presents \npensions as being unaffordable.  The former refers to how economic concerns are raised to \nobject to plans for universal pension coverage, whilst the latter refers to how the discourse of \nwhat is, and what is not, affordable restricts what is even considered in relation to pension \nprovision (and how due to a lack of any alternative discourses the scope of what can be \nconsidered is becoming ever decreasing. \n \n1.1 The discourse of affordability \u2013 past \nThe outbreak of World War Two had, naturally suspended a planned debate on pension \nreform.  Rising poverty, and protests from both the TUC and the Scottish Minister for Health \nhad meant that in 1940 pensions reform could not be ignored any longer, causing the \nChancellor of the Exchequer to present a memorandum that claimed that \u2018since the Poor Law \nwas established in this country the aged and infirm have ultimately been a charge on local \n 7 \nresources\u2019,1\n Nevertheless the issue of pension and welfare provision more generally remained an \nimpassioned public issue and the Beveridge Report was commission two years later.  The \nquarrel of the Chancellor of the Exchequer with pension provision resurfaced not only in the \ndrafting stages of the report, but during the discussions of numerous committees that followed \nit.  It was felt that a universal pension would equate to a free meal ticket for every idle man in \nBritain, and would discourage thrift, making a pension system unaffordable, as it would be \nsupporting everyone.   \n and therefore are not the responsibility of government.  Government could not \nafford to have this \u2018charge\u2019 transferred to them, particularly during wartime.  The dominant \ninference of the memorandum was a recognition that to provide for the elderly, even at the \nbelow subsistence level that the Poor Law did would be too costly.  Government did not want \nto pay for a central Poor Law and were certainly not going to support a system of welfare \nprovision which would be even more costly.   \nThe financial practicalities of the Beveridge Report were decided by the committee \n(set up to discuss the report) before any evidence of the affordability was actually presented.  \nIn his 1940 memorandum the Chancellor of the Exchequer had referred to correspondence he \nhad received from the British Employers\u2019 Confederation who recommend,  \n \nhusbanding our financial resources for the successful prosecution of the war, and \nthat if government lent its support to any flat rate increase, however paid for, \nirrespective of need, it cannot fail to create the impression that this country can \nafford to dissipate its income on non-essential purposes without thereby \nendangering the country\u2019s security \u2013 an impression which must inevitably \nencourage wage claims by workers actually at work, and undo a large part of the \neducational work regarding the dangers of inflation which the chancellors speeches \nwere designed to achieve.2\n \n \nWartime collectivism was exploited by those who simply did not want to see an \nintroduction of a universal pension under any circumstances.  In this respect, the war provided \na political and economical distraction \u2013 and those who continued to campaign over pensions \nwere in some way hindering the war effort by making government focus on \u2018non-essential \npurposes\u2019.  \n One of the main concerns over the affordability of Beveridge\u2019s proposals was that \nessentially it was a plan to redistribute some of the nation\u2019s wealth.  Beveridge felt that \n\u2018taxation means the richer man, because of his capacity to pay, pays more for the general \npurposes of the community.  These general purposes may, and in practice they must, include \nbearing a part of the cost of social security\u2019 (Beveridge, 1942, 108).  According to \nBeveridge\u2019s plan there would be permanent contribution to the pension\u2019s scheme from direct \ntaxation.  This would mean that for the first time, money, generated through taxation, would \nbe directed into the purses of the less wealthy; it would not be received from assistance \n 8 \nboards or through the Poor Law.  Naturally, the capitalist class would resist such a scheme at \nall costs, and advance political, economic, and patriotic arguments to support why they are \nunaffordable \u2013 but the political tide was starting to turn against them.  Given the climate \nproduced by World War Two, which forced conscripted men to fight, for the moment, at \nleast, arguments against pension provision based on unaffordability discourse were shelved.   \n Despite numerous protestations to the contrary, according to all the projections from \nthe Government Actuary Department (Beveridge, 1942, 173-21) it was considered that the \nplan for universal pension coverage was affordable.3  Those within the Treasury and the \nInternational Labour office (including Lord Keynes), however still felt that Beveridge\u2019s plan \nto provide a pension for all was unnecessary as: \u2018to set out to abolish \u2018want\u2019 where it does not \nexist is like Quixote charging the sheep and gaining an easy victory.4\nThe British Employers Confederation (BEC) never demonstrated any will to see the \nstate pension introduced, indeed government documents suggest that the BEC attempted to \ndelay the progress of the Beveridge Report by refusing to contribute when requested.  Only \nwhen it became clear the report would be published regardless of their cooperation and \ncontribution did the Confederation publish a memorandum.  Echoing earlier protestations \nmade to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1940 the BEC claimed that fighting the war effort \nwas entirely consuming for businesses; such matters should wait until the war was won. \n  The debate shifted from \nan ideological debate focussing on the question of providing a universal pensions (which the \nruling class could see was already lost), to a debate focussing on the question of affordability, \nas it was felt unnecessary to provide for all, as the financial position of old age pensioners \nshows more variation than would be found in nearly any other part of the personal insured \nfield.  This reappearance of reluctance to introduce a comprehensive scheme, despite proof of \nits affordability is still as prevalent today.  The main difference being that the current situation \nhas regressed to pre-1942, and the belief that a universal pension system is not affordable.   \nThis is despite the fact that businesses, and those involved in the BEC, on the whole, \nwere financially better off post World War Two than before it.  It is questionable, therefore, to \nwhat extent employers could not afford the increased contributions a universal pension would \nentail \u2013 using the war as an easy scapegoat.  The Confederation maintained that the economy \ncould not afford increased pension provision stressing that such a plan would prompt a return \nto the depression and unemployment of the 1930s claiming that,  \n \nWe are convinced [the BEC] that this colossal expenditure on social security (at \nthat time \u00a3400 million per year) is far greater than this country can afford; the \nfinancial burdens it places on industry are, in no small measure accountable for our \ndepression, and that this country, in concentrating on insuring its people against all \nthe risks of life, has in large measure deprived them of employment, which is the \ngreatest security of all.5\n \n \n 9 \nThe Confederation did not provide any evidence in their memorandum to support the \nclaim that social security spending caused the Depression of the 1930s, and it would appear \nthat the Treasury did not treat it very seriously as eventually it was admitted that despite many \nobjections from opponents, or political will against reform, some of Beveridge\u2019s proposals \nwould have to be adopted.  As Wilfred Eady conceded \u2018that the political and economic \nbackground immediately after the war may need something on these lines to reduce the field \nof internal controversy\u2019.6\n \n  Offering post-war concessions would hopefully keep political \nagitators silent, and keep revolutionaries and other militant factions, especially the \nCommunists within the Trade Union movement on the periphery.   \n1.2 The discourse of affordability \u2013 present \nWe are told by economists that pension provision is an escalating cost of developed countries \ndue to enjoying an ageing population.  This is, undoubtedly true, as: \n \nThe direct costs to public expenditure attributed to people aged 65 and over were \nestimated at \u00a38.4 million for health care and \u00a32.8 million for social service \n(England and Wales) in 1989-90; \u00a323.8 million for state pensions (Great Britain) in \n1990-91.  By far the greatest cost is that of pensions. (Thane, 2002, 481).  \n \nIt is not the intention of this paper to paint this as some political myth \u2013 pension provision is \nexpensive.  What is under question at the moment is whether or not it is affordable.  Recent \nreports about the future of the welfare state and pension provision request major changes due \nto the unaffordability of the scheme, despite the fact that, \n \nThe distribution of costs and the total pensions cost is likely to remain stable until \nc.2020 since the total population of pensionable age is expected to be stable, unless \nthere is a significant rise in state pension expenditure, or a significant shift in \npriorities for welfare spending, of which there was little sign in the late 1990s in \nthe political statements of either main political parties. (Thane, 2002, 481) \n \nIt appears therefore, that agitation over the affordability of pensions is connected to political \nwill, rather than strict economic logic.  Current political decisions are being made about the \nextent to which the cost of pensions should fall upon the individual or upon public \nexpenditure \u2013 the affordability of universal pensions, and the strain on the taxpayer, is just \none of the factors affecting this debate.  The real factor is as relevant now as it was in 1946 \u2013 \nthe discourse of affordability.  By restricting the terms of the debate, the discourse of \naffordability restricts what is considered, what can be said and, therefore, influences what can \nbe done.  To a certain extent the Beveridge reflected this, and the Turner Report currently \ndemonstrates this. \n 10 \n The New Labour lexicon tends to avoid directly discussing the details in reference to \naffordability.  Rather, there is much made of lifting the poorest out of poverty, and hence, \nhighlighting the benefits of maintaining the means test: \n \n\u2018Our changes to the state pension system since 1997 have been essential to tackle \nthe immediate problems that we found, and, as we have set out, they have been \nvery successful. Incentives to save in the current system remain strong. Recent \nresearch has shown that incentives for many on low incomes have improved as a \ndirect result of the introduction of Pension Credit\u2019. (PC 2, 13) \n \nRather than having a debate about affordability, the discourse focuses on targeting resources, \nand helping those that are most in need.  It becomes difficult to criticise these arguments \nwithout ultimately criticising the whole of New Labour\u2019s welfare strategy, as it relies on this \nprinciple.  Be that fuel allowance, or pension credit \u2013 the aim is to help the poorest.  So by \nfocusing the debate on the poorest, the discourse prevents it from moving onto a more \nthorough discussion of how much GDP we should spend on pensions \u2013 indeed, this is not \ndebated, despite being a logical discussion to have.  \n A further example can be found in John Hutton\u2019s introduction to the report, where he \ncomments: \n \n\u2018Protecting the poorest \u2013 we are committed to uprating the Guarantee Credit for \npensions in line with earning growth.  This means the value of the \u00a31145 \nguaranteed minimum income for single pensioners today will keep in pace with the \ngrowth in national wealth\u2019. (PC 2, 22) \n \nThis is not a commitment to eradicating pensioner poverty, just managing it.  It is the \nendurance of the means test that highlights affordability as a hegemonic pension discourse, \nand whilst the focus of the debate has shifted slightly, the message is still the same as when it \nwas falsely touted in the 1940s \u2013 pensions are not affordable. \nIn 1942 Beveridge set out an affordable plan for universal pension provision; in 1946 \nAtlee cherry-picked from the plan.  Gordon Brown in his previous capacity as the Chancellor \nof the Exchequer, and now as Prime Minister is guilty of doing the same.  The Turner Report \nshares some similarities with the Beveridge Report, though it is probably fair to say that the \nremit of the Turner Report was more greatly controlled \u2013 for example despite Turner\u2019s \nenthusiasm to see the link between the state pension and earnings renewed, it has been \npostponed until 2012, reportedly at the behest of Brown.  Turner has also recommended \nraising the retirement age due to higher life expectancy figures.  This is however, in the \nshadow of a government (and sections of business) who are reluctant to raise the retirement \nage. \nAs noted already, due to both their importance for a minimum of financial security in \nold age, and their general popularity with the voting public, pension are not going away (yet), \n 11 \ntherefore, the perceived unnecessary cost of providing a pension to those who do not require \nthe money \u2013 wasting money on already wealthy pensioners \u2013 is being renegotiated.  The \nMinimum Income Guarantee (MIG) was introduced so that supplementary benefits could \neasily be targeted at the poorest of pensioners and designed to bring them above the poverty \nthreshold.  This would help the government reach its targets, without having to consider a \nwhole scale rise in pension payments \u2013 which pleases the Treasury, many (but not all) tax \npayers, and keeps political opponents silent, and more importantly, does not evoke negative \ndiscourse associated with \u2018means-testing\u2019. \n The preoccupation with not becoming a Santa Clause state \u2013 something for nothing (a \nconcern as relevant to Beveridge as Turner) \u2013 has, however, led to a nothing for something \nstate pension system which is currently not rewarding large proportions of citizens who have \nworked \u2013 in particular, women.  In short, it would appear that since the 1930s little has \nchanged for the poorest of pensioners, as they are still dependent on supplementary benefits \u2013 \nand to our shame, the poorest of these elderly are still women.  Due to the nature of the \ntraditional caring role of women in society they receive irregular records of employment, and \ncontribute less to national insurance, currently resulting in below subsistence pensions \n(Thane, 2006a).  The prevention of this scenario was the main reason why Beveridge insisted \nthat all citizens should receive as subsistence level pension, and that widows should receive \nparticular attention during any pension reform. \n The government now is proposing a \u2018New Deal\u2019 for female pensioners, who are set to \nsuffer the longest whilst delays continue in restoring the earnings link to the BSP, as even a \nreduction in the number of years required contributions will take along time to benefit all \nwomen.  It is also unknown what impact the government\u2019s aim to get 50 per cent of the \npopulation into university will have upon pension provision, national insurance contributions, \nand retirement age \u2013 as the age for entering the labour market becomes roughly 21\/22 years \nold, rather than 16. \n Regardless of some noble proposals for pensions, Lord Turner has written within the \nLabour Government\u2019s discourse of affordability; matching his proposals very closely to the \n\u2018fiscal and political difficulties of financing pensions\u2019 (Thane, 2006b) that the government \nclaims it faces.  In some ways it would have been impossible for Lord Turner to have \nproduced anything else.  In the 1940s there were many competing discourses, and not one \noverarching hegemonic discourse; as neoliberalism is now.  In many ways, anything was \npossible.  This is simply not true of the current situation, as quite often we are led to believe \nthe discourse of TINA; there is no alternative.  Even the TUC General Secretary Brendan \nBarber is supporting government reforms to the pension system, commenting on the subject \nof the proposed \u2018Personal Accounts\u2019: \u2018while it is right to examine the position of the low paid, \ncritics of the new scheme fail to see that most people would rather build up their own pension \n 12 \npot, rather than rely on the future vagaries of state pension benefits\u2019 (Labour Research \nDepartment, 2007).  This discourse which, as noted above not only supports the view fostered \nduring the 1980s that state saving is somehow negative \u2013 a bad way to save \u2013 and that a \ngreater return can be found in the private sector, but also reverses the polarities on state and \nprivate pensions and refers to state pensions as having future vagaries, but not private \npensions, which are rooted in the real vagaries of the stock market. \n \n1.3  Summary \n Current opposition to improvements in the pension system and opposition to the very \nintroduction of a universal pension system in the 1940s on the grounds of affordability are \ncouched in very similar discourse.  Indeed, they are so similar it is difficult not to see \nsystematic political social and economical forces at work. \nThe Beveridge Report proposed major changes not only to pension provision, but \nsocial security as a whole.  The welcome given to the Beveridge Report was \u2018that of a still \nlargely impoverished working class, with memories of still greater, recent, misery and with \nlow expectations of how their living standards might rise\u2019 (Thane, 2002, 368).  There was a \nsense of public elation surrounding Beveridge\u2019s proposals, which gave people hope of a better \nlife after the war, and strong consistent opposition from the Conservative party who regarded \n\u2018Beveridge\u2019s proposals as genuinely undesirable\u2019 (Thane, 2002, 368).  The threat of a \nrevolution after World War Two was a very real fear for the government \u2013 the \u2018spectre of \ncommunism\u2019 was crucial in shaping political-economy of the period after World War Two.  \nThe threat from Bolshevism was real and the ruling class were worried that the aftermath of \nWorld War Two would see the rise of \u2018communism\u2019 (more appropriately, Stalinism) in \nEurope and the UK.  Added to this the working class were organised, militant, capable of \nmilitary fighting, and had ideological support from the fact that capitalism was tainted with \nfascism and \u2018communism\u2019 appeared to have the higher moral ground.  This situation led to \nconcessions being given (in the form of welfare) that might otherwise not have. \n   \nResponsibility \nThe question of who bears the responsibility to provide welfare provision is a long standing \ndebate.  The Beveridge Report appealed to a notion of joint responsibility; that every \nindividual, completing work within their power, should be guaranteed at least a subsistence \nretirement income \u2013 as it was the State\u2019s responsibility to rid society of want \u2013 one of the \n\u2018Five Giants\u2019.7\n In more recent years this perceived responsibility to provide a pension on retirement \nhas been questioned.  This paper has already examined the changing nature of affordability of \nthe state pension and given an alternative analysis of the nature and impact of an ageing \n \n 13 \npopulation.  This Section will seek to address the changing representations, discourse, and \nnature, of responsibility, from the early twentieth century, to the early twenty-first century.  It \nwill analyse the political, ideological, and economical factors affecting change. \n \n2.1 The Discourse of Responsibility \u2013 past  \nBefore the introduction of the Welfare State it had very much been the case that individuals \nand their families were responsible for saving privately for old age; the state it was argued \ncould not and should not adopt responsibility to provide this. \n This view of pension provision (and welfare as a whole) was popular amongst \nConservative political circles at the time of the writing of the Beveridge Report \u2013 who formed \nthe bulk of the war-time coalition government.  It was strongly believed by many on the right \n(and still is) that the primary objective of welfare was poverty relief \u2013 nothing more.  Any \nuniversal pension would be directing money were it was not required, or where there was not \npoverty.  Beveridge recognised the obstacles facing comprehensive welfare provision and \ncommented that, it would be down to British citizens to fight for universal social security: \n \n\u2018Freedom from want cannot be forced on a democracy or given to a democracy.  It \nmust be won by them.  Winning it needs courage and faith and a sense of national \nunity; courage to face the facts and difficulties and overcome them; faith in our \nfuture and in the ideals of fair-play and freedom for which century after century our \nforefathers were prepared to die\u2019. (Beveridge, 1942, 172)  \n \nBeveridge, an experienced politician and Liberal peer predicted the difficulties his plan \nwould face, and was familiar with the types of arguments that would be used to counter it.  \nNone of Beveridge\u2019s proposals were new per se, but it was the first time they had ever been \nincluded in such a comprehensive document.  Anti-welfare discourse and sentiments \npersisted, and in the 1950s the Conservative party released a document stating, \n \n\u2018The Conservative Party does not regard the true function of the social services to \nbe either the provision of an average standard or the redistribution of wealth.  It \napproves the historic function of the social services as the relief of the unfortunate \nfrom misfortune, of the sick from ill-health, of the needy from distress (Thane \n2002, 371)\u2019. \n \nThe Beveridge Report had challenged these principles of welfare; however, \nopposition never disappeared, resurfacing in the 1950s, 60s, 70s, and again in the 1980s, \nwhen the neoliberal discourse relating to pension reform, started to become hegemonic.  The \nabove quotation merely highlights that this type of rhetoric has never left the political lexicon \nof the right (it was just not always stressed). \n \n2.2 The Discourse of Responsibility \u2013 present \n 14 \nThroughout Margaret Thatcher\u2019s leadership the Conservative government never displayed a \ncoherent approach to welfare provision.  A formal abandonment of the full employment goal \nappears to have been a precaution against political failure considering the large losses in \nmanufacturing jobs during the 1981-82 recession.   \n Further attempts to distance government from the responsibility of providing \npensions is evident in the implicit privatisation of SERPS (Pierson, 1994) and the introduction \nof personal pension schemes which were a major welfare innovation of the Conservative \nParty \u2013 these pensions have since been discredited by the mis-selling scandal, which saw \npeople persuaded to leave their occupational scheme for the (as it turned out, false) promise \nof a better returns.  It is possible now to see that during the 1980\u2019s the future of welfare in \nBritain and the state\u2019s relationship to it underwent a re-examination.  As did the discourse \nused to describe welfare; the homeless became rough sleepers.  Claiming benefits, or using \nthe service of the welfare state became refashioned to be something one should be shamed of, \nrather than celebrating, as a generation previously had done.  It was also during this period \nthat services provided by the state came to be regarded as second class services. \nThe state abandoned any ideological responsibility to provide welfare, and encouraged \nprivate citizens to view those that accepted welfare in a negative way.  In September 1983 for \nan interview with Woman\u2019s Own Margaret Thatcher declared,  \n \n\u2018I think we have gone through a period when too many children and people have \nbeen given to understand \u201cI have a problem, it is the Government\u2019s job to cope \nwith it\u201d\u2026 \u201cI am homeless, the Government must house me!\u201d  And so are casting \ntheir problems on society, and who is society?  There is no such thing! \u2026 I think, \none of the tragedies \u2026 that many of the benefits which were meant to help people \nwho were unfortunate, somehow there are some people who have been \nmanipulating the system\u2019. (Sunday Times, 1987, 8-10). \n \n The earliest welfare provision, the Relief for the Poor 1601, was born out of a \nChristian belief that we should take care of those that are less fortunate, that the wealthy have \nan obligation to provide for the poor \u2013 over the last twenty years in Britain the dominant \ndiscourse espouses that those less fortunate are to blame for their position, and do not deserve \nhelp.  Our moral responsibility to society and commitment to a better world has been eroded, \naided and abetted by a powerful leader who promoted a discourse based on the sovereignty of \nthe free market, and the promotion of individual obligation and entitlement, above all else, \nand above all others.  It is now accepted, in many quarters, that it was not prudent in \ncontributing to a state welfare scheme, not only because it was presented as only benefiting \nthe lazy, but also because the money would be better spent in the private sector.  This has \nsince proved to be a false discourse, however, the above comment from Brendan Barber \ndemonstrates how this myth is still being peddled, not just by politicians, but by trade \nunionists. \n 15 \n The interview Mrs. Thatcher gave to Sunday Times however marked the beginning of \na sustained attempt by her government to weaken working class communities.  Thatcher \ncreated a stigma around claiming benefits such as unemployment benefit \u2013 re-branded as Job \nSeekers Allowance (notice the discourse of personal choice) \u2013 that still exists today.  People \nare not claiming what they are rightfully entitled to from an insurance scheme, as Beveridge \nenvisaged it; they are being a temporary drain on national resources.  This discourse targeted \nat benefit claimants has not gone away, and only grown stronger.  Powell examines the \nexistence of \u2018DIY\u2019 welfare, where people are urged to become more responsible and make \nprovisions for the risks that they and their families face.  However, the private pensions mis-\nselling scandal and the Maxwell pensions fund scandal, let alone the Conservatives changing \nthe rules of SERPS and New Labour taxing pension credits make DIY welfare a risky \nbusiness\u2019 (Pierson, 1994, 289) that any rational person would chose to avoid.    \nIn contrast to the Beveridge Report, the Turner Report suggests action on the pension \ncrisis on a technical, rather than moral basis.  Lord Turner claims action is needed as the \nfuture for pensioners without any reform is \u2018undesirable\u2019 (PC 1, 2004).  Lord Turner does not \ncriticise this potential outcome, in the way that Beveridge criticised the existence of want in \nthe 1940s; though the Turner report does note that this would be an undesirable option (PC 1, \n2005).  This is not a commitment to pension from a sense of responsibility \u2013 it is a technical \nfix, and the discourse reflects this.  Emotive discussions about pension provision could lead to \nall manner of outrageous calls, such as higher taxes and are, therefore avoided.  The \ngovernment is simply realising, and reacting to the fact that something will have to be done to \nprevent poverty in old age \u2013 much like the original Poor Law.  Since the 1980s the UK has \ndropped to the bottom of the international league of developed countries for state pension \nprovision (Churchill and Mitchell, 2005, 6).  The abolition of the link to earnings meant that \nin 1997 the UK BSP had become one of the lowest in the EU, worth less than 15 per cent of \naverage earnings; it is set to decline further.  The Turner report, therefore suggests proposals \nbased on the requirement to do something, rather than right thing; in this way it is not \ncomparable to the Beveridge report.  This can be seen in the following extract from the \nTurner Report: \n \n\u2018we need to be clear that individuals must be responsible for their own plans for \nretirement.  The reforms will ensure the provision of high-quality saving vehicles, \nand a solid state foundation to private savings.  But the choice of how much to \nsave, the level of risk to take with investments, and how long to work must be \navailable to the individual.  That provides the right balance of choice and support \nfor individual responsibility. (PC 2, 2006, 22). \n \nThis particular notion of responsibility is a uniquely New Labour one.  There are no \nmention of the facts and figures, merely a lot of rhetoric and discourse aimed at conveying a \n 16 \nsentiment surrounding saving that we should all follow.  The New Labour discourse \ntransforms pension savings into a lifestyle choice; suggesting that if people do not save \nenough it is automatically their fault, through negligence.  Taking individual responsibility is \nnot the key issue here, as ultimately most individuals already do this.  It is the message that \naccompanies such statements which is significant.  The insistence that individuals \u2018must\u2019 be \nresponsible, and that with this responsibility individuals have a \u2018choice\u2019 of how much to save.  \nFor the majority, there is not much of a choice; people save what they can.  Those with few \npension savings are generally those from low income groups who have little extra income to \nsave, whereas the suggestion in this quotation is that there are significant numbers of people \nwith expendable income simply choosing not to save. \nThere is little mention of the reciprocal responsibility of the government to provide \nindividuals with simple advice, with good regulatory legislation that stops the private sector \nmiss-selling pensions.  Rather the world responsibility takes on a new meaning \u2013 an extra \ndimension.  By using responsibility in this way, the report seems to suggest that currently \npeople are not taking responsibility and are relying on the state, and\/or others.  There are no \nmentions in the report the low levels of trust that impact of the Maxwell scandal and the mis-\nselling of private pensions has had, or the impact of employer contribution holidays and the \nclosing of occupational pension schemes.  Responsibility is a two way relationship, and not \nhaving a significant retirement income does not necessarily correlate with being irresponsible, \nin the simplistic way that the Turner report suggests.  Often, despite a complete and consistent \nworking life, low-wage earners retire reliant solely on modest personal savings, and the state \npension.  This does not mean they are not responsible individuals, or indeed deserve \npunishing or scapegoating.   \n \n2.3 Summary \nThe changing discourse over whether it is the responsibility of the state, or the individual to \nprovide a retirement income has perhaps being the discourse that has altered most \ndramatically.  Considering the failure of private, stock-market dependent schemes to provide \nconsistent pensions they are still promoted as the future of pension provision.  Why?  Simply, \nbecause there are no alternative discourses out there.  The neo-liberal discourse of the market \nand the success of Thatcherite and New Labour discourse in replacing the collective discourse \nof Beveridge, has meant that people believe this is the best way, as it is presented as the only \nway.  The state pension has been rundown so much, both in an economic practical sense, and \na discursive one, that it hardly seems worth saving. \nThe Turner Report provides a clear example of New Labours \u2018third way\u2019 political \ndiscourse.  It includes discourse traditionally associated with Labour values; \u2018tackling \npensioner poverty\u2019, \u2018implementing fair reform\u2019, but it also includes discourse that is \n 17 \nreminiscent of Thatcherism; \u2018policies must promote greater personal responsibility, \n\u2018modernisation of the welfare state\u2019.  The mixing of these discourses and messages is what \nhas been so distinctive about New Labour, and in particular Tony Blair; but Blair is no longer \nPrime Minister and the same discourse continues to pervade.  This is the political discourse of \nBritish neoliberalism. \n Beveridge\u2019s 1942 report contributed towards a political consensus and a post-war \ndiscourse in relation to welfare.  At the time of writing the report, however, this consensus \nwas not present, and there was still no certainty when the Second World War would end.  \nThere were competing discourses concerning welfare provision, and pension provision more \nspecifically, but immediately after the end of the war these were either sidelined or \nsuppressed.  It did not take long however, for the same old counter-universal pension \nprovision discourses to reappear, as they have done a certain historical points.  The notable \ndifference with the Turner report is that it does not explore an alternative discourse, and \nindeed do not acknowledge that such a discourse exists. \n \nConclusion \nThis article has highlighted that despite serious opposition to the state pension there was \nnever any serious challenge to the system.  This meant that critics of the pension system were \nleft with little option other than to (begrudgingly) accept the universal system, and strive to \nkeep payments as low as possible, and funded as little as possible from general taxation as \npossible. \n Since the 1970s, however, there have been moves to renegotiate the \u2018terms\u2019 of the \npost-war settlement.  The discourse of an overburdened state firmly took hold, leading to the \ncurrent situation where the post-war settlement is not just up for renegotiation, but has been \nmetaphorically \u2018ripped up\u2019.  As mentioned above, in his 1942 report Beveridge noted that: \n\u2018Freedom from want cannot be forced on a democracy or given to a democracy, it must be \nwon by them\u2019 (Beveridge, 1942, 172).  The Beveridge Report was a landmark in social \nsecurity reform and provided the basis for the current welfare state.  It is obvious now, \nhowever, that despite significant improvements in social security provision in the UK over the \npast fifty years, significant social problems, however still remain.  This article has suggested \nthat perceived and commonly held assumptions about problems associated with pension \nprovision still remain due to lack of political will and the enduring class structures of a \ncapitalist society \u2013 rather than pension provision being an unsolvable puzzle.  The last century \nhas witnessed more improvements in welfare than any other century in British history, so \nthere is much to celebrate \u2013 but also much to lament. \n The UK\u2019s poorest elderly are still forced to rely on hand outs from the state, \ndetermined by demeaning and extensive means-testing.  The severe inequalities that exist \n 18 \nbetween rich and poor pensioners have continued.  For those in the worst scenarios, little has \nchanged since the publication of the Beveridge Report in 1942.  Beveridge recognised the \nwider political implications of his plan, as he, \n \nbelieved his proposals could only be fully effective in eliminating Want if \nsupported by a range of measures, including minimum-wage legislation, industrial \ntraining, strict price control, statutory limitation of free collective bargaining, public \nownership of land and essential services, and, if necessary, the phasing out of \nprivate ownership of most of the means of production.  Here again, even if \ntheoretically correct he was politically unrealistic.  Labour\u2019s unwillingness or \ninability to implement most of these corollaries of his Plan help to explain its \nextremely limited effects. (Thane, 2002, 371). \n \nThe Labour victory of 1945 is partially credited to the Conservative Parties reluctancy to \nintroduce many of the social security measures that Beveridge discussed, however, the \nLabour Party were not willing to fully implement them either, and passed up one of the few \nchances in British history to introduce socialist policy.  What we have been left with in \nBritain is a lot of welfare \u2018churnings\u2019, such as the income tax payer who is also claiming \nwinter fuel allowance.  This system of churning creates needless administration and \nbureaucracy.   \n \nTo say this does not dispose of matters. Suppose someone has not made adequate \nprovision for old age or periods of ill health. In a civilised, afflsuent society he or \nshe should not be left to perish in the gutter. The genuine liberal (neo or otherwise) \nshould ask: what is the minimum standard we wish to provide even for those who \nhave been improvident or unlucky in their personal affairs? (Brittan, 2004) \n \nAs noted in this article this view of welfare was abandoned in the 1980s, so that even \nthe minimum should not be provided.  The only consistent factor in the long debate over \npension provision is that the Conservative party has always attempted to defend middle to \nupper class interests by opposing changes, reform, or increases in pension provision.  It is the \nLabour Party now however, that is moving towards the Right, and proposing policy that does \nnot defend working class interests \u2013 the reason why the Labour Party was originally founded. \nIt has also been argued in this article that the state should take responsibility for the \nadministration of a public, universal, and non means-tested pension system; experiments with \nprivate secondary pensions, as opposed to state secondary pensions, has on the whole, been \ndisastrous.  Turner\u2019s proposals for a compulsory saving scheme is a noble effort to encourage \nsaving.  What is still unclear however, is exactly how Personal Accounts will be administered \nand maintained.  The state pension should function as Beveridge intended; a pension equal to \nthe average wage or at the minimum subsistence level.  Those who do not have any other \nform of superannuation or occupational pension should be encouraged to bolster their \n 19 \nretirement income with a secondary state pension that would function like SERPS.  This \nwould benefit female workers in particular, along with atypical workers, or those trapped at \nthe bottom of the labour market, stuck in short-term employment. \nFinally, this article has maintained that a universal, non means-tested pension system \nis affordable \u2013 it is the current political economy of Neoliberalism that maintains it is \nunaffordable.  The act of branding pensions as unaffordable now, suggests that they once \nwere affordable.  The issue of affordability, however has consistently been used to argue the \ncase against universal pensions, and was also used 1940s \u2013 it is, therefore, an argument that \nrefuses to go away, regardless of how affordable pensions actually are.  The agitation over the \naffordability of pensions, appears therefore, to be connected to political will, rather than strict \neconomic logic \u2013 both now, and historically.  Indeed, the arguments against pension provision \nbased on affordability both now and in the 1940s are so similar it is difficult not to see \nsystematic political social and economical forces at work. \n \nThis leaves us at a potential crossroad is pension provision; the current UK social security \nsystem is a testament to the mistakes that were made in the 1940s, and have been made since.  \nThe Turner report does not offer forward radical enough recommendations, but it is at least a \nstart.  The hope now is that Brown will eventually implement the proposals put forward in the \nTurner report.  To cherry-pick from a document already lacking in progressive proposals \nwould be a disaster for the future of pension provision, and only make, at best, minor \nalterations to the current pension system.   \n The situation for those without a secure pension, or without the means to invest in \none is only set to worsen.  Personal debt in Britain is higher than ever previously recorded and \nnew forms of debt, such as student debt is also on the increase, resulting in young people \nentering the labour market already with a lifetime of debt.  It is also highly likely that there \nwill be an insufficient amount of jobs for university graduates (Brown & Hesketh 2004).  This \nwill potentially lead to people with already large amounts of debt working in jobs that pay \nlow wages. \n It is for this reason that any changes to pension provision in the UK needs to address \nthese future concerns, rather than allowing another forty years to pass, before stumbling into \nanother crisis.  Proposals for change need to address the potential problems of the future, and \nalso help pensioners that are suffering now \u2013 not be based on false hegemonic discourses. \n  \n \n \n \n \n 20 \nReferences \n \nAge Concern (1987) Women and Pensions, London: Age Concern. \nBaldwin, S., & Falkingham, J., [eds.] (1994.), Social security and social change, Hemel \nHempstead: Harvester Wheatsheaf \nBeveridge, W., (1942) Social Insurance and Allied Services, cmd 6404, London, HMSO \nBlackburn, R., (2002) Banking on Death or, Investing in Life: the history and future of \npensions.
