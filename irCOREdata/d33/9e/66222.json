INTRODUCTION\nThe fifty-fifth item in the corpus of Plutarch\u2019s Moralia is a compilation of biographi-\ncal information on the lives of the ten canonical Attic orators. The provenance of this\nconfection is mysterious, although critics unite in denying the ascription to Plutarch\nhimself. Ziegler\u2019s description of it as \u2018sowohl durch die Nichtbeachtung des Hiats wie\ndurch die ganze Darstellungsart sich als nicht plutarchisch erweisend\u20191 is representa-\ntive of the consensus.\nThis assessment is not unfair. However, in some ways the work\u2019s interest for the\nstudent of ancient biography is enhanced rather than diminished by its dissimilarity\nto the genuine productions of its putative author. The Lives offers the opportunity\nto examine the technique and interests of a non-Plutarchan writer of bi\u00b4oi with a pre-\ncision that is hard to parallel; one can analyse the author\u2019s relationship to his sources,\nhis deployment of those sources, and the attitudes which these operations reveal.\nFor these purposes it is not crucial for us to know the real identity of our biographer,\nreferred to as [Plutarch] throughout this study for the sake of convenience. One ques-\ntion worth tackling at the outset, however, is the question of whether \u2018he\u2019 was in fact a\nnumber of people. Attempts to explain the work\u2019s glaring inconsistencies and self-\ncontradictions2 have sometimes taken the form of postulating a group of authors.\nTwo considerations are worth bearing in mind, however. The first is the brevity of\nthe work. Its contradictions are in such close proximity to each other that the collab-\noration theory simply hypothesizes several incompetent authors instead of one, which\nis not very economical. The other is the observation that collaboration on any form of\nliterary endeavour is very rarely attested in antiquity,3 while single authors of multiple\nshort lives, such as Diogenes Laertius and Philostratus, are of course amply\ndocumented.\nThis does not, of course, rule out the possibility that the Lives consist of different\nstrata of data laid down at various times by various different authors, perhaps as accre-\ntions to an original text. This hypothesis has appealed to many.4 None the less, the\nLives do, as we shall see, display certain continuing themes and interests that, if\n* I am indebted to Christopher Pelling for his numerous comments and constructive criti-\ncisms on this piece.\n1 K.

Momigliano (ed.), The Conflict between Paganism and Christianity in the Fourth\nCentury (London, 1963), 79\u201399, at 96; his assertion there that the Historia Augusta itself\nclaims to be a collaborative enterprise is refuted by R.

These con-\nsiderations do not have the force of proof, but do perhaps justify us in treating the\nLives as the work of an individual, albeit one drawing extensively upon his\npredecessors.\nIn any event, the study proposed requires a preliminary examination of the work\nand its sources. Only thus is it possible to illuminate the traditions within which\nthe author works and to note the ways in which the arrangement of data which\nFowler decries as showing \u2018little variety\u2019 and \u2018little or no distinction between mere\nanecdotes and matters of real importance\u20195 can in fact prove to be very suggestive.\nAfter this excursion into Quellenforschung, [Plutarch]\u2019s own contribution to the\nshaping of his narratives will be considered. Finally, this generalized treatment will\nbe tested through a detailed investigation of the Demosthenes, where the existence\nof a biography by the real Plutarch and an abundance of other data for comparison\nmake so precise an enquiry viable.\nII.THE BIOGRAPHER AND HIS SOURCES\nAt first sight the Lives of the Ten Orators seems to yield itself up readily to source-\ncriticism. Twenty-eight authors are explicitly cited in the course of the work.6 This\nreadiness to cite authorities so explicitly is itself suggestive, as we shall see, but it\ndoes not tell the whole story. One soon discovers that elements of the Lives which\nbear no such citational warning-signs are dependent on sources which can neverthe-\nless be traced. At 834C it is claimed that Andocides sailed with Glaucon to aid the\nCorcyreans in the run-up to the Peloponnesian War. This is most improbable, since\nthe orator Andocides would still have been a child in 433\/2.7 Moreover, an extant\ninscription suggests that Glaucon was actually accompanied by Metagenes and\nDracontides.8 However, Thucydides\u2019 account of the episode9 likewise asserts that\nan Andocides, presumably the orator\u2019s grandfather, went on the expedition.\nWhether this is the result of a lapse by Thucydides himself or of interference early\nin the transmission of the text is not germane to the present enquiry. The important\nthing is that it is at least highly probable, as Fowler notes,10 that the error in\nThucydides is the ultimate source of [Plutarch]\u2019s blunder.11\n5 H. N. Fowler, Plutarch\u2019s Moralia 10 (London, 1936), 342.\n6 The complete list of citations is as follows: Aeschines (at 840F), Antiphanes (845B),\nAristophanes (836F), Caecilius (832E, 833C, 833E, 836A, 838D, 840B), Cratinus (833B),\nCtesibios (844C), Deinarchus (843A), Demetrius of Magnes (847A), Demochares (840E),\nDemosthenes (836B, 840A, 840E, 841A, 848C), Dionysius (836A, 838D), Eratosthenes\n(847B), Hegesias of Magnes (844B), Heliodorus (849C), Hellanicus (834B), Hermippus\n(849C), Hyperides (849E), Lysias (833A), Philiscus (836C), Philochorus (846B, 847A),\nPlato the philosopher (836C), Plato the comic playwright (833C), Satyrus (847A), Strattis\n(836F), Theopompus the historian (833A), Theopompus the comic playwright (839F),\nTimocles (845B), and Xenophon (832C, 845E). Cratippus is cited at 834D, but the passage\nis probably interpolated.\n7 Since he can plausibly claim to have behaved neo\u00b4thti in 415 (Andoc. 2.7; see further\nD. Macdowell, Andokides: On the Mysteries [Oxford, 1962], 2, n. 8). The voyage is,\nhowever, consistent with [Plutarch]\u2019s belief that the orator was born in 468\/7 (835A).\n8 IG I3 364. Note that some conjectural supplementation is required, however.\n9 Thuc. 1.51.4.\n10 Fowler (n. 5), 355, n. D.\n11 Jacoby (FGrH 323a F24 notes) uses [Plutarch] to argue that the elder Andocides was\npresent. He suggests that kai` \u0001Andoki\u00b4dhv o\u0002 Lewgo\u00b4rou in Thucydides is \u2018an interpolation from\nthe Vita of Andokides, which (as Ps. Plutarch shows) knows of Andokides\u2019 participation in\nthe expedition . . . such an interpolation is easily conceivable, for the text of Thukydides was\nL . V. P ITCHER218\nOther unacknowledged debts are betrayed by similarity in wording. Dionysius of\nHalicarnassus, for example, is cited by name only twice in the text. However, the\nexactness with which [Plutarch] echoes some passages of Dionysius is too great to\nbe the result of coincidence. The description of Lysias\u2019 education furnishes a good\nexample.12 In similar vein, Ofenloch argued for numerous unacknowledged borrow-\nings from Caecilius.13\nSo much is unsurprising. A further query then presents itself. How much of this\nimpressive plethora of sources has our author actually read? Is it possible to\ndiscern cases where the author\u2019s erudition, such as it is, is demonstrably borrowed?\nSome have attempted to bypass this problem by postulating a single preceding work\nof which the extant Lives is a very careless and superficial summary, a \u2018history\u2019 also\nplagiarized in a later form by Photius to put together codices 259\u201368 of the\nBibliotheca.14 It will be noted that such a hypothesis, even if it were true, would\nnot go far towards accounting for the curious characteristics of the Lives, since it\nmerely creates the problem of explaining the curious characteristics of the Ur-Lives\nfrom which they are supposed to derive. A more pressing problem, however, lies in\ntesting this sort of proposition in the first place. By what criteria is it possible to deter-\nmine whether references to earlier authors have been ransacked from a preceding\nbiographer?\nOne tempting line of attack would use the errors and omissions detectable in the\nLives that would have been rectified through judicious use of the full texts of the\nauthors so airily cited. For instance, [Plutarch] twice cites the Atthidographer\nPhilochorus (846B, 847A). However, diligent use of his Atthis would have resolved\nat least one of the problems which faced the biographer, as a passage of\nPhilochorus15 confirms that Andocides was indeed Kudaqh\u00b4naiov by deme affiliation\nand not Qoreu\u00b4v, which is the alternative that [Plutarch] gives at 834B. If the biogra-\npher had possessed a full text of Philochorus, he should theoretically have been able to\nresolve this and similar issues.\nThe problem with this line of thought lies in its assumption that if [Plutarch] had\naccess to an unexcerpted source, he may reasonably be supposed to have made the\nin the hands of the rhetors who were particularly interested in Andokides\u2019. If this were true,\n[Plutarch] would be using a source independent of Thucydides. Note, however, that this does\nnot explain why Thucydides fails to mention Metagenes or Dracontides, that the only evidence\nthat Jacoby cites for the existence of this \u2018Vita of Andokides\u2019 is the orator\u2019s entry in the Suda\n(which does not claim to come from a biography and cites only Hellanicus), and that the\n\u2018rhetors\u2019 who were so ready to interpolate a reference to an alleged piece of diplomatic\nspear-carrying by their hero\u2019s grandfather oddly failed to draw attention to the appearance of\nthe man himself at Thuc. 6.60.2, where the manuscripts preserve the anonymity of ei\u0003 v tw\u02dcn\ndedeme\u00b4nwn.\n12 Compare Dion. Hal. Lys. 1 (sunepaideu\u00b4qh toi\u02dcv e\u0001 pifanesta\u00b4toiv \u0001Aqhnai\u00b4wn) with [Plut.] 835C\n(sunepaideu\u00b4eto toi\u02dcv e\u0001 pifanesta\u00b4toiv \u0001Aqhnai\u00b4wn).\n13 E. Ofenloch (ed.), Caecilii Calactini Fragmenta (Leipzig, 1907), p. xxii: \u2018neque dubium\nest, quin aliis locis, ubi Caecilii nomen non adscriptum est, tamen is rhetor in usum vocatus sit\u2019.\nCf. also p. xxiii.\n14 For example, W. Treadgold, The Nature of the Bibliotheca of Photius (Washington DC,\n1980), 48. The elaborate hypothesis springs from the conviction that Photius was incapable of\noriginating the stylistic comments which are in the Bibliotheca, but not [Plutarch]. This evalu-\nation of Photius\u2019 capacities is unduly pessimistic; cf. N. G. Wilson, Scholars of Byzantium\n(London, 1983), 103\u20134, for a more balanced assessment. R. M. Smith, \u2018Photius on the Ten\nOrators\u2019, GRBS 33 (1992), 159\u201389, argues, surely rightly, that Photius used [Plutarch] as a\nbasis but was himself responsible for rearrangement and supplementation. For more on\ncodices 259\u201368 of the Bibliotheca and their usefulness in illuminating [Plutarch], see below.\n15 FGrH 328 F149.\nTHE LIVES OF THE TEN ORATORS 219\ncomprehensive use of it that a modern scholar would. Examination of the biogra-\npher\u2019s methodology, however, reveals that such an assumption is perhaps unduly san-\nguine, as [Plutarch] cannot in fact be relied upon to spot that different data at his\ncommand contradict each other. Thus he is capable of asserting in the Isocrates\nthat Demosthenes was unable to pay the rhetorician\u2019s fee (837D) and then, later in\nthe same life, that Isocrates poli\u00b4thn . . . ou\u0001 de\u00b4pote ei\u0001 se\u00b4praxe misqo\u00b4n (838F), though\nneither statement bears the hazard-lights of a w\u0002 v tine\u00b4v fasi vel sim.; it is noteworthy\nthat the version of this life in Photius\u2019 Bibliotheca (codex 260) keeps the story about\nDemosthenes but silently omits the claim that monies were never demanded from a\nfellow citizen.\n[Plutarch]\u2019s failure coherently to organize the divergent strands of biographical lore\nwith which he is confronted makes this particular mode of source-criticism rather\nunprofitable. Other modes of analysis, by contrast, work somewhat better. One par-\nticular fact which seems to have evaded comment in discussions of the Lives is\nthat their explicit citations from other authors are very unevenly distributed. For\nexample, three of the named sources enumerated in footnote 4 (namely Lysias,\nTheopompus the historian, and Cratinus) are found together in the space of a few\nlines in the Antiphon 833A\u2013B but are cited nowhere else in the Lives.16 By contrast,\nthe comparatively lengthy Lycurgus, which goes into great detail concerning the\neponymous orator\u2019s benefactions, personal habits, and political career, cites only\none source.17 The Isaeus too quotes only one source, but since that life is only\neighteen lines long, this is not so striking.\nFurther facts of interest attend upon this distribution. When one looks at the clus-\ntered citations in the Antiphon, for example, one is struck by their precision; views are\nattributed to Lusi\u00b4av e\u0001 n tw\u00bc\u02dc u\u0002 pe`r th\u02dcv \u0001Antifw\u02dcntov qugatro`v lo\u00b4gw\u00bc , Qeo\u00b4pompov e\u0001 n t}\u02dc\npentekaideka\u00b4t} tw\u02dcn Filippikw\u02dcn, and Krati\u02dcnov e\u0001 n Puti\u00b4n}. Elsewhere the citations\nare much less exact: of the six references to speeches by Demosthenes, for instance,\nonly one is allocated to a specific oration (namely, the Against Neaira at 836B).18\nThe immediate solution to this divergence of practice that springs to mind is, of\ncourse, that the passage in the Antiphon is excerpted from a source. As indicated\nabove, however, this solution, which in this case is almost certainly correct, raises\nas many problems as it solves. Why does [Plutarch] use this erudite and diligent\nsource for a short stretch of the Antiphon but not, if his practice in the rest of the\nLives is anything to go by, anywhere else?\nIllumination is best sought, perhaps, through consideration of the unique context in\nwhich these citational pyrotechnics take place. The biographer invokes these auth-\norities not for a straight piece of biographical narrative, or even to compare differing\nversions of the same event. When the authorities conflict on a simple question of fact,\nas in the case of the divergent versions of the death of Demosthenes at 847A\u2013B,\n[Plutarch] may line up the dissenting sources,19 but he does not allude to specific\nworks. Rather, the Antiphon passage tackles the more fundamental questions of the\nchronology of the orator\u2019s demise and the identities of the proliferation of\nAntiphons who still dog efforts to map the intellectual history of the fifth century B.C.\n16 Schaefer (n. 4), 31, notes the oddity that Theopompus is quoted for the Antiphon but not\nfor the Aeschines, Lycurgus, Demosthenes, or Hyperides, to which the Philippica would have\nbeen more obviously relevant.\n17 843A: peri` de` th\u02dcv khdei\u00b4av tau\u00b4thv le\u00b4gei o\u0002 Dei\u00b4narcov e\u0001 n tw\u00bc\u02dc kata` Pisti\u00b4ou.\n18 C. P. Jones, Plutarch and Rome (Oxford, 1971), 83, claims that such precision is \u2018a prac-\ntice that Plutarch seems to follow only when he has direct access to a work\u2019.\n19 In this case, Philochorus, Satyrus, and Eratosthenes.\nL . V. P ITCHER220\nNow, explicit discussion of chronological or prosopographical cruces is very rare in\nthe grand tradition of political, res gestae history that Jacoby dubbed Zeitgeschichte.\nThucydides and his successors may well have taken an interest in resolving such\nproblems to their own satisfaction, but it is unusual for them to \u2018show their\nworking\u2019.20 Nor does the focus on an individual enjoined by the genre of biography\nper se entail a commitment to the detailed working-out of such problems; Plutarch\u2019s\nattitude to chronological conundrums at Solon 27.1 might charitably be described as\nbreezy.21\nOne should not forget, however, that there were in antiquity certain more obscure\ngenres of historical writing, set apart a little from political historiography and biogra-\nphy a` la Plutarch, in which such discussions found a more prominent position. One\nthinks of the Atthidographers, whose annalistic format made a concern for correct\ndating fundamental to their enterprise. The Vita Aristotelis Marciana, for example,\npreserves Philochorus\u2019 sensible contribution to a heated debate over the chronology\nof that philosopher\u2019s career.22\nIn similar fashion, the identification of rogue bearers of the subject\u2019s name was a\nstaple characteristic of the sort of \u2018antiquarian\u2019 biography to which the genuine\nworks of Plutarch form so signal a contrast. Diogenes Laertius, for instance, regularly\ncatalogues homonyms at the conclusions to his lives of the philosophers.23 A later\nexample of this practice is to be found in the identification of Qoukudi\u00b4dai polloi\u00b4 in\nMarcellinus.24\nThe practitioners of these \u2018antiquarian\u2019 modes of historical writing characteristic-\nally demonstrate a far greater readiness to cite chapter and verse than their colleagues\nelsewhere in ancient historiography. Writers of res gestae history are disinclined for\nthe most part to specify the titles, let alone the book numbers, of other texts to which\nthey allude, though exceptions to this rule are by no means unexampled.25 Plutarch\nhimself, although perfectly prepared to specify the titles of treatises to which he\nalludes,26 appears only once to assign one of his quotations from Aeschines or\nDemosthenes to a particular speech.27\nHence, both [Plutarch]\u2019s uncharacteristic citational precision with regard to the\nspeeches of his orators, and the sort of discussion on which these citations are\nbrought to bear, suggest a source in the antiquarian tradition. It is thus possible to\nappreciate that the style, vocabulary, and arrangement of data in our author\u2019s handling\n20 There are, of course, exceptions: contrast Thuc. 6.54\u20135 and Polyb. 12.4a. Christopher\nPelling remarks that the argument about the genealogy of the Tarquinii at Dion. Hal. Ant.\nRom. 4.7 is in the same category. It will be noted that when such discussions do crop up in\nZeitgeschichte, it is usually in the context of assessments of the (in)competence of other\nhistorians.\n21 This passage should not, however, be taken as representing Plutarch\u2019s unvarying stance on\nthese matters; see C. B. R. Pelling, \u2018Truth and fiction in Plutarch\u2019s lives\u2019, in id., Plutarch and\nHistory: Eighteen Studies (London, 2002), 143\u201370, at 162, n. 3, and the passages there cited.\nSee also T.

He also alludes to particular episodes in the text of\nHomer, although he does not give book numbers (BCiv. 5.116.484), a not uncommon way of\nreferencing Homer in antiquity (cf. O. Taplin, Homeric Soundings [Oxford, 1992], 286).\n26 Plut. Sol. 11 gives some good examples. Note that whereas Plutarch is there precise about\nthe provenance of his allusions to Aristotle and Alcmaeon, he does not specify the speech of\nAeschines which he also mentions.\n27 Namely, the Against Meidias at Plut. Alc. 10.2.\nTHE LIVES OF THE TEN ORATORS 221\nof a particular theme can be every bit as useful in exploring his use of sources as an\nexplicit citation.\nThis insight can be generalized and applied to different passages. For example, no\nreader of the Lives can fail to be struck by the appearance of certain words which the\nauthor uses in senses uncommon in standard Greek usage. Note in particular the uses\nof the verbs a\u0001 kma\u00b4zw and paratei\u00b4nw in describing the lives of the orators. Both verbs\nare perfectly unexceptionable, but [Plutarch]\u2019s deployment of the former in particular\nis striking; in the works of the real Plutarch, the word retains its connotations of flour-\nishing vigour, whereas our author sometimes uses it to mean simply \u2018was alive and\nneither very young nor very old\u2019.28\nA more unusual characteristic of [Plutarch]\u2019s use of these verbs is a seemingly idio-\nsyncratic fondness for the perfect tense where the context does not seem to demand it;\nh\u0004 kmake me`n kata` tou\u02dcton to`n cro\u00b4non a\u0005 ma Swkra\u00b4tei (835A), parate\u00b4taken e\u0005 wv\nkatalu\u00b4sewv th\u02dcv dhmokrati\u00b4av (832F). That this usage disturbed Photius, a man who\nprided himself upon his feeling for Attic idiom, is shown by the normalization\nof these tenses in the parallel passages of the Bibliotheca; the former becomes\nsunakma\u00b4sai [rather than sunhkmake\u00b4nai] de` Swkra\u00b4tei tw\u00bc\u02dc filoso\u00b4fw\u00bc le\u00b4getai29 and the\nlatter pare\u00b4teine [rather than parate\u00b4take] de` to`n bi\u00b4on e\u0005 wv th\u02dcv . . . katalu\u00b4sewv th\u02dcv\ndhmokrati\u00b4av.30\nWhat explanation is there for these somewhat unusual usages? The problem is\nresolved when one realizes that for [Plutarch] the principal use of these verbs is in\nfixing chronologies. In this sense a\u0001 kma\u00b4zw is common in Diogenes Laertius.\nDiogenes drew upon the chronological tables of Apollodorus, and it is instructive\nto note that the only parallel for [Plutarch]\u2019s use of paratei\u00b4nw in the perfect tense\nto emerge from a TLG search of all the classical and Byzantine Greek historians is\nin a quotation from that chronographer in the works of Clement of Alexandria.31\nIt is therefore tempting to speculate that the grammatical oddity which troubled the\nsensibilities of Photius is a characteristic usage of chronographical scholarship, which\n[Plutarch], lacking the inclination or capacity to recast his sources into an entirely\nhomogeneous whole, faithfully preserves. Now it becomes clear why our author\u2019s\nlack of stylistic pretensions makes the Lives so valuable as a document in the study\nof ancient biography. The \u2018pick and mix\u2019 texture of the work is the result not\nmerely of recording different versions of events, but of the author\u2019s utilization of\ndifferent modes of writing about the past in his sources, which, differing in style,\ndiction, and arrangement of material as well as in subject-matter, are responsible\nfor the curiously rag-bag quality in the finished product.\nThis is a large claim, and one best illustrated by means of an example. [Plutarch],\nwhile unobservant, as we have already noted, with regard to contradictions in his\nsubject matter, is as resistant as most classical authors to the idea of repeating\nhimself.32 When he is compelled for the purposes of explanation to repeat something\nthat he has already covered, he usually remembers to insert a w\u0002 v proei\u00b4rhtai.33 In one\ninstance, however, this resistance is notable by its absence. [Plutarch] twice informs\n28 This age qualification is patent at 845E, where it is remarked that Xenophon knew\nDemosthenes h\u0006 a\u0001 rco\u00b4menon h\u0006 a\u0001 kma\u00b4zonta.\n29 Phot.

V. P ITCHER222\nthe reader that Lysias was born in the archonship of Philocles, but the repetition of this\ndatum contains no reference back to the first.34 There is, to be sure, a good reason for\nthe repetition of Lysias\u2019 alleged year of birth at this point. [Plutarch] has just set out\nconflicting reports on the orator\u2019s age at his death, and it is therefore logical to insert a\nreference to his year of birth. The inconcinnity between the two passages remains,\nhowever,35 and calls for explanation.\nI would tentatively argue that this lapse is the result of a clash between different\nways of structuring a biography. When [Plutarch] introduces birth-years at all, their\nposition in the life is not fixed; they are not regularly found at any particular point\nin the narrative. In the sort of antiquarian biography of which Diogenes is the most\nvoluminous extant representative, however, information about the subject\u2019s \u2018dates\u2019\ndoes indeed have a regular spot; it is usually in a position immediately after the nar-\nrative of the subject\u2019s notable deeds\/sayings and before a discussion of their works. It\nwill be noted that this is exactly the point at which the anomalous second notice of the\norator\u2019s birth is found in [Plutarch]\u2019s Lysias, just after the story of the orator\u2019s life and\nbefore the catalogue of his speeches. A plausible hypothesis for the repetition there-\nfore suggests itself, that the \u2018antiquarian biography\u2019 approach being used at this point\nin the life tends to put the birth-date in a different location from the genre used earlier\non, so leading the impercipient author to repeat himself when he switches between the\ntwo.\n[Plutarch]\u2019s failure to draw attention to his repetition is therefore somewhat akin to a\nloose thread, a spot where the incommensurability of different ways of writing biogra-\nphy is laid bare. Like all loose threads, it asks to be pulled. Closer study of the texture\nof the narrative of the Lysias before the second reference to the orator\u2019s birth reveals\nsomething that, as the examples above indicated, tends to be significant in this author,\na stylistic quirk or focus of interest which the rest of the Lives does not manifest. In the\ncase of the Antiphon, this was an unparalleled cluster of rigorous citations. In the\nLysias, by contrast, the anomalous phenomenon is a predilection for archon-years.\nArchon-years are by no means a rarity in the Lives. Outside the Lysias, eighteen are\ngiven in the body of the text,36 and a further three in the appended documents.37 Nor is\nthe mere quantity of archon-years in the Lysias38 unique; there are seven in the\nDemosthenes, although one should note that the former life is approximately 35\nper cent of the latter\u2019s length. The striking characteristic of the use of archon-years\nin the Lysias is rather that they are deployed in tight chronological sequence to\nprovide a clear temporal framework for the principal events of Lysias\u2019 life, namely\nhis birth, his removal to Sybaris, the accusation that he harboured Attic sympathies,\nand his arrival in Athens. This contrasts strongly with the more haphazard application\nof archon-years elsewhere in the work,39 and should therefore provoke speculation as\nto what it signifies.40\n34 835C: geno\u00b4menov d\u0001 \u0001Aqh\u00b4nhsin e\u0001 pi` Filokle\u00b4ouv a\u0004 rcontov; 836A: gennhqh\u02dcnai de\u00b4 fasin e\u0001 pi`\nFilokle\u00b4ouv a\u0004 rcontov.\n35 Note too that what is presented as a plain fact at 835C becomes a more cautious gennhqh\u02dcnai\nde\u00b4 fasin at 836A.\n36 At 833D, 835A, 836F, 837E, 839D (bis), 842F, 843C, 844A, 844C, 845D (bis), 845E (bis),\n847D (bis), 850B, 850D.\n37 At 851D, 851E, and 851F.\n38 There are archon-years in the Lysias at 835C, 835D (ter), 835E, and 836A; there is also a\nreference to a\u0001 narci\u00b4av th\u02dcv pro` Eu\u0001 klei\u00b4dou at 835F.\n39 Contrast, for example, the rather chaotic application of archon-years at 845E.\n40 Ofenloch (n. 13), p. xxv, noting that the whole of this life \u2018optima coniunctione verborum\net sententiarum continua est\u2019, was inclined to attribute it all to a lost Life of Lysias by Caecilius.\nTHE LIVES OF THE TEN ORATORS 223\nAn answer is not far to seek, as a passage in Diogenes Laertius\u2019 life of Aristotle\nadopts a mode of narration strikingly similar to that which is found in the Lysias.41\nOnce again the key stages in the protagonist\u2019s life and, above all, his movements\nfrom one place to another are neatly structured around archon-years; Aristotle\u2019s\nmigrations to Mytilene, Hermias, and Philip all receive such a date. Diogenes,\nhowever, is obliging enough to preface this account with the words fhsi` d\u0001\n\u0001Apollo\u00b4dwrov e\u0001 n Cronikoi\u02dcv.42 The similarity in the focus of narration and the packa-\nging of the data, therefore, makes it very likely that [Plutarch]\u2019s aberrant conglomera-\ntion of archon-years derives from the characteristic concerns and style of Apollodoran\nchronography. \u2018As always, material determines treatment.\u201943\nNote too, at the end of this little flare of chronological concern, a flicker of interest\nin the sort of feat of synchronization that appealed to the chronographers and those\nwhom they influenced:44 the reader is assured that the aged Lysias saw the youthful\nDemosthenes. It is, of course, wildly improbable that the contemporary sources for\nLysias\u2019 old age saw fit to chronicle all his meetings with the youth of Athens on\nthe off chance that one of the latter might later attain eminence. The comment\nstems rather from the \u2018since x died then, and y was born then, x would have been\nable to meet y\u2019 reasoning characteristic of a chronologer with an interest in cultural\nhistory. Finally, the conjecture that this extended chronographical lore is limited to\nthe person of Lysias45 is confirmed by the fact that on the two occasions in other\nlives when [Plutarch] gives precise relative ages (namely \u2018x was y years younger\/\nolder than z\u2019), Lysias always seems to have been included as the other term,\nthough it should be stressed that the considerable textual problems in both of these\npassages make this evidence rather insecure.46\nThis survey of [Plutarch]\u2019s relationship to the sources on which he depends has\nbeen of necessity very selective, focusing only on a number of paradigmatic passages.\nExamination of every citation of a preceding author and every passage where a par-\nticular predecessor may be inferred would have swollen this study to unmanageable\nproportions. This enforced brevity has not, however, prevented certain themes from\nemerging.\n41 Diog. Laert. 5.9\u201310.\n42 \u00bcFGrH 244 F38A.\n43 R.

The exercise continues to appeal; cf. the chronological chain back to Charles II at C. M.\nBowra, Memories: 1898\u20131939 (Cambridge, 1966), 138, and the role played by a very young\nJohn Webster in the film Shakespeare In Love.\n45 \u2018Extended\u2019 should be emphasized here; we have already seen traces of chronographical\nvocabulary elsewhere in the Lives.\n46 835A [of Andocides]: w\u0005 st\u0001 ei\u0007 nai presbu\u00b4teron au\u0001 to`n Lusi\u00b4ou e\u0004 tesi\u00b4 pou \u2020e\u0002 kato\u00b4n; 836F [of\nIsocrates]: knew\u00b4terov me`n Lusi\u00b4oul dusi` kai` ei\u0004 kosin e\u0004 tesi, presbu\u00b4terov de` Pla\u00b4twnov e\u0002 pta\u00b4. In\n835A the manuscripts read e\u0002 kato\u00b4n, which even [Plutarch] would have recognized as false;\nthe name or the number must be corrupt, and critics have rightly preferred to emend the\nlatter (de\u00b4ka Westermann; o\u0001 ktw\u00b4 Taylor). The problem at 836F is more serious. The text in the\nmanuscripts appears lacunose and the word Lusi\u00b4ou is only a supplement (proposed by\nBernardakis, following Wolf). It is, however, a likely one. presbu\u00b4terov de` in the manuscripts\nhints at the loss of a preceding new\u00b4terov me\u00b4n; Lusi\u00b4ou would provide a neat explanation for\nthe omission, which would have been caused by the homoearcton with Lusima\u00b4cou\nMurrinousi\u00b4ou in the preceding line, and it is consistent with the entire ancient tradition to\nclaim that Isocrates was twenty-two years younger than Lysias. Whether Lysias was actually\nborn in 459\/8 is a moot point, but one not germane to the present discussion; see C. Carey,\nLysias: Selected Speeches (Cambridge,1989), p. ix, for the arguments.\nL . V. P ITCHER224\nAbove all, the folly of lumping our author\u2019s sources together under the commo-\ndious designation of \u2018the biographical tradition\u2019 has become plain. The texture of\nthe Lives is disconcerting not because it reflects simple disagreements on matters\nof fact between its sources; such problems are after all present in the genuine\nworks of Plutarch, if not in such opulent profusion. Rather, [Plutarch]\u2019s failure to\nforge a homogeneous stylistic whole presents the reader with a promiscuous welter\nof different ways of writing about the past, from the epigraphy underlying the\nLycurgus to the chronographical mode underlying part of the Lysias. It is this that pro-\nduces the chaotic effect, and makes the Lives of the Ten Orators perhaps the single\nmost compelling demonstration of the wisdom of Momigliano\u2019s insistence on the\nProtean character of early Greek biography.47\nHowever, the methodology which this study has deployed so far risks giving a\nsomewhat partial picture of the Lives. Stress has been laid on the author\u2019s unwilling-\nness or inability to impose stylistic uniformity, and the ways in which this enables the\ncareful reader to lay bare the nature of his sources. Yet [Plutarch] is not altogether a\nthing of shreds and patches; it is perhaps possible to see places where his own agenda\nand consistent interests are evident in his management of his material. The next\nsection of this study will therefore focus on some of these passages.\nIII. THE LIVES OF THE TEN ORATORS ON THE HISTORY AND PRACTICE\nOF RHETORIC\nThe heterogeneous character of the Lives may seem to make reference to their \u2018inter-\nests\u2019, as if they were consistent, hard to justify. Nevertheless, two test cases indicate\ninstances where the author\u2019s own views on the nature of the past and the generic press-\nures imposed by the sort of format that he has adopted make such a conclusion more\ncompelling.\nAs in the previous section, it proves useful to work up to wider conclusions through\nstudy of a problematic passage. In this case, an interesting point of departure is\nafforded by the comments which our author appends to the claim that Antiphon\nwas the first to write forensic speeches for those in need of them, w\u0005 sper tine\u00b4v fasi.\n[Plutarch] then (832D) tries to back up this assertion48 with the observation that\nthere are no forensic speeches extant from the pens of either those who lived\nbefore Antiphon or tw\u02dcn kat\u0001 au\u0001 to\u00b4n . . . ou\u0001 Qemistokle\u00b4ouv ou\u0001 k \u0001Aristei\u00b4dou ou\u0001\nPerikle\u00b4ouv, because there was not yet any custom of speech-writing, dia` to`\nmhde\u00b4pw e\u0001 n e\u0004 qei tou\u02dc suggra\u00b4fein ei\u0007 nai.\nThe statement itself is unremarkable. The terms of reference that it implies,\nhowever, give pause for thought. The problem is that the threesome of\nThemistocles, Aristides, and Pericles is at once too ample and too restricted in its\ncompass to have a pellucid effect. On the one hand it is disconcerting to find the\nobvious duo of Themistocles and Aristides supplemented by the much younger\nPericles, while on the other, one wonders why the list stops where it does. Pericles\nwas not the only skilled persuader at large in Athens in the second half of the fifth\ncentury B.C. What about Cleon, tw\u00bc\u02dc . . . dh\u00b4mw\u00bc para` polu` e\u0001 n tw\u00bc\u02dc to\u00b4te piqanw\u00b4tatov,49\n47 A. D.

[Plutarch] is\nnot, after all, suggesting that this is an exhaustive list of eloquent speakers active in the\nAthens of the fifth century. He just needs a few examples of predecessors and\/or con-\ntemporaries of Antiphon whom one might have expected, given their oratorical\nprowess, to have contested his forensic primacy.\nOne might, therefore, be tempted to put down this passage to authorial whim. Such\na response is perhaps, however, a little precipitate. I would tentatively suggest that\nwhat the reader encounters here is a case of the usually diffident author attempting\nto impose a structure on the recalcitrant material at his disposal. To be more\nprecise, [Plutarch]\u2019s sense of the appropriate way in which to begin the sort of enter-\nprise that he is undertaking is clashing with the stubbornly static Canon of the Ten that\nhe has inherited.\nThe date at which the Canon of the Ten Orators came into being has been keenly\ndisputed, as have the reasons for its creation. For the purposes of this discussion,\nhowever, it is necessary to note only two salient points. Firstly, the Canon was in\nall probability in place before the time of our author (whenever that may have\nbeen) since it appears that Quintilian was aware of it.51 Secondly, it is most unlikely\nthat it was intended to map the development of Attic oratory from a diachronic per-\nspective. Whether those who were allotted places in the pantheon won them through\nthe perceived purity of their Attic diction or a more general criterion of \u2018greatness\u2019\nremains a matter for conjecture, but it seems highly improbable that the idea was\nto give a sense of the historical development of the genre, any more than The\nNation\u2019s Favourite Love Poems seeks to plot the metamorphosis of erotic verse\nfrom amour courtois to \u2018Celia, Celia\u2019.\nNow consider the two other famous collections of potted Greek biographies which\nare still extant: Diogenes Laertius\u2019 Lives of the Philosophers and the Lives of the\nSophists written by Flavius Philostratus. It will be noted that each of these enterprises\nopens with an account of the discipline of which its subjects were practitioners. Thus\nthe opening sentence of Diogenes asserts that to` th\u02dcv filosofi\u00b4av e\u0004 rgon e\u0004 nioi\u00b4 fasin a\u0001 po`\nbarba\u00b4rwn a\u0004 rxai,52 and the biographer then goes on to identify Greek originators of the\ndiscipline in the persons of Musaeus and Linus.53 Philostratus in similar vein sketches\nout an early relationship between sofistikh` r\u0002 htorikh\u00b4 and philosophy,54 and then\nidentifies Gorgias and Aeschines as the originators of the two types of rhetoric.55\nThese passages illuminate [Plutarch]\u2019s problem. The generic propriety of the\n\u2018potted biography\u2019 format, antiquity\u2019s closest approach to what we would call cultural\nhistory, impels him to delineate at the outset of his enterprise the origins of the dis-\ncipline practised by his subjects and to isolate its originator(s). He is immediately\nfaced, however, with the difficulty that Antiphon, the first of the canonical Attic\norators, cannot be regarded as the prw\u02dctov eu\u0002 reth\u00b4v of oratory, which was clearly in\n50 FGrH 115 FF85\u2013100. This capacious catalogue seems to have stretched from\nThemistocles to Eubulus.\n51 For analysis of the relevant passages, see I. Worthington, \u2018The Canon of the Ten Attic\nOrators\u2019, in I. Worthington (ed.), Persuasion: Greek Rhetoric in Action (London and\nNew York, 1994), 244\u201363, at 249\u201359.\n52 Diog. Laert. 1.1.\n53 Diog. Laert. 1.3.\n54 Philostr. VS 480.\n55 Philostr. VS 481.\nL . V. P ITCHER226\nplace long before. He therefore has to resort to something that Antiphon was the first\nto do in order to give him some reason for starting his coverage of oratory where he\ndoes; hence the emphasis on the orator\u2019s unprecedented composition of forensic\nspeeches for the assistance of needy litigants.\nThis explains why [Plutarch]\u2019s coverage of this particular innovation is so explicit\nand exhaustive, when his treatment of later departures from previous practice, such as\nIsaeus\u2019 introduction of sch\u00b4mata,56 is much more cursory in its coverage. The draw-\nback of this piece of ingenuity is that the reader is thereby given a misleading\nimpression of the focus of the coming biographies. Diogenes uses a discussion of\nthe origins of philosophy to introduce lives of philosophers and Philostratus a discus-\nsion of the genesis of sophistic rhetoric to introduce lives of sophists. By this logic,\none would expect [Plutarch]\u2019s initial emphasis on the development of forensic\noratory to lead to the biographies of forensic orators. The Lives, however, shows no\nsuch inclination to privilege dikanikoi` lo\u00b4goi, or any type of rhetoric, over any of\nthe other types.57 The tension between the inherited canon\u2019s synchronic gallery of\nmerit and the \u2018potted biography\u2019 genre\u2019s emphasis on diachronic development has\nforced our author into a not entirely successful effort to square the circle, hence the\nsomewhat incongruous nature of this passage.\nIt is instructive to contrast Cicero\u2019s reflections on Attic oratory at Brutus 26\u20137.\nUntrammelled by [Plutarch]\u2019s cramping canon, the Roman orator is free to people\nhis stage with rather more players and allude to the inferred rhetorical prowess of\nPisistratus, Solon, and Cleisthenes,58 all of whom our author lumps anonymously\ntogether as tw\u02dcn . . . pro au\u0001 tou\u02dc genome\u00b4nwn, as well as commenting on the skills of\nCleon, Alcibiades, Critias, and Theramenes.59 For [Plutarch], this strategy would\nbe more problematic, as extensive coverage of orators outside the canon points up\nthe rather arbitrary nature of its selection criteria when viewed from the diachronic\nperspective enjoined by cultural history.\nThe curious passage at the start of the Antiphon gives a demonstration that the\n\u2018potted biography\u2019 format of the Lives is not just a capacious bag into which assorted\ndata can be flung willy-nilly; the form exerts its own influence on the way in which\ndata and arguments are presented. It is also possible, perhaps, to detect our author in\noccasional efforts to impose his own order on the data that he has inherited. This is\nmost evident in his treatment of the nature of rhetoric itself.\nIt is a central paradox of the Lives of the Ten Orators that the author of a work\nconcerned with some of the most stylish and elegant writers of Attic prose does\nnot in fact seem to be very interested in matters of style. [Plutarch] does deliver\nshort summaries of the stylistic features of some of the ten,60 reports Isocrates\u2019\nalleged derivation of his Panegyricus from Gorgias and Lysias (837F), and shows\nan interest in matters of actio such as the linguistic mannerisms of Demosthenes\n(845B) and the vocal qualities of Isocrates (837A) and Aeschines (840E).\nHowever, some of the orators (notably Lycurgus) escape stylistic evaluation\n56 839F: prw\u02dctov de` kai` schmati\u00b4zein h\u0004 rxato kai` tre\u00b4pein e\u0001 pi` to` politiko`n th`n dia\u00b4noian.\n57 Thus [Plutarch] is equally accommodating to, for example, Lysias\u2019 speech at Olympia\n(836D), Isocrates\u2019 epideictic extravaganzas (837F), and Hyperides\u2019 skill at symbouleutic rheto-\nric (849D).\n58 Cic.

It is once more helpful to consider the reaction of\nPhotius, whose interest in matters of style was keenly developed.64 The future patri-\narch, clearly feeling [Plutarch]\u2019s coverage of this topic to be jejune, supplemented the\nstylistic analyses extensively.65\n[Plutarch]\u2019s disinclination to spend much time on analysis of the stylistic qualities\nof his subjects is reflected, perhaps, in his general lack of interest in the notion of style\nas an expression of character, an idea well established in ancient literature,66 and one\nthat might well be expected to have appealed to a biographer.67 More significant for\nthe present purposes, however, is his resistance to the attempts enshrined in one of his\nmost important sources to deconstruct the opposition, in modern parlance, between\nphilosophy and rhetoric. The most explicit example of this idea is the preface to\nthe discussions of the ancient orators written by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, where\nthe critic hails the return of h\u0002 . . . a\u0001 rcai\u00b4a kai` filo\u00b4sofov r\u0002 htorikh\u00b4, as opposed to the\ninferior variant which arose a\u0001 po` th\u02dcv \u0001Alexa\u00b4ndrou tou\u02dc Makedo\u00b4nov teleuth\u02dcv.68 The\nmeans by which rhetoric can be made \u2018philosophical\u2019 are made clear in Dionysius\u2019\nIsocrates.69\n[Plutarch]\u2019s views on the relationship between philosophy and rhetoric, however,\nseem to have been rather more old-fashioned, in that he appears to embrace the stan-\ndard division between the contemplative ivory-tower nature of philosophy and the\npolitical engagement characteristic of rhetoric. He is perfectly prepared, it is true,\nto note that some considered Aeschines, Demosthenes, Lycurgus, and Hyperides to\nhave been imitators or students of Plato.70 For all except Aeschines, however, he is\nquick to introduce the alternative mentor Isocrates, and the phraseology of the\nLycurgus passage in particular shows that he views philosophy and rhetoric not as\nfundamentally indissoluble but rather as distinct and discrete paths of life.71\n61 835B: e\u0004 sti d\u0001 a\u0002 plou\u02dcv kai` a\u0001 kata\u00b4skeuov e\u0001 n toi\u02dcv lo\u00b4goiv, a\u0001 felh\u00b4v te kai` a\u0001 schma\u00b4tistov.

V. P ITCHER228\nIt might be argued that this view of the opposition between rhetoric and philosophy\nis simply imported from older sources which did not share the deconstructing zeal of\nDionysius. Against this argument, however, one notes that [Plutarch] can be detected\nin the act of strategically recasting Dionysian material in order to make it accord with\nthe more traditional dichotomy between rhetoric and philosophy to which he himself\nadheres. It is instructive to look at a significant way in which his account of the life of\nIsocrates differs from that offered by Dionysius.\nBoth writers note that at one stage in his life Isocrates turned to the writing of\nmorally improving works and tried to set out the nature of his thought, in phraseology\nso nearly identical that [Plutarch] is clearly drawing upon Dionysius.72 Dionysius,\nhowever, implies that this was the way in which Isocrates spent the rest of his life,\nand thus that all of his subsequent work is to be seen as a continuation of this practice.\n[Plutarch], by contrast, both points up the \u2018philosophical\u2019 character of this retreat73\nand asserts that Isocrates failed in his purpose in this pursuit and so changed to a\ndifferent tack: diamarta\u00b4nwn de` th\u02dcv proaire\u00b4sewv, tou\u00b4twn me`n a\u0001 pe\u00b4sth, scolh\u02dcv d\u0001\nh\u0002 gei\u02dcto. In Dionysius, who is eager to officiate at the wedding of philosophy and\noratory, Isocrates\u2019 \u2018philosophical\u2019 phase is the consummation of his achievement;\nfor [Plutarch], who is not, it is an unsuccessful aberration.\nOne might also remark in passing on another case where it is possible that\n[Plutarch] is strategically recasting his sources in order to suit his own view of the\nrelationship between philosophy and rhetoric. This concerns an odd omission in his\nlist of the pupils of Isocrates (837C\u2013D). This includes both such celebrated alumni\nas Theopompus and Ephorus and more obscure figures such as Asclepiades and\nTheodektas, yet it conspicuously fails to mention Xenophon. It is noteworthy that\nthis omission is duly rectified at the appropriate point in Photius\u2019 Bibliotheca.74 In\nthe light of the observations above, it is perhaps possible to speculate why\n[Plutarch] left him out. While our author is perfectly aware of Xenophon\u2019s work as\na historian,75 the description of him as o\u0002 Swkratiko\u00b4v at 845E shows that [Plutarch]\nshares the general tendency of antiquity to think of him primarily as a philosopher.76\nTo introduce a person of this philosophical bent as a student of the rhetorician\nIsocrates would have blurred our author\u2019s established dichotomy between the two dis-\nciplines. There again, one should not, perhaps, read too much into this omission. It has\nalready been noted that [Plutarch] has no objection to the reverse process of describ-\ning orators as students of Plato, and several alleged pupils of Isocrates with no philo-\nsophical leanings whatever are passed over just as silently as Xenophon.77\n72 Dion.

Bibl. codex 260. R. Henry, Photius: Bibliothe`que Tome 8 (Paris, 1977), 44, n. 5,\ndoubts that this insertion is the work of Photius himself, but even if it is \u2018une glose qui a e\u00b4te\u00b4\nintroduite dans la tradition\u2019, it remains significant that someone was troubled by [Plutarch]\u2019s\nomission.\n75 Note the reference to the Hellenica at 845E.\n76 Diogenes Laertius, for example, gives him a biography as such (Diog. Laert. 2.48\u201359); it\nis suggestive that Diogenes does not mention the tradition of study with Isocrates either. For the\nattitude of Plutarch himself to Xenophon, L. Van der Stockt, \u2018\u201cPolybiasasthai\u201d? Plutarch on\nTimaeus and Phylarchus (and the like)\u2019 in the Acta of \u2018The Shadow of Polybius:\nIntertextuality as a Research Tool in Greek Historiography\u2019, a 2001 Leuven conference ( forth-\ncoming), is illuminating.\n77 For example, the Atthidographer Androtion; cf. the passages collected at FGrH 324\nTT1\u20132.\nTHE LIVES OF THE TEN ORATORS 229\nTo sum up, therefore, this section\u2019s analysis of [Plutarch]\u2019s coverage of the history\nand nature of rhetoric suggests that our author is not, after all, entirely incapable of\nputting his own \u2018spin\u2019 on the material that he has inherited, and that he is demonstra-\nbly setting himself within the tradition of \u2018potted biography\u2019 of which Diogenes\nLaertius and Flavius Philostratus are the most voluminous extant representatives.\nWhile the preceding section stressed the extent to which the characteristic styles\nand preoccupations of [Plutarch]\u2019s sources may be detected in the completed work,\nthis one has suggested that our author is not always merely a transparent vessel\nwherein his untransmuted source-material may be seen.\nIV. SOME VERSIONS OF DEMOSTHENES\nEven without recourse to the divergent versions whose survival makes it the logical\nchoice for use as an extended test case, [Plutarch]\u2019s Demosthenes clearly manifests to\nthe attentive reader certain of the features that have been noted above as characteristic\nof our biographer. It contains, for instance, a fine example of [Plutarch]\u2019s far from\ninfallible eye for inconsistencies in his source-material;78 the basis of Epicles\u2019 gibe\nat 848C79 is contradicted by the statement of Demosthenes\u2019 gift for extempore speak-\ning only a few lines later,80 yet our author shows no sign of being troubled by this.\nLikewise characteristic is the failure to make use of the Demosthenic material\ncovered in the other lives or to direct the reader to the material in question; one\nscours the Demosthenes in vain for anecdotes about the orator\u2019s dealings with\nIsocrates (cf. 837D\u2013E), his failure at the court of Philip (841A), the allegation that\nIsaeus wrote the speeches against his guardians (839F), or the claim that Hyperides\nsurpassed him as an orator (849D).81\nThe Demosthenes likewise betrays the fluctuations in the deployment of sources\nthat have already been detected elsewhere in the Lives. Although Aeschines is cited\nexplicitly only once in the course of the Lives (840F), one can detect certain state-\nments that seem to find their original sources in the orator\u2019s speeches. A case in\npoint is the claim vaguely attributed to \u2018certain people\u2019 that Demosthenes was a trans-\nvestite; [Plutarch]\u2019s neutral fasi` de\u00b4 tinev kai` a\u0001 sw\u00b4twv au\u0001 to`n biw\u02dcnai, gunaikei\u00b4aiv . . .\ne\u0001 sqh\u02dcsi crw\u00b4menon (847E) masks the tradition\u2019s probable origin in the sneers of\nAeschines in his speech against Timarchus.82 One suspects that this assertion came\nto [Plutarch] pre-packaged in an intermediate source; Hermippus, to whom the\nSuda attributes the claim that Demosthenes was pro`v ta`v h\u0002 dona`v a\u0001 ko\u00b4lastov,83 is a\nlikely candidate.84\nThe passage on Demosthenes\u2019 personal life therefore exemplifies what we have\nalready noted in Section II above, in its demonstration of the ways in which the bio-\ngrapher\u2019s sources can be discerned through the texture of his work. At the same time,\nhowever, it brings out the theme of Section III, the ways in which we can nevertheless\n78 Noticed as such by Fowler (n. 5), 436, n.

P ITCHER230\ndiscern the author\u2019s consistent interests, in that [Plutarch] demonstrates throughout\nthe Lives a regular fascination with such prurient details, being particularly interested\nin sexual idiosyncrasy or incontinence.85 The Demosthenes is therefore of clear use in\nbringing out the themes adumbrated above, even without recourse to alternative treat-\nments of the life of the eponymous orator.\nHowever, it remains true that the most fruitful mode of analysis where the\nDemosthenes is concerned lies in comparison with the other accounts of its subject\u2019s\ncareer, and above all that from the pen of the genuine Plutarch.86 At its simplest level,\nthis consists simply of noting the latter\u2019s response to lines of thought which [Plutarch]\nleaves untouched. Plutarch, for example, despite his professed unwillingness to\nbecome bogged down in stylistic analysis,87 makes great capital out of the way in\nwhich the pikri\u00b4a of Demosthenes\u2019 temperament is mirrored by a like pikri\u00b4a in his\nrhetoric.88 This is explicit in the passage concerning the nickname \u2018Argas\u2019, where\nbalanced parallel clauses drive home the congruity between character and style (o\u0002 d\u0001\n\u0001Arga\u02dcv . . . h\u0006 pro`v to`n tro\u00b4pon, w\u0002 v qhriw\u00b4dh kai` pikro`n e\u0001 te\u00b4qh . . . h\u0006 pro`v to`n lo\u00b4gon, w\u0002 v\na\u0001 niw\u02dcnta tou`v a\u0001 krowme\u00b4nouv)89 and is kept before the reader\u2019s attention through the\nseveral later characterizations of Demosthenic utterances as pikro\u00b4v vel sim.90\nAgain, observation of the citational habits of [Plutarch] and his inclination to focus\non certain subjects can likewise be illuminated by simple comparison with Plutarch\u2019s\ndifferent methodology. Use of material from the speeches of Aeschines constitutes a\ngood example, in that Plutarch, unlike our biographer, shows a judicious reluctance\nto repose much faith in the unsupported testimony of his subject\u2019s sworn enemy.\nWhen he does quote Aeschines\u2019 aspersions on Cleobule\u2019s parentage, he inserts an\nauthorial disclaimer,91 and, unlike our author, he never alludes to the famous story\nof Demosthenes\u2019 drying-up in the presence of Philip, for which Aeschines is, of\ncourse, the witness.92 What makes this silence particularly interesting is that this\nanecdote of a great orator whose powers failed him through timidity just when\nthey would have been most useful offered Plutarch a tempting parallel for Cicero\u2019s\nsimilar failure in the trial of Milo, which he does cover in the parallel Life of\nCicero.93 Likewise, enthusiastic endorsement of Aeschines\u2019 mud-slinging about\nCleobule would have facilitated the comparison which Plutarch explicitly draws\nbetween the relatively humble origins of the two orators, e\u0001 k me`n a\u0001 do\u00b4xwn kai`\nmikrw\u02dcn i\u0001 scurou`v kai` mega\u00b4louv genome\u00b4nouv.94 This restraint is not always paralleled\n85 Cf. e.g. the scented pillow of Isocrates (839A) and Hyperides\u2019 collection of kept women\n(849D).\n86 Westermann\u2019s view that [Plutarch]\u2019s Demosthenes represents the second attempt of\nPlutarch himself is comprehensively refuted by Schaefer (n. 4), 32\u20135.\n87 Plut.

Dem. 3.4.\nTHE LIVES OF THE TEN ORATORS 231\nin the later tradition,95 and is noteworthy in Plutarch, who has been accused, not\nentirely without justice, of sometimes sharpening his comparisons at the expense\nof historical accuracy.96\nThe list of these examples could easily be extended. It is important to remember,\nhowever, that these divergences are not the result of spur-of-the-moment decisions\nby the several authors; rather the slant in each case is aimed at crafting a larger\nvision of the life of Demosthenes. The extent to which the different authors are\ncapable of doing this varies. It has already been seen that [Plutarch]\u2019s ability to do\nthis, while not negligible, is distinctly limited, whereas the genuine Plutarch\u2019s\nmastery of his material is considerably more complete. Nevertheless, su\u00b4gkrisiv of\nselected passages must not exclude the larger contexts in which these passages are\nembedded.\nA simple demonstration of this principle is given by the different ways in which our\nauthor, Plutarch, and Zosimus of Ascalon handle the suit brought by Demosthenes\nagainst his guardians. In [Plutarch], he succeeds in the suit but exacts none of the\npenalty, tou`v me`n ka\u0001 fei`vl a\u0001 rguri\u00b4ou, tou`v de` kai` ca\u00b4ritov97 (844D). In Plutarch, by con-\ntrast, he is unable to retrieve more than a portion of his birthright: kateutuch\u00b4sav\ne\u0001 kpra\u02dcxai me`n ou\u0001 de` pollosto`n h\u0001 dunh\u00b4qh me\u00b4rov tw\u02dcn patrw\u00bc\u00b4wn.98 Finally, according to\nZosimus he was careful to reclaim only what was due to him, not as much as he\ncould have exacted: to` me`n ga`r h\u0007 n th\u02dcv deino\u00b4thtov th\u02dcv r\u0002 htorikh\u02dcv, to` de` th\u02dcv\nDhmosqe\u00b4nouv filanqrwpi\u00b4av.99\nInvestigation of the larger concepts of Demosthenes being propagated by the differ-\nent authors lays bare the reasons behind this divergence. One of [Plutarch]\u2019s persistent\ninterests throughout the Lives is the documentation of precise amounts of money,100\nan interest not really shared by the two other authors under discussion. His specifica-\ntion of the penalty at ten talents is therefore unsurprising. One then notes the differ-\nence in nuance between his account of the orator\u2019s motives and that of Zosimus; he\ngives the motives as a\u0001 rguri\u00b4ou and ca\u00b4ritov.101 The latter word, of course, tends to carry\na reciprocal do ut des flavour, and so connotes a more pragmatic benevolence far\nremoved from Zosimus\u2019 filanqrwpi\u00b4av, with its implication of a pattern of universal\nbenignity. This su\u00b4gkrisiv makes clear Zosimus\u2019 agenda in telling the story in the\nway he does; he wants to give a picture of a Demosthenes whose oratory is prodigious\n95 Zosimus of Ascalon (Vitarum Scriptores Graeci Minores, ed. A. Westermann\n[Amsterdam, 1964], 297\u2013302, at 297) asserts without qualification that Demosthenes e\u0001 k\ngone\u00b4wn de` mh` pa\u00b4nu ti semnw\u02dcn proelqw`n toi\u02dcv au\u0002 tou\u02dc ta\u0001 kei\u00b4nwn sune\u00b4kruyen, because he wants to\npresent Demosthenes as an all but superhuman qei\u02dcov a\u0001 nh\u00b4r whose triumph over his humble\norigins is therefore only to be expected. Demosthenes himself would seem to have deployed\na similar piece of sunoikei\u00b4wsiv, if Rutilius Lupus\u2019 excerpt at De figuris 2.9 is genuine.\n96 For example, A. B. Bosworth, \u2018History and artifice in Plutarch\u2019s Eumenes\u2019, in P. Stadter\n(ed.), Plutarch and the Historical Tradition (London, 1992), 56\u201389.\n97 This passage is difficult textually. The manuscripts lack a\u0001 fei\u00b4v, which Wolf inserts from\nPhotius. Some surgery is clearly required, but Photius\u2019 reading is still problematic, as it is\nperhaps doubtful whether a\u0001 rguri\u00b4ou and ca\u00b4ritov can stand as bare genitives of cause, even in\n[Plutarch]\u2019s idiosyncratic Greek. Perhaps e\u0004 neka has fallen out after a\u0001 rguri\u00b4ou?\n98 Plut.

P ITCHER232\neven at this early stage in his career, and it is noteworthy that he drives this point about\nDemosthenes\u2019 precocious stature home by having his hero refer to himself by\nname.102 This treatment thus follows on nicely from a version of earlier events\nwhich consistently emphasizes the youth\u2019s precocity; Zosimus\u2019 Demosthenes, for\nexample, turns to oratory while still a lad in order to punish his guardians, whose\nfraud he has already detected.103\nPlutarch\u2019s treatment is more subtle. He is not really interested in the monetary\naspect of the business, and his reference to it is correspondingly vague, although\none may note that his insistence that Demosthenes did not manage to win back all\nhis birthright fits in with his general treatment of the orator\u2019s early years as full of\npainful toil and hard-won success, in marked contrast to that of Cicero.104 His\nconcern is rather with the tastes which the experience wakens in Demosthenes;\nto\u00b4lman de` pro`v to` le\u00b4gein . . . labw\u00b4n, kai` geusa\u00b4menov th\u02dcv peri` tou`v a\u0001 gw\u02dcnav\nfilotimi\u00b4av kai` duna\u00b4mewv, e\u0001 pecei\u00b4rhsen . . . ta` koina` pra\u00b4ttein.

The conjunction of filotimi\u00b4av and\nduna\u00b4mewv likewise looks back to the two grounds on which Demosthenes admired\nCallistratus: e\u0001 kei\u00b4nou me`n e\u0001 zh\u00b4lwse th`n do\u00b4xan . . . tou\u02dc de` lo\u00b4gou ma\u02dcllon e\u0001 qau\u00b4mase . . .\nth`n \u0001 iscu`n pa\u00b4nta ceirou\u02dcsqai kai` tiqaseu\u00b4ein pefuko\u00b4tov.107 The juxtaposition therefore\nneatly recapitulates for the reader the tension that Plutarch is plotting between\nDemosthenes\u2019 unambiguously admirable devotion to rhetoric as something that can\ndo things, compelling people to virtue through its du\u00b4namiv,108 and his less praise-\nworthy yearning for immediate do\u00b4xa, an outlook the limitations of which are made\nclear near the beginning of this work,109 and laid bare more thoroughly in the accom-\npanying Life of Cicero.110 It is worth noting that filotimi\u00b4a is by no means an unam-\nbiguous good in Plutarch\u2019s moral vocabulary.111\nSimilar powers of architectonic construction are evident in Plutarch\u2019s approach to\nthe orator\u2019s dealings with the elderly Eunomus and Satyrus.

Barnes (edd.), Philosophia Togata I (Oxford,\n1989), 199\u2013232, at 209\u201313, and the passages discussed therein.\nTHE LIVES OF THE TEN ORATORS 233\nbiographer\u2019s input is more illuminating, which makes this example an apposite one\nwith which to conclude. Both Plutarch and our author include a narrative of individ-\nuals consoling Demosthenes after a failure in the assembly, but as well as a change in\npersonnel, the nature of the advice and the crafting of the anecdotes differ. This\ninvites examination.\nThe most interesting aspect of [Plutarch]\u2019s narrative is Demosthenes\u2019 statement on\nthe importance of actio. There interest lies not in the material, but in the way in which\nit is framed. Demosthenes is fed his opportunity by an anonymous questioner and the\nexpression e\u0001 rome\u00b4nou au\u0001 to\u00b4n tinov . . . (845B).\nInvestigation reveals that this way of crafting an anecdote is not unique to our\nauthor. In Diogenes Laertius, it becomes almost a structural feature, whereby his\nphilosophers are given the opportunity to deliver themselves of a succession of\npithy one-liners.112 When Plutarch himself is brought into the equation as well,\nmatters become still more interesting. What one might, not entirely accurately,113\ncall the e\u0001 rome\u00b4nou de\u00b4 tinov formula turns up only once in the Life of Demosthenes,\nand that one occurrence is the work not of Plutarch himself but of Ariston, an\nauthor, like Diogenes Laertius, of lives of philosophers. Here it is Theophrastus\nwho dispenses the wisdom: e\u0001 rwthqe\u00b4nta ga`r o\u0002 poi\u02dco\u00b4v tiv au\u0001 tw\u00bc\u02dc fai\u00b4netai r\u0002 h\u00b4twr o\u0002\nDhmosqe\u00b4nhv, ei\u0001 pei\u02dcn. \u0004Axiov th\u02dcv po\u00b4lewv.114\nIt is therefore a tempting hypothesis that the e\u0001 rome\u00b4nou de\u00b4 tinov formula is a stage-\nproperty of the sort of antiquarian biography for which Diogenes is the best evidence\nand the rhythms of which are usually avoided by Plutarch in propria persona. It is its\nuse in [Plutarch] that is intriguing, since Demosthenes is not the only person to be\nasked this question in the Lives. The other is Isocrates at 838F, and his response is\njust as illustrative of the qualities of his oratory (in which [Plutarch], as we have\nseen, is otherwise little interested) as Demosthenes\u2019 is of his experiences in overcom-\ning his defects.\nThis example therefore puts us in the unusual position of using other texts to illus-\ntrate our author\u2019s ingenuity in adapting the characteristic tropes of the biographical\ntraditions that he inherited, rather than vice versa. In the hands of [Plutarch] (or of\nthe source from which these two passages were cribbed), what in Diogenes tends\nto be a mere opportunity for the exercise of putative wit is melded more organically\nwith the texture of the narrative. Wit is used to characterize, not merely to sparkle.\nThe last instance has therefore brought us back to the contention of this study\u2019s\nintroduction. None would argue that in terms of construction or stylistic control,\nThe Lives of the Ten Orators is in any way comparable to the works of Plutarch.\nHowever, the very heterogeneity of the piece, and the odd effects that are produced\nthrough the clash of so many ways of writing the stories of the men of old, make it\nvaluable to one who wishes to explore the modes of this writing which existed\noutside the work of a Plutarch. The Lives of the Ten Orators, this study has perhaps\nsucceeded in demonstrating, is an important and unduly neglected document of the\nancient world\u2019s facility for doing biography, to misquote Dickens, in different voices.\nUniversity of Durham L.
