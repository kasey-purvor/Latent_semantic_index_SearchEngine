It accounts for 60% of the groundwater used in \nEngland and Wales and 20% of the total water used in England and Wales (UK Groundwater Forum \n1998).   To protect and manage this unique resource it is essential to know and understand the variations \nof aquifer properties throughout the Chalk.   \n \nAgainst this background a three-year collaborative project between the British Geological Survey (BGS) \nand the Environment Agency (EA) was devised.   The aim of the study was to collect, collate and present \ninformation concerning the physical properties of the major aquifers in England and Wales (Allen et al. \n1997).  This included creating a database of available pumping tests for the major aquifers.  This paper \npresents an analysis and interpretation of all available Chalk data in the Aquifer Properties Database. \n \n \nOVERVIEW OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHALK AQUIFER PROPERTIES \n \nThe presence and development of fractures gives the Chalk the properties of an aquifer.  Without \nfractures, the permeability and specific yield of the Chalk would be negligible.  Furthermore, without \nsolution enhancement of the fractures, the high transmissivity of the Chalk would be impossible, and \nwithout further concentration of groundwater flow and dissolution of chalk, conduits and karstic features \nwould not be observed.  The Chalk is often referred to as possessing dual porosity (Price 1987; Barker \n1991; Price et al. 1993).  In a classic dual porosity aquifer, the matrix pores provide the storage, and the \nfractures provide the permeable pathways to permit groundwater flow.  Groundwater movement within \nthe Chalk is more complex: the high porosity (produced by the coccoliths) is not readily drained, due to \nthe very small pore throats (Price et al. 1976), therefore effective groundwater storage is primarily within \nthe fracture network and the larger pores. \n \nThe distribution of aquifer properties in the Chalk has been roughly known for at least the past 50 years. \nWoodland (1946) in a study of the hydrogeology of East Anglia, recognised the relation between \nQJEGH 34:371-384\n \nAlan MacDonald Page 3 of 26 submitted QJEGH \ntransmissivity and topography.  Ineson (1962) estimated transmissivity from specific capacity data to \nproduce maps of transmissivity variation over the Chalk.  The most pronounced feature of these was the \ncorrespondence of high transmissivity values with valley bottoms - with particularly high values at valley \nconfluences.  In East Anglia, Ineson suggested that the effect persisted downdip where the Chalk was \noverlain by younger deposits.  Other maps of transmissivity have been produced for the London Basin \n(Water Resources Board 1972) and the Kennet Valley (Owen & Robinson 1978).  More recently, there \nhas been a renewed interest in the regional distribution of aquifer properties due to numerical models (e.g. \nRushton et al. 1989; Cross et al. 1995).  These models require information on aquifer properties from the \ninterfluves as well as from the valley bottoms. \n \nMany factors have contributed to the development of aquifer properties within the Chalk  (Figure 1).  The \ngeneral topographic pattern of transmissivity variation has developed through a number of processes: the \nconcentration of groundwater flux within valleys (Rhoades & Sinacori 1941; Robinson 1976; Owen & \nRobinson 1978; Price 1987; Price et al. 1993); the structure of the Chalk (Ineson 1962; Water Resources \nBoard 1972; Price 1987; Price et al. 1993); and periglacial erosion, particularly within taliks \n(Higgenbottom & Fookes 1971; Williams 1980; Gibbard 1985; Williams 1987; Younger 1989).  \nSuperimposed upon the general distribution are other effects which sometimes result in high permeability \nand even karstic behaviour (Banks et al. 1995; MacDonald et al. 1998).  The lithology of the Chalk has an \nimportant effect on aquifer properties, especially the presence of marl layers, flints or hardgrounds (Price \n1987; Buckley et al. 1989; Lowe 1992; Mortimore 1993; Bloomfield 1997).  The local structure of the \nChalk can also affect the aquifer properties, depending on whether significant fracturing has developed \nand also the presence or absence of fault gouge (Houston et al. 1985; Giles & Lowings 1990;  Mortimore \n1993).  Palaeogene, or other younger cover, can be instrumental in developing solution features and \ngroundwater conduits, as can the recent or historic presence of rivers, and periglacial activity (Fagg 1958; \nAtkinson & Smith 1974; Walsh & Ockenden 1982; Price et al. 1992; Banks et al. 1995; MacDonald et al. \n1998; Lamont-Black & Mortimore 1999).  Hiscock & Lloyd (1992) report the importance of glacial till \nwithin East Anglia in restricting groundwater flow and therefore the development of transmissivity.   \nQJEGH 34:371-384\n \nAlan MacDonald Page 4 of 26 submitted QJEGH \nBuried channels within the Chalk of East Anglia also affect Chalk aquifer properties, however their effect \non the hydrogeology is variable and dependent on the composition of the fill (Foster & Robertson 1977).  \n \n \nCHALK PUMPING TEST DATA \n \nData Collection \n \nVarious data from Chalk pumping tests were collected as part of the BGS\/EA Aquifer Properties Review \n(Allen et al. 1997).  Data were collected primarily from test pumping reports and files kept at regional \nEnvironment Agency offices, with some additional data from Water Companies and BGS records.  \nRequisite data for each test included the location and national grid coordinates of the test, the aquifer \ntested, and at least one measurement of transmissivity or storage coefficient.  Secondary data were \ncollected and databased including: pump test details (e.g. date, rest-water-level, pumping-water-level, test \nlength, pumping rate, presence of observation boreholes, test analysis details etc.); borehole construction \ndetails (e.g. diameter, depth, casing depth etc.); and comments on the data with a subjective measure of \nconfidence in the test results.  Auxiliary data were also collected but not digitised; these generally \nconcerned the availability of geophysical logs and depths to fractures. \n \nData pre-analysis and quality  \n \nApproximately 6000 estimates of transmissivity were recorded from 2200 pumping tests; 3000 estimates \nof storage coefficient were collected from about 1300 tests.  Such a large number of duplicate estimates \nfor each pumping test is primarily due to two factors: (1) data being analysed from various observation \nboreholes; and (2) the variety of analysis techniques available for interpreting drawdown data.  For tests \nwith multiple estimates, a procedure was followed to identify single representative values of aquifer \nparameters for each test.  This gave priority to observation borehole data and interpretations using \nQJEGH 34:371-384\n \nAlan MacDonald Page 5 of 26 submitted QJEGH \nappropriate analysis.  This procedure was followed to give a single estimate of transmissivity for each of \nthe 2200 tests.  The database was audited to ensure that the calculated single values were not spurious \n(Allen et al. 1997). \n \nThe quality of pumping tests was highly variable.  Some estimates of transmissivity were calculated from \ndrawdown monitored in dedicated observation boreholes over several weeks of highly controlled \npumping. Others were made from measured drawdown in an abstraction borehole after one or two hours \nof erratic pumping.  A general assessment of the quality of pumping test data was made during data \ncollection where there was sufficient raw data to make a judgement. This was a subjective measure, based \non factors such as variations in pumping rate, or the fit of data to the model used in analysis (Allen et al. \n1997).  Therefore, a quality rating could only be given where there was access to original data, and data \ncollection was made by a qualified hydrogeologist.  Quality ratings were obtained for 1180 tests \n(approximately 56% of the data).  These were roughly normally distributed over the quality range (see \nFigure 2).  Twenty-two percent of the tests for which it was possible to estimate quality, were rated as \ngood or very good, and 12% as very poor.  The bulk of the quality ratings were moderate or fair. \n \nFor each value of transmissivity in the database, the source of the data was indicated; for example, a \nconstant rate test of more than 1 day, or a constant rate test with observation boreholes.  Figure 3 shows \nthe impact of the type of test on the measured value of transmissivity.  Highest estimates of transmissivity \nwere obtained using constant rate tests with: (1) observation borehole data; or (2) a high degree of \nsubjective quality; or (3) durations longer than one day.  Data with these characteristics also varied the \nleast from test to test and location to location.  This trend is unlikely to be due to inherent bias from the \ndifferent pumping test methods, but probably reflects the natural clustering of good quality pumping tests \nto the more productive areas of the Chalk aquifer.  Much lower estimates of transmissivity were estimated \nfrom constant rate tests that were: (1) carried out for less than a day; or (2) of very poor quality; or (3) had \nno information about the source of the data.  The variance of test results was also significantly higher \nfrom data with these characteristics.   Data from these poorer pumping tests, however, are of particular \nQJEGH 34:371-384\n \nAlan MacDonald Page 6 of 26 submitted QJEGH \nvalue in describing Chalk aquifer properties.  Short tests are often conducted in small farm boreholes or \npilot and observation boreholes.  Some of these boreholes are abandoned after the first test because of low \nyields, or in the case of a farm borehole, a long test is not required.  The true value of these tests is their \nlocation - away from the main producing valleys and scattered throughout the Chalk outcrop.  Therefore, \nit was considered important to keep these poorer quality data within the data set \u2013 and not to remove them \nin favour of the better data.  Only by including these tests can indication be given of the aquifer properties \nof the Chalk in the less developed areas.  \n \nMore than one pumping test had been carried out at several hundred boreholes.  Duplicate pumping tests \nin single boreholes were kept as separate entries in the dataset in order to reflect the three dimensional \nvariation in Chalk aquifer properties.  Transmissivity can vary non-linearly with depth, therefore with \nonly a few metres change in water-level the aquifer properties can alter significantly.   At over 90% of the \nsites, transmissivity measurements changed by more than 25% between different tests.  Therefore it was \nthought that the range in Chalk aquifer properties would be better reflected by keeping different tests on \nthe same borehole as separate entries in the dataset.  However, if one of the tests was of particularly poor \nquality (i.e. given a low confidence value in the data collection), or from a step drawdown test, it was \nomitted.  A few boreholes had many (>10) pumping tests carried out on them.  At these sites the number \nof tests included was reduced to avoid unnecessarily biasing the data. \n \nGeneral Statistics \n \nThe filtering process reduced the dataset to 2100 measurements of transmissivity and 1200 estimates of \nstorage coefficient.  The distribution of transmissivity measurements is given in Figure 4 and of storage \ncoefficient measurements in Figure 5.  Both distributions give the appearance of log-normality.  However, \ntesting the data for normality using a Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test indicated that neither dataset truly \nfollows a log-normal distribution.  \n \nQJEGH 34:371-384\n \nAlan MacDonald Page 7 of 26 submitted QJEGH \nThe distribution of transmissivity measurements is shown in Figure 4.  The data are skewed towards \nhigher values.  The median value of the data is 540 m2\/d; the 25th and 75th percentiles are 190 m2\/d and \n1500 m2\/d respectively.  These data reflect the favourable aquifer properties in the Chalk.  However, data \nare heavily biased towards high value sites so should not be treated as indicative of the aquifer properties \nof the entire Chalk, but only of the measured sites.  The bias of the data set is discussed in more detail \nlater. \n \nEstimates of storage coefficient from 1200 tests are shown in Figure 5.  The data show slight bimodality \nand there are few estimates of storage coefficient less than 10-4 or greater than 0.1.  The median value of \nstorage coefficient from pumping tests is 0.0023, and the 25th and 75th percentile 4 x 10-4 and 0.01 \nrespectively.  Further investigation of the variation of storage coefficient in relation to differing degrees of \naquifer confinement is reported later. \n  \nSpecific capacity has been calculated for 802 boreholes which also have estimates of transmissivity.  \nCorrections were made for the radius of the borehole (Ineson 1959), but insufficient data were available to \ncorrect for non-steady state conditions.  However, since 75% of the specific capacity data were calculated \nfrom tests of more than 1 day, this error should not be large.  Acidisation of Chalk boreholes has a large \neffect on the specific capacity.   Banks et al. (1993) show that for most Chalk boreholes, the removal of \nslurry by acidisation can increase the specific capacity by on average about 2 times and sometimes in \nexcess of 20 times.   Unfortunately, no information concerning acidisation is currently available digitally. \n However, since it is common practice to acidise boreholes drilled in the Chalk (Banks 1993; Monkhouse \n1995) it can be assumed that the majority of specific capacity data quoted is for acidised boreholes.  \n \nFrom the available data, a broad relation between specific capacity and transmissivity can be given for the \nChalk aquifer as a whole (Figure 6).  Regression of the data gives the empirical relation T = 12.5 (Q\/s)0.71 \nwith a significant, but weak correlation (r2 = 0.48).  This empirical relation differs from the widely used \nLogan\u2019s approximation, T = 1.22 (Q\/s) (Logan 1964).  The Chalk data suggest that Logan\u2019s \nQJEGH 34:371-384\n \nAlan MacDonald Page 8 of 26 submitted QJEGH \napproximation underestimates transmissivity at low specific capacity (Figure 6).  However, a study of \nspecific capacity and transmissivity in an alluvial aquifer found a similar relation to that of the Chalk data. \nRazack & Huntley (1991) found transmissivity to be related to specific capacity through the equation T = \n15.3 (Q\/s)0.67 for 215 boreholes. \n \nA summary of some of the additional data collected for the Chalk boreholes in the aquifer properties \ndatabase is shown in Table 1.  Most of the data have been found to have no significant statistical \ncorrelation with measured aquifer properties.  \n \nSpecial considerations for pumping test analysis in the Chalk \n \nMany authors have illustrated that classical pumping test analysis is possible in fractured rocks subject to \nseveral basic conditions (e.g. Snow 1968; Barker 1991). The approach involves the replacement of the \nfractured media with a representative continuum in which values of aquifer properties can be assigned. A \nsufficiently large section of the aquifer needs to be tested to ensure that a representative measure of \naquifer properties is given.  A borehole that does not penetrate the important flowing fractures will not \ngive a representative measurement of aquifer properties of the area.  This is especially important in the \nChalk where boreholes a few metres apart may penetrate different fracture systems and consequently give \nvery different measures of aquifer properties.  \n \nThe location of observation boreholes is also important for pumping test analysis in the Chalk.  Spurious \ninterpretations can be given if observation boreholes intersect a different fracture system from the \nabstraction borehole.  In the Chalk, this can often occur in dry valleys.  Observation boreholes on the side \nof the valley may not respond at all to pumping within the valley floor.  Interpretation may suggest a very \nhigh transmissivity perpendicular to the valley, when in reality the opposite is the case. \n \nAnother important factor to consider when analysing pumping tests within the Chalk is the time scale over \nQJEGH 34:371-384\n \nAlan MacDonald Page 9 of 26 submitted QJEGH \nwhich water moves in response to pumping.  In many pumping tests, a delayed yield response is observed \neven where the Chalk is not overlain by another aquifer (MacDonald 1997; Jones et al. 1993).  This \nsuggests that extra water is being added to the aquifer during pumping complicating the analysis.  The \nsource of this water is unclear, but may be due to leakage from the unsaturated zone (Price et al. 2000), \nleakage from the Chalk at depth, recharge from constant head boundaries or water moving from the \nmatrix and smaller fractures to the larger flowing fractures. \n \nData bias \n \nThe distribution of all available data is shown in Figure 7.  It is immediately apparent that the data are not \nevenly spread over the Chalk outcrop.  The majority of the data are clustered within East Anglia, with a \nmuch lower density over the Hampshire and Thames Basins and to the north in Yorkshire and \nLincolnshire.  This reflects the higher demand for groundwater in East Anglia, for both public water \nsupply and irrigation. \n \nAt a catchment scale, data are even less randomly distributed.  Throughout the Chalk outcrop, boreholes \n(and therefore aquifer properties data) tend to be clustered within valleys.  Few boreholes are drilled for \nthe sole purpose of measuring aquifer parameters.  Generally boreholes are drilled for water supply; \npumping tests are then carried out to estimate the likely behaviour of the borehole under various \nscenarios.  Consequently, boreholes are located in areas where demand for groundwater is high and the \naquifer properties favourable \u2013 usually valleys. \n \nThis bias towards favourable aquifer conditions creates a significantly unbalanced dataset.  For example, \nthe median of all transmissivity values calculated for the 2100 pumping tests in the Chalk is \napproximately 540 m2\/d; this implies that a borehole drilled at random into the Chalk would have a 50% \nprobability of gaining a transmissivity of greater than 540 m2\/d.  This is patently not the case over most of \nthe outcrop area of the English Chalk.  \nQJEGH 34:371-384\n \nAlan MacDonald Page 10 of 26 submitted QJEGH \n \nThere is little that can be done to redress the bias in the data set, without deliberately drilling and testing \nlow yielding areas.  However, several small steps were taken to try and ensure that the bias was not \ncompounded.  First, to combat the undue emphasis of data in East Anglia, the data were split into smaller \nunits according to physical features rather than data distribution.  Thus, the data were divided into four \nsubsets taking into account the depositional, structural and glacial history.  The bias towards high yielding \nvalley sites is particularly problematic.  There are very few pumping tests in interfluve areas, and those \nthat do exist tend to be poor quality tests from farm boreholes or abandoned trial boreholes.  Good \nquality, data rich, tests are generally only carried out on highly productive boreholes.   As discussed \nabove, the pre-analysis of the data was designed in such a way that poorer quality tests carried out in low \nyielding areas were not removed from the dataset.  However, these small steps still leave the data highly \nbiased.  It is therefore important to recognise that the data are representative of measured sites rather than \nthe Chalk aquifer as a whole.  \n \n \nDATA TRENDS AND INTERPRETATION \n \nRegional Distribution of aquifer properties \n \nThe Chalk outcrop has been divided into four different geographical regions to help the description and \nanalysis of the aquifer properties distribution.  Various factors were considered including the depositional, \nstructural and glacial history (Bloomfield et al. (1995) used the same divisions in describing trends in the \nmatrix properties of the Chalk).  As discussed above, by dividing the Chalk on physical grounds, some of \nthe problems arising from the clustering of the data should be overcome.  The four regions are: (1) \nSouthern; (2) the Thames Basin (including the North Downs); (3) East Anglia; and (4) Yorkshire and \nLincolnshire (Figure 8).  The distribution of transmissivity and storage coefficient data (test values) for \nthe four regions are shown in Figure 9 and 10. \nQJEGH 34:371-384\n \nAlan MacDonald Page 11 of 26 submitted QJEGH \n \nThe transmissivity distribution shows broad similarities over the four regions.  Data approximate to a log-\nnormal distribution in all regions, but are not truly log-normal as defined by the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff \nnormality test.  There is a scattering of data points extending to low transmissivity, but the high \ntransmissivity tail is cut off abruptly.  This truncation reflects both the difficulties in measuring extremely \nhigh transmissivity values and the physical impracticability of gaining high values due to turbulent flow. \n \nTo help identify differences between the data distributions for the four regions, the cumulative frequency \ndistributions are re-plotted together on Figure 11.  Data from each region were also compared using the \nMann-Whitney test for non-parametric data.  This indicated that the data samples from Thames and East \nAnglia had a 95% probability of being from the same population.  No other statistically meaningful \ncorrelation was found between data from other regions.   \n \nFrom the cumulative frequency plots on Figure 11 it is apparent that data from Yorkshire and \nLincolnshire show distinctly different aquifer properties from the rest of the Chalk.  Transmissivity is \nsignificantly higher (median 1800 m2\/d) and the storage coefficient much lower (see Figure 10).  The \nstorage coefficient shows bimodality, representing a clear distinction between confined and unconfined \nChalk.  (The variation of storage coefficient from confined to unconfined conditions is discussed in more \ndetail later).  Even accounting for much of the data being from the confined aquifers, the measurements of \nstorage coefficient are lower than for other areas of the Chalk. These different aquifer properties \ndemonstrate the distinctiveness of the northern Chalk.   As discussed above, data from East Anglia and \nThames have similar distributions of transmissivity (median 410 m2\/d and 580 m2\/d respectively) and \nstorage coefficient.  Both areas have a high degree of exploitation, therefore probably have more data \nfrom poorer yielding areas of Chalk.  Data from the South indicate higher transmissivity than East Anglia \nand Thames (median 1000 m2\/d), but similar estimates of storage coefficient. \n \nThe data were subdivided into 17 smaller areas to try to investigate further the regional distribution \nQJEGH 34:371-384\n \nAlan MacDonald Page 12 of 26 submitted QJEGH \n(Figure 8).  Again, the subdivisions were made on purely physical grounds, comprising either discrete \nblocks or catchments.  Summary data for the areas are shown in Table 2 and Figure 12.  Yorkshire and \nLincolnshire again show high transmissivity values.  The high transmissivity values for the Southern area \nare shown to be caused mainly by pumping tests in the Salisbury Plain and Hampshire.  Relatively few \nlocations have been tested in these areas, therefore the data may be biased towards higher yielding areas.  \nGiles and Lowings (1990) suggested a link between folding in the Hampshire area and high \ntransmissivity.  However, the lower transmissivity areas of Dorset and the South Downs have been \nsubjected to more folding than either Hampshire or Salisbury Plain.  Clearly other mechanisms must also \nbe significant.  Lowest median transmissivity values are found in the London area, East Norfolk and East \nSuffolk.  These three areas of the Chalk aquifer have significant cover and are in some places confined.  \n \nVariations in storage coefficient across the outcrop are shown in Figure 12b.  Lincolnshire has \nsignificantly lower storage than other areas of Chalk.  Although the Chalk in Lincolnshire is largely \nconfined, other areas with much confined data (such as London, East Norfolk and East Suffolk) show \nmuch higher values of storage coefficient.  The most plausible explanation for the low storage in \nLincolnshire, is the different chalk lithology.  Lower porosity and harder Chalk (Foster & Crease 1974; \nBarker 1994; Bloomfield 1995) will significantly reduce the elastic storage.  Since confined storage \ndepends wholly on elastic storage, the measured storage coefficient would be very low.  However, when \nthe northern Chalk becomes unconfined (such as in the Yorkshire Wolds, gravity drainage from fractures \nbecomes significant and the measured storage coefficient becomes less dissimilar to those measured in \nareas of softer Chalk. \n \nA distinct correlation is observed between transmissivity and storage coefficient in Figure 12.  To explore \nthe nature of this relationship, median transmissivity and storage coefficient for each area are cross plotted \nin Figure 13.  This clearly demonstrates that median transmissivity and storage coefficient for each area \nare directly related.  Only Lincolnshire lies outside this trend, which may again point to a reduction in \nelastic storage in the northern Chalk.  The general trend observed for all other areas demonstrates the \nQJEGH 34:371-384\n \nAlan MacDonald Page 13 of 26 submitted QJEGH \nimportance of fractures for both storage and transmissivity. \n \nValley\/interfluve \n \nIt has long been accepted that borehole yields in the Chalk are higher in valleys than over interfluves and \nthat transmissivities tend to follow a similar pattern (e.g. Woodland 1946; Ineson 1962).  It is therefore \npertinent to examine the extent to which the pumping test data set support this experience. \n \nOne of the easiest ways to test variations in transmissivity from valley to interfluve is to examine the \ncorrelation between transmissivity and depth to rest-water-level (RWL), as RWLs are shallower in valleys \nthan interfluves.  However when this analysis was performed on the Chalk data no significant correlation \nwas found.  The reason for this is probably the significant bias in the data set to valley sites, as discussed \nearlier.  In order to minimise this bias therefore, an area was chosen that had a reasonable spread of data \naway from the high yielding valleys.  A suitable area was the Kennet Valley, where the Chalk was subject \nto a large investigation in the 1970's as part of the Thames groundwater scheme (Thames Water Authority \n1978).  During this study a series of abstraction and observation boreholes were drilled, some of which \nwere deliberately located in interfluve areas.  Consequently, the Kennet Valley is one of the few areas of \nChalk with a relatively unbiased spread of data. \n \nRobinson (1976) predicted transmissivity variations in the area under low water-table conditions using \nseveral factors  - primarily distance from winter flowing streams, modified by depth to minimum RWL \nand thickness of Upper and Middle Chalk.  He achieved a good correlation between the predicted results \nand those from high quality pumping tests carried out under minimum water-table conditions. \n \nThe current full data set was analysed for transmissivity trends within the Kennet Valley using a \nGeographical Information System.  Measured transmissivity values from pumping tests throughout the \nvalley were compared to four variables: distance from winter flowing streams, depth to RWL, saturated \nQJEGH 34:371-384\n \nAlan MacDonald Page 14 of 26 submitted QJEGH \nthickness of Upper and Middle Chalk and distance from Eocene deposits.  Multiple regression was used \nto find relationships between transmissivity and combinations of these variables.  From this analysis, \ndistance from winter flowing streams on its own was found to predict transmissivity best (Figure 14).  No \nother variable, or combination of variables, gave as significant a correlation (it should be noted however \nthat the correlation is still weak (r2 = 0.43)).  \n \nIt is concluded from the above that the data examined broadly support the traditional view of \nvalley\/interfluve transmissivity distribution , even when unfiltered for quality or factors such as test length \nor seasonal rest water level.  The correlations are, however, insufficient to be used for predictive purposes. \n This is probably partly because of the absence of rigorous data filtering and partly because factors other \nthan those considered (e.g. Quaternary history, degree of confinement, lithology) may be involved. \n \n \nConfined and unconfined conditions \n \nThe database was used to examine variations in both transmissivity and storage coefficient with the \ndegree of confinement of the aquifer.  A subset of the dataset was selected that had information available \non the degree of confinement of the aquifer.  The subset contained about 900 pumping tests with \nsufficient information available to divide the tests into confined, semi-confined and unconfined.  The \ngeographical distribution of this subset followed approximately the distribution of the entire Chalk dataset \n(with the exception of the northern area which had negligible confined\/unconfined information).  \nHowever, there was a slight bias in the data towards East Anglia for the confined data, and Thames and \nSouthern areas for the unconfined data.  Since the Thames and East Anglian data form approximately \n90% of the subset and have very similar data distributions (see Figure 11) this bias is not significant. \n \nNot surprisingly, the storage coefficient shows significant differences between measurements taken in \nconfined and unconfined conditions (Figure 15).  The median of confined pumping tests is 0.0006 and of \nunconfined tests 0.008; semi-confined tests have intermediate values.  A summary of the data is given in \nQJEGH 34:371-384\n \nAlan MacDonald Page 15 of 26 submitted QJEGH \nTable 3.  Values from confined Chalk agree with detailed research into Chalk storage undertaken by \nLewis et al. (1993).  They calculated the specific storage of the Chalk to be 1.5 x 10-5 m-1, which \nintegrated over a 100 m thickness of Chalk aquifer gives a storage coefficient for confined Chalk of \n0.0015. \n \nEstimates of storage coefficient from unconfined pumping tests are also broadly similar to those estimated \nfrom groundwater-level recession analysis by Lewis et al. (1993).  For the top 30 m of saturated Chalk, \nthey estimated the storage coefficient as 0.005 to 0.05, which compares favourably with the unconfined \npumping test inter-quartile range of 0.0028 to 0.017.  The slightly lower values from the pumping tests \nmay be attributed to delayed recharge from the unsaturated zone, which may not be observed in short \npumping tests. \n \nThe small difference between confined and unconfined storage illustrates the relative importance of \nelastic storage in the Chalk.  The Chalk aquifer is highly compressible (Carter & Mallard 1974; Price et \nal. 1993) hence the high estimates of specific storage by Lewis et al. (1993) and the corresponding high \nvalues of storage coefficient measured from confined pumping tests.  In unconfined situations, the \nspecific yield is limited by the small proportion of Chalk pores that can drain under gravity - less than 1% \nof the Chalk bulk volume (Price et al. 1976; Price 1987) and the limited volume of groundwater stored in \nfractures.  Therefore, in unconfined conditions, the elastic storage is still relatively important. \n \nTransmissivity measurements also show a distinct difference between confined and unconfined pumping \ntests (Figure 15).  Unconfined tests have an interquartile range of 310 to 2250 m2\/d (median 920 m2\/d), \nwhile confined tests have an interquartile of 66 to 620 m2\/d (median 220 m2\/d).  Semi-confined \nmeasurements of transmissivity were marginally higher than those measured under confined conditions: \ninterquartile range 115 to 720 m2\/d (median 280 m2\/d).  These data indicate that transmissivity is \nsignificantly more developed in unconfined Chalk than in confined or semi-confined Chalk.  This also \nhelps to explain the regional trends detailed in Table 2.  The areas with the lowest measurements of \nQJEGH 34:371-384\n \nAlan MacDonald Page 16 of 26 submitted QJEGH \ntransmissivity (East Norfolk, East Suffolk and London) are also the areas where Chalk is most heavily \nconfined; in East Norfolk and East Suffolk by Crag, and in the London Basin by Eocene deposits. \n \nSince transmissivity is largely governed by solution enhanced fractures, it is logical to conclude that in the \nconfined (and probably semi-confined) areas of the Chalk aquifer, the solution enhancement of fractures \nhas not developed to the same extent.  These data agree with Hiscock & Lloyd\u2019s (1992) study of \npermeability development in areas overlain by thick drift. They show that significant permeability \ndevelopment probably took place in the last 5000 years; however in areas covered by thick drift, or \nconfined by younger deposits, permeability would not have been significantly enhanced.  The origin of \nthe solution enhanced fractures observed in deeply confined Chalk is unclear.  They may have developed \nin Eocene times, and enhanced with groundwater flow during glacial periods; slow groundwater flux may \nalso help to enhance permeability.  Local development of solution enhanced fractures may be related to \ndiscrete outlets through the confining cover.  Some of these may have operated to greater effect during \nperiods of lower sea level and glaciation.  Palaeohydrogeological studies could greatly enhance \nunderstanding of the distribution of aquifer properties. \n \n \nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS \n \nThe collection and systematic databasing of pumping test data for the Chalk of England has allowed a \nunique opportunity for studying the Chalk aquifer.  Aquifer properties data exist for 2100 pumping tests \nin the Chalk.  The data are of variable quality; only 22% of the tests were rated as being of good or very \ngood quality.  The distribution of the data is also highly biased. The majority of tests have been carried \nout in high yielding valley sites, with little coverage over interfluve areas.  Although interfluve areas are \ngenerally low yielding, rapid contaminant pathways may exist (Allen et al. 1997, MacDonald et al. 1998). \nTherefore, to protect groundwater resources within the Chalk aquifer it is important to understand the \naquifer properties distribution in interfluves as well as valleys.  Knowing aquifer properties in low \nQJEGH 34:371-384\n \nAlan MacDonald Page 17 of 26 submitted QJEGH \nyielding areas is also important for building regional models of Chalk aquifer.  The lack of data in these \nareas introduces large uncertainty into these models.  Therefore, there is a need to carry out more \ncontrolled testing in low yielding areas. \n \nAnalysis of the 2100 pumping tests available for the Chalk aquifer shows that although the data \napproximate to a log-normal distribution, they are not truly log-normal.  The median value of measured \ntransmissivity values is 540 m\u00b2\/d.  Average measured transmissivity values are highest in the northern \nChalk of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire (median 1800 m\u00b2\/d) which may reflect the different diagenetic and \nstructural development of the northern Chalk.  Transmissivity values were also found to vary significantly \nbetween confined and unconfined sites.  Unconfined sites tended to have higher transmissivity (median \n920 m\u00b2\/d) than confined sites (median 220 m\u00b2\/d).  This may reflect increased solution enhancement of \nfractures under unconfined conditions.  Analysis of a subset with data available for both interfluves and \nvalleys showed a correlation between transmissivity values and distance from winter flowing strams. \nHowever, the correlation was slight, therefore factors other than distance from valleys must play a role in \ndeveloping aquifer properties. \n \nOne thousand two hundred pumping tests had estimates of storage coefficient.  Approximately one order \nof magnitude difference was recorded between confined and unconfined tests.  Estimates of storage \ncoefficient from unconfined tests had a median 0.008; and from confined tests, 0.0006.  The relatively \nsmall difference between the two measurements may be explained by the limited gravity drainage of the \nChalk, and therefore the relative importance of elastic storage in both confined and unconfined conditions. \n However, gravity drainage from fractures is still a significant component of storage.  This is illustrated by \nthe direct relationship that exists between transmissivity and the storage coefficient.  The fracture \nnetwork, which controls transmissivity, also largely controls the storage of the Chalk.   The Chalk in \nLincolnshire does not follow this trend.  This may be due to the lower elastic storage of the northern \nChalk, compounded in Lincolnshire by the fact that the Chalk is confined. \n \nQJEGH 34:371-384\n \nAlan MacDonald Page 18 of 26 submitted QJEGH \nUnderstanding variations in aquifer properties is fundamental to understanding and modelling how \ngroundwater and contamination occurs and moves within the Chalk aquifer.  This study has shown how \ngeneral trends can be seen from collating and interpreting all available pumping test data from the Chalk. \nHowever transmissivity and storage coefficient are only summaries of aquifer properties and are not good \nat predicting extreme behaviour, such as rapid groundwater flow, or complex behaviour such as matrix \u2013 \nfracture interaction.  Detailed field studies of various areas of the Chalk aquifer, such as interfluves and \nconfined areas, may help to explain why such variations exist. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis paper is published by the permission of the Director, British Geological Survey (NERC).
