However,\nthe nature and photophysics of triplet states in these materi-\nals is not well characterized. This is an important omission\nsince triplet states are generally believed to be the domi-\nnant species formed on charge recombination which yields\nelectroluminescence, the basis for both polymer light emit-\nting diodes and potential electrically pumped polymeric\nlasers. This is because charge recombination spin statistics\ndictate that only ca. one singlet exciton is formed for every\nthree triplet excited states (excitons) [5]. Thus, to be able to\nproduce better materials, more efficient devices, and gain\na deeper insight into these polymers, the basic characteri-\nzation of their triplet states is vital. Further, by comparing\nthe relative energies of the singlet and triplet \u201cgaps\u201d an\nestimate of the strength of electron-electron correlation in\nthese polymers can be made. In the case of strong correla-\ntion, the exciton model would be favored over a band pic-\nture as the description of these materials. However, such\nmeasurements are not trivial, due, in general, to the very\nlow intersystem crossing rates in these materials [6\u20138] and\ntheir low phosphorescence quantum yields [9]. Hence via\ndirect optical excitation it has not generally been possible\nto measure triplet energies [10]. Therefore, we have turned\nto an alternative route to produce triplet states in these\npolymers, one in which both the kinetics of the triplets\nand more importantly their energies can be measured.\nWe recently reported on the use of pulse radiolysis to\nmeasure the triplet energy in poly[2-methoxy,5-(20-(ethyl-\nhexoxy)-p-phenylenevinylene] (MEHPPV) [7]. We have\nalso demonstrated that charged states, again generated by\nthis method, have very different lifetimes and spectral sig-\nnatures from the triplet states [11]. We now report on\ntriplet state measurements on a range of the most widely\nused luminescent and conductive polymers in current dis-\nplay technologies; see Fig. 1. In general we find, as in\nacenes, the energy of the first triplet state, 1 3Bu, to be\ntypically 23 that of the first singlet 1 1Bu excited state, in-\ndicative of strong electron-electron correlation.\nSince the classic work of Terenin and Ermolaev [12],\ntriplet-triplet energy transfer has become one of the most\nimportant methods of specifically generating triplet states\nof organic molecules. Coupling this with pulse radioly-\nsis of solutes in organic solvents provides an excellent\ntechnique for the selective creation and study of both\nexcited states and charged species [13\u201315]. An intense,\n10\u2013100 ns pulse of electrons (accelerated to 10 MeV)\nfrom a linear accelerator irradiates the sample. The radia-\ntion chemistry of solutions is dominated by the most\nprevalent species in solution, the solvent [13]. The\nprimary excitation process involves ionization which\nin aromatic solvents such as benzene (BZ) is rapidly\nfollowed by charge recombination \u0001,1 ns\u0002, leading to\nexcited triplet and singlet state generation in the statistical\nratio 3:1 (in the benzene). By using appropriate energy\nacceptors \u0001A\u0002, such as biphenyl, having lower triplet\nenergies than benzene, short-lived singlet excited states\nand high S1 ! T1 intersystem crossing efficiencies, the\nexcited triplet state of this acceptor can be selectively\nproduced and subsequently transfer the triplet energy to\nthe molecule under investigation \u0001S\u0002, i.e., our polymers,\nsubject to the kinetically demanded concentration ratio\n\u0003Bz\u0004 \u00bf \u0003A\u0004 \u00bf \u0003S\u0004 [16]. This concentration gradient,\ncombined with diffusion controlled collisional triplet\nenergy transfer (in solution) ensures that effectively only\ntriplet energy is transferred down to the molecule under\ninvestigation. Transient induced optical absorption spectra\nare used to monitor triplet state grow-in and decay and\nground state bleaching. We have on the order of 20\nappropriate acceptors\/donors available to us [17] with\nwell characterized T1 energies ETA, each within 0.1 to\n0.2 eV of the next. A series of measurements are made\nto determine which acceptor transfers triplet energy to the\npolymer. When ETA , ETS no induced triplet absorption\nis observed since no triplet transfer to our polymer is\n1358 0031-9007\u000501\u000586(7)\u00051358(4)$15.00 \u00a9 2001 The American Physical Society\nVOLUME 86, NUMBER 7 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 12 FEBRUARY 2001\nS\nS\nS\nS n SS\nS\nS n N\nN\nN\nN\nn\n \nN\nN\nN\nN\nn \nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nn\n \nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO n\n \nO\nO\nOO\nO\nO\nOO\nO\nn\n \nN\nN\nN\nNO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO n\n \nO\nOO\nOO\nS\nSS\nS\nn\n \nN\nN\nN\nN\nn\n \nH\nH\nn\n \npoly(2,5-pyridinediyl)\n         (PPY)\n         \npoly(3-hexyl-2,5-pyridinediyl)\n             (HPPY) poly(3-octylthiophene)\n          (P3OT)\npoly(3-octyl-4-methylthiophene)\n                (PMOT)\npoly(2,5-hexyloxyphenylenevinylene)\n                (DHOPPV)\npoly(2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexyoxy)-p-phenylenevinylene)\n                                  (MEHPPV)\npoly(2-butyloxy-5-octylphenyl\n        -3-thiophene)    (PBOPT)\npoly(dioctylflourene)\n         (PFO)\npoly(2,5-octyloxyphenylenevinylene)\n                (DOOPPV)\npoly(2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexyoxy)\n         -p-phenylenecyanovinylene)\n                (CN-MEHPPV)\npolyemeraldine\n(PANi)\nFIG. 1.

For the range of acceptors\navailable to us we can estimate the triplet energy of the\npolymer to within 60.05 to 0.1 eV in most cases.\nTo verify the validity of this technique, a comparison\nto a direct optical measurement of a conjugated polymer\ntriplet state is needed. Recently Romanovskii et al. were\nable to observe weak phosphorescence from the ladder\npolyparaphenylene, MeLPPP [9].

We have now made a radiolysis experiment,\nin benzene solution at room temperature, on MeLPPP\nyielding a value of 2.15 6 0.1 eV. Given the small\ndifference between absorption and emission in solution\ncompared to solid state in MeLPPP this agreement is very\nsatisfactory and now gives strong support for the radiolysis\nmethodology. More details on these measurements are\nreported in a separate publication [18].\nTABLE I.

Triplet lifetimes in benzene solution\nare also given. It can be noted that the lifetimes for the\npolythiophenes are markedly shorter than those of the\nother polymers. This is in agreement with observations\non triplet states of oligothiophenes [19] and time resolved\ninduced absorption measurements on P3OT [20] and is\nconsistent with significant spin orbit coupling involving the\nsulfur atom in each repeat unit increasing intersystem\ncrossing. For CN-MEHPPV we find that a metastable\ntransient species (either an isomer or degradation product)\nappeared to have formed via the triplet state. Only an\nupper limit of ,2.6 eV can be made for the triplet energy\nin this case. All of the polymer triplet states except that\nof polyaniline emeraldine base (PANi) were quenched by\noxygen. Thus, for PANi it was possible only to estimate\nan upper limit on the T1 energy.\nTo determine if there are any general trends between\nsinglet and triplet energies and polymer structure, in\nFig. 2 we plot the 1 1Ag-1 3Bu \u0001S0-T1\u0002 energy gap against\nthe 1 1Ag-1 1Bu \u0001S0-S1\u0002 separation, as measured from\nthe maximum of the singlet absorption band. A very\nstriking linear correlation between the singlet and triplet\nenergies is found for the very different polymers studied\nhere. This is a very unexpected result. We note that a\nsimilar trend can be found with the acenes [21]. As a\nfirst approximation, for the conjugated polymers a least\nsquares fit to the data yields\nT1 \u0001 \u00011.13S1 2 1.43\u0002 6 0.25 eV .\nSeveral important points can be deduced from this find-\ning. The triplet gap decreases along with the reduction\nin singlet gap. By extrapolation it is possible to predict\nthat a polymer will have a triplet ground state when the\nsinglet energy gap is ca. 1.3 6 0.25 eV. For comparison,\nwith polyacenes it is suggested that the first member with\na triplet ground state will be nonacene [21]. From litera-\nture data, we estimate an energy for its lowest singlet state\nto be ca. 1.3\u20131.5 eV. The corresponding energies for the\nheterocyclic polyacenes may be even lower [22]. Thus the\nconjugated polymers would seem to behave in an identical\nfashion to the polyacences and by comparison the conju-\ngation length in polymers must be ca. nine repeat units.\nThe reduction of the singlet gap, i.e., the decrease in sin-\nglet exciton energy, as conjugation length increases is gen-\nerally accepted to imply that increased conjugation length\ndelocalizes excitations on the polymer chain. This is borne\nout in many experiments on oligomeric compounds; for\nexample, see Refs. [23] and [24], where it is found that\nthe DES\u0001L\u0002 \u0001 DES\u0001`\u0002 1 CS\u0005L, where DES is the singlet\ngap, L is the chain length, and CS is a constant [23]. As the\ntriplet states are essentially made up of the same orbitals\nas the singlets, a similar relationship should hold for the\ntriplet states; i.e., DET \u0001L\u0002 \u0001 DET \u0001`\u0002 1 CT\u0005L. For the\ncase where CT , CS the singlet-triplet gap will decrease\nas L increases. In our experiments, each backbone is dif-\nferent; thus the values of the constants in these relation-\nFIG. 2. Plot of triplet energy gap against singlet energy gap\nfor different polymers. Polymer acronyms given in Fig. 1. The\nline is a guide to the eye.\nships will be different. However, the general trend that we\nobserve for this broad range of conjugated polymers is that\nthe triplet gap decreases as the singlet gap decreases, i.e.,\ndelocalization increases, implying that CT , CS is true for\nconjugated polymers in general. Although we have studied\nonly three polythiophene derivatives, they do fit on a good\nstraight line; in these cases the backbone is the same and\nonly the conjugation length is different, caused by torsional\ndistortion from the sidegroups [25]. We are in the near\nfuture going to measure more of this family of polymers\nto verify these initial trends. The physical consequence\nof CT , CS is that the triplet states must be more tightly\nbound than the singlet states, i.e., more localized, but their\ndegree of localization is affected by the chain backbone.\nThis general conclusion is in agreement with the observa-\ntion of vibronic structure on the triplet-triplet absorption\nband, indicating a structurally relaxed triplet state [7,17].\nTheoretical predictions [26\u201328], work on model systems\n[9,10], and the observation of long-lived phosphorescence\nin a ladder poly(phenylene) [29] are also consistent with\nlocalized triplet states. In addition, it is difficult to ex-\nplain the relatively low triplet mobility on these polymer\nchains, or the observation of delayed fluorescence follow-\ning triplet-triplet annihilation [18], unless they are more\ntightly bound than the corresponding singlet states.\nThe large electron-electron correlation seen in all these\npolymers implies that the on site repulsion energy U is\nlarge. Abe et al. have shown that for the 1 3Bu to be ap-\npreciably lower than the 1 1Bu, the ratio U\u0005V . 2, where\nV is the long range Coulomb interaction [30]. In the case\nwhere U is large, the triplet electrons can be in the same\nmolecular orbital with a minimum of repulsion. This again\nis consistent with localized triplet states. In the solid state\nthis scenario would strongly support the exciton picture\nover the band model. As we find the same triplet energy\n1360\nVOLUME 86, NUMBER 7 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 12 FEBRUARY 2001\nin solution as is found in solid state for MeLPPP and also\nfind very little difference between triplet-triplet absorption\nenergies in solution and solid state, we assume that there\nis little change in the strong electron-electron correlation\nwhen weak interchain interactions are introduced in the\nsolid state.\nTo conclude, we have now measured the triplet ener-\ngies of a wide range of conjugated polymers, in the main\nthose predominant in the areas of light emitting devices.\nComparing these energies with the corresponding singlet\nenergy it can be seen that in all cases the triplet state is at\na much lower energy than the singlet indicative of a large\nelectron-electron correlation energy. A general trend is ob-\nserved between the singlet and triplet energy gaps. For all\nthe various types of conjugated polymers studied here there\nexists a linear relationship between singlet and triplet gaps.\nThe confirmation that triplet energies determined by our\nmethod yield very similar values to those found by phos-\nphorescence in the solid state allows the triplet energies\ngiven here to be used as a good guide to the triplet ener-\ngies in the solid state as well as the isolated chain case. Full\nunderstanding of electron correlation in the excited states\nof these conjugated polymers requires detailed quantum\nmechanical treatment, but the experimental data presented\non triplet energies represent both a challenge to theoreti-\ncians and a good starting point for high level calculations.\nOne very obvious initial prediction from this work is that\na polymer with a singlet gap below ca. 1.3 eV should have\na triplet ground state.\nWe acknowledge the EPSRC (GR\/M86040), PRAXIS\nXXI (Project No. 2\/2.1\/QUI\/411\/94), and the British\nCouncil \/CRUP (Project No. B-9\/97) for financial sup-\nport.
