In order to achieve this goal a form of discourse analysis will be undertaken using\nepistemological and scientific perceptions of knowledge and explanation. This approach is both unusual\nand unique but will illustrate some of the exclusionary suppositions which underpin analysis within\npublic law. The paper will conclude that only by adopting an alternative starting point for analysis, such\nas the use of concepts, will public law be able to incorporate alternative and critical approaches.\nI. Introduction\nThe aim of this paper is to explore why public law is able to include material, such as political theory,1\nyet exclude new and alternative materials, such as feminist critiques.2 Given the breadth and ambition\nof this question, it is proposed to use as the backdrop for the analysis the recent debate within public\nlaw concerning the nature of the subject, in particular, whether scholarship should be premised on\ntheory or values and the relationship of the subject to political theory.3 This debate involves three\ndistinguished public law scholars, namely Cane (2003), Craig (2003) and Loughlin (2005), and encap-\nsulates a diverse range of views regarding the nature of public law analysis. By confining the explora-\ntion to this clearly defined but high profile area of public law scholarship, the findings of this paper\nshould give a tentative indication as to the facilitative nature of public law.\nIn order to address the question of inclusiveness and exclusiveness, I will attempt a form of\ndiscourse analysis4 using epistemological and scientific perceptions on knowledge and explanation\n* A version of this paper was presented at the 2006 SLSA Conference. I would also like to thank the\nfollowing for their extremely helpful comments on earlier drafts: Professor Martin Partington, Professor\nTony Prosser and Chris Wilmore at Bristol University, Professor Martin Loughlin at the London School of\nEconomics along with Professor Hazel Biggs, Dr Bela Chaterjee and Dr Sara Fovargue at Lancaster\nUniversity.\n1 This paper will not engage in any discussion regarding which political theories have been included within\npublic law analysis. Instead, political theory, as a body of information, is used as an example of material that\npublic law has been able to incorporate.\n2 It is acknowledged that within feminist analysis there exists a wide range of views and approaches. However,\nit is not the aim of this paper to engage with such analysis per se but to use feminist critiques as an illustration\nof how public law is able to exclude material.\n3 This paper will not, in any way, attempt to extend the debate.\n4 No particular \u2018school\u2019 of discourse analysis will be adopted, as this paper does not aim to place public law\nwithin the wider domain of knowledge, legal or otherwise.\nInternational Journal of Law in Context, 2,4 pp. 377\u2013392 (2007) Cambridge University Press\nDOI: 10.1017\/S1744552306004034 Printed in the United Kingdom\nto identify the suppositions which underpin public law analysis.5 The use of such material is both\nunusual and unique. Accordingly, the structure of the paper requires some patience on the part of the\nreader. Much of the background material must first be laid before the reader, in particular the details\nof the \u2018theory and\/or values debate\u2019, its evaluation in terms of knowledge and explanation along with\nconsideration of the nature and relationship of knowledge and explanation. Once this material has\nbeen examined, the issues of inclusiveness and exclusiveness can be addressed. I will conclude by\nsuggesting that if public lawyers were to widen the range of mechanisms for the presentation of\ninformation, beyond that of theory to include conceptual analysis, then new and critical materials\ncould become part of public law scholarship.\nII. Background to the critique: the theory and\/or values debate\nThe \u2018theory and\/or values debate\u2019 emerged as part of a collection of essays in honour of the\nscholarship of Carol Harlow (Craig and Rawlings, 2003). Within the collection Cane (2003, p. 4)\nargues that debate about the relationship between public law and political theory has diverted\nattention away from \u2018legal values and on to styles of legal and theoretical scholarship\u2019. It is argued\nthat political values and theories are too abstract and there is also some disagreement concerning\ntheir understanding (Cane, 2003, p. 19). Furthermore by focusing upon political and moral values,\nalong with their relevance to legal analysis, public lawyers overlook the fact that law is itself \u2018an\nauthoritative (i.e. an authority-claiming) normative institution\u2019 (Cane, 2003, p. 18). In other words,\nlaw also possesses values which are \u2018immanent\u2019 in that they are implicit rather than explicitly\nstated (Cane, 2003, p. 14). It is the discovery of these \u2018more or less implicit background values\u2019\nwhich forms the basis of academic study of judicial decisions (Cane, 2003, p. 6). \u2018Foreground\u2019, or\nvalues which are external to law, such as the political theories of pluralism, liberalism and\nrepublicanism can help lawyers critically to assess law\u2019s own values but law also institutionalises\nor \u2018absorbs\u2019 certain political values with the consequence that the \u2018politically valuable becomes\nlegal\u2019 (Cane, 2003, p. 19).\nCraig\u2019s (2003) response to Cane is to criticise the positivist method by which Cane identifies\nvalues within public law. It is argued that the values identified are not immanent as Cane suggests,\nbut represent \u2018the values that public lawyers think are or should be important in a regime of public\nlaw\u2019 (Craig, 2003, p. 24). Craig continues that it is impossible not to consider the \u2018nature and object of\npublic law\u2019, \u2018central concepts of public law\u20196 and \u2018doctrinal issues\u20197 without recourse to political\ntheory. Craig also disagrees with Cane\u2019s (2003, p. 18) assertion that public law cannot make a\n\u2018distinctive contribution to our understanding of political values\u2019. Law, argues Craig (2003, p. 40),\nas \u2018an authoritative system, can mould values and make a contribution to the resolution of\ndisagreement\u2019. Furthermore, the \u2018abstractness of values and theory\u2019, which Cane (2003, p. 20) argues\nwill ultimately result in a \u2018point at which values and normative theory run out and need to be\nsupplemented by law\u2019, is addressed by Craig. The use of theory in any context, even the non-legal,\nrequires the implications of the theory to be considered (Craig, 2003, p. 43). This does not detract\nfrom the contribution theory can make \u2013 it may not provide answers, but it can enhance under-\nstanding (Craig, 2003, p. 46).\n5 The paper will not undertake a jurisprudential analysis in the sense of examining either the nature of public\nlaw or legal theory. Nor will the paper endeavour to employ such materials, or even non-legal approaches\nsuch as autopoeisis, currently used by lawyers.\n6 In particular parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law and the separation of powers.\n7 Doctrinal issues are represented as possessing two dimensions: a vertical dimension which is referenced to\nthe Diceyan model of \u2018unitary democracy\u2019; and a horizontal dimension where issues, such as the public-\nprivate divide, are reflective of deeper tensions within public law.\nB AR B AR A M AU T H E378\nThe debate is taken up elsewhere by Loughlin (2005, p. 48), who argues that the positions of Cane\nand Craig \u2018are in their own particular ways deficient\u2019 and that the debate \u2018is being conducted within\nnarrow and restrictive parameters\u2019. Loughlin contends that the debate fails to consider a crucial and\nbasic question \u2018what is public law\u2019? Unless the \u2018subject of the enquiry is clearly identified, discussion\nabout values or theory \u2018\u2018in\u2019\u2019 public law is likely to be confused and at cross-purposes\u2019 (Loughlin, 2005,\np. 52). Loughlin then offers a definition of public law8 and argues that, by representing public law as a\ndistinct form of \u2018discourse\u2019, the issue of theory and\/or values does not become the focus of analysis;\ninstead, they become the tools which are to be \u2018set to work within a defined field\u2019 (2005, p. 65).\nIII. Evaluation of the theory and\/or values debate in terms\nof knowledge and explanation\nThe method proposed to explore the facilitative nature of public law analysis, in the context of the\ntheory and\/or values debate, is through the use of epistemological and scientific perceptions on\nknowledge and explanation. This approach is both unusual and unique. There is, for example, no\nhistory within public law on the use of such materials. Nor does there even exist within public law\nspecific definitions as to what constitutes either \u2018knowledge\u2019 or \u2018explanation\u2019. These omissions are\nnot unexpected, given that the identification and presentation of either knowledge per se or\nexplanation per se represent issues of significance to epistemology and\/or philosophy. Given such\nabsences within public law scholarship, it could be argued that to deploy such a method is\ninappropriate, possibly impracticable or ultimately even unproductive. Yet, within scientific analy-\nsis, constant testing of a phenomenon is conducted using different methods in order to identify its\nfeatures. To continuously test using the same methods is not \u2018good\u2019 science, especially if it is known\nthat differences, or flaws, are to be found. Only by adopting new or alternative methods will the\nreasons for the differences, or flaws, be identified and possibly understood, thereby enhancing overall\nawareness of the phenomenon. Public law may not be science but the same approach of testing can\nbe applied. Accordingly, it would be \u2018bad\u2019 public law to dismiss an approach just because it does not\nfall within the established parameters of research either within public law specifically or law in\ngeneral. If the goal is to identify why certain materials are currently included or excluded from public\nlaw analysis, it may be that existing forms of \u2018testing\u2019 are part of the problem. Perhaps by adopting a\ndifferent approach the reasons which underpin the facilitation of material may be more easily\nidentified especially if the examination is confined to one particular area of public law scholarship.\nI will therefore consider the theory and\/or values debate in the context of knowledge, then in terms\nof explanation.\n(a) Knowledge and public law analysis\nThree knowledge-based approaches can be identified within the theory and\/or values debate: those of\nbelief, induction and falsification.\n(i) Knowledge as beliefs\nAn established epistemological definition of knowledge is that it can be conceptually analysed as\njustified true belief (JTB). A subject, X, knows that a proposition, Y, is true if, and only if X believes that\nY is true and Y is true; therefore X is justified in believing that Y is true (Ayer, 1956; Chisholm, 1957).\nThis definition was challenged by Gettier (1963), whose arguments have been generally accepted by\n8 Which Loughlin represents as \u2018a set of practices concerned with the establishment, maintenance\nand regulation of the activity of governing the state and that the nature of these practices can be grasped\nonly once that activity has been conceptualised as constituting an autonomous sphere; the political realm\u2019\n(2005, p. 58).\nPU B LI C L AW, K N OW LE D GE A N D E X P LA N AT I ON 379\nepistemologists and has resulted in the addition of a fourth element to the equation.9 The represen-\ntation of knowledge as beliefs, which are true and justifiable, possesses merit within the theory\nand\/or values debate particularly if allied with an additional parameter, a boundary.\nKnowledge as true belief can be found in respect of Cane\u2019s analysis. For Cane (2003, p. 9), true belief\nis represented by the immanent values which, even if they \u2018are not part of the law, are necessarily\ncongruent with existing law because they are read out of (or in to) it\u2019. Cane also argues that it is not\nnecessary to offer a particular theory as to how or why the beliefs are justified. Rather, \u2018law possesses\ninstitutional resources (in the form of legislative and adjudicative organs) that enable it to provide\ndeterminate answers to moral and political questions that would not be forthcoming\u2019 (Cane, 2003,\np. 20). What justifies the values as true beliefs is the boundary10 within which the beliefs can be\nfound. Ultimately knowledge, albeit of a wider or external form, and only this knowledge can\nelucidate upon the existence of the immanent values and, at the same time, justify their existence.\nThere is merit in representing public law analysis as true beliefs and their justification. Knowledge is\n\u2018internalised\u2019 to law, thereby facilitating the exclusion of subjective beliefs. This does not mean that\nthe model is completely closed. It is always possible to identify new true beliefs, in that the range of\nimmanent values can be widened, the problem lies in the removal of defunct or old values. Once a\nvalue is known, the only mechanism for its removal lies with the value being found to be \u2018false\u2019.\nHowever, the identification of even one false value could cast doubt on the validity of the remaining\nvalues, particularly as justification for the values is relational rather than absolute. Cane mitigates\nagainst this is by presenting the values as being as believable and as true as possible, thus making it\ndifficult, perhaps impossible, for their removal. A consequence of this approach is that the threshold\nfor the inclusion of new values is variable. New values which are similar to the existing values are\nmore likely to be included, because the possibility of them being believable or true is higher. In\ncontrast, new, but different, in particular non-legal, values are less likely to succeed, because the\nthreshold for believability or truth is lower. Ultimately, because the testing for believability occurs\nagainst values which are already known, new or different beliefs such as feminist critiques may be\ndeemed too remote from these established beliefs to represent true beliefs and thereby are easily\nexcluded. Conversely, the threshold for the exclusion of political theory is lower, possibly because of\nthe potential link between legal and political activity. The device used to facilitate this exclusion is\nthat of a boundary.\nThe idea of a boundary within a particular knowledge community is not unusual. In science, for\nexample, the notion has been used to demarcate the discipline from other varieties of non-science\n(Gieryn, 1989). The purpose of the boundary is to define the space that a particular knowledge\ncommunity occupies in terms of both the physical, that is the materials to be used, and the\nintellectual, how knowledge is to be disseminated and employed. In other words, boundaries define\nmatters which can be included as part of the rationalisation of knowledge and, at the same time,\ndefine matters to be excluded. This definition may appear to be somewhat simplistic, but boundaries\ndo not emerge overnight; they are a consequence of a complex historical development involving\nsuccesses, failures, ideology and even people. The theory and\/or values debate represents a form of\n\u2018boundary work\u2019 and within Cane\u2019s analysis two distinct boundary features can be identified. First,\nthere is the element of utility which should facilitate the inclusion of whatever forms of analysis will\nenhance public law. In the context of Cane\u2019s analysis, utility operates to affirm the flexibility of the\nimmanent values and at the same time exclude approaches such as political theory or even feminist\n9 Which is generally represented as K = JTB + G. K represents knowledge whilst the nature and content of G,\nthe fourth element identified by Gettier, has been the subject of much debate amongst epistemologists. Given\nthe breadth of discussion this would suggest that the nature of G is unspecific. See, e.g., Goldman (1967),\nLehrer and Paxson (1969), Kaplan (1985).\n10 See below.\nB AR B AR A M AU T H E380\ncritiques. The second boundary is the subject matter of public law. Here Cane is not so much\nidentifying what public law is, but is instead considering what it is not. Public law is not about\nthe merits of one theory over another, regardless of whether the theories are legal or political in\nnature. Indeed, allowing such a debate to develop \u2018has encouraged a certain pre-occupation with the\nviews of influential writers and with \u2018\u2018styles of public law scholarship\u2019\u2019 \u2019 (Cane, 2003, p. 9). Instead,\nfor Cane (2003, p. 9) the focus should be \u2018the sustained analysis of legal rules and values\u2019. Both of\nthese boundaries are interlinked and reinforce the exclusionary nature of knowledge as justified\ntrue beliefs.\n(ii) Knowledge by induction\nInduction is a system of reasoning that begins by observing particular instances of a general pattern\nand concludes that the pattern can be applied to all instances (O\u2019Hear, 1989). Inherent within any\ninductive argument is that the premise from which the analysis commences should ultimately\nsupport the conclusion. Furthermore, the more \u2018truthful\u2019 the premise is itself this will indicate, with\nsome degree of strength, that the conclusion is also true. An example of knowledge by induction can\nbe found in respect of Craig\u2019s analysis. The premise from which Craig commences is that political\ntheory possesses merit within public law analysis. This is supported by the nature and object of\npublic law (Craig, 2003, pp. 25\u201328), the relevance of political theory to legal discourse (Craig, 2003,\npp. 28\u201334) and \u2018doctrinal issues\u2019 (Craig, 2003, pp. 34\u201339).\nThere is merit to the inductionist approach. It captures in a formal and coherent way many of the\ncommonly shared views of public lawyers. Conversely, there is also the matter of how the knowledge\nfirst appears, from which the inductive analysis commences, along with that of judging its relevance\nfor inclusion. If knowledge is to be arrived at by induction then all arguments must be referenced to\nprior knowledge which also must have been arrived at by way of induction. This will in turn require\nan appeal to earlier inductive knowledge, and so on. Loughlin addresses the \u2018circularity\u2019 of the\ninductive approach, arguing that Craig fails to consider the correct initial question \u2013 \u2018what is public\nlaw?\u2019. However, the inductive approach also highlights the facilitative nature of public law analysis.\nEconomic and political theory are included because a connection can be construed through observ-\nations where patterns of a public law nature can be identified. Examples of such patterns are the\neconomic justifications for the contracting out of public services or the political background behind\na particular piece of legislation. Conversely, inducting a particular observation which can be viewed\nas feminist is more difficult. It may be possible to identify a feminist perspective in respect of the\nprovision of public sector services or a body of legislation but there is a distinction between a\nperspective and an observation. An observation represents a \u2018sighting\u2019 of the inductive premise,\nwhereas a perspective represents a view of the sighting. Accordingly, perspectives are, when\ncompared to observations, too insubstantial to be included within public law analysis. It can be\ncountered that Craig\u2019s \u2018central concepts\u201911 are not observable sightings but they are such an\nestablished and substantial part of public law that their exclusion would undermine the validity\nof any analysis.\n(iii) Knowledge and falsification\nAt its simplest, falsification is where the aim of analysis is not to confirm a hypothesis but to\ndisconfirm it (Popper, 1969, 1972, 1979). It is an approach that was developed as an alternative to\ninductivism. For the falsificationist, theories are created as speculative and tentative conjectures\nin order to give some form of adequate account of a particular phenomenon. The created theories\nare then rigorously tested and those which fail are replaced by further theories so that,\n11 See above.\nPU B LI C L AW, K N OW LE D GE A N D E X P LA N AT I ON 381\nultimately, only the \u2018fittest\u2019 theories survive. The surviving theories do not necessarily represent\nthe truth, they are just the best explanation available. As an approach, falsificationism developed\nwithin the context of scientific analysis. Its purpose is not to offer an understanding as to what\nconstitutes knowledge per se or to even provide for the discovery of knowledge. It is a method\ndevised for the \u2018moving forward\u2019 of knowledge within a particular realm. In this respect, aspects\nof the falsificationist approach can be found within Loughlin\u2019s analysis where moving forward\nentails abandoning the positivist approaches of Cane and Craig. For Loughlin (2005, p. 65), public\nlaw is a \u2018special form of discourse that sustains the political realm\u2019 and \u2018positivists, of what-\never variety\u2019 will never be able \u2018to offer a coherent explanation of what public law is\u2019. There are\nmerits to the falsificationist approach. It is an audacious way of introducing alternative material,\nin particular political theory, and possibly moving knowledge forward at a rapid pace. Yet,\nfalsificationism as an approach may be too bold within the context of public law where the\ndominant tradition is one of incrementalism and insights. In other words, boldness is ultimately\ntempered by tradition and therefore the inclusion of feminist critiques could be viewed as too\naudacious.\n(b) Explanation and public law analysis\nAs with knowledge, three explanation-based approaches can be identified within the theory and\/or\nvalues debate, those of realism, unification and finality.\n(i) Explanation and realism\nAn accepted view of realism is that there are objective facts which exist independent of the\nframework by which these facts are experienced or discovered (Chalmers, 1999). In the context\nof the theory and\/or values debate, it can be argued that Cane\u2019s analysis represents a form of\nrealism. The realism stems from the existence of the immanent values which represent certain core\nfacts which are both discoverable and expressible within public law, regardless of the adopted\nperspective and irrespective of the level of expression of the analysis. Consider, for example, the\nkey features of the values (Cane, 2003, pp. 16\u201317), such as the fact that \u2018the immanent values of\npublic law are a product of a complex interaction between legislative and judicial activity\u2019, the\nvalues \u2018reflect the particular features of the British constitution\u2019. These represent invariable factors\nwithin public law analysis. Furthermore, public law has progressed to this condition by way of\ntheories that are approximately true which, in turn, have also discovered some of the immanent\nvalues. In other words, Cane\u2019s analysis is merely the latest in a historical line in the development of\npublic law.12 There are merits to the approach in that it is forthright and provides for continuity,\nyet there are also flaws. There is a problem with the historical dimension, in that the future\ndevelopment of public law will be dependent upon past successes. This incremental approach\nmakes it difficult, but not impossible, to include political theory but is especially restrictive in\nterms of non-traditional materials, such as feminist critiques. Since inclusion will be based on the\nrelationship of the new material to existing material the relationship of feminist critiques may be\nviewed as being too tenuous, ultimately even unrealistic, in terms of current public law analysis to\nmerit inclusion.\n(ii) Explanation and unification\nUnification is where fundamental features of explanation, such as theories, are accounted for in\nterms of an alternative analysis (Kitcher, 1990). Craig\u2019s analysis represents a form of explanation as\nunification, in that the Dworkinian view of law is used to connect public law with political theory.\n12 The backdrop to Cane\u2019s analysis is the work of Carol Harlow. See Craig and Rawlings (2003, notes 1\u20137).\nB AR B AR A M AU T H E382\nThere is merit to unification. The approach provides the foundation for a more general theory of\npublic law. However, crucial to unification is the method by which it is achieved along with the\nimpact on the further development of analysis. In respect of Craig, unification occurs by way of\ninterconnectedness. Here features of one area of analysis meet with similar features in another. For\nCraig, this meeting occurs by way of moral and political values. The approach should provide for\nflexibility in terms of the development of future public law analysis, except that there are structural\nimplications attached to unification. The theory which enables unification to occur must be general\nenough to allow for unification, yet specific enough so that combining can occur. In other words,\nunification entails a cost in that only certain parameters of the combining theory will be drawn upon\nwhilst others will be discarded. This means that any criticism of the combining theory can become\nlost, although its flaws could remain and become transferred to form part of the new \u2018higher\u2019\nanalysis. In terms of alternative analysis, such as feminist critiques, the possibility of their emergence\ninto the domain of public law becomes even more remote. There are feminist critiques of Dworkin\u2019s\ndefence of liberal political theories (Schwartzman, 1999), but such criticism is unlikely to appear\nwithin the theory and\/or values debate since the aim of unification is to enhance Craig\u2019s analysis of\npublic law rather than Dworkian analysis.\n(iii) Explanation and finality\nFinality, or \u2018final theory\u2019, represents an explanation that underlies all other theories (Oppenheim and\nPutnam, 1958). The idea of final theory represents a form of unification except that unity is achieved\nby way of reduction, as opposed to convergence found in respect of Craig\u2019s analysis. The approach\nargues that the differences between all phenomena represent a matter of degree, rather than a matter\nof kind. Accordingly, there are no instances which can remain outside of a final theory nor can any\nother alternative explanations exist for the phenomena which are being explained. The notion of a\nfinal theory can be found within scientific analysis13 and Loughlin\u2019s analysis, particularly in respect\nof The Idea of Public Law (2003), represents a form of final theory. There is merit to explanation as\nfinality. In the context of Loughlin\u2019s analysis, unification occurs by means of phenomena, as opposed\nto theory, which means that the problems identified in respect of Craig\u2019s interconnectedness are\navoided. There are, however, flaws to be found particularly in respect of perspectives that are\ncurrently excluded from public law analysis. If a final theory of public law has been achieved, how\ncan feminist critiques ever achieve inclusion? The approach also assumes there is a level of compat-\nibility between all phenomena within public law. There is the possibility that finality could be\nachieved in respect a phenomenon at one level and at different level for another phenomenon. The\noutcome would thus not be unity, but disunity. This argument finds support within Cane\u2019s analysis.\nOne of the key features identified by Cane (2003, p. 16) was that \u2018public law values may be in\ncompetition with one another\u2019 such as \u2018transparency, with secrecy, executive authority with repre-\nsentation\u2019 and that ultimately \u2018public law reflects a plurality of commitments characteristic of moral\nand political life\u2019.\n(c) Conclusion\nA number of points thus emerge from the above analysis. There is confirmation that within public\nlaw specific definitions of either knowledge or explanation do not exist. Accordingly, there are no\nparticular restrictions regarding their use as a methodological tool. Furthermore, as a method-\nological tool, epistemological and scientific perceptions on knowledge and explanation have proved\nto be both practical and productive. It has been illustrative of a number of arguments essential for\nthis paper. The method has, for example, confirmed the wide spectrum of approaches to public law\n13 Such as the theory of evolution. Finality occurs in that every sub-discipline within the biological sciences\npremises its analysis upon the theory of evolution.\nPU B LI C L AW, K N OW LE D GE A N D E X P LA N AT I ON 383\nanalysis that can be found within the theory and\/or values debate. This would indicate that the\ndebate represents an appropriate basis for this study. The use of knowledge and explanation has also\ndemonstrated and affirmed the facilitative nature of public law. It was established, in the context of\nthe theory and\/or values debate, that public law is generally able to incorporate political theory, yet\nthe threshold for the inclusion of feminist critiques is either non-existent or so high that the\nparameters are almost unobtainable. However, the analysis, whilst functional and illustrative, does\nnot reveal why public law distinguishes between materials which can, or cannot, be included. The\nanswer to this question requires consideration of the nature of the methodological devices used, that\nis, knowledge and explanation.\nIV. The nature of explanation and knowledge\nKnowledge and explanation represent processes for the presentation of information, but they are\ndistinguishable. In simplistic terms, knowledge is about belief, what something is, whilst explana-\ntion is about understanding, why something is (Cornwell (ed.), 2004). The problem is that in respect\nof knowledge, belief will not necessarily provide for understanding, nor does a belief per se constitute\nknowledge, even if the belief is true, justifiable, inducted or represents the best possible explanation.\nAll that can be said about belief is that it is a necessary, but insufficient, condition for knowledge\n(Williamson, 2000). In respect of explanation there are similar problems (Hempel, 1965).\nUnderstanding can be achieved in a variety of ways; for example, by making a phenomenon real,\nfitting it together with other phenomena to become a unified whole, or presenting a coherent final\nexplanation. To understand a phenomenon it is also not necessary to possess belief. In other words,\nunderstanding is also a necessary, but insufficient, condition for explanation. How, then, does this\nrelationship between explanation and knowledge impact upon the facilitative nature of public law\nanalysis in the context of the theory and\/or values debate?\nV. The relationship between knowledge and explanation\nWhat is revealed from the above is that, between knowledge and explanation there exists a gap. This\nwould suggest that it is possible to utilise knowledge and explanation for the presentation of\ninformation, but that knowledge and explanation together will not represent a coherent analysis.\nInstead, knowledge and explanation represent two very distinct and separate forms for the presenta-\ntion of information. There is some justification in the existence of the gap. The gap protects the\ndistinctiveness of knowledge from explanation and vice versa. It is also not undesirable given that\npublic law does not offer, or contain, a definition as to what constitutes either knowledge or\nexplanation. The existence of the gap also suggests that there is an element of flexibility between\nanalysis as explanation or knowledge. At the same time, because there does not exist any valid\njustification for knowledge and explanation to coexist it is also acceptable to disassociate and\ndistinguish them. Given this range of possibilities, within public law one form can be found to\npredominate over the other, with the dominant method for the presentation of information being\nexplanation. This statement may appear to be simplistic and somewhat obvious, but there are\nimplications to be found, particularly in respect of the facilitative nature of public law. Before\nthese implications can be explored, it is first necessary to consider how explanation predominates\nwith particular reference to the theory and\/or values debate.\nVI. Public law analysis and the predominance of explanation\nThe reasons why explanation predominates over knowledge-based analysis are ontological and\nmethodological in nature.\nB AR B AR A M AU T H E384\n(a) Ontological differences between knowledge and explanation\nIn order to understand why explanation, as opposed to knowledge, is the dominant mode of analysis\nwithin public law, it is necessary to consider how explanation differs ontologically from knowledge.\nOntological differences relate to the nature of knowledge and explanation. Such differences are not\nmaterial in terms of the relationship between knowledge and explanation, as considered above, but\nmatter in respect of the purpose of analysis as either knowledge or explanation. If it is accepted that\nthe goal of any form of enquiry, be it as knowledge or explanation, is to identify the truth, whether in\nterms of cause or reason for being and that this process should be seen to be free, authoritative,\neffective and possess rigour, if these features are not present, then the outcome represents something\nother than truth. The imperative for any form of analysis is to be objective as opposed to subjective.\nKnowledge is by nature subjective, in that inherent within the very notion of a belief exists the\nelement of subjectivity. Beliefs are also propositional attitudes, in that they can have a causal role in\ngenerating an action. The causal role can occur on the part of an individual, but it can also occur as\npart of an enquiry. Beliefs as a causal role on behalf of an individual could, with some degree of\ncertainty, be regarded as subjective but the issue of subjectivity becomes less clear when beliefs are\nasserted as part of an enquiry. This would suggest that beliefs can be represented as possessing an\nelement of objectivity. Consider, for example, Cane\u2019s immanent values, Craig\u2019s premise along with\nthe fitness of Loughlin\u2019s analysis. As subjective beliefs it is difficult to separate the resulting analysis\nfrom the role of the analyst. It is after all the analyst who identified\/created them. These same beliefs\ncan also be found within analysis as explanation but they represent realism, unification and finality.\nThe issue of subjectivity dissipates because realism, unity and finality can be separated from the\nanalyst and are represented as part of the enquiry. The reason for this difference lies in respect of the\njustification attached to the beliefs.\nJustification relates to the reasons, arguments or evidence that supports an analysis. In respect of\nexplanation the justification for analysis relates to the process of enquiry. The direction that an\nenquiry takes is one of inevitability, in that if the goal of truthfulness is to be achieved, be it in terms\nof reason or cause, it would be unjustifiable, and ultimately untruthful, to adopt any alternative\nroute. There is a perception of no choice whereas, in respect of knowledge, the direction of enquiry\nrepresents an exercise of choice. Of course, the notion of no-choice in the context of explanation and\nchoice in the context of knowledge are challengeable. The subjectivity of choice, in respect of\nknowledge, can be mitigated against in that choice can be presented in terms of the status of the\nperson exercising choice. Cane, Craig and Loughlin are eminent academics within public law\nscholarship and therefore the exercise of choice on the part of such individuals will possess weight\nbeyond that of those with a \u2018lesser\u2019 standing within the realm of public law scholarship. It could be\nargued that there is no-choice.\nIn respect of analysis as explanation, the notion of inevitability can also be challenged in that at\nsome point within any analysis academics will have made a choice from a number of competing\nhypotheses. This \u2018theory choice\u2019 is structural in nature, in that it will determine the direction in which\nthe study is taken. In scientific analysis, theory choice is presented as occurring within a rational\nparadigm where considerations such as accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity and fruitfulness will\nform part of the judgement (Kuhn, 1977, ch. 13). Within analysis as explanation theory choice does\noccur. Consider, for example, Craig\u2019s use of Dworkin and Loughlin\u2019s use of functionalism. There is even\nthe choice by Craig and Loughlin to incorporate political theory within their analyses. Such choices are,\nhowever, generally represented as being premised in terms of the strength or weight a particular theory\npossesses which is then justified in term of rationality. Accordingly, theory choice can also operate to\nexclude theories which are perceived to be weak or lacking in weight, such as feminist critiques.14\n14 See below.\nPU B LI C L AW, K N OW LE D GE A N D E X P LA N AT I ON 385\nThere are consequences attached to developing analysis on the basis of choice or inevitability. For\nexample, should the resulting analysis be found to be flawed then choice can be perceived as \u2018bad\u2019\nscholarship with the consequence of immediate abandonment of the analysis. There is always the\nrisk, however much the notion of choice is objectified, that an element of subjectivity remains. This\nrisk becomes especially heightened if the chosen theory is perceived in terms of beliefs, such as\nfeminist critiques.15 In contrast, analysis developed as a consequence of inevitability, thus if the\noutcome is unsound, then the resulting analysis is not represented as bad scholarship but as \u2018flawed\u2019\nanalysis. The outcome for flawed analysis can at worst be abandonment and, at very least, the\nanalysis can be altered to accommodate the identified flaws. Within public law scholarship the\nabandonment of analysis is improbable,16 whereas accommodation is the norm.\n(b) Methodological issues and the predominance of explanation\nMethodological issues relate to the forms by which analysis is expressed, such as theories and\nconcepts. Public law analysis accords primacy to one method in particular, theory. Specific features\nare drawn upon, such as the authority and facilitative capacity of theory, which enhance the\nattractiveness of explanation, when contrasted with knowledge, and thereby affirm the primacy of\nexplanation. The authority of theory stems from its ability to resist dislodgement. In respect of\nknowledge-based analysis, this ability can be found to be especially weak. It is possible, for example,\nto dislodge Cane\u2019s analysis by establishing the falsity of any one of the immanent values although, as\ndiscussed above, this can be mitigated against. Realism, by comparison, can be adjusted to accom-\nmodate omitted factors. It is not a matter of inaccuracy, something which could overwhelm the\ntheory, flaws only appear when factors unobserved at the time of construction become observed at a\nlater date. The perception of what is real is adjusted to accommodate the newly discovered informa-\ntion. Beyond the theory and\/or values debate, the dislodgement of theory is very difficult, almost\nimpossible, even when it has been demonstrated that a particular theory is flawed (Mauthe, 1999,\n2000), or that the phenomenon under investigation is possibly too complex to be expressed in terms\nof theory (Mauthe, 2005a). It is suggested that this \u2018resistance\u2019 is partly attributable to the perception\nthat theory is the only valid mechanism for the presentation of information within public law.17\nThe neutrality of theory relates to the perception that theory is itself value free and produces\nvalue free analysis. In the context of analysis as knowledge, theories can never be represented as\nbeing value free since they are subjective creations. Within analysis as explanation, neutrality can be\naffirmed by the perception that the origins of theory are irrelevant, what matters is the applicability\nof theory. The functionalist approach, for example, originated in the natural sciences, was adopted by\nthe social sciences, initially by sociologists and then political theorists. The particular definition that\nLoughlin draws upon stems from political theory and it is irrelevant that functionalism has since\nbeen discredited within the natural sciences and sociology. This \u2018flaw\u2019 does not impact on the overall\nvalidity of explanation as finality whereas, in respect of explanation as falsification, this could result\nin Loughlin\u2019s analysis being dismissed as not representing the best explanation. This would suggest\nthat neutrality in the context of explanation offers a flexibility which cannot be found in respect of\nknowledge.\nTheory can also accommodate change. This apparent flexibility can be found to operate in a\nnumber of ways. Consider, for example, the inclusion of economic analysis which entered public law\nas a consequence of de-regulation. De-regulation resulted in a fundamental alteration in the role of\nthe state. It shifted the basis of decision-making in some areas from the political administrative\n15 See below.\n16 Consider, for example, the debate on sovereignty. See Walker (2003), pp. 3\u201332.\n17 See below.\nB AR B AR A M AU T H E386\nframework to the economic. For public law this meant a re-examination of the nature of rules and\ntheories of discretion (Ogus, 1994; Black, 1997). Furthermore, the resulting theoretical analysis on\nregulation was expressed in terms of explanation and not as knowledge. The reason for this was that\nchange, in terms of knowledge, represented an alteration in belief, something which could be viewed\nas absolute. In contrast change, in terms of explanation, represented an alteration to an under-\nstanding, something which is not absolute and is, therefore, flexible.\nVII. The implications of explanation led analysis within public law\nThe above affirms that explanation, as opposed to knowledge, is the preferred method of analysis\nwith public law. There are, however, implications to be found in respect of explanation led analysis,\nparticularly in relation to the facilitative nature of public law. These implications are also ontological\nand methodical in nature.\n(a) Ontological implications\nOntological consequences relate to the nature of the material that public law analysis can accom-\nmodate. Political theory appears to be accommodated because such analysis is viewed as being\nobjective in nature and it represents a form of explanation-based analysis, as opposed to a form of\nknowledge-based analysis. Furthermore, as explanation political theory can, or cannot, enhance\npublic law analysis according to the justifications for inclusion or exclusion. Consider, for example,\nthe differing approaches to the inclusion of political theory presented by Cane and Craig. The issue\nwas not the ability of public law to incorporate such material but the benefits of incorporation. This\napproach can be contrasted with regard to the inclusion of feminist critiques. There have been\nattempts to include such analysis within public law (Milns and Whitty (eds.), 1999), but the subject\nappears to be particularly resistant. The difficulty stems from the perception that such perspectives\nrepresent a form of knowledge as opposed to a form of explanation. Feminist perspectives represent\nsubjective beliefs and therefore cannot contribute to the development of public law analysis. Public\nlaw allows for the inclusion of new or alternative analysis, but such incorporation only functions in\nrelation to other forms of explanation-based analyses. This then raises the question, how have these\ndiffering perceptions, as regards political theory and feminist critiques, arisen? The reasons lie with\nthe perceived characteristics of each analysis.\nAt it most simplistic, the essence of political theory is the study of fundamental notions such as\nthe state or government along with the enforcement of authority. These are identifiable themes\nwithin public law. Where public law may differ is in respect of emphasis. In Cane\u2019s analysis, for\nexample, the emphasis is on the authority of law which is why alternative systems of authority, such\nas political decision-making, can be excluded. For Loughlin, the authority of political decision-\nmaking provides the background to public law analysis, and hence its inclusion. Apart from this\nsimilarity of shared notions, there is also the issue of a shared ontological tradition. Within analysis\nof political theory, there is a strong tradition of elucidating \u2018neutral\u2019 concepts, and of constructing\nmeanings to key notions such as the state and sovereignty without attributing a particular general\nphilosophical or ethical view of the world. It is an approach that is mirrored within Cane and Craig\u2019s\nanalysis. Cane overtly draws upon the positivist tradition whilst Craig, although drawing upon\nDworkinian interpretivism, ultimately shares Cane\u2019s positivist outlook (Loughlin, 2005, p. 52).\nLoughlin may argue for the abandonment of the positivist tradition, but the outcome of his analysis\nis an affirmation of the exclusionary tradition.\nBy comparison, what characterises feminist analysis in its broadest sense is the perception that\ngender is a category which is relevant in the study of any discipline. Analysis is premised upon a\nspecific belief and the goal is not that of neutrality, but the identification and critique of value. The\narticulation by the speaker on their position in relation to gender and the exercise of power is\nPU B LI C L AW, K N OW LE D GE A N D E X P LA N AT I ON 387\ndeemed relevant (O\u2019Donovan, 1985; MacKinnon 1987, 1989; Smart 1989; Edwards, 1996). There is\nthus an ontological dichotomy between public law analysis and feminist critiques which, on the face\nof it, appears to be irresolvable.\nThere are, of course, a number of possible solutions to this issue. One approach would be to\nchallenge the neutrality of public law analysis. The converse would be to \u2018objectify\u2019 feminist\nperspectives so that they can be viewed as a viable and legitimate form of explanation, comparable\nto that of political theory. Yet such \u2018de-politicalisation\u2019 would mean that the perspective ceased to be\nfeminist. Both approaches also contain one essential problem \u2013 it is necessary to consider what is\nmeant by the term objectivity. Yet, in order to identify what is objective, in the context of public law,\nit will also be necessary to consider what is subjective. This would raise epistemological issues which\nare relational but not necessarily of direct relevance to the development of public law analysis.\nFurthermore, given that it is explanation, as opposed to knowledge, which predominates public\nanalysis such an exploration would certainly be a weighty and complex task, possibly one that is\neven unattainable.\n(b) Methodological implications\nMethodological implications relate to the use of theory to inhibit the facilitation of alternative\ncritiques. This restrictive methodological approach can be found to operate in a number of ways.\nThere is, for example, the construction of theory upon theory, such as Craig\u2019s use of Dworkin, or the\ncreation of super theories, such as Loughlin\u2019s final theory. These approaches are not unique to the\ntheory and\/or values debate. Indeed, similar practices can be found in respect of analysis on\nthe central-local government relationship (Vincent-Jones, 1998, 1999, 2002; Mauthe, 2005) and\nother super theories include legal pluralism and constitutional pluralism (Walker, 2002). What makes\na theory \u2018super\u2019 is the perception that somehow these \u2018bigger and better\u2019 theories will resolve the\nanalytical tensions that exist within public law analysis. By compounding explanation-based analy-\nsis upon explanation-based analysis, the ability of any form of knowledge-based analysis, such as\nfeminist critiques, to enter into public law become more remote and maybe even impossible.\nA further effect of according primacy to theory is its proliferation. There are advantages attached\nto such proliferation, for example, it illustrates the breadth and complexity of the subject of public\nlaw. It also offers choice to academics. Yet breadth of choice can also be harmful because complexity\ncan come to be viewed as the norm with the consequence that any study which promotes simplicity\nrisks being dismissed as unacademic and possibly even detrimental to the long-term development of\nanalysis. Contrast this view to the approach within science where simplicity can be found to convey\ngreat complexity. This can be seen in, for example, the simplicity, yet the depth of complexity,\nconveyed within the equation E=mc2.\nAn additional outcome resulting from the proliferation of theory is the risk of incommensur-\nability. Incommensurability occurs when there is an abundance of theories, all relating to the same\nobservation or phenomenon and there is no agreement regarding the use or understanding of key\nterms or notions within the body of analysis concerned. The meaning of any term or notion can only\nbe determined by referencing the particular theory adopted to explain a particular phenomenon\n(Kuhn, 1996). The theory and\/or values debate can be viewed as a form of proliferation, and\nproliferation can also be found in diverse areas of public law analysis, such as the notion of\nsovereignty (Mauthe, 2005a), the central-local government relationship (Mauthe, 2005) and the\nrule of law. Within such areas of analysis there is little agreement as to what is meant by the nature\nof public law, the notion of sovereignty, the nature of the central-local government relationship or\nthe idea of the rule of law.\nThis proliferation and predominance of theory reinforces the established boundaries of public\nlaw analysis in that new material has to enter as theory or through theory in accordance with the\nexisting parameters of analysis as explanation. Whilst this approach may be effective in terms of\nB AR B AR A M AU T H E388\nincluding material such as political theory, there are particular consequences for feminist critiques\nwhere theory may not be regarded as the goal of analysis (Bottomley, 2000; Conaghan, 2000; Lacey,\n1998; Naffine, 1990; Smart, 1992). Instead, theory may be viewed as a process, something which\nfeminists can use rather than become subservient to (Nicholson (ed.), 1990). The emphasis of analysis\nis upon the discovery of context and the legitimacy of expression of personal experiences. Theory, in\nits current use within the theory and\/or values debate and public law (along with the wider remit of\nlaw in general) marginalises such material. The consequence for some feminist analysis is to search\nfor alternative methodologies (Cooper, 1998). Accordingly, there is a methodological dichotomy\nbetween public law analysis and feminist critiques, which on the face of it, appears to be irresolvable.\nVIII. Public law and the long-term development of analysis\nThe above examination raises a number of issues in respect of the long-term development of public\nlaw analysis. Given the exclusionary properties of explanation identified within the context of the\ntheory and\/or values debate and its likely, albeit untested, manifestation within wider analysis of\npublic law, the question arises, should explanation remain as the preferred method of analysis? To\nalter the basis of public law analysis fundamentally would entail searching back to the origins of the\nsubject, and possibly even strike at the very nature of legal analysis. Such a task would prove\noverwhelming, unrealistic and ultimately unfruitful, particularly if the enhancement of public\nlaw scholarship is the desired goal as opposed to the enhancement of explanation as analysis. If it\nis accepted that explanation is, and will remain, the dominant form within public law, this then\nraises a number of additional questions. How, for example, can public law analysis develop to\naccommodate alternative knowledge-based approaches? How can public law analysis move beyond\ndomination by theory? There is one answer to both these questions \u2013 through the use of concepts.\nIX. Concepts and public law analysis \u2014 concluding remarks\nWithin the context of the theory and\/or values debate, and the wider remit of public law, there does\nnot exist a specific meaning as to what is a concept although outside of public law many definitions\ncan be found (Weitz, 1988). Basically, a concept can be described as an abstract representation which\nattempts to use words to portray reality (Gallie, 1956; Thagard, 1992). Concepts and theory are tools\nfor the presentation of information, yet they differ particularly in terms of where information can be\nfound. In respect of theory, information has to be discovered even if it is thought or known that that\nthe information exits. Theories represent, at most, a consensus regarding the information relating to\na particular phenomenon and an essential part of that consensus is the process of discovery by which\nthe validity of the agreed information can be confirmed. Concepts, on the other hand, represent an\nidea about a particular phenomenon; in other words, information is predefined, it does not have to be\ndiscovered as it is already known. The particular example used elsewhere to illustrate this difference\nwas that of Rufus the siamese cat (Mauthe, 2005a). If siamese cat is a concept then there will exist\ncertain pre-defined information which will be associated with the concept of a siamese cat, such as\nthe fact that Rufus should have blue eyes. If he does not have blue eyes, then he will be something\nother than a siamese cat. However, it is also possible for siamese cat to exist as a hypothesis. If\nsiamese cat is a hypothesis, then the theory which proves that Rufus is a siamese cat will attempt to\nidentify what the features of a siamese cat are. It may be thought that siamese cats will have\nblue eyes, but it must first be established that blue eyes are a feature of siamese cats, only then can\nit be concluded that Rufus is indeed a siamese cat. The feature of blue eyes cannot be assumed, it\nmust be found.\nWithin public law analysis there is a perception that the relationship between theories and\nconcepts is hierarchical in nature. Theories are the situated at the apex of this hierarchy whilst\nPU B LI C L AW, K N OW LE D GE A N D E X P LA N AT I ON 389\nconcepts are subsidiary to and entrenched within theories. Furthermore, concepts are isolated\nrepresentations of information and it is theory which links one concept to another.18 A consequence\nof this subsidiary and isolated role is that concepts are viewed as being closed in nature and lack the\nfacilitative capacity of theory. These perceptions have, however, been successfully challenged else-\nwhere, specifically in relation to the incommensurability of theories, where it was found that\nconcepts possess a flexibility and can incorporate a breadth of analysis beyond that of theory\n(Mauthe 2005, 2005a). Instead of linking disparate concepts via a single theory, a number of disparate\nconcepts were used to link a variety of theories which, when juxtaposed, appeared to be incompa-\ntible. This was achieved by using a few loosely defined, or \u2018open textured\u2019 concepts to link to\ninformation found within the various theories. It is an approach that public lawyers do all the\ntime, but not necessarily in the context of public law. Consider, for example, the statement \u2018Rufus the\nsiamese cat is an animal\u2019. The concepts \u2018siamese cat\u2019 and \u2018animal\u2019 will be known and is it unnecessary\nto explain them yet it is also accepted that there is a link between the two sets of information\n(Jackson, 1998). In other words, the disparate sets of information represented by the concepts siamese\ncat and animals can be linked without the use of theory whilst each of the concepts will contain\ntheory, a theory of siamese cats and a theory of animals. Of course, transferring conceptual analysis\nfrom this somewhat simplistic example to the wider remit of public law analysis will require some\nrigour. Given the success of this use of concepts in complex areas of public law analysis, such as\nsovereignty (Mauthe, 2005a) and the central-local government relationship (Mauthe, 2005), this\nwould indicate that concepts can be used as explanatory mechanisms in their own right and the task\nmay not prove to be impossible.\nThere are also a number of positive outcomes to be found in respect of using concepts as the basis\nfor analysis. There would, for example, be a widening the range of analytical tools available to public\nlawyers beyond that of theory. Concepts could also be used to traverse the gap between explanation\nand knowledge thereby facilitating the inclusion of knowledge-based analysis, such as feminist\ncritiques. The approach possesses merit, especially as there are areas of public law analysis where\nconcepts have been used to resolve analytical difficulties (Mauthe, 2005). Alternatively, concepts\ncould be said to lack the authority of theory, except that authority, particularly when it is premised\nupon the capacity to resist dislodgement, is only one facet as to what should constitute \u2018good\u2019\nanalysis (Kuhn, 1996). Additionally, there is always the risk that strength does not represent reality\n(Mauthe 1999, 2000). Indeed, if concepts can facilitate the inclusion of alternative and new critiques\nwithin public law analysis then surely that represents a form of strength. The question is then, which\nconcepts are to be used. The answer to this question represents another paper.\nReferences\nAYER, Alfred (1956) The Problem of Knowledge.
