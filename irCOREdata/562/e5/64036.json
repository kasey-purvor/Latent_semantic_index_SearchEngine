Away from coastal regions influenced by freshwater \nsources, the vertical physical structure of the water column is driven primarily by the \ncompeting effects of vertical mixing, predominantly tidally-driven in NW European \nshelf seas, and seasonally-varying solar heating (Simpson and Bowers, 1984). Deep \nregions, and\/or regions with low tidal currents (such as the northern North Sea, the \nwestern English Channel, and the Celtic Sea) thermally stratify in spring and summer \nas the influence of solar irradiance overcomes the capacity for the tidal mixing to \nmaintain a vertically homogeneous water column. Shallower areas or areas with \nstrong tidal currents (e.g. the Irish Sea, southern North Sea, and the central English \nChannel) remain vertically-mixed all year as the strength of the tidal turbulence is \nalways able to overcome the stratifying effect of the solar heating. The mixing and \nstratifying influences balance at the shelf sea tidal mixing fronts, the position of which \ncan be described by the ratio of the total water depth to the cube of a measure of the \ntidal current strength (e.g. Simpson and Hunter, 1974; Simpson, 1981). The success of \nthis approach in correctly predicting the frontal positions underlines the dominance of \nvertical exchange processes and the weak impacts of advection in these shelf seas, \nallowing many questions to be addressed in a 1-dimensional (vertical) framework. \n \n This physical partitioning into seasonally-stratified, permanently-mixed, and \nfrontal regimes is pivotal in determining the environment for primary production \n(Sharples and Holligan, 2006). In stratifying regions the development of a thermocline \nin spring alleviates the light-limited conditions experienced by the phytoplankton, \nleading to the rapid growth of the spring bloom in the new surface layer, followed by \nmaintenance of new primary production within the thermocline during the summer \n(e.g. Pingree et al., 1976). The spring bloom is a critical event, being the first \nsignificant supply of organic fuel to the rest of the marine ecosystem following the \nwinter. The timing of the bloom is known to play an important role for the growth and \nsurvival of other components of the marine ecosystem, e.g. copepods (Head et al., \n2000), fish larvae (Platt et al., 2003), and seabirds (Frederiksen et al., 2006). Sub-\nsurface growth of phytoplankton during the summer, while having typically lower \nbiomass concentrations than the spring bloom, often has high f-ratios (Probyn et al., \n1995) and is an important source of organic carbon to the ecosystem, thought to be \ncomparable to the spring bloom in terms of its contribution to the total annual primary \nproduction in stratifying shelf seas (Richardson et al., 2000; Weston et al., 2005). \nShelf sea fronts have long been associated with enhanced levels of phytoplankton \nbiomass (Pingree et al., 1975; Tett et al., 1993) resulting from locally increased \nprimary production (Horne et al., 1996; Maguer et al., 2000). Primary productivity at \nthese fronts is also associated, probably causally, with increased densities of \nzooplankton, fish larvae, and foraging predators (e.g. Durazo et al., 1998; Sims and \nQuayle, 1998; Russell et al., 1999; Lough and Manning, 2001). \n \n Against the background of the seasonality of meteorological forcing \ncompeting with some average measure of tidal mixing, investigations into the impacts \nof variability in mixing inputs on shelf sea primary production have primarily \nconcentrated on the effects of variable wind stress.  Variability in winds during spring \nis an important source of inter-annual variability in the timing of the spring bloom in \nshelf seas (Eslinger and Iverson, 2001; Sharples et al., 2006) and in the open ocean \n(Waniek, 2003), with impacts on the rest of the marine ecosystem. During the summer \nSharples\/Spring-neap cycle and primary production 3\nstratified period short-term wind events are important in determining the physical \nstructure of the surface layer and thermocline (Ridderinkhof, 1992), with episodic \npulses of wind deepening the thermocline and either fuelling primary production in \nthe sub-surface biomass maximum (Sharples and Tett, 1994) or entraining nutrients \ninto the surface layer (Yin et al., 1995). Incorporating sufficient knowledge of surface \nwind variability is vital for correct simulations of ecosystem structure and annual \nprimary production rates (Ruardij et al., 1997). \n \nOther than the horizontal variations in mean tidal mixing that underlie the \nbroad partitioning of shelf seas, very little emphasis has been placed on the impacts of \ntidally-driven variability on shelf sea primary production. In NW European shelf seas \nspring tidal currents are typically twice those during neap tides, implying a difference \nof a factor of 8 in the available mixing energy. Spring-neap tidal variability has been \nshown to play a role in the timing of the spring bloom, possibly by briefly interrupting \nthe development of spring stratification (Sharples et al., 2006). Phytoplankton growth \nand ecosystem responses to the spring-neap cycle have been predicted with numerical \nmodels of the seasonal thermocline (Sharples, 1999; Allen et al., 2004) as a result of \nperiodic erosion of the base of the summer thermocline by an approaching spring tide, \nfollowed by deepening stratification approaching the next neap tide. Direct \nobservations of phytoplankton carbon flux from the thermocline into the bottom \nmixed layer have been suggested to be driven by the spring-neap mixing cycle \n(Sharples et al., 2001). There is a well-understood spring-neap adjustment in the \nposition of shelf sea fronts (Simpson and Bowers, 1979) which is thought to provide a \nmechanism for supplying nutrients to frontal phytoplankton (Loder and Platt, 1985; \nRogachev et al., 2001). There may be spring-neap contrasts in the generation of \ninternal waves and the associated vertical fluxes of nitrogen to the photic zone at the \nshelf edge (Holligan et al., 1985; Sharples et al., 2007), while in coastal waters there \nis data to suggest that red tides tend to occur during the stronger stratification at neap \ntides (Balch, 1986). \n \nThis paper uses a numerical model to provide a first assessment of the broader \nimplications of the spring-neap tidal cycle for annual production rates and vertical \ncarbon fluxes in shelf seas, quantifying the potential contribution that the spring-neap \ntidal cycle may make to inter-annual variability in spring bloom timing and to primary \nproduction and carbon fluxes in the vicinity of shelf sea fronts.  \n \nMethod \n Identifying spring-neap impacts on shelf sea primary production is inherently \ndifficult observationally. While technically feasible, sufficiently long time series of \nvertical profiles of chlorophyll do not yet exist simply because of the cost of the \nrequired instrumentation. Time series of profiles of biological rates and vertical \nturbulent fluxes of nutrients are even more problematic, as existing methods rely on \nintensive ship-based experiments. Instead oceanographers are reliant on numerical \nmodels to fill in the gaps between often patchy observations, and to provide the \nobservations with a broader context.  \n \nThe approach here is to use a 1-dimensional (vertical) coupled physics-\nprimary production numerical model to simulate annual cycles of stratification and \nphytoplankton growth for a typical NW European shelf sea, and to use the model \noutput to construct vertical-horizontal slices of physical and biological properties \nSharples\/Spring-neap cycle and primary production 4\nacross a shelf sea tidal mixing front. The cross-frontal simulations follow an \nestablished method of synthesising a vertical slice through a shelf sea front by \ncombining a series of 1-dimensional vertical profiles generated with different tidal \ncurrent speeds and\/or water column depth (Simpson and Sharples, 1994).  \n \nThe physical model is identical to that used by Sharples et al., 2006, \nsimulating the annual cycle of vertical temperature profiles in response to tidal mixing \nand seasonally-varying meteorology. The link between the efficiency of vertical \nturbulent mixing and the inhibiting effect of stratification is provided by a k \u03b5\u2212  \nturbulence closure scheme (Canuto et al., 2001), with modified constants as described \nby Holt and Umlauf (in press). This closure scheme has been shown to be equivalent \nto the often-used Mellor-Yamada scheme (Burchard et al., 1998).  Collecting the \nnecessary observations in shelf seas suitable for verification of model turbulent \nparameters is in practice still very difficult. The schemes compare well with \nobservations of boundary-driven turbulent dissipation in stratifying and mixed shelf \nseas (Simpson et al., 1996). Methodological limitations have so far prevented \ncomparison with observations of turbulent kinetic energy, but the models have been \nwell verified in laboratory flows (e.g. Patel et al., 1985). The applicability of these \nturbulence schemes for shelf sea modelling is underlined by the correct simulation of \nthe timing of spring stratification and the inter-annual drift in the climate of the North \nSea (Sharples et al., 2006), and the positions of the shelf sea tidal mixing fronts using \nboth 1-D (Simpson and Sharples, 1994) and fully 3-D (Holt and Umlauf, in press) \napproaches.  \n \n The physical model is forced by smoothly-varying seasonal meteorology, and \ntidal conditions similar to the Celtic Sea. Seasonally-varying surface noon irradiance \n( noonI , W m\n-2) is calculated as the noon clear-sky irradiance for latitude 50\u00b0, modified \nby a smoothly varying (sinusoidal) cloudiness ranging from a winter value of 80% at \nthe start and end of the year and a summer value of 50% in the middle of the year: \n \n( ) ( )369 247 cos 29sinnoon a JD a JDI t t\u03c9 \u03c9= \u2212 +    (1) \n \nwith a\u03c9 =0.017 d-1 the annual frequency and JDt the time (days) expressed as the \nJulian Day ( JDt = 1 day on January 1st). Surface irradiance has a diurnal cycle, using a \nsinusoidal variation with amplitude noonI  and the length of daylight varying seasonally \nfor latitude 50\u00b0. Seasonally-varying daily means of wind speed ( w , m s-1), air \ntemperature ( airT , \u00b0C), air pressure ( airP , mbar), and relative humidity ( RH , %) are \nprovided by sinusoidal functions fitted to ERA-40 re-analysis of the output from the \nEuropean Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) numerical \nmodel for a position in the middle of the Celtic Sea in the year 1999: \n \n( ) ( )12.05 3.39cos 2.39sinair a JD a JDT t t\u03c9 \u03c9= \u2212 \u2212    (2) \n( ) ( )( )1265.5 31.5cos 2.5sina JD a JDw t t\u03c9 \u03c9= + +    (3) \n( ) ( )(1.0140 0.0004cos 0.0009sin 1000air a JD a JDP t t\u03c9 \u03c9= \u2212 + \u00d7   (4) \n( ) ( )83.4 1.9cos 0.03sina JD a JDRH t t\u03c9 \u03c9= \u2212 \u2212    (5) \n \nSharples\/Spring-neap cycle and primary production 5\nNote that equation (3) is based on a fit to the square of the ERA-40 wind speed, to \nbetter describe the annual cycle of wind stress. The seasonality of the air-sea heat flux \nin a temperate shelf sea is primarily driven by the changing surface irradiance (Eqn. \n(1)) and the gradient between the sea surface temperature and the air temperature (Fig. \n1A). There is some seasonality in the surface winds (Fig. 1B) captured by the fit to the \nseasonal function. A large amount of short-term wind variability is smoothed out by \nequation (3); while this variability is normally an important component of accurate \nsimulations of shelf sea primary production, not including it here allows clear \nidentification of spring-neap driven variability. Variability in relative humidity (Fig. \n1C) and air pressure (Fig. 1D) is almost entirely associated with short-term weather \nevents with very little seasonal signal. This dominance of surface irradiance and air \ntemperature is consistent with analysis of observed positions of shelf sea fronts, with \nwind variability found to play a secondary role (e.g. Simpson, 1981). Smoothing out \nthe meteorological events does remove an important source of environmental \nvariability that is key to the maintenance of sub-surface phytoplankton growth in the \nthermocline in summer, primarily by episodic pulses of nutrients mixed upward from \nthe bottom mixed layer (Sharples and Tett, 1994). To account for this variability a \nbackground turbulent diffusivity of 1 x 10-5 m2 s-1 is included here, previously shown \nby Sharples and Tett, 1994, to represent adequately the mean effect of wind events in \ndriving mixing at the thermocline. \n \n \nFigure 1. \nTime series of the daily-mean meteorological data, (A) air temperature, (B) wind speed, (C) relative \nhumidity, and (D) air pressure. The dots are data from the ERA-40 re-analysis, for a position in the \ncentral Celtic Sea and the year 1999. The lines are fits to a seasonal sinusoidal function (see equations \n(2) \u2013 (5)), showing most of the seasonality in the air temperature and wind speed, and smoothing out \nany short term weather influences. \n \n \n In order to address the question of how spring-neap variations in tidal mixing \nmight impact primary production the essential requirement is for a modelled primary \nproducer that responds on realistic timescales to changes in the light and nutrient \nenvironment. A relatively simple model is used here, similar to that of Sharples and \nTett, 1994. The biological model calculates the development of a single group of \nphytoplankton in response to light and dissolved inorganic nitrate, with the nitrate \nresponse incorporated using a cell-quota approach (Droop, 1974). Phytoplankton are \nSharples\/Spring-neap cycle and primary production 6\nmodelled in terms of carbon, CP  (mg m\n-3), and internal cellular nitrogen, NP  (mmol \nm-3), with the cell nitrogen quota N CQ P P= (mmol N (mg C)-1).  These biological \nstate variables are treated in an Eulerian frame, diffusing vertically in response to the \nmodelled turbulent diffusivity. Clearly it is an approximation; real phytoplankton cells \nand their constituents follow Lagrangian paths under the influence of turbulence, and \nideally a Lagrangian model (e.g. Ross and Sharples, 2004) would be used. However, \nthe computational demands of a Lagrangian approach make many problems, including \nthe problem addressed by this paper, impractical. The Eulerian approximation is \ncomputationally much faster, and has been shown to result in prediction of primary \nproduction rates negligibly different (errors <3%) from the Lagrangian method \n(McGillicuddy, 1995). The disadvantage of the Eulerian approach is that some \nphenomena (e.g. physiologically-determined phytoplankton motility, Ross & \nSharples, 2007) cannot be addressed; in this paper the results are restricted to those \naspects of the ecosystem that are amenable to an Eulerian approach. \n \nPhytoplankton carbon is modelled as: \n \nC C\nz C C\nP PK P GP\nt z z\n\u03bc\u2202 \u2202\u2202 \u239b \u239e= + \u2212\u239c \u239f\u2202 \u2202 \u2202\u239d \u23a0     (6) \n \nwhere t  (s) is time and z (m) is the vertical (positive upward) co-ordinate. The first \nterm on the right of equation (6) describes vertical mixing by the turbulent eddy \ndiffusivity, zK  (m\n2 s-1), supplied by the physics model. The second term changes \nphytoplankton carbon in response to growth rate \u03bc  (s-1). The maximum growth rate, \nm\u03bc (s-1), is related to the temperature (following Eppley, 1972), modified by the cell \nnitrogen quota, by: \n \n5 0.06331.16 10 0.59 Tsubm\nm sub\nQ Q e\nQ Q\n\u03bc \u2212 \u239b \u239e\u2212= \u00d7 \u239c \u239f\u2212\u239d \u23a0     (7) \n \nwith subQ the subsistence cell quota and mQ  the maximum cell quota. The \nphytoplankton growth rate is then determined by the photosynthetically available \nradiation (PAR, PARI , W m\n-2) and accounting for respirative losses by \n1\nPAR\nm\nI\nB\nm e r\n\u03b1 \u03b8\n\u03bc\u03bc \u03bc\n\u239b \u239e\u2212\u239c \u239f\u239d \u23a0\n\u239b \u239e\u239c \u239f= \u2212 \u2212\u239c \u239f\u239d \u23a0\n     (8) \n \n(e.g. Geider et al., 1998) where \u03b1  (mg C (mg Chl)-1 (W m-2)-1 s-1) is the maximum \nlight utilisation coefficient and \u03b8  (mg Chl (mg C)-1) is a fixed phytoplankton \nChlorophyll:carbon. The constant Br  (s-1) represents cell respiration. Photoinhibition \nof the growth rate at high irradiances has not been included. Such impacts are \ngenerally seen in samples incubated at constant, high light; at the thermocline and in \nmixing layers photoinhibition is unlikely to be a significant factor. Surface incident \nPAR is taken to be a fixed 45% of the solar irradiance. PAR decays exponentially \naway from the sea surface following \n \nSharples\/Spring-neap cycle and primary production 7\n( )IPAR I k PPAR PAR Cz \u03b5\u03b8\u2202 = \u2212 +\u2202     (9) \n \nwith PARk  (m\n-1) the attenuation coefficient for PAR and \u03b5  (m2 (mg Chl)-1) the \nChlorophyll specific light extinction coefficient. The attenuation PARk  can vary \nsubstantially through the year (higher during mixed conditions, lower in the surface \nstratified layer) and spatially (higher on the mixed side of a shelf sea front). This is \nincorporated by setting PARk =0.12 m\n-1 when the water column is mixed (determined \nby a surface-bottom temperature difference of less than 0.25 \u00b0C), and reducing to \nPARk =0.09 m\n-1 when the water is stratified. These values of PARk  follow typical \nobservations in the Celtic and Irish Seas (Bowers and Mitchelson-Jacob, 1996; \nSharples et al., 2001). The final term on the right of equation (6) is a loss of \nphytoplankton to grazing. The grazing impact rate G (s-1) is taken as a constant \nthroughout the year, set at a typical annual mean based on the observations of (Lee et \nal., 2002). At this stage it is noted that a number of important simplifications have \nbeen incorporated in the biological model, in particular a fixed (rather than \ntemperature-dependent) respiration rate, a fixed Chl:C ratio, and a fixed grazing \nimpact. While adding further biological processes may better reflect our \nunderstanding of the primary producers, they also require additional driving \nparameters that are generally poorly constrained by observational data. Justification of \nthe validity of these simplifications in the context of the results of this work is \nincluded in the discussion. \n \nSimilar to equation (6), phytoplankton cellular nitrogen is modelled as: \n \nN N\nz C N\nP PK uP GP\nt z z\n\u2202 \u2202\u2202 \u239b \u239e= + \u2212\u239c \u239f\u2202 \u2202 \u2202\u239d \u23a0     (10) \n \nThe second term on the right of equation (10) is the uptake of nitrogen, with the \nuptake rate a Michaelis-Menton function of the external dissolved inorganic nitrogen \nconcentration DIN (mmol m-3), and the half saturation constant, uk (mmol m\n-3): \n \n( )m\n: 0\n1\n0 : 0m u\nQQ Su u\nQ k S\n\u03bc \u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u23a1 \u23a4 <\u239b \u239e= \u2212 +\u23a2 \u23a5\u239c \u239f \u2265+\u239d \u23a0\u23a3 \u23a6\n   (11) \n \nwith mu (mmol DIN (mg C)\n-1 s-1) the maximum biomass-specific uptake rate.

This was investigated by identifying the time of the onset of the spring bloom \n(identified as the time when surface phytoplankton biomass exceeds a value of 10 mg \nC m-3) as a function of the phase lag of the S2 tidal currents relative to M2 at midnight \non January 1st. Two examples are shown, one analogous to the central Celtic Sea with \nweak tidal currents (M2 amplitude of 0.2 m s-1; Fig. 2A), and one for stronger tidal \ncurrents closer to a shelf sea front (M2 amplitude of 0.5 m s-1; Fig. 2B). In both cases \nthere is a clear fortnightly signal in the bloom onset as a function of phase lag. The \ngradually delayed spring tide currents initially force a similarly delayed the start of the \nbloom. The bloom timing then switches earlier as the preceding neap tide currents \nbegin to allow stratification under weaker irradiance. For the case of weak tidal \ncurrents (Fig. 2A) the total range of the effect is 3 days. In the case of stronger tidal \ncurrents (Fig. 2B) the largest difference between the timings of established blooms is \nabout 8 days. However, with the stronger tidal currents there is also the possibility of \nthe initial stages of the bloom being eroded at spring tides (e.g. between phases of 1.4 \nand 3.2 radians, Fig. 2B) and leading to a late onset of the established bloom.  \n \n \nFigure 2. \nSpring and early summer surface biomass (line contours, mg C m-3) and daily-averaged depth-mean \ncurrents (shaded) as a function of the January 1st phase (or time) difference between the M2 and S2 tidal \nconstituents, for (A) a water depth of 80 m and M2 tidal current amplitude of 0.2 m s-1, and (B) a water \ndepth of 80 m and M2 tidal current amplitude of 0.5 m s-1.  Corresponding changes in the integrated \ncarbon fixation from the start of the year to the peak of the spring bloom are shown in (C) and (D) for \nthe M2 amplitudes of 0.2 and 0.5 m s-1 respectively. The shaded contouring illustrates neap tides \n(white) and spring tides (dark), contoured with a 0.05 m s-1 interval. Neap daily-averaged tidal currents \nare 0.09 m s-1 in (A) and 0.27 m s-1 in (B). The second x-axes below (C) and (D) allows interpretation \nof the phase difference in terms of the date of the first January spring tide. \nSharples\/Spring-neap cycle and primary production 10\nThe model also predicts a spring-neap effect on the total carbon fixed during \nthe spring bloom. Integrating the gross carbon fixation up to the peak of the spring \nbloom in the low tidal current regime (Fig. 2C) shows there is a range of variability of \nalmost 2 g C m-2, about 14% of the mean. For the stronger tidal regime (Fig. 2D) this \npotential for inter-annual variability is less, with a total range of 4% compared to the \nmean. \n \nSpring-neap signals at a shelf sea front. \n Cross-frontal sections of temperature and phytoplankton biomass were \nsimulated by combining, at each day through the year, model results from a series of \nruns with depth fixed at 80 metres and M2 tidal current amplitude allowed to vary \nfrom 0.2 to 1.5 m s-1 (e.g. Sharples and Simpson, 1996). The horizontal, cross-front \ndimension is quantified in terms of the stratification parameter ( )310log h U (Simpson \nand Hunter, 1974), with h (metres) the water depth and 3U  (m3 s-3) the long-term \naverage of the cubed depth-mean current speed. Resolution across the front in all the \nresults is typically 0.04 units of ( )310log h U . Typical gradients of ( )310log h U  in the \nvicinity of fronts in NW European shelf seas vary between 0.02 and 0.06 log10(m-2 s3) \nkm-1 (Pingree and Griffiths, 1978). Spring-neap adjustment of fronts\u2019 positions has \nbeen observed to be 4 km (Simpson and Bowers, 1981), averaged over observed \nfronts in the Celtic and Irish Seas. \n \n Cross-frontal sections for the case with the M2 tide only (Fig. 3A) and for neap \nand spring tides when M2 and S2 operate together (Fig. 3B, C) show typical features \nof tidal mixing fronts. Isotherms of the thermocline reach upward to form a sharp \nsurface front, and downward to form a weaker bottom front. The position of the edge \nof the front (determined by a surface-bottom temperature difference of 1\u00b0C) occurs at ( )310log h U = 2.75 \u2013 2.8 for the spring tide and M2 fronts respectively, and \n( )310log h U = 2.4 for the neap tide front. Observed frontal positions tend to average \nat about ( )310log h U = 2.7 (Holt and Umlauf, in press). All three fronts in Fig. 3 show \nenhanced phytoplankton biomass within the front at the surface, and decreasing \nconcentrations within the thermocline on the stratified side of the front. With the 1-D \nframework used to generate the fronts, this indicates that increased frontal surface \nbiomass can be driven by the weaker stratification providing a flux of nutrients to the \nsurface, at the same time as maintaining sufficient near-surface stability for the \nphytoplankton to be able to photosynthesise (Loder and Platt, 1985). There is a \nmarked difference between the spring tide (Fig. 3B) and neap tide (Fig. 3C) fronts. At \nneap tide stratification extends into lower ( )310log h U , with a broader frontal \nsignature in phytoplankton biomass and higher concentrations of biomass (maximum \nsurface concentrations of 240 mg C m-3 at neap tide compared to 190 mg C m-3 at \nspring tide). \n \nThe repeatability of this apparent neap-spring physical adjustment of frontal \nposition and the corresponding contrasts in frontal biomass can be seen by \nconsidering the seasonal behaviour of stratification and surface biomass (Fig. 4). The \namplitude of the spring-neap frontal excursion ranges between 0.2 and 0.35 ( )310log h U , suggesting horizontal excursions of between 3 and 17 km based on the \nSharples\/Spring-neap cycle and primary production 11\ntypical gradients of ( )310log h U  and a mean over the stratified period of about 4 \u2013 13 \nkm. \n \n \nFigure 3. \nCross-frontal slices of temperature (lines) and phytoplankton carbon (colours) for (A) the model with \nM2 tides only on Julian day 182, (B) the model with a spring-neap cycle for Julian day 182 (spring \ntides), and (C) the model with a spring-neap cycle for Julian day 189 (neap tides). \n \nThis ranges higher than the mean adjustment of 4 km reported by Simpson and \nBowers, 1981, probably because the 1-dimensional method does not allow dynamic \nadjustment of the density gradients at the front which would limit the extent of neap \nre-stratification. The timing and contrasts in vertical structure are, however, correctly \nre-produced. For the case with the M2 tide only (Fig. 4A) there is a smooth transition \nfrom the spring bloom to an established frontal biomass that gradually decays after \nmid summer. Indeed, Fig. 4A suggests that one interpretation of the existence of \nfrontal primary productivity is that the weak frontal stratification effectively maintains \na localised spring bloom-like environment through the summer. For the case with a \nspring-neap tidal cycle (Fig. 4B) there is a band approximately between 2.4 \n< ( )310log h U < 2.8 that undergoes a fortnightly series of biomass pulses between the \nend of May and the end of August. The dynamics underlying this spring-neap pulsing \nof surface biomass are similar to those at the spring bloom. Stratification begins as the \ntidal currents reduce towards neap tides, allowing the surface heat flux to overcome \nthe available mixing, and is then rapidly eroded as the tidal currents increase again \ntowards spring tides (Fig. 5A). Peak stratification occurs about 3 days after neap tides. \nThe phytoplankton biomass at the surface rises with the developing stratification \nreaching it maximum also about 3 days after neaps (Fig. 5B). At the same time the \nsurface nitrate, previously replenished by the strong vertical mixing at spring tides, is \nreduced though not completely depleted (Fig. 5B). \nSharples\/Spring-neap cycle and primary production 12\n \n \nFigure 4. \nVariations of cross-front surface phytoplankton carbon (colours) and surface-bottom temperature \ndifference (lines) from early spring to late autumn for (A) the model with M2 tides only, and (B) the \nmodel with a spring-neap cycle. \n \nThe absolute uptake of the surface nitrate is locked to the increase in biomass, while \nthe biomass-specific uptake of nitrate has a broader distribution lagging the neap tide \nby about 2 days (Fig. 5C). The absolute rate of surface carbon fixation peaks at 0.07 g \nC m-3 d-1 1 day after the peak biomass, compared to a minimum of 0.02 g C m-3 d-1 \nover the previous spring tide. The biomass-specific carbon fixation reduces slightly as \nthe stratification develops and has a sharp peak just as the stratification is eroded (Fig. \n5D). This peak is due to the addition of biomass with high nitrate quota from below \nthe transient surface layer briefly growing efficiently in the decaying stratification. \nThe small reduction in the efficiency of carbon fixation indicates growth exceeding \nthe capacity for nitrate uptake, leading to a reduction in the cellular nitrate quota. \nOverall, the small delay in the timing of stratification, peak nitrate uptake, and peak \nbiomass, indicates that the rate of stratification is governing the capacity of the \nbiological components to respond to the environment. \n \nFigure 5. \nTime series over one spring neap cycle of (A) surface-bottom temperature difference (solid line) and \ndaily-averaged depth-mean current speed (dashed line), (B) surface phytoplankton (solid line) and \nsurface DIN (dashed line), (C) absolute surface nitrate uptake rate (solid line) and biomass-specific \nsurface nitrate uptake (dashed line), and (D) absolute rate of surface carbon fixation (solid line) and \nbiomass-specific surface growth rate (dashed line). In each panel the solid line uses the left axis, and \nthe dashed line uses the right axis. \nSharples\/Spring-neap cycle and primary production 13\nSpring-neap signals in the summer thermocline. \n Below the sea surface the spring-neap cycle in bottom boundary layer \nturbulence has clear impacts on the thermocline layer of phytoplankton. The base of \nthe thermocline is periodically eroded as the tidal turbulence increases towards spring \ntides. As neap tides approach the strength of turbulence high in the water column \ndecreases, allowing the thermocline to develop deeper in the water column (Fig. 6A). \nThe total vertical excursion of this thermocline movement is about 3 m. The highest \nposition of the thermocline base occurs at the same time as spring tides, while the \ndeepest position occurs about 2 days after neap tides. The biological response has a \nclear sequence. The region of peak nitrate uptake tracks the base of the thermocline, \nwith maximum values tending to occur approaching and during spring tides (Fig. 6B), \na consequence of both increased mixing and a sharpening of the nitracline. Maximum \nbiomass-specific carbon fixation rates, reaching 0.40 d-1 (compared to a neap tide \nminimum of 0.32 d-1) occur at spring tides (Fig. 6C). This is partially due to the \nsupply of nitrate (increasing the cell nitrogen quota) but also because of the increased \nlight available for photosynthesis in the shallower thermocline base. Pulses in \nthermocline biomass occur at or just after neap tides (Fig. 6D), typically reaching 140 \ng C m-3, compared to spring tide minima of about 100 mg C m-3. The flux of this \norganic carbon out of the thermocline peaks at 200 mg C m-2 d-1 at the midpoint \nbetween neap and spring tides (Fig. 6E), with a broader minimum flux of 25 - 50 mg \nC m-2 d-1 around neap tides. By contrast, at the same time of year the mean carbon \nflux with just the M2 tide is about 100 mg C m-2 d-1. \n \n \nFigure 6. \nSpring-neap variability in the thermocline. The physical variability is shown as changes in the \ntemperature structure (line contours, \u00b0C) and vertical eddy diffusivity (shaded) in (A), with spring tides \noccurring on Julian day 195, neaps tides on Julian days 187 and 202. The corresponding biological \nsignals are (B) nitrate uptake rate (mmol DIN (mg C)-1 d-1), (C) specific growth rate (d-1), (D) \nphytoplankton biomass (mg C m-3), and (D) vertical carbon flux (mg C m-2 d-1). \nSharples\/Spring-neap cycle and primary production 14\nDiscussion and Conclusions \n The results indicate clear impacts of the spring-neap cycle on a range of \naspects of primary production in thermally-stratifying shelf seas. The following \ndiscussion will place the results in the context of other causes of variability, and \nquantify the consequences of the modelled variability in terms of potential impacts on \nestimating annual production and carbon export in shelf seas. Throughout it is \nadvisable to be wary of over-interpreting absolute values of, for instance, total annual \nproduction or annual carbon export because of the simplicity of the modelled \necosystem. However, given the difficulty in obtaining sufficiently long and well-\nresolved time series of phytoplankton production sufficient to address the impacts of \nboth meteorological and tidal variability, this modelling approach provides a viable \nmeans of making a first estimate of the proportionate impact of the spring-neap cycle \non primary production, and provides a basis for placing typically \u201csnapshot\u201d \nobservations of production rates into a longer-term context. This discussion begins \nwith some demonstrations that the absolute predictions made by the model do \ncompare favourably with typical observations, providing some level of support for the \nuse of such a simple biological model. Most of the interpretation that then follows \nmakes comparisons between the model using M2 tides only and using a realistic \nspring-neap cycle. Estimates of the likely impacts of key biological simplifications are \nalso provided. \n \nComparison between the modelled production rates and fluxes, and typical \nobservations, provides support for the coupled 1-dimensional framework. The total \nannual production predicted by the model for a site analogous to the central, \nseasonally stratifying Celtic Sea is about 70 g C m-2; the observed annual rate of \nprimary production has been reported as 80 g C m-2 (Joint and Groom, 2000). The \nsuccess of this model result reflects the dominant role of the initial winter nitrate \nconcentration in fuelling the spring bloom and in setting the limits of the vertical \nnitrate gradient at the base of the thermocline in summer. The vertical turbulent flux \nof nitrate into the summer thermocline predicted by the model was typically 2 \u2013 3  \nmmol NO3 m-2 d-1 during the transition between neap and spring tides, compared to \ndirect measurements of 2 \u00b1 1 mmol NO3 m-2 d-1 (Sharples et al., 2001). This \ncomparison in particular reflects the model\u2019s skill in simulating the turbulent \ndiffusivity at the base of the thermocline, along with setting the strength of the vertical \nnitrate gradient (a function of both the thermocline turbulence and the phytoplankton \nnitrate uptake).  \n \n The timing of the spring bloom was shown to vary in response to the timing of \nspring tides during the increasing surface irradiance that drives stratification (Fig. 2). \nIn the case of weak tidal currents (M2 amplitude of 0.2 m s-1) the model predicts that \nthis could lead to inter-annual variability in the timing of the spring bloom of up to 3 \ndays (Fig. 2A). With real meteorological forcing the spring bloom in the northern \nNorth Sea has been predicted to vary over a window of about 1 month, with a \nstandard deviation of 6 days (Sharples et al., 2006), and so the spring-neap cycle \ncontributes only about 10% of the total variability with the rest dominated by the \nmeteorology. However, in a more transitional environment where stronger tidal \ncurrents lead to a later onset of thermal stratification (M2 amplitude of 0.5 m s-1; Fig. \n2B), the range of the possible spring-neap changes to the start of the bloom was \npredicted to be 8 days. For the northern North Sea this could account for almost 25% \nof the total inter-annual variability. With the timing of the bloom being an important \nSharples\/Spring-neap cycle and primary production 15\ndeterminant of the survival of other components of the marine ecosystem (e.g. Head et \nal., 2000; Platt et al., 2003; Frederiksen et al., 2006), an assessment of variability \nsolely in response to meteorological forcing will not be sufficient. \n \nThere were small changes in the total primary production achieved by the \nspring bloom as a function of the spring-neap cycle (Fig. 2C, D). In this simple \nbiological model the production of the spring bloom is primarily set by the nitrate \navailable in the surface layer as stratification first develops. However, variations in \nbloom production do occur in response to the rate at which the stratification develops. \nIn the low tidal regime the minimum bloom production occurs when the bloom is \ntriggered late. This is not the result of a shorter growth period; the integration for the \nbloom productivity is taken to the peak of the spring bloom, rather than a fixed date. \nFor the delayed bloom the slightly faster rate of increase in the strength of the \nstratification, due to the higher surface irradiance, is more efficient at shutting off the \nsupply of nitrogen from the bottom layer and so limiting the total nitrate supply to the \nsurface layer phytoplankton, a plausible mechanism for affecting bloom productivity \nand worthy of further consideration. In the case of higher tidal currents most of the \nchange in bloom production is associated with the early bloom onset and the \ntemporary erosion of the initial stages of the spring bloom by spring tides.  \n \nThe frontal biomass for the M2 case, and within the corresponding region of \nsustained stratification for the spring-neap case, was very similar (Fig. 4). The \nimportant result for the spring-neap front is the additional region of periodic \nstratification in response to the cyclic tidal mixing, leading to marked fortnightly \npulses of surface phytoplankton biomass dynamically similar to the processes that \ndrive the main spring bloom. Primary production rates within the surface waters \naffected by this spring-neap adjustment varied between 0.02 and 0.07 g C m-3 d-1, with \nthe resulting excursion region surface biomass varying typically between 70 and 250 \nmg C m-3. This frontal production is fuelled by nitrate mixed towards the surface at \nspring tides. The model predicts surface nitrate to vary from <0.5 mmol m-3 at neap \ntides to between 1 and 3 mmol m-3 at springs, suggesting a mean nitrate flux to the \nsurface 10 m of between 0.7 \u2013 3.6 mmol m-2 d-1 over the 7 days between neap and \nspring tides. This agrees with an estimate made by Loder and Platt, 1985; taking the \nmodelled adjustment region to be 4 \u2013 13 km, then their estimate of 0.12 mmol m-1 s-1 \nsuggests a vertical flux within the adjustment region of 0.8 \u2013 2.5 mmol m-2 d-1. \nPossible observational evidence for fortnightly pulsing of phytoplankton biomass is \nlimited. Weekly surveys of the front in the western Irish Sea (Richardson et al., 1985) \nhave showed frontal surface chlorophyll in early summer ranging between <2 to >4 \nmg m-3 consistent with spring-neap variability. The model predicts a range of about 3 \n\u2013 10 mg Chl m-3; the relative change in biomass is the same as the observations, \nthough the discrepancy in the absolute values could arise from the value used for the \nconstant C:Chl in the model.  A fortnightly signal in phytoplankton concentrations at \na front has also been reported over the Kashevarov Bank in the Sea of Okhotsk \n(Rogachev et al., 2001). The factor of 10 difference between the spring and neap tide \ncurrents over the Bank means that a direct comparison of changes in phytoplankton \nbiomass with the model is unlikely to be reliable. However, a speculation of \nRogachev et al., 2001, is that the dominance of a particular species of copepod over \nthe Bank may arise because the timing of its life history is ideal for exploiting the \nregular fortnightly pulses in phytoplankton biomass. The present model does not \ninclude the possibility of such \u201cbiological resonance\u201d in the grazers, and it remains an \nSharples\/Spring-neap cycle and primary production 16\nintriguing possibility for shelf sea fronts that vary with fixed, tidally-driven cycles in \nstability and primary production. \n \nThe 1-dimensional model accounts for the increasing vertical exchange \napproaching a front, and the role of spring-neap modulation of vertical mixing in \nadjusting the front\u2019s position. However, it cannot account for eddy exchange across \nthe front or the weak cross-frontal friction-driven exchange driven by the residual \nflows. Loder and Platt, 1985, estimated that local vertical exchange and spring-neap \nadjustment could account for 80% of the nitrate demands at the front, with the two \nneglected advective processes supplying the remaining 20%. There is no clear \nunderstanding of how either of these two processes might respond to the spring-neap \ncycle, but with their relatively minor role in frontal nitrate supply the errors in the \nmodel comparisons are expected to be small. \n \nThe impacts of repeated blooms on the annual productivity of the front can be \nassessed in the model by comparing the cross-frontal integrated annual production \nwith just the M2 tide operating and with the spring-neap cycle (Fig. 7). With a spring-\nneap cycle, there is a clear overall increase in annual primary production at the \nposition of the front compared to with the M2 tide only (Fig. 7A). At the mean \nposition of the front of ( )310log h U =2.75 the effect of the spring-neap cycle is to add \nabout 50% to the annual primary production. Within the adjustment region (between \n2.4< ( )310log h U >2.75) the spring-neap cycle results in an average increase in annual \ncarbon fixation of about 70% above that of the M2 tide only. Within the frontal region \nthere is a comparable increase in the downward supply of carbon (Fig. 7B), as the \nspring tide remixing events redistribute the growth achieved during the last neap tide \nstratification. Clearly the spring-neap cycle could play an important role in the \nprimary production of shelf sea fronts. Any assessment of frontal ecosystems, both \npelagic and benthic, may need to include variability in the tidal mixing both as a \ndriver of significant extra primary productivity and as a source of regular variability in \nthe surface concentrations of phytoplankton and downward fluxes of organic carbon. \n \n \nFigure 7. \nThe impact of the spring-neap cycle on (A) annual carbon fixation and (B) annual vertical carbon flux \nfrom mixed (low ( )310log h U ) to stratified (high ( )310log h U ) shelf waters. The solid line is for \nthe model run with M2 tides only, and the dashed line is for the model with a spring-neap cycle. \nSharples\/Spring-neap cycle and primary production 17\n \nOn the stratified side of the tidal mixing front the modelled cycle of spring-\nneap changes in thermocline erosion and deepening are consistent with the \nsuggestions of Sharples et al., 2001. Variability in primary production rates within the \nthermocline is partially driven by spring-neap changes in the supply of nitrate (both \nbecause of the changes in mixing and in the strength of the vertical nitrate gradient), \nand also by the vertical excursion of the base of the thermocline through the light \ngradient (Fig. 6C). Pulses in thermocline biomass are predicted 1- 2 days after neap \ntides and appear to be curtailed by increased mixing in the bottom layer. The \nfortnightly modulation of thermocline growth rate resulted in almost 30% additional \ngrowth at spring tides compared to neaps. This is less than the factor of 2 difference in \ngrowth potentially driven by fluctuations in surface irradiance between cloudy and \nsunny days (Sharples et al, 2007), but it is still a potentially significant and predictable \nsource of variability in thermocline primary production. The periodic erosion of the \nbase of the thermocline leads to fortnightly variations in the flux of carbon into the \nbottom mixed layer (Fig. 6E), ranging between about 50 and 200 mg C m-2 d-1, with \nthe maximum fluxes occurring as the tidal currents increase towards spring tides. \nAssessing the integrated annual impact of the spring-neap cycle in a stratified region \n(Fig. 8) indicates that much of the apparently strong fortnightly signals in growth and \ncarbon export are averaged out over the year. On the stratified side of the front \n( ( )310log h U > 2.9) there is a small increase in annual primary production (Fig. 8A), \nwith spring-neap carbon production being about 15% higher than with the M2 tide \nonly. This increase in production decreases away from the front, with the spring-neap \nand M2 models predicting similar annual primary production above ( )310log h U =3.6. \nTaking the stratified Celtic Sea as an example, the mean depth is about 110 metres \nand, with M2 and S2 tidal current amplitudes of 0.35 and 0.14 m s-1 respectively, the \nmean cubed tidal currents is about 0.025 m3 s-3. Hence ( )310log h U is typically 3.6, \nsuggesting that spring-neap effects on the annual primary production of the region are \nnot significant. Based on the typical gradients of ( )310log h U , the limitation of the \neffects of the spring-neap cycle to ( )310log h U <3.6 would suggest the impacts to be \nlocal within a horizontal distance of 15 \u2013 50 km on the stratified side of the front. \nThere is no significant difference between the spring-neap and M2 predictions in \nannual fluxes of carbon out of the thermocline (Fig. 8B) away from the influence of \nthe front. Thus for primary production and carbon fluxes associated with the shelf sea \nseasonal thermocline, the importance of the spring-neap cycle may primarily be in \nterms of fortnightly variability in thermocline biomass and pulses in the flux of carbon \nto the bottom layer. Overall, at the front and within the stratified waters, the spring-\nneap response of the biological system is a consequence of the timescales of carbon \nfixation (e.g. turnover timescales of typically 2 days) allowing phytoplankton to take \nadvantage of the 7 days between extremes of mixing in the spring-neap cycle. It \nshould be emphasised that these predictions for spring-neap variability within the \nshelf sea seasonal thermocline are speculative; there are no direct observations of \nrates of primary production nor carbon export sufficient to resolve the spring-neap \ncycle. \n \nAll the above results and the validity of their interpretation rely on the \napplicability of the model. The biological model in particular has been kept simple; \nSharples\/Spring-neap cycle and primary production 18\nadding complexity to any ecosystem model always brings with it extra controlling \nparameters that are very often poorly constrained by observations. An implicit \nassumption in the interpretation of the results is that errors arising from model \nsimplifications are similar for both the model with M2 tide only and for the model \nwith the spring-neap cycle; i.e. in comparing the two model runs the errors cancel \nsufficiently to leave a reliable result. For instance, the modelled phytoplankton were \ngiven a fixed respiration rate (equation (8)), rather than a temperature-dependent rate. \nThis could result in errors in parts of the water column where the spring-neap cycle \nproduces markedly different temperatures. Within the region of the spring-neap \nfrontal adjustment the surface temperature varies between about 12\u00b0C and 13\u00b0C, \ncompared to a temperature of 12\u00b0C for the water adjacent to the front with the M2 tide \nonly (Fig. 3). On the stratified side of the front surface temperatures are generally \nidentical for both model runs, but at the base of the thermocline there is a narrow \nregion where the temperature oscillates by \u00b10.5\u00b0C in response to the spring-neap \ncycle. Using a Q10 description of phytoplankton respiration, with Q10 between 4 and \n9 (Lefevre et al., 1994) and a temperature change of 1\u00b0C, suggests a change in \nrespiration rate of 15 \u2013 25%. The biggest impact would be surface production in the \nspring-neap adjustment region. Assuming a growth rate of 1 d-1 and the modelled \nrespiration rate of 0.12 d-1 changing by 25% results in the growth-respiration balance \nchanging by only 4%, which is negligible compared to the predicted contrast in \nprimary production generated by the spring-neap cycle (Fig. 7A).  At the base of the \nthermocline, taking a growth rate of typically 0.25 d-1 suggests a potential oscillation \nin the growth-respiration balance of 30%. However, the base of the thermocline \ncontributes only about 10% to the water column primary production (Fig. 6D), so the \nerror associated with the fixed respiration rate here will be <4%. \n \nA second source of potential error is the fixed Chl:C ratio. This ratio has been \nseen to change by up to a factor of 4 in the Celtic Sea, ranging from 0.04 \u2013 0.03 mg \nChl (mg C)-1 in the thermocline and bottom mixed layer, 0.02 mg Chl (mg C)-1 in \nvertically-mixed regions, 0.02 \u2013 0.01 mg Chl (mg C)-1 at a tidal mixing front, and 0.01 \nmg Chl (mg C)-1 at the surface of a stratified water column (Holligan et al., 1984). \nThe value of 0.04 mg Chl (mg C)-1 used by the model is typical for the summer \nthermocline and for the pre-spring bloom mixed water column, regions which \ndominate the annual primary production and so contributing to the agreement with \nobserved Celtic Sea annual primary production rates. Lower Chl:C is likely to occur \nin surface waters during summer, either in the stratified region or in the frontal \ntransition region, and tend to reduce the primary production. The surface layer of the \nstratified region is not a concern, partially because production in the thermocline \ndominates (Fig. 6D) and also because the error would affect both the M2 and spring-\nneap runs similarly. Of potentially more significance is the fortnightly production \npredicted within the frontal transition region. Taking a summer surface PAR of 80 W \nm-2 distributed exponentially over the 10 m surface layer (a mean surface layer \nirradiance of 50 W m-2), then equation (8) suggests the effect of reducing Chl:C by a \nfactor of 2 \u2013 4 is to reduce the growth rate by about 5 \u2013 10%, so the error is \nsignificantly less than the contrast in frontal production between the M2 and the \nspring-neap model runs (Fig. 7A). \n \nA final possible source of error is the simplification of a fixed grazing impact, \nwhich might normally be expected to vary seasonally (Lee et al., 2002). Changes in \ngrazing impact might affect the model results of primary production within regions \nSharples\/Spring-neap cycle and primary production 19\nwhere there is marked spring-neap variability in biomass, i.e. the frontal transition \nregion and the summer thermocline. Some additional runs of the model were carried \nout to assess this, comparing M2 and spring-neap results using a grazing impact that \nfollows a seasonal cycle (see Fig. 4 of Lee et al., 2002). The results discussed earlier \n(Fig. 7) are quantitatively robust to this change in the treatment of grazing, both \nshowing the region of additional annual carbon fixation caused by spring-neap frontal \ntransition, and the increased production within the thermocline generated by the \nspring-neap cycle up to ( )310log h U = 3.6. \n \nIn conclusion, a model-based experiment has shown small but potentially \nsignificant effects of the spring-neap contrast of tidal mixing on the timing of the \nspring bloom, the primary production achieved by the bloom, and on the growth \nwithin, and downward carbon export from, the seasonal thermocline. These results are \nbroadly robust to key simplifications within the biological model. Any study of the \ninter-annual variability in shelf sea primary production should consider that it is not \nonly variability in meteorological forcing that may be driving the ecosystem. The \nstrongest impacts of the fortnightly mixing variability occur within 15 \u2013 50 km of the \nshelf sea tidal mixing fronts. Given the ecological importance of frontal regions as \nlocalised sources of organic fuel for the summer marine ecosystem, this has \nimplications for the minimum horizontal resolution required in 3-dimensional coupled \nphysics-ecosystem models of shelf systems. The impacts of the spring-neap cycle on \nthese regions is partially the result of the transitional stratification being more \nsusceptible to modulated mixing, but also because the time scale of the spring-neap \ncycle is suited to the response times inherent within the primary production. The \nmodel results are partially supported by available observations. However, further \nwork is required to assess the viability of the predictions, and to investigate the \npotential for regular physical forcing of the primary production having impacts at \nhigher trophic levels. \n \nAcknowledgements \nIn developing this modelling approach and its interpretation I have benefited greatly \nfrom many fruitful discussions on biological-physical interactions with John Simpson \n(University of Wales, Bangor), and Patrick Holligan and Mark Moore (University of \nSouthampton).
