Accepted for publication, January 2010 \n \n \nAbstract \nA high-resolution, airborne conductivity survey has proved spectacularly successful in \ndelineating the zones of carbonaceous mudstone (Moffat Shale Group) that form the \nstructural and stratigraphical base of individual, sandstone-dominated tracts within the \nNorthern Ireland sector of the Southern Uplands\u2013Down-Longford, Ordovician-\nSilurian accretionary terrane. The anomalies associated with both outcropping and \nconcealed mudstone allow the major, tract boundary faults to be plotted across large \nareas of poor exposure to reveal a large-scale regional swing in the strike of the major \ntract boundary faults from their prevalent ENE-WSW trend and into a NE-SW \norientation. The fault traces defined by the geophysical anomalies cut across those, \ndeduced by extrapolation into an area of sparse bedrock exposure, which are \nillustrated on the current geological map. A substantial revision of the regional fault \npattern is thus required.  In places the major tract boundary faults appear to \nanastomose into strike-slip duplexes, suggesting transpression in the accretionary \nregime. However, the wholesale realignment of the strike trend is likely to have had a \nlater, post-accretion origin, perhaps involving a releasing bend on a major, strike-\nparallel fault that controlled emplacement of the Newry granitoid pluton (425 Ma), \nand might also be associated with Au mineralization in Armagh and Monaghan.      \n \n 2\n \n \nThe paratectonic zone of the British and Irish Caledonides includes the Southern \nUplands \u2013 Down-Longford (SUDL) Terrane (Fig. 1), an imbricate thrust belt of \nturbidite-facies strata that developed from the late Ordovician to the mid-Silurian \nalong the Laurentian margin of the Iapetus Ocean. The Southern Upland Fault forms \nthe NW margin of the terrane which, at its southern margin, occupies the hanging wall \nof the Iapetus Suture (Fig. 1). The SUDL Terrane has outcrop areas of about 10 000 \nkm2 in southern Scotland and about 6 000 km2 in Ireland (Fig. 1), where the outcrop \nextends across much of Counties Down and Armagh in Northern Ireland (c. 3 500 \nkm2) and thence into the Republic of Ireland, mostly within parts of Counties Louth, \nMonaghan, Cavan and Longford (c. 2 500 km2). \n \nInternally, the terrane comprises at least 20 fault-defined tracts elongated NE-SW \nparallel to strike, in most of which the strata are steeply inclined and become younger \ntowards the NW; in contrast, the minimum ages of individual tracts generally become \nsequentially younger towards the SE (Floyd 2001 and references therein). Each tract \ncomprises a thick sandstone succession (up to 2 km) typically underlain by a thin \nmudstone unit (<150 m). Within the Scottish Southern Uplands the minimum age of \nthe component tracts ranges from Caradoc (Late Ordovician) in the NW adjacent to \nthe Southern Upland Fault, to Wenlock (Mid-Silurian) in the SE adjacent to the \nIapetus Suture. In Northern Ireland the stratigraphical range at outcrop is more \nrestricted than that seen in Scotland. The north-western terrane boundary, the \ncontinuation of the Southern Upland Fault, is overstepped by Carboniferous and \nyounger strata so that the outcrop area of Ordovician tracts is limited and the \nequivalents to the northernmost tracts of the Southern Uplands, if present, are \nconcealed; rather more Ordovician strata crop out in the Irish Republic. The south-\neast limit of the terrane lies within the Irish Republic, where Wenlock strata have \nbeen reported from County Louth (Vaughan & Johnson 1992); elsewhere the \nWenlock and the youngest of the Llandovery tracts are unconformably overlain by \nCarboniferous strata. Thus the outcrop of the SUDL Terrane in Northern Ireland \nlargely comprises Llandovery tracts of the Gala and Hawick Groups. A more detailed \ncorrelation has been established (Barnes et al. 1987) for the Gala and Hawick tracts \non either side of the North Channel, in the Rhins of Galloway (Scotland) and the Ards \n 3\nPeninsula (Northern Ireland). From this it is apparent that the Gala Group outcrop has \na significantly larger cross-strike width in Northern Ireland (c. 27 km) than in south-\nwest Scotland (c. 16 km) and that it contains more individual tracts. \n \nIn south-west Scotland the SUDL terrane is intruded by granitic plutons of Early \nDevonian age. The Loch Doon pluton was emplaced into the Ordovician sector, the \nCairnsmore of Fleet pluton into the Gala Group, and the Criffel pluton into the \nHawick Group. In Northern Ireland, the Newry granodiorite pluton, of probable Late \nSilurian age, straddles the Gala-Hawick group boundary, and at its western end has \nitself been intruded by the Palaeogene Slieve Gullion central complex. Other largely \ngranitic, Palaeogene intrusions into the Hawick Group, make up the Mourne \nMountains central complex. \n \nDespite the geological similarities between the Scottish and Irish sectors of the \nterrane, there are marked topographical differences strongly influenced by contrasting \nhistories of glaciation. In Scotland, the Southern Uplands region is a range of \nmoorland hills with summit plateaux, rising to well over 300 m OD, mostly either \nformed in exposed bedrock or in bedrock covered by only a thin veneer of peat and \nglacial deposits. Fast-flowing streams draining the high ground commonly cut \nthrough the flanking glacial deposits to expose bedrock. In contrast, the SUDL terrane \nin Northern Ireland forms low-lying agricultural land much of which is below 100 m \nOD. Natural exposure is uncommon and the gently-flowing streams only rarely cut \ndown to bedrock through the thick surface layer of drumlinised till; individual \ndrumlins rise from 5 to 50 m. This inevitably means more uncertainty in geological \ninterpretation for Down-Armagh than for the Scottish Southern Uplands, where the \nmore abundant bedrock exposure provides better control. \n \nThis paper is concerned primarily with the Northern Irish part of the terrane (hereafter \nDown-Armagh), for which new high-resolution geophysical data were acquired in \n2005-2006 as part of the Tellus programme of geological exploration, managed by the \nGeological Survey of Northern Ireland and funded by the Department of Enterprise, \nTrade and Investment. The particular importance of the geophysical data lies in the \ninsight it brings to bear on a large poorly exposed area, but one in which contrasting \nlithologies have markedly different physical properties. \n 4\n \nMapping of the electrical conductivity constrasts is provided by the airborne \nelectromagnetic (AEM) component of the geophysical survey data. Conductivity is a \nfundamental electrical property of rocks. The bulk, or formation, conductivity that is \nmeasured by the AEM survey, may be influenced by a number of factors including \nmineralogy, porosity and fluid content. These associations allow the survey data to be \nused across a range of geological and structural investigations. The data, of \nthemselves, do not provide discrimination with regard to the prevailing mechanism(s) \ncontrolling any observed variation in the property and this becomes a matter of \ninterpretation.  The AEM measurement provides a spatial average of bulk \nconductivity  across a significant subsurface volume (Beamish, 2004). Depth \ndiscrimination is largely provided by the measurement frequencies employed with \ndepth of penetration increasing with decreasing frequency. The single frequency data \nset used here is typically most sensitive to variations across a lateral distance of ~180 \nm and a depth range from ~60 to 100 m. \n \n The AEM data set reveals a marked conductivity contrast between the dominant \nsandstone lithology and the less abundant, more conductive, carbonaceous mudstone \nof the Moffat Shale Group that forms the base of the sequence within each structural \ntract and which has been utilized as a fissile d\u00e9collement horizon during thrust \nimbrication. We utilize the quasi-linear conductivity anomalies that arise from this \ncontrast to reassess the structural configuration of the SUDL terrane in Down-\nLongford, and its representation on the current published geological map (Geological \nSurvey of Northern Ireland 1997). A greater complexity of faulting can be \ndemonstrated than has been previously appreciated, whilst there is a major deviation \nin the regional strike away from the prevalent ENE-WSW trend illustrated on that \nmap. \n \nThe regional tectonostratigraphic setting \n \n \nThe structural geometry of the SUDL terrane developed within an accretionary thrust \ncomplex at the Laurentian continental margin during northward subduction of the \nIapetus Ocean (Leggett et al. 1979; Anderson 2001, 2004; Stone & Merriman 2004 \nand references therein). The sequential incorporation of tectonic tracts into an active \n 5\nthrust system means that the first deformation was diachronous, older in the north \nthan in the south (Barnes et al. 1989), and the structural profiles can vary along strike \n(Rushton et al. 1996). Each tract ideally comprises a very thin (generally <150 m) \nblack shale sequence (the Moffat Shale Group) overlain by a very much thicker (up to \nabout 2 000 m) sandstone succession. The Moffat Shale Group (MSG) may span a \nrange of late Ordovician to Silurian graptolite biozones, the upper limit becoming \nyounger southward, but it is rare for the sandstone succession to contain strata \nspanning more than one biozone (Floyd 2001). Each biozone represents an interval of \nabout 1.5 million years in the late Ordovician, reducing to nearer 0.5 million years by \nthe mid-Silurian (Hughes 1995). The tract relationships are the critical evidence for \nthe imbricate thrust geometry. \n \nWhilst much of the detailed work on the SUDL terrane has been in the Scottish sector, \nits application to the Northern Ireland sector is well established. In regional terms \n(Fig. 1), the northern tracts of Caradoc and Ashgill (Upper Ordovician) age comprise \nthe Leadhills Supergroup (Floyd 1996) for which the Orlock Bridge Fault (Anderson \n& Oliver 1986) forms the southern margin. This zone is also known as the Northern \nBelt, following Peach & Horne (1899); though originally applied in southern Scotland \nthe term is also in common usage for the Ordovician rocks north of the Orlock Bridge \nFault in Ireland. Southwards from the Orlock Bridge Fault in south-west Scotland, \nand as far as the Balmae Burn Fault, a series of Llandovery (Lower Silurian) tracts \nforms the Gala and Hawick groups. These two groups are separated from each other \nby the Laurieston Fault in Scotland (Akhurst et al. 2001), the equivalent structure in \nNorthern Ireland being known as the Cloghy Fault (Anderson and Cameron 1979). \nFollowing Peach and Horne (1899) the whole Llandovery zone, together with its \nMSG Ordovician inliers, is also known as the Central Belt throughout the SUDL \nterrane. South of the Balmae Burn Fault in Scotland, the Riccarton Group comprises \nWenlock (Middle Silurian) tracts and is otherwise known as the Southern Belt (Peach \n& Horne 1899); there is no equivalent at outcrop in Northern Ireland though Wenlock \nstrata occur some 22 km to the south in the Irish Republic (Vaughan & Johnson \n1992). \n \nDespite the broad, large-scale continuity of the structural tracts and their boundary \nfaults there is considerable variation in the detail of the thrust architecture along \n 6\nstrike. Rushton et al. (1996) have discussed variation within the Southern Uplands \nsector of the SUDL terrane in terms of a prograding thrust front being locally \nobstructed with resulting development of back thrusts (creating structural pop-ups) \nand out-of-sequence thrusts (cf. McCurry & Anderson, 1989). It is also clear that the \naccretion of the youngest Gala Group (and some subsequent) tracts was effected \nunder the influence of a sinistrally transpressive stress regime. This was a widespread \nphenomenon during the Silurian closure of the Iapetus Ocean (Anderson 1987, 2001; \nSoper et al. 1992). \n \nThe Central Belt represents a far greater proportion of the SUDL terrane in Northern \nIreland than it does in south-west Scotland. There would appear to be more similarity \nwith the north-east of the Scottish sector, where the Ordovician tracts are eliminated \nby a combination of faulting and an unconformable cover of Carboniferous strata. In \ntandem with this effect, the Scottish Central Belt widens progressively north-eastward \nthrough the multiplication of Hawick Group tracts and the introduction of an \neastward-broadening structural wedge, bounded by the Moffat Valley and Ettrick \nValley faults, in which several tracts have compositional characteristics that are in \nsome ways intermediate between the Gala and Hawick groups. If these are assigned to \nthe Gala Group there is a corresponding increase in the number of younger tracts \ntherein, but the effect on the Group\u2019s outcrop width is mitigated by a loss of older \nGala Group tracts (Rushton et al. 1996). So, for example, in the Rhins of Galloway \nthe Gala Group outcrop has been divided into a series of structural tracts (Stone 1995) \nnumbered in terms of age from 1 (the oldest, most northerly tract) to 8 (the youngest \nand most southerly tract; tracts 7 and 8 form the southern 25% of the Gala Group\u2019s \noutcrop width. This compares with the situation farther north-east, in the Peebles \ndistrict, where the repetition of Gala 7 tracts, coupled with the structural elimination \nof several younger tracts, means that strata of Gala 7 age make up about 75% of the \nGroup\u2019s outcrop (Rushton et al., 1996). A comparable situation is described from \nNorthern Ireland (Anderson, 2004) where, on the Ards Peninsula, tracts of Gala 7 age \n(or younger) make up almost 80% of the Gala Group\u2019s outcrop width. In this respect \nan important correlative structure is the major strike fault marking the northern limit \nof Gala 7 tracts: the Drumbreddan Bay Fault in south-west Scotland, the Southern \nCoalpit Bay Fault in Northern Ireland. \n \n 7\n \nIndependent confirmation of the compositional continuity within individual tracts is \nprovided by regional geochemical data derived from the systematic analysis of stream \nsediment. Over the Southern Uplands, the pattern of bedrock tracts, extended NE-SW \nalong strike but relatively narrow in the NW-SW cross-strike direction, is mirrored in \nthe striped patterns of element distribution seen in the British Geological Survey\u2019s \nregional geochemical dataset (G-BASE: British Geological Survey 1993). Despite \nglaciation, the stream sediment geochemical patterns spatially mimic the outcrop of \nunderlying bedrock lithologies so that, over the sandstone-dominated tracts of the \nSouthern Uplands sector of the SUDL terrane, contoured regional geochemical data \nfor many elements produce a marked strike-parallel, NE-SW linearity. Although the \nsteepest concentration gradients commonly coincide with tract-bounding faults, \ndifferent elements show different distribution patterns, a relationship that has been \ninterpreted as reflecting the compositional contrasts between the sandstones contained \nwithin the various tracts (Stone et al. 1999, 2004 and references therein). Regional \ngeochemical data collected as part of the Tellus programme show that comparable \npatterns of element distribution can be established over the Northern Ireland sector of \nthe SUDL terrane. \n \nIn Down-Armagh, a pattern of generally linear, fault-defined tracts similar to that seen \nin the Southern Uplands has been well established in the fairly continuous outcrop on \nthe County Down coast (Anderson and Cameron 1979, Cameron 1981, Craig 1984) \nand then extrapolated westward, with much less certainty, across inland Down and \nArmagh using the relatively small number of MSG outcrops and an even smaller \nnumber of age determinations based on the contained graptolites.  As we demonstrate \nbelow, the new conductivity data dictate a significant revision of the current tract \nmaps, particularly in western Armagh, where the Lower Palaeozoic rocks have not \nbeen mapped for over a century and are probably less well exposed than in any other \npart of the SUDL Terrane. \n \nGeophysical methodology \n \nThe Tellus airborne geophysical survey collected magnetic, radiometric and \nelectromagnetic (EM) data at 200 m line intervals across Northern Ireland. The \n 8\nnominal flight height was 56 m and survey lines were oriented at 345 degrees, \nroughly perpendicular to the Down-Armagh tract boundaries. The present study uses \nthe EM data obtained across the SUDL terrane with a sampling interval of ~15 m \nalong the flight direction. The Tellus project acquired two-frequency EM data (3 and \n14 kHz) in 2005 across the western area and four-frequency data (0.9, 3, 12 and 25 \nkHz) across the eastern area in 2006. The lowest, and deepest penetrating, common \nfrequency across the entire SUDL Terrane is provided by the data acquired at 3 kHz. \n \nThe 3 kHz EM data have been converted to a half-space (i.e. a model that is vertically \nuniform) estimate of apparent conductivity. The inversion method is described by \nBeamish (2002).  The 3 kHz model estimates, when gridded, form a map of the \nconductivity distribution that is most influenced by conductivity variations in the \nupper 60 to 100 m. In order to extract more precise depth information, multi-\nfrequency inversion is used to provide multi-layer models. There are two main \ninterpretation issues that arise when AEM data survey data are obtained across \npopulated areas. The first is that air-space regulations require a high-fly condition \nabove built structures and this results in reduction\/loss of signal-to-noise. The second \nissue arises from a variety of noise sources such as power lines. These perturbations \nto the conductivity results are invariably high-wavenumber and produce quasi-linear \nanomalies. \n \nThe SUDL Terrane is pervasively resistive and structural influences on conductivity \nvariations arise as largely weak, laterally compact, conductive features. At- and near-\nsurface variations provide the strongest anomalies (Fig. 2); it is apparent however \n(from modeling studies) that many of the conductive features exist at depths in excess \nof 60 m. This makes assessments of spatial continuity difficult. For this particular \nproblem we have used a transform that has only been previously applied to magnetic \nfield data. The transform used is the Tilt Angle or Tilt Derivative (TDR) as defined by \nMillar & Singh (1994) and discussed by Verduzco et al. (2004).  The TDR transform, \nas applied to EM data, amplifies and normalizes all the lateral gradients in the \nconductivity distribution and provides a map outlining all the conductive features. The \nTDR transform is formed by taking the arctangent of the ratio of the vertical to total \nhorizontal field derivatives. The arctangent function restricts the transform to a range \nfrom -90 degrees to 90 degrees. When applied to conductivity data, the mapping of \n 9\nthe TDR transform across the interval from 0 degrees to 90 degrees allows the centre \nand width of conductive zones to be identified (Beamish, 2009). Geological features \nand cultural noise may be equally amplified. Deeper geological features tend to be \nassociated with signals of longer spatial wavelength so that some filtering of the high-\nwavenumber, highly localized features may be undertaken to assist with tracing the \nweaker conductive features in the data. When referring to anomalies we refer to the \nconductive features (here largely interpreted as the MSG) that are distinct , by virtue \nof being laterally compact and more conductive, than the dominant sandstone \nlithologies. Features thought to be due to power-lines and roads have been identified \nto allow a more robust geological interpretation. \n  \n              \nCorrelation of geological and geophysical features  \n \nA conductivity contrast would be expected between the dominant sandstone lithology \nand the less abundant mudstone, in particular, the carbonaceous MSG strata that form \nthe d\u00e9collement horizon at the stratigraphical base of many of the structural tracts. \nSuch a lithological contrast would seem to be the likely cause of the linear, though \nsomewhat sinuous, NNE-SSW anomaly pattern (Figure 2), but the association can be \nmost convincingly demonstrated in the geological situation with least lithological \ncontrast. This is found in the south-east of County Down where much of the outcrop \nconsists of Hawick Group strata contained within several structural tracts (Figure 3). \nIn general, the Hawick Group tracts do not feature a basal sequence of black shale, \nand so would not be expected to have any associated conductivity anomaly. A rare \nexception to this generality is seen extending south-westwards from the southern end \nof the Ards Peninsula where a Hawick Group tract has, at its stratigraphical base,  the \nTieveshilly Shales and Mudstones, a component unit of the Moffat Shale Group and \nabout 80 m thick (Anderson & Rickards 2000). In the outcrop on the Ards Peninsula \nthe Tieveshilly strata lie in the core of a hanging-wall anticline developed \nimmediately north of the major Tieveshilly Fault and separated from that fault by the \noverlying Gala Group Tara Sandstone Formation (Anderson 2004, figures 4.3 and \n4.5). The outcrop of Tieveshilly Shales and Mudstones in the core of the anticline \ncoincides with a linear conductivity anomaly (A on Figure 3) which, when traced to \nthe south-west (B on Figure 3), shows that the southern limb of the anticline is \n 10\nprogressively cut out so that the Tieveshilly strata are brought into proximity with the \nfault. This is a neat demonstration of the association of the conductivity anomaly with \nthe MSG lithology rather than with some specifically fault-related feature. The \noutcrops of MSG black mudstone extending south-west from Tieveshilly are mapped \non the Northern Ireland, 1: 250 000 sheet (Geological Survey of Northern Ireland \n1997) as lenticular bodies arranged in a linear zone defining a major tract boundary. \nClosely coincident with that zone is a linear conductivity anomaly that strongly \nsuggests unexposed continuity between the MSG inliers. A linear west-southwestward \nextension of a conductivity anomaly for some distance beyond the most southwesterly \nof the exposed MSG inliers (C on Figure 3) is best explained by the unexposed \ncontinuity of the mudstone lithology, albeit the along-strike-correlation is complicated \nby approximately north-south cross-faults. \n \nThe coincidence of the linear Moffat Shale zone with a conductivity anomaly, in an \narea which is otherwise devoid of carbonaceous mudstone and relatively bland in \nconductivity terms, is strongly supportive of a more general association between the \nMSG lithology and zones of increased conductivity.   Carrying this association \nnorthwards in Figure 3, to the vicinity of Downpatrick, there is another linear \nconductivity anomaly, parallel to the Tieveshilly zone and in part coincident with the \ntract boundary separating the Gala and Hawick groups, the Cloghy Fault (Anderson & \nCameron 1979). The conductivity anomaly suggests the presence of unexposed MSG \nmudstone at the base of the southernmost Gala Group tract, and that the boundary \nbetween the Gala and Hawick groups, as it runs NE from Downpatrick, is less \naffected by faulting than has been supposed. However, at this point a note of caution \nis justified, as follows.  \n \nMoffat Shale Group strata have not been recorded along the Cloghy Fault. Further, \nthe Gala Group tract to the north (the Portavogie tract of Anderson & Cameron 1979) \nis structurally anomalous in that the majority of its beds young towards the south, \nwithin the northern limb of a large (and relatively simple) syncline. The hinge zone of \nthe syncline lies close to the Cloghy Fault and there is insufficient room for a \nsymmetrically large and equivalent southern limb between the hinge zone and the \nfault (for a full structural illustration see Anderson & Cameron\u2019s figure 2). From these \nobservations it is difficult to see how MSG strata could be introduced into the Cloghy \n 11\nFault zone, and it is possible that the conductivity anomaly here has a different origin, \nperhaps associated with mineralization (e.g. due to contact metamorphism associated \nwith possible lamprophyres along the fault) . However, note that in this case the \nconductivity anomaly still identifies the major tract boundary fault even if the MSG is \nabsent. An illustration of the converse effect \u2013 the absence of an anomaly where there \nis no MSG present \u2013 is provided by the Orlock Bridge Fault in the north of County \nDown. There, the MSG carbonaceous mudstone does not crop out along the well \nexposed trace of the fault, which is nonetheless marked by intense sinistral shear and \nseparates two distinct structural tracts, Ordovician to the north and Silurian to the \nsouth. \n \nDespite the qualifications outlined above, we are satisfied that there is a consistent \ncorrelation between the linear conductivity anomalies and the surface traces of the \nmajor, tract-boundary faults some of which are  defined by the lenticular zones of \nMSG mudstone. Applying that association regionally, a wealth of structural \nimbrication is revealed (Fig. 2). Moreover, much of the imbrication thus revealed \ndoes not coincide with the interpretations derived from the very limited MSG outcrop. \nTwo areas are illustrative of the complexity. In the Banbridge area sinuous linkages \nbetween the main tract boundaries appear to define a sinistral strike-slip duplex \nstructure, whilst further SW, between Keady and Newry, the trend defined by the \nconductivity lineaments is more NNE-SSW and appears to cut obliquely \nacross the tract boundaries as currently depicted on the 1: 250 000 map of the solid \ngeology of Northern Ireland (1997). Either there is considerable linkage between the \nmajor strike-slip faults with MSG strata present on the linking faults but largely \nabsent on the roof and floor structures or, and we think this the more likely, there is a \nregional swing in strike that is not recognized in current interpretations. It is worth \nnoting that current interpretations of the area most affected by the apparent swing in \nregional strike are still largely based on mapping by the Geological Survey of Ireland \nin about 1870. \n \nBanbridge: a strike-slip duplex? \n \nTo the east of Banbridge there is a strong conductivity anomaly associated with the \nwestward extension of the Southern Coalpit Bay Fault, which marks the northern limit \n 12\nof Gala 7 tracts. From the Ards Peninsula this combined lineament has followed the \nregional, WSW trend, but south of Banbridge the conductivity anomaly takes a \nmarked anticlockwise swing towards the SW (Figure 4), deviating from the WSW \ntrace assigned to the Southern Coalpit Bay Fault on the Northern Ireland 1:250 000 \ngeological map. The well-defined conductivity lineament may mark the northern \nboundary of a strike-slip duplex \u2013 either extensional\/sinistral or contractional\/dextral \n\u2013 but the potential southern boundary fault, though implied by the conductivity data, \nis not so clearly defined. From the outline fault pattern alone it is not possible to \ndistinguish definitively between sinistral and dextral duplexes (Woodcock & Fischer \n1986, see especially their fig. 1). Sinistral transpression has certainly occurred within \nthe SUDL terrane (for evidence and review see Anderson 1987, 2001, 2004 and \nPhillips et al. 1995) and there is no regional evidence for any significant dextral \nmovement. Indeed, where small-scale strike-slip duplex features have been noted in \nassociation with the major faults, as for example at Coalpit Bay (TBA, unpublished \nmapping) adjacent to the Southern Coalpit Bay Fault (Fig. 1), they are exclusively \nsinistral.  Hence an interpretation of the large-scale, Banbridge duplex as an \nextensional\/sinistral structure is favoured here. A few other such tentative features can \nbe identified in the conductivity data for the central part of the Down-Armagh belt, \nand their occurrence may partly explain the apparent strike swing in that region. \n \nExtrapolating from the duplex model, one interpretation of the regional structure as \nderived from the conductivity data might be to view the apparently intersecting \nstructural trends as being created by a network of sinistral, extensional strike-slip \nduplexes. Alternatively, the conductivity contrasts might be assigned to sandstone-\nmudstone variations within the tract sequences, in which case an overall structural \n\u201cgrain\u201d will be identified rather than the repetition of a particular basal horizon. If, as \nwe believe, the conductivity anomalies are produced by linear outcrops of Moffat \nShale, it is most likely that they represent structural planes developed during the \ninitial imbrication of the sequence, probably as part of an underthrusting process \nactive during development of the SUDL terrane as an accretionary complex. In terms \nof an orthodox thrust model, the NNE-SSW features could then have formed as \nimbricate splays linking the original floor and roof thrusts (the major NE-SW strike \nfaults) in a structural duplex. However, the broadening of the Central Belt, and the \ncommensurate structural repetition of tracts within that broadened zone, rather \n 13\nsuggests a more complex arrangement of asymmetrical and overlapping ramp \nanticlines. These could be envisaged as growing south-westwards from a single basal \nthrust, to maintain the dominant sense of younging seen in the exposed accretionary \ncomplex but they must have remained a hinterland-dipping sequence. Alternatively, a \nfurther activity such as out-of-sequence breaching thrusts could be invoked. Where \nfully developed such structures would be expected to displace the original roof thrust \nbut, in the circumstances of the SUDL complex, might have merged with it towards \nthe north-east, whilst developing independently as tract boundaries towards the south-\nwest.  \n \nThe preceding paragraph is largely speculative. The SUDL accretionary complex, \nthough developed within a convergent tectonic regime, does not appear as a typical \nthrust stack and the problems of its structural interpretation, beyond the scope of this \npaper, have been examined by Anderson (2001). One fundamental problem has \nalways been the reliable extrapolation and correlation of the major tract-boundary \nfaults. Current interpretations lean heavily on the identification of Moffat Shale Group \ninliers, and the biostratigraphy of their contained graptolite faunas, in particular the \nrecognition of the youngest biozone. Inevitably, there is a degree of uncertainty in \nthese interpretations, much of which should be removed by the integration of the \nconductivity anomalies into a regional structural assessment. For the first time, \ncorrelation of Moffat Shale inliers along the major faults can be confirmed \nindependently and unequivocally.    \n  \nKeady \u2013 Newry \u2013 Crossmaglen: a regional re-orientation of tract boundaries \n \nThe trend of the conductivity lineaments becomes more markedly divergent from the \nprevalent, putative ENE-WSW strike in the western part of the Down-Armagh belt \n(Fig. 5). Further, in this area of SW Armagh, there is little indication that the \nconductivity lineaments are linked by possible strike-slip duplexes as described above \nfrom Banbridge. Instead, the lineaments, as identifiers of narrow, Moffat Shale zones, \ndefine a series of sub-parallel faults. These have a separation similar to the widths of \nthe individual accretionary tracts throughout the SUDL Terrane. They simply swing \ninto more NE-SW trends than have previously been accorded to the Down-Armagh \ntract boundary faults.  \n 14\n \nThe current 1: 250 000 map interpretation of the Keady area of west Armagh has used \nthe black shale outcrops (MSG) mapped on Sheet 59 of the Geological Survey of \nIreland (1875) to help extrapolate the tract boundaries which trend about 060\u00b0 across \nCounty Down westward into and across Armagh. Some necessarily sinistral \n(southerly) offset of the tract boundary faults as they are followed westward is \naccommodated by sinistral, cross-strike wrench faulting. However the essentially \nrectilinear extrapolation postulated appears to overlook the local evidence for strike \nvariation, recorded as dip arrows on the 19th century \u201cone-inch\u201d sheets.  For example, \nsouth of Newtonhamilton (see Fig. 5) the mean strike recorded in a 30 km2 area of \nGSI Sheet 59 is 037\u00b0, exactly parallel to the trend of the linear conductivity anomalies \nacross that same area. Our interpretation of the conductivity anomalies eliminates the \nneed for most of the cross-strike wrench faults and diminishes the importance of the \nremainder.  \n \nAs described previously, graptolite biostratigraphy provides some control on tract \nallocation, with the youngest fauna at any one location the crucial feature. The more \nNE-SW trend for the tract boundaries determined from the conductivity lineaments \nbrings the older, northern tracts farther south without recourse to cross-cutting strike-\nslips; one possible arrangement is illustrated in Figure 6. Whereas biostratigraphic \ncontrol in the eastern part of the Down-Armagh belt is good, reliable data become \nincreasingly sparse westward so that the currently available information seems \npermissive of the interpretation based on the conductivity lineaments. Future fossil \ndiscoveries, and reassessment of existing faunas, will test its applicability, though it is \nunlikely that resolution will be achieved without additional stratigraphical studies in \nNorthern Ireland focused on the western part of the SUDL Terrane.  \n \nThe strike-swing interpretation reduces the role of cross-strike faulting but does not of \nitself necessarily account for the westward broadening of the Gala Group\u2019s outcrop in \nDown-Armagh, unless the northward dip of the boundary faults decreases. This does \nnot seem to be a systematic effect. Instead, at least one additional tract can be deduced \n(Gala 4-south), broadening westward from a position to the north of Banbridge \n(Figure 6), whilst the possibility of transpressive strike-slip duplex arrays in the \nwestern part of the terrane will also effectively broaden the outcrop of each individual \n 15\ntract. The introduction in Down-Armagh of an additional tract (or tracts) broadening \nwestwards is a mirror-image of the situation seen in the Southern Uplands where, to \nthe east of Moffat, additional tracts expand eastwards to broaden the outcrop of the \nLlandovery Central Belt. \n \nA further, major feature which might be linked with the deviation in regional strike is \nemplacement of the Newry granodioritic pluton. It is tempting to see that \nemplacement as occurring, in a transtensional regime, at a releasing bend on a major, \nstrike-parallel fault of sinistral sense. The Cloghy Fault seems an obvious candidate. \nThe c. 425 Ma age of the Newry pluton (Meighan et al. 2003) would then date the \nstrike reorganization. If the 425 Ma date is accepted, it requires structural accretion \nand strike rotation to have occurred within a few million years of sedimentation of the \nUpper Llandovery, Gala Group strata. Mineralisation is another feature within the \nzone of regional strike deviation that might have been influenced by formation of a \nreleasing bend. For example, the belt of gold mineralization in south Armagh and \nneighbouring County Monaghan could have resulted from the releasing bend  \nallowing access to mineralizing fluids. \n \nConclusions \n \nThe high resolution conductivity data acquired during the Tellus survey proved \nspectacularly successful in delineating the zones of black, carbonaceous mudstone \n(Moffat Shale Group) that form the structural and stratigraphical base of individual \ntracts within the Southern Uplands \u2013 Down-Longford accretionary terrane. The quasi-\nlinear anomalies associated with the mudstone allow the major, tract boundary faults \nto be plotted across large areas of poor exposure in Down-Armagh and reveal hitherto \nunrecognised structural complication. Two features are most apparent: \n1. In the western part of Down-Armagh, there is a large-scale regional swing in \nthe strike of the major tract boundary faults away from their generally \nprevalent ENE-WSW trend into a NE-SW orientation. As a result, they cut \nacross the traces deduced for the faults from sparse bedrock exposure and \nillustrated on the current geological map. We suggest that a substantial \ngeological re-assessment is appropriate, with an improved knowledge of the \n 16\nbiostratigraphy of the Moffat Shale Group likely to provide the best means of \ntesting the interpretation derived from the conductivity survey. \n2. In places the major tract boundary faults appear to anastomose into sinistral \nstrike-slip duplexes, with the effect most marked from the Gala 6 tracts \nsouthwards. This would not be an unexpected development if an element of \nlateral movement was involved in the accretionary regime. Sinistral \ntranspression during accretion is well-established from the late Llandovery, \nduring incorporation of Gala 7 tracts in the Southern Uplands, so may have \ncommenced a little earlier than previously thought. \n \nThough the development of an anastomosing strike-slip duplex array would have been \na primary effect during accretion, the wholesale deviation of the Caledonian strike \ntrend may well have a later origin. Post-accretion, Late Silurian transtension across \nthe Iapetus suture zone (Soper and Woodcock 2003) would seem a likely mechanism \nwith, perhaps, the strike-swing in western Down-Armagh indicative of a releasing \nbend on a major-strike-parallel fault that controlled emplacement of the Newry \npluton. \n \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements. \nWe gratefully acknowledge two referees, Professors Kathy Whaler and Chris \nStillman, whose comments improved our manuscript.The data in the case study come \nfrom the Tellus Project which was funded by DETI and by the Building Sustainable \nProsperity scheme of the Rural Development Programme (Department of Agriculture \nand Rural Development of Northern Ireland).
