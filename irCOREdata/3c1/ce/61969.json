Carnivory in plants is thought to enhance growth through an increased supply 2 \nof nutrients, although there are considerable costs involved. It has been \nassumed that the relative investment of biomass in traps is inversely \nproportional to the availability of nutrients from non-carnivorous sources. Our \naim was to test the effect of increasing nutrient concentration on investment in \ncarnivory by Utricularia vulgaris. \n2. Plants were grown under controlled conditions and nitrogen and phosphorus 8 \nadded at three loadings in a crossed design. Investment in carnivory was \nassessed as the proportion of i) leaf biomass and ii) leaf area comprising traps.   \n3. There was no effect of nutrient additions on plant growth or periphyton \nabundance. Investment in carnivory declined with increasing phosphorus \nloading. There was no effect of nitrogen, despite this being the nutrient \ncommonly thought to be sought by carnivorous plants. Analysis of previously \npublished data also indicated a decline in investment with increasing P \navailability.  \n4. Investment in carnivory in U. vulgaris is inversely proportional to the \navailability of phosphorus from non-carnivorous sources. \n \nKey words:  Bladderwort, carnivorous plant, investment, macrophyte, nutrients, prey, \ntraps, Utricularia vulgaris. \n 2\n Introduction 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nCarnivory in plants is a bizarre phenomenon, a complete reversal of the usual \nfeeding relationship between plants and animals, and one that has fascinated scientists \nand natural historians for a very long time (Darwin, 1875). The unusual nature of \nthese plants even lead to confusion over their classification, with carnivorous plants \nbeing put into a taxon separate from both plants and animals (Juniper, Robins & Joel \n1989). However, it is now generally assumed that carnivory has evolved to enhance \nthe supply of mineral nutrients in habitats where growth is severely restricted by their \nsupply (Heslop-Harrison, 1978).  \nTypically it is assumed that N is the most important nutrient derived from \ncarnivory (Ellison & Gotelli, 2001; Guisande et al., 2004). In the bladderwort \nUtricularia vulgaris L., 51.8% of the total nitrogen content has been estimated to \ncome from insect-derived nitrogen (Friday & Quarmby, 1994). Such a substantial \ncontribution of nitrogen from animal prey is not atypical of carnivorous plants, with \nestimates ranging from 10 to 87% dependent on taxa (Ellison & Gotelli, 2001). \nNevertheless, other nutrients could be gained through carnivory. Carnivorous \nplants release a variety of enzymes to digest prey, including esterase, protease, \nribonuclease and acid phosphatase (Heslop-Harrison, 1978) and they take up other \nminerals from prey (Lollar, Coleman & Boyd, 1971). \nA cost-benefit model of carnivory has been described where any gains, in \nterms of increased availability of nutrients, are offset by its costs, direct and indirect \n(Givnish et al., 1984). Direct costs comprise those involved in the production and \nmaintenance of the organs necessary for the attraction, capture and digestion of prey \n(Friday, 1992; Adamec, 1997; Mendez & Karlsson, 1999). Production costs will \ndepend upon the size and complexity of the traps. Maintenance costs are likely to be \n 3\n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nparticularly high in those species that capture their prey by means of active traps [e.g. \nvenus fly-trap (Dionaea muscipula Soland. ex Ellis), bladderworts (Utricularia spp.)], \ncompared to species with passive traps [e.g. bromeliads (Bromeliaceae), pitcher plants \n(Sarraceniaceae)]. In U. vulgaris, for example, the traps take up to 40 minutes to reset \nonce the prey is captured (Friday, 1991). Indirect costs of carnivory are a consequence \nof a reduced photosynthetic efficiency of traps compared to conventional foliage \n(Friday, 1992). \nThus, there is a trade-off between photosynthetic costs and benefits. The \nGivnish et al. cost-benefit model (1984) predicts that the net photosynthetic benefit of \ncarnivory, and thus investment in it at the species or community level, should decline \nwith increased availability of nutrients in the surrounding medium.  \nThe common or greater bladderwort Utricularia vulgaris is a free-floating, \nsubmerged, aquatic plant that grows in low nutrient standing freshwaters. The plant \ngets its name from the traps, called bladders or utricles, on the finely dissected leaves. \nThe number of traps on each leaf can be very high, but is variable, with leaf size, trap \nsize and the density of traps all being plastic characters (Friday, 1992). Each bladder \nis capped by a small \u201ctrapdoor\u201d, which is closed when the trap is primed and the ions \npumped actively from within the bladder, causing water to leave, such that the walls \nof the bladder are flattened and under pressure (Sydenham & Findlay, 1975). The trap \nis activated when an animal disturbs the trigger bristles around the mouth of the trap, \nthe trapdoor opens and the animal is sucked into the bladder as the walls revert to \ntheir rounded shape. Enzymes, glucosidases, aminidases and phosphatases are \nreleased from glands in the bladder wall and digest the prey (Sirov\u00e1, Adamec & Vrba, \n2003). \n 4\n Utricularia vulgaris plants are rootless and, other than the traps, have no \nspecialised organs for the uptake of nutrients from the surrounding water. In this \nspecies, therefore, there are two routes by which nutrients can be taken up:  \n1 \n2 \n3 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \na) by the capture and breakdown of prey in traps, and 4 \nb) by the absorption of dissolved nutrients from the aquatic medium over the entire 5 \nshoot surface (Friday, 1992). 6 \nAs the production of traps by the plant is plastic, and there is no cost involved in \nthe production of roots to obtain nutrients from the medium, U. vulgaris should be an \nideal species to test the impact of increasing nutrients on investment in carnivory. \nHowever, previous attempts to use Utricularia species to assess the investment in \ncarnivory have been unsuccessful due to the use of poor measures of relative \ninvestment (e.g. Knight, 1992, see Friday, 1991), or poorly controlled experiments \n(Knight & Frost, 1991). Nevertheless, it has been suggested that the investment in \ntraps varies in response to season (Friday, 1992), prey density (Guisande et al., 2000), \nperiphyton density and nutrient availability (Knight & Frost, 1991). There are further \ncomplications in that the growth of the plants, and leaf size in particular, also appears \nto be affected by several of these factors (Kosiba, 1992a; Kosiba, 1992b), highlighting \nthe importance of using relative measures of investment in carnivory rather than total \ninvestment per leaf (e.g. Knight, 1992; Guisande et al., 2004). \nOur aim was to quantify the effects of increasing nutrient availability on the \ninvestment in carnivory of U. vulgaris under controlled conditions using appropriate \nmeasures of relative investment in trap production. We tested the hypothesis that the \nrelative investment of biomass in traps is negatively influenced by the availability of \nlimiting nutrients available from non-carnivorous sources. We did not attempt to \ninvestigate the influence of prey availability or nutritional quality on relative \n 5\n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \ninvestment of biomass in traps, but it is possible that these factors may have an \ninfluence also. \n \nMethods \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \nSite Description \nUtricularia vulgaris plants were collected from Wicken Fen National Nature \nReserve, Cambridgeshire, UK (52 18\u2019 N 0 17\u2019 E), and transported to the laboratory in \nwater. Wicken Fen is a calcareous lowland fen exceptionally rich in vascular plants \nwith over 400 species present. Additional water was also collected for use as a growth \nmedium and for the estimation of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations using a \nSkalar San++ autoanalyser (Breda, The Netherlands). \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nExperimental Design \nOn return to the laboratory, plants were cut to a standard length of 10 cm from \nthe growing point (comprising approximately 25 expanded nodes). Only unbranched \nshoots were used; any shoots with developed side branches less than 10 cm from the \ngrowing point were discarded. Each plant was then placed in a plastic bucket (20 cm \ndiameter) containing 1L of unfiltered Wicken Fen water. The water was well mixed \nprior to use, in order to keep prey density similar between the all replicates. \nThe plants were incubated for 5 weeks (4th May to 8th June, 2004) under \ncontrolled temperature (12 \u00b11\u00b0 C) and light conditions (130 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 PAR at plant \nsurface) on a 16 hour light: 8 hour dark cycle. Additions of nitrogen, as ammonium \nnitrate (NH4NO3), and phosphorus, as sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate (NaH2PO4), \nwere added weekly to buckets at one of three loadings in a fully crossed design: \nPhosphorus  \ni) 0 \u03bcg P L-1 (0 \u03bcM),  25 \n 6\n ii) 25 \u03bcg P L-1 (0.78 \u03bcM),  1 \niii) 50 \u03bcg P L-1 (1.56 \u03bcM)  2 \n3 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nand nitrogen  \ni) 0 \u03bcg N L-1 (0 \u03bcM),  4 \nii) 400 \u03bcg N L-1 (28.6 \u03bcM), 5 \niii) 800 \u03bcg N L-1 (56.1 \u03bcM)  6 \nEach of the nine treatments was replicated five times arranged within five blocks. Any \nwater loss due to evaporation was replaced with deionised water. \nThe investment in carnivory was assessed at the start of the experiment, prior to \nany nutrient addition, and at the end of the five week growing period, using two \nmethods. \na) The proportion of the leaf area comprising traps (assessed using image analysis). 12 \nThis measure of the investment in carnivory takes into account both the number \nand the size of individual traps, relative to the size of the leaf. Large traps are \nmore effective than small (Friday 1991), but encounter rate with prey is a function \nof the number of traps (Harms 2002). \nb) The proportion of the leaf dry mass comprising traps. This measure of the 17 \ninvestment in carnivory takes into account the amount of matter used to construct \nthe traps, relative to that used to construct the leaf. There is not a direct \nrelationship between this measure of investment and investment measured as area, \nbecause large traps have a higher mass per unit area than small traps (Friday, \n1991).  \nAlthough the proportion of biomass comprising traps is the most useful measure of a \nplant\u2019s investment in carnivory, the way in which the biomass is partitioned among a \n 7\n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nvariable number of traps of different sizes may also be important (Friday, 1992). \nHence, both methods were used. \n \na) Image analysis  \nA single leaf attached to the shoot 3 cm from the growing point was carefully \nremoved from the stem of each plant using forceps and a scalpel. Each leaf was then \nplaced individually into a glass Petri-dish, using a paintbrush and needle to ensure that \nthe leaf and traps were spread out and did not overlap. A computerised image of each \nleaf was produced and analysed using Optimas 6.5 software to calculate surface area. \nOnce the image had been produced all the traps were carefully removed and the \nprocess repeated. The percentage of the leaf surface area that comprised traps was \nthen calculated by the difference between the two images.  \n \nb) Dry weight \nAfter the leaves had been used for image analysis, the dry mass of the leaves \nand traps were determined separately after drying at 70 \u00b0C to constant mass.  \n \nOnly one leaf was sampled as bladders are only active for a short time after \nleaf expansion (Friday, 1989). We chose this position as this was within the region of \nthe stem where 100% of the bladders are active. Once the leaves are more than 10 \ndays old the bladders stop being active and start to break down. After 21 days, >90% \nof the bladders are missing (Friday, 1989). An additional advantage of using young \nleaves is that they are generally clear of periphyton, thus improving the accuracy of \nmeasurements. \n 8\n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \nAt the end of the five-week growth period the plants were harvested and the \ninvestment in carnivory assessed as at the start. To estimate plant growth, the length \nof the main axis of each plant was measured and the dry mass of the plants measured \nafter the removal of periphyton. Periphyton was removed from each plant by vigorous \nshaking it for 1.5 minutes in a sealed vessel containing 150ml of tap water, sufficient \nto remove nearly all attached algae (Zimba & Hopson, 1997; Jones et al., 2000). The \nplant, and any fragments, was removed from the algal suspension and dried at 70\u00b0C to \nconstant mass. One 50ml aliquot of the resultant suspension was passed through a pre-\nweighed Whatman GF\/C filter. The filter was checked for any plant fragments, which \nwere removed with forceps, and dried at 70\u00b0C to constant mass to estimate total mass \nof matter, including all live and dead organic matter and inorganic material. Another \n50 ml aliquot of the periphyton suspension was passed through a second Whatman \nGF\/C filter in a similar manner, and chlorophyll-a determined after cold extraction in \n90% acetone. In order to make valid comparisons between plants of differing size, \nmeasures of periphyton were standardized to per unit area of plant surface, calculated \nfrom known surface area: dry mass relationships (following Jones et al., 2000). \n \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nPublished data \nThe data given in Kosiba (1992a & b) were used to assess the effect of varying \nnutrient conditions across sites in the field. The data were collected from various sites \nin Poland in 1983. Leaves varied in size among the sites. As area varies in proportion \nto the square of length, the number of traps per unit leaf length squared was used as a \nmeasure of investment in carnivory to correct for variations in leaf size. Kosiba \n(1992a & b) also include data on the elemental composition of the plants (N, P, K, Ca, \nMg, Na, Fe, S) and the water chemistry parameters measured at the sites (pH, PO43- \n 9\n (orthophosphate), NO3-, NH4+, K+, Ca+, Mg2+, Na+, Fe3+, SO42-, Cl-, total hardness, \ntotal organic carbon and humic acid concentration). A further chemical variable, the \natomic N:P in the water at each site, was calculated from these data to determine if the \nrelative availability of nutrients was important. Both sets of data, water chemistry \nvariables and plant elemental composition, were used to determine the effect on \ninvestment in carnivory. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \nStatistics \nA general linear model two-way analysis of variance (GLM ANOVA) was \nused to test for differences between nutrient treatments using MINITAB. Data on the \nproportion of leaf comprising traps, determined both by image analysis and by dry \nweight, were transformed using arcsin transformation before use. The relationship \nbetween investment in carnivory and water chemistry variables in the Polish data set \nwas analysed using stepwise regression (SAS). \n \nResults \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \nWater \nThe water from Wicken Fen contained 58 \u00b5gl-1 (3.4 \u00b5M) ammonium, 3.6 \u00b5gl-1 \n(0.06 \u00b5M) nitrate, 1.8 \u00b5gl-1 (0.04\u00b5M) nitrite and 1.2 \u00b5gl-1 (0.01 \u00b5M) soluble reactive \nphosphate.  \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nGrowth \nAll plants grew during the five week incubation period, with a mean length of \nthe main axis of 30.88 cm (cf. 10 cm at start).  However, there was no effect of \nnitrogen loading on the growth of the plants (p = 0.75), and the influence of \nphosphorus was also (though only marginally) insignificant (p = 0.08; Fig. 1). This \nmay have been due to the growth period being of insufficient time for significant \n 10\n 1 \n2 \ndifferences to develop between the treatments. Similar results were found for final dry \nmass. \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \nPeriphyton \nThe mean density of periphyton, as dry mass per unit plant surface area, \nranged from 0.017 mg cm-2 to 0.022 mg cm-2 and, as chlorophyll-a per unit plant \nsurface area, from 0.0052 \u03bcg chla cm-2 to 0.0102 \u03bcg chla cm-2. However, the amount \nof periphyton growing on the plants was not significantly affected by phosphorus, \nnitrogen or by the interaction between phosphorus and nitrogen, using either measure \n(Fig. 2). \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nInvestment in Carnivory  \nAlthough variable among plants, the percentage of the total surface area of the \nleaf that comprised traps was not significantly different among the treatments at the \nstart of the experiment (Fig. 3a). Neither was there any difference among treatments \nin the percentage of the leaf mass that comprised traps (Fig. 4a). Therefore, there was \nno difference in investment in carnivory between treatments before the nutrient \nmanipulation began.  \nIn contrast, after five weeks incubation the percentage of the total surface area \ncomprising traps was significantly lower in those plants that had been exposed to \nhigher phosphorus loading (Fig. 3b, p = 0.007). However, there was no significant \neffect of nitrogen, or of the interaction between phosphorus and nitrogen (Fig. 3b). \nThe same result was found when investment in carnivory was estimated as the \nproportion of the leaf mass comprising traps (Fig. 4b). It is possible that the observed \nexperimental effect of phosphorus on investment in carnivory was indirect, via \nchanges in the quantity or quality of prey. Nevertheless, it is clear that the availability \n 11\n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \nof phosphorus in the water has a significant impact, either direct or indirect, upon the \ninvestment in carnivory of U. vulgaris. \nOver the five weeks incubation the percentage of the total surface area that \ncomprised traps declined overall (p = 0.0001), but the percentage of the leaf mass that \ncomprised traps did not (p = 0.11). The difference in response between these two \nmeasures of investment is due to an increase in average trap size; small traps have a \nlower mass per unit area than large traps (Friday, 1991). Distribution of the same \nmass among a smaller number of large traps will result in a reduced encounter rate \nwith prey, which may reflect an increased prey density in all experimental treatments \nrelative to the field. \n \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nPublished data \nThe biomass of U. vulgaris increased with increasing phosphorus \nconcentration in the surrounding water (Fig. 5a), as noted by (Kosiba, 1992a). \nAlthough there was no relationship between biomass of U. vulgaris and nitrogen \nconcentration (either as ammonium, nitrate or both), high biomass was not achieved at \nhigh nitrogen concentrations. It was also apparent that leaf size increased with \nincreasing phosphorus concentration (Fig. 5b), which had an influence on the number \nof traps per leaf (Fig. 5c). Hence, the number of traps per unit leaf length squared was \nused as a measure of relative investment, to take into account variations in leaf size. \nThere was no relationship between the investment in carnivory and the concentration \nof nitrogen in the water, either as nitrate, ammonium, or total nitrogen (Fig. 5d). Of \nthe water chemistry variables, the best predictor of relative investment in carnivory \nwas phosphorus concentration in the surrounding water, although its effect was \nmarginally insignificant (Fig. 5e). The poor correlation between measured \n 12\n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \northophosphate and investment in carnivory may reflect the difficulties of estimating \nphosphorus availability with this measure (a small and rapidly recycled portion of the \ntotal phosphorus pool). When plant elemental composition was included, the best \npredictor of relative investment was phosphorus content (Fig. 5f). Again there was a \ndecline in relative investment with increasing phosphorus content, but the relationship \nwas highly significant using this measure of phosphorus availability (Fig. 5f). \n \nDiscussion \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nPlant Growth \nIt is generally assumed that carnivory enhances the supply of nutrients in \nhabitats where growth is severely restricted by their supply. In this experiment, \nhowever, increased availability of phosphorus or nitrogen in the water surrounding the \nUtricularia plants did not affect their growth. Nevertheless, the field data of Kosiba \n(1992a) show a strong relationship between phosphorus and growth. Other workers \nhave suggested that the growth of Utricularia is better explained by prey density \n(Englund & Harms, 2003), but this seems highly unlikely unless nutrient acquisition \nis solely via carnivory.  \nIt is possible that growth of the Utricularia plants was restricted by some other \nfactor, with the most likely explanation being that the density of periphyton (Jones & \nSayer, 2003). However, there was no relationship between periphyton, either as dry \nweight or chlorophyll per unit plant surface area, and plant growth. Also, the amount \nof periphyton was not significantly affected by the addition of P, N or the interaction \nbetween P and N. These findings suggest that in this experiment, the periphyton was \nnot responsible for the lack of a relationship between nutrient addition and the growth \nof Utricularia. This is contrary to the theory proposed by Phillips et al. (1978) who \n 13\n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \nsuggested that periphyton biomass is related to nutrient concentration. Laboratory \nexperiments under controlled conditions have also shown an increase in periphyton \nwith nutrients (for example, Jones et al., 2000) and there is a well described negative \ninteraction between periphyton and plants (Jones et al., 1999; Jones & Sayer, 2003). \nHowever, there is also evidence that the main constraint on periphyton biomass is the \ngrazing action of invertebrates (Cattaneo, 1983; Kairesalo & Koskimies, 1987; Jones, \nMoss & Young, 1998; Jones & Sayer, 2003) and it is likely that the prey, chydorids \nand ostracods, were feeding upon the periphytic algae. \nMost importantly, the lack of a significant effect of the added nutrients on the \ngrowth of the plants and periphyton, and a lack of a significant effect of periphyton on \nplant growth, removes the influence of these confounding variables on the \nrelationship between nutrient availability and investment in carnivory. The test of this \nrelationship was the prime objective of this work.  \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nInvestment in Carnivory \nAt the start of the experiment the proportion of leaf biomass represented by \ntraps was not significantly different among the treatments, measured using either \nimage analysis or dry weight. There was variation among the plants, but this was \nexpected as the proportion of biomass invested in traps can vary widely within \npopulations of U. vulgaris (Friday, 1992), presumably as each individual plant \nexperiences different conditions dependent upon microhabitat.  \nBy the end of the growth period, however, there was a significant relationship \nbetween phosphorus addition and the investment in carnivory, measured both as \nsurface area and dry mass. Both the image analysis and the dry weight measurements \nshowed that the proportion of the leaf dedicated to carnivory declined with increasing \navailability of phosphorus in the surrounding medium, but was not influenced by \n 14\n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nnitrogen additions or by the interaction between phosphorus and nitrogen. This is \nsomewhat surprising as it is commonly assumed that nitrogen is the nutrient \u201csought \nafter\u201d by carnivorous plants. However, the concentration of nitrogen in the water at \nWicken Fen, from where the plants were collected and was used as the growth \nmedium during the experiment, was far greater than that of phosphorus. Assuming \nthat only ammonium was used by the plants, as it is energetically favoured, there was \n260-fold more N than P (3.4\u00b5M NH3 cf. 0.013 \u00b5M P04-) in the water at Wicken Fen. \nThe habitats where the plants and water were collected were typical of the stagnant \npools in this peaty fen. The conditions of low oxygen would tend to encourage \nmineralization and the production of ammonia, a characteristic common to many of \nthe sites where U. vulgaris grows (Kosiba, 1992a). Utricularia vulgaris cannot make \ndirect use of the sediment pool of phosphate, which is the principle source for rooted \nmacrophytes, suggesting that, at the start of the experiment the plants depended on \nprey as virtually the sole source of phosphorus. Friday & Quarmby (1994) found this \nto be the case in their investigation of U. vulgaris growing at Wicken Fen.  \nThe relative importance of nitrogen and phosphorus for carnivorous plants has \nbeen debated for some time (Lollar et al., 1971; Heslop-Harrison, 1978), and it would \nseem reasonable that under conditions of nutrient limitation, carnivory could provide \na route for the supply of whatever nutrient was limiting growth. Although U. vulgaris \ngrows in waters over a range of nitrogen and phosphorus conditions (Knight & Frost, \n1991; Friday, 1992), both the laboratory experiment and the data of Kosiba (1992a & \nb) show that investment in carnivory in U. vulgaris was inversely correlated to \nphosphorus availability, and particularly the amount of phosphorus acquired by the \nplants. The availability of nitrogen in the medium or acquired by the plant, both as \nabsolute concentration or relative to phosphorus, had little influence on either the \n 15\n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \ngrowth of the plants or the investment in carnivory. Furthermore, it is apparent that \ngrowth and flowering are directly related to the availability of phosphorus (Kosiba, \n1992a). Many carnivorous plants release phosphatases to digest their prey and, in \nUtricularia at least, they appear to be more important than other enzymes (Sirov\u00e1 et \nal., 2003). Phosphorus uptake via carnivory has been identified using radioisotopes \n(Lollar et al., 1971). Phosphorus often limits the growth of phytoplankton in \nfreshwaters, and the influence of phosphorus on carnivory may reflect the aquatic \nhabit of U. vulgaris. However, these findings may be more applicable to all \ncarnivorous plants, as phosphorus limitation has been linked to the occurrence of \ncarnivory in the terrestrial cobra lily Darlingtonia californica Torr. (Ellison & \nFarnsworth, 2005).  \nThe findings here support the assumption that increasing availability of \nnutrients from external sources leads to a reduction in the investment in carnivory \n(Givnish et al., 1984). As U. vulgaris does not have any specialised organs for the \nuptake of nutrients from the surrounding water, there are no costs involved in the \nproduction of roots to obtain nutrients from the medium, and the reduction in the \nproportion of the leaves that comprise traps is a reduction in investment in carnivory \nin terms of reduced commitment of biomass. What is somewhat surprising is that they \nindicate that phosphorus is the element sought after by this species of carnivorous \nplant, not nitrogen as is commonly assumed.  \n \nAcknowledgments \n We are grateful to the National Trust for allowing us access to Wicken Fen \nNational Nature Reserve.
