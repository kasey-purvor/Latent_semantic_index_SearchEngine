MARTIN LINDSAY AND KALYAN B. SINHA\nAbstract. A Trotter product formula is established for unitary\nquantum stochastic processes governed by quantum stochastic dif-\nferential equations with constant bounded coefficients.\nIntroduction\nThe aim of this paper is to establish a quantum probabilistic coun-\nterpart to the well-known Trotter product formula for one-parameter\nunitary groups and contraction semigroups ([Tro]) and its forerunner,\nthe Lie product formula for one-parameter subgroups of Lie groups\n(see [Dav], [RS1,2]. Some years ago K.R. Parthasarathy and the second-\nnamed author obtained a stochastic Trotter product formula for unitary-\noperator valued evolutions constituted from independent increments\nof independent classical Brownian motions ([PS1]). This predated the\nfounding of quantum stochastic calculus by Hudson and Parthasarathy\n([HuP]). In this paper Brownian increments are replaced by the fun-\ndamental quantum martingales, namely the creation, preservation and\nannihilation processes of quantum stochastic calculus ([Bia], [Hud], [L],\n[Mey], [Par], [SiG]), and we prove a Lie-Trotter type product formula\nfor unitary quantum stochastic processes on a Hilbert space which sat-\nisfy a quantum stochastic differential equation with constant bounded\ncoefficients. The case of quantum stochastic differential equations with\nunbounded coefficients, and more general kinds of quantum stochastic\ncocycle on operator spaces and C\u2217-algebras, will be addressed in the\nforthcoming paper [LS2].\n1. Unitary quantum stochastic cocycles\nIn this section we fix our notations and recall the essential facts\nabout quantum stochastic differential equations and unitary quantum\nstochastic cocycles that we need here.\nLet k be a complex Hilbert space, with fixed countable orthonormal\nbasis, which we refer to as the noise dimension space.

For f \u2208 K, f[s,t[ denotes the function equal to f on [s, t[\nand zero elsewhere; c[s,t[ is defined similarly, for c \u2208 k. Let Sk and S\u2032k\ndenote the subspaces of K consisting of step functions, respectively step\nfunctions which have their discontinuities in the dyadic set D := {j2\u2212n :\nj, n \u2208 Z+}, and let Ek and E \u2032k be the (dense) subspaces Lin{\u03b5(f) : f \u2208\nSk} and Lin{\u03b5(f) : f \u2208 S\u2032k} of Fk. For evaluation purposes, we always\ntake the right-continuous versions of step functions. The order of a\nfunction f \u2208 S\u2032k is the least nonnegative integer N such that f is\nconstant on all intervals of the form [j2\u2212N , (j + 1)2\u2212N [ for j \u2208 Z+.\nThe time-shift semigroup (\u0398kt )t\u22650 of unital *-monomorphisms ofB(Fk)\nis defined by\n\u0398kt (X) = IFk,[0,t[ \u2297 \u0393(\u03b8kt )X\u0393(\u03b8kt )\u2217, t \u2208 R+, X \u2208 B(Fk),\nwhere \u0393(\u03b8kt ) : Fk \u2192 Fk,[t,\u221e[ is the unitary (second quantisation) opera-\ntor determined by\n\u0393(\u03b8kt )$(f) = $(\u03b8\nk\nt f) where (\u03b8\nk\nt f)(s) = f(s\u2212 t) for s \u2208 [t,\u221e[.\nLet {\u039b\u00b5\u03bd : \u00b5, \u03bd \u2265 0} denote the fundamental quantum semimartin-\ngales for the noise dimension space k, with respect to its fixed orthonor-\nmal basis.

Let (Ut)t\u22650 be a unitary quantum stochastic\nprocess on h with noise dimension space k. Then the following are\nequivalent:\n(i) (Ut)t\u22650 satisfies (1.2), for a matrix of bounded operators [F \u00b5\u03bd ];\n(ii) (Ut)t\u22650 is a Markov-regular quantum stochastic cocycle.\nThe implication (i) \u21d2 (ii) follows from the form that solutions of\nsuch QS differential equations take, by virtue of the time-homogeneity\nof the quantum noises:\nIFk,[0,t[ \u2297 \u0393(\u03b8kt )\u039b\u00b5\u03bd [a, b]\u0393(\u03b8kt )\u2217 = \u039b\u00b5\u03bd [a+ t, b+ t],\nand the time-independence of the coefficients of the QS differential\nequation.\nThe converse implication (ii) \u21d2 (i) may be deduced from the Quan-\ntum Martingale Representation Theorem ([PS2]) applied to the regular\nquantum martingale (\nUt \u2212\n\u222b t\n0\nUsK ds\n)\nt\u22650\nin which the operator K is the generator of the expectation semigroup\nof (Ut)t\u22650 (see [HuL]). However the more powerful method of proof\n4 J. MARTIN LINDSAY AND KALYAN B. SINHA\nin [LW1] goes via the following intermediate characterisation which is\nof considerable use itself, as we shall see below:\n(iii) there are semigroups {(P c,d)t\u22650 : c, d \u2208 k} such that, for all\nf, g \u2208 S\u2032k and t \u2208 R+,\n\u3008u\u2297$(f[0,t[), Vt v\u2297$(g[0,t[)\u3009 =\n\u3008u, P f(t0),g(t0)t1\u2212t0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 P f(tm),g(tm)tm+1\u2212tm v\u3009,\n(1.5)\nwhere t0 = 0, tm+1 = t and {t1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < tm} \u2282 D is the (possibly\nempty) union of the sets of discontinuity of f and g in the open\ninterval ]0, t[.\nRemarks. The matrix of bounded operators [F \u00b5\u03bd ] necessarily satisfies\nthe structural relations required for unitarity (1.3).\nThe identity (1.5) is known as the semigroup decomposition and the\ncollection {(P c,dt )t\u22650 : c, d \u2208 k} as the associated semigroups of the\ncocycle. Clearly the associated semigroups are determined by\n\u3008u, P c,dt v\u3009 = \u3008u\u2297$(c[0,t[), Ut v \u2297$(d[0,t[)\u3009, u, v \u2208 h, (1.6)\nand (P 0,0)t\u22650 is the expectation semigroup of the cocycle.\nIn fact, each associated semigroup (P c,d)t\u22650 is itself the expectation\nsemigroup of another unitary QS cocycle, namely the cocycle(\nU c,dt := (Ih \u2297W ct )\u2217 Ut(Ih \u2297W dt )\n)\nt\u22650\n,\nwhere the Weyl cocycles are defined by\nW ct$(f) = e\n\u2212i Im\u3008c[0,t[,f\u3009$(f + c[0,t[), f \u2208 Sk, c \u2208 k, t \u2208 R+.\nMarkov-regularity for a QS contraction cocycle actually implies that\nall of its associated semigroups are norm-continuous. In fact, in terms\nof the block matrix form of [F \u00b5\u03bd ], the semigroup (P\nc,d)t\u22650 has bounded\ngenerator\nGc,d := K + L\nc +Md +W\nc\nd \u2212 12(\u2016c\u20162 + \u2016d\u20162)Ih, (1.7)\nwhere, in terms of basis expansions of c and d, the operators here are\ndefined as follows:\nLc =\n\u2211\nj\u22651\ncjLj, Md =\n\u2211\nk\u22651\ndkMk and W\nc\nd =\n\u2211\nj,k\u22651\ncjdkW jk ,\nthe convergence here being in the strong operator topology (see [LW2]).\nGiven a unitary QS cocycle (Ut)t\u22650, the family (Us,t := \u0398s(U(t\u2212s)))0\u2264s\u2264t\nis a time-homogeneous adapted unitary evolution, that is: for all a \u2265 0\nand 0 \u2264 r \u2264 s \u2264 t:\n(i) Us+a,t+a = \u0398a(Us,t);\n(ii) Us,t \u2208 B(h)\u2297 IFk,[0,t[\u2297B(Fk,[s,t[)\u2297 IFk,[t,\u221e[ ;\n(iii) Ur,t = Ur,s Us,t.\nQUANTUM STOCHASTIC LIE-TROTTER PRODUCT FORMULA 5\nConversely, if (Us,t)0\u2264s\u2264t is such an evolution then (Ut := U0,t)t\u22650\ndefines a unitary QS cocycle, and it is easily seen that the passages\nbetween QS cocycle and adapted time-homogeneous evolution are mu-\ntually inverse.\nThe corresponding QS integral equation satisfied by (Us,t)0\u2264s\u2264t is\nUr,t = Ih\u2297Fk +\n\u222b t\nr\nUr,sF\n\u00b5\n\u03bd \u039b\n\u03bd\n\u00b5(ds).\nAdapted evolutions that are not time-homogeneous arise as solutions\nof QS differential equations with time-dependent coefficients [F \u00b5\u03bd ].\n2. Trotter product of quantum stochastic cocycles\nLet (U1t )t\u22650 and (U\n2\nt )t\u22650 be two unitary QS cocycles on the same\ninitial space h, with noise dimension spaces k1 and k2 having fixed\ncountable orthonormal bases.

Concluding remarks\nThe methods of this paper extend to more general QS cocycles.\nFirstly, quantum stochastic Trotter product formulae may be obtained\nfor completely contractive QS cocycles on operators spaces and com-\npletely positive QS cocycles on C\u2217-algebras. Secondly, strongly con-\ntinuous (as opposed to Markov-regular) QS cocycles may be shown to\nsatisfy the QS Trotter product formula developed here. Conversely, the\nformula may be used to construct QS cocycles from simpler cocycles\nwith lower dimensional noises. This yields potential applications to\nmultidimensional diffusions. The basic conditions under which Trotter\nproducts converge is that the sum of sufficiently many pairs of associ-\nated semigroup generators are pregenerators of contraction semigroups.\nHere the assumption of analyticity of the expectation semigroups of\nthe constituent cocycles helps ([LS1]). As in the Markov-regular case,\nstrong (as opposed to weak) operator convergence holds for Trotter\nproducts of isometric QS cocycles if and only if the limiting cocycle\nis isometric. Coisometry, on the other hand, is equivalent to isometry\nof the dual cocycle (see [L]). Unitarity for strongly continuous con-\ntraction cocycles is assured when the cocycle satisfies a QS differential\ndifferential whose coefficients satisfy Feller conditions (see [SiG]).\nAll these extensions are treated in [LS2]. They are facilitated by\ncharacterisations of QS cocycles in terms of (a small number of) their\nassociated semigroups ([AcK], [LW3]). Here Skeide\u2019s multidimensional\ngeneralisation ([Ske]) of a theorem of Parthasarathy and Sunder ([PSu])\nplays a key role. The homomorphic property of Trotter product limits\nof Evans-Hudson type cocycles on operator algebras is tackled in [DGS].\nQUANTUM STOCHASTIC LIE-TROTTER PRODUCT FORMULA 11\nAcknowledgements\nBoth authors acknowledge support from the UK-India Education\nand Research Initiative (UKIERI).
