Not the model fits to express the geometric \nshape and thematic characters of geological entity efficiently, \nbut also the data structure describing the geometric shape and \nthematic character of 3D entity used in the model can be \noperated in the computer easily. Therefore, rational and \nefficient geoinformation model is the precondition of \nprocessing and showing of geoinformation[ 11. \n3D vector model is an only model describing 3D entity in \nthe microcomputer environment. Many commissions, learned \npersons and wise men broke their heads and hurt their brains \nfor many years on this problem of definitions of 3D entities or \nfeatures and their thematic and geometric descriptions. \nMolenaar[2], Dr. Li[3] and others proposed the conceptual \nmodel of 3D vector GIS and failed to implement it \npracticably. The paper introduces 3D vector topology model \nin the Visualization System; first, to confirm entity characters \nin the System based on the information characters of three- \ndimensional entity in the world. Second, to study and define \nthe 3D entity using the object-oriented approach, and to draw \nthe conclusion--there is only polyhedron geometric type in the \n3D vector topological model. Furthermore, it is discussed \nhow to build 3D vector topology model in the Visualization \nSystem. Third, to present what constitute a polyhedron, which \nrelationships exist among the geometric elements, and how to \nrepresent the 3D geometric elements in the Visualization \nsystem using an example. \nINFORMATIONCHARACTERS OF 3D \nGEOLOGICAL ENTITY \nThe district geological entity is composed of a series of \nsub-geological entities, which have different attributes (Fig \n1). Each 3D geological entity has four information characters \nin the nature: thematic character, spatial position character, \nspatial relational character and time character. \nThematic Character: describing the phenomenal or \ncharacter of geological entity, i.e. the age of geological \nentity, the thematic character of geological entity. It is \ndisplayed by the graphics symbol or the color in the \ngraphics, is represented by a group of numbers or \ncharacters in the computer. \nSpatial Position Character: the entity is displayed \nabstractly by one of 3D geometric objects -- point, line \nand face or polyhedron (body), in the graphics; it is \ndescribed by a serial of (x, y, z) coordinates in the \ncomputer according to the graphics characters of point, \nline, face or body. \nSpatial Relation Character: describing the relation of \nspatial neighboring and containing among sub-entities. \nThe spatial relation of sub-entity is identified by the \ndifference of graphics or colors in the graphics, and \ndefined by the topological structure among the spatial \ndata in the computer. \nTime Character: the changing character of entity \naccording to time. \nA g B \nFigure 1 Region Geological Entity \n0-7803-6359-01001$10.00  2000 IEEE 3000 \nOBJECT-ORIENTED DESCRIPTION OF 3D \nGEOLOGICAL ENTITY \n3D geological entity is a collection of a series of thematic \n(physical, chimerical) and relations in the geological domain. \nThe steps of object-oriented description of 3D geological \nentity are first, to determine the class and thematic character \nof geological entity based on the aim of research and \napplication. After the thematic characters of different entities \nare determined, only the thematic characters closing with the \naim of research and application are kept, otherwise must be \ndiscarded, so that geological object has a closely connection \nwith a series of characters, and the thematic and spatial \nanalysis can be finished easily. For example, in order to \nanalyze the region geological structure, we divide the region \ngeological entity into C, P, T, F and B sub-geological entities \nbased on the age and thematic characters, Fig. 1. Second, to \ndefine 3D spatial geometric model of the object. Based on the \n3D spatial geometric shape, the 3D object can be divided into \npoint, line, face and body four different geometric object \nclasses. Each object class is consisted of lots of points, lines, \nand faces geometric elements (Fig. 1). The spatial position \ncharacter of the entity can be determined by the (x, y, z) \ncoordinates of the geometric elements. The spatial relational \ncharacters among the entities are described by the topological \ncharacters among the geometric elements of the geometric \nclass objects. \nConsequently, the following steps must be done in order to \nbuild 3D vector topological model: first, to determine the \nclass and thematic character of geological entity based on the \naim of research and application. Second, to define 3D \ngeometric characters of the entities. That is, defining the \ngeometric classes of the geological entity, confirming which \npoints, lines, and faces consist of the geometric class, and the \n3D topological relations among the geometric elements. \n3D VECTOR TOPOLOGYCAL GEOLOGICAL \nMODEL \nPolyhedron Object \nSupposed researching the region geological structure, we \ndivide the region geological entity into C, P, T, F and B sub- \ngeological entities based on the age and thematic characters, \nFig.1. Each sub-entity is a different thematic object in the 3D, \nand defined by one or more enclosing directional surfaces, the \ncoordinates in the surfaces determins the shape and position \nof each sub-entity. \nGeometrical Character of Polyhedron Entity \nIn the conceptual model of 3D vector GIS, 3D entity in the \nnature is regarded as one of the point, line, face and body four \nbasic spatial object classes abstractly [2, 31. But in the 3D \nvector topological model, there is only polyhedron class; each \npolyhedron entity has both thematic and geometric characters. \nPoint object is abstractly belonged to polyhedron class, its \nvolume and out-surface area equal to zero. The point object \nenclosed in out-surface and having the thematic of enclosed \nthematic can be discarded. Line object cannot be existed in \nthe geological domain. Face object, i.e. fault, disconnection, \nalso is regarded as the body object having the characters of \nzero-volume, some zero-area faces and some zero-length \nlines. So, point, line, face and body four basic spatial objects \nare abstractly regarded as polyhedron geometrical object in \nthe paper. That is, there is only one geometrical object class \nin the 3D vector topological model -- polyhedron (body) \ngeometrical class [4]. \nGeometrical Element of Polyhedron Entity \nAll of 3D entities in the geoinformation visualization \nsystem must be data that can be stored in the computer. In \nFig. 1, the region geological entity is enclosed by six out- \nsections, one or more directional enclosed faces define the \nspatial boundary of each sub-entities. Each out-section is \ncomposed of lots of faces having different characters, and its \nboundary is defined by a lot of arris. For each surface, the \nboundary is determined by one or more directional enclosed \ncurves, the form and position are defined by the point- \ncoordinates lying on the surface and the boundary, the \nthematic is defined by the point\u2019s thematic. The boundary of \nthe face (surface, out-section, inter-section) is defined by an \nout-circle. The circle is an enclosed boundary which is \ncomposed by a series of sequence and directional edges or \narris, the out-circle defines the maximum boundary of face. \nThe form of face is controlled by control-points and can be \nrepresented by arcs or circles. The neighboring surfaces of \npolyhedron object (included sub-body) cross on the edge or \narris, the surface of body contains lots of arcs. A starting node \nand an ending node controls the direction of these edges and \narris, the form of edge or arris is controlled by lots of control \npoints and defined by lots of interpolation points. \nTherefore, the region entity is divided into series sub- \nentities according to the research\u2019s aim. Each sub-entity is \nenclosed by lots of surfaces, and its spatial shape is \npolyhedron. Each face\u2019s boundary is defined by lots of edges \nor arris, each edge or arris contains at least two nodes. Each \nnode connects more than two edges or arris. The relationship \nbetween body object and the geometric elements of point, line \nand face is a multi-hierarchic network in the 3D vector \ntopological model. \nTopological Relationship Among Geometrical Elements \nA polyhedron object is defined by lots of point, line, and \nface geometrical elements. And, there are two important \ninformation among the geometrical elements of polyhedron: \none is geometrical information, it depicts the character and \nmeasurement of geometrical elements, i.e. position, size. \nAnother is connective relation among geometrical elements, \nwhich is topological information. It represents that which \nfaces define the polyhedron, which circle encloses the face \nand is composed of which edges and arris, and which nodes \ndefines the edge or arris, and so on. Concerning multi-factors, \n3001 \nseven topological relations of geometrical element in the \nVisualization system are confirmed.

Second, to \ndetermine the geometric characters of the geological \nentity, i.e. the geometric class of the entity, the geometric \nclass consists of which points, lines, and faces, and the \n3D topological relations among the geometric elements. \nConcerning the geological domain, the point, line, face, \nand body spatial geometric objects are abstractly \nregarded as body objects. There is only one geometric \nclass--polyhedron in the 3D Vector structure model. \n3D region entity is composed of a series of sub-entities, \neach has both of thematic and geometric characters. Each \nsub-entity is enclosed by a lot of faces. The boundary of \neach face is composed of some edges and arris. Each \nedge and arris contains two nodes. Each node connects \nmore than two edges and arris. The relationship between \nsub-entity and point, line, face is a multi-hierarchic \nnetwork. \nREFERENCE \n[ 11 Martien Molenaar, Object Hierarchies and Uncertainty in \nGIS or why is Standardization so Difficult? 1993, GIS,4 \nVo1.6 \n[2] Martien Molenaar, A Topology for 3D Vector Maps, ITC \nJoumal 1992- 1 \n[3]Qingyuan Li, Study on the topological relation of 3D \nVector GIs, Paper of Ph.D of China University of Mining and \nTechnology, 1996 \n[4] Yan Xia, Study on 3D Vector Topology Geological \nModel and Geoinformatics Visualization System, Paper of \nPh.D of China University of Mining and Technology, 1997 \n3002 \n"}
