Relationship marketing focuses on customers\nand long-term relationship building rather than on products (Christopher,\nPayne and Ballantyne 2003). A major implication of relationship marketing is\nthat marketing decisions should be about optimising the long-term value of the\ncustomer (Berger and Bechwati 2001). Consequently, accounting for\nmarketing has shifted from the traditional product profitability approach (Grant\nand Schlesinger 1995) to a customer profitability focus.\nThe new focus has revealed that customer profitability is principally\ndetermined not by the cost of the products that the customer buys, but by the\ncosts of managing the customer relationship (Kalwani and Narayandas 1995;\nReinartz and Kumar 2002). This is particularly an issue in business-to-\nbusiness markets, in which substantial proportions of sales and marketing\nresources may be allocated to individual customers (Bowman and\nNarayandas 2004). Overspending on customer retention can mean that\nretained customers are not necessarily more profitable (Thomas, Reinartz and\nKumar 2004), and the influence of customer management activities on the\nprofitability of customers is well-attested (Bowman and Narayandas 2004;\nRyals and Knox 2004; Ryals 2005).\nFocusing on the profitable management of customer relationships has also\nhelped to address the calls for greater accountability in marketing (Doyle\n32000), since the value of customers is related to the value of the firm (Gupta,\nLehmann and Stuart 2004). Previous research has found two sources of value\nfrom customers: financial (measured by the profitability or lifetime value of the\ncustomer) and indirect (other value from the relationship that is not directly\nrelated to the financial value of that customer). A review of the literature on\nthe financial value of the customer reveals that mainstream methods for\nvaluing customers do not take indirect value sufficiently into account, despite\nits acknowledged importance. The paper goes on to examine how two\ncompanies have addressed this issue and determined the indirect value of\ntheir customers, and how this information changed their customer\nmanagement strategies.\nCALCULATING THE DIRECT FINANCIAL VALUE OF A CUSTOMER\nThe growing requirement to monitor how investments in customer\nmanagement pay off over time has meant that customer lifetime value and\ncustomer equity approaches to valuing customers have become widely\naccepted (Jain and Singh 2002; Gupta and Lehmann 2003; Ambler and\nRoberts 2005). Customer lifetime value is the value of a customer relationship\nover the course of the relationship lifetime (e.g. Reichheld and Sasser 1990;\nReichheld 1996; Reichheld and Schefter 2000). Customer equity is the total\nlifetime value of a company\u2019s customer base (e.g. Blattberg, Getz and\nThomas 2001; Lemon, Rust and Zeithaml 2001; Rust, Lemon and Zeithaml\n2001).\n4Table 1 sets out a definition of each financial approach, its advantages and\ndisadvantages, and its application to marketing practice.\n- Bring in Table 1 near here -\nTo calculate customer lifetime value, marketers must forecast the likely length\nof the relationship lifetime and then the customer profitability or cash flow\neach year (Ryals and Knox 2004). Customer acquisition costs for an existing\ncustomer are generally disregarded (Berger and Nasr 1998), although they\nmay be included for a new or returning customer (Calciu and Salerno 2002).\nThese future profits are then discounted back to present day monetary\namounts (Jain and Singh 2002). Thus, in accounting terms, calculating\ncustomer lifetime value is about forecasting the net present value of a\ncustomer.\nWhere the lifetime value relates to a number of customers and takes potential\nvalue into account, it is known as customer equity (Blattberg, Getz and\nThomas 2001). \u2018Potential value\u2019 involves forecasting likely additional future\npurchases, increase in share of spend etc. Because of the larger sample\nnumbers, customer equity is amenable to the use of forecasting tools such as\nacquisition \/ retention modelling (Berger and Bechwati 2001), decision\ncalculus, regression analysis, neural networks (Berger and Bechwati 2001),\nDelphi panels (Story, Hurdley, Smith and Saker 2001), or Markov techniques\n(Rust, Lemon and Zeithaml 2001).\n5Applying customer lifetime value \/ customer equity to marketing decision-\nmaking\nMarketing managers are increasingly interested in understanding customer\nlifetime value as a guide to the way they manage customer relationships (EIU\n1998). Lifetime value is affected by the way in which the relationship is\nmanaged but may also be affected by exogenous factors such as the actions\nof competing suppliers or changes in the customer\u2019s own circumstances.\nGenerally, however, customers with high lifetime value will be preferred\ntargets for retention strategies; customers with low or negative lifetime values\nmight be better managed through cheaper channels or via a third party such\nas a distributor, or offered a lower service package (Booz Allen and Hamilton\n2002).\nSince the way in which the customer is managed has a major impact on\nlifetime value (Kalwani and Narayandas 1995; Reinartz and Kumar 2002),\ncalculating customer lifetime value should not be seen as a one-off exercise\nbut as dynamic (Jain and Singh 2002). Resource allocation decisions should\naim to optimise returns on the marketing investment.\nCustomer equity is a portfolio-based measure and is associated with the\nnotion of customers as assets (Blattberg and Deighton 1996; Blattberg, Getz\nand Thomas 2001; Hogan, Lemon and Rust 2002). The marketing\napplications of customer equity relate to budget setting and allocation (Berger\nand Bechwati 2001), balancing customer acquisition and retention activities\n6(Thomas, Reinartz and Kumar 2004) and profitable customer management\n(Zeithaml, Rust and Lemon, 2001).\nWeaknesses of customer lifetime value \/ customer equity tools\nRecent research has revealed three weaknesses that affect both tools \u2013\nforecasting, discounting, and whether the tools really do measure all the value\ngenerated by customers.\nThe first two difficulties have been explored elsewhere. It is known that\nforecasting difficulties have limited the take-up of customer lifetime value by\npractitioners (Gupta and Lehmann 2003). On the discounting issue, some\nmarketers have become concerned that the use of a single discount rate may\nnot reflect the risk in certain customer relationships and have developed\nadditional techniques, either adjusting the discount rate or assessing the\nrelationship risk and thus the probability of future profits (Dhar and Glazer\n2003; Ryals and Knox 2004; Malthouse and Blattberg 2005).\nThe third issue is that these tools do not fully reflect the value of customers to\nthe firm (Hogan, Lemon and Rust 2002; Ambler and Roberts 2005; Haenlein,\nKaplan and Schoder 2006). For example, customer equity calculations do not\nusually include the value of potential customers (those yet to be acquired), yet\nadvocacy from existing customers may help attract them. Even where the\nvalue of potential customers is included in the customer equity calculation\n(Rust, Lemon and Zeithaml 2004), the customers acting as advocates are\n7undervalued. Advocacy, and other indirect sources of value from customers\nnot captured by conventional tools, will now be discussed.\nTHE INDIRECT VALUE OF A CUSTOMER\nThe indirect value of a customer is the additional value (over and above the\ndirect financial value measured by customer lifetime value \/ customer equity)\nthat accrues to the firm through their relationship with that customer. Perhaps\nthe most-explored area is advocacy, or word of mouth, early identified as an\nimportant element of relationship marketing (Christopher, Payne and\nBallantyne 1991) and associated not just with satisfaction but also with\nrelationship duration (e.g. Reichheld 1996). Advocacy has repeatedly been\nshown to have a strong impact on purchasing behaviour (Murray 1991; East\net al. 2005; Keaveney 1995) and can be influenced by marketing strategies\n(East et al. 2005). Consequently, it is positively correlated with company\ngrowth (Reichheld 2003; East et al. 2005; Marsden, Samson and Upton\n2005).\nThe advocacy concept has been extended to include customer reputation or\nreferenceability (Doney and Cannon 1997; Stahl, Matzler and Hinterhuber\n2003). Burnett (1992:12) describes this as \u201cthe kudos of being a supplier to\nHarrods\u201d. Advocacy and referenceability positively impact firm performance by\nreducing customer acquisition costs and by increasing sales through the\nattraction of new customers (Stahl, Matzler and Hinterhuber 2003).\n8Further relational benefits from customer relationships include learning\n(Womack et al. 1990; Wilson 1996; Hope and Hope 1997; Srivastava,\nShervani and Fahey 1998; Stahl, Matzler and Hinterhuber 2003) and\ninnovation (Wilson 1996; Thomke and von Hippel 2002). Learning and\ninformation benefits contribute slightly differently to the value of the firm.\nRather than reducing the costs of customer acquisition, they enhance the\noverall competitiveness and revenues \/ efficiency of the firm (Cravens, Piercy\nand Prentice 2000; Stahl, Matzler and Hinterhuber 2003).\nIt is difficult to account for indirect value. For example, the impact of advocacy\nor reference benefits is to reduce the cost of customer acquisition, which\nincreases the financial value of the acquired customer but does not affect the\nvalue of the referring customer. Learning and innovation benefits may or may\nnot increase the financial value of the customer generating them, through\nincreased sales or reduced costs, but they can also increase the overall\nrevenues or improve the overall efficiency of the supplier (Table 2).\n- Bring in Table 2 -\nTable 2 illustrates the difficulty of evaluating indirect value in financial terms.\nJenkinson (1995) suggests adding the revenues generated from relational\nbenefits to the calculation of the value of the customer, although it is unclear\nhow this is to be done without double counting (Ryals 2002). Since the\nindirect value of a customer relationship is usually described as additive to the\nfinancial value (e.g. Wilson 1996; Stahl, Matzler and Hinterhuber 2003),\n9current financial valuation models based solely on net present value using\ncustomer lifetime value or customer equity probably understate the value\ncreated by customers. To find out how serious this understatement is,\ncompanies need to determine the indirect value of their customers. Figure 1\nillustrates these two sources of value from customer relationships, financial\nand indirect.\n- Bring in Figure 1 near here -\nThe purpose of the current research was to explore how marketing and\naccount managers could place a value on indirect benefits and whether the\nresults would change the way in which those customer relationships were\nmanaged.\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe research approach was exploratory and descriptive, so a case study\nmethod was chosen (Patton and Appelbaum 2003). Two participating\ncompanies were selected to explore the process of valuing indirect benefits\n(Eisenhardt 1989; Yin 2002). Both participating companies were large\ninternational corporations from the financial services industry, one business-\nto-business and the other business-to-consumer. The companies met the\ntheoretical sample requirements (Patton and Appelbaum 2003) which, in this\ncase, were acceptance of the need for measurement of indirect value; an\nestablished customer management operation; good data-gathering\nprocesses; and a relative familiarity with the financial valuation of customers\n10\nusing customer lifetime value or customer equity approaches. Case study 1,\na business-to-business case study, examined indirect value for major\ncustomers whose individual lifetime value had already been forecast. Case\nstudy 2, a business-to-consumer example, examined a set of customers\nwhose customer equity had already been forecast.\nThe methodology was inductive, using one-on-one interviews and team-based\nworkshops (Gummesson 2000) to collect both quantitative and qualitative\ndata (Yin 2002). These data were used to develop pro-formas or produce\nprovisional results that were then discussed at further interviews and\nworkshops. Multiple iterations were carried out and, at each stage, the\nparticipating marketing and account managers were asked about the results\nand the implications for customer management practices.\nThe research produced interesting results relating both to processes for\nmeasuring the indirect value of customer assets and to the impact on\ncustomer management of applying these processes.\nRESULTS: CASE STUDY 1\nCase study 1 (business-to-business) focused on a small number of individual\ncustomers all having high customer lifetime value and where the indirect value\nwas thought to be important. Eight customers who accounted for 47% of the\ncustomer portfolio by revenue were selected for study. Two processes for\ncalculating indirect value were explored, one subjective and the other\n11\nmonetary. The first process used a weighting and scoring system (WSS); the\nsecond process imputed additional financial value directly to the relationship\nwith individual customers.\nThe WSS process began with a workshop to explore whether, unprompted,\nthe managers would identify the same relational attractiveness factors that\nhad been identified in the literature. In fact, only one factor overlapped. This\nwas Profile, identifiable as referenceability (Table 3).\n- Bring in Table 3 here -\nThese results suggest that indirect value is not well understood, even for more\nimportant customers. Three of the four \u2018indirect value\u2019 factors identified by the\naccount managers during the first iteration (Relationship, Resources, and Skill\nDemands) turned out to affect costs to serve and ought therefore to be\nconsidered under the heading of direct financial value.\nFigure 2 shows the results of the second iteration. Financial attractiveness\nwas based on customer lifetime value, and the size of the circle indicated\nwhether the customer was relatively high, medium or low revenue).\n- Bring in Figure 2 here -\nFigure 2 is suggestive of a relationship between financial and indirect\nattractiveness. There are some practical reasons that this might be true:\n12\nlarger customers are likely to be bigger, better-known companies with higher\nreferencability and greater learning and innovation value. However, the initial\noutputs of the WSS process (Table 3) also indicated a tendency for managers\nto confuse financial and indirect value. More research would be needed to\nestablish the relationship between financial and indirect value, using an\nobjective valuation method such as those discussed below.\nAlthough the WSS process for determining indirect value suffered from some\ndrawbacks as described above, it did help the managers in this team to\nresolve a current business issue relating to how they could identify their\ncompany\u2019s key accounts (Figure 3). Figure 3 uses the convention for\ncustomer portfolios of a reversed X axis (e.g. McDonald, Rogers and\nWoodburn 2000).\n- Bring in Figure 3 here -\nFigure 3 illustrates an additional finding from this case study, which was that\nthe identification of a key account might take account of both financial and\nindirect value. Although high financial value was a strong identifier of key\naccount status, high indirect value might also be sufficient for key account\nstatus. This was the case for customers such as C and F shown in Figure 2,\nwhose indirect value was considerably higher than their financial value. The\nWSS process also resulted in managerial action in the case of low-scoring\ncustomer H, shown towards the bottom of Figure 2. Examining the results, the\nmanagers felt that H\u2019s relatively low financial and indirect value meant that it\n13\nshould no longer be considered a key account. They made a decision to\nreduce its status; service levels and customer management practices were\nadjusted accordingly. The analysis summarised in Figure 2 enabled the team\nto make clearer decisions about which customers should \u2013 and should not \u2013\nbe considered as key accounts.\nThe second process tested in case study 1 was whether specific financial\namounts could be attributed to indirect value.\nPutting a financial value on indirect value\nFollowing consultations with the research company finance managers and\nwith finance academics, a probabilistic forecasting process was selected to\nput an expected monetary value on relational benefits. The probabilistic\nprocess reduced the problem of double counting noted by Jenkinson (1995)\nand Ryals (2002) whilst still resulting in a noticeable difference to the value of\nthe customer.\nFor trialling purposes, major customer G was considered. The managers felt\nthat the most likely type of relational benefit from G, which is a large and high-\nprofile drinks company, was customer attraction through referenceability and\nadvocacy. The managers forecast that their relationship with customer G was\ncertain to help them win one new customer the following year and likely to\nhelp them win two new customers in year 2 and a fourth customer in year 3.\nWithout customer G, there would be a zero probability of acquiring these\ncustomers. Moreover, probabilities of benefits in future years would be\n14\ncontingent on the relationship in earlier years, so conditional probabilities\nwere used to calculate the monetary impact. Assuming a discount rate of\n10%, the net present financial value of the increased probability of customer\nacquisition thanks to the relationship with customer G was \u00a3468,538 (Table\n4).\n- Bring in Table 4 -\nIn all, this exercise was repeated for four of the eight customers and resulted\nin an increase of 6.4% in the total net present value of those four customers.\nThere were considerable differences in the perceived indirect benefits, with\nfully 76% of relational benefits identified as relating to customer G.\nDetermining the expected monetary amount of G\u2019s indirect value resulted in\nan increased focus on continuing this relationship; as one key account\nmanager commented:\n\u201cIf we build up positive relationships with customers and learn from\nthem, those customers also wish to learn from us and then we continue\nto work together and grow\u2026\u201d\nThe probabilistic forecasting method necessitates a series of assumptions\nabout the acquisition timing and financial value of potential customers. The\ncase demonstrates empirically that managers were able to apply the process\nand generate financial numbers that seemed realistic to them as a proportion\nof the value of customer G. The findings also suggested that indirect value\n15\nmight differ considerably between customers. This differential would be an\ninteresting topic for future research.\nRESULTS: CASE STUDY 2\nThe second case study, also in financial services, was in a very different\ncontext. Here, business-to-consumer research was carried out within the retail\nloans department of a bank. This case study was based on an examination of\n123,442 loan applications by customers representing 100% of applications\nduring a three-month period.\nAn initial workshop with the marketing managers quickly established that the\nWSS process was not viable with this sample size. Moreover, there were\nlimited indirect benefits because the lender did not identify its customers\npublicly or exploit its relationships. At the time of the case study the bank was\nnot collecting formal data about advocacy because it was not believed to be\nfinancially valuable, even though the bank\u2019s own research data suggested\nreasonably high intention to advocate. As one of the senior marketing\nmanagers observed at the beginning of the process:\n\u201cIf I\u2019m honest, I\u2019m a bit sceptical about whether there will actually be\nsufficient numbers to make it worthwhile but, unless you investigate it\n\u2026 you\u2019ll never know.\u201d\n16\nThe data in Table 5 were drawn from a re-analysis of marketing research data\nover the three-month period and based on the responses of 300 customers\nper month (900 responses in total).\n- Bring in Table 5 -\nTable 5 shows that customer satisfaction within the loans department was\nhigher than for the company as a whole, although complaints were also\nsubstantially higher. This dichotomy illustrates a known problem with\ncustomer satisfaction as a predictor of repurchase (Reichheld 2003). A\nsubsequent regression analysis carried out by the bank determined that\nadvocacy was a more useful predictive measure than customer satisfaction,\nsupporting Reichheld\u2019s (2003) contention. As one of the marketing analysis\ncommented:\n\u201cA very large chunk of the people who say they are completely\nsatisfied, it is simply because we haven\u2019t done anything wrong. It\u2019s not\nbecause they are delighted with us.\u201d\nPutting a monetary value on advocacy\nAs the bank had no data on the actual incidence of referrals, the research\nfocused on estimating the monetary value of advocacy based on triangulating\nan output measure (proportion of advocates) drawn from live data, with input\nmeasures (proportion of customers where advocacy was a declared reason\ninfluencing purchase) generated from two sources: research estimates and\nmanager interviews. First, the marketing and database managers made\n17\nestimates of the value of advocacy based on analysis of customer records\nand behaviour. These estimates were then triangulated through primary\nresearch with managers who were selling loans.\nHaving identified those customers most likely to refer, the marketing and\ndatabase managers estimated the proportion of those saying that they were\n\u2018very likely\u2019 to refer who would actually do so (one third). This yielded a figure\nof 8,500 customers per month who were predicted to be advocates and a\nfurther estimate that one in 10 recommendations resulted in an application.\nGiven that the company rejected 46% of loan applications, this would\nrepresent 457 converted customers per month. Multiplied by the average\nvalue of a customer, this would yield an estimate of the financial value of\nadvocacy of \u00a3188,100 in revenue per quarter (0.75% of total revenue) and\n\u00a381,140 in profits per quarter (just over 0.7%).\nThese estimates of the financial value of advocacy made by the marketing\nmanagers were triangulated against interviews with six loan managers and\nbranch managers in four typical branches. These interviewees, who all spend\nthe majority of their time selling loans to customers, estimated that advocacy\naccounted for 2% to 3% of incoming customers which translated into 440 to\n660 customers per month. This estimate was noticeably higher than the\nprojections of the marketing managers, suggested that the impact of\nadvocacy had been understated by the central marketing team. Moreover, the\nloans managers were only reporting on the customers who had volunteered\ninformation about advocacy during the application process. As there was no\n18\nformal requirement to ask loan applicants why they had applied, it is likely that\nmany more incidents of advocacy went unreported.\nHowever, in financial services it is not just revenues but risk that is important,\nand the branch office interviews produced some intriguing observations about\nthe types and risk profiles of the customers arriving as a result of\nrecommendation (Table 6).\n- Bring in Table 6 -\nAs Table 6 shows, the managers identified three categories of referral: Family\n(thought to be most prevalent); Peer; and Colleague. Moreover, an interesting\nobservation was that the risk profile of the customer was felt by the managers\nto be similar to, or the same as, that of the advocate.\nThe managers noted several implications of this research for their marketing\nstrategy. The first was that advocacy was sufficiently prevalent to make it\nworthwhile tracking which customers had come through referral by including a\nspecific question to that effect on the loan application form. The second was\nthat the risk profile of the family, not just of the applicant, might be taken into\naccount when making a loan to the close relative of an existing customer.\nThird, the firm could analyse its database to identify clusters of customers all\nworking for the same company; this would be indicative of advocacy by a\nbusiness colleague. Finally, if the firm wanted to encourage referrals, it would\nhave to ensure that its pricing strategy was consistent with its advocacy\n19\nstrategy. The branch managers commented that sometimes they only became\naware that a customer was there as a result of advocacy when the customer\nqueried the rate (price) for the loan and complained that their relatives, friends\nor colleagues had got better deals:\n\u201cIf they\u2019re not getting the same rate as their friends or whoever they\u2019ve\nbeen talking to is getting, that can be a little bit difficult.\u201d\nThe research resulted in a change in advice to branch managers about how\ncustomer relationships were to be managed:\n\u201cWhile we still look at satisfaction, in terms of driving the things that we\nwant staff to do with customers there is much more that is actually\nunder their control in terms of relationship building with\nrecommendation [referrals] than there is with satisfaction.\u201d\nDISCUSSION\nIn recent years there has been considerable exploration of the financial value\nof customers. The need for net present value approaches (customer lifetime\nvalue and customer equity) is now widely accepted. However, research has\nalso indicated that customers can create additional indirect value (e.g. Stahl,\nMatzler and Hinterhuber 2003). This research used a case study approach to\nidentify and test three processes for evaluating the indirect value of a\n20\ncustomer. The three methods, and their advantages and disadvantages, are\nsummarised in Table 7.\n- Bring in Table 7 -\nIn case study 1, two processes were used. The indirect value of customers\nwas measured first with a WSS and then using a probabilistic forecasting\napproach. The WSS approach resulted in a managerial tool for the\nidentification of key accounts and a decision to downgrade one company to\nnon-key account status, changing the way that it was managed. The second,\nprobabilistic approach indicated that relational benefits could be substantial\nand might be positively associated with financial value, although more\nresearch would be needed to determine the accuracy of probability estimates.\nManagerially, the findings confirmed the importance of one particular\ncustomer that was already known to be financially attractive. The discovery of\nsubstantial indirect benefits increased the customer management team\u2019s\ninvestment in this account.\nIn case study 2, the indirect value of customers was thought to consist entirely\nof advocacy. In the event, three sources of advocacy were identified: Family,\nPeer, and Colleague. Of these, Family advocacy was thought to be the most\nfrequent although Peer or Colleague advocacy could result in the acquisition\nof multiple customers and so might be more valuable overall. Managers also\nnoted that the source of referral might indicate the risk of the acquired\ncustomer. These findings led to a reassessment of the importance of\n21\nadvocacy to the company that also affected pricing and loan acceptance\ndecisions.\nThe wider applicability of this research is to supplement and extend the\nconcept of customer lifetime value \/ customer equity. Typically, such\ncalculations incorporate the stream of future value from one customer or\ngroup of customers, usually measured in terms of future product or service\npurchases. It is rare for such calculations to include consideration of the value\nof advocacy, referencability, learning, or innovation. This research\ndemonstrates three methods for calculating indirect value and attributing it to\nthe customers who are generating that value. The empirical testing of these\nmethods reveals that indirect value can be substantial, and may result in\nchanges to customer management.\nLimitations and future research\nThe limitations of this research relate to the generalisability of the results from\ntwo case studies, both in financial services and both examining contractual\nrelationships. In the first case study, only eight customers were studied and\ndetailed financial evaluation of indirect value was completed on just four.\nHowever, these were major customers and the monetary value attributed to\nthe relational aspects of the relationship was considerable. In the second case\nstudy, the sensitive nature of the product (personal loans) and the firm\u2019s\nexisting customer management practices meant that indirect value was\nconfined to advocacy. It is uncertain whether other sources of indirect value\ncould be obtained from these relationships if they were managed differently.\n22\nSeveral questions for future research are set out in Table 8.\n- Bring in Table 8 -\nThe first question for future research is whether financial and indirect value\nare positively related. If customers with a higher lifetime value also have a\nhigher indirect value, this would provide further substantiation for customer\nmanagement practices such as key account management and CRM. A\nsecond question relates to the subjectivity of probability evaluations by\naccount managers; it is not clear whether the change in probability of a\nrelational benefit can accurately be measured.\nAdditional future research questions are raised by case study 2, which raised\nthe intriguing possibility that the risk\/ return profiles of referred and referring\ncustomers might be similar. If this is generally the case, companies need to\nthink carefully about which customers they target for referrals (Reichheld\n2003), particularly in sectors such as financial services. This case study also\nsuggests that the main indirect value in business-to-consumer services might\nbe advocacy. There are some indications of this in East et al. (2005), although\nthey find a much higher impact of advocacy in other service industries than\nwas the case in the current research.\nCONCLUSION\n23\nThe contribution of the paper was to propose and empirically test three\nprocesses for evaluating the indirect value of a customer, demonstrating that\nthese processes produced managerially useful results that \u2018fill a gap\u2019 in\nconventional tools that measure the financial value of customers. The first\nprocess (WSS) needed care in application to prevent overlap between\nfinancial and indirect value, but produced a tool that helped the managers\nidentify key accounts. The other two processes enabled the companies to\nimpute a monetary amount to indirect value. This information was then used\nto shape customer acquisition and management strategies.\nOverall, this research has demonstrated that managers can put a value on\nadvocacy. It has also demonstrated that determining the indirect value of a\ncustomer is not only feasible but is managerially useful, as it leads to changes\nin the way that the customer is managed. Indirect value may influence the\nidentification of key accounts. It may also, through like-for-like advocacy,\naffect the risk profile of the customer base as well as its returns.\nThe research provides an extension to the widely-used tools of customer\nlifetime value and customer equity, demonstrating that there are substantial\nindirect benefits from customers that are not usually captured in conventional\nfinancial calculations.\n24\nREFERENCES\nAmbler, T. and Roberts, J.
