Introduction\n[2] It is well known that VHF and UHF signals can\ntravel to distances well beyond the horizon under\ncertain conditions. Several propagation mechanisms\nare responsible for this, in particular diffraction around\nthe Earth\u2019s curvature, refraction within the atmosphere,\nand scattering within the troposphere. Depending on the\nvertical profile of the atmospheric refractive index,\npropagation may be enhanced through superrefraction\nand ducting (see Craig [2003] for an introduction to\nthese topics).\n[3] In order to gather information about the occurrence\nof superrefraction\/ducting and signal-fading effects at\nfrequencies around 300 MHz with antenna heights ap-\npropriate to intership communications, an experimental\ninvestigation has been undertaken with a transmitter and\ntwo receivers deployed in the British Channel Islands.\nMeasurements were made over a period in excess of one\nyear, and a summary of the more important aspects is\npresented here.\n2. Experimental Configuration\n[4] During March 2001, a 25 W CW transmitter was\ninstalled on the north coast of Jersey. Two receiver sites\nwere installed providing unobscured (by islands, etc)\nover-sea paths: the first (March 2001) in St Peter Port,\nGuernsey (33.3 km), and the second (November 2001)\non the south coast of Alderney (48 km). A map indicat-\ning these sites is given as Figure 1. Log periodic\nantennas (nominal gain quoted by the manufacturers as\n10\u201312 dBi) were employed at all sites, the heights of\nwhich above the sea level are indicated in Table 1.\nMeasurements were made over the path to Guernsey\nfor a period of approximately 17 months. While operation\non Alderney began in November 2001 and continued until\nSeptember 2002, reception at this site was not continuous\n(a several month gap due to storm damage occurred soon\ninto the collection period, and since solar panels with\nlimited capacity were employed because of the lack of\navailable mains power, 24 hours\/day operation was not\npossible). Nonetheless, useful measurements were made\nat this site for a period of around 8 months.\n[5] In the data presentation, receiver power levels are\nquoted on a logarithmic scale on which 0 dBr corresponds\nto a power input to the receiver of \u0001107 dBm. This value\nis a dB or so less than the signal power that causes the\nautomatic gain control (AGC) to come into effect. Taking\nthe transmitter power and antenna gains (for which there is\nsome uncertainty) into account, 0 dBr corresponds to a\npath loss of approximately 168 dB.\nRADIO SCIENCE, VOL. 41, RS3005, doi:10.1029\/2004RS003207, 2006\n1Department of Engineering, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.\n2Now at Department of Computer and Communication Engineering,\nChienkuo Technology University, Changhua City, Taiwan.\nCopyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0048-6604\/06\/2004RS003207$11.00\nRS3005 1 of 13\n[6] During the course of the measurements, the trans-\nmitter alternated between two frequencies (248 and\n341 MHz), remaining on each for 3 min. Within each\n3 minute period, measurements were made of signal\nstrength over 30 second intervals with vertical, horizon-\ntal and cross polarizations.\n3. Tidal Conditions in the Channel Islands\n[7] The tidal range in the Channel Islands is relatively\nlarge. During 2003 for example, the maximum predicted\nrange in Guernsey was 9.9 m (high 10.1 m, low 0.2 m\nrelative to chart datum), in Jersey 11.5 m (high 11.9 m,\nlow 0.4 m relative to chart datum), and in Alderney 6.4 m\n(high 6.7 m, low 0.3 m relative to chart datum). High\nwater in Jersey occurs approximately 5 min before\nGuernsey, and in Alderney approximately 40 min later\nthan Guernsey.\n[8] The precise sea height at different points along the\npaths is difficult to estimate because of the complexity of\nthe tidal flows. Consequently, in the analysis presented in\nthis paper, the predicted tidal height at Sark (located\nbetween the three sites) has been employed. Also, it\nshould be noted that the actual day to day levels vary\nfrom those predicted because of the prevailing weather\nconditions. The sea level is raised in the direction toward\nwhich the wind is blowing and vice versa, and a low\nbarometric pressure will raise the sea level by approxi-\nmately 0.1 m for a reduction in pressure of 11.3 mbar\nfrom the mean value.\n4. Some Theoretical Considerations\n[9] It is not the purpose of this paper to develop or to\nextensively reproduce the theory of VHF\/UHF propaga-\ntion over the sea, rather to present measurements of\nsignal strength variations, and to interpret these measure-\nFigure 1. Map showing the position of the transmitter and receiver sites.\nTable 1.

Consequently, the\nreader is referred to the original sources for full details.\n4.1. Surface Waves\n[10] In analyzing this propagation mechanism near to\nthe Earth\u2019s surface, ground waves are often separated\ninto three components: direct, reflected and surface\nwaves. Bullington [1977] notes that the surface wave\ncomponent is the major component of ground waves for\nfrequencies of a few MHz, but of secondary importance\nat VHF and can be ignored at frequencies higher than\n300 MHz. Bullington [1977] further suggests that the\nsurface wave can be ignored for antenna heights, over\nseawater, greater than 3 m at 248 MHz and greater than 2\nm at 341 MHz, both heights being significantly less than\nthose employed in this investigation.\n4.2. Path Obscuration by the Earth\u2019s Curvature\n[11] For a signal to be received without significant\ndiffraction losses, adequate clearance between the direct\npath and any obstacles (including the ground) is essen-\ntial. The curvature of the Earth results in a bulge along\nthe paths, reaching a maximum of 21.4 and 45.2 m\nrespectively at the midpoints of the paths to Guernsey\nand Alderney. Atmospheric refractive index effects will\nnormally result in a decrease in the effective Earth\ncurvature, reducing the bulge height (for example, the\nk = 4\/3 rule of thumb would reduce the bulge heights to\n16.1 and 34.0 m respectively). The necessary clearance\nbetween the direct path and an obstacle is usually\nexpressed in terms of the Fresnel zone. A commonly\nemployed criterion is that 0.6 of the first Fresnel zone\nshould be unobstructed [Bacon, 2003]. The radii of the\nfirst Fresnel zones at the midpoints of our paths are given\nin Table 2, and since these values are well in excess of\nthe antenna heights employed, significant diffraction\nlosses are to be expected.\n4.3. Diffraction Loss With a Smooth Spherical Earth\n[12] The diffraction path loss may be considered as the\nsum of the free-space loss which exists in the absence of\nobstacles and the diffraction loss introduced by the\nobstacles [Roda, 1988]. Formulae for signal attenuation\nlosses due to diffraction over a smooth, spherical Earth\nare given in ITU-R P.526-7 (these are consistent with\nthose given by Roda [1988]) for the condition where the\nreceiver lies within the shadow zone beyond the trans-\nmitter\u2019s horizon. Assuming a 4\/3 k factor, the amplitude\nversus tide height variations for both receiving sites\ndetermined from these equations predict a change of\nsignal amplitude of around \u00011.2 dB per meter increase in\nsea height, with a slightly higher value (\u00011.4 dB\/m) for\nvertically polarized signals at the higher frequency.\n4.4. Tropospheric Scattering for VHF\/UHF\nSignal Propagation\n[13] At sufficiently large distances beyond the horizon,\ndiffraction losses increase and tropospheric scatter (tro-\nposcatter) propagation becomes the dominant propagat-\ning mechanism [Griffths, 1987]. This mode of\npropagation arises because of the variations in refractive\nindex associated with irregularities in the meteorological\nparameters, such as humidity, temperature and pressure,\nat heights of several thousand meters. Electromagnetic\nradio waves are scattered by these irregularities resulting\nin usable propagation over the frequency range 100 MHz\nto 10 GHz.\n4.5. Overall Predictions With the Receiver in the\nShadow Zone\n[14] By applying the equations for free space, diffrac-\ntion and scattering losses associated with troposcatter,\nthe overall path attenuation due to these mechanisms can\nbe estimated. Figure 2 shows the total path losses for\nvertical polarization at the lower operating frequency\n(248 MHz), at distances up to 100 km with antenna\nheights of 18.5 m (transmitter) and 14.5 m (receiver)\nabove the Earth\u2019s surface, together with curves for these\nantenna heights \u00b15 m (note that in these calculations the\neffective Earth radius was assumed to be 8500 km (4\/3R\nrule)). These heights correspond to the heights of the\nantennas at Jersey and Alderney at midtide, together with\ncurves at approximately the tidal extremes. Curves for\nthe higher frequency and for horizontal polarization\ndiffer only in detail (the figures for both paths, frequen-\ncies and polarizations are given in Table 3). The range at\nwhich troposcatter is estimated to become the dominant\nmechanism appears on the plot as a kink in the curve at\naround 47 km for high-tidal conditions, increasing to\n72 km at low tide. This transition from diffracted to\ntroposcattered energy at these antenna heights and ranges\nis of particular significance for the 48 km path to Alderney.\n4.6. Superrefraction and Ducting\n[15] The situation described above depends upon the\natmospheric refractive index conditions being such that\nthe receiver lies in the shadow beyond the radio horizon,\nand also a constant lapse rate assumed to be that of an\naverage atmosphere (\u000140 N\/km, where N is the refrac-\ntivity defined as (n \u0001 1).106 and n is the refractive\nindex). With increasingly negative lapse rates, the tra-\njectory of the signal leaving the transmitter will have an\nTable 2. Fresnel Zone Radii at the Path Midpoints\n248 MHz, m 341 MHz, m\nJersey\u2013Guernsey 100.4 85.6\nJersey\u2013Alderney 120.5 102.9\nRS3005 SIM AND WARRINGTON: 300 MHz OVERSEA PROPAGATION MEASUREMENTS\n3 of 13\nRS3005\nincreasing tendency to bend toward the Earth, until with\na lapse rate of \u0001157 N\/km or less ducting to long ranges\nwill occur.\n[16] As the lapse rate becomes increasingly negative,\nthe signal travels further above the surface of the Earth\n(this may be considered as an increase in the effective\nEarth radius) and, consequently, the path obscuration\ndecreases. Ray tracing (assuming that geometrical optics\napply) indicates that for antennas located 15 m above the\nsea, superrefraction leads to the raypaths to Guernsey\nand Alderney being just above the Earth\u2019s bulge at lapse\nrates of approximately \u000150 and \u0001110 N\/km respectively,\nwith the clearances increasing more or less linearly to\n28 and 20 m respectively at a lapse rate of \u0001200 N\/km.\nNote however that even for rays that just clear the Earth\u2019s\nbulge, the diffraction losses may still be significant (in\nexcess of 10 dB) and the raypath would have to clear the\nEarth by a significant portion of a Fresnel zone for this to\nbecome minimal.\n4.7. Rough Sea Effects\n[17] The presence of waves on the sea surface will\nincrease the mean blockage, the effect being to raise the\nbulge of the Earth between the terminals by an amount\non the order of the significant wave height.\n[18] Theoretical considerations given by Matthew\n[1965] indicate that the sea surface can be considered\nas a smooth reflector if the variations of the surface are\nsuch as to cause variations in the path length of less than\nan eighth of a wavelength. The sea may therefore be\nconsidered as smooth if the wave height satisfies the\ncondition Hy < 3.6l where y is the angle of incidence\n(degrees), H is the sea wave height (m) and l is the radio\nwavelength (m).\n5. Jersey\u2013Guernsey Observations\n[19] During the majority of winter days and during\ncool summer days, the received signal amplitude dis-\nplayed a simple relationship to the tide height. This is\nFigure 2.

Air pressure, temperature and relative humidity\nare key parameters in the calculation of the refractive\nindex, and these parameters measured at Jersey and at the\nChannel Light Vessel are also shown in Figure 3,\ntogether with other meteorological parameters. Ideally,\nradiosonde measurements of the various meteorological\nparameters would have been made along the paths, but\nthe authors were unable to do this during these experi-\nments, hence the reliance on measurements at Guernsey,\nJersey and the Channel Light Vessel. Figure 4 depicts the\nvariation of signal amplitude with the tide height. A\ndecrease in signal level with increasing tide height is\nevident, the relationship being approximately 1.1 dB\nreduction in signal strength per meter increase in tide\nheight. This value is in good agreement with that\npredicted from the diffraction equations given in ITU-\nR P.526-7 [International Telecommunication Union\n(ITU), 2001] and by Roda [1988]. This consistency\nbetween the measurements and the theoretical values\nsuggest that the dominant propagation mechanism for\nthis path during calm weather conditions on winter and\ncool summer days is smooth Earth diffraction.\n[20] Although rough sea states or high wind speeds\nwere observed on a number of occasions, there were only\nthree occasions during spring 2001 on different days\nduring which the propagation appeared to be influenced\nby rough sea conditions. These amount to less than 0.1%\nof the total time.\n[21] One day for which the sea state appeared to affect\nthe signal amplitude was 7 April 2001. For this day, the\nwave height varied between 2 and 4 m and the wind\nspeed measured at the Channel Light Vessel varied\nbetween 6 and 18 m\/s. On one of the tides the vertically\npolarized signals were reduced in amplitude by between\n3 and 6 dB (see Figure 5 which exhibits two traces, the\nupper associated with \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 behavior, and the lower\ncorresponding to the decreased amplitude associated\nwith the rough sea state). No effect on the average signal\nlevel was apparent on the horizontally polarized signals.\nThe reasons for the amplitude reduction on the vertically\npolarized signals, but not on the horizontally polarized\nsignal, is not apparent. In addition, fading of up to 15 dB\nwithin a 30 second period was observed on the horizon-\ntally polarized signal close to high tide compared with\nfading of around 3 dB on the vertically polarized signal.\n[22] Very significant increases in signal strength oc-\ncurred on warm summer days (at such times the refrac-\ntive index decreases with height more rapidly than\nnormal resulting in superrefraction or ducting). An\nexample of measurements made on one such day together\nwith meteorological data is presented in Figure 6, and the\ncorresponding signal amplitude variation versus tide\nheight is presented in Figure 7. An increase in signal\nstrength in excess of 15 dB relative to the cool weather\ndays is apparent. It is interesting to note that the\noccurrence of enhanced signal strengths is reasonably\nwell correlated with the difference in temperature be-\ntween that of the air measured at Jersey airport and that\nof the sea exceeding 4\u0002C (see Figures 8 and 9). With\nsuch a relationship with the air\/sea temperature differ-\nence being apparent, it is unsurprising that the occurrence\nof such events was strongly dependent upon time of year\nwith hardly any occurring during the winter time and\nwith the peak occurrences during the summer. It is also\ninteresting to note the significant difference between\n2001 and 2002.\n[23] The enhanced signal strengths observed during\nwarm days possibly arise because of the presence of a\nsurface-based duct. However, with the meteorological\nmeasurements available to us, the existence of a surface-\nbased duct cannot be verified; to do this would require a\nvertical profile of pressure, temperature, and humidity\nmeasurements. However, the statistics shown in Figures 8\nand 9 at least provide a clue as to the possible existence\nof a surface-based duct (this requires not only a temper-\nature inversion to occur but a sharp gradient in relative\nhumidity; these parameters are coupled to produce a\nsurface-based duct).\n[24] Of particular interest from the systems planning\nviewpoint are the occurrence statistics, in particular the\noccurrence and duration of the periods of enhanced\nsignal strength and the magnitude of the signal strength\nincreases and when they occur. The magnitude of the\nincreases was determined relative to the observations on\na \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 day (i.e., one for which an approximately\nlinear variation in amplitude (measured in dB) relative to\ntidal height was observed). This statistical information is\ngiven in Table 4, each month considered separately.\n6. Jersey\u2013Alderney Observations\n[25] The receiving system in Alderney was established\nduring November 2001. The system was powered by\nsolar panels, and unfortunately the supply capacity was\ninsufficient for 24 hours per day operation, particularly\nduring the winter months. Data collection was also\ndisrupted a number of times because of occasional\nequipment failures and wind damage to the antennas.\nThe downtimes for the Alderney receiver make the\nproduction of fully developed statistics difficult. Never-\ntheless, data received for all seasons were analyzed and\nthe signal behavior during the measurement periods can\nbe segregated into several categories.\n[26] During periods of cold weather, a variation in\nsignal amplitude with tide height similar to that shown in\nFigure 4 for signals received in Guernsey was apparent.\nThe relationship was a little less linear for this path,\nRS3005 SIM AND WARRINGTON: 300 MHz OVERSEA PROPAGATION MEASUREMENTS\n5 of 13\nRS3005\nFigure 3.

An example of this is given in Figure 10, in\nwhich the received amplitude at Alderney is presented\nfor a 30 s interval (approximately 25 AGC samples per\nsecond). No such fading was evident on the shorter path\nto Guernsey at this time.\n[28] A possible mechanism for this is interference\nbetween the signal energy diffracted around the Earth\u2019s\nsurface and energy scattered from within the troposphere.\nFigure 2 illustrates the path loss calculated from the\nformulae given in ITU Recommendation P.526-7 [ITU,\n2001] and elsewhere [Matthew, 1965; Roda, 1988] for\nantenna heights corresponding to midtide and midtide\n\u00b15 m.

The observed values\nshown in Figure 10 may be compared with the predicted\nvalues in Figure 2. The suggested mechanism seems\nplausible since (approximately) 13 dBr on the signal\namplitude scale corresponds to a path loss of 155 dB.\n[29] It is interesting to note the seasonal variation of\nthis effect. In winter, short-term fading of up to around\nTable 4.

During calm\nspring days in May 2002 when the temperature had\nbegun to rise, the short-term fading of a few dB is\npredominant during periods of high water. Table 5\nindicates the fading range and period for two example\ndays, and Table 6 the percentage of the time for which\nthis type of fading occurred.\n[30] During warm weather, a high correlation was\napparent between the occurrence of enhanced signal\nstrengths (assumed to be due to superrefraction or\nducting) at Guernsey and Alderney. During August\n2002, for example, 129 hours were observed where both\nreceiving sites exhibited enhanced signal strengths, and\n121 hours when neither site exhibited this effect. In\ncontrast, there were only 11 and 5 hours when increased\nsignal strengths were exhibited only at Guernsey and\nAlderney respectively. Similar agreement was evident at\nother times of the year, details of which are provided in\nTable 7 for the period May\u2013September 2002.\n7. Summary and Concluding Remarks\n[31] Data collected over a period of 17 months over the\nJersey to Guernsey path from April 2001 until September\n2002 and 8 months of data for the Jersey to Alderney\npath from November 2001 until September 2002 have\nbeen analyzed. Comparisons have been made between\nthe received signal characteristics and several meteoro-\nlogical parameters such as sea state, weather conditions,\nseason, etc.\n[32] During times of calm sea state in winter, an\napproximately linear relationship between the signal\namplitude (measured in dB) and the tide height was\nobserved. The signal amplitude decreases by approxi-\nmately 1.1 dB for every meter increase in the sea level.\nLittle short-term fading was observed in Guernsey,\nhowever for the longer path to Alderney a fading range\nof around 10 dB was often observed. Statistically, this\nhigh level of fading varies dramatically from around 80%\nof the time to 31% during the autumn\/winter period from\nNovember 2001 until January 2002. The average fading\nperiod was around 7 s, with a maximum fading period of\napproximately 22 s and a depth of 12 dB during the\nautumn period.\n[33] During rough seas for the Jersey to Guernsey path,\non a few occasions (less than 0.1% of the time) it was\nobserved that the amplitude of the vertically polarized\nsignal was reduced by between 3 and 6 dB. The\nhorizontally polarized signal was not affected. Although\nother rough sea days occurred, this phenomenon did not\noften recur and was never observed in the Jersey to\nAlderney measurements. Its cause is therefore uncertain.\n[34] During cool summer days for the Jersey to Guern-\nsey path, similar signal behavior occurred to that ob-\nserved during calm sea winter days (i.e. , an\nTable 7.

Similar average\nsignal strength variations were also observed over the\nJersey to Alderney path. In the latter case, however,\nshort-term (several seconds) fading was observed mainly\nduring high tides (transmitting and receiving antennas at\nminimum height above sea level) during spring and\nsummer. For a cool summer day, the average short-term\nfading period was around 7 s with a maximum of 18 s,\nand a depth 7.5 dB.\n[35] During a hot summer day for the Jersey to\nGuernsey path, because of an increase in air temperature\nwith respect to the sea temperature and the consequent\nchange in the atmospheric refractive index profile, the\nsignal amplitude was increased by up to a maximum of\n21 dB. Statistically, the median increase in signal ampli-\ntude is around 3 dB, with upper and lower decile values\nof 10 and 1 dB respectively. Although there is little\nshort-term fading, longer-term fades in excess of 20 dB\nwere observed within periods of a few hours. The\nperiods of enhanced signal strength were observed to\nlast for periods of a few hours to 9 days continuously. In\ncontrast, during \u2018\u2018nonsummer\u2019\u2019 periods, periods of\nenhanced signal strength lasted from a few hours up to\na day with signal amplitude increases of up to around\n5 dB. Enhanced signal strengths appeared around 45 to\n60% of the time during summer 2001 and around 20 to\n35% of the time during summer 2002. This difference\nresulted from the fact that the summer of 2002 was\ncooler than that of the preceding year. In winter, the\noccurrence of enhanced signal strength was for less than\n10% of the total time.\n[36] During a hot summer day for Jersey-Alderney\nwhen enhanced signal strengths occurred throughout\nthe day, the increase in signal amplitude and the fading\ncharacteristics are similar to the Jersey-Guernsey path.\nAlthough there is much similarity (e.g., period of occur-\nrence) between Jersey-Guernsey and Jersey-Alderney,\nthe differences in signal amplitude increase on the same\nday for both receiving sites could be up to 10 dB.\n[37] Acknowledgments.
