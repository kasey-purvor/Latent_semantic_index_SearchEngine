Introduction \nThe challenge of improving public services is of central importance to low-income \ncountries, where large swathes of the population suffer high burdens of ignorance, \ndisease, poverty and malnutrition.  Many of the benefits of success have been underlined \nby the recent experiences of Sri Lanka and Kerala, two low-income cases where \nindicators of social development1 have raced ahead of economic growth (Alailama and \nSanderatne 2000, Krishnan 2000, V\u00e9ron 2001).  Both examples suggest that success \nresulted from policies that extended primary services throughout the population, leading \nto gradual \u2013 but over time significant \u2013 improvements in education, health, mortality, and \nsimilar indicators of social development.  But beyond these general observations, the \nquestion of how to organize and implement public service reforms to achieve such goals \nhas no easy answers (World Bank 2004). \n One of the measures most commonly advocated for improving public services is \ndecentralization.  By \u201cbringing services closer to the people\u201d, proponents argue, the \nquality of governance will be improved, and with it the quality of services that the public \nsector provides (or regulates).  The slogan \u201cbringing government closer to the people\u201d \ncan be disaggregated into three distinct advantages that, it is argued, decentralized \ngovernment has: \n(i) More and\/or better information \n(ii) More accountability \n(iii) More voice and participation. \nBy creating local governments beholden to local citizens, it is argued, public decision-\nmaking will benefit from improved information about local needs and place-specific \n 1\ncharacteristics (e.g. geography, weather), the performance of public officials will be \neasier to scrutinize, and citizens will find it easier to participate in public debates and \ndecisions.  As a result, public policy will rise in quality, public investments will be better \nattuned to local priorities and conditions, and infrastructure and services will be more \nsustainable in the long run, as citizens will feel \u201cownership\u201d over their production and \nmaintenance (some influential references in this regard include Manor 1999, Putnam \n1993, World Bank 1994, and Wallis and Oates 1988). \n As we shall discuss in detail below, the reasons for thinking that decentralization \nwill do these things are strong.  But empirical evidence in favor, oddly, is mixed and \u2013 \ntaken as a whole \u2013 weak.  This leaves reformers in a quandary.  Can local government \nreforms improve social services and hence increase social development?  This paper \nexamines the question empirically with new, detailed evidence on good and bad cases of \npublic service effectiveness.  We focus on sub-national variation within a single country, \nBangladesh, in order to explore the institutional and social bases of high vs. low levels of \nsocial service provision, and hence high vs. low levels of social development.  The \nbackground to this is Bangladesh\u2019s decentralization program, which began in 1997 with \nthe Local Government Act, followed by the Upazila and Zilla Parishad Acts of 1998 and \n2000.  These reforms have served, according to the accepted taxonomy, to \n\u2018deconcentrate\u2019 the country\u2019s administration to division, district, sub-district, and union \nlevels, but have stopped short of full devolution to any of them. \nBut it is useful to first review Bangladesh\u2019s recent development trends.  The last \n15 years have brought significant progress to the country, which will come as a surprise \nto the many who still view Bangladesh through the lens of its immediate post-\n 2\nindependence experience.  In 1971, Henry Kissinger is said to have characterized \nBangladesh as an \u201cinternational basket case\u201d.  Other observers, aid agencies, and even \ntourist guides largely agreed in spirit, if not tone, describing the country as a site of \nrecurrent natural disasters, and a crowded labor reserve with few prospects for \ndevelopment (Faaland and Parkinson, 1976).  But in 1990-91 the country achieved a \nstructural break (i.e. a change in time-series parameters) in its growth and development \ntrends, and moved onto a new path of strong growth averaging 3.2% per capita between \n1990-2005 (Mahajan and Hussain 2006).  Economic growth was accompanied by healthy \nprogress in poverty reduction and other social indicators.  Just between 2000 and 2005, \nfor example, the share of the population living in poverty declined from 49% to 40%, and \nthat living in extreme poverty fell from 34% to 25% (Mahajan and Hussain 2006). \nLonger-term trends in poverty and broader indicators of social development show \neven faster progress.  Figure 1 details how social indicators have improved, often \ndramatically, between the years before the structural break, and the years since.  Because \nof these improvements, Bangladesh has already met its Millennium Development Goal \n(MDG) on gender parity in primary and secondary schooling a decade ahead of time, \nwith current girl:boy ratios of 48:52 in primary schools, and 52:48 in secondary schools.  \nFurther evidence shows that among 11-12 year olds, slightly more girls than boys \ncomplete the five-year cycle (73% vs. 72%; Chowdhury et al., 2003).  Bangladesh is \nlikely to meet its consumption poverty and child mortality goals as well, given realistic \ngrowth projections and continuing levels of social expenditure.  But other MDGs, such as \nmaternal mortality, primary school enrolment and completion, and child malnutrition, are \nunlikely to be met (World Bank 2007).  Accelerating progress in these areas is an \n 3\nacknowledged priority of both the government and donor communities.  One contribution \nof this paper is to analyze the place-specific institutional underpinnings of accelerated \nsocial development. \nFIGURE 1 HERE \nImpressive as these changes are, closer examination reveals striking and persistent \nvariation in social indicators across space.  Primary enrollment and primary completion \nrates are respectively 54% and 62% higher in the highest regions of the country than the \nlowest, for example.  Divergent trends occur even within the same city: the ratio of girls \nto boys in school is 30 points higher in \u201cOther Urban\u201d Dhaka than \u201cStandard \nMetropolitan Area\u201d Dhaka.  Child malnutrition, measles vaccination coverage and infant \nmortality also vary significantly across Bangladesh\u2019s regions.  And even these high levels \nof variation \u2013 essentially amongst different parts of the public service provision system \u2013 \nare trumped by variation between public and non-governmental service providers.  For \ninstance, Chaudhury (2006) uses data from 1994-2004 to show that areas of the country \nserved by Gonoshasthaya Kendra (GK), a pioneer NGO in health care, reduced infant \nmortality consistently to levels of 32 per thousand live births in 2004, while the country \nas a whole remained well above 50. \nWhat explains such stark differences?  Following North (1990), Olson (2000), \nWilliamson (1995), and other institutional theorists, the analysis in this paper is \npredicated on the notion that differences in social indicators are explained by the wide \nvariation in levels of primary service provision (e.g. education, health care) across \nBangladesh.  Variations in service provision are largely explained by the differing \npatterns of accountability and objective incentives that local officials face.  And \n 4\nfollowing Bourdieu (1986), incentives and accountability are, in turn, largely explained \nby the underlying understandings and dispositions that individuals must share if formal \nand informal institutions are to work effectively.  The causal pathway looks like this: \nUnderstandings Local accountability Local provision of Social development\nand dispositions and incentives primary services outcomes  \n Hence to understand success and failure in public service delivery, we must go \nbeyond the organizations that produce them, beyond the institutions in which they are \nenmeshed, and beyond even the informal rules and conventions that govern incentives.  \nWe must go down to the underlying beliefs, understandings and dispositions that drive \nsocial behavior, and so help determine whether a given set of organizations and their \npolicies can successfully meet the needs of citizens, or not.  By focusing our analysis at \nthis level we can better understand the incentives faced by both the producers and users \nof public services, and hence the degree of accountability that public servants face.  And \nwhen we understand incentives and accountability, institutional theorists tell us, we are a \nlong way towards understanding public sector effectiveness. \nThis paper analyzes the operation of such a pathway in Bangladesh via a close \nexamination of the social and institutional underpinnings of service provision in two \nupazilas (sub-districts).  Upazilas are the third of four levels of sub-national \nadministration in Bangladesh, with an average population of 250,000, and are roughly \nsimilar to municipalities elsewhere.2  Going from higher to lower, Bangladesh has six \nDivisions, 64 Districts, 460 Upazilas, and 4,401 Union Parishads.  Union Parishads \ntypically comprise 15-20 villages, encompassing some 25,000 people.  There are over \n70,000 villages in Bangladesh (Library of Congress 2008). \n 5\nOur two cases were chosen purposively from the extremes of high and low-\nperforming upazilas in terms of social development outcomes, focusing especially on \nmaternal and child mortality.  We do not pretend that these \u2013 or indeed any \u2013 two cases \nconstitute a \u201csample\u201d, or are in any sense representative of Bangladesh.  Rather, we chose \nextremes of performance in the hope of gaining analytical richness and insight into the \nobject of our research: the causes of good and bad social development outcomes.  For the \nsake of focus and brevity, we dwell mostly on the health sector.  Saturia is the high-\nperforming upazila, and Rajnagar is the low-performer. \nOur evidence is based on extensive qualitative and quantitative fieldwork by a \nteam from the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (see methodology annex for \nmore details).  It indicates that two factors are responsible: (1) Health care provision is \nsystematically better in Saturia, with services more suited to the needs and characteristics \nof the local population made available to more villages more frequently than in Rajnagar; \nand (2) services are in much higher demand in Saturia, with greater knowledge of the \nbenefits of health care, greater acceptance of modern clinical methods, and fewer barriers \nto access due to traditional customs and beliefs.  We explain this two-fold difference as a \nfunction of the deeper institutional and social context in which services are provided, and \ndemanded, in each upazila. \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 reviews the literature on \ndecentralization and local governance, focusing on the question of effective service \nprovision and the positive outcomes this can generate.  Section 3 provides descriptive \nstatistics of social development \u201coutputs\u201d in Saturia and Rajnagar, and connects these to \ndifferences in primary service provision \u201cinputs\u201d.  Section 4 explains differences in \n 6\nservice provision as a function of local institutional settings that differ critically in the \nincentives and accountability that obtain in each.  Section 5 concludes. \n2. Literature Review: Institutions, Accountability and Social \nDevelopment \n \nThe importance of accountability to \u201cgood governance\u201d has become a development \nnostrum in recent years (UNDP 1993, World Bank 1994).  It is thus important to realize \nthat the notion of accountability, much more than a policy fad, is rooted in strong \ntheoretical arguments about the roles of incentives and information in democratic \ngovernance.  Theory predicts that the incentives and accountability that obtain in \ndemocratic politics will tend to promote good social development outcomes (Dahl 1989).  \nDemocratic theorists posit this as a principal positive argument in favor of democracy \nover other systems of government, alongside strong negative arguments about avoiding \nthe risks and costs of autocracy and dictatorship. \nBut the extension of such arguments to sub-national units, and hence to the question \nof decentralization, is a relatively recent phenomenon.  Indeed, the concept of \ndecentralization was essentially absent from political theory during the two millennia that \nseparate Plato\u2019s Republic from Rousseau\u2019s Social Contract.  Summarizing heroically, this \nis because the democratic ideal of ancient, medieval and renaissance times featured \nassemblies of free men who represented themselves directly.  Democracy was appropriate \nfor city-states with limited populations.  Large nations with large populations required \nmonarchical rule (Rousseau 1968 [1762]).  Decentralizing political authority was \nunnecessary in a city-state, and nonsensical in a monarchy, and hence the question did \nnot arise. \n 7\nThe advent of representative democracy changed this.  The new form came about in \ntwo ways: (i) in some countries (e.g. Britain), constitutional monarchy was gradually \ntransformed by the accretion of economic and social reforms into democracy, and (ii) in \nothers (France, US) democratic republics were created by revolution.  In the new \ndemocratic ideal, the many are represented in the legislature by the few, allowing \ndemocracy to flourish in much larger populations and territories. The great theorists of \nthe new American Republic, Madison, Hamilton and Jay, treated the question directly.  \nThey explored what powers states should have, and which should be reserved for the \ncenter, and carefully explored the implications of different balances of authority between \nhigher and lower levels of government.  In today\u2019s terms, their ideal was a highly \ndecentralized federation of states, albeit with a stronger center than under the doomed \nArticles of Confederation.  Five decades later, Tocqueville (1967 [1835, 1840]) described \nin admiring terms an American system of government more decentralized than any in \nEurope.  He admired this decentralization as consistent with democracy, and decried \nEuropean centralization as consistent with tyranny. \nThe theoretical basis of such a position is easy to understand, as it is simply an \napplication of the previous arguments about democracy to the question of geographic \nscale.  If the participation and accountability that obtain via democratic processes are \ngood for the quality of government and its responsiveness to citizens\u2019 needs, then \ndisaggregating decision-making from the national to regional and local levels \u2013 i.e. \ndecentralization \u2013 should improve quality and responsiveness further.  This view posits \nthat there exists a class of public services were economies of scale are low, and \nheterogeneity of demand\/need is high across space.  For such services, if spillovers3 are \n 8\nlow, local provision can bring about efficiency gains by tailoring supply in terms of \nindividual communities\u2019 demand\/need, costs, and other technical parameters. \nModern theorists have developed these ideas in a number of ways.  Tiebout (1956) \nposits a world in which individuals with heterogeneous tastes move costlessly between \nlocalities offering different combinations of public goods and taxes (to finance the \ngoods).  Given perfect information about the full range of options, a competitive \nequilibrium in locational choices will ensue, producing an efficient allocation. Although \nthis paper is usually viewed as the foundation of the economics of decentralization, it is \nfair to say that it has fallen out of favor recently.  This is because its assumptions of a \nhighly mobile population and fixed governments are unrealistic,4 and because it offers no \npolitical analysis of a question now viewed as fundamentally concerned with political \neconomy. \nOates (1972) builds on Tiebout in order to examine heterogeneity of tastes and \nspillovers more carefully.  Although this is another foundation stone of the economics of \ndecentralization, still there is no political mechanism, no democratic participation, and no \naccountability.  Besley and Coate (1999) provide politics, in a model of central policy-\nmaking in which elected representatives bargain over public goods provision in multiple \ndistricts.  For heterogeneous districts, they find that decentralization is welfare superior in \nthe absence of spillovers, and higher heterogeneity reduces the relative performance of \ncentralization for any level of spillover.  Hence under plausible assumptions, \ndecentralized government can be expected to provide public goods better suited to the \nneeds of heterogeneous populations, leading to higher levels of social development and \nimproving welfare. \n 9\nFor a literature that addresses the question of accountability, government \neffectiveness, and development outcomes more directly, we must look to political \neconomy work, such as Evans, Faguet, Tendler and Ostrom et al.  Questions surrounding \nthe state\u2019s capacity and willingness to drive forward broader developmental changes in \nsociety are central to the work of Evans, Tendler, and Ostrom, who deal with different \naspects of such themes in many of their works.  Unfortunately there is only space to \nreview a small portion of their considerable scholarship here.  Evans (1995) develops the \nhighly influential idea of \u2018embedded autonomy\u2019.  This holds that bureaucratic \n\u2018embeddedness\u2019 in the real economic conditions and needs of a country, but with \nsignificant \u2018autonomy\u2019 from interest groups and distributional coalitions, are the two \nessential characteristics that have allowed certain economies and societies to develop \nrapidly.  Evans (1996) extends the idea further, arguing that synergy between state and \nsociety can extend each others\u2019 developmental efforts, and that such synergies are most \nlikely in countries characterized by egalitarian social structures and robust, coherent \nbureaucracies.  In his view, such synergies are constructible, even where initial \nconditions are not promising, a point which we echo below. \nTendler (1997) argues that in order to create accountable sub-national governments \nlikely to drive forward development, decentralization should paradoxically be twinned \nwith a strong central state, or other committed national institution, such as a political \nparty or NGO.  Faguet (2007) attempts to explain high variation in local government \nperformance in Bolivian municipalities after the 1994 decentralization.  He models local \ngovernment as occurring at the confluence of two quasi-markets \u2013 one for votes and the \nother for political influence \u2013 and one organizational dynamic between government and \n 10\nelements of civil society.  Good government results when these three elements, political, \neconomic and civil, are in rough balance, and actors in one cannot distort the others.  \nSpecific types of imbalance \u2013 a dominant economic interest, for example, or a weak \ngovernment-society nexus \u2013 map into specific forms of government failure. \nAnd in the name of analyzing infrastructure policies, Ostrom et al. (1993) develop \nthe notion of polycentrism. Appealing to ideas of democratic representation and \naccountability, they argue for the theoretical benefits of decentralization.  They then \nanalyze how a system of asymmetric, overlapping jurisdictions centered at different \npoints, and designed to best suit the economic and technical characteristics of a variety of \npublic services \u2013 roads, ports, watershed management, schools and hospitals, for example \n\u2013 can raise efficiency and promote long-term sustainability. \nWith literally hundreds of studies over the past 40 years, the empirical literature is \nmuch larger than the theoretical literature.  But as Faguet (2004) and others have noted, \nempirical evidence on issues such as responsiveness to local needs and effects on social \ndevelopment, are mixed.  Taken as a whole, it is difficult to draw clear empirical lessons \nabout decentralization\u2019s potential for increasing social development.  Proponents, such as \nOlowu and Wunsch (1990), Shah (1988) and Wallis and Oates (1988) find evidence that \ndecentralization makes government more responsive to local needs by \u201ctailoring levels of \nconsumption to the preferences of smaller, more homogeneous groups\u201d (Wallis and Oates \n1988, 5).  Manor (1999) finds evidence that decentralized governments increased public \nsector responsiveness in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the Philippines, and India. \nUsing data from a sample of 80 countries, Huther and Shah (1998) provide \nevidence that devolving power and resources to local governments increases social \n 11\ndevelopment, political participation, and an overall quality of government index.  Parry \n(1997) find that greater local government power over educational services improved \neducational outcomes.  Rowland (2001) and Blair (2000) find that decentralization \nimproved the quality of democratic governance achieved in both large cities and small \ntowns.  Eskeland and Filmer (2002) find econometric evidence that decentralization did \nlead to improvements in Argentine educational achievement scores.  And in a study of \nBangladesh, Galasso and Ravallion (2000) use careful econometrics to show that pro-\npoor program benefits increased with decentralization in Bangladesh. \nOn the other hand, opponents such as Crook and Sverrisson (1999), Smith (1985) \nand Solnick (1996), counter that local government\u2019s lack of human, financial and \ntechnical resources, and greater propensity to corruption and elite capture, will prevent it \nfrom providing effective public services under decentralization, regardless of whether \nthey are \u201ctailored\u201d or not.  In a series of three studies of local government in Africa, Ellis, \nKutengule and Nyasulu (2003), Ellis and Mdoe (2003) and Ellis and Bahiigwa (2003), \nfind that decentralization will likely depress growth and rural livelihoods by increasing \nbusiness regulations and taxes that stifle private firms (Malawi), and propagate rent-\nseeking behavior down to the district and lower levels, so helping to entrench rural \npoverty, instead of solve it (Tanzania and Uganda). \nSimilarly, V\u00e9ron et al. (2006) use evidence from India to show that when upward \nties of accountability (e.g. to a political party) are weak, horizontal accountability \nstructures can degenerate into networks of corruption manipulated by \u201ccommunity\u201d \nactors.  Francis and James (2003) and Bahiigwa, Rigby and Woodhouse (2005) argue that \ndecentralized governments in Uganda, often captured by local elites, are not independent \n 12\nor accountable to voters, and so are not useful tools for poverty reduction.  Samoff (1990) \nasserts that decentralization reforms around the world have mostly failed, and finds the \nevidence on responsiveness strongly negative.  Slater (1989) supports this position with \nan example from Tanzania, where decentralization did not serve the interests of the poor, \nbut rather allowed a militarized autocracy to penetrate deeper into the countryside.  Akin, \nHutchinson and Strumpf (2005) find that decentralization in Uganda led local \ngovernments to invest less in public goods, and more in publicly financed private goods.  \nAnd Asthana (2003) finds that decentralization of water provision decreased efficiency, \nraising costs and lowering asset utilization. \nIf this short review makes for frustrating reading, so too do the longer ones.  A \nbroad international survey of local government reforms carried out in 1983 (Rondinelli et \nal.) finds that decentralization has seldom, if ever, lived up to expectations, at least partly \nbecause most countries implementing reform experienced serious problems of \nimplementation.  Twenty-one years later, Shah, Thompson and Zou (2004) review the \nempirical studies and find that decentralization has in some cases improved service \ndelivery, corruption and growth, but in other cases worsened them.  Our lack of progress \nin understanding decentralization is striking. \nWhat most of these studies have in common is that they are national-level studies of \none or more countries.  Few take municipalities or localities as their unit of analysis, and \nfewer still attempt to unlock the black box of local government decision-making in order \nto understand why some local governments perform well and others badly.  One \nexception is Faguet (2007), who examines local government effectiveness in two \nextremes of municipal performance.  Our paper most resembles his, only deeper.  Faguet \n 13\nexplains municipal performance in terms of economic and civic actors operating within a \npolitical structure.  Our analysis takes account of these factors, but then goes deeper \u2013 to \nthe social and cultural factors operating beneath the level of formal structure.  But before \nwe can enter into this analysis, we must introduce Saturia and Rajnagar. \n3. Divergent Development: Saturia vs. Rajnagar \nSaturia upazila is located in Manikganj district west of Dhaka, while Rajnagar \nupazila is located in Moulvibazar district on Bangladesh\u2019s eastern border with India.  \nDespite its greater distance from the capital, it is Rajnagar that is wealthier, with an \naverage household income of Tk.7,081\/month compared to Saturia\u2019s Tk.5,831\/month, \nand more livestock assets per family.5  Average landholdings are higher in Rajnagar, at \n182 decimals6 per household vs. 137 in Saturia.  And Rajnagar\u2019s literacy rate of 64% is \nalso higher than Saturia\u2019s 58%.  This is at least partly explained by the high levels of \nremittances families in Rajnagar receive from a large diaspora in the UK.  Indeed, the \nnearby airport in Sylhet boasts direct flights to London.  But Rajnagar is also more \nunequal, with more households in both the extreme poor and rich categories, while 86% \nof Saturia\u2019s population is concentrated in the intervening two categories. \nBut paradoxically, Saturia has systematically superior health indicators than \nRajnagar.  Under-five mortality in 2005 was 13 per thousand in Saturia, compared to 40 \nper thousand in Rajnagar; the prevalence of illness in Saturia is 25%, compared to 36% in \nRajnagar; and the notional maternal mortality rate over the previous 5 years7 was 0 in \nSaturia, compared to 791 per hundred thousand live births in Rajnagar.  The statistics on \ncomplications during childbirth tell the same story: mothers in Rajnagar suffered more \nfrom long labor, excessive bleeding, high fever and convulsions than mothers in Saturia.  \n 14\nIn light of this, it is not surprising that Saturia has had considerably more success in \nreducing its maternal and child mortality rates8 over the past few years than Rajnagar. \nFIGURE 2 HERE \nIt is also not surprising that much of this is due to superior provision of health \nservices and better infrastructure in Saturia.  Pregnant mothers receive more antenatal \ncare in Saturia (91%), for example, than Rajnagar (73%).  More mothers are informed \nabout the signs of pregnancy complications in Saturia (83%), and where to go when they \noccur (87%), than Rajnagar (63% and 73%).  Access to sanitary toilets is higher in \nSaturia (90%) than Rajnagar (69%).  More mothers receive vaccinations and nutritional \nsupplements during pregnancy in Saturia, and more have a post-partum check-up, and \nmore quickly, than Rajnagar.  Figure 3 summarizes additional data on child health \ninterventions and outcomes in the two upazilas. \nFIGURE 3 HERE \n If economic variables do not explain such divergent health outcomes, what does?  \nThe answer cannot relate to the structure of local government or the health sector, nor to \nthe quantity nor design of the physical infrastructure available, as these are common to \nboth upazilas.  Both Saturia and Rajnagar benefit from the same upazila administrative \napparatus, with similar levels of staffing and finance.  And both are served by the \nMinistry of Health and Family Planning, which in Bangladesh employs a particularly \nstandardized, homogeneous model of health provision that deploys assets uniformly, \nallocates resources mechanically, and is as a result insensitive to local characteristics or \nvariations in local demand (Pearson 1999). \n 15\nIt is important to note that this does not imply stasis in Bangladesh\u2019s health sector.  \nIndeed, both sub-districts benefited from health reforms during the past two decades.  \nThe fourth five-year plan (1990\/91-1994\/95) re-oriented health policy towards combating \nmaternal and infant mortality through major immunization drives, family planning, and \nattention to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases in children.  This was followed in the fifth \nfive-year plan with the introduction of the Essential Services Package (ESP) for the \nhealth sector, which seeks to provide a common core of basic services related to \nchildren\u2019s health, communicable diseases, reproductive health, and some curative care \n(Pearson 1999).  Key elements in both five-year plans included fomenting community \nparticipation in the production of health services, and more intensive service delivery \n(Ensor et al. 2002; Ministry of Health and Family Welfare 2008).  Public health experts \ngenerally agree that these reforms have contributed significantly to Bangladesh\u2019s \nimproving health indicators (Ensor et al. 2002; World Health Organization 2008).  But \ntheir impact in Saturia and Rajnagar has not differed.  Hence variations in performance \nmust be due to something else. \nIf the answer is not local health \u201chardware\u201d, is there something in the health \nsystem\u2019s \u201csoftware\u201d that might explain differences in performance?  A visit to each \nupazila is telling in this regard.  There are numerous, obvious differences in the \nmaintenance and operation of the health facilities at hand.  Field visits to each Upazila \nHealth Complex (UHC) found Saturia\u2019s was well-maintained and clean, with more \nbathrooms available, all clean and in working order, the operating room in good repair \nand used regularly, and staff absenteeism of 1%.  In Rajnagar, by contrast, most of the \nrooms, wards, windows and doors were damaged, its toilets were so dirty they had \n 16\nbecome unusable, the operating room was unused and abandoned, and staff absenteeism \nwas 10%.  Unfortunately for the residents of Rajnagar, health workers made far fewer \ncommunity visits than in Saturia, leaving them more reliant on this degraded \ninfrastructure.  Detailed interviews revealed that patients in Saturia were quite happy \nabout the quality of services they received, while in Rajnagar opinions were decidedly \nmixed. \nThese differences grow sharper at the union level.9  The Union Health and Family \nWelfare Center (UHFWC) visited in Rajnagar was badly understaffed, with no doctor in \ncharge.  This forced it to close when staff attended at Satellite Clinics (SCs) in the \nvillages, leaving it open only three days a week.  The UHFWC in Saturia, by contrast, \nwas fully staffed and open 5 days a week.  Facilities were well maintained and clean in \nSaturia, but badly maintained and dirty in Rajnagar, with the toilets once again unusable.  \nBoth have electricity, but almost no lights or fans worked in Rajnagar, rendering the \noperating room inoperable.  In Saturia all of the above did work, and the operating room \nwas in regular use.  The tubewell did not function in Rajnagar, and the water supply lines \nwere damaged, while Saturia\u2019s water infrastructure was in good repair.  In Saturia \nmedicines and family planning supplies were well stocked and regularly replenished, \nwhereas Rajnagar received family planning supplies but no medicines from the Ministry. \nAs we might expect, the combination of superior facilities and happier patients \nled to greater popularity amongst the population \u2013 the Saturia facility treated 8,000 \npatients in 2005, while the Rajnagar facility managed only 4,400, despite a larger overall \npopulation.  These differences were reflected at the village level, where the Saturia SC \nwas better endowed with health and sanitary equipment, including a toilet, which the \n 17\nRajnagar SC did not have.  On the day each was visited, 85 patients were treated at the \nSaturia SC compared to just 24 at the Rajnagar SC.  The dysfunctionality of Rajnagar\u2019s \nUHFWC, of course, contributed to heavier use of its upazila health complex, despite the \nproblems identified at the latter.  Because a UHC is a higher-cost installation than a \nUHFWC, the upwards deflection of patients in Rajnagar led to higher overall costs for a \ngiven number of treatments.  Thus in Saturia, better functioning of the health services \npyramid not only extended services to more patients, but effectively reduced unit costs. \nThe objective differences in healthcare provision between the two upazilas \ntranslate directly into subjective measures of the quality of healthcare received.  Patients \nin Saturia reported far higher satisfaction with a number of important factors, including: \nthe attitudes of their doctors and other service providers, attitudes of office staff, physical \ninfrastructure, utilities, cleanliness and hygiene, privacy of treatment, quality of food, \nwaiting time, availability of doctors, availability of drugs, availability of medical supplies \nand the quality of treatment received.  Patients in Saturia reported much shorter waits for \ntreatment than those in Rajnagar, and 72% thought they would be able to follow doctors\u2019 \ninstructions, vs. 56% in Rajnagar. \nIn summary, the structure of the public health system, and the quantity and design \nof its assets, were quite similar across both upazilas.  But these assets were maintained \nand exploited in quite different ways, leading to significant differences in the quality and \nquantity of services provided in the two upazilas.  These differences led to important \ndifferences in real health outcomes, and explain why people in Saturia suffered from \nfewer diseases, and had healthier mothers and children, than those in Rajnagar.  The link \n 18\nbetween better health services and improved outcomes is further supported by a detailed \neconometric analysis of the two areas (Ali and Rahman, 2006). \n4. Institutional Determinants of Divergent Development \nSo far we have good proximate causes of the variation in health outcomes.  But to \nfind the deeper determinants, we must go further.  Why were infrastructure and \nequipment deployed differently in the two districts?  Why were they cleaned and \nmaintained in one but not the other?  To answer these questions we must follow the \nexamples of Evans, Tendler and Ostrom and dig deeper into the local institutional context \nin which the health sector operated, identifying the underlying incentives and behaviors \nat work.  And to explain variations in this institutional context, we must go deeper still, \nand consider how the districts\u2019 histories and geographies impacted upon people\u2019s beliefs \nand social relations. \n Consider first the question of monitoring.  Focus group discussions revealed \nimportant differences in the way that public services were monitored in the two upazilas.  \nHealth authorities in Saturia reported extensive monitoring by their superiors at the \ndistrict level, with frequent visits to the area, whereas their similars in Rajnagar reported \nno such monitoring.  This establishes upwards accountability for Saturia\u2019s health system, \nbut not for Rajnagar\u2019s.  Accountability also works in the downward direction in Saturia, \nwith the active involvement of union parishad10 (UP) officials in health delivery issues.  \nFocus groups testified that the UP chairman takes steps to facilitate the proper \nimplementation of Saturia\u2019s health program, and union officials regularly monitor the \nquality of services provided in town and villages. \n 19\nOur research team corroborated this when we found the chairman observing \nimmunizations in different areas of his union on National Immunization Day.  When \nasked why he did so, he responded, \u201cAs the local people\u2019s elected representatives, it\u2019s our \nresponsibility to monitor whether they\u2019re getting the services they\u2019re supposed to receive.  \nWe keep tabs on whether health authorities are providing proper services to the people or \nnot, and visiting villages in a timely fashion or not.\u201d  We found no evidence of any of this \nin Rajnagar, whose health officials were left operating in an institutional vacuum, \ndisconnected from both their superiors and from the elected representatives of their target \npopulation.  In such a context, it is not surprising that their performance was indifferent \nand unresponsive.  These findings echo Chaudhury (2006), who finds that Gonoshasthaya \nKendra\u2019s remarkable success in improving basic health care indicators in its target \npopulation is largely due to the upwards and downwards accountability that it is able to \ngenerate. \n This high level of involvement and oversight on behalf of the people was \nreflected in the attitudes and behaviors of the people themselves.  We found Saturia\u2019s \ncitizens extensively involved with the delivery of health services in their upazila.  \nInterviews and direct observation uncovered regular and intense interactions between \nhealth workers and community people in Saturia.  As a result, health workers in Saturia \nwere able to maintain quite close relationships with the people they were meant to serve, \nand involved them closely in decision-making.  By contrast, ordinary people in Rajnagar \nwere kept at arm\u2019s length by their authorities.  Popular involvement in health service \nplanning and delivery was low to nonexistent, leaving citizens less informed about local \nproblems and unmobilized for their solution. \n 20\n One would expect a population with more vigorous, active institutions, and higher \nquality and more responsive public services, to hold different ideas and attitudes about \nthese services, and to demand them more.  And this is in fact the case.  In Saturia, men \nnow encourage women to participate in health programs and immunization drives, as one \nNGO worker testified.  Social norms do not intervene, as a focus group participant \npointed out:  \n\u201cWomen can go to the hospital alone if required.  Nobody minds about pregnant \nmothers receiving vaccines or about women using birth control.  Because it has now \nbeen accepted by all \u2013 rich and poor alike.  Husband and wife take these decisions \ntogether.  All now realize that having more children is the cause of poverty.\u201d \nThis situation is all the more remarkable for the change it marks with the status \nquo ante in Saturia.  In earlier times there were many superstitions, especially regarding \nmaternal health.  But now attitudes have changed.  People no longer resist or delay \nmedical intervention when a pregnant mother is sick, but immediately seek assistance \nfrom a doctor or health center.  \u201cIt was not like this ten years ago,\u201d a respondent \nobserved.  \u201cThe changes are due to the rising rate of education, and to awareness \nprograms broadcast on radio and television, and also by health workers.\u201d \nThese new attitudes and dispositions operate not just at the individual level, but at \nthe group level as well.  \u201cWe all are aware,\u201d declared one woman. \n\u201cWe share our experiences regarding maternal health issues among ourselves, and \nalso try to take care of each other.  For example, when I become pregnant then my \nsister-in-law (nanod) takes care of me.  On the other hand, when she becomes \npregnant I take care of her.  Our husbands are also aware.\u201d \n 21\nIn this way, attitudes conducive to better health, and the information on which they are \nbased, are reinforced in the population.  New ideas circulate, and new standards of health \ncare are adopted by the group, which can then mobilize its efforts in aid of a needy \nmembers, further reinforcing the importance of medical care.  As Bourdieu, Brett \n(Forthcoming) and others have pointed out, institutions do not operate in a psychological \nvacuum, but rather rely on attitudes and dispositions compatible with their core ideas.  In \nSaturia, health-compatible attitudes are reinforced by a dense web of social and \ninstitutional relationships.  In a similar vein, Chaudhury (2006) attributes GK\u2019s success to \nthe way it anchors its health programs in the local community, relying on village workers \nand natural authorities, and so exploiting the local knowledge and credibility\/authority \nthat they enjoy.  It is significant that BRAC, another large NGO with notable success in \nthe health sector, uses a similar model (BRAC 2005). \n Such relationships unfortunately do not exist in Rajnagar.  And as a result, local \nideas and attitudes towards health care are conducive to poor health.  Contraceptive use is \nlower, and faith in traditional and spiritual healers much more apparent than in Saturia.  \nWitness one villager\u2019s comment on ante-natal care: \n\u201cPregnant mothers are given some tablets by family planning workers.  But the \nproblem is, when mothers take those tablets, the baby becomes unusually healthy.  \nAs a result, child delivery is not possible without surgery.  So we do not like to give \nmothers those free tablets provided by the government.  Another problem is that a \nmother cannot conceive more than three times if the delivery is with surgery.\u201d \nEven in the home, special foods and nutritional supplements are spurned in \nRajnagar, as families choose instead to rely on their normal daily diets.  Visits to health \ncenters and medical staff are avoided by villagers who shun pre-birth medical tests.  \n 22\nHence pregnant women requiring interventions tend to arrive at the UHC in a near-\ncritical state.  Thus another respondent: \n\u201cMany people do not care about the health condition of pregnant mothers.  In a house \nnearby a pregnant mother once became sick.  Her husband was abroad at that time, \nand her guardians did not want to take her to the doctor.  As a result, that mother had \nto suffer for a long time, and the guardians ended up spending thousands of taka for \nher treatment.\u201d \nIn some villages, pregnant women are not allowed to venture outside the house even if \ngravely ill.  And in most cases mothers must be accompanied by a close male family \nmember.  Some evidence suggests that such attitudes are beginning to change in \nRajnagar.  But the change is painfully slow. \n So the attitudes, and the personal and institutional relationships, that characterize \neach district are significantly and systematically different.  What explains such \ndifferences?  In our view, these differences are largely a product of the districts\u2019 history \nand geography.  First, consider geography.  Saturia is some 50 km west of Dhaka, and \nwell connected to it by good-quality transport, telecommunication and media links, as \nwell as dense networks of personal and professional contacts.  The last is the most \nimportant.  Saturians can easily commute to work in Dhaka, while officials, academics, \nand NGO professionals from Dhaka can \u2013 and often do \u2013 take day trips to Saturia, often \nin search of a more \u201ctypical\u201d (i.e. ex-Dhaka) Bangladeshi context for studies, fact-finding \nmissions, pilot projects, etc.  Hence the presence of Dhakan ideas, attitudes, and \ndispositions is quite apparent in Saturia. \nNone of this is true of Rajnagar, which lies some 300 km northeast of Dhaka.  \nAccess to Dhaka is typically by long road trip, or air plus road travel via Sylhet.  Regular \n 23\ncontacts with Dhaka are accordingly fewer and less intense.  Rajnagar is located where \nthe Bangladeshi plain meets the northeastern foothills, producing a terrain quite different \nfrom the rest of the country.  Residents report feeling \u201cisolated\u201d from the capital, and \n\u201cspecial\u201d within Bangladesh.  Such feelings inform both their identity and behavior. \n The question of proximity to Dhaka is important because the capital is the \npolitical, economic, and intellectual nerve-center of the country.  The Bangladeshi state is \nhighly centralized, with power, resources and authority concentrated in the center.  Not \nonly are most policy decisions of importance made there, but most private sector firms \nand NGOs are either based there or controlled from there.  The city boasts the best \neducational institutions and the most modern health facilities \u2013 indeed, the highest quality \nof public and private services in the country generally.  It is also by far the place best \nconnected to the outside world.  It is richer, more knowledgeable, and more sophisticated \nthan the rest of the country.  Thus we can expect districts that are close and well-\nconnected to Dhaka to more easily mirror the attitudes and behaviors first adopted there, \ncompared to districts that are farther removed. \n Second, Rajnagar is more religiously conservative and observant than Saturia, and \nthis is largely due to its history.  In 1303 a messianic Muslim saint from Mecca, Hazrat \nShah Jalal, arrived in the Sylhet region, of which Rajnagar is a part, where he helped \ndefeat the local ruler.  With the aid of 360 companions, including several others who \nwould be sainted, he spread Islam throughout the region before dying in Sylhet around \n1350.  Sylhet became a center of Islam in Bengal.  Shah Jalal\u2019s shrine in the main \nmosque complex, which houses his swords and robes, is highly revered, and a holy \ndestination for pilgrims from across Bangladesh and South Asia. \n 24\nAttempting to locate the cause of modern social phenomena in the mists of time \nis, in the best of circumstances, a tricky enterprise.  But it is reasonable to infer that the \nexample of conservative, militant Islam championed by a local saint, and the everyday \npresence of his shrine as a place of veneration and pilgrimage, reinforce a conservative \nreligious orthodoxy in Rajnagar (and Sylhet more broadly), in a way that simply has no \nparallel in Saturia.  That is to say, Rajnagar\u2019s streak of religious orthodoxy may or may \nnot have begun with Shah Jalal.  But however initiated, the history and architecture of \nsainthood that he established in Sylhet, which thrive to this day, serve to reinforce \northodoxy, and all the ideas and behaviors associated with it (Ahamed and Nazneen \n1990).  Hence Rajnagar\u2019s women are not allowed to venture out of doors unaccompanied, \nmodern medicine is suspect, and women have much less power to make important \ndecisions about their lives than in Saturia.  Such ideas and behaviors \u2013 as we have seen \nabove \u2013 help to drive Rajnagar\u2019s inferior social development outcomes. \nThe third important factor is a combination of geography and history: Saturia has \na much higher intensity of NGO interventions than Rajnagar, and this has been sustained \nover several decades.  Since the 1970s, NGOs have played a significant role in raising \nawareness amongst women and the rural poor in Bangladesh, changing attitudes towards \neducation and health care, and fomenting participation and economic empowerment.  As \na result, Saturian women are informed about, seek, and even participate in the provision \nof education, maternal and child health care, and birth control, to name three key \nservices.  A large share of Saturian men have benefited from economic empowerment, \nand household income earning activities \u2013 such as pottery-making, weaving, and the \npreservation and transformation of foods for market \u2013 are commonplace.  None of this is \n 25\ntrue of Rajnagar.  The greater presence of NGOs in Saturia is probably due, once again, \nto its proximity to Dhaka.  But it is the persistence of this NGO intensity over decades \nthat has permitted their interventions to transcend the building of facilities and skills, and \nreach the deeper beliefs and behaviors of the population. \n In summary, we have two upazilas with similar local government administrations, \nsimilar health service administrations, similar infrastructure and equipment, and similarly \nqualified staff employed by a common central ministry.  But these assets and personnel \nwere deployed in very different ways, resulting in high variation of service, and \nsignificantly different social outcomes.  Why?  The answer lies in the deep changes in \nunderstandings and dispositions amongst Saturians towards the value of health care (and \nother primary services).  These are a product of the rising education levels documented in \nsection 1, plus the promotion by public authorities of a primary health care model \nimplemented at the district, upazila, and union parishad levels.  These elements combined \nto make Saturians seek out modern health care, and take a greater interest in its effective \nprovision.  Which, in turn, imposed greater constraints of accountability on public health \nofficials.  There is considerable evidence that similar dynamics, not documented here, \nhave taken place in the education and water sectors, and with respect to local government \nmore generally. \nBut improvements in education, and the roll-out of a primary health care model, are \nnational phenomena in Bangladesh.  Why did they combine to promote change in Saturia \nbut not Rajnagar?  Because in Saturia such advances were like seeds planted in an \ninstitutional soil that nourished them and allowed them to take root.  This \u201csoil\u201d consists \nof a dense web of relationships between citizens, their natural and legal authorities, and \n 26\nservice providers, that enmeshed these advances \u2013 and the reformers who drove advances \nforward \u2013 in local systems of authority and legitimacy.  This strengthened both reforms \nand reformers, and made society more susceptible to change.  Saturia\u2019s institutional soil \nwas prepared and made fertile by its proximity to the capital, its history of sustained \nNGO involvement, and a relatively open, tolerant religious tradition.  In Rajnagar, by \ncontrast, similar institutional underpinnings were missing.  Citizens felt less empowered, \nand less connected to their authorities.  The seeds of change fell on soil made barren by \nhistory and geography, and social development stalled. \n5. Conclusions \nIt is tempting to attribute differences in behavior, and hence outcomes, between \nSaturia and Rajnagar to simple exogenous cultural \u2013 especially religious \u2013 factors.  To be \nsure, Rajnagar is more religiously traditional and conservative than Saturia, and this \ncontributes importantly to how women are treated there.  But our reading of the evidence \nis that much more of the micro-level variation between the two upazilas can be explained \nvia an analysis that enmeshes Saturia\u2019s service delivery model in a web of local \nrelationships and interactions that impose binding upwards and downwards \naccountability on her health providers. \nIf services are to respond to a population\u2019s particular \u2013 and changing \u2013 needs, and \nbe credible in the eyes of the population, then the elected representatives of that \npopulation should be involved in their production.  They should have a degree of voice, \nor other leverage, over the way those services are provided, including the application of \npositive and negative incentives to directly responsible staff.  Of course, such \nrepresentatives must themselves be the product of elections that are free, fair and \n 27\ntransparent if they are to have credibility and act with moral weight.  They use their \nmoral weight to communicate community problems and expectations upwards to service \nproviders and their superiors, as well as the substance of policy reforms and their \nmotivations downwards to the grass-roots.  In this way, not only are specific policies \nmade credible in the eyes of the people, but the changes in social behavior that underpin \nprogress can begin to occur. \nPerhaps the more important point is that history and geography are given, but \nquestions surrounding the institutional basis of service provision are patently susceptible \nto reform, as the case of Saturia shows, and hence are the proper object of policy.  And so \nwhen confronting the failures of health care in Bangladesh, we do well to ask ourselves \nnot how conservative are her Muslims, but rather what are the institutional foundations of \nsuccess in Saturia, and how can they be replicated not only in Rajnagar but throughout \nthe country.  This is because a number of the behavioral traits we think of as \u201ccultural\u201d, \nand hence exogenous to policy analysis, are in fact sustained by particular institutions, \nand can thus be transformed by institutional reform. \nConsider how the two upazilas treat their pregnant women.  Rajnagar\u2019s are kept \nindoors and discouraged from visiting health workers, regardless of the sickness, \nsuffering, and death this causes.  But Saturia\u2019s are free to leave the house \nunaccompanied, and encouraged to seek medical attention by family and friends far more \nknowledgeable about the health consequences of their actions than their similars in \nRajnagar.  Is this difference a cultural one?  A religious one?  Without doubt Rajnagar\u2019s \nsocial mores are affected by its religious orthodoxy, which is itself deeply embedded in \n 28\nthe region\u2019s history and identity.  But history is not destiny.  As for any municipality \nanywhere, Rajnagar\u2019s history determines its initial conditions, not its trajectory. \nIndeed, until recently, such initial conditions were largely shared by Saturia.  \u201cIt \nwas not like this ten years ago,\u201d a resident of Saturia reminds us, but then things changed.  \nChange came through an \u2018Evans-esque\u2019 synergy of NGOs\u2019 educational and \nempowerment programs, the efforts of public health and education workers, and \ncontinuous exposure to the attitudes and practices of the capital.  Success took the form \nof the production of an institutional framework that enmeshed reformers and their efforts \nin a dense web of relationships that both strengthened their actions and made local \nsociety more susceptible to their message.  Exogenous factors such as history and \ngeography contributed much to the production of this institutional framework.  But so did \nthe directed efforts of reformers such as NGO workers, public sector professionals, and \nlocal leaders, who set out to change things.  And change they did \u2013 Saturia\u2019s \u201ccultural\u201d \nbehaviors changed, its people became healthier, and its women more free. \nOur \u201ctale of two upazilas\u201d provides another, broad lesson about the importance of \nstrong micro foundations for the study of local government.  It is notable that a common \nlegal and administrative framework produced such disparate outcomes in Saturia and \nRajnagar.  This implies that their success and failure have little to do with the laws, \npolicies, and other national characteristics of Bangladesh, and much to do with the local \nincentives and patterns of interaction that foment involvement by, and accountability to, \nthe public, or not.  This suggests that studies that attempt national-level evaluations of \ndecentralization start out with the wrong question.  Decentralization is not a policy \nprescription that produces discrete national results to be measured and parameterized, as \n 29\nmuch of the existing literature seems to assume.  It is, rather, a process of letting go by \nthe center that looses as many independent, idiosyncratic dynamics as there are local \ngovernments in a country.  Decentralization does not produce a limited number of good \nor bad outcomes; it produces a large number of good outcomes, and a large number of \nbad outcomes.  The simplest question that can be asked is: How do the good and the bad \ncompare?  The more interesting questions are: What makes the good good?  And how do \nwe make the bad good?  This requires that we study local government reforms as local, \nand not national, phenomena, and focus analytically on the institutions, actors, and \ndynamics that comprise the local political economy.  Only by resisting the temptation to \naggregate can we hope to understand how decentralization works, and how to make it \nwork better. \n \nMethodological Annex \nQuantitative and qualitative research methods have been applied to collect data from a \nvariety of respondents.  The categories of respondents include: (i) government health \nfacilities at upazila, union and community levels; (ii) health service providers (i.e., \ndoctors and other medically trained persons) of upazila, union and community level \nhealth facilities; (iii) patients of upazila, union and community level health facilities, \nincluding in-patients of upazila health facilities; (iv) selected households of selected \nvillages; (v) selected male and female members of the villages; and (vi) selected \nindividuals (knowledgeable and articulate) from in and around the selected villages.  The \ninstruments used for data collection include structured questionnaires for both patients of \nhealth facilities and households, semi-structured interview schedules for health providers \n 30\nand others, checklists for focus group discussions, and observation checklists for the \nhealth facilities.  Structured questionnaires include the socio-economic and demographic \nbackground of patients and the households, health status and health seeking behavior, and \nservice delivery issues, among others.  Interview schedules focused on service delivery \nissues, the attitudes and behaviors of health providers, and the knowledge, attitude, \nculture and practices of people living in the area.  Focus group checklists also included \nissues related to health care practices and service delivery issues.  Observation checklists \nincluded physical facilities, utilities, hygiene condition, staff, quality of services, etc. \nCase Selection \nTwo upazilas were selected purposively based on their performances in reducing \nmaternal and infant mortality over the past years \u2013 one being the over-achiever in \nreducing maternal and child mortality, and the other being the under-achiever.   Before \nselecting the upazilas, two districts were selected to ease the selection of the upazilas.  \nThe selection of the districts was made based on Sen and Ali (2005), where some of the \ndistricts emerged either as over-achievers or under-achievers with respect to \nBangladesh\u2019s MDGs.  On this basis, Manikganj was selected as the overachiever with \nrespect to maternal and child mortality, and Moulvibazar was selected as the \nunderachiever.  Data were then collected from district civil surgeon and family planning \noffices about certain reproductive and child health indicators for all the upazilas of both \nthe selected districts.  Based on that information, the upazilas of each district were ranked \naccording to performance.  Selection of upazilas was then based on extremes of \nperformance within each district, leading us to Saturia upazila in Manikganj district, and \nRajnagar upazila in Moulvibazar district. \n 31\nWith respect to government health facilities, three health facilities were selected \nfor investigation from each of the upazilas.  They are: the Upazila Health Complex \n(UHC); one Union Health and Family Welfare Center (UHFWC); and one Satellite Clinic \n(SC).  Selection of the UHC was straightforward, as each of the upazilas has one such \nhealth complex.  Selection of the UHFWC was random from amongst those centers that \nare at least eight kilometers away from the UHC and similar facilities.  Satellite Clinics \nwere selected from within the catchment areas of the UHFWC.  Selection at this stage \nwas again random, but from within those Clinics that are at least five kilometers away \nfrom the UHFWC. \n \n \nBibliography \nAhamed, E. and D.R.J.A.

See Bardhan (2001). \n5 All of the statistics in this section come from original fieldwork, as detailed in the methodological annex. \n6 One decimal equals 1\/100th acre. \n7 This is notional because such a low-frequency phenomenon as maternal mortality requires a larger sample \nor longer time frame for accurate calculation. \n8 Two important indicators in their own right that are sometimes used as proxies for broader social \ndevelopment.  See for example Boone and Faguet (1998). \n9 Unions visited were Munshibazar in Rajnagar and Dhankora in Saturia. \n10 A union parishad usually covers several villages. \n \n \n 42\n"}
