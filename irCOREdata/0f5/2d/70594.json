We describe the weak localization correction to conductivity in ultra-\nthin graphene \ufb01lms, taking into account disorder scattering and the in\ufb02uence of\ntrigonal warping of the Fermi surface. A possible manifestation of the chiral nature\nof electrons in the localization properties is hampered by trigonal warping, result-\ning in a suppression of the weak anti-localization e\ufb00ect in monolayer graphene and\nof weak localization in bilayer graphene. Intervalley scattering due to atomically\nsharp scatterers in a realistic graphene sheet or by edges in a narrow wire tends\nto restore weak localization and conventional negative magnetoresistance in both\nmaterials.\n1 Introduction\nThe chiral nature of quasiparticles in ultra-thin graphitic \ufb01lms [1\u20135] recently revealed in Shub-\nnikov de Haas and quantum Hall e\ufb00ect measurements [6\u20139] originates from the hexagonal\nlattice structure of a monolayer of graphite (graphene). The low energy behavior of monolayer\ngraphene is explained in terms of two valleys of Dirac-like chiral quasiparticles with \u2018isospin\u2019\nlinked to the momentum direction, exhibiting Berry phase \u03c0 [1\u20134]. Remarkably, the dominant\nlow energy quasiparticles in a bilayer are di\ufb00erent: massive chiral quasiparticles with a parabolic\ndispersion and Berry phase 2\u03c0 [5].\nIn existing graphene structures, scattering occurs predominantly from potential perturba-\ntions which are smooth on the scale of the lattice constant a. This smooth potential arises\nfrom charges located in the substrate at a distance d from the 2D sheet, a \u226a d < h\/pF (h\/pF\nbeing the Fermi wavelength). Such a smooth potential is unable to change the isospin of chiral\nelectrons so that, in a monolayer, there is a complete suppression of electron backscattering\nfrom potential disorder [4,10]. In the theory of quantum transport in disordered systems [11]\nthe suppression of backscattering is known as the anti-localization (WAL) e\ufb00ect [12] and, in\nmonolayer graphene with purely potential scattering, a possible WAL behavior of conductivity\n[10,13\u201315] has been related to the Berry phase \u03c0 speci\ufb01c to the Dirac-like Hamiltonian. Owing\nto the di\ufb00erent degree of chirality in bilayer graphene, related to Berry phase 2\u03c0 [5], purely\npotential scattering would have a di\ufb00erent e\ufb00ect: no suppression of backscattering leading to\nconventional weak localization (WL) [14,16].\na e-mail: k.kechedzhi@lancaster.ac.uk2 Will be inserted by the editor\nB i B   ~   t B\n- 1\nt B   ~   t *\nt B   ~   t i\n0\nr\n(\nB\n)\n \n-\n \nr\n(\n0\n)\nFig. 1. Typical magnetoresistance behavior expected in a phase-coherent monolayer of graphene for a\nweak intervalley scattering, \u03c4\u2217 \u226a \u03c4i (solid line) and for the case when the symmetry-breaking intravalley\nscattering is slower than the intervalley one \u03c4\u2217 \u226b \u03c4i (dashed). In both cases, we assume that the phase\ncoherence time determines the longest relaxation time scale in the system.\nIn realistic graphene, there are other considerations that appear, at \ufb01rst glance, to be merely\nsmall perturbations to this picture, but they have a profound impact on the localization proper-\nties if their e\ufb00ect is perceptible on length scales less that the phase coherence length. Examples\ninclude intravalley scattering processes that do not conserve isospin [10,13\u201315] and trigonal\nwarping of the electronic band structure which introduces asymmetry in the shape of the Fermi\nsurface about each valley [4,15,16]. Both of them tend to destroy the manifestation of chiral-\nity in the localization properties, resulting in a suppression of the WAL e\ufb00ect in monolayer\ngraphene [17] and of WL in bilayers [18]. Moreover, owing to the inverted chirality of quasipar-\nticles in the two valleys, intervalley scattering will wash out any Berry phase e\ufb00ect and restore\nconventional weak localization (WL) behavior of electrons in both monolayers and bilayers in\nthe regime of long-lasting phase coherence [10,13\u201319].\nTwo typical magnetoresistance curves for monolayer graphene are sketched in Fig. 1. They\nillustrate two extremes: \u03c4\u22121\n\u2217 \u226a \u03c4\n\u22121\ni and \u03c4\u22121\n\u2217 \u226b \u03c4\n\u22121\ni where \u03c4\n\u22121\ni is the intervalley scattering\nrate and \u03c4\u22121\n\u2217 is the combined scattering rate of intravalley and intervalley scattering and of\ntrigonal warping. When \u03c4\u22121\n\u2217 \u226a \u03c4\n\u22121\ni , the magnetoresistance \u03c1(B) \u2212 \u03c1(0) changes sign at the\n\ufb01eld Bi such that \u03c4B \u223c \u03c4i: from negative at B < Bi to positive at higher \ufb01elds. This behavior\nresembles the low-to-high \ufb01eld crossover in the quantum correction to the conductivity of metals\nwith strong spin-orbit coupling, though with an inverted sign of the e\ufb00ect. In the case of\n\u03c4\u22121\n\u2217 \u226b \u03c4\n\u22121\ni , the magnetoresistance is typically of a WL type, with almost no sign of anti-\nlocalization up to the highest \ufb01elds, which shows that, unlike in a ballistic regime or a quantizing\nmagnetic \ufb01eld [3,5,20], the chiral nature of quasiparticles does not manifest itself in the weak\n\ufb01eld magnetoresistance of realistic graphene structures.\nThe WL behavior in graphene is novel because, with the exception of spin-orbit coupling\n[12,21], qualitative features of WL do not usually depend on the detail of the electronic band\nstructure and crystalline symmetry. In gapful multi-valley semiconductors only the size of WL\ne\ufb00ect may depend on the number of valleys and the strength of intervalley scattering [22\u201324].\nThe low-\ufb01eld MR,  \u03c1(B) \u2261 \u03c1(B) \u2212 \u03c1(0), in a two dimensional electron gas or a thin metallic\n\ufb01lm [25,11,12,22] in the absence of spin-orbit coupling is characterized by\n \u03c1(B) = \u2212\ns\u03b8e2\u03c12\n2\u03c0h\nF\n \nB\nB\u03d5\n \n, B\u03d5 =\n\u00af hc\n4De\n\u03c4\u22121\n\u03d5 .\nHere F(z) = lnz + \u03c8(1\n2 + 1\nz), \u03c4\u03d5 is the coherence time, D is the di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient, and the\ninteger factor s\u03b8 depends on whether or not states in nv valleys are mixed by disorder. This\nfactor is controlled by the ratio \u03b8 = \u03c4i\/\u03c4\u03d5 between the intervalley scattering time \u03c4i and the\ncoherence time \u03c4\u03d5. In materials such as Mg, ZnO, Si, Ge, listed in Table I, where each of the\nFermi surface pockets is p \u2192 \u2212p symmetric, intervalley scattering reduces the size of the WL\nMR from that described by s\u221e = 2nv when \u03b8 = \u03c4i\/\u03c4\u03d5 \u226b 1 to s0 = 2 for \u03b8 \u226a 1.\nA more interesting scenario develops in a multi-valley semimetal, where the localization\nproperties can be in\ufb02uenced by the absence of p \u2192 \u2212p symmetry of the electronic dispersionWill be inserted by the editor 3\nTable 1.

Here, we demonstrate\nhow the asymmetry in the shape of the Fermi surface in each of its two valleys determines\nthe observable WL behavior sketched in Fig. 1. It has a tendency opposite to that known in\nusual semiconductors and metals: a complete absence of WL MR for in\ufb01nite \u03c4i (s\u221e = 0) and\nthe standard WL e\ufb00ect in the limit of \u03c4i \u226a \u03c4\u03d5 (s0 = 2). In Section 2 we describe the WL\ne\ufb00ect in monolayer graphene with a description of the low energy Hamiltonian in Section 2.1,\na qualitative account of interference e\ufb00ects in Section 2.2, the model of disorder in Section 2.3,\nan account of our diagrammatic calculation of the weak localization correction in Section 2.4\nand the resulting magnetoresistance in Section 2.5. Section 3 describes the weak localization\ncorrection and magnetoresistance in bilayer graphene.\n2 Weak localization magnetoresistance in disordered monolayer graphene\n2.1 Low energy Hamiltonian of clean monolayer graphene\nThe hexagonal lattice of monolayer graphene contains two non-equivalent sites A and B in the\nunit cell, as shown in Fig. 2. The Fermi level in a neutral graphene sheet is pinned near the\ncorners of the hexagonal Brillouin zone with wave vectors K\u00b1 = \u00b1(2\n3ha\u22121,0) where a is the\nlattice constant. The Brillouin zone corners K\u00b1 determine two non-equivalent valleys in the\nquasiparticle spectrum described by the Hamiltonian [28,1,4,15],\n\u02c6 H1 = v\u03a0z (\u03c3xpx + \u03c3ypy) + \u02c6 h1w, (1)\n\u02c6 h1w =  \u03a00\n \n\u03c3y (pxpy + pypx) \u2212 \u03c3x\n \np2\nx \u2212 p2\ny\n  \n.\nThis Hamiltonian operates in the space of four-component wave functions, \u03a6 = [\u03c6K+(A),\u03c6K+(B),\n\u03c6K\u2212(B),\u03c6K\u2212(A)] describing electronic amplitudes on A and B sites and in the valleys K\u00b1. Here,\nwe use a direct product of \u2018isospin\u2019 (AB lattice space) matrices \u03c30 \u2261 \u02c6 1,\u03c3x,y,z and \u2018pseudospin\u2019\ninter\/intra-valley matrices \u03a00 \u2261 \u02c6 1,\u03a0x,y,z to highlight the di\ufb00erence between the form of \u02c6 H1\nin the non-equivalent valleys. The Hamiltonian \u02c6 H1 takes into account nearest neighbor A\/B\nhopping in the plane with the \ufb01rst (second) term representing the \ufb01rst (second) order term in\nan expansion with respect to momentum p measured from the center of the valley K\u00b1.\nNear the center of the valley K+, the Dirac-type part, v \u03c3   p, of \u02c6 H1 determines the linear\ndispersion \u01eb = vp for the electron and \u01eb = \u2212vp for holes, where the electron and hole states also\ndi\ufb00er by the isospin projection onto the direction of their momentum (chirality): \u03c3   p\/p = 1,\nholes \u03c3  p\/p = \u22121. In the valley K\u2212, the electron and hole chirality is mirror-re\ufb02ected: it \ufb01xes\n\u03c3   p\/p = \u22121 for electrons and \u03c3   p\/p = 1 for holes.

The angular dependence w(\u03d5) \u223c cos2(\u03d5\/2) of the\nscattering probability o\ufb00 a short range potential which conserves isospin is shown in Fig. 4(a).\nIt demonstrates the fact that the chiral states Eqs. (2,3) with isospin \ufb01xed to the direction of\nmomentum display an absence of back scattering [4,29,10], leading to a transport time longer\nthan the scattering time \u03c4tr = 2\u03c40.\nThe term \u02c6 h1w in Eq. (1) can be treated as a perturbation leading to a trigonal deformation\nof a single-connected Fermi line and p \u2192 \u2212p asymmetry of the electron dispersion inside each\nvalley illustrated in Fig. 3: \u01eb(K\u00b1,p)  = \u01eb(K\u00b1,\u2212p). However, due to time-reversal symmetry\n[30] trigonal warping has opposite signs in the two valleys and \u01eb(K\u00b1,p) = \u01eb(K\u2213,\u2212p). The\ninterplay between the two terms in \u02c6 H1 resulting in the asymmetry of the electronic dispersion\nmanifest itself in the WL behavior.\n2.2 Interference of electronic waves in monolayer graphene\nThe WL correction to conductivity in disordered conductors is a result of the constructive\ninterference of electrons propagating around closed loops in opposite directions [11] as shown\nin Fig. 4(b). Such interference is usually constructive in materials without spin-orbit coupling,\nsince electrons acquire exactly the same phase when travelling along two time-reversed tra-\njectories. WL is usually described [11] in terms of the particle-particle correlation function,\nCooperon.\nFollowing the example of Cooperons for a spin 1\n2, we classify Cooperons as singlets and\ntriplets in terms of \u2018isospin\u2019 (AB lattice space) and \u2018pseudospin\u2019 (inter\/intra-valley) indices\n(see Section 2.1). In fact, with regards to the isospin (sublattice) composition of Cooperons in\na disordered monolayer, only singlet modes are relevant. This is because a correlator describing\ntwo plane waves, \u03a6K+,p and \u03a6K\u2212,\u2212p Eqs. (2,3), propagating in opposite directions along a\nballistic segment of a closed trajectory as in Fig. 4(b) has the following form:\n\u03a6K,p\u03a6K\u2032,\u2212p \u223c | \u2191 K,p| \u2193 K\u2032,\u2212p \u2212 | \u2193 K,p| \u2191 K\u2032,\u2212p \u2212 e\u2212i\u03d5| \u2191 K,p| \u2191 K\u2032,\u2212p + ei\u03d5| \u2193 K,p| \u2193 K\u2032,\u2212p.\nIt contains only sublattice-singlet terms (the \ufb01rst two terms) because triplet terms (the last\ntwo terms) disappear after averaging over the direction of momentum,  e\u00b1i\u03d5 \u03d5 = 0. In fact,\nour diagrammatic calculation described in Section 2.4 shows that the interference correction to\nthe conductivity of graphene is determined by the interplay of four isospin singlet modes: one\npseudospin singlet and three pseudospin triplets. Of these, two of the pseudospin triplet modes\nare intravalley Cooperons while the remaining triplet and the singlet are intervalley Cooperons.Will be inserted by the editor 5\nK + K -\ne ( K - , p ) = e ( K - , - p ) e ( K + , p ) = e ( K + , - p )\ne ( K - , p ) = e ( K + , - p )\np\nFig. 3. Fermi lines (solid lines) in the vicinity of two inequivalent valleys K+ and K\u2212 of the hexagonal\nBrillouin zone (dashed line). Trigonal warping produces asymmetry of the dispersion at each valley\n\u01eb(K\u00b1,p)  = \u01eb(K\u00b1,\u2212p), where momentum p is determined with respect to the center of the valley, but\nthe e\ufb00ects of warping in the valleys have opposite signs, \u01eb(K\u00b1,p) = \u01eb(K\u2213,\u2212p).\nIn the WL picture for a di\ufb00usive electron in a metal, two phases \u03d11 and \u03d12 acquired while\npropagating along paths \u201d1\u201d and \u201d2\u201d [see Fig. 4(b)] are exactly equal, so that the interference\nof such paths is constructive and, as a result, enhances backscattering leading to WL [11]. In\nmonolayer graphene the Berry phase \u03c0 characteristic for quasi-particles described by the \ufb01rst\nterm of \u02c6 H1, determines the phase di\ufb00erence \u03b4 \u2261 \u03d11\u2212\u03d12 = \u03c0N (where N is the winding number\nof a trajectory) [10,15], and one would expect weak anti-localization behavior. However, the\nasymmetry of the electron dispersion due to \u02c6 h1w, leading to warping of the Fermi line around\neach valley as in Fig. 3, deviates \u03b4 from \u03c0N. Indeed, any closed trajectory is a combination\nof ballistic intervals, Fig. 4(b). Each interval, characterized by the momenta \u00b1pj (for the two\ndirections) and by its duration tj, contributes to the phase di\ufb00erence \u03b4j = [\u01eb(pj)\u2212\u01eb(\u2212pj)]tj =\n\u02c6 h1w(pj)tj. Since \u03b4j are random uncorrelated, the mean square of \u03b4 =\n \n\u03b4j can be estimated as\n \u03b42  \u223c  (tj\u02c6 h1w(pj))2 t\/\u03c4tr, where t is the duration of the path and \u03c4tr is the transport mean\nfree time. Warping thus determines the relaxation rate,\n\u03c4\u22121\nw \u223c  Tr\u02c6 h2\n1w(p) \u03d5, (4)\nwhich suppresses the two intravalley Cooperons, and, thus, weak anti-localization in the case\nwhen electrons seldom change their valley state. The two intervalley Cooperons are not a\ufb00ected\nby trigonal warping due to time-reversal symmetry of the system which requires \u01eb(K\u00b1,p) =\n\u01eb(K\u2213,\u2212p), Fig. 3. These two Cooperons cancel each other in the case of weak intervalley\nscattering, thus giving \u03b4g \u223c 0.

(13)\nHowever, since warping has an opposite e\ufb00ect on di\ufb00erent valleys, it does not lead to relaxation\nof the pseudospin-singlet C0\n0 or the intervalley component of the pseudospin triplet, Cz\n0.\nAltogether, the relaxation of modes Cl\n0 can be described by the following combinations of\nrates:\n\u03930\n0 = 0, \u0393z\n0 = 2\u03c4\n\u22121\ni , \u0393x\n0 = \u0393\ny\n0 = \u03c4\u22121\n\u2217 \u2261 \u03c4\u22121\nw + 2\u03c4\u22121\nz + \u03c4\n\u22121\ni , (14)\nwhere \u03c4\n\u22121\ni is the intervalley scattering rate (here we use the x \u2212 y plane isotropy of disorder,\n\u03c4\u22121\nsx = \u03c4\u22121\nsy \u2261 \u03c4\n\u22121\ns\u22a5 and \u03c4\n\u22121\nxl = \u03c4\n\u22121\nyl \u2261 \u03c4\n\u22121\n\u22a5l ),\n\u03c4\n\u22121\ni = 4\u03c4\n\u22121\n\u22a5\u22a5 + 2\u03c4\n\u22121\nz\u22a5, and \u03c4\u22121\nz = 2\u03c4\n\u22121\n\u22a5z + \u03c4\u22121\nzz .

(16)\n2.5 Weak localization magnetoresistance in monolayer graphene\nDue to the momentum-independent form of the current operator \u02dc v = 2v\u03a3, the WL correction\nto conductivity \u03b4g includes two additional diagrams, Fig. 5(e) and (f) besides the standard\ndiagram shown in Fig. 5(d). Each of the diagrams in Fig. 5(e) and (f) produces a contribution\nequal to (\u22121\n4) of that in Fig. 5(d). This partial cancellation, together with a factor of four from\nthe vertex corrections and a factor of two from spin degeneracy leads to\n\u03b4g =\n2e2D\n\u03c0\u00af h\n \nd2q\n(2\u03c0)\n2\n \nCx\n0 + C\ny\n0 + Cz\n0 \u2212 C0\n0\n \n. (17)\nUsing expression Eq. (17), we \ufb01nd the B = 0 temperature dependent correction, \u03b4\u03c1\/\u03c1 =\n\u2212\u03b4g\/g, to the graphene sheet resistance. Taking into account the double spin degeneracy of\ncarriers we present\n\u03b4\u03c1(0)\n\u03c12 = \u2212\ne2\n\u03c0h\n \nln(1 + 2\n\u03c4\u03d5\n\u03c4i\n) \u2212 2ln\n\u03c4\u03d5\/\u03c4tr\n1 +\n\u03c4\u03d5\n\u03c4\u2217\n \n, (18)\nand evaluate magnetoresistance, \u03c1(B) \u2212 \u03c1(0) \u2261  \u03c1(B),\n \u03c1(B) =\ne2\u03c12\n\u03c0h\n \nF(\nB\nB\u03d5\n) \u2212 F(\nB\nB\u03d5 + 2Bi\n) \u22122F(\nB\nB\u03d5 + B\u2217\n)\n \n, (19)\nF(z) = lnz + \u03c8(\n1\n2\n+\n1\nz\n), B\u03d5,i,\u2217 =\n\u00af hc\n4De\n\u03c4\n\u22121\n\u03d5,i,\u2217 .\nHere, \u03c8 is the digamma function and the decoherence (taken into account by the rate \u03c4\u22121\n\u03d5 )\ndetermines the curvature of the magnetoresistance at B < B\u03d5 \u2261 \u00af hc\/4De\u03c4\u03d5.\nThe last term in Eq. (17), C0\n0 is the only true gapless Cooperon mode which determines\nthe dominance of the WL sign in the quantum correction to the conductivity in graphene\nwith a long phase coherence time, \u03c4\u03d5 > \u03c4i. The two curves sketched in Fig. 1 illustrate the\ncorresponding MR in two limits: B\u2217 \u226a Bi (\u03c4\u2217 \u226b \u03c4i) and B\u2217 \u226b Bi (\u03c4\u2217 \u226a \u03c4i). In both cases,\nthe low-\ufb01eld MR (B \u226a Bi) is negative. If B\u2217 \u226a Bi, the MR changes sign:  \u03c1(B) < 0 at\nB < Bi \u2261 \u00af hc\/4De\u03c4i and  \u03c1(B) > 0 at higher \ufb01elds. For B\u2217 \u226b Bi, the MR is distinctly\nof a WL type, with almost no sign of WAL. Such behavior is expected in graphene tightly\ncoupled to the insulating substrate (which generates atomically sharp scatterers). In a sheet\nloosely attached to a substrate (or suspended), the intervalley scattering time may be longer\nthan the decoherence time, \u03c4i > \u03c4\u03d5 > \u03c4w (Bi < B\u03d5 < B\u2217). Hence Cz\n0 is e\ufb00ectively gapless,\nwhereas trigonal warping suppresses the modes Cx\n0 and C\ny\n0. In this case the contribution from\nCz\n0 cancels C0\n0, and the MR would display neither WL nor WAL behavior:  \u03c1(B) = 0. This\nagrees with the qualitative picture of WL behavior of monolayer graphene developed in Sec. ??.\n3 Bilayer graphene\n3.1 Low energy Hamiltonian of clean bilayer graphene\nBilayer graphene consists of two coupled monolayers. Its unit cell contains four inequivalent\nsites, A,B, \u02dc A and \u02dc B (A,B and \u02dc A, \u02dc B lie in the bottom and top layer, respectively) arranged\naccording to Bernal stacking [36,5]: sites B of the honeycomb lattice in the bottom layer lie\nexactly below \u02dc A of the top layer, Fig. 6. The Brillouin zone of the bilayer, similarly to theWill be inserted by the editor 11\nA\n~B\n~B ~B\nA\nA\na\nA~ , B\nFig. 6. Schematic of the bilayer lattice (bonds in the bottom layer A,B are indicated by solid lines\nand in the top layer \u02dc A, \u02dc B by dashed lines) containing four sites in the unit cell: A (white circles), \u02dc B\n(grey), \u02dc AB dimer (black).\none in monolayer, has two inequivalent degeneracy points K+ and K\u2212 which determine two\nvalleys centered around \u01eb = 0 in the electron spectrum [34]. Near the center of each valley\nthe electron spectrum consists of four branches. Two branches describing states on sublattices\n\u02dc A and B are split from energy \u01eb = 0 by about \u00b1\u03b31, the interlayer coupling, whereas two\nlow-energy branches are formed by states based upon sublattices A and \u02dc B. The latter can be\ndescribed [5] using the Hamiltonian, which acts in the space of four-component wave functions\n\u03a6 = [\u03c6K+,A,\u03c6K+, \u02dc B,\u03c6K\u2212, \u02dc B,\u03c6K\u2212,A], where \u03c6\u03be,\u03b1 is an electron amplitude on the sublattice \u03b1 =\nA, \u02dc B and in the valley \u03be = K+,K\u2212.\n\u02c6 H2L = \u2212\n1\n2m\n  \np2\nx \u2212 p2\ny\n \n\u03c3x + 2pxpy\u03c3y\n \n+ \u02c6 h2w, (20)\n\u02c6 h2w = v3\u03a0z (px\u03c3x \u2212 py\u03c3y).\nHere, \u03c3x,y,z and \u03a0x,y,z are Pauli matrices acting in sublattice and valley space, respectively.\nThe \ufb01rst term in Eq. (20) is the leading contribution in the nearest neighbors approximation\nof the tight binding model [5]. This approximation takes into account both intralayer hopping\nA \u2194 B and \u02dc A \u2194 \u02dc B (that leads to the Dirac-type dispersion \u01eb = \u00b1pv near the Fermi point K\u00b1\nin a monolayer) and the interlayer \u02dc A \u2194 B hopping. This term yields the parabolic spectrum\n\u01eb = \u00b1p2\/2m with m = \u03b31\/2v2 which dominates in the intermediate energy range 1\n4\u03b31(v3\/v)2 <\n\u03b5F < 1\n4\u03b31. In this regime we can truncate the expansion of \u02c6 H(p) in powers of the momentum p\nneglecting terms of the order higher than quadratic. Electron waves characteristic for the \ufb01rst,\nquadratic, term of \u02c6 H2L have the form\n\u03a6K,\u00b1p = \u00b1\ne\u00b1ipx\/\u00af h\n\u221a\n2\n \ne\u2212i\u03d5| \u2191 K,\u00b1p \u2212 ei\u03d5| \u2193 K,\u00b1p\n \n, (21)\nwhere | \u2191 K+,\u00b1p = [1,0,0,0], | \u2193 K+,\u00b1p = [0,1,0,0] and | \u2191 K\u2212,\u00b1p = [0,0,1,0], | \u2191 K\u2212,\u00b1p =\n[0,0,0,1]. These are eigenstates of an operator \u03c3n2 with \u03c3n2 = \u22121 for electrons and \u03c3n2 = 1\nfor holes, where n2(p) = (cos(2\u03d5),sin(2\u03d5)) for p = (pcos\u03d5,psin\u03d5), which means that they are\nchiral, but with the degree of chirality di\ufb00erent from the one found in monolayer (see Sec. 2.1).\nSuch electron waves are characterized by the Berry phase 2\u03c0, and the dependence w(\u03b8) \u223c cos2 \u03b8\nof the scattering probability o\ufb00 a short-range potential on the scattering angle \u03b8 =   pp\u2032 is such\nthat transport and scattering times in the bilayer coincide, although w(\u03b8) is anisotropic [see\nFig. 4(c)], and the Drude conductivity of a bilayer is g = 4e2n\u03c40\/m (in contrast to monolayer\ngraphene, see Sec. 2.1).\nThe second term in Eq. (20), \u02c6 h2w, originates from a weak direct A \u2194 \u02dc B interlayer coupling.\nIt leads to a Lifshitz transition in the shape of the Fermi line of the 2D electron gas which12 Will be inserted by the editor\ntakes place when \u01ebF \u223c \u01ebL \u2261 1\n4\u03b31(v3\/v)2. In a bilayer with \u01ebF < \u01ebL, the interplay between the\ntwo terms in \u02c6 H2L determines the Fermi line in the form of four pockets [5] in each valley. In a\nbilayer with \u01ebF > \u01ebL, \u02c6 h2w can be treated as a perturbation leading to a trigonal deformation of\na single-connected Fermi line, thus manifesting the asymmetry of the electron dispersion inside\neach valley: \u01eb(K\u00b1,p)  = \u01eb(K\u00b1,\u2212p). This asymmetry leads to the dephasing e\ufb00ect of electron\ntrajectories similar to the one discussed in the case of monolayer, and is characterized by the\nscattering rate \u03c4\u22121\nw Eq. (4).\n3.2 Interference of electronic waves in bilayer graphene\nTo analyze the WL e\ufb00ect we introduce Cooperon matrix C\n\u03be \u03be\n\u2032 \n\u2032\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u2032\u03b2\u2032 where subscripts describe the\nsublattice state of incoming \u03b1\u03b2 and outgoing \u03b1\u2032\u03b2\u2032 pairs of electrons and superscripts describe\nthe valley state of incoming \u03be  and outgoing \u03be\u2032 \u2032 pairs. Note that in contrast to monolayer we do\nnot rewrite the bilayer Hamiltonian in terms of \u03a3 and \u039b matrices. We parametrize Cooperons\nas C\nM1M2\nS1S2 by M1,M2 \u201dvalley\u201d and S1,S2 \u201dsublattice\u201d singlet and triplet states in a similar\nway to monolayer isospin and pseudospin states. The sublattice composition of Cooperons is\ndetermined by the correlator of plane waves propagating ballistically in opposite directions,\n\u03a6K,p\u03a6K\u2032,\u2212p\u223c| \u2191 K,p| \u2193 K\u2032,\u2212p+| \u2193 K,p| \u2191 K\u2032,\u2212p\u2212 e2i\u03d5| \u2191 K,p| \u2191 K\u2032,\u2212p\u2212 e\u22122i\u03d5| \u2193 K,p| \u2193 K\u2032,\u2212p.\nIt is seen from the above expression that after averaging over the momentum direction the terms\ncorresponding to CM\nx,y \u221d (| \u2191 K,p| \u2191 K\u2032,\u2212p \u00b1 | \u2193 K,p| \u2193 K\u2032,\u2212p) disappear, since  e\u00b12i\u03d5 \u03d5 = 0,\nwhereas terms correponding to the sublattice symmetric Cooperons, CM\nz \u221d (| \u2191 K,p| \u2193 K\u2032,\u2212p +\n| \u2193 K,p| \u2191 K\u2032,\u2212p) remain non-zero.\nThe dephasing e\ufb00ect of trigonal warping in bilayer is similar to monolayer, although it is\ncaused by a di\ufb00erent mechanism, and its magnitude is estimated by Eq. (4). Dephasing due\nto warping suppresses the intravalley Cooperons Cx,y\nz leading to the absence of WL magne-\ntoresistance in the case of weak intervalley scattering, \u03c4i \u226b \u03c4\u03d5. Whereas in the case of strong\nintervalley scattering, \u03c4i \u226a \u03c4\u03d5, WL is partially restored. Thus one expects the WL behavior of\na bilayer graphene with strong trigonal warping of Fermi line in each valley to be described by\nEq. (1).\n3.3 Diagrammatic calculation of the weak localization correction in monolayer graphene\n3.3.1 Single particle Green\u2019s function and Drude conductivity\nWe derive the disorder averaged Green function for the bilayer Hamiltonian Eq.

Intervalley\nscattering also leads to the relaxation of C0\nz although it does not a\ufb00ect the valley-symmetric\nmode Cz\nz. Together, all the scattering mechanisms limit the transport time \u03c4\u22121 = \u03c4\n\u22121\n0 +\n \nsl \u03c4\n\u22121\nsl .\nDue to quadratic spectrum of quasiparticles in bilayer graphene the velocity operator, \u02c6 vx =\n\u2212(px\u03c3x + py\u03c3y)\/m, \u02c6 vy = (py\u03c3x \u2212 px\u03c3y)\/m, is momentum dependent, and thus the current\nvertices in the conductivity diagram Fig. 5(c) are not renormalized by impurity scattering\naccounted for by the diagram series Fig.5(b). As a result, the Drude conductivity is described\nby g = 4e2\u03bdD, where D = 1\n2v2\nF\u03c40 and \u03c4tr = \u03c40.Will be inserted by the editor 13\n3.3.2 Classi\ufb01cation of Cooperon modes\nWe parametrize the Cooperons utilizing the expression,\nC\nM1M2\nS1S2 =\n1\n4\n \n\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b1\u2032,\u03b2\u2032\n \n\u03be, ,\u03be\u2032, \u2032\n(\u03c3y\u03c3S1)\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03a0y\u03a0\u03ba1)\n\u03be  C\n\u03be ,\u03be\n\u2032 \n\u03b1\u03b2,\u03b1\u2032\u03b2\u2032 (\u03c3S2\u03c3y)\u03b2\u2032\u03b1\u2032 (\u03a0\u03ba2\u03a0y)\n \n\u2032\u03be\n\u2032\n.\nThe Bethe-Salpeter equation for Cooperons in bilayer reads,\nC\nM1M2\nS1S2 (q) = \u03c40 \u03b4M1,M2\u03b4S1,S2\n+\n1\n4\u03c0\u03b3\u03c40\u00af h\n \nS,M\nC\nMM2\nSS2 (q)\n \nd2p\n(2\u03c0)\n2Tr\n \n\u03a0M\u03c3S\u03a0y\u03c3y\n \nGR\np,\u00af h\u03c9+\u01eb\n t\n\u03a0y\u03c3y\u03a0M1\u03c3S1GA\n\u00af hq\u2212p,\u01eb\n \n.

(26) predicts a negative MR e\ufb00ect\nsaturated at B \u223c Bi (in contrast to conventional electron systems, where the logarithmic \ufb01eld\ndependence extends into the \ufb01eld range of B \u223c \u00af hc\/4De\u03c4tr).\n4 Conclusions and the e\ufb00ect of edges in a disordered nanoribbon\nWe have shown that p \u2192 \u2212p asymmetry of the electron dispersion in each valley of graphene\nleads to unusual (for conventional disordered conductors) behavior of interference e\ufb00ects in\nelectronic transport. Without intervalley scattering, trigonal warping of the electron disper-\nsion near the center of each valley destroys the manifestation of chirality in the localization\nproperties, resulting in a suppression of weak anti-localization in monolayer graphene and of\nweak localization in a bilayer. Intervalley scattering tends to restores weak localization, and\nthis behavior is universal for monolayer and bilayer graphene, despite the fact that electrons in\nthese two materials have di\ufb00erent chiralities and can be attributed di\ufb00erent Berry phases: \u03c0 in\nmonolayers, 2\u03c0 in bilayers [3,5]. This suggests that a suppressed weak localization magnetore-\nsistance and its sensitivity to intervalley scattering are speci\ufb01c to all ultrathin graphitic \ufb01lms\nindependently of their morphology [19] and are determined by the lower (trigonal) symmetry\ngroup of the wavevector K in the corner of the hexagonal Brillouin zone of a honeycomb lattice\ncrystal.\nFinally, in a narrow ribbon of graphene, monolayer or bilayer, with the transverse di\ufb00usion\ntime L2\n\u22a5\/D \u226a \u03c4i,\u03c4\u2217,\u03c4\u03d5, the sample edges determine strong intervalley scattering rate [33].\nThus, when solving Cooperon equations in a wire, we estimate \u0393l\n0 \u223c \u03c02D\/L2\n\u22a5 for the pseudospin\ntriplet, whereas the singlet C0\n0 remains gapless. This yields negative MR persistent over the\n\ufb01eld range B < 2\u03c0B\u22a5, where B\u22a5 \u2261 \u00af hc\/eL2\n\u22a5:\n \u03c1wire (B)\n\u03c12 =\n2e2L\u03d5\nh\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0 1\n \n1 + 1\n3B2\/B\u03d5B\u22a5\n\u2212 1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb. (27)\nThe results of Eqs. (18-27) give a complete description of the WL e\ufb00ect in graphene and\ndescribe how the WL magnetoresistance re\ufb02ects the degree of valley symmetry breaking in it.\nThis project has been funded by EPSRC grant EP\/C511743 and completed during the MPI\nPKS Seminar \u201dDynamics and Relaxation in Complex Quantum and Classical Systems and\nNanostructures.\u201d\nReferences\n1.
