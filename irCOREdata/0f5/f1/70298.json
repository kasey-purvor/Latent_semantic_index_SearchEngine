It demonstrates our idea for \na novel interface based on the metaphor of pinning and \nremoving papers from the surface of a notice board. It also \nreflects an interesting extension of the functionality of the \nphysical object when it is overlaid with digital capabilities. \nThe notice board allows notes and documents to be \nattached onto it by using pins. The pins are colored either \nred, orange or green - corresponding to three different \nlevels of priority one would assign to a document that was \nposted on a notice board. This allows a way for the user of \nthe notice board to inform the system when she would like \nto be reminded of the existence of the document, and the \nneed to pay attention to what it contains. As such, it allows \nthe user to attach a digital reminder to a physical \ndocument, in the same way that it is possible to set a \nreminder to do a certain task on a PDA or a calendar on \nthe PC.  \nIn this way the user can choose how much time they would \nlike to pass before they are reminded of the document by \nchoosing a pin designated with a high, medium or low \npriority color. When this time expires, a small light built \nonto the pin will begin to flash to display this fact. The \nuser must then unfasten the document from the board in \norder for the pin to stop flashing. Information about when \ndocuments were posted, their level of priority and how \nmuch time they have before their reminder expires is \ndisplayed on a screen nearby. This information can also be \naccessed via a web interface, and the system can deliver \nthe reminders via messages to the user\u2019s e-mail inbox. \n \nMOTIVATION \nNotice Boards as Information Displays \nNotice boards are generally made of cork or other soft \nmaterials that allow pins to be fastened onto them, \nallowing papers and other objects that allow it to be \nattached onto a vertical surface. These boards are often \nplaced in very visible places where people spend time or \nwalk by often. They vary is size and are used in a variety \nof locations, and the simple functionality they provide is \nput to a wide range of uses - from displaying family \nphotographs to posting information to others to see. \nA particular application of notice boards is to use them to \npost up documents that need be dealt with in some way. \nPinning a document on the board creates a reminder that \nattention needs to be paid to the particular piece \ninformation of paper by making it highly visible. For \nexample, an electricity bill that needs to be paid in the \nfollowing week, or a personal letter that should be \nanswered.  \nWe became interested in considering how people use \nnotice boards as a way to organize their way in how to deal \nwith paper-based documents. This motivated us to think \nabout how we could extend and increment the functionality \nof traditional notice boards to enable more powerful \napplications. \nPin&Play \nPin&Play is a system that allows individual objects to be \npowered and networked together by placing them on a \ncommon surface [1]. It allows physical nodes to be added \nand removed in an ad-hoc fashion. These nodes consist of \na variety of interaction components, such as lights, \nswitches, sliders and dials. Each node also contains some \nmemory, and the ability to retain this memory for several \nyears, even when disconnected from the networked \nsurface. \nThe surface provides an interface to a controller on which \napplications can be developed to create a logical overlay \nbetween the nodes. This is done via conductive fabrics \nembedded within insulating layers of the surface. The \ncontroller can be a local or remote networked PC, or a \nsmall embedded device. When running on a PC, the \ncontroller can also act as graphical user interface to the \nnetworked nodes - reacting to their state or controlling \ntheir behavior. It also provides remote access and control \nof the surface through a web interface. \nIn the current implementation of Pin&Play, nodes are \nattached onto the surface by the use of pins that allow them \nto pierce and fasten onto it. Different sections of the pins \nmake a physical connection with conductive layers \nembedded within the surface, which in turn provides a \nphysical network layer on which runs the industry-\nstandard 1-Wire protocol  [2]. The pins provide a bus on \nthe node onto which small devices can be connected, \nnetworked and powered, allowing the creation of very \nsmall interaction components (Figure 2).  \n \nFigure 1.  A Pin&Play node \n \nThe pin connectors add an interesting affordance to the \ninterface, as the majority of people are familiar with the \nconcept of pinning objects onto surfaces. We believe that \nthis will allow for the development of intuitive physical \ninterfaces that can be digitally augmented to allow for \ncomplex interactions.  \n \n \n \nDESCRIPTION OF DEMONSTRATION \nThe demonstration consists of an augmented notice board \nthat retains the appearance and functionality of a \ntraditional notice board that one might find hanging on a \nkitchen wall or office. The only clue as to its digital \naugmentation is the presence of a thin cable emerging \nfrom one corner, which connects it to a laptop nearby.  \nThere are also a set of objects in the form factor of tacks, \nor pushpins. They are made to closely resemble the types \nof pins one would use to post documents on a notice board. \nThey have a flat head with a 1.5cm diameter and a pin \nprotruding from the middle. On the opposite side, the pin \ncontains a small blue LED lamp (Figure 2).  \n \n \nFigure 2.  The Pin&Play notice board pins \n \nThe pins are divided into three differently colored groups: \nred, orange and green. Pins from each group represent a \nreminder to deal with a document in a high, medium or \nlow priority manner. If a red\/high priority pin is used to \nfasten a document, a reminder is set for a day\u2019s time. An \norange\/medium priority pin has a time of one week, and a \ngreen\/low priority a time of one month. The associated \ntime to any of the categories of pins can be configured, and \nit is also possible to introduce other categories with new \nassociated meanings.  \nA graphical interface presented on the screen of the laptop \nshows an abstracted representation of the current \ndocuments posted on the board (Figure 3). They are \nstamped with the time and date when they were originally \nposted, when the reminder is set to trigger the alarm, and a \ncountdown of how much time is remaining on the \nreminder. This interface can also be accessed remotely by \nvisiting a website. \n \n Figure 3.  Digital representation \n \nWhen the time for the digital reminder is reached, a \ndocument is flagged as expired. This fact is displayed on \nthe physical notice board by turning on a small but bright \nblue LED on the pin of the appropriate document.  \nThe light on the pin is highly visible, and clearly stands \nout of other objects on the notice board. In this way, a \nsuggestion is made to the user to pay attention to the \nattached document in a non-obtrusive and highly relevant \nway.  To reset the alarm, the pin must be unfastened. The \ndocument may be attached again with the same or a \ndifferent category pin, similar to pressing Snooze on an \nalarm clock.. Hopefully though, the document will be dealt \nwith or at least taken off the notice to make room for new \nposts. \n \nREFERENCES \n1. K. Van Laerhoven, N. Villar, A. Schmidt, H.-W. \nGellersen, M.
