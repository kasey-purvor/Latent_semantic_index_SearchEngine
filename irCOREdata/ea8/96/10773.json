However, \nthe role of the state in the governance of the vital system for Internet naming \nand addressing has been comparatively under-addressed by political \nscience. The commercialization  of the Internet has seen a substantive \ngrowth in country code domain name registrations (e.g. dot uk, dot \nde)   raising significant questions about appropriate governance forms and \nregulatory functions to allow for both an efficient domain name market and \na robust public policy framework to cater for consumer and citizen interests. \nThis paper draws on conceptualisations of 'new governance' in emerging \nglobal economic sectors to characterise emerging patterns in country code \ntop level domain name (ccTLD) governance in Europe. It finds that states \nhave chosen to devolve the governance of ccTLDs to independent privately \nordered parties, in the process creating non-hierarchical systems of \ngovernance characteristic of those found in the \u2018new governance\u2019 literature. \nNevertheless, the state is still an important actor in these systems, whose \nprecise position varies according to the national case in question. \n  \n \n  2Introduction  \nElectronic communications - traditionally composed of telecommunications and mass \ncommunications media - is, in several ways, the epitome of a fast-moving, dynamic \nsector of the 21\nst century international economy. The Internet, arguably the blazon of \ninnovation in communications technologies, services and markets over the last 15 or so \nyears, was originally viewed by many as a new potentially global communications \nfrontier with radical transformative potential. Most situations of dynamic movement in \ntechnologies and markets tend to call forth debates on regulatory governance, often \nresulting in innovative change. Electronic communications is historically a sector in \nwhich governance \u2013 and regulatory change in particular - have been particularly \nimportant issues. Recent technological developments in electronic communications with \nconvergence characteristics, such as the Internet, have further complicated matters, \nraising issues of \u2018cross-boundary\u2019 regulatory governance. \nHistorically, the state in Europe has exercised a strong interventionist role in the \nelectronic communications sector, something which the development of the Internet \nappeared as a radical challenge to, in the first instance at least. Though state-funded in its \nformative years, the Internet \u2018grew up\u2019 outside the confines of mainstream electronic \ncommunications in the USA. It developed a libertarian, even \u2018counter-cultural\u2019, \ncommunications philosophy in the days when utilised primarily by academics and \ncomputer enthusiasts. Its subsequent commercialisation, though challenging this original \nmodel, nevertheless too was radical and liberal in terms of the orthodoxy of free market \ncapitalism it espoused. All this development suggested strongly that the Internet, though \nresembling other parts of the electronic communications sector, was developing in a \nradically different way from them, not least in terms of governance (or the lack of it) and \nthe (potential) role of the state. John Perry Barlow, addressing the state even went as far \nas to assert, \u2018I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent \nof the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you \npossess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to \nfear\u2019(http:\/\/homes.eff.org\/~barlow\/Declaration-Final.html).  \nThis paper focuses on the development in Europe of one, to date under-addressed, \naspect of the complex governance constellation developing around the Internet: its \nsystem of naming and addressing. At the international level, the Internet Corporation for \nAssigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was formed in 1999 assuming governance \nresponsibility for the critical technical and organisational resources required to facilitate \nthis. As is explained in more detail below, two types of nomenclature evolved for Internet \naddressing: generic (for example dot com, dot net and dot org) and country code (for \nexample dot de, dot uk and dot fr). The system was hierarchically ordered, with Top \nLevel Domains (either generic or country code) at the root of a typical user\u2019s Internet \naddress and without which access to the Internet would be impossible (Mueller 2002). \nThe organisation of Internet addressing through the country code system represented one \nobvious potential point of entry and influence for the state in Internet policy matters. Its \ncommercialisation through the1990s led to growing demand for ccTLDs by potential \nInternet users and governments which were not at the forefront of its early development. \nFor governments, the ability to utilise ccTLDs as a means of creating a national identity \nin cyberspace and of ordering the nature of Internet communication undertaken by users, \nwas obvious and proved attractive. To what extent, and precisely how, in Europe, would \n  3the state try to bring itself back in (see Drezner 2004, 2007) to this aspect of Internet \ngovernance? \nTo tackle this question, this paper draws on recent findings from the literature on \ngovernance to characterize the development of ccTLD regulation in Europe. Recent \npolitical science work has paid considerable attention to the nature, and potential \nefficacy, of new kinds of regulatory governance, the outstanding feature of which is a \nmodification to the traditional role of the state as evidenced in its hierarchical, directly \ninterventionist form, characteristic of the corporatist era. Of particular interest in the last \nfew years has been work which explores non-hierarchical regulatory governance which \ngoes beyond the kind identified with the \u2018regulatory\u2019 state in Europe, itself a well-\nestablished replacement for the declining corporate state in an era of neo-liberalism. We \nposit in this paper that regulatory governance in the ccTLD sector and the role of the state \nin recent developments within this aspect of Internet governance, can be explained and \nunderstood within a spectrum inclusive of hierarchical governance at one end and non-\nhierarchical governance on the other. In the process, insights into the character and \nfunctioning of \u2018governance\u2019 might also be yielded from an exploration of the case of the \nInternet and the ccTLD sector specifically.  \nAlthough the research presented here is at an early stage, evidence suggests that non-\nhierarchical elements are recognizable in the governance of Europe\u2019s ccTLDs, although \nthey do not take a standard \u2018government in absentia\u2019 form. They also vary on a case-by-\ncase basis, despite a potentially strong policy convergence \u2018pull\u2019 from the global Internet \ngovernance level through ICANN. Thus, in a mixed picture, it is clear that, contrary to \nthe predictions of advocates of (new) non-hierarchical governance, the state, or at least \nthe public sector - is often a key player. The reasons for this paradoxical finding are \nexplored in the paper, which proceeds structurally as follows. The next section of the \npaper charts the development of ccTLDs as resources of communication deemed to \nrequire a system of governance, and provides an understanding of the role of the state in \nthe global and national aspects of ccTLD governance. Following this, the extent to which \nthe Internet and its ccTLDs might be a suitable case to apply work on governance to yield \nexplanatory utility is considered and an outline of the central aspects of and differences \nbetween hierarchical and non-hierarchical governance is provided. The penultimate \nsection of the paper provides a brief overview of the features of ccTLD governance in \nEurope, paying particular attention to four cases which, taken together, provide examples \nof both similarity and variety to be found in current systems at the national level. They \nalso illustrate the nature and extent of state involvement in this aspect of Internet \ngovernance. The final section of the paper explores the implications of the findings of the \nprevious section and the case of ccTLDs for the study of new governance.  \n \nUnderstanding ccTLD Governance  \nThe development of the Internet and, in particular, its commercialisation in the mid-\n1990s, greatly increased its economic and political significance, not least that of domain \nnames, the key strategic identifiers for users of the World Wide Web. The Domain Name \nSystem (DNS) was originally conceived in governance terms, within a \u2018post-\ngovernmental\u2019 architecture, reflective of the liberal, decentralised vision of the technical \nand academic communities which constructed it. Nonetheless, in technical terms, the \nsystem is hierarchically ordered, the main purpose of which was to act as a mechanism \n  4for matching numerical Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that identified individual host \ncomputers on the Internet, with user-friendly domain names. At the core of the DNS at \nthe top of the hierarchy is the authoritative \u2018root\u2019 computer server, holding the data which \nall other root servers copy in order to enable identification of information in the Top \nLevel Domain, and subsequent levels below this (Second Level Domain, Third Level \nDomain etc).  \nThe increased importance of domain names in the global electronic economy, \nparalleled with an expansion in the number of economic and political stakeholders, led in \n1999 to the global institutionalisation of their management and administration within the \nprivate, not-for-profit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). \nPrior to this, allocation of Internet addresses was done on an ad hoc basis through the \nInternet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In ICANN are recognisable several \nelements of \u2018new governance\u2019: it was set up as a self-regulatory body with only an \nadvisory function for governments exercisable through the Governmental Advisory \nCommittee (GAC). Given the history of Internet address management, private interest \ngovernance was considered preferable to government control by those interests which \nheld determining influence in negotiations leading to ICANN\u2019s creation (see Mueller \n2002). This approach  did not sit well with many states and international governmental \nactors, exacerbated by the fact that ICANN operated under contract with the US \nDepartment of Commerce, giving the US government a direct oversight role, and thereby \neffective control, over the regulation of Internet identifiers (Christou and Simpson 2006, \n2007). \nThere are two main identifiable forms of TLDs in cyberspace: generic (gTLDs), of \nwhich there are now 19 and country code (ccTLDs), of which there are 245. The number \nof registrations for ccTLDs has tripled from 12 million in 2000 to 33 million in 2005 \n(OECD 2006: 10). TLDs are strategic: they provide identity and a platform for socio-\neconomic development. This, plus the corollary that abuses of the system has led to \nincreased concerns over user and system security has, led governments to take a much \ngreater interest in gaining a stake in their governance. ICANN\u2019s legitimacy and authority \nhas been challenged by nation states both internally - with regard to the remit of its GAC \nand the US government\u2019s oversight role - and in the external policy environment, through \nthe process leading to the UN organised World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) \n(2003-2005) (Christou and Simpson 2007, forthcoming). Control over ccTLDs has also \nbeen a sight of contestation where territorial interest, national symbolism and access to \nthe global electronic economy have been key issues. Matters have been further \ncomplicated in that ccTLD management, unlike the case of gTLDs, involved a significant \nrole for national bodies (albeit ad hoc in nature) in early adopter Internet states outside \nthe US. \nAlthough the presence of the state in TLD governance was deeply contested by those \nwithin the Internet community correlating such intervention with inefficiency, censorship \nand control, over the last five years or so there has been a gradual recognition, and for \nsome acquiescence, that: \u2018policy authority for Internet related public policy issues is the \nsovereign right of States\u2019 (WSIS Declaration, Dec 2003). The fact that global Internet \npolicy decisions have direct impact on national domains by virtue of the Internet\u2019s \ntechnical and managerial architecture means that the precise nature and extent of state \npolicy-making authority is still contested. Deliberations through the WSIS (2005) \n  5sponsored Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG) aimed at reaching a \nresolution resulted in the creation of  the UN based Internet Governance Forum (IGF), a \nmulti-stakeholder discussion-only platform for governments and other stakeholders that \nwould not have any oversight functions nor any role in the \u2018day-to-day or technical \noperations of the Internet\u2019 (WGIG 2005: 12). The IGF, though not the subject of this \npaper, does in some of its core elements mark an attempt to create a global level \ngovernance structure whose features are recognisable in the new regulatory governance \nliterature. \nThe relationship between ccTLD administrations, national governments and ICANN \nhas also, at times, been fractious. The initial informal \u2018post-governmental\u2019 model for \nccTLD administration and delegation developed by the US Internet pioneer, Jon Postel, \nin the mid 1980s - underpinned by the RFC 1591 document\n1 and delivered through IANA \n- had become unsustainable once governments awoke to the strategic importance of the \nInternet (although a self-regulatory approach remained). ICANN\u2019s attempt to formalise \nits relationship with governments through its Corporate Policy (ICANN 1999) and GAC \nprinciples (ICANN 2000), the latter recognising the sovereignty of national governments \nover their domain names, led initially only to protracted disagreement between ICANN \nand certain ccTLD managers and governments over its authority and legitimacy in terms \nof the IANA function and the delegation\/re-delegation of domain names (Christou and \nSimpson 2007, forthcoming).  \nIn order to remedy this situation the country code Name Supporting Organization \n(ccNSO) was established in 2002 to provide a voice to ccTLD administrations within the \nICANN process, and to enable ICANN to: provide better support to ccTLD managers in \ndelivering its IANA (that is, delegation\/re-delegation) function; develop proposals for \nbest practice for ccTLDs; coordinate with other ICANN committees and bodies on \nccTLD issues. New structures were also agreed providing more flexibility and choice for \nccTLD administrations in terms of the engagement frame and relationship they wished to \npursue with ICANN. For those that sought to establish a formal relationship, an \n\u2018Accountability Framework\u2019 was elaborated setting out clearly the responsibilities of both \nICANN and ccTLDs. Alternatively, a system of \u2018letter exchange\u2019 was designed for \nccTLDs that desired a more informal arrangement with ICANN, whereby there was \nagreement on broad guidelines for the respective responsibilities of each party \n(http:\/\/ccnso.icann.org\/workinggroups\/accountframeworkwg.htm)  \nIn addition, voluntary guidelines setting out a rationale for ccTLD fee contributions to \nthe ICANN budget (a source of great contestation for many ccTLD administrations) was \nestablished in order to provide an equitable distribution of cost across the ccTLD \ncommunity based on size and revenue (http:\/\/ccnso.icann.org\/about\/files\/guideline-cctld-\ncontribution.pdf)\n2. The relationship between the national and global level, however, \ndespite these changes, has merely improved at the margins, and can still only best be \ndescribed as in flux, reflective of the Internet governance regime more broadly. More \nspecifically, whilst some ccTLD administrations advocate a stronger role and voice for \nthemselves within ICANN and cooperate actively with the ccNSO to develop policy, the \nmajority of ccTLDs are still not ccNSO members (only 55 out of the 264 that exist, and \nonly 8 of the 55 are from Europe) and have not signed a formal contract with ICANN\n3. \nThe reasons for this are twofold. First, there is dispute over precisely which ccTLD \npolicy matters should be addressed globally rather than locally. Second, there is an \n  6ongoing questioning of the legitimacy of ICANN to govern the DNS (OECD 2006: 37). \nHere, ccTLDs within Europe have developed a collective regional voice within and \noutside ICANN through the privately constituted Council of European National Top-\nLevel Domain Name Registries (CENTR). CENTR has also been proactive in \ncoordinating ccTLD policy, developing best practice, and undertaking projects on \nimportant organisational and policy issues impacting on ccTLDs in Europe (see \nhttp:\/\/www.centr.org\/), and provides an example of a European transnational body \ninvolved in \u2018new\u2019 governance activities in the ccTLD sector. \nWhat then of the role of national governments in ccTLD governance at the national \n\/local level? It is clear that to create a commercially efficient and public policy protective \nTLD at the national level requires some degree of consensus and convergence on guiding \nprinciples and practical rules for ccTLD governance between the global, regional and \nnational levels, and between public and private actors within the policy process. \nHowever, whilst for the non-territorial gTLDs clear rules were provided and implemented \nglobally by ICANN at the outset for their governance, this has not been the case with \nccTLDs. The revised GAC Principles and Guidelines for the Delegation and \nAdministration of ccTLDs recognised explicitly the principle of \u2018subsidiarity\u2019 in the \nrelationship between ICANN, ccTLD administrations and governments, whereby ccTLD \npolicy should be set locally unless the matter in question had indisputable impacts \nbeyond the national level (ICANN 2005). In addition, the GAC principles (ICANN 2005) \ncall for the public interest to be secured in existing national public policy frameworks \nthough the procedural detail specifying the attainment of this is left open (OECD 2006). \nAs a consequence, the ccTLD system which has developed at the national level bears the \nhallmarks of Internet governance as it has evolved over approximately the last two \ndecades at the global level as well as approaches developed by states to governance of \ncritical (in this case communications) resources with international political economic \ncharacteristics. To what extent can work on new regulatory governance assist in \ncharacterising and explaining the development of ccTLD regulatory governance \nnationally in Europe? \n \nModes of Governance and the State  \nA critical question for this paper is precisely how, in Europe, the state is bringing itself \nback in to the ccTLD aspect of Internet governance across our sample case studies. \nWhilst this has been addressed at length in relation to the developing international \nregulatory regime for the Internet (see Drezner 2004, 2007; Christou and Simpson 2007 \nin relation to the EU), ccTLD governance remains relatively under-theorised. The nature \nof state involvement in Internet governance can be understood in the context of changing \nstate functions (or modes) of governance in a globalising world on, the one hand, and the \npeculiarities that underpinned the commercialisation of the Internet on the other. We have \nargued elsewhere (Christou and Simpson 2006, 2007) that core aspects of Internet \ngovernance developed at the EU level, notably for its own \u2018ccTLD\u2019, dot eu, can be \ncharacterised by a cross-fertilisation of the, by now, well documented rise of the \nregulatory state  - where governance is based on process and an increased role for non-\nstate actors within a legal backdrop (business, civil society, courts, industry) and the role \nof the state becomes that of \u2018steering\u2019 (guiding and steering the economy) rather than \n\u2018rowing\u2019 (direct intervention) -  and the governance traditions that characterised the \n  7historical evolution of the Internet, including decentralisation and self-regulation. The dot \neu top level domain name is a classic example of double-agencification and state \nshadowed or \u2018regulated\u2019 self-regulation.  \nAs yet, there is no precise agreement on the meaning of the term governance in the \nliterature. Broadly defined, it may incorporate the \u2018empirical manifestation of state \nadaptation to its external environment\u2019 and \u2018the conceptual or theoretical representation \nof the coordination of social systems\u2019 (Pierre 2000: 3). This accommodates a situation \nwhere non-hierarchical forms of governance are prevalent as well the interaction of \npublic and private actors within a governance network. It also accommodates questions \nabout the nature and capacity of the state (and related public institutions) to steer, and in \nturn, the relationship of non-state (private and semi-private) actors and interests to the \nstate. Here both formal and informal aspects of the interaction between public and private \nactors, \u2018which are manifested in different types of networks and public-private \npartnerships\u2019 (Kohler-Koch and Rittberger 2006, 29) are of concern. Overall, such a \nbroad definition allows the complexity of the ccTLD \u2018regulatory regime\u2019 (Eberlein and \nGrande 2005) to be captured: the variety of relevant actors, public and private working \nwithin formal and informal processes and institutions.  \nIn this context, a distinction is often made in the governance literature between the \nhierarchical mode \u2013 characterised by direct or delegated intervention and formal \nregulation through law (identifiable within the corporate and regulatory state) \u2013 and the \n\u2018new\u2019 non-hierarchical or plurilateral mode (Zielonka 2007; Cerny, 1993) characterised \nby informal arrangements, and the use of \u2018non-legal\u2019 tools such as codes of conduct, \n\u2018soft\u2019 law and contracts developed outside primary and secondary legislation (identifiable \nin the post-regulatory state literature \u2013 see Scot (2004)). Whilst hierarchical governance \nis about compliance with clear lines of control and responsibility emanating from central \nauthorities or their agents, non-hierarchical governance incorporates networks, involving \nboth public and private actors (Hooghe and Marks 2001, Eising and Kohler-Koch 1999), \nand multidimensional governance. It is also more about the pursuit of negotiation and \npersuasion, with incentives, rather than compliance with the threat of sanctions, to \nachieve regulatory outcomes. There is a movement away from the pyramidal (top-down) \nstructure of governance, to more of a \u2018junction box\u2019 (Richardson 2001), with emphasis on \n\u2018gardening\u2019 rather than steering \u2018reflecting principles of flexibility, subsidiarity, \ndevolution and differentiation\u2019 (Zielonka 2007: 192). Such non-hierarchical governance \nchimes with the idea of a \u2018post-regulatory state\u2019 which emphasises  alternative tools \noutside state law for influencing regulatory behaviour, and the role of community, \npractice and socialisation to incentivise actors to comply.  New modes of governance \nwithin the EU space, such as the Open Method of Coordination (OMC), are also \nreflective of the key features of post-regulatory state methods outside formal EU law, \nincluding benchmarking, peer-review, and standard setting, and tend to rely on \nvoluntarism to achieve compliance (Eberlein and Kerwer 2004; Lodge 2007). \nNon-hierarchical governance, argue its advocates, provides greater flexibility and \nefficiency. It provides a context for \u2018thick\u2019 learning, allowing states to cope much better \nwith the pressures emanating from globalisation and regionalisation. However, it is by no \nmeans uncontested, most notably by states with strong dirigiste traditions. Its efficacy is \nalso open to question in terms of legitimacy and accountability. Whereas traditional or \nhierarchical governance enjoys legitimacy through its underpinning in a system of \n  8majority rule and a common national purpose (Zielonka 2007: 191), this is not true of \nnon-hierarchical modes which operate outside the legal and political framework. \nAdditionally, whilst hierarchical governance enjoys a relative degree of transparency and \naccountability through elections, private, self-regulated, networks within non-hierarchical \ngovernance modes are neither democratically elected nor accountable. Furthermore, non-\nhierarchical modes of governance raise questions of effectiveness and compliance.  \nThe strict dichotomy between a hierarchical top-down public model, and a private \nnon-hierarchical networked model, whilst heuristically useful, tends to belie reality. \nWhilst new non-hierarchical governance modes to meet public policy goals in a \nglobalised era (Howlett and Rayner 2006:170) inevitably point to reduction in state \ncapacity (and law to ensure compliance) through reliance on private actors, it has also \nbeen recognised that the distinction between the public and the private sphere is by no \nmeans clear (Black 2002:3; Ronit 2005). Often public and private spheres interact \n(Zielonka 2007): private governance not only needs recognition by the state but often \u2018the \nstate remains a central feature in understanding the governance functions undertaken by \nprivate actors in both domestic and international affairs\u2019 (Graz and N\u00f6lke 2007, 20, \nforthcoming). Furthermore, Stone-Sweet (2006: 627) argues that private governance \nsystems are \u2018parasitic on state authority\u2019. Given the aim of this paper to characterise and \nexplain the role of the state in ccTLD governance, it is thus important to provide further \nanalytical benchmarks for analysing the public:private relationship (see Table 1). \n \nTable 1 \u2013 The relationship between public and private \nHierarchical                        Non-hierarchical \nCorporatist  State    Regulatory  State    Post Regulatory State \n\u2018Concerted action\u2019  \u2018Subcontracting\u2019 \u2018Market-based \nregulation\u2019\/Coerced \nSelf-regulation \n\u2018Voluntary Action\u2019 \n  \nWhere the state sets \nboth formal and \nsubstantive \nconditions for rule-\nmaking  \nWhere state \ninvolvement is limited \nto setting formal \nconditions for rule-\nmaking with private \nactors then shaping the \ncontent. \nInvolves industry-\nsetting, monitoring \nand enforcing \nstandards in the \nknowledge that if it \nfails, state \nintervention could be \nimminent, that is, \nself-regulation in the \nshadow of the state \nSelf-regulation can occur in \na purely voluntary way with \nno direct state stimulus or \nintervention. \n \nSource: Derived from \u2018Self-regulation of Digital Media\u2019 (2004, p.11) and Verhulst and Price (2005)    \n \nThe two diametrically opposite types here are those of \u2018voluntary action\u2019, which \noccurs very rarely, and is germane to the idea of non-hierarchical governance, and that of \n\u2018concerted action\u2019, corresponding to a hierarchical mode of governance, whereby the \nstate sets the legal and regulatory backdrop for rule-making and enforcement. Such \ntypologies are not rigid, and the exact nature of the relationship between public and \nprivate actors can only be determined in the process of empirical investigation, which \nconstantly reveals new often hybrid forms. The types identified, however, serve as \n  9analytical benchmarks and are a useful starting point for conceptualising the regulatory \ngovernance regime in the ccTLD sector at the national level in Europe. Furthermore, they \nprovide an indication of how much distance there is between the two extremes of the \nspectrum, the key features of what is likely to exist in-between, and directions in which \ndevelopment of regulatory governance modes can occur.          \nOne of the most dominant discourses on globalisation\n4 emphasizes the decreasing \nrole of states, and a commensurately enriched role for non-state actors in governance. In \nthe Internet sector, the more radical elements of the Internet community predicted that \n\u2018Government sovereignty, already eroded by forces such as trade liberalisation, will \ndiminish further\u2026no longer will governments be able to set\u2026the standards they \nwant\u2019(cited in Drezner 2007: 93). To what extent has this been the case in ccTLD \ngovernance in Europe? To what extent can the literature on new regulatory governance \nexplain the pattern of ccTLD governance which has emerged at the national level and \nwhat are the implications of this? The remainder of the paper moves to address these two \nquestions.  \n \nPatterns of ccTLD Governance in Europe \nAs might be expected, based on existing research on the governance of global(ising) \nindustrial\/commercial phenomena at the national level in Europe (see Borzel 1993), the \norganization and governance of ccTLDs across Europe exhibit commonalities and \ndistinct differences. In a field very much under-addressed by political scientists, two \nrecent studies of ccTLDs worldwide by Geist (2003; 2004) and the OECD (2006) provide \nan opportunity to develop a picture of the broad characteristics of ccTLD governance. \nFigure 1 outlines the basic structural characteristics of ccTLD governance in a typical \nEuropean national case. In terms of establishing the nature of ccTLD governance in \nEurope along our \u2018hierarchical\u2019 or \u2018non-hierarchical\u2019 spectrum, the two core criteria are, \nfirst, the nature and role of the ccTLD registry organization and, second, the relationship \nbetween the state and the registry. As the OECD (2006: 19) has shown, in Europe, for the \nmost part, registries have been established as private commercially oriented entities, \nthough operational on a not-for-profit basis (that is, cost recovery with some provision for \nfinancial contingency). The registry plays the pivotal role in the functioning and \nmanagement of ccTLDs and is the central node in the ccTLD governance network (see \nFigure 1). It is the guardian of information, through stewardship of the \u2018Whois\u2019 database, \non users who have registered names under a typical ccTLD and makes decisions on how \nmuch, and what kind, of information on users is made publicly available. It is responsible \nfor regulating the behaviour of the ccTLD registrar industry \u2013 those companies which \ncompete, often aggressively, to register a name for a user under the ccTLD. The registry \nhas been responsible for setting the price for registrations per name and, in many cases, \nestablishing a code of conduct for registrar companies to comply with. The registry is \nalso responsible for hearing complaints from commercial players and customers involved \nin the ccTLD business. This has involved matters such as receiving submissions about \ncommercial mal-practice and infringement of claimed legitimate rights to a name, \nprincipally trademark but also public sector. The registry, in \n  10Figure 1: Core Features of ccTLD Governance in Europe \n \n \n \n           \nState                Global and Regional Context \n   \nInput  to  global  organisations         WSIS \nL e g i s l a t i o n          I C A N N     \n         W I P O    \n                       CENTR \n \n \n \nAdvisory Body \n                                                                   \n    \n Trademark  policy \n                   Fair  competition  among  registrars \n  ccTLD Registry  Policy on Whois database \n ccTLD policy development \n International relationship \n \n \n \n \n \n          ADR body        Registrar companies \n \n               \n \n \nCustomers\/users  \n \n \n \n \n \n  11many cases is responsible for overseeing the system which been set up to adjudicate on \ndisputes between parties regarding domain names. Here, Alternative Dispute Resolution \n(ADR) services are offered where (often online) hearings are held to resolve conflicts \nwithout recourse to the formal legal system. Occasionally, registries have aimed to settle \ndisputes on a more informal basis prior to ADR being operationalised.  \n \nTable 2 - Main Features of European ccTLDs.  \n \nCOUNTRY REGISTRY  TYPE  RELATIONSHIP \nWITH \nGOVERNMENT \nINPUT OF \nGOVERNMENT \nAustria auDA  Not-for-profit \ncorporation \nInformal   Observer  \nBelgium Nic.at  Not-for-profit \ncorporation \nInformal   None  \nCzech Republic  CZ.NIC Not-for-profit \ncorporation \nFormal   Management  \nDenmark DK  Hostmaster  Not-for-profit \ncorporation \nFormal   Legislation  \nFinland   Ficora  Part of \ngovernment \nFormal   Legislation  \nFrance AFNIC  Not-for-profit \ncorporation \nFormalizing   Council \nrepresentatives  \nGermany DENIC  eG Not-for-profit \ncooperative \nInformal   Observer  \nGreece FORTH-ICS  Foundation    Formal   Legislation \u2013 \ncontract with \nnational regulatory \nauthority \nHungary Domain.hu  Unspecified   Formal   Legislation  \nIreland IEDR  Not-for-profit \ncorporation \nNone   Legislation  \nItaly NIC.IT  Not-for-profit \ncorporation \nFormal   Management  \nLuxembourg RESTENA \nFoundation \nAcademia   Unspecified   Unspecified  \nNetherlands SIDN  Not-for-profit \ncorporation \nJoint project  Cabinet review \nNorway Norid  Not-for-profit \ncorporation \nFormal   Legislation  \nPoland   NASK  Not-for-profit \ncorporation \nFormal   Endorsement \nPortugal FCCN  Not-for-profit \ncorporation \nUnspecified   Unspecified  \nSpain ES-NIC  Part  of \ngovernment \nFormal   Legislation  \nSweden IIS  Not-for-profit \ncorporation \nInformal   Legislation  \nSwitzerland SWITCH  Academia Formal  Legislation \nUK Nominet  UK  Not-for-profit \ncorporation \nInformal Advisory \nSource: Adapted from OECD (2006: 19) \n \n  12 \nThe aim in these instances is to achieve a swifter, cheaper, resolution of disputes, and is a \nclear example of private interest-delivered, sectoral self-regulation.  \nWhat of the role of the state in the governance of ccTLDs in Europe? A cursory \nexamination of the position might suggest that a search for evidence of new non-\nhierarchical modes of regulatory governance here yields little. Work by the OECD (2006) \nargues that in Europe the state has a formal relationship with its ccTLD registry as often \nas it has an informal one. As shown in Table 2 above, formal relationships vary and can \ncomprise: direct input to the management of the ccTLD registry found in the Czech \nRepublic and Italy; the creation of directly applicable legislation as in the cases of \nSwitzerland, Spain, Norway, Hungary, Greece, Finland and Denmark; and what is \ndescribed as \u2018endorsement\u2019 in the Polish case. Informal relations range from nothing \nwhatsoever as in the Belgian and Irish cases; observer status as in the cases of Austria \nand Germany; working in an advisory capacity as in the case of the UK; and through \nlegislative input in the case of Sweden. The French case is described as a \u2018formalising\u2019 \nrelationship where the government supplies Ministry representatives to the registry\u2019s \nmanagement board. The Dutch example is described as a \u2018joint project\u2019 in which the \ngoverning cabinet undertakes a periodic review of the running of the ccTLD.  \nThis overview suggests a relatively strong presence of the state in the governance of \nits national ccTLD. The cases of Switzerland, Norway, France and the UK provide useful \nexamples of the range of public sector involvement in the governance of the sector and its \nrelationship to actors with private governance responsibility and are examined in more \ndetail below.   \nIn Switzerland, the Swiss Education and Research Network (SWITCH) as the registry \nfor dot ch (Switzerland) and dot li (Lichtenstein), plays the pivotal role in ccTLD \ngovernance. An interesting \u2018hybrid\u2019, it was established in 1987 by the state and the \nuniversity sector as a foundation of the private sector, and may be best be categorized as \na form of \u2018subcontracting\u2019. In 1996, the Swiss introduced the idea of \u2018holdership\u2019, that is \na right of use of domain names where these are not sold to customers but instead a fee is \ncharged for services around their usage (Schneider 2005). In 2003, a set of regulations for \ndot ch were laid out in law in the Federal Constitution through the Telecommunications \nAct. An administrative contract between the Swiss telecommunications national \nregulatory authority OFCOM, which plays a public oversight role, and SWITCH was \nestablished. The Swiss system has been viewed as a public-private partnership with \nshared responsibilities between the state and the ccTLD registry where, together, the \npublic policy and operational aspects of dot ch are delivered. The latter are conducted \naccording to a \u2018business-like\u2019 modus operandi. Unlike in most European cases SWITCH \nundertakes registration functions from domain name applicants which apply directly to it \n(OFCOM and SWITCH 2003). A system of ADR exists whose first phase, mediation, is \nmandatory (Schneider 2005) and is carried out by the WIPO Arbitration and Mediation \nCenter which provides a list of experts for approval by OFCOM. As of 2005, merely six \ncases had been dealt with, five of which resulted in the transfer of holdership rights. The \nunderpinning goals of the Swiss system are to ensure credibility for the registry, \ntransparency in the system of registration; to create shared responsibilities between the \nregistry (functional and operational mostly) and government (representational in \ninternational fora mostly) (Schneider 2005). \n  13The Norwegian registry for dot no, Norid, claims that it is a \u2018neutral actor\u2019, \u2018anchored \nin a strong social responsibility\u2019 (Norid 2007), and provides another example of a form of \n\u2018subcontracting\u2019 by the state. The registry\u2019s main tasks concern processing applications \nfor registration under dot no, which it receives from companies in the competitively \nordered domain name registration business, begun in 1999, with now more than 400 \nfirms in it. A detailed set of operational guidelines has been produced for registrars which \nmust enter into an agreement with Norid. It also has the broader role of developing \nNorwegian domain name policy. Norid is regulated by the Domain Regulation and, like \nthe Swiss case, is under the aegis of the national telecommunications regulatory \nauthority. Norid is part of UNINETT AS, the National Academic Research Network, \nwhich was delegated responsibility for dot no in 1987. This is a parent company \ncontaining four subsidiaries which supply universities and research institutions ICT \nservices, as well as undertaking what are described as \u2018national ICT tasks\u2019 under which \nthe dot no registry function falls. UNINETT is owned by the Norwegian Ministry of \nEducation and Research. Like the Swiss case, Norid, created in 1996, operates as a not-\nfor-profit company. The system contains an ADR function in which Norid acts as a \nsecretariat in collating necessary statements from parties to a dispute. There is an \nindependent ADR body which adjudicates disputes, having handled 82 cases (Norid \n2007) at the time of writing.  The Norwegian system has undergone considerable \nliberalization and movement towards a market model, albeit delivered by a public sector \ncompany. From 2001, it became possible to register multiple names under dot no and \nfrom 2003 Norid\u2019s status changed into a separate limited-liability company (Norid \n2007b). \nCreated in 1987 also, the French ccTLD registry, AFNIC, was, until 1998, under the \ncontrol of the French National Institute for Information Technology and Automation \nresearch (INRIA). It now, however, operates as a not-for-profit association without \nshareholders (Gorichon 2005). AFNIC\u2019s management structure is a reflection of the \ndilemma of a traditionally mercantilist state such as France in the governance of a \ncommunications asset with social and now to a very considerable extent, commercial, \nimperatives. On the one hand, the presence of the state is very much in evidence in the \nmanagement structure of the registry, the aim being to secure \u2018co-development\u2019. Here, as \nmuch as half the board of management of AFNIC come from the public sector, or \n\u2018founder members\u2019, as they are described: two representatives from INRIA and three \nfrom French government through, respectively, the Ministries for Telecommunications, \nIndustry, and Research. Article 22 of AFNIC\u2019s Articles of Association states that it, \u2018may \nbe dissolved at the request of the founder members of the association in order to entrust \nthe continuation of the Association\u2019s activity to a general interest legal entity with a \nsimilar purpose\u2019. In France, \u2018the ccTLD is held to be a public or collective resource that \ncannot come under the heading of private property and must be managed in the general \ninterest\u2026governments in the final instance have authority over the ccTLDs pertaining to \ntheir territory\u2019 (French government 2003: 2). \nOn the other hand and by contrast, there has been a very significant move in the \ndirection of liberalization in the ccTLD market in France in recent years. Once one of the \nmost restrictive ccTLDs in Europe, in May 2004 it was made bureaucratically less \nburdensome (more flexible) for companies to register under dot fr, which resulted in an \n88% growth in registrations in the following year (OECD 2006: 17). In June 2005, a \n  14further liberalisation occurred when the AFNIC board decided to open up dot fr to private \nindividuals to register third level domains (that is a domain sold under the second level \ne.g. .co.fr under dot fr (ibid). It is also clear that a much more market-oriented approach \nis being developed by AFNIC. In 2005, it launched a brand image survey, a procedure for \nthe selection of publicity agencies and began to draft a new communications plan. It also \ncreated a series of relations support measures with the French registrar business, \ninvolving meeting them, consultation to determine their expectations and assembling a \nnetwork of AFNIC correspondents in them to deal with information dissemination and \nfeedback (AFNIC 2005: 12-13). AFNIC has also set up \u2018technical, marketing and \ncommunications working groups and legal workshops\u2019 (Weill 2005: p7). These would \nappear to be classic non-hierarchical governance measures. \nAFNIC also claims to rely on recommendations made by two \u2018consultative \ncommittees\u2019 which meet regularly to discuss the major avenues of development and the \nstructural choices envisaged by AFNIC (AFNIC 2005: 9). AFNIC has an ADR procedure \nwhich draws on the World Intellectual Property Organization\u2019s Universal Disputes \nResolution Policy. Since 2006, AFNIC and the Internet Rights Forum have operated the \n\u2018Mediateur du Net\u2019 service (AFNIC 2007), though disputes have also been dealt with in \nthe French courts particularly since liberalization of the ccTLD has occurred. An \nimportant further liberalizing change appeared to occur in 2007, when the French \nTelecommunications regulation, which sets out the basic principles relating to domain \nname governance, was modified to introduce a future selection procedure which is likely \nto involve the French minister for electronic communications choosing the company to \nact as the registry for dot fr. This suggests the creation of periodic competition to become \nthe registry and was described as a profound change to the French ccTLD regulatory \nenvironment by the AFNIC president (Gorichon 2007: 6). It appears that the French \nmodel, due to the pressures of the global market in ccTLDs, has developed towards an \noperating environment resembling a liberal, non-hierarchical subcontracting model, with \nthe state, nevertheless, still playing a strong role in setting the formal conditions under \nwhich AFNIC can operate and maintaining a strong presence on its board of mangement.       \nThe UK ccTLD provides an example of a very liberalized and commercially \nsuccessful entity, the closest to our \u2018voluntary action\u2019 category, but perhaps more \naccurately described as \u2018market-based\u2019 governance because of the possibility of the \ngovernment intervention that looms in the UK internet economy should self-regulation be \ndeemed to have failed. In July 2007, there were six million registered domain name \nholders under dot uk and it was reported that UK users were six times more likely to opt \nfor the dot uk TLD as the dot com generic TLD (Nominet 2007). Dot uk was first \nadministered on a voluntary basis in the 1980s by an organization known as the Naming \nCommittee. As the 1990s proceeded, the domain name selling industry grew in \ncommercial stature and it was decided that the management of domain names through the \nby now well-established registry functions needed to be organized differently. As a \nconsequence, the dot uk registry, Nominet, was created in 1996 as a private not-for-profit \n(that is, cost neutral) concern (Nominet 2007) over which its members have ultimate \ncontrol. In 2006, Nominet initiated steps to create a voluntary independent code of \npractice in which it aimed to act as a facilitator of discussions between different parties \ninvolved in the domain name business (Nominet 2006). Nominet adopts a highly \ncommercial approach to its activities. For example, in 2005, it undertook a \u2018brand\u2019 re-\n  15launch involving an attempt to improve its commercial image and, in 2006, appointed a \ndirector of marketing and communications with the aim of analyzing its current and \nfuture market to develop a better knowledge of  \u2018purchasing and renewal behaviours\u2019. An \ninteresting goal is the pursuit of \u2018thought leadership\u2019, where the registry aims to express \nviews on key issues. Nominet has declared itself interested in \u2018bring[ing] together \ndifferent stakeholders to encourage solutions, debate and discussion through dialogue and \ninformation sharing\u2019 (Nominet 2006: 7). Nominet has recognized the tension existing in \nits governance role between balancing \u2018the requirements of stakeholder participation with \nthe need to make decisions within acceptable timescales\u2019. It has declared a wish to be an \n\u2018informed and sensible commentator\u2026promoting self-regulation and an enabling \nenvironment for innovation and growth\u2019 (Nominet 2006: 9). It has argued that its \u2018unique \nposition in the internet industry in the UK means that it has to liaise frequently with, and \nattempt to influence, government\u2019 (Nominet Council of Management 2002a: 1).  \nIn 2002, the then Nominet Council of Management called for the creation of a UK \ndomain industry code of practice (Nominet Council of Management 2002b). Nominet has \na Policy Advisory Board which was created initially to allow a channel of \ncommunication from Nominet\u2019s membership to its Board, \u2018a forum for honing policy and \na formal mechanism for member consultation\u2019 though it now contains a wider \nrepresentation from UK industry and government (Nominet Policy Advisory Board \n2007a: 1). The Nominet PAB at the time of writing contains a member of the UK \ngovernment Information Commissioner\u2019s office, the UK Department of Trade and \nIndustry and the UK All Party Internet Group (Nominet Policy Advisory Board Reports, \n2007a and b). The recently created PAB Code of Conduct defines the PAB\u2019s role as \n\u2018assist[ing] with policy decision-making at Nominet\u2019 where the PAB is seen as a \nrepresentative body for interests \u2018who include Nominet and its staff, its members, .uk \ndomain name registrants, internet users, the PAB members\u2019 employers, or the \norganizations they represent, fellow PAB members\u2026civil society, industry and the \ngovernment\u2019 (Nominet Policy Advisory Board 2007c: 1). Clearly government is only one \nactor among a wide miscellany in this advisory only body. \nRecent research by Geist (2003: 4) found that \u2018virtually every government that \nresponded\u2026either manages, retains direct control, or is contemplating formalizing its \nrelationship with its national ccTLD\u2019. The evidence from Europe presented above \nsuggests a much more complex picture in which governments, whilst taking a keen \ninterest in the development of their ccTLD, have taken pains to organize its governance \nin a non-hierarchical fashion which aims to create a negotiated position between different \nnational public interest penchants and the features of Internet governance developed at \nthe international level. In the consequent governance models, (quasi) private actors play \nthe key roles. The voice of private interests in ccTLD governance was certainly clearly \nevident in the response to Geist\u2019s survey by CENTR, the European peak level \norganization for ccTLD registries. The report was claimed to be \u2018misleading: insisting on \nthe involvement of governments on the Internet denies the crucial part the private sector \nplayed historically and the one it still has today in the growth and continued stability of \nthe Internet\u2019 (pg 3.). CENTR went even as far as to claim that \u2018without substantiation by \nthe facts, it appears that [Geist\u2019s] report has simply been written to encourage \ngovernments to take over the running of their ccTLD registry\u2019 (CENTR 2004: 1-2).  \n \n  16Conclusions \nThe, albeit preliminary, findings in this paper have implications on a conceptual level, in \nterms of the characterisation of governance for the Internet, and also a practical policy \nlevel, in terms of the efficacy of the ccTLD regulatory regimes evolving in different parts \nof Europe. Theoretically, it seems that in the case of governing the ccTLD sector in \nEurope the prediction that governmental activity would be sidelined has turned out to be \ngrossly inaccurate in practice. The regulatory regime for ccTLDs has, on a general level, \nstrongly featured non-state, private actors operating within a broader public-private \nnetwork, with a contrasting role for the state in terms of direct and indirect involvement, \nand the separation of administration and policy, as is illustrated above. At the very least, \nour evidence demonstrates that the state is exercising a presence in the form of a \nshadowing role, even though the level and nature of that presence is characterised by \nvariation along the governance spectrum (see Table 1).  \nThe case of ccTLD governance provides an important piece of evidence on how new \nmore flexible and devolved non-hierarchical regulatory governance is being practised in \nrelatively novel policy domains. In the case of ccTLDs, we see a form of private interest \n\u2018management\u2019 and \u2018stewardship\u2019, which is governance. Here the pursuit of public interest \ngoals, on the one hand, is evident: protection of information and intellectual property \nrights of individuals and corporate public and private entities; promotion of \u2018national\u2019 \nInternet presence; an attempt to preserve a ccTLD as some form of collective \u2018resource\u2019 \nto be used by the so-called \u2018Internet community\u2019. On the other, the ccTLD in Europe is a \ncommercial phenomenon in which image and marketing, growth in terms of the number \nof registrations, issues like customer service, efficiency, corporate accountability and \naccrual of capital through enterprise for future investment are considered to be measures \nof success.  \nWithin each of these \u2018public interest\u2019 and \u2018neo-liberal-commercial\u2019 dimensions, the \nstate clearly has a vested interest in creating a successful, robust and efficient \nenvironment. However, the decision made by the state has been to devolve the mechanics \nof activity related to this to the private domain occupied by the ccTLD registry, registrar \ncompanies and ADR providers. This model represents a clear step beyond the kind of \nwell-recognized \u2018regulatory state\u2019 capitalism which, whilst at one remove from the state, \nhad largely hierarchical features, with a strong steering role still remaining in terms of \nadministration and management. In addition, the highly competitive global ccTLD \nmarket \u2013 there are many alternatives for users in deciding which TLD they register their \nname under \u2013 has meant that governance of ccTLDs is predominantly moving towards \nmore flexible, non-hierarchical governance. For government, this is manifest in new \ngovernance terms as \u2018gardening\u2019 in the case of the UK, but more \u2018hybrid\u2019 governance in \nthe case of Norway, Switzerland and France. In the latter cases, the public sector \npresence still can provide a steering role, albeit within a more liberalized and devolved \n\u2018subcontracting\u2019 context.  \nAn important research question raised by the modes of regulatory governance \nidentified within our case studies is the extent to which the evolving systems have proven \nefficacious. Wigger and Nolke (2007: 506) argue that the professional and technical \ncharacter of private interest regulation makes it more difficult to criticize whilst, in such \nsystems, \u2018the use of an apolitical image serves to hide the wider consequences of new \nregulation, thereby preventing the mobilization of negatively affected groups\u2019. There \n  17have been cases of attempts to abuse ccTLDs where the registry has had to resort to the \nformal legal system. Elsewhere, registries have documented cases where the ADR \nprocess has settled disputes between parties satisfactorily and others still, notably in \nFrance, where agreement has been reached in cases of conflict before convening an ADR \npanel was considered necessary. Thus far, it does appear that the system has functioned \nwith sound practical efficacy. Zielonka (2007: 204-05) argues that non-hierarchical, \ndecentralized systems of governance may promote enhanced deliberation reducing the \nlikelihood of abuses of power and accountability where \u2018different centres watch each \nother\u2019s moves and publicize abuses of power. Enhanced deliberation also contributes to \naccountability because issues are considered in more depth by a variety of actors\u2019. \nHowever, in the case of ccTLDs, the more commercialization proceeds, the greater is the \nprospect that public interest issues will struggle to maintain a presence. For example, \nwhilst a reduction in requirements for registration may reduce red tape and bring the \ncosts, and thus the price, to users of registering under a domain name down, this may also \nreduce the ability to curb the kinds of crime related to ccTLDs which may make them \nunattractive to users. There have also been examples of unfair commercial behaviour on \nbehalf of registrars, where those with direct access to databases have been able to \ndetermine names whose renewal date is close with a view to acquiring them immediately \non expiry because of their commercial potential (OECD 2006: 7). Another practice is to \nuse the ability to query the system to buy up valuable names when a new second level \ndomain is introduced. This then increases the cost to those wishing to purchase the \ndomain in the secondary market (ibid: 22).  \nIn any event, it is clear that ccTLDs provide an interesting example of a form of \n\u2018new\u2019 governance in which the presence of the state has been far from abandoned. \nRather, in Europe, the state sits at the margins of a series of non-hierarchically ordered \nsystems which, in operational and managerial terms, have been entrusted to private \ninterests. This is distinctly different from merely creating a free market governed by \ncompetition law \u2013 instead the ccTLD registry, privately ordered, non-profit-making yet \nunderpinned by a commercial ethos plays a key governance role in the functioning, but \nalso the evolution, of the sector in question. The system relies on a balance between the \nfunctional dynamism and managerial efficacy of the registry, on the one hand, and its \nwillingness to listen to the advice given by the often pluri-interest characterized advisory \nboards which often monitor sectoral activity. Much will hinge on the extent to which the \npluri- and multi stakeholder governance characteristic of the Internet\u2019s recent \ndevelopment can survive in an increasingly commercial and competitive domain name \nmarket. \n  18References \nAFNIC  - Articles of Association.

A budget working group within the ccNSO is therefore still working on \n\u2018providing ccTLDs with costs associated to ICANN in performing IANA functions that are in the interest \nof ccTLDs\u2019.  \n3 Details of those ccTLDs that have signed an agreement with ICANN can be found at: \nhttp:\/\/www.icann.org\/cctlds\/agreements.html  \n4 Other works in this context have focused on the enduring role of the state in economic policy more \ngenerally (Hirst and Thompson 1996), whilst others still emphasise, in governance terms, the role states \nplay in (re) producing and sustaining the global order (Rosenau and Czempiel 1992) and the close \nrelationship between states and markets in the process of globalisation (Germain 1999; Held et al 1999) . \n  22"}
