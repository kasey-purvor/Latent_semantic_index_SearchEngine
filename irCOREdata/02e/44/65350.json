Introduction\n[2] Multipath propagation in radio channels has long\nbeen considered the main impairment for high data rate\ntransmission. The presence of multipath in a time vary-\ning environment causes intersymbol interference, fre-\nquency selectivity and time fading. Examples of\ntechniques that limit these effects include diversity\n(antenna, frequency and time), smart antennas, coding\nand modulation schemes such as orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiplexing (OFDM). While these techniques\nattempt to combat the effects of multipath, an alternative\ntechnique, which exploits the presence of multipath to\nenhance the data rate in a limited spectrum was proposed\nby Winters [1987] and Foschini [1996]. The technique\nwidely termed as multiple input multiple output (MIMO)\nuses multiple transmit and multiple receive antennas and\nrelies on the decorrelation of the radio channels between\nthe antenna elements to transmit parallel data streams.\nThe concept of MIMO was first introduced by Winters\n[1987] for two basic communication systems. The first\nwas for communication between multiple mobiles and a\nbase station with multiple antennas and the second was\nfor communication between two mobiles each with\nmultiple antennas. Subsequently, the papers of Foschini\n[1996] and Foschini and Gans [1998] presented the\nanalytical basis of MIMO systems and proposed two\nsuitable architectures for its realization known as vertical\nBLAST, and diagonal BLAST. The basic motivation was\nto increase the data rate in a constrained spectrum. The\ninitial application of MIMO was envisaged for indoor\nWLAN, fixed wireless access networks, wireless local\nloop, and building-to-building wireless communications.\nLater other applications were proposed such as metro-\npolitan voice\/data wireless networks (UMTS, EDGE,\nand fourth-generation networks), very high speed fixed\nand mobile wireless (point to multipoint), acoustic com-\nmunications, and broadcast systems (HDTV).\n[3] For ideal conditions, that is independent and iden-\ntically distributed (IID) flat Rayleigh fading channels\nbetween the different antenna elements and constrained\ntotal power, such a technique is expected to increase the\ndata rate linearly with the number of receive antennas\n[Foschini, 1996]. In addition, the data are transmitted in\nbursts, such that the channel can be assumed quasi-\nstationary and that the channel is known at the receiver\nthrough the transmission of a training sequence [Hassibi\nand Hochwald, 2003] but not necessarily at the trans-\nmitter. MIMO is a narrowband concept where the\nassumption of flat fading holds, and therefore, the major-\nity of the channel capacity expressions are given for the\nnarrowband case. Essential to this assumption is the\nmeasurement of the coherent bandwidth of the channel.\nThe wideband case or the frequency selective channel\nrepresents the average capacity of the narrowband chan-\nnels across the bandwidth, which can provide frequency\ndiversity. However, real radio channels can deviate\nRADIO SCIENCE, VOL. 44, RS5015, doi:10.1029\/2008RS004095, 2009\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.\n2School of Engineering, Durham University, Durham, UK.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0048-6604\/09\/2008RS004095$11.00\nRS5015 1 of 14\nsignificantly from the IID model and the channel capac-\nity can vary significantly with the antenna array type and\ngeometry. Therefore, experimental characterization of\nsuch propagation channels is fundamental to the deploy-\nment of MIMO technologies.\n[4] Through a number of indoor MIMO measurements\nwe aim to examine some of the characteristics of the\nwideband time-variant MIMO channels for two different\nbandwidths in the 2.2\u20132.5 GHz band using different\nantenna configurations. The two frequency bands are\nintended for wideband digital video broadcasting sys-\ntems and for the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM)\nband which supports a number of wireless standards for\nwireless local access networks primarily proposed for\nindoor office and home environments. The environments\nunder test were chosen to cover a variety of propagation\nconditions such as line of site (LOS) and obstructed line\nof site (OLOS) in three of the BBC TV studios and the\nSchool of Engineering at Durham University, which is\nrepresentative of an indoor to indoor environment.\n[5] The paper briefly describes the sounder used in the\nmeasurements including the antenna arrays, the process-\ning of the data and presents results for capacity estimated\nfor different antenna configurations. Capacity variations\nas a function of distance on a grid of 8 by 8 m show the\nvariations in the studio environment every 2 m. The\ncorrelation between capacity and angular spread at both\nends of the link is obtained from double directional\nmeasurements from the 6 by 8 directional antenna arrays.\nIn addition, as OFDM MIMO is a strong candidate for\nfourth-generation systems, second-order statistics such as\nlevel crossing per MHz and average bandwidth of\nfrequency selectivity are presented.\n2. Measurement System\n[6] The measurements were performed using a custom\ndesigned chirp channel sounder which uses direct digital\nfrequency synthesizers (DDFS) for the generation of the\nchirp signal at both the transmitter and receiver. The\nchirp technique which has been long used for radar and\nionospheric sounding has the advantage of avoiding high\npeak transmission power, high bandwidths with band-\nwidth compression through the use of heterodyne detec-\ntion and flexibility in processing the acquired data with\ndifferent time and frequency resolutions [Salous, 1986].\nApplication to mobile radio channel measurements\nbecame feasible with the introduction of high-speed\nsynthesizers (DDFS) and large field programmable gate\narrays which enabled the design of a compact signal\ngenerator [Salous et al., 1998]. The DDFS avoids the fly\nback transients of phased locked loops and provides wide\ntransmission bandwidths at high waveform repetition\nfrequency (WRF) necessary to accommodate the high\nDoppler shifts in mobile radio environments. The band-\nwidth compression at the receiver enables the use of low\ndata acquisition rates and multiple receive channels\n[Salous and Hinostroza, 2005; Salous et al., 2005a].\nThe sounder used in the measurements combines the\n400 MHz wide bandwidth synthesizer reported by Salous\nand Hinostroza [2005] with the parallel receive architec-\nture of Salous et al. [2005b]. The updated sounder has a\nprogrammable chirp bandwidth up to 240 MHz and\nwaveform repetition frequency (WRF) up to 250 Hz for\nsingle input single output configurations. It has a single\ninput multiple output (SIMO) architecture where the\ntransmitter has a single output and the receiver has eight\nparallel receive channels (see Figure 1a). MIMO mea-\nsurements are enabled by employing a fast switch to\nsequentially transmit on each antenna for the duration of a\nsingle chirp waveform. To identify the sequence of\ntransmission the switch has an idle state as shown in\nFigure 1b. Hence for nT transmit antenna array, the\nrepetition rate of the sounding is reduced by a factor\nequal to nT + 1.\n[7] The present configuration can accommodate up to\n8 by 8 MIMO measurements and provides a minimum\nunambiguous Doppler coverage of \u00b125 Hz for four\ntransmit antennas with a WRF of 250 Hz. For indoor\nenvironments this is sufficient as 25 Hz Doppler shift\ncorresponds to a maximum walking speed of 3.75 m\/s.\nDual band 4 by 4 MIMO measurements at 2.2 GHz and\n5.8 GHz are enabled through up and down converters\n[Salous et al., 2005b]. Calibration data are collected in\naddition to the measurement data in order to compensate\nfor the differing channel gains in postprocessing.\n[8] The measurements reported here were performed\nwith 4 by 4 discone antenna arrays designed for the\nfrequency range between 2.1 and 6 GHz with different\nconfigurations including uniform linear array and circu-\nlar array as shown in Figure 2a. The discone antennas\nwere calibrated at 2 GHz in an anechoic chamber using a\nspecially designed quadrature unit to measure the mag-\nnitude and the phase [Feeney, 2007]. The polar diagram\nfor the four-element discone ULA is shown in Figure 2b,\nwhile the polar diagram for one of the elements of the\nUCA is displayed in Figure 2c with element 4 of the\nULAwith l\/2. Figures 2b and 2c show that the different\nelements affected each others radiation pattern as the\narray was rotated. This is expected as the elements\nobstructed each other for certain angles of arrival\/angles\nof departure.\n[9] The measurements in the ISM band (2.38 GHz) were\nall performed indoor on two floors in the School of\nEngineering at Durham University as shown in Figure 3.\nThe measurements were collected with 240 MHz band-\nwidth and the following antenna configurations: (1) Floors\n2a and 3a: 2 transmit by 2 receive (10250 impulse\nresponses), 3 transmit by 3 receive (9500 impulse re-\nsponses), and 4 transmit by 4 receive (11000 impulse\nRS5015 RAZAVI-GHODS AND SALOUS: MIMO IN TV STUDIOS\n2 of 14\nRS5015\nresponses) all with ULA; 4 transmit (UCA) 2 receive ULA\n(10000 impulse responses); 2, and 3 transmit ULA by\n4 receive UCA (10000, and 5500 impulse responses,\nrespectively). (2) Floors 2a and 2b: 4 transmit by 4 receive\nUCA (11000 impulse responses).\n[10] Another set of measurements was performed in\nthe School of Engineering floor 2b, using 6 by 8 antenna\narrays with directional arrays at both ends of the link\ndesigned to provide full 360\u0002 coverage. The data were\nprocessed for both MIMO capacity and for angular\nspread information to study the relationship between\nMIMO capacity and angular spread at both ends of the\nradio link. The 6 array element and its radiation pattern\nare shown in Figures 2d and 2e. All the antenna arrays\nused in the measurements reported herein have vertical\npolarization. The mutual coupling in the horizontal and\nFigure 1.

For the dicsone arrays, the mutual\ncoupling was measured to be \u000217 to \u000218 dB in the band\nof interest.\n[11] The data were acquired in blocks of 1 s, which\nconsisted of 250 impulse responses simultaneously on\neight channels. The environment of the TV studio\nmeasurements is shown in Figure 4 where a total of\n37500 impulse responses were collected using the\n4 ULA by 4 UCA discone array with 96 MHz bandwidth\nat 2.25 GHz.\n3. Data Processing\n3.1. Sounder General Processing\n[12] The data can be processed to estimate a number of\nchannel functions as required. In the present study the\ntime variant transfer function, the power delay profile,\nand the delay Doppler function were determined. In the\nchirp sounder, the received IF output of each receive\nchannel consists of beat notes for each multipath com-\nponent. For MIMO operation, the data are initially\ndemultiplexed, and then spectrum analyzed using the\nfast Fourier transform to obtain the time variant impulse\nfunction. In this stage only half of the data points are\nsaved due to the even symmetry. A second FFT per-\nformed on each complex impulse function yields the\ncomplex time variant transfer function, whereas a second\nFFT on each time delay bin gives the time delay versus\nDoppler spectrum.\n3.2. MIMO Capacity Estimation\n[13] The MIMO channel matrix data acquired from the\nmeasurements can be represented as a four-dimensional\ncomplex transfer function matrix, H, the size of which is\nFigure 2.

The data were\nacquired while the receiver was not in motion over 1 s\ntime intervals with an average of 50 sweeps per antenna.\nThe capacity estimates therefore represent a time average\nrather than a spatial average.\n[14] The evaluation of link capacity can provide a\nmeasure of the channel\u2019s upper bound limit on achiev-\nable data rate. The capacity of a frequency selective\nMIMO channel can be expressed as the average of Nf\nfrequency flat subchannels as given in equations (1) and\n(2) where equation (2) is the average of the conventional\nMIMO capacity expression for narrowband channels\n[Paulraj et al., 2003].\nCWB \u0004 1\nNf\nXNf\ni\u00bc1\nC\n\u00f0i\u00de\nNB \u00f01\u00de\nCWB \u00bc 1\nNf\nXNf\ni\u00bc1\nlog2 det InR \u00fe\nr\nnT\nHiH\nH\ni\n\u0002 \u0003\u0004 \u0005\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere r denotes the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nand Hi is the nR \u0003 nT matrix containing the sampled\nchannel transfer functions for each of the subchannels.\n[15] Prior to the computation of the channel capacity,\nthe MIMO channel matrix data are normalized to remove\na)\nb)\ne)d)\nc)\nFigure 4.

In this study the channel matrices\nwere normalized so that the Frobenius norm is equal to\nnRnT, which gives an average SISO gain of one [Jenson\nand Wallace, 2004]. Normalization of each individual\nsampled channel matrix to have a SISO gain of one,\nassumes some form of power control, which allows the\nreceiver to always have the same SNR, regardless of path\nloss. A more practical approach estimates an average of\none over all SISO gains, thus assuming an average SNR.\nIf b represents the normalization constant for each time\nsnapshot and fn represents the frequency sample index\n(frequency bin), the specified unity power gain constraint\nmay be expressed as [Wallace et al., 2003]\n1\nNf \u0005 nRnT\nXNf\nfn\u00bc1\nXnR\ni\u00bc1\nXnT\nj\u00bc1\nbH^\nfn\u00f0 \u00de\nij\n\u0006\u0006\u0006 \u0006\u0006\u00062 \u00bc 1 \u00f03\u00de\nSolving for b gives\nb \u00bc 1\n, ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1\nNf \u0005 nRnT\nXNf\nfn\u00bc1\nXnR\ni\u00bc1\nXnT\nj\u00bc1\nH^\n\u00f0fn\u00de\nij\n\u0006\u0006\u0006 \u0006\u0006\u00062\n !vuut \u00f04\u00de\n3.3. Correlation Analysis\n[16] MIMO channel capacity is dependent on the\ncorrelation between the different antenna elements at\nboth ends of the link [Loyka, 2001; Loyka and Kouki,\n2001]. Here, the correlation coefficients are defined\nusing Hi,j\n(k), which is the kth channel frequency bin in\neach transfer function from the jth transmit element to the\nith receive element [Maharaj et al., 2005; Eugene et al.,\n2004]. Therefore the correlation coefficient at the receiver\nwith particular element spacing is defined as\ngd;RX \u00bc\nXNf\nk\u00bc1\nXnT\nj\u00bc1\nXnR\u0002d\ni\u00bc1\nH\n\u00f0k\u00de\ni;j H\n\u00f0k\u00de*\ni\u00fed;jffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiXNf\nk\u00bc1\nXnT\nj\u00bc1\nXnR\u0002d\ni\u00bc1\nH\n\u00f0k\u00de\ni;j\n\u0006\u0006\u0006 \u0006\u0006\u00062\n !

The transmit correlation coefficient is calculated by\ninterchanging the roles of the transmitter and receiver\n[Maharaj et al., 2005].\n3.4. Angular and Time Delay Spread\n[17] The 6 by 8 data were analyzed using the SAGE\nalgorithm [Fleury et al., 1999] to estimate the angle of\ndeparture and angle of arrival. Since the data were\nacquired with a high time delay resolution sounder, the\ntime delay estimate was obtained from the power delay\nprofile, i.e., after the first FFT. Multipath components\nwithin a certain threshold level from the maximum of the\nprofile were selected and their time delays were entered\ninto the SAGE algorithm. The algorithm then estimated\nthe angle of arrival or angle of departure of these\nmultipath components and their signal strength. The data\nwere calibrated prior to the use of the estimation of\nangular information for antenna gain and for channel\ngains between the different receive channels. An exam-\nple is shown in Figure 5a for the 6 by 8 antenna array\nmeasurement. The angular information was subsequently\nused to estimate the RMS angular spread at both ends of\nthe link. The data were also processed for RMS time\ndelay spread for 20 dB threshold level for each receive\nantenna, and the average from all the antennas was then\nobtained.\n4. Measurement Results\n4.1. ISM Band\n4.1.1. Results for Discone Antenna Arrays\n[18] An example of the delay\/Doppler function for a\nLOS 4 by 4 is displayed in Figure 5b which shows a delay\nspread of about 50 ns and 8 Hz Doppler for a moving\nreceiver. The estimated mean RMS time delay spread for\nthese measurements varied between 22 and 29 ns for the\ndifferent antenna configurations.\n[19] The MIMO capacity for the different antenna\nconfigurations was computed for 2 by 2, 2 by 4, 3 by\n3, 3 by 4, 4 by 2 and 4 by 4 from repeated field trials.\nThe results for the cumulative distribution of capacity for\n30 dB SNR are displayed in Figure 6a with the capacity\nas a function of SNR in Figure 6b (see Table 1 for\nsummary of the median capacity).\n[20] Figure 6a shows that for the same number of\ntransmit and receive antennas, a nearly linear increase\nin capacity is achieved (the median capacity is 16.65,\n23.88 and 31.2 b\/s\/Hz for 2 by 2, 3 by 3 and 4 by 4). The\neffect of antenna diversity is shown to increase the\ncapacity. For example for the 2 by 4 antenna configu-\nration the median capacity was 20.1 b\/s\/Hz, which\nincreased to 26.7 b\/s\/Hz for the 3 by 4 antenna config-\nurations. Comparing the 2 by 4 and the 4 by 2 median\ncapacity it is seen that a reduction of 2 b\/s\/Hz has\noccurred in the latter, which is contrary to normal\nexpectation since the mobile radio channel is ideally\nreciprocal. However, this reduction can be attributed to\nthe transmit switch isolation which was measured to be\nonly 20 dB. This highlights the benefit of using separate\nreceiver channels as opposed to a single switched\nreceiver channel as commonly used in fully sequential\nsounders [Schwarz et al., 1993]. The results in this\nsection confirm that an indoor environment provides\nsuitable multiplexing capacity gain. The added capacity\nRS5015 RAZAVI-GHODS AND SALOUS: MIMO IN TV STUDIOS\n7 of 14\nRS5015\n\u0001 \u0001 a)\nb)\nFigure 5. (a) Angle of departure\/angle of arrival extracted from 6 by 8 measurement.

In Figure 6c a normal distribution,\noverlaid on the probability density function for the 4 by\n4 MIMO capacity displayed in Figure 6a is seen to\nprovide an appropriate fit to the data.\n[21] To study the effect of antenna separation, a set of\ndata files collected at 10 different locations with antenna\nspacing equal to l\/3, l\/2, l and 3l\/2 were analyzed.\nThe capacity and correlation coefficient at both ends of\nthe link were computed. The results indicate that an\nincrease in capacity is achieved as the antenna elements\nseparation is increased. For l\/3 spacing the capacity is\non average reduced by 2 b\/s\/Hz as compared to l\/2\nspacing. This could be attributed to a reduction in spatial\ncorrelation and reduced coupling between the antenna\nelements.\na)\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001        b)\nc)\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001       d)\nFigure 6.

It was found\nthat in the case of 4 by 4 LOS the capacity was reduced\nby, as much as 10 b\/s\/Hz from the average 31.2 b\/s\/Hz\nshown in Figure 6a.\n4.1.2. Results for Six by Eight Directional Antenna\nMeasurements\n[23] The data obtained with the double directional\nantennas were analyzed for MIMO capacity as displayed\nin Figure 6d, for correlation at the transmitter and for\ncorrelation at the receiver, and for angle of arrival and\nangle of departure. Correlation analysis showed values\nbetween 0.1 and 0.67 at the transmitter with a mean\nvalue of \u00060.3 and between 0.26 and 0.57 at the receiver\nwith a mean of \u00060.42, and mean RMS time delay spread\nwas found to be on the order of 106 ns.\n[24] Using the expression for the capacity C = n log2(1 +\nr\nn\n(1 \u0002 rc)) (n is the minimum number of transmit\/receive\nantennas and r is the signal-to-noise ratio) given by Loyka\n[2001] for the uniform correlation model rc = r, and\nexponential correlation model rc = r2 and taking the higher\nmean value of r = 0.42 and 30 dB signal-to-noise ratio\nthe corresponding estimated capacities are 39.7 b\/s\/Hz\nand 42.7 b\/s\/Hz, respectively. The model derived by\nLoyka [2001] was based on correlation between antenna\nelements of linear arrays whereas the arrays used in the\npresent study were directional and mounted on a circle.\nTherefore, the application of the model to our results is\nonly indicative of the maximum expected capacity. Never-\ntheless the achieved capacity of 50 b\/s\/Hz is higher than\nthe maximum capacity of 44.3 b\/s\/Hz achieved by setting\nrc = 0. This increase can therefore be attributed to the\ndiversity gain of using 8 antennas at the receiver instead of\n6 antennas.\n[25] Similar to the computations of the RMS delay\nspread, the RMS angular spread was computed from the\nangle of departure\/angle of arrival and the mean RMS\nangular spread for 20 dB threshold at both ends of the\nlink was found to be on similar order (68.5\u0002 angle of\ndeparture) and (69.7\u0002 angle of arrival). The correlation\ncoefficient was also computed between the capacity and\nthe RMS angular spread. The results are 0.65 and 0.41\nbetween capacity and angle of departure and capacity\nand angle of arrival, respectively. Although the mean\nRMS angular spread is relatively significant the correla-\ntion between capacity and RMS angular spread is less\nobvious with relatively low figures at both ends of the\nlink. Generally for low angular spread it is necessary to\nincrease the separation between the antenna elements. In\nthe simulations conducted by Shiu et al. [2000] to study\nthe effect of angular spread and array geometry on\ncapacity, it was concluded that the uniform linear array\nwith broadside angle of arrival gave higher results for\ncapacity than the inline angle of arrival or the hexagonal\narray. This however, was assuming a single ring model\nwith a high base station and a mobile unit. The high\nangular spread achieved in the current measurements\ncompensates for the closeness of the antenna elements,\nwhich gives a high capacity.\n4.2. Results for BBC TV Studios\n[26] For the BBC measurements, the data were classi-\nfied as line of sight versus obstructed line of sight and the\nresults for the 2.25 GHz frequency band are shown in\nFigure 7. In contrast to the ISM band results the mean\nRMS time delay spread was 13 ns for the LOS and 26 ns\nfor the OLOS.\n[27] The median measured capacity for the different\nantenna combinations are compared in Table 1 which\nshow a decrease in the capacity for the LOS case, in\ncomparison to the OLOS. The OLOS capacity is close to\nthe IID capacity of 17.97 b\/s\/Hz and 31.9 bits\/s\/Hz for\n30 dB SNR and for the 2 by 2 and 4 by 4 antenna\nconfigurations, respectively. Although the presence of a\nLOS component enhances the SNR which increases the\ncapacity of a SISO\/SIMO channel, the presence of a\ndominant LOS component results in a relatively small\nRMS time delay spread which in turn gives lower MIMO\nchannel capacity.\n[28] Since the data were collected systematically along\na grid, the capacity estimates could be studied for spatial\nvariations. Figure 8 shows the capacity estimates for\nlocations separated by 2 m on an 8 by 8 m grid for both 2\nby 2 and 4 by 4 antenna arrays, where spatial variations\non the order of 2 to 5 b\/s\/Hz can be observed. These can\nresult from the presence of obstructions such as furniture\nor equipment.\n4.3. Frequency Selectivity of MIMO Channels\n[29] MIMO configurations are currently being\ndeployed for WiMAX systems which employ orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in a bandwidth\nwhich varies from 1.25 MHz to 20 MHz in a number of\nfrequency bands in the 2\u20136 GHz range. For such\nsystems the effect of frequency selectivity has been\nshown to increase the bit error rate, BER [Salous et\nal., 2008; Khokhar and Salous, 2008]. Two parameters,\nwhich can indicate the effect of frequency selectivity on\nthe BER were introduced and these were the level\ncrossing and the average bandwidth of frequency selec-\ntivity. The data in the present study were also analyzed to\nestimate these parameters for the different antenna con-\nfigurations. Figure 9 displays the number of crossings\nper MHz and the normalized average bandwidth for\nwhich the data fell below a certain level in dB for both\nthe BBC data and for the ISM data. Generally it can be\nseen that for the BBC studio data more level crossings\nper MHz were detected than in the ISM data. This is\nassociated with a lower percentage of the bandwidth\nfalling below the same threshold. For multicarrier sys-\nRS5015 RAZAVI-GHODS AND SALOUS: MIMO IN TV STUDIOS\n10 of 14\nRS5015\ntems, the overall percentage of the bandwidth that falls\nbelow a certain level results in a higher BER as more\ncarriers suffer from a low signal level. For the ISM band,\naround 27% of the bandwidth fell below the 6 dB level in\ncontrast to 21% of the bandwidth for the BBC data.\n5. Conclusions\n[30] Wideband MIMO measurements in two different\nenvironments were performed using a chirp channel\nsounder with switching at the transmitter and parallel\nreceiver channels. The data were collected with either\n96 MHz bandwidth or 240 MHz bandwidth with 4 by\n4 uniform linear array or uniform circular array with\ndiscone antennas and with 6 by 8 directional antennas.\nThe data were classified in a number of ways, which\nincluded LOS versus OLOS, stationary versus moving,\nand on a spatial grid. The results indicate that the indoor\nradio channel provides spatial multiplexing capacity\nclose to the ideal except for line of sight situations where\na significant drop on the order of 11 bits\/s\/Hz can result.\nThe high-capacity results were related to the low corre-\nlation coefficients on the order of 0.3\u20130.42 at both ends\nof the radio link. Angular spread on the order of 68\u201369\u0002\nwas also estimated from the 6 by 8 data, which showed\nsignificant capacity due to both the increase in number of\nantennas and the diversity gain. The correlation between\nangular spread and capacity was higher for the angle of\ndeparture than the angle of arrival with 0.65 in compar-\nison to 0.42.\n[31] The median capacity obtained in the ISM band\ninside the School of Engineering building at Durham\nUniversity gave comparable results to the OLOS situa-\ntion in the TV studios for the same number of antennas.\nThese were 16.32 and 30.54 bits\/s\/Hz for the TV studio\nand 16.5 and 31.2 bits\/s\/Hz for the School of Engineer-\ning for the 2 by 2 and 4 by 4 antenna array config-\nurations. The spatial capacity on a 2 by 2 m grid can be\nsignificantly varied while the movement of one end of\nthe link results in a higher capacity. Finally the data were\nanalyzed to estimate the frequency selectivity properties,\nFigure 7.
