This paper is focused on\nthe processes occurring within the beach. The measurements provide the shape of the\nwetting front and the groundwater table and reveal the behavior of air in the unsaturated\nregion of the beach. Air is initially at atmospheric pressure, but the pressure builds up\nwhen air becomes encapsulated between the saturated region formed below the swash and\nthe groundwater table. For the 1.5 mm beach, entrapped air significantly affected the\nwater exchange between the swash and the subsurface. The considerable buildup of\ninterstitial air pressure reduced vertical hydraulic gradients and thus infiltration rates.\nAt the lower end of the beach the hydraulic gradients even became negative, indicating\nflow reversal and exfiltration. In contrast, for the 8.5 mm beach the rate of infiltration\nwas only slightly affected by the buildup of pore\u2010air pressure. The vertical hydraulic\ngradients were more than twice the magnitude of those within the 1.5 mm beach. The\nresults presented in the paper clarify the mechanisms that drive and impede the water\nexchange between the surface and subsurface flow. In particular, infiltration into the\ninitially unsaturated part of the beach and the resulting air entrapment play a significant\nrole in swash and similar flows.\nCitation: Steenhauer, K., D.

Res., 116, C04013, doi:10.1029\/2010JC006789.\n1. Introduction\n[2] The swash zone is the region periodically submerged\nas waves run up and down the beach, linking the ocean and\nthe coastal aquifer, and playing a significant role in cross\u2010\nshore and longshore sediment transport processes. The\nswash zone, considered to be the most dynamic region of the\nbeach, is a complex system which is affected by several\ninterrelated processes. In the past several decades our\nunderstanding and modeling of the bulk characteristics of\nswash zone hydrodynamics has progressed significantly.\nHowever, the smaller\u2010scale processes are not yet well\nunderstood. A key issue is the exchange of water between\nthe flow above and within the beach, which occurs via\ninfiltration into the beach or exfiltration from it.\n[3] Turner and Masselink [1998] were among the first to\ninvestigate the effects of infiltration\/exfiltration on sediment\ntransport in the swash zone using a field study. Seepage\nalters the effective weight of sediment [Nielsen, 1992] and\nalso affects bed shear stress [Puleo and Holland, 2001] by\nthinning (infiltration) or thickening (exfiltration) the bottom\nboundary layer of the swash flow [Conley and Inman,\n1994]. Infiltration increases the effective weight of the\nsediment and therefore impedes its transport, but may also\nincrease the bed shear stress, thereby promoting sediment\ntransport. Nielsen [1997], Turner and Masselink [1998], and\nButt et al. [2001] included the two processes, i.e., bed sta-\nbilisation\/destabilisation, and the boundary layer alteration\ninto a modified version of the Shields parameter, consider-\ning the net effect on sediment transport of these (opposing)\nmechanisms across saturated beds in the swash zone. Butt\net al. [2001] define a threshold with regard to a critical\nsediment size and\/or hydraulic conductivity below which\ninfiltration and exfiltration promote offshore transport and\nabove which infiltration and exfiltration promote onshore\ntransport. Infiltration also induces swash flow asymmetry.\nAs a result of water being lost to the beach the uprush\nwater flux is greater than the backwash flux, thus reducing\nwater volume and shortening the duration of the backwash\n[Austin and Masselink, 2006]. This flow asymmetry, which\nincreases for coarser beaches, causes an asymmetry between\nthe net uprush and net backwash sediment transport.\n1School of Engineering, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.\n2Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Hong Kong\nUniversity of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong.\nCopyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/11\/2010JC006789\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 116, C04013, doi:10.1029\/2010JC006789, 2011\nC04013 1 of 17\nResearchers generally agree that infiltration and exfiltration\nprocesses are likely to increase onshore transport on coarser\nbeaches [e.g., Horn and Li, 2006], which in turn affects the\nbeach slope. Thus the coarser the material, the greater the role\nthat has been played by infiltration and the steeper the beach\n[Bagnold, 1940; Masselink and Li, 2001].\n[4] Infiltration into the beach is driven by the weight of\nthe surface water. In the upper, initially unsaturated region\nof a coarse\u2010grained beach the infiltrated water forms a\nwetting front, which advances by replacing the air within the\nvoids of the porous material with water until the front\nreaches the groundwater level (Figure 1). Air entrapped\nbetween the wetting front above and the groundwater table\nbelow can significantly impact the infiltration and exfiltra-\ntion process in natural beaches [Horn, 2002, 2006]. Soil\nstudies found that air entrapment greatly reduces the\nhydraulic conductivity and hence decreases the infiltration\nrates [Constantz et al., 1988; Faybishenko, 1995].\n[5] Most previous research into swash zone processes has\ninvolved sandy beaches (typically around d50 = 0.5 mm),\nbut relatively little attention has been given to coarse\u2010\ngrained beaches. Horn [2006] identified important research\nquestions related to the subsurface hydrodynamics in the\nswash zone, such as the variability of hydraulic conductiv-\nity, air entrapment, the effects of pressure gradients, infil-\ntration and exfiltration processes on sediment transport, for\ncoarse\u2010grained beaches in particular. A lack of knowledge is\nespecially apparent when it comes to the influence of the\nunsaturated and partially saturated region above the\ngroundwater table on flow and pressure distribution within\nthe beach.\n[6] In complex field conditions it is difficult if not\nimpossible to isolate and study the key processes affecting\nswash on beaches; this is best achieved through controlled\nlaboratory experiments. For the present study, in which we\nstudy infiltration and exfiltration processes, we conduct\nexperiments on a permeable but immobile beach of known\npermeability. So far, to the authors\u2019 knowledge, the only\nprevious laboratory experiments carried out on a permeable\nand immobile bed are those reported by Lara et al. [2006].\nHowever, those experiments focused on hydrodynamics in\nthe surf zone, not swash.\n[7] The aim of the present work is to improve funda-\nmental understanding of the interaction between bore\u2010driven\nswash and the subsurface flow within the beach. The main\nparameters which control this interaction are the beach\nsediment size (determining beach permeability and rough-\nness) and the initial groundwater level within the beach. The\ninfluence of these parameters is investigated by conducting\na series of large\u2010scale laboratory swash experiments on\npermeable immobile beaches. This paper reports the surface\nand subsurface flow measurements, focused on the infiltra-\ntion, exfiltration and pressure behavior within the permeable\nbeach during swash.\n[8] The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes\nthe laboratory setup for the large\u2010scale experiments of bore\u2010\ndriven swash on permeable, but immobile coarse\u2010grained\nbeaches, detailing the test facility and measurement techni-\nques. The experimental results are discussed in sections 3\u20136.\nSection 3 presents the main features of the surface and\nsubsurface flow during the uprush and backwash stages of\nthe swash cycle, including water profiles and time series of\nwetting front, infiltration rates and infiltrated volume.\nSection 4 focuses on pressure within the beach, with special\nattention paid to the effect of air encapsulation within the\nunsaturated region of the beach. In section 5 the results from\nthe sections 3 and 4 are used to evaluate the vertical\nhydraulic gradients during the swash cycle. Section 6 pre-\nsents the response of the groundwater to infiltration. Finally,\nsection 7 summarizes and concludes this paper.\n2. Experimental Methodology\n2.1. Test Facility\n[9] The facility consists of a 20 m long, 0.9 m high, and\n0.45 m wide, glass\u2010sided flume with a water reservoir at one\nend (Figure 2). A gate fronting the reservoir can be raised\nvery quickly to produce a plunging wave. A bore is gen-\nerated which propagates to the beach and leads to swash\nexcursions of magnitude typical of natural beaches. Swash\nevents produced by the test facility have excellent repeat-\nability [O\u2019Donoghue et al., 2010].\n[10] In the majority of experiments the reservoir was filled\nto a depth of 0.60 m producing an approximately 0.25 m\nhigh bore with a velocity of approximately 2 m\/s at the toe\nof the beach. The bore travels horizontally along the bottom\nFigure 1. A bore\u2010driven swash event.\nFigure 2. The swash facility.\nSTEENHAUER ET AL.: SUBSURFACE PROCESSES GENERATED BY SWASH C04013C04013\n2 of 17\nof the flume before running onto a 1:10 beach located 4 m\ndownstream of the reservoir, producing swash excursions\nranging from 3 to 4 m depending on the beach material.\n[11] The beach was made of sediment throughout its\ndepth with the top 30 mm bonded by a dilute water\u2010cement\u2010\nsediment mix (ratio of approximately 1:2:67 by weight),\nthereby maintaining the permeability and roughness but\npreventing the sediment from moving. The experiments\ninvolved two beach materials: one with nominal diameter\nd = 1.5 mm and another with d = 8.5 mm. Samples of the\ntwo sediment types are shown in Figure 3.\n2.2. Characterizing the Porous Media\n[12] The hydraulic resistance to the flow through the two\ntypes of granular material was investigated using a pur-\npose\u2010built constant head apparatus which consisted of a\n185 mm diameter cylinder with 405 mm high sediment\nsample. Figure 4 shows these measurements in the form of\nhydraulic gradient, I, versus the Darcy velocity, uD,\ndefined as the ratio of discharge and the cross\u2010sectional\narea of the apparatus.\n[13] The same apparatus was used to measure the\nhydraulic resistance of the two granular materials with a top\nlayer bonded by cement. Figure 4 shows that the measure-\nments with the cement\u2010sediment layer (triangles) agree\nwell with those of the original sediment samples. This\nproves that the sediment bonded by cement maintained, up\nto the range of experimental error, identical hydraulic\nresistance as the original sediment.\n[14] The Forchheimer resistance law, I = aKuD + bKuD\n2\n[Fand et al., 1987], was fitted to the data shown in Figure 4.\nThe resulting Forchheimer coefficients were aK = 81.2 s\/m,\nbK = 3587 s\n2\/m2 for the 1.5 mm sediment, and aK = 4.1 s\/m,\nbK = 383 s\n2\/m2 for the 8.5 mm sediment.\n[15] The finer sediment is an order of magnitude less\npermeable than the coarser sediment.\n2.3. Experimental Conditions\n[16] The main experiments were designed to explore the\neffect of the beach permeability on the water exchange\nbetween surface and subsurface flow, for typical initial\nbeach conditions with the groundwater table close to the\nmean seawater level and an unsaturated beach above this\nlevel. The two main experimental series were therefore\nperformed with different sediment and otherwise identical\nparameters: water depth in the reservoir H0 = 600 mm;\ninitial surface water depth in front of the beach h0 = 62 mm;\ninitial groundwater level within the beach h0 = 62 mm.\nFigure 5 illustrates the setup in a Cartesian system with\nx and z coordinates in the horizontal and a vertical direc-\ntions, respectively, and with the origin at the initial shoreline\nposition. Time t = 0 corresponds to the opening of the\nreservoir gate.\n[17] For the coarser 8.5 mm sediment no capillary fringe\nwas detected above the groundwater table, whereas for the\n1.5 mm sediment the thickness of the capillary fringe was\nevaluated at 50 mm. Above the groundwater table\/top of the\ncapillary fringe the beach saturation corresponded to fully\ndrained conditions (drainage by gravity). These fully\ndrained conditions with the horizontal groundwater table are\nsomewhat idealized, since the groundwater table in natural\nbeaches usually has a bulge underneath the swash zone. The\nidealized initial conditions were necessary for maintaining\nrepeatability of swash events.\n[18] Two additional experiments were carried out, one\nwith an initially fully saturated beach, and one with a\nstronger bore generated by a water depth in the reservoir of\nH0 = 700 mm.\n[19] Table 1 lists the main experimental conditions for all\nfour experiments. Each experiment has a name which pro-\nvides a code for the main conditions: \u201cR60\u201d and \u201cR70\u201d\nmean H0 = 600 and H0 = 700 mm, respectively; \u201cPER\u201d and\n\u201cSAT\u201d mean initially unsaturated and saturated beach,\nFigure 3.

Details of these measurements are presented later in\nthis section. Experimental runs were repeated in order to\nobtain ensemble\u2010averaged results. Between subsequent runs\nwater that infiltrated into the beach had to be drained to\nensure identical initial conditions for repeated runs. Figure 6\nshows the recovery period recorded by a transducer posi-\ntioned below the initial groundwater level at x = 2780 mm\nfor both beaches. The recovery period was determined by\nrecording the water level in the saturated area of the beach\nprior, during and after a single swash run. Lower perme-\nability resulted in a much longer recovery time for the\n1.5 mm beach, of approximately 60 minutes, compared to\napproximately 6 minutes for the 8.5 mm beach.\n2.4. Surface Flow Measurements\n[21] A series of detailed surface flow measurements were\nundertaken using LIF to measure the swash depth and PIV\nto measure instantaneous velocity fields. The LIF (1M b\/w)\nand PIV (2M b\/w) digital cameras captured images of the\nflow, which was illuminated by a Nd YAG Laser and\ncontained fluorescent dye and seeding particles. The two\nmeasuring techniques of the surface flow are discussed in\ngreater detail by G. A. Kikkert et al. (Experimental study of\nbore driven swash hydrodynamics on impermeable slopes,\nsubmitted to Experiments in Fluids, 2011).\n[22] Simultaneous depth and velocity measurements were\ncarried out at several cross\u2010shore locations for the 1.5 and\n8.5 mm beach (Figure 5). In order to obtain accurate\nvelocity statistics the number of repeats was as large as\npractically feasible: 50 for the 8.5 mm beach and 15 for the\n1.5 mm beach, the latter reduced for practical reasons, i.e.,\nbecause of the much longer recovery period.\n[23] To capture most of the surface flow profile (the\nso\u2010called swash lens), additional swash depth measurements\nfor the 1.5 and 8.5 mm beach were carried out at multiple\ncamera positions along the beach (8 and 12 camera positions\nfor the 1.5 and 8.5 mm sediment, respectively). Ensemble\naverages of swash depth are more stable than velocity sta-\ntistics, so it was sufficient to have a fewer number of repeats\n(10 for the 8.5 mm beach and 8 for the 1.5 mm beach).\n[24] In the experiment with the reservoir depth of\n700 mm, swash depth was measured only at the cross\u2010\nshore locations with the vertical arrays of pressure trans-\nducers, and the number of repeats was 10.\n[25] For all LIF and PIV measurements the duration of\nthe recording was long enough to capture the entire swash\nevent of 10 s; the sampling rate was 13.5 Hz.\n[26] Only the ensemble\u2010averaged depths are presented\nin this paper. More detailed results of the surface flow\nmeasurements are presented by Kikkert et al. (submitted\nmanuscript, 2011).\nFigure 5.

Pressure Measurements\n[27] Pressure transducers were used to measure the pres-\nsure at a series of locations within the beach. The setup for\nthe 1.5 mm beach is shown in Figure 5. The arrangement for\nthe 8.5 mm beach was very similar. The transducers were\npositioned in vertical arrays midway between the surface\nflow PIV\/LIF measurement locations.

The remaining transdu-\ncers were placed above Pi0, at the same cross\u2010shore locations,\nso that they were above the initial groundwater level in all\nexperiments except R60SAT015. They are labeled Pij, with j\nindicating the vertical position of transducer within the profile\n( j = 1 is the shallowest position and j increases downward).\nThe number of transducers Pij within the individual profiles\nwas variable. Table A1 in Appendix A presents the trans-\nducers\u2019 positions for the beaches.\n[28] Two types of pressure transducer were used: Druck\ntransducers and in\u2010house built transducers. All transducers\nhave a length of approximately 60 mm and a diameter of\napproximately 30 mm. The Druck 4\u201320 mA gauge (series\nPTX 7533) has a pressure range between 0 and 100 mbar.\nTheir overall performance, repeatability and accuracy is\nvery good with an error of approximately 0.15% of the\nwhole range (equivalent to an error of 1.5 mm water depth).\nThe main electronic component of the in\u2010house transducer\nconsists of either a Honeywell 26PC01SMT 70 mbar range\nsensor or Sensortechnics RQOP005D 300 mbar range sen-\nsor. The sensor component of the in\u2010house transducer had\nthe biggest error, with approximately 1% of the whole range,\nwhich is equivalent to an error of 7 mm water depth for the\nHoneywell sensors and 30 mm water depth for the Sensor-\ntechnics sensors. For both types of transducer the errors were\nsignificantly reduced by calibration over the required pressure\nrange. The calibration was performed in situ, by filling the\nflume and recording pressures for knownwater depths. Further\nreduction of error was achieved by ensemble averaging over\nthe repeated runs, as explained below.\n[29] The data acquisition software (VI Logger) controlled\nthe timing and the sampling rate of the pressure transducers\nconnected to the acquisition board (National Instruments\nDAQPad\u20106016) of the pressure system. Pressure signals\nfrom 50 individual swash runs (16 in the case of the initially\nfully saturated 1.5 mm beach, R60SAT015) were recorded,\nwith a duration of 30 s and sampling frequency 135 Hz, i.e.,\n10 times the rate of the PIV\/LIF system. Figure 7 shows\nexamples of the ensemble\u2010averaged voltage signals together\nwith the individual signals for a transducer of the 1.5 mm\nbeach. A time series of the root mean square error (rms) of\npressure for each transducer was used for extracting an\naverage value of RMS over the duration of the swash cycle.\nFigure 6. Drainage of the beach after an experimental run shown as a pressure signal at x = 2780 mm\nwithin the 1.5 (grey line) and 8.5 mm (black line) beach in experiment R60PER015 and R60PER085,\nrespectively. Initial groundwater level is indicated by the horizontal dashed line.\nFigure 7.

All RMS values fall\nwithin the range of 0.5\u20132.5 mm.\n2.6. Wetting Front Measurements\n[30] The movement of the water\/air interface within the\nbeach was recorded through the glass sidewall of the flume.\nThe weakness of the method is that the movement of the\nwetting front at the wall may be somewhat altered by the\nwall effect. However, these measurements provided useful\ninsight into the shape and speed of the wetting front. Fur-\nthermore, the explicit tracking of water proved helpful for\ninterpreting the pressure measurements. The digital camera\n(2M b\/w) recorded flow images over an area with dimen-\nsions approximately 200 \u00d7 300 mm (1200 \u00d7 1600 pixels),\ncapturing the propagation of the wetting front from bed\nsurface until it reached the top of the capillary fringe or the\ngroundwater level.\n[31] Image analysis started with subtracting the initial\nimage, showing the porous material prior to the swash event,\nfrom all subsequent images. A two\u2010step MATLAB algorithm\nwas then used to identify the interface between the saturated\nand unsaturated region of the beach. Figure 8 shows examples\nof the wetting front and groundwater position across the\nrecorded image detected by the algorithm for the 1.5 and\n8.5 mm beach. The crosses represent the result of the first\nstep, which consists of detecting the first pixels where the\nintensity is greater than a predetermined tolerance value. For\nthe 1.5 mm sediment searching is performed over pixel col-\numns in the bottom\u2010up direction, whereas for the 8.5 mm\nsediment it is done over pixel rows, from right to left. The\nsignal obtained in this way is noisy, so the second step of\nthe algorithm applies a Savitzky\u2010Golay filter which results in\nthe data shown as the solid line in Figure 8. The right\u2010to\u2010left\ndirection of searching used for the 8.5 mm sediment allowed\ndetection of the groundwater level. However, it also produced\na series of erroneous points near the right edge of images for\nall time instances when the tip of the wetting front has gone\npast the image. These points can be seen in Figure 8 (right).\nThey were ignored in all subsequent calculations.\n[32] The detection of the front could not be achieved at\npixel resolution because of the low contrast and high noise of\nthe images. It was estimated that the error in vertical position\nof the wetting front is of the order of the sediment diameter. In\nthe 1.5 mm beach a capillary fringe of approximately 50 mm\nabove the initial groundwater level was present, i.e., the\nfront could not be tracked within this region of the beach.\nFurthermore, it was not possible to detect the upper edge of\nthe saturated region above the wetting front which forms at\nearly stages of the backwash.\n[33] Dynamic Studio v1.45 (DANTEC Dynamics) was\nused for data acquisition, timing and controlling the sam-\npling rate of the wetting front images. The wetting front\nrecordings were performed at a series of cross\u2010shore loca-\ntions (12 positions between x = 1023 and 4242 mm, i.e.,\naround maximum runup, for the 1.5 mm beach and 7 posi-\ntions between x = 1313 and 3179 mm, i.e., around maxi-\nmum runup, for the 8.5 mm beach). The number of repeats\nof the wetting front measurements at each location was\n4 for the 8.5 mm beach, and 2 for the 1.5 mm beach, the\nlatter reduced for practical reasons. The recording frequency\nfor the 8.5 mm beach was 13.5 Hz with a duration of 10 s.\nDue to low permeability, the recording frequency for the\n1.5 mm beach was 4.5 Hz and the duration was 30 s.\nFigure 9 shows wetting front measurements from repeated\nruns and the ensemble\u2010averaged wetting front at x =\n2608 mm at two selected times for the 1.5 and 8.5 mm\nbeaches. For each beach, one of the individual runs shown\nin Figure 9 (bottom) corresponds to an image in Figure 8.\nFigure 8. Wetting front detection at x = 2608 mm within the (left) 1.5 and (right) 8.5 mm beach of\nexperiment R60PER015 and R60PER085, respectively. Note that the direction of bore travel during\nuprush is from left to right. In the 8.5 mm beach it was also possible to detect the groundwater level\nbecause there was no capillary fringe above it.\nSTEENHAUER ET AL.: SUBSURFACE PROCESSES GENERATED BY SWASH C04013C04013\n6 of 17\n[34] Table B1 in Appendix B lists the x locations of the\ncenters of the camera views and the physical dimensions of\nthe camera views for the two beaches.\n3. Infiltration Into the Beach\n[35] Figure 10 shows a definition sketch for all relevant\nflow quantities presented in the remaining text.\n3.1. Water Profiles\n[36] During bore propagation water from the surface flow\ninfiltrated into the beach, forming a wetting front profile\nbelow the beach surface. Figure 11 shows water profiles\nacross the swash zone for both beaches. They consist of a\nsurface profile, showing the surface flow level, zh, and the\nsubsurface profile, which shows the position of the wetting\nfront, zf.\n[37] The different permeability of the two beaches results in\nvery different speeds of the wetting front. This is clearly\nvisible at t = 3.78 s, when the wetting front within the 1.5 mm\nbeach is very close to the beach surface for the whole sub-\nsurface profile, whereas in the 8.5 mm beach the wetting front\nhas reached the groundwater level over approximately half of\nthe profile (until x \u223c 1900 mm), and has traveled a significant\ndepth over the remaining 500 mm. These distinctly different\ndepths of penetration for the wetting front indicate that the\nvolume of water infiltrating into the 1.5 mm beach is con-\nsiderably smaller than for the 8.5 mm beach.\n[38] During uprush the most shoreward points of the\nsurface and the subsurface profiles are very close, with the\nformer moving slightly ahead. This means that close to the\nbore tip infiltration into the beach starts very quickly after\nthe bore arrival.\n[39] The location and time of maximum runup of the\nsurface flow are different for the two beaches: 4396 mm and\nt = 5.26 s for the 1.5 mm beach, compared to 3040 mm and\nt = 4.44 s for the 8.5 mm beach. The bore on the 1.5 mm\ntravels further and for longer than on the 8.5 mm beach for\ntwo reasons: the volume of water lost to the beach by\ninfiltration is smaller, and the less rough bed surface is less\nefficient in extracting momentum from the surface flow.\n[40] Careful inspection of the subsurface profiles for the\n8.5 mm beach at t = 3.78 s and t = 4.44 s reveals a slight\nelevation of the groundwater level, zh, below the wetting\nfront (few points at the base of the subsurface profile close\nFigure 9. Example of ensemble\u2010averaged wetting front (black line) and individual runs at x = 2608 mm\nfor two selected times within the (left) 1.5 and (right) 8.5 mm beaches in experiment R60PER015 and\nR60PER085, respectively. Note that the direction of bore travel during uprush is from left to right.\nFigure 10. Definition sketch for flow quantities.\nSTEENHAUER ET AL.: SUBSURFACE PROCESSES GENERATED BY SWASH C04013C04013\n7 of 17\nto z = 0). This elevation indicates a horizontal hydraulic\ngradient which generates groundwater flow in the shoreward\ndirection.\n[41] During backwash the intersection of the subsurface\nprofile with the beach face remains at a very high position.\nAt the same time the surface profile rapidly retreats so that\nthe shoreline position quickly travels down the slope. The\npart of the beach face between the two points (i.e., end of the\nsubsurface profile and the shoreline) becomes a so\u2010called\nseepage face, defined as the boundary where the saturated\npore pressures are atmospheric. The seepage face is clearly\nvisible at t = 6.44 s for the 8.5 mm beach.\n[42] Close to the end of the swash event the subsurface\nconditions within the two beaches are distinctly different. In\nthe 1.5 mm beach the wetting front remains above the top of\nthe capillary fringe (z = 50 mm) for the majority of the\nsubsurface profile. In contrast, in the 8.5 mm beach the\nwetting front has completely merged with the groundwater.\n3.2. Wetting Front Propagation\n[43] Infiltration into the beach at a particular cross\u2010shore\nlocation is presented as a time series of the wetting front\nlevel, zf(x, t), within the two beaches in Figure 12. Each time\nseries starts at the beach surface at the moment of bore\narrival at the particular location and shows how the wetting\nfront moves downward. The wetting front level within the\n1.5 mm beach decreased gradually in time, whereas the\nmovement of the wetting front within the 8.5 mm beach\ntracks a much steeper line and shows little sign of slowing\ndown during the swash cycle.\nFigure 11. Surface and subsurface water profiles at several selected times for the (left) 1.5 and (right)\n8.5 mm beach of experiment R60PER015 and R60PER085, respectively.\nSTEENHAUER ET AL.: SUBSURFACE PROCESSES GENERATED BY SWASH C04013C04013\n8 of 17\n[44] The wetting front is driven by the weight of water\nwithin and above the beach, i.e., the driving force is pro-\nportional to the vertical hydraulic gradient. As the wetting\nfront propagates, the air within the beach is replaced with\nwater. The fraction of the volume of voids available for\ninfiltration (effective porosity) is \u0001 = \u0001max \u2010 \u00010, where \u0001max\nand \u00010 are the maximum water content and the initial water\ncontent, respectively. In our experiments the effective\nporosity was evaluated from separate volumetric measure-\nments to be \u0001 = 0.3. This value and the time series of the\nwetting front speed (gradients of lines shown in Figure 12)\nwere used to determine the infiltration rates, q, within the\ntwo beaches as\nq x; t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc \u0001 dzf x; t\u00f0 \u00de\ndt\n: \u00f01\u00de\nFor the 1.5 mm beach, the infiltration rates are initially\nbetween 4 and 8 mm\/s and then decrease over time to become\nrelatively constant, at approximately 2 mm\/s. For the 8.5 mm\nbeach infiltration rates are between 30 and 60 mm\/s.\n3.3. Cumulative Volume of Water Penetrating\nInto the Beach\n[45] The surface flow loses water to the beach while\npropagating up and down the slope. The cumulative water\nflux across the beach surface was calculated using two\nindependent methods, one based on surface flow data, and\none based on subsurface flow data.\n[46] Simultaneous time series of depth and velocity were\nmeasured at several cross\u2010shore locations. The closest mea-\nsurement position to the initial shoreline position, x = 0 mm,\nwas xo = 72 mm. This location was therefore chosen for\nevaluating the discharge which entered the control volume\n(x > xo). Due to the air bubbles in the surface flow just after\nbore arrival there was a gap in the velocity data. Within this\nperiod (0 < t < t) it was assumed that too little time had\nelapsed for water to infiltrate into the beach, i.e., the infil-\ntration rate across the beach surface was zero during this\nsmall time. The volume of water lost to the beach at any\ntime t was calculated from continuity as the difference\nbetween the total volume that entered the control volume\nuntil t and the volume present on the beach surface at the\nsame time t, i.e., as\nVb t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nZ t\n\u0003\nu xo; t\u00f0 \u00deh xo; t\u00f0 \u00dedt \u0002\nZ x\u00bcxs t\u00f0 \u00de\nxo\nh x; t\u00f0 \u00dedx; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere h and u are ensemble\u2010averaged surface flow depth\nand depth\u2010averaged, ensemble\u2010averaged velocity, respec-\ntively, xs(t) is the shoreline position and t is the time at\nFigure 12. Time series of wetting front for the (left) 1.5 and (right) 8.5 mm beach at six cross\u2010shore\nlocations x = 1463 (crosses), 1763 (triangles), 2063 (pluses), 2378 (tilted triangles), 2608 (circles), and\n2838 mm (stars) of experiment R60PER015 and R60PER085, respectively.\nFigure 13. Cumulative volume of water within the (left) 1.5 and (right) 8.5 mm beach for experiment\nR60PER015 and R60PER085, respectively, based on subsurface measurements (triangles) and surface\nmeasurements (circles).\nSTEENHAUER ET AL.: SUBSURFACE PROCESSES GENERATED BY SWASH C04013C04013\n9 of 17\nwhich the velocity measurements started (t = 0.45 s for the\n1.5 mm beach and t = 0.55 s for the 8.5 mm beach).\n[47] For the second method time series of the subsurface\nprofiles across the beach were used to evaluate the cumulative\nvolume of water which has entered the beach at time t as\nVb t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nZ x\u00bcxweir\nx\u00bc0\nZ z\u00bczb x\u00f0 \u00de\nz\u00bc0\n\u0004 x; z; t\u00f0 \u00de\u0001dzdx; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere xweir is the position of the weir located downstream of\nthe beach at x = 6023 mm from the initial shoreline position\n(Figure 5), \u0001 is the effective porosity and g(x, z, t) is the\ndistribution function which takes the value 1 if the beach is\nsaturated at position (x, z), and is 0 otherwise.\n[48] The cumulative volumes of water which penetrated\ninto the beach from the surface flow during the uprush\nobtained using the two methods are compared in Figure 13.\nEncouragingly, the two independent methods have produced\nsimilar results for the two beaches. This also confirms that\nthe value of 0.3 for the effective porosity from the volu-\nmetric measurements is reasonable. By the time of maxi-\nmum runup the percentage of water volume that has\npenetrated into the beach of the total water volume that has\ncrossed the lower boundary of the beach was approximately\n20% for the 1.5 mm sediment and 45% for the 8.5 mm\nsediment. The infiltration result of the 8.5 mm beach is\nsimilar to field measurements undertaken on a 6 mm beach\nby Austin and Masselink [2006] and Masselink et al [2010].\nThey compared uprush with backwash discharges, and\nconcluded that approximately 50% of the uprush volume\ninfiltrated into the gravel beach.\n4. Pressure Within the Beach\n[49] Pressure measurements within the initially unsatu-\nrated beaches were carried out using transducers located\nat various depths below the beach surface (50\u2013448 mm,\nTable A1 in Appendix A). The air within the unsaturated\nregion of the beach is initially at atmospheric pressure.\nHowever, the arrival of the bore and the start of infiltration\nincrease the pressure as the air becomes entrapped below\nthe wetting front. The pressure transducers recorded the\npore\u2010air pressure, until the moment when the wetting front\nreached their location. Inspection of the wetting front pro-\nfiles presented earlier (Figure 11) shows that this occurred\nvery quickly in the 8.5 mm beach, but did not occur at all\n(for the duration of a swash event) in the 1.5 mm beach. As\na result, the majority of pressure measurements carried out\nin the 1.5 mm beach recorded only pore\u2010air pressure. This\nsection first discusses the pore\u2010air pressure measurements in\nthe 1.5 mm beach. This is followed by the pressure mea-\nsurements within the 8.5 mm beach. The concluding part of\nthe section is focused on horizontal air movement within\nboth beaches.\n[50] Figure 14 presents the time series of pressure head,\nrelative to the initial (atmospheric) pressure head, for the\nFigure 14. Pressure head time series at x = 1180, 1980, 2780, and 3780 mm for the initially unsaturated\n(dashed lines) 1.5 mm beach (R60PER015) and fully saturated (solid lines) 1.5 mm beach (R60SAT015).\nThe pressure head is expressed relative to the initial pressure. The results for the saturated beach show\nonly measurements of the bottom transducers, i.e., transducers P30 at x = 1180 mm, P40 at x =\n1980 mm, and P50 at x = 2780 mm. The time of bore arrival at each x location for the swash event on\nthe initially unsaturated beach is shown as a vertical line.\nSTEENHAUER ET AL.: SUBSURFACE PROCESSES GENERATED BY SWASH C04013C04013\n10 of 17\ninitially unsaturated 1.5 mm beach (dashed lines). At each x\nlocation there were several pressure transducers positioned\nat various depths below the wetting front during the whole\nof the swash cycle. The comparison between the individual\npressure head time series at the same location shows that\nthey very closely followed each other, i.e., due to the very\nlow air density approximately identical pressure variation\noccurred at different vertical locations. This, in addition to\nthe known location of the wetting front, also confirms that\nthese pressure transducers were indeed measuring pore\u2010air\npressure.\n[51] Figure 14 also shows the time series of pressure head\nmeasured by the bottom transducers at x = 1180, 1980, and\n2780 mm in the experiment R60SAT015, with the initially\nfully saturated beach and otherwise identical conditions\n(solid lines). The pressure head is expressed relative to the\ninitial pressure, i.e., the initial pressure head has been sub-\ntracted. Because the beach was initially fully saturated and\nthe infiltration rates were close to zero, the pressure head in\nthe subsurface closely followed the surface water depth. The\nsurface flow in the two experiments (R60SAT015 and the\nmatching experiment with the initially unsaturated beach,\nR60PER015) was very similar, so the results for pressure\ncan be compared between the two experiments. The pres-\nsure in the initially unsaturated beach did not simply follow\nthe surface water depth. Instead there was a significant\nbuildup of pore\u2010air pressure, which was of similar magni-\ntude to the surface depth itself. At the lower end of the beach\n(x = 1180 mm) the maximum pressure buildup corresponded\nto 150 mm of water, i.e., it was approximately 50 mm (50%)\nhigher than the maximum surface water depth. The inter-\nstitial air pressure buildup gradually diminished in the\nshoreward direction.\n[52] The pore\u2010air pressure builds up because air is pushed\nby the wetting front, and becomes encapsulated between the\nfront and the top of the capillary fringe. The additional pore\u2010\nair pressure creates a horizontal pressure gradient and hence\ngenerates interstitial air flow in the shoreward direction.\nIndeed, comparison of pressure magnitudes at two cross\u2010\nshore locations at any given time shows that there is always\na horizontal pressure gradient. As long as the volume of air\n(per unit time) replaced by the wetting front is larger than\nthe net horizontal air flux, pore\u2010air pressure increases further\nas the air gets compressed.\n[53] Figure 14 also shows that the bore arrival (shown\nwith a vertical line) always occurs slightly later than the\nbeginning of the pressure buildup, and this lag becomes\ngreater further up the slope. This is another consequence of\npore\u2010air pressure buildup at lower locations which causes\nshoreward movement of air and hence increases pore\u2010air\npressure slightly ahead of the bore tip.\n[54] Close to the end of the backwash, as the wetting front\npropagation slows down, the pore\u2010air pressure gradually\ndecreases. At the cross\u2010shore location x = 1980 mm at t\naround 9 s, close to the end of the backwash, the gradient of\nthe pressure time series suddenly increases indicating faster\nair release (than earlier at the same location, and simulta-\nneously, but further up the slope). The likely explanation is\nthat the relatively shallow surface water depth in the back-\nwash, combined with the still significant pressure of the\nentrapped air results in air escaping upward, straight through\nthe surface water. Figure 15 shows evidence of this: even\nduring the uprush pore\u2010air pressure within the 1.5 mm beach\nreaches sufficiently large magnitudes with respect to pres-\nsure at the beach surface to push the air into the surface\nflow. The release of air, indicated by the bubbles within the\nsurface flow, is channeled along preferential pathways\nthrough the sediment. Similar observations of air under\nwave runup onto unsaturated sand were also reported by\nTurner [1993]. This additional mechanism of air release\nadds considerably to the complexity of the water exchange\nbetween the surface and subsurface flows.\n[55] The pore\u2010air pressure buildup within the beach lasts\nuntil the end of the swash event (t = 10 s). At this stage the\nwetting front is still propagating toward the groundwater at\nmost locations (Figure 12), but the rate of propagation is\nmuch smaller thus allowing the air within the beach to\nnearly return to its initial atmospheric state (Figure 14).\n[56] At this point it is important to make a comment on the\napplicability of our laboratory results presented above to\nfield conditions. Our laboratory environment creates two\u2010\ndimensional surface and subsurface flow (in x, z plane), such\nthat pore\u2010air below the wetting front can move only in the\nshoreward direction. This corresponds to an idealized con-\ndition where the incident bore approaches a uniform beach\nslope normally. In such conditions air entrapment and\npressure buildup are expected to generate air flow ahead of\nthe incident bore. In realistic field conditions, air may be\nable to escape laterally due to nonlongshore uniformity of\nincident bore and beach slope and so the effect of air\nentrapment will be less pronounced.\n[57] In the 8.5 mm beach the wetting front rapidly reaches\nthe position of the transducers in the initially unsaturated\nzone of the beach, and from that point on they start to\nmeasure the increase in pressure as the result of the presence\nFigure 15. Air released during swash on the 1.5 mm beach\n(R60PER015) during (top) uprush and (bottom) backwash.\nThe view corresponds to an approximately 500 mm flow\nlength at cross\u2010shore location centered at x = 1500 mm.\nSTEENHAUER ET AL.: SUBSURFACE PROCESSES GENERATED BY SWASH C04013C04013\n11 of 17\nof water. It is therefore beneficial to present the pressure\nmeasurements in terms of hydraulic head (i.e., sum of the\nelevation and the pressure head) which determines the\ndirection of water movement.\n[58] Figure 16 presents time series of the surface water\nlevel and the hydraulic head within the 8.5 mm beach.\nFigure 16 (bottom) corresponds to the stronger swash event\nwith 700 mm reservoir depth, where larger surface water\ndepth and greater runup result in more pronounced changes\nof pressure within the subsurface than in the 600 mm\nexperiment. Prior to the bore arrival, the hydraulic heads in\nFigure 16, indicated by dashed lines, show the level at\nwhich the pressure transducers are buried in the bed. After\nbore arrival the time series of hydraulic head show two\ndistinct regions, one with moderate pressure buildup and\nanother one where the hydraulic head rapidly increases and\ntends toward the surface water level.\n[59] To interpret these results we consider the swash event\nwith the 600 mm reservoir depth, for which more complete\nmeasurements are available (Figure 16, top). Besides\nhydraulic heads and surface water levels, they also include\nthe time series of the wetting front position zf (lines with\ncircles) and the groundwater level zh (grey lines showing a\nslight increase above z = 0). The wetting front reaches the\nlevels of all individual transducers very quickly after bore\narrival. For some time after that, the pressure head variation\nat all transducers is moderate and closely follows the vari-\nation of the surface water depth. This is followed by an\nabrupt increase in the pressure head time series gradient,\nwhich occurs when the wetting front hits the groundwater\nlevel (close to 4 s for x = 1980 mm and soon after 5 s for x =\n2780 mm). From this moment on the hydraulic heads rap-\nidly increase until they reach the surface water level.\n[60] Despite much faster wetting front movement within\nthe 8.5 mm beach, compared to the 1.5 mm beach, the\ncorresponding buildup of pore\u2010air pressure is considerably\nlower: for the 8.5 mm beach the additional pressure head\ndue to air reaches a magnitude of approximately p\/(rg) =\n20 mm, compared to 150 mm for the 1.5 mm beach. This\nbehavior results from the easier air escape in the more\npermeable 8.5 mm beach.\n[61] The beginning of the pressure buildup and the\nmoment when the wetting front hits the groundwater can be\ndetected more precisely from the local maxima of the sec-\nond derivative of the pressure signal for the bottom pressure\ntransducers, shown in Figure 17. The timing of the first peak\ncoincides with the moment of the first response, i.e., the\narrival of the air pressure \u201cfront,\u201d while the second peak\nshows the moment when the wetting front hits the ground-\nwater. Figure 17 also shows the bore arrival time as a ver-\ntical line, confirming that in the 8.5 mm beach the pore\u2010air\npressure buildup starts somewhat before the bore arrival.\n[62] Figure 18 shows the comparison of the shoreline\npropagation along the beach with the corresponding prop-\nagation of the pore\u2010air pressure front for experiments of the\n1.5 and 8.5 mm beaches.

Vertical Hydraulic Gradients\n[63] Vertical hydraulic gradients indicate the driving force\ngoverning the rates of infiltration\/exfiltration and thus the\nwater exchange between the swash and the subsurface\nflow. In simulation models of swash [e.g., Clarke et al.,\n2004; van Gent, 1994] infiltration rates are often calcu-\nlated by assuming a gradient of 1. With the experimental\ndata presented in sections 3 and 4 it is possible to estimate\nthe hydraulic gradients and hence test this assumption.\nEvaluation of vertical hydraulic gradient has to consider\nthe build up of pore\u2010air pressure within the unsaturated\nregion. Assuming negligible capillary head at the wetting\nfront, the hydraulic gradient is expressed as\nI \u00bc \u0005gh\u00fe \u0005g zb \u0002 zf\n\u0002 \u0003\u0002 p\n\u0005g zb \u0002 zf\n\u0002 \u0003 ; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere h is the flow depth at the beach face, zf denotes\nthe level of the wetting front, zb is the level of the bed\nsurface, r denotes density of water, g is the gravitational\nacceleration, and p is the pore\u2010air pressure below the wetting\nfront in the unsaturated region of the beach, relative to\natmospheric pressure.\n[64] Another way of evaluating hydraulic gradients is to use\nthe Forchheimer coefficients determined on the separate rig\nfor the steady state flow (section 2.2) together with the infil-\ntration rates calculated from the wetting front measurements.\n[65] Figure 19 presents time series of the hydraulic gradient\nat several cross\u2010shore locations for the two beaches. Pluses\ncorrespond to the values obtained from equation (4) and\ncircles correspond to the values obtained from the For-\nchheimer equation. Values for the gradient are only deter-\nmined for times corresponding to when the wetting front is\nmoving. Positive gradients are associated with infiltration.\nThe results obtained using two independent methods for\nevaluating hydraulic gradients show encouraging similarity.\n[66] Hydraulic gradients in the 1.5 mm beach are much\nless than 1 at all locations, and for the lowest location x =\n1180 mm they even become negative, indicating exfiltra-\ntion. For this location the estimate based on the Forchheimer\nequation is omitted because the tracking of the upward\nmovement of the wetting front from the image analysis\nwas not sufficiently accurate for evaluation of gradients.\nExfiltration occurring at the lower end of the 1.5 mm\nbeach was first inferred from the pressure results shown in\nsection 4. Looking back at the subsurface profiles for the\n1.5 mm beach shown in Figure 11, we notice that the wet-\nting front tends to be shallower at the lower end of the\nbeach, although infiltration starts earlier and is driven by\nlarger surface depths than further up the slope. This means\nthat the wetting front is at some point in time pushed up\ntoward the beach surface, hence exfiltration is taking place.\n[67] For the 8.5 mm beach the values for the hydraulic\ngradients are always positive, i.e., infiltration occurs within\nthe 8.5 mm beach across the swash zone for both uprush and\nFigure 18.

Note that most cross\u2010shore locations\nhave a number of transducers and as a result markers denot-\ning the arrival of the pressure front overlap each other.\nFigure 17.

For a good part of the\nswash cycle the gradients are significantly higher than one\nand also more than twice the magnitude of the gradients\nwithin the 1.5 mm beach. The difference between the two\nbeaches results from the greater effect of air encapsulation in\nthe 1.5 mm beach, which significantly reduces vertical\nhydraulic gradients.\n6. Groundwater Response to Infiltration\nWithin 8.5 mm Beach\n[68] In the 1.5 mm beach the influence of the surface\nflow on the ambient groundwater during the swash cycle\nwas negligible, because the majority of infiltrated water\nremained within the top layer of the beach and did not\nreach the groundwater level by the end of the swash cycle\n(Figure 11). In the 8.5 mm beach, however, infiltration was\nrapid, and the wetting front reached the groundwater level\nacross majority of the swash zone during the uprush. The\nresulting response of ambient groundwater is discussed in\nthis section.\n[69] Groundwater levels were evaluated from the pressure\nmeasurements recorded by the transducers situated below the\ninitial groundwater level (Pi0). During a short period between\nthe time of bore arrival at a particular location and the time\nwhen the wetting front reaches the groundwater, the pressure\nmeasurements are dominated by the pore\u2010air pressure\nbuildup, which is bigger than the change in groundwater\nlevel. After this short period it is possible to select times\nwhen the pressures recorded by the lowest transducers are\nno longer affected by the increase in pore\u2010air pressure, and\nthe measured pressure head directly shows the groundwater\nlevel (if the beach is unconfined), or shows the hydraulic\nhead (if the beach is confined).\n[70] Figure 20 shows profiles of surface water, ground-\nwater and the wetting front at two stages of the swash cycle,\nFigure 19. Time series of hydraulic gradient (top and middle) at x = 1180, 1980, 2780, and 3780mm for the\n1.5 mm beach (R60PER015) and (bottom) at x = 1980 and 2780 mm for the 8.5 mm beach with the 600 mm\nreservoir depth (R60PER085) based on equation (4) (pluses) and the Forchheimer equation (circles).\nSTEENHAUER ET AL.: SUBSURFACE PROCESSES GENERATED BY SWASH C04013C04013\n14 of 17\noverlayed by a sketch of the inferred direction of ground-\nwater flow.\n[71] Figure 20 (top) shows the late uprush (t = 4.44 s). In\nthe lower part of the beach the wetting front has merged with\nthe groundwater (propagation of the wetting front prior to this\nmoment was shown in Figure 11). Further up the slope the\nwetting front is moving toward the groundwater. Groundwater\nlevels below the wetting front are slightly raised, due to infil-\ntration at the lowest end of the beach generating horizontal\ngroundwater movement. The overall shape of the groundwater\nprofile is similar to those shown by Austin and Masselink\n[2006], who inferred a dual pathway infiltration model from\nfield measurements of pressure in a 6 mm gravel beach. The\nonly difference is that in our experiments the wetting front was\ndirectly recorded, making it possible to measure its typical\nconvex shape and to locate the point where the wetting front\nmeets the groundwater level and the subsurface flow direction\nchanges from nearly vertical infiltration to nearly horizontal\ngroundwater flow.\n[72] Figure 20 (bottom) shows the late backwash (t =\n8.59 s). The surface flow has retreated, forming a seepage\nface. Groundwater flow diverges: at the lower end of the\nbeach the groundwater drains in the seaward direction (both\nthrough the seepage face and the submerged lowest end of\nthe beach face), whereas further into the beach it flows in the\nshoreward direction.\n[73] Figure 20 shows consistency in the experimental\nresults. Across the majority of the fully saturated part of the\nbeach the hydraulic heads within the beach evaluated from\nmeasured pressures (Pi0) show excellent agreement with the\nLIF surface level measurements. In the uprush (t = 4.44 s)\nthere is a single location (x \u223c 2000 mm) where the beach is\nsaturated, but the groundwater hydraulic head is not at the\nsurface water level; instead it is approximately at the beach\nface. The difference between the surface water level and the\ngroundwater hydraulic head indicates downward movement\nof infiltrating water. This observation point is close to the\nunconfined part of the beach, so the nearly vertical move-\nment which originated from the downward moving wetting\nfront is still significant. Seaward of this point the agreement\nbetween the pressure and surface level measurements con-\nfirms that the groundwater movement along this part of the\nbeach is nearly horizontal. Further shoreward the agreement\nbetween the groundwater levels evaluated from pressure\nmeasurements and the wetting front recorded using image\nanalysis is very good in both uprush and backwash.\n[74] For the purpose of modeling groundwater in the\nswash zone it is useful to define the position of the most\nshoreward, fully saturated (confined) cross section. This\ncross section, which we call the saturation boundary marks\nthe most shoreward location where groundwater is directly\nconnected to the surface water (i.e., swash lens). During\nuprush the saturation boundary is the cross section where the\nwetting front has just reached the groundwater level; during\nbackwash the saturation boundary usually coincides with the\nso\u2010called exit point, i.e., the point where the groundwater\ntable intersects with the beach face.\n[75] Figure 21 shows the position of the saturation\nboundary and the shoreline position throughout the swash\nFigure 20. Surface and subsurface profiles at two selected\ntimes for the 8.5 mm beach with the 600 mm reservoir depth\n(R60PER085). Thin black line indicates swash and thick\nblack line indicates the wetting front or groundwater level.\nThe point measurements of the pressure transducers are indi-\ncated by triangles. The saturated region within the beach is\nshaded.\nFigure 21. Time series of shoreline position (pluses) and saturation boundary (circles) for the 8.5 mm\nbeach with the (left) 600 and (right) 700 mm reservoir depth of experiment R60PER085 and R70PER085,\nrespectively.\nSTEENHAUER ET AL.: SUBSURFACE PROCESSES GENERATED BY SWASH C04013C04013\n15 of 17\ncycle, for the two 8.5 mm beach experiments (the 600 and\n700 mm reservoir depths). During uprush the saturation\nboundary moves shoreward, lagging slightly behind the\nshoreline position. After flow reversal, in the early stages of\nthe backwash, infiltration continues, so the saturation\nboundary can move slightly further shoreward. However,\nby the time the retreating shoreline has reached the saturation\nboundary, the beach begins to drain: this occurs at approxi-\nmately 7 s for the 600 mm reservoir depth and at approxi-\nmately 7.5 s for the 700 mm reservoir depth. A seepage face\ndevelops between the shoreline and the exit point, which\ngradually follows the bore tip in the seaward direction.\n[76] The fact that shoreline position and saturation\nboundary in Figure 21 are not coincident shows that\ngroundwater flow and surface flow are not fully coupled\n(i.e., they do not share a common boundary along the\nbeach face) at any stage of the swash cycle. This finding\nis not limited to highly permeable beaches. On the con-\ntrary, the decoupling is even more pronounced for less\npermeable beaches: for the 1.5 mm beach the saturation\nboundary remained very close to the initial shoreline\nposition throughout the swash cycle.\n7. Conclusion\n[77] New laboratory experiments have yielded detailed\nmeasurements of subsurface hydrodynamics resulting from\nbore\u2010driven swash on permeable immobile beaches. The\nexperiments were conducted on two beaches made of dif-\nferent size sediment (1.5 and 8.5 mm) with the same slope\nof 1:10. The following conclusions are drawn from the\nstudy:\n[78] 1. Beach grain size determines beach permeability\nand surface roughness and has a major effect on the surface\u2010\nsubsurface exchange and subsurface hydrodynamics.\n[79] 2. The wetting front pushes air within the unsaturated\nzone of the beach. In the presence of the ambient ground-\nwater the air becomes entrapped, and the pore\u2010air pressure\nincreases hence reducing infiltration rates.\n[80] 3. The pressure buildup results from the imbalance\nbetween the downward infiltration of water and the shore-\nward movement of air.\n[81] 4. In the 1.5 mm beach, air encapsulation played a\nmajor role in the water exchange between the surface and\nsubsurface flow. The interstitial air pressure buildup\ndecreased infiltration rate to such an extent that during the\nswash cycle the wetting front did not reach the top of\nthe capillary fringe across the majority of the beach.\nFurthermore, at the lower end of the beach entrapped air\nreversed the direction of the wetting front and caused\nexfiltration. In the same region some amount of air man-\naged to escape through preferential pathways straight into\nthe surface flow, during uprush and a good part of the\nbackwash.\n[82] 5. Air entrapment played only a minor role in the\n8.5 mm beach. The beach rapidly became fully saturated\nover the majority of the shoreline excursion.\n[83] 6. By the time of maximum runup, approximately\n20% and 45% of the incident water volume infiltrated the\n1.5 mm beach and 8.5 mm beach, respectively. Infiltration\nrates across the swash zone and for the entire swash cycle\ndiffered by an order of magnitude between the two beaches,\nwith average infiltration rates of approximately 5 mm\/s\nfor the 1.5 mm sediment and approximately 50 mm\/s for\nthe 8.5 mm sediment.\n[84] 7. Due to pore\u2010air pressure buildup, vertical hydraulic\ngradients in the 1.5 mm beach were relatively small, of the\norder of 0.5, and even negative at the lower end of the\nbeach. In the 8.5 mm beach the vertical gradients were\nconsiderably larger than unity for at least half of the swash\ncycle.\n[85] 8. The subsurface flow was distinctly different for the\ntwo beaches. In the 1.5 mm beach the majority of infiltrated\nwater remained within the top layer of the beach and did not\nreach the groundwater level during the entire swash event.\nIn the 8.5 mm beach infiltration was rapid with the wetting\nfront reaching the groundwater level at most cross\u2010shore\nlocations during the uprush.\n[86] 9. The results illustrate the complexity of subsurface\nflow behavior within coarse\u2010grained beaches in response to\nbore\u2010induced swash. They show that for coarse\u2010grained\nbeaches we have to consider both the infiltration into the\nunsaturated region above the groundwater level and the\nmovement of the ambient groundwater itself. Furthermore,\nboth wetting front propagation and groundwater movement\nare affected by air encapsulated within the unsaturated\nregion located below the wetting front and above the\ngroundwater level.\n[87] 10. These findings have important implications for\nmodeling swash zone processes: (1) air encapsulation has to\nTable A1.
