However, when the person has limited and idiosyncratic \ncommunicative abilities, it may be hard to gauge what his\/her own view of the matter \nis. We examine video-taped records of two episodes in which a staff member of a \ngroup home prompted a resident with profound intellectual disabilities to play a \nverbal and a non-verbal \"game\". We examine how the staff member in these two \ncases designs her actions to solve the dilemma she faces between, on the one hand, \nabandoning an activity when the resident does not provide clear indications that he \nwants to continue or, on the other hand, persisting with it until the resident begins to \nenjoy it or, at least, participate more fully. The solution lies in a pervasive institutional \npractice: treat resistance or ambiguity as temporary reluctance. We discuss these \ninteractions as examples of the dilemmas faced by \u2018street-level bureaucrats\u2019 (Lipsky, \n1980), in particular how principles of empowerment, inclusion and independence play \nout in the details of everyday interaction. \n2 \n \nThe dilemma for staff in \"playing a game\" with a person  \nwith profound intellectual disabilities: choice, inclusion and independence in \ninteractional practice \n \n \nThe recent UK Government White Paper \u2018Valuing People\u2019 (Department of Health, \n2001a) requires services for people with learning disabilities to promote \nindependence, inclusion, choice and control. When we think about what these values \nmean in practice, we tend identify areas of life in which they are most clearly visible \nor measurable using statistical indices. For example, we might talk about choice over \nwhere one lives or what one eats; independence in travelling, cooking or serving \noneself drinks; and inclusion in terms of the use of community facilities. While these \nare all important indices, there is a danger of neglecting the way in which all these \nissues are played out in more mundane areas in people\u2019s lives, at the level of actual, \neveryday interactions. Such sites are less amenable to statistical description perhaps, \nbut just as important to address. For example, inclusion is not just about being in \npublic spaces, but is also about respectful, mutual exchanges between individuals \nwhich are rewarding for both parties. Independence can be thought of as being able to \nact competently in particular communicative as well as physical environments. As \nsocial models of disability (eg Goodley, 2000; Oliver, 1990) have pointed out, if we \ndo not pay attention to how those environments are structured we can promote \ndependence through the insistence that business is conducted in a way that some \nactors find difficult or impossible. While this is recognized with respect to the \nprovision of information in accessible formats (eg symbols combined with text, audio, \nsimplified language), the implications are rarely drawn out to include people with a \nlexicon of only one or two words or symbols (Learning Disability Taskforce, 2004). \nFinally, choice and control are (or are not) exercised in interaction in countless ways \u2013 \nin how options are offered, in which utterances are and are not taken up, in whether \npeople\u2019s choice to initiate or terminate interactions are respected, in how people\u2019s \npreferences are recognized and treated, to name but a few (for examples, see <authors \nrefs>; Williams, 2006).   \n \n3 \n \nIn this paper, we focus closely on several exchanges between a support worker and a \nperson with profound learning disabilities, in order to see how these issues play out in \nthe details of their interactions. This is particularly important since it is people with \nsevere and multiple impairments who are most excluded, least independent, and most \nlikely to lack choice and control in their everyday lives (Department of Health, 2001a; \nHatton et al, 2004; HM Government, 2005; Kishi, Teelucksingh, Zollers, Park-Lee & \nMeyer, 1988; Learning Disability Taskforce, 2004; Stancliffe, Abery & Smith, 2000). \nTheir interactions with support staff are crucial to whether the values outlined in \nValuing People will be achieved (Social Exclusion Unit, 2005; Leaning & Watson, \n2006). Although some authors have done valuable work looking at how those with \nlimited formal communication might be supported in making choices (eg Beamer & \nBrookes, 2001;  Edge, 2001; Grove, Bunning, Porter & Morgan, 2000; Grove, \nBunning, Porter & Olsson, 1999; Lovett, 1996; Puddicombe, 1995; Sanderson, 1998), \nit is recognized that there is not enough training and information available about how \nto support people with severe and profound learning disabilities (Learning Disability \nTaskforce, 2004). \n \nThe type of interactions we examine here are games. Although we use the term \u2018play\u2019, \nthis is not supposed to imply childish activity. Rather, it is one aspect of the domain \nof activities which we find in all friendly or intimate human relations. When people \nare verbally fluent, they engage in a wide range of interactions that seem to have no \nobvious instrumental purpose, but rather are engaged in as part of sustaining relations, \nand which are often signalled as enjoyable by both parties (Nind & Hewitt, 2001). \nThis might include bantering, joking, singing, formal and informal games, story-\ntelling, gossiping and so on. When one or both parties has limited formal language, \nsuch exchanges are just as important in sustaining fulfilling social relations, but they \ncannot be based on spoken or signed language to the extent that we find when both \nparties are fluent speakers. In a service for people with limited linguistic abilities, the \nstaff, then, cannot rely on their usual ways of passing time with other adults. Despite \nthis, studies have found that staff and teachers still do use verbal communication in \nmany of their interactions, often posing questions and making statements in the course \nof their activities to which the people they are addressing do not appear able to \nrespond (Bradshaw, 2001; Hodapp, Evans & Ward, 1989; McConkey, Morris & \n4 \n \nPurcell, 1999; Puddicombe, 1995). However, as Williams puts it: \u2018An important \nachievement of support talk is to give people with learning disabilities the chance to \ntake on roles as full interactional partners\u201d (2006, p10). \n \nGames are important in services for people with limited formal communicative \nresources for two reasons. Firstly, they provide opportunities for interaction which is \nnot based on the institutional agendas of care or instruction. Potentially, therefore, \nthey provide moments when the support staff and the residents can interact with each \nother on a more equal footing, and where they can take pleasure in being together (see \nColes, 2001, Taylor & Bogdan, 1989, and Williams, 2006, for discussions of \n\u2018friendliness\u2019 in relationships of support). This potential for a more equal, non-\ninstitutional exchange is an aspect of social inclusion which is often neglected. \nSecond, participation in non-instrumental games and play allows the usual rules of \nlinguistic exchange to be suspended, at least temporarily, and the actors can try to \ninteract using communicative resources that might be more suitable for the purpose of \nsimply \u2018getting along\u2019. This suspension of the usual tyranny of words and meanings \npermits interaction in which people with limited formal language can be more \ncompetent (see Goode, 1994 for examples of this), and thus potentially exercise more \ncontrol over what is happening (see Puddicombe, 1995, p 10-11). Although the recent \ndevelopment of \u2018Intensive Interaction\u2019 (Nind & Hewitt, 2001) provides a framework \nfor promoting these types of interaction, the staff at the house in which our data was \ncollected were not trained in these techniques, and did not routinely practice them. \nRather, what we will see is the creative and spontaneous efforts by one member of \nstaff and one resident to interact using a range of verbal and non-verbal resources.  \nWe will focus particularly on how the actors respond to each other, and how the staff \nmember solves uncertainties in the meaning or purpose of the behaviour of the \nresident. In looking at this, we present an example of a \u2018street-level bureaucrat\u2019 \n(Lipsky, 1980; Hudson, 1993) using her discretion in the implementation of polices of \ninclusion and empowerment at the level of everyday practice. \n \nData  \nOur data are selected from a larger corpus (approximately 10 hours) of interactions \nthat were recorded by one of the authors (CW) on video as part of a nine month \n5 \n \nethnographic study of one National Health Service residential home in the UK. This \nhome, \"Ashgrove\" (all names are pseudonyms) had a staffing level of 4 members of \nstaff per shift and was home to 10 adults, aged between 34 and 53 years. The \nresidents of this home all experienced significant communication difficulties and all, \nto differing degrees, depended on the staff for various aspects of intimate care on a \nday-to-day basis. \n \nThe ethical procedures followed in the research were formulated in accordance with \nDepartment of Health guidelines for conducting research involving people with \nlearning disabilities (Department of Health, 2001b) and were approved via the NHS \nCentral Office for Research Ethics Committees (COREC) (now the National Research \nEthics Service (NRES)) process. Across all three sites, the research was mindful of \nvariability in individuals\u2019 capacity to consent (though see Dye & Burton (2004) for a \ncritique of this concept) and where ever possible information about consenting to \nparticipate in the research was provided in a form tailored to the individual\u2019s level of \nunderstanding. The site that is the focus of this paper, \u201cAshgrove\u201d, was, however, \nhome to adults who could not give informed consent to participate in the research. \nPrecisely because, owing to their inability to give informed consent, such individuals \nare largely absent from research on Learning Disabilities the research team were keen \nto ensure that the residents of \u201cAshgrove\u2019 were not excluded from participation and \ndid not remain part of the invisible portion of the Learning Disabled population. For \nthese reasons and in accordance with the principle that no-one could give consent on \ntheir behalf, all interested parties (parents, relatives or legal guardians) were informed \nof the intention to involve the residents of \u201cAshgrove\u201d in the research on the basis of \nassent. At this stage the parents of one male resident objected to his participation in \nthe research and consequently he was never video- or audio-recorded. For the \nremaining residents meetings involving the researcher, individual key workers, the \nhome manager and any other interested parties were held to determine whether \nparticipation in the research could in any way be contrary to the best interests of the \nresident. In all cases it was agreed that participation would not be contrary to their \nbest interests and, in fact, might be directly beneficial to them by promoting \nimprovement to the quality of support they received. From that point on all but the \none e\n6 \n \ninteractions with staff and other residents were amenable to video-recording.  The \nissue of assenting to participation in the research did not, however, end there. On all \noccasions when recording was to take place the residents\u2019 reactions to the presence of \nthe researcher and the camcorder were monitored by both the researcher and members \nof staff for any signs of distress; none were ever observed. In every other respect, the \nresearch conformed to usual ethical guidelines; recording did not take place in any \nsituation that could be considered an invasion of privacy and the confidentiality and \nanonymity of the participants\u2019 contributions are respected and assured.  \n \n \nMethod \nIf we are to study the details of how staff and residents interact, we shall need a \nmethod that that pays very close attention to the details of interaction as they appear \nin video recordings. Conversation Analysis, the method we report here, is a well-\nestablished approach to the study of talk in interaction. For an early account of the \nhistory of Conversation Analysis (henceforth, CA), see Heritage (1984); for an \noverview of its methods and style, see Hutchby and Wooffitt (1998) and ten Have  \n(1999); for the difference between CA and discourse analysis more generally, see \nWooffitt (2005). CA inspects recorded data to see how the participants in a scene \ndisplay their own understandings of what they are doing and saying, as evidenced in \nthe detailed organisation of their talk and, increasingly, their gaze and bodily \ndeportment (Goodwin, 1981).  \n \nWithin the field of research on intellectual disability, CA has already been used to \nstudy, among other questions,  the communicative strategies of people with an \nintellectual disability (e.g. Wootton, 1989); the practices of their assessment (e.g. \nAntaki, 1999); the interactional production of their alleged  \u2018acquiescence\u2019 and \n\u2018incompetence\u2019 (Rapley, 2004); the manner in which they manage their identities in \ninterviews (e.g. Rapley, Kiernan and Antaki, 1998); and the talk among supporters in \nmeetings (eg Wareing & Newell, 2002, 2004). However, most work has been done on \naudio-records, and the application of CA techniques to video-records in intellectual \ndisability research is only just beginning to emerge (see [Authors]; Williams, 2006). \nThe use of video-\n7 \n \ndisorder (for example, in aphasia: Goodwin, 1995, 2000;  autism: Dickerson et al, \n2005; deafness: Mahon, 2003; dysarthria: Bloch and Wilkinson, 2004) suggests that \nCA will be especially helpful in the study of visual records of interactions involving \npeople with severe intellectual impairments, whose spoken language is very limited.  \n \nAims of the analysis \nIn this article we shall use the insights of Conversation Analysis, alongside our \nethnographic records, to examine video-records of a verbal and a non-verbal \"game\". \nWe shall present two cases in which a staff member struggles with the dilemmas of \nempowerment and inclusion, in deciding how far to persist in her exchanges with a \nresident. In the first case (coded A-VD18, which we refer to as the \"tissue game\", \nbelow) an object initially held by the staff member is pressed casually into use as a \nplaything; in the other, A-VD42, a question and answer sequence based on a TV \nprogramme is used (which we have referred to as the Deal\/No Deal game).  In both \ncases, the development of the episode depends very heavily on the staff-member's \nactive construction of the situation, in spite of what may be seen as initial indifference \nor even resistance from the resident. \n \nWe should note at the outset that what the reader will see is a qualitative study of \nroutine events, in their interactional detail. Our aim is to show how small details of \ninteractional practice on the part of staff members can unwittingly produce and \nsustain certain identities for people with learning disabilities (for further examples of \nsuch case studies, although without the benefit of video records, see the outstanding \nresearch on identities in interaction of Goode, 1994, and Rapley, 2004). Case studies \nreveal and explicate (for a general defence of case studies in Conversation Analysis, \nsee Hutchby and Wooffitt 1998, ch 5), but they are not surveys or causal accounts. \nThe cases come from one residential home. and we cannot say how often cases like \nthis happen elsewhere, nor speculate on the motives of those involved here beyond \nwhat is manifest in their behaviour as captured on the video. The video record is, of \ncourse, not wholly unambiguous, but it allows the inspection of the kind of evidence \nwhich is not available to those who rely on contemporary notes.  A case study such as \nthis promises to bring to light the organisational details of the phenomenon at hand \nand, in CA terms, reveal the interactional contingencies that the parties impose on \n8 \n \neach other. Here, of course, we shall see that  the imposition is largely one-way, staff \nto resident. That the episodes excite no trouble - no one in the immediate environment \nseems surprised, or put out, by what happens \u2013 suggests that what we see is within the \nrange of normal practice.  \n \nAt this point it is useful to record that Matthew is a 36-year-old man. According to his \nfamily, he has a vocabulary of about 20 words. However, this would appear to include \nwords Mathew repeats after someone else has spoken them. Very few of these are \nevident on a day-to-day basis in the group home, and are often used only in response \nto prompts from staff or in routinized, specially-structured interactions. The most \nfrequent utterance he uses is the word \u2018mummy\u2019. Staff respond to this in a variety of \nways, including asking him to clarify, telling him they are not his mummy, informing \nhim when is mother will next visit, or simply acknowledging he has spoken. \nOccasionally this will elicit a further \u2018mummy\u2019 from Mathew, but more often he will \nmake no further verbal response, which makes it difficult for the staff to ascertain \nwhat the function of this utterance is in any particular case, other than to engage the \nstaff, albeit briefly, in interaction. He also makes use of expressive sounds and \ngestures to communicate affective responses, such as enjoyment or distress. \n \nCase 1: A non-verbal game (the \"tissue-game\") \nMatthew and Sandy are in the TV corner of the lounge. Matthew is sitting low on the \nground, on a bean bag, in front of the television set, on which is playing a videotape \nof a cartoon that he is understood to enjoy.  His back is to the camera (held by one of \nthe authors, CW). Sandy, a staff member, is sitting on a chair of normal height to his \nright, about arm's length away, looking down at him and side-on to the camera (the \nimage in Figure 1 will help illustrate the scene). She has no other duties at the \nmoment. She clasps a balled-up paper tissue between her hands. Matthew may be \nattending to the TV, but also occasionally turns his head to scan to his right and \nbehind him. At the beginning of the video, Sandy is leaning over, looking at him and \ntalking. The recording picks up the last syllable of something she has been saying to \nhim, followed by the question \u2018Why?\u2019 to which he does not reply. She looks at him \nfor several seconds before sitting up and looking around the room.  \n \n9 \n \n[Figure1  about here] \n \nThere then follows a long period of silence. At one point, when Matthew has turned \nhis head to his right and is looking in Sandy's direction, Sandy twice throws the balled \ntissue up in the air in front of her, catching it each time. When it descends for the \nsecond time, she lobs it gently to Matthew. At the same time, he says \u2018mummy\u2019. \nUnable to catch such fast-moving objects, it falls onto his bean bag. He bends forward \nand while he is reaching to pick it up Sandy says pick it up. He deposits it to his right \nand slightly behind him, more or less at Sandy's feet (just in the bottom right corner of \nthe image in Figure 1). She picks it up from the floor and throws it back to him. \n \nFor the next two minutes or so this pattern continues. In all, Sandy  throws the tissue \nat, or to, Matthew fourteen times, and each time he tosses it on the floor to his right, \nabout a foot away from her shoe. At two points there is a variation: she offers him the \ntissue to take in his hand, but on both occasions he shies away. In both cases she \nresumes her practice of tossing it towards him. \n \nAfter the penultimate exchange of throws, Matthew for the first time looks up directly \ntowards Sandy\u2019s face and tilts his head slightly. It is hard to see from the tape whether \nhe is smiling, but she smiles and laughs softly at this point, and also tilts her head \nwhile returning his gaze. She picks up the tissue and tosses it on him. He picks it up, \nthrows it on the floor, but this time she does not pick it up. They both watch the TV, \nand after a few seconds another member of staff comes in to the lounge and asks \ngenerally who wants coffee? The camera leaves Matthew and Sandy's corner to pan \naround the room to capture the various responses.  \n \nAnalysis. \nThis episode is spontaneous, uses a simple object to hand, and is conducted almost \nwholly non-verbally. At a gross level it is an attempt at solving a perennial problem \nfacing both Matthew and Sandy: how should they interact with each other? Sandy has \ntried to interact verbally with Matthew (asking him \u2018Why?\u2019) but he has not responded. \nLater, during Sandy\u2019s first throw, he has said \u2018mummy\u2019, and she has not responded \nverbally. For this house, structuring interactions so that both actors can participate is a \n10 \n \npervasive social problem for both staff and residents. We often observed staff \nmembers posing questions to, and directing comments at, residents to which the \nresidents did not seem able to respond, and, in turn, staff not responding to utterances \nor non-verbal movements on the part of residents. Sandy then initiates a different type \nof interaction, in which Matthew might be more able participate. If it is pleasurable \nfor him, it is a welcome example of good practice. But is it in fact pleasurable?  \n \nThe staff member's throwing of the tissue would be understandable by Matthew, as a \ncompetent member of the same culture, as being 'playful'. That is, as a non-\ninstrumental action, enjoyable in its own right, and inviting a prompt co-operative \nreciprocal response (most obviously, that Matthew throw the tissue back in such a \nway as to allow a repeat). Yet he might also regard it as a nuisance. \n \nThe question for Sandy (and the watching observer) is what to make of Matthew's \ninitial and subsequent responses. Without the codification that spoken language \nallows, and without a full range of conventional signs and gestures, his non-verbal \nactions are amenable to multiple interpretations. Sandy must ask herself: what attitude \ncan she infer from Matthew's behaviour? If it is a negative one, she then has a \ndilemma: is she nevertheless to persist in the game, and cajole him into enjoying it, or \nstop now, to respect his immediate wishes? \n \nThe dilemma of immediate abandonment versus sustained insistence is a common one \nfor staff in their dealings with people with an intellectual disability. In the following \nanalysis, we shall look carefully to see what evidence is available to Sandy in making \nher decision to press on with the game, and how she designs her actions in view of the \nrisks and benefits of the dilemma she confronts. \n \nInterpreting Matthew's initial response. \nMathew\u2019s prompt response to Sandy\u2019s first throw does not come unambiguously. He \ncould throw the tissue back at Sandy (it would be within his physical powers), but he \ndoes not; nor does he look directly up at Sandy in acknowledgement, nor indeed does \nhis face change expression. He does pick the tissue up but simply deposits it on the \nfloor (figure 2). But his choice of location is ambiguous. He does not drop it in \n11 \n \nSandy's home position for collecting (directly in her mid-line, between her feet), but \nneither is it so far away that she cannot reach it. What is Sandy to make of this? \n \n[Figure 2 about here] \n \nSandy can eliminate several possibilities. Matthew has not entered into the activity as \na fully-reciprocal game of physically-equal turns (each throwing, to the best of their \nability, the tissue directly towards the other's grasp). But he is not obviously and \nactively resisting the game (for example, by throwing the tissue away out of her reach \nor keeping it clutched in his hand). Equally, he is not showing passive resistance by \nignoring the presence of tissue and turning back to the TV. This leaves two further \nand contrasting possibilities. One is that his actions are consistent with a less exactly \nequal game, one in which she throws, and he pretends not to respond, but nevertheless \nkeeps the game moving by actively placing the tissue where she can collect it and \nrepeat the throw. The other possibility is that he is actively resisting the enterprise, \nand getting rid of the offending object as best he can, or at least performing under \nduress. Which will she choose? \n \nPretending not to like something \nIn choosing to pursue the game, Sandy is embodying a practice that is pervasive in \nthis, as in other residences we have studied: to treat the resident's ambiguous \nparticipation or non-compliance as initial reluctance, or temporary failure to \nunderstand . We have seen this in getting residents: to come to dinner; to go to the \ntoilet; to move to another room; and so on (e.g. authors\u2019 ref). In each case the staff \ntreat resistance (sometimes what seems, on the video record, to be utterly \nunambiguous resistance) as something to be overcome, by firm but friendly (or not so \nfriendly) means. They find, or impose, a more positive interpretation on the residents' \nbehaviour. \n \nIn the case of the tissue game, Sandy is not imposing an interpretation on Matthew \nwithout basis. The common culture provides 'teasing' as a ready template for her \naction and a positive spin on Matthew's initial response. If her throwing of a tissue \nwas a distracting 'tease' away from the television (which did not seem to engage him \n12 \n \nanyway) then his response is fully understandable and indeed would have been \npredictable. As Drew (1987) describes it, the teased person, if he or she is not to \nmerely shut down the interaction, will give a 'po-faced response' to the tease; this \nshows that he or she does not agree with the content of the tease, but is nevertheless \nwilling to allow the teaser to press on with a further round. Here is an example: \n \nExtract XX from Schegloff (1988, pp 119 and 125, lines renumbered). Carol has just \ncome into the room. \n1             [door squeaks] \n2   Sherri:   Hi Carol. = \n3   Carol:    = [Hi:: \n4   Ruthie:     [CA:ROl, HI:: \n5\u2192 Sherri:   You didn' get an ice-cream sanwich, \n6   Carol:    I kno:w, hh I decided that my body didn't  \n7             need it, \n8   Sherri:   Yes but ours di:d \n \nSherri teasingly 'notices' that Carol hasn't brought ice-cream. Carol does not \napologise, but responds as if seriously, with a cod 'account' for why not (her body \ndidn't need it). This allows Sherri to see that Carol is ready to play the game again: \nbut ours did, she counters.  The analogy with Matthew and Sandy is that Sandy's first \nthrow is the initial tease; Matthew doesn't respond 'seriously' by throwing it back in a \nperfect reciprocal gesture, but neither does he simply turn away or toss the tissue out \nof her reach: he does something which allows Sandy to read him as responding, like \nCarol, 'po-faced' to the tease. That permits Sandy, like Sherri, to press on for another \nround. \n \nFrom pretence of indifference to a display of authentic enjoyment \nNow that the  'game' is launched, it continues in this vein for thirteen more exchanges. \nThere is no need to chart every one, but we want to make one further analytic point: \nthat Sandy shows a concern for upgrading Matthew's response to an unambiguously \npositive one. Although the po-faced response to the tease was sufficient to get the \ngame off the ground, it would be more easily kept up in the air if Matthew now \nshowed signs of 'serious' enjoyment.  \n \nIn the absence of Matthew showing such signs spontaneously, Sandy must elicit them. \nAgain she can draw on a common institutional practice in this residential home (and \n13 \n \nothers): ask a question (or, in this case, provide an action) which presumes a response \neven more positive than the one currently on the table. \n \nWhat we mean is that she does the physical equivalent of asking Matthew would you \nlike to have a go? To ask such a question would be to assume that his actions are not \nmerely consistent with a passive-pretend version of the game, but can be upgraded to \nan active, fully reciprocal one. She does not do so verbally, but by putting the tissue \nright up against Matthew's chest, looking directly at him, and holding it there for him \nto grasp (then, presumably, throw back). \n \n[Figure 3 about here] \n \nAs we noted in the gloss with which we began consideration of this episode, Matthew \non the first occasion shies away from the proffered tissue; when Sandy tries again, \nafter six further rounds of the game, he again turns away, this time also dropping his \nhands away from any chance of contact with the tissue. In other words, Sandy's \nattempts to get Matthew to upgrade his participation to that of an active player of the \ngame are twice conspicuously rejected. Yet she continues. Clearly, the practice of \ntreating Mathew as \"not really unwilling\" is very robust. Before the final round of \nthrows, Matthew looks directly up into Sandy\u2019s face, and this, if anything, might be \ntaken as a sign of his positive orientation to the interaction. Indeed, Sandy engages his \ngaze, smiles and laughs. \n \nSummary of the \"tissue-game\" analysis \nThere is more detail to be mined from the three minutes of interaction in the game, \nbut we leave it at this juncture. We have extracted our main point: that a game poses a \nstaff member with a dilemma if the resident does not immediately and unambiguously \ndisplay approval of what is happening; and that the dilemma is routinely solved by \ntreating approval as merely deferred. We identified two practices by which the staff \nmember prosecutes the solution in this non-verbal case: by treating the resident's \nambiguous initial response as the response to a 'tease', permitting a further round; and, \nhaving used that practice to establish the game, trying to upgrade the resident's \nparticipation status by soliciting a more unambiguously positive engagement. That her \n14 \n \npersistence with the game is proof against rebuff at two such points is testament to the \npower of the institutional practice it embodies. \n \nCase 2: A verbal game: \"Deal or No Deal\"  \nThe next scene was recorded several weeks after the tissue game. Again it involves \nSandy and Matthew. This time the game is based on words. The background is that \nMatthew regularly watches a game-show on TV called \u2018Deal or No Deal\u2019. At various \npoints in the show contestants are offered differing amounts of money, which they \nmust decide to accept (Deal) or reject (No Deal). If they reject the offer, they continue \nwith the game in the hope of winning even more money. \u2018Deal or No Deal?\u2019 is a \nphrase repeated by the presenter throughout the show.  \n \nOver recent weeks Sandy and Matthew have developed a game whereby Sandy acts \nthe part of the presenter. It is purely ludic: there is no prize at stake. Usually Sandy \nwill start by saying \u2018Deal?\u2019 or \u2018Deal or no deal?\u2019, and Matthew will make an utterance \n(eg \u2018de dee\u2019) that Sandy takes to be the reciprocal response. He often smiles and claps \nduring the activity. Occasionally, as further evidence that the activity is enjoyable to \nhim, it is Matthew who initiates the routine (with what Sandy has come to treat as the \n\u2018no deal\u2019 expression in the catechism). Given Matthew\u2019s limited verbal engagement \nwith people, his part in the game is treated as an institutional cause for celebration (as \nwell as laughing and clapping, Sandy may call other staff to listen). However, the \ninitiation of such a game can be a site of ambiguity which poses Sandy with the \nfamiliar dilemma of whether to pursue, or abandon, the activity. \n \nAnalysis \nWe pick up the scene in the lounge. The camera is on Matthew, who is sitting alone \nagainst the wall. To his left, off-screen, is Sandy. To his right is the TV, which he is \nwatching. It is broadcasting the news, which remains audible in the background. A \nclose inspection of how the 'game' starts is helpful. \n \nExtract A-VD42 \u2013 1.39-2.02 (for transcription conventions, see Appendix) \n01     S    Matthew, (3.0) [>a'you   gunnu   watch  it < ]  [today, \n02     M                 [lowers then brings hands up ]  [claps \n03     M      (leaning back, clapping, looking at TV) \n15 \n \n04     S       yea:::::::h,  \u00b0hh\u00b0 ((smiley voice)) \n05     M      (flexing fingers \u2013 hands together) \n06     S       [YEa:::h (.) we gonna watch it today aren\u2019t we.           ] \n07     M      [looks left towards Sandy, flexing fingers \u2013 thumbs together ] \n08     M   (looks right to TV)  \n09  \u2192 S    NO:: [de::::al,                  ] \n10     M          [closes hands, looking at TV  ]  \n11     M   [(gently squeezing hands together, looking at TV)] \n12           [             (9.0 seconds)                  ] \n13     M     (lowers then raises hands, turns head away from TV so it is  \n14            midway between Sandy and TV, looks down at hands, then  \n15          closes eyes) \n \nThere is a powerful institutional imperative at work here: upgrade passive sitting to  \nactive interaction. In pursuit of this imperative, Sandy incrementally elevates the \npassive episode into a full-scale active game. At first Sandy begins by asking him if \nMatthew (and just he) is going to watch 'it' today (we assume \u2018it\u2019 means the game \nshow). Without looking away from the TV, he begins to clap, which she responds to \nwith a prolonged \u2018yeaaahhh\u2019 in a \u2018smiley\u2019 intonation (line 4). As her word tails off he \nturns from the TV to look at her. Now she reissues her initial positive assessment, but \nupgrades it into a call to joint action: yeah, we\u2019re gonna watch it today aren\u2019t we. He \nturns his head back to the TV. At this point (line 9) she proposes a still further \nupgrade, to actively playing the game that is associated with it, right now: she issues \nthe formula no deal. Matthew stops moving his hands together, and continues to look \nat the TV for 9 seconds. Then he looks down at his hands, and shuts his eyes. \n \nAt this point, Sandy has a choice. Should she now abandon the game, accepting that \nMatthew has made a decision not to take part? It is exactly in these micro-moments \nthat policy goals of choice and control are embodied, and it is here the discretion of \nworkers in implementing policy can be seen (Lipsky, 1980). To persist in the face of \nhis clear non-uptake might, in this light, be seen as pestering or bullying him, as \ninterfering with his life (and watching the TV is not an inconsiderable part of \nMatthew's life in this residential home).  \n \nSandy has little to go on here. Matthew has made no overt response. But there is one \nfeature of his behaviour that she can grasp at: he has turned his head so that while it \nwas at 180 degrees to her when he was watching TV, it is now at 90 degrees, mid-way \n16 \n \nbetween the TV and her. Sandy might take this as an indication that, while not fully \nengaging in her proposal to upgrade the interaction into a game, Matthew is at least \nnot committing himself to the rival attraction of the TV. In this sense it is like his \nresponse to the tissue game \u2013 although he has not responded in a way that would \nindicate full engagement, he has nevertheless made what might be taken as a partial \nresponse. In this case, she treats him as disengaging from the TV, and allowing her a \nfurther turn in the pre-game.  \n \nInstruction rather than invitation \nNow, though, she attempts to dispel all ambiguity by upgrading her invitation to its \nmaximum: she issues an explicit, bald instruction - say deal (line 15 below). This \nillustrates the premium that Sandy puts on the getting Matthew to \"speak his lines\".  \n \nExtract XX A-VD42 \u2013 2.01-2.22 (continues immediately from extract above) \n15    S:    say dEA:l. \n16    M:   (continues looking down; opens and closes LH, looks   \n17        to TV, raises hands to partially cover face on S's side)    (8.0) \n18    M :  (scratches temple, [(lowers LH onto RH)              \n19 \u2192 M:                    [(dee dee)                        \n20    S:    no:: [dea:::l.    ]                                   \n21     M:          [(claps)] (claps twice)                           \n \nEight seconds pass in which Mathew does not respond to Sandy's directive. He does \nnot look at her nor speak, but looks back towards the TV, hands apparently shielding \nhis view of Sandy (line 18). In ordinary conversation this turning away, shielding his \nface, and long silence would be a highly marked rejection of an instruction. But then, \nwhile still looking at the TV, he says (what we transcribe as) dee dee (line 19). \n \n\"Dee dee\" is the sound which he has used in previous 'deal \/ no deal' games. It seems, \nthen, that he is complying, even after this very long delay. He drops his hands and \nturns to face forward, midway again between Sandy and the TV. Sandy immediately \nresponds \u2018no deal\u2019. There are two further exchanges (which we will not reproduce for \nreasons of space) which seem unambiguously positive. Matthew claps and says \u2018de \ndee\u2019, and when Sandy repeats \u2018no deal\u2019 again he turns to look at her, smiling. Again \nhe says \u2018ne dee\u2019, claps, then turns to smile at the camera or at CW who is operating it. \nSandy again says \u2018no deal\u2019 and claps herself. Matthew looks at her, smiling broadly, \n17 \n \nand she repeats the phrase again while clapping. This part of the exchange shows the \ngame at its most successful phase \u2013 they are responding verbally to each other and \nindicating mutual enjoyment with laughter, clapping and smiles. \n \nReturn to ambiguity \nHowever, after this flurry of comparatively prompt reciprocation Matthew shuts his \neyes. He puts a finger in each eye socket. Although he is smiling, his orientation is \nagain ambiguous. Sandy might take his behaviour as a sign he wishes to stop. Again, \nshe has a choice. And again she persists, and in a laughing voice offers \u2018no deal\u2019. He \ntakes his fingers from his eyes, but keeps his face covered and she offers, in a louder \nvoice: \u2018deal or no deal\u2019. In the same position, he says \u2018ne dee\u2019 (line 49), and the game \nis back on course. Indeed, it is maintained for another three minutes. But Matthew's \nresponses grow less prompt and confident. At one point Sandy recruits another \nmember of staff, Nahib, to join in the game. Matthew responds verbally to somewhat \nless than half of Sandy\u2019s \u2018deal \/ no deal\u2019 utterances, and eventually the game peters \nout. \n \nSummary of the \u2018deal\/no deal\u2019 game \nThe verbal deal \/ no deal episode is further illustration, and development, of the two \nthemes established in the analysis of the non-verbal tissue game: the pursuit of an \ninstitutional imperative to action, and the solution of an institutional dilemma. \n \nFirst, the game is made to be an institutional success. Sandy has cajoled or \nencouraged Matthew into a reciprocating verbal game, despite Matthew having \nseverely limited verbal communication. Both parties smile\/laugh, clap and persist, \nclearly responding to each other. In this latter sense the scene is even better than the \ntissue game which, although it provided a context in which they could both perform \ncompetently, visible signs of enjoyment were not so noticeable.  \n \nSecond, Sandy has again solved the institutional dilemma of responding to Mathew\u2019s \nambiguous participation at the beginning of the game and at various other points in \njust the way she did in the tissue game: by persevering. At various points, Matthew\u2019s \nbehaviour might be taken as indicating that he does not want to participate in the \n18 \n \ngame (preferring to watch the TV), or that he wants to stop the game. He covers his \nface, sticks his fingers in his eyes, turns away to watch the TV, and most importantly, \ndeclines to reply. These might be taken as even clearer signs of resistance than \noccurred in the tissue game. However, there are other ways of reading these signs, and \nother indications that contradict this reading, and it is these that Sandy appears to \norient to. For example, although Mathew only says \u2018de dee\u2019 intermittently, when he \ndoes he often smiles and claps. Since it seems hard to predict on which occasion he \nwill respond, Sandy\u2019s choice is either to persist, knowing that many of her turns will \nproduce no response, or to stop. The latter would perhaps avoid the danger of \nignoring his preference (although we can not be sure what his preference is in this \ncase), but would close down the opportunity to produce a truly mutual exchange \nwhich Mathew appears to (intermittently) enjoy.  \n \nCoda: producing incompetence \nIn interactions between residents and staff in Ashgrove, there is always the danger \nthat one party will produce a turn, whether verbal or non-verbal, to which the other \ndoes not or can not respond. If the deal\/no deal game is to develop, either Mathew or \nSandy must introduce new elements which the other must take up in some way. If this \nis not done, the game becomes repetitive, limited to the simple format we have seen. \nHowever, the danger is that the interaction changes from one in which both are \nperforming competently, to one in which incompetence is produced.  \n \nAfter the stretch above, Sandy begins to introduce new elements into the game. \nMatthew puts his hands over his face and does not respond. She asks \u2018are you \nthinking Matthew?\u2019, and then \u2018Are you ready for the question Matthew?\u2019 She repeats \nboth questions several times, but he does not respond. Then she offers \u2018deal or no \ndeal\u2019 again, and this time he does respond \u2018no deal\u2019. She then begins to add monetary \nvalues (e.g. \u201c10,000, deal or no deal\"). This leads to new questions which appear to \nexclude him still more irredeemably from participation, such as \u2018are you sure?\u2019; \u2018is \n30,000 small?\u2019; what about 50,000?\u2019 When he does not respond, she asks \u2018are you \nthinking?\u2019 She then tries to bring the other staff, Nahib, into the game, and directs \nMatthew to \u2018ask Nahib, deal or no deal\u2019, to which, again, he does not reply. Then she \n19 \n \ncontinues to ask him questions about the size of monetary values (e.g. \u2018is 50,000 \nsmall?), and to offer him numbers (\u201950? 100?').  \n \nIt is at best unclear how Matthew is supposed to participate. These questions are well \noutside the type of language that he is used to responding to, or using himself. The \ngame has changed from one in which he was a competent actor to one in which he has \nbecome incompetent. Indeed, the relevant audience for Sandy\u2019s questions at this point \nmight not be Matthew at all, but Chris, behind the camera, and the other staff \nmember, Nahib; one way of looking at this is that Mathew has become the butt of a \njoke. However, again it is not so simple. While Sandy\u2019s behaviour is producing \nMathew as an incompetent actor, it is also potentially attributing him, respectfully or \nin jest, with knowledge of numbers, or at least the form of the game show. It is not \nimpossible that he might have made a response at some point in this later exchange: \nhe might have produced the phrase \u2018deal or no deal\u2019 (or something like it, rather than \nhis usual \u2018de dee\u2019), directed at Nahib; he might have alternated \u2018dee\u2019 and \u2018de dee\u2019 to \ndifferent monetary values; he might even have repeated a number. And any of these \ncould have become the basis for a new version of the game. On this occasion he does \nnot, and so the game ends, for us as analysts, looking less positive \u2013 Mathew has \nbecome excluded and incompetent. \n \nThere is an important caveat here. Perhaps naturally, it is easier for us to comment on \nSandy\u2019s verbal behaviour, and to recognize when she is adding new elements to the \ngame. We are less sensitive to noticing new things Mathew might have been doing, \nwhich were not picked up by Sandy. To give just two examples, he positioned his \nhands in various ways during the tissue game that might have been used by Sandy to \nvary her throws, and his covering of his face in the deal or no deal game might have \nbeen imitated by Sandy for her own speech. These are the types of behaviours that \nthose practicing \u2018intensive interaction\u2019 might have noticed and responded to. \nHowever, we notice Sandy\u2019s behaviour because is seems more forceful, because she \nuses direction and it is verbal. But we must not forget that, in a quieter way, Mathew\u2019s \nbehaviour might also be the spur for the development of the game, and therefore \nmuch of what he does might not be picked up by Sandy.  \n \n20 \n \nConcluding comments: The interactional gains and risks of 'games' \nWe set out in this article to examine staff members' initiation and pursuit of 'games' \nwith residents. We picked a verbal and a non-verbal game, and looked carefully at the \nvisual record, backed up by ethnographic notes. The comments we make here do not, \nwe think, apply only to this particular pair of resident and staff member: the practices \nthat the latter used, and the ambiguous behaviour shown by the former, are, in our \nview, emblematic of the life of the residential home in general. It is incidents like \nthese which make up the social life of the house.  \n \nWhat we hope to have shown is that the staff have available a series of mundane \nconversational moves at their command, which they can deploy to either abandon a \ngame or sustain it. In sustaining it (by treating the resident's ambiguous response as in \nfact a willing pretence, as in the tissue game, or by escalating the invitations until they \nbecome an instruction, in the deal \/ no deal game), the staff member puts into visible \npractice the institutional imperative to encourage social interaction and make \nwitnessable signs of enjoyment by the residents - at the expense of the potential \ndanger of disrespecting their choice to remain passive. In this sense, what we see in \nthis \u2018social\u2019 interaction is similar to what we see when staff encourage residents to \ncome to eat, come to the toilet, step on the weighing scales, and so on (author ref). \nHowever, it is in such moments, which are purely ephemeral, that abstract policies of \nempowerment and social inclusion are made live (see Lipsky, 1980, for the general \npoint of how policy is \u2018made\u2019 by front-line workers). Although each episode is brief - \nlasting two or three minutes - each is in its own way a microcosm of the world in \nwhich the resident lives, and which the staff member plays a powerfully large part in \nshaping. \n \nIn games such as these, we can see that goals of social inclusion, in the sense of \npromoting non-instrumental \u2018social\u2019 interactions in which both actors can play a part, \ncan potentially rub up against goals of empowerment and promoting independence. In \nboth games, Sandy could be more sensitive to Mathew\u2019s mode of responding \u2013 they \nare very much on her terms, in that she persists when he does not respond, issues \ndirectives, and delivers the first turn to which Mathew is to respond. In the coda to the \ndeal\/no deal game, Sandy\u2019s behaviour turns the interaction from one in which he is \n21 \n \ncompetent into one in which he looks, to us, incompetent. This section of the \ninteraction illustrates par excellence one the central tenets of social models of \ndisability \u2013 that disability can be produced by the way in which the context is \nstructured (for discussions of other ways in which the social model of disability might \napply to people with severe and profound learning disabilities see Coles, 2001; \nFerguson, 1987; Goodley, 2001). However we must also note that in Ashgrove, a \nservice in which verbal language is often the first recourse of the staff, rarely did we \nsee non-instrumental interactions involving Mathew that were so prolonged, that \ncontained so many successful turns and, in the case of the deal no deal game, that was \naccompanied by such apparent signs of enjoyment. Still, the games would be yet more \nempowering, and would allow him more opportunities for competence if they were \nmore fully on his terms. The work of David Goode (1994) and the techniques of \nIntensive Interaction (Nind & Hewitt, 2001) provide examples of how one might \nengage more fully and sensitively with Mathew\u2019s ways of being in the world. \n \nOne of the problems we often encounter when trying to understand empowerment in \npractice is in trying to decide when encouragement becomes direction, and when \nplayfulness tips over into disempowerment. For the actors, as for us, this is not an \neasy question. In the examples described here, we come up with a different reading of \nwhat is going on if we take seriously the idea that Mathew might be exercising just as \nmuch direction as Sandy. For example, his throwing of the tissue onto the ground \nrather than onto Sandy\u2019s lap might be read as a tease on his part, forcing her \ncontinually to bend down to retrieve the tissue from the floor. His \u2018de dee\u2019 utterances, \nwhich we have read as responses to Sandy\u2019s utterances, might also be glossed quite \ndifferently. Given the long silence before he says it, we might read this as his having \ndeclined to take up second position, and instead as his initiation of a new round. \nSandy\u2019s rapid response to his utterance would certainly be consistent with this \nreading, and in other examples of this game we do in fact see Mathew start up the \ngame by offering \u2018de dee\u2019. But we do not naturally read it this way; because he speaks \nless often than her, and because of Sandy\u2019s institutional position, we are inclined to \nsee her as proactive, him as reactive. \n \n22 \n \nWe end, then, on this note. The 'game' format is a site for institutional success. But it \nis also dangerous territory. With its provision for multiple turns at talk, for \ncompetition, for skilled jousting, and for persistence beyond what might seem \nreasonable, the 'game' provides an instance of how principles of social inclusion and \nexclusion, empowerment and disempowerment, and competence and incompetence \nplay out, often ambiguously, in the everyday lives of people with profound learning \ndisabilities.   \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe research for this article was funded by ESRC grant number RES-148-25-0002. \nThanks to the NHS trust in which the research took place, and the staff and residents \ninvolved \n \nReferences \nAntaki, C.
