We draw on two studies to \ninform a discussion of the kinds of research and research infrastructure \nneeded to support high quality social care services for children. The first study \nidentified the questions to which practitioners in social care wanted answers; \nthe second describes the degree of \u2018fit\u2019 between funded research and \npractitioners\u2019 questions. We conclude with a commentary on what some of the \nsolutions might be to the problems we identify, and the kinds of research \ninfrastructure that might be needed to move towards these solutions.    \n \n \nBackground \n \nThe question of how research gets into policy and practice is a longstanding \none in applied areas (Alderson et al. 1996; Bero et al. 1998; Crosland et al. \n1998; Richardson, Jackson & Sykes 1990;Sheldon 1998); although it tends to \nbe a concern more consistently raised by researchers than by practitioners. \nOne clear barrier to getting research into practice, identified in a number of \nstudies (e.g. Barnardo's Research and Development 2000; Fitzgerald, Ferlie \n& Hawkins 2003) has been the tendency of researchers to adopt a \u2018push\u2019 \nmodel of knowledge transfer in which research reports thud onto desks (or \n 3 \nappear in inboxes), rather than a \u2018pull\u2019 model in which practitioners, planners \nand policy makers pull down research on the topics they need, when they \nneed it. Some steps have been taken to address this, most notably perhaps in \nthe funding now made available for 'intermediary' organisations like Research \nin Practice, who perform a variety of roles to bridge this gap. In addition, the \nESRC investment in What Works for Children \n(http:\/\/www.whatworksforchildren.org.uk\/) enabled a group of researchers \nfrom City University and the University of York to work with R&D and policy \ncolleagues in the children\u2019s charity Barnardo\u2019s on a suite of knowledge \nexchange topics, including the  production and dissemination of Evidence \nNuggets ; signposting  relevant research, websites and databases; generating \nand helping practitioners to formulate research questions; logging \npractitioners\u2019 questions; providing evidence-based answers to practitioners' \nquestions and providing training seminars on relevant subjects. \n \nIn the UK and elsewhere, a number of factors are moving research further up \nthe \u2018to do\u2019 lists of practitioners working in social care. These include the \nrequirements of many programme funders for research evidence to underpin \ninterventions, and a growing recognition of the rights of children to services \nbased on the best available evidence. Research on what might \u2018work\u2019 is in \nrelatively short supply in social care, where traditional strengths have been in \nqualitative research and in identifying need. Those who research, practice, \nplan or fund services in areas where there is at least as much potential to do \ngood (or harm) as in medicine need to consider what scope there is for \nimprovement. This is particularly the case since those who use social care \n 4 \nservices tend to be less well-positioned to seek (or demand) evidence about \nthe \u2018treatments\u2019 they receive than many of those who require healthcare \ninterventions. At the same time, service providers tend to be less well-\ninformed about the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of what they have to \noffer than their counterparts in health (Roberts, Shiell & Stevens 2008), while \nresearchers may have been less responsive to practitioners\u2019 questions, and \nless engaged in knowledge exchange than they might be. \n \nThe identification of problems of this kind is by no means new. In relation to \nthe setting up of the welfare state, Richard Titmuss was among those whose \nwork had influence, not only through his publications (Titmuss 1958; 1950; \n1943; 1938) but also through dialogue with policy makers (Alcock et al. 2008). \nIn 1991, Roy Parker and his colleagues wrote: \u2018It has \u2026 become increasingly \napparent that unless outcomes in childcare can be adequately measured, we \nhave no means of justifying the actions of social workers, which may have far-\nreaching and permanent consequences for individuals\u2019 (Parker 1991).  More \nrecently, while the development of the Sure Start programme was \nunderpinned by research on the importance of early childhood interventions, \n(Glass 1999; Roberts 2000), there is a question about the extent to which \nevidence about efficacy adequately underpinned the menu of interventions \neligible for public investment. Rutter (2006) has also pointed out that political \nconstraints on research placed limits on what the evaluation of the initial \nphase of Sure Start can usefully tell us.  \n \n 5 \nIn the discussion that follows, we draw on the findings of two studies - one \nthat identified questions to which practitioners in social care wanted answers \nand one that looked at the sort of research funded. We describe the degree of \n\u2018fit\u2019 between questions and answers, discuss what these findings might mean, \nwhat some of the solutions might be to the problems we identify, and the \nkinds of research and research infrastructure which might be needed to work \ntowards solutions.   \n \nThe UK context in which we are working is one where, over the last decade or \nso, there has been a growing interest in the place of research evidence in \nunderpinning services to children and families. UK policy emphasises the \ncentrality of outcomes. The Children Act 20041 and the accompanying \nguidance, Every Child Matters2 require children\u2019s services to be organized to \nimprove the well-being of all children living in their area. \n \nBias cannot be eliminated from academic research, but it can be reduced, and \npotential sources of bias made transparent. In any case, in a piece such as \nthis, where much of the content arises from reflections based on a wide range \nof evidence, it may help if our backgrounds are clear. Three sources of bias \nare institutional affiliation, intellectual or philosophical starting points and \nfinancial conflicts of interest. The last tends to be more relevant in health \nresearch where powerful industrial stakeholders may fund research and have \na natural interest in promoting (or otherwise) particular findings. In our case, \nas in most work in social science and social care, there is no such conflict of \n                                                 \n1 http:\/\/www.everychildmatters.gov.uk\/strategy\/guidance\/ \n2 http:\/\/www.everychildmatters.gov.uk\/ \n 6 \ninterest. The empirical work we described here was funded through a \nresearch council, the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC).  \n \nAll of the authors are social scientists by training and for large parts of our \ncareers. While conducting this study, and for most of the time we were \npreparing it for publication, MS, KL and HR were working in the Child Health \nResearch and Policy Unit, City University London. Our current affiliations are \non the title page. We three are career researchers, and to that extent, have an \ninterest in the usual conclusion that \u2018more research is needed\u2019. Two of us, KL \nand HR, spent between us 12 years in Barnardo\u2019s, a UK children\u2019s charity, HR \nas Head of R&D and KL as a member of the research team.   SW was one of \nthe researchers with lead responsibility for the initiation in the 1980s of the \nBritish Social Attitudes reports, and worked as a quantitative researcher for 15 \nyears.  She has been at the Nuffield Foundation overseeing its work in social \nresearch for more than a decade, and is currently Deputy Director there.  The \nFoundation aims to bring about improvements in society through research and \npractical experiment.  This article reflects her personal views, and not those of \nthe Foundation.   \n \nWe all have experience of the appropriate use of both quantitative and \nqualitative methodologies and a wide range of research designs including \ninterviews, surveys, longitudinal work of various sorts, intervention studies \nand systematic reviews. Most importantly, it would be fair to say that we all \ncame to social science and social research because we believed that it could \nhelp make a better world; we are all committed to the belief that children and \n 7 \nfamilies have a right to services that are more likely to do more good than \nharm, and are based on the best available evidence. \n \nWhat we did \nWe carried out a systematic review to identify studies which asked UK social \ncare practitioners what research they felt would help their practice. We \nsearched a range of databases3 and online journals, carried out citation \nsearches and made direct personal contacts to locate studies published \nbetween 1995 and 2004 (See Stevens, Liabo & Roberts 2007 for full details). \nWe then identified research on child and family social welfare funded by five \nmajor UK funders between 1996 and 2004, and compared the results to look \nat the ways in which funded research activity maps onto practitioners\u2019 \nexpressed needs. The funders were the Economic and Social Research \nCouncil (ESRC), the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the Nuffield Foundation, \nthe Gatsby Foundation4 and the Community Fund5 (now the Big Lottery \nFund). In order to obtain data on funded studies we searched funders\u2019 \nwebsites and annual reports. \n \nThe review of practitioners\u2019 research priorities found 1005 research \nsuggestions from five studies (see Table 1), while the mapping of funded \nstudies resulted in information on 625 studies (see Table 2).  \n \n                                                 \n3 Medline, PsychInfo, British Nursing Index, Cinahl, Embase (all via Ovid), CareData, \nChildData, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), Evidence Network \nbibliography, Regard, British Education Index, Education Resources Information Centre \n(ERIC) \n4 Economic and Social Research \n5 Research grants \n 8 \nTable 1: Sources of practitioners\u2019 responses \nResponse source Frequency Percent \nCEBSS (Sheldon 2000) 429 43 \nNCH (O\u2019Leary 2000) 238 24 \nNI Barnardo's (Hart 2004)    186 19 \nNCH (O\u2019Leary 2004) 78 8 \nWWfC (What works for children 2006) 74 8 \nTotal 1005 100 \n \nTable 2: Sources of funded studies \nFunder N % \nESRC 314 50 \nJoseph Rowntree Foundation 228 36.5 \nNuffield Foundation 35 6 \nCommunity Fund 28 4.5 \nGatsby Foundation 20 3 \nTotal 625 100 \n \nWe categorised each practitioner research suggestion, and the question \naddressed by each funded study, by both topic and question type. The \nquestion type categories were:  \n \n1. Employee issues where practitioners were the focus of the question \n2. Interventions:   \n2.1. Does it work \u2013 is this intervention effective? \n 9 \n2.2. What works \u2013 what is effective for this problem? \n2.3. What is there for this target group \u2013 what interventions are \navailable for people experiencing this problem ? \n2.4.

Policy \n5. Other \n6. Not clear \n \nResearch topics \nWe grouped practitioners\u2019 questions according to their main focus. For the ten \ntopics identified most frequently, we searched the database of funded studies \nto see whether the questions had been addressed. Table 3 shows that nearly \nevery question had been addressed by at least one study. However, most of \nthese questions represent problems for which even several studies would be \nunlikely to provide an answer - certainly not a complete answer.  \n 10 \nTable 3: Research areas most frequently raised by practitioners  \nQuestion asked more than 20 times N Subject \ncovered in \nfunded studies \nQuestion \nmatched in \nfunded studies \nChild protection \u2013 what works? 31 21 12 \nEffects on children living with \nsubstance-abusing parents \n27 3 3 \nEngaging with hard-to-reach \nfamilies\/individuals \n26 8 3 \nShould adopted children have contact \nwith their birth family \n25 2 1 \nPreventative family support work vs \ncrisis intervention \n24 0 0 \nMulti-agency working \u2013 what works? 23 5 3 \nFamily support services \u2013 do they \nwork? \n23 18 8 \nWorkloads and associated problems 23 06 0 \nBehaviour problems \u2013 what works? 21 6 1 \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6 The CareData database indicates a large literature on this topic in the UK, however, our \nsearch was designed to identify studies relevant to services to children and families. Most of \nthese questions came from practitioners working in local authority social services \ndepartments.  \n \n 11 \nQuestion type \nTable 4 shows the proportion of funded studies and practice questions coded \nto the different categories of question type. In summary, this shows that \npractitioners were more likely to ask a question about service effectiveness, \nand funded studies were more likely to look at the causes or the nature of \nsocial problems.  \n \nTable 4:Types of research question asked by funded studies and by \npractitioners \nType of question \n \nFunded \nstudies (n) \nPractitioners\u2019 \nquestions (n) \nEffectiveness of interventions or services \n(\u2018does it work\u2019 and \u2018what works\u2019 questions) \n 13% (82) 45% (456) \nWhat interventions are there?  2.4% (15) 4% (45) \nEffects of not intervening  0.2% (1) 1% (8) \nUsers\u2019 views  8.5% (53) 2% (22) \nCauses\/understanding problems  64% (402) 16% (165) \nPolicy  4.2% (26) 2% (16) \n Employment issues  3.7% (23) 19% (187) \nOther\/not clear  3.7% (23) 2% (23) \nTotal 100% (625) 100% (1005) \n \n \n \n \n 12 \nMethodological approach of the funded studies \n \nWe also gathered data on methodological approaches. When the funding \norganisation\u2019s records did not describe study methods, a Google search using \nsearch terms based on available data enabled us to ascertain the research \ndesigns of all but 9% (n=54) of the included studies. As Table 5 indicates, a \nqualitative design was the most common (37%,n=230) including focus groups, \nobservational methods, in-depth interviews and action research.  \n \nWe were particularly interested in the methodologies used in those studies \nthat made a claim to investigate effectiveness. Of the 82 studies that looked at \nthe effectiveness of interventions or services (led by a \u2018what works\u2019 or a \u2018does \nx work\u2019 type question), 29% (n=24) used qualitative techniques. Seventeen \npercent (n=14) of the \u2018effectiveness\u2019 studies were reviews, of which only one \nwas a systematic review. Ten percent (n=8) used a before and after design \nand 10% (n=8) mixed qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Two percent \n(n=2) of these studies were document analyses, 2% (n=2) were longitudinal or \ncohort studies, 2% (n=2%) laboratory style experiments and 1% (n=1) a \nsurvey. There were insufficient data to determine the methodologies used in \n12% of the effectiveness studies (n=10) and only four randomised controlled \ntrials were found, comprising 5% of the effectiveness studies and fewer than \n1% of the overall coded studies. Given the methodologies used, it is unlikely \nthat many of these studies would have been able to provide robust evidence \nabout effectiveness. \n \n 13 \nTable 5: Methodology employed by funded studies \nResearch method Frequency Percent \nQualitative 230 37 \nMixed methods (qualitative and \nquantitative component) 108 17 \nLongitudinal\/cohort 74 12 \nDevelopmental descriptive 54 9 \nLiterature review 31 5 \nSurvey 25 4 \nQuantitative dataset analysis 16 3 \nBefore-after 8 1 \nNon-randomised controlled trial 8 1 \nRandomised controlled trial 3 0 \nSystematic review 2 0 \nOther 12 2 \nNo data 54 9 \nTotal 625 100 \n \nWhat we found \n \nThese studies found an overall fit between topics of funded research and topic \npriorities in practice, but a disparity in the types of research questions being \nasked. While the research studies focused mainly on understanding the \nreasons for, and the nature of, social problems, practitioners mainly asked \nquestions about how to solve these problems.  In the light of the Every Child \n 14 \nMatters agenda, the outcomes focus of practitioners is to be welcomed, but \nresearch evidence for the effectiveness of interventions in social care remains  \ndisappointingly thin (Craig, Cook & Fraser 2004; Hawkins & Law 2005; Liabo \n2005; Millward, Kelly & Nutbeam 2003; Roberts et al. 2004).   \n \nDiscussion \n \nOur discussion focuses on two areas. First, how might we interpret the \nevidence about the disjunction between what practitioners wanted and what \nfunders were funding?  And second, what possible reasons might there be for \nthe relative paucity of studies of effectiveness? \n \nWe note that context is important. The welfare state in the UK, the provision of \nfree health care at the point of need, and the long history of at least some \nuniversal services such as health visiting and the early establishment of the \nimportance of, and services for, early years underpin provision. The United \nStates, on the other hand, has a stronger record of trials in this area, but in \ngeneral, worse outcomes for the most disadvantaged children. But while our \npolicy framework and social services are relatively benign in comparison with \nthe United States, we do not have the framework of wider social support and \ninterventions which have enabled the Nordic countries to have the best \noutcomes in the world for children.  \n \nWe believe it is likely, of course, that in this area, as in all areas of frontline \npractice, what practitioners are partly seeking is evidence about what to do in \n 15 \na particular case. Research evidence in general - and certainly in this area \u2013 \nis very rarely of this type. Research can identify possible interventions, or \nchoices, or things that might be worth trying, or things that are unlikely to \nwork, or the context in which any choices must be made. But even if the state \nof our current knowledge were far more advanced, it is unlikely that research \nwould determine what a practitioner should do exactly in a particular case, \ngiven the nature of the problems and the range of issues they will have to \nconsider. We lack the evidence to give even rough probabilistic guidance on \nwhat to do in many situations. As Lipsky (1980:29) has pointed out: \u201c ... street \nlevel bureaucrats [a group which we would take to include social workers] \nwork with a relatively high degree of uncertainty because of the complexity of \nthe subject matter (people) and the frequency or rapidity with which decisions \nhave to be made. Not only is reliable information costly and difficult to obtain \nbut for street level bureaucrats high case loads, episodic encounters, and the \nconstant press of decisions force them to act without even being able to \nconsider whether an investment in searching for more information would be \nprofitable.\u201d7 \n \nThe situation in children\u2019s services is in fact such that research evidence is \nnot yet likely to fully map the terrain of possible interventions or assess their \nclaims to effectiveness across a range of relevant outcomes. Despite the \nhistory to which we refer in the introduction, and the impressive work done by \nBarnardo\u2019s, Research in Practice and others, it is only now, with a strong \n                                                 \n7 We are grateful for Kenneth Macdonald\u2019s webpage which drew this to our attention \nhttp:\/\/www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk\/Users\/Macdonald\/ASS-Ethics\/Exhbt.PDF \n \n 16 \nemphasis on outcomes in children\u2019s services that the thinness of the evidence \non effectiveness is beginning to be widely acknowledged.  \n \nWork done in the 1980s, 1990s and at the start of the 21st century has \ndemonstrated how ineffective some interventions may be in the contexts in \nwhich they have been used. In other areas we have an idea about what the \ncharacteristics of effective interventions might be, but we still have very little \nevidence about what actually works (or how much it works), for whom and in \nwhat contexts. Much of the effectiveness evidence we do have has come from \nthe United States, from which source a common language has tended to \nobscure very different social and welfare contexts. Thus, current studies of \neffectiveness may well not meet the question underpinning practitioners\u2019 \ndesire for research on what works, because they will not tell them what may \nwork with their own populations, in their own social structures, let alone their \ncaseload.  \n \nA second thing that practitioners may reasonably seek from effectiveness \nstudies is evidence relevant to planning services overall.  That too is difficult \ngiven the current evidence. Those studies that we have that look at \neffectiveness tend to compare a new intervention with \u2018normal\u2019 practice in \nways that are not very robust. In a very few cases we have evidence about \nthe comparative costs, but almost none that would help map the comparative \ncosts of a range of interventions against changes in outcomes in a way that \nmight inform some optimum mix of costs and effectiveness (Stevens et al, in \npreparation).   \n 17 \n \nThis is further complicated by the fact that a number of studies (Oakley & \nFullerton 1996; Sefton 2003) have indicated that practitioners, planners and \npolicy makers, like politicians, have a tendency to seek evidence in order to \nargue a case rather than in order to make a decision. Related to this is a \ntendency for untested interventions, promoted by persuasive advocates, to \nengage political interest, and be rolled out before proper piloting and robust \nevaluation (Jowell 2003). \n \nWhy might funders fund so much descriptive work, and often rather small-\nscale descriptive work? Of course, sometimes, descriptive work may be \nneeded to understand just what is happening in \u2018normal services\u2019.  Much of \nthe work in children\u2019s services funded in the 1980s and early 1990s was \nnecessarily of this type, as there was so little extant systematic evidence \nabout what happened to children \u2018in care\u2019.  Descriptive work can also help \ndecision-makers understand why current service delivery has difficulties in \nsome areas or in some types of cases or at some key points in case work, or \nit can inform evaluations of newly introduced statutory frameworks, to see if \nthey are working in the way that was intended. Many of these aims would \nhowever require at least some quantitative descriptive studies, and these are \nthemselves relatively thin on the ground.   \n \nIn general, research training for social scientists in the UK has not been \nstrong on the quantitative side, although this is changing. Combined with a \nprofessional focus of social care professionals on relationships and process (a \n 18 \nconcern from which those in other professions have something to learn), this \nhas tended to result in a high volume of qualitative work. We suspect too that \nqualitative studies are also popular among many social care professionals \nand social care researchers precisely because they feel closer to the \u2018clinical\u2019 \ncase than the abstraction that necessarily comes with numbers. The findings \nfeel as if they have relevance to the day-to-day decisions social workers may \nhave to make, and remind them of the experiences of service users. But \nwithout representative quantitative evidence, evidence that helps map the \nclustering of risk and protective factors, or evidence about effectiveness and \ndifferential impact of different interventions, we do not, in effect, have an \n\u2018epidemiology\u2019 that helps put that \u2018lived texture\u2019 into any wider perspective, \neither descriptively, analytically or causally.   \n \nFrom the point of view of funders, an underlying issue is that studies of \neffectiveness, especially intervention studies, tend to be more expensive than \neither descriptive studies of social work processes or small scale studies of \nuser or practitioner views. On the other hand as others have pointed out \n(Beecham & Sinclair 2007; Research in Practice 2007) while high quality \nevaluative research is expensive, its costs are almost certainly dwarfed by the \ncurrent cost of using resources ineffectively. The solution to these problems \ndepends on the joint efforts of researchers, funders and service agencies.   \n \nThere are further problems. While the UK has an exceptionally strong \nbackground in longitudinal studies, particularly the birth cohort studies, in \ngeneral child welfare, in high quality qualitative research, and in studies \n 19 \nidentifying important problems, for instance inequalities in health and wealth, \nwhich are very pertinent to child welfare, quantitative skills, longitudinal \nanalysis skills and particularly skills in designing trials have historically been in \nrelatively short supply among the UK researchers working on the population \nof children looked after by the state, or with detailed knowledge of the \nstatutory sector of child protection.     \n \nA further difficulty relates to practitioner ambivalence about intervention \nstudies. For example, Hagell and Spencer (2004) found that children\u2019s social \nworkers were unwilling to take part in simple before-and-after tests to see if \nprovision of evidence about research in the form of audiotapes actually \nimproved practitioner knowledge about particular issues. Recent RCTs in \nchildren\u2019s services have reported difficulty in recruiting to trials, even once it \nhas been established that cases were known to exist in the areas approached \n(Witherspoon, personal communication).  In some cases, researchers may \nnot have worked sufficiently closely with practitioners to explain or motivate \nparticipation, but practitioners have also voiced concerns, expressing the view \nthat new interventions would inevitably be \u2018better,\u2019 so that it would be \nunethical to randomise. And the funder author has certainly supported trials \nwhere practitioners wanted to allocate particularly problematic or difficult \ncases (for whom everything else had been tried) to the new intervention, \nrather than allowing a random case mix to receive the new service. Even \nwhere service managers have pledged support for trials, recent end of grant \nsummaries have reported that trials have delivered fewer numbers than any \nrealistic model would suggest because practitioners in the front line had any \n 20 \nor all of these concerns about intervention trials (MTFCE National \nImplementation Team 2008; Rushton & Monck 2009). This is not, of course, a \nconcern restricted to social care (Silverman 1980).  We return to this issue \nbelow.    \n \nTaken together, these supply and demand factors in relation to funding may \nsuggest that the current way of funding research on effectiveness and, \nparticularly, testing the effectiveness of new interventions needs a more \nstrategic approach. Waiting responsively for grant applications is unlikely to \nstimulate the growth of the kind of research capacity that is needed, or to yield \na strategic approach towards studying effectiveness. A strategic approach \nmight also result in more and better longer-term follow-ups (the lack of \nlongitudinal studies in children\u2019s services of even a descriptive kind is \nstriking), and in cumulative learning from interventions that have promising \naspects even if they do not deliver all that we might have hoped.   \n \nAny strategic approach to funding is likely to depend at least partly on the \ndevelopment of \u2018strategic practitioners\u2019, who may well be vital in a number of \nways. First, the record shows that it can be such practitioners who may be \nwell-placed to conceptualise and develop interventions, or hear about them in \nother contexts and consider how they might work in their own field. Second, \nsuch practitioners are often a crucial and consistent bridge in what ought to be \na continuing dialogue between researchers, practitioners and funders, with \nthese practitioners explaining to others why we don\u2019t really know what works, \nwhy the new intervention may not be preferable, why difficulties in allocating \n 21 \ncases can be overcome and so on. Certainly some of the successful centres \nthat have generated a cumulative record of trials invest in having such \n\u2018strategic practitioners\u2019 as a key part of the workforce (for instance, the Office \nof Child Development at the School for Education in the University of \nPittsburgh, or the Nuffield Foundation\u2019s own curriculum centre, which involves \nmany teachers). In the UK children\u2019s care context, the majority of the senior \nmembers of the R&D team in Barnardo\u2019s were qualified and experienced \nsocial workers, who, rather than being in head office, were located alongside \npractitioners and service managers.  \n \nAll this suggests that longer-term funding of research programmes, rather \nthan funding single studies, will be necessary to generate the range of \nevidence that practitioners say they want, that many funders will want and that \nthe users of children\u2019s services deserve. In the UK, given the scale and remit \nof this work, and its inevitable links to policy-making, much of this funding \nwould have to come from government. \n \nTwo basic models may be worth consideration.  First, the funding of research \ncentres of excellence with substantive concentration on particular areas (like \nthe research arm of the newly funded National Academy of Parenting \nPractitioners) or issues may be a way forward. As with the centres funded by \nthe Medical Research Council, such centres would require periodic review, \nand advisory boards with strong representation of research experts as well as \npractice leaders. Staff would include researchers and strategic practitioners. \nBut the key element of the remit would need to be a focus on studies of \n 22 \neffective interventions that pushed the research questions as well as the \navailable answers further in the direction of \u2018what works\u2019. In order to create a \nrobust evidence base relevant to a substantive issue, it would be essential to \ndraw researchers from a variety of disciplines, including psychology, \neconomics, sociology, social statistics and social policy in addition to the \ntraditional \u2018social care\u2019 research workforce. Combining these other research \nskills with those of the existing social care research force (who will know much \nmore about the statutory processes and practice realities), will allow questions \nto be posed in new and different ways, and seem a vital part of improving the \nfocus on outcomes that in turn improves child welfare.  \n \nAnother model might be the creation of a specialist funding agency, like the \nNational Institutes in the USA, part of whose remit is to create such centres of \nexcellence, developing both researcher capacity and practically-focussed \nrobust research. This too would require funding some sorts of centres such as \nthose above, but could take other strategic initiatives to improve research on \nworkforce capacity and to bring researchers from other disciplines into this \nsubstantive area of work.    \n \nWithout strategic interventions of this sort, we are likely to see a continuing \nshortage of evidence about effective interventions and fail to meet the needs \nof those delivering services, those using them, and the reasonable \nrequirement that we build in a stepwise way on the solid work done to identify \nproblems and needs.    \n \n 23 \nAcknowledgements \nThe background to this article was a knowledge exchange meeting for those \ninvolved in the production, funding, use and implementation of research in the \nnew world of children\u2019s services.
