A knowledge of the evolution of mine wastes and dispersion\npatterns is required to reduce concern in respect of the health hazard\nTrace Metals and other Contaminants in the Environment, Volume 9, 431\u2013460\n\u0002 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved\nISSN 0927-5215 \/ doi 10.1016\/S0927-5215(06)09017-5\nassociated with mining activities. Intensive exploitation of metalliferous ore\ndeposits, combined with the natural geochemical dispersion from the copper\u2013\ntin\u2013arsenic mineralisation, has resulted in the creation of a significant area of\nAs-contaminated wastes and soils in southwestern England (Mitchell and\nBarr, 1995). The levels of As contamination in soils and rivers are well\ndocumented (Aston et al., 1975; Colbourn et al., 1975; Abrahams and\nThornton, 1987). However, less attention has been devoted to studying the\nsolid partitioning and speciation of As in the region. In the present study, we\naim to describe the distribution and mobility of As in the wastes formed from\nvarious stages of the ore dressing process of Devon Great Consols Mine, an\nabandoned copper\u2013arsenic mine in West Devon, UK. For this purpose, the\ncomplementary application of direct and indirect methods of analysis has\nbeen used. The information provided can certainly contribute to assessing the\nenvironmental risk related to these mine wastes. This study is part of a larger\nproject carried out by the British Geological Survey to study dispersion of\nmine pollution in the UK (Klinck et al., in press).\n17.2 Materials and methods\n17.2.1 Study area\nThe Devon Great Consols Mine lies on the east bank of the river Tamar in the\nTavistock District in Devon, UK (Fig. 17-1). The mine, deriving from the\nconsolidation of five adjacent mines, worked on lodes mainly consisting\nof chalcopyrite, pyrite and some arsenopyrite and cassitierite with quartz,\nfluorite and brecciated country rock cemented by chlorite or siderite.\nIn the nineteenth century Devon Great Consols was the richest and\nlargest mine in the Tamar valley and an output of over 70 000 t of As between\n1848 and 1909 has been recorded (Dines, 1956). Mining activity at Devon\nGreat Consols ended in 1930.\n17.2.2 Methods of As production\nA comprehensive review of the method of As production at Devon Great\nConsols can be found in Pye and Dixon (1989). The following is a brief\nsummary that outlines the main stages resulting in the output of refined As.\nThe As works, whose features are still partially visible, from 1921 to 1925 was\ninvolved in the processing, calcining, refining and milling of the ore collected\non site.\n432 Arsenic speciation and mobility in mine wastes from a copper\u2013arsenic mine\nThe ore was brought to the As works from the various working mines\nand waste dumps. It was reduced to small pieces by a crusher and then washed\nand sorted by large mechanical sieves powered by waterwheels. The processed\nore was then roasted in a pre-heated furnace, usually between 538\u0003C and\n593\u0003C, when the most efficient sublimation of As occurs. After calcination,\nthe fumes passed along flues in which the grey \u2018crude\u2019 As soot was precipi-\ntated when the temperatures fell below 171\u0003C. After collection from the\ncondensing chambers, the crude As was recalcined to achieve the degree of\npurity (99.5%) necessary for sale. After passing through the condensers, most\nof the unprecipitated arsenic and sulphur fumes were removed in the flue\nprior to emission from the stack, so as to reduce pollution of the surrounding\nland. In the flue, the fumes passed through a water shower over soaked\nwooden beams. Additional limestone within the flue helped reduce further\n##Transe ct\n50\nTranse ct\n100\nDEVON\nTavistock \nDevon Great \nConsols Mine\n0 50 km\n0 100 km\nFig. 17-1: Location of Devon Great Consols Mine\nMaterials and methods 433\nthe sulphur dioxide emission. A high stack (36m) at the end of the flue\nfacilitated the dispersal of the remaining fumes, as well as providing a draught\nfor the calcining furnaces.\n17.2.3 Sample collection and preparation\nThe Devon Great Consols Mine includes the As processing plant and asso-\nciated waste dumps and ponds for the settling out of residues and waste from\nthe crushed ore. At the processing plant, samples were collected from the\ncrusher area (MPS97) where the ore was reduced to pea-sized pieces and from\nthe black furnace slag heaps (MPS73\u2013MPS90). Efflorescent masses of\nAs-bearing salts on the brickwork of the calciner building were also sampled.\nAdditional material was collected from the sandy calciner residues from\nvarious waste dumps scattered throughout the site.\nWhere soil\/waste samples were collected, each sample (0\u201315 cm depth)\nwas made of a composite of material from auger flights taken from five holes\ndistributed within an area of 1m\u0003 1m.\n17.2.4 Analytical methods\nChemical analysis\nAll samples were air-dried and sieved to <250mm. Total element content of\nthe <250mm fraction was obtained by inductively coupled plasma emission\nspectroscopy (ICP-AES) after digestion of the samples with a mixture of\nhydrofluoric, perchloric and nitric acids. The pH was measured in 0.01M\nCaCl2 solution and cation exchange capacity (CEC) by titration.\nPartitioning by sequential extraction\nChemical sequential extraction was carried out in order to characterise ele-\nment partitioning in the solid phase. Two grams of the sample were supported\non a filtration membrane in a centrifuge tube. Extraction was then carried out\nusing first, for steps 1 and 2, de-ionised water (DIW) and then separate\naliquots of HNO3 of increasing concentration, which were passed through\nthe sample under centrifugal force. Each extraction step was carried out twice\n[0.01M (steps 3 and 4), 0.05M (steps 5 and 6), 0.1M (steps 7 and 8), 0.5M\n(steps 9 and 10), 1M (steps 11 and 12), 5M (steps 13 and 14) HNO3] and\n10ml of the leaching solution used. For the 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 5M acid extracts,\n0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1ml, respectively, of hydrogen peroxide were also added\n434 Arsenic speciation and mobility in mine wastes from a copper\u2013arsenic mine\nto each extractant before making up to 10ml volume. The solutions obtained\nwere analysed for major and trace elements by ICP-AES. A data-processing\nalgorithm was used to identify the number of physico-chemical components\nextracted, their composition and the proportion of each in each extract\naccording to the Chemometric Identification of Substrates and Element Dis-\ntributions (CISED) method described in Cave et al. (2004). The chemometric\ndata-processing is based on the assumption that the material is made up of a\nmixture of discrete physico-chemical components characterised by a distinct\nelement composition. Under increasing acid concentration, each physico-\nchemical component will dissolve according to its degree and rate of solubi-\nlity. This non-specific extraction approach has already been shown to have a\nnumber of analytical advantages over traditional specific extraction schemes,\ne.g. Tessier\u2019s scheme and modified versions (Tessier et al., 1979; Li et al.,\n1995), and the CISED method has demonstrated the ability to clearly identify\nphysico-chemical components in the soil which have been confirmed by\nmineralogical analysis (Cave et al., 2004).\nMineralogical and scanning electron microscopy analysis\nSelected tailings samples were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Co\nK\u0002 radiationAU1 . XRD analysis was performed from 3 to 65\u0003 2\u0003 at a scanning\nspeed of 0.7\u0003 2\u0003\/min.\nSeparate samples of tailings and mine spoil, selected to be representative of\ntheminewaste types occurring at the site,were collected in situ in 50mm\u0003 100mm\naluminium boxes (\u2018Kubiena soil tins\u2019) to minimise sampling disturbance and\npreserve any delicate authigenic secondary mineral fabrics. These samples were\nair-dried in the aluminium boxes and then impregnated, under vacuum, with\nepoxy resin to stabilise the material for thin-section preparation. The samples\nwere then cut and prepared as uncovered, polished thin sections.\nThe thin sections were briefly examined with an optical petrographic\nmicroscope (in transmitted and reflected light) prior to detailed petrographic\ncharacterisation using backscattered scanning electron microscopy (BSEM).\nBackscattered scanning electron microscopy observations were made using an\nLEO 435VP variable pressure digital SEM instrument. This was equipped with\na KE Developments four-element solid-state backscattered electron detector,\nand an Oxford Instruments ISIS 300 digital energy-dispersive X-ray microana-\nlysis system. The SEM instrument was operated in the low vacuum mode, at a\nvacuum of 0.3\u20130.4 torr, enabling the polished thin sections to be observed\nwithout the need for coating the samples with an electrically conductive film.\nObservations were recorded using a beam accelerating potential of 10\u201320kV,\nMaterials and methods 435\nprobe currents of 100\u2013700pA, and a working distance of 18\u201325mm. Mineral\nidentifications were based on the evaluation of semi-qualitative microchemical\ninformation obtained from EDXA spectra recorded simultaneously during\nBSEM observation. In addition, SEM observations were made on individual\ngrains loosely dispersed onto a carbon adhesive tab and sputter coated with a\nconductive layer of gold metal. The efflorescent masses of As-bearing salts on\nthe brickwork at the furnace site were also analysed.\nX-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis\nX-ray absorption spectra at the As K-edge were collected on Station 16.5 at\nthe CLRC Daresbury SRS operating at 2GeV with an average current\nof 140mA, using a vertically focussing mirror and a sagitally bent focussing\nSi(2 2 0) double crystal monochromator detuned to 80% transmission to\nminimise harmonic rejection. Data were collected with the station operating\nin fluorescence mode using an Ortec 30-element solid-state Ge detector.\nExperiments were performed at ambient temperature. Single scans were suffi-\ncient for most samples, but for two dilute samples multiple scans were\ncollected and averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.\nBackground-subtracted extended X-ray absorption fine structure\n(EXAFS spectroscopy) spectra were analysed in EXCURV98 using full-\ncurved wave theory (Gurman et al., 1984; Binsted, 1998). Phase shifts were\nderived in the program from ab initio calculations using Hedin\u2013Lundqvist\npotentials and von Barth ground states (Hedin and Lundqvist, 1969). Fourier\ntransforms of the EXAFS spectra were used to obtain an approximate radial\ndistribution function around the central As atom (the absorber atom); the\npeaks of the Fourier transform can be related to \u2018shells\u2019 of surrounding\nbackscattering atoms characterised by atom type, number of atoms in the\nshell, the absorber\u2013scatterer distance, and the Debye\u2013Waller factor, 2\u00042\n(a measure of both the thermal motion between the absorber and scatterer\nand of the static disorder or range of absorber\u2013scatterer distances). The data\nwere fitted for each sample by defining a theoretical model and comparing the\ncalculated EXAFS spectrum with the experimental data. Shells of backscat-\nterers were added around the As and by refining an energy correction Ef (the\nFermi energy), the absorber\u2013scatterer distance and Debye\u2013Waller factor for\neach shell, a least-squares residual, the R-factor (Binsted et al., 1992), was\nminimised. For the first shell of scatterers around the As, the number of\natoms in the shell was chosen as the integer that gave the best fit but was\nnot further refined. Arbitrary numbers of atoms were chosen for the outer\nshells.\n436 Arsenic speciation and mobility in mine wastes from a copper\u2013arsenic mine\n17.2.5 Thermodynamic data\nSimulations were performed using the geochemical model PHREEQC\n(Parkhurst, 1995) with the WATEQ4F thermodynamic database (Ball and\nNordstrom, 1991) (Table 17-1) for the purpose of calculating the degree of\nsaturation of the minerals in equilibrium with the water leachates extracted in\nthe first two steps of the sequential extraction. Solubility data for weillite\nCaHAsO4, olivenite Cu2(AsO4)(OH) and conichalcite CaCu(AsO4)(OH) were\nadded from the database compiled by Gaskova et al. (2001).\nThe degree of saturation of a mineral with respect to the solution in\ncontact with the mineral is expressed as saturation index (SI). The SI is\ncalculated from the equation:\nSI \u00bc Log\u00f0IAP=Kss\u00de \u00f017-1\u00de\nwhere IAP is the ionic activity product of the specific reaction and Kss is the\nequilibrium constant (Table 17-1).\n17.3 Results and discussion\n17.3.1 Bulk chemistry of the tailings and mine wastes\nAll tailings and mine waste samples exhibit elevated As values with a range\nfrom 1280 to 205 000mg\/kg (Table 17-2). Samples are also typically enriched\nin iron (39 600\u2013306 000mg\/kg) and in many samples high sulphur content is\ndisplayed (up to 22 400mg\/kg). Copper contents range between 27 and\n20 900mg\/kg. Sample MPS73, the black furnace slag material mixed with\nwaste rocks and bricks, shows the highest concentrations of arsenic, copper\nand zinc. Low acidic pH is also characteristic of the tailings and mine waste.\nThe only sample showing a neutral pH of 7 was taken from the area of the\nrelict ore crusher (MPS97). This higher pH together with relatively enriched\ncalcium content might be due to the practice of lime addition during the ore\nprocessing described by Pye and Dixon (1989).\n17.3.2 Mineralogic\/petrographic characterisation\nSandy tailings\nThe mineralogy of the sandy tailings, based on XRD analysis, is dominated\nby the gangue minerals (quartz, mica and chlorite). Minor amounts of pyrite,\narsenopyrite, cassitierite and fluorite are also present.

and discussion 441\ndetection limit of XRD analysis (\u00045%) negates the detection of As secondary\nminerals. Scanning electron microscopy analysis identifies largely angular\nfragments of quartz, rock fragments composed dominantly of illite, illite\u2013\nquartz or illite\u2013quartz\u2013chlorite\u2013feldspar (possibly pelite or slate). Most of the\nillitic and chloritic rock fragments (which may also include sericitic frag-\nments) are heavily impregnated or partially replaced by very fine iron oxy-\nhydroxides. Fragments of partially altered hydrothermal mineralisation\ncontaining arsenopyrite, often associated with quartz and siderite, are com-\nmon minor constituents. Some of the arsenopyrite are fresh; but it commonly\ndisplays partial alteration to iron oxyhydroxides. Altered pyrite (partially\nreplaced by fine gel-like iron oxyhydroxide) and pyrite\u2013quartz fragments are\nalso present but are much less abundant than arsenopyrite. Small cassiterite\ngrains are present in trace amounts. All of the rock and mineral fragments are\ncoated with a thin film of iron oxyhydroxide (Fig. 17-2) that may be up to\n50mm thick. This oxide also forms delicate arcuate structures that bridge pore\nthroats between adjacent grains, weakly cementing the tailings particles. It\nappears to have been formed by precipitation of the iron oxyhydroxide\nwithin, or on, meniscus films of water between adjacent grains, indicating\nformation within the tailings under partially saturated groundwater condi-\ntions (i.e. capillary pore water). The iron oxyhydroxide films have finely\nbanded colloform texture, and often display shrinkage cracks indicating\nthat they may have been quite a hydrous gel originally. Semi-quantitative\nEDXA also indicates that the iron oxyhydroxide grain-coating cement usually\ncontains a small amount of As, typically between <0.5% and 3% As2O3.\nBlack furnace slag\nScanning electron microscopy analysis of the black slag shows that the\nmaterial is composed mainly of sand- to gravel-sized fragments of ash or\nslag, altered illite\u2013quartz slate or pelite rock fragments, rock fragments heav-\nily mineralised (or replaced) by hematite and\/or iron oxyhydroxide, fragments\nof intergrown quartz and hematite\/iron oxyhydroxide mineralisation (possi-\nbly gossan material), and simple quartz fragments. Minor amounts of altered\ntin mineralisation are also present. The ash or slag fragments are composed of\nhighly microporous glassy material with globular pores or vesicles, which are\nimpregnated and lined by films of iron oxyhydroxide (Fig. 17-2). Detailed\nBSEM observations show that the iron-rich coatings have a complex micro-\nfabric. They consist mainly of an earlier layer of finely banded colloform iron\noxyhydroxide, which rests directly on the grain surfaces, or lines pores and\ndissolution cavities. It typically displays irregular shrinkage microfractures,\n442 Arsenic speciation and mobility in mine wastes from a copper\u2013arsenic mine\n20 \u00b5m Photo no. = 7 MAG = 901 X EHT = 15.00 kVDetector = QBSDWD = 19 mm\n(a)\n10 \u00b5m Photo no. = 4 MAG = 770 X EHT = 15.00 kVDetector = QBSDWD = 19 mm\n(b)\n20 \u00b5m Photo no. = 7 MAG = 505 X EHT = 15.00 kVDetector = QBSDWD = 19 mm\n(c)\n10 \u00b5m Photo no. = 12 MAG = 2.61 KX EHT = 15.00 kVDetector = QBSDWD = 19 mm\n(d)\nFig. 17-2: (a) Sample of tailings.

Detail of As-rich Fe oxyhydroxide cement\ncoating the surfaces of altered waste fragments. It shows banded collo-\nform oxyhydroxide gel material displaying shrinkage (desiccation)\ncracks. This is encrusted by more crystalline acicular oxyhydroxide\nResults and discussion 443\nindicating that it was originally hydrous. This shrinkage may have taken place\nas a result of the sample drying out during collection and subsequent thin-\nsection preparation. A later generation of more crystalline iron oxyhydroxide\nforms an outer coating of fine needle-like crystals resting on the colloform\niron oxyhydroxide. EDXA observations indicate that the iron oxyhydroxide\nusually contains several percent of silica. It can also be As-rich, varying in\ncomposition from <0.5% As2O3 up to approximately 30% As2O3 (based on\nsemi-quantitative EDXA observations).\nOre crusher area\nBackscattered scanning electron microscopy analysis of the material adjacent\nto the ore crusher shows common arsenopyrite grains. A secondary phase\ncomposed of iron, arsenic and calcium often rims the sulphide grains. Semi-\nquantitative EDXA also indicates that the grain-coating cement usually con-\ntains high As, typically between 24% and 45% As2O3, high iron, between\n41% and 47% Fe2O3 and minor calcium, between 3% and 9% CaO. Discrete,\nsand-sized, white aggregates, commonly observed in the waste, show the same\ncomposition. Fe\/As molar ratios between 1 and 1.5 are indicative of arsenate\nminerals, while Fe\/As molar ratios greater than 1.5 are considered to be As-\nrich iron oxyhydroxides (Paktunc et al., 2004). The Fe\/As and Ca\/As molar\nratios of the analysed grains of \u00041.4 and 0.4, respectively, point towards\ncalcium\u2013iron arsenate compositions. Presence of arsenolite (As2O3) is also\nfound.\nEfflorescences\nThe white\u2013pink efflorescent masses found on the brickwork at the furnace site\nare made of microcrystalline gypsum (XRD analysis). Intimate association of\ngypsum (CaSO4\u00022H2O) and As is evidenced by SEM\u2013EDXA, possibly as\namorphous calcium arsenate coatings or as solid\u2013solution\/coprecipitates\nwith gypsum.\n17.3.3 Arsenic partitioning by sequential extractions\nThe black slag material MPS90, the sandy tailings sample MPS91 and the\nsample from the ore crusher area MPS97 were chemically extracted using\nincreasing concentrations of HNO3, followed by ICP-AES analysis of the\nmajor and trace elements of the extract. In order to identify the solid-phase\npartitioning of As, the data were subjected to the CISED chemometric\n444 Arsenic speciation and mobility in mine wastes from a copper\u2013arsenic mine\ndata-processing procedure as described in section 17.2. The CISED extraction\nmethodology and associated data processing identifies a number of different,\ngeochemically distinct, components for each sample, named on the basis of\nthe prevailing elemental composition. The following outputs from processing\nthe CISED extraction data were generated: a series of extraction profiles of\nthe total mass of extracted elements against reagent concentration (steps\n1\u201314) (Fig. 17-3) for each sample (one profile for each identified component);\na table of the elemental composition of each identified component (Table 17-3),\nand information relating to the distribution of As determined within each\nidentified component (Fig. 17-4).\nIn all samples, the component which makes up the most significant\npercentage of the total extract contains mainly iron (Fig. 17-3). The\nelemental composition of this component shown in Table 17-3 corresponds\nto iron oxyhydroxide phases, which can contain variable minor amounts of\ncalcium, arsenic, sulphur, silicon and aluminium (Paktunc et al., 2004).\nThis main component is extracted over the range 0.5\u20135M HNO3 (steps\n9\u201314) with more defined windows of extraction at 0.5M HNO3 and 5M\nHNO3 (Fig. 17-3). These iron-dominated components are always the phases\nwhere As is mainly partitioned (Fig. 17-4). In particular, in the sandy\ntailings and the black slag, two iron-rich components are identified, one\niron-dominated and with high As content (extracted at 5M HNO3) and\nanother one richer in calcium and lower in arsenic, which is leached at an\nearlier stage in the extraction (0.1\u20130.5M HNO3). The degree of iron\noxyhydroxide crystallinity and trace element content are both factors con-\nsistent with observed different mineral dissolution rates in the acid extracts.\nAccordingly, the CISED extraction profiles confirm the coexistence of\nvarious As-bearing iron phases, as shown by SEM observations. In the\nore crusher area, As is more evenly partitioned. Of particular note is an\nidentifiable water soluble component, which releases more than 1000mg\/kg\nof As (4% of the original As content). A component made of 78% calcium\nand 12% arsenic is also identified with a diffuse window of extraction in\nthe range 0.01\u20130.5M HNO3 in this material.\n17.3.4 Arsenic speciation by X-ray absorption spectroscopy\nX-ray absorption near edge structure spectra\nX-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra collected from a\nselection of mine tailings and slag material are shown in Fig. 17-5.

There are outer shells evident in all\nthe Fourier transforms. In most cases, the EXAFS oscillations giving rise to\nthese could be fitted using silicon, arsenic or iron backscatterers. However,\niron at ca. 2.86 A\u02da usually gave the best fit and the fit was usually improved\nfurther by addition of a second shell of iron at ca. 3.34 A\u02da. These results imply\neither adsorption of the As onto an iron oxyhydroxide substrate or incor-\nporation of the As into a mixed metal oxide phase. Previous EXAFS spectro-\nscopy study by Foster et al. (1998), Randall et al. (2001) and Savage et al.\n(2000) indicated arsenate tetrahedra sorbed onto the fine-grained iron-rich\nweathering products of As mine tailings. The two different As\u2013Fe distances\nmay reflect the presence of doubly oxo-bridged and singly oxo-bridged\nspecies. Table 17-4 lists the parameters of the best fits.\nNo indication of the presence of As bound in arsenopyrite or arsenical\npyrite seems to contradict the findings from SEM observations. However,\nEXAFS analysis of heterogeneous materials is complicated by the presence of\noverlapping peaks, multi-atom shells and increased disorder due to the pre-\nsence of poorly crystalline phases (Foster et al., 1998); and lack of sensitivity\nto minor forms of an element is a major obstacle using EXAFS (Isaure et al.,\n2002). The EXAFS signal is a weighted average of all chemical species of an\nelement and the ability to discriminate between multiple element forms\ndepends on their relative abundance.\nTable 17-4: Best-fit parameters for the As K-edge EXAFS spectra\nSample Scatterer N r (A\u02da) 2\u00042 (A\u02da2) R-factor\nMPS90 O 4 1.69 0.006 23\nFe 2 2.85 0.033\nFe 1 3.37 0.017\nMPS91 O 4 1.69 0.006 22\nFe 2 2.86 0.035\nFe 1 3.33 0.011\nMPM4 O 4 1.69 0.007 26\nFe 2 2.85 0.035\nFe 1 3.33 0.011\nMPS15 O 4 1.69 0.004 21\nFe 2 2.85 0.032\nFe 1 3.33 0.008\n452 Arsenic speciation and mobility in mine wastes from a copper\u2013arsenic mine\n17.3.5 Arsenic in water leachates\nThe first two steps of the sequential extraction using DIW as the leaching\nagent represent a fraction subject to instantaneous dissolution\/desorption\nupon wetting. This fraction gives an indication of the potential mobility of\nAs in the studied material. The results for a selection of samples are reported\nin Table 17-5.\nThe DIW leaching, defined in terms of release of the element per kilo-\ngram of material, varies widely from 0.1 to 1440mg\/kg As (Table 17-5). In\npercentage terms, the total As content ranges from 0.0004% to 3.70%, with\nthe highest leachability in the ore crusher area material (MPS97) and the\nlowest in the sandy tailings (MPM1\u2013MPM4\u2013MPM9). This is despite the\ncomparable total As concentration.\n17.3.6 Thermodynamic calculations\nThe saturation indices (SI) of the DIW leachates with respect to arsenates,\niron and aluminium oxyhydroxides and sulphates were calculated using\nPHREEQC (Parkhurst, 1995) and measured pH, Eh and temperature data\n(Table 17-6). Based on the available thermodynamic data, the DIW leachate\nsolutions are undersaturated with respect to all arsenate phases, i.e. there is\nnot an arsenate mineral which controls the concentration of dissolved As in\nthe leachates of the tailings and slag. Goethite is slightly supersaturated,\nsuggesting dissolution of iron oxyhydroxides as the controlling phase on As\nin the leachates through dissolution\/desorption. In contrast, in response to\nthe higher pH, the leachates of the ore crusher material are supersaturated in\nweillite, scorodite and arsenate phases of copper, calcium\u2013copper and alu-\nminium (Table 17-6), as well as in goethite and Fe(OH)3(a), which all con-\ntribute to dissolved As. Arsenolite is strongly undersaturated in the ore\ncrusher material leachate. However, it is important to point out that the\nspeciation model calculates saturation indices based on chemical equilibrium\nbetween minerals and water and assumes very fast reactions. Speciation\ncalculations are complicated by uncertainty in the values of thermodynamic\nconstants for mineral phases, as only pure phases are considered in the\navailable databases and equilibrium constants of naturally occurring solid\u2013\nsolutions may differ significantly from these values (Sracek et al., 2004).\nNevertheless, the model gives useful information on the possible suite of\nmineral phases controlling As in solution under certain defined physico-\nchemical conditions.\nResults and discussion 453\nT\na\nb\nle\n1\n7\n-5\n:\nC\no\nm\np\no\nsi\nti\no\nn\no\nf\nw\na\nte\nr\nle\na\nch\na\nte\ns\nA\nl\nA\nU\n5\n(m\ng\n\/\nk\ng\n)\nA\ns\n(m\ng\n\/\nk\ng\n)\nC\na\n(m\ng\n\/\nk\ng\n)\nC\nu\n(m\ng\n\/\nk\ng\n)\nF\ne\n(m\ng\n\/\nk\ng\n)\nK (m\ng\n\/\nk\ng\n)\nM\ng\n(m\ng\n\/\nk\ng\n)\nM\nn\n(m\ng\n\/\nk\ng\n)\nN\na\n(m\ng\n\/\nk\ng\n)\nS (m\ng\n\/\nk\ng\n)\nS\ni\n(m\ng\n\/\nk\ng\n)\nZ\nn\n(m\ng\n\/\nk\ng\n)\nA\ns w\n(% A\ns t\no\nt)\nT\na\nil\nin\ng\ns\nM\nP\nS\n2\n3\n2\n5\n.4\n3\n.9\n9\n6\n0\n.5\n1\n5\n.7\n2\n.5\n9\n1\n3\n.8\n7\n.5\n1\n2\n.5\n3\n1\n5\n.0\n4\n3\n.4\n9\n.5\n2\n1\n.2\n2\n0\n.0\n1\n7\nM\nP\nS\n4\n3\n1\n.2\n7\n0\n.6\n5\n2\n1\n5\n.9\n1\n.1\n7\n4\n.4\n1\n9\n.6\n9\n2\n.3\n4\n0\n.1\n7\n8\n3\n.0\n5\n1\n1\n0\n2\n.0\n9\n1\n.2\n9\n0\n.0\n0\n8\nM\nP\nM\n1\n1\n1\n.3\n0\n.0\n9\n0\n6\n7\n.2\n6\n.2\n8\n1\n9\n.1\n<2\n.5\n0\n2\n.7\n3\n0\n.5\n5\n0\n0\n.5\n5\n5\n1\n6\n3\n2\n.7\n4\n0\n.1\n2\n6\n0\n.0\n0\n0\nM\nP\nM\n4\n1\n1\n.4\n4\n.0\n1\n7\n7\n.3\n9\n.3\n4\n1\n0\n6\n<2\n.5\n0\n3\n.8\n1\n0\n.6\n9\n5\n1\n.2\n1\n3\n1\n0\n3\n.3\n3\n0\n.2\n1\n2\n0\n.0\n0\n5\nM\nP\nM\n9\n1\n6\n6\n1\n.1\n7\n2\n4\n1\n1\n4\n.9\n1\n1\n.2\n1\n1\n4\n4\n3\n.0\n5\n.6\n3\n1\n2\n.3\n4\n3\n2\n4\n7\n.3\n2\n.2\n8\n0\n.0\n0\n5\nM\nP\nS\n9\n1\n6\n8\n.0\n0\n.3\n0\n1\n1\n3\n8\n2\n.4\n4\n1\n.4\n4\n1\n2\n6\n5\n3\n.1\n5\n.1\n1\n1\n7\n.8\n2\n6\n3\n2\n5\n.3\n0\n.2\n2\n9\n0\n.0\n0\n2\nM\nP\nS\n9\n2\n4\n8\n.0\n6\n.4\n6\n1\n4\n1\n0\n.9\n0\n6\n1\n.0\n5\n1\n0\n4\n1\n7\n.0\n1\n.7\n9\n2\n6\n.1\n1\n7\n2\n2\n4\n.4\n0\n.3\n5\n3\n0\n.0\n3\n4\nS\nla\ng\nM\nP\nS\n7\n3\n2\n4\n.3\n4\n9\n9\n7\n9\n.3\n8\n.2\n7\n0\n.0\n5\n0\n4\n8\n.3\n4\n.6\n3\n1\n.6\n5\n2\n6\n.9\n5\n.8\n5\n3\n.5\n1\n4\n.0\n1\n0\n.2\n4\n4\nM\nP\nS\n9\n0\n1\n6\n4\n1\n.0\n3\n3\n2\n9\n7\n.1\n3\n5\n.8\n3\n1\n4\n4\n3\n0\n.9\n1\n6\n.5\n4\n8\n.9\n5\n0\n3\n3\n9\n.5\n3\n.8\n6\n0\n.0\n0\n9\nO\nre\ncr\nu\nsh\ner\nm\na\nte\nri\na\nl\nM\nP\nS\n9\n7\n0\n.8\n7\n4\n1\n4\n4\n0\n4\n5\n9\n0\n.2\n6\n9\n0\n.4\n3\n1\n9\n2\n.2\n1\n9\n.1\n0\n.1\n7\n0\n2\n1\n.6\n4\n9\n.2\n2\n1\n.8\n0\n.0\n2\n5\n3\n.7\n0\n454 Arsenic speciation and mobility in mine wastes from a copper\u2013arsenic mine\nT\na\nb\nle\n1\n7\n-6\n:\nS\na\ntu\nra\nti\no\nn\nin\nd\nex\no\nf\nse\nle\nct\ned\nm\nin\ner\na\nl\np\nh\na\nse\ns\nin\nth\ne\nD\nIW\nle\na\nch\na\nte\ns\nM\nP\nS\n7\n3\nM\nP\nS\n9\n0\nM\nP\nS\n9\n7\nM\nP\nS\n9\n2\nM\nP\nS\n9\n1\nM\nP\nM\n9\nM\nP\nM\n4\nM\nP\nM\n1\nM\nP\nS\n4\n3\nM\nP\nS\n2\n3\np\nH\n4\n.1\n3\n.4\n7\n.1\n4\n.5\n4\n.0\n3\n.5\n2\n.8\n3\n.5\n2\n.9\n3\n.9\nS\nI_\ng\ny\np\nsu\nm\n-4\n.1\n-2\n.0\n-3\n.6\n-2\n.6\n-2\n.6\n-2\n.2\n-2\n.8\n-3\n.0\n-3\n.7\n-3\n.5\nS\nI_\ng\nib\nb\nsi\nte\n-0\n.4\n-1\n.7\n2\n.1\n1\n.0\n-0\n.3\n-1\n.5\n-4\n.6\n-2\n.4\n-5\n.2\n-0\n.8\nS\nI_\ng\no\net\nh\nit\ne\n1\n.2\n-1\n.0\n7\n.9\n0\n.9\n0\n.3\n-0\n.4\n-1\n.5\n-0\n.1\n-2\n.5\n0\n.2\nS\nI_\nF\ne(\nO\nH\n) 3\n(a\n)\n-4\n.6\n-6\n.8\n2\n.0\n-5\n.0\n-5\n.6\n-6\n.3\n-7\n.4\n-6\n.0\n-8\n.4\n-5\n.7\nS\nI_\nja\nro\nsi\nte\n-K\n-1\n7\n-1\n8\n-5\n.4\n-1\n6\n-1\n6\n-1\n7\n-2\n0\n-1\n8\n-2\n3\n-1\n8\nS\nI_\nA\ns 2\nO\n5\n-1\n7\n-2\n1\n-1\n5\n-2\n2\n-2\n3\n-2\n1\n-2\n1\n-2\n4\n-2\n2\n-2\n1\nS\nI_\nF\neA\nsS\n-7\n1\n-6\n2\n<-\n1\n0\n0\n-7\n9\n-7\n2\n-6\n3\n-5\n3\n-6\n5\n-5\n7\n-7\n0\nS\nI_\nA\nlA\nsO\n4\n\u00022H\n2\nO\n-1\n.9\n-5\n.2\n1\n.4\n-2\n.8\n-4\n.9\n-5\n.0\n-7\n.9\n-7\n.2\n-9\n.0\n-4\n.2\nS\nI_\nC\na\n3\n(A\nsO\n4\n) 2\n\u00024w\n-1\n9\n-2\n5\n2\n.2\n-2\n0\n-2\n5\n-2\n5\n-3\n1\n-2\n9\n-3\n3\n<-\n1\n0\n0\nS\nI_\nC\nu\n2\n(A\nsO\n4\n)(\nO\nH\n)\n-3\n.0\n-8\n.0\n6\n.8\n<-\n1\n0\n0\n-7\n.6\n-7\n.0\n-1\n0\n-8\n.9\n-1\n2\n-5\n.2\nS\nI_\nC\na\nC\nu\n(A\nsO\n4\n)(\nO\nH\n)\n-0\n.7\n-5\n.0\n1\n1\n<-\n1\n0\n0\n-4\n.6\n-4\n.5\n-7\n.9\n-6\n.6\n-9\n.3\n-3\n.3\nS\nI_\nsc\no\nro\nd\nit\ne\n-5\n.2\n-9\n.4\n2\n.2\n-7\n.9\n-9\n.3\n-8\n.9\n-9\n.9\n-9\n.9\n-1\n1\n-8\n.2\nS\nI_\na\nrs\nen\no\nli\nte\n-2\n1\n-2\n3\n-4\n2\n-3\n4\n-3\n3\n-2\n5\n-1\n8\n-3\n0\n-2\n1\n<-\n1\n0\n0\nS\nI_\nw\nei\nll\nit\ne\n-5\n.1\n-7\n.9\n2\n.2\n-6\n.4\n-8\n.2\n-8\n.0\n-9\n.7\n-9\n.7\n-1\n1\n-7\n.6\nResults and discussion 455\n17.4 Geochemical controls on As mobilisation\nIron oxyhydroxides are the most significant As carriers in the mine wastes from\nDevon Great Consols Mine. Petrographic evidence suggests iron oxyhydroxide\nfilms with variable As content precipitating from pore water solutions circulating\nin the tailings and waste tips. In addition, As occurs in calcium\u2013iron arsenates\nrimming ore particles in the ore crusher material and calcium arsenates in\nefflorescences extensively covering the calciner brickwork. In the first two\nDIW CISED extractions, low As solubility as a percentage of total As was\nmeasured in the mine wastes. This indicates the role of the iron oxyhydroxides\nas stable As binding phases in an oxidising acid environment, as well documen-\nted by many authors (Bowell et al., 1994; Garcia-Sanchez et al., 2002). However,\nhigher As release was measured in the ore crusher sample with pH 7 and an iron\u2013\ncalcium\u2013arsenic association. Neutral-alkaline conditions promote desorption of\nAs bound to iron oxyhydroxides (Pierce andMoore, 1982) as well as dissolution\nof thermodynamically unstable iron and calcium arsenate minerals (Dove and\nRimstidt, 1985; Paktunc et al., 2004). Arsenate mineral solubilities increase from\nferric arsenates to calcium arsenates (Rochette et al., 1998; Paktunc et al., 2003).\nBoth factors might account for the higher As release from the crusher material.\n17.5 Future directions\nThe complementary use of SEM, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)\nanalysis and sequential chemical extraction methods discussed in this work\nhave proved to constitute a useful tool to determine As solid-phase speciation\nand to evaluate the geochemical controls on As mobility. This information is\ncritical for risk assessment and management of As-contaminated environ-\nment. As analytical techniques improve and are made more available, more\ncomprehensive approaches in the characterisation of mine waste are envi-\nsaged. Further work on this basis will contribute to the development of best\nwaste-management practices for mine sites.\nAcknowledgements\nThis study is published with the permission of the Director, British Geological\nSurvey (NERC).
