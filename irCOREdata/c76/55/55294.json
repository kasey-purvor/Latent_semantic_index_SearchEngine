INTRODUCTION\nIce from the interior of Antarctica is delivered to ice shelves\nand oceans through fast-flowing ice streams and glaciers. The\nice streams flow up to two orders of magnitude faster than the\nsurrounding ice and they are the most dynamic components\nof the ice-sheet system. These fast-flowing ice streams pro-\nvide a connection between the floating ice shelves, which\nhave relatively short-period responses, and the slower-\nmoving inland ice sheet with a longer response time.\nGlobal positioning system (GPS) receivers, which use\ndata from satellites and do not need a visible reference\npoint, are now commonly used in glaciological fieldwork.\nThis method, with high temporal resolution and rigorous\nprocessing methods (King, 2004), has provided the break-\nthrough required to observe short-term changes in ice flow\nand to study ice dynamics on timescales that have not\npreviously been accessible (e.g. O\u2019Neel and others, 2001;\nDoake and others, 2002; Anandakrishnan and others, 2003;\nBindschadler and others, 2003b; Legre\u00b4sy and others, 2004;\nGudmundsson, 2006). In addition, the deployment of\npassive seismic recording stations that monitor microearth-\nquakes has proven to be valuable in mapping ice-stream\nbasal conditions (Blankenship and others, 1987; Ananda-\nkrishnan and Bentley, 1993; Smith, 2006). Combining the\ntwo observation methods is a novel way to enhance the\nunderstanding of ice-stream dynamics and to relate what\nhappens at the bed to the resulting flow regime.\nIt is now possible to observe highly variable flow\ndynamics and basal conditions on the ice streams in Ant-\narctica and there appear to be some similarities, but also\ndifferences, between the ice streams that have been meas-\nured. On the Siple Coast, several ice-stream flow dynamics\nhave been characterized. The speed of Bindschadler Ice\nStream (former Ice Stream D) has been measured to vary by\na factor of three over the course of a day (Anandakrishnan\nand others, 2003). At the grounding line the ice stream\nspeeds up during falling tide and slows during rising tide.\nThis effect was observed to propagate upstream at 5.6m s\u20131\nand can be detected at least 80 km upstream. On the ice\nplain at the mouth of Whillans Ice Stream (former Ice Stream\nB), Bindschadler and others (2003b) showed a strong stick\u2013\nslip motion behaviour, where the ice stream accelerates to\nspeeds greater than 1mh\u20131 (30 times faster than normal) in\nas little as 30 s. This flow behaviour has been modelled with\nvarying ocean back pressure, as the adjacent ice shelf flexes\nwith the tides (Bindschadler and others, 2003a). On Kamb\nIce Stream (former Ice Stream C), there is an anticorrelation\nbetween mean basal seismicity (averaged over many days)\nand mean flow speed (Anandakrishnan and Alley, 1997a).\nOn shorter timescales, periods of basal seismic activity, at a\nsite 10 km from the grounding line, correlate with low tide\non the ice shelf. In this case, the tidal forcing travels up the\nice stream at \u00021.6m s\u20131 (Anandakrishnan and Alley, 1997b).\nOn the opposite side of West Antarctica, where ice flows\ninto the Filchner\u2013Ronne Ice Shelf, the surface velocity of\nRutford Ice Stream has been measured to vary with a\nfortnightly period up to 40 km upstream from the grounding\nline; close to the grounding line the variation is about 20%\n(Gudmundsson, 2006). The longest available velocity\nrecord, of \u00022 years, reveals that this variability also occurs\nat annual and semi-annual periods with higher and more\nJournal of Glaciology, Vol. 54, No. 187, 2008 715\nvariable velocity around equinoxes (21 March and 22 Sep-\ntember) compared to variations around solstices (21 June\nand 21 December), when most measurements are made\n(Murray and others, 2007). These observations indicate that\nice streams are sensitive to sea level with a short response\ntime and could respond rapidly to changes in the mean sea\nlevel or any consequent changes in tidal range.\nIn this paper, surface velocities derived from GPS position\nmeasurements and passive seismic data from Rutford Ice\nStream, 40 km upstream from the grounding line, are presen-\nted. The GPS measurements were recorded during a 6week\nperiod in 2004\/05, and the passive seismic data 7 years\npreviously during a 4week period in 1997. These data show\na complex interaction between ocean tides, basal condition\nand ice-stream flow speed.\n2. LOCATION\nRutford Ice Stream is part of the West Antarctic ice sheet\n(WAIS). It flows in a south-southeast direction until it dis-\ncharges into the Ronne Ice Shelf (Fig. 1). It is estimated that\nthe area that feeds the Rutford Ice Stream is \u000249000 km2,\nwhich includes the northern part of the Ellsworth Mountains\nand borders the drainage basins of Pine Island Glacier,\nCarlson Inlet and Evans Ice Stream (Doake and others, 2001).\nThe thickness of the ice stream is \u00022 km, and the ice is\ngrounded below sea level along its entire length. The surface\nelevation of the grounded areas is >30m above that needed\nfor hydrostatic equilibrium (Doake and others, 1987).\nGround and airborne radio-echo sounding measurements\non the ice stream have revealed variable ice thickness; the\nbed across the ice stream is W-shaped, with deep trenches\nrunning parallel to the flow (Stephenson and Doake, 1982).\nThe location of the grounding line has been found by use of\ntiltmeters and flexure analysis (Stephenson and Doake,\n1982; Stephenson, 1984; Smith, 1991) and synthetic aper-\nture radar interferometry (Rignot, 1998). The ice-stream bed\nat the grounding line is \u00021500m below sea level and the\nbasal topography is complicated. There is a pinning point on\nwhich the ice rests in the centre of the ice stream, which\ncoincides with a topographic high in the bed (Doake and\nothers, 1987), and interferograms reveal areas of partial\ngrounding on the ice shelf (Rignot, 1998).\nRepeated seismic surveys on the ice stream, undertaken\nin the same area as the measurements presented here, have\nshown that there are both spatial (Smith, 1997a, b) and tem-\nporal (Smith and others, 2007) variations in the basal\nconditions. Despite a relatively steady ice-flow rate, rapid\nerosion, drumlin formation and changing hydrology have\nbeen observed over a short period of time (<6 years) (Smith\nand others, 2007).\n2.1. GPS array\nA network of five GPS receivers was installed \u000240 km up-\nstream from the grounding line of Rutford Ice Stream during\nthe 2004\/05 field season. The data were collected from\n17 December 2004 to 10 February 2005. A reference station\ninstalled on rock 31 km away in the Ellsworth Mountains\nmeasured continuously for 34.5 days (31 December to\n3 February). Data from the reference station enabled those\nfrom the ice-stream receivers to be processed to a high\naccuracy, and in this paper we consider only data recorded\nwhilst the reference station was in operation. The locations of\nthe field site, the reference station and the ice-stream stations\nare shown in Figure 1. The other four stations were estab-\nlished directly upstream, downstream and in both directions\nacross the ice stream, each one \u00023 km from the central site.\nThis geometry was designed primarily for a passive seismic\narray in which some stations were located at the same sites as\nthe GPS receivers. All the GPS receivers (reference and ice-\nstream stations) recorded data at 10 s intervals. This high-\nresolution sampling rate was chosen in order to be able\nto resolve possible acceleration to frictionless speed, as\nobserved on Whillans Ice Stream (Bindschadler and others,\n2003a, b).\nFig. 1. Site map showing Rutford Ice Stream flowing into the Ronne\nIce Shelf and the neighbouring Carlson Inlet. The five GPS antennas\nwere located \u000240 km upstream from the grounding line, and the\nreference station is 31 km from the GPS array. The left inset shows\nthe geometry of the measurement array. Diamonds indicate the\ngeographic location of the GPS receivers, filled circles the passive\nseismic receivers that ran throughout the period shown in Figure 4\nand open circles the ones that ran during only the first part of the\nexperiment. The seismic and GPS receivers were not run simul-\ntaneously (see text for details).\nFig. 2. An example of the computed path of antenna D during\n1 hour. Ice flow is from top to bottom.

Passive seismic array\nDespite considerable effort, no relevant passive seismic data\nwere recorded during the GPS work in the 2004\/05 field\nseason. However, a network of passive seismic stations was\ndeployed in the same area during December 1997 (Smith,\n2006), and some aspects of those data will be considered\nalongside the new GPS results. Ten recording stations were\nestablished on the ice stream (Fig. 1) and maintained for\n13 days. Following a 3 day break in recording, a five-station\nsubset of the first array operated for a further 7 days. Seismic\nenergy at each station was detected by three-component\ngeophones (20Hz natural frequency) and sampled at 2ms\nintervals. Events in which the signal on the vertical channel\nrose sufficiently above a continuously monitored back-\nground level were recorded on Reftek data acquisition\nsystem (DAS) data loggers. This triggering algorithm will\npresumably fail to record the smallest seismic events, but\nbackground noise levels in the area are very low and hence\nthe result should give a good relative indication of levels of\nseismicity over the array.\n3. GPS DATA PROCESSING\nThe GPS reference station, which was located in the Ells-\nworth Mountains (Fig. 1), 31 km away and 894m above the\nfield site, allowed a relative processing procedure to be\nused. The position of the reference station was determined\nusing the Precise Point Positioning (PPP) approach imple-\nmented in the GIPSY\/OASIS II software (Zumberge and\nothers, 1997). To ensure that systematic errors were not\nintroduced during the data processing, rigorous processing\nstrategies were adopted (King, 2004). The differential-phase\nkinematic positioning program, TRACK (part of the GAMIT\nsoftware package (R.W. King and Y. Bock, unpublished\ninformation)), was used to process the continuous GPS data\non the ice stream relative to the base station. The motion of\neach antenna was modelled as a random walk, with a\nconstraint on the epoch-to-epoch motion set to 5\u201310mm.\nGPS formal errors are generally over-optimistic, and hence\nwe compute the uncertainties by examining the detrended\ncoordinate time series computed between the base station\nand another linearly moving site \u000280 km away on the other\nside of Rutford Ice Stream. The root-mean-square of this time\nseries suggests a precision of better than 1 cm (horizontal)\nand 3 cm (vertical). Given that this baseline is longer than\nthe baselines to Rutford Ice Stream, we therefore expect the\ncoordinate precisions of the velocity stakes to be better\nthan 1 and 3 cm in the horizontal and vertical components,\nrespectively. Visual inspection of the horizontal-position\ntime series confirms this. An example of horizontal move-\nment of stake D over 1 hour is shown in Figure 2.\nInspection of the horizontal movement of all the stakes\nduring the whole period (at 10 s measurement resolution)\nreveals that the motion is smooth, with no sign of stick\u2013slip\nbehaviour.\nThe average horizontal velocity of each antenna was\ncomputed by linear least squares, fitting a line through the\nantenna path. The resulting values are presented in Table 1.\nThe flow velocity increases in the downstream direction and\nalso southwest across the ice stream.\nThe coordinate system for each antenna was then rotated\nto have the x axis along the mean flow direction, and the\ntime series of position was then detrended by subtracting\nthe mean linear motion. Neither the surface elevation nor\nthe lateral horizontal movement (i.e. perpendicular to the\nmean flow direction) shows anything other than smooth\nmotion during the recording period. In contrast, the\ndetrended, along-flow horizontal motion (Fig. 3) shows\nclear, periodic flow variations: a dominant fortnightly vari-\nation, with diurnal and semi-diurnal frequencies super-\nimposed upon it. This flow variation is analogous to similar\nGPS data of horizontal along-flow positions from Rutford Ice\nStream that were collected at the grounding line, 10, 20 and\n40 km upstream from the grounding line (Gudmundsson,\n2006). The new data therefore confirm that tides have a\npersistent influence on the flow of the ice stream at least as\nfar as 40 km upstream from the grounding line. Below we\nanalyze a high-resolution velocity time series derived from\nthese along-flow horizontal motion records.\n4. PASSIVE SEISMIC DATA\nThe characteristics and interpretation of the passive seismic\ndata were presented in detail by Smith (2006), including\nTable 1.

In sum-\nmary, events from the bed were identified from waveform\ncharacteristics (Blankenship and others, 1987; Ananda-\nkrishnan and Bentley, 1993) and from the difference in their\nP- and S-wave travel times, knowing the ice thickness from\nseismic reflection surveys and typical seismic velocities in\nice (\u00023600\u20133900m s\u20131 for P waves and \u00021700\u20131950m s\u20131\nfor S waves). For each bed event, this difference in travel\ntimes was consistent with P and S waves originating from a\nsingle event at the ice-stream bed. Events from all other\norigins were discarded. No bed events could be identified at\nmore than one recording station, and the maximum\nobserved difference in P- and S-wave travel times indicated\na source with an epicentral distance of no greater than 1 km\nfrom the recording station. Hence, the bed events are low-\nenergy and each station was sensitive only to those occur-\nring within an epicentral radius of \u00021 km. This means that all\nthe basal events detected at a given recording station origin-\nate within a relatively small area of the bed (radius 1 km)\ncentred directly beneath that station. The hourly mean\nnumber of basal events was calculated across the whole\narray (Fig. 4). The seismic events from the ice-stream bed all\nhave similar amplitudes (Smith, 2006), and hence, although\nthe coarse sample rate (2ms) precludes a rigorous quantita-\ntive analysis of wavelet energies, the number of events\ndetected is still a reasonable indication of the relative levels\nof elastic energy being released at the bed.\nMean basal seismicity across the array (Fig. 4) shows\nactive periods of a few hours, separated by inactive periods of\nbetween 1 hour and 1 day. Basal seismicity varies across the\narray (Smith, 2006), so the reduced number of stations from\n15 December 1997 onwards (five rather than ten) means the\nbasal seismicity magnitude cannot necessarily be compared\ndirectly between the two recording periods in Figure 4.\nHowever, although the level of seismicity varies, the timing\nof any relatively active and inactive periods of basal\nseismicity should be largely independent of the number of\nstations or their locations. Hence, we concentrate primarily\nFig. 3. The detrended inline position of the five antennas showing the fortnightly flow variability of the ice stream.

TIDAL RECORD AT THE GROUNDING LINE\nTo allow an assessment of the influence of ocean tides on the\nobserved ice-stream velocity and basal seismicity variations,\nwe generated tidal predictions of the surface elevation a\nshort distance downstream of the grounding line, where the\nice-shelf vertical displacement is driven by tides in the ocean\nbeneath. The highest tidal amplitudes around Antarctica are\nfound in the southern Filchner\u2013Ronne Ice Shelf area, south of\nHenry and Korff ice rises. The spring-tide peak-to-peak range\nexceeds 7m in the mouth of Rutford Ice Stream, and the\nmajor semi-diurnal constituents M2 and S2 dominate tidal\nrecords (Stephenson, 1984; Doake, 1992; Padman and\nothers, 2002). A 56 day GPS data series of the vertical\nmotion close to the grounding line (personal communication\nfrom G.H. Gudmundsson, 2005) has been analyzed with\nstandard tidal analysis methods using the T-TIDE software\npackage (Pawlowicz and others, 2002). The four main\nconstituents are the O1 and K1 (diurnal) and M2 and S2\n(semi-diurnal) constituents. Two other constituents are sig-\nnificant, Q1 and N2, and two constituents, K2 and P1, were\ninferred from S2 and K1, respectively (Pugh, 1987), using\namplitude and phase relationships from the CATS02.01 tide\nmodel for Antarctic ice shelves and seas (Padman and others,\n2002). The amplitude and phase of fortnightly and monthly\ntidal constituents could not be resolved from the original\nGPS record, so these were also obtained from the CATS02.01\ntide model. Tidal predictions for the periods of the GPS and\npassive seismic experiments were constructed from these ten\nconstituents. The resulting tidal prediction for the period of\nthe GPS experiment is shown in Figure 5a.\n6. GPS-DATA VELOCITY ANALYSIS\n6.1. Velocity variations\nThe along-flow horizontal position records (Fig. 3) as well as\nthe results of Gudmundsson (2006) and Murray and others\n(2007) show that the velocity of Rutford Ice Stream is modu-\nlated by the ocean tides at the grounding line. We investi-\ngated the influence of tides by considering antenna velocity\nvalues, computed from the position data. The position data\nhave a high temporal resolution (10 s) and the details of each\nantenna path will include a mixture of noise associated with\nthe receiver and the data processing, wind-induced antenna\nfluctuations and real ice-flow variations. It was therefore\nnecessary to filter any high-frequency signal. The following\nprocedure was used to derive the antenna velocities.\nFig. 5. (a) Tidal signal constructed with eight diurnal and semi-diurnal constituents and the lunar fortnightly and monthly (Mf and Mm)\nconstituents for the period when the GPS measurements on Rutford Ice Stream were obtained. (b) The velocity variation from the mean\nvelocity computed from the positions shown in Figure 3 as explained in the text. Top to bottom: U, NE, C, SW, D. For clarity, curves for NE\nand SW are shifted +150 and \u2013150ma\u20131, respectively, and curves for U and D are shifted +300 and \u2013300ma\u20131. The inset in the bottom left\ncorner shows the computed velocity of SW during 10 January 2005, the same period as shown in the inset of Figure 3.\nA\u00f0algeirsdo\u00b4ttir and others: Tidal influence on Rutford Ice Stream 719\nFirst, occasional data gaps were filled with values of a\npolynomial curve of degree 20, which was fitted through the\ndata. This process does not add to the high-frequency signal,\nnor should it distort the fortnightly variation in the velocity.\nThe records of receiver position were then filtered using a\nlow-pass, finite impulse response (FIR) filter, with a cut-off\nfrequency of 20min, and resampled every 10 min. The\nvelocity was then computed with a five-point numerical\ndifferentiation. The resulting velocity was finally filtered\nfurther with a 13-point running average, which is equivalent\nto low-pass filtering with a 2 hour cut-off frequency. This\nkept the decimation rate of the velocity records at 10min.\nThe resulting velocity variation from the mean of all five\nstakes is shown in Figure 5b. The consistency of the results\nwas tested by predicting the antenna positions using the\ncomputed velocities and comparing these with the meas-\nured position. Excellent agreement was found between the\ntwo datasets (the final position of each of the antennas was\nwithin 2% of the total movement over the period of\n34.5 days). The error in the velocity is estimated to be\n10ma\u20131, which is \u00023% of the mean velocity. The total\nvariance of the velocity, in terms of standard deviation from\nthe mean velocity, is shown in Table 1. The largest variance\nis at D, and it decreases upstream.\n6.2. Frequency analysis\nThe along-flow, horizontal velocity time series for all five\nstations (Fig. 5) were analyzed using fast Fourier transform\n(FFT) to indicate all the significant frequencies present in the\ndata. All the power spectra were broadly similar, with by far\nthe largest component at \u00020.067 cycles d\u20131 (15 day period),\ntwo major modes at 1 cycle d\u20131, two at 2 cycles d\u20131 and\nsmaller peaks at 3 and 4 cycles d\u20131. In addition, the records\nat stations C, SW and D have a significant frequency peak at\n8 cycles d\u20131.\n6.3. Harmonic analysis for tidal species\nThe general frequency analysis described above indicates\nthat the GPS data are dominated by signals with typical\nocean-tide frequency values. Hence, to allow a more rigor-\nous comparison between the GPS data and the tidal record\nfrom the ice shelf, the GPS velocity records were analyzed\nspecifically for the semi-diurnal, diurnal and fortnightly\nconstituents present in the ice-shelf record using the T-TIDE\nsoftware package (Pawlowicz and others, 2002). The data-\nsets are too short to include the longer-period components\nsuch as monthly, semi-annual and annual, although analysis\nof a longer time series at this location demonstrates that\nthese components are present (Murray and others, 2007).\nFor consistency, the tidal prediction was also analyzed in the\nsame way. Although the constituents used to generate the\nprediction are known, this approach means that uncertain-\nties due to the limited record lengths, particularly in the\nlonger-period constituents, should be similar for both the\nGPS velocity analysis and that of the tidal prediction. This\nallows a rigorous comparison to be made between the two\ndatasets. It also gives some assessment of the proportion of\nthe GPS record that can be explained by the anticipated\nocean forcing, and how much must be attributed to other\nmechanisms, or to unresolved tidal components.\nTwo fortnightly constituents were specified in the har-\nmonic analysis: MSf (14.76 day period), the lunisolar\nsynodic fortnightly constituent; and Mf, the lunar fortnightly\nconstituent (period 13.66 days). The main frequency in the\nobserved time series is closer to 15 days. Globally, Mf is\ntypically the dominant fortnightly constituent, due to direct\ngravitational forcing. However, due to non-linear interaction\nbetween M2 and S2 in shallow water (Pugh, 1987), MSf may\nbe the dominant fortnightly term around much of Antarctica,\nparticularly in the sub-ice-shelf regions. There are, at\npresent, too few GPS or tilt data on the Ronne Ice Shelf\nnear the grounding zone to separate Mf and MSf reliably and\nhence determine their respective magnitudes.\nThree separate harmonic analyses were done using dif-\nferent fortnightly components: with MSf only, with Mf only\nand finally with both. The best result (giving the highest\nsignal-to-noise ratio) was obtained when both constituents\nwere used in the analysis. In this case, MSf was about two\ntimes larger in amplitude than Mf. The length of our velocity\nrecord is, however, only two fortnightly cycles, which is\nrather short to determine fortnightly characteristics accur-\nately. Similar analysis of a 2 year velocity record nearby\n(Murray and others, 2007) showed an amplitude of MSf\nabout five times larger than Mf. Adding the two fortnightly\ncomponents in our analysis gives the total contribution at the\nperiod, which is \u000210\u201312% of the total velocity. This is in\ngood agreement with similar data from Gudmundsson\n(2006), who analyzed the in-line position.\nThe harmonic analysis shows that the semi-diurnal, diur-\nnal and the two fortnightly tidal components can account for\nup to 86% of the variance in the observed velocity record\n(Table 1). The remaining variance is due to limitations of this\nanalysis due to the short length of the record, to other tides\n(including higher and lower frequencies) and noise and\/or\npotential non-tidal contributions. The amplitudes of the\nconstituents at each station are plotted against the corres-\nponding constituent in the ice-shelf tidal signal in Figure 6,\nand the amplitudes of the six largest constituents are given in\nTable 1. The amplitude at fortnightly periods decreases\nupstream, with the amplitude at D and C of similar value but\nlower at U. The semi-diurnal constituents (M2, S2 and K2)\nhave larger amplitudes than the diurnal ones, \u00024\u201312% of\nthe total velocity. The diurnal components (O1, P1 and K1)\nhave \u00023\u20135% amplitude compared to the total velocity. The\nestimates for the phase of each constituent have too high an\nerror for conclusions to be drawn about the change in phase\nacross or along the ice stream over the stake array.\nFig. 6. The amplitude of each tidal component of the velocity\nrecords on the ice stream plotted against the corresponding\namplitude on the ice shelf. Formal errors are shown as error bars\nat the 95% confidence level.\nA\u00f0algeirsdo\u00b4ttir and others: Tidal influence on Rutford Ice Stream720\nFigure 6 shows that for constituents with small amplitude\non the ice shelf (Q1, P1, N2 and K2), the ice-stream re-\nsponse is smaller than for those of larger amplitude (O1, K1,\nS2 and M2). Three further details of Figure 6 are also worth\nnoting:\n1. The response of the ice stream at the fortnightly periods is\ndominant, despite the relatively small vertical tidal\nforcing of that period on the ice shelf.\n2. For the two largest constituents in the ice-shelf signal\n(semi-diurnal S2 and M2) the response of the ice stream\nis of similar magnitude, even though the amplitude of\nM2 is more than 1.5 times that of S2 on the ice shelf.\n3. For most tidal frequencies, the errors in the harmonic\nanalysis of the velocity data are such that the ice-stream\nresponse at each station cannot be claimed to differ\nsignificantly from that at any other site.\nThese observations have a number of implications. In the\ncase of the fortnightly periods, which have a small amplitude\non the ice shelf, the ice stream cannot solely be responding\nto that forcing but rather to the tidal range, which also has a\nperiod of \u000215 days (two per lunar month of 29.5 days, or\n14.75 days). Compare Figure 5a and b and observe that the\nvelocity is high when the tidal range is large and low when\nthe tidal range is smaller. Both autocorrelation of each of the\nvelocity series, which indicates a periodicity of 15 days, and\npower spectra of FFT analysis, which shows by far the most\nenergy in the 15 day period, support this. The second\nobservation indicates that the amplitude of the forcing at the\nice shelf is not the only factor controlling the ice-stream\nresponse. This has also been observed for the longer than\nfortnightly periods; semi-annual response of the ice stream\ndoes not scale with the forcing on the ice shelf (Murray and\nothers, 2007). The third observation indicates that no\nsignificant difference in the ice-stream response to ocean\ntide forcing can be detected across an array of these\ndimensions (6 km\u0004 6 km) using the data acquisition, proces-\nsing and harmonic analysis approaches we have employed.\n6.4. Time delay and strain rates over the array\nCross-correlation between the different position records (at\n10 s measurement resolution; Fig. 3) shows there is a time\nlag of 5\u0003 2min between C and U, a similar time lag\nbetween D and U, and no discernible time lag across the\nglacier. This indicates that over the array there are changes in\nthe propagation of the tidal modulation in the flow direction,\nbut only between the furthest upstream site and the rest of\nthe array. The modulation arrives simultaneously at D, SW, C\nand NE, but 5min later at U, indicating a propagation\nvelocity of \u000210\u00034m s\u20131 between U and the lower part of\nthe grid which is moving synchronously. This is about an\norder of magnitude larger than Gudmundsson (2006) found\nby measuring phase changes between stations located at the\ngrounding line, and 10, 20 and 40 km upstream from the\ngrounding line, which indicated a propagation velocity of\n1\u20132m s\u20131. It is therefore likely that the propagation velocity\nis variable along the ice stream. Some areas appear to delay\nthe signal less than other areas, such as the lower part of the\nmeasurement array.\nThe change in separation between stations NE and SW\nover the entire record is larger than between U and D. Over\nthe period of observations, SW and C move apart by\n74.5 cm, C and NE by 54.2 cm, U and C by 3.7 cm and C\nand D by 14.6 cm. The distance between the stations is\n\u00023 km. This indicates extending flow in both horizontal\ndirections, along and across the ice stream, with approxi-\nmate strain rates of 0.00032 and 0.0023 a\u20131, respectively.\nThese values are similar to those measured previously in this\narea (e.g. Frolich and others, 1987).\n7. TIDAL CORRELATION WITH SURFACE VELOCITY\nAND BASAL SEISMICITY\nTo compare the ice-flow variability and basal seismicity with\nthe tidal record at the ice shelf, the time series were plotted\ntogether (Fig. 7). The ocean tide record is presented as the\nmagnitude of the deviation from mean tide height (negative\nvalues of the ocean tide record (low tides in Fig. 5a) are\ndrawn as positive values with a grey curve). It must be kept\nin mind that the tidal record is based on analysis of data\nfrom a different period and is not error-free. An example of\nthe velocity record from one station during a 12 day period\nfrom spring tide to neap tide, as well as the first part of the\nseismic record on the same timescale are shown in Figure 7.\nIt should also be kept in mind that the velocity perturbation\npropagates upstream with a velocity that can be variable\nalong the ice stream. The cross-correlation of the position\nrecords indicates a propagation velocity of 10\u00034m s\u20131,\nwhich would separate the velocity and the tidal signal by\n0.8\u20131.8 hours over the 40 km distance between the ground-\ning line (assumed to be the location of the forcing) and the\nlocation of the measurements. Similar measurements over a\nlarger area of the ice stream, from the grounding line to the\nmeasurement site, by Gudmundsson (2006) indicate a\npropagation velocity in the range 1\u20132m s\u20131, which separates\nthe two records by 5\u201311 hours. The unknown separation of\nthe records in Figure 7 makes it impossible to be certain\nwhether a velocity or seismic peak occurs at high, falling,\nlow or rising tide. However, comparing the two records\nwithout separation gives information about the occurrence\nof velocity or seismic peaks at equivalent times within the\ntidal cycle, as the separation can be assumed to be the same\nthroughout the records.\nInspection of the entire record for all five stations, as well\nas the seismic record, reveals that there is no simple\nrelationship between the ocean tide and the velocity and\nbasal seismicity of the ice stream. In the velocity record\nthere is, however, a distinct pattern visible, which is\ncharacterized by two velocity peaks during one tidal cycle\n(61\u201372% of the tidal cycles have two velocity peaks). During\nabout a third of the observed tidal cycles, there were three\nvelocity peaks. For the basal seismicity record there are\nsimilarly two peaks in seismicity during 67% of the tidal\ncycles. The variability in seismic activity is larger than that in\nthe velocity record.\nDividing the semi-diurnal tidal cycle into four equally\nlong parts and counting the occurrence of peaks within each\npart gives information about relative timing of velocity or\nseismicity peaks within the tidal cycle. For the velocity\nrecord, simple peak counting reveals that about three-\nquarters (68\u201383%) of the first part of the tidal cycle coincides\nwith velocity peaks, there are velocity peaks in 29\u201349% of\nthe next part, 55\u201364% of the third part and 9\u201317% of the last\npart (the percentage ranges represent the values from the five\nstations). The five stations do not have the same response\n(e.g. the occurrence of three velocity peaks or a missing\ndouble peak does not happen concurrently at all sites). The\nA\u00f0algeirsdo\u00b4ttir and others: Tidal influence on Rutford Ice Stream 721\nexceptions to the general behaviour (missing a double peak\nor three velocity peaks) occur randomly over the array, with\nmore exceptions during neap tide than spring tide. The\npattern between the velocity and the tidal record at the ice\nshelf is stronger during spring tide than neap tide. Similar\ncounting of peaks in seismic activity within the four equally\nlong parts of the tidal cycle shows that during 35 tidal cycles\nthere are 24 peaks in the first part, 11 in the second, 24 in\nthe third and 4 in the fourth part. The record of basal\nseismicity is not long enough, nor sufficiently complete, to\ndetermine with certainty whether the level of basal seis-\nmicity is greater during periods of spring tides. However, we\nnote that the correlation with tides is still seen on some\noccasions during neap tide periods, as shown in the velocity\nrecord. Longer seismic records would be required to\ninvestigate this further.\nThe comparison of the velocity and seismic records with\nthe tidal record at the ice shelf shows that both velocity and\nseismicity increase at the same time within the tidal cycle.\nThe first and third parts of the semi-diurnal tidal cycle have\nhighest velocity and seismicity, and the fourth part the\nlowest. The timing is, however, not precise, as can be seen in\nFigure 7.\n8. DISCUSSION\nThe observed flow of Rutford Ice Stream is strongly affected\nby the tides downstream of the measurement site. The fourth\nrow in Table 1 shows that the semi-diurnal, diurnal and\nfortnightly ocean tides can account for up to 86% of the\nvelocity variations evident in the GPS data. Comparison of\nrows three and four in Table 1 shows that the largest\nvariation in velocity is at D and this decreases upstream, but\nthe tidal components can explain the largest percentage of\nthe variance in the velocity at U. This indicates that\ncontributions of noise, non-tidal disturbance and higher or\nlower tidal periods to the total velocity variance are not\nconstant between the sites. The unexplained variance may\nwell be the result of a combination of factors. Longer-period\n(e.g. monthly, semi-annual and annual) tidal components\nhave been observed in a similar velocity record from the\nsame location (Murray and others, 2007), but the records\npresented here are too short to analyze for them, and non-\nlinear forcing at grounding lines can lead to significant\nhigher-frequency signals (Pedley and others, 1986), for\nwhich we have also not analyzed.\nThe analysis of the 6week high-resolution and con-\ntinuous-velocity records during the 2004\/05 austral summer\nconfirms the conclusion of Murray and others (2007) that the\nmagnitude of the downstream velocity response at each\nfrequency does not scale linearly with the amplitude of the\ncorresponding vertical tidal forcing. Even though the\nmeasurements are made during solstice when the ice flow\nis slowest and the semi-diurnal variation is smallest (Murray\nand others, 2007), there are two or three velocity peaks\nobserved during each tidal cycle.\nThe analysis of the velocity and seismic records from\nRutford Ice Stream reveals some similarities and some\ndifferences between this ice stream and the Siple Coast ice\nstreams. The position records, which have high temporal\nresolution (10 s), exclude any stick\u2013slip motion on Rutford\nIce Stream. Increased velocity is observed during all parts of\nthe tidal cycle, and therefore also during some of the falling\ntides, indicating that the same effect as on Bindschadler Ice\nStream is acting (Anandakrishnan and others, 2003). In\ncontrast to observations on Kamb Ice Stream, where there is\nanticorrelation between basal seismicity and mean flow\nspeed and, on shorter timescales, correlation of basal\nseismicity and low tide on the ice shelf (Anandakrishnan\nand Alley, 1997a, b), we observe basal seismicity correlating\nFig. 7. (a) An example 12 day velocity record from C, drawn together with the modelled tidal record on the ice shelf. (b) The mean basal\nseismicity (events per hour) plotted on top of the modelled tidal record on the ice shelf. Only the first 12 days, while ten receivers were\nrunning, are shown. The predicted tidal record in both panels is shown as positive deviation from the mean. The high tide is plotted with a\nthick black curve, the low tide with a grey curve.\nA\u00f0algeirsdo\u00b4ttir and others: Tidal influence on Rutford Ice Stream722\nwith velocity and highest seismic activity during spring tide\nwhen the velocity is highest.\nRather than attempting to model all the different\nmechanisms that appear to be interacting simultaneously\non Rutford Ice Stream, we make the following list which can\ncontribute to the understanding of the transfer of the tidal\nforce at the ice shelf to the flow of the ice stream, in\nparticular, the increase in both velocity and seismic activity\ntwo (and sometimes three) times during each tidal cycle.\nThe tide level, which can vary up to 7m during spring\ntide, changes the force balance in the grounding zone.\nThomas (2007) proposes a simple force-perturbation\nmodel, which includes balance between the compres-\nsive force, resisting forces due to basal drag and marginal\nshear, and back forces caused by the depth of the sea and\nthe ice shelf. In this model, ice-stream acceleration is\nfavoured by low tides, but velocity changes are damped\nby changes in ice-shelf back pressure which are likely to\nfavour acceleration at falling tide. The response is likely\nto be scaled by the amplitude of the tidal range.\nMelting near the grounding line (Smith, 1996) may have\nan effect on the pressure in the subglacial drainage\nsystem and thereby basal motion. This mechanism could\nhappen at tidal frequencies as warmer water is trans-\nported to the grounding line by tidal currents, and would\nnot necessarily scale with tidal amplitude.\nThe tidal elevation itself may influence the basal shear\nstress and therefore affect the ice-stream motion. A\nmodel taking this effect into account has been shown to\nreproduce the fortnightly variation in in-line position\n(Gudmundsson, 2007). Reduced basal friction resulting\nfrom perturbations in basal shear stress may lead to\nreduced seismicity at high tide.\nDoake and others (2002) considered the frictional drag of\nocean currents on the underside of an ice shelf and the\npossibility for this to push and pull the ice at tidal\nfequencies. They concluded, however, that very high\nice\u2013water friction coefficients would be required for this\nmechanism to be significant. Also, although the sea-bed\nbathymetry near the grounding line of Rutford Ice Stream\ncould well cause the ocean currents there to be complex,\nthe overall ebb and flow of the tides is unlikely to\ngenerate the higher frequency responses (two and three\nper tide) that we observe in flow and seismicity.\nTherefore, it seems unlikely that this mechanism can\nexplain our data.\nDue to the pinning point in the centre of the grounding\nline, the rising and falling ice shelf may cause the ice\nstream to be partially ungrounded in areas upstream of\nthe pinning point at low tide, as has been observed at\nEkstro\u00a8misen (Heinert and Riedel, 2007), reducing the\nbasal resistive stress and increasing the velocity. De-\npending on how close the ice stream is to flotation in this\narea, this mechanism may or may not scale with the\namplitude of the tide.\n9. CONCLUSION\nDuring the austral summer, Rutford Ice Stream flows at a\nspeed of \u0002370ma\u20131 (367\u2013380ma\u20131), 40 km upstream from\nthe grounding line. Comparison between five velocity time\nseries and the passive seismic record and the tidal record\nindicates a complicated response to the tidal forcing. Both\nthe surface velocity and basal seismicity show two peaks,\nand sometimes three, during a tidal cycle, indicating that\nocean tides at the grounding line modulate the ice-stream\nflow. The transfer of the ocean forcing up the ice stream is\ncomplicated and the effects of irregular grounding zone\nwith areas of partial grounding (Rignot, 1998) and both\nspatially and temporally variable basal conditions (Smith,\n1997a, b; Smith and others, 2007) contribute to the com-\nplexity. The variation in the velocity with fortnightly period\nhas an amplitude of \u000210\u201312% of the total velocity, but at\ndiurnal and semi-diurnal period the variation amplitude is\n3\u20135% and 4\u201312%, respectively. We summarize our obser-\nvations as follows:\nThe flow is smooth, with no evidence of any stick\u2013slip\nbehaviour. The release of seismic energy is, however, not\nsmooth, with variable levels of activity.\nBoth the velocity and the level of basal seismicity show\nincreases that occur two times, sometimes three times,\nduring each tidal cycle. The correlations are stronger\nduring spring tide periods than neap tide.\nIncrease in velocity and basal seismicity correlates and\noccurs most frequently at equivalent times within the\ntidal cycle. The pattern is, however, not always consist-\nent, indicating a complicated response of the ice stream\nto tidal forcing.\nThe amplitude of the ice-stream response at each tidal\nperiod does not scale with the corresponding forcing on\nthe ice shelf.\nThere is little variation across the measurement array; the\nonly significant difference detected was a 5min phase\nlag between the upstream station (U) and the rest of the\narray. This suggests a variable propagation velocity along\nthe ice stream.\nThese observations suggest that numerous mechanisms are\nacting simultaneously. It is clear that the ice stream is\nsensitive to sea-level variations, at least at tidal frequencies.\nThis sensitivity could have global implications, as the\nobserved sea-level rise could be accelerated by increased\nice-stream discharge.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis project was funded by the UK National Environmental\nResearch Council (NERC) Antarctic Funding Initiative (AFI)\n(GR3\/G005), the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and NASA.\nField support was provided by BAS.
