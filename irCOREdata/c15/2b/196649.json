Whilst this is certainly true with regards to the present day, it in no way follows \nthat figurational sociology seeks to distance itself from politics as such. On the \ncontrary, as will be shown within this paper, politics is and always has been a central \nconcern for figurational sociologists. This political concern, however, is an \nexclusively long term concern; figurational sociology purposively postpones present \npolitical engagement for the sake of developing a sufficiently detached sociology that \nwould eventually facilitate in the delivery of effective practical and political measures. \nThis paper discusses the stakes involved in, as well as the reasoning behind, the \nassignment of such a place to politics. It gestures towards two distinct and separate \nconcepts of social control that exist within figurational sociology and then proceeds to \noffer a critical consideration of the consequences that can be derived from any \ntemporal demarcation of the political done on their basis. The paper ultimately \nsuggests that figurational sociology\u2019s position on politics raises a series of as yet \nunanswered questions, questions which can no longer remain unanswered by the \ncontemporary figurational sociologist.  \n \n \nKey Words: Norbert Elias; figurational sociology; involvement and detachment; \npolitical intervention; social control; social policy; public intellectual  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  2 \nFor me, sociology is an undertaking in which the primary task is to help us to \norientate ourselves in this social universe of ours \u2013 to orientate ourselves better \nthan we are able to do now, and accordingly to act less blindly\u2026I think we \nmust be strictly scholarly, of course, but always with the knowledge that a \nsociologist has the hard task of helping to orientate ourselves in the unknown \nsocial universe which we form with each other (Elias 1998: 144). \n \nMy ethos is, that we have to see the world in all its ugliness, as it is without \ndisguises. Then we can perhaps make a better world of it, but only if we know \nhow the world really is, not if we conceal it from ourselves (Elias, c.f. \nFeatherstone 1987: 209). \n \nThere is obviously something very wrong with a scientific discipline if its \nleading representatives allow political sentiment to dominate their scientific \nwork (Elias 1987a: 224). \n \nIntroduction  \n \nTwo of sociology\u2019s characteristic concerns find immensely sophisticated expression \nand expansion within the work of Norbert Elias and his followers: figurational\/ \nprocess sociologists. Firstly: a concern for the appropriate place that is to be given to \nnormative evaluation within sociological investigation. Secondly: a concern for the \nappropriate place that is to be given to sociological investigation with respect to social \npolicy. This paper offers a close but ultimately critical consideration of the manner in \nwhich figurational sociologists have responded to these two concerns. It will be of \nparticular interest to those who are engaged with Elias\u2019 work. And it will be of more \ngeneral interest for anyone concerned with understanding how a great sociologist, and \nlater his followers, have groped around and grappled with such characteristically \nsociological concerns.  \n \nThe paper\u2019s argument develops across this introduction, seven core sections and a \nconclusion. The first of these core sections makes the case for a renewed \n  3 \nconsideration of figurational sociology\u2019s engagement with questions of the political \nby setting this against the background of figurational sociology\u2019s historically \nchequered relationship to the sociological mainstream. The following three sections \nthen discuss and analyse figurational sociology\u2019s complex engagement with questions \nof the political. Within these three sections particular emphasis is placed upon how, \nfor figurational sociology, the very possibility of any sort of social intervention is \nplaced only upon the very distant temporal horizon. That is to say, the politics of \nfigurational sociology, if there are ever to be any, will only ever be found in the long-\nterm. \n \nThe next two sections of the paper then gesture towards an unresolved tension which I \nargue exists both within Elias\u2019s own engagement with the political and also within his \nfollowers\u2019 subsequent defence of this engagement. In this regard, on the one hand \nElias makes a contentious appeal towards an immanent idea of the relationship \nbetween sociology and society. In so doing, Elias describes historically determined \nchains of human interdependencies in terms of their tendency towards restraint and \nsubsequently explains the very manifestation of sociology in terms of this tendency. \nThat being the case, on the other hand, Elias also makes a less conspicuous but \nnonetheless apparent appeal towards sociology as an almost socially transcendent \nforce. In this regard sociology is posited as a figuration of future specialists who will \nknow more than most both about how human interdependencies work and, moreover, \nabout how they can be made to work better. The penultimate section of the paper \nraises a series of questions on the basis of the discontinuity between these two \naccounts of sociology\u2019s relationship with society and with politics. The concluding \n  4 \nsection then calls for more debate around this discontinuity, around these questions, \nand around others like them.  \n \nFigurational Sociology and the Politics of Reception \n \nNorbert Elias and his followers have long sensed the significance, even the urgency, \nof their figurational approach to sociology. As far back as the late 1970s Johan \nGoudsblom, one of the most influential figurational sociologists, took it upon himself \nto re-assess sociological theory as such from the viewpoint of Elias\u2019s ideas (1977a). \nLater, in what remains perhaps the definitive introduction to Eliasian sociology1, \nStephen Mennell argued that Elias\u2019s work \u2018is intended to offer solutions to major \nproblems of sociology and the social sciences more generally\u2019 (1998: 251). More \nrecently still, Stephen Loyal and Stephen Quilley have gone so far as to insist that \n\u2018Eliasian sociology seems best placed to provide a \u2018central theory\u2019 not only for the \nsocial sciences, but for the human sciences more generally\u2019 (2005a: 826). Elias \nhimself concurs on this point when he says: \n \nWe, my friends and I, had to toil and to labour in order to overcome the inertia \nof a process reducing sociology. To keep alive the memory of the not-knowing \nand of the struggle in which new knowledge gained the ascendency is a duty \nwhich must not be shirked. It took almost half a century before process \nsociology found resonance in society at large (1987b: xl). \n \nSomething significant is at stake, therefore. Mennell admits how he \u2018always tended to \nview the promotion of his [Elias\u2019s] ideas as a kind of political campaign\u2019 (2006: 75). \nSo a crucial task for the figurational sociologists of today seems to be that of getting \ntheir message across to the widest possible audience. Mennell is by no means the sole \n  5 \nchampion of such a cause. The hugely significant project of translating Elias\u2019 \ncomplete works into an eighteen volume collection is already bearing fruit (Elias \n2005a, 2005b, 2007a, 2007b, 2007c; see also UCD Press 2008). Extended secondary \ncommentaries and edited collections abound (e.g. Fulbrook 2007; Dunning et. al. \n2006; Loyal and Quilley 2004; van Iterson et. al. 2002; Salumets 2002; Smith 2000; \nDunning 1999; Goudsblom and Mennell 1998; Mennell 1998; van Krieken 1998; \nFletcher 1997; and Dunning and Rojek 1992). A four-volume Masters of Modern \nSocial Thought series has been dedicated to Elias\u2019s work (Dunning and Mennell \n2003)2.  \n \nFigurational sociology, on this cursory reading at least, is being pushed further and \nfurther towards centre stage of the English speaking sociological world. Yet \nfigurational sociology has often been said to be upon this very cusp of centrality: very \noften and not only recently. Over three decades ago, for example, Goudsblom\u2019s \ncomprehensive overview of the reception of Elias\u2019 work was written against the \nbackground of the \u2018intriguing\u2019 (1977b: 38) fact of its then relative obscurity. Over \ntwenty years ago, Dennis Smith proceeded to make the point that \u2018Elias is no longer \nan outsider\u2019 (1984: 386) whilst three years later Mike Featherstone suggested that \nElias\u2019s work \u2018now shows signs of gaining the attention and acknowledgment it has \nlong deserved\u2019 (1987: 197). So if Elias has indeed already become a key name within \nsociology, as seems to have been continuously suggested, one might then wonder \nwhat motivates the contemporary campaign for figurational sociology.   \n \n  6 \nZygmunt Bauman once observed that figurational sociologists are convinced of an \n\u2018astounding contradiction between the profundity of Elias\u2019s work and the shallowness \nof its reception\u2019 (1978: 117). Perhaps this conviction remains prevalent on the part of \nfigurational sociology\u2019s representatives, even to this date. Perhaps the contemporary \ncampaign for figurational sociology seeks to redress the supposed dissonance between \nthe level of reception continuously expected and the level of reception actually \nobserved. Indeeed, speculations as to why the majority of sociologists have been \nrelatively slow on the uptake of Elias\u2019s work are by no means scarce. Richard \nKilminster ultimately identifies \u2018the unavailability in translation of his major works \nfor so long\u2019 (1987: 213-214) as the most decisive factor. Elsewhere Goudsblom \n(1977b: 39) suggests that the manner in which Elias\u2019s work has resonated in different \nways around the world is itself a sociological issue requiring sociological \ninvestigation3.  \n \nIn as much as it has been said that the sociological mainstream has been somewhat \nhesitant or hostile towards an engagement with figurational sociology, even to this \ndate, it has also been said that figurational sociology has at times been guilty of \nresponding in kind. For Johann Arnason, the distinctiveness of the figurational \napproach to sociology can itself \u2018be clarified in terms of a systematic opposition to \ncomponents and variants of a dominant paradigm\u2019 (1987: 431). Similarly Goudsblom \nsuggests that even as far back as Elias\u2019s very early essay on kitsch (1935\/1998) we \nfind expressed certain \u2018features that have characterized Elias\u2019s subsequent writings, \nbeginning with The Civilizing Process. One typical feature was a certain disdain for \n  7 \nscholastic disputation\u2019 (1977b: 75\/1986: 325). Elias, for his part, has attempted to \ndefend his idiosyncratic reluctance to engage with his contemporaries by saying:  \n \nit is more productive for the future of sociology if I go on working in the \nlaboratory as I have done before, like a physicist who would go to his labour \nevery day and do his stint instead of criticizing other physicists (Elias, c.f. \nKilminster 1987: 215).  \n \nSuch a disposition has led many figures towards making the criticism that Elias, and \nlater his followers, tend to make something akin to a straw man of a variety of \nalternative\/competing theoretical sociological positions (e.g. Coser, 1979, Horne and \nJary, 1987 and Layder, 1986), a criticism which Featherstone (1987: 200) says, \u2018has \nan element of truth\u2019. The interchange between Maso (1995b, 1995b), Goudsblom \n(1995) and Kilminster and Wouters (1995), on the subject of the role given to Kantian \nphilosophy within figurational sociology, is truly exemplary in this regard. As Dick \nPels (1991: 179) forcibly remarks, when it comes to figurational sociology:  \n \nIntellectual competition is basically considered a waste of time, and a lowly \noccupation; the defence of tribe and turf is undertaken reluctantly and only if \nprovoked (but then no quarter is given). By this sovereign aloofness, \u2018process \nsociology\u2019, as it prefers to be called, thus effectively reduces the complexity of \nthe outside intellectual world4. \n \nThis seeming reluctance of figurational sociologists to engage with alternative schools \nof sociological thought is no doubt also what Eric Dunning and Stephen Mennell have \nin mind when they argue: \n \nA recurrent criticism of Elias and his \u2018school\u2019 over the years has been that we \nare, in effect, a \u2018sect\u2019 and that we \u2018celebrate\u2019 and \u2018worship\u2019 Elias, a \ncharismatic figure, and his work, rather than criticising and testing it. There \nmay, of course, be some \u2018Eliasians\u2019 whose behaviour is something sect-like in \n  8 \nthis way just as there are sect-like Marxists, Parsonians and Foucauldians. \nHowever, we suspect that this sort of criticism stems at least in part from the \nrefusal of \u2018core Elisians\u2019 to accept manifestly false interpretations of Elias \nsuch as that he was an \u2018evolutionary\u2019 or \u2018progress\u2019 theorist. (2003: xxxii) \n[Emphasis added] \n \nThe tendency of figurational sociologists to point towards and undermine such \nmanifestly false interpretations of Elias (e.g. Dunning and Mennell 1979; Dunning \n1992; Dunning 1989; Dunning 1996; Mennell and Goudsblom 1997; Dunning and \nMennell 1998; Mennell 1998: 227-250; Loyal and Quilley 2005b) surely informs the \nnotion that an Eliasian \u2018sect\u2019 exists. Nevertheless, that there is a campaign seeking to \npromote Elias\u2019s work is not and cannot be understood as a deficiency of the work \nitself. Too often, the idea that there is an Eliasian \u2018sect\u2019 gets in the way of the ideas \nthemselves, thereby blocking sympathetic and systematic access to them. There is, in \nother words, always something quite trivial about every single \u2018are you\/we for or \nagainst the ideas of theorist x?\u2019 discussion. In this respect both Dennis Layder (1994: \n115) and Nico Mouzelis (1993) advocate the bypassing of such superficial tit-for-tat-\nism in favour of analysing how Elias\u2019s work is both connected to and disconnected \nfrom the sociological canon. This means that attention should be paid not so much \ntowards the sociologists as towards the sociology, not towards the sociology of \nfigurational sociolo-gists (in the sense of what brought and keeps them together) but \ntowards the sociology of figurational sociolo-gy (in the sense of the work bearing that \nname). \n \nFollowing such a lead, this paper discusses a compelling tension that I argue exists \nwithin Elias\u2019s work. I do this by interrogating the manner in which some of the \nprinciples it lays down stand as the greatest barriers to that which it otherwise seeks to \n  9 \nachieve. The intention here, to be clear, is neither to \u2018promote\u2019 nor \u2018refute\u2019 \nfigurational sociology. Instead, I will follow both Alan Sica\u2019s suggestion that Elias \ncan be overcome only after his work has been sufficiently engaged (1984) and Johann \nArnason\u2019s (1987: 429) demonstration of how one might argue \u2018with Elias against \nElias\u2019. In so doing, I intend to work with figurational sociology upon its own terms, as \nit were, in order to develop some of the consequences of these. In particular, it will be \nmy central contention that figurational sociology denies itself the very thing which it \nhopes to eventually achieve \u2013 a sociology that would one day help to bring social \nprocesses under more conscious control (Elias 2000: xiv).  \n \nThis is not to leave the opening theme of the politics of figurational sociology\u2019s \nreception behind, however. The discussion began with the theme of the politics \nbehind figurational sociology. It continues with an extended discussion of politics \nwithin the writings of figurational sociology. And it concludes by connecting the \nscenario of the former with the consequences derived from the latter. \n \nThe Spiralling Difficulty of Detachment \n \n[I]f social scientists, although using more specialised procedures and a more \ntechnical language, are in the last resort not much less affected in their \napproach to the problems of society by preconceived ideas and ideals, by \npassions and partisan views, than the man in the street, are they really justified \nin calling themselves scientists?...Can social scientists make any specific \ncontribution to the solution of major problems, even of their own groups, of \ntheir own country, class, profession or whatever it is, if they accept as the self-\nevident foundation of their theories some of the religiously held creeds and \nnorms of one or the other of these groups, so that the results of their studies are \ndestined from the start to agree, or at least not to disagree, with the basic tenets \nof these communal beliefs? (Elias 1987b: 15) \n \n  10 \nIt is clear from the above quotation that Elias wanted social science to be scientific. \nBy this I mean that for Elias, common sense opinions and partisan knowledge claims \nwere the highest hurdles to be jumped on the way towards a properly scientific social \nscience. Chris Rojek argues that such a de-prioritization of the political in the name of \nand for the sake of a scientific sociology \u2018illustrates the main reasons for the mixed \nreaction to Elias\u2019s work\u2019 (1986: 594). Responding to this charge of political quietism, \nEric Dunning explains how the apparently apolitical nature of Elias\u2019s work was itself \na product of his desire to develop a body of sociological knowledge that would give \ndeeper insight into the processual dynamics of political crises (Rojek, 2004: 342-343). \nIt seems that there is, for the time being at least, something of a decision to be made \nbetween the quest for knowledge and the quests of politics. Of course, Elias is by no \nmeans the first figure to comment upon the apparently antagonistic relationship \nbetween value and science, between the moderator and the microscope, between the \nsociologist\u2019s vocation and the sociologist\u2019s own social being. To offer a list of \ntheorists that offer considerations in this regard here would be to trivialize the \nsignificance and specificity of their respective contributions.  Suffice it to say for now \nthat in closing the sociological shop to value trading, Elias falls in line with a long \ntradition of interrogations that attempt to prioritize demonstrations of what is at the \nexpense of elaborations of what ought to be.  \n \nWhat is particularly notable about Elias\u2019s refusal to politically commit figurational \nsociology, therefore, is not so much its consequential would-be claim towards \nheightened object adequacy \u2013 this would hardly be an innovation. What is remarkable \nabout this particular political refrain is its sheer consistency and resolve, unwavering \n  11 \nmost notably in the face of an anti-Semitic Holocaust which dramatically affected \nboth Elias, as an expatriated German Jew, and his family, people who did not exile. \nSuch a momentous event would have driven many scientists to break their moral and \npolitical silence (see especially Elias, 1994). If anything, however, the Holocaust in \nfact only hardened Elias\u2019s scientific resolve, making the need for sociology\u2019s political \ndetachment appear to him as something all the more crucial. In the 1968 postscript to \nThe Civilizing Process, for example, he writes: \n \nIf the present study has any significance at all, this results not least from its \nopposition to this mingling of what is and what ought to be, of scientific \nanalysis with ideals. It points to the possibility of freeing the study of society \nfrom its bondage to social ideologies. This is not to say that an investigation of \nsocial problems which rejects the primacy of political and philosophical ideas \nmeans renouncing the possibility of influencing the course of political events \nthrough the results of sociological research. The opposite is the case. The \nusefulness of sociological research as a tool of social practice is increased if \nthe researcher does not deceive himself by projecting what he desires, what he \nbelieves ought to be, into his investigation of what is and has been. (2000: \n468) \n \nFor Elias sociology could become scientific, indeed it ought to. It ought to become \nscientific because in so doing it could eventually become practical. And it could \neventually become practical only to the extent that social scientists might come to \nprioritize description above prescription. This position, for its part, is consistently and \nunanimously endorsed by Elias\u2019s followers. Herman Korte suggests that Elias\u2019 self-\ndistancing \u2018from current political controversies\u2026serves to give access to a better \nunderstanding of currently existing cultures and civilizing forms of community\u2019 \n(2001: 30) whereas Eric Dunning argues that figurational sociologists \u2018eschew what \none might call the political\/ideological or philosophical \u2018quick fix\u2019, and stress instead \nthe need to carry out theory-guided research\u2019 (1996: 203). Figurational sociology \n  12 \ninsists upon not confounding any political aspirations it may have for actually existing \nempirical events with these actually existing events. It refuses to mis-represent the \nreality of what is by juxtaposing ideas of what ought, or ought not, to be the case. \nElias argues elsewhere that:    \n \nThe sociologist should not be required or expected to express his convictions \nabout how society ought to develop. Sociologists ought rather to free \nthemselves from the notion that there is or even will be any necessary \ncorrespondence between the society they are investigating and their own social \nbeliefs, their wishes and hopes, their moral predilections or their conceptions \nof what is just and humane (1978: 153). \n \nAll of this being the case, the specificity of this particular challenge is heightened by \nthe fact that sociologists participate within the facts they study: they themselves are \norgans of the very body they seek to observe. Elias is fully aware of fact that any \nsociologist, figurational or otherwise, \u2018cannot cease to take part in, and to be affected \nby, the social and political affairs of their groups and their time\u2019 (1987b: 16). Not only \nthat. Elias shows that whenever the political situation within which the sociologist \noperates becomes particularly intense or dangerous, during a war for example, an \nunexamined emotional response will become all the more likely, hence furthermore \njeopardising the accuracy of the account. Elias calls this continuity of oughts a \ndouble-bind: emotional responses spiral out of control, thereby blocking the very \npossibility of the detached stance that would be capable of grounding them to a halt. \nOn this he says: \n \nHigh emotivity of response lessens the chance of a realistic assessment of the \ncritical process and, hence, of a realistic practice in relation to it; relatively \nunrealistic practice under the pressure of strong affects lessens the chance of \nbringing the critical process under control (1987b: 48). \n  13 \nThis observation doesn\u2019t come as some sort of afterthought to Elias\u2019s theory of \nknowledge (most clearly articulated within his Involvement and Detachment); it rather \nacts as a foundation for it. Elias shows how the sociologist is intimately involved \nwithin the very thing they must otherwise eventually detach themselves from. And, as \nwill be shown in the next section of this paper, it is in his discussion of autonomous \nand heteronomous values that Elias attempts to simultaneously overcome both the \nsomewhat positivist notion that sociology should become a \u2018value-free\u2019 science and \nthe avowedly pluralist notion that values, as inevitable, should be worn upon every \nsociological sleeve.  \n \nAcceptable and Unacceptable Values \n \n[E]very scientific endeavor has moral implications. Instead of distinguishing \nbetween two types of science, one of which is \u201cvalue-free\u201d while the other is \nnot, one may find it both simpler and more apposite to distinguish in scientific \npronouncements between two types of evaluations, one autonomous, the other \nheteronomous, of which one or the other may be dominant (Elias, 1956: 229). \n \nThis section explains how the above quotation can be understood as a response to the \ndifficulty of double-bind processes discussed in the previous section. This explanation \nwill in turn lead the way towards a discussion of how Elias argues that sociology \nmight still be considered practically useful, despite the continuously asserted \nrequirement for evaluative detachment.  \n \nAs we have seen, the starting point for much of what Elias says on the place of \nsociological evaluation is that the sociologist is always implicated within a politico-\nsocial situation. Indeed, Elias argues that a sociologists\u2019 own involvement in the \n  14 \nsocial world \u2018is itself one of the conditions for comprehending the problems they try \nto solve as scientists\u2019 (1987b: 16). It is for this reason that he makes a distinction \nbetween autonomous and heteronomous values. Elias\u2019 \u2018autonomous\u2019 values are those \nwhich access, and to a large extent structure, the object(s) with which any field of \nstudy concerns itself (the \u2018value\u2019 of achieving demonstrable observations in the case \nof the human and natural sciences or the \u2018value\u2019 of explaining the evolution of webs \nof human figurations in the case of sociology, for example). This is why Goudsblom \nargues (1977b: 81\/1986: 333) that throughout his work, Elias \n \nis evaluating \u2013 on the basis that the highest professional value for a sociologist \nis to provide more adequate knowledge of the social world, knowledge which \nwill have the practical significance that it will enable us to act more \nrealistically than we do today. This, in Elias\u2019s view, is the central task \nconfronting sociologists: to break out of the confines of short-term, group-\ncentred fantasy thinking, and to discover more realistic means of \norientation\u2026this task should be conceived of not in a definitive, but in a \ndevelopmental sense: as an effort to reduce the fanciful and increase the \nrealistic elements in our thinking about societies. \n \nAs Elias himself puts it within What is Sociology? (1978), investigative fields can be \ndistinguished from one another on the basis of the institutionally legitimated \nautonomous values that they hold as their own. Such values create autonomy on the \npart of a field of investigation. To say that a field has autonomous values is only to \nsay that it has various standards and procedures which its practitioners observe and \nuphold \u2013 there is nothing perversely subjectivist or relativist in any of this. The \nsuccess and strength of an intellectual field, social scientific or otherwise, is hence to \nbe found, for Elias, in its ability to achieve a level of \u2018relative autonomy\u2019 from other \nfields on three ascending levels. Firstly, relative autonomy with respect to the nature \nof its subject matter. Secondly, relative autonomy with respect to the manner in which \n  15 \nthat subject matter is accessed. Finally, relative autonomy with respect to the manner \nin which this relatively autonomous subject matter is institutionally legitimated and \nperpetuated within and across various research programmes and formalised \npedagogies (Elias 1978: 59).  \n \nIn opposition to these autonomous values which go towards constituting the strength \nof a field of enquiry, Elias posits \u2018extra-scientific, heteronomous valuations\u2019 (1987b: \n34-35) which, he argues, are always to the detriment of a field of enquiry insofar as it \nmakes claims towards the value of its enquiries. In order to demonstrate this point, he \nposes the example of a doctor treating an epidemic or fighting cancer. Certainly, the \ndoctor may well feel a profound empathy towards their patients. Indeed, the empathic \nwill to help the sick may well be the primary reason why so many doctors become \ndoctors in the first place. Nevertheless, the ability to treat patients will not come from \nthe doctors\u2019 empathy alone. On the contrary, the very therapeutic ability sought will \nrather come from the doctors\u2019 own ability to detach themselves from emotional \nresponsiveness, thereby more fully involving themselves in the study of the facts of \nthe given illness. Certainly, it is medical science that constitutes these facts as facts. \nBut for Elias, this does not make these facts any less real. As he argues: \n \nWhat we call \u201cscience\u201d is merely an expression of people\u2019s ability to break the \nhold of the double-bind process in their relationships with inanimate nature, to \nlower, at the same time, the fantasy level of their knowledge, the danger level \nof natural events, and thus to put the double-bind process into reverse gear \n(1987b: 98). \n \nThe doctor, in other words, is in the best position to treat the patient when s\/he is \ndetached from any evaluation of the way in which ill people should be (i.e. not ill) and \n  16 \nfocuses instead upon the way in which ill people are (i.e. ill). Sociology, for Elias, has \nyet to achieve such a high level of relative autonomy. For as long as it is continues to \nbe done on the basis of heteronomous values, it will not ever reach such heights. For \nElias, heteronomous values intrude into the very make-up of any science, impeding its \nability to progress and tarnishing its very claim toward scientificity. Sociological \nprogress is only to be had when sociologists become ready and willing to leave their \nmoral ideals and political beliefs outside of their vocation, precisely for the sake of the \nvocation. The temptation for the individual sociologist to politically intervene will \nalways exist. Yet moving forward on the basis of heteronomous values (the wishes of \nthe researcher, their hopes and ideas as to how society should be) is, for Elias and his \nfollowers, more inexcusable still. On the basis of such pseudo-sociology, tyranny and \ndespotism may well take centre stage. With dogma taking the place of observation, \nElias argues that:   \n \nWe end up believing and feeling we actually are what we ought to be and \nwhat we may even want to be. More precisely, we confuse fact with ideal, that \nwhich is with that which ought to be (1978: 118).      \n \nOr as he goes on to say in the same book: \n \nThe sociologist should not be required or expected to express his convictions \nabout how society ought to develop. Sociologists ought rather to free \nthemselves from the notion that there is or even will be any necessary \ncorrespondence between the society they are investigating and their own social \nbeliefs, their wishes and hopes, their moral predilections or their conceptions \nof what is just and humane (1978: 153). \n \nThis means that for Elias, the characteristic question of involvement is what does it \nmean for me or for us? Towards the other extreme, the characteristic question of \n  17 \ndetachment is what is it? (1987b: 6). Historically, Elias argues, the natural sciences \nhave become very successful in gradually achieving the level of detachment necessary \nto prioritize the latter, more detached, form of questioning. That the social sciences \nhave been so unsuccessful in achieving a comparatively sufficient level of detachment \nis a serious problem in the eyes of figurational sociology, perhaps the most serious.  \n \nElias insists that until heteronomous values are sufficiently pacified, it will never be \npossible to put the social sciences to the service of that which they attempt to \nunderstand. Elias\u2019 extended and at times ill-tempered criticism of what he calls \u2018the \nnew deductionists\u2019 proliferating within the social sciences is not only that they are \nwrong to see things otherwise. More seriously, his criticism picks up on the fact that \nthese \u2018new deductionists\u2019 are doubly wrong: they see no problem in allowing \nheteronomous values to take free reign (1984: 217-220). Much in the way that the \ncosmologist is not required to have a view on divinity, although they are fully entitled \ntowards such views, Elias insists that the sociologist must strive to show how society \nworks without expressing how they feel it should work. To quote Elias once more: \n \nThe stronger the hold of involved forms of thinking, and thus of the inability \nto distance oneself from traditional attitudes, the stronger the danger inherent \nin the situation created by peoples traditional attitudes towards each other and \ntowards themselves. The greater the danger the more difficult it is for people \nto look at themselves, at each other and at the whole situation with a measure \nof detachment (1987b: xiv). \n \nFigurational sociology therefore attempts to lift sociology out of various magico-\nmythical structures of thought towards more reality congruent appreciations of the \nworld. The Comteian undertones are intentional. Sociology denies itself the potential \n  18 \nto properly understand and subsequently describe social processes of human \ninterdependencies for as long as it relies upon presuppositions that simply do not \nstand up to the test of empirical evidence. For as long as sociology is content to \nbuttress itself upon theological and\/or metaphysical (read: heteronomous) \nfoundations, it refuses itself the ability to even set sail on its voyage. For Elias, the \nsociological Odyssey therefore steers along very treacherous surroundings, sailing \n\u2018between the Scylla of physics and the Charybdis of metaphysics\u2019 (1978: 22, 166), \n\u2018between the Scylla of \u201cstaticism\u201d\u2026and the Charybdis of the \u201chistorical relativism\u201d \nwhich sees in history only constant transformation\u2019 (2000: xii) and \u2018between the \nScylla of positivism and the Charybdis of apriorism\u2019 (2000: 471).  \n \nThe epic journey, riddled with obstacles, is made more difficult still by thoughts \nclouded in the dense fog of moral judgment, by so many \u2018oughts\u2019 masquerading as \n\u2018ises\u2019. Elias saw the sociologist as a destroyer of myths (1978: 50-70) and as such, if \ns\/he is to be capable of fulfilling such a mandate, s\/he must work only upon solid and \nsensible (i.e. non-mythical) foundations. Elias\u2019s explicitly pronounced Comteian \nindebtedness is hence to his notion of sociology as a relatively autonomous science. \nWhilst Comte is said to have failed in empirically verifying this insight, he is said to \nbe commendable for having succinctly stated the problem of sociology, a problem still \ncurrently in search of a convincing solution (1978: 33-47). As Elias argues elsewhere: \n \nNeither physicists nor philosophers so far recognise the distinct order of \nhuman beings, which we call societies, as an order with structures and \nregularities of its own, as a semi-autonomous level of the Universe. To \nestablish this fact requires a struggle against many established views and \nagainst the groups of people who are the holders of these established views \n(1982: 67). \n  19 \nThe current campaign for figurational sociology might best be understood in terms of \nthis continuing struggle. It is not only sociologists that stand to gain from success in \nthis regard, but, it is claimed, society as such, as the following sections of this paper \nwill go on to show. As the later sections of this paper will also show, however, this \nclaim is not very well supported, despite the best efforts and intentions of many \ncontemporary figurational sociologists.  \n \nThe Eventually Engaged Policy of Present Non-Engagement  \n \nUp to this point, we have identified the main reasons as to why figurational sociology \nscorns the pronounced temptation and, perhaps, the prominent tendency for \nsociologists to adopt an evaluative stance towards the political affairs of the day. Yet \nwe are by no means entitled to conclude from this partial reading that figurational \nsociology is therefore apolitical as such. Indeed, as Mennell (1977: 106) suggests, the \nopposite is in fact the case: \n \nUnderlying all Elias\u2019s writings, even those apparently least concerned with \nmundane practical problems, is a moral commitment to the calling of \nsociology and a belief that to understand the compelling nature of blind social \nprocesses is to increase the chances of controlling them. \n \nSimilarly, Kilminster and Wouters further underline the fact of figurational \nsociology\u2019s political emphasis when they say that Elias  \n \nin fact embraced a sociological programme in which illuminating the human \nsocial condition with a view to potentially changing society was \nintegral\u2026Elias wanted to encourage the development of adequate sociological \n  20 \nknowledge as an aid to understanding, and thus contributing towards \ncontrolling, blind social forces (1995: 96). \n \nHow can this be? Given what we have so far read of moral and political sentiments as \nvalues heteronomous from and as such detrimental to figurational sociology (and the \nsocial sciences more generally), how can it be said, with any degree of consistency, \nthat figurational sociology is itself determined by a moral commitment? How can it be \nthe case that figurational sociology has a place, even a foundational one, for that \nwhich it programmatically excludes as something of an interfering other (i.e. \nheteronomous values such as political commitments)? These questions demand \nfurther investigation.  \n \nReturning to our earlier example, it was not empathy that treated the patient but its \nsuspension: the sympathetic doctor was best able to realize the intention to cure by \nresorting to a state of disinterest. By going through such apathy, the doctor\u2019s prior \nempathy was given the greatest chance of being meaningfully realized. The patient \nwas best served in the process. In Elias\u2019s words, the doctor took a \u2018detour via \ndetachment\u2019 (1987b: 9, 35-36; see also Kilminster 1993: 92-3). Elias draws \nconsequences from this scenario for sociology. He argues that a similar \u2018detour via \ndetachment\u2019 might be possible if sociologists were willing to suspend their beliefs of \nhow society should be, instead focusing upon showing  \n \nhow and why the interweaving of interdependent individuals forms a level of \nintegration at which forms of organization, structures and processes cannot be \ndeduced from the biological and psychological characteristics of the \nconstituent individuals (1978: 47). \n \n  21 \nThe investigative task of sociology is stated above. Its strategic goal in light of this \ntask, Elias argues, is to make \u2018blind, uncontrolled processes more accessible to human \nunderstanding by explaining them\u2019 (1978: 154)5. The need for a long term perspective \nupon these matters becomes crucial. As Quilley and Loyal argue, when it comes to \nfigurational sociology, \u2018direct political commitments and involvements must be one \nstep removed from the immediate process of sociological investigation\u2019 (2005a: 815). \nOr as Elias himself puts it:    \n \nOur primary task is to see that the human sciences provide us with a more \nadequate, better fitting faculty to diagnose the present events in the social \nuniverse. Once we have a more realistic diagnosis, we can really determine \nwhat we should do about things. One can only make a better fitting diagnosis \nif one has long-term processes in mind. They cannot be made, as is so often \ndone today, simply by means of short-term, makeshift predictions (Elias 1998: \n150). \n \nRichard Kilminster looks forward to the future proliferation of morally and politically \ndetached sociologies, assuring everybody that \u2018the process of the development of \nsociology is not yet completed\u2019 (2004: 38) and Loyal and Quilley insist that \u2018over the \nlong term, sociology will eventually underwrite more effective political interventions\u2019 \n(2005a: 815). This long term focus is the singularly most crucial point to be \nconsidered within any discussion of the politics of figurational sociology6. In the long \nterm sociology could reach the stage where, on the basis of having achieved a more \ncomplete understanding of human figurations in the round, it might then put its \nknowledge to use \u2013 not a moment before. For now, the exact nature of these \ninterventions is not a concern nor should it even be borne in mind; the present task is \nto achieve a properly sociological investigative and explicative orientation.  \n \n  22 \nFigurational sociology is not a project launched at the absolute expense of any \npolitical vision, therefore. What many consider to be its political silence might best be \nexplained in terms of the patience it has to say something eventually, but only when \nthe time is right; a concern to not propose the under-examined, to not promote the \nunproven and to not speak without the authority of certainty. Espoused for now is a \nsort of engagement by removal, a postponed political participation and the firm \npromise of a politics to come, at some stage, in the long term.  \n \nIt is in this sense that Kilminster suggests that the figurational sociologist\u2019s political \npassion might for now be channeled into and expressed through the work he or she \ndoes (2004: 33). This would be to convert figurational sociology into a vocation. This \nis indeed the suggestion. Motivated by its patience for a politics to come, figurational \nsociology works forward with purpose, strengthened by the confidence that it will one \nday arrive at the point of being prepared to say something politically and morally \ndefinitive, in the long term. For now, however, the will to become involved is \nsuspended, through the detour via detachment, and is instead placed at the vocational \nlevel. The figurational sociologist thereby becomes deeply involved in their work, for \nthe sake of the politics that might one day come, adopting a disposition which Elias \ncalls secondary involvement (1987b: lii).  \n \nFigurational sociologists admit that such a transition will not be easily had. A \nsignificant challenge lies ahead7. One need only consider the dynamics of double-bind \nscenarios, as Elias himself does (1987b: 99), to recognize the inherent difficulty of \neven suggesting the inauguration, not to mention the following through, of any project \n  23 \nwhich would hope to successfully detour via detachment. For now, we cannot know \nwhere the detour via detachment will take us, nor do we know whether a sufficient \nnumber of people are prepared to take such a detour. Nevertheless, for as long as \nunknowns such as these remain unknown to us, figurational sociology\u2019s eventual \npolitical affiliations will also. \n \nThis is a questionable position. Before arguing why it is questionable, I will first of all \nlay the final foundations for my argument by alluding towards two distinct and \nseparate ways in which figurational sociology has discussed social processes with \nrespect to control. On the one hand there exists an empirically derived, retrospectively \nfocused understanding of control. Control, in this sense, is a general affair which \nsocial scientists can make no special claims towards. On the other hand, there exists \nan understanding of control which is speculatively derived and prospectively focused. \nControl, in this sense, is a general affair whilst also being something which the social \nscientist possesses special knowledge about.  \n \nControl as a Socially Prevalent, Really Existing Force \n \nFor anybody that has ever taken even so much as a passing interest in the writings of \nfigurational sociologists, the first understanding of control requires little introduction. \nThis is the understanding of control figurational sociologists derive from the empirical \nobservation that individuals have gradually formed a disposition to manage their own \nconduct, without necessarily having to be coerced into doing so. For figurational \nsociologists, the manner in which individuals have come to learn to restrain their own \n  24 \nactions is itself an empirically demonstrable sociological phenomenon. Let The \nCivilizing Process and indeed the entire figurational oeuvre stand testament to this \nclaim. It is patently not the case that what Elias called \u2018The Civilizing Process\u2019 was \n(and indeed continues to be) something imposed upon each individual, sociologist or \notherwise, as if from the outside. For in as much as the Civilizing Process is an \nhistorical-sociological phenomenon, it is also a psychological, one might even say an \nexistential, one. Within civilized societies, each individual learns to become civilized. \nThe issue is not one of kind but rather one of degree. As Elias argues: \n \nThere is no zero-point of civilizing processes, no point at which human beings \nare uncivilized and as it were begin to be civilized. No human being lacks the \ncapacity for self-restraint. No human group could function for any length of \ntime whose adults failed to develop, within the wild and at first totally \nunrestrained little beings, as which humans are born, patterns of self-\nregulation and self-restraint [sic]. What changes in the course of a civilizing \nprocess are the social patterns of individual self-restraint and the manner in \nwhich they are built into the individual person in the form of what one now \ncalls \u2018conscience\u2019 or perhaps \u2018reason\u2019 (1992: 146)8. \n \nOn this topic of each and every individual\u2019s capacity towards self-restraint, Elias \ndiscusses what he calls \u2018the triad of basic controls \u2013 control over natural processes, \nover social processes and, individually, over the processes of their own selves\u2019 \n(1987b: 66). Elias shows elsewhere (1987c) that humans have gradually learned to \ncontrol their own emotions towards certain ends, resulting in the proliferation of \nvarious scenarios of what he calls the controlled de-controlling of emotional controls \n(see also Wouters 1987, 1986)9. This term designates the sort of scenario wherein \nindividuals become so aware of the existence of formal or implicit constraints upon \ntheir own behavior, and the behavior of those with whom they are associating, that the \nrules which usually govern \u2018civilized\u2019 behavior become gradually relaxed. \n  25 \nCompetitive sport, as Elias and Dunning (1986) show, is perhaps the most obvious \nmodern example of such a controlled decontrolling of emotions: its very existence so \nvividly illustrates the capacity of many individuals to be simultaneously emotionally \noverawed and nonetheless internally governed by a variety of elaborate rules of \nconduct.  \n \nIt so follows that one does not have to be an intellectual, social scientific or otherwise, \nin order to be capable of controlling their actions towards civilized ends. Kilminster \nsuggests that this very insistence upon every human being\u2019s capacity for self-restraint \nrepresents one of the major distinctions that can be made between the work of Elias \nand that of Karl Mannheim, for example. For Kilminster, Mannheim emphasizes the \nneed for social planners because he (Mannheim) firmly believes that individuals do \nnot possess the heightened capacity for self-constraint which Elias attributes to them. \nThe result of this being that for Kilminster, Mannheim\u2019s model of control implies a \n\u2018perhaps greater authoritarianism than he probably would have admitted\u2019 (1993: 104).  \nAs Kilminster puts it in more forthright terms still: \n \nElias did not share Mannheim\u2019s commitment of sociology to the guiding of \npractical measures to effect changes in the wider society, within the tradition \nof liberalism. Rather, he took a longer-term view and had a more circumspect \nattitude towards the possibilities of controlling blind social forces through \nplanning (1993: 83). \n \nThe mentioning of this \u2018more circumspect attitude\u2019 paves the way towards a \ndiscussion of figurational sociology\u2019s second understanding of control with which I \nam presently concerned. Whilst it is of course the case that the emphasis of \nfigurational sociology has traditionally been upon the demarcation of the limits of \n  26 \ncontrol, rather than the establishment and maintenance of it, there are also various \noccasions where figurational sociology nonetheless insists upon a certain notion of \nsocial planning which is undertaken by specialists. It is towards an elaboration upon \nthe significance of occasions like these which this paper now turns. \n \nControl as a Socially Stratified, Spectrally Possible Force \n \nAs has been already argued, figurational sociologists believe that it is crucial to \neventually adopt a politically facilitative role. This politically facilitative role cannot \nbe adopted just yet, however. The facts are simply not yet ready to hand. A sustained \nperiod of evaluative detachment and patient sociological investigation are required in \norder to bring them about. Any worthwhile social policy can be derived only out of \nthese facts. Such a factually derived social policy, for its part, will eventually be \noriented towards achieving better control over networks of human interdependencies. \nOr, to reassert in the language of figurational sociology: sociology, having eventually \nbecome a relatively more autonomous discipline, having taken a prolonged detour via \ndetachment, on the basis of a generalized commitment to a state of secondary \ninvolvement, will fulfill its evaluative promise by aiding the achievement of the end \nof control. Elias maintains this position throughout his work:  \n \nPerhaps by understanding better the compelling forces at work in a \nconfiguration such as that of the established and the outsiders one may in time \nbe able to devise practical measures capable of controlling them [Emphasis \nadded] (Elias and Scotson, 1994: 173).    \n  \nThe task of sociological research is to make these blind, uncontrolled \nprocesses more accessible to human understanding by explaining them, and to \n  27 \nenable people to orientate themselves within the interwoven social web \u2013 \nwhich, though created by their own needs and actions, is still opaque to them \u2013 \nand so better to control it [Emphasis in the original] (Elias, 1978: 154).  \n \nWe can only elicit sociological knowledge which is sufficiently adequate to be \nof use in solving the acute problems of society if, in posing and solving \nsociological problems, we cease giving precedence to preconceived notions of \nwhat the solutions ought to be over the investigation of what is [Emphasis \nadded] (Elias, 2000: 460). \n \nThese excerpts offer some quite telling axioms. In the first, we learn that sociology \nmight eventually devise practical mechanisms for controlling social configurations. In \nthe second, we learn that the task of sociological research is to help people to \nunderstand the social web, so that they can better orient themselves within it. And in \nthe third, we learn that sociological knowledge, properly gathered, can both pose and \nsolve the acute problems of society. Elsewhere, in an interview with Peter Ludes, \nElias is asked whether he believes intellectuals, especially social scientists, should \nwork out alternatives to the predominant patterns of social life. Elias responds in the \naffirmative and illustrates how this might come about by reciting a fable which he \nentitles \u2018The Great Struggle of the Intellectuals\u2019 (Elias 1984: 231-241)10. This fable is \nperhaps the closest Elias ever came to making a positive assertion of what he felt a \nsocial utopia would be like. Like all fables, of course, it has to be taken with a pinch \nof salt. Pinch of salt in hand then, what is perhaps most apparent about this particular \nsocial utopia is the significance that Elias gives to specialist intellectuals within its \ndecision making mechanism11. Figurational sociology\u2019s need for specialist \nintellectuals in the constitution of social strategy is elsewhere underscored by \nGousdblom when he remarks:  \n \n  28 \nClearly there is a need in contemporary societies for specialists who explore \nsocial processes, who fill in the gaps in our knowledge of the changing social \nuniverse, and who expose disguised mythologies\u2026Until now, no group has \nmanaged to come into its own as a professional group with sufficiently \ndeveloped institutional safeguards against the intrusion of heteronomous \nevaluations (1977b: 83\/1987: 335). \n \nIt is clear that the sociologist, more precisely the sociologist of the future, is given a \nprivileged place within these writings. Irrespective of whether the issue is control or \nthe facilitation of control, it is an issue for the eventually existing sociological \nspecialist. These specialists will eventually achieve a standpoint from which they can \nget a better view of social processes. Accordingly, they will be both those who really \nknow the potential controllability of social processes and also those who should be \nprioritized within any discussion of social control. These specialists, these social \nscientists of the future, will eventually be in a position to \u2018solve the acute problems of \nsociety\u2019 and to \u2018devise practical measures capable of controlling them\u2019. Nowhere does \nElias argue that the human capacity towards self-restraint is a product of sociology. \nBut it seems that the sociologists of the future will eventually become producers of \njust this form of practical knowledge. This is a promise which figurational sociology \nhas made, a promise which its specialists will seemingly deliver upon in time. \n \nSuch an understanding of control is not at all easily squared with the understanding of \ncontrol outlined in the previous section. There, control was a descriptive phenomenon \nderived out of empirical observation. Here, control is a prescriptive phenomenon \nderived out of self-confident speculation. There, control was a capacity ascertainable \nby human beings in general. Here, control is something ascertainable by the \nsociologist of the future. There, control was an equitably distributed privilege of \n  29 \nhuman beings as such. Here, control is a privilege towards which specialist \nintellectuals will eventually become entitled. These two separate concepts of control \nare in no way complimentary. On the contrary, as I will show in the following section, \none notion undermines the other: control cannot be consistently understood both \nways. I will demonstrate why this is the case by raising a series of related questions to \nwhich figurational sociology has yet to offer any satisfactory answers.  \n \nQuestioning the Politics of Control \n \nThe Harmonization Question \n  \nWe know that figurational sociology offers a long term, process oriented \nunderstanding of control. Furthermore, we also know from figurational sociologists \nthat control is not to be understood in absolute terms but rather in relative terms, that \ncontrol isn\u2019t simply a matter of coercion and that individuals have gradually \ndeveloped the capacity for self-restraint. But at the same time, we are also told that \nsocial scientists might eventually be in a position to aid, perhaps even direct social \nprocesses, towards particular ends. As Stephen Mennell once said \n \nSomewhere in The Civilizing Process Elias speculates that the potential for \nplanning social life is increasing\u2026but the general implication of the game \nmodels runs against that: there is certainly room for further discussion here \n(1987: 560). \n \nFor the sake of furthering this discussion, the first question I would like to ask is the \nfollowing: how can the assertion that individuals have the capacity for self-restraint be \n  30 \nsquared with the assertion that social scientists will eventually be in a position to help, \neven direct, social processes towards certain worthwhile constraints? To put it \notherwise, if individuals are gradually developing the capacity towards self-restraint \nthen what need do they have for specialists in this area? And on the other hand, if \nsuch specialists are required then what is the point in highlighting the fact that \nindividuals are capable of self-restraint if they are always going to require such \nspecialists, irrespective of their own capacities?  \n \nIf there is already control then control is not necessarily needed. And if there is not yet \nenough control then more control is perhaps needed. Figurational sociology, for its \npart, seems to assert both that there is sufficient control (in the sense that individuals \nhave the capacity towards self-restraint) and that more control is needed (in the sense \nthat social scientists will eventually help effectuate appropriate measures towards \ncontrol). It is not at all clear at present how the latter concept of control is in any way \nharmonious with the former.   \n \nThe Speculation Question  \n \nThe assertion that any body of knowledge will be one day capable of solving the acute \nproblems of society is a reassuring one. One can certainly draw comfort from \nfigurational sociology\u2019s promise of a control to come. In the long run, social science \nwill have developed tools that will facilitate in the creation of more effective political \nstrategies (more effective than a politics built upon the foundation of the present day, \nnot sufficiently detached social sciences). Such optimistic clairvoyance, a \n  31 \nclairvoyance which posits the future as the proof of its politics, must, however, at \nsome point deliver upon its promise for it not to be found wanting. Put differently: in \norder for figurational sociology\u2019s prophecies to be seen as sound, the future must one \nday come and this future must bring with it figurational sociology\u2019s much anticipated, \ncontinuously promised yet frequently postponed coherent political position. If such a \nposition is not eventually achieved then all talk of detouring via detachment will have \nnecessarily amounted to nothing.  \n \nFigurational sociologists believe that the day of a politically oriented social science \nwill eventually come, even if only in a facilitative role. But this belief, like so many \nother beliefs as to how the future will be, is not and cannot be supported by empirical \nevidence. Certainly, this particular belief is informed by faith in the idea that the \ntrends of the past will continue into the future. But there are no absolute guarantees \nthat these trends will actually continue into the future. One can either believe that they \nwill continue, or one can believe otherwise. Advocates of figurational sociology, for \ntheir part, choose the path of optimism. Pessimists, it seems, are to persuade \nthemselves as to the virtues of patience. Insight into the form which the future politics \nof figurational sociology, facilitative or otherwise, will assume will be given in the \nlong term. Until then it seems that pessimists are required to believe, along with \nfigurational sociologists, that the detour via detachment is one worth taking.  \n \nSuch a take on politics certainly demands something akin to a leap of faith. My \nsecond question, then, is the following: in the final analysis, how do figurational \nsociologists know, without any doubt, that the detour via detachment will be \n  32 \nultimately worth taking? I say without any doubt because figurational sociology must \nbe certain that benefits are to be found in taking the detour via detachment in order to \njustify its present day political silence. This is not a criterion which I am imposing \nonto figurational sociology. It is, as has been shown, rather the very manner in which \nfigurational sociology judges itself insofar as its tendency towards social evaluation \nand manipulation is concerned. It is only because politics (or any sort of social \nintervention) is held as being a long term concern that figurational sociologists \neschew present day social policy. \n \nThe Implementation Question \n \nAs has been shown, Elias repeatedly affirmed his outright reluctance to name the \nissues which the sociologists of the future would eventually address; his followers \nseem quite content to follow suit. In this sense, it is very difficult to speak of the \npolitics of figurational sociology other than to say that they are of a derivative nature. \nWe do not even have much material at our disposal with which we might fathom a \nguess as to what figurational sociology\u2019s politics might eventually be like, so \nconsistent are its representatives on this very point. All of this because the politics of \nfigurational sociology are intentionally concealed in conscious anticipation of \nrigorous scientific data, out of which a politics might then be constructed. Social \nscience will not, indeed cannot, be directed by non-scientific values. Detached \ninvestigation must precede any sort of practical intervention.  \n \n  33 \nAssuming for now that figurational sociology\u2019s proposed separation between \nautonomous and heteronomous values can actually be made in a non-contradictory \nmanner, the need to consider the transition from a stage of description towards a stage \nof implementation must be embraced at some stage. In simultaneously putting the \nproblems of intervention\u2019s content, save \u2018control\u2019, off for another day and through \ninsisting that intervention\u2019s form will be such that it will be capable of \u2018solving the \nacute problems in society\u2019, it is necessarily implied that at some point, somebody will \nhave to take figurational sociology\u2019s politics seriously.   \n \nBut in explaining the social world, the sociologist does not automatically form a \nnatural disposition towards controlling it. Explanation and control are two distinct and \nseparate tasks. Belief in the contrary does not make the contrary the case. The will to \nintervention must be inaugurated before it can be practiced. That being the case, there \nhas not yet been such an inauguration done in the name of figurational sociology. \nNeither in Elias\u2019s work, nor in the work of his followers, have the many serious \nchallenges consequential to the sociologist\u2019s transition from observer to \ncontroller\/control facilitator, a transition directly implied by their writings, been \nadequately addressed.  \n \nMy third question, therefore, is two-fold and of a primarily tactical orientation. On the \none hand, what will be the institutional framework that will grant to figurational \nsociology the position which it sees as necessary to itself insofar as control facilitation \nis concerned? On the other hand, how will this position be obtained and secured by \nfigurational sociologists? I wonder whether we are to take Elias\u2019s version of a social \n  34 \nutopia, as laid down within his interview with Peter Ludes, as indicative in this regard. \nIf so, this third question would then focus upon the question of whether such a utopia \nis itself worth striving towards. If not, this third question would then focus upon the \nneed for a consideration of how figurational sociology\u2019s ideals are to be implemented.    \n \nThe Justification Question  \n \nThe fourth question I want to ask has already been posed, in a round about way, by \nthe work of Arnason (1987, see also Bogner 1987 esp.: 268-279). As far as I can tell, \nit has not yet been adequately addressed by any figurational sociologist. Put simply, \nthe question is this: why control? In other words why, despite figurational sociology\u2019s \nmoral and political procrastination, does there exist such a normative casting of \ncontrol throughout the writings of Elias (and also his followers)? What is so \nundeniably wonderful about control that it requires no justification? Why is it that we \ncan all seemingly agree that control is that which the social sciences should eventually \nstrive towards?  \n \nAs Arnason (1987: 450) points out, \u2018the concept of control is not culturally neutral\u2019. \nFor this very reason, figurational sociology\u2019s goal of control must itself be justified by \nfigurational sociologists. Elias\u2019s position on social control seems to have recourse to \none of the many heteronomous values which, as has already been demonstrated, he \nwas at pains to exorcise from his project for the sake of the project. When Elias and \nhis followers predict a controlling sociology we are entitled to ask control for what? \nControl towards what? Control away from what? Control in the name of what? Whose \n  35 \ncontrol? Who controls? Who is controlled? And what is it that justifies the idea of \n\u2018control\u2019 as the hopefully one day obtained achievement of sociology and, indeed, of \nthe social sciences more generally?  \n \nI think that if it is to be consistent, figurational sociology cannot answer such \nquestions without conceding something else along the way, this precisely because \nfigurational sociology seeks to create a space for itself that is autonomous from just \nthese very questions. Yet in raising the issue of \u2018control\u2019 as an issue with which \nsociologists might be one day concerned, Elias implicated every single one of these \nheteronomous values within the very structure of that which apparently functions by \nkeeping them outside (i.e. figurational sociology). On initially studying the works of \nfigurational sociology we find that the proper place of moral and political questions is \nnot within figurational sociology since reflection upon these very issues is considered \ndetrimental to sociology\u2019s existence. And yet, when we study the matter more \ncarefully, we find that in seeking the possibility of social control and naming it as an \neventual goal, the very elements excluded from the sociological edifice become its \nmost basic, constituent parts. These questions simply cannot be avoided, in other \nwords. Either a case is to be made for why control is an autonomous value of \nsociology. Or else control is to be constituted as a value heteronomous to sociology, \nand dismissed accordingly. \n \nThe Contradiction Question  \n \n  36 \nThe final question I want to raise returns to the discussion invited by Stephen Mennell \nwith which this section opened. Within this particular piece, Mennell was responding \nto the point raised by Hans Haferkamp (1987a, see also 1987b) concerning the \npremature undermining of social planning within Elias\u2019s work. For Haferkamp, \nfigurational sociologists cannot dismiss planning actions apriori, precisely because \nthe question of whether social planning can be successful is an empirical question. For \nme, the question is not so much whether Elias is right or wrong in de-prioritizing \nsocial prescription. My final question is rather to ask whether figurational sociology is \nactually being consistent with itself when it posits the goal of control as a goal towards \nwhich it should aspire. For me, it is questionable as to whether an emphasis upon a \nsocial control to come is in any way consistent with the core of the figurational \nproject.  \n \nIn particular, the idea of the sociologist as a controller is not at all tenable within \nElias\u2019s own work which is at pains to emphasize the blind, unplanned, non-\nteleological course of social development: \u2018From plans arising yet unplanned. By \npurpose moved, yet purposeless\u2019 (1991: 64) as he once so eloquently put it. The \nstatistical table indexing the complexity of societies outlined in What is Sociology? \n(1978: 100-103) or Elias\u2019s critique of the apparently fraudulent presuppositions \nembedded within \u2018development studies\u2019 sociology (1978: 145-156) are enough to \nsuggest that he would be the first to banish the idea of a thing called \u2018society\u2019 being a \ncontrollable object from his own work.  \n \n  37 \nYet Elias\u2019s stance against sociology as strategy is more deep seated still. The \nunplanned, unintentional and non-voluntarist development of human societies is, for \nmost if not all of his commentators, one of the core foundations upon which his entire \nproject is built (e.g. Fletcher, 1997; Goudsblom, 1977; Goudsblom and Mennell, \n1998; Mennell, 1998; Mennell and Goudsblom, 1998; Smith, 2000 and van Krieken, \n1998, also see esp. Mennell, 1977 pace Merton, 1936). If human figurations might \none day be the subject of conscious control then social development is, in the final \nanalysis, not blind and unplanned and hence, Elias\u2019s utopian predictions (i.e. \nsociology might one day be in a position to control society) bear no relation to his \npremises (i.e. social development is blind and unplanned). A programmatic principle \ncannot be simultaneously true and false, figurational sociology cannot have it both \nways. Either society has the capacity for being controlled - in which case figurational \nsociology loses one of its core foundations. Or else society does not have the capacity \nfor being controlled \u2013 in which case there is no longer a need for sociological \nspecialists. In either case, as I have already said, something has to give way.     \n \nConclusion \n \nFigurational sociology sees itself to be best serving any future political interventions it \nmight one day make by not formally considering the nature of these future \ninterventions for now. Rigorous sociological investigation serves to suppress moral \nand political allegiances in what Elias calls a secondary involvement. Figurational \nsociology realizes its political affiliations by taking a detached detour via secondary \nvocational involvement. For the time being it must stammer at the point of policy, \n  38 \nindeed, on issues of policy it insists upon remaining without anything to say. \nFurthermore, it will have no need to apologize in this regard: moral and political \nsilence is a necessary condition of sociological investigation as far as Elias is \nconcerned; heteronomous concerns serve as impediments to the possibility of \nsociology becoming autonomous from other disciplines. Without sociology achieving \na relatively high level of autonomy, there will be nothing justifying the socio-political \ninterventions it eventually makes. \n \nAt the very same time, the hope of bringing human interrelationships under the \nconscious control of those who understand the manner in which they function (i.e. the \nsociologists-to-come) underpins all of Elias\u2019s work. Figurational sociology does see \nitself as one day being capable of making well informed political interventions. It is \nnot solely scientific curiosity that nourishes the figurational sociologist\u2019s imagination. \nSecondary involvement is itself a way towards creating the possibilities of appropriate \ninterventions. The will to action undeniably exists but it is temporarily suspended for \nthe sake of sufficiently developing the proper capacity towards intervention. Elias\u2019s \nposition on the potential malleability of society was done in the name of a sociology \nthat does not presently exist. But, as has been shown in this paper, these sociologists \nto come will at some stage have to engage with moral and political questions if they \nhope to implement moral and political controls. On this unresolved issue, an issue \nwhich Elias doubtless recognized yet simultaneously denied, a lot of work is to be \ndone.  \n \n  39 \nThis brings me full circle back to the political campaign mentioned at the beginning \nof this paper: the campaign for figurational sociology. Bearing in mind Loyal and \nQuilleys\u2019 Eliasian inspired polemic for the \u2018necessity of a scientific sociology\u2019 \n(2005b: 849), I would suggest that this \u2018necessity\u2019 itself requires more in the way of \njustification and less in the way of affirmation. Figurational sociologists must \nconfront the problematic place of the two distinct and separate ideas of controlling \nsociety evident within Elias\u2019 work, particularly in the face of the fact that his \nsociology denies itself the very idea of the socially transcendent agency directly \nsuggested by the latter concept of social control discussed above. If we are to have \nany faith in figurational sociology\u2019s muted promise of a politics to come, we are \ncollectively entitled to a broader discussion of what form that politics might assume. \nOnly when figurational sociology becomes more forthcoming in this regard may it go \nabout the business of affirming its own political significance in good faith.  \n \nFigurational sociologists do not imagine their work as eternally dwelling upon the \ntask of interpreting the social world. At some point they too will want to play their \nhand in changing it. Into what will the social world be changed once figurational \nsociology reaches its promised level of sophistication? The question remains in search \nof a solution \u2013 attempting to work towards it would doubtlessly strengthen the \nmanifesto behind and campaign for figurational sociology. \n \n \n \n \n  40 \nFootnotes \n \n1. That said, Mennell himself points out in his Preface \u201cElias feels that his work speaks \ndirectly for itself\u201d (1998: x). Perhaps Elias\u2019s work is itself the best introduction to Elias\u2019s \nwork.  \n \n2. One could also look towards the Norbert Elias Foundation (see \nhttp:\/\/www.norberteliasfoundation.nl\/), the seemingly discontinued Figurations newsletter \n(see http:\/\/www.norberteliasfoundation.nl\/index_ND.htm) as well as the fact that the most \nrecent \u2018Elias in the 21st Century\u2019 conference (Leicester: 2006) announced plans for the \nlaunching of Anthroposphere: A Journal for the Human Sciences, an interdisciplinary journal \nwhich would be largely guided by Eliasian concepts, for further evidence as to the existence \nof a campaign for figurational sociology.  \n \nIt should also be said that whilst the case is presently being made for figurational sociology, \nfigurational sociologists themselves refuse to cast Elias\u2019s work with recourse to \u2018the old great \nman theory\u2019 (Elias, 1971: 7, c.f. Loyal and Quilley, 2005b: 843). Offering neither a \nsociological starting point nor a theoretical system without precedent, Stephen Loyal and \nStephen Quilley point out that in many ways \u201cElias\u2019s value lies, somewhat paradoxically, in \nhis profound unoriginality\u201d (2005b: 243). Genius, for Elias, is not genesis, it is not the \nproperty of an isolated individual projected onto its environment but something produced \nbetween individuals bound to one another within a spatially and temporally dynamic \nfiguration. Figurational sociology bids an un-fond farewell to the idea of the autonomous \nindividual as locus of meaning or starting point of enquiry.  \n \nElias continually disparaged such ego-centric (1978, 14-15) images of man as homo clausus \n(2000: 472). In his Adorno prize acceptance speech he proudly acknowledges the reception of \na torch from his predecessors that he will, in turn, carry forward to his successors (1977: 67, \nc.f Korte, 2001: 18). Elsewhere, he insists that the \u201cway in which an individual person goes \nabout thinking, perceiving, or performing scientific work is grounded in the thought processes \nof previous generations\u201d (1978: 37). Elias\u2019s study of Mozart is a pertinent point of reference \nin this regard (1993) as is his analysis of a letter from Goethe to a friend regarding the \nremarkably great mind of the 24 year old \u2018Amp\u00e9re\u2019 (2000: 22-26). \n \n3. Goudsblom (1977b: 80\/1986: 331) argues: \n \nSubject to an unplanned and apparently incontrollable process of increasing \nspecialization, sociology, and indeed social science in general, is badly in need of a \nunifying central theory or perspective which might serve as a guide for the various \nspecialisms and which might help to show how they are related to each other. Elias\u2019s \nwork constitutes a deliberate attempt to counteract the forces that threaten to break up \nthe social sciences into a congeries of disconnected fields. It represents an effort to \nrescue sociology from disintegration through specialization. No matter how badly \nsuch an attempt is needed, it is bound to meet with great resistance. It goes against \nvested interests in specialization, and runs counter to dominant habits of thought  \n \n4. In the same article Pels goes on  to argue: \nPerhaps more than any of his accused, Elias himself has been homo clausus, turning \nhis back upon an intellectual world which would never listen to this particular \nstranger\u2019s voice. His followers have been quite successful in setting up a closed shop \nin their particular corner of the social-scientific world (p. 182). \n  41 \nTowards which Mennell (1991: 187-8) responds by saying: \n \nI do not believe, pace Pels, that the research of those sociologists influenced by Elias \nproceeds without reference to and engagement with other intellectual standpoints\u2026I \nwonder whether the openness of the \u2018Eliasians\u2019 to ideas from many other disciplines, \nand the total absence of sociological chauvinism among them, is something that gets \nup the noses of more narrowly discipline-proud sociologists? \n \n5. For Richard Kilminster, the very fact that figurational sociology gives pride of place to a \nconsideration of politics should not really be that surprising. As he argues \n \nThere is a forgotten \u2018evaluative\u2019 dimension, born in the German tradition of the \nsociology of knowledge. It has its origins as a moral-political strategy, a wager for a \nstrong scientific sociology as a counterweight to the spiraling social and ideological \nconflicts of the 1930s. Sociology can evaluate the feasibility, credibility and \ndesirability of reform programs put forward by political groups and in political \nideologies and illuminate the roots of conflict. At the same time, coming from this \ntradition it means almost certainly that Elias takes it for granted, hence does not \nalways bother to keep repeating, that sociology can be comparative, empirical \ninquiries into real societies, also significantly reframe so-called \u2018ethical\u2019 questions \nposed by philosophers. It is thus obvious that Elias is no practitioner of any simple-\nminded \u2018value-free\u2019 sociology (1991: 173). \n \n6. Elsewhere Elias argues:  \n \nNo doubt a long-term perspective demands a greater capacity for distancing oneself \nfor a while from the situation of the moment. But it also opens the way towards a \ngreater detachment from the wishes and fears of the moment, and thus from time-\nbound fantasies. It increases the chance of a more fact-oriented diagnosis (1987b: xv). \n \nAnd: \n \nAt present the emphasis on short-term forecasting threatens to stifle basic or long-\nterm research and theory building in sociology\u2026We need more basic research into \nthe largely unknown human universe, in order to find out why things have happened, \nand why they are happening today (1998: 149-50). \n \n7. As well as the challenge being recognized as significant, the stakes are believed to be \nnothing short of grand. Consider: \n \nGalileo is still remembered as an exponent of the struggle of physics for autonomy \nfrom powerful extra-scientific ideals, in that case particularly the religious type. As \nfar as can be seen, representatives of sociological theories, and indeed of theories in \nthe human sciences generally, are as yet hardly aware that an analogous struggle for \nautonomy lies ahead of them. But in their case the principal fight for emancipation \nhas the character of a struggle for autonomy from the political and social ideals of the \nday (Elias 1987a: 225). \n \n8. As Helmut Kuzmics insists: \nIn addition to self-coercion, which has been forced upon the individual from outside, \nElias has always stressed the importance of self-control. Socialization under civilised \nconditions uses up a lot of time and other resources. Elias has often been criticised as \n  42 \nif his image of man were purely reactive, as if his model of socialisaion only involves \nconditioning through fear and coercion and leaves no room for the pleasures of \nlearning. This sweeping judgment is misguided (1987: 523). \n \n9. Cas Wouters (1987: 426) traces the expression back to a series of lectures Elias gave at the \nUniversity of Amsterdam during 1970-1971. \n \n10. In another interview, this time with Johan Goudsblom, Elias again gestures towards the \nnecessity for sociologists to play their hand in controlling social processes:  \n \nIt is necessary to form a theory so that, in the future, we may be able to judge more \nclosely what kind of restraints are required for complicated societies to function and \nwhat type of restraints have been merely built into us to bolster up the authority of \ncertain ruling groups. What I have done is not enough, it is only one step. We must \nfind out more about it. We do not know. I do not believe that we can live entirely \nwithout restraints, as some communes today try to do. But I firmly believe that the \nways in which restraints are built in today are wasteful and uneconomical (Elias \n1998: 145). \n \n11. This is obvious from the text of the interview itself. Micael Bj\u00f6rk (2005: 58) suggests that \nwithin this particular interview: \n  \nElias asserted that intellectuals should stimulate a detached involvement in the body \npolitic. He did not think that intellectuals were everything, but he thought that in a \nperiod of crisis they could make a difference, \u2018backed by a wide public opinion to \nmake governments think twice\u2019 (Elias, 1984: 287). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  43 \nReferences \n \nArnason, Johann (1987) \u2018Figurational Sociology as a Counter-Paradigm\u2019, Theory, Culture & \nSociety, 4, 429-456. \nBauman, Zygmunt (1979) \u2018The phenomenon of Norbert Elias\u2019, Sociology, 13, 117-125. \nBj\u00f6rk, Micael (2005) \u2018A plea for detached involvement: Norbert Elias on intellectuals and  \npolitical imagination in inter-war Germany\u2019 History of the Human Sciences, 18(2), 43-61. \nBogner, Artur (1987) \u2018Elias and the Frankfurt School\u2019, Theory, Culture & Society, 4, 249- \n285. \nCoser, Lewis (1979) \u2018Review of What is Sociology?\u2019, American Journal of Sociology, 86(1),  \n192-194. \nDunning, Eric (1989) \u2018A Response to R.J.
