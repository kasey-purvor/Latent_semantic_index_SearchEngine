In many regions of the 5 \nworld impacts on peatland hydrology have been noted (e.g. Klein et al., 2005). The 6 \npeatlands likely to show the greatest impacts are the most marginal sites in regions which 7 \nexperience the greatest climate change. Such a case may be the Mediterranean region, 8 \nwhere peatlands are rare but are often climatically marginal and are likely to be sensitive 9 \nto comparatively minor climatic changes. Mediterranean peatlands are relatively 10 \nunimportant in terms of their carbon reserve but are extremely important in terms of 11 \nregional biodiversity.  12 \nMeteorological records for northern Greece show a general trend of reduced 13 \nprecipitation over the last c.50 years. Climatic impacts on the hydrology of northern 14 \nGreece have already been noted and are modelled to increase in severity over coming 15 \ndecades with consequent impacts for human populations (Mimikou, 1993; Mimikou et 16 \nal., 1999; 2000; B\u00fcrger, 2002; Baltas and Mimikou, 2005). These changes may have 17 \naffected peatlands in the region. Most peatlands in Greece have been heavily impacted by 18 \nhuman activity primarily through drainage for agriculture in the 20th Century, and often 19 \nhave low conservation value (Bouzinos et al., 1994; 1997; Christanis, 1996). An 20 \nexception to this is the Elatia Mires of northern Macedonia, where remoteness and Cold 21 \nWar access restrictions have prevented major impacts. These mires are the most 22 \noligotrophic peatlands in Greece and are probably the only location in the southern 23 \n 4\nBalkans where many wetland endemics typical of more nutrient-poor conditions may be 1 \nfound. These are the only peatlands in Greece where Sphagnum is a permanent presence. 2 \nDue to their unique nature the Elatia Mires have been a focus of recent conservation 3 \nattention. This study uses a palaeoecological approach based on testate amoebae analysis 4 \nto test the hypothesis that the hydrology of the Elatia mires is responding to recent 5 \nclimatic changes.  6 \n  7 \nSITES and METHODS 8 \n 9 \nThe Elatia Mires lie in the Elatia Forest, approximately 70 km north of the city of 10 \nDrama and 5 km south of the Bulgarian frontier at around 1500m asl. (41\u02da29\u2019N, 24\u02da19\u2019E; 11 \nFig. 1). Four small peatlands are situated in clearings within a natural coniferous forest 12 \ndominated by Picea abies, the only such forest in Greece (Papazisimou et al., 2002). A 13 \ncomparatively cool and moist climate combined with impermeable granite bedrocks have 14 \nallowed peat formation. Peat deposits are shallow, probably not exceeding 1 m of 15 \ncontinuous peat, although deeper, buried, peat deposits are also found in one site. The 16 \nmires have been termed the sites \u2018transitional\u2019 due to their mix of features typical of fens 17 \nand bogs (Papazisimou et al 2002). Samples were extracted from the two most 18 \noligotrophic sites: Dexameni mire (site DE; mean pH 6.5) and Krya Vrissi mire (site KB; 19 \nmean pH 6.4). Vegetation of the mires includes Juncus effusus, Carex spp., Eriophorum 20 \nlatifolium, Myosotis spp., Geum spp., Ranunculus spp., Mentha spicta, Plagiomnium 21 \nelatum, Sphagnum flexuosum, Aulacomnium palustris and Climacium dendroides 22 \n(Papazisimou et al 2002).  23 \n 5\nPeat monoliths between 16 and 26 cm in length were extracted by cutting down 1 \nfrom the peat surface. Two monoliths were removed from central areas of the Krya Vrissi 2 \nmire and one from Dexameni; denoted KB1, KB2 and DE respectively. Peat stratigraphy 3 \nwas noted and humification recorded on the Von Post scale (Von Post, 1924).  4 \nTestate amoebae analysis was used to reconstruct changes in hydrology through 5 \nthe length of the monoliths. Testate amoebae are shell-forming unicellular 6 \nmicroorganisms that are abundant in peatlands and sensitive to peatland hydrology. By 7 \nanalysing the changing community composition down the length of a peat core and 8 \ninterpreting the results with a transfer function model it is possible to reconstruct how 9 \nmire wetness has varied over time (Charman, 2001; Mitchell et al., 2008). Such 10 \nreconstructions have been validated by comparison with instrumental data and 11 \nindependent proxy-climatic records (Charman and Hendon, 2000; Charman et al., 2004; 12 \nSchoning et al., 2005).  13 \nPeat sub-samples for testate amoebae analysis were boiled in deionised water, 14 \nfiltered at 250 \u03bcm and then back-filtered at 15 \u03bcm with the 15>250 \u03bcm fraction retained 15 \n(Hendon and Charman, 1997). Slides were made up with glycerol and amoebae identified 16 \nfollowing the taxonomic scheme described in Payne and Mitchell (2007); a count of 150 17 \ntests was aimed for. Amoebae diagrams were constructed using C2 ver. 1.4 (Juggins, 18 \n2003) and zoned using optimal sum of squares partitioning (Birks and Gordon, 1985) in 19 \nZONE ver. 1.2 (Juggins, 1992). Quantitative environmental reconstruction was carried 20 \nout using the transfer function model developed by Payne and Mitchell (2007). Depth to 21 \nwater table (DWT) was reconstructed using a maximum likelihood model (RMSEPboot 22 \n1.9cm) and pH using a weighted average model (RMSEPboot 0.4). The reconstructed 23 \n 6\nvalues are termed testate amoebae inferred depth to water table (TI-DWT) and testate 1 \namoebae inferred pH (TI-pH). Bootstrapped error estimation with 1000 cycles was used 2 \nto provide sample-specific error estimates.  3 \n 4 \nChronology 5 \nEstablishing reliable chronologies for recent peat deposits has been a persistent 6 \nchallenge for peatland palaeoecologists (Turetsky et al., 2004) and is particularly 7 \nproblematic for these sites as they are non-ombrotrophic and include unusual plant 8 \ncommunities. A search for cryptotephras (following the method of Pilcher and Hall, 9 \n1992) failed to identify any shards and a search for spheroidal carbonaceous particles 10 \n(following the method of Rose et al, 1995) failed to find adequate concentrations. Two 11 \nradiometric methods, 210Pb and 14C analysis were applied to the peat profiles.  210Pb was 12 \nanalysed by assuming equilibrium with its grand-daughter 210Po. Peat samples were 13 \ndissolved in strong acids with a 209Po yield tracer, plated onto copper disks and activity 14 \nmeasured by \u03b1-spectrometry. Four samples from towards the base of the monoliths were 15 \nAMS radiocarbon dated (Goodsite et al, 2001; Goslar et al, 2005). Bulk samples were 16 \nused due to the absence of Sphagnum (Nilsson et al. 2001). Samples were carefully 17 \nprepared to minimise risk of external contamination and rootlets were picked out.  18 \n 19 \nRESULTS 20 \nTestate amoebae 21 \nTestate amoebae were found through the length of the monoliths but apparent 22 \nconcentrations were low (counting time approximately 6-8 hours per sample). The three 23 \n 7\ntestate amoebae diagrams show similar trends (Fig. 2). At the base of the profiles (zones 1 \nDE-1, KB1-1 and the lower portion of KB2-1) the community composition is noted by 2 \nabundant Difflugia spp., particularly Difflugia pulex type. Above this section there is a 3 \ndecline in these taxa leading to a more diverse community noted by Centropyxis 4 \naerophila (zones DE-2, KB1-2 and the upper portion of KB2-1). The next significant 5 \nchange is a marked increase in Euglypha rotunda, and in KB1, Euglypha ciliata type. The 6 \nuppermost samples are different from those directly below, recognized as a separate zone 7 \nin KB2 (zone KB2-3) and DE (zone DE-3).  8 \nOverlap between the palaeoecological data and the modern training set is very 9 \ngood. Over 99% of all amoebae counted are included in the training set; the total for 10 \nindividual samples does not fall below 97%. Water table reconstructions show a similar 11 \npattern between sites (Fig. 3). From the base of the sequences to c.6 cm depth there is low 12 \namplitude variability with no obvious similarity between profiles. At 6 cm there is a rapid 13 \nincrease in values that significantly exceeds bootstrapped error estimates, representing a 14 \nsignificant lowering of water table in all sites. At the top of the sequence there is a slight 15 \ndecline in TI-DWT values and then a resumed increase in sites KB1 and DE, although 16 \nthere is a continued decline in site KB2. pH reconstructions show gradual lowering of pH 17 \nvalues, increasing in rate above c.6 cm. The changes in pH are less pronounced than 18 \nthose in DWT and (particularly in KB2) only marginally exceed the error estimates.  19 \nThe main amoebae community change is a shift in the most abundant taxon to 20 \nEuglypha rotunda from Centropyxis aerophila type and Difflugia pulex type. C. 21 \naerophila is generally regarded as typical of moderately wet conditions, while E. rotunda 22 \nis probably most typical of intermediate conditions (Charman et al., 2000). The indicator 23 \n 8\nvalue of D. pulex type is uncertain. The majority of transfer functions to encounter both 1 \ntaxa show E. rotunda to have a higher DWT optimum than C. aerophila type (or 2 \nequivalent C. cassis type) (Payne et al., 2006; 2007; in press; Woodland et al., 1998; 3 \nCharman and Warner, 1997; Charman, 1997; Warner and Charman, 1994; Lamentowicz 4 \nand Mitchell, 2005). The transfer function results therefore agree with the known 5 \nautecology of the taxa in interpreting this change as a shift to drier conditions. 6 \n 7 \nChronology 8 \nThe 210Pb results show no decline in activity with depth and a sequence of peaks 9 \nand troughs (Fig. 4). It was not possible to determine the \u201cunsupported\u201d component of the 10 \n210Pb; insufficient material was available for direct 226Ra analysis and the base of the 11 \nunsupported layer was not reached. The lack of a monotonic decrease in activity with 12 \ndepth undermines the attempt to use the method for dating. There are two possible causes 13 \nof these results; very rapid peat accumulation, as suggested by the radiocarbon dates, and 14 \nmovement of lead within the peat profile given the minerotrophic nature of the sites 15 \n(MacKenzie et al., 1998).   16 \nRadiocarbon dates were all returned as post-bomb and calibrated using CaliBomb 17 \n(http:\/\/calib.qub.ac.uk\/CALIBomb\/frameset.html). All dates give multimodal probability 18 \ndistributions ranging from the mid-1950s to post-1995, indicating rapid peat 19 \naccumulation (Table 1). As the dates were based on bulk samples it is possible that they 20 \nhave been contaminated by modern carbon, perhaps through penetration by sedge roots. 21 \nHowever, the samples were prepared carefully to avoid contamination and obvious roots 22 \nwere removed. Systematic differences between dates on bulk samples and selected 23 \n 9\nmacrofossils have not been proven (Blaauw et al. 2004). The dates are internally 1 \nconsistent in showing the peats to be late 20th century in age and are not contradicted by a 2 \ndate of 100\u00b140 14C yrs BP at 31-36 cm from a neighbouring site (Papazisimou et al., 3 \n2002). For two samples from the KB2 monolith, the deeper sample (GdA-1178: 21-4 \n24cm) has a highest probability peak more recent than the upper sample (GdA-1016: 13-5 \n15cm). However this date also has a subsidiary probability peak at 1957-1958 (10.3%). 6 \nAs there is no stratigraphic reason to suspect a reversal it seems more likely that this 7 \nolder peak is the correct one.  8 \n Neither the 210Pb results nor the radiocarbon dates allow us to establish a secure 9 \nchronology for these profiles. However both sets of results can be taken to suggest that 10 \nthe sediments are very recent. Most probably these peats have accumulated within the last 11 \nfew decades but it is not possible to be more precise. Nevertheless, there is no reason to 12 \nsuspect disturbance of the stratigraphy and it is still probable that these profiles do 13 \npreserve a continuous record of testate amoebae changes and may reveal recent 14 \nhydrological changes in the mires.  15 \n 16 \nDISCUSSION 17 \n 18 \n The testate amoebae results show a single large change in amoebae community at 19 \naround 6 cm depth which can be inferred as a shift to a drier mire surface. This is entirely 20 \nconsistent with the hypothesis of a lowered water table due to the general reduction in 21 \nprecipitation in northern Greece. However simple attribution of the changes to a climatic 22 \n 10\nimpact is not possible due to the presence of other factors which could also be responsible 1 \nfor these changes.  2 \n 3 \n1.   Non-climatic hydrological change 4 \nIt seems probable that the Elatia Mires have undergone hydrological change; 5 \nhowever as the sites are not ombrotrophic it is possible that this is unrelated to climate. It 6 \nis possible that processes such as forestry, tectonic or geomorphological change in the 7 \nwider area could have lead to a change in water input into the mires. Although there is no 8 \nparticular evidence to suggest that this may be the case the hypothesis cannot be 9 \ndiscounted on the basis of the data presented here.  10 \n 11 \n2. Vertical zonation of living amoebae 12 \nInterpretation of the uppermost testate amoebae assemblages may be complicated 13 \nif the amoebae are still alive below the surface. Testate amoebae have been noted to 14 \nexhibit vertical zonation forced by gradients in light, moisture and mineral material for 15 \ntest construction (Heal, 1962; Booth 2002; Mitchell and Gilbert 2004; Mazei et al. 2007). 16 \nIt is not clear that vertical zonation could explain the species changes observed. Taxa 17 \nwith xenosome tests such as Difflugia spp. and C. aerophila are commonly observed in 18 \nlower horizons, probably due to availability of material for test construction. However the 19 \ntypical position of Euglypha species varies between studies (Chacharonis 1956; Booth 20 \n2002; Mitchell and Gilbert 2004; Mazei and Bobnova 2007). The only study in 21 \ntransitional mires (Mazei and Bobnova 2007) found vertical zonation to be much weaker 22 \nthan in bogs. In these sites alive or encysted amoebae were only noted in the top 2-3 cm. 23 \n 11\nIt is probable that vertical zonation in this region could explain the unusual communities 1 \nin the uppermost samples, but unlikely that vertical zonation is the cause of the major 2 \nchange at 6cm.  3 \n 4 \n3.   Test preservation 5 \nThe taxa which are primarily responsible for the increase in TI-DWT in the upper 6 \nportions of the sequence (E.rotunda, E.ciliata, C.dubium) all have tests constructed of 7 \nidiosomes. Such tests may be particularly prone to decomposition in the fossil record 8 \n(Lousier and Parkinson, 1981; Swindles and Roe, 2007; Payne 2007). Selective test loss 9 \ncould have led to inaccurate palaeoenvironmental reconstruction in these sites (Mitchell 10 \net al. 2008). A number of strands of evidence suggest this is unlikely to be the major 11 \ncause of the changes: 1) during microscopy no apparent reduction in overall test 12 \nconcentrations was noted with depth (although concentrations were not enumerated), this 13 \nmight be expected given the high proportion of idiosome tests; 2) no increase in degraded 14 \ntests was noted with depth; 3) the taxa concerned decline sharply at around 6 cm, 15 \nhowever they continue through the rest of the profiles in lower concentrations; 4) other 16 \nclosely related taxa reach their highest concentrations lower in the profiles (e.g. 17 \nE.tuberculata in KB1); 5) the timescale under consideration is very short so differential 18 \npreservation is perhaps less likely than in longer-term studies; 6) when Euglypha is 19 \nremoved from the reconstructions an increase in TI-DWT at 6cm remains (Fig. 3), 20 \nalthough this is less marked and there are other changes such as a large drop in TI-DWT 21 \nat the top of KB1.   22 \n 23 \n 12\n4.    Autogenic mire development processes 1 \nThe Elatia mires have been termed \u2018transitional\u2019 between fens and bogs; it is 2 \npossible that the changes in the palaeoecological record are due to ombrotrophication. 3 \nOmbrotrophication can be expected to lead to major amoebae community changes as fens 4 \nhave distinctly different testate amoebae communities from bogs and nutrient status is an 5 \nimportant secondary gradient (Opravilova and Hajek, 2006).  6 \nConventionally it has been assumed that an autogenic mechanism drives 7 \nombrotrophication; peat gradually accumulates above the water table until it is no longer 8 \nreliant on groundwater and becomes acidified by leaching and the establishment of 9 \nSphagnum (Hughes, 2000). This would sit well with the reconstructed increase in TI-10 \nDWT and slight decrease in TI-pH. However, it seems unlikely that this autogenic model 11 \ncould explain the suddenness of the amoebae change, the 2cm+ offset between 12 \nstratigraphic and amoebae community changes and the apparent synchroneity in change 13 \nbetween two sites. More recent studies have suggested allogenic forcing of 14 \nombrotrophication with a lowered water table leading to the peat surface being separated 15 \nfrom groundwater  (Hughes, 2000; Hughes and Dumayne-Peaty, 2002; Hughes and 16 \nBarber, 2003; Hughes et al., 2000). It is therefore also possible that ombrotrophication is 17 \noccurring, but is driven by a real allogenic change.  18 \n 19 \nThe results presented here are consistent with the hypothesis of a climate change-20 \ninduced hydrological change; however other explanations cannot be excluded. It is 21 \npossible that multiple processes have lead to the observed patterns. If the changes are due 22 \nto climate then this study provides the first evidence for the impacts of recent climate 23 \n 13\nchange on Mediterranean peatlands. Climate change is likely to be a key challenge to 1 \nregional peatland conservation.  2 \n 3 \nAcknowledgements 4 \n 5 \nThis study was primarily funded by a BSA MacMillan-Rodewald fellowship to RJP.  6 \nRadiocarbon dates were funded by grants from the Richard Bradford McConnell Fund 7 \nand a Gladstone Memorial Prize.
