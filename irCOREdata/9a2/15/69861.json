It is argued that the changes can be explained in terms of a number of regulatory dilemmas which emerged or were intensified under neo-liberal capital accumulation. Some of the regulatory dilemmas \u2013 high levels of economic inactivity, inflationary pressures consequent to higher employment and low levels of wages \u2013 it was thought could be managed through the social security system using what we call \u2018market workfare\u2019; by which we mean in-work means-tested social security benefits which have some measure of compulsion to work attached, such that it counts as workfare.

However,\nwith labour market flexibility becoming defined as the route to full\nemployment, the social security system became captured in a discourse\nwhich suggested that the system itself was a barrier to greater levels of\nemployment and economic prosperity.\nThe aim of this article is to discuss the strategy for change within the\nsocial security system inaugurated by the parliamentary neo-liberal right,\nthrough which it was hoped that neo-liberal capital accumulation would\nbe buttressed. More specifically, our emphasis is upon understanding the\nrestructuring of the benefit system towards the \u2018pivotal position in British\nsocial security provision\u2019 (Walker, 1994, p. 171) which Family Credit\n(and Earnings Top-up) was to occupy under the former parliamentary\nneo-liberal Conservative (1992\u20137) government. Towards the end of the\narticle we also discuss the New Labour government\u2019s project which takes\nforward in-work benefits as \u2018welfare-to-work\u2019.\nT H E R E G U L AT I O N A P P ROA C H A N D S O C I A L P O L I C Y\nPenna and O\u2019Brien (1996, pp. 46\u201350) demonstrate the usefulness of\nRegulation Approach (RA) analysis in the study of social policy. Their\ncomments were informed by Jessop (1991a, b, 1994a, b; also see Peck\nand Jones, 1995; Peck, 1996) whose recent work on the shift from the\nKeynesian Welfare State (KWS) to the Schumpeterian Workfare State\n(SWS), having been critically reviewed in a collection by Burrows and\nLoader (1994), seems to have had little impact on social policy analyses.\nWe suggest that even if the idea of a tendential shift from the KWS to the\nSWS is deemed to be of little use, RA analysis on which Jessop\u2019s ideas are\nbased, does provide a useful framework for analysing recent shifts in\nsocial security policy. Our focus is upon the shift form the Beveridgean\nnotion of contingency benefits of non-employment to the more recent\nemphasis from both the parliamentary right and left of the importance of\nsocial security benefits in the transition from welfare, into work.\nThe RA emerged as an explanatory framework because of important\nquestions facing Marxists in the 1970s concerning the way in which\ncrises of capital accumulation are managed and how capital accumula-\ntion can proceed with relative stability over the long term (Boyer, 1990).\nThere are two concepts central to the RA: the accumulation regime and the\nsocial mode of economic regulation. The accumulation regime consists of the\n\u2018macro-economic regime sustaining growth in capitalist production and\nconsumption\u2019 (Jessop, 1994a, p. 14). The social mode of economic regula-\n74 Chris Grover and John Stewart\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\ntion represents \u2018an ensemble of norms, institutions, organisational forms,\nsocial networks, and patterns of contact which sustain and \u201cguide\u201d a\ngiven accumulation regime\u2019 (ibid.). The central thesis of the RA is that\nwithout a congruent social mode of economic regulation, a given accumula-\ntion regime will falter, resulting in a conjunctural (or major) crisis of capi-\ntal accumulation. Such crises were witnessed in the 1930s and 1970s\n(Lipietz, 1987, p. 34). A central element of the social mode of economic \nregulation is social policy (Jessop, 1991a, p. 86). Hence, in contrast to\ninterpretations of social policy as being concerned with the \u2018needs\u2019 of\nindividuals or families, in RA analyses, policies become an important\ninstrument in the governing of capital accumulation (ibid.; also Penna\nand O\u2019Brien, 1996, p. 47).\nJessop argues that in the early 1980s a \u2018ground-clearing\u2019 operation\noccurred, leaving the way clear for Britain to establish a neo-liberal accu-\nmulation regime through late 1980s \u2018radical Thatcherism\u2019. The neo-lib-\neral accumulation regime, Jessop (1991b) claims was highlighted by char-\nacteristics which included \u2018liberalization, promoting (the) free market\u2019;\n\u2018deregulation, giving economic agents greater freedom from state con-\ntrol\u2019; \u2018internationalization, encouraging the mobility of capital and\nlabour, stimulating global markets\u2019 (pps. 146, 147). It is our contention\nthat New Labour\u2019s embrace of the \u2018free market\u2019, global capitalism and\n\u2018flexibility\u2019 (Brown, 1994; Labour Party, 1995, 1997, p. 15) suggests that\nthe accumulation regime has changed little (rather unsurprisingly) under\nthe New Labour government.\nHowever, as we have seen, the accumulation regime is only one of the\ncentral concepts in RA analyses. This article goes on to outline develop-\nments in social security policy as an important element of the social mode\nof economic regulation. These developments, the parliamentary neo-liberal\nright hoped, would buttress and help reproduce the neo-liberal accumula-\ntion regime. We then discuss policy changes \u2013 in particular the emphasis\nupon welfare-to-work \u2013 of the \u2018new deal\u2019 for the unemployed and lone\nmothers as outlined by the New Labour government in its formative\nmonths in office since winning the general election of May 1997.\n\u2018Workfare\u2019 has been at the centre of debates on social security for the\npast decade. While both the parliamentary neo-liberal right and the par-\nliamentary left have, in the past, denied any interest in developing work-\nfare policies, or have been critical of such policies1, there has been much\nmedia excitement over the possibility of wholesale workfare being intro-\nduced into British social security. However, workfare induces media\nexcitement in almost inverse proportion to the clarity of the concept. It is\nunclear what is actually meant by the term; what its objectives are; and\n\u2018Market Workfare\u2019 75\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nhence how it is supposed to meet those objectives (for discussion of the\netymology of workfare see Peck, 1998).\nD E F I N I N G W O R K FA R E\nWhilst the term \u2018workfare\u2019 conjures up images of coercing into employ-\nment all kinds of people who are not working, the concept is actually\nused in a variety of other ways. In particular, workfare needs to be distin-\nguished from stringent qualifying criteria for relief during periods of\nlabour market inactivity (Costello, 1993). Many commentators assume\nthe idea of coercing benefit-dependent people into work or training in\norder to receive their entitlements equates with workfare (Walker 1991,\np. 1; Musgrove 1991, p. 1). We refer to such an approach as \u2018traditional\nworkfare\u2019. The implication is that the unemployed would otherwise be\nlazy, idle scroungers and need the benefit regime to remind them \nsharply of the discipline of the market. The arguments of Lawrence Mead\n(1992), for example, reflect this \u2018traditional workfare\u2019 approach. Mead\nargues that due to the withdrawal from, and evasion of, employment by\nthe dependent poor, they need to be placed upon a trajectory to indepen-\ndence through the compulsion of workfare schemes (ibid., p. 172; see also\nDeacon, 1997 for a useful summary of Mead\u2019s arguments).\nSuch broad definitions, however, have limited the conceptual value of\nworkfare, for used in that way workfare could be a description of most\nsocial security systems requiring the users to actively search for employ-\nment on the threat of benefit withdrawal. Furthermore, such definitions\nmiss the point that, in contrast to merely providing benefit-dependent\npeople with some form of employment, workfare is really about creating\nmore employment. Hence, we believe that Costello\u2019s (1993) definition of\nworkfare is more useful. She notes: \u2018An operational definition of workfare\nmight be that it forces people to take jobs or forms of training on the job\nwhich pay less than the current market rate for the same kind of work\u2019 (p. 2).\nThis conceptualisation of workfare is useful because it highlights two\naspects of workfare: its coercive nature; and, more importantly, it identi-\nfies the objective of workfare as depressing wage levels. Workfare, she\nsuggests, depresses wage levels by increasing the supply of potential\nemployees who are under the threat of benefit withdrawal. Workfare\ninduces people to accept lower paid jobs than they would have done if\n\u2018passive\u2019 cash benefits had been available, because the prospect of having\nto accept a training place or job at less than normal wages deters them\nfrom remaining unemployed. Hence, the theory goes, because labour is\ncheaper, employers will be able to employ more people, thereby reducing\nunemployment. Arguing from Costello\u2019s account, with the example of\n76 Chris Grover and John Stewart\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nthe Conservative government\u2019s in-work benefits we believe the term \u2018mar-\nket workfare\u2019 is more appropriate. We use the word \u2018workfare\u2019 because of\nthe coercion to find work introduced with Job Seeker\u2019s Allowance (and\npossibly Parents Plus); \u2018market\u2019 because it is existing and newly created\nemployment in the market which is being filled by those moving from\nout-of-work benefits, to in-work benefits. Hence, and in contrast to \u2018tradi-\ntional\u2019 notions of workfare, government has little need to create employ-\nment, thus satisfying the parliamentary neo-liberal Right of the last\nConservative administration. It would seem that the New Deal of the\nLabour government (elected in May 1997) develops further this line of\nthinking in social security, as we explain below.\nW O R K FA R E A N D T H E PA R L I A M E N TA RY N E O - L I B E R A L R I G H T\nDespite the plethora of schemes aimed at disciplining the unemployed in\nthe ways of the market which emerged during the reign of the parliamen-\ntary neo-liberal right, it might be a surprise to learn that the \u2018right\u2019 were\nopposed to the notion of traditional workfare. So, for example, in giving\nevidence to the Employment Select Committee, Anne Widdecombe (then\nminister of state for employment) argued how: \u2018Workfare as I defined it\nbefore this committee \u2013 and my definition was a large scale, national\nscheme, probably compulsory and in return for benefits \u2013 is not on our\nagenda\u2019 (Employment Committee, 1994, question 51).\nThe objections cited to traditional workfare included cost and a fear of\na displacement and substitution of \u2018market\u2019 jobs with state-created or\nfunded employment (ibid., questions 62, 72). Underpinning such contin-\ngent objections was the neo-liberal belief that only the free market can be\nthe begetter of genuine employment and wealth creation (cf. Hayek,\n1944, 1975, 1980). As David Willetts told Parliament, the state cannot\nplan for such things:\nOf course it is frustrating when one sees idle hands when there is unmet need, but it is not\nthe job of the state to make those idle hands meet those unmet needs; it is the job of a\nproperly operating labour market. It is not an enormous command economy directing\npeople into jobs that politicians decide are useful. That is not how a free economy works.\n(HC Debate, 20 Nov. 1992, col. 532)\nFor Willetts \u2013 then Conservative MP for Havant and intellectual inspi-\nration for the parliamentary neo-liberal right2 (Willetts, 1992, 1994) \u2013\nemployment creation is not something in which the state can legitimately\nbecome embroiled:\nThe Government have enormous responsibilities in terms of employment and the labour\nmarket. The Government\u2019s responsibility is, first, to ensure that there is the right eco-\n\u2018Market Workfare\u2019 77\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nnomic framework \u2026 Another responsibility of government is to ensure that the labour\nmarket works properly \u2026 It is a responsibility which calls for supply-side reforms, which\nthe Government pursued in the 1980s. I hope that they will continue in the 1990s \u2026 I do\nnot think that the Government have a direct r\u00f4le to intervene in and run the labour mar-\nket, and themselves to link idle hands and unmet needs by employing millions of people\nwho would otherwise be unemployed. (HC Debate, 20 Nov. 1992, col. 538).\nEssentially, \u2018traditional workfare\u2019 in the form of make-work schemes was\nanathema to the parliamentary neo-liberal right, who suggested that\nlegitimate state intervention in the market should be reserved for ensur-\ning a stable economic environment to facilitate economic growth and job\ncreation, while developing supply-side measures to ensure people can and\nwill work when their labour is demanded by the market. Such measures\nincluded ensuring that incentives to work exist, that the unemployed\nwere available for work; and that the unemployed were actively seeking\nemployment (Willetts, HC Debate, 20 Nov. 1992, cols. 529\u201330;\nWiddecombe, Employment Committee, 1994, questions 15, 27). Support\nfor the development of Family Credit; tightening the availability for work\nprovisions; and tightening the \u2018actively seeking work provisions\u2019 were\nlegitimised through such reasoning (Willetts in HC Debate, 20 Nov.\n1992, cols., 529\u201330). A distinction was also being made between testing\nunemployment (actively seeking and availability for work) and subsidis-\ning low wages through in-work benefits. In fact, because it is difficult to\nhave the latter without the former, we can begin to see support for a pol-\nicy which looks more like workfare as defined by Costello. As importantly,\nit is also clear that the creation of \u2018traditional workfare\u2019 is believed to be\nan inhibitor of competitiveness.\nS O C I A L S E C U R I T Y I N T H E 1 9 9 0 S\nAt the core of the neo-liberal right\u2019s attitude there was a paradox: on the\none hand, for many years it was argued that the post-war welfare state\nwas a barrier to economic growth and enterprise through having a detri-\nmental effect on individual responsibility and morality (Boyson, 1971,\n1978; Miller and Wood, 1982; Murray 1990, 1994; Lilley, 1993). On the\nother hand, social security policy was interpreted as being a useful mech-\nanism in an increasingly competitive global market. The competitiveness\nWhite Papers (DTI et al., 1994, 1995, 1996), for instance, highlighted\nhow recent initiatives in social security policy would, it was thought, aid\nlabour market performance: \u2018The Government\u2019s employment and labour\nmarket policies aim to support economic growth by promoting a competi-\ntive, efficient and flexible labour market\u2019, (DT et al., 1995, p. 101). Such a\nlabour market would be one in which \u2018unemployed people are helped and\n78 Chris Grover and John Stewart\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nencouraged to compete effectively for jobs\u2019 and \u2018the benefits system pro-\nvides people with incentives to work\u2019 (ibid.).\nThe seeming concordance between employment policy and social secu-\nrity administration was important, for it was clear that the objection of\nthe parliamentary neo-liberal right was not to social security per se, but\nto certain forms of social security. Indeed, after Lilley\u2019s inauguration as\nthe secretary of state for social security (1992) there was an increasing\nfocus on, and interest in, the ways in which social security benefits inter-\nacted with the labour market and labour market policy. One civil\nservant3, for instance, noted how in the Department of Social Security: \u2018I\nsuppose it was really probably until Mr Lilley arrived \u2013 we had not really\nseen ourselves as having a strong interest in labour market policies\u2026\u2019\nIn RA terms the focus upon the relationship between the labour mar-\nket and social security policy goes some way to help explain the very\nrapid period of change which has been witnessed in social security policy\nsince the early 1990s. It was hoped that the development of \u2018market\nworkfare\u2019 would help overcome some of what RA analysts describe as\n\u2018regulatory dilemmas\u2019 of neo-liberal capital accumulation. Because RA\nanalysts see the reproduction of capital accumulation as being a socially\nembedded process, the social regulation of the labour market comes in\nmany, varied forms \u2018ranging from formal labor [sic] law to socially embed-\nded work norms, from employers discrimination to union action\u2019 (Peck,\n1996, p. 11). Hence, in RA analyses when there is seemingly a problem\nin the labour market (for example, high unemployment or low wages), it\nis conceptualised not as a mismatch between supply and demand, but a\n\u2018regulatory dilemma\u2019 which reflects the complexities of the social regula-\ntion of labour (ibid., p. 17). Labour market \u2018problems\u2019 therefore are the\nresult of the myriad of often contradictory socially and institutionally\nembedded regulatory forms. The term \u2018regulatory dilemma\u2019 also reflects\nthe fact that there is a diversity of responses which social regulators may\ntry to implement. Overcoming labour market problems therefore is seen\nas a dilemma, rather than a case of clear-cut answers.\nThere were, in fact, two important strands in the development of \nneo-liberal \u2018market workfare\u2019 as an attempt to manage the regulatory\ndilemmas of neo-liberal capital accumulation: out-of-work benefits and\nin-work benefits.\nOut-of-work benefits \nUnder the Conservative administration, subtle changes occurred in bene-\nfits for lone mothers, the result of which has been the increasing com-\nmodification of the \u2018formal\u2019 labour of lone mothers. Although the familial\n\u2018Market Workfare\u2019 79\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nideological basis of policies such as the Child Support Agency (CSA) has\nbeen widely commented on (for critical discussion see Smart, 1987;\nAbbott and Wallace, 1992; Lister, 1994; Millar, 1994), arguably one of\nthe earliest indications of changing policies towards lone mothers was to\nbe found in the debate and legislation concerning the employment related\naspects of the CSA. The interaction between in-work benefits and child\nmaintenance were seen as important determinants in encouraging lone\nmothers back into work through FC: \nReceiving maintenance in itself makes it easier to go to work. Maintenance payments are\nincome which the caring parent receives in any circumstances. So, it is a \u201cportable\nincome\u201d. It is additional to earnings. Receiving maintenance can also help to make the\ntransition from Income Support into work easier. (Lord Chancellor\u2019s Department et al.,\n1990, p. 41)\nThe underpinnings of the CSA were as much concerned with labour dis-\ncipline, as familial ideology. The Lord Chancellor\u2019s Department was sug-\ngesting that women living on their own who care for their children are at\nleast available for work if not \u2018technically\u2019 unemployed. So, maintenance\nwas defined as a \u2018portable\u2019 income which is of more benefit to mothers if\nthey are in employment, even if they are in receipt of FC. The \u2018official line\u2019\nwas that whilst such measures may be beneficial to lone mothers wishing\nto return to employment, whether they actually did so was their choice\n(ibid.; also see the comments of Tony Newton, then secretary of state for\nsocial security, HC Debate, 29 Oct. 1990, col. 731). \nDebates about lone mothers moving into employment via in-work \nbenefits through exercising their own choices came before 1993: \u2018the year of\nthe lone parent\u2019 (Mann and Roseneil, 1994; Roseneil and Mann, 1996).\nThe emphasis since then has been on encouraging lone mothers to leave\nfull benefit dependency and take employment without making them sign\non as unemployed.\nThe piloting of the Parents Plus (PP) scheme (DSS press releases\n96\/202; 96\/266) operationalised this employment focus by putting lone\nmothers in contact with the labour market. The Benefits Agency claim\nthat \u2018no pressure will be put upon those who do not wish to look for\nwork, but the case workers will ask them why [they do not want to work].\nThis would identify any barriers to employment\u2019 (Touchbase, 96\/97, no.\n7, p. 2). In the context of savage ministerial and media condemnation of\nlone motherhood, however, such disclaimers about coercion seem feeble,\nfor pressure already exists upon lone mothers to leave benefit dependency\nthrough the stigma of being labelled as feckless scroungers, responsible\nfor breeding irresponsible and delinquent children (cf. Lilley, 1992;\nRedwood, 1993; note also Labour party, 1997, p. 25; Frank Field\u2019s \u2018men-\n80 Chris Grover and John Stewart\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\ntor proposals\u2019 for potential young never-married mothers as long-term\ndependants upon the state, BBC Radio 4, PM programme, 11 Aug.\n1997). Indeed, whilst the erosion of benefits for lone mothers aims to\nmake them economically \u2018less eligible\u2019, the stigmatisation of lone mothers\nis aimed at making them \u2018socially less eligible\u2019 (cf. Ginsburg, 1979, p. 48).\nMoreover, evidence suggests that lone mothers would prefer to be finan-\ncially independent of the benefit system, but economic barriers to moving\ninto employment, such as a lack of affordable child care are often difficult\nto negotiate (Marsh and McKay, 1993; McKay and Marsh, 1994; Ford et\nal., 1995). In addition, decisions for lone mothers to work cannot be\ndivorced from \u2018gendered moral rationalities\u2019 of how they \u2018hold under-\nstandings about their identity as mothers, and as lone mothers in partic-\nular, and their responsibilities towards their children\u2019 (Edwards and\nDuncan, 1996a, p. 5; 1996b).\nTurning to those people \u2018technically\u2019 defined as unemployed by the\nstate, the most fundamental change to affect unemployed claimants since\nthe conception of the post-war welfare state was the implementation in\nOctober 1996 of the Job Seeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA). The most important\naspect of the JSA from our perspective is its attempt to \u2018improve the opera-\ntion of the labour market\u2019 (DE & DSS, 1994, p. 5), for: \u2018The legislation\nwill\u2026 improve incentives to work, remove barriers that discourage people\nfrom leaving benefit and focus the efforts on looking for work\u2019 (Michael\nPortillo, then secretary of state for employment, HC Debate, 10 Jan.\n1995, col. 47). Broadly speaking, the JSA does not allow applicants to\nrefuse jobs on the grounds of hours, wages or conditions of employment.\nMoreover claimants cannot determine a minimum wage for which they\nare willing to work without risking an accusation of not being available\nfor work. To confirm such details, claimants must sign a Jobseeker\u2019s\nAgreement which inter alia covers any restrictions on hours or pattern of\navailability, type of work, action to be taken to seek work and improve\nprospects. Restrictions and refusals may result in benefit suspensions (see\nMurray, 1996; Finn, 1997).\nEssentially the JSA is an elaborate mechanism for ensuring that the\ndiscipline of the market is rigorously enforced, and that the level of bene-\nfits do not provide an incentive to become or remain unemployed. In fact,\nthe restructuring of unemployment benefits are closely linked to increas-\ningly flexible labour market change: \u2018The basic condition for benefit\nreceipt \u2013 that individuals should be available for and actively seeking\nwork \u2013 will be better attuned to the conditions of the labour market\u2019 (DSS,\n1995, p. 9).\nWhat is clear from the discussion of policy initiatives for lone mothers\n\u2018Market Workfare\u2019 81\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nand unemployed claimants under the parliamentary neo-liberal right is\nthat the emphasis was upon \u2018encouraging\u2019, (with various degrees of coer-\ncion), benefit-dependent people to take employment. However, the new\npolicy thrust eschewed the old-fashioned \u2018contingency\u2019 approach of the\nBeveridge tradition, instead seeking a rapprochement between social secu-\nrity and free enterprise in an attempt to manage some of the dilemmas of\nneo-liberal accumulation.\nIn-work benefits\nFamily Credit (FC) was introduced as part of the 1986 Fowler Reforms. Its\npurpose is to supplement the income of people, with dependent children,\nworking full time4 who are deemed to be in receipt of low wages. The\nrationale for the introduction of FC was an attempt to tackle the \u2018poverty\ntrap\u2019 and hence \u2018avoid the position, which can occur now where net fam-\nily income can be reduced as earnings rise over significant ranges of earn-\nings\u2019 and to \u2018ensure that families do not find themselves worse off in work\nthan they would be if they are not working\u2019 (DHSS, 1985, para. 4.46). FC\ntherefore was presented as an incentive measure aimed at encouraging\npeople to take low paid employment by attempting to ensure that they\nwill have a higher income in work, compared with their benefit income.\nFC also tries to ensure that families keep increases in their earned income\nonce they are in employment by not clawing back benefit against wage\nincrease pound for pound5. Hence FC should make even the lowest paid\nemployment more financially attractive \u2013 so long as the prospective entry\nlevel worker has children. Although progress has been slow, take-up of FC\nhas improved so that by February 1997 over 730,000 families with\ndependent children were in receipt of FC (DSS press release 97\/108).\nAll the considerations which apply to families with children about\n\u2018entry level\u2019 low wages and consequent differentials in relation to benefit\nincome also apply, in an economic sense, to childless couples and single\npeople. The only justification for restricting FC to families with children\nfirst has to be primarily political. It could be that there is a judgement\nabout children as innocent parties who should not bear too directly the\nburden of poverty visited upon their unemployed parents \u2013 though the\nmore likely reason is that the extra dependants\u2019 allowances which chil-\ndren attract have to be off-set to make low-wage work attractive! Enter\nthe Earnings Top-up (ETU) pilot scheme, as the measure announced in\nthe 1994 Budget to manage the dilemma for childless couples and single\npeople (DSS, 1995).\nETU is paid on similar grounds to FC and its objectives are similar, to\nmake low paying employment more financially attractive by subsiding\n82 Chris Grover and John Stewart\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nwage levels: \u2018The pilot of the Earnings Top-up aims to overcome the disin-\ncentive to work inherent in any social security system, especially for\nthose with limited earning power\u2019 (ibid., 1995, p. 2). The implications are\nclear. Entitlements to out-of-work benefits inherently contain disincen-\ntives which are likely to be greatest for those who can normally expect to\nearn low wages.\nThe take-up of ETU has been rapid. Just four months after its launch in\nOctober 1996, it was announced that \u2018over 7,500 people are now benefit-\ning from this new initiative\u2019 and that it \u2018was estimated that 20,000 peo-\nple would be in receipt of ETU by the end of the three year pilot and, on\ncurrent trends, it is likely that this target will be achieved easily\u2019 (DSS\npress release, 97\/026).\nT H E R E L AT I O N S H I P B E T W E E N I N - W O R K A N D O U T- O F - W O R K\nB E N E F I T S :  M A R K E T W O R K FA R E\nUnder the previous Conservative administration we witnessed the initial\nstages of an important transition in the objectives of social security.\nPreviously the system had been geared to relieving need on the under-\nstanding that claimants did not do paid work. The Beveridge plan\n(Beveridge, 1942) itself was constructed around contingencies which\ninterrupt the ability to work in the labour market. The main condition for\nthe receipt of benefits was that recipients did not work (very much or at\nall). One civil servant, for example, told us that the thrust of social secu-\nrity was moving:\nmore to saying, \u2018you must do what work you are capable of and we will top up your\nincome a bit\u2019, whereas before it was all or nothing\u2026 it was a condition of being sick or\nunemployed that you did not do any work to get your benefit. That is now changing.\nUnder the parliamentary neo-liberal right, it was increasingly becoming\na condition of benefit receipt that the applicant did some work in the \nmarket. To ensure this happened there was to be an increasingly close\nrelationship between out-of-work and in-work benefits:\nJSA will be part of a more unified system of in-work and out-of-work benefits designed to\nminimise the effects of the \u2018unemployment trap\u2019 and reduce the disincentives for the\nunemployed and their partners to find work. (Department of Trade and Industry et al.,\n1995, p. 107)\nSuch a close relationship between out-of-work and in-work benefits,\nhowever, meant that Britain was rapidly heading towards a situation in\nwhich \u2018market workfare\u2019 was becoming an integral part of the benefit\nsystem. Our notion of \u2018market workfare\u2019 differs subtly from Costello\u2019s\nmodel outlined earlier, for whilst the JSA (and perhaps PP) acts to ensure\n\u2018Market Workfare\u2019 83\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nthere is a pool of labour to fill available vacancies, the dynamics of in-\nwork benefits, as we shall see, were being deliberately engineered to fur-\nther reduce wages. We use the term \u2018market workfare\u2019 because it is not\nthe government who are creating the employment on which this system\nof workfare is dependent. We have seen that the parliamentary neo-\nliberal right were opposed to the idea of traditional workfare because of\nthe role the state would have in such schemes and the alleged distortions\nwhich would be entrained for the market. In market workfare such \nperceived problems do not exist because no demands are made upon \ngovernment to create employment. In contrast, access to employment is\ncontrolled by the market and its agents. The interesting question, which\nwe now turn to is, why has market workfare been developed in the\n1990s?\nM A R K E T W O R K FA R E A N D N E O - L I B E R A L C A P I TA L A C C U M U L AT I O N\nWe have seen that in RA analyses the accumulation regime has to be\n\u2018guided\u2019 by a congruent social mode of economic regulation if that regime is\nto be reproduced. It is our contention that the development of market\nworkfare was part of the development of a neo-liberal social mode of eco-\nnomic regulation, for it was hoped (there can be no guarantees as the social\nmode of economic regulation is never complete and constantly changing)\nthat in-work benefits would overcome some of the regulatory dilemmas of\nneo-liberal capital accumulation. Despite a discourse that suggested that\ntheir aim was to reduce as far as possible the role of the state in the provi-\nsion of social security benefits, clearly even the parliamentary neo-liberal\nright understood that \u2018the market\u2019 could not be left \u2018free\u2019 from regulation\n(cf. Jessop, 1994a, p. 29, 1994b, p. 267). In fact, with the deregulation\nand liberalisation of the market, several regulatory dilemmas emerged or\nwere intensified, which the state tried to manage through intervention in\nsocial security policy. These problems included: first, stagnantly high\nunemployment among undervalued6 labour, a situation forecast to\nchange little: \nThe main areas of growth are projected to be in managerial, professional and associate\nprofessional jobs. In contrast jobs for craft and skilled manual workers, plant and\nmachine operatives and unskilled labourers will continue to decline. Part-time work will\ncontinue on its strong upward path. (Department of Employment et al., 1992)\nSuch trends have led some commentators to claim there has been a\n\u2018collapse\u2019 in the demand for undervalued (male) labour (Nickell and Bell,\n1995; see also, Balls, 1993; Gregg, 1993), whilst others also note a\nshortening of job tenure for such labour (Burgess and Rees, 1996).\nSecond and relatedly, there was a fear that any employment increases\n84 Chris Grover and John Stewart\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nwould fuel inflation unless the demand for labour was met by an increas-\ning supply of labour seeking employment: \nThe number of people who are competing for jobs and the intensity of their job search\ninfluences labour costs. Weak labour supply leads to inflation rather than more jobs\nwhen output grows. The government has enhanced incentives to work, provided infor-\nmation and active help for unemployed people, discouraged unfair discrimination in the\nlabour market, and removed obstacles to labour mobility. (Department of Trade and\nIndustry et al., 1994, p. 52).\nThird, and perhaps most importantly, the relative wages of underval-\nued labour are falling. This has led to the greatest wage inequality in\nBritain since the 1880s (Balls, 1993, p. 3; Low Pay Unit, 1995, p. 9;\nOsborne and Nichol, 1996, p. 480). These changes in wage differentials\nwere acknowledged even within government. Peter Lilley when secretary\nof state for social security observed:\nThis widening of earning differentials between skilled and unskilled does not just affect\nunemployment. It lies behind, or is intertwined with, many of our social problems. It may\nplay a major part in the break-up of families, the growth of lone parenthood, and a grow-\ning welfare dependency. It may even play a part in explaining delinquency and crime.\n(Lilley, 1994, p. 6)\nThe consequence of widening earning differentials for benefit-depen-\ndent people after nearly two decades of free market policies is that:\nentry positions available to those currently not in employment have become increasingly\nunstable and low paid\u2026 New engagements \u2026 increasingly offer far lower wages relative\nto continuing jobs. Indeed, real earnings in jobs taken by those out of work have barely\nrisen at all since 1980. (Gregg and Wadsworth, 1995a, pp. 73\u20134)\nIndeed, Gregg and Wadsworth suggest that the majority of people on\nbenefits may be discouraged from seeking employment because of a per-\nceived \u2018poverty trap\u2019 as: \u2018Less than one-in-five entry jobs paid above\nmedian weekly earnings, (\u00a3224 per week) while over half paid below half\nmedian, (\u00a3112), and a surprising third paid below a quarter of median\nwages\u2019 (Gregg and Wadsworth, 1995b, p. 211). The aim of in-work bene-\nfits was to re-establish the entry level of low wage labour by offering\n\u2018wage subsidies\u2019 to individuals, encouraging them to take low paid\nemployment. In the words of one civil servant we interviewed, the idea of\nin-work benefits was: \u2018to create a clear blue water\u2026 between what you\ncould get in terms of benefits, and what you would get in work, in terms\nof benefits, income and all the rest\u2019. In-work benefits stand like a buffer\nbetween the expressed needs of the free market in wage labour, and the\nrough and ready notions we have of politically acceptable minimum\n\u2018Market Workfare\u2019 85\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nincomes on benefit and in work. Concern with such issues is not new and\nis, in fact, rooted in the \u2018less eligibility\u2019 of the Benthamite utilitarianism\nwhich still pervades the social security system. Beveridge (Beveridge,\n1944, pp. 92\u20133; see also Squires, 1990, pp. 146\u201358), for example, was so\nconcerned that he had already indicated in his plan that a new benefit \u2013\neventually to be the Family Allowance \u2013 was required to maintain the dif-\nferential. We, however, are more interested in explaining why, in the late\ntwentieth century, governments have deemed it necessary to either sub-\nsidise individuals or employers in the labour market in order to reduce\neconomic inactivity. These approaches to social security are a fundamen-\ntal shift in post-Second World War social security policy. As one civil ser-\nvant informed us: \u2018Beveridge would have been horrified of anything other\nthan Family Allowance in work.\u2019\nThe important point to note is that in-work benefits were seen, cer-\ntainly by the parliamentary neo-liberal right, as the most suitable\nresponse to the regulatory dilemmas inherent in the workings of the free\nmarket because these benefits were designed in a way which it was hoped\nwould aid Britain\u2019s neo-liberal accumulation strategy. So, for instance,\nwhile in-work benefits were an acknowledgement of, and in fact institu-\ntionalised, low (re-)entry wages, there was greater concern with differen-\ntials between \u2018skill\u2019 levels: the argument being that if differentials were\ntoo low Britain\u2019s competitiveness would be compromised: \nreward for skill differentials are lower than in France and Germany. This may explain\nwhy Britain has fewer people qualified at supervisor, foreman and technician levels\nwhich\u2026 is precisely where demand is likely to grow during the 1990s\u2026 Thus pay differ-\nentials are still not sending out clear messages about incentives to train. This is affecting\nboth the willingness of individuals to learn new skills and employers\u2019 willingness to pro-\nvide training opportunities. (Department of Employment et al., 1992, p. 38)\nWhat we have defined as market workfare was seen as an important\npart of the strategy in managing these regulatory dilemmas. In other\nwords, market workfare was a mechanism to help manage the inherent\ncontradictions in an increasingly deregulated and liberalised market.\nHow though, can market workfare be seen as managing the regulatory\ndilemmas outlined above?\nIn the first instance, it was felt that more low paid employment could\nbe created, particularly through the ETU. In the words of one civil ser-\nvant:\nR Well, I mean I have been persuaded it [ETU] won\u2019t work unless it has an effect on\nwages. It depends on how much of an effect on wages.\nCG: So\u2026 a\u2026 degree of effect then, would be acceptable?\n86 Chris Grover and John Stewart\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nR: The argument my economist colleagues use is: since there is no shortage at the bot-\ntom end of the labour market, it is entirely a demand thing. And the only way you\nwill increase demand is by reducing the cost of labour to the employer, and so unless it\ndoes drive wages down a bit, nothing will happen. (our emphasis; respondent was a\nsenior civil servant)\nOne of the aims of the ETU, therefore, was to reduce \u2018market\u2019 wage levels\nin a hope more employment would be created in that undervalued sec-\ntion of the labour market in which demand for labour has collapsed.\nHence, whilst free-marketeers argued that individuals should be paid a\nwage which reflects their productive value, and should not be paid more\nthan this in policies such as a minimum wage (Department of Trade and\nIndustry et al., 1995, p. 110), it is clear that it was acceptable to push\n\u2018market\u2019 wages below the level reflecting the productive value of the indi-\nvidual.\nSecond, and relatedly, \u2018market workfare\u2019 had a role to play in avoiding\nthe inflationary pressures of increasing employment, for it was believed\nthat in-work benefits would increase the supply of labour. One civil ser-\nvant, for example, told us that:\nWhat you are doing if you have in-work benefits is you are essentially lowering the wage\nat which it becomes financially sensible to work. So you are creating a situation where\nmore people want to work at any one wage level because the work is actually worth more\nto them.\nThird, and perhaps most controversially, market workfare was seen as\na mechanism for buttressing Britain\u2019s global competitiveness strategy in\nhigher value-added industrial sectors. In-work benefits, as was high-\nlighted by several civil servants, were the parliamentary neo-liberal\nright\u2019s \u2018free market\u2019 preference to a national minimum wage (NMW).\nEssentially, in-work benefits and a NMW attempt to offer benefit-depen-\ndent people an incentive to go to work by offering most people a differen-\ntial to out-of-work benefits. However, it was feared that a minimum wage\nwould create increasing wage costs as wage differentials were re-posi-\ntioned:\nA minimum wage would\u2026 trigger spiralling wage demands as higher paid workers strug-\ngled to restore their pay differentials. It would, therefore, price many individuals out of a\njob, regardless of their own wishes or those of their employers. (Department of\nEmployment et al., 1992, p. 39)\nAnd using an example from catering (interestingly one of the most\nnotoriously low-paid sectors in Britain) David Willetts suggested in par-\nliament that:\n\u2018Market Workfare\u2019 87\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nThe minimum wage would have\u2026 effects. One is that the unskilled worker in the kitchen\nwould receive the same pay (as the skilled cook) and the skilled cook would want the differ-\nential reinstated\u2026 The restoration of differentials would lead to an old-fashioned increase\nin wage cost that would drive up unemployment. That is why a minimum wage would\ncost 800,000 jobs at \u00a34 an hour and more than 1 million jobs at \u00a34.26 an hour. (House\nof Commons Debate, 19 February 1997, col. 952)\nIn contrast, in-work benefits were supported, for it was felt they would\nnot interfere with differentials, and as a consequence would not discour-\nage individuals from training and education, thereby reducing Britain\u2019s\ncompetitiveness. Hence, market workfare, and in-work benefits in partic-\nular, were seen as an important mechanism in buttressing Britain\u2019s com-\npetitiveness in the global economy. The important point though, was that\nthe site of competition was not within the undervalued sector of the\nlabour market, but at the level of differentials further up the pay scale. As\nIan McCartney (the Labour Party\u2019s chief spokesperson on employment)\nhighlighted to us, low wages which are concentrated in the service sector\nhave:\nnothing to do with international competitiveness because, in truth, somebody who has\ngot a cleaning contract in a school, say, in Wigan, does not bus in from Sri Lanka to\nManchester airport everyday third world people on 20 cents an hour. They use local\nlabour. This international competitive argument in relation to indigenous service indus-\ntries is an absolute nonsense. (Interview)\nIn contrast, Britain has to compete with European countries to attract\ninward investment and to sell mainly high value-added manufactured\ngoods. Wage levels are seen as an important element of this: \u2018UK hourly\nlabour costs for production workers in manufacturing have been below\nthose in other G7 countries for many years\u2019 (Department of Trade and\nIndustry et al., 1995, p. 104; 1996, p. 55). The fear was that a minimum\nwage would increase these costs, making Britain less competitive through\nthe demand to maintain differentials if a minimum wage was introduced.\nThis was not seen as an issue with in-work benefits because they did not\ndirectly increase the wages of the lowest paid employees. \n\u2018 N E W L A B O U R \u2019 :  \u2018 W E L FA R E - T O - W O R K \u2019  \u2013  A \u2018 N E W D E A L\u2019  F O R T H E\nU N E M P L O Y E D A N D L O N E M O T H E R S\nThe emphasis of the parliamentary neo-liberal right in managing some of\nthe regulatory dilemmas of neo-liberal capital accumulation was upon\nthe market creating employment through deliberately engineering down-\nward pressure on wages, on the one hand, and increasingly stringent\nqualifying criteria on the other hand. What has been the approach of the\nNew Labour administration?\n88 Chris Grover and John Stewart\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nThe initiatives of  New Labour are highlighted by marked continuities,\n\u2018symbolic differences\u2019 and one disjunction: they intend to introduce a\nminimum wage. So, for example, New Labour have not changed any of\nthe market workfare measures outlined above. In fact, some of the mea-\nsures have been extended. On the in-work benefit side, the FC childcare\ndisregard was increased from \u00a360 to \u00a3100 (and the disregarded age was\nincreased to 12 from 11) in the July 1997 Budget, in a hope that it would\n\u2018make child care more affordable\u2019 (Gordon Brown, chancellor of the\nexchequer, House of Commons Debate, 2 July 1997, col. 309). There is\nalso a commitment to FC. The Labour Party document, A New Economic\nFuture for Britain, for example, notes how: \u2018We propose to place the\nresponsibility for the initial identification of potential Family Credit recipi-\nent on the Inland Revenue\u2019 (Labour Party, 1995, p. 40).\nOn the out-of-work benefit side, the direction is increasingly towards\ndisciplining benefit claimants into employment. The New Labour welfare-\nto-work strategy, for example, is presented as offering \u2018a first step onto the\nemployment ladder\u2019 (chancellor of the exchequer, House of Commons\nDebate, 2 July 1997, col. 308) for 18\u201324 year olds. In other words, social\nsecurity payments (now reinterpreted as \u2018welfare\u2019) will act as a \u2018hand up\nnot a hand out\u2019 (Labour Party, 1996, p. 2; Harman, 1997). Claimants,\naged 18\u201324, who have been unemployed for six months or more are to be\ngiven four options: to take a job with an employer who will receive a sub-\nsidy of \u00a360 a week (\u00a375 per week for those aged 25 and over who have\nbeen unemployed for more than two years) per person taken on; work\nwith an environmental task force or a voluntary agency, both of which\nattract a placement fee for the organisation of \u00a33,200 per six months;\nfinally, \u2018there will be a full-time education option\u2019 (David Blunkett, secre-\ntary of state for education and employment, House of Commons Debate,\n3 July 1997, col. 440). \nIn the first option the young person will receive a \u2018market wage\u2019, whilst\nin the environmental task force, and voluntary work options conscripts\nwill receive benefits plus \u00a315 (Finn, 1997, p. 12). In the education option\nthey will receive benefits only. What the welfare-to-work strategy does not\nallow for is a fifth option, \u2018to stay at home on full benefit\u2019 (chancellor of\nthe exchequer, House of Commons Debate, 2 July 1997, col. 308; Blair,\n1997, p. 7). A refusal to take up the offer of a placement under the wel-\nfare-to-work scheme will result in benefit suspension or reductions in\nbenefit (secretary of state for education and employment, House of\nCommons Debate, 3 July 1997, cols. 442\u2013443; Finn, 1997, p. 13). While\nthe disciplinary nature of such legislation is not new (Ginsberg, 1979;\nNovak, 1988; Squires, 1990) and merely builds upon the JSA, there is a\n\u2018Market Workfare\u2019 89\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nfeeling of unease among social policy analysts at the zeal with which\nNew Labour have embraced disciplinary measures (see Lister, 1997).\nIndeed, the benefit penalties of the welfare-to-work strategy are harsher\nthan many in the parliamentary Labour Party had expected (The Times, 4\nJuly 1997). \nThe second important pillar in new Labour\u2019s welfare-to-work strategy\nconcerns lone mothers. Described as an \u2018historic new deal\u2019 (Department\nof Social Security press release 97\/125), the \u2018New Deal for Lone Parents\nwill invite lone parents with school age children into the Job Centre for\nhelp and advice on jobs, training and childcare\u2019 (Department of Social\nSecurity press release 97\/099; 97\/105). Despite its \u2018new\u2019 label the pack-\nage for lone parents is suspiciously similar to the PP scheme (discussed\nabove) which the previous administration was piloting. Although the\nNew Labour government have claimed that there will be no compulsion\nfor lone mothers to attend interviews with advisers (Department of Social\nSecurity press release 97\/105), the pressure on them to leave benefit\nremains the same as nothing has changed with regard to the social and\neconomic stigmatisation of lone mothers. Moreover, it has been observed\nthat Frank Field (then minister for welfare reform) has argued that \u2018every\nsingle mother with children over four (should) be expected to look for\nwork or undertake training\u2019 (cited in Finn, 1997, p. 13).\nThe rationale of New Labour\u2019s welfare-to-work strategy for those offi-\ncially defined as unemployed is similar to that of the previous administra-\ntion: that the wage costs of employers must be reduced to make unem-\nployed people more attractive as potential employees. In giving evidence\nto the Employment Select Committee on the workings of wage subsidies,\nProfessor Dennis Snower of Birkbeck College notes that: \u2018It is clear that\nemployment would rise because labour costs fall and when labour costs\nfall, employment will rise\u2019 (Employment Committee, 1994, question\n186). In this sense, it could be argued that market workfare lives on, for\nthe employment of those currently unemployed will, it is hoped, come\nfrom private employers attracted to the reduced wage costs which come\nwith taking on unemployed people. The responsibility on the state to cre-\nate employment will not be great. Moreover, the emphasis continues to be\non creating employment without igniting inflation. As Professor Richard\nLayard of the London School of Economics explained to the Employment\nSelect Committee: \u2018faced with long term unemployed people who are\nmore attractive to them and this means that it is a greater supply of\nlabour, there is disflationary pressure in the economy\u2019 (Employment\nCommittee, 1994, question 170).\nIn fact, the ideas of the New Labour government have been influenced\n90 Chris Grover and John Stewart\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nby the work of Richard Layard (Finn, 1997, p. 11), who shortly after the\nelection of the new Labour government was \u2018recruited\u2019 as \u2018a key figure in\ndeveloping the Government\u2019s welfare to work policy\u2019 (The Guardian, 26\nJune 1997). Layard is a firm believer in time-limited social security bene-\nfits (Layard and Philpott, 1991, p. 6; Layard and Nickell, 1992, p. 36), as\nwell as having tight conditional clauses controlling access to benefits\n(Jackman et al., 1984a, b) and state-guaranteed employment for the\nunemployed (Layard, 1985, pp. 11\u201313; Employment Committee, 1994,\nquestion 168). Indeed, he and the \u2018underclass right\u2019 believe in the same\ncauses of long-term unemployment. So, for example, in a written submis-\nsion to the Employment Select Committee\u2019s review of workfare, Layard\nargues: \u2018The effect of unemployment benefit availability upon unemploy-\nment is not surprising. Unemployment benefits are a subsidy to idleness,\nand it should not be surprising if they lead to an increase in idleness\u2019\n(Employment Committee, 1994, p. 21).\nHis solution to long-term unemployment is an employment guarantee,\nwith employment being created by incentivising (through subsidies)\nemployers to take on long-term unemployed people. Hence the previously\nlong-term unemployed will be \u2018paid a normal wage\u2026 provided by a nor-\nmal employer\u2019 (Employment Committee, 1994, question 170). We are\nnot suggesting that Layard has an affinity with the neo-liberal right. His\nseemingly concordant comments with the neo-liberal right are linked to\nthat fact that he is an economist. The economic paradigm and its atten-\ndant assumptions within which he works are similar to those of neo-\nclassical economists. Therefore, one would expect his theorising about\nthe causes of employment to be similar to that of people associated with\nother political persuasions. Furthermore, the fact that policies are\nattempting to address the same regulatory dilemmas within the same\neconomic paradigm leads to a congruence of ideas. Hence, subsidies as\nan incentive to employers to employ the long-term unemployed have also\nbeen advocated by the recent Council of Churches report into unemploy-\nment (Council of Churches for Britain and Ireland, 1997, p. 129).\nWhilst continuities with the previous neo-liberal government are\nimportant, there are some important differences too \u2013 though these are\nmore at a symbolic level. The acknowledgement of childcare as \u2018an inte-\ngral part of\u2026 economic policy\u2019 (chancellor of the exchequer, House of\nCommons Debate, 2 July 1997, col. 309) is something which has been\ncampaigned for over many years by organisations such as the Daycare\nTrust. However, with an estimated extra cost of only \u00a310 million for the\nincrease in FC (Department of Social Security press release 97\/099), and\nNational Lottery money to pay for after-school clubs, the financial com-\n\u2018Market Workfare\u2019 91\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nmitment to the \u2018national childcare strategy\u2019 is not overwhelming.\nMoreover, the \u00a3200 million over the lifetime of this parliament allocated\nin the New Deal to help lone mothers into employment must be seen in\nthe context of the abolition of One Parent Benefit, which according to one\nestimate, will save the Exchequer up to \u00a3400 million over the same period\n(Financial Times, 4 July 1997).\nThe second important difference is the commitment to guaranteeing\nwork for all 18\u201324 year olds unemployed for six months or more. This is a\nbreak with the neo-liberal approach which focused upon the market as\nbeing able, given the right economic framework, to create full employ-\nment. The welfare-to-work strategy for the unemployed aims to subsidise\nemployers rather than individuals. In the context of the universality ver-\nsus selectivity debate, this may prove more appealing to those in the\nLabour Party who are against means-testing, because of its alleged effects\non the character of individuals (Field, 1995, p. 10).\nHowever, an important disjuncture with the previous Conservative\nadministration is Labour\u2019s commitment to introduce a NMW. We have\nseen how the Conservative Party rejected a NMW because it was argued\nthat it would be detrimental to Britian\u2019s competitiveness. The new Labour\nadministration face similar dilemmas in the global economic arena, but\nin deciding upon the introduction of a national minimum wage, they will\nbe honouring their pledge to that wing of the labour movement which\nsees a NMW as a solution to poverty in work. This is not to deny that the\nnew Labour administration are not concerned with Britain\u2019s global eco-\nnomic fortunes, but to acknowledge that, within the policy process,\ndilemmas emerge because of the contradictory pressures from different\ninstitutional sites. Moreover, it is possible that the introduction of a NMW\nwill exacerbate those regulatory dilemmas \u2013 particularly high levels of\neconomic inactivity7 \u2013 to be managed in the future. In this sense, it might\nbe argued that the New Deal for the unemployed is merely an administra-\ntive tool to help offset some of the wage costs that will be incurred by\nemployers through the imposition of a NMW. \nC O N C L U S I O N\nThe 1990s have been marked by high levels of economic inactivity, low\nwages and fears of the threat of inflation. This article has argued that\nthese regulatory dilemmas were caused or exacerbated by the neo-liberal\naccumulation strategy adopted in Britain in the late 1980s by the parlia-\nmentary neo-liberal right, and which has, in the main, been accepted by\nthe New Labour government. It was and is thought that the regulatory\ndilemmas could be managed through the social security system. Indeed,\n92 Chris Grover and John Stewart\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nwe have shown that the development of market workfare was the\nresponse of the parliamentary neo-liberal right whilst a variant has been\nadopted by the New Labour government. However, both governments,\nwere or are trying to address the same regulatory dilemmas: economic\ninactivity, inflation and low wage levels. The form of capital accumula-\ntion and its attendant regulatory dilemmas, therefore, explain why there\nis a remarkable similarity between the approaches of the current New\nLabour administration and the previous neo-liberal government.\nRegulatory dilemmas do not change with governments. They change\nwhen the form of capital accumulation changes.\nN O T E S\n1 So, for example, in April 1987 it was claimed by Gordon Brown, then Labour\u2018s regional affairs\nspokesperson, that: \u2018Government ministers are secretly planning a massive US-style assault on\nBritain\u2019s unemployed\u2019 (The Times, 23 April 1987). The accusation was strenuously denied\nwhen Lord Young, the employment secretary, reportedly said that the government had \u2018no\nplans to introduce a workfare-type programme\u2019 (Sunday Times, 26 April 1987).\n2 David Willetts is an important political figure in the study of in-work benefits because he is\ncredited with responsibility for guiding Family Credit through the 1986 Social Security Act\n(personal communication).\n3 The civil servants quoted in this article were all interviewed for a research project. They were\ninterviewed according to the Chatham House Agreement and therefore cannot be identified by\nposition or name. A total of six were interviewed at Department of Social Security and\nDepartment for Education and Employment headquarter offices, but to keep within the spirit of\nthe Chatham House Agreement we have not identified their departments.\n4 Full-time working has been defined since 1992 as 16 hours per week. Note that the average\nnumber of hours worked by part-timers has increased recently due to changing working pat-\nterns by women and is now in excess of that figure at 19.3 hours (Osborne and Nichol, 1996,\np. 479).\n5 This has been one of the more problematic aspects of FC, for in certain circumstances the mar-\nginal tax rate can be up to 97 per cent, leaving the recipient only three pence better-off for each\npound earned.\n6 We have used the term \u2018undervalued labour\u2019, for \u2018skill\u2019 is a socially constructed notion which\nreflects dominant power relations of capital and patriarchy (Peck, 1992). Hence occupations\nwhich often involve a high degree of skill, such as caring in nursing homes, are not recognised\nas being \u2018skilful\u2019 (Wilkinson, 1992).\n7 It has been widely reported, for example, that in the run-up to the 1997 general election John\nPrescott argued that a NMW would increase unemployment (e.g., The Guardian, 14 April\n1997).\nR E F E R E N C E S\nP.
