Inclusive design not only ensures that products, services, interfaces and environments are easier to use for those with special needs or limitations, but in doing so also makes them better for everyone. In Part 1 Design for Inclusivity, written by a team that has pioneered inclusive design practice internationally, reviews recent social trends and pressures that have pushed this subject to the fore, and assesses design responses to date in the international context. The authors make the business case for inclusive design and explain the formalisation of the approach in standards and legislation. Part 2 introduces case studies which describe transport, product, IT, housing and service projects, as well as industry-university collaborative projects, and highlight lessons that have been learned. Part 3 draws together tools, techniques and guidelines, and signposts the reader to key resources as well as offering practical advice on research methods, working with users and industry partners. The book concludes with contributions from leading design consultancies on inclusive design best practice.
