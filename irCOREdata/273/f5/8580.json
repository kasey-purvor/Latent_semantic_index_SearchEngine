The paper reviews the market- \nand resource-based views of the firm and argues that the activities of buyers directly and \nindirectly contribute to the innovation process of a firm as \u2018signallers\u2019, \u2018revealers\u2019 and \n\u2018collaborators\u2019. Examples are drawn from the video games industry which has particular \nconstraints coupled with buyer and innovation demands arising out of fast-changing \ntechnologies, markets and resources that have ever-shortening shelf lives; namely,  \ncharacters, title franchises and gaming\/technology platforms.  We suggest that, for the video \ngame industry, buyers particularly value firms\u2019 dynamic capabilities, specifically those \ncapabilities that contribute to product creation and product development capabilities of \u2018super \ndevelopers\u2019 over other considerations. \n \n\n 1 \nIntroduction \nFirms face turbulent times in these early years of the twenty-first century. Three substantive \nfactors are apparent. First, a globalising economy has brought about not only opportunities \nfor an expanding global market place but also the growing threat of global competition \n(D'Aveni and Gunther, 1994). Second, the pace of technological change and new and \ninnovative business models overtly challenge firms. Finally, market segmentation and \ndiscriminating buyers have disoriented firms (Grant, 1991). Adoption of low cost or product \ndifferentiation strategies is no longer sufficient to keep customers. The only way firms can \nmanage these possible disruptive forces is to incorporate an innovation constituent into their \nstrategic management framework.  \nThere are two constituent parts to an innovation strategy. First, a framework to include \nexternal drivers such as barriers to entry and new developments, governance and bargaining \npower in the value chain and a competitive analysis should be incorporated. We \nconceptualise value chains as more than mere linear relationships, but rather as systems \nthrough which value is added to a product or service en route to final users. Second, firms \nshould concentrate on those resources and capabilities that can create competitive advantage, \nand equip themselves either to respond to or lead change from within.  The criteria employed \nto uncover these resources and capabilities should not be limited only to short term cost \nvariables but ought to include the recognition of future product and technological \ndevelopment potential.   \nThis paper focuses on the unique resources and capabilities that contribute to innovation. \nWhilst some firms are acutely aware of their available resources and exploit them fully, \nothers rely on the catalyst of relations with other firms. Consequently, this paper uses a value \nchain framework to demonstrate the function of one particular catalyst; namely, buyers. The \nargument is made that the activities of buyers directly and indirectly contribute to the \ninnovation process of a firm as \u2018signallers\u2019, \u2018revealers\u2019 and \u2018collaborators\u2019. Examples are \ndrawn from the video games industry (especially the activities of \u2018super developers\u2019) which \nhas particular constraints coupled with buyer and innovation demands arising out of fast-\nchanging technologies, markets and resources. The key buyers in this sector are the \npublishers, most notably US-based Electronic Arts; and publisher-console owners such as \nSony, Microsoft and Nintendo. Both buyer types procure games development expertise from \nin-house studios as well as from independent suppliers such as UK super developers (see \n 2 \nbelow). The buyers are the \u2018governors\u2019 of the value chain in that they have the financial \nresource to develop games and, critically, to market them; these resource needs far exceed \nthose available internally to development companies.   \nDynamic capabilities and strategic upgrading \nIn high velocity markets, it is the resources and capabilities that a firm draws upon to affect \nchange \u2013 its dynamic capabilities \u2013 that are particularly effective in fostering a competitive \nposition. Dynamic capabilities effect change through the creation of new resource \nconfigurations (Teece and Pisano, 1994; Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000) and enable the \nacquisition and application of  new knowledge resources  (Kogut and Zander, 1992). In their \nseminal paper, Teece and Pisano (Teece and Pisano, 1994) and elaborated in (Teece, Pisano \net al., 1997), characterise dynamic capabilities as being shaped and limited by the firms\u2019 \ntechnological trajectories (Dosi, 1982), market position and organisational routines (Nelson \nand Winter, 1982). Although the very distinctiveness of dynamic capabilities is what provides \nfirms with competitive advantage, they can also exhibit qualities that are familiar across \nfirms. These recognisable routines are often described as good practices. This formulation of \ngood practices, however, should not be seen as \u2018one-size fits all\u2019. Common good practices \ncan be found among firms which is useful to identify clusters or work themes. Such themes \ndo not, however, include embedded and often hidden routines and behaviours that are \nrequired for successful implementation. The implementation of a good practice requires firm-\nspecific contingencies. It is these adaptations that allow firms to find a unique fit and achieve \ncompetitive advantage. \nFirms call upon dynamic capabilities and other resources such as capital investment and \nmanagerial co-ordination to upgrade firm-specific processes and products, functions (and \nlinks between functions) and inter-firm co-ordination and communication web (e.g. supply \nchain management, marketing relations, etc). Firms can also apply these capabilities to move \ninto new markets and value positions. Finally, firms can decide not to upgrade but, instead, \nenter into a market transaction by either purchasing the resource and capability if the firm \ncurrently does not perform the process or function or outsource existing in-house activities if \nthe decision is not to upgrade. Of course, firms rarely want the resources and capabilities per \nse; rather, firms value the results from the application of the resources and capabilities \n(D'Aveni and Gunther, 1994; Greco, 1997; Quinn, 1999).  \n 3 \nFirms draw upon two sources for dynamic capabilities: those that are internally managed and \ncontrolled, and those that are drawn from external sources. The value chain framework \ncomplements this external search as we extend the boundary of the firm. Examples of \ndynamic capabilities and their location include:  \n\u2022 internal capabilities that are explicit and homogeneous (i.e. resemble good practices) \nsuch as product development and strategic decision making (Eisenhardt and Martin, \n2000);  \n\u2022 internal capabilities that are tacit and heterogeneous (i.e. contingent) such as \nknowledge resources (Grant, 1996; Kogut, 1996);  \n\u2022 inter-relationship capabilities including commercial alliances (Lorenzoni and \nLipparini, 1999; Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000); \n\u2022 inter-firm cooperation (Schmitz and Knorringa, 2000; Bessant, Kaplinsky et al., \n2003).  \nTable 1 captures some of the sources available to firms for dynamic capabilities.  \nTable 1: Location of dynamic capabilities \nSource Comment \nExisting internal dynamic \ncapabilities  \nIncluding parent and subsidiary organisations  and mergers \nand acquisitions  \nDirect buyers and customers Using existing market-based relations \nSuppliers Using existing supply chain relations \nThird party  For example, a consultancy firm \nSharing externalities A cluster viewpoint \nNot-for-profit partners Government, universities, Research & Technology Orgs \n  \nThe next section explores how firms can use one source \u2013 buyer relationships \u2013 in the \nidentification of an upgrading strategy.  \nThe role of buyers in the innovation process \nBuyers can perform three roles in directing an upgrading trajectory. First, in a buyer-driven \nvalue chain (where buyers have significant bargaining power) they signal current and future \n 4 \nvalue criteria that will influence the direction of an upgrading strategy. Second, buyers can \nreveal the strategic resources and capabilities which contribute to the creation of value \ncriteria. And finally, buyers can be collaborators in an upgrading strategy. The three \npossibilities are outlined below. \nTable 2: Summary of buyer roles in innovation management \nRole of Buyer Potential upgrading trajectory \nSignaller Changes in the value criteria inform firms of the outcome of  upgrading \nRevealer Identifying strategic resources and capabilities for new buyers or market \nofferings. In high velocity markets, buyers can reveal dynamic \ncapabilities  \nCollaborator Inform and contribute to upgrading, e.g. lead-users \n \nThe first two roles are implicit in that the information generated only informs firms of the \npossible upgrading type. The collaborator role is explicit and involved, i.e. the buyer and the \nfirm are aware of and committed to a specific action (but not necessarily a result).  \n \nBuyers as signallers of value criteria \n \nAn important source of value criteria can be an assessment of the preferences of customers. \nCriteria may include preference metrics such as scale ranking (Kaplinsky and Morris, 2001), \nan allocation of value points (Hill, 2000), and an algorithm of satisfaction and importance \nscale rankings (Ulwick, 2002). These measures impart customer specification and other \nrelevant data that can be transformed into viable corporate and manufacturing strategies. For \nexample, a buyer may identify price, quality and delivery as the three most important value \ncriteria for a particular firm\u2019s product. The buyer equally can signal preferences for one year \nin the future; for example, customisation and brand-name awareness. These latter examples \nrepresent an upgrading opportunity. \nHowever, there are three dangers of an over-reliance on customer-derived upgrading data. \nCaution is therefore needed when firms interpret data. First, customers are unlikely to agree \non the relative importance of value criteria and this can lead to mixed signals. Second, value \ncriteria are product and process biased; customers rarely mention functional or value chain \nfactors in customer preference surveys. Finally, value criteria rarely provide signals related to \nparticular resources and capabilities. Only the expected outcome is identified. Firms require \nmore information in order to reveal their internal resource assets. \n 5 \nBuyers as revealers of strategic resources and capabilities \nAnother contentious issue about over-reliance of customer signals is accessibility. Firms have \nto consider another approach to attract buyers. There are situations when firms will want to \noffer buyers something new that does not necessarily reveal itself directly in a customer-\nfocus (signalling) strategy. Firms can formulate a strategy partly from their internal fold (i.e. \nwhat they do best) (Wernerfelt, 1984; Barney, 1991; Grant, 1991) but first, these strategic \nresources and capabilities have to be unearthed. Firms may control and own the resource base \nbut it is the customers that ultimately determine whether the outcome of the application of \nthese resources provide value.  \nFigure 1 below provides a three stage process for identifying strategic resources using \ninformation provided by buyers. First, customers identify their priorities based on a set of \nvalue criteria. Second, firms identify the resources and capabilities that support the formation \nof these criteria. Finally, firms prioritise those resources and capabilities that are strategic. \nFigure 1: Indirect identification of resources and capabilities by buyers \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBuyers are asked to identify the value criteria that they deem important for the selection of a \nproduct and to reveal the level of satisfaction of the provision of these criteria. The criteria \nthat are ranked important and with which the customer is highly satisfied, reveal areas in the \nfirm that the customer perceives value and in which the firm excels. This suggests that the \ncorresponding resources could be applied to other buyers in the same market. For those that \nare deemed not important the corresponding resources could be valuable if they were applied \nto the formation of another market offering or outsourced. This is a time consuming exercise \nand firms require expertise to interpret these customer revelations. \n \nIdentify Most \nImportant and Most \nSatisfied Value \nCriteria which \ncustomers value in a \nproduct\/ service \noffering \n \nValue strategy \nwhich consists of a \nset of value criteria  \nFirm Buyer \nProduct\/ \nService \nOffering \nStrategic \nresources and \ncapabilities \nused for each \nvalue criterion \nSupporting \nresources and \ncapabilities \nused for each \nvalue criterion  \n 6 \nThis assessment, however, omits two important steps in the formulation of a new offering. \nFirst, even after the identification of internal strategic resources and capabilities, what does a \nfirm do next? Customers do not directly value a resource base; rather, they value the outcome \nof the application of resources. A firm needs to consider a strategy identification process \n(which evolves from the resource base). Second, the ability of firms to transfer this resource \nbase needs to be recognised. Firms make use of valuable and sustainable resources and \ncapabilities to achieve a current competitive advantage but will require dynamic capabilities \nto reinvent or create new resources and capabilities (Monteealegre, 2002). Buyers can reveal \nthe strategic capabilities which they value \u2013 including the good practice or explicit elements \nof dynamic capabilities (particularly in fast changing markets) \u2013 but the outcome of the \napplication of these capabilities in any future undertaking is uncertain. In the role of revealer, \nbuyers do not influence the application of resources.  For this to happen, buyers have to \nbecome collaborators in the innovation process. \nBuyers as collaborators for upgrading  \nCollaboration inevitably has both market and resource-based elements. Commercial \ntransactions that are measurable are only one of many types of relationship involving buyers \nand suppliers. Relationships are usually considered part of the make-or-buy decision making \nprocess (vertical in-house or horizontal transaction-based). However, this analytical \nframework does not capture fully the dynamic of knowledge distributed across a network of \norganisations (Zajac and Olsen, 1993; Lorenzoni and Lipparini, 1999). Moreover, research \ninto inter-firm upgrading has primarily focused on buyers that initiate and control the \ncollaboration of suppliers and where buyers have upgraded suppliers\u2019 products and processes \n(Kaplinsky, Morris et al., 2002). Examples of buyer-firm collaborations include product \ndevelopment such as lead-user activities (von Hippel, 1986) and process improvements \n(Womack, Jones et al., 1990; Bessant, Kaplinsky et al., 2003). \nBefore buyer\/firm collaborations can take root, firms require the capability to work with \nbuyers beyond single event transactions. This requires the ability to share resources and \ncapabilities in activities where the result is not immediate (or apparent). For example, \nknowledge assets are critical inputs to the design of customer interactions (Day, 1994). Hence \ntrust and reputation are significant (Sheth and Parvatiyar, 1995). It is clear that firms wanting \nto access a resource controlled by buyers should both fulfil their current obligations and \n 7 \npresent buyers with a future market opportunity (Srivastava, Fahey et al., 2001). Buyers \nunderstand the value of collaborating by the attractiveness of the proposition.  \n The buyer\/firm framework described above provides analytical insights into the scope and \nnature of inter-firm relations. First, the quality requirements of a transaction are represented \nby the buyer\u2019s signals; second, the strategic resources of the firm are revealed by means of a \ncommunication feedback mechanism for evaluating past and present performance, and \nfinally, the buyers\/firm collaboration indicates the degree of interdependency of product \ninnovation. Firms can also use this framework to inform them of their strategic upgrading \nchoices. The information generated by buyer signals, revelations and collaborations has \nimplication for the immediate and future strategies firms develop within their value chain.  \nThe next section discusses the application of this framework to explain the upgrading \nstrategies of \u2018super developers\u2019 in the video game industry (VGI) in the UK.  We start with a \nvery brief description of the research themes generated by the sector followed by an overview \nof the developments in the global video game industry in order to place our research in a \nsuitable historical and technological context.  \nThe video game industry \nResearch themes \nThe literature on the global VGI is growing; the focus tends to be on consoles (Asakura and \nKutaragi, 2000; Shankar and Baybus, 2002; Schilling, 2003), development processes \n(Aoyama and Izushi, 2003; Tschang, 2003) and other cultural issues such as gender (Cassell \nand Jenkins, 1998; Bryce and Rutter, 2003), the cultural form (Cassell and Jenkins, 1998; \nKirks\u00e6ther, 1998; Juul, 2001; King and Krzywinska, 2002; Bryce and Rutter, 2003) and \nvarieties on the theme of violence and the military (Griffiths, 1999; Lenoir, 2002). \nThe global video game industry \u2013 A brief history \nThe story of the video game industry is one of changing technology and institutional \nlandscape. The VGI is a relatively young industry characterised by four related features:  \n\u2022 new technological developments;  \n\u2022 entry, rise and exit of entrants;  \n\u2022 introduction and specialisation of activities in the value chain; and,  \n\u2022 the ebb and flow of  power relations between three critical players in the industry:  \n 8 \no technology console\/platform owners;  \no design talent and \u2018super developers\u2019; and  \no publishers.  \nThe early commercial history of video games inevitably commences with the US military\u2019s \ncomputer hardware and networks facilitating both game development and consumption, \nalbeit amongst a privileged few. Steve Russell\u2019s rudimentary Spacewar (1962) came out of \nMIT Labs; whilst the Odyssey (eventually manufactured and distributed by Magnavox) was a \nproduct of Ralph Baer at Sanders Associates, a US defence contractor. (The US military \nremains an active participant in the video games industry. America\u2019s Army \u2013 \nhttp:\/\/americasarmy.com \u2013 has 4 million registered online users.)  \nIt is generally accepted that Nolan Bushnell, the founder of Atari is the architect of the global \ncommercial video game industry. Bushnell was responsible for generations of home and \narcade gaming hardware and software including the truly seminal game, Pong (see Table 4 \nbelow). Arcades peaked in the US in 1981 (Japanese arcade technology, however, survived \nwell into the 1990s), but many titles were converted to play on the emerging home \ntechnology \u2013 home computers and consoles. This period also witnesses the emergence of \nindependent developers and publishers \u2013 Activision, for example, was founded by former \nAtari developers seeking greater ownership and control over their developments (Kent, \n2001). \nThe arrival of Nintendo in the 8-bit technology era presaged the ownership of platforms by \nmanufacturers. Nintendo inserted patented and copyrighted disabling code into their Nintendo \nEntertainment System (NES) to restrict external development activity. Exclusive licences \nwere granted to developers that included clauses limiting their ability to work on competing \nsystems. There were also restrictions to the number of games they could develop annually for \nNintendo. Nintendo also contractually obligated its developers to pre-purchase cartridges; \neffectively increasing their development risk (Schilling, 2003).  Sega introduced its 16-bit \nGenesis system in 1989 forcing Nintendo belatedly, in 1991, to upgrade to the Super NES. A \nduopoly ensued over the next five years in which neither system prevailed. The period of the \nlate 1980s to mid 1990s saw familiar publishing names in the modern industry adhering to \npunitive licensing conditions because the two console companies dominated the global \nmarket place.  \n 9 \n It was during this period that Electronic Arts (EA), the most influential publisher in the \nmodern era with global revenues of just under US$3bn in 2004, started to make inroads into \nthe market.  EA became a significant games developer when Acclaim (at the time the most \nsignificant US games developer) negotiated a parallel development contract with Sega to \ndevelop Genesis titles in 1990 while also remaining a supplier to Nintendo. This development \nundermined the sole contracting systems which prevailed at the time and provided EA with \nthe flexibility to form market relationships with other existing game console manufacturers \nand the new entrants that emerged. For example, EA signed a \u2018sweetheart\u2019 deal with Sony on \nthe launch of the PlayStation ensuring a supply of high quality titles (Schilling, 2003). \nEmbracing different technologies and servicing several market relationships simultaneously \nformed the backbone of EA\u2019s strategy in this fast-changing environment.  \nThe Sony PlayStation was launched to North American gamers in 1995. Its architecture made \ngames development relatively easy, and favourable licence conditions generated considerable \ncommitment on the part of developers. Its 128-bit successor, PlayStation 2, had a powerful \ngraphics processor which had a discernible impact on gameplay. Sony demonstrated that the \nmarket could accommodate new console entrants; Sony also shifted the console from the \nbedroom to the living room further expanding access and with it the software market. These \nfactors brought Microsoft into the market with the launch the Xbox in 2001 (Kent, 2001). In \n2003, Sony enjoyed a market share of 66 per cent with Nintendo and Microsoft sharing the \nrest. \n 10 \nTable 3: A brief guide to the development of the video game industry1 \nEra Period Systems\/companies \n \nNotable games of era \nMilitary; (Uni) Utah, \nStanford & MIT \n1961-71 Magnavox Odyssey \nAtari \nSpacewar  \nPong \nFirst generation: \nhome cartridge \n1972-77 RCA Studio II  \nFairchild Channel F \nColeco Telstar \nBaseball; Tic Tac Toe  \nSecond generation: \nboom \n1977-81 Atari VCS\/2600 \nBally Professional Arcade \nMagnavox Odyssey 2 \nColeco Telstar Arcade \nMattell Intellivision \nSpace Invaders; Asteroids; ET; \nAstro Battle; Basketball; Shark! \nShark! \nThird generation: the \ndark ages \n1982-84 Atari 5200 & 800 \nColeco Vision \nCommodore 64 \nApple II \nVectrex \nPole Position; Dig Dug; Congo \nBongo; Kung-Fu Master; Space \nFury; Polar Rescue; Cabbage Patch \nKids Picture Show; Where In The \nWorld Is Carmen Sandiego? \nFourth Generation: 8-\nbit \n1985-89 Sega Master \nNintendo Ent.

This suggests that the \nindustry has yet to enter a mature phase. The early entrants are no longer active in the market \nwhile the current market leaders are large technology-based multi-nationals endowed with \nresources to develop next-generation technologies. Moreover, game console technologies and \nvideo games software, while increasingly inter-dependent in terms of marketing and \nconsumer perception, are controlled and managed by separate firms.  The early history of the \nall-inclusive game console gave way to separate technology console firms and software game \n                                                 \n1 Sources: http:\/\/www.roachnest.com\/vectrex.html; http:\/\/www.retro-games.co.uk\/; \nhttp:\/\/myweb.tiscali.co.uk\/mickfrench\/coleco.htm; http:\/\/www.consolepassion.co.uk\/; \nhttp:\/\/www.geekcomix.com\/vgh\/; http:\/\/www.classicgaming.com\/ \n \n 11 \ndevelopers. Publishers gained prominence as brokers and this function facilitated cross-\nplatform game titles. The current industry phase, arguably, is one of intellectual property \ndevelopment and management. This process is best exemplified by Sega exiting the console \nmarket in 2001 to concentrate on publishing (Dietl and Royer, 2003). Console (platform) \nowners, game developers and publishers perceive value shifting towards the management and \nownership of the copyrighted franchises licensed to \u2013 but not owned by \u2013 leisure software \ndevelopers. \nMethod \nThe data for this section were collected as part of a project for the South East England \nDevelopment Agency, SEEDA (the published report can be retrieved from \nhttp:\/\/www.wiredsussex.com\/busadvice\/whitepapers.asp). The data were collected between \nFebruary and May 2003 and involved in-depth interviews with key personnel in nine \nindependent games development businesses in two clusters in the UK. Additional data had \nbeen collected the previous year in another six firms located in a third UK cluster. Interviews \nwere recorded and transcribed by the authors. The typology of games development \nbusinesses and the value chain frameworks illustrated below are derived from the collected \ndata.  \nThis paper focuses on what we call \u2018super developers\u2019. The traditional developer model is \none of a small group of creatives \u2013 coders, designers and artists \u2013 who take character \nintellectual property (IP) and produce a game for a specific platform (for example, PC). They \ntend to be single teams working on discrete projects with little expertise in terms of business \ndiscipline and financial management. In the modern industry this traditional model is \nincreasingly rare due to factors like globalisation (of markets), complexity (leading to larger \nteam sizes and hence increased development costs) and the high cost of character IP.  The \ntruly aspirational developers of the past two decades foresaw the need to create companies \nthat could utilise their array of resources. As one self-styled UK-based super developer notes \n\u201cThe business model of the super developer is one of consolidating the management, design, \ntechnology, and supporting resources within a central core to which the development teams \nacts as satellites\u201d (personal communication with authors). Super developers are characterised \nby their \u2018platform agnosticism\u2019; that is, their capabilities across platform types (including \nconsoles, PCs and increasingly online and wireless) and their aspirations to own character \nand franchise IP in the short to medium term. However, super developers may also be \nspecialist\/niche and\/or original IP developers (some have semi-autonomous subsidiaries with \n 12 \nsuch remits replicating the traditional developer model with the added security of a super \ndeveloper parent), service providers (for example, testing other developers\u2019 products, \nproviding \u2018middleware\u2019 modules), and work-for-hire which involves competition for \ndevelopment contracts from publishers for a fixed sum. The development community is, \ntherefore, diverse in business size, competences and business models.  \nFigure 2: Typology of games businesses \nOriginal IP \ndevelopers \n\u2018Super developers\u2019: \nplatform\/delivery\/IP \nagnostic \nService \nproviders \nWork-for-hire \n\u2022 publishers\u2019 \nown IP \n\u2022 Localisation \n\u2022 Porting, etc. \nOther, inc. \nmobile \n \n \nThe VGI value chain \nThe video games value chain of the early 1990s is represented in Figure 3. It reflects a world \nin which a specialised development sector emerged, and the onset of a division in publishing \nbetween cross-platform global publishers (such as EA) and console platform owners (Sony, \nNintendo and Microsoft\/Xbox).  \nFigure 3: Video games value chain early 1990s \u2013 the rise of consoles  \n \nCustomersDevelopers\nGames for enthusiasts; increasingly complex; increasing money value\nConsoles: globalisation; expensive (requiring) new tools, new \nskills, entry barriers\nPublishers\nInc. Console\nIndependent \nretailers\nDistributors\n 13 \nOver the decade of the 1990s, the major developments were the growing influence of console \nbusinesses (and a new dependence by games developers on console owners), the extended \ndevelopment of independent publishers, the growing division of labour in games \ndevelopment, and the emerging power of retailers (Figure 4).  \nFigure 4: The contemporary VGI value chain \n \n \nThe dependency relationships that emerged in this period define the global industry. The \npublishers are the key actors \u2013 governors \u2013 through their control over the key industry \nresource: characters and franchise licences (IP). These range from Hollywood franchises such \nas The Matrix (where the crossover between media was particularly evident and germane); \nbooks (e.g. Harry Potter); sport franchises based around players (e.g. EA\u2019s Tiger Woods \nPGA Tour 2004), managers (e.g. EA\u2019s Total Club Manager 2005), and format owners (e.g. \nFifa football\/Formula One 2003). The publishers, therefore, are the buyers who provide the \nmajority of funding for games development which enables them to set the parameters to \nwhich all other stakeholders have to perform (next-generation console games will cost in the \nregion of \u20ac9m each). They also act as the major gateway to consumers. Most independent \ndevelopers have to make pitches to publishers to win the rights to develop this IP. They do \nthis by presenting working models which demonstrate not only what the developers might do \nwith the characters in terms of story and \u2018gameplay\u2019, but also demonstrate various \ntechnological and managerial capabilities. The console platform owners act as gatekeepers to \ntheir own technology in granting development licences and limiting access to development \nCustomers\nDevelopers\nConsoles: powerful; high quality; relative low price \nPublishers Chain \nretailers\nDistributors\nPackaging\nPeripherals\n\u2018Governors\u2019\nCompetition Opportunity\nIndia, Eastern Europe\nOther UK Clusters\nGraphics\nMiddleware Audio\nFinance\nOther \nservices\nHigh money value; mass market; \u2018hit\u2019\ndependent \nOther media: \nfilms\/books\n 14 \nkits. Where all console platform owners are publishers, not all publishers are platform \nowners.  \n Retailers are also increasing their influence in the value chain. Despite the digital nature of \nthe product, the predominant distribution medium is the boxed CD ROM sold increasingly in \nnon-specialist chain stores such as electrical and food retailers. Consequently, they can \ndetermine the visibility of the product for the mass market. It is, therefore, very important that \npublishers have a direct link to buyers to ensure the profile of a title once it is released. \nIt is also clear that UK and European developers are subject to pressures from other \nregionally-clustered businesses both domestically and with newly emerging \u2018coding\u2019 \ncountries such as Hungary and India. Developers, therefore, occupy space where the barriers \nto entry are relatively low (comparable to what manufacturing companies have experienced \nin relation to outsourcing to China).  \nGames developers in the UK and elsewhere in Europe are themselves in transition in order to \nattract work from global publishers (the publishing powerhouses are located in North \nAmerica, France and Japan). The ability successfully to secure projects is increasingly \ndependent on the creation of a development brand-name (individual firms or groups of firms). \nBrands signify a range of attributes and capabilities that include maturity and durability (i.e. \nthe developer has financial resources and a critical mass of transferable talent to support and \ncomplete the project); robust business processes; competent management; and platform \nagnosticism (can develop for the majority of platforms). It also indicates a track record of \nsuccessful titles in their portfolio and being selective in their choice of publishers for whom \nthey are willing to develop IP (i.e. not all publishers are equal and working with or for the \nright partner in the past is a positive selling attribute for future work).  \nTransactions between publishers and developers are project based. Whilst this behaviour \nsuggests market adherence in the alignment of resources to suit buyer needs, super developers \nshow themselves not to be quite so transparent and dependent. This disinclination to be \ndominated by any one buyer is partly due to the way publishers govern developers. Despite \ndevelopers originating considerable character and franchise IP, publishers govern these \nsuppliers on a project-to-project basis and put limited obligation on past relationships. As one \ndeveloper expressed it, \u201c[t]he character can just walk away from us.\u201d (Interview with authors, \n18 February 2003). \nBuyers as revealers \n 15 \nThis situation also puts buyers in the role of revealers: buyers continuously focus on the \ncurrent and potential \u2013 and not previous \u2013 capabilities of developers to create new characters \nfor the marketplace. To illustrate this point, the nine super developers in our sample have, \nover time, come to appreciate the long-term value of (and need to acquire) own character and \nfranchise IP. One firm audaciously achieved this through the purchase of a traditional paper-\nbased comic book claiming development rights to some 700 characters in the process.  \nThe shift away from a small niche market to mass market products promoted by publishers, \nretailers and platform owners has generated high value characters in tandem with high \nexpectations from end-users (gamers). Competition among the different titles (including titles \nmanaged by the same publisher) feeds this demand for new products. This has led to ever-\nshortening product life-cycles, product \u2018hit dependency\u2019 and pressure to reduce lead times. \nMoreover, development costs are rising for each generation of games \u2013 mass market titles \ngenerally ran on budgets in excess of \u20ac3m in 2003. For global publishers, the significant \nfactor is not the cost of development, but rather the ability to launch a title on time. This is \nimportant because many titles are film\/sporting event tie-ins, or earmarked for seasonal \nmarkets. It is the loss accruing to failing to meet launch dates rather than the cost of \ndevelopment per se that developers need to manage.  \nHowever, these costs are significant for developers and it has the effect of locking developers \ninto strict contractual funding relationships with publishers in order to access resources. This \nhas the effect of limiting the scope of companies to perform most developmental activities in-\nhouse (as was traditionally the case). This steers companies to consider options to outsource \nand buy-in game engines (the base code on which all other game features sit) and other \nessential technologies such as tools, audio and motion capture (see Figure 5 below). Business \nfunctions such as legal services, by contrast, have traditionally been outsourced. \n 16 \nFigure 5: Outsourced Services and Functions \n8\n77 77 77\n85\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\nGame design Audio\/fmv\/ mocap Graphics Localisation Legal\nService\nPe\nrc\nen\nt\n \nOne possible out-sourcing strategy is to include more value-added developmental work in \nmiddleware (automation modules). The extension of middleware could lead the development \nprocess towards modularity which would reduce costs (i.e. sharing engines and tools), \nprovide some flexibility (modular customisation) and reduce lead times (accessing and \nintegrating ready-made modules to speed-up the process).  \nIn our study we explored developers\u2019 attitudes towards middleware modules. Some industry \nstakeholders are upbeat about middleware utility. As one global games company noted:  \n[I]f you look at a title like [GTA] Vice City, it took [\u00a3]12 million in its first week in \nthe UK, it did [\u00a3]70 million in its first week in the US, they built it in 9 months. \nThey\u2026 built it using [middleware]\u2026You buy a physics engine, you buy a graphics \nengine, you buy a sound engine, it\u2019s content. Content is king. (Interview with authors, \n26 February 2003) \nWorking with middleware modules, therefore, can significantly improve process efficiency, \nreduce costs and lead times and enables developers to concentrate on content rather than \ntechnology.  \nThis observation is important because there are times when market conditions suggest that \nthe modularisation approach to title development is absolutely right for all stakeholders. The \n 17 \nGTA concept2 was well developed and the market could carry a variation on the theme that \nwas not radically innovative relative to previous releases.  \nThat said, for publishers and developers to embrace this modularisation approach for all titles \nmay be unwise. The success of Vice City was not derived absolutely from its perceived \noriginality or \u2018gameplay\u2019, two prerequisites for successful titles (though it certainly had \nattractive design features for players). A significant factor in its success was arguably its \nseductive violent narrative content coupled with the publisher\u2019s ability to exploit the \nfranchise brand. Moreover, the modularisation approach suits in-house development by \npublishers who have varying levels of development capacity. Consequently, both buyers \n(publishers) and developers share a belief in the value of employing a mixed approach which \nbalances the exploitation of market opportunities with maintenance of innovation and \ncreativity capabilities for the longer-term (both in-house and across the independent sector).  \nSuper developer attitudes to middleware \nThe historical craft legacy of leisure software development lingers which may be one reason \nwhy market pressures have not prevailed. Still, some developers take a pragmatic view of the \ninevitable ascendance of middleware engines and tools. As one developer explained:  \n[t]he main reason [for not using middleware] is that there isn\u2019t really anything which \nwould replace anything we\u2019ve got without leaving chunks of work that would need to \nbe done to get back to where we are with [our in-house technology]. Some games \ncompanies have a gut reaction [against] using other people\u2019s technology just because \npeople like doing it themselves. It\u2019s more of a legacy cultural thing. For us it\u2019s purely \na matter of how much it\u2019s going to cost to get it working and get the game finished. \nSo far it\u2019s never been cost effective to use middleware. (Interview with author, 14 \nFebruary 2003). \nArguably, as the complexity of the next generation console technology increases, middleware \nmodules will offer \u2018solutions\u2019 for games developers. However, the limitation of middleware \nis its ubiquity and the diffused knowledge in and around it: \nAnd I don\u2019t think that adds value. Every one of those individuals has to take a profit \nmargin. Middleware can\u2019t work on a \u2018well, we\u2019ll just do that because we need it for a \ngame\u2019, they\u2019ve got to take a margin. And most businesses that I think of are probably \n                                                 \n2 GTA stands for Grand Theft Auto (see http:\/\/www.rockstargames.com\/grandtheftauto\/). The game is narrative \ndriven and involves third-party ingratiation with the criminal fraternity through \u2013 largely \u2013 illegal acts including \nstealing cars, drug trafficking and murder.  \n 18 \ngoing to make a 50 per cent margin on the costs, because they\u2019ve got all the other \ncosts of marketing and promoting it. So, they have to take money, if your whole \nproject is composed of middleware where are your costs? Where\u2019s your margin? \nEverybody knows how much it costs you to buy this engine, to buy this sound drive, \nto buy all these things, buy in these resources. Do you do a mark-up? How does the \nbusiness model work?  (Interview with author, 17 March 2003) \nEqually, buying-in resources like game engines leaves developers exposed. If they seek to \navoid being mere aggregators of component technologies, their key resource is their library of \ncore technologies \u2013 and the minds behind them. One firm in the sample encountered this \ndilemma in the development of a Triple A title for a global publisher. They pitched on the \nbasis of their proprietary technology only to find that it was inferior and not fit for the task: \n\u201cwe did get beaten up by [the publisher]\u201d. Whilst the pressure of the project deadline pointed \ntowards buying-in a game engine to complete the title, to have done so would have been \nshort-sighted. On reflection, the developer conceded:  \nI\u2019m glad that we do have our own technology. One of the reasons for that is because \nin placing products with publishers and with five teams we have a lot of mouths to \nfeed. So we have to be on top of things when we are signing new projects\u2026we were \nforced to bring our technology up to speed.  (Interview with author, 21 May 2005)  \nIn other words, this developer elected to spend considerable resources developing a new \nengine for the particular title and to retain this engine as a core proprietary technology to be \nenhanced and used for subsequent projects in the title portfolio across five teams. Indeed, \nthey established a core technology team to manage this. It also set them apart from other \ndevelopers in subsequent pitches and enabled them to leverage this technology in negotiating \nfavourable terms on new projects.  \nThe management team saw the dangers in restricting the agenda to delivering on the project \nat the expense of developing the intellectual and technological competences of the business \nas a whole and being subject to lock-in. Another developer expressed it thus: \n[Proprietary technology] It\u2019s family silver. If you say, \u2018we\u2019ve got something that all \nthese other guys haven\u2019t, they\u2019re all buying off-the-shelf stuff. They\u2019re all same, \nsame, same; me too, me too, me too\u2026\u2019 Once you are sold into [middleware] you are \nstuck. You\u2019ve got [middleware], and all the other guys have got [middleware], and \n 19 \nwhat\u2019s your advantage when you go to publishers? (Interview with author, 14 March \n2003) \nFinally, there is the issue of process efficiency. This was expressed particularly eloquently by \ntwo developers. First: \nDoes it give us competitive advantage? Yes, because we can optimise everything. \nTowards the end of the project we can take [stock] of all of our libraries and turn the \nwhole lot into an assembly. (Interview with author, 18 February 2003) \nSecond: \nAll that a middleware engine does is shift complexity. So you start off looking like \nyou are solving the problems but then all the problems pile up at the end of the \nproject. Whereas if you don\u2019t start with a middleware engine, you end up with a tonne \nof problems at the beginning, which is where you have got the most time and \nflexibility, and then you solve the problems at the end of the project and you just have \nto get on and deliver the project. Most projects done with middleware engines have \nhuge problems at the end if you track them compared to having problems at the \nbeginning if you haven\u2019t got the technology in place. (Interview with author, 17 \nMarch 2003). \nThe ultimate risk in following middleware or modularisation strategy, consequently, is that \ndevelopers may become mere aggregators of others\u2019 technology which would in the long \nterm lose the interest of buyers. Buyers have not only signalled their preference for \ninnovative products but, by continuously supporting developmental projects, buyers have \nrevealed to developers that new products are their strategic strengths. And underpinning new \nproduct development are access and control of character IP and technological competences. \nBuyers, moreover, have also revealed the weakness inherent in middleware through their \nexpressed value criteria including technology innovation, gameplay and originality \n(TerKeurst, 2003). Although pressures to reduce developmental costs remain a business \npriority, publishers, for the time being, are willing to accept high developmental costs so long \nas the \u2018innovation\u2019 criterion is met.   \nThese data from super developers whose core development is in the UK, illustrate not only \nthe importance of strategy being informed by both market- and resource-based views, but \nalso the maturity of this particular \u2018new engineering\u2019 knowledge-intensive sector in its \nresponse to globalisation and pressures from within the value chain. The approaches to \n 20 \nmiddleware procurement and utilisation act as a proxy for strategy informed by resource \nexploitation where pure market-based strategies would give short-term advantage only. \nIndeed, one of our cases demonstrates in particular how close some management teams get to \nsuccumbing to pressure from buyers to deliver products at the expense of the health of the \nbusiness as a whole. Super developers are clear about what mix of resources make them such, \nand how the mix contributes to their sustained global presence. They resist exhortations to \nbuy-in core technologies on the grounds that they inhibit both creative and process innovation \nand, by definition, modules are neither rare nor non-substitutable. Moreover, innovation in \ntechnology and creativity is the hallmark of the British leisure software industry \u2013 \u2018Britsoft\u2019 \u2013 \nwhich is perceived to be undermined by middleware solutions. Whether this resistance to \nmodularisation continues, in light of growing complexity, only time will tell. But super \ndevelopers, on this evidence, define themselves as technology businesses and not as module \naggregators. \nOne further signal is that developing for next-generation consoles, middleware will feature \nheavily. Electronic Arts (EA), for example, has signalled this by actually purchasing \nCriterion Software, owners of \u2018Renderware\u2019. But to suggest that middleware use will always \nbe a requirement is another matter. For example, other publishers are unlikely to endorse \nRenderware under EA\u2019s ownership. Super developers\u2019 seeking to do business with other \npublishers will need also their own technology or a facility with other middleware products to \ndevelop for them. \nBuyers indicate innovation as the critical value criterion and knowledge resources are the \ncritical assets for the creation of new leisure software products. This does not mean that \npressure on the cost base is dissipated; rather, the innovative nature of the product is \nrecognised and the buyer is willing to pay higher rents for this value. Process efficiency is \nincreasingly a given (and is embedded in brand) in relations between buyers and developers. \nThe pace of change in this industry is such that the demand for new products with innovative \nfeatures is greater than the demand for lowering costs. Whilst middleware can provide \nsavings to the cost structure, it cannot, at this time, deliver on the innovative features \ndemanded of new products. This is not the case in other industries where longer product life \ncycles dominate and where buyers value improving process efficiency. \n 21 \nTable 4: Summary of middleware utility and disutility for buyers and super developers \nBought-in middleware utility \nBuyer\/Publisher rapid time-to-market \nswift exploitation of fashionable\/lucrative franchise \nreduced costs \nenables concentration on content and design \nenables large amounts of art assets to be modelled and archived \nreduced risk \nSuper developer enable rapid and potentially lucrative work-for-hire projects providing \nresources to  maintain integrity of core development teams \nBought-in middleware dis-utility \nBuyer\/Publisher restricts innovation \ndanger of generic game mechanics \nSuper developer reduces developers to status of aggregators \nincreases development process complexity and risk \nincreases transparency of project costs \nreduces product differentiation \n \nExplicit buyer dimensions \nThe super developer strategy discussed above has the buyer in the role of revealer of the \nvalue inherent in the knowledge that underpins the game engines, amongst other \ntechnological capabilities. In other words, buyers value the dynamic capabilities of the super \ndevelopers. This is not surprising as product life cycles are immensely short in the games \nmarket. Super developers, therefore, maintain and leverage core proprietary technologies in \norder to differentiate themselves from others seeking to develop the buyers\u2019 original character \nand franchise assets. Whilst middleware utility is appreciated, for super developers, its use \nmakes it difficult to add value to publisher assets, at least for current generation products. The \nproduct service offering, therefore, is informed by super developers\u2019 value strategy. This is \ndetermined by a combination of matching the known value criteria of publishers with the \nstrategic imperative of the super developer which involves development of high-value assets \nboth internally (proprietary technology) and externally (characters and franchises). It is not \nexclusively market led. Super developers give themselves the option to choose what \u2013 and for \nwhom \u2013 to develop.  \n 22 \nBuyers contribute along all three dimensions: signalling, revealing and collaborating. The \nfocus of this paper has been on revealing. Hence a few explanatory paragraphs on signalling \nand collaborating functions is necessary. \nSignallers \nBuyers of video games \u2013 publishers \u2013 are essentially contract managers who offer IP \ndevelopment for tender to contractors. However, they purchase licences from IP owners such \nas book publishers and Hollywood studios. The decision to offer IP for tender is based on \nextensive research on global gaming and gaming trends (many games, characters and \nfranchises are culturally specific). Consequently, inherent in the tender offer, is the output of \nthis research that gives a raft of indicators to developers about the industry.   \nCollaborators \nAs collaborators, publishers and console owners may be integral members of the \ndevelopment team. In the case of Microsoft Xbox this serves a number of functions. As a new \nentrant in the console market, it enables Microsoft to build relationships with content \nproviders. Collaboration enhances capability for both platform owners and development \nstudios. Collaborative relationships also deliver a timely product and improve quality (one \nfeature of the collaboration is ongoing testing of product versions) and prevent or limit \nfeature creep (too many features being added). Microsoft seduced developers in the first \ninstance by offering its development kits free of charge in exchange for development licences \nto complement its in-house effort. \nIn addition, Microsoft created an Advanced Technology Group which functions to ensure \nproduct quality through technical support, architecture, network and performance auditing, \nhosting and organising events and liaison with or on-site support for technology managers \nwithin development companies. As one developer noted: \nIn my experience with Microsoft I have found them to be extremely confident \nregarding the future of Xbox...but I\u2019ve also found them amazingly humble, enough to \nconstantly sit back and listen and learn from all the developers around them in North \nAmerica and Europe who know how to make games. This is ultimately why they \nremain a force now and in the future. They listen, learn and advise, but never preach. \nHowever, there is always an underlying ruthlessness in everything they do. (Hawley, \n2003) \n 23 \nIn some respects, Microsoft is using its superior market position in the value chain as both \nsupplier (technology console) and buyer (publisher) to upgrade their own technological \ncapabilities. The super developer, aware of this learning strategy, may not be willing to \nimpart design and development capabilities to their buyer (Thomke and von Hippel, 2002) \nbut may not be in a position to deny this development  from occurring. \nSummary and conclusions \nTable 5 summarises the buyer framework of the super developers and the publishers in the \nUK video games industry.  \nTable 5: Buyer roles and corresponding strategy frameworks  \nBuyer role Examples from UK VGI super developers \nSignaller Publishers offering tenders for character development; for example, \ncharacters featured in a Hollywood franchise. Through due diligence.  \nRevealer Re-use, enhancement and development of proprietary \u2018engines\u2019 and \nother development tools. \nCollaborator Publishers providing technical support relating to platforms, \ndevelopment process (e.g. Microsoft Xbox Advanced Technology \nTeam).  \n \n \nThis framework is not, we suggest, only applicable to digital industries such as video games. \nIndeed, the authors were alerted to its significance in empirical work with a cluster of \ncompanies in the South East of England who design and manufacture pumps for the water \nand medical sectors. In the video game industry particular insights arise from at least five \nfactors. First, the nature of a customer (the buyer as a governor of the value chain); second, \nthe fast changing technological capabilities of the platforms on which the products are \n\u2018ported\u2019; third, the innovation demands of publishers and game players; fourth, the \nephemerality of the game (the product life is very short); and fifth, the strategic sense of \nsuper developers with an ability to act on both explicit signals and implicit revelations from \nclients.  \nAll firms can compete and upgrade by following market-based and\/or resource-based \nframeworks (or a combination of both). From a market-based view, firms will identify their \nmarket position before aligning their internal resource base. From a resource-based view, a \nstrategy evolves from the internal resources that are strategic (i.e. valuable, rare and \n 24 \ntransferable). Industry forces can influence the choice of strategy while internal resources \nreflect the ability to:  \n\u2022 respond directly to these forces to effect change, and  \n\u2022 re-configure and move to a new offering (Spanos and Lioukas, 2001). \nBesides commercial transactions, buyers can contribute in three different ways in the \ninnovation process:  as signallers, revealers and collaborators (see Table 6 above). In our \nsample of UK video games super developers, buyers:  \n\u2022 signal their demand for innovative products above other value criteria;  \n\u2022 reveal to the firm which resources and capabilities are strategic; \n\u2022 collaborate over new products and technologies.  \nEach buyer strategy has the potential to provide firms with sustained competitive advantage \nand, while direct buyer collaboration suggests higher rents will be earned for firms leading \nfrom a strategic resource base, no route should be ignored. Satisfying buyers in the short-term \nrequires the fulfilment of value criteria specifications. In the long term, the speed of \ntechnological change raises the need for firms to lead rather than respond to demand, albeit \nagainst the backdrop of the formulation of a strategy being time dependent. Strategic \nresources and capabilities have first to be identified. A viable strategy can evolve from this \nresource base. Finally, collaboration can benefit both buyers and firms so long as the \npotential opportunity is clear.  \nApplying this to an analysis of strategic management in the video game industry, data from \nUK super developers demonstrates that the challenge is to muster and channel resources into \ndelivering on the value criteria specified by publishers, however contradictory they may be. \nWhilst the short-term imperative is to deliver titles on time and budget, this can only be done \nin the context of a medium- and long-term innovation strategy involving the development of \nnew IP, enhancement of software technologies and production and business processes.  \nSuper developers, we argue, command resources that are strategic; namely, those which are \nvaluable, rare (skilled labour) and transferable (expertise and know-how). For super \ndevelopers, valuable resources include technology IP (game engines); rare resources are \nexemplified in skilled labour \u2013 coders and designers; and transferable resources encapsulate \nexpertise and know-how (diffused between development teams). The key resource is labour \nwhich creates value primarily through coding and design. Coders create the valuable \n 25 \nproprietary technology. Designers compose the form of the game with its layers and \ngameplay.  \nThe three strategy frameworks present opportunities for all firms in value chains, and are not \nmutually exclusive. Should it be desirable to move out of the current market and apply their \ncapabilities to other types of media or for an entirely new buyer chain, innovating with \nexisting buyers may not be appropriate as market dependencies could hinder such movement. \nNotwithstanding this caution, buyer data present firms with potential intelligence on which to \nbase upgrading decisions for competitive advantage. In applying this model to a new-\nengineering business environment, where knowledge is the defining resource, it is clear that \nsustainability may depend absolutely on managers\u2019 foresight and ability to reconfigure \ninternal resources against the logic of the market and short-term buyer preferences. This \nrequires firms to attain a high level of capabilities to collect, analyse and articulate new \nstrategies and, increasingly, capabilities to implement quickly these new strategies. How \nfirms develop these capabilities is a neglected area and future research is required, \nparticularly in high velocity sectors such as the video game industry. However, UK super \ndevelopers have shown themselves to be adept at aligning their strategy with the development \nand ownership of character and franchise IP \u2013 the key resource in the sector.  \nReferences \nAoyama, Y. and Izushi, H.
