Introduction \nWetting is often the primary factor governing whether or not a coating will adhere and bond to a \nsubstrate. In practical applications where vitreous enamels are fired onto mild steels, the performance \nof the article is directly linked to the nature of the enamel-steel interface. Consequently, both \nscientists and engineers alike have a great interest in understanding the interfacial phenomena \nbetween vitreous enamels and mild steels. Many studies to investigate these phenomena have been \ncarried out, however, they have been principally concerned with the wettability of zirconia and other \noxide ceramics on metals [1-5], as well as the adhesion of silicone sealants to aluminium [6] and the \ncoating of aluminium alloys with ceramic materials [7, 8]. The interfacial mechanisms investigated \nhave centred principally around the thermodynamic criterion [2, 3, 5], the electronic theory [4] and \nthe occurrence of oxidation [1, 9]. \nLasers can offer the user not only an exceedingly high degree of process controllability, but also a \ngreat deal of process flexibility. Yet at present, very little published work exists pertaining to the use \nof lasers for altering the surface properties of materials in order to improve their wettability \ncharacteristics. Nevertheless, it is recognised within the currently published work that laser \nirradiation of a metal surface can bring about changes in the metal\u2019s wettability characteristics. \nPreviously Zhou et al. [7, 8] have carried out work on laser coating of aluminium alloys with ceramic \nmaterials (SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), reporting on the well documented fact that generated oxide layers often \npromote metal\/oxide wetting. Also, Heitz et al. [10] and Olfert et al. [11] have found that excimer \nlaser treatment of metals results in improved coating adhesion. The improvements in adhesion were \nattributed to the fact that the excimer laser treatment resulted in a smoother surface and as such \nenhanced the action of wetting.  \nHowever, the reasons for these changes with regard to changes in the material\u2019s surface morphology, \nsurface composition and surface energy are not reported. In contrast,. Lawrence and Li have amply \ndemonstrated the practicability of employing different types of lasers to effect changes in the \nwettability characteristics of ceramics [12-14] and metals [15, 16] for improved adhesion and \nbonding.  \nThis present work details the use of a novel 1.2 kW high power diode laser (HPDL) to alter the \nwettability characteristics of a common engineering mild steel, and the effects thereof on the \nadhesion and bonding characteristics with a vitreous enamel. The intention being to facilitate the \nhitherto impossible task of enamelling mild steel in normal atmospheric conditions without pre-\ntreatment of the steel. Indeed, such a process has been employed by the authors to enable the sealing, \nby means of laser enamelling, of ceramic tile grouts [17-19]. \n 2. Experimental procedures \nThe laser used in the study was a 1.2 kW HPDL (Rofin-Sinar, DL-012), emitting at 940 nm. The laser \nbeam was focused directly onto the samples to a 6 mm x 20 mm rectangular beam with a fixed power \nof 500 W. The laser head assembly and focusing optics are shown schematically in Fig. 1. The beam \nwas traversed across the samples by means of mounting the  assembly head onto the z-axis of a 3-axis \nCNC table. The focused laser beam was thus fired across the surface of the mild steel by traversing \nthe samples beneath the laser beam using the x- and y-axis of the CNC table at speeds of 250-2000 \nmm\/min, whilst 8 l\/min of coaxially blown O2 gas was used to assist the surface treatment process. \nThe liquids used for the wetting experiments were human blood, human blood plasma, glycerol and          \n4-octanol. The test liquids, along with their total surface energy ( \u03b3 2 ) as well as the dispersive ( \u03b3 2\nd ) \nand polar ( \u03b3 2\np ) components, are detailed elsewhere [13]. An additional set of wetting experiments \nwere conducted to simply determine the contact angle between the enamel and the mild steel before \nand after laser treatment. \nThe solid materials used as substrates in the wetting experiments were rectangular billets (50 x      \n100 mm\n2\n with a thickness of 3 mm) of common engineering low carbon mild steel (EN8). The contact \nsurfaces of the materials were used as-received in the experiments  \nThe wetting experiments were carried out in atmospheric conditions at a temperature of 200C. The \ndroplets were released in a controlled manner onto the surface of the mild steel substrate (treated and \nuntreated) from the tip of a micropipette, with the resultant volume of the drops being approximately \n6 x 10-3 cm3. Each experiment lasted for three minutes with profile photographs of the sessile drops \nbeing obtained every minute, with the contact angle subsequently being measured using Vislog 5 \nimage processing software to an accuracy of \u00b10.1\n0\n. The experimental results showed that throughout \nthe period of the tests no discernible change in the magnitude of the contact angle occurred.  \n3. Contact angle and wettability characteristics \nAn optical micrograph of a sessile drop of enamel (200C) placed on the surface of the mild steel \nbefore (a) and after (b) HPDL irradiation with the contact angle superimposed is shown in Fig. 2. The \nHPDL modified sample depicted in Fig. 2 was treated with a laser power of 500 W at a rate of         \n1500 mm\/min in an O2 atmosphere. As one can see from Fig. 2, HPDL irradiation of the mild steel \nsurface effected a considerable reduction in the enamel contact angle.  \n \n 3.1. The effects of surface roughness \nOne explanation for this observed reduction in the enamel contact angle is that the surface obtained \nafter laser treatment was somewhat smoother than the original untreated surface. The influence of the \nsubstrate surface roughness on the wetting contact angle is also of great importance, being described \nby Wenzel\u2019s equation: \n       ( )r sv sl lv w\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b8\u2212 = cos  (1) \nwhere, r is the roughness factor defined as the ratio of the real and apparent surface areas, \u03b3sv is the \nsolid surface energy, \u03b3sl is the solid-liquid surface energy and \u03b8w is the contact angle for the wetting of \na rough surface. Clearly, as Eq. (1) shows, the influence of surface roughness on the contact angle is \nto affect an increase in the contact angle. Thus, the smoother the contact surface is, the smaller the \ncontact angle will be. \nThe mean surface roughness (Ra) value of the surface of the as-received mild steel was 1.46 \u00b5m, \nwhilst for the HPDL treated mild steel surface the mean Ra value was 1.12 \u00b5m. Similar laser induced \nsurface smoothing effects were obtained by Nicolas et al. [20] and Henari et al. [21], who observed \nthat excimer laser treatment of ceramics and metals could result in the generation of a smoother \nsurface. Therefore, according to Eq. (1), the smoother surface will inherently result in a reduction in \nthe contact angle.  \nIndeed, this fact is borne out somewhat by Fig. 3, which shows that the surface condition of the mild \nsteel resulting from HPDL modification (with a number of different traverse speeds) greatly affected \nthe measured contact angle. As one can see from Fig. 3, at relatively low traverse speeds excess \nenergy is deposited on the surface of the mild steel resulting in a high level of surface melting. This \nin turn causes porosities and a generally rough surface profile. As the traverse speed increases, \nhowever, the energy deposited on the surface of the mild steel reduces. Accordingly the degree of \nsurface melting reduces ultimately to the optimum degree, resulting in the minimum surface \nroughness, and contact angle, at around 1500 mm\/min. Beyond this point the surface roughness, and \ncontact angle, can be seen to increase, indicating that insufficient melting, and consequently \nsmoothing, was achieved. Such results are in accord with those obtained by Feng et al. [22], who \nnoted that under certain surface conditions, contact angle reduction was inversely proportional to \nsurface roughness. Moreover, Olfert et al. [11] found that excimer laser treatment of steel surfaces \ngreatly improved the adhesion of a zinc coating. They asserted that laser treatment occasioned the \nsmoothing of many of the high frequency surface features, resulting in more complete wetting by the \nzinc. \n3.2. The effects of surface O2 content \n In addition to the above, the improvement in the wetting action experienced by the mild steel can be \nascribed in some part to the increase in the surface O2 content of the mild steel following HPDL \ntreatment; since this is known to increase the likelihood of wetting [1, 9]. Indeed, since wetting is \ngoverned by the first atomic layers of the surface of a material, the O2 content at the surface of the \nmild steel before and after HPDL treatment was determined using XPS. In a sample treated with a \nlaser power of 500 W at a rate of 1500 mm\/min and in an O2 atmosphere, the surface O2 content was \nfound to have increased after HPDL treatment from 34at% to 40at%. Clearly, oxidisation of the \nHPDL treated surface of the mild steel has occurred. This indicates that O2 enrichment of the laser \ntreated mild steel surface was active in promoting wetting and adhesion [1, 9]. \n3.3. Surface energy and its dispersive\/polar characteristics \nThe adhesion energy of a liquid to a solid surface (the work of adhesion), Wad, is given by the Young-\nDupre equation: \n                    ( )Wad lv= +\u03b3 \u03b81 cos  (2) \nThe intermolecular attraction which is responsible for surface energy, \u03b3, results from a variety of \nintermolecular forces whose contribution to the total surface energy is additive [23]. The majority of \nthese forces are functions of the particular chemical nature of a certain material, and as such the total \nsurface energy (\u03b3) comprises of \u03b3p (polar or non-dispersive interaction) and \u03b3d (dispersive component). \nTherefore, the surface energy of any system may be described by [23] \n                        \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3= +d p  (3) \nAs such, Wad can be expressed as the sum of the different intermolecular forces that act at the \ninterface [23]: \n ( ) ( )W W Wad add adp svd lvd svp lvp= + = +2 2\n1 2 1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\/ \/\n (4) \nBy equating Eq. (4) with Eq. (2), the contact angle for solid-liquid systems can be related to the \nsurface energies of the respective liquid and solid by \n             \n( ) ( )\ncos\n\/ \/\n\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n+\n\u2212\n2 2\n1\n1 2 1 2\nsv\nd\nlv\nd\nsv\np\nlv\np\nlv\n (5) \n It is possible to estimate the dispersive component of the mild steel\u2019s surface energy,\u03b3 sv\nd\n, by using \nEq. (5), and plotting the graph of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv. Fig. 4 shows the best fit plots for the \nuntreated and HPDL treated steel. The laser parameters used were a laser power of 500 W, a rate of \n1500 mm\/min and an O2 atmosphere. The surface roughness and surface O2 content resulting from \nprocessing under these conditions were 1.12 \u00b5m and 40at% respectively. Thus the value of\u03b3 sv\nd\n is \nestimated by the gradient (=2(\u03b3 sv\nd\n)1\/2) of the line which connects the origin (cos \u03b8 = -1) with the \nintercept point of the straight line (cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv) correlating the data point with the \nabscissa at cos \u03b8 = 1 [24]. The value of \u03b3 sv\nd\n for the untreated and HPDL treated (1500 mm\/min \ntraverse speed) mild steel is shown in Table 1. From the best-fit plots of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv, it \nwas found that the ordinate intercept point of the untreated mild steel-liquid system was closer to    \ncos \u03b8 = -1 than that of the HPDL treated mild steel-liquid system. This indicates that, in principle, \ndispersion forces are acting mainly at the mild steel-liquid interface, resulting in poor adhesion [24, \n25]. In contrast, the best-fit straight line for the HPDL treated mild steel-liquid system intercepted the \nordinate considerably higher above the origin. This is indicative of the action of polar forces across \nthe interface, in addition to dispersion forces, hence improved wettability and adhesion is promoted \n[24, 25]. \nIt is not possible to determine the value of the polar component of the mild steel\u2019s surface energy, \n\u03b3 sv\np\n, directly from plots of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv.  This is because the intercept of the straight line \n(cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv) is at ( )2\n1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3sv\np\nlv\np\n\/\n\/\u03b3lv, and thus only refers to individual control liquids and \nnot the control liquid system. However, it has been established that the entire amount of the surface \nenergies due to dispersion forces either of the solids or the liquids are active in the wettability \nperformance [24, 26]. It is therefore possible to calculate the dispersive component of the work of \nadhesion, Wad\nd\n, from Eq. (4). The results revealed that for each particular control liquid in contact \nwith both the untreated and laser treated mild steel surfaces, Wad  could be correlated with Wad\nd\n by a \nlinear relationship. \n         W aW bad ad\nd= +  (6) \nwhere a and b are constants unique to each control liquid system. A linear relationship between the \ndispersive and polar components of the control test liquids surface energies exists, thus  \n                                          ( ) ( )\u03b3 \u03b3lvp lvd\n1 2 1 2\n0 45 13\n\/ \/\n. .= +  (7) \n By introducing (6) into (3) and rearranging, then \n  ( )W a W bad\np\nad\nd= \u2212 +1  (8) \nor \n        ( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( )\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3svp lvp svd lvda\nb1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\n1\n2\n\/ \/ \/ \/\n= \u2212 +  (9) \nBy introducing (7) into (9) and differentiating with respect to ( )\u03b3 lvd\n1 2\/\n, considering that ( )\u03b3 svd\n1 2\/\n and \n( )\u03b3 svp\n1 2\/\nare constant, then the following is valid: \n  ( )\n( ) ( )\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nsv\np sv\nd a1 2\n1 2\n1\n13\n\/\n\/\n.\n=\n\u2212\n (10) \nSince\u03b3 sv\nd\n has already been determined for the untreated and laser treated mild steel from the plots of \nEq. (5), it is possible to calculate \u03b3 sv\np\n for untreated and laser treated mild steel using Eq. (10) (see \nTable 1). \nAs Table 1 clearly shows, HPDL treatment of the surface of the mild steel has led to a small increase \nin the polar component of the surface energy,\u03b3 sv\np\n, thus improving the action of wetting and adhesion. \nIt is surmised that this increase may be due to HPDL induced changes in the surface microstructure of \nthe mild steel.  \nIt is important to note that because of the long range ionic interactions in the mild steel and the \ncomposite nature of the interfaces between the mild steel and the control liquids, it is highly likely \nthat the thermodynamically defined total solid surface energy, \u03b3, as defined in Eq. (3), will be higher \nthan the sum of the dispersive, \u03b3d, and the polar, \u03b3p, components of the surface energy. Although the \nincrease in (excess) surface free energy will probably be less than the increase in the total lattice \nenergy. On the other hand, an absorbed liquid layer may shield the ionic fields substantially. As such, \nall the data derived from Equations (4) - (10) should be considered as being semi-empirical. \nNotwithstanding this, as the studies by Gutowski et al.[6] and Agathopoulos et al. [14] found, it is \nreasonable to conclude from the data obtained from Equations (4) - (10) that HPDL treatment of the \nmild steel surface has caused a small increase in the polar component, \u03b3p, of the surface energy. \n \n 4. Conclusions \nHigh power diode laser (HPDL) surface treatment of the EN8 mild steel resulted in changes in the \nwettability characteristics of the mild steel and the enamel. Improvements in the wetting action of the \nmild steel after HPDL surface treatment were identified as being the result of a number of factors. \nFirstly, the HPDL induced melting of the mild steel surface which brought about a reduction of the \nsurface roughness, thus directly reducing the contact angle, \u03b8. Secondly, the small increase in the \npolar component of the surface energy,\u03b3 sv\np\n, after HPDL treatment (which is thought to be due to the \nHPDL effected microstructural changes), thus improving the action of wetting and adhesion. Finally, \nthe increase in the surface O2 content of the mild steel resulting from HPDL treatment was identified \nas further promoting the action of wetting. This work demonstrates that it is distinctly possible to \nalter the wetting characteristics of the selected mild steel using the HPDL.  \n \n References \n1. M. Ueki, M. Naka, I.
