Introduction \n \nTourism as an industry requires a diverse range of information and lends itself well to the \nsupport offered by developing multimedia, communication technologies and information \nsystems (Sheldon, 1993; Poon, 1993; Cho, 1998). Therefore, Information Communication \nTechnologies (ICTs) have been changing the global tourism industry rapidly. The \nimplications of the Internet and other growing interactive multimedia platforms for \ntourism promotion are far reaching and alter the structure of the industry. As tourism \nplays a significant role for the Greek economy (Buhalis, 2001), this research aimed to \nexplore the impact of ICTs and the Internet in particular for the future competitiveness of \nthe destination and its Small and Medium-sized Tourism Enterprises (SMTEs). The EU \n(2003) defines SMEs as organisations that employ less than 250 people and have less \nthan \u20ac 50 million turnover or \u20ac 43 million Balance Sheet in total. In the absence of \nprevious research on the topic, this paper explores the current state of eTourism \ndevelopments of the Greek tourism industry and examines the use of the Internet in \nSMTEs. In addition, it investigates a number of issues related to eTourism developments \nin Greece, including: levels of tourism establishments using the Internet and eCommerce \npenetration and usage; linkages in the marketplace; degree of online co-operation for \ntourism industry players; and the intention of key industry players towards the \ndevelopment of a Destination Management System. The paper also assesses how \neTourism concepts and techniques can contribute towards the improvement of the Greek \ntourism competitiveness, whilst it identifies transferable lessons for other regions around \nthe world.  \n \n2 Literature review \n \nA number of different disciplines contribute to the issues studied in this paper. Academic \nresearch and publications in Innovation Diffusion, Information Communication \nTechnologies, eCommerce, Strategic Management and Marketing, as well as Tourism \nManagement and Marketing and Tourism in Greece were revised to provide the contextual \nframework for the research. The literature review therefore focuses on the impacts of \nICTs on tourism and the eCommerce developments in Greece. It also includes a brief \nsection on Tourism in Greece which provide the contextual environment that determine \nthe requirements for eTourism in the country. \n \n- 4 -\n2.1 Diffusion of innovation and ICT\/eCommerce developments \n \nThe theoretical context of diffusion of innovation, as introduced by Rogers (1995, 1976) \ncan explain a whole range of processes experience in the ICT\/eCommerce adoption. \nDiffusion of innovation is the process by which an innovation is communicated through \ndifferent channels over time among members of a social system. Innovation diffusion \nincludes four main elements. The innovation itself can be idea, object, practice, process \nthat is perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. Communication \nChannels are used to transfer the messages between individuals by which innovation is \ncommunicated and announced. Time is also critical as it determines the time that an \ninnovation-decision process requires, the relative time with which an innovation is adopted \nby an individual or group, and finally the innovation rate of adoption. The social system \nprovides the set of interrelated units engaged in joint problem solving to accomplish a \ncommon goal and includes the cultural elements that can encourage or discourage \ninnovation. Research has shown that society\u2019s use of innovations increases, and evolves, \nover time and the model can be extended to organisations (Damanpour 1991).  \n \nInnovation diffusion includes several different stages, which can be summarised in the \nfollowing points: Firstly knowledge indicates the exposure to the existence of the \ninnovation and  the understanding of its functions. This can include awareness knowledge \nthat innovation exists; knowledge on how to use the innovation properly and principle \nknowledge underlying how the innovation works. Secondly, persuasion indicates the \nforming of a favourable attitude towards innovation and interest in exploring the \nmechanisms and requirements of adoption. It also demonstrates an element of expected \nbenefits from the adoption Thirdly a decision indicates the commitment to adopt \ninnovation and to invest towards its deployment. Fourthly the implementation stage is \nconcerned with how innovation is put into use. Finally a confirmation stage provides a \nreinforcement of the innovation based on positive outcomes from its usage (Rogers 1995). \n \nOrganisations often adopt innovation for a variety of reasons. Sometimes these are not \nrational and well-determined factors but irrational and personal image factors such as \nfashion, imitation, curiosity, novelty and bandwagon effects (McBride, 1997; Murphy et al. \n2003). In addition, the pressure from sales people to adopt a piece meal approach to \ntechnology is also evident frequently. As a result, often organisations adopt inappropriate \nor incomplete set of technologies rather than be seen as laggards and fear of being \ndifferent (Raymond, 2001; Abrahamson 1991; Wolfe 1994). These irrationalities can lead \nto an assimilation gap (Fichman 2000). This is often reflected in the tourism industry and \nthe perceived barriers to effectively implementation of Internet technologies (Heung 2003; \nW\u00f6ber, 2003; Peacock 1994).  \n \nInnovation characteristics, adopter characteristics and social influences shape the speed of \ntechnology adoption by individuals. Innovation Diffusion is faster if potential adopters \nperceive the innovation to have a perceived relative advantage over the idea, object, \npractice , process it supersedes. Compatibility with existing values, past experiences and \nneeds can also speed the diffusion speed. Simplicity of the innovation and the ability \nunderstand and use the innovation without having to go through difficult procedures also \ninfluences the rate of diffusion. The degree to which innovation can be experimented with \non a limited basis and with a limited financial commitment is also another significant \nfactor. Finally, the visibility of expected and perceived benefits in early adopters is a major \ndeterminant for the rate of diffusion. Figure 1 illustrate the different types of innovation \nadopters and their characteristics.  \n- 5 -\nFigure 1: Innovation adopters and their characteristics \nADOPTER \nCATEGORIES \nPERCENTA\nGE \nSHARED CHARACTERISTICS \nInnovators 2.5% Innovators require a shorter adoption period than any other \ngroup.  They are often risk takers that can identify innovations \nand they can cope with a high degree of uncertainty. They are \noften pay for unprofitable innovations.   \nEarly Adopters 13.5% Early Adopters are often opinion leaders and demonstrate \nupward social mobility. They are often successful and are \nrespected by peers. Innovation adoption is seen as part of \ntheir success. \nEarly Majority 34% The Early Majority adopters interact frequently with peers and \ndeliberate before adopting a new idea. They seldom hold \npositions of opinion leadership.  \nLate Majority 34% The Late Majority adopters respond to peer pressure and \neconomic necessity. They are sceptical, cautious and risk \nadverse. \nLaggards 16% Laggards are often isolated and often cherish the past rather \nthan the future. They are suspicious of change and \ninnovations and have limited resources for innovation. \nSource: Adapted from Rogers, 1995 \n \nA number of models have emerged in the last few years to explain the gradual \ndevelopment and deployment of ICTs and eCommerce in organisations as illustrated in \nFigure 2. They demonstrate that organisations are at different levels of e-commerce take-\nup, often defined as tiers or steps (Cisco, 2000). Although not all organisations follow the \nsame steps, it is argued that these are the major stages of ICT\/eCommerce adoption. \n \nFigure 2: e-Adoption Ladder  \n \nS tep 3 : \nB asic W eb  \nsite  and \ne-m ail\nS tep  4 :\nE ffective  \nw eb site\nS tep 5\nT ransactions\n &  eCom m erce\nS tep 6  \nIntegrated\neB usin ess\nS tep 7 :\ntransform ed\no rgan isations\nB usiness\nstages\nand\nben efits\nExtent o f o rganisation al change  &  sophistication\n- B as ic web s ite\no ffering on lin e\nbrochu re\n- e ffic ient\nin ternal and\nexterna l\ncom m unica tions\nthrou gh email\n-Effective  and\nin teractive\nw eb s ite\n- p lace in\nw orldw ide\nm arket\n- w indow  on\nw orldw ide\nsupp lie rs\n- o rder and pay\nonline, reduc ing\ntransact ion\ncosts\n- m axim ise\naccess ib ility and\nspeed\n- in tegra te\nsupp ly  cha in\nso\nm anu factu re\nand de livery\nbecom e\nseam less\n- m in im ise\nw aste  a t every\nstage o f the\nsupp ly  cha in\n- open system s\nof in form ation  for\ncustom ers,\nsu pplie rs and\npartners\n- new business\nm ode ls based on\nin terworking\nbetween\norgan isa tions and\nind iv idua ls\nA dapted from  C isco led  In form ation A ge Partnersh ip study on e-com m erce in  sm all business\nS tep 2 :\nInternal \nsystem s\nand passive  \nIntern et\n- bas ic  in te rnal\nsystem s fo r\naccoun ting and\nw ord processing\n- access to\nIn ternet\nS tep1:\nS tarting  \npo int\n- L im ited\nexposure to\nICTs and\neCom m erce and\nin terest to  learn\nm ore\n- 6 -\neCIC (2003) explains that eCommerce is always evolving and it can be difficult for SMEs to \ndetermine just where on the evolutionary path they are. The eCommerce ladder enables \nSMEs to determine where they are and what they need to do develop their \ncompetitiveness. On the eCommerce ladder, SMEs don't need to progress from 1 step to \nanother. Depending on business needs, certain stages may be jumped as more advanced \nuses of eCommerce are taken on board. \n \n2.2 Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) in Tourism \n \nNew technologies have been changing the way in which tourism companies conduct their \nbusiness and how the entire system operates (O\u2019Connor, 1999, Werthner and Klein, 1999, \nConnell and Reynolds, 1999). The dynamic growth of the use of ICTs results in dramatic \nchanges in the structure and operations of travel and tourism industries. Changes are \nparticularly obvious in the way that tourism organisations communicate with their \nindividual and institutional clients and how they manage their distribution function. These \ndevelopments present a major opportunity for innovative tourism organisations and \ndestinations to improve their relative position in the international market. By embracing \nnew and innovative business models and electronic commerce (eCommerce) they can \nextend their distribution channel and expand their value chain dramatically.  \n \neTourism therefore is emerging as a way forward for many destinations and organisations \naround the world. At the tactical level, it includes eCommerce and ICTs for maximising the \ninternal efficiency and effectiveness of tourism organisations. At the strategic level, \neTourism revolutionises all business processes, the entire value chain as well as the \nstrategic relationships of tourism organisations with all their stakeholders. The Internet \nallows tourism organisations to interact with all their stakeholders, including potential and \nloyal customers, local groups and public authorities. By taking advantage of intranets \n(internal systems that are accessed by employees) organisations can reengineer internal \nprocesses, whilst extranets can support the development of close relationships with \ntrusted partners that can lead to on-line transactions, expansion of the distribution \nchannel and extension of the value chain. Hence, eTourism will increasingly determine the \ncompetitiveness of the organisation (Buhalis, 2003). \n \nMarcussen (2003) demonstrates that the online travel sales reached 7.6 billion Euros in \nthe European market in 2002 and is expected to reach 17.6bn by 2006. This represented \na market share of 3.6% of the overall travel sales market. By the year 2006 the market \nshare of online travel sales will reach 7.4% of the European market. The UK and Germany \nremained the largest online travel markets, constituting 38% and 22% of the European \nonline travel market, respectively. Greece along with Italy, Spain and Portugal are the \nsmallest online markets, as constituted only 8% of total Europeans. It is therefore evident \nthat eTourism in maturing fast as a mainstream distribution mechanism. Competition in \n\"cyberspace\" tourism marketing is increasing dramatically on both domestic and \ninternational levels. Establishing Internet presence and eCommerce strategies, for both \nmicro and macro levels, will increasingly become critical for destinations to remain \ncompetitive. \n \nThe literature on the diffusion of ICTs and eCommerce in the tourism industry is growing \n(Werthner and Klein, 1999; Sheldon, 1997; O'Connor, 1999). A number of research studies \nregarding online developments relating to the tourism industry have been conducted \nworld-wide (Countryman, 1999). Most of them predominantly focus on technologically \nadvanced European countries and the United States and mainly reflect the situation in \nlarge tourism organisations. However, eCommerce and Internet diffusion varies \ntremendously between countries and size of organisations (Werthner and Klein, 1999). \nMost of the eTourism literature therefore has failed to research these issues in countries \n- 7 -\nwith different development levels, such as Greece. There is not explicit information \ntherefore to indicate whether Greek tourist enterprises are connected to the Internet or \nwhether they provide their products and services online.  \n \n2.3 ICT Developments and eCommerce in Greece \n \nTo contextualise eTourism in Greece an examination of Electronic Commerce \n(eCommerce) is required. eCommerce has emerged as a global phenomenon and is \ngradually increases its marketshare. Since the early 2000s the market has demonstrated \nclear indications of maturity, as many of the Internet bubbles bursted leaving behind \norganisations with viable business models. Although the USA and a number of \neconomically developed countries experience eCommerce maturity, many regions still \nstruggle in terms of Internet and electronic commerce utilisation. Indeed, the vast \nmajority of the world population does not have access to the Internet and lacks the \ntechnological skills and knowledge to do so.  \n \nAs far as the demand\/consumption side is concerned, the figures in relation to Internet \nand electronic commerce adoption in Greece are not very optimistic. eCommerce in \nGreece is found in its infancy stages of growth. It clearly presents a delay of five years in \nrelation to main European markets (Braliev and Yatromalakis, 2002). Consumer \neCommerce \"remains largely embryonic throughout the region as only 12% of Internet \nusers or 3.5% of the Greek population buy products online (Stat Bank, 2002). However, \nthere are clear indications that education is propelling the use of ICTs in all levels as a \nlarger proportion of the younger generation use ICTs habitually. \n \n\u2022 During 2001, 50% of the Greek population used mobile phones, 20% used a personal \ncomputer (PC) and only 10% used the Internet. However these figures almost doubled in \n2002 demonstrating the fast pace of Internet diffusion in Greece.  \n\u2022 The percentage of Internet penetration for the first time passed 10% of the population \n(over 15 years of age) at the end of the first half of 2001 and it was expected to exceed \n12% by the end of the same year (CORDIS, 2002). \n\u2022 A large proportion of new Internet users emerge, as 75% started using the network \nsince the year 2000 (Karounos and Goussiou, 2001; Papazafeiropoulou et. al., 2001). \n \nThe development of Internet penetration in Greece and the European Union for the period \n1999-2004 is illustrated in Figure 3. The difference amongst Greece and the European \nUnion is evident throughout the mentioned years. For the year 2004, Greece estimates \nhave been based on two different scenarios relative to the mode of Internet growth. The \nfirst scenario assumes that a constant growth rate will be maintained, whereas the second \nis based on exponential rates, equivalent to those undergone by the mobile market in \nGreece during its launch years. It is argued that for the Greek Internet market to acquire \nthe crucial impulse, certain essential obstacles need to be defeated. The most significant \nappears to be the limited use of personal computers. The prediction of fast infiltration of \nmobile telephony will constitute the vaulting horse for the growth of Internet, is also \ndoubtful. The Greek public does not use mobile Internet services (WAP), because Internet \naccess via mobile telephones still confronts technical difficulties (Karounos and Goussiou, \n2001). \n- 8 -\nFigure 3  Internet use in Greece and the European Union  \n20%\n25.70%\n34.30%\n66%\n49.40%\n67.50%\n5.50% 7.30% 10.10%\n1999 2000 2001 2004\nEU Average\nGreece\nGreece,\nEstimate 1\nGreece,\nEstimate 2\nSource: Karounos and Goussiou, 2001: 10 \n \nHowever these predictions already seem outdated. By 2002 the National Research in \nInformation Technology and Information Society demonstrated that 67% of the Greek \npopulations were using personal computers, 20% used the Internet and 70% used a \nmobile phone (Infosoc, 2003). Therefore it is expected that a rapid growth on Internet \nuse will bring Greek Internet and eCommerce users to similar levels with other Europeans. \n \nOn the supply\/production side, eCommerce adoption is also in its infancy, particularly for \nSMEs. SMEs are of critical importance for Greece and the European Union in general (EU, \n2002b). Although SMEs represent more than 99% of the EU enterprises, their importance \nin the economy is not matched by their ability to use eBusiness tools. According to a \nbenchmarking project by the European Commission, the level of SMEs\u2019 utilisation of ICT in \nGreece is the lowest throughout Europe, as demonstrated in Table 1 (EU, 2002a). \n \nTable 1.

However, the public sector in Greece has failed to develop a comprehensive and \nserious approach to represent the country on the Internet. In 2000, the Greek National \nTourism Organisation (GNTO) presented its site \u2018Discover Greece\u2019 (www.gnto.gr). The \nGNTO\u2019s site offers information about a wide field of tourism activities, broken down into \n- 9 -\ntwo district categories: editorial content and data about specific products, services and \nproviders. The web site aimed to entice and inform the potential customer and included a \nwide range of tourism information on areas, events and attractions as well as \nphotographs, maps and posters. Editorial information is supported by data on tourism \nsuppliers, attractions, activities events and amenities (Trifona, 2001). Nevertheless, it \ndoes not offer online reservation facilities and fails to use a comprehensive Destination \nManagement System to manage information and to improve customer interfaces.  \n \n2.4 Tourism in Greece \n \nTo appreciate the ICT and eCommerce requirements of tourism in Greece a brief \nintroduction is required. Tourism in Greece has a long tradition and has rapidly expanded \nsince the 1960s. The country has been attracting tourists for many decades due to the \nextensive ancient historical attractions, cultural resources and good climate. Until the \n1970s it provided customers with an older heritage of important cultural and \narchaeological tourism resources (Briassoulis, 1993). Mass tourism came once the \nEuropean package holiday discovered the country\u2019s beauties and the \u2018sea, sun and sand\u2019 \ntourist attractions. Since then, a plethora of tourist destinations have grown rapidly, \nespecially island destinations that receive the majority of incoming tourist arrivals.  Greece \nis one of the most popular tourist destinations worldwide in terms of arrivals and it is \ncurrently ranked as the 15th most visited country by the World Tourism Organisation. An \nestimated 12.5 million visitors arrived in 2000. Most visitors (94%) originate from Europe \nand 70.4% from EU countries (WTO, 2001a). Tourism generates significant economic \nresources and it is critical for the economic structure especially in the peripheral and \ninsular regions where as much as 80% of the local GDP is often based on tourism. In \n2000, the average length of stay in the country was 10 days, while the average \nexpenditure per arrival reached a level of 727 US$ (GNTO, 2001a).  \n \nThe main countries of origin given in Figure 4 illustrates that British and Germans are the \npredominant markets, jointly contributing for almost 50% of all arrivals; followed by Italy, \nFrance and the Netherlands. Domestic tourism is also very important as Kappa Research \n(2002) found that 82% of Greeks take at least one domestic holiday yearly. As illustrated \nin Figure 5, more than 80% of visitors arrive by plane, with charter flights accounting for \napproximately 75% of the arrivals (GNTO, 2001a). With special reference to the two most \nimportant groups of incoming tourists, 84.2% of those arrived by air from the UK, came \nby charter flights while, the corresponding figure for Germans is slightly lower reaching \nalmost 78% (GNTO, 2001a). This type of transport is favoured due to the relative isolation \nfrom the main originating European countries of departure. However, it creates a \ndependency to tour operators that own charter airlines (Wanhill, 1998).  \n- 10 -\nFigure 4  Main incoming markets \n5%\n18%\n21%\n6%4%4%\n5%\n37%\nFrance\nGermany\nUK\nItaly\nSweden \nAustria\nNetherlands\nOther\nSource: GNTO, 2001a \nFigure 5  Means of transport of incoming tourists for 2000 \nRoad\n13%\nSea\n6.5\n%\nRail\n0.5% Air\n80%\nCharter \nflights\n75%\nSchedule \nflights\n5%\nSource: GNTO, 2001a \n \nThe Greek tourism product is mainly distributed to incoming markets by international tour \noperators, such as TUI, Mytravel, ThomasCook. In addition, a number of smaller, \nspecialist operators such as Sunvil, Laskarina, Attica etc. also promote the country abroad. \nThe vast majority of the Greek tourism suppliers are SMTEs and suffer from functional and \nstructural weaknesses (Ioannides et al. 2001). Therefore, they depend almost entirely on \ntour operators for their communication with customers and visibility in their major markets \n(Buhalis, 2000; Briassoulis, 1993).  \n \nDespite its popularity and growth over the last 40 years, the Greek tourism industry has \nreached a stage where both its potentials and competitiveness have become questionable. \nAt the micro level, the European travel trade and intermediaries warn that the Greek \ntourism product is no longer competitive. At the macro level the Government has failed to \nimplement a nation wide plan that will enable the country to optimise its impacts and \ncapitalise in its full potential. Hence, unless the Greek tourism industry and government \naddress the major structural problems and challenges for the Greek tourism product as \nsummarised in Figure 6, its future would be seriously jeopardised.  (Buhalis,2001, Kakos, \n2002; Paulopoulos, and Kouzelis, 1998; Buhalis, and Diamantis, 2000; Paulopoulos, 1999). \nThese challenges need to address a number of critical areas, such as planning, \nenvironment, management, marketing, distribution, private sector and competitiveness. \n- 11 -\nTherefore, the Greek tourism industry needs to seek new markets and production \nprocesses to adjust to new tourism demand trends. \n \nThe above points demonstrate that the Greek tourism industry lacks the strategic vision \nrequired to enable it to reach its full potential. Despite the large number of bodies that \nshare responsibility, they have failed hitherto to make a valuable intervention and \nstrengthen the competitiveness of the country. Lack of strategic direction and a \ncomprehensive Master plan, as well as lack of public-private sector collaboration have \nresulted in major deficiencies on general planning and co-ordination (Komilis, 1994; \nZacharatos, 1989).  \n \nThis is affecting the presentation of the country on-line as there is currently no \nDestination Management System or a comprehensive portal that promotes Greece. It also \naffects the diffusion of ICTs in SMTEs, as there is a lack of suitable policies that promote \ntraining for entrepreneurs and assistance in purchasing equipment and achieving global \nnetworking.  \n \n- 12 -\nFigure 6  Structural problems and challenges for Greek Tourism \nPlanning \u2022 Inadequacy of the Greek planning process  \n\u2022 Lack of incentives towards rational tourism development \n\u2022 Inadequacy of infrastructure to serve the ever-expanding demand \n\u2022 Plethora of anarchically developed and behaving SMTEs \n\u2022 Development of tourism as a single regional development option \nEnvironment \u2022 Almost unregulated environment, with nearly complete lack of control \n\u2022 Lack of environmental culture by entrepreneurs and employees \n\u2022 Deterioration of natural, social and cultural resources \n\u2022 Lack of tourism research to identify the impacts of tourism \nManagement \u2022 Gradual deterioration of tourism product and lack of re-investment in \nimprovements  \n\u2022 Lack of co-ordination at the destination and disrespect for tourists' \nneeds \n\u2022 Unsuccessful and inconsistent programmes of government \nintervention \nMarketing \u2022 Increase of tourism arrivals but decrease of tourism expenditure per \ncapita \n\u2022 Image of Greece as cheap, simple, unsophisticated, undifferentiated, \nsun-sea destination  \n\u2022 Failure to promote Greece as a differentiated tourism product \n\u2022 Inappropriate and ill-timed marketing campaign which has little \neffectiveness \n\u2022 Negligence with regard to new tourism demand challenges \n\u2022 Inability to take advantage of Customer Relationship Management \nDistribution \u2022 Dependence upon major tour operators for promotion and distribution \n\u2022 Inadequate distribution mechanisms  \n\u2022 Over-dependence on existing intermediaries \nPrivate sector \u2022 Plethora of SMTEs aiming to short term profitability \n\u2022 Oversupply of tourism amenities and fierce price competition \n\u2022 Lack of professionalism and training in both state and private tourism \nestablishments  \n\u2022 Individualistic behaviour by SMTEs and unwillingness to cooperate on \na destination basis \n\u2022 Failure of the private sector to invest in long term projects \n\u2022 Lack of training and education for SMTEs employees and \nenterpreneurs \n\u2022 Employment of unqualified staff \n\u2022 SMTEs' inability to resist in global concentration of the tourism industry\nPublic Sector \u2022 Inadequate and inappropriate political intervention  \n\u2022 Inadequately co-ordinated policies between different government \ndepartments \n\u2022 Headship of Tourism seen as a junior political post, generating \nfrequent changes \nCompetitiveness \u2022 Global concentration of the tourism industry \n\u2022 Over-dependence on traditional intermediaries and tour operators  \n\u2022 Failure of both the private and public sectors to learn from \ninternationally gained experience in tourism development and \nmarketing \n\u2022 Lack of professionalism in several levels \n \nSources: Buhalis, 2001; Briassoulis, 1993; Donatos, and Zairis, 1991; Leontidou, 1991; \nTsartas, 1992. \n- 13 -\n3. Research Methodology  \n \nTo fulfil the objectives of this research a number of methods were used. As there was no \nprevious research on eTourism in Greece, exploratory research was employed. Both \nprimary and secondary data were therefore essential. Given the dynamic nature of the \nsubject area, multiple primary research approaches were adopted, including both \nqualitative and quantitative methods (Phillip, 1998). Bryman (1998) explains that the two \nmethods are complementary rather than competing, especially for exploratory research. \nAs Henderson (1990, 181) concludes \u2018 the value of multiple methods is that they lead to \nmultiple realities\u2019. An explicit discussion of all the methods employed to gather primary \ninformation follows. \n \nInitially comprehensive secondary research was undertaken on issues related to \neCommerce, eTourism, tourism in Greece and SMEs. This identified relevant literature and \nparadigms from other regions. Given the exploratory nature of this subject area, primary \nresearch included both qualitative and quantitative methods. Following the secondary \nresearch a comprehensive research design was developed that included three research \nwaves as indicated in Figure 7.  \n \nFigure 7 Primary research stages \nStages Key Objective Method\/Instrument Expected Results  \nFirst Identification level of \neTourism presence \nComprehensive research \non GTP as well as in.gr, \nand Robby.gr \nLevel and capability of \nonline interaction \nSecond Identify critical issues \nand key factors that \ndetermine eTourism in \nGreece \nSemi-structured face to \nface interviews \nData on eCommerce and \nInternet strategies in \nTourism \nThird Increase number of \nrespondents and \nensure participants \nfrom remote regions  \nQuestionnaire via email Elicit quantitative data \nregarding eCommerce \nand Internet strategies \nFirst a qualitative approach was adopted in order to enable the appreciation of all aspects \nof the subject and to develop a set of the most critical variables to be included afterwards \ninto a questionnaire. The first stage of the primary research consisted of the identification \nof tourism organisations that have already established an on-line presence. Lederer et al \n(2000) suggest that ease of understanding and ease of finding predict ease of use and \ninformation quality predicts usefulness of revisited sites. The main objective was to \nobjectively establish the level of eCommerce and the on-line representation of Greek \ntourism. In addition, the degree of co-operation between organisations, as represented by \nthe existence of hypertext links in tourism-related sites was also examined. A survey of all \nthe tourism organisations that listed their Unique Resource Locator (URL) in the Greek \nTravel Pages (GTP) was undertaken. The GTP includes a record of all the 8000 hotels as \nwell as about 3000 travel agencies around Greece. It is considered as the most \ncomprehensive directory of Greek tourism and it is used widely by the industry. In \naddition, two Greek search engines, In.gr, and Robby.gr (http:\/\/www.in.gr,\nhttp:\/\/www.robby.gr) were selected and considered as critical Greek portals. Both of these \nportals include tourism directory listings and are well used. This process identified 348 \nweb sites representing hotels, travel agencies and other tourism enterprises. The study \nthen examined these 348 websites to assess the level of eCommerce maturity. A critical \nexamination of the web sites was undertaken by using an exploratory web survey \ninstrument that enabled the recording of the online booking capabilities. These included \nincluding email, booking forms, real-time booking capability, other channels of bookings \n- 14 -\nand no online booking. A critical review was then undertaken online to assess the level of \ninteraction offered, the links provided and their ability to transact online. The analysis of \nthe hyperlinks also provided an indication of the level of networking at the marketplace. \nThis method enabled the researchers to establish the level of Greek tourism eCommerce \nand online representation.  \n \nThe second stage involved semi-structured interviews aimed to elicit critical issues and to \nexplore the key factors that determine the development of eTourism in Greece. In-depth \ninterviews are considered as the most appropriate method to obtain information about \nperceptions, attitudes and beliefs (Frankfort-Nachmias and Nachmias, 1996; Finn, Elliot-\nWhite and Walton, 2000; Denzin and Lincoln, 1994). Judgmental sampling was employed \nand interviewees were selected as pioneers in eTourism in Greece, as determined by their \nonline presence assessed in the previous phase of the research. Owners and marketing \nmanagers of organisations that run innovative web sites, as demonstrated by the methods \nused to interact with their clientele, were targeted and an interview was requested. The \nsample was chosen to include interviewees who would be informed, reflecting their \nparticular experience and outlook on the research area. Fifty-five telephone contacts were \nmade and 28 interviews were finally conducted, which resulted in a 51% response rate as \ndemonstrated in Table 2. The interviews were conducted over a period of 3 weeks at the \nrespondents\u2019 place of work and each of the interviews differed in length, with an average \ntime of 45 minutes. \n \nA semi-structured interview and an interview schedule were designed to answer a series \nof specific questions on a face-to-face basis. The interview instrument was divided in 4 \nparts. Part 1 captured the business rationale for the Internet presence and the \neCommerce strategy that guides their development. Part 2 focused on current exploitation \nof online co-operation as well as views and beliefs about future prospects regarding DMS. \nThe aim of part 3 was to examine general trends of market demand and \npersonal\/demographic information of the respondent could be found in part 4. The semi-\nstructure nature of the interviews enabled the researcher to explore in depth specific \nareas of particular interests further. Respondents were asked for their own views and \nexperiences in order to develop a clear picture of the current situation. The respondents \nwere encouraged to speak freely about the topic and every effort was made so those \nquestions would not be misleading. Probing was conducted by picking up on a sentence \nand repeating that to the respondent in a questioning manner or using a similar \ntechnique. Notes were kept on all additional questions asked. Interviews provided \nqualitative and anecdotal data regarding eCommerce and Internet strategies in Tourism. \nThey also demonstrated the degree of co-operation between tourism organisations and \nexplained their views and beliefs on DMS. Content analysis was employed to determine \nthe presence of concepts within the interview results. Data was sorted into thematic \nframeworks summarised in tabular form and was analysed at four dimensions including \nnot discussed, discussed, discussed in detail, emphasised.(Jankowicz, 1991 and Finn et al, \n2000). \n \n- 15 -\nTable 2 Number of in-depth interviews  \nTargeted Achieved Success Rate \nHotels and other \nlodgements 15 7 46.6% \nTravel Agencies 10 4 40.0% \nMuseums 4 1 25.0% \nCruise Companies 3 2 66.6% \nAirlines 2 0 0.00% \nShip Companies 3 1 33.3% \nTourism Associations 3 3 100.0% \neTravel portals 6 4 66.6% \nCar rental firms 4 2 50.0% \nCoach company 1 1 100.0% \nTour operator 3 2 66.6% \nOnline media 1 1 100.0% \nTotal 55 28 50.9% \nFinally, the third part of the research included a quantitative survey, conducted to \ncomplement the web survey and interview findings. This phase aimed to increase the \nnumber of respondents and also to ensure that players from remote regions in Greece \nparticipated in the research. Following the competition of the semi-structured interviews, a \nstructured questionnaire was drafted and was administrated via email. The questionnaire \ncontained 22 questions divided in four parts. The questions were mostly closed-ended \nquestions with two open-ended questions included for further expression of opinion. It \nwas translated in Greek and was piloted on five Greek tourism students to ensure that the \nquestions asked were clearly worded. This was particularly critical since no interviewer \nwould be present to explain further any concepts. For the questions aiming to measure \nattitudes, opinions and beliefs a 5-point Likert scale was utilised, ranging from \u2018very \nunimportant\u2019 to \u2018very important\u2019. The GTP Greek monthly travel and tourism guide \nprovided a mailing list of totalling 750 email addresses, of which 654 were still valid. \nAbout 96 emails bounced back. After a period of six weeks, a total of 54 questionnaires \nwere completed, which produced an 8% response rate. This is a relatively low response \nrate, but acceptable given the high season for the industry. The objective of the \nquestionnaire was to elicit quantitative data regarding eCommerce and the Internet \nstrategies, the degree of cooperation and their views and beliefs on DMS. This allowed \nquantifying, relating and justifying opinions and attitudes of a greater number of people \n(Clark et al., 1998; Kumar, 1996). In addition, the questionnaire allowed the gathering of \ninformation from several regions and an assessment of issues common thought the \ncountry. Table 3 indicates the response rate for each part of the research. \n \nTable 3 Primary research summary \nInstrument Targeted Achieved Response \nrate \nResponse \nassessment \nWeb survey 348 348 - -\nIn-depth interviews 55 28 51% Good\nQuestionnaires 654 54 8% Poor\nThe analysis employed descriptive statistics and content analysis to provide a wealth  of \ninformation that can provide a comprehensive picture. The data obtained from the \nquestionnaires as well as the structured answers from the semi-structured interviews were \nimputed into SPSS. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies, means and standard \ndeviations were computed. In addition a number of cross-tabulations were run.  \n \n- 16 -\n4.  Analysis of findings \nQualitative research indicated that the generic state of eCommerce in Greece is still \nunderdeveloped. The majority of the experts agreed that worldwide, eCommerce ranks \nvery highly for the tourism industry. However, they felt strongly that uptake is \ndisappointingly slow in Greece at the moment. Participants felt strongly that although they \nwould like eCommerce to have a central role in their strategy, at that moment it was of \nneutral importance. Although they recognised that international markets predominantly \nuse Web-based travel agencies and portals at the countries of origin to make their \nbookings, they still felt that Greek tourism industry has not moved fast enough. This was \nattributed to the low Internet access and inertia towards eCommerce shown by the \noverwhelming majority of the Greek population. They argued that although the \ninternational market is very important, they are quite dependent on the domestic market \nas well. An interviewee from the hotel sector further commented that problems may arise \nif hoteliers publicise their own prices on their websites, as this may upset the international \ntour operators the collaborate with. Hence, he explained that hotels were required by \nwholesalers to publish official rack rates on their websites, making them unattractive for \ndirect bookings. Therefore, respondents felt that eCommerce was not their main priority \ncurrently. \n \n4.1 Greek Tourism Organisations: online presence \n \nTable 4 indicates the percentage of enterprises that promoted their website and email \naddress at the GTP (2002). As the vast majority of the Greek tourism enterprises are \nrepresented in the TTG this list provided a close approximation of the eTourism map of \nGreece. \n \nTable 4 Frequency of Internet representations in GTP \nTotal number of \nestablishments \nincluded in GTP \nNumber of \nestablishments \nhaving website \npresence and\/or \nemail \nHaving \nWebsite \npresence \nand\/or email \nas % of total \nAlternative Tourism \nestablishments \n15 15 100.0%\nAirlines (Only Greek \ncarriers included) \n2 2 100.0%\nConference and Meetings 6 5 84.0%\nYacht Brokers 35 22 63.0%\nHotel Chains 51 29 57.0%\nTravel Agencies 1706 868 51.0%\nRent a Car  121 50 41.0%\nMotor coach companies 111 23 21.0%\nShipping Companies 72 15 21.0%\nCruise Companies 42 5 12.0%\nHotels and other \nlodgements \n5,156 587 11.4%\nCampsites 48 2 4.2%\nMuseums, Sites and \nMonuments \n577 8 1.4%\n- 17 -\nIndependent Internet presence referred to establishments that have their own Internet \nwebsite. All of the interviewed tourism establishments and 98.1% of the questionnaire \nrespondents were found to have an independent Internet presence. This was due to the \nsampling criterion that determined which participants had to have an online presence \nbefore targeted. However, the overall picture from the 348 total websites assessed was \nthat the vast majority of the tourism organisations were at a very early stage of the \neTourism development. The web site layout was rather simple, with limited information \nand with a low quality interfaces. Email and comment forms were the most common \nforms of interactivity. However, some websites provided guest book facilities and mailing \nlists for further contact. In terms of language coverage, 90% of the websites examined \noffered their content in more than one language. The most frequent languages cited were \nGreek and English. This was considered as a positive sign of development as the number \nof available languages determines the extent to which international customers can actually \nunderstand and use the system. \n \nIn an attempt to explore the technological levels and their involvement, both interviewees \nand respondents had to state who was responsible in their organisation for their online \npresence. In most cases tourism organisations outsourced their web site development to \nspecialist companies. According to interviewees, the time pressures to launch their site \nand the lack of internal knowledge\/ expertise forced tourism enterprises to assign the \ndevelopment, hosting and management of their online presence to web design \ncompanies. Often it was these companies that have initiated the process and have sold an \neSolution to tourism enterprises. As most people do not have the technical expertise and \ntools to deploy and manage a website management they feel that outsourcing is the only \nrealistic option. In most cases there was not a clear eCommerce strategy and a web site \nwas seen mainly as an electronic brochure. \n \n4.2 eCommerce: Distribution channels, value chain and online bookings \n \nThe Internet revolutionises the tourism distribution channels, as it enables individual and \ninstitutional customers to place bookings directly. The most commonly available \nreservation features in the Greek tourism Internet arena are email provision and booking \nforms (Table 5). Real time bookings, that enable consumers to get a confirmation on the \nspot, were a rarity. It was surprising that some cases web sites only displayed telephone \nand fax numbers. Interviewees justified that at this stage their website has been \ndeveloped simply for information provision and they have found the procedure to provide \nonline booking too complex. One interviewee commented \u201cif we provide them with email \naddress, then we will have to arrange money transfers and other issues. Therefore why \nshould we spend the time to read emails and reply when we are just one phone call \naway? If we are going to do it someday, we will provide the complete booking solution.\u201d \nThis demonstrates that the potential benefits of eCommerce are not fully explored in the \nGreek tourism context. Quite frequently Greek tourism entrepreneurs think and operate \nprimarily in a fashion that serves the domestic market, whilst ignoring the international \nmarkets and their modern expectations.  \n \neCommerce is in its infancy as the majority of respondents and interviewees stated that \nInternet bookings represent between 1% and 5% of their total reservations. Lack of \nknowledge as to how to manage and market their website was identified as a limitation. \nThe possibilities highlighted in the literature for online promotions (O\u2019Connor, 1999; \nBuhalis, 2003), such as discounts to encourage Internet bookings, upgrades and other \nmethods used, were neither mentioned by interviewees nor observed in the web survey. \nMoreover, a significant difference was found between small and larger companies, with \nthe latter achieving higher numbers of online bookings. This was attributable to the better \n- 18 -\nfinancial resources available, the gradual appreciation of eCommerce potential and the \nability to employ the technical expertise in order to promote online bookings.  \n \nTable 5.

Therefore, they carry on \ncommunicating through traditional channels such as the telephone to obtain even the \nmost insignificant information that could easily be found on their website. This proves that \nthe existing business culture and style are based on interpersonal relationships and the \nGreek industry provides evidence of reluctance to change.  \n \n4.3 Online Co-operation and developing entrepreneurial networks \n \nCooperation as much as competition is a feature of the emerging online tourism services \nsector. Internet-enabled co-operation is propelling entrepreneurial networks have been \ndefined as networks of economic \u201cactors\u201d and activities aimed at creating new resources \nor combining existing resources in new ways to develop new products and service new \ncustomers (Hitt, Ireland, Camp, and Sexton, 2001). In the tourism industry, intra-industry \nhorizontal networks can be developed among clusters of firms that are more alike than \nothers, i.e. similarity of products and services or with complementary services, as for \nexample between hotels and sightseeing or transportation companies (Gulati, Nohria, & \nZaheer, 2000). Commercial suppliers will therefore increasingly provide access to each \nother\u2019s resources in order to enhance their value chain. The existence of hypertext links \namong travel related web sites is considered to be an obvious sign of co-operation and as \nan attempt by one organisation to link with others. Interviewees suggest that they do not \ntrust that the Greek National Tourism Organisation or public sector institutions. However, \nthey claimed that entrepreneurial networks emerge as an alternative that can assist \ntourism organisations to develop comprehensive value chains at their local level. This is \n- 19 -\nsimilar to many other countries, where the public sector has failed to lead the eTourism \ndevelopments, as for example in Italy (Buhalis and Molinaroli, 2003). \n \nOut of a total of 348 Greek tourism related websites examined, less than half (45.6%) \noffered any hypertext link. In the web survey, several types of links were identified. \nFirstly, type A, the lesser frequent link (5% of all offering links) observed between sites of \nsimilar players or even competitors (e.g. a hotel offering link to another hotel). \nNevertheless, in all such observations the linked competing establishment were situated in \ndifferent areas of Greece demonstrating a geographic expansion of the value chain. \nSecondly, type B links connect organisations to other complementary tourism service \nproviders (e.g. hotel to travel agency, taxis, and transfer companies). This type enjoyed \nhigher levels of occurrence, as 28% of all websites offered complementary services links. \nThirdly, 52% of the sites provided type C links, enabling access to other related service \nproviders, such as currency converter, weather, travel books\/guides and embassies. This \nindicates that the majority of businesses which have an online presence have realised the \nbenefits to be gained by offering value-added services to their customers. Finally, 10% of \nthe sites provided type D links, supporting access to less obviously related services such \nas media, journals and real estate agencies. Few links (about 2%) were provided to totally \nunrelated services, including butchers, motor garages and a car manufacturing company!  \n \nThe analysis of the links did not demonstrate the development of an organised and \nrational network among tourism establishments. The diversity of the links observed \nindicates that close personal relationships might be a leading driving force in some cases \nrather than business sense and customer service. Hence the low percentages of hypertext \nlinks illustrate low levels of co-operation online as well as little effort to develop electronic \nnetworking. \n \n4.4 Drivers towards eCommerce \n \nA number of prime drivers towards eCommerce were identified through the interviews \n(Table 6) and questionnaires (Table 7). The findings clearly demonstrate that customer \nservice, direct communication with customers, market demand and modernisation are key \nfactors, illustrating that eTourism in Greece is demand\/consumer driven. These results are \nin accordance with the existing literature (Ankar and Walden, 2001; Buhalis and Main \n1998). \n \nTable 6 Content analysis grid- Main drivers towards eCommerce \n Not discussed Discussed Discussed in detail Emphasised \nN % N % N % N %\nDirect communication\/access to \nconsumers 5 18 2 7 0 0 21 75\nReduce their dependence on \nIntermediaries 9 32 0 0 1 4 18 64\nMore efficient and accurate \ncustomer service 0 0 0 0 10 36 18 64\nMarket demand 10 36 2 7 2 7 14 50\nModernisation 18 64 2 7 2 7 6 22\nCost reduction with partners and \nother suppliers 0 0 8 28 15 54 5 18\nFear of innovative competitors 25 89 3 11 0 0 0 0\n- 20 -\nTable 7 Qualitative research results on Main drivers to eCommerce (n=54) \n 1- \nVery \nUnimpor\ntant \n2-\nUnimpor\ntant  \n3-\nNeutral  \n4-\nImport\nant \n5-\nVery \nimport\nant \nvalid \nreplies \nMean STD \nMore efficient and \naccurate customer \nservice \n2\n3.7%\n0\n0%\n4\n7.4%\n14\n25.9%\n34\n63%\n54 4.48 0.79\nDirect \ncommunication\/acc\ness to consumers \n2\n3.7%\n2\n3.7%\n3\n5.6%\n12\n22.2%\n35\n64.8%\n54 4.41 1.01\nModernisation 2\n3.8%\n0\n0%\n4\n7.5%\n17\n32.1%\n30\n56.6%\n53 4.38 0.92\nMarket demand 0\n0%\n2\n3.7%\n3\n5.6%\n24\n44.4%\n25\n46.3%\n54 4.33 0.75\nCost reduction \nwith partners and \nother suppliers \n2\n3.8%\n5\n9.4%\n13\n24%\n14\n26%\n19\n35.8%\n53 3.81 1.14\nReduce their \ndependence on \nIntermediaries \n4\n7.7%\n3\n5.8%\n15\n28%\n13\n25%\n17\n32%\n52 3.69 1.21\nFear of innovative \ncompetitors \n6\n11%\n7\n13%\n14\n26%\n13\n24%\n13\n24%\n53 3.38 1.30\nThe lowest ranked business driver was \u2018fear from competitors\u2019. This demonstrates that the \nlow level of ICT and Internet usage by the tourism industry compared to other countries is \nnot a concern for businesses that are already advanced in ICT.  Therefore, competition is \nnot yet perceived as a threat. This might have important implications however to the \nadvancement of eTourism in Greece, as competition encourages innovation and its \nabsence might prove to be a serious drawback. In addition Greek tourism enterprises \nunderestimate the global competition emerging from the Internet.  \n \n4.5 Advantages and challenges of eCommerce for Greek Tourism Enterprises \n \nThe vast majority of the eCommerce advantages quoted were customer related. This was \nconsistent with the issues raised when the main drivers towards eCommerce were \nexamined. Naturally, therefore, most respondents and interviewees (Tables 8 and 9 \nrespectively) rated communication and interaction with customers as the most significant \nadvantages. Respondents also felt strongly that the Internet revolution increases \ncompetitiveness within the sector.  \n \nResults also reflected that some Greek tourism businesses (at least the majority of those \nsurveyed) have realised the potential of eCommerce to their businesses. They gave a \nnumber of explanations as to how their businesses have benefited. One interviewee from \nthe cruise sector stated that eCommerce gradually reduces marketing, interaction and \ntransaction costs, which normally represent a significant portion of the overall costs for \ntheir operations. A hotel manager claimed that eCommerce has reinforced the their \nnatural competitive advantages of speed and flexibility. However, several respondents and \ninterviewees rated the advantage of \u2018better intra-organisational communication\u2019 as the \nleast important overall. This is attributable to the small number of employees within \ncompanies surveyed, as is in some cases there were only two or three which result in low \nneed for internal communications. \n- 21 -\nTable 8  Content analysis grid -Advantages of eCommerce (n=28) \n Not discussed \nDiscussed \n \nDiscussed in \ndetail \nEmphasised \n \nN % N % N % N %\nBetter communication with \ncustomers 0 0 1 3.5 7 25 20 71.5\nCost Reduction 1 3.5 5 18 3 10.5 11 39.5\nBetter communication with \nsuppliers\/partners 1 3.5 3 10.5 16 57.5 8 28.5\nEnhanced competitiveness 6 21.5 6 21.5 10 36 6 21.5\nBetter communication with \nsuppliers\/partners 5 18 8 28.5 9 32 6 21.5\nBetter intra-organisational \ncommunication 15 53.5 10 36 3 10.5 0 0\nTable 9  Questionnaire results on eCommerce perceived advantages  \n 1-Very \nunimporta\nnt \n2-\nUnimpor\ntant \n3- \nNeutral \n4- \nImporta\nnt \n5-  \nVery \nimporta\nnt \nN Mean Std \nDev \nBetter \ncommunication \nwith customers \n1\n1.9%\n0\n0%\n4\n7.4%\n11\n20.4%\n38\n70.4%\n54 4.57 0.79\nEnhanced \ncompetitiveness \n2\n3.7%\n2\n3.7%\n6\n11.1%\n18\n33.3%\n26\n48.1\n54 4.19 1.02\nCost Reduction 1\n1.9%\n2\n3.8%\n10\n18.9%\n22\n41.5%\n18\n34%\n53 4.02 0.93\nBetter \ncommunication \nwith \nsuppliers\/partners \n2\n3.8%\n2\n3.8%\n8\n15.4%\n25\n48.1%\n15\n28.8%\n52 3.94 0.97\nBetter intra-\norganisational \ncommunication \n9\n17.6%\n6\n11.8%\n16\n31.4%\n13\n25.5%\n7\n13.7%\n51 3.06 1.28\nAlthough it was only the qualitative part of the research that addressed the issues of \nproblems faced by businesses in relation to their online presence and eCommerce, the \ninferences were valuable and most of the answers were in accordance with the \ncorresponding literature. The majority of interviewees emphasised that lack of financial \nresources and low-use of the Internet and eCommerce by the domestic market were their \nmajor problems. Many stressed the need for government financial aid (Table 10). In \naddition, interviewees suggested that the current state of Internet bookings is inadequate \nto justify a major investment in hardware. Other hardware and netware is also considered \nuneconomical and respondents were considering the Return On their Investment. In a \nrespondent\u2019s words, \u2018telephone extensions and numerous telephone lines in order to \nconnect the different departments (e.g. restaurant with accounting), or the hotels with \ntheir suppliers to place orders electronically are perceived very expensive at present\u2019.  \n- 22 -\nTable 10  Content analysis grid- Main problems with online presence (n=28) \n Not discussed Discussed  \nDiscussed in \ndetail \n \nEmphasized \n \nN % N % N % N %\nNot sufficient \nfinancial resources 1 3.5 2 7 8 28.5 17 61\nNot used by the \ndomestic market 1 3.5 3 10.5 8 28.5 16 57.5\nLack of IT \nexpertise 10 36 3 11 9 32 6 21\nNot easy to update 9 32 15 54 2 7 2 7\nDifficult to \npersuade partners \nto use Internet 20 71.5 6 21.5 2 7 0 0\nIn general the government help to go online was perceived as inadequate. Although \ngovernment initiatives for businesses to go online do exist, entrepreneurs found the \nprocess quite difficult. Moreover, entrepreneurs perceive the process of applying to \nparticipate in those initiatives as time-consuming, due to bureaucratic procedures.  \n \nAdditionally, financial problems were mentioned by Internet-based businesses as well. \nAlthough they have already made the necessary investments and developed complete \neCommerce systems they have failed to raise adequate returns due to the low domestic \npenetration. They often face cash-flow difficulties and raise concern about their future. \nOne respondent suggested \u201cwe are not eligible to obtain government aid due to our \nadvanced technological stage; therefore, we have two options if things don\u2019t change. \nEither we will get bankrupt or we will be taken-over by a larger international player. We \nhave no other option\u2019. It is quite apparent therefore that most of Internet-based \nbusinesses have failed to penetrate in the main international markets and still rely on the \nlimited domestic market which will require years before it matures. \n \n4.6 Coordinating the destination online: The possibility for a Destination \nManagement System  \n \nThe overwhelming majority of respondents stressed their discomfort with the online \nrepresentation of Greek tourism by the Greek National Tourism Organisation (GNTO). The \nGNTO representation on the Web was assessed as totally inadequate. Only one of the \ninterviewees stated that his company website had a link with the GNTO website. Co-\noperation with the GNTO was often perceived unnecessary, as respondents claimed that \nthere was nothing to benefit from such co-operation. However, the vast majority agreed \nthat the situation calls for rapid action, in order for Greece to develop suitable electronic \ntools and remain competitive.  \n \nBoth interviewees and respondents were invited to answer questions about future \nprospects of a Destination Management System (DMS) in Greece. As there is no DMS \noperating currently in Greece, interviewees were first questioned about their knowledge \non the subject. Only 14% had heard or read about DMSs indicating that Greek tourism \nplayers were not aware of emerging trends and electronic tools. The lack of knowledge on \nsuch well-researched and so frequently mentioned tool implies the essential need to raise \nlevels of information disseminated to the Greek tourism industry. The research instrument \n- 23 -\nincluded a detailed definition of DMSs, with the intention that respondents would be in a \nposition to state their views on potential DMS developments in Greece.  \n \nThe vast majority (80%) had a positive attitude towards the development of a DMS for \nGreece and agreed that such as system is required. The respondents were invited to \njustify their selection, yet only 52% provided a specific justification. The main reasons \nargued for and against DMS development in Greece are presented in Table 11.  \n \nTable 11  Positive and negative arguments for DMS development in Greece  \nPositive Frequency (%) Negative \nFrequen\ncy (%) \nImprove competitiveness \nthrough co-operation 75 Lack of co-operation 78 \nImprove destination \nimage and promotion 60 \nPublic sector unable to serve \ncustomers efficiently 60 \nMore efficient and \naccurate communication 47 \nQuestionable success in the \nGreek context- Politics and \nconflicts \n58 \nImproved professionalism \nof tourism sector 30 Against public sector involvement 55 \nImprove SMEs visibility 14 Fear of disintermediation  33 \nNote: (n=82, valid n=41) \n \nThe positive justifications were all in accordance with the international literature of DMSs \nadvantages. They included more improved and accurate communication at the destination \nlevel, with all the benefit that could bring to the individual small businesses. One of the \nrespondents mentioned that DMSs have already provide opportunities for other regions \nthat Greeks have failed to take due to the \u2018disorganised and self-determination culture\u2019 of \nthe population. He commented that Greece would be a much wealthier and more \nadvanced country in all sectors if the culture was different.  \n \nThe vast majority of the respondents were positive towards DMSs and acknowledged the \npossibility of better representation of the Greek Tourism indystry internationally. However, \nsome respondents expressed concern about the prospect of these systems to contribute \nto Greek Tourism. They attributed their opposition to the politics that surrounds tourism \nissues as well as the lack of cooperation between the national and regional tourism \norganisations. They also expressed concern that the potential conflicts between various \nactors will be detrimental for the success of the system. These issues clearly show the \nfragmented Greek tourism stakeholders interests and that much closer collaboration is \nrequired before these systems can be successfully implemented. Although the majority of \nparticipants agreed that co-operation is quite important for the competitive position of \nGreek tourism, they once again raised doubts about the real possibility for achieving such \nco-operation. \n \nHowever, many interviewees expected that a higher degree of co-operation will be \nachieved in the future between private and public sector tourism organisations. In \naddition, they expressed confidence that the new generation of tourism managers will be \nbetter educated and a higher degree of professionalism is observed in the marketplace. \n \n- 24 -\n5. Discussion and lessons for other regions  \n \nIt is evident that ICTs and DMSs will be playing a more critical role in the operational and \nstrategic management of tourism internationally. A number of Internet-mature countries \naround the world have already experienced the establishment of eTourism as a mainstream \ndistribution and marketing mechanism in the marketplace. Organisations employ eTourism \ntools for communicating with all their stakeholders, as well as for improving their internal \nprocesses. However, a number of fairly developed countries have still to adopt suitable \ntechnological tools and are going through their Internet infancy. These are late-adopters of \ninnovation. Although they have failed to benefit from the early adoption of technology and \nthe know-how that has been generated, they can still learn from the mistakes of others and \n\u201cleapfrog\u201d to more advanced technologies.  \n \n5.1  Discussion and lessons for tourism enterprises and SMEs in other regions \n \nAt the private sector\/individual business level, this study demonstrates that a number of \ninnovative tourism organisations in Greece employ eTourism and Internet tools, mainly to \nenhance their communications with their clientele and stakeholders. It seems that are fairly \nreluctant to adopt these technologies, but they accept that the market is moving towards \nthat direction. Due to the sampling technique used in this research most respondents are \nearly-adopters and between the third and fourth step of their eAdoption ladder. However, \nthe vast majority of the private sector\/individual tourism businesses in Greece belong to the \nLaggard or Late Majority adoption stages. Only few innovative players are on the early \nadoption stage and a number of forces and barriers for change have been identified. \nGreek tourism as a whole, therefore, is a late adopter and ideally should learn from \nmistakes by other regions in order to advance faster. Failure to do so will have major \nimplications for its collective competitiveness. Greece as a Mediterranean region already \nexperiences fierce competition and it can only intensify once more destinations and \nenterprises use ICTs for their management and the Internet for their promotion. \n \nThis situation is common with a number of other regions around the world, where although \nan Internet adoption rate of between 15-30% is observed, the majority of the SMTEs have \nso far failed to take full advantage of the emerging technologies. Only very few players \nwere found in Greece to be at the fifth or sixth steps of their eAdoption Ladder and almost \nnone has reached the seventh step. Similar results can be observed in \u201csecond Internet \nwave\u201d countries such as Italy, Spain and even New Zealand (Buhalis and Molinaroli, 2003; \nSancho-Perez and Maset-Llaudes, 2002, Nodder et al, 2003.). This is in contrast with a \nnumber of organisations in the developed world, and in particular in the USA, the UK and \nScandinavian countries, where a number of tourism organisations either emerged to take \nadvantage of the Internet (e.g. Expedia, Travelocity, Lastminute.com) or transformed their \norganisations dramatically to take advantage of the emerging technologies (e.g. \nScandinavian Airlines, eBookers.com, Marriott). The private sector therefore in \u201csecond \nInternet wave\u201d countries, and SMTEs in particular, need to expand their eCommerce \nknowledge and to progress through the different steps of their eAdoption Ladder in order to \nenhance their competitiveness and address the challenges of the future.  \n \n- 25 -\n5.1  Discussion and lessons for Destination Management Organisations in other \nregions \n \nAt the destination level\/public sector, Greece has failed to identify the need for eTourism \ntools that will enable the country to develop a comprehensive representation online. It is \ntherefore a laggard and has not yet reached the second step of the eAdoption ladder. The \nGNTO not only has failed to develop an eBusiness strategy, but it has not even attempted to \nautomate its internal processes and administration. This can also be observed in a number \nof regions around the world where DMSs have not been developed or employed yet (WTO, \n2001b). Destination Management Organisations (DMOs) need to re-engineer their role as \nplanners, co-ordinators, regulators and promoters of destinations. They need to identify \nthe wider range of technologies that can support their operational and strategic \nmanagement and develop or acquire suitable solutions. DMOs need to be catalysts for the \ndevelopment and promotion of tourism at any destination and for fostering co-operation \namongst the entire body of stakeholders. However, DMOs have traditionally been slow in \nrecognising the change of their role, their new challenges and in adopting suitable \ntechnologies. Only few exceptions can be observed globally, namely Austria, Ireland, \nAustralia and Singapore. DMOs therefore demand reliable and accurate systems, which \ncan provide user-friendly interfaces for communications with consumers, suppliers and the \ntravel trade. They also require systems that will assist them to rationalise their internal \nprocesses and procedures. Greater emphasis should be placed on the importance of \nprivate-public sectors partnerships for the successful development and implementation of \nDMSs (Buhalis and Spada, 2000). Successful DMSs of the future will probably need to \ndemonstrate a number of characteristics as illustrated in Figure 8. \n \nFigure 8: Successful Destination Management Systems of the future \n \n\u2022 Vision, commitment and strategic understanding at the top \n\u2022 Complete and comprehensive representation of the entire range of tourism \nenterprises and facilities  \n\u2022 Accurate information, tourism product pricing and unbiased inventory display  \n\u2022 Guaranteed acceptance of confirmed bookings  \n\u2022 Strong political and industrial support  \n\u2022 Secure and adequate financial bases, based on a realistic business model \n\u2022 Interconnectivity and interoperability of systems  \n\u2022 Multi-channel strategies capitalising on all technologies and  \n\u2022 Strong links with all distribution partners and mechanisms \n\u2022 Technology must always follow business models, not lead them \n\u2022 Wide number of added value services, based on personalised information \n\u2022 Micro-sites for niche markets and specialised groups  \n\u2022 Convenient payment methods for consumers, guaranteed commission payment for \nall intermediaries involved in a booking and prompt suppliers settlement  \n\u2022 Easy, clear and accessible interfaces \n\u2022 A degree of standardisation between DMSs  \n\u2022 Marketing of DMS to both consumers and travel trade on line and offline  \n\u2022 SMTEs should be involved at an early stage and gain ownership \n \nFor those DMOs that have yet to deploy a DMS, there are several emerging options that \ncan enable them to develop their online presence effectively. Firstly, they can purchase a \nsystem from a small number of reliable suppliers that have emerged in the marketplace. \nSome suppliers have gained significant expertise through the implementation of similar \nsystems around the world. Secondly, DMOs can adopt a DMS on a Application Service \nProvider (ASP) basis from vendors, such as Tiscover.com. They can effectively pay rent for \n- 26 -\nthe usage of the system and benefit from the constant technological updates and the \nadditional services offered by the ASP vendors. Finally, DMOs can develop a \ncomprehensive destination marketplace, where they can provide objective information on \nthe destination, but encourage existing eCommerce operators to promote and trade their \nproducts. Interoperability with a sufficient number of operators will ensure that there is a \ncomprehensive offering in the marketplace. Although this model may be less than an ideal \nsolution, it can be cost effective, whilst reinforcing the partnership between private and \npublic sectors. \n \n6. Conclusion  \n \nThe ICT penetration and the level of eCommerce in both the supply and demand sides in \nGreece are in their embryonic stages. The results from this study indicate that the tourism \nbusiness sector is lagging behind the opportunities with the rapidly changing environment. \nThe lack of strategic business planning and the limited levels of understanding of the \neTourism potential imply that the Greek tourism sector needs to rethink its position in \norder to compete at an international level with other destinations. This conclusion is \nfurther reinforced by the fact that the sample was made-up of users already on the \nInternet and yet their technological advancement is limited. The need for change is \nobvious when one considers that Greece\u2019s main international tourism markets (British and \nGermans) are among the top European Internet users. One of the most important \ninhibitors for the advancement of eCommerce revealed to be the Greek populations\u2019 \ninertia towards online transactions. Additional reasons include the personal nature of \nbusiness to customer relationships, the lack of formal information and the low usage of \nthe Internet by the Greek population. Greece\u2019s challenge during the next decade is to \ncapitalise on new technology developments and to use emerging eTourism tools in order \nto better promote and market the tourist product. The situation is similar in a number of \n\u201csecond Internet wave\u201d countries which are gradually reaching their Internet maturity. \n \nAlthough the Internet represents important opportunities for independent suppliers, and \nparticularly for small and medium-sized enterprises to co-operate, they are once more \nfinding it increasingly difficult to cope with the increasingly complex and challenging \nenvironment. Collaborative networking should be established, through exchanging \nlinkages with other complimentary suppliers and travel related websites. The views of the \nGreek tourism industry towards DMS were positive at a general level. However, the \nmajority of respondents raised serious concerns about the ability of the GNTO to introduce \nand operate a successful DMS in Greece. Networking and co-operation between tourism \norganisations were highlighted as significant challenges for the success of DMS. The \ndevelopment of a DMS can only flourish in the Greek tourism context if trust between \ntourism stakeholders is built. Unless the public and private sector capitalise on the \nemerging eTourism tools, the Greek tourism will face major competitive disadvantage in \nthe future. Similar conclusions can be drawn for many destinations around the world. \nHence destinations around the world will need to develop a long-term eTourism strategy \nand to co-ordinate both their public and private sectors.  \n \n- 27 -\n6.
