Several evolutionary theories have been\npostulated to explain this phenomenon, but the underlying\nbiological regulators of longevity remained largely unknown until\npioneering genetic studies using the roundworm Caenorhabditis\nelegans identified the first gene with a substantial role in\ndetermining lifespan [1,2,3].\nGiven that post-reproductive survival cannot evolve under\ndirect selection, diapause (the entry into a semi-dormant state with\nlow metabolic turnover) is generally perceived as being a by-\nproduct of a survival strategy triggered by the organism to outlive\nharsh conditions so that, upon encountering a suitable environ-\nment, reproduction can be resumed [4]. One such strategy\nemployed by the Caenorhabditis nematodes is to enter into a\ntemporary, developmentally arrested dauer stage. [5,6,7]. In C.\nelegans, this phenomenon is regulated by the IIS (Insulin\/Insulin\u2013\nlike growth factor (IGF) signalling) pathway, which consists of a\ntransmembrane protein DAF-2 [8], several intracellular kinases\nand the DAF-16 transcription factor [9]. When inactivated, this\npathway not only extends lifespan but also regulates resistance to\npathogens and abiotic stresses [10,11,12]. Mutations in this\npathway, such as inhibitory mutations in age-1 (a homologue of\nthe mammalian phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase) or daf-2 (a\nhomologue of the mammalian insulin receptor) result in the\nrelocalization of the transcription factor DAF-16 into the nucleus\nwhere it regulates a plethora of downstream genes [2,13,14,15,16].\nThe IIS pathway is highly conserved in organisms ranging from\nyeast to humans and, in many cases, appears to retain its dual role\nas a major effector of immunity and longevity [17,18,19,20].\nStudies in C. elegans have explored this coupling relationship\nbetween the daf-16 determined phenotypes of longevity, immunity\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 4 | e9978\nand stress tolerance to a great extent, but little is known about the\ncorresponding phenotypes in other nematode species.\nHere we provide experimental data to address this question by\nundertaking a comprehensive analysis of immunity, stress response\nand longevity phenotypes in several representative isolates of four\nnematode species within the same genus. We demonstrate that,\nwithin this group of closely related animals, there exists a high\ndivergence with regards to traits such as lifespan and stress\ntolerance and, intriguingly, in the expression of daf-16. Further-\nmore, we investigated conservation in the DAF-16 downstream\nregulon (target genes) by surveying the three available Caenorhabdi-\ntis genomes (C. elegans, C. briggsae and C. remanei) for genes\ncontaining the known consensus sites for DAF-16. Based on\northologous sets of genes containing the consensus sites, we asked\nwhether certain biological processes are more prevalent in one\nspecies than in others (divergent targets) and which processes are\nshared between all three species. We also tested for adaptive\nsequence evolution along the IIS pathway in these species. Finally,\nwe use classical genetics to constitutively activate the DAF-16\npathway in two Caenorhabditis species in order to experimentally\nidentify both conserved and divergent downstream phenotypes.\nResults\nGonochoristic species are longer lived than the\nhermaphroditic species and show higher levels of daf-16\nexpression\nWe and others have previously demonstrated that different\nCaenorhabditis species exhibit significantly different lifespans\n[21,22]. Since different laboratory isolates can exhibit variation\nin lifespan [23], we conducted parallel longevity assays on our\nisolates of C. elegans N2, C. briggsae AF16, C. remanei EM464 and C.\nbrenneri CB5161. As previously reported [22], the two gonochor-\nistic species (C. remanei and C. brenneri) exhibit a significantly\n(p,0.0001; see Table S1 for all p-values) longer lifespan than both\nhermaphroditic species (C. elegans and C. briggsae) (Figure 1a).\nAdditional testing confirmed that this trend was highly conserved\nacross multiple wildtype isolates of each species (Figure 1b, Table\nS2), as previously reported [22]. The testing of several hermaph-\nroditic wildtype isolates also ruled out the possibility that these\nobservations were due to the fixation of novel mutations under the\nforce of genetic drift in our laboratory C.elegans (N2) line.\nGiven the evolutionary conservation and critical role played by\nDAF-16 in regulating lifespan in C. elegans, we quantified daf-16\nmRNA levels in both mixed populations (nematodes at various\nstages of development) and staged populations (L2-L3, L4 and\nadult stages) of all strains of the four Caenorhabditis species. Whilst\nC. briggsae showed daf-16 levels similar to those in C. elegans, daf-16\nexpression in the two gonochoristic species was between seven (C.\nbrenneri) and twelve (C. remanei) fold higher than C. elegans in the\nmixed populations (Figure 2a). Higher daf-16 expression levels\namong the gonochoristic species was also observed throughout\ndevelopment in the staged populations (Figure 2bi, 2bii & 2biii)\nwith the difference being most prominent in the L4 stage\n(Figure 2bii). Thus higher levels of daf-16 expression seem to\npositively correlate with longer lifespan.\nWe also tested for expression levels of daf-16 in C.elegans males\nusing two independent reference genes (Table S3) and found no\nsignificant transcriptional difference in comparison to C. elegans\nhermaphrodites, indicating that the absence or presence of males\nin a population has no effect with regards to daf-16 expression\nlevels. We note that the presence of both males and females within\nthe gonochoristic population could mean that enhanced daf-16\nexpression may be restricted to one or other gender, but given that\nboth male and female animals in the gonochoristic species are\nlonger lived than either gender of C. elegans or C. briggsae [21], we\nregard it as more likely that daf-16 is highly expressed in both\ngenders of the gonochoristic species.\nLong-lived species are more resistant to abiotic stress\nthan shorter-lived species\nIn C. elegans, DAF-16 activity substantially increases survival\nfollowing exposure to high temperature or heavy metals [10,24].\nTo test whether the observed higher levels of daf-16 in the\ngonochoristic species also correlate with better survival to abiotic\nstress, we exposed multiple isolates of all four species to prolonged\nhigh temperature of 37uC (Figure 3a) or toxic heavy metals such as\nCuCl2 (Figure 3b, Figure S2). In both cases, the gonochoristic\nspecies showed significantly (Table S1) higher survival than either\nhermaphroditic species. The correlation of these phenotypes with\ndaf-16 expression levels, together with prior knowledge from\nstudies in C. elegans, suggests that higher DAF-16 levels could\npotentially be driving both increased lifespan and increased\nresistance to abiotic stress.\nLonger-lived species in general are more resistant to\nbiotic stress factors than the shorter-lived species\nNumerous human pathogens are now known to be lethal\ntowards C. elegans [25,26,27,28,29,30,31]. Since DAF-16 activity\ncontributes towards stress resistance during infection [32], we\nassessed whether the four Caenorhabditis species varied in resistance\nto a range of pathogens. Interestingly, type strains of the two long-\nlived, gonochoristic species (EM464 and CB5161) showed\nsignificantly higher resistance to the Gram-negative bacterium\nPseudomonas aeruginosa (Figure 4a), the Gram-positive bacterium\nStaphylococcus aureus (Figure 4b) and the fungus Cryptococcus neofor-\nmans [21] than type strains of the two hermaphroditic species\n(AF16 and N2). However, all four species showed similar\nsensitivity to the Gram-negative pathogen Salmonella typhimurium\n(Figure 4c). To ensure that these differences were not isolate\ndependent, we tested multiple additional isolates of each species\nfor resistance to S. aureus. In all cases, gonochoristic isolates exhibit\nsubstantially higher resistance to killing by this pathogen (Table S2\nand Figure S1), suggesting that the higher DAF-16 levels in the\ntwo gonochoristic species may potentially drive enhanced\nresistance to some, but not all, pathogens.\nSince progeny production and the consequent risk of matricidal\nkilling has previously been shown to shorten C. elegans lifespan,\nparticularly when exposed to pathogens, [30,33,34] we considered\nthe possibility that the enhanced survival of gonochoristic species\nmay result from the absence of matricidal killing. To test this, we\nexposed feminised (and thus infertile when singled) C. elegans\nanimals (BA17, fem-1(hc17)) to the pathogenic bacteria S. aureus.\nAs previously reported, feminised C. elegans exhibited improved\nsurvival under pathogenic conditions (Figure S3), but this increase\nis nowhere as significant as the increase in lifespan seen in the\nhigher daf-16 producing gonochoristic species on S. aureus. Thus\nthe enhanced survival of gonochoristic species is not attributable to\nthe lack of progeny production.\nManipulation of the DAF-16 pathway\nC. elegans DAF-16 activity can be dramatically enhanced by loss-\nof-function mutations in the upstream insulin-like growth factor\nreceptor DAF-2 [35,36]. We investigated whether this phenomenon\nis conserved in C. briggsae, which, like C. elegans, has low basal levels of\nDAF-16 (Figure 2a), by comparing daf-2 loss-of-function mutants in\nboth species. As previously reported [7] we observed that C. briggsae\nPhenotypic Covariance\/Coupling\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 4 | e9978\n(daf-2) mutants, have increased longevity relative to wildtype\nanimals (Figure 5a). In addition, inactivation of daf-2 in C. briggsae\nenhances resistance to high temperature (Figure 5b) and heavy\nmetal toxicity (Figure 5c), as it does in C. elegans [10,37].\nInterestingly, C. briggsae daf-2 mutants show enhanced resistance\ntowards S. aureus (p,0.02, Table S4) and P. aeruginosa (p,0.0001,\nTable S4), but the magnitude of the increase is substantially smaller\nthan that for C. elegans daf-2mutants (Figures 5d and 5e). Finally, loss\nof daf-2 did not enhance resistance to S. typhimurium in either C.\nelegans or C. briggsae (Figure 5f). Regrettably, genetic mutants in daf-2\nor daf-16 are not available for either gonochoristic species, nor is\nRNA interference efficient enough in these species to allow direct\nmanipulation of the IIS pathway in a similar manner. However,\nshould such studies become feasible in the future, then our data\nwould predict that loss of daf-2 would likely have only a minimal\neffect on lifespan and stress resistance in the gonochoristic species.\nFigure 1. Lifespan analysis. (a) Hermaphrodite (N2, AF16) or female (EM464, CB5161) animals at the fourth larval stage (L4) were transferred onto\nplates pre-seeded with OP50 and monitored for survival over fifty days. Whilst hermaphrodite animals show 100% lethality over this period, survival is\nsignificantly higher for both gonochoristic species (p,0.0001, Table S1), with more than 50% of animals surviving longer than twenty days. (b) This\neffect is conserved across multiple wildtype isolates of each species.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0009978.g001\nPhenotypic Covariance\/Coupling\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 April 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 4 | e9978\nComparative analysis of the DAF-16 regulon in C. elegans,\nC. briggsae and C. remanei\nWe considered the possibility that the DAF-16 pathway itself\nmay have become modified during the diversification of the\nCaenorhabditid nematodes. However, calculation of Ka\/Ks ratios\nfor all of the components in the IIS signalling pathway (daf-2, age-1,\npdk-1, akt-1, and daf-16) between C. elegans, C. briggsae and C. remanei\nshowed no evidence for positive selection in any of the genes\n(Table S5).\nGiven that the IIS pathway itself does not appear to have been\nmodified during the evolution of these species, we next\ninvestigated whether the downstream targets of DAF-16 differed\nbetween the three sequenced nematode species (C. elegans, C.\nbriggsae and C. remanei). We searched for the presence of perfectly\nmatched DAF-16 canonical consensus sites (ttatttac\/gtaaataa,\nttgtttac\/gtaaacaa) in the 3kb upstream of every predicted gene in\nC. elegans, C. briggsae and C. remanei. In C. elegans our approach\nyielded 6293 genes (31.2% of the genome) containing either one or\nboth of the known sites in their 3kb upstream region. In\ncomparison, only 23.4% (5,150 genes) in C. briggsae and 26.7%\n(8,456 genes) in C. remanei contained at least one of the consensus\nsites. We note that the short length and relative variability of the\nDAF-16 consensus sequence means that this approach inherently\noverestimates the number of DAF-16 binding sites in the genome.\nHowever, given the absence of experimental techniques (such as\nchromatin immunoprecipitation) in the non-elegans species, such a\nbioinformatic approach is, at present, the only way of obtaining an\napproximate estimate of genome-wide differences in the IIS\npathway within this group of organisms.\nBased on this analysis, the number of orthologous genes that\ncontain perfect matches to the DAF-16 consensus binding sites\nappears similar between C. elegans and C. briggsae (1900 genes), C.\nelegans and C. remanei (2111 genes) and C. briggsae and C. remanei\n(2165 genes). However, although C. elegans, C. briggsae and C.\nremanei have 13,015 genes in common (64.4% of the C. elegans\ngenome) only 913 of these contain the DAF-16 binding elements\nin all three species, a group that we define as the core DAF-16\nregulon (Figure S4).\nBased on these gene sets, we asked whether the core DAF-16\nregulon and the species-specific DAF-16 regulons differ in the type\nof genes they contain by testing whether particular gene ontology\n(GO) terms (using GOTERM BP_ALL and GOTERM BP_2) are\noverrepresented (Table S6 and Table S7). The DAF-16 core\nregulon shows, amongst others, enrichment for genes that are\ninvolved in lifespan regulation, immune response and responses to\nchemical stimuli (including detoxification and stress response)\n(Table S6). Intriguingly, whilst both the C. elegans-specific and C.\nremanei-specific DAF-16 regulons also show overrepresentation of\ngenes involved in immunity (11 genes in C. elegans, 13 genes in C.\nremanei) and stress responses (38 genes in C. elegans, 14 genes in C.\nFigure 2. Quantitation of daf-16 gene expression.

Altogether, 1746 genes\nwere identified as putative DAF-16 targets in at least one of these\nother datasets and 678 of these were also identified by our\napproach, a group we refer to as the adjusted dataset. Of the 678\npotential C. elegans DAF-16 target genes, 283 overlap with the C.\nbrigssae dataset and 274 genes were found in the C. remanei list.

(Table 1). Interestingly, there\nis very little overlap between DAF-16 targets identified by ChIP\nand those inferred from microarray or bioinformatic analysis, with\nthe exception of 11 genes shared between Oh et al and McElwee\net al and 30 genes shared between Oh et al and our dataset. Thus\nthere is likely to be considerable benefit in combining a range of\nexperimental approaches in order to narrow down the list of true\nDAF-16 target genes.\nDiscussion\nIt is now clear that the lifespan of an organism is determined by\na combination of environmental conditions, stochastic factors\n(such as lifestyle) and genetic background. Numerous studies have\ndemonstrated that the evolutionarily conserved transcription\nFigure 6. The DAF-16 regulon based on an adjusted C. elegans dataset.

The homologues of daf-\n16 in other organisms have been shown to perform similar\nfunctions [18] and yet species differ significantly in terms of\nlifespan and immunity, raising the question of how such DAF-16\nmediated phenotypes have changed through evolutionary time.\nHere we show covariance of three DAF-16 mediated pheno-\ntypes, longevity, immunity and stress response, across the\nCaenorhabditis genus. Strikingly, the two gonochoristic species (C.\nremanei and C. brenneri) show significantly higher basal expression of\nDAF-16 than the shorter-lived hermaphroditic species C. elegans\nand C. briggsae. Thus, enhanced expression and\/or activation of\nDAF-16 may be an important mechanism by which species\nregulate a combination of phenotypes that enhance resistance to\nabiotic and biotic stresses and hence favour a longer life. The fact\nthat this pattern is seen in multiple isolates of two gonochoristic\nspecies may reflect their need to search for a partner to mate, a\nlifestyle that increases the chance of encountering stressful\nconditions (eg. pathogens, high temperature) and is likely to\nfavour the evolution of a longer lifespan in order to increase\nmating opportunities. In addition, since we know very little about\nthe natural ecology of the Caenorhabditis nematodes [43], it is\npossible that differences in the niches inhabited by these species\nmay impose extrinsic stresses that have led to the evolution of\nimproved stress tolerance via the over-expression of DAF-16.\nIt is interesting to note that susceptibility to several pathogens\ncorrelates with other DAF-16 mediated effects, with the exception\nof the Gram-negative bacterium S. typhimurium, which shows\nsimilar lethality in all four species and the two daf-2 mutants. Since\nS. typhimurium is one of the few human pathogens thus far shown to\nestablish a truly persistent infection in the worm due to its\nresistance towards antimicrobial peptides [25,44], this finding may\nindicate that DAF-16 plays little or no role in dealing with gut-\ncolonising pathogens.\nThe insulin-like signalling pathway contributes to both innate\nimmune responses and stress responses in C. elegans. Our data\nsuggests that this may also hold true in closely related nematode\nspecies. In line with this, we show that the components of this\npathway do not show evidence of adaptive sequence evolution\nduring the diversification of these species whereas the complement\nof putative downstream targets controlled by DAF-16 appear to\nvary between these species. All three sequenced species share a\ncore DAF-16 regulon comprised of genes functioning in longevity,\nstress response and other biological processes. However, whilst C.\nelegans and C. remanei contain a similar set of target types in their\nspecies-specific DAF-16 regulons, the species-specific DAF-16\nregulon of C. briggsae lacks genes involved in immunity and stress\nresponse. Interestingly, in line with this finding, we observed that a\ndaf-2 mutant in C. briggsae is long-lived and resistant to abiotic\nstress, but only moderately resistant to killing by a range of\npathogens.\nThe majority of enriched genes identified by our approach are\nassociated with other biological processes such as metabolism,\ntransport and other functions, in line with previous studies that\nhave identified downstream targets of DAF-16 in C. elegans\n[14,38,39,40,45,46]. We note, however, that such bioinformatic\nanalyses are susceptible to false positive (due to the chance\noccurrence of DAF-16 consensus sequences) and false negative\n(due to its reliance on perfect-match sequence motifs) errors.\nIndeed, depending on the approach used, others have estimated\nthat up to 78% of C. elegans genes might be potential DAF-16\ndownstream targets [42]. As such, we would emphasize that our\nbioinformatic analysis is intended only as a guide for future\nexperimental analyses once tools become available.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate covariance of DAF-16 mediated\nphenotypes in the four most well-characterized species of the\nCaenorhabditis clade. We note that our data are correlative but, as\nyet, cannot prove a causative influence of daf-16 expression level\non these phenotypes in the gonochoristic species. Currently,\ndemonstrating a direct role for DAF-16 in phenotypic covariance\nin the gonochoristic nematodes is not technically feasible. Very few\ngenetic mutants have been made in these species, RNA\ninterference is of low efficiency and no antibodies exist for\nchromatin immunoprecipitation approaches. However, many\ngroups are currently attempting to develop such tools for these\nspecies and, as such, we hope that a full mechanistic investigation\nof the IIS pathway in non-elegans species will be feasible within\nthe next few years.\nMaterials and Methods\nBacterial strains and growth conditions\nEscherichia coli OP50 [47], Salmonella typhimurium SL1344 [48],\nPseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 and Staphylococcus aureus NCTC8532\nwere grown in nutrient rich Luria-Bertani (LB) broth overnight\nwith shaking at 37u. The bacterial culture was then seeded onto\nstandard Nematode Growth agar Medium (NGM[47,49]) plates.\nThese plates were incubated overnight at 37u (,16 hrs) followed\nby storage at 4u. Plates were always equilibrated to room\ntemperature before use.\nWorm Strains\nWorm strains N2, RC301, CB4856 (wildtype Caenorhabditis\nelegans), AF16, ED3033, ED3034 (wildtype Caenorhabditis briggsae),\nEM464, JU1082, JU1084 (wildtype Caenorhabditis remanei), CB5161,\nLKC28, SB129 (wildtype Caenorhabditis brenneri), CB1370 [C. elegans\ndaf-2(e1370)], PS5531 [C. briggsae daf-2(sy5445)] and BA17\n[C.elegans fem-1 (hc17)] were grown on standard NGM plates\nseeded with OP50 strain of E. coli bacteria as a food source\n[47,49]. All strains except BA17 (which was grown at 25uC to\ninduce feminisation) were grown at 20uC. Fourth larval stage\nhermaphrodites from the hermaphroditic species and females from\nthe gonochoristic species were used for all the phenotypic assays\nperformed.\nLongevity\/Pathogen Assays\nThe hermaphroditic and gonochoristic strains of worms were\nbleached [49] to produce age-synchronous L4 molt populations.\nBetween 80 and 250 L4 worms from the hermaphroditic species,\nor females in the case of gonochoristic species, were transferred\nonto NGM plates (,30 worms per plate, yielding up to 10\nreplicates) seeded with OP50 for longevity assays and SL1344,\nPA01 and NCTC8532 for pathogen assays as food source.

Worms grown at 25uC on OP50 have been shown to\nhave a significantly longer lifespan than those grown on\npathogenic bacteria such as S. typhimurium [25] which eliminates\nthe negative effects of heat as an experimental determinant. The\nworms on all these plates were scored for survival every 24 hrs.\nAnimals were considered dead when they failed to respond to\nprodding by a platinum wire. The worms were transferred onto\nnew plates every one to two days until they stopped egg laying, in\norder to prevent F1 progeny from interfering with the experiment.\nHeat Shock Assay\nL4 worms from the hermaphroditic species, and females in the\ncase of gonochoristic species, were transferred onto NGM plates\nwith OP50 that had been prewarmed to 37u. These plates were\nthen incubated at 37uC and the worms were scored for survival at\nhourly intervals.\nMetallotolerance Assay\nAge synchronous L4 worms were transferred from NGM plates\ninto 24-well tissue culture plates containing copper chloride\n(7 mM) dissolved in K medium (53 mM NaCl, 32 mM KCl)\n[10,50]. The plate was incubated at 20uC and the worms were\nscored for survival every hour.\nStatistical Analysis\nSurvival curves were produced based on the Kaplan-Meier\nmethod using MS-Excel and the significance was calculated using\nthe non-parametric log-rank method. Assays were then corrected\nfor multiple testing using the Bonferroni correction.\nPreparation of total nematode mRNA and Quantitative\nRT PCR\nFor qRT-PCR, RNA was isolated from a mixed larval stage\npopulation of each of the four species of worms. These worms were\ngrown on NGM plates with OP50 as food source at 20u. Animals\nwere then washed off the plates using M9 buffer, followed by\nrepeated washes again with M9 buffer before being homogenized\nusing the Precellys 24 machine (Stretton Scientific). The RNA was\nthen isolated from these worm samples using the Qiagen RNeasy\nMini kit (cat. No. 74140) using the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA\nwas then reverse transcribed into cDNA using Superscript II reverse\ntranscriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-\ntions. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed (7300 Real\nTime PCR System; Applied Bio Systems) on this cDNA using the\nSYBRGreen PCR kit (Quantace) to determine the expression levels\nof daf-16 across the four species. Primers for this were designed\nmanually and tested for maximum efficiency with their respective\ncDNA prior to qRT-PCR. Primers used include daf-16 primers for\nC. elegans, C. briggsae, C. remanei and C. brenneri (Table 2).\nThe RT PCR levels were normalized to the housekeeping gene,\nGlyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (gpd-3). The primers\nfor this gene were; Primer Fwd \u2013 TGAAGGGAATTCTCGCT-\nTACACC and Primer Rev \u2013 GAGTATCCGAACTCGTTAT-\nCGTAC. We confirmed that our results were not due to variation\nin gpd-3 by cross checking RT PCR levels against another\nreference gene, 18sRNA, the primers for which were; Primer Fwd\n- TTCTTCCATGTCCGGGATAG and Primer Rev \u2013 CCCCA-\nCTCTTCTCGAATCAG. To assess the efficacy of the primers\nand the sensitivity of the qPCR assay, 2-fold dilution series of the\ntemplate DNA for all the species tested were prepared and\nsubjected to qPCR amplification. The results obtained were\nextrapolated to produce standard curves by linear regression\nanalysis between threshold cycle (Ct) and sample dilution that gave\ncoefficients of determination (r2) that exceeded 0.95 for all\ntemplate\/primer combinations (Table S9). Once amplification\nefficiencies of the target and the reference were determined to be\napproximately equal, RT PCRs were carried out for all the\nexperimental conditions. These results were analysed using the\nDCT method with the gpd-3 and 18S RNA levels as controls for\nnormalization and expressed as fold change compared to C. elegans\n[51].\nBioinformatic analysis of DAF-16 downstream targets\nThe complete genomes of C. elegans (20,189 genes), C. briggsae\n(21,976 genes) and C. remanei (31,614 genes) were downloaded\nfrom Wormbase release WS 197 (www. wormbase.org). We\nsurveyed a 3000 bp upstream flanking region of each gene\n(upstream of the lead ATG) for the presence of the two known\ncanonical DAF-16 binding sites (ttatttac\/gtaaataa, ttgtttac\/gtaaa-\ncaa; [52]). We applied a perfect match approach using the dna-\npattern tool implemented in the freely available software package\nRegulatory Sequence Analysis Tools (RSAT; http:\/\/rsat.bigre.ulb.\nac.be\/rsat\/; [53]). Only genes with upstream flanking region\ncontaining one or more perfect matches to the consensus sites were\nincluded in further analyses. From this set of genes we then\nretrieved a subset of genes for each species that are orthologous\neither between C. elegans and C. briggsae, C. elegans and C. remanei or\nbetween all three species. Based on these orthologous gene sets we\ndefined the following classes: i) a species-specific DAF-16-regulon,\nconsisting of orthologs that contain the consensus site in only one\nof the species, ii) the species-shared DAF-16 regulon, consisting of\northologous genes that contain the consensus site in two of the\nspecies and iii) the core-DAF-16 regulon, consisting of orthologs\nthat contain the consensus site in all three species. These gene\nsubsets were subsequently analysed in order to identify enriched\nfunctional gene groups. This analysis was performed using the\nfunctional annotation tools available from the non-commercial\nbioinformatic database DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visu-\nalization and Integrated Discovery) [54,55].\nTable 2.

These datasets were\ncombined, duplicates removed and subsequently run against the C.\nelegans gene list (containing all genes with a perfect match to one of\nthe binding motifs). The resulting gene list was then compared to\nthe lists obtained for C. briggsae and for C. remanei. The three\nresulting lists were analysed using the functional annotation tools\nin DAVID. Finally, we looked whether there was any overlap\nbetween the dataset of Oh and the datasets of Murphy, McElwee,\nLee, Halaschek-Wiener, Dong.\nWe determined the number of genes that were enriched within\nthe functional annotation category Gene Ontology GOTERM\nBP_ALL and especially enriched in GOTERM BP_2. The results\nwere obtained by using the Functional Annotation Chart tool. The\nGOTERMS BP are available from the DAVID database. The p-\nvalue obtained in this analysis is equivalent to the EASE score,\nwhich uses a conservative adjustment of the Fisher\u2019s exact\nprobability, and was applied to identify significantly enriched\ngene categories. DAVID provides several methods to correct for\nmultiple testing which include Bonferroni adjustment of the p-\nvalue, and the Benjamini-Hochberg approach to control for\nfamily-wide false positive rate. The fold enrichment value\nmeasures the magnitude of enrichment and is considered\nsignificant if 1.5 or above [54]. For more statistical details and\ndetailed description of the annotation methods used in DAVID\nplease refer to the cited references above and references therein.\nFor all orthologs, the corresponding WormBase IDs of C. elegans\ngenes were used as input files. Orthologs between C. remanei and C.\nbriggsae but not occurring in C. elegans could not be addressed with\nthis approach. All orthologous genes with a duplicate output in\none of the species were counted only as one gene.\nAdaptive sequence evolution\nAdaptive sequence evolution along the IIS pathway was studied\nin C. elegans, C. briggsae and C. remanei. Protein sequences and DNA\nsequences of the coding regions ranging from daf-2, age-1, pdk-1,\nakt-1, and daf-16 were obtained from WormBase WS197 (www.\nwormbase.org). Protein sequences and DNA coding regions were\naligned using ClustalX2 [56]. For each gene of interest, the\npresence of adaptive sequence evolution (ratio between synony-\nmous [KS] and non-synonymous [KA] substitutions) was calculat-\ned between a pair of sequences (C. elegans and C. brigssae; C. elegans\nand C. remanei; C. briggsae and C. remanei) using PAL2NAL [57].\nPAL2NAL calculates KS and KA by the codeml program in\nPAML. Briefly, pairwise protein alignments in CLUSTAL format\nand the corresponding DNA sequence alignments in FASTA\nformat were used as input files. The following option settings were\nused.
