Sign(iqcanee of soil magnetic propertiesjbr \npaleoclhnatie r construction \nPaleosols potentially constitute natural archives \nof paleoclimatic information. However, the integ- \nrity, accuracy and retrieval of this information \ndepend on: (1) the degree of development and \npreservation of diagnostic, soil-formed properties; \nand (2) whether these properties can be interpreted \nvia modern-day analogues. Multiple buried paleo- \nsols are preserved within long sequences (up to \n350 m) of Quaternary loess, most notably in the \nLoess Plateau of north-central China. Other, often \nshorter, loess\/paleosol sequences occur in disparate \nlocations such as Tajikistan (Forster and Heller, \n1994), Alaska (Beget et al., 1990), central North \nAmerica (Rousseau and Kukla, 1994), Siberia \n(Rutter and Chlachula, 1995), the Pampas of \nArgentina (Nabel, 1993), Tunisia (Dearing et al., \n1996b), France (Rousseau et al., 1994), Poland \n(Nawrocki, 1992), the Czech Republic (Kukla, \n1975) and India (Gupta et al., 1991). For all of \nthe above locations, mineral magnetic data have \nbeen obtained from the paleosols and their less \nweathered loess substrates. Mineral magnetic \nmeasurements are quantitative and relatively easily \nand rapidly made. Magnetic susceptibility, for \nexample, can be measured in the field using a \nhand-held probe, at high resolution (e.g. at 5 cm \nintervals over > 150 m stratigraphic thickness at \nthe Chinese Loess Plateau sites). In all cases, the \nmagnetic properties provide sensitive discrimina- \ntion between the loess units and the interbedded \npaleosols, and often form the basis for strati- \ngraphic correlation and matching with other cli- \nmate records, in particular the deep-sea oxygen \nisotope record. However, as for any sediment, \nvariations in magnetic properties can reflect \nchanges in any of the following: allogenic inputs: \nauthigenic inputs; and post-depositional diagen- \nesis. Thus, the nature of any causal links between \nclimate and magnetic properties i likely to be site- \nspec07c, as demonstrated, for example, by the \ninverse relationship between magnetic susceptibil- \nity in the Alaskan, Argentinian and Siberian paleo- \nsols and the Chinese paleosols. In China the \npaleosols have higher susceptibilities than their less \nweathered loess counterparts: in the other three \ncases, the completely opposite pattern is found, \nwith susceptibility minima corresponding to the \nmost developed pedogenic horizons. To account \nfor these opposite relationships, the mineralogy of \nthe susceptibility carriers, their sources, and their \ncausal links with climate, need to be identilied. \nIdentification of such sources and links is greatly \nassisted by knowledge of the magnetic properties \nof modern soils, especially if we can understand \nwhich climatic and soil-forming conditions favour \ntile in situ formation of strongly magnetic ferri- \nmagnets, and resulting net magnetic enhancement. \nand which are likely to promote ither loss of soil \niron or accumulation of non-ferrimagnetic iron \noxides, with net magnetic depletion or dilution. \nHere. proposed processes of enhancement and \ndepletion or dilution of soil magnetic susceptibility \nare first reviewed. Then, to investigate the relation- \nship between soil type and degree of magnetic \nenhancement or depletion, soil magnetic properties \nin a variety of modern soil-forming environments \nare investigated. To identify the magnetic arriers \nin magnetically enhanced soils, the mineralogy, \nmorphology and grain size of magnetically concen- \ntrated extracts have also been examined. Finally, \nthe links between magnetic enhancement and cli- \nmate, soil age and soil type are discussed with \nreference to paleosol magnetic properties and \npaleoclimate. \n1.2. Rock magnetic studies q\/soiL~\" \nMeasurements of soils, and paleosols, by mineral \nmagnetic techniques are highly specific to Fe, and \nvery sensitive to particular minerals, especially \nstrong ferrimagnets like magnetite \n( Fe3 + )t[ FEZ-, Fe3 +]004, where t = tetrahedral site \nand 0 = octahedral site. Current instrumentation is \nsufficiently sensitive to measure the remanent mag- \nnetisation from less than 1 ppb of magnetite. \nMagnetic measurements measure the in-field and \nremanent responses of samples to a series of exter- \nnally applied magnetic fields. In well drained soils, \nthese responses reflect the magnetic properties \nwhich arise from the mineralogy and grain size of \ntheir constituent iron oxides. In waterlogged soils, \nB.A. Maher \/ Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 137 (1998) 25 54 27 \niron sulphides, rather than oxides, may dominate \nthe soil magnetic properties (Stanjek et al., 1994). \nIn soils lacking any significant ferrimagnetic \ncontent, susceptibility may be carried by paramag- \nnetic components (such as Fe-rich clays, or the \niron oxides, ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite). Table 1 \nsummarises the magnetic status of the major iron \noxides and their measured magnetic susceptibility. \nThe susceptibility data were obtained from oxide \npowders kindly provided by Prof. U. \nSchwertmann, lnstitut J~r Bodenkunde, Freising. \nProcesses of iron mineral authigenesis, diagen- \nesis, transport and dissolution, in interaction with \nweathering inputs of iron, produce vertical differ- \nentiation in soil magnetic properties (Babanin \net al., 1975; Maher, 1984; Singer and Fine, 1989). \nRe-distribution of soils on slopes, by erosion and \ntransport processes, can also produce measurable \nmagnetic patterns (Maher, 1984; Dearing et al., \n1985). Thus, magnetic minerals can both respond \nto and reflect soil-forming processes. \nLe Borgne (Le Borgne, 1955, 1960) first \nobserved the variation in soil susceptibility values, \nnoting increased magnetic ontent ('enhancement') \nwithin the surface layers of burnt soil. He also \nobserved, however, that susceptibility values could \nincrease in the absence of soil burning, during the \ndrying phase of soil wetting\/drying cycles. Russian \nsoil physicists (for example, Babanin, 1973; \nBabanin et al., 1975; Vadyunina and Smirnov, \n1976) attempted large-scale application of suscepti- \nbility measurements to characterise the morphol- \nogy and genesis of major soil groups within the \nUSSR. M ullins (1974) and Mullins and Tite ( 1973 )\nfocused etailed attention on soil magnetic proper- \nties from the viewpoint of archaeological prospect- \ning. Tite and Linington (1975) were the first to \nspeculate on the effects of climate on soil magnetic \nsusceptibility. Mullins' (Mullins, 1977) review of \nmagnetic susceptibility of the soil provides a sum- \nmary of soil magnetic studies at this time. \nRecent advances in soil magnetic studies were \nprompted by magnetically based environmental \nstudies of sediment provenance and soil-sediment \nlinkages (Thompson and Oldfield, 1986). \nAssociations between different soil regimes and \nobserved magnetic haracteristics are reported in \nDearing (1979), Maher (1984) and Singer and \nFine (1989). \nQuantitative identification of soil magnetic \nmineralogies was sought by Longworth and Tite \n(1977) and Longworth et al. (1979), using \nM6ssbauer analysis to analyse (1) burnt and (2) \npedogenically enhanced soil material. Conversely, \nCoey (1988) has used the distinctive magnetic \nproperties of natural materials to spur theoretical \nprogress in the field of magnetism. \n1.3. Magnetic' differentiation i soils.\" magnetic \nenhancement versus magnetic 'depletion' \nThe iron oxides, together with amorphous, \norganically linked iron complexes, constitute the \nmajor forms of non-silicate iron in soils. Soil iron \noxides are weakly magnetic, in magnetic suscepti- \nbility terms, with the significant exception of the \nferrimagnets, magnetite and maghemite (Table I). \nWeakly magnetic oxides such as hematite and \ngoethite may occur in soils in amounts detectable \nby X-ray diffraction of bulk samples (~5-10%). \nTable 1 \nIron oxides in soils and their magnetic susceptibilities \nMineral Formula Magnetic Status Magnetic susceptibility \n(10 - sm 3 kg 1) \nHematite 3c Fe203 Canted antiferromagnetic 40 \nGoethite ~ FeOOH Canted antiferromagnetic 70 \nMaghemite ),Fe203 Ferrimagnetic 26000 \nLepidocrocite 7FeOOH Paramagnetic 70 \nFerrihydrite 5Fe203 -9H20a Paramagnetic 40 \nMagnetite Fe304 Ferrimagnetic 56500 \n\"After Schwertmann and Taylor (1977). \n28 B.A. Maher \/ Pahteo%eo~zr(q)hy, Palaeoclimatolo&~v, Palaeoecoloj4v 137 \/1998) 25 54 \nThe ferrimagnetic minerals most often occur in \ntrace amounts but often dominate measured soil \nmagnetic properties. Soil iron oxides were origi- \nnally thought to occur in amorphous form, as \nsurface coatings on minerals or voids: increased \nanalytical power can now resolve the cryptocrystal- \nline and sub-micrometre grains that either make \nup such features, or occur singly with the soil \nmatrix. \n1.3.1. Magnetic enhancement \nA soil may become magnetically enhanced if \nthere is: (1) conversion of some of the weakly \nmagnetic iron oxides (Table 1 ) or other Fe source \ninto the strongly magnetic ferrimagnets, magnetite \nand maghemite: (2) subsequent persistence of these \nferrimagnets in the soil profile; and (3) selective \nconcentration of any weathering-resistant de rital \nferrimagnets. Iron is released by weathering from \nprimary Fe2+-bearing minerals by oxidation at \nmineral surfaces. The Fe 3 + ions produced may be \nincorporated into an iron oxide phase in situ, or \nbe reduced and mobilised by the soil solution and \nsubsequently re-oxidise and precipitate lsewhere \nin the profile. Iron oxides can also be actively \ndissolved, with conversion to free or organically \nlinked iron forms. These processes of: (1) authi- \ngenesis, (2) diagenesis, (3) dissolution and (4) \nredistribution, in interaction with any detrital mag- \nnetic inputs, can be expected to produce differen- \ntiation of soil magnetic properties, under the \nconstraints et by the biogeochemical conditions \nof the developing profile. Included within these \nconditions, which govern the operation of the \n(No)chemical reactions within the soil, are the \nfactors of temperature, moisture availability, redox \nstatus, organic matter content, bacterial activity, \nand the initial proportions of the chemical com- \npounds of the system. \nWithin temperate soils, magnetic enhancement \nof upper soil layers, as evidenced by increased \nsusceptibility values, has been widely reported (e.g. \nLe Borgne, 1955 in France; Neumeister and \nPeschel, 1968 in Germany; Mullins and Tite, 1973: \nLongworth et al., 1979; Maher, 1984 in the U.K.: \nTite and Linington, 1975 in the U.K., \nMediterranean and the tropics: Singer and Fine, \n1989 in the U.S.A.). Susceptibility values can \nespecially be enhanced by the presence of minor \nconcentrations (<0.l%) of ultrafine-grained \n(< ~20 nm) ferrimagnets (Fig. 1). Proposed pro- \ncesses and products of enhancement (Table 2) were \nsummarised by Mullins (1977). New information \non specific pathways that may be involved in the \n~fermentation' process, during soil wetting\/drying \ncycles, has come from studies of magnetotactic \nbacteria (e.g., Fassbinder et al., 1990), Fe-reducing \nbacteria (Lovley et al., 1987) and low-temperature \nmagnetite synthesis (Tamaura et al., 1983: Taylor \net al., 1987). Magnetotactic bacteria lbrm distinc- \ntive chains of unidimensional, sub-micrometre \nmagnetite crystals intracellularly (Fig. 2a,b) and \nhave been suggested as a source of pedogenic \nmagnetite by Fassbinder et al. (1990), who first \nreported the presence of magnetotactic bacteria ill \na (gley) soil in Southern Germany. Maher and \nThompson (Maher and Thompson, 1991, Maher \nand Thompson. 1992) found fossil magnetosomes \nin paleosol $1 (Fig. 2c) from Luochuan in the \nChinese Loess Plateau, but in very small numbers \n(< 1% of extracted magnetic grains). Similarly, \nliving soil magnetotactic populations have so far \nonly been found in low numbers. < 100 bacteria\/ml \nof soil solution (Fassbinder et al.. 1990). However, \nthese authors uggest exponential increases in these \npopulations might occur under episodically favour- \nable soil conditions. Lovley et al. (1987) isolated \nan Fe-reducing bacterium, GS-15 (now named \nGeobacter metalloreducens), from surface sedi- \nments of the Potomac estuary, U.S.A. Fe-reducing \nbacteria use Fe 3\" either as a source of Fe atoms \nfor metabolism, or, more significantly, as an \nelectron sink during anaerobic respiration. Whilst \nGeobacter m. itself has not yet been isolated in \nsoils, more than 30 species of Fe-reducing soil \nbacteria have been identified (Fischer, 1988; \nRossellomora et al., 1995 ). Such bacteria may play \na key role in pedogenic formation of ultrafine- \ngrained magnetite (Fig. 2e), by their production \nand extracellular excretion of Fe e+ ions (Maher, \n1991 ). Once in the extracellular environment, he \ninteraction between the excreted Fe e- and ambi- \nent Fe 3 ~ ions may, under certain conditions, result \nin the inorganic precipitation of hundreds of \nultrafine magnetite crystals around each bacterium \nB.A. Maher \/ Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 137 (1998) 25 54 29 \nXlO-6m 3kg-~ \n1200 \n1100 \n1000 \n90C \n80C \n700 i \n6OO \n500 t\n400 I \n300 I\n200 I \n100 I \n0.01 \n0 0 \n0 \n0 \n000 0 0 0 \n\u2022 Zx New MT (Maher, 1988) \n\u2022 o Dankers (1978) \ni J , , , , , , ,  [ , , , , ,  i , , , : , , i  q , , , , , , . ,  .~ \/  a . , ~ , , ,  = = t = _ , . . a , e  ~4 \n0.05 o.1 % 5 lO 5o lOO o.o5 o.1 5 lO ~d - \nXFo % \n12 \n11 \n10 \n9 \n8 \n7 \n6 \n5 \n4 \n3 \n2 \nt \n100 \nGrain size (Hm) \nFig. 1.

The conditions in the extra- \ncellular, soil micro-environment which favour pre- \ncipitation of magnetite, rather than the other, \npoorly magnetic iron oxides, might be inferred \nfrom Taylor et al.'s (Taylor et al., 1987) laboratory \nexperiments on low-temperature magnetite synthe- \nsis. Rapid and easy synthesis of magnetite was \nachieved through controlled oxidation of mixed \nFeZ+\/Fe 3+ solutions at room temperature and \nnear-neutral pH values. The synthetic products \nwere found to range in size from 0.01 to 0.07 ~m \n(Fig. 2d). Conversely, other iron oxyhydroxides, \nespecially lepidocrocite and goethite, were formed \nin preference to magnetite when the pH was \nreduced, and\/or when the oxidation rate was \nincreased. The specific process by which magnetite \nwas formed in Taylor et al.'s experiments may be \nthat of 'induced hydrolysis' (Tamaura et al., 1983), \nwhereby Fe 2 + ions are adsorbed onto the surface \nof poorly crystalline Fe 3 + phases, such as ferrihy- \ndrite. This adsorption promotes dissolution of the \noxide phase, due to the resulting surface charge \nimbalance, and formation of an intermediate \nFe 2+\/Fe 3+ compound which then, under the \nappropriate pH and oxidation regime, may precipi- \ntate as magnetite. Because of the small size of \nmany of the precipitated crystals, surface oxidation \nof the magnetite to maghemite is likely to occur \nsubsequently, over periods of months to years \n(Murad and Schwertmann, 1993 and Maher, \nunpubl, data). Some grains may exist as cores of \nmagnetite with surface maghemitised coatings. \nM6ssbauer analysis of synthetic magnetite pow- \nders (Maher, 1988), stored in air for 10 years, \nidentified a small percentage (<5%) of surviving \nmagnetite amongst otherwise maghemitised grains. \nMaghemitisation may play an important role in \nthe persistence of the fine-grained ferrimagnets in \nthe soil profile, protecting the inner magnetite core \nfrom dissolution. \nUsing Lowenstam's (Lowenstam, 1981 ) termi- \nnology, extracellular formation of magnetite via \nthe mediation of Fe-reducing bacteria may be \ntermed a 'Biologically Induced Mineralisation' \n(BIM) process; intracellular magnetite production \nby magnetotactic bacteria constitutes a \n'Biologically Organised Mineralisation' (BOM) \nprocess. BOM processes involve construction by \nthe organism of an intracellular organic frame- \nwork, into which the required ions are actively \ntransported and induced to crystallise and grow at \ncontrolled rates.

Magnetite crystals formed \naround Geobacter (Lovley et al., 1987) were very \nvariable in crystal size, with many tiny, superpara- \nmagnetic rystals, due to their rapid, uncontrolled \nprecipitation. Lovley et al. (1987) suggest some \norganic control on mineralisation is exerted by \nGeobacter m.: it is possible that the rate of excre- \ntion of Fe 2 + favours formation of magnetite over \nother iron oxides. Given the narrow range of \nconditions suitable for activity by Fe-reducing \nbacteria (i.e., in locally anoxic micro-zones, with \nsuitable pH and organic supply) and the likely \npresence of interfering mineral grains, the grain \nsize of the precipitating magnetite can be expected \nto be uncontrolled but biased to the uhrafine size \nrange (< ~0.03 lam), Such ultratine ferrimagnetic \ngrains are easily identified by measurements of\nfrequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility, \nwhich are especially sensitive to the presence of \ngrains ~0.016 0.023 btm in size (Fig. 1).

Thus, frequency-dependent sus- \nceptibility measurements respond to a specific, \nnarrow proportion of the ultrafine grain size \nspectrum (Maher, 1988). \n1.3.2. Magnetic 'depletion' and~or dilution \nIn soil horizons dominated by mobilisation \nand\/or loss of iron by processes of weathering and \nsubsequent reduction or chelation by organic om- \npounds, neither accumulation of iron oxides nor \nconversion to ferrimagnetic forms is likely to occur. \nRather, net depletion of iron may proceed during \nsoil formation under such conditions. However, \neven in soils which are accumulating iron oxides, \nlow magnetic values can arise, through dominant \nformation (by oxidation) of weakly magnetic \nFe 3 + oxides (i.e., little conversion to ferrimagnets). \nThe poorly magnetic iron oxides nearly always \noccur in much higher concentrations than the \nferrimagnetic forms; iron oxides may typically \ntotal between 2 and 5 wt%, but the ferrimagnetic \ncontent is typically less than 0.1%. Thus, there is \noften little direct correlation between soil iron \ncontent and measured magnetic susceptibilities, as\nmay be seen from Fig. 3a (data drawn from Fine \net al., 1995) and Fig. 3b, from Dearing et al. \n(1996a). Fine et al.'s (Fine et al., 1995) data \ndemonstrate otal absence of correlation between \nsusceptibility and total iron for a number of \nChinese loess and paleosol samples (susceptibility \nvarying f romamin imumof l8x l0  8m 3kg-1 in \na loess sample to 199 x 10 s m 3 kg-1 in a paleosol \nsample). Dearing et al. (1996a) report positive, \nalbeit weak, correlation between total Fe and soil \nmagnetic susceptibility (0.32 at a significance l vel \nof p=0.0001) and argue that Fe supply, via the \nformation of ferrihydrite, is the major limiting \nfactor on the concentration of pedogenically \nformed ferrimagnets. However, an alternative view \nis that two distinct populations appear in this data \nset. The low-susceptibility, almost linear, grouping \nis probably dominated by Fe present within the \nweakly magnetic oxides, hematite and\/or goethite \nand paramagnetic minerals, such as Fe-silicates \nand iron oxyhydroxides (e.g., lepidocrocite). The \nmore scattered, higher susceptibility group almost \nresembles a normal distribution: it identifies a \nminimum Fe content of ~ 10 g\/kg, below which \nsusceptibility enhancement, by formation of ferri- \nmagnets, is unlikely. Conversely, high susceptibilit- \nies do not associate with high total Fe contents. \nThus, an alternative interpretation of this data set \nwould be that, given a minimum amount of avail- \nable weathered iron, Fe content will rarely be a \nlimiting factor for magnetic enhancement: rather, \nopportunities for ferrimagnetic onversion and \npreservation may be the key constraint. The \ninterplay between formation of ferrimagnets (e.g., \nmagnetite) and non-ferrimagnets (e.g., hematite), \nrespectively, is probably competitive and may thus \ndetermine the degree of magnetic enhancement \n(Maher and Thompson, 1995). Oxidation favours \nformation and accumulation of the non-ferrimag- \nnets, intermittent reduction is required for forma- \ntion of the ferrimagnets. \nSoils which accumulate relatively large concen- \ntrations of weakly magnetic omponents, uch as \norganic matter, quartz and clay minerals, may also \ndisplay apparent magnetic depletion, through dilu- \ntion effects. \nThe interplay between weathering and formation \nof non-ferrimagnets and ferrimagnets will thus \ndetermine the magnetic ontent of a soil, in terms \nof magnetic oncentration, mineralogy and grain \nsize. Fig. 4, for instance, shows the variation in \nmagnetic properties with soil particle size for a \ncambisol (brown earth) on dolerite in northwest \nScotland. The magnetic properties of this soil are \ndominated by weathering inputs of igneous magne- \ntite particles from the substrate; thus, the highest \nconcentrations of magnetic material are found in \nthe sand and silt size fractions. Fig. 5 shows the \nchanges in: (1) particle size distribution and (2) \nthe susceptibility of each particle size fraction, \nfrom the lower soil (16 22 cm) to the upper soil \n(0 4cm) horizons. It is clear that weathering of \nthe detrital ferrimagnetic particles has diminished \nthe susceptibility of the sand and coarse silt frac- \ntions, whilst magnetic enrichment has occurred in \nthe fine silt and clay fractions. Comminution of \nmagnetic particles will contribute some of this finer \nfraction enrichment; measurements of frequency- \ndependent susceptibility suggest that there has also \nbeen some neoformation of ultrafinc magnetic \nB.A. Maher \/ Palaeogeographv Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 137 (1998) 25-54 33 \n200 \n180 \n160 \n140 \n120 \nXLF  100 \n( tOBm 3 kg l )  \n8O \n60 \n4O \n20 \n0 \n(a) \n1 \n10 \nFe to ta l  (g \/kg)  \n.= \nQ \n100 \n5oo] \n400! \no \n*'~ 200-  \n1 0 0 -  \n\u2022 -\u2022  \u2022\u2022 \n0 \no 6~ ;o \n\u00b0\u00b0 \n\u00b0 \u00b0\u2022  \n\u2022 \u00b0 \u2022 \n\u2022 \u2022 \u00b0\u2022  \nt \n\u2022 o \u2022\u2022\u2022  \u2022 .= \n\u2022 . \u00b0 .  \"..; ; : \n\u2022 \"-\u00b0 \u2022 \u2022 . \u00b0~ \u2022 o \n\u2022 - '\u2022 .\u2022 .

Sites and methods \nTo examine the relationships between soil type, \nand degree and distribution of magnetic enhance- \nment, a range of soil profiles was sampled, first \nfrom a toposequence in southwest England, and \nthen from archived material at the Soil Survey of \nEngland and Wales (Appendix A). Analytical data \nfor the latter soils were available in published \nMemoirs. The range of samples was designed to \ninclude representatives of the major temperate \nzone soil types, encompassing cambisols, podsols, \nintergrades between them and gleysols. For each \nhorizon in each profile, samples were subjected to \nmeasurements of magnetic susceptibility (at low \nand high frequencies), anhysteretic remanence \n(ARM) and selected isothermal remanences \n(IRMs, at 40, 100 and 300roT). Definition of \nthese magnetic parameters can be tbund in \nThompson and Oldfield (1986). The toposequence \nsamples were taken from a south-facing slope in \nExmoor National Park, U.K., underlain by \nDevonian slate. Over a 500 m transect, descending \nfrom the moorland plateau at ~450 m, four soil \ntypes were identified: a humic stagnogley, a stagno- \nB.A. Maher \/ Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 137 (1998) 25 54 35 \npodsol, a dystric cambisol and an imperfectly \ndrained valley gleysol. The cambisol and podsol \nmembers of this sequence were investigated pre- \nviously (Maher, 1984). Each was sampled from \nexcavated soil pits or soil cores. For the Soil Survey \nsamples, the degree of correlation between the \nmagnetic parameters and available soil analytical \ndata was examined by calculating Pearson product \ncorrelation coefficients from a correlation matrix \nincluding susceptibility, saturation remanence \n(SIRM), sample depth, clay (<2~tm) content, \norganic carbon, cation exchange capacity and, \nwhere available, pyrophosphate-, oxalate-, and \ndithionite-extractable iron. \nTo examine the mineralogy, grain size and mor- \nphology of the magnetic material formed by \nenhancement, an additional, smaller number of \nenhanced soils was sampled, for magnetic and \npetrographic analysis of both bulk samples and \nmagnetic extracts obtained from them. These \nsamples (Table 3) included three modern soil pro- \nfiles developed on 'non-magnetic' parent materials \n(namely, calcium carbonate and slate), and a last \nglacial\/interglacial, loess\/paleosol couplet (L1 and \n$1) from Luochuan in the Chinese Loess Plateau. \nAll of the soils are characterised by much higher \nvalues of magnetic susceptibility, frequency-depen- \ndent susceptibility and ARM in their mineral hori- \nzons than in their parent substrates. \nFor magnetic measurements, soil samples were \nindividually sealed in labelled polythene bags for \ntransport to the laboratory, where they were oven \ndried overnight at 40\"C. Between 10 and 15 g of \nthe dried soil were gently disaggregated and sieved \nthrough a 2 mm sieve, with the <2 mm fraction \nthen packed into pre-weighed l0 cm 3 plastic cylin- \nders, sealed with plastic caps, To avoid particle \nmovement during measurement cycles, clean plas- \ntic foam was used to 'bed-down' the samples. \nMagnetic measurements were then made on each \nsample. \nFor extraction of the magnetic minerals, the \nbulk samples were first separated into two particle \nsize fractions by dispersion and wet sieving through \na 38 jam sieve. The magnetic properties of the \n>38 ~xm fractions were measured to identify the \nproportion of magnetic material they contained. \nThe <38 gm fractions were re-dispersed (with \nCalgon and ultrasonics) and then subjected to a \nhigh-gradient magnetic extraction procedure \n(Petersen et al., 198& Hounslow and Maher, \n1996). This procedure, designed to extract even \nsubmicrometre ferrimagnetic grains, produces two \nextracts. One extract concentrates the ultrafine, \nsubmicrometre fraction; the other, the fine \n(~2 38 ~tm) fraction, The non-extracted residues \nwere recovered from suspension by centrifuging, \nand their magnetic properties measured to deter- \nmine the amounts of magnetic material removed. \nFor the > 38 ~tm fractions, magnetic extraction by \nthe magnetic edge method (Hounslow and Maher, \n1996) was applied. The non-extracted residues of \nthe >38 ~tm fractions were also recovered from \nsuspension, dried and re-measured for susceptibil- \nity, ARM and SIRM. These before- and after- \nextraction magnetic measurements enable quanti- \nfication of the amount of magnetic material \nextracted from the soil fractions at each extrac- \ntion stage. \nThe magnetic extracts were analysed by scanning \nand transmission electron microscopy (S\/TEM), \nenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) and \nX-ray diffraction. \nTable 3 \nMagnetic properties of enhanced soils used for magnetic extraction \nSample Z ~fd Zfd ZARM SIRM ZARM\/SIRM \n(10 Sm3kg 1) (10 t~m3kg 1) (%) (10~,m3kg-1)  (10-3Am2kg l) (10 SAm 1) \nPSBE Exmoor cambisol 91 9 9.9 3.9 4.71 82.8 \nBY Cotswold rendzina 450 41.6 9.2 21.7 16.6 131 \nCY Norfolk rendzina 87 7.2 8.3 10.4 6.3 166 \nQJSI Luochuan palaeosol 200 21.3 10.7 14.2 10.3 138 \nQJL1 Luochuan loess 70.4 4.8 6.8 3.4 7.4 45.8 \nEX\nSG\n \n~\n(F\nD\n %\n \n4 \n0 \nB\n \n1\n2\n \n::\n::\nI:\n::\n::\n::\n \nO\nm\nl \n1\n0\n \nm\n2\n \no \n4\n7\n \ng \n~\n. \n2\n0\n \nm\n \n~\n \n- \n_ \n4\n7\n \n3\n0\n \nB\n\/C\n \n01\n \n10\n0 \n1\n0\n0\n0\n \n~\n'L\nF\n \n\u2022\n \nX\nL\nF\n \nlO\nB\nm\n3\nk\ng\n \n1 \n..\n..\n. \n~\n(F\nD\n %\n \nO\nm\n~\n \nS\no\nil\n h\no\nri\nz\no\nn\n \n4\n5\n \np\nH\n \nEX\nPO\nD \nX\n \nFD\n %\n \n0 \n4 \n8 \n0 \n::\n \ni \ni \ng\n 1\u00b0\n L s } 2\n0 \n(3\n \n3O\n 1 \n1\n0\n \n1\n0\n0\n \n~\n1~\n LF\n \nPB\nE \n1\n2\n I ra, 47 Om 2 Eag 47 Bs 47 \nX\nFo\n%\n \n\/C\n \n0 \n4 \n8 \n1\n2\n \n1\n0\n0\n0\n \n.-\n\"~\n \ngl\nO\n \n! \nh\n \ns:\n \no\n \n}\n \nr- j\n \nk \n::\n.:\n:.\n::\n::\n::\n :\n: \n..\n..\n \n1 \n~;\n, \n55\n \n1 \n1\n0\n \n1\n0\n0\n \n1\n0\n0\n0\n \nX\nL\nF\n \nPV\nG \n~\n(F\nD\n%\n \n1\n2\n \no \n4 \n8, \no ~\n: ~:\ni:h\n, \n1 \n~\n\" \n~\n \nB\ng\n \n~\n. \n..\n..\n \n..\n..\n..\n..\n \n..\n..\n..\n..\n..\n..\n..\n \n~\n \n5 \n2\n0\n \n..\n..\n..\n \nB\n\/C\n \nF \n1\n0\n \n1\n0\n0\n \n1\n0\n0\n0\n \n~\n( L\nF \nFi\ng.\n 7\n.

Exmoor toposequence \nFig. 7 shows for the Exmoor toposequence (the \nstagnogley, the podsol, the cambisol and the valley \ngley) the variations in their magnetic properties \nwith depth. The slate substrate has very low values \nof susceptibility (< 10 x 10 -s m 3 kg-~), < 1% fre- \nquency-dependent susceptibility, unmeasurable \nARM, and a low SIRM\/susceptibility ratio \n(~ 1 k Am-~). Its coercivity of remanence is very \nhigh, > 400 mT (Fig. 8). These data indicate that \nthis substrate contains low concentrations of a \nvery hard (canted antiferromagnetic) magnetic \ncomponent, such as hematite or goethite, and also, \ngiven the low SIRM\/susceptibility value, some \nparamagnetic minerals, such as Fe-rich clays. The \nfour profiles developed from this magnetically \ndistinctive parent material display quite different \nmagnetic signatures. The podsol and the plateau \nstagnogley soils are both characterised by very low \nvalues of susceptibility (<20 x 10 -~ m 3 kg-]), and \nbarely detectable frequency-dependent susceptibil- \nity (< 1%). They display slight peaks in susceptibil- \nity and SIRM at the surface of the organic peat; \nthe underlying peat layers have extremely low \nsusceptibility and SIRM values. Even within the \nmineral soil layers, the magnetic content is very \nlow. The higher values of susceptibility and SIRM \nin these profiles occur towards the C horizon; in \nthe podsol, highest values occur in association \nwith the iron pan (Br~) and the spodic (iron-rich) \nB, horizon.

Within the surficial \nsoil layers, coercivity values are generally slightly \nlower than those of the substrate (Fig. 8a). In \ncontrast to these two soils, the cambisol profile \ndisplays relatively high values of susceptibility \n( ~ 100 x 10 -8 m 3 kg ~), frequency-dependent \nsusceptibility (~ 10%) and SIRM (up to \nl0 x 10 3 Am 2 kg ~). The magnetic content \nincreases with decreasing soil depth, reaching a \npeak within the middle of the A horizon \n(~4 10 cm depth). Upon demagnetisation, \nsamples from this profile display much softer \nbehaviour, with coercivity values of between 21 \nand 30 mT (Fig. 8c). The imperfectly drained soil, \nprone to seasonal wetness, displays low values of \nsusceptibility and ARM down to ~ 8 cm depth. \nThis soil displays yellow mottles of oxidised iron, \nand an accumulation ( ~ 4 cm) of slowly decompos- \ning organic matter at its surface. Below -8  cm, \nsusceptibility and ARM values begin to rise stee- \nply, reaching maxima in the B horizon, at \n18 cm depth. Susceptibility values reach \n339 x 10 -8 m 3 kg ~, and frequency-dependent sus-\nceptibility values are typically between 9% and \n11%. This profile is unlike other imperfectly \ndrained soils, which have been reported to be \ndeficient in pedogenic magnetite (Maher, 1984: \nSinger and Fine, 1989). It was sampled at the \nend of an exceptionally warm, dry summer \n(September, 1995). \nThese results show that disparate development \nof magnetic properties occurs under different soil- \nforming conditions, even in soils developed on the \nsame parent material and within 500 m distance \nof each other. Within the cambisol and the subsoil \nof the valley ~gley', net formation of ferrimagnets \nhas occurred. In the cambisol, either uniformity \nof process and\/or effective mixing is suggested by \nthe similarity of susceptibility values down to a \ndepth of ~ 18 cm: in the valley gley, magnetite \nformation seems to have occurred preferentially in\nthe subsoil. Although this soil could be influenced \nby colluvial inputs, there is little evidence of soil \nerosion on this slope, which is under permanent \ngrassland pasture. In the plateau gley and the \npodsol, absence or loss of iron is indicated t~r \nthe organic, eluvial and gleyed horizons. \nAccumulation of magnetically very stable material \nis identified at 24 cm in the podsol, at the iron \npan-capped Bs horizon. Processes of iron oxide \ndissolution dominate in these latter soils, resulting \nin net magnetic depletion. \nThese magnetic results can be complemented by \nuse of differential iron extractions, dissolution \ntechniques routinely used by soil scientists to infer \nthe distribution and transformation of iron miner- \nals. Following the methods of McKeague et al. \n( 1971 ) and Schwertmann (1973), pyrophosphate- \nextractable iron (reported to represent organically \ncomplexed iron) and dithionite-extractable iron \n(representing crystalline, inorganic iron) were \ndetermined for the podsol and cambisol profiles. \nThese extractions were performed by Prof. E. \nMaltby, at Exeter University. Fig. 9 shows the \ndata obtained. Correlation between the chemical \ndata and the magnetic data is striking. For the \npodsol, the lack of dithionite-extractable iron in \nthe upper part ot\" the profile indicates that mobili- \nsation of iron has occurred, counteracting the \nsupply of organically linked iron from the surface \norganic mat. Re-deposition of the mobilised iron \nis clearly shown below ~ 25 cm depth, by increased \nvalues of both dithionite- and pyrophosphate- \nextractable iron. For the cambisol, the extraction \ndata indicate homogeneity, especially within the A \nhorizon. Dithionite values are higher in the A, \nshowing accumulation and increased crystallisa- \ntion of iron oxides. The slightly raised Fep\/F%c b\nratio at the surface suggests ome leaching and \ntranslocation, but this effect is countered by 4 cm \ndepth. \n3.2. UK soil surv O, samples \nStatistical analysis of magnetic data obtained \nfor a range of soils from the Soil Survey of England \nwas done with two aims: frst, to examine further \nthe relationships between soil and horizon types, \nand the degree of magnetic enhancement; second, \nto identify any correlation between soil magnetic \nproperties and other chemical and physical soil \nproperties.

Whilst they cover a wider spat- \nial scale, the number of samples is quite small and \nsampling was done at much coarser depth reso- \nlutions than the Exmoor set. Also, many of the \ncambisol profiles are, by their nature, of agricul- \ntural value and use, and subject to disturbance. \nNotwithstanding these caveats, these samples, as \nwith the Exmoor set, also exhibit distinct associa- \ntion between soil and horizon type, and soil mag- \nnetic properties. Fig. 10 shows the classification \nobtained and its relationship with the Soil Survey \nhorizon classification. The horizon types most \ncommonly associated with low magnetic ontribu- \ntions to the profile are weathering B\/Cs, B horizons \nand gleyed horizons. Horizons most commonly \nshowing magnetic enhancement are the well \ndrained A and Ap horizons of cambisols. Using \nthe magnetic data from: ( 1 ) the cambisol horizons, \nand (2) the podsol horizons, Pearson product \ncorrelation coefficients were calculated from a cor- \nrelation matrix including susceptibility and SIRM, \nand other, more conventional soil analyses \n(Tables 4 and 5). For the cambisol profiles, suscep- \ntibility and S1RM showed small but significant, \npositive correlation with organic carbon, cation \nexchange capacity and clay content. Neumeister \nand Peschel (1968) and Woodward et al. (1994) \nalso report positive correlation between magnetic \nsusceptibility and organic carbon. Susceptibility \nalso showed some correlation (p =0.55) with pyro- \nphosphate-extractable iron, but not with dithio- \nnite-extractable iron. SIRM showed no significant \ncorrelation with either pyrophosphate- or dithio- \nnite-extractable iron. For the podsol profiles, sus- \nceptibility and SIRM showed correlation with \ncation exchange capacity; susceptibility was also \nstrongly correlated (p = 0.93) with pyrophosphate- \nextractable iron. \n40 B.A. Maher ..

Classification ofUK Soil Survey soils by cluster analysis \nof magnetic data. Clustering was initially based on the values \nof all the measured ata (susceptibility, SIRM, ARM, inter- \nparametric ratios and demagnetisation parameters). However, \nhighest discrimination was afforded by just three parameters: \nsusceptibility~ SIRM and ARM. Classification was also aided \nif proportional, rather than absolute, data values were used. \n(The large range in absolute values produced clustering biased \ntowards those few samples with very high values, with conse- \nquently poor discrimination for the majority of samples with \nintermediate or low values). The proportional values were cal- \nculated as percentages of the profile totals for each parameter. \n3.3. Magnet ic  extract ions f i 'om enhanced pm?\/iles \nTable 3 shows some magnetic data for some \nmodern enhanced soils, and a Chinese \nloess\/paleosol couplet, prior to quantitative mag- \nnetic extraction. The sample from Broadway has \nthe highest susceptibility value (450x 10 -~ \nm 3 kg-  1). Fig. 11 plots the Zfa and ARM data for \nthese samples, and for some ferrimagnets of  known \ngrain size. Fig. 12 shows the Z, ARM and SIRM \nof each of the <38 jam and the >38 jam size \nfractions, and their respective contribution (given \nthe particle size distribution) to the bulk sample \nmagnetic value. All the samples display higher \nvalues of  Z, ARM and SIRM in their < 38 btm size \nfractions than their >38 ~tm fractions, with the \nexception of  the Exmoor cambisol (PSBE); the \nZ of  the two size fractions is nearly equal. \nMeasurement of  susceptibility, ARM and SIRM \nat each magnetic extraction step allows calculation \nof: (1) the absolute extraction efficiency of  the \nprocedures, and (2) the percentage of the total \nmeasured magnetisation removed by extraction. \nFig. 13 shows the extraction data obtained. For \nthe individual size fractions, the susceptibility \nextraction efficiency (Xeff) is very variable, from as \nlow as 15% to as high as 88%. In terms of total \nsample susceptibility (i.e., taking into account the \nparticle size distributions and their respective con- \ntributions to susceptibility), the magnetic extracts \ncontain between 24% and 49% (mean=36%) of \nthe susceptibility carriers. In terms of ARM,  the \nabsolute extraction efficiencies vary between 34% \nand 83%: as percentages of the total remanence, \nthe extracts contain between 53% and 83% \n(mean= 70%) of the ARM carriers. Similarly, for \nS IRM, absolute extraction efficiencies are between \n28% and 88%: as percentages of  the total SIRM, \nthe extracts contain between 34% and 78% \n(mean = 58%) of  the SIRM-carrying material. \nLower proportions of the susceptibility carriers \n(29 49%) are extracted compared with the rema- \nnence carriers; significant quantities of  the suscepti- \nbility-carrying rains remain in the \"non-magnetic' \nresidues. Thus, although the ARM-carriers (grains \naround the SD\/SP boundary, 40.03 jam in magne- \ntite and maghemite) are efficiently extracted, the \nultrafine, SP grains, contributing significantly to \nsusceptibility, are poorly extracted. In fact, fre- \nquency-dependent susceptibility data show that the \n< 38 jam residues are significantly em'iched, post- \nextraction, in their superparamagnetic (SP) \ncontent. For both ARM and SIRM, in excess of  \n50% of the remanence carriers were extracted for \nall the samples, with the exception of the highly \nmagnetic Broadway sample, for which only 34.4% \nof the S IRM carriers was obtained. This anoma- \nlously low extraction rate may indicate the pres- \nence of  significant numbers of interacting SP grains \nB.A. Maher \/ Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 137 (1998) 25-54 41 \nTable 4 \nCorrelation coefficients for Soil Survey samples, magnetic and conventional soil analyses: Podsol profiles \nORGC Fep Fed CEC CLAY 7.

Similar mineral assemblages dominate the \n2 38 lam and > 38 ~am extracts, with quartz, spinels \nand hematite being the major components. Other \nminerals, carrying no magnetic remanence, but \nappearing as minor components of the >2 btm \nmagnetic extracts are Fe-rich clays and silicates. \nIn the Broadway sample, carbonate appears in the \n>2 gm magnetic extract. This is a diamagnetic \nmineral; its extraction by magnetic means may \nindicate the presence of magnetic inclusions, such \nas the bacterially produced magnetosomes seen in \nCretaceous chalk samples, or binding of magnetic \nparticles to the carbonate (Hounslow and Maher, \n1996). It is not possible, however, for the observed \nlevel of magnetic enhancement in the Broadway \nsoil to result solely from chalk dissolution and \nconcentration of magnetic detritus. Susceptibility \nvalues for bulk chalk samples are not measurable \n(due to the diamagnetic nature of chalk), but \nSIRM values are typically 0.01-0.1 x 10 s \nAm 2kg ~ After dissolution of the carbonate, \nSIRM values for the remaining detrital fraction \nare around 0.05 0.15x10 SAmekg-1 .  In con- \ntrast, SIRMs for the Broadway rendzina are \n~16x 10-3 Am2 kg 1. \n3.3.2. Electron microscopy \nTransmission electron microscopy of the < 2 lam \nextracts reveals the dominant presence of reason- \nably well crystalline, submicrometre magnetic \ngrains, of very variable grain size (Fig. 15a-e). \nThe largest grains are ~0.4 ~tm; the smallest, which \noften occur as clusters around larger grains \n(Fig. 15c), are <0.001 gm. Grain size distributions \ncan be estimated from micrographs; Fig. 16 shows \nthe grain size distribution obtained from Fig. 15b. \nHowever, given that only 30-50% of the suscepti- \nbility carriers were extracted and the additional \ndifficulty in microscopically resolving the finest \ngrain sizes, these grain size data probably signifi- \ncantly over-estimate the actual grain size mean \nand mode. Only rarely are chains or groups of \nunidimensional particles observed (Fig. 15e). As \npreviously observed for paleosol Ss from the \nChinese loess plateau, these crystals, presumably \nformed by magnetotactic bacteria, make up less \nthan 1% of the total extracted assemblages. \nMagnetotactic bacteria therefore make an insig- \nnificant contribution to the single domain.,' \nsuperparamagnetic ferrimagnets found in \nenhanced soils and paleosols. \nScanning electron microscopy of the ~ 2 38 ~m \nmagnetic fractions identifies the morphology and \nelemental range of the detrital magnetic ompo- \nB.A. Maher \/ Pulaeogeography, PcdaeoclimatoloEy, PalaeoecoloL:v 137 (1998) 25 54 43 \n800 \n700'  \n600\" \n500  \n400 \n300 \n200 \n'~ '~ '~ '~ '~ '~ '~ '~ \nffl \n2500 \n2000 \n[ ]   ,rac, \n1500 \n[ ]  X contrib.

Many of the larger grains (up \nto ~ 10 ~m) are geometric and well crystallized, \nconsisting of minerals resistant to weathering; they \ninclude quartz, a range of Fe-silicates and chro- \nmites. Crystals dominantly composed of Fe, pre- \nsumably representing the spinels identified by \nXRD, are commonly the smaller grains (~2 ~tm) \nin the extract. The 2-38 ~tm extract from the \nNorfolk rendzina is notable for its concentration \nof carbonate fragments, which, upon elemental \nanalysis, contain both calcium and iron. This may \nreflect a ferroan calcite composition, or the pres- \nence of magnetic inclusions. A pre-extraction dis- \nsolution step (Hounslow and Maher, 1996), with \nremoval of the carbonate by acetic acid, would be \nrequired to identify the source of the Fe content. \nDetrital grains (>2 lam) constitute up to 98% of \nthe weight of the magnetic extracts, but display \nbetween 13% and 48% of the measured susceptibil- \nity of the <2 ~tm fraction. (The susceptibility of \nthe < 2 lam fraction is itself likely to be a significant \nunder-estimate, since there is serious under-extrac- \ntion of the superparamagnetic grains). The sedi- \nmentary substrates of these soils were previously \ndescribed (e.g. Maher and Taylor, 1988) as 'non- \nmagnetic', in that their bulk susceptibility values \nwere very low.

Given the presence of ferrimag- \nnetic detrital particles (>2 lam) in each of the \nsubstrates examined here, to describe them as \"non- \nmagnetic' is thus, sensu stricto, inaccurate. \nHowever, for all but the Exmoor cambisol, the \nfine-grained, pedogenic magnetic omponent is the \ndominant contributor to the enhanced susceptibil- \nity and remanence values. \n3.3.3. Thermomagnetic data \nInterpretation of changes in magnetic behaviour \nupon heating of soils is often difficult, due to \ntransformations during heating of the iron oxide \nphases and also Fe-rich clay minerals, under reduc- \ning conditions caused by combustion of organic \nmatter. However, thermomagnetic analyses can be \nused to exclude the possibility of fire as an enhance- \nment mechanism at the Exmoor sites. Soil firing \ncan cause temperatures in the surface layer of soils \nto reach as high as 800C and result in formation \nof ferrimagnets by reduction of other, weakly \nmagnetic iron oxides and Fe-bearing clays. Upon \nlaboratory heating, the two enhanced Exmoor soils \nboth show large increases in magnetisation at \n~210'C (Fig. 17), attributable to the conversion \nof lepidocrocite to maghemite (Van der Marel, \n1951 ). This behaviour is exhibited throughout the \nmineral horizons of these soils. If these soils had \npreviously been burnt, any lepidocrocite would \nalready have been converted, and further increases \nin magnetisation would not be seen in the labora- \ntory heating. Lepidocrocite is a weakly magnetic \n(paramagnetic) oxide, previously reported only in \ngleyed soils (Brown, 1953: Schwertmann and \nTaylor, 1977), often occurring together with goe- \nthite. It is likely that this restricted reported occur- \nrence of lepidocrocite is an artifact, reflecting the \nuse of bulk X-ray diffraction to identify its presence \nor absence\u2022 Such analysis would fail to identify \nthe presence of this mineral in trace amounts (as \nis commonly the case for the ferrimagnets also). \nIt seems likely that any of the iron oxide species \nmay occur ill any soil, depending on conditions at \nthe micro-environmental scale. \nIt is also interesting to note that, of the soils \nB.A. Maher \/ Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatoh)gy, Pakwoecoh)gy 137 (1998) 25 54 45 \n6400\"  \nM\/MH\/H \n4900- M\/MH I \nI Q H I M\/MH MH\/H M\/MH \n3600- I l \nMN \n2500- \nQJLP I \n100-  \noo ~ 2'o 3~ ,~ 5~ 80 \n40000 l\n32400 \n25600 \n19600 1 \n14400 \n10000\" \n6400- \n3600\" \n1600, \n400\" \n0.0 \nR Q \n!

Thermomagnet ic  curve  fo r  Exmoor  cambiso l .  \nnetic enhancement often shows little correlation \nwith other soil parameters, with the exception of \nsome positive correlation with soil organic carbon \nand cation exchange capacity. The minerals formed \nby enhancement are magnetite and, by subsequent \noxidation, maghemite. Maghemite is thus a \ncommon component of enhanced soils; it is not \nformed directly, but as an alteration product of \nthe original mixed Fe 2 +\/Fe 3 + spinel, magnetite. \nOxidation of the smallest magnetite grains to \nmaghemite may promote their subsequent survival \nin the soil. Ultrafine magnetite may be dissolved \neven in non-reducing conditions, due to its struc- \ntural Fe 2\u00f7 content; in contrast, the Fe B+ oxides \nrequire reduction for their dissolution (Taylor, \npers. commun.). This may explain the observed \nlink between susceptibility enhancement and a \nseasonally wet\/dry climate regime (Tite and \nLinington, 1975), with magnetite formation during \nperiods of intermittent soil wetness and its oxida- \ntion to maghemite in subsequent dry periods. \nA large proportion of the susceptibility increases \nseen in enhanced soils is due to the superparamag- \nnetic grain size of the authigenic magnetite and \nmaghemite. These empirical observations how \ninteresting correlation with laboratory experiments \non magnetite synthesis, where slow oxidation of \nan Fe 2+ system at near-neutral pH resulted in \nrapid formation of ultrafine magnetite (Taylor \net al., 1987). \nIn contrast, rates of magnetic depletion (i.e., \nfrom loss of iron and\/or conversion to non-ferri- \n48 B.A. Maher \/ Pahwo,~,eography, Palaeoclimatology, Pakwoecolo<r 137 g1998) 25 54 \nmagnetic forms) seem to be highest in permanently \nwet soils, very acidic podsols and in areas where \nrainfall exceeds ~2000 mm p.a. From these data, \nsignificant enhancement would be predicted for \nbrunisol-type soils undergoing wetting\/drying \ncycles on buffered Fe-bearing parent materials, \nsuch as occur on the Cretaceous chalk in the U.K. \nor on the carbonate-rich loess of China. \nThese observations appear contradictory to the \ngenerally held view that pedogenic formation of \niron oxides is extremely slow in well drained calcar- \neous soils, because of slow rates of dissolution of \nparent, Fe2-containing minerals in equilibrium \nwith CaCO 3 (e.g., Loeppert, 1988). However, as \nnoted by Loeppert (op. cit.), rates of Fe release \nwithin such soils may be greatly increased in micro- \nsites of active microbial metabolism. Just as the \nsupply of Fe can be controlled by bacterial activity, \nso the precipitation product of Fe 2+ oxidation \nappears to be similarly controlled. In the case of \nmagnetite formation by magnetotactic bacteria, \nthese organisms require the presence of nitrate in \nmicro-aerophilic onditions (Blakemore et al., \n1985). Such conditions would be expected in A \nhorizons but not in deeper soil horizons \n(Fassbinder and Stanjek, 1993 ). For dissimilatory \nmagnetite production by Fe3+-reducing bacteria, \nFe 2+ production will occur upon (temporary) wet- \nting of parts of the soil and subsequent respiratory \ndepletion of oxygen. The correlation between mag- \nnetic content and organic matter suggests efficient \nFe 3 + reduction and magnetite formation, given an \nadequate supply of oxidisable organic matter. \nFischer (1988) notes that the percentage of \nFe3+-reducing bacteria is often at a maximum in \nthe lower part of Ah horizons, where enough \norganic matter exists but where supply of oxygen \nis lowered due to the higher soil water content. \nEven in lower horizons, sufficient organic matter \nexists to support significant numbers of \nFe-reducing bacteria; Ottow (1969) reported their \npresence ven at 1 m soil depth. The presence of \npedogenic magnetite, of very variable grain size, \nin the A and B horizons of the enhanced soils \ninvestigated here, suggests that the extracellular, \nBIM pathway is more significant than the intracel- \nlular, BOM pathway for pedogenic magnetite \nformation. \n5. Significance for paleoclimate reconstructions \nfrom paleosols \nIt is clear that the magnetic properties of modern \nsoils are sensitive indicators of soil-forming pro- \ncesses and directions. The relationship between \nsoil magnetic properties and ambient climate must \nbe evaluated within the context of other soil- \nforming factors, which include slope, parent mate- \nrial, organic activity and time. As shown here, \neven where soils have developed on the same \nsubstrate, over the same timescale, great differences \nin magnetic properties can result over short dis- \ntances due to changing relief and (soil) climate. \nThese observations, however, serve to emphasise \nthe unique nature of the Quaternary record held \nby the paleosol sequences of the Chinese loess \nplateau. Here, between-site variability in pedogenic \nfactors is reduced to an unparalleled minimum \n(Maher et al., 1994). The parent material is a \nrapidly weathering, porous, iron-bearing medium \nof exceptionally uniform composition. Topography \nis insignificant, with the loess and paleosol units \nstretching horizontally across hundreds of kilome- \ntres of the region. Vegetation can be assumed to \nco-vary with climate. Thus, the soil system equa- \ntion (Jenny, 1941) can be reduced in this unique \nregion to a function of climate and time (Maher \net al., 1994). On the basis of the modern soil data, \nand the oxic. well drained, near-neutral pH charac- \nteristics of the Chinese loess, efficient pedogenic \nenhancement of susceptibility would be expected \nthroughout past interstadial nd interglacial cycles. \nConversely, Kletetschka nd Banmjee (1995) sug- \ngest fire has played a key role in magnetic enhance- \nment of the Chinese paleosols. As shown here, \nsoils can become magnetically enhanced without \nbeing burnt. It would also be difficult to produce \nthe even and gradational distribution of soil sus- \nceptibility values seen across the Loess Plateau by \nfiring, which tends to cause efficient enhancement \nin localised zones (e.g., Maher, 1986). \nIf the enhancement of the Chinese paleosols is \nassumed to be pedogenic in origin, the paleo- \nsusceptibility variations may be used to reconstruct \npaleoclimate in the following way. First, it is \nnecessary to identify the relative roles of climate \nand time. For susceptibility to reflect individual \nB.A. Maher \/ Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatolog), Palaeoecology 137 (1998) 25-54 49 \nQuaternary climate stages, it needs to be a rapidly \ndeveloping soil property, reaching near steady- \nstate with regard to ambient climate in no more \nthan a few thousand years. A continually develop- \ning soil property, reaching a maximum only over \na timespan of thousands to millions of years, may \npredominantly reflect the duration of soil forma- \ntion. Identification of the relative roles of time and \nclimate in soil magnetic enhancement is problem- \natic. For example, Woodward et al. (1994) report \nsusceptibility values for a sequence of Quaternary \nprofiles developed in alluvial terrace sediments in \nnorthwest Greece. The youngest soil (< 30 yr B.P.) \nshows no magnetic enhancement. Three profiles, \none of late Holocene age (~1000yrB.P. ) ,  the \nothers of late Pleistocene age (~ 20-28,000 yr B.P.), \nshow similar levels of enhancement in their B \nhorizons (20 40 cm depth). The deepest soil pro- \nfile, assumed to be the oldest in the sequence, has \nthe highest enhancement. These authors suggest \nthe magnetic data thus demonstrate time depen- \ndence, but the question of climate versus time is \nin fact unresolved. Three of the four soils, spanning \nan age range of 1000 28,000 yr B.P., display sim- \nilar magnetic values. The profile assumed to be \noldest does have the highest enhancement but is \nthis due to its longer soil-forming duration, or \ndoes it reflect an earlier and different soil-forming \nclimate? Similarly, 'chronofunctions' of pedogenic \nsusceptibility over periods of up to I million years \n(Singer et al., 1992) may not be true chronofunc- \ntions because climate will also certainly have \nchanged over this timescale. \nTo identify rates of magnetic enhancement, good \nage control is required, together with a dense \nspectrum of soils spanning the established times- \ncale. So far, only circumstantial evidence xists to \nsuggest rapid enhancement of susceptibility in \n'suitable' soils. Maher et al. (1994) show that \nsusceptibility values of recent soils in the Loess \nPlateau area of China are within the same range \nas the paleosols, some of which have had longer \nsoil-forming durations. Also, strong correlation \nexists between the pedogenic susceptibility of the \nyoung soils and present-day rainfall (Maher et al., \n1994; Han et al., 1996). Maher and Thompson \n(1995) compiled susceptibility and rainfall data \nfor a number of northern hemisphere temperate \nzone sites, and also found good correlation \nbetween pedogenic susceptibility and rainfall \n(Fig. 18). Such a relationship would not be \nexpected if soil-forming duration was a more domi- \nnant factor than climate. Other indications of \nrapid rates of soil enhancement include the annu- \nall), increasing soil susceptibility at a reclaimed \nmine site in the Northern Territories of Australia, \nwhere no fires have occurred (Milnes, pers. \ncommun.). Similarly, Johnson (pers. commun.) \nreports localised soil magnetic enhancement, \nresulting from a farmer's construction of a subsoil \ndrainage ditch, lined with branches. Enhancement \nhas occurred over just 50 years as the wood lining \nhas decomposed. \nIt is likely that when Fe-reducing bacteria have \naccess to organic matter and a weathering source \nof reactive (e.g. poorly crystalline) iron, they will, \nupon activation by the onset of locally anoxic \nconditions, induce enhancement. Maximum \nenhancement may occur in the profile where: (1) \norganic matter is available (for bacterial metabo- \nlism and also retardation of crystallisation of Fe \nto, e.g., hematite); and (2) oxygen levels are locally \nand temporarily decreased, so that the Fe-reducing \nbacteria re favoured. Following the initially rapid \nrise in susceptibility, a near steady-state value may \nevolve for that ambient (soil) climate, due to \ncompetitive quilibrium between: (1) formation \nand persistence of the pedogenic ferrimagnets; and \n(2) oxidation to weakly magnetic oxides like goe- \nthite or hematite. Thus, intermittent wetting and \ndrying of soils favours magnetite formation and \nFe3+-oxide dissolution, whilst drying favours \nFe3+-oxide formation at the expense of the neo- \nformed ultrafine magnetites. Without this competi- \ntive feedback, magnetically enhancing soils would \ncontinue to enhance through time, as long as iron \nand organic matter were available. Susceptibility \nvalues would therefore show time dependence \n(Singer et al., 1992), rather than climate depen- \ndence (Maher and Thompson, 1995). \nAs soil profiles continue to weather and deepen, \nit is likely that the cumulative susceptibility will \nincrease through time, whilst the maximum pedo- \ngenic susceptibility value may maintain a climati- \ncally determined equilibrium. Paleorainfall \nreconstructions from the Chinese loess sequences \nhave yet to take into account the profile- and \ndepth-distribution of pedogenic susceptibility. \n50 B.A. Maher .'

Pedogenic magnetic susceptibility versus rainfall I'o1 a range of Northern hemisphere sites in the temperate zone (from Maher \nand Thompson, 1995): (a) a linear plot of susceptibility and rainfidl; (b) a log linear plot of susceptibility and rainfall: (c) the \ngeographic distribution of the sites providing the data in (a) and (b): (d) a linear plot of the C horizon and B horizon susceptibility \nvalues, the lack of correlation indicating lack of influence of parent material on the degree of pedogenic enhancement. \nProblems also remain in determining sufficiently \naccurately the rate of dust inputs during pedogene- \nsis, and hence their significance for rates of pedo- \ngenic enhancement. Calculated accumulation rates \nfor the paleosols may be significantly overesti- \nmated, given that the soils are not  essentially a \ndeposit but are superimposed on the previously \ndeposited glacial loess. Improved time control is \nrequired, which may then significantly add to the \nvalue of multi-factorial modelling approaches, as \ndescribed by Anderson and Hallet (1996). \nHowever, it is possible that the loess and paleosol \nunits remain within the weathering zone (within \nl m of the ground surface) for approximately \nequivalent periods of time ( ~ 10 ka), constrained, \nrespectively, by burial rates during glacial periods \nand by the duration of interglacial periods. For \nexample, given a loess accumulation rate of \n10cm\/ka during a glacial period, the residence \ntime of that loess within the weathering zone will \nbe ~ 10 ka. Given an accumulation rate of 4 cm\/ka \nduring an interglacial period, the residence time \nfor weathering will potentially be much longer \n(~25 ka) but most interglacial periods do not \npersist beyond 10 ka. Thus, there may be con- \nvergence and relative constancy between the \nweathering durations of both loess sedimentary \npackets and paleosols. \nIt is clear from the modern soils that a rainfall- \nspecific enhancement signal will not  be seen in soils \nprone to net loss or reduction of iron, such as \npodsols, gleysols and soils subjected to excessive \nrainfall (> ~ 2000 ram). If any of the Chinese paleo- \nsols have been subjected to such high rainfall, their \npedogenic susceptibility values may appear anoma- \nlously low as a result. Deserts, either cold or warm, \nB.A. Maher \/ Palaeogeography, Palaeocl#natology, Palaeoecology 137 (1998) 25 54 51 \nwould also be expected to form soils with \nlow concentrations of pedogenic ferrimagnets. \nSchwertmann etal. (1982) point out that excessively \ndrained soils may preferentially accumulate hema- \ntite, even in temperate climates, due to their \nenhanced aridity and oxidation, relative to adjacent \nfiner textured soils. In this context, it is interesting \nto note the complete absence of pedogenic magne- \ntite in the Valley Farm paleosol, a rubified paleosol \ndeveloped in sands and gravels of early Pleistocene \nage, in the East Anglian region of the UK. \nPedogenic enhancement of susceptibility may \nalso be difficult to identify in soils dominated by \naeolian and weathering inputs of detrital magnetic \nparticles. Superimposed on any pedogenic on- \ntrols, aeolian input of detrital magnetic particles \nmay be amplified under conditions of local aridity \nand increased wind intensity (Beget et al., 1990). \nConversely, aeolian supply of sand and silt-sized \ndetrital grains is likely to be reduced given more \nhumid conditions, increased ground vegetation \ncover and decreased wind speeds. Under such \nconditions, aeolian inputs may be restricted \nto finer, relatively low-susceptibility, particles. \nSusceptibility values may also change if the source \nof the aeolian supply itself varies. In such situa- \ntions, the susceptibility signal may show lower \nvalues in the soils than in the unweathered loess, \nas in the Alaskan sequences (Beget et al., 1990), \nand those in Poland (Nawrocki et al., 1995) and \nSiberia (Rutter and Chlachula, 1995). The latter \nauthors report evidence for pedogenic formation \nof ultrafine magnetic grains in some of the Siberian \nand Polish paleosols (e.g., as shown by measurable \nvalues of frequency-dependent susceptibility), but \nnet magnetic depletion is apparent in the gleyed \ninterglacial soils and even in the brunisols. From \nthe modern data, magnetite formation would be \npredicted for the brunisols, unless the climate was \neither too dry (<~350mmp.a . )  or too wet \n(> ~ 2000 mm p.a.) for enhancement to proceed. \n6. Conclusions \nFrom the above the following conclusions can \nbe drawn: \n(1) Measured variations in magnetic susceptibil- \nity values of loess\/paleosol sequences may arise \nfrom a variety of site-specific sources, including \nchanges in allochthonous and authigenic magnetic \ninputs. \n(2) Allochthonous magnetic inputs to soils can \nvary by source, rate of input and grain size; in \npaleosols, such variations may reflect past changes \nin wind speed, direction and aridity. \n(3) Authigenic magnetic inputs vary with the \nrelative rates of magnetic depletion (loss of iron \nand\/or conversion of iron to non-ferrimagnetic \nforms) and magnetic enhancement, which are sen- \nsitive to soil type, especially with regard to oppor- \ntunities for iron reduction\/oxidation cycles. \nExcessively arid, wet or acidic soils display little \nmagnetic enhancement; intermittently wet\/dry soils \nshow most enhancement. \n(4) For those soils which are liable to be magnet- \nically enhanced (as above), correlation has been \nfound between the maximum value of pedogenic \nsusceptibility and the annual rainfall. The almost \nunique pedogenic system in the Chinese loess area, \nwhere variation in soil-forming factors other than \nclimate is reduced to a global minimum, allows \nuse of the paleo-susceptibility values as proxy \npaleorainfall values. Annual rainfall may be an \ninsensitive measure of soil moisture (Derbyshire \net al., 1995), and degree of pedogenesis may, in \nturn, not be a simple function of rainfall, but the \nstrength of the rainfall\/susceptibility correlation \nsuggests it may validly be used as a means of \nproxy paleorainfall reconstruction i  this region. \n(5) To identify the mechanism and source of any \nlink between magnetic properties, for example, sus- \nceptibility and climate change, the mineralogy and \ngrain size of soil magnetic arriers require detailed \ninvestigation. Broecker (1992) has stated that indi- \ncators of paleorainfall are at best qualitative. Given: \n(a) the prospect of quantitative reconstruction of \npast rainfall rates from continental loess records; \n(b) predicted future climate changes; and (c) the \nvalue of paleoclimate data for testing of General \nCirculation Models, such detailed magnetic investi- \ngations constitute an important scientific task. \nAcknowledgements \nThe XRD analyses were carried out at the \nInstitute for Food Research, Norwich, and the \nM6ssbauer analysis at the Institute for Rock \nMagnetism, University of Minnesota. \n52 B.A. Maher : Pa&eogeogreq)hy, Palaeoc\/inlaloh)gy, PaNeoecologv 137 (1998) 25 54 \nAppend ix  A \nSoi l  Survey Sample  Set  \nProfile No. Sample No. Horizon Depth Subgroup Parent Material Series \n(cm) \nSK66\/0312 1 Ae 3 10 Humo-ferric podsol Bunter sandstone Shirrel Heath \n2 Ea 10-20 \n3 Bhs 25-29 \n4 Bs 27-50 \n5 Bc 57 90 \n6 Cu 110 140 \nSU06\/2008 7 Ap~ 0 13 Brown earth (gleyic) Glauconitic sandstone Urchfont \n( Upper Greensand) \nApe \nE(g)l \nE(g)2 \nSK90\/1304 Ap Ferritic brown earth Verruginous andstone Banbury \nBw \nBCt \nSS63\/2208 A Brown earth Devonian silt and mudstones Denbigh \nBw \nSK66\/3791 Ea Brown sand Bunter sandstone Howard \nEa \nBs \nB \nBt \nCu \nSK56\/6696 Ap Brown sand Triassic sandstone Cuckney \nBWz \nBw2 \nBcl \nBc 2 \nSS63\/9482 Ap Brown podsolic Devonian slates Manod \nBs \nSO74\/4308 Brown earth Silurian siltstone Barton \nSK78\/6175 Ap Argillic pelosol Red clay Worcester \nBt \nBc \nCr \nTM12\/8729 Ap Stagnogleyic pelosol London clay (pyritic) Airborne \nB(g) \nCg \nSW71\/4166 Bw Brown earth Serpentine Black Head \nSS74\/6513 Oh Stagnopodsol Slate Hafren \nAh \nEag \nBsg \nBs \nSO95\/8928 Bwg Calcareous pelosol Calcareous clay Evesham \nBG \nSO74\/3456 Brown earth Devonian sandstone and marl Eardiston \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \nA \nB \nB\/C \n13- 38 \n38- 42 \n62 86 \n0 31 \n31-52 \n80 95 \n3 20 \n25-50 \n24  \n5 20 \n25-45 \n40 57 \n60  80 \n135 145 \n0 26 \n26-52 \n52-80 \n82 1 O0 \n100 150 \n0 23 \n27-42 \n0 2O \n20 62 \n62 76 \n0 30 \n30 5(1 \n50-80 \n95-150 \n0 29 \n29 65 \n65- \n21 45 \n0 4 \n4 10 \nI 0 20 \n21-28 \n28 71 \n19 46 \n46 80 \n80 I l0 \nO 22 \n22 35 \n35 48 \nB.A. Maher \/ Palueogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 137 (1998) 25- 54 53 \nReferences  \nAnderson, R.S., Hallet, B., 1996.
