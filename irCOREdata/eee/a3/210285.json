The costs of eradication, managerial\nimpediments to executing national control programmes, and scientific uncertainty about transmission endpoints, are\nchallenges to the success of this effort, especially in areas of high endemicity where financial resources are limited. We used\na combined analysis of empirical community data describing the association between infection and chronic disease\nprevalence, mathematical modelling, and economic analyses to identify and evaluate the feasibility of setting an infection\ntarget level at which the chronic pathology attributable to lymphatic filariasis - lymphoedema of the extremities and\nhydroceles - becomes negligible in the face of continuing transmission as a first stage option in achieving the elimination of\nthis parasitic disease. The results show that microfilaria prevalences below a threshold of 3.55% at a blood sampling volume\nof 1 ml could constitute readily achievable and sustainable targets to control lymphatic filarial disease. They also show that\nas a result of the high marginal cost of curing the last few individuals to achieve elimination, maximal benefits can occur at\nthis threshold. Indeed, a key finding from our coupled economic and epidemiological analysis is that when initial\nuncertainty regarding eradication occurs and prospects for resolving this uncertainty over time exist, it is economically\nbeneficial to adopt a flexible, sequential, eradication strategy based on controlling chronic disease initially.\nCitation: Michael E, Malecela MN, Zervos M, Kazura JW (2008) Global Eradication of Lymphatic Filariasis: The Value of Chronic Disease Control in Parasite\nElimination Programmes.

This optimality, as for any parasite\ncontrol programme, can be tempered, however, by the technical\nchallenge of maintaining adequate population coverage with\nMDA necessary to achieve cessation of transmission within the\ncurrently mooted period of 4 to 6 years and the financial burden of\ncontinuing intervention programmes that target the last few\ncommunities and individuals necessary to meet criteria considered\nto be indicative of eradication [3]. Moreover, achieving parasite\neradication implies the need for sustaining control programmes in\norder to continue surveillance for residual infections beyond 4 to 6\nyears [4]. Current scientific understanding of LF eradication is also\nhampered by imperfect knowledge regarding parasite transmission\ndynamics and endpoint targets [5].\nRecent work has also clarified the economic behaviour of\ninvestments in parasite eradication [3,6,7]. A key notion regarding\nthe desirability of undertaking parasite eradication from this\nperspective is that incurring immediate costs is expected to yield\nhigh future long-term benefits. An important caveat of these\nappraisals is that most of this work has assumed the technical\nfeasibility of eradication with little focus given so far to the role of\npayoff uncertainty on the choice of optimal strategies. These gaps\nin analysis are particularly significant when considering work\ncarried out in the field of ecological and strategic management,\nwhich shows that when longer-term investment outcomes are\nuncertain, it may be optimal to identify and implement effective\nstrategies over the short term, which can be adapted flexibly to\nachieve investment goals as information regarding the attainability\nof desired outcomes improves in time [8,9\u201311].\nThese considerations suggest that in certain geographical\nregions, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and other areas where\nLF endemicity is high and budgetary and capacity constraints\napply, it may be desirable to adopt flexible strategies that first\nreduce infection to levels that prevent the occurrence of LF disease\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 8 | e2936\nmanifestations even though a steady state, low level of transmission\npersists. Although it is not yet known whether such a strategy\nwould be successful, empirical observations from some MDA trials\nhave shown that the prevalence of the major chronic disease\nmanifestations of LF, lymphoedema of the extremities and\nhydrocele, can be decreased without reducing transmission levels\nto zero [12,13]. Here, we combine epidemiological analyses of\nobserved data describing the relationship between the overall\nprevalence of chronic bancroftian filarial disease and microfilarial\n(mf) infection with mathematical model predictions of filariasis\nreinfection and economic analysis of MDA interventions, to\nestimate and clarify the value of using a threshold infection level\nbelow which LF-induced pathology becomes negligible as a first\nstage option in the successful eradication of filariasis.\nMethods\n(a) Data Sources\nField study data (see Table S1 online) on the association\nbetween the prevalence of Wuchereria bancrofti mf infection and\ncombined lymphoedema and hydrocele disease rates in filarial\nendemic communities were extracted from the published literature\nfor each of the major endemic regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia\nother than India, India, Latin America and the Pacific. Although\nthis yielded data from 94 separate communities, perusal of the\ndata showed that adequate data covering the full range of infection\nprevalence, especially at lower mf prevalence values, existed only\nfor Sub-Saharan Africa and India. Our analysis in this study was\ntherefore by necessity limited to these data compiled from a total\nof 76 separate communities from these two regions. Prior to\nanalysis, all mf prevalence values were standardized to reflect\nsampling of 1 ml blood volumes using a transformation factor of\n1.95 and 1.15 respectively for values originally estimated using\n20 ml or 100 ml blood volumes. These factors were derived using\ncomparative prevalence data from the parallel application of these\ndifferent diagnostic methods on the same individuals [14\u201318], and\nthe function, fp~\nP\n1\nML\nP\n1\n20 or 100\n, where P*ML is the mean mf prevalence\nobtained using the 1 ml blood filtration method and P*20 and P\n*\n100\ndenote the mf prevalences obtained using 20 ul and 100 ul blood\nvolumes [5].\n(b) Statistical Analysis\nThe association of mf infection with chronic LF disease is described\nand the existence of a threshold in the relationship was examined via\nfitting of the following hierarchical logistic dose-response regression\nmodels with and without the specification of a threshold parameter to\nthe assembled data [19\u201321]. Model 1 represents the nonthreshold\nmodel and is the familiar basic logistic regression model with an\nintercept relating the prevalence of chronic LF disease to observed\ncommunity mf prevalence values given by the equation:\nlog\np\n1{p\n\u0001 \u0002\n~azbx \u00f01\u00de\nThe threshold mf prevalence level (t) at which parasitic infection\nbegins to contribute significantly to the development of chronic\nfilarial disease is then estimated by fitting the corresponding logistic\ndose-response model which incorporates the threshold parameter as\ndepicted by the equation:\nlog\np\n1{p\n\u0001 \u0002\n~\na\nazb1 x{t\u00f0 \u00de\n\u0003 \u0004\nfor\nx\u0192t\nxwt\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere p in both models is the probability of the occurrence of\ncombined lymphoedema and hydrocele in the community, t is the\nthreshold value of the risk factor, x (i.e. mf prevalence), a defines the\nbaseline morbidity prevalence due to non-filarial causes of disease,\nand b and b1 describe the degree of association between infection and\ndisease with and without the threshold. Model 2 assumes that the risk\nof chronic disease is constant below the threshold t and increases\naccording to the logistic equation above t. Given prevalence data, we\nfitted the models assuming binomial errors and obtained parameter\nestimates for the data by essentially maximizing the log-likelihood\nfunction [22]:\nX\ni\nyi:log piz ni{yi\u00f0 \u00de:log 1{pi\u00f0 \u00de \u00f03\u00de\nwhere yi is the observed disease cases in each community and pi is\nthe predicted prevalence of disease obtained from equations 1 and\n2 respectively, given prevalence of infection, x, and ni is the sample\nsize used for assessing disease from each study. We used the gnlr\nfunction in the R software programme, which fits nonlinear\nregression equations to data for various common one and two\nparameter error distributions, including the binomial distribution,\nby minimizing the 2log-likelihood via the Newton-Raphson\niterative method, to fit both models in this study (see details in\n[23]). The hypothesis that the threshold model fits the relationship\nbetween community mf prevalence and LF disease prevalence\nbetter than the nonthreshold model is assessed by comparing the\n2log likelihood values of each model. The null hypothesis is H0:\nt=0 and the alternate hypothesis is H1: t.0. The test statistic is\nthe likelihood ratio statistic: LR=22(ln L(H0)2ln L(H1)), where\nL(H0) is the 2log likelihood value of the model without a\nthreshold (model 1) and L(H1) is the 2log likelihood value of the\nmodel with the threshold level (model 2). The null hypothesis is\nrejected if the statistic, LR, is greater than 3.84 (critical value,\na=0.05). Note that although data from two of the major endemic\nregions are used, we were able to fit the models to all the available\ndata and hence, effectively estimate the global threshold value for\nthe association between mf prevalence and LF chronic disease for\nthe overall data. Our efforts at fitting the threshold models used in\nthis study to the data when stratified by endemic regions failed to\nconverge, most certainly due to the paucity of such data and\nespecially the restricted ranges of x-values (mf prevalences)\nobserved for the available studies at the regional level. As in the\ncase of estimating transmission endpoints [5], this result highlights\nthe need for generating standardized regional data over the full\nrange observed in the field (but especially over the lower mf\nprevalence range) if these more pertinent regional figures are to be\nreliably estimated.\n(c) Modelling the impact of MDA interventions\nInvestigation of the impact of using the estimated mf prevalence\nthreshold for filarial disease as an intervention endpoint in MDA\nprogrammes was carried out by simulation using EPIFIL, a\ndeterministic model for LF transmission [5,24,25]. Simulations\npredicting annual changes in overall community mf prevalence\nfollowing a 5-year intervention programme with either of the two\nmajor MDA regimens (viz. annual single dose diethylcarbamazine\nin combination with albendazole (DEC\/ALB) or ivermectin in\ncombination with albendazole (IVM\/ALB)) with the assumption\nof a pre-control mf prevalence of 10% were compared for\ntreatment coverages of 65%, 80% and 95%. Drug efficacy values\nused in the simulations were: DEC\/ALB \u2013 55% worm kill, 95%\nmf cured and 6 months mf suppression; IVM\/ALB \u2013 35% worm\nkill, 99% mf cured and 9 months mf suppression [25].\nFilariasis Eradication\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 August 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 8 | e2936\n(d) Marginal cost-effectiveness analysis\nThis was performed by combining model predictions of the\ndynamic impact of an annual IVM\/ALB MDA programme given\nat 80% coverage in curing individuals of mf with the costs of\ncarrying out this MDA programme. The major objective of this\nanalysis was to determine and evaluate the marginal costs of\ncuring additional individuals to achieve parasite elimination and\neradication of transmission compared to achieving disease control\nin a major endemic country. We illustrate the results by basing the\nanalysis on the real life situation in Tanzania, where the endemic\npre-control LF infection level has been estimated to be around\n11.95% mf prevalence [26]. The analysis assumed that the entire\ncurrent population of Tanzania above 5 years is at risk and so eligible\nfor treatment (corresponding to 28.79 million as estimated in 2002\n[27]). Model predictions of the impact of the annual IVM\/ALB\nMDA given at 80% coverage for a baseline mf prevalence of 11.95%\nwere used in the calculations of the mean number of individuals\ncured during the MDA programme, with the assumption that LF is\neliminated when mean mf prevalence is reduced to,0.5% [5]. Two\ntypes of programme costs were estimated and compared. First, the\ntotal programme cost accounting for all resources (including drug\nand programme delivery costs) used in carrying out an annual MDA,\nwhich was conservatively assumed to be around $0.70 for treating\none individual [28,29]. Second, government costs, defined as the\nfinancial costs of all inputs paid for directly by the Ministry of Health\nexcluding any donations to the programme such as donated drugs.\nWe estimated this cost to be around $0.53 per treated individual\nusing the estimates given in Ramzy and colleagues [29]. The former\napproach is useful in assessing the allocation of programme resources\nand their opportunity costs, i.e. determining whether these resources\ncould be used more productively elsewhere, whereas the latter cost\nestimates are helpful to national planners in assessing programme\naffordability. Numbers of individuals cured and all costs were\ndiscounted at 6% [28].\n(e) Modelling the cost of sequential-decision approaches\nbased on chronic disease control\nWe evaluated the strategic value of implementing a sequential\ndecision approach to LF eradication in which chronic disease\ncontrol is first achieved followed by additional MDAs to achieve\nparasite eradication when information regarding the feasibility of\neradication improves over time, by undertaking a scenario-based\nanalysis of the comparative costs of a programme aimed from the\nbeginning solely at eradication versus a two-staged strategy based\ninitially on disease control as follows. The analysis was based on\nEPIFIL predictions of the number of annual MDAs required to\nmeet the endpoints of these scenarios given the baseline endemic\nmf infection prevalence level of 11.95% estimated for Tanzania\nand a drug coverage level of 80%.\nFirst, we considered the cost of the base strategy in which we are\ncertain that parasite eradication can be achieved in 10 years. The\nexpected present cost (EPC) of this strategy is given by:\nEPC1~C1z\nX10\nt~2\nCt\n1zr\u00f0 \u00det{1 \u00f04\u00de\nwhere C1 is the estimated cost of MDA in year 1 (calculated at a\nper capita cost of $0.70 per person (see above)), Ct denotes the cost\nof MDA for each of the years 2 to 10, and r represents the discount\nrate (6% as above).\nIn scenario two, we assume that information regarding the\nfeasibility of eradication becomes clear only some time in the\nfuture, say in year 5 following repeated annual MDAs (i.e. at the\ndisease control threshold) when we will either know with a high\nprobability, p = 0.90, that eradication is possible by year 10 in\nwhich case we will continue with 5 more annual MDAs to achieve\neradication or we will know with a probability 12p=0.10 that\neradication is not achievable with the current knowledge and\/or\ntechnology. At this point, we may abandon the goal of eradication\nand switch to long-term control, i.e implement treatment every 10\nyears (calculations shown here for at least up to 35 years), thus\nallowing flexibility to wait for further information to resolve\nuncertainty to aide making the choice that maximizes the value\nand minimizes loss from the MDA programme (as a result of\nreinfection to baseline levels if eradication is not achieved).\nIn scenario 3, we model a situation similar to scenario 2, but\ninstead of considering that eradication is never possible, we\nconsider that uncertainty in present knowledge and technology is\nlikely to be resolved by years 10 and 15 post initial MDA, when\nthe probability of eradication will occur at p = 0.90, and\neradication then given model predictions is expected to be possible\nwith an extra three years of annual MDA following disease control\nwith 5 annual MDAs initially.\nThe EPC of scenario two is hence given by:\nEPC2~C1z\nX5\nt~2\nCt\n1zr\u00f0 \u00det{1zp\nX10\nt~6\nCt\n1zr\u00f0 \u00det{1z\n1{p\u00f0 \u00de\nX\nt~15,25,35\nCt\n1zr\u00f0 \u00det{1\n\u00f05\u00de\nwhere C1, Ct and r are described as above and p denotes the\nprobability that eradication is possible (p = 0.90).\nFor scenario three, in which disease control is followed by the\nswitch to eradication when information regarding the feasibility of\neradication becomes better known either in year 10 or year 15, the\nEPC for the year 10 case is given by:\nEPC3a~C1z\nX5\nt~2\nCt\n1zr\u00f0 \u00det{1zp\nX10\nt~6\nCt\n1zr\u00f0 \u00det{1z\n1{p\u00f0 \u00de\nX13\nt~10\nCt\n1zr\u00f0 \u00det{1\n\u00f06\u00de\nand for the year 15 case by:\nEPC3b~C1z\nX5\nt~2\nCt\n1zr\u00f0 \u00det{1zp\nX10\nt~6\nCt\n1zr\u00f0 \u00det{1z\n1{p\u00f0 \u00de\nX18\nt~15\nCt\n1zr\u00f0 \u00det{1\n\u00f07\u00de\nwith variables as described before.\nResults\nFigure 1 depicts the data collated from all relevant published\nstudies available from Sub-Saharan Africa and India on the\nassociation between the community prevalence of LF infection and\nthe corresponding prevalence of chronic disease (n=76). Despite\nthe presence of some between-region geographic variation, the\nscatterplot depicted in the figure shows that there is a global\noccurrence of an overall positive but non-linear association\nbetween chronic disease attributed to LF and mf infection, with\ndisease apparently constant up to a threshold mean mf prevalence\nlevel and then increasing positively. Such a disease-infection\nFilariasis Eradication\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 August 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 8 | e2936\npattern, shown here for the first time for LF, suggests the operation\nof an infection dose response function whereby in communities\nwith low mf prevalence the observed disease may be due to causes\nother than filariasis while disease attributable to filarial infection\ndevelops only above a specific mf threshold [22]. Table 1 shows\nthe results of the statistical fits of models 1 and 2 to the data, and\nsupports the visual impression from figure 1 of the existence of an\n\u2018\u2018average\u2019\u2019 mf threshold in the development of LF chronic disease\nin the present data. The curve in the figure portrays the\npredictions of the logistic regression-based dose response model\nincorporating a threshold (model 2), and indicates that the pattern\nillustrated by the data for the occurrence of a threshold dependent\ndose-response in the association between LF infection and disease\nis adequately described by this model (see Text S1 and Figure S1\nonline for details of goodness of fit of the model). This result\nindicates that a threshold mf prevalence value that could be used\nas a target for suppressing formation of filarial disease may lie in\nthe region of 3.55% (95% confidence limits: 2.35\u20134.75) at the 1 ml\nblood sampling volume scale, with the caveat that there could be\nregional differences in the value of this threshold among endemic\ncommunities based on the peculiar features of local mosquito-\nvector parasite interactions. The results also indicate that on\naverage up to 1.07% of the observed lymphoedema and hydrocele\ncases may be non-filarial in aetiology [30].\nFigure 2A shows how predictions of a mathematical model of\nfilariasis transmission [24,25,31] allow an examination of the\nusefulness of implementing a 5-year MDA strategy with DEC\/\nALB or IVM\/ALB that has as its target either parasite elimination\nand eradication (set to be around 0.5% mf prevalence here [5]) or\ndisease control (3.55% mf prevalence). The simulations in the\nfigure are all based on a moderately high overall community pre-\ncontrol mf prevalence of 10% (at the scale of 1 ml blood sampling\nvolume), and for each treatment regimen are illustrated for\ncoverage values of 65%, 80% and 95% (portrayed by curves going\nfrom bottom to top respectively for each drug regimen). The\nresults indicate that while neither MDA regimen achieved the\nparasite elimination target for all the three treatment coverages\nconsidered, both achieved the disease control target of 3.55% mf\nprevalence before 5 years. This was true even in the case of the less\neffective IVM\/ALB regimen given at the lowest MDA coverage of\n65%. An additional feature of the results is that following the end\nof the treatment programme, the rates of rebound of infection\n(given that transmission has not been interrupted) are also\npredicted to be slow. For the IVM\/ALB regimen with only 65%\npopulation coverage, infection levels reduced to ,2.35% are\npredicted to remain under the disease control threshold for at least\n7 years after cessation of the 5-year intervention programme. At\nhigher coverages, and for the more effective DEC\/ALB regimen,\ninfection levels remained below the threshold level for more than\n10 years (Fig. 2A).\nThis effect of the achieved post-control mf prevalence following\nMDA on the rate of return of infection prevalence to pre-control\nequilibrium values is more clearly shown in Figure 2B, and\nindicates how this relationship can be used to guide the setting of\nthe mf prevalence target for long-term disease control. Thus, the\nnumerical projections in Figure 2B indicate that reducing mf\nprevalence to below 2.35% (i.e. below the lower 95% CL value of\nthe disease control threshold (Table 1)) may maintain infection\nlevels below the disease incidence threshold of 3.55% mf\nprevalence for up to as long as ,10 to 12 years before repeat\nMDAs will be required to depress infection again to sustain the\ncontrol of disease. This dynamical epidemiological result clearly\nmakes disease control both a feasible and sustainable option in\nendemic communities.\nTable 2 summarizes and compares the predicted average and\nmarginal costs of the annual IVM\/ALB MDA programme (80%\ncoverage) in curing individuals of mf to achieve LF elimination in\nTanzania. The results show that for both types of cost estimations\n(the total economic and the financial costs of programme delivery\nonly by the Ministry of Health), the average cost per individual\ncured of mf to achieve disease control will be moderately low\nwhereas the average and marginal cost of curing additional\nindividuals at each subsequent MDA round until transmission\nelimination is achieved will increase steeply. This is because, as the\nnumber of MDA rounds increase (an additional 5 years of MDA is\npredicted to be required to achieve transmission elimination as\ncompared to 5 years of MDA in total to achieve long-term disease\ncontrol, ie., by achieving mf prevalence reduction to 2.35%\nfollowing annual MDA (see above)), a progressively decreasing\nproportion of individuals are cured at the same fixed outlay for\nimplementing the annual mass treatment programme.

Because the number\nof MDA rounds required to achieve disease control is smaller than\nthat required to achieve transmission elimination (indeed, in\ngeneral this will take half the time required for parasite elimination\n(results not shown)), the marginal cost of achieving disease control\nwill also be considerably smaller compared to that for achieving\nparasite elimination. The analysis presented here used a very\nconservative cost of $0.70 in the case of the total economic cost\napproach and $0.53 in the case of the Government cost method to\ntreat one individual [28,29,32,33]; increasing this cost will only\nfurther amplify the present findings.\nIndeed, in cost-effectiveness terms, the declining number of\nadditional individuals cured as annual MDA proceeds compared to\nthe increasing marginal cost of curing these individuals from the\nadditional cycles of MDA suggests that maximal benefits may occur\nat less than 100% parasite control or parasite elimination. This is\nhighlighted in Figure 3, which graphically compares the expected\neffectiveness and costs of the annual MDA programme to eliminate\nLF in Tanzania. Figure 3 shows that the maximal cost-effectiveness\nof the programme could occur at 85% parasite control following 3\nannual MDAs. This is closer to the predicted 5 cycles of annual\nMDA required to achieve long-term disease control for this country\n(Table 2) in contrast to the 10 annual cycles needed to achieve\nparasite elimination or 100% parasite control, and further supports\nthe soundness of a disease control option as a first phase intermediate\nobjective in efforts to eradicate LF.\nThis incremental role of controlling disease first in LF eradication\nis reinforced by the estimates of the expected present costs (EPCs) of\nLF eradication strategies for the Republic of Tanzania with and\nwithout a flexible sequential-decision option based on exercising\ndisease control option, shown in Table 3. The number of years\nneeded to achieve LF disease control or\/and eradication were based\non EPIFIL model predictions as described in Methods, while\nsimilar treatment costs and discount rates as utilized in the marginal\ncost-effectiveness analysis were used in the analysis for comparative\npurposes. The results depict that the EPCs of strategies that contain\nthe flexibility of switching between disease control and eradication\nare lower than that of an eradication strategy in which no flexibility\nto either switch to disease control if eradication is not feasible or to\nembark upon eradication after disease control when eradication\nbecomes favourable exists. Since the EPCs of the flexible strategies\nare lower than that of the inflexible eradication strategy, it is clear\nthat such strategies should be preferable highlighting their optimality\nwhen uncertainty regarding eradication occurs. Indeed, the results\nshow that switching to long-term disease control from year 5 (MDAs\ngiven every 10 years following an initial 5 annual MDAs to achieve\ndisease control: Strategy 2) can be the cheapest intervention option\nfor LF if eradication can never be achieved (Table 3), while the lower\nEPCs of Strategies 3a & b compared to Strategy 1 highlight the costs\nwhich can be saved by waiting for better information regarding the\nfeasibility of eradication before switching to eradication from disease\ncontrol. The value of including such flexibilities in the LF eradication\nprogramme for the republic of Tanzania is given by option value\nfigures depicted in Table 3, and indicates that including flexible\ndecision-making based initially on disease control can yield savings of\nbetween US$ 3.3 to 5.0 million depending on the feasibility of\neradication (from never (Strategy 2) to waiting to switch to\neradication at different times when knowledge and technology\nimproves (Strategies 3a & 3b)).\nFigure 4 shows the relationship between the probability of\neradication (the lower this probability the higher the uncertainty\nregarding the feasibility of eradication) and the EPC values of\nStrategies 3a and 3b. The results show that as uncertainly\nregarding eradication increases the EPCs of these strategies will\nFigure 2.

For\nexample, when uncertainty regarding eradication is even moder-\nately high, say at the probability of eradication of only p= 0.70,\nthe costs saved (or option value of) employing Strategy 3a over the\ninflexible Strategy 1 can be as high as US$10.0 million and for\nStrategy 3b even higher at US$12.0 million. Note that because of\nthe effects of discounting, Strategy 3b will always be better value\nthan Strategy 3a as the extra costs related to switching to\neradication occurs 5 years later compared to the case with the\nlatter strategy (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nThis study set out to use a combined epidemiological and\neconomic approach in order to evaluate the possibility of estimating\nand setting an infection threshold that achieves control of LF-related\ndisease as a rational and feasible first stage target for LF eradication\nprogrammes. Our analyses show that not only may such a threshold\nexist but also that this endpoint is likely to be sustainable owing to the\nslow rebound of infection following MDA (principally as a result of\nthe long life span of the adult parasite [24]). The results also reveal\nthat a third epidemiological factor which may make an intervention\nstrategy aimed at controlling LF morbidity as an intermediate step\non the path to parasite eradication attractive to policy makers and\nhealth care planners in developing countries \u2013 namely that disease\ncontrol thresholds can generally be achieved in half the time required\nfor accomplishing transmission elimination. This is shown to be the\ncase even if the long-term disease control mf prevalence target is set\nto be lower (eg, 2.35%) than the infection threshold (3.55%) at which\ndisease develops in communities. From the perspective of national\nhealth agencies responsible for implementing and sustaining MDA\nprogrammes, this finding highlights the feasibility of achieving\ndisease control readily compared to transmission elimination,\nespecially when model predictions and available data [13,34\u201337]\nsuggest that even when high population coverage is achieved the\nduration of annual MDA necessary to stop transmission can be\nexpected to extend beyond 7 years in the many endemic areas where\nthe baseline mf prevalence is equal to or greater than 10% [5,25].\nNote that our estimate of the disease control threshold was\ntechnically made possible only via synthetic epidemiological\nanalysis based on using all the available published data from only\ntwo of the major LF endemic regions. Given the geographic\nvariation in the data used to construct Figure 1 and lack of\nadequate information within and across many other LF endemic\nareas, this estimated disease threshold could in reality vary\nbetween regions. However, as noted above, the paucity of regional\ndata describing the mf and disease prevalence relationship\nTable 2.

This conclusion, as highlighted also for the\nestimation of transmission endpoints in LF [5], signifies the need\nfor collecting more reliable standardized data spanning the natural\nrange of prevalences observed in the field at the regional level. In\nthe meanwhile, given that data from Sub-Saharan Africa were\nused in the estimation of the disease threshold value here, we\nsuggest that the present results for the Republic of Tanzania are\nunlikely to be severely influenced by this issue.\nThe economic analyses carried out in this study have yielded\ntwo major insights regarding the choice of optimal eradication\nstrategies for LF hitherto not fully recognized. First, marginal cost-\neffectiveness analysis has demonstrated that when epidemiological\nresults are combined with economic rationalities, disease control as\na first stage target is likely to be attractive to policy makers as a\nresult of the far higher marginal cost that arises from having to\ncure additional individuals in order to stop parasite transmission\ncompletely compared to controlling disease. Coupled with\nrelatively low cost social efforts that emphasize local hygiene to\nprevent and treat forms of chronic morbidity such as lymphoe-\ndema of the extremity [38], this important outcome suggests that\nthe decision to undertake parasite eradication must take explicit\naccount of the opportunity cost of eradication, especially when\nbudgetary and capacity constraints exist within the health systems\nexpected to implement and sustain mass intervention programmes.\nIndeed, our analysis shows that the relationship between the\nmarginal social benefits and costs of annual LF MDA is such that\nthe optimal level of parasite control may be closer to that achieved by\ndisease control compared to parasite elimination. This result is\ntempered by the technical feasibility of achieving parasite elimina-\ntion [3], but it does indicate that given the slow expected rebound of\ninfection when parasite transmission is reduced but not eliminated,\nhuman and financial resources that would otherwise be expended for\ncontinuation of MDA and infection surveillance during the period of\nlow reinfection could be spent more beneficially on economic and\nsocial development of target populations (better sanitation, improved\nhealth and educational facilities, increased income-generating\noptions). In purely economic terms, these findings pertaining to\nboth the feasibility and opportunity cost of achieving parasite\nelimination underscore the well-known principle that opting for first-\nbest efforts, such as eradication or elimination, is unlikely to be\nattainable in a second-best world [39\u201341]. Instead, they suggest that\nPareto optimality under these circumstances may be better achieved\nby opting for second-best strategies, such as disease control, ie.,\noptimal policy must crucially account for the feasibility of\nimplementing proposed strategies [40\u201342].\nAlthough the results of the marginal cost-effectiveness analysis\ncarried out here has shed light on issues underlying the economic\noptimality of undertaking disease control versus eradication,\nparticularly that social welfare may be maximized at levels of\nparasite control below eradication levels, it is restricted in its scope\nas it does not address the continuous nature of investment that\nwould be required to maintain disease control (which clearly\nmakes eradication optimal if technically feasible [43,44]) and the\nissue of uncertainty in the possibility of achieving eradication. The\nlatter is an overriding issue for the development of optimal LF\nintervention strategies given the current imperfect scientific\nknowledge regarding transmission endpoint values, the duration\nand intensity of treatments required to achieve parasite elimina-\nTable 3.

Our primary finding\nis that when longer-term uncertainty about programme payoffs\nexists, there is value in developing and implementing flexible,\ndynamic approaches that focus on identifying and implementing\noptimal shorter-term strategies (such as disease control considered\nhere) which can be adjusted (switched to eradication or even long-\nterm disease control) according to future scientific progress [9\u201311].\nOur analysis illustrates that this is basically because any long-term\ndecision taken now under uncertainty has an opportunity cost in\nthat it eliminates the option of waiting for further information and\nhence the possibility of making better loss minimizing decisions\nlater. We have shown that this option value for flexible sequential-\ndecision making under eradication uncertainty can be large\ndepending on the nature and timing of flexibility and degree of\nuncertainty (Table 3); indeed we calculate that for moderate\nuncertainty (probability of eradication= 0.70), implementing\nflexible LF eradication strategies based on chronic disease control\ninitially can yield cost savings (or option values) of up to\nUS$12.0 million over the cost of implementing the alternate\ninflexible strategy focused solely on eradication currently being\nrecommended for the Republic of Tanzania (Fig. 4).\nAnalyses carried out in this study and the considerations above\nsuggest that although the aim of parasite eradication by the\ncurrent global initiative against LF is sound, laudable and likely\nachievable in areas of low to moderate endemicity, a strategy\nfocused primarily or solely on eradication in every location,\nespecially those where the baseline mf prevalence is high, could be\nsub-optimal. Rather, we have shown that under those circum-\nstances and especially when there is initial uncertainty and there\nexists a possibility that knowledge and\/or technology for effectively\nachieving eradication will improve with time, it is more desirable\nand cost-efficient to achieve disease control at the first instance.\nThis can then be followed by a decision to intensify eradication\nattempts once baseline mf prevalences are reduced below the\ndisease control threshold of 3.55%. In this respect, it is important\nto acknowledge how the prospects of harnessing existing and new\nknowledge regarding chronic LF morbidity control and transmis-\nsion interruption, particularly the demonstrated value of local\nhygiene in treating lymphoedema [38,47,48], confirmation that\nMDA prevents and possibly reverses pre-existing LF-related\nlymphedoema and\/or hydrocele [13], and a more rapid\nachievement of transmission cessation by adding vector control\nsuch as insecticide treated bed nets to MDA [49,50], into the\nglobal strategy are likely to improve the feasibility of effective and\nsustainable parasite eradication. It is also instructive to note that\nmorbidity due to blindness was achieved much more readily than\ntransmission interruption in the case of the intervention pro-\ngramme against the closely related filarial disease, onchocerciasis,\nin both Africa and Latin America [51,52]. Finally, it is important\nto recognize that parasite management programmes are embed-\nded within and affected by real-world social-ecological systems\n[53,54]. Thus, implementing a sequential approach will support\neffective management of these programmes by allowing the\nincremental achievement of success by health agencies with its\nattendant boosting of organizational morale, accountability,\nlearning and competency [55,56].\nWe conclude that these results indicate that current debates\nabout disease control and eradication must include and take\ncareful account of these factors so that richer and more\ncomprehensive evaluative frameworks than simple epidemiological\nand investment appraisals can be developed and applied to\nachieve the control or elimination of human infectious diseases,\nparticularly those occurring in the developing world.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Details of data and studies used in the analysis shown\nin Figure 1.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0002936.s001 (0.17 MB\nDOC)\nText S1 Adequacy of fit of the logistic dose-response regression\nmodel with a threshold\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0002936.s002 (0.03 MB\nDOC)\nFigure S1 Logit proportions ( = log odds) of chronic LF disease\nagainst individual study (open circles) and pentiles (closed circles)\nof mf prevalence (%) values.
