One way to reduce this nitrate load is to restore wetlands at suitable 5 \nlocations between croplands and receiving waters to remove run-off nitrate through 6 \ndenitrification. This research investigated denitrification potential (DP) of different land 7 \nuses and its controlling factors in an agricultural watershed in the lower Mississippi 8 \nvalley (LMV) to help identify sites with high DP for reducing run-off nitrate. Soil 9 \nsamples collected from seven land-use types of an agricultural watershed during spring, 10 \nsummer, fall and winter were incubated in the laboratory for DP determination. Low-11 \nelevation clay soils in wetlands exhibited 6.3 and 2.5 times greater DP compared to high-12 \nelevation silt loam and low-elevation clay soils in croplands, respectively. DP of 13 \nvegetated-ditches was 1.3 and 4.2 times that of un-vegetated ditches and cultivated soils, 14 \nrespectively.  Soil carbon and nitrogen availability, bulk density, and soil moisture 15 \nsignificantly affected DP. These factors were significantly influenced in turn by 16 \nlandscape position and land-use type of the watershed. It is evident from these results that 17 \nlow-elevation, fine-textured soils under natural wetlands are the best locations for 18 \nmediating nitrate loss from agricultural watersheds in the LMV. Landscape position and 19 \nland-use types can be used as indices for the assessment\/modeling of denitrification 20 \npotential and identification of sites for restoration for nitrate removal in agricultural 21 \nwatersheds.  22 \n23 \n 3 \n1. INTRODUCTION 1 \nThe primary source of increased nitrate in surface waters is nitrogen (N) fertilizer 2 \napplied to croplands (USEPA 1996). An increase in the nitrate concentration of water 3 \nbodies is correlated with increased agricultural activity in river watersheds (Smith et al. 4 \n1987; Galloway et al. 2003). Nitrogen fertilizer use in the US increased by 300% from 5 \n1961 to 1999 and current usage consumes 13% of the inorganic N fertilizer used globally 6 \n(Howarth et al. 2002). Thus, expansion of agricultural activities coupled with an 7 \nincreased use of synthetic N fertilizer in the US has resulted in excessive accumulations 8 \nof reactive N in environments external to croplands (Galloway 2002; Howarth et al. 9 \n2002). 10 \nExtensive agricultural development and N fertilizer use over the past 200 years in 11 \nthe Mississippi River basin has increased nitrate loading into the river and the northern 12 \nGulf of Mexico (Turner and Rabalais 2003). Since the 1950\u2019s,  N fertilizer use has 13 \nincreased 20-fold in the basin (Battaglin and Goolsby 1996), which has contributed to a 14 \n3-fold increase in the nitrate load of the Mississippi River (Turner and Rabalais 1994; 15 \nDonner 2004). Agricultural run-off contributes about 74% of the current nitrate  loading 16 \ncarried by the Mississippi River (Rabalais et al. 2002) and the increased nitrate loading is 17 \ncited as one of the major causes of the extensive hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico 18 \n(Rabalais et al. 2002). A 30% reduction of the N load delivered by the Mississippi River 19 \nhas been recommended to reduce the hypoxia (EPA 2001; Mitsch et al. 2001). 20 \nThe Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMV) has lost about 80% of its 21 \nbottomland hardwood forests to other land uses primarily agriculture (Allen et al. 2001). 22 \nThe LMV was the largest floodplain ecosystem in the US covering about 23,300-km\n2\n 23 \n 4 \narea. Bottomland hardwood forests covered this floodplain and were flooded seasonally 1 \nas a result of over-bank flooding by the Mississippi River. Due to growth in agriculture, 2 \nthe bottomland hardwoods were cleared, drained, ditched and cultivated for decades for 3 \nrow crop cultivation. This practice not only led to the loss of the NO3 sinks in the form of 4 \ngreater denitrification rates of bottomland wetlands (Hunter and Faulkner 2001), but 5 \nenhanced its potential of loading additional nitrate into surface waters including the 6 \nMississippi River through N fertilizer use, soil erosion (Mitsch et al. 2005; Rebich 2001; 7 \nARS 2001), mineralization of organic nitrogen, and direct drainage of the cultivated 8 \nlands. 9 \nMeasures and research recommended by Mitsch et al. (2001) and Mitsch and Day 10 \n(2006) for reducing the NO3 loading of the Gulf of Mexico from the Mississippi River 11 \nbasin include a) on-farm soil and N fertilizer management to enhance N use efficiency, b) 12 \nalternative cropping and management systems for reducing N loss from croplands, and c) 13 \ncreation or restoration of wetlands and riparian ecosystems at suitable locations between 14 \ncroplands and water bodies to remove run-off nitrate before its outfall into the river. Like 15 \nelsewhere in the basin, restoration of forested and riparian wetlands to reduce run-off 16 \nnitrate through plant uptake and denitrification (Lowrance et al. 1984, Comin et al. 1997) 17 \nin the LMV is recommended (Lindau et al. 1994). Moreover, re-connecting forested and 18 \nriparian wetlands with the rivers for over-bank flooding is another measure suggested for 19 \nnitrate removal from river water in the LMV (Mitsch and Day 2006; Lindau et al. 1994; 20 \nLowrance et al. 1997). Denitrification is one of the major biological processes for nitrate 21 \nremoval from soil and water. Soil organic carbon and NO3 contents, moisture, 22 \ntemperature and texture affect the rate and extent of denitrification (Galloway et al. 23 \n 5 \n2003). The status of these physicochemical soil properties are the result of interactions of 1 \ntopography, soil hydrology and soil management at basin and sub-watershed scales in the 2 \nlandscape (Florinsky et al. 2004; Lowrance et al. 1997; Peterjohn and Correll 1984). 3 \nTherefore, it is important to discern the effects of topographic and landuse attributes on 4 \ndenitrification potential of agricultural watersheds. 5 \nAgricultural watersheds in the LMV are not homogenous croplands, but are a 6 \nmosaic of land uses including well, moderately and poorly drained soils under row crop 7 \ncultivation, a network of drainage ditches and access roads, patches of bottomland 8 \nhardwood forests and depressional wetlands. Based on the current land use, hydrology, 9 \nand landscape position, these different land use types can either enhance or retard 10 \ndenitrification. Maintaining environmentally sound crop production in the LMV and 11 \nreducing nitrate loading into aquatic ecosystems warrants investigation of landscape and 12 \nenvironmental factors regulating denitrification potential in agricultural watersheds.  13 \nSuch research-based information is important for the assessment\/modeling of 14 \ndenitrification potential at watershed scale and identification of sites for wetland 15 \nrestoration (White and Fennessy 2005) in the LMV. To our knowledge, there are no 16 \nscientific studies available on this topic in the LMV. Our objectives were to 1) determine 17 \ndenitrification potential of different land use types of an agricultural watershed in the 18 \nLMV, and 2) identify some of the environmental and landscape\/land-use management 19 \nfactors regulating the denitrification potentials. 20 \n2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 21 \n2.1 Study Area 22 \n The study area is the 8.5 km\n2\n Beasley Lake watershed in Sunflower County, 23 \nMississippi (Figure 1) in which about 0.25 km\n2 \narea is covered by the Beasley Lake. The 24 \n 6 \nwatershed is part of the Yazoo delta region of Northwestern Mississippi formed by the 1 \nalluvial deposits of the Mississippi River and its tributaries (Fisk 1951). Soils of the 2 \nwatershed range from coarse-textured silty-loam and loam deposits to fine-textured clay 3 \nalluvium. Dominant soil series of the watershed are Sharkey clay (non-acidic 4 \nmontmorrilinitic, Vertic Haplaquept), Dowling (Very-fine, smectitic, nonacid, thermic 5 \nVertic Endoaquept), Alligator (Very-fine, smectitic, thermic Chromic Dystraquert), 6 \nDundee (Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Typic Endoaqualf), Dubbs silt loam (Fine-7 \nsilty, mixed, active, thermic Typic Hapludalf), and Forestdale (Fine, smectitic, thermic 8 \nTypic Endoaqualf), (NRCS 1959).  9 \nThe elevation gradient between the highest and lowest points in the watershed is 5.5 10 \nmeters. Current land uses consist of high (Ag-high) and low (Ag-low) elevation 11 \ncroplands, vegetated ditches (veg-ditches), un-vegetated ditches (unveg-ditches), natural 12 \nforested wetland and depressional wetlands.  Forested wetlands are dominated by 13 \nbottomland hardwood tree species such as American elm (Ulmus americana), Water oak 14 \n(Quercus nigra), Pin oak (Quercus phellos), Green ash (Fraxinus pensylvanica) Red 15 \nmaple (Acer ruburum), and Hackberry (Celtis leavigata). FW cover about 1.2 km\n2\n area in 16 \nthe watershed.  Depressional wetlands (~0.1 km\n2\n area) are small depressions next to 17 \nBeasley Lake, which remain ponded during winter and spring and are dominated by 18 \nsubmerged and emergent wetland vegetation such as Potamogeton spp., Sagittaria spp., 19 \nScirpus spp. Typha spp., Nymphaea spp. Andropogon and Panicum species usually grow 20 \non the drier banks of the depressions. These depressions are the remnants of the swale 21 \nand ridge topographic features of an ox-bow lake watershed where the swales developed 22 \ninto depressional wetlands. Ag-high (~5.3 km\n2\n) landuse covers mainly well-drained soils 23 \n 7 \nwhile Ag-low ( ~ 1.5 km\n2\n) covers poorly drained soils next to depressional wetlands and 1 \nforested wetlands. A low elevation natural ditch next to the forested wetland was 2 \ndeveloped into a constructed wetland (~0.01 km\n2\n) in spring of 2002 through excavation 3 \nand installation of a water control structure to increase the aerial extent of the flooded 4 \nsoil. About 0.2 km\n2\n high and low-elevation croplands of the watershed drained into the 5 \nconstructed wetland.  The heavy clay soil of the constructed wetland was similar to that 6 \nof the nearby natural wetlands. The Sharky and Dowling clay soil of the constructed 7 \nwetland supported Potamogton spp., Sagittaria spp.  Typha spp. Panicum spp., and 8 \nAndropogon spp. The constructed wetland remained ponded in spring, fall and winter like 9 \nthat of depressional wetlands.  10 \nThe major management activity in the watershed is crop cultivation. Cotton and corn 11 \nare grown in the Ag.high croplands while soybean is grown in the Ag-low croplands with 12 \nconventional tillage system. Recreational land uses include fishing and hunting in the 13 \nBeasley Lake and in forested wetlands. Overhead irrigation is applied as needed for crop 14 \ncultivation. Irrigation run-off and rain water are drained through the ditches into Beasley 15 \nLake. Due to cultivation and the shunting of agricultural runoff directly to the lake, 16 \nsedimentation in the lake has increased to a degree where it now threatens its ecology 17 \n(ARS 2001). Maintaining ditches under grass cover is one of the best management 18 \npractices (BMP) implemented in the watershed by USDA to help reduce sedimentation in 19 \nBeasley Lake (Rebich 2001). The dimension of the ditches ranges from 1 to 3 meters 20 \nwide and 1-2 meter deep in the high-elevation areas and upto 5 meters wide and 4 meters 21 \ndeep in the low-elevation areas of the watershed. The banks of the veg.ditches are 22 \nstabilized by planting and maintaining switch grass (Panincum spp.) 23 \n 8 \nSeven land use types of the watershed were selected for this research (Ag-high, Ag-1 \nlow, veg-ditches, unveg-ditches, forested wetlands, depressional wetlands and the 2 \nconstructed wetland). Eight sampling points were selected randomly in each land use 3 \ntype. Four soil cores (0-10 cm deep; 3 cm dia.) were collected from each sampling point 4 \nof the seven land-use types of the watershed using a hand auger in March 2002, July 5 \n2002, October 2002 and January 2003. The four cores from each sampling point were 6 \ncomposited and were transferred to the laboratory on ice and refrigerated at 4 \no\nC under 7 \ntheir original moisture content levels (field-moisture condition) for further analysis. 8 \n2.2 Denitrification Potential (DP) 9 \n The inherent capacity of a soil to reduce and denitrify nitrate to N2 gas under an 10 \nunlimited supply of nitrate using organic carbon as an energy source under anaerobic 11 \nconditions is called denitrification enzyme assay (Beauchamp and Bergstrom 1993; 12 \nGroffman et al.1999). This assay measures the amount of denitrification enzymes 13 \navailable at the time of soil sampling. We modified this procedure by amending the soil 14 \nslurries only with nitrate as we were interested in the denitrification potential (DP) of the 15 \ndifferent land use types under their existing soil carbon contents using the C2H2 block 16 \ntechnique (Hill and Cardaci 2004). It is well established that adding carbon to nitrate 17 \namended slurries will increase denitrification rates (Hunter and Faulkner 2001; Groffman 18 \nand Crawford 2003), however there is no practical way of increasing soil carbon at the 19 \nlandscape scale. Therefore, this approach is a more realistic evaluation of the existing 20 \nability of the different landscape units to remove nitrate from surface or ground water.  21 \nFor the purpose of this study DP is defined as the capacity of soil slurries to denitrify 22 \nnitrate under anoxic conditions at room temperature (22 degress Celcius). Field moist 23 \n 9 \nsoils were thoroughly homogenized by hand and brought to room temperature overnight 1 \nbefore incubation. The next morning, six sub samples (moist equivalent of10 g dry soil) 2 \nof the homogenized soil from each of the eight soil samples from each of the seven land 3 \nuse types were weighed into  6 replicate serum bottles (150 mL). Fifteen mL of 10 mg 4 \nNO3\n-\n L\n-1\n solution and 5 ml of de-ionized water were added to three of the six bottles to 5 \ndeliver 15 \u00b5g of NO3\n-\n g\n-1\n dry soil, while 20 mL of de-ionized water was added to the 6 \nremaining three bottles. The bottles were then capped airtight and purged with O2-free N2 7 \ngas for 20 minutes to induce anaerobic conditions. Ten percent of the serum bottle 8 \nheadspace was replaced with cleaned C2H2 gas to block the bacterial conversion of N2O 9 \nto N2 gas. The bottles were then wrapped in Al foil and put on a reciprocating shaker for 10 \ncontinuous shaking at room temperature (22 to 25 \no\nC). Headspace gas samples were 11 \ncollected at 2, 4 and 6 hours with a syringe and stored in Beckton Dikinson 12 \nVacutainers\u00ae. The gas samples were analyzed on a Tremetrics 9001GC having a 13 \nporapack Q column with ECD detector for N2O concentration determination. The rate of 14 \nN2O production was calculated in ug N-N2O g\n-1\n h\n-1\n using the 3 gas sample readings 15 \nduring the 6 hour incubation. Adjustments were made for soluble N2O in the bottles using 16 \na Bunsen absorption coefficient of 0.54 at 25 \no\nC.  17 \n2.3 Anaerobically Mineralizable Organic Carbon (AMOC) 18 \n Denitrification depends directly on the amount of mineralizable organic C 19 \navailable to the denitrifier population under anaerobic conditions (Singh et al. 1988; Gale 20 \net al. 1992). Since denitrification is an anaerobic process, the amount of mineralizable 21 \norganic C available under anaerobic conditions would help explain any trend in the DP 22 \namong different land use types. Field moist soil (equivalents of 5 g oven-dried soil) from 23 \n 10 \neach soil sample were weighed into 150 mL duplicate serum bottles. Twenty ml of 50 mg 1 \nNO3\n-\n L\n-1\n solution was added into each bottle, which delivered 200 \u00b5g NO3\n-\n g\n-1\n soil. The 2 \nbottles were capped airtight and purged with oxygen-free N2 gas for 20 minutes to induce 3 \nanaerobic conditions. After purging, the bottles were wrapped in aluminum foil and were 4 \nshaken for 15 minutes on a reciprocating shaker. After shaking, the bottles were stored at 5 \nroom temperature (22-25 \no\nC). The headspaces of the bottles were sampled with a syringe 6 \nat 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours of incubation and stored in 5-mL Beckton Dikinson 7 \nVacutainers\u00ae. The gas samples were analyzed on a Tremetric 9001 GC fitted with a 8 \nmethanizer and an FID detector for CO2 concentration determination (Ullah et al. 2005). 9 \nThe gas production over the length of incubation remained linear in all the landuse types. 10 \nThe amount of CO2 produced was calculated as \u00b5g C-CO2 g\n-1\n h\n-1\n. Corrections were made 11 \nfor soluble CO2 in the incubation bottles by using the Bunsen Adsorption coefficient of 12 \n0.752 at 25 \no\nC. 13 \n2.4 Total soil carbon and nitrogen 14 \n Total soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) were determined using a Thermo Finnigan 15 \nCNS Analyzer. Soil samples were oven dried, pulverized and thoroughly homogenized.   16 \nA sub-sample of about 35 mg was weighed into a tin capsule for automated analysis to 17 \ndetermine concentrations of organic C and total N.  These values and bulk density 18 \nmeasurements were used to calculate Mt of C and N ha\n-1\n. 19 \n2.5 Soil nitrate, bulk density, porosity, water-filled pore space and texture  20 \nField-moist soil equivalents of 5 g oven-dried soil were weighed into 250 mL 21 \nduplicate bottles. Fifty mL of 2M KCL solution was added to each bottle. The bottles 22 \nwere put on a reciprocating shaker for continuous shaking for 1 hour. After shaking, the 23 \n 11 \nbottles were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min and were then filtered into 20 mL 1 \nscintillation vials through a No. 42 Whatman filter paper. The samples were stored in a 2 \nfreezer until analysis for nitrate on a Lachat automated flow injection analyzer. Average 3 \nvalues for each soil sample were determined and reported in mg N Kg\n-1\n oven-dried soil. 4 \nAt each land use type eight intact soil cores ( 2.5 cm dia. x 10 cm long) were taken and 5 \ntransferred to the lab for the determination of soil moisture and bulk density. Soil 6 \nporosity was determined using the equation of 1- (bulk density\/particle density). Percent 7 \nwater-filled pore space (WFPS) was determined  for each landuse type for all season 8 \naccording to Ullah et al. (2005). Soil particle size distribution was determined by the 9 \nfiltration method according to Sheldrick and Wang (1993).  10 \n2.6 Statistical Analysis 11 \nDifferences in DP among the landscape units within each season were analyzed 12 \nby a two-way analysis of variance using the General Linear Model in SAS (SAS Institute 13 \n1998). Landscape was treated as main effect, nitrate amendment was treated as a sub-plot 14 \neffect and season was treated as repeated measures variable in the ANOVA model. Post 15 \nANOVA tests were conducted with Fisher\u2019s protected LSD at 5% significance level. 16 \nLinear regression of the yearly averaged DP on total soil C, N, and bulk density of the 7 17 \nland use types was done using SAS. Significant differences in physio-chemical properties 18 \nof soils of the 7 land use types were determined using one-way ANOVA.  Pearson 19 \ncorrelation coefficients among DP, AMOC and soil moisture were calculated for each 20 \nseason. The data were analyzed for normality and homogeneity of variance of the 21 \nresiduals using the proc univariate procedure in SAS and Shapiro-wilk test of normality 22 \nof the residual at p> 0.05. 23 \n 12 \n 1 \n3. RESULTS 2 \n3.1 Landscape position and Landuse type effects on Denitrification Potential 3 \nThe natural and constructed wetlands had significantly greater (p < 0.05) DP than 4 \nthe Ag-high and Ag-low sites in all seasons (Figures 2). Forested wetlands showed the 5 \nhighest DP while Ag-high showed the lowest during the four seasons when additional 6 \nNO3 was added during the assay compared to their unamended soils (Figures 2 and 3). 7 \nThe DP of forested wetlands was 4.5 to 11 times greater than the Ag-high during the 8 \nyear. Similarly, the forested wetlands showed 2.4 to 4.3 times greater DP than the Ag-low 9 \nsites in all the seasons. Except in summer, Ag-high and Ag-low had similar DP values (p 10 \n> 0.05).  On average, forested wetlands exhibited 3.0 and 2.7 times greater DP than those 11 \nof veg-ditches and unveg-ditches, respectively (Table 1). 12 \n Depressional and constructed wetlands showed similar DPs, except in summer 13 \nwhen depressional wetlands had 1.5 times greater DP than the constructed wetland. On 14 \naverage both depressional and constructed wetlands had 3.7 to 7.4 and 1.2 to 3.7 times 15 \ngreater (p < 0.05) DP than that of the Ag-high and Ag-low respectively during the four 16 \nseasons. Depressional and constructed wetlands also showed 1.2 and 1.6 times greater DP 17 \nthan veg.ditches and unveg-ditches, respectively, but were less than the DP of forested 18 \nwetlands (Table 1). 19 \n  When the DP of individual land use types were averaged for the four seasons 20 \n(Table 1), the DP of veg-ditches was 4.1 times of the Ag-high (p <0.05) and 1.7 times of 21 \nAg-low, although statistically not significant (p > 0.05). Moreover, veg-ditches had 1.3 22 \ntimes greater DP than unveg-ditches. On the whole forested wetlands exhibited 23 \n 13 \nsignificantly greater DP (p <0.05) than the rest of the land use types. Similarly, 1 \ndepressional and constructed wetlands had higher DP than unveg-ditches, Ag-high and 2 \nAg-low sites (Table 1), but had lower DP than the forested wetlands. The DP of veg-3 \nditches was more variable and thus was not significantly different than Ag-low, unveg-4 \nditches, constructed and depressional wetlands (p > 0.05). 5 \n3.2 Environmental variables and Denitrification Potential 6 \nAmong the environmental variables measured, nitrate amendment, season, 7 \norganic carbon availability, bulk density and %WFSP contents significantly influenced 8 \nDP of all the land use types. When amended with additional nitrate, forested and 9 \ndepressional wetland soils showed 55% and 67% greater DP compared to the DP of soil 10 \nwithout nitrate additions (Figures 2 and 3). Constructed wetland and unveg-ditches 11 \nshowed an increase in DP with NO3 enrichment during fall and winter only while veg-12 \nditches responded to nitrate addition in summer and fall. Ag-high and Ag-low soil did not 13 \nrespond in terms of increased DP to nitrate amendment during the four seasons (Table 1), 14 \nwhich shows that their DPs were limited by factors other than nitrate, probably by the 15 \navailability of organic C and lack of anaerobosis. 16 \n Season significantly affected the DPs of all the land uses except Ag-high and 17 \nunveg-ditches (Table 1). When the DPs of all the land use types were averaged together 18 \nand tested for a seasonal effect, the winter DP was found the lowest than the rest of the 19 \nseasons. Lower winter soil temperatures are speculated to have limited the denitrifier 20 \nactivity. Similar seasonal effect on denitrification potential of forested wetland soils in 21 \nthe LMV was observed by Hunter and Faulkner (2001). 22 \n 14 \nSignificant differences in a number of soil properties among the different land use 1 \ntypes were observed (Table 2). Wetlands had 1.8 times greater total soil organic C than 2 \nthe cultivated soils. Higher soil organic C in wetlands contributed to improved soil 3 \nstructure resulting in lower bulk densities and high soil porosities in wetlands than the 4 \nAg-high and Ag-low sites.  Anaerobic incubation of soils from the 7 land use types 5 \nshowed that the amount of anaerobically mineralizable organic carbon (AMOC) in 6 \nwetlands soil was 1.4 times those of the cultivated soils (Table 3). Similarly, veg-ditch 7 \nsoil had a relatively lower soil bulk density, higher porosity (Table 2) and 1.3 time 8 \ngreater AMOC values compared to those of the cultivated soils. Unveg-ditches had 9 \nsimilar soil bulk density, porosity and AMOC values to those of the cultivated soils. High 10 \nAMOC values observed in the wetland and veg-ditch soils supported greater DP 11 \ncompared to those in the cultivated soils. AMOC showed a significant correlation with 12 \nDP of nitrate amended soils during the four seasons (p<0.05).  AMOC values of the 13 \nspring, summer, fall and winter significantly correlated with DP (p <0.05) with r value of 14 \n0.51, 0.57, 0.75 and 0.81, respectively (Table 3).  Simple linear regression identified 15 \nsignificant influence of total soil N, C and bulk density on DP of the nitrate amended 16 \nsoils with r\n2\n values of 0.80 0.78, and 0.80 respectively. Soil moisture content also 17 \ncorrelated significantly with DP in each of the four seasons (Table 4). The Pearson\u2019s 18 \ncorrelation coefficients of spring, summer, fall and winter soil moisture with DP were 19 \n0.46, 0.44, 0.69 and 0.57 respectively at p <0.05. 20 \n4. DISCUSSION 21 \nSignificant differences in the DPs of nitrate ameneded soils of different land use 22 \ntypes (Figures 2 ) are attributed to differences in the position and management of 23 \n 15 \ndifferent land use types in the watershed. Low-lying heavy clay soil (Sharkey, Dowling 1 \nand Alligator soil series) under forested and depressional wetlands showed 6.3-fold 2 \ngreater DPs than the Ag-high silt-loam soils. Groffman and Tiedje (1989) reported 3 \nsimilar observation of significant influence of soil texture and drainage (surrogates for 4 \nlandscape position) class in forest soils on denitrification potentials. Mohn et al. (2000) 5 \nalso found low denitrification rates in drained mounds compared to wetland soils. Our 6 \ndata shows that landscape position is a significant regulator of DP in soils as poorly-7 \ndrained, fine-textured soils in natural wetlands supported higher denitrifier activity than 8 \nthe coarse textured Ag-high soils. It is worthy to note that Ag-low soil had an average 2.5 9 \ntimes higher DP than that of Ag-high soils, which implies that topographic position led to 10 \nthe explicit differences in DP of these sites. 11 \nAs expected, forested, depressional and constructed wetlands exhibited 3.0, 2.0 12 \nand 2.1 times greater DP than the pedogenically similar (Table 2) Ag-low soils, 13 \nrespectively. Drainage and cultivation of the Ag-low soils over the years led to lower 14 \navailable organic C substrate (Table 2) and moisture contents (Table 4), which resulted in 15 \nlower denitrifier activity compared to similar soils under wetlands in the watershed. In 16 \nanother study in the same watershed, we observed significantly greater denitrification 17 \nrates in forested wetlands  than the rates of an adjacent cultivated site under variable soil 18 \nmoisture contents (Ullah et al. 2005), demonstrating that cultivation diminished the 19 \ncapacity of these soils to denitrify nitrate at rates similar to forested wetlands. The natural 20 \nvegetation cover and the resulting soil litter production in forested and depressional 21 \nwetlands provide higher organic carbon substrate for supporting greater denitrifier 22 \nactivity than similar textured Ag-low soils. This observation implies that pedogenically 23 \n 16 \nsimilar soils at the same elevation in a watershed under row crops cultivation sustain 1 \nlower denitrification potential than under wetlands. 2 \nThe higher denitrifier activity in the veg-ditches is attributed to its maintenance as 3 \na grassed waterway, which resulted in maintaining high soil moisture regime and 4 \nproducing greater AMOC contents compared to croplands and unveg-ditches. This 5 \nfinding supports the current practices of maintaining veg-ditches as a BMP for erosion 6 \ncontrol and water quality improvement as recommended by the USDA (ARS 2001) in the 7 \nregion. 8 \nThe DPs observed in spring, summer and fall of all the land use types were 9 \nsignificantly greater (p <0.05) than their DPs of winter except Ag.high and unveg-ditch 10 \nsoils (Table 2), respectively. This observation suggests that the lower average winter soil 11 \ntemperatures (ranging from 6 to 9 \no\nC) and higher % WFPS substantially reduced soil 12 \ndenitrifier activity (Table 4). Lower winter temperatures and higher WFPS percentage 13 \ncompared to the summer values suppressed microbial activity (Magg et al. 1997) and 14 \nreduced the supply of mineralizable organic C to denitrifiers (Table 3) (Mohn et al. 2000; 15 \nMogge et al. 1998; Klein and Logtestijn 1996). Even though %WFPS of soils in winter 16 \nwere relatively lower than the fall %WFPS, lower winter temperature led to significantly 17 \nlower AMOC production than the fall values of all the land use types (Table 3). This 18 \nindicates that lower soil temperature exerts significant controls over microbial activity.  19 \nLower denitrifier activity may pose greater risk of nitrate loss from agricultural 20 \nwatersheds in winter. 21 \nUnlike the Ag-high and Ag-low soils, nitrate availability was found limiting DPs 22 \nin forested and depressional wetlands, because nitrate additions to these soils led to 23 \n 17 \nincreases in DPs during the four seasons  compared to DPs of Ag-high and Ag-low sites 1 \n(Figures 2 and 3). When averaged over the four seasons, forested and depressional 2 \nwetlands showed 3 and 4-fold increase in DP under additional nitrate compared to the 3 \nunamended soils. Higher denitrification rates under additional nitrate can happen, if the 4 \nprocess is not limited by the availability of organic C (Weier et al. 1993). No response of 5 \nAg-high and Ag-low soils to nitrate amendment shows that DP in these land uses was 6 \nlimited by the availability of organic C (Table 1). Constructed wetland responded with 7 \nincreased DP to nitrate additions in fall and winter only. The increase in DP of the 8 \nconstructed wetland in response to nitrate additions after 6-9 months of its construction 9 \ndemonstrate that wetland restoration on abandoned marginal lands in low-elevation areas 10 \nof the watershed can enhance denitrifier activity within and\/or after the first growing 11 \nseason. Veg-ditches also responded with increased DPs to nitrate additions. These results 12 \ndepicts that wetlands and veg-ditches can denitrify additional nitrate coming from 13 \ncultivated soils or other external sources. This finding is in agreement with the findings 14 \nof similar studies conducted regarding nitrate removal potential of riparian wetlands and 15 \nvegetated buffer-strips in agricultural watersheds (Lindau et al. 1994; Lowrance et al. 16 \n1995; Groffman and Crawford 2003; Groffman et al. 2002; Ingrid-Brettar et al. 2002; 17 \nClement et al. 2002; DeLaune, et al. 2005). 18 \nAs expected, higher total soil carbon, mineralizable organic C, wetter soil 19 \nconditions, greater soil porosity and fine-clay texture of natural and constructed wetlands 20 \n(Table 2) supported greater denitrifier activity than those observed in the Ag-high and the 21 \npedogenically similar Ag-low and unveg-ditch soils. This result is in agreement with the 22 \nfindings of Hill and Cardaci (2002), Davidsson  and Stahl (2000), and Groffman and 23 \n 18 \nTiedje (1989) who reported significant control of denitrification potential by available 1 \norganic carbon, soil moisture contents and soil texture classes. At the biogeochemical 2 \nscale, soil moisture content, soil texture, available C and nitrate are the major regulators 3 \nof denitrifier activity in soils (Patrick and Reddy, 1976; Myrold et al.1998; Weitz et al. 4 \n2001) and the same factors were found significantly affecting DPs in the Beasley 5 \nwatershed. The status of these biogeochemical scale regulators of DP is a result of the 6 \ninteraction of soil oxygen diffusion rate\/dynamics, landscape position, plant community 7 \nstructure, physical disruption (landuse), ecosystem type, microbial biomass, and organic 8 \nmatter production characteristics of a given landscape unit (Myrold et al.1998; Florinsky, 9 \net al. 2004). Florinsky et al. (2004) reported significant control of denitrifier activity in 10 \nsoils by landscape position of a site and its subsequent influence on soil moisture and 11 \norganic carbon availability. The authors concluded that higher denitrifying activity in 12 \nlow-elevation areas was mostly affected by the redistribution and accumulation of soil 13 \nmoisture and available organic carbon due to their additional gains from high-elevation 14 \nareas along the slope (Florinskey, et al. 2004). In the Beasley watershed, lower elevation 15 \nland uses under wetlands maintained higher soil moisture contents, greater soil organic 16 \ncarbon pools, and lower bulk densities that resulted in higher DP in wetland soils than 17 \neither the high elevation or low elevation soils under cultivation. These findings show 18 \nthat landscape position and landuse type exerts significant controls on denitrifying 19 \nactivity in a watershed. Any effort to model and predict denitrification potential at 20 \nwatersheds scale such as the LMV should include topographic and land use aspects of a 21 \nwatershed as key controllers of DP besides the biogeochemical scale variables in the 22 \nmodeling process. Such an approach can help compute\/predict relatively more realistic 23 \n 19 \nDPs at watershed scale and identify sites for restoration in large river basins (White and 1 \nFennessy, 2005). Application of digital terrain models for predicting microbial activities 2 \nof watersheds based on inputs of both biogeochemical and landscape scale variables into 3 \nthe model have been found feasible in Canada (Florinsky et al. 2004). 4 \nThe results of this research demonstrate that denitrification potential in soils is 5 \nregulated by more than one biogeochemical scale factor and is significantly influenced by 6 \nboth the landscape position and land use types in a watershed. Marshal (1999), Groffman 7 \net al. (1999), and Florinsky et al (2004) also reported that denitrification cannot be 8 \npredicted on the basis of one factor, rather a combination of factors are involved in the 9 \nregulation of the denitrification process. Therefore, it is suggested to consider landscape 10 \nscale variables (landscape position and land use type) in addition to biogeochemical scale 11 \nvariables in assessing\/modeling denitrification potential of soils and identification of sites 12 \nfor wetland restoration for water quality improvement in the LMV. Our findings suggest 13 \nthat fine-textured low-elevation sites in agricultural watersheds are the best candidates for 14 \nwetland restoration for nitrate removal in the LMV. Such sites can accumulate higher soil 15 \norganic carbon and retain higher soil moisture for sustaining persistent and enhanced 16 \ndenitrification rates than coarse-textured Ag-high soils in agricultural watersheds. 17 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 18 \nThe authors are thankful to Dr. Kewei Yu, Louisiana State University Wetland 19 \nBiogeochemistry Institute, Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Mr. Michael Baldwin, USGS 20 \nNational Wetlands Research Center, Louisiana for their help during field sampling and 21 \nlaboratory analysis.
