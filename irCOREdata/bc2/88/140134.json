I will then go on to highlight seven issues that I regularly see companies\nwrestling with, before identifying why academic research often does not contribute as much\nto the development of practice as we would expect. I will then present what we do know, the\nsolutions that have been developed from practitioners and academics working together,\nbefore finally highlighting some of the enduring tensions in the field.\nThe past\nThe Balanced Scorecard is probably the best known of the raft of multi-dimensional\nperformance measurement frameworks developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They\nemerged at a time when financial measures were to the fore and the dysfunctional\nconsequences of running an enterprise solely on financial measures became widely apparent.\nThe introduction of the Balanced Scorecard heralded an era when the non-financial measures\nthat drive the business could be identified and used to direct the organisation in the medium\nto long term. The expectation was that the introduction of multi-dimensional key\nperformance indicators (KPIs) would solve all the problems.\nBut reality was very different. In some respects, non-financial KPIs are more difficult to\ndesign and use than accounting measures. We have years of experience and august\naccounting bodies devoted to financial measurement, management and reporting, whilst the\ntheory and practice of performance measurement is relatively new. In practice, the result was:\n\uf0b7 Companies developed Balanced Scorecards by taking their existing KPIs and\npopulating the four scorecard perspectives. This created a balance of financial and\nnon-financial measures but rarely reflected strategy or created direction and purpose.\n\uf0b7 Departments created measures that reflected their own internal logic. When these\nmeasures were not linked to strategy, the measures encouraged local optimisation and\norganisational malfunction.\n\uf0b7 Measures became linked with performance appraisals and bonuses. People became\nadept at delivering the KPI results. But everyone forgot that a KPI is an indicator, not\nactual performance itself.\n\uf0b7 The expected performance improvement did not happen. Performance improvement\ndoes not simply come from measuring. Performance comes from the processes and\npractices and how effectively people execute them. Measurement just keeps the score.\nSo, to improve, you need to change what you do, or do it more effectively, something\nthat measurement may encourage, but measurement alone does not create value.\nThe development of the frameworks was followed by the launch of some 30 different\nsoftware packages (Marr and Neely, 2004) designed to report performance to senior\nmanagement, to drill down into the data to problem solve and to dice and slice the\norganisation's performance through a myriad of dimensions. Although these developments in\ntechnology have made the gathering and analysis of data simpler and quicker, they are of\nlimited use unless the organisation develops effective ways of managing with measures.\nIn the last 20 years we have seen the majority of larger organisations take up Balanced\nScorecards to some extent (Franco-Santos et al., 2004), widespread use of KPIs, and the\ndevelopment of examples of good practice, but many issues remain.\nCurrent issues for practice\nBased on my experience, there are currently seven main issues for practitioners.\n1. Reviewing corporate performance \u2013 The Conference Board reports and other surveys\nsuggest that many companies have developed corporate-level scorecards and, for my\nexperience, have large and extensive KPI reports. However, the majority of the\norganisations I see have no effective way of reviewing these measures. They have\ndata rather than information to guide their decisions. Two organisations I have dealt\nwith recently typify this position. The first had a regular KPI report that the team\nflicked through in ten minutes during their monthly board meeting. The second\napproached me about assessing the comprehensiveness of their measures. When I\ntalked to the team of analysts on this subject, it emerged that the comprehensiveness\nof the measures was much less of a concern than the directors having the information\nin an understandable and useable form.\n2. Performance measurement not delivering \u2013 On many occasions the time and\ninvestment made in performance measurement is not seen to be delivering the\nexpected benefits. The performance improvement activities are not always linked to\nthe measures and aligned with the strategy. On the occasions when they are, the\nlinkages are not understood. I spent time with one organisation recently rebuilding\ntheir success map. The new map was not significantly better than the old one, but by\nengaging the managers in the rebuild, we created understanding and commitment to\nthe objectives.\n3. Cascading the measures \u2013 The companies that effectively cascaded their measures\ndown the organisation tend to have branch structures (e.g. supermarket chains, high\nstreet bank networks, branded fast food restaurants) where central resource can create\na single set of measures that is rolled out across the network. But in other\norganisations, the alignment of the measures and the strategic objectives becomes less\nand less clear the further down the organisation you go.\n4. Engaging the rank and file \u2013 Engaging the rank and file of the organisation in the\nmeasures is relatively easy, but organisations need to engage the whole organisation\nin performance. This is much harder and one reason why organisations do not perform\nbetter. Classic examples abound in the public sector, where performance targets\nproduce perverse behaviour. Four-hour targets in A&E departments can lead to faster\npatient processing, but one way of achieving the target is to admit all the patients who\nhave not been treated in the four hours. Moving beyond the counting mentality is\nmuch harder to do.\n5. Managing with measures \u2013 My previous point leads me to reflect that most\norganisations do not know how to manage with the measures they have. Many\nmeasurement charts show initial improvements followed by setbacks, with no\nconsistent direction or trend. On the other hand, when you go into a Toyota plant the\nrate and direction of the improvement is clear for all to see. In the latter case, they\nhave a tool set and a well-developed approach to performance improvement, whilst\nmost companies simply focus on poor performance when it becomes apparent.\n6. Keeping it up to date \u2013 Keeping the measures up to date with the latest data is a\nproblem in many organisations, but keeping the whole system up to date so it reflects\nthe latest strategic priorities is an even bigger task. Many organisations develop a\nscorecard, but it is rare to see organisations investing in the capability to review and\nupdate the system on a regular basis.\n7. Leadership \u2013 Finally, if measurement is simply about keeping the score, we need to\nmanage performance. But management itself is rather mechanistic. How do we\nprogress to performance leadership?\nGiven these seven issues, what do academics have to offer and how does academic research\ncontribute to the debate?\nCurrent academic issues\nAt the risk of upsetting some of my academic colleagues, I would argue that there are seven\nissues that militate against academia contributing to solving the practitioner issues I\nhighlighted above. These are:\n1. Academic rigour \u2013 Academics are becoming increasingly interested in methodology\nand academic rigour. The result is a set of journals where academics talk to\nthemselves and the relevance to practice can be lost.\n2. Focusing on minutiae \u2013 One consequence of increasing academic rigour is that we\nfocus on smaller and smaller problems. We refine existing models and test simply\nconstructed models of the world. The result is that big-picture problems are not\naddressed through academic research, and in particular we are short of longitudinal\nstudies following policies and changes through time.\n3. Academic disciplines \u2013 Academic research has developed core disciplines with most\nresearchers working within these disciplines. However, performance measurement\nand management are by their very nature cross-disciplinary, drawing from fields as\ndiverse as operations management, management accounting, sociology and\npsychology. We do not learn from our colleagues in other disciplines as often as we\nshould.\n4. \u201cHow to\u201d research \u2013 Much of the research in engineering and medicine revolves\naround how to do things. My belief is we are seeing less of this in management\nresearch, again creating a gap between academia and practice.\n5. Does performance measurement make a difference? \u2013 There is quite a body of\nacademic research based around \u201cDoes performance measurement\/Balanced\nScorecard make a real difference to performance?\u201d This is partly driven by\npractitioners' desire to be told that it does, but often all we provide is evidence that\nmanagers believe that it makes a difference. To show whether the use of performance\nmeasurement systems makes a difference or not requires longitudinal research (not\nsurveys), with widespread and detailed access to organisational performance data. We\nalso need to look much more carefully at the circumstances under which it makes a\ndifference rather than expecting there to be simplistic universal truths.\n6. The incentives are wrong \u2013 Academic promotion is based on publishing in academic\njournals. We do not reward the link to practice in the same way.\n7. Academics do not create \u2013 It is rare for a new practice to emerge from academia.\nGiven the relatively few academics wrestling with the problems of business compared\nto the millions of practitioners, this is not surprising. However, academics could aim\nat identifying new promising practices and disseminate them, directly or indirectly, to\npractitioners.\nGiven these issues, it is hard at times to engage academics. However, I would argue that the\nrole of academia has to be in the co-creation and dissemination of knowledge. This would\ninvolve working with practitioners in the development of approaches to solving their\nperformance issues; understanding why they work (or do not work) in specific organisational\nsituations and settings and translating the results into tools, techniques and approaches that\ncan be used again.\nWhat we do know\nTaking each of the practitioner issues in turn, let me present what we do already know.\n1. Reviewing corporate performance \u2013 Reviewing corporate performance relies on\ndeveloping an appropriate process. The performance planning value chain (Bourne,\n2004) and the work undertaken to use this with DHL in the UK (Neely et al., 2002)\nproduced one approach that translated a performance question into understanding and\naction. Undoubtedly this approach is not perfect, but it was sufficiently robust for\nDHL to adopt the same approach for managing its European Security operations.\nHere, practitioners have significant experience, but there are few attempts to capture\ngood practice and share it with a wider audience.\n2. Performance measurement not delivering \u2013 The results of many academic studies\nshow mixed results (Franco and Bourne, 2004), although the case studies give more\npositive results than the survey research. But in my opinion, more research is needed\nhere. Interestingly, the ideal research situation would be in companies that are rolling\nout measures across the organisation, where the process would allow observation of\nperformance before, during and after the intervention.\n3. Cascading the measures \u2013 Organisations like Tesco have developed and cascaded\ntheir measures. Tesco created a steering wheel (a five-perspective version of the\nBalanced Scorecard including an environmental perspective) which aligns\nmeasurement from the UK board level right down to individual stores (Bourne and\nBourne, 2007), and this is central to how they manage the operation. However, other\norganisations have taken different approaches. EDF Energy has developed an\napproach for cascading their success maps from the UK board, through their three\ndivisions down to individual team level (Martinez et al., 2006). This is in direct\ncontrast to cascading the measures, but creates alignment and encourages buy-in to\nperformance improvement.\n4. Engaging the rank and file \u2013 There are techniques and approaches for engaging\nmanagement in measurement. They revolve round structuring the debate to identify\nthe key stakeholder needs (Neely et al., 2002) and how to create a mental model\n(Eccles and Pyburn, 1992) or success map (Bourne and Bourne, 2007). But how we\nengage the whole of the organisation is not immediately clear. Here, we may have\nmore to learn from work being done in strategic HR management, as recent research\nsuggests that performance measurement will not deliver this on its own (Bourne et al.,\n2008).\n5. Managing with measures \u2013 Interestingly, a lot of work was done in the total quality\nmovement (TQM) on how we should use and manage with measures (e.g. Deming,\n1986), but little of this has really evolved outside the operational context in which it\nwas developed. Simons (1991) developed his levers of control from working closely\nwith a series of companies but these have not been developed more widely. Aspects\nand issues have been raised in the Beyond Budgeting literature (Hope and Fraser,\n2003) and the role of performance reviews (Martinez et al., 2006; Pavlov and Bourne,\n2007a, b, c) is emerging as an area of academic interest, but most organisations would\nbenefit greatly from applying the lessons of TQM to management.\n6. Keeping it up to date \u2013 The need to keep the performance measures up to date is\nwidely recognised. If they are not kept up to date, conflicts will arise between the\nmeasures and the strategy and between the measures and the appraisal system. The\nprocesses required for reviewing targets, measures, groups of measures and strategy\nhave been specified (Bourne et al., 2000), and the capabilities needed identified\n(Kennerley and Neely, 2002), but more collaborative research is needed into\nunderstanding how organisations maintain their fit with their environment and\ncontinue to survive and prosper in what is becoming an increasingly faster changing\nand more volatile business environment.\n7. Leadership \u2013 How we evolve from performance measurement, through performance\nmanagement to performance leadership, I expect will evolve over the next few years.\nThere has been considerable interest in top-down control and bottom-up creation of\nstrategy, but the idea of \u201cmiddle-out\u201d would sit much better with performance\nmeasurement.\nConclusion\nMy conclusion is that collaboration between academia and practice has developed a range of\napproaches for most of the current issues in performance measurement. These are not perfect,\nhave not been tested in multiple environments and are not always widely known, but they\nshould be a starting point for organisations trying to move forward. I also conclude, that co-\ncreation of solutions is also important, because all the solutions above came from a\ncombination of research and practice.\nBut I would like to finish by highlighting three real dilemmas that are facing performance\nmeasurement and management.\nFirstly, how do we create both ownership and direction? Direction has traditionally come\nfrom measures being cascaded down the organisation, reflecting the strategic imperatives,\nwhilst ownership has come from individuals creating and owning their own measures. EDF\nEnergy's approach to cascading success maps may be the solution, but seeing whether this\napproach works in different setting is important, so further research and collaboration here\nwould be beneficial.\nSecondly, how do we manage today whilst preparing for tomorrow? Performing well requires\na focus and deployment of resources that focuses on the near future. Preparing for tomorrow\nrequires slack resources that can be used in the transition. So in success we can sow the seeds\nof our own destruction. I understand the Balanced Scorecard perspective on this but I have\nnot seen a convincing approach to resolving this dilemma.\nThirdly, is performance measurement reaching the end of its life? Many of the problems of\nperformance measurement occur in large companies. But large companies should only exist\nwhen the economic circumstances favour them. From transaction economics, it could be\nargued that the cost of management coordination has to be less than the cost of inter-\norganisational transactions for the organisation to continue to exist. Perhaps what we have\nseen recently is the development of performance measurement to reduce the cost of the\nmanagement coordination. But will this approach succeed? New technology will mean that\noutsourcing will become increasingly less expensive especially with the development of web\nbased communications. Following this to its logical conclusion, one could predict the demise\nof the large organisation, growth of networks and greatly eliminate the need for performance\nmeasurement.\nUntil that happens, we will have to struggle with the insights and problems that performance\nmeasurement gives us.\nReferences\nBourne, M.C.S.
